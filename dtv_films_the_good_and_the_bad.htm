     of the films below have had limited theatrical release, have gone 
    straight to Video On Demand (VOD) or have gone Direct to Video (DTV). 
    There is a lot of good and bad stuff out there, some of which you may 
    have never heard of before. Many are little gems, while the majority 
    of them have gone this route for a reason. Below are literally 
    thousands of films released this way from 1997 to the present and my 
    opinions of them. You may agree or disagree with my assessments, but 
    I actually had to watch each and every one of them, so these little 
    reviews of the films are based on what I have seen. I hope you enjoy 
    reading my reviews as much as I have had writing them, whether you 
    agree or not. To read what I consider are the good DTV films, Click </FONT><A HREF="#SuckDoesntSuck"><FONT COLOR="BLUE">HERE</FONT></A><FONT COLOR="NAVY">.

     I hope you have a lot of time on your hands, because, for the most 
    part, I break the films down by the year they were made and you will 
    be surprised how many there are out there (and this amounts to about 
    10% of the actual DTV films that are actually in circulation). I'm 
    always adding new films to these pages, so come back often and look 
    for a film you have just seen to see if I write about it here. So sit 
    back, put your reading glasses on and enjoy!</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

    of the perks of moving (which I just recently did) is that cable 
    company Optimum gives you every channel on their lineup for a greatly 
    reduced price for a year (it has since expired, but I still get a 
    great deal). I never subscribed to Showtime or The Movie Channel, so 
    I started watching movies on their stations, as well as on VOD and 
    DVD and Blu-Ray. While most of the horror films they show are 
    run-of-the-mill DTV horror flicks, I must say that I enjoyed a horror 
    comedy called <B><A HREF="suck_2009.htm">SUCK</A></B> (2009) a lot 
    more than I thought I would, especially if you judge it by the title. 
    The story is about a non-label band called <A HREF="suck_2009.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/suck dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="165" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>The
     Winners, headed by Joey (Rob Stefaniuk, who also wrote/directed and 
    penned many of the songs, some which are quite good and also 
    directed/wrote/starred in <B><A HREF="phil_the_alien_2004.htm">PHIL 
    THE ALIEN</A></B> - 2004, another underrated comedy), whose female 
    member, bass player Jennifer (Jessica Pare), is bitten by a vampire 
    and the band suddenly becomes more popular with crowds across Canada 
    and the United States. As the band members are turned into vampires 
    one-by-one, their popularity increases, which begins to disturb Joey, 
    who finally relents and becomes a bloodsucker. The entire band 
    decides that the vampire that bit Jennifer must be destroyed in order 
    for them to become normal again, because they begin killing members 
    of the audiences, groupies and friends for their blood. While the 
    premise may seem old hat, the film is filled with rock star cameos, 
    including Alice Cooper (as a vampire bartender who takes part in a 
    very funny <B><A HREF="crossroads_1986.htm">CROSSROADS</A></B> [1986] 
    parody), Iggy Pop (who is great in his role as&nbsp; small recording 
    studio owner Vincent, who says to Joey, &quot;Let me tell you two 
    things I learned from many, many times being around: Always wear a 
    condom and never trust a goddamn vampire.&quot;), Moby as 
    &quot;Beef&quot; (Who says to Jennifer, &quot;You wanna meet Baby 
    Beef?&quot;, before she bites his dick off), Henry Rollins as 
    ascerbic radio DJ Rockin' Roger (who gets his just desserts live on 
    air when he belittles the members of The Winners) and Dimitri Coats 
    (of the band The Burning Brides, who have a music video on the DVD) 
    as Queenie, the vampire that bit Jennifer. There are also tasty roles 
    for Malcolm McDowell as vampire hunter Eddie Van Helsing (who always 
    carries a flashlight because he's afraid of the dark) and Dave Foley 
    as Jeff, the manager of the band, who will do anything to make sure 
    the band is a success, even covering-up their bloodsucking murders 
    (and taking a beer bottle to his head by Joey's ex-girlfriend, played 
    by&nbsp; Nicole DeBoer of TV's <B><A HREF="dead_zone_tv_series_2002-2007.htm">THE
     DEAD ZONE</A></B> [2002 - 2007] fame). The film is also full of 
    visual tributes to famous album covers, the most obvious being Bruce 
    Springsteen's &quot;Born In The USA&quot; album cover, which here 
    takes place at a U.S. border crossing (where Malcolm McDowell and a 
    U.S. border patrol officer [Alex Lifeson, guitarist for the legendary 
    Canadian rock band Rush] deliver a scathing, yet funny, exchange 
    about lax gun policies in the States). See how many you can spot. It 
    may take more than one viewing. I especially liked Alice Cooper's 
    final bit of dialogue about knowing where to find a new drummer for 
    the band (an old wive's tale about drummers dying first in bands, 
    started by the death of Keith Moon of The Who and parodied in 
    director Rob Reiner's <B><A HREF="this_is_spinal_tap_1984.htm">THIS 
    IS SPINAL TAP</A></B> - 1984). Chris Ratz as Hugo, the band's roadie, 
    really shines here, especially since all he wants to be is a vampire 
    and nobody will turn him. All he does is clean up the band's messes 
    (including hacksawing a convenience store clerk with a straw sticking 
    out of his neck) and takes most of the physical punishment. Add to 
    that some hilarious&nbsp; miniature model work and a flashback by 
    McDowell (actually footage from director Lindsay Anderson's <B><A HREF="o_lucky_man_1973.htm">O'
     LUCKY MAN!</A></B> - 1973) and I would recommend <B><A HREF="suck_2009b.htm">SUCK</A></B> 
    to anyone looking for a good time. Another film I liked was <B><A HREF="deadheads_2011.htm">DEADHEADS</A></B> 
    (2011), a zombie road comedy with some great emotional scenes that 
    hit you in the gut like a sledgehammer to the head. Particularly 
    affecting are the deaths of human Cliff (Harry Burkey, in his first 
    film role) and zombie Cheese (a spot-on performance by Marcus 
    Taylor). The direction/screenplay, by feature film freshmen brothers 
    Brett and Drew T. Pierce (who bill themselves as &quot;The Pierce 
    Brothers&quot;), never takes itself too seriously and they are a team 
    to watch in the future. The lead performances by lovelorn zombie Mike 
    (Michael McKiddy; <B><A HREF="silent_scream_2005.htm">SILENT SCREAM</A></B> 
    - 2005) and new zombie pal Brent (Ross Kidder; <B><A HREF="sam_hell_2008.htm">SAM
     HELL</A></B> - 2008; who, oddly enough, reminds me of a young Dave 
    Foley) are pure joys to watch. Catch it if you can. It's ten times 
    better than AMC's <B><A HREF="walking_dead_tv_series.htm">THE WALKING DEAD</A></B> 
    and is the best zombie comedy since <B><A HREF="shaun_of_the_dead_2003.htm">SHAUN
     OF THE DEAD</A></B> (2003). And if you like your horror more arty, 
    yet creepy as hell, may I recommend <B><A HREF="absentia_2011.htm">ABSENTIA</A></B> 
    (2011)? The premise of the film is a good one: Tricia (Courtney 
    Bell), the pregnant woman of a man missing for seven years finally 
    decides to have him declared dead. Her drug-addicted, yet 
    well-meaning, sister Callie (Katey Parker) comes to help her with the 
    paperwork and help her pack to move. It turns out that Tricia got 
    pregnant from one of the detectives, Ryan Mallory (Dave Levine), who 
    is working on her husband's missing persons case, yet Callie doesn't 
    seem to care. She<A HREF="absentia_2011.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/absentia dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="191" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    seems generally happy that her sister can finally move on. One day 
    while jogging, Callie notices an extremely-thin man lying in the 
    tunnel nearby her sister's house. He tells her his name is Walter 
    Lambert (Doug Jones) and it turns out he has been missing for quite a 
    while, too. It seems the tunnel is some type of gateway to the 
    underworld, where giant silverfish-like creatures (which we barely 
    get to see) kidnap people for some unknown reason. Walter's son, 
    Jamie (James Flanagan), has been leaving the dead carcasses of dogs 
    and other animals (there are missing animal and persons flyers 
    littering the telephone poles and trees throughout town) at the 
    entrance to the tunnel so that the creatures don't eat his father (It 
    doesn't work, as the police find Walter's mangled body at the front 
    of the tunnel). Things turn complicated when Daniel (Morgan Peter 
    Brown), the husband of Tricia, suddenly shows up on the street and 
    his memory seems to have been wiped clean. He mentions the creatures 
    to Callie, but she just thinks he's still trying to cope with reality 
    (something she has a problem with, too). That is until the creatures 
    come to the house and re-kidnap Daniel and she tries to help him 
    without success. The police (including Detective Mallory) puts the 
    blame squarely on Callie, since drugs were found in her bedroom. When 
    the creatures kidnap Tricia, Callie decides to go into the tunnel and 
    trade herself for her sister, but what happens next is best for the 
    viewer to discover. Director/writer Mike Flanagan (<B><A HREF="ghosts_of_hamilton_street_2003.htm">GHOSTS
     OF HAMILTON STREET</A></B> - 2003; <B><A HREF="oculus_2014.htm">OCULUS</A></B>

    - 2016) makes the viewer feel claustrophobic, even when he is filming 
    outdoors. He financed one third of the film's budget ($25,00.00) by

    and the results are nothing but fantastic, even though it was shot on high-definition
     digital video. The final shot will leave you with goosebumps all 
    over your body. Isn't that what a horror film is supposed to do? The 
    acting is way-above average by nearly everyone and they seem like 
    real people, not actors on the screen. It always amazes me what 
    people can do with little money and a lot of imagination. Try it, you 
    may like it. I generally don't care for independent arthouse horror 
    films, but this one really hit a nerve. Here's a partial list of 
    films I have recently watched on DTV that are worth your time: <B><A HREF="murder_of_crows_1998.htm">A
     MURDER OF CROWS</A></B> (1998) is director Rowdy Herrington's (<B><A HREF="road_house_1989.htm">ROAD
     HOUSE</A></B> - 1989; <B><A HREF="striking_distance_1993.htm">STRIKING
     DISTANCE</A></B> - 1993) excellent mystery thriller about a 
    disbarred lawyer (Cuba Gooding Jr.) stealing a dead man's manuscript 
    and submitting it to a publisher under his name, where it becomes a 
    best selling book. The problem is, the book details the murder of 
    five judges and when the judges were murdered the same exact way 
    described in the book, Gooding must stay one step ahead of a 
    detective (Tom Berenger), who believes he is the killer because he 
    wrote the book (See the problem here?), and find the real killer. 
    This film keeps you guessing until the final frame and one wonders 
    why director Herrington hasn't directed more films (there are only 
    eight films in his directorial feature film resume, including his 
    superb debut <B><A HREF="jacks_back_1987.htm">JACK'S BACK</A></B> - 
    1987); <B><A HREF="oxygen_1998.htm">OXYGEN</A></B> (1998) takes that 
    old plot device, where a woman is buried alive and will soon run out 
    of oxygen unless the kidnapper gives out the location, and turns it 
    on its head. In this case, the kidnapper is named Harry (Adrien 
    Brody), after Harry Houdini, and the cop who is interrogating him is 
    Detective Madeline Foster (Maura Tierney), who is a closet masochist 
    (she even hides her prediliction from her cop husband [Terry 
    Kinney]), so she gets off on being verbally and mentally abused 
    during the interrogation. The problem is, will her secret help or 
    hurt the case? Will the woman be found in time? You'll have to view 
    the film to find out, but there is so much more to the story that you 
    will be held spellbound throughout the running time. Director/writer 
    Richard Shepard also handled the same chores on the equally intense <B><A HREF="mercy_1995.htm">MERCY</A></B> 
    (1995) and now directs and produces episodes of TV series; <B><A HREF="safe_house_1998.htm">SAFE
     HOUSE</A></B> (1998) is a fun and exciting thriller about 
    ex-goverment operative Mace Sowell (an excellent Patrick Stewart) who 
    rarely leaves his house (he either suffers from a slight case of 
    agoraphobia or he just doesn't trust anyone on the outside) and runs 
    practice operations with his only friend Stuart Bittenbinder (Craig 
    Shoemaker). Mace is suffering the early effects of Alzheimer's 
    Disease and what he sees as a conspiracy may be all in his mind, so 
    his psychiatrist (Hector Elizondo) and his daughter (Joy Kilpatrick), 
    who doesn't believe he ever worked for the government, hire caretaker 
    Andi Travers (Kimberly Williams) to cook, clean and take care of him 
    (The interview process with some of the other people being considered 
    for the job is priceless comedy). At first, she thinks Mace is losing 
    his mind (even beating the crap out of Stuart when she doesn't 
    realize that he and Mace are simply running &quot;drills&quot;), but 
    a third act reveal will surprise the hell out of you. To say anymore 
    would be to deprive you of a gem of a film with plenty of humor and 
    action. Look for a nod towards <B><A HREF="3_days_of_the_condor_1975.htm">3
     DAYS OF THE CONDOR</A></B> (1975) involving a deadly mailman played

    Nesher's <B><A HREF="mercenary_1996.htm">MERCENARY</A></B> (1996),

    - 1996). Mercenary Captain Hawk May (Olivier Gruner. the only 
    returning cast member) teams up with fellow mercenaries Ray Domino 
    (Nicholas Turturro) and Sam (Sam Bottoms) to retrieve kidnapped 
    accountant Charlie Love (Robert Townsend) for rich bitch Patricia Van 
    Lier (Claudia Christian, who has never looked more fetching). 
    Townsend and Gruner make a funny pair (some of their back-and-forth 
    dialogue is hilarious) and the action comes fast and furious. Not a 
    bad little time-waster; <B><A HREF="restraining_order_1999.htm">RESTRAINING
     ORDER</A></B> (1999) concerns criminal defense lawyer Robert 
    Woodfield (the always intense Eric Roberts), who believes his 
    clients, whether innocent or guilty, deserve a good lawyer on their 
    side. His latest client is Martin Ritter (Hannes Jaenicke), a 
    murderer who Robert manages to get a not guilty verdict in court. 
    When a friend calls Robert and tells him he has something important 
    to tell him, he witnesses Martin kill him, but since he is still his 
    lawyer, he can't go to the cops. Martin is out to kill him and frames 
    Robert's wife, Leight (Tatjana Patitz), for his friend's murder. 
    Robert and his wife must now avoid the police and Martin and his gang 
    while trying to uncover the secret his friend was going to tell him 
    before he was killed. This is a good action/mystery directed by Lee 
    H. Katzin (<B><A HREF="world_gone_wild_1988.htm">WORLD GONE WILD</A></B>

    concerns a childless couple (Jennifer Tilly, Vincent Gallo) 
    kidnapping a pregnant woman (Daryl Hannah), after setting up an 
    accident which makes her look dead to her husband (Bruce Greenwood) 
    and the police, and waiting to deliver the child in a snowy farmhouse 
    in the middle of nowhere. If you are wondering why there is very 
    little scenery in this film, it's because Jennifer Tilly chewed on it 
    all. She gives one of the most bat-shit crazy performances of her 
    career (think about that for a minute) and her performance will have 
    you doing many double-takes. Directed by Sidney J. Furie (<B><A HREF="action.htm#Hollow Point">HOLLOW
     POINT</A></B> - 1995), who is still working today, even though he is 
    nearly 80 years-old. He must have had tons of fun with Tilly; <B><A HREF="let_the_devil_wear_black_1999.htm">LET
     THE DEVIL WEAR BLACK</A></B> (1999) is a good little Shakespearian 
    thriller that goes to dark places usually not found in DTV films like 
    this. A 19 year-old college student (Jonathan Penner) believes the 
    murder of his wealthy father (Chris Sarandon) may have been committed 
    by his mother (Jaqueline Bisset) and Uncle (Jamie Sheridan), who 
    announce their wedding a mere few weeks after his father's death. 
    There are a few surprises you don't see coming and this has a great 
    cast for a DTV flick, including Philip Baker Hall, Mary Louise 
    Parker, Jonathan Banks, Maury Chaykin and Norman Reedus (<B><A HREF="walking_dead_tv_series.htm">THE
     WALKING DEAD</A></B> - 2010-Present). If there is one problem I have 
    with this film, it's that Jonathan Penner was way too old to play a 
    college student (he was 37 at the time). Maybe that's because he co-wrote
     the screenplay with director Stacy Title, who also happens to be his 
    real-life wife; <B><A HREF="raw_nerve_1999.htm">RAW NERVE</A></B> 
    (1999) is an above-average crime thriller from the always interesting

    with best friend (and ex-cop) Zach Galligan and girlfriend Nicollette 
    Sheridan, must run away when the secret raises it's ugly head. To say 
    any more would be to deprive you of an unique thriller with one hell 
    of a third act. Catch it; <B><A HREF="clean_and_narrow_1999.htm">THE 
    CLEAN AND NARROW</A></B> (1999) is the directorial debut of actor 
    William Katt (<B><A HREF="snake_island_2002.htm">SNAKE ISLAND</A></B> 
    - 2002) and I'm happy to say it's a good little crime thriller with a 
    heavy emotional core. The underrated Jack Noseworthy (whose 
    helmetless scene in outer space in <B><A HREF="event_horizon_1997.htm">EVENT
     HORIZON</A></B> [1997] still makes me cringe) stars as ex-con Buddy, 
    who promises to go the straight and narrow to girlfriend Marie (Laura 
    Leighton) and take care of her retarded brother, Fergouson (a winning 
    performance by Wes Culwell). After trying to get a job, live the 
    clean life and having no success, Buddy agrees to rob a liquor store 
    with two childhood friends. When one of the friends kills the liquor 
    store clerk, everything goes to hell. There are also meaty roles for 
    Wings Hauser and Sandra Locke as the Sheriff and his wife, who 
    recently lost their child. There's not many DTV crime thrillers that 
    make you care about all the characters (both good and bad) and their 
    fates. This is one of them; <B><A HREF="forgotten_city_1999.htm">FORGOTTEN
     CITY</A></B> (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="vivero_letter_1999.htm">THE VIVERO LETTER</A></B> 
    - 1999) is one of those films that you'll either love or hate. If you 
    use your brain, you'll spot plot holes galore (thanks to 
    screenwriters Denne Bart Petitclerc [<B><A HREF="red_sun_1971.htm">RED
     SUN</A></B> - 1971] and Arthur Sellers [<B><A HREF="modern_problems_1981.htm">MODERN
     PROBLEMS</A></B> - 1981]), but if you like mindless entertainment, 
    this adventure film may do the trick. James Wheeler (Robert Patrick) 
    gets a call from his brother in Central America and asks him to 
    travel there with a Mayan plate that belonged to his grandmother. 
    James arrives with the plate in Central America, only to discover 
    that his brother has been murdered and he also has a target on his 
    back from the same people who killed his brother. His life is saved 
    by Caterina (Chiara Caselli), who tells James that the plate is one 
    of two which, when combined, is a map to a secret ancient city in the 
    jungle that is full of treasure. The owner of the second plate, 
    Andrew Fallon (Fred Ward), agrees to finance the trip through the 
    jungle to find the city. Expect plenty of double crosses, venemous 
    snakes, a tribe of mud-caked jungle warriors and puzzles that have to 
    be solved before the city can be found. Director H. Gordon Boos (<B><A HREF="red_surf_1989.htm">RED
     SURF</A></B> - 1989; He passed away in 2004) offers plenty of action 
    as long as you put your brain in neutral; <B><A HREF="eye_see_you_1999-2002.htm">EYE
     SEE YOU</A></B> (1999) turned out to be star Sylvester Stallone's 
    first DTV film, but I think it gets a much worse reputation than it 
    deserves. Filmed as <B><A HREF="d_tox_1999-2002.htm">D-TOX</A></B> in 
    1999 and not released on DVD until 2002, this crime mystery finds cop 
    Stallone hitting the bottle badly when a serial killer (who tattooes 
    &quot;Eye See U&quot; under the eyelids of his victims) he is chasing 
    gruesomely murders his pregnant girlfriend whom he was just about to 
    ask to marry him. Stallone ends up in a treatment center in the 
    middle of the cold nowhere, where cops and other law enforcement 
    officers are there to be treated by doctor Kris Kristofferson and his 
    unproven and experimental ways. After making them give up all their 
    weapons (and eventually their belts), we are introduced to the motley 
    group of law enforcement gone wrong, including a guy who shot himself 
    in the face and survived, another who is dealing with the death of 
    his partner, a severely depressed old cop who finds life not worth 
    living anymore and so on.&nbsp; As the cops are starting to get 
    knocked-off one-by-one, it becomes apparent that the serial killer 
    has followed Stallone to the secluded treatment facility and has 
    taken the identity of one of the troubled cops. It is up to Stallone 
    to try and figure out who it is and get revenge at the same time, 
    which he does in a particularly gory finale. Director Jim Gillespie (<B><A HREF="i_know_what_you_did_last_summer_1997.htm">I

    cold while watching this film because if its Wintery setting. I've 
    seen a lot, lot worse than this and thought it should have gotten at 
    least a token theatrical release. But what do I know? It only 
    co-stars Charles S. Dutton; Robert Patrick; Jeffrey Wright; Tom 
    Berenger; Polly Walker; Christopher Fulford; Frank Pelligrino; Robert

    a remake of the 1995 <A HREF="from_dusk_till_dawn_1995.htm">original film</A> 
    than the <A HREF="horror d - i.htm#From Dusk 2">first sequel</A>, but 
    this one takes place during the late 1800's in Mexico. A band of 
    outlaws, a trio of stagecoach passengers (including Michael Parks as 
    Ambrose Bierce [Google the name.]) and a posse looking for the 
    outlaws end up at what will become the Titty Twister bar and must 
    band together to fight the vampires, led by madame Sonia Braga and 
    Satanico Pandemonium. Like the original, it takes some time to get to 
    the vampire angle, but once it does, it is non-stop blood and gore 
    (including beheadings, impalements and a vampire's testicles on an 
    outlaw's boot knife!). Some versions of this film have an extra funny 
    bit after the end credits featuring Michael Parks and director P.J.

    (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="last_warrior_2000.htm">THE LAST WARRIOR</A></B> - 
    2000) is a departure from most Dolph Lundgren action films because 
    it's a post-apocalyptic thriller and contains a lot of comedy (and is 
    also rated PG-13). A worldwide earthquake has reformatted the Earth 
    and California is now just an island. Lundgren and a band of misfits 
    must defeat a sadistic dictator who controls a prison-like fort and 
    free all the prisoners (including women and children) in order to get 
    humanity back on track again. Plenty of action and comedy follow. 
    Just unusual enough to merit a viewing or two; <B><A HREF="operative_2000.htm">THE
     OPERATIVE</A></B> (2000) is Brian Bosworth's best film since <B><A HREF="stone_cold_1990.htm">STONE

    escapes from a Russian gulag after spending over 11 years there. He 
    disguises himself as a Texas oil man when back in the United States 
    to stay clear of the C.I.A. and the Russians, but he gets himself 
    into all types of hand-to-hand combat and gunfights. It's not boring 
    for a second, yet the Boz has all but disappeared from screens, 
    taking secondary roles in films (Adam Sandler's <B><A HREF="longest_yard_2005.htm">THE

    inventive futuristic sci-fi tale (even though the Twin Towers can be 
    seen in the New York skyline) where instead of flying to another 
    country or city, you use technology called XChange to swap minds with 
    a person in the other location. When a corporate slacker (Kim Coates) 
    swaps his mind with a violent terrorist (Kyle MacLachlan), he 
    transfers his mind into a clone (the always dour Stephen Baldwin), 
    who only has a two-day life span, to bring the terrorist down and 
    regain the use of his own body. It's inventive and, for once, the 
    promotional material that calls this film a cross between John Woo's <B><A HREF="face_off_1997.htm">FACE/OFF</A></B>

    Wiper stars as Boomer, a Chicago cop who&nbsp; quits the force when 
    he watches his partner (Carmen Argenziano) die. He travels to Cedar 
    Falls to be with his true love (Natasha Henstridge), who left Chicago 
    because she couldn't take Boomer's job, but is carjacked along the

    everything turns to shit when a series of events mistakens Boomer as 
    a mob guy wanted by the big bosses and he must find a way to survive 
    and make it to Cedar Falls. Filled with gunfights, a twist or two and 
    good acting by a bunch of pros, including Andre Braugher, Lou Diamond 
    Phillips and Joe Pantoliano. You could do a whole lot worse than this 
    film (and I have!); <B><A HREF="chasing_sleep_2000.htm">CHASING SLEEP</A></B> 
    (2000) is a good psychological thriller about a sleep deprived 
    English college professor (Jeff Daniels) whose teacher wife (Molly 
    Price) just went missing. Daniels takes pills to try to sleep 
    (everyone in this film takes pills of one kind or another) and we are 
    left to determine if what he is experiencing is real or imaginary. 
    The facts are this: His wife is pregnant (Daniels hasn't had sex with 
    her in months) and she was having an affair with Phys Ed teacher 
    George (Julian McMahon), at least according to the detective (Gil 
    Bellows) who takes his missing persons report and tells him her car 
    was found running near George's house. The bathroom, the pipes in the 
    basement, a female student who loves him (Emily Bergl), a malformed 
    giant baby in the bathtub and an arguing couple in the house next 
    door are major clues of what really took place. You just have to use 
    your deducing skills to determine what really happened to his wife. 
    Daniels never leaves his house in this film and is always barefoot, 
    but when he peeks outside his window to spy at his bickering 
    next-door neighbors, you should really be on your toes to look very 
    closely. I love films that make you<A HREF="specials_2000.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/specials dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="216" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>

    (2001) is a comedy/action film starring the late Leslie Nielsen, but 
    those expecting a kitchen sink comedy ala <B><A HREF="naked_gun_1988.htm">THE
     NAKED GUN</A></B> (1988) are bound to be disappointed. Nielsen is 
    grizzled private dick Jack Potter, who reluctantly takes novice Marty 
    Mackenzie (Lochlyn Munro) under his wing when he has to investigate a 
    possible murder case in the small town of Beaver Ridge, Oregon. They 
    meet an assortment of odd characters including the Sheriff (William 
    Forsythe), who has a thing for sex toys. The comedy is played 
    straight this time and there is a quite coherent mystery plot. That 
    could be due to the film <!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/firetrap dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="217" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0">being
     directed by James Keach and co-written by Billy Bob Thorton (using 
    the pseudonym &quot;Reginald Perry&quot;). Not bad and very funny in 
    spots (watch the &quot;lounge singer&quot; scene); <B><A HREF="stiletto_dance_2001.htm">STILETTO
     DANCE</A></B> (2001). Eric Roberts appeared in more than his share 
    of DTV clunkers during the 90's and early-00's (like the terrible <B><A HREF="die_hard_1988.htm">DIE
     HARD</A></B> rip-off, <B><A HREF="alternative_2000.htm">THE ALTERNATE</A></B> 
    - 2000), but this is not one of them. Maybe it's because he had a 
    good director (Mario Azzopardi; <B><A HREF="deadline_1981.htm">DEADLINE</A></B> 
    - 1981), but I always considered Eric the more talented of the 
    Roberts family (Julia Roberts is waaaaay overrated and Eric's 
    daughter, Emma Roberts [<B><A HREF="scream_4_2011.htm">SCREAM 4</A></B> 
    - 2011], is just getting her acting chops). He has an intensity that 
    shines though even in the crap films he has appeared in, but this 
    film is an involving action thriller about an undercover cop 
    (Roberts) infiltrating the Russian mob in Albany and falling in love 
    with the mob boss' wife, while the mob boss is trying to sell a 
    nuclear device to the Albanians. Good action, above-average acting 
    from everyone involved and tension you can cut with a knife make this 
    a perfect rainy day movie; <B><A HREF="firetrap_2001.htm">FIRETRAP</A></B> 
    (2001) is a fun little action flick with DNA of <B><A HREF="die_hard_1988.htm">DIE
     HARD</A></B> (1988) and <B><A HREF="towering_inferno_1974.htm">THE 
    TOWERING INFERNO</A></B> (1974) in its veins. Dean Cain portrays a 
    recently-released-from-prison con who happens to be a master thief. 
    In order to win back his wife, he takes a job robbing a valuable 
    computer chip in a highrise building. He goes into the building 
    dressed as a cop, but before he can steal the chip, a fire breaks out 
    and everyone looks to him for help thinking he is an actual cop. 
    What's a thief with a conscience to do? He helps the trapped people 
    while still trying to steal the chip, but soon discovers the fire was 
    set purposely and the arsonist is one of the people he is trying to 
    save. Lots of action, stunts and not one &quot;borrowed&quot; scene 
    from an A-list film, like most DTV action films at the time. This was 
    also one of PM Entertainment's last film releases; <B><A HREF="fangs_2001.htm">FANGS</A></B> 
    (2001). Call me an old softie, but I liked this DTV flick about 
    genetically altered murderous (and intelligent) bats escaping and 
    killing people in the town of Scottsville, California. Big town cop 
    (Tracy Nelson, who is miscast), transferred to this sleeply little 
    town, teams up with an animal control officer (Whip Hubley) to 
    invesitgate the killings, which pisses off the town sheriff (Michael 
    Gregory), a scientist (Mark Taylor) and a local real estate agent 
    (Corbin Bernsen), all who are hiding deadly secrets. The way the two 
    heroes &quot;jam&quot; the bats' radar is pretty ingenious and there 
    is also some comedy to be had (Screenwriter Jim Geoghan is mainly 
    known for writing comedy scripts for some of the best known comedy TV 
    series from the 1980's till today). The film doesn't take itself too 
    seriously, which is a good thing, because if it was played straight 
    like the Lou Diamond Phillips-starrer <B><A HREF="bats_1999.htm">BATS</A></B> 
    (1999), it would be a lousy film. Director Kelly Sandefur also made 
    the underrated <B><A HREF="inhabited_2002.htm">INHABITED</A></B> 
    (2002); <B><A HREF="dead_awake_2001.htm">DEAD AWAKE</A></B> (2001) is 
    one of Stephen Baldwin's best films, because it incorporates his 
    morose acting style into the script. Baldwin is Desmond Caine, who 
    has a case of insomnia so bad, he hasn't had a decent night's sleep 
    in over ten months. He spends his nights walking the streets and 
    spending time at a diner populated by an assortment of odd characters 
    (including Michael Ironside). One night, on one of his midnight 
    walks, he witnesses a murder (which he doesn't know is real or an 
    insomnia-induced dream), which leads to a series of surreal events 
    culminating in the previously-mentioned diner. The film, directed by 
    Marc S. Grenier (<B><A HREF="red_rover_2003.htm">RED ROVER</A></B> - 
    2003; starring Stephen Baldwin's brother, William), manages to hold 
    your attention throughout, mainly because the characters are so 
    interesting. One of the better Canadian thrillers of the early 
    Millennium; <B><A HREF="american_psycho_2_2002.htm">AMERICAN PSYCHO 2</A></B> 
    (2001), an in-name only sequel to <B><A HREF="american_psycho_2000.htm">AMERICAN
     PSYCHO</A></B> (2000; although Patrick Bateman is name-checked a 
    couple of times), is a serio-comic thriller about a female serial 
    killer (the talented Mila Kunis, who got her start in films like the 
    1995 remake of <B><A HREF="piranha_1995.htm">PIRANHA</A></B> and 
    became famous on the TV series <B><A HREF="that_70s_show_tv_series_1998-2006.htm">THAT
     70'S SHOW</A></B> [1998 - 2006]), who kills an incoming freshman 
    college student and takes her identity, in hopes of becoming the 
    teacher's assistant to Starkman (a subdued William Shatner), a 
    professor who is an expert on serial killers. As a matter of fact, 
    she will kill anyone who gets in her way. When her psychiatrist 
    (Geraint Wyn Davies) calls his good friend Starkman and tells him 
    that one of his students is a psychopath (without breaking his 
    client-doctor confidentiality), Starkman thinks it is a female 
    student he is having a sexual affair with. This all leads to a series 
    of close calls, but Kunis proves to be too smart for everybody. This 
    is a fun little flick (the gore is minimal, but it is not needed 
    here) and one can see that Mila Kunis was someone to watch in the 
    future; <B><A HREF="epoch_2001.htm">EPOCH</A></B> (2001) is an 
    effective little sci-fi flick with religious overtones. A giant 
    300-story spinning rock-like monolith appears floating just above the 
    ground, creating all sorts of natural disasters, including massive 
    earthquakes, tidal waves and torrential rain. A weapons specialist 
    (David Keith) is called-in to lead a group of scientists and soldiers 
    to enter the monolith and find out whether it is alien in origin, the 
    source of all human life or maybe even God itself. Although we never 
    really discover the truth, it opens the door to make the viewer 
    actually think that if there is actually a higher power, does 
    religion have to be part of the equation? Pretty thought-provoking, 
    although the sequel, <B><A HREF="epoch_evolution_2003.htm">EPOCH: EVOLUTION</A></B> 
    (2003), was totally unneeded; <B><A HREF="breed_2001.htm">THE BREED</A></B> 
    (2001) is a good little vampire detective tale from director Michael 
    Oblowitz (who went on to direct a few Steven Seagal DTV flicks). 
    Bookeem Woodbine stars as Steve Grant, a police detective who 
    witnesses his partner being brutally murdered by some inhuman 
    creature. He is then partnered with Aaron Gray (Adrian Paul), just as 
    the world is made aware that peaceful vampires have been living 
    amongst us for centuries (It turns out that 20% of humans are 
    incapable of being turned into vampires). Gray just happens to be a 
    vampire and Grant learns that his former partner was murdered by a 
    vampire who believes that humans should be used for food. Grant and 
    Gray butt heads often because Grant hates vampires, but he slowly 
    changes his mind when he begins to fall in love with vampire Lucy 
    (Bai Ling), which leads to a lot of complications. This is a good 
    little horror action thriller with an ending that will pull at your 
    heart (It turns out that Grant is one of the 20%). Not bad for what 
    it is; <B><A HREF="gristle_2001.htm">THE GRISTLE</A></B> (2001) is a 
    pretty good crime thriller (the first film mostly financed by the 
    Small Business Administration Guaranteed Loan Program) directed by 
    freshman David Portlock (who hasn't directed anything since) that has 
    some incisive things to say about race relations while giving us some 
    great laugh-out-loud dialogue. Since no one is credited as the 
    screenwriter, my best guess is that Portland is the author. The story 
    is about four groups of two guys of varying races who are trying to 
    get rid of stolen goods and the comical, yet dangerous, situations 
    they find themselves in. Michael Dorn is a standout here and will 
    make you forget he played Lt. Commander Worf on <B><A HREF="star_trek_the_next_ generation_tv_series_1987-1994.htm">STAR
     TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION</A></B> (1987 - 1994) as he spits out such 
    dialogue as &quot;Is there a man sitting on the toilet taking a shit 
    in the back of your mouth?&quot; when complaining about a guy's bad 
    breath. There's also a great cast of character actors here, including 
    Barry Corbin, Orson Bean, Richard Riehle and Sven-Ole Thorsen. Those 
    looking for extreme violence and bloodshed are going to be 
    disappointed, but those who like satire to go along with their crime 
    dramas will get a kick out of this film. David Portlock, where are 
    you?; <B><A HREF="scenes_of_the_crime_2001.htm">SCENES OF THE CRIME</A></B> 
    (2001) is an involving thriller, even though most of the action takes 
    place in a van. Mob wannabe Lenny (Jon Abrahams) is making what he 
    thinks is just another delivery when the shit hits the fan and he 
    finds his boss's rival Jimmy Berg (Jeff Bridges) in the back of his 
    van. With Jimmy's colleagues surrounding the van and a nearby deli, 
    Jimmy calls his boss to find out what to do (Turns out Jimmy owes 
    Lenny's boss seven million dollars and he orders Lenny to hold him 
    prisoner no matter what happens). What does happen next is best for 
    you to discover, but the excellent cast, including Morris Chestnut, 
    R. Lee Ermey, M&auml;dchen Amick, Henry Rollins, Bob Gunton, Dominic 
    Purcell and especially Noah Wyle (TNT's <B><A HREF="falling_skies_tv_series_2011.htm">FALLING
     SKIES</A></B> - 2011-2015), as you have never seen him before, make 
    this a crime drama worth searching out with a surprise finale that 
    fits the film perfectly; <B><A HREF="spiders_2_2001.htm">SPIDERS 2</A></B> 
    (2001) may not be as hectic as director Gary Jones' <B><A HREF="spiders_2000.htm">SPIDERS</A></B> 
    (2000), but director Sam Firstenberg (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#AvengingForce">AVENGING
     FORCE</A></B> - 1986) and star Richard Moll both make this film a 
    bat-shit crazy movie. A couple lose their yacht during a storm and 
    think they are lucky when they are picked up by a commercial carrier 
    captained by Jim Bigelow (Daniel Quinn). What they don't count on are 
    the crazy antics of Dr. Grbac (Moll), who injects people with a 
    paralytic agent so they can be fed&nbsp; to his giant spiders (after 
    the spiders wrap them in webs) in the hull of the ship (The bodies 
    are also used as incubators for the giant spiders' babies). Sure, 
    some of the spider CGI is dodgy, but there is enough gore and scenery 
    chewing by Moll to satisfy any horror film fan. I liked it; <B><A HREF="order_2001.htm">THE
     ORDER</A></B> (2001) is one of Jean-Claude Van Damme's first DTV 
    films and it's pretty good. Artifact smuggler Van Damme travels to 
    Israel to rescue his archaeologist father (Charlton Heston in his 
    last live-action film) and retrieve an ancient scroll that could 
    start a holy war. He is framed for murder by crooked Major Ner (Ben 
    Cross) and must avoid the police while fighting his way to rescue his 
    father and find the scroll. Lots of Van Damme's patented martial arts 
    action, with a dab of gore and mysticism. Not bad. Van Damme's DTV 
    films are usually always better than Steven Seagal's or Dolph 
    Lundgren's because Van Damme has become a pretty good actor as well 
    as an action star; <B><A HREF="series_7_the_contenders_2001.htm">SERIES

    as you will see, gets a lot of love in this section) and his gang who 
    use extreme sports to pull off heists. They plan on committing six 
    heists, but when their second heist surprisingly nets them 20 million 
    dollars in untraceable bonds, they decide to call it quits. 
    Unfortunately, crooked cop Bruce Payne has other plans for Dorff and 
    his gang and wants them to commit more thefts. Natasha Henstridge is 
    the FBI agent out to catch them. Full of amazing stunts (check out 
    the rollerblade chase), this film will entertain you for the full

    of his markers will tear them up if he teaches a man (Jason Bateman) 
    how to kill his wife (Guylaine St-Onge) without getting caught (in 
    other words, the perfect murder). Thriller fans will love the twists 
    and turns this films takes, as Belushi's female cop partner (Angela 
    Featherstone) knows something is up and tries to get to the bottom of 
    it while trying to save Belushi's life. Belushi can act up a storm

     OF ORIGIN</A></B> (2002) is a thriller based on a true story that 
    was originally shown on HBO. Someone is setting a bunch of homicidal 
    fires in southern California and ace arson investigator John Orr (an 
    excellent Ray Liotta) and his partner Keith Lang (John Leguizamo) are 
    in charge of investigating them. Orr has the uncanny ability to find 
    the point of origin of all these fires, which leads his partner and 
    the Fire Department to suspect that Orr may be the arsonist. As the 
    film progresses, we see that Orr is leading a double life, writing a 
    book about an arsonist based on the fires he started and soon he 
    begins to blur the line between reality and fantasy (there's a <B><A HREF="matrix_1999.htm">MATRIX</A></B>-style

    the film). In real life, Orr published his book (titled &quot;Points 
    of Origin: Playing with Fire&quot;), which law enforcement says 
    contains facts that only the arsonist would know. Liotta plays Orr as 
    a real heel, cheating on his wife with a female fire investigator, 
    which makes the film fascinating to watch. The fire scenes are also 
    done with flair (a stuntman was burnt over 40 percent of his body 
    during one fire scene in an unfortunate accident) and the entire film

    mob boss. He joins the Federal Witness Program under a new name and

    two-and-two together and figure out who Assante really is, they 
    contact the mob in hope of collecting the hit bounty. What follows

    who killed the actual head lighthouse guard (and author on

    mysteriously overtake a German trench, even though they are vastly

    only good Germans are dead Germans, so he guns them down, all except 
    for one, Friedrich (Torben Liebrecht), which the squad plans to 
    question. Bell is the green soldier in the squad and doesn't agree 
    with the way Serkis and other members of the squad are treating 
    Friedrich, torturing him and beating him up (They don't speak German 
    and Friedrich doesn't speak English), but Bell speaks French and so 
    does Friedrich. He tells Bell that something evil is in the trench 
    with them, but other members of the squad think he is lying. Bell 
    doesn't, of course, as he has felt a presence ever since he set foot 
    in the trench. Soon, members of the squad begin dying in the most 
    gruesome manner, as bodies of the dead seemingly rise to life covered 
    in barb wire and dish out punishment to the British. But what is this 
    &quot;presence&quot;? You'll have to watch the film to find out, as 
    well as discovering who lives and who dies (The ending of this film 
    reminded me of the finale of the original <B><A HREF="saw_2004.htm">SAW</A></B>

    atmosphere, as it never stops raining (this had to be a real chore 
    for all the actors involved), making everyone in the squad 
    extra-miserable and maybe making them more violent than usual (except 
    for Serkis, who is one mean bastard here). The effects are fantastic 
    (especially the discovery of what rats did to an injured British 
    soldier's legs), as is the sound design (the &quot;presence&quot; 
    interacts with every speaker on your 5.1 Dolby receiver!), making 
    this a film well-worth searching out, especially if you like to be

    A meteorite shower hits the tiny fishing village of Berkeley, turning 
    some of the citizens into flesh-eating zombies. While the residents 
    try to kill all the infected, the town is visited by a circular alien 
    spaceship who try to cure the town of the infection by transporting 
    the uninfected into to atmosphere by a light ray (it is quite the 
    sight). At first the residents of Berkeley think the aliens are part 
    of the problem, but soon they discover that they are their saviors. 
    When the aliens think they have obliterated the disease from the 
    town, they leave in their spaceship, not knowing a plane pilot who is 
    infected is still flying in the sky. He parachutes back into town and 
    begins the infection all over again with the aliens not knowing that 
    it is active once again. The film is funny in parts without being the 
    winking and knowing kind found in some horror films (what one of the 
    aliens says to another at the end of the film is very funny) and some 
    of the special effects and zombie kills are well done. Rene (Felicity 
    Mason) is the film's heroine, but she could not have done any of it 
    without the aliens' help, but at the finale, it is up to her to make 
    sure the disease doesn't spread outside of Berkeley, showing her on 
    the farm she was going to lose in the beginning of the film is now a 
    pen for all the town's zombies and she stands guard over them, hoping

    discovering an ancient secret in his town that goes back to when the 
    Seminole Indians owned the land: There's a tree-like monster in the 
    swamps that kills people based on their worst fears. Good CGI, some 
    great gore (unusual for a Marvel film) and some pretty damned good

    the comic book. Those who did have torn this film to pieces; <B><A HREF="prophecy_uprising_2004.htm">THE
     PROPHECY: UPRISING</A></B> (2004) is genre producer Joel Soisson's 
    directorial debut and for the third of four sequels to <B><A HREF="prophecy_1995.htm">THE
     PROPHECY</A></B> (1995; and one of the best horror films of the 
    90's), it is a pretty good film despite the fact that Christopher 
    Walken turned down doing any more sequels after the third film. This 
    one is about good angel John Riegert (John Light) jouning forces with 
    Budapest, Romania detective Dani Simionescu (an excellent Sean 
    Pertwee) to protect a church secretary named Allison (Kari Wuhrer) 
    from a demon angel, who travels from body to body when killed, to get 
    his hands on an ancient Bible in Allison's possession. There is a 
    backstory about Allison and Dani's childhood and we are not sure if 
    John is on God's side or on his own. The Bible contains powers which 
    will bring all the Devil's angels to Earth, but Dani comes up with a 
    good way to get the invisible demon angel (who possesses the body of 
    his partner, played by Doug Bradley) not to possess any more bodies.

     PROPHECY: FORSAKEN</B></A> (2004, made back-to-back with this film

    worth a watch.; <B><A HREF="new_police_story_2004.htm">NEW POLICE STORY</A></B> 
    (2004) is an exciting action film starring Jackie Chan (the only 
    actor to appear in all seven films of the series, even if this one 
    has little to do with the other six, the last one {at the time of 
    this writing} being <B><A HREF="police_story_2013_2013.htm">POLICE

     STORY: LOCKDOWN</A></B> - 2013). Jackie portrays Inspector Chan, who 
    watches as all nine of his squad are killed by a bunch of teenagers 
    in masks (this scene is one of the best of Jackie's career), the 
    leader of the criminal group is actually the Police Chief's son! The 
    criminals are playing a computer game where players are awarded 
    points for how many policemen and policewomen they kill, only they 
    decide to make the game real (The Chief's son was physically abused 
    by his father as a young boy, leading to his hatred of all police). 
    After losing his team, Inspector Chan becomes an outcast from the 
    police force, along with becoming a raging alcoholic. It takes a 
    young detective with a coat two sizes bigger than him (You will find 
    out why) to get Inspector Chan back in the game (pun intentional) 
    and, together, they try to take down the gang. This is full of 
    amazing stunts (as with most of Jackie's films, they show all the 
    mistakes during the final credits), all performed by Jackie himself 
    (there is a car scene that will make you rewind the DVD or Blu-Ray to 
    see if what you saw actually happened) and director/producer Bennie 
    Chan (<B><A HREF="who_am_i_1998.htm">WHO AM I?</A></B> - 1998; also 
    starring Chan) fills the screen with huge explosions, car chases, gun 
    fights and, especially, fantastic martial arts fights. Jackie may be 
    getting older, but he still has the chops to do things that most 
    people would never do in a million years. This film also has an 
    emotional core that you will not find in most American-made action 
    films, which gives this film an extra layer. See it if you can.;&nbsp;

     OF THE VAMPIRE</A></B> (2000; Willem Dafoe, in a performance that 
    defies description, was nominated for an Academy Award, but didn't 
    win). What audiences missed was one of the best, symbolic-driven 
    thrillers of 2004. FBI agents Aaron Eckhart and Carrie-Anne Moss are 
    investigating a case where a serial killer is killing only other 
    serial killers. Eckhart is determined to get the FBI to believe that 
    the killer is one of their own, a product of a top secret experiment 
    in the 60's where people with telepathic powers, called &quot;remote 
    viewers&quot;, were brought in and were able to pinpoint locations of 
    terrorists and other bad people using nothing but their minds 
    (Remember, this was during the Cold War). The project was abandoned 
    and so were the people involved (thrown away like garbage) and the 
    only one still alive is Benjamin O'Riley (Ben Kingsley, in an Oscar <A HREF="it_waits_2005.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/it waits dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>worthy

    uses his powers to murder serial killers to alieve some of his pain. 
    He also knows the exact way he is going to die, which plays an 
    important part of the plot. Of course, the FBI think Eckhard is nuts 
    and don't believe a word he says, so he goes about proving it on his 
    own. Involving every step of the way, this film should not be missed 
    by people who are thriller fans and excited by symbolism in their 
    films. I loved it. Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, this 
    is Merhige's last theatrical film. Why?; <B><A HREF="it_waits_2005.htm">IT

    the guilt of killing her best friend in a drunk driving accident, so 
    she takes a job alone manning an an oversight tower deep in the 
    forest just to stay away from people. Unfortunately, some explorers 
    have unleashed a monster from a cave where it has spent thousands of 
    years in seclusion, thanks to a Native American curse. As the bodies

    with one of the sorority girls. A series of circumstances happens 
    where he is trapped in a closet watching one of the sorority girls 
    making love and then it happens: Tenticles spring out of her breasts 
    and stomach and the male she is with ends up frozen like a popsicle. 
    It's not long before more males start showing up frozen stiffer than 
    an uncooked fish stick and Luke must try to convince the authorities 
    that some of the sorority girls are actually aliens. The cops think 
    he is nuts, so he and female friend Constance (Kim Poirier) look for 
    a way to stop these frozen females. Maybe fire will work? Maybe even 
    a flame thrower? Since nudity plays an important point in the plot, 
    stay away from the Sci Fi Channel version (they optically fog out the

    a policeman and a forensics expert, both who still believe he is 
    guilty of those murders, cannot accuse him of a new series of murders 
    happening in Belfast. The problem is, someone is fucking around with 
    the timecodes on his tapes and others are missing, making it look

    more could you ask for? How about a killer exit song titled 
    &quot;After All&quot; by Somnium that will leave you humming it for 
    days afterward. The song's so good, when I couldn't find a copy of it

     THE SUN</A></B> (2004) is one of Steven Seagal's better early DTV 
    films, probably due to the fact that it takes place in Japan, a

    his history). When the Tokyo governor is murdered, Seagal is called

    claims that this is a remake of <B><A HREF="yakuza_1974.htm">THE YAKUZA</A></B>

    film is like a video game, as Seagal and his cohorts must fight a 
    series of increasingly difficult fighters using a variety of weapons. 
    For once, it looks like Seagal did most of his stunts (especially the 
    swordplay, of which he is an expert) and it is bloody as hell (Shit, 
    the whole film just flows with the red stuff). This is one early 
    Seagal DTV flick where you won't be watching the clock waiting for it

    entertaining detective mystery. Daniel Baldwin and Sam Trammell (<B><A HREF="true_blood_cable_series.htm">TRUE

    dash of <B><A HREF="rear_window_1954.htm">REAR WINDOW</A></B> (1954) 
    thrown in for good measure. A wheelchair bound man (Matt McCoy) is 
    brought to a secluded group of cabins in the woods to recuperate from 
    a mountain climbing accident. He spies with binoculars on the girls 
    who rented the cabin next door and sees Bigfoot kill one of them and 
    tries to convince his caregiver what he saw. The caregiver instead 
    tries to drug him, only to have the caregiver get killed by Bigfoot 
    (once you see the way he dies, you will never forget it). The man 
    finally gets the girls to believe him (for a change of pace, cell 
    phones do work in these woods) and uses his mountain climbing gear to 
    escape the cabin and try to help the last remaining girl to escape to 
    the nearest town. The final denouement is good, as are the Bigfoot 
    costume and gore effects. Definitely worth a watch, but don't view in 
    on regular TV (like SyFy or Chiller) because you'll be missing some 
    top-of-the-line gore and nudity. Rent or buy the DVD or watch it on

    Many genre fans have given up on director Tobe Hooper, sometimes 
    panning his latter-day films without even watching them. Well, I'm 
    here to defend him. Sure, he turned out some bad flicks (<B><A HREF="crocodile_2000.htm">CROCODILE</A></B> 
    - 2000), but this film is an effective, atmospheric, little chiller 
    that mixes a few genres to good effect. Widowed mom Mary Crosby and 
    her kids moves into a house that use to be a farmhouse, but is now a 
    mortuary, complete with a graveyard as a backyard. There's also a 
    black fungus overrunning the house that, when touched or eaten, turns 
    you into something less than human (The &quot;dinner scene&quot; will 
    have you tossing your cookies!). There's also a monster (the deformed 
    son of the farmer who previously owned the house) that lurks in the 
    underground tunnels that litter the graveyard. It all comes together 
    in the end, but I'll leave that for you to discover. Like him or not, 
    at least Hooper is still working at a steady pace, which is more than 
    I can say about most directors that got their start in the 70's; <B><A HREF="room_6_2005.htm">ROOM

    answer. Later in the day, her boyfriend gets into an accident with

    Amy is deathly afraid of hospitals, but goes there anyway to see her

    his sister, but no one can find her, either. The rest of the film is 
    a series of events which may be real or a figment of Amy's

    the murders, the 2005 film tells the story about the toll it takes on

    standoffish to his new neighbors, especially the men across the 
    street, Norman and Frank (Steven Weber and Russell Wong). Norman 
    thinks Doctor Peoples his having an affair with his wife Maria (Nia 
    Peeples) and has killed his own wife, but surveillence expert Frank 
    discovers that his wife died years ago after giving birth and Peoples 
    gave up the kid for adoption. Meanwhile, Norman is having troubles 
    with his own son Obert (Tyler Posey), who is afraid of water and who 
    has to go to a psychiatrist, who believes Obert is being sexually 
    abused by the family and threatens to take the kid away unless he 
    becomes an outpatient at his clinic. Doctor Peoples holds a garage 
    sale, where people in the neighborhood buy all sorts of nice things 
    for ridiculously low prices (there's a reason for that) and Maria and 
    Obert becomes friend with him, which makes Norman even more certain 
    Maria is having an affair with him. To say any more would be to 
    destroy one unexpected ending (some aspects of the &quot;reveal&quot; 
    may be too coincidental to some, but so what?), where everyone we 
    have seen in the film are not what they seem. Director/writer David

    Collins Jr. and DTV king Cuba Gooding Jr. (this must be the first 
    time two Jr.'s had top co-billing!) are ex-gangbangers-turned police 
    officers and they are exactly what the title of the movie implies. 
    Collins sees people with demon faces (great makeup effects work by 
    Almost Human Inc.) after he shoots an innocent old Latino man that 
    Gooding was harrassing when he thinks the old man was reaching for a 
    gun (he wasn't) and now he suffers from delusions every time he looks 
    at a Latino face. They work with an equally dirty boss (Keith David) 
    in running a drugs for cash deal with Jamaican drug bosses (one of 
    them portrayed rather nicely by musician Wyclef Jean), but things of 
    course go absolutely haywire thanks to Gooding's constant abuse of 
    people he runs into (what he does to young Latino girl Rita, 
    portrayed by Aimee Garcia, is absolutely horrendous). This is a fine 
    actioner as well as an emotional rollercoaster ride, with plenty of 
    violence and even a scene of Russian Roulette (umpired by character 
    actor supreme Robert LaSardo as a Latino drug head who wants the

    begins to terrorize the town. Filled with B-Movie references and 
    never taking itself seriously, this film is an enjoyable throwback to 
    all those giant monster films of the 1950's. Besides, this is the 
    only film shown on the Sci Fi Network ever nominated for an Emmy for 
    Best Visual Effects!; <B><A HREF="blood_angels_2005.htm">BLOOD ANGELS</A></B> 
    (2005) is a funny and bloody vampire tale about a young woman (Siri

    that they are all &quot;half vampires&quot;. They are not full-blown 
    vampires, but still suck blood and have more strength than a normal 
    human. All these women would like nothing more to be normal humans 
    again, but as long as their master, Mr. Jones (a hilarious Lorenzo

    worse), but there is a traitor among his ranks. While in Bucharest, 
    Romania (where most of these DTV actioners are filmed), he is 
    betrayed while making an illegal weapons buy by a phone call one of 
    the bad guys received. The phone call says that Sonni is a police

    that he has a trial in the United States in a couple of days and he 
    must appear, otherwise he will be considered a fugitive. Michael asks 
    Sonni to do him a favor since he is flying to New York: He must 
    escort Nadia Cominski (Silvia Colloca) to New York and hand her over 
    to the CIA there, since she was found with millions of dollars trying 
    to leave the country and her husband is dead (Did she do it?). The 
    rest of the film is a series of well-staged gunfights, car chases and 
    crashes and hand-to-hand combat, as Sonni and Nadia try to make it 
    out of Romania while a crime kingpin and his men try to stop the 
    pair. Action fans really could not ask for more. A little trivia:

    vagina (&quot;vagina dentata&quot; is the medical term)! When her 
    sexually pent-up boyfriend forces her to have sex in an underwater 
    cave, her pussy teeth castrate him (we see his penis lying on a 
    rock). After her gynecologist has his fingers bitten off during a

    her leering half-brother (his brutish dog eats his penis after the 
    sex act, so he has no chance of having it reattached!) and she leaves 
    town for points unknown, knowing that she is empowered over any man, 
    but can never have true love unless a man can love her for who she is 
    (her final leer into the camera tells the whole story). A good horror 
    story told matter-of-factly by director/writer Mitchell Lichtenstein 
    and not for shock effect (although one shot of a guy holding his 
    penis stump while blood squirts out will get your attention). I 
    guarantee all men, though, will be holding their junk when anyone has 
    sex with Dawn (My favorite scene comes when an operating team goes to

    the execution is unique. When the film is in color, the friends look

    Naylor as the ex-Special Forces/ex-con that big boss Hustle (E-40) 
    sent to help the crew in robbing the bank and Traci Dinwiddie 
    (credited here as &quot;T-Love&quot;, even though she is not a 
    musician, but an actual actress) as a female police officer trapped 
    in the bank with the robbers. The thing here is that shooting the 
    creatures in the head has no effect; they must be shot or stabbed in 
    the heart. Yes, there is a lot of unanswered questions and 
    questionable situations, but it is a quick 75 minutes and everyone 
    involved, including first-time feature director/co-screenwriter Bo 
    Webb, do an admirable job with a small amout of money. It is also 
    gory and bloody. Known is some foreign territories as <B><A HREF="dead_heist_2007.htm">BANK

    fort on Roanoke Island in what was to become a part of North

    the Native Americans that lived there, although there is no proof of 
    that. This is just one interpretation of what may have happened and

    squad of mercenaries, led by DC (Ray Stevenson), are on a a mission 
    in modern-day Eastern Europe. They stumble upon an old Nazi Bunker 
    from WWII and they are mysteriously slaughtered one-by-one by a squad 
    of the Nazi living dead, who have been there for over 50 years. These 
    Nazi soldiers were the experiments performed by notorious German

    deaths and a truly memorable finale, where the Nazi zombies push the 
    mercenaries back farther and farther in to the bunker, stabbing those 
    repeatedly with their bayonettes if they move too slowly. This film 
    was so popular on disc, that Barker made an equally enjoyable sequel, <B><A HREF="outpost_black_sun_2012.htm">OUTPOST:

    murder people for totally insane reasons. Instead of focusing on the 
    entire city's population, this film studies an affected group who are

     POUGHKEEPSIE TAPES</A></B> (2007) is a found footage film that I 
    actually like (love would be too strong a word due to this film's 
    subject matter). Throughout the 1990's, the town of Poughkeepsie, New 
    York was terrorized by a serial killer known as &quot;The Water 
    Street Butcher&quot;, who was so smart, he fooled even the F.B.I. 
    with his killings, as he always changed his M.O. But like all serial 
    killers, he fucked up and the F.B.I. was able to track where he 
    lived, but when they invaded his house, all they found was a closet 
    full of hundreds of VHS tapes and a wooden coffin containing the 
    still-alive (but barely) body of one of his first victims, Cheryl 
    Dempsey (Stacy Chbosky), who was kidnapped when she was just 
    14-years-old and is now a young woman, suffering nearly ten years of 
    brutal, sadistic sexual torture and other acts so severe, it would 
    hurt to mention them. While some of the tapes depict the serial 
    killer torturing and killing his many victims in many horrifying 
    ways, the majority of the tapes deal with Cheryl's tortures and how 
    she was brainwashed to obey her captor's every desire, including 
    having her actually murder some of his victims (Cheryl eventually 
    committed suicide after she was rescued, as she could not handle not 
    being without her captor!). This film doesn't sugarcoat anything and 
    even though it is fictional, you will believe that there are evil 
    people just like this in our world, as the killings and sexual 
    torture were based on real-life serial killers' actions, like Ted 
    Bundy and other famous sadistic murderers. Directed &amp; written 
    capably by John Erick Dowdle, who made two other found footage films 
    that I really disliked (<B><A HREF="quarantine_2008.htm">QUARANTINE</A></B>

    to VOD and then pulled quickly after one week. Thankfully, Scream 
    Factory released it in a DVD/Blu-Ray combo pack in 2017 and can 
    currently be seen streaming on Amazon Prime (review written in

     TO KILL</A></B> - 2009) and screenwriter Seagal. Seagal is decorated 
    Memphis homicide detective Jacob King, who is reknown for bringing 
    down serial killers, due to his brother being killed by one when they 
    were both children. His latest investigation leads him to another one 
    named Lazerus (Michael Filipowich), who the press have dubbed 
    &quot;The Grifter&quot;. Lazerus is known for leaving signs of the 
    zodiac on the bodies of prostitutes (and sometimes inside their 
    bodies) as clues. Lazerus proves to be more than a match for Jacob, 
    even leaving evidence at the scene of one crime which implicates 
    Jacob as the killer. A previous serial killer (who planted bombs 
    inside people's bodies) is released from prison due to Jacob's false 
    implication as a killer cop and murders Jacob's girlfriend, who is 
    also a cop. Jacob is able to solve Lazerus' crimes by using 
    cryptography, beating the shit out of Memphis criminals (the use of a 
    stunt double in some of Seagal's fights is highly obvious, though), 
    relying on the sympathetic coroner's findings (portrayed by the late 
    Isaac Hayes) and eventually kills the previously released serial 
    killer and captures Lazerus, who confesses to all the crimes he

     OF INTEREST</A></B> - 2011-2016) is a traveler from another planet 
    whose spaceship has technical problems and crash-lands into a lake on 
    Earth during the time of the Vikings. He has a portable tracking 
    device and,&nbsp; in one of the film's biggest mistakes, it instantly 
    teaches Kainan the language of the Dutch (by attaching a device to 
    his eye), which happens to be English! Kainan has also brought 
    something else with him to Earth: an alien predator known as the 
    Moorwen, which looks like a cross between a dragon and God knows what 
    (it's tail is made of fire which it uses to behead people, which we 
    are lovingly shown in close-up) and it loves the taste of human 
    flesh. Kainan is captured by Hrothgar's (the late John Hurt) 
    clan,&nbsp; whose daughter Freya (Sophia Myles; <B><A HREF="damned_2013.htm">THE
     DAMNED</A></B> - 2013) has an arranged marraige with brute Gunnar 
    (an unrecognizable Ron Perlman with a tattooed face) who has the 
    strongest clan in the area and has no problem proving it.&nbsp; Of 
    course, Freya falls in love with Kainan and Hrothgar's clan 
    unsuccessfully fight the Morween, who have increased in number. The 
    only way to kill it is to use modern weapons, so Kainan pulls a piece 
    of metal off his spaceship and has the blacksmith fashion swords made 
    out of this new metal. It seems the Queen Morween and her hungry 
    children are living beneath the town's water well, so Kainan and some 
    brave Vikings, including Wulfric (John Huston: TV's <B><A HREF="boardwalk_empire_tv_series.htm">BOARDWALK
     EMPIRE</A></B> - 2010-2014), Boromir (Cliff Saunders) and Unferth 
    (Patrick Stevenson) go down the well to save Freya (who was taken 
    prisoner by the monster) and kill the last of the Moorwen. Kainan is 
    able to do it and save Freya, but everyone else dies. His tracking 
    device has sent out a rescue signal and as a ship is about to land, 
    he destroys the device, sending the rescue ship back to space. All 
    this is secretly seen by Freya, who believes Kainan is a God who 
    rebuked going back to where the Gods live to stay with her and the 
    little boy Galen (Owen Pattinson) he adopted as his own (On his own 
    planet, he had a wife and child, but they were killed by the 
    Moorwen). Those expecting a SyFy-type CGI fest will be quite 
    surprised, as the Moorwen are done realistically and there is more 
    blood and gore than usual in sci-fi films. This is a nice little 
    sleeper of a film that deserved a better fate than it got. Director 
    Howard McCain (<B><A HREF="shadow_of_a_scream_1996.htm">SHADOW OF A SCREAM</A></B>

    sentenced to three years in a maximum security prison for involuntary 
    manslaughter (he would have gotten away scott-free if he killed the

    Walker had to die at such a young age, because he was developing into 
    a good actor. Watch it when you get the chance; <B><A HREF="rosencrantz_and_guildenstern_are_undead_2008.htm">ROSENCRANTZ

    ultimatum (he lives in a room next to his father's practice!). 
    Unfortunately, the play is full of real vampire actors and what 
    happens next is best left for the viewer to discover. I will say 
    this: You will never see funnier performances from Ralph Macchio (as

    damn if it's not funny as hell. An experimental government zombie 
    escapes from a laboratory and bites a stripper at Robert Englund's 
    (who has never been funnier) illegal strip club. Instead of being 
    disgusted, the male audience becomes even more turned-on by the

    (2008), which I really wanted to hate since it's basically another 
    zombie flick, but the storyline is so fun, unusual and bloody that it 
    won me over. An alien bacteria infects a military base, turning 
    everyone there into mindless flesheaters. The military destroys the 
    base, but one scientist escapes (with a sample of the bacteria) and 
    he takes a basement room in a barrio apartment complex, where three 
    inept Latino gang members (and a Special Forces member sent to kill 
    him) threaten him until the head gang member gets shot. He seems the 
    perfect subject to try out the new bacteria serum the scientist has 
    invented, but all he does is infect nearly the entire apartment 
    complex after the gang member becomes a black goo-drooling zombie. 
    The acting is above average for this kind of film and actor Nathan

    new town when her mother (Marin Hinkle) stabs Molly in the chest (she 
    thinks her daughter will soon become something best for the viewer to

     CADILLAC</A></B> (2008) is a Stephen King short story (Loosely based 
    on Poe's &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot;) done right from his 
    book of short stories called &quot;Nightmares And Dreamscapes&quot; 
    (which was turned into a <A HREF="nightmares_and_dreamscapes_tv_miniseries_2006.htm">four
     week mini-series in 2006</A>). It runs less than 90 minutes, doesn't 
    have time for dead spots and is a good tale of revenge and 
    retribution done in a way not seen on screen before (and if you think 
    I am going to tell you what it is, you are nuts.). Robinson and 
    Elizabeth (Wes Bentley and Emmanuelle Vaugier) are a married couple 
    very much in love and hoping to have a baby. They are also both 
    teachers at a grade school. One day, Elizabeth decides to take a 
    horse ride in the desert and spots Dolan (Christian Slater, who is 
    beyond fantastic here. Yes, you heard me right!) and his entourage in 
    his custom-made bulletproof Cadillac SUV shoot some coyotes (not the 
    animal kind, but the kind that sneak illegal aliens across the 
    border) for not checking the fan in the back of their truck, as half 
    the illegals, which Dolan sells to the highest bidder, are dead from 
    heatstroke. One illegal female runs Elizabeth's way and watches Dolan 
    shoot her to death. She takes off on her horse, but drops her cell 
    phone in the process. Robinson and Elizabeth go to the police and are 
    told that they are very well aware of Dolan's activities (he even 
    traffics in young children), but there is very little thay can do 
    because they haven't been able to catch him in the act. When Robinson 
    and Elizabeth go home, the find the dead illegal woman on their bed, 
    so the FBI puts them in a safe house. On the day Elizabeth finds out 
    she may be pregnant, but doesn't have a pregnancy test, she hops in 
    her car to go get one, but as soon as she turns the key, the car 
    explodes and she dies. Robinson's gets no satisfaction from the 
    police or FBI, so he decides to take Dolan on by himself. He quits 
    his job as a school teacher, buys a big-ass six-shooter (There a 
    funny scene when he first fires the weapon in the desert) and gets 
    work on a road construction crew, where he learns how to operate all 
    the heavy machinery and vehicles. Robinson then puts his revenge and 
    retribution plan into effect and it very much involves Dolan's 
    Cadillac. To tell you any more would be to ruin one of the best traps 
    I have seen in a film in quite a while and the way Robinson treats 
    the still-living Dolan is a treat for the eyes and the ears. Director 
    Jeff Beesley (This film went straight to DTV and didn't even get a 
    limited theatrical release, which is a shame, because it has 
    everything to become a cult favorite) and screenwriter Richard 
    Dooling (his first feature film screenplay) hold your attention for 
    every second of the film's 89 minutes and fill it with recognizable 
    actors like Al Sapienza as the worthless FBI agent, Karen LeBlanc as 
    Dolan's driver and especially Aidan Devine as Dolan's right-hand man 
    Roman, who is growing tired of Dolan's dirty business, especially 
    with kidnapped children. Look for little nods to Poe's story in this 
    film and enjoy it. This is a Stephen King movie done right.;<A NAME="OneEyedMonster2008"></A>&nbsp;

    even though she also plays herself (Think playing yourself is easy? 
    It ain't!). A group of porn filmmakers and actors travel to a 
    secluded cabin in the mountains to make an adult film, just as a

    mountain road. Ron (Ron Jeremy; the awful <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CursePirateDeath">CURSE
     OF PIRATE DEATH</A></B> - 2006) goes outside to catch his breath 
    before filming his first scene with Veronica and sees a shooting

    possesses him. When he films his first scene with Hart, his 
    disembodied 9 3/4-inch penis nearly kills Veronica, but Ron dies 
    instead, dickless (the crew stop Veronica's internal bleeding by 
    shoving a bunch of tampons taped together up her hooch!). The penis 
    then begins killing the cast and crew one-by-one until only Veronica, 
    lighting technician Jonah (Jason Graham) and script girl Laura (Amber 
    Benson; <B><A HREF="intermedio_2005.htm">INTERMEDIO</A></B> - 2005), 
    who is in love with Ron's detached penis (!), are left. But it's not 
    the story that's important here, it's the dialogue, which is 
    hilariously funny. Sample: <B>Jim</B> (Jeff Denton): &quot;Okay, Ron, 
    take off your sweater.&quot; <B>Ron:</B> &quot;I'm not wearing a 
    sweater.&quot; <B>Jim:</B> &quot;Okay, and... action!&quot; I have to 
    tell you, I was nearly crying I was laughing so much, but I'll leave 
    that for you to discover. Director/co-screenwriter Adam Fields has 
    made a film that fires on all cylinders and the late Charles Napier (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DeepSpace">DEEP
     SPACE</A></B> - 1987), of all people, turns in a very funny 
    performance as an alcoholic Vietnam veteran who once killed a 
    detachable alien penis in the jungles of 'Nam. He delivers one of the 
    best pieces of (long) funny dialogue explaining how he killed the 
    penis. Everyone in this film is fantastic and Jeremy's pep talk to 
    Veronica early in the film is one of the best pieces of acting I ever 
    saw him deliver. There's also some very graphic deaths (especially 
    Jeff Denton's; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#ClownTown2015">CLOWNTOWN</A></B> 
    - 2015), but it is all done for comic effect. All I want to know is 
    this: Why hasn't Adam Fields made another film since this one? It's 
    early in 2020 as I write this review and this is his final credit 
    (it's his only feature film as director). He certainly has the 
    talent, but I can only guess that since this film deals with porn 
    (it's Rated R, but it's a Hard R [no joke intended]), it stigmatized 
    him in the industry. When are Hollywood types going to learn that 
    porn is not poison? Ron Jeremy found a second career appearing in 
    genre films, but he had to fight hard to get those roles. I only hope 
    Adam Fields battles as hard to make another film. If you are not a 
    part of the &quot;Moral Majority&quot;, I'd advise you check this 
    film out (it is available streaming on Amazon Prime at the time of

    It's April of 2020 as I write this and my friend Michael Prymula 
    reminded me that I was reviewing a bunch of killer clown films and 
    recommended I watch <B><A HREF="klown_kamp_massacre_2008.htm">KLOWN 
    KAMP MASSACRE</A></B> (2008). Since he and I have similar taste in 
    films, I decided to take up his recommendation since the film was 
    free to watch streaming on Amazon Prime, so all it would cost me is 
    my time. I'm happy to say that I enjoyed this ultra-low-budget horror 
    comedy and found myself laughing out loud on several occasions. 
    Twenty years ago, Edwin (Jared Herholtz), who wanted to be a clown in 
    the worse way, massacred the entire clown graduating class at the 
    Bonzo Ranch, a clown college hosted by the famous Bonzo The Clown 
    (Mike Miller), when no one laughed at his whoopie cushion bit at his 
    graduation audition (in which he was to be graded on to see if he 
    would graduate) when a cell phone started ringing as it was about to 
    let out the fart noise (Back then, it was way too early to have a 
    &quot;turn off your cell phone&quot; clause for the audience, as the 
    audience clown member had one of those heavy brick-shaped cell 
    phones!). He videotaped the massacre for his mother (a really funny 
    opening bit, as Edwin talks like Bobcat Goldthwait, narrating his 
    killings in a very amusing manner and he shows his mother the carnage 
    he caused) and then disappeared off the face of the map. Cut to the 
    present, as Edwin is watching TV and sees Bonzo announce that he is 
    re-opening his clown camp at the Bonzo Ranch, so Edwin heads there to 
    massacre the new class of clown wannabes. We are then introduced to 
    the new members of Bonzo's clown camp. <A HREF="klown_kamp_massacre_2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/klown kamp massacre amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>There's
     Philbert (Ross Kelly), the &quot;hero&quot; of this story. He falls 
    in love with Valerie (Ashley Bryce), who doesn't want to be a clown 
    but comes there to escape her rapey father, who was a clown. Puff 
    (Chris K. Payne) is a magician clown and Buzter Pie (Isaac Kappy) is 
    a rapping clown from Detroit. There's also brothers Lenny (Reuben 
    Finkelstein), a simpleton retard of a clown, and Vinnie (Nick Lopez), 
    who puts Lenny down every chance he gets. Rounding out the clown cast 
    is Squirts (Sandor Gattyan), the masturbating clown (&quot;Wanna see 
    my weiner?&quot;), lovers Tipsy (Matt Sanford) &amp; Brandi (Tara 
    Hahn), who can't stop having sex, and Funnybone (Miguel Martinez) and 
    his sidekick Flopsy McCool (Kevin R. Elder), a man in an gorilla 
    suit. Funnybone whips this class into shape like a Marine drill 
    sargeant (He can also throw a cream pie 500 yards and hit a target 
    directly in the middle!). It's not long before Edwin arrives at the 
    ranch and begins dispatching the clowns in very gory, but funny ways. 
    While Tipsy is slammin' Brandi doggy style, Brandi says she heard a 
    noise and tells him to go and investigate. When he comes back and 
    continues the doggy style action, he discovers that Brandi is missing 
    her head, when Edwin appears, holding Brandi's severed head by her 
    hair in his hand, as he dispatches Tipsy. Funnybone takes a cream pie 
    to his face, followed by Edwin shoving a knife into the pie and 
    Funnybone's face, the blade exiting out of the back of his head. 
    Squirts gets his throat slit, but Squirts can't stop masturbating, 
    even as he is dying, resulting in him ejaculating into his mouth, 
    smiling and then dying! While practicing the old seltzer water bit 
    (&quot;A little song, a little dance, a little seltzer down his 
    pants.&quot;), Lenny shoots Vinnie in the face with the water, but 
    it's actually acid and Lenny's face disappears (His face is now 
    nothing but a lower jaw and half a skull), but he somehow survives (A 
    very funny bit!). I could go on, but there's a lot more going on here 
    than you would think, including a takeoff on <A HREF="friday_the_13th_1980.htm"><B>FRIDAY
     THE 13TH</B></A> (1980), where &quot;Crazy Ernie&quot; (Kevin R. 
    Elder again) warns the new members of the clown camp that they are 
    &quot;doomed', just like Crazy Ralph did in the aforementioned film, 
    but when he realizes they are going to clown camp and not the lake 
    next to the camp, he says &quot;Never mind!&quot;, hops on his bike 
    and pedals away as the clowns get in their car and drive away. Crazy 
    Ernie then comes on screen and says that the clown camp is also 
    doomed, but it's too late for anyone to listen to him, so he heads to 
    the clown camp to warn them (where he gets attacked by a bear!). 
    There's a lot more funny and gory stuff to recommend here, but the 
    film is taken down a couple of notches when Lloyd Kaufman appears in 
    the final minutes as &quot;Vic Vickers&quot; and does his usual 
    overacting bit (even during the final credits!), which seems to be 
    inserted in the film long after it was finished (probably because 
    Troma distributed this film on DVD and it was mandatory Kaufman be in 
    it). The film didn't need Kaufman's overacting because the film is 
    filled with it and it makes you realize what a lousy actor he really 
    is (Really he is, as he only has one look when he poses for photos 
    and he does it many times here). Directors/writers Philip Gunn &amp; 
    David Valdez (this is their only full-length feature film) are to be 
    congratulated for turning what is probably a budget much less than 
    most big-budget films spend on one day's craft service into something 
    very funny and entertaining. Be aware that this film isn't for 
    everybody, especially if you don't enjoy cheap humor, but you'll know 
    whether or not it's for you just by the opening minutes. Me? I 
    absolutely enjoyed it. Thanks Michael!;<A NAME="TenDeadMen2008"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="ten_dead_men_2008.htm">TEN DEAD MEN</A></B> (2008) is a 
    fast paced British actioner that is violent beyond belief. When 
    former hood Ryan (Brendan Carr) quits his violent ways after finding 
    true love with Amy (Pooja Shah), his boss doesn't take too kindly to 
    it, so he has ten people kidnap Ryan (They use him as a punching bag 
    and for batting practice!) and make him watch as they shoot Amy in 
    the stomach (she was about to tell Ryan she is pregnant) and then 
    point blank<A HREF="ten_dead_men_2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ten dead men poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    into her head, her blood spattering all over Ryan's face. They then 
    shoot Ryan three times, wrap him in plastic and dump his body in the 
    ocean. They should have shot Ryan in the head, because he somehow 
    survives and goes on a killing spree, killing all ten men responsible 
    for Amy's death and taking souveniers (an eye, a cigarette lighter, 
    and a tongue, among other personal items) from each of the dead men, 
    carrying them with him in a plastic bag! That's basically the whole 
    film in a nutshell, so what makes it so unusual, you may ask? Ryan 
    never speaks a single word in the film until the final kill; a cruel 
    man known simply as the &quot;Projects Manager&quot; (Keith Eyles), 
    who takes joy in taking photos of dead people he has killed (he takes 
    a photo of a dead Amy, knowing fully well that she was pregnant!). 
    Instead of hearing Ryan speak, we hear all about his trials and 
    trevails from &quot;The Narrator&quot; (Doug Bradley; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#ScreamPark2012">SCREAM
     PARK</A></B> - 2012), an offscreen voice who lets us know what is 
    important in Ryan's life&nbsp; and why he picks out these ten men to 
    kill (Every time Ryan kills one of them, their photo goes up in 
    flames). This is a quick and very bloody ride, as Ryan, shoots, 
    punches and kicks his way through all ten men, the fight choreography 
    being excellent and very bloody. The final twenty minutes are a 
    non-stop barrage of death and destruction, as Ryan shoots his way 
    through the Project Manager's men, saving him for a final bloody 
    demise. Forget the plot and just enjoy all the blood and gore on 
    view, as one man gets his jaw torn off, another gets his tongue cut 
    out, another gets an electric drill to his leg and still another has 
    a huge shard of glass impaled in his foot. Director Ross Boyask has 
    fashioned a film short on story , but revels in bloodshed, so those 
    looking for a bloody good time will find it here. It's nothing 
    exceptional, just a nice violent film that should satisfy your 
    violence jones. We all need films like this every now and then, don't we?;<A NAME="Horseman2008"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="horseman_2008.htm">THE HORSEMAN</A></B> (2008) is a raw 
    and brutal Australian revenge thriller that takes no prisoners. The 
    story itself is very simple, but the film is a hard watch, as the 
    violence on view is very realistic, not &quot;stylized&quot; (like 
    most violence in films today) and upsetting, even though it's the 
    scumbags who are getting punished (at least until the end). When 
    father Christian Forteski (an amazing Peter Marshall) is told by 
    police that his troubled teenage daughter has been murdered, he 
    discovers she was also raped and was forced (?) to appear in a <A HREF="horseman_2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/horseman 2008 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>porn
     film, so he decides to get even with the people who were responsible 
    when the police tell him there is nothing they can do because there 
    is no evidence. Christian begins to get evidence by starting at the 
    bottom of the ladder of those responsible, beginning with people who 
    worked on the porn film. He tortures them with baseball bats, metal 
    pipes, crowbars, knives, spraying them with gasoline and setting them 
    on fire until they give up names. When they do, Christian has no 
    trouble murdering them in cold blood, the same way his daughter was 
    murdered. As Christian travels in his van, he picks up troubled 
    18-year-old Alice (Caroline Marohasy) on the side of the road and 
    treats her with kindness, like an ad hoc daughter. He discovers that 
    Alice is pregnant and she is traveling to tell the man who 
    impregnated her, so he will chip in for her abortion. Christian stops 
    from town to town, putting a beatdown/killing to the people who were 
    named by his previous dead victims, until the main villains kidnap 
    Alice and threaten to kill her unless Christian surrenders himself to 
    them. What happens next is an uncompromising look at violence, as 
    Christian is tortured (he has his right nipple pulled off with pliers 
    and the wound cauterized with a butane torch!) until he escapes (with 
    Alice's help) and ends with him fighting the head bad guy (who looks 
    like Karl Urban, but isn't), who doesn't seem to want to die. 
    Director/screenwriter Steven Kastrissios has made a film that takes a 
    strong stomach to watch, as the violence is very bloody and done in a 
    very realistic way. When people are hit with bats or metal pipes, 
    they don't get up (unlike other films in this genre) and when 
    Christian is tortured, we feel his pain as the nipple is ripped from 
    his chest and he screams in pain (who wouldn't?). We also feel 
    Christian's emotional pain of losing his daughter and who wouldn't 
    want to dish out punishment to those who were responsible? This 
    hyper-realistic foray into violence is must viewing for all fans of 
    revenge films and the finale will have you sweating bullets because 
    it's a prime example of a revenge thriller done right. The film 
    doesn't really have a proper ending, it just ends, exactly like it 
    does in real life. I really enjoyed this film and you should, too, 
    but only if you are not queasy about realistic bloody violence.</FONT></FONT></P>

    may be one of the best of the giant insect films of the new 
    millennium. A slacker office worker (Chris Marquette) wakes up in his 
    office covered in a cocoon and once he breaks free, he discovers that 
    the Earth has been taken over by giant insects of all kinds and they 
    are able to combine themselves with humans. Played mostly for laughs 
    (more hits than misses), this film has some downright inventive CGI 
    creations that are half-human/half-insect hybrids. Buy or rent the 
    DVD, because the SyFy Channels shows a severely edited version; <B><A HREF="revenant_2009.htm">THE
     REVENANT</A></B> (2009) is one weird horror flick, but running at 
    nearly two hours (it was re-edited and scenes added for its limited 
    2011 theatrical release) nearly does it in. An American soldier in a 
    Humvee is killed in Iraq after his squad stops when a child runs in 
    front of their vehicle and something does <I>something</I> to him, 
    turning him into some kind of zombie/vampire/ghoul mixture impervious 
    to bullets. Back in the States, he and his best friend (who is also 
    turned into one of the creatures by his friend after being shot) go 
    on a vigilante spree, killing criminals and scumbags and drinking 
    their blood to stay alive. They then weigh down the dead bodies with 
    rocks and throw their meals off of a bridge wrapped in plastic. They 
    become media darlings (the Press dubs them the &quot;Vigilante 
    Gun-Slingers&quot;, but there is much more going on here than I can 
    explain in a short description), but things take a nasty turn when 
    their first victim breaks free of his underwater shackles (&quot;I 
    should have used more rocks!&quot;) and sends the head of the 
    soldier's best friend to him in a box. Surprisingly, the head is 
    still alive (the soldier squishes it with a steamroller after his 
    friend begs for death) and the soldier is captured by men in white 
    bio-suits (after the police kill nearly two dozen innocent bystanders 
    and themselves in the crossfire!). He is turned over to the military

    concentration camp survivors and their families, especially after 
    Boll portrayed Hitler as a comic foil to an extremely obese chick in 
    the previous film), but this film, about a young man (Brendan 
    Fletcher, also the Co-Producer) who grows bored with his life and 
    comes up with a plan to make it exciting is quite shocking and highly 
    watchable. He dons Kevlar protection from head to toe and begins 
    killing anyone he comes across (the body count is high and will leave 
    you slackjawed), shooting people indiscriminately in the street (and 
    the police who try to stop him) and then stops at the local bank and 
    robs it. What happens next is best for the viewer to discover, but if 
    there was such a thing as a &quot;perfect crime&quot;, this would be 
    it. Just when I had given up hope on Uwe Boll, he impresses me with a 
    film that could hold its own with many big-budget Hollywood 
    productions, although they wouldn't have the balls to show what Boll 
    does on-screen. Good show, Uwe. Good show. Followed by a sequel, <B><A HREF="rampage_capital_punishment_2014.htm">RAMPAGE:

     WHIPPED</A></B> (2008), and probably because he watched the 
    excellent DTV flicks of Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren, 
    Steven Seagal has begun to pick his DTV films judiciously (except for 
    the awful <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#AgainstTheDark2009">AGAINST 
    THE DARK</A></B> - 2009, but in Seagal's defense, he spends minimal 
    time on screen and did this film as a favor for a friend [at least 
    according to an angry email I received from someone who read my 
    negative review of the film]) and this one is a goodie. Seagal is 
    ex-New York Russian mobster-turned-novelist Ruslan (the film's 
    shooting title). When his daughter, who is engaged to the son of his 
    former enemy, is kidnapped, Ruslan comes out of retirement to save 
    her. For once, Seagal uses no stunt doubles for his fights and loops 
    his own voice in post-production. This may be a DTV action film, but 
    besides some weird choices in music during the fight scenes, this is 
    a violent, bloody good time. For even more good Seagal, see my review 
    of <B><A HREF="action.htm#Keeper2009">THE KEEPER</A></B> (2009) This 
    was also one of Seagal's first DTVs not to be released by Sony Home 
    Video in the United States (20th Century Fox/Echo Bridge Home 
    Entertainment handled the chores); Speaking of good Steven Seagal 
    films, add <B><A HREF="dangerous_man_2009.htm">A DANGEROUS MAN</A></B> 
    (2009) to the list. The plot may seem old hat: A ex-Special Forces 
    Agent (Seagal) is released from prison after serving six years for a 
    murder he didn't commit (the State of Arizona issues an apology to 
    him), only to find a girl named Tia (Marlaina Mah) and a bag of money 
    containing millions of dollars in the trunk of a car, after 
    witnessing the Chinese Mafia kill a cop. Now drug lords and corrupt 
    cops want&nbsp; him and Tia dead and their money back, so Seagal 
    turns for help from the Russian Mafia, whose don owes him a favor for 
    saving his son. Lots of bloody mayhem follows, but director Keoni 
    Waxman, who also directed Seagal in <B><A HREF="action.htm#Keeper2009">THE
     KEEPER</A></B> (2009), also does something most directors have 
    failed to do: He actually gets Seagal to act (or what we best can 
    call acting from Seagal) rather than just letting his hands and feet 
    get his point across. That is a miracle all in itself and makes this 
    movie a must-see for Seagal fans (call me a masochist, but I am one). 
    Seagal would take a short break from acting to star in the reality TV 
    series <B><A HREF="steven_seagal_lawman_tv_series_2009-2010.htm">STEVEN
     SEAGAL: LAWMAN</A></B> (2009 - 2010) documenting his life as a 
    Louisiana lawman, where he is a fully-commissioned deputy with the 
    Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office. There were allegations that some 
    of the scenes were staged. Image that, staging scenes in a reality 
    series? (Insert sarcasm here); Do you like blood, guts, graphic gore 
    and other perverse things and it's not in a horror film? Then <B><A HREF="tournament_2009.htm">THE
     TOURNAMENT</A></B> (2009) is for you. Here's the basic premise in a 
    nutshell: Every seven years (not ten years as the advance poster 
    says), a bunch of super-rich people gather together for the name of 
    the game in the title. They assemble together 20 of the world's 
    greatest assassins in a different country for every game (this time 
    it's a town in the United Kingdom; they do this as to not cause 
    suspicion with law enforcement) and they fight it out for the title 
    of the world's greatest assassin. Ving Rhames won it 7 years ago (he 
    graphically blows a guy's head off with a shotgun in the beginning of 
    the film and then has to shoot a friendly assassin to win the game) 
    and he has joined this Tournament because one of the assassins 
    participating in this year's game killed his pregnant wife 4 months 
    ago. All the assassins are fitted under their skin with a tracking 
    device shaped like a sniper's bullet, only this year the tracker also 
    has an explosive in it that will blow up their bodies (we see two 
    graphic displays of it happening) if they don't complete the game in 
    24 hours. Kelly Hu, a great assassin and martial artist, must also 
    protect a priest, played by Robert Carlyle, who swallowed one of the 
    trackers when a French assassin managed to pull out his tracker and 
    slip it in the priest's food, thereby making him look like one of the 
    assassins on the other assassins' electronic GPS tracking devices 
    (there's a funny scene where <A HREF="tournament_2009_shit_scene_photo.htm">Hu
     tries to get Carlyle to shit out the tracker</A>). Director Scott 
    Mann (his first feature-length directorial effort alone), fills the 
    film with shot-off appendages, a finger getting cut off and smoked 
    like a cigar, various bodies riddled with bullets (and I mean riddled 
    with bullets!), lots of hand-to-hand combat (look for Scott Adkins as 
    a Russian assassin who gets into a very good martial arts fight with 
    Hu in a church), an excellent bus/truck chase, some amazing Parkour 
    athleticism and gallons of blood flying through the air and 
    splattering against walls, floors and people (the scene in the 
    convenience store is funny and bloody as hell at the same time). Look 
    for Ian Somerhalder (<B><A HREF="vampire_diaries_tv_series_2009.htm">THE
     VAMPIRE DIARIES</A></B> [2009-Present]) as an American assassin who 
    is so mean, he kills his own dog. His demise is particularly juicy. 
    If I didn't know any better, my guess would be the idea of <B><A HREF="purge_2013.htm">THE
     PURGE</A></B> (2013) was influenced by this film. But this film is

    (2009) is good for one reason only: Zoe Bell (the film was created 
    just for her). I have had the hots for her ever since I saw her 
    performance in Quentin Tarantino's <B><A HREF="death_proof_2007.htm">DEATH
     PROOF</A></B> (2007). While she is not what would be considered a 
    beautiful woman, I love her because she is the kind of woman I would 
    want to know (maybe it's her Australian accent). In this film she 
    portrays expert hitwoman Eve and we see her go on her latest 
    assignment (she works for an agency with government ties). Something 
    goes wrong with the hit and she ends up with a large knife impaled in 
    her skull. She then kills everyone involved, including an innocent 
    young woman, who she shoots in the eye while she is screaming in an 
    elevator. Her temporary partner, Franklin (Justin Huen) takes her to 
    agency Dr. Rankin (Doug Jones; who also appeared with Bell in <B><A HREF="raze_2013.htm">RAZE</A></B> 
    -2013), who has to take a nose full of coke before he pulls the knife 
    out! The removal of the knife changes Eve dramatically. She is now 
    not the perfect unemotional killer that she once was and is haunted, 
    not just by what she did her entire life, but also by the ghost of 
    the young woman she shot in the elevator. She is sent out on several 
    jobs by agency head Graham Prescott (Brian Poth) and she screws up 
    royally, killing the wrong people (including a made man) and not 
    shooting one of her assignments. She becomes a liability to the 
    agency and you can guess what happens next. This film highlights Zoe 
    Bell's stuntwoman personae, as she fights, shoots, falls out of a 
    window and uses another human body to cushion her fall onto the roof 
    of a car and other unbelievable stunts. Director Paul Etheredge (the 
    gay horror film <B><A HREF="hellbent_2004.htm">HELLBENT</A></B> - 
    2004) keeps things moving at a quick clip and the film is very bloody 
    in spots (especially the Unrated Version). You will see sliced 
    throats, lots of bullet damage and other carnage, as Eve tries to 
    stay one step ahead of the agency. But it is Zoe Bell that makes this 
    film memorable. She doesn't take herself seriously and brings to the 
    film a sense of playfulness not usually seen in a brutal film of this 
    type. And it is only 77 minutes long so it doesn't overstay its 
    welcome. Recommended for people who enjoy a bloody good time.</FONT></FONT></P>

    (2009) is the kind of crime drama that makes you smile as well as 
    make you think. The plot is basically simple: Pyke Kubic and his twin 
    brother Reese (both portrayed by the excellent Sean Bean) perform 
    some type of crime where they have to throw a suitcase containing 
    over $700,000 off an overpass because they are being chased by the 
    police and Reese is captured and has to spend a few months in jail 
    for avoiding the police. The suitcase happens to land on the hood of 
    Sam Phelan's (Chris Hemsworth, who is also very good) crappy station 
    wagon and he cannot believe his good luck, since his wife Leslie 
    (Victoria Profeta, too good for words) is at the bank begging her 
    mortgage officer (Michael Mantell) to extend their mortgage, since 
    they owe over $7,000. He refuses to do so because they have been 
    behind before. Chris enters the bank and hands the surprised mortgage 
    officer the mortgage money in cash and then tells his wife what 
    happened. The Phelans then go on a spending spree, buying a new Land 
    Rover and new furniture for the house. What they don't count on is 
    that Pyke is a very smart criminal and he soon finds the Phelans. 
    Pyke is also the most frugal thief you will ever meet, because, even 
    though there is over $500,000 still left in the briefcase, he wants 
    the total amount that was originally in it (Even Reese thinks he is 
    pushing it too hard). Sam returns the Land Rover to where he bought 
    it, but soon finds out that it is now considered a used vehicle (even 
    though it only has 129 miles on it!) and the $70,000 he paid for it 
    means nothing. The car salesman (the same man who sold it to him new) 
    only offers him $53,000 for it, which he is forced to take by Pyke. 
    They cannot return the furniture, so Pyke makes Sam and Leslie become 
    stickup artists (with an empty gun) and gives them five days to get 
    the rest of the money. They become quite proficient at their craft 
    (they get into it a little too much), managing to rob 11 stores, 
    bodegas and liquor stores in one day. On the last of five days and 
    still over $5,000 behind, Sam comes up with the idea of robbing a 
    bank (He has other plans since he is not as stupid as he looks and 
    asks the right questions of Pyke.). The rest you are going to have to 
    see for yourself, because it has a happy ending (all the stickip 
    victims mysteriously get their money back and the victims that were 
    hurt [including the mortgage officer] get a little something extra) 
    until a final twist. Late director/screenwriter/co-producer Stephen 
    Milburn Anderson (<B><A HREF="dead_men_cant_dance_1997.htm">DEAD MEN 
    CAN'T DANCE</A></B> - 1997; who passed away at age 68 on May 1, 2015) 
    has made a film full of funny little twists and turns (the scene 
    between Pyke and the mortgage officer is a hoot and a half, as is 
    frugal Pyke's encounter with the motel manager, who wants a two day 
    refund since he payed for seven days and only spent five days there.) 
    and Sean Bean is unlike any professional crook you will ever meet. He 
    is very intelligent, polite, yet imposing, and even practices yoga! 
    He is also a math genius and has a conscience, such as when Leslie 
    tries to make love to him, but he turns her down because he doesn't 
    want to destroy a marriage. Give this film a try. I guarantee you 
    will like it it you are a crime drama fanatic.;&nbsp; <B><A HREF="cost_of_a_soul_2009.htm">COST

    but there are huge differences. My only complaint about the film is 
    that is was shot on the Red One Digital Camera with a lot of scenes 
    with the colors drained, but star Chris Kerson as Tommy Donahue is an 
    actor to watch in the future. The rest of the cast of relatively 
    unknown character actors do a great job of making their characters as 
    realistic as possible. A winner from freshman director/writer/producer

     MIND OF A SERIAL KILLER</B></A> (2009) is an effective horror flick 
    that is supposed to be based on fact. A nosey TV reporter for crime 
    TV series Last Steps who doesn't keep her promises (Danielle Harris, 
    the worst thing about this film) finds a man named Emmett (an 
    effective Lance Henriksen) who tells her the story about a serial 
    killer named Cyrus (Brian Krauss, who has never been better), dubbed 
    &quot;The Highway Hunter&quot; and &quot;The County Line 
    Cannibal&quot;, for the disappearances of over 200 women and serving 
    their flesh for meals at the local diner he owns. Cyrus begins by 
    killing his cheating wife, her lover and his baby and then serves 
    their flesh as hamburger meat at his eatery, which becomes an instant 
    hit with the local populace. He then begins killing women and men 
    thinking they are his cheating wife and their lovers, in ways that 
    are best left for the viewer to discover (there's a tongue-cutting 
    scene that will make you wince). As a matter of fact, this Unrated 
    gorefest holds nothing back, from Cyrus' time as a child, where his 
    whore mother kills his puppy, up until the finale, which you may 
    think you have figured out from the beginning, but you would be 
    wrong. Director/screenwriter Mark Vadik, tells the whole story from 
    Hendriksen's flashbacks with short interviews of convicts, police 
    officers and serial killer experts from the finished Last Steps TV 
    program. There's no humor in this story, which is refreshing and 
    there are appearances by Tiffany Shepis, Rae Dawn Chong and Kyle Van 
    Hook. Make sure you stay through the end credits for a thouroughly 
    truthful look at the minds of famous serial killers while a prison 
    warden tells a Last Steps reporter that the facts the program reports 
    about serial killers are all wrong. He explains that most serial 
    killers have fan clubs and sleep like babies at night. That right

    novelist at heart) and this dark adult fairy tale is an absolute 
    stunner and the kind of movie that makes you think long after it is 
    over. I won't give away much of the plot except to tell you this: an 
    amateur photographer named Jamie Morgan (a fantastic James Sturgess), 
    who was born with a dark red heart-shaped birthmark around his left 
    eye, takes photos on the darker side of life (there is very little 
    light in his life since everyone points and says something about his 
    birthmark ever since he was a child and he has never had a 
    girlfriend) and mistakenly takes photos of a secretive street gang 
    that have faces that look like mutated lizards. After the gang makes 
    him watch them burn his mother alive for discovering them, Jamie 
    makes a deal with Papa B (Joseph Mawle), who might be the Devil, to 
    make him look normal, but first he has to set himself on fire with a 
    Molotov cocktail (a scene that is very hard to watch). After shedding 
    his burned skin, he looks totally normal and his birthmatk is gone. 
    He meets a young woman named Tia (Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy) and 
    they start a relationship, but this is when things start to go very, 
    very wrong. Is what Jamie experiencing true or is it all in his mind? 
    Or is it a little bit of both? The conclusion (where an excellent 
    Timothy Spall portrays Jamie's dead father) seems to tie up the loose 
    ends, but this is the type of film you will have to see more than 
    once to get all the subtleties. Recommended on the highest level for 
    people who like to use their brains while watching a film; <B><A HREF="dog_pound_2009.htm">DOG

    some are portrayed as bad guys, but one guard turns out to be both, 
    due to circumstances beyond his emotional control. This French

    ex-alcoholic father (Martin Donovan) stays in their real house to

    a funeral parlor (maybe that's why the rent was so cheap!) and 
    something real nasty happened there in the past. To say any more

    extremely violent (even though if there's a little bit too much CGI 
    enhancement). During the mid-to-late 1800's, a samurai warrior named 
    Yang (Korean star Jang Dong Gun) defies his boss's orders and refuses 
    to kill a baby, instead taking the baby to America (actually filmed 
    in New Zealand) to a desert town occupied by carnival workers and 
    their run-down carnival (it's quite the sight and very inventive). 
    Yang becomes more than friends with Lynne (Kate Bosworth) and teaches 
    her the way of the knife and the sword (which will come in extremely 
    handy later on). Lynne becomes the baby's surrogate mother, when a 
    band of outlaws, led by the extremely demented leather mask-wearing 
    Colonel (Danny Huston), who wears the mask because of the way he 
    sexually forced himself on Lynne years before and her taking a flame 
    to his face (after leaving his brand on her back), ride into town and 
    cause mayhem, first by using a clown as target practice and then 
    dragging drunk sharpshooter Ronald (an unrecognizable Geoffrey Rush) 
    by horse. Yang manages to get rid of them, but the Colonel vows to 
    return. Yang gets Ronald to sober up and they plan for the Colonel's 
    return, but Yang's ex-boss (Lung Ti) and his samurai warriors also 
    return at the same time, which causes double the trouble. What 
    happens next is best left for the viewers to experience, but it is 
    action-packed, bloody as hell and quite innovative at times. 
    Director/screenwriter Sngmoo Lee (yes, it is spelled right and it is 
    his freshman effort), with some dialogue assist from Scott Reynolds 
    (who gives the Colonel some of the best lines), make a fast-paced 
    actioner with plenty of swordplay, gunfire and appendages getting 
    sliced off. Look for diminutive Tony Cox as Eight Ball. A South

     PRESENCE</A></B> (2010) may be the best ghost story of the New 
    Millennium. Rather than relying on gore and blood, this film relies 
    on atmosphere (it takes 17 minutes for the first words to be spoken!) 
    and a sense of dread so thick, it would take a large knife to cut 
    through it. Mira Sorvino stars as a woman who travels to a family 
    cabin on an isolated island (filmed in and around Mount Hood, Oregon) 
    to work on an illustrated book. She is fighting some personal demons 
    of her own, since her dead father sexually abused her when she was a 
    young girl, so when her boyfriend (Justin Kirk) shows up on the 
    island and proposes marriage with a beautiful ring, she at first says 
    yes, but soon begins acting strangely (the boyfriend seems to think 
    it's committment issues caused by her father, especially after she 
    loses the ring during an &quot;accident&quot;), all but ignoring her 
    boyfriend and telling him to get off the island. You see, there are 
    also two ghosts inhabiting the cabin/island: A silent one (Shane 
    West), who can't leave the cabin, and an evil one all dressed in 
    black (Tony Curran), who whispers ugly, dirty things into Sorvino's 
    ear, causing her to act the way she does. To say anymore would be to 
    ruin one of the best films of 2010, except to say the final 
    denouement will give you goosebumps every time you think about it. 
    Also starring Muse Watson as the boatman and Deobia Oparei as a 
    mysterious figure. A great directorial debut from Tom Provost, who 
    also wrote the thought-provoking screenplay. I can't wait to see what

    which is a hit with the audiences. As the crowds in the theater grow 
    bigger, so do her productions and she begins killing-off friends and 
    storing their bodies in the theater's attic. Needless to say, the 
    more bodies she puts up there, the heavier it gets, which leads to a

    owns the local crematorium (&quot;The casket is just for show.&quot;

    (2010) because it is cheesy, a little too philosophical and runs a 
    little overlong at 124 minutes, but I'll be damned that every time I 
    flip through my pay cable channels and this film is showing, I have 
    to stop and watch it till the end. This star-studded film, which 
    barely caused a ripple in theaters, is really nothing but a mash-up 
    of every genre of action and musical film (but without the music; 
    you'll get it when you watch it) except gunfights, because guns have 
    been banned in either this parallel world or a peek at our future. 
    And the fact that hardly anyone except the bad guys (and gals) are 
    given proper names will remind you of Spaghetti Westerns, too. All I 
    know it that it is full of action, has some great fight scenes and 
    plenty of gory deaths. If you want to know what &quot;Bunraku&quot; 
    means, I suggest you Google it (you will see several examples of it 
    in this film) and you can't beat the cast: Josh Harnett, Gackt Camui

    Kevin McKidd as a fedora-wearing supreme killer (who may be gay) and

    store clerks are in on the joke. Unfortunately, one of the pledges

    the previous tenants) and our friendly duo save one of the college 
    girls, Allison (Katrina Bowden), from drowning, but the rest of the 
    college kids think the duo have kidnapped her for nefarious reasons. 
    The film is full of funny, gory deaths, such as when Tucker 
    accentally hits a bees nest with his chainsaw after cutting a log and 
    it looks like he is chasing the kids with the chainsaw when he is 
    actually swatting at the bees with it, forcing one of the running 
    kids to impale himself on a tree branch. Another trips and falls 
    head-first into a wood chipper, another falls on his own homemade 
    spear and runs it through his stomach until the dull end protrudes 
    out his back, slowly sliding down it, bleeding all over a prone Dale, 
    and the town sheriff accidentally trips one of the cabin's 
    unintentional booby traps and has a block of wood with nails in it 
    penetrate his head (Dale: &quot;I knew we should have fixed 
    that!&quot;). The rest of the college kids kidnap Tucker and cut off 
    two of his fingers in exchange for Allison (who is absolutely in no 
    danger), which leads to the two sides into an exchange of words in 
    the cabin with Allison's help. Turns out that one of the college 
    kids, Chad (Jesse Moss), had his father (who mysteriously 
    disappeared) and some of his parents' friends killed in the same neck 
    of the woods twenty years earlier by a hillbilly psychopath, but his 
    pregnant mother escaped, delivered Chad and she was then was 
    institutionalized. Chad turns out o be the film's villain and looks 
    to get even with the hillbillies and Allison, who he thinks has been 
    brainwashed (&quot;You've gone hillbilly on me, Allison!&quot;).

     PLAY</A></B> (2010) is one of the most unusual films I have seen in 
    quite a while. It opens in the middle of the desert, where washed-up 
    jass trumpet player Nate Poole (Mickey Rourke) is about to get shot 
    in the back of the head when he is saved by a bunch of faceless 
    assassins dressed all in white, who gun down his would-be killer. 
    Nate roams the desert until he comes to a traveling carnival and 
    meets Lily Luster (Megan Fox in one of her best acting roles), a 
    beautiful freak who actually has full-sized wings attached to her 
    back like an angel. Lily is sought after by cruel gangster Happy 
    Shannon (Bill Murray, in an unusual role), who wants to display Lily 
    in a glass cage at his nightclub, but Nate tries to protect her and 
    falls in love with her. But Happy always gets his way and has Nate 
    beaten-up by his goons and absconds with Lily. Happy showers Lily 
    with diamonds, but still makes her display her wings in a glass cage 
    every night. Nate goes looking for her and when he finds Lily, she 
    walks right past him into the arms of Happy. It is all just a ruse, 
    of course, because Lily has feelings for Nate, too (At one time we 
    see Happy give Lily a good backhand to the face because her carnival 
    owner, played by Rhys Ifans, pays a visit to bring her back, but is 
    shot dead.). Lily and Nate escape together, but are trapped on the 
    roof of a building. Nate sacrifices himself by jumping off the 
    building, but Lily jumps after him and grabs him and they fly off. 
    What Nate sees on the ground in the middle of the desert in the 
    finale (you have to look real close) tells Nate and the viewers that 
    Lily may be an Angel after all. It's a satisfying conclusion to an 
    off-kilter film, directed and written by Mitch Glazer (his

    deadly. But not as deadly as a new oil refinery being dug nearby by 
    the seemingly obsessed boss Patrick (Drew Waters; <B><A HREF="hit_list_2011.htm">THE

    corporation, but his real reason is revealed in the finale. The 
    drilling goes down to the permafrost and releases large &quot;death 
    worms&quot; (that look like the ones in the Kevin Bacon/Fred Ward 
    film, I'm surprised they didn't sue). The worms (a mixture of above 
    average CGI and practical effects) begin feeding on the local 
    populace and a volunteer Peace Corps.-like nurse named Alicia 
    (Victoria Pratt; <B><A HREF="brotherhood _of_blood_2007.htm">BROTHERHOOD

    (Tiger Sheu) $300 for a ride (Alicia says to Daniel, &quot;You know 
    we are a non-profit charity, don't you?&quot;), only to get caught by 
    one of Daniel's enemies . Alicia is able to escape thanks to the 
    worms eating all Daniel's enemies (They have mouths that shoot out of 
    their mouths, which still makes me wonder why no legal action was 
    taken). When Daniel sees the worms with his own eyes, he knows he is 
    close to Genghis Khan's tomb, because legend says that giant worms 
    protect the tomb. Alicia makes it to the village and treats the 
    cholera, when Daniel pulls up and says the worms are real. Alicia and 
    Daniel have a combative relationship, but you know they are going to 
    fall in love. Long story short: Patrick found Ghenghis Khan's 
    treasure and wants it all to himself, taking Alicia hostage with his 
    assistant Tali (Ryan Manalansan). Daniel decides to stop Patrick and 
    destroy the oil refinery, leaving the treasure stay where it is. He 
    blows up the refinery and pieces of the gold treasure come flying 
    down on him and Alicia, making Daniel a millionaire. Alicia agrees to 
    take a cut of the treasure if Daniel donates it to charity. He drives 
    away (after giving Alicia back the $300) and the film ends. While

    dialogue and producer Andrew Stevens (who produced for Andrew Stevens 
    Entertainment and Cinetel Films) makes a cameo as a corporation 
    bigshot who gets eaten by the Queen worm (I had to do a double-take 
    since he looks so different now). Also, this film has one of the best 
    policemen, named Timur (George Kee Cheung; <B><A HREF="high_voltage_1997.htm">HIGH
     VOLTAGE</A></B> - 1997), who knows Daniel like a book and helps him 
    out of some tight spots (before he also becomes a meal for the

    scenes, especially when the worms swallow the people whole (another 
    litigious moment). Hell, this film is no big shake, but it is a 
    guilty pleasure that I can watch over and over and never grow bored.; <B><A HREF="hell_is_full_2010.htm">HELL

    (reportedly made for $2,500) with a difference. It is a series of 
    vignettes told in reverse chronological order, as we trace back to 
    &quot;patient zero&quot;, the original person to spread the plague, 
    caused by a flying blob from outer space (and, yes there is a 
    reference to <B><A HREF="blob_1958.htm">THE BLOB</A></B> [1958]). The 
    narrative structure of this film is very unusual and quite effective, 
    like a zombie version of <B><A HREF="memento_2000.htm">MEMENTO</A></B> 
    (2000) and, while the acting is amateurish, there's no denying that 
    the film holds your attention all the way through, the finale somehow 
    connecting to the first scene in the film (I'm still trying to figure 
    out how that happened!). Jack of all trades Steve Hudgins, who 
    directed/produced/wrote/edited/music/cinematography/acted and 
    practically did everything it takes to make a movie, should be given 
    more money to make a film with real actors, because he made something 
    really interesting here. Not a solid success, but still good enough 
    to be put in this category.</FONT></FONT></P>

    is a talky, but never boring, time travel tale thanks to the acting 
    talents of Lance Henriksen, who has never been better than he is 
    here. He portrays a man called Mr. Darnell, who wanders into new 
    psychologist Dr. Jason Pyatt's (Lathrop Walker) office and strikes up 
    a conversation. Darnell has been seeing Jason intermittently for the 
    past year and seems to know that Jason is having trouble at home.

    Evelyn (Melissa Roberts) is pregnant and he has lost interest in 
    being home, preferring to be with his best friend, Ovid Serrano 
    (Andrew Keegan; <B><A HREF="cruel_world_2005.htm">CRUEL WORLD</A></B> 
    - 2005), who recently was attacked in his job as a teacher, leaving a 
    huge scar and losing his sight in his right eye, and spending a lot 
    of time in his office, even though he has few clients and is wanting 
    for financial stability. Darnell tells Jason that he is actually from 
    the future and he invented a device that lets people travel back in 
    time, not physically, but they can see anywhere in the past on 
    TV-like screens. The government stepped in when people were using the 
    past's unknown revelations to better themselves in the future (Think 
    about learning peoples' and governments' best-kept secrets [something 
    no one should know about] and using them to their advantage) and the 
    Earth turned to shit in 2070, with constant wars and devastation. 
    Darnell tells Jason that he developed an actual time machine with his 
    partner to travel back in time to fix the mistakes he made, only he 
    is now being hunted by his partner because he doesn't believe Darnell 
    should fuck with the time line. Jason has a hard time believing 
    Darnell, even though he is a huge fan of the thought of time travel. 
    Because of the doctor/patient confidentiality, Jason cannot reveal 
    anything Darnell says about time travel, although he implies it to 
    Ovid over lunch and Ovid tells him to live for today, spend more time 
    with Evelyn and quit daydreaming because it is ruining his life. He's 
    about to become a father and Jason doesn't seem thrilled with the 
    idea. I'm going to leave the rest of the plot unrevealed, other than 
    to say that Lance Henriksen nails his role as Mr. Darnell, revealing 
    things about time travel that will really make you think (such as 
    parallel timelines and the past protecting itself from changing what 
    was meant to be). His acting is superb here and his role is large, 
    making it the most time he has spent in front of a camera since his 
    role as Frank Black on one of my favorite TV series, <B><A HREF="millennium_tv_series_1996-1999.htm">MILLENNIUM</A></B> 
    (1996 - 1999). Lance seems to be the king of cameos in recent genre 
    flicks, so it is nice to see him chew up the scenery with intelligent 
    dialogue and manages to make it totally believable. 
    Director/producer/screenwriter Nicholas Gyeney has made a very 
    intelligent film with little action and a lot of dialogue. Most 
    people will guess the surprise reveal long before the film ends, but 
    there's also a little twist at the end no one will see coming, 
    telling us that the past does, indeed, protect itself from changing. 
    This is not a film for everyone, but if you ever thought about time 
    travel and imagine things you would have done differently in the 
    past, you are bound to enjoy this movie. I know I 
    did.;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B><A HREF="second_apart_2010.htm">SECONDS

     DARK ORIGINALS</A> series shown for a limited time theatrically in 
    January 2011 and is probably the most somber. yet involving, horror 
    films in that series. The story is about a set of twins, Jonah and 
    Seth (played by real-life twins Edmund &amp; Gary Entin), who were 
    born 93 seconds apart. When they join hands, they can make anyone see 
    and do anything they want, including kill themselves. Now that they 
    are in Catholic high school. Jonah and Seth begin to kill people by 
    various means and film it with a video camera. The only one who has 
    any inkling what they are up to is Detective Lampkin (Orlando Jones, 
    in an effective performance), who has his own troubles, since he was 
    extremly burned on his body and face trying to save his deceased wife 
    from a house fire and has to go to the hospital for weekly 
    treatments. After making a priest at their school kill himself by 
    cutting an artery in his leg trying to remove an imaginary parasitic 
    worm (yes, you read that right), making one of their female 
    classmates cut her own throat with a shard of glass and having a 
    pedophile killed in a car accident involving a tractor trailer (among 
    other deaths and &quot;accidents&quot;, while filming it all), 
    Detective Lampkin visits the twins' parents and makes a discovery 
    that will take you by surprise (This after Lampkin slugs one of the 
    twins for making disparaging remarks and threats about his deceased 
    wife. You'll be happy when he does it, because the kid deserved 
    worse.). Things come to a boil (literally) when one of the twins 
    fucks his brother's girlfriend and Detective Lampkin makes the one 
    brother see what is actually going on in their own home (and it ain't 
    pretty). Director Antonio Negret (<A HREF="transit_2011.htm"><B>TRANSIT</B></A>

     co-production (filmed in English) that is part crime/part horror 
    story, but I found myself fascinated by the weirdness of it all. A 
    new police officer named Le Saint (Chris Briant, who also directed), 
    a recently returned Iraq War veteran, is assigned to meet an 
    informant by his boss Bernard (Terence Knox, who screams out his 
    lines, but if you stick around long enough, you will see this is not 
    bad acting), so he sets up an appointment to meet him at the long 
    abandoned Fort Goben, deep in the woods. For some reason, this does 
    not sit too well with Bernard, who screams out his displeeasure with 
    chosing this location in front of the whole squad. This only piques 
    Le Saint's interest and he goes there by himself to see what is 
    actually going on&nbsp; (Bernard tells him it's a place where drug 
    dealers and other lowlifes hang out and to just stay away from there) 
    and what he finds is quite shocking. He finds a man with a collection 
    of freshly decapitated heads and this man fondles them like they are 
    his toys. The man gets away from Le Saint, but word gets back to 
    Bernard that he was there (how could that have happened you may 
    ask?). To make a long story short (the film is a little overlong at 
    111 minutes), Bernard and a bunch of his police buddies use Fort 
    Goben as a meeting place where they begin their hunt for human prey 
    (a little <B><A HREF="most_dangerous_game_1932.htm">THE MOST 
    DANGEROUS GAME</A></B> thrown in) and bring back the heads for 
    trophys to the Fort. Le Saint goes on a one-man crusade to kill all 
    the participating hunters in the woods and achieves his goals, but 
    here are so many weird things that happen, that you will be left 
    scratching your head. Like the scene where one of the killer cops 
    catches a couple in the Fort and runs the barrel of the shotgun from 
    the mans's mouth down to his stomach (after punching the woman in the 
    face) before pulling the trigger (during this whole scene, you don't 
    know whether he is going to let them go or not) and giving the 
    innocent man both barrels in the gut. Another shootout shows sparks 
    shooting out of trees when there is a gunfight (I don't know if this 
    was done on purpose or by accident). It's an interesting movie that's 
    not a complete success, but it is just different enough to merit a 
    viewing. Screenwriter Michael Lehman (his only writing credit) must 
    have been under the influence of some hallucinatory mushrooms when he 
    wrote this screenplay, because it definitely defies description in 
    the normal sense. Watch it and you will know what I mean. And will 
    somebody please tell me what the ending is supposed to convey?; 
    Personally, I think director Victor Salva is a pedophile bastard who 
    will eventually burn in Hell, but the man can make some pretty good 
    films. <B><A HREF="rosewood_lane_2011.htm">ROSEWOOD LANE</A></B> 
    (2011) is a great little psycho-thriller about radio psychiatrist 
    Sonny Blake (Rose McGowan), who moves into her father's house when he 
    is found dead at the bottom of his basement stairs and no one will 
    buy the house for over a year. The police think it was an accident, 
    but slowly it becomes apparent to Sonny that the local paperboy, 
    Derek Barber (Daniel Ross Owens), was responsible (his eyes are 
    totally black due to a genetic condition and his mother gave him and 
    his siblings up for adoption). Soon, the paperboy (who the 
    neighborhood dogs chase every time they see him) begins killing 
    everyone who is close to Sonny, singing nursery rhymes, breaking into 
    her home, moving her knick-knacks around to show her he was there and 
    calling her on her radio show to tell her that he buried her 
    boyfriend, District Attorney Barrett Tanner (Sonny Marinelli), after 
    he overheard that Barrett was once buried alive when he was a child 
    and it was the scariest thing he ever experienced (The entire 
    sequence that happens after he makes that phone call is very, very, 
    tense; almost unbearable). Look for some pretty decent deaths (Ray 
    Wise gets the nastiest) and good turns by Rance Howard as Sonny's 
    scared neighbor, Lin Shaye and Bill Fagerbakke as put-upon parents, 
    Lauren Luna V&eacute;lez as Sonny's lesbian engineer/friend and 
    especially Ray Wise as&nbsp; Detective Briggs, who can't understand 
    why Sonny would move into the same house her father abused her in as 
    a child (She wrote a book explaining it in vivid detail). Also look 
    for appearances by Lesley-Anne Down as a child psychologist, Steve 
    Tom as the radio newscaster (You may not know the name, but you will 
    recognize his face) and Judson Mills (who plays a practical joke with 
    a crossbow bolt that will come back and haunt a certain character). 
    When we are led to believe that everything is finally over, Briggs' 
    partner, Detective Sabatino (Tom Tarantini, who is also great) makes 
    a discovery at the paperboy's funeral that will chill you to the bone 
    (and it makes perfect sense). Victor Salva is lucky I can separate 
    the artist from his art, because this is a taught thriller with 
    definite horror undertones. Worth a look; I'm a little sick and tired 
    of zombie comedies, but the Cuban/Spanish co-production <B><A HREF="juan_of_the_dead_2011.htm">JUAN
     OF THE DEAD</A></B> (&quot;Juan De Los Muertos&quot; - 2011) is 
    actually funny, as well as being a gorefest with political 
    undertones. Juan (Alexis D&iacute;az de Villegas) and his motley band 
    of friends and family must fend off a zombie outbreak in Cuba armed 
    only with a boat paddle, machetes and whatever weapons they can find 
    (but no guns). The English subtitles do a good job of expressing the 
    turmoil and comradery this group goes through, especially when Juan 
    is punked by his best friend Lazaro (Jorge Molina), who may or may 
    not have been bitten and tells Juan that he is gay and wants to 
    perform oral sex on him before he dies (Juan falls for it and drops 
    his pants, only for Lazaro to laugh his ass off. And so will you). 
    There are many funny bits, including a guy who only speaks English 
    and saves the group from certain doom, only for Lazaro to 
    accidentally kill him. Director/screenwriter Alejandro Brugu&eacute;s (<B><A HREF="abcs_of_death_2_2014.htm">ABCs
     OF DEATH 2</A></B> - 2014; the &quot;E Is For Equilibrium&quot; 
    segment) manages to keep the film moving at a fast pace, while 
    throwing in some sly anti-Castro political inferences into the mix. 
    The closing animation is also a hoot as are some of the 
    painful-looking deaths on view. If you have no problem with reading 
    English subtitles (and I wish everyone didn't), please watch this 
    film in the original language. I don't know if this is dubbed into 
    English, but a lot of mannerisms and sarcasm will be lost in the 
    translation. Watch this film the way it was intended and have a good 
    time; <B><A HREF="chained_2011.htm">CHAINED</A></B> (2011) is a 
    slow-burn of a thriller and since it was written/directed by David 
    Lynch's daughter, Jennifer Lynch (<B><A HREF="boxing_helena_1993.htm">BOXING
     HELENA</A></B> - 1993), you know what to expect: a 
    deliberately-paced, but beautifully-filmed, movie that is more style 
    over substance, but what style it has! Vincent D'Onofrio is Bob, a 
    lisping serial killer of young women who drives a taxi. He kills a 
    mother (Julia Ormond) and kidnaps her young son (Evan Bird), who he 
    renames &quot;Rabbit&quot; and has him do all his dirty work for him, 
    like clean the house, make him meals and go through the newspaper and 
    cut out articles about his killings and paste them into scrapbooks 
    (&quot;Everyone has to have a record of their achievements.&quot; is 
    Bob's explanation). If he displeases him in any way, Bob puts a 
    beating on Rabbit. Years pass and Rabbit is now full grown (and 
    portrayed by Eamon Farren; <B><A HREF="x_2011.htm">X</A></B> - 2011) 
    and is still kept prisoner (The chains of the title are of the 
    emotional kind). We learn that Bob is the way he is because his 
    abusive father made Bob fuck his own mother (!) and now Bob wants to 
    pass his serial killings ways to Rabbit. Needless to say, it doesn't 
    go too well, but there is an amazing final denouement that I doubt 
    anyone will see coming (I will not give it away here.). It makes 
    complete sense when you think about it after the film is well over 
    and is one of the few modern thrillers to actually take me by 
    surprise. D'Onofrio is amazing here and will instantly make you 
    forget about his role on <B><A HREF="law_and_order_criminal_intent_tv_series_2001-2011.htm">LAW
     &amp; ORDER: CRIMINAL INTENT</A></B> (2001 - 2011) and Lynch keeps 
    the mood creepy thanks to some matter-of-fact outbursts of violence 
    and a droning background score that is full of low-pitched 
    synthesizer noises (She learned from her father well and this was her 
    fourth feature-length directorial effort). If you like thrillers with 
    a distinctive edge, by all means search this one out.; <B><A HREF="ledge_2011.htm">THE

    was one of those films where I said to myself, &quot;Oh great, 
    another chick flick about vampires.&quot; before I watched it. After 
    all, it stars Alicia Silverstone, Krysten Ritter and was directed by 
    Amy Heckerling. Boy, was I fucking wrong. This is actually a 
    surprisingly funny, as well as emotional, film about two young 
    vampires living in New York and having to deal with all the changes 
    over the decades (and for Silverstone, centuries) that comes with 
    being eternal. It has many valid points that have bothered me (people 
    being too dependent of their electronic devices, talking in 
    shorthand, the changes &quot;Homeland Security&quot; has made on our 
    lives, etc.) and some truly heart-tugging scenes that will leave you 
    with a tear or two in your eyes (especially Silverstone's look back 
    at the changes in Times Square in the finale). There are great 
    performances from everyone, including Sigourney Weaver as the vampire 
    queen Cisserus who &quot;turned&quot; both of the girls, Richard 
    Lewis as an ACLU lawyer with a dying wife (Marilu Henner) and friend 
    of Silverstone, Wallace Shawn as Dr. Van Helsing, Justin Kirk as 
    vampire ladies' man Vadim and Malcolm McDowell as Vlad Tepish (who, 
    along with the girls, belongs to a support group for vampires who 
    refuse to drink human blood). Don't let the PG-13 Rating fool you 
    here. There are beheadings, animals being sucked of their blood, neck 
    biting and other bloody mayhem, usually used for comic effect. Try 
    it. You just may like it; I can see why <B><A HREF="pact_2011.htm">THE

    only got to see the film on the big screen on a limited one week 
    theatrical/VOD release, so it never caught on like it did in merry

    in their mother Jessica's (Petra Wright) house. Annie refuses, but 
    when Nichole disappears, Annie, her cousin Liz (Kathleen Rose 
    Perkins) and Nichole's young daughter Eva (Dakota Bright), go to the 
    house to see if they can find Nichole. (As we see from the opening 
    shot of the film, Annie has a condition known as complete 
    heterochromia iridum [literally &quot;different colored iris&quot;]. 
    Its cause is unknown, but many experts believe it might result from a 
    lack of genetic diversity.) Right from the start we know Nichole &amp;
     Annie's mother was a bitch with a capital &quot;C&quot;. because 
    there is not one nice memory about her in Annie's memories. (She 
    light's up a cigarette when Mother Jessica wouldn't allow it in the 
    house when she was alive, and immediately puts it out because she 
    still fears her mother, saying the cigarette doesn't &quot;taste 
    right&quot;). That night, some strange force throws Annie around the 
    house like a ragdoll, so she runs out of the house and hears a crying 
    Eva. She runs back into the house, where she is thrown around some 
    more and saves Eva, but Liz is missing. We then see Annie being 
    interviewed by Detective Creek (Casper Van Dien), who doesn't know 
    what to make of her story, but Nichole and Liz are actually missing. 
    Annie mans-up (or womans-up in this case) and goes back to the house, 
    where she sees some very scary things. Detective Creek shows up at 
    the house and they both find a room that Annie never saw before; it 
    is actually&nbsp; a behind-the-walls secret passage, where somebody 
    could watch every room in the house with some well-placed holes. 
    Annie hires psychic Stevie (Haley Hudson) and her handler Giles (Sam 
    Ball) to check out the house and when Stevie walks by one of the 
    rooms she goes crazy, mentioning that she is sorry what Annie had to 
    go through all her childhood until she was 16, an unknown person 
    named &quot;Judas&quot; and the repeats over and over again, 
    &quot;KILL IT! KILL IT!&quot; while being pulled by some unknown 
    force, which Giles and Annie free her from. Stevie refuses to say 
    anything else, while Giles smacks Annie across the face and puts 
    Stevie into a car and takes off. Annie finds some interesting photos 
    in the town's history museum where she discovers her mother had a 
    brother, Charles Barlow (Mark Steger), whom she has never met. 
    Meanwhile Detective Creek is taking pictures of the house's inside 
    (the lens of the camera can see things human eyes can't) and then he 
    is fatally stabbed in the neck by someone as the Detective's blood 
    spurts all over the kitchen floor. Like in all horror films of this 
    type, Annie puts a makeshift Ouija board together by drawing it on 
    the house's floor, using her family crucifix necklace heirloom as a 
    planchette. After asking it some pertinent questions and getting some 
    important answers, Annie goes on a trip of discovery through the 
    house and to say it is not pleasant is an understatement. But she 
    discovers the secret of &quot;Judas&quot; and kills it and adopts Eva 
    as her own, finding out why she has heterochromia iridum, and living 
    in her mother's house in peace (or are they?). Director/screenwriter 
    Nicholas McCarthy (<B><A HREF="at_the_devils_door_2013.htm">AT THE 
    DEVIL'S DOOR</A></B> - 2013) made this feature from an award-winning 
    short he made the same year under the same title. It is full of 
    atmosphere and some true scares, not jump scares, something I was 
    getting sick of. Made on the small budget of $400,000, it made 18 
    times its budget in only one week before being dumped on home video, 
    disc and pay cable. There was a sequel made, <B><A HREF="pact_2_2014.htm">THE
     PACT II</A></B> (2014), but without McCarthy's participation (but 
    Caity Lotz returned to star) and it can be considered one of the most 
    disappointing sequels of the New Millennium. Watch this film a second 
    time instead.;&nbsp; <B><A HREF="wake_wood_2011.htm">WAKE WOOD</A></B> 
    (2011) is one of the first batch of films co-produced by the revived 
    Hammer Films Productions (To an old fogey like me, it is great to see 
    the Hammer logo on some new films!) and while it's not perfect, it is 
    still a crackling good chiller. Two parents, Patrick and Louise 
    (Aiden Gillen, Eva Birthistle), are grieving over the death of their 
    young daughter Alice (Ella Connolly) when she is attacked and killed 
    by a mad dog. They move to the titled town, a centuries-old small 
    English village which has a secret: They are able to bring back the 
    dead, but for only three days. After the three days are up, the body 
    must be reburied. Arthur (an excellent Timothy Spall, who has a face 
    that can break mirrors, but he has talent to spare), the leader of 
    the town, offers to give Patrick and Louise the chance to say goodbye 
    to Alice properly by performing the Pagan ritual and giving them 
    three days with their daughter. The only problem is, after the three 
    days are up, Alice doesn't want to be reburied and starts a murderous 
    rampage. What happens next is best for the viewer to discover, but it 
    is heartbreaking and the finale will leave you (especially those who 
    like to speculate) wondering what will happen next. Hammer Films was 
    also involved with two other good horror films: <B><A HREF="let_me_in_2010.htm">LET
     ME IN</A></B> (2010), a remake of the Swedish vampire film <B><A HREF="let_the_right_one_in_2008.htm">LET

    goosebump-inducing finale; <B><A HREF="attack_the_block_2011.htm">ATTACK
     THE BLOCK</A></B> (2011) is a really good alien invasion film unlike 
    any other that you have ever seen. A gang of South London hooligans 
    mug a young lady just when an alien attack on the hooligan's block 
    begins. The lady helps the gang of young thieves defeat the aliens 
    (who are truly frightening creations with their flourescent teeth and 
    black fur), as the visitors from outer space kill everyone in the 
    apartment tenement where the gang lives. Lots of action, plenty of 
    humor (Nick Frost [<B><A HREF="shaun_of_the_dead_2003.htm">SHAUN OF 
    THE DEAD</A></B> - 2003; <B><A HREF="paul_2011.htm">PAUL</A></B> - 
    2011] is the building's pot dealer) and some really intense alien 
    attack scenes differentiate this from most modern horror films. I 
    can't wait to see what freshman feature film director Joe Cornish (a 
    British TV series director) does next. The fact that most of the kids 
    that make up the gang never acted before (and they are great, 
    although some of them are hard to understand [use the English 
    Subtitles option on your DVD or Blu-Ray]) adds plenty of realism to 
    the proceedings; <B><A HREF="hobo_with_a_shotgun_2011.htm">HOBO WITH 
    A SHOTGUN</A></B> (2011), a film that really has truth in the title. 
    The hobo (a grizzled Rutger Hauer) buys a shotgun and begins blowing 
    away anyone associated with town crimelord The Drake (an 
    over-reaching Brian Downey) while trying to protect town hooker Abby 
    (Molly Dunsworth). The film is full of unrated gore, including, 
    blown-off heads and penises, a decapitation by rope, a manhole cover 
    collar and a motorcycle (it must be seen to be believed), lots of 
    bloody bullet squibs, a busload of children burned alive with a flame 
    thrower (there's an inspired bit later on using the burned-out bus), 
    slicing the hobo's back with ice skates, the obliteration of a body 
    with shotgun blasts and other gory mayhem. Everyone overacts here, 
    but that is part of the film's charm. It's like a Troma film with a 
    bigger budget and better stars and looks more like an 80's 
    action/horror film, something which it purposely strived for (the 
    film is based on a fake trailer shown during the <B><A HREF="grindhouse_2007.htm">GRINDHOUSE</A></B>

    films in years. When the time traveler (Neil McDonough; <B><A HREF="hitcher_2007.htm">THE

    everyone else who made his childhood a nightmare) and leaves behind 
    his journal (and a piece of cloth that can't be identified) that 
    contains a hit list of potential victims, Gooding gets the idea of 
    befriending the time traveler as a boy, who is in an orphanage and is 
    different from all the other kids (wait until you catch a gander at 
    the kid's private &quot;zoo&quot;!). When the time traveler returns 
    for his journal and retrieves it (just as the cops were about to come 
    to Gooding's house; now he is a suspect since he knows the names of 
    people before they are being murdered), Gooding must trick him to 
    meet himself as a boy. The film has plenty of plot holes (especially 
    concerning time travel), but is highly watchable and McDonough (and 
    those bright blue eyes) adds a sense of class to the proceedings; 
    Speaking of Cuba Gooding Jr., his performance as the extremely bad 
    guy in <B><A HREF="hit_list_2011.htm">THE HIT LIST</A></B> (2011) is 
    pretty good. The plot concerns strangers Gooding and Cole Hauser (<B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Cave 2005">THE
     CAVE</A></B> - 2005) getting drunk in a bar and making a list of 
    people they would like to see dead. To Hauser's surprise, the people 
    he put on the list start turning up dead, with Gooding performing the 
    deeds. The police start looking at Hauser as the murderer, finding 
    his bar story hard to swallow, so he has to find a way to stop 
    Gooding. The finale, which takes place at a police station, is about 
    as violent as you can get in a film and still have an R-Rating. 
    Pretty entertaining stuff. Not quite as good as <B><A HREF="ticking_clock_2011.htm">TICKING

    adding extra gore and violence, including exploding bodies). Stay

    Samuel L. Jackson as Foley, a con man who just got out of prison

    soon as he gets out, he is approched by Ethan (Luke Kirby), the son

    million dollar con called &quot;The Samaritan&quot;. He also falls in 
    love with Iris (Ruth Negga), who is young enough to be his daughter. 
    Ethan bribes Foley with a secret that is almost too hard for Foley to

    pimps and a violent crime lord. What follows next is a non-stop 
    barrage of gunfights, martial arts combat and double-crosses that I 
    guarantee will hold your attention throughout. Available in 
    English-dubbed or subtitled versions (go for the subtitled; there's

     PHILLY KID</A></B> (2011) would actually be a run-of-the-mill 
    actioner if it wasn't for the fact that there are characters here 
    that you actually care about. Dillon (Wes Chatham), a former NCAA 
    wrestler convicted of manslaughter, is paroled from prison after ten 
    years. He gets a job at a liquor store, but his best friend Jake 
    (Devon Sawa) owes the local loanshark $30,000, so Dillon agrees to 
    fight in three mixed martial arts fights to pay off Jake's debt, but 
    only if he wins the three matches. After the first fight (which he 
    wins), Dillon is taken under the wings of trainer LA Jim (the always 
    good Neal McDonough), who teaches him the fighting part of the bouts. 
    Dillon has two cops that are always harassing him and want him to 
    throw the third fight, but he also has a very understanding parole 
    officer (a rarity in films) who helps Dillon as much as Dillon helps 
    him and Jake's sister Amy (Sarah Butler) as his girlfriend. While 
    there is plenty of ring action going on in this film, there is also a 
    lot of characterization (thanks to screenwriter Adam Mervis), which 
    makes this film a winner. Directed by Jason Connery (<B><A HREF="devils_tomb_2008.htm">THE

    (2011) is one of those low-budget thrillers that comes out of nowhere 
    and then blows you away. Insurance investigator Bryan Spikes 
    (writer/executive producer Mark Bierlein) stumbles upon a series of 
    murders in Detroit, falls in love with barmaid Heather (Mena Suvari) 
    and then ends up with his hands and legs chained, a hood thrown over 
    his head and tossed into a river, where he is eventually framed for 
    all the murders by the actual killers and it make the front pages of 
    all the local newspapers. One year passes and a mysterious man named

    mind. He takes an apartment next to clingy neighbor Tom Lipnity (Tom 
    Arnold, who is great here), a former sharpshooter for the military 
    who definitely has mental problems. As Alex begins killing all those 
    involved with Bryan's murder (he is saved a couple of times by Tom's 
    sharpshooting skills), it becomes clear that Alex is more than he 
    seems. He is actually Bryan Spikes (it is one of the best 
    transformations I have ever seen without the use of prosthetics) and 
    once he is done with his mission, he reveals his true identity to 
    Heather (how he does it is very touching) and they continue their 
    romance. Filled with scenes of ultra-bloody violence (head shots are 
    plentiful), director/co-producer Lance K.R. Kawas (<B><A HREF="silent_scream_2005.htm">SILENT

    capacity on a film called <B><A HREF="street_boss_2009.htm">STREET BOSS</A></B>

    looking to kill Bigfoot for a hefty reward. The acting stinks and the 
    stabs at comedy work about 50% of the time (the funniest is when Dirk 
    gets raped by the giant-penised Bigfoot while wearing a gorilla suit, 
    or the many times Prudence says she is three credits away from 
    passing some class in college), but this is 100 times better than

    blow up parts of England with bombs. Ash (Abhin Galeya), the 
    British-born head of the terrorist cell, has problems with his

    its first week in over 2400 theaters, even though it was in 3D and 
    directed by Chris Gorak, who gave us the highly underrated <B><A HREF="right_at_your_door_2006.htm">RIGHT
     AT YOUR DOOR</A></B> - 2006). Emile Hirsch and best friend Max 
    Minghella, who have developed a Facebook-like app and travel to 
    Moscow, where they hope to get financing for the app. After finding 
    out that they have been betrayed by another partner, they have much 
    worse things to deal with. The Earth is suddenly attacked by an army 
    of invisible aliens, that can only be seen when they are near 
    electrical devices. When one of them touches you, you disintegrate (a 
    great effect). Suddenly Hirsch, his best friend and a couple of 
    American women they meet at a bar must try to survive as strangers in 
    a strange land, with aliens hot on their heels. Moscow is depicted as 
    a town just like any other, only with a language difference that 
    impedes our heroes every now and then. They run into a crazy Russian 
    electrician who has invented a portable weapon that can destroy the 
    aliens and Hirsch takes it with him as the ever-increasing (and then 
    ever-decreasing) group try to make it to a submarine on its way to 
    the United States. There are plenty of nail-biting scenes that could 
    have made better if the film wasn't Rated PG-13 (it was made for the 
    Christmas crowd, after all), but is is still an involving sci-fi tale 
    that shows that every town has their heroes (lots of them) and their 
    villians. I guess audiences weren't in the mood to see aliens invade 
    Earth at Christmas time, but that should not stop you from watching 
    it now. We really don't get a really good look at the aliens, but 
    they blow up real good and get their share of people while they 
    attack. Better than the disappointing receipts say it is.</FONT></FONT></P>

     DTV Genre Films Part 8 (continued): <B><A HREF="manborg_2011.htm">MANBORG</A></B><A NAME="Manborg"></A> 
    (2011) Is the first theatrical film from the Canadian collective 
    known as &quot;Astron-6&quot; and it is a crazy mix of extremely 
    cheap CGI and stop-motion animation with extreme gore that's a 
    send-up of <B><A HREF="robocop_1987.htm">ROBOCOP</A></B> (1987) and 
    the Post-Apocalypse genre. In the far-off future, an evil genius 
    called Draculon (Adam Brooks) has unleashed the demons from hell and 
    has wiped out billions of human beings, hoping to turn the Earth into 
    Hell's new home. A group of rebels are fighting Draculon and his 
    killborg soldiers, when an unnamed human soldier (Matthew Kennedy) 
    sees his brother <A HREF="manborg_2011.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/manborg dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Sarge
     (Ivan Henwood), graphically killed by Draculon and vows vengeance, 
    but before he can get it, Draculon kills him...or so he thought. The 
    soldier wakes up further in the future, part man, part cyborg, dubbed 
    &quot;Manborg&quot;, not knowing who he is or what he is doing here. 
    He is captured by Draculon's killborg cops and brought to a cell 
    containing other human survivors , including the Oriental &quot;#1 
    Man&quot; (Ludwig Lee, who is hilariously overdubbed by someone 
    definitely not Oriental!), the illiterate &quot;Justice&quot; (Conor 
    Sweeney, who speaks with an Australian accent, his tribute to <B><A HREF="mad_max_1979.htm">MAD
     MAX</A></B> [1979]!) and his sister Mina (Meredith Sweeney). 
    Draculon's number one henchman, the Baron (co-screenwriter Jeremy 
    Gillespie), is pissed off at #1 Man because he tried to escape and 
    ripped out the Baron's eyes in the process (he has since had them 
    replaced with mechanical models), so he has the human captives enter 
    an arena and battle his best killborg fighters, but the humans keep 
    winning, which is beginning to piss-off Draculon. It doesn't help 
    that the Baron has fallen in love with Mina and gets tongue-tied 
    every time he sees her! There's also Doctor Scorpius (Adam Brooks 
    again), a human scientist who is forced to work with Draculon to 
    create better soldiers, but he also harbors a secret: he is the one 
    who created Manborg for the sole purpose of destroying Draculon and 
    bringing the Earth back to humans. Unfortunately, Manborg is a real 
    klutz, unable to control the many advanced weapons attached to his 
    metal frame (he almost kills Mina during an arena battle with one of 
    those weapons!), until Doctor Scorpius tells him the truth and helps 
    him control the weapons like a champion. The rest of the film is 
    non-stop death and yuks, as Manborg (who talks to everyone like a 
    deaf person!) and his motley band of humans win every battle, even 
    though Justice doesn't know how to read (it almost gets them all 
    killed because he doesn't know how to spell &quot;grenade&quot;!), 
    and then set their sights on Draculon. While not rocket science, this 
    cheap, inventive film will have you laughing out loud during several 
    scenes, especially the way Manborg replies to questions asked of him. 
    Director/producer/co-screenwriter Steven Kostanski has made a film 
    that defies description (I have done the best I can), but there's no 
    denying that it has a certain energy that can't be overlooked. Just a 
    word of warning: If you hate cheap CGI effects, you are going to get 
    a lot of it here, but nearly all of it is dealt with in a comical 
    way. There is also a ton of graphic gore, as heads are ripped off, 
    bodies blown apart and other very bloody effects, also done cheaply. 
    But cheap doesn't mean bad, as you will see when watching this farce. 
    Astron-6 would later make the weird-beyond-belief <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#FathersDay2011">FATHER'S
     DAY</A></B> (2011) and the excellent <B><A HREF="#Editor2014">THE EDITOR</A></B> 
    (2014), two other films that should be on your Must-See list. I wish 
    Astron-6 would make their short film, <B>BIO-COP</B> (the fake 
    trailer is on both the <A HREF="http://www.darkskyfilms.com">Dark Sky Films</A> 
    DVD and the Amazon Prime streaming version) into a feature-length 
    film (<B>MANBORG</B> ticks in at slightly over 61 minutes), because 
    it caused non-stop laughter (at least in me) with the set-up: A cop 
    dies and begins to decompose, but no one seems to notice except him, 
    who begs everyone to kill him because he is in so much pain! He is 
    still on the police force and must solve a series of murders that 
    could be related to his condition. This sounds like a winning film to 
    me!; <B><A HREF="moleman_of_belmont_avenue_2011.htm">THE MOLEMAN OF 
    BELMONT AVENUE</A></B> (2011) is a pretty funny independent horror 
    comedy that doesn't get the notice it deserves. Directors/writers 
    Mike Bradecich &amp;John LaFlamboy star as Marion &amp; Jarmon Mugg, 
    two slacker brothers who inherited an apartment building in Chicago 
    from their dead mother. The place is falling apart, as the brothers 
    have turned off the furnace and are stealing electricity from a 
    nearby church in order to save money. The building is rapidly losing 
    residents due to the cost cutting and the building slowly falling 
    apart from neglect and the building even has a bar in the basement 
    that is always empty, except for barmaid Abby (Cat Bernier), who 
    Marion has a secret romantic interest in. The building has a bigger 
    problem, though. All the residents' pets turn up missing and when the 
    brothers realize that there is a creature in their building who is 
    grabbing the pets through the heating vents and eating them, they try 
    to kill it without telling the remaining residents, which includes 
    old lady Mrs. Habershackle (Mary Seibel) sexual deviate Hezekiah 
    Confab (Robert Englund, the only &quot;name&quot; actor in the cast), 
    hooker Molly (Dana DeLorenzo), stoner Paulie (T.J. Jagodowski, who is 
    very funny) and a few others.&nbsp; Of course, they fail miserably 
    and when the &quot;Moleman&quot; (Justin DiGiacomo) runs out of pets 
    to eat, it turns to the residents as its latest meals. While the plot 
    may sound old hat, it's the dialogue between the two brothers that is 
    special and downright hilarious. Take my word for it, you have to 
    hear it to appreciate it, as they both have conversations with each 
    other that is full of comical moments, some of which will have you 
    laughing out loud. There is also an extended cameo from former SNL'er 
    Tim Kazurinsky that will have you pissing in your pants, it is so 
    funny. I usually don't like horror comedies, but this one actually 
    worked for me. It is full of nudity, bits of gore and really funny 
    dialogue, especially the quick asides from the brothers. Highly 
    recommended!; <B><A HREF="crawlspace_2011.htm">CRAWLSPACE</A></B> 
    (2011) is a title used on a lot in horror films, but this version, 
    directed and co-written by Josh Stolberg (the screenwriter of <B><A HREF="piranha_2010.htm">PIRANHA
     3D</A></B> - 2010), ups the ante in clever and gory deaths to make a 
    compelling little scare flick. Steven Weber stars as the well-hidden 
    tenant of the house he use to live in when his family died. He hides 
    in the attic when a new family, headed by father Jonathan Silverman, 
    move in and Weber will kill anyone that gets in his way to make 
    Silverman's teenage daughter and young son part of his new family. 
    The plot may be old hat (it's an unofficial remake of the <A HREF="crawlspace_1986.htm">1986
     Klaus Kinski movie of the same name</A>), but Steven Weber is 
    efficiently creepy as a man who will do anything to get a new family. 
    Look for David Koechner in a cameo as an exterminator who gets killed 
    by Weber in an inventive way when he discovers the hiding place in 
    the attic. Not a bad little horror flick if you are in the right 
    state of mind and the final scene leaves the film wide open for a 
    sequel; You have been seeing Jason Statham's name a lot in this 
    section and for good reason: The man makes a shitload of films. <B><A HREF="safe_2011.htm">SAFE</A></B> 
    (2011) is one of his better actioners (that has a double meaning), 
    thanks to the plentiful fisticuffs and gunfights, as well as an 
    unusual plot. Statham portrays ex-New York City cop Luke Wright, who 
    now participates im MMA-style fighting in New Jersey. After not 
    throwing a fight in the second round, it pisses off Russian kingpin 
    Emile Docheski (S&aacute;ndor T&eacute;csy), who lost a million 
    dollars betting on the fight. To get back at Luke, Emile sends his 
    son, Vassily (Joseph Sikora; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Gacy">GACY</A></B> 
    - 2003), and some other Russian thugs to kill Luke's wife, which they 
    do. Vassily tells Luke that he is not going to kill him now, but he 
    will have to look over his shoulder for the rest of his life (however 
    long Vassily decides it will be). Luke becomes a bum on the streets 
    of NYC and is recognized by corrupt cop Captain Wolf (Robert John 
    Burke of <B><A HREF="thinner_1996.htm">THINNER</A></B> - 1996; and 
    TV's <B><A HREF="law_and_order_special_victims_unit_tv_series.htm">LAW
     &amp; ORDER: SVU</A></B> [as ex-IAB Officer Ed Tucker, who is now 
    Olivia Benson's boyfriend!]) and his squad of equally corrupt 
    officers, who proceed to beat the shit out of him. Meanwhile, a young 
    girl named Mei (Catherine Chan). who is a super-genius and remembers 
    everything she sees, especially numbers, is kidnapped from her China 
    home town and brought to New York, where Triad leader Han Jiao (the 
    always welcome James Hong; <B><A HREF="vineyard_1989.htm">THE VINEYARD</A></B> 
    - 1989) needs two sets of long numbers in her head. Both numbers open 
    safes: One containing $50 million and the other containing a disc 
    that contains the names of all U.S. agents abroad. The Russians are 
    also interested in the numbers, so they kidnap Mei from the Chinese, 
    but she escapes. Luke is about to step in front of a subway car to 
    end his life when he sees the Russians chasing Mei on a subway train. 
    Luke decides to save her, which leads to a good fight/shootout in a 
    subway car and Luke grabs Mei and takes her with him. At first Mei 
    doesn't trust Luke, but she begins to warm up to him and tells him 
    about the numbers and writes them down for him. Meanwhile, shifty 
    Mayor Tremello of NYC (Chris Sarandon; <B><A HREF="fright_night_1985.htm">FRIGHT
     NIGHT</A></B> - 1985), who is working with Captain Wolf, play the 
    Chinese and the Russians off of each other. Whomever gives them the 
    best deal gets the girl. But not if Luke has anything to do with it. 
    I'll leave the rest for you to discover, but expect plenty of 
    hand-to-hand combat, gunfights and other acts of violence. The film 
    is full of great actors, also including Anson Mount (who suffers an 
    unexpected death), James Lee (as Han Jiao's son, who tells Mei he is 
    her new father although he has no trouble making her watch people 
    die) and<A HREF="bloodsuckers_handbook_2011.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bloodsucker's handbook 2011 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="138" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    James Colby as Detective Mears, one of Captain Wolf's corrupt 
    detectives. Director/screenwriter Boaz Yakin (<B><A HREF="remember_the_titans_2000.htm">REMEMBER
     THE TITANS</A></B> - 2000) keeps things moving at a quick clip and 
    the action never stops once the premise is set. Another Statham 
    winner.; Every once in a while I take a chance on watching a film I 
    know absolutely nothing about, picking it out to watch based only on 
    its synopsis and title. Such is the case of <B><A HREF="bloodsuckers_handbook_2011.htm">BLOODSUCKER'S
     HANDBOOK</A></B> (originally titled <B><A HREF="bloodsuckers_handbook_2011.htm#Enchiridion">ENCHIRIDION</A></B> 
    - 2011), which I found on Amazon Prime. This film is not for 
    everyone, but those interested in arthouse horror will find much to 
    like here. Based in some alternate mid-1960's Earth, where dogs and 
    other animals walk on two feet and speak English (!), interacting 
    with humans on a level playing field, this film tells the story of a 
    college priest, Noah (Cory W. Ahre), who is contacted by Federal 
    Agents to interview a vampire they have captured named Condu (an 
    excellent Joel Jeremy Herrera) and to translate the Latin handbook he 
    has created, which tells his life story and the entire story of how 
    vampires were created (told using G.I. Joe-like action figures in 
    stop-motion animation!). Condu takes a liking to Father Noah and 
    begins messing with his head. You see, Father Noah is having an 
    affair with a college girl named Edie (Jessica Bell), which weighs 
    heavily on his mind. When Condu escapes captivity, he kidnaps Edie 
    and sends Father Noah on a trip to save her that he will never 
    forget, Noah hiring a canine private detective to help find her. The 
    journey Condu sends him on makes Father Noah realize that his life is 
    not perfect; as a matter of fact, many things in his life may not 
    have happened at all. Director/producer/screenwriter Mark Beal has 
    created a low-budget film that just swims in weirdness (He wants you 
    to <A HREF="bloodsuckers_handbook_2011.htm#EmbraceThe Weird">&quot;Embrace
     The Weird&quot;</A>) and the scenes showing Father Noel walking with 
    a stop-motion dog detective in a trenchcoat will have you smiling 
    ear-to-ear, as will the car chase between a baboon and the dog 
    detective! This may be a little too slowly paced for some people, but 
    for me it was manna from Heaven. Beal made a prequel of sorts, the 
    sci-fi tinged <B><A HREF="bloodsuckers_planet_2019.htm">BLOODSUCKER'S PLANET</A></B> 
    (2019), that is just as weird, but not as satisfying as this film. In 
    any case, if arthouse horror films interest you, I would search both 
    of them out (As of this writing [March 02, 2020], both are available 
    on Amazon Prime).;<A NAME="BloodyBibleCamp2011"></A> <B><A HREF="bloody_bloody_bible_camp_2011.htm">BLOODY
     BLOODY BIBLE CAMP</A></B> (2011) may not be for everyone, as it is a 
    sometimes very funny, sometimes very juvenile, look at Christianity 
    and religion in general, but I put it in the good category for its 
    goofy performances and very gory killings. In 1977, a serial killer, 
    known as Sister Mary Chopper, kills everyone at the Happy Day Bible 
    Camp, all except for Millie (Ivet Corvea). We then switch to 1984, 
    where Father Richard Cummings ([&quot;Dick Cummings&quot;, Get it?] 
    Reggie Bannister; <B><A HREF="phantasm_1979.htm">PHANTASM</A></B> - 
    1979; also one of the Producers; He sings and plays guitar to a 
    religious song here [which he wrote on the spot], where he rhymes 
    &quot;keener' with &quot;weiner&quot;!) is taking a group of 
    Bible-thumpers to the camp, one of them being Millie, who no one 
    knows was the only survivor of the massacre years earlier (or so we 
    thought). These cliched people are not Bible-thumpers at all, except 
    for the overweight Timmy (Christopher Raff), who eats, breathes and 
    lives for Jesus. They are your normal horny people, even Millie, who 
    has turned lesbian, after realizing that her ex-boyfriend Dwayne 
    (Jeff Dylan Graham; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HomeSick2007">HOME SICK</A></B> 
    - 2007) also survived the massacre, but he was turned into a drooling 
    retard after Sister Mary Chopper sliced up his face and impaled his 
    brain with her crucifix that is also a knife. It's not long before 
    everyone at the camp is attacked and killed by Sister Mary Chopper. 
    Brother Zeke (Jay Fields, in a ridiculously funny wig) has his head 
    cut off with an axe; horndog Tad (Matthew Aiden) has his stomach 
    sliced open with the same axe, his innards spilling to the ground; 
    the pretty dumb and stuck-up Brittany (Jessica Sonneborn) has the 
    cricifix/knife shoved in her mouth while she is sleeping (my guess is 
    that she swallows!), Timmy has <A HREF="bloody_bloody_bible_camp_2011.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bloody bloody bible camp poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>a
     cinderblock dropped on his head, squashing it like a grape, and so 
    forth, until only Father Cummings and Millie are alive. Can they 
    defeat Sister Mary Chopper, who is revealed to be transvestite Eugene 
    (Tim Sullivan, the director of <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Two Thou 1 Maniacs">2001
     MANIACS</A></B> - 2005 and <B><A HREF="driftwood_2006.htm">DRIFTWOOD</A></B> 
    - 2006), who, as a young boy, was severely punished by one-eyed nun 
    Mother Mary (played by Reggie Bannister's wife, Gigi Bannister)? 
    Maybe the appearance of Jesus (Ron Jeremy, the Hedgehog of all 
    people!) can help them? As Jesus would say, &quot;Heaven is for 
    everyone...except you.&quot; While the plot is no great shakes, it's 
    the performances here that count. Christopher Raff as Timmy is a hoot 
    and a half, such as the scene where he gets a boner when Tad and 
    Vance (Troy Guthrie) start talking about naked women. He runs out of 
    the room yelling that Jesus will hate him for getting a boner 
    (&#147;I&#146;m sorry Jesus! Please take this sinful boner 
    away!&#148;), but Father Cummings tells him that he has a boner for 
    Jesus (there are many other pedophile and homosexual jokes in this 
    film)! Father Cummings also puts on a game show where all the 
    questions are religious in nature and Timmy answers all of them 
    before anyone else can, not that they would know the answers, because 
    all of them have sex on their minds, even Millie, who has the hots 
    for punker Jennifer (Deborah Venegas). But the real discovery of this 
    film is Elissa Dowling (the lousy <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Bonejangles16">BONEJANGLES</A></B> 
    [2016], also with Reggie Bannister) as Betty, a ditsy blonde who is 
    about as brainless as a person can get. Her performance is guaranteed 
    to put a smile on your face, even when she is killed in a manner 
    befitting her screwy personality. Director/co-screenwriter Vito 
    Trabucco has fashioned a film that has a very nice gloss to it, even 
    though it was obviously made with a very limited budget. The kills 
    are appropriately gory (Done by Marcus Koch, the director of <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#a100Tears2007">100
     TEARS</A></B> - 2007, so you know they are juicy. I had to rewind 
    Timmy's death a couple of time to see how they did it!) and the 
    overacting by the cast fits this movie perfectly. Hey, this isn't 
    brain surgery, just a very funny horror comedy, thanks, in most part, 
    to the funny characters (There's a scene early in the film where a 
    man is taking one of the most painful and funny shits ever committed 
    to celluloid! I'm a sucker for toilet humor.). A sequel is supposedly 
    coming in 2022, with Trabucco attached to direct.;&nbsp; <B><A HREF="brass_teapot_2011.htm">THE
     BRASS TEAPOT</A></B> (2011) has a harmless title, but behind it 
    hides a devilish black comedy about what people will do for money. A 
    down-on-their-luck couple (Juno Temple, Michael Angarano) find an 
    ancient brass teapot at a garage sale and decide to buy it, only to 
    discover that the teapot will dispense money in exchange for pain. 
    The more the suffering, the greater amount it spits out. At first 
    they inflict small pain on themselves, by playing S&amp;M games in 
    bed and hitting their hands with hammers, but they become greedy and 
    start inflicting pain on other people, including some of their 
    neighbors (some who deserve it). A couple of Orthodox Jews, who once 
    owned the teapot (but don't want it anymore), steal all the couple's 
    money, only for the couple to discover that the teapot demands more 
    pain than they are willing to give, as it now only spits out one and 
    five dollar bills. There are shootouts (where money comes flying out 
    of the teapot) unsuccessful suicide attempts and other psychological 
    and physical pain on view, but I'm happy to report this is the type 
    of film with a happy ending and not one of those films where the 
    basically good couple pay for their bad choices. Like I said in the 
    beginning, the title may be harmless, but the film is a cutting black 
    comedy full of violence. Director Ramaa Mosley (her feature film 
    debut and based on her 2007 short of the same name) and screenwriter 
    Tim Macy have turned out a surprisingly wicked fairy tale for adults. 
    Highly recommended. This was one of those small independent films 
    (shot for less than $900,000) that played in two theaters for a week 
    while playing simultaneously on VOD before quickly showing up on Showtime;<A NAME="Diablo2011"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="diablo_2011.htm">DIABLO</A></B> (2011) is a very funny 
    Argentina crime comedy with a lot to recommend. Jewish champion boxer 
    Marcos Wainsberg (a fantastic Juan Palomino), dubbed &quot;The Inca 
    of the Sinai&quot;, kills his opponent in the boxing ring with a 
    single punch, so he tries to retire from the profession, because all 
    anyone remembers about him is that he killed another boxer (his agent 
    tried to blame the death on a pre-existing medical condition, but no 
    one believes it). He basically becomes a hermit in his own house, 
    losing the only girl who ever loved him and smoking way too much. His 
    life is about to change drastically. His ex calls him on the phone

    him from doing it. The old man is a crime kingpin and his daughter is 
    his successor. But what could be Hugo's connection to them?&nbsp; 
    Marcos sends Hugo to the store to buy cleaning supplies, so Marcos 
    makes himself a tasty dish for lunch, consisting of fried vegetables 
    and liver he finds in his freezer. Before Hugo leaves for the store, 
    he tells Marcos that he is expecting a friend to come over, saying it 
    is his &quot;partner&quot;. Now here is when the film turns crazy. 
    Every time the doorbell rings, it means deadly trouble for Marcos. 
    The first time it rings, two hoods handcuff Marcos and tie his neck 
    to the bathroom shower, while they use him as a punching bag. Marcos 
    then snaps the handcuffs in two and kills the two hoods in very 
    bloody ways, turning his once clean bathroom into a bloodbath. It is 
    obvious that the two hoods mistakened Marcos for Hugo, but why did 
    they want him dead? When Hugo returns, Marcos takes him to the 
    bathroom to show him the two dead men, which he has placed in the 
    bathtub, but Hugo plays innocent and says he has no idea who they 
    are. The next time the doorbell rings, it policeman Fridman (Luis 
    Ziembrowski), who is investigating reports of screams coming from the 
    house, so Marcos has Hugo play for time while he tidies up the 
    bathroom and hides the two bodies (where he places them is a 
    scream!). The next time the doorbell rings, it's Hugo's 
    &quot;partner&quot; Caf&eacute; con Leche (a very funny Luis 
    Aranosky). Marcos sends Hugo back to the store to get some beer and 
    champagne, knowing full well that Caf&eacute; con Leche is a letch. 
    While Hugo is away, Marcos ties Caf&eacute; to a chair and 
    continually smacks him in the back of his head until he tells him the 
    truth (It's a running joke through the rest of the film). It seems he 
    and Hugo have a human liver to sell to the old man, who needs a liver 
    transplant. Hugo placed the liver in Marcos' freezer without him 
    knowing it and Marcos ate it for lunch! When Hugo returns, Marcos has 
    him phone the old man's daughter and tell her that the liver is no 
    longer available. She wants Hugo to return the $500,000 she paid him 
    for the liver, but he tells her he no longer has it. He gave it away 
    to all the poor people in the area (In the beginning of the film, we 
    see a person in a Devil mask throwing huge wads of cash in the air, 
    while poor people scramble to grab it. That Devil was Hugo.). The 
    daughter is extremely mad, so she hires a squad of crooked cops, led 
    by the muscular Teniente Coronel Varela (stunt director Hugo 
    &quot;Kato&quot; Quiril, who looks like Sylvester Stallone on a very 
    bad day!), as they invade Marcos' house and it becomes a very bloody 
    shootout/fistfight. There is much more that happens here, but this is 
    a film best watched cold. It's highly violent and very funny, thanks 
    to the chemistry between Hugo and Marcos, who really do love each 
    other. Director/co-screenwriter Nicanor Loreti has made a film with a 
    lot of heart, soul, humor and bloody violence. It's a winning 
    combination that you are bound to love, as long as you don't mind 
    subtitles. I caught this streaming for free on Tubi.;<A NAME="Masks2011"></A>&nbsp;
     &nbsp; I have had German director Andreas Marschall's <B><A HREF="masks_2011.htm">MASKS</A></B> 
    (2011) in my Amazon Prime queue for over two years, so in this year 
    of Covid-19 infection (yes, even I contracted it!) I decided to watch 
    it. Unlike the masks we wear when we go outside or come near people 
    in this pandemic-plagued Earth, which are considered necessary and 
    life-saving, the masks in this film, both physical and metaphysical, 
    are dangerous and deadly. This modern-day giallo film will remind you 
    of Dario Argento's <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Suspiria1977">SUSPIRIA</A></B> 
    (1977) in both looks and aesthetics, but with very many differences. 
    Instead of a dance school, it's an acting school and instead of a 
    supernatural mystery, this is a superb giallo film, with much to 
    recommend. Stella (an amazing Susen Ermich) will do anything to 
    become a successful actress, but she doesn't know the pain and 
    anguish she will suffer to achieve that goal. After failing one 
    audition after another, she is about to give up the ghost, but 
    theater director Kaspar (Dieter Rita Scholl) hands her a pamphlet to 
    The Matteusz Gdula Acting School, telling Stella that this is the 
    place she needs to attend if she wants to become a great actress, 
    bringing out emotions in her she never knew she had. Kaspar also 
    tells her that she should be prepared to suffer for her craft, since 
    this school's acting techniques are quite unlike any other acting 
    school out there. Stella, along with her boyfriend Florian (Michael 
    Siller), go on the Internet to do some research on the school and 
    learn that Matteusz Gdula was under investigation for causing the 
    deaths of some of his students, so he committed suicide in 1973. 
    Former students, such as Lenka (Stefanie Grabner), praise Gdula's 
    brilliance and say that they will always remember what this great man 
    taught them. Florian drives Stella to the school, where they almost 
    hit student Britt (Franziska Breite) as she comes running out of the 
    school, tears in her eyes and a frightened look on her face. Stella 
    is accepted into the school based on the anger she shows in her 
    audition, which is directed at the other downright mean (and jealous) 
    acting students, who put down Stella, calling her &quot;Barbie&quot; 
    and making fun of her blonde hair. We then see Britt and her roommate 
    Lydia (Katja Lawrenz) being murdered by a mysterious black-gloved <A HREF="masks_2011.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/masks 2011 amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>figure
     holding a thin-bladed sword. The figure stabs Lydia with the sword 
    by thrusting it through her neck and then stabbing her in the back 
    with it. Britt is killed by having her throat cut, but not with the 
    sword (you'll have to watch the film to find out). Now I could go on 
    and on telling you what you are in store for, but that would be a big 
    disservice, because this is a film to be enjoyed for so many reasons, 
    especially the little details this film revels in. (Pay close 
    attention to Britt's photo hanging in the school's hallway). Nedless 
    to say, Stella becomes the newest student to be taught the 
    &quot;Method&quot;, a painful series of private &quot;acting&quot; 
    classes that fellow Method acting student Cecile (Julita Witt) 
    mistakenly reveals to her (they become lesbian lovers), which pisses 
    off teacher Roza Janowska (an excellent Magdalena Ritter). When the 
    police show up at the school to investigate Britt's murder and 
    newspaper reporter Mike (Marcel Trunsch) begins asking questions 
    about the school to Stella, Cecile disappears and Rosa offers to 
    teach Stella the Method (Which includes drinking a concoction of LSD 
    and mescaline in order to bring out Stella innermost forgotten 
    emotions! She then wakes up with round bruises on her body with a 
    deep scapel cut in the middle of the wounds, just like the wounds 
    Cecile and Britt had.&nbsp; Let's just say you will never guess why 
    those round wounds are on Method actors' bodies!). That's as far as I 
    am going to get into the plot, as we must guess who is killing all 
    the people who dare reveal what the Method entails or get too close 
    to the truth (the trusty sword is used in various bloody ways [and 
    well done physical effects] including eardrum punctures, stabbing 
    clear through a person's cheeks [we see the thin blade go through one 
    cheek, enter the mouth and exit out the other cheek!] and stabbing a 
    person through the back of the head until the long blade exits out 
    their mouth. There's also a very painful death by scissors that 
    really hits you in the gut [or, rather, in the throat].). The finale 
    of this film is one of the most heart-breaking, yet fantastically 
    revealed denouements I have seen in a film in quite some time. It 
    will definitely take you aback. This film isn't for everyone (It's in 
    German with English subtitles. I speak and understand German very 
    well and whomever did the English subtitles did a superb job.), as it 
    is very bloody and full of nudity, yet if you are a fan of giallo 
    films, this one should satisfy your jones for a few weeks. The 
    cinematography is fantastic, almost an exact copy of what Argento 
    delivered in the '70s, and the music soundtrack, by Sebastian 
    Levermann and Nils Weise, is about as close to sounding like Goblin 
    as you will ever hear. Giallo films aren't dead, you just have to 
    look for them! I love this film and so should every giallo fan out there!;<A NAME="Inbred2011"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="inbred_2011.htm">INBRED</A></B> (2011) may be the 
    goriest film of the New Millennium, but if you watch it on the 
    YouTube channel &quot;Watch Movies Now!&quot; it has been edited to 
    pieces, declawing the film&nbsp; of nearly every gory scene. This 
    channel is known for cutting explicit sex, nudity and violence in the 
    movies they stream, just to please YouTube's new policy of not 
    allowing nudity, sex or gory violence to be shown on their platform. 
    Luckily, I found an uncut version of this film. Where, you may ask? 
    Why, on YouTube, proving that their new policy is a bunch of crap! 
    It's only meant to encourage channels to edit the films themselves 
    out of fear (Let's not talk about YouTube's new commercial policy. It 
    made me give up YouTube for good!). The film is about four troubled 
    teens, who, along with two chaperones, travel to a remote village in 
    England to strip old railway cars of anything valuable (It's their 
    punishment for minor crimes they committed). Unfortunately, this 
    little village is populated by inbred mutants (the movie uses 
    real-life people who suffer from deformities, which made me very 
    uncomfortable). The head of this village is Jim (Seamus O'Neill), who 
    has three inbred sons (one of whom is obsessed with carrots!) and may 
    be solely responsible for all the other inbreds in town (it is never 
    made clear). This small village doesn't take too kindly to strangers, 
    so when the teens and their chaperones enter Jim's pub, the 
    &quot;Dirty Dog&quot;, they are seen as meals for these cannibalistic 
    inbreeders. If you watched this film on Watch Movies Now!, you missed 
    these epic bits of gore: A man taking an axe to his mouth, a woman 
    getting her leg cut off with said axe; one of the chaperones getting 
    his head cut off with a meat cleaver by Jim (it's the most shocking 
    scene in the film); Jim dressing in blackface (which would be deemed 
    racist today) and putting on a stage show for an audience of inbreds 
    where one of the teens gets the top of his head smashed-in when a 
    horse steps on him; the other chaperone getting her hand blown-off 
    with a shotgun; an inbred man getting the top of his head blown-off 
    with a shotgun; another inbred man getting his balls blown-off with 
    the same shotgun; and the film's main and most explicit kill: another 
    teen getting force-fed shit with a pressure hose until his eyes pop 
    out of his skull and his stomach expands and explodes, spraying shit 
    all over the inbred audience (who are wearing goggles so they don't 
    get shit in their eyes!). There's more to be seen, but I'll leave 
    that for you to discover. The special makeup effects are great and 
    done with a sense of panache. You'll want to rewind and watch them 
    again to make sure you saw it right. Director Alex Chandon (<B><A HREF="films_on_the_fringe.htm#CradleOfFear">CRADLE
     OF FEAR</A></B> - 2001) has turned in a film so gross, you will 
    either love it or hate it. I happened to love it, especially for the 
    great gore effects. It's played broadly, like some black comedy, but 
    it is a very fatalistic film, where our &quot;heroes&quot; never 
    catch a break. You have to admire that. I did and I usually hate 
    films where the good guys lose, but this one was done in a way that 
    you can't help but like it.;&nbsp; <B><A HREF="take_shelter_2011.htm">TAKE

    is he? Construction worker Curtis (the terrific Michael Shannon; <B><A HREF="boardwalk_empire_tv_series.htm">BOARDWALK
     EMPIRE</A></B> [2010 - 2014]) begins to have apocalyptic visions 
    (like thousands of birds flying in unison in the sky) which his best 
    friend and co-worker Dewart (Shea Whigham; also on <B><A HREF="boardwalk_empire_tv_series.htm">BOARDWALK
     EMPIRE</A></B>) doesn't see at all. The visions become so bad that 
    his loving wife, Samantha (Jessica Chastain, who is becoming a force 
    to recon with), suggests he goes to a doctor (They have a daughter 
    who is deaf). He does, but the doctor can find nothing wrong with 
    him, so he recommends seeing a psychiatrist. Curtis believes so much 
    in his visions that he takes a high-risk loan from the bank (even his 
    bank loan officer tries to dissuade him from signing it) to build and 
    underground shelter in his backyard. What happens next is best for 
    the viewer to discover, but let me say this: This film has one of the 
    best closing shots of the new Millennium and you'll forever remember 
    it, just like the ending of <B><A HREF="electra_glide_in_blue_1973.htm">ELECTRA
     GLIDE IN BLUE</A></B> (1973). It's that good. This Cannes 
    award-winner played a limited one week theatrical release in the U.S. 
    before going DTV; Speaking of Michael Shannon, did anyone else notice 
    that in the film <B><A HREF="premium_rush_2012.htm">PREMIUM RUSH</A></B> (2012)<A NAME="Good2012"></A>,
     where Shannon plays crooked cop Bobby Monday, that when he was on

    Dean Of Students.&quot;? If you don't know who the late Forrest J. 
    Ackerman was, you have no reason to be on this site. The film itself 
    is a nice little actioner about a bike messenger (Joseph 
    Gordon-Levitt) being pursued around New York City by Monday in order 
    to get his hands on said ticket to pay off his gambling debts. There 
    are some great stunts on view and Shannon is great to watch, even if 
    the story is a little thin (his death scene, though, is one for the 
    books); <B><A HREF="eden_2012.htm">EDEN</A></B> (2012) is a mostly

    O'Leary) and his boss Bob Gault (Beau Bridges), who teaches the U.S. 
    Border Patrol how to spot human coyotes and illegal aliens! What 
    Vaughn and Bob don't realize is that Eden is actually 19 years-old 
    and is not underaged and uses her brains to turn the drug-taking 
    Vaughn against Bob (even after Eden bites a guy's dick off on her 
    first day as a prostitute!). She works her way up the ladder in the 
    business, taking over the phone calls from johns requesting children 
    for sex and even handling the books, but what she is really doing is 
    trying to save herself and new friend Abbie (Tracey Fairaway), an 
    underaged girl who has just had a baby that was illegally adopted. 
    How Eden does it is cold and calculated and even if the film ends 
    rather abruptly, it is a satisfying mix of truth and fiction (these 
    rings do exist) where all the bad guys get their comeuppance by a 
    girl with a good head on her shoulders. Director/co-writer Megan 
    Griffiths turns in a good film on a shoestring budget and I recommend 
    it to one and all; <B><A HREF="nurse_3d_2012.htm">NURSE 3D</A></B> 
    (2012) was not released in the U.S. until early 2014, but that should 
    not deter you from watching one of the most graphic films made in the 
    past 10 years (Available in R-Rated and Unrated editions. Guess which 
    one you should go for?). The beautiful Paz de la Huerta (<B><A HREF="boardwalk_empire_tv_series.htm">BOARDWALK
     EMPIRE</A></B>) is Abby Russell, a dedicated nurse by day and a 
    killer of cheating men by night (who also happens to be a closeted 
    lesbian). Her methods of killing leave little room for survival, as 
    we first see her cut the femoral artery on the leg of a cheating 
    married man she meets at at bar and watches him bleed to death. This 
    is the least bloody murder in the the film, because, as it 
    progresses, it becomes more and more bloody, culminating in one of 
    the craziest murder sprees in a hospital Intensive Ward ever recorded 
    on film. In between the first murder and the spree killing (she does 
    it just for the hell of it because she is being chased!), we are 
    treated to Abby befriending new nurse Danni (Katrina Bowden) and 
    falling in love with her. In one scene Abby slips Danni a roofie at a 
    bar and takes her home, where she rapes her (we hear Abby describe it 
    in one of her many narrations in the film). Abby thinks if she gets 
    rid of Danni's stepfather, psychiatrist Larry Cook (Martin Donovan), 
    she will have Danni all for herself, so she goes to Larry under the 
    pretense of being a patient (telling him she is addicted to men) and 
    then comes on to him later on and kills him in his car (his death is 
    a doozy). This only makes Danni suspicious and when cheating head 
    surgeon Dr. Morris (Judd Nelson) is tied to an operating table by 
    Abby while she cuts off his arm with a bone saw (nothing is left to 
    the imagination), Danni goes to Detective John Rogan (Boris Kodjoe) 
    with her suspicions and everything begins to unwind for Abby. She 
    goes stark raving bonkers and stabs a guy through the neck with a 
    pair of surgical shears from the back to the front and makes sure to 
    open them (most of the murders were filmed to take advantage of the 
    3-D effects although I watched it flat), stabs another guy in the 
    side of the neck with scissors and then does unimaginal things in the 
    Intensive Ward while she is being chased by the authorities, which 
    leads to the beginnings of a sequel ready to be made (although none 
    is planned at the time of this writing). This is nothing spectacular; 
    just an old-fashioned gorefest with plenty of nudity. We all need to 
    watch a mindless film like this every once in a while.

    (2012) is a funny horror/comedy from director/writer J.T. Petty (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Burrowers2008">THE
     BURROWERS</A></B> - 2008) about the members of The Augustine 
    Interfaith Order of Hellbound Saints (Clancy Brown, Clifton Collins 
    Jr., Robyn Rikoon, Dan Fogler, Andre Royo and Macon Blair), who must 
    battle some real demons as well as an assortment of inner demons. 
    They are a bunch of foul-mouthed, hard-drinking and pot-smoking 
    members of a fringe section of the Church, who are called upon to 
    exorcise demons from the bodies of everyday people. Things get out of 
    hand when Elizabeth (Rikoon) is possessed by a demon powerful enough 
    to open the Gateway to Hell (which looks like a flaming vagina and 
    there's a funny scene that take place when the possessed Elizabeth 
    sticks her hand in it), but first she has to possess a bunch of 
    people by sending possessed flies down their mouth so they can do 
    battle with the Interfaith Order. Both Clancy Brown (who is suffering 
    the effects from being semi-possessed too many times at exorcisms) 
    and Clifton Collins Jr. (his biggest role in years) are absolute 
    hoots as they battle not just demons, but an executive who kicks them 
    out of the order, supposedly at the bequest of the Church. If you 
    like your humor raunchy and your violence bloody (members of the 
    Order always seem to get a finger or toe bitten off!), then by all 
    means enjoy the hell out of this film. Larry Fessenden has a role as 
    the detective in charge of the cases the exorcism team performs. Also 
    starring Stephen Gevedon, Edoardo Ballerini (as an ineffectual 
    exorcist who has both his eyes bitten out) and Samanta Buck as 
    Collins' frustrated wife who always appears or calls at the most 
    inappropriate times (Collins had a brief affair with Elizabeth and 
    the film ends on a bitterly funny note). &quot;Did any of you find my 
    nose around here?&quot; Recommended; A lot of people rag on Eli Roth 
    because he is an uber horror fan who gets to do the kind of films he 
    wants. Take for instance <B><A HREF="aftershock_2012.htm">AFTERSHOCK</A></B> 
    (2012), a film Roth doesn't direct (Nicol&aacute;s L&oacute;pez 
    handles that chore), but Roth stars, co-wrote the screenplay and 
    co-produced. And it was filmed in Valparaiso, Chile!. Not your normal 
    location for a film of this type. Roth stars as a divorced lawyer dad 
    who is spending some vacation time with his two male friends from 
    Chile (don't worry, they are bi-lingual, although there are some 
    subtitles in the film). They spend the first half of the film hitting 
    on girls, trying to get Roth laid, at clubs, raves (where everyone 
    seems to be tripping out on drugs) and even tour a wine making 
    company (the female tour guide is also a bartender at an exclusive 
    club). They then make a trip to a secluded party at that exclusive 
    club (which is only available by tram car that is operated by a very 
    nasty man) near a cemetery when the worst possible thing happens: an 
    earthquake. Then the blood literally hits the fan, as appendages are 
    torn off, people are graphically crushed under concrete and other 
    victims are crushed under the feet of other people (Not to mention 
    the tram car wire snapping and killing one of the major cast 
    members). To make matters worse, the earthquake releases everyone at 
    a nearby prison and no woman is safe, including the three troubled 
    women they have hooked up with. To tell you any more (OK, just one 
    thing: Roth is killed in one of the worst horrible deaths in recent 
    filmic history) would be to ruin a fast-paced horror/thriller filled 
    with double-crosses, gunfire, axe attacks, frequent aftershocks and 
    even rape. The only problem I have is that the ending was telegraphed 
    halfway through the film. Otherwise, this is a good way to spend 88 
    minutes because it surprises by not following genre film conventions. 
    Look for singer Selena Gomez in a cameo as a spoiled V.I.P. at one of 
    the nightclubs who blows-off Roth. For those Eli Roth haters, all I 
    can say is that you are probably jealous because he made his dreams 
    come true and you would probably murder someone if it made you like

    believe a word she says. The rest of the film details Jill's efforts 
    to find her sister, using clues she picks up on her search, while the 
    police, when finding out she has a gun, try to stop her. The film is 
    never boring and the finale is satisfying. What more could you ask

    filmed in Louisiana and Bulgaria) and makes for the Mexican town of

    get a drink of water in this town (a running joke), as he is hunted 
    down by a crooked cop (Christian Slater), makes friends with a 
    beautiful female bar owner (Yvette Yates), fights with a gang

    female thief (Sof&iacute;a Sisniega) who keeps stealing his bag of

    nothing. Filled with bloody gunfights, martial arts combat and 
    welcome doses of humor, this film will satisfy your action needs for 
    a night; <B><A HREF="savages_2012.htm">SAVAGES</A></B> (2012) is 
    director Oliver Stone's excellent and gory (it starts with a series 
    of absolutely bloody chainsaw decapitations) drug thriller about two 
    friends, marijuana growers Chon (Taylor Kitsch, who I am rapidly 
    becoming a fan of) and and Ben (Aaron Johnson), whose shared 
    girlfriend O (Blake Lively) is kidnapped by Mexico's biggest female 
    drug cartel leader, Elena (Salma Hayek, in an award-winning 
    performance). Elena holds O hostage to get Chon and Ben to give her a 
    share in their highly profitable business (And uses the Internet to 
    show Chon &amp; Ben streaming footage of O being sexually and 
    physically abused by her henchmen. As a matter of fact, the Internet 
    plays an important part in this film, almost a character unto 
    itself.), but when the guys have had enough, they kidnap Elena's 
    daughter, Magda (Sandra Echeverr&iacute;a), and offer a trade. There 
    is so much more going on in this star-studded thriller, including 
    Benicio Del Toro as Elena's traitorous second-in-command, John 
    Travolta (sans hairpiece, which makes him look years older) as a 
    crooked cop and plenty of other cameos, including Shea Whigham, Emile 
    Hirsch and Joel David Moore. This did play theaters, but barely made 
    its production costs back in the U.S. (in an R-Rated version), so 
    rent the 10-minute longer Unrated Version on DVD or Blu-Ray (it 
    doesn't add any violence, but adds more background to some of the 
    characters, so you can understand their motivations better) and be 
    prepared to be blown away. It's Stone's best, most violent film in 
    years; <B><A HREF="maximum_conviction_2012.htm">MAXIMUM CONVICTION</A></B> 
    (2012) is the first film to team-up Steven Seagal and Steve Austin 
    and since it was directed by Keoni Waxman, who brought out the best 
    in Seagal in <B><A HREF="action.htm#Keeper2009">THE KEEPER</A></B> 
    (2009) and Austin in <B><A HREF="hunt_to_kill_2010.htm">HUNT TO KILL</A></B> 
    (2010), you know you're going to be in for a wild ride. The two 
    Steves are black ops partners who must protect two female witnesses 
    in a prison that is being decommissioned. When head bad guy Michael 
    Par&eacute; and his band of mercenaries invade the prison looking for 
    the two girls (there is more to both of the women than meets the 
    eye), the two Steves must fight to keep the girls and themselves 
    alive. Filmed with grand fights and gunfire, as well as some funny 
    banter between Seagal and Austin, this is one of the best DTV action 
    films of both Seagal and Austin's careers. If it was directed by 
    anyone other than Waxman (who also directed Dolph Lundgren in <B><A HREF="sweepers_1998.htm">SWEEPERS</A></B> 
    [1998] using the pseudonym &quot;Darby Black&quot;), it would 
    probably stink on ice, but he is an action director to keep an eye 
    on.; Speaking of Steve Austin, in <B><A HREF="package_2012.htm">THE PACKAGE</A></B> 
    (2012) he teams up with Dolph Lundgren for the first time in a story 
    as old as time itself, but for some reason it works. Austin is Tommy 
    Wick, a debt collector for mobster Big Doug (Eric Keenleyside) and 
    Doug hands Tommy a &quot;package&quot; (a leather-bound note book) to 
    deliver to &quot;The German&quot; (Lundgren), a health food-eating 
    gangster who is suffering from a terminal disease, yet is still a 
    badass. Big Doug will then pay Tommy's brother's debt and get him out 
    of jail, Soon, every piece of street scum is after the package, 
    especially Devon (the late Darren Shahlavi) and his duo of torturers 
    and killers. To make a long story short, the leather notebook is not 
    the package at all, Tommy is. He has the same rare blood type as The 
    German and it can save his life. Tommy bites off the ear of the 
    doctor (William B. Davis; <B><A HREF="x_files_tv_1993_2002.htm">THE X-FILES</A></B> 
    [2003-1992]) as he is about to draw blood, breaks his wrist strap and 
    throws a hypodermic needle into the doctor's neck. Tommy and The 
    German get into a fight, where Tommy riddles The German with bullets. 
    Tommy gets his brother out of jail (Big Doug keeps his promise!) and 
    finds a satchel full of money in a trunk of a car, so he can finally 
    take his wife on that trip she always wanted to take. Austin and 
    Lundgren spend mininimal time on screen, but director Jesse V. 
    Johnson (<B><A HREF="savage_dog_2017.htm">SAVAGE DOG</A></B> - 2017) 
    crams as much gunfire and hand-to-hand combat (where Austin doesn't 
    always come up the winner) as human possible into one film. And 
    another thing thing you don't usually see Austin do in films: He 
    actually smiles! Worth a quick look if just as brain candy.;&nbsp; <B><A HREF="brake_2012.htm">BRAKE</A></B>

    office (it only grossed about half of its production costs in U.S. 
    theaters), but it is a perfectly good popcorn movie for sitting at 
    home on a Saturday night. A clean-shaven teenage Lincoln (Benjamin 
    Walker) is recruited by good vampire Henry Sturges <A HREF="abraham_lincoln_vampire_hunter_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/abraham lincoln vampire hunter dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(Dominic
     Cooper) to fight vampires, who are using the southern states to 
    begin to form the entire United States as their own country (slavery 
    plays an important part in this). Since Sturges is harboring a secret 
    of his own (in part of the new vampire mythology [you can't have a 
    new vampire film without at least one], vampires can't kill other 
    vampires), Lincoln (with his stovepipe hat) becomes a vampire killing 
    machine with his tricked-out silver axe, with the help of ex-slave 
    childhood friend Will Johnson (Anthony Mackie) and store owner Joshua 
    Speed (Jimmi Simpson). The Civil War eventually comes into play 
    (President Lincoln now has his famous beard), with vampire Adam 
    (Rufus Sewell) as the head bad guy, which leads to some inventive 
    special effects involving a train supposedly carrying silver to 
    Gettysburg. This film is bloody as hell (lots of beheadings) and 
    contains plenty of camera tricks, trademarks of director Timur 
    Bekmambetov (<B><A HREF="wanted_2008.htm">WANTED</A></B> - 2008), who 
    mixes fact with mostly fiction to very good effect (even Mary Todd 
    Lincoln [Mary Elizabeth Winstead] gets her revenge on female vampire 
    Vadoma [Erin Wasson], who killed her son). A lot of speculation has 
    people thinking that Henry Sturges recruits Barack Obama at the end 
    of the film, but it is actually screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith 
    (based on his own novel) who plays Sturges' newest recruit (A lot of 
    people read way too much into the conclusion). Tim Burton was one of 
    the Producers, along with Jim Lemley and Bekmambetov. It is miles

    play important secondary roles (although they never appear together 
    in the same scene together), the film belongs to Scott Adkins (<B><A HREF="el_gringo_2012.htm">EL
     GRINGO</A></B> - 2012) as a newly-minted Universal Soldier (or as 
    one scientist puts it: &quot;My God, he's just a baby. He's only 
    three weeks old!&quot;) who tries to find the truth behind the 
    Universal Soldier program (which the government have made him believe 
    he has witnessed the brutal murders of his wife and young daughter at 
    the hands of Van Damme and his cronies), which now lays straightly in 
    the hands of both Lundgren and Van Damme, who are the bad guys in 
    this (or at least they both stole the program away from the 
    government for their own purposes). Filled with great fightings 
    scenes and brutal deaths (my favorites has to do with an aluminum 
    baseball bat in a sporting goods store), director John Hyams, the son 
    of director Peter Hyams (<B><A HREF="timecop_1994.htm">TIMECOP</A></B> 
    - 1994, also with Van Damme), has made an action film the 
    old-fashioned way. No quick editing or shakey camera tricks (there 
    are a couple of flashing scenes which could trigger seizures in 
    epileptics). Just good old-fashioned blood and guts. Go for the 
    Unrated Version or you'll miss out on some primo bloodletting. 
    Bravo!; <B><A HREF="compliance_2012.htm">COMPLIANCE</A></B> (2012) is 
    director/writer Craig Zobel's horrifying true-based film about how 
    people can be fooled to do anything over the phone. A man (Pat Healy) 
    pretending to be a cop named &quot;Officer Daniels&quot; calls up 
    Sandra (Ann Dowd), the manager of fast food Chickwich chain, and 
    tells her that one of her female employees, Becky (Dreama Walker), 
    has stolen money out of a woman's pocketbook. He talks Sandra into 
    taking Becky to the back room and gleans information from Becky and 
    Sandra to make it seem that Becky is guilty of more than theft of 
    money. &quot;Officer Daniels&quot; talks Sandra and other people 
    (including Sandra's drunk fiance Van [Bill Camp]) to strip-search 
    Becky, which eventually leads to sodomy and rape. Terrifying because 
    it has actually happened in real-life more than 70 times, the film 
    shows how easily people can be talked into doing the most horrifying 
    of things. I'm still shaking because it could actually happen again, 
    for a lot of people are like lemmings and will do anything they are 
    told without using any basic deductive reasoning whatsoever. The fact 
    that the fake cop is caught and turns out to be a nobody telemarketer 
    just shows how easily people can be fooled and yet, these people who 
    were fooled refuse to take responsibility for their heinous actions 
    (they believe they are victims, too!) simply because the person on 
    the other end of the phone said he was a cop; <B><A HREF="sushi_girl_2012.htm">SUSHI
     GIRL</A></B> (2012) is a decent little thriller, even if it does 
    contain a little too much &quot;torture porn&quot; for my tastes. 
    Five thieves, led by Duke (Tony Todd, in one of his biggest roles in 
    quite a while) rob a jewelry store and get into an auto accident one 
    their way back to their hideout. Something bad happens (told in quick 
    flashback bursts) and newcomer to the gang, Fish (Noah Hathaway), 
    gets caught by the police and serves six years in jail, never ratting 
    on his fellow thieves. On his way out of prison, his former partners 
    in crime hold a celebratory dinner for him, complete with a naked 
    &quot;sushi girl&quot; (Cortney Palm) on the table, who is covered in 
    raw fish. Turns out this was all a trap, as the diamonds from the 
    heist were never found and they tie Fish to a chair and slowly 
    torture him every three minutes using an egg timer Duke has brought 
    with him (along with a story why he carries it). Before long, Fish is 
    being tortured by having his knees hammered with spikes, teeth pulled 
    without any anaesthesia (by an obese gay Mark Hamill) and generally 
    having the shit beat out of him by the gang, who want to know where 
    the diamonds are. The flashbacks are the clues, and 
    director/co-writer Kern Saxton waits a little too long to show us 
    what really happened, but the finale is very well done, if not 
    telegraphed from one of the late flashbacks. You could do a lot worse 
    than this film and I have many times. Look for cameos by Sonny Chiba, 
    Jeff Fahey, Michael Biehn and Danny Trejo; <B><A HREF="cold_light_of_day_2012.htm">THE

     GONE DEAD</A></B> (2012) is a pretty funny and extremely gory tale 
    about a group of young women (including a very religious one) who go 
    down to Florida on Spring Break for a week of fun. What they find is 
    anything but. A hooded, red-robed killer, wearing a mask and swinging 
    an ancient warhammer, begins dispatching the girls and anyone else 
    who gets in their way (including that toothless mental midget 
    comedian known as Beetle Juice [who passed away in 2014], who is 
    decapitated). Filled with naked girls, funny lines (watch Linnea 
    Quigley try to do an Australian accent!), shots of extreme gore (stay 
    away from the R-Rated version and go for the Unrated one) and a good 
    performance by wrestler Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler (who should 
    keep on acting because his delivery is priceless). While it is not 
    hard to figure out who is the killer(s), this is still a bloody good 
    time with a cast of extremely pretty girls who are not afraid to doff 
    their tops and more. The kind of exploitative horror film that

    explainable story is about two guys who get injected with a black 
    substance called &quot;soy sauce&quot; and begin to have 
    interdimensional experiences that can best be described as a 
    world-reknown philosopher tripping out on LSD. Lots of weird visuals 
    (my favorite being an other-dimentional being's moustache becoming a 
    bat-like creature) and a great sense of black humor abound. If your 
    like to watch something different, this is the film for you. Keep 
    your eyes peeled for a cameo by Coscarelli regular Angus Scrimm as a 
    priest; <B><A HREF="hell_baby_2013.htm">HELL BABY</A></B> (2012) is a 
    very funny possessed baby film if you are in the right frame of mind. 
    Fans of <B><A HREF="reno_911_2003-2009.htm">RENO 911!</A></B> will 
    recognize a lot of the actors in this slapstick horror film with some 
    extremely gory (and sexy) moments. Rob Coddry and a very pregnant 
    Leslie Bibb play a married couple who move into a house in New 
    Orleans that has a history of murder behind it. They have a black guy 
    named F'resnel (a funny Keegan-Michael Key) who lives in their 
    crawlspace and is always sneaking up behind them and making them 
    scream. He tells them the history of the house and it is not good. 
    The Vatican sends two priests (Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon, 
    who are simply hilarious and both wrote &amp; directed the film, to 
    boot) to New Orleans because Bibb is about to give birth to twins and 
    one of them is the Devil's son. Weird things begin to happen at the 
    house (including a lamp that keeps shocking Coddry, which will come 
    in handy later) and the couple believe they have killed their 90 
    year-old neighbor Mrs. Nussbaum (Alex Berg in drag) when Coddry hits 
    her over the head with a metal vase when he discovers her giving him 
    a blowjob at night. They bury her in the backyard, which brings two 
    cops (Paul Scheer and Rob Huebel, who are also very funny) to their 
    door, only to discover Mrs. Nussbaum wasn't dead and wanted to thank 
    them for letting her nap (it's an uncomfortable and gut-busting 
    scene). Bibb's sister (Riki Lindhome, who spends her first scenes 
    completely nude and she's a looker!) and the whole gang are there for 
    the delivery of the Devil's son. I won't say much more, except 
    there's a funny scene of &quot;keep away&quot;, where half the cast 
    end up dead and two funny scenes that take place at the Po'Boy 
    Restaurant. This film played both simultaneously in theaters and on 
    VOD in 2013 before debuting on the Cinemax Networks a few months 
    later in 2014. You'll have a lot of fun with this one because it 
    doesn't hold back on the gore, nudity and bad taste jokes. That's all 
    I need.; I was never a big fan of director William Lustig's <B><A HREF="maniac_1980.htm">MANIAC</A></B> 
    (1980), because the pacing was too slow and it was hard to believe 
    that anyone with the looks of Anna D'Antoni (Caroline Munro) would 
    have anything romantic to do with an ugly mug like Frank Zito (the 
    late Joe Spinell, an actor I loved). Really, all the film had going 
    for it was the sweaty performance of Spinell and some state of the 
    art special effects by Tom Savini, who showed us all what it would be 
    like to see a head blown off with a shotgun through a car's 
    windshield (a defining moment in 1980's horror movies). Now let's 
    talk about director Franck Khalfoun's remake of <B><A HREF="maniac_2012.htm">MANIAC</A></B> 
    (2012). Now this is a film that I love and not just because it is 
    gory as hell (and Unrated when shown in theaters, where it didn't 
    last very long), but because of the way it was filmed. In this remake 
    Elijah Wood (<B><A HREF="cooties_2014.htm">COOTIES</A></B> - 2014) is 
    Frank and the whole film is shown through his eyes (The only time we 
    see his face is when he looks at mirrors, see his reflections in 
    windows or shiny surfaces. The next film to use this technique would 
    be <B><A HREF="hardcore_henry_2015.htm">HARDCORE HENRY</A></B> - 
    2015; and an earlier film to use it was <B><A HREF="lady_in_the_lake_1947.htm">LADY
     IN THE LAKE</A></B> - 1947.) and hear his voice and thoughts. Frank 
    is an unhinged serial killer of women, but something happens to the 
    audience: We begin to have an emotional attachment to him because all 
    he wants is to be loved. When the movie starts, Frank is following 
    Judy (Liane Balaban), down a dark street, but he lets her go, saying 
    &quot;Goodnight Judy, I know where you live. See you later.&quot; and 
    then we see Frank's eyes in the rear-view mirror of his car. Frank 
    then drives to the apartment where Judy's female friend lives, cuts 
    all the electricity to the apartment building and lays in wait for 
    her. She turns around and sees him and Frank says, &quot;Please don't 
    scream. You're so beautiful.&quot; Before she is able to scream, 
    Frank stabs her in the neck with a rather large knife and then scalps 
    her, nothing left to the imagination (He holds her severed scalp 
    while her body falls to the floor and then the title <A HREF="maniac_2012b.htm"><B>MANIAC</B></A> 
    comes on screen). We then see Frank trolling on Internet dating sites 
    using the handle &quot;Timid Man&quot; and makes a connection with 
    Lucie (Megan Duffy), a pretty woman with long red hair.&nbsp; They 
    meet at a restaurant and Frank is so paranoid, he thinks everyone is 
    looking at him, so he rushes to to the bathroom to splash water on 
    his face. He <A HREF="maniac_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/maniac 2012 poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="154" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ends
     up driving Lucie to her apartment, where he is invited for a drink. 
    Uh, oh. Lucie gets more comfortable by stripping to her bra and 
    panties, where Frank takes off her bra and feels her breasts (he 
    notices photos of herself all over one wall, which leads him to 
    believe she is an exhibitionist, which she certainly is.). Lucie 
    says, &quot;Do you wanna fuck me?&quot; and Frank answers &quot;I 
    can't!&quot; and falls onto the bed, where he sees himself in a 
    full-view mirror attached to the ceiling. Lucie jumps on top of him, 
    unbuttons his pants and begins to perform oral sex on him, while 
    Frank watches the whole thing on the ceiling mirror. He ends up 
    choking Lucie to death with his two hands, We then find out that 
    Frank has a split personalty and the bad one scalps Lucie with a 
    straight razor (a hard sequence to watch because it is so realistic 
    looking), while his good personality throws up in Lucie's toilet 
    after the deed is done. As in the first film, Frank uses the scalps 
    to put on manniquins (he uses a staple gun to attach the scalps to 
    their heads), while he talks to his &quot;girlfriend&quot; in his bed 
    (we don't see her because she is covered from head to toe with a 
    blanket and all we see is blood on the pillow). We then learn why 
    Frank is so fascinated with hair. Flashbacks reveal that his mother 
    (America Olivo) use to make him watch her brush her hair and there 
    may have been some incest involved (which would explain the split 
    personality). She passed away a year ago, about the same time Frank 
    became a serial killer. Frank then meets photographer Anna (Nora 
    Arnezeder), who only shoots mannequins and she is quite good at it. 
    Frank invites her into his shop, where he restores mannequins to 
    their original beauty (&quot;Sometimes I think they have more 
    personality than people.&quot; is Frank's remark to Anna) and she 
    gives him her card just in case Frank will let her shoot them for an 
    art galley exhibition. Could Anna actually be Frank's dream girl? Can 
    he stop his bad personality from killing her? And how many more women 
    will die before the film ends? I'll never tell, because director

     CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI</A></B> [1920] that really tells us who 
    Frank really is.). We really feel bad for Frank's good side because 
    all he wants is a nice woman to spend the rest of his life with, but 
    his bad personality always gets in the way (What he does to Anna's 
    agent is almost more that one human being can bear to see!). This is 
    a remake done right and, in my mind, beats the original by a country 
    mile. Recommended to all with strong stomachs.;<A NAME="NiteLivDedRe-An2012"></A> <B><A HREF="night_of_the_living_dead_3d_re-animation_2012.htm">NIGHT
     OF THE LIVING DEAD (3D): RE-ANIMATION</A></B> (2012) is a film I 
    should hate with a passion, but I can't, for two main reasons. They 
    would be the acting talents of Andrew Divoff (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Rage2007">THE
     RAGE</A></B> - 2007) and Jeffrey Combs (<B><A HREF="would_you_rather_2012.htm">WOULD
     YOU RATHER</A></B> - 2012), who play estranged brothers Gerald and 
    Harold Tovar. When their father died, Gerald took over the family 
    mortuary business, while Harold went out into the world to create his 
    own money-making ventures, failing spectacularly (he never bothered 
    to attend his father's funeral). Gerald, on the other hand, is in 
    serious trouble. His father had a &quot;side business&quot; where the 
    government would send him things that they didn't want made public, 
    pay him money and he would burn whatever was sent him in the 
    crematorium. Gerald, however is &quot;pyrophobic&quot; (an extreme 
    fear of fire) and he hasn't creamated any bodies, who were supposed 
    to be cremated and not buried, ever since his father died. He let the 
    bodies pile up in the crematorium, padlocking the door and telling 
    his employees that the oven is broken and the crematorium<A HREF="night_of_the_living_dead_3d_re-animation_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/night of the living dead 3d re-animation poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    room is off-limits. When the government send over a body bag full of 
    a chemicals Gerald calls &quot;Life's Blood&quot;, it causes all the 
    bodies in the crematorium to come to life, creating a new breed of 
    zombies. After not seeing him for ten years, Harold shows up at the 
    mortuary and demands a large sum of money from Gerald, telling him if 
    he doesn't fork it over, he will contest their father's will, since 
    Gerald inherited the business, the house and all the land they are 
    built on and Harold got nothing. Complicating matters is new employee 
    Cristie Forrest (Sarah Lieving; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#SixSixSixTheChild06">666:
     THE CHILD</A></B> - 2006), who is hired to replace fuck-up employee 
    Dyeanne (Robin Sydney; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#GingerdeadMan">THE
     GINGERDEAD MAN</A></B> - 2005), who applies makeup to corpses, 
    making them look like clowns, infuriating the families of the 
    deceased. Dyeanne is actually a necrophile, who has sex with the 
    corpses she works on! (There's a scene where Cristie, Dyeanne and 
    employee Russell [Adam Chambers] trip out on ecstacy that's a real 
    funny headtrip). That's basically the plot in a nutshell, but it's 
    not the story that's interesting, it's the interaction between Gerald 
    and Howard that makes this film so special. Andrew Divoff steals the 
    film with his acting. I have never seen him as good as he is here (He 
    is also a Co-Producer). When he tells Howard about the zombies, all 
    Howard wants to know is, &quot;Are they shamblers or sprinters?&quot; 
    When Gerald says, &quot;They move slow, Harold. They're dead&quot;, 
    Howard says, &quot;Oh, Romero zombies.&quot; He then goes on to say 
    that there were reports of zombies in Pennsylvania in 1968 and 1978; 
    another report of zombies in Ohio in 1985 and then another report 
    back in Pennsylvania in 1990, saying it was almost exactly like the 
    1968 zombie attack, only gorier. I had to laugh out loud at that. 
    There's also Denice Duff as &quot;Sister Sara', a Sarah Palin copy 
    that will make you do a double-take, as her performance is nearly 
    pitch perfect (There's also a &quot;Teabagger&quot; joke which will 
    make you laugh). The film is also gory as hell, as zombies get 
    shotgunned in the head, have their heads cut off or split in two with 
    a shovel (Gerald's favorite weapon), people are bitten and their skin 
    stretches like cheese on a pizza, and there's a death by hydrochloric 
    acid that will get your attention. While I usually despise films that 
    try to copy Romero's classic film, this one is different enough to 
    get me to like it a lot, more than I thought I would, if only because 
    of Divoff and Combs' acting. They are amazing, funny and also 
    touching, something horror films in this day and age are sorely 
    missing. Directed and written by Jeff Broadstreet (director of the 
    really bad <B><A HREF="night_of_the_living_dead_3d_2006.htm">NIGHT OF

     WRONG HOUSE</A></B> - 2012) is an enthralling thriller with a creepy 
    supernatural angle that is more about how people hide their sins and 
    try to carry on as if they did nothing wrong than about anything 
    supernatural, but it works and will have you spellbound till the very 
    end. We see Charlie Hays (Mark Singer; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Watchers2">WATCHERS
     II</A></B> - 1990) tells his new wife Susan (Hayley DuMond; <B><A HREF="raptor_island_2004.htm">RAPTOR
     ISLAND</A></B> - 2004) to get ready to look at a house he found. She 
    asks Charlie is &quot;she&quot; is coming, too, and he says yes, they 
    need to get along better. That &quot;she&quot; is Charlie's teenage 
    daughter Emmy (Janey Gioiosa), who hates Susan for marrying her 
    father a fairly short time after her real mother <A HREF="house_hunting_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/house hunting 2012 poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>committed
     suicide. The feeling is mutual with Susan, as she and Emmy fight 
    constantly. We then switch to another family, Don Thomson (Art 
    LaFleur; <B><A HREF="blob_1988.htm">THE BLOB</A></B> - 1988), his 
    wife Leslie (Victoria Vance; <B><A HREF="skin_crawl_2007.htm">SKIN CRAWL</A></B> 
    - 2007) and twenty-something son Jason (Paul McGill), who is on 
    crutches ever since he broke his leg when he struck a deer with his 
    car. They are looking at a house that Don is not interested in 
    seeing, so Leslie and Jason accompany the female real estate agent 
    into the house while Don chain-smokes outside. A man known as 
    &quot;The Realtor&quot; (Jon Cobb) suddenly appears behind Don with 
    his dog and says it looks like he's not interested in this house. 
    When Don says no, he hands him a piece of paper that contains the 
    address of a house he is selling for an amazingly cheap price, as it 
    contains acres and acres of property. Don is extremely interested in 
    this house because it is just what he is looking for, a place away 
    from civilization, so he and his wife can get over the recent death 
    of their young daughter Lizzy (Emma Rayne Lyle), who passed away from 
    some unknown illness (Jason only cares about himself). It turns out 
    to be the same house Charlie and his family are about to look at. 
    Charlie and his family arrives first, but there in no one at the 
    house, yet the door is open and there's electronic boxes all over the 
    house that, when a button is pushed on top of it, The Realtor's 
    recorded voice says this house is perfect for the &quot;right&quot; 
    family. When Don and his family arrive a short time later, Charlie 
    and his family go to a sign on the outside of the property that has 
    The Realtor's phone number. They try to call the number, but, 
    wouldn't you know it, there's no cell phone service there. Since 
    Charlie is very interested in the house, he drives back to it and 
    nearly hits a bloody girl who darts in front of the car, causing 
    Charlie to smash his car into a tree. When Don hears the crash, he 
    and his family drive to Charlie's car and see the bloody girl, whose 
    name is Hanna (Rebekah Kennedy; <B><A HREF="#Creature2010">CREATURE</A></B> 
    - 2010), lying on the ground. Everyone gets into Don's SUV to take 
    Hanna to the hospital, but no matter where they drive, they always 
    seem to end up at the house. It's an endless loop, as Don tries going 
    in different directions (21 times!), but always ends up back at the 
    house. When his SUV runs out of gas at night, everyone decides to 
    stay at the house until morning, believing someone will arrive to the 
    house by then. Hanna doesn't want to go into the house and everyone 
    finally finds out why: Hanna's tongue has been cut out! They stay at 
    the house and discover that there are seven single-serve cans of beef 
    stew in the cupboard, exactly the amount for the seven people in the 
    house. They also discover warm shaving cream in the upstairs 
    bathroom, as if someone was about to shave. They search the house and 
    discover they are the only ones there, but everyone begins to see a 
    young boy staring at them from an upstairs window. When morning comes 
    and no one shows up, Don decides to walk to the nearest town to get 
    help. After being gone all day, a nearly frozen Don appears at the 
    front door. When he warms up by the fireplace, he tells everyone no 
    matter how far he walked in every direction, he didn't go anywhere, 
    the house was always a short distance away behind him. A month passes 
    (!) and both families are still at the house, realizing that they all 
    are trapped there, living every day exactly the same as the day 
    before. Every night they have a dinner of canned stew and the next 
    morning there are another seven cans of stew in the cupboard. 
    Everyone is on edge because they know no one is going to save them, 
    but the one most on edge is Leslie, who constantly sees Lizzy, as if 
    she's still alive. Lizzy whispers something into her mother's ear, 
    but she says she can't possibly do that. Then one day Lizzy appears 
    and whispers the same thing into Leslie's ear, only this time, she 
    agrees to do it to be with her daughter forever. Leslie hangs herself 
    outside the house on the porch and her dead body is found by Emmy, 
    who screams. Don blames Charlie and his family for his wife's death, 
    saying Susan always was confrontational with Leslie and that caused 
    her to kill herself. Jason's leg is nearly healed and he doesn't need 
    crutches anymore, so he takes a sexual interest in both Susan (who 
    flashes him her breasts and then slams the bathroom door) and Emmy. 
    It then becomes very obvious that nearly everyone is concealing 
    secrets about their lives, as only six cans of stew appear in the 
    cupboard and the shaving cream is always warm so the men can shave. I 
    won't get into specifics about the rest of the film; I'll only tell 
    you the important parts. Emmy finds a way to escape the house by 
    putting together a huge jigsaw puzzle she found in the house. The 
    completed puzzle shows Emmy facing the house, so Emmy walks backwards 
    away from the house and hears cars in the distance for the first 
    time. Before she can complete her journey, Jason appears and tries to 
    rape her, but Hanna saves her by hitting Jason across the head with a 
    piece of firewood, sending him to the ground and getting impaled in 
    the side by a protruding tree branch. Don, who has a pistol, takes 
    Charlie's family hostage when Jason tells him he was only trying to 
    stop a backwards walking Emmy from falling down and Hanna hit him for 
    no reason at all. Susan, who is a nurse, takes care of Jason's 
    serious wound and Don tells her if his son dies, they will, too. Don 
    ties everyone up and tries walking backwards outside, making it to 
    the mailbox a long distance away for the first time. He returns to 
    the house and tells Charlie that he now believes Emmy was telling the 
    truth about his son and Jason then tells his father that he didn't 
    break his leg hitting a deer, he actually hit a woman jogging at 
    night, killing her. So who was that woman? A photo in the house 
    reveals that it was The Realtor's wife! We then discover that The 
    Realtor shot and killed his young son and then killed himself by 
    putting the rifle under his chin and pulling the trigger because he 
    couldn't live without his wife. Don tells Charlie that they will all 
    leave the house together, but before he can untie Charlie's ropes 
    binding him, Susan appears and kills Don by planting a hatchet in his 
    back. Then the cans of meat stew no longer appear in the cupboard, so 
    Charlie decides to see if walking backwards will save him and his 
    family from starving to death. When Charlie is outside, he meets his 
    doppleganger, who tells him to go back to the house because Susan is 
    about to tell Emmy how her mother really died. When Charlie gets back 
    to the house, it is too late. Susan has already told Emmy that she 
    and her father were<A HREF="house_hunting_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/house hunting 2012 aka the wrong house amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    seeing each other long before her mother's suicide and rather than 
    facing a messy divorce, Charlie snuck up behind her mother and sliced 
    her throat with a straight razor, making it look like a suicide. 
    Charlie then kills Susan by bashing her over the head repeatedly with 
    a full can of stew (He discovers that Susan was taking the cans of 
    stew for herself!) and tells Emmy that they can escape the house 
    together, but Hanna must die first so she can't tell anyone what 
    happened. Emmy now has Don's pistol and she and Hanna run out of the 
    house and hide in the woods, only for Charlie to grab Hanna and kill 
    her by planting the hatchet in her chest. Emmy then shoots and kills 
    Charlie and runs away, where she is picked up by two families in two 
    cars. No matter how many times they drive to get help, they always 
    end up at the house. Yes the circular loop is happening again, only 
    Emmy is now in the role of Hanna. The film ends with the two families 
    entering the house, but Emmy refuses to go inside. The Realtor then 
    grabs Emmy in the car and cuts her tongue out with scissors! The 
    &quot;Circle Of Life&quot; now becomes the Circle Of Death, as 
    history repeats itself once more. I wonder what secrets these 
    families hold? I have to say I was quite impressed with the way this 
    film slowly begins to reveal everyones' secrets, thanks to tight 
    direction by Eric Hurt (his first feature film), who also wrote the 
    deeply involving screenplay. It wouldn't have worked without 
    excellent acting by everyone in the film, but Art LaFleur and Marc 
    Singer really stand out here, making their roles believable (I really 
    liked the section when Don meets his doppleganger, since the exact 
    doubles in this film are merely that person's conscience speaking to 
    them in physical form). The supernatural angle is never really fully 
    explained, but it didn't have to be because it's all about the 
    trapped people and the sins they have to pay for. I know every family 
    has their secrets, but the ones here are downright deadly and 
    everyone deserved their fates (except for Emmy and Hanna, who are 
    victims of circumstance). This film gets a big thumbs-up from me, as 
    I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised as the film 
    started to unfold. If you like films with twisty plots, you should 
    like this film, too. It's dark, but highly recommended. I saw this 
    streaming on Amazon Prime (under both titles), but you can also find 
    it streaming on YouTube from channel &quot;Viewster&quot;.</FONT></FONT></P>

    the Brian Keene novel of the same name (which I have not read), this 
    film takes place during the mid-1980's and centers on three boys, one 
    who just lost his beloved grandfather (an uncredited cameo by Barry 
    Corbin); one who is sexually abused by his alcoholic mother; and 
    another who is physically abused by his alcoholic father, who works 
    at the local graveyard and supplies both dead and live people to 
    something or someone that lives underground in a series of tunnels 
    under the cemetery. The film is more about monsters of the human 
    kind, although there are scenes of horror that take place 
    underground. Not bad for a TV movie and, for once, it doesn't rely on

    thriller where, 20 years earlier, we watch a British SWAT team kill a 
    serial killer of young girls by pumping at least 50 bullets in his 
    body. Twenty years later, a man named Luke (Danny Horn) is awoken by 
    a text message on his phone telling him it is time to get up. Along 
    with the text message is a video which the killer says, &quot;Find 
    the girl, find the truth&quot;, showing his girlfriend Chrissy dead 
    without eyes (they were plucked out by human fingers), the tip of her 
    tongue cut off and a knife wound under the heart that cut off every 
    artery to the organ, killing her immediately; a young girl that looks 
    scared; and indefinitely suspended police inspector Samantha (Charity 
    Wakefield) eating at a diner. Luke finds his girlfriend Chrissy 
    butchered in their bathtub and he runs away, thinking the police will 
    blame him for the murder. He meets Sam at the diner and introduces 
    himself by showing her the video that was sent to him. She 
    immediately goes into full-blown mental mode because the little girl 
    in the video was her sister Lucy (Bonnie Weddell) who was the serial 
    killer's last victim 22 years ago. When DNA comes back from Chrissy, 
    it is the same as the dead serial killer. Lucy and Sam must work 
    together to solve the mystery (Sam still has some friends on the 
    force, as well as enemies). Director/screenwriter Scott Michell keeps 
    you guessing till the end and shows that Sam has some real problems 
    in her life, such as a dead abusive dad and trying to get back in the 
    police force. Luke and Sam become lovers, which just makes the whole 
    ordeal more difficult (Love does not conquer all), as they 
    investigate by going to a sex party (where a prostitute is handed a 
    severed human hand through a glory hole) and other places that no 
    human in their right mind (which Sam is not) would go, while trying 
    to save little girl Zoe ( Lois Ellington), who is being held by the 
    killer and taunted by video. Luke ends up going to some 
    balloon-filled birthday party at an abandoned hospital, where two 
    other people wake up and don't know how they got there. The key is, 
    &quot;Don't play the hero, play the game&quot;. Those that don't end 
    up dead. It turns that Luke, Sam and the other two people are clones 
    of notorious serial killers, the only human clones ever produced 
    (Luke is the clone of the killer that murdered Sam's sister), but are 
    they capable of doing the same dastardly things as their originals? 
    It doesn't matter because a bunch of government officials have been 
    hired to &quot;Clean up the mess&quot;. To say anymore will be to 
    deprive you of a fantastic little thriller with a unique storyline;

    the wheelchair-bound Andy (Charlie Tahan; <B><A HREF="i_am_legend_2007.htm">I

    bedroom window. She is new in town since her parents died and she 
    wants a new friend, so she picks Andy. Mom does not approve and then 
    we realize that there is nothing wrong with Maryann, but the trouble 
    lies with overbearing mother Katherine, who yells, screams and 
    manhandles her son. (She even screws the bedroom window shut). She 
    does not want Andy to have any friends and she goes to MaryAnn's 
    grandparents (Played by Peter Fonda and Leslie Lyles) and tells them 
    not-so-politely that MaryAnn is to go nowhere near Andy. Grandpa 
    tells Katherine that all the little girl wants is to make new friends 
    since she was forced to move since her parents died, but Katherine 
    tells them it won't be Andy. Richard gave up his job as a nurse to 
    take care of Andy during the day, but he is also having an affair 
    with Sandra (Meadow Williams), a nurse from the hospital. Slowly, the 
    snoopy MaryAnn discovers the truth about Andy when she sneaks through 
    the basement window. In case you don't get it from the film's title, 
    Katherine and Richard stole a baby that is a genetic match for Andy 
    and they are using the fake Andy to use for organ transplants (such 
    as his appendix). The final transplant will be on their real son's 
    heart (He is kept in the basement in a room that looks like one you 
    would find in a hospital). Katherine wants to perform the heart 
    transplant today, since MaryAnn brought the Fake Andy (his real name 
    is Jason) down to the basement to meet Katherine &amp; Richard's real 
    son, but Richard is having nothing to do with it. He breaks open 
    Jason's bedroom window and lowers his fake son into a wheelbarrow 
    with Maryann at the handles. The fact is that there is nothing wrong 
    with Jason and he should be able to walk once he is off the drugs he 
    is to take to make him inambulatory. Richard goes down to the 
    basement, pulls the breathing tube out of his son's mouth, sets the 
    room on fire and lies down next to his son while the fire rages 
    around them. Katherine carries a portable moniter which give her the 
    vitals on her son and when she sees them all flatline, she runs 
    toward the house, goes down to the basement and is engulfed in flames 
    when the roof collapses. The next time we see Jason, he is playing 
    Little League with Maryann. It looks like grandma and grandpa adopted 
    him, too. While Shannon is his normal excellent self, the real 
    standout here is Samantha Morton. Her actions toward her fake son 
    makes a lot of sense since he would soon be dead when he had his 
    heart removed. She is so good in her role, you'll want to slap her in 
    the face several times and the way she talks and treats her fake son 
    is beyond child abuse. This is an excellent little thriller that will 
    captivate you from the first frame.; <B><A HREF="man_of_tai_chi_2013.htm">MAN
     OF TAI CHI</A></B> (2013) was a major theatrical disaster in U.S. 
    theaters, making a little more than $100,000 in two weeks on a $25 
    million budget. But that doesn't mean that it is a bad film. It is 
    basically one martial arts fight after another (fight choreography 
    and action direction by master Yuen Woo-Ping, who also has an 
    uncredited cameo) and is also the directorial debut of Keanu Reeves (<B><A HREF="knock_knock_2015.htm">KNOCK
     KNOCK</A></B> [2015]), who also stars in a rare bad guy role as 
    Donaka Mark, the owner of a private fight club where people pay to 
    watch it on TV and the Internet. Mark is a real prick, because when 
    one fighter refuses to kill another fighter, he comes out wearing a 
    black mask and snaps the loser's neck (In the beginning of the film, 
    Mark stabs a winner of a fight over and over in the stomach and then 
    slices his throat because he was an undercover cop). We are 
    introduced to 'Tiger' Chen Lin Hu (Tiger Chen, who worked with Reeves 
    doing stunts on <B><A HREF="matrix_reloaded_2003.htm">THE MATRIX RELOADED</A></B> 
    [2003] and <B><A HREF="matrix_revolutions_2003.htm">THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS</A></B> 
    [2003]), an excellent Tai Chi student of his sifu Master Yang (Yu 
    Hai). Mark tries to get Tiger to fight for his organization, but he 
    refuses because Tai Chi, as powerful as it is, was never meant to be 
    used for fighting. Tiger changes his mind when Master Yang's temple 
    is cited for various building infractions and has 30 days to get them 
    fixed or he has to move out. Tiger fights for Mark and wins every 
    televised fight (where the opponents don't have to be killed; those 
    fights are reserved for a specialized crowd) and pays for the temple 
    to be fixed. Then a corporation threatens to tear down the temple and 
    build condos on the land, so Tiger goes to city hall and gets help 
    from the beautiful Ching Sha (Ye Qing), who suggests since the temple 
    is over 600 years-old, he should get it certified as a historical 
    landmark. It is plain to see that Tiger and Ching are very soon going 
    to fall in love, but Master Yang hates that Tiger is using Tai Chi 
    for fighting and the Master teaches Tiger a new move when they fight 
    for dominance, which will come in useful later. The Master says that 
    he is disappointed in Tiger, but he is caught between a rock and a 
    hard place, because fighters never leave Mark's fight club alive. 
    There are literally dozens of very good martial arts fights (some 
    with the help of wire work), both in the ring and outside it. The 
    sub-story is about Inspector Suen Jing Si (Karen Mok), who wants to 
    capture Mark, but her corrupt boss Superintendent Wong (a long cameo 
    by Simon Yam; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Wake Of Death">WAKE OF DEATH</A></B> 
    [2004]), blocks her every move. Later in the film, Tiger joins forces 
    with Inspector Suen to bring Mark down, but one of Mark's gang tries 
    unsuccessfully to kill her. The finale finds Tiger and Mark fighting 
    to the death on the front grounds of Master Yang's temple (Mark says 
    to Tiger, &quot;You owe me a life!&quot;). Tiger uses the move Master 
    Yang used on him to kill Mark and the film ends on a happy note. 
    Reeves did a good job directing this film and it is plain to see that 
    he didn't have a stunt double in his final fight. He also had the 
    good sense to film the movie in Beijing, China and let the actors and 
    actresses speak their native Cantonese and Mandarin, using subtitles. 
    Some of the actors speak both their native tongue, as well as 
    English, so it doesn't overwhelm those idiots that say, &quot;If I 
    wanted to read, I would have bought a book!&quot; (Yes, there are 
    people like that out there.). Though there is really nothing new in 
    this film (the screenplay by Michael G. Cooney is reminiscent of 
    countless other martial arts films), the actors are amiable, the 
    fights plentiful and done well (Tiger snapping his separated shoulder 
    back into its joint is a highlight, but in the film he really 
    separated the other shoulder!) and the film in general is just fun to 
    watch, especially seeing Keanu Reeves as the bad guy. So far, this is 
    Reeves only directorial effort (Mainly because the boxoffice take, 
    but Warner Bros. didn't give it much of a publicity campaign and 
    basically used it as a throwaway film), but I hope he directs more in 
    the future. Recommended.; <B><A HREF="snowpiercer_2013.htm">SNOWPIERCER</A></B> 
    (2013) was one of those films that deserved a wide theatrical release 
    but instead got a limited theatrical/VOD release and most people 
    didn't see it until it hit disc and cable TV, even though it was on a 
    lot of critics &quot;10 Best&quot; lists for the year. The story is 
    complex, yet simple, too. An experiment causes the Earth to go into a 
    new Ice Age and the only people/animals left alive are on a 
    non-conventional train with a perpetual motion engine that travels 
    the Earth. The thing is, the further back you live on this huge 
    train, the lower class you are in, like the old Indian caste system. 
    Those who live in the back of the train are virtual slaves and 
    prepare for a revolution, but there are many obstacles in their way.

    - 2006) uses an international cast to very good effect and you will 
    absolutely hate Tilda Swinton after watching this one-of-a-kind 
    thrill ride. They sure don't make many movies like this and that's a 
    shame. I think it would have done well in a wide theatrical release 
    with the right advertising campaign, but since the Weinstein Brothers 
    were involved, consider yourself lucky that the film wasn't cut to 
    threads; If <B><A HREF="gravy_2013.htm">GRAVY</A></B> (2013) seems 
    like an extended episode of the late, lamented TV series <B><A HREF="psych_tv_series.htm">PSYCH</A></B> 
    (2006 - 2014), it is because it was directed and co-written by that 
    series' star, James Roday (who also puts in a cameo here late in the 
    film, along with unrecognizable series co-star Dul&eacute; Hill, as 
    paramedics). The difference here is that the film is extremely gory. 
    The similarities is the comical dialogue, which references many other 
    films and TV shows. Three people (Jimmi Simpson, Lily Cole and the 
    excellent Michael Weston) weld the front and back doors shut of a 
    closed-for-the-night restaurant/bar (it has no windows) on Halloween 
    Night and take all the employees hostage. They announce that they are 
    cannibals and they do this on every Halloween. They plan on eating 
    everyone and use different means to start killing the staff (Gabourey 
    Sidibe has her voice box bitten out and owner Paul Rodriguez has an 
    apple shoved in his mouth and then has a crossbow bolt shot into it 
    and stick out the back of his skull in a funny takeoff of William 
    Tell) and force the establishment's French chef (Lothaire Bluteau) to 
    prepare their flesh into different types of meals, which he does and 
    the meals taste excellent. To say any more will be to ruin one of the 
    most unusual horror comedies I have ever seen and it has an ending 
    that is completely satisfying. The real star here is Sutton Foster as 
    Kerry, one of the hostages, who fakes that she is in love with Weston 
    and look for Sarah Silverman in an extended cameo as the clerk of a 
    Quicky Mart. She is hilarious and I usually don't like her. This is 
    referenced in most internet sites and books as a 2015 production, but 
    the end credits give it a 2013 production date. I hope James Roday 
    makes more films. This one had me hooked from the beginning and I did 
    laugh out loud at a few of the kills, fights and jokes. Recommended.; <B><A HREF="green_inferno_2013.htm">THE
     GREEN INFERNO</A></B> (2013) is director/co-writer Eli Roth's long 
    gestating homage to the Italian cannibal films of the 70' &amp; 80's. 
    It played some festivals and in several foreign countries and then 
    sat on a shelf before getting a token limited theatrical/VOD release 
    in the United States in September 2015 and then quickly being dumped 
    on disc and pay cable (The same thing as the Eli Roth production of <B><A HREF="clown_2013.htm">CLOWN</A></B> 
    - 2013, which sat on the shelf in the U.S. [but not the rest of the 
    world] until it got a disc and streaming release in August 2016. It 
    is probably the greatest evil clown movie ever made.). The thing is, 
    this film deserved a much better fate and no matter what the horde of 
    Roth-hating fanboys say (the same geeks who speak their 
    chin-dribbling bile about Quentin Tarantino and Uwe Boll), this is an 
    intense and gore-filled tribute to a genre I grew up with (only with 
    no killing of real animals, thank God). The story is simple: A group 
    of American college activist students travel down the Amazon to save 
    the rain forest so the native's homes aren't destroyed (The film's 
    biggest mistake: How can a handful of students save the rain<A HREF="green_inferno_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/green inferno poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    forest? Even with media attention using camera phones posted on 
    YouTube?), only to discover that the civilization down there doesn't 
    quite abide by our rules. And that is putting it politely. One 
    college freshman girl, Justine (Lorenza Izzo; Roth's <B><A HREF="knock_knock_2015.htm">KNOCK
     KNOCK</A></B> - 2015), is seduced by college senior Alejandro (Ariel 
    Levy), into going down to the Amazon (he is currently protesting 
    janitors not getting paid their dues!); he and his group to save the 
    rain forest and she to stop the Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) of 
    women by ancient (and painful) means (Justine's father Charles, 
    played by Roth regular Richard Burgi, who is a U.N. lawyer hotshot, 
    is not pleased with her decision.). Once down in South America, 
    Alejandro turns out to be quite the prick, telling the group that 
    they will be going up against an armed militia and they will only be 
    armed with camera phones (It would have been nice for him to have 
    said something before they took the trip.). Once they get to their 
    destination by boat down the Amazon, they disguise themselves as the 
    deforestation crew and chain themselves to the machinery and trees, 
    wearing plastic masks, blue hardhats and yellow jumpsuits. Justine 
    has trouble locking her chain lock and she is put on her knees by a 
    militiaman with a gun pointed at her head. She then begins to know 
    who her friends are, as Alejandro blames the U.N. for causing this 
    destruction and another person in her group tells the gun-holding man 
    to kill her. Looks like Justine was set up from the beginning and 
    they knew about her U.N. lawyer father the whole time. I told you 
    Alejandro was a prick. Luckily, the militia doesn't shoot Justine. 
    They instead put all of them on boats and then on a plane to head 
    back home. As you can probably guess, the plane develops engine 
    trouble and crashes into the Amazon Jungle (they lose a couple of 
    people out of the back of the plane when the tail is ripped off [we 
    see one bloody dead female body stuck in a tree] and the pilot gets a 
    tree branch through the windshield into his head). Almost as soon as 
    they step out of the wrecked plane (one idiot walks into a 
    still-spinning propellor on the plane and kills himself), they are 
    shot with drug darts by a cannibal tribe after one girl gets a spear 
    through her neck and another one through the top of her head as she 
    is lying down. They are all taken to the cannibals' village by canoes 
    down the Amazon River and then the gory part begins. We see human 
    heads on pikes as they are led to the village, when the tribes' 
    female elder come out to inspect them. They are all put into a bamboo 
    cage except Jonah (Aaron Burns), who is given something special to 
    drink and is then laid down on a stone altar. What happens to him and 
    the rest of the students should be watched by the viewers and you 
    will be wondering how this film got away with an R-Rating. If you 
    want a good old-fashioned cannibal film (with some modern-day 
    devices), including a scene of the cannibal children laughing while 
    one of the women captives takes a runny shit in the bamboo cage, then 
    look no further. This one delivers in spades and doesn't portray the 
    cannibals as the bad guys (Alejandro is the biggest scumbag of all. 
    He jerks-off on front of his dead girlfriend to relieve his 
    pressure!). They are just doing what comes naturally and it is us who 
    are the intruders (Pay close attention to how they figure out that 
    Justine is a virgin of the female students and are going to attempt 
    to do to her what she came down there to protest against). Make sure 
    that you stay through the final credits for an important stinger. 
    Watching this film took me back 35 years when films like these were 
    common and made me squirm, so what more could you ask for? My highest 
    recommendation. Fuck the fanboys. This is a great film! If you want 
    to know what cannibals do when they get the munchies from eating 
    human meat laced with marijuana, this is the film to see! Not to be 
    confused with the film that ended the Italian cannibal craze, <B><A HREF="green_inferno_1988.htm">THE

     ASS</A></B> and I must say, besides one sequence, it is superior 
    than the original. Danny Trejo once again stars as Frank Vega and it 
    takes place three years after the first film. Frank now runs a boxing 
    gym and was made an honorary policeman (Patrick Fabian returns from 
    the first film as Officer Malark) and his next door neighbor is 
    Bernie Pope (Danny Glover), who runs a liquor store (Frank loves his 
    liquor!) and is agoraphobic and hasn't left the store for 25 years 
    (There's a funny/violent sequence where Bernie gets held-up by a 
    bunch of punks and Frank saves his ass [Bernie has a rare disease and 
    has six months to live if he doesn't get a new liver, but he is 
    considered too old by the medical transplant profession.] The 
    dialogue that follows will make you howl with laughter.). When one of 
    Frank's favorite young boxers, Manny Parkes (Jeremy Ray Valdez; he 
    considers Frank a second father), ends up being killed for dealing 
    drugs, Frank promises Manny's beautiful mother, Rosaria (Jacqueline 
    Obradors), and her young daughter, Julia (Melany Ochoa) that he will 
    find the killer (From the moment they meet, you just know that 
    Rosaria and Frank will become lovers, but their first kiss is always 
    interrupted by......well, it's better if you discover that 
    yourself.). When Frank is being attacked by the gang that killed 
    Manny (who are working for an Argentinian bigshot named Leandro 
    Herrera, played with pinache by Andrew Divoff), Bernie breaks out of 
    his agoraphobia and puts them all down with a hockey stick (Yes, I 
    know what you are saying: &quot;Black people don't play hockey!&quot;,
     but you have to listen to Bernie's explanation to believe it!). From 
    that point-on, Frank and Bernie become a geriatric vigilante squad, 
    beating up the minions of Leandro and doing it is such a funny and 
    violent way (Leandro's son gets the worst of it: an ice pick in the 
    eye and a college senior gets a little bit of his penis cut off, by 
    Frank and a rotating fan, looking for information on the bad guys. 
    Frank looks at his work and goes &quot;Mozel Tov!&quot;, while Bernie 
    is successfully hitting on a beautiful college girl). To tell you any 
    more about this film would be depriving you of some real fun and 
    bloody action as the two Danny's make a great pair and their witty 
    banter (such as when Bernie calls Frank a &quot;Mexican MacGyver&quot;
     when he gets them out of a particularly cold situation) is really 
    funny and doesn't seem forced. Also great here are Andrew Divoff, who 
    gets much more screen time than usual and his final words are a howl 
    (If you saw the first film, you will get what &quot;Amber Lamps&quot; 
    really means). There is only one real caveat: 90% of the chase 
    between Frank &amp; Bernie in a Ford Bronco and a helicopter shooting 
    at them at the end of the film is lifted from the Gene Hackman film <B><A HREF="narrow_margin_1990.htm">NARROW
     MARGIN</A></B> (1990) to save money. But don't let that stop you 
    from watching a really entertaining film. Director/screenwriter Craig 
    Moss returns from the first film and even made a third one, <B><A HREF="bad_ass_3_bad_asses_on_the_bayou_2015.htm">BAD

    films, I will be a happy man. Danny Trejo (who at the time of this 
    review was doing commercials for Sling TV) is 72 years-old and looks 
    like he can still kick anyone's ass. Now that he has a partner, you 
    get double the action, double the fun. Totally recommended.; While I

    that <B><A HREF="unidentified_2013.htm">UNIDENTIFIED</A></B> (2013), 
    a rare foray into feature filmmaking by disc label Dark Sky Films, 
    kept me captivated throughout. The reason why I liked it so much is 
    because director/screenwriter Jason R. Miller (his only feature film 
    to date) allows the characters to develop, <A HREF="unidentified_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/unidentified 2013 poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>giving
     this film an extra depth not usually found in films of this type. It 
    is all about four friends, Jeremy (Parry Shen; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hatchet2007">HATCHET</A></B> 
    - 2007 and its <A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HatchetIII2013">sequels</A>),
     Dave (Colton Dunn), Nick (Eddie Mui) and Jodie (Eric Artell, who 
    looks and talks so much like a young Topher Grace on <B><A HREF="that_70s_show_tv_series_1998-2006.htm">THAT
     '70S SHOW</A></B>, you'll watch the film thinking it was him!), who 
    take a weekend trip to Las Vegas and document it on digital video for 
    Jodie's blog (or so he says). They are driving to Vegas so Nick can 
    borrow $10,000 from a loan shark and play a private game of Poker in 
    a hotel room. Everyone thinks that Nick is a poker wizard, but after 
    they borrow the money, Dave tells everyone that the poker game he 
    signed Nick up for is for people with Down Syndrome! Nick has to 
    pretend he has Down's in order to get into the game (Where real Down 
    Syndrome actor Blair Williamson portrays the Head of the poker game). 
    Nick enters the game not knowing that some people with Down Syndrome 
    are savants with numbers and he loses his shirt (well, his leather 
    jacket!). Now owing the loan shark $10,000 in less than thirty 
    minutes, they hightail it back to their hotel room and hope to leave 
    Vegas before the loan shark (who Dave says has mob connections) 
    catches up with them. They quickly pack their bags, but, as they take 
    the stairs down, they find the loan shark waiting for them. Jodie 
    gives him a solid kick to the groin and they escape, deciding to take 
    back roads to lose him. This is where the film takes a dark turn. 
    They end up stranded in the middle of the desert (their car battery 
    has a huge melted hole in it) and they find out that they are not 
    alone. Jodie becomes infected with some black oily-like substance 
    (Shades of <B><A HREF="x_files_tv_1993_2002.htm">THE X-FILES</A></B>),
     starts wandering around on his own in a hypnotic-like trance and a 
    huge cyst appears on his back. Jeremy lances it with his pen knife 
    while Nick squeezes it (it is disgusting as it sounds). I'll leave 
    the rest for you to discover, but don't expect a happy ending. The 
    reason why I liked this film so much is that the actors have a 
    chemistry unlike most found footage films. Their dialogue is natural 
    sounding and doesn't feel forced. The film is also filled with little 
    bits of background scenes that telegraph things to come, but if you 
    don't pay attention, you will not see them (Especially the sequence 
    where they discover a crazy caped man in a deserted tract house town. 
    His fate is done so matter-of-factly, you'll miss it unless you are 
    eagle-eyed.). I find very few found footage films as good as this 
    one, so search it out if you get the chance.; <B><A HREF="redemption_2013.htm">REDEMPTION</A></B>

     JOE</A></B> - 2013) is not your usual Jason Statham movie. Sure, he 
    kicks a lot of ass, but that's not the point here. The point is no 
    matter how far from home you are, things stay the same. And when you 
    come back home, things are just as terrible as where you were, maybe 
    even worse. Statham portrays Joey, a soldier in the Afghanistan War, 
    who returns home to London and his PTSD forces him to lose his wife 
    and small daughter and live as a bum in an alley with Isabel 
    (Victoria Bewick). They are endlessly kicked and punched by punks who 
    get off hurting bums and one night they pick on Joey and Isabel. 
    After being beaten senseless, Joey manages to run away and breaks 
    into a high-end apartment owned by a man who is away for a couple of 
    months in his vacation house (one of the many examples of the have 
    and have-nots in the film). While Joey is cleaning himself up, taking 
    a shower and cutting his long stringy hair (and getting back in 
    fighting shape), a man with a scar above his eye kills Isabel. Joey 
    forms a friendship with a nun named Cristina (an amazing performance 
    by Agata Buzek), who teaches Joey how to be a man again, while he 
    teaches her how to be a woman again. Joey gets even with the punks 
    that beat up him and Isabel (and tells the other bums that they 
    should be safe now). but he needs a way to find out the name of the 
    man with the scar above his eye. He takes a job as a driver for an 
    important Chinese mobster to try and get information. While all this 
    is going on, it is apparent that Joey and Cristina are falling in 
    love, but Joey doesn't feel worthy of love. A lot of gut-grabbing 
    emotional scenes happen (I'll leave them for you to discover) and 
    when Joey discovers the name of the man who killed Isabel, he goes to 
    the party he is at on the roof of a high-rise and simply throws him 
    off, telling him that he will now feel what all the women he abused 
    felt (During the film, we see the man sexually battering a prostitute 
    in a brothel). Joey is now a fugitive bum in a tux and walks the 
    streets, while Cristina quits being a representative of God and goes 
    on to learn to be a woman again (something happened to her when she 
    was 10 years-old). Joey leaves her a note with some photos of himself 
    that she took and we then see police drones from above spotting Joey, 
    just like the drones did to the bad guys in Afghanistan. The more 
    things are different, the more they remain the same. Those looking 
    for a standard Jason Stathan fightfest are going to be bitterly 
    disappointed, because this film is more about living a life like many 
    returning soldiers do (and this must change ASAP!!!) and if it wasn't 
    for soup kitchens, they would have nothing at all to eat. Even though 
    there are a few brutal fight scenes, director/screenwriter Steven 
    Knight (Creator and Writer of TV's <B><A HREF="peaky_blinders_tv_series_2013.htm">PEAKY
     BLINDERS</A></B> [2013 - Present]) is more interested in the 
    lifestyle and mindset of a returning soldier and it is not pretty. 
    This is one of Jason Statham's best films and gives him a chance to 
    really act. You should give it a chance, too.; Sometimes I have to 
    ask myself why a good film never gets a theatrical release. Such is 
    the case with <B><A HREF="odd_thomas_2013.htm">ODD THOMAS</A></B> 
    (2013). It is based on a story by Dean Koontz, has a terrific 
    performance by the late Anton Yelchin (<B><A HREF="green_room_2015.htm">GREEN
     ROOM</A></B> - 2015) and wonderful direction by Stephen Sommers (<B><A HREF="mummy_1999.htm">THE
     MUMMY</A></B> - 1999) Yelchin is the title character (&quot;Odd&quot;
     is really his first name, due to a mistake at the hospital when he 
    was born) who has a special talent no one in the town, especially 
    Chief Wyatt Porter (an excellent Willem Dafoe) doubts: He can see the 
    dead and solve the crimes against them (We watch him do it to a 
    hit-and-run driver of a young dead girl, who is by his side the whole time<A HREF="odd_thomas_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/odd thomas dvd front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    and even walks on water in the pool!). There are two drawbacks to 
    seeing the dead. Number 1: They don't speak. Number 2: There are 
    creatures called &quot;Bodachs&quot;, that, if they know you can see 
    them, they will kill you. Odd sees this happen first hand to a friend 
    who saw one and gave it the middle finger. Things take a deadly turn 
    when Fungus Bob Robertson (Shuler Hensley) comes into town and he has 
    an army of Bodachs following him which only Odd can see and strange 
    things start happening in town: A group of faceless dead people grab 
    Odd while someone shoots an automatic weapon at him. The Chief is 
    shot and nearly killed. Odd and his girlfriend Stormy (Addison 
    Timlin) are chased into a church by a bunch of Bodachs. Odd comes to 
    the conclusion that someone is out to kill as many people as he can 
    by shooting the town up. Odd checks the Chief's laptop and gets more 
    than he paid for. Fungus Bob Robertson is shot through the heart, the 
    Bodachs disappers and Bob comes back from the dead to kill Odd and 
    blows up the Chief's house. Odd figures out it is all some sort of 
    police conspiracy and tries to stop it. Odd ends up at a big Mall 
    (where Stormy works as an ice cream girl) and it is flowing with 
    Bodachs (One which Odd stares at) and a gunman covered in bulletproof 
    armor begins shooting up the mall with an automatic weapon. Odd is 
    attacked by the Bodachs, but manages to shoot the masked gunman in 
    the head. Whewn he pulls off the mask, it is another local policeman. 
    Odd sees another dead friend, who leads him to a van that is filled 
    with explosives, so he hops in the van, after being shot by another 
    cop, to get it out of town and takes off, the resulting explosion is 
    one for the books. Most of the town (who don't know Odd's powers) 
    turn out at the hospital and treat him like a hero (which he is). Odd 
    kisses Stormy in his hospital bed, only to discover a short time 
    later from the Chief that she died in the shooting at the mall 
    (Having special powers always have a downside, especially since he 
    thought he would be with Stormy forever). This is a sadder than sad 
    ending for a film that is filled with weird humor and some terrific 
    visual effects. If they released this to theaters just after 
    Yelchin's untimely (and equally weird) death, it would have garnished 
    a cult following, which it so deserves. Yelchin is simply a 
    revelation here. I never expected him to be so good in a film I never 
    heard of before, yet he always makes me take notice of him no matter 
    what film he is in. Although Rated PG-13, it in no way hampers the 
    grusomeness of some of the scenes or the plot of the film (even 
    though I still don't know why four police officers would want to blow 
    up a small town). Try putting on this film some time. It may just fit.</FONT></FONT></P>

     the New Millennium) has fashioned a film from screenwriter Adam 
    Minarovich's script that tells several stories that are 
    interconnected by one thing: a stolen wedding ring. Customer Matt 
    Dillion walks into Vincent D'Onofrio's pawn shop, where he spots the 
    ring, and he knows immediately it was taken off his wife who 
    disappeared seven years earlier (he was about to get married again, 
    but tells his new bride-to-be to take a hike). This leads Dillon on a 
    hunt for who originally stole the ring and eventually he finds the 
    perpetrator (and dishes a little <B><A HREF="hellraiser_1987.htm">HELLRAISER</A></B> 
    [1987] justice on him) before making a shocking discovery. To tell 
    any more would be to ruin one of the best films of 2013 and one 
    wonders why films like this get limited theatrical/VOD releases, 
    while over-budgeted crap get wide theatrical releases. The 
    interconnected stories concern an Elvis Presley impersonator (the 
    wonderful Brendan Fraser, who always gets mistaken for a magician!) 
    who sells his soul to the Devil while performing in a Twilight Zone 
    town (where the entire film takes place and there are weird things 
    happening like dueling barber shops) that must be seen to be believed 
    (The town is some sort of Purgatory, which would explain a lot of 
    visual things going on in the film.); a gang of meth-head White 
    Supremacist thieves (led by Walker) out to rob a meth lab; a cult 
    leader (Elijah Wood) and his band of naked ladies and Dillon's search 
    for the original thief who stole the ring. All the stories get 
    wrapped-up in grandiose fashion and you will leave the film with a 
    crooked smile on your face. Norman Reedus, Chi McBride, DJ Qualls, 
    Lucas Haas, Thomas Jane, Sam Hennings, Ashlee Simpson and Kevin 
    Rankin all put in appearances and I suggest you search this film out 
    immediately. Fred Durst (<B><A HREF="play_dead_2009.htm">PLAY DEAD</A></B> 
    - 2009, another worthwhile DTV flick), one of the Executive 
    Producers, was slated to direct before Wayne Kramer took over; I was 
    sitting on the fence with <B><A HREF="colony_2013.htm">THE COLONY</A></B> 
    (2013), but it finally won me over with a few good twists and turns. 
    The basic plot is about in the near future, temperature change across 
    Earth has put it in a new Ice Age (take that you Republican 
    non-believers!), but a group of people hold out in a well-protected 
    fortress (an actual NORAD base) and try to survive as a family. 
    Unfortunately, some of them develop a deadly flu that is highly 
    contagious, which makes the leaders (Laurence Fishburne and Bill 
    Paxton) give the infected a choice: either take a bullet to the head 
    or take a walk out into the icy unknown for a future that is 
    uncertain (Paxton would just rather shoot them in the head so they 
    can't return and turns out to be the group's bad guy). Things turn to 
    shit when Fishburne and a group of survivors (including Kevin Zegers) 
    leave the fortress in search of food and other necessities of life 
    and run smack-dab into a bunch of feral cannibals, led by their huge 
    sharp-toothed leader (Dru Viergever), who is chopping up a human into 
    pieces for a feast later. Things happen where two of the major 
    characters are killed (one is really surprising) because the 
    cannibals follow Zeger back to the base. It's then &quot;us against 
    them&quot;, as the cannibals attack the fortress and Zegers has to 
    take out the leader (in extremely grisly fashion). While nothing 
    really special, it does have a good sense of atmosphere (you actually 
    feel cold while watching it) and the acting is better than it has any 
    right to be. It is one of those films that played theatrically and on 
    VOD at the same time before quickly turning up on the Starz Network.

    (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="intersections_2013.htm">INTERSECTIONS</A></B> -

    important as the story. Scott (Frank Grillo; <B><A HREF="homefront_2013.htm">HOMEFRONT</A></B> 
    - 2013) and Taylor (Jaimie Alexander; TV's <B><A HREF="blindspot_tv_series_2015.htm">BLINDSPOT</A></B> 
    - 2015 - Present) are on their honeymoon, taking a helicopter to an 
    out-of-the-way expensive hotel in the Moroccan desert. Also waiting 
    for Taylor is her lover Travis (Charlie Bewley) and, on their 
    honeymoon night, Taylor sneeks out for some nookie with Travis. The 
    next day, Scatt and Taylor are taking a Land Rover to do some desert 
    sightseeing, when Travis speeds up behind them in his own SUV and 
    tries to run them off the dirt road. It becomes a fast-moving car 
    chase and when their Land Rover jumps a hill, Scott and Talor don't 
    see what is on the other side of the hill: A stalled car containing a 
    woman named Audrey (Marie-Jos&eacute;e Croze; <B><A HREF="taking_lives_2004.htm">TAKING
     LIVES</A></B> - 2004), her baby and her male friend, and an empty 
    bus driven by the dangerous Omar (Moussa Maaskri; the French Parkour 
    film <B><A HREF="district_13_ultimatum_2009.htm">DISTRICT 13: ULTIMATUM</A></B> 
    - 2009). The Land Rover hits both the bus and the car at full speed 
    (it is a spectacular collision), followed by Travis and his SUV, who 
    also hits everyone at full speed.&nbsp; Scott manages to get out of 
    his car and free Audrey and her baby. Taylor also gets out and, 
    instead of trying to help people, starts taking photos with her 
    expensive digital camera, which upsets Omar, who pulls the camera out 
    of her hands and smashes it to the ground (Omar has been killing a 
    person on the bus when it was hit). Audrey's friend is impaled behind 
    the wheel of the car, so Scott tries to free him. Omar sees the car 
    is leaking gas, so he lights a cigarette, smokes some of it and 
    throws it in the path of the oncoming gas. The car erupts in flames 
    and Omar (who only speaks English when it suits him) kills the guy 
    with a wooden crutch by hitting him in the head over and over. Enter 
    Saleh (French actor/director Roschdy Zem, who is great here), who we 
    see tuck a pistol away in an ankle holster and then comes over the 
    hill to see if everyone is OK. The only person not dead or on their 
    feet is Travis, who was knocked unconscious from the impact. At this 
    point in the film, we find out that the only innocent person in this 
    crowd is the baby, as there are double and triple crosses galore. 
    Thankfully, it all makes sense and director/screenwriter David 
    Marconi (his only other directorial credit is <B><A HREF="harvest_1992.htm">THE
     HARVEST</A></B> [1992], another excellent thriller starring the late 
    Miguel Ferrer) uses the Morocco scenery better than most people 
    would. It is also a character in the film. He also makes sure the 
    film ends on a high note, as the worst people in the lot get what 
    they deserve and the final shot is of someone picking up the memory 
    card from Taylor's camera and during the end credits, we see what was 
    on the memory card. To tell you any more will deprive you of a neat 
    thriller that doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator. In 
    this film, people have to be bad guys to do good things and we 
    understand that once we get to the finale. This French production 
    (filmed in English, French and Arabic) is highly recommended.; <B><A HREF="monkeys_paw_2013.htm">THE
     MONKEY'S PAW</A></B> (2013) has been filmed so many times in so many 
    variations, that one would think it would be downright impossible to 
    make another good film based on the premise (the paw grants you three 
    wishes; wishes that usually come back to bite you in the ass), but 
    this Chiller TV original film manages to put a lot of thought into 
    this atmospheric New Orleans-set horror flick and the main asset is 
    actor Stephen Lang as factory worker Tony Cobb. Cobb's best friend 
    and fellow worker Jake Tilton (C.J. Thomason) receives the monkey's 
    paw from old-timer Gillespie (Daniel Hugh Kelly) and doesn't believe 
    the story behind the paw, so he wishes for a new car. Blammo, Jake 
    suddenly has a new car and he and Tony go for a ride, only for Jake 
    to swerve the car in order not to hit a crocodile crossing the road 
    and the car hits a tree, throwing Cobb through the front window and 
    killing him. Jake uses his second wish to bring Cobb back to life. 
    Big mistake. Wishes come with a price. Cobb (who begins decomposing 
    and has no soul) ends up chasing Jake around town to obtain the 
    monkey's paw, killing anyone who gets in his way (some of it is 
    pretty graphic for non-pay cable, but I'm sure there will be more 
    gore in the eventual Blu-Ray/DVD release, because it is easy to see 
    some of the more gory stuff was timed to happen just before the 
    commercial breaks). How will the third wish be used? I'm afraid 
    you'll have to watch the film to find out. Look for small roles by 
    Charles S. Dutton and Corbin Bleu. Director Brett Simmons (<B><A HREF="husk_2011.htm">HUSK</A></B>

    the most part it is a fairly gripping little jump scare film that 
    deserved a much better fate at the boxoffice. A financially-strapped 
    family, headed by Daniel (Josh Hamilton) and Lacy (Keri Russell) 
    begin to experience some unexplainable things in their house at night 
    with their two young boys, Jesse (Dakota Goyo) and Sam (Kadan 
    Rockett), such as all the family pictures removed from their frames, 
    unexplained sleepwalking, nosebleeds, rashes behind their ears and 
    unexplained symbols on Sam's body. When a flock of four different 
    species of 800 birds fly themselves into their house and die and the 
    CDC and police are absolutely no help, Lacy goes on the internet and 
    finds out that these are all signs that one of her family is about to 
    be abducted by aliens. A local expert named Edwin Pollard (an 
    excellent J.K. Simmons) explains to the exasperated Daniel and Lacy 
    what is going on (the rashes behind their ears are the after-effects 
    of having trackers installed), so Daniel installs night-imaging 
    cameras in all the rooms in hope of spotting one of these 
    &quot;Grays&quot; at night. What he finds is much more than I can 
    explain here. There are no pat answers, but could there ever be? A 
    spine-tingling final scene will make the hairs on the back of your 
    neck stand up. Don't let the PG-13 Rating fool you, this is pretty

    the slam of the shotgun butt on his noggin has given Simon amnesia 
    (or has it?) and they take him to hypnotherapist Elizabeth (Rosario 
    Dawson) to hypnotize him into telling them where he hid the painting. 
    I'm not going to divulge anymore, because it would deprive you of one 
    of the most unusual films of 2013. Just let me say there is a scene 
    that will make you sit up and notice and if you don't want to see a

    gang invade the island looking for a plane that went down in the 
    waters nearby that was carrying a fortune in heroin. Henry and Clay 
    manage to kill all but two of the gang and a plot point three 
    quarters through the film will take you by surprise. Van Damme looks 
    like he is having the time of his life, with his dyed blond 
    semi-permed hair and vegan attitude (He explains to the border guards 
    in the beginning of the film that he refuses to wear leather and that 
    cow farts contribute one quarter of the planet's methane pollution in 
    the atmosphere before he kills them all and then tells Old Man

    after French singer Edith Piaf!] until his grandmaother cooked her 
    for dinner. Xander tells Sanderson that was the day he became a vegan

    heart) and would rather use a knife than a gun because it is more 
    Earth friendly (&quot;Think about our carbon footprints. Think about

    TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE PART 2</A></B> - 1986), when Sam starts to 
    notice that she has a severe rash between her legs and she starts 
    peeing blood. Alice calls and tells Sam that a man at her party is 
    being searched for by the police and Sam automatically knows it was 
    the man she had sex with at the party. Sam goes to a doctor (Ruben 
    Pla) to have her sever rash looked at and by the look on the doctor's 
    face, he knows something that Sam doesn't know. He asks he when whas 
    the last time she was with a man and she tells hin two days ago, but 
    she is a lesbian. The doctor tells Sam that if she is going to lie to 
    him, she will never get better, but she swears that she only had sex 
    with a man two days ago and the last time before that was eight 
    months ago. The doctor tells her to put some lotion on the rash, but 
    he knows more than he is telling her. Sam begins to get much worse 
    symptoms. One of her eyes turns blood red, she starts hearing loud 
    noises, her fingernails fall out, her back teeth begin to fall out, 
    she can't feel steaming hot water in the bathtub and her hair begins 
    to fall out. Mom believes Sam is back on hard drugs again, but what 
    she has is much, much worse. Her boss George (E-Kan Soong) at the 
    restaurant has nothing better to do than fire her as a waitress, 
    since one of her fingernails was found in a customer's salad. Sam 
    goes back to the doctor and he is shocked at what he sees, but he 
    says that the tests he took haven't come back yet, He wonders if it 
    could be an STD or worse and tells her to stay away from all people 
    until his tests come back. She goes to her old drug dealer, Zain 
    (Charley Koontz), to get high and Alice sees Sam in Zain's house. Sam 
    tells Alice that she slept with BJ and Alice wants to take her to the 
    police, but Alice begins to go mental and accuses Alice of trying to 
    get into her pants (so far for following doctor's orders!). What 
    happens next is best left for you to discover since

    2015) makes Sam as ugly as possible and she starts killing all the 
    people she knows, beginning with Nikki and Alice, taking nice bites 
    out of their necks. To tell you any more will deprive you of one one 
    of the weirdest endings you are likely to see in a film in quite a 
    while. Be aware that there is a sequel to this film, <B><A HREF="contracted_phase_2_2015.htm">CONTRACTED
     PHASE II</A></B> (2015), but since it wasn't directed or written by 
    Eric England, it really isn't worth your time. It is just basically a 
    sex reversal on the original film, with Sam's last fuck, Riley (Matt 
    Mercer, returning from the first film, and a short cameo by Samantha 
    during the last few moments of the first film), taking over to spread 
    the contagion.; I have been hearing extremely good things about <B><A HREF="babadook_2013.htm">THE
     BABADOOK</A></B> (2013), so I decided to see if all the hype was 
    worth it. I am happy to report that it was, and this may be my 
    favorite supernatural film of the New Millennium, Really, it is that 
    good. It slams the haunted house, monster and possession genres on 
    their heads and gives them concussions. Bad for the genres, good for 
    us. The film opens with the husband of Amelia (Essie Davis) dying in 
    a car accident while trying to get his pregnant wife to the hospital. 
    Over six years pass and the child, Samuel (Noah Wiseman, who deserves 
    some type of award for making us hate him and then making us feel 
    sorry for him), weeks away from his seventh birthday, is a troulbled 
    child, overactive and a problem with other children at his school. He 
    is such a problem, that the Principal wants to assign Samuel an adult 
    monitor for when he's around the other school kids, but Amelia pulls 
    him out of the school, telling the Principal and one of the teachers 
    that she will find another school that understands how special Samuel 
    really is (Samuel is so blunt, he tells a complete stranger that he 
    has no father because he died driving his mother to the hospital to 
    deliver him!). Sam likes his mother to read him bedtime stories and <A HREF="babadook_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/babadook poster6 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Sam
     pulls out a pop-up book called &quot;Mister Babadook&quot; (man, I 
    would love to get my hands on a copy of that book!). It starts out 
    innocent enough, but with every page turned it gets creepier and 
    creepier (the way this scene is filmed will give you the chills) 
    until is shows a creepy monster in a top hat that says if you hear 
    three knocks and let him in, he will never leave (and the last half 
    of the book is completely empty). Amelia takes the book and hides it 
    on top of a tall cabinet, out of the way of Sam's sight. It seems 
    that Amelia does hold some blame on Sam for the death of her husband, 
    but she deals with it in her own way, without hurting Sam. Strange 
    things begin happening in the house and Sam is also a quite ingenious 
    inventor, making a couple of weapons that he thinks will keep 
    monsters away. Amiela begins to lose all her adult friends thanks to 
    the actions of Sam, who beats up the daughter of one of her female 
    friends and all the other female adults have husbands, so she now 
    wants nothing to do with them. The only friend of Amelia and Sam is 
    kind and elderly Mrs. Roach (Barbara West), who watches Sam (Amelia 
    hasn't found him a school yet) while Amelia is at work at an old age 
    home. Mrs. Roach's hands also shake because she has the onset of MS. 
    When the house becomes infested with roaches (I know what you are 
    thinking, but Mrs. Roach has nothing to do with it) and Amelia finds 
    a hole in the wall behind the refrigerator with roaches pouring out 
    of it, she is visited by two uptight people from Child Services, who 
    want to know why Sam is not in school yet. Amelia tells them about 
    the roaches in the hole in the wall, but when they all go to the 
    kitchen, the hole is no longer there. The Child Services people tell 
    Amelia that they will be back in a week with some schools that Sam 
    should attend (or she may lose him for good). The straw that breaks 
    the camel's back is when Sam goes into the basement and throws all 
    the items in his deceased father's box all over the floor and defaces 
    a photo of Amelia with her husband. When Amelia sees what Sam has 
    done, she tears up the &quot;Mister Babadook&quot; book and throws it 
    in the outside garbage. The next day, she hears three knocks at her 
    front door, but when she opens it, no one is there. She walks away 
    and hears the three knocks again, only louder and creepier. She opens 
    the door and finds the &quot;Mister Babadook&quot; book on the 
    ground. Someone (or something) has taped back all the torn pages 
    together and the second half of the book is now complete with more 
    pop-ups, showing Amelia snapping the neck of their pet dog, slitting 
    Sam's throat and, finally, Amelia taking her own life with red paper 
    (representing blood) flowing from her neck (Whomever created this 
    book is an absolute genius!). If this scene doesn't scare the shit 
    out of you, you either have opiod constipation or have your eyes 
    closed! To tell you any more would be to deprive you of one of the 
    greatest supernatural films of the New Millennium. I thought I 
    couldn't be scared anymore, but this film proved me wrong. 
    Director/screenwriter Jennifer Kent ups the terror factor by using 
    footage on TV of silent and sound films by the likes of&nbsp; Georges 
    M&eacute;li&egrave;s (One of his films is titled <B><A HREF="four_heads_are_better_than_one_1898.htm">FOUR
     HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE</A></B> and it was made in 1898!), Segundo 
    de Chom&oacute;n, Rupert Julian, Lewis Milestone, Herk Harvey (<B><A HREF="carnival_of_souls_1962.htm">CARNIVAL
     OF SOULS</A></B> - 1962) and Mario Bava (&quot;The Drop Of 
    Water&quot; episode of <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackSabbath1963">BLACK
     SABBATH</A></B> - 1963, which is appropriate if you have seen Bava's 
    film) and seemlessly inserting The Babadook into the footage. Kent 
    also purposely leaves the ending ambiguous because there are only two 
    ways this film can really end and once you see the final 15 minutes, 
    you should have your mind made up how you think it will conclude. The 
    word &quot;BABADOOK&quot; is also an anagram for a three word 
    statement and fits the film perfectly. This was Jennifer Kent's first 
    feature film (at the time of this writing), but she is certainly a 
    force to keep an eye on in the future. My highest recommedation, 
    especially for people who love to be scared and creative use of 
    cameras to make us see more than we ever thought we could see (such 
    as Amelia falling into her bed in slow motion, where regular objects 
    take on other meanings).; <B><A HREF="at_the_devils_door_2013.htm">AT 
    THE DEVIL'S DOOR</A></B> (2013) is another splendid supernatural 
    horror film from director/screenwriter Nicholas McCarthy, who also 
    gave us the excellent <B><A HREF="pact_2011.htm">THE PACT</A></B> 
    (2011). Hannah (Ashley Rickards) and boyfriend Calvin (Nick Eversman) 
    go to a trailer in the middle of the desert occupied my Uncle Mike 
    (the late Michael Massee), who is some kind of occult medium. Hannah 
    sits opposite Uncle Mike and he asks her to reach into a box with a 
    hole in the top and pick out an object in it. She picks a &quot;Smiley
     Face&quot; yellow button and Uncle Mike puts it under one of three 
    paper cups. As in the old &quot;three card monty&quot; game, he 
    switches the cups around and around and she picks the right cup with 
    the Smiley Face button on it three times in a row, only this time the 
    button is marked with a black &quot;X&quot; across the Smiley Face. 
    Since Hannah was able to keep her eye on the button and quessed 
    correctly three times, Uncle Monty gives her a roll of money ($500 
    worth) and says she can keep it as long as she goes to where the two 
    roads meet (another &quot;X&quot;) and say her name. Hannah asks why 
    and Uncle Monty tells her &quot;So he knows your name when he calls 
    for you. You are the vessel of the left hand path and one day he will 
    come. You'll be perfect.&quot; Hannah takes the money and does what 
    Uncle Mike says (off-screen) and soon her life is literally a living 
    hell, at least for a short time in this life, but forever in an 
    extremely hot place. (I must mention here, that besides the title, 
    the Devil's name is not mentioned once.). While Hannah is alone in 
    her house and listening to records a creepy doll hanging on her door 
    is suddenly gone and Hannah is picked up into the air by an unseen 
    force and thrown around like a, well, doll. She then is in the air 
    and we hear her back break, the unseen entity then throwing her 
    against the wall dead. Or is she? The newspapers report Hannah's 
    death as a suicide and no investigation by the police was performed. 
    We then listen to a radio talk show host tell us how in today's 
    society it is hard for young people to get ahead and make a life for 
    one's self. We then meet Leigh (Catalina Sandino Moreno), a real 
    estate broker who is finding it difficult to sell houses in today's 
    economy. Her sister, Vera (Naya Rivera) is an artist who is about to 
    have an art showing during the weekend and has a boyfriend named Sam 
    (Wyatt Russell), who is a total dick. The house Hannah lived in is 
    now up for sale by Hannah's parents (the father is played by horror 
    icon Daniel Roebuck [<B><A HREF="phantasm_ravager_2016.htm">PHANTASM: RAVAGER</A></B> 
    - 2016]), so Leigh takes a look at it and finds the roll of $500 
    tucked in the back of a bureau drawer. Instead of taking it, she puts 
    it back in the drawer and goes to leave the house, but a young woman 
    runs by her and then disappears. Could this be Hannah or the parents' 
    other daughter Charlene (Olivia Crocicchia), who disappeared with her 
    boyfriend a couple of months before? It becomes apparent after a 
    short time that the house is haunted by a possessed Hannah (who 
    sometimes wears a red raincoat, which is a tip of the hat to <B><A HREF="dont_look_now_1973.htm">DON'T
     LOOK NOW</A></B> - 1973) and Leigh, who knows the history of the 
    house, tries her best to help Charlene, but there are many bumps 
    along the way. The biggest bump is that Charlene is not Charlene but 
    a possessed Hannah (&quot;You weren't born in my world!&quot;), who 
    procedes to kill Leigh (The coroner tells Vera that Leigh's heart 
    just stopped, but Vera has a hard time believing that her 29 year-old 
    sister died of a heart attack and begins an investigation of her own, 
    which doesn't go where you think it will.). The rest of the bumps are 
    best for the viewer to discover and some of them are bound to give 
    you chills for weeks to come. If I say any more about this film, it 
    would give away the plot of a story that takes a left every time you 
    think it is going to take a right, Director/screenwriter Nicholas 
    McCarthy (who dedicates this film to Jess Franco) is a force to watch 
    out for in the future. His direction is fluid and his screenplays are 
    written with care and plenty of suspense. You can't ask much more of 
    a filmmaker than that. Highly recommended. Oh, and one other thing:

    about new teacher Liz Batho (Louise Griffiths), who is actually the 
    17th Century Countess Elizabeth Bathory, who bathed in the blood of 
    over 600 female virgins to keep her eternal youth. Here in high 
    school, Liz does her hardest to keep her pupils chaste and as soon as

    (screenplay by Lotti Pharriss Knowles, who also Produced) is crisp, 
    relevant and actually funny. Director John V. Knowles (his first 
    full-length feature) does a great job of keeping the film moving at a 
    brisk pace and never bores the viewer. I usually don't care for

     PROOF</A></B> - 2007) wake up in a strange building and are forced 
    to fight each other by the dastardly Elizabeth (an overweight

    the Internet to high-paying customers), and her husband and Master of

    They are forced to fight, otherwise their loved ones, including 
    parents and children, will be gunned down in the streets (the losers 
    of each bout also have their family killed). Sabrina is fighting for 
    the life of her daughter, but refuses to show emotion to vicious 
    guard Kurtz (Bruce Thomas). The fights are ferocious and bloody, as 
    limbs are broken, eyes are gouged out and necks are snapped. Sabrina 
    finds herself the champion of all the women (especially the into-it 
    Phoebe, played by Rebecca Marshall, who relishes each fight she is 
    in) until she and the final female fighter Jamie (Rachel Nichols) 
    turn the tables on their captors, in a bloody free-for-all that will 
    have you rooting for Sabrina, as she fights Elizabeth, Joseph, the 
    male guards (Kurtz gets a real beatdown, followed by a well-deserved 
    knife up the chin) and coroners, first by non-traditional weapons (a 
    stick with barbed wire wrapped around it, a mace with two swinging 
    metal balls at the end) and then by gun, until the unexpected 
    nihilistic ending. I could have done without the ending, but the film 
    is a non-stop action fest and director Josh C. Waller (<B><A HREF="mccanick_2013.htm">McCANICK</A></B>

    she's not a traditional beauty, she's my idea of the perfect woman. 
    This film has flaws, but you'll be glued to your seat. Isn't that 
    what movies were made for? It had a quick simultaneous one week 
    theatrical/VOD release before being quickly dumped on disc and cable

     BAY</A></B> [2012] are others]. Clif Prowse and Derek Lee (who both 
    also direct and wrote this film) portray fictionalized versions of 
    themselves. Clif is a documentarian and Derek is his best friend, who 
    has an aneurism on his brain that could rupture at any time. They 
    decide to take a year-long trip around the world and document their 
    travels on a website on the Internet. They first travel to Spain, 
    where they meet up with two friends, who are a band called 
    &quot;Unalaska&quot; (Edo Van Breemen and Zach Gray). They then 
    follow their friends to their next gig in Paris, France, where Derek 
    hooks-up with a woman named Audrey (Baya Rehaz) and they go off to a 
    hotel room to have sex. Clif and his two band friends think it would 
    be funny to &quot;cockblock&quot; Derek, so they burst into the hotel 
    room, only to find Derek unconscious, a gash on his head and what 
    looks like a bite mark on his upper left arm. Derek declines to go to 
    a hospital (he's afraid that because of the aneurism in his brain, 
    they will not let him leave), so Clif and Derek leave their band 
    friends and travel to Italy. That is where things begin to get weird. 
    Derek sleeps for a couple of days as soon as they enter their hotel 
    room and when he awakens, he is starving, so they go to an Italian 
    restaurant, where Derek takes one bite of his food and then proceeds 
    to puke more than you would see in a Monty Python film. He also 
    discovers that he has super strength (Clif documents him snapping a 
    huge boulder in two with one hit), the ability to climb walls and 
    jump superhuman distances and a need to drink human blood. Is Derek 
    now a vampire? I won't tell. He does head back to Paris (sans Clif; 
    but you'll discover why if you watch through the end credits) to 
    search out Audrey, as his appearance and hunger for blood continue to 
    increase. In the end, Derek finds an ingenoius way to deal with his 
    new affliction. Although there is some shakey-cam footage on view, 
    directors Prowse and Lee find some ingenious ways to use it, such as 
    when Derek is chased down Paris streets with the police firing their 
    guns at him (Derek wears a camera mounted on his vest and his 
    documentation of a policeman falling off a roof and landing on the 
    pavement below will leave you wondering how that effect was achieved) 
    or the very bloody scene where the French police raid the hideout 
    Derek is residing in, resulting in the death of all the police 
    personnel involved (including torn-out throats and other gory 
    mayhem). The film manages to hold your<A HREF="assault_on_wall_street_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/assault on wall street poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    attention because you care about what happens to Derek and far too 
    many found footage films don't offer us that. Filmed on location on a 
    budget of $318,000.00. Give it a try. You may just find yourself 
    liking it.; <B><A HREF="assault_on_wall_street_2013.htm">ASSAULT ON 
    WALL STREET</A></B> (2013) proves once again that director/writer Uwe 
    Boll can make a good, involving thriller if he takes the time and 
    keeps humor out of the equation. The story is about Jim Baxford 
    (Dominic Purcell), a nice guy with a good job who loses everything 
    when his life savings is lost in a Wall Street crash. His wife is 
    very sick, he is about to lose his house and suddenly finds himself 
    owing $60,000, so he goes to a lawyer (played by a sleazy Eric 
    Roberts), who wants $10,000 to take his case and promises to get him 
    his money back. Jim borrows to money from fellow worker and friend 
    Sean (a useless role for Boll regular Edward Furlong) and gives it to 
    the lawyer, who does absolutely nothing to help Jim with his problem. 
    When Jim's wife commits suicide, loses the house and then his job, 
    Jim goes to a gun dealer (a cameo by Boll regular Clint Howard) and 
    goes on a killing spree, first using a sniper rifle to pick-off Wall 
    Street executives from a distance and then using pistols and 
    automatic rifles to kill executives at the office of the firm that 
    lost all his money (headed by John Heard). Boll does a lot with a 
    little here and some of the violence is shocking and, just like 
    Brendan Fletcher in Boll's excellent <B><A HREF="rampage_2009.htm">RAMPAGE</A></B> 
    (2009), Jim has an exit strategy that lets him get away with it all. 
    Look for an appearance by Boll regular Michael Par&eacute;, as well 
    as turns by Keith David, Lochlyn Munro (what he says to Jim as he 
    gets into a cab will have your blood boiling), Erin Karpluk and Jerry 
    Trimble. Boll is impressing me as a director, as long as he stays 
    away from comedy (such as the embarrassing <B><A HREF="blubberella_2010.htm">BLUBBERELLA</A></B> 
    - 2010) and this film will hold your attention from beginning to end. 
    Think of this as the <B><A HREF="falling_down_1993.htm">FALLING DOWN</A></B> 
    (1993) of a new generation; <B><A HREF="wolves_2013.htm">WOLVES</A></B> 
    (2013) is a pretty effective werewolf tale that was made in Canada. 
    It tells the tale of teenager Cayden Richards (Lucas Hill), who knows 
    that he is different from most teenagers (an incident at a local high 
    school football game proves that) and when he is accused of viciously 
    slaughtering his adoptive parents, he hightails it out of town on his 
    motorcycle and ends up in the town of Lupine Ridge, thanks to a 
    run-in at a bar with Wild Joe (John Pyper-Ferguson). In this new 
    town, Cayden meets his Uncle John (a wonderful Stephen McHattie [<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#DeathValley1981">DEATH
     VALLEY</A></B> - 1981], who tells Cayden that &quot;Lupine&quot; 
    does not mean &quot;wolf&quot;, but &quot;wolf-like&quot;) and bar 
    owner Angeline (Merritt Patterson), who will eventually become his 
    love interest. He also finds out that his real father, Connor (Jason 
    Momoa), runs the town, is the leader of a pack of werewolves and 
    Cayden has inherited his condition. This leads to a lot of fights and 
    chases (all done particularly well, without resorting to use that 
    quick editing that is so popular today), as Uncle John, Cayden and 
    Angeline must find a way to stop Connor from killing more innocent 
    people. Wild Joe also plays an important part in the explosive finale 
    and the film is left wide-open for what I hope will be an eventual 
    sequel. Thankfully, the CGI is kept to a minimum and the werewolf 
    effects are done practically (by Mark Ahee and his crew) and done 
    very well. There are some gory killings (mainly torn-out throats and 
    views of severed body parts), but there is a real sense of family 
    between Uncle John and Cayden that you don't see in most horror films 
    of this type. Director/writer David Hayter (his first feature film 
    and, hopefully, not his last), imbues even the bad guys with a sense 
    of humanity and the film moves at a brisk pace. My eyes were glued to 
    the screen from the first frame to the last. Some wire work was 
    utilized for some of the stunts and they are used to good effect. 
    All-in-all, a good horror film to watch when your are in the mood for 
    werewolves; <B><A HREF="lost_river_2014.htm">LOST RIVER</A></B> 
    (2013) is called &quot;dark&quot; by some critics, but I call it 
    black. Not black as you can't see anything, but black as in the 
    shadowiest adult fairy tales you are ever likely to see. The fact 
    that it is the first directorial effort by actor Ryan Gosling, makes 
    it all the more amazing. Gosling, who I have liked after seeing him 
    in Nicholas Winding Refn's <B><A HREF="drive_2011.htm">DRIVE</A></B> 
    (2011), makes even the most widest of spaces seem confining and fills 
    it with both characters you either hate or love (there is no middle 
    ground). I won't destroy what is going to probably be your weirdest 
    experiences of 2014, except to say, there's a Grand Guignol-like 
    theater, people pedal around on neon-lit bicycles and Saoirse Ronan 
    has to take care of her catatonic grandmother, played by an 
    unrecognizable Barbara Steele, by playing old home movies of her and 
    her dead husband, who died when a town was submerged to make a 
    reservoir and called the new town &quot;Lost River&quot;, which is 
    now going under thanks to the mortgage scam that bankers got away 
    with. (The same thing happened in my area with the Wanaque Reservoir 
    in New Jersey. You could actually see the town during one of the 
    droughts). This is a story about how far people will go to keep their 
    memories alive, and none of it is pretty, even though Gosling uses 
    neon colors and daylight to express darkness. This is a must-see, but 
    it is not for everyone's tastes and it has a cast to die for; <B><A HREF="tapped_out_2013.htm">TAPPED
     OUT</A></B> (2013) is a pretty good revenge tale which involves MMA 
    cage fighting. Michael Shaw (Cody Hackman; <B><A HREF="hidden_in_the_woods_2013.htm">HIDDEN
     IN THE WOODS</A></B> - 2013; real-life 5-times World Karate 
    Champion) was a well-adjusted teen and karate prodigy who gave it all 
    up when he saw his parents carjacked and killed seven years earlier. 
    He became a troubled teenager and is now doing community service at a 
    rundown dojo owned by Reggie (Michael Biehn), cleaning floors and 
    toilets. Watching the children Reggie teaches gets Michael involved 
    in martial arts again (he even teaches the children), but it is a 
    chance meeting with Reggie's niece Jen (Jess Brown), who takes him to 
    an MMA cage fight, that gets him interested in working out to the 
    max. Inside the cage is the man who killed his parents, Dominic Gray 
    (Krzysztof Soszynski; real-life former TKO and ICC Heavyweight MMA 
    Champion) and Michael trains behind Reggie's back to get in shape to 
    get his revenge in the cage when the police refuse to help (Well, at 
    least most of them). Of course, Reggie isn't stupid and knows what 
    Michael is up to. To say anymore will be to deprive you of one of the 
    most unusual action films of the year. Look for Martin Kove in a cameo;<A NAME="SororPartyMass2013"></A> 
    I should really hate a film with the title <B><A HREF="sorority_party_massacre_2013.htm">SORORITY
     PARTY MASSACRE</A></B> (2013), but I'll be damned if I didn't enjoy 
    the hell out of this horror comedy, if only because character actor 
    Ed O'Ross (<B><A HREF="hidden_1987.htm">THE HIDDEN</A></B> - 1987) 
    gets a bigger role than normal. When Detective William Watts (Thomas

    [1996] with the Captain's daughter getting a phone call from the 
    killer and when she doesn't answer his questions correctly, she ends 
    up getting sprayed with acid by someone wearing a radiation suit 
    until there's nothing left of her except one of her feet!), but only 
    if the Captain will reduce his suspension from thirty to five days. 
    The Captain agrees, handing Detective Watts back his badge, but not 
    his gun, telling him he won't need it for this investigation, as he 
    is not to get personally involved and use more unnecessary excessive 
    force; this is for information purposes only. When Detective Watts 
    gets to the island, he must deal with dumb-as-dirt Sheriff Barney P. 
    Lumpkin (Ed O'Ross) and the strange Stella Fawnskin (Leslie 
    Easterbrook; <B><A HREF="devils_rejects_2005.htm">THE DEVIL'S REJECTS</A></B> 
    - 2005), who is running this sorority contest in her mansion, 
    instilling back-stabbing (literally!) and cruelty as a way of life in 
    all the girls. Rather than go into the plot, where the girls begin to 
    be murdered in ways related to their worst fears (Which Ms. Fawnskin 
    makes all the girls describe on their contest forms), I will tell you 
    this: No one is who they seem to be. No one. Further investigation by 
    Detective Watts reveals that young women have come up missing on this 
    island regularly since 1965, yet the outside world was never 
    cognizant of this fact; someone was covering it up. That's as far as 
    I'm going to go, except to say some of the murders are extremely 
    graphic and bloody and there's more than one killer on this island. 
    The six actresses who make up the sorority contestants do their jobs 
    extremely well, perhaps too well (Watch the film and you'll know what 
    I mean). They all look great in and out of their clothes. While I 
    generally frown on films with more than one director, it seems to 
    work here, as directors Chris W. Freeman (who also wrote the 
    screenplay) and Justin Jones do a great job keeping the film 
    fast-paced and funny, even sprinkling some cameos here and there, by 
    Louis Mandylor (<B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad_page2.htm#HotelDamned2016">HOTEL

    bee stings (her worst fear). While nothing extraordinary, this film 
    should satisfy your lust for pretty girls in various states of 
    undress, graphic murders and funny one-liners, as well as a 
    surprising reveal towards the end of the film that I never saw coming 
    (but I should have, as the pretty naked women made my mind wander!). 
    Shouldn't all horror comedies try to achieve that?;<A NAME="Good2014"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     I thought I would hate <B><A HREF="mercenaries_2014.htm">MERCENARIES</A></B> 
    (2014) since it comes from The Asylum, but this all-female 
    mini-version of <B><A HREF="expendables_2010.htm">THE EXPENDABLES</A></B> 
    (2010) and its sequels is just good old-fashioned action fun. 
    Besides, one of the stars is Zoe Bell and I'll watch anything she's 
    in. She started out being a stunt woman and does more than her share 
    here (no stand-ins) and she's a unique beauty who happens to appeal 
    to me (I love it when she says, &quot;We go PMS on this place!&quot;).
     The plot has bad woman Brigitte Nielsen kidnapping the President's 
    daughter in a fake Soviet bloc country, keeps her in a deserted 
    prison in that country and she's a man-hater (It doesn't help that 
    Nielsen still has that short near-white haircut, but she still looks 
    good for her age), so female agent for the CIA Cynthia Rothrock (who 
    still looks fantastic) puts together a 4-person woman mercenary 
    squad, all taken from prison, which includes Bell, Kristanna Loken, 
    Nicole Bilderback, and Vivica A. Fox, who use to be a CIA agent (and 
    (Rothrock's friend) until she turned traitor and promises them 
    pardons if they pull-off the mission. It's basically one shoot-out 
    after another (unfortunately, Rothrock doesn't go on the mission, but 
    she does get to knock-out Fox when she meets her in prison), with 
    explosions and car chases galore. There's also the expected 
    double-cross (I wonder who it could be? But Nielsen makes her 
    Minister of Tourism and she says, &quot;Maybe I'll get to fuck George 
    Clooney!&quot;) Unlike most films from The Asylum, there's very 
    little CGI involved (except for Nielsen's death at the end when she 
    falls out of a plane) and it was directed by Christopher Douglas-Olen 
    Ray, the son of Fred Olen Ray. Christopher (who played the small 
    monster in his father's <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Biohazard 1984">BIOHAZARD</A></B>

    (2014) is my pick as the best thriller of 2014 and for good reason. 
    It has great direction by Jim Mickle (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#MulberryStreet">MULBERRY
     STREET</A></B> - 2006; <B><A HREF="stake_land_2010.htm">STAKE LAND</A></B> 
    - 2010; <B><A HREF="we_are_what_we_are_2013.htm">WE ARE WHAT WE ARE</A></B> 
    - 2013), a twisty story based on a Joe R. Lansdale (who makes a cameo 
    here as a priest) novel of the same name (co-written by Mickle and 
    Nick Damici, who has <A HREF="cold_in_july_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cold in july poster6 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>written
     and appeared in all of Mickle's films, even starring in <B>STAKE LAND</B>)
     and the expert acting of a trio of stars who have never done better 
    work. It all begins when family man Richard Dane (Michael C. Hall; <B><A HREF="dexter_tv_series.htm">DEXTER</A></B> 
    - 2006-2013) shoots and kills a burglar who has invaded his home to 
    protect his wife (Vinessa Shaw) and young son (Brogan Hall; no 
    relation to Michael). The police identify the body of the burglar as 
    that of the son of ex-con Russel (Sam Shepard), who vows to take 
    revenge on Richard and his family. The police protect the Dane 
    family, but the young son was nearly kidnapped. When Richard sees 
    that the body of the man he shot bears no resemblance to Russel's son 
    and then watches as the police beat up Russel and tie him to the 
    train tracks to die, Richard swoops in in the nick of time to save 
    Russel and they both dig up the body of Russel's supposed son, only 
    to discover it is not him. Russel never tried to kidnap Richard's 
    child and they were all set up by the police for reasons better left 
    for you to discover. Russel calls in former Korean war vet friend Jim 
    Bob (Don Johnson, who has never been better) to find out what really 
    happened to his son since Russel hasn't seen or talked to him in 
    nearly 20 years. Jim Bob (who is as smart as they come, no matter the 
    name) discovers Russel's son is in the Witness Protection Program 
    after testifying against a drug organization he was a major part of, 
    but Joe Bob tracks him down. When it is discovered that Russel's son 
    is now involved in making snuff videos, where he tapes himself 
    killing women who are tied-up to a bed, Russel, Joe Bob and Richard 
    decide that Russel's son and his new snuff film organization has to 
    be destroyed, which leads to a very bloody end, not unlike that of my 
    favorite 70's thriller <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Rolling Thunder 77">ROLLING
     THUNDER</A></B> (1977). It is as bloody as anything ever produced in 
    2014. The reason the film works so well are the little subtleties 
    that are sprinkled throughout the film, from when Richard shackles 
    Russel up in a family cabin in the woods to feel him out after saving 
    him from being run over by a train (and finally realizing that Russel 
    is not a bad man), Joe Bob and Richard sitting outside while Russel 
    watches a tape of his son killing a woman on a snuff tape for the 
    very first time, to the final closing shot. This is a film you must 
    see if you want to watch one of the best unsung gems of 2014. Yes, it 
    is that good; <B><A HREF="atticus_institute_2014.htm">THE ATTICUS INSTITUTE</A></B> 
    (2014) is one weird film that tackles the religious phenomena called 
    demonic possession, but in a clinical, laboratory way. During 1976, 
    Dr. Henry West (William Mapother of <B><A HREF="lost_tv_series_2004-2010.htm">LOST</A></B> 
    - 2004-2010) has, what he believes is, an honest-to goodness woman, 
    Judith Winstead (Rya Kihlstedt), possessed by the Devil in his 
    laboratory, where he hopes to scientifically explain demonic 
    possession. The U.S. Government hears about it and takes over Dr. 
    West's lab, basically pushing him aside. They want to control Judith 
    and use her as a weaponized tool, in hopes of finding hidden nuclear 
    weapons around the world (you must remember, this was the 70's, when 
    we were still in a Cold War with Russia). Needless to say, things 
    don't go the way they hope and soon find out you can't control the 
    Devil (even when they bring an Exorcist in to tranfer the Devil from 
    the Judith's body to a soldier's). The Devil controls you. Part found 
    footage (the 70's parts) and part interview footage (with people 
    today who are still alive to talk about it, including actor John 
    Rubenstein), director/writer Chris Sparling (his solo film debut; he 
    also acts in it) finds a way to mix found footage and regular 
    filmmaking in a very interesting way on a subject usually confined to 
    homes and churches, but not laboratories. Give this one a try. It's 
    just unusual enough to hold your attention.;<A NAME="Scarehouse2014"></A> 
    I remember reading the synopsis of the horror film <B><A HREF="scarehouse_2014.htm">THE
     SCAREHOUSE</A></B> (2014) and it reads like every other haunted 
    house thriller, but this one is different. Very different. A group of 
    college women must stay in a warehouse decorated with scary props and 
    horror memorabilia (It was shot inside an actual working funhouse 
    called &quot;Scarehouse Windsor&quot; in Windsor, Ontario, Canada.).

    into the college's sorority a a member, by the sorority's two head 
    sorority sisters Corey Peters (Associate Producer and Story writer 
    Sarah Booth) and Elaina Forrester (Kimberly-Sue Murray), whom the 
    other women have never met. Right away we know there is something 
    wrong with these two women. The first girl to arrive at the 
    scarehouse is fitted with a corset in which is hooked up to a machine 
    to make it pull tighter and tighter until she begins bleeding from 
    between her legs and Corey stabs her over and over with a knife. It's 
    not too long before we find out that these two women served two years 
    in jail for spiking a guy's drink with a roofie, videotaping him 
    having a good time with his passed-out body (using camera phones to 
    take photos of him with a gross lipstick and made-up face because he 
    was apparently a rapist.). Unfortunately the guy died by choking on 
    his own puke and the girls were sent to prison. They know they were 
    set up by one of the girls who want to join the sorority, but they 
    don't know which one did it. This is their way of finding out. Along 
    the way, we will see such sights as a girl getting her breast 
    implants cut out (She always said they were natural) and then having 
    one of the implants shoved in her mouth; a pillow fight between two 
    other girls where one of the pillows is dusted with an acid based 
    powder (the results are icky to say the least) and discover one of 
    the girls, whose father is a preacher, was behind the setup because 
    the dead guy supposedly raped her. She has a TV thrown into a 
    water-filled bathtub she is in, electrocuting her. It turns out the 
    pastor paid all the girls $40,000 for the girls to keep their mouths 
    shut, so none of the girls are actually innocent. Once all the girls 
    are dispatched, Corey and Elaina, who have made a suicide pact, hang 
    themselves in front of a window that anyone could see through. One of 
    the girls has her noose tricked out, so she doesn't hang, puts a 
    buthcher knife in the other dying girl's hands and has her stab her 
    in the stomach. She runs away and screams for help, leaving the one 
    dead girl to take the rap. The main reason to watch this interesting 
    film is the performance by Sarah Booth as Corey. We really begin to 
    believe that she enjoys killing, because her time in jail made her a 
    murderer. It is a way above-average performance.

    directors, made their bones by directing short films, but he did

    those unclassifiable films that leaves you thinking long after the 
    film is over. Three teenage kids, all with physical or emotional 
    problems of their own, follow the signal of a hacker called NOMAD, 
    the very same hacker that almost got them expelled from school for 
    allegedly putting college exams on the school's server. They trace 
    the signal to an old abandoned house in Nevada and this is when the 
    story takes an unexpected turn. The three kids wake up to find their 
    bodies altered. Nic (Brenton Thwaites), who suffered from MD in his 
    legs, find his human legs replaced by artificial ones and he can run 
    very fast. Haley (Olivia Cooke), the one with the emotional troubles, 
    can simply think of something and it will happen. Jonah (Beau Knapp), 
    the most underwritten of all characters, has his right hand replaced 
    with a super-strong device. None of this new tech works in the 
    sterile building they are being held in and Nic is continually being 
    questioned by the hazmat suit-wearing Damon (Laurence Fishburne) 
    about how he found the signal. When the young adults escape and are 
    outside the building, they are able to use their new powers, like Nic 
    being able to outrun a speeding 18 wheeler, while Haley just appears 
    in the front seat holding a gun on the driver. But why does the road 
    end with a big crevasse between it and the other side? It seems the 
    only way out of this predicament is a bridge to the other side, but 
    Damon and his automatic rifle-carrying crew are closing in. Jonah 
    gives up his life to let his friends have more time to get to the 
    bridge, but none of it turns out the way you think it will. In the 
    end, Damon reveals himself to be some kind of robot with a human face 
    (a well-done creepy effect) and Nic (who outraces bullets while 
    running across the bridge after Haley has been killed in a truck 
    crash) discovers that he is on some kind of alien dome floating in 
    space. That is where the film ends and you will begin asking yourself 
    many questions. Are the aliens good or bad? Is this an experiment to

     any meaning (figure that one out for yourself)? Anyway, you will 
    come away with more questions than answers, but it is a good, well-directed
     (by William Eubank [<B><A HREF="love_2011.htm">LOVE</A></B> - 2011], 
    who also co-wrote the screenplay) and well-photographed mystery. Look 
    for Lin Shaye as a malfunctioning robot (Although you don't know it 
    at the time. You'll just think she is crazy.). Don't let the PG-13 
    rating fool you. This isn't about violence. This is about making a 
    film that needs to be discussed with your friends after it is over. 
    If you are looking for standard fare, pass this one by. If you are 
    looking for thought-provoking filmmaking, by all means enjoy this 
    one; I think I have found a worthy successor for Clint Eastwood in 
    the Western Movie Department: Mads Mikkelsen. Yes, that Mads 
    Mikkelsen of TV's sadly deceased <B><A HREF="hannibal_tv_series_2013.htm">HANNIBAL</A></B> 
    (2013 - 2015). If you have seen him in <B><A HREF="salvation_2014.htm">THE
     SALVATION</A></B> (2014), like I did four days in a row (Yes, it's 
    that good), I could just see him replacing Eastwood as The Man With 
    No Name. This unusual Western, a co-production between 
    Denmark/UK/South Africa/Sweden/Belgium, is a very violent take on 
    what it depletes out of the human soul to get revenge/retribution and 
    Mads Mikkelsen can say more with a simple look than most actors can 
    say with a page of dialogue. I also have never seen Jeffrey Dean 
    Morgan more evil than he is here (pay particular attention when the 
    preacher/sheriff [Douglas Henshall] must pick two people to be killed 
    and what Dean does when the choices aren't up to his standards). Eva 
    Green plays the mute wife of the brute Mikkelsen killed when the 
    brute killed his 8 year-old son and raped/murdered his wife and she 
    also says more with her eyes than any words can convey. I know I 
    don't usually recommend Westerns in this section, but see this one 
    when you can. Directed and co-written with expertise by Kristian 
    Levring (<B><A HREF="fear_me_not_2008.htm">FEAR ME NOT</A></B> - 
    2008). It's ultra-violent (especially the finale), plays like a 
    horror film (most Westerns do, but this one comes really close to 
    being a horror film unto itself) and has more human soul and and lack 
    thereof than 100 films. And I will repeat myself: Yes, it is that 
    good; A lot of people will compare <B><A HREF="anarchy_parlor_2014.htm">ANARCHY
     PARLOR</A></B> (2014) to <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hostel">HOSTEL</A></B> 
    (2005) and they may be right to a degree, but there is a lot more 
    going on here than torture of the human body (although there is also 
    plenty of that). Tattoo artist Robert LaSardo (his first film was 
    Abel Ferrara's <B><A HREF="china_girl_1987.htm">CHINA GIRL</A></B> 
    [1987]; who should be getting plenty of starring roles since he is so 
    good and he is heavily-inked in real-life), known simply as the 
    &quot;Artist&quot; and his quite mad heavily-inked assistant Uta 
    (Sara Fabel; Some people like women with a lot of tats, but I find it 
    unpleasant. Who wants to see them like this when they are 80 years 
    old? I know it is a double standard on my part, but that's just the 
    way I feel.) take two of six American college tourists to the 
    Artist's tattoo parlor in Vilnius, Lithuania (filmed on location). 
    Medical student Amy (Tiffany DeMarco) gets a simple tattoo that says 
    in Lithuanian &quot;Love Forever&quot; and is knocked out by a spiked 
    drink, while Brock (Ben Whalen) is knocked out with a hypo by Uta 
    downstairs. When Amy and Brock come to, we see the Artist cut off 
    Brock's tattoo with a scalpel, cut off his ear and feed it to his dog 
    and then carefully flay the skin off of Brock's back (nothing is left 
    to the imagination) to use as a &quot;canvas&quot;. He then cuts 
    Brock's femoral artery in his leg and he bleeds to death. He is using 
    Amy as his personal canvas, adding tattoos to her body, while her 
    friends look for her. They notice Brock's tattoo skin hanging in the 
    Artist's parlor, but one of the guys, Jesse (Jordan James Smith), 
    decides to stay behind, while the others get caught by the Artist and 
    Uta and are killed one-by-one (the Artist considers one of the girls 
    unsuitable for him, so he lets Uta use her for practice and she fails 
    at flaying the skin off her back, so she slits the girl's throat with 
    a scalpel). He keeps giving Amy tattoos and to say any more would to 
    be to ruin the ending. Sure, this is torture porn, but it is full of 
    nudity, actually has a plot and stars Robert LaSardo, who I am a big 
    fan of. There are a lot worse ways of spending 98 minutes, but be 
    prepared for no-holds-barred bloodletting and gore. 
    Directors/screenwriters Kenny Gage (writer/producer of <B><A HREF="raze_2013.htm">RAZE</A></B> 
    - 2013) &amp; Devon Downs (his first film) manage to hold our 
    attention and deliver a surprise or two along the way and make sure 
    you read the last line of the closing credits; <B><A HREF="let_us_prey_2014.htm">LET
     US PREY</A></B> (2014) is so thick with atmosphere, that you would 
    need a sharp knife to cut through it. This Ireland-made film (it's a 
    co-production between Ireland and Scotland, both countries that have 
    been releasing an awful lot of horror films lately thanks, in large, 
    to new tax credits laws), director Brian O'Malley's first 
    feature-length film, takes place at a terribly understaffed police 
    station on an island, when a total stranger with the name 
    &quot;Six&quot; (Liam Cunningham) walks in and seems to know 
    everything about both the policemen &amp; women and prisoners' lives, 
    from the time they were a child up to this day. PC. Rachel Heggie 
    (Pollyanna McIntosh), who had a traumatic event happen to her when 
    she was a young girl, jails Six for another crime (leaving the scene 
    of an automobile accident) and soon this mysterious man gets into 
    everyone's heads, causing them to commit murder, revealing murders 
    from their past and generally stirring up shit that everyone would 
    like to keep secret. Besides the opening when the credits play and we 
    see the tide go out while the mysterious Six is walking on the rocks 
    on the shoreline, nearly the entire film takes place in the police 
    station, where some surprising secrets are revealed and some 
    extremely gory killings happen. Though it's not really hard to 
    realize who Six is (just say of his name three times), the ending 
    will take you by surprise, as some people we thought we knew well 
    enough to trust, turn everything on its head. This is a movie you 
    have to watch and not skim through while you are doing something else 
    (Something I really never understood. Would you vacuum while reading 
    a book or washing dishes?). A really good movie that deserves your 
    attention; WARNING: For those who read Stephen King's novel &quot;<I>CELL</I>&quot;,
     I would advise you don't read the following review because you won't 
    like it.&nbsp; <B><A HREF="cell_2014.htm">CELL</A></B> (2014) is one 
    of the strangest &quot;zombie&quot; films that you may have ever 
    seen. Clay Riddell (John Cusack has taken a trip to the airport with 
    his young son Johnny (Ethan Andrew Casto) to pick up his daughter 
    Sharon (Clark Sarullo). Suddenly , everyones' cell phone starts to 
    ring, turning everyone who answers it at the airport into violent 
    beings. Only these people aren't fast-moving zombies, but people who 
    kill according to their occupation (a butcher does eat a person; a 
    cook stabs people with a knife and goes after Clay, who uses his 
    briefcase like a shield, with the big-ass knife going through it, A 
    police officer shoots people. etc) Clay throws his cell phone in the 
    garbage (smart move) and picks up new friends in the process: Tom 
    McCourt (Samuel L. Jackson), super-smart Charles Ardai (Stacy Keach) 
    and a few others. All of them have thrown their cell phones away (or 
    so Clay thought) and stolen an ice cream truck as they head down the 
    road trying to figure out what to do (Staying disconnected is staying 
    sane.). When night falls and in the film's most effective scene, 
    everyone hears electronic buzzing so Charles says all the 
    &quot;zombies&quot; are asleep. To prove his fact, he shoots a flare 
    gun into a field and hundreds of &quot;zombies&quot; come running 
    while on fire and their ice cream truck explodes, killing Charles. 
    These &quot;zombies&quot; aren't after the group as their main 
    mission, but are actually looking for a meeting place somewhere in 
    the forest and Clay's son goes missing. Clay goes out on his own to 
    find Johnny and must fight his way through hordes of 
    &quot;zombies&quot; who are not interested in Clay. Just what are 
    these mindless people hoping to find? We get a small clue when Clay 
    finds his son and they are walking down some railroad tracks talking, 
    when in reality. Clay is nothing but another mindless 
    &quot;zombie&quot; moving slowly through the crowd. What does this 
    mean? Do infected people all feel pleasure in their current 
    condition? Is the government somehow involved and if so, for what 
    reason? Is our atmosphere sick of all the cell towers proliferating 
    its landscape (in nearly every shot, we can see a cell tower)? There 
    are way too many unanswered questions, but that is what makes this 
    movie so good. You'll be trying to pick up clues along the way. This 
    is definitely a movie you need to see twice or more if you haven't 
    read King's coke-addled script. (he won't write unless he is 
    coked-up) He co-authored the screenplay with Adam Alleca&nbsp; (<B><A HREF="last_house_on_the_left_2009.htm">THE
     LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT</A></B> [2009] remake) and cut a few 
    important sections from the book. Director Tod Williams (<B><A HREF="paranormal_activity_franchise.htm">PARANORMAL
     ACTIVITY 2</A></B> - 2010) does a good job maintaining suspense 
    (even though blood and gore is kept to a minimum, there are still 
    short scenes of shocking violence throughout). If you want to enjoy 
    films the way I do, follow this simple rule: Never judge a movie by 
    the book it is based on. Or: Don't read the book until after you have 
    seen the movie.;<B> <A HREF="dont_blink_2014.htm">DON'T BLINK</A></B> 
    (2014; shot under the title <B><A HREF="dont_blink_2014.htm#LastStop">LAST
     STOP</A></B>) is one of those creepy horror films that relies on 
    atmosphere rather than blood and guts and, for the most part, works. 
    A group of young adults, including Mena Suvari, Brian Austin Green, 
    Joanne Kelly, Fiona Gubelmann, David de Lautour, Leif Gantvoort, 
    Emelie O'Hara, Samantha Jacobs and Zack Ward (also a Producer) make a 
    long drive to a mountain lodge in Colorado (actually filmed in New 
    Mexico) only to find it strangely deserted and there are also no 
    animals or even insects around (One of them fails to notice the words 
    &quot;Help Me&quot;, written in blood, on the inside of a cabinet 
    door). Suvari, who is about to tell Green that she is pregnant (he 
    already knows and is going to propose to her during their stay), 
    suspects something is very, very wrong (duh!) and since all their 
    cars are out of gas and they can't find the key to run the gas pumps 
    (and, of course, cell phones don't work there, the only cliche that 
    really bothered me about this film), are forced to spend the night. 
    That is when the strangeness really begins to happen. The group 
    suddenly disappear from sight one by one (in the blink of an eye, 
    thereby the title) and Ward just happens to bring a gun with him. It 
    proves quite useless in this situation, especially when one of the 
    disappeared comes back and Ward shoots him a couple of times in the 
    leg to get answers (he gets none and neither do we, so don't go 
    looking for an explanation about what is going on), so Ward shoots 
    himself in the head so he doesn't have to deal with the unknown (his 
    body disappears anyway). When only Kelly is left alive in the finale 
    and the police arrive (including a Man In Black, played by Robert 
    Picardo, who seems to know what is going on but fails to tell us), it 
    ends with everyone else disappearing and Kelly looking into the 
    rearview mirror of a police car, blinking and the screen goes black.

     Travis Oates does a good job maintaining the suspense with a minimal 
    of violence (the only blood is from the gunshots), yet with 
    atmosphere so thick you can cut it with a knife. This is a spooky 
    little film which will be talked about by more people in the future, 
    as they try to decipher what is really going on (I think the 
    appearance of a Man In Black speaks volumes); <B><A HREF="jessabelle_2014.htm">JESSABELLE</A></B> 
    (2014) was one of those PG-13 Rated supernatural films that got lost 
    in a year full of them (It was released shortly after <B><A HREF="annabelle_2014.htm">ANNABELLE</A></B>,
     which led to a lot of confusion with audiences and a big loss in 
    boxoffice receipts). Fortunately, this is one of the better ones, 
    with an above-average plot, some real scares and a denouement that 
    will send goosebumps all over your body. A girl named Jessabelle 
    (Sarah Snook, who is excellent), who likes to be called 
    &quot;Jessie&quot;, returns to her Louisiana house (actually filmed 
    in Wilmington, North Carolina) to recuperate from an automobile 
    accident that put her in a wheelchair. She discovers some VHS tapes 
    under her deceased mother's bed and they turn out to be a video diary 
    from her mother to her that were filmed back in 1988 when she was 
    still pregnant with Jessabelle. Each tape gets darker and darker in 
    tone (Mom says that there are two Jessabelles in the house) and once 
    her father (David Andrews) sees Jessie watching the tapes, he tries 
    to burn them, only to be burned to death himself in a shed. Jessie is 
    reunited with an old high school friend named Preston (Mark Webber) 
    and they become close, even though Preston is married (They don't 
    have sex, but they kiss). The mystery that follows, including a 
    hair-raising encounter in a bathtub and Preston being attacked by a 
    ghost girl (Amber Stevens) in his truck, along with the final VHS 
    tape (where Mom looks like she has aged 40 years in less than a 
    month), uncovers the truth about the two Jessabelles. I won't spoil 
    the mystery or the ending. Just enjoy the ride and expect to jump a 
    few times. Finally, a PG-13 Rated film that works.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    following around a clan of vampires (Jemaine Clement is the leader of 
    the cult and also co-director of the film with Taika Waititi, who is 
    also a star here.). We are treated to an exuberant &quot;night in the 
    life&quot; study of vampires, from their choices of bars, battling 
    vampire hunters (a very inventive scene that reminded me of <B><A HREF="2001_a_space_odyssey_1968.htm">2001:

    (There's a pee-your-pants funny scene about one of the vampires 
    talking to a 90 year-old Asian familiar on his computer) and their 
    continuing confrontations with a pack of werewolves. While the film

    (2014) has its problems, but in the end is a pretty engrossing 
    horror/gangster film. A religious killer known as The Reaper (Mike 
    Michaels), who performed a religious massacre and then survived the 
    electric chair and escaped the penintentiary, is tied to a story 
    about a con woman named Natalie (Shayla Beesley) who hitchhikes the 
    highways, goes to a hotel, this time the Last Chance Hotel (with a 
    church on the other side of the road) with a guy and then drugs him 
    and steals his cash (The first victim is Jake Busey, who is killed by 
    a motel clerk [Justin Henry] associated with the Reaper. He deserves 
    to be in the entire film.). The next victim is Brad (James Jurdi) who 
    is supposed to deliver a satchel of cash to boss Ron's (Vinnie Jones) 
    unknown friend, but she ends up ditching him on the side of the road 
    (after poking holes in his tires and using Busey's car as 
    transportation), only to have her stolen car break down. She is 
    picked up by the kindly Jack (Danny Trejo) and they head back in the 
    opposite direction (seems like Natalie is stealing the money for her 
    mother's operation in California) when Jack informs her they are 
    going in the wrong direction for California. They end up at the same 
    Last Chance Hotel as before (this time two rooms), where you will 
    have to discover what happens next. It just may surprise you. Besides 
    some minor gaffes, this is a very good cross-genre film that offers a 
    lot of surprises. Very good direction by Wen-Han Shih (who uses the 
    pseudonym &quot;Philip Shih&quot; here) and actor James Jurdi is one 
    of the screenwriters. I was expecting the worst and got a lot better 
    than I thought (Pay close attention on how electricity is used in 
    this film and the stinger during the closing credits); Don't call <B><A HREF="extinction_2014.htm">EXTICTION</A></B> 
    (2014) a zombie film because it's not. The film begins with a busload 
    of people in a convoy being attacked by creatures whose bites that 
    kill you turn you into one of them and best friends Jack (Jeffrey 
    Donovan; <B><A HREF="burn_notice_tv_series_2007-2013.htm">BURN NOTICE</A></B> 
    [2007 - 2013]) and Patrick (Matthew Fox; <B><A HREF="lost_tv_series_2004-2010.htm">LOST</A></B> 
    [2004-2010]) do their best to protect Patrick's pregnant wife. But 
    she ends up getting bitten and nine years pass, with Jack and Patrick 
    living in the cold, snowy ironic-sounding town named Harmony. They 
    live next to each other in fortified houses but haven't talked for 
    years for reasons better left to the viewer, Jack ends up taking care 
    of Patrick's daughter Lu (an excellent Quinn McColgan) as if she is 
    his own daughter. As a matter of fact, Lu thinks Jack is her father 
    (He's strict, but fair). For nine years their town has been 
    creature-free, but when Patrick takes a snow-mobile to the town for a 
    food run, he is attacked by a creature and makes a quick retreat with 
    his dog (who Lu spoils without Jack noticing). He overturns the snow 
    mobile when he hits a downed tree and Jack and Lu watch as Patrick is 
    bitten and the dog is killed by a creature (a very emotional scene if 
    you put yourself into Lu's shoes). Patrick learns that their bite no 
    longer has an effect on humans, as the creatures are evolving very 
    quickly (We are never told why these creatures exist, but my best 
    guess is that it was a government experiment gone wrong). Jack and 
    Patrick must once again work together and start to bond as friends 
    again, as the creatures begin to outnumber the humans (The whole town 
    of Harmony is empty except for the three people, until the final 15 
    minutes). Those looking for a gore-a-thon are bound to be 
    disappointed, because this film is more about human relations and 
    what it means to be a family. Both Donovan and Fox are great here 
    (especially the relationship between Donovan and Quinn McColgan; you 
    would never know that they weren't father and daughter) and the 
    ending will leave you thinking what <A HREF="john_doe_vigilante_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/john doe vigilante poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>you

    Miguel &Aacute;ngel Vivas (<B><A HREF="kidnapped_2010.htm">KIDNAPPED</A></B> 
    - 2010), based on co-screenwriter Juan de Dios Gardu&ntilde;onovel 
    &quot;Y pese a todo...&quot;, has made a human film about a time of 
    monsters. And a very good film at that. A Spain/USA/Hungary/France 
    co-production; What is it with Australia and thought-provoking genre 
    films? The one this time is director Kelly Dolen's (<B><A HREF="gates_of_hell_2008.htm">THE
     GATES OF HELL</A></B> - 2008) and screenwriter Stephen M. Coates' <B><A HREF="john_doe_vigilante_2014.htm">JOHN

    for an updating of <B><A HREF="death_wish_1974.htm">DEATH WISH</A></B> 
    (1974) are going to both be pleased and disappointed. This film asks 
    us all where the line is drawn between justice and vigilantism and 
    there is no easy answer. John Doe (an outstanding Jamie Bamber) is a 
    mask-wearing vigilante who has killed 32 people, every one of them 
    very bad people who have done unbelievable stomach-turning things and 
    either were not apprehended or were able to skip because of 
    technicalities in the law. He videotapes the killings and lets people 
    know that he alone is unable to do all the work, which results in a 
    group of masked vigilantes that help John Doe (at first it doesn't 
    work quite as planned). After killing the 32nd person (the one who 
    killed his daughter), John gives himself up and awaits his trial, 
    keeping quiet the whole time. Then one day he decides that he will 
    tell his story to reporter Ken Rutherford (Lachy Hulme) and we are 
    transported back to the beginning where, at first, the police didn't 
    care about John Doe because he was doing their job for them, but they 
    eventually had to form a special task force to catch him because he 
    was becoming much too popular (thanks to the videos of his killings 
    that he posted on a YouTube-like internet site). To tell you any more 
    will be to spoil the film, but there are two very unexpected 
    surprises at the finale (one that you will never see coming) and 
    there are some bloody killings, but they are done with baseball bats, 
    tire irons or guns, so they aren't ultra-gory (either was Charles 
    Bronson's film), but some do make you wince. Does the film give us an 
    answer about where the line is drawn? How could it, when we have no 
    answer? But this film will have you thinking about it long after the 
    film is over and isn't that what a good film is supposed to do? I 
    can't recommend this film enough. Even though it takes place in 
    Australia, it could take place in any country with a fair legal 
    system, including ours. Sometimes there is a big difference between 
    the law and justice; I generally dislike zombie comedies but <B><A HREF="i_survived_a_zombie_holocaust_2014.htm">I
     SURVIVED A ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST</A></B> (2014), a New Zealand horror 
    film, hits more of its targets than misses them. Even though the plot 
    has been done dozens of times (a movie crew filming a low-budget 
    zombie film actually are attacked by real zombies), this one is 
    different because it skewers all the cliches usually found in films 
    if this type, such as the leading muscular man actually being a 
    coward, the vain starlet getting by only because of the size of her 
    breasts, the director thinking he is making the best horror film of 
    all time (he isn't) and other stereotypes. Director/writer Guy Pigden 
    (his first film) focuses his film on new film runner Wesley 
    Pennington (Harley Neville), hired to be a gofer for the movie, who 
    begins to fall in love with the film's cook Susan Ford (Jocelyn 
    Christian), while dealing with an impossible director, his dedicated 
    assistant director and many other obstacles, including a village full 
    of real zombies who begin to make their way to the movie set in the 
    woods. Wesley is also a virgin and has written a screenplay about 
    zombies that is better than the movie being shot (the director, who 
    also wrote the screenplay of the movie being filmed, uses pages of 
    Wesley's screenplay to wipe his ass in an outhouse). As the real 
    zombies begin dispatching members of the crew (the director thinks 
    the real zombies are part of the crew), Wesley, Susan, Tane Henare 
    (Ben Baker) and muscular leading man Adam Harrison (Mike Edward), who 
    just screwed a female zombie thinking she was an extra on the shoot 
    (he pays for it in a disgusting way when he goes to take a pee), 
    begin to escape and make it to civilization. It's not the story that 
    is interesting (it is a little overlong at 104 minutes), but the 
    small things that hold your attention, such as actors trying to speak 
    U.S. English to make the film more sellable, the socks men wear 
    during nude scenes to cover their penises, the director chewing out 
    the leading lady by being blunt about why she is popular (she wants 
    someone to drive her to town to use a real bathroom because she 
    refuses to use the outhouse), and Tane telling his famous rugby story 
    and then reliving it in a wonderfully edited sequence during the end 
    of the film. While not perfect to some people (there are comparisons 
    to the <A HREF="bad_taste_1987.htm">early</A> <A HREF="braindead_1992c.htm">horror</A> <A HREF="dead_alive_1992.htm">films</A>

    that seem to piss off some reviewers, but it has more going for it 
    than that), it manages to hold your attention with some extreme gore 
    (body parts being chewed, a zombie cut in half grabbing Wesley, 
    plenty of bloody zombie deaths) mixed in with hearty laughs (Wesley 
    being forced to wear a cock sock while making love to Susan for 
    shooting the film's inserts and getting a boner; Wesley's dream 
    sequence; an electric mixer being used as a tool for a zombie's 
    death). The finale also breaks the fourth wall, which is also 
    unusual. What more could you ask for?; <B><A HREF="stage_fright_2014.htm">STAGE
     FRIGHT</A></B> (2014) is a strange and gory horror film because 
    everyone sings most of their dialogue! Ten years ago, Broadway diva 
    Kylie Swanson (Minnie Driver) is murdered on the opening day of her 
    new Broadway musical &quot;The Haunting <A HREF="stage_fright_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/stage fright 2014 poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Of
     The Opera&quot;. Kylie's children Camilla (Allie MacDonald) and 
    Buddy (Douglas Smith) were raised by Broadway Producer Roger McCall 
    (Meat Loaf Aday, who was also in the musical horror comedy cult film <B><A HREF="rocky_horror_picture_show_1975.htm">THE
     ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW</A></B> - 1975). Roger now runs a musical 
    theater Summer camp that is on the verge of bankruptcy. Roger decides 
    to make his camp profitable again by staging a kabuki version of The 
    Haunting Of The Opera and Camilla wins the lead role during 
    auditions, which makes Buddy really mad. While during rehearsals, a 
    maked killer (the mask is of the stage &quot;opera ghost&quot;, the 
    same mask the killer of Camilla &amp; Buddy's mother was wearing from 
    the play, which looks like a demon with a mouth like a 
    ventriloquist's dummy) who hates opera music and only sings in a 
    heavy metal tone. Roger is hoping the play is a success because 
    influential Broadway agent Victor Brady (James McGowan) will be at 
    the opening. The killer favors two circular saw blades as his weapons 
    of death and some of the deaths are downright gory, such as a stage 
    hand trying to avoid falling spotlight and one of them pinning his 
    foot to the floor. The killer tackles him , which results in the 
    separation of the foot from his body and then the circular saw blades 
    come into action. On opening day, all hell breaks loose, as the 
    killer stops Camilla from going on stage and we find out (via 
    flashbacks) that Roger killed Kylie and a young Buddy witnessed it. 
    It turns out the masked killer is actually Buddy, whose memory was 
    blocked of witnessing his mother's death until Roger decided to put 
    on the play his mother was supposed to star in. Roger is killed when 
    an electric circular saw cuts into his stomach and Camilla kills 
    Buddy, not realizing it was him who was wearing the mask. The film 
    ends on a note where everyone thinks what is going onstage is part of 
    the play (it isn't) and Victor Brady says he is going to make Camilla 
    a star. There's a <B><A HREF="carrie_1976.htm">CARRIE</A></B>-esque 
    ending to the film and director/screenwriter Jerome Sable (who also 
    wrote most of the lyrics and music) does a great job of holding your 
    attention with such an unusual plot, thanks to the plentiful blood 
    and gore and a killer that is not your usual generic masked killer.

     OF OUR YOUTH</A></B> (2014) is an uncompromising look at when a 
    potentially harmless prank turns deadly. During Christmas time, the 
    parents of teen Tyler (Lucas Till) are out of town leaving him and 
    his three friends Scott (Mitchel Musso), Carlo (Bridger Zadina) and 
    Tyler's brother David (Joel Courtney) to fool around with Tyler's 
    father's collection of automatic weapons. They decide to shoot up all 
    the Christmas deer decorations in the back yard, unaware that young 
    boy Bradley (Matt Hawk) has knocked on Tyler's front door and then 
    hears them talking in the back, He reaches the back yard just as the 
    foursome shoot-up the lighted deer to pieces&nbsp; and Scott 
    discovers the Bradley's body riddled with bullets, forcing him to 
    throw up. The foursome put the body of Bradley on the kitchen table 
    and try to decide what to do about it. Calling the police is out of 
    the question because they were using illegal automatic weapons (Which 
    are manufactured for one reason only: to kill people, which these 
    weapons happened to do.). The foursome can't really come up with any 
    plan that will not throw their ass in jail, so they bury Bradley. 
    They decide that in order to allieviate their guilt, they will hunt 
    each other down and the only one left will be free an clear. They all 
    make a tape together professing their guilt, so no one will chicken 
    out and not play the &quot;game&quot;. How it turns out is probably 
    how it would play out in real life. Kids today don't think before 
    they act and the can get into some serious, deadly trouble. Director 
    Gary Entin, who acted in such films as <B><A HREF="rest_stop_dead_ahead_2006.htm">REST

    appeared in all the films Gary did, even playing twins in the two <B>REST
     STOP</B> films and <B>SECONDS APART</B>) to it's best advantage, 
    making the teens seem real and even portraying Scott's mother, Vicki 
    (Ally Sheedy) as the type of mother (a cougar) that lets her underage 
    son drink alcohol in front of him while hitting on David and other 
    male kids. The use of Christmas standards on the soundtrack greatly 
    enhances the atmosphere of the film. This is a great films about 
    teens, the mistakes they make and the way they try to rectify it. 
    None of it turns out the way you think it will. This is one of the

    Elliot gets a call on his cell phone. The voice on the other end 
    tells him that if he completes 13 challenges, he will be richer than 
    his wildest dreams, but there is a catch. Each challenge he completes 
    comes with a cash prize but if he doesn't complete a challenge, all 
    the money he has acquired will be defaulted. The first couple of 
    challenges are easy (Kill a fly and steal a manger scene from a 
    church and burn it [he nearly burns down the whole church!]), but 
    each challenge gets harder and more deadly (cut off the arm of a 
    school bully and behead a biker gang!). Elliot is also being sought 
    by Detective Chilcoat (Ron Perlman), who is always a step behind, but 
    finds an important clue in what is going on by talking to Vogler 
    (Pruitt Taylor Vince), who may be a &quot;winner&quot; of the game. 
    The caller knows all of Elliot's moves, so he cannot fake anything. 
    Will he get through this game intact? I'll never tell, but this is a 
    good little mystery with some extreme dollups of blood and gore.

    after this film was finished). Just how long has this game been in 
    existence and how far-reaching is it? Elliot finds out in the

     humans. The Norman Brothers take everyone on the stagecoach prisoner 
    (at least those they let live, in a scene with one of the best jump 
    scares I have ever experienced. I swear my heart stopped for a 
    moment, so I had to rewind it to experience it again! It comes just 
    as the preacher, Father Dominic [Kerry Shale], another passenger on 
    the stagecoach, is about to perform a funeral for the only living man 
    in the deserted town, who they find torn apart with his liver eaten), 
    but when they hear howling outside, everyone knows that something 
    deadly is waiting for them if they leave the saloon. It is a sole 
    skinwalker, who begins killing the cast in various very gory ways (we 
    see the skinwalker pulling away the lower half of Henry's body, while 
    Jake holds his hand, the upper part of his body staying put!). 
    Meanwhile, Wade (Jack Fox), the sheriff of the town that had the bank 
    robbery, along with female Indian tracker Black Deer (Eleanor 
    Matsuura), begin tracking the Norman Brothers, but Wade is in for a 
    surprise of his own, as Black Deer is much more than the drunken 
    Indian she lets on to be. This is a marvelously acted film, with many 
    surprising deaths and frightening scenes, nearly all of them work. 
    Calhoun is also part of the mystery, as whenever anyone asks him 
    where he is from, he says, &quot;I could tell you, but you'll say you 
    never heard of it.&quot; He knows more about skinwalkers than he lets 
    on, but his mysterious past remains hidden (except for a small bit of 
    dialogue spoken by Hank). Director Jeremy Wooding (<B><A HREF="magnificent_eleven_2013.htm">THE
     MAGNIFICENT ELEVEN</A></B> - 2013) fills the film with a distinct 
    Gothic horror atmosphere, where shadows contain frightening things 
    and many people are not who they pretend to be (especially Jake's 
    wife Sarah). I could have watched Shaun Dooley's character for the 
    entire film, but the fact is everyone turns in a good performance, 
    especially Corey Johnson as Hank, who can't stop spitting on the 
    floor (a running joke throughout the film). There's not a wasted 
    moment in this film. It contains plenty of unrated gore, a 
    fast-moving story, great acting and wonderful special effects, 
    especially the wolf-like creature, played by Ian Whyte. This film 
    ends, like most modern horror films, with a bit during the end 
    credits that promises a sequel, but, unlike most modern horror films, 
    this is a sequel you will want to see. If you want to see a modern 
    horror film done right, buy or rent the Uncork'd Entertainment DVD or

    Some friends told me to see <B><A HREF="hive_2014.htm">THE HIVE</A></B> 
    (2014), because it was &quot;right up my alley&quot; and boy were 
    they right! This is a fantastic horror film with great acting from a 
    young cast and really good direction by David Yarovesky, his first 
    full-length feature. It starts out with teenager Adam (a wonderful 
    Gabriel Basso) waking up in a room, where the doors and windows are 
    boarded up from the inside. He has no recollection why he is there, 
    but there are sentences written in white chalk on the walls, one of 
    them being the word &quot;Remember&quot;. He then starts to have 
    quick memories of the recent past, where he and best friend Clark 
    (Jacob Zachar) are counselors at a summer camp for young children. 
    Adam is kind of a horndog, screwing Clark's girl Jess (Gabrielle 
    Walsh) at his favorite spot by the lake at night and not telling 
    Clark what he did. He accidentally knocks out female camp counselor 
    Katie (a great Kathryn<A HREF="hive_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hive 2014 poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    Prescott) and a romance brews. Katie is unlike any girl he has ever 
    met before and when he takes her to his favorite spot by the lake, 
    she tells him not to say that he loves her like all the other girls 
    he has taken here, because she knows all about him. She tells him 
    that he will only know love when he needs it the most (She still 
    screws him anyway!). While they are doing the dirty deed, they see a 
    plane crash into the nearby forest, so Adam and Katie, along with 
    Clark and Jess, drive to the crash site and meet the pilot, who looks 
    funny and is covered with a black oily liquid. He tries to attack the 
    foursome, so they get in their vehicle and drive away, only Clark 
    crashes, sending Jess out the front window (a really tense scene, 
    filmed very well). When Adam wakes up, Clark is in the front seat 
    telling him not to make any noise, the pilot is outside and he puked 
    the black liquid into Jess' face. Long story short, the pilot was 
    infected with a Soviet-created virus which the people who are 
    infected have a &quot;hive mentality&quot;. Instead of saying 
    &quot;I&quot;, they say &quot;We&quot; and instead of saying 
    &quot;Me&quot; they say &quot;Us&quot;. They are all connected in 
    some way and share the same group brain. Adam is also infected with 
    this virus, but he is now in a &quot;pocket&quot; state, where he is 
    using his own brain and not the group one. The only problem with 
    being in the pocket state is a total lack of memory, which is why he 
    began writing things in chalk on the wall. Every sentence brings back 
    a certain memory and it may lead to the virus being wiped out. This 
    is a tense, fascinating film, the likes of which I have never 
    experienced before. It also has a very nihilistic finale. Yes, Adam 
    now knows what love is, but is it too late? This new hive mentality 
    doesn't seem to have human emotions and are only interested in 
    infecting the rest of the world (by puking in their mouths!). I sat 
    rapt watching this film, because it is not just a great horror film, 
    it is also a very intense personal drama, where Adam tries to cure 
    Katie of her infection. The reaction Clark has, when an infected Jess 
    tells him that Adam fucked her (she talks about herself in the third 
    person), is worth the price of admission alone. You'll be cheering 
    for Adam, because his love for Katie is right there on the screen and 
    it is believable. Also appearing in this film is Sean Gunn and Elya 
    Baskin as the new government scientist trying to perfect the virus 
    and the Soviet scientist trying to stop him. The effects in this film 
    are marvelous (most of them are practical), but it is the acting here 
    that will hold your attention. I can't wait to see what director 
    David Yarovesky does next (this review was written in the beginning 
    of 2019 and he still has yet to make another feature). James Gunn 
    (Sean's brother), who got a lot of press recently because of his past 
    tweets and was fired by Disney, is thanked in the end credits. This 
    film definitely has his brand of humor in it. This is a horror film 
    worth your attention. It is available streaming on Amazon Prime, free 
    to Prime members. Movies like this are what makes Prime worth the

     Albert Brooks), who lost four of the fingers on his right hand in an 
    editing accident (he was editing the world's longest film and lack of 
    sleep led to him accidently cutting off his fingers when splicing 
    film!), spent some time in a loony bin and is now reduced to editing 
    schlocky B-Films, his right hand now having four wooden fingers; his 
    missing digits are enough for everyone to call him 
    &quot;Cripple&quot;! Someone dressed in black (complete with black 
    stocking over their face) is killing the leading actors of a film he 
    is editing, cutting off the fingers of their right hands, so, of 
    course, police Detective Peter Porfiry (co-director/co-screenwriter 
    Matthew Kennedy), has Rey Ciso as his number one suspect. It doesn't 
    help that Ciso's wife, former actress Josephine Jardin (a wonderful 
    Paz de la Huerta; <B><A HREF="nurse_3d_2012.htm">NURSE 3D</A></B> - 
    2012), is making Rey's life miserable, pining for the new leading 
    actor, Cal Konitz (co-screenwriter Conor Sweeney), who may have been 
    her former lover before marrying Rey. More and more people end up 
    dead, sliced to death with a straight razor (a giallo trope), until 
    the killer is revealed. The film is a fantastic mix of graphic nudity 
    and graphic gore, something we could usually depend on when watching 
    giallo flicks, and the two directors play everything basically 
    straight (but not always) and give the genre a loving send-up (there 
    are even <A HREF="editor_2014.htm#FakePosters">fake posters</A> of 
    giallo films on Rey's editing bay walls, drawn by Graham Humphreys) . 
    Everyone speaks with an Italian accent (Adam Brooks is even made to 
    look and talk like Franco Nero!) and say ridiculous things with a 
    straight face, nearly everyone chain-smokes, there is some obvious 
    intentional over-dubbing and it is filmed with bright neon color 
    lighting (cinematography also by Brooks), giving us the feel of a 
    Dario Argento film (he is name-dropped in the film, as well as a 
    &quot;Three Mothers&quot; book playing an important clue in the 
    plot). I thought the short film <B><A HREF="italian_spiderman_2007.htm">ITALIAN
     SPIDERMAN</A></B> (2007) was the ultimate send-up of Italian genre 
    films, but this film has replaced it as my favorite (the scene where 
    Rey sees a black dot flashing on the upper right of the screen really 
    made me laugh hysterically!). Not only do most of the Astron-6 crew 
    appear in the film, they are capably helped along by personal 
    favorite Udo Kier (<B><A HREF="andy_warhols_frankenstein_1973.htm">ANDY
     WARHOL'S FRANKENSTEIN</A></B> &amp; <B><A HREF="andy_warhols_dracula_1973.htm">DRACULA</A></B>

    - 1977), who appears as an insane asylum doctor and Jerry Wasserman (<B><A HREF="black_christmas_2006.htm">BLACK
     CHRISTMAS</A></B> - 2006) as the Chief of Police, whose daughter is 
    married to Detective Porfiry (How she dies and what happens next is a 
    total hoot!). And Claudio Simonetti (a member of &quot;Goblin&quot;; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DeepRed1975">DEEP
     RED</A></B> - 1975) supplied some of the memorable music! I could go 
    on praising this film (the scene where Detective Porfiry walks up to 
    Josephine in a restaurant and slaps her hard across the face, telling 
    Rey to keep his woman in line, is pure comic genius!), but I think it 
    is better if you experience it for yourself. If you are a fan of 
    giallo films or Fulci (and who isn't?), this is a film you should see 
    ASAP! Or as Udo Kier says in the film: &quot;Weird. Really weird.&quot;;<A NAME="DollFactory2014"></A>&nbsp;
     Killer doll movies have become all the rage in recent years, thanks 
    in no part to the success of <B><A HREF="annabelle_2014.htm">ANNABELLE</A></B> 
    (2014) and <A HREF="annabelle_creation_2017.htm">its</A> <A HREF="annabelle_comes_home_2019.htm">sequels</A>,
     but I doubt you will find a cheaper, gorier and downright funnier 
    film than <B><A HREF="doll_factory_2014.htm">DOLL FACTORY</A></B> 
    (2014). While the plot of the film is generic stuff, it's the 
    performances and the cheapjack effects that will have you rolling on 
    the floor with laughter and, sometimes, disgust (but in a good way). 
    In the late-1970's something supernatural and deadly happened in a 
    doll factory, but it was defeated and the factory has sat abandoned 
    ever since that day and rumors of strange happenings are<A HREF="doll_factory_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/doll factory amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    still being reported and told by the townspeople up till this day. In 
    the present, a group of teenagers start to party in the doll factory, 
    when one of the girls decides to throw a seance and read from a 
    strange book of spells she found in the factory. As you can probably 
    guess, it releases the curse that happened in the '70s, causing all 
    the miniature dolls to come to life and slaughter all the teens 
    except for wiseass Mark (Justin Herman, who gets off some very funny 
    one-liners in the film) and his former girlfriend Kay (Nicole 
    Elliott). The duo report the deaths to the Sheriff, Bart Barclay 
    (Chris Fender; I still haven't decided if his bad acting was natural 
    or a put-on), who was at the doll factory in the '70s when the 
    trouble was defeated. He refuses to help the kids, but he and his 
    deputy, Donnie Harris (Larry Wade Carrell; the director/star of <B><A HREF="jacob_2011.htm">JACOB</A></B> 
    - 2011; and the best actor in the film), stake out the doll factory 
    and make it off limits to everyone. Mark and Kay enlist Kay's nerdy 
    brother, Melvin (Andy Palmer) to help them reverse the curse to send 
    all the dolls back to Hell where they came from. Meanwhile, the small 
    dolls come to town to kill people and collect their souls so they can 
    bring demon Yegor (Patrick Sane) to our realm so he can make the 
    world a Hell on Earth. Melvin, using his computer, discovers that a 
    man named Darius Grumley (Boo Gay, doing his best Redd Fox imitation 
    and nailing it) was actually the one who defeated the dolls in the 
    70's, but he's older now (but not much wiser) and still lives in town 
    (but on the bad side). Our heroic trio go to Darius's home to try and 
    convince him to help them, but it's a hard sell. He eventually agrees 
    to help them, but he says he must have the book of spells to defeat 
    the dolls. Guess where the book is? That right, it's in the doll 
    factory, which is closely guarded by the Sheriff and his deputy. Can 
    the trio and Darius get inside the doll factory, find the book and 
    defeat the dolls before they have enough souls to raise Yegor? You 
    are going to have to watch the film to find out, but this is a funny, 
    enjoyable ride that you will either like or hate. I happened to like 
    it a lot, if only for the snappy dialogue and the way the small dolls 
    move and speak. The effects are definitely low-rent, but they work 
    here. I especially loved the way the small dolls figure out a way to 
    drive a car so they could get to the town quicker. Director/writer 
    Stephen Wolfe, in his second full-length feature film, has his tongue 
    firmly pressed against his cheek, making a film that I found 
    extremely funny and gory. People have their heads ripped off, their 
    legs ripped off and other gory damage, all done by the little dolls. 
    I wasn't expecting to like this, but found myself having a good time 
    with it, even laughing out loud a few times. If you are willing to 
    overlook the extremely small budget and accept the film on its own 
    terms, you will probably enjoy yourself, too. Truth be told, I didn't 
    want it to end. That's a rare thing to happen to me.;<A NAME="TakingDebLogan2014"></A> 
    Everyone who reads this site knows my distaste for &quot;Found 
    Footage&quot; horror films, as most of them are cheap, unoriginal, 
    dizzying, nauseous and, most of all, downright boring. They also lack 
    any common sense at all, especially when it comes to the actions of 
    the person holding the video camera. I mean, would you hold on to a 
    video camera when you are being chased and film your own death? 
    Imagine my surprise when I found a film in this genre that actually 
    works on every level. That film would be <B><A HREF="taking_of_deborah_logan_2014.htm">THE
     TAKING OF DEBORAH LOGAN</A></B> (2014). This film has everything a 
    horror film lover could ask for: Great acting, a twisty plot, scares 
    aplenty and a finale that will chill you to the bone (So much so that 
    some dishonest YouTubers tried to pass off the footage for a 
    real-life cave haunting in one of those many &quot;genuine&quot; 
    paranormal video that permeate YouTube!). This film details a 
    documentary video crew filming the life of Deborah Logan (Jill 
    Larson; who is not only excellent, but downright scary!) who is in 
    the early stages of Alzheimers Disease. Deborah's daughter Sarah (an 
    equally excellent Anne Ramsay; <B><A HREF="planet_of_the_apes_2001.htm">PLANET
     OF THE APES</A></B> - 2001) volunteered her mother to be the subject 
    of this documentary, because they are broke and need the money for 
    her treatment, but also she's a perfect subject for the documentary, 
    which details the life of an Alzheimers patient and the impact it has 
    on those who care for them. Mia Medina (Michelle Ang) is the head of 
    the documentary crew, along with videophile Gavin (Brett Gentile), 
    who studies the footage shot every day very carefully, and cameraman 
    Luis (Jeremy DeCarlos). It's obvious that Deborah doesn't want any 
    part of this documentary, but Sarah always manages to talk her into 
    going along with it. It's also quite obvious that Deborah is 
    suffering from something more than Alzheimers, as the cameras placed 
    throughout her house show her disappearing and then appearing 
    somewhere else, as if in a blink of the eye. There is also neighbor 
    Mr. Harris (Ryan Cutrona), who has been friends with Deborah since 
    she was the town's <A HREF="taking_of_deborah_logan_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/taking of deborah logan poster6a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>telephone
     operator over 40 years ago and wants the documentary crew to go 
    away, as if he is hiding something. Deborah ran the service from the 
    house she still lives in and all the machinery needed is still in the 
    attic, yet inoperable. It first starts out with Deborah walking in 
    her sleep and staring out a particular window. She then nails the 
    window shut, as if she was trying to stop someone from coming in, not 
    getting out (Yet, the window is always found open, the nails 
    protruding from the bottom, as if some supernatural force pulled it 
    open). During one of her sleepwalking outings, she rips her own 
    throat open with her bare hands (quite graphic) and is rushed to the 
    hospital. After a complete examination, Deborah has broken out in an 
    ugly rash on her back that cannot be explained. The doctor tells 
    Sarah that her mother is no longer in the early stages of Alzheimers, 
    but in one of its later, more deadly stages. It seems to have jumped 
    to a later stage in a matter of days. A bunch of unexplainable 
    strangeness begins to happen in the house, such as Deborah walking 
    around the house naked and then manning the telephone operator 
    machine, which hasn't worked in years, but seems to be working now. 
    When Deborah throws up a tremendous amount of dirt (!), it leads 
    Sarah and Mia to discover a story about a serial killer in town that 
    ritualistically killed four young girls during the early-1980s, but 
    then just disappeared. The killer was the town dentist who was known 
    to perform satanic rituals in order to gain immortality. His plan was 
    to murder five young girls to gain that immortality, but he 
    disappeared one girl short. Further research reveals that the dentist 
    was one of Deborah's clients when she was a telephone operator. It 
    turns out that the serial killer planned on killing Sarah as his 
    fifth victim, but when Deborah and Mr. Harris found out, they killed 
    him and buried him somewhere on the property, a secret that they have 
    been keeping for forty years. Not only is Deborah suffering from 
    Alzheimers, she is also possessed by the spirit of the serial killer, 
    who plans on murdering one more young girl to get his immortality in 
    the afterlife (Does he really need that?). When Deborah is once again 
    admitted to the hospital, the serial killer inside her kidnaps a 
    young girl who is going through cancer chemotherapy and plans on 
    killing her. Sarah, Mia and Luis try to catch Deborah as she escapes 
    from the hospital with the young girl. It leads them to a cave, where 
    you will witness one of the strangest sights in horror film history, 
    where a possessed <A HREF="taking_of_deborah_logan_2014.htm#HeadEatingPhoto">Deborah
     has the young girl's head in her mouth</A> (!), as if she is going 
    to swallow her whole, like some big snake! I must admit that I had to 
    rewind the film several time to see this sequence and every time it 
    sent shivers down my spine. It's quite unlike anything I ever saw 
    before and that's just a small part of why I like this film so much. 
    For one thing, everyone acts like normal people and do things that I 
    would think I would do if put in the same situation. One example 
    comes when Mr. Harris fires his shotgun into the cars of the 
    documentary crew. When he is arrested, Gavin leaves the crew and 
    doesn't come back, saying he's had enough. It's nice to see an 
    intelligent person in a horror film. The biggest reason why I like 
    this film is the way the plot slowly fits together, making sense of 
    everything that went on before it was revealed. There also hardly any 
    &quot;shakey-cam&quot; in this film, another blessing for someone who 
    doesn't like to get dizzy and nauseous watching a Found Footage film. 
    And there's only one small scene of &quot;night vision&quot;, you 
    know what I mean, that sickly green footage that takes place in total 
    darkness in which many Found Footage films revel in. Here it lasts 
    less than 30 seconds. Director/co-screenwriter Adam Robitel (<B><A HREF="insidious_the_last_key_2017.htm">INSIDIOUS:
     THE LAST KEY</A></B> - 2017) keeps the film moving at a very quick 
    pace and offers so many genuine scares, horror fans are bound to 
    stand up and take notice. Frankly, it's one of the scariest films I 
    have seen in a long, long time (One reviewer says: &quot;If you 
    suffer from constipation, watching this film will make you shit your 
    pants!&quot; I agree.). I recommend that you watch this film as soon 
    as possible (At the time of this review, it is available streaming on 
    Tubi. There are commercials, but they are short, less than 60 seconds 
    every 20 minutes or so.). Bryan Singer, the Producer of this film, 
    was accused of sexual misconduct by several underage men and has 
    disappeared from the film scene. It's best if I say no more.;<A NAME="Charlie'sFarm2014"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Every veteran reader of this site knows how much I love Australian 
    horror films. There's just something about the location that feels 
    alien to me. Every veteran reader also knows that I consider Tara 
    Reid one of the worst actresses in the entire world, so what happens 
    when she appears in an Australian horror film? Thankfully, in <B><A HREF="charlies_farm_2014.htm">CHARLIE'S
     FARM</A></B> (2014), Reid does a minimum of emoting and lets the 
    film wallow in '80s-like gory goodness. You just gotta love when a 
    film&nbsp; opens with a decapitation and a disembowelment before the 
    opening credits play. We then see Natasha (Reid; <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad_page2.htm#BusPartyToHell2018">BUS
     PARTY TO HELL</A></B> - 2018) in a bikini, showing us her best 
    assets (it isn't her acting!), as she floats in a pool while her 
    friends Jason (Dean Kirkright) and Mick (Sam Coward), a.k.a. 
    &quot;Donkey&quot; (called that because he has a large penis that he 
    can kiss!), discuss going to<A HREF="charlies_farm_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/charlie's farm amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    Charlie's Farm, a place sitting in the middle of a thousand acres 
    where, back in the '80s, it was the site of a series of unsolved 
    murders of the family that lived there, who were said to be 
    cannibals. Jason and Donkey don't want to tell that to Natasha or 
    Melanie (Allira Jaques), who want to go camping with them, so they 
    tell them that they are all going horseback riding and fishing out 
    west and will tell them the truth once they get there. On the long 
    drive there, they stop at a bar, where Donkey asks patrons if they 
    know the way to Charlie's Farm. They all look at him like he is crazy 
    and don't say a word. An old man named Blue (Bob Mussett) tells 
    Donkey it's best if he and his friends turn around and go home. 
    Blue's unnamed friend tells the group as they are leaving that Blue 
    was at Charlie's Farm during the '80s when the murders happened and 
    it's no place for the likes of them (Donkey starts pushing him 
    around, so for spite, he tells Donkey the directions to the farm, 
    knowing that they will be walking into a massacre). The girls make 
    Donkey fess up and he tells them all about Charlie's Farm. Cue the 
    Flashback: We see John Wilson (an extended cameo by Bill Moseley; <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad_page2.htm#ThreeFromHell2019">3
     FROM HELL</A></B> - 2019), the father of young, retarded Charlie 
    Wilson (Cameron Caulfield), talking to a girl he has tied to a bed, 
    telling her he just murdered her boyfriend and his wife Merideth 
    (Trudi Ross), is cooking his flesh for supper. Young Charlie sits in 
    the room, listening to the entire conversation (It is also implied 
    that John abuses him both mentally and physically). A group of 
    townspeople confront John and Merideth at the front of their house, 
    telling them to turn themselves into the police, accusing them of 
    cannibalism. Merideth gets angry and tells all of them that they are 
    fucked, which results in one man blowing John's head off with a 
    shotgun (quick, but very gory). Back in the present, Natasha phones 
    her friend Tony Stewart (Kane Hodder; <A HREF="hatchet_franchise_2007-2017.htm">The
     </A><B><A HREF="hatchet_franchise_2007-2017.htm">HATCHET</A></B><A HREF="hatchet_franchise_2007-2017.htm"> Franchise</A> 
    [2007 - 2017]), who tells Jason not to go to Charlie's Farm, because 
    many backpackers and campers go missing there and are never found. 
    Jason tells him that they will be camping there for one or two days, 
    so Tony tells him to phone him when they leave so he knows everyone 
    is okay. How much you wanna bet that is one phone call that is never 
    made? The foursome arrive on the outskirts of Charlie's Farm, but 
    there's a padlocked gate that prevents them from driving any further, 
    so they decide to hike to the farm. After hiking all day, they come 
    upon the Wilson farmhouse, which is nothing but a rotting structure 
    covered in dirt and dust. Inside, Donkey finds a locked door, which 
    he breaks down. Inside the room is a badly worn teddy bear, which 
    Melanie stuffs in her purse as a souvenir. When Donkey mentions that 
    items in the farmhouse could be considered collector's items and 
    worth a lot of money, Natasha makes everyone promise that Melanie can 
    keep the teddy bear, but everything else stays where it is. Jason 
    then begins to tell everyone what actually happened in the farmhouse 
    on that fatal day back in the '80s. Cue The Next Flashback: The 
    townspeople break into the farmhouse&nbsp; and find everyone dead 
    except for Merideth and Charlie. The woman John tied to the bed is 
    still there, her flesh decaying&nbsp; and her stomach cut open. 
    Merideth confronts the townspeople, who want to know where the 
    &quot;retard&quot; is. Merideth tells them Charlie died twelve months 
    ago, but he's actually hiding in the shadows, watching the 
    townspeople murder his mother. Back in the present, Natasha compares 
    the farm to the ranch Charles Manson lived in before the 
    Tate&#150;LaBianca Murders and Donkey make a bad taste Manson joke (<B>Donkey:</B> 
    Charles Manson is walking through the forest with this guy. And this 
    guy turns to him and says, &quot;Dude, this is one scary forest.&quot;
     Charles turns to him and says, &quot;Shutup, man! I'm the one who's 
    gotta walk outta here on my own!&quot;). Jason wants to explore the 
    farm at night, but even Donkey believes that is a bad idea, so they 
    all go to sleep together in the same room (Natasha insists on it). 
    They all wake up at 12:15 the next afternoon and are greeted by two 
    backpackers, Alyssa (Genna Chanelle Hayes) and Gordon (David 
    Beamish), who say they heard about this place from four other 
    backpackers and were hoping to meet them here. Melanie then notices 
    that the teddy bear is missing from her purse, but no one admits to 
    taking it. Jason and Natasha go exploring with Alyssa and Gordon, 
    while Melanie and Donkey go exploring together, find a strange hole 
    in the ground and then go swimming in their knickers in a lake 
    (Donkey, who is kind of hefty, wears a pair of bikini briefs, leaving 
    little to the imagination and earning his &quot;Donkey&quot; 
    nickname!). Alyssa and Gordon split from Jason and Natasha and find a 
    barn, go inside and are savagely slaughtered by a fully grown Charlie 
    (ex-WWE wrestler Nathan Jones; <B><A HREF="condemned_2007.htm">THE CONDEMNED</A></B> 
    - 2007), who looks like a huge mutant hillbilly (his frame is quite 
    impressive). Gordon is disemboweled by Charlie's huge machete-like 
    blade and Alyssa has her head squashed like a grape by a huge tire on 
    a tractor. Later on, Jason and Natasha discover the barn, but Natasha 
    refuses to go inside, so Jason does by himself. Meanwhile, Tony 
    Stewart is worried that Jason hasn't called him yet and he's not 
    answering his phone, so he tells his wife he is going to drive there 
    to check up on the group. Donkey and Melanie are making out in the 
    lake when she notices Charlie looking at them. A naked Donkey 
    approaches Charlie, only for Charlie to cut off Donkey's huge penis 
    and shove it in his mouth (very little is left to the imagination). 
    Melanie tries running away, but Charlie catches her, lifts her up in 
    the air and throws her to the ground. He then sticks his hand in 
    Melanie's mouth and rips her lower jaw off (A really gory, disgusting 
    sight. In other words, I loved it!). As it begins to get dark, 
    Natasha tells Jason to get out of the barn, but he doesn't answer. 
    Tony arrives at the farmhouse, but no one is there (How did Tony get 
    his car past the padlocked gate?). Natasha enters the barn and Jason 
    whispers for her to come to him, someone is watching them. It's 
    Charlie and he's blocking the barn door so they can't escape. Tony 
    enters the barn and confronts Charlie. A fantastic battle between two 
    titans ensues, but only one can be <A HREF="charlies_farm_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/charlie's farm dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>the
     winner. Care to guess who that is? After pummeling Charlie with his 
    fists and nearly getting his eye poked out with a spike jutting out 
    of the wall, Tony loses his life when Charlie rips his throat out 
    with his monstrous hands. Jason tries to intervene, but fails 
    spectacularly, as Charlie cuts his throat with a knife, nearly 
    cutting his head off, holding Jason up by his hair as he bleeds out 
    in front of Natasha. So what happens to the world's worst actress? 
    She runs to Tony's car to avoid Charlie's wrath, as Charlie jumps on 
    the car, kicking out the windshield with his foot, knocking out 
    Natasha. When she wakes up, she's in a wooden pen in a cave. She 
    breaks free and tries to escape, only to find Charlie's trophy room, 
    where the mutilated corpses of her friends and the backpackers lie, 
    waiting to be eaten. She's saved by Blue, who pulls her out of the 
    hole in the ground. It turns out it was Blue who blew John Wilson's 
    head off with the shotgun back in the '80s. Charlie then kills Blue 
    and Natasha uses Blue's rifle to shoot Charlie, who falls in the hole 
    in the ground. As Natasha is about to leave in Tony's car, Charlie 
    appears behind her and thrusts Blue's rifle through her back until it 
    juts out her stomach. He then pulls the rifle out her body with a 
    single yank, killing her. Charlie then throws Natasha over his 
    shoulder and walks away. You didn't think there would be a happy 
    ending did you? I have to say that I like this film a lot more than I 
    thought I would (Thank you Michael!), even with Tara Reid as the 
    star, but she keeps her emoting to a minimum. This film is a perfect 
    throwback to '80s slasher films. It's very gory, has physical effects 
    that are outstanding and moves at a quick pace, thanks to 
    director/screenwriter Chris Sun (<B><A HREF="boar_2017.htm">BOAR</A></B> 
    - 2017; which I intend on reviewing very soon). If you like gory 
    slasher films (who doesn't?) than this is the film for you. It use to 
    be streaming free on Amazon Prime (it isn't anymore), but it can also 
    be found streaming on Tubi, with a minimum of short commercial 
    interruptions. I have to say this is one film starring Tara Reid that 
    I actually liked and you will probably like it, too. So what are you 
    waiting for?</FONT></FONT></P>

     <B><A HREF="contract_killers_2014.htm">CONTRACT KILLERS</A></B> 
    (2014) is a generic title for a slam-bang actioner that will remind a 
    lot of you of John Woo's '80s &amp; '90s bullet-ridden sagas. The 
    film opens with professional hitman Sebastian (Tony MacIver) ready to 
    kill a group of crooks performing a drug deal in a garage (they were 
    responsible for the death of his brother) when non-professional 
    hitman Marshall (James Trevena-Brown) bursts in guns blazing and 
    kills everyone except the main bad guy (They were responsible for the 
    murder of his wife and baby daughter in a shoot-out in a hospital 
    where his wife just gave birth). Just as the bad guy is about to 
    shoot Marshall, a shot rings out and the bad guy falls dead, a bullet 
    through his head. Sebastian appears and tells Marshall he should 
    always save a bullet for the unknown and they introduce themselves to 
    each other. As they are leaving the garage, one of the cars leaks 
    gasoline and explodes, sending both Marshall and Sebastian flying 
    through the air. When Marshall comes to, he hears the sound of police 
    sirens approaching and a critically injured Sebastian tells Marshall 
    to save himself and leave. Marshall picks up Sebastian and carries 
    him out of the garage and a friendship develops, even though 
    Sebastian has lost the use of his legs permanently. Two years pass 
    and we see an Asian man named Lee-Seng (Rob Young) arrive by private 
    jet, where he is picked up by two goons and driven to the office of a 
    nameless (so far) bad guy. This man has hired Lee-Seng (who is a man 
    of very few words), who is apparently the world's greatest hit man, 
    to kill five contract killers, giving him a phone with all the 
    information he needs to do the job, all in one night! He is to finish 
    his assignment by going to the house of Sebastian and ending his 
    life. We then see the first four contract killers performing their 
    hits, followed immediately by Lee-Seng killing them in various ways 
    (He likes to play games with the contract killers, always giving them 
    a chance to win, which<A HREF="contract_killers_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/contract killers 2014 dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="164" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    none of them do). The fifth contract killer is Marshall, who has 
    developed into a world-class hitman, thanks to Sebastian's tutelage. 
    When Marshall goes to his handler, Dorio (Dallas Barnett), to pick up 
    his assignment, he finds it strange that all the best hitmen are 
    performing their duties on the same night in the same city, something 
    that has never happened before. Dorio's niece, Annabella (Renee 
    Cataldo), is in love with Marshall and he may also be in love with 
    her, but he promises Dorio that he would never act on it, because his 
    lifestyle is no choice for a woman her age (or any age, for that 
    matter). That doesn't stop Annabella from acting on her urges, 
    though, much to Dorio's disappointment. Dorio tells Marshall to be 
    careful and he leaves to perform his hit, but he knows something is 
    very wrong. At the location of the hit, Lee-Seng appears and he and 
    Marshall get into a drag-down, knock-down martial arts battle, where 
    Lee-Seng impales Marshall in the side with a broken broom handle and 
    Marshall kicks Lee-Seng down a flight of stairs. Marshall, with a 
    piece of broom handle still impaled in his side, drives to Dorio's to 
    get patched up and Annabella takes care of him. Lee-Seng goes to the 
    man who hired him to report that he was unsuccessful killing 
    Marshall, so the nameless bad guy tells him to find Marshall and kill 
    him. Lee-Seng shows up at Dorio's bar and kills Dorio, but Marshall 
    is able to save Annabella and they both go to see Sebastian to see if 
    he knows just exactly what is happening. Sebastian, who gets along on 
    crutches (he refuses to use a wheelchair), tells Marshall that he has 
    no idea what is happening, as his handler, a police detective named 
    Callahan (Kerry Glamsch), hasn't mentioned a thing to him. It turns 
    out that Callahan is the nameless man who hired Lee-Seng to kill all 
    the contract killers, for reasons I will let you discover. I'm not 
    going to give away any more of the plot because this is an actioner 
    that doesn't play by the rules. It gives you a right when you were 
    looking for a left and continually surprises. The shoot-outs are 
    amazing (everyone seems to fire tracer bullets!) as bullet holes 
    appear everywhere, destroying everything in their path (Lots of 
    flying debris in the air). If you remember the gunplay in John Woo's <B><A HREF="killer_1989_john_woo.htm">THE
     KILLER</A></B> (1989), that's the kind of action that you will 
    experience here, as freshman feature film 
    director/editor/cinematographer Mathew John Pearson has a firm grip 
    of what an action film should look like. While there is some CGI 
    blood in this film (especially the headshots), it is quick enough to 
    not be as noticeable as other actioners that use it. The fights are 
    especially satisfying, as there are no over-amped sound effects that 
    accompany every punch and kick, keeping it fairly realistic and 
    satisfying. As a matter of fact, the entire film is a satisfying 
    experience, especially if you are a hardcore action fan like me. What 
    is amazing is that it's near the end of 2020 as I write this and 
    Mathew John Pearson has yet to direct another feature (he has 
    directed a few shorts). The actors in the film, although basically 
    unknown, do a good job in their roles and the screenplay, by Michael 
    Yee,&nbsp; manages to throw a lot of twists and turns into the plot. 
    When I usually watch an action film, I basically know how it is going 
    to end and who is going to live or die, but this film really did 
    surprise me. There's an instance where Marshall and Lee-Seng find 
    themselves the targets of Callahan's killers, so you would think they 
    would team-up to defeat the onslaught, but, no, they end up battling 
    it out with each other until one of them is dead. You can find this 
    film streaming on Amazon Prime and Tubi. It is also available on 
    YouTube, but I refuse to use them any more because everything shown 
    is covered with commercials (I was watching a music video there and 
    they interrupted it mid-song for a commercial! That's just fucking 
    insane and greedy.).;<A NAME="CircusOfTheDead2014"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B><A HREF="circus_of_the_dead_2014.htm">CIRCUS
     OF THE DEAD</A></B> (2014) is not a film you just watch, it is a 
    film you suffer through, but in a good way (if that's even 
    possible!). The film opens with a quote from John Wayne Gacy 
    (&quot;Clowns can get away with murder&quot;), as we watch clown Papa 
    Corn (Bill Oberst Jr., this generation's Richard Lynch) putting on 
    his makeup and looking at some cards (&quot;It's like Bingo, except 
    it's from Mexico&quot;) while a woman sits besides him and a crowd of 
    people under a big top shout &quot;Bring out the clowns!&quot;. Papa 
    Corn and his crew of clowns, which includes Noodledome (Ryan Clapp), 
    a cannibal, Mister Blister (Rusty Edwards), a chain-smoker, Pepe The 
    Mime (Kyle Mueller), who loves his chainsaw, and the dimutive Jumbo 
    (Mike Williams), who wears a puppet on his hand and has a thing for 
    guns, then show us that they have a closet full of male and female 
    victims tied-up in their trailer, and they pull out a man called <A HREF="circus_of_the_dead_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/circus of the dead poster24a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="209" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>Brandon
     (Jed Duesler), cut off his hand with an electric knife and cauterize 
    the wound with a blowtorch to keep him alive (nothing is left to the 
    imagination; they even duct tape his severed hand back on his arm!). 
    They then take Brandon in front of an appreciative audience, where 
    all the clowns are dressed as old-timey cops and they beat Brandon 
    silly with clubs (the audience thinks it is all fake). Papa Corn 
    notices married couple Donald (Parrish Randall) and Tiffany (Chanel 
    Ryan) in the audience with their two young daughters, Alyssa (Jordan 
    Bell) and Hillary (Madi Lane) and chooses them as his gang's next 
    victims (He uses the Mexican bingo cards to match their images, but 
    the reason is never explained and is terribly underwritten). While 
    Donald is at work and the kids are at school, Papa Corn watches 
    through a window as Tiffany is having an affair with black cop T.C. 
    (Roger Edwards). When they start making love, Papa Corn violently 
    masturbates against the window (it's very hard to watch, as his 
    saliva just drips and spits out of his mouth) and then he and his 
    gang invade the house, kill T.C. with a chainsaw and Papa Corn rapes 
    Tiffany and then viciously murders her, cutting off her head (and 
    using her severed head to get some head!). When the kids come home, 
    they are kidnapped by the clown gang. As Donald comes home and sees 
    his headless wife, the clown gang attacks, as Papa Corn tells Donald 
    if he wants to see his daughters alive, he will do exactly as he 
    says. Papa Corn then puts Donald through unimaginable torture, using 
    him as a criminal in their big top show and then forcing him to 
    murder innocent people, threatening to kill his daughters if he 
    doesn't. The ending is particularly depressing, as Papa Corn is no 
    fool, his dastardly plan is well thought-out. He frames Donald for 
    all the murders (a drugged Donald wakes up in his car and discovers 
    his dead daughters are in the back seat), as the police surround his 
    car and tell him to come out with his hands in the air. Donald has no 
    other choice but to shoot himself in the head (after all, his wife 
    and kids are dead) and the clowns get away with bloody, gory murder 
    and return to their big top show, the audience yelling, &quot;Bring 
    out the clowns!&quot; This is an extremely graphic and gory film (in 
    both violence and sexual depravation, as Papa Corn likes to pull down 
    his pants, show his female victims his misshapen penis [and, yes, we 
    do see it, albeit briefly] and rapes them before making Donald kill 
    them. There is some very black comedy in this film, as when Donald 
    calls Papa Corn a liar and he replies, &quot;&#145;I may be a 
    homicidal serial rapist whose day job happens to be a clown, but 
    I&#146;m not a liar!&#146;&quot; and telling his victims &quot;Papa 
    Corn loves you&quot; before disposing of them. 
    Director/co-screenwriter Billy 'Bloody Bill' Pon shot this film in 
    his hometown of Odessa, Texas and it looks fantastic for a film made 
    with only a $150,000 budget. The crater-faced Bill Oberst Jr. never 
    shows his true self, always wearing white pancake makeup (Looking 
    somewhat like Al The Clown in <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad_page2.htm#Terrifier2016">TERRIFIER</A></B> 
    [2016], or, I should say, Al looks like him!) and he is simply 
    terrific and terrifying as Papa Corn. This is not a film for the 
    weak-stomached, as you will see some very disgusting and very gory 
    sights (the woman with Papa Corn in the beginning of the film turns 
    out to be one of his victims, as, when the camera pulls back, we can 
    see that she is holding her own heart in a jar!). I'm not going to 
    discuss the other gory sights on view because it is best if you 
    experience them for yourself. Stay tuned after the closing credits 
    end (where a hilarious rockabilly tune plays, where the lyrics are 
    &quot;If you love the Lord you fuckin' fuck&quot;) for an extended 
    surprise, where we are introduced to <B><A HREF="circus_of_the_dead_2014.htm#DollBoyShort2010">DOLL
     BOY</A></B>, a 2010 short film by Billy 'Bloody Bill' Pon of the 
    same name that was the basis for this film. We also discover 
    Brandon's fate. This is not a film for everyone, but if you like 
    extreme cinema, you are bound to love this. I know I did.;<A NAME="KungFuKiller2014"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     &nbsp;<B><A HREF="kung_fu_killer_2014.htm">KUNG FU KILLER</A></B> 
    (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="kung_fu_killer_2014.htm#KungFuJungle">KUNG FU JUNGLE</A></B> 
    - 2014) is a slam-bang martial arts actioner that puts a little 
    horror into the mix.&nbsp; Donnie Yen stars as Hahou Mo, a martial 
    arts instructor for the police who is in his third year of a five 
    year prison sentence for manslaughter, incarcerated there when he 
    accidentally killed a man who challenged him to a duel to see who was 
    the best martial arts champion. When he spots a report of a murder on 
    the prison TV, he gets into a massive kung fu fight (Him against 
    about twenty prisoners, where he hold his own), just so he can 
    convince prison guards to let him talk to the detective in charge of 
    the case, female Inspector Luk Yuen-Sum (Charlie Yeung). Hahou tells 
    the Inspector this won't be the last murder by<A HREF="kung_fu_killer_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/kung fu killer poster10a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    this killer, but she doesn't believe him, even though he rattles off 
    names of the next victims as she leaves, telling her she will return. 
    Sure enough, the killer, Fung Yu-Sau (Baoqiang Wang), kills one of 
    the people Hahou named, a former champion of a grappling-type martial 
    arts style, who is now an artist working on a very strange (but 
    fascinating) giant skeleton statue (the fight is very good, even if 
    it relies on wire work a little too much). The Inspector releases 
    Hahou from prison, promising him if he helps her catch the killer, 
    she will makes sure he serves no more time in prison. The Inspector 
    is under extreme pressure to solve these murders by her superior, 
    Chief Inspector Lam (Alex Fong), who himself is put under pressure by 
    his superiors, telling the Inspector she has three days to solve the 
    case or she will be re-assigned to a crappy position. Hahou reunites 
    with the love of his life, Sinn Ying (Bing Bai) and vows to protect 
    her, but does he know who the killer is and why he is murdering 
    martial arts champions in the fields of their expertise? We discover 
    that Fung Yu-Sau has a pretty wife who is dying of cancer and watches 
    her suffer in bed, moaning in pain. He loses all sense of reality 
    when he strangles his wife with his bare hands to put her out of her 
    misery. You see, he was born with one leg shorter than the other (his 
    right shoe has about a six-inch-high sole so he can walk 
    &quot;normally&quot;, but he still limps) and had to learn how to 
    deal with his imperfect body by practicing martial arts for hours 
    every day, until he practically became unbeatable. His twisted mind 
    thinks that &quot;Martial arts is only good for killing&quot; and 
    tries to prove his point by challenging every martial arts champion 
    to a fight and killing them, leaving a tiny dragon-like statue 
    impaled in their bodies (It is explained in the film). It turns out 
    that Fung Yu-Sau visited Hahou in prison and told him he was going to 
    kill Sinn Ying so Hahou would give up his pacifist ways (he quit 
    martial arts after accidentally killing the man in a duel and became 
    a model prisoner, that is, until he beat the shit out of twenty of 
    his fellow prisoners!) and take him on in an actual duel to the 
    death. The only reason why Hahou wanted out of prison was to protect 
    Sinn Ying and when the Inspector finds this out, Hahou is now wanted 
    for being an accesory to murder. I could go on with the story (which 
    is quite good), but it is the fight scenes we all came to watch and 
    they are simply fantastic. While a lot of wire work is utilized (it 
    usually takes me right out of a film, but not here),&nbsp; the fights 
    are brutal and bloody (one former champion gets his throat slit with 
    a box cutter) and hold your attention, especially the final fight 
    between Hahou and Fung Yu-Sau, which takes place on a highway teeming 
    with traffic, as they battle each other with their hands and then 
    twenty foot bamboo poles! Director Teddy Chan (a.k.a. &quot;Teddy 
    Chen&quot;; an actor in such films as <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#ILoveMariaRoboforce">I
     LOVE MARIA</A></B> - 1998 and a screenwriter on the Jet Li actioner <B><A HREF="black_mask_1996.htm">BLACK
     MASK</A></B> - 1996) populates the film with a lot of well-regarded 
    martial arts actors (including Bey Logan) and producers (including 
    the late Raymond Chow) in cameo roles and dedicates the film to them 
    during the closing credits (which includes short snippets of film not 
    used in the movie), but it's the action scenes that impress here, so 
    if you like films paced very fast and violence amped-up to the 
    extreme, then this is the film for you.;&nbsp; <A NAME="Good2015"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    is another quality Jean-Claude Van Damme DTV action flick that plays 
    on an old wive's tale with a twist. Van Damme is Deacon, who saves 
    woman Ana (Charlotte Peters; her first film) from a beating from the 
    dastardly Drake (Darren Shahlavi; <B><A HREF="born_to_raise_hell_2010.htm">BORN

     42 in January 2015), only to bed Ana, get drugged and wake up in a 
    bathtub full of ice with a kidney missing. Problem is, one of his 
    kidneys is supposed to go to his ultra-religious brother George's 
    (John Ralston; <B><A HREF="kaw_2007.htm">KAW</A></B> - 2007) 
    daughter. Deacon had an affair with George's wife years ago (she is 
    now deceased) and since George shoots blanks, it wasn't hard to 
    figure out that the baby girl was Deacon's (but George raises her as 
    his own, while Deacon has never met her). It puts a wide personal and 
    family gap between Deacon and George, but Deacon still wants his 
    &quot;daughter/niece&quot; to get his kidney. Now they must work 
    together to get the kidney back before it is transplanted into anyone 
    else and it's a great bloody ride, full of many fights, gunfights and 
    some fantastic stunts. Director Ernie Barbarash (<B><A HREF="ticking_clock_2011.htm">TICKING
     CLOCK</A></B> - 2011), working with a screenplay by Joshua James, 
    infuses some new life into an old concept and it could only end one 
    way, but it still is sad (especially after they see who Deacon's 
    removed kidney is going to). The fights between Van Damme (who lost 
    weight and looks gaunt for this role) and the late Darren Shahlavi 
    are fantastic (the film is dedicated to him) and look for good turns 
    by Aki Aleong, Jason Tobin, Andrew Ng and Mike Leeder. Filmed in 
    China, the Philippines and Canada; <B><A HREF="amigo_undead_2015.htm">AMIGO
     UNDEAD</A></B> (2015) is catagorized as a &quot;zombie comedy&quot; 
    but it is actually a demon possession comedy film. Well-off financial 
    advisor Kevin Ostrowski (Randall Park, who gets quite a few remarks 
    about an Asian having that name and gets tired of saying he was 
    adopted) is guilted into going on a birthday vacation with his 
    adopted brother Norm Ostrowski (Steve Agee), because Norm says he was 
    just diagnosed with diabetes and would like his brother to be there 
    with him and with some friends. Turns out Norm and some weird friends 
    are having a party out in the desert and when one of the friends 
    chokes and dies while eating a hotdog, they bury him in the desert, 
    rather than going to the police. Too bad they buried him on sacred 
    ancient Native American soil, because the man comes back as an 
    indestructable Native American demon (some of the scenes when the 
    group try to kill him are very funny, especially the hand grenade 
    scene). There are some standout scenes in this movie, such as when a 
    cop stops the group and tests them by asking one of them to &quot;Suck
     my dick&quot;, David Clennon (the man who said &quot;What the 
    fuck?&quot; to the spider/head creature in <B><A HREF="thing_1982.htm">THE
     THING</A></B> - 1982) as &quot;Old Man Schumer&quot;, who is so 
    funny, you will pee your pants and the two Native American people, 
    one who talks to the demon in hilarious subtitled Indian tongue. 
    There's a lot to recommend here, especially the scenes between 
    brothers Kevin and Norm (Norm is a liar of the highest degree, yet 
    you still end up rooting for him) and the way Kevin gets revenge on 
    the man who keeps on calling him looking for a huge payout for a 
    minor car accident because he thinks Kevin is rich. Financed 
    partially by web-funding site Indiegogo (which would explain all the 
    names that appear during the final credits), this was money well 
    spent.; <B><A HREF="dark_places_2015.htm">DARK PLACES</A></B> (2015) 
    makes me wonder what is wrong with Hollywood. This is the perfect 
    example of why people see mindless stuff in theaters and watch 
    thought-provoking films like this on streaming or disc. The amazing 
    Charlize Theron is fantastic as Libby Day who, when she was eight 
    years-old in 1985, testified that her brother Ben (Tye Sheridan) 
    killed her mother and two sisters. Now in the present, Libby is in a 
    conundrum: she was living off the kindness of strangers, who would 
    send her checks for surviving such a horrible crime, but like her 
    financial advisor tells her, people forget and move on to the next 
    murder (this is the absolute truth). She only has $482 in the bank 
    and is two months behind on her rent. Then she meets Lyle Wirth 
    (Nicholas Hoult), who is part of a &quot;Kill Club&quot;, an 
    Innocence Project-like organization who believes Ben (now played by 
    Corey Stall, who is also excellent) is innocent of the crime and 
    Libby is a master manipulator, getting money out of Lyle to supply 
    him with information and get out of debt. Then she goes to see Ben in 
    prison for the first time since her family was murdered. Ben has no 
    ill feelings towards Libby, but is angry at other people for framing 
    him for the murders, solely based on him dying his hair black, being 
    falsely accused of pedophilia and hanging with the wrong crowd. Now 
    Libby has doubts about what really happened and begins her own 
    investigation. The plot, which keeps reverting from the 80's to 
    today, involves the satanic cult phenomena that was so widely spread 
    in the mid-80's (and proved to be untrue, but harmed countless 
    people), kids being coached by their parents to accuse people of 
    improperly touching them (Ben and his family are on Welfare and are 
    looked at as second class citizens in town), homelessness, teen 
    pregnancy, the fear of being left with nothing and what really 
    happened on that night when Libby's family was murdered. It will not 
    only break your heart (no clues from me), but will literally have you 
    in tears, especially Libby's last visit with Ben in prison (which 
    holds a lot more meaning in its underlying tones, and pay close 
    attention on what is missing and what is now part of Libby's attire). 
    This is my favorite thriller (based on the novel by Gillian Flynn, 
    who also wrote <B><A HREF="gone_girl_2014.htm">GONE GIRL</A></B> 
    [2014]; she has a cameo here as a member of the Kill Club) of 2015 
    and held me spellbound from start to finish. Also great turns by 
    Andrea Roth, Christina Hendricks, Chlo&euml; Grace Moretz, Drea de 
    Matteo, Glenn Morshower, Sterling Jerins as the young Libby Day, Sean 
    Bridgers as scumbag father Runner Day and especially director/screenwriter
     Gilles Paquet-Brenner (<B><A HREF="walled_in_2009.htm">WALLED IN</A></B>

    turns in a nearly perfect film. Watch it when you can; <B><A HREF="awaken_2015.htm">AWAKEN</A></B> 
    (2015) is an unusual film where a group of strangers wake up on an 
    island occupied by mercenaries, who are working for a medical team 
    harvesting human organs. Each one of these strangers has been picked 
    out because they have a particular compatible organ for a rich person 
    willing to pay for it. What they didn't count on that Billie Burke 
    (Natalie Burn), who was looking for her missing sister in Mexico when 
    she was taken, is also a champion judo fighter (and is not on the 
    island for her organs, but because she got too close to the truth). 
    It takes a stun gun by head mercenary Vinnie Jones to bring her down.

     CAR</A></B> (2015) is a wonderfully twisted little Independent 
    award-winning thriller with comedy and violence mixed with equal 
    measure. Two pre-teen boys are running away from home, thinking of 
    curse words as they walk through a meadow (filmed in Colorado 
    Springs, Colorado). They come upon a tree-filled part of the meadow 
    and find an empty Sheriff's cop car sitting in the middle of the 
    trees. They also find the keys and decide to go for a joyride, not 
    knowing that they are carrying cargo in the trunk that will ruin 
    their day. We are then transported to about an hour earlier, where we 
    see the Sheriff (a mustached Kevin Bacon, also the Executive 
    Producer) parking the car in the tree-filled meadow and pulling a 
    body out of the trunk, dragging it by dropcloth to a nearby well and 
    throwing the body in, followed by some lime to hide the smell of 
    decomposition. When he goes back to retrieve the second body (which 
    is still alive), he discovers that the car is gone and must be quick 
    on his feet, first stealing a car in a trailer park (where he is 
    almost captured by a motorcycle cop, but he tells the police 
    dispatcher [the voice of Kyra Sedgwick, Bacon's real-life wife] that 
    all cops need to go to a fake crime that is happening across town, so 
    the motorcycle cop leaves). A sub-plot finds one of the kids' 
    stepmother (Camryn Manheim) spotting her stepson driving the cop car 
    on the highway, but she can't get any cops to believe her, so she 
    goes searching for them herself. It all ends with the two kids 
    releasing the guy in the trunk (Shea Whigham) and everythying goes to 
    shit. He locks the kids in the back seat of the car (anyone who has 
    been in the back seat of a caged cop car knows that the doors don't 
    open from the inside) and waits for the Sheriff to arrive while he 
    hides in a nearby oil well, ready to shoot him with an automatic 
    weapon. Also arriving at the scene is the kids' stepmother and the 
    Sheriff puts her life in extreme danger. It turns extremely violent 
    (something you should experience yourself) and ends with one of the 
    boys traveling 100mph down the highway, with the shot Sheriff 
    following them, to get his shot friend to a hospital. Don't look for 
    any type of ending, because you'll have to make one up in your mind. 
    With this kind of film, you won't mind, because it could only end up 
    one of two ways. Especially effective are James Freedson-Jackson and 
    Hays Wellford as the kids, as they have no idea that weapons have 
    locking features, play with crimes scene tape and just give off an 
    air of playfulness, even in times of extreme danger.

    (2015) is screenwriter Ted Geoghegan's first stab at directing a 
    feature film (he also wrote it). He is best known for writing the 
    screenplays of the gore films <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Barricade2006">BARRICADE</A></B> 
    (2006), <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DontWakeDead2008">DON'T WAKE THE DEAD</A></B> 
    (2008) and <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Sweatshop2010">SWEATSHOP</A></B> 
    (2010), but he holds off on the gore in this film until the final 
    third and has collected quite an impressive cast. It's all about a 
    married couple, Anne &amp; Paul Sacchetti (Barbara Crampton &amp; 
    Andrew Sensenig), who have lost their son Bobby, moving into a 
    notorious haunted house that town bigshot Dave McCabe (Monte Markham, 
    a great actor I haven't seen on screen in a while) knows more about 
    then he is telling. The Sacchetti's are visited by psychic married 
    friends May &amp; Jacob Lewis (Lisa Marie &amp; Larry Fessenden, in 
    one of his biggest roles in a long time and it looks like he got rid 
    of that black tooth), who notice right away that there is something 
    wrong with the house and the Sacchetti's dead son Bobby has come to 
    the house with them. When the gore kicks in, it's quite unflinching 
    (both Fessenden and Markham's deaths are memorable) and the blood 
    flows like water when the townspeople come to the house to kill the 
    couple. The film keeps you guessing why the house is haunted until 
    the end, where newspaper clippings dating back from the 1800's to the 
    present describe what the house is all about as the end credits roll. 
    This is a reversal of most horror films, where they start with the 
    newspaper clippings in the opening credits. To give you all the 
    information you need to know. This film works better not knowing 
    until the end and Fessenden, who has directed some impressive films 
    of his own (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Wendigo">WENDIGO</A></B> 
    [2001] is still my favorite), shines here and usually makes quick 
    cameos in over 80 of other peoples' horror films (he helps out a lot 
    of first-time directors of independent films), but he has a lot of 
    screen time here and registers more than anyone else in the cast. 
    That's not to say anyone else is bad, because they are not, but it 
    was nice seeing one of my heroes in a film that gives him<A HREF="kill_kane_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/kill kane dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    time to have some type of background. Do yourself a favor and watch 
    the Dark Sky Films DVD or Blu-Ray, as the version shown on SyFy cuts 
    out some of the gorier bits. Thumbs-up on this one; <B><A HREF="kill_kane_2015.htm">KILL
     KANE</A></B> (2015) is a nice, taut little revenge film (it is only 
    75 minutes long) that gives Vinnie Jones one of the biggest roles of 
    his career. When the film opens, Ray Brookes (Jones) wakes up in a 
    hospital with a doctor telling him that they had to put him in an 
    induced coma for three months while he recuperated from gunshot to 
    his chest. We then find out through a series of flashbacks what 
    actually happened to him and why he is refusing to cooperate with 
    Detective Inspector Shelby (Sebastian Street) assigned to the case. 
    It seems that phys-ed teacher Ray and his wife Kim (Nicole Faraday) 
    got lost while driving and Ray gets out of the car to get a map out 
    of the trunk (or as the English call it &quot;the boot&quot;). He 
    hears a noise and witnesses the execution of a man by a mobster and 
    his three goons, one of them named Kane (Sean Cronin, who is also 
    excellent), who is the mobster's right-hand man. Ray gets in his car 
    when he is spotted and drives away, telling Kim what he just saw. 
    Unfortunately, Kane got their license plate number and a couple of 
    days later, he and his two goon members invade Ray's house and tie 
    Ray up, forcing him to watch as Kane and the other two men shoot 
    Ray's wife, teenage daughter and son in the head and then shoot Ray 
    in the chest (the funny thing is that Ray probably wasn't going to 
    report seeing the execution). When Ray gets out of the hospital, he 
    goes on a one-man mission to take down everyone involved in his 
    family's death (while frequently fleshing out how his family died in 
    more detailed flashbacks). The rest of the films shows him doing just 
    that, working his way up the leadership line, killing them in 
    different manners. Shelby knows what Ray is doing, but is unable to 
    come up with evidence against Ray, until he catches Ray and Kane in a 
    Mexican standoff in a warehouse, each pointing a gun at each other's 
    head. Ray kills Kane with a bullet to the head and Shelby lets him go 
    with the warning that he get out of town and never return (shades of <B><A HREF="death_wish_1974.htm">DEATH
     WISH</A></B> - 1974). But Ray has one more person to deal with and 
    the way he gets retribution is fast and tidy. Freshman feature 
    director/co-writer Adam Stephen Kelly tosses all unneeded exposition 
    aside and just gives us a down-and-dirty little revenge thriller, 
    even going as far as to make sure that Vinnie Jones looks like an old 
    and out of shape person after being in a coma for three months. You 
    have never seen Jones like this before. All in all, a very good and 
    violent film with no other aspirations than to show us the good stuff 
    and toss aside all the usual unneeded crap. This low-budget film was 
    shot in nine days in South Wales, but still holds your attention 
    throughout. Recommended.</FONT></FONT></P>

     never watched those films and just hated him for hate's sake, like 
    they do to Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino. Anyway, back to the film 
    in question. It's basically a found footage film (yes, I know, but it 
    works here) about two teens, Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed 
    Oxenbould), making a home movie about meeting their grandparents for 
    the first time, while their mother (Kathryn Hahn) takes a one week 
    cruise with her boyfriend. Mother and her parents haven't talked to 
    each other for over 15 years for reasons not made clear until the end 
    of the film, so Mom puts the kids on a train and keeps in contact 
    with them on a laptop using Skype. The kids finally meet Pop Pop 
    (Peter McRobbie) and Nana (Deanna Dunagan, but Lin Shaye would have 
    been perfect here) and right away they notice something strange about 
    their grandparents. Nana likes to cook a lot (And asks Becca to crawl 
    in the oven to clean the back because she is too old to do so. Becca 
    does it twice!) and Pop Pop has a secret in a shed that he doesn't 
    want anyone to see (Nana tells the kids that Pop Pop is incontinent 
    and he puts all his adult diaper &quot;accidents&quot; there!). They 
    also insist that the kids don't leave their bedroom after 9:30 PM and 
    when Tyler (who is a very talented rapper in this film) breaks that 
    rule and sees Nana cleaning the house in the nude, Becca (who never 
    looks at herself in the mirror) insists that their grandparents are 
    going through &quot;Sundowning&quot; (Google it, as it once was 
    considered to be the title of the film). More strange stuff happens, 
    sometimes funny, sometimes scary as hell, until a real surprise 
    happens about 80% of the way through the film, where a reveal makes 
    the kids try to run for their lives. To say any more would ruin the 
    film for you, and besides a few instances of the digital cameras 
    shaking wildly, this is not a headache-inducing found footage film, 
    unlike 90% of the others. M. Night Shyamalan, who not only directed, 
    but also wrote the screenplay, has nothing to be ashamed of here (The 
    final piece of footage that plays over the end credits, which Becca 
    says her brother made her insert into the film, is a hoot and answers 
    some nagging questions [watch Becca in the background].). Even though 
    it is Rated PG-13, there are so many strange things going on 
    (including a bare-assed Nana and Pop Pop sucking on the barrel of a 
    loaded shotgun), that you won't notice the lack of blood or gore 
    (although there is some). The two actors playing the teens are also 
    excellent in their roles and make the story believable (you would 
    never know they were both Australian since this was filmed in 
    Philadelphia, Shyamalan's home state), as do the actors portraying 
    the grandparents. This film was shown in theaters, where it made 65 
    million dollars in the U.S. on a 5 million dollar budget (financed 
    using Shyamalan's fee for <B>AFTER EARTH</B>, so he would have 
    complete control of the film and not have it taken away from him 
    during post-production, like many of his major studio films were in 
    the recent past), so it can be considered a hit. Add his cult TV 
    series <B><A HREF="wayward_pines_tv_series_2015.htm">WAYWARD PINES</A></B> 
    into the mix and Shyamalan is back, baby, and throwing his talent 
    into the critics' faces.;&nbsp; I had huge hopes for director Michael 
    Dougherty's <B><A HREF="krampus_2015.htm">KRAMPUS</A></B> (2015; 
    Satan's version of Santa. Ever wonder how &quot;Satan&quot; and 
    &quot;Santa&quot; have the same exact letters?), since his last 
    feature film was the extremely good 2007 anthology film <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#TrickRTreat">TRICK
     'R TREAT</A></B> (even though it was an anthology, all the stories 
    were related in a peripheral way), and I have to say I wasn't 
    disappointed, even though it was Rated PG-13. Unlike his previous 
    film, this horror comedy holiday film isn't interested in blood and 
    gore (although there is some), but more about primal fear during 
    Christmas time. A young boy named Max (Emjay Anthony) tears up his 
    letter to Santa after one of his young male relatives&nbsp; reads his 
    letter out loud at the dinner table (One of Max's wishes was that his 
    mother and father love each other again, played perfectly by Toni 
    Collette and Adam Scott). The film doesn't take it's time to release 
    the terror as the electricity goes out in the entire town and Max's 
    grandma Omi (Krista Stadler) describes to Max (in stop-motion 
    animation!) how she released Krampus when she was a girl by doing the 
    same thing Max did: tear up her letter to Santa and quit believing in 
    him (throwing her stuffed doll of Santa into the fireplace). She 
    witnesses Krampus and his assistants (who must be seen to be 
    believed!) take away her parents, but Krampus leaves Omi alone (after 
    giving her a wink!). Soon the entire family, including visiting 
    relatives (which includes an always reliable David Koechner as a 
    gun-loving man the NRA would love, Allison Tolman as his wife, the 
    amazing Conchata Ferrell as the ascerbic and eternally drunk Aunt 
    Dorothy [Who kicks butt in one scene. As a matter of fact, every 
    relative you were beginning to hate, step up to the plate to keep the 
    family together.] and about six children.) are fighting Krampus and 
    his minions, which includes toys come to life, man-eating reindeer, 
    monstrous elves, and something I can't describe in the attic (the 
    funniest part is when Koechner has to fight-off three gingerbread men 
    firing a nailgun at him!), while the children disappear one-by-one. I 
    don't want to give away any more of the plot except to say it is up 
    to Max to convince Krampus to return all his family back. Just when 
    you think the film ends happily, you are thrown a surprise which 
    proves otherwise. Michael Dougherty, who co-wrote the screenplay with 
    Todd Casey &amp; Zach Shields, is a director to really keep an eye on 
    (his next film is a sequel to his Halloween film that will be 
    released theatrically with a larger budget this time), as he knows 
    how to push our buttons effectively. If you want to see a horror 
    comedy capable of still giving you goosebumps, by all means get your 
    hands on <B><A HREF="krampus_2015b.htm">KRAMPUS</A></B>. You will 
    thank me for it. PG-13 doesn't always mean crap. The opening will 
    have you laughing with tears streaming down your face because it is 
    true. Also imaginative are the way the Universal Pictures logo and 
    Legendary Pictures logo are shown in the beginning.; Everyone knows I 
    love horror films that take place in amusement parks or contains 
    clowns. <B><A HREF="funhouse_massacre_2015.htm">THE FUNHOUSE MASSACRE</A></B> 
    (2015) contains both. The film opens on Halloween Night, with 
    reporter Ms. Eileen Quinn (Candice De Visser) threatening to expose 
    the prison in the middle of town that is being kept secret from the 
    surrounding residents unless the Warden (Robert Englund, doing his 
    usual 5 minute cameo) takes her on a tour of it. The Warden tells her 
    that even though Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, John Wayne Gacy and other 
    famous serial killers have received all the Press, his prison holds 
    some of<A HREF="funhouse_massacre_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/funhouse massacre dvd front8a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    the worst serial killers today, even if they are not well known (He 
    whispers to Eileen, &quot;There are people in here that God is even 
    afraid of!&quot;). He shows them to Eileen and they include Animal 
    The Cannibal (E.E. Bell), whose crimes are self-explanatory; The 
    Taxidermist (Clint Howard), who likes to create new human bodies by 
    stitching different sawdust-filled body parts together; Rocco The 
    Brute (Mars Crain), who has killed all his opponents in the wrestling 
    ring and later rips the face off a clown and wears his face!; Dr. 
    Suave (Sebastian Siegel), who likes to remove teeth without the use 
    of Novocaine; and the worst of them all, &quot;Mental Manny&quot; 
    (Jere Burns), who once was the leader of a cult and set a girl on 
    fire. Eileen follows the Warden to his office and garrotes the Warden 
    so bad his head nearly come off and then kills a guard by stabbing 
    him in the balls and then his back, stealing his gun. She then goes 
    to the Control Room and kills the operator. She shoots him in the 
    heart and beats his head in with her special walking stick and sets 
    all the serial killers free. It turns out she is &quot;Dollface&quot;,
     the daughter of Mental Manny, who is now the leader of all the 
    serial killers. Dollface has set up the the local amusement park, The 
    Land Of Illusion, with a special attraction called &quot;The 
    Funhouse&quot; for Halloween, so that every room replicates the 
    escaped serial killers' crimes and they first kill the Funhouse's 
    director Dennis (Courtney Gains), but the one-dimentional cliched 
    sex-crazed paying guests (the film's only failure) think it is all 
    part of the show (The Taxidermist is removing the innards of a real 
    human and the guests take a piece of the innards as a souvenir!) 
    until they begin to disappear one-by-one. It is not long until these 
    mental midgets begin to figure out that all the actors supposedly 
    playing the serial killers are the real thing and there is no way to 
    escape. Who will survive and what will be left of them? Can Sheriff 
    Kate (Scottie Thompson), the only non-serial killer with a brain (her 
    Deputy, played by Ben Begley, is even more stupid than the guests at 
    The Funhouse, but proves to be pretty handy with a gun as the film 
    progresses), solve and put an end to this massacre (she is also 
    hiding a secret of her own)? Director Andy Palmer (<B><A HREF="badlands_of_kain_2016.htm">BADLANDS
     OF KAIN</A></B> - 2016), working with a screenplay by Ben Begley 
    (his first feature screenplay), keeps things moving at a bloody quick 
    pace (there's a juicy sequence where Rocco grabs the head of an 
    audience member and pulls it off that is very well done, a graphic 
    scene done with a carnival hammer [the kind you use to ring a bell], 
    as is the scene were Dollface cuts a girl's head off with a knife; 
    effects by Robert Kurtzman) and fills the film with some welcome 
    faces, but the stereotypical stupid people (most who are killed three 
    quarters of the way through the film) that usually inhabit films like 
    this almost made me put the film in the other category, but like I 
    said in the beginning, I am a sucker for films that take place at 
    amusements parks and carnivals. I'll leave it up to you whether you 
    like it or not. There was enough in this film for me to give it a 
    positive review. Stay until after the end credits for a final 
    stinger.; I am a big fan of director William Kaufman, which is why I

    (2012). Even though the plot of this film has been done over 100 
    times, in Kaufman's hands he makes it seem brand new. This film takes 
    place in the near future, where a few years ago a plague hits the 
    entire planet and those that were infected were turned into a 
    combination of vampire/zombie mutants (They burn up in the sun but 
    have no fangs and hide in the darkness during the day. They eat human 
    flesh, but can be killed by bullets on any part of their body, not 
    just in the head.) Enter Thomas Rourke (Johnny Strong, the star of 
    Kaufman's <B><A HREF="sinners_and_saints_2010.htm">SINNERS AND SAINTS</A></B> 
    - 2010) who has driven in his car from New York to Dallas, Texas 
    (filmed on location) as a one-man mutant killer (When we first see 
    him, he is dragging a freezer out of a gas station with a chain 
    attached to his car, shoots it open and watches a mutant burn to 
    death in the sun), looking for the head mutant called &quot;The 
    Alpha&quot; (Krzysztof Soszynski) who killed his wife (Strong not 
    only directed his own dream sequences, he also wrote the film's music 
    score!). Rourke saves the life of Sam (Chelsea Edmundson), who was 
    looking for survivors with her squad, only for all of them to get 
    killed by a band of human scum nomads. Rourke kills them all (They 
    try to rape Sam) and Sam offers to take him to safety, where he can 
    get all the gas, ammunition and food that he can carry with him. It 
    turns out &quot;safety&quot; is a prison (Where is the safest place 
    to hide from mutants after all?), where Sam's leader, Frank Hill (an 
    excellent Lance Henriksen, who gets more screen time than usual 
    nowadays), doesn't trust Rourke at first, but will soon become very 
    helpful to him in getting their group of survivors to a charter plane 
    about a 90 minute drive away. Trouble is, the leader of the pack of 
    mutants in this town is The Alpha, the one Rourke has been looking 
    for since New York and is much smarter and stronger than all the 
    other mutants (He takes several bullets, but it doesn't phase him.). 
    The Alpha recognizes Rourke and decides that the group is going 
    nowhere, so he has the mutants block the roads both ways with 
    inoperable cars and other heavy junk and jams the door where Frank's 
    group store their vehicles, so they can't leave. The rest of the film 
    is a mixture of exciting chases and acts of retribution and 
    self-sacrifice, the elements that Kaufman is known for in his films. 
    This film is full of human emotion, like where Frank's son, Ethan 
    (Louis Mandylor), takes an instant like to Rourke and volunteers to 
    help Rourke to kill all the mutants, including The Alpha, while they 
    sleep in the basement of a highrise during the day, much to Frank's 
    displeasure. While the film is bloody and full of squishy bullet 
    squibs, it is not overly gory like a zombie film. It you want to see 
    a dystopian film done right on a small budget, you can do no better 
    than this. In an interesting twist that is bound to be the new thing 
    of the future (3D is thankfully dying out), this film was also 
    released as an interactive virtual reality experience. Highly 
    recommended.; <B><A HREF="bad_ass_3_bad_asses_on_the_bayou_2015.htm">BAD

     and funny as the first two. In the second film, Frank's gym and 
    Bernie's liquor store were destroyed by the bad guys and this third 
    film opens with them in the bank trying to get a loan (which the bank 
    refuses), when the bank is held-up by three men in masks. Frank and 
    Bernie take care of them in no time (Frank throws someone's 
    autographed baseball right into one of the thief's crotch) and once 
    again they are in the news and being interviewed on a TV show. When 
    the interviewer asks if the bank gave them the loan for thwarting the 
    robbery, Bernie says, &quot;Hell no, but they gave us this shitty 
    plaque!&quot;. Frank and Bernie get a call from their sassy friend 
    Carmen (Lonni Love, who had a small part in the second film in the 
    same role), who tells them that she is getting married and invites 
    them to come down to Louisiana for the wedding, all for free. They 
    are picked up in a fancy limousine and fly to Louisiana, only to find 
    out Carmen's father Earl (John Amos) is a millionaire with quite a 
    huge mansion. At the pre-wedding celebration the night before the 
    ceremony, Frank and Bernie find out Carmen is marrying Geoffrey 
    (Sammi Rotibi), a man in a wheelchair. That night, there is a 
    break-in at Earl's mansion and Carmen is kidnapped. Frank tries to 
    fight them off, but there are just too many of them and he is 
    knocked-out. It is apparent to both Frank and Bernie that the Police 
    Chief Broussard (Davi Jay; it is spelled &quot;Cheif Broussard' in 
    the final credits) and some of his detectives are as crooked as a 
    corkscrew (except for one, who plays an important part in the 
    finale), so Frank and Bernie go back to their vigilante ways to find 
    Carmen, even though Chief Broussard warns them to stay away. Frank 
    and Bernie (Who always complains about kidney stones and how he is 
    willing to fight, but not run after, the bad guys. Seems like his 
    liver problems haven't been resolved since the second film.) start 
    kicking people's asses and taking names and begin to discover where 
    Carmen really is. Earl joins them in saving his daughter, which make 
    it a team of three geriatric vigilantes, which works out better than 
    they could have ever hoped for. Not to ruin the film for everyone who 
    hasn't seen it, they get into a series of gunfights and hand-to-hand 
    combat and are betrayed by the least likely person at the pre-wedding 
    party. The geriatric three save the day, take down Chief Broussard 
    (who was in on the ransom demand) and Earl makes Frank and Bernie an 
    offer they can't refuse, since he is rich and can find a new liver 
    for Bernie. Director/writer Craig Moss, who was also responsible for 
    the first two films, makes Trejo and Glover a fantastic, realistic 
    team. They talk to each other like normal friends who sometimes 
    disagree and the addition of John Amos to the team just makes the 
    film all the better. There is no Part 4 on the docket, but I hope 
    Moss changes his mind soon. And just in case you didn't notice: Just 
    like the first two films, there is a sequence in this film that was 
    &quot;borrowed&quot; from a major motion picture. In this film it is 
    the plane crash from the Mel Gibson film <B><A HREF="air_america_1990.htm">AIR
     AMERICA</A></B> (1990), but it is edited so so well into this film, 
    most people will never notice (Frank says &quot;Thank you for flying 
    Mexican Airlines!&quot;). I am so glad that Danny Trejo is getting 
    starring roles now. He has the chops for action, comedy and drama and 
    he is well into his 70's! Watch all three films in a row (they are 
    all easily available) and be completely entertained for five hours. 
    Like in the second film, Bernie gets the last laugh. And laugh I did. 
    I can't recommend this one enough.; <B><A HREF="midnight_special_2015.htm">MIDNIGHT
     SPECIAL</A></B> (2015) is another one of director/writer Jeff 
    Nichols' (<B><A HREF="take_shelter_2011.htm">TAKE SHELTER</A></B> - 
    2011; <B><A HREF="mud_2012.htm">MUD</A></B> - 2012)&nbsp;slow-burn 
    movies that captivates you from the very beginning. Actually, a lot 
    has gone on before the film even starts. Father Roy (the always 
    excellent Michael Shannon) and ex-State Trooper Lucas (Joel Edgerton) 
    have kidnapped Roy's son Alton (a haunting Jaeden Lieberher) from a 
    religious cult called The Ranch, led by powerful religious leader 
    Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard, in an extended cameo). Mr. Meyer wants 
    Alton back, because it is obvious that the boy is not normal. That is 
    putting it mildly. Alton wears a set of special blue goggles (even at 
    night). If he takes them off, beams of bright blue lights shoot out 
    of his eyes (at one time he aims the beams into the sky and hits a 
    nuclear satellite, and pieces of it fall to the ground, destroying a 
    gas station/convenience store). The film is basically a road movie 
    with a twist, as a special goverment agency has appointed a terribly 
    confused mathematician named Sevier (a great Adam Driver) to discover 
    what he can about Alton, and he comes to a conclusion that you, the 
    viewer, will just have to wait to see. Sevier becomes an ally to 
    Alton and Joe because he knows what the boy is. Just like all of Jeff 
    Nicols' films, the pace is purposely slow, but rewards the viewers 
    with surprises you didn't expect. The finale is a thing of beauty and 
    just like <B>TAKE SHELTER</B>, finds Michael Shannon staring into the 
    sky, only this time it is a good thing. Everyone in this film, 
    including Kirsten Dunst as Sarah, an ex-Ranch member, does a 
    fantastic job displaying the proper emotions that you or I would also 
    show in these situations. The film can be classified as science 
    fiction, thriller, drama, road movie and many other genre categories, 
    but for the patient, this film rewards in spades. Search it out. It<A HREF="forsaken_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/forsaken 2015 poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    played for a short while in theaters and VOD and got fantastic 
    reviews from most critics, but, so far, Nichols' films have not gone 
    into wide release. That is just so wrong, I have no more words to 
    say. Nichols is a modern-day master of filmmaking.; I usually don't 
    review Westerns (even though it is one of my favorite genre of film), 
    but I have to say a few words about <B><A HREF="forsaken_2015.htm">FORSAKEN</A></B> 
    (2015). The plot of the film is as old as the Western film itself: A 
    land baron (Brian Cox) sends out his hired killers, led by Gentleman 
    Dave Turner (an excellent Michael Wincott), to murder people for 
    their farmland, while an ex-gunfighter returns home after ten years 
    to visit his Pastor father and pay tribute to his deceased mother by 
    clearing off a piece of land and farming it. Now we all know what is 
    going to happen, but the difference here is that the ex-gunfighter is 
    played by Kiefer Sutherland and the Pastor is played by Keifer's 
    real-life father Donald Sutherland. Their scenes together&nbsp;(and 
    there are many) are mesmerizing and really give the film a kick up a 
    few notches. There dialogue is real and heartfelt (especially the 
    final time they talk) and give this film a heart and soul found in 
    very few modern day Westerns. Yes, there are bloody shootouts 
    (Kiefer's shootout at the finale is about as good as shootouts get, 
    with fingers and kneecaps blown off and lots of bullets to the head 
    and heart) and his final showdown with Gentleman Dave Turner does not 
    turn out the way you expected (Turner is really a decent man at heart 
    and hated all the killing that was going on, but he was hired to do a 
    job). If you want to see a recently made Western done right (and not 
    afraid to use Western cliches to its advantage) I recommend this film 
    whole-heartedly. The chemistry between Kiefer and Donald Sutherland 
    is about as real as it gets and if you don't shed a tear at their 
    final conversation, you really aren't human (And no, you don't know 
    how it ends!). Congratulations to director Jon Cassar (who usually 
    directs episodes of TV Series, especially plenty of episodes of 
    Kiefer Sutherland's <B><A HREF="24_tv_series.htm">24</A></B> [2001 - 
    2010] and has won Emmy Awards&reg; and DGA Awards&reg; for his TV 
    work), screenwriter Brad Mirman (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Resurrection1999">RESURRECTION</A></B> 
    - 1999; in 2011, he directed and wrote a 10-part Hulu web series

    John Hurt and the episodes were edited together and released to DTV 
    as <B><A HREF="confession_2011.htm">THE CONFESSION</A></B>.) and 
    especially the Sutherlands for turning out a Western with balls and 
    emotions. I have watched it three times so far and it gets better 
    every time. Look for Demi Moore as Kiefer's ex-girlfriend, who got 
    married and had a child while he was away, but still has feelings for 
    him and Aaron Poole as Frank Tillman, one of the scuzziest 
    trigger-happy <A HREF="last_girl_standing_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/last girl standing poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>killers
     in a Western film (he even kills one of his own men to cover-up his 
    ineptness!). By all means, catch it if you can!; <B><A HREF="last_girl_standing_2015.htm">LAST
     GIRL STANDING</A></B> (2015) has an interesting premise I don't 
    believe I have ever seen before. This film (funded mainly by 
    KickStarter) asks the question: If you were the only girl who 
    survived a massacre by a maniac called &quot;The Hunter&quot;, how 
    would this girl be doing both physically and mentally five years 
    later? The girl in question is Camryn (Akasha Villalobos) and she is 
    now working at a laundromat/dry cleaner, but she still fears that The 
    Hunter is after her (even though she saw him impaled by one of his 
    booby traps in the beginning of the film) and hasn't gotten a good 
    night's sleep in five years. The films starts out as pretty bloody 
    and gory, as Camryn watches all her friends be killed by The Hunter 
    in various ways (Camryn is even impaled in the shoulder by one of the 
    killer's booby traps when she tries to save a girl who is tied up), 
    but then the film changes to how Camryn is coping as a person, waking 
    up in a constant sweat and even believes she sees The Hunter chasing 
    her as she is alone, closing up shop for the night. The cops are 
    called to the scene and can find nothing, so co-worker Nick (Brian 
    Villalobos, Akasha's real-life husband) offers to let her stay on the 
    couch at his place, which is populated by some of the most 
    self-loathing &quot;artists&quot; in a horror movie. Real, but 
    obscenely pitiful.&nbsp; It is plain to see Nick wants to be her 
    boyfriend, but Camryn is just too much into The Hunter trying to kill 
    her. The film asks us this very important question: Is Camryn 
    actually psychotic and seeing The Hunter all in her mind (early 
    scenes indicate that) or is this a set up for another massacre? In 
    either case, will Camryn survive this one? This is a very well done 
    psycho-thriller, with part slasher, part giallo, part thriller, part 
    drama and one one hell of a bloody conclusion. Director/Screenwriter 
    Benjamin R. Moody (his first feature film) uses all the usual horror 
    tropes to fashion a film that keeps you guessing, such as when&nbsp; 
    Camryn and Danielle (Danielle Evon Ploeger), go to the site of the 
    original massacre so Camryn can face her fears and get some 
    &quot;closure&quot;. You think you may know what is going to happen, 
    but you would be wrong, especially when they dig up the grave of The 
    Hunter. I'm not saying anything else about the film, except to watch 
    it if you want to see a horror film done right. And you don't see it 
    that often. Intelligent and involving.&nbsp;Be aware that the title 
    has two meanings.; <B><A HREF="blood_father_2015.htm">BLOOD FATHER</A></B> 
    (2015) can be considered Mel Gibson's return to serious acting after 
    being exiled for getting caught driving drunk and putting down Jews 
    about 10 years ago. A lot of Americans refused to watch him in any 
    movie, while the rest of the world was wondering &quot;What's the big 
    deal?&quot; I'm with the rest of the world on this and can only say, 
    &quot;C'mon sugar tits, give the man a break. We all get drunk once 
    in a while and from that drunkeness comes the truth. So he doesn't 
    like Jews. Blame his Nazi-loving father for that.&quot; This film, on 
    the other hand, proves why Mel Gibson was such a big draw in the 80's 
    &amp; 90's and winning two Academy Awards&reg; in the process. Here, 
    Gibson plays the thick-bearded Link, a former alcoholic and life-long 
    criminal and ex-con who is trying to go straight. He lives in a 
    scummy trailer park in the middle of the New Mexico desert (filmed on 
    location) and with his sober companion and friend Kirby (a 
    fantastically funny William H. Macy, who tells Link the difference 
    between &quot;fitting&quot; and &quot;proper&quot; that will have you 
    laughing tears), just trying to survive and stay sober. His estranged 
    daughter, Lydia (Erin Moriarty), is in deep shit, though. She is a 
    junkie and hold-up thief who just shot her boyfriend Jonah (Diego 
    Luna) in the neck in what was a total accident (Jonah gives her a 
    nose-full of chemical courage to help him and his gang out, which 
    just makes her more nervous), but Jonah and his gang are on her trail 
    to kill her. She calls her Daddy and he picks her up. They have many 
    absent father/daughter fights (he throws away all her dope, takes 
    away her .45 pistol and tries to dry her out, only to learn she has 
    more dope hidden in her clarinet), until Jonah's dope dealing friends 
    find Link's trailer, shoot it to pieces and then ram it with their 
    pickup truck, overturning it on its side. If not for Kirby and the 
    rest of the trailer park residents defending Link and his daughter, 
    they most certainly would be be dead. The father-daughter team leave 
    before the police arrive and meet a nice young motel clerk (Thomas 
    Mann) who gives them the key to the only room (where Link shaves off 
    his beard) with a backdoor when the police arrive (They are 
    shotgunned to death by Jonah's gang). Link steals a car and they 
    barely get away frim a shotgun-firing gang member. Link then goes to 
    former inmate Preacher (a wonderful Michael Parks; <B><A HREF="planet_terror_2007.htm">PLANET
     TERROR</A></B> - 2007), a White Supremacist Nazi Leader who Link 
    helped in the Joint, but hated what he stood for. He ends up giving 
    Preacher and his wife Cherise (Dale Dickey; <B><A HREF="possession_of_michael_king_2013.htm">THE
     POSSESSION OF MICHAEL KING</A></B> - 2013) a beat-down and then 
    steals Preacher's custom cherry Harley Davidson. Link and Lydia head 
    out on the highway, with many obstacles in their way. I'll leave the 
    rest for you to discover, but seeing Gibson on a motorcycle instantly 
    brings back memories of <B><A HREF="mad_max_1979.htm">MAD MAX</A></B> 
    (1979) and <B><A HREF="road_warrior_1982.htm">THE ROAD WARRIOR</A></B> 
    (1981) and makes you think that Mel Gibson could have pulled off the 
    latest film <B><A HREF="mad_max_fury_road_2015.htm">MAD MAX: FURY ROAD</A></B> 
    (2015), but his blacklisting (which has since been lifted) stopped 
    him from doing it. Director Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Richet&nbsp; (the <B><A HREF="assault_on_precinct_13_2005.htm">ASSAULT
     ON PRECINCT 13</A></B> [2005] remake) keeps the film under 90 
    minutes and there's hardly any unneeded dialogue or exposition to 
    bore you. There is, however, plenty of graphic violence to keep you 
    occupied with your eyes on the screen and Mel Gibson proves he still 
    has it. I am not going to try to change anyone's mind about their 
    feelings about him, because what he said when he was drunk was 
    hurtful to some people (Right, sugar tits? A female cop that takes 
    offense to that phrase needs to toughen-up and Jews have a right to 
    dislike him, but we should be able to separate the art from the 
    artist. Just look at Roman Polanski and Victor Salva, who both have 
    done much, much worse things.), but I found this film to be a delight 
    and have an ending that fits the film perfectly. Recommended.; <B><A HREF="hardcore_henry_2015.htm">HARDCORE
     HENRY</A></B> (2015) is an indescribable action film told 
    exclusively from&nbsp; Henry's eyes. No, this isn't a found footage

    have shot entire films from one person's POV. The first one I can 
    think of is 1947's <B><A HREF="lady_in_the_lake_1947.htm">LADY IN THE LAKE</A></B>,

     a graphic horror film that is also a great watch. While it is hard 
    to understand 90% of what is going on in this film, 
    director/screenwriter Ilya Naishuller wows the viewer with some 
    extreme chases, one-of-a-kind visuals and some extreme violence that 
    goes way past the film's R-Rating (this seems to be the original 
    uncut version, since Showtime is airing it under its original title <B><A HREF="hardcore_2015.htm">HARDCORE</A></B>).
     I would love to tell you more (Sharlto Copely, who plays Jimmy [and 
    has more costume changes than Cher at a concert], has gone on record 
    that this was the most difficult film he has ever made and he has 
    made some very demanding films, and over 10 people, including the 
    director, played Henry. Why 10 people? Because the special camera 
    getup, entirely shot using GoPro Hero3 Black Edition cameras, was too 
    heavy for one person to wear every day and some had to be rushed to 
    hospitals to fix their severe neck pain, but hardly any stunt men 
    were hurt, which is hard to believe. The worst injury was a chipped 
    tooth.), but I would be lying to you if I tried to explain it. Henry 
    is part cyborg (in the beginning, he watches as his missing left arm 
    and leg are replaced in seconds by some new-fangled machine). There 
    is a long blonde-haired man named Akan (Danila Kozlovsky), who is super-telekinetic
     and wants to kill Henry for reasons unclear (It is also unclear how 
    he became super-telekinetic, so people who love this film made a 
    comic book and fan-film on how he achieved such powers) who turns out 
    to be someone Henry once knew and if his wife Estelle (Haley Bennett) 
    is actually his wife. Henry makes that decision on that in the final 
    frames of the film before the end credits appear. During the final 
    credits there is an audible clue by Jimmy that there may be a sequel

    genetic code for reasons made clear towards the end of the film. 
    That's really all I can say without giving the plot away, except that 
    Chiklis loves to rub his face on Renee's cheek and if you are scared 
    of spiders, this is not the film for you. Director/Producer Steven 
    Shainberg (Who directed the acclaimed film <B><A HREF="secretary_2002.htm">SECRETARY</A></B> 
    - 2002) keeps you guessing all the way, thanks to Brian Nelson's 
    intelligent screenplay, where people must face their worst fears and 
    take injections daily. Renee is also an intelligent person and she 
    manages to break her shackles and crawl through the building's heat 
    ducts, where she sees sights like you have never seen before. You 
    want to be shocked and surprised? Then this is the movie for you. You 
    will never guess the final scene's stinger.; <B><A HREF="lavalantula_2015.htm">LAVALANTULA</A></B> 
    (2015) is one of the most fun SyFy Original Films in quite a while 
    and it is all thanks to Steve Guttenberg (<B><A HREF="police_academy_7_film_collection_1984-1989.htm">POLICE
     ACADEMY 1 to 4</A></B> - 1984 - 1987) and funny 
    direction/co-screenwriting by Mike Mendez (<B><A HREF="dont_kill_it_2016.htm">DON'T
     KILL IT</A></B> - 2016). The film opens with Colton West 
    (Guttenberg), who was once a popular action film hero called The Red 
    Rocket in the '90s and has fallen on hard times, filming a scene in a 
    B-film where he is repeatedly punched in the face by the right hand 
    man of a film baddie (a cameo by Carlos Bernard of TV's <B><A HREF="24_tv_series.htm">24</A></B> 
    fame) who is interrogating him about something he wants (It's a 
    pretty funny take-off on <B><A HREF="lethal_weapon_1987.htm">LETHAL WEAPON</A></B>).
     The special effects smoke goes wrong by the effects crew (Played by <B><A HREF="police_academy_1984.htm">POLICE
     ACADEMY</A></B> [1984] alumni Michael Winslow and Marion Ramsey) 
    ruining the scene and Colton learns that they no longer use smoke 
    like they did in his Red Rocket films. Now they use liquid nitrogen 
    (Are you kidding me? But it plays an important part in the finale.). 
    When Colton learns that this is a giant cockroach film, he walks off 
    the set, saying &quot;I don't like bugs&quot; and the director says 
    he will never make another film again because he's washed-up. 
    Colton's Agent Arni (the diminutive Danny Woodburn, who is a hoot in 
    his short scenes [no pun intended]) learns that his client walked off 
    the film and rips Colton a new asshole. Colton was just bailed out of 
    jail by Arni the night before for getting into a fight (turns out he 
    stepped in the middle of a fight trying to stop it) which makes the 
    entertainment news report on TV which his wife Olivia (Nia Peeples, 
    who is not only a great looking woman, but you'll be staring at her 
    ample bosom because of what she is wearing.) sees it and knows that 
    Colton is just trying to keep his name popular. He promised his son 
    Wyatt (Noah Hunt) he would take him to a Dodgers game, but he gets 
    stuck in notorious L.A. traffic, where he sees a mountain in Santa 
    Monica explode like a volcano and fire-spewing spiders appear and 
    beging killing all the people on the highway (The CGI is pretty good 
    for a SyFy film). Wyatt is tired of waiting for his father, so he 
    takes off on his BMX bicycle to be with some friends, unaware of the 
    killer spiders. Colt gets off the highway with his SUV and makes it 
    home, telling Olivia to pack her bags because of killer spiders 
    coming out of a volcano. Olivia doesn't believe him and thinks it was 
    just another aftershock from an earthquake. Colton takes off with a 
    shotgun to find Wyatt, who is trapped in a building with three of his 
    friends with fire breathing spiders killing one friend and one of the 
    spiders bites Jordan (Diana Hopper). Colton's SUV has it's tires 
    blown by the hot road (There are lava tunnels underground throughout 
    L.A. and he also melts his sneakers), so he hijacks a Hollywood tour 
    bus where super Red Rocket fan Chris (Patrick Renna; <B><A HREF="dark_ride_2006.htm">DARK
     RIDE</A></B> - 2006, but best remembered for his role as 
    &quot;Ham&quot; in <B><A HREF="sandlot_1993.htm">THE SANDLOT</A></B> 
    - 1993) helps Colton get rid of the spiders that have jumped on the 
    bus (this scene is not only well done, it is funny as hell). Olivia 
    calls neighbor Doris (<B><A HREF="police_academy_3_1986.htm">POLICE 
    ACADEMY 3</A></B>'s [1986] Leslie Easterbrook) and hears Doris get 
    her face burned off by a spider. (This film, even though funny, 
    doesn't hold back the grue). Olivia runs over to Doris' house and 
    sees her with no face and is nearly burned to death by a spider. 
    Realizing what Colton told her was true, she goes back to her home 
    and does her best impression of Rambo before being rescued by the 
    military. This is only the first half of the film, which contains 
    some laugh-out-loud scenes, like the spiders killing a man in a 
    spider costume, small spiders coming out of Jordan's mouth and 
    burning off her head, while Wyatt's only other friend is set on fire 
    by the small spiders. Wyatt grabs a fire extinguisher and learns that 
    it kills the spiders. Colton, Olivia and Wyatt are reunited, but 
    learn from a map made by Dr. Eric Von Struble (Time Winters) in a 
    museum where the lava tunnels are. Another funny scene is when Colton 
    runs into Fin Shepard (Ian Ziering), proving that this film is in the 
    same universe as <B><A HREF="sharknado_2013.htm">SHARKNADO</A></B> 
    (2013 - 2017), even though it wasn't made by The Asylum (it's a 
    CineTel Production). There are spoofs of many films here, such as <B><A HREF="raiders_of_the_lost_ark_1981.htm">RAIDERS
     OF THE LOST ARK</A></B> (1981; you'll know it when you see it), <B><A HREF="spider_man_2002.htm">SPIDER-MAN</A></B> 
    (2002) and especially <B><A HREF="rocketeer_1991.htm">THE ROCKETEER</A></B> 
    (1991) during the finale. Steve Guttenberg looks like he is having a 
    ball making fun of his image as a washed-up action 
    hero-turned-real-life action hero and he is quite good portraying a 
    former action star (a la Steven Seagal) who now only makes DTV films. 
    (He makes a funny VHS cover artwork reference early in the film). The 
    special effects are above par for a SyFy film and the fire gags are 
    very well done. Michael Winslow does his patented vocal noises and 
    made me laugh when he was imitating the dubbing of a Japanese monster 
    film. You could see Guttenberg trying not to laugh as he is driving 
    while Winslow does his voice schtick. All around this film is worth 
    your time, as is the sequel <B><A HREF="2_lava_2_lantula_2016.htm">2 
    LAVA 2 LANTULA!</A></B> (2016; not directed by Mendez), also starring

    (2015; renamed <B><A HREF="cursed_to_kill_2015.htm">CURSED TO KILL</A></B> 
    for its cable TV showings) is one of the scariest horror films I have 
    seen in quite a while. The fact that 95% of the film takes place in a 
    single bed hospital room tells you that storytelling is the main 
    ingredient here. The film opens with a female getting seriously 
    wounded by being shot in a living room of a house. We then see a 
    bunch of shadowy hands and arms coming down from the ceiling and 
    reaching for her. This entire sequence is scary as hell (even though 
    we don't know what is going on) and the entire scene is shown as a 
    reflection on an old TV screen! We then find out who the woman is. 
    Her name is Rachel (Anney Reese) and she is a paraplegic because the 
    bullet hit her spine. She was escaping a cult (she has a circle with 
    three verticle lines passing through it branded on the back of her 
    neck, or as <A HREF="cursed_to_kill_2015.htm"><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/patient aka cursed to kill poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="174" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>a
     voice says, &quot;A cord of three strands is not easily 
    broken.&quot;) who were perfoming a mass suicide (we briefly see a 
    story headline in a newspaper on Rachel's hospital room desk and it 
    is remarkably like the real-life Heaven's Gate mass suicide in 1997, 
    but there is little to no religion mentioned in this film) and was 
    shot for doing so. Every once in a while Rachel is visited by an ugly 
    hag (Kate Thompson) who only she can see. She talks in a voice that 
    sounds like a possessed Linda Blair in <B><A HREF="exorcist.htm">THE EXORCIST</A></B> 
    (1973) and wants Rachel&nbsp; to offer up the soul of her young 
    nephew in exchange for hers. Rachel refuses, so the old hag curses 
    her, saying every time Rachel speaks or makes a sound, anyone who 
    hears her voice will die horribly. She quickly discovers that is true 
    because when her co-worker, Marty (Nicholas Ryan Izzo), a real 
    scumbag, comes to visit her and tries to rape her in her hospital bed 
    (He says, &quot;You probably won't even feel this!&quot;). she speaks 
    and his arms and legs break (we hear the breaking of bone and 
    twisting of muscle) and he dissolves into ash, which travels up into 
    the ceiling. Rachel knows when the hag is coming because there is a 
    black stain on the ceiling that grows bigger and bigger and only she 
    can see it. She is visited by her estranged short-tempered brother 
    Jesse (co-screenwriter Brett Brooks) and his young son Alex (Chase 
    Wainscott), the little boy whose soul the hag and her coven want. She 
    refuses to talk to him and Jesse doesn't understand why (Rachel shows 
    him why by putting headphones on Jesse so he can't hear her and has 
    him put a suffering mouse caught in a trap on her bed. She speaks and 
    the mouse explodes, its remains traveling up to the ceiling). Jesse 
    is horrified, but now he knows why she doesn't speak. Every once in a 
    while, spirits come to Rachel (including her dead mother) and leave 
    her with a white homemade doll (which looks like a voodoo doll), that 
    has an item stuffed into it. These are clues as to where to find the 
    three cult members who are out to get her. When they were children, 
    Rachel and Jesse had their own private secret code that they would 
    write to each other, so Rachel writes a long note in the code to 
    Jesse and records her voice on a cassette tape recorder when no one 
    is in the room. Jesse takes the note, the cassette recorder and the 
    items in the doll home and decodes the note. He finds out that the 
    items inside the doll (A room key keychain with a motel room number 
    on it; a bottlecap from a drink that is no longer available and a 
    matchbook with three unused matches inside) will lead him to the 
    cultists who are after Rachel. Jesse puts on the headphones and goes 
    to the three places where he can find the cultists and plays the 
    tape. As soon as they hear Rachel's voice, they dissolve and the 
    remains rise upward. After killing the first two, he discovers the 
    third cultist is Rachel's doctor, Dr. Kaufmann (Thomas Kirkland), who 
    performed an unnessary spinal tap on her with no anesthesia that 
    Jesse witnessed (it put Rachel in so much pain that she nearly 
    screamed, but she managed to suffer through the pain in silence), so 
    rather than playing the tape, he puts a bullet in Dr. Kaufmann's 
    head. This defeats the old hag as the demonic cultists turn against 
    her for failing to do her job and she disappears (Alex can now see 
    her, too). In the finale, Jesse asks Rachel if it is all over and 
    Rachel opens her mouth to speak and the screen goes black, the 
    closing credits then play. I usually hate films with limited 
    locations, but the feeling of claustrophobia permeates this film and 
    director/co-screenwriter Jason Sheedy (his first full-length feature) 
    uses it to the film's advantage. I haven't even touched on some of 
    the film's finer points, such as the fate of Rachel's personal nurse, 
    Mary-Katherine (Sheri Gilbert-Wilson) and other distinctive touches 
    (An earlier draft of the script revealed that Alex was deaf!), but if 
    this film doesn't raise the hairs on the back of your neck or give 
    you goosebumps, you really can't consider yourself a horror fanatic. 
    I give this film my ultimate highest recommendation. I haven't been 
    scared by a film in a long time. Made with imagination and very 
    little money, the way it should be. While this film has very little 
    blood or gore, there is still an &quot;ick&quot; factor to some of 
    the scenes, such as the black stain on the ceiling pouring gooey 
    black liquid into Rachel's mouth while the hag forces her mouth open 
    and various quick clips of people dying when Rachel speaks. Released 
    on DVD by <A HREF="http://www.mtivideo.com">MTI Home Video</A> under 
    its original title and shown on cable station Showtime under the 
    renamed title. Either way you see it, this film is a winner. <B>Not Rated</B>

     a partial list<A NAME="Bad1997-2000"></A> of films that I have 
    watched on DTV that are not worth your time: <B><A HREF="back_in_business_1997.htm">BACK
     IN BUSINESS</A></B> (1997) is the kind of action &quot;buddy&quot; 
    film that nearly destroyed Brian Bosworth's movie career (He redeemed 
    himself somewhat in <B><A HREF="operative_2000.htm">THE OPERATIVE</A></B> 
    - 2000). In this film he teams up with Joe Torry and their chemistry 
    couldn't be much worse than Adolph Hitler trying to make friends with 
    a Jew. The story is about ex-cop Bosworth getting caught-up in a plot 
    with ex-partner Torry to catch drug runners and dirty cops for the 
    FBI. The dialogue and action scenes all seem forced and unbelievable. 
    The person I really feel sorry for here is the late Brion James as 
    the lead bad guy. He deserved so much better than this; <B><A HREF="time_under_fire_1997.htm">TIME
     UNDER FIRE</A></B> (1997) is so bad, I nearly turned it off halfway 
    through (and I never do that). It's one of those Andrew Stevens/Ashok 
    Amritraj productions which &quot;borrows&quot; film footage from 
    other movies to keep costs down. This one concerns a submarine 
    captain (Jeff Fahey, who looks like he knows this film is a stinker) 
    whose sub passes through a rip in time and they end up in a future 
    Earth where the entire planet is run with a iron fist by...his own 
    grandson (what are the chances?). It's straight downhill from there, 
    as Fahey joins forces with rebels (there are always rebels) to bring 
    down his own grandson (also played by Fahey). Shown on TV under the 
    title <B><A HREF="beneath_the_bermuda_triangle_1997.htm">BENEATH THE

     OF TERROR</A></B> (1997). I'm not the biggest fan of anthology films 
    (my favorite will always be the original <B><A HREF="tales_from_the_crypt_1972.htm">TALES
     FROM THE CRYPT</A></B> - 1972, mainly due to the Peter Cushing 
    episode, because he lost his beloved real-life wife just before 
    production and you can see the loss in his acting and face, which 
    adds poignancy to the tale) and this film is one of the reasons why. 
    There are three tales in this Canadian production, all directed by 
    Douglas Jackson (<B><A HREF="whispers_1989.htm">WHISPERS</A></B> - 
    1989), and besides the third tale, which contains Jennifer Rubin and 
    a couple of creepy guys, it's pretty slow going. The film is 
    &quot;hosted&quot; by an agoraphobic crazy guy named Philip (Joseph 
    Ziegler), who bridges the three tales together and makes you want to 
    strangle him with his over-acting; <B><A HREF="razor_blade_smile_1998.htm">RAZOR
     BLADE SMILE</A></B> (1998) is a shining example of excessive style 
    over substance. Eileen Daly (who is easy on the eyes, but can't act a 
    lick) stars as a centuries-old vampire who hires herself out as a 
    hitwoman. She is hired to take out the businessmen who are part of a 
    secret group known as &quot;The Illuminati&quot;, whose leader is the 
    man who turned her into a vampire. That's basically the whole story, 
    except director Jake West (who redeemeed himself somewhat with the 
    funny horror comedy <B><A HREF="doghouse_2009.htm">DOGHOUSE</A></B> - 
    2009) uses quick editing cuts and every camera trick in the book. 
    You'll end up reaching for the Tylenol long before the film ends, if 
    you make it that far; I really wanted to like <B><A HREF="blood_money_1998.htm">BLOOD
     MONEY</A></B> (1998) because it is the only film directed by Michael 
    Ironside (<B><A HREF="scanners_1981.htm">SCANNERS</A></B> - 1980), 
    but truth be told, it is nothing but the same old cop thriller you've 
    seen done a dozen times before. Ironside also stars as Detective Jack 
    Connor who, along with his partner Detective Leper (Currie Graham), 
    must protect a stripper named Candy (an aggravating Lori Petty), who 
    witnessed a Mob drug deal gone wrong. Now the Mob wants her dead 
    before she testifies in court. It's the same old, same old, as Candy 
    (who proves her stripper mentality by disrobing in front of a priest, 
    Father Kirby, played by Bill Dow) survives one gunfight after another 
    while slowly falling in love with Detective Leper. There's nothing in 
    Ironside's script (this was the last of two screenplays he wrote so 
    far) that is new (including the religious subtext), so there's really 
    no reason to watch it. It is shown on pay cable under the title <B>DEADLY
     ARRANGEMENT</B> because there are about a dozen films with the 
    original title; <B><A HREF="armstrong_1998.htm">ARMSTRONG</A></B> 
    (1998) would be a lot more relevant if it was made in the mid-80's 
    rather than 1998, but it should come as no surprise that it was 
    directed/produced/written by former Cannon Pictures co-founder 
    Menahem Golan (who also puts in a cameo here as the Russian 
    president). Rod Armstrong (Frank Zagarino) is a former SEAL who now 
    lives in Russia teaching military training. His former commanding 
    officer Robert (the late Charles Napier) and his SEAL wife Susan 
    (Kimberley Kates) pay Robert a visit and tell him that Russian 
    nuclear missiles are being sold on the black market. When Robert is 
    murdered, Rod and Susan go after the leaders, Ponytail (Joe Lara) and 
    Russian General Zukov (the late Richard Lynch), raiding their highly 
    guarded fortress and putting an end to the nuclear madness. This is 
    really a slow paced actioner with badly choreographed fighting 
    scenes; <B><A HREF="freedom_strike_1998.htm">FREEDOM STRIKE</A></B> 
    (1998) is another one of producer Andrew Steven's Royal Oaks 
    Entertainment production company's cost-cutting action films that 
    &quot;borrows&quot; action footage from A-list films. This one 
    contains mucho jet footage from <B><A HREF="top_gun_1986.htm">TOP GUN</A></B> 
    (1986) and aircraft carrier footage from <B><A HREF="steel_sharks_1997.htm">STEEL
     SHARKS</A></B> (1997). The plot concerns the titled anti-terrorist 
    group (led by Michael Dudikoff) trying to find the terrorists 
    responsible for shooting the Syrian President with an undetonated 
    explosive bullet at a peace conference on an aircraft carrier. The 
    producers added some pre-credits text at the beginning of the film to 
    make it seem this film was made post-9/11 (due to the terrorist 
    plot), yet they forgot to remove the 1998 production credit during 
    the end credits; <B><A HREF="postmortem_1998.htm">POSTMORTEM</A></B>

    (who, in a bid for respectability, bills himself as &quot;Charles

    nice to look at, but this thriller about an alcoholic American cop

    to Glasgow to discover his roots, only to get involved in a serial 
    killer case, is about as interesting as bark on a tree. It is one of 
    Pyun's better films, but that's not saying much; <B><A HREF="fallout_1999.htm">FALLOUT</A></B> 
    (1999) would have made more sense during the Reagan Presidency, but 
    to come out the year the 90's ended seems just foolish. Frank 
    Zagarino is a Russian cosmonaut who takes over a NASA space station 
    and threatens to point nuclear missiles at strategic sites on Earth. 
    Daniel Baldwin is the disgraced NASA pilot sent to the space station 
    to stop him. Since this DTV release was rated PG-13, don't expect 
    much bloody violence or nudity. Just boredom; <B><A HREF="lovers_lane_2000.htm">LOVERS

    (1999) was one of those low-budget genre films made by the UPN 
    Network in the late-90's to early-00's to compete with the Sci Fi 
    Network. This one is an Australian sci fi tale about the surface of 
    the Earth being unliveable because the volcanic activity caused by 
    too many nuclear tests has sucked the oxygen out of the air. The 
    people are forced to live underground in airtight tunnels and are 
    policed by the ironically titled &quot;Air Force&quot;, who search 
    for more air-filled tunnels. It looks like the entire film was lensed

    state's evidence against the mob. Something much different happens, 
    though. Not much else happens in this movie and its only legacy is 
    that it was the film that Van Dien and Oxenberg would fall in love in 
    real life and eventually get married. You can actually see their 
    newfound affection for each other on-screen; <B><A HREF="fortress_2_re-entry_1999.htm">FORTRESS

    bunch of odd characters and plans an escape, but dastardly warden 
    Peter Teller (Patrick Malahide) has other plans. Even an extended

    When Grannie is put in a hospital by some street thugs, the rap star 
    uses his grandmother's magic to put a killing spell in a regular 
    ragdoll. The doll goes around killing the thugs, but the rap star

    the digital video camera at the time). The fact that J.R. Bookwalter

    believe that dozens of people wronged her, so she has quite the case

    his latest nuclear missile satellite. When a police detective (Dondre

    every now and then. She was 45 years-old when she made this film and 
    it's obvious that she uses a stunt double for some of the more 
    strenuous scenes (something she never did back in Hong Kong). Forget 
    the plot of this film (Rothrock is a wanted secret agent trying to 
    right a government wrong) and try to enjoy the brief fighting scenes. 
    Even the finale, where Rothrock fights main bad guy James Lew is way 
    too short. Hell, the movie co-stars Jeff Wincott, who is a decent

    (2002) is another natural disaster film perfect for SyFy. A comet 
    passes close to Earth causing a massive superstorm in the Atlantic 
    Ocean with 600mph winds that will hit the eastern shore of the United 
    States in less than 24 hours, killing nearly everyone and causing 
    mass destruction. Scientist Dale Midkiff (<B><A HREF="pet_sematary_1989.htm">PET

    the storm, but he and a bunch of scientists must fly a new

    General Michael Ironside (<B><A HREF="scanners_1981.htm">SCANNERS</A></B>

    in the mission exterminated because the plane and the instrument 
    aren't supposed to exist. Nothing special here, but at least they

    imagines a teenage Holmes (a miscast James D'Arcy) and Dr. Watson 
    (Roger Morlidge) battling enemy Professor Moriarity (Vincent 
    D'Onofrio) from grabbing the heroin trade in London. There's not much

    atrocity (it was not shot in 35mm as the IMDB reports) is about a 
    dying wife traveling with her husband to the titled area, a hotbed of 
    UFO activity, in hopes of finding out from aliens if there is life 
    after death. At least Shatner (who mainly has nothing but an extended 
    cameo here) hired excellent cinematographer Mac Ahlberg to shoot the 
    film, but you can tell right away that it is digital video (this was 
    2002, afterall) and the story, based on an idea by Shatner, is about 
    as boring a film can be without curing your insomnia. Does the wife

    stars as &quot;Beans&quot;, as in &quot;I don't give a hill

    worth every death and dollar; <B><A HREF="riverworld_2002.htm">RIVERWORLD</A></B> 
    (2002). The Sci-Fi Network took author Philip Jose Farmer's series of 
    &quot;Riverworld&quot; novels and made a film so boring, a snail 
    seemed like Speed Racer. The premise of the novels and this film is 
    that when you die on Earth, you are reincarnated, but instead of your 
    soul being sent to Heaven, your body is sent to the planet Riverworld 
    (which looks a lot like New Zealand, where this movie was filmed), 
    where warring factions of reincarnates fight it out for no other 
    reason than to fight it out. Astronaut Jeff Hale (Brad Johnson) dies 
    and is sent to the planet, where he and a ragtag group of people 
    (including Mark Twain, played by Cameron Daddo, and an alien, who had 
    the misfortune of dying on Earth) fight to go down river in a ship to 
    one of the only safe places on the planet. I guess the point of this 
    film is not to die, because what is on the other side is a hundred 
    times worse than what you have here. The storyline of the film is 
    sound, but it could have been so much more fun if it had more famous 
    real-life dead people from all the centuries in it (Nero does make a 
    cameo here). The Sci-Fi Network, who changed their name to SyFy, 
    tried to make up for their sins in 2010 and make a <A HREF="riverworld_2010.htm">four
     hour miniseries</A> (with commercials) of the same story. It's twice 
    as long as the first film and twice as boring; <B><A HREF="do_or_die_2003.htm">DO

    that the meteorite contained alien &quot;seeds&quot; and when they 
    hatch they look just like...moths! Two scientists (Nicholas Lea and 
    Jamie Luner) are given 48 hours to contain and find a cure for this

    acting talents of rap artist Treach, who is the star of the film. I

    mistake. What follows next is very predictable, as a mysterious woman

    fade-to-black for commercial breaks, though). It's a sub-standard 
    thriller about a shark attacking people in the waters of Black Cove, 
    Louisiana and screwing with Lou Diamond Phillip's nearly-bankrupt 
    charter boat business. More rap star stunt casting (this time it is 
    Coolio) has a sub-plot involving a cashe of stolen loot buried 
    underwated near an oil well. The shark footage is fine (especially

    States when Miramax and the Weinstein Brothers had financial 
    troubles. It was uncerimoniously dumped on DVD and cable in 2007 with 
    ten minutes excised (A Weinstein trademark; only the Germans seem to 
    have the uncut version). In this case, the wait was warranted. This 
    is a lousy supernatural/horror flick starring the large-foreheaded 
    Christina Ricci as an American visiting the Isle Of Man, who gets hit 
    by a car and is knocked unconscious. When she wakes up, she is at the 
    house of a seemingly nice woman (Kerry Fox) in some small town. She 
    begins to have religious visions and prophecies and uncovers a deadly 
    secret the town is hiding. Besides a tense moment dealing with a

    is a psycho who had been stalking Reid for years and he plans on

    The End. Don't waste your time. I have just told you the entire film 
    in a couple of sentences. The biggest &quot;WTF?!?&quot; moment comes 
    when Tara first escapes and throws her cell phone against a tree,

    to test a new solution that could revolutionize cleaning up oil 
    spills. What it does instead is create a monster that begins killing

    possession of the package. For some reason, there was even a sequel 
    made, <B><A HREF="black_dawn_2005.htm">BLACK DAWN</A></B> (2005),

     OF THE BEAST</A></B> (2003). Seagal plays his usual ex-CIA 
    operative, this time named Jake Hopper, who now runs a successful

    girl named Sarah (who is the daughter of a U.S. senator) are 
    kidnapped in Thailand by an Islamic terrorist, who demands the 
    release of 20 prisoners in American custody, Jake travels to Thailand 
    to save his daughter, who is the weak link in the kidnapping and will 
    probably be the first to die. The biggest surprise of this dull film 
    is that it was made by Ching Siu-Tung, a Hong Kong-based director who 
    gave us the vastly superior <B><A HREF="chinese_ghost_story_1987.htm">A
     CHINESE GHOST STORY</A></B> (1987). Apparently, something got lost

    pretty good fight scenes, the rest of the film is flat as dishwater; <B><A HREF="consequence_2003.htm">CONSEQUENCE</A></B>

    dollars, so he fakes his own death, has some plastic surgery and 
    takes over his dead brother's life. Unfortunately, his dead brother 
    wasn't as clean as he thought and Assante is pursued by thugs, nosey 
    neighbors and his late brother's girlfriend, who notices the 
    differences (especially in bed). The plot may be good, but director 
    Anthony Hickox's (<B><A HREF="waxwork_1988.htm">WAXWORK</A></B> -

     BREED: THE LEGEND OF SAMHAIN</A></B> (2003) is a mess of a film

    many of the gore scenes removed). &quot;Star&quot; Richard Grieco's 
    role was reduced to a small cameo (his fight with a mutant was 
    totally removed) and the film is nothing more than a stalk 'n' slash

    still plenty of gore, but the film makes absolutely no sense at all.

    much better in a lot of cases, with Rutten not only battling the bad

    going through 'roid rage. There are very few surprises in store and 
    the film just meanders along with a gunfight and explosion or two,

    a major brawl, it is always cut short by the last remaining survivor

    the help of reluctant Breckin Meyer) until it is just a showdown 
    between him and Jones (who is holding Griffin's son hostage). In real

    films. A veterinary doctor (Vincent Ventresca) is called in to check

    full of hungry growing parasites. Since the farmer has also 
    slaughtered some of his cows and sold their meat, the parasites grow

    effects man Scott Coulter and a stupid plot (this was all done on 
    purpose to sell more feed to the farmers by bad guy David Selby) 
    makes this no better or worse than 98% of Sci Fi's flicks. That's not 
    saying much; <B><A HREF="demon_hunter_2005.htm">DEMON HUNTER</A></B> 
    (2004) is an unbelievably bad horror flick that has dialogue so 
    stilted, you may need a ladder to get over it. Sean Patrick Flanery 
    portrays Jake Greyman, the &quot;half breed&quot; (part demon, part 
    human) titled character, who thinks exorcisms are unnecessary and 
    kills the ones who are possessed. He does this all with the sanction 
    of Cardinal White (William Bassett) and the Church, as the demon 
    Asmodeus (a wasted Billy Drago) tries to impregnate several women who 
    he hopes will spawn him a son. Jake is tormented by a succubus (Tania 
    Deighton, who sports the fakest-looking horns this side of a grade 
    school play) and saddled with Sister Sarah Ryan (Colleen Porch) as a 
    sidekick (she is more than she lets on to be). It all plays like some 
    TV Movie, with added gore, foul language, topless nudity and out-of-place
     heavy metal music, probably because it was produced none other than 
    the late Stephen J. Cannell, king of TV action series. There are also 
    fights that try to emulate those seen in Hong Kong actioners (lots of 
    wire work and plenty of twirling bodies as they fall to the ground) 
    and really bad dialogue that has to be heard to be believed. Director 
    Scott Ziehl (who made the much better <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#ExitSpeed">EXIT
     SPEED</A></B> in 2008) offers nothing in the way of horror or

    characters from his previous films, but he was given an honorary 
    &quot;Executive Producer&quot; credit even though he was in no way 
    involved in this film. The plot is junk, as Anton Toulon's 
    great-nephew Robert (Feldman) plans to stop Erica Sharpe (Angel) from 
    injecting the Demonic Toys with the same serum as the puppets (who 
    are now the good guys), giving them out as toys to the world's

    ex-CIA agent turned survivalist, who gets involved with fighting a 
    white slavery ring when the girl he is sponsoring in a foster program

    Casper Van Dien) are attacked by the skeletal remains of a ghostly 
    Indian named Cotton Mouth Joe, who rides a ghost horse and 
    decapitates his victims with a sword. Halfway through the film, the 
    plot changes and it seems like a different film was tacked-on to 
    finish the movie. It's like the Sci Fi Channel gave a big &quot;FUCK 
    YOU!&quot; to all their viewers who complain about the quality of 
    their movies. It seems they set out to prove (with assistance from 
    frequent Cirio H. Santiago screenwriter Frederick Bailey) that they

    (2005), a horrible slasher film without one likable character, 
    especially Kathryn Taylor as Tara, who will have you wishing that El 
    Charro (voiced by Danny Trejo and portrayed by Andrew Bryniarski) 
    would make her his first victim because of her extreme bitch 
    behavior. Too bad she doesn't bite it until the film is 
    three-quarters over. The only &quot;What The Fuck?!?&quot; moment is 
    when the bitchy girls enter a bar and proceed to watch the weirdest 
    musical act in film history: a man in a wheelchair who sings a 
    quasi-heavy metal song about killing himself. Otherwise, this film is 
    the usual bloody slasher film without one likeable character, even 
    the girl with the mental problems who has visions of El Charro out to 
    get her. She is so depressing, you'll be reaching for the razor

    also eats their flesh (This is the kind of film where Andre has an

     MARKSMAN</A></B> (2005) is one of those paint-by-numbers, 
    filmed-in-Romania, action flicks that could easily star any 
    downtrodden action star. This time it's Wesley Snipes as a 
    &quot;Painter&quot;, an expert at killing and rescuing people, who 
    works for Special Ops and also has a huge stick up his ass about a 
    mission gone wrong in the past where he blames himself for getting 
    his team killed (He won't even tell his new team his name, so they 
    call him Painter!). His latest assignment is to lead a new team of 
    soldiers to a Chechen nuclear power plant that has been taken over by 
    Russian baddie General Egor Zaysan (Dan Badaru) and rescue the 
    hostages and avert a nuclear war by killing the General and his band 
    of mercenaries, only to find out that they have been betrayed by one 
    of their own people and the Painter is left by himself to take care 
    of the situation. There is nothing here that you haven't seen a 
    thousand times before and the film moves at a deadly snail's pace. 
    You know a film is in trouble when it steals an entire dialogue 
    sequence from a Fred Olen Ray film (<B><A HREF="active_stealth_1999.htm">ACTIVE
     STEALTH</A></B> - 1999) because the film came in under time (And

    (2005) is award-nominated director Lee Daniel's first film in such a 
    capacity, and while it is not a total dud, there are enough 
    stereotypes to fill a subway car. The always-wonderful Helen Mirren 
    is Rose and Cuba Gooding Jr. is Mikey, a mother-stepson hit team (She 
    killed Mikey's father for murdering Mikey's mother and was also 
    beating Mikey with a belt) who work for nasty crime lord Clayton 
    Mayfield (Stephen Dorff, who shoots and kills two people just because 
    they were talking outside while he was having doggie-style sex with a 
    prostitute in his office [you get to see his full monty, condom and 
    all!] and then shoots his own man in the foot for letting it 
    happen!). Rose is slowly dying of cancer and her and Mikey's 
    relationship is also sexual (Mirren has never looked so sexy, proving 
    you don't have to be young to be a stunner) and during one job that 
    involves a mass hit, Rose refuses to kill pregnant Vicki (Vanessa 
    Ferlito), who just happens to be Mayfield's wife (who Mayfield 
    believed cheated on her, killing her supposed lover by tying him to a 
    pool table and sodomizing him with a pool stick!), whose water breaks 
    when she sees Rose's gun and Rose and Mikey deliver the baby boy 
    instead. They all (including Vicki) move to the suburbs and act like 
    an extended family, where Mikey and the boy begin a father-son 
    relationship after a rather dubious start. As Rose is fading away 
    fast by cancer, Mikey kills her in the best way imaginable (filled 
    with flashbacks on how thier relationship came to be), but you'll 
    have to watch the film to get the full details. Things come to a head 
    when Mayfield discovers that his wife is still alive and vows 
    revenge. If I make this film sound good, that's because there are 
    some very good parts, but most of the film is a disjointed mess (like 
    the relationship between Josesh Gordon-Levitt as Dr. Don and his 
    nurse/mistress Mo'Nique as &quot;Precious&quot; [the title of the 
    next film by Daniels in 2009, also starring Mo'Nique, who won a Best 
    Supporting Actress Oscar&reg; and was then promptly blackballed by 
    Hollywood for being &quot;too difficult&quot; to work with], who is 
    addicted to morphine and steals it from the hospital dispensary) and 
    singer Macy Gray always complaining about getting her money (and 
    getting a bullet instead). There is, of course a final face-off 
    between between Mikey and Mayfield, but it doesn't end the way that 
    you would think and what the young boy says at the end of the film 
    (the final dialogue in the movie) will have the hair on the back of 
    your neck standing on end. This may be the first positive-sounding 
    review that I have written for a film with more bad points than good, 
    but screenwriter Will Rokos (TV's <B><A HREF="copper_tv_series_2012.htm">COPPER</A></B> 
    - 2012-2013) just fills the film with too many stereotypes (although 
    there in an inordinate amount of male nudity in this film [mainly 
    male asses], more than female nudity, which some will find too 
    disturbing, but I found refreshing for the ladies and gay men). It's 
    a good badfilm to watch on a rainy day. This actually obtained a 
    theatrical release, where it was viciously torn apart by critics, but 
    I have seen much, much worse.</FONT></FONT></P>

    try at saving their marriage. Of course the little girl loses a

    kids from the 1940's begging for her help to destroy the witch, but 
    soon things get too weird not to believe her. They destroy the witch 
    by burning her alive and the children collect their teeth, which the 
    witch kept in a box and they all go the Heaven and everyone lives

    concerns an underground cave in Mexico that harbors unfriendly

    responsible for most of that network's original films CGI work) and, 
    second, there's the stunt casting of another rap star in a starring

     one!) A group of obnoxious teens are driving down a road when they 
    come upon a rugged truck driven by the deformed -faced Franklin 
    Mayhew (Bill Jacobson) who is probably the product of incest (as we 
    find out as the film goes on). One of the members in the SUV, Sophie 
    (Myiea Coy), decides to flash her tits to Mayhew and she stands 
    through the moon roof of the SUV and rich prick Mark (Alan Ritchson) 
    , who is driving his father's expensive vehicle, traps Sophie in the 
    moon roof by closing it on her body. Suddenly, a young girl runs out 
    in front of the vehicle, forcing Mark to swerve his car into the 
    woods, where Sophie is killed by an over-hanging tree&nbsp; branch 
    (This is usually done on horseback.) and she is nearly beheaded. Most 
    of the group (including the young girl they almost hit) run to the 
    nearest house to call the police and, yes, you guessed it, it is the 
    Mayhew house where ugly as sin Mrs. Mayhew (April Lang) tells them 
    they have no phone. The young girl is in on the whole thing and shows 
    one of the other young girls that the house has secret passageways 
    behind every wall, but Franklin Mayhew is waiting there with a 
    chainsaw to cut her to bits (cannibalism is implied). To make a long 
    story short, The Mayhews are looking for a girl to produce offspring 
    for them, so they don't have to commit incest any more. (How much 
    uglier can they get?) The ones that do not fit their needs are thrown 
    in a hole, have gasoline poured on them and burned to death. In the 
    beginning of the film we see Adam (Tom Nagel; director/actor of <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#ClownTown2015">CLOWNTOWN</A></B> 
    - 2015) fiddling with a Zippo lighter that just won't flame up, so we 
    know that it will come into play sooner or later. After drenching 
    Adam and Sarah (April Gilbert) with gasoline, they get Franklin so 
    mad that he jumps into the fire pit where Adam pulls out his Zippo 
    while Sarah escapes the pit. The Zippo finally flames up as Adam 
    sacrifices himself and Franklin burns to death in a big burst of 
    flames. In the finale, we see another batch of obnoxious teens 
    driving a car when Franklin's truck passes them by and a girl runs 
    into the road. The circle of death repeats itself. The biggest 
    question for me is how did Franklin survive the fire pit? Is he 
    fireproof? Or is he just so ugly that fire is afraid of him? While 
    not a terrible film, it is something we have seen dozens of times 
    before (<A HREF="wrong_turn.htm"><B>WRONG TURN</B></A> [2003] 
    anyone?). Many people will probably like this film because it is 
    bloody &amp; gory, has plenty of nudity and malformed bodies. I 
    almost gave this a positive review but it is much too generic for its 
    own good.; <B><A HREF="catch_44_2005.htm">CATCH .44</A></B> (2005) is 
    a non-linear story in the vein of Quentin Tarantino's <B><A HREF="pulp_fiction_1995.htm">PULP
     FICTION</A></B> (1994) and was considered so bad, that is wasn't 
    released on DVD and Blu-Ray until a limited theatrical/VOD release in 
    2011. While I don't consider it that bad, it is still bad enough to 
    belong in this category. Like Tarantino's film, this one is full of 
    long dialogue scenes, seeing the death of major characters before the 
    film ends (some in the very beginning) and full of double and 
    triple-crosses. The film is about three women thieves: Tes (Malin 
    Akerman), Kara (Nikki Reed) and Dawn (<B><A HREF="true_blood_cable_series.htm">TRUE
     BLOOD</A></B>'s Deborah Ann Woll), who are told by their boss Mel 
    (Bruce Willis in an extended cameo) to wait at an out-of-the-way 
    diner/bar, where they are supposed to steal a drug shipment that was 
    stolen from him. Since they botched their last job with Mel, it very 
    obvious why they are there: to be killed. We see the bloody deaths of 
    Dawn and Kara (in the film's defense, it is very bloody), while 
    flashbacks fill us in as to why they really are there. Barkeeper 
    Billy (Shea Wigham; <B><A HREF="boardwalk_empire_tv_series.htm">BOARDWALK
     EMPIRE</A></B> - 2010-2014) and Tes get into a Mexican standoff (He 
    has a shotgun and she has a .44 pistol), while fake police officer 
    Ronny (Forest Whitaker, who speaks in an annoying <B><A HREF="scarface_1983.htm">SCARFACE</A></B> 
    dialect), who we see in flashback has shot a real police officer in 
    the back of the head and has stolen his uniform (which is remarkably 
    blood-free considering the wound. The officer is not nearly as fat as 
    Ronny, but the uniform looks taylored for him!), enters the diner and 
    tries to get both people to lower their weapons. This is where the 
    film falls apart. Tes doesn't remember Ronny, even though we see in 
    flashback that he saved her from a handy customer in the titty bar 
    she was waitressing in (how could she not remember him?). The 
    non-linear story becomes annoying after a while and the 
    &quot;surprise&quot; ending is not much of a surprise. 
    Director/screenwriter Aaron Harvey (<B><A HREF="neighbor_2017.htm">THE
     NEIGHBOR</A></B> - 2017) relies a little too much on the Tarantino 
    touch, but his long dialogue scenes can't match Tarantino's in sheer 
    weirdnerss. This film's idea of clever is&nbsp; Dawn's putting a 
    cassette of Bruce Willis' album &quot;<I><A HREF="return_of_bruno_album_1987.htm">The

     (Remember that?) into the car's player as they are driving to the 
    diner/bar (we hear a short sound clip of Willis singing &quot;<I>Respect
     Yourself</I> &quot;). While bloody (we get to see Dawn have her 
    fingers blown off), it is obvious that Harvey was also trying to copy 
    Tarantino. There are better Tarantino rip-offs out there. Go look for 
    them instead. Or better yet, watch a Tarantino film.;<A NAME="RoadToL."></A> <B><A HREF="road_to_l_2005.htm">THE
     MYSTERY OF LOVECRAFT - ROAD TO L.</A></B> (2005) is an Italian found 
    footage film (shot partially in English with no English subtitles for 
    the Italian parts!) that has the nerve trying to get us to believe it 
    is an honest-to-goodness real documentary, but you would have to be a 
    total idiot to believe that. When an old manuscript is found in an 
    Italy library that implies H.P. Lovecraft visited Italy in 1926, 
    American actor David (Roberto Davide; <B><A HREF="red_2_2013.htm">RED 2</A></B> 
    - 2013; here using the pseudonym &quot;David Purvis&quot;) gets 
    financing to go to Italy to find out if Lovecraft actually visited 
    Italy, even though Lovecraft was a pauper all his life and couldn't 
    afford to travel to Italy. Many believe that Lovecraft's Innsmouth 
    and Cthulhu stories, written after 1926, are based on truth and the 
    creatures in those stories are actually real. David sets out to 
    discover if that is so, so he and a small crew, which consists of his 
    girlfriend Simonetta (Simonetta Solder; Argento's <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#MotherOfTears">MOTHER

    work!), try to find the small village Lovecraft supposedly stayed in 
    in 1926 (Only referred to as &quot;L.&quot; in the manuscript). As 
    soon as they step on Italian soil, their documentary takes several 
    wrong turns. First, the guide David hired by email to show them where 
    &quot;L.&quot; is located has been missing for over seven years; his 
    car was discovered by the Po River, all his notes scattered on the 
    ground, but no body has ever been found (So whom did David contact by 
    email?), so David and his crew go out on their own to try and find 
    it. They get lost several times, so they hire an elderly guide who 
    never stops talking, but he leads them to nothing but dead ends 
    (purposely?). David and his crew finally manage to find 
    &quot;L.&quot;, but it is completely abandoned, yet when they film 
    the shuttered houses, they hear children singing inside (The only 
    good portion of this poorly constructed film). David wants to go into 
    one of the houses to try to find the children, but the crew is too 
    scared to go with him. This is when David turns into an insufferable 
    bastard, putting his crew and girlfriend down so many times, most of 
    them leave, except for Simonetta and Fabrizio (David insults soundman 
    Fausto by saying a monkey could do his job!).The ending (or 
    non-ending, like in most found-footage films) comes when the trio 
    finds out that at least one of the creatures is real and ends with 
    the screams of the trio, even though we never get a good look at the 
    creature, only blocky green &quot;night vision&quot; footage of it 
    (God, I hate that &quot;found footage&quot; trope!), which we never 
    see clearly, as Fabrizio drops the camera and screams. Need I say 
    more? All this &quot;film&quot; has to offer is nauseating swirling 
    camera footage and David's sickening behavior towards his crew. It's 
    either his way or the highway and most of his crew prefer the latter. 
    I don't blame them, as this is a documentary that is doomed from the 
    beginning. The locals refuse to talk to David or the crew about 
    Lovecraft, so the film becomes more about David's abusive behavior 
    and less about Lovecraft. I can't believe it took two 
    directors/screenwriters, Federico Greco &amp; Roberto Leggio, to make 
    this mess of a film and looking at their resum&eacute;s, they have 
    done nothing of note since then (this small review was written in the 
    latter part of 2019). It's easy to see why. This film stinks worse 
    than a minute-long fart after eating a big bowl of chili. It doesn't 
    help that half of the film is in untranslated Italian (my Italian is 
    good enough to understand what was being said, but those without the 
    ability shouldn't worry, as it offers nothing to the plot, just 
    people telling us that the creatures are real, trying to make us 
    believe this is a real documentary). If you are a found footage 
    completist (and I pity you!) and must see this film, it is available 
    on YouTube from user &quot;Film&amp;Clips&quot; (under its Italian 
    title: &quot;Il Mistero Di Lovecraft - Road To L.&quot;). Just don't 
    say I didn't warn you! They say that Lovecraft's stories are

     that term very loosely, as most of the jokes fall flatter than 
    yeast-free pancakes (Mmmm...pancakes!). We see graverobbers Gus 
    (Jeremy) and his simpleton partner Jake (Justin Alvarez) robbing the 
    grave of supposed vampire Count Teufel (Michael Todd Schneider), Gus 
    wanting the amulet Teufel wears around his neck because it is very 
    valuable.&nbsp; When Jake digs up the coffin and opens it, It looks 
    like Teufel was buried yesterday, as his body hasn't decomposed in 
    the least. When Jake rips the amulet from Teufel's neck, Teufel bites 
    him on the arm and for some unexplained reason all the people buried 
    in the cemetery rise from their graves (apparently, none of them were 
    buried in coffins, as they dig their way out of thier graves with 
    their hands!) and chase the duo, who beat a hasty retreat. At the 
    same time this is happening, seven overage cliched teenagers decide 
    to have a Halloween party at a haunted house that is being used for a 
    horror film shoot, not knowing the the cemetery next to the house is 
    where all the zombies have suddenly come to life. I don't think I 
    have to tell you what comes next, as this film doesn't miss one 
    horror film trope, including the bitten being turned into zombies, 
    the only way to kill zombies is to pummel them in the head and other 
    tropes that were overused in zombie films. There is not one thing 
    that happens in this film that comes as a surprise. It's a 
    by-the-numbers horror flick, with plenty of nudity, below average 
    gore effects (although some of the zombie makeups are effective) and 
    lousy acting by the cast. You'll be looking at the clock waiting for 
    the film to end (At least I did, but I have to because I need to warn 
    you, my dear readers, so you don't have to suufer as I did!) as this 
    film just plods along until the rushed ending, promises a sequel, 
    which, thankfully, never happened. Director/producer John Poague, 
    working with a screenplay written by David Zagorski, has fashioned a 
    film without any merit, as it is nothing but the same old, same old, 
    that you have seen at least a hundred times and done a thousand times 
    better. What it does badly is play with the normal zombie conventions 
    and then suddenly totally forgets about them, especially when one 
    character gets bitten and doesn't turn into a zombie, all for the 
    sake of a &quot;happy ending&quot;. Even the bloopers shown during 
    the end credits failed to elicit a laugh from me. Not once did I 
    laugh and I found myself feeling sorry for Ron Jeremy for appearing 
    in crap like this because he deserves better (He is one of the few 
    porn actors to have a second career acting in genre films and, most 
    of the time, he is good when given a role he can sink his teeth into, 
    even if it is only a cameo, like in <B><A HREF="#BloodyBibleCamp2011">BLOODY

    help of paranormal investigator Geoffrey Hunt (a slumming Forest

    banal as it is boring. Seems like a few teenagers accidentally killed 
    a teenage girl and the little girl shot and killed the angry teenage 
    boy who wanted to enlist the help of his doctor father to cover-up 
    the crime. The other teens throw the bodies of the dead teenage girl

    (2006) is the term &quot;torture porn&quot; was created for. It is

    dissolves from the inside out and then we see the killer give a 
    tied-up woman an acid shower, making mince meat of her face. The

    killing her pet miniature dog (every model has one) and keeping her 
    on her toes with threats against her life. She meets fellows kidnapee 
    Gary Dexter (Daniel Gillies) and from that point on, you would have 
    to be deaf, dumb and blind not to see what is going to happen next. 
    Yes, Gary is working along with partner and brother Ben Dexter (a 
    googly-eyed Pruitt Taylor Vince) kidnapping, torturing and finally 
    killing their prey, only this time Gary has fallen for Jennifer and 
    kills brother Ben (well he actually doesn't finish the job; Jennifer 
    does with a sharp knife to his side). After Ben kills two nosy 
    detectives with a shotgun, the dumb-as-a-brick Jennifer finally 
    catches on (she actually kills a Detective who is not quite dead 
    yet!) and discovers Gary is the serial killer. She first forgets to

    and a struggle ensues and Jennifer pumps three shotgun shells into 
    Ben and thanks him for the firearms lesson. She then steps out of the 
    house like nothing happened and walks home. THE END. Director Roland

    absolutely no redeeming values. She is just a spoiled, rich brat who 
    likes to get her way (and watches the search for her on TV with 
    supreme interest because it keeps her in the news). There's not one

     THE SPIDER'S WEB</A></B> (2006) is another cheap Sci-Fi Channel (now

    forest (actually filmed in Thailand) who come to a small village in 
    the middle of nowhere when one of their female members is bitten by a 
    poisonous spider. There they meet an American doctor (Lance 
    Henriksen, who needs a new agent), who is actually a leader of a cult 
    that worships spiders and uses the spiders' victims to sell their 
    organs on the black market. There's a man with a burlap sack over his 
    head which is supposedly Henriksen's brother and the surgeon in 
    charge (we finally see what's under the burlap at the end of the 
    film), a whole bunch of different species of spiders (some of them 
    done in bad CGI) and a cavern full of extra-strong spider webs. The

    major roads, but he doesn't have two nickels to rub together. Sidney 
    tells him that he has a perfect way to get the money: Kidnap a young 
    adopted 8 year-old boy named David (Blake Woodruff), whose New 
    England socialite non-biological mother (Teryl Rothery; <B><A HREF="operative_2000.htm">THE
     OPERATIVE</A></B> - 2000) is rich and hold him for ransom. Max at 
    first turns down Sidney's proposal (Roxanne is against it, too), but 
    after he gets turned down for a loan from all the banks, Max decides 
    to go through the kidnapping with Sidney, Roxanne, and Vince (Joel

    out to a summer camp that is closed for the winter, in the same woods

    woman turns out to have been David's nanny). Right from the start it 
    is plain to see that David has a little Devil in him. As a matter of 
    fact, he may actually be a little Devil. It turns out whatever he 
    says to people actually happens and when Max and Vince head to town 
    to call the master of the kidnapping, Jones (he has his voice altered 
    on the phone, but it isn't hard to reason the voice is altered

    Even though my girl Tiffany Shepis is one of the stars of this 
    standard stalk 'n' slash film, it doesn't mean that it is good. On 
    the contrary. A woman (Blythe Metz) mistakenly receives an African 
    fertility mask in the mail (she and her husband are looking to 
    conceive and were waiting for an Italian fertility mask) and she (and 
    only she) begins to see the title character. It gets so bad that she 
    needs to take anxiety medication to control her fears and, as her 
    husband is driving her to a mental hospital for treatment, the car 
    breaks down and the husband goes off on his own to get some help. The 
    Nightmare Man appears and chases the woman to a house filled with 
    people who don't believe her story. They should have listened to her, 
    because not only is the Nightmare Man real and begins killing the 
    cast, the woman is also harboring a secret of her own. The surprise 
    ending can be seen a mile away and the film is unremarkable; I heard 
    lots of good word of mouth about the urban drama <B><A HREF="weapons_2006.htm">WEAPONS</A></B> 
    (2006), but I couldn't believe how boring and banal it actually was. 
    The film opens with an overlong static shot of Nick Cannon taking 
    bites out of a cheeseburger with too much ketchup on it. After what 
    seems a lifetime, an out-of-focus-figure in the background enters the 
    fast food restaurant, cocks a shotgun and blows half of Cannon's head 
    off (definitely the best part of the film). The rest of the film is a 
    series of vignettes about both white and black teenagers that 
    slooooowly become inter-related (For an 82-minute film, it seems 
    twice as long). I was hoping for better, since Paul Dano was one of 
    those teens who never goes anywhere without his video<A HREF="devil_ivy_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/devil ivy poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    camera (it plays an important part in one shooting, actually the only 
    other shooting on the entire film), but director/screenwriter Adam 
    Bhala Lough (basically a documentary filmmaker) is definitely no 
    Larry Clark when it comes to stories about troubled kids. I was bored 
    beyond tears, which is why Lough was nominated for the Grand Jury 
    Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. If you need to get some sleep, 
    by all means watch this film (the droning music score by Ethan Higbee 
    doesn't help matters). The Sandman will come quickly.;<A NAME="DevilIvy2006"></A> <B><A HREF="devil_ivy_2006.htm">DEVIL
     IVY</A></B> (2006) is a Thailand fantasy/horror film about the 
    search for the Nariphon Tree, which is said to bear fruit that can 
    cure any disease, even cancer. A team of scientists hire a 
    witchdoctor/spirit guide and his men to search for the only tree in 
    the Thailand jungle that grows the fruit, not knowing that it is 
    protected by an evil demon who first appears as a nearly-naked 
    beautiful woman, who tempts men to make love to her, but when they 
    do, she turns into a vampire-like creature who takes a huge bite out 
    of their necks, killing them. Sorry to say, but this film relies on 
    too much CGI and some of the plot twists are very hard to swallow, 
    such as a pretty young geneticist who wants to take a bath at the 
    most inopportune times and one guide on the expedition who looks at 
    her constantly with lust in his eyes (He finally tries to rape her, 
    but her boyfriend beats the crap out of him). Director Vichian Ta-in 
    tries to give us some bloody set-pieces, but it is obvious the 
    Thailand censors had a great deal of influence on how far he could go 
    (The women never show their full breasts, as their nipples are 
    covered with paint or pasties and they are photographed at angles 
    that hide their naughty bits). It is violent, but it is also very 
    boring. If you are an Amazon Prime member, you can see this for free,

    you can guess the ending as soon as the excitement starts. Gerard

    are then kidnapped in their car by Pierce Brosnan and told to do what 
    he says or their little girl back home will be killed. They have to 
    withdraw all their money while Brosnan burns it and throws it off a

    painful (emotionally, not physically), but it is so obvious that 
    Brosnan is getting help that the &quot;surprise&quot; finale could be 
    seen coming a mile away and when it is exposed, it is in such a

     theatrical film</A> starring Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman. The plot 
    is basically the same as the first film, only the country is 
    different. Lt. Robert James (Nicholas Gonzalez; <B><A HREF="anacondas_the_hunt_for_the_blood_orchid_2004.htm">ANACONDAS:
     THE HUNT FOR THE BLOOD ORCHID</A></B> - 2004) and three other Navy 
    SEALS are dropped into North Korea to destroy a nuclear missile that 
    they are about to fire. Trouble is, South Korea objects to the 
    mission and Robert and his SEALS are trapped behind enemy lines, with 
    no hope of help from their own country. After two of the SEALS are 
    killed in a firefight, Robert is captured, along with an injured MCPO 
    Neil 'Spaz' Callaghan (Matt Bushell; <B><A HREF="twilight_2008.htm">TWILIGHT</A></B> 
    - 2008). Robert is tortured by having a spike driven through his left 
    hand, but he survives by thinking about his trainer, MCPO Scott 
    Boytano (Keith David in flashbacks), and how he taught him and the 
    rest of his Navy SEAL team how to survive in the worst of conditions 
    (There is a funny flashback involving Keith David on an airplane that 
    will have you laughing, the only funny part of the film). 
    Unfortunately, the film is just one firefight after another (filmed 
    either in slow-motion or by having the film stop dead in its tracks 
    and then having the shot person flying backwards; there is even a 
    bullet POV shot), with Robert and Spaz joining forces with South 
    Korean freedom fighters to try and get the hell out of North Korea. 
    They finally do, but the whole operation has to be kept a secret, 
    since the nuclear missile misfired and exploded in North Korea. I was 
    expecting a lot more, especially with a supporting cast that included

    even though it's more competent than most of Asylum's output, that 
    still doesn't make it a good film. The tagline on the DVD says 
    &quot;In the tradition of Tod Browning's <B><A HREF="freaks_1932.htm">FREAKS</A></B>&quot;
     (1932), but it's more like a carbon copy, except with nudity and 
    some very graphic violence. A group of normal workers at a traveling 
    circus decide to rob the week's take of the ticket sales, but Lucy 
    (Rebekah Kochan; The Asylum's <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HalloweenNight2006">HALLOWEEN
     NIGHT</A></B> - 2006) has a better idea: She will get the attention 
    of Lon (Christopher Adamson; <B><A HREF="leatherface_2017.htm">LEATHERFACE</A></B> 
    - 2017; who sports puss-filled boils all over his body), the leader 
    of the freaks, and will use her womanly charms to get him to marry 
    her. She will then kill him, inherit all his money and share it 
    evenly with the other normal workers. If you have seen Tod Browning's 
    film, you <A HREF="freakshow_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("142","212") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/freakshow 2007 dvd front6a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>know
     what to expect. Things go horribly wrong and the freaks kill the 
    workers in various bloody ways (the Strongman crushes one of the 
    worker's heads like a grape with his large wooden mallet; the Armless 
    Man uses his feet to throw a knife at another worker and kills him, a 
    topless woman bites a huge chunk out of a worker's neck, etc.), but 
    they save their best revenge on Lucy. They cut out her tongue with 
    shears, sew her lips together with thick cord, cut off her toes with 
    the same shears, peel the skin off her face, cut off one of her 
    breasts and perform some impromptu surgery on her torso, all in 
    loving closeup (the best part of the film, if you are a sick 
    bastard). Lon then introduces Lucy as &quot;The Worm Woman&quot; to a 
    sparse crowd of paying customers and the women in the crowd scream. 
    Yes, she's quite to sight, learning a little too late not to fuck 
    around with a &quot;family&quot; of freaks. Horribly acted by nearly 
    everyone (especially Rebekah Kochan as Lucy), the film does work 
    slightly on one level by using real freaks in the film, mixing them 
    in with makeup creations. The armless man is truly a marvel, throwing 
    knives with his feet more accurately than those with hands and even 
    lighting his cigarette with a match using his feet. We also have two 
    &quot;freaks&quot; (That's a loose term in this instance) who have 
    hooks attached to their backs and jump around in circles while 
    suspended on elastic ropes, as we watch the skin on their backs 
    stretch like melted cheese where the hooks are attached. The film 
    also uses real old-timey music as the soundtrack, since the film 
    takes place in the 1920s or 1930s (it is never made clear). Besides 
    plentiful nudity, some real freaks and the really graphic violence at 
    the end of the film, there's not much to recommend here.&nbsp; We 
    never see any paying customers in the traveling circus until the end 
    of the film, where the transformed Lucy is introduced, making me 
    wonder why the workers would want to steal a week's take of ticket 
    sales. It probably wouldn't buy a pack of gum. The DVD sleeve and 
    posters also declare &quot;Banned in 43 Countries&quot;, but that's 
    nothing but standard The Asylum bullshit. Besides the final ten 
    minutes, there's nothing here that would get banned even in the most 
    strict of countries. In other words, typical The Asylum garbage. It 
    should also be noted that director Drew Bell never made another film 
    after this (this review was written in early-October 2021). When The 
    Asylum doesn't let you direct another one of their 
    &quot;Mockbusters&quot;, you know how bad this film really is. 
    Competency does not equal a watchable film.</FONT></FONT></P>

    and is about as threatening as a dog with no legs (watch <B><A HREF="blast_2004.htm">BLAST</A></B>

    agent whose cop son is murdered in the worst part of town. Seagal 
    moves to the barrio to get the person responsible and hooks-up with 
    Griffin, who shows him how to get along in the ghetto. There are some 
    good action scenes (and the appearance of Danny Trejo doesn't hurt, 
    either, since they both fought a memorable fight during the finale of 
    director Robert Rodriguez's film <B><A HREF="machete_2010.htm">MACHETE</A></B>

    (2007) is one of the very few R-Rated religious films disguised as a 
    horror film. It comes from the novel written by Frank Peretti &amp; 
    Ted Dekker (both co-producers here), whose previous novels have been 
    turned into the films <B><A HREF="hangmans_curse_2003.htm">THE 
    HANGMAN'S CURSE</A></B> (2003); <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Visitation">THE
     VISITATION</A></B> (2005) and <B><A HREF="thr3e_2006.htm">THR3E</A></B> 
    (2006), all PG-13 Rated religious films with horror overtones. It was 
    also directed by Robby Henson, whose fort&eacute; seems to be weird 
    religious films (including two of the above, not counting this film). 
    This mish-mash of a film concerns two couples who are stranded at a 
    creepy Bed &amp; Breakfast when both of their cars are in accidents. 
    All of them have deep, dark secrets which come into the foreground 
    when the house comes under attack by the Tin Man (Do not, and I 
    repeat, DO NOT read the credits of the film on IMDb to discover who 
    the Tin Man is before watching the film) and makes their past 
    transgressions fuck with their minds. It's all highly confusing, but 
    contains a bunch of good actors, including Bill Moseley, Leslie 
    Easterbrook (who appeared together in Rob Zombie's <B><A HREF="devils_rejects_2005.htm">THE
     DEVIL'S REJECTS</A></B> - 2005), Michael Madsen and Lew Temple 
    (Lance Henriksen supplies the voice of the Tin Man so it doesn't give 
    away the identity of who it really is too soon). There are a few 
    bloody shots in the film, but it skirts the PG-13/R-Rating ever so 
    slightly (if it weren't for the shotgun death of a child and a few 
    more small&nbsp; trims, it could be Rated PG-13). It also has one of 
    those endings where those who repent their sins get away and the 
    others who sins can't be forgiven (such as killing your abusive 
    father with a shotgun when you are a child when he tries to kill a 
    deer) are killed and shows us that the Tin Man may actually be the 
    Devil. At least this film doesn't try to cram religion down your 
    throat, but as a regular supernatural film it is still a mess. Now 
    they just make pure religious films trying to tell us God is real and 
    spoon feed the pablum to us with their silver spoons. This film 
    failed terribly at theaters when it was shown in November 2008 (two 
    years after it finished filming), making a measly $329,836 at 363 
    theaters. This film ended the religious horror movie, even though 
    people have said that the book is fantastic. If it's anything like 
    the film, these people need to see a priest right away. Or a shrink.;<A NAME="DarkPlace2007"></A> <B><A HREF="darkplace_2007.htm">DARKPLACE</A></B> 
    (2007) is an extremely confusing and repetitive film that most 
    reviewers failed to understand, but that does not make it a good 
    film. It was also Matthew McGrory's (&quot;Tiny Firefly&quot; in <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#House 1000 Corpses">HOUSE
     OF 1000 CORPSES</A></B> - 2002 and <B><A HREF="devils_rejects_2005.htm">THE

    finishing it (in August of 2005), as it took

     Philip Adrian Booth (<B><A HREF="death_tunnel_2004.htm">DEATH TUNNEL</A></B> 
    - 2004) two years to make the film releasable (and dedicate the film 
    to McGrory's memory). And it looks it. The story (which seems to take 
    place in the '40's or '50s for some unknown reason) finds a 
    psychiatrist, Dr. Virgil Nichols (Dougald Park) receiving a 
    mysterious package containing old Polaroid photos (!) and then 
    getting a mysterious phone call telling him to come to the town of 
    Darkwood because there is someone he needs to see. Virgil gets all 
    nervous, as he keeps a board of newspaper articles in his office 
    containing stories of suicides and child disappearances in Darkwood 
    and it looks like he has been collecting them for quite some time. 
    When he gets to the town, he sees a sign that reads &quot;ENTER<B>IN</B>G
     <B>FERN</B> C<B>O</B>UNTY&quot; (pay attention to the bold letters) 
    and is picked up by a hillbilly giant named Hort Willows (McGrory; 
    whom we see kill a policeman<A HREF="darkplace_2007.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/darkplace 2007 poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="171" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    with a sickle just before running into Virgil)) who brings him to a 
    house containing teenager Ian (Timothy Lee DePriest), who can't 
    remember the last ten years of his life (I'm making the plot as 
    simple as possible for you to understand, but the film is an editing 
    nightmare, full of flashbacks and flash-forwards that don't make much 
    sense). It's obvious that Virgil knows Ian, as he treated him when he 
    was a boy (played by Benjamin Bryan). Ian was found by Virgil when he 
    was young locked in a wooden &quot;ShadowBox&quot; (the film's 
    shooting title) for five days to &quot;face his demons&quot; (no one 
    has survived more than two days in the box), a punishment by his 
    psychotic priest father (Galen Schrick, who wears a wig that makes 
    him look like a Rockabilly musician!) after discovering his mother 
    hung by her neck in a barn. Young Ian believed his father killed his 
    mother, yet the newspapers and police reported it as a suicide, even 
    though Ian knows his mother would never do such a thing. After about 
    about 85 minutes of extremely confusing and repetitive flashbacks and 
    flash-forwards, it turns out that the entire film is nothing but a 
    product of young Ian's fragmented mind as he is locked in the 
    ShadowBox. The whole film is nothing but a big fakeout; a figment of 
    young Ian's imagination. His mother didn't die, she is still alive. 
    It was his father who committed suicide. When Virgil pulls Ian out of 
    the ShadowBox and we discover the truth, many people didn't 
    understand it, which is why most reviewers (both professional and 
    amateur) gave it scathing reviews. It's not a good film by any 
    stretch of the imagination, but it does have above-average 
    cinematography and an atmosphere of dread quite unlike any other film 
    out there. Too bad it is so confusing. The screenplay, written by 
    brothers Philip Adrian &amp; Christopher Saint Booth (billed as 
    &quot;The Booth Brothers&quot;) is based partially on author Dante 
    Alighieri's 14th Century poem &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; (a.k.a. 
    &quot;Dante's Inferno&quot;, a book Ian's father carries around like 
    it's the Bible), is very sluggish and infuriating until the final 
    &quot;aha!&quot; moment, a moment many viewers failed to comprehend. 
    Both Booth Brothers are professional Paranormal Investigators and 
    have released many documentaries of their exploits and Christopher 
    also supplied the film's eerie music score (billed as 
    &quot;Christopher Saint&quot;). It would help explain the film's very 
    dark, foreboding tone. Look for late actor Irwin Keyes (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LegendPhantomRider">LEGEND
     OF THE PHANTOM RIDER</A></B> - 2000) in a cameo as a mechanic. I 
    should also say that even though the 7' 6&quot; Matthew McGrory gets 
    star billing, he's only in the film for less than ten minutes and he 
    really looks frail and in pain (He died of congestive heart failure 
    and had acromegaly, the same disease Rhondo Hatton had [they look 
    strikingly similar!]). While not a total failure, this film still 
    belongs in this category.</FONT></FONT></P>

    the population of his small Pennsylvania town (and to also save his 
    daughter, because his wife has already died of the disease). Cut to 
    the present day, when a bunch of young adults stumble upon the same 
    town and everyone there seems not to have aged a year since 1859. 
    Their are two caveats, however: They must never leave the town or 
    they will wither of old age and die and they must sacrifice one 
    person a year to a giant Ogre that lives in the area. Since the 
    population of the town is dwindling because all the women seem to be 
    barren, these young adults seem perfect for the sacrifice. The rest 
    of the film has the surviving outsiders trying to find a way to 
    defeat the Ogre with the help of Schneider's daughter (Chelan 
    Simmons), who never agreed with her father's decision and wants to

    the story from the titled zombie's (Alastair Kirton) point of view. 
    Some people, especially at film festivals, think that is enough to 
    merit awards, but I'm a little more difficult to satisfy. To me, it's 
    nothing but a boring tale of a zombie walking around London chewing 
    on people and showing the cheapness of the production. Too much 
    shakey digital camerawork and handheld POV camera shots for my taste,

    (1984). A sparsly-filled train headed in America for parts unknown 
    (even though it is plain to see it was shot in Romania) has a dead 
    man found on it by the Conductor Miles (Danny Glover), med student 
    Chloe (Leelee Sobieski) and con man Pete (Steve Zahn). They discover 
    the dead man is holding a strangely-shaped box and when they look 
    through the lens on the side of the box, they all delcare that they 
    will be millionaires (we are never let on to what they are seeing,

    back and forth with Miles, who seems to be the only one of the trio

    of the train car they are in (Nothing they can do can even scratch

    biggest suitcase they can find (something Chloe seems to relish) and 
    then throw the suitcase off the train when the train crosses the 
    bridge so the police will not know where it ever came from thanks to

    train who want the box, too, including two oriental men and a 
    transvestite (Richard O'Brien from <B><A HREF="rocky_horror_picture_show_1975.htm">THE

    unscheduled stop when the police find the body parts of the dead man 
    floating in the river (seems the suitcase opened upon impact with the 
    water), search the train and interrogate the passengers before they 
    disembark, while a strange man is also looking for the box. He tells 
    the trio that whomever looks through the lens in the box is doomed to 
    die within 24 hours (and everyone sees something different when they 
    look through the lens of the box, whether it be emeralds, diamonds, 
    gold or something else extremely valuable). He makes it sound that 
    the contents of this box are not from Earth (this is conjecture on my 
    part; the film never comes out and says it). Then all hell breaks 
    loose as everyone fights for the box (the strange man gets a bullet 
    shot into his left eye when he struggles with Pete. Pretty soon it is 
    only Miles and Chloe left (everyone has either shot each other to 
    death, had their neck impaled with a corkscrew, suffocated or bashed 
    their heads in) and Miles brings the box with him and tries to 
    uncouple the car when the brake switch doesn't work. Chloe, armed 
    with a pistol begins to fire at Miles until she runs out of bullets 
    and Miles finally uncouples the car, but the box falls off the train. 
    Chloe holds on between the two separating cars until she is ripped in 
    half (a really quick shot that you will have to see frame-by-frame) 
    and Miles waits for his cars to stop and looks for the box (he has 
    the key that unopens the box; it is a ring on the dead strange man's 
    hand). He finds the box and uses the ring ot open it. All we see as 
    viewers is a bright yellow light as Miles passes away. A little girl 
    finds the box as it closes, stares into the camera, smiles and the 
    film ends. Huh? While quite professionally made, 
    director/screenwriter Brian King (his first time as director) really 
    has nothing to show for his efforts. He lets the audience down by not 
    showing an inkling what's inside the box (at least the two other

    Tarantino's <B><A HREF="pulp_fiction_1995.htm">PULP FICTION</A></B>

     NIGHT: THE LEGEND OF MARY HATCHET</A></B> (2008) will appeal to gore 
    fanatics, but those looking for more than a generic plot should look 
    somewhere else. Twenty years ago, a young and disturbed Mary Hatchet 
    (Patricia Raven) kills her older sister (a scissors in the eye 
    followed by an axe in the head) and father (an axe swing to the 
    mouth) and is committed to a mental institution. Ten years later, 
    Mary (now played by Samantha Facchi) is raped by a slimey orderly and 
    becomes pregnant, losing the child during childbirth (or so we are 
    led to believe). She escapes her room and kills everyone and is shot 
    dead by two policemen when she throws the severed head of her doctor 
    on the hood of their police car. The killings becomes known as 
    &quot;Blood Night&quot; and all the high school kids (including 
    Danielle Harris, giving us another one of her off kilter [a.k.a. bad] 
    performances) celebrate it like it is the night before Halloween 
    (complete with egg throwing and TP'ing people's houses). A slew of 
    teens get together to throw a Blood Night party and are soon 
    slaughtered one-by-one what turns out to be Mary's daughter (Spoiler: 
    It's Danielle Harris, who has a confusing and way too bloody 
    menstrual scene in this film), who begins killing everyone in the 
    cast, including Bill Moseley as Graveyard Gus (who leads the kids to 
    Mary's now-closed mental institution). One guy has his face cut in 
    half with an axe; another has a pick-axe planted in his balls; 
    Moseley gets the pick-axe through the throat; another guy has his 
    hand chopped off and in the &quot;surprise&quot; ending (which a 
    retard could see coming a mile away), our hero (Nate Dushku), has his 
    head decapitated by Mary for killing her daughter. Gore lovers will 
    probably like this, although after the first five minutes, you'll 
    have to wait another 60 minutes to get to the gore scenes, but 
    everyone else should just stay away. Director/producer/writer Frank

    (2000), only this sequel (which stars none of the original film's 
    actors) simplifies the concept until it becomes nothing but a very 
    ordinary thriller. Maya (Tessie Santiago) is a &quot;psychic 
    investigator&quot; (someone who can see crimes through the killer's 
    eyes) who has been after a serial killer called &quot;The Cusp&quot; 
    (Frank Whaley), who kills and then brings his victims back to life 
    over and over. Maya's reputation had become tarnished a year earlier 
    when she failed to save one of The Cusp's victims, but he is at it 
    again and has kidnapped cop Harris' (Chris Bruno) daughter, so he 
    enlists the help of Maya to help find her before The Cusp finally 
    kills her (he has killed her and brought her back to life several 
    times). Maya gets into The Cusp's mind (who is extremely scared of 
    the dark) and gets closer to exposing him (she has never seen his 
    face since she is only able to see through his eyes), while Harris is 
    falsely accused as being the killer. The finale can be seen coming 
    way before the film ends and this has to have one of the longest end 
    credits sequence in history (over ten minutes, where in between every 
    name there are helicopter shots of landscapes and two ordinary behind 
    the scenes stunt sequences). This Utah-lensed film, directed by Tim 
    Iacofano (who is usually a TV series episode director and it shows 
    here), is just another one of Miramax's quick sequels that was made 
    so they could retain the rights to the title. Nothing here screams 
    out &quot;Watch me!&quot;;<A NAME="DrSleepless2008"></A> I was quite 
    perplexed by the purpose of a film named <B><A HREF="dr_sleepless_2008.htm">DR
     SLEEPLESS</A></B> (2008; and no, there is no period in the 
    &quot;DR&quot; title), especially when hearing with my own ears 
    Christopher Walken narrating Edgar Allan Poe's &quot;The Raven&quot; 
    throughout the film's entire running time, but never showing himself 
    (his narration is even turned into a weird rap-like musical version 
    during the opening credits!). That is until I found out it was 
    directed/produced/written by &quot;England's Worst Filmmaker&quot; 
    (named that by many prominent critics and writers), Richard Driscoll, 
    who also acts under the pseudonym &quot;Steven Craine&quot;. Driscoll 
    had the uncanny ability to talk many well-known American actors into 
    appearing in his no-budget films (many say that was his one and only 
    talent), which were made in his own little movie studio in the middle 
    of nowhere (only accessable by helicopter!). He would then claim tax 
    credits for these films and be paid millions of pounds by the British 
    government, which was actually much more than he actually spent. He 
    did this so often, he was finally sent to court for tax fraud and 
    spent three years in prison starting in 2013. When he got out of 
    prison, he took all the films he made prior, re-edited them, renamed 
    them and released them like they were new films. He convinced Amazon 
    Prime that this film was a new 2020 production (based on the opening 
    logo, where his production company, House Of Fear, begged viewers to 
    join his Patreon page!), when this was originally a 2008 film 
    originally titled <B><A HREF="dr_sleepless_2008.htm">EVIL CALLS: THE RAVEN</A></B>,
     then changed to <B><A HREF="dr_sleepless_2008.htm">THE LEGEND OF 
    HARROW WOODS</A></B> and also released on DVD in the United States as <B><A HREF="dr_sleepless_2008.htm">666:
     SALEM CALLING</A></B> (Amazon Prime has the film available under 
    this title, too)! This is a ridiculously cheap film starring the late 
    Rik Mayall (who passed away in 2014) and famous British comedian 
    Norman Wisdom (this was his final film), as well as Robin Askwith (<B><A HREF="horror_hospital_1973.htm">HORROR
     HOSPITAL</A></B> - 1973), Eileen Daly (<B><A HREF="razor_blade_smile_1998.htm">RAZOR
     BLADE SMILE</A></B> - 1998) and Driscoll himself using his 
    &quot;Steven Craine&quot; nom de plume. It's an awful <B><A HREF="blair_witch_project_1999.htm">BLAIR
     WITCH PROJECT</A></B> (1999) knock-off about a team of 
    &quot;Internetters&quot; who investigate a famous writer and his 
    family's disappearance from their summer cabin in Harrow Woods a year 
    earlier, where, hundreds of years ago, a witch once cursed the 
    grounds before she was burned alive. I really can't say any more 
    because the film is hard to understand (what the fuck does this have 
    to do with Poe's &quot;Raven&quot;?), as the rest of the plot is 
    non-existent. Really, it is, but it does contain plentiful female 
    nudity, a smidgen of cheap gore and nothing else. It is also full of 
    bad re-editing, where the same reverse explosion effect ties scenes 
    together that have nothing to do with each other. Do yourself a favor 
    and just stay clear.;<A NAME="SpringBreakMass08"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B><A HREF="spring_break_massacre_2008.htm">SPRING

    Yates being one of them. The film then switches over to some overage 
    teenage hotties who decide to celebrate Spring Break in the home of 
    Heather Kilbourne (Sarah Minnic), whose strict father (John Shumski) 
    is leaving on a business trip. Before you can say &quot;Kill 
    everyone!&quot;, Stanley Peterson begins dispatching everyone in ways 
    we never see happen on screen, including Deputy Michelle Hendricks 
    (Linnea Quigley) and all the teen's boyfriends. The girls must also 
    put up with the constant appearance of Heather's pervy neighbor Ralph 
    Malone (Bob Farster). We are then exposed to a &quot;surprise&quot; 
    finale that's not much of a surprise at all, as it was Heather's 
    father doing all the killing. You see, he has a one million dollar 
    life insurance policy on his daughter and he needs the money badly, 
    so he breaks Stanley out of prison, ties him up and begins killing 
    everyone; all the murders will be blamed on Stanley (Mr. Kilbourne 
    shoots Stanley in the chest and tells Heather that his death will be 
    deemed a suicide! Whaaaat???). But Mr. Kilbourne didn't expect 
    Sheriff Yates to be so smart (or rather, lucky), as Dad is about to 
    kill Heather (everyone else is already dead), Sheriff Yates shoots 
    him in the back. This awful film is nothing but a bunch of horror 
    film cliches, only with horrible acting, bad cinematography (the film 
    was shot is six nights and it looks it) and hardly any nudity, a 
    cardinal sin for a film of this type (The nudity only goes as far as 
    topless). Director/co-screenwriter Michael Hoffman Jr., using the 
    pseudonym &quot;Rex Kramer&quot;, has no idea how to build suspence 
    and the violence here is rather restrained. We do not see anyone 
    being killed, only seeing their bodies after they are murdered. All 
    in all, this film is nothing but a big goose-egg and should be 
    avoided at all costs. Even Reggie Bannister and Linnea Quigley look 
    bored beyond tears to be appearing in this piece of dreck, so why in 
    the Hell should you watch it? You shouldn't.;<A NAME="Expedition2004/2008"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="expedition_2008.htm">THE EXPEDITION</A></B> (2008) has a 
    copyright date of 2004, but wasn't released anywhere until 2008. That 
    right there&nbsp;is the reason why I usually do a little research 
    into a film before I watch it, but I didn't do that for this film. 
    Stupid me.&nbsp;Yes, this is another boring and overlong found 
    footage flick that runs 107 minutes (a loooong 107 minutes) and 
    doesn't offer the viewer anything in the way of entertainment. 
    Supposedly based on a true story, this &quot;film&quot; finds five 
    videographers/idiots entering a long-abandoned tuberculosis asylum/childrens
     hospital on Halloween Night and when the next day arrives, one of 
    them is missing...forever. We are then introduced to every small 
    detail the fab four go through to find their friend. The wraparound 
    footage finds a police detective questioning the four Einsteins 
    separately about what happened to their friend and then we are shown 
    their camera footage about their exploits. To say nothing happens is 
    a vast understatement, as there is no violence, blood, scares or 
    anything interesting going on in the entire running time (Did I 
    mention it was a loooong 107 minutes?).&nbsp;We know when ghosts are 
    present because their cameras go all static-y &amp; snowy every time 
    they are near and every once in a while we see a transparent girl 
    ghost running by the camera, but none of it amounts to anything. The 
    four friends hear their missing friend calling out for help, but they 
    cannot locate him. That's the entire film in a nutshell. This boring, 
    uneventful video production was directed/produced/written/photographed/edited/casted/production
     managed/KY jellied by Nigel Hartwell, who also stars as Nigel, the 
    leader of the group of brainded twenty-somethings. As a matter of 
    fact, nearly everyone here uses their real names in this film, except 
    for the police detective and a character known as &quot;The 
    Pathfinder&quot;, an outsider who has extensive knowledge of the 
    interior of the abandoned asylum. The only pathfinder I wanted to 
    meet was someone who could lead me out of this film. I have to watch 
    this shit so you don't have to, so please save your sanity and avoid 
    this like the plague.;<A NAME="S.N.U.B!2008"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B><A HREF="s.n.u.b._2008.htm">S.N.U.B!</A></B> 
    (2008) starts out on the right foot, but as the film progresses, the 
    left foot keeps tripping over the right.&nbsp;When a nuclear bomb is 
    found in the middle of London, a full-of-himself low-level 
    politician, Norman Chase (Jonathan Moore), receives a fax not meant 
    for him warning of a potential nuclear explosion, so he grabs a young 
    female American advisor, Marcia Grain (Alexandra Afryea, as 
    &quot;Claire Spence&quot;) and drive to the nearest S.N.U.B. (Secret 
    Nuclear Underground Bunker), where other people are also gathering, 
    including Lt. Sweeney (Gary Mavers), civilian Elaine (Harriet Thorpe, 
    the best thing about the film), her young son Jake (Ben Rowe) teenage 
    girls Tanya (Alice Henley) and Anna (Sara Lloyd Gregory), Sergeant 
    Jones (Tom Cotcher), who takes care of the base's air purification 
    system, slut Sophie (Magda Rodriguez), bicycle messenger Kevin (Danny 
    Tennant) and a few military personnel. When a Bomb Disposal Officer 
    cuts the wrong wire on the <A HREF="s.n.u.b._2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("159","212") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/s.n.u.b. 2008 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>nuclear
     device, it explodes, wiping out the city of London and everything 
    withing a 45 mile radius. The blast door to the Base is closed just 
    in the nick of time before the blast and radiation can kill or infect 
    everyone and everyone does their part (except Norman, who considers 
    himself the boss of everyone) to make sure that their extended stay 
    in the bunker is as pleasant as possible. After fifty minutes of 
    exposition (the film runs a scant 74 minutes), which plays like a 
    British soap opera (Sophie is fucking Elaine's husband; young Jake 
    tries to protect the guppy he brought with him from the black cat 
    inside the bunker; Norman hits on Marcia [who is black, like that 
    makes a difference], but she's more interested in Lt. Sweeney because 
    he knows what he is doing; one of the teenage girls hits on Kevin, 
    etc.), everyone begins hearing multiple knocks on the bunker's blast 
    door. Three military personnel are sent out in radiation suits to 
    check if help is coming (everything is on fire and the air is full of 
    burning ash), but when their screams are heard over the radio, 
    everyone knows they are dead, but what killed them? Also, someone or 
    something has come inside the bunker using the air ducts and begins 
    killing the survivors. When it is revealed that the intruders are 
    convicts from a nearby maximum security prison, where the worst of 
    the worst prisoners are kept, the film quickly ends after the unscary 
    convicts (who escaped from Death Row thanks to the blast, yet they 
    are mutating into homicidal monsters thanks to the radiation) kill a 
    few more survivors (including Sophie, the two teen girls and Kevin), 
    the rest escape in a helicopter (c'mon now!) to safety (after leaving 
    Norman behind for the mutants to kill). This awfully acted film was 
    at least slightly enjoyable (people can have fun with the terrible 
    acting) until it was revealed that the killers were prisoners. They 
    are introduced with absolutely zero scariness, as they just have 
    black makeup under their eyes, making them look like members of a 
    minstrel show or victims of the joke binoculars I purchased years ago 
    (I still have fun with them). The introduction of the helicopter 
    during the ending is one of the worst reveals in horror film history. 
    How would a helicopter survive the blast when everything around it is 
    on fire and choking ash is flying around everywhere? It's obviously 
    the only way screenwriters/producers John &amp; Peter Adams could 
    write themselves out of the corner they painted themselves in. To say 
    the finale is rushed and unbelievable is an understatement, as 
    director Jonathan Glendening (<B><A HREF="strippers_vs_werewolves_2012.htm">STRIPPERS
     VS. WEREWOLVES</A></B> - 2012) has no ideas how to pace a film, as 
    it's just one unrelated scene after the next, with no nudity or 
    bloody gore (the closest the gore comes is when one of the prisoners 
    is holding the decapitated head of one of the military personnel or 
    when the black cat finally eats Jake's guppy) to keep the viewer's 
    mind off how awful the film is. Even at 74 minutes, the film just 
    drags along, never seeming to go anywhere interesting. It would have 
    been better if the nuclear blast killed everyone in the cast 
    immediately or it caused some dormant monsters to awaken and attack 
    the bunker, but making the monsters prisoners was an exceptionally 
    cheap way to keep the film on budget, as all that had to be done was 
    dirty up their skin, tear their prison clothes to shreds and add 
    black makeup to their faces. I do a better job on myself every 
    Halloween. Simply avoid (or snub) this and do something else, like 
    giving your Uncle Cletus a hotfoot while he is napping on the couch. 
    Of course, IMDb gives the wrong year, once again, saying this is a 
    2010 production and all the review sites do the same thing, when the 
    end credits list it as a 2008 production. Hey guys, open your fucking eyes!</FONT></FONT></P>

    CGI creations. I could forgive all that if it weren't for the

    in this ridiculously rote SyFy Original Film, that's where. A 
    carnival travels to the said town, where the main attraction, the 
    Jersey Devil, gets loose and begins chowing down on the citizens. The 
    carnival owner (A.C. Peterson) tries to recapture his money-making 
    main attraction, while town sheriff Lou Diamond Phillips tries to 
    kill it. The CGI creature is terrible and so is this film; If you 
    want to know what James Corden did before he took over for Craig 
    Ferguson on <B>THE LATE, LATE SHOW</B> and hit it big with his 
    recurring bit &quot;Carpool Karaoke&quot;, check out <B><A HREF="lesbian_vampire_killers_2009.htm">LESBIAN
     VAMPIRE KILLERS</A></B> (2009) if you can stay awake while watching 
    it (much like his current late night gig, but for different reasons). 
    Corden and frequent comedy partner Mathew Horne star as two British 
    slackers who decide to take a trip to Horne's birthplace and manage 
    to make it to the small remote town, where centuries before, Vampire 
    Queen Carmilla (Silvia Colloca) was killed by a knight (played by 
    Horne) for turning his wife into a lesbian vampire. Before Carmilla 
    dies, she cursed the town and said she will return, but before she 
    did, every girl in the village that turns 18 will become lesbian 
    vampires (which is an easy excuse to frequently show female breasts). 
    The offscreen narrator says &quot;And then he cut her fucking head 
    off&quot; (which we see). The duo run into a female rock band whose 
    van has broken down and Horne becomes smitten with Lotte (MyAnna 
    Buring) one of the band members. Meanwhile, Corden meets the town 
    Vicar (Paul McGann), who hands Corden a sword (&quot;The Sword of 
    Dialdo&quot;) whose handle is shaped like a penis. The Vicar tells 
    him that it is the only weapon to kill Carmilla and Cordon tries it 
    out on a female vampire, who seems to explode in what looks like 
    gallons of male ejaculate. The rest of the film is filled with bad 
    jokes, more female nudity, exploding ejaculate-filled vampires (there 
    is hardly any blood in this film besides the beginning decapitation 
    and vampire bites) and a showdown at the end with a returned 
    Carmilla, who thinks Horne is the knight who killed her centuries 
    before. He ends up killing her again, by throwing the penis-handled 
    sword and hitting her directly in the heart. Corden, Horne and his 
    new love Lotte decide to become a trio of lesbian vampire killers as 
    they drive off into the sunset. First off, this isn't a badly made 
    film, it just isn't very funny (except for a couple of bits). 
    Director Phil Claydon (<B><A HREF="alone_2002.htm">ALONE</A></B> - 
    2002) gets the atmosphere down correctly, but the screenplay, by 
    Stewart Williams &amp; Paul Hupfield, offers him very little to work

    strapped to his helmet) goes out and fights crime. He learns his 
    lesson that bullets (he's also anti-gun and refuses to carry one) are 
    stronger than any weapon he can come up with. Too many long stretches

     is a disappointing serial killer flick about a recently reinstated 
    FBI profiler (Mark Thompson, who also wrote this mess), who had 
    severe psychological problems for ten years because of the job, 
    trying to find the serial killer who resurfaced from his past and he 
    was not able to catch (and put him in a mental psychosis for nearly 
    ten years). Not even the presence of actors Jere Burns, Kevin Pollak, 
    Mark Pellegrino, Teri Polo, Dwight Yoakam, and Ken Howard can save 
    director Charles Adelman's (no relation) thriller because the 
    timeline is all screwed up, thanks to Thompson's confusing 
    screenplay. Flashbacks show the killer to be an older person to 
    Thompson's younger FBI profiler, but when he is caught, he is a good 
    ten years younger than Thompson. I don't know if Thompson was trying 
    to make some sort of statement (like maybe Thompson was seeing the 
    serial killer through his younger eyes), but the message is lost in a 
    sea of inaccuracies. If you like being confused by a movie, this one 
    is for you; <B><A HREF="prowl_2009.htm">PROWL</A></B> (2009) was one

    several horror films picked for a limited theatrical showing in 
    January 2011 and this U.K./Bulgaria (filmed there) production is 
    nothing but ordinary. A bunch of young adults travel to the big city 
    to look for an apartment for a female friend, when their car breaks 
    down in the middle of nowhere (surprise, surprise). They accept a 
    ride from a big rig driver as long as they all ride in the back in 
    the trailer (always a good idea). They all find themselves trapped in 
    a combination slaughterhouse/auto junkyard (what??) swarming with 
    feral people who love to chew on human flesh and drink their blood. 
    They are all under the control of a woman named Veronica (Saxon 
    Trainor), who is raising a group of cannibal &quot;hunters&quot; 
    because of something that happened in her childhood (it is not quite 
    spelled out completely). After all the male members of the new group 
    have been dispatched, the &quot;hunters&quot; go after the women and 
    every attack is filmed with that aggravating shaken camera syndrome 
    where we can make out nothing of what is going on. The point of this 
    whole film is that one of the females in the new group may be just 
    the kind of cannibal &quot;hunter&quot; Veronica is looking for, and 
    when she escapes with a wounded girlfriend, Veronica tells her 
    hunters not to go after her because, &quot;She'll be back.&quot; That 
    may be true when she takes a bite out of the neck of a hobo who tries

    unseen killer. When the film opens, the police find one surviving 
    girl named Jenna (Haylie Duff), who relates the story to them in

    accidentally killed by these kids a year earlier and the

    (2008). Thankfully, this isn't a found footage film (I hate those 
    with a passion, except for a few that know how to use the medium), 
    but that's where the thanks end. Costner plays a recently divorced 
    father, who moves his young son and troubled teenage daughter Louisa 
    (Ivana Baquero) to a house with plenty of property in South Carolina. 
    What Costner is unaware of is that the property containts a tribe of 
    &quot;mound walkers&quot; an ancient monster-like group of males who 
    need a woman to mate with. Guess who they pick? The monsters are 
    shown fairly early in the film, so most of the suspense is destroyed 
    before the film is half over. The ambiguous ending, where Costner 
    blows up the mound to save his daughter only to turn into one of the 
    mound people (maybe; I did say it was ambiguous) leaves the film open 
    for a sequel that will never get made because this was supposed to be 
    a theatrical film and the company suits took one look at it and 
    dumped it onto DVD and Blu-Ray a couple of years later. They gave the

    ancient bark of a tree and finds herself in a different dimension 
    where a vampire hopes to use her to cross over into our dimension.

    anybody (She gives Chad a blowjob and then immediately tells Allie, 
    only to be told by Allie, &quot;I'm not his girlfriend!&quot;). At 
    least we see her die and her eyes poked out! Other than that, the 
    film has some gaping errors, such as the asylum still having 
    electricity, just so Stewart can get the asylum's security camera 
    working (once again, really?). This is a film where people do the 
    stupidest things imaginable, like splitting up when staying as a 
    group would be much safer, just so they can get killed (We never see 
    the man in black removing anyone's eyes, but we see the bodies of the

    purchase another camera. Clarissa demands that she can do it by 
    herself, so while the other six college brainiacs drink beer and go 
    to a disco, Clarissa find an antique shop where the proprietor, 
    Tollinger (a top-billed Armand Assante; <B><A HREF="judge_dredd_1995.htm">JUDGE
     DREDD</A></B> - 1995: who is in the film for no longer than five 
    minutes), who we saw in the beginning of the film as a police 
    forensic photographer taking photos of a young girl who was viciously 
    murdered, hands Clarissa an old, but valuable, Polaroid Instant 
    Camera from 1966, saying it will cost her twenty Euros. Clarissa 
    jumps at the chance since it is worth ten times that amount and 
    Tollinger even throws in a cartridge of film for free. When she 
    returns to her braindead friends, she takes a photo of spoiled rich 
    girl Geneva (Tara Haggiag), who decides she doesn't want to camp out 
    in the mountains and leaves for the train station to take her back 
    home. She doesn't tell anyone she is leaving except for ex-boyfriend 
    Tommy (Antonio Cupo), who is the asshole of the group. We then see 
    Geneva go to the train station, where she is killed by a flying metal 
    spike to her head (only implied, not shown). Once arriving at the 
    Atlas Mountains, Paul (Robert Capelli Jr.), who has a thing for 
    Clarissa, leads the way as they walk tp a camping site, but he gets 
    everyone hopelessly lost and there is no cellphone service (an 
    overused trope in modern day horror flicks). Asshole Tommy splits 
    from the group, only to be captured by a Hunter (Rabie Kati) who is 
    skinning a deer he just shot and killed. Paul talks the Hunter into 
    letting Tommy go (I would rather the Hunter killed him), telling him 
    that they are hopelessly lost, so the Hunter tells them they can stay 
    at his campsite for the night (after scumbag Tommy secretly takes a 
    photo of him with Clarissa's new/old camera). When they all are at 
    the Hunter's camp, he sees the camera and tells Clarissa that it is 
    cursed and he will kill her if she takes a photo of him with it (not 
    knowing that Tommy already did). He knows all about Tollinger and his 
    antique shop, but how? The next morning everyone hears the Hunter 
    screaming and they find him dead, his skull impaled by several deer 
    antlers (the best thing about this tepid film). Local students 
    Jameela (Giorgia Massetti) and Rasheed (Mourad Zaoui) then 
    &quot;borrow&quot; Clarissa's camera to take a selfie of themselves. 
    Uh, oh! I bet we can guess what happens next. That's right, they both 
    die horrible deaths (Rasheed is burned to a crisp in a matter of 
    seconds and Jameela is nearly beheaded with a shovel.) Jackass Tommy 
    then takes a photo of Angelica (Manuela Zanier) and later on, when 
    what's left of the idiots find an empty cabin in the woods, she is 
    killed when a tree branch impales her through the throat. The 
    remaining three dimwits finally come to the realization that it is 
    the camera that is causing the deaths of their friends. They are 
    killed by whatever is in their photo (The Hunter was skinng a deer 
    when his photo was taken, Jameela was holding a shovel in her photo 
    with Rasheed, who was holding a lighter, Angelica's photo had trees 
    in the background). Fuckhead Tommy doesn't believe what he is hearing 
    and tries to take a photo of Clarissa and Paul, but he manages to 
    take a photo of himself when Paul fights him. The cabin catches on 
    fire during the fight and Tommy burns to death (his photo had an oil 
    lamp in it). Somehow, Clarissa and Paul easily find their way back to 
    the Range Rover, which is parked next to a graveyard. They discover 
    that the Hunter is buried there, as he actually died in 1966. Also 
    buried there is the little girl Clarissa saw in the antique shop 
    (where we now see she missing most of her scalp in the back of her 
    head, exposing her brain), as<A HREF="smile_2009.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("149","213") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/smile 2009 tubi poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    well as Tollinger and they also died in 1966. When they drive away, 
    Clarissa finally gets an internet connection to a laptop and 
    discovers that Tollinger was not only a forensic photographer, the 
    murdered little girl he was taking a photo of with his Polaroid in 
    the beginning of the film was actually his daughter. Tollinger went 
    crazy (his wife committed suicide due to the murder of their 
    daughter) and began killing people, beginning with the Hunter (We see 
    him thrust antlers into the Hunter's head), and taking their photo. 
    He is fired from his job as a police photographer and spends the rest 
    of his time at a cabin in the woods, the same cabin that burned down, 
    finally killing himself by hanging in 1966. Clarissa then begins 
    taking photos of nothing&nbsp; so the camera's film can do harm to no 
    one, but the last photo in the cartridge is taken of a car passing 
    by. When the photo develops, we can see Clarissa and Paul's 
    reflection in the car's window. We then see the POV of a car speeding 
    in their direction, which hits and kills them (offscreen), as we 
    watch Tollinger put the Polaroid camera in the antique store window, 
    waiting for the next victim to purchase it. <FONT COLOR="MAROON">THE END</FONT>.
     This very sloppy horror film, directed and written by Francesco 
    Gasperoni, whose only other credit (at the time of this review) is 
    directing/co-writing (with Harriet MacMasters-Green) the thriller <B><A HREF="parking_lot_2011.htm">PARKING
     LOT</A></B> (2011), is nothing but bad acting and violence that is 
    not very graphic; the most graphic thing we see is the Hunter's head 
    impaled with antlers and a tree branch sticking out of Angelica's 
    throat. The absolute worst thing about this film is Antonio Cupo as 
    Tommy, who overplays his role to the point he becomes a joke, as he 
    does and says the most asinine things (such as pretending to be dead 
    in the forest, only to jump out at his friends), you'll wonder why 
    anyone would want him as a friend. Rather than saying any more, I'll 
    end it by saying modern-day Italian horror films are more miss than 
    hit and this one misses by a New York mile. Also known as <B><A HREF="smile_2009.htm#DestinationDeath">DESTINATION

    because of something that happened during Paul's college days and the 
    appearance of &quot;The Man&quot; (Afemo Omilami), who seems to know 
    everything about Paul's life and the choices he has made. The ending 
    is truly a head-scratcher and doesn't help one bit in explaining

    is dying of a rare disease) circuit, which contains even more MMA 
    fighters, in order to cancel his ex-girlfriend's gambling debts. 
    Bonnar is a good fighter, but as an actor, he speaks his lines in 
    monotone (his stabs at comedy are wince-inducing) and he has a facial 
    expression like he is taking a crap in his pants. Even when the final 
    third of the film turns into a <B><A HREF="most_dangerous_game_1932.htm">MOST
     DANGEROUS GAME</A></B> (1932) scenario, the action is lame

    (2010) is a shopworn tale of two psychopaths (Brian Geraghty and 
    Tricia Helfer, who may be an incestuous brother and sister killing 
    team) who enter the open house of a woman (Rachel Blanchard), who is 
    selling her house after getting divorced, and make themselves at 
    home. The female psycho wants the divorced woman to be killed, but 
    the psycho man (who likes to videotape the murders for sexual 
    reasons) keeps the divorced woman in the basement (he likes her) 
    without the knowledge of the psycho woman. They kill a bunch of 
    people (usually with a butcher knife) and move on to the next open 
    house when the psycho woman discovers the divorced woman in the 
    basement and kills her. We are given no motivation as to why these 
    two psychos do what they do and I just hate these nihilistic endings 
    that are cyclic. Freshman director Andrew Paquin gets younger sister 
    Anna Paquin and brother-in-law Stephen Moyer (both star in <B><A HREF="true_blood_cable_series.htm">TRUE

    (2010). I'm a huge fan of Australian horror films, but this one would 
    try the patience of a saint. After a pretty good opening which spans 
    12,000 years, the film turns into one of those &quot;group of young 
    adults trapped in the woods with a monster&quot; scenarios (this time 
    it's in the Outback), with the cliched cast of typecasted people 
    (hunk, jokester, sexpot, girl with deep secret, etc.). While there is 
    a fair amount of gory deaths (and people with huge pointy teeth), the 
    final twenty minutes, which takes place in a cave, contains some of 
    the dodgiest CGI I have seen since a SyFy Original Film. It actually 
    ruins the film that preceeded it; <B><A HREF="grey_skies_2010.htm">GREY

    house in the woods. A bunch of college buddies (including the 
    prerequisite gay man) hold a reunion at the said house and are 
    abducted one by one and possessed (or replaced) by the aliens. No one 
    seems to notice (the possessed have blackened eyes and pale skin, so 
    it would be pretty hard to miss them!) until it is too late and the 
    downbeat finale has all the possessed people (including a pregnant 
    female) leaving the house and heading back to civilization. God knows 
    what will happen next, but I was bored to tears; <B><A HREF="sheltered_2010.htm">SHELTERED</A></B> 
    (2010) is about a bunch of friends stranded during a bad

    offers his nearby house as shelter. Oh, boy, I think we can all see 
    where this is leading. Once at the house, the group discover Joey is 
    a cleanliness freak and meet his drug-addled brother Billy (Manoel 
    Hudec). It's not long before the friends begin being murdered in 
    various bloody ways. There's no surprise who the killer is, because 
    at the beginning of the film, we watch Joey kill a man and hide the 
    body. So what's the point?; <B><A HREF="devils_playground_2010.htm">DEVIL'S
     PLAYGROUND</A></B> (2010), a typical British &quot;zombie horde on 
    the loose&quot; film (it is gory and stars Craig Fairbrass [one of my 
    favorites], but it's still a bitter disappointment) that offers 
    nothing new to the zombie genre. That's the problem with DTV zombie 
    films. They may be gory, but they follow the same old formula. If

    go out to investigate bear attacks, only to discover that the 
    killings were perpetrated by trolls, but the shakey camerawork and 
    Norwegian traditions (The trolls can smell Christians? What the hell 
    does that mean? Christians stink?) lost me. The special effects are 
    great (especially the giant troll), but as you know, it takes more 
    than great effects to make a good film. Hollywood is in the midst of 
    remaking this film. Surprised?; <B><A HREF="rig_2010.htm">THE RIG</A></B> 
    (2010), another in a long line of terrible &quot;monster on the loose

    worker tells a Puerto Rican female crew member that it looks like a 
    &quot;chupacabra&quot;!) is unleashed because of drilling and 
    terrorizes and kills members of an oil rig. What follows is the same 
    old, same old: the creature chasing the members around the corridors 
    of the oil rig and slaughtering them until the hero (who wanted off 
    the rig because his brother works on it) comes up with a solution to

    though it has sizeable roles for Terry Kiser and Michael Berryman. I 
    hate these DTV films where the heroine seemingly gets away (Why did 
    she stop the car to cry anyway? She could have driven the car at

     MIAMI</A></B>'s Adam Rodriguez, but co-star/co-producer Curtis 
    &quot;50 Cent&quot; Jackson ruins much of the film when he appears in 
    it (He really needs an acting coach!). The film opens with cop 
    partners Rodriguez and Chris Klein with informant Tino (Jackson) in 
    the back seat on the way to the site of a cop killer sighting and a 
    shootout ensues, where the cop killer and Tino are killed. The only 
    other eye witness to the cop shooting is suspiciously shot dead and 
    then Rodriguez and Klein are put in the box and interrogated 
    separately. They tell in flashback how everything went down and 
    Rodriguez knows that someone in the police department is dirty and 
    ends up losing his job over the accusations, being railroaded into 
    the shooting of the last eyewitness. Klein goes about proving 
    Rodriguez's innocence, but it is obvious someone in the police force 
    and the local gangs don't want him to find out the truth. Meanwhile, 
    we find out that Rodriguez is actually guilty of the charges and, 
    with the help of corrupt Captain Emmett (Richard T. Jones), hopes to 
    escape to Canada with a bag full of drug money. Klein puts 
    two-and-two together and corners Rodriguez in a warehouse, where he 
    shoots Rodriguez dead (after pumping a few bullets into Captain 
    Emmett). But is someone else in the department also dirty? There's 
    not much to recommend here; just a few shootouts and not much else. 
    Filmed in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Not badly made, but that is not an 
    endorsement. Brian A. Miller makes competent films, just not 
    involving ones; Speaking of Curtis &quot;50 Cent&quot; Jackson, he 
    not only stars in the film <B><A HREF="gun_2010.htm">GUN</A></B> 
    (2010), he also wrote it, too. It's a standard revenge tale, where 
    Jackson plays a take-no-prisoners gun runner who kills Val Kilmer's 
    wife, who is caught in the middle of a shootout between two rival 
    gangs, one headed by Jackson. Police detective James Remar turns 
    Kilmer into a confidential informant to infiltrate Jackson's gang and 
    he does such a good job, that Jackson makes him his right hand man. 
    The question remains: Is Kilmer getting too involved in the gun 
    running operation and enjoying the power (giving Remar false 
    information) or is he planning an execution of his own? Besides a 
    good shootout at the end, the film is full of Jackson's patented bad 
    acting and Kilmer acts like he is high on heroin the entire film. Add 
    to that a tacked-on happy ending and director Jesse Terrero (a 50 
    Cent music video director who also directed the film <B><A HREF="soul_plane_2004.htm">SOUL
     PLANE</A></B> - 2004) comes up with an action film we have seen a 
    hundred times before. Seriously, if Curtis Jackson wants to continue 
    acting, I would heartedly recommend a good acting coach. He has also 
    appeared with Kilmer in the films <B><A HREF="streets_of_blood_2009.htm">STREETS

    worst film of director John Carpenter's career and for many reasons. 
    It's his first film shot on digital video and it shows. Scenes are 
    muddy and, when sequences don't look like they have been drained of 
    all color, they have the flat look of a TV movie. The screenplay, by 
    brothers Michael &amp; Shawn Rasmussen, is full of contrivances and 
    cliches and the biggest mystery of all is why the hell Carpenter 
    would even touch this material. In 1966, a young woman named Kristen 
    (Amber Heard; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#AllBoysMandy2006">ALL THE 
    BOYS LOVE MANDY LANE</A></B> - 2006) is committed to a mental 
    institution run by the seemingly sinister Dr. Stringer (Jared Harris; 
    the best thing about this film) and before you can say &quot;Haven't 
    I seen this film before and done much better?&quot;, patients begin 
    disappearing from the institution. Kristen seems to think that an 
    evil supernatural spirit is making these patients disappear and is 
    out to kill her, but it is quite apparent almost from the beginning 
    that Kristen is in this institution for a reason, as she is harboring 
    some dark secret from her past that she managed to wipe from her 
    memory. In the finale, that dark secret is uncovered and things seem 
    wrapped-up in a tidy manner, but the writers do a cheat on the 
    audience in the final closing shot that will infuriate them if they 
    have half a brain in their head. Even the acting talents of Danielle 
    Panabaker (<B><A HREF="crazies_2009.htm">THE CRAZIES</A></B> - 2009) 
    and Meryl Streep's daughter Mamie Gummer can't save this film from 
    being a total failure. The only positive thing I can say about this 
    film is the use of the song &quot;Run Baby Run (Back Into My 
    Arms)&quot; by The Newbeats in one scene where the female patients 
    dance to it. Otherwise, there is a reason why this film went straight 
    to DTV. Let's hope that John Carpenter decides to do a better film

    - 2003) idea of an action film and it is pretty terrible. He hires 
    not one, but two, professional wrestlers, Rob Van Dam and Dave 
    Bautista (neither who can act) and a whole lotta rap stars (including 
    Ja Rule, Omarion Grandberry and Qwes), to make this film more 
    action-packed, but the fact is that DeFalco doesn't know how to 
    handle action and the film is beyond deplorable. Van Dam plays a war 
    hero (who has a limp that comes and goes) who is wanted for the 
    murder of a drug kingpin's son (who tried to rape Van Dam's wife) and 
    he and his wife, daughter and a couple of interracial friends must 
    stay one step ahead of the kingpin, a crooked police detective and 
    some highly muscled goons (one played by DeFalco himself). When Van 
    Dam's daughter is kidnapped, he pulls a bullet out of his shoulder 
    (from a previous fight with a chain-wielding motorcycle rider), 
    injects his ass with something (probably steroids) and goes 
    Terminator on the bad guys' asses with minimal help from Bautista 
    (whose role is really nothing but an extended cameo) while heavy 
    metal and rap music plays on the soundtrack. If you want to see how 
    not to make an action film, this is the one to watch. Filmed in Baton

     BUCKS COUNTY MASSACRE</A></B> (2010) is a found footage film that 
    contains everything I hate about found footage flicks, namely 
    constant herky-jerky shaky-cam photography, the camera being pointed 
    away from the action at the most inconvenient times and that sickly 
    green night vision mode photography that is supposed to show you 
    things happening in the dark, but fails to do so. The opening of this 
    film is just like most other found footage flicks. A scrawl on the 
    screen says &quot;Based on a True Story&quot; and then tells us that 
    this footage was found by the police, who gave it to an editor to 
    make a complete timeline-based evidence story. That's bullshit and 
    I'll tell you why. The film takes place in the real Bucks County in 
    Pennsylvania, where a bunch of stupid twenty-somethings gather in a 
    cabin in the middle of the woods to celebrate the 25th birthday of 
    Will (Zackary Kresser). One of the girls goes missing when the female 
    owner of the cabin, Kelly (Nikki Bell), tells her she can only make 
    cell phone calls if she walks to the side of the house and goes 
    twenty feet into the woods (Fuckin'really??), since the cabin has no 
    land line. The girl's drunk boyfriend (whom I call &quot;The Jaw&quot;
     due to his protruding chin) goes looking for her when she doesn't return,<A HREF="bucks_county_massacre_2010.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bucks county massacre poster3a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="155" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    finding her cell phone at the edge of the woods. The group calls the 
    police, who are about as helpful as tits on a pig, and they tell the 
    group that the girl is of legal age and they can't search for her for 
    at least 24 hours. The drunk boyfriend goes berserk, breaking into 
    the cabin's rifle cabinet, grabbing a shotgun and heading out to the 
    woods alone. The other men decide to go looking for him, hear a 
    shotgun blast and find the boyfriend's body torn apart, as if it were 
    eaten. Something jumps out of a tree and grabs one of the men, who 
    screams and dies after this human-like &quot;creature&quot; (which is 
    how the end credits describe him) tears him apart with his teeth. 
    Guess what? That's right, someone videotaped the whole thing and when 
    they return to the cabin, they play the footage and all the girls 
    begin screaming uncontrollably (it's headache-inducing). One of the 
    men is a limping ex-military man who took shrapnel in his leg from a 
    bomb in Afghanistan, so you think he would be the hero of the film, 
    right? Think again, as the creature invades the house and kills 
    everyone, except for a young woman who has leukemia and is going 
    through chemotherapy. A detective and an F.B.I. agent question this 
    woman throughout the film, trying to find out why she was the only 
    person to survive this massacre. My guess is that the 
    &quot;creature&quot; was a cannibal and didn't eat this woman because 
    he smelled she had cancer, but the two lawmen are so stupid and 
    vapid, they couldn't see their nose on their face, even when looking 
    in a mirror. There's nothing in this film that is worthwhile, as we 
    never get a good look at the &quot;creature&quot; (I freeze-framed 
    one sequence and as far as I could tell the creature looked like 
    &quot;Three Fingers&quot; in those <B><A HREF="wrong_turn_franchise_2003-2014.htm">WRONG
     TURN</A></B> films), but the film fails to mention who or what they 
    are, leaving it up to the viewer to come up with their own 
    conclusions. That's just lazy filmmaking. The majority of the film is 
    footage of everyone walking in the woods, so all we see are trees and 
    weeds, most of it in night vision mode and really shaky. The acting 
    is either over the top (&quot;The Jaw&quot;) or non-existant 
    (everyone else), so it's hard to root for anyone. A total failure 
    from the beginning, so it shouldn't surprise you that this film won 
    awards at film festivals you never heard of. 
    Director/producer/screenwriter/professional ass-wiper Jason Sherman 
    has made a film containing every found footage clich&eacute; that I 
    hate with a passion. I can't think of one redeeming thing to say 
    about it, so I'll end the review here. <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">NOTE:</FONT></B> 
    Even though this film is a fraud, a real-life massacre did take place 
    in Bucks County, PA in 2017, where four male teenagers were 
    slaughtered on a farm by two young men, one of the killers being 
    mentally retarded. That story trumps this film in so many ways, I 
    can't begin to describe it!;<A NAME="Backlight2010"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B><A HREF="backlight_2010.htm">BACKLIGHT</A></B> 
    (2010) asks the question: What do electronic gizmos like a 
    malfunctioning car GPS system, a broken cell phone and a digital 
    camera, have to do with saving the lives of three people? Well, in 
    this anthology film, where three separate stories collide together in 
    the finale, it has everything to do with it. This starts out as a 
    very remarkable film, but by the time the third story comes around, 
    you'll be looking for the film to end quickly and quietly, which it 
    doesn't. In the first story, widower Jay (Joaquim de Almeida), who 
    lost his wife on his birthday a year earlier, is so distressed that 
    his friends worry about him. Before his wife died, she gave him a 
    gift which he has yet to open, so his friends give him a gift on his 
    birthday, a pair of scissors, telling him to cut the ribbon on his 
    wife's present and get on with his life. Jay does just that and 
    inside the box is a car GPS system, but it doesn't seem to work. Jay 
    then drives into the middle of the desert, puts a gun under his chin 
    and as he is about to pull the <A HREF="backlight_2010.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/backlight poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>trigger,
     the GPS system comes on, telling him he is not at his destination 
    yet, so he gets back in his car and drives to his destination, which 
    turns out to be a road where a young unnamed mother (Michelle Mania) 
    is being pulled by her neck by a scarf that is jammed in a car door 
    that is traveling driverless down to a nearby lake. We then go back 
    one day and discover the story about the mother and her teenage 
    daughter Lucy (Skyler Day), who has found a broken cell phone that 
    tells her one word a day, such as &quot;window&quot;, 
    &quot;hand&quot;, &quot;king&quot; and &quot;air&quot;, which is the 
    final word, all which saves Lucy's life in one way or another (Such 
    as Lucy nearly getting shot by a motorcycle thug, who trips and falls 
    when he steps on a &quot;King&quot; chess piece). The mother, who at 
    first thinks her daughter is crazy, comes around to realize that the 
    phone is actually saving her daughter's life and the last word Lucy 
    receives takes the pair to the road where Jay sees the mother being 
    choked by her scarf as her car rolls down the road and into the lake. 
    Lucy, who is nowhere near the car, watches as a young man named 
    Daniel (Joey Hagler) jumps into the lake off a rowboat, a knapsack 
    containing rocks wrapped around his neck. Lucy jumps in to save him 
    and then we go back one day to live Daniel's story and why he is 
    committing suicide. Daniel is a patient at a mental hospital who has 
    escaped. He believes his digital camera has the power to travel back 
    in time to save the girl he loved from dying. His female psychiatrist 
    sends her brother Matt (Scott Bailey), an EMT doctor whose girlfriend 
    disappeared a few years ago, to &quot;save&quot; Daniel from himself, 
    but Matt soon believes that Daniel's camera does, indeed, have the 
    power to travel back in time. Long story short, Daniel ends up in the 
    lake, taking photos of himself and the people who gave him a ride 
    ride while hitchhiking. In the film's finale, Jay saves Lucy's mother 
    from certain death, using the scissors he recieved to cut the scarf 
    and save her just before the car plunges into the lake. It turns out 
    Daniel is the one who saves Lucy from drowning, carrying her to shore 
    and giving her CPR (the &quot;air&quot; of the final word) and 
    bringing her back to life. Jay found someone to love in Lucy's 
    mother, Daniel found someone to love in Lucy and when Daniel gives 
    Matt the phone, one of the pictures on it is his girlfriend who 
    disappeared years ago, who is now a tow truck driver. He calls the 
    number on the side of the truck and just when he thinks he is going 
    to have his girlfriend back, Matt is stung by a bee, which he is 
    deadly allergic to. He reaches for his EPI-pen, but realizes he used 
    it on an old man named Justin Tyme (Donovan Scott), who was one of 
    the people who picked up Daniel hitchhiking (the old man had a rubber 
    allergy and he nearly died at a roadside gas station when he blew up 
    a balloon for a young girl, until Matt stuck him with the EPI-pen). 
    Matt dies on the dock of the lake, never getting to see his 
    girlfriend again. Lovely, right? I really wanted to like this film 
    until the final story, which just dragged on. Director/screenwriter 
    Fernando Fragata, who also photographed this Portugal/USA 
    co-production, has a way with beautiful landscapes (such as the 
    Airplane Graveyard in the Mojave Desert in California), giving this 
    film a real slick look, but some of the coincidences in this film are 
    very hard to believe. Sure, everything connects in the finale, but 
    why did it have to end on such a down note? I'm afraid I cannot 
    recommend this film due to the final story and the downbeat 
    conclusion, but others may like it more than I did. Proceed at your 
    own risk. Available on Amazon Prime, Tubi and on YouTube on channel 
    &quot;Movie Central&quot; (at the time of this review).;<A NAME="LizardBoy2010"></A>

    (2010; re-edited and revised in 2020) should tell you what you are in 
    for, and I guarantee it's not a good time. Widowed geneticist Dr. 
    Gino Conti (Pete Punito), whose fiancee dumped him because his sperm 
    count was too low (!), secretely splices the genes from a rhesus 
    monkey and a lizard to create a new lifeform, the titled creature, 
    whom he names Carlo (played by two people, Steven Zeigler and 
    Director/Co-Screenwriter&nbsp; Paul Della Pelle) and adopts as his 
    son. The only problem is, when Carlo reaches maturity, he craves 
    human flesh and blood, so Gino has to lock him in his bedroom. While 
    Gino is smoking a joint with his friends in his living room, Carlo 
    escapes from his room and tears the head off of one of Gino's friends 
    and eats it, forcing Gino to yell at Carlo to get back to his room, 
    which he does. Since this is a so-called<A HREF="lizard_boy_2010-2020.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("143","213") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/lizard boy poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    horror comedy. Gino and the rest of his friends say that their dead 
    friend was an asshole anyway and dispose of his headless body, nobody 
    questioning why Gino has a Lizard Boy locked in his house. Long story 
    short, Carlo escapes and begins murdering the citizens of this sleepy 
    town, as the town's useless overweight Sheriff Johnson (Bruce Brown) 
    and his even more useless Deputy Bobby Thomas (Justin Bonaccorso) try 
    to find the &quot;wild animal&quot; that is killing the populace. 
    This attracts the interest of two black ops goverment agents, the 
    dastardly Agent Hoffmeyer (Damon Gregory) and the equally violent 
    Agent Mendoza (Domiziano Arcangeli), who want to capture Carlo and 
    experiment on him in a secret government lab. Female scientist 
    Margaret Pennylily (Serena Lorien) discovers what Gino has created 
    and falls in love with him, offering to help him capture Carlo and 
    protect him. We then discover that Carlo is not a new creation at 
    all, but actually the son Gino had with his dead wife, who was 
    suffering from a deadly disease, so Gino injected him with the serum 
    in hopes of saving him, which he does, but turns him into the deadly 
    Lizard Boy (this would explain why Carlo talks!). Can Gino save his 
    son from Agents Hoffmeyer and Mendoza or will everyone die instead? 
    Do you really care? I didn't. First of all, Carlo the Lizard Boy is a 
    ridiculous creation He has a fairly human body, a lizard's head, 
    claws for hands and a very long lizard tail, which is a combination 
    of practical effects and CGI. You can't help but laugh every time you 
    see him, but I dare you not to bust a gut when he jumps from a tree 
    and flies through the air, killing one of Agent Hoffmeyer's minions, 
    who has captured Gino and Margaret and placed them in a van. But the 
    most outrageous scene has to be where Carlo and Agent Mendoza get 
    into a martial arts fight (!), karate chopping and kicking each other 
    like they were experts (and it's filmed poorly). Now I can understand 
    Mendoza being an accomplished martial artist, but where did Carlo 
    learn it, by watching TV? The whole film is just as ridiculous and 
    the comedy elements fall flatter than pancakes made with decades-old 
    batter. The fact that this film was re-edited and CGI added to the 
    Lizard Boy's tail and mouth (it expands to eat heads and other body 
    parts) in 2020 is just as mystifying because it adds nothing to the 
    film (This is the version I saw. I honestly can't watch the original 
    version, because if the 2020 version is this bad, how good could the 
    original version be?). Director/Producer/Editor Paul Della Pelle 
    (this is his only feature film), who co-wrote the screenplay with 
    Sheriff Johnson actor Bruce Brown, has no sense of pacing, as the 
    film just meanders along at a stifling pace and nothing really 
    happens throughout the film. The &quot;surprise&quot; ending is also 
    just as boring (Margaret gets pregnant with Gino's baby and discovers 
    during a pre-natal exam that her unborn baby has a long tail. It 
    doesn't make any sense at all!). Not even good for an unintentional 
    laugh (besides the scenes I mentioned, but it is still not worth your 
    time). Skip it and keep your sanity, so you can lose it on a much 
    better film. Available streaming on YouTube, Amazon Prime and Tubi at 
    the time this review was written (July 2021).</FONT></FONT></P>

     RETURNED</A></B> - 2013) that is just another exorcism tale but with 
    a small twist. 15 year-old Emma (Sophie Vavasseur) begins having 
    strange hallucinations, like a mound of cockroaches spilling out the 
    toilet and other strange phenomena, so her parents send her to a 
    psychiatrist, who dies of a heart attack during their first session. 
    Emma's parents then call on her Uncle Christopher (Stephen 
    Billington), who happens to be a priest who performed an unsanctioned 
    exorcism which the Church refused recognize as real (one of the 
    Church elders is played by Pinhead himself, Doug Bradley). 
    Christopher begins the exorcism, but things only get worse as Emma 
    tries to drown her younger brother in the bathtub, causes the death 
    of her best friend by grabbing a hold of his steering wheel and 
    crashing the car into a tree and Emma's mother stabbing herself in 
    the stomach with scissors, sending her to the hospital with serious 
    injuries. To make a long story short, Christopher wasn't actually 
    performing an exorcism at all. He was bringing the demon out in the 
    open (he videotapes everything, but this is not a found footage film) 
    to possess Emma to prove to the Church that his last exorcism was 
    real! Besides the unexpected ending and one really good shot of the 
    demon leaving Emma's body (blink and you'll miss it, though), this is

    January 2011. This one is a bad horror flick about six cliched people 
    kidnapped off the road, have pig masks put on their heads (the 
    kidnappers wear clown masks) and taken to an abandoned prison where 
    strange things happened in the past. Yes, they are part of a reality

    face their worst fears (and win even more money if they all complete 
    their tasks), while the female producer and her crew watch the action

    picking off the contestants (and the crew) in various bloody ways, 
    which begins to worry the female producer (duh!), because none of it 
    was in the script (she calls up the owner of the show just to make 
    sure he didn't add anything special to the proceedings that she 
    didn't know about). Long story short, this whole enterprise was

    film <B><A HREF="dead_2010.htm">THE DEAD</A></B> (2010), I must admit 
    I was highly disappointed with the final product. The only really 
    good things in this film's favor are the filming in Africa (Burkina 
    Faso and Ghana) and some top-notch physical gore effects. Otherwise, 
    the story is similar to just about every other serious zombie film 
    out there. The plot is simple, Lieutenant Brian Murphy (Rob Freeman, 
    who caught malaria while filming), a lone survivor of a plane crash, 
    washes ashore in Africa and must battle a horde of zombies that roam 
    the countryside. Along the way, he saves people and loses them due to

    zombies, only to learn that there is no safe place in the world in 
    the finale. Directed capably by The Ford Brothers (Howard and 
    Jonathan) with a minimal budget, the location scenery and effects 
    (some using actual African amputees) are what catches your eye.

    month considered a dumping ground for bad films, with the studio (in 
    this case, Warner Bros.) hoping to recoup some of its financial 
    losses. Of course, it bombed, and rightfully so. This extremely slow 
    (and supposedly true) film about exorcisms concerns young seminary 
    student Michael (Colin O'Donoghue) beginning to doubt his beliefs 
    (Don't they all?), who is sent to Rome to study exorcisms with Father 
    Lucas (Anthony Hopkins, who has never been worse). The Church hopes 
    to have an exorcist at every diocese (Maybe to flush the Devil from 
    pedophile priests?) and disbelieving Michael (who believes psychiatry 
    is the answer) begins to experience things he can't explain, like 
    talking to his father on the phone, even though he died earlier in 
    the morning. This overlong and patience-trying PG-13 horror film 
    culminates when Father Lucas becomes possessed (You can tell he's 
    possessed because he calls Michael &quot;dude&quot;!) and it is up to 
    Michael to cast the demons out of him. I wish someone would cast the

    (2010) is a film that pushes the &quot;ick&quot; factor up to 11. 
    While on a road trip, Rebecca (Eva Green) asks her husband Thomas 
    (Matt Smith) to pull over to the side of the road because she has to 
    pee. While she is walking through a field to tinkle, Thomas is hit by 
    another car and killed. Rebecca decides to be implanted with the 
    clone of her husband and she delivers a baby boy who looks just like 
    Thomas did when he was a baby. We then watch as Thomas grows up and 
    Rebecca definitely has incestuous thoughts about having a sexual 
    relationship with him (we watch as a naked adolescent Thomas takes a 
    bath with her equally naked mother). Shunned by the community, 
    Rebecca and Thomas move to a house on the beach, where Thomas has a 
    girlfriend who gets turned off when she sees Rebecca's lust for her 
    boyfriend. When Thomas is all grown up and looks exactly like 
    Rebecca's husband, he finds out the truth that he is a clone and has 
    sex with Rebecca. If Rebecca gets pregnant, what would that make a 
    baby (There's talk in the film about a woman giving birth to her own 
    mother!)? This is a slow-moving movie and the acting is good, but the 
    subject matter of director/writer Benedek Fliegauf's (<B><A HREF="just_the_wind_2012.htm">JUST

    substance. When dignitaries of China's first (and only) female 
    empress begin to spontaneously combust (a neat effect using very good 
    CGI and stunt work), Detective Dee (Andy Lau) is pulled out of prison 
    to solve the case before her coronation. He quickly determines that 
    the internal human fires are caused by the poison of the rare fire 
    beetle put in the drinking water and when the sun hits them, they

    priest that is one of Gooding's only friends and receives a statue of 
    the Mother Mary made of pure heroin from a drug dealer trying to

    but like it, but the truth is that it is a terribly acted cheap flick 
    with that faux &quot;grindhousey&quot; look (fake emulsion scratches, 
    missing frames, etc) that just annoys the viewer. The plot is so old 
    hat (a janitor and a bunch of drunks fight zombies/cadavers that come 
    to life at a local medical college) that even the employees at an old

    Maybe it's because the producers re-edited the film without 
    Lundgren's input or it was just weak to begin with. Lundgren stars as 
    Edward Genn, code-named Icarus, a Soviet sleeper agent in the United 
    States who turned investment banker when the Soviet Union collapsed. 
    His cover is blown in an unfortunate accident in Hong Kong and now he 
    must try to protect his divorced wife and young daughter against 
    Russian assassins sent out to kill him and his family by bad guy Bo 
    Svenson. There's plenty of gunplay and violence, but most of it is 
    unremarkable. I can forgive Lundgren for one bad film since most of

     <B><A HREF="creature_2010.htm">CREATURE</A></B> (2010) has a good 
    cast, but all it really is is a guy in a rubber monster suit killing 
    six twenty-somethings out (two brother and sisters and an interracial 
    couple) for a good time in New Orleans. They take a shortcut and end 
    up at a place named &quot;Choppers&quot;, a gas station (but they are 
    out of gas)/convenience store run by Chopper (Sid Haig; his role 
    reminds me of his turn in <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#House 1000 Corpses">HOUSE
     OF 1000 CORPSES</A></B> [2002], minus the clown makeup) and his two 
    employees, Jimmy (David Jensen), who is missing fingers due to an 
    alligator attack (there is a funny scene when Randy [Aaron Hill] asks 
    Jimmy how much it costs for a six-pack of beer and he has to hold up 
    two hands to show five fingers!) and Bud (Wayne P&eacute;re), who 
    gets his jollies making fun of the tourists. There is also a display 
    on a local legend called Lockjaw, who was once a human being named 
    Grimley Bodeen (Daniel Bernhardt; <B><A HREF="matrix_reloaded_2003.htm">THE
     MATRIX RELOADED</A></B> [2003]) who, back in the 1800's, was the 
    last of their incestuous family line along with his young sister 
    (Rebekah Kennedy). Just as they are about to get married and have a 
    baby, keeping the family line going, an albino alligator pulls the 
    sister into the Louisiana bayou and tears her apart. Grimley searches 
    the underground caverns in the swamp waters, where he finds the 
    albino alligator and rips its jaw off. Grimley is so mentally 
    disturbed about his sister's death (incest will do that to you), he 
    begins to eat the white alligator and turns into Lockjaw (also played 
    by Daniel Bernhardt), an alligator-looking monster that walks on two 
    feet. Chopper gives Oscar (Dillon Casey) a map to Grimley's house and 
    the six deserving-to-die tourists head out into the middle of the 
    bayou to look for the shack (it is not the real Grimley house because 
    it was swallowed up by a sinkhole, a problem in this area, but a 
    rebuilt shack made expressly for tourists back in 1984). While the 
    six tourists (including Oscar's sister Karen [Lauren Schneider]) are 
    searching for the shack, Lockjaw kills the town's bicycle-riding 
    crazy man, Grover (Pruitt Taylor Vince; what the hell is an actor of 
    his caliber doing in a film like this? And didn't Crazy Ralph ride a 
    bicycle in <B><A HREF="friday_the_13th_1980.htm">FRIDAY THE 13TH</A></B> 
    [1980]?), by biting off his arm and ripping him apart. The rest of 
    the film is your standard &quot;monster on the loose&quot; horror 
    film with one surprising moment in the middle of the film (it turns 
    out the area is full of incest families and one of the six tourists 
    is part of that clan, who sacrifices a female family member to 
    Lockjaw so he can impregnate her and keep the Bodeen family line in 
    existence), but it is not enough to save it from being a standard 
    monster horror flick. I have to say I was hoping it was going to be 
    good when, in the opening scene, we see a totally naked girl (nothing 
    is left to the imagination) take a dip in the bayou water and then 
    get attacked underwater by Lockjaw. She crawls out of the bayou 
    water, and as as the camera pulls back, we see that her legs are 
    missing. But, besides that scene, it is nothing but a mixture of 
    incest and a giant alligator monster killing people. It could have 
    been so much better if director/co-screenwriter (with Tracy Morse) 
    Fred M. Andrews (so far, his only film as a director, although he was 
    Production Designer on films such as <B><A HREF="dark_ride_2006.htm">DARK
     RIDE</A></B> [2006] and TV Series like <B><A HREF="csi_miami_tv.htm">CSI:
     MIAMI</A></B> [2005-2010]) took a little bit longer to flesh out the 
    story. It would have then gotten a positive review from me. If you 
    want positives about the film, it would be the nudity, the infrequent 
    gory violence and Sid Haig. Anything with Sid Haig is worth watching, 
    even the bad ones. Also starring Mehcad Brooks (actually the hero of 
    the film), Serinda Swan and Amanda Fuller as the other three members 
    of the tourist group. <B>TRIVIA:</B> This $3 million film earned only

     EYES</A></B> (2011) is one of the most somber action films I have 
    ever seen. A thief named Hong (Cung Le) accidentally shoots and kills 
    a woman while running away from the police and is sent to prison. His 
    cellmate is Tiano (Jean-Claude Van Damme, in what amounts to an 
    extended cameo of flashbacks), a criminal lifer who killed his son in 
    a burglary, who teaches a terminally depressed Hong that his life 
    still has worth and also teaches him martial arts and meditation. 
    When Hong gets out of prison, he follows Tiano's promise to clean-up 
    the town of St. Jude, which is overrun with Latino, Black and Russian 
    drug gangs, all protected by the crooked Mr. V (Peter Weller, who is 
    the best thing about this film. He makes a corkscrew look straight in 
    comparison.), St. Jude's Chief of Police. Hong is soon turning the 
    gangs against each other, while fictitiously &quot;working&quot; for 
    Mr. V. Plenty of martial arts and gunfights follow, but there is

    Depp (They've spent most of the money on huge diamonds and stuff for 
    themselves). They high-tail it out of town when Loggia demands his 
    money back and see a commercial (by a funny Will Ferrell) offering 
    anyone a billion dollars to take over and refurbish his run-down 
    shopping mall (where a store is devoted to selling used toilet paper 
    and a wild wolf runs rampant). How big a coincidence is that? The duo 
    travel to the mall and take it over, with Tim stealing a child from 
    his father and making the kid his own (yeah, pedophilia is funny) and 
    a sickly John C. Reilly (who is the best thing about this film) 
    sacrificing himself to the wolf by attaching pizza slices all over 
    his body, while Loggia and his band of executives try to find them. 
    The whole movie is summed-up in the final 15 minutes, where Eric's 
    true love is shot in the head by Loggia (yet no windows break, even 
    though Loggia is on the outside and Eric is inside the mall) as he is 
    proposing marriage and Tim uses his new son as a decoy (he throws him 
    in the air and Loggia and his men shoot the kid until he bloodily 
    explodes). The duo then take a bunch of swords and knives and throw 
    them at Loggia and his gang, decapitating all of them. This movie is 
    about as funny as a kid with no legs falling down a well. Some will 
    dig it, but others like me will find it disgustingly off-target; <B><A HREF="recoil_2011.htm">RECOIL</A></B> 
    (2011) is your standard Steve Austin DTV action vehicle, which could 
    be interchangeable with any recent DTV action flick. Austin is a cop 
    who witnesses his entire family being gunned down by Danny Trejo and 
    his motorcycle gang during a birthday party. He turns vigilante and 
    begins killing members of Trejo's gang, then traveling to the town of 
    Hope (how ironic!), where Trejo and his gang own the alcoholic 
    Sheriff and the entire town. With the help of inn owner Serinda Swan, 
    Austin begins dismantling the gang and their meth distribution 
    business by killing them one-by-one, while FBI agent Lochlyn Munro 
    tries to stop him. It all comes down to the prerequisite final fight 
    between Austin and Trejo. Uninspired in every department. Austin and 
    Trejo have done much better; <B><A HREF="tactical_force_2011.htm">TACTICAL
     FORCE</A></B> (2011) is still another standard Steve Austin DTV 
    action flick. Austin is the head of a Los Angeles S.W.A.T. squad who

    nothing but blanks in their guns. Can't you just see what is coming 
    next? That's right, Austin and his men find themselves in the middle 
    of a turf war between two rival gangs, who decide to join forces to 
    kill Austin and his team. How do you fight them when all you have is 
    blanks? With Austin, that's no trouble. He'll just use his brute 
    force to steal weapons from the gangs. Everything is telegraphed from 
    the beginning. Nothing new or exciting here, except there is more

    (who look like fist-sized spiders). The experiment was a complete

    (2011) is a routine horror anthology with a twist: The trio of 
    stories are how Mexicans get their revenge on White America. Even the 
    wraparound tale is about two white guys who head south of the border 
    to buy some drugs from a scar-faced Mexican who tells them three 
    tales around a campfire. The first tale is about a Mexican witch who 
    gets revenge on rich white privileged young adults who accidentally 
    kill her maid daughter. The second tale is about a taco stand cook 
    who is actually a cannibal, making his tacos from the flesh of his 
    white customers. The third tale is about a family of white coyotes 
    (people who smuggle Mexicans across the border) who get their 
    comeuppance when they decide to torture and kill their customers 
    instead of letting them loose in America. Nearly every white person 
    in this film is portrayed as the scum of the Earth, while the 
    Mexicans are portrayed as people who are only defending themselves or 
    their heritage. This film will not further the progress of 
    immigration reform; I really wanted to like director Douglas 
    Aarniokoski's <B><A HREF="day_2011.htm">THE DAY</A></B> (2011), 
    especially since I enjoyed his <B><A HREF="nurse_3d_2012.htm">NURSE 3D</A></B> 
    (2012) so much, but the fact is that it makes so little sense and is 
    filmed in that washed-out color technique and an aggravating 
    performance by Shannyn Sossamon (<B><A HREF="catacombs_2007.htm">CATACOMBS</A></B> 
    - 2007), that I wanted to wring her neck and fiddle with the controls 
    of my TV. The film opens up with five people (Shawn Ashmore, Dominic 
    Monaghan, Cory Hardrict, Ashley Bell and Shannyn Sossamon) walking 
    down a desolate road and taking refuge in a deserted farmhouse. It's 
    all a trap, of course, because nearly the entire population of the 
    world have turned into cannibals. They look just like us, talk just 
    like us and move like us (probably to save on a special effects 
    makeup budget) and the only way to tell the difference is by their 
    eating habits and a tattoo on a part of their bodies. When Monaghan (<B><A HREF="lost_tv_series_2004-2010.htm">LOST</A></B>

     LAST EXORCISM 1 &amp; 2</A></B> - 2010 &amp; 2013) is one of the 
    cannibals (but hates her kind), this is where the film becomes 
    extremely irritating when Sossamon wants to kill Bell, but Ashmore (<B><A HREF="following_tv_series_2013.htm">THE

     GATE</A></B> - 2016) stops her after removing the piece of skin on 
    Bell's thigh that has the tattoo on it. Even though Bell saves 
    Sossamon's skin two times when the cannibals storm the farmhouse, she 
    still wants Bell dead and takes all the bullets out of her gun when 
    Bell stays behind to fight the cannibals, while Ashmore and Sossamon 
    leave through a back window and escape. When Ashmore realizes what 
    Sossamon has done, he goes back to fight with Bell and ends up losing 
    his life (Hardict [<B><A HREF="driftwood_2006.htm">DRIFTWOOD</A></B> 
    - 2006] has already lost his life and has become cannibal food, which 
    we never see), as does Sossamon, who gets her throat cut by the head 
    cannibal's little girl (Sossamon shot and killed her twin brother 
    during that night). This leaves Bell the surviving winner and when 
    she walks away, the little girl follows her, but Bell kills her and 
    uses her headband to tie-off the wound on her thigh. THE END. This is 
    another Hard-R Rated film from the WWE, who finally started to make 
    gory films again after making a string of PG-13 snorefests while 
    Linda McMahon was running for Governor of Connecticut (but lost). 
    While there are many gory moments, the washed-out photography (only 
    one flashback was in full color) and mostly night filming takes away 
    from most of the effects. This played in 16 theaters for one week 
    (where it only made $20,000 total), while playing simultaneously on 
    VOD, before being dumped on home video and cable TV. This has 
    &quot;average&quot; written all over it.; <B><A HREF="atm_2011.htm">ATM</A></B> 
    (2011) is one of those 3-character horror films that really says 
    nothing important and makes you mad as hell at the ending. Three 
    employees, David (Brian Geraghty; the guest star of one of my 
    favorite episodes of <B><A HREF="law_and_order_special_victims_unit_tv_series.htm">LAW
     &amp; ORDER: SVU</A></B> titled &quot;Quickie&quot; [2010] with the 
    late Jack Larson as his grandfather), Emily (Alice Eve) and Corey 
    (Josh Peck), leave the office Christmas party so David and Emily can 
    go on their first date, but they are cockblocked by Corey, who needs 
    a ride home. Corey wants to stop for a pizza, but doesn't have enough 
    money, so David drives him to the nearest secluded ATM (constructed 
    solely for this film) and parks far away, because it is very cold out 
    and David is punishing Corey (who is not wearing a winter coat) for 
    wanting a pizza (The film's biggest hole. Don't they know pizza 
    places accept credit and debit cards?). Pretty soon, because of 
    various circumstances, all three of them are in the glass-enclosed 
    ATM vestibule and there is a man outside dressed in a fur-hooded 
    parka who is just standing there looking at them. After watching this 
    stranger kill a security guard and an innocent pedestrian, they have 
    to figure out a way to get out of there. That's basically the entire 
    film: The three people try everything to escape and almost drown (in 
    one of the film's silliest moments) until only David is left alive 
    and the video cameras in the vestibule are taken out of context and 
    David is charged with murder. The killer goes back to his storage 
    locker home and figures out who his next victims will be. THE END. 
    Director David Brooks (his first feature film) and screenwriter Chris 
    Sparling (Director &amp; Screenwriter of <B><A HREF="atticus_institute_2014.htm">THE
     ATTICUS INSTITUTE</A></B> - 2014) don't leave any modern-day horror 
    tropes out of this film. Between the three of them, only Emily has a 
    cell phone and it is in her pocketbook in the car (What woman would 
    leave her pocketbook in a car and what man, even in 2011, didn't have 
    a cell phone?). Corey ends up stabbed in the stomach by the stranger 
    when he tries to receive it, but David and Emily manage to pull him 
    back into the ATM vestibule when the car has apparently been tampered 
    with. Just see how many stupid things these three people do before 
    they come up with a solution. A solution that comes too late. It has 
    to do with a Bic lighter that doesn't want to light (Horror Trope 
    #67). Available in both R-Rated and Unrated versions on the same DVD. 
    The Unrated version adds a few seconds of blood, that's all. Films 
    like this are not worth your time.;<A NAME="OurLastWeekend2011"></A> 
    What positive thing can I say about <B><A HREF="our_last_weekend_2011.htm">OUR
     LAST WEEKEND</A></B> (2011)? Not much, since this Spanish Film (in 
    Spanish with English subtitles) contains a cast of women whose 
    characters are so petty and selfish, it very hard to believe they are 
    friends, but they deserve each other. The film is about Diana (Irene 
    Rubio), who believes she is about to get a big job promotion, so she 
    invites her slutty friend, Lisi (Alba Messa) and female intern at 
    work, Leo (Silma L&oacute;pez), to spend time with with her on a 
    &quot;girls only&quot; weekend at her dead grandmother's house by the 
    sea. Right from the start we can see that these &quot;women&quot; 
    (and I use that word sarcastically) are nothing but trouble, as Lisi 
    invites male co-worker Roque (Nacho Rubio) to join her on this girls 
    only weekend because she wants to get in his pants, not knowing that 
    he is gay (Diana knows, which is why she doesn't complain, thinking 
    it will be funny to watch her hit on a gay man and fail terribly! 
    Some fucking friend.). Not helping matters is that both Diana and 
    Lisi treat Leo like their personal slave, thinking that if<A HREF="our_last_weekend_2011.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/our last weekend spain poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    she is the office intern, she should be treated that way when she is 
    not working, making her cook their meals and wash dishes before she 
    goes to bed (Diana tells her she doesn't like to wake up to dirty 
    dishes! Fuck her!). What little time Leo has to herself, she goes out 
    alone for a smoke in the woods, only to be trailed by a bearded man, 
    who seems to be in two or more places at the same time. The girls and 
    Roque go to the beach and meet surfer Tommy (Jorge Aneg&oacute;n). 
    After telling him that Leo is a lesbian (she isn't), Diana takes him 
    for a walk and fucks his brains out (There's some sort of backstory 
    that explains Diana's limp. It seems she was in a terrible car 
    accident when her drunk boyfriend got behind the wheel a few months 
    ago and something bad happened that is never explained. Either way, 
    her limp comes and goes throughout the film!), Tommy telling her not 
    to go too deep in the woods because there is a secret government 
    laboratory there and strange things have been happening in the area 
    lately. When they are driving back to the house, Diana hits the 
    bearded man with her car and kills him. Roque wants to call the 
    police, but the girls overrule him and put the body in the trunk. 
    When they get back to the house, they discover that Diana's older 
    sister Sandra (Mari&aacute;n Aguilera) has paid them a visit. After 
    telling Sandra about the body in the trunk, Sandra decides to dispose 
    of the body without calling the police. Not trusting anyone in the 
    least, she takes away everyone's cell phones so they can't call the 
    police, but somehow the dead bearded guy gets out of the trunk and 
    begins to lumber into town. Long story short, Sandra locks Roque in 
    the basement and kills the bearded man by slashing his throat with a 
    razor, only to discover that the bearded man has many doubles and 
    they kill everyone in the cast with the exception of Diana (Actually 
    Roque and Sandra kill each other. Roque stabs Sandra in the stomach 
    with a screwdriver and Sandra slashes Roque's neck with a razor.). 
    The film ends with Diana in bed! That's basically the whole film, 
    besides a UFO showing up in the finale (a terrible CGI effect), 
    nothing is ever explained. Not why the man has so many doppelgangers, 
    not the experiments the secret government lab (which we never see) is 
    performing, nothing! It ends with Diana looking forlongingly while 
    she lies on her bed! Besides these girls being bitches with a capital 
    &quot;C&quot;, nothing much happens during the film's entire running 
    time. There is copious nudity and some graphic violence, but nothing 
    worth mentioning, just a cast of despicable characters treating each 
    other like shit. Director/screenwriter Norberto Ramos del Val 
    (nothing else worth mentioning) seems to have painted himself in a 
    corner and ended the film in such an inexplicable way, it will lead 
    to groans, so, of course, this film won many awards at festivals you 
    never heard of before. The only thing decent about this film is the 
    music soundtrack by Nicklas Barker. Hey, I did find a positive thing 
    to say about it! Don't waste your time with this one, folks. You'll 
    thank me for it.</FONT></FONT></P>

    who also happens to be the town's murderous funeral home director. 
    Quaid has killed his unfaithful wife and when four teens see 
    something in the upper window of Quaid's funeral home, they break in 
    to investigate, only for Quaid to kill one of them. When the teens 
    report their friend's murder to the police, they don't believe them, 
    because the friend's body cannot be found and Quaid is highly 
    thought-of in this town. The teens decide to investigate on their 
    own, which leads to many close calls and many predictable situations. 
    There's nothing surprising here except for Quaid's short journey into 
    madness in the film's closing frames. &quot;Love sucks&quot; indeed!; <B><A HREF="silent_house_2011.htm">SILENT
     HOUSE</A></B> (2011) proves even Hollywood couldn't wait more than a 
    year to remake this &quot;one continuous take&quot; (supposedly shot 
    over four days, so how could it have been shot in one continuous 
    take?) SOV 2010 original titled <B><A HREF="silent_house_2010.htm">THE
     SILENT HOUSE</A></B> from Uruguay (I guess the filmmakers of the 
    remake decided to drop the &quot;The&quot; from the original film 
    title in hopes of making the film sound scarier. They failed.). Maybe 
    that's because it's one of those &quot;found footage&quot; films that 
    takes very little money to shoot (and is dark 50% of the time, mainly 
    so edits can be made and yet keep up the &quot;one continuous 
    take&quot; ballyhoo). Even new &quot;It&quot; star Elizabeth Olsen 
    (the sister of the notorious Olsen sisters; filmed before she became 
    &quot;famous&quot; in films like the highly disturbing <B><A HREF="martha_marcy_may_marlene_2012.htm">MARTHA
     MARCY MAY MARLENE</A></B> [2011]) can't save a film this cheap. I'm 
    not a fan of the original, either, or 99% of the films that use this 
    technique. To me, &quot;movies&quot; filmed this way hope to recoup 
    their meager budget back in the first week and then let the film 
    drift off into obscurity on DVD and cable TV. This remake is one of 
    those films. Some of these films get lucky and make a lot of money, 
    which is why Hollywood keeps churning them out; I had high hopes for <B><A HREF="collapsed_2011.htm">THE
     COLLAPSED</A></B> (2011) since I read so many good things about it, 
    but when I finally viewed it, nothing but deja vu came to mind. It's 
    the old &quot;end of the world&quot; scenario, where some sort of 
    disease is killing most of the planet's population and those that 
    don't die are either immune or turn into cannibals. A family of four 
    decide they are better off traveling in the forest than on city 
    streets to avoid those that are infected. As they are traversing the 
    woods, the father has a &quot;feeling&quot; that &quot;something&quot;
     is following them and it turns out to be true when the father and 
    son return from a food-finding mission to discover the mother and 
    daughter dead. Pretty soon the son turns up dead, too, and the father 
    looks to get retribution for the person or persons involved in his 
    family's deaths. The problem is that the &quot;surprise&quot; finale 
    is telegraphed as soon as the father discovers his wife and daughter 
    dead and director/screenwriter Justin McConnell (the 2013 documentary <B><A HREF="skull_world_2013.htm">SKULL
     WORLD</A></B>) does little to make us believe otherwise. There are a 
    few bloody deaths, but the film is mostly talk, talk, talk and none 
    of it is involving at all. This only proves one thing: When a film 
    receives awards at festivals you never heard of and rave reviews from 
    people you never heard of, they are probably shilling for the 
    director or have some other interest in the film, like contributing 
    to a crowd-funding campaign. There is nothing in this Ontario, 
    Canada-lensed flick that is the least bit original. It's OK if you 
    have nothing better to watch, but that is hardly a recommendation; <B><A HREF="urban_explorer_2011.htm">URBAN
     EXPLORER</A></B> (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="depraved_2011.htm">THE DEPRAVED</A></B> 
    - 2011) is your standard bloody semi-torture porn about a group of 
    four older multinational twenty-somethings and their German guide who 
    decide to explore the Berlin underground subway system and run 
    smack-dab into a bricked-up Nazi bunker with strange paintings inside 
    and occupied by a psychotic Nazi-obsessed German (He looks like a 
    big-toothed Lee Marvin; at least half of the movie is in 
    English-subtitled German) who begins using the kids as his bloody 
    playthings, doing all sorts of gory things to them. This film, 
    directed by German Andy Fetscher (his first theatrical film) takes 
    forever to get the film moving (even suggesting that aliens were the 
    ones that convinced the Germans that they were the Master Race!) and 
    once it does, the kids make one stupid move after another (like 
    splitting up in a place you have never been before is a good thing, 
    especially when your German guide has just fell thirty feet and 
    broken his thigh bone due to the stupid antics of the only male urban 
    explorer, who decides to take a flash picture of the guide as he is 
    crossing a dangerous precipice!). They derserve their bloody fates. 
    Not involving and not worth your time, no matter what those reviewers 
    say on IMDb, many of who probably worked on the film or knew someone 
    that did; <B><A HREF="grave_encounters_2011.htm">GRAVE ENCOUNTERS</A></B> 
    (2011) is one of those awful &quot;found footage&quot; films where 
    the camera shakes like an earthquake whenever something interesting 
    happens. In the film's only non-found footage sequence, the movie 
    opens with a man telling the audience that what we are about to see 
    is unedited and raw footage of Episode 5 of a ghost hunting show 
    called Grave Encounters, where everyone involved in the show are 
    investigating a long-closed psychiatric facility (where 80 patients 
    supposedly died) and mysteriously disappeared. We then go to the 
    video footage, where a group of people (including a lone female) 
    bicker, argue and yell at each other until things start to happen, 
    like doors opening by themselves, the crew being pushed around by 
    unseen forces and so on (including that by-now old standby: no cell 
    service). Only during the final 15 minutes do we barely see a couple 
    of ghosts whose mouths open large enough to put both your fists in 
    (but then suddenly, cameras become pixelated or snowy), the lone 
    woman has something carved onto her back and everyone gets picked off 
    one-by-one, but their video cameras conveniently fall the other way 
    so all we hear are their screams. The movie ends with the lone 
    survivor sitting in the hospital's underground tunnels waiting to 
    die. Written and Directed by &quot;The Vicious Brothers&quot; (<B><A HREF="extraterrestrial_2014.htm">EXTRATERRESTRIAL</A></B> 
    - 2014), who are actually Colin Minihan &amp; Stuart Ortiz, the film 
    is nothing but a shaky-cam tease that tries to see how many times the 
    actors can say &quot;fuck&quot; in a sentence. Avoid it. This was one 
    of those films that was simultaneously shown in limited theaters and 
    VOD, as was its familiar sequel, <B><A HREF="grave encounters_2_2012.htm">GRAVE
     ENCOUNTERS 2</A></B> (2012), which sends another investigative team 
    into the same hospital to find out what happened to the first crew, 
    with the same results. That one was only written by The Vicious 
    Brothers and directed by John Poliquin. As with the first film, it 
    induces headaches rather than fear.; Everyone who reads this website 
    knows that I love Australian horror films, but even the Australians 
    would think that <B><A HREF="wrath_2011.htm">WRATH</A></B> (2011) is 
    a minor mashup of several successful films of theirs, including <B><A HREF="wolf_creek_2004.htm">WOLF
     CREEK</A></B> (2004). The story is your basic group of friends 
    taking a trip through the South Outback (filmed in beautiful New 
    South Wales, Australia) when they run across a murderous group called 
    the Thompson Family. The rest of the film is generic cat and mouse 
    games, where members of the Thompson clan kill the group one by one 
    (usually with a long rifle or shotgun), until daughter Leah Thompson 
    (Stef Dawson) thinks they are going too far. She kills her father 
    after her father kills his son (by ramming his head over and over 
    with the butt of his shotgun) for daring to point a rifle at him and 
    the last surviving member of the traveling group, Caroline (Rebecca 
    Ratcliff), takes Leah's daughter, escapes and then Leah kills 
    herself, putting the Thompson curse at an end. There's not very much 
    to this film and you will be watching the clock more than the screen, 
    thanks to director/screenwriter/producer Jonathan Dixon's pedestrian 
    direction and generic screenplay. Hey not every Australian horror 
    film can't be a winner, as this movie proves.; <A HREF="amityville_haunting_2011.htm"><B>THE
     AMITYVILLE HAUNTING</B></A> (2011) is a &quot;found footage&quot; 
    film purportedly showing us footage that the police discovered from 
    phones they found in the house, but since it is from The Asylum, I 
    guess you know what that means. That's right, it's awful. For one 
    thing, the house this film was &quot;shot&quot; in (and I use that 
    term sparingly) looks nothing like the Amityville house and the 
    characters are so annoying, you'll want the demons of the house to 
    kill them immediately. This is the type of film that when anything 
    interesting is about to happen, the video on the phone glitches out 
    and we return to the footage after the bad stuff happens. It's cheap, 
    boring and crappy (in that order). I has a better time counting the

    DEVIL INSIDE</A></B> (2011) is one of those infuriating &quot;found 
    footage&quot; supernatural horror flicks that just ends without 
    resolving anything and then has the nerve to point you to a web site 
    for further information! I wonder how audiences in theaters took that 
    bit of cop-outishness? I'm sure they demanded their money back! The 
    story, as it were, is about a daughter who hasn't seen her mother for 
    over 20 years, after her mother murdered two priests and a nun who 
    were performing an exorcism on her in 1989. Her mother was found not 
    guilty due to insanity in a court of law, but the Vatican had her 
    moved to a religious asylum in Italy, not allowing her daughter to 
    see her. She assembles a &quot;documentary crew&quot; (which is just 
    her and a cameraman!) with the purpose of interviewing her mother and 
    taking classes on exorcisms! Two priests, working without the 
    Vatican's approval, tell the daughter that in order to understand an 
    exorcism, she has to attend a real one, which she does. As you can 
    probably guess, the daughter also becomes possessed (her mother is 
    possessed by multiple demons) when one of the demons leaves her 
    mother's body and possesses the daughter in an unofficial exorcism 
    performed by the two priests. The film ends with a car crash 
    involving the daughter, one of the priests (the other one committed 
    suicide!) and her possessed cameraman (!) and none of the plot points 
    are cleared up, with the aforementioned web site address popping-up 
    on screen telling the viewer to go there if they want to get updates 
    on the case! Well, I went to the web site, but it wanted to add 
    extensions to my browser and change my search criteria. Fuck that and

    house&quot; horror flick, where something lives in the mirrors and 
    they have another relative that is the &quot;family secret&quot;. The 
    biggest mystery of this film is how it can have a 2011 production 
    date when co-star Paul Gleason (who has a sizable role as an 
    interviewing detective) passed away in 2006? I smell a troubled production!;<A NAME="Venom2011"></A>&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;

    a horror film (this one is a.k.a. <B><A HREF="venom_2011.htm#SnakedFear">SNAKED
     FEAR</A></B>) and this one is probably the worst of the lot simply 
    because of the stupid plot and dialogue. A drugged-out rock singer 
    named Helen (Jessica Morris; we see her in the opening five minutes 
    partying at a bar, doing coke in the ladies room and almost passing 
    out on a curb of some Hollywood street) snatches her daughter Lilly 
    (Oliviah Crawford) away from her unseen separated husband (he has 
    custody) and driving her through the Mojave Desert, where she wants 
    to spend some alone time with her at a ranch she stayed at when she 
    was younger. Long story short, her vehicle is not in the best 
    condition (perfect for driving through a very hot desert!) and when 
    they hit and kill a female snake in heat, it's male partner and a few 
    dozen other snakes try to kill the pair (because Helen somehow got 
    the female's scent on her body when removing it from her car's 
    tire!). Helen is bitten by the male snake (luckily, he only got one 
    fang in her!) and must traverse the hot desert with Lilly when their 
    car won't start (She even throws her cell phone away when her husband 
    calls and wants to know where they are!). At the same time, a 
    helicopter belonging to a drug dealer named Viggo (Roberto 'Sanz' 
    Sanchez) crashes in the same area of the desert and a greedy cohort, 
    Rojas (Israel S&aacute;ez de Miguel) steals all Viggo's money on the 
    copter (after killing another cohort) and traverses the desert while 
    Viggo and still another cohort go looking for him. Helen and Lilly 
    run into Rojas (he tries to rape Helen, but fails!), who is then 
    bitten by a snake and dies (Lilly puts a snake in his canteen and 
    when he goes to take a drink, the snake bites him inside his mouth!). 
    They bury the money, but Lilly takes a bundle behind Mom's back and 
    pockets it. As you can probably guess, Viggo meets Helen and Lilly in 
    the desert and wants his money back. That basically the entire plot 
    of the film, which is full of so many stupid situations (including an 
    old man [Chuck Kelley], who knows the desert like the back of his 
    hand, getting bitten by the male snake and dying after all three of 
    them sleep for the night on he ground! I guess he didn't know the 
    desert as well as he thought!) and dialogue that sounds like it was 
    written by a ten-year-old, you'll be throwing your hands in the air 
    out of sheer desperation at the stupidity of Helen (Who the fuck 
    throws their cellphone away in the desert? Who dares drive a beat-up 
    car in the desert? Why didn't she try to find the phone before 
    trekking through the desert, stopping every so often to throw up 
    because she was bitten by a poisonous snake?). <A HREF="alien_exorcism_2009.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/alien exorcism amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>While
     not poorly acted (Helen and Lilly do have chemistry together), the 
    screenplay (by Joan Canning Boris; it's not surprising this is her 
    only film credit) does them no favors and the first five minutes, 
    where Helen boozes and cokes it up, seems like it belongs in a 
    different film. Turgidly directed by Gary Breslin (his only feature 
    film at the time of this review). The snakes in this film (and I know 
    my snakes, growing up next to a swamp in my childhood years) are 
    non-poisonous and harmless King and Corn snakes, species that don't 
    live in the desert! Avoid this film if only for your own sanity.;<A NAME="AlienExorcism2011"></A>&nbsp;

    sounds as bad as it really is, but, damn if I couldn't take my eyes 
    off it. The premise is simple and complicated at the same time. It 
    seems aliens have been on the Earth as long as man, possessing our 
    bodies, but kept hidden, using our souls as a way to energize 
    themselves (The aliens can't survive on our planet in their natural 
    form). Unfortunately, the aliens use our souls too much, causing 
    people to die prematurely. A psychiatrist, Dr. Davide Piso (Massimo 
    Poggio), is aware of the alien presence, as he has been hypnotizing 
    people and talking directly to the aliens, trying to get them to 
    leave their host bodies. A young woman named Saturnia (Laura Glavan) 
    contacts Davide and he discovers she is possessed by an alien named 
    &quot;Hexabor of Ur&quot;, who has found a way to use the human soul 
    permanently, not causing the host body's death prematurely. If the 
    alien manages to contact his superiors, it would mean the aliens will 
    posssess everyone and take over the Earth. Davide and his team keep 
    Hexabor at bay by drugging Saturnia with heroin (!), in hopes of 
    finding a way to get Hexabor out of Saturnia's body. A top-secret 
    government agency, The Kabballah Project, is also after Saturnia 
    (also, her parents are ultra-rich and think she has been kidnapped), 
    so they are helped by government agent Giovanni Cervo (Nazzareno 
    Bomba) and priest Father Trismegisto (portrayed by director Varo 
    Venturi) to try to defeat Hexabor and save the human race. Yes, there 
    is actually an alien exorcism performed by a Greek priest, but 
    Hexabor calls him out as being a pedophile, which he freely admits 
    to! Filled with one weird scene after the next (such as bar codes 
    revealing that the alien's frequency is -666!; How do we defeat the 
    aliens? Why, we host a rave!), this Italian horror/sci-fi film makes 
    absolutely no sense and is as bad as they come, but there's something 
    about it that kept me watching, so much so that I almost put this in 
    the &quot;good&quot; section. Thankfully, saner heads prevailed. If 
    you want to watch it, it is available streaming on Amazon Prime. It's 
    not surprising that director Varo Venturi hasn't made another feature 
    film after this (at least at the time of this review, which took 
    place during January 2020). Made in 2009, but not released until 2011.;<A NAME="HauntFoxHollow2011"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Say, have you about an hour to spare to watch a &quot;paranormal 
    investigation&quot; film, but after watching it, it seemed like eight 
    hours passed you by? Such is the case with <B><A HREF="haunting_of_fox_hollow_farm_2011.htm">THE
     HAUNTING OF FOX HOLLOW FARM</A></B> (2011), one of the most tepid 
    semi-found footage films starring &quot;real life&quot; paranormal 
    investigators, psychics and private detectives. To say this film 
    &quot;reaches&quot; for the truth is quite evident, but first a 
    little history about the place. A serial killer name Herb Baumeister 
    lived in the Indianapolis, Indiana residence with his wife and kids, 
    but they didn't know that their husband and father would bring gay 
    men to his house&nbsp; and kill them, usually in the indoor pool in 
    the house's basement. He buried most of his victims in his 11-acre 
    backyard and when police discovered over 5,000 bone fragments in his 
    backyard, he drove to Canada and committed suicide (some say he was 
    murdered). It was believed he killed 20 or more people, but only 11 
    bodies were identified. He hacked his victims to pieces and cut off 
    their heads and they were never found. He was also believed to be 
    &quot;The I-70 Killer&quot; (Google it), but that was never proven. 
    The house is said to be haunted by Baumeister and his victims and 
    several paranormal teams arrive at the house and try to contact them. 
    The first half of the &quot;movie&quot; is a straight-up detective 
    investigation of the case and the final half is the paranormal 
    investigation, where psychics say such common things as &quot;I see 
    he died next to water&quot; or &quot;I see a man named Rob, Robert or 
    Roger, I know his first name begins with an &quot;R&quot;. Shit like 
    that. The final half is also primarily shot in nightvision, that 
    sickly green footage where everyones' eyes shine in the dark, making 
    them look demonic. The film's primary sin is reading too many things 
    into EVP messages that were recorded, hearing what they want to hear 
    and ignoring that it could be something totally different or just 
    nonsense sounds. (EVP is the most overused technology in paranormal 
    investigations. It all comes down to whether you believe the dead are 
    talking to you. Personally, I don't believe it. I think it is just 
    some random sounds read as dialogue by desperate people.)The film's 
    other major sin is slowing down voices so they sound demonic. So, 
    does this film reveal anything paranormal? No, it doesn't, but it 
    wants you to belive it has. It is all processed through available 
    computer technology to make everything seem paranormal, using EVP, 
    nightvision and static footage to make you feel like you are seeing 
    something paranormal, when in actuality you aren't. Films like this 
    are <A HREF="paranormal_investigation_films_on_amazon_prime.htm">a

    until the final ten minutes. Stay tuned after the final credits for a 
    longer-than-usual stinger, but it doesn't make this film any much 
    less a stinker; <B><A HREF="chernobyl_diaries_2012.htm">CHERNOBYL DIARIES</A></B> 
    (2012) was a theatrical release that bombed, not because it was 
    advertised as a &quot;found footage&quot; film (that's only partially 
    true), but because it is nothing but a giant cheat on the audience. A 
    bunch of American tourists decide to take a not-so-legal tour of 
    Chernobyl and become stranded. They are attacked one-by-one by 
    something, but every time the attacks happen, the 
    &quot;shakey-cam&quot; effect comes into use, even when no video 
    cameras or phones are used. We never get a good look at the attackers 
    (who are supposedly mutants who refused to leave the area and survive 
    by eating tourists), so what's the point of watching this film? The 
    final two-thirds of the film takes place in total darkness, except 
    for the single flashlight one of the tourist carries, so be prepared 
    to squint a lot. It also has one of those endings where everyone is 
    killed; the final one being locked in a cell by the Russian military 
    with a bunch of hungry mutants; Speaking of found footage, <B><A HREF="shadow_people_2012.htm">SHADOW
     PEOPLE</A></B> (2012) could be considered a &quot;semi-found 
    footage&quot; film in the same vein of <B><A HREF="fourth_kind_2009.htm">THE

    the phenomena, being a victim of it when I was a kid.). Dallas 
    Roberts plays supposedly real-life Kentucky ex-radio talk DJ Charlie 
    Crowe (who passed away in 2010 [apparently]), who receives a phone 
    call from a listener who tries to kill himself with a gun over the 
    airwaves to keep the &quot;Shadow People&quot; away from him (they 
    are capable of stealing your breath and only appear when the lights 
    are out). His shot misses and he ends up in the hospital, but dies in 
    his sleep from a little-known condition called &quot;Sudden 
    Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome&quot; (or SUNDS). The CDC is 
    called in and representative Sophie Lacombe (Alison Eastwood) works 
    with Charlie (who becomes a local celebrity) to find out if Shadow 
    People actually exist. They discover a professor who ran secret 
    experiments on Shadow People in the early 70's and every one of his 
    patients died, but he buried all his filmed footage of the 
    experiments in his coffin (while he was cremated). After digging up 
    the evidence, Charlie and Sophie discover an image of one of the 
    Shadow People, but Sophie talks Charlie from admitting they are real 
    (figuring the &quot;placebo effect&quot; would cause worldwide 
    deaths) and he falsely admits on TV that it was all a prank played by 
    him on the radio. Charlie loses his job at the radio station and ends 
    up being the butt of everyone's joke in Kentucky, those people not 
    knowing he probably saved a lot of their lives. The biggest problem 
    with this film is that it lacks any suspense and the supposedly 
    &quot;real&quot; footage could easily have been faked. The PG-13 
    rating keeps most violence down to a minimum and we really never get 
    a good look at the Shadow People (which is probably the whole point 
    of them being shadows!). Even though I was a believer when I was a 
    kid and saw many Shadow People near my bed several times (they also 
    played with my sense of depth perception, even though I was only born 
    with one good eye), the phenomenon soon passed and I have never seen 
    them again. A figment of my childish imagination? Possibly. But this 
    film will not convince you one way or the other. Stay until after the 
    final credits for a stern warning. Most people from Kentucky never 
    knew this happened, which tells me the entire film is nothing but a 
    work of fiction. But the Shadow People certainly weren't when I was a 
    kid in New Jersey. The best film to show the Shadow People is still <B><A HREF="ghost_1990.htm">GHOST</A></B>

    (2012) is a slow-burn horror film written and directed by Richard 
    Bates Jr. (based on his 2008 short film of the same name) about plain 
    jane schoolgirl Pauline (AnnaLynne McCord; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#DayOfTheDead2007">DAY

    taking the ugliness factor a little too far for believability) who 
    gets harassed by the clique of pretty girls (she tells one girl, 
    &quot;Your vagina looks like a diseased axe wound.&quot;), but all 
    she can think of is cutting open the human body and feeling the 
    insides (first she operates on a dead bird she finds on the 
    sidewalk). She invites a guy from her school back to her house for 
    sex (where she imagines they are making love in a huge puddle of 
    blood with his insides showing) and makes him perform oral sex on her 
    without telling him she is having her period (she is also a virgin; 
    it is still the film's most disgusting scene). Her parents, played by 
    Traci Lords (the best thing about this film; her acting is nothing 
    short of amazing, telling Pauline, who tests her ultra-religious 
    mom's patience by telling her that she will get married to a black

    over-powering wife, become more concerned with her, and rightfully 
    so, because as the finale shows, Pauline (who has shaved her head) 
    has been operating on her beloved younger sickly sister Grace (Ariel 
    Winter) in the garage (who has Cystic Fibrosis and needs a lung 
    transplant) and has opened her up, replacing her diseased lungs with 
    good ones from the dismembered body of the young girl who lives 
    across the street, telling her mother she couldn't fix Grace by 
    transplanting the new lungs into her, but will do better next time. 
    All Mom can do is hug the bloody Pauline and scream, as the screen 
    fades to black. What the fuck? Filmed with fantasies of bloodletting 
    and dismemberment (including Pauline holding her own severed head), 
    the film really adds up to nothing (although there are plenty of 
    other people who disagree), even with cameos by Matthew Gray Gubler (<B><A HREF="criminal_minds_tv_series.htm">CRIMINAL

    a cast like that, you would expect a lot more than this.; <B><A HREF="demented_2012.htm">THE

    biological weapon accidentally (?) gets released in a small town and 
    six visiting young adults must avoid the infected, who act like fast 
    moving zombies. This film contains all the standard zombie 
    stereotypes: Hiding from the infected while trying not to be eaten or 
    bitten and be infected; death by beheading or repeated smacks in the 
    head with a baseball bat; trying to find a way out of town where a 
    road doesn't have one of the cheapest roadblocks ever put on film (Flimsy-looking
     wooden barriers with no military personnel manning them); and an 
    attempted escape by auto in which an infected little girl make them 
    flip the car. In other words director/screenwriter Christopher 
    Roosevelt (his freshman effort) must have watched every modern-day 
    zombie film before writing this story. The only thing different (and 
    maddening) is the finale, where we see the main female, Taylor (Kayla 
    Ewell), and main guy Brice (Ashlee Brian), escape all this by getting 
    picked up by a helicopter, only to discover it was a dream by Taylor, 
    as we see the infected chow down on the Taylor and Brice. Why do 
    modern filmmakers think that every horror film has to have a downbeat

    In 1927, on the man-made (and real) Blarney Island in the middle of 
    Grace Lake, Illinois (The &quot;island&quot; is nothing but a series 
    of wooden docks attached to each other, where buildings are erected. 
    It was used in the 1920's as an illegal&nbsp; getaway during 
    Prohibition, where speakeasies were built and gangsters hung out. 
    Since they were in the middle of a lake, it was easy to see anyone 
    approaching the &quot;island&quot; from all sides, making it a 
    perfect illegal hangout for bootleggers and black<A HREF="paranormal_island_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/paranormal island dvd front6a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    marketeers), the owner of the island, Sammy, a.k.a. &quot;The 
    Caretaker&quot;, is playing poker against a rival bar owner. When 
    Sammy runs out of money, he bets the deed to the island on the next 
    hand. Sammy loses the deed to the island when he has a flush and his 
    rival has a straight (Hey, wait a minute, that's not right!), so 
    Sammy shoots himself in the head and haunts the island from that 
    point on. We are then in the present, where three college students, 
    Mike (Randy Wayne), Lori (Sarah Karges) and Jerry (Ben Elliott), have 
    taken jobs as bartenders on Blarney Island (it has turned into a 
    party island full of young people getting drunk and acting stupid) to 
    earn some extra money. Mike has another reason for going to the 
    island. He wants to videotape it to prove there is no such thing as 
    the island being haunted and filled with ghosts, as he doesn't 
    believe in such things and intends to use the footage for his college 
    thesis. He in for a boring surprise. On their way to the island, boat 
    captain Carl (a typical extended cameo from Lance Henriksen [<B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad_page2.htm#Unwilling2017">THE
     UNWILLING</A></B> - 2017], even though he's listed as the main star) 
    warns them to get off the island as soon as the bar closes (The 
    island shuts down at Midnight!), because it's not safe to be on the 
    island alone at night, saying that many people have disappeared on 
    the island over the years and were never found. Mike thinks that's 
    just a legend, but he will soon find out it's not. So what does Carl 
    do? That's right, he takes off at midnight and leaves them there with 
    no way to get off the island (of course, cell phones have no service 
    on the island)! Here's what is wrong with the film: It's horribly 
    acted, except for pretty Briana Evigan (<B><A HREF="rites_of_passage_2011.htm">RITES
     OF PASSAGE</A></B> - 2011) who plays local girl Ivy. The three leads 
    have zero chemistry, making it hard to believe they are friends at 
    all. On their first day as bartenders, Jerry spends most of his time 
    drinking shots and making out with all the pretty girls, also making 
    it hard to believe that he's a bartender at all, as we never see him 
    making any drinks. Mike is just a prick, who has no problem making 
    light of Ivy losing her parents and sister when she was a young girl 
    (He doesn't consider bartending a &quot;real&quot; job, something Ivy 
    has been doing for a long time to support herself). Lori is just a 
    pretty girl without much of a personality. There's absolutely no 
    nudity at all (but a lot of girls are in bikinis) and the blood and 
    gore are non-existent, making this film not only a borefest, but 
    uninteresting to the point of watching the clock, hoping it will end 
    soon. The majority of the latter half of the film is shot in total 
    darkness, making everything hard to see, giving you a headache from 
    squinting. The film is also an editor's nightmare, as scenes change 
    from day to night in the blink of an eye. Even Lance Henriksen turns 
    in a performance that isn't up to his normal professionalism. He 
    speaks his lines as if he doesn't believe what he is saying, knowing 
    that it's all meaningless dialogue anyway. Here's what's right about 
    the film: (<I>crickets</I>). Director/producer/screenwriter Marty 
    Murray (his only film as director, at least up to May 2020 when this 
    review was written) has no idea how to pace a film, as this one just 
    slowly (very slowly) reaches the end and nothing is resolved or 
    explained. Maybe that's for the best. If you want to be bored for 82 
    minutes, this is the film for you. Made in 2012, but not released 
    until the end of 2014, which should tell you all you need to know.</FONT></FONT></P>

    good, but it is shot drained mostly of all color (it looks like it

    Eduardo Rodriguez, who made the far superior <B><A HREF="el_gringo_2012.htm">EL

    pretty tense), but I'm getting pretty tired of films draining out all 
    the color, as if they are trying to make a statement. All it is is

    but Kaufman has done so much better (including <B><A HREF="sinners_and_saints_2010.htm">SINNERS
     AND SAINTS</A></B> - 2010) that I thought he should be handed a 
    negative review for this one. Gooding Jr, portrays an accomplished 
    hitman (when we first see him, he is blowing away a group of Russian 
    mobsters from an apartment across the street and I have never seen 
    bullet squibs so large!) and Lundgren is a Hawaiian shirt-wearing guy 
    called &quot;The Wolf&quot;, a mob &quot;collector&quot; who visits 
    people who better have the money when he pays a call (Even if you do 
    have the money, he not above breaking a few fingers just to make a 
    point). Somehow, they both get mixed-up with each other by rival 
    factions of the Russian mob (filmed in the Czech Republic &amp; 
    Louisiana and featuring Louis Mandylor [<B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad_page2.htm#HotelDamned2016">HOTEL
     OF THE DAMNED</A></B> - 2016] as a Russian mob boss) which leads to 
    many bloody gunfights and hand and feet combat. This follows the 
    formula that every ten minutes there should be violence of some kind 
    and Kaufman more than happily supplies it. This is about as violent a 
    film can get and still be Rated R. Unfortunately, the violence leaves 
    little room for much of a story and it all ends rather abruptly and 
    unbelievably. If you like violence, you'll probably love this film. 
    If you like a little meat to go with your potatoes, you are bound to 
    be disappointed. Better than most DTV flicks, but it is still not up 
    to William Kaufman's standards; <B><A HREF="mimesis_2011.htm">MIMESIS</A></B>

    thief wears a fake moustache!) and an old age home (the most 
    interesting part). Both become under siege by hordes of zombies, as 
    the thieves and their hostages join forces and the elderly (one of 
    them happens to be the grandfather of two of the thieves) pull out 
    their cache of automatic weapons to kill the zombies. The funniest 
    scene is a hard-of-hearing old age pensioner trying to outrun zombies 
    in his walker and, while there are plentiful gunshots to the heads, 
    dismemberments and zombie chow-downs, it just fails to connect on 
    either a comedy or horror level. It's not badly made. It's just 
    ordinary; <B><A HREF="death_do_us_part_2012.htm">DEATH DO US PART</A></B> 
    (2012) is your typical slasher whodunnit that contains all the 
    prerequisite ingredients: <B>1.)</B> The film opens with bride-to-be 
    Kennedy (Julia Benson) walking down a deserted road dressed in her 
    bloody wedding dress and veil. The police find her and she recounts 
    what happened (through her veil, which hides her face) for the past 
    week. (Major Clue Alert!!!) <B>2.)</B> Wealthy socialite Kennedy, her 
    groom Ryan (Peter Benson, one of the film's Producers and 
    Co-Screenwriters, along with real-life wife Julia Benson) and their 
    bridegrooms and grooomsmen decide to have a combination 
    bachelor/bachelorette party at a house deep in the woods that Best 
    Man Chet (Kyle Cassie) found listed on Craig's List! <B>3.)</B> They 
    finally get to the house, only to discover that it is looked over by 
    hulking groundskeeper Bo (Dave Collette), who is a strong man of few 
    words and always shows up unexpectedly (making him the film's biggest 
    red herring). <B>4.)</B> Everyone in the six-person party is hiding 
    secrets and deadly situations which could ruin the wedding, like 
    Derrick (Benjamin Ayres) going to jail for two years for something he 
    and Ryan did, but Derrick never gave up his name to the authorities. 
    Now Derrick needs $20,000 to pay off drug dealers and threatens to 
    tell Kennedy unless Ryan ponies it up by stealing it from Kennedy (Of 
    course Derrick is the first to die). Also, and much more major, is 
    that Ryan is screwing Kennedy's best friend Emily (Emilie Ullerup) in 
    the woods, which is viewed by the final member of the group Hannah 
    (Christine Chatelain, who also witnessed the arguement between Ryan 
    and Derrick and is almost the second to die.). Kennedy and Emily are 
    supposed to be going into business together, but she tells Emily that 
    she and Ryan are moving to New York permanently after the wedding and 
    their business partnership will never happen. <B>5.)</B> If you 
    haven't guessed already, someone with a burlap bag over their head is 
    killing members of the party, such as cutting fingers off and 
    planting an axe into Derrick's head, running Emily through with a 
    machete, and other nasty deeds. It is not Bo, because Ryan needlessly 
    kills him. Is it someone from the party or a random killer in the 
    woods? Kennedy stabs Ryan several times and kills him because he 
    tells her he never loved her. <B>6.)</B> Who really cares since this 
    is such an ordinary slasher film? OK, the killer is actually Hannah, 
    whom Kennedy strangles because Hannah has a lesbian crush on her. 
    There is one unseen surprise at the end (but only if you were in that 
    Special Class in school), but nothing worth dredging through the rest 
    of the film for. Director Nicholas Humphries, this being his first 
    feature film after directing over 30 short films, hardly has a sense 
    of pacing and the gore and blood factor are way too low for slasher

    acting aspects are fine, but it is just too damn ordinary for its own 
    good.; <B><A HREF="watch_2012.htm">THE WATCH</A></B> (2012) is one of 
    those films that was so bad that it played for one week in theaters 
    and then completely disappeared until its home video release. Four 
    people (Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill and Richard Ayoade, who 
    should all be ashamed of themselves) form a Neighborhood Watch (the 
    film's shooting title) after a neighbor is murdered and run smack-dab 
    into an alien invasion, who are using the basement of the local 
    CostCo (where Stiller works) to set up an invasion taking over the 
    Earth (with a bowling ball-like device, which our four 
    &quot;heroes&quot; use to blow-up a cow). You would think with a cast 
    like that the film would be a little bit funny, but there's so much 
    talk of &quot;cum&quot; and &quot;sucking my balls&quot;, not to 
    mention a convenient surprise near the finale, that the film loses 
    steam nearly before it starts. What else would you expect from 
    director Akiva Schaffer, who worked as a writer and short digital 
    film director on SNL and directed the even unfunnier <B><A HREF="hot_rod_2007.htm">HOT

    dream&quot; endings and if there isn't a clich&eacute; they haven't 
    mined (excuse the pun), then I don't know if you have watched enough 
    horror films. A group of people drive to a house deep in the woods 
    (Clich&eacute; #1) for some rest and relaxation and end up hitting 
    someone who looks exacly as one of them in the SUV. We then hear such 
    things as &quot;Yes our phones are working. We just don't have 
    service&quot; (Clich&eacute; #2), &quot;Maybe we should split 
    up.&quot; (Clich&eacute; #3) and; Girlfriend to schizophrenic 
    boyfriend: &quot;Did you bring your meds with you?&quot; Boyfriend: 
    &quot;No, I left them back in the car.&quot; (Clich&eacute; #4). 
    After they decide to walk together (breaking Clich&eacute; #3) and 
    find the house, things start to immediately go weird (Cliche #5). 
    Next to the house is a mine with a warning painted on to it 
    (Clich&eacute; #6), that says &quot;Break The Cycle&quot;. They 
    refuse to understand the warning and enter the mine (Clich&eacute; 
    #7) where they see the sign of the &quot;Ouroboros&quot; (fans of the 
    old <B><A HREF="millennium_tv_series_1996-1999.htm">MILLENNIUM</A></B> 
    TV Series [1996-1999] should recognise this symbol: a snake eating 
    its own tail, forming a perfect circle). They press on, not realizing 
    the warning and the symbol are related (Clich&eacute; #8) and two of 
    the friends see their own dead bodies laying in the cave. Everyone 
    hightails it out of there, only to be told by the asshole of the 
    group (Clich&eacute; #9) that he spiked all their drinks with 
    psychedelic mushrooms and they all will be tripping the whole 
    weekend! Needless to say, whenever someone enters the mine, they see 
    exact copies of their friends or themselves and soon the group begins 
    dropping like flies and they all become paranoid whether their 
    friends have been replaced by doubles. It all ends as it begins, with 
    the med-taking boyfriend waking his girlfriend in the SUV and saying 
    &quot;Are you ready?&quot; (Clich&eacute; #10). Director/co-writer 
    Richard Gray has seen too many &quot;Cycle Of Life&quot; horror 
    flicks and half the movie takes place in an underlit mine, so trying 
    to make out what is going on is a chore. Since this is mainly 
    psychological horror, don't look for buckets of blood because you 
    will be disappointed. Don't bother with this one unless you are a

     Presents</A>&quot; line of DVDs. Serial killer businessman Thomas 
    Reddmann (Nicholas Hope), dubbed &quot;The Headhunter&quot; by the 
    Press because of his fondness for chopping off heads, escapes from 
    prison and literally chains six people to their desks at some 
    secluded location. He tells everyone captive he is innocent of the 
    crimes he is accused of and that one of the six is actually the 
    killer. What flummoxed me is that he &quot;interviews&quot; each 
    person and if he doesn't like what they say, he first slices their 
    foreheads like a number (you don't want to get more than four 
    slices), rips out one of his captive's eyes, shoves a pencil through 
    another's hand, suffocates one with a plastic bag or kills and maims 
    in some other gory manner. It turns out that he is not The 
    Headhunter, but the point is moot. He has killed some innocent people 
    to prove his innocence. I really don't see the point in the whole 
    film unless you like torture porn. I will say this, the finale shot 
    did give me a laugh, but you have to put up with the rest of the film 
    to get there. It just wasn't worth it for me, but other people may

    effects over CGI (especially the alien, which looks part Predator, 
    part Alien) and some bloody deaths, you've see this story done 100

    took three people to direct) almost impossible to sit through, 
    especially the final (of five, not counting the wraparound) segment 
    where a father (Executive Producer Corbin Bleu, best known for his 
    starring roles in the Disney <B><A HREF="high_school_musical_2006.htm">HIGH

    as small as ten minutes) is idiotic as hell; <B><A HREF="officer_down_2012.htm">OFFICER
     DOWN</A></B> (2012) is one of the few Stephen Dorff flicks not to 
    make the good list. That's not to say it's awful, because it's not 
    and it has a great cast (Walton Goggins, James Woods, Stephen Lang, 
    AnnaLynn McCord, Dominic Purcell, David Boreanaz and Elisabeth 
    R&ouml;hm), but it's so damn common of a cop thriller, it did nothing 
    for me. Dorff is a police detective that drinks heavily and takes 
    drugs who kills a cop (He doesn't know the guy's a cop until after he 
    is dead and searches the body) and tries to cover it up (He 
    mistakenly believes the cop is sexually abusing his daughter). As you 
    can imagine, it all spirals out of control and ends with an onscreen 
    written explanation that was totally unneeded. Director Brian A.

    starts out with an interesting premise, but quickly deteriorates into 
    standard &quot;torture porn&quot; fare. Brittany Snow plays a girl 
    whose brother needs a life-saving bone marrow transplant. She meets 
    rich guy Jeffrey Combs (who is excellent in his nastiness), who makes 
    a deal with her: Come to his house for dinner and afterward, she and 
    his other dinner guests will play a game, where the winner would get 
    whatever their hearts desire. In Snow's case, it would be the 
    bone-marrow transplant, money to pay for it and her brother's 
    recovery. The dinner party soon turns deadly (Before the games really 
    start, special guest star John Heard, a recovering alcoholoc, is 
    offered $50,000 to drink a bottle of scotch, which he does, but he is 
    shot dead when he decides a little too late that he doesn't want to 
    play the real game), as the members are not allowed to leave and are 
    forced to play a game of &quot;Would You Rather&quot;, such as 
    &quot;Would you rather stab the person on the left in the leg with a 
    knife or strike the gentleman on your right three times in the back 
    with an extremely sharp whipping stick?&quot; It soon turns into the 
    survival of the fittest, as people are forced to cut open their eye 
    with a razor, electrocute themselves or another member at the table, 
    hold their breath underwater for two to four minutes or have a 
    quarter stick of dynamite taped to their hand while the fuse is lit. 
    As with all these films, Snow wins the competition, only to arrive 
    home to find her brother has committed suicide. Director David Guy 
    Levy offers very little new to the genre, but does seem to pull back 
    the camera during the most bloody shots, something unusual for your 
    standard torture porn films; <B><A HREF="detention_of_the_dead_2012.htm">DETENTION
     OF THE DEAD</A></B> (2012) is a comedy mixture of <B><A HREF="breakfast_club_1985.htm">THE
     BREAKFAST CLUB</A></B> (1985) and the zombie genre. And it is 
    ordinary to the extreme. A detention class in a high school library 
    traps a braniac, a stoner, a goth chick, two jocks and a cheerleader 
    while a zombie outbreak happens outside. Besides a couple of gory 
    kills (some of them funny, especially a clarinet spouting blood out 
    of the top a female zombie bandmate's head), the story is nothing but 
    a cliched bunch of characters who spill each other's secrets as they 
    are attacked and their numbers dwindle. I'm getting sick of zombie 
    comedies, and this one doesn't help. At least the similarly-themed <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DanceOfTheDead">DANCE

    (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="bloodworx_2012.htm">BLOODWORK</A></B> - 2012). 
    Hey, did you hear the story of a couple of college buddies who decide 
    to spend their two week Spring Break at an isolated hospital for 
    $3,000 a week where they are about to become guinea pigs for a trial 
    of a new drug? Only it starts turning all those who take the drug 
    turn into&nbsp; murderous zombie-like (the fast-moving kind) 
    creatures with a thirst for blood that can quickly regenerate their 
    wounds, such as gunshots? And it has a pretty downer of a denouement? 
    You have? Well, good, then you don't have to watch this totally 
    ordinary horror flick whose funniest scene is where a poll taker asks 
    all the people who took the drug about their bowel movements and to 
    describe how it came out (hard, soft, fast, slow, runny. etc.?). Add 
    another quick cameo from Eric Roberts for some blow money and you 
    have the perfect combination of a horror flick that offers nothing 
    new to the genre; Nicolas Cage has made more than his share of crappy 
    films, and while <B><A HREF="stolen_2012.htm">STOLEN</A></B> (2012) 
    doesn't steep to those low levels, it is still average at best. Eight 
    years ago, Will Montgomery (Cage), considered one of the world's best 
    thieves, robs a bank in Louisiana of $10 million with the help of a 
    group of criminals. His partner, Vincent (Josh Lucas) gets greedy 
    when he sees a pile of gold in a locked cage and gets shot in the leg 
    by Will when Vincent tries to kill a janitor (Will says, &quot;We 
    don't kill anyone!&quot;). After a car chase in a parking garage, 
    Will is caught (but not before burning the $10 million) and is 
    sentenced to eight years in prison. When his eight years are up, Will 
    is picked up by old FBI nemesis/friend Tim Harlend (Danny Huston), 
    who wants to know where the $10 million is. Will keeps on saying it 
    doesn't exist anymore, <A HREF="stolen_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/stolen 2012 poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>but
     Harlend and his partner Fletcher (Mark Valley) don't believe him. 
    Will never ratted on anyone else who was in on the heist and everyone 
    thinks Vincent is dead. Will tries to reconnect with his daughter 
    Alison (Sami Gayle; a regular on TV's <B><A HREF="blue_bloods_tv_series_2010.htm">BLUE
     BLOODS</A></B>), but she doesn't want anything to do with him and 
    takes a taxi to see her psychiatrist for &quot;abandonment 
    issues&quot;. Little does Will know at the time is that the taxi 
    driver is actually Vincent, who now sports an artificial leg and went 
    to great lengths to make sure everyone thought he was dead. He has 
    kidnapped Alison and wants his share of the $10 million from Will 
    within 12 hours or his daughter is dead. He puts Alison in the 
    soundproof trunk of his taxi an begins to run Will around, while Will 
    has many close calls being captured by Harlend for breaking the law 
    once again. Will has a face-to-face meeting with old gang member Hoyt 
    (a cameo by M.C. Gainey) and gets all the information he needs about 
    Vincent before they get into a hand-to-hand altercation/gunfight, 
    then Harlend and Fletcher kill Hoyt as he opens his front door and 
    Will escapes through the back. In the finale, Will depends on old 
    female gang member Riley Jeffers (Malin Akerman) to help him rob the 
    same bank that he robbed eight years earlier, only this time he comes 
    up with a unique way to melt the gold bars from below and let the 
    molten gold spill into water, turning them into small gold boulders. 
    He delivers the gold to Vincent (filmed at the former Six Flags New 
    Orleans, which was abandoned after Hurricane Katrina), but he sets 
    the trunk on fire with gasoline, which forces Will to drive the taxi 
    into the water and try to save his daughter in the trunk before the 
    car sinks to the bottom. He does, Vincent is stabbed (with his own 
    articicial leg!) and Will throws him in the trunk as the car sinks to 
    the bottom. The film ends happily, with Will, Alison and Riley having 
    a cookout when Will discovers a rock of gold hidden in the back of 
    Riley's pickup. What happens next is not very much a surprise, but it 
    ends the film on a proper note. This is strictly a by-the-book action 
    film, directed by Simon West (the remakes of <B><A HREF="when_a_stranger_calls_2006.htm">WHEN
     A STRANGER CALLS</A></B> - 2006 and <B><A HREF="mechanic_2011.htm">THE
     MECHANIC</A></B> - 2011), which really offers no surprises and most 
    of the action (which are mainly car and foot chases) does not excite. 
    In other words, this is no <B><A HREF="drive_angry_2011.htm">DRIVE ANGRY</A></B> 
    (2011). Originally scheduled to be shown in wide-release in theaters,

    (2012) is one of those cheap shot-on-digital video films with nearly 
    all the color drained out. Freddy (Steven Strait) and Ana (Karolina 
    Wydra) wake up in a hospital after being in a coma for months from a 
    bus accident (we can tell by Freddy's beard growth and the hair on 
    Ana's legs) and there doesn't appear to be anyone else in town (yet 
    they walk like the muscles in their legs haven't atrophied and there 
    isn't any other injury). They drive until they get to a giant weird 
    dark cloud that, they eventually learn, encircles the entire town and 
    is moving inward. It looks like they only have about 3 days left. I 
    know what you are thinking: They are dead or in limbo. Oh, if it were 
    only that easy. It has to do with something Freddy did to Ana when 
    they were children (they never really knew each other), alternate 
    dimensions and being chased by a killer sharp-toothed CGI monster who 
    has the key to save their dimension implanted in its chest. None of 
    it makes any sense and you'll be scratching your head bald trying to 
    figure this whole story out. It looks as if freshman feature film 
    director Ryan Smith took too much peyote when he wrote the 
    mind-numbing screenplay.; <A HREF="assassins_run_2012.htm"><B>ASSASSINS
     RUN</B></A> (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="assassins_run_2012.htm">WHITE SWAN</A></B> 
    - 2012) is one of those ridiculous DTV action films that you have to 
    see to believe. Russian ballet star Maya Letiniskaya (Sofya Skya) is 
    put through hell when her rich big business, but caring, husband 
    Michael (Christian Slater; TV's <B><A HREF="mr_robot_tv_series_2015.htm">MR.
     ROBOT</A></B> - 2015-2019), is killed, her young daughter Nina 
    (Marianna Khalifman) kidnapped and she is thrown in prison for seven 
    years on a trumped-up cocaine charge because people are looking for 
    papers that will make them rich. In an unbelievable turn of events, 
    one of the ugly female prisoners (You know the kind: squished face, 
    fat nose and missing teeth) challenges Maya to a fight (she wants to 
    know where the papers are) in the prison yard and before you can say 
    &quot;Bruce Lee&quot;, Maya has become a martial arts expert, using 
    her ballet moves as a way to beat the snot out of the ugly woman and 
    make her lose yet another tooth. Maya escapes prison and goes on a 
    search for her daughter (Michael told Maya if anything happened to 
    him, only trust Nina's life to Richard [Angus Macfadyen], a 
    harmonica-playing rich man who has been friends with Michael since 
    they were kids) and the papers everyone wants, which will save her 
    daughter's life. She is sure that Michael gave her a clue to where 
    the papers are, so she searches for it while beating the bejesus out 
    of everyone in her way with her new-found ballet-fu knowledge. She 
    finds the clue in some flowers her husband had delivered to the 
    theater (and gets revenge on another rage-filled ballet dancer who 
    wanted the lead in &quot;Swan Lake&quot; by putting a razor blade in 
    her ballet shoe!) and then heads to Richard's house in the United 
    States to help him find Nina, only to learn that Richard is dead. It 
    is not hard to see who the head bad man really is, as directors 
    Robert Crombie &amp; star Sofya Skya spend too much time on plot 
    development and not enough time on the ballet-fu action (Crombie 
    directed the U.S. sections and Skya directed the Russia sections). As 
    a matter of fact, we never see Maya deal with the head bad guy as the 
    film fades to black before it happens. Filmed about 50% in St. 
    Petersburg, Russia. NOTE: The front of the film's <A HREF="assassins_run_2012.htm">DVD
     cover</A> has absolutely nothing to do with the film.; If there is 
    one nice thing I can say about the horrible found footage film <B><A HREF="devils_pass_2012.htm">DEVIL'S
     PASS</A></B> (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="devils_pass_2012.htm">THE DYATLOV 
    PASS INCIDENT</A></B> - 2012) is that it was actually filmed in the 
    mountains of Russia. The fact that it was directed by the once 
    in-demand Renny Harlin (<B><A HREF="prison_1988.htm">PRISON</A></B> - 
    1988; <B><A HREF="die_hard_2_1990.htm">DIE HARD 2</A></B> - 1990) 
    just makes it all the more sadder (My, how the mighty have fallen!). 
    Although supposedly based on a true story (what found footage film 
    isn't?), this film contains all the cliches I hate about films of 
    this type: No music soundtrack (until the end credits); that nauseous 
    sickly green night vision photography; shakey camera work and only 
    giving us a tiny glimpse of the bad things because people are running 
    away with their cameras while being killed (The worst of all sin of 
    found footage films, but I guess there wouldn't be much of a film if 
    they dropped the cameras like normal people would). Legend has it 
    that in 1959, scientist Igor Dyatlov and eight other scientists went 
    to a part of Russia's Ural Mountains nicknamed the &quot;Mountain of 
    the Dead&quot; because of reports of UFOs, Yetis and a portal to 
    another dimension existed in the area. A few weeks later, Dyatlov and 
    his eight comrades were found frozen to death, yet some of them had 
    many broken bones and crushed skulls (it became known as &quot;The 
    Dyatlov Pass Massacre&quot;). The Russian government declares that 
    they all died in an avalanche and closed the case. Yes, and Putin is 
    the most trustworthy man on Earth. Cut to the present, where a 
    psychiatrist/teacher and seven of her students travel to the Mountain 
    of the Dead to document if what the Russian government said was true. 
    They, too, disappear, but all the government could find was one of 
    their digital video cameras, which documented their trip (How on 
    Earth could they find a tiny video camera and no bodies?). Hackers 
    got hold of the video footage and posted it on the Internet, so 
    everyone could watch it. The rest of the film is of that footage. 
    They interview a bunch of Russian residents in the area and an old 
    woman who was alive when it happened says there was more than nine 
    people in Dyatlov's party. I wonder what happened to them? The 
    teachers and students set up base camp at the bottom of the Mountain 
    of the Dead and the next morning they find huge naked footprints in 
    the snow next to their tents. Could it possibly be a Yeti's 
    footprints? They follow the footprints and find a cavern in the side 
    of the mountain. About halfway through the mountain cavern, they find 
    a metal door like you would find on a submarine, with a turning wheel 
    to open and close the door. But why is the door locked on their side? 
    Is it possible that whomever created this door was trying to keep 
    something from escaping? Instead of thinking about the ramifications, 
    they open the door and discover old operating tables and medical 
    instruments that seem to date back to World War II. Suddenly they are 
    attacked by mutants (What we do see of them reminded me of the 
    underground dwellers in <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Descent 2005">THE
     DESCENT</A></B> - 2005) who have the ability to appear and disappear 
    in the blink of an eye. Everyone is killed except for students Holly 
    King (Holly Goss) and Jensen Day (Matt Stokoe) who find another door 
    which seems to have some sort of portal in it. With the creatures 
    closing in on them, Holly &amp; Jensen jump into the portal, not 
    knowing where they will end up. They actually end up frozen stiff 
    dead in the snow at the bottom of the mountain, where Russian 
    soldiers drag their bodies to a secret underground bunker (Another 
    Russian soldier finds their video camera and documents what is 
    happening). The soldiers dragging the bodies want to know if they 
    should put them with the other bodies in their party, but an unseen 
    doctor says no, they are special and must be kept separated from the 
    rest of the bodies. We soon find out why. They are impaled on meat 
    hooks in a barred cage and the Russian soldier places the video 
    camera on a table pointing directly at Holly and Jensen, as they all 
    leave. We then see that Holly and Jensen are not dead but are no 
    longer human. They are turning into the mutant creatures they 
    encountered in the underground laboratory. It seems that if a human 
    uses the portal, they eventually turn into these flesh-eating 
    creatures. THE END. While the story is halfway decent, the found 
    footage technique ruins whatever good the film's screenplay (by 
    Vikram Weet) held. While the snowy scenery is beautiful to look at, 
    the always moving cameras will eventually give you a headache. If 
    Renny Harlin made this as a real film rather than a found footage 
    one, he may be in the different category of this DTV section. But we 
    only get fleeting glances of the mutant creatures due to the shakey 
    camera that is prominent in so many found footage films. This movie 
    had possibilities, but I have to say pass on this one for so many 
    negative reasons. Too bad.</FONT></FONT></P>

     When I hear the name Corey Feldman, the first thing I usually do is 
    avoid any movie he's in. Then I heard that this film, <B><A HREF="6_degrees_of_hell_2012.htm">6
     DEGREES OF HELL</A></B> (2012), was advertised as &quot;The Scariest 
    Film Of 2012&quot; and my interest was piqued. Why do I always fall 
    for this crap? I should have listened to myself the moment I learned<A HREF="6_degrees_of_hell_2012.htm"><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/6 degrees of hell british dvd front3a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    Corey Feldman stars in this. Well, &quot;stars&quot; isn't exactly 
    the truth, even though he is the top-billed actor in the opening 
    credits. His role is actually a supporting one, as he only appears in 
    one location throughout the film (except for the ending), which could 
    have been shot in a day. The film opens with Kellen Hudson 
    (director/producer Joe Raffa) and girlfriend June Galloway (Nicole 
    Cinaglia) partying with Chris Allen (David J. Bonner) and girlfriend 
    Jill Hudson (Jill Whelan), who is Kellen's sister. When Jill learns 
    that June (who is secretly pregnant) is psychic and can contact the 
    dead, a seance is in order, even though June doesn't want to do it. 
    During the seance, a possessed June tells Jill that her life is in 
    danger, scaring the shit out of Jill. When Kellen and June leave to 
    spend some alone time together, Chris goes to get June a glass of 
    water and we then see a creepy demon with chalky white skin behind 
    Jill. The lights go out and Jill screams. When the lights come back 
    on, Jill is dead on the floor and the white-skinned demon is nowhere 
    to be seen. We then see paranormal investigator Kyle Brenner (a 
    vaping Corey Feldman with a ridiculous hairstyle: blonde hair with 
    two strands of black hair that dangle in his face) in a room 
    questioning Deputy Hendricks (Brian Anthony Wilson) about the 
    supernatural happenings that happened in this town and the rest of 
    the film is a giant flashback that deals with Uncle Jack (Brian 
    Gallagher) opening his &quot;Hotel Of Horror&quot; scare attraction 
    (a real haunted house attraction located in Saylorsburg, 
    Pennsylvania) for the Halloween season, only this year it's going to 
    be bigger and better than it ever was before. He is able to get a lot 
    of real haunted items from local psychic Mark Wilkins' collection to 
    use in his haunted hotel. Now this is where the film goes off the 
    rails. Too many characters, including Police Chief Hansen (Faust 
    Checho), who hates Uncle Jack, as well as both Chris and Kellen, are 
    thrown into the film with no explanation, each of them having their 
    own story, until the film becaomes a jumbled mess of supernatural 
    shenanigans and psychic visions that makes little sense. The only 
    plot point that I could make sense of it that one of the haunted 
    items, a blue flower vase, was originally located in Uncle Jack's 
    building, which use to be a psychiatric facility where an evil doctor 
    practiced satanism. When the vase is placed back in the building it 
    originally came from, bad supernatural things begin to happen. On 
    opening Halloween Day, all the people playing monsters in Uncle 
    Jack's Hotel Of Horror become possessed and begin killing the paying 
    customers in various gory ways. There's also a very out of place 
    sequence where June tells Kellen and Chris that she believes Jill is 
    still alive (she hears Jill knocking on her door asking to come in), 
    so Kellen and Chris go to the cemetery where Jill was buried and dig 
    up her coffin, only to find it empty. Chief Hansen catches them, 
    pulls out his gun and tells them they are under arrest, but Kellen 
    hits <A HREF="6_degrees_of_hell_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("152","212") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/6 degrees of hell poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>him
     with a shovel and he falls unconscious into Jill's empty coffin. 
    Then a naked Jill appears, looking like a zombie (or vampire?) and 
    goes to attack her brother and boyfriend, but Kellen shoots her and 
    she falls to the ground. Chris looks at her body and Jill opens her 
    eyes and rises, Kellen shooting wildly at her, accidentally shooting 
    Chris in the throat, killing him. Chief Hanson then rises and it's 
    quite apparent that he's possessed, as his eyes are pitch black 
    (everyone who becomes possessed in this film have black pupils). 
    Kellen then runs away before the Chief can kill him. Every fifteen 
    minutes or so, Kyle appears on screen with Deputy Hendricks and 
    another confusing supernatural story is told, making the film so 
    confusing your head will spin. The film ends with a possessed Uncle 
    Jack and his hired help killing as many paying customers as possible, 
    while June tries to avoid being killed in the building. Kyle finally 
    leaves the interrogation room and walks towards the Hotel Of Horror, 
    a couple of kids saying that the building is evil. Just as he is 
    about to walk in, the film ends. WHAT??? I can't even get the 
    satisfaction of seeing Corey Feldman killed? What a ripoff! The best 
    way to describe this film is meandering. It meanders from character 
    to character, including Uncle Jack's possessed employees portraying 
    monsters such as &quot;The Purifier&quot;, &quot;Clowny&quot;, 
    &quot;Lady Lust&quot; and &quot;Sparky&quot; until you need a 
    scorecard to keep up. There are some good gory kills in the film, but 
    without&nbsp; a decent plot (screenplay by producer B. Harrison 
    Smith), the gore is moot, as we don't give a damn about any of the 
    characters because they are underwritten and uninteresting, 
    especially Corey Feldman's character (and another one, who has black 
    shoe polish under his eyes and talks in riddles). If this was the 
    scariest film of 2012, thank God that year is just a huge blur to me. 
    If you see director Joe Raffa's name on any other film, walk away 
    quickly before your brain becomes trapped in a labyrinth of nothingness.</FONT></FONT></P>

     DTV Genre Films Part 11 (continued):&nbsp; <B><A HREF="power_of_few_2012.htm">THE
     POWER OF FEW</A></B> (2012) is one of those films (from 
    director/writer Leone Marucci) that tells six interconnected stories 
    that always end the same: bullets flying, cars crashing and people 
    dying. The protagonist of the film, a young black girl named Few 
    (Tione Johnson) is seen walking down the street while we hear her 
    complain about biting the inside of her cheek between stories, but it 
    plays an important part in the finale, telling us, the viewers, that 
    even the smallest thing or collection of words can make the outcome 
    of any situation turn out differently. I found it a little too 
    preachy for my tastes (the sub-story about the theft of the Shroud of 
    Turin makes it even more religious), but some people may find 
    enjoyment by Christopher Walken's turn as an ex-TV News anchorman who 
    has fallen on hard times (yet still talks as if he is in the studio) 
    and hangs with a dwarf <A HREF="no_one_lives_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/no one lives poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(Jordan
     Prentiss) who doesn't understand half of what Walken says and 
    appearances by Christian Slater (the hardest working actor in DTV 
    films), Moon Bloodgood, Jesse Bradford, Larry King (as himself) and 
    rapper Juvenile and Anthony Anderson, who take Few's words to heart 
    and change the outcome of what we have seen throughout the entire 
    movie, saving at least ten lives. I would have liked the movie if it 
    pulled back on the religious mumbo jumbo, but I did like the 
    connection of how the action of one can change the outcome of many. 
    Some people may dig this film, but I don't like to be preached to; <B><A HREF="no_one_lives_2012.htm">NO
     ONE LIVES</A></B> (2012) is WWE's second bloody horror film since <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#See No Evil 2006">SEE
     NO EVIL</A></B> (2006; the first one being the average <B><A HREF="day_2011.htm">THE
     DAY</A></B> - 2011), but I'm sad to say that it is nothing but an 
    average blood and guts &quot;torture porn&quot; film with very few 
    surprises. A group of backwoods thieves/killers (led by Lee Tergesen) 
    cause a car accident, unaware that the car is driven by a serial 
    killer (Luke Evans), who has a female captive (Adelaide Clemens) in 
    the trunk of his car who may or may not be suffering from Stockholm 
    Syndrome (she has been missing for 15 months). The serial killer 
    begins dispatching the killers (because one of them killed his female 
    serial killer companion) in various bloody ways in the house the 
    killers hole-up in deep in the woods (the film does go for Hard-R 
    gore, including bullet hits in the eye and head, as well as a shotgun 
    blast that takes a head clean off, so it has that in its favor) and 
    the house is booby-trapped, until just one killer and the female 
    captive are left. This is the type of film where the serial killer 
    doles out punishment to those just as bad as he (and some innocents, 
    too, but so do the other people) and in the end only lets his female 
    captive survive (after removing a tracking device in her body without 
    the use of anaesthesia) and walks away scott-free. Lots of gore for 
    those seeking it, but very little else. I expected a lot more from 
    director Ry&ucirc;hei Kitamura, who gave us the highly unusual <B><A HREF="midnight_meat_train_2008.htm">THE
     MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN</A></B> (2008), which also dealt with a serial 
    killer of a different type. One excellent scene: In a flashback, Luke 
    Evans cuts an artery in his neck and promises Adelaide Clemens the 
    key to the dungeon they are in if she saves him. If not, she will 
    starve to death. She saves Evans by sewing up his artery, but can't 
    find the key. Evans tells her there never was one because the door 
    was never locked! She never thought of checking the door. A piece of 
    great filmmaking in an otherwise torture film.; <B><A HREF="deadfall_2012.htm">DEADFALL</A></B> 
    (2012) is one of those crime thrillers with a great cast that, 
    unfortunately, goes nowhere fast, thanks to director/screenwriter 
    Stefan Ruzowitzky (<B><A HREF="anatomy_2000.htm">ANATOMY</A></B> - 
    2000). Brother and sister stickup team (Eric Bana and Olivia Wilde) 
    are on the run from a casino heist in the middle of winter (filmed in 
    Quebec, Canada), when they kill a state trooper. They decide to split 
    up (huh?) and the sister is saved from freezing to death by a 
    recently released ex-con (<B><A HREF="sons_of_anarchy_tv_series.htm">SONS
     OF ANARCHY</A></B>'s Charlie Hunnam) and he takes her to his 
    disapproving parents' (Kris Kristofferson and Sissy Spacek) house for 
    Thanksgiving. Meanwhile, the brother is tearing a swath of death and 
    destruction throughout the area (he even gets one of his fingers cut 
    off), killing a Native American, a mother and another cop, while 
    being chased by cop Kate Mara and her asshole boss, the sheriff 
    (played by Treat Williams), who also happens to be her father and 
    hates the fact that his daughter will soon become an FBI agent. It 
    all leads to the eventual showdown at the parents' house, where sides 
    will be picked and people will die. This would be a really good film 
    if there weren't a few gaping plot holes that even a three year-old 
    could spot; <B><A HREF="butcher_boys_2012.htm">THE BUTCHER BOYS</A></B>

    says he based his script on the new film on Jonathan Swift's 1729 
    novel, &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot;. Yeah, right.). A girl named 
    Sissy (Ali Faulkner) goes out with her brother and two friends Ken 
    and Barbie (c'mon now!), to celebrate the brother's birthday at a 
    fancy restaurant. On their way home, a series of events happens where 
    they piss-off a group of cannibals called The Bone Boys (even Latin 
    gangs and the cops are scared of them) and after killing the other 
    three, they chase Sissy for what seems like a lifetime before they 
    finally catch her. We then meet the entire clan (in a building called 
    &quot;Swift's&quot;) and one of the gang peforms a vaginal 
    examination on her to see if she is able to produce children, while 
    the English-speaking (as in England) head of the family and a 
    chained-up Leatherface clone wait for the results. It is then torture 
    porn from that moment on and when Sissy does escape, it is taken 
    right out of the finale of the original, except she is rescued by two 
    Latino's in a lowrider while the Leatherface creature plants an axe

    horror&quot; film, but you'll have to go through a lot of romance 
    before you get to the horror and I'm not really sure whether it 
    should be called horror at all. This is actually a lesbian love story 
    between tomboy Jack (Riley Keough) and strange newly lesbian Diane 
    (Juno Temple), who was raped by a bunch of frat boys who taped the 
    whole incident and put it on the internet. Everytime Jack &amp; Diane 
    get close to making love, Diane chickens out and then she has 
    nightmares about turning into some rubber-suited monster (by Gabe 
    Bartalos) and eating Jack's internal organs (the first instance 
    happens 1 hour and 19 minutes into the film!). There is some nice 
    animation sequences by the Quay Brothers (the opening titles and some 
    other super-quick sequences throughout the film's 96 minutes, but it 
    really does nothing to enhance the film) and a nice music soundtrack 
    (Kylie Minogue has a song and also a role), but most time it's just a 
    boring love story between two young women. Those expecting much more 
    are bound to be disappointed; <B><A HREF="apartment_1303_2012.htm">APARTMENT

     ghost story of 2007 with the same name</A>, but with the added bonus 
    of 3D (it never got many 3D showings since it was one of those films 
    that played in a few theaters for a week while it played 
    simultaneously on VOD and then quickly was shown on the Showtime 
    networks). This is your typical bad remake of an uneven Japanese 
    flick about a suicidal ghost that haunts the apartment number in the 
    title, which a new resident (Julianne Michelle) rents to get away 
    from her alcoholic mother (Rebecca De Mornay). When the ghost throws 
    the girl off the balcony, killing her, her sister (Mischa Barton) 
    decides to investigate the apartment's history. When you see a ghost 
    sitting on a toilet, you know that a film is desperate for attention. 
    It's about as boring and predictable as a pimply-faced kid getting a 
    date with a supermodel. Nothing happens and you go home disappointed. 
    Don't waste your time; <B><A HREF="no_tell_motel_2012.htm">NO TELL MOTEL</A></B>

    adults whose car breaks down and they are forced to stay in an 
    abandoned motel (no cell phone service of course) that is haunted by 
    a violent little ghost girl named Angela (Rileigh Chalmers). The 
    little ghost begins killing the unwanted guests one-by-one while 
    Megan (Chalie Howes) tries to figure out why Angela is so mad. The 
    result comes as no surprise and director Brett Donowho (<B><A HREF="haunting_at_silver_falls_2013.htm">A
     HAUNTING AT SILVER FALLS</A></B> - 2013) offers the viewer nothing 
    in the way of suspense to keep us from watching the clock and waiting 
    for the film to finally end. Staying at a Super 8 Motel is more of an 
    adventure; <B><A HREF="girls_against_boys_2012.htm">GIRLS AGAINST BOYS</A></B> 
    (2012) is a predictable revenge thriller about a girl named Lulu 
    (Nicole LaLiberte) who gets raped so she goes to the police to report 
    it. The young policeman treats her like dirt (He says something like, 
    &quot;You look OK to me.&quot;), so she gets the idea of making men 
    pay with their lives for their misdeeds towards women. She first 
    starts out with the young cop. She comes on to him and soon they are 
    in a motel room with him blindfolded and handcuffed to the bed. Lulu 
    then takes his gun shoves it up his ass amd pulls the trigger 
    (luckily for us, it is not shown). Lulu then adopts co-worker Shae 
    (Danielle Panabaker). She is crying uncontrollably at a nightclub 
    because she has just been dumped by her married boyfriend, who 
    decides to work it out with his wife for the sake of their young 
    daughter (Shae didn't even know he had a daughter.). These two women 
    then go out on a spree to kill men, but when Shae cannot kill her 
    married boyfriend, Lulu does it for her. To make a long story short, 
    Lulu is actually a lesbian who has the hots for Shae and when she 
    comes on to her, Shae cuts her deep in the stomach with a sword and 
    Lulu bleeds out in the kitchen and dies. The next time we see Shae, 
    she is at a nightclub talking to a girl who has just been abused by 
    her boyfriend. The circle starts all over again. Director/writer 
    Austin Chick offers nothing new to this well-worn genre and you can

     DOLLAR CROCODILE</A></B>). Unlike those terrible films from the 
    Asylum, I have never seen such good CGI in a film of this type. 
    Unfortunately the story sucks. It concerns an aggravating woman named 
    Yan Wen (Barbie Hsu) who has her purse with 100,000 Euros 
    (approximately One Million Dallars according to the film) in it 
    swallowed by a 37-foot crocodile named Amao. She bitches, moans and 
    generally acts a pain in the ass to policeman Wang Beiji (GuoTao), 
    who has an equally aggravating young son . It seems like gangsters 
    bought out a crocodile exhibit (including Amao) in Taiwan and shipped 
    them off to Italy (but we never see one Italian person, only 
    Orientals!) as food for rich people. There's not blood or gore in 
    this film because it is only rated PG-13, but the CGI is quite 
    impressive. I dare you to tell the difference between CGI and the 
    real thing in this film. It's not enough for me to give this film a 
    positive review because the English dubbing and the frequent comedy 
    elements are annoying, but this being a Chinese film, there is a bad 
    taste scene of the officer's young son bare-ass naked in the film. It 
    could not happen here, at least without it getting an R-Rating. The 
    best part of the film is when Bald Liu (Shi Zhaoqi) the owner of the 
    crocodile exhibit in Taiwan who controls (and loves) Amao by tapping 
    a stick towards the end of the film and it ends on quite an emotional 
    note with both Bald Liu and Amao lying next to each other. Otherwise 
    it is just a mild horror film with unwelcome bits of humor.;</FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"> </FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B><A HREF="tasmanian_devils_2012.htm">TASMANIAN

    alcoholic mother and her three daughters are on their way to pick up 
    their husband/father, who is returning home after doing his duty in 
    the Middle East when they get caught in the middle of a tornado and 
    take shelter in a strange storm cellar. Besides not being able to get 
    out of the cellar (the elderly mother and her police officer son have 
    locked them in and they are more than what they seem), there is some 
    kind of monster chained in the storm cellar that begins to pick off 
    the mother and some of the daughters when it breaks its chains. The 
    last surviving daughter, Jennifer (Meg Saricks), manages to break out 
    of the storm cellar and finds that the elderly mother is the leader 
    of a clan of monsters, including her son. She tries to escape (and 
    shoots the elderly mother right between the eyes), but her fate is 
    left unknown. The next morning, the camera pans on her cellphone in a 
    field, while Dad gets off the plane and reads the text messages on 
    the phone. What he reads makes him drop his bag and leaves the film 
    wide open for a sequel which, according to IMDb, is eventually going 
    to be made. Director/co-producer/co-screenwriter Patrick Rea (who 
    mainly directs short films) gives us good scenes of the monster's 
    horrific face and also some grisly murders, but the film is more talk 
    than horror. Hopefully, if the sequel is made, soldier Daddy will get 
    all Marine on their asses and give these monsters a good fight. As it 
    stands now, this film may or may not entertain you, but for God's

    gorilla suit!), except Mauro slowly going mad. Not only do we not get 
    a good look at the creature, the film ends with the creature(s) 
    dragging Mauro away to his death, using that old found footage 
    standby: With the camera lying on the ground where we see nothing, 
    but we hear Mauro's screams. Unless you are a Bigfoot completist, 
    there is absolutely no reason why you should put yourself through 77 
    minutes of pure filmic hell (and that is not a recommendation). No 
    found footage flick has done Bigfoot justice...yet, but I'm holding 
    out hope. Directed, executive produced and co-written by Christian

     AWAKENED</A></B> (2012) is one of those insufferable DTV flicks that 
    starts out interesting and then completely falls apart. In 1809, a 
    alien spacecraft crashes in the deep woods. Cut to the present, where 
    farmer Hank Taylor (Will Marchetti) is removing a dead tree stump 
    from his property. As the tree stump falls to the ground, the hole 
    reveals an alien metal that is marked with strange symbols. When Hank 
    touches it, it reanimates three deadly aliens that go on a killing 
    spree. Top-Secret Project Dreamland head, Maddox (Robert Picardo; <B><A HREF="dont_blink_2014.htm">DON'T
     BLINK</A></B> - 2014) sends his three MIBs to kill the aliens before 
    they make themselves known to the public. At the same time, niece 
    Nicole (Chrissy Mazzeo) decides to visit her Aunt Ruby (Maya Mahrer) 
    and Uncle Hank and brings along her surgeon boyfriend Theo (Peter 
    Quartaroli, who has the habit of curling his upper lip over his front 
    teeth), who is married and wants it to remain a secret. Before long, 
    everything electrical stops working at the farm, including cars, as 
    the aliens savagely kill everyone in sight (Theo dies a nasty death, 
    having his lower jaw removed from his head). Oh, did I mention that 
    the deputy, Andrew Hubbard (Jonathan Leveck), still loves Nicole? I 
    guess we can see how all of this will end. Directed and written by 
    the duo of Adrian DeLude &amp; Eric Nichols (This short review was 
    written in 2019 and they have yet to make another film!) without an 
    ounce of urgency or talent, this is basically nothing but a series of 
    kill scenes, many of them in total darkness. It's clear that 
    &quot;name&quot; actor Robert Picardo only shot a day's worth of 
    scenes (usually talking on the phone), but he does shows up at the 
    end in the woods and shoots and kills the last remaining alien with a 
    high-powered rifle (saving Nicole and Andrew) and says, &quot;The old 
    man still has it!&quot; And then the film ends! Find something else 
    to watch, like the video of your colonoscopy. <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">NOTE:</FONT></B>

    Don't you believe it!;<A NAME="ChemicalPeel2012"></A> <B><A HREF="chemical_peel_2012.htm">CHEMICAL
     PEEL</A></B> (2012) is one of those films you'll want to like, but 
    major characters do and say the most hurtful things imaginable, 
    you'll want to strangle them with your bare hands. A bunch of female 
    friends have a bachelorette party for bride-to-be Angela (Arielle 
    Brachfeld) at a house in the middle of nowhere, but there is much 
    tension between Angela and Rae (Natalie Victoria) since Rae 
    accidently killed Angela's sister five years earlier in a car 
    accident in which Rae was the driver and the sister was a passenger. 
    It was no fault of Rae's but Angela seems to hold a grudge forever. 
    In the middle of the party, they hear a loud explosion and soon a 
    strange mist begins filling the air, a mist that makes everyone cough 
    like a lifetime smoker. Then the phones and TV no longer have 
    signals, making the girls wonder what is going on. The TV suddenly 
    comes on long enough to warn them that there was a train accident and 
    a mixture of chemicals were released in a fog that will kill anyone 
    who is outside. They are warned to stay inside and wait for help. 
    That's basically the plot of the film, but Angela and guest Jordin 
    (Stephanie Greco) are such major cunts, they give all cunts a bad 
    name. All Angela can think about is getting married and making Rae's 
    life as humiliating as possible and Jordin walks around in a 
    psychotic blur telling everyone that they are going to die and saying 
    to Angela that her groom-to-be is already dead (Oh, and Angela stole 
    the groom away from Rae when they were seeing each other!). Plot 
    twists happen when one of the girls, Deb (Lony'e Perrine), finds her 
    newborn baby dead and steals their only car, leaving the girls 
    trapped in the house waiting for help that isn't coming. Still 
    another plot twist happens when another girl, Elise (Lacy Fisher) 
    takes a shower to wash the chemical off her body, only to discover 
    that water and this chemical don't mix, causing the skin to melt off 
    her body, leaving nothing but a pile of bones in the bathtub! Still 
    another twist happens when a hunter named Howard (Ruben Pla) enters 
    the house and Angela accidentally shoots him in the head with his own 
    rifle (In Angela's defense, Howard said the gun wasn't loaded!). 
    While there are some good, gooey special effects, the film fails 
    mainly due to Angela and Jordin's behavior, which is maddening to say 
    the least. Why anyone would have them as friends is beyond me, but 
    don't worry, they both meet a fate worse than death (Angela and 
    Jordin get into a catfight, causing a fishbowl to fall off a table 
    and break over Jordin's head, melting her face off her skull. Angela 
    steals the only gasmask in the house and leaves, but she falls down 
    and breaks the glass eyepiece and the mist eats away her eyes.). The 
    only one to survive is Rae, but when a lawyer for the chemical 
    company tries to get her to sign a non-disclosure statement in the 
    hospital, she stabs him in the neck repeatedly with his own pen, 
    killing him! I've told you all the film's major plot points, so I 
    saved you 90 minutes of your life. You can thank me later. Directed

     The tagline for the found footage film <B><A HREF="specter_2012.htm">SPECTER</A></B> 
    (2012) is &quot;What Really Happened?&quot;, but after watching this 
    insufferable film, all I can say is, &quot;Damned if I know!&quot; 
    This is one of those found footage films that starts out decently 
    enough, but the further along it goes, the harder it is to see what 
    is actually going on, because 75% of the film is shot in total 
    darkness (At least it's not that sickly green night vision, but the 
    nearly black &amp; white night vision that is drained of all color. 
    It's a toss-up as to which is worse.) and the only light available is 
    what it attached the camera and the battery is running low. All I 
    kept thinking was the camera was going to fail just as things become 
    interesting again and damned if I was correct! Toss in characters 
    either too disgusting to root for or too vanilla to care about and 
    what you get is a &quot;film&quot; that doesn't have one single thing 
    going in its favor. The basic plot is this: The seaside town of 
    Midground has just experienced a tsunami caused by a 9.2 earthquake 
    in the ocean floor, forcing a near total evacuation of this tourist 
    town. That is except for all the young people who were expecting a 
    festival in town with fireworks, which the town is still holding 
    (WTF?!?). Two young adults, Chase Lombardi (co-screenwriter Joe 
    Patron), who escaped to Midground a year ago after raping a girl in 
    his hometown and Chris Benadictus<A HREF="specter_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/specter 2012 amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    (director/producer/co-screenwriter/editor/cinematographer/production 
    designer/special &amp; digital effects/makeup artist/sound effects 
    editor/camera operator Jordan Graham), who just got a new video 
    camera and uses it everywhere he goes, are going to have a party at 
    Chase's place, but first they have to score enough pills of an 
    unnamed new drug for everyone attending the party. Once they get the 
    drugs and have the party, everyone partakes in the pills, none of 
    them knowing what the pills do or how it will affect them (Even I 
    never did drugs unless I knew what they were, but these young adults 
    are so clueless here that one of them, Jeff [Michael Daniel], a 
    budding kickboxer, swallows three of them!). Chase goes off with 
    Temperance (Carey Nieto) for some alone time in the sack (Chris 
    secretly films it!), while everyone else abandons the party and heads 
    for the festival. The only ones to stay are Chris, Temperance and 
    Jeff, but when the ground starts to shake and rumble and there's a 
    light show in the sky, Temperance disappears and Jeff acts like a 
    zombie, just staring into the distance. They try to call some of 
    their friends, where one girl tells them not to come to town, but 
    before she can tell them why she screams and the phone goes dead. 
    Then all the cliches from cheap horror films begin to happen, such as 
    Chase's car refusing to start and the camera glitching everytime 
    something approaches them. In the distance Chase and the gang see a 
    light show happening in town. Is it an alien invasion, something 
    supernatural or hallucinations from the effects of the drugs they are 
    taking? Damned if I know, because this film never tells us. What we 
    get is a forest fire causing Chase, Chris and zombie Jeff to travel 
    down underground tunnels to make it to town. Once they get there, 
    they see a completely naked man standing in the middle of the road, 
    staring off into the distance, who explodes in a hail of blood when a 
    light from above hits him. There are also quick shots of a group of 
    naked people standing in a single file, looking at our group. Who or 
    what are what are they? Like I already said, damned if I know, as 
    there isn't even a hint of what is actually going on in town, as it 
    is completely deserted and their friends are nowhere to be found. 
    What I can tell you is that Jeff's eyes go completely black, but why 
    they do is also never explained, as he walks into the ocean in a 
    zombie-like state and drowns (after throwing Chase into the ocean off 
    a railway bridge!). The finale of the film is completely infuriating 
    because Chris' camera goes dead just as everything is going to be 
    explained and the audience is left guessing what happens to him and 
    Chase, but like I said, these are people we don't care about, as one 
    of them is a rapist and the other is his friend. It is evident that 
    Jordan Graham bit off more than he could chew, taking on too many 
    jobs to notice that his film makes no sense. Made with a paltrey 
    budget of $1,300 and looking it, there's absolutely nothing 
    interesting about this film. It's a perfect example of why I hate 
    found footage flicks. Anyone with a video camera and Apple computer 
    editing tools (and this film proudly displays that fact in the 
    closing credits!) thinks they can make a film and most of them fail 
    at it, which is why Graham didn't direct another film until 2019 and 
    it is a parttial found footage film in which he once again wears too 
    many hats. I honestly don't see why there are Found Footage fanatics 
    out there and I wish someone would explain it to me. For every good 
    FF flick, there are at least fifty others that will bore you to 
    death. This film is one of them.;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A NAME="Bad2013"></A><B><A HREF="under_the_bed_2012.htm">UNDER
     THE BED</A></B> (2013). I really wanted to like this film since it 
    was directed by Steven C. Miller, who made the excellent <B><A HREF="odds_n_ends.htm#SilentNight2012">SILENT
     NIGHT</A></B> (2012) remake, but the fact is that this film is a slow-moving
     affair that doesn't really come to life until the last ten minutes. 
    It also makes very little sense. The story concerns a troubled kid 
    (Jonny Weston), who returns home after two years living in Florida 
    with his Aunt. It seems he started a fire in his house that killed 
    his mother, but the fact is that there is a creature living under his 
    younger brother's (Gattlin Griffith) bed. When he returns home to 
    meet his new stepmother (Musetta Vander) and agitated father (Peter 
    Holden), the creature begins acting up once again with his father 
    refusing to believe it. It takes nearly 80 minutes for the creature 
    to rear its ugly head and, until then, we have to put up with plenty 
    of jump scares and actions by the father that defy description (like 
    removing the light bulb from the younger brother's bedroom ceiling 
    light fixture, forcing him to sleep in the dark). Once the creature 
    does make its appearance (monster suit by Vincent J. Gaustini and his 
    crew) and begins killing the tiny cast in very graphic ways (a stark 
    difference from the rest of the film, which plays more like an 
    Afterschool Special), the film finally comes to life, but it is short-lived.
     The screenplay, by Eric Stolze, seems more interested in the tight 
    relationship between the two brothers (and really gives us no 
    background on the creature, except to speculate that it lives under 
    the bed by eating the dead skin cells of the younger brother!)<A HREF="pawn_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pawn poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="214" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    and the father's half-assed futile attempts to make this a 
    &quot;normal&quot; family and that is all fine and dandy, but don't 
    go advertising this as a horror film and only show the horror during

    movie. When Fessenden does films independently his own way (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Wendigo">WENDIGO</A></B>

    2006), they can be sublime slices of psychological horror, but within 
    the TV confines, he is required to have something shocking happen 
    every 15 minutes. This film concerns a group of six tightly-knit 
    older teens (including the pre-requisite gay teen) who decide to take 
    a rowboat to an island on a lake that is known to have something 
    under the water that kills people. After a stern warning by Mr. Parks 
    (Mark Margolis, the only recognizable face in this film) not to go 
    onto the lake and ignoring it, the teens are soon attacked by a giant 
    fish with huge sharp teeth (the fish is based on fact) and lose their 
    oars in the middle of the lake. Soon they become fish food 
    one-by-one, until the rest decide who to sacrifice by throwing them 
    in the water and trying to make an escape to the island. Looks like 
    they weren't as tightly-knit as they thought they were. The only 
    surprise Fessenden offers us (besides the great-looking killer fish) 
    is killing the one teen we think is going to make it in the middle of 
    the film. The rest of the film is your usual teen-in-peril flick. One 
    gets the feeling Fessenden (who is a guru to many young filmmakers 
    and usually makes cameos in their films) took this film because it is 
    his first movie directorial effort since <B><A HREF="last_winter_2006.htm">THE
     LAST WINTER</A></B>. It's not a badly-made film, but when you see 
    Fessenden's name attached to anything, you expect a whole lot more 
    than what this movie delivered, including the usual downbeat ending; <B><A HREF="nothing_left_to_fear_2013.htm">NOTHING
     LEFT TO FEAR</A></B> (2013) is the kind of horror film that just 
    infuriates me. It's a confusing tale about a new pastor (James 
    Tupper) and his family arriving in a small Louisiana farm town and 
    it's apparent from the start that they have a target painted on their 
    backs. Some stringy-haired demon called The Watcher (John 'Mac' 
    Showalter) who oozes black goo and can open his mouth real wide (just 
    like in all those Japanese horror films), wants to kill the kids, 
    because the town is some kind of gateway from Hell to Earth and if 
    the townspeople don't sacrifice at least one of the pastor's family 
    to stop the demon, all Hell will be raised on Earth. So, from the 
    beginning, you know the new family doesn't stand a chance and the 
    story ends with another new family arriving in town a year later and 
    the only surviving member of the pastor's family (Rebekah Brandes) 
    looks at one of the new teenage boys as the new victim for the town's 
    sacrifice. It's not scary or well-made (the photography is way too 
    dark). What's scarier is that Anne Heche and Clancy Brown got 
    involved in acting in this and musician Slash (also one of the 
    Producers) was co-responsible for the music score. It sounds like 
    hundreds of other supernatural films crowding the market. Director 
    Anthony Leonardi III and screenwriter Jonathan W.C. Mills definitely 
    have watched too many Japanese horror films for their own good; <B><A HREF="battle_of_the_damned_2013.htm">BATTLE

    creatures (Lundgren keeps calling them zombies, but is corrected by a 
    male counterpart he picks up on his travels that they are infected 
    people, not zombies). About halfway through, Lundgren and the small 
    group he has rescued are helped by robots (If the robots look

    small distance and shoot some more. There's not much more to the film 
    except that, so if you like watching infected people (&quot;THEY'RE

    along with new husband Derek (Cam Gigandet), spend their honeymoon on 
    a small island just a boat ride from Puerto Rico. They meet a local 
    who takes them to a disco, where Ava gets into a brawl with men and

    teacher, played by Stephen Lang) to locate her husband and soon she 
    is facing off with the goons of island crimelord Silvio Lugo (Amaury

    just too much for them. The reason for her husband's kidnapping is 
    the only surprise in the entire film and Trejo's role is also a 
    surprise, but the screenplay, by James Robert Johnston and Bennett 
    Yellin, is full of too many action cliches to make this film stand 
    out from most other action films (except for a head shot bullet hit 
    spraying blood on the camera lens). Hopefully, Gia Carano finds the 
    right action film vehicle to display all her strengths with a good 
    story attached to it, but this is not that film. This is another one 
    of those movies that played a limited one week theatrical/VOD before 
    being quickly dumped on disc and cable TV; <B><A HREF="heatstroke_2013.htm">HEATSTROKE</A></B> 
    (2013) is a totally predictable thriller whose only saving graces are 
    the South African scenery, animals and Peter Stormare's performance. 
    Stephen Dorff portrays Paul, a divorcee and expert on hyenas, who has 
    to take his troubled 13 year-old daughter Josie (Maisie Williams) 
    with him to Africa because his ex-wife found out she was hanging with 
    the wrong crowd (drugs are involved) and she needs to get away from 
    them. The problem is that Paul is bringing along girlfriend Tally 
    (Svetlana Metkina) on the trip and Josie can't stand her guts because 
    she wants her father and mother to get back together. Josie is a real 
    pain in the ass on the trip (really, I myself wanted to bean her with 
    a baseball bat!), so Paul makes the long drive to Johannesburg so 
    Josie can hop on a plane back home while Tally minds the camp. 
    Tally's camp is attacked by a pack of hyenas, breaking her satellite 
    phone and deleting her food and water supply, so she has to walk to 
    the nearest watering hole. While walking, she discovers that Paul is 
    dead, shot in the head and Josie is injured in the overturned 
    vehicle. It seems Paul ran into a couple of arms runners who were 
    dehorning a dead rhino they just killed and they shot Paul in the 
    head while he was backing up the vehicle at high speed to get away. 
    Tally and Josie must walk the harsh environment to the nearest 
    population and run into the camp of Mallick (Stormare), who is the 
    leader of the arms smugglers. It then turns into a cat-and-mouse game 
    and the ending is telegraphed from nearly the beginning, where Tally 
    and Josie must depend on each other in order to survive and become 
    friends in the process. There is nothing here but pretty scenery, 
    some nice hyena photography and Stormare's usual batshit performance 
    to make this film even slightly watchable. Directed and co-written by 
    Evelyn Purcell (<B><A HREF="borderline_2002.htm">BORDERLINE</A></B> -

    (2013) is not your ususal clown horror film because it takes place at 
    an abandoned amusement park (in Budapest, Hungary; it isn't abandoned 
    in real life and is still being used) with really weird non-CGI 
    monsters (Tim Curry voices the titled clown, his first since the TV 
    mini-series <B><A HREF="stephen_kings_it_1990.htm">IT</A></B> - 
    1990). The human acting is simply horrid (especially the head bad guy 
    [Michael Cannell-Griffiths] who challenges the dork to enter the 
    park), but at least the unusual monsters that occupy the park are 
    interesting and are voiced by Lance Henriksen (as Braineater), Brad 
    Dourif (as Worm Creature), Michael Winslow (as Stomachcrumble) and a 
    very funny Sean Young as a giant spider named Nelly. Too bad the 
    movie made so little sense. It would have been better without any 
    humans. Directed/produced/written by Bal&aacute;zs Hatvani, who shows 
    bizarre style and could make a winner with the right material. 
    Originally shown in 3D and sprinkled with physical references to 
    other horror films. I almost gave this a positive review, but I 
    simply couldn't overlook Griffiths' awful acting; <B><A HREF="always_watching_a_marble_hornets_story_2013.htm">ALWAYS
     WATCHING: A MARBLE HORNETS STORY</A></B> (2013) is a found footage 
    disaster based on a 2009 YouTube series. In this case, a three person 
    news crew are doing a story about what happens after homes are 
    foreclosed, when they come upon a house fully furnished, as if the 
    family just up and disappeared. There are also symbols on the walls 
    with crosses encased in a circle (like The Zodiac Killer use to 
    leave) and come upon a box of digital videotapes which the 
    foreclosure people let them keep. They discover that the family in 
    the house were haunted by a man in a suit and tie with no face 
    (played by Doug Jones; <B><A HREF="raze_2013.htm">RAZE</A></B> - 
    2013) who can't be seen by the naked eye, but can be seen on camera. 
    As you can guess, our three person news crew (and a dog) are being 
    chased by the faceless well-dressed man (who leaves his circular mark 
    on all their bodies, including the dog). But since this is a found 
    footage film, we rarely get a look at the faceless man, as the camera 
    shakes wildly whenever he shows up (followed by the found footage 
    trope of the tape going haywire just before he shows up) and the 
    story is boring as hell and hardly bloody at all even though it is 
    Rated R. If you ever see James Moran's name as director on a film, do 
    yourself a favor and just skip it. Look for the late Angus Scrimm in 
    a very tiny cameo as a mental patient. Poor Angus and Doug. They 
    shouldn't have to do crap like this. Not released until 2015; I 
    really wanted to like <B><A HREF="compound_fracture_2013.htm">COMPOUND

    until he was killed off), but the story is so convoluted and 
    confusing (besides the nice play on words in the title), that I 
    really can't recommend it. Son Michael Wolffsen (Tyler Mane, who was 
    Michael Myers in Rob Zombie's <B><A HREF="halloween_2007.htm">HALLOWEEN</A></B> 
    [2007] and <B><A HREF="halloween_2_2009.htm">HALLOWEEN II</A></B> 
    [2009], as well as being a co-writer and co-producer of this film), 
    who left home as a teenager (after a nasty incident not made clear in 
    the beginning), returns to the family home as an adult with his 
    fiancee Juliette (Renae Geerlings, Mane's real-life wife and 
    co-writer of this film) and annoying nephew Brandon (Alex Saxon), 
    after learning about the death of his sister. Michael finds it 
    strange that the family home was turned into some kind of compound 
    and when he is reunited with his father Gary (Watson, the best thing 
    about this film), until he discovers why. According to Michael's 
    stepmother Annabelle (Leslie Easterbrook, who was Mother Firefly in 
    Rob Zombie's <B><A HREF="devils_rejects_2005.htm">THE DEVIL'S REJECTS</A></B> 
    - 2005), Gary is suffering from the early onsets of Alzheimers and is 
    slowly losing his memory. Gary thinks the family is cursed and set up 
    a supernatural safe room where they can be protected from a past dead 
    relative named William (Derek Mears, who was Jason Voorhees in the <B><A HREF="friday_the_13th_2009.htm">FRIDAY
     THE 13TH</A></B> [2009] remake), who can only be seen by those who 
    have the Wolffsen scar on their wrist. Turns out Gary may not be as 
    mad as stepmom makes him out to be, as the nearly indestructable 
    William begins to attack the cast, throwing them around like 
    ragdolls. Why? You got me. The screenplay never makes it clear, 
    except that Gary has cameras throughout the inside and outside of the 
    house that he can view on monitors in his safe room (William can be 
    seen on camera by anyone), which is adorned with supernatural 
    symbols. Brandon also has a secret which is revealed and Juliette 
    can't see William because she is not a Wolffsen (but Gary remedies 
    that). The film is nothing but a series of attacks by the imposing 
    William, while Michael tries to understand how his sister died, heal 
    the rift between him and his father and kill William. There's not 
    much meat on the bone here, so don't go looking for any social 
    commentary on family relations (Gary likes to hit women and was 
    always hitting Michael's mother until she moved out and Michael moved 
    in with her, until her death). I really couldn't tell you what the 
    curse is about because, try as I might, I just couldn't make any 
    sense of it, because director/cinematographer (that's his real trade) 
    Anthony J. Rickert-Epstein and writers Mane &amp; Geerlings offer 
    little to cling to. Look for a fleeting cameo by Daniel Roebuck. 
    Otherwise, all this film has to offer is some supernatural 
    mumbo-jumbo and some bloody violence (which includes broken bones and 
    a hacked-off hand). I really, really wanted to like this just for the<A HREF="willow_creek_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/willow creek poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="214" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>

    have to draw the line when it comes to his &quot;found footage&quot; 
    movie <B><A HREF="willow_creek_2013.htm">WILLOW CREEK</A></B> (2013). 
    It is about a couple (Bryce Johnson and Alexie Gilmore) trying to 
    find out if Bigfoot is real and all it is is video footage of the 
    couple arguing, interviewing people who do and don't believe in the 
    existence of Bigfoot (some of them real people) and holding each 
    other in a tent as they hear noises outside in the night. Not once do 
    we ever see a Bigfoot (all we get is a fleeting glimpse of a 
    floppy-breasted missing woman in grannie panties at the end) and the 
    entire film is boring. There is some snappy dialogue (especially when 
    the girl makes fun of all those &quot;Hail to the V&quot; stinky 
    vagina TV commercials), but the film as a whole is a bitter 
    disappointment. Bobcat gave it a go with &quot;found footage&quot; 
    and crapped out. Everyone has at least one bad film in them, so I 
    will forgive him for this 90 minutes of nothing; <B><A HREF="possession_of_michael_king_2013.htm">THE
     POSSESSION OF MICHAEL KING</A></B> (2013) is the same old &quot;found
     footage&quot; crap. Filmmaker Michael King (Shane Johnson, the best 
    thing about this film), who is a devout Athiest, decides to make a 
    documentary debunking the existence of God and the Devil after his 
    wife dies getting bad information from a psychic. He gets a little 
    more than he bargained for when he reads and performs ancient rituals 
    and actually does become possessed by a demon. Besides a couple of 
    good jump scares, the film is nothing but handheld and stationary 
    internet cameras showcasing Michael King becoming possessed. It ends 
    as all possession films do: incomplete, with no idea how to give a 
    film a proper finale. This is the freshman effort from 
    director/writer David Jung and it took over a year to find a 
    distributor (Anchor Bay), who gave it the same old &quot;limited 
    theatrical release&quot; in August 2014 along with a simultaneous VOD 
    release. It was then dumped quickly on DVD and pay cable. After 
    watching it, you'll know why; <B><A HREF="nightlight_2013.htm">NIGHTLIGHT</A></B> 
    (2013). It still surprises me that it takes two people to direct 
    &quot;found footage&quot; crap like this. Five friends go into the 
    woods to play a nighttime game of Hide &amp; Seek called 
    &quot;Nightlight&quot; and then all sorts of strange things begin to 
    happen and you can't wait until each and every one of these pathetic 
    teenagers die. The fact that five teenagers would play the game in 
    the section of the forest where there have been teen suicides shows 
    stupidity, not just on the teenagers, but also on the screenwriters 
    (who are also the directors, who shall remain nameless, because I 
    don't want to give them any free publicity). I'm sure those who enjoy 
    &quot;found footage&quot; films (really, it's pathetic, since half 
    the shots are of someone's feet), will enjoy drivel like this, but I 
    like my cameras to be held by professional cinematographers and 
    stories that don't depend on jump scares, but real scares. As long as 
    people keep supporting drivel like this, they will continue to be 
    made. And most horror fans lose in the process. Remember: Don't go 
    into the church (Uh-oh, upside-down crosses!)! The cameras will swirl 
    just so you can't see anything because the directors have nothing to 
    show (Or cameras falling and then bodies falling in front of them.). 
    Here's the story in one sentence. Five teens are scared their 
    batteries are going to run out on their flashlights while lights from 
    somewhere else chase them, catch them and drag them away. It tackles 
    the subject of teenage suicide irresposibly and without tact. Like I 
    said, pathetic. Made in 2013, but not released until 2015. That 
    should tell you something right there. Being released theatrically 
    and on disc by Lionsgate should also tell you more. Avoid.;<A NAME="WrathOfTheCrows2013"></A> <B><A HREF="wrath_of_the_crows_2013.htm">WRATH
     OF THE CROWS</A></B> (2013) is an Italian horror flick directed by 
    Ivan Zuccon, who is better known for directing low-budget films based 
    on H.P. Lovecraft stories, such as <B><A HREF="shunned_house_2003.htm">THE
     SHUNNED HOUSE</A></B> (2003), <B><A HREF="colour_from_the_dark_2008.htm">COLOUR

     WEST: RE-ANIMATOR</A></B> (2018). This film is a heavy-handed, 
    albeit very bloody, allegory about some of the scummiest people who 
    ever lived losing their souls in a mysterious dark and dank prison, 
    as they are &quot;judged&quot; by a mysterious person called &quot;The
     Judge&quot; who we never see. Their judgement could go one of three 
    ways, based on the color of a handkerchief that is tied to the bars 
    of their cells. A white handkerchief means Freedom, in exchange for a 
    sacrifice (such as a finger, hand or entire arm!). Red means death, 
    but you can bring the prisoner of your choice to the grave with you. 
    Black is the rarest color. It means you will rot in the prison for 
    all eternity and no one has ever escaped from here. The film opens 
    with prisoner Skinny (John Game), a.k.a. &quot;Sharp Teeth&quot;, 
    finding a white handkerchief tied to his bars. He is dragged from his 
    cell by evil head guard &quot;The Officer&quot; (Michael Segal; <B><A HREF="zombie_massacre_2_reich_of_the_dead_2015.htm">ZOMBIE

    head in a tub of cold water until he nearly drowns (A flashback shows 
    us Skinny's crime. He kept his pregnant girlfriend chained to the 
    kitchen floor and beat her up until she aborted her baby. He then 
    bites off a huge chunk of flesh off her face and eats it!). The 
    Officer then tells Skinny he is free to go, telling him to run very 
    fast, which he does. The Officer then lets loose his &quot;Dog 
    Soldier&quot; (Giuseppe Gobbato), a feral man who growls like a dog 
    (he usually wears a metal device in his mouth that stops him from 
    biting people), to catch Skinny, which he does, biting off pieces of 
    Skinny's flesh until The Officer pulls him off Skinny. He tells

    (The prisoners have no memory of how or why they were put in this 
    prison). It is obvious from the first time we see her that she is 
    there to make the other prisoners lives extremely difficult. Those 
    prisoners include Liza (Tara Cardinal; director/star of <B><A HREF="legend_of_the_red_reaper_2013.htm">LEGEND

    - 2013), the &quot;Guardian Of Lost Souls&quot;, a blind man that 
    Princess works for (As a young girl during the Middle Ages, Princess 
    refused to talk because she was telepathic and telekinetic, so her 
    mother turned her daughter in to The Inquisition, where she was 
    branded a witch, had her tongue ripped out, was beaten to death and 
    was then burned, but Charlie &quot;saved&quot; her from an eternity 
    in Hell and had her travel the Earth looking for the worst killers, 
    so he could collect their &quot;black souls&quot;.), but he sees 
    better than any person with 20/20 vision (Is Charlie God?). While 
    this film has some great cinematography and some very graphic 
    killings, it basically leaves the viewer feeling flat, because you 
    will guess what is going on the first time Princess makes an 
    appearance. It is obvious that this &quot;prison&quot; is imaginary, 
    a place much like Limbo, a region on the border between Heaven and 
    Hell (sometimes referred to as &quot;Purgatory&quot;), where the 
    worst of the worst are judged for their crimes and punished for them 
    by losing their souls. The way that one of them escapes this 
    judgement is quite touching, but it will still leave you feeling 
    &quot;meh&quot;. During the closing credits, we see a new group of 
    prisoners brought to the prison and it starts all over again; one 
    vicious circle of suffering, proving that God is, indeed, cruel. 
    Though very well acted by everyone (Why Shepis is not offered roles 
    in major Hollywood productions is still beyond me because she is a 
    revelation here), the story is something we have all seen before and 
    done much better. Ivan Zuccon has a lot of talent, but he needs 
    better scripts if he is ever to break out of the rut he is putting 
    himself in. While not awful, this film will not impress you. It

    than what is found in a hobo's pocket. This one dares to say

    telling the audience that the police collected this footage from 
    phones and security cameras, edited it together and released it to 
    the public, in hopes someone could come up with an explanation for 
    the deaths. Was it murder/suicide or is there another explanation?

    Family, father Michael (Ted Jonas), mother Janette (Julia Cearley), 
    teenage daughter Dana (Cat Alter) and teenage son Brandon (Drew 
    Hellenthal), move from Chicago to Tennessee into a house built on the 
    Bell Family property. The film then details their first two weeks in 
    the house, as they slowly become possessed by the Bell Witch (Marissa 
    Lynne Johnson), all of Brandon and Dana's new friends die 
    mysteriously and the same cop, Officer Bungalon (Jason Kakebeen), 
    discovers the dead bodies on several occasions (He seems to be the 
    only cop on the entire police force!). Since we discover during the 
    beginning that the footage was compiled by the police, we already 
    know that no Sawyer Family member survives this ordeal, so why should 
    we watch this mess? For the violence? No, the violence here is rather 
    restrained, as the audience only sees the aftermath of the deaths 
    when they are discovered by Officer Bungalon. The effects are poorly 
    done, just splashes of fake blood on the victims and one of Brandon's 
    new male friends is discovered in the woods with his intestines 
    pulled out of his body. For the nudity? No, there isn't any. For the 
    acting? What acting? People just scream at each other or act like no 
    family I have ever seen (When all the deaths are happening, Michael 
    won't let his family leave the cursed house, saying it's all he could 
    afford, knowing full well it will mean the death of his entire 
    family. This happens just after the Bell Witch, possessing Dana's 
    body, kills a priest performing an exorcism in the house!). For the 
    special effects? I've seen better effects at a grade school play! So 
    let's talk about how sloppy this film really is: Mother Janette's 
    name keeps changing in the script from Janette to Martha. Marthanette 
    tells Officer Bungalon they they have been living in the house for 90 
    days, even though the film is supposed to chronicle the first two 
    weeks they were there. Immediately after, she tells the priest that 
    they have been living there a little over a week! When the film 
    opens, the entire Sawyer Family are celebrating Brandon's birthday 
    outside at a pool party on January 15, 2011 wearing shorts and 
    bathing suits! Apparently Winter in Tennessee is just like that in 
    Nothern California (where this film was shot)! And what are palm 
    trees doing in Tennessee? Brandon's birthday gift is a very expensive 
    video camera (yet Michael complains that he is broke), a model that 
    wasn't released to the public until the middle of 2012! When the 
    blanket on Dana's bed begins to rise in the air by itself, we can 
    clearly see the wires holding it up! And Brandon, who is a budding 
    wannabe film student, always has his expensive camera in his hands to 
    record everything. As a matter of fact, everyone seems to have 
    cameras (Dana acts like a YouTube &quot;influencer&quot; with her 
    iPhone), as when the film isn't showing static security camera 
    footage from inside and outside the house, nearly everyone&nbsp; 
    (including dear old Dad) seem to be holding a camera in their hands, 
    filming away when they should be helping. Ridiculous. Films like this 
    are why The Asylum is considered one of the, if not THE, worst film 
    production companies in the world. They offer zero entertainment 
    value in their movies, they are all shot on the cheap and just drag 
    on. I honestly cannot understand why they are still in business. This 
    piece of crap gives even Found Footage films a bad name. And we all 
    know how I feel about that genre. I'd rather have my pubic hairs 
    pulled out one at a time with rusty tweezers and then have my crotch 
    soaked in lemon juice than watch this stinky slice of excrement or 
    any Asylum film again. And so should you! There are no opening or 
    closing credits to this film, only to protect the guilty. I will tell 
    you that it was directed by Glenn R. Miller, just so you can avoid

    are many POVs on how they see). The female alien dies because of our 
    atmosphere (it is very hard for them to adapt to it, so they are put 
    in special tents) and the female scientist in charge says that about 
    a hundred years ago, a meteorite crashed into the Soviet Union and 
    there was genetic material inside, They haven't been able to do 
    anything with it until science progressed, but the dead female seems 
    to have been the intelligent one, while the male is of below average 
    intelligence. Seems to be. Turns out that the head merc was stabbed 
    in the back (not literally), because the rest of the mercs were 
    promosed 2 million pounds each to bring him back alive, when his 
    mission was to bring them back dead. He gets the upper hand, though, 
    when the male alien turns out to be quite intelligent and has 
    developed a way to breathe in our atmosphere and created a weapon 
    that blows human heads off or make bodies totally explode (the alien 
    uses it on the female scientist to blow her head off). He escapes 
    into the world and the last time we see him, he is heading for the 
    British Parliament (This is a Great Britain production). While there 
    are plenty of pretty good gore-soaked scenes, they really come too 
    late in the film and what happens to the head merc really makes no 
    sense. Interesting, but it's a matter of too little too late. Too bad;<A NAME="Antisocial2013"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Have you ever wondered what would happen if a computer virus spread 
    to the human body? Well, this happens in a film called <B><A HREF="antisocial_2013.htm">ANTISOCIAL</A></B> 
    (2013). This could have been a really involving film, as it has a lot 
    to say about this generation's almost crazed and obsessive 
    involvement with sites like Twitter and Facebook, but some really bad 
    acting and a budget too low to pull off the film's lofty ambitions 
    reduces the film's bullet points, making it seem like a Computer Age 
    version of <B><A HREF="night_of_the_living_dead_1968.htm">NIGHT OF 
    THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> (1968) and not a very good one at that. The 
    film begins with two female friends live blogging on a Facebook-like 
    site called Redroom. One of the girls gets a phone call leaves the 
    room and then re-enters and tries to kill her friend. The friend 
    wins, but the trouble is just starting, as she, too, soon becomes a 
    victim to <I>something</I>. The film then switches over to college 
    student Sam (Michelle Mylett; <B><A HREF="complex_lockdown_2020.htm">THE
     COMPLEX: LOCKDOWN</A></B> - 2020; the best thing about this film), 
    who is jilted by her longtime boyfriend, not in person, but over 
    Redroom, telling her he thinks they should see other people. Sam 
    doesn't take this too well since most of the college students know 
    that her boyfriend was bonking another girl long before she knew of 
    it, thanks to Redroom (Just like Facebook at the time, everyone seems 
    to be connected to Redroom). Sam decides to drown her sorrow by 
    attending a New Years Eve party with her college friends, Mark (Cody 
    Thompson), Jed (Adam Christie), Chad (Ry Barrett), Steve (Romaine 
    Waite) and his girlfriend Kaitlin (Ana Alic), who have gathered at 
    Mark's shared house with his male friends. Trouble starts when the TV 
    News starts reporting on violent attacks happening in the city, which 
    then spreads all over the world. No one knows why this is happening, 
    but it seems people are turning violent and murderous, killing anyone 
    they come in contact with. Suddenly, one of Mark's friends knocks on 
    the front door and asks to be let in, but Jed tells Mark not to let 
    him in because he may be infected with what<A HREF="antisocial_2013.htm"><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/antisocial 2013 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    everyone outside seems to be catching (The news reports are telling 
    people to stay in their homes and not to let anyone inside). Steve 
    and Kaitlin are oblivious to all this, as thery are upstairs in a 
    bedroom about to get it on. Then Mark's place is surrounded by 
    screaming infected people, looking to break in by any means possible. 
    One guy breaks into the glass door on a terrace leading to the 
    bedroom that Steve and Kaitlin are in, forcing Steve to throw the man 
    off the terrace, killing him. Steve and Kaitlin are then informed 
    what is going on, but Steve gets a phone call from an unknown number 
    that plays an unusual sound. The TV News tells viewers that people 
    who are infected have the three following symptoms: 1.) They start 
    to&nbsp; hallucinate (thanks to the unknown phone caller), seeing 
    bloody and icky things that aren't there. 2.) They shorty after begin 
    to bleed from their nose, eyes and their ears and turn extremely 
    violent a short time afterward. 3.) Their brains swell until it 
    explodes out of their head, killing them. We then learn from a 
    whistle-blowing Redroom computer programmer on Sam's computer that he 
    created a program to make people who use their social network want to 
    use it more, but the program became self-aware, created a virus and 
    began infecting everyone who uses Redroom. Sam is also in contact 
    with that female friend at the beginning of the film who had to kill 
    her best friend, to see haw this virus affects humans. Sam watches as 
    the girl begins hallucinating, bleeding from her facial orifices and 
    dies when her brain explodes. Sam must try to survive anyway possible 
    as her friends becomes infected one-by-one and try to kill her. When 
    it is down to just her and Mark being alive and they learn on the 
    computer that there is a surgical procedure to make sure you don't 
    get infected (it involves drilling a hole in your forehead and 
    pulling out a black, worm-like vein before it attaches itself to your 
    brain. Sam wants Mark (who is a medical student in college and has 
    loved Sam for years) to perform the procedure on her, using an 
    electric drill in the toolbox (!), but when Mark begins hallucinating 
    while performing the procedure and Sam kills him with an axe, Sam is 
    forced to use the drill on her own forehead (which is very hard to 
    watch) and pulls out the black, worm-like vein. Sam then runs outside 
    with the axe, but she should have watched the blog with the girl 
    whose head exploded. It turns out none of the people who 
    &quot;died&quot; are actually dead at all; they now belong to a new 
    race of humans who share the same thoughts and desires or, in other 
    words, live in a hive mind-like state, like ants and bees, only the 
    computer program tells them what to do. The film ends with Sam 
    standing outside, as all the dead bodies littering the street behind 
    her come to life and slowly approach her. Turns out to see what 
    happens next, you'll have to watch the sequel, <B><A HREF="antisocial_2_2015.htm">ANTISOCIAL
     2</A></B> (2015), which I won't be watching. This film, 
    directed/produced/co-written by Cody Calahan (who also handled the 
    same chores with the sequel), contains some awfully bad acting 
    (especially from Adam Christie as Jed), which distracts you from the 
    story. The special makup effects, while bloody and gory, are not very 
    well done and also distract you from the film, but the biggest 
    problem with this film are the choices some of these people make, 
    especially Sam, who knows that Mark is infected, yet she talks him 
    into operating on her with an electric drill. When she puts the drill 
    to her own forehead and drills a hole in it, you'll either turn the 
    film off in disgust or decide to see if she gave herself a lobotomy, 
    but when the film ends suddenly with no payoff, you'll want to kick 
    your TV screen in. This is the primary reason why I have absolutely 
    no interest in the sequel. Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice...;<A NAME="AlienHunger2013"></A>&nbsp;
     &nbsp;&nbsp;<B><A HREF="alien_hunger_2013.htm">ALIEN HUNGER</A></B> 
    (2013) is a joke-filled sci-fi actioner starring Richard Hatch and 
    Vernon Wells, which references everything from <B><A HREF="battlestar_galatica_tv_series_1978-1979.htm">BATTLESTAR
     GALACTICA</A></B>'s (1978 - 1979) Captain Apollo (which Richard 
    Hatch portrayed in the original series) to <B><A HREF="road_warrior_1982.htm">THE
     ROAD WARRIOR</A></B> (1982; which is the film that made Vernon Wells 
    a star). It is these constant joke-filled pieces of dialogue that 
    does the film in because we can plainly see that both Hatch and Wells 
    are ad-libbing much of the time and they aren't very good at it. The 
    film deals with two aliens that land in the mountains of California, 
    where a deadly fire is raging and threatens to swallow up Forest 
    Ranger Mike Gibson's (Hatch) Ranger station, where he lives with 
    daughter Cassie (Lisa Cullen). Mike lost his wife and Cassie's mother 
    due to an automobile accident a year ago and even though Cassie is of 
    driving age, she refuses to get behind the wheel of a car (I think we 
    can see where this is heading).&nbsp;The aliens have come to Earth to 
    feed on the body of campers they find in the forest, including a 
    biker gang led by Big Frank (R.A. Mihailoff; <B><A HREF="leatherface_the_texas_chainsaw_massacre_3_1990.htm">LEATHERFACE:

     He picks it up, looks at it and says, &quot;What is this?&quot; 
    Funny, huh?). When the two aliens find their way to the Ranger 
    Station, Mike has to put the survivors of the attack in his his 
    station, including Mike's cousin Jenny (Serah Henesey), local Sheriff 
    Thom Baker (Wells), Cassie's new boyfriend/motocross rider Jim Connor 
    (Tyler Stoner), bitchy girl (what would a horror film be without 
    one?) Mary (Marlene Mc'Cohen) and Brian (Kurt Yaeger), who was bitten 
    on his lower left leg by one of the aliens and it has to be amputated 
    immediately (Don't they all?). Since the alien's spaceship, a green 
    pod-like vehicle (The film was shot as <B>THE POD</B>) has disabled 
    all means of communication, be it telephone, cellphone, police radio 
    or two tin cans and a string, and the fire is rapidly approaching the 
    station, our motley group must find a way to destroy the pod so they 
    can call for help. In the meantime, Jenny, who is an ER nurse, 
    amputates Brian's leg with a tree branch saw (!), but when his leg 
    starts growing back (!), everyone realizes that killing the aliens 
    will not be an easy task (lots of talk about starfish and the 
    Discovery Channel). During the finale, everyone, except the Sheriff 
    and Brian, escape (After Mike and the Sheriff destroy the pod. Or do 
    they?) and we see Brian has turned into an alien (complete with a 
    snake-like CGI tongue) and is protecting a bunch of alien eggs in the 
    station. WHAT THE FUCK?!? Director/producer/screenwriter Edward 
    Conna, who also co-directed Vernon Wells in the awful <B><A HREF="dead_undead_2010.htm">THE
     DEAD UNDEAD</A></B> (2010), has no idea how a sci-fi film should 
    work, even though he tries to spice the film up with some topless 
    nudity, bits of bloody gore and some pretty good car stunts (Conna is 
    a stuntman by trade), but it's the jokey dialogue that undoes the 
    film. Vernon Wells doesn't know when to shut up, tossing 
    &quot;funny&quot; asides (at least he thinks so) at Richard Hatch, 
    who also tries his best to ad-lib some funny quips from his past 
    acting assignments. The thing is it doesn't work and the 
    non-conclusive finale (which tosses aside all logic) doesn't help 
    matters since a sequel never happened. Of course the IMDb gets the 
    date wrong on this film, listing it as a 2017 production, when the 
    blooper reel-filled final credits sequence plainly states that it was 
    a 2013 production. It should also be noted that Richard Hatch passed 
    away in 2017. It's best if you just let this film pass you by (It's 
    available free streaming on YouTube on channel &quot;Horror 
    Central&quot;) and remember Richard Hatch during better times.;&nbsp; <B><A HREF="silent_retreat_2013.htm">SILENT
     RETREAT</A></B> (2013/2014)<A NAME="Bad2014"></A> is one of those 
    horror films that doesn't make very much sense. It is about a 
    troubled girl named Janey (Chelsea Jenish), who lost her parents in a 
    car crash and begins acting out. A judge sentences her to spend 6 
    months (for something that wasn't her fault) in a Rehabilitation 
    Retreat in the middle of the woods where silence is demanded or the 
    weird head of the facility, Dr. Prince (Robert Nolan), and his 
    equally weird sons, will punish them. Dr. Prince has a bunch of rules 
    the all-female patients have to follow: No talking (silence is a 
    must), no cell phones, no obscene hand gestures, no eye contact with 
    any of the male staff and no more than five girls can congregate at 
    the same time. Why the silence? At the beginning of the film, we see 
    one of the female patients in the woods who broke the rules twice 
    (that is all that Dr. Prince will allow) being attacked by some type 
    of creature that stalks the woods (I'll tell you about the confusion 
    this film causes in a minute). It turns out that Dr. Prince is 
    actually brainwashing the girls to be the perfect obedient wifes (the 
    same judge sentenced them all there) by use of drugs and themes used 
    in <B><A HREF="clockwork_orange_1971.htm">A CLOCKWORK ORANGE</A></B> 
    (1971) and some of them who think that they have been at the retreat 
    for several months have actually been there for a few years. This is 
    a non-robotic version of <B><A HREF="stepford_wives_1975.htm">THE 
    STEPFORD WIVES</A></B> (1975), with a creature thrown into the mix. 
    Janey gets involved in the conspiracy and Dr. Prince sentences her 
    and her new friend Alexis (Sofia Banzhaf) to spend a night in the 
    woods for breaking into his office and looking at the patient 
    records. They manage to escape the creature by the skin of their 
    teeth, but the creature shows up at the compound for the first time 
    (?) and kills Dr. Prince, his sons, the male staff, Alexis and all 
    the girls except Janey. The creature turns out to be female (a pretty 
    bad makeup job, showing the film's paltry budget; five people played 
    the creature in the film!) who is nursing a baby on one of her 
    breasts and was once a normal girl at the Rehabilitation Retreat 
    until Dr. Prince left her in the middle of the woods for not 
    following his orders (The baby may be his.), but Janey yells at the 
    top of her lungs and scares the creature away. The final shot is of 
    Janey walking away from the retreat. Now for the confusion part: Why 
    does everyone have to be silent when the creature is deathly afraid 
    of loud noises? It makes no sense. Director/producer Tricia Lee (<B><A HREF="blood_hunters_2016.htm">BLOOD
     HUNTERS</A></B> - 2016) and screenwriter Corey Brown (<B><A HREF="clean_break_2013.htm">CLEAN
     BREAK</A></B> - 2013, also directed by Tricia Lee) seem to be making 
    it up as they go along, as very few scenes make any sense at all. 
    Besides the attack at the beginning of the film, we have to wait over 
    and hour for the creature to attack again and when it does, it is 
    unimpressive because you can hardly see anything (For once, I would 
    like to see a creature attack people on a nice sunny day instead of 
    the dark night!). Sometimes I have to watch these losers so you don't 
    have to waste your time. Do yourself a favor. If you see this film 
    playing on TV (Chiller shows it a lot) or see a used DVD for a low 
    price, pass them both by. Here's another piece of confusion: Even 
    though this film was shown at film festivals in 2013, the end credits 
    list it as a 2014 production. There was probably some post-production 
    work done on the film before it was released on U.S. DVD in 2015, but 
    I doubt any tinkering will make it a better film.; <B><A HREF="android_cop_2013.htm">ANDROID
     COP</A></B> (2014) is another lousy The Asylum mockbuster, this one 
    an awful copy of FOX's failed 2013 - 2014 TV series <B><A HREF="almost_human_tv_series_2013.htm">ALMOST
     HUMAN</A></B> (although, according to the IMDb, it is a remake of <B><A HREF="robocop_1987.htm">ROBOCOP</A></B> 
    - 1987!). The problem was, The Asylum didn't know that the series 
    would be a flop. The story is about a cop (Michael Jai White) in the 
    future who gets an android (Randy Wayne) as a partner and they don't 
    get along. They are out to rescue the Mayor's (Charles S. Dutton) 
    daughter (Larissa Vereza), but the Mayor and a bunch of rogue cops 
    don't want her to come out of this alive. Even a surprise 3/4 of the 
    way through the film fails to improve it. Full of the usual lousy 
    Asylum CGI, bad shoot-outs, the familiar destroyed industrial park 
    representing our future (the location has been used in many of The 
    Asylum's productions; <B><A HREF="death_racers_2008.htm">DEATH RACERS</A></B> 
    [2008], starring The Insane Clown Posse, being one of them), martial 
    arts; the usually great White is given very little to do when it come 
    to his martial arts prowess. I guess both the series and the film 
    deserve each other. And Kadeem Hardison overacts to the point that 
    the film becomes parody. Maybe he can get acting lessons from Bill 
    Cosby in prison. Director/screenwriter Mark Adkins (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HalloweenNight2006">HALLOWEEN
     NIGHT</A></B> - 2006) has yet to learn how to make an enjoyable 
    film. Most of his films are an endurance test to watch and this one 
    is no different. Skip it; <B><A HREF="exists_2013.htm">EXISTS</A></B> 
    (2014) is another &quot;found footage&quot; film from director 
    Eduardo S&aacute;nchez, one of the co-directors of the 
    &quot;original&quot; found footage film (a point I find highly 
    contentious) <B><A HREF="blair_witch_project_1999.htm">THE BLAIR 
    WITCH PROJECT</A></B> (1999). This piece of crap (complete with shaky 
    cam syndrome, unlikeable characters; cell phones that don't work 
    where they are, 50% of the film shot in pure darkness and sickly 
    green nightvision) is about a bunch of people hoping to catch some 
    footage of Bigfoot simply because one of their Uncles claims he saw a 
    Bigfoot there. All they get is footage of a dark &quot;something&quot;
     walking across the screen while people say, &quot;Hello Mr. 
    Sasquatch? I just want to be friends.&quot; Really? Like they know 
    Bigfoot understands English? Like 99% of all found footage films, 
    nothing ever comes from the expedition except the minimal of evidence 
    which would not hold up in a court of law run by retards and deaths 
    of those involved in the expedition (The closest we get to see a real 
    Bigfoot is the attack scene at an abandoned trailer, which kills 
    everybody except one, as the angry Bigfoot pushes the trailer down an 
    embankment). Then we finally get good video footage of the Bigfoot 
    (for about 20 seconds), who is angry because the idiots killed its 
    baby (by hitting it with their car in the beginning of the film), but 
    lets the last guy live because he has lost all his loved ones, too, 
    but we still have to put up with 80 minutes of found footage tropes 
    to get to it. All everyone does in this film is argue, which gives 
    the viewer a headache (not to mention nausea from watching the 
    always-moving cameras). Here's my biggest question: If you were being 
    chased by a Bigfoot while riding a bike equipped with a camera, why 
    can't you use your helmet cam or cell phone camera to get good 
    footage of the Bigfoot except for quick worthless glimpses? Friends 
    like this nobody needs. What they need is a professional 
    videographer, someone who knows how to act in these situations, but 
    no found footage films usually have them. The ones that do are 
    usually better than shit like this. The biggest problem with this 
    film is that one of the idiots survives (and drops his camera; 
    leaving behind evidence that Bigfoot exists and clearing him of his 
    friends' deaths). Stupid, stupid, ending; <B><A HREF="calling_2014.htm">THE
     CALLING</A></B> (2014) should have been a bang-up thriller about a 
    serial killer (Christopher Heyerdahl) who commits a series of 
    religious murders in a sleepy little Canadian town run by an 
    alcoholic chief of police (Susan Sarandon), who once tried to commit 
    suicide, but it moves at such a snail's pace, it induces yawns rather 
    than thrills. Seems like the serial killer, who goes by the name 
    Simon, is committing a series of 12 religious murders to try and 
    bring his brother back, who committed suicide (see the connection?). 
    The only life this film holds is Topher Grace as&nbsp; gay cop Ben 
    Wingate, recently hired by the town (because the other police force 
    he worked at relentlessly made fun of his sexual preference) and his 
    refusal to give up looking for Simon, even though he was told by the 
    FBI to back off.&nbsp; His discovery of how Simon would hold the 
    tongues of his victims (for over an hour) until rigor sets in (and

    their killings that spells out a religious saying in Latin) in is the 
    only original piece in the film. Even Donald Sutherland, Ellen

    Margaret Hollyman) proposal of marriage and gets bitten by a vampire 
    after having a few disasterous blind dates (with the females 
    complaining about his 5 1/2&quot; dick). Filled with some of the 
    worst dialogue you would hear this side of the NYC D Train, this film 
    is a talky, slow-moving flick (only enlivened by Fred Vogel's

    looking for any real action here, don't bother, as the camera focuses 
    on Turkel's bearded face nearly 90% of the time, while we have to 
    listen to the hipster garbage that comes out of his mouth. This is a

    (using the initials &quot;RP&quot;), co-wrote, co-produced and stars 
    as washed-up actor Reagan Pearce (&quot;RP&quot;. Get it?) who is 
    straight out of rehab and travels to Louisiana to do a B-Film to get 
    his career jump-started (He meets the film's know-nothing director 
    and chunky producer, who wants them all to go to dinner that night 
    and score some whores). He is then kidnapped by rednecks Mike (Ian 
    Barford) and Junior (Stephen Louis Grush, who gives the film a layer 
    of emotion the film doesn't deserve) and chained-up in a shack in the 
    swamplands of the Louisiana bayou. Mike accuses Reagan of cheating 
    with his wife (which is true, but Reagan was too high to remember) 
    and tortures Reagan by breaking his right hand, punching the snot out 
    of him and using a cattle prod to deliver painful electric shocks 
    (Mike almost cuts off Reagan's balls with bolt cutters until Junior 
    intervenes). It seems that even rednecks are aware of the power of 
    the Internet, because Mike and Junior hijack Reagan's Twitter account 
    and post racist rants, making it look like Reagan is back on drugs 
    again and hiding somewhere to do them (We see TMZ-like reports on TV 
    about Reagan's supposed antics). While Mike goes to work as a 
    security guard, Junior is in charge of keeping an eye on Reagan and 
    saves him from the jaws of a crocodile, treats him with some respect 
    and then almost sodomizes him until Reagan is saved by a phone call 
    by Mike, giving Reagan a chance to kill Junior with the chains on his 
    wrists (and also giving Phillippe a chance to show off his bare ass). 
    When Mike makes it back to the shack, Reagan kills him, too, and the 
    story puts him back on the A-List again, which anyone with half a 
    brain could see coming as soon as Reagan was kidnapped. The only good 
    thing about the film is Stephen Louis Grush's acting and the WTF?!? 
    YouTube video that plays over the end credits (you'll have to take my 
    word for it, unless you are into watching painful films). Otherwise 
    the film is nothing but a drawn-out boring piece of self-indulgent 
    trash that can't make up its mind what kind of film it wants to be. 
    Is it horror? Is it comedy? Is it drama? Is it a romantic love story? 
    Just call it a turd and be done with it. It went straight to VOD in 
    October 2014.</FONT></FONT></P>

     DTV Genre Films Part 14 (continued): <B><A HREF="remaining_2014.htm">THE
     REMAINING</A></B> (2014) starts out pretty interesting (it is a 
    mixture of &quot;found footage&quot; and normal filmmaking 
    techniques), as we witness a wedding taking place (hence the found 
    footage from the video cameras recording the wedding) in the room of 
    a large hotel. And then it hits you over the head with it's true 
    meaning. As soon as the bride Skylar's (Alexa Vega) mother said she 
    wished the wedding was held in a church rather than a hotel, people 
    start dropping dead left and right for no apparent reason at all. 
    Yes, it's Rapture time and besides some great special effects (planes 
    falling out of the sky, buildings crumbling under the trembling of 
    the Earth's surface), we start getting preached to how as a race, we 
    are despicable people (Skylar even says, &quot;I'm religious. I go to 
    Church every Sunday. Why didn't God pick me?&quot;, like that is what 
    makes someone religious) and the people left alive are portrayed in 
    the &quot;every person for themselves&quot; mode. Skylar goes to a 
    library with her new husband and some friends to find a Bible 
    (wouldn't going to the local church be more convenient, which they 
    eventually do after hitting the library? WTF?!?) to find out what 
    they can expect next. Yes, there are plague of locusts, Gabriel 
    blowing his horn and other Biblical prophecies that come true, but 
    some people refuse to believe this is the Rapture and would rather 
    believe this is an alien invasion! One disbeliever actually goes 
    outside and dares God to take him and before you can say 
    &quot;Religious Right&quot;, a huge tentacle (supposedly sent by God) 
    appears out of the sky, impales the guy and sucks him up out of the 
    Earth's atmosphere. This PG-13 Rated film (which got a simultaneous 
    one week theatrical/VOD release before quickly hitting disc and pay 
    cable) hits you so hard over the head with its religious views 
    (director Casey La Scala's last directorial effort was the 2003 
    skateboarding film <B><A HREF="grind_2003.htm">GRIND</A></B>), that 
    you will have to rush yourself to the Emergency Ward of your local 
    hospital with a gaping scalp wound. I'm not against religious films 
    (quite the opposite; as an Atheist, I find a lot of them quite 
    enjoyable), but this movie portrayed the ones that were left behind 
    as petty, self-absorbed people, something I could never agree with. 
    There are touches <A HREF="as_above_so_below_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/as above so below poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>of
     H.P. Lovecraft in the film (one of the film's small saving graces) 
    and some above-average special effects, but the abrupt ending and the 
    whole storyline will leave you cold, something I'm sure God (if he 
    exists) would not want you to feel. It's not a badly-made film, but 
    its sledgehammer approach in delivering its message is a real 
    turn-off; <B><A HREF="as_above_so_below_2014.htm">AS ABOVE SO BELOW</A></B> 
    (2014) is another headache-inducing &quot;found footage&quot; film 
    about an archaelogist named Scarlett (Perdita Weeks) who is obsessed 
    in finding &quot;The Philospher's Stone&quot;, which can turn any 
    substance into gold and give the person who owns it eternal life (her 
    father committed suicide in pursuit of it years ago and left her a 
    journal describing his trials and trevails). She sneaks into Iran to 
    find the &quot;Rosetta Stone&quot; to translate the grave marker of 
    the man who purportedly created the gold-making stone in Paris, 
    France. She discovers the code key to the translation (after too much 
    shakey-camera work for one person to to endure) and heads back to 
    Paris, where the reverse side of the grave marker points her in the 
    direction of a secret underground tunnel 371 feet below Paris (which 
    is littered with over 200 miles of underground catacombs and 
    skeletons, which were actually used in the production of this film, 
    the first film production to get permission from French 
    officials&nbsp; to do so). She talks her friend George (Ben Feldman) 
    into going with her, along with three tour guides, Benji (Edwin 
    Hodge), Papillon (Fran&ccedil;ois Civil) and Souxie (Marion Lambert) 
    to help in her search. The rest of the film is an underlit, 
    shakey-cam experience, where, when anything bloody or scary happens, 
    we get a micro-second glimpse of it before the camera starts shaking 
    again. And just what are a piano, a car and a ringing telephone doing 
    371 feet below Paris? Director/co-writer John Erick Dowdle also made 
    the lousy <B><A HREF="quarantine_2008.htm">QUARANTINE</A></B>&nbsp; 
    (2008) remake (another found footage film), as well as the above-average
     horror film <B><A HREF="devil_2010.htm">DEVIL</A></B> (2010), about 
    a bunch of people trapped in an elevator where one of them could be 
    old Scratch himself, but this film is a test of patience even for 
    fans of found footage films. It is nothing but endless bickering and 
    the occasional jump scare, but by the end of the film you won't care 
    whether Scarlett finds the Philospher's Stone (and yes, she does find 
    it, but has to give it back) because she treats the rest of her crew 
    like disposable human beings, always putting their lives in danger 
    (even leading them to the Gates of Hell!), until it is too late for 
    two of her group. The title does have a meaning that is described in 
    the final sequence of the film (Which way is up when you are in 
    Hell?), but it's a long 90 minutes to get to it. Why bother? It's 
    also one of those films that had a limited theater/VOD release before 
    being dumped on disc and pay cable;<A NAME="DeathSquad2014"></A> <B><A HREF="death_squad_2014.htm">DEATH
     SQUAD</A></B> (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="2047_sights_of_death_2014.htm">2047:
     SIGHTS OF DEATH</A></B> - 2014) could be quite possibly the worst 
    action film I have ever laid eyes on. Director Alessandro Capone (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#WitchStory1989">WITCH
     STORY</A></B> - 1989) invited a bunch of soon-to-be-has-been actors, 
    including Danny Glover (I see a lot of DTV films in his future; he 
    looks to have shot all his scenes in one day while sitting in a hotel 
    room), Rutger Hauer (who already has plenty of DTV films under his 
    belt), Daryl Hannah (who is quickly becoming the DTV queen), Michael 
    Madsen (enough said) and Stephen Baldwin (ditto) to come to Italy and 
    make one of the most mind-numbing action films I have ever laid eyes 
    upon. It seems that Capone forgot that it takes action to make an 
    action film. Supposedly, it takes place in the future, but Capone's 
    idea of the future is to have plenty of foggy camerawork to cover-up 
    the fact that there is nothing futuristic on view and everyone just 
    talks, talks, talks, talks about sex and a vaccine for a deadly 
    disease, shoots a little and then talks, talks, talks, talks about 
    sex again and a vaccine for a deadly disease. Madsen looks like he is 
    zonked out of his mind (he must have scored some good blow in Italy), 
    Glover looks as if his career has ended (He's now doing a PSA on TV 
    for a disease no one ever heard of before, PBA [Pseudobulbar affect], 
    where people cry and laugh uncontroably and he leads you to a website 
    where your browser is locked from leaving it. I have PBA, too, being 
    a member of the Professional Bowlers Association. Oh, shut up you 
    politically correct retards, it's just a joke!) and Baldwin always 
    has that look on his face that someone just let loose a stinky fart. 
    Believe me, a stinky fart is 1,000 times more interesting than this 
    piece of shit. Luckily, I saw this on Showtime, so I didn't have to 
    pay for the turd-like DVD. I pity anyone who did or paid money to 
    watch it streaming;&nbsp; <B><A HREF="ouija_2014.htm">OUIJA</A></B> 
    (2014) seems like it should be a found footage film, but it's not. 
    It's probably the worst horror film of 2014 and that year was full of 
    lousy horror films. A bunch of friends try to contact a dead girl to 
    see if she actually comitted suicide, only to unleash a blood-thirsty 
    demon (well for a PG-13 film, anyway) of a girl who has her mouth 
    sewn shut and used to live in the house years before. One of the 
    girls does some research and discovers that the ghostly demon 
    actually has a sister that is still alive (played by Lin Shaye, the 
    best thing about this mess). Instead of questioning why this lady is 
    in a mental institution, the stupid girl actually follows her 
    instructions to remove the sutures from her dead sister's mouth. All 
    this does is cause more death and destruction and every teen in this 
    cast deserves their fates (It's one of those movies where someone 
    gets dragged across the floor into the darkness by an unseen force, a 
    trope that is used in way too many cheaply-made horror films to try 
    to elicit a scare. All it does is make me yawn.). This is Stiles 
    White's first stab at directing, so I'll give him a little slack, 
    since he also wrote the screenplays for <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Boogeyman 2004">BOOGEYMAN</A></B> 
    (2004), the vastly underrated <B><A HREF="knowing_2009.htm">KNOWING</A></B> 
    (2009) and <B><A HREF="possession_2012.htm">THE POSSESSION</A></B> 
    (2012; Well, two out of three ain't bad!). It's still a stupid movie 
    with teens doing stupid things (Like playing with an ouija board to 
    begin with. Haven't they watched any horror films? And if you are 
    going to burn an ouija board, destroy the planchette, too! They are a set,<A HREF="cabining_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cabining poster12 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    you dolts!). This is not junk food for the mind, it is garbage for 
    the dump. I don't know one single person who liked this film. 
    Somehow, this film made over $102 million across the world on a $5 
    million production budget, which means we will see a sequel in 2016. 
    (BAD NEWS: The sequel, <B><A HREF="ouija_origin_of_evil_2016.htm">OUIJA:
     ORIGIN OF EVIL</A></B>, opened October 16, 2016) I pity anyone who 
    goes to see it. Actually I don't pity them more than feel sorry for 
    them, especially if they paid money for a ticket for the first film 
    and do the same for the second; I really, really wanted to like <B><A HREF="cabining_2014.htm">THE
     CABINING</A></B> (2014), since it turns all those <B><A HREF="evil_dead_1983.htm">EVIL
     DEAD</A></B>-like &quot;lost in a cabin in the woods&quot; flicks on 
    their heads, but it just ended up being too ordinary for my tastes. 
    Others may feel different, though. The cabin in this film is actually 
    &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, an artists retreat by the ocean where 
    &quot;artists&quot; of all kind can have peace and quiet to get 
    &quot;inspired&quot;. Two screenwriters, Todd (played by the 
    director's brother Mike Kopera, who is quite good) and Bruce (Bo 
    Keister, also funny), hoping to finish a horror script for their boss 
    or get fired are the two main protragonists and they are pretty 
    hilarious team. Unfortunately, their stay there is anything but 
    soothing. Todd hooks up with a female &quot;real writer&quot; of 
    novels and Bruce gets involved with a French-sounding painter, which 
    takes their mind off their work. As the days count down until they 
    are supposed to finish their screenplay, &quot;accidents&quot; begin 
    to happen, like a female guest slipping on a banana peel and impaling 
    her head on a piece of driftwood or another getting beheaded in a car 
    accident. All of these scenarios come from the worst cop, Detective 
    Berwyn (Chuck Saale), on record, who believes nothing is wrong with 
    the retreat and people should just get back to normal (One 
    &quot;accident&quot; may be forgiven, but two &quot;accidents&quot; 
    is more than a coincidence). His stupidity gets himself killed by a 
    beartrap, though. Todd gets the brilliant idea of using the events 
    that are happening at the retreat as the basis for his screenplay and 
    he bangs it out on his notebook computer in one night. In a cheat to 
    the audience, we actually see his screenplay playing out on screen 
    when we think it is something really happening. Of course, after all 
    the bloodshed is done, we are back to Todd at the notebook as the 
    people we just saw die complain about how they were killed in the 
    screenplay. The screenplay actually brings out the real killer and he 
    is knocked out and taken away by the police. In what turns out to be 
    a nice twist at the end, all four of the main people in the film live 
    happy lives and there is no &quot;surprise ending&quot; where evil 
    wins, unless you are talking about some funny bloopers during the 
    final credits. Like I said, I really wanted to like this one, but it 
    really doesn't pick up stream until the final 15 minutes, but the 
    acting is generally above average, so some may have a good time with 
    this. I believe if director Steve Kopera lets someone else write the 
    screenplay for his next film (he also edited this one) and he 
    concentrates on directing, he may have a winner on his hands. Just 
    because this film is in the &quot;Bad&quot; category, doesn't mean 
    that it is awful. Actually it is quite entertaining, but it could 
    have been so much more. Most of the positive reviews written for this 
    on IMDb seem to be written by crew members or friends of the crew and 
    actors, so take what you read there with a grain of salt. Another 
    reviewer gave it one star, which probably means he never saw the film 
    or has a grudge against someone who worked on the film. Like I said, 
    this is neither awful or a classic. It is fun in its way, though. 
    Just not fun enough for me to give it a positive review; <B><A HREF="culling_2014.htm">THE
     CULLING</A></B> (2014) starts out interesting enough when five young 
    adults (four of them stoners [one just out of rehab!] and one of them 
    the &quot;good girl&quot;) are driving to the SXSW music festival and 
    stop at a diner to get something to eat, only to find it was just 
    closing (First mistake: Diners are open 24/7, at least where I live). 
    They meet a creepy little girl in the parking lot and feel it is 
    their duty to take her home. Once they get to her house, they find it 
    empty (the girl somehow has the power to make her crayon drawings 
    come true), but the parents soon return (Johnathon Schaech is the 
    father) and say that their daughter was supposed to be with her 
    grandfather. They invite the quintet to stay for dinner and get drunk 
    and stoned enough that they agree to spend the night when the mother 
    &quot;accidentally&quot; cuts her leg with an axe and the little girl 
    doesn't want to go to the hospital with them (Second mistake: What 
    about the music festival?). It's so obvious that these kids are being 
    set-up, you would have to be brain dead not to know it. Then it 
    becomes the same old, same old, as some type of monster (first seen 
    as badly CGI-rendered fast traveling black smoke) begins picking them 
    off one-by-one. The explanation is ridiculous and the final look at 
    the monster that possesses the father's body is so bad, it's 
    laughable. It contains the same old horror clich&eacute;s, such as 
    the truck not starting for the &quot;good girl&quot; (of course, all 
    the others are killed because they drink and smoke pot) until the 
    posssessed get close to it, the house not having a phone, their cell 
    phones are in a dead zone and ends with a crayon drawing from the 
    little girl (who is hiding in <A HREF="vice_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/vice 2014 poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="217" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>the
     back of the pickup truck) of the good girl going through the truck's 
    window. It's not particularly a good film, except the acting talents 
    of Chris Coy (TV's <B><A HREF="banshee_tv_series_2013.htm">BANSHEE</A></B> 
    [2013 - 2016]), who does give the film some &quot;pop&quot; every now 
    and then. Director/writer Rustam Branaman (<B><A HREF="project_solitude_buried_alive_2009.htm">PROJECT
     SOLITUDE: BURIED ALIVE</A></B> - 2009) starts out good at the gate, 
    but come up last in the race. And why does an Unrated film feel the 
    need to silence out all the swear words? Not worth your time; <B><A HREF="vice_2014.htm">VICE</A></B> 
    (2014) is derivative of so many science fiction movies and TV shows

     DOWN</A></B> - 2012) would even bother to make it (Then again, I 
    have yet to see a Miller film that I like). It takes place in a 
    future society where Bruce Willis runs a company that can make all 
    your dreams come true, whether legal or illegal, by using 
    &quot;artificials&quot;, human-like robots with real skin and some 
    real human organs that are cursed to have their memories erased every 
    day and repeat the same scenario every night. Of course, something 
    goes worng, err... wrong (Thanks <B><A HREF="westworld_1973.htm">WESTWORLD</A></B> 
    - 1973) and a female artificial named Kelly (Ambyr Childers) escapes 
    the facility and goes to search for the truth of her origins. Turns 
    out she was made in the exact image of Evan's (Bryan Greenberg) dead 
    wife so he could visit her every night in a virtual bar (it always 
    ends up with Kelly and her girlfriend being killed in the parking lot 
    at the bar Kelly bartends at by someone who pays Willis' company to 
    feel what it is like to kill a person). This film is strictly 
    by-the-numbers, from Thomas Jane's wooden match-chewing old-fashioned 
    cop, Johnathon Schaech as the evil head of the security force out to 
    kill Kelly on Willis' command, to a very disinterested-looking Willis 
    playing the villain (he already did a movie in the similar vein with <B><A HREF="surrogates_2009.htm">SURROGATES</A></B> 
    - 2009). It could have been a much better movie by comparing how 
    virtual murder could lead to real-life murder, but that concept is 
    given a throw-away line and forgotten. This is nothing but a 
    futuristic shoot'em-up and not a particulatly good one. This had one 
    of those limited theatrical/VOD releases before being dumped on disc 
    and pay cable. Don't waste your money. If you must watch it, watch it 
    on one of the pay cable stations (I saw in on CineMax). And you 
    thought the remake of <B><A HREF="total_recall_2012.htm">TOTAL RECALL</A></B> 
    (2012) was bad. It looks like a piece of solid gold when compared to 
    this stinking steaming pile of dog crap; <B><A HREF="pyramid_2014.htm">THE
     PYRAMID</A></B> (2014) I had some high hopes for because I'm a 
    sucker for archaeological dig films and I think Denis O'Hare is one 
    of the best character actors out there. But once I discovered it was 
    a &quot;found footage&quot; flick, most of my hopes went out the 
    window. The premise is pretty good: An archaeology team led by O'Hare 
    and his daughter (Ashley Hinshaw) find a three-sided pyramid buried 
    beneath the sand in Eqypt (Just for the record: There are no such 
    things as three-sided pyramids). They send a robot equipped with 
    cameras to check its shafts, but something destroys it and they are 
    ordered by the U.S government to leave the country immediately (it 
    seems for some reason the streets of Cairo are full of violent 
    protests), but they go to retrieve the very expensive robot (it 
    belongs to NASA) only to get lost in the myriad of tunnels inside the 
    pyramid. It seems that the pyramid is actually a prison, meant to 
    keep something in, and it isn't the small little CGI sphinx-like 
    creatures roaming the passageways and biting people. The team runs 
    into booby-traps (one woman falls into a pit filled with sharp wooden 
    spikes and she is not only impaled, but being chewed on by the little 
    critters) and then we find out who the real villain is: Anubis; a 
    half-man, half-jackal creature (really bad CGI) who eats the heart of 
    it's victims (when O'Hare became its first victim, I lost all 
    interest in the film). If you like watching 50% darkness and 
    sickly-green nightvision camera shots, you may like this film more 
    than I did (but I still pity you), but even the most stout found 
    footage supporters would say that the ending not only sucks, it reeks 
    of desperation, as the screenwriters (who shall remain nameless), 
    obviously wrote themselves in a corner and couldn't figure out a way 
    to write themselves out of it. There is some gore to be had, but the 
    camera pulls away just as it gets interesting. It amazes me that 
    people will hold on to video cameras while they are being killed, but 
    pull the camera away when they see the first sign of blood (except 
    for one guy who has the fortitude to film Anubis eating O'Hare's 
    heart, but it is still in that awful green nightvision mode which 
    takes most of the detail out of the picture). This was another film 
    produced by Alexandre Aja, which proves he's a better director than 
    producer. This is Gr&eacute;gory Levasseur's first film as a director 
    and I had high hopes for it since he co-wrote (with Aja) the very 
    interesting screenplay for the <B><A HREF="maniac_2012.htm">MANIAC</A></B> 
    (2012) remake, but I guess he should stick with screenwriting. It's 
    amazing that a major company like 20th Century Fox would pick this up 
    for distribution, but it only ended up getting the token limited

    post-apocalypse film where, a few years from now, in Oregon (actually 
    shot in the Mojave Desert in California), it hasn't rained in years 
    (no reason is given for it not raining across the planet). Living on 
    the remains of an orphanage are Kendal (Haley Lu Richardson) and Dean 
    (Booboo Stewart), who is slowly dying from kidney disease. For the 
    first hour of the film, it's all about Kendal looking for a 
    distributor cap for a small plane she plans on using to fly Dean to a 
    safe zone where he can get proper medical attention, all the while 
    trying to avoid the uber-religious Carson clan, headed by Pa Carson 
    (Jon Gries, the only reason to watch this film), who believes 
    whomever owns the water owns the land and kills without conscience to 
    claim those rights. Kendal sees many people shot to death, some being 
    friends from nearby farms, as she tries to protect young boy Alby 
    (Max Charles), who hides in a nearby barn, but he doesn't want her 
    protection. He thinks she's a bad luck charm. After about an hour of 
    Kendal pulling distributor caps off of all types of old abandoned 
    vehicles that are useless on the plane, she is captured by the Carson 
    clan and is nearly killed until Dean shows up and sacrifices his 
    life. Then things get interesting, as Kendal shotguns people in the 
    head, groin, legs and chest and uses a samurai sword to cut people to 
    pieces in retribution for Dean's killing and Alby's kidnapping. It 
    leads to a final showdown and, for once, there's a happy ending, but 
    you'll have to put up with long stretches of nothingness thanks to 
    director/co-screenwriter Tom Hammock (his first film as a director). 
    Lots of bloody blood squibs and some good blade effects do not a good 
    film make. Look for cameos by Barbara Crampton, Michael Massee and a 
    blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo by Adam Wingard (the director of <B><A HREF="youre_next_2011.htm">YOU'RE
     NEXT</A></B> - 2011; also co-editor of this film) as a compound 
    soldier. Co-screenwriter Jacob Forman was the 
    producer/co-screenwriter of the disappointing <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#AllBoysMandy2006">ALL
     THE BOYS LOVE MANDY LANE</A></B> (2006), on which Hammock was a 
    Production Designer and an uncredited actor; <B><A HREF="da_sweet_blood_of_jesus_2014.htm">DA
     SWEET BLOOD OF JESUS</A></B><A NAME="DaSweetBlood"></A> (2014) is 
    director Spike Lee's remake of Bill Gunn's <B><A HREF="ganja_and_hess_1973.htm">GANJA
     &amp; HESS</A></B> (1973) which was funded by Kickstarter and took 
    just 16 days to shoot (Having normal people fund a millionaire's 
    films insults me). Besides continuing to call his films &quot;A Spike 
    Lee Joint&quot; (this one is called &quot;An Official Spike Lee 
    Joint&quot;) and opening his films in unusual manners (this one shows 
    the opening credits while a street dancer performs), he gives the 
    late Bill Gunn co-credit for the screenplay (many bits of dialogue 
    are taken verbatim from the original film), but somehow Spike Lee 
    turns a serious film into a semi-comedy, which puts a stain on the 
    original. Dr. Hess Greene (Stephen Tyrone Williams) is stabbed by a 
    mentally disturbed Lafayette Hightower (Elvis Nolasco) with an 
    ancient sacrimonial African dagger Dr. Green just acquired (Hightower 
    commits suicide after brushing his teeth while taking a bath!) and he 
    becomes addicted to drinking blood. He's not a vampire; he can walk 
    in the daylight and do everything else a normal person can do, but he 
    needs blood to stay alive, First he robs a blood bank and then he 
    kills a prostitute and drinks her blood, but then Hightower's wife 
    Ganja (Zaraah Abrahams) pays Hess a visit and he immediately tells 
    her that her husband committed suicide. She doesn't seem to care very 
    much and becomes Hess' lover, while Hess tries to find more people to 
    feed his habit (he turns Ganja into someone like him because he 
    doesn't want to be alone). The acting in this film is very flat and 
    poor, like everyone is in some kind of hypnotic trance and the film 
    is overlong at a little over two hours (another Spike Lee trait). The 
    only interesting thing about this film (besides some extreme 
    bloodletting, but it's nothing you haven't seen before) is to see 
    Rami Malek as &quot;Seneschal Higginbottom&quot;, Dr. Green's butler 
    who Ganja seems to take pleasure in torturing emotionally. Malek 
    filmed this right before he made the first season of <B><A HREF="mr_robot_tv_series_2015.htm">MR.
     ROBOT</A></B> (2015) and he's the best thing about this film (he 
    even gives his death scene an emotional core missing from the rest of 
    the film). But two hours of talk, talk, talk, doesn't make for a good 
    film and it's apparent that this was a vanity project that Lee wanted 
    to make (just like <B><A HREF="oldboy_2013.htm">OLDBOY</A></B> [2013] 
    remake, which I think is very underrated, especially in Lee's 140 
    minute version. The studio's 105 minute cut is an abomination [Which 
    is why he called it &quot;A Spike Lee Film&quot; rather than &quot;A 
    Spike Lee Joint&quot;].), but he didn't want to spend his own money 
    on it. Some scenes go on for much longer than they<A HREF="backcountry_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/backcountry poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    should (the church scene being one of them) and some of the music 
    used on the soundtrack seems like gospel songs, contrasting the 
    story. What better way to pull in sucke....investors than to have 
    them fund it for him?: It was filmed so fast because three cameras 
    were rolling at the same time, which gave Lee all the coverage he 
    needed for each sequence of the film. Still, it's a complete borefest 
    when compared to the importance of the original film. Some people may 
    like it, but I found it to be a filmic endurance test. Spike Lee has 
    been turning more cold than hot lately (except for his excellent 
    documentaries, which is what he excels at better than normal 
    filmmaking, except for <B><A HREF="do_the_right_thing_1989.htm">DO 
    THE RIGHT THING</A></B> [1989], which I think is the best film ever 
    made on race relations), which is why his past few films went through 
    the limited theatrical/VOD release (including this one). He even 
    seems to make full-frontal female &amp; male nudity and a little bit 
    of lesbianism boring here. This film is populated by people we just 
    don't give a damn about, so what's the point?; <B><A HREF="backcountry_2014.htm">BACKCOUNTRY</A></B> 
    (2014) contains no monsters, killer hillbillies or mutant cannibals. 
    All it has is a couple, Jenn (Missy Peregrym) and Alex (Jeff Roop; 
    also an Executive Producer), taking a camping and canoeing trip into 
    the woods and eventually running into a very hungry black bear. 
    Eventually is the key word here. We have to go through all the 
    couple's squabbles, a visit from a hiker named Brad (Eric Balfour in 
    an extended cameo doing one of the worst Irish accents on screen), 
    who Alex believes is hitting on Jenn, and Alex eventually confessing 
    to Jenn that he brought her to the woods to propose marriage to her 
    (he shows her the ring). After about an hour of that nonsense the 
    bear shows up to terrorize and kill one of them. The only really good 
    thing I can say about this film is that when the bear is chasing Jenn 
    through the woods, you can see that there is actually a real black 
    bear chasing her. No CGI or crap like that. But you'll have to get 
    through a bunch of other crap to get to that scene. The only other 
    actor in the whole film is a cameo by an unrecognizable Nicholas 
    Campbell as the Ranger who rents them the canoe. This is the first 
    feature-length film from director/writer Adam MacDonald, who is 
    better known as an actor (the superior <B><A HREF="wolves_2013.htm">WOLVES</A></B> 
    - 2013). He has to learn that if he is going to set a film in the 
    woods, we need more than people arguing incessantly. That's all this 
    film basically is (with only a couple of gore scenes and they are 
    nothing to write home about); <B><A HREF="capsule_2014.htm">CAPSULE</A></B> 
    (2014) is basically a one-man film for 90% of its running time. In 
    1959, during the height of the Cold War, the British send Guy Taylor 
    (Edmund Kingsley) in a rocket as part of Project Hermes, making him 
    the first man in space. His capsule is hit by an American rocket (one 
    that contained a chimpanzee as the passenger) and his oxygen starts 
    depleteling slowly. During this time, he is getting instructions on 
    coming home from British Ground Control, but communications are 
    interrupted by Russians and the United States authorities wanting to 
    know what his mission is in outer space (is this all a product of 
    oxygen deprivation?). It won't take a rocket scientist to figure out 
    what is going on (especially if you are into anagrams, in which a 
    doozy of one can be found in the beginning of the film) and the 
    ending comes a no surprise at all, especially if you pay attention to 
    the photo of Guy's wife when it burns. But this is mostly talk and is 
    nothing but a low-budget version of <B><A HREF="gravity_2013.htm">GRAVITY</A></B> 
    (2013) for most of its running time. The only ones who will be 
    surprised by the ending are those who haven't paid full attention to 
    the film. Directed and written by Andrew Martin, his first 
    full-length feature film. Let's hope his next film has a little more 
    meat on the bone.; <B><A HREF="garm_wars_the_last_druid_2014.htm">GARM
     WARS: THE LAST DRUID</A></B> (2014) is a supreme case of style over 
    substance. If it's lush landscape photography, beautiful Celtic music 
    (sung by Mongolian singers!) and metaphysical dialogue you want, you 
    may like this future fantasy film (Or does it take place in the past? 
    It's so confusing, you can't tell). It is basically a three-character 
    story (well, four if you count the non-talking Druid, who turns out 
    to be a nasty tentacled child) and this has to be one of Lance 
    Henriksen's biggest roles in a very long time, but this 
    Canadian-financed film, directed and written by non-English speaking 
    and highly respected Mamoru Oshii (the anime <B><A HREF="ghost_in_the_shell_1_1995_and_2_2004.htm">GHOST
     IN THE SHELL</A></B> - 1995; who needed no less than 5 translators 
    to tell the cast what to say), lost something in the translation (And 
    why are the Japanese so obsessed with tentacles?) and what we end up 
    with is a film that is pretty to look at but makes absolutely no 
    sense. It also feels unfinished, which hurt any chance of this 
    playing in U.S. theaters (It did play in theaters in other countries, 
    though). Maybe Oshii meant to make this a multi-part film, but the 
    low returns financially seem to have thrown that idea out the window. 
    It's also Rated PG-13, which means the violence is kept in that 
    arena. Lance, Kevin Durand (the abusive ghost policeman in <B><A HREF="echo_2008.htm">THE
     ECHO</A></B> - 2008, and has appeared in his share of multi-part 
    superhero and YA movies) and M&eacute;lanie St-Pierre are good as 
    people from different warring races who band together to find God 
    knows what, but it ends wide open for a sequel where Henriksen and 
    Durand will not return (Hint: They died). Don't hold your breath 
    waiting for it. Oh, and there's a basset hound in it, too (an Oshii 
    trademark), named Gula (played by Holly the dog), who is treated like 
    some sort of God. All the damn thing wants is to be petted, but these 
    mental midgets (who don't know what a dog is) can't understand that. 
    Some good giant creatures at the finale, which are a mixture of 
    physical and CGI effects, but you will be so confused, your brain 
    will be mush long before you get to that part. I don't advocate drug 
    use, but in this case, it may save your life; <B><A HREF="curse_of_downers_grove_2014.htm">THE
     CURSE OF DOWNERS GROVE</A></B> (2014) got very little press, even 
    though the screenplay was co-written by Bret Easton Ellis (along with 
    director Derick Martini), whose novel was made into the film <B><A HREF="american_psycho_2000.htm">AMERICAN
     PSYCHO</A></B> (2000). Ellis also wrote the screenplay to <B><A HREF="smiley_face_killers_2020.htm">SMILEY
     FACE KILLERS</A></B> (2020), based on a true story of a serial 
    killer or killers who murder handsome college-age men, dump their 
    bodies in water and leave a hand-drawn smiley face near the bodies. 
    It's very easy to see why this film got very little attention. It is 
    nothing but a mess disguised as a horror film, but actually falls 
    into the thriller category. Legend has it in Downers Grove, Illinois, 
    that a senior will die every year before high school graduation. That 
    is where the legend stops in the film until the quick ending. Most of 
    the remainder of the film deals with high school senior Chrissie 
    (Bella Heathcote), who is nearly raped in a bathroom at a party by 
    high school football quaterback Chuck (Kevin Zegers), but she pokes 
    one of his eyes out and escapes. This ends the promising college and 
    professional football career of Chuck, who is verbally and physically 
    abused by his father Charlie (Tom Arnold, who is the best thing about 
    this film, even though he is in it for about 5 minutes). A 
    steroid-shooting Chuck and his posse decide to make Chrissie and her 
    friends lives miserable, beating some of them up and threatening 
    others, while the police do nothing because Chuck's family has pull 
    in the town. Chrissie becomes romantically involved with grease 
    monkey Bobby (Lucas Till), who also gets beaten up when a one-on-one 
    fight with Chuck turns into a one-on five fight with Chuck's posse. 
    Chrissie's brother David (Martin Spanjers) and her best friend Tracy 
    (Penelope Mitchell) decide to throw a party before graduation (much 
    to Chrissie's displeasure) and Chuck and his posse invade it, which 
    results in Chrissie grabbing a shotgun and killing all of Chuck's 
    friends and then smashing in Chuck's face with the butt of the 
    shotgun. Chrissie is then stabbed and killed by one of her best 
    friends since childhood simply because he has a crush on her and 
    hated seeing her with Bobby, making the curse come true. That is 
    basically the film in a nutshell, with stuff about Chrissie and 
    David's father abandoning them because he was an addict and a 
    head-scratching stinger after the closing credits adding up to very 
    little. This is nothing but a series of fights and ending with people 
    getting killed. I do not understand the point of this film and either 
    will you. And what the hell is an ancient Native American doing in 
    this film? Best left forgotten.</FONT></FONT></P>

    (2014), which is like a digital age <B><A HREF="halloween_1978.htm">HALLOWEEN</A></B> 
    (1978), but it just takes too long to get to the killings. Almost an 
    hour, as a matter of fact. The film opens in 1988 Alabama, where two 
    cruel pre-teen girls chase a fat boy and trick him into showing them 
    his penis. They laugh and the head girl blows him a kiss as he runs 
    away. The fat boy gets even with the head girl by sticking a tree 
    branch into the spokes of her moving bicycle and she falls face-first 
    onto a metal grate bridge, where the boy throws her bike over the 
    bridge and then <A HREF="girlhouse_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/girlhouse poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>kicks
     the bloody girl off the bridge, killing her. We are then in the 
    present, where college girl Kylie (Ali Cobrin), who has just lost her 
    father and needs to make money to stay in college, decides to be a 
    part of &quot;GirlHouse&quot;, a classy porn site where many girls 
    are asked to do any type of sexual act (but only if they want to) in 
    a house fitted with dozens of cameras, even in the bathrooms. The fat 
    kid, now grown and known online as &quot;Loverboy&quot; (portrayed by 
    the single-monikered Slaine, who is a cross between the late Nicholas 
    Worth and the still living Pruitt Taylor Vince and is a man of few 
    words), is a paying member of GirlHouse and takes an instant liking 
    to Kylie (who ends her sessions with Loverboy by blowing him a kiss), 
    even sending her his photo, which is strictly forbidden (his lair is 
    full of photos with his and Kylie's face pasted together like 
    lovers), but Loverboy is a computer programmer and expert hacker (Pay 
    close attention to the scene where he is working at an office fixing 
    their computer network, looking up a female employee's skirt and 
    getting caught doing it). When he sees his photo pinned to the 
    GirlHouse bulletin board insulting his looks (it was not put there by 
    Kylie, but a recently returned girl hooked on heroin), he hacks the 
    house's address and heads there wearing a rubber girl mask and 
    carrying a toolbox. By that time nearly an hour has passed, as Kylie 
    hooks up with old childhood friend Ben (Adam DiMarco), who knows what 
    she is doing and we get to know the houseful of girls. When the 
    killing starts, it is bloody and gory (and sometimes downright 
    surreal, as one girl has a dildo shoved down her throat and then has 
    her hands taped over her mouth!). One vain girl gets her fingers 
    chopped off with a hatchet and her face cut up with a boxcutter. 
    Loverboy leaves her alive, but she manages to put a plastic bag over 
    her head and suffocates herself because she can't stand the thought 
    of living this way. Other members get their heads sawed off, are 
    hammered to death, are impaled with spikes, are almost roasted in a 
    sauna room (the girl escapes, but is killed when she jumps in the 
    pool to cool off) and have their heads crushed by a door slamming 
    over and over on it. Only Kylie is left alive (now remember, everyone 
    can watch this because it is streaming live) and Ben and his computer 
    major friend Alex (Wesley MacInnes, who has the best lines at the end 
    of the film) try to find the location of the house to save her. Kylie 
    manages to kill him on her own (finally using nightvision on a 
    digital camera to good effect), ending the menace, but is it really 
    the end? First-time directors Trevor Matthews and Jon Knautz, working 
    with a screenplay by Nick Gordon, manage to fill the film with plenty 
    of female nudity and some good gore, but forgot that today's 
    audiences don't want to wait an hour for the blood to flow. The film 
    is professionally acted, photographed and edited and I did enjoy what 
    it was trying to go for, but to wait 60 minutes of a 99 minute film 
    for the good stuff (besides the nudity and the extremely nice 
    millionaire owner of the house and website revealed to be gay!) is 
    asking a lot of audiences today, who don't want exposition and just 
    want the good gory stuff as soon as possible. A nice try that some 
    older slasher film fans (like myself) will enjoy, but next time, get 
    to the gore faster. Good music score by tomandandy enhance the kill 
    scenes. I can always tell when they are a film's musicians because 
    they have a sound like no one else.; <B><A HREF="unknown_caller_2014.htm">UNKNOWN
     CALLER</A></B> (2014) is a totally typical thriller in which there 
    are very few surprises. A divorced lobbyist (David Chisum) and his 
    young daughter (Emma Rayne Lyle) are trapped in his house when his 
    newly installed security system (He had it installed because he 
    sucessfully lobbied for a fracking bill to be approved. Right there, 
    I want him dead, too.) is hacked by a deranged man (He sits in front 
    of a dozen computer screens wearing a hoodie. Who the hell is going 
    to see him? Why, it's the audience, although revealing his face will 
    not tip off anyone who he is!) who tells him that no one can leave 
    the house, otherwise a bomb he planted will go off, killing everyone 
    in the house. People are allowed to enter the house, but not leave 
    it. All the deranged man wants to know is the answer to this 
    question: &quot;Who am I?&quot; It's not long before the lobbyist's 
    ex-wife (Louise Griffiths) and lover (Assaf Cohen) are also trapped 
    in the house and they begin to search the house for the person's 
    identity. The answer to that question is pretty rote (the deranged 
    man is an old high school student ignored by the lobbyist!) and the 
    ending is way too pat for anyone to keep their meals down (He and his 
    ex-wife get back together and she is pregnant. The lover is now their 
    best friend who now has a fiancee of his own. Oh, and he reversed his 
    decision about the Fracking Bill!). If you like seeing a cat getting 
    shot for trying to leave the house, then this is the film for you. 
    Directors/Screenwriters/Executive Producers &quot;The Olson 
    Brothers&quot; (actually Amariah and Obin Olson) offer nothing new to 
    the thriller genre besides using the Digital Age as a plot device and 
    you'll be shaking your head in disbelief when the reason for all this 
    fuss is revealed. Fracking is bad, but it looks like solar energy 
    when compared to this film. Avoid.; <B><A HREF="it_follows_2014.htm">IT
     FOLLOWS</A></B> (2014) is one of those rare birds that premiered in 
    limited theaters and VOD and proved so popular that the amount of 
    theatrical screens was substantially increased the next week. Don't 
    ask me why. Besides a couple of effective scenes, this is basically a 
    boring tale about teenage girl named Jay (Maika Monroe), who is raped 
    in the back seat of a car by someone she thought was a friend. He 
    tells her he has passed on a curse to her and she will be followed by 
    a shape-shifting demon only she can see, unless she has sex with 
    someone else and passes the curse on to them. The only backside to 
    that is that if the person she passes the curse on to dies before he 
    has sex with someone else, the demon will revert back to going after 
    her. Why? Damned if I know. The film fails to explain it and 
    first-time director/screenwriter David Robert Mitchell doesn't even 
    try to give us an inkling of why this is suddenly happening except 
    Jay's rapist telling Jay he met a woman in a bar who passed it on to 
    him. There are two good scenes, one at the beach and another one at 
    an indoor pool, where Jay and her friends try to fight the demon (who 
    takes human form, sometimes as a naked lady and sometimes as a naked 
    man) that only Jay can see and they lose both of the times. Jay has 
    sex with one of her male friends Greg (Daniel Zovatto) to get rid of 
    the demon, but it then takes form as Greg's mother, who kills him by 
    having sex with him! Jay then has sex with another one of her 
    childhood friends and the film ends with them walking hand-in-hand 
    down a sidewalk. Talk about a non-ending! Some critics have said that 
    this is the best horror films in ten years, but all I can say is that 
    these critics must not watch a lot of horror films. While the subject 
    matter is unusual (but not so unusual that the basic plot is a 
    reverse theme from <B><A HREF="cherry_falls_2000.htm">CHERRY FALLS</A></B> 
    - 2000), the film is full of plot holes big enough to pass a cruise 
    ship full of nudists through. The only good things about the film are 
    the sparse makeup effects of Robert Kurtzman and his crew and the 
    music soundtrack by Disasterpiece (actually a pseudonym for Rich 
    Vreeland). Don't believe the hype. This film barely passes muster.; <B><A HREF="cooties_2014.htm">COOTIES</A></B> 
    (2014) could have been a great film if it weren't for the weak 
    screenplay by actor/co-screenwriter Leigh Whannell (who wrote this 
    with co-star Ian Brennan, who plays the Vice Principal). Some people 
    may love it because of some funny one-liners and visual clues from 
    other films and TV shows, but the story is old hat. Even though this 
    show is about children, you will not want your kids watching it. The 
    story concerns some contaminated chicken patties that make it to 
    grade school lunch and soon the 1st Grade children are turning into 
    blood-thirsty, fast-moving zombies who only go after the adult 
    teachers, which includes Elijah Wood, Allison Pill, Rainn Wilson (the 
    film's saving grace), Jack McBrayer, the aforementioned Leigh Wannel 
    and a mushroon-high Jorge Garcia watching all the action from his 
    van. While there are a couple of situations that made me laugh 
    (Wilson calls Wood a Hobbit and know-it-all Whannell [but more than a 
    bit dyslexic] performing an autopsy on a child that had his head 
    smashed-in with a fire estinguisher, forgetting to wear gloves) and 
    some minor story alterations (Wood gets bitten, but Whannell 
    determines that adults who are infected just gets flu-like symptoms 
    with some minor &quot;anal leakage&quot; [again, doing the 
    examination without gloves]), most of the film is just the children 
    running after the adults and every once in a while picking one off 
    and tearing them apart, chewing on their decapitated limbs, until 
    Wilson has had enough and decides to turn the tables, with the 
    teachers killing as many kids as possible (a teacher's dream), while 
    trying to use Wilson's four-wheeler truck to escape. There is plenty 
    of bloody gore (What Wood does to one of the children with Wilson's 
    truck is one of the film's highlights), some played for comedy, but 
    this film is lacking in many respects and two directors, first-timers 
    Jonathan Milott &amp; Cary Murnion, fail to deliver a film with any 
    atmosphere (or tell us where the contamination came from besides<A HREF="angels_of_darkness_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/angels of darkness dvd front2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="214" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    showing us a filthy chicken farm, as an employee snaps the diseased 
    chicken's neck and puts it through the grinder) and an ending that is 
    rushed and not satisfying. As a matter of fact, it begs for a sequel, 
    one that I will not be in a hurry to watch. Besides some great actors 
    and some very bloody gore, this film fails to register as a good 
    comedy/horror film. Some may watch it for the actors alone, but only 
    Rainn Wilson registers. Made in 2014, but not released until 
    September of 2015 in a limited theatrical/VOD release. Did I fail to 
    tell you about the Oriental janitor who knows martial arts? Oh, my, 
    talk about stereotypes. There is a small, useless stinger after the 
    film's end credits that makes no sense.; <B><A HREF="angels_of_darkness_2014.htm">ANGELS

    called <B><A HREF="angels_of_darkness_2014.htm">THE CURSE OF STYRIA</A></B>,
     another film based on author Sheridan Le Fanu's novel 
    &quot;Carmilla&quot; and it is pretty slow, like pouring a glass of 
    honey in sub-zero weather. This time, noted restorer Dr. Hill 
    (Stephen Rea; <B><A HREF="fear_dot_com_2002.htm">FEARDOTCOM</A></B> - 
    2002) is sent to restore an ancient castle in Hungary (filmed on 
    location) and has to bring his troubled daughter Lara (Eleanor 
    Tomlinson) with him because she was just kicked out of another 
    school. Lara is a notorious &quot;cutter&quot; who uses a razor blade 
    or anything sharp to cut herself (the scars on her arms give her 
    away). One day Lara witnesses a car slamming into a tree that would 
    kill most people, but out walks Carmilla (Julia Pietrucha), hardly 
    the worse for wear. Lara and Carmilla become secret friends because 
    Lara's father doesn't trust anyone around his daughter. Lara and her 
    father make a discovery in the castle that proves an old vampire 
    addage not very known today. We only think vampires have existed for 
    a little over 200 years and follow Bram Stoker's view on them. But it 
    was quite different when Carmilla was a vampire. Dr. Hill and Lara 
    finds a bunch of perfectly preserved female corpses and legend has it 
    the castle they are restoring was used as a place for people with 
    consumption, or tuberculosis as we call it now. When people were ill 
    with this, it was thought they were being drained by a 
    &quot;vampire&quot; though that term was never used until much later 
    in history. Dr. Hill digs up the bodies, examines them, then cuts off 
    the heads and burns the bodies. It was thought that if the body 
    looked fresh, it was enough proof they were a vampire, just like it 
    was shown here when fresh blood came out of one the girls' mouth. 
    More stuff happens, but the film basically makes no sense, especially 
    the finale. Once again, it takes two freshmen feature directors, 
    Mauricio Chernovetzky and Mark Devendorf, to make a film so boring, 
    it will introduce yawns after the first 10 minutes. Maybe one day we 
    will get the Carmilla story made right on film, but this film 
    definitely isn't it. It even put the fly that was buzzing around me 
    to sleep. I couldn't kill it because I felt the same way. I would 
    have to kill it the next day. When a film is so slow and boring that 
    you feel sorry for a fly, you know you are watching something you 
    wish you weren't.; <B><A HREF="tekken_2_kazuyas_revenge_2014.htm">TEKKEN

    Pickaxe is back, but she can't convince anyone, especially Sheriff 
    Mathews, who thinks it is nothing but the ravings of a drunk who was 
    once locked-up in a loony bin. We then switch to a bunch of cliched 
    horny teens, who are going to the &quot;world's best music 
    concert&quot;, located in the middle of Pickaxe's territory. That's 
    basically the entire film in a nutshell, as Pickaxe begins killing 
    the teens one-by-one until he invades the music concert and kills all 
    twenty people attending the concert (for the &quot;world's best music 
    concert&quot;, it has the most anemic audience in concert history!), 
    as well as the band members themselves (Have you ever heard of the 
    &quot;Sacrilegious Desecration Band&quot;? Me neither.) and then 
    turning his attention to Adrienne. And just like all of the <B><A HREF="#HatchetII2010">HATCHET</A></B> <A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HatchetIII2013">films</A>,
     this one, too, has a &quot;sudden&quot; ending, setting us up for a 
    sequel, which, thank God, never happened. While the killings are 
    gory, they are nothing to write home about, especially on this film's 
    paltry $1.99 budget (or at least it looks like it). 
    Director/producer/writer Jeremy Sumrall (an Associate producer on <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Sweatshop2010">SWEATSHOP</A></B> 
    - 2010), who hasn't made another feature film since this one, fails 
    to elicit good performances out of anyone, as A. Michael Baldwin and 
    Tiffany Shepis seem to know what a loser of a film this is and don't 
    even try. This threadbare horror comedy flick fails to elicit one 
    laugh and even the late Ted V. Mikels or Ed Wood Jr. couldn't make a 
    good film (or a bad one) with the lower-than-low no-budget Sumrall 
    had here, which is why it took five years to find a distributor (<A HREF="http://www.wildeyereleasing.com">Wild
     Eye Releasing</A>, who else?). The editing on this film is 
    particularly horrible, but I'm willing to guess that the poor editor 
    (John Gordon Hale), didn't have a lot of footage to work with, as the 
    film seems unfinished and lacked the Second Unit footage needed to 
    segue between scenes. All this film does is make the viewer pity 
    everyone who appears in this insufferable flick, especially all the 
    young women who bared their breasts in hope of getting 
    &quot;noticed&quot; (thankfully, Tiffany Shepis didn't stoop so low). 
    I wonder if they drooped after five years? Do yourself a favor and do 
    something else, like scraping your corneas with sandpaper. It's less 
    painful than watching this pitiful excuse for a film. Film on my

     DOOR</A></B> (2015). This film, which features many of the same 
    actors, is not as awful as that one, as the story is very 
    interesting, but it eventually collapses under it's own 
    ultra-religious weight. The film opens with Jonathan Black (a good 
    Obba Babatund&eacute;; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Necronomicon">NECRONOMICON:
     BOOK OF THE DEAD</A></B> - 1993) driving fast to his mother's house, 
    as she's on the phone with him saying she is dying. He is not paying 
    attention to the road and sideswipes a car, sending it ito a ditch. 
    Jonathan wakes up with a small boy with blood on him staring at him, 
    not saying a word. Jonathan checks on the car in the ditch, and 
    discovers a mother in the driver's seat slowly dying, asking him for 
    help for her and her daughter, who is trapped in the back seat. 
    Jonathan then remembers about his mother and leaves the scene of the 
    accident, but he does make an anonymous 911 call to the police at a 
    phone booth. Jonathan and his mother end up at the same hospital as 
    the mother and daughter, who are dead, but her small son is still 
    staring at Jonathan, not saying a word. We then find out Jonathan's 
    mother is a hypocondriac and she makes these same &quot;life and 
    death&quot; calls to her son on a regular basis. In other words, 
    Jonathan shouldn't have left the scene of the accident, because he 
    should have known better. Fifteen years pass and Jonathan is a 
    teacher of Religious Studies at a college, but he is still haunted by 
    the accident and what he did. His guilty conscience won't allow him 
    to forget. Jonathan is also a very tough teacher, who puts down his 
    students for being &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;unintelligent&quot;, 
    but they still seem to love him for his gruffness. When one of his 
    students is viciously murdered, two <A HREF="if_i_tell_you_i_have_to_kill_you_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/if i tell you i have to kill you poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>cops,
     Detective Harris (Keith David; <B><A HREF="they_live_1988.htm">THEY LIVE</A></B> 
    - 1988) and Detective Wilkes (Robert Miano; <B><A HREF="hollywood_vice_squad_1986.htm">HOLLYWOOD
     VICE SQUAD</A></B> - 1986), pay Jonathan a visit and they find his 
    demeanor suspicious, if not for the murders, then for something else. 
    They hound Jonathan nearly every day, but he manages to keep his 
    cool, especially when his teaching assistant/student, Max (Michael 
    Bernardi), defends him to the two detectives. There is one very 
    strange student in Jonathan's class, Michael (Reiley McClendon), who 
    seems to know more than he is saying, but when students ask him to 
    tell them what he knows, he tells them, &quot;If I tell you... I will 
    have to kill you&quot; and then whispers in their ear. Most of them 
    end up dead a short time later. Michael also has a hulking nameless 
    friend (Tommy 'Tiny&quot; Lister; <B><A HREF="extreme_prejudice_1987.htm">EXTREME
     PREJUDICE</A></B> - 1987) who talks in a demonic voice, telling 
    Michael he is going too far, but Michael tells him he knows what he 
    is doing.. It seems everyone in this film are keeping secrets, 
    including Detective Wilkes, who doesn't want to work with his 
    partner, but Detective Harris is holding something over him that is 
    so horrible, it could kill him (or at least make Detective Wilkes 
    lose his job and go to prison). There's also a suicidal student named 
    Revel (Erika Barrett) who has the Suicide Hotline on speed dial and 
    Jonathan treats her like shit. More students end up dead and Jonathan 
    becomes the main suspect, but we know he can't be the killer. I know 
    what you are thinking: Michael is the small boy from fifteen years 
    ago. You would be wrong. The little boy is actually Max, who is 
    killing students to point the finger at Jonathan, so he can feel the 
    same pain as he did all those years growing up as an orphan. The 
    finale finds Max pointing a pistol at Jonathan and pulling the 
    trigger (after he runs Detective Wilkes through with a metal pole at 
    a graveyard). Michael appears just as Max pulls the trigger, the 
    bullet hitting Jonathan in the chest. When Max pulls the trigger 
    again, Michael shows his true self and his wings (!), deflect the 
    second bullet and it hits Max, who dies. That's right, Michael is an 
    angel and his hulking friend is actually the angel Gabriel! Why did 
    they come down to Earth? Beats me, but I'm sure the heavy-handed 
    religious overtones and symbolism have something to do with it. This 
    slow-moving religious horror flick does contain a couple of good 
    elements. One would be Obba Babatund&eacute;'s acting. He makes a 
    believable tortured soul, who lives by the sword and dies by the 
    sword. I was left wondering why Keith David and Robert Miano were 
    doing in a cheap film like this, but they, too, make their roles 
    believable, even though we never find out what Detective Wilkes was 
    guilty of. Everything else about the film has a cheap sheen to it, 
    including the acting from most of the cast and the story, which is 
    all over the place. Oh, and did I mention that Tom Sizemore has a 
    small role as Jonathan's idiot savant friend? (Sizemore nails the 
    role!) I didn't hate this film, but it really isn't a good piece of 
    cinema, either. It manages to entertain on a base level until the 
    final reveal, complete with CGI wings on both Michael and Gabriel, 
    which will either make you laugh or groan. I'll leave it up to you to decide.;<A NAME="UnionFurnace2014"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="union_furnace_2014.htm">UNION FURNACE</A></B> (2014) is

    (2012) and <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hostel">HOSTEL</A></B> (2005) 
    in that it revels in the degradation of people less fortunate, but 
    don't get me wrong, this is torture porn, plain and simple, a genre 
    I'm not very fond of. Down-on-his-luck Cody Roy McCloud 
    (producer/co-screenwriter Mike Dwyer), who owes a lot of money to a 
    loan shark for losing bets (on the ponies), steals a car out of a 
    church parking lot and drives to the local chop shop, only to be told 
    that the car is worth nothing on the car parts black market, so he 
    drives away empty handed, only to be followed closely by a truck, 
    which forces him to crash the car. Out of the truck comes 
    &quot;Lion&quot; (Seth Hammond), whom Cody mistakens for a cop, but 
    he's anything but. He befriends Cody, giving him<A HREF="union_furnace_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/union furnace poster12a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="139" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    money and telling him that he can be rich beyond his wildest dreams 
    for the rest of his life, if he will participate in a &quot;game&quot;
     that is played every year. Cody agrees and is blinded with a hood 
    over his head so he can't see where the game takes place, When the 
    hood is lifted, Cody sees that seven other people (who were also 
    wearing hoods) besides him are on a makeshift stage, each of them 
    assigned a number (Cody is #8). All of the contestants need money 
    badly and they are then brought to a room, where there are eight 
    boxes marked with corresponding numbers; each box containing $20,000 
    in cash. They are told that anyone who wins their game can keep the 
    money and those who lose will have their money evenly split with the 
    winners. What they don't know is that there can only be one winner. 
    The rest will die. The &quot;audience&quot; for the game is made up 
    of rich people wearing plastic animal masks and &quot;Lion&quot;, who 
    wears a lion mask, is the master of ceremonies of the game. What 
    follows next is some of the worst degradation put on screen, as the 
    women contestants are raped by the male contestants (there's even a 
    threesome rape), a retarded male contestant is made to shit his pants 
    and clean it up with his bare hands (nothing is left to the 
    imagination) and the only black contestant, only known as 
    &quot;#1&quot; (Keith David; <B><A HREF="thing_1982.htm">THE THING</A></B> 
    - 1982) has his head bashed in with a sledgehammer and one of the 
    female contestants is made to eat his exposed brains with a spoon! 
    About the only thing this film has that's worthwhile is a tremendous 
    surprise ending that will take you aback. Until then, 
    director/co-screenwriter Nicholas Bushman ladles on the degradation, 
    which leads up to the shitting of the pants, the brain eating and the 
    violent rape which are downright disgusting to watch, as members of 
    the game die when they lose their challenge. Lion tells Cody that he 
    hopes he wins, because he is beginning to like him and the game has 
    been going on for years, so it's difficult to come up with new and 
    exciting &quot;games&quot; for the audience to watch and enjoy. This 
    piece of dialogue is just an excuse to showcase some of the most vile 
    examples of human degradation (it's the only word that really fits 
    this film) put on screen, but the finale almost saves the film. 
    Almost, but no cigar. Fans of torture porn may like this film a lot 
    more than I did, as it is decently acted, but the low budget shows 
    itself often. For strong stomachs only!;<A NAME="InnerDemon2014"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;

    have been an excellent thriller if the last twenty minutes didn't 
    degenerate into a bunch of supernatural mumbo-jumbo with a real 
    annoying ending (which I am still waiting for anyone to tell me what 
    it means!). Teenager Sam (Sarah Jeavons) is babysitting her pre-teen 
    sister Maddy, when Maddy tells Sam she saw monsters under her bed. 
    Sam brings Maddie into her bedroom, looks under her bed and tells her 
    there are no monsters. Maddy asks what if there were and Sam says if 
    anyone dares lay a hand on her she would beat them to death with her 
    bare hands. When Maddy asks what would happen if the monsters killed 
    her, Sam replies, &quot;I would find a way to look after you even if 
    I were dead!&quot; This is about to become a living nightmare. In the 
    middle of the night, Sam is kidnapped by a husband/wife serial killer 
    team, Karl (Andreas Sobik) and Denise (Kerry Ann Reid), who break 
    into the house, throw Sam in the trunk of their car and drive off. 
    Sam, who is a survivor, manages to blow-out one of the car's back 
    tires from the trunk and when Karl opens the trunk to get the spare, 
    Sam belts him over the head with a tire iron and runs away in the 
    woods, with Denise chasing her. When Denise catches Sam, she belts 
    Denise over the head with the tire iron and begins to run away 
    further into the woods, but she falls down an embankment and tears 
    open her side something fierce. Bleeding profusely, Sam discovers a 
    house and breaks into it, not knowing that it is the house of Karl 
    and Denise. When she discovers who the house belongs to, she hides in 
    a pantry closet and spies on the serial killing pair through a hole 
    in the door. A local drug-dealing neighbor, Wayne (Todd Telford), 
    pays them a visit and begins to make not-so-veiled passes at Denise. 
    Karl pulls Wayne into the room where the pantry is located and Wayne 
    sees Sam peeping at them through the hole, but Karl doesn't believe 
    him, locking the pantry door (trapping Sam inside) and killing Wayne 
    after spouting weird Hansel &amp; Gretel passages and accusing Wayne 
    of fucking his wife. Denise cannot believe that Karl just killed

    him, saying to Karl, &quot;Clean up your own mess!&quot;), Sam uses 
    the sound of the chainsaw to try to escape from the pantry (we never 
    see Karl cutting Wayne's body into pieces, only hearing the noise of 
    the chainsaw), but she is unsuccessful. Things come to a head of 
    steam when Sam discovers that Maddy was also kidnapped, as she 
    watches Denise chase Maddy around the house, Sam screaming, &quot;I'll
     kill you!&quot; if she harms her sister.&nbsp; Denise kills Maddy by 
    stabbing her in the chest while Sam watches helplessly and screaming 
    &quot;I'll kill you!&quot; over and over. This is when the film takes 
    a 180&#176; turn into the supernatural. As Sam lays dying in the 
    pantry, Karl walks into the room and watches as Denise cuts her own 
    throat with a sharp knife and falls to the floor dead. Suddenly, the 
    ghosts of all their past female murder victims appear in the room and 
    kill Karl by tossing him through the air several times until he is a 
    bloody mess.&nbsp; The ghost of Maddy comes through the pantry door 
    and kills a dying Sam, saying to her, &quot;You failed!&quot; Sam 
    screams &quot;Noooo!&quot; (I guess they were flash-forwards, not 
    flashbacks!). The police arrive at the house and an EMT crew pull Sam 
    out of the pantry and shock her back to life with a defibrillator, 
    but when she opens her eyes, they are all red. THE END. WTF?!? It's 
    apparent that director/screenwriter Ursula Dabrowsky (Whose freshman 
    effort was titled <B><A HREF="family_demons_2009.htm">FAMILY DEMONS</A></B> 
    [2009]. I detect a trend forming!) had no idea how to end her 
    sophomore film, so she went with the old tried-and-true standard: 
    confusing the audience. About 40 minutes of the film are Sam in the 
    pantry, yet it is never boring, as she watches the normal life of a 
    married pair of serial killers go through their daily routine, 
    getting drunk on beer, doing drugs and insulting each other, but when 
    the supernatural junk kicks in, there's nothing in this twenty 
    minutes that are interesting at all. This could have been an ace 
    thriller if it weren't for the rushed horror elements. This film 
    comes from South Australia, so the scenery is nice and Karl has a 
    definite Slavic twang to his voice, so it also makes him stand out 
    from most Australian serial killer thrillers, especially <B><A HREF="wolf_creek_2004.htm">WOLF
     CREEK</A></B> (2004). Sarah Jeavons as Sam is simply amazing and 
    deserves all the accolades she received at film festivals, but the 
    film as a whole is very disappointing. Some may dig this 84-minute 
    movie, but I was expecting a lot more than I got. As a fan of films 
    from Australia, I must say I was let down, as this film had 
    potential, but the ball was dropped. It's well-made and acted, but 
    the story was lacking, especially the final twenty minutes.;<A NAME="HousesOctober2014"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     In recent years, there have been reports that Haunted House 
    attractions (called &quot;Haunts&quot;) that open expressly for the 
    Halloween Season have been going overboard in their violence and 
    scare tactics, injuring and maybe even killing their paying customers 
    (There was such a case in New Jersey, where a convicted rapist was 
    hired, without a background check, to portray a zombie at a haunt and 
    he was caught touching the women customers where they should never be 
    touched without their permission). In the film <B><A HREF="houses_october_built_2014.htm">THE

     BUILT</A></B> (2014), it takes this premise to the extreme, but 
    instead of being a thought-provoking horror flick, it drops the ball 
    with a giant THUD! The first sign is that it is a found footage film, 
    where the film opens with an onscreen scrawl that states the footage 
    was culled by the police and edited together from footage found on 
    the protagonists' cameras and from a haunt group called &quot;The 
    Blue Skeleton&quot;, which not only tells us that the protagonists 
    are dead or missing, but that the footage is going to be herky-jerky 
    &quot;shakey-cam&quot; and dark to the eyes, making it mostly 
    unwatchable. The main plot details five Texan friends, Bobby 
    (director/co-screenwriter Bobby Roe), Zack (producer/co-<A HREF="houses_october_built_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/houses october built poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>screenwriter
     Zack Andrews), Brandy (Brandy Schaefer), Mikey (Mikey Roe) and Jeff 
    (Jeff Larson), taking a road trip five days before Halloween to find 
    the perfect haunt, where the scares are palpable and it just may be 
    real. Jeff wants to find a haunted house collective known as &quot;The
     Blue Skeleton&quot;, who run a haunt that is said to be the ultimate 
    haunted house experience, but it won't be easy to find, as they will 
    have to solve puzzles and do other crap to find out where it is being 
    held this year. Each day, the group stops at a different haunt 
    (Including one where they use paintball guns to shoot at actors 
    dressed as zombies, which looks like a load of fun, that is if I 
    could actually see it!), where they cause trouble and get more 
    attention than they bargain for, such as being followed by a certain 
    clown and the creepy Porcelian Doll (Chlo&euml; Crampton; the best 
    damn thing in this film, as it is really a scary sight!), both of 
    which are probably working in cahoots with The Blue Skeleton. We see 
    much-too-dark footage of the group exploring each haunt and doing 
    things whaich are against each haunts' rules, such as climbing on the 
    roof of one haunted house and&nbsp; using their cameras inside the 
    haunts when it is strictly prohibited, so when bad things start 
    happening to them, all the viewers will say is &quot;Well, they 
    desereve it!&quot;, such as someone sneaking into their RV at night, 
    filming them while they sleep and posting it to the Internet. When 
    the group discovers the posted footage, instead of doing the sensible 
    thing and heading back home, they forge on ahead as if nothing is 
    wrong! This leads them to Louisiana, where The Blue Skeleton haunt is 
    being held and bad things happen to each and every one of them, which 
    is based on their worst fears (i.e. being buried alive; scared to 
    death of spiders; tortured while tied to a chair; attacked with a 
    chainsaw, etc). The film ends on a rather tenuous note, not telling 
    us if the group lives or dies, just so they can make <B><A HREF="houses_october_built_2_2017.htm">THE

    advance poster for the sequel says, &quot;It was never an ending...it 
    was an intermission&quot;, basically telling viewers of the first 
    film that we were taken for suckers and chumps. You should also be 
    aware that this is actually a remake of a 2011 ultra-low-budget film 
    of the same name featuring the same cast and crew, which won many 
    awards at film festivals. A little more money was tossed in for the 
    remake so it could be released to a wider audience.&nbsp; While not a 
    terrible film in the found footage genre, the middle drags so much 
    that most people will lose interest rather quickly. I know I did. 
    There is way too much shakey cam, that sickly-green (or black &amp; 
    white) night footage and a lot of the film is much too dark to see 
    without squinting (I was told to mess with my HD TV's contrast, but I 
    had a professional fine tune my TV to its optimal performance and I'm 
    not about to mess with it for a lousy found footage film!). I was 
    getting a severe headache watching this film, so I will not be 
    watching the sequel, even though readers of this site want me to. I 
    will not watch something just to get a headache, I need something 
    more. (Okay, I gave in! You can read my review of the sequel <A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad_page2.htm#HousesOctobr2-2017">HERE</A>.
     Does anyone have any Advil or Tylenol?) While some people will enjoy 
    this film (in all fairness, the cast of amateurs do a fine job 
    basically playing themselves, which is not an easy thing to do, and 
    some scenes are effective), I found it to be a task to get through, 
    as it lacks nudity and any graphic gore, at least none that is 
    visible to the naked eye. If this was made as a regular film without 
    all the handheld camera shots and better lighting, this would have 
    probably made it into the &quot;Good&quot; portion of this section, 
    but, as it stands, it was just not worth the trip for me. Others may 
    disagree and I salute them.;<A NAME="BatOuttaHell2014"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     No, <B><A HREF="bat_outta_hell_2014.htm">BAT OUTTA HELL</A></B> 
    (2014) is not a documentary about the making of Meat Loaf's iconic 
    1977 music album, instead it's a really poor semi-found footage 
    horror filck about ancient four-foot tall human-like bats (also 
    referred to as &quot;Devil Bats&quot; and &quot;Nightflyers&quot;) 
    who call the nearly-deserted Outback town (Yes, this is an Australian 
    horror flick) of &quot;<A HREF="bat_outta_hell_2014.htm#NowhereElse">Nowhere
     Else</A>&quot; (the shooting title of this film) their home. The 
    film opens in 1991, with a young woman being chased into the town's 
    chapel by one of the bats (thankfully, we don't fully see them until 
    the finale of the film), who is then killed by having her face ripped 
    off by the bat. We then switch to the year 2009, where reporter Zoe 
    (Di Lesson) arrives at a field hospital where a still living, but 
    unidentified, victim with their face ripped off has been admitted. 
    Zoe talks to a nurse (Sue Broberg), who says that she has no idea who 
    the victim is since their face has been torn off (Have they heard of 
    fingerprints? I hear that is a way to identify someone.), but the 
    victim had an expensive video camera which she intends to turn over 
    to the police. Zoe tells the nurse that her next stop is the police 
    station and offers to take the camera there. The nurse hands her the 
    camera and we then see Zoe going to her car and watching the footage 
    on the camera. It details the actions of a four-person crew of 
    surfing documentary filmmakers, Bianca (Rachael Murphy, who is a 
    horrendous actress), a young woman hiding a secret, Randy (Marco 
    Dapper), the handsome one of the group, Jack (Dan <A HREF="bat_outta_hell_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bat outta hell amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Balcaban),
     the level-headed member, and Chris (William Wensley) the 
    trouble-making member who has the hots for Bianca, who is not 
    interested in him, but is interested in Randy (he feels the same 
    about her), which makes Chris extremely jealous. The documentary crew 
    are having money troubles, so when a an unseen Russian benefactor 
    phones them with a non-surfing gig for lots of money, they jump on it 
    (Only Chris knows the gig is about the killer bats, as he wants the 
    lion's share of the loot for capturing footage of the bats). They are 
    supplied with an expensive camera by their Russian boss, but they 
    don't know it has a hidden GPS device inside it, so the Russian's 
    right-hand man, Boris (John Reynolds), can track their every move. 
    Long story short, they arrive in the town of Nowhere Else, meet the 
    tough-looking, shotgun-carrying Simson (Vernon Wells; <B><A HREF="mad_max_1979.htm">MAD
     MAX</A></B> - 1979, which gets name-dropped here, along with <B><A HREF="wolf_creek_2004.htm">WOLF
     CREEK</A></B> - 2004 and other Australian horror flicks), who seems 
    to be the only living resident of the town, and they then run out of 
    gas and are forced to stay at the chapel for the night, which turns 
    out to be the bats' home base. (God may build churches, but the Devil 
    builds Chapels!). When Chris is the first to be killed by getting his 
    face ripped off and Jack seems to suffer the same fate (we never see 
    him die), we have to ask ourselves, &quot;Who is the victim in the 
    hospital?&quot; During the non-ending finale, we learn that it was 
    Simson's wife who was killed in the chapel in 1991 and, ever since 
    then, he's been stalking and killing the bats, hoping to find their 
    Queen (The bats offer the ripped-off faces of their victims to their 
    Queen as a tribute). Randy offers to follow Simson, but he is only 
    looking for Bianca, whom has disappeared (Simson finds Bianca's 
    crucifix necklace with blood on it in the chapel's cemetery). We then 
    are back at the hospital, where a bat has killed the victim in their 
    hospital room, when the nurse opens the window to get some fresh air. 
    The bat then kills Zoe in her car. THE END. I can't begin to tell you 
    how bad this film is, but director/producer/screenwriter Danial Donai 
    (his freshman effort, as he is a stuntman by trade) offers us a film 
    that's an editing disaster (random scenes just pop-up without any 
    connective tissue to the scene before it) and once you see the bats 
    in their full glory, you will do one of two things: 1.) Laugh 
    yourself silly until you pass out, or, 2.) Kick-in your TV screen 
    after witnessing the crappiest CGI creations ever committed to the 
    screen. But my biggest problem here is the footage Zoe watches in her 
    car, as it is full of camera shots that couldn't have possibly been 
    filmed by the crew, as it is full of the Bats' sickly green POV 
    footage, scenes of Simson talking to his dog when the crew has 
    already left and Chris secretly stealing Simson's book on cryptids 
    when we can plainly see that Bianca doesn't have the camera turned 
    on! It's sloppiness like this that makes this film hard to swallow. I 
    actually wanted to spit it out once I saw the bats in all their 
    glory. As a matter of fact, it would have been a better film if we 
    never saw them at all, because it was quite obvious that the budget 
    couldn't afford good CGI. The acting is also horrid (except for 
    Vernon Wells, who was given an Associate Producer credit) and the 
    film moves at a snail's pace. Do youself a favor and let this one 
    pass you by. Why does every new film by a freshman director have to 
    be a found footage flick? I know they are cheap to make, but if you 
    don't have anything original to offer, why bother? <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">UPDATE:</FONT></B> 
    I just discovered that there are two versions of this film streaming 
    on the Internet! The version on YouTube (from channel &quot;Horror 
    Central&quot;) is exactly as I describe it above, but the version 
    streaming on Amazon Prime is completely different, while the story 
    remains the same. It totally excises the 1991 opening and has 
    different opening credits. It also changes the unseen Russian 
    benefactor's voice from Russian to American and there are scenes in 
    the film that are not in the YouTube version and vice-versa. I didn't 
    watch the entire Prime version, because why torture myself with a 
    film I didn't like? It still contains the same lousy actors and plot, 
    so I turned it off about 15 minutes into it. It also runs five 
    minutes longer than the YouTube version. That would have been five 
    minutes I would never get back! If someone wants to compare both 
    versions, I will gladly list the differences here and give you credit.</FONT></FONT></P>

    unmovable camera pointed at a laptop screen (and the whole film is

    Gabriadze does a good job of making us believe that), while a girl 
    and her five friends talk on a <A HREF="unfriended_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/unfriended 2015 blu-ray2 front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>video
     chat using Skype, Facebook, Google and IM each other and there's 
    also someone mysterious (who knows how to use a computer better than 
    any programmer I have ever seen) also in on the chat with them that 
    they can't get rid of. It is the anniversary of a girl's suicide (we 
    see her shoot herself in the head in a parking lot after being 
    cyber-bullied in a LiveLeak video, which does lend this film a shred 
    of credence) and it seems like her spirit may be that unknown person 
    (all the people in on the chat knew the girl, some quite better than 
    others), because this supernatural person has knowledge that tears 
    the friends apart before making them all commit suicide one-by-one 
    (or at least make them look like suicides). I almost gave this film a 
    positive review because it held my attention until I realized it 
    showed me nothing. Everytime someone killed themselves (the fat guy 
    in the chat stuffs his hand in the running blades of a blender, but 
    you can barely make it out), their video feed would freeze and become 
    more blocky. I'm sure this played much better in a theater with a 
    young audience (especially that old wives tale of not ever answering 
    a dead person's question, now updated to never answering a dead 
    persons email or IM and the only way to remove the curse is to 
    confess your sins, which leads to all types of shouting and nasty 
    secrets revealed), but the fact that it is Rated R takes most of the 
    people this film was made for out of the equation (especially in 
    States that dictate you must be 18 years or over to see an R-Rated 
    film without a guardian). It did manage to get some positive reviews 
    (and I understand why, because even I stopped what I was doing to 
    watch the whole damn thing on HBO when it premiered, because you have 
    to read a whole damn bunch of typing during the film), but the movie 
    amounts to absolutely nothing and answers no questions at all (at 
    least not the most important ones). Most aggravating is the non-ending
     which shows a pair of hands shut the laptop screen that we were 
    looking at for the preceding 82 minutes. It's a unique and valiant 
    try, but there has to be some meat on the bone to make it satisfying. 
    All this film has are bones that have been chewed to the marrow. It 
    made nearly 31 million dollars in the four weeks it was in theaters. 
    That's quite a good profit margin, but more than half of it was made 
    in the first week of release. And a word of advice to Universal 
    Studios: Never state that a film came from the makers of <B><A HREF="ouija_2014.htm">OUIJA</A></B>,

    (1980), only this time a bus-full of teenagers (filmed in Austin, 
    Texas) are headed to the middle of the woods for Church Camp and are 
    slowly being killed one-by-one by the titled character, a huge masked 
    killer whose favorite tools are a double-bladed axe and a long metal 
    spear (He aso wheels two huge pancakes with him on a cart!). Oh, and 
    it's a comedy (most of the jokes fall flat, although there are a few 
    funny ones, especially one with an Asian student, two rubber balls 
    and a butcher's knife), where the church teens swear worse than a 
    truck driver, strip naked at the drop of a hat and do more drugs than 
    your local juvenile delinquents. On the trail is Dr. Peter Shirtcliff 
    (Michael Madsen, the only name actor in the film, who gives a strange 
    performance), who stops at a local supply post and fills his pockets 
    with shotgun shells. Are the shells meant for the teenagers or the 
    monumental Lumberjack? We soon find out when Dr. Shirtcliff goes to 
    the local Ranger station and tells them that the woods should be 
    closed because of evil lurking there every 30 years since 1892 (don't 
    do the math; it doesn't match up unless the film takes place in 2012) 
    and this is the time for it to happen again (He survived an attack 
    when he was a child). The Rangers kick him out of the station with 
    Shirtcliff telling them they are both going to die. One Ranger takes 
    pity on the doctor (there's a meatloaf recipe on one of the newspaper 
    articles the doctor gives to the Rangers and he wants to keep the 
    newspaper article so he can make the meatloaf!) and gives him the 
    directions to the Church Camp. While there are some good bloody kills 
    (most of them practical), especially in the beginning when after the 
    bus driver drops off the teenagers at the camp, he picks up a couple 
    of hookers and they all do a bag of cocaine together while the bus is 
    stopped. While the bus driver is performing oral sex on the hookers, 
    the Lumberjack enters the back emergency exit and chops both of the 
    topless hookers' heads off with his axe (both of their heads go 
    flying out the windows) and he impales the bus driver's head&nbsp; to 
    the roof of the bus with his steel spear. We also see him tear the 
    heads off of two people with his bare hands and bend a female student 
    into a position not capable for a human body for use as a table to 
    eat his giant pancakes, but he picks her up and throws the 
    still-alive girl against a tree when he is unable to facilitate her 
    body as a table. While director/editor Josh Bear (usually a video 
    game director) offers plenty of nudity and hard R-Rated violence (one 
    girl gets caught in the old rope in a bent tree booby-trap trick and 
    the Lumberjack sticks a spigot in her forehead while she is hanging 
    upside down and then turns it on, as we watch the blood flow out of 
    her body; the obviously gay camp counselor is cut in two with a tree 
    saw, as he watches his lower body run away; and one of the Rangers 
    [the meatloaf-loving one] is forced to eat his own heart after the 
    Lumberjack pulls it out and shoves it in his mouth), the mere fact 
    that the film is 105 minutes long makes it an ordeal to get through, 
    especially when he throws in a food fight, some animation as Dr. 
    Shirtcliff explains the curse to the rest of the Church Camp (they 
    throw him out of the camp and a few minutes later the Lumberjack 
    attacks everyone in the cafeteria while they are eating pancakes) and 
    a bunch of sequences that should have been cut from the film. Only 
    for those that have to see every slasher film (One good point: A 
    Black man survives!). Oh, and the Lumberjack's kryptonite is syrup!

    (2015) and considering the talent in front of the camera, this one is 
    even more disappointing than the film above this one. It seems that 
    some company named Clubirch Industries (headed by Ray Wise in a 
    cameo) are experimenting on animals genetically so they will survive 
    and not go extinct in today's world. We then see a photographer and 
    his two bikini models (there's hardly any nudity, so don't get your 
    hopes up) go on a photo shoot deep in the Alaskan wilderness 
    (actually filmed in Fairbanks, Alaska) and are soon being attacked 
    and torn apart by one of Clubirch's genetically-enhanced polar bears. 
    The main problems with this film are that the attacks scenes has the 
    camera shaking wildly and most attacks take place at night and are 
    vastly underlit to see the gore or even the polar bear (actually a 
    man in a costume). That's a shame because James Remar plays the head 
    of the lodge the photographer and the models are staying at; Sherilyn 
    Fenn is a Clubirch scientist who knows more than she is telling and 
    Graham Greene plays the guy who has the only means of communication 
    with the civilized world. There are some interesting scenes, such as 
    when the mutant polar bear travels underneath the ice (cracking it as 
    he heads closer) and makes a meal out of one of the bikini models and 
    the Eskimo guide there to protect them by pulling them both through a 
    fishing hole drilled through the ice for the photo shoot, but since 
    85% of the kills take place during the night, it's quite a 
    disappointment. Especially the ending, when mortally wounded Remar 
    has the spinning ice drill attached to a snowmobile and drills the 
    polar bear to death just before it kills Fenn (everyone else is 
    dead). Too bad we really can't see anything. The poster for the film 
    is very bright but that is just false advertising. We only get one 
    quick good look at the polar bear's head, otherwise it is just a 
    black object on security cameras or when it attacks. Director Hank

    2010; <B><A HREF="gallows_2015.htm">THE GALLOWS</A></B> (2015) is 
    just another shitty &quot;found footage&quot; film about a killer 
    spirit haunting a high school at night. The film opens in 1993 (we 
    can tell by the date stamped on the bottom left of the video camera's 
    screen) as a mother and father tape their son, Charlie Grimille, who 
    has the lead in the play &quot;The Gallows&quot;. He was actually the 
    understudy, but the lead actor got sick, and Charlie, who was 
    supposed to play the hangman is now the lead. Unfortunately, 
    something goes wrong during the hanging scene and Charlie is hanged 
    for real (he went from being the hangman to being a hanged man) and 
    dies in a freak accident, all while his father is taping it. Cut to 
    2013, and the high school decides to put on &quot;The Gallows&quot; 
    again as a 20th Anniversary tribute to Charlie (this is one school 
    that should not be accredited). Ryan (Ryan Shoos) is the totally 
    unlikable jackass who videotapes everything, especially his football 
    jock friend Reese (Reese Mishler), who has the lead in the play and 
    can't act his way out of a paper bag. Ryan talks Reese into going 
    into the school the night before the opening of the play and 
    destroying the sets, so the play will be called off and Reese will 
    not have to act in it. Ryan discovers that there's a door in the 
    school right next to the stage that leads outside that refuses to 
    lock when closed, so he, Reese and cheerleader Cassidy (Cassidy 
    Gifford; Cathy Lee and the late Frank Gifford's daughter) enter the 
    high school that night and begin to destroy the set, when lead 
    actress Pfeifer (Pfeifer Brown; and, yes, everyone uses their real 
    first names), who Reese has a crush on, appears and strange things 
    begin to happen. First, the door that never locks is now locked, as 
    is every other door in the school. Then a TV starts to play a copy of 
    Charlie's father's videotape of his son's deadly hanging from 1993, 
    until the foursome discover there is no VHS tape in the VCR. Then a 
    spirit appears (most probably Charlie's) and begins to kill the 
    invaders one-by-one using a noose as a weapon. Cassidy is the first 
    to go when a noose appears around her neck (where a strange rash 
    appeared from an earlier encounter)&nbsp; and she is dragged across 
    the floor screaming into the darkness. The rest of the film follows 
    99% of found footage conventions, including that sickly green night 
    vision, the camera shaking wildly whenever something remotely 
    interesting appears on the screen, lights flickering when a death is 
    about to occur and people refusing to put down the camera when they 
    should be running for their lives. The fact that it took two 
    directors/screenwriters (Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing) to come up 
    with 81 minutes of tripe (the Blu-Ray contains the original 2012 
    version of the film, which was then re-shot almost completely at 
    Warner Bros./Blumhouse Productions insistence, even though the film 
    was self-financed) and has no discernable conclusion (When two 
    policemen arrive, the killer, who wears a stitched-together leather 
    mask, stares into the camera's lens [after killing the cops] before 
    the screen goes black. What statement does that make? That there will 
    be a sequel? God, I hope not!) only proves that the majority of found 
    footage films are worthless. So is this one. If you were to tell me 
    back in 1999 that found footage films would still be around in 2015, 
    I would have called you a liar. But audiences keep watching this 
    dreck (I have to, you don't), making people think that anyone can 
    become a director. Guess what? They can't. Skill is involved and you 
    need more than a vanilla screenplay; I was never a fan of the <B><A HREF="insidious_trilogy_2010-2015.htm">INSIDIOUS</A></B><A HREF="insidious_trilogy_2010-2015.htm"> Trilogy</A> 
    (2010, 2013 &amp; 2015) and the same goes for <B><A HREF="insidious_trilogy_2010-2015.htm">INSIDIOUS
     CHAPTER 3</A></B> (2015), which is actually a prequel to the first 
    two films, the only thing good about all three films is Lin Shaye as 
    medium Elise Rainier and the only reason I am reviewing this movie at 
    all is because of her. In this film, she gets a lot (and I mean a 
    lot) of screen time and she kicks spirit butt. I always liked Lin 
    Shaye as an actress, even in some of the awful films she has been in 
    (look up her filmography on IMDb), because she alway displays a sense 
    of class to anything she does. The main story, about a teenage girl 
    who lost her mother and brings Elise out of retirement because she 
    has become possessed by a spirit from the other side, is as old as 
    films themselves, but whenever Lin Shaye is on screen, you just can't 
    take her eyes off of her, because she has a sense of humor and is the 
    authority at the same time. This segment of the trilogy was directed 
    by Leigh Wannell (the first two were directed by James Wan and 
    Wannell wrote all three films), who also appears in all three films 
    as half the duo of a paranormal investigative team (Angus Sampson is 
    the other member, who has also been in all three films) and the only 
    thing this film does, besides display Lin Shaye's talent, is show us 
    how all three became a team. Unfortunately, you have to watch the 
    whole movie to get to that part and a shock ending which ties this to 
    the first film. These PG-13 &amp; R Rated supernatural horror films 
    are all beginning to blend together in my mind (many of them made by 
    Blumhouse Productions, who also made these three films, as well as

    as well as too many more to count). Whatever happened to good, 
    old-fashioned gory horror in theaters? Even teens don't want to see 
    these type of films anymore. They make all their money on their first 
    week of release because most of them were made for less than 5 
    million dollars and then are dropped to VOD and disc, before quickly 
    turning up on pay cable. Please, someone make these films stop and 
    give Lin Shaye more to do. She deserves better than this; I wanted to 
    like <B><A HREF="into_the_grizzly_maze_2015.htm">INTO THE GRIZZLY MAZE</A></B> 
    (2015), when I realized that it was just an imitation of director 
    William Girdler's <B><A HREF="grizzly_1976.htm">GRIZZLY</A></B> 
    (1976), but with some slight differences. This film is also bloodier 
    and has a great cast, but they are basically wasted in roles that 
    amount to nothing. Ex-con Rowan (James Marsden), who was just 
    released from prison for murder (it's not what it seems to be, as we 
    learn later on), returns to his Alaskan home town to pay respects to 
    his dead father by going to the &quot;Grizzly Maze&quot;, the 
    location where he died and is one of the most dense places in the 
    forest where people get lost on a regular basis. His brother Beckett 
    (Thomas Jane, who is the Christopher George character in the original 
    film), a local cop, is not to keen on seeing his brother again (he 
    still thinks of him as a cold-blooded murderer, even though he 
    isn't), but Beckett's boss, Sully (Scott Glenn), talks him into 
    taking Rowan back to his house (Rowan has just beaten a pimp to a 
    bloody pulp for hitting a prostitute that <A HREF="into_the_grizzly_maze_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/into the grizzly maze 2015 poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>he
     refused to have sex with) to cool off. There is also a killer giant 
    Grizzly bear in the area that begins snacking on people in the 
    Grizzly Maze (we see a dismembered hand still holding a chainsaw that 
    is stuck in a tree and various other body parts and chewed bodies, 
    the only reason to watch the film; there is also a heavily cut PG-13 
    version floating around that you should avoid if you want to watch 
    this). The bear is not electronically tagged and Beckettt has no idea 
    where it came from. Enter hunter Douglass (Billy Bob Thornton) and 
    his horse (basically playing the Richard Jaeckel role in Girdler's 
    film; Thornton, not the horse), who offers to put the killer grizzly 
    down, but Beckett wants to catch it (God knows what for). The next 
    morning, Rowan heads towards the Grizzly Maze to pay his respects, 
    when he saves a deaf woman named Kaley (Michaela McManus) from the 
    killer grizzly when she gets caught in a non-lethal bear trap. 
    Beckett and friend Michelle (Piper Perabo) head to the Grizzly Maze 
    to find Beckett's wife and soon all four end up together after some 
    close calls from the bear (the entire film uses a real bear, no 
    animatronics), with Douglass and his horse also out there to kill the 
    bear. Sully, who is dirtier than a Mexican drug lord, also shows up, 
    because he looks the other way when poachers illegally kill bears for 
    their gall bladders (Google it). It all comes down to chase after 
    chase (I do have to say that it is nice to see a real bear chasing a 
    person, played by Bart the Bear), where no one knows how to shoot a 
    gun (except Douglass), because they keep on missing him and it 
    concludes with Sully having his face chewed off and a seriously 
    injured Douglass (one of his ears is hanging from his head), pumping 
    three high powered bullets into the bear before he runs out of ammo 
    and is killed (everyone seems to run out of ammo at the most 
    inopportune times). Just when you think the bear has been burned to 
    death, he jumps out of the fire and attacks the motorized police 
    raft, knocking everyone overboard. It takes Rowan to kill the bear, 
    using only a knife! Director David Hackl (<B><A HREF="saw_franchise_2004-2010.htm">SAW
     V</A></B> - 2008) keeps things moving at a fast pace, but there is 
    nothing new here that you haven't seen before, even though the cast 
    is exceptional. Screenwriters Guy Moshe (who also wrote/directed the 
    wonderfully strange <B><A HREF="bunraku_2010.htm">BUNRAKU</A></B> - 
    2010) and first-time feature writer J.R. Reher (based on his story) 
    offers nothing but cliche after cliche until it becomes a game of 
    &quot;spot where you have seen this scene before&quot;. There have 
    been many killer bear movies and this is just another regular one, 
    although it is bloody. Whether you want to watch it or not is up to 
    you. Look for actor Michael Beach in a cameo in the beginning of the 
    film; <B><A HREF="bloodsucking_bastards_2015.htm">BLOODSUCKING BASTARDS</A></B> 
    (2015) is a poor imitation horror comedy that tries to mix elements 
    of the classic <B><A HREF="office_space_1999.htm">OFFICE SPACE</A></B> 
    (1999) with a horror film and it fails terribly (Those positive 
    reviews on IMDb were probably written by people who worked on the 
    film). A failing company in which a bunch of slacker workers show up 
    any time they want to play video games on their computers (their last 
    ditch effort to keep the company alive is a male enhancement pill 
    which turns your dick green as a side effect!) are taken by surprise 
    when one of their own has not been appointed the new manager, but a 
    stranger has (he is a stranger to some, a scumbag to others). One of 
    the workers is also in trouble with his co-worker Human Resources 
    girlfriend when she says she loves him at dinner and all he says is 
    &quot;No!&quot; (Could you actually say anything worse?). Meanwhile, 
    low-level workers in the building are being killed, but it turns out 
    the new manager is actually a vampire and wants to turn the entire 
    work force (including the janitor) into blood-thirsty vampires who 
    will make a winning work force and the company something to contend 
    with. The last four humans not bitten begin to kill the vampires 
    (when vampires are staked in the heart or have their heads cut off, 
    they explode into geysers of blood, but we never see a body explode, 
    just blood being thrown on the actors). The only fun to be had here 
    is two friends, one a vampire and the other human, trying to decide 
    how to resolve this problem. They eventually manage to let each other 
    go their own way, which sets the final scene into action, opening the 
    film for a sequel. While the acting is good, 80% of the jokes fall 
    flat and the horror elements fail terribly (all we get is a paper 
    cutter blade planted into a couple of vampire heads and a very quick 
    decapitation). If director/actor Brian James O'Connell (he has a 
    small part here as the mail boy), who has directed two non-horror 
    films before this, wants to get into horror, stop the inane comedy 
    and make a horror film where there is more than just throwing blood 
    on the actors. Sorry, I can't recommend this film, even though it is 
    distributed on disc by one of my favorite DVD companies, <A HREF="http://www.screamfactorydvd.com">Scream
     Factory</A>; Imagine if you will that a group of actors have to 
    improvise an entire horror film and only one actor at a time is told 
    what should be going on. Sounds intriguing, doesn't it? Well, <B><A HREF="murder_in_the_dark_2013-2015.htm">MURDER
     IN THE DARK</A></B> (2013/2015), another film that was part of the 
    2015 After Dark <B><A HREF="8_films_to_die_for_2015.htm">8 FILMS TO 
    DIE FOR</A></B>, is a complete bore from start to finish and it's not 
    the actors' fault because they are fine (as is the scenery). The 
    problem stems from the actors not knowing what to do in certain 
    circumstances and the cameraman trying to keep them in frame. The 
    story involves seven people from various countries, races and 
    religions, picking up an English-speaking hitch-hiker on the road 
    (always a good idea) to help them find an old isolated medieval town 
    complete with a castle in Turkey. Once they get to the castle (which 
    is a beautiful character unto itself), they play a game of 
    &quot;Murder In The Dark&quot; (the rules are still very fuzzy to me) 
    and before you can say &quot;Turkish Taffy&quot;, people from the 
    group begin dying and not in very interesting ways. Turns out there 
    is more than one murderer in the group, but the main murderer is a 
    black market human organ seller and he is attacked and killed by one 
    of his victims in the end. During the closing credits, 
    director/co-screenwriter Dagen Merrill (<B><A HREF="beneath_2007.htm">BENEATH</A></B> 
    - 2007) and his crew try to explain their experiment in filmmaking 
    while dealing with the corrupt Turkish police and threatening 
    populace (one who carries a pickaxe), who demand more money to let 
    them keep on filming. It's the most interesting part of the film, but 
    it's too bad that you have to get through 85 excrutiating minutes to 
    get to it. The murders are boring and not gory at all (as a matter of 
    fact, you hardly see anything except a knife being thrust into one 
    guy's neck) and the cameraman and editor seem to be tripping out on 
    hashish (watch it if you dare to see what I mean). This film was made 
    in 2013, but not released until late in 2015, so that should tell you 
    all you need to know about the movie. So far that is three out of the

    (1973) retread with a good final twist, but is it worth waiting for? 
    A family gather together at Hannah's (Michele Hicks) house on the 
    first anniversary of her 3 year-old daughter Emma's death and it's 
    not any family I want to be part of. The entire film is shown in 
    flashback, as the survivors talk to police psychiatrist Dr. Woods 
    (Eric Roberts, in a larger role than usual) about what happened on 
    that fateful weekend. Bethany (Sienna Guillory), who is bothered by 
    her and Hannah's mother Jean (Karen Austin) when she and her husband 
    are going to give her a grandchild, is possessed by a spirit, who 
    first screws her doggie style in her bedroom and then begins the 
    usual things, like objects moving on their own, throwing up, turning 
    her head around 360&#176; (a very quick and good effect, but if you 
    blink, you will miss it), talking in a deep voice and name-dropping 
    the original film (which is the biggest sin of all). All if this 
    happens after a medium performs a seance, one of the most widely used 
    tropes in possession films.&nbsp; During this whole possession 
    crisis, personal demons come to the forefront, like finding out 
    Hannah threw Emma down the stairs and killed her, Bethany's husband 
    killing someone in a car a year ago, Hannah's husband being an 
    adulterer, Hannah exposing her breasts to a priest (Heath Freeman) 
    and kissing him, who was called in to perform an exorcism (not a good 
    move for the priest), and Jean being found dead hanging from a tree 
    when she leaves the house on the first night and promises to return 
    the next morning with a psychiatrist. It's nothing we haven't seen 
    done 100 times before, but there is a surprise at the end which 
    almost redeems the film. Be on the lookout for Sonja Kinski (she has 
    an important part in the film), who is the granddaughter of Klaus 
    Kinski and daughter of Nastassja Kinski (you'll be able to notice the 
    resemblance almost immediately). Director Jay Alaimo (his first 
    horror film, but he has directed other films) keeps the blood and 
    gore down to a minimum, which makes this movie even harder to watch. 
    Originally made in 2012, but it didn't make its U.S. debut until late 
    in 2015. That right there is all you need to know. This is the fourth 
    film in the collection I didn't care for. None of them are badly 
    made, but I can say the only thing they do for me is make me say 
    &quot;Meh&quot;. Four more to go. I am hoping they are better; <B><A HREF="intruders_2015.htm">INTRUDERS</A></B> 
    (2015) starts off really good, but quickly degenerates into mediocre 
    territory. A woman named Anna (Beth Riesgraf), who suffers from 
    agoraphobia (the film was initially to be titled <B>SHUT<A HREF="intruders_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/intruders 2015 poster8a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="146" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> IN</B>,
     when Naiomi Watts was slated to star in it), hasn't stepped out of 
    house for years. She takes care of her bedridden brother, who tells 
    Anna she should forgive their father for raping her consistently when 
    she was younger. She has never forgiven him for that, but it is plain 
    to see that there is more to Anna than meets the eye. When her 
    brother dies, she inherits his money and offers some of it to her 
    only friend, Dan (Rory Culkin), who delivers food to the house daily, 
    but he refuses to take it. The next day, the house is invaded by 
    three men looking for Anna's money, but Anna turns the tables on them 
    when it is revealed that the basement of the house is tricked-out 
    with booby traps (the disappearing stairs is a cool effect) and 
    cameras so Anna can keep eye on them. Why was this done? Well, Anna 
    and her brother use to trap rapists down there to &quot;fix 
    them&quot;, which usually meant that they would shoot themselves in 
    the head with a revolver with a single bullet or hang themselves with 
    a noose. Her brother killed their father as a way to fix him for 
    raping Anna, but Anna seems to enjoy it a lot more now that she does 
    it by herself without her brother around. Things take a bad turn when 
    Dan shows up at the house to tell Anna how her brother's funeral went 
    (she was too afraid to step out of the house to go) and steps 
    smack-dab into the middle of the home invasion. Dan knows one of the 
    intruders, so Anna thinks he is in on it (he isn't, at least not 
    purposely) and breaks two of Dan's fingers and pushes him down into 
    the cellar, where he dislocates his knee (one of the guys pops it 
    back into place in the film's most intense moment). A game of cat and 
    mouse ensues and three people die. It won't be fair to tell you which 
    ones they are, but the ending is so unbelievable, I was banging my 
    head on the coffee table. Freshman feature director Adam Schindler, 
    working with a screenplay by T.J. Cimfel &amp; David White, shows 
    talent and tension in some of the scenes (but very little blood or 
    gore), but the whole plot about the house being tricked out by Anna 
    and her brother to punish rapists is just too unbelievable to get 
    over. A valiant try, but no cigar. Notice how the poster art of the 
    film bears a <A HREF="cabin_in_the_woods_2009_intruders_2015_poster_art.htm">remarkable
     similarity</A> to <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#CabinInTheWoods">THE

    underneath (in the beginning, after finding a huge egg at a beach 
    party and it hatches the next morning, one guy tries to save a 
    topless girl (the only nudity in the film) and falls face-first into 
    the sand, where his right eye and half his face are eaten away before 
    he is sucked under the sand. (If you are looking for a rapist to have 
    his dick yanked-off like in the first film, you will be 
    disappointed.). The rest of the film consists of six party-goers 
    waking up the next morning in a car, a lifeguard's station and a

    guy!), trying to find a way off the sand before they are sucked 
    under, too. The creature seems to consist of little hair-like 
    tentacles which are poisonous to the touch and if you are bitten by 
    just one, your body will dissolve from the inside out in due time 
    (the tentacles get bigger as the film progresses). If I make this 
    film sound interesting at all, I apologize because it is just a bunch 
    of annoying people, all with backstories releated to each other 
    (ex-boyfriend and girlfriend; fat black guy [Cleo Berry] who fell 
    asleep at the party, so they draw a giant penis on his face with 
    magic marker; jealous new girlfriend; etc.) and it is boring as hell. 
    I like the similarly-themed &quot;The Raft&quot; episode from <B><A HREF="creepshow_2_1987.htm">CREEPSHOW
     2</A></B> (1987) a whole lot more and there is absolutely no humor 
    to be found here like the hotdog-throwing scene at Burt Young in <B>BLOOD
     BEACH</B> (even with the missing scenes, this new film should be 
    considered a remake of that film because there are too many other 
    similarities to count, especially the fully-revealed badly rendered 
    monster [shown way too fast to make out it's shape underwater] being 
    shown in the end heading for a more populated beach). This is just 
    another sub-par DTV horror film that floods the market in which the 
    only recognizable star, Jamie Kennedy (who is given star status), 
    puts in an extended cameo as a Beach Patrol officer who accuses them 
    all of being on drugs (&quot;Who's got the Molly?&quot;) before his 
    arm is eaten off and he is sucked under the sand. Screen time = 5 
    minutes. Since most of the gore is of the CGI variety, that is also a 
    big negative. Director Isaac Gabaeff (his only directorial horror 
    film) shot this film in 12 days and it looks it. Save your time for a 
    film that is worth it. This isn't it.; In the town of Dillford (Home 
    of the Riblet), humans, vampires and zombies live in peace, even 
    going to high school together. So begins the so-so <B><A HREF="freaks_of_nature_2015.htm">FREAKS

    men are late bloomers, but when it happens, Dag will find himself 
    sporting a huge penis!). Then, one day, a gigantic alien spacecraft 
    hovers over Dillford and all hell breaks loose. Humans, vampires and 
    zombies begin to turn on each other and human Dag, vampire Petra 
    (Mackenzie Davis; <B><A HREF="martian_2015.htm">THE MARTIAN</A></B> - 
    2015) and zombie Ned (Josh Fadem; <B><A HREF="amigo_undead_2015.htm">AMIGO
     UNDEAD</A></B> - 2015) join forces and try to figure out how to 
    defeat the aliens, who finally come down to Earth and use their 
    tentacled bodies to make the human bodies they touch explode (During 
    a fight, Ned bites the finger off a vampire and spits it in his 
    mouth, causing the vampire to choke on his own finger. It is one of 
    the few truly funny scenes in this film.). When a nude Dag becomes 
    invisible to the aliens, it becomes apparent that the aliens can see 
    only inorganic material like clothing, so Petra and Ned strip naked 
    (we see absolutely nothing except their bare asses) to go to Dag's 
    house to check on his parents, only to have Ned get eaten by the 
    aliens trying to protect Dag (Truth be told, they aren't eaten, but 
    &quot;rematerialized&quot; at a big box store like CostCo, creating a 
    force field to separate the humans, the vampires and the zombies. 
    Since Dag killed the alien that grabbed Ned, he rematerializes at the 
    parking lot of the local Little Caesars!). It seems all the aliens 
    want is the chemical additive that is part to the town's famous 
    Riblets to make it taste like actual meat. Give the aliens that 
    ingredient and they will leave Earth. But humans are not that giving 
    and a fight breaks out after a giant alien with a German accent tells 
    them through Billy Joel's lyrics of &quot;We Didn't Start The 
    Fire&quot; what awful people we are and Dag's late-blooming appears 
    (it's the film's only surprise and not what you think). The rest of 
    the film is mostly supposedly funny gags and banter (along with some 
    bloody effects, some physical, some CGI), but director Robbie 
    Pickering (his first horror feature), working with a screenplay by 
    Oren Uziel, fail to make the film memorable. Too many questions are 
    left unanswered, like how one town one the United States can have 
    humans, vampires and zombies living together in peace (<B><A HREF="true_blood_cable_series.htm">TRUE
     BLOOD</A></B> this ain't!) and why zombies go to school at all, 
    since they are incapable of learning. With stars like Ed Westwick, 
    Denis Leary, Patton Oswalt and Keegan-Michael Key also involved, you 
    would think that this would be an enjoyable horror comedy, but it 
    turns out just to be slightly bearable. Too bad, I was hoping I would 
    love this. As it stands, I barely like it. The town is now known as 
    Dillford, The Home of the Vegetarian Riblet.; SyFy's <B><A HREF="hollow_2015.htm">THE
     HOLLOW</A></B> (2015) is your typical SyFy Original Film, CGI 
    monster and all.&nbsp; Three girls, Marley (Sarah Dugdale), Sarah 
    (Stephanie Hunt) and her younger sister Emma (Alisha Newton) who has 
    prophetic dreams that come true, travel to an auction on a remote 
    island to make some money after Sarah and Emma's parents were killed 
    in an accident. They are told by another passenger, Toby (Dylan 
    Playfair), on the ferry to the island that on Halloween Night (which 
    is tomorrow), a few years ago, many people were mysteriously killed 
    on the island. Emma doesn't want to go because she sees a monster in 
    her dreams and so far, everything she has dreamed has come true. They 
    go to visit their Aunt Cora (an unrecognizable Deborah Kara Unger; <B><A HREF="silent_hill_2006.htm">SILENT
     HILL</A></B> - 2006) who is all bloody and near death. She tells 
    them to get off the island before &quot;it&quot; gets them. That 
    &quot;it&quot; is a terrible CGI creation made of twigs and fire who 
    grabs people and burns them to death (Hey, don't twigs catch fire, 
    too?). They siphon gas from their car to Aunt Cora's vehicle when she 
    is literally comes flying through the front door and grabs Sarah by 
    the leg, with twigs coming out of her hand and wrapping itself around 
    Sarah's leg. Marley has to chop off Aunt Cora's hand with an ax to 
    stop the twigs from moving. They head towards town with the monster 
    close behind to try and find Emma, who ends up missing, as it begins 
    killing the townspeople, the first being grocery store owner Donald 
    (Garry Chalk). It the tries to drag Marley under a car, but local cop 
    Alex (Jonathan Whitesell) puts a few shotgun shells into the 
    monster's fiery face and it lets go. They all gather at the local 
    diner, which has a big walk-in freezer (I think we know how this is 
    going to end up). In the film's best scene, which is a take-off on 
    the opening of <B><A HREF="bonanza_burning_map.htm">BONANZA</A></B>, 
    one of the locals point out an abandoned electrical power station on 
    a map, when it catches on fire and the monster's hand comes through 
    the burning hole and grabs Alex by the head, killing him. Sarah And 
    Marley head toward the abandoned electrical plant, where they learn 
    that the monster buries its victims under a thick brush of twigs to 
    eat later (like a bear). Sarah finds Emma under a grave of twigs and 
    she is still alive, but hurt. All three girls find the entrance to 
    the underground power plant with the monster walking on the ceiling 
    following them. Marley sacrifices her life for the two sisters and 
    they escape the power plant the same way they came in. The monster 
    goes to grab Sarah by the head, but the sun comes up and Halloween is 
    over, so the monster dissolves into a burst of sparks and Sarah and

    (2010), directors/writers Luca Boni &amp; Marco Ristori and like that 
    film, it is presented and produced by Uwe Boll (who quit filmmaking). 
    Something tells me that you don't have to watch <B><A HREF="zombie_massacre_2013.htm">ZOMBIE
     MASSACRE</A></B> (2013) to understand this film because there is a self-contained
     story. During World War II, four American soldiers are behind German 
    lines, when Charlie Friedballs (really?; Michael Segal) steps on a 
    land mine and blows a leg off. They hide out in an abandoned building 
    while Doktor Mengele (Dan van Husen) says that they have perfected 
    the new human race and proclaims &quot;We are the hand of God!&quot; 
    The soldiers move Charlie to another secure building, where 
    Friedballs dies. The soldiers are being tracked by a squad of Nazis 
    who want to take the Americans alive. Matt O'Neill (Ally McClelland) 
    is sent out to find a transmitter and radio-in their coordinates for 
    back-up. Matt finds the radio transmission room, but it is full of 
    strange drawings, which spooks Matt as he heads out of the building. 
    Matt hears a strange moaning coming from another room and 
    discovers&nbsp; a bunch of zombies dressed in prison garb. Matt is 
    attacked and bitten after trying to stab one of the zombies over and 
    over with his knife&nbsp; and soon the American soldiers are 
    surrounded by zombies, They manage to kill them all by (naturally) 
    shooting them in the head, but Matt is slowly turning into a zombie 
    himself. To make matters worse, Charlie's body is missing and they 
    follow the trail of blood , finding Charlie's body eaten and a hole 
    in his head (probably self-inflicted, but don't count on it). It 
    seems the Americans have stumbled on a zombie prison and the Nazis 
    won't let them leave. It is an experiment to see how effective the 
    zombies are in warfare. James Calhoun (Aaron Stielstra) uses the 
    radio to try and get some help, but as soon as he gets an answer, he 
    is attacked by a zombie and cuts it in half with a hand ax. Matt 
    shoots himself in the head rather than become a zombie and James gets 
    blown up, so the only one left is Will Adams (Andrew Harwood Mills), 
    who begins hallucinating, smashes a zombie's head into a bloody pulp 
    with the butt of his rifle and meets an English-speaking woman named 
    Erin (Lucy Drive). Erin tells Will that those zombies aren't 
    &quot;things' but victims of&nbsp; Doktor Mengele's experiments. All 
    their humanity is wiped from their memories and all they want is 
    human flesh to eat. Erin says she escaped from Mengele's hospital and 
    agrees to take Will there. Even a zombie could see that Will is 
    walking into a trap. Erin takes Will to the hospital and he is 
    knocked out, He wakes up tied to a chair and meets Doktor Mengele, 
    who asks Will, &quot;Do you believe in God? I do. I found the secrets 
    of secrets. I discovered life after death!&quot; Mengele goes on to 
    explain that he has experimented on all races of people with no 
    success, but the only one that worked was when he operated on a crazy 
    Englishman. Mengele believes Will will be his perfect experimental 
    subject, since he is prone to hallucinations and Erin was just a 
    figment of his imagination (She was actually his mother!). It turns 
    out Will has killed all his American comrades and believes the Nazi's 
    did it. The film ends with Mengele experimenting on Will and he looks 
    just like he did before, only this time he is an indestructible 
    killing machine or as Mengele says, &quot;The Fourth Reich&quot;. 
    While a little more imaginable than I thought it was going to be, 
    this film still suffers from many (pardon the pun) dead spots. There 
    is plenty of gore, but most of it is shots to the head and very 
    little flesh-ripping. The zombie make-ups are good and so is the 
    cinematography. No shakey-cam here. Just straightforward 
    cinematography. This film may please some zombie fanatics, but it was 
    a little slow for my tastes, even at 84 minutes. Let me just say 
    this: The directors are improving from their previous efforts, but 
    not enough to get my seal of approval.; <B><A HREF="lady_psycho_killer_2015.htm">LADY
     PSYCHO KILLER</A></B> (2015) is a lousy, badly acted film about 
    virginal Ella (Kate Daly), who just started her first day in college. 
    One of her professors (Michael Madsen) assigns them this task: Break 
    a Sexual Norm. Ella decides to become the person of the title. She 
    first slits the throat of a strip club owner (portrayed by Ron 
    Jeremy, who gives the best performance in this film!) and then kills 
    her lecherous neighbor Gerald (Malcolm McDowell. What the hell is he 
    doing in a low-rent film like this?) by stabbing him in the stomach 
    with garden shears. Although bloody in spots, the constant narration 
    by Ella is a sign that the film was in trouble and it shows. It 
    doesn't help that Kate Daly is a bad actress. Boring with a capital 
    B.; <B><A HREF="six_gun_savior_2015.htm">SIX GUN SAVIOR</A></B> 
    (2015) is one of those rare breeds: A Horror Western. It starts out 
    good enough, but quickly falls apart, including a very rushed and 
    confusing <A HREF="six_gun_savior_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/six gun savior poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ending.
     The premise is this: At the end of the Civil War, the Devil (Eric 
    Roberts, who puts in a terrific performance) gives dead people the 
    chance to return to life, but only those with souls that are 
    undeclared (whatever that means), to get even with those who killed 
    them. Once they get their revenge, their souls become the property of 
    the Devil and they become human again, only they walk the Earth 
    soulless. We then see Confederate soldier Lane McCrea (Kaleo 
    Griffith), who has just been shot to death by family friend Grant 
    Dillon (Blaine Gray) making a deal with the Devil to return him and 
    his brother Cody (Adam LeClair), who was also killed by Dillon, back 
    to life to get even with Dillon. We then go five years into the 
    future, where Lane is still searching for Dillon, trying to stop his 
    brother, who is a real pain in the ass, from killing him first, 
    because he doesn't want to see him go to Hell. Dillon has been able 
    to keep a step ahead of them by enslaving female demon Zathera 
    (Lorraine Ziff), who can revive any dead person as a zombie to fight 
    Dillon's battles. You can tell they are zombies because no normal 
    bullet can stop them (the ammunition needs to be blessed by a priest 
    or an Indian medicine man) and they have glowing yellow eyes. They 
    also disintegrate when killed.&nbsp; Dillon is hoping to cheat the 
    Devil out of his soul, with the help of a demon called &quot;The 
    Mentor&quot; (Associate Producer Martin Kove, who looks like he is 
    having a good time), who escaped the Devil's domain and knows all the 
    tricks of the trade, trying to make Dillon the master of his own 
    domain. If it sounds confusing, it is, but, while the story is 
    disappointing, it is well acted and there are plenty of flying body 
    parts as Lane and his new group of demon fighters, including former 
    love Liz (Michelle Rose), Northern Army kid Hawk (Matthew Ziff) and 
    Indian squaw Muna (Maya Tremblay) kick demon ass and take names. 
    While this is a fast moving film full of plenty of fights and some 
    nasty gore, the film gets more unbelievable and insipid as it 
    progresses, with a really confusing finale, which seems to run 
    opposite of what we have been told through the rest of the film. It's 
    like feature film freshman director/screenwriter Kirk Murray painted 
    himself into a corner and ran out of valid ideas and tossed in the 
    finale to wrap things up. It ends like a sequel was being considered, 
    but it hasn't appeared yet. While not a total disaster, it is still a 
    bitter disappointment, since the backstory had a lot to offer the 
    viewer. You may like (or dislike) it more than I do, so be prepared. 
    The makeup effects (helped by noticeable CGI enhancements) are decent 
    and the violence bloody. This barely gets a passing grade from me, 
    but it is enough of a bad film for me to put it in this category.; <B><A HREF="western_religion_2015.htm">WESTERN
     RELIGION</A></B> (2015) is another Western with horror and fantasy 
    trappings, but it is a little too preachy for its own good, even if 
    it does have some interesting characters. Religion, Arizona is not 
    yet a full town, but Harvard Gold (James Anthony Cotton) hopes to 
    turn this tent city into a full-fledged town by holding a card 
    tournament and inviting some of the best, and most dangerous, card 
    players from across the World. The players include Salt Peter (Louie 
    Sabatasso), a gay Shakespeare-quoting morphine addict (!); Saint John 
    (Gary Kohn), a former preacher-turned-bounty hunter; Waylin Smith 
    (Miles Szanto), a carpenter who falls in love with Religion's head 
    whore, Bootstrap Bess (Holiday Hadley), who one day hopes to own and 
    run Religion's fancy grand hotel (if only she could find someone to 
    build it!); Chinaman Dan (Peter Shinkoda), an outlaw on the run; 
    Prince Zain Mohammed (Merik Tadros), a rich Arab prince who thinks he 
    is better than everyone else because of his wealth; and Anton Slice 
    (Claude Duhamel), a seeming indestructible gunman who may be the 
    Devil himself. Religion is a gun-free zone, so all the players must 
    turn their weapons over to Marshal Stone (Scott Donovan), the ad-hoc 
    lawman for the tournament. What follows next is a not-so-veiled 
    attempt to shove the Bible down the viewer's throat, as we have a 
    Last Supper sequence and other stories from the &quot;good book&quot; 
    told in Western clothing (The winner of the tournament receives a 
    crucifix made of solid gold). It all leads to a showdown with the 
    Devil and like the Bible, good wins over evil. Turns out you can 
    cheat the Devil. Director/screenwriter James O'Brien makes things 
    interesting during the beginning of the tournament by introducing us 
    to the rather large cast of characters, but when religion begins 
    seeping in to the story, I lost all interest. Why make a religious 
    Western? I can only guess it's because there really wasn't one 
    before. What surprised me about this film is, unlike religion, it 
    treats the gay character with some respect, even though he shoots 
    himself up with morphine every four hours and doesn't even try to 
    hide his habit. He actually turns out to be one of the heroes of the 
    film! That doesn't mean this is a good film, because it isn't. Though 
    well acted by a cast of TV veterans, the religious aspect of the film 
    will turn-off all those who aren't religious, like myself. I consider 
    this film a failure for that reason alone, although others may differ 
    in their opinions. Available free streaming on Amazon Prime (if you 
    are a Prime member). I have yet to see a Western made in the New 
    Millennium that I somewhat like, except for <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#StopOverInHell2016">STOP
