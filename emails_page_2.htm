        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">I have to say 
        sir it was a real treat for me to stumble upon your site. I am a 
        HUGE! fan of nostalgia video companies of the eighties and about a 
        week ago I was searching for a reputable site for more information on 
        the many companies that dominated that era and was fortunate enough 
        (by the little site we know as google) to find yours in a search. I 
        read every piece of info and am completely hooked. Thanks for the 
        site. I am twenty-four years old and really wished I was a little 
        older just to be able to enjoy every part of the eighties. The kids 
        today defiantly don't know what they missed. I was fortunate to have 
        a passion for the roots of both good and bad DTV's and movies in 
        general of that period. Anyway being a professional in this area for 
        many years do yo think with On-Demand today and the affordability of 
        making indi features that the crave of these kind of movies will 
        strike the hearts of people in today's generation? Or has everyone 
        turned to the 100 million dollar movie! Man I hate to be in the shoes 
        of one of the big studios in today's world because unlike twenty-five 
        years ago lets say, if you take a hit on a feature now it will blow 
        you out of your shoes a long way. Again thanks for the retro trip 
        memories and I will pass your site on even thou a lot of people I am 
        sure know who you and your site is. Take care!</FONT></FONT></B></P>

        That is why I created my web site. To keep the spirit of the 70's and

        about <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Media Home Ent.">Media Entertainment</A>:
         <I><FONT COLOR="BLUE">&quot;A lot of Media's early releases command 
        big bucks today in the auction market. I own a few from the late 70's 
        and they play perfectly. Just a side note here, but don't the early 
        tapes weigh much heavier than tapes produced in the last 10 years? 
        You could drop an older tape and nothing would happen. Drop a new 
        tape and be prepared to bring out the vacuum as it will shatter into 
        hundreds of small pieces. The older tapes were made to last, and 25 
        years later they play as well as the first time.&quot;</FONT></I></FONT></FONT></B><BR>
        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">I agree, it's 
        kinda weird that as VHS became a bigger industry that the VHS tapes 
        themselves became a whole lot more fragile. I used to work at a video 
        store a few years ago and by weight alone you could tell what was old 
        and what was new. A 1982 hour and half movie would weight about 5 lbs 
        and a 2002 three and half hour movie would only tip the scales at the 
        weight of a penny. We constantly had problems with the flap falling 
        off/cracking, the reel &quot;window&quot; (sorry, don't know what 
        you'd call it) cracks quite easily as well. I remember dropping many 
        an old VHS tape on our linoleum floors behind the counter and nary a 
        piece of plastic or spring would be out of place.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">By the way, I 
        just discovered your site by browsing Stomp Tokyo and I'm loving it. 
        I was born in '81, so by the time my parents were renting me videos 
        it was pretty much an old standby as far as I was concerned. I never 
        knew life without VHS, so it's kinda weird to think of d-grade horror 
        &amp; action movies renting wildy during those years. But I guess 
        when something's new, sometimes it isn't about quality... it's about 
        quantity (and the lack of). Now that I think about it though, that's 
        kinda the way things went when DVDs were first getting released.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

         decided to post this email as an example of the kind of inquiries I 
        get on a daily basis. Here are the facts: I do not and have not ever 
        sold anything on this web site. Everything on this site is from my 
        personal collection and I do not achieve any financial gain from my 
        reviews or anything else I post. There has never been, or will there 
        ever be, paid advertisements on this site. I have no problem 
        identifying films for people based on their memories, but once the 
        film is identified, it is up to that person to locate a copy. I do, 
        on occasion, trade films with people, but if I did it with everyone 
        who requested it, I wouldn't have time to breathe. If you have 
        requested trades from me (or copies of films I have reviewed) and 
        have not heard back, it's probably because I don't want to trade. 
        Don't take it personally, I'm just too busy to do so. - Editor</FONT></FONT></FONT></B><BR>

        Martin Kaderabek, I reside in Pr&iacute;bram, an old mining town in 
        the Czech Republic, in a two-story house that I share with my family, 
        several other tennants and several stacks of videocassettes and 
        digital versatile discs,&nbsp; and I would like to express my 
        appreciation for your site.&nbsp; It is truly a place where any 
        horror fan can find abundance of information concerning all kinds of 
        cinematic gems, oddities and things worth watching. Each review 
        contains valuable facts, references to other works of creators or 
        actors involved,&nbsp; information about&nbsp; various cuts and 
        versions of movies and about distributors. Your site can serve as a 
        source of knowledge and also as a guide for future generations of 
        those, who will at some point of their lives have to ask themselves: 
        &quot;Is this version of&nbsp; Nightmare in a Damaged Brain

        an image of&nbsp; poster or VHS cover of <A HREF="short reviews.htm#Hollow Gate">HOLLOWGATE</A> 
        in Polish language, and that image reminded me of those times shortly 
        after the &quot;velvet revolution&quot;, the early 90&#180;s, when 
        videocassettes with foreign movies became legally available in my 
        country. Almost all movies from City Lights were released around that 
        time, I used to pay visits to our local video rental shop as a boy 
        and bring home such titles as <A HREF="epitaph_1987.htm">EPITAPH</A>, <A HREF="newlydeads_1987.htm">THE

        productions. The system of&nbsp; rating was non existent at that 
        time, of course, kids wouldn&#180;t be allowed to rent&nbsp; adult 
        themed movies, but I was able to pick all those City Lights horrors 
        and actioners, flicks from Action International Pictures such as <A HREF="action part 2.htm#Night Wars">NIGHT
         WARS</A>, series of movies from New World Video, and even some Troma 
        movies&nbsp; that were released in our small, post-comunistic country 
        between 1990 and 1995. Today, the majority of Czech DVD distributors 
        tends to release only the newest productions and older horror flicks 
        and movies of all other genres made&nbsp; more than 5 years ago are 
        ignored. Sad, sad times. Every now and then, I have to smell the

         so much for the kind words. It's nice to know that my little site is

        lesson about VHS and DVD releases in your country. Sadly, your story 
        is no different than a lot of countries, including mine. It seems we 
        are getting less and less independent releases, as most companies are 
        happy releasing just the major films to DVD. Thankfully, there are 
        plenty of grey market sites on the internet where I can get all this 
        good stuff from the 70's and 80's. If those grey market sites ever

        add one thing I forgot to mention in the first message, and that is 
        the impression left by your visual history of video distribution 
        companies I personally find extremely well done. While browsing&nbsp; 
        that magnificent collection of colourful VHS covers, one idea came to 
        my mind. I have always been fascinated by variations in artworks for 
        one title distributed by different companies or in different 
        countries. Your site gave me the chance to compare the U.S. covers of 
        certain movies I am familiar with to the Czech versions. If it was of 
        any interest, I could scan some covers of videocassettes in my 
        library and send them by email just for the sake of comparation. I 
        noticed that some of the films released in Bohemia have the same 
        artworks as those used in the USA while others are the original 
        creations of our local distributors from 1990&#180;s, who apparently 
        didn&#180;t have the slightest idea what they were releasing (Fred 
        Olen Ray&#180;s HAUNTING FEAR&nbsp; released with title <A HREF="haunting_fear_czech_republic_vhs_cover.htm">HUNTING

        <BR>
        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">I recently came 
        across your website and found your video companies page.&nbsp; I must 
        say, it's amazing.&nbsp; One of my friends and I have been scrolling 
        through your galleries, excitedly pointing at box art we haven't seen 
        since childhood.&nbsp; You're absolutely right when you write about 
        kids today not being titillated by bizarre box art, and experiencing 
        all the mystery that creates and promises (although we've all been 
        burned by that match).&nbsp; That's gone now, with more subdued box 
        art and the internet available everywhere.&nbsp; I wanted to tell 
        you, &quot;excellent job.&quot;</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">I also had a 
        couple of films I was looking for; one of them I only remember the 
        box art.&nbsp; It featured muscle-bound twins who were barbarians 
        (before you say it, they were not the Barbarian Brothers).&nbsp; The 
        ones I remember were blond, and were fairly ugly men.&nbsp; I'm 
        pretty sure it was Italian.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">The other was 
        something I saw on late-night TV when I was in grade school.&nbsp; I 
        only saw part of one scene, in which an elderly wealthy man in a 
        lonely mansion shows his visitor his arm or hand, and from a small 
        wound, pulls out an ant or small insect.&nbsp; There was some dialog 
        in the scene in which the old man implies that this is some sort of 
        family curse.&nbsp; Beyond that, I've got nothing.&nbsp; The thought 
        of insects&nbsp; infesting your body freaked the shit out of me as a 
        kid (well, to be honest, it still does), and I've always wondered 
        what that was.&nbsp; Any idea?</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">While my friend 
        and I have nowhere near 6000 titles (holy shit! that's impressive), 
        we've got a good bit, and much of it is out of print.&nbsp; Is there 
        anything you're looking for?</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

        shot it in 16mm and supervised the 35mm blow-up at CFI in 
        Hollywood.&nbsp; By the way, Francis Ford Coppola sat in on part of 
        the color timing session. Also, the special features will be 
        numerous:&nbsp; all the screen tests of every actor we tested, over 
        50 I believe, a promotional fund raising 20 minute film I made to 
        show potential investors, a super-8 sound test film, a 30 minute TV 
        talk show on which I was the only guest, talking about 
        &quot;VENGEANCE&quot;, many behind the scenes photographs, an 
        introduction video explaining the history of the film, and a full 
        audio commentary with me and several of the cast members.&nbsp; I'm 
        hoping that this DVD set will be popular with film buffs of the 
        genre, but I'm really hoping it will help future potential 
        independent filmmakers like I was back then, and give them 
        encouragement to follow their dreams and make their movies.</B></FONT></FONT><BR>

        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">I just read 
        your review of <A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Strangers Paradise">STRANGERS
         IN PARADISE</A>. I first saw a clip of it on Public Access in 
        Pittsburgh, PA while I was in school. This weird goth guy named Buck 
        Darkhorn had a show called &quot;Buck the System&quot; (clever!). He 
        showed random clips or would drone on while words flashed on the 
        screen that said &quot;Shut up already!&quot; I remember seeing a 
        full Pigface concert and a topless girl dancing on a stump to the 
        song &quot;Heirate Mich&quot;. So, you get the kind of odd show this 
        is...especially public access.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">One night, he 
        played a montage of obscure films. One scene had the punk kids from 
        Strangers in Paradise walking down the street and a kid saying to his 
        parents, &quot;I wish I was back in Pittsburgh&quot;.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">After I saw 
        that scene, I had to buy the movie. I asked Buck what that clip was 
        from, so that's how I found out the title of the film. I soon after 
        somehow found the movie on VHS on ebay or something.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">When I finally 
        saw the entire film I couldn't believe how ridiculously funny it 
        was...so bad it was good. Most of the music in the movie is pretty 
        bad...although there are a few really interesting songs. Of course, 
        it falls tremendously short of Rocky Horror status. But, there is 
        something about it that should have made it a cult movie. There is 
        hardly any information about it online. I wonder even how the 
        director got money to make this film...</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">Anyway, I 
        appreciated seeing that more than two people have seen this awfully, 
        terribly, funny/bad movie.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

        you know who released the 1975 version of <A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Sudden Death">SUDDEN
         DEATH</A> starring Robert Conrad? I saw it crediting Richard Foreman 
        as the director. He must have shot some new footage. Eddy Romero 
        followed Oscar Williams 58 page script, which was too short. It came 
        out a little more than an hour. It wasn't a bad film, but had a 
        pretentious&nbsp; message. It was an early anti-CIA film. Test 
        marketed in Denver to lukewarm reception. Caruth C. Byrd's father did 
        not want to invest any more in distribution. I wondered who wound up 
        owning the film. I note Caruth C. Byrd died on December 16, 2010. He 
        is the albino in the <A HREF="sudden_death_photograph_1975.htm">photograph</A>.&nbsp;
         I shot stills for it, and know it was Eddie Romero. He must have 
        added scenes. I'm aware it was too short at just over an hour. Test 
        marketed in Denver to a tepid reception, The producer, Caruth C. 
        Byrd's father did not want to throw away good money after bad. I 
        wrote the website, but instead of answering me, it was taken down. I 
        was not pursuing legal action. I think it's a violation of the 
        director's code to work on a film without the original director's 
        permission even if the film stinks.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

        is Brian Coghill. I worked on the film <A HREF="action.htm#Slow Bullet">SLOW
         BULLET</A> in 1988. I was the weapons handler for the film. I also 
        was one of two SFX artists on the project. This was my first film, 
        pretty much right out of high school. I went on to work for Disney 
        and I am currently contracted by LucasFilm for various projects. I 
        can tell you first hand the making of SLOW BULLET was far worse than 
        actually sitting through it. I must of course admit I have never seen 
        the finished product. What we went through on the film crew (all four 
        of us) was akin to torture. The majority of the film was, as you 
        mentioned, filmed in Florida. It was actually filmed in Ft. 
        Lauderdale at the back lot of a production company that worked on the 
        movie FLIGHT OF THE NAVIGATOR as well as many others. One of these 
        days I will try to wrangle a copy of this gem and attempt to sit 
        through it. I just wanted to thank you for including it on your list. 
        It is quite hard to track down, and since we never received our pay 
        for the work, we can't hunt down the company either. I often tell my 
        friends and daughter about this film, and now I can show them someone

        is or is not same film as <A HREF="fantasy.htm#DevilWoman1973">DEVIL WOMAN</A>.
         I beleive it is for the following reasons which may prove helpful to 
        this riddle.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">I actually saw 
        BRUKA at the long defunct Cinema Theater in downtown Milwaukee. I saw 
        it in November 1980 on a triple bill with two other Asian grinders: 
        FORTRESS IN THE SUN and BAMBOO TRAP. I saw BRUKA again in summer 
        1983, do not recall the co-features but seem to think it was <A HREF="house_that_cried_murder_1973.htm">HOUSE
         THAT CRIED MURDER</A>. BRUKA was a popular item in Milwaukee 
        grindhouses in late '70s-early '80s, turning up every six months or 
        so, usually with other Asian films.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">Ok, here goes. 
        My young mind was so fascinated by these films that I have great 
        recall for these early ones. However, one I may have seen last month 
        I've already forgotten. it's the early ones that make the impression.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">BRUKA opens as 
        I recall with the closing scene from DEVIL WOMAN! It's the scene 
        where the the snake girl dies by falling off the cliff. An American 
        narrator says that this is the story of the snake girl and then the 
        scene of the girl by her parents' grave is shown as the we are told 
        that the girl will avenge these horrible deaths. I assume that the 
        scene of the girl falling off the cliff is supposed to allude to her 
        dead parents. Then a big red title card saying BRUKA, QUEEN OF EVIL 
        is inserted. This entire opening, which consists of various scenes 
        taken out of sequence from DEVIL WOMAN, runs about two minutes. The 
        rest of the film contains many of the scenes found in the BRUKA 
        trailer on youtube, but I do not recall the rock men. I do seem to 
        recall the snake lady with the long gray hair. I recall my father, 
        who would sometimes go with me to these things, telling me that this 
        was at least two or three different movies put together. That's how 
        confused we were!!! To complicate matters even more, I recall the 
        poster for the film hanging in the lobby and it's the exact same 
        poster that is on the Temple of Schlock website which is listed as 
        being the Filipino poster! This was actually the American poster as 
        well, and I recall it said a Hallmark presentation, which makes sense 
        since they distributed DEVIL WOMAN.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">All this said, 
        my theory is that they are the same film more or less. My guess is 
        that either the original producer or American distributor simply 
        chopped up DEVIL WOMAN and redited it into another film by changing 
        some the sequences and adding what appears to be additional footage 
        of midgets, rock men, etc., from possibly another film. BRUKA may 
        have been another film that was supposed to be shot together with 
        DEVIL WOMAN but was never finished beyond a few scenes, which were 
        then combined to make another film out of what was really just one.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">One thing that 
        may give insight into this whole mess was a conversation I had with 
        Belton Clark this summer, who used to head Ark Films, which was a 
        major distributor of low-brow kung fu in late '70s. He told me that 
        only two prints would be bought of these Asian releases. The American 
        distributor would then come up with a new title and send it back to 
        the Asian producer who would then cut a trailer and insert the new 
        title. All trailers and title changes were done in Hong Kong and then 
        sent back to American distributor. Often times title would be altered 
        again by American, but never inserted into film. I saw dozens of Ark 
        releases that simply just started with no credits, title, anything. 
        Only a newspaper ad would give title. One such example is a film 
        called AMSTERSAM CONNECTION which appeared also as BIG BAD BOLO, MEAN 
        KUNG FU KILLER, and who knows what else. I also suspect that Ark 
        would sometimes take a title from one film and put it on another 
        film, so that there would be two films with the same title moving 
        around the country, but at different times. In other words, they 
        would just switch film titles with each other!</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

         I have the film on the way, but it doesn't sound like the &quot;lava 
        monster&quot; film I've been searching for now decades. I watched 
        this film while growing up on a local affiliate station in Florida in 
        the early 80s. The film could be from the early 70s...MAYBE the late 
        60s, but I doubt it. From what I remember about the film since it's 
        been awhile and my memory of the film is slowly becoming fuzzier.</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1"><B>This starts out 
        as a couple are traveling in the woods somewhere. It looks like it 
        could have been somewhere in the Northwest United States. So, the 
        foliage is similar to Oregon or Washington State. They stop at a 
        secluded natural wood colored house that has a porch. I vaguely 
        remember that they could have been out of gas. They speak to this 
        man. He's either a sheriff or a supervisor or owner of the property. 
        I believe he tells them about the caves, but is very reluctant to 
        show them the caves claiming that it&#146;s just too dangerous. The 
        true reason was because his wife fell into the pool OR she was just 
        attacked by the creature. The couple came to take a look at lava 
        caves (I believe?) He takes them down a forest trail to the small 
        entrance that leads to a cave. He shows them the pool. It has a guard 
        rail next to the edge. I forget what happens to the man, but I 
        believe that he is killed by the owner of the property and then 
        thrown into the pool so the creature/lava can dispose of the body. I 
        believe that the woman resembles his wife or wants companionship, so 
        he wants her to stay with him. He keeps the woman trapped inside his 
        house. She eventually gets free and hides from him under the porch. 
        Once he enters the house, she makes a run for it down the road/trail, 
        but doesn&#146;t make it. Eventually, she makes her way back into the 
        cavern and the creature rises from the pool to kill the property 
        owner. This is the one single film I have yet to collect from my 
        childhood. I found</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1"> <A HREF="master_of_the_flying_guillotine_1975.htm">MASTER

        question for you.&nbsp; I saw this movie when I was a kid, I am now 
        32, it was more than 20 years ago when I saw it.&nbsp; By the way, 
        kudos on your site, it's kick ass!! Anyway, I can't remember much 
        about it other than this guy was some type of thief/ archaeologist 
        and he was recruited by some less than savory individuals to steal 
        this jewel from some temple out in the middle of from what I remember 
        to be similar to a middle east setting.&nbsp; He ends up saving some 
        woman who was not there of her own free will, by retrieving the other 
        jewel, of which he already had the other, and using them to cut the 
        baddies into pieces all while sacrificing his own self because the 
        power of the two jewels were too much for any man to wield.&nbsp; The 
        scene is very dramatic&nbsp; and shows his flesh being seared away by 
        the heat of the red jewel.&nbsp; The jewels were two colors (green 
        and red).&nbsp; One representing evil and the other good.&nbsp; I 
        hope that you can free my mid of it's early cable watching experience 
        trauma.&nbsp; I love movies, and have been engrossed ever since I saw 
        the cable box for my fist time in 1981.&nbsp; The beautiful bold 
        dazzling of the original&nbsp; HBO logo with the cool miniatures and 
        stars that went into lights.&nbsp; It all had a profound impact on 
        me, and watched so many of those low budget movies back then that I 
        did not even know the names of them. One that had plagued me until I 
        was about 18 was Sword and the Sorcerer, which by the way when I 
        finally bought it and watched it on DVD, I definitely realized why it 
        was only a hit with my childhood fascination with swords and not my 
        adult fascination with cinema.&nbsp; Although I must still give 
        myself props for liking things like Excalibur, the Deep&nbsp; and 
        Dune, movies which were way above my pay grade at 7 and 9 years old. 
        Any who, while typing this, I have had the epiphany of another movie, 
        which for the life of me, I cannot remember what it was called.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">I saw this 
        movie&nbsp; in the 80's also.&nbsp; The hero, once again a 
        sacrificial lamb, is a deep sea researcher or deep sea recovery 
        technician who is needed to assist an underwater touring expedition 
        that get stranded on an underwater ledge. He has his own little one 
        man submersible which he uses to first make contact with and then aid 
        in the rescuing of the party in distress.&nbsp; Upon holding up the 
        edge of the wrecked vehicle for the remaining rescue, he and his 
        &quot;little ship that could&quot;, are drug down to an abyss-y doom 
        to leave him celebrated as a hero.&nbsp; Any who, I am assuming it 
        was probably a late 70's/ early eighties movie due to the fact that 
        the hero was sporting a very manly full beard.&nbsp; Being that the 
        small time frame was the precipice of the beard, if safe to assume 
        that it was somewhere in there.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

        Where did you get all those images from? I know that you are probably 
        too busy to help me out, but I'll ask you anyways. Do you think that 
        you could identify a horror movie for me? I've never seen this

        <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="1">The box cover 
        art was some guy (I think he was a zombie) with blue skin. I think he 
        was wearing a suit and tie. I think that he had a moustache. His face 
        was not deformed or anything. He may have been busting out of a 
        television or swinging on a rope. I can't remember. This artwork was 
        drawn by an artist. The name of the movie might have had 
        &quot;zombie&quot; or &quot;dead&quot; in the title. This movie was 
        from the 1980's. It was a low budget, not very well known movie. This 
        movie may have been foreign, like from Italy. I'm sure that this 
        movie was put out by one of the video companies that you listed on 
        your website. If you know the name of this movie could you please 
        e-mail me back and let me know? I'd really appreciate it. Thanks

        back I managed to watch a sci-fi film on TV twice without catching 
        the title, it was terrible but it's been bugging me. I think it was 
        made in either the 80s or early 90s. There was a group of people on a 
        spaceship that was headed out to help a colony (I think), something 
        went wrong with the spaceship and the captain abandoned ship leaving 
        his crew to die. Back on Earth the captain was saying he was the only 
        survivor and talking about his heroic escape whilst his crew watch on 
        the news. They had to decide what to do as oxygen was low (or 
        something), the female second in command had a dog, there was a 
        wise-ass character, a knowledgeable engineer and a young female 
        cadet. Can't remember much more but I remember that the young female 
        cadet's head explodes when her space suit gets a rip in it whilst 
        repairing something outside the ship. Also the wise-ass guy watches 
        little virtual hula girls in his cabin, the second in command commits 
        suicide with her dog... eventually all that's left is the wise-ass 
        character who saves himself by getting into a cryogenic frozen coffin.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

         MAMBA</A> (1974), a film that was not shot seriously, but was used 
        by the late actor John Ashley and late Philippine American director, 
        George Rowe to get girls, (&quot;I'm going to put you in 
        pictures.&quot;). They saw something marketable after it was 
        finished, but was uneven. I tried to patch it up as well as I could, 
        difficult to do, because Alex David, also coincidentallly, a Chinese 
        producer, was so disgusted, he did not want to put up any more money. 
        I tried to get it from Dimension Films, but Larry Woolner had given a 
        small advance to John Ashley, who couldn't deliver the film. David 
        kept the negative in his office, chilling it in the daytime, then 
        baking it at night when the air conditioning was turned off. I had no 
        idea BLACK MAMBA was sold until I saw your review. He stiffed me my 
        10%. How did the print look after such maltreatment? Never mind 
        content, they were screwing around throughout the production. Is it 
        worth the US $ 20., or should I just flush the money down a toilet?</FONT></FONT></B></P>

        Chicago. I happened upon your website devoted to those old classic 
        video labels of the 80s; unfortunately I grew up in the ever-so dull 
        90s but I always journeyed to the local Mom and Pop video stores and 
        saw releases from Vestron, Wizard, Regal and the rest. I'm writing to 
        ask if you know anything about an obscure video company known as 
        Genesis Home Video; I know you are still working on the info on your 
        site but if you have anything about Genesis that you can tell I would 
        really appreciate it.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

        ask is because I have one of their rare VHS releases of a film called 
        ETHAN, an independent film made in 1964 by producer-director Michael 
        du Pont and starring Robert Sampson, who would later go on to play 
        Dean Halsey in RE-ANIMATOR (1985). I've been trying to find Michael 
        in hopes that he still has the rights to ETHAN and if he's interested 
        in getting it out on a good quality DVD, but so far no luck in 
        locating him yet. I have contacted two others involved: executive 
        producer Ferde Grofe Jr. and music composer Paul Glass, both of which 
        have been extremely cooperative in telling me anything they know 
        about the making of the film. I also hope to get in touch with Robert 
        Sampson as well, but so far my busy schedule has been getting in the 
        way. In the meantime, I've been trying to get Severin Films to look 
        into this film, but so far I haven't gotten any response yet. But if 
        you know anything about Genesis Home Video and how they got some of 
        their titles, I'm very interested to hear their story.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

        wondering if you might know the movie that I'm talking about? I'm 
        thinking it was called Dusk Till Dawn, Wait Till Dawn, or something 
        like that. It was a setting in the woods and some kids go to this 
        cabin and a huge (fat) maniac killer with an orange vest on kills the 
        kids and you find out later in the movie that there was also a twin 
        brother of his killing them as well because throughout the movie 
        you're like &quot;how can he be there too.&quot; He also has an 
        orange vest on. I know 1 scene is in an old log cabin schoolhouse or 
        church or something and then the one person runs across a rope 
        bridge, one person climbs up a tree and I think the killer has a 
        chainsaw. If you know this movie, do you know how I can get a copy of 
        it? Thank you!!!</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

        Sounds interesting. Anyway, I was wondering if you or anyone you know 
        has ever seen &quot;BLOOD CIRCUS&quot;, the movie made by Santo Gold, 
        the '80's fake gold pitchman? It was only released for a very, very 
        short while in Baltimore in the 80's and never released on video but 
        some people have seen it. I could only find a few reviews of it. And 
        I wonder if there's a copy of the negatives floating around 
        somewhere. The director, Santo Gold, is probably one of the most 
        interesting people in the world. Honest. I'm obsessed with him. 
        According to his website, he has a copy of the negatives for anybody 
        that wants to buy them. I really wish there's some really rich nerd 
        like me who will buy that and release it to the world. But Santo Gold 
        is a notorious bullshitter so who knows.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

         Bryan, your right about Santo Gold being an interesting person, but 
        I doubt we'll ever see a release of BLOOD CIRCUS any time soon. Mr. 
        Gold is notorious about protecting his name and &quot;reputation&quot;
         (He recently sued singer Santogold for copyright infringement and 
        she had to change her stage name to &quot;Santigold&quot;.), but he 
        keeps dangling BLOOD CIRCUS in everyone's face like a carrot to a 
        racehorse. I'm sure there's a print of the film around somewhere (I 
        keep hearing that there was a Beta tape master made of the print), 
        but Santo Gold is a huckster, a modern-day carnival barker, so don't 
        get your hopes up too high on ever seeing this film. Maybe when he 
        dies, his family will finally give it a release. - Editor</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

        Fred Olen Ray and Retromedia Enertainment Inc. for a&nbsp; very

        In addition and nothing to do with this legal matter, I also recall 
        That Fred Olen Ray attempted to fault you for printing what you are 
        in business to do. In journalism, opinions are one thing, statements

        something. He comes out of one room into another, a bedroom I think, 
        and a woman in a flowing nightie or dress is there. They know each 
        other. They both act all relieved that it is them. They begin to

        she breaks their kiss and moves we see from the camera POV her eyes 
        start to glow and her face transform into something hideous. He 
        notices not. She begins to do her thing. He seems OK at first. The 
        film gears into Slow-mo. The music turns dissonant, allietory. His 
        slow mo voice registers pain, his face looks tortured. We then see 
        the thing the woman has transformed into--some kind of demon or alien 
        with green glowing eyes, and 80 million rows of hideous, sharp, 
        teeth, covered in blood and gore, in some kind of special effect 
        grin--there isn't quite a face, more lie some kind of lines or 
        strings that connect whatever it is together. I don't know what it 
        was. The movie went to commercial break. I was--stunned, and 
        unnerved, and could watch no more. I returned the film but later 
        became curious as to what the heck I'd seen. Do you have any clues to 
        what it could be? It seemed to be late 80's up to 1995, the tech was

        across Critical Condition and was really taken aback by the number of 
        VHS covers you had to show!&nbsp; I was VHS junkie and spent a ton of 
        my paychecks renting and watching movies from the local video store 
        in my teens and 20s, and those pages brought back a lot of 
        memories!&nbsp; Thank you! However, they got me thinking about a film 
        I used to watch that I have yet to be able to locate, and I was 
        hoping you might recognize what I'm talking about.&nbsp; I do not 
        remember the name of the movie, or release date, or actors.&nbsp; All 
        I can recall is the VHS cover.&nbsp; It's an Italian film, dubbed in 
        English, and I could have sworn it was released by Prism 
        Entertainment.&nbsp; The cover was mostly white, with the appearance 
        of looking through Venetian blind I believe.&nbsp; All I remember is 
        the lead actress' character was in a loveless marriage, and she took 
        a trip where she had an affair with a young man with long blond hair, 
        and dressed him as a woman late in the movie to fool her 
        husband,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All I remember is I liked that movie a lot 
        for some reason, but that is all I remember. Does that cover or story 
        ring a bell?&nbsp; Any idea what I'm trying to find?&nbsp; I've been 
        perusing your huge catalog of covers, but have not seen it yet.&nbsp; 
        Any ideas?&nbsp; Your help would be greatly appreciated!</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

        tell you how great your site is. You really do your homework. I 
        especially enjoy your in-depth history of video companies in the 
        80's. I worked at Magnum Entertainment in 85 and 86, so I know 
        whereof I speak. I also did freelance work at Family Home 
        Entertainment/Monterey/USA Home Video (all owned by the same company) 
        in 1984, and I did freelance copywriting work at Warner Home Video in 
        1985. So I know that time and industry well. I was there during the 
        85 video explosion, and you got the details right. Excellent job. I'm 
        also a fan of 70's B-movies, and your reviews are great -- lots of 
        in-depth behind the scenes info along with thorough plot synopses. 
        I've also stumbled upon some films that I didn't know about. I'll 
        continue to explore your site, which is crammed with lots of great

        for my enjoyment of CritConOnline is the content on the history of 
        VHS. Being that I turn 30 this year, I was fortunate enough to 
        remember the good times. My father purchased a VHS player in 1985, 
        and he had us at Video Works and Mega Video and every other 
        mom-and-pop store at least once a week. Oh, how I remember being 5 
        years old and gazing at boxes for <A HREF="doctor_butcher_md_1980.htm">DOCTOR

        these days is the effect on the home video industry with the advents 
        of Blu-Ray and HD. I work in the industry myself as a TV producer, 
        and even so with all these technological advancements, which get 
        shoved down the throats of consumers and weasel their way into the 
        home video market, it truly signals, I think, a final and absolute 
        death for many of these older 
        haven't-been-released-since-early-VHS-days films. HD &amp; Blu-Ray 
        has determined the absolute need for quality masters for the home 
        market, and it's sad to think that <A HREF="witches_mountain_1971.htm">THE

        I absolutely love my super-compressed 1080i signal so that the HD 
        picture quality looks like a pixelated mess because the dish and 
        cable networks are cramming too much content through their lousy 
        not-up-to-snuff fiber optic and satellite interfaces. On the other 
        hand, Blu-Ray I have no problem with, but to kill the idea of 
        releasing <A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Redeemer 1976">CLASS REUNION MASSACRE</A>

        Actually, looking at prices of used content on Amazon.com and

        already there. So my message to your other readers would be, save 
        your VHS decks, and if you own any VHS tape that is in a box with a

        interactions with the video companies. I believe you've mentioned

         couldn't have said it better myself, Andrew. The advent of Hi Def 
        and Blu Ray has turned a lot of people into film snobs who are 
        worried more about the presentation of fims than the actual films 
        themselves. What concerns me more than these snobs are the DVD 
        releasing companies who try to cater to these snobs and forget that 
        there are people out here who would like to see the thousands of VHS 
        releases that have never had a DVD release to be given a fair chance. 
        I think we will never see that happen, though, because everything 
        today has to turn a profit. This is the reason why I continue to 
        review these films on this site. VHS will never die as long as 
        Critical Condition is around. As for the names of the artists who 
        drew all the garish VHS artwork that we know and love: I'm afraid 
        very little is known about them, but I am sure that someday we will 
        see a detailed article or book about them. They deserve recognition!
