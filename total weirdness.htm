    GHOST</A><A NAME="Alabamas Ghost"></A> (1972) -</B> When Alabama 
   (Christopher Brooks) accidentally drives a forklift through a wall in 
   the basement of San Francisco's famed Earthquake McGoon's nightclub, 
   he finds a hidden passageway that leads to a room that contains all 
   the possessions of &quot;World's Greatest Magician&quot; Carter The 
   Great (E. Kerrigan Prescott), who mysteriously died years before. 
   Alabama finds a box that contains the address of Granny (Ken 
   Granthan), Carter's &quot;sister&quot;. The box also contains some 
   magical herb (called &quot;raw zeta&quot;), which he and<A HREF="alabamas_ghost_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/alabamas ghost small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="124" HEIGHT="195" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Granny smoke in a pot pipe. Alabama is forced to team up with Zoerae 
   (Peggy Browne), Granny's assistant, as he wants to become a master 
   magician using Carter's found possessions. This leads Alabama on a 
   weird journey that includes vampires, robots, voodoo ceremonies, 
   ghosts, rock music, go-go dancers, a disappearing elephant, a biker 
   gang, a disembodied heart and the occasional drooling fanatic. 
   Alabama puts on magic shows at Earthquake McGoon's, billing himself 
   as &quot;Alabama, King Of The Cosmos&quot;, to packed houses. He is 
   picked-up by promoter Otto Max (Steven Kent Browne), who tells 
   Alabama, &quot;Surrealism is in. Surrealism is where it's at!&quot; 
   Otto books him on a tour across the United States, where he achieves 
   much acclaim. Things start going wrong for Alabama when one of his 
   female assistants is severely injured while he performs a sword trick 
   (she also has two puncture wounds on her neck). More accidents happen 
   which leads up to the grand finale: A world-wide televised showing of 
   Alabama doing Carter's &quot;disappearing elephant act&quot;, which 
   will have dire consequences on anyone who watches it. How it ends: 
   I'll never tell. I've barely scratched the surface on this 
   off-the-wall, rarely-seen supernatural thriller.

    BEACH PARTY MASSACRE</A><A NAME="AlienBeachPartyMass"></A> (1995) -</B> 
   When you see a film with a title like this, your expectations 
   automatically become lower than if you were to, say, watch the latest 
   Hollywood blockbuster or even one of The Asylum's latest 
   &quot;mockbusters&quot;. But, when you insert this tape into your VCR 
   and the first thing you see onscreen is &quot;A Gizz Film&quot;, you 
   just know that the last remaining brain cells will jump out of your 
   ears, making your cranium ready for the onslaught of awfulness that 
   is <B>ALIEN BEACH PARTY MASSACRE</B>. And what beautiful awfulness it 
   is. After an opening credits sequence with a slammin' 60's style 
   surfing instrumental (by The Insect Surfers, and you might as well 
   get familiar to the tune, because it's apparently the only song they 
   know how to play!), we are introduced to a race of friendly aliens as 
   they head through space in their ship (which looks like a 
   chopped-down model of the USS Enterprise from<A HREF="star_trek_the_next_ generation_tv_series_1987-1994.htm"> </A><B><A HREF="star_trek_the_next_ generation_tv_series_1987-1994.htm">STAR
    TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION</A></B> [1987 - 1994]), who are on their 
   way to Mirus 3 to deliver a prototype weapon called the Deathsphere. 
   Bumbling alien janitor Nagillig (George Willis; and, yes, his name is 
   &quot;Gilligan&quot; spelled backwards, so you know how bumbling he 
   really is. Somewhere, Bob Denver is spinning in his grave.) and the 
   rest of the crew watch a promotional video made by a nasty pig-nosed 
   alien race on the planet Ghastor that shows how to use the 
   Deathsphere (every<A HREF="alien_beach_party_massacre_1995.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/alien beach party massacre vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="176" HEIGHT="318" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   time the gadget's name is shown onscreen, it is followed by the &quot;Trademark</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">&quot;&#153;</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"> 
   symbol!), which turns out to be a weapon that kills all people but 
   leaves the planets intact. The friendly alien race (who speak in 
   high-pitched reverse English and chicken noises, which are subtitled 
   into English) are bringing the Deathsphere&#153; (which looks like a 
   common beach volleyball) to Mirus 3 to dismantle it, but idiot 
   Nagillig breaks the glass case it's stored in and the 
   Deathsphere&#153; falls to the floor, just as head Ghastorian bad 
   guy, Lord Odem (who is played by three different people, including 
   the director), catches up to them in his spaceship and fires 
   torpedos, damaging their ship and forcing them to crash on Earth, but 
   not before Nagillig puts the Deathsphere&#153; into a torpedo chamber 
   and ejects it, where it lands on the beach in a town full of jocks, 
   cheerleaders, drunks and potheads. Nagillig is the only one to 
   survive the crash, so he has to grab a tracking device (out of the 
   pants of a not-quite-yet-dead comrade, who has been cut in half by 
   the crash!) and find the Deathsphere&#153; before Lord Odem does. 
   Only Dr. Bateman (John Eineigl) knows that aliens have come to Earth, 
   so he jumps in his van to find proof, while dim-as-a-broken-lightbulb 
   Nagillig wanders around town, stealing a blind man's pencil cup and 
   being outfitted in awful beach gear by a huckster clothing store 
   owner. Hilarity ensues when Nagillig is mistaken for someone's cousin 
   from New Jersey (it must be his green skin!) and he joins hairy 
   pothead Glue (co-screenwriter Eric Zumbrunnen), jock Bud (Perry 
   Martin), cheerleader Babs (Stacey Havener), brainiac Robin (Kourtney 
   Kaye) and others for some fun on the beach, while Lord Odem and his 
   spiked leather-masked minion Number Two (who is played by two 
   different actors) mistaken a common beach volleyball for the 
   Deathsphere&#153; (Glue has the real one) and Dr. Bateman tries to 
   prove the existence of aliens.&nbsp; This is surprisingly funnier 
   than it has any right to be, if you watch it in the right frame of 
   mind, preferably buzzed on a case of beer or a few joints. Director 
   Andy Gizzarelli (the &quot;Gizz&quot; mentioned in the beginning of 
   the film and his only directorial effort), who wrote the joke-filled 
   script with co-star Eric Zumbrunnen and producer Mike Parente, keeps 
   the film moving at a brisk pace and even throws-in a few scenes of 
   bloody gore, mostly used for comical effect. While the cast is 
   strictly amateur hour (especially John Eineigl as Dr. Bateman), in 
   this film it actually works in its' favor. Zumbrunnen's character, 
   Glue (real name: Elmer, and, yes, I laughed when that tidbit was 
   revealed) has his long hair covering his face for 99% of his screen 
   time (even when he is toking on a bong or a joint) and he, along with 
   his two stoner friends, Jeff (Mark Fite) and Alan (Max Fisk), have 
   some of the best lines in the film. They're mostly all pot-related 
   (or influenced), but they're still funny nonetheless. I also like the 
   way the film switched gears from a beach party flick to a haunted 
   house thriller, as the entire cast go to the &quot;old Willoughby 
   place&quot; to smoke pot and have sex, only to be stalked by Lord 
   Odem and Number Two. There's a beheading (while Bud is getting head); 
   Bud is shot in the crotch with an alien crossbow device (Babs is shot 
   in the stomach with the same device); another girl has her arm cut 
   off (Jeff says to her, &quot;Linda, like don't worry, we know where 
   your arm is!&quot;); Dr. Bateman has his hand cut off (Glue says, 
   &quot;I hope that wasn't your stroking hand!&quot;) and then loses 
   other appendages in true Monty Python fashion; Jeff is impaled on the 
   fin of a surfboard; and other crazy nonsense (the bad aliens are 
   allergic to suntan lotion!), all done with tongue firmly planted in 
   cheek. While I know this isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea 
   (some people are going to hate this from the first frame) and the CGI 
   and green screen effects are crappy, this does have a crazy charm 
   that I found infectious. So sue me. Also starring Lisa Frankiel, Eric 
   Jacobson, Judi Alley and Tom Terri. A McCarter Multimedia Marketing 
   VHS Release (Yeah, I never heard of them either until I picked up 
   this tape!). Not available on DVD. <B>Not Rated</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

   (1986) -</B> Warning: If you have yet to view this strange and 
   manipulative horror movie (possibly the weirdest horror film made in 
   the 80's to get a wide theatrical release), please do not read this 
   review. This is a film that should be experienced for the first time 
   with no previous knowledge of what you are about to be put through, 
   because the narrative structure is quite unlike any film you've seen 
   before. The film opens with severely troubled John (Michael Lerner; <B><A HREF="strange_invaders_1984.htm">STRANGE
    INVADERS</A></B> [1983] and nominated for an Academy Award for his 
   role in <B><A HREF="barton_fink_1991.htm">BARTON FINK</A></B> 
   [1991]), a hospital orderly who is slowly going blind due to 
   diabetes. He is having trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy 
   thanks to his domineering mother (Zelda Rubinstein; best known for 
   her role in <B><A HREF="poltergeist_1982.htm">POLTERGEIST</A></B> 
   [1982], but she is absolutely unforgettable here), who hypnotizes him 
   on a daily basis. After his hypnosis sessions, John travels around in 
   a trance and removes people's eyes with a scalpel, bringing the orbs 
   to his mother as gifts. It's during one of these eye removal scenes 
   (about 22 minutes into the film) that we discover that what we are 
   actually viewing is nothing but a film (titled <B>THE MOMMY</B>) 
   being watched by an audience in a movie theate<A HREF="anguish_1986b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/anguish vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="268" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>r,
    but it seems like some audience members are also being affected by 
   Mommy's on-screen hypnosis methods (It's a sequence you won't soon 
   forget once you've viewed it). It seems to particularly affect one 
   male audience member (Angel Jove), who seems to take Mommy's 
   on-screen suggestions a little too seriously (subtle hints are 
   dropped that he has seen this film many time before in this same 
   theater) and begins murdering members of the audience, while John is 
   on-screen killing members of an audience in a theater showing the 
   1925 dinosaur film, <B><A HREF="lost_world_1925.htm">THE LOST WORLD</A></B>.
    As John begins decimating everyone in the theater on-screen, the 
   crazy male member in the real (?) theater begins shooting people with 
   a silencer-equipped pistol. One girl witnesses him killing the 
   ticket-taker and the candy counter girl and escapes the theater 
   (leaving her nervous female friend inside), but the killer then locks 
   the theater doors so no one can leave or get in. It's not long before 
   the fictional film on-screen and the actual killer's actions are 
   being played-out in-synch in a finale that is must be seen to be 
   fully appreciated. Just when you think it's over, it's not.&nbsp; The 
   best way to describe this film is that it fucks with your mind to the 
   point that you're not sure what is real and what is fiction, much 
   like what John is going through in the film-within-a-film. If I 
   weren't a rational human being, I'd swear that I was actually being 
   hypnotized while watching this. Director/screenwriter Bigas Luna (<B><A HREF="#Reborn">REBORN</A></B> 
   - 1981) masterfully makes us wonder if we are witnessing life 
   imitating art or art imitating life, purposely keeping the viewer 
   off-balance in a cacophony of sights and sounds that defy description 
   (once you see the sight of a snail riding on the back of a pigeon, 
   you'll swear that someone slipped you some hallucinogenics in your 
   soda!). <B><A HREF="anguish_1986b.htm">ANGUISH</A></B> is probably 
   one of the most original and overlooked horror films of the 80's; a 
   total masterwork of the macabre (A lot of reviewers compare this to <B><A HREF="he_knows_youre_alone_1980.htm">HE
    KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE</A></B> [1980] because of the film-within-a-film 
   opening, but the comparisons end there). The only way to fully 
   appreciate this unheralded classic of modern horror is in a packed 
   theater (man, that must have been cool, not to mention 
   goosebump-inducing!), but Anchor Bay Entertainment offers a nice 
   widescreen DVD that tries to duplicate the experience. I can't 
   recommend this film enough to fans of obscure horror. It plays with 
   your head in so many ways, you won't know whether you're coming or 
   going. Why isn't this film more popular? This is a one-of-a-kind trip 
   into the bizarre mind of a mad genius (Bigas Luna is like a demented 
   Spanish David Lynch, except his narrative structure is much easier to 
   follow), who would gain international arthouse fame with 1992's <B><A HREF="jamon_jamon_1991.htm">JAMON
    JAMON</A></B> (hey, even I like that one!). After viewing <B>REBORN</B> 
   and <B><A HREF="anguish.htm">ANGUISH</A></B>, I really wish that Mr. 
   Luna strayed to the dark side just one more time. Stay through the 
   end credits because it adds further depth to the experience. My 
   highest recommendation. Also starring Talia Paul and Clara Pastor.

    WITH FEAR</A><A NAME="AppointmentFear1985"></A> (1985) -</B> OK, 
   let's get this out of the way before I begin the review: Any film 
   that lists &quot;Alan Smithee&quot; as a director usually means the 
   film you are about to watch is going to be a total mess. I just 
   wasn't prepared for what was a weird mess this film was going to be. 
   We first spy chain-smoking Detective Kowalski (Douglas Rowe, who 
   looks like he stepped out of a 40's detective movie) staking out the 
   house of an unknown woman with a baby. When she leaves the house with 
   the baby, he follows her, but she is also being followed by an 
   unknown man (Garrick Dowhen) in a white van. Kowalski's car hits a 
   lady vagrant's shopping cart and he loses track of the woman, but the 
   man in the van is still following her. We then cut to Carol (Michele 
   Little), whose favorite pasttime seems to be spying on people's 
   conversations and taping them on audio cassette with a sound recorder 
   shaped like a small satellite dish (you know the kind; cop movies use them<A HREF="appointmant_with_fear_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/appointment with fear vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   all the time). She watches as the unknown woman stops at a house 
   nearby and turns her listening device towards her, when the unknown 
   man (who never utters a single word though the entire film) sits by 
   her side and she says, &quot;You can't kill the baby. It's your baby. 
   You can't kill him!&quot;, and then he plunges a knife in the woman's 
   side and leaves. Neighbor Heather (Kerry Remsen, who for some unknown 
   reason wears bright blue makeup covering her eyes, upper nose and 
   lower forehead, like a neon mask, throughout most of the film) goes 
   to the dying lady, who gives her the baby (Heather lost her four 
   year-old brother a couple of years ago in a bathtub drowning when she 
   didn't keep an eye on him and was talking on the phone) and tells her 
   to not let the man get him. The man, we soon find out, is known as 
   Attis, King Of The Woods (!), who Detective Kowalski put in a coma 
   years before&nbsp; and believes he can leave his body to kill babies. 
   You see, Attis needs to kill one baby a year to remain King Of The 
   Forest (Don't try questioning it, just go along with it. Believe me, 
   your brain will thank me later.) Kowalski visits Attis in the 
   hospital on a regular basis (the room is nothing but a bed and a few 
   electronic doo-dads) and tries to convince Detective Connors (the 
   late James Avery in a needless role) that Attis is able to leave his 
   body and appear at will anywhere, but Connors looks at Kowalski like 
   he is crazy. Meanwhile, Heather (and the baby), Carol and a couple of 
   her female friends spend a weekend at the house of Carol's's mother's 
   newest boyfriend (the house looks like it was designed by someone 
   high on LSD!) and, yes, you guessed it, Attis shows up and begins 
   dispatching some of the girls to get to the baby. It turns out that 
   Carol is a crack shot with automatic weapons (which her mother's 
   boyfriend keeps out in the open!) and she pumps bullet after bullet 
   into Attis' body, with no effect. It takes Heather to stab him with 
   the silver tip of a flag pole (!) to finally kill Attis, as we see 
   his body explode in his hospital room. Now, if any of this sounds 
   interesting, I apologize, because it has to be the weirdest scripted 
   film in recent memory. The screenplay, by Gideon Davis and Bruce 
   Meade, is full of head-scratching dialogue and everyone speaks like 
   they just stepped out of an issue of Psychology Today. Everyone talks 
   like they just took a class on existentialism and there are other 
   head-scratching elements in the film, too, like why would Carol let 
   bum Norman (Danny Dayton) live in the back of her pickup truck? None 
   of it makes much sense, such as when Detective Kowalski describes to 
   Attis a dream he had involving a red pigeon by a clock, who gets 
   eaten by a bat who gets impaled by the hands of the clock! I mean, 
   what the fuck?!? Director &quot;Alan Smithee&quot; is actually Ramsey 
   (Ramzi) Thomas, who never went on to direct another film again 
   (surprise!), but he has worked in various capacities on other films, 
   such as Producer on <B><A HREF="halloween_5_1989.htm">HALLOWEEN 5: 
   THE REVENGE OF MICHAEL MYERS</A></B> (1989), that was Executive 
   Produced by Moustapha Akkad, who also produced this film. I haven't 
   even scratched the absurdities in this film, like why does Bobby 
   (Michael Wyle) ride a motorcycle with a female dummy in his sidecar 
   or how does a group of dancers (direct from Denny Terrio's studio) 
   suddenly appear in the driveway of the house and why does boyfriend 
   Cowboy (Vincent Barbour) join-in on the dance? While there is some 
   fleeting nudity on view, those looking for a gore-drenched slasher 
   film are going to be very disappointed because the camera cuts away 
   just as the killings get good (like Norman's decapitation) and there 
   is much too little blood on screen to make it worth a slasher film 
   fanatics list of must-see films. I will give it this: It is weird 
   beyond belief and feels like it was filmed is some sort of alternate 
   universe. If that turns you on, you may dig this film. All others 
   beware. It was edited by Herbert L. Strock (who must have had a hard 
   time making sense of the mess that was put in front of him), who 
   earlier directed such classic badfilms like <B><A HREF="how_to_make_a_monster_1958.htm">HOW
    TO MAKE A MONSTER</A></B> (1958) and <B><A HREF="crawling_hand_1963.htm">THE

   (real life open heart surgery footage is shown when they open up 
   Waldemar's chest and remove a silver bullet from his heart, put there 
   by a woman who once loved him. Legend states that a werewolf can only 
   be permanently killed if a woman who loves him shoots him in the 
   heart with a silver bullet. This bit of knowledge will come in handy 
   later in the film). Waldemar, who is given an injection to stop him 
   from turning into a werewolf, turns into a werewolf anyway at the 
   next full moon (one of several sloppy scenes in this film) and 
   escapes from the abandoned monestery where the aliens are hiding out, 
   nearly killing young woman Ilsa (Patty Shepard; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#RestInPieces1987">REST

   In a coincidence that is beyond believable (approaching

   tells Henry about the incident, believing every word that comes out 
   of his mouth (any normal police detective would have looked at the

    Now here's where the unbelievable part of the film starts. Maleva 
   falls in love with Waldemar and Ilona falls in love with the Count, 
   their strong female feeling for them making it next to impossible for 
   Dr. Varnoff to control the monsters. The one monster he is able to 
   control is the Farancksalan Monster (say the name slowly), who walks 
   around slowly with his eyes closed, yet he is able to unlock doors, 
   flip switches and nearly kills Waldemar and the Count, but fails. 
   This all leads to the eventual monster bash, where Waldemar battles 
   the Farancksalan Monster and the Mummy, defeating them and eventually 
   battling the Count. Dr. Varnoff, meanwhile, torture Ilona for her 
   treachery by shocking her with electricity, telling Maleva, &quot;This
    is not punishment&quot; (Then what in the hell is it?!?). Waldemar 
   is then killed by Maleva, for reasons mentioned earlier in this 
   review. The monsters never do get the chance to scare humanity to 
   death because of stupid human female emotions. Take that you scumbag aliens!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This cheap film, directed by Tulio Demicheli (<B><A HREF="action.htm#Mean Machine">RICCO
    THE MEAN MACHINE</A></B> - 1973), is a bottom of the barrel horror 
   show for so many reasons, I fail to understand why it has fans. The 
   reasons why we never hear the names Dracula or Frankenstein is 
   because the production was too cheap to pay the licensing fees, even 
   though the film was retitled <B><A HREF="dracula_vs_frankenstein_1969.htm">DRACULA

    VS. FRANKENSTEIN</A></B> (1971) appeared in theaters. Just as in 
   Adamson's film, the monsters here are pathetic, eliciting laughs 
   instead of screams. The Count wears the worst pair of fangs I have 
   ever seen on a vampire (even those store-bought plastic fangs look 
   more believable) and the Faracksalan Monster's makeup is so bad (you 
   can see where they glued on the headpiece, disguising the seam as

   your head in disbelief. The Mummy is so thin (and he looks Asian!), 
   he would probably fall through a crack in the floor. Even the 
   werewolf makeup Paul Naschy (who also wrote this film, using his full 
   given name Jacinto Molina Alvarez) wears is subpar, looking dimestore 
   in appearance when compared to the rest of his werewolf films. Add 
   all that to absolutely no nudity or graphic violence and what you end 
   up with is a horror film lacking horror. Purists consider this the 
   second Daninsky werewolf film (following <B><A HREF="frankensteins_bloody_terror_1968.htm">FRANKENSTEIN'S
    BLOODY TERROR</A></B> a.k.a <B><A HREF="mark_of_the_wolfman_1968.htm">MARK

   [1968], with <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Werewolf Shadow">WEREWOLF SHADOW</A></B> 
   [1970] coming after it), but this is the only Daninsky film that has 
   Naschy as a secondary character, spending more time on the other 
   monsters and Dr. Varnoff's activities. Director Dimicheli tries to 
   get our minds off the fact that this film is so cheap by throwing in 
   some comedy, but it falls flat and makes no sense, such as the scene 
   where the Inspector gets drunk and then sees himself turning into the 
   Count in a mirror. A mirror? C'mon on now! At least know your vampire 
   lore before trying something cheap like this. Unfortunately, also 
   adding to the film's badness is the print itself. I tried to find an 
   uncut widescreen print, but they are harder to find than a 
   leprechaun's gold. I searched high and low for the German DVD which 
   is in widescreen and uncut (and English subtitled), but I could not 
   find it for a decent price (some stores want $50.00 just for the 
   postage alone!). I got stuck with the abysmal 77-minute TV print 
   (distributed by American International Television), which is missing 
   more than a few frames, cutting out some important dialogue where Dr. 
   Varnoff describes to his race why it is so important to revive these 
   monsters (He even mentions a Golem, but the film was too cheap to 
   show us one). This print was used for nearly all the VHS (from labels 
   such as <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Budget Labels">United 
   American Video</A> and Sinister Cinema) and DVD releases of the film 
   since it is in the Public Domain (PD), just like many of Naschy's 
   other Waldamar Daninsky films. My review might have been a little 
   more positive if I had a good print to watch, but seeing these 
   monster makeups more clearly wouldn't help my opinion. The English 
   dubbing is also horrendous. It is obvious many of the actors here are 
   speaking English, yet the dubbers offer no emotional range in the 
   characters, making their line readings one-note and monotonous. This 
   is also the final film of Michael Rennie's storied career, making his 
   mark in 1951's <B><A HREF="day_the_earth_stood_still_1951.htm">THE 
   DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL</A></B> as the alien Klaatu. I'd like to 
   think that Rennie didn't dub his own voice here because the budget 
   couldn't afford it, but it was probaly because he knew what a stinker 
   this film was. Code Red announced an uncut Blu-Ray back in 2017, but 
   it hasn't yet been released (at the time of this review). Also known

   wonders why they are the first people to live in this house for a

   different from one another and wonders if the house is more than a 
   hundred-years-old. Marc says not necessarily, houses of this type 
   (sort of an Art Deco style) were also built in the 1930s, telling 
   Sophie, &quot;At that time, people were dancing the Fox Trot in 
   houses like this one.&quot; Sophie has a very close relationship with 
   her father and gets visibly jealous when he pays attention to her

    Once inside, we see Fran&ccedil;oise is about to paint the kitchen,

   Fran&ccedil;oise says no, they can't afford it on Marc's salary and 
   maybe she should go back to writing, her former profession 
   (Fran&ccedil;oise taunts Marc about his job and seems to enjoy it a 
   little too much). Suddenly a paint can tips over on its own and 
   spills all over the floor. Fran&ccedil;oise thinks Marc was being 
   clumsy, but he says he had nothing to do with it and walks out of the 
   kitchen, leaving Fran&ccedil;oise to clean up the paint-covered 
   floor. Sophie, who was laughing after seeing the paint can tip over, 
   asks her mother if she needs any help, but she tells Sophie to keep 
   an eye on her brother, who is outside playing war with his vast 
   collection of miniature leads soldiers. Sophie, who is holding a 
   rotting piece of rope and tying knots in it, passes by Dominique and 
   doesn't pay any attention to him, rather picking up <A HREF="expulsion_of_the_devil_1973.htm#SnailMating">two

   everyone comes running, the little boy pointing to his lead soldiers, 
   which lie on the ground, all of them broken, like they have been 
   stepped on. Dominique says, &quot;They did it!&quot;, meaning the 
   soldiers did this on their own. This is just the beginning of the 
   weird happenings in and around the mysterious house, as this family 
   of four will soon discover.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    That night, Dominique screams from his bed after having a nightmare, 
   begging his parents to sleep with them tonight. They decide to put 
   him in Sophie's room instead, Sophie objecting loudly, saying it's an 
   invasion of her privacy and telling her parents, &quot;I don't like 
   to hear him breathe!&quot; Sophie waits a little while, walks outside 
   and spots her father opening his bedroom window. She then decides to 
   teach her parents a lesson about privacy (or she is possessed by the 
   house) by flinging open their bedroom door, just as Dad was about to 
   get it on with Mom. A silent Sophie then walks out of the room, with 
   Marc following and yelling at Sophie about his and her mother's 
   privacy, but before he can make his point, rocks come flying through 
   nearly every upstairs window in the house and it becomes a 
   slow-motion scene of shattering glass flying through the air with 
   rocks hitting the walls with a loud &quot;thump&quot; (it's a great 
   atmospheric sequence). The next morning, thinking it was a gang of 
   punks welcoming them to their new home, Marc and Fran&ccedil;oise 
   have all the broken windows replaced and are having drinks on the 
   outside pation, when, suddenly, the round patio table flies through

   when all the appliances, including the dishwasher and refrigerator, 
   begin attacking Henri, trying to crush him. Marc and Fran&ccedil;oise,
    who are outside with their children, beg Henri to come outside, 
   forcing Henri to jump out of one of the kitchen windows to escape the 
   approaching appliances. Henri ends up in the hospital with 
   lacerations all over his body, two broken ribs and a possible 
   fractured skull. At the hospital, Marc tells his friend Perou 
   (Jean-Pierre Darras), a TV producer of a news show, what is happening 
   at his house, so Perou asks Marc if he can send a small crew to his 
   house to document the strange happenings there, saying it would be 
   perfect for his show. Marc agrees, because he, Fran&ccedil;oise, 
   Sophie and Dominique don't plan on going back to the house any time 
   soon, as they will be staying at Sophie's grandmother's house until 
   they can find out what is going on in that house (Finally, a family 
   with common sense! How many times have we seen the opposite happen?). 
   We are then introduced to Perou's three-man crew: cameraman Leroy 
   (Michel Creton), lighting technician&nbsp; Kleber (Andr&eacute; 
   Weber) and sound man Beretti (a rail-thin G&eacute;rard Depardieu in 
   one of his early roles). They fit the house with lights, microphones 
   and cameras to catch the strange happenings supposedly taking place 
   there, but are disappointed when nothing weird happens. That is until 
   Sophie makes a surprise appearance, telling Perou that she hitch-hiked
    from her grandmother's house because she missed &quot;her&quot; 
   house. While Perou phones Marc, telling him not to worry, Sophie is 
   at the house, Beretti, who is cooking dinner, sticks his hand in a 
   boiling pot of water and screams in pain. Sophie bandages his hand, 
   but Beretti has no recollection of putting his hand in the boiling 
   water. An ear-piercing noise then emits from inside the house, 
   causing everyone, except for Sophie, to cover their ears with their 
   hands, as it is causing severe pain. As Perou opens the front door 
   for him and his crew to run outside, the noise suddenly stops, as

   Father D'Aval runs the local female orphanage and apologizes for the

   be considered weird&nbsp; and somewhat leisurely, they are much more 
   story-driven and linear in their story-telling. Juan worked just as 
   much in television as he did in feature films but there is no denying 
   that this film, as well as his semi-horror film <B><A HREF="leonor_1975.htm">LEONOR</A></B> 
   (1975), have a visual and emotional impact that would make his father 
   proud. When this film ended, I smiled just as much as Sophie, because 
   it just clicked with me and left me emotionally satisfied, even 
   though we never know just what is haunting this house. We don't 
   really need to, because this film is different from most haunted 
   house horror films, as we are involved with the characters, not just 
   what is happening in and around the house. I can't say this will have 
   the same emotional impact for you, but patient viewers will recognize 
   a classic when they see one. It is obvious that films such as <B><A HREF="poltergeist_1982.htm">POLTERGEIST</A></B>

   perfection and should be more widely known and appreciated.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   shelter, especially since one member of their party, Mr. Bruin 
   (Robert Firgelewski, the film's not-so-special effects coordinator), 
   is seriously injured. They put Mr. Bruin in the shade and search for 
   water, with the one dissenter in the group (there's always at least 
   one), Mr. Morgan (John Vichiola), complaining that Mr. Bruin is as 
   good as dead and they should all be worried about their (by 
   &quot;their&quot;, he means &quot;his&quot;) well-being. Leaving Mr.

    TREK</A></B> universe, they would be known as &quot;redshirts&quot;),
    head inland to look for water, food and shelter. What they find 
   instead is an island of horrors. While everyone id picking berries 
   and commiserating about their bad luck and personal problems, one of 
   the unnamed passengers comes upon a stream and takes a drink, only to 
   discover too late that the water is actually acid and he lets out a 
   blood-curdling scream as the flesh peels away from his body (it's 
   probably the film's best makeup effect). The rest of the survivors 
   decide to be more careful (no shit), but they will soon discover that 
   the island is crawling with a tribe of miniature doll-like creatures 
   with razor-sharp teeth (their resemblance to the Zuni fetish doll in <B><A HREF="trilogy_of_terror_1975.htm">TRILOGY
    OF TERROR</A></B> [1974] is uncanny) and they like the taste of 
   human flesh. The toothsome little buggers make their presence known 
   when John and Quinn go to retrieve Mr. Bruin down at the shore and 
   discover that he has been picked clean (all that is left is his 
   skeleton). John and Quinn keep their discovery a secret from the rest 
   of the survivors (Mr. Bruin simply died from his wounds), but it's a 
   secret that doesn't last for long. Their first night on the island, 
   everyone is attacked by the creatures while they are sleeping around 
   a campfire, as the little demons run on the ground or swing on vines 
   and begin biting everyone. Luckily, no one is killed, but everyone is 
   badly cut-up from the tiny terrors' teeth. Since the little demons 
   have set their lifeboat adrift, the survivors are continuously 
   attacked and killed one-by-one (Mr. Morgan seems to have caught 
   rabies from a bite, as he foams from the mouth and decides to take an 
   acid bath!). Will anyone survive this onslaught?&nbsp; Long a

   1985 and also known as <B><A HREF="hell_island_1983.htm">HELL ISLAND</A></B>)
    contains all the trademarks of a truly awful film: Terrible acting 
   by a cast on non-pros (some of the emoting here is wince-inducing); 
   special effects that are anything but special; a droning synthesizer 
   score (by John P. Mozzi); and technical issues (include poorly 
   recorded sound) that are inherent in films with budgets less than 
   your cousin Schlomo's bar-mitzvah. Yet with all these faults, 
   director/co-producer Michael Stanley (a still-active theater director 
   in Connecticut whose only other film credit is directing <B><A HREF="doing_agatha_2008.htm">DOING
    AGATHA</A></B> in 2008) and screenwriter Robert A. Hutton manage to 
   turn in a film that is utterly infectious in its badness. The attacks 
   by the tiny tribe of whatever-they-are (they have painted-on bright 
   white eyes that glow in the dark and little black mullets) are 
   priceless, as it is plain to see that they are as animated as a block 
   of wood (the only parts that seem to move are their mouths and their 
   arms at their shoulders), yet they run as fast as lightning (with 
   their little arms swinging back and forth), swing from vines and fly 
   through the air. The attack scenes are simply incredible, as it is 
   obvious that crew members just out of camera range are throwing the 
   dolls at the actors, but the film is so damn bloody (including a 
   nasty tree branch impalement and plenty of flesh eating), you can't 
   help but be impressed. Even more mind-blowing is the scene where all 
   the dolls gather at a giant wooden totem of themselves and pray 
   (Cathy says, &quot;There must be hundreds of them!&quot;, but we see 
   no more than twenty!). For those who have never witnessed this film, 
   it's about time that you did. For those who have seen it, it's time 
   for a revisit. A totally weird viewing experience all the way. Also 
   starring Frans Kal, Ronald A. Haupler Jr. and Joanne Stanley.

   we are privy to a conversation at a mod party, where several people 
   are having a conversation on how comic strips can be 
   &quot;revolutionary&quot;, a man answering, &quot;Of course. Even 
   Snoopy in his own way is anti-establishment.&quot; Valentina 
   (Isabelle De Funes) then arrives at the party on a motorcycle driven 
   by Sandro (Sergio Masieri), saying what a wild ride she just had. 
   Valentina is a world famous photographer/fashion model, who goes by 
   the name &quot;Cartier-Bresson&quot;, her specialty photographing 
   images that deal with publicity, fashion, art, politics and news (in 
   other words, everything). Also at the party is filmmaker Arno Treves 
   (George Eastman; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Anthropophagus1980">ANTHROPOPHAGUS</A></B> 
   - 1980), who tries to explain to Valentina and Guido (Giorgio 
   Pellizone) how hard it is to make a movie with no money. Guido gives 
   Valentina a ride home in his sports car, as long as if she doesn't 
   mind sitting on Arno's lap. Halfway to home, Valentina tells Guido to 
   stop the car, she'll walk the rest of the way. Arno tags along, 
   trying to get her back into the car because it is 3:00 in the 
   morning. &quot;That's the nicest time of the day&quot; is Valentina's 
   reply, as she continues walking, Arno following her. &quot;I don't 
   feel like making love to you...tonight.&quot; Valentina says to Arno, 
   so he gets back in the car, Guido driving off. Valentina saves a dog 
   from being run over in a car driven by a mysterious woman (Carroll

   - 1972) and she barely escapes with her own life. The woman stops the 
   car and apologizes to Valentina, insisting she drive her home and 
   &quot;I won't take no for an answer.&quot; Valentina gets in her car, 
   where the woman tells her that their meeting was preordained, because 
   she knew something was about to happen. She drives Valentina to her 
   door and Valentina wants to know how she knew where she lived, the 
   woman answering, &quot;There are many things that you'll want to 
   know, my dear, but not now.&quot; The woman continues to say that 
   maybe later she will explain, but first she needs a personal item 
   from her, reaching under Valentina's miniskirt and taking a clasp 
   from her garter belt that held up her stockings, saying, &quot;Be 
   assured that I will return it to you tomorrow.&quot; Valentina gets 
   out of the car totally confused. Who is this woman and why does she 
   speak in riddles? As Valentina gets to her door, the woman says to 
   her, &quot;Don't forget my name. My name is Baba Yaga!&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>

    That night, Valentina has a strange nightmare where men in Nazi 
   uniforms escort Valentina outside wearing nothing but her bra and 
   panties. A Nazi holding a cat makes her remove what little clothes 
   she has on and has her jump into a bottomless hole in the ground (it 
   looks like a grave). Valentina wakes up when she jumps, breathing 
   deeply (this won't be the only time she has to deal with a bottomless 
   pit). Her doorbell rings and it is her friend, model Toni (Angela 
   Covella). Toni tells her it's not morning, it is actually the 
   afternoon, so Valentina does a fashion photo shoot of Toni (dressed 
   and undressed in a wide variety of costumes) with her favorite 
   camera. In the middle of the shoot Valentina hears her doorbell ring 
   and it's Baba Yaga. Valentina invites her in as Toni leaves. Baba 
   Yaga returns the clasp that she took from Valentina and tries to put 
   it back on Valentina's body. Valentina tells her that she is not 
   wearing a garter belt and Baba says that's a pity. Valentina wants to 
   know who arranged their &quot;preordained&quot; meeting, Baba saying, 
   &quot;There are forces which control our actions and our 
   feelings.&quot;&nbsp; Valentina asks &quot;What forces?&quot;, Baba 
   answering, &quot;It's too soon Valentina. It is too soon.&quot; Baba 
   admires Valentina's favorite camera, rubbing her fingers over the 
   camera and saying, &quot;That is the eye. The eye that freezes 
   reality.&quot; (I've never looked at a camera that way, but she makes 
   a good point if you think about it.). Valentina is confused by all 
   the riddles and Baba says she must leave, but Valentina must come to 
   her house (It is said more like an order than an invitation), telling 
   her it is an old house, leaving her address before she leaves. 
   Valentina tells Baba that she will definitely come to visit her, but 
   Baba Yaga may have put a curse on Valentina's favorite camera.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Valentina is mystified by Baba Yaga and she can't get Baba out of 
   her mind. Arno phones her, inviting Valentina to come to the location 
   he is shooting footage for his latest film. When she gets there, she 
   sees Arno catching a rat in a butterfly net, using the rat for some 
   footage, but his movie camera jams and the rat gets away (When 
   Valentina asks Arno what he would do with the close-up footage of the 
   rat, he replies that maybe he will show it next to a photo of some 
   big industrialist! They then get into a discussion about censorship 
   and how Arno is selling out.). They go back to her apartment, not 
   noticing that Baba is watching them from across the street. Arno 
   looks at Valentina's portfolio, gets turned-on and they make love. 
   The next morning, Toni enters Valentina's apartment and scares the 
   crap out of Arno, yet he stays to watch the photo shoot. When 
   Valentina snaps away with her favorite camera, Toni collapses, 
   falling to the floor, telling Valentina that she suddenly feels sick. 
   Arno calls a taxi for Toni and goes with her to make sure she is 
   safe. This is when the film really goes off the rails. Whenever 
   Valentina points her favorite camera at a subject and clicks away, 
   something bad happens to the subject.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Valentina visits Baba in her old home, asking her if she would mind 
   if she did a jewelry photo shoot there. Baba doesn't mind and 
   encourages Valentina to go upstairs, telling her that there are many 
   things there for her to photograph. Valentina goes upstairs and finds 
   many antiques to photograph, but one object really gets her 
   attention. It is a child's doll, naked except for some S&amp;M gear 
   it is wearing. Valentina is fascinated with it, taking photos of it 
   until her camera runs out of film. She then finds a black glove and 
   puts it on, something stirring inside her. She begins masturbating 
   until Baba wakes her from her trance. She gives Valentina the doll, 
   telling her the doll's name is &quot;Annette&quot; and &quot;You must 
   always have her with you. She will protect you from any harm.&quot; 
   Valentina tells her she needs no protection, as no one has threatened 
   her, Baba replying, &quot;You never know. You never know.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Valentina goes home and begins developing the photos she just took, 
   discovering Annette is not in S&amp;M gear, but a dress. Is her mind 
   influencing her sight? When Valentina takes a photo of a hippie named 
   Carlo (Mario M. Giorgetti; <B><A HREF="teenage_prostitution_racket_1975.htm">THE
    TEENAGE PROSTITUTION RACKET</A></B> - 1975), he drops dead, 
   Valentina knowing that the camera is to blame. In case you haven't 
   guessed by now, Baba Yaga is a witch and Carlo's death is one of 
   camera's many victims. Even Annette comes to life (portrayed by Ely 
   Galleani; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#FiveDolls1970">FIVE DOLLS 
   FOR AN AUGUST MOON</A></B> - 1970) and we have to ask ourselves if

    Like I said before, this film is unclassifiable. It is like some Pop 
   Art dream coming to life, as it throws so many bizarre sights and 
   sounds into the mix, your head will be swimming, but in a good way. I 
   know what you are thinking: Why doesn't Valentina use a different 
   camera? She does, but the photos from that camera don't have her 
   patented &quot;feel&quot; to them, so she goes to her favorite camera 
   that does. Director/screenwriter Corrado Farina, who has a cameo as 
   the Nazi with the cat (as well as two other quick cameos!), was 
   usually a director of documentaries, his only other fictional film of 
   note being the political allegory disguised as a horror film, <B><A HREF="they_have_changed_their_face_1971.htm">THEY
    HAVE CHANGED THEIR FACE</A></B> (1970). Even if he never made 
   another film, this one would be considered a Pop Art masterpiece of 
   the macabre, as even the simplest of things turn out not in the way 
   they should, such as Arno's detergent <A HREF="baba_yaga_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/baba yaga italy poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>commercial,
    shot in the vein of an Eurospy film, which you have to see to 
   appreciate, as mere words don't do it justice. That basically covers 
   the whole film (this review was very hard to write), as simply 
   stating what is happening in no way does the visuals justice. The 
   Italian censors thought so, too, as they butchered the film before 
   they would allow it to be shown theatrically. It would take over 30 
   years before Farina's complete vision was shown to audiences, Farina 
   re-inserting the cut scenes back into the film in his new 
   &quot;director's cut&quot;. I guess back in 1973, the Italian censors 
   condemned what they could not understand (there are many veiled 
   swipes at Italy's corrupt government) and gave audiences a 
   bastardized look at a film they could not comprehend (or maybe they 
   did understand, but I doubt it). It's no surprise that the film was a 
   flop, because nearly all the nudity and sequences of S&amp;M violence 
   were edited out of the film, leaving audiences confused and 
   flabbergasted at what they were viewing.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Also known as <B><A HREF="baba_yaga_1973.htm#DevilWitch">THE DEVIL WITCH</A></B>,
    this film gained a U.S. theatrical release under the title <B><A HREF="baba_yaga_1973.htm#KissMeKillMe">KISS
    ME, KILL ME</A></B>. It, too, was the truncated Italian theatrical 
   cut and it didn't get very much traction in the States. This version 
   was also released on VHS (by <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Paragon Video">Paragon
    Video Productions</A>) and on budget DVD (by Diamond Entertainment 
   Group), in badly cropped fullscreen versions. It wasn't until Blue 
   Underground released it uncut and in its OAR that an appreciative 
   audience realized what a special film this actually is. I guarantee 
   that you will never see anything quite like it. You may not 
   understand it, but you won't be able to take your eyes off it. 
   Carroll Baker was no stranger to Italian genre films, appearing in 
   many, especially giallo flicks, during the late-'60s to the mid-'70s 
   (such as <B><A HREF="sweet_body_of_deborah_1968.htm">THE SWEET BODY

    FLOWER WITH THE DEADLY STING</A></B> - 1973; and many others). She's 
   quite good here, imbuing her role as Baba Yaga with just the right 
   amount of mystery and sexuality. I cannot recommend this film enough 
   to all the daring viewers out there who are interested in something 
   unusual, the closest I can come to explaining this film is it is like 
   a fever dream come to life. This film is very visual and trippy (even 
   the opening credits are unusual). Also starring Daniela Balzaretti, 
   Mario Paolo Giordani, Lorenzo Piani (<B><A HREF="riot_in_a_womens_prison_1974.htm">RIOT

    OF 1000 CORPSES</A></B> - 2002) and he tells he that a lot of that 
   has been going on lately. When Friday night rolls around and her car 
   won't start, Rick gives her a ride to the Stanton's, which seems to 
   annoy Jim somewhat (he offers to drive Angie back when he and the 
   missus return, rather than have Rick come back). This is going to be 
   a night Angie will not soon forget, as the stalker keeps ringing the 
   Stanton's phone, tries to get into the house and Angie discovers that 
   Sam is a creepy little kid. Not only does his diet consist solely of 
   little chunks of rare red meat, he likes to play hide-and-seek, 
   forcing Angie to search the entire house looking for him and making 
   some horrifying discoveries of her own. When the stalker (who is 
   horribly scarred from head to toe) breaks into the house brandishing 
   a weird, symbol-filled blade, Angie tries to grab Sam and flee, but 
   she will soon discover that she is running from the wrong people, as 
   the stalker turns out to be a priest, the Stanton's are actually 
   satanic cannibals (!) and Sam may actually be the son of Satan (he 
   has two little horns on the top of his head to prove it!). Can Angie 
   escape from this infernal trio or will she become steak tartar for 
   Sam's consumption? Let's just say God can be proud of Angie, as she 
   begins to get all biblical on the Stanton's asses, but there's enough 
   bad flesh left over for the inevitable sequel.&nbsp; This paean to 
   the horror films of the 70's (it's equal parts <B><A HREF="when_a_stranger_calls_1979.htm">WHEN

    TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE</A></B> [1974] and <B><A HREF="omen_1976.htm">THE
    OMEN</A></B> [1976]) basically defies normal description. It starts 
   out as a tale about a fish out of water (Where Angie has her first 
   experiences with the drug culture, romance, etc.), then turns into a 
   &quot;babysitter in peril&quot; tale, then turns into some weird 
   supernatural mumbo-jumbo involving priests trying to track down Sam 
   the Devil Child to kill him and finally turns into a <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hostel">HOSTEL</A></B>-like
    piece of torture porn (for lack of a better term), where Angie is 
   forced to watch Jim butcher some poor girl into little pieces and 
   placing the pieces in plastic bags for Sam's consumption later on, 
   while Jim prattles-on to Angie about what he and his wife have to do 
   to keep Sam from going hungry (This also helps some of the denser 
   viewers better understand what they are watching). The film doesn't 
   make a heckuva lotta sense, but first-time directors Jonas Barnes 
   (who also scripted) and Michael Manasseri (also one of the Producers) 
   inject a lot of excitement into the proceedings, as well as some 
   hard-to-watch gore (the butchering scenes are brutal, as are the 
   scenes of Sam brandishing a butcher knife while muttering 
   &quot;Hungry!&quot; over and over), making <B><A HREF="babysitter_wanted_2008b.htm">BABYSITTER
    WANTED</A></B> a good bet for fans of weird horror. I especially 
   find it amusing that a na&iuml;ve religious virgin would be the only 
   one with the intestinal fortitude to go the ultra-violent route to 
   get vengeance (not to mention dropping the f-bomb and other verbal 
   obscenities while doing so). Put a gun in Angie's hand and she'll 
   empty a clip in the bad guys' bodies without blinking once and she's 
   also not above punching a small child in the face. Ah, religion. What 
   would we do without it? Also starring Monty Bane, Nana Visitor, Jeff

    Henenlotter returns to the director's chair after a sixteen-year 
   hiatus (most of those years spent working with Mike Vraney at 
   Something Weird Video) and delivers a film that defies genre 
   conventions. Jennifer (Charlee Danielson) is a freak of nature: She 
   was born with seven clitorises (she may have more and everyone that 
   knows her calls her &quot;Crazy Pussy&quot;) and when we first meet 
   her, she is cruising a bar looking for a perfect male subject to 
   satisfy her unquenchable sexual desires. The only problem is, she 
   gets so carried away during the lovemaking act, she sometimes ends up 
   killing her male partner. Another annoying caveat is that she always 
   gets pregnant, but it's quite unlike any normal human pregnancy. Two 
   hours after her sex act is over with, she delivers an &quot;unfinished
    baby&quot;, which she always abandons, be it in a hotel bathtub, an 
   abandoned car in a junkyard or a garbage can. Yes, Jennifer has a 
   severe problem (she may be the world's only true nymphomaniac) and 
   when she can't find a man, she uses <A HREF="bad_biology_2008b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bad biology poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="232" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>a
    homemade vibrator to do the job (it's unlike any vibrator you have 
   ever seen!). Jennifer is also a professional photographer, whose 
   oeuvre is grotesque death portraits of her male victims and she also 
   takes equally disturbing shots during paid model shoots (such as 
   women with brightly colored wigs wearing vagina masks!). What 
   Jennifer needs is a man that can satisfy her every desire and that 
   man just may be Batz (Anthony Sneed), whose penis is so hyperactive, 
   it has a mind of its own (he has to tape it to his leg to keep it 
   from tapping the underside of tables and desks!). Batz feeds his cock 
   a wide variety of drug cocktails by hypodermic needle, including 
   growth hormones, to keep it under control (he even has a Rube 
   Goldberg-esque jerk-off contraption of his own design), but the fact 
   is, his penis is getting way too big for his body. During a photo 
   shoot at an apartment next to Batz's, Jennifer notices Batz's 
   condition and becomes very intrigued. Later that day, she breaks into 
   Batz's apartment with video camera in hand and ends up recording Batz 
   making love to a prostitute. The prostitute continues to have orgasms 
   long after Batz has finished (hours after he is done!), so he gags 
   her and drops her off in an alley. Jennifer is so impressed, she 
   plans on confronting Batz the next day with an offer he can't 
   possibly refuse, but she is too late. Batz's mutant penis detaches 
   itself from his body and leaves, going on a rape spree (but always 
   leaving the women in orgiastic pleasure). When the mutant penis 
   returns, Jennifer wants to nurture it, so she starts shooting drugs 
   into it over Batz's objections. The detached penis then fucks 
   Jennifer and for the first time in her life, she is sexually 
   satisfied (She says, &quot;It's like God is fucking me!&quot;). 
   Unfortunately, Jennifer, Batz and the mutant penis die, but not 
   before Jennifer gives birth to a mutant penis/baby hybrid, who walks 
   away into an uncertain future. I love happy endings!&nbsp; All I can 
   say is: Welcome back Frank Henenlotter! <B><A HREF="bad_biology_2008c.htm">BAD

   (a lot of rappers put in cameos and offer songs to the soundtrack 
   here, including Reef The Lost Cause, Vinnie Paz, Prince Paul, Big 
   Earth, Jzone and Remedy), is a wild black comedy about sexual morals 
   taken to a degree never seen on film before (this would make a 
   perfect double feature with Jonathan Yudis' <B><A HREF="pervert_2005.htm">PERVERT!</A></B> 
   - 2005). The sight of the mutant penis (a mixture of stop-motion 
   animation and practical makeup effects by Gabe Bartalos) breaking 
   through walls and floors to rape a bunch of nubile (and totally 
   naked) women is a vision that is not soon forgotten, as are the weird 
   camera set-ups; one being a POV shot from inside of Jennifer's vagina 
   (showing all seven of her clits) looking out on the horrified face of 
   one of her male victims (which is similar to the poster above, but 
   the U.S. DVD will not use this artwork because, let's face it, we're 
   a bunch of easily shocked puritanical prudes). This film may be low 
   in budget, but it registers high on the originality scale 
   (Henenlotter shot the entire film in 35mm and it looks gorgeous).

   using some psychic force on Rebecca's body in an attempt to revive 
   her, but Libby tries to intervene (&quot;You don't touch the 
   Teacher!&quot;) and is locked in the same bathroom as David and 
   Victor. Libby tells them that the Teacher is taking them to the other 
   side of the universe, but they all have to go to sleep first. 
   Thinking that everything is going to turn out like the Heaven's Gate 
   mass suicide, David and Victor try to find a way to escape, 
   especially when a seemingly-cured Rebecca shows up in the bathroom 
   and offers to take them on their trip. Meanwhile, David and Victor's 
   boss, Capt. Newsome (Dig Wayne), and David's pregnant wife Deborah 
   (Elizabeth Bogush), try to locate them, but the Quanta Group have 
   people on the outside covering up the evidence. The Teacher informs 
   our captive pair that the Earth will cease to exist in a matter of 
   weeks and offers to &quot;save&quot; them. The Teacher has a 
   &quot;formula&quot; (&quot;Numbers don't lie. People do.&quot;) that 
   proves &quot;a rain of fire will decend from above, incinerating all 
   life on Earth&quot; and explains to David and Victor that the Quanta 
   Group, made up of scientists, researchers and philosophers, are the 
   only people that will escape the Armageddon. The Teacher has 
   knowledge of both David and Victor's lives that he can't possibly 
   know about and it affects both David and Victor in very different 
   ways (Victor is a devout Catholic and David is an Athiest). Is it 
   possible that the Quanta Group is not a cult at all, but actually 
   humanity's last chance for survival? I'm afraid you'll have to 
   discover that for yourself. Let's just say that the ending is a 
   killer.&nbsp; Slow-moving, yet never uninvolving, <B><A HREF="believers_2007b.htm">BELIEVERS</A></B> 
   is a taut tale of people who either believe or refuse to, not just 
   about the end of the world, but also in God itself. Director Daniel 
   Myrick (co-director of the cult smash <B><A HREF="blair_witch_project_1999.htm">THE
    BLAIR WITCH PROJECT</A></B> [1999] and director of the horror films <B><A HREF="solstice_2007.htm">SOLSTICE</A></B> 
   [2007] and <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Objective2007">THE OBJECTIVE</A></B> 
   [2007]), working with a screenplay written by himself, Daniel Noah 
   and Julia Fair (<B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#AlienRaiders">ALIEN RAIDERS</A></B> 
   - 2008), has fashioned a religious allegory disguised as a sci-fi 
   thriller, a modern-day take on the Rapture. Myrick keeps us guessing 
   whether the Quanta Group and the Teacher himself are real or just 
   another brainwashing, mind-control cult with false doomsday 
   prophecies. The scene where Rebecca seduces and the makes love to 
   Victor while she repeats verbatim every word the Teacher (who has a 
   Control Room full of TV's, where he can monitor every room in the 
   compound) whispers in her ear (thanks to a small microphone implanted 
   in her skull) is an example of how this film plays with audiences' 
   expectations. The Believers think that the Teacher has real powers, 
   while the non-believers will think it is nothing but a susceptible 
   woman hypnotizing (by proxy) a man whose will has been weakened. In 
   the end, it all boils down to the differences in David and Victor's 
   backgrounds and those differences play a major role in how they react 
   to the situation. While the film is not that bloody, there are 
   extremely uncomfortable scenes, such as when David is 
   &quot;purged&quot; with a car battery. The ambient soundtrack, full 
   of low-range rumbles, electronic blips and whispering voices, adds to 
   the creepy atmosphere. Though not for everyone's tastes, <B><A HREF="believers_2007c.htm">BELIEVERS</A></B> 
   is a seriously deranged take on how religion can be used for evil as 
   well as good and how the best of intentions can come back and bite

    discover a photo of the dead girl on a spiritual tablet and that the 
   strange man left enough money for ten years of incense burning in her 
   honor. The Inspector notices a school badge in the girl's photograph, 
   which leads him to the Mu Kuang School. After interviewing people at 
   the school, the Inspector goes to the home of Lam Wai (Ai Fei), the 
   father of the dead girl, and he is arrested and put on trial for her 
   murder. Lam Wai explains in court that he killed his daughter because 
   someone cast a spell on him, so the judge orders that he be examined 
   by a psychiatrist before sentence is imposed (Lam Wai could be 
   looking at a death sentence for his crime). The psychiatrist's report 
   doesn't help him and Lam Wai is sentenced to hang. He asks to talk 
   with Inspector Wong and tells him the whole sordid story, which began 
   three months ago (flashback alert!) when he and some male friends 
   went on an &quot;anything goes&quot; vacation to Nanyang, Thailand 
   (30 years before <B><A HREF="hangover_part_2_2011.htm">THE HANGOVER 
   PART II</A></B>) . The married Lam Wai leaves the hotel to get a 
   &quot;body massage&quot; (yeah, right!) and meets a gorgeous girl 
   named Bon Brown (Chen Li Li; a.k.a. &quot;Lily Chan&quot;), who 
   feigns an ankle injury to get Lam Wai to carry her to her apartment. 
   Lam Wai thinks that she is a high-class prostitute (he buys her a 
   fake diamond-encrusted &quot;Love&quot; necklace) and makes love to 
   her on the beach (where she frolics topless), but he must end his 
   vacation and return back to his life in Hong Kong. Bon Brown gives 
   him a strange necklace to wear as a parting gift. The problem is, Bon 
   Brown has fallen in love with him, but Lam Wai only thinks of her as 
   a sexual conquest and brags about her to all his male co-workers (but 
   not his wife). When he fails to return to Bon Brown on the promised 
   date of June 30, 1981 (she writes &quot;30-6-81&quot; on a rock on 
   the beach and takes a photo of Lam Wai posing next to it), Lam Wai 
   begins suffering the supernatural consequences. At first he fails to 
   achieve an erection when making love to his wife, but things are 
   about to get much, much worse for him. It will all lead up to the 
   murder of his daughter. Lam Wai begs Inspector Wong to find the 
   spellcaster and bring the real killer to justice. Inspector Wong is 
   about to run head-first into the Far East witchcraft culture, as he 
   travels to Nanyang to uncover the truth. Can he save Lam Wai from the 
   hangman's noose or will he fall victim to the deadly &quot;Lemon 
   Spell&quot; (it's actually a lime, but believe me, you're going to 
   want to see this), the &quot;Split Head Spell&quot;, the &quot;Raising
    Demon Child Spell&quot;, the &quot;Strangling Spell&quot; and the 
   &quot;Death Spell&quot;? The moral to this story is that evil can 
   never win over good, but you still shouldn't have casual sex. It 
   always has consequences.&nbsp; Though slow to get started, <B><A HREF="bewitched_1981c.htm">BEWITCHED</A></B> 
   steadily builds to delirious heights, such as when the necklace Bon 
   Brown gave Lam Wai&nbsp; starts leaking brown liquid on his chest, 
   which refuses to wash off and then spreads all over his body in 
   puss-filled boils and unwanted body hair. Add to that a young 
   daughter who suddenly likes to eat raw meat and tries to kill Daddy 
   on several occasions and you would think that's enough story for one 
   film, right? Well, that's only the first half of the film, folks. The 
   second half details disbeliever Inspector Wong's investigation, as he 
   dovetails deeper and deeper into the supernatural subculture in 
   Thailand; at first learning (at a lengthy spirit ceremony) that Lam 
   Wai was put under the &quot;Oil Of Carcass Spell&quot;. We watch (in 
   another flashback) as this spell is performed, where a sorcerer 
   collects the oil from a rotting pregnant woman's corpse (he sticks a 
   needle in her foot, she sits up and the oil comes pouring out of her 
   nose!), mixes it with live maggots and sticks the necklace the Bon 
   Brown gave him in the liquid for three days. Inspector Wong then 
   travels 100 kilometers up river to ask a monk and exorcist priest 
   (Hussin Bin Abu Hassan; billed in the opening credits as 
   &quot;Renowned [sic] Malay Sorcerer&quot;) to remove the 
   &quot;Oil&quot; and &quot;Coffin Spell&quot; from Lam Wai before it 
   is too late. What we witness is an over-the-top (and downright 
   informational) battle of the sorcerers. To say any more would spoil 
   the surprises in store for the viewer, but director Kuei Chih-Hung 
   and screenwriter Shih Tu An (<B><A HREF="corpse_mania_1981.htm">CORPSE

   ARE LOOSE</A></B> - 1978) just painted turns into a grim, colorless 
   portrait of a hideous-looking old hag. He begins butting heads with 
   student doctor Leslie Valentine (Laura Johnson; Wes Craven's <B><A HREF="chiller_1985.htm">CHILLER</A></B> 
   - 1985), who doesn't agree with his &quot;pop psychology&quot; 
   approach and takes an interest in an unnamed patient of his. The 
   questions soon become: Is Leslie real or a figment of Dr. Mati's 
   imagination? Is the unnamed patient actually Dr. Mati? Things get 
   downright bizarre when a man Dr. Mati has never seen before threatens 
   to jump off the hospital's roof and someone phones Dr. Mati to talk 
   him down. When he gets to the roof, the strange man whispers 
   something into Dr. Mati's ear and then jumps off the roof, killing 
   himself. When one of his prize patients dies suddenly, even Dr. Mati 
   begins to doubt his sanity (When he tells his wife about her painting 
   changing from beautiful to ugly, she jokingly says, &quot;It's 
   simple, you're crazy!&quot;, not realizing that she may not be too 
   far off the mark), but he also thinks that someone may be trying to 
   drive him over the edge. The rest of the film details Dr. Mati's 
   search for the truth, but he might not like what he discovers. The 
   audience may not either, depending on their tolerance for existential 
   and oblique endings.&nbsp; Not a good film by any stretch of the 
   imagination, <B><A HREF="beyond_reason_1977b.htm">BEYOND REASON</A></B> 
   (originally titled <B><A HREF="mati_1977.htm">MATI</A></B>) is still 
   an interesting, if flawed, foray into one man's descent into madness. 
   The movie plays like one long picture puzzle, where the viewer is 
   given small visual pieces of the puzzle to put together as the film 
   progresses, but unfortunately, some of the pieces we are given seem 
   to belong to some puzzle never revealed. While Telly Savalas (<B><A HREF="horror_express_1972.htm">HORROR
    EXPRESS</A></B> - 1973; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Lisa&amp;TheDevil1973">LISA
    AND THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1973) is good as Dr. Mati, one wonders how 
   this film would have turned out in the hands of a more capable 
   director. While Savalas' script isn't too bad, the look of the film 
   is much too flat and TV-ish, like some Movie of the Week (even though 
   it was photographed by master cinematographer John A. Alonzo). There 
   are some weird touches, though, such as the blind begging vagrant 
   that gives Dr. Mati change for a ten-dollar bill and some of the 
   hallucinations in Dr. Mati's mind. Since the whole story is basically 
   told through Dr. Mati's eyes and mind, it's hard at first for the 
   viewer to get a grasp on what is fact or fiction, but it becomes 
   quite clear at the film's halfway mark that the reason why Dr. Mati 
   is such an effective (or rather, affective) psychiatrist is because 
   he, too, is harboring some deep, dark recessive memory that is slowly 
   coming to the forefront. The film does drag in spots, but it manages 
   to hold interest and the final shot may or may not imply that Dr. 
   Mati is just a figment of a criminally insane patient's imagination, 
   which gives everything that happened before it a whole new meaning. 
   What's more puzzling to me is why Savalas picked this story as his 
   only theatrical directing and writing credit. He seems to be 
   exorcising some personal demons here, although the end result will 
   leave the viewer unclear if he is pro or con on the subject of 
   psychiatry. Also starring Marvin Laird, Bob Basso, Douglas Dirkson, 
   Walter Brooke, Barney Phillips, Tony Burton, Lilyan Chauvin, Toni 
   Lawrence, Larry Golden and John Lisbon Wood. Originally released on

   brings out the worst in some people and it is easy to see why. It 
   mixes perverted sex with bloody gore, incestual relationships with 
   necrophilia and taxidermy with living forever. This horror film, by 
   director Joe D'Amato (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Anthropophagus1980">ANTHROPOPHAGUS</A></B>

    The film opens with Frank (Kieran Canter) picking up the dead body 
   of a baboon. Frank is a professional taxidermist, as we see him carry 
   the dead body into his workshop, which is littered with all kinds of 
   stuffed animals. We then witness an old woman sticking needles into a 
   voodoo doll. Frank's housekeeper Iris (Franca Stoppi; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#OtherHell">THE
    OTHER HELL</A></B> - 1980) hopes to hasten the death of Frank's wife 
   Anna (Cinzia Monreale; <B><A HREF="beyond_1981.htm">THE BEYOND</A></B> 
   - 1981) so she can have him all to herself. Anna is dying a slow 
   death in a hospital bed (it looks like the voodoo doll is working!) 
   and when Iris tells Frank almost too late that the hospital called 
   (she waited to tell him when he gets out of the shower totally naked 
   so she could see his body!), Frank rushes to the hospital, where Anna 
   gives him a final kiss goodbye before she dies. Frank is now a 
   shattered man and when Iris sees his face, she whips out one of her 
   breasts for Frank to suck on! Frank doesn't believe death is final, 
   as we watch him prepare his wife for her &quot;new&quot; life (he 
   gives Anna's body a hypodermic shot to stop her body from getting 
   stiff and rigored). The night after Anna's burial, Frank digs up her 
   body and brings it to his workshop. He almost gets caught with her 
   body by the police when his van gets a flat tire. After changing the 
   tire, Frank is surprised to find female hitch-hiker Jan (Lucia 
   D'Elia) sitting in the passenger seat. She rolls a joint while Frank 
   reluctantly drives and Anna's hand nearly hits Jan's head when it 
   juts out of the window of the van's partition. With Jan passed out on 
   the front seat (that must have been some good shit!), we watch Frank 
   carry the body of his dead wife to his workshop, where he cuts out 
   all of her internal organs (nothing is left to the imagination), 
   getting her prepared for the taxidermy process. We watch him take a 
   bite out of Anna's removed heart (blood comes squirting out of one of 
   the arteries!) and replace his wife eyes with glass ones. 
   Unfortunately, Jan wakes up, sees what Frank is doing and screams. 
   Frank smothers Jan, but not before removing her fingernails with 
   pliers! He then puts Jan's body in his van (which is, appropriately, 
   red in color). Iris also sees what Frank is doing, but instead of 
   being repulsed, she helps Frank dress Anna's nude body (she even puts 
   nail polish on Anna's fingernails). A friend of Frank's stops by the 
   house to pick up the stuffed baboon, but Frank was too busy with Anna 
   to take the time to stuff the monkey. It seems Frank's friend has 
   another reason for being there: He was paid by Mr. Kale (Sam Modesto) 
   to keep Frank busy while he searched the van. He picks up a cameo 
   necklace in the van and pockets it. But what is his real reason for 
   being there?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Iris had already moved Jan's body from the van and we watch Frank 
   drag her body into the bathroom, where Iris chops off Jan's head, 
   arms and legs with a meat cleaver and put the pieces in the bathtub, 
   which is full of acid. We see that Frank is sickened by the sight of 
   this especially when Jan's skull pops up out of the acid with one 
   eyeball still attached! We then watch Frank watching Iris eat. She 
   digs into her food like a pig in slop, causing Frank to puke 
   (&quot;What's the matter Frankie baby, heat getting to you?&quot;). 
   Frank then looks at Anna's corpse and it is not looking too good, but 
   Iris tries to get his mind off it by loosening his belt and putting 
   her hand down his pants (&quot;Don't worry, Frank. Iris is here.&quot;).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Mr. Kale has hired a private investigator to get all the background 
   information on Frank and his family (where we learn that Frank lost 
   his parents in a car accident when he was a teen). But why does he 
   want to know? We then see Frank jogging, following a pretty young 
   jogger (Anna Cardini; <B><A HREF="swindle_1977.htm">SWINDLE</A></B> - 
   1977) around. When he sees that she has sprained her ankle, he takes 
   her to his house for proper medical attention. He tapes up her ankle 
   and then they retire to the bedroom, where Frank has Anna's body on 
   another bed. he begins to make love to the young woman, but he is not 
   able to perform without looking at Anna, so he pulls off the blanket 
   covering her. The young woman sees Anna's ashen corpse and screams. 
   Frank takes a huge bite out of her neck and disposes of the corpse in 
   his personal incinerator (Which brings up the big question: Why 
   didn't they dispose of Jan's body the same way? It's a lot less messy!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A few days later, the police show up at Frank's door wondering if he 
   has seen the jogger. Iris invites them to come inside to search the 
   house (she even gives one of the cops a stuffed squirrel!). Iris 
   throws a dinner party for her family and she announces that enough 
   time has passed, as she and Frank are getting married on May 1st. 
   This takes Frank by surprise and he goes running out of the house. We 
   then see that Mr. Kale has broken into Frank's house and is searching 
   his workshop. He finds nothing and then searches Frank's bedroom, but 
   Anna's corpse is not on the bed. He hides in the attic when he hears 
   Iris approaching and finds Anna's taxidermied body in a cabinet. He 
   pulls a camera from his jacket pocket and takes a photo of the body. 
   But why?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Frank then goes to a disco and spots a lovely young woman who 
   catches his eye. The woman notices Frank looking at her and before 
   you know it, they end up at Frank's house, where we see the woman 
   totally nude and taking a bath (in the same tub where Jan's body was 
   dissolved). At the same time, Anna's twin sister, Eleanor (also 
   played by Cinzia Monreale), pays Frank a visit and when he sees her 
   talking to Iris, he believes his wife has returned from the dead, He 
   quickly shows the disco woman to the door and plans on reuniting with 
   his wife. But Iris, who will do anything to make Frank her one and 
   only, turns out the lights and calls out to Eleanor using Anna's 
   voice. Eleanor passes out after seeing Anna's dead body sitting on a 
   chair, but before Iris can stab Eleanor with a butcher knife, Frank 
   intervenes (and get stabbed in the crotch!). A seriously-injured 
   Frank is able to overpower Iris, first taking a healthy bite out of 
   her cheek and then stabbing her to death in the heart. He then 
   carries Eleanor's body upstairs.&nbsp; Mr. Kale arrives at the house 
   and when no one answers the doorbell or his constant knocks, he picks 
   the lock and lets himself in. He discovers Iris' dead body and a 
   mortally wounded Frank standing next to the incinerator. Mr. Kale, 
   who we learn was hired by Anna's father to find out what happened to 
   her body when he discovered that her grave has been robbed, scoops up 
   Anna's body and brings it to a church. A priest puts her body in a 
   coffin and closes the lid. The film ends with the lid of the coffin 
   flying open as it is Eleanor, not Anna, and she is very much alive!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Many people believe that this is Joe D'Amato's (Real name: Aristide 
   Massaccesi) best horror film and I would have to agree. It is better 
   known in the U.S. under the title <B><A HREF="buried_alive_1979b.htm">BURIED
    ALIVE</A></B>, where it was released theatrically and on VHS under 
   that title. Viewers were either repulsed or fascinated by this film. 
   I have yet to meet anyone who has a middle-of-the-road opinion about 
   it. Its themes of necrophilia and incest may have seemed taboo at the 
   time of its release, but we have become somewhat numb to those 
   themes, especially if we watch <B><A HREF="law_and_order_special_victims_unit_tv_series.htm">LAW
    &amp; ORDER: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT</A></B> on TV, which has used 
   themes of necrophilia and incest in many of their story lines. But 
   there is no doubt in my mind that this film caused a few upset 
   stomachs when originally viewed. I saw this at the <A HREF="buried_alive_1979_fabian theatre_showing.htm">Fabian
    Theatre</A> in Paterson,<A HREF="buried_alive_1979_fabian theatre_showing.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/buried alive 1979 ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="311" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   N.J. in 1980 and many people walked out of the theater. This was a 
   theater in a really bad part of town, so the audience were used to 
   violence and blood on the screen (and the Fabian was the premiere 
   grindhouse in Northern New Jersey), but it was still surprising to me 
   that so many people walked out. This was strong stuff, no doubt.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   from <A HREF="http://www.severin-films.com">Severin Films</A> that is

   and, above all, informative. He talks about his entire career and the 
   interview is sprinkled with some of the most notorious scenes of 
   D'Amato's films. Also rounding out the interview are comments by 
   Luigi Montefiori (a.k.a &quot;George Eastman&quot;; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Monster Hunter">MONSTER

   are downright gut-busting funny. I was particularly glad to hear that 
   D'Amato thinks that his <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Endgame">ENDGAME</A></B>

   Severin's disc is a 2016 live performance by Goblin of this film's 
   theme song. Many Italian horror films &quot;borrowed&quot; Goblin's 
   music from this film (The main offender being Bruno Mattei's <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#OtherHell">THE

   interview with Cinzia Monreale, an interview with Franca Stoppi, a 
   short documentary on the locations the film was shot at and the 
   theatrical trailer. All in all, a nice package. This film deserves it 
   notoriety, even though it may seem somewhat tame today. The 
   screenplay, by Ottavio Fabbri, goes for the jugular and succeeds.

   actress that looks absolutely professional when compared to her

    (SOV)! This is basically a two character movie but, like I said, you 
   won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. It opens with petty 
   thief Boris (Serbian Actor Lazar Rockwood in his debut film. More on 
   him later.) getting out of prison and chainsmoking like an industrial 
   smokestack. He hooks up with ex-girlfriend Wendy (Bonnie Beck. More 
   on her later also.) and comes up with a plan to rob her very wealthy wheelchair-bound
    employer Lord Breston. That night, Wendy lets Boris into Lord 
   Weston's Castle, where she says she drugged her boss with sleeping 
   pills (she even shows him the prescription bottle). Legend has it 
   that Lord Breston keeps a fortune of money in his basement, so Boris 
   finally picks the lock to the basement Door (Door #1) after trying 
   several times with no success&nbsp; (Bonnie says to Boris: 
   &quot;You're not a good thief!&quot; to which Boris replies, &quot;I'm
    getting better!&quot;). The basement door closes and locks behind 
   them and there is no lock to pick this time. A pre-recorded voice on 
   a reel-to-reel tape recorder, saying over a loud speaker that Lord 
   Breston knows they are there to rob from him (&quot;Welcome to my 
   chambers of terror!&quot;). He says that they will be tested on their 
   ingenuity and whatever they find they can keep. He gives them 20 
   seconds to get through the next door, as a metal door begins 
   descending from the ceiling, which they barely make it through 
   (Consider this Door #1.5) It leads them to a door which looks like a 
   large combination safe (Door #2) and the voice says, &quot;Count on 
   your wisdom.&quot; Boris is prepared and puts some digital timer on 
   the safe, which is supposed to give him the combination of the safe 
   door, but it doesn't work. Wendy says, &quot;Wait a minute, the voice 
   said 'Count on your wisdom'&quot; and counts the amount of letters in 
   each word of the sentence and comes up with the combination 5-2-4-6, 
   which opens up the door. They enter a room with large tiles, some 
   with letters and some with skulls and crossbones on them and the 
   recorded voice comes back on and says that the solution to this 
   puzzle has something to do with astronomy linked to Lord Breston. 
   Stepping on the wrong tile means death. Boris says, &quot;Astronomy 
   is not my strong suit. I dropped out in the tenth grade!&quot; They 
   first try the word JANUS and when Boris steps on the &quot;J&quot; 
   tile, the wall begins to move closer to them. They then try the word 
   &quot;RHEA&quot;, but it also is wrong and the wall moves even 
   closer. Wendy figures out the right word is &quot;JUNO&quot; and both 
   Boris and Wendy step on the letter &quot;O&quot; (Door #3) which 
   slowly descends into another chamber. (It still doesn't explain why 
   when Boris originally stepped on the &quot;J&quot; tile, the wall 
   moved in!). The recorded voice tells them that they have five minutes 
   to solve the next puzzle, but there is no puzzle to be found and 
   after the five minutes are up, metal spikes slowly begin decending 
   from the ceiling which will impale the duo unless Boris figures it 
   out (Boris yells out, &quot;Screw you! Screw you!&quot; to the 
   recorded voice, like it will answer him!). Boris finally figures out 
   that there must be a fake opening in one of the walls and begins 
   kicking the concrete walls until he finds the fake door (Door #4) 
   which they both get through just in time before they both become 
   shish-kebab. It leads to another chamber and Wendy falls through a 
   trap door in the floor (Door #5) and ends up in another chamber where 
   there is a male corpse (Played by Canadian street performer Ben Kerr) 
   holding a screwdriver and many pipes sticking out of the wall. Wendy 
   grabs the screwdriver from the corpse's rigored hand and begins 
   unscrewing a metal plate off the wall, only to find one of the screws 
   is longer than the others. It triggers the next deadly trap, as cold 
   water begins pouring out of the pipes, filling the chamber up with 
   water (Wendy rips off her sexy dress and tries to plug the pipes, 
   but, surprise!, it doesn't work.). Boris is trying to fish out an 
   extension cord from the spiked room with a retractable metal tape 
   meaure which he plans on throwing down to Wendy to pull her up out of 
   the water. He finally gets the extension cord, only to discover that 
   it is too short, so he takes off his belt and attaches it to the 
   cord, throwing it down to Wendy. She is able to grab it as the water 
   fills the chamber, but she weighs too much for Boris to pull her up 
   without breaking the cord. Boris tells Wendy to hang on and wait for 
   the water to recede (How does he know it will?) and Wendy complains 
   that she is suffering and losing feeling in her legs. Sure enough, 
   the water begins draining out of the chamber and Boris jumps down to 
   join Wendy. In one of the film's most twisted scenes, Boris begins to 
   kiss Wendy's legs and they make love (thankfully, off-screen!). We 
   next see a shirtless Boris asking Wendy why she has to wear such a 
   sexy outfit and Wendy replies that Lord Breston orders her to. Boris 
   says ,&quot;You look like a hooker. He's paralyzed from the 
   waist-down!&quot; Wendy snaps back, &quot;His hands aren't!&quot;. 
   Boris unscrews the metal plate (Door #6), which takes them to a room 
   where a million dollars in cash is in a metal breifcase sitting on a 
   table. The recorded voice comes back on and tells them that they can 
   leave honest people through the unlocked 7th Door if they don't take 
   the money. If they take the money, they will die. Wendy tries to talk

   finds the briefcase is connected to a trip wire that leads to a bomb, 
   so he takes a couple of bundles of cash out of the briefcase and he 
   and Wendy walk through the Seventh Door, which takes them to an 
   elevator to the first floor of the castle. Greed takes hold of Boris, 
   so he gives a bundle of cash to Wendy and tells her he will be right 
   back. He takes the elevator down to the room with the briefcase, 
   takes off his jacket and carefully begins to fill the jacket with 
   more bundles of cash, not realizing that the trip wire is based on 
   the weight in the briefcase. As he takes the final bundle out of the 
   briefcase, we hear the sound of an explosion and Boris is<A HREF="beyond_the_seventh_door_dvd_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/beyond the seventh door dvd front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="187" HEIGHT="269" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   killed (off-screen). In a surprise turn that no one saw coming 
   (including me), it turns out that she and Lord Breston (Gary 
   Freedman, whom we only see from behind in his wheelchair) play this 
   same scenario out on a regular basis. Yes, Wendy is a serial killer 
   and she and her boss get their jollies on killing people with their 
   ingenious traps (The corpse in the water chamber was one of Wendy's 
   victims.). The only thing that bothers Lord Breston is when he says 
   to Wendy, &quot;You don't have to make love to all of them, do 
   you?&quot; The film ends with Wendy dialing the phone and setting up 
   her next victim for tomorrow night (It does explain how she knew the 
   answers to some of the difficult puzzles, though). I cant begin to to 
   explain how awful this film is. But therein lies it's charms. Lazar 
   Rockwood (who makes Tommy Wiseau look like Laurence Olivier) doesn't 
   really act. He barely has a grasp on the English language, so he acts 
   by screaming out his dialogue, chainsmoking, waving his hands around 
   and jerking his head back-and-forth. There are no second takes in 
   this film as we listen to Boris butcher the King's English by blowing 
   some of his lines. You can barely understand what he is saying and it 
   is very hard to understand why he has had a fairly healthy acting 
   career, appearing in such Canadian tax shelter films as <B><A HREF="fearless_tiger_1991.htm">FEARLESS

   &quot;Lazar&quot; on the TNT series <B><A HREF="witchblade_tv_series_2001-2002.htm">WITCHBLADE</A></B> 
   (2001-2002)). He is still acting today (this review was written at

   (2007, starring Nick Mancuso) and was a religious novelist, writing 
   such books as &quot;<I>Virgin World &quot;</I> , &quot;<I>Seven Days 
   To Apocalypse</I> &quot; and his autobiography &quot;<I>They Called 
   me Disney</I> &quot;. It helps explain why he hired Lazar Rockwood 
   for his freshman English language film (Benedikt directed and wrote 
   several Yugoslavian animated shorts in the 60's) and filling it with 
   some laugh-out-loud moments, such as: Wendy: &quot;You smoke like a 
   chimney!&quot; Boris: &quot;I'll quit!&quot;, and other choice pieces 
   of dialogue mentioned in this review. This is a Canadian production, 
   filmed in Toronto, Ontario in what looks like the boiler room of some 
   abandoned industrial building (It was actually filmed on location at 
   the famous Casa Loma castle and in special studio-designed 
   &quot;chambers of terror&quot; according to Benedikt's biography.). 
   There is absolutely no nudity (even though Wendy takes a shower at 
   the end of the film) or bloody violence in this film, just the corpse 
   in the water chamber, yet this film seems so perverse, you'll have a 
   hard time getting up to go to the bathroom because this film is so 
   deliriously hypnotic to watch. Finally released on DVD by InterVision 
   Pictures Corp. (A sub-division of <A HREF="http://www.severin-films.com">Severin
    Films</A>) in a fairly clean fullscreen print (this is video, so a 
   widescreen print would cut out a lot of visual information). The only 
   problem with this film (besides the film itself) is that the sound is 
   sometimes out of synch with the actors' lip movements. It's not a 
   deal-breaker, but you think they could have fixed it (Even the 
   streaming version on Amazon Prime has the same problem). Just when I 
   thought I have seen it all, this film ends up in my mailbox. Highly 
   recommended for all lovers of bad films. Must be watched with a group 
   of people to be fully appreciated. <B>Not Rated</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

    smock on him and hires him as an apprentice butcher. At the same 
   time, a UFO (a bad model on a string) lands in town and the aliens 
   (two wind-up toy robots) revive the mayor's dead body and possess the 
   body of young, budding scientist Jan Wczinski (Andrew Gillies). The 
   aliens' goal: Construct a landing pad for an alien invasion and steal 
   the contents in the pit of spoiled meat that Rob keeps beneath a trap 
   door his butcher shop. It seems the contents are fermenting into a 
   substance known as &quot;Bolonium&quot; (Really?), which is the fuel 
   the aliens need to power their spaceships. The resurrected mayor 
   tries to close down Rob's butcher shop to gain access to the 
   Bolonium, only he doesn't count on the murderous Abdullah being there 
   to stop him. Meanwhile, Jan (who, for some unknown reason, doesn't 
   seem to be possessed anymore) has created a jet engine that runs on 
   Bolonium, so he attaches it to the Mayor's vintage Cadillac and flies 
   it on a collision course with the alien spaceship. The film ends on a 
   happy note, but not once does it address the questions on every 
   viewer's mind: Where did Abdullah come from and why does he want to 
   kill everyone?&nbsp; This pretty bad horror musical tries way too 
   hard to make itself into a cult film and it just doesn't work. 
   Director Chris Windsor (his only directorial credit) places the film 
   in some alternate 1950's universe, where people wear fedoras, drive 
   Cadillacs (the kind with the big fins) and break into song and dance 
   to advance the plot. Bluntly put, the songs (a strange mixture of 
   ballads, doo-wop and new wave tunes) are terrible and the lipsynching 
   by the cast of amateur actors rarely match the lyrics on the 
   soundtrack. Windsor (who co-wrote this mess with Producer Laurence 
   Keane) tries to make a musical version of <B><A HREF="plan_nine_from_outer_space_1959.htm">PLAN
    NINE FROM OUTER SPACE</A></B> (1959), complete with dimestore 
   special effects and deliberate bad line readings, but you can't 
   purposely set out to make a bad cult film. It's the audience that 
   decides whether a film becomes a cult phenomena and <B><A HREF="big_meat_eater_1982b.htm">BIG
    MEAT EATER</A></B> is just too low-rent and uninvolving to register 
   with audiences the way <B>PLAN NINE</B> or <B>ROCKY HORROR</B> did. 
   It tries too hard to be different, as Abdullah walks around wearing a 
   fez, a sub-plot concerning a family of Gypsies (who either warn 
   everyone in town about the alien evil or contribute to it) goes 
   nowhere and Rob is one of the most clueless people in film history. 
   There are a few shots of bloody gore, but it is so cheaply done and 
   out-of-place here, I can hardly see anyone being impressed by it. I 
   can see what Windsor was trying to achieve here, but his results fail 
   to hit their intended mark. On a whole, <B>BIG MEAT EATER</B> can't 
   even be considered an interesting failure. It's just a failure. Also

   which inexplicably has a huge following, not because it is a good 
   film, but because it is the exact opposite. It is a turd of the 
   highest order; a film that was shot (and edited) on a store-bought

    Which brings us to this question: Why would anyone in their right 
   mind remake this film? Well, the good news is that first-time 
   director Jonathan Lewis and screenwriters Shawn Lewis &amp; Mitchell 
   Mayes have taken the original film's concept to a whole new raunchy 
   level full of sex, body fluids, drug use and jokes so off-color, if 
   Redd Foxx were still alive, he would have had that fatal heart attack 
   and his last words would be, &quot;Elizabeth, I'm coming to join you 
   honey!&quot; That's not to say <B><A HREF="black_devil_doll_2007b.htm">BLACK
    DEVIL DOLL</A></B> is a good film (it's not), but it is just 
   different enough to merit at least one viewing. The film opens with 
   an amusing piece of animation where BDD grabs a female member of the 
   MPAA and fucks her doggie-style just after he butchers all the male 
   members with a knife. The film proper then begins, as we watch a 
   black militant prisoner fry in the electric chair and then the 
   opening credits roll like some faux-70's blaxploitation film, with a 
   funky, brassy music score playing on the soundtrack (by the excellent 
   Giallos Flame; search out their soundtrack CD of the film and you 
   won't be disappointed). High school girl Heather (the slightly plump 
   and big-breasted Heather Murphy, who looks at least ten years too old 
   to be in high school) gets bored and decides to mess with an Ouija 
   Board (Will they never learn?) the same time the black militant (who 
   raped and killed 15 white women) is being killed in the electric 
   chair. His spirit enters Heather's white ventriloquist doll and 
   transforms it into a black big-afroed, jive-talking, sex and 
   drug-crazed puppet from Hell. The BDD professes his innocence to 
   Heather (the &quot;Man&quot; set him up) and she instantly falls in 
   love with him (performing oral and straight sex on him; he then goes 
   down on her and they even take walks together at sunset!), while 
   Heather's ex-boyfriend, White-T (Martin Boone) keeps close tabs on 
   them. BDD soon grows tired of having one white &quot;bitch&quot;, so 
   he talks the infatuated Heather into getting all her other white 
   girlfriends, Natasha (Natasha Talonz), Candi (Christine Svendsen), 
   Buffy (Erika Branish) and Bambi (Precious Cox), to come over (We 
   first see them all together washing a car in the driveway dressed in 
   skimpy clothes, while BDD jerks-off and ejaculates an amazing amount 
   of semen against a window!). After a not-so-sly endorsement for <A HREF="http://www.rottencotton.com">Rotten
    Cotton</A> (Producer/co-scripter Shawn Lewis' tee shirt company, 
   which also sells the DVD and posters of this film), the girls compare 
   their boobs (lots of silicone on view) and play Twister in front of 
   an increasingly horny BDD. Heather leaves the house and BDD proceeds 
   to drug and rape the four girls (lots of jiggling silicone) and 
   savagely kills them, but not necessarily in that order (instead of 
   Nam flashbacks, he gets Black Panther flashbacks!), by knife, bathtub 
   electrocution, baseball bat to the head and a slit throat, while 
   Heather enjoys a burger and fries at a fast food joint. He even finds 
   time to strangle and butt-fuck White-T (&quot;Damn, that shit is 
   tight!&quot;) when he comes to the house to win back Heather! When 
   Heather returns home and sees the dead bodies of her friends (&quot;I 
   thought you were going to fuck them, not kill them!&quot;), she blows 
   several dozen holes into BDD (next to a poster of Patrick Dempsey 
   from <B><A HREF="greys_anatomy_tv.htm">GREY'S ANATOMY</A></B>) with a 
   gun that seems to never run out of bullets (a really funny scene), 
   but the she immediately gives birth to BDD Jr.!&nbsp; Like I said 
   before, this is not a good film by any stretch of the imagination, 
   but it gets positive points for at least trying to be outrageous and 
   paying homage to several genres (blaxploitation and spaghetti 
   westerns immediately spring to mind). Unfortunately, the terrible, 
   amateurish acting by everyone involved (Heather's four female friends 
   look like they were grabbed from a strip club and told they were 
   going to be in a film), except for the puppet, and the over-reliance 
   on flashy editing (split, triple and quadruple screens are wildly 
   overused) drag the film down a few notches. Still, where else are you 
   going to see a puppet eat-out a girl's ass, jizz all over another 
   dead girl's face and then have explosive (and acidic) diarrhea? The 
   effects are low-rent (but effective) and there is plenty of near-X 
   nudity and sex (although I'm not a big fan of women who are more 
   plastic than natural), so if you are in the mood for something cheap, 
   lewd and unusual, <B><A HREF="black_devil_doll_2007c.htm">BLACK DEVIL DOLL</A></B>

   like cheap superheroes than cultists), are in the midst of 
   sacrificing a young woman to their goddess Isabella, whose naked body 
   is crucified before them, her body rotting with a huge hole in her 
   chest (smack dab in the middle of her cleavage!). This is one of the 
   strangest human sacrifices that I have ever seen in a film, as it 
   contains jackhammer editing (by Polselli), lots of gel lighting and 
   hardly any dialogue, just a dog howling and plenty of bongos playing 
   on the soundtrack. The cultists carve out the young woman's heart 
   (she is topless, with a red satin sheet covering her most private of 
   parts) and give it to Isabella, who is without a heart (hence the 
   huge hole in her chest). The young woman's name is Raquel and somehow 
   her sacrifice affects Laureen (Rita Calderoni<B>; <A HREF="#QuietPlaceCountry68">A
    QUIET PLACE IN THE COUNTRY</A></B> - 1968; who also portrays 
   Isabella). When Raquel is being sacrificed, Laureen has a vivid 
   nightmare where she is being tortured and attacked by bats. I really 
   don't know what it has to do with the rest of the film, but maybe 
   describing what happens&nbsp; will trigger an &quot;aha!&quot; moment 
   and I can make sense of it all. If not, at least you'll be just as 
   confused as I am!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Laureen is the stepdaughter of Jack Nelson (Mickey Hargitay; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#BloodyPitHorror1965">THE
    BLOODY PIT OF HORROR</A></B> - 1965), a rich industrialist who 
   bought Laureen an expensive piano, but the village priest (Gabriele 
   Bentivoglio; <B><A HREF="perfume_of_the_lady_in_black_1974.htm">THE 
   PERFUME OF THE LADY IN BLACK</A></B> - 1974) doesn't like the sound 
   it makes when Laureen plays it. Why? Damned if I know. Laureen is 
   about to get married to local man Richard Brenton (William Darni). At 
   the wedding, Jack has a flashback that takes place 500 years earlier, 
   where his ancestor watches the superstitious locals tie Isabella to a 
   cross and drive a wooden stake through her heart (which would explain 
   the huge hole in her cleavage), then burning her alive, while his 
   ancestor (also portrayed by Hargitay) screams that she will live 
   again. Not only did the villagers accuse Isabella of being a witch, 
   they also believed she was a vampire! Everytime Jack glances at his 
   stepdaughter, he has the look of longing on his face, meaning he 
   looks forward to the day that Isabella returns to life and can be in 
   his arms once again. Laureen keeps having visions (?) of someone 
   sneaking up behind her and rubbing their hands over her breasts and 
   the rest of her body, Laureen reaching a climax. Is it possible she 
   is seeing this though Isabella's eyes? Is she the &quot;<A HREF="reincarnation_of_isabel_1973.htm#Reincarnation">Reincarnation

    We then discover that Raquel was one of seven female friends, all of 
   them virgins (hard to believe considering the way they look!), who 
   have come to participate in friend Laureen's wedding. The four 
   cultists need seven virgin sacrifices to bring back Isabella to life 
   (or at least I think they do!). The next virgin to be sacrificed is 
   Christa (Krista Barrymore), Laureen finding her dead naked body on 
   the castle's stairs. At Christa's funeral, the priest tells Jack that 
   Satan is near and he smiles, as Gerg (Bonini Marcello; <B><A HREF="so_sweet_so_perverse_1969.htm">SO
    SWEET...SO PERVERSE</A></B> - 1969) shovels dirt on Christa's 
   coffin. We then see that Christa is very much alive (or undead?), 
   screaming and banging on the inside of her casket for someone to let 
   her out. Gerg hears her screams and laughs (there's a lot of that in 
   this film!), knowing that she is better off dead (or at least that's 
   the way I think he feels). Christa's friend Mabel (Carmen Young) 
   hears Christa's screams and tells the priest, who says she's 
   imagining it due to her grief (she then forgets about the whole matter!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Laureen is kidnapped and put in a booby-trapped cage in the castle 
   dungeon, where one of its walls has knives protruding from it and it 
   moves closer and closer towards her. Her screams are heard by 
   Richard, who comes to her rescue before she is turned into human 
   shish-kebab (Jack tells Richard that she must have gone exploring in 
   his castle's basement and did this to herself!). That night, another 
   one of the virgins, Steffy (Stefania Fassio), tells fellow virgin 
   Viveca (Marisa Indice) that she just saw Christa at their bedroom 
   window and stutterer Rocha (Raul Lovecchio, listed in the credits as 
   &quot;Raoul&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#KidnapSyndicate">KIDNAP
    SYNDICATE</A></B> - 1975) enters their bedroom and seduces the both 
   of them (but, apparently, didn't take their virginity!). A strong 
   wind then blows open all the windows in the castle and the story 
   really goes off the rails. Jack enters virgin Elizabeth's (Anna 
   Ardizzone) bedroom, bites her on her neck and she enjoys it, moaning 
   in pleasure. The cultists enter the castle (it is at this time that 
   we discover Jack is one of the cultists) and begin sexually 
   assaulting all the remaining virgins, but they love it. Elizabeth 
   runs away from a laughing Jack and he chases her outside, where she 
   meets a naked Mabel. We then see a huge wooden cross on fire, as an 
   old woman from the village accuses Elizabeth and Mabel of setting the 
   village's religious symbol on fire. The whole village shows up, 
   poking sticks at Elizabeth and Mabel's naked bodies as they lie on

   says that if they are really possessed, they will not survive the

    imagery, none of it having anything to do with what comes before or 
   after it. The non-linear way the story is told is very confusing, but 
   never boring. Nearly every young women in this film spends more time 
   out of their clothes than in them. Renato Polselli, who also wrote 
   the screenplay, has the young actresses act aroused all the time, 
   making it hard for us to believe they are virgins (not every virgin 
   is sexually repressed, but you will find none of that in this film!). 
   But he films all the lovemaking between men and women in a comical 
   way, using fast, circus-like music during the sex scenes (making it 
   look and sound like a Benny Hill sketch), even going as far as to 
   show Rocha spitting out pubic hair from his mouth the entire time he 
   is getting laid! But Poselli is a fascinating filmmaker nonetheless, 
   using unusual camera angles to film some scenes and bathing shots in 
   bright primary colors (which will remind you of Dario Argento's <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Suspiria1977">SUSPIRIA</A></B>

    DELIRIUM</A><A NAME="BloodDelirium1988"></A> (1988) -</B> This film 
   is going to be hard to explain. Music composer Sybille (Brigitte 
   Christensen, who spends the first few minutes topless) comes home and 
   listens to the phone messages on her answering machine. To her 
   surprise, one of the messages is from herself......from the future! 
   On the message, she tells herself that they are like two flames that 
   burn as one. While the message is playing, Sybille's piano starts 
   playing by itself and objects start flying around the room. When her 
   fiance, Gerard (Marco Di Stefano), comes over and she tells him what 
   she heard and witnessed, he tells her that she's simply been working 
   to hard and her mind is playing tricks on her. At the same time, 
   famous painter Charles Saint Simone (John Phillip Law), known simply 
   as &quot;Maestro&quot;, is at his dying wife Christine's (also 
   portrayed by Christensen) bedside. Before she dies, she tells her 
   husband about &quot;two flames that burn as one&quot; and how she 
   will come back from the dead to be with him again. After his wife's 
   death, the Maestro goes quite mad and, for a year, he is unable to 
   paint anything to his satisfaction. He gets the bright idea to dig up 
   Christine's corpse for inspiration, so he and his servant, Hermann 
   (Gordon Mitchell), who secretly pined for Christine (we see him kiss 
   her all over her dead body during her wake a year earlier!), dig up 
   her body and place her maggot-ridden corpse by her piano.<A HREF="blood_delirium_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blood delirium vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Yes, Christine was also a composer and her last composition, titled 
   &quot;Delirium&quot;, echoes in the Maestro's head. The Maestro 
   paints a mask of Christine's face, puts it over the skull of his dead 
   wife's corpse and starts painting again, but when the mask falls off, 
   he loses his mind even more, as he imagines that his wife is laughing 
   at him. He ends up burning over one hundred of his valuable paintings 
   along with his wife's corpse. Now here's when it really begins to get 
   strange. When Sybille is playing piano at her home, a window blows 
   open and an invitation to one of the Maestro's gallery showings blows 
   in. Sybille goes to the gallery and as soon as the Maestro sets sight 
   of her, he thinks his wife has come back to him. To make a crazy long 
   story short, Sybille ends up at the Maestro's castle and is soon 
   wearing Christine's clothes and playing Christine's music, while the 
   Maestro (who thinks he is the reincarnation of Van Gogh) begins 
   painting in earnest again. He still can't seem to paint what he feels 
   (He says to Sybille, &quot;Can you give me the color of 
   suffering?&quot;), but when the even loonier Hermann rapes and kills 
   a local girl, the Maestro finds that missing element in his 
   paintings: Blood! He hangs the murdered girl upside down and drains 
   the body of all it's blood and uses the red stuff liberally in his 
   paintings. When Sybille accidentally discovers Hermann cutting up the 
   body and disposing of the parts in an acid bath, the Maestro 
   drugs&nbsp; and locks her in her bedroom. Things get weirder from 
   here, as the Maestro runs out of blood (&quot;I need more 
   color!&quot;), so he has Hermann kill one of Sybille's nosy friends. 
   As Gerard rushes to help Sybille (he owns a two seater helicopter!), 
   the finale finds &quot;future Sybille&quot; (thought the filmmakers 
   forgot about her, didn't you?) saving both Gerard and Sybille (who 
   are slowly being bled to death) and dropping pieces of the castle 
   down on the Maestro (who, in keeping with the Van Gogh tradition, has 
   cut off his own ear) and Hermann, killing them.&nbsp; Of course, none 
   of this film makes an ounce of sense, but it is so out-there and 
   unusual, it will hold you in it's loony, hypnotic spell.&nbsp; It 
   should come as no surprise that this tale of obsession and possession 
   was directed and co-scripted by Sergio Bergonzelli (identifed on some 
   prints as &quot;Peter Hudson&quot;), who gave us the equally demented <B><A HREF="#InFoldsFlesh">IN
    THE FOLDS OF THE FLESH</A></B> (1970). Just like that film, <B><A HREF="blood_delirium_1988b.htm">BLOOD
    DELIRIUM</A></B> is all over the map, throwing one twisted visual 
   after another at us, whether it be Hermann's insatiable urge to 
   fondle and kiss dead naked female bodies, the Maestro's obsession 
   with Van Gogh or Sybille being kept drugged in a glass coffin (not to 
   mention acid baths, which appear in both films). Also, just like in <B>FOLDS</B>,
    there's a twisted family dynamic going on, especially the 
   relationship between master Maestro and servant Hermann. The Maestro 
   professes his hatred of Hermann to Sybille, but the truth of the 
   matter is one couldn't survive without the other. Both John Phillip 
   Law (<B><A HREF="action.htm#AmericanCommandos">AMERICAN COMMANDOS</A></B> 
   - 1985) and Gordon Mitchell (<B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Endgame">ENDGAME</A></B> 
   - 1983) overact shamelessly (Truth be told, I've never seen either of 
   them more animated than they are here, as they both are usually very 
   stiff), but it suits this film like a comfortable pair of shoes on an 
   aching pair of feet. Watching this film is like taking a short 
   hallucinogenic acid trip, where time travel, body parts, copious 
   amounts of nudity, necrophelia, paintings that bleed, spontaneously 
   combust or explode, electrified doorknobs, vengeful spirits that 
   manifest themselves as orbs of light and enough blood to satisfy the 
   Red Cross for a month fleet across the screen and embed themselves in 
   your brain. What more could you want? An undiscovered classic of 
   weird cinema. Also starring Olinka Hardiman and Lucia Prato. Never 
   released legitimately on home video in the U.S., the print I viewed 
   was taken from a Greek-subtitled VHS tape. <B>Not Rated</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

    DEMON RISING</A><A NAME="BloodDemonRisn16"></A> (2012 - 2016) -</B> 
   Here's a pure horror film from the makers of the gore/slasher/sci-fi 
   hybrid film <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Spaceship Terror11">SPACESHIP
    TERROR</A></B> (2011 -2014) and just like that film, this one took 
   four years to make, is chock-full of terrible CGI and contains some 
   of the worst acting on this planet, yet it is fascinating to watch 
   just for the sheer weirdness of it all. This Tacoma, 
   Washington-lensed flick opens with the camera panning down on an 
   obvious CGI castle, where a group of cultists gather to witness a 
   ritual offering to the Grimises Demon (Stephen Lestat), a creature 
   with horns protruding out of his head. The offering is a topless 
   woman on an altar and when Grimises bites her breast and drinks her 
   blood, he yells <A HREF="blood_demon_rising_2014-2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blood demon rising poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="172" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>out,
    &quot;You poisoned me!&quot; (My guess is that the woman wasn't a 
   virgin). The leader of the cult, James (Norman Newkirk), orders his 
   guards to kill all of the cult members and they do so (lots of 
   stabbings and slit throats). James decides to open the castle as a 
   Haunted House Amusement Park for Halloween, where he plans on 
   kidnapping female guests to satisfy the demon's thirst for female 
   blood (Grimises demands that the women be pure and follow the 
   Christian way!). We then switch over to the Catholic Church at the 
   Vatican, where Father Paul (Bruce Weech) sends Father Samuel (Simone 
   Leorin) to destroy Grimises, using the &quot;Judas Knife&quot;. 
   Legend has it that the traitor Judas took his thirty pieces of silver 
   (for betraying Jesus) and melted his payment to make the knife, which 
   was meant to be used to kill demons. It has been sitting in the 
   Vatican for hundreds of years and now is the time to use it. At the 
   opening of the Haunted House (where James uses mutilated bodies of 
   his tortured victims to scare the ticket-buyers), Joanna (Ronee 
   Collins) and Vicky (Chelsey Tillich), along with boyfriends Shawn 
   (Logan Littlefield) and Dave (Jareth Hixon, who is simply a horrible 
   actor), pay forty dollars for their tickets , where the female 
   ticket-taker has her lips sewn shut and only talks with the aid of 
   holding up signs (this part is funny as hell!). Only two people are 
   allowed to enter the amusement park at a time, so instead of them 
   going as a couple, Joanna and Vicky decide to enter by themselves. 
   Big Mistake. Grimices thinks that they will be good vessels for his 
   seed, so James goes about of leading them to a jail cell, where James 
   has his guards strip them naked and put white robes on (White for 
   &quot;purity&quot;, but, shit, they have boyfriends. Does Grimices 
   really think they are virgins?). Grimices looks at them in the cell 
   and says, &quot;Im the cat and you're my bird!&quot; (Previously, 
   Joanna is frightened out of her mind when she is almost on the losing 
   end of the blade of a knife when it comes thrusting out of a wall. It 
   seems that James has stabbed his wife in the mouth for talking too 
   much and pinned her to the wall!). Grimises takes some of their blood 
   and mixes it in with his, which creates a worm-like creature, which 
   James puts on the women's stomachs and it enters their body through 
   their navel. Grimices says now they are pregnant and will deliver 
   babies within two days (!), and he will inhabit the soul of one of 
   the infants. Meanwhile, Shawn and Dave (who, in a bid for 
   cross-promotion, are wearing red sweat shirts with <B>&quot;Spaceship 
   Terror Film Crew 2010&quot;</B> silk-screened on them)&nbsp; go in 
   search of their girlfriends (They see a gagged woman in a 
   strait-jacket wiggling on a table and Shawn says, &quot;What do you 
   call an epileptic in a lettuce patch? Seizure Salad!&quot; Really?). 
   Dave and Shawn exit the amusement park without finding their 
   girlfriends, so they try sneaking back into the castle and Father 
   Samuel catches them and says that their girlfriends are probably home 
   laughing at them. (Shawn unbelievably says to the priest, &quot;You 
   know us guys. Young, dumb and full of cum!&quot;) and wait for Father 
   Samuel to leave. They sneak into the castle through a window and 
   search a closet, where they see a man with a bloodied face and his 
   eyeball hanging out of the socket, who says to the pair, &quot;My 
   girlfriend was kidnapped. Get the hell out of here before it is too 
   late!&quot; and then dies. More determined to find their girlfriends 
   than ever, they go off and search the rest of the castle. In the 
   film's most effective scene, the two guys run into an evil little 
   girl holding a knife (Gabrielle Urban, the best thing about this 
   film. She out-acts everyone else in the cast). She asks the guys 
   &quot;Do you like my dress? I'm going to get one that was stolen from 
   me which I like better!&quot; (every once in a while a CGI spider 
   comes out of her hair and crawls on her face). When Dave asks her to 
   give him the knife, that is just what she does, right in his leg! She 
   runs away, killing the woman who stole her polka dot dress. Then two 
   female vampire servants of Grimices (they are listed in the closing 
   credits as &quot; Female Vimpire Servents&quot;) attack and bite 
   Shawn and Dave and Grimices is furious when he catches them doing 
   it.&nbsp; He makes them disappear in a puff of CGI smoke. We next see 
   Dave and Shawn in the jail cell, where they see some masked cult 
   guards walking past them. Shawn throws his Zippo at them and hits one 
   of them on the head, but he doesn't turn around. Dave says that they 
   are zombies and continues with &quot;What's next, Werewolves?&quot; 
   The film instantly goes to James standing next to a sign on the wall 
   that reads, &quot;Werewolves do it doggy style&quot;! Father Samuel 
   meets local priest Father John (Tom<A HREF="blood_demon_rising_2014-2016b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blood demon rising poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Ricciardelli) at Marcia's Diner (where <B><A HREF="spaceship_terror_2011-2014.htm">SPACESHIP
    TERROR</A></B>'s Yulia Hancheroff is their waitress) and Father John 
   tells him that several prominent people in the community have 
   disappeared. They were known to be in a cult that believed in eternal 
   life through vampirism (earlier in the film, Grimices offered James 
   eternal life if he did his bidding). Vicky isn't responding to the 
   two-day pregnancy as well as Joanna is (I guess Vicky is not a 
   virgin, but she is now a vampire!) and dies in front of Dave (his 
   response to seeing her die should be in the Worst Acting Hall Of 
   Fame!). Father Samuel enters the Haunted House Amusement park with 
   his Judas Knife and new friend Mindy (Samantha Ram), because neither 
   of them came with a friend and the amusement park only allows two 
   people at a time to enter. Mindy is whisked away for Grimices food 
   and Father Samuel hides out in the castle when the amusement park 
   closes. (James gives everyone five minutes to vacate the castle and 
   when he runs into a couple that are late to leave, he strips the 
   woman topless and chops her up into pieces with a hand axe [Shown as 
   shadows against the wall]. The man has a hot poker shoved in his eye 
   and then has his tongue cut out [not shown as shadows against the 
   wall]). We then see Joanne deliver her baby (which actually looks 
   like a six-month old baby boy!), as Father Samuel, dressed as a cult 
   member, pulls out his Judas Knife and stabs the Grimices Demon, 
   killing him (it is done so matter-of-factly, with absolutely no fight 
   whatsoever). To make sure the Grimices Demon's soul doesn't enter the 
   baby's body, Joanna kills the baby with a sword (!) and all of 
   Grimices' followers die, except for James. The film ends with James 
   meeting the evil little girl (who is now wearing a bloodied polka dot 
   dress) and she wants to know if she can join James on his trip to the 
   Netherworld. James says, &quot;Yes, I love little girls!&quot; and we 
   see the little girl's actual face (another bad bit of CGI) THE END. 
   Director/co-producer/screenwriter/editor Harry Tchinski has once 
   again made a film that should have failed miserably, but it is so 
   &quot;out there&quot;, you can't help but watch and enjoy it. 
   Everything that I hate, including bad CGI (done by Tchinski), 
   horrible acting and bare-bones sets, should make this a loser for me, 
   but Tchinski somehow manages to make this film an enjoyable ride. 
   Just like in his previous film, wife Wendy Tchinski and Doug Hudson 
   supply better-than-average physical effects and the music score, by 
   Eric Bridenbaker, is better than it has any right to be. Fans of 
   weird cinema will want to search this one out. I saw <B><A HREF="blood_demon_rising_2014-2016b.htm">BLOOD

   It's ultra low-budget, but the film is a grand watch.&nbsp; First the 
   bad news: It's a Troma DVD release which means we have to put up with 
   one of Lloyd Kaufman's unskippable insipid openings, this time with a 
   laughing Debbie Rochon and it offers nothing about this film because 
   it isn't about the film. Every time the film's title is mentioned, 
   there's always something covering Kaufman's and Rochon's mouths, so

    be about any film. Just add another voice to dub a different title. 
   It's the nadir of openings and Rochon looks stoned to the gills. Now 
   the good news: For once, Troma decided to show the film in widescreen 
   (although not anamorphic, so you'll have to fiddle with your HD TV's 
   settings) and it looks great. How many times have you heard that 
   about a Troma DVD (especially one before 2013)? This film was shot 
   under the title <B><A HREF="rocky_trails_2010.htm">ROCKY TRAILS</A></B>,
    but when Troma acquired it, they changed the name to a more 
   exploitative title and for once it actually fits the film. <B>America's
    Dairyland, 1989 </B>(actually filmed in Wisconsin, so the opening 
   crawl is true)<B>:</B> A father and his son Andy (Brady Cohen) are 
   driving down the road when they pass a long-haired, bandana-wearing 
   hitch-hiker carrying a backpack and a plastic jug of water. The 
   camera switches to the hitch-hiker, as he walks down the road and 
   then into the forest, where he spots an abandoned chemical factory 
   and decides to spend the night there (It is in real-life a no-longer-on-use
    glue factory that was cleaned out and Rosas had to get the owner's 
   permission to film there when cops caught him scouting-out the place. 
   Luckily he got permission, because the building is a character unto 
   itself.). The hitch-hiker scopes out the place, which is large and 
   empty, so he decides to stay there for the night, breaks a wooden 
   chair and builds a small fire inside to keep him warm when he sleeps. 
   Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Just as he is eating a can of beans he cooked 
   over the fire, a creature (Andrew Swant) wearing a gas mask (the kind 
   with a long tube that juts-out the mouth area) suddenly attacks him 
   and drags him away screaming. We then see Andy watching TV , as he 
   switches channels and we can spot scenes from <B><A HREF="night_of_the_living_dead_1968.htm">NIGHT
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> (1968) and <B><A HREF="nosferatu_1922.htm">NOSFERATU</A></B> 
   (1922; pay close attention to what Andy is watching before he starts 
   switching channels). We then see Rachel (Emily Treolo) getting 
   dressed in 80's workout gear (It must be mentioned that the stunt 
   boobs were supplied by Kelly Cunningham), which includes a leotard 
   and head and wristbands and watches and exercises to a workout VHS 
   tape hosted by Billy The Butt (Bobby Ciraldo). Andy is all alone in 
   the house, when his sister Laura (Sarah Luther) comes in and reads a 
   note from her parents, saying they are going away for the weekend and 
   want Laura to take care of Andy for the weekend. They also leave 
   $35.00 on the counter, so Laura calls up best friend Rachel and wants 
   to know how much booze $35.00 will buy. Rachel stops her workout 
   routine and says she'll be right over. We then see Craig (Nick 
   Sommer) waking up his best friend Teddy (Mike Johnson) and try to 
   think of something to do for the weekend, but first Craig hits on 
   Teddy's mom (Carrie Hitchcock), who warns Craig that one day she may 
   take him up on his offer (and she probably would!). Craig is a 
   wise-ass, but he is harmless; just your typical 80's teenage best 
   friend. Laura and Rachel go to the local liquor store and Rachel uses 
   her sexy charms on nerdy clerk Wade (Ryan Plato) to buy some alcohol, 
   even though they are both underage. It works and as they are walking 
   out the liquor store carrying bottles of booze, Craig approaches them 
   after seeing Rachel at work with Wade. Craig and Teddy invite them to 
   a camping party, but Laura has to watch Andy for the weekend. Rachel 
   convinces Laura to bring her little brother with them because she 
   thinks the guys are cute. Laura agrees and she and Rachel head for 
   Laura's house. (Craig makes fun of Wade, saying he will never get 
   laid and makes him smell his finger!). When Laura gets home, Andy is 
   outside burning ants with a magnifying glass and she bribes him $5.00 
   to come with them to the camping party and makes sure Andy has his 
   lies down straight should their parents ask him what they did for the 
   weekend. Craig and Teddy pull up to Laura's house in a paneled 
   station wagon. Craig makes a wise-ass remark and Laura shoots back, 
   &quot;Hey, my Grandmother has a car just like that!&quot; They all 
   drive to the abandoned Rocky Trails Campgrounds, where there are 
   still buildings standing, but the quartet decide to set up tents and 
   camp outside instead (Going to a campground is never a good idea in 
   the 80's. Especially if it is deserted.). Just like every 80's horror 
   flick that takes place in the woods, they all sit around a campfire 
   at night and Craig tell a story about a local horror legend (We all 
   know that legends are usually based on facts blown out of 
   proportion). Craig tells everyone about a &quot;man-beast&quot; who 
   would suck the blood out of the local livestock. He would just take 
   enough blood to leave the livestock alive so it could return later 
   and repeat the procedure. This man-beast is supposed to be the 
   missing night guard at the nearby the chemical plant (the one we saw 
   the hitch-hiker in), where there was a horrible chemical accident 
   decades earlier and the night guard's body was never found. Could 
   that be the gas mask creature we saw attacking the hitch-hiker? Teddy 
   and Rachel take a hike to the Rocky Trails Headquarters, which is 
   still standing. Rachel discovers a newspaper dated &quot;Nov. 
   1956&quot; (funny how no day is mentioned) which tells the complete 
   story about the deadly chemical plant accident where a body was never 
   found (terrific editing by Rosas here). They leave the building 
   because Rachel becomes freaked out. Craig passes out drunk on Laura, 
   while Teddy and Rachel make love (Teddy tells Craig the next day that 
   he got to &quot;third base&quot;) in the back of the station wagon 
   (Kelly Cunningham's stunt boobs again). Morning comes and Andy goes 
   on a short hike of his own, fashioning a spear with a stick and a pen 
   knife and impaling a frog on it (how it was done without actually 
   hurting the frog can be read on IMDb). He hears Laura call for him, 
   so he throws the bloody spear away and goes back to camp (Andy has a 
   unique obsession with death.). Craig is still passed-out drunk and 
   Teddy is still worn-out, so Rachel, Laura &amp; Andy go on a hike on 
   their own and find the abandoned chemical plant. They all go inside 
   and see how immense it is, but Laura is &quot;creeped-out&quot; and 
   leaves to go back to the campsite with Andy, while Rachel stays 
   behind to take photos inside with her Instamatic camera. Well, I 
   guess we know who the next victim is. Rachel walks through the 
   darkness and is attacked by the gas mask-wearing creature. We hear 
   her screams, as Laura and Andy make it back to the camp and Craig and 
   Teddy decide to go looking for Rachel (Laura wants them to leave the 
   car keys with her, so Craig hands them over, making another wise-ass 
   remark about Laura stealing the car). Laura wants to go for a swim, 
   so before the guys leave the camp, Craig climbs a tree to watch Laura 
   strip to put her bathing suit on (My God, she has the hairiest bush I 
   have ever seen in a movie! I wonder if Kelly Cunningham was the 
   &quot;stunt bush&quot; in this film, too?). The guys then leave and 
   make it to the abandoned chemical factory, go inside and yell for 
   Rachel (&quot;This place is dead!&quot;), but the gas mask creature 
   is actually at the campsite attacking Laura. Andy buries a machete 
   into the<A HREF="rocky_trails_2010.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rocky trails aka blood junkie poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="194" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   creature's back and Laura and Andy get into the car, but the creature 
   pulls Laura out of the driver side window and injects the back of her 
   neck with something in a hypodermic needle. While the gas mask 
   creature has Laura tied up and is taking her by wheelbarrow back to 
   the chemical plant, Laura's eyeglasses slip off and fall to the 
   ground. Andy follows the creature, while Teddy finds an empty 
   hypodermic needle on the floor of the factory and Craig says, 
   &quot;Junkies, man...junkies!&quot;. They leave the abandoned factory 
   and, while walking back, Teddy finds Laura's eyeglasses and Craig 
   says she can't see a thing without them, so they head back to the 
   chemical plant after discovering that the station wagon is damaged. 
   I'll leave the final 15 minutes for you to discover because it is too 
   good and unexpected to give away. I had to watch the film twice to 
   get all the subtle clues, because never in a million years will you 
   guess the ending.&nbsp; Both of director/producer/screenwriter/editor 
   (and about a half dozen other duties behind the camera) Drew Rosas' 
   films have terrific surprise endings, which makes me want to call him 
   the &quot;Low-budget M. Night Shyamalan&quot;, but only in 
   Shyamalan's early career. Rosas does a great job giving the film that 
   80's vibe (especially the music, which Rosas also contributed to), as 
   the guys wear acid-washed jeans or those short-shorts that show your 
   balls, play games on an Atari 2600 gaming system, both Craig and 
   Teddy sport those half-full mustaches that were so popular back then 
   (unlike those thick 70's porn mustaches), have Winger and a &quot;Rock
    Or Die&quot; posters on Teddy's bedroom wall and one of them dons a 
   Ronald Reagan mask during an 80's montage sequence (one of the most 
   over-used techniques in 80's films of all kinds and Rosas edits it 
   perfectly). Not to mention the awful hairstyles from both sexes of 
   the period. If you are old enough, you will be impressed how well 
   Rosas nails the period (especially how important VHS and music 
   cassettes were in our daily lives). It's one of the best 80's films 
   made in the New Millennium. The blood and gore doesn't kick-in until 
   the final 15 minutes and some of the stuff goes way beyond R-Rated 
   material (and it's all physical), but I'm not going to give anything 
   away (Except to say that the hose on the gas mask is used for more 
   than just breathing). The gas mask killer actually does have a valid 
   reason for being in this film, but like I said before, I'll leave it 
   for you to discover. And once you do discover it, you will be asking 
   yourself all sorts of questions. Very valid questions. A great way to 
   spend 72 minutes of your life, once you get past the idiotic Lloyd 
   Kaufman opening. Many of the actors in this film (including a 
   fully-clothed Kelly Cunningham) would later appear in Drew Rosas' <B><A HREF="billy_club_2014.htm">BILLY
    CLUB</A></B> (2014; co-directed by this film's star Nick Sommer), 
   another film that has that 80's atmosphere. I hope he doesn't wait 
   four years between films. This guy has more than enough talent to 
   spare and all of the actors are fantastic. You'll actually think 
   you're back in the 80's if you lived through it. And man, that 
   ending! Also featuring Anne Killelea, Chris Chuzles as the 
   hitch-hiker and TJ Richter as the face of the creature without the 
   gas mask. A <A HREF="http://www.troma.com">Troma Entertainment</A>

    OF GHASTLY HORROR</A><A NAME="BloodGhastHorror67"></A> (1964 - 1967) -</B> 
   Technically, this was director/producer Al Adamson's first film, 
   originally made as a criminal heist film with actor Roy Morton (his 
   only other acting credit is as a rapist in the 1972 film <B><A HREF="fuzz_1972.htm">FUZZ</A></B>)
    as the star, but he and friend Samuel M. Sherman (who were yet to 
   form Independent International Pictures) were unable to sell it to 
   any distributor. The next year, Adamson added scenes (with John 
   Carradine), changing the film into a science fiction flick and called 
   in <B><A HREF="psycho_a_go_go_1965.htm">PSYCHO A GO-GO</A></B> 
   (1965), but he and Sherman were still unable to get any distributor 
   interested in it. A couple of years later, Allied Artists approached 
   Adamson and Sherman to see if they had any color horror films to 
   purchase for a package being sold to TV, so Adamsom shot still more 
   footage to the film (adding Tommy Kirk, Regina Carrol and Kent Taylor 
   to the cast), making it a zombie/mad scientist film and sold it to 
   Allied Artists under the title <B><A HREF="man_with_the_synthetic_brain_1964-1967.htm">THE

    OF GHASTLY HORROR</A></B> (1967), where it had a very limited 
   theatrical release in 1967 and then a much wider theatrical release 
   in 1971 (Actually<A HREF="blood_of_ghastly_horror_1967.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blood of ghastly horror dvd8 front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="207" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   early January of 1972, but the copyright on the film under the title 
   was listed as 1971. Sherman was anal about making sure none of his 
   films fell into Public Domain and always re-registered their 
   copyrights. He still owns most of the films today and makes money off 
   them. More small budget label owners during this time period should 
   have followed Sherman's lead. They would have a lot more money in 
   their pockets today!). It was usually paired with Adamson's piecemeal 
   film <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HorrorBloodMonst70">HORROR OF THE 
   BLOOD MONSTERS</A></B> (1965/1970) and was a financial success for 
   both Adamson and Sherman. I went into this film with more than a 
   little trepidation, but it is is rather interesting and entertaining 
   considering its history.&nbsp; Since this is a Troma DVD, I expected 
   the usual lousy unfunny videotaped cold opening by Lloyd Kaufman (who 
   always looked like he is reading the information off cue cards for 
   the first time), but this one actually opens with Sam Sherman 
   dragging two plastic bags, which he says are the body parts of 
   critics who hated the film. He then goes into a short, funny history 
   (He tells us not to fall asleep for five minutes, because when we 
   wake up, we will think another film is playing!) of the making of the 
   film (he says the first incarnation was a hit in Pakistan!) and the 
   movie begins (Sherman also does a feature-length commentary track, so 
   you can learn all you need to know about this film and Sherman's life 
   as a film distributor). Since this is a Troma DVD, the print is in 
   fullscreen (but it looks excellent, especially coming from Troma) and 
   we see a facially-deformed zombie named Akro (Richard Smedley; 
   Adamson's <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BrainOfBlood1971">BRAIN OF BLOOD</A></B> 
   - 1971), killing a prostitute, her john and two police detectives by 
   crushing their necks with his strong hands and arms (Akro does 
   something to the last detective's body offscreen and we will soon 
   learn what it is). The Police Commissioner calls Sgt. Cross (Tommy 
   Kirk; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#StreetsOfDeath1987">STREETS OF </A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#StreetsOfDeath1987">DEATH</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"> 
   - 1987) and wants these murders (there were more before the film 
   began) solved immediately. Sgt. Cross then gets a package addressed 
   to him at police headquarters and when he opens it up, there is the 
   decapitated head of the last murdered detective inside (he was Sgt. 
   Cross' friend) and also a note (each letter pasted from a headline in 
   a newspaper), which says &quot;All Will Die For Corey&quot;. Sgt. 
   Cross remembers the Corey case, where Joe Corey (Roy Morton) returned 
   from Vietnam almost brain dead with a shell fragment lodged in his 
   cranium. Dr. Howard Vernard (John Carradine) operated on Corey, but 
   he said he could not save him, declaring him dead and signing his 
   death certificate (Don't you believe it!). We then go to the 1964 
   footage, where Joe Corey and two associates rob a half million 
   dollars in a jewel heist (They are dressed in medical garb with 
   surgical masks hiding their faces). After changing into civilian 
   clothes in a closet, they take the elevator down to the first floor, 
   but before they are able to make it, one of the tied-up female 
   workers hits the alarm button and one of the gang members panics, 
   goes to a roof and throws the case carrying the jewels into the back 
   of a white pickup truck owned by construction worker David Clarke 
   (Kirk Duncan; <B><A HREF="seconds_1966.htm">SECONDS</A></B> - 1966), 
   before a cop shoots him. Corey comes through the door, knocks out the 
   cop and shoots his partner dead, laughing maniacally. David gets in 
   his truck and unknowingly drives away with the loot; a woman in 
   another car following him home (she's not the getaway driver because 
   we see Corey and the other member get picked up in a van). Lt. Frank 
   Ward (Joey Benson; <B><A HREF="gallery_of_horrors_1967.htm">GALLERY 
   OF HORROR</A></B> - 1967) pays Dr. Vanard a visit, because he signed 
   Corey's death certificate, but his prints are all over the crime 
   scene. For reasons only known to Adamson and Sherman, Corey kills a 
   secretary working at David's construction company with a letter 
   opener so he can get David's address. Corey and his gang drive to 
   David's home (Including the woman we saw following David home. 
   Couldn't she have simply given Corey the address rather than him kill 
   an innocent person? The mind boggles.), where Corey beats the crap 
   out of David asking him where the half-million in jewels are. David 
   has no idea what they are talking about, so Corey discovers that 
   David has a divorced wife named Linda (Tracy Robbins) and a young 
   daughter named Nancy (K.K. Riddle) and go looking for them (Nancy saw 
   the bag of jewels when her father drove home). Lt. Ward return to Dr. 
   Vanard's office when Vanard calls him and says he needs to see him. 
   He tells Ward that he built an artificial component to replace the 
   part that was damaged in Joe Corey's brain, but it turned him into a 
   psychopathic killer with no sense of right or wrong. Lt. Ward calls 
   Dr. Vanard the killer and tells him that he will be returning to 
   arrest him after he gets charges from the District Attorney. Joe 
   Corey goes to the lounge where Linda works as a singer, but the bar 
   floozy says Linda and her daughter took the bus to Lake Tahoe for a 
   short vacation. Corey strangles the bar floozy in her apartment just 
   for shits and giggles (&quot;So long, honey!&quot;). Corey then 
   visits Dr. Vanard, straps him vertically to a table, puts a metal cap 
   on his head and electrocutes him until his whole lab explodes (this 
   is the last of the 1965 footage). We are now back to the 1967 
   footage, where Sgt. Cross says there is only one person still left 
   alive in the Joe Corey case: him. He is paid a visit by Dr. Vanard's 
   daughter, Susan (Regina Carrol; Adamson's <B><A HREF="female_bunch_1969_piranha_piranha_1972_tarzana_the_wild_girl_1971_dvd.htm">THE
    FEMALE BUNCH</A></B> - 1971; she was Adamson's wife from 1972 until 
   she died of cancer in 1992 at 49 years-old; Barney Gelfan, who 
   appears as a detective in this, and appears in many other Adamson 
   films, was her father), who says she flew in from France because she 
   is a psychic and some kind of telepathic force has sent her here. It 
   seems Joe Corey has a father, Dr. Elton Corey (Kent Taylor; Adamson's <B><A HREF="girls_for_rent_1974.htm">GIRLS
    FOR RENT</A></B> - 1974; his last film), who is a master of voodoo 
   and created Akro to get rid of all those responsible for his son's 
   death. Susan is his next intended &quot;victim&quot; and she gets a 
   message to meet Dr. Corey, so she phones the police department and 
   tells Sgt. Pete Grimaldi (Arne Warde; Adamson's <B><A HREF="angels_wild_women_1972.htm">ANGELS'
    WILD WOMEN</A></B> - 1972) where she is going to be. Dr. Corey 
   kidnaps Susan and when Pete gets there, Akro kills him, even after 
   Pete empties his gun into him. Before he dies, Pete is able to write 
   a license plate number on the pavement using his own blood and Sgt. 
   Cross follows up on it. Dr. Corey plans on turning Susan into his 
   newest zombie (&quot;Joe's last days were spent as a hunted mad 
   animal!&quot;) because he says that Akro is deteriorating and will 
   not last much longer. Dr. Corey has a serum to turn people into 
   zombies and an antidote to change them back to normal. We then go 
   back to the 1964 footage, where Joe Corey is in Lake Tahoe, but he 
   doesn't know &quot;the entire police force from California to 
   Nevada&quot; are looking for him (Well, that is true, if Lt. Ward and 
   Linda's ex-husband David can be considered the &quot;entire police 
   force&quot;). Linda and Nancy are taken hostage by Corey and his 
   partner, but Linda swears she knows nothing about stolen jewels. That 
   just leaves one other person: Nancy, who has stuffed all the jewels 
   in her doll (which, in a very unusual twist for 1964, is black). When 
   Corey tries to rape Linda, his partner intervenes, but Corey shoots 
   him in the heart. Linda and Nancy (with her doll) steal Corey's car 
   and drive away, so Corey carjacks a vehicle on the highway and begins 
   to follow them. Linda and Nancy are forced to hoof in in the snow 
   when the road is blocked, with Corey not far behind. Lt. Ward and 
   David show up where the cars are parked and try to catch up with 
   Corey and the couple. Just as Corey is about to kill Linda and Nancy 
   and steal the doll, Lt. Ward and David show up. Corey is about to 
   crush David's head with a rock when Lt. Ward shoots Corey in the face 
   and he falls down a ravine. Back in 1967, a detective breaks into Dr. 
   Corey's lab, but Akro kills him. <A HREF="blood_of_ghastly_horror_1964-1967b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blood of ghastly horror poster14 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Dr.
    Corey injects Susan with the zombie serum and she turns into a 
   horribly disfigured hag zombie with a fright wig. Akro, who knows he 
   is dying, crushes Dr. Corey to death, but while doing so, breaks the 
   vial containing to only available antidote (Akro is seen on the 
   ground licking the spilled liquid). When Sgt. Cross finally arrives, 
   everyone but Susan is dead, but now she looks normal (Huh?). The 
   incomprehensible finale shows blood dripping on Dr. Corey's photo, 
   while Sgt. Cross calls for backup. THE END.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's obvious 
   that Al Adamson used different film stock for every scene he added 
   over the years, but for a piecemeal film, it makes more sense than 
   others (The head-scratching finale excluded). You will also notice 
   the changes in clothing and hair styles from year-to-year (Roy Morton 
   sports a flattop haircut, which was popular among men in the early 
   60's and other women sport beehive hairdos). While there are plot 
   holes aplenty (name me an Adamson film that doesn't; the screenplay 
   for this stitched-togethered film was written by Dick Poston [<B><A HREF="jesus_trip_1971.htm">THE
    JESUS TRIP</A></B> - 1971] and Chris Martino [the film's uncredited 
   Second Unit Director] from a story by Adamson and Sherman), there's 
   an air of sleaziness that permeates the film, something unusual for a 
   film of this vintage(s). Besides the head in the box. the secretary's 
   stabbing and Joe Corey getting shot in the face (all shot for the 
   theatrical version), the film is practically bloodless, but you'll 
   have fun spotting which footage was shot in each year (Cinematography 
   by Louis Horvath [<B><A HREF="strange_behavior_1981.htm">STRANGE BEHAVIOR</A></B>

    ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND</A></B> - 1977]). I'm not saying that 
   this is a good film because it isn't, but its production history 
   should make it must-viewing for people to learn on how to never give 
   up. Sooner or later your work will be shown. Every version of this 
   film, except for the complete 1964 version, has been released on home 
   video, each one of them with a different plot. Stick with the final 
   version. It offers more blood than the other versions. I consider Al 
   Adamson to be a trash filmmaker, but he owned it and was proud to 
   keep churning them out until there was no longer a demand for them. 
   He made films in nearly every genre (biker, horror, science fiction, 
   Westerns, comedy, action, etc) and, while they are nothing 
   extraordinary, Al Adamson was. His career and murder would make a 
   great film in the vein of <B><A HREF="ed_wood_1994.htm">ED WOOD</A></B>

   any family that will miss them and if anyone knows they are here. 
   There is also a weird robot-like structure in the middle of the 
   living room, which Nina wants them to ignore, but Antonio seems very 
   proud of. Antonio, who wears outrageously large bowties (a good gust 
   of wind could send him airborne!), is an inventor, hoping to create 
   the &quot;perfect man&quot; and his laboratory is full of strange 
   inventions, which seem to meld human body parts with mechanical 
   devices, forming one unit. It is clear that Antonio is off his 
   rocker, but is there more to him than meets the eye?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    That night, all of them retire to their bedrooms, where Max and his 
   girlfriend smoke some hashish and get frisky with each other, when 
   the drunk enters their bedroom unannounced and says that everyone in 
   this house is strange (he isn't kidding!). Max goes to the hallway to 
   investigate and spots the Gypsy tied up in her bed, Alfiero telling 
   him it is for her own benefit, as she is an epileptic and doesn't 
   want her to harm herself (really?). The next morning, Nina and 
   Alfiero tell the guests (except for the Gypsy, who isn't there, Nina 
   telling them she left the night before) to go through a strange door, 
   shaped like a large vagina (!) and they go through it (I almost 
   busted a gut laughing!) and end up in a room full of distorted 
   mirrors. Music begins to play and everyone begins dancing. Max, his 
   girlfriend and the prostitute open a bottle of champagne and then 
   begin to strip naked, while Nina Alfiero watch and Antonio fondles 
   the prostitute's naked body. It's obvious that the champagne was 
   drugged, because Max, his girlfriend and the prostitute pass out. Max 
   and his lover wake up to a scream and discover that the Drunk is now 
   missing. Max's squeeze notices that the robot-like structure was 
   missing from the living room the night before, but now it is back, 
   blood on one of its metal claw-like arms.&nbsp; Max and his 
   girlfriend want to leave the house, but all the doors and windows are 
   locked, so they go down the spiral metal staircase to the basement to 
   look for another way out. Max discovers plenty of empty wine bottles 
   and discovers one of the bottles has the red blood-like substance, 
   sniffing it and telling his girlfriend it is an &quot;organic 
   substance&quot;. They search the basement and find a closet full of 
   canned tomatoes and discover Alfiero closing boxes of wine rather 
   than opening them. Thinking something sinister is going on, they try 
   to escape and find a walk-in freezer full of dead naked bodies, 
   including that of the Gypsy and the Drunk. Alfiero enters the freezer 
   carrying an assault rifle and escorts the couple out of the basement. 
   Meanwhile, the UNESCO Agent gets closer to discovering the truth, 
   questioning a wine truck driver who gives him an important clue about 
   Dr. Antonio Genovese.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While Max and his girlfriend watch, we then see the prostitute tied 
   naked to a table, while Antonio examines her, saying to Nina and 
   Alfiero, &quot;Group 'A' is the most common, but the girl is a 'B'. 
   Very rare!&quot; The prostitute thinks it's going to be a gangbang, 
   but she has a surprise coming. A deadly surprise. The giant 
   robot-like structure enters the room under Antonio's control, its 
   tentacle-like arm impaling the prostitute's neck and begins draining 
   her of all her blood, which is collected in a glass jar, killing her 
   slowly. The prostitute looks to Max and his girlfriend for help, but 
   they can do nothing, as they watch her skin turn to ashen gray and 
   the table then opens up and lowers her body into the basement 
   freezer, another victim of the trio's deadly business. But what is it?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Max, who for some unknown reason begins talking in English (!), 
   screams out to Nina, Alfiero and Antonio, &quot;You're crazy! 
   Crazy!&quot; Nina then says that the &quot;wine&quot; will leave on 
   their yacht as planned, the destinations being the Orient, Vietnam, 
   Bolivia and &quot;Wherever there are wars and injured people. Blood 
   is worth a lot. More than oil or gold. And it's needed to save the 
   lives of those who can afford it.&quot; That's right, Nina collects 
   &quot;worthless people&quot;; prostitutes, drunks, gypsies and 
   drifters and has Antonio drain them of their blood using his unique 
   invention, selling their blood to the highest bidders (I think this 
   is the first time I ever heard of this. Human organs, yes, but 
   blood???). Max then screams out, &quot;Fuckin' Fascists!&quot; and is 
   knocked out.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Max's girlfriend is the next to be drained of blood, but the UNESCO 
   Agent rings the doorbell and shoots and kills Alfiero. Nina tells 
   Antonio that she should have killed him, when the robot kills her 
   seemingly on its own, without Antonio's help. Maybe he actually did 
   merge man and machine after all, but he'll never be able to enjoy it 
   in prison, as he tells the Agent, &quot;Mortality is a myth of the 
   past!&quot; The film ends with Max and <A HREF="bloodstained_lawn_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bloodstained lawn italy dvd front4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="226" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>his

    They don't get much stranger than this folks (the Drunk tries to 
   drink his booze through his eye!). If you are wondering the meaning 
   of the film's title, it comes early in the film when Max and his 
   squeeze are hitchhiking. His girlfriend notices a field of beautiful 
   red flowers and Max turns to her and says, &quot;It looks like a 
   bloodstained lawn.&quot; This film is full of symbolism, especially 
   Antonio's laboratory, where we see all his strange inventions, most 
   of them dealing with the merging of human appendages with mechanical 
   devices. I really don't know what was on director/screenwriter 
   Riccardo Ghione's mind, but I'm sure it's a political statement about 
   how those with money feel they are superior to those without it or 
   how the aristocracy is more important than the common people, using 
   them to feed their own corrupt souls. It should come as no surprise 
   that none of the captives, besides Max, are given proper names, as 
   they represent the &quot;common people' (although we do learn later 
   in the film that the Gypsy's name was &quot;Venamina&quot;). Ghione 
   (who passed away in 2003) only directed four features, the others 
   being sex comedies or romantic dramas, none of them even coming close 
   to this film's weirdness. And, boy, is this film weird! From the 
   vagina door to the bedrooms with windows in the doors, you will not 
   see a stranger house in film history. Every room tells a story, some 
   overt and some deeply hidden. Couple that with the weird robot on 
   view and you have a film that is recommended to those with an open 
   mind. Chock full of full frontal male and female nudity, with a 
   smattering of bloody violence, this film is bound to please those who 
   want something strange and perverse to watch for a night. The only 
   other film of note Ghione was involved with is the obscure <B><A HREF="belle_da_morire_1992.htm">BELLE

   (2009) and others so obscure, they don't even have an <A HREF="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</A> 
   listing. There's a good reason for that. Many people find Murphy's 
   films so sloppy and slow-moving (not to mention cheap) that they 
   could tax the patience of a dead man. While I somewhat tend to agree 
   with that assessment, Murphy does show a spot of intelligence and 
   downright meanness every now and then. <B>BLOODSTREAM</B> opens 
   interestingly enough, with a screaming man jumping out of his car and 
   running through the woods while the flesh peels away from his body, 
   eventually turning him into a bloody skeleton. It is then revealed 
   that it's a VHS tape being watched at the office of B-movie czar 
   William King (Mark Wells) and he's not happy with the results. He 
   rips up the tape and fires the film's director, Alistair (Patrick 
   Olliver), telling him he will never work in the film business again, 
   before having him thrown out of the office by King's yes-man (and 
   brother-in-law) Simon (Steven Longhurst). In reality, King (whose 
   office walls are plastered with posters of his reel-life films, with 
   titles such as <B>SUCKED TO DEATH</B> and <B>AWAKEN ZOMBIE</B>) 
   really likes Alistair's film, but he<A HREF="bloodstream_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bloodstream 1985 title screen small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="252" HEIGHT="173" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   is such a greedy bastard that he wants to keep the film's eventual 
   profits all to himself. A dejected Alistair goes home and watches a 
   series of horror films (possibly his own?) on TV where people are 
   torn apart by zombies, axed in the head by a masked serial killer or 
   have their head crushed by a mummy. While King is making a fortune 
   selling rights to Alistair's film <B>BLOODSTREAM</B> around the 
   world, Alistair snaps when he is informed by King's guilt-ridden 
   secretary Nikki (Jacqueline Logan) as to what King is up to. With 
   Nikki's help on the inside, Alistair begins his revenge spree, using 
   the killings in the horror films he watches as a blueprint for his 
   real-life murders. Dressed as the Grim Reaper, Alistair films his 
   murders, beginning with actor Greg (David Slater), who has a barbell 
   dropped on his neck (after dropping a 20 pound weight on his balls!). 
   King's daughter Lisa (Samantha Page) is next, electrocuted in her 
   bathtub and then stabbed with a sword. Simon is next in line, shot 
   with a pistol and getting his hand and head cut off with an electric 
   chainsaw (In a tasteless sequence, Simon's dog is tied to a tree, 
   doused with gasoline and set on fire.). King's wife, Sally (Wendy 
   Young), then has her throat cut with an electric knife. King's 
   mistress, Judy (Catherine Rowlands), is tied to a chair and stabbed 
   in the mouth with a butcher knife. King is then forced to watch 
   Alistair's newest film, containing all the bloody deaths of his 
   friends and family, before having his brains blown out with a pistol 
   and making it look like a suicide. When Alistair finds out Nikki was 
   only in it for the money, he kills her, too (by strangling her with a 
   reel of film) and ends up in the insane asylum. Hooray for the 
   British justice system!&nbsp; Since this is a super 8mm production, 
   expect all the usual problems, including garbled sound recording (all 
   the dialogue is recorded live with no post-production looping), 
   chainsaw editing (sequences jump from one scene to the next, with 
   visible splice marks and jumps in sound) and plenty of bad acting. 
   Director Murphy and screenwriter Carl Humphries (who also wrote 
   Murphy's <B>INVITATION TO HELL</B>) spend way too much time on the 
   buildup (Alistair spends 75% of his screen time watching horrible 
   horror films on his TV; films so cheap-looking, Andy Milligan would 
   have probably turned them off) and not enough time on the payoff. 
   While there is plenty of bloody violence, both within the film clips 
   Alistair watches and the murders he performs, none of it is very well 
   done or believable. There's not much to recommend here (although 
   Murphy has a way displaying the nastier edges of people) unless you 
   are a fan of ultra-cheap horror flicks where nearly every aspect of 
   the production is lower-rung, both financially and professionally. 
   Also starring Nanda Adkin, Lindsey Allen, Marina Bolton, Michael Clay 
   and Dennis Daniels. Never legitimately available on home video in the 
   United States (or, apparently, anywhere else); the print I viewed was 
   sourced from an obscure bootleg British VHS tape. Sarcophilous Films,

    of spirits, in order to celebrate the birthday of the Demon King, 
   they use their blood and change it to a Bloody Parrot. If you have 
   the luck to meet it, it'll offer you three wishes to fulfill whatever 
   you want.&quot; (It sounds like the old &quot;rubbing the lamp and 
   magic genie&quot; story, only with blood mixed into the equation.). 
   When thirteen caskets of treasures to the King of Dian, used to pay 
   tribute to the Imperial Court, are stolen, the Prince sends Chief Guo 
   Fan (Kuan Feng) to investigate. The Chief and his men are attacked by 
   an invisible enemy and the Chief sets his eyes upon the Bloody Parrot 
   (the sky turns blood red), who tells him he now has three wishes and 
   as long as he lives, the wishes will come true. As we have learned 
   from other wishing stories and films, you better be careful what you 
   wish for. Being the good policeman that he is, the Chief's first wish 
   is to find the thirteen caskets of treasure and, poof!, the treasures 
   are returned to the Prince, but Chief Guo Fan, also the Prince's son, 
   dies after falling off his horse when returning to the Dian home. The 
   distraught Prince begs the Bloody Parrot to bring his son back to 
   life and almost gets his wish, except his sister, the Princess, goes 
   bonkers, stabs the Prince in the back with a sword and the commits 
   suicide with the same sword. Their father, the King, dies of a heart 
   attack a few seconds later. (Remember this scene. It is an important 
   clue.). The thirteen caskets of treasure once again disappears, which 
   causes a bloody upheaval in the Dian Dynasty, as all the martial 
   artists across the land fight each other to the death looking to meet 
   the Bloody Parrot and get their hands on the treasure. Enter 
   Constable Yeh Ting Feng (Jason Pai Piao; <B><A HREF="#BloodySorcery1986">BLOODY
    SORCERY</A></B> - 1986), who is searching for Chief Guo Fan's 
   brother, Guo Kan, the only surviving member of the Dian family who 
   may know where the lost treasure is located. He meets Guo Kan for a 
   few moments when he pops-up out of a casket at the now-deserted Dian 
   house and tells Yeh Ting that the red streak he just saw dart across 
   the sky means that the Bloody Parrot will soon visit. Guo Kan then 
   suddenly drops dead and Yeh Ting has an autopsy performed on him 
   (it's disgusting as hell and leaves very little to the imagination), 
   only to find he was killed by a poison needle and that he has a huge 
   pearl, part of the lost treasure, embedded in one of his legs. Yeh 
   Ting joins forces with friend (and local lawman) Tieh Han (Tony Liu 
   Yung; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#HumanLanterns">HUMAN LANTERNS</A></B> - 
   1982) to find Guo Kan's killer, but the Bloody Parrot kills Tieh Han 
   before they even begin to investigate. While at a bar mourning the 
   death of his friend (he's brought Tieh's coffin with him!), Yeh Ting 
   is attacked by three troublemakers, but the Bloody Parrot makes 
   another quick appearance, killing the three goons (and a real parrot 
   perched at the bar!) with it's supposed supernatural powers and 
   leaving a few more pieces of the lost treasure, including a Bloody 
   Rock, for Yeh Ting to find. The bartender gives Yeh Ting a clue, 
   which leads him to the aptly titled Parrot Brothel, with Tieh's 
   coffin in tow. Everyone at the brothel thinks Yeh Ting is a nutcase 
   (Who travels with a coffin?), but prostitute Xue Nu (Jenny Liang 
   Chen-Ni; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#LostSouls1980">LOST SOULS</A></B>

    that there is more to the Bloody Parrot legend than meets the eye. 
   Xue Nu then grabs the Bloody Rock and swallows it! She becomes 
   possessed by the Demon King (she begins licking her own naked breasts 
   like they were made of candy!), shoves a huge pearl up her vagina and 
   begins attacking Yeh Ting, until he hits her so hard that the pearl 
   falls out of her twat! Folks, I've barely touched upon the insanity 
   on view here (everything I have described happens within the first 
   thirty minutes!), as Yeh Ting will encounter a hunchback servant, a 
   vengeful witch named Madame Li (Mei-Mei Wong), a fighter with an 
   extremely long sword and Constable Chang Xiao, The Deadly Sword, who 
   may be a better martial artist than Yeh Ting. He will also have to 
   deal with his friend Tieh rising from his coffin and turning into a 
   vampire (he bites a priest on the hand, forcing the priest to cut off 
   his own arm with a sword!). This all leads to a finale that proves 
   that the Bloody Parrot was nothing but a royal scam, a way for the 
   Prince and Princess (who faked their deaths with a trick sword) to 
   keep the treasure all to themselves. But Yeh Ting still has one or 
   two tricks up his sleeve to defeat this nasty duo.&nbsp; I've barely

   son of Sau Au Yeung, who offers to help, but Mak Long runs away 
   (leaving a rather large puddle of blood in his wake). Next, while 
   having dinner in a restaurant, his plate of noodles turns into a pile 
   of worms, which he unknowingly ingests in front of shocked customers 
   while his leg still hemorrhages blood (One customer yells at him, 
   &quot;You bleed too much!&quot;). While Dr. Au Yeung is driving home, 
   he spots Mak Long passed-out on the side of the road, so he brings 
   him to the hospital, where he patches up his leg wound, but thinks 
   the injury is something he has seen before. Nurse Suk Fan (Jo Jo Ngan 
   Lai-Yue) believes Mak Long was shot and wants to report him to the 
   police, but when his x-rays come back and show no signs of a leg 
   wound at all, Dr. Au Yeung decides that the police aren't the answer 
   and launches his own investigation. When Mak Long wakes up in the 
   hospital (just after his room fills up with blood, worms fall out of 
   his leg wound and then everything disappears in a flash of white<A HREF="blood_sorcery_1986c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blood sorcery japan vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="193" HEIGHT="321" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   light), he tells Dr. Au Yeung and Suk Fan the whole sordid story. 
   Flashbacks reveal that Mak Long was a reporter in Vietnam during the 
   war, where he photographed and documented all types of atrocities 
   with his camera. While on leave in Thailand, he meets a Burmese bar 
   girl named Lina (Fung Git-Ling) and they fall in love, unaware that 
   Lina's father is a powerful wizard. When Mak Long promises to come 
   back from Vietnam to marry Lina and then breaks that promise (Turns 
   out that Mak Long is a womanizer and already has a wife in Hong 
   Kong), Lina's father puts a magic curse on him, which turns his life 
   to shit.&nbsp; I know what you're thinking: &quot;Wait a minute!&nbsp;
    What does this have to do with the jade statue and Dr. Au Yeung's 
   father?&quot; Well, it turns out that the wheelchair-bound Sau Au 
   Yeung and Mak Long have one important thing in common: The leader of 
   the angry native tribe and Lina's father are one and the same! Can 
   Dr. Au Yeung save his father and Mak Long from the vengeful wizard's 
   wrath, which includes vampire demons, even more disgusting worms and 
   lots of supernatural mumbo jumbo (not to mention matching gaping leg 
   wounds)? I'm afraid you'll have to watch the film to find out. This 
   lunatic horror flick, directed and written by Do Gong-Yue (<B><A HREF="devil_sorcery_1988.htm">DEVIL
    SORCERY</A></B> - 1988; <B><A HREF="ladies_killer_1992.htm">LADIES KILLER</A></B> 
   - 1992), is full of the type of bloody nonsense we've come to expect 
   from Hong Kong horror films. There's plenty of shots of bloody leg 
   wounds oozing worms; showers of blood (including a bathtub, sink and 
   toilet that magically flow with the red stuff), lots of magic rituals 
   that include human sacrifices, battling magicians and burning 
   incense; and tons of cheap optical effects and in-camera tricks. 
   Other craziness also on view includes badly translated (and 
   hilarious) hard-coded English subtitles (&quot;Brother, why do you 
   say that, we're friend?&quot;); some graphic Vietnam War stock 
   footage; and lots of&nbsp; &quot;What the fuck?!?&quot; moments, such 
   as when Sau Au Yeung takes a supernaturally-assisted wheelchair ride 
   down a road and passes his son (who is driving the opposite way), 
   who, rather that trying to catch-up with his father, stops the car, 
   picks-up his father's hat off the side of the road and tosses it into 
   the car! Say what you want about these Hong Kong horror films; they 
   may make very little sense (especially to our Western sensibilities), 
   but they are entertaining as hell. <B>BLOODY SORCERY</B> (also known 
   as <B><A HREF="blood_sorcery_1986c.htm">BLOOD SORCERY</A></B> and <B>THE

   together. He shows up at a church service in the nude. He is put into 
   a mental institution but is soon released because he is not 
   considered a threat to society. Harry's brother, Ben (Navarre Perry), 
   sets him up with a new apartment in a deserted hotel and soon strange 
   things, both real and imagined, begin to happen. Harry spots three 
   thugs destroying an adjacent apartment and has them arrested, the 
   thugs vowing revenge. Harry has a teddy bear that he imagines can 
   talk. Before long, Harry's mind is playing so many tricks on him (his 
   bedsheet turns into a snake; the deserted hotel suddenly has a 
   bellhop and suicidal occupants) that no one believes him when the 
   three thugs come back to get even. He manages to get away but is 
   blamed for the damages. The FBI shows up at his door and accuse him 
   of firing a rifle out his window at a passing plane. They find no 
   rifle, only a broomstick. When the three thugs return again, Harry 
   pulls a revolver from inside his teddy and plays an impromtu game of 
   Russian roulette, scaring the shit (literally!) out of the hoodlums 
   and then lets them go free. Harry has just made three new friends who 
   are later instrumental in helping him obtain a machine gun. Harry 
   falls in love with his psychiatrist (Pamela Baker), but she just 
   wants to help him, trying to convince Harry to voluntarily commit 
   himself. He refuses. Harry's wife (Teresa Mae Allen), whom he has 
   seperated from, stops by to make his life hell. Many more things 
   happen (some so surreal you'll have to watch it twice) to Harry until 
   his mind completely snaps, causing him to grab the machine gun and 
   slaughter dozens of patrons at a nearby diner. This is Bloody 
   Wednesday. This is pretty strong material as an indictment against 
   the mental health industry and outdated laws. Harry is an outcast in 
   the outside world and since he hadn't committed any serious crimes 
   until the finale, he couldn't be committed without his consent. 
   Raymond Elmendorf is spellbinding as Harry, as we view his slow 
   mental deteriorization resulting in the bloody and shocking final act 
   of a confused man. This is not kid's stuff. Writer and producer

   (1973). This film picks up directly where the first one ended: after 
   showing a quick succession of re-edited scenes from the first film, 
   Manda (Rosemarie Gil), the snake-haired woman, falls off a cliff 
   after torch-carrying villagers burn down he<A HREF="bruka_queen_of_evil_1973c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bruka queen of evil poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="221" HEIGHT="320" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>r
    home (actually, she fell off the cliff while doing battle with the 
   film's hero, but let's not split hairs). Manda wakes up in a cave 
   occupied by her grandmother, Bruka (Played by Etang Ditched, who, in 
   the English subtitles, is referred to as &quot;Carol Pak&quot;. The 
   name &quot;Bruka&quot; is not mentioned once.), who has the head (and 
   big fright hair) of an old woman and the body of a giant snake (a 
   real sight to behold as she slithers around the cave with her dwarf 
   assistants in tow!). Grandma gives Manda a black stone and tells her 
   that when she puts it in her mouth, her snake hair will disappear and 
   she will look normal and when she takes it out of her mouth the 
   snakes will once again appear (Why would anyone create such a stone? 
   The mind boggles!). Manda puts the stone in her mouth and, sure 
   enough, her serpent-filled head turns into a beautiful black mane of 
   hair. She is so grateful that she hugs her grandmother's huge snake 
   body. Manda looks upon this new development as a way to get revenge 
   on those who killed her parents (you really should watch <B>DEVIL WOMAN</B>,
    or at least read my <A HREF="fantasy.htm#DevilWoman1973">review</A>, 
   before viewing this film to truly understand Manda's motivations) and 
   Grandma gives her an army of dwarves, snakes, rock creatures, walking 
   trees (!) and other strange monsters to protect her as she goes on 
   her killing spree. At first Manda is just happy to appear in public 
   without a scarf on her head (she prances around the forest is 
   slow-motion, twirling around while her hair dances in the wind), but 
   soon she starts getting even with the villagers. One unlucky gent 
   (Filipino regular Charlie Davao) is bitten in the face and 
   constricted to death by a horde of snakes. A horny young man with a 
   guitar puts the moves on Manda, but she removes the black stone from 
   her mouth and the young man is bitten to death by her head-full of 
   snakes. Meanwhile, a gang of ruffians charge into a restaurant and 
   beat-up the waiters (&quot;Bring us wine!&quot;) and put their hands 
   all over the female staff (at one point, the bald-headed leader of 
   the gang makes the obviously gay manager kiss one of the girls, but 
   gets a surprise when the manager plants a wet one on the top of his 
   bald head!), which visibly upsets bouncer Hon Ping (Alex Lung), who 
   ends up taking-on the gang single-handedly and beating them all to a 
   pulp with his kung-fu expertise (and he gets fired from his job by 
   the restaurant's owner because his fighting has chased away all the 
   customers!). Upset that he has lost his job, because he has a young 
   sister and sickly mother depending on him (When he gives his sister 
   two dollars, she looks at her ill mother and says, &quot;I'll cook 
   for you tomorrow!&quot; Why not cook for her today?), Hon Ping 
   accepts a job from sleazy, cigar-chomping rich man Mr. Tong (after 
   beating all of Mr. Tong's thugs in a long martial arts fight), who 
   offers him fifty thousand dollars to rescue is daughter Louisa 
   (Sandra de Veyra), who has disappeared in the forest on her way to 
   her aunt's house (all the other men who were sent to find her were 
   killed by a &quot;ghost&quot; in the forest). Manda continues her 
   killing spree, picking up a guy at a disco (when she leaves the 
   disco, one guy's plate of noodles turns into snakes and everyone 
   leaves the place screaming, &quot;Snakes...let's run away!&quot;) and 
   killing him with the old black stone trick. When it is revealed that 
   Manda kidnapped Louisa so she could be sacrificed in a full moon 
   ceremony by Bruka (turns out Louisa is a virgin), it is up to Hon 
   Ping to use his kung-fu skills (and a newly acquired weapon that must 
   be seen to be believed) to battle Manda and Bruka's seemingly 
   never-ending supernatural assault. Like the later Bruce Lee film <B><A HREF="game_of_death_1979.htm">GAME

   a succession of more deadly opponents (including a boar-man who can 
   punch so hard, he can leave holes in trees!) until he finally 
   faces-off with Manda and Bruka and rescues Louisa and a group of 
   female virgins.&nbsp; This crazy mix of martial arts (with plenty of

   Villar (who both co-directed the first film) and produced by Jimmy L.

   Po), is full of &quot;What The Fuck?!?&quot; moments, including Hon 
   Ping helping a monk (played by Filipino staple Ramon D'Salva) and his 
   hunchbacked apprentice (this guy's hunch is huge!) bury the 
   population of an entire village killed by snake bites (the monk and 
   the hunchback are soon murdered by Manda and three dwarves); Hon Ping 
   fighting an army of little people, tossing them into the air like rag 
   dolls; Hon Ping's battle with the rock creatures (Hon Ping winces 
   every time he hits or kicks them until he gets the smart idea of 
   hitting them with boulders!); the sacrifice of a topless female 
   virgin during a full moon ceremony, where the poor girl is crushed to 
   death by the rock creatures' repeated blows and is then devoured by 
   Bruka's minions until only her bloody breasts are left (!); and so 
   much more (including a mysterious hermit in the forest who gives Hon 
   Ping the tools to defeat the evil, but not before making Hon Ping 
   suffer a couple of days before doing so). If you are lucky enough to 
   score a copy (a special &quot;Thank You&quot; to <A HREF="http://www.bamboogodsandbionicboys.blogspot.com">Andrew

   damned good, except for some damage at reel changes), but it did play 
   in U.S. theaters during the mid-70's to the early-80's (Those prints

   changed their minds) who comes alive when he and Davis must come up

   deaths to be natural, but Elvis (who has some sort of psychic 
   connection to the mummy) and Kennedy (who Elvis saves before his soul 
   could be sucked out of his ass) know different. Filled with good 
   humor and actual pathos, <B><A HREF="bubba_ho_tep2.htm">BUBBA HO-TEP</A></B> 
   should be congratulated on making a horror film with actual soul (no

   giving it away here) and could have actually happened. The only 
   drawback to this film is that there is no actual Elvis songs on the 
   soundtrack as either it was too expensive or his estate refused to 
   license them to the production. But just sit back and enjoy Campbell 
   and Davis' performances. I doubt you see anything like this again and 
   it wouldn't be a Coscarelli film without some flying lethal object:

   reason why this film is special to me.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    It doesn't take long for the zombies to attack. As the zombies chase 
   Janet and Mark through the estate's grounds (Janet: &quot;What is 
   it?&quot; Mark: &quot;Whatever it is, it's not human. It's a walking 
   corpse!&quot; How could it be not human and be a corpse? Don't think

   on a bear trap (!), while necking couple James (Simone Mattioli; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#OtherHell">THE
    OTHER HELL</A></B> - 1980) and Leslie (Antonella Antinori) come 
   running to her and Mark's rescue, caving-in the skulls of two zombies 
   by bashing their heads with rocks. George is the first to die, as 
   zombies tear him apart and eat his innards, while Evelyn and Michael 
   escape. Pretty soon, all the survivors are trapped in the house, 
   while dozens of zombies chop away at the front door with axes (these 
   are not your normal, mindless zombies).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    &quot;They can only be killed if we blow their heads off!&quot; says 
   James, as he uses the zombies for target practice, blowing their 
   heads off with a shotgun while standing on a second floor terrace. A 
   short time later he runs out of shotgun shells, so everyone will have 
   to find another way to kill them (Earlier in the film, Evelyn and 
   Michael set two zombies on fire, but it would be stupid to do the 
   same thing inside the house). Leslie is the next to die when a zombie 
   pulls her through a broken window, the broken glass cutting her face 
   into bloody pieces (The zombie that kills her suddenly drops dead! 
   But why? Like I said earlier, don't ask too many questions!). Leslie 
   becomes a zombie and puts the bite on Michael (who just put the 
   sexual moves on Mom, in the film's most hilarious/unsettling moment). 
   Evelyn discovers Leslie chewing on Michael's torn-off arm and she 
   bashes Leslie's head in on the side of a bath tub. This won't be the 
   last time that Evelyn has to deal with Michael, though. The zombies 
   break through the front door and invade the house, so Mark and James 
   pick up two swords and make mincemeat out of several zombie heads 
   with well-placed blows. Professor Ayres (Remember him?) is now a 
   zombie and kills butler Nicholas (Claudio Zucchet; <B><A HREF="yeti_1977.htm">YETI:

   as they thought. James sees a group of robed monks in the monastery's 
   chapel, only these monks are now zombies who make James their latest 
   meal. The trio escape from the monastery and end up in some model 
   builder's workshop. They are greeted by a zombie on the second floor, 
   while the rest of the zombies try to get in through the front 
   door.&nbsp; Mark hits the zombie with a hefty piece of wood (but 
   keeps missing its head!) and eventually throws it over the stone 
   railing. Michael shows up as a zombie missing an arm and exposes 
   Evelyn's right breast (A delirious Evelyn says, &quot;Yes, just like 
   when you were a baby!&quot;) and, in a scene that will not likely be 
   forgotten, Michael bites off her nipple! The film concludes with all 
   the zombies invading the workshop, as a zombified James grabs Mark's 
   arm and puts it in the path of a spinning blade of a table saw and 
   the zombies surround Janet. The film ends on this note, as an end 
   scrawl proclaims: <B>&quot;The Earth shall tremble....graves shall 
   open....they shall come among the living as messengers of death and 
   there shall be the night of terror....&quot; -</B><A HREF="burial_ground_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/burial ground 1980 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="130" HEIGHT="231" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A><B>

    Like I said in the beginning of this review, this film is 
   entertaining for all the wrong reasons. The person who dubbed 
   Michael's voice is hilarious to the extreme and the dialogue that 
   comes out of his and everyone else's mouths are risible, such as when 
   Michael says, &quot;Mother, this cloth smells of death!&quot; (How in 
   the hell would a child know what death smells like?). Speaking of 
   Michael, actor Peter Bark (real name; Pietro Barzocchini) became a 
   minor celebrity thanks to this film, appearing at horror conventions 
   worldwide (an extra on this Blu-Ray is of an interview with Bark at 
   such a convention in 2013). The fact is that Bark is more 
   frightening-looking than any zombie in this film (he looks like a 
   miniature Dario Argento!) and his incestuous relationship with his 
   mother brings on more horror than director Andrea Bianchi (the 
   amazingly entertaining crime thriller <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CryOfAProstitute">CRY
    OF A PROSTITUTE</A></B> - 1974; the giallo <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#StripNudeKiller">STRIP
    NUDE FOR YOUR KILLER</A></B> - 1975) wanted to convey, but since 
   most of it is due to the atrocious dubbing, we can't blame him. The 
   zombies are appropriately creepy (lots of maggots and worms), but 
   static (very seldom do we see their mouths move). This film, also 
   known as <B><A HREF="burial_ground_1981.htm">BURIAL GROUND: THE 
   NIGHTS OF TERROR</A></B>, was lensed at an historic Italian landmark 
   known as Villa Parisi (another extra on the Blu-Ray is a tour through 
   the location as it stands today). The location shoot is very 
   atmospheric, making it a character unto itself. The script, by Piero 
   Regnoli (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#City Walking Dead">CITY OF THE 
   WALKING DEAD</A></B> - 1980), is full of zombie cliches (no matter 
   how fast our survivors are, the slow, shuffling zombies always manage 
   to catch up with them) and, if you think too hard about this film, 
   you will realize that it is a rather boring affair. Just keep your 
   brain in check and you will probably have a good time with it.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    BUTCHERS</A><A NAME="Butchers2014"></A> (2014) -</B> This 
   unusually-plotted film begins with the opening credits playing over a 
   series of photos of notorious U.S. serial killers. We are then 
   flashed-back to the past, where we see a wife hiding from her abusive 
   husband Luther (Brian Oerly), who has just snapped the neck of a 
   neighbor who tried to intervene. She has an Order of Protection 
   against him (like a piece of paper ever stopped a violent person) and 
   Luther is drunk, to boot. Their young son Simon (Pappy Faulkner) is 
   watching it all unfold, when Luther finds his wife, punches her in 
   the face and keeps wailing on her. She starts laughing when she sees 
   her neighbor lying dead in the back yard (&quot;Something funny, 
   cunt?&quot;) and Luther's bloodied wife tells him he will never see 
   Simon again because &quot;They're coming for you!&quot; Luther says, 
   &quot;These pigs. They ain't ever going to get me! You ain't ever 
   going to see him again either!&quot; He lifts his wife by her hair, 
   throws her on a chair and slits her throat woth a strait-razor, all 
   in front of Simon. Young Simon beats his father to death with a golf 
   club (I believe it's a nine iron). Twenty years pass and we see 
   returning war veteran Simon (Damien Puckler) riding a bus with his 
   best friend Brian (Cameron Bowen) and a whole bunch of <A HREF="butchers_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/butchers 2014 poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>different
    people, along with a creepy bus driver (Dave Beacham) who adjusts 
   his mirror so he can get a good look at the two ditzy females sitting 
   in the front row, Nicole (Ire Wardlaw) and Candi (Charito Mertz). The 
   two girls give the bus driver their first names (&quot;Mmmmm. I like 
   candy!&quot;), but he refuses to tell him his real name, saying that 
   it is &quot;Elmer J. Fudd&quot;. A religious couple, Bill (Braxton 
   Davis) and Daisy (Millie Sanders) ask punker Ren (Jeremy Thorsen) to 
   put out his cigarette, but it takes Simon getting out of his seat and 
   a stern warning from the bus driver to get him to put it out. Ren's 
   punker girlfriend, Star (Tonya Kay), is passed out on the back seat 
   of the bus.&nbsp; We then move away from the bus as we see a black 
   man (with a foreign accent) named JB (Semi Anthony) pull into what 
   looks like a ghost town, when &quot;The Collector&quot; says &quot;You
    are late!&quot; The Collector has created a town attraction called 
   &quot;DEATH FACTORY: SERIAL KILLER MUSEUM&quot; where every building 
   in the ghost town is full of actual memorabilia of the U.S.'s six 
   worst serial killers (The film is known as <B><A HREF="death_factory_2014.htm">DEATH
    FACTORY</A></B> in other countries). The Collector has also created 
   a brochure on Photoshop (!) where there is an empty space that says 
   &quot;Unknown Killer&quot;. JB tells The Collector that he wants to 
   buy the entire town (he gives JB a tour and he seems especially 
   interested in the Ed Gein house), since everything in the town is 
   original and took The Collector years to collect. The Collector is 
   only looking for investors and turns JD's offer down. JB 
   counter-offers by plunging a knife into The Collector's heart, 
   killing him. JB begins drawing pentagrams on every house's floor and 
   in the middle he puts a vial of the actual serial killers' blood. JB 
   then performs a ritual using The Book Of The Dead to raise Albert 
   Fish (Rick Williams), John Wayne Gacy (Hawks Walk), Jeffrey Dahmer 
   (Marion Kopf), The black-hooded Zodiac Killer (John C. Epperson), Ed 
   Gein (Gary Kasper; also the Stunt Coordinator) and Jack The Ripper 
   (Mary LeGault; yes it will be explained) all back to life in this 
   special little town. Of course, the bus overheats, and all of the 
   passengers walk to the ghost town while the bus driver waits for 
   help, unaware that JB has some very bloody surprises waiting for 
   them. This is the way it works: If you kill a serial killer, you 
   absorb their power, so JB hopes to become that &quot;Unknown 
   Killer&quot; in the brochure and become the greatest serial killer in 
   U.S. history. Unfortunately, he has some unexpected competition in 
   Simon, who learned how to kill efficiently in the military. But Simon 
   doesn't want to become a serial killer, so which ever killer's powers 
   he absorbs, he will use them for good. The bus' other passengers, 
   which include Jen (Christy Keller; who Brian is crushing on) and her 
   jock boyfriend Kip (Jacob Hobbs), who ignores Jen and is more 
   interesting in working out, and old black lady Auntie May (Mara 
   Hall), get creeped out by the town and decide to walk back to the 
   bus, only to discover it is gone (Can you say 
   &quot;set-up&quot;?).They have no choice but to stay at the ghost 
   town for the night and wait until morning before they set out on 
   foot. Ren and Star break up from the group for a little hanky-panky, 
   where Ren finds The Book Of The Dead and reads a passage and suddenly 
   the whole town shakes. Looks like Ren has started things off a little 
   too early for JB's liking, as the entire town shakes like there is an 
   earthquake. All of the serial killers appear in their pentagrams, but 
   according to JB, they have come back as different people; meaner and 
   more murderous. JB beats the hell out of Albert Fish, Ed Gein kills 
   Star and the Zodiac Killer starts to drag Ren away carrying a sickle, 
   but Gein doesn't care about anyone &quot;crashing my party&quot; and 
   pulls out a chainsaw, but it is just a tease to the audience, as The 
   Zodiac just walks away dragging Ren. Fish gets into a fight with 
   Simon, who easily kills Fish and we see him &quot;absorb&quot; his 
   power&quot;. Bill walks into John Wayne Gacy's house, where he is 
   stabbed over and over. Kip, Candi and Nicole have a three-way in one 
   of the houses, which just happens to be the abode of Jeffrey Dahmer. 
   He takes a bite out of Kips arm, but Kip knocks him out, only to be 
   chased by Jack The Ripper and finally into The Zodiac, who is holding 
   Ren's decapitated head (Can't Kip catch a break?). Suddenly, there's 
   a bolt of lightning (huh?) and Jack the Ripper chases the twi sexpots 
   and they decide to hide until morning. The Zodiac tries to kill Daisy 
   (who doesn't know her husband is dead), but the fiesty Aunty May 
   punches him in his face (That's what he gets for wearing a hood in 
   front of a black woman!). As they say, never trust your best friends, 
   as Nicole pushes Candi out into the open in Jack the Ripper's 
   direction and he carries her away. Simon and Daisy find the dead body 
   of The Collector (along with his Photoshopped brochure in his shirt 
   pocket), but Daisy refuses to leave until she finds her husband. 
   Daisy also happens to be an expert on Satanic cults, thanks to her 
   years spent at seminary school, so what she knows is important to 
   whomever is still alive. They go looking for Bill and find a 
   pentagram with a broken vial of Jeffrey Dahmer's blood. JB has<A HREF="death_factory_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/death factory aka the butchers 2014 advance poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Nicole tied-up in a barn and stabs her in the stomach, twisting the 
   blade until all her innards fall on the floor. Jack the Ripper 
   actually turns out to be a woman (she wore a rubber mask to disguise 
   herself as a man, even though rubber wasn't used in the 1880's to 
   make masks) dressed in S&amp;M clothing, who has a totally naked 
   Candi tied to a barber chair (pretty ingenius if you ask me). She 
   kisses Candi all over her naked body and then graphically cuts off 
   one of Candi's nipples with a strait-razor. Simon &amp; Daisy go to 
   Gacy's house, where they see Bill's dead body. Auntie May, Brian and 
   Jen are being attacked by The Zodiac, but Brian ends up being caught 
   by Dahmer. The dead Bill (who is now dressed like a clown) is being 
   eulogised by Daisy, but&nbsp; Gacy attacks Simon ands knocks him out 
   with an axe handle. Auntie May and Jen go looking for Brian, who is 
   being nibbled on by Gacy while tied to a table. Gein appears and the 
   two serial killers get into a fight and Dahmer ends up dead (We see 
   Gein absorb Dahmer's powers). Gacy has Daisy and Simon tied to chairs 
   and Gacy&nbsp; plants a knife into Simon's shoulder for calling him a 
   &quot;Freak&quot;.&nbsp; Simon has had enough, head-butts Gacy, 
   breaks the chair he is tied to into a million pieces, pulls the knife 
   out of his shoulder and stabs Gacy in the eye (Simon absorbs Gacy's 
   powers). Simon then kills Jill The Ripper (a knife up her chin). JB 
   kidnaps Auntie May, so he and Simon get into a fight (it is very well 
   choreographed) and JB runs away. JB then kills Gein, with a 
   cinderblock, so he inherits both Gein and Dahmer's powers. The score 
   is now 3 serial killers dead at Simon's hands and two serial killers 
   dead at JB hands. The Zodiac is the last serial killer left alive, so 
   who will win the fight to kill him? It's one hell of a fight, I'll 
   give them that, even if there was an unnecessary death just before 
   the fight. The Zodiac Killer is set on fire and Auntie May runs him 
   over with a car (Wait a minute. A car? Where the hell did that come 
   from? Wouldn't the group have discovered it, especially since it is 
   at the town's garage?). Looks like JB will be sitting beside the 
   Devil, just not in the way he imagined, since Simon has killed him. 
   But wait a minute: The bus driver just happens to be Satan himself 
   and revives JB back to life, saying they still have work to do, as 
   the rest of the group leave town in the car. The film ends on an 
   omonous note, just like most DTV films, setting the film up for a 
   possible sequel. There are a lot more serial killers out there to 
   exploit.&nbsp; This is a great idea for a film, but most of the 
   characters are cliched and there could have been many more fights 
   between the serial killers than just the all-to-short one between 
   Gein and Dahmer. The fights that there are are very well done and 
   director Steven Paul Judd (<B><A HREF="headgame_2015.htm">HEADGAME</A></B> 
   - 2015) should be proud of them and co-screenwriters Stephen Durham 
   (the director and screenwriter of <B><A HREF="bloodlines_2007.htm">BLOODLINES</A></B> 
   - 2007) and David McClellan (a jack-of-all-trades on this film) 
   thankfully fill the film with plenty of nudity, good fights and and 
   lots of bloody gore to keep your mind off the film's gaping plot 
   holes. Still, it's unusual enough to watch and if a sequel were to be 
   made, I would definitely view it. Nothing groundbreaking, but worth a 
   look. An <A HREF="http://www.uncorkedentertainment.com">Uncork'd Entertainment</A>

   usually had someone of the cloth as an evil person or even the

    a seldom seen supernatural movie about incest.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The film opens with a naked man and woman in bed, discussing how the 
   man's wife will never know the pleasure of adultery (&quot;She has no 
   opinion. She just knows abstinence.&quot; says the man in horribly 
   translated English subtitles). The woman says this about his wife: 
   &quot;Didn't she never experience the amusement of immortality?&quot; 
   (Now the subtitler is using a double negative in a sentence. For 
   shame!), as she reaches for the man's penis. &quot;Damn. We are so 
   pitiful.&quot; he replies, as they get down and dirty (Not only is 
   their conversation nonsensical, I doubt even Sigmund Freud could 
   decipher it!). The woman stops before the man is finished, telling 
   him his time is up and he must leave, where we discover she is a 
   prostitute named Dolores (Karin Lorson) and the man is her john. When 
   he leaves, someone wearing black boots, a cape and black gloves 
   enters her room and kills her with a strange three-bladed weapon. We 
   then cut to the following morning, where Duke Lionello Shandwell 
   (Mark Damon; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#NakedYouDie">NAKED YOU DIE</A></B> 
   - 1968) enters the village on horseback and watches as the police 
   take the dead prostitute's body away. The village Judge (Franco 
   Jamonte; <B><A HREF="sword_of_the_conqueror_1961.htm">SWORD OF THE CONQUEROR</A></B> 
   - 1961) tells one of his men to get a list of all the prostitute's 
   clients. The Judge gives the Duke a nod and Lionello goes home, where 
   maid Gisella (Marzia Damon, as &quot;Caterina Chiani&quot;; <B><A HREF="hand_that_feeds_the_dead_1974.htm">THE
    HAND THAT FEEDS THE DEAD</A></B> - 1974) tells him that 
   &quot;she&quot; has arrived. The Duke is happy beyond words, as we 
   discover &quot;she&quot; is the Duke's sister, Barbara (Claudia 
   Gravy; <B><A HREF="kilma_queen_of_the_amazons_1975.htm">KILMA, QUEEN 
   OF THE AMAZONS</A></B> - 1975). Right from the start, we can see that 
   this is more than a brother/sister relationship, as they call each 
   other &quot;sweetheart&quot; and &quot;darling&quot;. Barbara has 
   been away in Rome for over a year, telling her brother that they will 
   never be separated again (Which brings up the questions: Why was she 
   away for over a year? Did Lionello screw his sister?).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    They dote on each other like lovers, that is until Barbara tells her 
   brother that she has gotten married. Lionello yells at her, saying 
   that they made a promise to each other to be together forever, but 
   Barbara says, &quot;We are not children anymore. Brothers and sisters 
   can't get married!&quot; (I guess they have never been in the Deep 
   South!). Barbara introduces her brother to her new husband, Giordano 
   (Aldo Bufi Landi; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#FourFliesVelvet1971">FOUR 
   FLIES ON GREY VELVET</A></B> - 1971), an older gentleman who shakes 
   Lionello's hand, saying, &quot;You don't look like brother and 
   sister&quot; and invites him to come and visit them at their house in 
   Rome. Lionello is civil to Giordano, but you can see in his eyes that 
   he wants to strangle him for putting his hands on his sister. 
   Giordano notices it, too, telling Barbara that he didn't make a good 
   first impression with her brother and that Lionello is not happy that 
   he is going to be separated from her again. That is putting it mildly.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Lionello spies on his sister kissing Giordano and has memories of 
   him and Barbara having hot, passionate naked sex, but is it all in 
   his mind? Giordano tries to make friends with Lionello, but he turns 
   down Giordano's offers to go horseback riding and hunting with him. 
   He does, however, agree to be taught the art of fencing, Giordano not 
   knowing that Lionello is an expert at fencing. He finds out rather 
   quickly how good Lionello really is, but Giordano is better and it 
   soon becomes a life and death fight. Barbara sees what is going on 
   and tries to break it up, but Lionello accidentally cuts her arm with 
   his rapier and runs to the barn, embarrassed and emotionally hurt. In 
   the barn, Lionello spies on Gisella having sex with one of the grooms 
   and she notices him looking at her and smiles, only in his eyes 
   Gisella is actually Barbara. As a matter of fact, every woman he sees 
   from this moment on has the face of his sister, so much so, that he 
   can no longer separate fantasy from reality. Lionello is so obsessed 
   with his sister that he pulls out an ancient book of magic out of a 
   locked case he keeps in his attic, recites a passage and is possessed 
   by Byleth, the demon of incest (or is he?). Someone then kills 
   Gisella with the three-bladed weapon, the same weapon used on the 
   dead prostitute days before. The Judge is stumped, as he has never 
   seen anything like this before. He asks the village Doctor (Fernando 
   Cerulli; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DeathSmilesMurder73">DEATH 
   SMILES ON A MURDERER</A></B> - 1973) how Lionello is doing and he 
   tells the Judge he is doing better, but he is &quot;very 
   sensitive&quot; because &quot;we can't control his nerves all the 
   time.&quot; Apparently, this is not the first time the Doctor has 
   treated Lionello for his sensitivity. Is Byleth possessing Lionello 
   or is it merely an excuse to absolve him of murder in his twisted mind?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Judge asks Barbara if her brother had fits like this before and 
   she says yes, when he was 10 years old. &quot;One day we played in 
   the garden and he suddenly ran away. Our father had died a short time 
   before. I found Lionello foaming at the mouth, lying on the ground 
   under some brush. He talked...I don't really remember...a strange 
   word.&quot; Giordano asks Barbara if she remembers the word, but she 
   says she doesn't, telling him &quot;Like a...Like a name of a 
   stranger.&quot; (I think what she really said was &quot;A strange 
   name&quot;, as the subtitlers don't quite have a grasp of the English 
   language). Barbara tells the Judge to be careful, because her brother 
   had many fits in his life and he seems to be getting worse. The 
   Doctor then interjects, telling Barbara that Lionello is getting 
   better, but is he?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Judge has received the list of names of the dead prostitute's 
   clients and Lionello's name is on that list. When the Judge questions 
   Lionello, asking him where he was when the prostitute was killed, he 
   tells him he was sleeping in the park, but it is obvious to the Judge 
   that he is lying, but since he is a Duke, he has to have more than 
   suspicions. He needs proof. Lionello tells the Judge that he knew 
   Gisella was stumping the groom, Dario (Tony Denton), to throw 
   suspicion off himself, but the Judge can see through his deception. 
   The police search Dario's home and find a bloody shirt that Lionello 
   planted there. Since this was over a hundred years before there was 
   such a thing as a <B><A HREF="csi_tv.htm">CSI</A></B>, the police 
   arrest Dario. Lionello, thinking the heat is off of him, has a 
   playful roll on the ground with his sister, when it suddenly turns 
   serious, Lionello telling her he has a secret. Barbara asks what it 
   is and he says his lips are sealed. She asks how she can open his 
   lips (She's just asking for it, don't you think?) and he replies, 
   &quot;With our magic ritual. Eye on eye. Nose on nose. Lips on 
   lips.&quot; which Barbara does, but the lips part is just a peck, 
   which disappoints Lionello. &quot;Tell me your secret&quot; says 
   Barbara and Lionello replies, &quot;Sometimes strange things happen 
   to me. In these moments I am no longer in control of my mind. You 
   must help me.&quot; Barbara agrees, but before she can do anything, 
   Giordano calls out her name and she goes running to him, further 
   messing with Lionello's fragile psyche.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There will be a few more deaths before anything is resolved, as 
   Lionello sees his sister making hot, passionate, naked love to 
   Giordano, sending him on a spiral of violence. We must figure out if 
   Lionello is actually possessed or if he's just mentally unstable. 
   Things come to a boil when Giordano sets Lionello up with his 
   beautiful cousin Floriana (Silvana Pompili). The local priest 
   (Antonio Anelli; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WhatDoneSolange1972">WHAT 
   HAVE YOU DONE TO SOLANGE?</A></B> - 1972) tells the Judge, doctor and 
   Giordano that the murders are being committed by Byleth, a demon with 
   the face of an angel. This demon kills his victims with a weapon with 
   three blades, the three blades being &quot;a bloody symbol of the 
   Holy Trinity.&quot; When Barbara hears the name, she becomes a 
   different person, making us believe that Lionello is not possessed at 
   all. According to the priest's description, Byleth could actually be...Barbara!</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Norbert Blake (his only film credit; which makes me believe it is a 
   pseudonym for Savona), is a seldom-seen film that deals with a very 
   touchy subject, but like I said in the beginning of this review, no 
   subject is taboo to Italian filmmakers. Good thing, too, because this 
   flick is must viewing for genre film lovers. There is plenty of 
   full-frontal nudity, bloody violence and a decent mystery to go along 
   with the subject matter. The normally stiff Mark Damon (who put 
   acting on the back burner to become a producer of some A-and-B-List 
   films, including <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Arena1973">THE ARENA</A></B>

   and my favorite, <B><A HREF="universal_soldier_day_of_reckoning_2012.htm">UNIVERSAL
    SOLDIER: DAY OF RECKONING</A></B> - 2012, something he is still 
   doing right up to this day) really shines here as a man with no moral 
   compass, his actions are based on what he is feeling at the moment. 
   If he were alive now, he would probably be diagnosed as suffering 
   from epilepsy, but back in the mid-1800s, it takes on a more 
   supernatural sheen. That is to say it wouldn't be considered a 
   medical problem but, rather, an emotional problem (On more than one 
   occasion, people say that Lionello is suffering from 
   &quot;delirium&quot;). This film is not as exploitative as it could 
   have been and that's a good thing, because the subject matter is 
   dealt with seriously, like an episode of <B><A HREF="law_and_order_special_victims_unit_tv_series.htm">LAW
    &amp; ORDER: SVU</A></B> and less like some cheap exploitation 
   flick. That's not to say that there aren't some cheap thrills to be 
   had here, because there are, but the story always comes back to 
   earth, rather than becoming a standard gore-a-thon. Director Savona 
   has a nice feel for the period and most of the actors imbue their 
   characters with a sense of normalcy, the way people would act in that 
   time frame. If you are looking for something rare and different, look 
   no further than this film.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   (a literal translation of the review title), this film never had a

   never even dubbed in English! My review is based on a DVD-R I 
   purchased from <A HREF="http://www.sinistercinema.com">Sinister Cinema</A>

   satisfactory English subtitles. Luckily, I can spreken ze Deutsch, so 
   I could understand what they were actually saying and ignore the 
   horrendously translated subtitles. Those who don't understand German

   While the party is still in full swing (we see people dancing in a 
   train to the Bunny Hop!), he brings Elena back to his place with the 
   promise to take her for some twilight horseback riding, but he rapes 
   her instead (even though she doesn't give him much of a fight). A 
   short time later, George Kassell (Jan Hendriks; <B><A HREF="college_girl_murders_1967.htm">THE

   figure out who was related and engaged to whom!!!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At this small party, the forest outside the Baron's home is 
   mentioned, where we learn that Katharina, the daughter of the Earl of 
   Saxon (Howard Vernon; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#FrenchSexMurders">THE
    FRENCH SEX MURDERS</A></B> - 1972), was found raped and murdered 
   just that morning. We know that the Baron was the guilty party, 
   simply by the way he contorts his face and eyes when Katharina's name 
   is mentioned. The Baron explains that the woods aren't safe, because 
   the Earl has released a bear (!) in the forest in hopes it will maul 
   the rapist/murderer to death. The Earl, along with his late daughter, 
   never leave the castle and don't take kindly to visitors, so none of 
   them should ever go to his castle. The party notices that Elena has 
   disappeared and learn that she has taken one of the Baron's horses 
   into the forest. The Baron, along with George and Vera, tell Roger to 
   stay behind with his fianc&eacute;e, as they hop on horses and go 
   looking for Elena and find out that the Baron's horse is in the 
   Earl's stables, where the Earl's servant, Alecos (Vladimir Medar; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#TortureChamber1967">THE
    TORTURE CHAMBER OF DR. SADISM</A></B> - 1967) tells them that he 
   found Elena passed-out and brought her into the castle, where the 
   Earl, who is a physician, is taking care of her. Alecos has no other 
   choice but to invite them in the castle (begrudgingly saying that the 
   horses need a warm stable to sleep in, but, even though he doesn't 
   want to, he is left with no other choice but to invite the trio 
   inside). Inside the castle, we see the Earl and another doctor (actor 
   unknown, but extremely familiar), performing an operation on 
   Katharina's heart (real-life open heart surgery footage), in hopes of 
   bringing her back to life, but it fails. The Earl tells the doctor 
   that they will need a living donor. Once the trio are inside the 
   castle, they must abide by the &quot;Rules of the House&quot;, where 
   they are forced to wear ancient costumes. Roger must wear the costume 
   of a King, while Vera wears one of a Queen. The Baron, on the other 
   hand, must wear the costume of Death, because, as Alecos tells him, 
   &quot;You have Death looking down on you!&quot; They then meet the 
   Earl and are soon joined by Roger and Marion, who is unconscious 
   because she fell off her horse. The Earl is shocked, because Marion 
   looks exactly like his late daughter, so he tells Alecos to put her 
   in his daughter's bedroom to recuperate, which he does. At dinner, 
   the Baron and Vera make google-eyes at each other, while the Earl 
   regales them with a true tale of his ancestors, none of them noticing 
   the extra place setting that Alecos has set on the table for the 
   Earl's dead daughter. The Earl tells them that during the 30 Year 
   War, his ancestor's daughter was raped and killed by a trio of 
   Cossacks, saying &quot;Life and death are alike, but there's also 
   love. Love has a right to kill, but he who kills for revenge will be 
   cursed!&quot; After dinner is over, Alecos shows them to their 
   bedrooms, where they will retire for the night. They all hear some 
   type of commotion going on and Alecos shows them a &quot;special&quot;
    room, where wax figures are posed in a scene showing the rape of the 
   Earl's ancestor's daughter! (Jesus, it is creepy, especially with the 
   added addition of sound effects!). The Baron tells Alecos he is not 
   staying, he's going to go back to his place, where he will get his 
   car and come back in the morning to pick everyone up (Alecos says to 
   him, &quot;I knew you would say that!&quot; and then laughs.). After 
   everyone is tucked in their bedrooms, the Earl orders Alecos to 
   retrieve Marion and bring her to the laboratory. Vera then hits on 
   Roger, telling him that she wants to make love to him, but Roger refuses.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Vera then has a dream about the ancestor's daughter's rape, where 
   the Baron, George and Roger portray the trio of Cossacks and rape the 
   daughter (portrayed by Marion), while Vera watches and masturbates! 
   The Earl's ancestor (portrayed by the Earl), then stabs Vera in the 
   heart, blaming her for his daughter's death. The ancestor's servant 
   (portrayed by Alecos) then beheads Vera with an axe. Vera wakes up 
   and screams (That was a very vivid nightmare!) and Roger comes 
   running into her bedroom. They then make love (Hey, what's good for 
   the Baron is good for Roger, too!). We then see the Earl and the 
   unnamed doctor performing surgery on Marion and Katharina as they lay 
   side-by-side (more real-life open heart surgery).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see the Baron being attacked by a man in a fake-ass looking 
   bear suit (Try not to laugh, I dare you! It is the film's 
   unintentional [?] humorous highlight). George goes looking for Marion 
   when he discovers her bed empty and gets lost in the castle's 
   catacombs, a labyrinth of tunnels that lead nowhere, where Alecos 
   taunts him verbally. The Baron then stumbles into the castle, bloody 
   and bruised, telling everyone that this entire night is nothing but a 
   &quot;bad dream&quot; (He may be right, as this film is nothing but a 
   series of weird set-pieces, none of them connected to each other, 
   just like a dream). Marion then shows up, spouting nonsense about 
   death and handing everyone a flower. The Baron says, &quot;You're not 
   Marion!&quot; and he's right, as we see George arrive in the Earl's 
   laboratory, where he finds Marion dead on the operating table, her 
   heart missing. The Earl removes &quot;Marion's&quot; wig and the 
   Baron yells out, Katharina! Katharina!&quot; Now the Earl (and 
   everyone else) knows that the Baron raped and killed the Earl's 
   daughter. The Earl tries to stab the Baron with a dagger, but 
   Katharina steps in front of him and the blade enters her heart, 
   killing her. Katharina's final words are &quot;God be with you&quot;, 
   so the Earl stabs the Baron, killing him. The Earl carries his 
   daughter's body to the castle roof, where he walks off, still holding 
   Katharina's dead body, plunging to his death. We then see the <A HREF="castle_of_the_creeping_flesh_1968.htm#Grim Reaper">Grim
    Reaper riding a horse</A> off the castle's grounds, the castle's 
   heavy iron gate closing behind him and the film ends. If you are 
   wondering what happens to George, Vera, Roger and Elena, all I can 
   tell you is this: They are inconsequential to the plot, or at least 
   to what plot there is!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Woah! This film, like I said earlier, has a dream-like quality to 
   it, but that doesn't necessarily mean that<A HREF="castle_of_the_creeping_flesh_1968.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/castle of the creeping flesh german poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="214" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   it is a good film. It is entertaining, but good? Not by a long shot. 
   The film's short running time (82 minutes) doesn't give you enough 
   time to be bored, but it does give you plenty of time to laugh, which 
   I am sure was not director/co-producer/co-screenwriter &quot;Percy G. 
   Parker's&quot; (Actually Adrian Hoven, director of <B><A HREF="long_swift_sword_of_siegfried_1971.htm">THE

    OF THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1970, as well as many other films) goal. The 
   bear attack scene got the biggest laugh from me because it comes out 
   of nowhere and once you see the bear suit, I guarantee you will be 
   laughing, too! It should also be noted that Michel Lemoine was 
   married for about a decade to Janine Reynaud after they appeared in 
   this film and may be the reason why she quit acting in the late-'70s. 
   Lemoine directed her last few films and they are hard to come by. 
   Read my review for <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#SevenWomenSatan1974">SEVEN
    WOMEN FOR SATAN</A></B> to see what he churned out. Needless to say, 
   he mugs wildly here for the camera, lusting after every woman with 
   his face and eyes, so much so he looks like a pervert. I kept asking 
   myself why he has so many friends. Can't they see what type of person 
   he is? Janine Reynaud's favorite expression in this film is to <A HREF="castle_of_the_creeping_flesh_1968.htm#JanineReynaud">put
    her hand to her cheek as if to say &quot;Oh, my!&quot;</A> A good 
   drinking game would be to take a shot every time she does it. You'll 
   be plastered in no time. As I said earlier, the screenplay (by Hoven 
   and one-timer Eric Martin Schnitzer, from a story by an uncredited 
   Jess Franco [ugh!], based on William Shakespeare's &quot;King 
   Lear&quot;) is nothing but a series of unrelated vignettes, but there 
   is plenty of female nudity (unusual for a film made in 1968) by the 
   cast, but only topless nudity. The only blood and violence we really 
   see (besides the awful bear attack) are the bloodless decapitation of 
   Vera and the real surgery footage. Go in knowing that and you should 
   have a good time with this film.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    HORROR</A><A NAME="CentipedeHorror"></A> (1987) -</B> No one ever 
   accused Hong Kong horror films of showing restraint and here's a good 
   example of restraint being thrown out the window, along with the 
   bathwater and the baby. After showing us extreme close-ups of 
   centipedes with accompanying voiceover narration giving us a short 
   history of the many-legged buggers (apparently, they have 22 sections 
   with two legs per section, which equals 44 legs; far short of 
   &quot;centipede&quot; status, but still one of the creepiest bugs on 
   the planet), we move on to the film proper, where young woman Kay is 
   begging her brother Pak (Kiu Wai Miu) to let her go on a seven day 
   vacation to Southeast Asia. He agrees to let Kay go (and not tell 
   their &quot;Mummy&quot;), but only if she'll wear this big-assed 
   medallion around her neck to ward-off evil spirits (People living in 
   Hong Kong must believe that S.E. Asia is full of dangerous 
   supernatural predators that feed on tourists). Kay reluctantly 
   agrees, puts the unwieldy medallion around her neck and the next time 
   we see her, she is jogging in S.E. Asia with a female friend. They 
   stop at a pushcart selling &quot;grass jelly&quot; and enjoy eating a 
   couple of bowls, but the guy running the pushcart notices Kay's 
   medallion and gives it an ominous look. When Kay leaves her headband 
   behind on the pushcart, the guy gives it another ominous look and you 
   just know it's going to be used in some kind of crazy Asian spell (Or 
   maybe I have watched too many Hong Kong horror flicks? Nah, it's 
   gonna be used in a spell!). Kay's girlfriend talks her into taking 
   off the medallion (&quot;It's ugly!&quot;) and she throws it into he<A HREF="centipede_horror_1987b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/centipede horror poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="319" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>r
    suitcase. Big stupid rookie mistake. Kay and her tour group go to a 
   coconut farm, where Kay drinks too much coconut milk (Is that even 
   possible?) and has to go wee-wee. She never makes it to the bathroom, 
   as she and her girlfriend are attacked by an army of centipedes and 
   they both pass out. Kay's girlfriend dies of a heart attack and Pak 
   flies to the S.E. Asia hospital where his sister is being treated, 
   only to find that Kay's entire body is covered with mysterious gaping 
   wounds (the doctor first thought it was &quot;Hiroshima radiation 
   poisoning&quot;, but quickly discards it because, hey, they're not in 
   Japan!) and she has been struck speechless. The doctor vows to find a 
   cure to this &quot;mystery disease&quot;, so Pak hooks-up with old 
   schoolmate Yeuk Chee (Margaret A. Li) and they take a night stroll 
   down the busy streets of S.E. Asia, where they meet Mr. Chan Hie, the 
   &quot;King Of The Centipedes&quot;, a man selling centipede ointment 
   to cure poisonous centipede bites. Mr. Chan visits Kay in the 
   hospital and tells Pak and Yeuk Chee that there is nothing he can do 
   for her, but they should visit his teacher, who lives very far away. 
   Before they can do that, Kay dies (with centipedes squirming out of 
   her wounds) and Pak is given her suitcase, which contains the 
   medallion. Pak is told by a fortuneteller that his generation is 
   suffering from a curse put on his grandfather and there is no way to 
   avoid his fate (The fortuneteller's advice: &quot;Do more 
   charity!&quot;). Pak keeps catching glimpses of a red figure walking 
   away from him and then flies back to Hong Kong, where Mummy (Chien 
   Szu-Ying) tells Pak that when his grandfather was young, he did a 
   &quot;shameful thing&quot; while in S.E. Asia. She is not sure 
   exactly what that shameful act was, but she knows Pak's father found 
   out just before he died. Pak, who is beginning to get bad headaches 
   and is not feeling too well, vows to discover his Grandpa's sins and 
   reverse them before it is too late. All of this happens within the 
   film's first thirty minutes and what happens during the next 63 
   minutes will have Pak questioning his sanity. It seems that fifty 
   years earlier, Pak's grandfather was responsible for burning down an 
   entire village (on the same spot where Kay was attacked by the 
   centipedes), killing everyone in the village and a vengeful wizard 
   has made it his life's work to make Pak's family suffer. How is Pak 
   going to fight this? Why, by hiring his own wizard to do battle!&nbsp;

   does, it's a non-stop sleazefest. Director Keith Li (a.k.a. &quot;Lee 
   Pak Ling&quot;; <B><A HREF="vampire_kids_1991.htm">VAMPIRE KIDS</A></B> 
   - 1991) and screenwriters Anna Chan &amp; Suet Ming have fashioned a 
   gory supernatural horror film that actually has a coherent plot for a 
   change, but that's not to say that there aren't plenty of &quot;What 
   The Fuck?!?&quot; moments, including Pak and Yeuk Chee spying on a 
   wizard performing a ritual on a totally naked woman with a gangrenous 
   stomach (it involves distilling the oil taken from the corpses of 
   children, cutting off a chicken's head, using the chicken's blood to 
   mark the woman's body with Chinese symbols and ends with her 
   puking-up a bunch of bloody scorpions!); Yeuk Chee having a spell 
   cast on her by the evil wizard, which leads to a battle between good 
   and bad wizards (the good wizard loses after putting up a valiant 
   fight); and plenty of centipede attacks (and even some centipede 
   puking). The truly demented conclusion must be seen to be believed

   all-black cast religious supernatural film that can't be considered 
   blaxploitation because of its earnestness. During a mass baptism at a 
   lake, Femi (Bill Overton) stops the baptism of girlfriend Billie 
   (Avis McCarthur) because it goes against their voodoo beliefs. Some 
   of the male parishioners of the church take offense to Femi's actions 
   and hold him underwater, drowning him. That night, the voodoo 
   community performs a ritual over Femi's body (a live chicken has it's 
   throat cut), where the voodoo priest promises that his death will not 
   go unanswered and Lord Shango, the groups highest deity, will seek 
   retribution. Billie's mother, Jenny (Marlene Clark; <B><A HREF="ganja_and_hess_1973.htm">GANJA
    &amp; HESS</A></B> - 1973; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackMamba">BLACK

   the emotional damage it has inflicted on her daughter, but Jenny's 
   fianc&eacute; Memphis (Wally Taylor), a voodoo non-believer and a 
   member of the local church, promises to get Jenny pregnan<A HREF="lord_shango_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/lord shango poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="320" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>t
    and give her a baby if it's the &quot;Lord's will&quot;, something 
   Jenny has wanted for a long time. While waitressing at the local bar, 
   Jenny talks to Jabo (Lawrence Cook), an ex-jazz drummer and voodoo 
   practitioner, who tells her that Femi's death was murder and then 
   goes on to make ominous statements that &quot;it's not over&quot;, 
   especially where Billie is concerned. He's right, of course, because 
   Billie becomes downright delirious from her grief and believes every 
   man she meets is Femi, beginning with Memphis, whom she fucks. When 
   Jenny finds out, she runs to the local church, where Memphis is 
   repenting his sins. Jenny is not so forgiving, as she slaps Memphis 
   silly and breaks off their engagement. Billie runs away from home and 
   months pass with no word from her. Then bad things begin to happen. 
   Memphis nearly cuts his arm off with a circular saw at his 
   construction job. With Jabo's encouragement, Jenny goes to the local 
   voodoo cult looking for retribution for her daughter's disappearance 
   and Femi's death and, pretty soon, members of the local church, 
   especially those involved in Femi's drowning, begin to die 
   mysteriously. Billie returns home, too, and that bump in her stomach 
   is not from overeating. Billie is pregnant with Memphis' baby, so 
   Jenny demands that Memphis marries Billie. It's also apparent that 
   Jenny will be paying a steep price for getting involved with the 
   voodoo cult. When Jenny and Jabo become lovers (he delivers a 
   devastating soliloquy about his life that will break your heart), all 
   the pieces seem to fall into place, but a final twist will test 
   everyone's faith, both voodoo practitioners and the 
   church-going.&nbsp; Not quite a horror film and not quite 
   exploitation, <B>THE COLOR OF LOVE</B> (originally released as <B><A HREF="lord_shango_1974.htm">LORD
    SHANGO</A></B>) is more of an indictment against organized religion 
   (of all types) and blindly following the rules without questioning 
   them first. Director Ray Marsh (who also gave us the PG-rated comedy <B><A HREF="last_porno_flick_1974.htm">THE
    LAST PORNO FLICK</A></B> - 1974) and screenwriter Paul Carter 
   Harrison (<B><A HREF="youngblood_1978.htm">YOUNGBLOOD</A></B> - 1978) 
   make this more of a slice-of-life drama about black life in a small 
   southern town, with supernatural overtones added for some mystery. 
   The theme to this film, &quot;The price of life is sacrifice&quot;, 
   is shown in many guises here, from Femi's drowning, the mysterious 
   deaths of the church parishioners and even Billie's pregnancy, with 
   Jabo appearing at all of them like some avenging angel as the 
   connective tissue. Not much is known about Jabo, except he's an 
   ex-musician and he drinks too much, but it's apparent that he's the 
   catalyst to everything that happens here. The question soon becomes 
   if he sits on the wings of angels or the horns of the Devil? While 
   the violence here is rather tame and very little blood is spilled on 
   screen, the story manages to hold your attention because the 
   characters are tightly drawn (Marlene Clark and Lawrence Cook are 
   excellent). These people aren't written in black and white, so it is 
   up to us to form our own opinions about them. Those going into this 
   film expecting a horror flick are going to be in for a major 
   disappointment, so keep an open mind when watching it. I'm not a 
   religious person, so let me say this: <B>THE COLOR OF LOVE</B> is a 
   film about religion that everyone can understand, from the devoutly 
   religious to the non-believer. Also known as <B><A HREF="soulmates_of_shango_1974.htm">SOULMATES

    COTTAGE</A><A NAME="Cottage2008"></A> (2008) -</B> This British 
   production is an offbeat mixture of crime and horror genres, with a 
   healthy dose of dark humor. Two bumbling crooks, brothers David (Andy 
   Serkis; <B><A HREF="inkheart_2008.htm">INKHEART</A></B> - 2008) and 
   Peter (Reece Shearsmith, who looks like a battered Kevin Spacey), 
   kidnap the buxom and foul-mouthed Tracey (Jennifer Ellison) and bring 
   her to the title abode in the middle of nowhere. It's quite obvious 
   from the start that Tracey isn't your average kidnap victim, as she 
   managed to break Peter's nose with a few well-placed head-butts, even 
   though her hands are tied behind her back and her legs bound 
   together. It turns out that Tracey is the stepdaughter of crime boss 
   Arnie and David and Peter are holding her for a 100,000-pound ransom. 
   Arnie (whose office is in the basement of a strip club) sends his son 
   Andrew (Steven O'Donnell) to deliver the ransom (not knowing that 
   Andrew is a part of the kidnapping), but Andrew is unaware that dear

   with Tracey. Andrew (who is just as bumbling as David and Peter) 
   shows up at the cottage with the satchel of ransom money, but when 
   they open it, all that is inside is wads of tissue paper (Andrew 
   incredulously says, &quot;I probably should have checked it.&quot;). 
   Things rapidly go from bad to worse when David is forced to go to 
   Plan B, but Peter blows it and manages to let Tracey get a good look 
   at all their faces. David is forced to leave the cottage and look for 
   a working phone after Peter drops their cell phone in a pond, while 
   Arnie makes his way to the cottage to join the waiting Asian hitmen. 
   David finds a phone booth and makes a new ransom demand and, after 
   being warned by the town's off-kilter elderly citizens that it is not 
   safe to be outside at night in these parts, David returns to the 
   cottage to find Peter and Tracey missing and Andrew unconscious on 
   the floor. It turns out that Tracey has now taken Peter hostage and 
   escaped into the woods, where they find a creepy farmhouse that would 
   give goose bumps to <B><A HREF="texas_chainsaw_massacre_1974.htm">THE 
   TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE</A></B>'s Sawyer clan. David and Andrew go 
   looking for them and discover Muk Li San's body tied between two 
   trees with his throat cut. It's now obvious that there is another 
   killer on the loose, as Peter and Tracey check out the farmhouse and 
   make some frightening discoveries, including a freezer full of 
   disembodied human hands and a hideous mutated monster, who stabs 
   Tracey in the stomach with a machete and chases Peter throughout the 
   house. In the finale, brothers David and Peter, both seriously 
   wounded, must defend themselves from the mutant farmer, but when 
   Peter becomes trapped in the farmhouse's basement, he will make a 
   discovery that he will not soon forget. And neither will you. Be sure 
   to stick through the end credits for a final stinger, as the until-now
    unseen Arnie arrives on the scene, only to meet the sharp end of a 
   pickaxe.&nbsp; <B><A HREF="cottage_2008b.htm">THE COTTAGE</A></B> is 
   a funny genre-bending film that has some genuine laugh-out-loud 
   moments, including Andrew's unfortunate choice of ski mask and 
   Peter's phobia of moths (one moth turns him to jelly, but when he 
   makes the unfortunate choice to enter a room in the farmhouse that is 
   full of the winged insects, hilarity ensues). Director/screenwriter 
   Paul Andrew Williams (the brilliant <B><A HREF="london_to_brighton_2006.htm">LONDON
    TO BRIGHTON</A></B> - 2006) wisely chooses to wait until the film is 
   almost two-thirds over to reveal the horror elements, as we are given 
   ample time to get to know these fucked-up characters and actually 
   care about some of them, especially Peter, who takes more damage to 
   his entire body throughout the film (including getting his right foot 
   cut in half) then what is shown in a dozen Three Stooges shorts. The 
   violence in this film is brutal (including one major character 
   getting their head cleaved in two at the jaw line with a shovel), but 
   a lot of it is played with a wicked sense of humor (poor 
   accident-prone Andrew suffers the worst of it, stepping not once, but 
   twice, on bear traps and later stepping on a rake and getting 
   clobbered on the head [like in the old cartoons of yore], only to 
   have the mutated farmer use the same rake to put a few holes in his 
   noggin before stabbing him in the balls and cutting his head off, 
   with the spinal column still attached!). I enjoyed this film 
   immensely and so should you. It's a near perfect mixture of comedy, 
   crime and atmospheric horror that's sure to please fans of black 
   comedy and, believe me, it doesn't get much blacker than this. Bloody 
   good show. Doug Bradley (<B><A HREF="hellraiser_1987.htm">HELLRAISER</A></B>

   is actually two films in one. It's partly about a possessed car that 
   runs other cars off the road (causing fiery crashes) and partly a 
   supernatural murder drama about a husband trying to knock-off his 
   wife. The wife in question is Kim Denne (Sue Lyon; <B><A HREF="end of the world.htm">END
    OF THE WORLD</A></B> - 1977), who we see walking around a flea 
   market (in the parking area of a drive-in theater). She spots a weird

    him to a wheelchair, the result of a car accident where Kim was 
   behind the wheel. After their latest fight, Kim storms out of the 
   house, attaches her newly-bought idol to her keychain and takes off 
   in her car (a Hemi Cuda convertible), only to be attacked by Marc's 
   vicious dog (who he trained just for this purpose) and getting into a 
   terrible car accident. Confined to a hospital bed and in a coma (and 
   still grasping the idol keychain in her hand), Marc must figure out a 
   way to kill Kim before she wakes up and spills the beans. He sneaks 
   into her hospital room undetected (!) and pulls out all her tubes and 
   wires, which lets a stream of her blood trickle down on the idol in 
   her hand. The idol, we will later find out, is the image of Akaza, 
   the God of Vengeance. Oh, no. Luckily, Kim's life is saved by nurse 
   Kathy (Leslie Parrish; <B><A HREF="giant_spider_invasion.htm">THE 
   GIANT SPIDER INVASION</A></B> - 1975) and Dr. Greg Martin (John 
   Ericson; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#FinalMission1984">FINAL MISSION</A></B> 
   - 1984). Kim (whose entire face is bandaged) makes a full recovery, 
   but suffers from a bad case of amnesia. While all this drama is 
   taking place, Kim's driverless car goes on a murder spree, killing 
   innocent (?) motorists and destroying dozens of police cars, the 
   possessed car always coming away without a scratch. Dr. Martin 
   borrows Kim's idol and brings it to an expert on the subject, which 
   just happens to be Marc Denne. This is not going to turn out well at 
   all, is it? Marc finally gets his hands on Kim, locks her in the 
   sauna and works out a foolproof alibi. Too bad that alibi left no 
   room for a possessed car, as it chases the wheelchair-bound Marc 
   outside and pushes him off a cliff, the car exploding on top of 
   him.&nbsp; This is a weird mixture of car chase/crash exploitation 
   (which was very popular during the 70's) and supernatural possession 
   genres (Director Elliott Silverstein would mine the same premise the 
   following year with <B><A HREF="car_1977.htm">THE CAR</A></B>). 
   There's something spooky about a driverless car speeding down the 
   highway, causing death and destruction, and director Charles Band 
   spends much of the film showing the possessed car causing accident 
   after accident, usually culminating in a car flying in slow-motion 
   through the air, crashing through objects (like signs, buildings or 
   other cars) and then exploding in a fireball. When the final edit was 
   turned in, the running time must have come up a little short, because 
   Band repeats every car crash a second time when Marc locks a 
   possessed Kim in the sauna during the film's closing minutes. The 
   film is a stunt-filled extravaganza, but there are a few creepy 
   moments, too, such as when a possessed Kim (her eyes get all big and 
   red) forces her husband's wheelchair to run over his attack dog 
   over-and-over until it is dead. Though very little blood is spilled, <B><A HREF="crash_1976b.htm">CRASH!</A></B> 
   (also known as <B>DEATH RIDE</B> and <B>AKAZA, THE GOD OF VENGEANCE</B>)
    is an entertaining quickie that should please both action and horror 
   fans. If Band spent more time making films like this and less time on 
   killer dolls and puppets, his resume wouldn't be half as bad as it 
   actually is. Also starring John Carradine (in his usual five minute 
   cameo), Jerome Guardino, Paul Dubby and cult director John Hayes (<B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#MamasDirtyGirls">MAMA'S

   eaten radioactive-poisoned plankton and have killed the yacht's 
   previous inhabitants. Now it's the kids' turn. After finding one 
   mentally-challenged professor hiding in the engine room, Mike (Clay 
   Rogers) decides to investigate what has happened and does not like 
   what he finds. The professor has turned the poisoned plankton into a

    CROSS OF SEVEN JEWELS</A><A NAME="Cross 7 Jewels"></A> (1987) -</B> 
   Try to keep up with me if you can. This film opens up with a robed 
   Gordon Mitchell presiding over a sacrificial orgy where women are 
   naked and getting whipped while other couples are just getting it on 
   (including a guy with a hairy back and a huge potbetty, bleech!). 
   Mitchell keeps asking for &quot;Aborin&quot; to appear and when it 
   does, it looks like something that would have resulted if Chewbacca 
   and a gorilla mated. The film then cuts to Marco (director Marco 
   Antonio Andolfi using the name &quot;Eddy Endolf&quot;) meeting his 
   long-lost cousin Carmela in Naples for the first time in 20 years. 
   While they are walking down the street, a man on a motor scooter 
   steals Marco's necklace, which happens to be the title creation.<A HREF="cross_of_seven_jewels_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cross of the seven jewels1.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   He acts like someone just stole his testicles and flags down two 
   police officers and they chase the man down, but he unfortunately has 
   passed the cross on to someone else. So leads us on a long journey 
   for Marco's search for his necklace as we learn bits and pieces why 
   it is so important to him. Marco soon finds out that the person he 
   thought was his cousin actually wasn't, which soon leads him down a 
   road which includes thugs, drugs, crime, the Mob and other very, very 
   bad things, all which are tied to the possession of the cross. And 
   what is Gordon Mitchell's role in all this? It's soon apparent that 
   the cross holds some mystical powers as Marco begins having 
   flashbacks, a naked wolf-man with hairy hands and an even hairier 
   face (but, strangely, hair no place else) begins killing people (they 
   melt when he touches them), and a Mafia boss snatches Marco and holds 
   him prisoner. Somehow, this all ties in to the sacrificial orgy that 
   was taking place in the beginning of the film. Good luck in piecing 
   it together. This obscure Italian hybrid, directed by one-time wonder 
   Marco Antonio Andolfi (who also supplies the cheapjack time-lapse 
   transformation effects), is one big jumbled mess but is all the more 
   watchable because of it. Mixing horror, crime, action, thriller and 
   supernatural genres, <B>CROSS</B> is a hard film to understand, even 
   if you pay 100% attention to it. The further you get into the film, 
   the weirder it gets, as you never know what direction it's heading. 
   One minute you're witnessing a man melting before your eyes, then you 
   see an acid trip-like flashback, then you are watching a Mafia drama 
   and then......Aargh! My head's spinning! There's a truth serum 
   interrogation, a stuttering mob informant, <A HREF="cross_of_seven_jewels_1987_werewolf_transformation.htm">a

   loses all his clothes when he transforms (just a tiny piece of cloth 
   hides his package) and then they magically re-appear when he changes 
   back. If you are going to watch this film, please proceed carefully 
   as a large number of you will not come out unscathed. I believe 
   that's my highest recommendation. This film would leave David Lynch 
   scratching his head. Also starring Annie Belle (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#HouseEdgePark1979">HOUSE

    Blind teenager Mark (Renato Cestie; one of the shotgun children at

   them, but Christine hears nothing, steadfastly saying, &quot;First it 
   was visions, now you're hearing non-existent noises. It sounds like a 
   guilty conscience. Why don't you get a guide dog, then you could go 
   with him instead of me having to drag you around all the time!&quot; 
   (Yes, she's a real class act). They are on their way to a funeral, as 
   we see during the opening credits<A HREF="damned_in_venice_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/damned in venice italy poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="244" HEIGHT="354" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   (music by Pino Donnaggio; <B><A HREF="dont_look_now_1973.htm">DON'T 
   LOOK NOW</A></B> - 1973; another film set in Venice), Mark and 
   Christine walking down the narrow cobblestone streets of Venice and 
   then taking a motor boat down one of the city's many canals. They 
   then meet their friend George (Fabio Gamma) and Christine wants to 
   know why he's going to the funeral, as she didn't know he knew the 
   late Mr. Garrett. &quot;Funerals always bring out the Anglo-Saxon 
   wretches that are rotting here in Venice&quot; is George's mysterious 
   reply and he tells Mark that he's not going to the funeral, he is 
   here to show a bunch of tourists around. Let's talk about Mark's 
   &quot;visions&quot;. Once at the funeral, Mark is blinded (so to 
   speak) by a flash of bright light, where he &quot;sees&quot; (after 
   hearing a human heart beating) a nattily dressed man with a mustache 
   and holding a cane kissing a pretty woman dressed in a white gown, 
   while a Doberman stands guard near them and then starts eating what 
   looks like a human appendage lying on the ground. The couple looks 
   directly at Mark and then disappear in another flash of light. Mark 
   tells Christine that he saw the man with the cane in another vision, 
   only this time he wasn't alone, he was with a woman and they were 
   kissing. Christine is obviously pissed that she has to take care of 
   her brother and constantly is putting him down, this time asking him, 
   &quot;You were frightened by two people kissing?&quot; Mark tells her 
   no, this vision was different. The dog was eating a human hand and 
   the man looked at him and raised his cane, as if he were going to hit 
   him with it. Mark points in the direction he saw the vision and 
   Christine takes him there. It turns out to be the Winters family 
   crypt, relatives of Mark and Christine. Once again, Christine puts 
   down Mark, saying, &quot;Ghosts kissing, dogs eating human hands, 
   you're crazy!&quot; On the boat ride back home, Christine sees a man 
   with a cane standing on a bridge with a Doberman sitting at his feet. 
   She then turns and looks at Mark, not telling him what she just saw.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then find out that Christine and George are engaged, but her 
   grandmother (Bettine Milne; <B><A HREF="house_of_clocks_1989.htm">HOUSE
    OF CLOCKS</A></B> - 1989), who accompanied them to the funeral, does 
   not approve. Christine asks George how he is going to support her 
   when they are married, as selling trinkets to tourists is not enough 
   money to make her happy (It seems Christine has a low opinion of all 
   men, not just her brother). Mark then tells them that he 
   &quot;felt&quot; the woman from his vision has just passed them in a 
   gondola and he begs George to go look (While Christine threatens to 
   send Mark to a school for the blind!). George looks out the window 
   and, sure enough, there is a mysterious cloaked woman in a gondola 
   who looks directly at George and smiles. George tells Mark he is 
   right and Christine says, &quot;Marvelous, now you're seeing things 
   as well. It was bad enough when only Mark was having 
   hallucinations!&quot; Why is this happening and why is Christine 
   being such a cunt?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see their grandmother talking to priest Father Christopher 
   (Jose Quaglio; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#EyeBehindTheWall">THE EYE 
   BEHIND THE WALL</A></B> - 1977), telling him that it will be over her 
   dead body if Mark and Christine (who we discover are American) will 
   go live with their Aunt Madeline and Uncle Martin, as their vacation 
   time is spent with her (Saying this about their Aunt and Uncle: 
   &quot;My hearth is their home in Venice. As long as I am living, I 
   will not allow the children anywhere near that house!&quot;). When 
   Mark and Christine arrive at the church, Granny chides them for being 
   late, Christine shooting back with, &quot;Granny, I'd like to see you 
   if you had to play guide dog every time he wants to go out for a 
   walk!&quot; (This bitch needs a good slap in the face!). Granny tells 
   them that their Aunt and Uncle want them to live in their house when 
   they are in Venice and Christine sarcastically says, &quot;Oh, how 
   nice. The Winters have suddenly remembered we are still alive. What 
   an honor!&quot; (Maybe a punch in the face would be better!). We then 
   discover that Mark and Christine's parents died in a &quot;tragic 
   accident&quot;. We also discover that they will inherit a butt load 
   of money from their parent's trust, but only when Granny dies and she 
   tells Father Christopher that will be a long time away, if she has 
   any say in the matter. I think we all know what that means, since 
   this is partially a giallo film, Granny doesn't have much time left, 
   so let the killings begin!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Father Christopher reminds them to be at the Easter Midnight Mass he 
   is performing tonight for the Anglo-Saxon community. Once they are 
   there, Mark has another vision where the man points his cane directly 
   at him. When Mark gets up to take Communion, he accidentally knocks 
   over a candle, which sets fire to Granny, killing her almost 
   immediately (As she lies burning in the aisle, no one tries to put 
   out the flames!). At Granny's funeral, no one bothers to attend, not 
   even Aunt Madeline or Uncle Martin, but Father Christopher informs 
   Mark and Christine that they must now live with them and since they 
   are under the age of consent, there is nothing they can do about it. 
   Mark goes to visit Father Christopher, telling him that his Aunt and 
   Uncle are horrible people, but the good Father tells him a secret. 
   &quot;In a storeroom in the Winters house, there's a well with magic 
   water. There was a time when people from all over the world would 
   come to the well. Cripples would just touch the water and they could 
   walk. The deaf would hear and the blind would see. The well is still 
   there, full of miracle water.&quot; Is this story a bunch of bullshit 
   to make Mark want to live at his Aunt and Uncle's house or is it true?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Mark and Christine make the trip to move into their Aunt and Uncle's 
   creepy boardinghouse. They knock on the front door and Uncle Martin 
   (Tom Felleghy; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Eyeball1975">EYEBALL</A></B> 
   - 1975) answers, but he doesn't know who they are or that they are 
   supposed to live there, but Martin lets them in when Christine 
   mentions Father Christopher's name. They then meet their Aunt 
   Madeline (Olga Karlatos; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Zombie">ZOMBIE</A></B> 
   - 1979) and even she doesn't know who they are and what they are 
   doing there, but she shows them to their rooms, an evil look on her 
   face. As the kids walk through the boardinghouse, Christine notices 
   (as do we) that all the furniture are covered in sheets and the 
   building in a bad state of disrepair, with cracked walls, peeling 
   paint and a general feeling that Martin and Madeline are purposely 
   letting it get that way. What could this possibly mean?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Madeline shows Mark and Christine to their rooms and when she opens 
   a window, she says she always gets the feeling that someone is 
   watching. She then asks them if they would like to see the rest of 
   the house. Christine flatly says no, she has seen enough, but Mark 
   asks Madeline if she could take him to the storeroom and show him the 
   well. In the storeroom, Madeline shows Mark and Christine (who has to 
   go with Mark everywhere, whether she complains or not) a stain on the 
   floor, saying legend has it that the stain will get darker when 
   something terrible is about to happen (Madeline is a very dour woman, 
   much more than Granny ever was). She shows Mark the well, telling him 
   it has only been opened twice in her lifetime and she knows there is 
   no water in it. &quot;They say so many things about it that just 
   aren't true.&quot; says Madeline, as she leads them out of the 
   storeroom without removing the cover to the well. Is Madeline telling 
   the truth?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Over lunch, Madeline makes a remark about how fruit rots so quickly 
   in this house and Christine shoots back, &quot;Well, it would help if 
   you bought a fridge, but you'll need to do more than that to make 
   this place a success.&quot; (Permission to slap the shit out of her, 
   sir?). Martin tells Madeline if Christine wants to make changes, she 
   can go right ahead and do it, but why does Madeline mention a cholera<A HREF="damned_in_venice_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/damned in venice danish vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="234" HEIGHT="355" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   outbreak when she last tried to make changes? Martin serves wine to 
   the kids during lunch (only in Italy, folks) and when Mark tapes a 
   sip, he almost spits it out, saying it tastes like blood. Martin and 
   Madeline, along with Christine, leave the table, leaving Mark on his 
   own. He hears a woman moaning, gets up and then a chandelier falls on 
   the table, right where Mark was sitting. Is this a warning or is 
   someone (or something) trying to kill him?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Mark is not familiar with the house and the bitchy Christine won't 
   even show him where the bathroom is, telling Mark to find it on his 
   own. Mark feels his way to the bathroom and when he turns on the sink 
   to wash his hands, worms come out of the faucet (which he can't see). 
   He then has another vision, where the man stabs Madeline to death 
   with his cane. He rushes to tell Christine (Why???) and, once again, 
   she belittles him with a snotty remark. He tells Martin he saw 
   Madeline killed in Room 12, but Martin tells him that they are the 
   only ones in the house, there is no one in Room 12. Christine grabs 
   Mark and shakes him, but Martin stops her and leads Mark to Room 12 
   to prove to him no one is there. Where is Madeline when all this is 
   happening? Martin says she is in her room, as she always takes a nap 
   after lunch, but Mark wants to touch her to make sure she is OK. When 
   they get to her room, Madeline looks sick, Martin telling them she 
   has a weak heart and she gets like this from time to time. Madeline 
   grabs Mark, telling him to beware of &quot;Whitsunday&quot; (the 
   seventh Sunday after Easter, celebrated as a festival in 
   commemoration of the descent of the Holy Spirit on the day of 
   Pentecost) and not to allow anyone in the house until it is over. Are 
   those the ramblings of a delirious woman or is there truth in what 
   she is saying? All of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the 
   film, but what comes next blows everything that came before it out of 
   the water.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Madeline dies and Mark then meets neighbor Vicky (Gloria Bozzola), a 
   pretty young girl who works in a gallery next door (Vicky and a nun 
   are sitting over the body of Madeline on her deathbed, which I guess 
   is an Italian tradition). They become friends and we learn that Mark 
   lost his sight when he was six years old. Vicky takes him to the well 
   and they take the cover off it, discovering that there is water in 
   it. Before Mark can touch the water, he hears Martin talking to a 
   man, who says that the children must be left alone until the baby is 
   born. As Mark and Vicky are walking upstairs, Martin's body drops 
   before them, an apparent suicide from hanging. Mark doesn't believe 
   it, telling Father Christopher that the man Martin was talking to 
   made him hang himself. Mark then has another vision, where a deformed 
   hand reaches out to grab him from under the stairs and then the man 
   with the cane slashes him on the face. When the vision is over, 
   Mark's face is bleeding, but once again, Christine doesn't believe 
   him. George then comes to the house to help Christine clean it up, 
   hoping to pull in some boarders and make some money in the process. 
   Then really strange shit happens to Mark. A ferry he is on catches 
   fire and a stranger named Dan (Yorga Yoyagis; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#VampireInVenice1988">VAMPIRE
    IN VENICE</A></B> - 1988), who looks just like the man with the 
   cane, saves him. Since the boardinghouse is all cleaned up and ready 
   for residents, Christine offers Dan the room of his choice. What room 
   does he pick? That's right, he picks Room 12. Mark gets very nervous, 
   because Whitsunday is coming up and he remembers Madeline warning him 
   about not letting anybody in the house, but Christine doesn't care 
   (no surprise there), she now runs the boardinghouse. Dan tells 
   Christine that the bulb in his room is too bright and comes on to 
   Christine, borrowing her scarf to put over the lampshade (Christine 
   mentions to Dan that she saw him on a bridge with a dog and he 
   doesn't seem too happy about that). Christine tells Mark that it's 
   Whitsunday and his beliefs are &quot;bullshit&quot; when Mark 
   mentions to her about Madeline's warning. While Mark is searching 
   Dan's room, looking for something to convince Christine that 
   Madeline's warning is true, Dan walks in and a widow opens and 
   shatters on Mark's face, but he is unhurt. Mark begs Father 
   Christopher to take him away, but it is becoming obvious that the 
   good Father knows all about the evil plans for Mark and Christine. To 
   make matters even worse, Christine breaks up with George and becomes 
   Dan's lover.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It also soon becomes rather obvious that it is Dan's job to get 
   Christine pregnant so she can have Satan's baby, but can Mark stop 
   it, as his visions become more frequent and he can finally see the 
   truth? Mark &quot;sees&quot; Dan kill Vicky, but she turns up alive, 
   making Christine more of a bitch than she usually is, if that is even 
   humanly possible. Dan then leaves the boardinghouse, telling 
   Christine he is leaving Venice because of Mark's constant accusations 
   against him, but Christine is already pregnant (Father Christopher 
   knows about the pregnancy before Christine does. Now she can blame 
   her cuntly outbursts on the pregnancy!), but she denies Dan is the 
   father (She tells Father Christopher, &quot;He can't be. I never went 
   to bed with him, if you know what I mean.&quot;). Christine marries 
   George and tells him that the baby is his (Even though she won't have 
   sex with him on their wedding night, telling him to wait until after 
   the baby is born!). Since we don't care what happens to Christine (I 
   haven't seen a more despicable person in a film in a long, long 
   time), the question becomes: Will Mark convince George of the truth 
   and will he get his sight back after drinking from the well? As the 
   stain on the floor gets darker, Mark tries to stay alive, even though 
   nearly everyone else is against him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There is no doubt that this is a very weird film (a twisted and 
   thoroughly Italian take of <B><A HREF="rosemarys_baby_1968.htm">ROSEMARY'S
    BABY</A></B> - 1968), but is it any good? It all depends on your 
   tolerance for broadly written characters and outrageous plot devices, 
   put there just to make the film weird, as hardly any of them advance 
   the plot. Even Christine's delivery of the baby, which we think will 
   be dangerous and deadly, happens matter-of-factly, as she is on a 
   ferry, has a stomach cramp and drops the baby on the spot (and since 
   it is the Anti-Christ, it's a boy they name Alex). Director Ugo 
   Liberatore, who is best known as a screenwriter (<B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#MillStoneWomen1960">MILL
    OF THE STONE WOMEN</A></B> - 1960; <B><A HREF="journey_beneath_the_desert_1961.htm">JOURNEY

    TROJAN HORSE</A></B> - 1961; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Witch1966">THE WITCH</A></B>

   Gandus (<B><A HREF="no_way_out_1973.htm">NO WAY OUT</A></B> - 1973; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Macabre1980">MACABRE</A></B> 
   - 1980; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Madhouse">MADHOUSE</A></B> - 1981), 
   seems more interested in making the film as outrageous as he can, 
   rather than it making any sense and in that respect, it succeeds. But 
   even if I were blind, I wouldn't take the crap that Christine dishes 
   out (Hey, I had an older sister and I fully understand how bitchy 
   they can be, but, c'mon, Christine is a bitch with a capital 
   &quot;C&quot;!). She refuses to change one iota or believe a word 
   Mark says, even though she can see it is all coming true. And Mark? 
   He sees things clearer than anyone with 20/20 vision could ever 
   perceive! In those aspects, this film fails wildly, because even an 
   imbecile could understand what is going on here, but most of the 
   people in this film are worse than imbeciles, it's like they weren't 
   born with brains at all. So if you want to see weird for weird's 
   sake, by all means, you'll probably love this film, but if you want 
   coherence and a plot that's easy to follow, look somewhere else. Any 
   film by David Lynch will do because any one of them makes more sense 
   than this. About the only thing about this film I find memorable is 
   Pino Donaggio's haunting music score, a mixture of choral chants and 
   screaming violins.</FONT></FONT></P>

   the same director (H. Tjut Djalil, using the pseudonym &quot;John 
   Miller&quot; here and using &quot;Jalil Jackson&quot; on others), the 
   same Indonesian locales and the same twisted logic that could only 
   exist in some alternate universe. This film opens up in Jakarta <A HREF="dangerous_seductress_1992.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dangerous seductress dvd front small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="227" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>with
    a car chase between three diamond robbers and a cop with a chip on 
   his shoulders. When the robbers' car crashes, dismembering one's arm 
   and another's finger and spilling buckets of blood on the local 
   flora, a model called Linda (Kristin Ann) witnesses the whole thing 
   and is questioned by police. In a scene that can only be described a 
   surreal, the dismembered finger walks to a hidden amulet (with a 
   mirror in it) which swallows it up, the blood dripping from the 
   plants is ingested by the amulet and the bones of a long-dead witch 
   (Amy Weber) begin to re-attach themselves. Not quite fully developed 
   (she only has one good arm and leg, the other two just skeletal), the 
   witch beheads a nosy dog and sucks out all it's blood. She is then 
   grabbed by the hands of Hell and pulled underground! Meanwhile, in 
   Los Angeles, Linda's sister Suzy (Tonya Offer) is being raped and 
   brutalized by her boyfriend. She phones her sister who tells her to 
   come to Jakarta to stay with her. Suzy goes to Jakarta just as Linda 
   is sent to Bali on a modeling assignment.&nbsp; Suzy finds a book of 
   Indonesian spells given to Linda by an expert on local legends. Suzy 
   recites one of the spells and brings the witch to her full-length 
   mirror. The witch possesses Suzy and soon she is dressing in sexy 
   clothing, picking up men and draining them of all their blood. She 
   goes back to the mirror, slits her throat and feeds the blood (it 
   comes out in a tidal wave) to the witch on the other side of the 
   mirror. The cop becomes suspicious and meets his death when Suzy 
   levitates his car in mid-air and blows it up. The man who gave Linda 
   the spell book shows up in the nick of time to save Linda and Suzy, 
   only to be sucked in the mirror. When Suzy opens the amulet, she sees 
   the demonic face of the man. THE END. That's the best I can describe 
   this delirious exercise which is part horror, part travelogue, part 
   dance film and part model posing. There's plenty of blood, as one man 
   is speargunned through the leg and pinned to a wall while Suzy slices 
   him with a fish hook, three other horny men are slaughtered by meat 
   hook and cleaver in meat locker and Suzy's abusive boyfriend (who 
   tracks her down) is hung by his ankles and sliced and decapitated by 
   flying shards of glass. It's all rather disjointed (just like <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Lady Terminator">LAD</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Lady Terminator">Y</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Lady Terminator"> TERMINATO</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Lady Terminator">R</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">)
    and the English spoken could only come from the pages of Indonesian 
   writers who think this is the way Americans actually talk. That's 
   part of it's charm. Another is the little bits of lunacy that occur 
   throughout the film: The American diamond robber continuously 
   slugging his driver while being chased in the beginning of the film 
   is knee-slapping funny; the way the decapitated finger walks is also 
   hilarious; the jazz score during the robbery chase is definitely out 
   of place; the sex scenes have all the men still wearing their 
   underwear, and some of the effects are truly priceless, especially 
   the witch's reincarnation. This all adds up to a really weird 
   experience which all of us need every once in a while. One caveat: 
   The version on DVD released by <A HREF="http://www.mondomacabrodvd.com">Mondo
    Macabro</A> optically censors the female nudity by placing white

   by <A HREF="http://www.midnight1.com">Midnight Video</A> does not 
   optically censor the nudity. It really doesn't hurt the film as

   about a funeral supply salesman named Bob Marley (Mark Miller, and, 
   no, he doesn't have dreadlocks) who makes his first delivery to the 
   creepy Hillcrest Inn, which doubles as both an Inn and a mortuary 
   (who the hell would stay there?), both run by the equally creepy Doc 
   (Edgar Allan Poe IV, and, yes, he is related) and his beautiful 
   granddaughter Billie Jo (Kerstin Steinback). Romantic sparks fly 
   between the nerdy Bob and cute Billie Jo (they both share an interest 
   in big hairy spiders) and Billie Jo talks him into taking a room at

   led by the dastardly Johnny Burns (Todd Kimsey) and his girlfriend 
   Kelly (Jessica Russo), pick the Hillcrest Inn to hide-out in for a 
   couple of days. It's apparent that Doc, who is a wheelchair-bound 
   paraplegic, welcomes the company of the criminals, as he begins 
   playing mind games with them using his black magic powers. One of the

    go out...&quot; to him while they sway to the music. Johnny rapes 
   and kills Billie Jo (offscreen), beats the crap out of Bob and then 
   slashes Kelly to death with a strait razor when she disobeys him. Doc 
   and his wheelchair disappear, so Johnny sends his goons to find him, 
   while Bob brings Billie Jo's dead body down to the mortuary and 
   revives her with a magical white powder created by Doc. Bob is the 
   next to die when he challenges Johnny to a fight and loses (badly). 
   When Johnny discovers that Doc was just in the bathroom taking a crap 
   (!), Doc convinces Johnny and his gang to stay for a s&eacute;ance 
   that he holds for a bunch of old broads every week. Meanwhile, Billie 
   Jo has reanimated Bob with the white powder and they join the 
   s&eacute;ance, much to the surprise of a shocked Johnny. At the 
   s&eacute;ance, a possessed Billie Jo rips a Devil tattoo off of 
   Johnny's forearm and throws it on the middle of the table, where it 
   transforms into a lifesize skeletal Devil (complete with wings), 
   forcing Johnny and his gang to split up and flee into different parts 
   of the inn/mortuary. The first one to die is Pyles (Julian Chachula 
   Jr.), whose hands become possessed and he blows his brains out. After 
   chopping-up Pyles' possessed body with a machete, Hernando (Stuart 
   Barron) is killed by the skeletal Devil. Jackson tries to escape 
   through the graveyard, but is captured by some zombies and hanged by 
   his neck. Only Johnny seemingly escapes, but three months later, he 
   is gunned down and his car blown up by a gang that are the spitting 
   image of his dead comrades. A twist ending reveals that Johnny may 
   have gotten his hands on Doc's magic white powder. Doc has got some 
   'splaining to do!&nbsp; This half-baked horror comedy, directed by 
   Jim Goodman (his only feature directorial credit) and written by 
   Henry Lindley, has some effective scenes but is for the most part a 
   hit-or-miss affair, with more misses than hits. The standout 
   performer here is Edgar Allan Poe IV as Doc, who is creepy as hell 
   whether he is spitting out metaphysical dialogue or returning from a 
   particularly odorous bathroom break. The inn/mortuary is another 
   creepy plus, with its organic, vine-filled hallways and dusty air. 
   You can almost feel the chilly draft and choke on the musty air as 
   the characters navigate the building. The minuses, on the other hand, 
   are many, as most of the other performers couldn't act their way out 
   of a traffic ticket, there are too many comic sound effects (when 
   someone gets hit on the head, we hear birds tweeting, just like in 
   cartoons), and most of the dialogue goes way beyond metaphysical and 
   borders on pretentiousness (At one point in the film, Billie Jo and 
   Bob quote verbatim the lyrics of Meat Loaf's song &quot;Paradise By 
   The Dashboard Lights&quot; as they confess their love for each other. 
   I half-expected the Loaf to make a cameo appearance to wipe both 
   their brows with his sweaty doo-rag, but no such luck). There are a 
   few creative makeup effects on view, but most of the bloodshed is 
   purposely left out of camera range (Johnny's bloody demise is an 
   exception). There is also female nudity on view, but none of it is 
   very titillating (ahem) unless the sight of naked corpses turn you on 
   (You sick fucking bastard!). There is a nice topless scene towards 
   the end when a (very beautiful) girl rises from a lake and kisses 
   Johnny, but it, too, turns perverse very quickly. When all is said

   some hallucinogenic slaughterhouse of a zoo), resulting in a major 
   lay-off of all the workers at the farm, who stand in mass outside the 
   farm, throwing insults (and sometimes objects) at Anna, Marco and 
   Anna's younger (and pretty) cousin/secretary Gabrielle (Ewa Aulin; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DeathSmilesMurder73">DEATH

    Marco is a very unhappy man; not only is he broke, living off Anna's 
   vast fortune, but he has been saddled with a new employee, Mondaini 
   (Jean Sobieski; <B><A HREF="perversion_story_1969.htm">PERVERSION STORY</A></B> 
   - 1969), by the company's President (Conrad Anderson), who thinks the 
   business needs a marketing facelift to go along with the new 
   automation, telling Marco that Mondaini is a &quot;marketing 
   genius.&quot; Mondaini is also the peeping tom at the hotel, who saw 
   Marco kill the prostitute. Marco is also madly in love with 
   Gabrielle, but she's the type of woman who judges a man by how much 
   money he has and since Marco has none, she sees no future with him, 
   saying to Marco, &quot;Love is a luxury&quot; (She's the typical 
   late-'60s golddigger, who lives in a pop culture world). One night, 
   Marco sneaks out of the bedroom (past a sleeping Anna) to have a 
   planned rendezvous with Gabrielle (whom he calls &quot;Gabi&quot;, so 
   I will, too), but she is not in her bedroom. He hears noises coming 
   from the chicken farm, so he goes to investigate, seeing nothing but 
   the headlights of a car driving away. He accidentally knocks over 
   some glass tubing in the laboratory located in the chicken farm, puts 
   it back where he thinks it belongs and goes back to bed. This one act 
   will change Marco forever and how it does is quite ingenious.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next morning, Marco asks Gabi where she was last night, as they 
   had agreed to be together. She tells him she had a splitting 
   headache, so she went looking for her pills, forgetting where she put 
   them (an obvious lie). Marco goes back to the laboratory and finds a 
   scarf (that wasn't in the lab last night when he was there) that 
   contains strange symbols printed on it that Marco can't decipher, but 
   he becomes obsessed with it and stuffs it in his jacket pocket. A 
   scientist (Biagio Pelligra; <B><A HREF="action.htm#RomeArmedTeeth">ROME:
    ARMED TO THE TEETH</A></B> - 1976) enters the lab and tells Marco 
   that someone broke into the lab last night, saying that if anyone 
   messed with the top secret experiment he is working on, it could mean 
   the extinction of the next generation of chickens and the end of 
   Anna's poultry empire. Marco tells him he will look into the matter 
   and leaves the laboratory, meeting Gabi at an open-air cafe. He 
   notices she is wearing a scarf with the same strange symbols on it 
   and shows her the one he took from the lab, asking her if she knows 
   who it belongs to. Gabi says she got hers from Anna's wardrobe 
   closet, she always borrows her clothes, but she has no idea where the 
   scarf in the lab came from, telling Marco he should talk to his wife.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We can see that Marco's mind is unravelling, as we see his thoughts 
   as rapid-fire images (a remarkable editing job by this film's 
   co-writer, Franco Arcalli [<B><A HREF="black_jesus_1968.htm">BLACK JESUS</A></B> 
   - 1968]). We see a burning overturned car with a dead body lying next 
   to it, as a woman with a bloody face walks towards the camera; 
   numerous close-ups of chickens (Man they are ugly birds, especially 
   when you see them this close!); numerous shots of traffic on the 
   highway and numerous other images, all showing us how badly Marco's 
   mind is deteriorating and how he is about to snap. The turning point 
   comes when Marco discovers Gabi is having a love affair with 
   Mondaini, Gabi telling Marco that Mondaini is young, handsome and 
   successful (i.e. he has money), all the things Marco isn't. When 
   Mondaini shows Marco his ideas for the new marketing campaign, where 
   cartoon chickens are dressed like humans and doing human things (like 
   going to cocktail parties), we can see that Mondaini is pushing Marco 
   past the breaking point, but is he doing it on purpose? Damn right he 
   is! (The marketing campaign is hilariously bad, but very humorous in 
   its execution!). Rather than killing Mondaini right there and then, 
   Marco makes a trip to the ultra-mod hotel, pays the hotel manager 
   (Giulio Donnini; <B><A HREF="danger_diabolik_1968.htm">DANGER: DIABOLIK</A></B> 
   - 1968) to pick out a prostitute from the hotel bar that meets 
   Marco's criteria and give her a key to his room, where Marco murders 
   her with his knife while wearing black leather gloves, all of which 
   he keeps in his business briefcase.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Anna throws a party at her mansion, where Mondaini comes up with the 
   idea to clear out a room of all its furnishings and belongings so 
   that it is just a room with four white walls and nothing else; he 
   then has two people, a man and a woman, go inside the room and close 
   the door; not to come out until they discover the true meaning of 
   &quot;love&quot; (It's a strange game but it makes sense in a very 
   perverse way!). For some people. it's a rather quick experience, as 
   they come out either smiling or crying, but when Gabi and Mondaini 
   spent too much time in the room for Marco's liking, he throws a fit 
   and the party ends. After everyone leaves, Anna finds an envelope 
   with her name on it and when she reads the note inside, it's her turn 
   to have a fit. The note tells her that Marco is a serial killer of 
   prostitutes and details his exploits at the hotel. Anna asks Gabi who 
   would write such lies about her husband, but Anna is asking the wrong 
   person. That's right, Gabi and Mondaini are not only lovers, they 
   plan on murdering Anna and Marco so Gabi can inherit Anna's fortune 
   and the &quot;world will belong&quot; to them. The note was just the 
   first step to turn Anna against Marco to make their deaths look like 
   a murder/suicide by cop, but will they be successful?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In what has to be the films best WTF?!? moment, we see the new 
   generation of chickens hatch and Marco is disgusted to see to see 
   that they are living headless and wingless chickens (!!!) with very 
   little bone structure that grow quickly without being fed (!!!!!!). 
   Both Anna and the scientist who created them are quite pleased, 
   saying this will revolutionize the way chickens are raised and 
   marketed and it means a fortune will be made for Anna's business 
   since she owns the patent. Marco is outraged, saying these 
   abominations go against God, so he destroys the headless/wingless 
   wonders (that look like pulsating brains with chicken legs!). Marco 
   gets chewed-out by the company President, so he quits, thinking this 
   is his chance to start a new life, but first he makes one last trip 
   to his favorite hotel. He doesn't know that Gabi has talked Anna into 
   dressing like a prostitute and confronting Marco in his regular hotel 
   room, Room 724, which he rents out on a monthly basis. Anna pays the 
   hotel manager to phone her with the next day and time her husband 
   will be using Room 724. When that day comes, Marco finds Anna dead in 
   Room 724, her throat cut by Mondaini, who goes to work with two huge 
   scratch marks on his face, put there by Anna, who was fighting for 
   her life, but lost the battle. Gabi phones the police and tells them 
   to go to Room 724 immediately; they will find a murdered woman and 
   her killer there. What Gabi and Mondaini (as well as us) don't 
   realize is things were never what they seemed to be. When the police 
   arrive at the hotel and tell the manager that someone reported a 
   murder in Room 724, all of Marco's previous &quot;victims&quot; 
   appear and laugh, telling the Police Inspector (Aldo Bonamano; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DeepRed1975">DEEP
    RED</A></B> - 1975) that it's all a weird &quot;game&quot; played by 
   &quot;a nice man who wouldn't hurt a fly&quot; (One prostitute says, 
   &quot;I was murdered in that room at least four times this 
   month!&quot;). That's right, Marco never murdered anyone, it was all 
   a sex game between him and the prostitutes; he paid each of them a 
   large amount of money to play along with him (Which is why, if you 
   think about it, there were no stories or reports of a serial killer 
   being on the loose). When the police enter Room 724, it is empty; 
   Marco has put Anna's body in his car and is driving to the chicken 
   farm, looking to dump her body in the new industrial chicken food 
   grinder and getting rid of her body without a trace of it being left 
   for the police to discover. I'm not going to tell you how the film 
   ends. Let's just say that nearly everyone gets their just desserts 
   and the ending will make you think long and hard about what the next 
   generation of chickens may look like. The final image will not only 
   make you laugh, it will also make you think. This late-'60s

   never be bored, as Questi and co-writer Franco Arcalli (who co-wrote<A HREF="death_laid_an_egg_1968.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/death laid an egg italy poster4b small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   and edited all three of Questi's feature films) fills this film with 
   images delivered in jackhammer style, making things quite ordinary 
   (such as highway traffic, billboards and the outside of the ultra-mod 
   hotel) seem dangerous and extraordinary. Questi's pop art sensibility 
   really shines here, as does <A HREF="death_laid_an_egg_1968.htm#OST">Bruno
    Maderna's music score</A>, which is not music in the general sense, 
   but rather a cacaphony of sounds, such as cymbal crashes, breakage 
   and other noises signifying Marco losing his grip on reality. It's a 
   shame that Questi didn't make more films, but I can guess that as the 
   1960's ended and everything started to change (for the worse), 
   including the way we look at sex, drugs, love and war, Questi lost 
   interest in making films, turning his attention towards television 
   until his death in 2014 at the age of 90. And we are all the worse 
   off for it. Believe me, I have only mentioned about ten percent of 
   what actually happens in this film, but I will say this: After 
   watching this film, you may never eat chicken again. This is a 
   classic of its short-live genre; a film, that once seen, is never forgotten.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   available in two versions: The original Italian cut and a shorter 
   edit for American audiences (because, you know, we need protecting!), 
   shorn of nearly 20 minutes of footage with outtakes not used in the 
   Italian version to pad it out. I will be reviewing the longer Italian

   from the American edit.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We see criminal psychologist/police consultant Dr. Herbert Lyutak 
   (Mickey Hargitay; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LadyFrankenstein">LADY FRANKENSTEIN</A></B> 
   - 1971) eyeing a pretty young girl in the Red Garter Bar, as she is 
   dancing in a short miniskirt to some funky music playing on the 
   jukebox (this film's unusual music score is supplied by Gianfranco 
   Reverberi; <B><A HREF="django_prepare_a_coffin_1968.htm">DJANGO, 
   PREPARE A COFFIN</A></B> - 1968). He hears her tell her boyfriend 
   over the phone that she doesn't know where the nightclub he is 
   performing at is located, so Herbert tells her he knows where it is, 
   it is near where he lives and offers her a ride, which she gladly 
   accepts. Big mistake. As he is driving, the girl begins to get 
   nervous at the way he is staring at her thighs, so she tries to lower 
   her skirt (good luck trying that with a miniskirt!). She also notices 
   that they are on a deserted back road and begs Herbert not to hurt 
   her, but he grabs her crotch and refuses to let go. Herbert then 
   stops the car and tells the girl to get out and run away as fast as 
   she can because he doesn't want to hurt her. She takes his advice, 
   jumps out of the car and begins to run away, but Herbert's lust gets 
   the best of him and he runs after her, catching her in a shallow 
   river, where he tears off her clothes, puts his hands around her neck 
   and then beats her to death with a tree branch.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A short time later, Police Inspector Edwards (Raul Lovecchio; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Blood&amp;Diamonds1977">BLOOD
    AND DIAMONDS</A></B> - 1977), his assistant Willy (William Darni) 
   and police officer Richard (Max Dorian; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#KidnapSyndicate">KIDNAP
    SYNDICATE</A></B> - 1975) are at the crime scene with Herbert, who 
   is helping the police with a series of vicious murders of pretty 
   young women, whom are found dead and naked, but not sexually 
   assaulted. The police are completely unaware that the killer is 
   actually Herbert, but is he the only serial killer at large? 
   Apparently not, for as Herbert is helping the Inspector with his 
   investigation, another young woman is viciously assaulted and killed 
   in a phone booth at a park, the exact same method used by Herbert! 
   The police pull in four men from the area who have no reason for 
   being in the park at night and one man, John Lacey (Tano Cimarosa; 
   director of the giallo film <B><A HREF="reflections_in_black_1975.htm">REFLECTIONS
    IN BLACK</A></B> - 1975), looks guilty as hell, but he tells the 
   Inspector that he used the park grounds to take a shit (!) and he can 
   collect the &quot;evidence&quot; on the ground where he dropped it 
   (He also has blood on his shirt, which he tells the Inspector is from 
   a nose bleed. That must have been one violent shit!). Lacey is 
   arrested, but is soon let go for lack of evidence (we never find out 
   if he actually pinched a loaf!), the Inspector assigning Richard to 
   follow and keep a close eye on him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then discover that Herbert is impotent and his loving wife, 
   Marcia (Rita Calderoni; <B><A HREF="#QuietPlaceCountry68">A QUIET 
   PLACE IN THE COUNTRY</A></B> - 1968), is still a virgin! She has an 
   inkling that her husband is the serial killer, but she loves him so 
   much, she is willing to overlook it! Marcia also has violent 
   nightmares, where she and housekeeper Laurel (Cristina Perrier), 
   along with Herbert's niece, Joaquine (Christa Barrymore), have 
   lesbian sex in a dungeon, while Herbert is chained up and forced to 
   watch them, having some type of conniption fit as he watches his wife 
   go at it with two other women (We know that Laurel is also a little 
   unhinged, as she graphically masturbates while she secretly listens 
   to Herbert and Marcia proclaim their love for each other!). The past 
   two days have been so busy, Herbert forgot to give his wife a card he 
   wrote for her for their anniversary, so he hands it to her. The card 
   says that he thinks they should separate because he is impotent and 
   it is not fair for her since she is a wife and still a virgin! Marcia 
   tells Herbert no, she still loves him and he can do anything he wants 
   to her, fully aware of his violent sexual tendencies. He begins 
   kissing her and her moans of pleasure make him put his hands around 
   her throat and begin choking her. He then turns her over on her 
   stomach, pulls a circular metal object out of a lockbox (I tried 
   several times to find out what the object was, with no success. It 
   looks like a sharp metal dildo!), slices her back with it and then 
   sodomizes her with it! When he realizes what he is doing, he stops 
   himself, looks in the mirror and says, &quot;Enough, Herbert! You are 
   a hyena! Hyena!&quot; Marcia keeps telling Herbert, &quot;I love you! 
   You can do anything you want to me! I love you Herbert!&quot; Herbert 
   can't face himself another day, so he comes up with a way to get 
   caught in the act of killing a young woman. He phones the Inspector 
   and tells him he has created an extensive &quot;metereopsychic&quot; 
   profile of the killer (What??? Does this actually exist???) and that 
   he knows where the serial killer will strike next (at the park), so 
   all he has to do is put a female cop as a decoy and wait for the 
   killer to strike. The Inspector agrees and puts the plan into action. 
   What Herbert doesn't know is that Marcia heard the phone call. 
   Needless to say, none of this is going to go down that way it was planned.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The female cop used as a decoy is Miss Heindrich (Katia Cardinali; 
   Polselli's <B><A HREF="house_of_love_the_police_intervene_1973-1977.htm">HOUSE
    OF LOVE...THE POLICE INTERVENE</A></B> - 1978), who was once a 
   patient of Herbert's. While the Inspector, Willy and Richard keep a 
   close eye on Miss Heindrich, they don't notice that John Lacey is 
   also in the park. As Herbert approaches Miss Heindrich, fully intent 
   on killing her, another prostitute in the park is murdered by someone 
   wearing a gorilla mask (!), spoiling Herbert's plans. They all rush 
   to the crime scene after hearing the woman's screams and see the 
   prostitute's naked dead body, but Miss Heindrich sees the murder 
   weapon on the ground and takes it before the Inspector can see it (or 
   so she thought). Later that night, Miss Heindrich phones Herbert's 
   house and talks to Marcia, telling her to have Herbert call her as 
   soon as possible, she found something on the ground that she 
   recognized and she wants Herbert to see it before she turns it over 
   to the Inspector. Later on, someone wearing black gloves and wielding 
   a whip, enters Miss Heindrich's apartment and begins whipping her and 
   ends up drowning Miss Heindrich in her own bathtub (It has the bluest 
   water I have ever seen!), using the whip's handle to masturbate Miss 
   Heindrich as she dies! When the Inspector and Willy get to Miss 
   Heindrich's apartment, they find her naked and dead on the bathroom 
   windowsill and when Willy goes to collect her body, it falls a couple 
   of floors to the pavement below (if she wasn't dead, she is now!) and 
   the Inspector chews-out Willy for not being careful.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    John Lacey followed the killer from the park back to a secret 
   entrance to Herbert's house in the basement. He watches the killer 
   try to murder Laurel (with a hotshot of morphine and then being 
   gassed with propane! There is also a quite graphic masturbation 
   sequence that will make many people uncomfortable). Joaquine locks 
   Lacey in the basement, but he gets free, turns off the gas and calls 
   the Inspector from Herbert's office. The Inspector puts a trace on 
   the phone call when Lacey refuses to tell him where he is, only 
   saying that he has proof that will free him. Herbert comes home and 
   sees a note on the door written by Joaquine saying that she trapped 
   someone in the basement. A fight breaks out between Lacey and Herbert 
   and Lacey is knocked out and arrested by the Inspector. Laurel is 
   still alive (thanks to Lacey) and may be able to finger the serial 
   killer, so the Inspector lets Laurel stay at Herbert's house under 
   his care until she wakes up. A short time later, Laurel disappears, 
   making Marcia and Joaquine very nervous. Is it possible one of these 
   women is also the copycat serial killer, murdering young women to get 
   the heat off Herbert? Count on it! The final denouement is a 
   cacophony of hysterics, something that is better seen than explained. 
   It involves someone swinging a mace and someone getting impaled in 
   the chest by a metal rake, as the Inspector and Willy try to find a 
   way into Herbert's house.</FONT></FONT></P>

    That basically explains the Italian cut, but let's get to the 
   differences between the Italian and American edits, which are quite substantial.</FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B>*</B>The
    Italian cut runs 102 minutes. The American version runs 85 minutes, 
   shortening some scenes and replacing others completely with scenes 
   that ended up on the cutting room floor.</FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B>*</B>In
    the American version, it opens with footage of the war in Vietnam, 
   as we watch Herbert smash a Cong soldier in the face over-and-over 
   with the butt of his rifle. Herbert is then shot in the groin, put on 
   a helicopter and is put under the care of nurse Marcia. They then 
   fall in love with each other. It helps explain his impotency and why 
   they love each other, something that is missing in the Italian cut. 
   The film then continues with the opening of the Italian edit in the 
   Red Garter Bar, only the whole sequence is much shorter and the 
   dialogue is different. The young girl's murder is also shortened of 
   some graphic nudity.</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B>*</B>The
    phone booth murder is much shorter.</FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B>*</B>The
    line-up sequence is shorter, cutting out two British bobbies (The 
   Italian version takes place in London, but the American cut wants us 
   to believe it is some small town in the U.S., but the presence of the 
   red wooden phone booth tells you differently!). It also eliminates 
   Lacey's &quot;taking a shit&quot; remark.</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B>*</B>Marcia's
    nightmares are longer and her back slicing and sodomy by metal dildo 
   are missing. Also missing is Herbert's &quot;Hyena&quot; dialogue. It 
   is replaced by, &quot;That's enough! That's enough! Do you 
   hear?!?&quot; and when he looks in the mirror, he has 'Nam flashbacks.</FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B>*</B>Miss

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B>*</B>In

    finale is completely different (I like it better than the Italian 
   version). One character dies differently at the barrel of the 
   Inspector's gun. The ending is one for the books: We see Herbert 
   dying on the helicopter in Vietnam and everything we have just 
   witnessed was all in Herbert's mind, proving you could live a full

    To hell with linear storytelling, if you like films that are as far 
   off the wall as they can get, there is no one better at it than 
   Renato Polselli. He seemingly lived on another planet completely 
   different than ours, which are why his movies are as far removed from 
   reality as they can possibly get. But this is his strength, not a 
   weakness, which is why his films are such a trip to watch. Don't come 
   looking for common sense, because you will be disappointed. Be 
   prepared for the strange, so just sit back, relax and take it all in. 
   No need for a controlled substance here. This is the filmic 
   equivalent of THC and you'll be laughing in no time, whether you want 
   to or not. You won't be able to control yourself. And that's the 
   genius of Renato Polselli.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   - 1998), who shares directing/producing/screenwriting chores with 
   Jerry Younkins, who never made another film thanks to the experience 
   of making this one. The film opens with black magic practitioner 
   Laval Blessing (Christmas Robbins, who lost a finger prior to making 
   this movie, which is why he wears a strange leather glove-like object 
   on his left hand) calling forth a demon, which slaughters Pamela (who 
   wakes up from a nightmare, grabs the keys to her AMC Gremlin and 
   drives it to the middle of the woods while still wearing her 
   nightie!) and drags her bloody body through the forest. The film 
   switches to earlier that night (it doesn't state so, but after 
   watching the film a few times, it's the only thing that makes sense) 
   to a party at Laval's castle, where a guy who looks just like Frank 
   Zappa lets the sarcastic Damian (Val Mayerik) into the house. Damian 
   complains about everything he sees (except the two overweight and 
   ugly people doing the Bump in the living room while generic rock 
   music plays), while Laval tries to talk Damian's girlfriend, Pamela, 
   into joining him in a sexual magic ritual (both Laval and Pamela are 
   sitting in a pyramid-like tent set-up in one of the upstairs 
   bedrooms!). Pamela freaks-out in front of everyone and we learn that 
   this is not only a party, it is also one of Laval's regularly 
   scheduled coven meetings, where he imparts nuggets of wisdom (and a 
   little black magic knowledge) to his followers while he has sex with 
   the female members. Only this time Damian and the rest of the coven 
   (who all have last names of well-known comics artists, horror 
   directors and cult personalities, like Gould, Corben, Ormsby, Romero 
   and Ackerman) are having none of Laval's nonsense and want to stop 
   the orgies and pseudo-supernatural shenanigans. Damian doesn't 
   believe Laval is the real thing, so he leads Pamela and the rest of 
   the coven out the front door in a mass exodus (but not before Laval 
   slaps Damian across the face with his gloved hand and ominously says, 
   &quot;You mess with the bull, you get the horns!&quot;). Laval 
   decides to get even with his followers, so he performs a ritual in 
   his black magic room (complete with a pentagram on the floor, a huge 
   crucifix with a human head attached to it on the wall and a totally 
   nude woman sprawled and writhing on the floor!) and calls forth a 
   horned demon (David J. Howard, in a ridiculous get-up) to kill all 
   those who mocked him at the party. The demon has no choice but to 
   follow Laval's orders, but it warns Laval, &quot;I will kill you! I 
   will kill you!&quot; after all the partygoers and coven members are 
   dead. When Pamela's body is found torn apart in the woods, Detective 
   Frazetta (Tom Hutton, who is simply a horrible actor) begins 
   interviewing Pamela's friends, beginning with Elaine Ormsby (Linda 
   Conrad), who refuses to cooperate and is shortly killed by her friend 
   Janis Romero (Kathy Stewart), who becomes possessed after Elaine 
   kills her with her own possessed car (This is getting confusing!) and 
   she bloodily tears Elaine apart when Elaine tries to <A HREF="devil_master_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/devil master vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="164" HEIGHT="269" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>drive
    her to the hospital. Damian has a &quot;gut feeling&quot; that Laval 
   is involved (No shit, Sherlock!), while Detective Frazetta and his 
   wife seek advice from Professor Peckinpah (<B><A HREF="texas_chainsaw_massacre_1974.htm">TEXAS
    CHAINSAW MASSACRE</A></B>'s Gunnar Hansen in a useless cameo), an 
   expert on the occult. Damian phones-in an anonymous tip to Detective 
   Frazetta that he must talk to Laval, so Frazetta drives to Laval's 
   castle and interviews him (<B>Laval</B> [when he realizes Frazetta is 
   a cop]<B>:</B> &quot;I quit using that stuff two years ago!&quot; <B>Frazetta:</B> 
   &quot;Hey, I don't care if you drop Bufferin in your tea!&quot;). 
   When the rest of the girls are slaughtered by the demon at a pot 
   party, the guys and Detective Frazetta head to Laval's castle, where 
   everyone dies except Frazetta (he goes mad) and the demon keeps his 
   promise and kills Laval before disappearing in a puff of smoke.&nbsp; 
   I won't prattle on-and-on about how bad this film really is. That's 
   already a given. There are sequences here which serve no other 
   purpose than filler, such as the sequence where Laval goes to karate 
   class and then immediately thereafter gets into a (very badly 
   choreographed) bar fight with a bunch of patrons (the whole sequence 
   seems to be inserted to stroke Christmas Robbins' ego), the scene 
   where Garrett Adams (Michael McGivern) and his male friends stiff a 
   gas station attendant out of $5.00 or the scene where Susan Ackerman 
   (Susan Bullen) and her female friends get stoned and have a whipped 
   cream fight with cans of Readi Whip. There are scenes of bloody gore 
   (pitchfork through the neck, throat rippings, axe to the back, Alex 
   Redondo [Phil Foreman] stabbing himself in the chest over-and-over 
   with a dagger, and the film's highlight, where Paul [the guy who 
   looks like Frank Zappa] is shot in the groin with a crossbow bolt and 
   he writhes and screams in pain on the floor while his friends just 
   stare at him!), but they are so badly filmed, they lack any impact.

   young boy named Roscoe (Emmett Eckert) is visited nightly by a demon 
   named Dimwos (John Chatham), a creature from another dimension with 
   big horns sticking out of his head who speaks to Roscoe in a language 
   we can't understand. Roscoe's only friend, Eva (Grace Kilgore), is 
   the only one who believes him about being visited by Dimwos and his 
   art teacher Barbara (Melanie Richardson) has some psychic connection 
   to Dimwos and the only way she can get him out of her head is to draw 
   pictures of him and other demons (I know, I don't understand it, 
   either!). One night Roscoe's parents are killed in their beds (all we 
   see is their burned indentations in the mattress) and Dimwos tells 
   Roscoe to go down a red hole in the ground, where something happens 
   to Roscoe (but more about that later). Years pass and an adult Roscoe 
   (Sizemore, who looks like Jesus Christ) emerges out of the hole 
   barefoot and shirtless, with only tatters left as pants. He steals a 
   camper's backpack and finds a pair of jeans and a shirt that fit him 
   perfectly (what are the chances?) and heads to his parent's home, 
   which is now abandoned and empty of most furniture (except a lamp!). 
   It's apparent that Roscoe has gained some supernatural powers with 
   the time he spent in the hole, because all he has to do is raise his 
   hand and the light goes on. He then starts to remember what happened 
   with all the years he spent in that hole. Dimwos teaches him the dark 
   ways and says such mindbending things to him like, &quot;Each of us 
   were raised in dark wombs.&quot; and &quot;You will become Master of 
   the Three Vessels&quot;. They speak to each other in that strange 
   language (which is now English subtitled) and as Roscoe grows older, 
   he asks for more power, which Dimwos gives to him by breathing 
   something into his mouth. Big mistake. Roscoe ends up shattering the 
   three vessels, which each held a demon with extraordinary evil powers 
   and one of the demons rips off Dimwos' head. And they followed Roscoe 
   out of the hole and are now walking the Earth. It first starts to go 
   wrong when one of the demons, Ogrom (Josh Adam Gould), turns 
   Barbara's soon-to-be fianc&eacute; (also played by Gould) into a 
   mutant creature called Owrefewl, who chows down on his three friends 
   (this is where the film becomes extremely gory) and then goes after 
   Barbara, who manages to keep him away for a while by drawing more 
   pictures, but he eventually gets to her and bites a healthy chunk out 
   of her neck, killing her. Another demon, Rolmortus (Dustin Dorough), 
   possesses the campers (the ones who Roscoe stole the backpack from) 
   and they start killing each other in gory ways (the hardest part to 
   watch was the guitar player strumming the strings so hard that his 
   fingernails tear off!), including neck-snapping, rock bashing, slit 
   throats and one girl cutting open her stomach until all her innards 
   fall to the ground. The third demon, Valurga (Sade Smith), the only 
   female demon and the most powerful, raises a bunch of zombies from a 
   graveyard and the first thing they do is attack a grown Eva's 
   (Ashleigh Jo Sizemore, real-life wife of James Sizemore) father, 
   tearing him apart and eating his intestines, while Eva pulls out a 
   rifle and shoots one of them in the head (a POV shot of Eva through 
   the giant hole in the zombie's head), but these are not ordinary 
   zombies because head shots don't kill them and they chase Eva, who 
   manages to jump in her pickup and escape. She nearly runs over Roscoe 
   and, at first, can't believe it is him until he mentions something 
   from their childhood that only the two of them would know (It has to 
   do with a clear marble that Eva gave Roscoe as a child, which he then 
   hid behind a brick in his attic. Don't try and make sense of it, just 
   go along!). Roscoe takes Eva back to his parents' house and 
   psychically explains what happens to him during his missing years 
   simply by touching hands (which also includes Roscoe being forced to 
   drink a gross bubbling pea soup-green liquid out of the ground to 
   give him powers and make him more passive in this other dimension, 
   while Dimwos teaches him the ways of being the Master of the Three 
   Vessels and obeying the &quot;Dark Mother&quot;, which we never see). 
   Eva is now on board to try and destroy the three demons. Meanwhile, 
   Valurga finds two bow hunters walking in the forest&nbsp; and 
   possesses one of them, who then shoots four arrows into his friend's 
   chest and then stops two girls in an SUV (One of them is his 
   girlfriend. What are the chances?), shoots an arrow in one girl's 
   chest, killing her, and then shooting an arrow into the other girls 
   foot, pinning her to the ground while the zombies tear her apart (one 
   bites her in the neck and stretches her skin like it was a piece of 
   cheese before it snaps off!). Roscoe defeats Ogrom after the demon 
   enters a house party (where everyone is yelling &quot;Cake! Cake! 
   Cake!&quot;) and makes three party girls strip naked and kneel before 
   him. Roscoe uses his supernatural <A HREF="demons_rook_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/demon's rook poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="169" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>powers
    to make Ogrom's head explode. There is much more gory fun on view 
   (including Valurga possessing everyone at a barn band party where a 
   band called &quot;Bovine Fantasy Invasion&quot; [actually a real band 
   called &quot;El Fossil&quot;] is playing and is probably the film's 
   non-stop gory highlight as dozens of people kill each other in 
   various graphic ways) as Roscoe shares his powers with Eva (the same 
   way Dimwos shared his with Roscoe) to battle the final two demons, 
   but unfortunately it is not a happy ending for our couple (although 
   it does end up being rather romantic). I won't say any more because 
   you should experience this film for yourself.&nbsp; It is clear James 
   Sizemore and his small crew (nearly everyone, including the actors 
   and technicians, do double, triple and more duty both in front and 
   behind the camera) were working with a small budget (it was filmed on 
   weekends over a two year period in Moreland, Georgia), but the 
   unrated gore for the most part is extremely well done (although some 
   of the blood spurting does not match up with the wounds) and the 
   makeup effects for the demons and the zombies are terrific (Sizemore 
   was self-taught and learned effects from watching tutorial videos). 
   The whole film plays like some fever dream and makes very little 
   sense, but once you get past the prologue with the young Roscoe, you 
   won't care, as it is a non-stop barrage of blood, gore and body 
   parts. Faces are ripped-off, innards are lovingly displayed and 
   eaten, heads explode and appendages yanked-off. The story is so 
   convoluted that you'll be scratching your head if you think about it 
   too much, especially the part where Owrefewl finds Roscoe's clear 
   marble behind the brick and drops it to the floor. The final shot has 
   the camera panning on that marble, so it must represent something, 
   but damned if I could figure it out. The only problem I really had 
   with this film is the sound (Due to noisy generators and the lack of 
   proper sound equipment, the film's sound work had to be done entirely 
   in post and within Sizemore's basement). Some of the dialogue is 
   recorded so low that you have to turn up the volume and then it 
   suddenly gets so loud, you have to turn it down again. You'll find 
   yourself doing this several times during the film, but, for the most 
   part, the dialogue is minimal and the majority of the film is just 
   non-stop killing. There are some funny inserts during the film's 
   final credits showing various animals eating the flesh of the 
   victims, zombies and dead demons and a final shot of a cat licking 
   the bloody fingers of the film's only surviving member (but I'm not 
   going to tell who it is) after the credits end. For a first feature 
   film, James Sizemore does a bloody good job, but he really has to 
   write a coherent screenplay the next time, not that I'm complaining 
   about this one. It is about as strange as a film can be and still be 
   enjoyed for all its old-school special effects (no CGI here). Highly 
   recommended for lovers of bizarre and extremely gory films. Also

   Morton, Elizabeth Murphy and Fritz J. Noble as Eva's father. A

   The film opens with ugly old hag Mother Gaut&egrave;re (Tota Alba; <B><A HREF="inquisition_1976.htm">INQUISITION</A></B> 
   - 1976) walking down the aisle of a church (the filmmakers like this

   in front of the pews by overturning the candle holders and destroying 
   the furniture. She then steals a holy chalice out of a cabinet and 
   leaves a lit candle at the feet of an odd-looking statue, which looks 
   to be a cat-like creature with horns sticking out of its head (Hey, 
   what kind of church is this?). We then see Father Juan (Juli&aacute;n 
   Mateos; <B><A HREF="cold_eyes_of_fear_1971.htm">THE COLD EYES OF FEAR</A></B> 
   - 1971) discussing the theft of the chalice with Police Commissioner

   black magic. Mr. Barnes replies that the only deviltry going on is of 
   the human kind and asks the good Father if he believes in such 
   mumbo-jumbo. Father Juan believes this theft is related to a male 
   baby who was kidnapped recently, but Mr. Barnes scoffs at such a 
   connection, stating the<A HREF="demon_witch_child_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/demon witch child vhs front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   baby was probably stolen by a mad, childless woman. Mother 
   Gaut&egrave;re also left a piece of root behind when she was in the 
   church, which Father Juan calls the &quot;Root of Magic&quot; and 
   tells Mr. Barnes that he believes something Satanic is going on. Mr. 
   Barnes assures the Father that the baby will be found and that the 
   chalice is probably in the hands of some unscrupulous antiques 
   dealer. Mr. Barnes asks Father Juan not to make his views public, 
   because the citizens are already on edge with the kidnapping. Mr. 
   Barnes says that he will pick up old hag Mother Gaut&egrave;re, who 
   is supposed to be a witch, to see if she has any information to offer 
   (&quot;I'll wring it out of her!&quot;), not knowing that Mother 
   Gaut&egrave;re is actually the culprit in both stealing the chalice 
   and kidnapping the baby. We are then briefly introduced to Mr. 
   Barnes' young, barely teenage daughter Susan (Mari&aacute;n Salgado; <B><A HREF="night_of_the_walking_dead_1975.htm">NIGHT
    OF THE WALKING DEAD</A></B> - 1975; who supplied Linda Blair's voice

   become an integral part of the film. The Police Chief (Fernando 
   Sancho; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Swamp Ravens">SWAMP OF THE RAVENS</A></B> 
   - 1974) arrests Mother Gaut&egrave;re (who is doing a Tarot Card 
   reading), but she says her &quot;Master&quot; will protect her. As 
   they are driving away, a nameless young gypsy witch (Kali Hansa; <B><A HREF="sinister_eyes_of_dr_orloff_1973.htm">THE
    SINISTER EYES OF DR. ORLOFF</A></B> - 1973) curses the Police 
   Commissioner, the Police Chief and the entire police force. The Chief 
   sweats Mother Gaut&egrave;re, even bringing in the missing baby boy's 
   mother to beg, &quot;For the love of God, my lady, return my son to 
   me!&quot; Mother Gaut&egrave;re callously replies. &quot;Shut up, 
   bitch! Don't you call me your lady and don't invoke your God. You'll 
   never see him again. He'll be sacrificed to the Great Master!&quot; 
   (Well, so much for being innocent!). As the missing boy's mother is 
   dragged away still pleading for her baby's life, the Police Chief 
   threatens to use truth serum on Mother Gaut&egrave;re to get her to 
   tell him the location of the baby, but she tries to commit suicide by 
   jumping out the window and landing on the pavement below. Even though 
   she is bleeding profusely from her head, she is still alive and taken 
   to the hospital. The young gypsy witch gives Susan an evil-looking 
   idol, which she hides in her teddy bear. She also gives Susan a 
   cursed necklace and as soon as she puts it around Susan's neck, her 
   happy-go-lucky attitude suddenly changes, and when her nanny, Anne 
   Crawford (Lone Fleming; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#It Happened Nightma">IT
    HAPPENED AT NIGHTMARE INN</A></B>, a.k.a. <B><A HREF="candle_for_the_devil_1970_blu-ray.htm">A
    CANDLE FOR THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1973), who is in a park with her 
   fianc&eacute;, newspaper reporter William Grant (Daniel Martin; <B><A HREF="devils_kiss_1976.htm">DEVIL'S
    KISS</A></B> - 1976), asks Susan where she got such an ugly 
   necklace, Susan blurts out, &quot;You're horrible! You're pigs! You 
   let him do dirty things to you! You're both filthy dogs!&quot; (That 
   may be the truth, but did she have to be so blunt?). Later that 
   night, Mother Gaut&egrave;re dies in the hospital and we see her 
   ghost rise from her hospital bed and travel to Susan's bedroom, where 
   she enters Susan's body while she sleeps (This is all done using 
   double exposure photography, but this simple technique works well 
   here and it is very creepy). An invisible force pulls the bed covers 
   off of Susan (who is still asleep) and she levitates in the air (If 
   you look closely at the wall behind Susan, you'll be able to figure 
   out how this effect was achieved). Mr. Barnes is surprised that Susan 
   didn't say goodnight to him before she went to bed, so he goes to her 
   bedroom and gives a sleeping Susan a kiss on the cheek, but when he 
   leaves, we discover that Susan was only pretending she was asleep, as 
   she wipes off his kiss with her hand in disgust, while the eyes of 
   the idol in her teddy bear glow red. We then watch as the young gypsy 
   witch performs a satanic ritual with her faithful flock of Devil 
   worshippers. She orders Susan to &quot;Come, come, come, 
   imeeeeediately!&quot; and Susan rises rises from her bed in a 
   trance-like state, where she walks to the ritual, kneels before the 
   gypsy witch, renounces God and all he stands for and puts her faith 
   in Lucifer (The gypsy witch pronounces her the &quot;Princess of the 
   Old One&quot;). When members of the flock demand proof that Susan is 
   telling the truth, Susan transforms into a miniature version of 
   Mother Gaut&egrave;re (complete with thinning, white stringy hair and 
   rotten teeth), pulls out the kidnapped baby, plunges a dagger into 
   the child and fills the stolen chalice with the baby's blood, which 
   members of the flock take turns drinking. Suddenly, lighting strikes 
   and it starts to rain, so the flock scatters, as we watch the 
   possessed Susan chowing-down on the baby's dismembered arm! The next 
   morning, the Barnes family maid, Helen (billed here as &quot;La 
   Pocha&quot;, but is actually actress Julia Saly; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightOfThe Werewolf">NIGHT
    OF THE WEREWOLF</A></B> - 1980), delivers a tray of breakfast to 
   Susan in her bedroom and when Susan knocks the tray from Helen's 
   hands and yells &quot;Bullshit!&quot;, she is admonished by Anne, so 
   Susan says to her, &quot;Why don't you suck your boyfriend and leave 
   me alone!&quot; (Kids say the darndest things, don't they?). Anne 
   reports Susan's behavior to her father and at the same time, a bunch 
   of schoolchildren discover the mutilated corpse of the missing baby. 
   When Susan sees Father Juan in the park, she bluntly asks him if he 
   has a girlfriend and does he have sex with her. When Father Juan (who 
   looks puzzled that a girl so young would ask him such a question) 
   replies that men of the cloth have to resist such urges, Susan says, 
   &quot;Either you're a goddamn queer or impotent!&quot; and runs away 
   (Kids, you gotta love 'em!). Father Juan has a flashback when he was 
   younger and was in love with a beautiful girl named Esther (Maria 
   Kosty; <B><A HREF="exorcism_1975.htm">EXORCISM</A></B> - 1975; 
   another Spanish demonic possession film). He tells her that he can no 
   longer see her romantically because he has decided to become a priest 
   and walks away, leaving her crying, something he still regrets to 
   this day. He decides to search for Esther to see how she is doing. 
   Meanwhile, the entire town is in turmoil, because it is obvious that 
   the mutilated baby was killed after Mother Gaut&egrave;re died, but 
   they decide to dig up her body, douse it with gasoline and set it on 
   fire. What they didn't expect was that the dead body of Mother 
   Gaut&egrave;re would scream as it burns into ashes. Even more 
   surprised is the Barnes household, as they watch Susan slithering on 
   the floor like a snake and moving objects (like closing a door) with 
   just a wave of her hand. Mr. Barnes calls in a doctor (Fernando 
   Hilbeck; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Let Sleeping Corpse">LET 
   SLEEPING CORPSES LIE</A></B> - 1974), who tells Mr. Barnes that Susan 
   spoke to him in several languages, a few of them he never heard 
   before (Mr. Barnes is shocked, as he tells the doctor, &quot;Susan 
   couldn't even memorize a few French words when we brought in a 
   tutor!&quot;). The doctor ends up strapping Susan to a table and 
   sedating her, as he calls in Father Juan for some possible help. Even 
   though the doctor doesn't believe in the rites of exorcism, he wants 
   to keep the good Father handy in case his scientific methods don't 
   work. Helen finds the evil idol in the teddy bear (all the furniture 
   in the room moves when she picks it up) and she gives it to Anne, who 
   in turn gives it to William to do some research on since he is a 
   reporter. Father Juan finally locates Esther, only to discover that 
   she has turned into an alcoholic whore. Esther blames Juan for what 
   she has become (Jesus, can it get any worse? Why yes, it can!). 
   William tells Mr. Barnes to have his police force keep watch on the 
   house because he feels that someone may be out to kidnap Susan (Boy, 
   has he got it wrong!), while Susan, who now speaks in Mother 
   Gaut&egrave;re's voice, nearly breaks Anne's wrist when she tries to 
   remove the necklace from her neck. Susan then calls William on the 
   phone using Anne's voice and asks him to meet her in the park, while 
   the real Anne goes to the church to ask Father Juan to perform an 
   exorcism, which he will only agree to do when all scientific methods 
   fail and he gets permission from his superiors. Susan, who has once 
   again transformed into a miniature Mother Gaut&egrave;re, 
   spider-walks upside down the outside wall of the Barnes' household 
   and strangles a policeman who is keeping watch on the house. In the 
   film's most WTF?!? scene, Susan kills William in the park and then 
   cuts off his balls (!), taking them with her and putting them in a 
   small giftwrapped box with a nice bow on top. Once William's 
   mutilated body is found, Father Juan believes an exorcism is in 
   order, but the Police Chief has a recording of Anne calling William 
   (not knowing it was actually Susan) and brings Anne into the police 
   station, accusing her of murdering her fianc&eacute;. Susan shows up 
   at the police station and gives Anne the giftwrapped box and when 
   Anne opens it and discovers William's testicles and screams, everyone 
   now believes an exorcism is in order. Father Juan learns that Esther 
   committed suicide, leaving a note addressed to him blaming him for 
   her taking her own life (which is a cardinal sin). Will Father Juan 
   be able to perform an exorcism since he may have lost his faith? 
   Susan steals a baby for sacrifice, so Mr. Barnes, Father Juan, Anne 
   and the entire police force try to stop Susan, the gypsy witch and 
   her flock from sacrificing the baby for their <A HREF="possessed_aka_demon_witch_child_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/possessed aka demon witch child vhs front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>Dark
    Lord. The Police Chief shoots and kills the gypsy witch as her flock 
   scatters, but Susan escapes with the baby into a graveyard. Father 
   Juan is knocked off his feet by Susan's powers, but when she comes in 
   close for the kill, Father Juan presses his crucifix on her forehead, 
   which burns the sign of the cross into her skin. Father Juan performs 
   an impromptu exorcism, where Susan tries every trick in the book to 
   defeat him (even speaking in Esther's voice), but the exorcism works 
   and Susan is finally free. Unfortunately, one of the sharp stones in 
   her necklace has impaled her heart and she dies in her father's arms. 
   Oh, well. Win some, lose some.&nbsp; Believe me when I say there is 
   never a dull moment in this film. Director/writer Amando De Ossorio, 
   who also made <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#FangsLivingDead1969">FANGS

    fills this flick with unbelievable dialogue (the things that come 
   out of Susan's mouth are priceless) and some bad-taste violence. 
   While there isn't much gore and most of the violence is off-screen, 
   De Ossorio films it in such a way that still makes you wince. One you 
   see Susan eating a baby's arm, you will never forget it (it is filmed 
   in a long shot, so you will have to freeze-frame the scene and really 
   take a look) and, while we don't see Susan cut off William's 
   testicles, it is filmed in such a way that still makes us feel 
   uncomfortable. We watch Susan bent over William, who is lying on the 
   ground, and see her slice &quot;something&quot; over and over between 
   his legs and then wrap it in a hankerchief, so just watching a child 
   castrate a man is creepy all on its own. De Ossorio (who passed away 
   in 2001), went on record to say that he hired Mari&aacute;n Salgado 
   to portray Susan just because she supplied Linda Blair's voice in the 
   Spanish-dubbed version of the film which was the inspiration for this 
   movie, which is also known as <B><A HREF="possessed_aka_demon_witch_child_1974.htm">THE
    POSSESSED</A></B>, and she does a good job here portraying a 
   possessed young teen who says some things that really make you laugh 
   and cringe at the same time. It is apparent that the people 
   responsible for the English dubbing were having a good time recording 
   the dialogue for this film, as many of the lines are read in such an 
   overwrought manner (especially the woman who dubbed the young gypsy 
   witch), that you will have fun with the entire film (One totally 
   hilarious scene has Father Juan conducting a children's choir, where 
   all they do is sing, &quot;Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na&quot; over 
   and over!). This is one of the better demonic possession films of the 
   70's (sometimes for all the wrong reasons) and is a good addition to 
   your library. Originally released on fullscreen VHS (as <B><A HREF="possessed_aka_demon_witch_child_1974.htm">THE

   viewing these types of films in grindhouses during the 70's. If you

    FETUS</A><A NAME="DevilFetus"></A> (1983) -</B> In this wild and 
   crazy Hong Kong horror film, a woman named Shu Ching buys a strange 
   jade vase at an auction (it looks like a small demon straddling a 
   giant penis), brings it home, places it next to her bed and, that 
   night, she begins fondling it like a sex toy and starts getting 
   horny. Before she knows it, the vase has turned into a slimy, 
   worm-infested demon,<A HREF="devil_fetus_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/devil fetus dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   who fucks her brains out. When her husband comes home from a 
   six-month business trip and finds Shu Ching using the vase as a 
   dildo, he smashes it into tiny pieces, only to have his face become a 
   maggot-infested decaying piece of flesh. When he looks in the mirror 
   and sees what he has become, he kills himself by jumping through the 
   bedroom window. It's not long before Shu Ching discovers she is 
   pregnant (&quot;I feel disgusting!&quot;), which is not good 
   considering her husband's time away from home. Her husband comes back 
   from the dead to haunt her and, after turning into a black cat (!), 
   he kills Shu Ching by knocking her off a staircase. End of story, 
   right? Not by a long shot. A priest has a vision of a monster baby 
   bursting out of Shu Ching's corpse during her funeral, so he tells 
   her family (including her mother, a sister and her husband and two 
   bratty nephews) that Shu Ching and her husband are wandering spirits, 
   but he is able to stop their wandering by placing magical protective 
   parchments in their bedroom and tells them that if the parchments 
   aren't disturbed for twelve years, they will rest in peace for 
   eternity. Fat chance that is going to happen. Nearly twelve years 
   pass and one of the nephews, Kent Chong (Eddie Chan), has returned 
   home after after winning one of his many sword-fighting competitions 
   (he's very handy with a rapier). Kent falls in love with a young 
   woman named Juju (Shirley Lui), who is staying with the Chong family. 
   Juju accidentally touches the protective parchments in the bedroom, 
   the parchments burst into flames and the Chong's guard dog, Boby, 
   ingests the ashes of one of the parchments. Boby attacks Kent and 
   Juju, forcing Kent to kill Boby with a sword (Kent's mom blames the 
   attack on her husband, saying that he always fed the dog chili!). Now 
   things really get strange. Kent's brother, Wei, is possessed when he 
   buries Boby in the back yard, later digging up the dog and eating its 
   corpse! While driving home one night, Ma and Pa Chong think they have 
   hit a woman who looks exactly like Shu Ching, but when they get out 
   of the car, no one is there. When they get home and <A HREF="devil_fetus_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/devil fetus dvd front2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="232" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>park
    the car, it suddenly has a mind of it's own and runs over the 
   Chong's butler. A possessed Wei tries to drown Juju in the family 
   pool and then rapes and strangles the family maid. Only Granny Chong 
   (Ouyang Sha-Fei) seems to understand the gravity of the situation and 
   hires an elderly white-haired priest to fight the evil. What happens 
   next is better left for the viewer to discover, as describing it in a 
   review would simply not do it justice. Needless to say, there's 
   plenty of mind-warping sights on view and a few &quot;What The 
   Fuck?!?&quot; moments that will leave your head spinning (if not 
   detaching from your body and flying through the air).&nbsp; Like most 
   Hong Kong supernatural and horror-themed films of the 70's &amp; 
   80's, <B><A HREF="devil_fetus_1983c.htm">DEVIL FETUS</A></B> doesn't 
   make much sense, but, by god, it is never boring. I'm sure a lot of 
   the plot is lost to cultural differences and bad translation (the 
   English subtitles are hilarious), but the film is a delirious mix of 
   horror and martial arts genres. There's cannibalism (and dog-eating); 
   a gooey death by crushing when the walls of a sauna close-in on Pa 
   Chong (Ho Pak-Kwong); an arm reaching out of the grave and stretching 
   like rubber to grab a frightened old priest; plenty of wire work; 
   cheap opticals where Wei shoots laser beams out of his eyes; lots of 
   reverse and stop-motion photography; worm-puking (a Hong Kong 
   staple); and even a few scenes of nudity. Director Lau Hung Chuen (<B><A HREF="chinese_legend_1991.htm">A
    CHINESE LEGEND</A></B> - 1991) keeps everything moving at a brisk 
   pace, even when you're not sure what the hell is going on. My only 
   complaint is that the version I saw, which was sourced from the 
   fullscreen Ocean Shores VHS tape, cuts off the subtitles on both the 
   left and right sides of the screen and seems to edit out much of the 
   dog-eating scene and nudity, especially Wei's rape of the maid. Those 
   are small complaints considering what is still left on view (You want 
   flying heads? The finale has more than it's fair share.). Also

   opens in China 200 B.C., where a bunch of monks lower a wooden crate 
   into a large hole after attaching a large gem amulet on the top of 
   the crate. It is obvious that the amulet was put there to keep 
   whatever is in the crate from escaping. The leader of the monks then 
   kills all the monks and slits his own throat so no one can ever tell 
   where the crate was hidden. Cut to the present in New York City, 
   where martial arts teacher Luke (Warhawk Tanzania, here billed as 
   &quot;War Hawk Tanzania&quot;; <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#ForceFour1974">FORCE
    FOUR</A></B> - 1974, his only other film) is teaching police 
   detective Cris (Larry Fleishman) the finer points of kung-fu while 
   beating the snot out of him (Luke, who doesn't care for the police, 
   was once saved by Cris from certain death, so he feels he owes him), 
   when they are interrupted by Luke's student/best friend Rodan 
   (Wilfredo Roldan, in a performance that has to be seen to be 
   believed). Rodan tells Luke that there will soon be a war between the 
   black gangs and the Chinese gangs because of what he did to one 
   Chinese guy at a card game earlier that day. Luke is happy that he 
   and Rodan are taking a trip to China (by way of Hong Kong) that night 
   to brush-up on their kung-fu skills with a Chinese grandmaster. When 
   they get to China (actually the Brooklyn Botanical Garden!), Luke is 
   being taught the finer arts of martial arts by the Master, while 
   Rodan finds the giant hole and removes the gem amulet (which he nows 
   wears as a necklace!) and they both head home to New York City. 
   Meanwhile, a demon breaks out of the crate and takes over a Chinese 
   businessman (played by Aki Aleong, a popular Asian actor who has 
   appeared in hundreds of films and is still going strong today) and 
   the possessed businessman takes a slow boat from China to New York 
   City (How do we know the businessman is possessed? Why he has his 
   eyelids painted like ping pong balls! The clearness of the DVD 
   affords us to see it.) When the demon businessman makes it to New 
   York City, he finds that he/it cannot stand the light (never mind 
   that everyone on the street doesn't give a damn that he looks like a 
   monster!), so he heads for the nearest subway and hides out in the 
   tunnels. He sheds his businessman skin (the film's most effective 
   scene) and is now a full-fledged demon.&nbsp; Rodan and a friend make 
   a deal with a cocaine dealer for a brick of cocaine, but they are 
   then ripped off by members of a Chinese gang in retaliation for what 
   Rodan did at the card game. The demon then kills his first victim (a 
   businessman who misses his subway train, portrayed by late <B><A HREF="i_drink_your_blood_1971_dvd2.htm">I
    DRINK YOUR BLOOD</A></B> [1971] director David E. Durston, who hears 
   a young girl cry &quot;Help me!&quot; in the tunnel and goes to 
   investigate) and Cris and his new partner Sam (Stephen &quot;Sam&quot;
    DeFazio), who is really wet behind the ears, look at the mangled 
   body, while a cop pukes and a priest (portrayed by Brother Theodore, 
   but more on him later) gives the body the Last Rites. Sam offers a 
   theory so out there that no one could take it seriously: When the 
   subway tunnels were first created, it released a bunch of mutated 
   dogs and cats, who probably still roam the tunnels today. 
   Unfortunately for Cris, a newspaper reporter is at the scene and 
   hears Sam's theory and it makes front page news the next day (which 
   pisses off Cris and Sam's boss). As more and more people are being 
   slaughtered in the tunnels (including a rapist who is about to 
   sexually assault a woman) and Rodan continues his war against the 
   Chinese gangs (he steps on one gang member's neck until he spits out 
   that bright red blood that was so popular in 70's films), Cris and 
   Sam are flummoxed as to what can be causing these deaths (Cris 
   actually begins to believe Sam's idiotic theory!). When Rodan is 
   killed by the demon, Luke blames the Chinese gang, so he goes on a 
   one-man war against the Chinese (in a gold lam&eacute; jumpsuit!), 
   until the leader of the gang convinces Luke that their gang was not 
   responsible for Rodan's death. He takes Luke to an old Chinese wise 
   man (in makeup so bad, you can actually see the crease marks, 
   something you could never see in the VHS versions), who tells Luke 
   that the demon is after the gem amulet (Luke now has it in his 
   possession). If the demon gets its hands on the amulet and destroys 
   it, he/it will become immortal and nothing will ever be able to stop 
   it. Luke does the only natural thing that a sane person would do: He 
   goes down into the subway tunnels and challenges the demon to a 
   fight, but the demon does not fight fair, first appearing as Luke's 
   girlfriend (Elsie Roman), then splitting into two separate twin 
   fighters and then turning invisible, hitting Luke with invisible 
   punches and kicks. Luke finally gets the upper hand and destroys the 
   demon (thanks to the amulet) and then gives it to the old Chinese 
   wise man, who takes a slow boat to China to return it to its natural 
   place. At the hospital, Cris, Luke's girlfriend and Sam congratulate 
   Luke on a job well done and Sam makes an old reference to a 40's song 
   and the film ends!&nbsp; While this has some of the worse martial 
   arts fights ever committed to film (you can clearly see about 75% of 
   the punches and kicks thrown miss their targets by a country mile), 
   this is just such a weird film, you cannot help but like it. Director 
   Barry Rosen only directed one other film, <B><A HREF="yum_yum_girls_1976.htm">YUM
    YUM GIRLS</A></B> in 1976, but he has been working in other 
   capacities on films and television, including Line Producer on the 
   cult item <B><A HREF="highway_to_hell_1991.htm">HIGHWAY TO HELL</A></B>

   cameo (he improvised all his lines) as a priest who hangs out at 
   subway entrances, but he still manages to give one of my favorite 
   quotes of his when he warns people not to go into the subway: <A HREF="gang_wars_1975.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/gang wars vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="131" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A><B>&#147;</B>All
    the great spiritual leaders are dead ... Moses is dead ... Muhammed 
   is dead ... Buddha is dead ... and I&#146;m not feeling so hot 
   myself!&#148; Brother Theodore (rest his soul) was such an expert at 
   absurdist intellectual humor that he was a favorite guest on the 
   late, lamented David Letterman Show for years (look for his 
   appearances on YouTube) and always had me howling with laughter in my 
   seat while his type of humor went over most of the audiences' heads 
   (but not Letterman's). Theodore had a one-man show on Off-Broadway 
   for years and I went to see him a couple of times. He never 
   disappointed and I would always leave the show with a splitting 
   headache from laughing so hard. The rest of the actors in the film 
   are what we call &quot;semi-professionals&quot; although the bag lady 
   (Sylvia Mann) who roams the subway cars yelling out antedotes about 
   the passengers is a hoot (she was also the mother of this film's 
   cinematographer, Paul Glickman; <B><A HREF="god_told_me_to_1976.htm">GOD
    TOLD ME TO</A></B> - 1976). The standout is Wilfredo Roldan (<B><A HREF="action.htm#Velvet Smooth">VELVET
    SMOOTH</A></B> - 1975, which also co-stars this film's Moses Illiya 
   and Elsie Roman) as Rodan, who shouts out every line he is given and 
   becomes unintentionally comical in a good way. When he is killed, the 
   film loses some of its charm (luckily it is late in the film). The 
   demon makeup (by Lowell Patton and David Wood) is pretty good for 
   such a low-budget affair (it was filmed in two and a half weeks) and 
   you can see it much more clearly in this DVD presentation than in any 
   version of the VHS you may have (and it's 1.78:1 Widescreen 
   Anamorphic, to boot). It took five people (including Rosen) to write 
   the screenplay to this mess of a film, but as a cult item, you could 
   do a lot, lot worse (Besides, it gives you a nolstalgic feeling on 
   how the streets and subways [which was 50&#162; at the time!] of NYC 
   looked back in the 70's). The blood and gore may be sparse, but when 
   it does show up, it is effective. The Code Red DVD offers both 
   trailers for the film. The trailer for <B><A HREF="devils_express_1975c.htm">DEVIL'S
    EXPRESS</A></B> plays up the supernatural angle, while the one for <B><A HREF="gang_wars_1975b.htm">GANG
    WARS</A></B> totally omits any mention of a demon in the subway and 
   was definitely made to appeal to martial arts fans (a lot of people 
   seem to think these are two different cuts of the film, but they are 
   wrong). This is one film where I can honestly say to throw away all 
   those crappy VHS tapes and try to find the Code Red DVD version (like 
   all things Code Red, it may be hard to find). This is an entertaining

    In the 1920's, a movie crew is filming in a castle when they 
   discover a sealed-up crypt of a vampire. The director tells his 
   cameraman not to stop shooting (on an old hand-cranked movie camera), 
   as he and two crewmembers enter the crypt and break the seal on the 
   vampire's tomb, who is nothing but a skeleton. Of course, one of the 
   crewmembers cuts his hand when opening the tomb and drips blood on 
   the skeleton, causing it to quickly take human form (stop-motion 
   animation supplied by effects pro Sergio Stivaletti; <B><A HREF="wax_mask_1997.htm">WAX
    MASK</A></B> - 1997). The vampire rises from his tomb (the director 
   says, &quot;Keep shooting! Keep on shooting! We don't want to miss a 
   thing!&quot;) and kills all of the movie crew, beginning with the 
   cameraman. Fast-forward to the present, where the vampire, Jurek 
   (George Hilton; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#AllColorsDark1972">ALL
    THE COLORS OF THE DARK</A></B> - 1972), is a famous director of 
   horror films, getting the blood he needs to survive by holding 
   auditions for his films and inviting the winning actors back to his 
   castle for dinner and rehearsal, where he puts the bite on them. We 
   are then at the most recent audition, where a group of aspiring 
   actors (Jurek only uses novice actors for his films so they won't be 
   missed) wait in the rain for their turn to audition. When to door 
   finally opens, everyone comes in and does their best auditions. It 
   should be noted that Jurek is not at the auditions. He depends on the 
   advice of his right hand man Matteo (Stefano Sabelli; <B><A HREF="mean_tricks_1992.htm">MEAN
    TRICKS</A></B> - 1992; Umberto Lenzi's final film as director), who 
   sends his boss the tapes of the best auditions. The winners of this 
   audition are singer Rita (Patrizia Pellegrino; <B><A HREF="final_justice_1984.htm">FINAL
    JUSTICE</A></B> - 1984), dancer Monica (Yvonne Scio; <B><A HREF="redline_1997.htm">REDLINE</A></B> 
   - 1997), actress Sasha (Valeria Milillo<B>; <A HREF="alta_tensione_1988-1990.htm">SCHOOL
    OF FEAR</A></B> - 1989) and wiseass actor Gianni (Riccardo Rossi), 
   all of them getting a phone call to join Jurek at his castle. They 
   all get picked up in a Bentley limo and have no idea where they are 
   going, as the unseen driver refuses to answer any of their questions. 
   When they arrive at the castle and knock on the door, they are 
   greeted by hunchbacked servant Gilles (Daniele Aldrovandi; doing his 
   best Marty Feldman impersonation; Gianni even calls him Feldman in 
   the film), as they watch two men exiting the castle carrying 
   something (or someone) wrapped in a rug. A strange woman in a black 
   veil and carrying a hairless cat drops a single rose from the balcony 
   that lands at Rita's feet. What does that mean? Hell if I know!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Matteo
    then greets them and says that Jurek will be unable to meet them 
   until dinner at midnight, telling them to make themselves 
   comfortable. The castle is a marvel of ancient architecture, with 
   huge white rooms with cathedral ceiling and hidden passageways in 
   nearly every room. Those passageways will be used a lot in this film. 
   Gianni asks everyone who exactly is Jurek and what is his claim to 
   fame, as he has never heard of him before (Then what the fuck was he 
   doing at the audition?!?). Monica says that Jurek is a great director 
   of horror films and she can't wait to meet him at dinner at midnight. 
   Wiseass Gianni (who can't complete a sentence without making a joke) 
   asks, &quot;Why midnight? Is he a vampire?&quot; Gianni doesn't know 
   how right he is or the strange reason why Jurek invited them to his 
   castle. This won't be the same old, same old for Jurek, as he has a 
   different outcome in mind and he hopes these four aspiring actors are 
   up to the task.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The strange woman suddenly appears, clothed in an 18th Century dress 
   and tells Gianni that this is a castle of horrors, but she disappears 
   as fast as she appeared, not elaborating on her statement. Sasha 
   looks for the bathroom and when she finds it, she sees the face of a 
   female monster in a mirror and runs away, ending up in a room full of 
   antique clothing and a table full of human body parts. She screams 
   and Matteo appears, telling her not to be afraid, this room is full 
   of props for Jurek's next movie. Before dinner, everyone is made to 
   watch one of Jurek's favorite films he directed, a creepy black &amp; 
   white flick about a young woman named Nadia (Letizia Ziaco) playing a 
   game of Hide &amp; Seek with her lover in a castle, when a vampire 
   strikes. It is obvious the vampire is actually Jurek in his monstrous 
   vampire form and this film was shot in the 1920's when his tomb was 
   opened, but why does Jurek insist everyone watch this film? The group 
   watches as Jurek rips out the lover's heart with his bare hands. 
   While they watch as Jurek puts the bite on Nadia, the strange woman 
   appears and makes a pass at Gianni. It is at this time we realize 
   that the strange woman and Nadia are the same person, but why does 
   Rita pass out while watching the film? Matteo carries Rita up to her 
   room, where Nadia pays a visit and tries to bite Rita on the neck, 
   but she wakes up and goes downstairs to join her new friends who are 
   watching the rest of the movie, but the film gets stuck in the 
   projector and cannot proceed (Nadia tells Matteo that Jurek will be 
   mad that they didn't watch the entire film, but Matteo says not to 
   tell Jurek what has happened). Rita can't find them and gets locked 
   in the castle's cellar, ending up in the crypt the 1920's film crew 
   found. Just when it looks like curtains for Rita, Gilles appears and 
   takes her back to her friends.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When midnight arrives, Matteo introduces the guests to Jurek. At the 
   late dinner, Jurek makes a toast to &quot;the night that lies 
   ahead.&quot; Gianni notices that Jurek doesn't cast a reflection in 
   the mirror and Jurek says that's because he is a vampire (yet, later 
   in the film, we can see clearly Jurek's reflection in a mirror as he 
   opens a door, one of the film's very lazy mistakes, but more on that 
   later). Jurek tells the scared foursome that he has been a vampire 
   for four thousand years, but he is becoming bored living the life of 
   a vampire. Jurek wants the four of them to put an end to this 
   &quot;non-life&quot; of his, giving them until dawn to kill him, 
   otherwise he will drink their blood and turn them into horrible 
   undead monsters. Jurek is incapable of taking his own live because 
   vampires are unable to kill themselves. He also tells them that the 
   castle is inescapable until dawn; so don't try leaving because it is 
   hopeless. After Jurek turns into a bat (offscreen) and flies away, 
   Matteo takes them to a cell containing Jurek's other victims; hideous 
   monsters who survive on scraps of red meat that Matteo and Gilles 
   feed them. He tells the foursome if they don't want to end up in this 
   cell, they better kill Jurek (Matteo hopes they succeed because he is 
   becoming tired of doing all of Jurek's bidding). Matteo tells them 
   that the film they just watched holds the key to Jurek's death, but 
   they didn't see the entire film because it became stuck in the 
   projector. The group tries everything to kill Jurek, such as 
   threatening him with a homemade crucifix (made out of chair legs), 
   garlic and even a wooden stake to his heart, but Jurek says don't 
   believe everything you see in vampire movies because it is untrue (He 
   pulls the large stake out of his body and is no worse for wear. He 
   even shows the group that he wears a gold crucifix around his neck!). 
   When Jurek senses Matteo's treachery, with a wave of his hand 
   Matteo's heart comes bursting out of his chest and flying into 
   Jurek's hand! Will anyone survive the night or is it hopeless? Will 
   watching the rest of the film give them a way to kill Jurek or is the 
   actual film akin to the portrait of Dorian Gray? Will destroying the 
   film negative put an end to Jurek? Watch the film yourself to find 
   out. No? Okay, here's what happens: Jurek accidentally sets himself 
   on fire and his body burns and melts away (more stop-motion 
   animation). Everyone runs outside at dawn and the Bentley limo shows 
   up, driven by...Jurek! The foursome refuse a ride back to 
   civilization and run away, followed by Gilles, who tells them to slow 
   down, he can't run that fast. <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">THE END</FONT></B>.

    This is better acted than most of Lamberto Bava's other TV movies, 
   as George Hilton (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#StrangeViceWardh71">THE
    STRANGE VICE OF MRS. WARDH</A></B> - 1971) looks like he is having a 
   ball. I could have done without a lot of Gianni's wisecracks and it 
   could have used some bloody violence (although Sergio Stivaletti does 
   supply three stop-motion moments in the film, including the two I 
   already mentioned and Jurek's hand turning into a long-nailed 
   monstrosity, all done with old school charm) and some female nudity, 
   but this film manages to hold up for 91 minutes. That's not to say 
   there aren't some major problems with the film, because the 
   screenplay, written by Bava and Dardano Sacchetti (Bava's <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#BladeInDark1983">A
    BLADE IN THE DARK</A></B> - 1983), based on a story by Luciano 
   Martino (Bava's <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#DeliriumGioia1987">DELIRIUM:
    PHOTO OF GIOIA</A></B> - 1987), is full of plot holes and mistakes, 
   including Jurek casting a reflection in a mirror only a few scant 
   minutes after saying he doesn't. I know this is a TV movie and they 
   are usually shot very fast, unlike theatrical features, but a major 
   mistake like this, with the camera focused on a mirror and showing 
   Jurek opening a door, is just sloppy filmmaking. Still, it's a fun 
   little film if you leave your brain at the door. It is full of little 
   comic moments, such as when Gianni shoves a VHS tape in Jurek's mouth 
   and his fangs get caught in the plastic case. The title of the movie 
   on the VHS?: &quot;Per Favore Non Mordermi Sul Collo&quot;, which 
   translates to &quot;Please Don't Bite Me On The Neck&quot;! Most of 
   these TV movies are insufferable, but I found myself enjoying this 
   film somewhat if only for Hilton's performance. I'm happy to say 
   Hilton and nearly everyone else in this film are still around and 
   acting in Italian TV and cinema, so if you have nothing better to do, 
   this film should make you a little happy. A little happiness is 
   better than no happiness at all, right? This is not a recommendation, 
   just an observance.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   leave a lot to be desired, I have found his films to be highly

   First of all, Rudy makes an unlikely action hero. With his spandex 
   jumpsuits and paunched-out stomach, he reminds me of that strange 
   Uncle that everyone in your family talks about over Thanksgiving 
   dinner. Definitely not action hero material. The scenes of people 
   tripping out on Angel Dust must be seen to be believed. Bucky 
   hallucinates that his hand is chopped off by a witch with a sword. 
   Cartoon blood pours out of his wounds when he also imagines that he 
   is being shot by three Brothers with big guns. This is really wild 
   stuff. The action scenes are also unbelievable. Rudy has to be the 
   stiffest martial artist in the world. He looks like he is in deep

   a vampire, as her family kept her out of that culture her whole life 
   (it still doesn't explain how she was born!). Berta is married to 
   Hans (Tony Isbert; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#RingsOf Fear1978">RINGS 
   OF FEAR</A></B> - 1978), a handsome young man who doesn't suffer 
   fools gladly. Berta has been having nightmares where she is being 
   chased by a wolfman and the closer she gets to the castle, the more 
   vivid her nightmares are. The coach driver refuses to take the couple 
   to the castle at night, so they are forced to go forward on foot 
   (&quot;It feels like someone is dragging me down.&quot; says Berta. 
   Hans then finds that her dress is caught on a tree branch!), where 
   they find a nude young woman, with two puncture wounds on her neck, 
   lying in the woods. They take her to the village inn, where Mother 
   Petrescu (Mimi Mu&ntilde;oz) takes care of the unconscious woman (who 
   has a huge shit-eating grin on her face) and tells one of the 
   villages to go fetch Dr. Karl (Henry Gregor; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Dr. Jekyll Wolfman">DR.
    JEKYLL AND THE WOLFMAN</A></B> - 1971), the village physician. The 
   doctor arrives and treats the woman, telling the guests she is just 
   simply anemic and needs a good night's sleep, but Hans notices every 
   young woman in the village has the same two puncture wounds on their 
   necks, yet it doesn't worry him. Hans and Berta spend the night at 
   the inn, where Berta has a dream where she shakes hands with an old 
   woman and her head falls off! During the night, the unconscious woman 
   disappears and Mother Petrescu tells Hans not to tell Berta because 
   it will upset her (I'll bet it's not as upsetting as an old woman's 
   head falling off!), Stilla (Betsabe Ruiz; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#HouseInsaneWomen71">HOUSE
    OF INSANE WOMEN</A></B> - 1971), a young woman in the next room to 
   the couple, is paid a visit by a cloaked figure, so she rips open her 
   nightgown, exposing her breasts, and smiles, while the figure comes 
   closer. The next morning, Gabor (J.J. Paladino), a servant from 
   Castle Dracula, arrives at the inn to accompany the couple to the 
   castle, being their new coach driver. Berta asks him how her 
   grandfather is doing and Gabor replies that he is &quot;dying&quot; 
   to see her (This is not a comedy. I repeat, this is not a comedy!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As soon as they get to the castle, Berta wants to visit the grave of 
   her grandmother, so Gabor takes her there. She is shocked to discover 
   a gravemarker for her grandfather next to her grandmother's grave, 
   but Gabor tells her not to worry (Don't worry? Really?). Both Berta 
   and Hans find it strange that none of her family have come to greet 
   them (it is still daylight) and Gabor tells them that her family will 
   greet them later on at dinner. As they unpack, Berta hears a woman 
   crying, but Hans hears nothing (He must be deaf!). They then have 
   lunch alone, where Hans makes a remark about how the wine tastes 
   &quot;peculiar&quot; (Hey Hans, no &quot;wine&quot; is that red!!!). 
   All the doors in the castle are locked, so they can't even explore 
   the castle. Berta feels something is terribly wrong (No shit!) and 
   starts crying, telling Hans she wants to leave, but he tells her to 
   come to the dining hall, where they meet Count Dracula (Narciso 
   Iba&ntilde;ez Menta; <B><A HREF="i_hate_my_body_1974.htm">I HATE MY BODY</A></B> 
   - 1974), his new wife Munia (Helga Lin&eacute;; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LoreleysGrasp1973">THE
    LORELEY'S GRASP</A></B> - 1973) and all her cousins (all female), as 
   well as the old woman from Berta's dream, Mrs. Gastrop (Elsa Zabala; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CurseOfTheDevil1973">CURSE
    OF THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1973). Another servant, Gert (Javier de 
   Rivera; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Fury Of Wolfman">FURY OF THE WOLFMAN</A></B> 
   - 1970), serves all of them a glass of the peculiar-tasting wine at 
   dinner and they toast to Berta's pregnancy. They all watch as Berta 
   lifts the glass to her lips to take a drink, but they are bitterly 
   disappointed when she doesn't like how it tastes (she also complains 
   that the food is undercooked!). Berta runs out of the room and the 
   Count tells Hans that the new life in Berta's belly is the heir to 
   the Dracula bloodline. Her &quot;son&quot; will inherit all of the 
   lands Dracula.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    One of Berta's cousins, Xenia (Mar&iacute;a Kosty; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#DragonflyEachCorpse">A
    DRAGONFLY FOR EACH CORPSE</A></B> - 1973), seduces Hans, stripping 
   him naked and screwing him while the rest of the family 
   watches...smiling! Hans then disappears for most of the remainder of 
   the film. When Berta's clothing trunk finally arrives at Castle 
   Dracula, two of her cousins, Irina (Cristina Suriani; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Horror Rises Tomb">HORROR
    RISES FROM THE TOMB</A></B> - 1972) and Gitana (Ingrid Rabel; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hunchback Morgue">HUNCHBACK
    OF THE MORGUE</A></B> - 1973), rifle through it, steal some of the 
   clothes and try them on, attacking a fire-and-brimstone-talking 
   religious fanatic (Luis Ciges; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#HousePsychoticWomen">HOUSE
    OF PSYCHOTIC WOMEN</A></B> - 1973) in the woods (They both strip 
   naked, so they don't get their new clothes dirty, and jump on him!). 
   Berta begins to have trouble with her pregnancy (she is not due to 
   drop the kid for five months) and, once again, hears the woman 
   crying, only this time Berta asks the crying woman if she has seen 
   her husband! (I think a crying woman would have more important things 
   on her mind!) Berta escapes from the castle, finding some of her 
   clothes in the woods and walking to the inn (!). She tells Mother 
   Petrescu and Dr. Karl that she just saw some gypsies in the woods and 
   the villagers take up arms because, you know, gypsies mean that 
   werewolves and ritualistic killings are not far behind. The religious 
   fanatic then enters the inn, his body bloody and broken, only giving 
   the villagers more of an impetus to kill the gypsies!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    For some unknown reason, Dr. Karl brings Berta back to the castle, 
   where she sees that Hans is white as a sheet, yet he bears a 
   shit-eating grin on his face (We later see the cousins using him as a 
   sex toy!). Berta sits at the dinner table, where all her cousins show 
   her their fangs, so she runs upstairs and tells Hans that they are 
   leaving.&nbsp; Instead of leaving, Hans tries to bite her, but fails. 
   We then see the Count whipping one of the cousins, telling Hans that 
   his bloodline has become impure by all the sexual funny business and 
   only Berta's newborn son will be able to make the family pure again. 
   That night, Hans tries to bite Berta again, but she is ready this 
   time, stabbing him to death with a butcher knife she has placed on 
   the bed (In a scene that makes absolutely no sense, we see Hans turn 
   old when he dies!). Will the Count's wishes come true or will Berta 
   perform the world's first coat hanger abortion?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The first thing you'll notice about this film is how horrendously 
   dubbed it is. The dubbing artists put zero emotion in their line readings<A HREF="dracula_saga_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dracula saga spain poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>,
    making their conversations sounding like they are reading newspapers 
   to each other. The second thing you'll notice is that this film makes 
   no sense at all, as all it seems to be is a series of unrelated 
   events strung together, with no connective tissue between the scenes. 
   I expected more from director Le&oacute;n Klimovsky, since I like 
   most of his other horror films. Besides the two I mentioned in the 
   beginning of this review, he was also responsible for <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Werewolf Shadow">WEREWOLF
    SHADOW</A></B>&nbsp; (1971), <B><A HREF="vengeance_of_the_zombies_1972.htm">VENGEANCE
    OF THE ZOMBIES</A></B>&nbsp; (1973), <B><A HREF="devils_possessed_1974.htm">DEVIL'S

    OF THE WALKING DEAD</A></B>&nbsp; (1975) and many others, before he 
   retired from directing in 1979 (and dying in 1996). The only thing I 
   can surmise about why this film turned out the way it did was because 
   something was lost in the translation from Spanish to English (it 
   wouldn't be the first time this has happened with a foreign horror 
   film), as the screenplay, by &quot;Lazarus Kaplan&quot; (actually 
   Emilio Mart&iacute;nez L&aacute;zaro; <B><A HREF="diary_of_an_erotic_murderess_1975.htm">DIARY
    OF AN EROTIC MURDERESS</A></B> - 1975), makes no sense in this 
   version, but it is absolutely hysterical for its unintentional humor. 
   There is plenty of female (and male) nudity, as well as some WTF?!? 
   scenes of unbelievability (Wait until you get a gander of <A HREF="dracula_saga_1973_mrs_gastrop_gif.htm">Mrs.
    Gastrop's head</A> towards the end of the film. It's the best moment 
   of the film, in my opinion.). It also contains some extremely graphic 
   scenes of violence (the Count's demise, as well as the deaths of 
   Berta's cousins, are memorable), but none of it could make up for the 
   film's total lack of coherence. What about Berta's baby? I'm afraid 
   that doesn't make a lick of sense either. A pregnant Berta dies in 
   the finale, yet the final shot is of a baby who has blood dripping in 
   his mouth (a scene which wouldn't be allowed in films today unless 
   the blood was CGI), as we hear the Count say, &quot;I live again! Ha! 
   Ha! Ha! Ha!...&quot; That makes about as much sense as tits on a rock.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The film opens with a sky view of New York City (the first image is 
   of the World Trade center) and then an on-screen scrawl announces, &quot;<B>This
    film is based on a true story as reported by journalist Jennifer O'Sullivan</B>&quot;
    (yeah, right!). We are then at a mental institution, where a nurse 
   comes staggering out of a room, her right breast bitten off by a 
   female patient (Cindy Leadbetter; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Rats">RATS:
    THE NIGHT OF TERROR</A></B> - 1983), who is a cannibal. Another 
   nurse tells the orderlies that this woman was found near the Amazon 
   rainforest and they slap a strait-jacket on the woman. 
   Journalist/nymphomaniac Emanuelle (Laura Gemser; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#EmanuellePrison1983">EMANUELLE
    IN PRISON</A></B> - 1983), who is undercover at this institution to 
   do a report on inmate abuse (the doctor who knows who she really is 
   is portrayed by director D'Amato, in a quick cameo), witnesses the 
   whole thing and takes photos of the cannibalism with a camera in a 
   doll's eyes (She carries the doll everywhere she goes. I guess dolls 
   are a sign of mental instability!). That night, Emanuelle sneaks into 
   the cannibal woman's room and rubs her hand over her vagina (!), 
   while she asks for her name. The woman doesn't answer, but Emanuelle 
   notices a strange tattoo over the woman's &quot;pubic region&quot; 
   (Emanuelle's words, not mine). Emanuelle shows her photos to her 
   editor and he believes the tattoo is an ancient Aztec symbol. From 
   the newspaper's archive records, Emanuelle discovers that the tattoo 
   is the symbol of the Topinambat, a tribe of ancient cannibals who are 
   thought to be extinct. If we know one thing about Italian cannibal 
   films, we know that the tribe is far from extinct. Before you can 
   say, &quot;Are you up for a trip?&quot;, Emanuelle is making plans of 
   traveling to the Amazon to find out exactly where the cannibal woman 
   was found. But first, she talks to world-famous anthropologist 
   Professor Mark Lester (frequent Gemser co-star Gabriele Tinti; <B><A HREF="violence_in_a_womens_prison_1982.htm">VIOLENCE
    IN A WOMEN'S PRISON</A></B> - 1982), who takes her back to his 
   apartment to show her some footage from his past expeditions, where 
   we see a cannibal tribe in Tanzania beheading a man and slicing off 
   the penis of another. They then eat the penis and also eat the eyes 
   from the decapitated head. (Before they get to his apartment, they 
   walk the streets of '70s New York City, which brought a nostalgic 
   rush over me, especially when I saw the Ed Sullivan Theater and the 
   American Museum of Natural History). They then make love in a graphic 
   display of softcore sex, before Mark agrees to go on the expedition 
   with her. Before she goes on her trip, Emanuelle makes love to 
   boyfriend Peter on the shore of the East River, with the Brooklyn 
   Bridge in the background. (Did I mention that Emanuelle is a nymphomaniac?)</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Once in the Amazon, they meet Mark's friend Wilkes (Geoffrey 
   Copleston; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackCat1981">THE BLACK CAT</A></B> 
   - 1981), who tells Emanuelle where they found the cannibal woman in 
   the nuthouse. They also meet Wilkes' daughter Isabelle (Monika 
   Zanchi; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#EyeBehindTheWall">THE EYE BEHIND THE WALL</A></B> 
   - 1977) and Sister Angela (Annamaria Clementi; <B><A HREF="porno_shop_on_7th_avenue_1979.htm">PORNO
    SHOP ON 7TH AVENUE</A></B> - 1979), both who will be going on the 
   expedition. Once again, Mark and Emanuelle make love, this time under 
   mosquito netting, as a jealous Isabelle secretly watches them and 
   masturbates (Again, quite graphic). Their first stop on the 
   expedition is a mission and their guides are Felipe and Manolo (Hal 
   Yamanouchi; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Endgame">ENDGAME</A></B> 
   - 1983). They take a boat, travel up river and stop at a waterfall, 
   where Emanuelle and Isabelle (along with a smoking champanzee!) make 
   naked lesbian love in a shallow lake (That Joe D'Amato, you gotta 
   love him!). After they are done, they travel further up river and 
   stop to set up camp. Emanuelle is attacked by a boa constrictor, when 
   stranger Donald McKenzie (Donald O'Brien; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DoctorButcher1980">DOCTOR
    BUTCHER M.D.</A></B> - 1980)&nbsp; appears and shoots the snake. 
   Donald tells them that the mission is no longer there and everyone is 
   dead, their bodies horribly mutilated. Donald is a big game hunter 
   and he has brought his wife Maggie (Susan Scott; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Slasher1972">THE
    SLASHER...IS THE SEX MANIAC!</A></B> - 1972) and guide Salvadore 
   (Percy Hogan; <B><A HREF="cosmos_war_of_the_planets_1977.htm">WAR OF 
   THE PLANETS</A></B> - 1977) along for the hunt. But is it big game 
   they are after? They all join in on Emanuelle's expedition, but it is 
   obvious that their camp is being watched. Time for some more sex: 
   Maggie masturbates while looking at Salvadore and then orders him to 
   follow her into the jungle, where they have hot, steamy sex. Donald 
   watches them doing it, but is he impotent (his wife thinks so)? It 
   turns out that Donald is a letch, as after watching his wife making 
   love to a black man, he then peeps on the naked Isabelle and Sister 
   Angela as they sleep (Does every female in this film sleep bare-assed?).
    The next morning they find Manolo's dead body, his torso slit open 
   from stem to stern and their boat is missing. Everyone travels on 
   foot through the jungle, where Sister Angela finds a Bible on the 
   ground. Isabelle finds a blanket and when she lifts it up, she 
   discovers the decapitated head of Father Morales, the head (so to 
   speak) of the mission. Donald and Maggie are searching for something, 
   but what could it be?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Isabelle falls into some quicksand and all the men save her just in 
   time. Donald feels-up Isabelle while she is sleeping (At least she is 
   wearing panties this time!) and when she wakes up and screams, Mark 
   comes to her rescue, but Donald beats him up (Maggie steps in and 
   stops him). Sister Angela disappears and everyone searches for her. 
   Felipe is killed by a spiked jungle booby trap and we then see that 
   Sister Angela has been captured by a tribe of cannibals. She is tied 
   to a tree, stripped naked and then has her right nipple cut off, 
   which one of the cannibals eats. She then has her chest graphically 
   ripped open and the tribe makes a meal out of her innards. Who will 
   be next and will anyone survive the slaughter? What are Donald and 
   Maggie looking for (Hint: It crashed in the jungle and contains 
   something sparkly)? Who will Emanuelle fuck next? Will it be a member 
   of the cannibal tribe? (Did I mention she is a nymphomaniac?). Will 
   decapitated heads on a stick ever be accepted in modern society? 
   That, and so much more, is waiting for you, so buy the damned Blu-Ray!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When it comes to sleazy entertainment, very few directors could 
   deliver it like Joe D'Amato. Packed with near-porn sex and nudity, as 
   well as graphic bloodletting, this film will have you watching in 
   amazement, as D'Amato fills the screen with a non-stop barrage of 
   sex, violence and some bat-shit crazy set pieces. The smoking 
   chimpanzee, which can not be found in South America, is one such set 
   piece. Where did he get a cigarette? And how did he light it?!? The 
   diamond sub-plot also comes out of left field and dig those cannibals 
   dancing around a captive Maggie!. Very few <A HREF="emmanuelle_and_the_last_cannibals_1977.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/emanuelle and the last cannibals italy poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>films

   sleazehound's dream come true (you haven't lived until you see a 
   woman's &quot;pubic region&quot; cut open and eaten by cannibals!). 
   The screenplay, by D'Amato and Romano Scandariato (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DeathSmilesMurder73">DEATH
    SMILES ON A MURDERER</A></B> - 1973; D'Amato's first film as a 
   director), tosses in as many human deaths as possible and the 
   highlight is the way Donald O'Brien is killed (I'll leave that for 
   you to discover). This is grindhouse at its best and, for once, there 
   are no real-life animal deaths on view. What more could you ask for? 
   Me? I'm more than satisfied.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Blasters/Shriek Show uncut and in widescreen. The <A HREF="http://www.severin-films.com">Severin
    Films</A> Blu-Ray is pleasing to the eye and has plenty of grain, 
   just the way I like my films (Not every film needs to have grain 
   digitally removed, making human skin look like it is made out of wax. 
   Grain is an important, natural part of filmmaking). D'Amato, who was 
   also the film's cinematographer, gives the film a healthy sheen, 
   making it hard to believe that the jungle scenes were actually filmed 
   just outside Rome (even though the film mistakenly [or on purpose] 
   lists it as being shot in and around &quot;Tapurucuara, Amazonas, 
   Brazil&quot;). There's no denying that Laura Gemser is a beautiful 
   woman and she has no inhibitions here, which is why she appeared as <A HREF="emanuelle_films_1973-1983.htm">Emanuelle

   English subtitles rarely match what is being said on screen (It is 
   available in Italian with English subtitles or English dubbed. I 
   watched the dubbed version with the subtitles turned on.), but that 
   is in no way a detriment, as it shows that the dubbers were having a 
   lot of fun with the dialogue. As always, the extras on the disc are 
   second-to-none, my favorite being the lengthy new interview with 
   Donald O'Brien, who talks (in Italian) about his career and the 
   people he worked with. He loved Burt Lancaster but didn't care too 
   much for Franco Nero, who he said always showed up drunk. His stories 
   are informative and funny. There are also interviews with actresses 
   Annamaria Clementi &amp; Monica Zanchi, as well as one with Nico 
   Fidenco, who supplied the catchy music to this film, as well as most 
   of the other Emanuelle films. There is also an audio interview with

   it for the retarded entertainment that it is. Consider it cotton 
   candy for your brain. Everyone needs to watch a film like this every 
   once in a while, if only to remind us what kind of films actually got 
   theatrical releases in the 70's. Like Gordon's previous year <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#FoodOfTheGods1976">FOOD
    OF THE GODS</A></B> (1976), this was also released on a <A HREF="empire_of_the_ants_1977_jaws_of_satan_1981_blu-ray.htm">double

    OF SATAN</A></B> (1981) as the co-feature. I'm still flabbergasted 
   how Mr. Gordon sets people like Joan Collins to appear in his films. 
   I would have loved to be in one of Bert I. Gordon's pitch meetings 
   listening to him talking Collins' agent into getting her to star in a 
   cheezy film about giant ants that want to take over mankind. It's not 
   like Joan Collins hasn't appeared in thrillers and horror films 
   before (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#TerrorUnderHouse">TERROR FROM 
   UNDER THE HOUSE</A></B> [1971], <B><A HREF="tales_from_the_crypt_1972.htm">TALES

    THAT WITNESS MADNESS</A></B> [1973] comes to mind), but they are all 
   higher-end productions when compared to this cheesefest. It only 
   makes me appreciate Joan Collins all the more as an actress who will 
   take any role that she pleases and she throws herself into this one. 
   After a brief history about ants (narrated by late voice master 
   supreme Marvin Miller, who was the voice of Robby The Robot in <B><A HREF="forbidden_planet_1956.htm">FORBIDDEN
    PLANET</A></B> [1956]), such as there are 15,000 different species 
   and the queen of the colony emits pheromones as a way to communicate 
   to her colony, giving each of them specific jobs to perform, we then 
   watch a ship dump barrels of radioactive waste into the ocean off the 
   coast of Florida. One of those drums washes ashore and starts leaking 
   (it looks like liquid mercury) on the beach of the proposed site of 
   Dreamland Shores, a pump and dump scheme run by crooked real estate 
   agent Marilyn Fryser (Collins) and her assistant/lover Charlie 
   (Edward Power). Marilyn hires boat captain Dan Stokely (Robert 
   Lansing; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Scalpel">SCALPEL</A></B> - 
   1976) to take a bunch of suck..., err prospective buyers, to 
   Dreamland Shores to buy parcels of land, all of which are no better 
   than swampland (they are very close to the Everglades). We then see a 
   colony of ants feeding on the radioactive waste from the leaking 
   barrel, which can only mean one thing: Big trouble. We then get to 
   know a little bit about each of the prospective buyers, such as 
   Charlie telling customer Joe (John David Carson; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Creature Black Lake">CREATURE
    FROM BLACK LAKE</A></B> - 1976) that one in three people go on these 
   excursions just for the free booze and food and he believes Joe is 
   one of those people (Charlie is right) or that the married Larry 
   (Robert Pine; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NoMansLandReeker">NO MAN'S 
   LAND: THE RISE OF REEKER</A></B> - 2008) ditches his wife Christine 
   (Brooke Palance; daughter of Jack Palance who had a very short acting 
   career) when they dock to try and get some action from Coreen (Pamela 
   Shoop; <B><A HREF="halloween_2_1981.htm">HALLOWEEN II</A></B> -

   the giant ants (reminicent of <B><A HREF="fly_1958.htm">THE FLY</A></B> 
   - 1958). Dan (Robert Lansing seems very disinterested in appearing in 
   this film) and fired long-time worker Margaret (Jacqueline Scott; <B><A HREF="charley_varrick_1973.htm">CHARLEY
    VARRICK</A></B> - 1973) have a heart-to-heart talk about whether she 
   should invest her life savings into a parcel of this land and Dan 
   tells her she should only buy here if they strike oil on it. Everyone 
   but Dan take a trolley car ride through the area, where Marilyn 
   starts her hard sell, where we see signs like &quot;Future Golf 
   Course&quot;, &quot;Future Marina&quot;, &quot;Future Tennis 
   Court&quot; and so on, but nothing has been built. All the 
   prospective buyers can see are pipes sticking out of the ground, the 
   signs and a picnic table under a tent midway through the tour, where 
   the customers can fill up on cheap booze and even cheaper sandwiches. 
   Thomas (Jack Kosslyn) and his wife Mary (Ilse Earl) sneak off and 
   Thomas discovers that the pipes (and a fire hydrant) are just buried 
   in the ground and not connected to anything. Before they can tell 
   anyone else of the deception, they are both attacked and killed by 
   giant ants (a mixture of Bert I. Gordon's plate photography and giant 
   ant puppets). Marilyn continues with the rest of the group one the 
   trolley ride and when she is told that Tom and Mary were left back at 
   the picnic area, Marilyn says they decided to stay back there. It's 
   only when everyone discovers the mangled corpse of one of Marilyn's 
   workers (all we see is his foot), do they realize that they stepped 
   into a big pile of shit. Coreen and Joe leave by foot to go find Tom 
   and Mary, while everyone else takes the trolley back to the dock. 
   When they get there, they see the dock is crawling with giant ants 
   and Dan is swimming to his boat to try and get it away from there. 
   When Dan gets to his boat, it is too late, as the ants are already 
   aboard and have killed his only crewman (if you look closely, you 
   will see more blood than what is allowed in films rated PG today). 
   Dan swings an axe at the ants and hits a gas can and decides to set 
   the boat on fire, making the discovery that the giants ants are 
   afraid of fire. Joe and Coreen have a couple of close calls with 
   giant ants after discovering Tom's body, but they make it back to the 
   dock, where Dan has built a giant campfire to keep the ants away. Of 
   course a torrential rainstorm hits the following morning, putting out 
   the fire, so Dan (minus Marilyn and Charlie, who decide to hide-out 
   in one of the only hastily-built sheds at the shore) leads the rest 
   of them through the swamp to a river, where there is a small boat 
   waiting that can take them to civilization. The ants begin to 
   pick-off the people one-by-one. Coward Larry lets wife Christine 
   become ant food when she trips and hurts her ankle (The ant puppets 
   are low-rent, but effective). Charlie dies next when he and Marilyn 
   open the shed to discover a giant ant in it. Marilyn runs to join Dan 
   and his group. Old couple Harry &amp; Velma Thompson (Harry Holcombe 
   &amp; Irene Tedrow) break from the group and hide in an old shed in 
   the swamp, while the rest of the group find the boat and head down 
   river to the nearest town. Harry and Velma open the shed believing 
   they are now safe, only to discover that they are surrounded by giant 
   ants. The boat comes to a fork in the river and a guilt-ridden Larry 
   screams that they should go left, which Dan does, but like every 
   decision that Larry has made, it is the wrong one, as the river is 
   blocked by some downed trees and they are forced to fight some ants 
   before turning the boat around and taking the right at the fork in 
   the river. A short distance down the river, the group is attacked by 
   an ant, which kills Larry (Yea, ant!) and dumps everyone overboard, 
   where they all swim to shore. It then becomes apparent to Dan that 
   the ants are herding them in a particular direction like cattle and 
   we soon find out why when the group makes it to civilization and meet 
   a creepy old couple (the old woman whispers something into Coreen's 
   ear) who call Sheriff Kincade (Albert Salmi; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Superstition1982">SUPERSTITION</A></B> 
   - 1982) to come and pick up the new visitors. They should have 
   realized something was wrong when the much-too-accomodating Sheriff 
   Kincade mentions the local sugar refinery (The old woman whispered to 
   Coreen, &quot;Whatever you do, don't let them take you to the sugar 
   refinery.&quot;) and Joe can't get an outside line to call a 
   government friend, even though they see the Mayor talking long 
   distance to a raw sugar company about an important delivery. Dan and 
   Joe go to rent a car, when they hear the screech, but it only turns 
   out to be a kid on a Big Wheel (it's also the only time Robert 
   Lansing smiles in the whole film). They are unable to rent a car when 
   the girl behind the counter won't give them one because they both 
   lost their wallets and have no identification or driver licenses. Dan 
   is highly suspicious of the whole town, so Joe hotwires a car and 
   they all take off to leave town, only to discover the road is blocked 
   by police cars. They are run off the road and crash into a small 
   pond, where they are captured and taken to the sugar refinery. We see 
   the Queen ant in a chamber spraying her pheromones on the townspeople 
   one-by-one (they have to be sprayed once a week because it wears 
   off), <A HREF="empire_of_the_ants_1977.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/empire of the ants dvd front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="209" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>so
    they will do her bidding: Make more refined sugar for her and her 
   colony. Sheriff Kincade moves the group to the top of the line, where 
   Marilyn is the first victim. After she is sprayed with the 
   pheromones, she exits the chamber a changed woman and tells the rest 
   of the group in a monotone voice that they will understand once they 
   get sprayed. Dan is next, but he is hiding a road flare in his pants 
   (I thought he was just happy to see me) and uses it to set the Queen 
   ant on fire. As the Queen burns, the people snap out of her spell and 
   the confused giant ants begin killing the sugar refinery workers. 
   They all run out of the refinery (except for Marilyn, who is killed 
   by the Queen while a revived Sheriff Kincade pumps some bullets into 
   the Queen's head) and Joe finds a gas tanker truck. He opens the 
   valve and drives the truck around the refinery while Dan and the rest 
   of the group find a motorboat on a dock. Joe jumps out of the truck 
   after he aims it at the opening of the refinery and the whole complex 
   catches on fire, burning all the ants to death. Joe joins Dan and the 
   group as they take off in the boat, navigating the Everglades' twisty 
   waterways, but is this the end to the menace? I hope so because I am 
   running low on Raid.&nbsp; While not as bloody as Gordon's 
   previously-mentioned PG-Rated <B><A HREF="food_of_the_gods_1976.htm">FOOD
    OF THE GODS</A></B>, this film does have its fair share (you just 
   have to look more closely and sometimes freeze the Blu-Ray to see it) 
   and has some pretty funny dialogue, such as when Coreen apologizes to 
   Joe by saying, &quot;Well, I don't know, I guess I just thought you 
   were one of those macho phony types, you know? The kind whose brains 
   fall out every time he unzips his fly.&quot; Gordon continued to use 
   the 50's way of showing giant ants walking on objects by having 
   normal-sized ants walking on glass with photos on small-sized objects 
   behind the glass to give the ants a giant look. The ant puppets are 
   thankfully used a lot because the plate photography sometimes bears 
   out mistakes, as the ants travel too far off the glass plates and 
   look like they are walking on air. The film takes a giant 180&#176; 
   turn during the final third of the film, which increases the 
   enjoyment much more than it should. I must have seen this film more 
   than 20 times, either on TV (Remember those days when films like this 
   were shown on the 4:30 Movie?), the <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Embassy">Embassy
    Home Entertainment</A> VHS or the widescreen MGM Midnite Movies DVD 
   (the Blu-Ray ports over Bert I. Gordon's running commentary from this 
   DVD but, at the time this review was written, Mr. B.I.G. was still 
   alive and in his mid-90's). The Blu-Ray, by <A HREF="http://www.shoutfactory.com">Shout!
    Factory</A> tentpole <A HREF="http://www.screamfactorydvd.com">Scream
    Factory</A> is in great shape, but the aspect ratio seems off a bit. 
   Words I remember seeing on the rental car building's window are cut 
   off (I'll have to check my DVD to see if it is there) and some of the 
   framing of certain scenes seem extremely tight, but that should in no 
   way deter you from buying this double-feature Blu-Ray, especially if 
   you are a Gordon fan (which I am). Also featuring Tom Fadden, Janie 
   Gavin, Norman Franklin, Florence McGee, Mike Armstrong, Tom Ford and 
   Jim Wheelus as Dan's unfortunate Crewman. A Scream Factory Blu-Ray

   those who have been reading the many reviews I have written in the 
   past 33 years (as of the time of this review), you know the last 
   thing I care about are the technical aspects. I'm all about the 
   movie, not the presentation. Maybe I'll give one or two lines about 
   how good or bad the film prints or VHS looks, but I mostly care about 
   the film itself. I have been searching for a copy of this film for 
   years, ever since I saw director/screenwriter Steve Barkett's crazy 
   post-apocalypse film <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Aftermath 1980">THE
    AFTERMATH</A></B> (1978) years and years ago on VHS, but finding a 
   VHS copy of <B>EMPIRE</B> (which, at the time of this writing, was 
   Barkett's only second time directing) was<A HREF="empire_of_the_dark_1991.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/empire of the dark vhs front3 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   about as hard as finding a VHS of <B><A HREF="films_on_the_fringe.htm#Black Devil Doll">BLACK
    DEVIL DOLL FROM HELL</A></B> (1984), so I struck out for over 
   twenty-five years. That is, until I received an email from VCI 
   Entertainment's website saying that they were offering both of 
   Barkett's films on DVD. I immediately jumped on the offers and 
   purchased both of them, only to discover that they were actually 
   fullscreen DVD-Rs. Now, being on DVD-R makes no difference to me 
   (digital is digital as long as there is no compression), but in this 
   day and age, not to offer the film in widescreen was quite a letdown 
   (VCI has since changed the description of the films' formats on their 
   website). Don't get me wrong; nearly 75% of the films I review on 
   here are from fullscreen VHS tapes or DVD-R copies of VHS tapes, so 
   fullscreen never bothered me, but I heard that even Steve Barkett was 
   less than pleased (to put it politely) at the way VCI treated both of 
   his films. I'm a realist. If I can get a film in widescreen over 
   fullscreen, I will go for the widescreen version every time. But 
   since it looks like VCI Entertainment is not going to offer a 
   widescreen version of this film anytime in the near future, I'll have 
   to review the fullscreen DVD-R, which looks great, by the way (For 
   those of you against DVD-R, there's not much I can do to convince you 
   that the quality is the same as a pressed DVD and DVD-Rs have failure 
   rates a lot less than pressed DVDs, but I got into a long discussion 
   on Facebook about it and learned one thing: People against DVD-R are 
   never going to change their mind, no matter how many facts you throw 
   at them and to not purchase this film based on this fact alone makes 
   you look foolish in my eyes). Now let's get into the film, because 
   like Steve Barrett's previous directorial film, he wrote the 
   screenplay to this one, too, and it is quite complex. In the early 
   1970's, beneath Stonehenge during a full moon, there is a chamber 
   where evil sorcerer Arkham (Richard Harrison; <B><A HREF="#ScorpionThunderbolt">S</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="#ScorpionThunderbolt">C</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><A HREF="#ScorpionThunderbolt">ORPION
    THUNDERBOLT</A></B> - 1985) stabs a pregnant woman in the stomach 
   with a sacrificial dagger and he licks the blood off the blade. It 
   revives a long-dormant large horned demon that was waiting to be 
   revived in a hole in the chamber. Arkham tells the demon to be 
   patient, some day he will be free for good. We then switch to police 
   officer Richard Flynn (Steve Barkett), also in the early 1970's, who 
   gets a frantic call from Angela (Tera Hendrickson) for him to come 
   over to the Maple Street Warehouse, a building that husband-to-be 
   Brian (Dan Speaker) owns. Richard is quite perplexed, because a few 
   hours ago, Angela told Richard that she never wanted to see him again 
   (I smell infidelity!) since she had Brian's baby and thinks it would 
   be best if she marries him. But now Angela is acting like it is a 
   life or death situation (it is) and needs Richard to come to the 
   warehouse as soon as possible. Richard tells her he will be there in 
   thirty minutes (when he is off his shift!) and when he gets there, he 
   hears Angela scream out, &quot;Richard, help me!&quot;. He blows the 
   lock off the door with his handgun (a six-shooter, which will come 
   into play many times in this film) and sees a huge hole in the wall 
   of the basement of the warehouse, that leads into some sort of 
   alternate dimension. Richard must shoot and kill a bunch of hooded 
   demons (one who bites him; at one time I counted 12 shots coming from 
   his gun without reloading!) in order to get close to Angela and her 
   baby, who are both on an altar; Brian holding a knife over the baby 
   and Arkham holding his dagger over Angela. Angela begs Richard to 
   save her baby, and with only one bullet left in his gun, he shoots 
   and kills Brian, saving the baby. Arkhan ends up stabbing Angela and 
   killing her, but Richard gets his revenge by beating Arkham to death 
   with the butt of his gun. He grabs the baby and runs towards to hole 
   in the wall when he sees it getting smaller and smaller, almost 
   falling off a rickety old wooden bridge into the lava below, but he 
   manages to jump through the hole just as it disappears. Twenty years 
   pass (Richard gives the baby to an orphanage because he want nothing 
   that is Brian's) and Richard has left the police force to become a 
   bounty hunter. A couple of years ago, Richard suddenly decided that 
   he had to learn how to swordfight, so he hires a sexy broad (besides 
   a few character names, no other actor is given a character name in 
   the beginning or closing credits, so I can't tell you her name) to 
   teach him a few times a week. He becomes quite good at it, even 
   though he keeps hitting on her. He already has a girlfriend named 
   Stacey Brent (Patricia Schiotis), who is also a bounty hunter. Police 
   Detective Eddie Green (Jay Richardson; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Tomb Werewolf">THE
    UNLIVING</A></B> - 2003) is talking on the phone when Terry Nash 
   (Christopher Barkett, the real-life son of Steve), the son of Angela, 
   asks Eddie for his help because Richard refuses to take his phone 
   calls or answer his letters. He tells Eddie an &quot;incredible 
   story&quot; (one we are not privy to) and then shows Eddie a 
   photograph of Brian and Arkham standing next to a modern car, which 
   proves that they are still alive because the photo was taken just two 
   weeks ago. Eddie agrees to help Terry and drives him to see Richard. 
   Richard, on the other hand, is following a bounty into a grocery 
   store when Eddie spots his car in the grocery store parking lot. 
   Thinking that Richard is there getting groceries, he yells out 
   Richard's name, just as Richard was about to bum-rush his bounty. The 
   perp has a shotgun and there is a free-for-all gunfight, as patrons 
   run out the door and the bounty kills two women shoppers in cold 
   blood. He then takes a young girl hostage, which gives Richard 
   flashbacks from twenty years ago when he saved the baby. Terry throws 
   a loaf of bread, which distracts the perp just long enough for 
   Richard to shoot his bounty a few times, killing him. Richard once 
   again blows off Terry after looking at the photo, saying that it is 
   easy to alter photos (but not as easy as it is now!). He then walks 
   out of the grocery store, leaving Eddie and Terry holding their dicks 
   in their hands (and he's <A HREF="empire_of_the_dark_1991.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/empire of the dark dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="195" HEIGHT="267" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>one
    of Eddie's best friends!). Meanwhile, Stacey has a meeting with 
   psychic investigator Guy Zupan (&quot;Josef Pilato&quot;, a.k.a. Joe 
   Pilato, Rhodes in <B><A HREF="day_of_the_dead.htm">DAY OF THE DEAD</A></B> 
   - 1985) to talk about the &quot;Demon Stalker&quot; case, one of the 
   worst cases of serial killing in years. Zupan tells Stacey that the 
   Demon Slasher has killed ten girls and ten more girls will die before 
   the next full moon (We see one such girl, when the giant demon tears 
   the doors off a parked car of two teens making out and kills the guy 
   and kidnaps the girl). Zupan knows all this because 20 years ago, his 
   daughter was killed by Arkham in the same ceremony (she was the girl 
   we saw killed in the beginning of the film), so he has become an 
   expert on Arkham and Brian's cult. Zupan warns Stacey that both 
   Arkham and Brian are within the boundaries of town, so she should be 
   very careful (advice she does not take). I'm not going to tell you 
   any more about the plot, because if I do, it will deprive you on one 
   of the batshit craziest films of the 90's. The film is so twisted and 
   weird, that the final thirty minutes will have your complete 
   attention because it is apparent that Steve Barkett blew most of his 
   budget on the ultra-bloody final half hour, which includes 
   stop-motion animation, automatic gunfire, headless corpses, 
   dismemberment, seductresses in lingerie (who show their true faces 
   when rebuffed), plenty of bloody bullet squibs, interdimensional 
   travel, sacrifices, tons of gore, bodies pulled apart, some pretty 
   impressive miniature model work, a nun saying, &quot;Bullshit!&quot; 
   and nearly anything else you can think of. Say what you want about 
   Steve Barkett, but when he commits to a film, he literally throws 
   himself into it (he even edited this film and worked on some of the 
   special effects). While he just makes it as a competant actor (he 
   does get in some funny lines) and has appeared in such films as <B><A HREF="beverly_hills_vamp_1989.htm">BEVERLY

   and others (mostly in small roles), it is his directorial and 
   screenwriting talents that shine. This is unlike any film you are 
   about to see any time soon and it makes me seriously wonder why 
   Barkett hasn't directed more films. We all need to watch something 
   different every now and then and judging by Barkett's only two 
   directorial films, that is exactly what you get. This film was 
   co-produced by Fred Olen Ray (with Barkett's wife Patricia), which 
   would explain the appearances of Dawn Wildsmith as medium Madame 
   Oleska and Jay Richardson, who has a much bigger role than normal 
   (always a good thing). Do yourself a favor and invest in this film, 
   fullscreen or not. You will be completely entertained for 96 minutes.

   swordfight stunt double and plays one of the hooded demons, but there

   (1984), before leaving the acting business to become an author of 
   filmmaking books and then dying of a heart attack in 2006. Ms. Harmon 
   (and her thick German accent) stars here as Chris, a woman unjustly 
   committed to an insane asylum where her husband, Alex (Henry Lewis), 
   is a doctor. Alex is cheating on Chris with hospital nurse Inez 
   (Susette Andres), but when Inez threatens to tell Chris of the 
   affair, Alex injects her with an overdose of an opiate, killing her. 
   Alex, along with asylum head Dr. Harper (Frank Neuhaus), are using 
   Chris' family fortune to fund illicit experiments on the 
   &quot;retards&quot; in the asylum. When one of the braindead retards, 
   Paul (Steven Neuhardt), suddenly awakens, slits an orderly's throat 
   and escapes, he follows a recently released Chris (Alex and Dr. 
   Harper have hatched a plan to drive her permanently insane) and 
   stepdaughter Becky (Lauren Brent) to a<A HREF="escape_from_the_insane_asylum_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/escape from the insane asylum aka night of terror british vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="288" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   &quot;haunted&quot; house in the mountains (as luck would have it, it 
   is the recently murdered Inez's house!), where Chris plans to 
   convalesce. She begins to have horrible visions and nightmares 
   (footage lifted from <B>FROZEN SCREAM</B>) and is chased around the 
   house by someone wearing a black hood, while creepy stuff (such as a 
   hamburger patty turning into a dead rat!) begins happening to her 
   that no one else can see, including Becky and nosy neighbor Ellen 
   (Lynn Whitmire), who just happens to be Dr Harper's wife (Oooh, I 
   smell a conspiracy!). Chris and Ellen become fast friends and go to a 
   fancy pool party thrown by Dr. Harper (where an awful New Wave band 
   called &quot;Inz 'N' Outz&quot; are playing), where Paul's psychic 
   mother, Celeste (Arline Specht), warns Chris to leave Inez's house 
   and go back to the safety of civilization. Unsurprisingly, it turns 
   out that most of this is a ploy by Alex and Dr. Harper to drive Chris 
   insane so Alex can become executor of her vast fortune, but when the 
   house turns out to really be haunted and the ghost of Inez leads 
   Chris to the truth, she may get the upper hand on her husband. When 
   Chris overhears Alex talking on the phone about having Paul (who is 
   recaptured) murder her when she is recommitted, Chris escapes in her 
   car, with Alex following her. Chris is captured, brought to the 
   asylum and nearly killed, but the ghost of Inez appears (her face 
   melts like wax in <B><A HREF="raiders_of_the_lost_ark_1981.htm">RAIDERS
    OF THE LOST ARK</A></B> - 1981) and scares Alex and Dr. Harper to 
   death. Chris, Becky and Paul live happily ever after.&nbsp; As 
   directed by one-time wonder Felix Gerard, <B>ESCAPE FROM THE INSANE ASYLUM</B> 
   is a complete mess. Not only does it have the cheap look of a 
   mid-80's porno film, with barebones sets (check out Dr. Harper's bar 
   at the pool party or the insane asylum sets for lessons in 
   minimalism), muffled sound recording (where the music and foley 
   effects drown out the dialogue), hamfisted editing (really, it looks 
   like someone was holding an entire ham while editing this, as scenes 
   jump from one sequence to the next with jarring jumps in sound to 
   match) and flat photography (it looks like it was shot on video, but 
   it's actually 16mm film); it's also shot so dark (many of the night 
   scenes look to have been shot without the aide of external lighting), 
   a clear 50% of the film is nearly unwatchable. Despite all these 
   faults and Ms. Harmon's questionable acting ability (although, to be 
   fair, the rest of the cast isn't that hot, either), this film works 
   on a psychedelic level, like you are watching someone's fragmented 
   fever dream. While the plot may be a jumbled mess (thanks to Ms. 
   Harmon and her skewed understanding of the English language), with a 
   subplot about Becky and a bunch of teens, who decide to check out 
   &quot;the haunted McFarland place&quot;, that leads nowhere, the film 
   as a whole works for some strange reason. I just can't put my finger 
   on it. It has minimal blood and gore (most of the gore is from the <B>FROZEN
    SCREAM</B> inserts), no nudity (although there are many shots of 
   young women in bikinis and Ms. Harmon dons some spandex for a gym 
   workout) and hardly any foul language, but it does have a funny Ouija 
   board scene, a sequence where a hooker is picked from the streets and 
   killed (I'm still trying to figure out what it has to do with the 
   rest of the film), gratuitous New Wave music inserts and lots of 
   dialogue scenes where Ms. Harmon talks to herself while mangling the 
   English language. I don't know why, but this is my favorite Renee 
   Harmon film. Maybe it's because it is her last or maybe because I'm 
   just a masochist at heart. You decide. Also starring James Lewis, 
   Marian Wayne, Jan Vandenberg, Ivan Corda, Joni Barns and Graham 
   Galloway. Image Entertainment supposedly released this on laserdisc 
   in the late 80's, but I have yet to see a copy of it anywhere, 
   though. The U.S. VHS release (as <B>NIGHT OF TERROR</B>), from Video 
   Pictures Corp., is about as rare as they come and commands big bucks 
   in collectors circles. The print I viewed was sourced from the 
   Australian VHS tape on the Palace Explosive Video label. <B>Not Rated</B>.
    <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">UPDATE:</FONT></B> It turns out this isn't

   cultist place candles around a large white triangle on the ground. At 
   the sharpest point of the triangle lays a photo of Peter Crane (Jorge 
   Rivero; <B><A HREF="action.htm#KillingMachine1984">KILLING MACHINE</A></B> 
   - 1984), as the red-robed leader of the cult enters the triangle and 
   makes the sign of the triangle with both his hands, framing the image 
   of Peter in the center of his makeshift hand triangle while muttering 
   something evil. We then see Peter having a nightmare (?) where naked 
   people are staring and pointing at him while a naked man gets in his 
   face. The phone then rings, waking Peter up. It's his girlfriend, 
   model Tanya (Pia Giancaro; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#RedQueenKills1972">THE
    RED QUEEN KILLS SEVEN TIMES</A></B> - 1972), and she reminds him 
   that they have a fashion show to go to that day. Peter realizes that 
   his house is full of guests from a party he threw the night before, 
   so he goes to his butler Walter (Eduardo Fajardo; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#KnifeOfIce1972">KNIFE
    OF ICE</A></B> - 1972) and tells him to get rid of them. Peter finds 
   friend Robby Gifford (Luis La Torre) in his shower and tells him 
   about his nightmare, which he can't get out of his head. Robby makes 
   a joke about how it was probably the alcohol he consumed last night 
   that led to the nightmare, but Peter is not amused, telling him it 
   all seemed so real.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Peter goes to the fashion show with Tanya and meets mysterious 
   French woman Yvonne Chevrel (Lone Fleming; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#FourthVictim1971">THE
    FOURTH VICTIM</A></B> - 1971). When he tells Yvonne his full name, 
   she tells him she had a nightmare last night that was strangely 
   similar to Peter's, only in her nightmare someone told her that 
   &quot;Peter Crane&quot; would murder her. Peter is not amused and 
   thinks Robby is playing a practical joke on him, so he calls Robby 
   and interrupts his poker game. Robby, who isn't happy about the 
   interruption (he is a degenerate gambler and he is losing money), 
   tells Peter he has no idea what he is talking about, he never heard 
   of Yvonne Chevrel and he told no one about his nightmare. Peter 
   thinks someone is playing a &quot;dirty trick&quot; on him, but we 
   know this is the work of a cult of Satanists. But why are they 
   targeting Peter?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A short time later, Yvonne meets Peter by his car and tells him that 
   she is scared, the nightmare isn't going away and she is having it 
   even in her waking moments (Peter has the same thing happening to 
   him). Peter assures her that he has no plans of doing her any harm, 
   especially murder, and invites her to his house for a drink, which 
   she accepts. At his house, Yvonne tells Peter that her husband is 
   recently deceased, so they, of course, kiss and then make love. While 
   they are going at it hot and heavy, Peter has a waking nightmare (?) 
   and is compelled to kill Yvonne, so he strangles her with his bare 
   hands, finishing her off by ripping out her throat. Peter wakes up 
   the following morning in his bed, but Yvonne is nowhere to be found. 
   He looks for Walter and finds him washing Peter's car. He asks Walter 
   if he cleaned the living room and he tells Peter no, he hasn't had 
   the time, his car was extremely dirty, so he decided to wash it 
   first. Not understanding what is going on and thinking it may be a 
   medical problem, Peter calls his deceased father's closest friend, 
   Dr, Stone (Richard Conte; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Possessor1975">THE
    POSSESSOR</A></B> - 1975), and makes an appointment to see him. In 
   his office, Peter tells Dr. Stone and his pretty colleague, Dr. Sarah 
   Turner (Pilar Velasquez; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#FlowerDeadlySting73">THE
    FLOWER WITH THE DEADLY STING</A></B> - 1973), about the nightmare he 
   has been having and they both assure him that there is nothing wrong 
   with him, all he has to do to clear everything up is to talk to Yvonne.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That is going to be extremely difficult, because we then see Police 
   Inspector Ranieri (Anthony Steffen; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#StrangersGundown69">THE
    STRANGER'S GUNDOWN</A></B> - 1969) and his unnamed partner (Alvaro 
   de Luna; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CountDraculasLove">COUNT 
   DRACULA'S GREAT LOVE</A></B> - 1972) in the morgue looking at 
   Yvonne's dead body (with her throat ripped open), saying it will be 
   difficult to find who killed her since she was found floating in the 
   river, the evidence of the killer's identity being washed away. We 
   then see Peter and Tanya brushing their teeth while taking a shower 
   together (!), when Peter gets a phone call from a mysterious man, who 
   tells him that he saw Peter kill Yvonne and to get a lot of money 
   together, then hangs up. Peter tells Tanya that he needs to be alone 
   for a while and drives off in his car. His car breaks down (?) next 
   to a mysterious house and Peter asks an old woman if he can use her 
   phone to call a tow truck. The house belongs to Derek Stevens 
   (Luciano Pigozzi, a.k.a. &quot;Alan Collins&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Devil7Faces1971">THE
    DEVIL WITH SEVEN FACES</A></B> - 1971) and his wife Elizabeth 
   (Daniela Giordano; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#GirlInRoom2A">GIRL 
   IN ROOM 2A</A></B> - 1973), who tell Peter that they met a long time 
   ago, but Peter doesn't remember them. When Peter goes to use the 
   phone, he finds the phone is dead, so Derek goes outside to look at 
   his car, leaving Peter alone with Elizabeth. She tries to hit on 
   Peter, but he tells her he has no memory of her. He notices a photo 
   of the old women and Elizabeth tells him it is her aunt...who died 
   two years ago! Something compels Peter to kill Elizabeth, so he 
   strangles her with his bare hands, ripping out her throat. When Derek 
   hears his wife's screams, he enters the house and Peter kills him in 
   the same way. It is obvious that Peter is being possessed by someone 
   or something, but why?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Peter locks himself in his bedroom and tells Walter he doesn't want 
   to see anyone. Dr. Stone pays him a visit (brushing off Walter's 
   warnings) and wants to know the truth about what is happening to him, 
   but Peter says he doesn't know. Dr. Stone tells Peter that he needs 
   to run tests on him, so Peter goes to Dr. Stone's clinic for head 
   x-rays and other tests. Dr. Stone can find nothing medically wrong 
   with Peter, but he tells him and Tanya that Peter must stay in his 
   clinic for at least a week for observation. The Inspector and his 
   partner arrive at Derek's house, where they find the bodies of Derek 
   and Elizabeth inside the house and the body of the old woman on the 
   property. The Inspector is stumped as to who the murderer may be, but 
   his wife, Sonja (Eva Vanicek), who is painting his portrait, tells 
   him that it is obvious that &quot;evil spirits&quot; are to blame for 
   the murders, but the Inspector tells her to stop being ridiculous, 
   there are no such things as evil spirits and even there were, he 
   can't arrest evil spirits. The Inspector may not believe in the 
   supernatural, but the supernatural believes in him and will play an 
   important part in what he does next.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While staying in the clinic, Peter hits on Sarah and she is 
   receptive, agreeing to go out to dinner with him, even though he is 
   still her patient (as they leave the clinic, all the smoked 
   cigarettes in Peter's ashtray begin to twirl and ignite on their 
   own). Sarah, of course, falls for Peter's charms and they make love 
   that night. He even manages not to kill her. When Peter gets back to 
   the clinic, there's a letter waiting for him that reads, <B>&quot;You're
    just wasting your time. No doctor on earth can cure you of being a killer.&quot;</B> 
   Of course, the letter is unsigned. That night, Peter has the 
   nightmare again while sleeping in his clinic room and when he wakes 
   up, it feels like his head is exploding. Peter tells Dr. Stone to 
   lock him up somewhere where he can't escape because he believes he is 
   being possessed by evil spirits and if he is locked up, the evil 
   spirits will realize that they can no longer make him kill and will 
   leave him alone. Dr. Stone plays along, locking Peter up in a padded 
   cell reserved for violent mental patients. A couple of days later, 
   Dr. Stone discovers that Peter has escaped his padded cell by hitting 
   on a pretty young nurse (!), so he calls the police because he 
   believes Peter is dangerous. We then see a possessed Peter going to 
   his house, where he discovers Robby is throwing one of his decadent 
   parties (we discover Robby is actually Peter's uncle and his past is 
   not so squeaky clean, as he may be responsible for the death of 
   Peter's father). Peter then strangles Robby, ripping his throat out. 
   The Inspector and his partner arrive at the clinic and Dr. Stone 
   tells them everything, but it is obvious that there is something very 
   wrong with the Inspector, as he begins to act exactly like Peter. He 
   walks down a road in the middle of the night in a trance, as a bus 
   pulls beside him, slowing down to pick him up. When he refuses to 
   acknowledge the bus, it pulls away, kicking up a rock that nearly 
   beans him on the head, snapping him out of the trance. Are the evil 
   spirits trying to kill him?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next morning, Peter goes back to his house, where he discovers 
   Walter and his wife (Terele Pavez, simply listed in the credits as 
   &quot;Terele&quot;) sleeping in his bed. When Peter confronts them, 
   Walter tells him it was he who made the phone call and sent him the 
   letter, saying he saw him kill Yvonne and next time he kills someone, 
   make sure the blinds on his windows are drawn. Walter then blackmails 
   him for a large sum of money, laughing in Peter's face like some 
   bourgeois swine. Peter runs out of his house and goes to Sarah's 
   apartment, where she tells him to stay put until she talks to Dr. 
   Stone. Sarah talks to Dr. Stone, who agrees to cancel his report to 
   the police against Peter (Can he do that?). While Sarah drives Peter 
   to her place in the country, believing all he needs is plenty of rest 
   and relaxation, we see the evil spirits are not too pleased with 
   Walter and his wife. The spirits possess Walter and he kills his 
   wife, bashing her on the head until it is a bloody pulp. When the 
   Inspector arrives at Peter's house, he sees Walter puking-up a frog 
   (!) and we watch as a rifle falls off a shelf and fires, hitting 
   Walter in the neck, killing him. The Inspector then goes to Dr. 
   Stone's office and demands to know the truth. Dr. Stone just sits in 
   his chair and stares at him not saying a word. The Inspector's 
   partner informs him that Sarah has a house in the country, so they 
   hop in a car and drive off. On their way to the country house, their 
   car mysteriously breaks down and the Inspector makes a veiled remark 
   that the breakdown is not accidental, Does he now believe in the 
   supernatural? We may never know, as the film ends on a WTF?!? note.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   nightmare! WTF?!? It makes absolutely no sense, trying to feed us a 
   line of bullshit that Peter is cursed to repeat this nightmare again 
   and again for all eternity, offering us no reason why Peter is cursed 
   to do so. All it really shows us is that screenwriters Siciliano, 
   Federico De Urrutia (<B><A HREF="relentless_four_1965.htm">THE 
   RELENTLESS FOUR</A></B> - 1965) and Julio Buchs (director of <B><A HREF="murder_by_music_1969.htm">MURDER

    BULLET FOR SANDOVAL</A></B> - 1969) has no idea how to end the film 
   properly, as they painted themselves into a corner with the 
   &quot;anything goes&quot; story. That's not to say that there's 
   nothing to enjoy here, as there are plenty of weird visuals to keep 
   our eyes, if not our brains, occupied, such as plenty of female 
   nudity, a couple of very gory kills, frog puking, decapitation by 
   train (well, not exactly a decapitation, but the top of a head being 
   sliced off by the train's wheels), the strange way Walter is shot in 
   the neck and other weirdness. It's not the worst film I have seen by 
   a long shot, but it certainly could have been much better, especially 
   when it comes to Inspector Ranieri. His part in the film just ends 
   abruptly, leaving us to wonder if he is possessed or if he is only 
   just pissed-off. We also have no idea why the satanic cult targeted 
   Peter. Was it because he was a womanizer or because he was rich? And 
   what about Dr. Stone's final scene? He just stares at the Inspector 
   intently, looking like the Devil himself. Is he supposed to be Satan? 
   That's the problem with the entire film. Major plot points are just 
   dropped with no explanation and many of the scenes just happen with 
   no connective tissue to the previous scene, leaving the viewer 
   confused and puzzled. If that was what they were going for, they 
   succeeded, but I seriously doubt that was their intention. I cannot 
   recommend this film, even though it does contain some good scary 
   scenes. But scares without story amounts to nothing, so proceed at 
   your own risk. I will say this: Composer <A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_3.htm#StelvioCipriani">Stelvio

   begins this early-80's minor masterpiece of revenge and retribution 
   that is only hampered from becoming more popular today by the ancient 
   computer technology on view (Me? I have no problem with it because I 
   lived and used every generation of home computer technology, but 
   kids, teens and even people in their 20's wouldn't understand that

   Middle Ages, where a defrocked priest named Father Lorenzo Esteban 
   (Richard Moll; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#SatansSupper1980">SATAN'S

    the Holy Church. Father Esteban holds a Satanic Bible (with a 
   jewel-encrusted pentagram on the cover) and a demonic sword in his 
   hands, as he and his followers walk down the beach and Father Esteban 
   stops and draws a pentagram in the sand with the sword. At a 
   makeshift altar (along with a large upside-down wooden crucifix 
   planted in the sand), he performs a Satanic ritual, where he strips a 
   young woman topless, beheads her with his sword and then (with a nice 
   editing trick) her flying head turns into a soccer ball, as we are 
   transported to 1981, where we watch the West Andover Military Academy 
   lose a soccer game to another military school, thanks to the 
   non-athletic abilities of nerdy West Andover Military cadet Stanley 
   Coopersmith (Clint Howard; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Ice Cream Man">ICE
    CREAM MAN</A></B> - 1994; who I always thought was the most talented 
   member of the Howard clan, which includes brother Ron and father 
   Rance, but they all have their own special talents). Stanley is 
   always being picked on because of his appearance, especially by 
   fellow cadet Bubba (<B><A HREF="that_70s_show_tv_series_1998-2006.htm">THAT
    70'S SHOW</A></B>'s Don Stark) and his clique, who are tired of 
   losing soccer games and nickname Stanley &quot;Cooperdick&quot;. The 
   Coach of the soccer team (Claude Earl Jones; <B><A HREF="dark_night_of_the_scarecrow_1981.htm">DARK
    NIGHT OF THE SCARECROW</A></B> - 1981) yells out in the locker room 
   that Academy rules state that every cadet gets equal tyime to play, 
   but he pulls Bubba aside and infers that if Stanley were to get 
   injured or banned somehow, he wouldn't have to play him. For some 
   reason, Stanley is on &quot;punishment duty&quot; (probably because 
   he was set-up by Bubba and his gang) and is tasked to clean out the 
   basement of the Academy's chapel, where a huge portrait of Father 
   Esteban hangs at the entrance to the chapel. The always-drunk and 
   over-the-hill Sarge (the late, great R.G. Armstrong; <B><A HREF="beast_within_1982.htm">THE
    BEAST WITHIN</A></B> - 1982), who works as the Academy's handyman. 
   lives in the chapel's basement and dislikes Stanley, too. While 
   Stanley is cleaning out the basement, Reverend Jameson (Joseph 
   Cortese; the mini-series and short-lived TV series <B><A HREF="something_is_out_there_tv_miniseries_1988.htm">SOMETHING
    IS OUT THERE</A></B> [1988 - 1989]) is gladhanding the Academy's 
   major financial contributor Mrs. Cauldwell (Sue Casey), the wife of a 
   Senator and Bubba's mother, telling her the history of Father Esteban 
   (I'm still flummoxed as to why his portrait hangs in the chapel when 
   the Reverend knows about his evil past). Stanley discovers some loose 
   bricks in one of the walls of the chapel's basement and when he pulls 
   all the bricks away, he finds a secret chamber full of old Satanic 
   books and Father Esteban's Satanic Bible (along with a baby fetus in 
   a glass jar!). He takes the Bible with him and then, that night, has 
   a nightmare of the baby in the jar coming to life. Bubba and his gang 
   keep harrassing Stanley, even making fun of his parents' deaths in a 
   car crash, telling him that maybe the &quot;Welfare lady&quot; will 
   come to see him on visiting day, making Stanley's life a living hell. 
   The only friends Stanley has at the Academy are fellow black cadet 
   Kowalski (Heywood Nelson; the TV series <B><A HREF="whats_happening_now_tv_series_1985-1988.htm">WHAT'S

   [1985 - 1988]) and head cook Jake (Lenny Montana; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Blood Song">BLOOD
    SONG</A></B> - 1982), who think that Stanley deserves better 
   treatment than he is getting and protect him the best they can. The 
   one real positive thing Stanley has going for him is that he is a 
   computer wiz and begins to translate Father Esteban's Spanish Satanic 
   Bible into a computer. One morning, Stanley wakes up only to find his 
   alarm clock has been unplugged and his clothes have been tied 
   together in tight knots, making him late for a class being taught by 
   Mr. Hauptman (Hamilton Camp, who acts like he is playing a German 
   officer on an episode of <B><A HREF="hogans_heroes_tv_series_1965-1971.htm">HOGAN'S
    HEROES</A></B> [1965 - 1971]). Hauptman sends Stanley to cruel 
   Academy head Colonel Kincaid (Charles Tyner; <B><A HREF="longest_yard_1974.htm">THE
    LONGEST YARD</A></B> - 1974), who whips Stanley on his ass and then 
   sends him on more &quot;punishment duty&quot; to feed the Academy's 
   boars their slop and to clean out their pens (I guess they use them 
   to make bacon and pork chops, but these are nothing like regular pink 
   pigs by any stretch of the imagination). Stanley accidentally leaves 
   the Satanic Bible behind and Colonel Kincaid's secretary, Miss 
   Friedemeyer (Lynn Hancock), tries to pry the jewel-encrusted 
   pentagran off the cover (unsuccessfully) and suddenly the boars go 
   crazy and try to kill Stanley. When Stanley returns to Kincaid's 
   office, he asks Miss Friedemeyer if she has seen his book and she 
   lies and says no. Jake takes pity on Stanley when he shows up late 
   for dinner and cooks him a nice steak meal. Jake shows him a litter 
   of puppies he is hiding and one is sickly and Jake says he probably 
   isn't going to make it. Stanley begs him to let him have the sickly 
   puppy (which he names &quot;Freddie&quot;), keeps him in the secret 
   room in the chapel basement and nurses him back to health (along with 
   Jake, who gives Stanley scraps left over from dinner to feed to 
   Freddie). Stanley begins to perform Satanic rituals in the secret 
   room with his computer as his altar, but nothing happens because it 
   says on the computer screen that it needs a blood sacrifice (and, no, 
   Stanley never considers using Freddie for such things since he really 
   loves the puppy). Stanley mistakenly thinks it works because when he 
   leaves the secret room, he is attacked by a group wearing pig masks 
   and robes and Stanley accidentally knocks himself out by banging his 
   head against a wall, not seeing that it was actually Bubba and his 
   clique playing another practical joke on him. When the drunk Sarge 
   discovers that Stanley borrowed his crowbar without his permission 
   and that he is keeping a puppy in the basement, he threatens to kill 
   Freddie and rape Stanley, but a big red pentagram appears on the 
   computer screen emblazened with the name &quot;ESTEBAN&quot; across 
   it and Sarge's head suddenly makes a 180&#176; turn (it's quite the 
   sight) and he dies. Next up is Miss Friedemeyer, who is taking a 
   shower (unenhanced boob alert!) when she hears a noise at her 
   bathroom door. She opens the door, only to discover a pack of hungry 
   boars waiting for her. They push her into the bathtub and chow down, 
   pulling her intestines out like sausage (it's quick, but you can see 
   it). Hey kids, see what happens when you lie? The Satanic Bible, 
   which is in her bedroom, then vanishes and reappears in the secret 
   room next to Stanley's computer. Stanley hides Sarge's body, just in 
   time to join Kowalski at the &quot;Miss Heavy Artillary&quot; beauty 
   pagent, where young women in skimpy bathing suits parade around the 
   cadets with the lecherous Coach as the Master of Ceremonies. Remember 
   when Coach told Bubba to put Stanley out of commission so he doesn't 
   play in the next soccer game? Well, now is the time, as Bubba and his 
   followers depants Stanley (in front of all the girls) and then 
   threaten Stanley to turn Freddie into sausage if he plays in the next 
   game. It all really doesn't matter much when a pantless Stanley is 
   discovered by Colonel Kincaid and permanently kicks him off the 
   soccer team for unbecoming behavior of a cadet. A drunk Bubba and his 
   gang bring the girls down to the chapel's basement, where they 
   discover the secret room along with the words &quot;blood 
   sacrifice&quot; on the computer screen. The callous Bubba kills and 
   slices up Freddie with a knife, but nothing happens because the 
   computer screen now says it needs to be human blood. When Stanley 
   discovers that Bubba and his sadistic gang have killed his furry 
   friend, Stanley goes into full Satanic mode to exact revenge. 
   Everyone at the Academy go to the chapel to pray for a win at 
   tomorrow's soccer game, while Hauptman looks for Stanley and Sarge in 
   the basement (Stanley is typing more verses from the Satanic Bible 
   into his computer). When Hauptman sees Stanley and says, &quot;What 
   in the Devil do you think you are doing?&quot; (talk about irony!), 
   Stanley gets superhuman powers and throws Hauptman up in the air, 
   impaling him on a large round wooden object with spikes hanging from 
   the ceiling and collects his blood in a chalice. He now has his blood 
   sacrifice and all Hell then literally begins to break loose as he 
   invokes Satan's name and, for a few moments, Stanley's face turns 
   into Father Esteban's. While Reverend Jameson blesses the soccer team 
   and gives his usual long-winded sermon (this one filled with many 
   groan-inducing references to soccer), one of the spikes from the 
   statue of Christ Crucified on the Cross comes loose, flies through 
   the air and impales the Reverend squarely in the forehead. Everyone 
   runs for the exit to no avail (the doors won't open), as the church 
   catches on fire, a hole opens in the chapel's floor, Stanley comes 
   through it floating in the air carrying Father Esteban's sword and 
   the pack of hungry boars follow him. Stanley cleaves Colonel 
   Kincaid's head in two. The boars start chewing on the cadets (the 
   lucky ones catch on fire and burn to death). Stanley decapitates one 
   of Bubba's cadet colleagues, as well as Coach, while the boars take 
   care of everyone else (In one scene, a cadet crawls into a ventiation 
   shaft followed by a boar. We then see a dismembered human arm fly out 
   of the<A HREF="evilspeak_1981_blu-ray.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/evilspeak blu-ray front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="260" HEIGHT="308" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   shaft.). Bubba locks himself in the rectory, but a boar breaks a hole 
   in the door and takes a bite out of his shoulder. Bubba makes it down 
   to the basement, but a reanimated Sarge grabs him by the neck, lifts 
   him off the floor and rips out his heart with his bare hands. The 
   film ends with the following coda: <B>&quot;Suffering from shock and 
   catatonic withdrawal, attributed to having witnessed the fiery death 
   of his dear friends and teachers, Stanley Coopersmith, sole survivor 
   of the tragic accident at West Andover Academy Chapel, was admitted 
   to Sunnyside Asylum. He remains there still.&quot;</B> Stanley's 
   computer reads, &quot;I, Stanley Coopersmith, will return. I WILL 
   RETURN!&quot; Too bad that there never was a sequel.&nbsp; This is a 
   great little slice of early-80's horror and gore, thanks to 
   director/co-writer/co-producer Eric Weston, who also directed such 
   films as <B><A HREF="iron_triangle_1989.htm">THE IRON TRIANGLE</A></B> 
   (1989), the above-average police actioner <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#To Protect">TO
    PROTECT AND SERVE</A></B> (1992) and the so-so horror film <B><A HREF="hyenas_2010.htm">HYENAS</A></B> 
   (2010), among others. He also produced <B><A HREF="treasure_of_the_moon_goddess_1987.htm">TREASURE
    OF THE MOON GODDESS</A></B> (1987), wrote the screenplay to <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#MerchantsOfWar">MERCHANTS
    OF WAR</A></B> (1988) and acted in the still unreleased-to-video <B><A HREF="farmer_1977.htm">THE
    FARMER</A></B> (1977; C'mon Walter Olsen, release it already!). He 
   still remains active in the business today (or at least when this 
   review was written in September 2015). This is the Unrated version of 
   the film, as the MPAA originally slapped it with an X-Rating until 
   many edits were made. Once you watch this version, you will know why. 
   Weston and Executive Producer Silvio Tabet have gone on record to 
   state that there is even more gore missing from the Unrated version, 
   but the footage seems to be lost, as they cut it out before it was 
   even submitted to the MPAA (The same thing was said about <B><A HREF="my_bloody_valentine_1981.htm">MY
    BLOODY VALENTINE</A></B> [1981], but the missing footage was 
   eventually discovered and released on DVD.). Clint Howard shows the 
   right amount of frustration as the much put-upon Stanley, putting on 
   a brave happy face for all his trials and trevails yet, for all the 
   bad things that are done to him, it is the death of his puppy Freddie 
   that really sets him off (I would feel the same way, too). The music 
   score, by Roger Kellaway, adds the right amount of creepiness, as it 
   is full of chanting and choir music which enhances many of the 
   scenes. Besides some hoary optical and then state-of-the-art computer 
   effects, the practical make-up effects (by Alan A. Apone, who later 
   did the effects for <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NeonManiacs1985">NEON
    MANIACS</A></B> - 1985) are bloody and well done (Charles Tyner's 
   death is a stand-out). Originally released on VHS by CBS/Fox Video in 
   the theatrical R-Rated cut. Anchor Bay released the Unrated version 
   on <A HREF="evilspeak_1981_anchor_bay_dvd.htm">DVD</A>, with&nbsp; a <A HREF="evilspeak_1981_dvd.htm">DVD</A> 
   &amp; <A HREF="evilspeak_1981_blu-ray.htm">Blu-Ray</A> of the Unrated 
   version (the Blu-Ray was released jointly between <A HREF="http://www.shoutfactory.com">Shout!
    Factory</A> and <A HREF="http://www.codereddvd.com">Code Red</A>) a 
   few years later. This review is based on the Blu-Ray, which looks 
   gorgeous (it was taken from a new high-def master supervised by Eric 
   Weston) and is so sharp, you can actually make out that the beheading 
   of the girl in the beginning and Claude Earl Jones' decapitation are 
   obvious dummies. All-on-all, a nice little time capsule of early-80's 
   horror full of great character actors. Also starring Louie Gravance, 
   Jim Greenleaf, Loren Lester, Leonard D'John (all as Bubba's clique), 
   Kathy McCullen, Bennett Liss, Katherine Kelly Lang and Robert Tafur.

   While that edition is a comic delight, it doesn't hold a candle to 
   the experience you'll have watching this, the theatrical release 
   version. The film opens with three poachers driving to the forest to 
   pilfer nightingale eggs (!) out of a tree (One poacher says to 
   another, &quot;Go get that ladder!&quot; and he replies, &quot;OK, 
   OK! Heil Hitler!&quot;). As they are stealing the eggs, one of the 
   poachers spots a bright light in the sky and watches it crash into 
   the forest. Also witnessing the crash is pre-teen Tommy (Oscar 
   Martin), who watches the bright light decend to Earth through his 
   telescope. The poacher leaves his two friends to fend for themselves, 
   steals their truck and drives to the crash site, where he enters a 
   cave and finds hundreds of alien eggs lying on the cave floor. Then 
   something attacks and kills him. Rock star Rick (Ian Serra, who we 
   see performing a terrible pop song in a recording studio, where an 
   obviously gay engineer is wearing an &quot;I'm<A HREF="extra_terrestrial_visitors_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pod people spanish poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   A Virgin&quot; t-shirt) and his entourage (including a quartet of 
   horny women) hop into an RV and head to this forest for a weekend of 
   rest and relaxation, while Tommy goes to the cave and steals one of 
   the eggs. While Ricky and his friends are sitting around a campfife, 
   Laura (Connie Cheston) goes for a walk in the woods and runs into the 
   two poachers, who chase her (One of the poachers says, &quot;Jesus, 
   that little bitch can run a lot faster than I thought!&quot;, to 
   which the other one replies, &quot;Well, you're a jerk!&quot; What?). 
   While Laura is running away, she almost runs into a strange furry 
   beast (we only see it's legs) and she ends up falling down a ravine, 
   seriously injuring herself. Rick and Brian (Emil Linder) rescue the 
   unconscious Laura and bring her back to the RV. Tommy, meanwhile, has 
   hidden the egg from his mother Molly (Susan Blake) and crusty Uncle 
   Bill (Frank Brana) by keeping it under his bed. Just as the egg 
   hatches, Rick and his gang pull up to Molly's house and ask to use 
   the telephone to call for help. The phone is dead (big surprise), so 
   Molly tells them to stay the night because a rock slide has blocked 
   off the only road to civilization. The two poachers (who don't seem 
   too concerned about their missing friend) get paid a visit by an 
   alien while they are sitting next to a campfire (One of them says 
   non-chalantly, &quot;What on Earth is that? Looks like a cross 
   between a pig and a bear.&quot; Actually, it looks more like a cross 
   between an elephant and a bear!). After saying, &quot;Be careful, it 
   could be dangerous!&quot; (duh!) and then talking to the alien as if 
   it were just another human being, the two poachers try to capture it 
   (&quot;You think it may be worth something?&quot;), but fail 
   terribly. After they try to subdue the alien (including sneaking up 
   behind it and then shooting it with a crossbow bolt), it slaughters 
   the two poachers. Tommy's pet alien, whom he dubs &quot;Trumpy&quot;, 
   grows to adult size in less than four hours, thanks to Tommy feeding 
   it saucers of milk and a jar of Planter's peanuts (I guess Reese's 
   Pieces weren't available). What Tommy doesn't know is that Trumpy is 
   able to shoot death rays out of it's eyes! Bill and Brian hop in 
   Bill's car to try and find a way out of the forest (after one of the 
   girls says, &quot;What a fuck-up this back-to-nature crap is!&quot;), 
   while Trumpy amazes Tommy with feats of magic and levitation, moving 
   objects around his bedroom (done using stop-motion animation) and 
   making a <B><A HREF="close_encounters_of_the_third_kind_1977.htm">CLOSE
    ENCOUNTERS</A></B> (1977)-like song play on Tommy's Simon toy 
   (Remember that fun plaything? After ten minutes playing with it, it 
   went on my pile of &quot;Toys To Never Be Played With Again&quot;). 
   Apparently, Laura has died (Bill alludes to it while speaking to 
   Brian in the car) and Tracy (Maria Albert) wants to watch <B><A HREF="dallas_tv_series_1978-1991.htm">DALLAS</A></B> 
   (1978 - 1991) on TV because, &quot;Seeing other people's problems 
   makes me forget mine.&quot; Bill and Brian drive to a Forest Rangers 
   cabin, where Brian is attacked and killed by the rogue alien. Trumpy 
   escapes from Tommy's bedroom, while Rick and girlfriend Sharon (Nina 
   Ferrer) worry why Brian and Bill haven't returned (Rick says, 
   &quot;Bill's as thick as two planks!&quot;). <A HREF="pod_people_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pod people vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Tommy
    spies Trumpy killing Tracy in the RV through his telescope, as an 
   injured Bill returns and gets off a shot at Trumpy with his shotgun, 
   but misses. Rick is getting antsy and wants to leave (He says, &quot;I
    ain't hanging about to find out who's next for the chop!&quot;), but 
   Bill and Molly talk him out of it (by simply stating, &quot;It's 
   getting dark outside!&quot;). Trumpy returns and tells Tommy that he 
   didn't kill Tracy, his brother did (!), so Tommy disguises Trumpy (by 
   putting a monk's robe on him!) and Trumpy spies on Kathy (Sarah 
   Palmer) while she takes a shower, scaring the shit out of her. Tommy 
   finally tells everyone about Trumpy and the other alien's existence 
   (&quot;They just want to be your friend, but nobody will let 
   them!&quot;), so they try to kill Trumpy! Tommy and Trumpy escape 
   into the forest, with everyone close behind, guns in hand. Bill gets 
   killed by the other alien and Rick then kills it witha couple of 
   rifle shots (the ground opens up and swallows the dead alien!). 
   Tommy, in a bit of false anger, shoos away Trumpy (&quot;Go away, I 
   hate you!&quot;) and rejoins his mother and Rick. The last we see 
   Trumpy, he's walking off into the fog-filled forest, all alone. The 
   End. Wow!&nbsp; This Spanish/French co-production is an obvious 
   rip-off of <B><A HREF="et_the_extra_terrestrial_1982.htm">E.T. THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL</A></B> 
   (1982), but since it was directed by Juan Piquer Simon (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Pieces">PIECES</A></B> 
   - 1982; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#SlugsTheMovie">SLUGS</A></B> - 
   1987; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Cthulhu Mansion">CTHULHU MANSION</A></B> 
   - 1990), you know you're in for something special and this film 
   delivers it in spades. It's apparent that Simon originally lensed 
   this as a gore film, but post-production editing (against Simon's 
   wishes) cut out all the gore (every time someone is about to get 
   killed, there's an obvious jump-cut) to make it more &quot;family 
   friendly&quot;, but they forgot to edit out all the foul language 
   (it's plentiful) and brief nudity (Do the gore inserts exist 
   anymore?). The script, by Simon and Joaquin Grau (who has his name 
   Anglicized to &quot;Jack Gray&quot;) is just one non-stop piece of 
   unbelievable dialogue after another and I was laughing until I had 
   tears in my eyes (I had to rewind a few times, just to make sure I 
   heard correctly!), due to the absurdity of it all. This film didn't 
   need the <B>MST3000 </B>treatment, because the acting, dialogue and 
   strange situations (there's so many scenes where day and night are in 
   the same scene, due to frequent editing errors, the timeline in this 
   film is like some surreal fairytale) all lend itself to self-parody. 
   Trumpy and his ilk are a marvel of bad make-up effects. They look 
   like someone took a dwarf, slapped a miniature bear costume on him 
   and then put a modified elephant mask on his head. I haven't seen a 
   costume this bad since <B><A HREF="robot_monster_1953.htm">ROBOT MONSTER</A></B> 
   (1953). The scene where Trumpy magically moves everything around in 
   Tommy's bedroom is a marvel of low-tech special effects and I nearly 
   coughed-up a lung when Trumpy transformed Tommy's telescope so that, 
   when he looked through it, he saw stock footage of elephants in 
   Africa (maybe a distant relative?). This is now one of my favorite 
   badfilms of all time and it should be one of your's, too. To sum it 
   up: Try to find the non-MST3000 version and enjoy it on it's own 
   twisted merits. You won't be sorry. Executive Producer Dick Randall 
   added some scenes from Don Dohler's <B><A HREF="galaxy_invader_1985.htm">GALAXY

   [1988; apparently 1988 was a good year for him!], just to mention a 
   few), is a better composer than he is a director, as he picks the 
   worst angles to film a scene and makes many other mistakes even a 
   novice director wouldn't commit (this was his second film). But as a 
   love letter to his wife, this film works, not for the viewer, but for 
   Stefania. It should also be noted that this was the last or 
   near-to-last film for some of the best Italian and English genre 
   actors, including Donald Pleasence (<B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#DevilsMen1976">THE

   you were dead instead and that wish being granted!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The film opens with some black and white footage showing a 
   grandfather making his grandson watch an 8mm reel of film showing a 
   tied-up, naked black woman being sliced open and then the footage 
   turns to color, showing a faceless killer in a big floppy black hat 
   slicing up a woman in a neon-lit alley with a machete, finishing her 
   off by chopping off her head and then videotaping the bloody carnage 
   he inflicted (Festa's way of contrasting the past [black &amp; white; 
   movie projector] with the present [vivid color; video camera]). We 
   are then shown one of Stefania's music videos, where she walks around 
   in thong panties and a bra singing &quot;Hey, hey, ah ah&quot; (dig 
   those lyrics!). Music video director Alex Ritt (Rick Gianasi; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Occultist1988">THE
    OCCULTIST</A></B> - 1988) is talking to Stefania's agent and 
   fianc&eacute; Daniel Antonucci (Leo Daniel), who offers Alex $100,000 
   for ten days work to direct a music video to Stefania's newest hit 
   &quot;Eternal City&quot; (hopefully, the lyrics are more involving!). 
   Alex accepts the offer and flies to Italy for the shoot. It couldn't 
   have come soon enough, because a short time earlier, Alex tells 
   Daniel he witnessed his girlfriend's brutal murder in his apartment, 
   showing Daniel that the rug he is standing on contains the blood of 
   his girlfriend's murder, telling Daniel that is all he has left of 
   her! Once in Italy, the strange stuff happens immediately, but is it 
   any stranger than keeping a rug containing your girlfriend's blood?!? 
   As Alex and Daniel are leaving the airport, a beggar (Omero Capanna; <B><A HREF="hearts_and_armour_1983.htm">HEARTS
    AND ARMOUR</A></B> - 1983) asks Alex for some money, but when he 
   touches Alex's hand, he gives him back the money, telling Alex (in 
   Italian) that he is cursed and now he is, too. Alex meets Stefania at 
   her limo, telling her that he enjoyed her last video because she has 
   a &quot;European look&quot; (she is Italian, after all!) and Stefania 
   rambles on (in stilted English; she's a terrible actress), spouting 
   some New Age mumbo jumbo.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Alex then meets ballet dancer Rebecca (Veronica Logan), a background 
   dancer in the upcoming music video, and when Alex discovers that she 
   is from Virginia, a romance blooms. When Alex goes to meet Rebecca 
   for dinner, he spots her on a fog-shrouded street (fog machines 
   around every corner) and she tells him to run away, so he runs toward 
   her instead, watching as the faceless killer in the floppy black hat 
   slices her with his machete, finishing her off by planting the 
   machete in her face. The killer then videotapes the aftermath of his 
   kill, as Alex flags down the police. Instead of listening to Alex, 
   they handcuff him and when he takes them to the location where 
   Rebecca was killed, nothing is there, not even a single drop of 
   blood. Police Commissioner Bonelli (David Warbeck; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#FormulaMurder1985">FORMULA
    FOR A MURDER</A></B> - 1985) tells Alex it was probably a practical 
   joke, even when Daniel tells him he can't find Rebecca. The police 
   find a videotape at a phone booth after getting an anonymous phone 
   call and it shows Rebecca's sliced-up corpse, so Alex becomes the 
   prime suspect and the police watch him closely. Alex is visited at 
   the music video shoot (yes, he is still the director!) by Bonelli, 
   who wants to know why he didn't tell him that Rebecca's death was 
   videotaped and he tells the Commissioner that he didn't see anyone 
   videotaping her murder. This just makes Alex look guiltier in 
   Bonelli's eyes, since he is well versed in using a camera (Hell, 
   anyone can use a video camera, as all those dreary found-footage 
   films taught us!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Parts of the music video are being filmed at a creepy mansion owned 
   and occupied by the even creepier Countess Alessandra Mirafiori 
   (Alida Valli; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#KillerNun1978">KILLER NUN</A></B> 
   - 1978), who insists that if they want to use her mansion, her 
   friend, Tamara (Nina Soldano; <B><A HREF="night_of_the_sharks_1988.htm">NIGHT
    OF THE SHARKS</A></B> - 1988), a medium, perform a s&eacute;ance. 
   Over Alex's objections, a s&eacute;ance is performed and Tamara is 
   possessed by the spirit of Rebecca, who accuses Alex of killing her. 
   Alex then accuses the Countess and Tamara of framing him and storms 
   out of the mansion. That night, Tamara phones Alex and tells him to 
   meet her and when he does, you guessed it, he watches as the faceless 
   killer in the floppy black hat (dubbed the &quot;Video Killer&quot; 
   by the press) slices up Tamara with a machete (they must be cheap in 
   Italy!) and watches helplessly as the killer videotapes his latest conquest.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Meanwhile, Commissioner Bonelli does a deep background search on 
   Alex and discovers his girlfriend back in Virginia was murdered in 
   the same way as the victims in Italy, making Alex even look more 
   guiltier in his eyes. Bonelli hires video forensics expert Dr. Lucidi 
   (Rossano Brazzi; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#PsychoutMurder1969">PSYCHOUT
    FOR MURDER</A></B> - 1969) to look at the footage of Alex's 
   girlfriend's death (yes, it was videotaped) to see if there are any 
   similarities in that video as there are in the ones in Italy. Dr 
   Lucidi finds remarkable similarities in that death and the ones here. 
   If Alex isn't the killer, is it possible that the killer traveled to 
   Italy to frame Alex? Enquiring minds want to know, but not Alex, who 
   believes someone wants him dead. Dr. Lucidi believes there is a 
   copycat killer on the loose, who kills to get Alex's approval. Alex 
   is contacted by parapsychologist Wendy Williams (Linnea Quigley; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightmareSisters">NIGHTMARE
    SISTERS</A></B> - 1987), who offers to prove to Alex that the 
   s&eacute;ance was a phony, a trick perpetrated by conmen (or, rather, 
   conwomen) to make him look guilty in everyone's eyes, but Alex is not 
   interested (does he want to look guilty to everyone???). Commissioner 
   Bonelli gets a phone call from Mr. Fairbrain (Geoffrey Copleston; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackCat1981">THE
    BLACK CAT</A></B> - 1981), who says that he is the father of Alex's 
   dead girlfriend, whom we discover wasn't his girlfriend at all, but 
   rather his wife! Mr. Fairbrain tells Bonelli that he is flying to 
   Italy, because he has something important to tell him (How come 
   people in films like this can't tell anyone secrets over the phone? 
   It would sure save them a lot of money for a plane ticket and a 
   hotel!), When Alex starts seeing his dead wife and Rebecca in his 
   nightmares (they both accuse him of killing them), he finally calls 
   Wendy Williams for some help. Things turn from bad to worse for Alex 
   when Bonelli hires FBI profiler Professor Robinson (a badly dubbed 
   Donald Pleasence; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#VampireInVenice1988">VAMPIRE
    IN VENICE</A></B> - 1988; in what amounts to an extended cameo), who 
   has hounded Alex for the past two years, believing he killed his wife 
   (Alex says to him in front of Bonelli, &quot;I'll rip off your head 
   and shove it up your ass! Then he (Bonelli) will have something to 
   arrest me for!&quot;). So how does this all turn out? Is Alex the 
   killer (he sure acts like he is)? Since I had to suffer through 125 
   minutes of drivel, do you think it would be fair for me to tell you? 
   Shouldn't you suffer too?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Besides being atrociously acted by Stefania Stella (<B><A HREF="sick_o_pathics_1996.htm">SICK-O-PATHICS</A></B> 
   - 1996) and Rick Gianasi (To be fair, Gianasi tries, but he is put in 
   situations so impossible, even the greatest actor in the world would 
   look bad), there are too many damn characters to keep track of. It's 
   like director Al Festa painted himself into a corner, as for every 
   character he adds to the plot adds ten minutes to its running time, 
   trying to explain why they are there. Donald Pleasence leaves the 
   film quite unexpectedly (he died during production), phoning Bonelli 
   and telling him that he has to go back to America, because an old 
   Halloween case has been reopened! We then see an obvious stand-in 
   walking away at the airport, as the theme from <B><A HREF="halloween_1978.htm">HALLOWEEN</A></B> 
   (1978) plays on the soundtrack! (Edited out of most prints for legal 
   reasons, but not the one I viewed.) The late Angus Scrimm (<B><A HREF="phantasm_1979.htm">PHANTASM</A></B> 
   - 1979) makes an appearance as a crazy person, who grabs Alex, says 
   something incomprehensible and then disappears for the rest of the 
   film. It is rather obvious that Festa was trying to cram the film 
   with as many horror film stars as he could find, thinking quantity 
   would overcome quality, but he was sadly mistaken. Even the music 
   performed by Stefania Stella is second rate, making you wonder why 
   she is so popular in Italy (was<A HREF="fatal_frames_1996.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/fatal frames poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="209" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   she really?). Like I said earlier, this is nothing but a vanity 
   production used to boost the ego of Festa's wife, but you will soon 
   wonder what happened to her, since she hasn't been in any 
   entertainment news...ever. While the violence is graphic and bloody 
   (lots of sliced skin and flying body parts), they are few and far 
   between. All we really have is a plot that goes off the rails rather 
   quickly and never recovers. I am sure a controlled substance or 
   plenty of booze (or both) will make this film seem better than it 
   actually is, but I gave up both a long time ago, so I had to suffer 
   through all 125 minutes of it, Unless you want to see Linnea Quigley 
   running with a machete planted in her neck, I would advise you to 
   avoid this film at all costs, even if it is offered to you for free.

   OK, now I will take pity on you and tell you how this film ends. 
   After all evidence points to Alex being the killer, we discover that 
   Mr. Fairbrain was behind the whole thing, masterminding Stefania into 
   helping him to expose Alex's guilt, because he believes Alex killed 
   his daughter and he wanted to frame him for the murders in Italy (It 
   makes no sense at all!). In the unbelievable finale, all the dead 
   women come back to life, point their fingers at Alex and call him a 
   murderer. Alex finally confesses to killing his wife, saying she was 
   going to leave him and &quot;She didn't have the right to leave 
   me!&quot; He then confesses to killing the other women, calling them 
   &quot;sluts&quot; and &quot;whores&quot; and we then discover that 
   Alex's wife was Stefania's sister! (Turns out that little boy in the 
   black and white opening is Alex, getting the idea for killing women 
   from watching the S&amp;M film with his sadistic grandfather!) 
   Commissioner Bonelli overhears everything and takes a laughing, then 
   crying, Alex away. Yes, it is finally over! Thank me when you leave

   (1984), Sweden's best and bloodiest martial arts film. After we watch 
   a crew of people filming Peter Savage (A.R. Hellquist; one of the 
   Executive Producers) water skiing and parasailing on a lake, we then 
   switch to the Speedo-wearing Mr. Savage and his bikini-clad squeeze 
   Suzy (Eva-Karin Bengtson) enjoying a soak in a hot tub. Savage's 
   boss, Bellamy (Frederick Offrein), enters to tell Savage he has an 
   interesting job for him (we still don't know Savage's profession 
   since the opening of the film is rather vague), but he will wait 
   until tomorrow to tell him (Why not just tell him now? Why, because 
   it will spoil what happens next!). When Bellamy and Suzy leave the 
   room, two guys enter and tell the short, but muscular, Savage not to 
   take the job. When Savage tells them he has no idea what they are 
   talking about (he really doesn't), one of the guys pulls a gun and 
   Savage gets a chance to show off his martial arts skills, throwing 
   both guys into the hot tub. We then switch to &quot;Dr. <A HREF="forgotten_wells_1989b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/forgotten wells poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Forham's
    Mental Institute&quot;, where someone in a black leather overcoat 
   and blue jeans (a wearing a white stocking over their head) frees a 
   patient whose face is bandaged and they both escape. We then find out 
   that Savage is a news reporter (!), as Bradley assigns him and his 
   crew to cover a story about the legend of Shequa Fall, an area that 
   has an old irrigation system containing several deep wells where, 
   twenty years earlier, the government forced the Tanner family to move 
   out after their ten year-old son got lost in the underground tunnel 
   system and was never found. Rumors abound that he is still alive and 
   an &quot;ape creature&quot; has been spotted in the area over the 
   years. In two days, the missing son will be legally declared dead 
   (there's a fortune to be inherited by the surviving family members), 
   so Bellamy wants Savage and his news crew to check out the place and 
   &quot;do what you do best&quot; (Huh?). Savage then gets a call from 
   police Lt. Craig Lammar (Gareth Hunt), who warns Savage not to go to 
   the old Tanner place until he talks to him in person first (He says, 
   &quot;Don't go in there like General Custer. You remember what 
   happened to him?&quot;), a request that Savage immediately ignores. 
   Meanwhile, the bandaged escaped mental patient (who the film is 
   extremely careful not to give a name) goes on a murder spree and 
   heads toward the Tanner place, where Savage and his crew have already 
   arrived. What happens next is a mixture of <B><A HREF="friday_the_13th_1980.htm">FRIDAY
    THE 13TH</A></B> (1980) and <A HREF="scooby_doo_animated_tv_series.htm">Scooby-Doo</A>,
    as Savage and his crew creep into the tunnels under the Tanner 
   place, while the bandaged psycho knocks them off one-by-one during a 
   torrential thunderstorm and Lt. Lammar, working on orders given by 
   old man Tanner (Taggen Axelson), sends some gun-toting hitmen to the 
   Tanner place to make sure no one makes it out alive. Will Savage 
   survive or will he become the lead story in the headline news?&nbsp; 
   This mind-boggling combination of horror and mystery, co-directed by

   - 1986), is so brain-fryingly awful that it transcends its 
   cranium-pulverizing putridness and becomes an exercise in 
   unintentional humor that should be seen by all. First off, almost 
   everyone in the cast (except for English actor Gareth Hunt) speaks 
   Swenglish, a combination of English with a Swedish accent that 
   manages to murder the English language (to add insult to injury, 
   Gareth Hunt tries his hand at a southern U.S. accent and fails 
   miserably). Secondly, anyone who actually believes this takes place 
   in the U.S. and that Pete Savage is a respected news reporter should 
   have their heads examined. The mulleted Savage is so short in stature 
   and butchers the English language so badly, I can't imagine any U.S. 
   TV news organization (with the exception of Fox News) who would want 
   him as a reporter, never mind an anchor. Thirdly, Helge's story (he 
   co-wrote the screenplay with Nilsson, Tina Ljung, Tim Earle, Gunnar 
   Trusso, Madeleine Bruze and star Hellquist) is way too complicated 
   for its own good and none of the many aspects of the script, whether 
   it be horror, mystery or revenge actioner, is properly fleshed-out 
   for anyone to give a damn what happens to anyone. Still, you have to 
   love the way the script has Savage lose his shirt numerous times so 
   the audience can watch him beat the snot out of the bad guys with his 
   diminutive muscular naked torso. The violence is rather tame (mainly 
   gun violence, as the bandaged psycho chooses to strangle his victims) 
   and there are only a couple of fleeting shots of topless female 
   nudity, so don't expect the usual Helge bloodbath. You can't beat <B><A HREF="forgotten_wells_1989c.htm">THE

   of this site are well aware, I am not a big fan of &quot;found 
   footage&quot; films. I usually find them headache-inducing, cheap and 
   downright lousy, but I'm glad to report that this film defies all 
   those categories and turns this unwelcomed genre on its head, 
   producing a weird, wild and downright entertaining movie that should 
   satisfy all fans of horror films. The first thing that separates it 
   from most films of the found footage genre is that it takes place 
   during World War II, where a platoon of<A HREF="frankensteins_army_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/frankenstein's army poster small2.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="328" HEIGHT="246" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Russian soldiers, led by Novikov (Robert Gwilyn), are deep within 
   Nazi territory, answering a distress call from another platoon of 
   Russian soldiers in a remote village. Following them around is 
   cameraman Dimitri (Alexander Mercury), who is filming their every 
   move with a handheld 16mm camera (way before videotape, so this film 
   looks great). On their way to the village, they begin to view some 
   strange things, like a human skeleton that doesn't look 100% human 
   and a dead German soldier's body in the woods, who's not quite dead 
   yet and looks to have some metal modification done to one of his 
   arms. When they get to the village, the first thing they notice is 
   that it is strangely empty and seems deserted until, that is, they 
   find a pile of human bodies stacked upon each other, smoldering like 
   they were part of a human bonfire (Vassili [played by Andrei Zayats], 
   the violent one in the platoon, spots a still-living female on top of 
   the burning pile and stabs her in the neck, killing her). They also 
   notice that every body in the village's graveyard has been dug up, 
   only empty coffins left in the graves. They decide to use the local 
   church as their headquarters, but once they are inside it, it looks 
   like no church they have ever been in (One of the platoon members 
   says, &quot;Looks like a factory.&quot;). When Sacha (Luke Newberry) 
   goes downstairs to turn on the generator and restores the 
   electricity, the first thing they encounter is a not-quite-human 
   body, with an electrical wire attached to its head, that becomes 
   reanimated and attacks Novikov. He lays there with his intestines 
   spilled all over the floor and Sergei (Joshua Sasse) mercifully kills 
   the not-quite-dead Novikov with his knife to stop his suffering. This 
   leaves Sergei in charge, which doesn't sit too well with sadistic 
   Vassili. For some reason, their radio is being jammed and they can't 
   call-out for help, so they begin searching the church and find a 
   bunch of animals in cages (Vassili grabs a rabbit and slams its body 
   against a table). As this is happening, Viktor (Karel Roden; <B><A HREF="hellboy_2004.htm">HELLBOY</A></B> 
   - 2004; <B><A HREF="abandoned_2006.htm">THE ABANDONED</A></B> - 
   2006), enters the room, is shot in the leg and is taken prisoner. 
   When he won't talk, Vassili cuts off one of his fingers. Viktor then 
   offers to take them to what they seek and leads them through a series 
   of labyrinth-like passageways until he disappears. Then all hell 
   breaks loose. The platoon is beseiged by a bunch of human-like 
   creatures with metal parts fused to their bodies (called 
   &quot;zombots&quot;), many of the parts taken from military weapons, 
   vehicles and aircraft (They should have known something was up when 
   they first entered the village. Just before they entered, there was a 
   strange vehicle that looked like a tank, but wasn't quite a tank. You 
   have to see it to understand it.). When Ivan (Hon Ping Tang), the 
   brute muscle of the platoon, has his head and helmet crushed together 
   by a zombot with a snapping bear trap-like device attached to its 
   head, the rest of the platoon rescue him and hold-out in another 
   building, where they run into Eva (Cristina Catalina), Nazi soldier 
   Fritz (Jan de Lukowicz) and a couple of other people also running 
   away from the zombots (None of them last long enough for us to feel 
   any empathy for them). Eva offers to remove the helmet from the 
   still-living Ivan's head, but when she does so, his brain is still in 
   the helmet! As the numbers begin to dwindle due to the attacks by a 
   variety of zombots, including one with an airplane propeller for a 
   head (Sergei cuts off its power, causing the propeller to break into 
   pieces, with one of the blades impaling Fritz in the head.), we 
   discover that it was cameraman Dimitri jamming their radio signals. 
   It turns out that the Russian government knows about Viktor's 
   experiments (he's a descendent of the Frankenstein family, as we find 
   out when Dimitri films Viktor's living quarters, where we see a 
   painting of the original Dr. Frankenstein and a living female head 
   attached to the body of a stuffed teddy bear encased in a glass 
   cage!) and they want Dimitri to try and convince Viktor to join their 
   side. The rest of the platoon is disposable. When Dimitri ventures 
   off by himself, he discovers a huge refrigerated warehouse covered 
   with human bodies hanging on chains and follows one zombot as it 
   carries the still-living body of Hans (Zdenek Barinka), minus an arm, 
   on a car attached to railroad tracks. It leads him to Viktor and 
   Dimitri makes his offer. Before Viktor gives him an answer, Dimitri 
   watches as Victor and a strange female zombot remove half the brain 
   of Fritz and put it in the head of Sergei, who has had half of his 
   brain removed. Viktor hopes to achieve the best of both sides, 
   creating a Nazi/Russian hybrid with a portable handheld 
   &quot;generator&quot; of his own creation (the brain removal scenes 
   are all shown in loving close-up, including Viktor removing a piece 
   of Fritz's brain from Sergei's head because there is <A HREF="frankensteins_army_2013b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/frankenstein's army poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="169" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>&quot;too
    much&quot;!). Viktor then refuses Dimitri's offer and ties him to a 
   table, putting Dimitri's camera at his feet to record Dimitri's 
   transformation into a zombot. Before Viktor can operate, the allies 
   begin bombing the village and Viktor is shot dead by Sacha, who 
   cuts-off Viktor's head and takes it and Viktor's journals to safety, 
   leaving Dimitri strapped to the table to meet his doom.&nbsp; This is 
   by far one of the best (and funniest, but not in a &quot;ha-ha&quot; 
   kind of way) horror films to come down the pike in quite a while. 
   Dutch Director Richard Raaphorst, who also created the designs of the 
   zombots, hits a home run on his first feature film (He directed a 
   handfull of shorts before this.). The screenplay, by Chris W. 
   Mitchell and Miguel Tejada-Flores (<B><A HREF="fright_night_part_2_1988.htm">FRIGHT
    NIGHT PART 2</A></B> - 1988; <B><A HREF="screamers_1995.htm">SCREAMERS</A></B>

   - 2003), based on a story by Raaphorst (with a nod to Mary Shelley), 
   never takes itself too seriously, but be prepared for some extreme 
   gore and some of the strangest human/machine creations ever to grace 
   the screen. What I especially liked about this film is that most of 
   the effects and strange metal/flesh hybrids were done practically (by 
   Rogier Samuels and his crew), with a minimum of CGI employed. Believe 
   me when I say that you have not seen creatures like this before on 
   film. Some of these creations are downright surreal (I won't spoil 
   what some of the stranger ones look like, but think of Steampunk on 
   crack and you'll get an idea). For those of you worried that this is 
   a &quot;found footage&quot; type of film, let me relieve your fears 
   by saying that the camerawork is pretty smooth, with very little of 
   that &quot;shakey-cam&quot; technique applied that usually wrecks 
   most films in this genre for me. The film does stop a few times while 
   Dimitri changes to a new cartridge, but it doesn't hurt the movie at 
   all. I recommend this film to all readers of this site. <B><A HREF="frankensteins_army_2013b.htm">FRANKENSTEIN'S

    MAN</A><A NAME="FunnyMan1994"></A> (1994) -</B> When Callum Chance 
   (Christopher Lee) loses his ancestral home in a game of high stakes 
   poker to record producer Max Taylor (Benny Young), after Max makes a 
   straight flush using the Joker as a wild card (Callum only had a pair 
   of deuces, so it's apparent he wanted to lose), Callum makes the 
   following statement to Max: &quot;You're a funny man, Mr. Taylor, but 
   I've met funnier. And so will you.&quot; Truer words were never 
   spoken. Max moves his family, including wife Tina (Ingrid Lacey), 
   teenage daughter Jamie (Jamie Heard) and young son Harry (Harry 
   Heard), into the Chance ancestral home and it's not long before the 
   Chance family curse, in the shape of a grotesque hunchbacked court 
   jester known as the Funny Man (Tim James, who is marvelous in the 
   role), begins terrorizing and killing the Taylor family, beginning 
   with young Harry. Meanwhile, Max's ex-rocker brother Johnny (Matthew 
   Devitt) is driving a van full of Max's personal belongings to the 
   Chance home, when he stops to pick up four hitch-hikers: Frumpy bird 
   watcher Thelma Fudd (Rhona Cameron), a &quot;Crap Puppeteer&quot; 
   (George Morton), a &quot;Hard Man&quot; (Chris Walker), and a 
   &quot;Psychic Commando&quot; (Paulene Black), a black woman who reads 
   tarot cards and knows that they<A HREF="funny_man_1994.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/funny man dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="203" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   are all heading into serious and deadly trouble. By the time Johnny 
   and the four hitch-hikers make it to the Chance ancestral home, the 
   Funny Man has already killed Harry (off-screen), Tina (bloodily 
   bludgeoned to death) and Jamie (electrocuted and burned to death when 
   jumper cables are attached to her ears) and Max has disappeared. The 
   Psychic Commando warns everyone about a bad presence in the house 
   (after she injects some unknown drug between her fingers), but Johnny 
   disregards the warning and has everyone split up to look for his 
   brother and his family. This gives the Funny Man ample opportunities 
   to dispatch them in various bloody, yet comical, ways. Max is going 
   on a nightmare tour of the house, riding through the hallways and 
   rooms while trapped in a shopping cart like it's some cheap carnival 
   horror house ride. Johnny makes some discoveries about Max's 
   treachery towards him (like Mick Jagger wanting Johnny to become a 
   member of the Rolling Stones, but Max kept the letter and never told 
   him), so it's up to the Psychic Commando (who can now shoot rockets 
   from her fingertips!) to do battle with the Funny Man, but is she 
   strong enough to defeat him? Sadly, no, but Johnny gets his wish to 
   be a rock star before being sent to Rock 'N' Roll Heaven and Max gets 
   to suffer an eternal fate that's far worse than death.&nbsp; This 
   British horror comedy, directed and written by Simon Sprackling (his 
   only feature-length directorial effort), is, for the most part, a 
   funny, scary thrill ride, but there are a few times when the low 
   budget shows its edges and some of the accents could have benefited 
   by the use of subtitles. Some of the deaths on view are downright 
   ingenious, such as when the bespectacled Thelma (who is a dead-ringer 
   for Velma on <B><A HREF="scooby_doo_animated_tv_series.htm">SCOOBY-DOO</A></B>)
    has her brains and eyeballs blown out of her head (with her 
   eyeglasses still attached!) and they go flying through the air, 
   landing in a cooking vat; or when the Crap Puppeteer has the top of 
   his head and hands blown off when they are used in the Funny Man's 
   twisted Punch &amp; Judy puppet show. The overall effectiveness of 
   the Funny Man character is cheapened somewhat by having him speak 
   directly to the camera, like we are in on the joke. I could have done 
   without those bits because it reminds the viewer that we are watching 
   a movie, but as the film progresses, it gets a little darker in tone 
   and much bloodier (the Hard Man has a woman's high heel shoe jammed 
   in his eye; the Funny Man gorily bursting through the Psychic 
   Commando's body; Max's final fate is a sight that won't easily be 
   forgotten [and it looks painful as hell]). Some of the set designs 
   are also very good (the titty bar scene had me in stitches), as are 
   the various disguises that the Funny Man wears throughout the film. 
   As far as horror comedies go, <B><A HREF="funny_man_1994b.htm">FUNNY MAN</A></B> 
   is one of the best the 90's had to offer. Although Christopher Lee's 
   screen time is minimal here (and it's implied that this whole film 
   may be nothing other than a fantasy played-out in the obviously 
   insane Callum's mind), he does sing the title tune (with a children's 
   choir!) during the closing credits: &quot;Funny Man, Funny Man. He's 
   cheeky and he's cruel. Funny Man, the naughty Funny Man. He'll play 
   you for a fool. The joke's on you!&quot; Priceless. Also featuring

    They make it to Spain (thanks to footage borrowed from <B><A HREF="my_name_is_nobody_1973.htm">MY
    NAME IS NOBODY</A></B> - 1973), where the Princess shows the 
   Stranger her castle, telling him it was built by the Moors years ago 
   to protect her people from the Barbarians. She then tells him about 
   the &quot;Treasure of Rodrigo&quot;, which gets the Stranger's 
   undivided attention. The treasure is hidden somewhere and only their 
   General, Emir (George Rigaud; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Eyeball1975">EYEBALL</A></B> 
   - 1975), knows where it is. Suddenly, they are stuck in the middle of 
   a large-scale battle between the Moors and the Barbarians. A huge 
   battle ensues, the Barbarians using a unique cannon setup (multiple 
   cannons mounted on a revolving lazy susan!) and the Moors using guns 
   and swords (lots of impalements and cut faces). The Barbarians win, 
   the Moors retreating, their General seriously injured. The head of 
   the Barbarians, Shakespeare-quoting hunchback Sombra (co-screenwriter 
   Lloyd Battista; <B><A HREF="stranger_spaghetti_western_series_1967-1968.htm">THE
    SILENT STRANGER</A></B> - 1968; also with Anthony) has to rein-in 
   the brutish Diego (Raf Baldassarre; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Zambo1972">ZAMBO,
    KING OF THE JUNGLE</A></B> - 1972) from killing the Stranger. 
   Instead of killing him, they string him up by his feet and leave him 
   there, the gay member (!) of the Barbarians, Alfonso (David Dreyer; <B><A HREF="fuzz_1972.htm">FUZZ</A></B> 
   - 1972), laughing as they take the Princess prisoner and head back to 
   the castle (Alfonso says of the Princess: &quot;She's not a Princess, 
   she's an ill-bred bitch!&quot;). The Stranger hangs there for hours 
   in the blazing sun, until beautiful gypsy woman Morelia (Mirta 
   Miller; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CountDraculasLove">COUNT 
   DRACULA'S GREAT LOVE</A></B> - 1972) frees him and takes him to her 
   village. He meets a dying General Emir and asks for his $50,000, only 
   to be told that when they find Rodrigo's Treasure he'll be paid. The 
   General dies, but before he does, he mentions &quot;a temple in the 
   mountains&quot; to Morelia. Is this where the treasure is hidden?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Barbarians then attack the village and, once again, the Stranger 
   gets the upper hand, making one Barbarian hold up two other 
   Barbarians by their feet over a steep wall, as payback for him being 
   hung up by his feet. The Barbarian's arms get tired and he drops his 
   comrades on their heads on the rocks below, killing them. The 
   Stranger then rides to the castle, asking Alfonso to take him to 
   their leader (Alfonso says, &quot;Move that animal and I'll take you 
   there!&quot; in his effeminate voice). The Stranger says to the crowd 
   gathered, &quot;Nobody get nervous, because I come in peace!&quot; 
   and then proceeds to talk to the Barbarians as if they were cavemen, 
   offering them beads and other trinkets as a sign of friendship. This 
   only makes Diego mad and, once again, Sombra has to calm him down. 
   Sombra, who quotes Shakespeare's Richard III (He thinks he is the 
   reincarnation of Richard III!), tries to talk to the Stranger, but he 
   has no idea what he is saying, pissing off the hunchback (They really 
   should have used hunchback actor Luciano Rossi [<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DeathSmilesMurder73">DEATH
    SMILES ON A MURDERER</A></B> - 1973] for this role, as there would 
   be no need for extra padding on his back!). The Stranger offers a 
   trade, Rodrigo's Treasure for the Princess, and Sombra agrees, but 
   the Stranger still has no idea where the treasure is. He finds the 
   Princess tied to a rack and Sombra agrees to free her if he takes him 
   to the treasure. The Stranger then sees a very surreal Barbarian 
   party, where a bunch of lesbians are making out, while a group of 
   blind men watch them! (The Stranger says, &quot;Oh, dear God, they 
   got some ugly women in this country!&quot;) The Princess is then told 
   that in order for her to get her hands on the treasure, she will 
   first have to go through the &quot;Trials of Death&quot;, an ancient 
   ritual where danger and death lurk around every corner. The Stranger 
   takes her place and what he goes through next is a real piece of 
   surreal cinema. The Stranger enters a cave filled with coffins and 
   begins to howl like a wolf, as invisible fists punch him in the face 
   (He says, &quot;All you people in those coffins, I don't believe in 
   such stuff, so don't you try turning me into a wolf!&quot;). In the 
   cave, he is almost blown-up and when he exits it, he discovers his 
   whole body has turned black (when he looks down his pants and sees 
   his penis is black, he screams!). He is then chased around by a bull 
   and falls down a crevasse into another cave, where he steals a small 
   gold horse statue. The Stranger then enters an old temple, where 
   Diego is waiting for him, wanting to know where the treasure is. He 
   hands the horse statue to him and says, &quot;But, mister, now you 
   got to get me a doctor, because I turned black all over and I think 
   I'm gonna die!&quot; Diego is not happy and searches Diego and a 
   piece of jewelry called the &quot;Scorpion's Sting&quot; falls from 
   his body. Alfonso, who is visibly frightened, says that the 
   Scorpion's Sting brings death to whomever claims it and hands it to 
   the Stranger. He is then tied-up and placed on a platter of what 
   looks like the world's biggest salad, looking like a pig about to be 
   roasted, a potato in his mouth! Sombra then gets into a fencing match 
   with Morelia and kills her when she tries to run away, stabbing her 
   in the back with his rapier. The Stranger is then roasted over a 
   spit, Sombra saying to Diego, &quot;The flames are very low, so it's 
   up to you whether he be rare, medium or well done!&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Alfonso, who is disguised as one of the red-hooded members of the 
   Barbarian cult, frees the Stranger, as long as he agrees to take him 
   to the treasure. Once free, the Stranger turns the tables on Alfonso, 
   making him swallow a large ball of wax (!), and telling him to 
   deliver that message to Sombra. Sombra and Diego force-feed Alfonso 
   like a &quot;stuffed turkey&quot; until his &quot;message&quot; is 
   delivered (WTF?!?). Alfonso eventually passes the ball of wax and 
   Sombra and Diego discover that the wax concealed the Scorpion's Sting 
   inside it (a portend of things to come).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Stranger is tired of all the abuse, now is the time for him to 
   &quot;Get Mean&quot;. But first he is captured by the lesbians, who 
   use him for their pleasure! Alfonso appears and challenges the 
   Stranger to a duel, slapping him across the face and saying that the 
   weapons are of the Stranger's choosing. The Stranger then gives 
   Alfonso a series of slaps and the lesbians pile-on the gay Barbarian. 
   The Stranger says, &quot;What a country. Women are men and men are 
   women!&quot; The Stranger shoots dynamite-laced arrows over the 
   castle walls, causing mass confusion for the Barbarians. When they 
   put the revolving cannons in place, the scared Barbarians retreat, 
   leaving Sombra by himself. The Stranger kills Diego's men with his 
   four-barrelled shotgun (!), leaving Diego and the Stranger to battle 
   it out, mano-a-mano. He pours gunpowder down Diego's throat and, as 
   he convulses, the Stranger finishing him off with his pistol. 
   &quot;You're worse than trash. You're garbage!&quot; says the 
   Stranger, shoving a potato in Diego's mouth. The disembodied voice of 
   the Stranger taunts Sombra, who accidentally discovers Rodrigo's 
   Treasure when an errant cannonball exposes it. Sombra kills Alfonso 
   by burning him alive, as the Stranger approaches him (multiple 
   dynamite explosions behind him, in a very effective scene). Sombra 
   pleads for his life, saying, &quot;I am Richard III, King of all of 
   England!&quot; as the Stranger challenges him to a duel, his cannons 
   against his six-shooter. As Sombra's cannons miss him, the Stranger 
   kills him with his pistol. &quot;The King is dead. Long live the King 
   or whatever they say.&quot; are the Stranger's final words, as he 
   exits this strange country called Spain and returns to America (cue

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Wow. Just wow. While watching this film (recommended to me by my 
   friend Steven. Thanks Steven!), all I could think of was how it 
   resembled Sam Raimi's <B><A HREF="army_of_darkness_1992.htm">ARMY OF DARKNESS</A></B> 
   (1992; thanks once again Steven!), making me wonder if Raimi saw this 
   film before he made his. Besides horses and six-shooters, this really 
   is not a Spaghetti Western in the traditional sense (or even in the 
   non-traditional sense!), but a fantasy adventure film with Vikings 
   (although we never hear that word), Moors, supernatural elements and 
   above all, a strong gay subtext that is tossed in the viewer's face, 
   something you never see in a Spaghetti Western (or any Western). 
   Director Ferdinando Baldi, who made many Spaghetti Westerns, as well 
   as the brutal thriller <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#TerrorExpress1979">TERROR
    EXPRESS</A></B> (1979) and the actioners <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#WarBus">WAR
    BUS</A></B> (1985) and <B><A HREF="action.htm#JustADamnedSoldier">JUST
    A DAMNED SOLDIER</A></B> (1988; his final film), was also 
   responsible for the film that kicked-off the early-'80s 3-D craze, <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#CominAtYa">COMIN'
    AT YA!</A></B> (1981) and its companion piece, <B><A HREF="treasure_of_the_four_crowns_1983.htm">TREASURE
    OF THE FOUR CROWNS</A></B> (1983), both starring Tony Anthony. 
   Speaking of Tony Anthony, he made a series of &quot;<B><A HREF="stranger_spaghetti_western_series_1967-1968.htm">STRANGER</A></B>&quot;
    Spaghetti Western films in the late-'60s and basically carried-over 
   that character to this film, although with more dialogue. When it 
   comes to really &quot;out there&quot; films, this one is hard to 
   beat. The battle scenes are large in scope (and it needs to be seen 
   in widescreen to appreciate the large quantity of background actors 
   who were hired to participate in the battles) and there is a sense of 
   brutality herein, even though it is basically played for broad 
   comedy. It's also hard to believe that this gained a PG Rating when 
   released to U.S. theaters (distributed by Cee Note Inc., a company I 
   never heard of before), but it doesn't surprise me because many adult 
   themed films in the '70s achieved that rating, deservedly or not. 
   Recommended for both Western and weird film lovers (you know who you 
   are!). As far as I can discern, this never obtained a legitimate VHS 
   release in the United States, making its first appearance on these 
   shores as a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack from <A HREF="http://www.blue-underground.com">Blue
    Underground</A> in 2015 (It was released on DVD and Blu-Ray in 
   Germany under the name <B><A HREF="get_mean_1975.htm#TimeBreaker">TIME
    BREAKER</A></B>). I saw it in widescreen on YouTube (Thanks again 
   for the link, Steven!), which seems to be the go-to site for 
   undiscovered gems like this one. I will be purchasing the Blue 
   Underground disc set because I always want to do the right thing (and 
   BU always delivers the goods in primo fashion). Also starring Sherman

   While most reviewers have given this obscure film bad press as a 
   hokey monster flick, I believe that they&#146;ve missed the whole 
   point of this film. Sure, it contains a badly-assembled mutant 8 foot 
   sheep (yeah, you heard me right), but I doubt that is all 
   director/producer/writer Fredric Hobbs (who was also responsible for 
   the title creation) was aiming for in this film. It is also a 
   finely-crafted piece of political Americana. There are actually two 
   monsters here: One is the mutant sheep.<A HREF="godmonster_of_indian_flats_1973c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/godmonster of indian flats.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   The other is more dangerous. He is the mayor and patriarch of 
   Comstock, Nevada, a historical wild west tourist trap. He controls 
   the town with an iron fist, keeping tabs on the local citizens by 
   means of electronic surveilance and is not above committing murder to 
   keep his town under control. The subplot deals with a mutant sheep 
   being born due to escaping yellow phosphorous gas from a nearby mine. 
   A scientist takes the fetus to his lab in Indian Flats (located next 
   to Comstock) and nurses it to adulthood. Meanwhile, a representative 
   from a huge corporation comes to Comstock in hopes of buying the 
   town&#146;s mining rights. The mayor has eyes on the mining rights 
   for himself and sets-up the representative on a trumped-up attempted 
   murder charge. The mayor gathers up an old-fashioned vigilante group 
   and tries to hang the rep, but he escapes and ends up at the 
   laboratory at Indian Flats. Events that follow lead to the mutant 
   sheep escaping and causing havoc in Comstock. The mayor orders 
   &quot;the damaged mongoloid beast&quot; to be captured alive so he 
   can display it to paying customers (&quot;Feast your eyes on the 8th 
   Wonder of the World!&quot;). The finale is a surreal experience as 
   the townspeople turn on the monster and the mayor. You have to see it 
   to believe it.&nbsp; Director Fredric Hobbs (</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="roseland_1970.htm">ROSELAND</A></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">

   contains a dog funeral, assorted bad guys (one is a disgraced Wall

   mutant sheep. The most unusual aspect of this film is that the 
   corporate representative is the only black man in this film and not

   Lamberto Bava-directed film twice during the early morning and both 
   times I fell asleep, so I decided that the next time I would make it 
   the first film I watch for the night. All I can say, after watching 
   it straight through for the very first time, is that I kept wishing I 
   was sleepy, because this was the longest 91 minutes of my life. While

   master course of style over substance, as it is very atmospheric, but 
   nonsensical, the fact is you'll be wanting to kill the five young 
   people who make up the cast, because they do and say things no human 
   being from this planet ever would. These three dicks and two cunts 
   (That may sound harsh, but I'm actually being polite!) are perfect 
   examples of people who don't deserve to live, because they do the 
   most hurtful and asinine things to each other, as well as talk as no 
   person I ever heard and say idiotic things to people they don't know, 
   that you'll be wondering if they are human or some kind of alien that 
   has watched too much of Earth's TV and believe this is the way all 
   humans act. Either way, you'll be wishing them all a painful death, 
   but you'll be severely disappointed in the way this film concludes. 
   Frankly, it makes absolutely no sense at all, as it is merely a way 
   for the filmmakers to write themselves out of a corner they painted

   ad hoc getaway driver. After stealing two chocolate bars (Really?) 
   and getting caught by the shopkeeper (portrayed by 
   director/co-screenwriter Lamberto Bava), the four punks quickly pile 
   into the van and Johnny takes off, worried that they will get caught 
   by the police (over two chocolate bars, really?). Sure enough, the 
   shopkeeper tells the cops that he wants them arrested and they nearly 
   get caught at a police roadblock (over two chocolate bars, really?), 
   but Johnny guns it and blows past the roadblock, nearly killing two 
   cops in the process (over two chocolate bars, really?). Johnny and 
   the gang get lost in a heavy fog and end up in a cut-rate version of

    After hearing wolves howling and seeing a driverless horse-drawn 
   funeral carriage, Johnny crosses a shallow river with his van trying 
   to find the nearest town, but the second river he tries to cross 
   proves to be far deeper than it seemed to be, causing the van to 
   stall out and get stuck in the middle of the river, forcing the 
   quintet to hoof it on foot. After seeing a weird local with a light 
   blinking out of his left eye, who refuses to acknowledge they even 
   exist, darkness approaches and they must find some place to sleep. 
   They discover giant unknown animal footprints in the dirt (which is 
   dropped from the plot as soon as they are shown) and find the ruins 
   of an old, ancient church and decide to sleep there, ignoring a stone 
   grave marker containing the warning of a curse to those who enter 
   here, written in Latin (What's surprising is that David knows Latin 
   and translates it!). While they are sleeping, a stranger with a 
   glowing red eye watches them, waking up Robin, who then wakes up his 
   friends. After failing to locate the stranger (he totally disappears 
   from the rest of the film), the group of high school dropouts 
   discover that they were sleeping on the roof of a tavern (complete 
   with a &quot;Miller High Life&quot; neon sign!) and decide to enter

   answer, he thrusts his &quot;missing&quot; arm out of the fly of his 
   trousers (!) and everyone in the tavern laughs, except for the 
   overage teens, thinking that the joke was funny (It actually is, 
   because we didn't expect such somber people to have a sense of humor).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Micky has to use the &quot;ladies&quot; and the tavern keeper tells 
   her it is upstairs, where she finds a large glass goblet full of 
   valuable jewelry and cash (as well as an American Express card!). She 
   yells to her friends to come take a look at it and the tavern keeper 
   tells them that the goblet contains the valuables left there by 
   people who failed to win a contest. When David asks what the contest 
   is, he is told that if you put money in the goblet, you must spend 
   the entire night in a crypt located in the catacombs beneath the 
   tavern (The tavern keeper tells the kids that the crypt is considered 
   &quot;Hell's waiting room&quot;, failing to elaborate on the remark). 
   If you spend the entire night in the crypt and come out at dawn, you 
   can collect everything in the goblet as a reward. David gets the 
   bright idea to be the next person to participate in the contest (he 
   throws his entire wallet into the goblet!), telling his friends to 
   come to the crypt when the tavern closes, because as long as they are 
   all together nothing bad can happen to them. Wanna bet?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The tavern keeper leads David to the locked iron gate that leads to 
   the basement of the tavern, accompanying him a short way to a ladder 
   that will lead him below to the catacombs and then the crypt, 
   laughing the entire time. He hands David a lantern and then leaves 
   David alone to find his way. David's friends leave the tavern and 
   patiently wait for it to close, not realizing that the tavern keeper 
   is fully aware that they are coming back to join David, even 
   unlocking the iron gate so they can do so. When the tavern keeper 
   closes up shop (where it is revealed he has a working TV!), the four 
   clueless teens enter the tavern to join their friend, but they cannot 
   find David in the creepy, cobweb-filled catacombs, which are full of 
   decaying corpses and skeletons (we see the jaw of one skeleton 
   chattering, which is a physical impossibility). It turns out David is 
   playing a practical joke on them, jumping out of the darkness and 
   scaring the shit out of his friends (If I had a gun, I would have 
   shot him in the head, but the other four laugh it off like it is no 
   biggie). When Micky pushes her brother into a rotting coffin, it 
   breaks open and a corpse of a zombie comes out of it, but instead of 
   attacking the kids, he opens up another coffin of a female zombie and 
   puts his hand on one of her breasts! She slaps him and slams the 
   coffin lid shut. It's obvious that Bava is trying to insert some 
   humor into the film, but the sad fact is it fails miserably and seems 
   like a sorry attempt to excuse bad filmmaking.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    As expected in films like this, the group gets separated and Robin 
   falls into a pit filled with water containing body parts and 
   skeletons of corpses, as well as a giant eyeball creature that swims 
   in the water and tries to attack Robin, but he escapes the pit (after 
   seeing a vision of all his friends dead, calling for him to climb up 
   and join them). Unfortunately, his friends aren't dead and he soon 
   joins Tina, who also got separated from her friends. We then see a <A HREF="graveyard_disturbance_1988.htm#EightEyes">zombie
    woman with eight eyeballs</A> (two regular ones and six scattered 
   about her rather large forehead in no particular order) as she serves 
   a formal dinner to her zombie family (one zombie has two large buck 
   teeth and another has one large sharp tooth sticking out the middle 
   of his mouth), which consists of apples infested with worms, 
   centipedes in worm sauce and some mystery meat, all of it disgusting. 
   When Robin and Tina enter the room, all the zombies scream and jump 
   in their coffins, closing the lids (another bad, but weird, attempt 
   at humor).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As dawn approaches (David can't wait to get his hands on the loot), 
   we see the police finding Johnny's van overturned in a ravine, making 
   audiences believe that the five teens are dead and in Hell. When the 
   police look in the van, they find it empty and we see the tavern 
   keeper telling David and his group that they have won the contest, so 
   they greedily take everything out of the glass goblet, stuffing the 
   money into their pockets and wearing the expensive jewelry, while the 
   tavern keeper laughs wildly and then transforms into a rotting zombie 
   version of the Grim Reaper, complete with scythe! The teens think 
   they are dead, too, and run out of the tavern, only to get arrested 
   by the police for petty larceny (over two chocolate bars, really?). 
   The film ends there, as the teens are handcuffed and put into the 
   back of police cars. WTF?!?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   (1989), none of them giallo flicks. These are horror films sprinkled 
   with grotesque scenes of humor, none of them funny at all, but some 
   people find them memorable just for their weirdness and WTF?!? 
   strangeness (but not me), such as this film's 8-eyed zombie lady 
   presiding over a formal dinner, played for humor rather broadly. If I 
   were forced to mention one good thing about this film, it would be 
   that the zombie makeups are very well done, as is the catacombs set. 
   The crew involved in covering the catacombs with cobwebs went a 
   little overboard, as everything seems to have a thick layer of the 
   stuff covering it. I am also surprised that some reviewers actually 
   like this film, stating it is like watching a movie shot in some 
   alternate dimension, but I don't see it. To me, it is nothing but a 
   badly written film where the &quot;actors&quot; spout their lines 
   like they think every normal person does. Here's what Tina says 
   during one point in the film: &quot;Let's get one thing straight. I 
   like silly, fun things, like candy, Christmas carols, Woody Allen, 
   things like that. I made a decision never to die because it gives me 
   the creeps!&quot; Does any teenager actually talk like that? In the 
   finale, the group decides that the ditzy Micky is the best person to 
   find a way out of the catacombs. Let's just say that this is an 
   alternate dimension I never wish to visit. Couple that with the truly 
   mind-boggling denouement, which reeks of pure desperation, and this 
   is a film I wish never to revisit again. It's not the worst of the 
   four films (that would be <B><A HREF="demons_3_the_ogre_1988.htm">DEMONS

   &quot;My son is a crapper. He craps in the bed, he crapped on his 
   mother's leg and he crapped on top of the TV!&quot;</B> Every once in 
   a while I find a strange film in my mailbox. I get sent many films, 
   usually the ones that aren't worth the plastic they are recorded on, 
   but every so often something comes along that is so unusual, so 
   twisted, that you can't help but sit up and take notice. This is one 
   of those films. Not only did it make me think long after I watched 
   it, but I actually had a nightmare about it the night that I did view 
   it. I can't say that about many films. You don't usually see me 
   mention the words &quot;cult&quot; and &quot;films&quot; in the same 
   sentence (I think <A HREF="greasy_strangler_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/greasy strangler blu-ray front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="286" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>that
    the audience makes it a cult film, not the filmmakers) but this is 
   guaranteed to be a cult film in the years to come. You'll think the 
   same thing once you see it too. It hits all the right notes, will 
   make you want to retch at some of the visuals and doesn't shy away 
   from anything, This is&nbsp; early John Waters territory, if he were 
   on LSD (that is a good thing). The acting comes from another planet. 
   but it works beautifully within the confines of this film, there are 
   lines of dialogue that will make you laugh out loud (it is all in the 
   delivery) and there is graphic full frontal male and female nudity 
   (the filmmakers said that all of the penises in this film were 
   prosthetic, but they are still disgusting!). Rather than giving my 
   regular spoiler-filled review (I would rather let you discover it), 
   I'll just touch the surface of this instantly memorable film (which 
   was produced by of all people, actor Elijah Wood! [<B><A HREF="maniac_2012.htm">MANIAC</A></B> 
   - 2012]). A brief description: Beer-bellied and man-boobed Big 
   Brayden (Sky Elobar; who delivers his lines like he comes from an 
   alternate Earth) and his cranky, big man-boobed, balding white-haired 
   father, Big Ronnie (Michael St. Michael; whom you may remember was 
   the star of <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Video Dead">THE VIDEO DEAD</A></B> 
   - 1987), run a tour of closed discos in the Los Angeles area, where 
   daddy makes up stories about the Bee Gees, Michael Jackson and John 
   Travolta (He tells his son that back in the 70's , he was a disco 
   king that hobnobbed with all the big disco stars!). They have four 
   paying tourists on this walking tour and when an Indian tourist (Sam 
   Dissanayake; who does an extremely funny bit a little later in the 
   film when he mispronounces the word &quot;potato&quot;) asks for 
   verification of his story, Big Ronnie says, &quot;What are you a 
   bullshit artist?!?&quot; (you'll be hearing that word a lot in this 
   film, but it never grows old) and pulls down his pink disco shorts 
   and farts in their direction (The pink outfits that both father and 
   son wear shows their nipples protruding from their man-boobs! They 
   almost look like <A HREF="greasy_strangler_2016_man_boobs_photo.htm">transsexuals</A>!).
    The tourist also mentions that free drinks were mentioned in the 
   brochure and Big Ronnie yells out &quot;No Free drinks!&quot; Another 
   tourist, Janet (Elizabeth De Razzo; she was &quot;Maria&quot; on the 
   funny HBO Comedy series <B><A HREF="eastbound_and_down_2010-2013.htm">EASTBOUND
    &amp; DOWN</A></B> [2010 - 2013]) catches Big Brayden's eye and they 
   start a romantic relationship, much to Big Ronnie's displeasure. He 
   tries to ruin the relationship by any means, even parading around 
   naked in the house (Big Ronnie has a huge dick, while Big Brayden has 
   a tiny one!). There is also a serial killer on the loose known as <A HREF="greasy_strangler_2016_photo.htm">The
    Greasy Strangler</A> who chokes people to death and eats their eyes. 
   We know almost immediately That Big Ronnie is the serial killer, as 
   we watch him kill the three tourists that gave him the most trouble 
   on that morning's tour. He throws the Scandinavian tourist (Holland 
   MacFallister) through the glass of a vending machine, rips the face 
   off the Senegalese tourist (Abdoulaye NGom) until all that is left is 
   the back of his head (!), and chokes out the Indian tourist (who 
   says, &quot;Am I dying?&quot;). Big Ronnie is slathered in cooking 
   grease and he gets it off of him by walking through a car wash 
   totally naked, where the blind proprietor, Big Paul (Gil Gex), thinks 
   that Big Ronnie is getting his car washed. He tells Big Brayden that 
   he is the Greasy Strangler, but he doesn't believe him, saying &quot;I
    call bullshit! You're a bullshit artist!&quot;, but it is rather 
   obvious that he is because he likes cooking grease in his coffee, on 
   hotdogs and even on his morning grapefruit! He is a grease junkie. 
   While there is plenty of violence, it is all done for comedy effect, 
   such as when he chokes out a hotdog vendor (Mel Kohl) for not putting 
   grease on his hot dog (&quot;I could lose my job!&quot;) until <A HREF="greasy_strangler_2016_hotdog_vendor_poster.htm">his
    eyes pop out</A>! He grabs the eyes, fries them up and eats them. 
   While this film contains some scenes that will likely make you wanna 
   puke (Check out Big Ronnie disco dancing with his huge penis shaking 
   in the wind while a spotlight follows him<A HREF="greasy_strangler_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/greasy strangler 2016 poster14 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   around), it is basically a love story at heart. Even though Big 
   Ronnie always tells people Big Brayden is a &quot;crapper&quot; 
   (there is nothing he hasn't taken a crap on, even though none of it 
   is true), he loves his son and you will be thinking about that long 
   after the film ends. How they deal with the romantic triangle proves 
   that love. There is no bond as strong as that of a father and son. 
   British director/co-screenwriter (with Toby Harvard) Jim Hosking also 
   directed the &quot;G Is For Grandad&quot; segment of <B><A HREF="abcs_of_death_2_2014.htm">THE
    ABCs OF DEATH 2</A></B> (2014), but God only knows where he got the 
   inspiration to make this weird and wonderful film (Maybe in a fever 
   dream?). The dialogue will make you laugh out loud (really!) because 
   he found the perfect two people to portray the father and son. They 
   deliver their lines like you have never heard before and they do it 
   with such pinach&eacute;, you'll be laughing at their delivery as 
   soon as they open their mouths. You will hear such precious dialogue 
   as: &quot;You claim her pussy, but you'll never claim her 
   heart!&quot;, the violence and gore looks like it came out of a 
   child's cartoon (including the sound effects) and the music 
   soundtrack, by Andrew Hung, sounds like early-80's video game music, 
   but everything that should fail hits on all cylinders here. I haven't 
   laughed this hard in a long, long time; my mouth was hurting when the 
   film ended. Highly recommended for people who like something totally 
   different than anything they have ever seen before. A strong stomach 
   is also recommended. Also starring Joe David Walters as 
   &quot;Oinker&quot;, a man who walks around with a pig nose; Dana Hass 
   as &quot;Big Heinie&quot;, a movie concession worker; Carl Solomon as 
   &quot;Danny The Crooner&quot; (must be seen to be believed!); and Sal 
   Koussa as &quot;Ricky Pickles&quot;, the man who stole Big Brayden's 
   mother away because he had six-pack abs. He has his ears ripped-off 
   and his eyes are roasted over a campfire like marshmallows! Still no 
   official U.S. disc release yet (it is available on DVD and Blu-Ray in 
   England and Germany and Austrailia sells a <A HREF="greasy_strangler_2016_australia_blu-ray.htm">double

    but Amazon offers it on DVD-R or <A HREF="greasy_strangler_2016.htm">BD-R</A> 
   for a fairly cheap price. (the BD-R is a &quot;Special Director's

   by the director and the two main stars, a red band trailer, and

   glad I did!)&nbsp; You can also watch it <A HREF="greasy_strangler_2016_amazon_posters.htm">streaming</A> 
   for free if you are an Amazon Prime member. This is one movie you 
   will want to own, if only to show it to people to see their 
   reactions. The original cut of the film was 135 minutes, but it was 
   shed of 42 minutes for the final version. When it does find a 
   legitimate distributor, maybe we will get both versions. <B>Not Rated</B>

   Here it is folks. The holy grail of unfinished and unreleased 80's 
   horror. The cast contains such well-known names as George Clooney, 
   Charlie Sheen (who passed on starring in <B><A HREF="karate_kid_1984.htm">THE
    KARATE KID</A></B> to appear in this!), Louise Fletcher, Laura Dern, 
   Deborah Raffin, John Rhys-Davies, Dick Anthony Williams, Charles 
   Cyphers, Marc Alaimo and Jack Starrett. The story is simple: The 
   crooked superintendant of Summit National Park (Fletcher) agrees to 
   have a huge rock concert in the park, much to the displeasure of the 
   park rangers, who feel they are spread too thin as it is. As luck 
   would have it, a 20 foot tall grizzly bear is wrecking vengeange in 
   the park, thanks to a poacher killing it's offspring for it's gall 
   bladder. When the grizzly kills the poacher, the other poachers (led 
   by Starrett) go hunting for it. The grizzly then kills three campers 
   (which includes a horny Clooney and Dern and a very young Sheen) and 
   makes it's way towards the concert. When the rangers start finding 
   the bodies of the grizzly's victims, they enlist the help of French 
   bear hunter Bouchard (Rhys-Davies) to track it down. This doesn't sit 
   too well with local grizzly bear conservationist Sam (Raffin), who 
   would rather capture it alive. Bouchard, Sam and head ranger 
   Hollister (Steve Inwood) go searching for the<A HREF="grizzly_2_the_predator_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/grizzly ii the predator faux poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="263" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   grizzly while the poachers shoot and injure another ranger (he 
   eventually ends up as a grizzly meal). The poachers dig a huge pit 
   with wooden stakes to kill the bear, but greed and the grizzly get to 
   them first. The grizzly makes it to the crowded concert (it arrives 
   backstage, so it must have had a pass) where it sets off the 
   pyrotechnics, impales Bouchard on a metal spike and flips the Jeep 
   Hollister and Sam are in. Hollister electrocutes the grizzly on stage 
   where the audience thinks it's part of the show (you gotta see that 
   shot to believe it) and applaud wildly. The End.&nbsp; Since this is 
   just a workprint, the film is in very rough shape. The temp music 
   soundtrack contains unauthorized tracks by Michael Jackson (&quot;Beat
    It&quot; and &quot;Wanna Be Starting Something&quot;) and the bear 
   is never seen until the finale. The attack scenes consist of reaction 
   shots of the&nbsp; actors waving their hands around their body and 
   screaming and when the bear is to be shown, all you see is a blank 
   screen. Since there is only the shots of the mechanical bear at the 
   end, it stands to reason that the other bear attack footage was to be 
   shot later on. All the sound on this workprint is live and no post-production
    looping is present. This is especially noticable when the actors 
   talk on police radios or telephones and the reply voices are coming 
   just off-camera. The question remains this: Would this have made a 
   good film if it were finished and released? It's hard to say. From 
   the footage I have seen, the film is not that bloody (the effects 
   shots were probably also to be added later) and the story is pretty 
   weak. The music acts in the concert, which consists of a bad early 
   80's New Wave all-girl singing group and an effiminate male headliner 
   who dresses in a silver metallic jump suit, dates the film severely. 
   The finale is unfinished and is represented as a series of outtakes, 
   but you can get the gist of how it's supposed to end by watching the 
   outtakes. It's the ecclectic cast that's the biggest draw. Seeing 
   George Clooney, Charlie Sheen and Laura Dern at such early stages in 
   their careers is a hoot, but their screen time amounts to less than 
   five minutes. There's a subplot about Hollister's daughter Christy 
   (Deborah Foreman) working as a gofer for the concert manager (Dick 
   Anthony Williams) and falling in love with the girly-man headliner 
   (before the concert, he prances around in a tight pair of short 
   shorts!), but it eventually leads nowhere. Cannon Films was supposed 
   to distribute this film, but went into bankruptcy, dooming this film 
   before it was finished (There were other factors involved, too, such 
   as the producer, Joseph Proctor, taking a lot of the production money 
   for his own use. He is still serving time in a federal prison for tax 
   evasion.) . Filmed partly in Budapest, the Hungarian government 
   seized most of the production's equipment for non-payment of bills. 
   This film was directed/executive produced/co-scripted by David 
   Sheldon (The unauthorized Hungarian [at least to director Sheldon and 
   his co-writing partner, wife Joan McCall] concert scenes were 
   directed by unknown Andr&eacute; Sz&ouml;ts at a real Russian Army 
   base [and it was advertised as a real concert attended by over 10,000 
   rabid Hungarian teens!], his only try at directing and failing 
   miserably. He had a nervous breakdown while filming, the concert was 
   called off and Sz&ouml;ts passed away in 2006), who co-wrote and 
   produced the original <B><A HREF="grizzly_1976.htm">GRIZZLY</A></B>

   80's. Don't you believe it. It is just one of those urban legends 
   that refuses to die. Another film, <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Claws1977">CLAWS</A></B>

   original film turned out to be an unexpected financial success. This

   in no way in any condition to be shown on TV or in theaters. This is 
   about as rare a find that I have ever received. I would like to thank 
   the person that sent it to me, but I'll leave his name anonymous so 
   he doesn't get clobbered with requests for copies (Thanks William 
   Wilson!). I know of no artwork for this film. If anyone has any 
   preproduction ads for this or any promotion material (the artwork for 
   this review is a fake poster created by a fan), please contact me at

   into the torrent community (and it wasn't me, no matter what that 
   turdburglar William Wilson claims; I have never uploaded a film to a 
   torrent site in my life and I would love to see asswipe's Wilson's 
   proof to the contrary) and some people have made their own fan edits, 
   inserting scenes from the first film to replicate the missing bear 
   attacks and reworking the music soundtrack. Some of the fan edits are 
   pretty good, while others are god-awful. According to sources, the 
   footage sits in a lab in Paris, while the soundtrack sits in a New 
   York vault. <B>NOTE 2:</B> For more information on the making of this

   Los Angeles on February 17, 2020! From what I have read, only fifteen

   and demands money from the Stackpools in exchange for keeping his 
   mouth shut about the experiments. Lance and Loretta will soon come to 
   regret messing around with the Stackpools. If this plot sounds

   (one has huge eyes and acute hearing while the other is just huge and 
   dumb with the strength of ten men) and sister (a looker with a great

   generations. That is, until recently. Their only surviving daughter, 
   Sau Ying (Tanny), was forced into an arranged marriage with abusive 
   Yeung (Wang Jung), in hopes of continuing the Chan family line with 
   some new blood (babies). Sau Ying has failed to get pregnant and 
   caught a bad lung ailment instead, forcing her to be bedridden. Sau 
   Ying's parents died of consumption and since her family name no 
   longer carries the clout it use to and divorce is not an option in 
   this society, the self-absorbed Yeung has turned to a life of 
   gambling, drinking, visiting prostitutes and abuses the only female 
   servant, Ah Sim, left on staff (Sau Ying and Yeung are dead flat 
   broke and all they have left to their name is the crumbling Chan 
   family mansion). When Ah Sim leaves the Chan's employ (She tells Sau<A HREF="hex_1980_and_the_sequels.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hex 1980 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Ying, &quot;I will not be his punch-bag!&quot;), the cruel Yeung 
   refuses to take care of Sau Ying as she grows sicker. Enter Leung Yi 
   Wah (Chen Szu-Chia), the daughter of a servant who once worked for 
   Sau Ying's mother. She shows up at the Chan's front door and offers 
   to attend to Sau Ying's needs, even though they can't afford to pay 
   her (When Sau Ying warns Leung of Yeung's bad temper, she responds, 
   &quot;Don't worry, I'll take good care of him.&quot;). When Leung 
   discovers the depths of depravity of Yeung's cruelty (She watches as 
   he slaps around a sickly Sau Ying for not lighting his cigarette!) 
   and he rapes her after she tells him &quot;You are not a man!&quot;, 
   Leung has had enough when he punches and kicks her and then steals 
   Sau Ying's jade bracelet (it was her mother's and the only thing Sau 
   Ying had left that had any monetary value) and uses it for gambling 
   and whores. She and Sau Ying drown him in a vat of water when he 
   returns home drunk and then throw his body into a nearby pond to make 
   it look like an accidental drowning (it's not the first time he has 
   fallen into the pond while walking home blind stinking drunk, so this 
   seems like an excellent plan). But, like all perfect murders, 
   something goes wrong and Yeung's body disappears from the pond and 
   Sau Ying begins having nightmares about being chased around the 
   mansion by Yeung's water-bloated corpse. She begins regretting 
   killing him and grows sicker and more delusional, while Leung tries 
   to hold it together as the village drains the pond due to an odorous 
   stench emanating from it. When nothing is found in the drained pond 
   except the rotting corpse of a pig, Sau Ying and Leung are both 
   surprised. Or are they? When Sau Ying dies of her illness (helped, in 
   part, by being scared to death by an oozing corpse hovering over her 
   bed), it is revealed that Yeung is very much alive and was working in 
   concert with Leung to hasten Sau Ying's death (it turns out that Sau 
   Ying was hording a treasure trove of jade and priceless jewelry). As 
   we have learned in many Hong Kong horror films, being dead is not an 
   excuse not to return from the grave to get even with those who have 
   wronged you and Sau Ying is no exception. Her retribution against 
   illicit lovers Leung and Yeung will be deadly as well as hugely 
   entertaining.&nbsp; This twisted variation of the classic French 
   mystery <B><A HREF="diaboliques_1955.htm">LES DIABOLIQUES</A></B> 
   (1955) proved to be so popular with Hong Kong audiences that two 
   official sequels were made, <B><A HREF="hex_1980_and_the_sequels.htm">HEX

    AFTER HEX</A></B> (1982), both also directed by Kuei Chih-Hung, as 
   well as many unofficial ones. While the first 35 minutes are rather 
   tame, taking time to set up the phony murder and deception, the 
   remainder of the film is a goofy delight (screenplay by the director 
   and Tan Chin-Hua), as the tone suddenly shifts from dead serious to 
   outright lunacy. Workers at the mansion piss their pants (one guy 
   dispenses so much pee, it's insane!); Sau Ying appears as a vampire 
   (one worker notices she doesn't cast a reflection in a mirror and is 
   then chased around the mansion by someone wearing a white horror mask 
   that spews large amounts of blood from its mouth!); skinned frogs and 
   snakes appear out of nowhere; Sau Ying chases her husband around the 
   house with a meat cleaver; Yeung beats a nosy local traveling 
   merchant to death with his cane, only to discover that he is still 
   alive when he tries to bury him (which leads to a funny and 
   suspenseful chase with a bloody denouement); Sau Ying's disembodied 
   head scares the shit out of a monk, who is nearly strangled by Sau 
   Ying's severed arm; some surprising full-frontal nudity when Leung 
   hires a female wizard to rid her of Sau Ying's ghost (which involves 
   nude body painting and ear-rippings); and lots of other gory 
   goodness. The finale is as ridiculous as they come (think twins), but 
   it just adds to the film's over-the-top charms. If you are a fan of 
   Hong Kong weirdness (and if you're not, you should be!), add this 
   film to your must-see list. Also starring Han Kuo-Tsai and Yu

   snap Tiffany out of her hypnotic state he is arrested and forced to 
   leave the bench. His replacement, Judge Jackson (the late Thalmus 
   Rasulala), is a child-hating judge who thinks all kids who commit 
   crimes should be tried as adults. This leads to a head to head 
   confrontation between him and Judge Walker, who thinks kids are a 
   product of their environment and can be changed if taken away from 
   that environment and placed in a loving home. Chelsea is also under

   the night before, asks the courtroom if anyone has any Pepto Bismol. 
   He is offered Tums, Rolaids and Alka Seltzer but refuses them all 
   saying, &quot;What kind of courtroom is this?&quot; This happens 
   right after he sentences a child (who kills Gould with a stun gun 
   after he observes him raping an underage girl in his charge) to stand 
   trial as an adult. Black (in what amounts to a cameo role) returns to 
   the courtroom after her hypnotic trauma dancing to &quot;Mary Had A 
   Little Lamb&quot;, slits her wrists and starts shooting up Judge 
   Walker's courtroom with an Uzi. Gun violence is very prominent in 
   this film. A girl, who douses herself and her newborn baby with 
   gasoline, is shot in the head. A child is shotgunned. People are 
   blown away for no reason. This is an uneasy film that would have 
   worked better if the comedy elements were eliminated. Unlike most 
   badfilms, the humor here is intentional making it a tough film to 
   judge. Also starring Ed Lauter as a trigger-happy cop who gets what

   (1973) -</B> Here's a very interesting and unique premise: When their 
   apartment building is condemned, a group of elderly tenants band 
   together and begin killing all those they deem responsible for their 
   situation (The poster art tagline reads: &quot;A murder a day keeps 
   the landlord away!&quot;). At first, the silver-haired old fogies 
   sabotage a highrise construction site down the street, messing with a 
   cable that<A HREF="homebodies_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/homebodies vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="287" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   hauls steel girders, which snaps, killing a construction worker who 
   was riding a girder to the top (One worker says, &quot;Call an 
   ambulance!&quot; to which another replies after seeing the body, 
   &quot;Why bother?&quot;). The octogenarians hope that accident will 
   delay their eviction, but when it doesn't, they get more creative. 
   When the callous Miss Pollack (Linda Marsh) shows up with eviction 
   notices for everyone and expects then to vacate the premises 
   immediately, the tenants, led by blind Mr. Blakely (Peter Brocco; <B><A HREF="twilight_zone_the_movie_1982.htm">TWILIGHT
    ZONE: THE MOVIE</A></B> - 1983) and feisty, prune-eating Mattie 
   (Paula Trueman, who is probably best known as the no-nonsense Grandma 
   Smith in Clint Eastwood's <B><A HREF="outlaw_josey_wales_1976.htm">THE
    OUTLAW JOSEY WALES</A></B> - 1976), make sure she knows in no 
   uncertain terms that they are never leaving. Miss Pollack retaliates 
   by turning off everyone's electric, gas and water, so the tenants 
   fight back, first sabotaging the construction site's elevator, which 
   kills three more construction workers. It forces the site to close 
   down, which pisses-off the site's owner, Mr. Crawford (Douglas 
   Fowley; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BlackOakConspiracy">BLACK OAK CONSPIRACY</A></B> 
   - 1977), who is also the new owner of the tenement building. When Mr. 
   Crawford spots the elderly Mr. Loomis (Ian Wolfe; <B><A HREF="thx_1138_1971.htm">THX
    1138</A></B> - 1971) giving the tenement building a new coat of 
   paint, he sends Miss Pollack with the police to forcibly remove the 
   old farts to their new digs: a colorless, lifeless retirement home. 
   Miss Pollack notices that not all the tenants made the move, so she 
   returns to the tenement building later that day and gets a butcher 
   knife rammed into her stomach by Miss Emily (Frances Fuller), a 
   slightly senile old woman whose father originally owned the building 
   (Miss Emily repeatedly talks to an urn containing her father's ashes 
   as if he were still alive). After getting rid of Miss Pollack's body 
   (they push her down the street in a wheelchair and dump her body over 
   a bridge into the coal car of a passing train), the geriatric set 
   concentrate their attention towards Mr. Crawford, whom they capture 
   and encase in a block of wet cement that is used as one of the 
   foundation pilings of his highrise building. Alas, all this hard and 
   dirty work does nothing to solve their problems, as another bigwig 
   takes Mr. Crawford's place and pretty soon Mattie begins killing her 
   elderly friends to keep them from talking to the police. It seems 
   that even at a ripe old age, people can lose their moral compass and 
   begin killing for self-serving reas<A HREF="homebodies_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/homebodies poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ons.&nbsp;
    This biting black comedy, directed/co-written by Larry Yust (<B><A HREF="trick_baby_1973.htm">TRICK
    BABY</A></B> - 1973), has much to recommend. First and foremost, the 
   cast of veteran old timers (which also includes Ruth McDevitt and 
   William Hansen), pull off the seemingly impossible task of making 
   their characters sympathetic and downright deadly at the same time. 
   Particularly effective is Paula Trueman as Mattie. The sequence where 
   she has to get rid of Miss Pollack's car is a thing of beauty. She 
   hasn't been behind the wheel of a car in over forty years and as she 
   haphazardly drives the car, nearly hitting a young boy (who sticks 
   his tongue out at her) and getting into several accidents, you can 
   see the wonder in her eyes as she views sections of Cincinnati, Ohio 
   (where this was filmed) that she hasn't seen in nearly half a 
   century. The emotions she conveys with just her eyes says more than 
   ten pages of dialogue ever could. Since this film was made in the 
   70's, don't let it's PG rating deter you. There are several grisly 
   scenes, including Miss Pollack's stabbing (not only do you see the 
   knife entering her stomach and the blade exiting out her back, you 
   also see a close-up of Mattie pulling the knife out) and Mr. Loomis 
   chopping off the toes of Mr. Crawford's foot when he finds his shoe 
   sticking out of the concrete foundation (That is the scene I best 
   remember when watching this on TV in the mid-70's). While there are a 
   few funny deaths (the wrecking ball crushing a man taking a shit in a 
   Porta-Potty being one of them), <B><A HREF="homebodies_1973b.htm">HOMEBODIES</A></B> 
   takes a deadly serious tone in the finale when Mattie begins killing 
   her oldest and dearest friends, which forces Mr. Blakely, Mr. Loomis 
   and Miss Emily to deal with her on her own terms. The sight of three 
   elderly people chasing Mattie in paddleboats in a park lake sounds 
   comical, but I assure you it's anything but. The film concludes on a 
   totally satisfying note that's surprising as well as goosebump-inducing.
    I won't spoil it for you here. This is an unsung classic from the 
   70's that is must viewing for fans of macabre cinema. Director Yust 
   only directed one other feature after this, the screwball comedy <A HREF="say_yes_1986.htm"><B>SAY

   unusual films, many of them unclassifiable. This is one of those 
   films. Even though it is weird beyond belief, it is also a highly 
   enjoyable film, full of mystery, suspense and humor, with a dollop of 
   bloody gore that should satisfy horror fans and those addicted to 
   unusual films. But this is not a horror film, in fact, I'm not sure 
   what genre this film belongs in, but I know what I like<A HREF="house_with_laughing_windows_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/house with laughing windows poster4b small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="253" HEIGHT="310" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   and this film hits my sweet spot. I'm not really sure how it did 
   that, but if a film makes me think long after it is over, it must be special.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The film opens with a tied-up naked man being stabbed over and over 
   with a knife while we hear a man whispering, <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;My
    colors...my colors...They run hot in my veins...So soft, my 
   colors...My colors are soft, like Autumn. They are like fresh 
   blood...They are smooth, like syphilis. And they...they get into 
   people's eyes, contaminating everyone. My colors. They flow through 
   my veins. My Lord and they get far...far away. Yes they go far. One 
   must die for them. Oh my Lord. I must purge myself, get them out. 
   Out...Purity. These are my colors. All my colors. Son of a bitch. 
   Here we come my Lord. I feel death coming. He's dying. I need purity. 
   I need to be pure. Keep him still.&quot;</FONT></B> Then the tied-up 
   man dies. You may think these are the words of a madman and you would 
   be correct, but by the time this film is over, those words will make 
   perfect sense.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see Stefano (Lino Capolicchio; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BloodstainShadow78">THE
    BLOODSTAINED SHADOW</A></B> - 1978) taking a ferry to a very small 
   village on a very small island. He is met at the drop-off point (the 
   island is so small, it doesn't have a dock) by the diminutive Mayor 
   Solmi (Bob Tonelli; <B><A HREF="zeder_revenge_of_the_dead_1983.htm">ZEDER</A></B> 
   - 1983) and his driver, Coppola (co-writer Gianni Cavina; <B><A HREF="cream_horn_1981.htm">CREAM
    HORN</A></B> - 1981), who is the village drunk. Stefano is on the 
   island to restore a church fresco of the martyr Saint Sebastian, 
   painted by an artist named Buono Legnani. Mayor Solmi tells Stefano 
   that Legnani died twenty years ago and he never finished the fresco. 
   The Mayor hopes the restored fresco will attract tourists, the 
   lifeblood of this small island during tourist season. It seems 
   Legnani had a reputation of being a madman, something Stefano will 
   become all too aware of as he works restoring the fresco. Also new to 
   the island is the pretty Francesca (Francesca Marciano; a co-writer 
   of the excellent Italian thriller <B><A HREF="im_not_scared_2003.htm">I'M
    NOT SCARED</A></B> - 2003), who was on the same ferry as Stefano. 
   They shared some knowing glances at each, even though they are 
   complete strangers. Their lives will become inextricably entwined in 
   the days to come.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Stefano discovers from the church's only priest, Don Orsi (Eugene 
   Walter; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#PyjamaGirlCase">THE PYJAMA 
   GIRL CASE</A></B> - 1977) that the church was once an SS hideout 
   during World War II. He shows Stefano the fresco, calling it 
   &quot;rubbish&quot;, but Stefano thinks that a great artist painted 
   it because, &quot;Only a great artist could portray death so 
   accurately.&quot; The fresco shows Saint Sebastian with his hands 
   tied behind his back, several daggers impaling his body, blood 
   dripping from the wounds, as two woman stand next to him, 
   laughing.&nbsp; Don Orsi tells Stefano not to be overly enthusiastic 
   about restoring the fresco and not to expect gratitude from anyone on 
   the island, because he could wait forever for that to happen and it 
   still won't. He also calls Legnani &quot;mad&quot;, not elaborating 
   why as he walks out of the church, telling Stefano that he hasn't had 
   breakfast yet.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Stefano gets a room at the island's only hotel and the first day he 
   is there, he gets a phone call. The person on the other end says, 
   &quot;You must go away. He doesn't love you...Don't touch that 
   painting!&quot; and then hangs up. This won't be the last time 
   Stefano hears that warning. Or is it a threat? One of Stefano's 
   neighbors at the hotel is a female teacher (Vanna Busoni; <B><A HREF="#SpiderLabyrinth1988">THE
    SPIDER LABYRINTH</A></B> - 1978) who sits down next to him at the 
   island's only restaurant. Stefano's professor and friend, Antonio 
   Mazza (Giulio Pizzirani; <B><A HREF="balsamus_man_of_satan_1970.htm">BALSAMUS,
    MAN OF SATAN</A></B> - 1970), pushes the teacher away from the table 
   and tells Stefano that she's a whore and the school she is teaching 
   at is about to fire her. We also learn that Stefano recently suffered 
   a nervous breakdown, so Antonio got him the job of restoring the 
   fresco, thinking it was good for his mental health. Antonio asks 
   Stefano if he saw the fresco yet and he answers yes. Antonio says it 
   would have been better if he saw it for the first time with him, 
   saying not to discuss it with anyone else because he's discovered the 
   most incredible story about the fresco, which is why he made sure 
   Stefano did the restoration. Antonio doesn't elaborate, because when 
   an elderly restaurant patron shoots Antonio a dirty look, he gets 
   nervous, telling Stefano he has to leave (The teacher yells to 
   Stefano, &quot;Don't worry, he'll take a couple of pills and feel 
   better!&quot;). What is this &quot;incredible story&quot; and why 
   does Antonio think this restoration job was perfect for Stefano?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Stefano and the teacher become fast friends and soon become lovers. 
   She tells Stefano that if he ever gets lonely, he knows where she 
   lives, but not in the morning, that's when she is teaching the kids 
   (What she is teaching them she doesn't say). Antonio then tells 
   Stefano that if he wants to understand why he thought this job was 
   perfect for him, he needs to take him somewhere, saying it is a house 
   with &quot;laughing&quot; windows and he'll take him there tomorrow 
   (The moment someone says &quot;tomorrow&quot; in a conversation in a 
   film like this, I begin to worry because tomorrow never comes!). 
   Antonio asks Stefano if he knows what &quot;they&quot; use to call 
   Legnani and Stefano says no. &quot;The Painter of the Agonies&quot;, 
   replies Antonio. &quot;Imagine when they started to run out of dead 
   people...&quot; explains Antonio, but before he can explain any 
   further, a man on a boat hands Antonio a bottle of murky green water. 
   Then Mayor Solmi appears and Antonio tells him that if he is hoping 
   to catch eels in this river, he's out of luck because there is more 
   war surplus materials polluting the river than there is in CRU 
   storage (Apparently, Antonio is on the island as an ecologist, 
   testing the waters for pollutants). Stefano cuts their conversation 
   short, telling Antonio that he has to get back to work and that he 
   will see him later (&quot;Later&quot; is also a word that sets off a 
   red flag in my mind). Solmi walks back to the church with Stefano, 
   telling him that Antonio would be a nice man if he didn't have such 
   strange ideas in his head.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While Stefano is restoring the fresco, church employee Lidio (Pietro 
   Brambilla), who acts slightly retarded (laughing all the time), tells 
   him about an &quot;idiot&quot; who liked to play phone pranks. His 
   name was Zanotti and he would phone young women at night and tell 
   them that he had made them pregnant. He was arrested and tried for 
   his crimes. He then warns Stefano to stop making prank phone calls, 
   telling him he better give up because he will never manage it. 
   Stefano has no idea what he is talking about (either do we) and asks 
   Lidio who keeps leaving fresh flowers under the fresco, but he 
   doesn't answer. At the restaurant, Stefano sees the Police Marshal 
   (Fernando Orlandi; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Macabre1980">MACABRE</A></B> 
   - 1980) manhandling Coppola, who is drunk. Coppola yells out, 
   &quot;Don't break my balls! You know if I talk...You know if I wanted 
   to...Do you know it or what?&quot; An older gentleman walks up to 
   Coppola and says, &quot;Stop it now, do you understand? Once and for 
   all, you're going to stop it. You know what I mean. Go home now!&quot;
    and Coppola exits the restaurant (after asking him for a 
   cigarette!). The older gentleman introduces himself to Stefano as Mr. 
   Poppi (Andrea Matteuzzi), the restaurant owner, and apologizes for 
   the ruckus, telling Stefano everyone in the village knows he is 
   restoring the fresco. Small villages like this know everyone's 
   business. He tells Stefano that ever since Solmi came to the village 
   and declared himself the mayor, the village began to change for the 
   better. He hopes that brings good fortune to the village, especially 
   after what that &quot;bad&quot; painter Legnani did to the village. 
   Stefano begins to notice all the grotesque painting that deal with 
   death that adorn the walls of the restaurant, which is not such a 
   good subject to go along with good food. He also notices that they 
   are strikingly similar to the fresco. Could Legnani have also painted 
   them? If they were, why are they hanging on the walls of the 
   village's only restaurant when no one in the village has a nice word 
   to say about him?&nbsp; Normally I would let you discover the reason 
   why, but I couldn't finish this review unless I tell you. Legnani was 
   a &quot;snuff&quot; painter, that is he would only paint people as 
   they were dying. When he couldn't find any people who were dying, he 
   had another method for painting dead people, something I will let you 
   discover for yourself. What I also won't tell you is why the 
   villagers hate Legnani, but his paintings adorn nearly every business 
   and home in the village. Sharp readers may read between the lines of 
   this review to come up with the answer, but Avati is a savvy 
   filmmaker, dropping subtle clues as the film progresses and I haven't 
   even gotten to the house of the title yet, so here are more clues to 
   make you understand what is going on:</FONT></FONT></P>

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B>1.</B>Mr.
    Poppi tells Stefano that the paintings hanging in the restaurant are 
   by Legnani, but they belong to his wife (Flavia Giorgi) and she would 
   rather die than give them up. Stefano has seen Mrs. Poppi several 
   times and she may be the one leaving fresh flowers under the fresco 
   every day. Stefano notices one painting hanging on the restaurant 
   wall that doesn't depict death, it depicts a nude female lying on a 
   couch. Mr. Poppi tells Stefano that it is a self-portrait of Legnani 
   (who couldn't get any women to pose for him, so he turned himself 
   into one butt-ugly woman!), the last painting he did before he 
   switched over to his &quot;Agonies&quot; period. It was the first 
   painting Legnani gave to Mrs. Poppi, but he was already quite mad 
   when he painted it because his body was infected with syphilis! 
   Antonio then phones Stefano at the restaurant, telling him to come 
   over immediately, he's discovered something quite &quot;horrible.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

    as I thought, when Stefano walks up to Antonio's apartment building, 
   he sees Antonio fall to his death from his third floor terrace. The 
   Mayor and Police Marshal classify Antonio's death as a suicide, even 
   though Stefano tells them he saw a shadow figure behind Antonio's 
   curtains as he fell to his death. The Police Marshal tells Stefano 
   that Antonio only had one enemy...himself, not bothering to explain 
   what he meant by that.</FONT></FONT></P>

   elderly paraplegic woman (Pina Barione) lives upstairs and that Lidio 
   is supposed to be taking care of her, but what Stefano doesn't know

   room, looking strikingly similar to the fresco he is restoring. (He 
   also discovers that the hotel owner lied to him. There is no busload

   why, which is like some disease in this village!), but he heard the

    This is simply a haunting movie about a village holding deadly 
   secrets. Director Pupi Avati, working with a screenplay co-written by 
   himself, his brother Antonio Avati (who produced many of Avati's 
   films), Gianni Cavina (who co-stars as Coppola) and Maurizio Costanza (<B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Zeder1983">ZEDER</A></B> 
   - 1983), fills the film with stunning visuals, every scene looks like 
   one of Legnani's paintings. The journey of discovery as to why 
   Legnani's paintings are displayed throughout the village even though 
   no one has a single nice word to say about him, is a journey well 
   worth the trip. It is something you won't forget for a long, long 
   time. It's like a vivid fever dream and that's a recommendation, 
   nothing negative implied. Even though people in town refuse to 
   elaborate on their feelings, this film doesn't. It a trip well worth 
   your time. If you like your films weird, yet understandable, this is 
   the one you should locate. It's quite unlike anything you have ever 
   seen before, but you won't regret watching it. Yes, it is that good.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   (1997) -</B> In 1997, surrealist Dutch director Rene Daalder shot two 
   films back-to-back. The first one was the widely distributed and 
   wonderfully unique sci-fi/horror comedy <B><A HREF="habitat_1997.htm">HABITAT</A></B>,
    which was released on both VHS &amp; DVD, as well as having many TV

   home video until boutique label Cult Epics picked it up for 
   distribution on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray in 2014. This was one of my most 
   anticipated releases for nearly 20 years and I'm glad to report it 
   was worth the wait. I don't know the real story of why this film was 
   held off for so long (from rumors that it was unfinished to rumors 
   that the processing lab was holding the film until their bill was 
   paid), but Daalder is best known for directing the cult film <B><A HREF="massacre_at_central_high_1976.htm">MASSACRE

   two films in one year is quite the feat for Daalder. I remember

   no news; nothing but rumors. It is also the final live action feature 
   for actor Patrick McGoohan; (<B><A HREF="scanners_1981.htm">SCANNERS</A></B>

   called out of retirement in 2002 to voice an animated film before 
   passing away early in 2009. This film contains some of Rene Daalder's 
   best dialogue and the plot is about as &quot;out there&quot; as a 
   film can get. Daalder has a really unique world-view and this film 
   showcases it to great effect. The film opens in typical delirious 
   Daalder fashion, where Dr. Dan Wyatt (Mark Bromilow) comes bursting 
   through a door in an insane asylum, holding his neck, while Dr. 
   Harvey Langston (McGoohan, with unkempt white hair) and his 
   wheelchair-bound assistant Myrna Malloy (Amanda Plummer; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Satans Little Help">SATAN'S
    LITTLE HELPER</A></B> - 2004) yell at the retreating doctor 
   &quot;Run, little rabbit, run!&quot; and &quot;Everyone is with him 
   and all eyes are upon him!&quot; as if there is no escape. We watch 
   the manic Dr. Wyatt run outside (while he imagines a crowd of mental 
   patients chasing him) and takes off in his car, but a short way down 
   the road his left arm and right arm act like they belong to different 
   people. He hears, &quot;You are not alone!&quot; while his right hand 
   tries to drive the car off the road. like it is possessed by someone 
   else. While his left hand tries to take control of the car, he also 
   hears, &quot;All for one and one for all&quot; (it will make sense 
   shortly) and the right hand wins, almost causing a head-on collision 
   and making the car to flip over. While hanging upside down, Dr. 
   Wyatt's hands battle over a Zippo lighter while gasoline flows into 
   the car. Again, the right hand wins, as the lighter is flicked and 
   the car explodes. What caused a well-respected psychiatrist to go so 
   insane? The police determine that is was due to Dr. Wyatt being 
   drunk, but fellow colleague and friend Dr. Samuel Fry (Michael 
   Maloney; <B><A HREF="luna_2014.htm">LUNA</A></B> - 2014) doesn't buy 
   it, telling his soon-to-be ex-boss Dr Andrew Miller (David Francis) 
   that his dead friend despised Dr. Langston and once called him a 
   &quot;mad scientist&quot; for the methods he uses on his patients 
   (Dr. Miller says this about Dr. Langston: &quot;A renegade 
   psychiatrist forming a mysterious cult, sequestered away in a hidden 
   mountain retreat. How romantic!&quot;). The clinic that Dr. Fry is 
   now working at is closing and Dr. Miller wants him to become a 
   colleague at &quot;The Brain Spa&quot;, a new psychiatric treatment 
   center financed by Bob Biccardo (Louis De Bianco; the end credits 
   lists his last name as &quot;Corrado&quot;, but everyone is clearly 
   saying &quot;Biccardo&quot;), but Dr. Fry believes the new techniques 
   that are going to be used at The Brain Spa are just a fad and may be 
   dangerous for the patients (Dr. Miller replies, &quot;It's big in 
   Japan!&quot;). Mr. Biccardo asks the Oxford-trained Dr. Fry why he 
   left England (Biccardo tells Fry that he attended Oxford for one 
   semester and calls himself a &quot;summa cum fuck-up&quot;) for the 
   States and Dr. Fry says, &quot;The truth is, Mr. Biccardo, there are 
   a lot more mental patients in America&quot;, which infuriates Dr. 
   Miller since Mr. Biccardo is his cash cow. Dr. Fry has scruples and 
   believes that every patient deserves the same level of care no matter 
   what is in their bank account and tells Dr. Miller that he is going 
   to work at a free clinic, but Dr. Miller and Mr. Biccardo have more 
   nefarious plans for him. Dr. Miller tells Fry that his patient, 
   Veronica Bloom (Emmanuelle Vaugier; <B><A HREF="saw_2_2005.htm">SAW II</A></B> 
   - 2005), is being freed (Dr. Miller sarcastically says, &quot;And 
   free yourself in the process!&quot;), but Dr. Fry doesn't believe she 
   is ready. The clinic has already been emptied of most patients, who 
   are sent to live with their families and when Veronica asks Dr. Fry 
   why no one has come for her, he reminds her of the 
   &quot;incident&quot; which sent her here. Veronica pitches a fit and 
   says that she will let the voices in her head destroy her unless she 
   can go with Dr. Fry. Dr. Fry decides to take her to Dr. Langston's 
   clinic, but first he takes her to a picnic at the beach to see how 
   she reacts to being out on her own. It ends badly when Veronica has 
   some ants crawl on her and she strips topless and jumps in the water. 
   Dr. Fry jumps in after her, but she tries to stab Dr. Fry with a 
   corkscrew, forcing him to sedate her with a drug in a hypodermic 
   needle. They drive to Dr. Langston's clinic and are greeted by 
   wheelchair-bound Myrna, as an orderly takes a still-unconscious 
   Veronica to her room. This is exactly what Dr. Miller and Mr. 
   Biccardo wanted to happen, since Biccardo's son Bobby (Joseph Wynne), 
   a bad stutterer, is a patient at the clinic and Dr. Langston refuses 
   to release him to his family. Veronica was the perfect pawn (Chess 
   does play an important part in this film) to set their plan in motion 
   on getting him released. After noticing that the clinic is badly 
   underlit (Myrna says that Dr. Langston purposely keeps the clinic 
   dark because he believes &quot;Sickness is like a mushroom. Shine too 
   much light on it and it retreats into the woodwork.&quot;), Dr. Fry 
   meets the obviously demented Dr. Langston, who shows him a collection 
   of his patients. It seems that he has surgically inserted electronic 
   transmitters behind their left ears in hope of creating one universal 
   consciousness, or as Langston calls it, a &quot;group mind&quot;, 
   since he believes religion, normal therapy and drugs are useless. 
   That night, Dr. Fry decides to investigate the asylum on his own 
   (there are no bars on the windows and the front door has no locks), 
   where someone behind one of the doors says, &quot;I know you are out 
   there. I can smell you!&quot;, a nymphomaniac bares her breasts to 
   him, Myrna is forcing butch patient Blair (Joanne Vannicola) to dance 
   around in a tutu and he sees Veronica being wheeled into an operating 
   room, where Dr. Langston inserts an electronic transmitter behind her 
   ear. Dr. Fry cannot stop him because a patient speaking gibberish is 
   performing martial arts moves in front of the operating room door. 
   When Blair (who speaks in rhyme or swears like a truck driver) tries 
   to rape Dr. Fry in his room, he is saved by Dr. Langston, who 
   recommends that he locks his door every night. Dr. Fry meets Veronica 
   the next day and she seems like a changed woman. He also meets Bobby 
   for the first time at Langston's insistence, since he believes Fry 
   was sent here to take Bobby away. Fry assures Langston that he has no 
   idea what he is talking about. Dr. Fry then watches one of the 
   strangest group therapy sessions ever committed to film, as Langston 
   plays the bongos and all the patients (including Veronica) dance 
   around the room. When Dr. Fry tries to stop the session and is forced 
   to punch one of the male patients in the face, he discovers that all 
   the other patients feel the same pain, as if he punched them all in 
   the face, too. Langston sedates Dr. Fry and implants a transmitter 
   behind his left ear. He wants Dr. Fry to experience what all his 
   other patients do and if he still wants to leave in 24 hours, 
   Langston will remove the transmitter and gladly let him leave. Myrna 
   holds her nightly &quot;dance therapy&quot; session, where Dr Fry, 
   for the first time, discovers that he can dance fantastically with 
   Veronica as his dance partner. That night, Dr. Fry and Veronica make 
   love and we see all the patients feel the same erotic desires (Myrna 
   talks throughout the whole act) and they all climax at the same time 
   (The whole scene is as surreal as a film can get). It seems that Dr. 
   Langston has truly created a &quot;group mind&quot;, where everyone 
   feels the same desires and emotions in equal measure. Langston's hope 
   is to make the entire world a better place to live using his 
   technique. Things go horribly wrong when Mr. &amp; Mrs. Biccardo and 
   Dr. Miller show up at the asylum and Mr. Biccardo demands that his 
   son be returned to him since his stuttering hasn't gotten any better 
   (Biccardo has also been financing this asylum!). Dr. Langston refuses 
   and all the patients begin to stutter, while Dr. Fry strangles Dr. 
   Miller and the rest of the inmates surround Mr. &amp; Mrs. Biccardo. 
   Dr. Fry discovers that it is Myrna, not Dr. Langston, who is the 
   driving force behind this asylum (We watch as Myrna gets up out of 
   her wheelchair dressed in a gold leotard and does the strangest 
   interpretive dance your eyes can bear!), so Dr. Fry grabs Veronica 
   and tries to escape the asylum (There's a funny scene where Fry kicks 
   one of the inmates in his balls and all the other inmates, including 
   the female ones, grab their crotches in pain). After some kung fu 
   fighting between Dr. Fry and Blair (the martial artist who speak 
   gibberish shares his knowledge with Myrna), the couple escape in his 
   car and drive to the nearest police station. While Veronica sits in 
   the car unresponsive (Myrna tries to take over her body, but she is 
   too far away), Dr. Fry discovers that Sheriff Grierson (Lorne Brass) 
   is working in cahoots with Dr. Langston when he sees a chessboard 
   with the pieces in the same <A HREF="hysteria_1997.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hysteria 1997 blu-ray front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="226" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>position
    as the one in Dr. Langston's office (they are playing the game by 
   phone). When Dr. Fry is unable to wake up Veronica, he has no choice 
   but to return to the asylum, where he makes a horrible discovery: 
   When he originally brought Veronica to the asylum, she was brain dead 
   and in a coma thanks to an allergic reaction to the sedative he 
   injected into her when she tried to kill him with the corkscrew. The 
   only way she is able to survive is to stay at the asylum and use the 
   &quot;group mind&quot; technique. It is also made clear that when he 
   was making love to Veronica, he was actually making love to Myrna, 
   who used Veronica as her puppet. Dr. Langston ends up dead when Dr. 
   Fry pushes Myrna and her wheelchair down the stairs and the 
   wheelchair strikes him in the head. A series of events happen when 
   the Sheriff discovers Dr. Miller's dead body in the trunk of Dr. 
   Fry's car, but when he enters the asylum all the patients explain to 
   him what happened in verse, even Mr. &amp; Mrs. Biccardo, who were 
   not killed but had the transmitters implanted in their heads 
   (therefore letting them spend all the time they want with their son). 
   They blame both the deaths of Dr. Miller and Dr. Langston as the 
   result of an argument they had with each other. The next thing we see 
   is that Dr. Fry has taken over the asylum (this way he can be with 
   Veronica forever, even though he knows that Myrna will be pulling her 
   strings) as a line of taxis are at the asylum taking some of the 
   patients away to the free world in hopes that &quot;group mind&quot; 
   will infect the rest of the world. We then see a martial arts school, 
   where every student has an incision behind their left ears. Maybe Dr. 
   Langston wasn't so mad after all?&nbsp; This is a weird and wonderful 
   film that contains some excellent performances, especially by Patrick 
   McGoohan and Amanda Plummer, who deliver some of Rene Daalder's 
   dialogue with aplomb. (Example: &quot;You can't run. It's like trying 
   to hide from your shadow.&quot;). There's also plenty of nudity and 
   foul language, but no blood or gore, because the terror here is of 
   the psychological kind and you won't miss the red stuff one bit. The 
   whole film looks like it was photographed a little off-kilter, as if 
   to make us feel the same way the patients do in the asylum. Daalder 
   proves he is great at dialogue and fills the film with black humor, 
   such as when Myrna tells Dr. Fry, &quot;I won't stand for this!&quot; 
   and Dr. Fry replies, &quot;Oh, you won't stand for anything!&quot;. 
   The only negative about the film is that the print Cult Epics uses 
   for the DVD &amp; Blu-Ray is sometimes scratchy (especially the 
   sequence where Dr. Fry enters the police station), but my guess it 
   was the best they could find since this is listed on the cover as the 
   &quot;Director's Cut&quot;. Still, this film is an amazing find and 
   worth your time and effort to make part of your film library. Rene 
   Daalder is one of the most unsung filmmakers of the past 40 years and 
   this film is now one of my favorites. My highest recommendation. Also 
   starring Gregory Hlady, Ralph Allison, Sam Stone, Lynn Snelling, 
   Susan Glover, Rodrigue Proteau, Ren&eacute;-Madeleine Le Guerrier, 
   Ga&eacute;tan Gingras, Robert Higden and Jocelyne Zucco as Mrs. 
   Biccardo (who flashes her breasts at the Sheriff when he visits the 
   asylum). A <A HREF="http://www.cultepics.com">Cult Epics</A> Release. <B>Not

   films. It has a cast of seasoned pros familiar with the giallo genre, 
   a director known for making quality films spanning many genres and a 
   screenplay that touches on many of the ingredients that make giallo 
   flicks so appealing. So why did this film turn out so badly? What 
   went wrong here? Read on for my explanation. But first, a brief 
   rundown of the plot:</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After a street tour of the city of Dublin, Ireland (shown during the opening<A HREF="iguana_with_the_tongue_of_fire_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/iguana with the tongue of fire dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   credits), we are in the country home of some unknown woman, who is 
   home alone as night approaches. Only, what she doesn't know, she is 
   not alone, as we see someone in dark glasses and wearing black gloves 
   (what else?) is secretly watching her. When she tries to use the 
   phone, the woman discovers that the line has been cut and the 
   black-gloved stranger pulls one of the fuses out of the house's 
   fusebox, causing all the lights to go out. The woman tries to run 
   outside, only to be met at the front door by the stranger, who throws 
   acid in her face and then cuts her throat with a straight razor (yes, 
   it is overkill, but it is really graphic!). The next morning, a 
   chauffeur pulls up to the house, where the snooty Mrs. Sobiesky 
   (Valentina Cortese; <B><A HREF="evil_eye_1963.htm">THE EVIL EYE</A></B> 
   - 1963) hands him some packages and tells him to put them into the 
   boot (trunk) of the car. Her young son Bernard opens the trunk, 
   discovering the the body of the dead woman, wrapped in plastic. We 
   then discover that the house belongs to a Mr. Sobiesky (Anton 
   Diffring; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#SevenDeathsCatsEyes">SEVEN DEATHS 
   IN THE CAT'S EYE</A></B> - 1973), who is the Swedish Ambassador to 
   Ireland. Mrs. Sobiesky goes to call the police to report the murder, 
   but she is surprised to see her husband in the house, as she thought 
   he was away in Switzerland. The Ambassador pulls the phone out of her 
   hand and calls his embassy, telling them to send someone over 
   (telling his wife that this is &quot;consulate business&quot;). When 
   his wife asks what he is doing home, he tells that he decided to come 
   home early, but the look on his wife's face tells us a different 
   story. A doctor&nbsp; shows up to look at the dead body, the 
   Ambassador asking him if he is able to identify the woman. The doctor 
   tells him no, whomever killed her knew exactly what they were doing 
   (&quot;A specialist, I would say. Like me.&quot;, says the doctor 
   with a smirk on his face). Is it possible that the Ambassador knew 
   the dead woman?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Someone then mails police Inspector Lawrence (Arthur O'Sullivan) the 
   dead woman's passport, where he discovers she was from Holland. The 
   Inspector mentions to his assistant that before the Ambassador came 
   to Ireland, he was Ambassador to the Hague (a place in the 
   Netherlands that is the seat of the International Court of Justice). 
   His assistant wants to question the Ambassador, but the Inspector 
   says no, it will take a lot more evidence to question a man of his 
   stature and they will be lucky if he will let them question his 
   staff. His assistant wants to know how they should proceed with the 
   case, the Inspector saying, &quot;You'll find out.&quot; They drive 
   to the Ambassador's house and they watch as the Ambassador abuses his 
   butler, Mandel (Renato Romano; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#FrenchSexMurders">THE
    FRENCH SEX MURDERS</A></B> - 1972), over a simple thing as lighting 
   his cigar! The Inspector asks the Ambassador if he knew the woman and 
   he callously says, &quot;Which woman?&quot; The Inspector reminds him 
   about the dead woman found in the trunk of his car and asks again if 
   he knew her. Once again his answer is callous: &quot;After one glance 
   and, quite frankly, I didn't feel like taking a second one, the lady 
   seemed to me...utterly unrecognizable.&quot; He then mentions to the 
   Inspector that the murderer may be a woman and when the Inspector 
   asks him why he would think that, he says, &quot;Well, why not? It's 
   just a thought.&quot; The Ambassador even goes as far as to suggest 
   someone put her body in the trunk of his car to create a scandal, as 
   a person in his important position is ripe to be subjected to false 
   allegations, his not-so-subtle warning to the Inspector to back off, 
   but the Inspector is not falling for it. (Yes, the Ambassador is a 
   piece of work. He thinks that his position puts him above the law.). 
   The Inspector asks if he can question some of his staff and the 
   Ambassador says yes, but not at his house, take them to the police 
   station for questioning. The Inspector does just that, bringing the 
   staff to the station for some intense questioning. The chauffeur, who 
   wears dark glasses because he has conjunctivitis and his eyes are 
   sensitive to light, couldn't act more guilty if he tried, the 
   Inspector catching him in some lies and calling him on them. He 
   mentions to the Inspector that the Ambassador has just left the 
   country, but that, too, is a lie. Did the Ambassador tell the 
   chauffeur to lie to make him look guilty?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then discover that the Ambassador has a mistress (Dominique 
   Boschero; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WhoSawHerDie">WHO SAW HER DIE?</A></B> 
   - 1972), a singer in a nightclub who is blackmailing him. He shows up 
   in her dressing room, wearing a trenchcoat and dark glasses, telling 
   her that he is not going to pay her any more money. A short time 
   later, she is found dead in her dressing room. Also at the nightclub 
   are the Ambassador's daughter, Helen (Dagmar Lassander; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#ForbiddenPhotos1970">THE
    FORBIDDEN PHOTOS OF A LADY ABOVE SUSPICION</A></B> - 1970) and 
   ex-police detective John Norton (Luigi Pistilli; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#YourViceLockedRoom">YOUR
    VICE IS A LOCKED ROOM...</A></B> - 1972), a brutal cop with a 
   mysterious past. John offers Helen a ride home on his motorcycle and 
   she accepts, inviting him into her home (the Ambassador's house) and 
   they then make passionate love. It doesn't take a genius to realize 
   that the Inspector hired John to keep an eye on the Ambassador, his 
   family and staff, but the film tries (rather unconvincingly) to make 
   us believe he is there for another reason.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That is the problem with this whole film. It treats the audience 
   like mindless idiots and tries to force-feed us false evidence to 
   make us believe that every male and female character in this film is 
   the killer. The way it does it to the audience is what is so 
   insulting to our intelligence. Every time we see dark glasses or a 
   straight razor, even under the most innocent of circumstances, the 
   film stops in its tracks and the same sound effect is used as the 
   camera zooms onto the sunglasses or razor, much in the same way the 
   sound effects were used when Steve Austin used his bionic powers on <B><A HREF="six_million_dollar_man_tv_series.htm">THE

   times!). The way director/co-screenwriter Riccardo Freda (<B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Ghost1963">THE

   - 1981), here rightfully using the alias &quot;Willy Pareto&quot;, 
   films the male actors in this film, zooming in on their faces and 
   playing the same ominous music every time to show us their guilt, 
   panders to the audience's lowest common denominator, which is 
   insulting to those of us who would rather figure out who is guilty 
   and who is innocent based on the way the story progresses. That is 
   this film's biggest sin, but the backstory on some of the male 
   characters is also risible, especially John Norton's.&nbsp; The 
   reason why he is an ex-cop is that he murdered his wife's killer. A 
   flashback shows us how he did it, torturing the handcuffed killer in 
   a hotel room and then shooting him in the head, his brains 
   splattering against a wall. But it is not just the men who are 
   problematic, it's the women, too. Helen doffs her clothes after 
   knowing John for about an hour and Mrs. Sobiesky is also a detriment 
   to all females, as the Ambassador yells at her, &quot;Bitch! Bitch! 
   Bitch!&quot; when she threatens to spill the beans of his affairs to 
   the Inspector if he doesn't treat her son Bernard with the respect he 
   deserves (Truth is, Bernard is not his son!). The biggest groan came 
   from me during the finale, when John has the killer cornered and is 
   about to shoot, but he has his flashback again, showing us that he 
   didn't shoot his wife's murderer, the killer shot himself in the 
   head! I mean, how can you excuse that? This whole film plays like 
   some unintentional comedy, with really graphic violence (the blood 
   flows rather freely, especially <A HREF="iguana_with_the_tongue_of_fire_1971_foreign_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/iguana with the tongue of fire italy poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="217" HEIGHT="308" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>on
    the close-ups of slit throats) and bouts of explicit nudity (both 
   male and female). The red herrings are so obvious, it's comical and 
   the reveal of the real killer is a kick in the nuts to all real fans 
   of giallo films, as the person who did it was never integral to the 
   plot (and his image is all over the ads for the film!) Freda tries to 
   get our minds off the absurdities of the story (supposedly based on 
   author Richard Mann's novel &quot;A Room Without Door&quot;, but no 
   one has ever heard of the author or the novel!) by tossing in such 
   unusual sights&nbsp; as a bloody decapitated cat's head in John's 
   refrigerator (John still lives with his mother!), a bobsled accident 
   (!), a woman who tries to commit suicide by slicing her throat while 
   taking a bubble bath and a bunch of other things unrelated to the 
   convoluted plot (screenplay by Freda and Alessandro Continenza [<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Let Sleeping Corpse">LET
    SLEEPING CORPSES LIE</A></B> - 1974]). For a real laugh, you have to 
   listen to the Inspector's story about stepping on an iguana, which is 
   related to the film's title. It makes me want to re-evaluate Freda's 
   career, as I always though he was a director of good-to-great films. 
   I guess every director is entitled to one bad film, but nothing as 
   bad as this one is!</FONT></FONT><BR>

   release and, according to the IMDb: <B>&quot;When the German 
   Co-Producer Artur Brauner saw the finished film, he decided to skip a 
   theatrical release in Germany, just due to the quality of the film,

   he came to that conclusion. As a matter of fact, Germany didn't see 
   this film for nearly 40 years, until it was officially released there 
   on DVD. Since this film never saw an official VHS or disc release in 
   the United States, the only way to see it is via the DVD-R offered by <A HREF="http://www.sinistercinema.com">Sinister

   yellow in some scenes, but that has nothing to do with it being a 
   giallo film!), but it improves as the film progresses. It seems to be 
   uncut, but it is hard to tell considering that the film has basically 
   been unseen in the U.S. for years. It's bloody as hell, though. I 
   guess that is the best thing I can say about the film, but that is in

    THE FOLDS OF THE FLESH</A><A NAME="InFoldsFlesh"></A> (1970) -</B> 
   As escaped convict Pascal Gorriot (Fernando Sancho) is evading the 
   police, he spots Lucille (Eleonora Rossi Drago) disposing of her 
   dead, headless husband's body on the grounds of the castle she lives 
   in with her son Colin and step-daughter Falesse (We don't know how 
   the husband was killed, but we do see Mom and the kids standing over 
   the dead body, the head lying a few feet away from the torso). The 
   police surround the castle and capture Pascal (they almost catch 
   Lucille in the act of buring the body), yet he keeps his mouth shut 
   on what he just saw (including watching Lucille sending her husband's 
   motorboat driverless into the ocean, making it look like he 
   disappeared in a boating accident). Thirteen years pass and it's 
   plain to see that Lucille and her now-grown kids are one fucked-up 
   family. Besides Falesse (Pier Angeli, here billed as &quot;Anna Maria 
   Pierangeli&quot;) and Colin (Alfredo Majo) having a none-too-subtle 
   incestuous relationship, it's even obvious to the casual observer 
   that the entire family is psycho crazy. A family friend named Michele 
   visits the castle with his dog and they both lose their lives rather 
   quickly. The dog finds the grave of Daddy and begins digging it up, 
   so Colin strangles the dog with his bare hands. Michele tries to rob 
   Falesse of some jewelry, so she stabs him in the back with a dagger. 
   Lucille and Colin dispose of Miche<A HREF="in_the_folds_of_the_flesh_1970b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/in the folds of the flesh spanish poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="244" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>le's
    body with a nice acid bath. A friend of Michele's named Alex comes 
   to the castle the next day and ends up decapitated with a sword after 
   he removes Falesse's blonde wig while they are making love (A 
   flashback reveals that her father molested her often when she was a 
   child). We also learn that Falesse has a twin sister named Ester 
   (also played by Angeli), who is in an insane asylum in Zurich, 
   Switzerland. Pascal, who has just been released from prison, shows up 
   at the castle and blackmails the entire family. After making them dig 
   up the grave of their murdered husband/father and only finding the 
   corpse of Michele's dog, an angry Pascal holds the family at 
   gunpoint, rapes both Lucille and Falesse and makes Colin shine his 
   shoes. Pascal doesn't realize who he is dealing with, though, and 
   he's eventually murdered in a unique way while taking a bath. Things 
   take a really strange turn when someone claiming to be Lucille's late 
   husband shows up at the castle and we finally learn the truth of what 
   really happened on that day thirteen years earlier. There are quite a 
   few more twists and turns ahead, but you really have to pay close 
   attention if you want to keep up. As you'll soon find out, no one is 
   who they pretend to be, so you may want to keep a scorecard handy to 
   sort it out. Seriously, I'm not kidding!&nbsp; From the opening 
   minutes, where the first image we see is a decapitated corpse, a 
   spoken word (as well as on-screen) quote from Freud and a disjointed 
   timeframe that seems to have been done on purpose, you know that 
   you're in for something special. The film just gets weirder as it 
   progresses, as it tosses in incest, rape, a pair of vultures kept in 
   cages as pets, a truly distasteful Nazi flashback that results into 
   an even more amazing deadly bubblebath and trippy visuals and editing 
   techniques that come straight out of a 60's LSD film. Toss in 
   numerous decapitations, acid baths and a general sleazy tone and what 
   you get is a surreal familial dynamic that would make the Addams 
   Family quake in their boots. Director/co-scripter Sergio Bergonzelli (<B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#PigWorld1978">PIG'S

   characters up to the very end, only to dispose of them just as 
   quickly in gruesome ways and zig-zagging left when you think he's 
   going right. The finale is a bit too much, as it piles on 
   revelation-upon-revelation (This family has more secrets than Heinz 
   has varieties) until your head spins, but it's never boring and 
   contains some truly demented sequences as well as a surprising bit of 
   full-frontal female nudity, unusual for a film made in 1970. <B><A HREF="in_the_folds_of_the_flesh_1970b.htm">IN

   Mr. Peterson, who told them he found a crashed plane on the island

   Don't you believe it. Captain Jenkins gives an evil smile when he 
   sees the group walk into the mansion and radios-in that he will be 
   back at home base in 14 hours. The group find a note from Mr. 
   Peterson saying he was delayed and he will see them soon. The group 
   bicker among themselves, arguing whether Peterson actually has the 
   gold and decide to search the mansion for it. Since these people 
   don't trust each other, do you think if they found the gold that<A HREF="intruder_1975.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/intruder 1975 blu-ray front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="194" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   they would announce it? Don't count on it. A little bit later in the 
   film, Captain Jenkins makes it back to civilization, hops in his car 
   and drives to a lighthouse. He goes inside and walks up the spiral 
   staircase to the top, where someone with big hands and a very 
   muscular arm chokes Captain Jenkins and smashes his head through a 
   window. Later on the police find him floating in a fish storage tank. 
   At the same time Captain Jenkins is killed, De Carlo is found dead in 
   her bed with her throat punctured with two holes.. Mr. Alexander, the 
   mansion's butler is found in the same condition in the mansion's 
   elevator. We then see that the entire mansion is bugged and someone 
   is listening to everything that is being said. Another male member of 
   the group is found hanging upside down with his throat punctured. 
   Still another sweaty male member is approached by the killer (He 
   dangles his crucifix in front of him like the killer is a 
   vampire!)&nbsp; and he is choked and thrown out his bedroom window 
   (all we see are the killer's eyes and sharp people will know who it 
   is immediately). The sweaty dead man's body disappears from the 
   mansion's grounds so no one can see his body. Mr. Peterson (Ted 
   Cassidy; <A HREF="poor_pretty_eddie_1973.htm"><B>POOR PRETTY EDDIE</B></A> 
   - 1973) finally shows up, his face all bloody and he doesn't say a 
   word. One of the last two women in the group is attacked in her 
   bedroom when a huge arm smashes through her locked bedroom door (The 
   film's most effective scene) but he runs away when the male members 
   hear her screams and run to protect her (Robinson wildly fires a 
   pistol and then tells everyone he was never a good shot!). All the 
   group knows is that the killer has big feet! It doesn't take a rocket 
   scientist to figure this out, but one of the male members accuses the 
   obese Mr. Marsatti (De Sarro) of wearing oversized shoes to throw 
   everyone off! Mr. Peterson disappears again , so the remaining male 
   members of the group search the woods for him, where Marsatti watches 
   a member of the group drown in a lake and he smiles (Why?) The woman 
   who was attacked in her bedroom is drowned in the bathtub while 
   taking a bubble bath and the remaining two men accuse Marsatti for 
   her death. Marsatti proves quite proficient in the martial arts and 
   he and another male member get into a fight that leads from the 
   mansion to a shed full of bags of fertilizer. They both die when they 
   fall on the same pitchfork. Mr. Peterson and the last remaining woman 
   (Phyllis Robinson) turn out to be lovers and he confesses that he 
   killed no one. Meanwhile Robinson finds the sweaty man's body lying 
   on top of drums of gasoline and finds a fuse, if lit, would burn the 
   entire mansion down (This scene make no sense , except to show 
   someone discovers the sweaty man's body). Robinson discovers Peterson 
   kissing the woman and the chase is on. Peterson traps Robinson in the 
   kitchen, but he electrocutes Peterson with a trap he rigged and finds 
   that Peterson was carrying the lost gold in a vest he wore under his 
   shirt (No wonder he walked so slowly!). Robinson finds a boat and 
   takes the woman and the gold back to civilization. The woman finds a 
   knife and goes to stab Robinson in the back, but the boat hits a wave 
   and she falls out of the boat and drowns. The police inform Robinson 
   that Peterson had a twin brother (which is how Captain Jenkins and De 
   Carlo could be killed at the same time) and then we see Peterson's 
   twin brother with a high-powered rifle pointed at Robinson and the 
   boat. He fires and the film ends with a shot of Robinson's blood (it 
   looks like maple syrup! All the other blood in the film is bright 
   red.) splashing on the baat's steering dash. This proto-slasher film 
   never got theatrical distribution (Those expecting lots of blood will 
   be disappointed), but there is an excellent and funny 2008 interview

   funny moment, his cat can be heard meowing at his feet, so he picks

   (1989) -</B> If you are a fan of truly weird cinema, this is the film 
   for you. It's colorful, outlandish, funny, sexy, scary and, above 
   all, entertaining as hell. Overweight scientist Nathan Wingate 
   (co-scripter Harry S. Robbins) creates a machine in his laboratory 
   that allows him to view a parallel universe &quot;occupying the same 
   sub-atomic space as our universe&quot;. Nathan is constantly 
   interrupted in his lab by his nagging wife Nancy (Laura O'Malley), 
   who reminds him that guests are arriving for their son Sam's (Dan 
   Evans) birthday party. Teenager Sam spends most of his time fawning 
   over the image of Jasmine (Dru-Anne Cakmis) on his computer and on a 
   poster he keeps hidden in his closet, but he realizes that she is 
   just an image of a woman he will never meet (much like the teens and 
   their posters of Farrah Fawcett in the 70's). Sam helps his father 
   finish-up in the lab before the party starts and Nathan sends him to 
   Miskatonic University (!) to pick up a waveform amplifier because he 
   needs mor<A HREF="kamillions_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/kamillions poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>e
    power for his machine. As guests begin arriving for the party, 
   including Nathan's bitch-of-a-sister Angelica (Kate Alexander) and 
   rich cousin Count Desmon (Christopher Gasti), Nathan looks through 
   the portal to the parallel universe and spots several small creatures 
   scurrying about the landscape. After making a comment that looking 
   through the portal is like looking through &quot;a window to 
   Heaven&quot;, Nathan is painfully sucked through the portal ass-first 
   (like being sucked through a hole in a spaceship in outer space) and 
   the small, tentacled slug-like creatures, called Kamillions (a 
   take-off on the word &quot;chameleons&quot;), escape into our 
   universe and infest the Wingate mansion. One of the creatures 
   attaches itself to Desmon and duplicates him, while another creature 
   becomes trapped in Sam's bedroom and transforms itself into the image 
   of Jasmine. When Sam finds the naked Jasmine in his bedroom, he 
   thinks best friend Alex (Andrew Ross Litzky) hired a look-alike 
   stripper as a birthday present, yet Sam treats her with respect. The 
   alien Jasmine tells Sam to trust her and that she is looking for 
   someone, while the alien doppelganger Desmon entertains the party 
   guests with gravity-defying tricks, eventually making Angelica 
   believe her teacup is full of cockroaches and making the mouth of 
   ex-male escort-turned-reverend Larry Newman (David Allan Shaw) fill 
   with blue goo. The alien Jasmine confesses to Sam and Alex that she 
   came through the portal with another, more-dangerous alien and she 
   must capture him and both return to their world before the portal is 
   closed. Sam works with Jasmine to try and bring alien Desmon back to 
   the lab, but there are obstacles in their way (the main one being 
   that the alien Desmon is really nothing but a bratty ten year-old 
   alien child and the alien Jasmine is his babysitter!) before the two 
   aliens can return home and everything can return back to normal. 
   Well, as normal as the Wingate family can ever hope to be.&nbsp; This 
   low-budget unclassifiable film, sort of a cross between David 
   Cronenberg's <B><A HREF="fly_1986.htm">THE FLY</A></B> (1986) and 
   Stuart Gordon's <B><A HREF="from_beyond_1986.htm">FROM BEYOND</A></B> 
   (1986), with a healthy dose of intentional humor, is the kind of 
   flick that you will either love or hate, leaving very little middle 
   ground. Director/co-scripter Mike B. Anderson (listed here as 
   &quot;Mikel B. Anderson&quot;), who also gave us the bizarre comedy <B><A HREF="alone_in_the_t-shirt_zone_1986.htm">ALONE

   TV's <B><A HREF="simpsons_tv_series_&amp;_movie.htm">THE SIMPSONS</A></B>,
    offers many off-beat set pieces, including Reverend Larry's penis 
   turning into a snake-like alien (the film's alien effects are 
   decidedly low-rent, but somehow work within the film's confines), 
   which he chokes with both hands (I laughed hard) before it bites him 
   on the face. There are many more comical/horrific scenes, such as 
   when Angelica's fox stole comes to life; Desmon shoving a phone 
   receiver down the throat of Sam's abusive sister Linda (Allison 
   Rachel Golde); Desmon turning Angelica into a spider (it's a hoot, as 
   well as being creepy as hell); Desmon shoving Alex's entire body into 
   a tiny fishbowl (drowning him!); Desmon's attempted rape of maid Emma 
   (Lynn Applebaum); and many others. If you like your films as far 
   south of weird as humanly possible, then <B><A HREF="kamillions_1989.htm">KAMILLIONS</A></B>

    BY INCHES</A><A NAME="KillByInches"></A> (1999) -</B> Here's 
   something you don't see very often: An art house horror film. Thomas 
   Klamm (Emmanuel Salinger) works at his father's tailor shop, where 
   his father (Marcus Powell) is a cruel, domineering man, but a master 
   tailor. Unfortunately, Thomas is not such a great tailor because he 
   has a severe problem correctly taking down his customers' 
   measurements, an inadequacy that his father belittles every chance he 
   gets. It's as if the measuring tape is Thomas' worst enemy. The 
   sudden appearance of his sister Vera (Myriam Cyr), who is definitely 
   Dad's favorite sibling, throws Thomas' life into a spiral of madness. 
   Like her father, Vera is also a master tailor and can tell a person's 
   measurements by just looking at them. Also, like her father, Vera has 
   a cruel streak and when she learns of her brother's deficiency with a 
   tape measure (She says to him, &quot;A real tailor can take 
   measurements by eye!&quot;), she belittles him endlessly in front of 
   customers. It doesn't help that most of Thomas' customers have the 
   oddest shapes and deformities this side of a Charles Addams drawing 
   (extremely obese; exceedingly long arms, etc), but Thomas still 
   soldiers on in hopes of perfecting his craft. It gets to the point 
   that when he <A HREF="kill_by_inches_1999.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/kill by inches vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>looks
    at anyone, all he sees are numbers, but those numbers are usually 
   always wrong. When customers begin complaining about Thomas' work and 
   Vera has to fix them, Thomas slowly goes mad. The questions to the 
   viewer are these: Is everything Thomas sees real or is it all in his 
   mind? Is the annoying sewing machine repairman, Hector (Christopher 
   Zach), having an affair with his sister? Does he even exist at all? 
   When Thomas starts noticing that his customers are now going to rival 
   tailors, he begins killing them, starting with young boy Albert 
   (Nicholas Tafaro), who complained that the pirate costume Thomas made 
   for him was cutting off circulation to his hand. Thomas then turns 
   his deadly intentions towards his sister. He disposes of all her 
   asthma medication (At least I think it's asthma medication. It's a 
   thick, black viscous liquid that Vera secretly inhales in the 
   bathroom when she doesn't think Thomas is looking.) and when she 
   passes out, he wraps her in measuring tape and safety pins, making 
   her look like some weird mummy. He then goes to the annual Tailor's 
   Ball, where he wins the competition, yet all his father has to say to 
   him is that maybe next year his sister will show up, win the 
   competition and make him proud. What does a son have to do to win his 
   father's approval, get a sex change?&nbsp; Before anyone starts 
   jumping down my throat, let me begin by saying that this film is not 
   for everyone. Hell, I'll even go as far as to state that this film is 
   not for 95% of the movie-going audience. This is an extremely slow, 
   deliberately paced psychological chiller that takes it's own sweet 
   time to get to the payoff. This is also a well-made independent film 
   (partially financed by the Independent Film Channel), 
   directed/produced/scripted by Arthur Flam and Diane Doniol-Valcroze, 
   who would later write the screenplay for the horror film <B><A HREF="penny_dreadful_2006.htm">PENNY
    DREADFUL</A></B> (2006). The film is relatively (though not 
   completely) dialogue-free until the Tailor's Ball finale, where 
   Thomas must face-off with other tailors by guessing the measurements 
   of various models that they have never seen before. It's a surreal 
   experience that can't be properly explained with mere words. I guess 
   &quot;surreal&quot; is the best way to describe the whole film, as 
   the people appearing in it don't look or act quite like any human 
   beings you're ever liable to meet and the entire film has an 
   otherworldly, yet familiar, look to it, like David Lynch shot a film 
   set in the 1950's but left some modern-day items on view in the 
   background just to throw us off. It's very disarming and creepy, 
   especially with the ambient music soundtrack that drones in the 
   background of nearly every scene and Thomas constantly eyeing that 
   sharp spike that protrudes from the tailor shop's wall. Though not 
   for everyone's tastes, <B><A HREF="kill_by_inches_1999b.htm">KILL BY INCHES</A></B> 
   is a relatively oddball and effective little psycho flick for those 
   who care more about mood than blood and guts. According to the <A HREF="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</A>,
    the only previous credits Mr. Flam and Ms. Doniol-Valcroze have 
   before this are a series of short films they directed in the 90's. I, 
   for one, will definitely check out anything they make in the future 
   because they have a signature that's hard to duplicate. Available on

    OF THE ANTS</A><A NAME="King Ants"></A> (2004) -</B> This strange 
   film by Stuart Gordon, rewards the patient viewer. This is not a 
   horror film, so those looking to rent it for the horror aspects 
   (including the nifty, if deceiving box art) are bound to be 
   disappointed, even though there are horrific images on view. This 
   begins like a standard thriller where down-on-his-luck housepainter 
   Sean Crawley (Chris McKenna) is propositioned by <A HREF="king_of_the_ants_2004.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/king of the ants vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="114" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>electrician
    &quot;Duke&quot; Wayne (a terrific George Wendt) to come and work 
   for his boss Ray Mathews (Daniel Baldwin). Ray asks Sean to follow 
   Eric Gatley (Ron Livingston) around town and report Gatley's 
   movements back to him. Sean follows Gatley around on his bike (!), 
   taking pictures and notes. He spies on Gatley's wife, Susan (Kari 
   Wuhrer) and begins to fantasize about her. While sitting drunk in his 
   car, Ray asks Sean to kill Gatley for $13,000. Sean agrees and kills 
   Gatley in his home (a real disturbing scene that ends with Sean 
   dropping a refrigerator on the refusing-to-die Gatley, who keeps 
   repeating, &quot;There's someone at the door.&quot;). As a 
   precaution, Sean takes some incriminating papers from Gatley's 
   briefcase, which point to Ray's involvement in Gatley's death. When 
   Ray refuses to pay Sean for the hit, Sean tells Duke that he has a 
   folder that will fall into the right hands if he is not paid. This is 
   where things get weird. Sean goes through long, goosebump-inducing 
   torture scenes at the hands of Ray, Duke, Carl (Lionel Mark Smith) 
   and Beckett (Vernon Wells) which involves golf clubs, foam rubber and 
   a locked shed in the desert. Sean never gives up the folder and it 
   begins to seem like he looks forward to the next torture session. He 
   has hallucinations of Susan, at first sporting a penis and then as 
   some deformed monster that eats her own shit. Sean escapes with the 
   help of his friend George (Timm Sharp) after killing Duke by taking a 
   giant bite out of his neck. Sean goes to the homeless shelter where 
   Susan works, where she nurses him back to health and eventually takes 
   him home, the same home where he killed her husband weeks before. 
   Then things get even weirder....... To give away the rest of the film 
   would be doing a total disservice to the viewer. This remarkable film 
   is a disturbing look of how a seemingly normal person can shift gears 
   and become something that we would rather not dwell on. Everyone 
   involved in front of the camera does a terrific job (even the usually 
   routine Wuhrer excels here), but George Wendt (who is also a 
   co-producer) steals the show, shedding his Norm image from the <B><A HREF="cheers_tv_series_1983-1993.htm">CHEERS</A></B>

   a table topless and having her hands whacked with a pool cue) by a 
   league of hitmen called Assassins, Inc. (No, really!) looking for a

   driver/assassin and stealing his car. Corrupt FBI Agent Rick Pollard 
   (Joel D. McCrea Jr.), who has ties to Assassins, Inc., is sent out to 
   stop her, but finds himself falling in love with her. The rest of the 
   film contains copious nudity, very badly staged car chases, gun 
   fights and kung-fu fights, an orgy where a murder mystery party takes 
   place (and a murder actually happens), bad post-sync dubbing (why, oh 
   why, didn't they dub Harmon's thick German accent?) and an ending 
   which is so lame that you shake your head in disbelief (check out 
   that toy burning house!). It even promises a sequel at the end 
   credits, which thankfully never happened. While most reference 
   materials list this film as being made in 1985 and there is no 
   production date in the credits, I seriously doubt it as the fashions 
   and cars on display clearly put it in the mid-to-late 70's era. Liz

    times with swords. He eventually relents when they cut both his 
   hands off!). The Queen dies giving birth in the middle of the forest 
   and the child is raised by lions! Lion Man (Major Turkish star Cuneyt 
   Arkin, billed here as &quot;Steve Arkin&quot;), now all grown-up, 
   looks to win back his kingdom by killing all the enemies of his 
   father. This entails swinging from vines, uprooting trees with his 
   bare hands and beating people to death with them and roaring like a 
   lion (he can't speak) while using his hands like lion paws to rip the 
   faces off his enemies. Along the way, he falls in love with a 
   patriotic farm girl, even though she stabs him a couple of times. 
   Eventually, he will get into a final showdown with his father's 
   killer. Expect lots of blood and flying body parts. <B><A HREF="lion_man_1975d.htm">LION
    MAN</A></B> is enjoyable trash, even if it's for all the wrong 
   reasons. First off, the dubbing is atrocious, as all the voice talent 
   speak in a monotonous drone and it's never more noticable as when the 
   Queen goes into labor or when Lion Man's girl tries to teach him 
   English (he picks it up quickly). You'll be in stitches. Secondly, 
   the music score is wildly inappropriate. Most of the music cues seem 
   to be lifted from romance movies as the orchestras hit those 
   crescendos usually reserved for when people kiss. The only problem is 
   that they play it during the battle scenes. The film is also full of 
   hilarious dialogue. You'll hear lines like: &quot;That's King 
   Solomon's bitch!&quot; or &quot;&quot;Lock her up until she 
   dies!&quot; and &quot;What do you want you lousy bitch?&quot; Let's 
   not forget the outrageous action scenes where Lion Man and his new 
   fighting force (one guy looks loke Robert Tessier) maim, mangle and 
   generally decimate anyone who stands in their way. You'll marvel at 
   people who are mortally wounded that still fight as if it were only a 
   scratch, well-placed trampolines and poles that Lion Man (who's now a 
   gymnast!) uses to jump, spin and flip over his enemies. The 
   &quot;choreography&quot; used in the fight between Lion Man and his 
   half brother is better viewed than described. Let's just say that if 
   you don't laugh, it's quite possible that you were born without a 
   sense of humor. Director Natuch Baitan tosses in enough graphic 
   bloodshed, including gut-spilling, stabbings, appendage removal, 
   face-rippings and acid burnings (Lion Man loses the use of his hands 
   to acid, so he simply has the blacksmith fashion him a pair of steel 
   claws &quot;bigger and sharper than a lion's&quot;!) to make this a 
   must-see for fans of gory shenanigans. The sight of Lion Man scaling 
   a castle wall with his new hands is a sight to behold. Recommended 
   viewing for those who like it weird. Followed by an inferior sequel

   Extremely strange Italian genre film that's part psychological 
   thriller, part horror (mixed with a little science fiction) and 100% 
   weird, directed by Italy's master of the perverse, Renato Polselli. 
   This film is so rare that Italy declared it a lost film in 1978, a 
   mere four years after it was given a limited theatrical release in 
   Italy. It wasn't until after Polselli passed away in 2006 that a 
   print was found in his personal collection, the only known existing 
   print in the world<A HREF="mania _italy_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mania 1974 italy poster3 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="217" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   and it was transferred to DVD, which then was copied to torrents 
   sites and YouTube (which is how I saw it). This film deserved more 
   exposure, as it is horrific, delirious and, yes, manic and it is 
   bound to please anyone looking for something unusual and &quot;out there&quot;.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The film begins with Lisa (Eva Spadaro) and her fianc&eacute; Lailo 
   (Isarco Ravaioli; Polselli's <B><A HREF="truth_according_to_satan_1972.htm">THE
    TRUTH ACCORDING TO SATAN</A></B> - 1972) having an argument in a car 
   while Lisa is driving way too fast down a twisty mountain road. Lailo 
   thinks that Lisa is driving herself crazy over the death of her 
   husband, Professor Brecht (Brad Euston; Polselli's <B><A HREF="when_love_is_obscenity_1973-1980.htm">QUANDO
    L'AMORE E OSCENITA</A></B> [&quot;When Love Is Obscenity&quot; - 
   1973], another lost film, only this time it was banned outright by 
   Italy. All that exists of the film is a 1980 re-edit done by 
   Polselli.). Lisa loved her dead husband very much, as flashbacks show 
   us how the Professor was more interested in his experiments than his 
   marriage, showing Lisa how he was able the freeze a bee in 
   mid-flight, telling her that in the not too far-off future, he will 
   be able to cure any disease, even cancer, when he perfects his 
   experiments. Lisa doesn't care about that, she just wants her husband 
   to spend more time with her and love her. To make herself feel better 
   (or how she puts it &quot;to curse love&quot;), she starts having an 
   affair with the Professor's twin brother Germano (also portrayed by 
   Euston). The Professor's pretty young assistant, Erina (Mirella 
   Rossi; Polselli's <B><A HREF="house_of_love_the_police_intervene_1973-1977.htm">HOUSE
    OF LOVE...THE POLICE INTERVENE</A></B> - 1978), secretly loves the 
   Professor and knows about Lisa's betrayal, but doesn't tell him 
   because she doesn't want to hurt his feelings. One day, when the 
   Professor comes up the stairs to give Lisa a bouquet of flowers (he 
   may have perfected his experiments), Erina tries to stop him because 
   Lisa is outside making whoopee with his brother and she doesn't want 
   him to see it. The Professor becomes enraged with Erina, taking the 
   plastic bag containing the flowers and putting it over Erina's head, 
   forcing her to pass out, blood from her mouth filling up the bag. He 
   then goes up the stairs and sees his wife with his brother, but he's 
   surprisingly calm. It turns out that when he put the plastic bag over 
   Erina's head, it caused her to go deaf and dumb (!), so he spends all 
   his free time with Erina, feeling guilty on what he did to her and 
   ignoring Lisa completely. Of course, this pisses off Lisa even more 
   and shortly thereafter, the Professor's laboratory catches fire and 
   the Professor is trapped in the lab, Lisa refusing to open the metal 
   gate to the laboratory for Germano (she has the only key) so he can 
   save his brother. Germano finds an alternate way to get into the lab 
   and drags his brother out of the lab, but it is too late, he's dead 
   and his body is still burning. To make matters worse, Germano is 
   seriously injured, his hands and face hideously burned and he will 
   eventually have his legs amputated.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Back in the present, Lisa notices a white car following them, the 
   same car she nearly crashed in to when it was sitting in the middle 
   of the road. Lailo tells her to let the car pass, which she does, 
   only when she looks in the car, no one is driving it! The driverless 
   car then stops in the middle of the road around a hairpin turn and 
   Lisa nearly crashes into it again, but Lailo grabs the wheel and 
   steers them to safety. The car begins following them again and Lailo 
   once again tells Lisa to let it pass, which it does, only this time 
   the car stops at the side of the road and Lisa and Lailo stop their 
   car, get out and take a look inside the driverless car. The 
   driverless car tries to run them over, but fails and then takes off. 
   Lailo says that only one man could make a car do that, but he's dead 
   (Lailo was the Professor's assistant at the university). When Lisa 
   and Lailo get home, friend Katia (Ivana Giordan) says a strange man 
   came to the door to deliver a package for Lisa. Lisa opens the 
   package and inside it is a miniature coffin, an exact replica of the 
   coffin the Professor was put in, which now rests in the basement of 
   his villa. Lisa then goes totally mental and has to be hospitalized. 
   Her psychiatrist, Dr. Lous (Max Dorian; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#KidnapSyndicate">KIDNAP
    SYNDICATE</A></B> - 1975), tells Lisa that if she wants to live a 
   normal life she will have to confront her demons (Lisa may have 
   killed her husband), saying that she has to spend time in her dead 
   husband's villa to fight those demons. And fight she will.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    To make matters worse, Germano also lives in the villa, now legless 
   and in a wheelchair, his face and hands scarred by fire, yet he still 
   pines for Lisa. Also still living there is Erina, still deaf and mute 
   (She spends the rest of the film dressed only in a man's red shirt, 
   no panties or bra!), her only pleasure is going down the basement to 
   fondle the Professor's coffin!. Germano's only pleasure in life is 
   torturing the poor Erina, whipping her with a cat o' nine tails and 
   running her over in his wheelchair! What Lisa goes through is better 
   seen than described, but I'll try to make it quick and concise.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As soon as Lisa sets foot in the villa, the shit starts hitting the 
   fan and the film begins to go off the rails. In her bedroom, she sees 
   the visage of her dead burned husband walking towards her outside on 
   the patio, telling Lailo what she saw. He goes to look, finding black 
   shoeprints on the patio leading to Lisa's bedroom window, but he 
   tells Lisa they look old, as if they were there for a while. Lisa 
   then tells Lailo that she doesn't want him staying at the villa. If 
   she is going to get better, she has to do it alone, so Lailo leaves 
   (but we will see him again). Lisa begins to see her dead husband 
   everywhere, sometimes burned beyond recognition and sometimes normal, 
   but he always cries out, &quot;Lisa! Lisa! LISA!&quot; (It becomes 
   comical after a while, as we will hear him say that more than a few 
   times in this film). The question soon becomes: Is Lisa going crazy 
   or is there another explanation? Luckily (?) for Lisa, Katia has come 
   to the villa to take care of her on Dr. Lous' orders. But is Katia 
   actually trying to help Lisa or does she have more nefarious plans? 
   You'll be asking yourself that very question, as Katia seems to take 
   pleasure in seeing Lisa go mad. Poor Erina is being treated worse 
   than a dog by Germano, but why does Katia moan in pleasure when 
   Germano runs his burned hands over her breasts? And why is Lailo 
   creeping about the villa grounds at night? Don't worry, all your 
   questions will eventually be answered, but first you are going to 
   experience some very strange goings-on in and around the villa, such 
   as Erina and Katia having a naked catfight on Lisa's bed (that 
   eventually turns into a lesbian encounter!) and Lisa getting covered 
   in netting and then being attacked by eels (you have to see it to 
   believe it!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    <B>Warning: SPOILERS!!! Do not read the following paragraph if you 
   do not want to know how the film ends!</B> It seems that Germano 
   isn't Germano at all, but Professor Brecht! Yes, he perfected his 
   experiments and was able to reverse the damage that happened to him 
   in the fire and heal himself (I know it makes no sense, as we saw him 
   nothing but a dead crispy critter, but just go along with it). The 
   Professor tricked out the house with all manner of 3-D projectors and 
   holograms, which he controlled with a remote control he hid in the 
   wheelchair, all for the sake of driving Lisa mad (He blames Lisa for 
   trying to kill him). When Lailo comes to the villa the following 
   morning, he finds Katia dead, her bloody body outside Lisa's bedroom 
   (Lisa sliced Katia to pieces with a broken wine bottle) and watches 
   helplessly as Lisa commits suicide by jumping off the roof of the 
   villa (after Lisa bashes him bloody in the back of the head over and 
   over with a candlestick!), her dead body landing in a fork in a tree. 
   When Erina sees Lisa's dead body, she can immediately speak and hear 
   again (her first word is &quot;love&quot;). What happens to the 
   Professor, you may ask? When he sees his plan come to fruition, he 
   pulls out a derringer and shoots himself in the head, his last words 
   being, &quot;Lisa! Lisa! LISA!&quot; He will now spend all eternity 
   with Lisa (probably in Hell, not Heaven), which is all that Lisa 
   wanted. Oh, and Lailo and Erina become lovers! <B>END OF SPOILERS!!!</B></FONT></FONT><BR>

    This frenetic piece of pop art cinema could have only have come from

   (1973) and even his much earlier <B><A HREF="#VampireBallerina60">THE 
   VAMPIRE AND THE BALLERINA</A></B> (1960). Polselli's '70s films were 
   always getting in trouble with Italy's censors, most of them getting 
   the most strict rating (18 or over) and some of them being banned 
   outright. Trying to describe this film was a real chore because it is 
   more visual than anything else. I got a definite Carroll Baker (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#FourthVictim1971">THE
    FOURTH VICTIM</A></B> - 1971; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#FlowerDeadlySting73">THE
    FLOWER WITH THE DEADLY STING</A></B> - 1973) vibe from actress Eva 
   Spadaro as Lisa, this being her only film (which is too bad because 
   she is good here). She not only looks like Baker from certain angles, 
   she also acts like her, too. I can picture Ms. Baker in this film as 
   Lisa and nothing would have to be altered to fit her talents. There 
   is also plenty of eye candy on view, as Mirella Rossi runs around 
   most of the time in that red shirt and we patiently wait for that 
   shirt to rise (it does) or come off (that, too). When she and Ivana 
   Giordan get into the catfight on Lisa's bed, it answers any nagging 
   questions you will have as to how far Polselli will go when it comes 
   to showing nudity (The answer being all the way!). There are also 
   plenty of weird visuals on view, including the eel attack (where in 
   the hell did they come from???) and some of the Professor's weird 
   inventions, including Erina being chained up to a piece of corrugated 
   sheet metal and when Lisa tries to free her, the Professor flicks a 
   switch and a piece of glass comes down, pressing against Lisa and 
   Erina's faces, while the sheet metal curls up, acting like a cocoon, 
   engulfing Erina (it's better seen than described). There's also 
   &quot;Germano&quot; trying to run over Lailo with his wheelchair for 
   daring to step on his property. It raised more than a few chuckles 
   from me as Lailo tries to avoid the wheels on the chair from running 
   over his toes (it looks like some twisted dance between Germano and 
   Lailo). The sound of barking and howling dogs fills the soundtrack, 
   but not once do we ever see a dog! And wait until you see the 
   maggot-ridden body in the Professor's coffin! I could go on and on 
   about this little-seen film, but it's better if you search it out and 
   experience it for yourself. Polselli rarely disappoints, as this film 
   will show you.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    the story in a nutshell: Demented person B.J. Lang (Rooney), who 
   believes he is the best film director in the world, kidnaps Carlotta 
   (Luana Anders) to star in his latest film. The only problem is that 
   Lang is making this movie in his mind and torments Carlotta every 
   chance he gets. Rooney dresses as Cyrano De Bergerac, puts on red 
   lipstick and blue eyeshadow, sings &quot;Chattanooga Choo-Choo&quot; 
   over and over, and gives orders to imaginary people as he holes up in 
   a cobweb-filled abandoned theater (or meat storage facility, it's 
   that confusing). He makes Carlotta recite lines and sees old naked 
   people prancing around in his mind. Director Yabo Yablonsky (his only 
   directorial effort, thank God, although he had written screenplays 
   for <B><A HREF="revenge_for_a_rape_1976.htm">REVENGE FOR A RAPE</A> </B>[1976],
    <B><A HREF="jaguar_lives_1979.htm">JAGUAR LIVES!</A></B> [1979] and 
   others before passing away in 2005), films the sets with weird camera 
   angles, freeze frames, sped-up and slo-mo photography, non-stop talk 
   and imaginary scenes taken from the mind of Lang (including an orgy). 
   All of this is done to cover the fact that there is just not enough 
   movie here to fill a thirty minute time slot, even though the film 
   runs over 90 minutes. I never thought I would say this in my life: I 
   actually felt sorry for Mickey Rooney and he has made some bad 
   choices in his career (<B><A HREF="silent_night_deadly_night_5_the_toy_maker_1991.htm">SILENT

   I've been sitting on this DVD of this notoriously bad regional El 
   Paso, Texas-lensed horror oddity for several years (I have never seen 
   it!), because I heard that it should only be watched in a certain 
   &quot;state of mind&quot;, but since I've given up most recreational 
   activities (In other words, I'm old and boring), I have decided to 
   watch this film with a clear mind. If I <A HREF="manos_the_hands_of_fate_1966.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/manos the hand of fate dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="184" HEIGHT="264" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>were
    a religious man, I would ask you all to pray for me, but since I'm 
   not, a pained expression will do. The film opens with a vacationing 
   family; husband Michael (director/producer/screenwriter Harold P. 
   Warren), wife Margaret (Diane Mahree), small pain-in-the-ass daughter 
   Debbie (Jackey Neyman) and pet poodle Pepe, getting hopelessly lost 
   in their car. A couple of cops pull them over for a missing taillight (<B>Michael:</B> 
   &quot;Can't you give us a break, Officer? We are running kind of 
   late.&quot; <B>Officer:</B> &quot;If you're running late, you should 
   have started earlier!&quot;), but instead of asking the cops for 
   directions, Michael lets the cops get back in their car and drive 
   away. After a few minutes of badly-shot travelogue footage 
   photographed from the passenger side of Michael's car, Michael makes 
   a wrong turn and ends up on a dirt road he can't seem to find a way 
   to get off of. They finally find a house in the middle of nowhere and 
   stop to ask for directions. They should have kept driving instead. 
   They meet Torgo (John Reynolds, who committed suicide shortly after 
   this film was completed), a twitchy, bearded hippie-like character 
   who dresses like a hobo and walks around carrying a strange staff 
   topped-off with a sculpture of a hand. He introduces himself by 
   saying, &quot;I am Torgo. I take care of the place while The Master 
   is away.&quot; (Succinct and to the point. I think I'm gonna like 
   this guy!). When Michael ask Torgo for directions out of this 
   hellhole, Torgo replies, &quot;There is no way out of here!&quot; (He 
   also makes a comment that The Master doesn't like children or small 
   dogs). Rather than questioning Torgo's response, Michael asks Torgo 
   if they can spend the night at the house (<B>Torgo:</B> &quot;The 
   Master wouldn't approve...[awkward long pause]...Very well. The 
   Master will be very disturbed!&quot;) and then carries their luggage 
   into the house (John Reynolds is wearing prosthetics that are 
   supposed to be goat's legs and hooves, but he mistakenly wore the 
   prosthetics backwards, giving him one of the funniest fake walks 
   since Monty Python's &quot;Silly Walks&quot; sketch. It's a shame 
   that director Warren never pans the camera down to his feet so we can 
   see the prosthetics, because the pain it caused Reynolds led to his 
   addiction to pain killers, which led to his suicide!). Once inside 
   the house, Michael and Margaret are spooked by a painting of The 
   Master posing with a Doberman pincher with glowing eyes. Margaret is 
   under the impression that The Master is dead, but Torgo quickly 
   interjects, &quot;Not dead the way you know it. He is with us 
   always.&quot; (Torgo repeats it several times, just so Margaret 
   understands, but she just blankly stares at him). When Margaret hears 
   howling outside, she begs Michael to &quot;make it stop&quot;, so 
   Michael goes outside and grabs a flashlight and pistol out of the 
   car's glovebox (this is Texas after all!), but Pepe gets loose and is 
   torn apart by whatever is making the howling noise (Michael picks up 
   Pepe's lifeless body like it is radioactive and buries it in the 
   desert). Debbie is heartbroken over the loss of Pepe (she shows her 
   volatile emotions by rubbing her eyes a couple of times!), so Michael 
   and Margaret decide to leave, but (surprise!) the car won't start. 
   Torgo tells Margaret when they have some alone time together that The 
   Master wants her as his wife (&quot;He has many wives.&quot;), but 
   Torgo puts the moves on her (She begs Torgo to stop in one of the 
   worst acting performances of the 60's and then suddenly agrees not to 
   tell Michael about it!). Things come to a boil when Michael and his 
   family discover The Master (Tom Neyman) laying on an altar with all 
   of his wives (dressed in white flowing gowns) standing<A HREF="manos_the_hands_of_fate_1966b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/manos the hands of fate poster small2.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="162" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   around him in a hypnotic trance. Torgo knocks-out Michael and ties 
   him to a post while The Master wakes up from his deep sleep and 
   performs a ritual in front of a statue of Manos. The Master's wives 
   awaken and argue over the fate of Debbie (some want to kill her and 
   others don't), so they all get into a giant catfight! The Master 
   punishes Torgo for his infidelities by burning off his hand (and 
   holding the hand in front of the camera while it burns down to the 
   bone!), while his first wife (Stephanie Nielson) has had enough of 
   his chicanery and pays for it with her life (after The Master slaps 
   her silly!). Michael and his family escape into the desert and then 
   suddenly decide that the best place to hide is back at the house 
   (after Michael shoots at a stock shot of a rattlesnake!). The finale 
   reveals that Michael is now the new Torgo and Margaret and Debbie are 
   The Master's new wives! I almost had a tear in my eye (from laughter, 
   that is!). The film ends with a &quot;THE END?&quot; title card, but 
   I think it's safe to say this is the last time we'll see the exploits 
   of The Master and his gang.&nbsp; Awful doesn't adequately describe 
   how truly horrible <B><A HREF="manos_the_hands_of_fate_1966b.htm">MANOS:
    THE HANDS OF FATE</A></B> (which literally translates to &quot;<B><I>Hands:
    The Hands Of Fate</I></B>&quot;!) really is and if it wasn't for all 
   the hysterical acting, bad post-synch dubbing and simply unbelievable 
   dialogue, this film would be a chore to sit through. 
   Director/producer/screenwriter/star Harold P. Warren was a fertilizer 
   salesman by trade and it's obvious he had no idea how to make a film, 
   as scenes look incomplete, most of the time the camera never moves 
   (except for some zooming-in on objects that have nothing to do with 
   the scene, such as the camera closing-in on Michael and Margaret 
   holding hands when they realize Debbie has disappeared) or is out of 
   focus and the piano and saxophone music score (a faux kind of jazz) 
   is totally inappropriate. Thankfully, the film is only 69 minutes in 
   length (although it seems at least twice as long), so it didn't take 
   up too much of my time. <B><A HREF="manos_the_hands_of_fate_mst3000_.htm">MYSTERY

   two opinions: 1) He's one of the best independent directors around 
   and deserves all the accolades he is receiving for this film, or; 2) 
   He's one of the most dangerous and insane men on the planet and 
   should be put away for the rest of his natural born life. Everyone 
   born before 1969 knows the story of Charles Manson. If not, I'm not 
   going to explain it here as you can go out and rent or buy both 
   versions of <B>HELTER SKELTER</B> (<A HREF="helter_skelter_1976.htm">1976</A>

    HELTER SKELTER MURDERS</A></B> (1970) or countless other films that 
   dwell on Manson (including the seldom-seen <B><A HREF="manson_massacre_1976.htm">THE
    MANSON MASSACRE</A></B> - 1976). This film is not his story, but the 
   story of his followers, a bunch of drug and sexed-out outcasts just 
   looking for someone to lead them on a path to glory. And what glory 
   they achieve. When not dropping acid, smoking pot or having group 
   sex, they really have nothing else to do except listen to the crazed 
   ramblings of Manson (played here with extreme minimalism by Marcelo 
   Games). Told as a series of interviews using both film (with fake 
   emulsion scratches) and video, flashbacks and intercut with scenes of 
   four kids in 1996 about to attack a TV studio that is going to run a 
   Manson documentary the next day, <B><A HREF="manson_family_2003b.htm">THE
    MANSON FAMILY</A></B> is a hard film to take your eyes off of. It is 
   also an assault on the senses, both aural (especially if you watch it 
   in 5.1 Dolby Surround) and visual. Filled with shock cuts, bloody 
   violence (especially the final 15 minutes), full frontal nudity and 
   sex (but not pornographic), this is a tragic story about how the end 
   of the 60's came to be known. Before the killings (Sharon Tate is 
   never mentioned here, but you know it's her when she is killed), the 
   60's were known as the free-love, pot-smoking, anti-war generation, 
   where everything was permissible as long as it felt good. The Manson 
   family changed all that. The story Vanbebber tells is a vivid and 
   mostly true one (the 1996 sections nonwithstanding), told in such an 
   in-your-face way, that you can't help but get involved. All the 
   actors (including Vanbebber as Bobby) are non-pros, whichs adds to 
   the realism and, when the violence does erupt, it is unrelenting. I 
   would give this film a big thumbs-up if I weren't afraid of pissing 
   off the victims' families of Manson's followers (whose names are 
   never mentioned thoughout the entire film, probably due to legal 
   reasons). It's still a powerful document of how people with nothing 
   to look forward to are easily manipulated and how it can still happen 
   today. Jim Vanbebber started this film in 1997 and did not have the 
   funds to complete it. <A HREF="http://www.blue-underground.com">Blue Underground</A> 
   stepped up to the plate and gave him the capital to finish the film. 
   I endorse this film only for people that can handle violence in a 
   realistic way and realize that something like this can (and does) 
   happen all the time. This is a film about the alienation of youth and 
   unless we, society in general, do something about it, history will 
   keep repeating itself over and over. Also starring Marc Pitman, 
   Leslie Orr, Maureen Alisse, Amy Yates, Tom Burns and Michelle Briggs.

   the new footage on video rather than film!) and adding a subplot 
   involving a captive Marilyn Monroe (played by Francine York; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#WelcomeHomeSoldier">WELCOME
    HOME, SOLDIER BOYS</A></B> - 1972). That film became <B>MARILYN 
   ALIVE AND BEHIND BARS</B>. Then, in 1997, screenwriter Philip Yordan 
   (who wrote <B>MARILYN</B>) ditched the Marilyn footage and compiled 
   his own unauthorized (and unfinished) version, titled it <B><A HREF="scream_your_head_off.htm">SCREAM
    YOUR HEAD OFF</A></B> and sold the VHS rights to <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Simitar">Simitar
    Entertainment</A>, who released it on crappy, unwatchable EP-mode 
   tapes only as part of their &quot;From Academy Award Winner Philip 
   Yordan&quot; series (Yordan died in 2003). The<A HREF="marilyn_alive_and_behind_bars_1982_1993.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/marilyn alive and behind bars dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   question remains: Is <B>MARILYN</B> worth all the trouble? I guess 
   the answer depends on how you feel about stitched-together films. The 
   film opens with newly-shot footage of halfwit Sidney (Mark Petrich) 
   putting a rose on Marilyn Monroe's crypt and then biking over to 
   Pinewood Sanitarium (where Richard Moll, in 1982 footage, greets him 
   but they are never in the same shot), where he serves a still-alive 
   Marilyn Monroe breakfast in her opulent apartment/prison cell (the 
   walls are decorated with photos and memorabilia of her career, 
   including a candid shot with Robert Mitchum). We then switch to Harry 
   Billings (John Phillip Law; <B><A HREF="#BloodDelirium1988">BLOOD DELIRIUM</A></B> 
   - 1988), as his car containing his wife of one-day flies off a bridge 
   in a terrible accident, killing her. Harry tries to commit suicide 
   and ends up a patient of Pinewood Sanitarium, where the evil Dr. 
   Brewer (Arthur Braham), love-lorn Dr. Fargo (Sharon Ratcliff) and 
   brutish orderly Otto (Moll) give Harry electroshock treatments to 
   keep him in line. They brainwash Harry into becoming their new 
   minion, but when he finds Marilyn's locked door, he steals the keys 
   and meets the real Marilyn Monroe (Or is she?). She tells him a story 
   about a lookalike Marilyn being killed years earlier and she's been 
   locked in this room ever since (probably with the help of the Kennedy 
   family), but Harry is so brainwashed, he refuses to believe Dr. 
   Brewer or Dr. Fargo are bad people. They hypnotize Harry into 
   kidnapping girls just off the bus and bringing them back to the 
   sanitarium, where Dr. Brewer and Fargo &quot;condition&quot; them and 
   sell them to white slavers on the black market. Harry pays more 
   midnight visits to Marilyn and discovers that the doctors are giving 
   her shots to &quot;forget&quot; who she is (on one visit, she tells 
   Harry she is twelve years old!). Things start to fall apart when 
   Harry kidnaps barmaid Verna (Lisa Watkins) and is followed by a 
   mysterious white-haired man. Harry begins questioning his role at the 
   sanitarium (he begins to have terrible nightmares of his crimes), so 
   Dr. Brewer increases his hypnotic injections, but Harry starts to get 
   a conscience and refuses to bring any more girls back to the 
   sanitarium. Can Harry find happiness with Marilyn and escape the 
   sanitarium? Or will the horny Dr. Fargo get Harry all to 
   herself?&nbsp; The main difference between this version and the 
   versions on <B>NIGHT TRAIN TO TERROR</B> and <B>SCREAM YOUR HEAD OFF</B> 
   (besides the obvious Marilyn footage) is that <B>MARILYN ALIVE AND 
   BEHIND BARS</B> deletes the gory black market human organs subplot 
   that is so prominently displayed in the other two versions. Gone is 
   the sequence where Otto is in a big meat freezer chopping up a body 
   as the camera lingers on decapitated human heads and other body 
   parts. As a matter of fact, <B>MARILYN</B> is a rather chaste and 
   bloodless film (we do get to see Otto with the meat cleaver, but the 
   scene is re-edited in a way to convey he's killing an escaped female 
   captive rather than chopping-up an already-dead body), with no 
   nudity, very little violence (we get a quick shot of two severed 
   heads stored in jars, but most of the other violence, including 
   Otto's beheading and a lobotomized Dr. Brewer performing an 
   &quot;operation&quot; on Dr. Fargo, has all been edited out) and no 
   foul language. Considering the subject matter, that's quite a feat. 
   If you can forgive the obvious change in film stock and Law's change 
   in age and hair style from scene-to-scene, you may find some 
   enjoyment here, especially if you have seen the other two versions 
   first. An interesting piecemeal film. Also starring Rick Barnes, Jini 
   Flynn, Charles Parker, Micki Corbin, Peter Creadick and Carla 
   Marlenee. A Trinity Home Entertainment DVD Release. <B>Not Rated</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

    -</B> This bad taste horror comedy has only one redeeming feature: 
   The dry delivery of late comedian Jackie Vernon (he was the voice of 
   the animated Christmas perennial <B><A HREF="frosty_the_snowman_1969.htm">FROSTY
    THE SNOWMAN</A></B> [1969], for chrissakes!). Construction worker 
   Donald (Vernon) has a very serious problem: His forever-nagging wife 
   May (Claire Ginsberg) hasn't made him an edible meal in months (his 
   latest box lunch was a whole crab slapped on a roll) and he's getting 
   tired of eating all her mis-prepared meals. He even begins to eat dog 
   food because he thinks it tastes better than May's slop. Things only 
   get worse when May purchases a big-assed Major Electric microwave 
   oven (Model #X1-74A) and cooks Donald faster and even more inedible 
   cuisine (which she pronounces &quot;coo-zine&quot;). Donald 
   fantasizes about killing May until one day he goes too far and 
   actually kills her (he gets drunk at a bar, comes home, spits water 
   on dinner, pisses in the<A HREF="microwave_massacre_1978b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/microwave massacre vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="194" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   fireplace and caves May's head in with a pepper grinder). He wakes up 
   the next morning and finds May in the microwave and, as a final 
   tribute, microwaves her body on high. He saws up her body into 
   pieces, wraps them in aluminum foil and puts them in the refrigerator 
   next to the other leftovers. One night, he accidentally grabs one of 
   her body parts (thinking it's a leftover) and eats it. He likes the 
   taste and soon he is bringing box lunches of May meat to his 
   construction site. His friends, Rosie (Loren Schein) and Philip (Al 
   Toupe), take bites and Donald's lunches become the hit of the 
   construction site. Soon, he is creating different dishes from May's 
   body parts and serving them to his friends. When Philip mentions that 
   the meat is beginning to taste old and tough, Donald gets the idea 
   that maybe younger women would taste better. He begins bringing 
   prostitutes home and giving them the old X1-74A treatment (&quot;I'm 
   so hungry, I could eat a whore!&quot;). The microwave proves to be 
   Donald's achille's heel, however, as the pacemaker in his chest 
   malfunctions every time he uses the microwave. He can't help his 
   addiction, though, as Rosie and Philip find him lying next to the 
   oven, dead of a heart attack, a full plate of arms and hands sitting 
   in the microwave.&nbsp; This really is a pretty piss-poor film only 
   made bearable by Jackie Vernon (who actually died of a heart attack 
   in 1987), in a rare filmic outing. Director Wayne Berwick (whose 
   father, Irv Berwick, directed <B><A HREF="monster_of_piedras_blancas_1959.htm">MONSTER

   - 1978, amongst others) throws in every cheap sex joke imaginable and 
   only about 10% of it is funny. Thankfully, Berwick also throws in 
   plenty of female nudity to keep your eyes occupied through the slow 
   parts. The acting is uniformly awful from the mostly non-professional 
   cast and even Vernon looks like he's reading off cue cards on several 
   occasions. The gore, such as it is, consists of severed body parts 
   lying on the counter, in the microwave, in the refrigerator or being 
   eaten by the cast, all of it used for comical (?) effect. Things 
   reach the nadir when &quot;dark meat&quot; jokes are made about 
   eating the flesh of a dead black hooker and when Donald's sexy next 
   door neighbor uses a cordless vibrator to dig holes in her garden. 
   Another tasteless bit is when Donald is shown cutting up a Chinese 
   woman (for his &quot;Peking Chick&quot; dish), all you see on the 
   counter is a kabuki wig and a big pair of round eyeglasses. How you 
   feel about this film totally depends on your tolerance for cheap 
   jokes, bad acting and severed body parts. I must admit, I did laugh 
   out loud a couple of times even though I knew I shouldn't. The late <A HREF="late breaking news.htm#Robert A. Burns">Robert

    -</B> This head-scratcher of a film will have you doing double takes 
   (and maybe even spit takes!). This is mainly an action film 
   concerning drug dealing, double crosses and car chases but the title 
   character is so mean and unrelenting that it deserves <A HREF="mr_no_legs_1980c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mr. no legs vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="158" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>to
    be in the total weirdness category. A legless, wheelchair-riding mob 
   enforcer (Ron Slinker) works for his drug-running boss (Lloyd 
   Bochner), killing rivals with shotguns hidden in the armrests of his 
   wheelchair or jumping out of his chair (using his arms!) and 
   karate-chopping or knifing snitches and goons who get in his way. 
   When the daughter of a cop (Ted Vollrath) turns up dead, he and 
   partner Richard Jaeckel (<B><A HREF="grizzly_1976.htm">GRIZZLY</A></B> 
   - 1976) begin to track down those responsible. When they begin to get 
   too close, Mr. No Legs tries several times (quite unsuccessfully) to 
   kill the cops. This worries his boss, who begins to see him as more 
   of a liability than an asset, and orders him snuffed out along with 
   the cops. This does not sit well with Mr. No Legs......&nbsp; While 
   basically a cops and robbers film, the unusual Ron Slinker, who can't 
   act a lick (this was his only film role), makes you take notice. When 
   he leaps out of his chair (in slow motion), beating people up with 
   his stumps and even jumping into a swimming pool to take on two 
   hitmen, you begin to realize that this is strange stuff. Director 
   Ricou Browning (who played the Gillman in all three <B><A HREF="creature_from_the_black_lagoon_1954.htm">CREATURE
    FROM THE BLACK LAGOON</A></B> films) falters toward the end, when 
   Slinker is killed two-thirds of the way through the film and it turns 
   into a 25 minute car chase (provided by Joie Chitwood and the Danger 
   Angels), where crooked cop John Agar (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Night Fright">NIGHT
    FRIGHT</A></B> - 1967) races around the Florida panhandle trying to 
   avoid capture. Still, it's not a bad little film. It manages to keep 
   your attention due to the strange subject matter and the frequent 
   bloody fights, stabbings, legless kung-fu and shotgun blasts. Also 
   starring Rance Howard as a sidekick of Mr. No Legs. I picked this one 
   up on <A HREF="mr_no_legs_1980.htm">DVD-R</A> from 5 Minutes To Live.

   (1972) -</B> I really have nothing against arty horror films, but it 
   seems to me that some actual horror should be thrown-in with all the 
   pretentious philosophical dialogue and fancy camerawork, no? After an 
   on-screen quote by Edgar Cayce (&quot;You may not even have to come 
   back at all if you become perfectly developed in this life.&quot;), 
   we witness our young protagonist, known throughout most of the film 
   as the &quot;Student&quot; (Mark Travis), running through some dark 
   catacombs, trying to escape some unseen force chasing him. Our 
   narrator, an old man called Mr. Walker (John Carradine; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Frankenstein Island">FRANKENSTEIN
    ISLAND</A></B> - 1981), takes us back in time to show us how the 
   Student ended up in this predicament. It's 1920, and the Student, who 
   is a pastel painter and sketch artist, is hitchhiking through the 
   California desert, when he ends up at an old mission that's been 
   converted to a hotel. Mr. Walker happens by while the Student is 
   painting a picture of the hotel and tells him that he should pay 
   close attention to &quot;the bells&quot;, especially the one with a 
   &quot;No.7&quot; stamped on it. The seemingly-mad Mr. Walker takes 
   him to the hotel, where the Student becomes fascinated with the 
   building's architecture and meets an odd assortment of characters, 
   including the hotel's manager (Pat Renella), who makes the Student 
   register by signing the guestbook with his name and birthdate (the 
   manager may be the Devil himself); a <A HREF="moonchild_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/moonchild poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>mysterious
    gentleman called the Maitre D' (Victor Buono; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Evil1977">THE
    EVIL</A></B> - 1977), who tells the Student that everything he sees 
   is an illusion (he may actually be God or one of his angels); the 
   hunchbacked, one-eyed servant called Homonculus (Frank Corsentino); 
   the creepy maid (Marie Drew); and a beautiful girl (Janet Landgard), 
   who haunts the Student's dreams. When the manager finds out that the 
   Student's zodiac sign is Cancer, he dubs him &quot;Moonchild No. 
   7&quot; and from that moment on, he begins having flashbacks to a 
   previous life, when the hotel was just a mission a couple of 
   centuries earlier. It doesn't take a genius to deduct that Moonchild 
   No. 7's life is pre-destined to end up here and play out the same 
   pre-determined outcome as he did in six previous lives, with the same 
   set of characters that now occupy the hotel. The rest of the film is 
   a series of flashbacks-within-flashbacks, told in an artsy-fartsy 
   style (weird camera angles; close-ups of red meat being sliced and 
   consumed; quick, jackhammer-style editing) and containing many obtuse 
   conversations about life and death. This continues for 78 agonizing 
   minutes, as Moonchild No. 7 tries to alter his fate from repeating 
   itself. He fails miserably.&nbsp; <B><A HREF="moonchild_1972b.htm">MOONCHILD</A></B> 
   amounts to be nothing more than a USC film student's master thesis on 
   the cyclicity of life and reincarnation (this would make a great 
   companion piece with director Christopher Speeth's equally 
   long-winded <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Malatesta">MALATESTA'S 
   CARNIVAL OF BLOOD</A></B> [1973]). Director/writer Alan Gadney (Not 
   surprisingly, his only film credit. He's now a successful book 
   marketer.) and Director of Photography Emmett Alston (who went on to 
   direct such genre fare as <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#New Years Evil">NEW
    YEAR'S EVIL</A></B> [1980], <B><A HREF="action.htm#Tigershark1986">TIGERSHARK</A></B> 
   [1986] and <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Demonwarp">DEMONWARP</A></B> 
   [1988]) have fashioned a philosophical horror film where Renella's 
   Devil and Buono's God characters relentlessly battle for the soul of 
   the Student, while Carradine (who sometimes speaks directly to the 
   camera) tries to keep us up to speed in his dulcet, Shakespearean 
   voice. This is really nothing but a cheap reincarnation horror tale 
   dressed-up in convoluted dime-store Psych 101 dialogue (&quot;Seek 
   the life to perfection.&quot; &quot;God preserve us. The Devil rides 
   in women's loins!&quot;) and the occasional quick glimpse of 
   early-70's gore (blood gushing out of a sword wound; a throat 
   slashing). The flashback sequences (conceived by editor Jack Conrad, 
   director/writer of the obscure actioner <B><A HREF="country_blue_1973.htm">COUNTRY
    BLUE</A></B> [1973]), which take place in a Spanish Inquisition-like 
   atmosphere (where we find out that the Student actually has a proper 
   name, &quot;Gavilan&quot;), contains the film's only horror 
   sequences, but it comes so late in the film and you'll have to put up 
   with dialogue that's so heavy-handed and forced, it's hard to imagine 
   for anyone but those with the patience of a saint would give a damn. 
   Both Victor Buono and John Carradine (who has more spoken lines here 
   than ten of his latter-day horror films combined) are consummate 
   professionals (and, apparently, willing to help out a film student 
   for little or no money), but it's hard to give a rat's ass when the 
   film around them is such a pretentious bore. When <B><A HREF="moonchild_1972d.htm">MOONCHILD</A></B> 
   was released to U.S. theaters in 1974, it was advertised as an <B><A HREF="exorcist.htm">EXORCIST</A></B> (1973)-type
    film (The tag line reads: &quot;Racing Towards His Final Exorcism!). 
   Man, audiences must have been pissed when they realized they were 
   conned. Filmed at the still-standing (and operating) Mission Inn in 
   Riverside California. Also starring William Challee and Robert

   naked dancing girls and people dressed in skeleton costumes. Blake 
   leaves his family-owned architectual business and moves himself and 
   his wife to his late great grandfather's country estate, called The 
   Grove. There is a problem with this estate: Blake's great 
   grandfather, known as The Major, built The Grove and swore that after 
   his death, no one would ever inhabit it. Blake and his wife are the 
   first people to live in The Grove in over 50 years and almost 
   immediately Blake begins to experience strange phenomenon. A white 
   horse mysteriously appears and disappears. A voice continuously warns 
   him to get out of the house. He sees strange shadows cast on the

   Major has his sights set on Mrs. Blake. Oh, did I mention that he 
   takes part in a nude dancing orgy led by the town's preacher? It is 
   up to us, the viewer, to decide if all the stuff that is happening is

   the Producers to spice up this film with more gore behind Fragasso's 
   back, should also tell you what to expect. The film is a fractured 
   mess, jumping around from scene-to-scene with no connective tissue, 
   like some bonkers fever dream, but that could be the reason why I 
   couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Is the film any good?&nbsp; Oh, 
   my God, not by a long shot, as it is full of overblown, unbelievable 
   (a word you will read quite often in this review) acting by the cast, 
   but it does have a certain &quot;something&quot; I just cannot put my 
   finger on. I will say this: After the film's frustrating, 
   unbelievable and maddening conclusion, I wanted to take a 
   flame-thrower to my TV and Blu-Ray player, even though I have 
   previously seen the film before. I'm seriously beginning to believe 
   that there is something psychologically wrong with me. Why would I 
   purchase a Blu-Ray of a film that is as bad as they come? Why would I 
   want it to be part of my film library of over 10,000 films? I'm 
   afraid I'll never know the answer because, frankly, I'm too fucking 
   scared to find out why, so let's get to the film at hand.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The film opens with a theater full of awful dancers (really, they 
   are terrible) being berated by their overbearing choreographer (Gaby 
   Ford), when a female dancer arrives late for practice and apologizes, 
   the choreographer telling her to get changed quickly or she's fired. 
   The dancer goes to the dressing room to change, not knowing that 
   there's a killer in a rubber horror mask, who is also wearing horror 
   gloves with huge nails on them, making the killer look like a 
   cheapjack version of Freddy Krueger, is waiting for her. The killer 
   slices the dancer's throat with the sharp fingernails (even though we 
   can plainly see that the <A HREF="night_killer_1990.htm#RubberClawsPhoto">fingernails
    are made of soft rubber</A>!), killing her. When she is late joining 
   the other dancers, the furious choreographer goes looking for her and 
   gets the same treatment from the killer, only she tries to escape 
   from the killer and is pushed off the balcony, her dead body landing 
   in front of the dancers (And not one of them screams! Was she that 
   much of a bitch?).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We are then at the Virginia home of of Melanie Beck (Tara Buckman; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Xtro 2">XTRO
    2: THE SECOND ENCOUNTER</A></B> - 1991), who is letting her young 
   daughter, Clarissa (Tova Sardot), spend a weekend with her best 
   friend Sherman Floyd (Richard Foster) and his fiancee while she works 
   on her troubled marriage with her separated husband Axel (Peter 
   Hooten; <B><A HREF="action.htm#BrothersInBlood1987">BROTHERS </A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="action.htm#BrothersInBlood1987">I</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><A HREF="action.htm#BrothersInBlood1987">N
    BLOOD</A></B> - 1987) as Christmas approaches. When Melanie is home 
   alone, the masked, clawed killer appears and tries to kill Melanie; 
   then the screen goes black. We then see Melanie in the hospital, but 
   she has a severe case of amnesia and can't remember what happened 
   with the killer; all she does remember is that Sherman saved her and 
   received a huge wound on the left side of his face by the killer's 
   sharp claws. Police Detective Clark (Mel Davis) wants to question 
   Melanie, but her physician, Dr. Willow (Lee Lively), tells him no, it 
   may make her lose her memory completely, saying to give her some time 
   and her memory may come back. After being hospitalized and feeling 
   somewhat suicidal from her ordeal, Dr. Willow allows Melanie to go 
   home to recuperate, thinking it will be good for her memory (Really? 
   In the same house where she was nearly killed? Somebody take a look 
   at Dr. Willow's medical license to make sure it hasn't lapsed!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Melanie repeatedly gets visits from Axel (she has no memory of Axel 
   being her husband), who treats her brutally, <A HREF="night_killer_1990.htm#GunInMouthPhoto">sticking
    a gun in her mouth</A>, slapping her in the face and telling her to 
   get over herself, causing Melanie to sink further into depression, 
   even trying to kill herself on several occasions, but failing. On one 
   such occasion, Melanie takes a handful of sleeping pills, takes off 
   most of her clothes and tries to walk into the ocean, but Axel 
   intervenes, slapping her some more and screaming, &quot;You really 
   trying to kill yourself?&quot; He grabs her, walks into the water and 
   holds Melanie's head under the water as if to drown her (he's 
   actually making her drink the salty sea water to make her throw up 
   the pills she took!), but Melanie escapes and runs away. Yes, Axel 
   couldn't look more like the killer, but we know in films like this it 
   couldn't be that easy...or could it? Melanie tells Detective Clark 
   about Axel's murderous behavior and he becomes the number one 
   suspect, especially when the masked killer shows up in Melanie's 
   house and fails to kill her again. Sherman, meanwhile, argues with 
   his fiancee, telling her everyone looks at him differently with the 
   huge scar on his face, even her. Sherman tells her he is going after 
   the killer on his own; he's going to kill Axel.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    To make a long story short, Axel continues to avoid the police while 
   Sherman tries to hunt him down, but he's no bounty hunter. In a 
   surprise everyone saw coming, the killer pays Melanie another visit 
   at her home and her memory suddenly comes back. She rips off the 
   mask, revealing the killer to be Sherman. A flashback shows us what 
   happened on that fateful night when Melanie lost her memory. Sherman 
   has her tied to the bed, saying he was in love with her and if he 
   can't have her, nobody will, threatening to kill her with a 
   switchblade. He then comes up with a &quot;brilliant&quot; idea: He 
   will untie Melanie, hand her the knife and watch as she kills herself 
   (&quot;What a great idea!!&quot;, no one with half a brain would 
   say.). Of course things don't go as planned, for as soon as he hands 
   Melanie the switchblade, she slashes him in the face with it and runs 
   away, losing her memory in the process. Back in the present, Sherman 
   once again professes his love for Melanie, but since he can't 
   convince her to love him, she has to die. Melanie comes on to 
   Sherman, kissing him passionately and slowly pulling the switchblade 
   out of his pants pocket as she fondles him. She then stabs him in the 
   groin! Not dead (but in extreme penis pain), Sherman tries to kill 
   Melanie after pulling the knife out of his crotch, when Axel comes 
   crashing through a window and shoots Sherman several times with a 
   pistol, killing him. We then learn that Axel was acting like an 
   abusive asshole on Dr. Willow's orders, believing his violent 
   behavior would snap Melanie out of her amnesia! Even Detective Clark 
   was in on it! We then see Axel and Melanie happy in bed on Christmas 
   Eve, teaching Clarissa the old &quot;This is the church, this is the 
   steeple...&quot; hand gesture and laughing. Clarissa gets out of bed 
   and walks downstairs to bring one present under the Christmas tree to 
   her bedroom. While Mom &amp; Dad make lovey-dovey in their bed, 
   Clarissa takes the present into her room and begins to unwrap it. In 
   a sequence that can best be described as an editor on Adderal, the 
   scene is intercut with Clarissa opening the present with Axel and 
   Melanie making love. It is then revealed that Clarissa is wearing the 
   killer's mask, talking in the same disguised voice Sherman used, then 
   the film ends! WTF?!?<A HREF="night_killer_1990.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/night killer italy poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="171" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A></FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The reveal that Axel was working in tandem with Dr. Willow and 
   Detective Clark&nbsp; is just too unbelievable for words. What doctor 
   in their right mind would allow a husband to be verbally and 
   physically abusive to their wife? It's like director Claudio 
   Fragasso, who co-wrote the screnplay with Rosella Drudi (<B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#EmanuellePrison1983">EMANUELLE
    IN PRISON</A></B> - 1983, <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Shocking Dark">SHOCKING
    DARK</A></B> - 1989, <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Crawlers">THE CRAWLERS</A></B> 
   - 1990), ran out of ideas on how to properly conclude the film, so 
   they threw ideas against the wall to see which ones stick and this 
   was the best they could come up with. But it's the daughter wearing 
   the killer's mask in the closing shot that is even more unbelievable. 
   Who would give this young girl such a present is just one small 
   question you will have when the end credits begin to roll. Your head 
   will spin at all the unanswered questions this film offers. Quite 
   frankly, it's these unanswered questions that made me watch this film 
   not once, but twice (!) to make sure I didn't miss anything and, sure 
   enough, I didn't (In all fairness, I should state that it was Sherman 
   who gave Clarissa the present in the beginning of the film, something 
   I missed the first two times I watched it!). Fragasso has gone on 
   record saying that he wanted to make a purely psychological thriller 
   with no blood or gore, but without the gory inserts shot by Bruno 
   Mattei, this would be a chore to sit through. It's still quite a 
   chore due to the over-emoting by Peter Hooten (<B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#T2020TexasGladiator">2020
    TEXAS GLADIATORS</A></B> - 1982) and, especially, by Richard Foster 
   (who hasn't appeared in anything else of note) when it is revealed he 
   is the killer. His eyes nearly bulge out of their sockets and he 
   never loses his stupid smile, even when he is stabbed in the dick! 
   Couple that with the film's two denouements and you have a film that 
   people with small IQs are bound to love, which is why I am worried 
   about my psychological health! One scene that did make me laugh is 
   when Melanie first meets Axel in the ladies room, after losing her 
   memory. She pulls a pistol out of her pocketbook and makes Axel strip 
   down to his bikini underwear and flush his clothes down the toilet 
   (this building must have high pressure toilets!). Axel then comes 
   running out of the building, when a guard stops him and asks him why 
   he is wearing no clothes. Axel replies, &quot;I was just molested in 
   the little boys room!&quot; It should also be noted that Werner 
   Pochath, one of my favorite genre actors, was this film's Casting 
   Director. Pochath can be seen in such films as <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CatONineTails1971">THE

   With so many good genre films screaming-out to get their DVD debut, I 
   have to question why Code Red DVD would spend time, money and energy 
   to release this abomination (filmed in 1990, but not given a 
   copyright until 1995) on a shiny silver disc; a film so devoid of any 
   entertainment value, it was deemed unreleasable when screened (to 
   show you just how bad this film really is, it was made around the 
   same time by the same producer [Roger Racine] of <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Voodoo Dolls">VOODOO
    DOLLS</A></B> and <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Madonna">MADONNA: A CASE 
   OF BLOOD AMBITION</A></B> [both 1990], yet it was the only one in the 
   trio not to obtain a distributor). Maybe Code Red obtained the 
   distribution rights for little or no money, but in this tough 
   economy, I fail to see Code Red's thought process, never mind their 
   business acumen, in hoisting such an unknown and terrible film on an 
   audience starving for quality product (or at least something with 
   entertainment value). To me, it's business suicide, but what do I 
   know, I bought the DVD so I could review it! I certainly doubt that 
   this will be a best seller, but I'm sure some genre fans will pick 
   this up just for the novelty value, but it's a novelty that wears off 
   after watching the first five minutes of this filmic turd. Actor/impressionist
    Fred Travalena (who passed away in late June of 2009, a little more 
   than two months before this was finally released on DVD) plays three 
   roles in this kitchen sink comedy, which aims for <B><A HREF="airplane_1980.htm">AIRPLANE</A></B>

    about a killer in a tracksuit and a basketball mask who goes around 
   murdering members of the world's worst college basketball team, the 
   Watergate Plumbers (my head hurts already). After a teammate is found 
   beheaded (the head being led away on a stretcher while the team takes 
   a group photo), Coach Cherry (Travalena) wonders out loud if this is 
   going to affect the attendance of tonight's game (this is when I 
   popped my first Tylenol). At that game, play-by-play announcer Dick 
   Airhead (Travalena again; and I swallowed my second Tylenol) does 
   several impressions (including Clint Eastwood and Sammy Davis Jr.) 
   while introducing the members of the Plumbers to a very sparse crowd 
   (not because of the beheading, but because of the film's miniscule 
   budget). Equipment manager Stan Bates (Gregory Calpakis) complains to 
   the coach that he is never put in the game as a player (Hint! Clue!), 
   while Dick Airhead does more impressions (including Bela Lugosi and 
   Herve Villechaize) as the game progresses (at this time, I switched 
   from Tylenol to Advil). Stan's girlfriend Becky (Flavia Carrozzi) 
   makes a remark that Stan's a better player than anyone on the team, 
   but Stan replies that it will probably take more teammates being 
   killed before he gets any play time (at this point, I switched to 
   smoking a joint, not only to forget about my headache, but because 
   everything seems better with a little pot). After the Plumbers lose 
   once again to their rivals, the Greenfield Gators (the Plumbers 
   haven't won a game in six years), Dean Cook (Michael Sullivan), the 
   head of Greenfield, makes a bet with Watergate head Dean Marks 
   (Cynthia Mantel) that the loser of their next basketball game will 
   have to get a tattoo on a body part of the winner's choice and will 
   also have to ride naked on the rival's parade float. When the 
   Plumbers' star player, High Top (George Thomas, who plays his role 
   like a young Elvis Presley and provides behind-the-scenes info on the 
   DVD's commentary track, along with Travalena), loses both of his 
   hands while performing a slam-dunk during practice (thanks to a ring 
   of razor wire put around the hoop by the cackling, basketball-masked 
   psycho), Coach Cherry still doesn't put Stan in the game, much to the 
   disappointment of Stan, Becky and Stan's J.R. &quot;Bob&quot; 
   Dobbs-like father (Bill Saddler), but the coach comes up with a new 
   play for his players called the &quot;King Lear&quot; (<B>Player</B>: 
   &quot;Coach, why is it called the King Lear?&quot; <B>Coach</B>: 
   &quot;Because it's a great play!&quot;). Dean Marks pressures Coach 
   Cherry not to lose the game or else he will lose his job, but when 
   player Joseph Krunch (Michael Burns) is blown-up with a basketball 
   bomb (complete with lit fuse!), wisecracking cop Danny Gibson 
   (Travalena yet again) and black partner Mel Glover (Sherwood Kendall) 
   are put on the case (at this time, I switched from smoking pot to 
   popping amyl nitrate, if only for the inane Gibson/Glover <B><A HREF="lethal_weapon_1987.htm">LETHAL
    WEAPON</A></B> [1987] reference). To make an extremely long and 
   unfunny story short, more players end up dead, Stan becomes the main 
   suspect and then become a player (winning the game), the killer is 
   unmasked and I became a hopeless heroin junkie. Thanks, Code

   - 1970; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Zombie Nightmare">ZOMBIE NIGHTMARE</A></B> 
   - 1986) and written by Maurice Thevenet (not surprisingly, his only 
   film credit), is so unfunny, it may be one of the worst comedies ever 
   made (consider it the anti-comedy comedy). About 80% of the film is a 
   showcase for Fred Travalena's impressions (he even does Rod Steiger 
   and Michael Jackson!), but nearly everything he does here falls 
   flatter than a ten year-old girl's chest. This film's idea of funny 
   is having everyone ask Coach Cherry, &quot;Can I have a word with 
   you?&quot; and him replying with single word answers like 
   &quot;Poodle&quot;, &quot;Capitalism&quot; and 
   &quot;Aphrodisiac&quot;. There are also cheap &quot;Master Bates&quot;
    jokes, idiotic lines like &quot;His loss may be your game!&quot; and 
   grade-school gore, complete with superimposed words on-screen like 
   &quot;P-O-WWW!!&quot; (ala the old <B><A HREF="batman_1966.htm">BATMAN</A></B> 
   60's TV series) whenever the masked killer murders someone (it's done 
   to cover-up the transition of the gore effects, since the film's 
   paltry budget can't afford to show someone getting their hands cut 
   off, being blown-up or, in one case, getting shot!). <B>NIGHT OF THE DRIBBLER</B>

   never seems to end and strangles her while a group of people watch

   this from an isolation tank; she is part of a dream interpretation

    death, Doc sends his subjects to a house in the middle of the 
   &quot;Valley Of Fear&quot;, a section of the desert that contains a 
   long-closed mine where UFOs and other strange phenomena have been 
   reported for centuries. Doc sends along the musclebound Dean (Brian 
   Thompson; <B><A HREF="cobra_1986.htm">COBRA</A></B> - 1986) to act as 
   their driver and bodyguard (Dean purposely runs over a rabbit while 
   driving the van to their destination, explaining to the others, who 
   are sickened by his callous and cruel act, that &quot;the highway's 
   mine!&quot;). After changing a flat tire and buying peaches from a 
   facially deformed female fruit peddler, our group finally makes it to 
   their destination: A strange house that has partially collapsed into 
   the mine (Kim calls it &quot;The world's biggest basement.&quot;). 
   After dropping everyone off at the house, Dean leaves to do some 
   business and meets the retarded gatekeeper, Wendall (Tom Dugan; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#PerfectVictims1988">PERFECT

   sarcastically replies, &quot;You don't drink the water, do you?&quot; 
   (The water is reportedly contaminated by some unknown and 
   unclassified substance). Now the film gets really strange. Doc and 
   his subjects set up some electronic equipment in the house (which is 
   riddled with secret passages) and hold a s&eacute;ance, where doors 
   slam repeatedly, the temperature falls to freezing and a worm-like 
   creature comes out of the chimney.&nbsp; It turns out that everything 
   but the ectoplasmic worm was rigged by Doc to elicit fear responses 
   from the group, but they have also seem to have awakened what Doc 
   calls &quot;a demonic entity with the power to project 
   hallucinations.&quot; Is this also part of Doc's mysterious plan for 
   getting his subjects to accept death or is something really 
   paranormal going on here? No, really, I wish someone would tell me, 
   because what happens next is some of the most confusing (albeit gory, 
   gooey and bug-ridden) sequences in 80's horror film history, as the 
   subjects begin to die horrible, strange deaths and the film's closing 
   shot seems to suggest that this whole film was someone's bad dream

   After the unexpected success of <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#EnterTheNinja">ENTER

   (1983) and this one, a strange and entertaining mixture of martial 
   arts and horror genres. The film opens with a seemingly 
   indestructible ninja killing a millionaire industrialist, his 
   girlfriend and several bodyguards on a golf course before leading the 
   police on a chase, where he kills numerous cops (as well as 
   destroying a police helicopter) before being gunned-down by several 
   officers (we see all the officers' faces in close-up, as well as one 
   cop whose face is obscured by the sun, so we know that their lives 
   will be in danger later on), The mortally wounded ninja (he has been 
   riddled with over 50 bullets and shotgun blasts) manages to escape in 
   a puff of smoke and stumbles into the desert, where telephone line 
   repairwoman Christie (Lucinda Dickey; <B><A HREF="cheerleader_camp_1987.htm">CHEERLEADER
    CAMP</A></B> - 1988) offers him help, but instead is attacked by the 
   ninja and then possessed by his spirit after accepting his samurai 
   sword. The pretty Christie then begins having visions of all those 
   officers' faces and begins killing them one-by-one while possessed by 
   the ninja and then has no memory of committing the murders when she 
   wakes up (The first clue Christie should have<A HREF="ninja_3_the_domination_1984.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ninja iii the domination vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="177" HEIGHT="323" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   known something was wrong was when she suddenly has knowledge of 
   martial arts and beats the snot out of a street gang when they 
   threaten to rape her). Christie begins dating persistent street cop 
   Billy Secord (Jordan Bennett) when he refuses to take no for an 
   answer (He follows her to her aerobics class and shortly afterwards 
   he's licking V8 juice off her bare breasts!) and, wouldn't you know 
   it, Billy's partner is one of the cops involved in gunning-down the 
   ninja. As Christie's behavior becomes more bizarre (the possession 
   scenes are simply priceless, as the samurai sword floats in mid-air 
   [on a visible wire] and Christie travels to the dead ninja's secret 
   cave to grab some weapons and don his ninja outfit) and more cops end 
   up dead, including Billy's partner, the sudden appearance of eye patch-wearing
    Master Ninja Yamada (Sho Kosugi) arriving in town from Japan can 
   only mean one thing: An eventual showdown between him and the 
   possessed Christie. Billy grows more concerned with Christie's 
   demeanor, such as her sudden interest in Japanese culture and her 
   &quot;black-outs&quot;, so he takes Christie to Miyashima (James 
   Hong; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Jitters">THE JITTERS</A></B> - 
   1988), a phony expert on Japanese possession, who chains Christie up 
   at the waist and performs a ritual over her body. A totally surprised 
   Miyashima is not prepared for the result (think <B><A HREF="exorcist.htm">THE
    EXORCIST</A></B> [1973] on steroids) and warns Billy that Christie 
   is possessed by a &quot;Black Ninja&quot; and &quot;only a ninja can 
   destroy a ninja.&quot; I think we can all see where this is headed, 
   but the question still remains: Who is the officer whose face was 
   obscured by the sun? Could it possibly be Billy and will the 
   possessed Christie kill him?&nbsp; This totally absurd martial

   Fuck?!?&quot; moments, you can't help but enjoy yourself. There are 
   plenty of moments to relish here, especially Christie's <B>EXORCIST</B>-like
    transformation in Miyashima's shop, where she spins around like a 
   wound-up propellor on a toy airplane, while her face and hair get all 
   spooky and she starts speaking in tongues. Another outrageous scene 
   is the possessed Christie's slaughter of several police officers at a 
   cop's funeral. Watching cops being killed at an officer's funeral is 
   one of the strangest sights I have ever seen in a film. But my 
   favorite scene, bar none, is when Christie tries to fight off one 
   instance of possession by (get this) aerobic dancing at a furious 
   pace! If you aren't laughing hysterically at this sequence, I can 
   guarantee that you don't have a humorous bone in your entire body. 
   Think <B><A HREF="flashdance_1983.htm">FLASHDANCE</A></B> (1983) by 
   way of a Solid Gold Dancer high on PCP. This film has it all: Bloody 
   deaths (most by sword impalement of some kind), martial arts fights 
   (choreographed by Sho Kosugi), gravity-defying stunts, car crashes, 
   Lucinda Dickey in the nude and plenty of optical and laser effects 
   (including Christie being scanned by an arcade console game called 
   Bouncer, a real prototype game system that was never mass produced). 
   This is one of those films that restores your faith in American 
   action films. Unfortunately, this was the last in the series, as 
   Yoram/Globus and Cannon Films went in a different direction (but not 
   any less enjoyable), making action films starring Michael Dudikoff,

   Billed as a modern day fairy tale, I believe it is more about the 
   miracles of life and death. In what can only be described as an 
   alternate universe, the film first takes take place in New York 
   (Manhattan has been bought by an entertainment company) where 
   Beatrice (Sarah Polley of <B><A HREF="dawn_of_the_dead_2004.htm">DAWN 
   OF THE DEAD</A></B> - 2004) works as a gofer for TV news bigwig and 
   unfeeling The Boss (the always entertaining <A HREF="no_such_thing_2001.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/no such thing vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="105" HEIGHT="193" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>Helen
    Mirren). When Beatrice finds out that her fiance is missing in 
   Iceland covering a story, she asks The Boss to let her go find out 
   what really happened. The plane that Beatrice is on crashes into the 
   ocean and she is the only survivor. With nearly every bone in her 
   body broken and nearly no chance of walking again, Beatrice undergoes 
   an experimental procedure with the help of kindly Dr. Anna (Julia 
   Christie) which lets her walk again. Beatrice then goes to Iceland 
   where she finds a monster (Robert John Burke of <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Dust Devil">DUST
    DEVIL</A></B> - 1992; <B><A HREF="thinner_1996.htm">THINNER</A></B> 
   - 1996 and <B><A HREF="hide_and_seek_2005.htm">HIDE AND SEEK</A></B> 
   - 2005) who speaks perfect English, breathes fire and wants her to 
   destroy him. Even after discovering that he has killed her fiance, 
   Beatrice cannot find herself to kill the beast. (She does pump a slug 
   into his stomach but it has no effect. The monster then points the 
   gun at his head and pulls the trigger and it also has no effect!) The 
   monster confesses to Beatrice that he is immortal (he has seen 
   mountains decay), is an alcoholic, insomniac and the only one of his 
   kind in the world. The only person able to destroy him is Dr. Artaud 
   (Baltasar Kormakur), who the monster wants Beatrice to find to end 
   his misery. The only way Beatrice will do this is if the monster 
   accompanies her in the search, which leads back to New York. To give 
   away any more of the plot would be to destroy the film as it is one 
   of the most humanistic portrayals of good and evil (and what defines 
   them) to be portrayed in films. Who would have thought that this 
   fertile gem would come from Long Island director Hal Hartley, who 
   mainly does romantic dramas (He also did the haunting music score 
   here). The use of authentic locations and actors in Iceland greatly 
   enhances the drama and Burke is a hoot as the monster (makeup 
   courtesy of Mark Rappaport), spewing diatribes and downing massive 
   amounts of alcohol. Though short on blood and gore, that's not the 
   point of this film. The real point is how the public views you and 
   how long the entertainment industry (including the news division) can 
   keep you in the spotlight before they chew you up and spit you out. I 
   guess it's not an alternate universe after all. This did get a 
   theatrical release and many good reviews but bombed at the box 
   office. I believe the normal viewing audience will let most of the 
   parables drift right over their heads. Don't let this happen to you. 
   This is a masterpiece of weird (but true) cinema. As Dr. Artaud says:

   (1983) -</B> The French, they are a funny race. This ultra-low-budget 
   French horror cheapie opens with a family pulling their car over to 
   the side of the road so Dad can take a pee. While Dad is draining the 
   lizard, Mom gets out to stretch her legs and small daughter Letricia 
   and the family dog go to play in the woods for a few moments. Poor 
   little Leticia is immediately axed in the chest by a limbering 
   leather mask and wool cap-wearing backwoods creep known as Ogroff 
   (director Norbert Georges Moutier) and he drags her body away by her 
   feet. When Dad goes to look for her, Ogroff chops off his head with 
   the axe as Dad's headless body is able to walk to the side of the 
   road before collapsing. Mom runs away from Ogroff and is able to flag 
   down a car, but a circus clown gets out, yells at her (&quot;Walking 
   does you good...What a stupid bitch!&quot;), gets back in his car and 
   speeds away without her (I told you the French were a funny race. Not 
   &quot;ha! ha!&quot; funny, just funny in the head). Mom continues to 
   run away from Ogroff until she comes to a fork in the road (hey, what 
   about the dog?). Should she go left, right or straight ahead? She 
   decides to follow a man who is walking a bike with a cart attached to 
   it and when she catches up to<A HREF="ogroff_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ogroff french vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   him, she discovers that the man is Ogroff (What The Fuck?!?) and the 
   cart contains the corpse of her daughter. Ogroff ties Mom's hands 
   behind her back, but he apparently failed knot-tying in the Boy 
   Scouts (He was probably more into drinking wine and smoking 
   cigarettes during his childhood!), because Mom escapes and runs 
   further into the woods, right into, you guessed it, Ogroff's shack. 
   Mom goes inside and finds that the place is decorated in early <B><A HREF="texas_chainsaw_massacre_1974.htm">TEXAS
    CHAINSAW MASSACRE</A></B> (1974) fashion, with bones hanging from 
   the ceiling, nude centerfolds plastered on the walls and bloody human 
   remains everywhere. Ogroff recaptures Mom as she comes outside, 
   chains her to a wooden post and cuts out her tongue to stop her from 
   screaming and feeds it to the family dog (Wait a second. How did he 
   have time to bring the dog to his shack before Mom arrived there? Mon 
   dieu, my head is spinning!). Ogroff then saws and chops little 
   Leticia's body into pieces on a tree stump in full view of Mom and 
   feeds some of the flesh to something he keeps behind a trap door in 
   his basement. Mom's sister sets out to find her when the police won't 
   help (Too late, though, as Ogroff has already chopped Mom into little 
   pieces) and the rest of the film is a series of bloody set pieces, as 
   Ogroff and Sis chop and stab their way through a bunch of forest 
   dwellers before meeting each other. Sis accidentally releases a bunch 
   of zombies (some dressed in World War II military uniforms) that 
   Ogroff has kept in his basement (so that's what they were!). For some 
   unknown reason, the dead begin rising from their graves and Sis must 
   flee from them as well as Ogroff, who has now jumped on a motorcycle 
   and is giving chase, axe in hand. What's the French word for 
   &quot;overkill&quot;? Like the French during wartime, I surrendered 
   myself to the fact that there's no point in putting up a fight, as I 
   let the film run its course until it finally ended.&nbsp; There is 
   not much to recommend about this very cheap French horror film 
   besides some early gore effects from Benoit Lestang, who committed 
   suicide shortly after finishing the tough-to-handle make-up effects 
   to the French/Canadian horror film <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Martyrs">MARTYRS</A></B> 
   (2008). Director/producer/screenwriter/actor Norbert Georges Moutier 
   (usually credited as &quot;N.G. Mount&quot;), a French fanzine 
   publisher, decided he wanted to make a horror film and this was his 
   first effort. Unfortunately, it is amateur hour in nearly every 
   department, from acting (people don't act here; they mug for the 
   camera); editing (there are so many unneeded jump cuts here that I 
   would say the editor was either blindfolded or drunk); sound (this 
   was shot without sound and was badly looped later); photography (lots 
   of medium and long shots with static camera placement that go on for 
   far too long); music (a droning synthesizer score); and screenplay 
   (there's really no story here, but if you want to see a masked killer 
   masturbating with his axe while lying in bed, then this is the film 
   for you!). The only real reason for watching this film is for 
   Lestang's plentiful gore effects, which includes beheadings, 
   dismemberments, face slashings, stabbings, impalements and 
   cannibalism. Otherwise, there's not much of a point in watching <B>OGROFF</B> 
   (also known as <B><A HREF="mad_mutilator_1983.htm">MAD MUTILATOR</A></B>),
    as it reminds me of someone's amateur backyard film they made over a 
   weekend with some friends. The late Howard Vernon (who must have owed 
   someone a mighty big favor) appears in a cameo as a vampire in the 
   film's &quot;surprise&quot; finale (and he gets top billing!).

   (1983), Sole's <B><A HREF="pandemonium_1982b.htm">PANDEMONIUM</A></B>,
    written by Richard Whitley and Jaime Klein, relies too much on jokey 
   names (Salt &amp; Pepe, played by Izabella Telezynska and David L. 
   Lander; Crystal &amp; China, played by twins Candi &amp; Randi 
   Brough; the cheerleaders rhyming names), lame sex jokes; lots of 
   toilet humor (with fart noises, of course) and bloodless killings. 
   Since the film is rated PG, there is also a complete lack of nudity 
   (even during a strip poker game!), which is a crying shame 
   considering the cheerleader premise. There are a few original laughs 
   to be had here, such as Jarrett turning his victims into opulent 
   pieces of furniture (His psychiatrist says, &quot;Why, yes, I have 
   one of his victims in my bedroom!&quot;) or Bob (who is mostly shown 
   as an animatronic horse head) showing up in unusual places, like the 
   back seat of a car or standing behind his own police desk, but most 
   of the humor falls flatter than a ten year-old girl's chest, even 
   though a cast of seasoned pros give it their all (including cameos by 
   Sydney Lassick, Gary Allen, Lenny Montana, Tab Hunter, Edie McClurg, 
   Eileen Brennan [who decided to take the pseudonym &quot;A 
   Friend&quot;], Phil Hartman and Pat Ast). I have no doubt in my mind 
   that studio interference hampered Alfred Sole from making the type of 
   movie he wanted, which is probably why he gave up on directing after 
   making this. That's too bad, because the man obviously has talent if 
   you let him rip. Here's to hoping that he tries his hand at directing

    The film opens with Dr. Herschel (Sacha Pitoeff; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Inferno1980">INFERNO</A></B> 
   - 1980) and his adult son Patrick (Gianni Dei; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#SexOfWitch1973">SEX
    OF THE WITCH</A></B> - 1973) on the side of the road, their car has 
   broken down and will not start. Patrick tries to flag down an 
   oncoming bus, but instead of stopping, someone throws a heavy bottle 
   out the window and it hits Patrick hard in his face, putting him into 
   an irreversible coma. The bus keeps going down the road, seemingly 
   oblivious as to what has just happened.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then watch as several people arrive at Dr. Herschel's 
   clinic/resort, all of them personally invited there by Dr. Herschel 
   and all of them harboring a deep dark secret all their own (I know 
   what you are thinking and you are right). The guests include Stella 
   Randolph (Maria Angela Giordan; <B><A HREF="#BurialGround1980">BURIAL GROUND</A></B> 
   - 1980), the mysterious Peter Suniak (John Benedy; <B><A HREF="kill_django_kill_first_1971.htm">KILL
    DJANGO, KILL FIRST</A></B> - 1971), politician Lyndon Cough (Franco 
   Silva; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Spasmo">SPASMO</A></B> - 1974) and 
   his oversexed wife Cheryl (Carmen Russo; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#RingDarkness77/79">RING
    OF DARKNESS</A></B> - 1977/1979) and, finally, David Davis (Paolo 
   Giusti; <B><A HREF="dirty_hands_1975.htm">DIRTY HANDS</A></B> - 
   1975), who arrives late and stumbles upon two vicious German 
   Shepards, wondering why Dr. Herschel would keep such deadly dogs (a 
   question that is never answered). Dr. Herschel's new assistant, Lydia 
   Grant (Andrea Belfiore; <B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#AdventHercules1985">THE
    ADVENTURES OF HERCULES</A></B> - 1985), shows the guests to their 
   rooms and apologizes for the lack of help, as this is the resort's 
   off-season, but she assures them that all of their needs will be 
   taken care of.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As all the guests are sunning themselves by the pool (Stella has no 
   problem parading around topless), Cheryl asks her husband why Stella 
   and Peter are staring at them so intently and wonders if they don't 
   like them. Lyndon tells her just to ignore them. Back in their room, 
   Lyndon wonders why Dr. Herschel invited them to this resort and why 
   Peter hides a gun on his body. He knows Dr. Herschel is aware of his 
   crooked political past, where an &quot;incident&quot; nearly put him 
   in prison for life (He is also an alcoholic, keeping a pint <A HREF="j&amp;b_scotch_whiskey_in_italian_films.htm">bottle
    of J&amp;B Scotch</A>, Italy's favorite beverage, on his person, 
   which he drinks in wild abandon when no one is looking). We then 
   discover that Lyndon hasn't been intimate with his wife for years, 
   even at the resort they have separate bedrooms, which is why Cheryl 
   acts like a tramp, hitting on every man she sees and embarrassing 
   Lyndon every chance she gets (We see her walking around in a bra that 
   shows off her nipples!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At dinner, Dr. Herschel welcomes his guests to the resort, telling 
   them that while they are staying here, he will give them all a free 
   medical check-up if they so desire, but they all turn him down. He 
   then tells them that the only area off-limits to them is his clinic, 
   where we previously saw a trio of his patients with scarred 
   physiques, tubes coming out of their bodies, as they lay on hospital 
   beds next to each other. Patrick, on the other hand, has a room of 
   his own, where his father dotes on him. It is obvious that Patrick 
   has the power of telekinesis and also has the power to control 
   people. He knows about Lydia and is taken by her, so he makes her 
   walk to his room in a trance-like state one night, but Dr. Herschel 
   catches and scolds her, saying he told her this place was off-limits, 
   even for her, and it better not happen again.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next morning, Lyndon gets up early to take a swim in the pool, 
   but Patrick makes the water boil, cooking Lyndon's body. When Cheryl 
   discovers her husband's boiled body, she screams and everyone comes 
   running to her. Dr. Herschel sedates Cheryl and puts her in her room. 
   He then tells David and Peter that the condition of Lyndon's body was 
   caused by his alcoholism (!) and there have been cases, although 
   rare, where the same thing has happened to other alcoholics. The 
   question soon becomes: Does Dr. Herschel know about Patrick's powers 
   and is he using his son to kill these people? If you answered yes to 
   both of those questions, you would be correct. A short time later, 
   David tells Stella that he once left a crime scene a few years ago 
   where three people died, but he doesn't elaborate. Is it possible 
   that the other guests are also guilty of crimes they don't want to 
   talk about? Count on it. But why do Patrick and Dr. Herschel want 
   them dead for those crimes? (It doesn't take a rocket scientist to 
   figure this out).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While Cheryl is sedated and unconscious in her room, Peter sneaks in 
   and begins rifling through her belongings, pocketing a letter he 
   found in an envelope in her purse. It seems like he found what he was 
   looking for, but, at this time, the viewer has no idea what's in that 
   letter. We will find out a short time later in the film. During 
   dinner, a drunk Stella (carrying a bottle of J&amp;B) comes to the 
   table with her robe wide open, naked to the world for everyone to see 
   and says to Cheryl that everyone got the same letter to this 
   &quot;phony vacation&quot;, the only difference in the letters being 
   the crimes they committed, saying Peter was a drug dealer and she was 
   a street-walking prostitute (it does explain her exhibitionist 
   behavior). She asks Cheryl what crime she is guilty of and she says 
   she has no idea what she is talking about. Stella calls her a 
   &quot;lying bitch&quot;, which leads to a catfight (While they are 
   rolling on the floor, Cheryl says to Stella, &quot;Get away from me, 
   get away before I catch syphilis from you!&quot;). David and Peter 
   break it up, David telling Peter to handle the situation further 
   because &quot;screaming women make me nervous&quot;, so Peter drags 
   Stella back to her room, kicking and screaming (Lydia then enters the 
   dining room and acts like everything is normal. It could be because 
   Patrick just tried to telepathically rape her!). Dr. Herschel, who 
   just witnessed everything that just happened, sits quietly at the 
   head of the dinner table, a sly smirk on his face. At Stella's room, 
   Peter pours Stella's hidden bottle of J&amp;B down the bathroom sink 
   and gets a bath ready for her. Stella comes on to Peter, inviting him 
   to stay the night, but he says to her, &quot;I usually bang women, 
   not whiskey bottles&quot;, so she calls him an asshole and says he 
   wants to sleep with Cheryl, which he denies. Stella then gets into he 
   bubble bath and says, &quot;Don't you like me any more?&quot; When 
   Peter answers &quot;Maybe&quot;, Stella shoots back, &quot;The drugs 
   turned you into a faggot!&quot;, so Peter says, &quot;Then die alone, 
   bitch!&quot; and leaves the room. These two people are perfect for 
   each other (Hey, assholes need lovin', too!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Stella then goes to David's room and hits on him. David is not 
   interested, because we previously saw him playing with a deck of 
   tarot cards trying to tell his fortune and the final card he drew was 
   the Death card (A portend of things to come?). Stella lies on David's 
   bed and invites him to join her, David asking her why she spared him 
   at the dinner table. She says, &quot;It's simple. Because in the end, 
   you will have to defend me.&quot; She then puts the moves on David, 
   but he pushes her away, saying, &quot;No, Stella. I don't like 
   garbage, especially a gorilla's garbage&quot; (referring to Peter). 
   Stella calls him a coward and they get into a slap fight (!). When 
   David leaves the room, he tells Stella, &quot;If you're still here in 
   ten minutes, I'll kill you!&quot; Something tells me that David is 
   not into women, both figuratively and literally.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Slightly retarded clinic worker Meg (Anna Veneziano) tells David 
   that he's in a restricted area, so he asks her if she knows anything 
   about Lyndon's death. She says no, but strange things have been going 
   on here lately. She then kisses David on the lips and he doesn't pull 
   away, but he gives her a strange look as he walks away. Meg then 
   looks down and picks up a Death tarot card. Did David drop it or is 
   it a hint from Patrick that David is next on his list? We don't have 
   to wait long for the answer, because as David is walking on the 
   grounds at night, we hear theremin music on the soundtrack (a sonic 
   hint that Patrick is using his powers). David senses that something 
   is wrong (the wind is blowing, but only in certain areas, ignoring 
   the laws of physics), so he runs and hides, finding himself in the 
   courtyard where the dogs are chained-up, only they are not barking, 
   they are whimpering. In the middle of the courtyard is a well, but an 
   iron gate blocks the well's hole. David then sees Patrick's eyes 
   coming towards him (a cheap optical effect, but still effective) and 
   the iron gate opens by itself, a hook on a chain rising to the top of 
   the well. The hook then pierces David's neck and he is suspended over 
   the well, dead, blood gushing from his neck. A drunk Stella stumbles 
   outside, hearing the dogs howling, and discovers David's bloody, 
   hanging body (I just gotta hear Dr. Herschel's explanation for this 
   death!). Stella runs away screaming, stopping by the resort's giant 
   fountain to splash water on her face. She should have kept running, 
   because she sees Patrick's eyes coming towards her (uh, oh!) and we 
   cut to Peter sleeping, awoken by the howling dogs. Stella runs for 
   her life, hiding out in an unused kitchen at the resort. She opens up 
   a refrigerator and finds a splayed monkey (!) inside it. The lights 
   go out and what happens next is the film's highlight. It is also very 
   hard to watch. A large metal spike floats in the air and enters 
   Stella's vagina (nothing is left to the imagination) and exits out 
   her mouth! (I know she wanted to get laid, but this is ridiculous!). 
   Peter, Cheryl and Lydia hear her screams and find Stella's dead body, 
   looking like a human shish-kabob. Dr. Herschel says Lyndon's death is 
   explainable, but David and Stella's deaths are beyond human logic. 
   Peter, on the other hand, calls all three deaths murders, but Dr. 
   Herschel says who could have done such a thing? Either he's lying or 
   he doesn't know about Patrick's powers (I'm betting on the former). 
   Dr. Herschel tells Peter that he has already called the police and a 
   detective will be here tomorrow morning.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Patrick then once again calls for Lydia, who shows up in his room 
   and strips naked, gyrating sexually around his comatose body, using 
   one of his bedposts like a sex toy. She then lies down on the couch 
   in his room and Patrick telepathically makes love to her (it looks 
   like a porn film, but without the &quot;money shot&quot;). Peter 
   tells Cheryl that he is leaving the resort and she begs him to take 
   her with him. He gives her five minutes to get her stuff and meet him 
   at his car. We then see Cheryl putting her stuff in the backseat of 
   Peter's car and the automatic window starts to go up on its own, 
   decapitating her! Peter then gets into his car, but when he sees 
   Cheryl's decapitated head in the backseat, all the doors lock and the 
   car fills up with smoke, killing him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then finally discover that Dr. Herschel knows about his son's 
   powers (Patrick feeds off the energy of Dr. Herschel's three other 
   patients, <A HREF="patrick_still_lives_1980.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/patrick still lives italy poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="209" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>slowly
    draining them of life and scarring their bodies). He tells Patrick 
   not to stop, there's one more person to kill, but who can it be? All 
   the guests are dead. We then discover that the person in the bus that 
   threw the bottle that put Patrick in a permanent coma could only have 
   been one of six people on the bus. It took Dr. Herschel years to find 
   out their identities and to put his plan of action in the works. Five 
   of the people were the guests he invited to the resort and the sixth 
   person is a new hire. That's right, it is Lydia.&nbsp; But the 
   question soon becomes: Will Patrick listen to his father and kill the 
   woman he loves or will he do something else? If you want to know the 
   answer, you will have to watch the film. I have to leave something 
   for you to discover, don't I? (Hint: Love is everything, except for 
   fatherly love).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This is a really perverse film, chock-full of full-frontal nudity

   favorite when product placement comes into play, but this film swims

   film as he possibly can (even the dogs rip off Meg's clothes before 
   mauling her to death!). If you are expecting to discover who actually 
   threw the bottle at Patrick, you will be bitterly disappointed, but 
   does it really even matter? Apparently not, but this film is a sleazy 
   treat, full of near-pornographic nudity and sex, as well as some very

   (1972) -</B> This is the first directorial effort from Alan Rudolph, 
   a trippy counterculture horror film that displays touches of 
   Rudolph's quirkiness that would blossom much later in his arthouse 
   films, including <B><A HREF="alan_rudolph_arthouse_films_of_the_80s.htm">CHOOSE
    ME</A></B> (1984), <B><A HREF="alan_rudolph_arthouse_films_of_the_80s.htm">TROUBLE

    IN HEAVEN</A></B> (1987). The film opens with hippie guitar-playing 
   troubadour Neil (Carl Crow) singing a ballad while walking through a 
   deserted, windswept town and then sitting down and talking directly 
   into the camera. He begins narrating a story that begins three years 
   earlier, when he took a job as a driver/assistant to Professor 
   Kilrenny (Victor Izay; <B><A HREF="billy_jack_1971.htm">BILLY JACK</A></B> 
   - 1971), who is looking for an ancient Indian village somewhere in 
   the Mexican desert. As the Professor sets out on his own, Neil builds 
   base camp and smokes some weed. The Professor finds a skeleton lying 
   amongst a field of some strange red plants and runs back to Neil to 
   help him retrieve it. When Neil gets close to the skeleton, he has 
   visions of a horribly-scarred head and when he helps the Professor 
   load the skeleton on the bac<A HREF="premonition_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/premonition-alan rudolph vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>k
    of the pickup truck and they drive away, Neil has another vision 
   which causes him to crash the truck and destroy the skeleton. The 
   experience forces Neil to give up drugs for three years (although 
   he's smoking a joint while narrating this tale). The story then skips 
   ahead two years, where Neil and his best friend Baker (Winfrey Hester 
   Hill) join a rock band and get a gig at a bar, but Neil's strange 
   behavior gets him and Baker kicked out of the band. Neil and Baker 
   join fellow musician Andy (Tim Ray), who also suffers from some 
   serious nightmares, and form a musical trio. They head for San 
   Francisco on their motorcycles (leading the way for several <B><A HREF="easy_rider_1969.htm">EASY
    RIDER</A></B> [1969]-like vignettes) in hopes of hitting the big 
   time, taking up residence in an old abandoned farmhouse. Andy 
   immediately has a bad case of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu and tells Neil 
   and Baker that something bad happened here (He says, &quot;I saw the 
   Devil here. She was here!&quot; to which Baker jokingly replies, 
   &quot;She couldn't have been here. I left her at home!&quot;). Pretty 
   soon, both Neil and Andy begin sharing the same nightmares, which 
   involves a smoke-shrouded demon, three hippie chicks in a field and 
   Andy getting decapitated. The question soon becomes: Are these 
   nightmares or prophetic visions? When Andy begins smoking the leaves 
   of the red plant (the same red plants that were growing around the 
   skeleton in the Mexico desert), he begins to unravel the mystery, 
   much to Neil's dismay. A chance encounter with Professor Kilrenny and 
   a rock concert at the farmhouse results in Neil and Adam discovering 
   the truth about their nightmares and possibly unleashing a force that 
   will continue to kill for years to come.&nbsp; <B><A HREF="premonition_1972c.htm">PREMONITION</A></B> 
   is a confusing and dated, yet, somehow, very involving horror film. 
   Sure, it's full of drug references, dated hippy dialogue and trippy 
   visuals (including freak-outs and weird camera angles), but 
   director/producer/writer Alan Rudolph (whose next film would be the 
   god-awful <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Barn Naked Dead">BARN OF THE 
   NAKED DEAD</A></B> [1974] and would later make the interesting cattle 
   mutilation/conspiracy thriller <B><A HREF="endangered_species_1982.htm">ENDANGERED
    SPECIES</A></B> [1982]) spins a highly involving yarn that rewards 
   the patient viewer. Rudolph tosses-in every visual trick in the book, 
   including flashbacks-within-flashbacks, subliminal editing, solarized 
   shots of hippie chicks dancing, psychedelic trip sequences with lots 
   of colorful gel lighting and a very early example of Steadicam work. 
   While the film is not very bloody (just a quick shot of a 
   decapitation, a burned corpse and bloody head wounds), it is 
   absolutely creepy in spots (especially the shared nightmare) and the 
   droning electronic score that accompanies those sequences are sure to 
   raise some goosebumps. This is an interesting and rarely-seen first 
   feature from a director whose acclaim has come due to his odd choices 
   in subject matter. To the untrained eye, this film may seem to be 
   nothing more than a minor hippie drug horror flick, but auteur 
   Rudolph is actually revealing much more to the viewer. Like most of

    KICKBOXER: THE DARK ANGEL</A><A NAME="PsychoKickboxer"></A> 
   (1992/1997) -</B> Kickboxer Alex Hunter (Curtis Bush) seemingly has 
   it all: His kickboxing career is taking off, his girlfriend Julia 
   (Stephanie Godfrey) has just accepted his marriage proposal and his 
   father, Chief of Detectives Alan Hunter (George James), is about to 
   put away crime lord Hawthorne (Tom Story) for a long time. 
   Hawthorne's not having any of that (He's so mean, instead of cutting 
   off an underling's pinky finger as a sign of loyalty, he cuts-off the 
   poor schmuck's entire hand!), so he has his thugs kidnap Alex, Alan 
   and Julia as they walk out of a restaurant and brings them to a 
   warehouse, where a tied-up Alex is forced to witness his father 
   getting his head blown-off with a shotgun (a very gory effect) and 
   then watch Julia being gang-raped, followed by having her throat cut. 
   Alex is shot, beaten and left for dead, but he is saved by black 
   wheelchair-bound Vietnam veteran Joshua (Rod Suiter), who nurses Alex 
   back to health and turns him into the &quot;Dark Angel&quot;, the 
   psycho kickboxer of the title (We soon find out it was Hawthorne who 
   put Joshua in the wheelchair, not the Vietnam War). Alex, who is 
   wanted by the police in connection with his father and Julia's 
   deaths, thanks to evidence <A HREF="psycho_kickboxer_1997.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/psycho kickboxer-canvas of blood dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>planted
    at the scene by Alan's crooked cop partner Harry O'Reilly (Ray 
   Brown), dons a black ninja outfit and begins cleaning-up the streets 
   of rapists and drug pushers, which begins to interfere with 
   Hawthorne's criminal enterprises. The cops put a bounty on the Dark 
   Angel's head and Alex gets more attention than he needs when he saves 
   tabloid reporter Cassie Wells (Kim Reynolds) from three rapists. 
   Cassie joins forces with private investigator Jack Cook (Rick Clark) 
   to discover the true identity of the Dark Angel so Cassie can get a 
   front page story and they both can split the reward. As Alex goes on 
   a bloody revenge spree, Hawthorne kidnaps Cassie, Jack and Joshua and 
   forces Alex to fight a series of increasingly more difficult 
   opponents in Hawthorne's nightclub. When Alex runs out of opponents, 
   he turns his attention towards Hawthorne's right-hand man, Hawk (Del 
   Potter), who slit Julia's throat in the beginning of the film, and 
   then Harry, while Joshua, (sans wheelchair), makes sure that 
   Hawthorne doesn't live to see tomorrow.&nbsp; This ultra-low-budget 
   actioner, directed/produced by Mardy South (his only directorial 
   credit) and written by Kathy Varner, took 14 months to film and 
   nearly five years to find a distributor, yet it is not nearly as 
   awful as it should be. Sure, some of the acting is sub-par, the sound 
   effects over-amped and the photography grainy, but the film has a 
   visceral energy that can't be denied and there is some extreme gore 
   on display here that is surprisingly well-done (and unusual in a 
   flick like this). The visceral energy comes courtesy of star Curtis 
   &quot;The Explosive Thin Man&quot; Bush, who was 5-time World 
   Kickboxing Champion and a professional middleweight boxer at the time 
   of this film's release. While he's not much of an actor (he's usually 
   plays a background extra on TV shows like <B><A HREF="lost_tv_series_2004-2010.htm">LOST</A></B> 
   [2004 - 2010]), his martial arts sequences are usually very well done 
   and violent as hell. This is the type of film where every rapist, 
   drug dealer and street scum has extensive martial arts experience, 
   which makes for highly improbable, yet entertaining, street fights. 
   My favorite scene comes when Alex saves a woman from a carjacking by 
   beating her attacker to a bloody pulp. The woman then becomes so 
   enraged, she starts her car and runs over her attacker's head, 
   squashing it like some ripe watermelon. It's scenes like this which 
   keeps the viewer totally off-balance and while I would never call <B><A HREF="psycho_kickboxer_1997b.htm">PSYCHO
    KICKBOXER</A></B> a good film by any stretch of the imagination 
   (it's anemic budget shines through in nearly every scene), I must say 
   that it was much better than I expected it to be. It's got 
   paraplegic-fu, a knife in the forehead, full-frontal female nudity 
   and bursts of graphic gore (although the DVD artwork, depicting Alex 
   kicking some guy's head completely off his shoulders in a geyser of 
   blood, appears nowhere in the film). You could do a lot worse and 
   probably have. Filmed entirely in Hampton Roads, Virginia using local 
   talent exclusively in front and behind the camera. Also starring 
   Frank Gagnano, George James and Andrew Peele. Originally released on 
   VHS by E.I. Independent Cinema and now available on DVD from 
   Shock-O-Rama Cinema as part of a double feature, with the equally

   (1968) -</B> Leonardo Ferri (Franco Nero; <B><A HREF="#ThirdEye1966">THE

   village in Venice and tells Flavia, against her wishes, that he wants 
   to live there because it is the perfect place for him to create. 
   Flavia rents the mansion for Leonardo and he and some workers, 
   including his new housekeeper<A HREF="quiet_place_in_the_country_1968.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/quiet place in the country blu-ray front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="263" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>

   large holes in one of the outside walls of the mansion were caused by 
   bullets shot from an American warplane during World War II, but why 
   is someone leaving a bouquet of freshly picked wildflowers at the 
   wall several times a week? Leonardo is determined (some would say 
   obsessed) to find out who and why they are doing this and it will 
   lead him to a supernatural mystery that will haunt him for the rest 
   of his life. How long that is depends on his actions.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Leonardo soon discovers that it wasn't just the wall that was shot 
   on that day in the early-1940's. Also shot and killed was 17-year-old 
   Wanda (Gabriella Grimaldi; <B><A HREF="johnny_hamlet_1968.htm">JOHNNY HAMLET</A></B> 
   - 1968), known to people in the village as the &quot;Little 
   Contessa.&quot; Leonardo believes the spirit of Wanda haunts the 
   mansion, as whenever Flavia pays him a visit, bad things happen to 
   her, like a ceiling collapsing on her, invisible hands trying to pull 
   her through a hole in the floor, a heavy bookcase nearly falling on 
   her and a hot water heater exploding why she is taking a shower, all 
   incidents which could have been fatal for her, but she manages to 
   escape harm. But she is so freaked out, she refuses to spend a night 
   in the mansion. One night, Leonardo has a nightmare where he sees his 
   new studio destroyed, but when he wakes up, he discovers that it 
   wasn't a nightmare at all. When Leonardo goes to Egle's bedroom to 
   see if she knows anything about the mess, he discovers that she has a 
   lover in there (Renato Menegotto), who is hiding under the bed and 
   Egle tells him it is her &quot;little brother&quot;! (Leonardo, of 
   course, doesn't believe her. We see him staring at Egle's breasts 
   several times in the film and one time he grabs her breast and she 
   doesn't put up much of a fight!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Leonardo discovers some facts about Wanda when he questions some 
   villagers at the local pub. All the men describe her as amazingly 
   beautiful, but all the women call her a &quot;whore&quot; and a 
   &quot;slut&quot;, saying Wanda would drop her clothes at the sight of 
   any man, handsome or ugly; further saying that she was a nymphomaniac 
   who had many male lovers at the same time. Leonardo also discovers 
   that Wanda's favorite color was red, so he has some workers 
   (including Egle and her &quot;little brother&quot;) paint the outside 
   columns of the mansion bright red, in hopes that Wanda would reveal 
   herself to him (I often wonder if this film is where Clint Eastwood 
   got the idea to &quot;paint the town red&quot; in <B><A HREF="high_plains_drifter_1973.htm">HIGH
    PLAINS DRIFTER</A></B> - 1973). Leonard believes that Wanda wants 
   him to live in this mansion permanently and rationalizes that she is 
   jealous of Flavia, which is why bad things happen to her every time 
   she is in the mansion. He may be right, but is it wise to tempt a 
   ghost? He will soon find out. Leonardo also discovers that Wanda's 
   mother (Madeleine Damien; <B><A HREF="day_of_the_jackal_1973.htm">THE 
   DAY OF THE JACKAL</A></B> - 1973) is still alive, so he goes to visit 
   her in hopes of finding out more about her daughter. The mother is 
   old, frail and penniless (pay close attention to how Leonardo sees 
   her in his twisted mind) and in one room she has a virtual monument 
   to her daughter, the walls and tables full of photos and memorabilia 
   of Wanda. She tells Leonardo to look in a box containing more photos 
   of Wanda, so he takes all of them, after dropping some money in the 
   box, and leaves, ignoring the mother's pleas for him to spend some 
   time with her because she never gets visitors.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Leonardo finds out that the man leaving flowers at the wall is 
   married butcher Attilio (Georges Geret; <B><A HREF="reason_to_live_a_reason_to_die_1972.htm">A
    REASON TO LIVE, A REASON TO DIE</A></B> - 1972), who tells Leonardo 
   about his affair with Wanda before she was killed (He tells Leonardo 
   he witnessed Wanda being shot by the warplane). He first met Wanda 
   when he was a teenager walking down a dirt road and she was driving 
   her car. She pulled up beside him and revealed that she was 
   completely naked (!) and from that moment on, they became lovers, 
   even though he knew that she had many other lovers, some of them his 
   friends, but she was so damn beautiful he couldn't help himself. He 
   shows Leonardo a secret small room in the mansion where they would 
   make love and tells him to pay close attention to the mirror in the 
   room. It's actually a two-way mirror and Attilio tells Leonardo he 
   can't prove it, but he believes that Wanda's mother watched them 
   having sex and Wanda was fully aware of it!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Wanda's spirit begins to haunt and tease Leonardo, wearing a red 
   dress and riding her bike inside the mansion. Leonardo's mind is so 
   fertile (He has Walter Mitty-like visions throughout the film, but 
   unlike Mitty, some of his visions are downright strange and bizarre), 
   we must figure out if Wanda is actually haunting him or if it's all 
   just in his mind. Leonardo invites the villagers to the mansion for a 
   party, only to reveal to Flavia that they are holding a s&eacute;ance 
   to contact Wanda. The male medium (an uncredited David Maunsell; <B><A HREF="action.htm#ApocalypseMercs1987">APOCALYPSE
    MERCENARIES</A></B> - 1987) contacts Wanda and an old pair of 
   scissors (which Leonardo keeps finding around the mansion) appears on 
   the table, pointing at Attilio. The table begins to move and bang, 
   telling the medium that Wanda does not want Attilio in the mansion. 
   Attilio accuses everyone of arranging this, calling them 
   &quot;clowns&quot;, saying that it happened many years ago and it is 
   not something to laugh about, as he storms out of the mansion.&nbsp; 
   What does Attilio mean by that? The spirit of Wanda then apparently 
   tries to strangle Flavia, so she orders everyone to get out of the 
   mansion immediately. But was it Wanda who tried to strangle her? If 
   you answered no, you would be correct. Has Leonardo finally lost his mind?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   horror, part mystery, part love story and 100% unique. There's 
   nothing quite like it, at least as far as I'm concerned. Filmed with 
   a late-'60s pop art sensibility (check out Leonardo's apartment in 
   the beginning of the film, where phrases like &quot;We have a 
   happening to go to at 6:00 pm&quot; are heard), this movie manages to 
   hold your complete attention, even though you are not sure what 
   direction it is heading. It's all thanks to Petri's keen sense on 
   where to place the camera and his off-kilter narrative, Ruggero 
   Mastroianni's (<B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#FlaviaTheHeretic74">FLAVIA

    AND ARMOUR</A></B> - 1983) rapid-fire editing (over a decade before 
   the &quot;MTV Generation&quot;) and Franco Nero's affecting 
   performance as a man dancing on the edge of madness. It just proves 
   why Franco was (and still is) an actor who was much in demand, not 
   only in Italian films, but in international productions as well. His 
   performance here is enthralling without a single false note, in a 
   role that would make many other actors fail miserably. Vanessa 
   Redgrave is also excellent as a woman who accepts Leonardo as a man 
   with many eccentricities, including reading porno magazines in front 
   of her and bouts of rough sex, but she literally rolls with the 
   punches until she discovers Leonardo's <A HREF="quiet_place_in_the_country_1968.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/quiet place in the country italy dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>true
    self and comes up with a plan of revenge that is not only 
   satisfying, it also ends the film. She and Leonardo are contrasting 
   personalities; Flavia loves electronic devices, but Leonardo abhors 
   them. When Flavia buys Leonardo a bunch of electronic appliances for 
   the mansion's ancient kitchen, Leonardo shows his displeasure by 
   using the dishwasher to clean his paintbrushes. When Leonardo is 
   accused of killing Flavia after the police find her bloody clothes in 
   an overturned refrigerator (one of Flavia's gifts to him), we 
   discover that a crazy artist is more profitable then a sane one, as 
   an asylum attendant (Leonardo has to spend the rest of his life in an 
   insane asylum) bribes Leonardo to create more new art by giving him 
   porno magazines and he collects the art and hands them over to a very 
   much alive Flavia, who has been making a mint with Leonardo's new 
   stuff (which looks like an abstract vagina!), while Leonardo watches 
   out of his asylum room's window. Flavia makes a remark that she is 
   almost jealous of Leonardo, living in such a lovely place and then 
   the film ends. The crazy opening and closing credits will make you 
   wonder if David Fincher's <B><A HREF="se7en_1995.htm">SE7EN</A></B>

   we are not sure if what we are seeing and hearing are real or part of 
   Leonardo's fractured mind. Some of the more outrageous visions 
   Leonardo has are his image of Wanda's mother, who he imagines as a 
   series of coffins, one of them sitting up (it must be seen to be 
   appreciated) and him not casting a reflection in the small room's 
   mirror, both of them surprising and twistedly humorous. I cannot

   tries to teach Doggie proper table etiquette, like serving tea, but

   clothes (Mom is also a terrible housekeeper since Dad disappeared two 
   months ago, as her apartment is full of cobwebs and rats, but we will

   goes to the apartment of photographer Mo Hsein-Sheng (Melvin Wong), 
   who has just finished snapping photos of her at a temple for an 
   advertising job. His apartment is full of grotesque artifacts and 
   statues, including a nasty-looking demon statue that he has just 
   stolen from the temple, and they both get drunk on champagne, 
   throw-up and pass out. The demon statue comes to life and rapes Shu 
   Ya on the bed (the demon is covered with pulsating pustules and is 
   quite the disgusting sight)<A HREF="rape_after_1985b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rape after hong kong vcd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="246" HEIGHT="299" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   while Mo is unconscious, passed-out on the coffee table. The 
   following morning, they both wake up as if nothing has happened, but 
   it is quite obvious by the worried looks on the monks at the temple 
   when they discover that the statue was stolen, that Shu Ya and Mo are 
   never going to be the same again and we, the viewers, are going to be 
   in for one wild ride. First, Shu Ya discovers that Mo is a womanizing 
   bastard (she should have realized it when she discovered a pair of 
   panties on his bed and he tells her that they are his mother's!) and 
   he blows her off by giving her some photos of them together. Next, 
   she discovers her father's rotting corpse (a rat crawls out of his 
   mouth!) in her mother's closet and Mom tells Shu Ya that she murdered 
   him two months ago when he came home drunk and tried to rape her. She 
   also tells Shu Ya that dear old Dad was full of syphilis, which would 
   explain why Doggie is severely deformed and retarded. Mom ends the 
   conversation by telling Shu Ya that she should get a medical check-up 
   (Mom is one piece of work, isn't she?). Meanwhile, Mo puts the moves 
   on Li Ting Ting (Tsang Hing Yu), the pretty daughter of the Master of 
   the temple where he stole the statue. When Shu Ya discovers that she 
   is pregnant, Mo takes her to an illegal abortion clinic (that he has 
   used before), where Shu Ya discovers a refrigerator full of aborted 
   fetuses. When the doctor tries to perform an abortion on Shu Ya, the 
   demon suddenly appears, strangling the nurse and shoving a hypodermic 
   needle in the doctor's eye. A few months later, Shu Ya forces Mo to 
   drive her to the hospital when the baby is due, but when Mo refuses 
   to accept that he is the father (he's right, of course, but he's 
   still a cad) and tells her he is in love with Li Ting Ting, they get 
   into a car accident and Shu Ya is burned alive, her last words 
   cursing Mo's life. The events that happen next are some of the most 
   gruesome and amazing set pieces in Hong Kong horror film history, as 
   a grotesque monster baby is born during Shu Ya's autopsy (it rips-off 
   the medical examiner's head!) and escapes into the night seeking 
   revenge on Mo and those close to him. To say any more would be a 
   great disservice to the viewer (everything I have described happens 
   in the first 40 minutes!), so be ready for a wild ride, because 
   revenge is a dish best served dead.&nbsp; Even the most jaded Hong 
   Kong horror film fanatic will be surprised by this dark, brooding 
   piece of depravity. For once, there is not one iota of humor in this 
   film, as director Ho Meng-Hua (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackMagic1975">BLACK

   atmospheric and unbelievable sights, such as frog-puking (a priest 
   performs some unsanitary brain surgery on some poor possessed man and 
   pulls out a live frog!); grave robbing and desecration; a scene where 
   Li Ting Ting's housekeeper dices the fingers of her hands with a 
   cleaver before burying it in her skull; a giant zombie with a taste 
   for human ears; a horde of zombies rising out of their coffins and 
   making a meal out of some unfortunate monks trying to help Mo; and 
   some disturbing sequences where possessed children plead with Li Ting 
   Ting's father to &quot;Pass me the embryo!&quot; This movie has the 
   distinction of having the most scenes of people puking than any other 
   horror movie in history (discounting the &quot;vomit gore&quot; films 
   Lucifer Valentine, but they hardly register as films, never mind 
   horror films). This is unforgettable stuff, folks, so be prepared for 
   what you are about to witness. Strong stomachs required. Some review 
   and reference sites list cinematographer Tom Lau Moon Tong as the 
   director of this film, but the on-screen credits plainly state that

    film is like trying to explain the color orange to a blind man. Mimi 
   Rodgers (great performance) is Sharon, who by day has a boring job as 
   a telephone operator and by night cruises airport bars and motels 
   with her sexual partner, Vic (Patrick Bauchau), looking for couples 
   to swing with. At her job she overhears a trio of her co-workers 
   talking about &quot;The Dream&quot; and &quot;The Boy&quot;. No one 
   will tell her what it means explaining that she will understand it 
   all if she puts her trust and love in God. &quot;The Dream&quot; is 
   actually a vision of The Rapture, when God comes down to Earth to 
   pass judgment. All those who do not believe in Him will perish, and 
   will not be able to enter Heaven. &quot;The Boy&quot; is a black 
   child prophet who knows the year when the Rapture will happen. Sharon 
   becomes born again and leaves behind her life of sexual debauchery. 
   She marries and has a baby girl. Six years pass and she and her 
   family are still living the life of God. Tragedy strikes when 
   Sharon's husband (David Duchovny) is gunned down, along with a half 
   dozen other people, by an alcoholic ex-employee he recently fired. 
   Sharon has a vision which she interprets as meaning God wants her and 
   her daughter to go to the desert and wait for Him to take them to 
   Heaven. After many weeks and some false alarms, Sharon becomes 
   disillusioned. Partly due to malnutrition and exposure and partly due 
   to her religious fervor, she decides that God wants her to kill her 
   daughter so she can be in Heaven with her daddy. Sharon cannot kill 
   herself because that would be a sin. She is arrested and loses her 
   faith. The remainder of the film is genuinely eerie and 
   goosebump-inducing, so I will not spoil it for you. This sleeper of 
   1991 is sure to become a classic in the years to come. Sprinkled 
   throughout with weird visuals (i.e. religious symbolism tatooed on a 
   naked lady), nudity and shocking bits of violence. It's like tripping 
   on acid without the after effects. Everyone is to be congratulated in 
   front and behind the camera. Highly recommended! Director Michael

   indictment against televised evangalism. Dennis Hopper is Reverend 
   Tom Harley, who performs bogus faith healings coast-to-coast via 
   satellite. The Reverend's associates catch wind of a true faith 
   healer in Italy and send Michael Moriarty to bring her back to the 
   States so she can tour with the Reverend's group. Mary (Antonella 
   Murgia), the faith healer, is a virgin and falls in love with 
   Moriarty. In one of the strangest scenes in film history, Moriarty's 
   dick gets stuck inside Mary's vagina when she passes out while making 
   love for the first time (every man's nightmare!). Mary is soon 
   separated from Moriarty by the Reverend, as she is taught English, 
   shaved under the armpits and generally Americanized. The Reverend has 
   made her a viable commercial property. Mary slips deeper and deeper 
   into depression and Moriarty begins to hear voices emanating from his 
   boom box and television. Moriarty finds out Mary is pregnant and 
   steals her away from the Reverend. Mary delivers her baby (a boy) at 
   a gas station with the help of three old attendants. (Get it?) After 
   seeing one of Mary's true healings, the Reverend becomes a true 
   believer and is born again. And did I mention that God pilots a 
   helicopter? This little-seen film is a must for fans of the bizarre. 
   It boasts a fairly restrained performance by Hopper, Moriarty's usual 
   quirky acting (an asset for most films he appears in), along with 
   nudity and some strange religious imagery. No blood is on hand 
   because the story line is devoid of violence. Director Bigas (I bet

   barely makes a living with his paintings, selling them to an art 
   gallery owner for outrageously low sums (Once you see his paintings, 
   you'll know why. I'm surprised he is not out on the streets selling 
   pencils!). Once inside his studio, John notices a man on a motorcycle 
   staring at him intently through his window. When John goes to 
   confront the man, he takes off. That night, someone wearing black 
   gloves and carrying a flashlight sneaks into John's studio while he 
   is sleeping on a chair. It is obvious this person is looking for 
   something, finding a black and white photo of John with a woman. The 
   person is almost discovered by a waking John, but the person escapes 
   with the photo, John none the wiser. A short time later, a man with a 
   Turkish accent walks into a bar and asks a hooker (Aydin Terzel) if 
   she knows this woman, showing her the photo of John with the woman. 
   The hooker says, &quot;Oh, sure, the redhead! She's the boss'

   too much, and she excuses herself to go to the bathroom.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next morning, John runs outside when he hears the mototcycle, 
   discovering a group of hippies having a love-in on the property next 
   to his studio. One hippie approaches him and offers to turn him on. 
   John says no and the hippie says to him, &quot;Why? Do you like the 
   world as it is?&quot; John just replies, &quot;I don't give a 
   damn!&quot; and the hippie says, &quot;Yeah, your right, it's 
   shit&quot; and then leaves to join his group. John notices one hippie 
   with a chick who listens to his every word and they leave, their 
   love-in over. The hippy walks up to John once again, this time with a 
   female mannequin (it's a strange-looking mannequin, with loose limbs, 
   almost like a huge doll), giving it to John after noticing him 
   looking at the hippie chick, saying, &quot;You want a girl like that, 
   too, huh? Well, here's one to make your very own. She's better than 
   the real thing. She'll never talk back and she'll always be waiting. 
   Just take care of her and you can have her...with my blessings.&quot; 
   From that moment on, John's life will never be the same. John takes 
   the mannequin to his studio and tells her that he doesn't like the 
   look of her face (it is blank), so he &quot;fixes her up&quot; with 
   his paints, making her look like his ideal woman and tells her his 
   innermost feelings. It's obvious John is a sandwich short of a 
   picnic, but he seems really happy now.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    BLOOD-STAINED ORCHIDS</A></B> - 1972) offer of sex. He leaves the 
   bar and Mala follows him (with his blessing), telling John she has no 
   place to stay. Mala finds a room in a seedy hotel and invites John to 
   come inside, which he does. She wants to make love to John (But first 
   she says, &quot;Don't look at me. I'm ashamed of myself!&quot;) and 
   discovers he is an artist, offering to be the model for one of his 
   paintings, but John has someone better in mind: his mannequin. He 
   goes to his studio and says to the mannequin, &quot;I'll make you 
   lovely, a dream. You'll be lovely, pure and...faithful. Everything a 
   woman should be!&quot; John begins to treat the mannequin like a real 
   woman and when he scrapes a piece of debri off her back with a knife, 
   the mannequin bleeds, revealing herself to John as a real woman

   the credits as &quot;The Subservient Doll&quot;). He covers her naked 
   body with his red sweater and begins painting again, only this time 
   his paintings fetch much more money than they did before. His new 
   muse is unable to speak, but she does everything John wants in a 
   woman, making him very happy. That happiness won't last very long, 
   however, as John gives her some womens clothing he has in his studio 
   and when she puts them on, John has some very bad memories, ordering 
   his muse to take the clothes off, making us wonder about the clothes' 
   original owner.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    John gets drunk and passes out, waking up with a different, 
   red-headed woman beneath him (Erika Blanc; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DevilsNightmare1971">THE

    Sensuous Doll</A>&quot; [an alternate title to this film]). Then his 
   paintings again don't sell too well, the art gallery owner telling 
   John that the gallery needs something more &quot;commercial&quot;, 
   such as beautiful women in pornographic poses. John doesn't want to 
   paint pornography, but when he goes back to his studio, the Sensuous 
   Doll eggs-on John to paint a pornographic picture of herself, which 
   sells very well (maybe too well) and John becomes a best-selling 
   painter of porn. John is not a happy man because the Sensuous Doll 
   verbally abuses him every chance she gets and is having an affair 
   with his neighbor, Omar Bay (Venantino Venantini; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CityLivingDead1980">CITY
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> - 1980). A wealthy Turkish buyer of 
   John's porno paintings (Erol Keskin) offers him an outrageous amount 
   of money for another nude painting, which John needs because the 
   Sensuous Doll spends his money as fast as he can make it, on 
   expensive clothing, jewelry and other high-priced trinkets, something 
   John hates in a woman.&nbsp; At this point in the film, we have to 
   ask ourselves if the Sensuous Doll is real or just something in 
   John's twisted mind? Is she having an affair with his neighbor (and 
   later, his wealthy buyer) or is all this happening for another reason?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Sensuous Doll is the complete opposite of what John expects from 
   a woman, but why did she pick this time to come into John's life? 
   Maybe if we find out who originally wore those womens clothing in his 
   studio, we could get a better clue on why John is so suspicious of 
   this new red-headed woman in his life. The Sensuous Doll hardly ever 
   leaves her studio (when she does, she tempts a teenage boy by asking 
   him to put sunscreen lotion on her back, describing to him in detail 
   how he should do it, which would turn-on a deaf man!) and every time 
   John comes home, she asks him what he bought her. If he comes home 
   empty-handed, she throws a hissy fit and won't talk to him, which 
   even makes him more suspicious, especially when he finds Omar's cigar 
   butts in his ashtray.&nbsp; She knows how to push John's buttons, 
   which makes us wonder if the Sensuous Doll is nothing but a a strange 
   amalgam of memories in John's mind of the mystery woman he never 
   talks about. But what happened to her? Is it possible that the 
   Sensuous Doll is possessed by the spirit of that woman or is there a 
   more down-to-earth explanation? Either way, John will soon pay for 
   his past.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   a psycho about to lose control and discovering the clues that tell us

    in her body. Her debasement of John is this film's glue, as we can't 
   wait for the time John loses control, showing us exactly what he did 
   to the red-haired woman in the photo. We see John hugging the 
   Sensuous Doll while stabbing her over-and-over, killing her and then 
   burying her in his backyard. Is it possible that the red-haired woman 
   is buried there, too, or is what we are watching nothing more than an 
   &quot;instant replay&quot; in John's mind? Bet on the latter, as 
   everything John did is explained in detail in the film's finale (much 
   in the same way as the finale of Hitchcock's <B><A HREF="psycho_1960.htm">PSYCHO</A></B>

   buyer is a police detective investigating her disappearance and the 
   art gallery owner is the detective's assistant). Everything is 
   resolved in a nice and tidy manner. This film also has some nice

   as they have Lennox captive, Memphis sees this as his ticket to easy 
   street. They steal a Rolls Royce from two old ladies on the side of 
   the road and Memphis picks up two street hookers for some personal 
   enjoyment. When he goes to pay them with some of the stolen jewels, 
   Memphis discovers that all he and Mosquito stole from the jewelry 
   store was nothing but worthless cutlery. Everything changes after 
   that. The trio turns on each other and Lennox uses that knowledge to 
   his advantage. Maria wants to leave on her own, but Memphis rapes, 
   then kills her. He then puts her body in the Rolls and pushes it over 
   a cliff. Lennox, meanwhile, has aligned himself with Mosquito, as 
   they search for a now-missing Memphis and the now-dead Maria 
   (Mosquito lets Lennox take sips from his <A HREF="j&amp;b_scotch_whiskey_in_italian_films.htm">J&amp;B
    Scotch bottle</A> to keep warm and he gets drunk!). They come upon a 
   mansion of an aging Princess (Maria Michi), who feeds and gives them 
   shelter. Mosquito and Lennox slowly become friends (Mosquito&nbsp; 
   even shaves in the nude in front of him!), but one gets the feeling 
   that Lennox is wise beyond his years. A psychotic Memphis shows up at 
   the mansion and soon it's a battle of wills. Lennox begins playing 
   Memphis and Mosquito against each other as they try to stay one step 
   ahead of the police while trying to make it across the border. Of 
   course, things turn out badly for everyone involved, but only one 
   will make it out alive as a totally changed individual.&nbsp; This 
   British/Italian co-production is a real hard film to categorize. One 
   moment it's a heist thriller, then it's a chase drama and then it's a 
   slapstick comedy, but all the while it has a real nasty edge to it, 
   thanks to the over-the-top<A HREF="redneck_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/redneck spanish poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="153" HEIGHT="232" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   performance by Telly Savalas as Memphis. Maybe 
   &quot;over-the-top&quot; is being too mild, as Savalas plays his 
   character as a no-remorse, soulless psychopath, who sings &quot;Jesus 
   Loves The Little Children&quot; while blowing away kids, women and 
   even a dog (!) and then screaming incoherently, &quot;I didn't want 
   to do it! They made me do it!&quot; While Savalas' laughable Southern 
   accent comes and goes, his savagery never wavers, especially the 
   scene where he locks a family in a mobile home and dumps them in a 
   lake, blaming his act on Lennox for trying to tell them who he is 
   (Memphis' balls get caught on the trailer hitch when he pushes the 
   trailer and he spends the rest of the film with a huge blood stain on 
   the crotch of his pants!). Surprisingly, the only nudity on display 
   here is from Franco Nero (<B><A HREF="fifth_cord_1971.htm">THE FIFTH CORD</A></B>

   personalities. While no one trusts anyone else, they stick together 
   because they have no one else in their lives to care about them. Even 
   Lennox's wealthy mother (Beatrice Clary) doesn't know her own son's 
   age when she reports him missing to the police, so it's no wonder why 
   Lennox is such a fucked-up, conniving kid. I especially liked the 
   nihilistic ending that shows people like Memphis aren't born that 
   way, they're created as a by-product of their environment. Memphis is 
   really the only person in this film who truly understands Lennox and 
   his motivations (and, therefore, doesn't trust him), so it comes as 
   no surprise who Lennox morphs into in the final shot. <B><A HREF="redneck_1973b.htm">R</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="redneck_1973b.htm">EDNECK</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">

   film was made in 2009 (under the shooting title &quot;<B>The Birthday Party</B>&quot;),

   it's a wonderful film to add to your library, no matter which format 
   it is released on. The film begins with Aaron (Henry Thomas; <B><A HREF="et_the_extra_terrestrial_1982.htm">E.T.
    THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL</A></B> - 1982; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Dead Birds">DEAD

   throwing objects tantrums of his next-door neighbors, Linda (Kelli 
   Garner; <B><A HREF="horns_2013.htm">HORNS</A></B> - 2013) and Kyle 
   (Jordan Hagan). The walls are thin, so Aaron can hear everything and 
   it's impossible for him to get things done. Aaron meets Linda at the 
   local laundromat, where <A HREF="red_velvet_2009.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/red velvet 2008 dvd8 front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="209" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>their
    conversation about what he hears through his walls gets contentious 
   at times (Aaron tells her, &quot;PlayStations don't cry, 
   Linda!&quot;). They both seem to get a thrill putting each other down 
   (Aaron is sporting a black eye, but he refuses to tell Linda how he 
   got it.). They decide to have lunch together at the local Thai 
   restaurant, where they continue their adversarial conversation, until 
   Aaron tells her that he is a storyteller. As we watch the Thai cook 
   squish a cockroach on the cooking grill as she flicks it away with 
   her cooking utensils (which is why I don't eat Thai food!), Aaron 
   tells Linda a story. It is about a family of four, the father (S.A. 
   Griffin; <B><A HREF="near_dark_1987.htm">NEAR DARK</A></B> - 1987), 
   daughter (Carli Westerman; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#King Ants">KING
    OF THE ANTS</A></B> - 2003) and son (Austin Whitlock) sitting around 
   a dinner table, while they hear their crazy wife/mother (Carol Ann 
   Susi; best known for her portrayal of the voice of recurring unseen 
   character Mrs. Wolowitz on the television series <B><A HREF="big_bang_theory_tv_series_2007.htm">THE
    BIG BANG THEORY</A></B>; she passed away on November 11, 2014), who 
   Dad says is off her meds, complaining about how her family doesn't 
   appreciate her. She comes out of the kitchen with a spaghetti dinner 
   and serves it to them with her hands, still complaining that her 
   family takes advantage of her (she's quite scary, actually). She 
   threatens her son with bodily harm, but Dad warns her not to touch 
   him. She stares at her son and says, &quot;They won't be around 
   forever. Just you wait. Just you wait!&quot; That night, Dad, aided 
   by his son and daughter, suffocate her with a pillow while she is 
   sleeping in bed and then just stand there, looking at the twisted 
   face on her corpse. Linda is not impressed with Aaron's story because 
   it is not &quot;horrific&quot; enough, so he tells her another story 
   about a ninja that cuts off the female Thai's cook's head and cooks 
   it, the severed head saying while it is cooking in the wok, &quot;It 
   needs a little more fish salt!&quot; (There's an ingenious little 
   moment where, when the cook's head is cut off, the blood splatters on 
   a photo of a Thai pop star. We see the photo come to life as he looks 
   at all the blood on his clothes! This film is full of those little 
   moments.). When the ninja takes off the face covering, it turns out 
   to be Linda, but even that story doesn't cheer her up because she 
   wants to go to a party in a secluded cabin in the woods with her 
   friends to celebrate a birthday, but Kyle won't let her borrow the 
   car to drive there. Aaron says he will make a &quot;custom&quot; 
   story for Linda about the party she is going to miss, but he needs 
   some background information first, including where the secluded cabin 
   is located, the names of her friends who will be there (including 
   birthday boy Frank [Bret Roberts; <B><A HREF="violent_kind_2010.htm">THE
    VIOLENT KIND</A></B> - 2010] and Linda's sister Pat [Cristen Coppen; <B><A HREF="staunton_hill_2009.htm">STAUNTON
    HILL</A></B> - 2009]). With that information, Aaron begins to tell 
   her his story, but the story keeps on changing due to Linda's 
   constant interruptions of descriptions of her friends' looks and what 
   type of cars they drive. Aaron continues telling his story, where 
   Frank enters the cabin with Pat and everyone begins to party, but he 
   is interrupted again, this time by the female Thai waitress, who says 
   that she has seen Linda before. Aaron gets back to his story, but now 
   Frank and the gang are heading to the local lake to do some swimming 
   and rafting. Frank stops the story and says a story like this needs a 
   maniac to crash the party, so he asks Linda to help him create the 
   perfect maniac for the story. They come up with some weird ideas, 
   like a maniac totally in blackface and another maniac with a toaster 
   on his head (we see these maniacs on-screen and they are quite 
   funny). They almost come up with a perfect maniac with a guy with a 
   stocking over his head wrapped with barb wire, but they finally 
   settle on a maniac wearing a black a ski mask with bunny ears, a 
   Polaroid camera attached to the top of his head (so he can take 
   photos of his dead victims), dressed in a one-piece white uniform 
   (the kind that has a long zipper in the front) with a pink tool belt 
   (that last one was Linda's idea). While Frank and his friends are 
   having fun at the lake, Jon (Kevin Wheatley; <B><A HREF="rise_blood_hunter_2006.htm">RISE:
    BLOOD HUNTER</A></B> - 2006) returns to the cabin to pick up a CD 
   player so they can listen to some tunes. The maniac wraps a thick 
   wire around Jon's neck and strangles him until the CD player is 
   pressed up against his ear. Linda is not too pleased that her friends 
   are getting killed in the story, but Aaron convinces her that it will 
   improve his story and Linda says, &quot;Death is too good for 
   them!&quot;, so Aaron continues his story. But before he can tell any 
   more, the waitress brings the check and Linda heads back to the 
   laundromat to fold her laundry (Aaron yells out, &quot;Kyle's a 
   hobby. I'm for real!&quot;). Aaron meets Linda back at the laundromat 
   (where she teaches him how to properly fold clothes) and he tells 
   Linda that if she really wants to be at the party, she would find a 
   way to get there. Aaron tells Linda that he has a vision of Kyle, 
   where he almost chokes to death on popcorn while watching sports on 
   TV, almost gets stabbed by a butcher knife when he falls to the floor 
   and the knife drops off the counter and then electrocutes himself by 
   sticking a fork in a toaster. Linda laughs at Kyle's death in the 
   story, but says he hasn't suffered enough, so Aaron embellishes on 
   the story where Kyle falls down and a 5 gallon water bottle full of 
   loose change gets lodged in his mouth, him swallowing all the coins 
   (Believe me when I say that everything I have so far described will 
   make sense. Just be patient.). Linda makes Aaron finish the story 
   about the maniac loose at the party, where we see nerd Roy (Eric 
   Jungmann; Director Robert Englund's <B><A HREF="killer_pad_2008.htm">KILLER
    PAD</A></B> - 2008) spying on a totally nude Frank and equally nude 
   Jenny (Michele Nordin; <B><A HREF="ancient_evil_scream_of_the_mummy_1999.htm">ANCIENT
    EVIL: SCREAM OF THE MUMMY</A></B> - 1999) having sex in the woods. 
   The maniac stabs Roy over and over on his back, while Frank heads 
   back to the lake. Jenny, who knew Roy was watching them, stays behind 
   to give Roy a treat, but when she discovers his bloody body wedged 
   between a fork in a tree, the maniac beheads her with an axe and her 
   head goes flying through the air. Linda thinks it's a clich&eacute; 
   that people in horror films and stories always get killed for having 
   sex (it is) and she tells Aaron that Frank is actually gay, so he has 
   to make a change to his story. This time, Roy and Jenny are stuck in 
   a hole in the ground when someone throws them a rope. The only 
   problem is that the other end the rope is tied around the neck of an 
   alligator and, as they try to climb the rope, the alligator inches 
   closer and closer to the hole, finally falling in and killing Roy and 
   Jenny. The rest of the friends are back at the cabin when Franks 
   decides to go looking for Jon (not knowing that he is already dead) 
   and runs into Ken (Ryan Doom; <B><A HREF="circle_2010.htm">CIRCLE</A></B> 
   - 2010), who is also gay. Frank ties himself up to a hook in the shed 
   so he and Ken can participate in some S&amp;M action. They engage in 
   some kissing and foreplay (i.e. oral sex) when the maniac shows up 
   and plays &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; on a huge tree saw (the kind it 
   takes two people to use). The maniac then plants the saw in the top 
   of Ken's head and cuts him vertically in half (the film's most 
   graphic death). The blood sprays all over a tied-up Frank's body, but 
   the maniac just takes a Polaroid of Ken's cleaved-in-two corpse and 
   leaves Frank hanging. The last two people in the cabin, Pat and Amy 
   (Natalia Baron) are dancing when Linda cuts off the story, carrying 
   her folded laundry to to her apartment building, where she and Aaron 
   share an elevator to their apartments. Kyle has left their apartment 
   a mess and is not there, so Linda goes to Aaron's apartment to 
   complain that even though Kyle won't let her go to the party, he has 
   bailed on her for the night. Aaron says the best revenge is that he 
   drives her to the party to piss-off Kyle. Linda races back to her 
   apartment to get all dolled-up (something tells me it's more for 
   Aaron than for her friends) and Aaron then begins to drive to the 
   cabin, where the two discuss the real meaning of &quot;rub it in&quot;
    and that when a vegetarian takes a shit, it's smellier than one who 
   eats meat (that, too, is true). On the drive, Aaron finishes the 
   party story, where Amy is freaking out about their missing friends 
   (she says that maybe they all fell down a well and alligators ate 
   them!). Pat and Amy leave the cabin to go look for their friends and 
   end up on a fog-filled dock, where they hear someone whistling a 
   catcall. Thinking it is their friends playing a prank on them, they 
   soon realize their mistake, as they run into the maniac and their 
   friends' dead bodies. They try to escape in a tinkered-with car, 
   while the maniac takes a Polaroid of them (every time the maniac 
   takes a photo, the background twirls around like a panel in a comic 
   book). They leave the car, but the maniac bashes in Amy's head to a 
   bloody pulp with two hammers, one in each hand (it's another really<A HREF="red_velvet_2009.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/red velvet postcard4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="201" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   gory scene). Linda once again interrupts and warns Aaron that he 
   better not kill off his sister in the story, so we see Pat slug the 
   maniac and tackle him into the lake and pulls off his ski mask. The 
   maniac is Aaron and he drowns because of the weight of the pink 
   toolbelt. When Aaron and Linda actually make it to the cabin, they 
   notice that it is very quiet and then hear a woman scream in the 
   cabin. Aaron goes to investigate, but when he doesn't come back, 
   Linda goes into the cabin and discovers that the maniac holding a 
   knife to Aaron's throat, so she kills the maniac with a claw hammer, 
   only to find out it is her sister Pat. It seems Aaron was already at 
   the cabin (remember, the walls that separates his and Linda's 
   apartment are thin) and killed everyone there except Pat, who he left 
   tied-up as a patsy (Remember Aaron's black eye? Pat gave it to him 
   when she punched him into the lake.), but Kyle is now there as a 
   surprise for Linda and beats up Aaron to a bloody pulp. But when Kyle 
   and Linda go to leave the cabin, they open the door to find the 
   ground covered in loose change and coins come pouring out of Kyle's 
   mouth (think back), killing him. The film ends with Aaron burying all 
   the bodies (including Linda alive) and returning to his apartment, 
   where he thinks he will finally have peace and quiet at last. But one 
   final surprise is in store as we discover that Aaron was the son that 
   helped his family suffocate his mother and her ghost appears in his 
   apartment to torment him forever.&nbsp; This filmed-in-Los Angeles 
   horror film has the same kind of structure as the cult hit <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#TrickRTreat">TRICK
    'R TREAT</A></B> (2007), where we think every story is not related, 
   but, in the end, we discover that they are all interconnected. This 
   is the first fictional feature film by director Bruce Dickson, who 
   also photographed and co-produced the horror film <B><A HREF="stitch_2014.htm">STITCH</A></B> 
   in 2014 and, for a first feature, it is damn good. The idea of making 
   up stories on the fly is as old as storytelling itself, but this film 
   infuses new blood into the concept, as they are not made-up stories 
   at all, but actually the truth and Dickson fills the story with great 
   dialogue between Aaron and Linda (supplied by screenwriters Anthony 
   Burns and Joe Moe [who is also a producer]), some very graphic 
   bloodshed and copious nudity. Henry Thomas is superb here, as we get 
   the feeling that there is something seriously wrong with him, but we 
   just can't put our finger on it. I generally don't like anthologies, 
   but this really isn't one, as the stories change on a whim and end 
   with quite a surprise (the only thing I'm not sure of is how the 
   beheading of the Thai cook connects with anything, but I'm going to 
   watch it again because there is a lot going on in this film that I 
   may have missed). This is also final cameo appearance of Forrest J. 
   Ackerman, but you'll have to be quick in spotting him early in the 
   film (He gets a &quot;Thanks&quot; in the final credits, too). 
   Recommended to people who like their films on the weird and slightly 
   perverted side. Also starring Dina Lynne Morishita as the Thai 
   waitress/cook and Steven Skyler as the Thai Pop Idol who gets blood 
   spilled on his photograph. Also featuring Earl Roesel, Lateef Crowder 
   and Lewis Tan as the various incarnations of the maniacs we are shown 
   on screen. The DVD-R also contains a lot of extras and is well worth 
   owning for $14.99. Most people think this is a 2008 production, but 
   it has a 2009 copyright date at the end credits. A 3 Mac Studios

   best possession films of the 80's. This had to be edited to receive 
   an R-Rating, but the edits (which amount to less than 10 seconds of 
   footage and are found on Code Red's DVD &amp; Blu-Ray as an extra) 
   could have easily been re-inserted because they are quite graphic and 
   increase the 'ewww!' factor. This is a great possession film with an 
   unusual premise. Failed artist and nebbish-looking George Miller 
   (Dennis Lipscomb) decides to end his life by jumping off the roof of 
   his apartment building (on Halloween, no less), while all the people 
   in the apartment complex (who really seem to care about him. even if 
   they are dressed in groteaque costumes) look on at the street below. 
   At the exact same time George jumps, small-time mobster Vito Minelli 
   Sr. (Mike Muscat) is shot and set on fire, saying &quot;Santa Maria, 
   Mother of God, help me!&quot; (We do not see who his murderers are). 
   Miraculously, George survives the fall with nothing but a leg injury 
   but, somehow, his soul intertwines with Vito's and George becomes 
   possessed at various times in the film by Vito to get even with those 
   who killed him. George's psychiatrist, Jennifer&nbsp; Curtis (Leslie 
   Wing), is pleased with his progress and lets him leave the 
   psychiatric institute after giving him a<A HREF="retribution_1987_dvd.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/retribution dvd small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="320" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   special gift of a cane she spent her own money on. The occupants of 
   George's apartment complex are happy to see George return and throw 
   him a welcome home party (they are the nicest neighbors anyone could 
   hope to have). One of George's best friends is hooker Angel (Suzanne 
   Snyder; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Return Dead 2">RETURN OF 
   THE LIVING DEAD II</A></B> - 1988). At the party, George ends up 
   having sex with Angel, where she says that she wishes she could be 
   his girlfriend, but her profession makes that impossible (George has 
   never judged her by her occupation, proving what a nice guy he really 
   is.). George's first encounter with Vito's soul is when he paints 
   with a brush dipped in yellow paint and it comes out blood red on the 
   canvas (He also begins having nightmares showing the faces of all of 
   Vito's murderers). He finds himself at a bar having a mixed drink he 
   has never tried before, and the bar's owner, Sally Benson (Pamela 
   Dunlop), Vito's mistress and also one of his killers, notices George 
   drinking Vito's mixed drink, she invites him to come upstairs for a 
   little something more than a drink. Suddenly, Sally's kitchen, turns 
   into a supernatural nightmare, with windows exploding, cabinets 
   opening and everything comes flying out and smashing&nbsp; against 
   walls. George comes walking into the kitchen with green glowing eyes 
   and says &quot;Santa Maria, Mother of God, help me!&quot; and Sally 
   knows instantly who he is. He makes Sally take a butcher knife and 
   stab herself in the stomach, running it across her stomach in a 
   horizontal position (one of the scenes that was partially cut to 
   achieve an R-Rating). George tries to explain his nightmares to 
   Jennifer, but when he reads in the papers about Sally's death, he 
   knows that it was no nightmare. Jennifer tries to calm George down by 
   telling him it was nothing but a bad nightmare, but suddenly she gets 
   a bad nose bleed and has to excuse herself. He hops on a bus 
   (something he has never done in his life) and notices a building that 
   seems familiar to him. When the bus driver refuses to stop. George 
   causes the bus to crash and meets Vito's son, Vito, Jr. (Matthew 
   Newmark) and his widow, Carla (Clare Peck), but Carla becomes 
   freaked-out and chases George away (Vito, Jr., on the other hand, 
   seems to like him). While George is sleepimg with Angel, he finds 
   himself in a slaughterhouse. where he stuffs Johnny's (Mario 
   Roccuzzi) body (he was also one of Vito's killers) inside the carcass 
   of a cow and then has him cut in half with a meat saw (But first 
   saying to him 'Santa Maria, Mother of God, help me!&quot; to let him 
   know who he is dealing with; this was another scene trimmed briefly 
   to get an R-Rating). George goes to Jennifer and confesses to the 
   murders, where nosy Dr. Alan Falconer (Jeff Pomerantz) hears the 
   whole confession. Jennifer wants to re-commit him to the institution 
   on a voluntary basis, but George says that the murders will continue 
   to happen no matter where he sleeps (Vito's soul leaves George's body 
   while he is sleeping and can walk through any substance. His soul 
   also looks like George.). George takes a cab (Guy Magar plays the cab 
   driver) which takes him to Vito's resting place in a graveyard. Carla 
   and Vito, Jr. are also there and George tries to explain what is 
   happening to him and would like to know any reason why Vito was drawn 
   to him. George discovers that they were born on the same day and year 
   and he was killed the exact time George tried to commit suicide. 
   Jennifer begins to believe George's story and brings her findings to 
   a doctors meeting, where Dr. John Talbot (George Murdock; <B><A HREF="mack_1973.htm">THE
    MACK</A></B> - 1973) is the head doctor. Dr. Falconer brings in 
   Police Lt. Ashley (Hoyt Axton; <B><A HREF="gremlins_1984.htm">GREMLINS</A></B> 
   - 1984) to investigate based on what he overheard George tell 
   Jennifer, but Jennifer refuses to give Lt. Ashley George's name since 
   Dr. Falconer didn't know it (Jennifer does dump a drink over 
   Falconer's head, though). Angel and George smoke a joint and have a 
   great time together, especially at a neon light art gallery, where 
   George shows her his favorite piece: a giant stone head he calls 
   &quot;The Eternal Head&quot;. George starts seeing gallons of blood 
   pouring out of the large statue and he ends up at a church, which 
   seems to calm him down. Angel sets up George to see Doctor Rasta 
   (Danny D. Daniels), a Rastafarian doctor that has helped Angel with 
   her problems, and she brings along George's friend Dylan (Executive 
   Producer Chris Caputo) with them. George and Doctor Rasta hold hands 
   and Doctor Rasta begins to bleed through his nose. Doctor Rasta 
   pleads, &quot;Let go of me, motherfucker!&quot;, but George is unable 
   to and Doctor Rasta dies. George is having himself committed in the 
   morning and begs Angel and Dylan to tie him up that night (not 
   knowing that it will do no good). George then finds himself at a 
   mechanics garage and kills Joe Martinez (Jeffrey Josephson) in the 
   film's bloody highlight (also one of the most cut sequences to 
   receive an R-rating). He makes Joe cut off his left hand with and 
   acetylene torch (really hard to watch, even in the R-Rated cut) and 
   then George squishes his face into a bloody pulp by using a portable 
   lift machine with a grate. When Joe's face meets the grate, you will 
   notice a definite cut, but you can see the whole disgusting scene in 
   the cut violent scenes. It only lasts a few seconds, but leaves an 
   impression (Makeup guru Kevin Yagher did most of the excellent 
   effects). George wakes up and still finds himself tied-up at Angel's 
   apartment, so he frees himself and goes to his own apartment, which 
   is being staked out by Lt. Ashley and Lt. Lupo (David Dunard). George 
   stabs a painting, which begins bleeding profusely and Jennifer sees 
   the murder at the garage on the TV news and calls George, who now 
   sounds like Vito. George wants to end his life, but his typewrites 
   self-types, &quot;Not yet you fucking asshole. One more!&quot;, as 
   all Hell breaks loose in the room (the same as Sally's kitchen). 
   George's body travels to Vito's murder site and we see all the people 
   take one shot at Vito, using the same gun, not killing him, but 
   leaving him in a lot of pain. His body is then soaked in gasoline and 
   set on fire, which actually killed him. There is only one person 
   still alive from the murder scene: Amos (Ralph Manza). The spirit of 
   Vito leaves George's body and begins killing Jennifer by lifting her 
   off the ground and psychically choking her. George yells out &quot;No 
   more!&quot;, grabs Vito's spirit and jumps out the window, finally 
   committing the suicide he started weeks before. All the occupants 
   come out of the building to pay their final respects, but Angel has a 
   surprise in store for all of them. In the immortal words of Vito: 
   &quot;Santa Maria, Mother of God, help me! One more!&quot;&nbsp; This

    <B><A HREF="fist_of_legend_1994.htm">FIST OF LEGEND</A></B> - 1994), 
   a famous explorer and archaeologist (Dr. Yuan Cheng-ha is actually at

    to get the story of a lifetime (other reporters on the scene 
   mockingly call her &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;). Once in the hospital, 
   Dr. Yuan begins administering to the heart attack victim, but Tsai 
   Hung draws unwanted attention to herself when she shows she doesn't 
   even know the basics of first aid. Dr. Yuan bravely saves the day by 
   setting off the flash grenade (just after one SWAT team member is 
   graphically shot in the head) and kicking the shit out of the head 
   terrorist, while the cops kill all the other terrorists. Amazingly, 
   Dr. Yuan lets Tsai Hung off the hook and congratulates the 
   now-conscious Inspector Chiang on a job well done in front of her 
   boss, Captain Ho (all Inspector Chiang can do is scratch her head in 
   befuddlement). Dr, Yuan is constantly hounded by Tsai Hung, who wants 
   to do a story on his life, but Dr. Yuan doesn't care for her 
   (besides, he has a beautiful white girlfriend, played by Joyce 
   Godenzi, who is now Samo Hung's wife). At his palatial home, Dr. Yuan 
   is attacked by Heh Lung (Dick Wei; <B><A HREF="witch_from_nepal_1985.htm">WITCH
    FROM NEPAL</A></B> - 1985) and a glass-shattering fight ensues. When 
   the fight is over, Heh Lung informs Dr. Yuan that a blood spell was 
   performed on him nearly a year ago and he needs to travel to Thailand 
   to have it removed before he dies. Dr. Yuan doesn't believe it, but 
   he changes his tune rather quickly when all the veins in his leg 
   start swelling while he is making love to his girlfriend and one of 
   them bursts, spraying blood all over her. A flashback reveals how a 
   blood spell was put on Dr. Yuan when he visited Northern Thailand a 
   year earlier. He and a group of explorers, including the Professor 
   (Ken Boyle;<A HREF="operation_condor_2_armour_of_the_gods_1987.htm"> </A><B><A HREF="operation_condor_2_armour_of_the_gods_1987.htm">OPERATION
    CONDOR 2: THE ARMOUR OF THE GODS</A></B> - 1987), witnessed a 
   sacrificial ceremony performed by the Worm Tribe and Dr. Yuan saves a 
   beautiful young girl, Betsy (Tsui Sau-Lai), the fianc&eacute;e of Heh 
   Lung, from being sacrificed by evil sorcerer Aquala (Elvis Tsui, who 
   keeps a bloodthirsty baby-like creature called a &quot;Little 
   Ghost&quot; on his back and sends it out to eat his enemies from the 
   inside-out!). After saving Betsy from the &quot;Old Ancestor&quot; (a 
   skeletal creature that likes to chew on human flesh and then 
   transforms into a winged <B><A HREF="alien_1979c.htm">ALIEN</A></B> 
   [1979]-like monster), Dr. Yuan and the Professor are captured (the 
   rest of their party is butchered by the Worm Tribe) and Aquala pours 
   goop over the Professor's head, forcing his body to erupt in a shower 
   of maggots (Dr. Yuan pukes at the sight). Aquala then performs the 
   blood spell on Dr. Yuan, but before he can complete it, Dr. Yuan uses 
   a magnifying glass to burn off the ropes that bind him and escapes, 
   while veins and arteries in his body explode. A naked Betsy slices 
   off a piece of her breast (!) and makes Dr. Yuan eat it, which 
   temporarily cures him of his affliction, but for only a year (Which 
   beggars the question: Why did Dr. Yuan dismiss Heh Lung's warning a 
   year later?). Now, with the help of best friend Mr. Wei (Chow Yun 
   Fat) and Tsai Hung (who turns out to be Mr. Wei's cousin!), Dr. Yuan 
   returns to Thailand to remove the blood spell before his heart 
   bursts. This is going to be one wild, violent and bloody ride!&nbsp; 
   If you ever wondered what an Indiana Jones film would look like with 
   ultra-bloody violence and plenty of gore (it makes the heart-ripping 
   scene in <B><A HREF="indiana_jones_and_the_temple_of_doom_1983.htm">INDIANA

   including martial arts fights, gun battles, encounters with weird 
   creatures and Dr. Yuan popping blood vessels at the most inopportune 
   times, I can't imagine that any fan of Weird Asia can afford to pass 
   this up. There are also some truly amazing stunt sequences on view 
   (it is hard to conceive that some stuntmen weren't seriously injured 
   here, especially when Dr. Yuan drives his Range Rover into the middle 
   of the Worm Tribe's village, knocking over tribe members like bowling 
   pins), children being sacrificed, booby traps, weird tribal rituals 
   and monster battles (Believe me, you haven't truly seen it all until

   Ancestor. It puts <B><A HREF="aliens_vs_predator_requiem_2007.htm">ALIENS

   has a secondary role here and doesn't do much more than act 
   scholarly. Chin Siu-Hou and Dick Wei are the action stars here and

   while Richard (Richard Harrison) is screwing a female hitchhiker in a 
   porno screening room. The hitchhiker pulls out a knife and tries to 
   stab Richard, but he stops her and she dies while spewing yellow goo 
   out of her mouth. A cackling madman breaks into policeman Jackie's 
   (Bernard Tsui) apartment, handcuffs him, rapes his girlfriend and 
   injects her with a drug. Jackie manages to free himself from the 
   handcuffs and beats the crap out of the laughing madman while three 
   young women watch the fracas from their apartment window. The snake 
   creature then kills the three women in their apartment while a blind 
   man plays the flute outside. Another madman has a woman in his 
   apartment tied spread-eagle while he plays a game of nine ball with 
   her vagina (he shoots pool balls with his cue right at her snatch!). 
   Richard is nearly killed by a plumber he calls to fix his leaky 
   pipes, but kills him with the exercise bar he was using to work out. 
   Jackie and his girlfriend are then attacked in their moving car when 
   it suddenly fills with snakes. They crash but manage to escape. Does 
   this review seem severely fragmented? Believe me when I tell you that 
   this is nothing compared to watching this film. It seems the vampire 
   witch has something to do with newspaper reporter Helen (Juliet Chan) 
   turning into a snake monster at the worst times imaginable. She 
   attacks and kills a waiter and a couple taking a bath while 
   transformed into the snake creature and her cheating boyfriend Jackie 
   begins to worry about her. Meanwhile, Richard is being attacked by 
   people under the power of the Queen of Scorpions, the vampire witch, 
   who wants the ring Richard is wearing, as it is the only object that 
   can destroy her. Richard goes to a prophet, who gives him a golden 
   sword and a mystical mirror to defeat the Queen. Helen confesses to 
   Jackie by saying, &quot;I am not a human being. I am a snake 
   demon!&quot; and then tells him a story (told in flashbacks) that is 
   right out of a twisted Mother Goose tale. To make a long story short, 
   everytime the Queen of Scorpions bangs on her tom-toms and the blind 
   guy (who is a security guard!) plays his flute, Helen turns into the 
   snake creature. In a scene that must be seen to be believed, Helen 
   transforms into the snake creature in front of a bunch of policemen, 
   grabs Jackie's <A HREF="scorpion_thunderbolt_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/scorpion thunderbolt german vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="105" HEIGHT="174" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>real
    girlfriend and flies through the air. Jackie saves his girlfriend by 
   slicing his chest open with a knife and letting the snake creature 
   suck on the wound! In the finale, Helen is shot and killed while 
   Richard must fight numerous possessed people before he can square off 
   with the Queen of Scorpions using his ring, mystical mirror and 
   golden sword.&nbsp; Yes, this is another one of director Godfrey Ho's 
   cut-and-paste jobs for producers Joseph Lai and Betty Chan (see 
   reviews of <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#CobraAgainstNinja">COBRA 
   AGAINST NINJA</A></B> -1987 and <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#NinjaTheProtector">NINJA
    THE PROTECTOR</A></B> - 1986) for their IFD Films and Arts Ltd. 
   production company, but this one is different. Instead of the usual 
   martial arts chicanery, <B><A HREF="scorpion_thunderbolt_1985c.htm">SCORPION
    THUNDERBOLT</A></B> is an honest-to-goodness horror film and, 
   although the newly shot footage of Richard Harrison has him fighting 
   numerous opponents, not once does he or anyone else don a ninja 
   costume (the old footage is taken from a Korean film titled <B><A HREF="grudge_of_the_sleepwalking_woman_1983.htm">GRUDGE
    OF THE SLEEPWALKING WOMAN</A></B> [1983]). Since there's not a lot 
   of interaction between the old and new footage, it doesn't seem 
   overtly obvious like some of Ho's martial arts &quot;epics&quot;. 
   Nevermind that the film doesn't make any sense, there's a lot of 
   things to like about this, from the crazy snake monster (it's 
   jaw-dropping), the bloody murders (including in the flashback, where 
   a guy [actually the flute player] gets his eyes yanked out of their 
   sockets by a couple of snakes), the crazy set-pieces (I dare you not 
   to laugh at the loony pool player), frequent nudity (even Richard 
   Harrison get to screw a young woman) and, of course, the insane 
   dubbed dialogue (after transforming from snake demon back to human 
   form, Helen says to Jackie, &quot;Jackie, my arms are sore!&quot;). 
   I'm beginning to appreciate these Godfrey Ho pastiches, even if it's 
   for all the wrong reasons. You should dig this one, too. Also

   short SOV anthology film (47 minutes), a fictitious TV show made up 
   of three &quot;comic&quot; episodes, a wraparound episode, with fake 
   commercials between each episode, and think you are going to enjoy 
   it, you have another thing coming. The only positive aspect of this 
   poor, amateurish &quot;film&quot; is that it contains a bunch of 
   Italian genre personalities in cameo roles and most of them are no 
   longer with us. As a matter of fact, some of them passed away after 
   appearing in this piece of dreck, making it the last time we would 
   see them on film. It's not<A HREF="sick_o_pathics_1996.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sick-o-pathics dutch vhs front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="306" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>

    The wraparound episode, titled &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">Hellcome</FONT></B>&quot;,
    deals with a dreadlocked white dude named &quot;Max O'Keest&quot; (co-director
    Massimo F. Lavagnini; and c'mon now, groan!) walking down the street 
   pushing everyone who is walking the other way. He rips off the arm of 
   a young boy, just to get him to drop his lollipop, handing the arm to 
   the boy's mother (who beats Max with it!). He then sees homemade 
   signs of a pointing hand reading &quot;This Way&quot; and follows 
   them, ending up in the mansion of horror film director Dare Dane 
   (Dardano Sacchetti, one of Italy's best genre screenwriters, giving 
   us such films as <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Shock1977">SHOCK</A></B>

    BLADE IN THE DARK</A></B> - 1983; and many, many others). When Max 
   tells Dare Dane he hasn't seen any of his films, he knocks out Max 
   with his cane and when he wakes up, Max discovers he is tied to a 
   chair, Dare Dane forcing to watch his films, which he has on VHS. 
   What follows are three short comic horror films, complete with 
   cheesy, low-rent gore effects. After each episode, we are 
   &quot;privy&quot; to some of the worst fake TV commercials ever 
   committed to celluloid (if videotape can be considered such a thing).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The first film, titled &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">Hello Dolly</FONT></B>&quot;,
    finds an unnamed man, credited as the &quot;Rude Dude&quot; (Gianni 
   Tarquini), walking into a sex shop and asking the owner, Mr. Sinister 
   (Italy's premiere special effects master Sergio Stivaletti, who 
   directed <B><A HREF="wax_mask_1997.htm">THE WAX MASK</A></B> [1997] 
   after appearing in this piece of shit), if his package has arrived 
   yet. It has, but Mr. Sinister makes him sign a weird contract before 
   giving it to him (which he bleeds on, making Mr. Sinister very happy) 
   and letting him walk out the door with it. When the Rude Dude gets 
   home, we find out that the package is a female blow-up sex doll and 
   when he reaches into the box to pull it out, he gets a slimy 
   substance on his hands. Thinking that the sex doll is used, the Rude 
   Dud is disgusted, so he gets drunk, lies down in bed, reads a porno 
   magazine and falls asleep. The doll then inflates by itself and walks 
   towards the Rude Dude, where it ejaculates a semen-like substance out 
   of its twat and mouth all over the man. A long, penis-like creature 
   then shoots out of the doll's vagina and bites the Rude Dude on his 
   arm. He is then engulfed in a semen cocoon, as his body shrivels up. 
   The next day, a woman (the single monikered Chantal) walks into the 
   sex shop and Mr. Sinister hands her a package (and contract to sign). 
   It's a male blow-up doll that looks exactly like the Rude Dude. So 
   this is how sex dolls are made!?! The fake commercial that follows 
   this episode shows Lucio Fulci (!) shilling a new drink called 
   &quot;Lokula&quot;. He not only looks embarrassed shilling it, he 
   died a few months later!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next short film, titled &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">The Poor, 
   The Flesh And The Bag</FONT></B>&quot; concerns a poor man (Loris 
   Curci; producer/actor on <B><A HREF="zone_of_the_dead_2009.htm">ZONE 
   OF THE DEAD</A></B> - 2009) owing money to the big Drug Boss (late 
   director Renato Polselli, who gave us such gonzo films as <B><A HREF="#VampireBallerina60">THE
    VAMPIRE AND THE BALLERINA</A></B> - 1960; <B><A HREF="#Delirium1972">DELIRIUM</A></B> 
   - 1972; and <B><A HREF="#Mania1974">MANIA</A></B> - 1974). He gives 
   the poor man two days to pay up or he's dead, so he looks for some 
   way to make fast money. That opportunity comes when a woman (Mary 
   Rinaldi; dialogue writer for <B><A HREF="#FatalFrames1996">FATAL FRAMES</A></B> 
   [1996] a terrible movie many of the people in this &quot;film&quot; 
   also appeared in or worked on to some extant) leaves her briefcase in 
   a store and walks away without it. The poor man grabs it and takes it 
   back to his apartment, hoping to find something valuable inside it, 
   but he can't manage to open it. It turns out that the briefcase is 
   alive (extremely funny for the cheap way it is animated) and devours 
   the poor man, then turns its attention to the poor man's girlfriend 
   (Manuela Azzeroni), also devouring her. The briefcase returns to the 
   home of its female owner, who turns out to be a witch/cannibal! She 
   opens the briefcase, pulls out all the severed body parts inside it 
   and puts them in her refrigerator. She then leaves the briefcase in 
   another store and walks away without it. Next victim, please! The 
   commercial that follows this episode shows cannibalistic butcher

   looking completely ashamed doing it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The final short film in this completely wasted exercise in tedium, 
   and the longest of the three, is titled &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">Aeropophagus</FONT></B>&quot;,
    which is an unfunny take-off of Joe D'Amato's <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Anthropophagus1980">ANTHROPOPHAGUS</A></B> 
   (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="grim_reaper_1980.htm">THE GRIM REAPER</A></B> - 
   1980), that mimics some scenes verbatim, yet lacks any talent or 
   comedic performances, except for one person in particular. The first 
   scene, which matches exactly the first scene in D'Amato's flick, 
   shows a German couple walking down the narrow streets of an unnamed 
   Greek island, where they stop at a beach and the woman goes for a 
   swim in the ocean while the man relaxes on the beach and listens to 
   music on some rather large headphones. The woman sees a rubber raft 
   drifting aimlessly in the ocean and swims to it. When she looks 
   inside it, she dissolves in the water. We then see someone's POV as 
   they walk up to the oblivious man and farts in his face. We watch as 
   the flesh dissolves off the man's skull (more cheap comic gore 
   effects). Even his cassette player dissolves! (This is the only 
   really good scene, as it copies D'Amato's film verbatim, right down 
   to the couple speaking German to each other!). Cut to the present, 
   where Dr. Loonies (David Warbeck; <B><A HREF="beyond_1981.htm">THE BEYOND</A></B> 
   - 1981; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#FormulaMurder1985">FORMULA 
   FOR A MURDER</A></B> - 1985; in one of his final film performances) 
   tells patient Ricky (Ian Pavloc) that he has a disease worse than 
   cancer. It turns out Ricky likes to eat garbage out of trash cans and 
   also loves to smell shit-stained underwear. Dr. Loonies reveals to 
   Ricky that he is wearing red bikini underwear, as he tells a 
   frightened Ricky that he needs to examine him. Dr. Loonies decides to 
   shock Ricky by showing him the &quot;elephant trick&quot;, where he 
   reaches into the front of his red bikini briefs and pulls out his 
   penis, which looks like an elephant's trunk! (Why does he do this? I 
   don't know, but a game Warbeck pulls it off with comic aplomb). He 
   then tells Ricky that he needs a vacation on a small Greek island. As 
   Ricky is flying to the Greece airport, he throws up (there's a 
   not-so-sly reference to the &quot;Nightmare at 20,000 Feet&quot; 
   episode of <B><A HREF="twilight_zone_original_tv_series.htm">THE 
   TWILIGHT ZONE</A></B>) and the passenger sitting next to him (Marco 
   Antonio Andolfi, as &quot;Eddy Endolf&quot;; director/star of the 
   really strange <B><A HREF="#Cross 7 Jewels">THE CROSS OF SEVEN JEWELS</A></B> 
   - 1987) nearly passes out from the smell, but Ricky puts his face 
   into the barf bag and takes a giant whiff, a smile coming across his 
   face. Once on the island, a blind gypsy (Stefania Stella; <B><A HREF="fatal_frames_1996.htm">FATAL
    FRAMES</A></B> - 1996) tells Ricky that his odor is making the 
   residents flee the island. She tells him she experienced this once 
   before many years ago, when a shipwreck survivor, who survived on 
   rotten cans of beans from the sunken ship's hold, washed up on shore. 
   He was known as &quot;the Man with The Farts&quot; and the gypsy 
   tells Ricky that he's coming to get him. What does this all mean? You 
   got me, but this is the only time you will see a comic take-off of <B><A HREF="anthropophagus_1980.htm">ANTHROPOPHAGUS</A></B>.
    It's not really that funny (unless you find smelling used condoms 
   hilarious), but David Warbeck gives it his all, <A HREF="sick_o_pathics_1996.htm#DavidWarbeck">looking
    like he's having the time of his life</A>, which is what makes this 
   episode tolerable, but his appearance is regrettably short, as the 
   film ends with The Man With The Farts passing gas on a pregnant woman 
   (Lucio Fulci's daughter, Antonella Fulci) on the beach, forcing her 
   to abort her baby, who comes flying out of her vagina. He tries to 
   kill Ricky with his farts, but he enjoys the smell, so Fartman he 
   eats his own innards! This episode is followed by a commercial for 
   &quot;Dr. Riker's Hair Lotion&quot;, where actor Rick Gianasi 
   testifies that the hair treatment saved his career, displaying his 
   shiny long hair to an approving Linnea Quigley, who screams (they 
   would both appear in <B><A HREF="#FatalFrames1996">FATAL FRAMES</A></B>

    When the third short film ends, we see Max O'Keest break free from 
   his binds and tie Dare Dane to the chair, only this time, Dane is 
   facing the opposite way, unable to watch his own films, which he 
   dearly loves. The end credits then play, which includes a dedication

   - 2001), could hardly be called entertaining, but it is a hoot to see 
   all the genre personalities who agreed to appear in this trifle. It 
   makes me wonder if both directors had incriminating photos of these 
   personalities, forcing them to appear in this turd. It is plain to 
   see none of them (besides Warbeck) look like they are enjoying 
   themselves, but, as an historical artifact, it does hold some 
   importance to film viewers interested in Italian genre films. This 
   SOV atrocity is nearly impossible to find in physical form and 
   there's a reason for that. It is so bad, no one wants to release it, 
   because it would be a major money loser. It did manage to find its 
   way on VHS in Dutch-speaking countries from label Manic 
   Entertainment, but it is next to impossible to find. Consider that a 
   good thing because the amount of money asked for a copy is beyond 
   what any sane person would pay for it. I managed to catch a fairly 
   bad fullscreen print of it streaming on YouTube from user 
   &quot;Horrormania&quot;, so if you must watch this, hurry up, because 
   YouTube is going on a deletion spree, it may no longer be there if 
   you wait too long. This print is followed by footage taken at an 
   Italian horror convention, where people who worked on the film (and 
   some who didn't) praise this film as a comic masterpiece! Give me

    BOY</A><A NAME="Sonny Boy"></A> (1989) -</B> I still haven't figured 
   out this movie. Either it's one of the greatest put-ons ever 
   committed to film or a serious statement about child abuse. It begins 
   17 years ago when Weasel (Brad Dourif) steals a red Caddy (after 
   shooting the occupants) and brings it to Slue (big Paul L. Smith), 
   who runs a stolen property ring on the outskirts of a barren desert 
   town (filmed in Deming, New Mexico). Slue runs the town with an iron 
   fist, the sheriff (Steve Carlisle) and all the occupants bow to his 
   every whim or die. What Weasel doesn't realize is that there is a 
   baby boy in the backseat of the Caddy and when Slue finds it, he 
   wants to kill it or sell it. This doesn't sit well with Slue's wife, 
   Pearl (played by <A HREF="sonny_boy_photo.htm">David Carradine in drag</A>!),
    who wants to keep it and raise it as her (his?) own. Slue relents, 
   because he wants to keep Pearl happy, but practices a particular 
   brand of tough love to the baby, who everyone now calls &quot;Sonny<A HREF="sonny_boy3_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sonny boy poster small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="130" HEIGHT="208" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Boy&quot;. As the years pass, we watch as Slue whips Sonny, crucifies 
   him on a pole and sets a fire around him (to toughen up his skin!), 
   and finally cuts his tongue out. Cut to the present and Sonny Boy 
   (Michael Boston aka &quot;Michael Griffin&quot;) is a feral animal, 
   chained to a pole, filthy with tattered clothes. Slue uses Sonny for 
   some of his more violent robberies, setting Sonny free to kill and 
   eat Slue's robbery victims (including a priest, who tries to stop 
   Sonny from stealing a statue of Christ off a cross). Things begin to 
   go terribly wrong when Charlie (Sydney Lassick), one of Slue's 
   yes-men cronies, and Weasel use Sonny for one of their private 
   robberies, unknown to Slue. Sonny bites off the tip of Weasel's thumb 
   and escapes, making his way to the town and killing a woman who comes 
   on to him. The townspeople revolt and chase Sonny back to Slue's 
   home. The mob kill Slue and Pearl, setting fire to the compound. A 
   kindly doctor (Conrad Janis) saves Sonny, brings him home and 
   attaches a monkey tongue (!) to Sonny, where the first word out of 
   Sonny's mouth is &quot;No!&quot;. I haven't really begun to scratch 
   the surface of what this film has to offer the viewer. The acting is 
   uniformly excellent by a cast of veterans, the music moody (including 
   a haunting song titled &quot;Paint&quot;, written and performed by 
   Carradine), the photography (by Roberto D'Ettorre Piazzoli) elegant, 
   and everything else is above par. <B><A HREF="sonny_boy2_1989.htm">SONNY
    BOY</A></B> is likely to be one of your favorite films once you see

   in <B><A HREF="kill_bill_1&amp;2.htm">KILL BILL</A></B> (2003 -

    (Reatha Grey) to talk him out of it. The film then flashes back in 
   time to detail why Charles is in this predicament. Charles is a small 
   time dope dealer who is busted by brutal white cop Harry (Ben 
   Bigelow), who hates black people because his wife cheated on him with 
   a black dude. Harry viciously beats Charles in the back of his squad 
   car and caps it off by nearly castrating him with a straight razor. 
   Harry's partner, Jim (Stan Kamber), is the exact opposite of Harry, 
   but goes along with the beating because Harry is considered a hero in 
   the public's eye because he diffused a bomb at an airport. When 
   Charles is brought to trial, he is railroaded into prison by Harry's 
   false testimony and the legal manouevers of a crooked prosecuting 
   attorney. After three years in prison, Charles is released and learns 
   that everything on the outside is much different now. Drugs are 
   rampant, his girlfriend has been turned into a stripper by his best 
   friend and his younger brother has joined a street gang. Hoping to 
   stay on the straight and narrow, Charles gets a new girlfriend (and 
   later wife) in ex-prostitute Christina and tries repeatedly to get a 
   job, but time and time again he is unsuccessful. After seeing how 
   everyone from his past that have done him wrong are now doing so well 
   and seem to be prospering off of his misfortune, Charles decides some 
   payback is in order. Since his release from prison, Charles has 
   gained some unusual supernatural powers: The ability to get women to 
   do anything he says just by staring in their eyes and the truly 
   amazing ability to make his penis grow enormously long (I'm talking

   sincere) &quot;Bad Man Goes Straight&quot; drama (where, 
   surprisingly, not a single gunshot is fired), where we witness 
   Charles go through a series of setbacks, although he always manages 
   to maintain his composure thanks to the loving care of Christina. 
   That is, until the final third of the film. From the moment Charles 
   goes to the doctor to discuss is unusual &quot;condition&quot;, the 
   film takes a sudden U-turn into the surreal. His seduction of Harry's 
   wife (Tiffany Peters) right up to the subsequent penis strangulation 
   of the prosecuting attorney (where we finally see the full monstrous 
   monty in action) are classic moments of &quot;What The Fuck?&quot; 
   cinema. Christina's final word to Harry (which freeze frames at that 
   exact moment) is also unexpected but also rings true-to-life. It did 
   give me goosebumps. <B>S</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">OUL

    Alan is the coordinator of a secret project called 
   &quot;Intextus&quot;, in which professors and scientists the world 
   over are working on, but we are not privy to...yet. One day, Alan is 
   called into the office of Chancellor Hubbard (Bill Bolender), the 
   head of the institute financing Intextus. Hubbard tells Alan that he 
   must go to Budapest to talk to Professor Roth, who has cut off 
   communication with the institute. Alan has to try and talk to Roth 
   since only he could understand what the Professor has to say. Alan 
   agrees to go, not knowing that his life is about to take a deadly 
   turn, full of puzzles and, yes, labyrinths, of both the emotional and 
   physical kind, but why is a priest in Hubbard's office? (As Alan 
   leaves his office, Hubbard turns to the priest and says, &quot;Perhaps
    we should have told him everything.&quot;) Once in Budapest, Alan 
   meets one of Professor Roth's assistants, Genevieve (Paola Rinaldi), 
   who picks him up from the airport and drives him to the Professor's 
   house. Strange shit begins to happen almost immediately as Alan walks 
   to the Professor's back door, where a young boy on a swing stares at 
   him intensely and then seemingly disappears, the swing still moving. 
   Professor Roth's wife, Celia (Margareta Von Krauss), answers the 
   door, telling Alan to be gentle with her husband, as he has just had 
   a nervous breakdown. Alan then meets Professor Roth (Massimiliano 
   Pavone), who is deeply paranoid and wants Alan to prove to him he is 
   who he says he is. Alan hands a letter to the Professor that was 
   given to him by Chancellor Hubbard, who left implicit orders to give 
   it to the Professor.&nbsp; Once he reads the letter, Professor Roth 
   is satisfied and hands Alan an ancient tablet, telling Alan that it 
   contains all he needs to know about Intextus, but to tell no one that 
   he has it. A black ball then shatters a window in the room and lands 
   at Alan's feet. When Alan looks out the broken window to see where 
   the ball came from, he discovers that Professor Roth is no longer in 
   the room, as the ball seemed to scare him away (whenever the black 
   ball appears, someone will soon die). Celia then enters the room, 
   telling Alan that he should no longer have contact with her husband 
   because he is very ill. Alan, who is a no-nonsense type of guy, tells 
   Celia that he will return later that night and make up his mind for 
   himself whether this is all for nothing. When he leaves the House, 
   Genevieve is waiting for him, walking Alan to his hotel and telling 
   him that she lives across the street from the hotel (this is also 
   important). Once in the hotel's lobby, Alan meets the hotel's 
   mysterious owner, Mrs. Kuhn (Stephane Audran; <B><A HREF="faceless_1987.htm">FACELESS</A></B> 
   - 1987), and her always-present black cat. Why does everyone in the 
   lobby stare at Alan so intensely?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Alan then goes through a series of seemingly unrelated mysterious 
   events. First, there is a nameless stranger (William Berger; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Maya1988">MAYA</A></B> 
   - 1988), who seems to know exactly where Alan is going, warning him 
   to leave town immediately if he wants to live. Then he sees Genevieve 
   through his hotel room window stripping naked (surprising 
   full-frontal nudity), knowing he is watching and trying to turn him 
   on. We also glean a little bit of information on what Intextus is 
   about. Intextus seems to deal with an ancient religious sect whose 
   god seems to be some sort of giant spider, a sect that has been in 
   existence since 3000 BC, with members across the globe, yet it is so 
   secret, little to nothing has been written about it and anyone who 
   dares talk about it dies a horrible death (Alan says this to 
   Genevieve about the members of the sect when they are in a Turkish 
   bathhouse: &quot;Like an enormous cobweb, they are connected to each 
   other.&quot;). When Alan goes to talk to Professor Roth that night, 
   he discovers the police and some residents gathered around the house. 
   The police commissioner (Lazlo Sipo) escorts Alan into the house, 
   where he discovers Professor Roth dead, hanging by a rope in the 
   middle of the room, spider webs covering the rope. The police 
   commissioner asks Alan what he is doing here, Alan telling him that 
   he told the Professor's wife that he would be here that night. 
   &quot;That can't be.&quot;, says Genevieve (who is also in the room), 
   &quot;He was never married.&quot; Alan then tells the inspector about 
   the black ball, but when he goes to show him the window it came 
   through, the window is no longer broken. Is someone trying to frame 
   Alan or is something beyond his comprehension going on?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It doesn't take a genius to realize that Budapest is full of members 
   of this secret sect (they all have a scar on their arm in the shape 
   of a spider and we soon see firsthand how they got those scars!). 
   When hotel housekeeper Maria (Claudia Muzii) warns Alan to leave as 
   soon as possible, she is killed by what can best be described as a 
   spider woman (or a black widow, if you will, since she is dressed in 
   a flowing black gown and has wild red hair) who stabs the housekeeper 
   in the middle of her forehead with a large butcher knife after 
   chasing her through a labyrinth of hanging white sheets. Alan takes a 
   look at the tablet Professor Roth gave him, discovering two Polaroid 
   photos of the tablet inside it, with the name &quot;Polgar 
   Moricz&quot; written on the back of the photos. Genevieve tells Alan 
   that Polgar is the name of an antiques dealer and Alan is desperate 
   to talk to him, but it won't be easy, for the directions to his 
   antique shop in another labyrinth that Alan must navigate (a 
   well-filmed sequence). Alan gets to the antique shop too late, as the 
   spider woman has killed Polgar. Alan's fear of spiders gets a good 
   workout, especially in the WTF?!? finale, which can best be describes 
   as a hallucinogenic trip to the darker side of bizarre religious 
   rites. I guarantee this: Once you see it, you will never forget it. 
   Just who is this &quot;spider woman&quot;? Could it be someone that 
   Alan knows?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Even though the only actors recognizable in this film may be William 
   Berger and Stephane Audrane, everyone here does a remarkable job in 
   making us believe that all this supernatural horror is actually 
   happening. There are a few standout scenes that will make the hair on 
   the back of your neck stand up. The first one is when Alan and 
   Genevieve are having dinner in the hotel's dining room. Everyone in 
   the room have their eyes on Alan and when he starts talking about the 
   religious sect, they all silently get up and walk out, leaving Alan 
   and Genevieve the only ones in an empty dining room. Another 
   memorable scene happens when Alan hears housekeeper Maria scream when 
   she is being killed in the middle of the night. It leads Alan to a 
   windowless room, where Mrs. Kuhn is rocking an empty cradle, 
   describing to Alan how her young son died. This is extremely creepy, 
   an unforgettable exercise in pure terror. There is also a highly 
   effective sequence where the nameless stranger takes Alan to his 
   hideout, the catacombs beneath the city, where he explains to Alan 
   that the people in this sect are not human, they are 
   &quot;creatures&quot; who have walked this Earth for thousands of 
   years and they will kill anyone who threatens to expose them. He also 
   tells Alan that they haven't killed him yet because they want to make 
   him a member of their sect, He says to Alan that death is preferable 
   than to go<A HREF="spider_labyrinth_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/spider labyrinth italy poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   through one of the sect's rituals to turn human beings into 
   creatures. The spider woman then kills the stranger in a very unusual 
   way, while Alan tries to escape the catacombs, discovering the 
   remains of past human victims of the sect in the labyrinth-like 
   passageways of the catacombs. It is a sequence full of weird visuals 
   (What is a Volkswagen Beetle doing in the catacombs?) and terrifying 
   discoveries. But the standout sequence is the finale, which is part 
   gore, part stop-motion photography (!) and totally unnerving, thanks 
   to maestro Sergio Stivaletti's (<B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Demons1985">DEMONS</A></B> 
   - 1985; <B><A HREF="cemetery_man_1994.htm">CEMETERY MAN</A></B> - 
   1994) remarkable visual effects. You will see some outrageous 
   creations, such as a monster baby with spider mandibles on the top of 
   its head morphing into a giant spider (you have to see it to believe 
   it) and then showing us how those spider scars are created (it made 
   me flinch and that isn't easy). I have to thank my friend Steven for 
   turning me on to this film, because I always thought that Italian 
   horror films went straight down the crapper in the late-'80s. Thanks 
   for proving me wrong. This was director Gianfranco Giagni's only 
   genre film of note. I would have liked to see him direct more films 
   like this, as the majority of his other directorial output seems to 
   be TV and film documentaries. He shows a sure hand here, moving the 
   film at a brisk pace and not letting the viewer have a chance to 
   realize how improbable the story actually is. The screenplay was 
   written by Riccardo Aragno, Tonino Cervi (director/writer of <B><A HREF="queens_of_evil_1970.htm">QUEENS
    OF EVIL</A></B> - 1970; he was also this film's Producer), Cesare 
   Frugoni (<B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Screamers1980">SCREAMERS</A></B> - 
   1980) and Gianfranco Manfredi, much in the way of a great mystery, 
   only revealing something of importance to move the plot forward, 
   leaving the viewer begging for more. When everything is finally 
   revealed, you'll wish you never saw it, mainly because it is so 
   disturbing. There are no happy endings here.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    (director Lommel) escapes Germany during World War II to England 
   after Hitler (Lommel again) wants to use him to hypnotise the 
   populace to do his bidding. While London is being bombed, Sage is 
   cryrogenitically frozen with instructions not to be dethawed before 
   the time is right. Cut to the town of Paradise Hills, California ca. 
   1984, and the parents of punk rockers, homosexuals, prostitutes, etc. 
   try to straighten out their children using a device called the 
   &quot;Repentogram&quot;. The device works for about five minutes but 
   then the kids revert back to their usual ways. Frustrated, they have 
   one of the parents fly to London and thaw out Sage in hopes that his 
   powers will work in place of the Repentogram. Sage, at first, is in 
   awe at all the new inventions, including televisions, computers in 
   every home (the only thing Lommel got right in the future, even if he 
   was 15 years early), and all the modern conveniences. He begins 
   working on converting a homosexual and lesbian and his powers turn 
   them straight! Needless to say, he is a hit with the parents but 
   there will be a steep price to pay. What make this film so funny are 
   the frequent musical interludes that describe what Sage is doing to 
   the mind of these youngsters. The homosexual/lesbian sequence is so 
   funny/bad that I nearly peed my pants. He turns a Jim Morrison 
   lookalike from a rock 'n' roller into a folk singer who then throws 
   rock records into a bon fire in another laugh-out-loud sequence. The 
   parents think they now have the &quot;ultimate weapon&quot; in the 
   war on teenage rebellion, but they don't realize that teenage 
   rebellion has been going on forever and that's what shaped the world. 
   Lommel is so low-key in his role (He says, &quot;Most things that are 
   forbidden are the most fun&quot; before going bowling and playing 
   video games in another musical interlude!) that he is not so much an 
   imposing figure as a good guy just misunderstood. Some of the musical 
   numbers are good (especially the WWII number in London, which is 
   intercut with German bomber planes destroying the city), but most of 
   the numbers either fall flat or are unintentionally funny. If you are 
   in the mood for a good laugh, I recommend this film highly. Just 
   don't be looking for a good film. It's definitely cult material, just 
   not good cult material. Also starring Ken Letner, Thom Jones, 
   Geoffrey Barker, Cliff Brisbois, Ula Hedwig and a cameo by co-writer

   (1988) -</B> When one thinks of Andy Milligan, the thought of 
   intentional humor doesn't automatically spring to mind. Quite the

   fails on nearly every level. The acting is still uniformly awful and 
   the sets simple (bare, white cinderblock walls are the norm here), 
   but the camerawork is so static, it's like a filmed stage play, 
   proving that Milligan's heart wasn't in this (he was merely a hired 
   hand here) and was running on fumes. The story (if you can call it 
   that) is about the employees and patients of Goode Community Hospital 
   (the most understaffed and bare-bones hospital I have ever seen), run 
   by Dr. Grace Good<A HREF="surgikill_1988b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/surgikill vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>e
    (the single-monikered Bouvier, who is truly awful), as the hospital 
   tries to find a way to stop from closing down and being turned into a 
   shopping mall. This is the worst run hospital on record, as orderlies 
   keep spilling bedpans and urine on patients and the desk nurse, Rona 
   Ratchitt (Dan Foster-Jones in drag), cracks wise to the admitting 
   patients, their family and the staff over the public address system. 
   Trouble ensues when an escaped mental patient, Lizard Lips (Jim 
   Allen), roams the halls disguised as a doctor and begins killing the 
   patients and staff, while a new hire, 16 year-old Dr. Albert 
   Schweitzer (Doug Eames, who sucks on a giant pacifier he wears around 
   his neck), learns the ropes from Dr. Goode, Dr. Harvey (Michael 
   Lunsford) and Dr. Fine (Al Silver), who are all just as inept as they 
   come. As more patients end up dead or injured (one patient explodes 
   when her anesthesia tank is substituted with an acetylene tank; 
   another patient is castrated; another is pushed down a flight of 
   stairs; and still another is hung by the neck), Dr. Goode and her 
   staff cover-up the crimes for fear the bad publicity will shut their 
   doors (Well, duh!), Too many patients end up dead to go unnoticed, 
   though, as the relative of one dead patient threatens to sue and 
   Nurse Ratchitt turns out to be Dr. Goode's only surviving male 
   relative, who wants to kill Dr. Goode and take over the hospital. 
   Folks, this is the longest 88 minutes I have ever experienced, as the 
   jokes fall flatter than Olive Oyl's chest and the pacing is slower 
   than a loved one's funeral.&nbsp; This is truly painful to watch, as 
   the script, written by Milligan, never rises above the schtick a 
   third-rate Jewish comedian would perform in the Borscht Belt of the 
   Catskill Mountains in the 50's &amp; 60's (Most of the jokes here 
   would make Henny Youngman wince. Yes, they're that bad.). Those 
   expecting Andy Milligan's patented gorefest (including such films as <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#TortureDungeon1970">TORTURE

   only real instance of gore happens when the female patient explodes 
   [offscreen] and obvious animal guts and intestines are thrown on 
   everyone in the operating room) and the acting (including an 
   undertaker that looks and acts like Oliver Hardy!) is even broader 
   (and brutally terrible) than normal. I honestly can't imagine what 
   Milligan was thinking when he was making this, as it is desperate 
   even by his standards (Maybe he was experiencing the early effects of 
   AIDS). Even as a little-seen relic, <B><A HREF="surgikill_1988.htm">SURGIKILL</A></B>

   (1978) -</B> Before I proceed with the review, I first must explain 
   why I am being kinder to this film than most no-budget junk that 
   riddled the video store shelves in the 80's. This is one of those 
   rare films where a bunch of teens in Utah decided to make a horror 
   film without any knowledge of how to do so and actually achieved 
   their dream, if their dream consisted of making a horror film that 
   contains absolutely no blood, nudity or foul language. And then get a 
   deal to have it released on home video! It's actually a throwback to 
   the sci-fi/horror films of the 50's, when none of that stuff was 
   needed to tell a story. <B>TEENALIEN</B> is most certainly an awful 
   film, but it is fascinating to watch. The film opens in the late 50's 
   with old man Dobbs (Keith Nelson, whose idea of acting is to lick his 
   lips and continuously wipe his face with his hands) making his

   red glowing eyes lumbers outside his cabin. Dobbs hears a loud 
   buzzing sound outside, so he grabs his squeeze and checks out the 
   commotion, only to witness an alien spacecraft rising from behind a 
   building known as the Old Mill. The spaceship flies directly overhead 
   of Dobbs and emits a green ray, whose purpose seems to be to 
   evaporate the squeeze liquor in the jar Dobbs is holding (Maybe the 
   aliens needed a drink before their long trip). Twenty years later, 
   teenager Carl (Michael Dun<A HREF="varrow_mission_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/varrow mission vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>n)
    is looking for a house to put on a Halloween spook show, so kindly 
   old-timer Mr. Cranston (Vern Adix), the owner of the Old Mill, offers 
   it to Carl to use free of charge. Carl is a little reticent about 
   accepting the offer because the Old Mill is said to be haunted (a 
   flashback to 100 years earlier shows the red-eyed alien killing the 
   dog of a couple of miners when it enters an open window of the Old 
   Mill), but Mr. Cranston talks him into it. This doesn't sit too well 
   with Carl's rival, Tony (Dan Harville), who was planning to put on a 
   spook show of his own, but there is no way he can compete with the 
   Old Mill. Tony gets some unexpected help from a nameless white-haired 
   teen (Mike McClure, who is as stiff as a mahogany headboard), who 
   offers to help Tony and his gang scare Carl and his friends out of 
   using the Old Mill. Carl and his friends, which includes the hulking 
   Tiny (Dale Angell), begin to get the musty Old Mill ready for the 
   spook show and discover some creepy mannequins in a closet that are 
   made from some unknown material, so they decide to use them as props 
   in the show. After also discovering some strange bones (that make 
   strange metallic sounds when dropped) and a hidden tunnel that leads 
   to a secret laboratory, it becomes obvious to Carl that there's more 
   going on here than meets the eye. When members of Carl's crew begin 
   being abducted by mysterious figures wearing black hooded robes, Carl 
   and his friends must uncover the truth before it becomes too late. Of 
   course, the people in the hooded robes turn out to be Tony and his 
   friends, but that strange white-haired teen turns out to be something 
   more sinister: an alien called a Varrow, who has come to Earth on a 
   mission to take over our planet because theirs is overpopulated 
   (Which begs the question: Why would they wait over a hundred years to 
   do so?). Carl discovers the truth, as the Varrow transforms itself to 
   its normal big red bug-eyed self and chases Carl and everyone elser 
   around the Old Mill. Can Carl and younger brother Mike (Chad Bennion) 
   convince the police that this isn't a Halloween prank before more 
   Varrows arrive on Earth?&nbsp; Also known as <B><A HREF="varrow_mission_1978b.htm">THE
    VARROW MISSION</A></B>, first (and only)-time director/producer 
   Peter Semelka tries his damnedest to give this film a &quot;Hey gang, 
   let's put on a show!&quot; atmosphere, but the amateur acting, bad 
   cinematography (which mainly consists of medium and long shots) and 
   out-of-place music score doom the project from the start. The 
   screenplay, by Semelka and executive producer James Crofts (based on 
   a story by Ed &amp; Sherma Yeates), has some decent ideas, but the 
   paltry budget is unable to communicate those ideas in an effective 
   manner. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely fun watching everyone 
   trying their hardest to communicate those ideas, but it fails at 
   every turn, making this film akin to watching the after effects of a 
   bad car wreck as you slowly drive by it. The majority of the film is 
   nothing but teens mucking about the Old Mill wearing various 
   Halloween costumes, but there are a few creepy scenes, including the 
   arrival of a female Varrow (Judy Richards); the transformation of the 
   male Varrow from human to alien (which is nearly ruined by Mike 
   McClure's horrible acting ability); and the revelation that the 
   Varrow have been living amongst us for decades (one is even a local 
   cop), which leads to an <B><A HREF="invasion_of_the_body_snatchers_1956.htm">INVASION

   fairly unknown black and white Italian film of the perverse will show 
   you where D'Amato got his impetus to make his gore epic. While not 
   nearly as gory as D'Amato's flick, this film is sleazy to the extreme 
   (it may be the sleaziest '60s film I have ever seen and I've seen 
   plenty!), with bursts of graphic violence that will surprise viewers. 
   It is also adult in its depictions of sex, love and death, so much 
   so, that it should open the eyes of genre enthusiasts wider than they

    The film opens with young Count Mino Alberti (Franco Nero; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#Keoma1976">KEOMA</A></B>

   Sunbeauty&quot;, a literal translation of her Italian name), who 
   hates Laura with every ounce of her rather large body. Laura hands 
   the flowers over to the maid, Marta (Gioia Pascal), who destroys them 
   when Laura leaves the room, because she has had the hots for Mino 
   since she was a child. Mother Alberti keeps close tabs on her son; 
   she even has a secret peephole she uses to spy on her son in his 
   bedroom! Laura is about to leave for a few days to visit her sister 
   in Switzerland (Mother Alberti makes a snotty remark to Laura, 
   basically calling her a liar, comparing her trip to a servant asking 
   for a few days off to visit a sick relative, telling Laura it is just 
   an excuse for lazy workers to get a few days off) and Mino wants to 
   have sex with her before she leaves, but Laura is not in the mood and 
   finds Mino's unrelenting advances quite troublesome (telling him, 
   &quot;I feel uncomfortable living with you in this house.&quot;). 
   Marta mentions to Mother Alberti that when Laura returns from this 
   trip, she will marry Mino and she will no longer be living with her 
   son because Laura won't let him, so Mother Alberti makes a comment, 
   saying wouldn't it be nice if she never returned? Marta knows exactly 
   what she means and we then see Marta cutting the brake line on 
   Laura's car!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then discover that Mino is a taxidermist (just as in D'Amato's 
   film), his specialty being birds (There is a scene of Mino preparing 
   a dead bird for taxidermy with him cutting into its body with a 
   scalpel and then removing its internal organs with his hands. It's as 
   graphic as any gore scene I have witnessed, even though it is in 
   black and white!). While Mino is working in his laboratory, Marta 
   tells Laura that Mino went away and will not be able to see her off, 
   so Laura decides to leave early, saying goodbye to Mother Alberti, 
   getting in her car and driving off, down the steep mountain road, 
   full of dangerous sharp curves. When Mino discovers Laura left early 
   (look at the sly grin on Marta's face when she tells him), he jumps 
   in his car and tries to catch up with her (Even though we know what 
   is going to happen, this sequence is white knuckle suspense at its 
   finest). Mino catches up with Laura and starts beeping his horn, but 
   when Laura tries to stop her car, she discovers she has no brakes and 
   Mino watches helplessly as Laura's car rolls down a steep embankment 
   to the ocean below. Mino runs down the embankment and discovers 
   Laura's dead body hanging out of her wrecked car, her head under the 
   water (Mino cries out, &quot;No! No! No! Noooo!&quot;).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At the same time this is taking place, Marta and Mother Alberti get 
   into a heated argument and Mother Alberti orders Marta to pack up her 
   things and leave the house immediately, she is no longer in her 
   employ. While Marta begs to keep her job, she accidentally (?) pushes 
   the frail Mother Alberti down a flight of stairs, which results in a 
   deep cut on the side of Mother Alberti's face (very graphic). Since 
   she is someone to take advantage of a situation, Marta strangles 
   Mother Alberti with her bare hands.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When a despondent Mino returns home, he discovers that his day is 
   about to get much worse. He opens the front door to discover Marta 
   crying uncontrollably (crocodile tears), while the police inform him 
   that his mother has died in a &quot;tragic accident&quot; (A doctor 
   tells Marta that she is to stick close by Mino because he is going to 
   need her more than ever. Marta then stops crying and give a 
   shit-eating grin that will send shivers down your spine!). It is at 
   this time Mino's mind snaps, telling Marta that his laboratory is to 
   remain locked and never opened again (&quot;I don't want to see these 
   birds anymore! Nobody may go inside there! Nobody!&quot; Pay 
   attention to the stuffed owl in Mino's laboratory. It explains the 
   passage of time expertly and eerily.). It is obvious (after a short 
   while) why Mino wants no one in his laboratory. What is shown in 
   D'Amato's film is only hinted at here. Mino then goes into his 
   bedroom and collapses on his bed, as a finely edited sequence shows 
   us what is going through Mino's mind, making it clear that his mind 
   has snapped into madness.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next time we have seen Mino, a year has passed and he's sitting 
   in a nightclub watching a female trumpet player (!) and a band 
   playing a tune. The hostess announces that exotic dancer Marie Margot 
   (Marina Morgan; <B><A HREF="sheriff_of_rock_springs_1971.htm">THE 
   SHERIFF OF ROCK SPRINGS</A></B> - 1971) is about to perform and Mino 
   watches rapt as she does an erotic striptease (while we see no 
   nudity, it's still very daring for its time). We then see that Mino 
   has brought her home with him. He takes her into his 
   &quot;special&quot; bedroom and tells her to take off her clothes. 
   She takes them off (at least down to her bra and panties) and notices 
   a bouquet of dead flowers and some dead birds in the room, but thinks 
   nothing of it. She then gets down to business with a fully dressed 
   Mino on a bed, but when she turns her head, she lets out an 
   ear-piercing scream (for some reason, this part of the sequence 
   changes from Italian to German language, but for less than a minute). 
   We then see Mino choking the life out of Marie with his bare hands, 
   while the taxidermied body of Laura lies on a bed next to them. Marta 
   hears the screams and runs into the room, finding Marie's dead body 
   and Laura's corpse. Knowing full well that she has Mino just where 
   she wants him, she half-heartedly tells Mino that they should contact 
   the police, but when a crying Mino begs her to help him, she says 
   they will have to re-open his laboratory and fully dispose of Marie's 
   body in his vat of hydrochloric acid (off-screen, unlike D'Amato's film).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see that Mino is interested in taxidermy again and, in a 
   very telling scene, we see him torturing a live parrot with a wooden 
   rod. The next time we see the parrot, it is dead and stuffed, only 
   this time Mino treats it like a friend, petting its feathers like it 
   was a dog (showing us the stark difference about his feelings for the 
   living and the dead). Taking Marta's advice, Mino goes out to break 
   up the monotony of his life, picking up a prostitute named Loredana 
   (Gara Granda; <B><A HREF="barbarella_1968.htm">BARBARELLA</A></B> - 
   1968), giving her an enormous amount of money and bringing her home 
   to his special bedroom. Just like Marie, Mino strangles her in the 
   bed. He tells Marta, &quot;I have killed again. It's as though 
   suddenly I had a third eye. The third eye, it always stares in the 
   same direction.&quot; Marta knows she now has Mino over a barrel, 
   telling him if he wants her help, &quot;You listen to me now. Since I 
   was brought into this world, I only took orders. I worked like a 
   slave. I also grew up in this house and I saw wealth all around me, 
   out of my reach. I was no more than an employee to all of you. But 
   that's over now. Now...you must come to grips with life on your own. 
   Whatever I want, that's what you said, no? Say it again [he does]. I 
   will stay, Mino...on one condition. I want to be your wife. You are 
   sick, Mino, and you know it. I also know there is no cure. It would 
   be deception not to realize that. You will always need new 
   sacrifices. Only a woman who shares everything with you can 
   understand you and will be able to help you. I will be an 
   understanding wife to you, for better or worse. What do you say?&quot;
    Mino, of course agrees to her demands, but neither of them are 
   prepared for what happens next.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That would be Laura's sister Diana (Erika Blanc again), who is the 
   spitting image of Laura. She has come to Villa Alberti to talk to 
   Mino and hopefully find the body of her missing sister. When Marta 
   sets sights on her as she steps out of her car, she is horrified, not 
   because Diana looks exactly like Laura, but knowing that her 
   impending marriage to Mino is now over. She tries to get Diana to 
   leave by telling her that Mino is on a trip and won't be back for 
   quite some time, but Mino, who has just returned from hunting (for 
   more birds to taxidermy), walks out of the woods, sets sight on Diana 
   and thinks Laura has returned to him. Mino informs Marta that they 
   can no longer get married because he is about to marry Laura, so 
   there is no longer any room in his life for her. Marta reminds him 
   that Laura is dead and so is his mother, but Mino, who is quite mad, 
   tells Marta, &quot;Get out of my house! Go away! Get out of here, 
   immediately! Liar! Liar!...Liar! Liar!&quot; As you would expect, 
   Marta is having none of this, so she grabs a butcher knife out of the 
   kitchen drawer and goes into Diana's bedroom to kill her. Marta 
   accidentally knocks something over on Diana's night table, waking her 
   up and all Marta can do is slash one of Diana's palms before she runs 
   away, Marta in close pursuit. Diana hides in Mino's special bedroom 
   and discovers the stuffed body of her sister (as well as some kind of 
   insect that tries to bite her hand, in a scene that will have you 
   rewinding it several times). Just as Marta is about to kill Diana, 
   Mino grabs the knife out of her hands and viciously stabs Marta 
   repeatedly in the stomach (It's about as strong a scene you will 
   witness in any 1960's production). Knowing that Diana has seen her 
   sister's body (or perhaps he doesn't know), he places her unconscious 
   body in his car and drives off. When she wakes up and hears Mino call 
   her Laura, telling her he is taking her to a special place to get 
   married, Diana knows she must escape, but Mino keeps her at bay with 
   a pistol he keeps in his jacket pocket. Mino stops at a gas station 
   when he notices the tank is almost empty and Diana quietly throws 
   Mino registration papers out the car window as they leave. An 
   attendant at the station finds the papers and calls the police (This 
   is Italy and you should know you should never be without your 
   registration papers). In the film's most intense scene, the police 
   phone Mino's house and we discover that Marta is not quite dead, but 
   the ringing telephone is on the other side of the room and a 
   seriously wounded Marta must crawl to it. When the phone stops 
   ringing, it looks like Marta has missed the call, but the policeman 
   phones again (just in case he called the wrong number the first time) 
   and Marta makes it to the phone. The police arrive at the house and 
   Marta tells them everything (blaming Mino for everything, telling 
   them, &quot;Find him. Find the murderer!&quot;) just before she dies.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The police put an all points bulletin (APB) on Mino's car and we 
   then see that Mino has taken Diana to the beach by the ocean and he's 
   quite crazy, telling Diana, &quot;We will spend the night together, 
   the longest night we've ever known. Just us alone. You and me.&nbsp; 
   Brighten up, brighten up, little candle. Life is no more than 
   fleeting shadows. A wonderful fairytale designed for idiots. 
   Everything is noise and fireworks with no meaning. I can already 
   smell the scent of the sea. But there is nothing I prefer to the 
   scent of you, Laura!&quot; Diana tells him Laura is dead, but Mino 
   puts his hands over his ears, because he doesn't want to hear it. 
   Diana tries to run away, but Mino tackles her in the sand and rips 
   the clothes off her body. A squad of police with flashlights arrive 
   (a well composed sequence) and stops Mino from raping Diana, Mino 
   telling the police that Diana kidnapped him after killing his maid, 
   not knowing that Marta already spilled the beans on him. The head 
   detective plays along and puts Mino in the back of his car, not even 
   bothering to handcuff him, telling an officer it will not be 
   necessary, it will only take a few minutes to clear this up. As they 
   drive away, Mino thinks he got away with it all, not knowing that he 
   is about to have a rude wakeup call when he arrives at the station. 
   The film ends on this note.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    the '60s.&nbsp; Very adult in its approach and full of unflinching 
   brutality, this may be my favorite Franco Nero performance of his 
   long and storied career (Nero says that this was the film that got 
   him noticed as a serious actor). He's absolutely amazing as a man 
   driven to insanity by an overbearing mother and a skewed sense of 
   love because of it, giving him no moral center at all. As a matter of 
   fact everyone here is terrific. There's not a false note in any of 
   the performances. I particularly liked the way Erika Blanc gave her 
   two characters different personalities. Laura is serious and abrupt 
   while Diana is bubbly and trusting. She has always impressed me, no 
   matter what role she plays. I was also surprised to discover that 
   actress Gioia Pascal never appeared in anything else after starring 
   in this. She is excellent as the conniving Marta and I would be very 
   interested to learn why she gave up acting. Director Mino Guerrini (<B><A HREF="date_for_a_murder_1967.htm">DATE

   by focusing on his eyes rolling into the back of his head as his face 
   hits the camera lens, making this film a feast for the eyes as well 
   as the brain. As much as I'm a fan of Joe D'Amato's film, I have to 
   admit that I like this one better, because instead of showing us 
   unrated gore, as D'Amato's film does, it deals with the violence in 
   more literal terms, using dialogue and some finely-tuned camera shots 
   (such as the stuffed owl showing us the progress of time, simply by 
   putting cobwebs on it). I think I have discovered my new favorite 
   film and believe me when I say that doesn't come along too often. If 
   Franco Mannino's (&quot;Frank Mason&quot; in the credits) music score

    A man wearing dark sunglasses and a black hat watches a funeral at a 
   cemetery in his car in the pouring rain. He then picks up a woman on 
   the side of the road, who asks him for a ride to town. She notices a 
   short time later that he is not heading towards town, foolishly 
   thinking that he is taking a shortcut. He stops his car by some 
   barren woods, puts on some black gloves and tries to assault the 
   women, but she gets out of the car and runs into the forest (Pay 
   close attention to the ground. In one scene there is heavy snow on 
   the ground and the next scene shows some nice green grass!). The man 
   runs after her and she thinks she has gotten away, hiding behind a 
   tree. She then walks into an open field and, suddenly, the man jumps 
   at her, ripping off her coat (Where in the hell did he come from? 
   It's an open field for Christ's sake, don't you think she would have 
   seen him coming? Remember what I said about tossing aside all logic? 
   Maybe I should practice what I preach!). The woman breaks free and 
   runs into the barren forest once again (The forest is so barren, we 
   can see a crew member's hand holding a branch so the camera can get a 
   shot of the killer's POV as he approaches the woman. I can't make 
   this shit up!). The woman cowers as the killer comes closer to her 
   because she trapped with nowhere to run. She begs the man not to hurt 
   her because she's engaged (!), saying, &quot;I am only 17, that would 
   ruin me. Show some mercy, please!&quot; (If she's 17, I'm a freakin' 
   infant!). The man ogles her body, spending way too much time looking 
   at her legs and she begs for mercy one final time, then unbuttoning 
   her blouse and taking off her skirt, standing in front of the man in 
   her white bra and panties, the man not uttering a single word (How in 
   the hell did she know he wanted sex? Oh, nevermind!).&nbsp; We then 
   see the man climbing on top of the woman's topless body as she lies 
   on the ground, a straight razor in his hand. He then slashes her body 
   repeatedly as a plane flies overhead.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then watch the plane land at the airport and one of the 
   passengers is Mine (Meral Zeren), who is greeted by her diplomat 
   husband, Metin (Nihat Zeyalan), who says that the trip to Europe must 
   have been good for her nerves because she looks good. Mine tells him 
   it would have been better if he were there with her, but he tells her 
   that his government position hardly leaves him time to even think 
   about her (Ah, husbands and wives!). We slowly begin to realize that 
   Mine went to Europe to get away from her violent illicit lover Tarik 
   (Yildirim Gencer; <B><A HREF="spy_smasher_1968.htm">SPY SMASHER</A></B> 
   - 1968), who would slap her around when they made love. As Metin and 
   Mine are leaving the airport, their car is stopped by the police, who 
   ask to see their papers, telling them that a woman had been raped and 
   murdered near the airport and before she died, the woman told the 
   police that her attacker had a huge scar on his right cheek. Mine 
   then has a flashback where she is sexually assaulted by Tarik in the 
   rain and she fights back, cutting his right cheek with a broken 
   bottle. Could Tarik be the killer or is that too easy? In Turkey, 
   nothing is too easy.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Mine and Metin arrive home, Metin taking a shower and Mine getting 
   ready for bed, when there's a knock on the door. A deliveryman hands 
   her a bouquet of flowers and the card reads, &quot;I am so glad you 
   came home. I can't wait to hold you in my arms.&quot; If any of this 
   sounds like d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, don't fret, as you are about to 
   experience a whole lot more, only it's not going to be like any 
   d&eacute;j&agrave; vu you ever experienced before. It's akin to 
   remembering a delicious meal at an expensive restaurant, only this 
   time you'll be eating a Big Mac with a side of fries to go. That's 
   the best way to describe this film. It may be copying Sergio 
   Martino's excellent giallo film, only this time it is being done with 
   a crazy Turkish slant. In other words, made with a budget that 
   couldn't afford that expensive dinner at a fancy restaurant, barely 
   able to pay for that burger and fries. I'm not going to explain the 
   rest of the plot because all you have to do is read my review of <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#StrangeViceWardh71">THE
    STRANGE VICE OF MRS. WARDH</A></B> (click on link), but what I will

   means right, up means down and logic is only for crazy people.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    For one thing, the party that Mine and best friend Oya (Eva Bender; <B><A HREF="tarkan_versus_the_vikings_1971.htm">TARKAN
    VERSUS THE VIKINGS</A></B> - 1971) go to does contain women who 
   playfully tear each other's clothes off (their clothing is made of 
   paper!), but when Mine meets Oya's &quot;philandering&quot; friend 
   Yilmaz (Kadir Inanir; <B><A HREF="baskin_1972.htm">BASKIN</A></B> - 
   1972), he calls Oya &quot;bandy-legged&quot;, so she lifts up her 
   skirt and asks if her legs look bandy and then accuses Yilmaz of 
   tricking her into exposing herself to strangers! Mine's flashbacks 
   with ex-lover Tarik are much more violent than those in Martino's 
   film, yet the nudity is kept to a bare (pardon the pun) minimum, just 
   quick (micro-seconds, really) flashes of Mine's breasts and lots of 
   sweaty naked backs. The slashing death of the poor nameless girl in 
   the shower shows precious little nudity, but the blood flows rather 
   freely. Even the scene where Metin meets Tarik outside the party, 
   where Tarik is about to slash Mine with a broken champagne bottle, 
   ends differently. Instead of punching him out, as in Martino's film, 
   Metin slaps him hard across the face. I guess in Turkey, a slap is 
   far more hurtful and emasculating than a punch. There's even a <A HREF="thirsty_for_love_sex_and_murder_1972.htm#BeheadingPhoto">beheading</A> 
   that proves to be fake! But I digress. The major difference between 
   Martino's flick and this film is the ending. Instead of ending with a 
   proper conclusion, here Yilmaz dodges bullets by doing cartwheels and 
   other acrobatic feats, picking up a pistol on the <A HREF="thirsty_for_love_sex_and_murder_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/thirsty for love, sex and murder turkey poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>floor
    and shooting the gang of men trying to kill him. It ends suddenly 
   when the police show up and thank Yilmaz for doing their job! You 
   really have to see it to believe it.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This film is like a Cliff Notes version of Martino's film, only the 
   men sport sideburns that could be mistaken for small furry animals 
   and some of the hairstyles, especially on the men, look totally 
   inappropriate. I don't know if this was a &quot;thing&quot; in Turkey 
   at the time, but one man sports a hairstyle that looks like it was 
   fashioned for a head twice his size! Let's not forget that when Metin 
   breaks down a door, it not only opens up, it also falls off its 
   hinges! In the annals of copycat cinema, this film ranks up there 
   like no other I have ever seen (it even contains the song &quot;Sealed
    With A Kiss&quot;!), especially since it is copying a film hardly 
   anyone has ever heard of before. Is it good? No. Is it entertaining? 
   Hell yes! So what are you waiting for?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   that is on the Onar DVD, which is in anamorphic widescreen, but far 
   from perfect. There is plenty of emulsion damage, fading colors and 
   some missing frames, but it is perfectly fitting, considering the 
   topic. I have yet to see any Turkish film that is in pristine 
   condition, especially from the early-'70s. They were quickly shot and 
   then forgotten about, no consideration taken into preserving the 
   prints, which is why 80% of all Turkish genre films are now 
   considered lost. It's too bad that Onar didn't get the recognition it 
   so richly deserved, because Bill did his best to rescue Turkish genre 
   films from total oblivion and after Bill died and Onar faded into the 
   ether, no one else picked up the mantle to rescue more Turkish genre 
   films, which is why most of them that are available look so beat up.

   film that should be viewed with a group of friends with a twisted

    outrageousness. Simply put, this is a story about a little girl 
   named Ting Ting and her intelligent pet snake Mozlar, who grows 
   larger and larger thanks to a top secret experimental formula dubbed 
   the &quot;Thunder Project&quot; but, as with most of Godfrey Ho's 
   patchwork films, the majority of fun to be had here is in the 
   hilarious English (actually Australian) dubbing and cockeyed 
   storytelling, not to mention the incredibly chintzy special effects. 
   Dr. Lee has created a formula that can make plant life grow up to 300 
   times it's normal size, thereby eliminating world hunger, but when 
   the military confiscates the formula to test it on reptile life (they 
   test it on a frog and it instantly grows huge, but nowhere near 300 
   times) and a group of terrorists invade the facility, a lone female 
   scientist grabs the formula and escapes in a car. When she gets into 
   an accident and the formula is ejected from the car (it's kept in a 
   Plexiglas case), a young girl named Ting Ting (Who was just being 
   teased by a couple of boys, who tell her, &quot;You're the worst 
   because you're a girl!&quot;) finds it and decides it would make a 
   good cage for her pet snake Mozlar (Who nods it's head yes and no to 
   Ting Ting's questions; an effect obviously achieved by tying fishing 
   line around a live snake's head and pulling on it!). As soon as 
   Mozlar is put in the cage, he grows about twenty times it's normal 
   size, dwarfing Ting Ting and forcing her to sneak it out of her 
   bedroom (her parents don't want her having a normal size snake, never 
   mind a giant one!) and keeping him in a shed in her backyard (it's 
   small on the outside, but big as a warehouse on the inside!). Mozlar 
   and Ting Ting become very close (they toss a beach ball back and 
   forth and Mozlar saves her from a falling tree), but she has a hard 
   time hiding her giant friend, because every time he comes into 
   contact with electricity, he grows bigger and bigger. In the newly 
   shot footage, which cuts into the film proper every 15 minutes or so, 
   government agent Ted Fast (Pierre Kirby; star of Ho's <B><A HREF="full_metal_ninja_1988.htm">FULL

   Solomon (Edowan Bersmea; Ho's <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#ZombieVsNinja">ZOMBIE
    VS. NINJA</A></B> [1988], also starring Kirby) from getting his 
   hands on the formula, which leads to several gunfights, usually 
   resulting in Solomon's goons being riddled with bullets. To make a 
   long story short, the terrorists kidnap Ting Ting and hold her in a 
   highrise building. Mozlar, who is now truly gigantic, wraps his body 
   around the outside of <A HREF="terror_serpent_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/terror serpent aka thunder of giant serpent german poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>the
    building, searching floor-by-floor for his best friend (and killing 
   innocent bystanders with falling debris!), while her parents wait 
   nervously outside. The military send in some fighter jets to kill 
   Mozlar, not understanding that he only wants to save the little girl. 
   Mozlar dies in the same manner as King Kong, Ting Ting throws a hissy 
   fit and Ted finally meets Solomon face-to-face, killing him with a 
   couple of bullets to his chest.&nbsp; I found myself laughing out 
   loud hysterically on several occasions, usually whenever Mozlar and 
   Ting Ting are on-screen. In his early growing stages, Mozlar grunts 
   like a chimpanzee and, when he's fully grown, he roars like a lion! 
   Any electrical shock will make him grow, so when the plot calls for 
   it, Mozlar is hit with a lightning bolt (which also gives him flying 
   powers!) and then zapped by a homemade electric fence built by the 
   extremely inept terrorists. The amazing snake effects are realized by 
   full-sized puppet mock-ups (Believe me, you haven't lived until 
   you've seen Ting Ting take a ride on the back of Mozlar's head!) 
   until the final stage, which is done on obvious miniature sets and 
   blue screen work. I was sitting there slack-jawed at the cheesiness 
   of it all. This also contains all the standard Godfrey Ho (who 
   directed as &quot;Charles Lee&quot; and scripted as &quot;Benny 
   Ho&quot;) trademarks: Badly-matched old and new footage; hilarious 
   dubbed dialogue (When one of Solomon's goons informs him that they 
   have lost the formula, he replies, &quot;Brilliant deduction, 
   Sherlock!&quot;), exaggerated sound effects and the same park 
   location as in all his other patchwork films. There's also the sight 
   of kids practicing the sport of roller skiing down a grassy hill (Why 
   didn't this catch on?). The woman who dubs Ting Ting's voice is 
   really annoying, especially the extended screaming/crying jag she 
   goes through in the finale. If I were her father, I believe a hard 
   slap to her face would have been called for. She also can't seem to 
   make up her mind if her pet snake's name is &quot;Mozlar&quot; or 
   &quot;Martha&quot;, as she calls it both. Still, this is an oddly 
   entertaining mixture of sickly sweet family drama, bloody shoot 'em 
   up action and giant monster genres. Ignore all of Ho's new footage 
   and enjoy the tale of a girl and her giant snake. I certainly did.

   Ted and Paco discover a hidden door; behind it lies a fully intact

   can only be described as alien artifacts in the ship's cargo hold.

    Farm girl Brigitta (Brigitte Castor) is attacked by a very ugly 
   vampire when getting water for the cows at a local waterfall (it is a 
   multiple cascading waterfall that is very beautiful and even hypnotic 
   to watch, as it is used several times in this film). The male 
   farmhands hear Brigitta's screams and come running to her, finding 
   her unconscious and bringing her to the house of the Professor (Pier 
   Ugo Gragnani), where a company of female ballet dancers are residing 
   and rehearsing a new ballet. The dancers are being tutored by Giorgio 
   (Gino Turini, as &quot;John Turner&quot;; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#SSHellCamp1977">SS
    HELL CAMP</A></B> - 1977) and the company is headed by Luca (Isarco 
   Ravaioli; Polselli's <B><A HREF="#Mania1974">MANIA</A></B> - 1974), 
   the Professor's nephew. When a local warns the dancers to wear garlic 
   around their necks because a vampire is on the loose, the Professor 
   says hogwash, there is no such things as vampires (the doctor 
   attending to Brigitta agrees, saying she probably got caught in some 
   thickets, which explains the marks on her neck!). While Brigitta is 
   recuperating in her bedroom, the vampire pays her a visit, but this 
   time it is deadly.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next day, the dancers enjoy a day at the waterfall, where Luca 
   proposes marriage to dancer Francesca (Tina Gloriani; <B><A HREF="loves_of_hercules_1960.htm">THE
    LOVES OF HERCULES</A></B> - 1960) and she accepts. She can't wait to 
   tell best friend Luisa (Helene Remy; <B><A HREF="last_of_the_vikings_1961.htm">THE
    LAST OF THE VIKINGS</A></B> - 1961) another dancer in the company 
   and Giorgio's girlfriend. They go for a walk in the woods, where 
   Francesca asks Luisa to be her bridesmaid and they see Brigitta's 
   funeral procession going towards the local cemetery. We watch the 
   townspeople lowering Brigitta down her freshly dug grave in a wood 
   coffin, not noticing that Brigitta has opened her eyes (the coffin 
   has a window where Brigitta's head is). They then throw dirt in her 
   grave and bury her. Luca joins the two women on their walk in the 
   woods, just as a storm is approaching. They become lost and look for 
   shelter, coming upon a castle, which Luca calls &quot;The Castle Of 
   The Damned&quot;, telling Francesca and Luisa that no one has lived 
   in the castle for at least two hundred years, so they decide to go 
   there to get out of the rain. The only thing is, the castle is 
   occupied by Countess Alda (Maria Luisa Rolando) and her servant 
   Herman (Walter Brandi; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#BloodyPitHorror1965">BLOODY

   here. Thanks, Steven!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The Countess invites Luca and the two women to join her for tea and 
   they accept. Luisa becomes interested in the castle's furnishings and 
   goes off on her own, where the ugly vampire grabs her and bites her 
   on the neck. Luisa screams and everyone goes looking for her, the 
   Countess telling them it is very easy to get lost in this large 
   castle. Luisa suddenly appears, as if in a trance, and the trio leave 
   the castle, but not before the Countess pulls Luca aside and begs him 
   to come back after midnight because she desperately needs to talk to 
   him. We then see the vampire going to Brigitta's grave and finding 
   her coffin open. Brigitte appears with huge fangs and the vampire 
   stakes her in the heart, saying he doesn't need the competition in 
   this small village!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Luisa is in her bedroom that night, the vampire appears and 
   bites her on the neck again. At his time, we see the ugly vampire 
   turning into Herman and, as we will find out, he is so much more than 
   the Countess' servant. Luca pays the Countess a visit at midnight and 
   she tells him Herman isn't her servant; he's her master and begs him 
   to take her away from the castle. Luca agrees and they passionately 
   kiss (I guess he totally forgot about proposing to Francesca. Either 
   that or he just doesn't care!). Herman appears and the Countess tells 
   Luca it is not the time to confront Herman and tells him to leave, 
   which he does. We then find out that the Contessa is also a vampire, 
   too, and she keeps her youthful beauty by biting Herman, turning him 
   into the ugly vampire. Yes, it is a vicious circle, one that will 
   hopefully lead to both of their downfalls if anyone discovers the truth.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Giorgio comes up with a new dance idea: a vampire jazz ballet

   [and downright sexy, especially for 1960!] dance moves, with plenty

   and Francesca knows something is terribly wrong with her, but Luisa 
   tells her to mind her own business and walks out of the room, with 
   Francesca secretly following her. She follows Luisa to the castle, 
   only Luisa knows she is following her and leads Francesca to Herman 
   and the Countess' tombs in the castle's dungeon, locking her in with 
   no way to escape. When Herman rises from his tomb and tries to put 
   the bite on Francesca, the crucifix she wears around her neck saves 
   her bacon and then Luca appears and takes her away before Herman can 
   strike again. Francesca tells Luca that something is very wrong with 
   Luisa; she believes the vampire has her under his control, which Luca 
   finds hard to believe.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Herman tells the Countess that Luca must be eliminated and orders 
   her to help him kill her new would-be lover, telling her if she 
   leaves the castle with Luca, she will turn old, wither and then die. 
   Luisa gets Luca to believe that Francesca is the sick one, but when 
   Herman kidnaps Francesca and Luisa with the Countess' help, Luca and 
   Giorgio storm the castle with only one thing in mind: kill Herman and 
   free Francesca, Luisa and the Countess, not knowing that killing 
   Herman will also mean the death of the Countess. Will they succeed?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    It's easy to see why this film was released to U.S. theaters with an 
   &quot;Adults Only&quot; recommendation, because this is as close you 
   can get to softcore porn without showing any nudity. There is also 
   implied lesbianism, adultery and other adult situations on view, 
   missing from most films from this time period, nevermind an Italian 
   horror flick. I wouldn't expect anything less from director Renato 
   Polselli (<B><A HREF="truth_according_to_satan_1972.htm">THE TRUTH 
   ACCORDING TO SATAN</A></B> - 1972; <B><A HREF="house_of_love_the_police_intervene_1973-1977.htm">HOUSE
    OF LOVE...THE POLICE INTERVENE</A></B> - 1978), who always had 
   trouble with Italian censors, especially his '70s films, such as <B><A HREF="when_love_is_obscenity_1973-1980.htm">WHEN
    LOVE IS OBSCENITY</A></B> (1973), which was outright banned by the 
   Italian censors and showed up in butchered form in 1980 (The original 
   version of the film is feared lost). Walter Brandi, who would play a 
   similar role in the same year's inferior <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Playgirls&amp;Vampire60">THE
    PLAYGIRLS AND THE VAMPIRE</A></B>, is a hoot as Herman and the 
   monstrous vampire, laughing like a madman at the most inopportune 
   times, like he knows something we don't (I wish he would have let us 
   in on it!), adding an enjoyment level to the film you don't expect. 
   The atmospheric black &amp; white cinematography, by Angelo 
   Baistrocchi (<B><A HREF="heroes_without_glory_1971.htm">HEROES 
   WITHOUT GLORY</A></B> - 1971), also makes this film stand out from 
   most Gothic horror films, as it makes the most use out of the limited 
   locations, giving the area a sense of extreme danger <A HREF="vampire_and_the_ballerina_1960.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/vampire and the ballerina italy poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(including
    the beautiful cascading waterfall). If I do have one complaint, it 
   is that the finale feels rushed, but it is still surprising for what 
   it shows and how it shows it: both Herman and the Contessa 
   disintegrating on the castle's roof at sunrise, as Luca chases them 
   there with a makeshift cross he has fashioned from two candlesticks. 
   Just for spite and to show Luca the real Countess, he bites her, 
   turning her into an old hag in front of Luca's eyes, as the sun rises 
   and they both turn to dust. It is very well done and leaves the 
   viewer wanting more, as we never find out if Luisa survives (there's 
   a throwaway line at the end of the film by Luca telling Giorgio that 
   Luisa should be fine now that the vampires are dead, but we never see 
   it). This was also Ernesto Gastaldi's debut as a screenwriter (the 
   screenplay was co-written with Polselli and Giuseppe Pellegrini; 
   [Polselli's <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#MonsterOpera1961/64">MONSTER 
   OF THE OPERA</A></B> - 1961/1964]). Gastaldi would go on to author or 
   co-author the scripts to some of Italy's best giallo films, including <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#StrangeViceWardh71">THE
    STRANGE VICE OF MRS. WARDH</A></B> (1971), <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#AllColorsDark1972">ALL
    THE COLORS OF THE DARK</A></B> (1972), <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Torso1973">TORSO</A></B> 
   (1973) and many others. If you like Gothic horror films with a 
   healthy dose of sex and exploitation, you can do no better than this 
   one, if only to see what Italy could get away with that our horror 
   films would never think to try, especially in 1960. This film got 
   very little TV play in the United States due to its subject matter 
   and when it was shown on TV, it was gutted beyond recognition, making 
   it a very confusing film (at least that's how I remembered it as a 
   child of the '60s).</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Quantrini, Titti Valeri, Stefania Sabatini and Franca Licastro as the 
   ballet dancers. Most of them never appeared in another film, but they 
   were all professional dancers in real life, making their dance 
   routines seem very natural, as well as eye-opening. There's no 
   denying that Helene Remy and Tina Gloriani are very flexible, but it 
   is Ombretta Ostenda's dancing that will get your attention, because 
   she stands out from the rest of the dancers as they perform their 
   routines. You will immediately know who she is when you watch the 
   film. She comes across as some slinky vamp and you won't be able to 
   take your eyes off her (the camera loves her). <B>Not Rated</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

   him out and then our attention is turned over to TV reporter Luke 
   (Hayden Christensen; <B><A HREF="awake_2007.htm">AWAKE</A></B> - 
   2007), who awakes in his office only to find the same circumstances. 
   The city has no electrical power (except backup power), none of the 
   cars work and to be in complete darkness means certain death (There's 
   a scene where Luke is surveying the damage of the outside streets 
   when a jet plane crashes in the background. It will not only shake 
   you to the bone, it will have you rewinding the DVD to see it again). 
   Luke carrys a flashlight and sees on the Internet that there is still 
   life in Chicago (where his wife has traveled for a story) and notices 
   that Sammy's Bar down the street still seems to have electricity. 
   When he goes to check it out, he is confronted by a young black boy 
   named James (newcomer Jacob Latimore), who is carrying a shotgun and 
   looking for his mother, who worked at the bar. Luke knows that James' 
   mother is dead and builds a friendship with James and they are joined 
   by Rosemarie (Thandie Newton; <B><A HREF="chronicles_of_riddick_2004.htm">THE
    CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK</A></B> - 2004), while they try to figure out 
   what the hell is going on (Theories abound, including alien 
   abductions, illicit goverment experiments, the Rapture and other 
   scenarios, but the truth is that we are never given an explanation 
   why this is happening, only that the days are becoming much shorter 
   than they normally should be. Animals, on the other hand, don't seem 
   to be affected by this phenomenon.). When they hear Paul screaming 
   for help on the street, Luke brings along some light and saves him, 
   bringing him back to the bar. The bar is running on a generator and 
   they are quickly running out of gas, so Luke come up with the idea of 
   using a pickup truck whose headlights work (When Rosemarie asks why 
   the headlights work on this truck and none of the other vehicles, 
   Luke dryly says, &quot;It's a Chevy.&quot;). The only problem is that 
   it needs a jump to start and the only item that can do that is the 
   generator. The biggest trouble is that the truck is several blocks 
   from Sammy's bar and since Paul is too badly injured to help, it is 
   up to Luke and Rosemarie to push the truck to the bar. James stays 
   with Paul while the generator keeps trying to stay on. After some 
   close calls with the shadows (I will explain in a few sentences) and 
   losing Rosemarie, Luke gets the truck to the bar where he and James 
   get it started (the shadows have already taken Paul). James notices a 
   church and thinks that his mother will be there, making Luke crash 
   the truck into the front of the church to save James. This proves to 
   be Luke's undoing, as the truck quits running and the headlights go 
   out, leaving him wide open for the shadows to take him. James meets a 
   little girl named Briana (Taylor Groothuis), who has been living at 
   the church. As the sun sets, the two children are seen riding a 
   police horse down the clothes-and-cars strewn streets on their way to 
   Chicago (Perhaps these two are the new Adam &amp; Eve?).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   Director Brad Anderson and screenwriter Anthony Jaswinski offer the 
   viewer a frightening view of what people would do when something 
   happens that they don't understand. The shadow effects are simply top 
   notch (think of the black shadows that carry away the baddies in <B><A HREF="ghost_1990.htm">GHOST</A></B> 
   - 1990, and mutiply the scare factor by ten) and should frighten the 
   bejeesus out of horror movie fans. Some of the shadows appear as 
   people against walls, while others looks like tentacles on an octopus 
   (or elongated human arms with hands), but it doesn't matter what they 
   look like; if you don't have a light source on your body, you are 
   instantly turned into a pile of clothes as the shadows close in. This 
   is the reason why I always have a large supply of batteries and 
   flashlights in my apartment. I firmly believe that there are things 
   that come out in the night that we can never see (for those of you 
   that look at me like I'm some kind of mental defective, there are 
   things that go bump in the night, whether you believe or not). If you 
   believe that, too, you will absolutely love this movie for the 
   goosebumps it will induce. There's a headscratching scene about a 
   locked door in the bar's basement that leads to an underground tunnel 
   system (probably an escape route from the days of Prohibition) whose 
   only means of making it to the outside world is bricked-off, but 
   don't let that put you off to one of the best horror films of 2010. 
   It's like watching one of your own nightmares. Larry Fessenden (the

   (He shows up at her school and when he doesn't fall for her 
   &quot;charms&quot;, she calls him a pervert and tells him to &quot;eat
    shit&quot;), so she sends her pet bird Squeaky to peck his eyes out 
   while he's driving, forcing him to crash and die in the inferno. What 
   happens next is the ultimate fight between good and evil, as Barbara 
   is kidnapped by Dr. Walker&nbsp; (the whole kidnapping sequence 
   plays-out like some alien abduction) and artificially impregnates 
   her, little bitch Katy gets more powerful, Jerzy tries to stop her 
   and Jesus Christ himself (portrayed by Franco Nero) shows up to

   (originally titled <B><A HREF="stridulum_1978.htm">STRIDULUM</A></B>) 
   with religious imagery (including a wicked &quot;Last Supper&quot; 
   homage at a dinner ball), but the screenplay, by Luciano Comici and 
   Robert Mundi, is confusing as hell, as characters appear and 
   disappear for no reason at all and good chunks of the film seem to be 
   missing, especially the events leading up to Glenn Ford's death. 
   Paige Conner is quite good as Katy and she really begins to get under 
   your skin with her cruelty, both physical and emotional (there's a 
   standout sequence at an ice skating rink), so when Shelley Winters 
   starts slapping her silly for calling Barbara her &quot;whipping 
   boy&quot;, you'll stand up and cheer (Ms. Winters does the scene with 
   extreme conviction and the film becomes better because of it). Sam 
   Peckinpah, of all people, shows up as Dr. Sam Collins, Barbara's 
   uncle, who agrees to perform an abortion on her. There's plenty 
   inventive camerawork on display in <B><A HREF="visitor_1978c.htm">THE VISITOR</A></B> 
   (including a sequence in a hall of mirrors) and lots of bird 
   symbolism, but one has to wonder why such well known actors (and

   which seems to imply that angels, demons and Jesus Christ may 
   actually be aliens! Far out man! Also starring Jack Dorsey, Johnny

    unfinished, never released feature from Mardi Gras Productions, the 
   same company responsible for <B>THE DEAD ONE</B>. That's all the info 
   they have!), this compact little film begins with a woman traveling 
   to Louisiana looking for her missing twin sister. She hires a bossy 
   private dick, whose favorite weapon is a machine gun. Together, they 
   travel by row boat down the Louisiana bayou looking for her sister, 
   who has been turned into a zombie by a white voodoo queen. The 
   queen's muscular, grunting henchman kidnaps the girl and it's up to 
   the private dick, along with the clueless police and even more 
   idiotic friends, to save her. I dare anyone not to laugh while 
   watching this. It's filled with priceless post-synch dubbing and 
   incredible visuals. When the private dick finds his friend passed out 
   on the banks of the swamp, his friend increduously says, &quot;I'm so 
   hungry. Have you got anything to eat? I'll take anything!&quot; 
   Another scene has the private dick talking to a friend at a strip 
   joint while a pastie-wearing dancer gyrates to some unheard music 
   (remember this is an unfinished film). Still another scene has the 
   private dick teaching the girl how to shoot the machine gun. She 
   proceeds to shoot their row boat full of holes. The next shot is of 
   them boating down the swamp as if the previous scene never happened! 
   As a matter of fact, nothing much happens here until the finale, 
   where someone loses their head in a quite graphic (for its' time) <A HREF="voodoo_swamp_decapitation.htm">machete
    decapitation</A> and a bunch of people get machine-gunned to death. 
   The only real gripe I have with this film is the glee it shows in 
   killing animals. The ASPCA would have a field day here as we witness 
   the real-life killing of wild boars and other animals for our viewing 
   enjoyment. Was this really necessary? Since this is the first time 
   that this film has been released to the general public, don't go 
   looking for details of it on the Internet or in any review books. You 
   won't find any. This is a minor gem that should please those looking 
   for some new kicks, if your kicks involve double exposure editing, 
   colorful swamp scenery (some of it very well photographed), dreadful 
   acting and dubbing and, most of all, stupid people doing stupid 
   things. If anyone out there has any information on this film

    An Australian reader sent me the following information concerning 
   this film via email: <FONT COLOR="NAVY"><B>The writer, 
   cinematographer, director and producer of VOODOO SWAMP was Arthur 
   Jones. He was the inventor of Nautilus and MedX exercise equipment. 
   He plays a small cameo as one of the patrons in the bar. It was made 
   in 1960 or 1961. A little info about the movie is also in Arthur 
   Jones' biography, &quot;Younger Women, Faster Airplanes, Bigger 
   Crocodiles&quot; by John Szimanski. Have a look at the <A HREF="http://www.arthurjonesexercise.com">arthurjonesexercise</A> 
   site. Go to &quot;And God Laughs.&quot;&nbsp; Click on chapter 
   18.&nbsp; On page 5 of the chapter he mentions something about the 
   origins of the movie and why it was not released. There's another 
   mention of Bill Pearl and VOODOO SWAMP in the book, but I can't 
   remember where. The inspiration for VOODOO SWAMP was <A HREF="macumba_love_1960.htm">MACUMBA
    LOVE</A> (1960). The bodybuilder in the movie is Bill Pearl. Some 
   details of the movie are written in a chapter of his latest book, 
   &quot;Beyond the Universe.&quot; Bill was a Mr. America and 4-time 
   Mr. Universe. (His contact details are on his website: <A HREF="http://www.billpearl.com">www.billpearl.com</A>).
    Arthur's recollection about Bill and the movie are somewhat 
   different though. Arthur invented a gyroscopic camera mount for 
   filming animals from a moving jeep. Check out Arthur Jones (inventor) 
   on Wikipedia. It gives a very brief outline of some of his 
   accomplishments. There is a book called Crocodile Trader (written by 
   Rory Macaulay), which details one of his expeditions to Rhodesia 
   (Zimbabwe) in the late 50's.&nbsp; He was a big time importer of 
   animals to America for zoos. You may have heard of Arthur's TV shows: 
   CAPTURE and WILD CARGO. They were older, more hardcore versions of 
   the later Wild Kingdom. Arthur made another movie, called SAVAGE 
   (a.k.a. <A HREF="mission_to_hell_1962.htm">MISSION TO HELL</A>) in 
   1962. Arthur Jones died on the 28th of August 2007. If I can find 
   more details about VOODOO SWAMP, I'll e-mail again. Hope this helps.</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

   was surprised in a good way. Milligan was known as the auteur of 
   trash and, while this film can also fit in that category, it also is 
   much better made than most of his films and has some stinging 
   criticism of Catholicism (probably due to the way the Church treated 
   AIDS and homosexuals). Mentally retarded Donnie (Steve Burington) 
   lives in a shed of the home of Miss Martins (Naomi Sherwood), who 
   lets Donnie run odd jobs and generally treats him well. Donnie gets 
   picked on constantly by a gang of<A HREF="weirdo_the_beginning_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/weirdo vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   motorcycle toughs led by Nails (Shawn Player), who punch, stab and 
   try to drown him and generally make his life miserable. Donnie finds 
   a friend in Jenny (Jessica Straus), a girl with a leg brace who was 
   raped when she was fourteen. Donnie also has a problem with sex and 
   he is a voyeur, watching one of the gang nailing Boots (Julie 
   Winchester) and tries to put the moves on her himself when the gang 
   leave her alone in a shack, only to be threatened with a knife by 
   Boots. Jenny (who is warned by a preacher to stay away from Donnie 
   because he is &quot;different&quot; and suffers from a sexual urge 
   that cannot be treated) runs away from home and stays with Donnie in 
   his shed where they make love for the very first time. Donnie goes to 
   the house of his abusive alcoholic mother (Lynne Caryl) who tells him 
   that his father was also his uncle as his mother had an incestual 
   relationship with her brother, making Donnie the way he is. She wants 
   to sell Donnie to a man in Mississippi for $1500.00 to be used for 
   manual labor (in other words, a slave). When Donnie refuses, Ma beats 
   him with a belt and Donnie picks up a meat cleaver and cuts off her 
   head and plants a pitchfork through the neck (a Milligan staple) of 
   the Mississippi man. With his mother's head in a plastic bag, Donnie 
   goes to the church where he is abused by the preacher's wife (who 
   threatens to separate him and Jenny) and he plants a giant cross 
   through her chest. He strangles and electrocutes the preacher with a 
   string Christmas lights when he calls the cops. When Miss Martins 
   catches Donnie and Jenny together (and calls Jenny a 
   &quot;slut&quot;), Donnie finds out that Miss Martins is actually his 
   aunt and kills her by burning her with the stove and alcohol. When 
   Donnie tells Jenny everything he has done, he tells her that he is 
   running away and will come back for her. She refuses to leave 
   him&nbsp; as the entire town searches for him. Nails and his gang 
   find them first and Donnie slits Nails' throat and cuts off both his 
   hands. Realizing that he is doomed, he knocks out Jenny and faces the 
   angry mob, who beat him to death with clubs and tree branches. When 
   Jenny comes to, she sees Donnie on the ground in a pool of blood, but 
   when she comes back with a policeman, the body is gone and only 
   Donnie's bloody clothes remain. With a smile on her face, Jenny walks 
   away......While weak in the acting department (this is a Milligan 
   film), the story still packs a punch and has a lot to say about 
   society in the 80's. It really helps if you read the book <I><B><A HREF="ghastly_one_the_sex_gore_netherworld.htm">THE

   cheap rubber horror masks and rubber monster hands to kill and rape 
   his female victims (in that order!). While we never see the killer 
   stabbing and raping the corpses of his female victims (most of it 
   occurs offscreen, although there are a couple of gory kills we do 
   see), this is still an original take on the Italian subgenre that you 
   will not easily forget. The mystery is solid and the reveal of the 
   killer packs an impact. I'm willing to bet that this film will haunt 
   your memory long after it is over. Is it cheap and tawdry? Sure it 
   is, but it's unlike anything you have ever seen before. The only 
   close comparison I can make (and it's a thin one) is that it reminded 
   me of Mario Bava's <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#BloodBlackLace1964">BLOOD
    AND BLACK LACE</A></B> (1964), but without Bava's brilliant use of 
   color. Now let's get to the film itself:</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film begins with a woman disrobing and getting ready for bed 
   (it's all rather chaste, as all we see is a naked thigh). The masked 
   killer then enters her bedroom, scaring her and she trips over one of 
   her shoes, killing herself!&nbsp; The killer then takes off his 
   rubber monster hands and runs his hand up the dead woman's thigh. He 
   then climbs on top of her body and what happens next if left to our 
   imagination. We then see two young ladies, Leman (Gulgun Erdem) and 
   Oya (Sema Ozcan; <B><A HREF="as_long_as_we_live_1969.htm">AS LONG AS 
   WE LIVE</A></B> - 1969), walking down a foggy street during that 
   night, a man with a thick mustache (Erol Tas; <B><A HREF="deathless_devil_1973.htm">THE
    DEATHLESS DEVIL</A></B> - 1973; <B><A HREF="hand_that_feeds_the_dead_1974.htm">THE
    HAND THAT FEEDS THE DEAD</A></B> - 1974; who has the kind of 
   mustache made popular in '70s porn) and carrying a violin case 
   following them. They notice the man and start walking faster, Leman 
   asking Oya if she would like to spend the night at her place. Oya 
   says no, she will meet Leman in the morning and they will walk to 
   work together. Oya continues walking when Leman gets to her 
   boardinghouse. The man seems to be following Leman, as she spots him 
   and chases him away by turning on the outside lights. Leman goes to 
   her room and gets ready for bed, not seeing the masked killer 
   watching her from her bedroom window. She turns out the lights when a 
   noise catches her attention. She turns on the lights, gets out of bed 
   and is attacked by the killer (who is wearing a different mask). He 
   knocks her to the floor and climbs on top of her, when, for some 
   reason, the room begins filling with smoke (or is it fog?). The next 
   morning, Oya wakes up the landlady, telling her she is worried about 
   Leman, as she called her this morning and she didn't pick up the 
   phone. The landlady gives Oya the key to Leman's room and when she 
   opens the door, Oya discovers Leman's dead body on the floor, covered 
   in blood.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see the Police Commissioner (Huseyin Zen; <B><A HREF="spy_smasher_1968.htm">SPY
    SMASHER</A></B> - 1968) telling Detective Kemal (Ekrem Bora; <B><A HREF="raid_turkey_1977.htm">THE
    RAID</A></B> - 1977) to investigate the series of brutal murders of 
   young women in his districts, calling the killer a &quot;necrophile 
   who rapes the women when they are dead&quot; (The Commissioner tells 
   Kemal that it is apparent that the killer has no lover or that his 
   wife is cheating on him! How in the hell did he become the 
   Commissioner?). Kemal makes the immediate amazing discovery that the 
   killer murders women whose first initial matches the first letter of 
   the districts they are murdered in, telling the Commissioner that 
   this couldn't possibly be a coincidence, so it must be a clue, the 
   killer is sending them a message. (That's one huge leap in logic, but 
   is he wrong?). The Commissioner tells Kemal to find out what the 
   message is and make it quick, before the killer strikes again 
   (&quot;Is the killer a poet or does he like poetry?&quot; says the Commissioner).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The police have arrested the first victim's lover, so Kemal goes to 
   the jail to interrogate him. The lover says he couldn't have killed 
   her because he was at a poker game and when he left, he met a girl on 
   the street and they went to a hotel to have sex, all night. He tells 
   Kemal that he had a fight with his dead girlfriend earlier in the 
   evening for reasons he is too embarrassed to explain. Kemal presses 
   him and he blurts out that he has &quot;needs&quot; because he is 
   addicted to sex! Kemal than questions all the young men who knew the 
   murdered women, including Leman's boyfriend Kenan (Engin Inal; <B><A HREF="tomorrow_will_be_too_late_1967.htm">TOMORROW
    WILL BE TOO LATE</A></B> - 1967), who is also Oya's brother-in-law, 
   asking them if they like poems or want to be a poet! When Kemal meets 
   the beautiful Oya, who tells him that her dead husband was a drunk, 
   but drinking didn't kill him, he died in a drunk driving accident 
   (Hey Oya, drinking did kill him no matter how much you deny it!), 
   sparks fly between them and they soon become lovers. You know what 
   that means, don't you? That's right, the killer hopes to make Oya his 
   next victim, but he has to kill her in a district that begins with 
   the letter &quot;O&quot;.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Kemal takes Oya to a nightclub, where they watch a belly dancer cut 
   off the head of a male mannequin with a sword (!). Another young 
   woman in the audience, Ayse (Nevin Nuray), tells her boyfriend Sami 
   (Tanju Korel) that the show has made her upset, so they leave the 
   nightclub, not noticing that the mustached man with the violin case 
   is following them. Sami walks his girl home and once they get there, 
   he scares her, saying what if the monster is waiting in her house to 
   get her, just to make her scared enough to invite him in for a night 
   of nookie. They kiss at the front door, when Ayse's father comes down 
   the stairs and orders his daughter to come into the house, blowing 
   Sami's chance of getting any. Sami then tells Ayse that he has her 
   house key and will pay her a visit later and leaves, only the masked 
   killer is hiding in the shadows of her living room and he kills Ayse, 
   her father not hearing a thing. Yes, Ayse lives in a district that 
   begins with the letter &quot;A&quot; and we then see Kemal and the 
   Commissioner interrogating Sami at the station, trying to get him to 
   confess, but he has nothing to offer them.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Kemal then phones Oya for a date later that night, not knowing that 
   her creepy mother-in-law, (Guzin Ozipek), who lives with Oya and 
   Kenan (I have a Turkish neighbor and he tells me it is not uncommon 
   for the wife of a dead husband to live with her in-laws), is 
   listening on the other phone. Oya lies to her, saying she is going to 
   meet her girlfriend tonight, but creepy mom-in-law says she should be 
   mourning her dead son, not going out and having a good time with her 
   friends. Oya tells her it's been three years since he died, but mom 
   says it only seems like yesterday to her, trying to guilt Oya into 
   staying home. Even Kenan tries to scare her, telling Oya, &quot;You 
   know what happens to girls who walk alone.&quot; Oya is having none 
   of it and leaves the house alone at night to meet Kemal. The 
   mustached man follows her, making Oya very scared. She meets a 
   policeman on the street and asks for directions to Kemal's house (it 
   seems all the cops know where all the other ones live!). She arrives 
   at Kemal's house, where she meets Kemal's wheelchair-bound sister, 
   Ali (Suphi Tekniker; <B><A HREF="tarkan_and_the_silver _saddle_1970.htm">TARKAN
    AND THE SILVER SADDLE</A></B> - 1970), who tells Oya the 
   circumstances of Kemal's wife's death (Remind me never to visit 
   Turkey!) and how she believed that Ali could walk (Kemal seems to 
   believe that his sister is faking, too).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    OK, I have introduced you to all the red herrings, so it is up to 
   you to figure out if any of them are the killer. All of them have a 
   reason to kill (even the Commissioner and Kemal), so it is up to you 
   to unmask (so to speak) the killer. I'll give you one last clue as to 
   who it isn't: When Ali sees the Killer staring at her through her

    This film, directed/produced/written by Ilhan Engin (<B><A HREF="three_furious_young_men_1963.htm">THREE
    FURIOUS YOUNG MEN</A></B> - 1963; <B><A HREF="end_of_the_road_turkey_1971.htm">END
    OF THE ROAD</A></B> - 1971), is dripping in Gothic atmosphere, from 
   the fog-shrouded streets to the shadows around every corner. While 
   the story may sound far-fetched and corny, I'm here to tell you it 
   isn't, as everything I have described to you in this review is 
   integral to the plot, which makes perfect sense from beginning to 
   end, making it a very twisty and excellent mystery, as good as any 
   '60s Italian giallo I have laid my eyes on. Even though it is not 
   very bloody and lacks nudity, this film just oozes sleaze, as every 
   man and woman in it think and talk about sex as much as humanly 
   possible (at least for the '60s), so much so, that even the women 
   could be the killer (as long as you don't think about the rape 
   angle). Kemal has five suspects on his list as potential killers and 
   since this is Turkey, he has them all arrested and jailed, telling 
   the Commissioner (who could also be the killer) that if no murders 
   happen that night, one of the five suspects must be the killer. If a 
   murder does happen, they are on the wrong track and must try 
   something different. If only the law worked that way here! Let me say 
   this: When the killer is exposed, it is not much of a surprise, but 
   his motive certainly is. It came as a total surprise and I'm not one 
   that is easily surprised. So if you want to see something rare and 
   suitably sleazy, search out this film. It's a damn good murder 
   mystery with effective black and white photography and much to 
   recommend. Try it, you'll like it!</FONT></FONT><BR>

   (&quot;Misogynist&quot;), this film is so obscure, it never had a 
   home video release in many countries, including the United States. 
   Luckily, the late Bill Barounis (who passed away in 2011) of the 
   dearly departed disc label Onar Films, found the only known existing 
   print of this film and released it on DVD, but only in an extremely 
   limited pressing of 500 copies. That means that only 500 people in 
   the world own this film on legitimate DVD. I found a rather choppy 
   print on YouTube, but the sound level is recorded so low, I'd advise 
   you listen to it through headphones, or you could just turn the sound 
   off and read the (non-removable) English subtitles (It turns out the 
   sound was not encoded properly. While it sounds fine on a computer or 
   a tablet, the sound is jumbled when played on a Roku or Fire TV). No 
   matter what way you view it, you'll be glad you did, because you'll 
   be witnessing a film like no other. Besides that, you'll also 
   discover what the mustached man keeps in his violin case. Actor Ekrem 
   Bora was a Turkish national treasure. His death in 2012 (on April 
   Fool's Day, no less) brought out one of the largest funeral 
   processions in Turkish history.&nbsp; Also starring Reha Yurdakul,
