     I have to say that this one did not take me by surprise, especially 
     when I saw some recent photos of him. Still, PHANTASM [1979] is my 
     favorite horror film of all time and Angus Scrimm was a huge part of 
     it. Angus [Who used the pseudonyms &quot;Rory Guy&quot; and

     created the pseudonym &quot;Angus Scrimm&quot; to cover his tracks. 
     Many years later, he revived it to play The Tall Man in PHANTASM.] 
     was the consummate professional, who could do comedy [Watch him in 
     his cameo in JOHN DIES AT THE END - 2012. When he mentions his 
     brother, I always lose it!], as well as anything else that was asked 
     of him, was a one-of-a-kind actor. Once you saw his face, you never 
     forgot it. And he used his unusual looks to get some small and big 
     roles, usually in small genre films. Once I saw PHANTASM at a 
     theater, it changed my life. I felt something watching that film that 
     I never felt before. Every Halloween, I play that film for my viewing 
     pleasure. Back a few years ago, when kids came to my apartment 
     complex for some candy on my favorite day of the year, they would see 
     it playing on my TV and some of them didn't want to leave. I can't 
     say I blame them, because it still has the same effect on me. Mr.

     (Musician/Actor: Not only was David Bowie [The Thin White Duke, my 
     favorite period of his] a world-class musician [who sometimes looked 
     like an androgynous alien with superior intellect; Bowie came out as 
     being bisexual long before it was socially acceptable to do so] that 
     could sing any type of song [remember his duet with Bing Crosby 
     during Christmas on TV all those years ago in 1977?], he was also a 
     very good actor who was woefully underused in film. I think casting 
     directors thought of him as a musician only [the bisexual tag 
     probably hurt him, too, I'm sad to say], but watch his performances 
     in THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH - 1976 [as an alien trying to get back

     THE PRESTIGE - 2006 [where he portrayed Nikola Tesla, who invents a 
     contraption that just blew all our collective minds, who tells Robert 
     Angier {Hugh Jackman} to destroy it and never use it, but he doesn't 
     and we see the consequences in one of the best surprises since THE 
     SIXTH SENSE - 1999; read director Christopher Nolan's recollections 
     about working with Bowie <A HREF="david_bowie_entertainment_weekly_cover_january_22_2016.htm">HERE</A>]
      and you could see he had plenty of range. Bowie always had a 
     collections of musicians, including Brian Eno, Niles Rogers and 
     Robert Fripp [a very dapper man], who were always on his wavelength, 
     as he was constantly changing his style and creating some amazing 
     music [and clothing] to go along with his lyrics. His Ziggy Stardust 
     character brought him into worldwide attention, but it only lasted 18 
     months. Then came his Thin White Duke period which, in my opinion, he 
     made his best music. From 1988 to 1992, Bowie was part of a band 
     called &quot;Tin Machine&quot; with Reeves Gabrels, Tony &amp; Hunt 
     Sales [the sons of comic Soupy Sales], producing three albums which 
     were not well received. When listened to today, you can basically 
     hear the beginnings of Grunge Music before Nirvana and Pearl Jam made 
     it popular just a couple of years later. Tin Machine was just 
     slightly ahead of the curve. Bowie continued to be 
     professionally-active right up until his death, with his latest album 
     BLACKSTAR [his 25th album] released Friday, January 8, 2016 - on his 
     69th birthday. It is set to be honored at a concert at Carnegie Hall 
     on March 31, 2016 featuring the Roots, Cyndi Lauper and the Mountain 
     Goats. The multi-talented artist also has a musical, LAZARUS running

     HARD instead and the rest is history. Harry Potter fans honored the 
     late Alan Rickman on Thursday, January 14, 2016, by turning London's 
     Platform 9 3/4 shop into a touching memorial. Visitors of King's 
     Cross station used scarves, flowers, and notes to decorate the site

     potions professor. &quot;So much love for our Snape,&quot; tweeted 
     one user. &quot;Potterhead solidarity.&quot; The beloved movie and 
     theater actor's death was announced early Thursday morning, eliciting 
     near-immediate responses from J.K. Rowling and Co. The author said 
     she was &quot;shocked and devastated,&quot; noting the world had 
     &quot;lost a great talent. This is a major loss to Film and Theater 
     [Daniel Radcliffe said that Rickman turned up at all his stage plays 
     and movie sets to give him moral support after the Harry Potter films 
     ended. Radcliffe went on to say that Rickman was there to help him on 
     the first Harry Potter film because he was so young and

     made me look forward to reading his emails when I saw his name on the

     because it was like one friend talking to another. We lost touch a 
     few years ago and I never knew Dan had cancer. If I did, I would have 
     encouraged him since I am a cancer survivor. Unfortunately, the 
     disease got the better of him and the barrel-chested actor passed 
     away. I learned yesterday that he passed away and I had to stop what 
     I was doing and I cried for a couple of hours. Most of his films may

     another one of those records that starts out and it sort of hooks 
     you, and you can't stop listening and then once he's got you drawn in 
     then he starts adding things. I love the tension in that record. 
     There's something sort of unpredictable about it. You don't quite 
     know what's going to happen next and of course when the drum fills 
     come in it's absolutely mind blowing. I always liked the song and 
     then I remember seeing it on an episode of MIAMI VICE. Don Johnson 
     and his partner driving in one of their cool cars and it's night time 
     and it's Miami and they're headed some place where some bad stuff is 
     gonna go down. And here's this song playing while they're cruising

     Vigoda spent most of the 1950's &amp; 1960's doing stage work. From 
     1994 to 2009, Abe Vigoda would turn up unexpectedly in comedy bits on 
     LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN which were usually funny as hell [Conan 
     liked to make fun of Vigoda's life-long old man look]. He was also a 
     semi-regular on the DEAN MARTIN ROASTS specials during the late 
     1970's. He was also a guest panelist on a few game shows during the 
     70's, including TATTLETALES, THE HOLLYWOOD SQUARES and BREAK THE 
     BANK. He also got a &quot;Special Thanks&quot; on the 2014 
     documentary THAT GUY DICK MILLER. During the 80's, many filmmakers 
     mistakenly thought Abe Vigoda was dead and would ask casting agents 
     for an &quot;Abe Vigoda Type&quot;, not realizing that Vigoda was 
     very much alive. One reason I really loved Abe Vigoda was because he 
     lived in the same small town in New Jersey as I do and would see him 
     every once in a while in grocery or department stores. I would always 
     say hello and he would flash that famous grin and say &quot;How the 
     hell are you doin'?&quot; I would always call him &quot;Mr. 
     Vigoda&quot;, but he insisted that I call him Abe. He was a true 
     gentleman. An old-school kind of guy. Always graceful and 
     accommodating. I will miss him. Abe Vigoda died of natural causes in 
     his sleep on January 26, 2016 in Woodland Park, New Jersey. He was 94 
     years-old.) - 01/26/16</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

     Growing up with a racist father during those times was extremely 
     hard, because he forbade me from playing with the Black kids, but I 
     did so anyway [And it should come as no surprise that some towns in 
     Texas totally banned the book, even today!]. I grew up colorblind 
     when it came to skin color thanks to that book, especially during all 
     the belt whippings my father would give me for playing with the Black 
     kids. All the whippings in the world didn't stop me, thanks to the 
     words of Harper Lee and that is why I think she deserves a place on 
     every obituary list. She did more with one book before Martin Lurther 
     King came around when it came to civil rights. That Lee was a white 
     woman is simply extraordinary. She was born and raised in Alabama 
     with a lawyer father [Atticus Finch is loosely based on him], but 
     swears that the novel is not autobiographical [She was a recluse and 
     never made public appearances until much later in her life]; she said 
     that it was taken from bits and pieces of trials that she watched her 
     defense attorney father participate in [She also swore she was not 
     Scout Finch]. She grew frail during her later years and released 
     another book named GO SET A WATCHMAN in July 2015 [Which I read, but 
     refuse to read again. Read it and you will know why.], but it was 
     actually written before MOCKINGBIRD. I still read TO KILL A 
     MOCKINGBIRD often, because the words just roll off the tongue like a 
     fine aged wine. Harper Lee may have only one major accomplishment in 
     her life, but what an accomplishment it was. It still resonates 
     around the world. My ass may have been sore during most of my 
     childhood, but I wore it like a badge of honor. Harper Lee was 89 
     years-old, but her words will endure forever. And isn't it unusual

     which was turned into the wonderfully atmospheric medieval 1986 
     thriller of the same name starring Sean Connery and a very young 
     Christian Slater. Eco was also an expert on signs and symbols, 
     something that has fascinated me every since I saw my first Mummy 
     movie as a young boy and saw those hieroglyphics on the stone walls. 
     I had to know what they meant and, later<!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/umberto eco photo small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="102" HEIGHT="121" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="My friend, Umberto Eco" BORDER="0"> 
     in my life, I had a chance to meet Mr. Eco in Italy and he was an 
     immense help. But Umberto Eco was much, much more than that. He was a 
     very educated man who knew everything from religious Saints to comic 
     book heroes and villains [and the roles they played in religion], so 
     there was no subject he couldn't talk about. He was a professor of 
     semiotics, the study of communication through signs and symbols, at 
     the University of Bologna. Also a philiosopher, a historian, literary 
     critic, and an aesthetician. He is an avid book collector and owns 
     more than 30,000 volumes. The subjects of his scholarly 
     investigations range from St. Thomas Aquinas, to James Joyce, to 
     Superman. It's not very often that you get a chance to meet a person 
     like this, but I did on a trip to Italy in the early 90's. Even 
     though his English was broken [Hey, he lived in Italy! I should have 
     learned Italian!], we had lunch and I laughed so hard I cried. There 
     was no subject he didn't know about and that included movies. Just 
     sitting outside listening to him talk in the language of love [I was 
     there with my ex-wife, who just got over a major operation and this 
     was something we did to get her mind off it. Eco was aware and made 
     her feel right at home, talking about her interests, too.] made the 
     whole trip worthwhile. I think being a novelist is one of the noblest 
     of professions because it teaches the reader things they never 
     learned before. Umberto Eco was the book and I was the reader 
     listening to him. Farewell, my friend. I will never forget our long 
     lunch together in Milan. Mr. Eco also authored several more books, 
     some of them fiction, and appeared on many Italian TV talk shows as 
     himself. Oh, and I forgot one thing: He thought I was brave telling 
     him I was an Athiest in a country known for their religion. But he 
     never put me down in any way. We even talked religion for a little 
     while. Umberto Eco passed away due to complications of cancer and was 
     84 years-old. This one hurt.) - 02/19/16</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

     and was a member of many game shows. Due to his tall, enormously 
     broad frame, Kennedy was frequently cast in the 1960s and 1970s as 
     bullies and thugs, and had the distinction of brutalizing stars like 
     Cary Grant, Paul Newman and Clint Eastwood on screen while gaining a 
     reputation off-screen as one of the nicest actors around. By his 60s 
     he finally got the chance to play friendlier characters, such as his 
     lovable Capt. Ed Hocken in the NAKED GUN films. He received a star on 
     the Hollywood Walk Of Fame on October 3, 1991 at 6356 Hollywood Blvd.

     about The Beatles, The 60's English Music Invasion and Pop Music, as 
     well as appear on many British and American talk and interview shows, 
     where his sense of humor and jovial manner actually made him one of 
     the nicest guys in the music business. In 2002, he won a Lifetime 
     Achievement Award from the World Soundtrack Awards&reg;. He was also 
     inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&reg; (under the category 
     Non-Performer, which is bullshit) in 1999. George Martin was actually 
     the &quot;Fifth Beatle&quot;, as he played keyboards on many of their 
     songs [Every member of the band bought a piano and Martin bought a 
     guitar, ao they all could learn each other's instruments. Martin 
     would publicly say that the band would learn keyboards much better 
     than he learned guitar.]. Martin also managed many other singers and 
     bands, but he will be forever associated with The Beatles, even if he 
     thought the best musician overall was Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys. 
     One of the last of the music producer legends [Phil Spector could 
     have learned a thing or two from him], who thought that putting 
     orchestras into pop music would help the sound and it did. His life 
     story would make a great book and movie. George Martin died of 
     natural causes and was 90 years-old.) - 03/08/16</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

     alone was also a film composer for the likes of Dario Argento, Lucio

     usually more memorable to audiences because you don't see them every 
     day. What you do see are people trying to get by and be socially 
     acceptable and follow most rules. I mean, nobody slows down on the 
     freeway when things are going well. They slow down when there's an 
     accident, to see if they can see some blood. Nobody reports good 
     stuff on the news, they report bad stuff. The bad news is more 
     distinctive, it shocks us.&quot; </FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN">Drake was

      According to the IMDb: </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;In the early 
     1960s when TV-western mania reached its peak, an American magazine 
     sponsored a contest for the actors who portrayed western heroes and 
     villains. Since the climactic moment of so many shows was the classic quick-draw
      shoot-out, the actors had to acquire that skill to play their 
     scenes. The magazine held a competiton among some of the stars of the 
     shows, firing blanks, aiming not at each other but downrange, and 
     using an electronic timer. Quite a number of cowboy stars showed up 
     to &quot;slap leather.&quot; Peter Brown beat them all and won the 
     title of the fastest gun in Hollywood.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN"> 
     He was also married five times. I'll end Peter Brown's obituary with 
     the following quote he made about his life as an actor: &quot;Every 
     actor likes to work. But there are different qualities of work. I've 
     gone to the Philippines to make war movies in the jungles and swamps 
     with leeches and I've ridden horses playing cowboys and Indians. I've 
     lots of different kinds of work and I am grateful for all of it.&quot;

     She was in demand right up until her death, which attests to her

     was also diagnosed as having Manic-Depression [which could explain 
     her being married four times, including to actor John Astin, which 
     produced actor son Sean Astin; her marriage to Michael Tell only 
     lasted 13 days!], but everyone has their troubles and we should not

     the rainy SuperBowl 41 in 2007 and many critics believe it was the 
     best ever. Everyone knows he changed his name to a symbol and was 
     known as &quot;The Artist Formally Known As Prince&quot; because of 
     his contract with Warner Brothers was considered by him as 
     &quot;oppressive&quot;. He was finally released from that contract in 
     2000 [he ended up resigning with them a couple of years before his 
     death with a much more lucrative contract]. In November 2005, he was 
     told by his doctors that he would need a hip replacement following 
     years of energetic dancing on stage. Prince was diagnosed with 
     epilepsy as a child, and had seizures through his early childhood. 
     However, it wasn't until 2009 in an interview with PBS's Travis 
     Smiley that Prince openly talked about this, one of very few<!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prince photo2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="115" HEIGHT="121" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="Prince" BORDER="0"> 
     celebrities to go public about their experience as someone living 
     with epilepsy. He also credited epilepsy with motivating him to 
     become a performer. A a few weeks ago, his private jet had to make an 
     emergency landing in Moline Ill., when he fell ill and had to cancel 
     some concerts. He was found in his Paisley Park compound in 
     Minneapolis already dead. There will only ever be one Prince and I am 
     happy that I got to see him perform live. He may have been short in 
     stature, but he was a giant when it came to talent and advanced the 
     careers of many musicians and bands. Bruce Springsteen and the E 
     Street Band paid their respects to Prince by opening their 
     Saturday-night May 23, 2016 NYC show at the Barclays Center with a 
     cover of &quot;Purple Rain&quot;. Bruce even wore a purple scarf 
     while singing the song. Prince may be gone forever but his former 
     band, The Revolution, may soon be back on the road. The rock band, 
     which was formed in Minneapolis in 1979 by Prince and disbanded 1986, 
     announced that they plan to do a reunion tour in honor the 
     &#147;Little Red Corvette&#148; singer. Many cable news outlets 
     canceled their usual programming to look at the life of Prince, the 
     musician, the man. Now those are some of the best compliments a 
     musician can get. Many rag zines, celebrity internet sites and TV 
     shows keep on mentioning Prince's past drug abuse and imply that he 
     may have died of a drug overdose/suicide [{including that douchebag 
     Gene Simmons} which the coroner's office has already stated was 
     untrue, although he was addicted to Percocet and the National 
     Enquirer said he died of AIDS, but the final coroner's report stated 
     that he passed away from</FONT><FONT COLOR="MAROON"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN">self-administered
      fentanyl and weighed just 112 pounds.], but leave the man alone. He 
     is gone. The police in Minneapolis have grown tired of all the stupid 
     questions, so they have classified this as a &quot;criminal&quot; 
     investigation [in name only, but now they are looking at the doctor 
     who prescribed Percocet to him], so no idiotic questions could be 
     asked or answered. Prince was only 57 years-old) - 04/21/16</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

     (Boxer/actor: One of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time [56 
     Wins {37 by knockout}; 5 Losses], Ali [real name: Cassius Clay] was 
     the only sports figure to make me cry. That took place during the 
     1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, when a Parkinson's-ravaged 
     Ali lit the giant torch to officially start the games. It was a 
     moment I shall never forget and neither will millions of other 
     people. It was one of the most raw, emotional things that transcended 
     true spirit I ever saw on TV. Before Ali was cursed with Parkinsons, 
     he was known for his antics out of the boxing ring, as well as<!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/muhammed ali photo small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="117" HEIGHT="121" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="Muhammed Ali with the late Robin Williams in 2006."

     inside the ring. He would come up with clever poems and sayings 
     [earning him the nickname &quot;The Louisville Lip&quot;], once 
     saying that he was so fast an athlete that he could turn off the 
     lights in his bedroom and be in his bed asleep before the lights went 
     out. And it was close to the truth [Ali's punches produced 
     approximately 1,000 pounds of force]. I love this bit of wisdom from 
     him: </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;The man who views the world at 
     50 the same as he did at 20 has wasted 30 years of his life.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN"> 
     His back-and-forths with sharp-tongued late sportcaster Howard Cosell 
     were the stuff that legends were made of [They were actually friends 
     when the cameras weren't on]. To see him slowly be incapacitated by 
     Parkinsons was pure torture. I grew up during the prime period of his 
     life, when he would beat champions left and right [pun intended] and 
     even lose some of those fights. He also stepped out into acting for a 
     short period and, even though his credits are small, he was always 
     memorable. His credits included [TV Series unless marked with a TF

     Shows, Sport Specials and Game Shows throughout his career. He was 
     also one of the pioneers of Pay-Per-View, as many of his fights 
     during the 70's could only be viewed that way. I remember watching 
     &quot;The Rumble In The Jungle&quot; that way in a movie theater back 
     in 1974. He was also involved in the WWF Wrestling [now WWE] from the 
     mid-1980's to the 1990's and was inducted into their Hall Of Fame in 
     2014. In 2002, Ali was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of 
     Fame at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard. His star is the only one to be 
     mounted on a vertical surface, out of deference to his request that 
     his name not be walked upon. He simply was the greatest athelete in 
     the world and was the biggest Sports Royalty there ever was [even 
     beating Michael Jordan, in my opinion], who was adored by Hollywood 
     stars, politicians and regular people like myself. Muhammad Ali 
     passed away due to respiratory ailments and septic shock from 
     Parkinsons and was 74 years-old. &quot;Float like a butterfly, Sting

     Ms. Saldana from being killed and he eventually became a Deputy 
     Sheriff of Los Angeles County after telling the Press that he always

      ZOE - 2016 [Short; his last acting role]. Bud Spencer was especially 
     big [pun intended] in Germany, where he made many appearance on 
     German TV talk shows, game shows and documentaries were made about 
     him. He was also an inventer [He holds a Juris Doctor degree] who has 
     several patents registered in his name. He was also a helicopter and 
     plane pilot and owned an air transport business thanks to his role in 
     ALL THE WAYS BOYS. He won many foreign film awards during his career, 
     including a Bambi Award&reg; [shared with Terence Hill] in 1975; two 
     Jupiter Awards&reg; for &quot;Best International Actor&quot; in 1978 
     &amp; 1979; two German Bravo Otto Awards&reg; in 1978 &amp; 1979 for 
     &quot;Best Actor&quot;; a David di Donatello Award&reg; in 2010 for 
     his career in films; an Italian Online Movie Award&reg; in 2012 for 
     &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot;; and many others. In 2005 Spencer 
     entered politics, standing as regional councillor in Lazio for the 
     center-right Forza Italia party. He became a politician specifically 
     at the bequest of then-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. According to 
     Spencer: </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;In my life, I've done 
     everything. There are only three things I haven't been - a ballet 
     dancer, a jockey and a politician. Given that the first two jobs are 
     out of the question, I'll throw myself into politics.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN"> 
     Unfortunately, he lost and Berlusconi was defeated in office in 2006. 
     Bud Spencer was a man of many talents, but his acting was especially 
     piognant to me. He could be mean, gentle, funny and downright scary 
     and I, personally, will miss him. A very important actor from my 
     childhood until today. He is one of the main reasons I love Spaghetti 
     Westerns and always will. Goodbye gentle giant. The world will not be 
     the same without you. Bud Spencer died of natural causes and was 86 
     years-old. It makes sense that he was born on Halloween in 1929.) - 06/27/16</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

     (Director/Producer/Writer: Cimino only directed 8 films during his 
     life, but he held the distinction of both winning an Academy 
     Award&reg; and then accused of almost bankrupting United Artists/MGM 
     with a film made just a couple of years later. Clint Eastwood took an 
     instant liking to him after he wrote a Dirty Harry film and let him 
     direct and write one of his best films of the 70's [at least in my 
     opinion], but the fiasco of 1980 nearly ruined his career as a 
     filmmaker [which I found totally unfair since he had a distinct style 
     all his own]. Michael Cimino's credits included [all Theatrical Films

     nearly ruined Cimino's career due to cost overruns and the final 
     long-running final print {over 300 minutes, which he cut down to 219 
     minutes} he turned in {which would have meant theaters could only 
     show the film two or three times a day}. The studio cut it down to a 
     more acceptable length of 149 minutes, but the film made no sense. I 
     watched Cimino's Director's cut of the film a few years ago and found 
     it flawed, but mesmerizing. It probably would have won awards if 
     United Artists released Cimino's version.]; 250.000 MUCKEN IM

     Producer]; TO EACH HIS OWN CINEMA - 2007 [Director only]; Il PIANTO 
     DELLA STATUA - 2007 [Screenplay only; his final credit]. Mr. Cimino 
     was also a published author, writing the novel &quot;Big Jane&quot; - 
     2001, among others. He was big in France because his views on film, a 
     mixture of fatalistic beauty, mixed with stylized and realistic 
     violence, struck a chord with the French people, whose films of the 
     1930's also had those elements. In 2001, the French Minister of 
     Culture decorated him Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres and the Prix 
     Litt&eacute;raire Deauville 2001, an award that previously went to 
     Norman Mailer and Gore Vidal. There are also rumors that he 
     contributed rewrites to the films THE DOGS OF WAR - 1980 and THE POPE 
     OF GREENWICH VILLAGE - 1984, but his involvement with those films 
     remains unsubstantiated. He was also set to direct FOOTLOOSE - 1984, 
     but Producer Daniel Melnick fired him when he asked to make 
     screenplay changes. He was also hired to direct THE KING OF COMEDY - 
     1982, but his preoccupation with HEAVEN'S GATE got him fired and 
     replaced by Martin Scorsese. Michael Cimino certainly lived an 
     interesting life, with more films unmade than made because of 
     HEAVEN'S GATE fiasco and the stigma that was attached to him because 
     of it, but he endured and will always be remembered. Michael Cimino 
     died in France of undisclosed causes and was 77 years-old.) - 07/02/16</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

     appeared in many other documentaries about TV sitcoms and one about 
     directing failed sitcom pilots, which he had nore than his share of.

     Henry Winkler, the late Robin Williams and many other stars their

     can never repay, but Garry Marshall knew talent when he saw it and 
     that was enough payment for him. We have lost another legend,

      ten pages of dialogue could convey, as we hear the EKG machine go 
     flat. The look on his face always brought a tear to my eye. It was a 
     moment of pure acting, rare on a procedural show and even rarer 
     coming from Adam Schiff. Dianne Wiest [2000-2002], the late Fred 
     Dalton Thomson [2002-2007] and then Jack McCoy himself, Sam Waterston 
     [2007-2010], took over Schiff's position before the series went off 
     the air in 2010. For 20 years, this was my weekly go-to show and 
     Steven Hill was a very important part of it. Reruns of the show are 
     still part of my TV life. Before becoming an actor on TV and in film, 
     he was a Stage actor, appearing in plays alongside Marlon Brando, 
     Henry Fonda and many other famous actors and directors, including 
     Elia Kazan. During television's early years, Hill mainly did live or 
     Kinescope [filming live television on a monitor using ancient forms 
     of videotape] plays and it earned him the Sylvania Television Award 
     for dramatic actor of the year in 1954. When a rabbi convinced him to 
     adhere to Orthodox Judiasm, it basically ended his Stage career 
     because he could not appear in Friday night and Saturday matinee 
     performances. That religious ryder was a part of all his movie and TV 
     contracts which makes the creators of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE the cretins 
     here. They just didn't understand how devoted Hill was towards his 
     religion and basically made his life hell during the filming of the 
     last few episodes of the first season [They thought they could break 
     Hill of his religious convictions] and then fired him when he refused 
     to pick the show over his religion. It made Hill so mad, he took a 
     sabbatical from acting for over 10 years. If it is one thing I like, 
     even though I am an Atheist, is a man of convictions and Hill was one 
     of those rare peiple.&nbsp; Steven Hill passed away of natural causes

     and Wilder's performance. A film better for adults than children. 
     Once seen through adult eyes, you may never let your children watch 
     it again. But I am willing to bet you will; Nominated for a Golden 
     Globe&reg; for Best Actor in a Motion Picture; Wilder hated the idea

     GABBA! MOVIE 2 - 2015 [TV Movie; Voice only; his last acting 
     credit.]. Gene Wilder also loved to sing in many of his films. Who 
     can ever forget &quot;Pure Imagination&quot; from WILLY WONKA? It is 
     one of the best songs in any film in the last 50 years because it 
     tells you that having a vivid imagination is a good thing, not a bad 
     thing like most parents think. Wishes can come true and Wilder's 
     performance of that song and in the film in general deserved an 
     Academy Award&reg; [He did receive a Golden Globe&reg; nomination]. 
     He received a tribute from Coldplay on Monday night, August 29, 2016. 
     Chris Martin and his bandmates remembered the actor with a cover of 
     &#147;Pure Imagination,&#148; from Wilder&#146;s classic 1971 film 
     WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. The band performed at the 
     Pepsi Center in Denver on Monday, after news broke of Wilder&#146;s 
     death the earlier in the day in Connecticut. After his wife Gilda 
     Radner died of ovarian cancer in 1989, Gene co-founded Gilda's Club, 
     a support group to raise awareness of the disease. It is still going 
     strong today, even though he remarried a few years after her death. 
     Wilder himself In 1999 was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 
     underwent chemotherapy and also treated his cancer with an adult 
     stem-cell treatment. He made a full recovery from cancer in 2000.

     One of the best character actors of our generation, Jon Polito was a 
     favorite of the Coen Brothers and appeared in films of every type,

     gangsters or crooked cops, because he had the looks and voice to fit

     IMDb: His proudest achievement was the Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership 
     (HOBY), which he founded in 1958 after spending considerable time 
     with Dr. Albert Schweitzer and his clinic in Africa. Struck by the 
     impassioned work being done by Schweitzer, O'Brian set up his own 
     program to help develop young people into future leaders. O'Brian was 
     awarded honorary degrees by several prestigious institutions of 
     higher learning. The perennial bachelor finally &quot;settled 
     down&quot; and tied the knot at age 81 with long-time companion of 18 
     years Virginia Barber in 2008, who was close to three decades his 
     junior [She was 54; he was 83]. They lived in his Benedict Canyon 
     home. He was also a singer and Stage actor, too, but he was proudest 
     of his volunteer work with the military [he was the youngest drill 
     instructor at 17 years of age in Marine Corp. history and was one of 
     the first celebrities to frontline tours of Vietnam at the request of 
     the State Department] and created The Hugh O'Brian Acting Awards 
     Competition, which was developed in 1964 at UCLA with cash awards 
     going to acting talents. He was a good man who passed on his good 
     fortune to those who needed it the most. Hugh O'Brian passed away of

     and mailings for marketers worldwide, even being inducted into the 
     Direct Marketing Association's Hall of Fame [He wrote 32 books on the

     a hell of a lot more money than making films and for more than twenty 
     years, he taught graduate-level courses in mass communications, and 
     lectured at professional seminars worldwide. Then VHS came into

     known as John Zacherley] was born September 26, 1918 in Philadelphia, 
     PA, the youngest of four children. He went to high school in the 
     Germantown area, then enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania, 
     receiving a Bachelor's Degree. During World War II, he enlisted in 
     the U.S. Army and served as a quartermaster in North Africa and 
     Europe, and after the war he returned<A HREF="john_zacherley_1918-2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/zacherley shock theater captive wild women tv ad3 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="76" HEIGHT="120" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
     to Philadelphia, joining a local repertory theater company. In 1954, 
     he appeared as an actor at WCAU-TV in the western ACTION IN THE 
     AFTERNOON, playing several roles [including an undertaker]. It was 
     produced by the station and aired in the New York City market. Three 
     years later, he was hired as the host of WCAU's SHOCK THEATER, which 
     debuted on October 7, 1957. As the host, Zacherle appeared as the 
     character Roland [pronounced Ro-LAND], wearing a long black 
     undertaker's coat and who lived with his wife [known as &quot;My 
     Dear&quot;] and his lab assistant, Igor. It involved numerous 
     stylized horror-comedy gags that have since become a standard to 
     countless horror film hosts. In the opening sequence, Zacherle would 
     descend a long staircase to the crypt. The producers erred on the 
     side of goriness, showing fake severed heads with chocolate syrup 
     blood. The show sometimes featured live &quot;cut-ins&quot; during 
     the movie, in which the soundtrack continued to play on the air, 
     while the visual feed switched briefly to a shot of Zacherle in the 
     middle of a humorous stunt, such as riding a tombstone. The show ran 
     for 92 broadcasts until 1958. He was a close colleague of AMERICAN 
     BANDSTAND host Dick Clark, and he sometimes filled in on road touring 
     shows of &quot;Bandstand&quot; in the 1960s. Dick reportedly gave 
     Zacherle the nickname of &quot;The Cool Ghoul,&quot; and in 1958, 
     partly with the assistance of Clark, he recorded &quot;Dinner with 
     Drac&quot; for Cameo Records, backed by Dave Appell. At first, it was 
     thought that the recording was too gory to play on 
     &quot;Bandstand,&quot; and Zacherle returned to the studio to cut a 
     second, tamer version. Eventually, both versions was released 
     simultaneously as backsides of the same 45rpm record, and it broke 
     the top ten nationally. Zacherle later released several LPs mixing 
     horror sound effects with novelty songs. In 1958, CBS purchased 
     WCAU-TV, which prompted Zacherle to leave Philadelphia for WABC-TV in 
     New York. He continued in the same format as SHOCK THEATER, but the 
     studio added a &quot;y&quot; to the end of his name (to help with 
     pronunciation), and in March 1958, they changed the title to 
     ZACHERLEY AT LARGE. His Roland character became Zacherley and &quot;My
      Dear&quot; became Isobel. He also began appearing in motion 
     pictures, including &quot;Key to Murder&quot; [1958], alongside 
     several of his &quot;Action in the Afternoon&quot; colleagues. In 
     1960, Zacherley moved to WOR-TV, and in a promotional gimmick, he 
     staged a presidential campaign. His &quot;plaform&quot; recording can 
     be found on the album &quot;Spook Along with Zacherley&quot; [1960], 
     which originally included a &quot;Zacherley for President&quot; book 
     and poster set, which is highly collectible today. He's the only 
     horror host to appear on the cover of &quot;Famous Monsters of 
     Filmland&quot; twice. In 1963, he was the first host/performer of 
     WPIX-TV, Channel 11, New York City, hosting CHILLER THEATRE, THE 
     MIGHTY HERCULES CARTOON SHOW [seen weekday evenings from September to 
     November, 1963], and THE THREE STOOGES SHOW until January of 1964. He 
     then moved to WNJU-TV in Newark and hosted a teenage dance show 
     called DISC-O-TEEN, appearing in full costume and <A HREF="john_zacherley_1918-2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/zacherley photo2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="104" HEIGHT="121" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>using
      the teenage participants in his skits, attracting bands like The 
     Lovin' Spoonful, The Young Rascals and The Doors [Zacherle recalls, 
     &quot;Jim Morrison looked at our weird set and mumbled, 'This is the 
     damnedest TV show I've ever seen.'&quot;] He was a morning radio host 
     for WNEW-FM in 1967, and two years later he became the station night 
     broadcaster [10pm-2am] with a progressive rock format. The success of 
     the show led to the use of the same format in Philadelphia. As 
     &quot;Zacherley,&quot; he hosted several rock concerts in New York 
     City's Central Park in the 60's and 70's. On February 14, 1970, he 
     appeared at Fillmore East music hall in New York to introduce The 
     Grateful Dead, and his introduction of the band can be heard on their 
     album &quot;Dick's Picks - Volume 4.&quot; In 1971, he switched his 
     show to WPLJ-FM in New York, where he stayed for ten years. In the 
     early 1980's, he played a wizard on CAPTAIN KANGAROO, appearing 
     without his costume and makeup. He continued to perform in character 
     at Halloween broadcasts in the New York and Philadelphia areas 
     throughout the 80's and 90's, and once narrated Edgar Allan Poe's 
     &quot;The Raven&quot; which was backed up by the Philadelphia 
     Orchestra. In 1986, he hosted a direct-to-video program called 
     HORRIBLE HORROR&quot;, where he performed monologues between clips 
     from public domain sci-fi and horror films. In 1988, he struck up a 
     friendship with B-movie horror director Frank Henenlotter, and voiced 
     one of the lead characters in his horror comedy BRAIN DAMAGE, playing 
     Aylmar, a slug-like, drug-dealing, brain-eating parasite. He also a 
     cameo in Henelotter's FRANKENHOOKER, appropriately playing a TV 
     weatherman who specializes in forecasts for mad scientists. In late 
     1992, Zacherley joined the staff of &quot;K-Rock,&quot; WXRK-FM, at a 
     time when the roster included other free-form luminaries as Vin 
     Scelsa [with whom he'd worked at WPLJ] and Meg Griffin. However, in 
     January of 1996, the station switched to an alternative rock format 
     and hired all new disc jockeys. He was inducted into the Horror Host 
     Hall of Fame in 2011, and has lived in a one-bedroom, rent-controlled 
     apartment in Manhattan for the past 50 years.&quot; </FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN">That
      was a great biography about a milti-talented man, but I have a few 
     more things to add about the man. Zacherle did many conventions in 
     his well-known full makeup and clothing costume and was always a 
     pleasant man with that distinctive, infectious laugh who would talk 
     to you for hours<A HREF="john_zacherley_1918-2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/zacherley photo4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="117" HEIGHT="121" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
     while signing autographs and taking photos with fans. He just wasn't 
     a horror host; he loved music most of all and, even at his advanced 
     age, appreciated all types of music. One of my favorite TV memories 
     happened in 2008, when John Zacherle put on his get-up and hosted the 
     film TARANTULA [1958] on WPIX TV Channel 11's CHILLER THEATRE for one 
     last time. Years of nostalgia came rushing over me, back to when I 
     was a child and watched the original CHILLER THEATRE. I recorded it 
     and it will remain one of my most treasured DVD-Rs. Other Zacherle

     1986 episode of MIAMI VICE. He has done plenty of filmed concerts, 
     which are mesmerizing to watch because he was a fascinating musical 
     genius. Some interesting tidbits about Leonard Cohen: He was engaged 
     to Rebecca De Mornay. He spent part of the late 1990s living in a 
     Buddhist monastery in California, became a monk and was the student 
     of Zen Master, Sasaki Roshi. His Zen name was Jikan, which means 
     &quot;Silent One&quot;. His &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collection was 
     voted the most depressing album ever, the vote made by a British 
     magazine [I guess they miss the point of his music]. He was awarded 
     the O.C. [Officer of the Order of Canada] on April 19, 1991 and the 
     C.C. [Companion of the Order of Canada] on October 10, 2002 for his 
     services to music. He was 32 years old when he released his first 
     album. As you can see, he was no ordinary person by any stretch of 
     the imagination and his music reflected that. He was a living legend 
     as far as I'm concerned and now he is no longer with us. Leonard 
     Cohen died from undisclosed causes [it turns out he fell out of his 
     bed in his sleep and never woke up, dying peacefully] and was 82

     SULLIVAN SHOW in 1954], a frequent panelist on many game shows 
     [especially THE MATCH GAME - 1963-1967 {68 episodes} and the many 
     incarnations of HOLLYWOOD SQUARES] and dozens of documentaries about 
     the 60's, 70's and THE BRADY BUNCH. In 1996 she got a Star on The 
     Walk of Fame at At 7060 Hollywood Blvd. In 2007, she and the rest of 
     THE BRADY BUNCH cast &amp; crew won TV Land Awards&reg; Pop Culture 
     Award. Her husband, Dr. John Kappas [who passed away in 2002], was a 
     hypnotherapist, and he and Florence met when he helped her battle 
     depression during the mid-1980s. In a 2006 TV Guide/Bravo poll, her 
     Carol Brady character was named the TV mom that most shaped viewers 
     perceptions of a housewife with 45% of the vote. She topped both June 
     Cleaver and Shirley Partridge for the honor. Ms. Henderson was also 
     heavily involved in Stage work and claimed to have performed the role 
     of &quot;Maria&quot; in the Rodger &amp; Hammerstein musical, 
     &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, more than any other actress. Another 
     Baby Boomer idol is now no more. Florence Henderson died of 
     undisclosed circumstances at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los 
     Angeles on Thanksgiving Day [Just the Monday before her death, she 
     appeared on DANCING WITH THE STARS, cheering on her Brady daughter 
     Maureen McCormick and Florence herself was in competition on the show 
     in 2010] and was 82 years-old.) - 11/24/16</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

     syndication. In 1976, he won the Publicists Guild of America&reg; 
     Showmanship Award in Television. In 1985, he won the Television

     films. Mr. Thicke has written songs for artists such as Marc Anthony,

     also appeared as a panelist on many Game Shows, was a guest on many 
     daytime and nighttime Talk Shows and appeared in dozens of 
     Documentaries. The one thing I loved about Alan Thicke is that he 
     wasn't afraid to poke fun at himself or let other people do it. He 
     was always a good sport. Alan Thicke was also a big Hockey 
     enthusiast/player [Gordy Howe once broke his nose in a celebrity 
     hockey game. He hosted Wayne Gretzky's wedding in Edmonton, Canada 
     and in 2003 he lost five teeth and required 30 stitches after getting 
     hit in the face by a flying puck while playing hockey with actor 
     Michael Vartan.], so it should come as no surprise that he had a 
     fatal heart attack while playing Hockey with his youngest son Carter 
     in Burbank California. Alan Thicke was only 69 years-old.) - 12/13/16</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

     antics were just as entertaining as her onscreen antics. She was a 
     beautiful woman well into her 60's and knew when it was time to get 
     out of the limelight. She was married nine times [Take that Elizabeth 
     Taylor!; She and her sister Magda Gabor were both married to George 
     Sanders!], to one man for only one day [She had the marriage 
     annulled], and was the ex-step-great-grandmother of Paris Hilton 
     [Believe me, Paris Hilton had nothing on Zsa Zsa when it came to 
     public disruptions!], due to her marriage to Conrad Hilton. Besides 
     that one child [the late Francesca Hilton], Zsa Zsa and her last 
     husband, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric von Anhalt [They were married from 
     1987 until her death], in what is one of the most unusual things I 
     ever heard, adopted several men to be their sons and renamed them all 
     with German names with the word &quot;Prinz&quot; as part of their 
     new identities [there was doubt that Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric von 
     Anhalt was a real Prince due to his lineage]. All these men paid 
     millions each for the opportunity [including a brothel owner, a 
     string of health clubs owner, a strip club owner and even a 
     surgeon!]. One of her favorite lines about her divorces was, </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;You
      never really know a man until you have divorced him.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN"> 
     No one could ever say Zsa Zsa Gabor was an ordinary woman [she also 
     had a hip replacement in 2010 and had her right leg amputated in 
     2011]. All I can say to Zsa Zsa is this: Goodbye Dahlink. I hope you 
     have as much fun where you are heading as you gave us here. Zsa Zsa

     in 1996 received the Career Golden Lion&reg; from the Venice Film

     and received the Grand-Croix in 2013. Her life in movies both in 
     Hollywood and abroad is really interesting and she wrote an 
     autobiography named &quot;Avec ces yeux-l&agrave;&quot;, which is 
     also available in English. There are many funny and sad stories in 
     her life, such as when Alfred Hitchcock turned her down for the lead 
     in SUSPICION [1941} because he thought her English wasn't good 
     enough. Joan Fontaine got the role and won a Best Actress Academy 
     Award&reg; for it. Ms. Morgan the hired a linguist to help her 
     improve her English and she was then offered the lead in JOHNNY 
     BELINDA [1948], but Belinda was a mute girl and Ms. Morgan turned 
     down the role because she thought it was an insult. Jane Wyman got 
     the role and won a Best Actress Academy Award&reg; for her 
     performance. Ms. Morgan regards this choice as one of her biggest 
     professional mistakes. TRIVIA NOTE: She had a mansion built away from 
     most other Hollywood star mansions. When she married William Marshall 
     in 1942 [No not the BLACULA actor, but another actor {BLACKMAIL - 
     1947} who was verbally and physically abusive to Ms. Morgan. They 
     divorced in 1948.], he made her move out of the mansion because men 
     didn't live at women's houses. That mansion would be the site of 
     Sharon Tate's murder by Charles Mansons' followers in 1969. Michele 
     Morgan passed away of natural causes and was 96 years-old.) - 12/20/16</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

     Michael's songs will be used on both TV and Theatrical films for 
     decades to come. George also won a Grammy Award&reg; for Best Rhythm 
     &amp; Blues Vocal Performance Vocal Performance by Duo or Group for 
     &quot;I Knew You Were Waiting&quot; with Aretha Franklin. He was 
     nominated for seven more Grammy Awards&reg;. It is estimated that he 
     sold over 80 million albums both by himself and with Wham!. His 
     popularity may have waned in the United States, but he was still 
     popular all over the world. He also made many Music Videos [some of 
     which he directed] and Concert Videos, performed on many daytime and 
     nighttime Talk Shows and his music was used in many Video Games. 
     There is so much more I could write about George Michael, but I'll 
     leave that to other people. All I will say is that this was clearly 
     George's &quot;Last Christmas&quot; [another best-selling song that 
     has been recorded by over 21 artists, but there is nothing like the 
     original] and that he and his &quot;big mouth&quot; will be severely 
     missed. I find it funny that people pay tribute to a man of this 
     caliber once he passes away [a large collection of his songs are the 
     most downloaded on iTunes after his death]. He may be still alive if 
     we payed tribute to him while he was still with us [My iPod is full 
     of his solo songs and those he recorded with other musical idols like 
     Aretha Franklin, Elton John, Queen, and Lisa Stansfield]. George 
     Michael passed away due to natural causes [he died peacefully in his 
     sleep, according to the coroner's report in early March 2017] and was

     literally received that tag. Even my parents sort of went along with 
     the assumption that they were a good couple, but they probably 
     weren't a very good couple. Anyway, my father was best friends with a 
     man named Michael Todd. Mike Todd was married to Elizabeth Taylor. 
     Mike Todd died in a plane crash, and my father consoled Elizabeth 
     Taylor with his penis.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN">]. She was 
     married for a year to singer Billy Joel [Her only marriage], but she 
     continued dating him for 8 years after their divorce. She was also an 
     animal lover, especially to her French bulldog Gary, whom was her 
     constant companion who went with her everywhere [Fisher's only 
     daughter, actress Billie Lourd of TV's SCREAM QUEENS, will be now

     regaining consciousness. Carrie Fisher was just 60 years-old. NOTE: 
     Carrie Fisher was cremated and her ashes placed in an urn shaped like 
     a giant Prozac pill. It shows, even in death, Carrie Fisher had a 
     great sense of humor about everything, including her much-publicized 
     mental illness. UPDATE: Carrie Fisher&#146;s death was caused by 
     sleep apnea and other undetermined factors [like drugs, such as

     (Actress/Dancer/Singer: Holy Christ Almighty! First it was Carrie 
     Fisher and now it is her equally famous mother, Debbie Reynolds. Ms. 
     Reynolds missed her daughter so much, that a few hours before she 
     died, she told her son, Todd Fisher [Carrie's brother], &quot;&#147;I 
     miss her so much, I want to be with Carrie.&#148; and then her heart 
     just gave out due to grief, unsaid love, and the pressure put on her 
     by the papparazzi [those pieces of scum]. Then she was gone [There 
     have been rumors about her declining health over the last few 
     months]. This is one of the saddest stories of 2016, a year full of 
     sad stories, but Debbie <!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/debbie reynolds photo small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="117" HEIGHT="121" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="Debbie Reynolds and Gene Kelly in SINGING IN THE RAIN (1952)" BORDER="0">Reynolds
      was always a rock and someone you could depend on to tell you the 
     truth, yet a parent should not live to see their children die, but it 
     happens hundreds of times of day all over the world. Only, this time, 
     Debbie Reynolds took her daughter's death so hard, she lost all 
     reason to live. We hear about cases like this all the time, but to 
     die the next day? That is uncommon and extremely sad and I cried when 
     I first heard it. Not that I was a huge fan of Debbie Reynolds, but 
     the emotional aspect of the story. It was heart-wrenching and almost 
     surreal at the same time. At first I thought it was another piece of 
     Fake News on Facebook, but when I started hearing it on all the TV 
     news stations, it hit me like a ton of bricks. Both mother and 
     daughter dying of heart attacks back-to-back. Motherly love is a hard 
     thing to let go of, no matter how old your children are. 
     Unbelievable. Now let's get on to Debbie's career: Ms. Reynolds was 
     an Academy Award&reg; nominated actress for Best Actress in a Leading 
     Role in the film THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN - 1964 and won the 
     Academy's Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award&reg; in 2016. She won the 
     1948 Miss Burbank contest and was offered a screen test by Warner 
     Bros. the day after her win. She proved to be a natural in front of 
     the camera and was immediately put into films [more on her life after 
     the filmography]. Her credits included [Theatrical films unless 
     otherwise noted]: JUNE BRIDE - 1948; THE DAUGHTER OF ROSIE O'GRADY -

     personal life was quite complicated to say the least. She was married 
     three times, her first husband being singer Eddie Fisher. Their 
     marriage lasted four years [1955 - 1959], but the way it ended was 
     the real story. Elizabeth Taylor was a good friend of Debbie's and 
     her husband Mike Todd had just died in a plane crash in 1958. Eddie 
     Fisher left Debbie to console Elisabeth Taylor and their marriage 
     lasted from 1959 to 1964, where Elizabeth left Fisher to marry 
     Richard Burton [for the first of two times!]. It was a gossip 
     columnist's dream during that time and Debbie Reynolds got <!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/debbie reynolds photo3 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="121" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="Debbie Reynolds in 2012" BORDER="0">married
      two more times [both ending in divorce], although she and Elizabeth 
     Taylor eventually made up and became friends again, appearing 
     together in the TV Movie THESE OLD BROADS in 2001 [co-written by 
     daughter Carrie Fisher]. Here is what she said when asked what her 
     favorite movie was: </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;I think one of my 
     favorite films is DARK VICTORY - 1939 with Bette Davis. Why? She was 
     so wonderful in that film. And ... maybe I just want a good cry once 
     in a while without having to go through a divorce.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN"> 
     Ms. Reynolds made her Broadway debut in 1973 in the revival of 
     &quot;Irene&quot;. Although the reviews for the show itself were 
     mixed, hers were all raves and she wound up with a Tony Award&reg; 
     nomination the following year for Best Actress in a Musical. The 
     production ultimately ran some 20 months. In 1976, she appeared in a 
     one-woman, short-run [10 days - 14 performances] review named 
     &quot;Debbie!&quot; at the Minskoff Theatre. Her only other Broadway 
     appearance came when she succeeded Lauren Bacall in &quot;Woman of 
     the Year&quot; in 1983. She was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk 
     of Fame at 6654 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on 
     January 13, 1997. Ms. Reynolds was also the recipient of 17 more 
     awards and 36 other nominations. She was also a huge collector of 
     Hollywood memorabilia and opened a museum to display it all. 
     Unfortunately, it went out of business in 1997. Her collection is 
     estimated to be worth tens of millions of dollars. Useless trivia: 
     She was given a &quot;Special Thanks&quot; during the end credits of 
     THE MALIBU BEACH VAMPIRES - 1991. Debbie Reynolds died of a stroke [a 
     broken heart would be more appropriate; the story goes that she asked 
     son Todd for permission to die] and was 84 years-old.) - 12/28/16</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

     (Novelist/Screenwriter/Director/Producer: Well, 2017 is looking to 
     start out just as bad as 2016. William Peter Blatty is probably best 
     known for writing the Screenplay to THE EXORCIST - 1973, based on his 
     own novel, but he started out writing comedy films for director Blake 
     Edwards and&nbsp; had also directed two of my favorite films [look in 
     filmography section], one best known for a fantastic bar fight and 
     the other a jolting jump scare that gets to me every time. His 
     credits as a Screenwriter included [All Theatrical films unless 
     otherwise noted]: NO PLACE TO LAND - 1958 [Actor only]; THE MAN FROM 
     THE DINER'S CLUB - 1963; A SHOT IN THE DARK - 1964 [One of the

     Based on his Novel &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Killer Kane&quot; {also an 
     alternate title of the film}; one of the best bar fights in film 
     history; Golden Globe&reg; winner for Best Screenplay; Saturn 
     Award&reg; winner for Best Writing]; THE EXORCIST III - 1990 [also 
     Director; It took Blatty ten years to write his next film and direct, 
     but this film has one of the best jump scares in film history. Even 
     though you know it is coming, it will always make you jump. Forget 
     about the tacked-on exorcism scene {the Producers demanded that 
     Blatty put one in to appease audiences} and enjoy the rest of the 
     film. George C. Scott and Ed Flanders register as a detective and his 
     priest friend. Their dialogue is natural and none of it seems fake; 
     Saturn Award&reg; winner for Best Writing]; EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING - 
     2004 [Based on Blatty's ideas from THE EXORCIST; Director Paul 
     Schrader shot a film named DOMINION: PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST, but the 
     studio didn't like it and hired director Renny Harlin to reshoot the 
     film with more exploitable moments. Blatty preferred DOMINION, 
     calling it &quot;a handsome, classy, elegant piece of work&quot;.]; 
     LEGION - 2016 [also Director; The original Director's Cut of THE 
     EXORCIST III was discovered and released as LEGION, which was the 
     name of Blatty's novel which this film was based on. It is superior 
     to THE EXORCIST III in so many ways, even though I love both 
     versions.]; THE EXORCIST - 2016 [TV Series; &quot;Inspired&quot; from 
     Blatty's novel; 10 episodes; His final film credit]. According to 
     IMDb: </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;Years before he became famous 
     for writing &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, Blatty appeared on Groucho 
     Marx's quiz show, YOU BET YOUR LIFE in 1961, posing as an Arab sheik 
     with so many wives that he could not recall how many he had. Groucho 
     was completely taken in. When Blatty revealed that it was a hoax 
     after a couple of minutes, he told Groucho that he did it because 
     George Fenneman had said that Groucho was an expert at spotting 
     phonies. Groucho replied, &quot;That is incorrect, because I've had 
     Fenneman in my employ now for 14 years.&quot; Blatty won $10,000 on 
     the show, and when Groucho asked what he intended to do with the 
     money, Blatty replied that he was going to take a year off from his 
     job and write a novel. That novel was 'The Exorcist'.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN">

     during the 60's &amp; 70's. When he got out of the Navy, he decided 
     to become a stand-up comedian [he and Mort Sahl became close 
     friends]. He played clubs all over the country, and for a time toured 
     with the folk act The Kingston Trio. He was also a successful song 
     composer, creating such songs as &quot;Like Our Love&quot;, 
     &quot;Lonely River&quot; and&nbsp; &quot;Quiet Place&quot;. Mr. 
     Gautier was nominated for Broadway's 1961 Tony Award&reg; as Best 
     Supporting or Featured Actor [Musical; as &quot;Conrad Birdie&quot;] 
     for &quot;Bye, Bye Birdie&quot; [where Gautier sang the semi-hit 
     song&nbsp; &quot;Honestly Sincere&quot; on Columbia Records in 1960] 
     and was a reknown artist and author of books on how to draw. If you 
     want to really laugh, go to his biography section on IMDb and read 
     about his thoughts on comics Professor Irwin Corey and Ronnie Schell.

     1986, and it was the best part I'd been asked to do at the time, and 
     working with an amazing director, Paul Verhoeven. The writer Edward 
     Neumeier and I<!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/miguel ferrer photo small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="101" HEIGHT="121" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="Miguel Ferrer" BORDER="0"> 
     became great friends, and he gave me just so much to work with. I 
     woke up every day and when I was looking at myself in the mirror 
     shaving, I just couldn't believe my good fortune. I was the happiest 
     guy probably in the state during that time. To tell you the truth, 
     while we were doing it, I had no idea that it wouldn't be silly. I 
     had no idea if it was going to be a good movie or a bad movie, or 
     what it was going to be. I knew that it was great fun to make, but 
     while you're in the middle of these things, you just don't know how 
     it's going to turn out. It has to pass through so many hands-editing, 
     the music, the sound design, how it's marketed, and all the rest of 
     it. You just don't know. And sometimes the RoboCop suit itself looked 
     absolutely laughable. And they struggled to find angles in which it 
     didn't look silly, so to tell you the truth, at the time, many of us, 
     myself especially, had no idea if it was going to be any good. Then I 
     saw a screening of the finished product before it came out and I knew 
     it was a really wonderful, different kind of picture, with 
     sophisticated humor and yet good action and compelling characters and 
     something that was really special. I remember the first time sitting 
     in the movie theater and watching a trailer, and the audience 
     absolutely laughed at it in the worst way possible. Which was, to say 
     the least, disheartening. Then, I remember the first night the movie 
     came out and I think I drove around to every theater in Los Angeles 
     in which it was playing and kind of stood in the back and watched the 
     reaction, and that was one of the great thrills of my life.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN"> 
     Mr. Ferrer formerly played drums and sang in the Los Angeles band 
     &quot;The Jenerators&quot; with actor [LOST IN SPACE - 
     1965-1968]&nbsp; and co-founder Bill Mumy [Ferrer's musical credits 
     including playing drums on Keith Moon's 1975 album &quot;Two Sides of 
     the Moon&quot;] and was the oldest of five children of Jos&eacute; 
     Ferrer [ZOLTAN: HOUND OF DRACULA - 1977] and singer/actress Rosemary 
     Clooney. George Clooney was his cousin and they were very close. 
     Miguel Ferrer passed away of throat cancer and was just 61 years-old.

     time off from his career, teaching his craft at the Florida State 
     University in Tallahassee, Florida and was the first person to ever 
     sound mix a feature by himself due to his creating an entirely new 
     approach to re-recording sound and post-production. According to an 
     1998 interview with editor/sound editor Walter Murch at the Cinema 
     Audio Society Annual Awards, Portman was the person who inspired the 
     R2-D2 robot name for all the future Star Wars films. While working on 
     AMERICAN GRAFITTI - 1973, Murch was using Portman's shorthand and 
     said out-loud &quot;R2-D2&quot;. A sleepy George Lucas woke up and 
     asked what was said and Murch replied again. Lucas took notes that 
     were later used a few years later on the first STAR WARS film.

     William James Myers] was one of those wrestlers that you never forgot 
     after the first time you saw him. Most younger people will recognize 
     him as playing Swedish wrestler and actor Tor Johnson in Tim Burton's 
     ED WOOD - 1994, but during the 60's, 70's &amp; 80's he was a force 
     to be reckoned with. A giant bald man of very few words [he hardly 
     spoke because of a football accident when he was a child where he 
     nearly bit off his tongue; he talked with a natural lisp, so he would 
     only say a word or two when in the ring] with more hair on his back

      people have on their entire bodies. His trademarks of ripping apart 
     turnbuckles [sometimes with his teeth; this trademark came around in 
     the late 60's when a match with Chief Jay Strongbow wasn't going too 
     well, so Steele improvised] and rubbing the stuffing across his 
     opponent's face and his green tongue [the result of eating green 
     Clorettes candy before his matches] were really scary for a young 
     child and really entertaining for a young adult [and let's not forget 
     his doll he called &quot;Mine&quot; that he would bring into the ring 
     during the end of his career]. He was a wrestler for the Worldwide 
     Wrestling Federation [now the WWE] for over two decades and his 
     fights were always memorable. He was a bad man in the ring for a very 
     long time, but when he was almost ready to leave wrestling for good, 
     he turned into a good guy and the fans loved him. He was forced to 
     quit wrestling in 1989 due to suffering from Crohn's Disease, but he 
     stayed in wrestling as a Road Agent and sometimes wrestled, but not 
     often. He is in this obituary section not because of his wrestling 
     career [and the many WWE TV shows, VHS tapes and DVDs which featured 
     his matches], but because when he left wrestling, he turned into a 
     part-time actor and appeared in the following [Theatrical Films 
     unless otherwise noted]: RUTHLESS PEOPLE - 1988; MR. NANNY - 1993; ED

     [Short; His last acting role]. Steele was inducted into the 
     Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2005, was good friends with 
     Jack Nicholson and was a published author [proving that he wasn't the 
     &quot;Animal&quot; he played in the ring]. He was married to the same 
     woman, Patricia Randolph, from 1955 until the time of his death and 
     is also survived by three children. Thanks for all the memories, 
     George. Everyone knows wrestling is fake, but you were one of the 
     first to make it feel real. George &quot;The Animal&quot; Steele

     (Actor/Film Historian: My first recollection of award-winning Mr. 
     Osborne was as a film historian on Turner Classic Movies [TCM] since 
     its inception in 1994 [Before the launch of TCM, Osborne hosted films 
     on the Movie Channel from 1986-1993.], who would introduce movies 
     with a touch of humor and trivia you never knew about the film being 
     shown [He was the official historian of the Academy of Motion Picture 
     Arts and Sciences]. Then, he would interview classic stars from the 
     Golden Age of film, and he would ask them scholary questions, not the 
     same old clap-trap that other reviewers would ask. He would also act 
     as master of ceremonies on yearly cruises, where people like you and 
     I could watch these classic films on the big screen and rub elbows 
     with the stars of those films, many of them no longer with us. In 
     other words, he was a walking film encyclopedia [who authored many 
     books on cinema and<!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/robert osborne photo small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="103" HEIGHT="121" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="Robert Osborne in the mid-50's" BORDER="0"> 
     important actors of the time], who would introduce films no matter 
     what their pedigree. He would introduce 50's giant monster films just 
     the same way he would THE MALTESE FALCON or CITIZEN KANE, with a 
     whole lot of behind-the-scenes information and a touch of humor. I 
     have missed Osborne for the past few months on TCM and wondered where 
     he was. The guy who would eventually share duties with him [Ben 
     Mankiewicz]&nbsp; was now alone and now I know why. He was not 
     feeling himself. So imagine my surprise when I was doing research on 
     Robert Osborne that I found out he began his career as a bit actor, 
     appearing in very small role in films such as Alfred Hitchcock's 
     PSYCHO - 1960 and end up writing some classic documentaries. TCM was 
     a channel meant for Robert Osborne and Robert Osborne was the man 
     meant for TCM. Without either of them, the channel loses some of its 
     power, but fans of 30's, 40's &amp; 50's classic [and not-so-classic] 
     still have one outlet to see these films uncut and commercial-free. 
     And I am one of them. I will miss Mr. Osborne's face introducing 
     Herschell Gordon Lewis' BLOOD FEAST as I will him recollecting NORTH 
     BY NORTHWEST. To Robert Osborne, film was an important part of world 
     history and I couldn't agree more. People loved him and now he is 
     gone. I just hope TCM shows his pre-recorded prologues and epilogues 
     for the films they are about to show. Learning some little-known 
     information is partly what makes these films so interesting. Osborne 
     was a storyteller. I am going to miss that. His credits as an actor

     episodes of the series is like a mini-history of film and I 
     particularly enjoyed his episode on Child Stars. He also hosted THE 
     ESSENTIALS from 2006 until his death on TCM, where Osborne and a 
     famous star would watch the star's favorite films. There were 
     definitely some classics in that bunch of films [Alec Baldwin, a very 
     good friend of Osborne's and frequent celebrity guest, will take over 
     hosting duties on THE ESSENTIALS, starting May 6, 2017. Don't worry, 
     Baldwin is also a walking film encyclopedia.]. But my favorite Robert 
     Osborne moment came in 2002, when he hosted a pasted-together 
     representation of the 1927 lost film LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT. It was 
     one of the most fascinating looks at a film which no one seems to 
     have a full print of anymore [never say never], but Osborne made you 
     feel that you have seen the movie in your mind. Mr. Osborne received 
     a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1601 Vine Street in 
     Hollywood, California on February 1, 2006. In conclusion, the world 
     will be a less-informed planet without Robert Osborne in it. Robert

     impetus to start directing bolder erotic films than he was making up 
     till then and people began to notice that these weren't the usual 
     nudie cutie quickies. These were real films [made in Europe] that 
     looked expensive without spending a lot of money. Metzger co founded

      a producer sees possibly 10% of what his pictures bring in, because 
     the income has to be cut into so many small pieces. In my case I

     (Actor/Comedian: Let me start this obituary off the right way. Don 
     Rickles, &quot;Mr. Warmth&quot;, was a legend, not just in his own 
     mind, you hockey puck, but to millions of other people who enjoyed 
     his special brand of insult comedy. Without Don Rickles, there would 
     be no Andrew Dice Clay, Eddie Murphy, Louis C.K. or any other 
     comedians who used insults to get laughs. But Don never used foul 
     language, especially in early evening concerts because of the 
     children that would be present. He was a class act who was also a 
     humanitarian. Not only was he an original comic with his own special 
     brand of comedy, he was also a wonderful actor, who had his own TV 
     series and appeared in movies that people who read this site know and 
     love [And I'm not talking about all those A.I.P beach movies he was 
     in. His death in INNOCENT BLOOD - 1992 was one for the books!].

     world, as well as appearing on late night talk shows. Whenever I 
     heard he was going to be a guest, I would make sure to stay up and 
     watch it, because you never knew what he was going to say and after 
     his time was up, you needed a tissue to wipe away the tears of 
     laughter. Even in his older years, he still had it [even if he did 
     walk a little slower] and he would always make me laugh until I 
     cried. His death is a big loss to the entertainment community. You 
     knew he would pass away at any moment because he needed a kidney 
     transplant, but was considered too old for consideration, even though

     [Johnny Carson just loved him, appearing 79 times as a guest or a

     Jimmy Kimmel were good friends. Kimmel devoted his whole 13-minute 
     opening monologue that night telling hilarious Rickles stories and 
     then getting emotional. You could see Kimmel was emotionally upset 
     through the entire 13 minutes.]; he even had his own variety show, 
     THE DON RICKLES SHOW from 1968 to 1969. Like I said in the beginning 
     of this obituary, Don Rickles was a legend and had many famous 
     friends, including Frank Sinatra. His favorite thing to say about 
     Sinatra was: </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;When you enter a room, 
     you have to kiss his ring. I don't mind, but he has it in his back pocket.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN"> 
     Here's my favorite Don Rickles/Frank Sinatra story: One night 
     Rickles/Sinatra and a few other people were seated at an expensive 
     restaurant with pure white decor, including the walls. It was 
     apparent Sinatra was not in a good mood and when the waiter put a 
     bottle of ketchup on the table, Sinatra picks it up and throws it 
     against the wall, the bottle shattering and splattering ketchup all 
     over all the white decor. Rickles says, &quot;Hey Frank, can you pass 
     the ketchup?&quot; and everyone, including Sinatra, laughed their 
     asses off. That was the kind of man Don Rickles was. Those who have 
     been insulted by Rickles never took it personally because it was 
     always taken with a huge dose of humor [and they wore it as a huge 
     badge of honor]. He obtained a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 
     October 17, 2000 at 6834 Hollywood Blvd. This is a sad day for 
     comedy. Hell, it is just a sad day. Rest in Peace Mr. Rickles and 
     don't forget to give God a few good zingers. Don Rickles passed away 
     due to kidney failure with his dear wife Barbara next to him and was 
     90 years-old. I miss him already. Somebody ought to write a book 
     about Rickles' hilarious comebacks to situations he was involved in. 
     I would even pay good money for a DVD full of Rickles' talk show 
     appearances.) - 04/06/17</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

     more can be written about his astounding life, but I'll leave that

     Christian religion in 1978. That same year he married and became the 
     father of a daughter, Haven, who is now an actress in New York, and 
     son, Adam, a San Francisco-based musician. Reminiscent of the 
     perennially boyish and now balding Ron Howard in both mild-mannered 
     looks and open, easy-going temperament, his career began to subside 
     after a time due to the lack of quality acting opportunities offered, 
     the importance of turning down roles he deemed morally objectionable, 
     and ever-growing family responsibilities over the uncertainties of 
     gainful TV/movie employment. Wendell eventually taught acting for a 
     time in Hollywood. In 1988, he decided to pursue the business side of 
     television and found work in ad sales, eventually becoming the West 
     Coast Director of Sales for the Family Channel [now Freeform, but 
     back then a religious channel]. In 1997 he and his family moved back 
     to his home state of Texas in order to help launch a local 
     independent TV station in Houston. The family eventually settled 
     there. Wendell serves, and has since found great spiritual 
     fulfillment, as Director of Creative Ministries for a Houston church. 
     He oversees drama, dance and videography services for the various 
     ministries and also pastors adult singles. Yep, religion destroys 
     another acting career. Wendell Burton passed away after battling a 3

     as a commentator on many political Talk Shows. Adam West was a 
     childhood hero of mine. Even at the age of nine, I could tell that 
     BATMAN was pure camp, yet whenever he and Burt Ward would climb a 
     building on the Batrope and celebrities would open their windows and 
     say something, Batman would always have something funny to say or a 
     warning to all the good boys and girls. As Robin would say: &quot;Holy
      Cow, Adam West, we are going to miss you!&quot; He and West remained 
     good friends after BATMAN was over and remained so until West passed

     shown between double features in theaters. She also worked steadily

     voice of &quot;Granny&quot; on the Tweetie Bird and Sylvester shorts, 
     but her real fame came when she voiced Rocket J. Squirrel 
     [&quot;Rocky&quot;] and Natasha Fatale on the extremely popular ROCKY

     until a couple of years ago, voicing characters on such classics like

     WOLF animated series [1986 - 1987; 21 episodes]; Jokey Smurf on the 
     long-running animated series THE SMURFS [1981 - 1989; an amazing 172

     Rocky in the short ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE [2014]. In between, she did 
     hundreds of voices in hundreds of movies, shorts and TV Series, many 
     for Walt Disney. She also won a 1968 Grammy Award&reg; for Best 
     Recording for Children for the album HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS!;

     around the world [nearly 20] for her career in films and rightfully 
     so. Ms. Moreau was also married to director William Friedkin [THE

     romantically involved with Lee Marvin [while working together on

     Richardson [Hey, nobody's perfect!]. She was also an actress on the 
     Stage. Her Stage hits include Ivan Turgenev's &quot;A Month in the 
     Country&quot;, Jean Cocteau's &quot;La machine infernale&quot; [as 
     the Sphinx], Anna Bonacci's &quot;L'heure &eacute;blouissante&quot;,

     was one of the very few multi-talented French Queens of the silver 
     screen and she will be missed by film lovers all around the world.

     not well-known in the United States for most of his acting career 
     [which is why most of his filmography is British films, TV Series 
     &amp; Mini-Series and TV films], but he finally got worldwide 
     recognition after acting in the Harry Potter films. Here's Robert 
     Hardy's take on acting in the Harry Potter films: </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;I
      was kicked out in the end because I was just too expensive. It was 
     great fun while it lasted, the boys and girls were all absolutely 
     splendid. I had a ball fooling around with old friends like Maggie 
     Smith. Thanks to those films I get the most extraordinary amount of 
     fan mail from all over the world, even China.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN"> 
     His co-star from ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL [1978-1990], Peter 
     Davison, quite simply described Hardy as an &quot;extraordinary&quot; 
     actor who would &quot;never do the same thing twice&quot; when he was 
     acting with him. He was also awarded the CBE for services to acting.

     (Actor/Comedian: OK, I'm going to be blunt here. When I first heard 
     about the death of this comedy genius [real name: Jerome Joseph 
     Levitch], the first thing that crossed my mind was this: &quot;Maybe 
     now we will all get to see THE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED - 1972 and <!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/jerry lewis photo small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="101" HEIGHT="120" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="Jerry Lewis: The Young Years" BORDER="0">learn
      the real reason on why he was ousted as host of the Muscular 
     Dystrophy Association [MDA] Labor Day Telethon, something he was 
     devoted to for over 60 years.&quot; Now tell me you weren't thinking 
     the same thing? Jerry Lewis was first noticed as the improvisational 
     comic sidekick of the late Dean Martin in 1946. Martin was the 
     good-looking straight man who could sing like an angel and Lewis was 
     the skinny, goofy-looking comedy sidekick. They became so big a draw, 
     their next steps could only be to star in a series of films, some 
     great, some awful, until Martin &amp; Lewis split up in 1956 over 
     reasons still not verified. Both went on to popular careers by 
     themselves: Martin in Matt Helm films and a very popular TV Series 
     and Roasts and Lewis as a perfectionist director/actor of films, some 
     of them damn near hilarious, yet so close to the truth [such as THE 
     NUTTY PROFESSOR - 1963; you knew that people like the Professor's 
     alter ego &quot;Buddy Love&quot; really existed]. Many of Lewis' 
     films made without Martin were extremely popular and were money 
     makers for the studio [Usually Paramount Pictures], so they kept 
     asking for more, but Lewis' directing style was sometimes compared to 
     Stanley Kubrick's: A perfectionist and setting up scenes to make 
     himself the center of attention, even though he didn't get credit as 
     director, as those were usually credited to Frank Tashlin, Norman 
     Taurog or George Marshall. When Lewis' career began to wane, he 
     decided to take on more controversial topics, which brings us to THE 
     DAY THE CLOWN CRIED in which Lewis Directed, Wrote, Produced, and 
     Acted in. Long thought unfinished, some reliable people have said 
     that Lewis showed them the only remaining print of the film; the 
     story about a clown (Lewis) entertaining children in Auschwitz during 
     World War II. Lewis decided the film was unreleasable due to the 
     emotional pressure starring in it put on him [Jerry Lewis said there 
     was no gap between comedy and tragedy and had the only copy of the 
     film locked in a private vault where he previously vowed to keep it 
     from ever being viewed again. However, according to an edition of the 
     L.A. Times on August 6, 2015, he allowed this film, along with some 
     of his other movies, to be preserved at the Library of Congress. Upon 
     this deal, Lewis advised the Library to not screen the film until the 
     year 2025.] We all know that the French appreciated his talent more 
     than any other country [He was presented the French Legion of Honor 
     in 1984 and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977 for his 
     50 years raising money to fight muscular dystrophy.] and I am sure 
     they are mourning his death at this very moment. But we all should. 
     Sure, some of his comedy seems out of place and somewhat racist 
     [especially when he would put on those big fake buck teeth and large 
     round glasses and talked like a exaggerated Chinese man, one of his 
     favorite bits I saw him do many times on TV Talk shows], but he 
     really was a funny man. He was also excellent at drama, which he 
     proved later in his life in films like THE KING OF COMEDY - 1982 and 
     on TV Series, especially as John Munch's [Richard Belzer] Uncle 
     Andrew in a memorable episode of LAW &amp; ORDER: SVU titled 
     &quot;Uncle&quot; - 2006. Why he didn't do more dramatic roles is a 
     question we may never be able to answer, but he certainly had the 
     chops for it. Jerry Lewis' credits included [Theatrical Film unless

     kids, including myself, you were one of the funniest men alive. When

     (Director/Writer/Producer: Holy Jesus. 2017 is proving to be the 
     worst year yet for genre celebrity deaths! Everyone knows who Tobe 
     Hooper was. And everyone had an opinion of him. Personally, I loved 
     his work, while others have said he was past his prime. Hooper was 
     known world-wide as the maker of the phenomenal THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW 
     MASSACRE - 1974 (Yes, it is spelled right), a film based upon the 
     real-life killings of Ed Gein that caught everyone by surprise and

     Craven's <A HREF="last_house_on_the_left2.htm">LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT</A> 
     - 1972, and the late George Romero's <A HREF="night_of_the_living_dead_1968.htm">NIGHT
      OF THE LIVING DEAD</A> - 1968 were. Now all those classic horror 
     film directors are no longer with us, which makes me very sad. I 
     believe they all had another classic film in them before their lives 
     were cut short. There were countless &quot;homages&quot; of TCM made 
     over the years and still going on today, yet none of them can compare 
     to the original. Many people thought Hooper shot his wad with TCM, 
     because they believe he never made another film to compare to it. I 
     strongly disagree. Hooper had his own signature style when he made 
     films, which made me believe that Steven Spielberg actually directed 
     POLTERGEIST - 1982, even though Hooper is listed as the director 
     [Spielberg has gone on record saying that he directed 
     &quot;parts&quot; of the film] and it has been the subject of debates 
     ever since it was released [I was involved with one forum debate 
     where my life was threatened!]. . It contained a lot of &quot;family 
     value&quot; scenes, a Spielberg trademark and very little of Hooper's 
     signature touches. Lots has been said about this film over the years 
     and even Hooper said he directed it without Spielberg's help [He was 
     too involved in prepping E.T.-THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL], but it just 
     doesn't wash with me. With that being said, let me list Hooper's

     second favorite Hooper film, but only the full version. The 
     theatrical version was a hack job. It has become a cult item today. 
     Here's Hooper's take on the film: </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;It 
     was more like career murder. But I'm really proud of LIFEFORCE 
     because no-one will ever be brave enough to do a movie like that

     and think &quot;what the hell?&quot; But I knew that in time it'd be 
     considered cool. Quentin Tarantino told me he went to see it many

     whole point of acting was mostly getting a job and then the 
     experience of doing it. But when I did RIDE IN THE WHIRLWIND with 
     Jack Nicholson in 1965 I discovered there was more to it than that. 
     It was a key film for me because of that. Jack told me not to do 
     anything, just let the wardrobe do the acting. It was a great 
     revelation that became an acting principle. To be rather than to do. 
     You have to behave on screen as much as you do in real life. You 
     don't kill anyone in life, but you understand the anger that may 
     bring it about.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN">]; THE DANGEROUS DAYS

     celebrity parties nearly every week [He smoked a pipe and often 
     attended press conferences dressed in a smoking jacket.] I never 
     heard one person say a bad thing about Hef, except he had strict 
     rules for his Bunnies to follow. Those rules kept everyone honest. 
     Hugh Hefner was one of the first honest &quot;promoter&quot; of women 
     to use VHS in a way to show off his playmates and he produced 
     thousands of tapes about different women. Practically every woman 
     interviewed have said that they felt safe when Hef was on the set 
     because he was like a bulldog when people tried to exploit his girls 
     [Some would say he was the Exploiter-In-Chief, but I read Playboy for 
     the articles, some of which have won many awards.] Playboy [The first 
     issue of Playboy magazine, featuring Marilyn Monroe on the cover, was 
     created by Hugh Hefner on the kitchen table of his South Side Chicago 
     apartment. Financed with $600 of Hefner's money and less than $8,000 
     of raised capital, the magazine appeared on newsstands in December 
     1953 and sold more than 51,000 copies. Current estimates of Hefner's 
     net worth range from $50 million to $110 million.] was the premiere 
     magazine to make you wish you had a woman like the one in the 
     Centerfold [airbrushing be damned!] and believe it or not, it was an 
     intelligent magazine Heffner said: </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;My 
     magazine wasn't just about naked women. It was about breaking down 
     barriers, starting a cultural conversation about sexuality, and 
     standing up for social justice&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN">.]. 
     You would think important people would avoid the magazine because it 
     may hurt their career, but Hef was able to get many famous people 
     interviewed in his magazine. The articles very often trumped the 
     photos of naked women and Hef's daughter, Christie Hefner [Who took 
     over Playboy], once decried that Playboy would no longer have nude 
     women in it. It turned out to be a major failure because, unlike me, 
     many men did not read Playboy for the articles.&nbsp; They wanted 
     their nekkid women. Besides the thousands of VHS tapes and DVDs, Hugh 
     Hefner was in demand as an actor and appeared in many films and on TV

     actually had things to say about the times and and politics of the 
     decade and most of the time tried to keep pubic hair out of their 
     photos. Hef started&nbsp; a series of skin mags from other publishers 
     that could never compete with Playboy no matter how raunchy they were 
     and the truth of the matter was, Hef loved and worshipped women and 
     he loved to be around them. There was never any sexual assault 
     charges or sex crime accusations against him. He retained his 
     &quot;puritan&quot; image up until his death and advanced the careers 
     of many women who appeared in Playboy, some names of which would 
     surprise you. Hugh M. Hefner lived with the beautiful&nbsp; Barbi 
     Benton from 1969-1976 and was a longtime gay rights activist [Hefner 
     personally agreed to have Playboy publish &quot;<I>The Crooked Man</I>&quot;,
      a science fiction story by Charles Beaumont, in which a heterosexual 
     man is persecuted in a world populated by homosexuals. When critics 
     attacked him for publishing such a story, Hefner replied &quot;If it 
     is wrong to persecute heterosexuals in a homosexual society then the 
     reverse is wrong, too.&quot;] In an atmosphere where it would be easy 
     to become a complete womanizer, Heffner was one of the few men that 
     made it seem acceptable. Heffner's favorite quote was: </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;Playboy
      exploits sex the way Sports Illustrated exploits sports.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN">

     the mid-90's, leaving many of our most beloved Italian directors 
     [except for Bruno Mattei, who continued churning out cheap cannibal 
     and zombie films until his death in 2007] with nothing to do but work 
     in Italian TV or porn. Lenzi was married to screenwriter Olga Pehar 
     from 1963 until her death in 2015. Lenzi later embarked on a career 
     as a novelist, writing a series of murder mysteries set in the 1930s 
     and '40s Cinecitta, involving real-life characters of the Italian 
     film industry. Umberto Lenzi's films almost always got a U.S. 
     theatrical release, usually retitled. I spent countless hours at the 
     nearest grindhouse watching and enjoying the hell out of them. 
     Goodbye Umberto and thanks for the memories. Umberto Lenzi passed

     canceling at the last minute, although she never did it to me,&quot; 
     he wrote in an entertaining piece titled &quot;<I>The Garbo Next Door</I>&quot;
      for Vanity Fair in 2000. In another essay for Vanity Fair, &quot;The 
     Devil in Miss Davis,&quot; Frye wrote about discovering Henry 
     Farrell's 1960 book <I>What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?</I> and 
     approaching Davis to star in a film adaptation. She wound up with an 
     Oscar nomination for best actress, and he accompanied her to the 1963 
     Academy Awards. That night, not only did Davis not win, she saw her 
     bitter rival and co-star Joan Crawford &#151; who wasn't nominated 
     for Baby Jane &#151; come to the stage to accept the Oscar trophy on 
     behalf of the winner, Anne Bancroft for THE MIRACLE WORKER. [The 
     scene was immortalized in Ryan Murphy's recent FX miniseries <A HREF="feud_tv_series_2017.htm">FEUD:
      BETTE AND JOAN</A>.] In Davis' kitchen hours later, Frye wrote, the 
     temperamental actress put a knife to his chest after he &quot;made 
     the most inappropriate comment I've ever made in my life&quot; &#151; 
     about how Crawford looked &quot;like the movie star of all time.&quot;

     1950's. Baldwin moved to Italy, where he appeared in films by Robert 
     Rossellini, Dino Risi and Francesco Rosi. There he started working on 
     the other side of the camera, serving as assistant director on 
     Vittorio De Sica&#146;s WOMEN TIMES SEVEN [also personal Assistant to 
     Vittorio De Sica] and A PLACE FOR LOVERS [1968]. In 1964, he won
