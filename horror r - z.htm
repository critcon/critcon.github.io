   Heavily edited (at least here in the States) but still outrageous 
   horror-comedy from Belgium. A group of relatives gather at the

   birthdays. What a lovely bunch of people they<A HREF="rabid_grannies_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/rabid grannies vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="118" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   are: A mistrusting lesbian and her beautiful lover; a cowardly 
   husband and his wife and two bratty kids; a lecherous nephew who hits 
   on the lesbian's lover; a truly repulsive child-hating priest; a man 
   with a wife young enough to be his daughter; and, a bike-riding 
   spinster. All these people have one thing in common: They are at this 
   party to get on the good side of their aunts so they will be put in 
   the will. While the party is going on a sinister-looking hag delivers 
   a gift from a nephew who was disowned by the family for practicing 
   black magic. The gift is an ancient box and, when it is opened, 
   demons possess the two elderly aunts. They proceed to literally rip 
   apart their family. From this point on the carnage doesn't stop. It 
   is a shame that <A HREF="http://www.troma.com">Troma</A>, who 
   distributes this film in the US and other territories, decided to 
   release a severely edited cut, devoid of the gorier scenes to secure 
   an R rating. The <A HREF="rabid_grannies_us_dvd_1989.htm">DVD</A> 
   they released in America is also full screen, with the edited out 
   scenes as extras on the disc. In the United Kingdom they released the 
   fully unedited version on DVD in widescreen. This is what you are 
   missing in the R-rated version: People are ripped in half, beheaded, 
   crushed between bars of an iron gate and one unlucky man gets his ass 
   chewed off. Best scene: The two possessed aunts corner the priest and 
   hand him an automatic rifle. They give him a choice: Either shoot 
   himself where he will go to Hell for taking his own life or let the 
   aunts poke out his eyes and eat his stomach where he will die and go 
   to Heaven. He takes the easy way out. This is one of the most 
   original scenes on film in years as it induces shudders as well as 
   laughs. Bravo to first-time (and only time) director/screenwriter 
   Emmanuel Kervyn for making something other than a run-of-the-mill, 
   reading-of-the-will potboiler. The film is smothered in atmosphere 
   and looks like Kervyn studied the horror films of Italy, especially

    RAGE</A><A NAME="Rage2007"></A> (2007) -</B> Stop me if you heard 
   this before: A mad scientist kidnaps innocent people and performs 
   illicit experiments on them, only to have one of his guinea pigs 
   escape, which leads to events where a group of annoying young teens 
   are stalked and killed. Heard it before? I thought so, but the only 
   things <B>THE RAGE</B> has going in it's favor are a heavy quantity 
   of bloody gore and a smattering of nudity. Some viewers will find 
   that enough to get through the next 86 minutes, but others will be 
   asking for more, like logic and a coherent plot. Dr. Viktor 
   Vasilienko (Andrew Divoff; <B><A HREF="faust_love_of_the_damned_2000.htm">FAUST:
    LOVE OF THE DAMNED</A></B> - 2001), a mad Russian scientist, has 
   been infecting kidnapped people for several years with his Rage 
   mutagen, hoping to spread the infection throughout the free world 
   (don't ask). One of his subjects breaks free, kills Viktor and 
   escapes into the forest, where he kills a necking couple in a car. He 
   then dies and his corpse is picked clean by a flock of vultures, 
   which then become infected and attack weekend fisherman Uncle Ben 
   (Reggie Bannister, who manages to get a <B><A HREF="phantasm_1979.htm">PHANTASM</A></B> 
   reference in, even though his screen time is less than three 
   minutes). After chowing down on his visiting niece and nephew (played 
   by director Robert Kurtzman's children), Uncle Ben<A HREF="rage_2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/rage 2008 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="185" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   is then killed when he is run over by an RV occupied by a group of 
   idiotic twenty-somethings (one of them portrayed by ultra-low-budget 
   scream queen Misty Mundae, using the name &quot;Erin Brown&quot; 
   here) on their way back from an outdoor rave. The vultures attack and 
   disable the RV (in a scene that will either have you howling with 
   laughter or shaking your head in disbelief), forcing the group to 
   flee into the woods, where they are either killed by the vultures 
   (who spit an acidic liquid out of their beaks!) or infected with the 
   virus. The survivors manage to make it to Viktor's hidden laboratory, 
   only to discover that the mad Russian has returned from the dead, 
   infected with the Rage virus and anxious to continue his experiments. 
   The doctor and his two mutant sidekicks (the results of his failed 
   attempts) continue his research, but the final two ravers fight back 
   using whatever sharp instrument is handy (and there are many) to make 
   their escape. In typical modern horror film fashion, there's an 
   unnecessary sting in the final shot that leaves this film open for a 
   sequel.&nbsp; If it's blood and gore you want, look no further. All 
   others stay away. The film nearly screeches to a dead stop once we 
   meet the ravers, who are some of the worst actors this side of a H.G. 
   Lewis film, but director Robert Kurtzman (<B><A HREF="demolitionist_1995.htm">THE

   - 1997, also starring Andrew Divoff), the former K of KNB Effects, 
   tosses in so many bloody makeup effects, like decapitations, 
   eye-gouging, impalements, axes to the head and bites out of flesh, 
   that you can almost forgive the terrible thespians. Almost. The final 
   thirty minutes, where a deformed Divoff (who is his usual 
   professional, off-kilter self) reappears and explains his motivations 
   for his hatred of western culture (It seems he found the cure for 
   cancer, only to have his research stolen by U.S. interests and he was 
   then placed in an insane asylum, where he was given electroshock 
   treatments), becomes total inept insanity, especially his dwarf 
   transvestite hunchback assistant (!), who carries around a stuffed 
   monkey and screams &quot;Kiss the monkey!&quot; to the restrained 
   ravers as he/she/it shoves the stuffed animal in their faces. While 
   Kurtzman and his newly-formed Precinct 13 Entertainment effects crew 
   manage to supply as many practical effects as possible (lots of 
   squishy bladder effects and dismembered body parts), there are also 
   some glaringly-bad CGI shots on view, especially whenever the 
   vultures are in flight, which don't for a second look like anything 
   but cheap computer animation. Some of the blood effects are also 
   enhanced by CGI and they are just as noticeable as the damned 
   vultures. <B>THE RAGE</B> delivers on the grue, but fails on nearly 
   every other level. That can either be read as a ringing endorsement 
   or a dire warning. I'll leave that decision up to you. And what's up 
   with all these new horror films having headache-inducing thrash metal 
   soundtracks? This one contains songs from Mushroomhead and The 
   Fakers. Gary Jones, the director of such genre films as <B><A HREF="mosquito_1995.htm">MOSQUITO</A></B>

    the year 225 A.B. (After The Bomb) there are two types of people who 
   live on Earth: Those who live above the ground and those who live 
   beneath it. A ragtag group of above-ground scavengers are searching 
   for food and shelter when they chance upon an abandoned town. It 
   seems to be an Eden to them because the town has a healthy supply of 
   food, liquor and even a water purification machine. Eden soon turns 
   into Hell however, as this town is populated by thousand of 
   man-hungry rats who begin to attack and devour the new visitors. 
   After three of the group are killed (one girl is<A HREF="rats_night_of_terror_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/rats vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="193" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>

   rest barricade themselves in a building, as the rats have chewed 
   through their vehicles' tires and contaminated their food and water 
   supplies. The rats manage to pick off the group one-by-one until only 
   four are left. The quartet discover a recording device in which a 
   scientist details the evolution of these rats. Prolonged exposure to 
   radiation have evolved the rats into a new intelligent species. After 
   spending years underground, the rats have returned to the surface to 
   claim what is rightfully theirs. The rats begin an all-out assault 
   and two more of the group are killed. When all seems lost, the 
   remaining two are saved by the underground people who come to the 
   surface wearing yellow radiation suits and gas masks. The duo thank 
   them for saving their lives as one of them removes his gas mask, 
   revealing the face of .......a rat! Guaranteed not to be endorsed by 
   the Humane Society, this film has live rats being burned, impaled, 
   stepped-on and generally mistreated. Call me twisted, but I found 
   this more disturbing than the frequent shots of the rodents chewing 
   through human bodies. This Italian production, directed by Bruno

   film with religious undertones. The film opens with the following 
   statement superimposed over a shot of a serene lake: <B><I>&quot;From 
   out of the darkness the hand of the Redeemer shall appear to punish 
   those who have lived in sin...&quot;</I></B>&nbsp; Then, a boy rises

   Meanwhile, the boy has hopped on a school bus and goes to church, 
   where he puts on an altar boy uniform and joins the other children 
   while they listen to a preacher deliver a fire and brimstone sermon. 
   We are then introduced to short glimpses into the lives of six 
   people, each of them sinners in their own way (vain movie star,

   they all have in common? They are all going to their <A HREF="redeemer_son_of_satan_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/redeemer son of satan vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="136" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>high
    school reunion this weekend...at the Stuart Morse Academy. They all 
   gather at the academy only to find that they were the only ones 
   invited. They are greeted at the door by the imposter caretaker who 
   leads them to a banquet hall. He then locks all the doors (all the 
   windows have bars on them). Let the killing begin. After stuffing 
   their faces and trying to one-up each other, the six characters 
   realize they are trapped when they find the maggot-infested corpse of 
   the caretaker and the killer taunts them outside while dressed as the 
   Grim Reaper. The first guy is killed when a clown marionette carrying 
   a blowtorch burns him to death. One girl finds a way out of the 
   house, only to be shotgunned by the killer, dressed as a hunter. Even 
   though the final four decide to stick together, the killer manages to 
   do them in. One gets a sword dropped on his brainpan, another is 
   drowned in a bathroom sink full of hot water and another is shot 
   point-blank in the head (but not before seroiusly wounding the 
   killer, who is now dressed as a lawyer). The final woman is killed by 
   another clown marionette carrying a sword and then it immediately 
   cuts to the preacher finishing his sermon. When the boy leaves the 
   church (he touches the priest, telling him that &quot;everything will 
   be alright now&quot;), be prepared for two &quot;What The 
   Fuck?!?&quot; moments when the preacher removes his shirt.&nbsp; The 
   best way to describe this film, directed by Constantine S. Gochis 
   (his only directorial effort), is strangely twisted. Though we never 
   know the motivation of the killer (Was he sent by God or did the six 
   people do something to him when they were in high school?), the 
   entire film is one big puzzle that must be watched very closely (it 
   demands repeat viewings) if you are to receive the proper clues. When 
   the killer, disguised as a magician says, &quot;Guilt...is a 
   hard-edged thing&quot;, just before dropping a sword on the movie 
   star's head (the film's bloodiest effect), it will send a chill down 
   your spine. While basically a riff on organized Catholicism (each 
   person killed represents one of the Seven Deadly Sins), once you 
   realize who the killer actually is, you'll see that screenwriter 
   William Vernick may not be the biggest fan of religion in general. 
   Without giving away too much, there's a scene in the beginning of the 
   film where an altar boy is telling a dirty joke to the other boys 
   while they're getting changed into their uniforms. When the boy from 
   the lake doesn't laugh, the joke-teller threatens him with a knife. 
   At the end of the film, we see the joke-teller dead with his throat 
   slit, hidden in the back of the station wagon of a bible salesman. 
   The entire film has an eerie vibe to it that cannot be described 
   properly (the music helps immensely). It must be viewed to be fully 
   appreciated. This film, along with <B><A HREF="#Savage Weekend">SAVAGE

    Richard Garlini (Gaetano &quot;Ronald&quot; Russo; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#KillerReserved9Seat">THE
    KILLER RESERVED NINE SEATS</A></B> - 1974) is walking through the 
   woods and comes across an abandoned castle. He then hears violin 
   music and sees an old woman in a red dress wearing a big hat with a 
   black veil draped across her face playing a haunting tune on the 
   violin. He compliments the woman's violin playing and tells her he 
   thought the castle was abandoned a long time ago. She tells him he is 
   correct, not bothering to explain why she is in the middle of nowhere 
   playing the violin. Richard tells the woman his name and she replies, 
   &quot;Yes, I know.&quot; He tells the woman that the castle and the 
   land surrounding it once belonged to his family, but for some unknown 
   reason they stopped taking care of it. He just inherited the castle 
   and property, so he decided to come here and check it out; he's 
   thinking of turning it into a hotel or boarding school. The old woman 
   congratulates him and tells him to take a look inside the castle and 
   check out what state it's in and then she continues playing the 
   violin and walks away. Richard enters the castle and finds it in a 
   disheveled state, but there's a valuable sword hanging on a wall, its 
   handle encrusted with what looks like rubies. He touches it and cuts 
   his finger. He then sees a beautiful naked blonde woman walking 
   upstairs and goes to investigate. He follows the woman down to the 
   castle's catacombs that lead him further down, walking through an 
   iron gate into a strange room. He finds the naked woman standing in 
   the middle of the room, her back to him. She is holding the sword 
   Richard saw hanging on the wall and when she turns around, she slices 
   off Richard's head with it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Fifty Years Earlier (Sometime in the 1930's): We see Richard's 
   father, Robert Garlini (Gerardo Amato; <B><A HREF="caligula_1979.htm">CALIGULA</A></B> 
   - 1979) at the castle, listening to his dog Morgan bark incessantly, 
   so he goes outside to investigate. He finds a pretty young woman, 
   Ramona Curtis (Lara Wendel; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#YoullDieMidnight86">YOU'LL
    DIE AT MIDNIGHT</A></B> - 1986), up a tree, telling Robert that his 
   dog chased her there. Robert tells the strange unknown woman to jump 
   down from the tree and he will catch her, not to worry about Morgan 
   because his bark is worse than his bite (There's a fake-ass-looking 
   spider slowly crawling towards Ramona as she is sitting in the tree 
   that neither of them see). Ramona won't jump until Robert closes his 
   eyes like any &quot;gentleman&quot; would and he does just that, but 
   when Ramona jumps, they both are knocked to the ground and laugh, 
   introducing themselves to each other. It seems Ramona was on the 
   castle grounds to paint a nature scene, showing Robert her easel and 
   half-painted art. It's obvious that a romance is developing, as 
   Robert invites her to come inside the castle so his housekeeper, 
   Priscilla (Malisa Longo; <B><A HREF="super_stooges_vs_the_wonder_women_1975.htm">SUPER
    STOOGES VS. THE WONDER WOMEN</A></B> - 1974), can mend her ripped 
   skirt. Pricilla mends the skirt and hands it to a half-naked Ramona, 
   asking her if she intends to stay at the castle, saying they only use 
   a small portion of the castle and if she stays, she will be put in 
   one of the many castle rooms that she and Robert haven't seen yet. 
   Ramona tells her no and a sly smile comes across Priscilla's face. 
   It's also obvious that Priscilla has the hots for Robert, but does he 
   feel the same way about her?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Apparently not, for a short time later we see Robert and Ramona 
   getting married at a church in a small ceremony; just them, a priest 
   and a witness. They drive back to the castle, where Robert tells his 
   new wife that the castle is hers and they begin to kiss passionately, 
   while Priscilla watches them, a look on her face telling us she 
   wished Robert married her instead. Priscilla tells Robert that she 
   received five mysterious phone calls tonight, the voice on the other 
   end saying that Robert has an urgent appointment he needs to keep 
   tonight. Robert seems to understand (He says, &quot;Damn them!&quot;),
    telling Ramona that he has to leave, but he will only be gone for a 
   couple of hours. What could be so important that Robert has to leave 
   his new bride on their wedding night? When Ramona asks Robert what it 
   is all about, he deflects her question and leaves, telling Ramona 
   that Pricilla will take care of all of her needs (But not the 
   &quot;need&quot; she needs from Robert, if you know what I mean). 
   Priscilla shows Ramona to her and Robert's new bedroom, where Ramona 
   says she will have to do some major redecorating because the room is 
   much too dour and sad (as well as bright red!). This will be the 
   least of Ramona's problems.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Robert talking to some people we cannot see, telling 
   them, &quot;What you are asking for is absurd. What more could you 
   want from me? I've given you everything within my power, houses, 
   land, money. You can't ask me for anything more!&quot; We then see 
   Robert is talking to a group of people wearing red hooded monk's 
   robes and they grab Robert as he goes to leave. The leader of the Red 
   Monks tells Robert, &quot;You cannot rebel against that which is 
   written. The task is yours and you must fulfill it. We require the 
   blood of a virgin. Your wife. You will offer us your wife, at 
   midnight of the fourth day!&quot; The monks point their swords at 
   Robert and make him leave, but it is clear by the look on his face 
   that Robert doesn't want to harm Ramona in any way. But does he have 
   a choice? I know this is the 1930's, when a woman saved her virginity 
   until marriage, but how will both Robert and Ramona be able to deal 
   with this situation, Ramona not knowing why Robert doesn't want to 
   make love to her and Robert getting a major case of blueballs?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Robert hires a personal French maid named Lucille (Mary Maxwell) for 
   Ramona, who seems friendly and accommodating. When Ramona explores 
   the castle by herself, she finds a room in the attic containing a 
   portrait of a woman she can't make out because it is covered in a 
   layer of dirt. She also finds a dress in an attic chest, but when she 
   puts it on, Robert gets angry, telling her to take it off and put it 
   back where she found it, not explaining why. It's easy to see that 
   Ramona is sexually frustrated because Robert won't even touch her. 
   Lucille tells Ramona she has discovered a secret and takes her to the 
   castle's basement (the same route Richard took before losing his 
   head). They come to a locked iron gate and Lucille says to Ramona, 
   &quot;Who knows what mysteries your husband is hiding behind it? 
   Wouldn't you be happy to learn them?&quot; Later on at dinner, Robert 
   tells Ramona that the castle doesn't have any secret passages or 
   ghost or spirits and it has always been that way, at least as far as 
   he's concerned (As we know from numerous Italian Gothic horror films, 
   all castles have secret passageways). Ramona then has a nightmare (?) 
   about what's behind that locked iron gate. It's a room full of lit 
   candles, where a skeleton with glowing eyes holds the sword with the 
   ruby encrusted handle. Its glowing eyes scare Ramona and she is then 
   surrounded by the Red Monks, who slowly approach her from all sides, 
   holding their swords to their chests. Ramona faints and falls to the 
   ground and Priscilla wakes her up, telling Ramona that she had passed 
   out on her bed for no reason. Robert tries to calm her down, but 
   Ramona screams out, &quot;They want to kill me!&quot;, Robert telling 
   her she hasn't left the room and she only had a bad nightmare.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Ramona tells Lucille about her nightmare where she imagined walking 
   in the catacombs last night. Lucille tells her she didn't imagine it, 
   she saw her walking in the catacombs last night, but that &quot;old 
   witch&quot; Priscilla told her to mind her own business and to go 
   back to her room. Ramona confronts Priscilla, but she says she has no 
   idea what Lucille is talking about. Later that day, Lucille sees a 
   Red Monk skulking around on the castle grounds and goes outside to 
   investigate. As she walks deeper into the woods, she becomes 
   terrified that someone or something is chasing her, so she runs 
   toward the castle, only to get her head cut off by someone wielding a 
   scythe. Ramona walks to the woods with her easel to do some painting 
   and as she is sitting on the ground, the same fake-ass-looking spider 
   crawls towards her. When Ramona looks down, the spider seemingly 
   morphs into a nattily dressed man in a pinstripe suite and fedora hat 
   (Chuck Valenti; <B><A HREF="bronx_executioner_1989.htm">THE BRONX EXECUTIONER</A></B> 
   - 1989; using the pseudonym &quot;Richard Brown&quot;) and he tells 
   Ramona that he likes her painting. The man with no name (who looks 
   like a '30s pimp!) then rapes Ramona (!), but she is so sexually 
   frustrated she doesn't put up much of a fight. She also doesn't tell 
   Robert about what happened, instead they have a picnic (!), but when 
   Ramona opens up the picnic basket, Lucille's decapitated head comes 
   rolling out!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That night, Robert gets a phone call, telling him that tomorrow at 
   midnight is the time he is to deliver Ramona to them. We also find 
   out that Robert is having an affair with Priscilla (apparently, long 
   before he got married to Ramona and solving his bad case of 
   blueballs!), but Ramona spies on them having passionate naked love 
   and then gives herself freely to the nameless stranger. Priscilla 
   sees them driving away and tells Robert about it. Another stranger on 
   the street hands Priscilla a package and tells her to give it to 
   Robert. When he opens it, Robert discovers a note that reads, 
   &quot;The time is up at midnight&quot;, along with a sand-filled hourglass.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The nameless stranger takes Ramona to the house of an historian 
   (stuntman/actor Claudio Pacifico; <B><A HREF="action.htm#DayOfTheCobra1980">DAY
    OF THE COBRA</A></B> - 1980), who tells Ramona the history of the 
   castle (cue the flashback): <FONT COLOR="MAROON">&quot;In 1418, the 
   castle was owned by Grand Duke Lodorisio</FONT> (portrayed by Pacifico)<FONT COLOR="MAROON">,
    a member of the Order of the Templars. He founded the Confraternity 
   of the Red Monks, so-called because of the scarlet robes they wore on 
   top of their armor. They were a sect generally believed to be 
   heretical and suspected of collusion with the forces of the occult. 
   The Grand Duke was a mighty warrior, but his eyes could be tempted by 
   targets other than enemy lances. One day, he saw a young gypsy girl</FONT><I><FONT COLOR="MAROON"> </FONT></I>(portrayed
    by a naked Lara Wendel!)<FONT COLOR="MAROON"> on his lands, an 
   inviting prey.&quot;</FONT> The Grand Duke watches the naked gypsy 
   woman swimming in his lake, but when she sees him, she runs away. The 
   grand Duke catches her and then rapes her (Oh those Italians and 
   their raping ways!). He falls in love with her and she with him and 
   they get married, where he introduces her to the cult of Red Monks. 
   The authorities want to do away with this cult, so they send a secret 
   assassin to kill the Grand Duke. The assassin and the Grand Duke get 
   into a swordfight to the death inside the castle, but just when it 
   looks like the assassin is about to lose, he scratches the Grand 
   Duke's hand with a poison ring and he falls down dead. The assassin 
   was an ancestor of Robert and he and his family have owned the castle 
   since 1418. Legend has it that the Grand Duke's wife vowed to avenge 
   him and to perpetuate the cult of the Red Monks by celebrating it 
   with an offering of human blood, whenever there came about the 
   entrance of Uranus into the second sextile in Saturn (Hey, I don't 
   make this stuff up! I believe the dubbers were having some fun 
   here.). Ramona asks the historian when the next entrance takes place 
   and he replies midnight tonight.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Okay, I have given you all you need to know about why Ramona is in 
   such peril, but what I didn't tell you is that Robert hired a private 
   investigator to look into Ramona's background, since he knows nothing 
   about her past. What he discovers about Ramona changes everything, 
   but is it for the better or worse? As the sand in the hourglass is 
   about to run out, we discover who really is the bad guy/gal here and 
   it's not who you think. The ending of the film also doesn't mesh with 
   the beginning of the film. If Robert was the last person in the 
   Garlini family line, how does one explain Richard?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    FINAL EXECUTIONER</A></B> - 1983 and <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#UrbanWarriors">URBAN
    WARRIORS</A></B> - 1987), this movie is highly derivative of all 
   those &quot;virgins needed for a human sacrifice&quot; supernatural 
   horror films of the '60s &amp; '70s. The Red Monks are not even 
   integral to the plot, as we only catch fleeting glimpses of them and 
   they are interchangeable with any other satanic cult, be it witches, 
   devil worshippers, hippie cults, or the like. They are of no 
   importance here and fail to make an impression. As I mentioned 
   before, the ending doesn't mesh with the beginning of the film, 
   making the beginning minutes seem tacked-on to flesh-out the film to 
   feature length. If it weren't for the frequent nudity by the 
   beautiful Lara Wendel and Malisa Longo (Wendel was quite frumpy in <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Ghosthouse 1987">GHOSTHOUSE</A></B> 
   [1987], which she made immediately before starring in this), I would 
   have given up on the film long before it ended (But I would have 
   still watched it all the way through because I always watch the 
   entirety of a film once I begin them. It's both a gift and a curse, 
   something I do for you, my faithful readers.). This film lacks 
   tension, as well as scares, and the special effects are anything but 
   special, as the severed heads on view look like mannequin heads 
   outfitted in wigs and makeup and most of the gore is off-camera, 
   including Lucille's decapitation. Did I mention the fake-ass-looking 
   spider? I did? Good! This film has nothing to offer horror film 
   aficionados, yet it is not a badly made film. It's just too common 
   for its own good, but if you want to see Ms. Wendel naked, full monty 
   nude, then go for it. All others are urged to stay away.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   in the minority in that opinion), returns with this modern-day horror 
   film, set in the beginning of President George W. Bush's &quot;War On 
   Terror&quot; in the Middle East. I'm glad to report that I enjoyed 
   this film immensely. The film opens with Army Specialist Jeff Keller 
   (Shane West; <B><A HREF="dracula_2000_1999.htm">DRACULA 2000</A></B> 
   - 1999) being grilled by his superiors on why he is the only survivor 
   on a mission he and a small platoon of soldiers were assigned to. The 
   film then flashes-back two weeks earlier to show us what happened. 
   Lt. Colonel Arson (J.K. Simmons; <B><A HREF="closer_tv_series.htm">THE
    CLOSER</A></B> - 2005-2012, in what amounts to a small cameo) 
   assigns Staff Sgt. Marcus Howston (Leonard Roberts) and his men to 
   patrol a stretch of road known to be used by Al-Qaeda (Arson asks 
   Howston, &quot;Do you like unicorns?&quot; and a puzzled Howston 
   answers, &quot;Yes&quot;. Arson then replies, &quot;What are you, 
   some kind of faggot?&quot; and quickly inserts that he was just 
   &quot;Fucking with<A HREF="red_sands_2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/red sands dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   you&quot;. Howston does not look amused, but if Howston was only 
   going to deal with mythical unicorns in the next two weeks, he would 
   be a happy faggot!). We then switch to the city of Kabul in 
   Afghanistan (The movie was actually filmed in Kabul, Afghanistan and 
   also in Morocco). It's September 2002 and Howston, along with Keller, 
   Chard (Brendan Miller), Trevor (Aldis Hodge), Gregory (Callum Blue) 
   and a few other soldiers (if this were <B><A HREF="star_trek_1966.htm">STAR
    TREK</A></B>, we would call them &quot;red shirts&quot;) are 
   patrolling the streets, both on foot and in vehicles, looking for 
   traces of Al-Qaeda. It is a tedious mission filled with boredom and 
   dust, with little children on the street asking the soldiers for a 
   &quot;biscuit?&quot; One day, their convoy comes under attack from 
   enemy fire while they are driving in the middle of the desert. They 
   stop their vehicle to recon the area and come across a strange statue 
   carved into the side of a mountain. Wise-ass Chard fires a bullet 
   into the statue, which causes it to crumble into a million pieces. 
   What Chard has done is release a vengeful Djinn, a human-hating 
   spirit that was trapped in the statue for thousands of years. The 
   soldiers make temporary headquarters at a bombed-out stone house 
   (where the former residents were killed by phosphorous bombs that 
   burned them alive to their bones) and pretty soon the Djinn begins 
   fucking with their minds and then their bodies. During one of their 
   patrols, they find an enemy camp that is eerily deserted, except for 
   one dead enemy combatant that was buried up to his chest and stoned 
   to death. Back at their temporary headquarters, they are hit with an 
   unusually long sandstorm and the sudden appearance of an Afghani 
   woman who seems scared shitless and rambles incoherently. Could this 
   be the same woman Keller sees in his strange recurring nightmares? Is 
   she the Djinn (That question is answered fairly early, as her arm 
   stretches like Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards in <B><A HREF="fantastic_four_2005.htm">FANTASTIC
    FOUR</A></B> [2005] when she reaches for a canteen of water.)? The 
   Djinn uses each soldier's worst memories against them (Gregory is 
   visited by an American soldier who he killed in a friendly fire 
   incident; Howston gets radio transmissions from an Afghani girl he 
   killed during a raid; etc), until they mentally crack and turn on 
   each other. When Gregory is found brutally murdered (his eyes are all 
   black) and the other soldiers start killing each other, only Keller 
   keeps a level head about himself and survives the ordeal, but is it 
   the real Keller that is being grilled by his superiors in the 
   beginning of the film or the Djinn (That question is answered in the 
   film's creepy closing shot.)?&nbsp; This is a slow (some horror fans 
   would say it is too slow), methodical and psychological horror film 
   that doesn't play its entire hand all at once. One thing this film 
   does particularly well is show how American soldiers are truly 
   &quot;strangers in a strange land&quot; when forced to occupy 
   territories they really have no business (nevermind no understanding 
   of traditions) to be in. While there is some blood and gore on 
   display (especially the gaping head wound of the American soldier 
   Gregory accidentally shot), this film is more about mood and 
   atmosphere (you'll get dry mouth from all the sand on display here). 
   Particularly telling is the scene where Howston (who is quite crazy 
   at this point) catches Chard raping the woman and pulls him off her. 
   Instead of being upset about the attempted rape, Howston takes 
   offense to Chard calling him a &quot;nigger&quot; and stabs him to 
   death. This is a film about identity, both real and perceived, and 
   how being in an unfamiliar place for too long can fuck with those 
   perceptions (as real-life American soldiers stationed in Afghanistan 
   will readily tell you). The only disappointment here is the Djinn 
   itself. When it is finally shown in the film's final twenty minutes, 
   it is nothing but an obviously bad CGI creation, which is neither 
   scary or believable. Other than that, <B><A HREF="red_sands_2008b.htm">RED
    SANDS</A></B> is an effectively frightening film which evokes what 
   scares us the most: Fear of our own worst memories coming back to

    REDWOOD MASSACRE</A><A NAME="RedwoodMassacre2014"></A> (2014) -</B> 
   There have been an awful lot of horror films coming from Ireland and 
   Scotland lately (this one is from Scotland) and if you like gore, 
   you'll probably love this film, but if you want a coherent plot with 
   characters you give two shits about, look somewhere else. It could be 
   because director/screenwriter David Ryan Keith (<B><A HREF="attack_of_the_herbals_2011.htm">ATTACK
    OF THE HERBALS</A></B> - 2011) took on six other important jobs in 
   the film (cinematographer, editor, co-producer, digital effects 
   supervisor, sound editor and camera operator), rather than give them 
   to someone else to do, because the film has many continuity errors 
   and an over-reliance of normal slasher film conventions to make it 
   stand out from the pack. Sure, it's bloody as hell, but even that 
   becomes boring after a while because many of the kills are the same <A HREF="redwood_massacre_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/redwood massacre 2014 poster6 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>and
    it then throws in a ton of torture porn, to boot. The film opens 
   with a bloody girl with a bad stomach wound in the woods at night 
   trying to avoid someone or something (it's never made clear whether 
   we are dealing with a man or a demon). She is then attacked by 
   someone dressed as a scarecrow (Benjamin Selway, who is listed as 
   &quot;Evil Maniac&quot; in the credits), who stabs her over and over 
   in the stomach until she falls on the ground. As she is trying to 
   crawl away the Evil Maniac hits her three times in the back with and 
   axe (really graphic) and then drags her away (The Evil Maniac does 
   the same exact thing to a bloke taking a piss in the woods a few 
   minutes later). When morning comes, four young adults decide to camp 
   at the same place where the Evil Maniac struck the night before (Mark 
   [Adam Coutts] has the nerve to bring his current and ex-girlfriend 
   along! He prophetically says to his current girlfriend Kristy [Lisa 
   Livingstone], &quot;Trust me. This is going to be a weekend you'll 
   never forget!&quot; But don't they say that in all slasher films?). 
   They are unaware that they are being watched closely by a hunter (Lee 
   Hutcheon; director/star of such films as <B><A HREF="my_brothers_keeper_2012.htm">MY
    BROTHER'S KEEPER</A></B> [2012], featuring a lot of the actors in 
   this film) a short distance away after he discovers the bloodpool of 
   the girl from the night before. But why is he watching them? It will 
   be answered. It wouldn't be so bad if every one of these four young 
   adults weren't annoying as fuck and, of course, there is no cell 
   service the farther they go into the woods. The last call they make 
   is to Bruce (Mark Wood), who is traveling by mountain bike to meet 
   them. Believe it or not, they are all going to a party to celebrate 
   the 20th anniversary of a multiple murder that happened there (Who in 
   their right mind celebrates a murder spree with a party?). Kristy 
   tells everyone about the mass murder that happened 20 years earlier: 
   A man known as &quot;The Farmer&quot; (Liam Matheson) and &quot;The 
   Redwood Massacre&quot;. The Farmer murders his wife by slicing open 
   her stomach and eating her innards (we are shown it all in 
   flashback). He then chops off his daughter's head (we don't see that) 
   and murders his son (again, we don't see it) and then supposedly 
   committed suicide, but his body disappeared from his grave. Bruce is 
   almost at his destination when he falls off his bike and is dragged 
   away by the Evil Maniac. The next morning, Kristy and Pamela (Lisa 
   Cameron; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LordOfDarkness2012">LORD OF DARKNESS</A></B> 
   - 2012) wake up from their tents, only to discover Mark and and his ex-girlfriend
    Jessica (Rebecca Wilkie) are missing and think they have headed to 
   The Farmer's house (Really? Without telling them?). They are actually 
   being held captive in the Evil Maniac's slaughterhouse (Big 
   continuity error. How did they get there? Is it possible director 
   Keith was too involved with his other occupations on the film to 
   recognize that he forgot to film the scene?), tied-up and gagged. Now 
   it's time for torture porn. The Evil Maniac picks up Jessica, ties 
   her to a table, stabs her in the stomach a couple of times with a 
   small curved blade (twisting the blade while it is in her), takes off 
   her gag and then stabs her over and over in the stomach so the guys 
   next door can hear her death throes. It is very bloody, but we have 
   already seen it done earlier in the film. The Evil Maniac then grabs 
   Mark and ties him to a chair, while Bruce breaks free and grabs an 
   axe, but instead of trying to save Mark (who has just had an axe 
   planted between his legs and then has the top of his head cut off 
   with a hacksaw; once again, nothing is left to the imagination), 
   Bruce turns chicken and heads in the opposite direction, but the 
   slaughterhouse is very big. The Evil Maniac puts bits of Mark and 
   Jessica in mason jars in case he gets hungry later on. Meanwhile, 
   Pamela and Kristy make it to The Farmer's deserted house, not knowing 
   that it is the living area for the Evil Maniac (Jesus, I am getting 
   tired of all these stupid young adults). They find a dead fox in the 
   bathroom, but that will be the least of their problems. Bruce and the 
   Evil Maniac play a game of cat and mouse (Guess who's the mouse?), 
   where Bruce discovers the body of the girl killed at the beginning of 
   the film in a wooden box. The Evil Maniac beats the shit out of Bruce 
   and takes him prisoner again, where he kills Bruce with some unseen 
   torture. Pamela and Kristy decide to spend the night in The Farmer's 
   deserted house (Yes, these girls are missing a few brain cells). 
   After killing Bruce, the Evil Maniac chases Kristy with an axe, 
   catches her, stabs her in the stomach with a huge blade and then 
   begins to pull out her internal organs while she watches, still 
   alive. Pamela does the regular stupid young adult thing and runs 
   towards Kristy's screams and ends up in the slaughterhouse, where she 
   secretly watches the Evil Maniac chop someone into pieces with an 
   axe. The hunter (remember him?) puts the barrel of a shotgun to 
   Pamela's head and says, &quot;Don't look at me.&quot; in a whisper. 
   He is there to kill the Evil Maniac because he killed his daughter 
   ten years earlier and he has been searching for him ever since. He 
   says to Pamela, &quot;You people. You think it's a fucking game. You 
   have no idea what this thing can do. There is no end...this is just 
   the beginning.&quot; (It's probably the most adult thing that Pamela 
   has ever heard in her life.). He tells Pamela to leave because all 
   her friends are dead, but Pamela refuses to leave and wants to help 
   the hunter get payback. The Evil Maniac shows up and the hunter puts 
   a shotgun blast into him with no effect. He gives Pamela the shotgun 
   and tells her to run away. He faces down the Evil Maniac and tells 
   him, &quot;Makes no difference if I live or die. I died a long time 
   ago.&quot; The Evil Maniac then runs him through with a machete and 
   then stabs him through the top of his head (Ten years of searching for<A HREF="redwood_massacre_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/redwood massacre 2014 poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   this? It just seems so...stupid.). The Evil Maniac then goes after 
   Pamela (she has to run through a gauntlet of hanging bodies, some 
   still barely alive and some of them her friends) and catches her, 
   punching her over and over in the face until it becomes bloody filmic 
   overkill. But, somehow, the hunter shows up to buy Pamela some time 
   (but the Evil Maniac punches his fist clear through the hunter's 
   body) to grab the shotgun and shoot the Evil Maniac in the face. Is 
   it finally over? Pamela runs like hell through the woods until she 
   comes to a road and is picked up by a man in a van. Pamela passes out 
   from exhaustion, but the driver wakes her up a couple of hours later 
   and tells her that he got lost and believes they have been driving in 
   circles, ending back at The Farmer's deserted house (Really?). The 
   Evil Maniac slits the van driver's throat and chases Pamela into an 
   auto graveyard (Judging by the newer model of cars in the graveyard, 
   I wouldn't be wrong to hazard a guess that these are the cars of the 
   Evil Maniac's victims over the years). After the Evil Maniac delivers 
   more punches to her face (She is going to be sore in the morning!), 
   Pamela jumps into one of those giant magnet vehicles and drops a car 
   on top of the Evil Maniac (How does she even know how to operate one 
   of these big machines?). Before the closing credits begin to roll, 
   Pamela says, &quot;Fucking Farmers!&quot;&nbsp; Besides <B><A HREF="redwood_massacre_2014b.htm">THE
    REDWOOD MASSACRE</A></B> being a lot bloodier than your normal 
   slasher film (the closing credits thank the company that supplied 
   them with gallons of fake blood!), this is just another mindless 
   slasher flick that asks a lot of questions and offers no answers. 
   Just who is the Evil Maniac? Is he The Farmer or something more 
   supernatural? If the Evil Maniac can survive a point-blank shotgun 
   blast to his face (which we never see since he never takes off the 
   scarecrow mask), he sure as hell can survive having a car dropped on 
   him. so I wouldn't be surprised if there will be a sequel in the 
   future. And don't get me started on the continuity. It jumps from 
   scene-to-scene with no connective tissue, like huge chunks of the 
   screenplay were thrown away in the name of pacing (it is quick-paced, 
   even though it took 35 days to shoot this 82-minute film). The next 
   time, I hope David Ryan Keith just sticks with directing and writing 
   and leaves the other jobs to qualified people. This way he could 
   spend more time making sense of his films and not leaving us asking 
   questions that we shouldn't be asking. If you are a gorehound, this 
   film will delight you. If it's involving characters or plots you 
   want, look somewhere else. This film does serve a purpose for a 
   specialty crowd and, while I enjoy lots of gore just like every other 
   horror film fan, I also appreciate some time building up the 
   characters so we have people we care for. Keith fails miserably in 
   that department. A little less H.G. Lewis and a little more John 
   Carpenter. It's a well-made film, although it's apparent that some of 
   the Scottish actors are trying a little too hard to speak American 
   (especially Kristy) and there's also a total lack of nudity, so don't 
   go looking for it here. Also featuring Claire Beam, Morgan Keith,

   (2005) -</B> Five college students, on their way to a rave in the

   stuck in time. They find themselves trapped at an abandoned 
   motel/caf&eacute;, where, a few short hours before, it was teeming 
   with customers. The students, Jack (Devon Gummersall; <B><A HREF="earth_vs_the_spider_2001.htm">EARTH

   Ecstasy from drug dealer Radford (Eric Mabius; <B><A HREF="resident_evil_2002.htm">RESIDENT
    EVIL</A></B> - 2002), try to figure out why they seem to be all 
   alone (a lone radio signal implies that there has been some kind of 
   toxic spill which has closed down all the roads), while a creature 
   called a Reeker (David Hadinger) goes <A HREF="reeker_2005.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/reeker dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="201" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>on
    a killing spree. Only the blind Jack senses that something 
   extraordinarily wrong is going on, as the stench of decaying flesh 
   fills the air. Trip heads out on his own on his skateboard to look 
   for help and runs into Radford, whose car has broken down. While Trip 
   is trying to avoid the wrath of Radford, he meets Henry (Michael 
   Ironside; <B><A HREF="watchers_1988.htm">WATCHERS</A></B> - 1988, in 
   what amounts to nothing more than an extended cameo), who is looking 
   for his missing wife Rose (Marcia Strassman, also in a 
   blink-it-and-you'll-miss-it cameo). There's something off about 
   Henry, who drives Trip back to the motel and also confides in him 
   that he's seeing dead people (This happens after Trip pulls a living 
   dead trucker, missing the lower half of his body, out of a garbage 
   bin and it scuddles away by walking on it's hands!). Trip tries to 
   siphon gas out of Henry's RV (in a funny bit, Trip mistakenly siphons 
   the RV's septic tank first), unaware that the Reeker has already 
   killed Henry (whenever the Reeker kills someone, they literally see 
   their lives flash before their eyes). Trip begins seeing all the dead 
   people, which means that he's the next victim of the Reeker's wrath 
   (which is a shame, because he's the film's most interesting 
   character). Cookie and Nelson are the next to die, while Jack and 
   Gretchen try to fit all the pieces of the deadly puzzle together. 
   Trip turns up briefly (minus an arm), just long enough to fill Jack 
   and Gretchen in on what they are dealing with (Trip says to Jack, 
   &quot;At least you can still whack-off!&quot; to which Jack dryly 
   replies, &quot;Use your other arm.&quot;), before he is really 
   dispatched by the Reeker (who has a huge mechanical drain snake-like 
   device in place of it's right arm), leaving Jack to use his 
   heightened sense of smell to try and save their lives. What happens 
   next is creative, as well as poignant, even if it doesn't make a lick 
   of sense.&nbsp; Not a bad little horror film considering it's low 
   budget, director/screenwriter/co-producer Dave Payne (<B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Not Like Us">NOT

    TERMINATOR</A></B> - 1996), who also composed the music soundtrack, 
   manages to cram a lot of humor and tense situations into a story that 
   is full of unique ideas, which is why Payne probably remade the film 
   with a slightly larger budget as <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NoMansLandReeker">NO
    MAN'S LAND: RISE OF THE REEKER</A></B> in 2008 (which I found a 
   little more satisfying than this if only because it expands on this 
   film's premise). Not everything works here (For starters, the Reeker 
   is a terribly underwritten character), but Payne at least tries to be 
   different from the countless other DTV horror flicks that don't have 
   an original idea in their tiny little heads. The makeup effects, 
   using both practical effects and CGI, are very bloody (the film gets 
   off to a gory start when a vacationing family hits a deer with their 
   car and suffer a far worse fate than the deer, including the family's 
   poor pet dog), but are used sparingly, so when they do come into 
   play, they are shocking and effective. While not everything succeeds 
   in <B><A HREF="reeker_2005.htm">REEKER</A></B>, I applaud Dave Payne 
   for giving us a horror film that's funny without being overly jokey 
   (some of the dialogue is inspired, including how Jack's blindness led 
   to a lawsuit mandating that lawn darts be made out of plastic instead 
   of metal) and complicated enough to actually make us use our brains 
   (the finale is unique and well-done). Make sure to read to the final 
   credits for Payne's funny take on film reviewers. I won't hold it

    WASP WOMAN</A></B> (1959), Mrs. Ruth Warren (Jessica Dublin), a 
   wealthy old woman, funds a top secret project of Dr. Ashton (John 
   MacKay). It's a youth serum he has developed by extracting fluids 
   from the brains of the recently deceased. There's only one drawback: 
   The serum is temporary and it also has some other serious physical 
   and psychological side effects. Mrs. Warren, who was an actress in 
   her younger years and wishes to be a young actress again (&quot;Only<A HREF="rejuvenator_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/rejuvenator vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="123" HEIGHT="246" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   young actors get the good parts.&quot;), pressures Dr. Ashton to use 
   the serum on her before his animal testing is complete. He relents 
   and injects her with the serum. At first, things go perfectly, as 
   Ruth becomes a vibrant young woman (played by Vivian Lanko) but, 
   since this is a horror film, things go horribly wrong pretty quickly. 
   The serum is like heroin, as the more Ruth uses it, the more her body 
   becomes tolerant to it. As her demands for the serum grows, the 
   demand for cadavers rises in kind. You can see where this is heading. 
   When the supply of dead bodies dries up, murder becomes necessary to 
   keep Mrs. Warren beautiful. To hide her true identity, the young Mrs. 
   Warren passes herself off as Elizabeth, the niece of Mrs. Warren. 
   Elizabeth and Dr. Ashton begin an affair, much to the displeasure of 
   her lifelong manservant Wilhelm (James Hogue), who has been holding a 
   torch for Mrs. Warren for many years. Dr. Ashton should have kept a 
   closer eye on his test rat. It has morphed into a hideous 
   bloodthirsty monster, which is exactly what Elizabeth turns into when 
   she doesn't get her injections in time. Elizabeth ends up cruising 
   bars, killing men and women so Dr. Ashton can get the brain juce he 
   needs to make the serum. She even goes as far as removing the brains 
   of her victims with her bare hands. When Elizabeth discovers that 
   eating the brains of her victims produces the same effect as the 
   serum, Dr. Ashton must find a way to synthesize the serum before more 
   people die. The best laid plans.......&nbsp; This splattery horror

   mother, saying &quot;You should have been my daughter!&quot;, yet she 
   bequeaths her entire fortune, including the mansion, to Helen, before 
   she downs a drink laced with strychnine and passes away on-screen. 
   Bob seems very happy about becoming an &quot;instant 
   millionaire&quot;, but Helen seems more worried about why the lawyer 
   refuses to go to the mansion with them. Once at the mansion (it looks 
   more like a split-level ranch than a mansion), Helen and Bob are 
   greeted by Lisa (Carol James), the maid, and Luis (Tony Isbert), the 
   butler/gardener and Helen notices a garage full of vintage cars, 
   including a Rolls Royce that starts-up by itself. Before they even 
   settle in, strange things begin to happen, like Bob's clothes 
   changing position in the bedroom closet and the bathroom suddenly 
   taking a life of its own, with the shower curtain nearly suffocating 
   Helen while she is taking a bath. Helen swears she saw a smiling 
   Catherine trying to kill her, but Bob thinks she just fell asleep in 
   the tub and the shower curtain came loose (Yeah, right, shit like 
   that happens every day!). Helen and Bob then meet all their strange 
   neighbors, including blind author David Hume (Jack Taylor), lesbian 
   Gertrude (Patty Shepard), Dr. Anderson (David Rose), Mr. Whitmore 
   (Robert Case) and Reverend Flaherty (Jeffrey Segal), who all live in 
   chalets on Aunt Catherine's property and don't pay a cent in rent 
   (which Bob finds peculiar). The neighbors also attend regularly 
   scheduled &quot;concerts&quot;, which end in some deadly ritual we 
   are not yet privy to. The neighbors feel that the sudden appearance 
   of Helen and Bob will put a damper on their &quot;concerts&quot;, but 
   Helen has more serious problems on her hands, like seeing Aunt 
   Catherine at the most inopportune times, getting obscene phone calls 
   and being locked in the garage and nearly asphyxiating on the exhaust 
   fumes. Is it possible that Aunt Catherine is still alive? And how is 
   it tied to the neighbors' &quot;concerts&quot;, where we find out 
   that they kill the classical musicians they hire to play, chop-up 
   their bodies and eat their flesh? Maybe the connection lies in the 
   abandoned house across the street and the fact that all the neighbors 
   committed suicide years ago? If Bob wasn't so interested in finding 
   Aunt Catherine's hidden money (she didn't believe in banks and there 
   is close to $8,000,000 somewhere in the house), maybe Helen wouldn't 
   have to put up with all this shit alone. Do you think you know how 
   this is going to end?&nbsp; Director Jose Ramon Larraz (<B><A HREF="whirlpool_1970.htm">WHIRLPOOL</A></B>-

   in his cane) and slashing people until they are bloody raw, then 
   chopping-up their bodies with meat cleavers for chow and discarding 
   the unwanted parts (like the feet) in a furnace. Some parts of the 
   film are shocking in the matter-of-factness way these neighbors are 
   shown killing their victims (including a classical string quartet who 
   never see it coming). While not without its faults (especially the 
   acting talents of the two leads and a flashback to a mass

   still an entertaining and bloody horror film. Also starring Daniel

    OF THE FAMILY MAN</A><A NAME="Return Family Man"></A> (1989) -</B> 
   Pretty bad South Africa-lensed horror flick that is full of 
   characters you want to grab by the collar and punch in the face. A 
   group of obnoxious overage teens, including pizza delivery boy Alden 
   (Liam Cundill), who is on the run from drug dealers after witnessing 
   a multiple murder in a deal gone wrong, vacation at a run-down 
   mansion deep in (what's supposed to be) the Pacific Northwest woods. 
   Trouble is, they are not alone in the mansion, as a notorious serial 
   killer known as the Family Man (Ron Smerczak) has just escaped after 
   killing everyone in the bus transporting him (including his fellow 
   prisoners) and he has come home (the mansion<A HREF="return_of_the_family_man_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/return of the family man vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="125" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   was his family home before he killed them all and ten other families 
   before being caught). Besides the nervous Alden, the rest of the cast 
   are straight out of Stereotypes 101: English Billy Idol-wannabe 
   Weasel (Adrian Galley); sexpot and bubblehead Libby (Debra Kaye); 
   good girl Vickie (Michelle Constant, who has a nose as big as the 
   great outdoors); Marty (Kurt Egelhof), a Hindi Indian who's great 
   with electronics (aren't they all?); Vickie's unfaithful boyfriend 
   Brian (Terence Reis); French foreign exchange student Sylvie 
   (Dominique Moser); and plain jane Evelyn (Victoria Bawcombe). After 
   55 minutes of sexual hijinks, house cleaning and baseball practice 
   (!), the Family Man finally arrives, kills Sylvie and the rest of the 
   group go looking for her the next morning. Brian finds a room hidden 
   behind a brick wall which contains the skeletal remains of the Family 
   Man's family and a small fortune in money, but doesn't get a chance 
   to tell anyone as the Family Man caves his head in with a 
   sledgehammer. The rest of the gang bands together and, with the help 
   of Marty's homemade weapons (including a bomb stuffed with nails and 
   an aerosol flame thrower), try to defend themselves from the maniac. 
   They fail, of course (he's virtually indestructable), but Alden, 
   Vickie and Weasel manage to trap the Family Man in an abandoned well 
   in the backyard and drop a huge propane tank on him that is detonated 
   with the late Marty's bomb. Rest in pieces, Family Man!&nbsp; 
   Directed (and co-written) by-the-numbers by John Murlowski (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Amityville Generati">AMITYVILLE:
    A NEW GENERATION</A></B> - 1993; <B><A HREF="contagion_2001.htm">CONTAGION</A></B> 
   - 2001), this is a slow-moving and rather bloodless slasher film. The 
   violence is tame, as the camera tends to pull away just as it's about 
   to get interesting. The best part is when Libby sets the Family Man's 
   head on fire with the homemade flame thrower. Rather than running 
   around screaming in pain, he calmly reaches for a towel, puts out the 
   flames (his whole head is a charred mess) and shoves Libby's face 
   into the spinning blades of a blender. What's really distracting 
   about this whole production (besides Michelle Constant's huge honker) 
   is that everyone talks in that English/German dialect that can only 
   come from South Africa. Why is it set in America in the first place? 
   When the sheriff (co-scripter Karl Johnson) says the word 
   &quot;peckerwood&quot; in his fake American accent, you'll either 
   laugh or throw your hands up in the air in disbelief. How come South 
   African filmmakers think all Americans speak with a Southern accent 
   and isn't this supposed to take place in the Pacific Northwest 
   anyway? Even with his accent, Ron Smerczak is quite good as the 
   family-hating serial killer. The problem is that director Murlowski 
   refuses to let him go full-tilt bozo and keeps it restrained when he 
   should be chewing up the scenery (as well as the cast). You can skip 
   this one unless you are a slasher film completist. A <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Raedon">Raedon

   jokes and visuals. Thankfully, <B><A HREF="return_of_the_living_dead_3.htm">RETURN
    OF THE LIVING DEAD III</A></B> goes in the exact opposite direction, 
   playing everything with a deadly serious tone and not leaving room 
   for much humor. Curt Reynolds (J. Trevor Edmond) steals his father's 
   high security keycard and brings his girlfriend Julie (Mindy Clarke), 
   who has an unhealthy obsession with death, to a top-secret government 
   lab to secretly watch his father, Col. John Reynolds (Kent McCord), 
   perform an experiment where he reanimates a corpse using the poison 
   gas 2-4-5 Trioxin in hopes of creating the perfect undead military 
   killing machine. When the experiment goes horribly wrong and a couple 
   of technicians end up dead (one of them is portrayed by genre 
   director Anthony Hickox), Col. Reynolds is immediately reassigned and 
   must report to another base in a different state in two weeks. When 
   he tells Curt that they will have to move yet again (being a military 
   brat is tough), Curt rebels and takes off on hjis motorcycle with 
   Julie as his passenger, only to end up getting into an accident where 
   Julie slams into a telephone pole and dies. Curt gets the bright idea 
   to bring Julie back to life using the 2-4-5 Trioxin, so he brings her 
   back to the lab, opens a canister of the gas and revives her. He is 
   not quite prepared to handle what he has just created. When Julie 
   complains that she is &quot;hungry&quot;, he brings her to a 
   convenience store, where they run afoul of a Spanish gang led by 
   Santos (Mike Moroff), that ends with Julie biting one of the gang 
   members and the store manager getting shot. This sets off a series of 
   events where Julie begins chowing-down on the brains of several 
   people, leading Curt and Julie to escape into the sewers, where they 
   are befriended by a crazy coot named Riverman (Basil Wallace). Santos 
   and his gang follow them into the sewer, while Col. Reynolds is left 
   with the chore of cleaning-up Julie's messes and containing the 
   infectious outbreak. Julie is able to temporarily curb her hunger by 
   self-inflicting severe pain, so she begins piercing every inch of her 
   body with any sharp object she can find, including nails, coil 
   springs and shards of metal and glass. She is not able to sate her 
   appetite for very long, though, and soon begins putting the bite on ever<A HREF="return_of_the_living_dead_3.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/return of the living dead 3 vhs ad small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="275" HEIGHT="154" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>yone
    she runs across. Just as she is about to devour Curt, Col. Reynolds 
   saves the day and stops her with an experimental rifle that instantly 
   freezes the infected. Julie is brought back to the lab, where she is 
   to be used in a new experiment conducted by Col. Reynolds' 
   replacement, Lt. Col. Sinclair (Sarah Douglas). When Curt catches a 
   glimpse of what is about to happen to Julie, he sets her free, which 
   results in the entire facility going into lockdown when a horde of 
   the infected undead are released in the melee. It all ends on a 
   fatalistic, but fitting, note.&nbsp; Besides a few lapses in logic 
   (Why in the hell would they bring Curt back to the lab and let him 
   walk around freely?) and some hinky acting (especially by Pia Reeves, 
   who portrays Alicia, the female member of Santos' gang), this film is 
   a bloody good show that is bolstered immensely by Mindy (later known 
   as Melinda) Clarke's nuanced performance as Julie. She's simply 
   wonderful here as a girl who was clearly troubled when alive, which 
   only makes her undead status all the more fascinating and tragic.

   the makeup effects department. People are gnawed, eaten, ripped apart 
   (especially Santos getting his head ripped away from his body with 
   the spinal column still attached) and shotgunned, but nothing comes 
   close to Julie's ritualistic piercing of her entire body. It's a

    &amp; BREAKFAST</A></B> - 2004) investigating the mysterious death 
   of Ariel's sister Sara (played in the 1999 film by Ali Larter), who 
   was only one of two survivors of the original film. It seems Sara was 
   killed by Desmond and his gang because she had Dr. Vannacutt's 
   journal, which details the location of an ancient artifact known as 
   Baphomet's Idol, which is highly sought after by Richard and Desmond, 
   a former student of Richard's who now works for anyone who is the 
   highest bidder for the idol. Sara mailed the journal to Ariel, so 
   Desmond kidnaps her and Paul and heads for the titled house, only to 
   find Richard and his assistants already there. The journal mentions 
   that the idol is located in a secret room somewhere in the house's 
   basement, so everyone agrees to split-up into groups of two (a horror 
   plot device as old as film itself) to go look for it. As in the first 
   film, the house goes into lockdown mode, so everyone is trapped 
   inside and the killings begin. The first ones to die are two of 
   Desmond's goons, Warren (Chucky Venice; <B><A HREF="#WrongTurn3">WRONG
    TURN 3: LEFT FOR DEAD</A></B> - 2009), who gets his guts ripped out 
   by a ghost before being pulled through a tiny hole in the wall, and 
   Harue (Kalita Rainford), who has her face cut off by Dr. Vannacutt (a 
   well-done and gory effect) after being seduced by two naked female 
   ghosts (another modern film fact: all female bad girls are lesbians). 
   While Ariel gets psychic warnings from her dead sister and other 
   ghosts, the killings continue, including musclebound goon Norris (Gil 
   Kolirin), who gets drawn-and-quartered by sheets (!); goon Samuel 
   (Andrew Pleavin), who has the top of his head removed and his brain 
   twisted out; Kyle, who is drowned by ghosts in a basement pool; 
   Michelle, who has a refrigerator dropped on her head; and Desmond, 
   who is thrown in a crematorium and burned alive. Ariel finds 
   Baphomet's Idol and she and Paul try to escape the house, while a 
   possessed Richard, Dr. Vannacutt and the asylum's ghosts try their 
   best to kill everyone. Like the first film, only two make it out 
   alive.&nbsp; This is strictly a by-the-numbers DTV sequel, directed 
   by Victor Garcia (who also directed the internet prequel <B><A HREF="30_days_of_night_blood_trails_2007.htm">30
    DAYS OF NIGHT: BLOOD TRAILS</A></B> [2007] for the defunct FearNet) 
   and written by William Massa that has very little to offer storywise. 
   The Baphomet Idol plotline is not only far-fetched (Why would Dr. 
   Vannacutt possess such an item in the first place and where did he 
   get it from?), the idol's powers are never fully explained. But if 
   it's blood, guts and nudity you want, this film delivers all three in 
   spades (much moreso than the 1999 remake). I'm also happy to report 
   that most of the gore effects are practical in nature and CGI, while 
   still present, isn't quite as obvious as most DTV productions. It's 
   also apparent that this wasn't filmed in the same house as the 1999 
   original (this is supposed to take place in Los Angeles, but was 
   actually filmed in Bulgaria). The original house had a personality 
   all its own, while the house here seems more like an underground 
   bunker than a house and besides some exterior shots of the original 
   house and one interior set that tries to copy the first film's main 
   room (complete with stained glass littering the floor and the table 
   that had the miniature coffins that held the guns), it bears no 
   resemblance to the original. Still, it's a quick 81 minutes and I've 
   seen much worse. Stay tuned after the closing credits for a final 
   stinger, which sets-up a sequel that takes the action away from the 
   house. A sequel which, as of this writing, has yet to be made. <B><A HREF="return_to_house_on_haunted_hill_2007b.htm">RETURN

   It's been 25 years since the infamous murder spree at Camp Arawak, 
   committed by transgendered teen Angela Baker (Felissa Rose; <B><A HREF="corpses_are_forever_2003.htm">CORPSES
    ARE FOREVER</A></B> - 2003; <B><A HREF="dead_and_gone_2007.htm">DEAD 
   AND GONE</A></B> - 2007). Well, the camp has been reopened, renamed 
   (to Camp Manabe) and restaffed by new owner Frank (Vincent Pastore; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Black Roses">BLACK
    ROSES</A></B> - 1988). Yes, it's a recipe for a new disaster. This 
   film centers on fat, pug-nosed, loud-mouthed and repugnant camp 
   member Alan (Michael Gibney), who doesn't get along with anyone, 
   including the other kids in his cabin and camp counselor Randy (Brye 
   Cooper), who seems to take pleasure in torturing Alan (It's not like 
   Alan doesn't deserve it, though, because he's really an annoying sack 
   of shit). When Alan goes to the camp's kitchen, run by Chef Charlie 
   (the late Isaac Hayes in a cameo parodying his Chef character on <B><A HREF="south_park_movie.htm">SOUTH
    PARK</A></B>), he gets into a fight with kitchen staffer Mickey 
   (Lenny Vento) and almost kills Mickey by throwing a butcher knife at 
   him. Frank wants to punish Alan, but he runs away into the woods 
   (after calling Frank a &quot;Big Pussy&quot;, a sly reference to 
   Pastore's Mob nickname on <B><A HREF="sopranos_tv.htm">THE SOPRANOS</A></B>),
    so Frank sends Alan's half-brother Michael (Michael Werner) to go 
   fetch him. A short time later, Mickey is dunked head-first into the 
   deep fryer by someone wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and black 
   gloves, who then puts Mickey's body into a plastic bag and stuffs him 
   in the trash compactor. Is it possible that Alan is the killer? Alan 
   has the hots for<A HREF="return_to_sleepaway_camp_2003.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/return to sleepaway camp dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="280" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   female camper Karen (Erin Broderick), but fellow campers T.C. 
   (Christopher Shand) and Bella (Shahidah McIntosh), as well as stoners 
   Weed (Adam Wylie) and Stan (Chaz Brewer), who make Alan smoke a joint 
   containing cow manure, are always picking on him and interrupting his 
   romantic overtures (if you want to call them that). Later that night, 
   the killer ties-up Weed, force-feeds him gasoline and sticks a joint 
   in his mouth, forcing Weed to go up in flames from the inside out 
   when the joint is lit. Is it possible Alan is the killer? Sheriff 
   Jerry looks into the rumor that Angela Baker has escaped from the 
   insane asylum, so he interviews Angela's brother Ricky (Jonathan 
   Tiersten, returning from the first film), who assures the sheriff 
   that Angela is still locked up. Alan keeps suffering humiliation 
   after humiliation (everyone at paintball uses him as a target; 
   Michael skins all of his pet frogs; T.C. gives him an atomic wedgie 
   and throws him in the lake in front of all the other campers, where 
   they learn he cannot swim; Karen tricks him into playing Spin The 
   Bottle, only to have him appear with his pants around his ankles on 
   the camp's stage), until he snaps and runs away. Then the killings 
   really start. Frank has his head trapped in a birdcage while the 
   killer sticks a rat in the cage to keep him company. Randy is tied to 
   a tree and has his family jewels yanked-off with fishing line. 
   Randy's girlfriend Linda (Jackie Tohn) gets a barb wire necktie. T.C. 
   gets a sharp stick rammed through his eye and Bella dies when a bed 
   of nails falls on her. Is Alan the real killer or is it someone else?

   Oh my god, this is a bad film (originally lensed in 2003, but not 
   obtaining a release until 2008), but it's bad in the best way 
   possible. Director/screenwriter Robert Hiltzig, who performed the 
   same duties in the original <B><A HREF="sleepaway_camp_1983.htm">SLEEPAWAY

   Anchor Bay Entertainment's <B><A HREF="sleepaway_camp_survival_kit.htm">SLEEPAWAY

   acting (Michael Gibney as Alan is so over-the-top, he transcends 
   badness and enters a whole new plateau of &quot;acting&quot;. Paul 
   DeAngelo, one of the returning actors from the original film [he 
   plays sympathetic counselor Ronnie here] proves he hasn't learned a 
   lick of acting in 25 years) and red herrings, but the killer is so 
   obvious, you'll have to be blind not to spot it. As soon as the 
   character of Sheriff Jerry is introduced early in the film, it's 
   quite plain to see that it is actress Felissa Rose under heavy makeup 
   (a beard and a ridiculous fake nose). The fact that Sheriff Jerry can 
   only speak with one of those electronic voice wands (supposedly 
   because of cancer caused by smoking) is another plot device that tips 
   its hand much too early, so when Angela finally reveals her true self 
   in the film's closing moments (and she does the same scream she did 
   in the finale of the first film, minus the penis shot), the only one 
   who should be surprised is the family dog (and it would have to be 
   one dumb dog!). I do have to say that this film does have its 
   perverse charms and some of the effects are very gory, but this is by 
   no means a whole-hearted recommendation on my part. It's terrible, 
   but it wallows in its terribleness, which makes it slightly more 
   watchable than the average badfilm. Make sure you stay until after 
   the closing credits to see the film's bloodiest effect. Also starring 
   Kate Simses, Jaime Radon, Paul Iacono and Jake O'Conner. A Magnolia

    OF BILLY THE KID</A><A NAME="RevengeBillyTheKid"></A> (1991) -</B> 
   Gross-out horror comedy from Britain. The MacDonald Farm (on an 
   island that no one else lives on) is occupied by a family that can 
   best be described as slobs and perverts, with one exception. There's 
   hard-drinking father Gyles MacDonald (Ronald Balfour), who spits on 
   pigs, throws buckets at chickens and takes extreme pleasure in 
   milking the family goat every morning. And then there's the mother, 
   Gretta MacDonald (Jackie D. Broad), an overweight sow of a woman 
   whose missing teeth equals her IQ. Then there's their two sons, both 
   named Ronald (Bryan Heeley and Trevor Peake), who are both so stupid, 
   they couldn't count the fingers on one hand, even with the use of a 
   calculator. The one exception in the MacDonald family is daughter 
   Ronnie (Samantha Perkins), who is a bit fed up <A HREF="revenge_of_billy_the_kid_1991.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/revenge of billy the kid british dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>with
    her family's crude ways (When Granddad MacDonald [producer and 
   co-scripter Tim Dennison] dies at the breakfast table [complete with 
   several loud burps and farts], the Ronald brothers and Ma fight over 
   his food and eventually dump his body on a rather large dung pile in 
   the middle of their backyard) and yearns to get away from this slob 
   of a family before it is too late (Dad named her Ronald, too, but she 
   uses the name Ronnie instead). Ronnie, who is as bright as a broken 
   light bulb, has fallen in love with a &quot;mainlander&quot;, much to 
   Ma's discontent (She calls Ronnie a &quot;jezebel&quot; for cheating 
   on her brothers!), but Ronnie takes the rowboat to the mainland to 
   meet her true love, Lance Abbott (Dean Williamson), whose father, Mr. 
   Abbott (Norman Mitchell), owns the local butcher shop (Where they 
   sell more gross items like maggots and condoms with feathers than 
   actual meat). It seems the mainland is just as slovenly and unkempt 
   as the MacDonald's Island, as the mainland streets are lined with 
   drooling idiots, armless painters (a swipe at <B><A HREF="my_left_foot_1989.htm">MY
    LEFT FOOT</A></B> - 1989) and loonies of all types. Lance and Ronnie 
   are the closest people in either place that would pass for normal, 
   although if they were to have children, they would certainly be 
   considered retards to even the most conservative society. Something 
   awful happened years earlier between the MacDonald family and the 
   mainlanders, something so bad, no one dares to talk about it, but it 
   will never be forgotten. One day, Pa gets drunk and fucks the family 
   goat (he took her out to pasture to stud but decided he would be the 
   better stud instead!). A few months later, the goat gives birth to a 
   mutant, which Pa wants to kill immediately, but Ronnie grows fond of 
   it. She names him Billy and raises him as her pet, teaching him how 
   to play fetch and giving him lots of love. Alas, Billy is a killer at 
   heart and escapes from Ronnie, first eating small animals like 
   rabbits but, as he gets bigger, Billy turns his attention to larger 
   animals and eventually humans, starting with Granddad's rotting 
   corpse on the dung pile. Pa grows tired of Billy's constant meddling 
   with his still, so he knocks him out, puts him in a sack and drowns 
   him in the ocean. Or so he thought. The rest of the film details the 
   title of the film, as a pissed-off Billy makes life on the 
   MacDonald's farm e-i-e-i-ouch! It's hard to grade a film like this 
   when it is obvious director Jim Groom (<B><A HREF="room_36_2002.htm">ROOM
    36</A></B> - 2002), who co-wrote the screenplay with Tim Dennison 
   and Richard Mathews, wants to keep everything tongue-in-cheek, even 
   the gore sequences. I have to admit, I found myself laughing out loud 
   on several occasions in spite of myself. The humor here is of the 
   lowest common denominator, but no one does this type of humor better 
   than the British and this film won me over strictly because it 
   doesn't pretend to cater to intellectuals. The various growth stages 
   of Billy (listed as &quot;Billy T. Kid&quot; in the credits) is a 
   hoot and a half to watch (especially Billy's inventive POV shots) and 
   the gore is nasty and very well done. The sight gags, such as the 
   entire MacDonald clan sleeping in the same bed; a torn <B><A HREF="evil_dead_1983.htm">EVIL
    DEAD</A></B> poster on Lance's bedroom wall (a definite influence on 
   this film); Pa lubing Ma with a bucket of lard before fucking her; Pa 
   shotgunning a rooster for waking him up; and others too numerous to 
   mention in this review, make this film move at a brisk pace. As long 
   as you don't mind toilet humor (most of it literal toilet humor!) 
   mixed with bloody gore, <B><A HREF="revenge_of_billy_the_kid_1991b.htm">REVENGE
    OF BILLY THE KID</A></B> is sure to get your blood pumping and give 
   your laugh muscles a good workout. Also starring John Gugolka, John 
   Abbott and a cameo by Hammer Films veteran Michael Ripper (this is 
   his last film appearance) as a pub local. Never released legitimately 
   in the U.S. on home video, you can purchase the British DVD from

   Chess. He also has the hots for Carlotta and when he forces himself 
   on her in her apartment complex (in all fairness, Carlotta doesn't 
   put up much of a fight as she, too, is horny for the love of a man 
   other than Satan), Lucifer appears, the Professor runs away and 
   Lucifer boffs Carlotta (The life of a fallen angel is never easy!). 
   Carlotta is fearful that Daria will become just like her; a wealthy 
   woman without a human soul and no joy in her life at all,&nbsp; who 
   is cursed by Lucifer's laws and edicts, so she is willing to try

   pentagram, but it ends rather badly. Carlotta then tries to battle 
   Lucifer's power over Daria on her own, but will she succeed? Or will 
   Lucifer once again win this &quot;game&quot;?. The finale tells us 
   the answer, as Daria takes a taxi to the Vatican and is about to 
   battle the Pope! Which is actually more evil: Daria or the Catholic 
   Church? That's a hard question to answer, since both cover-up their 
   evil-doings (I would like to think Daria won, as it would help to 
   explain how a certain soulless reality star was able to become 
   President of the United States!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This little-seen supernatural horror film was obviously influenced 
   by <B><A HREF="exorcist.htm">THE EXORCIST</A></B> (1973), even though 
   this film's director/screenwriter Pier Carpi (whose only other 
   directorial effort was <B><A HREF="poor_christ_1976.htm">POOR CHRIST</A></B> 
   - 1976, a review written by our own Steven Jackson, which can be read <A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#PoorChrist1976">HERE</A>),
    billed here using the pseudonym &quot;Peter Karp&quot;, denies it, 
   saying his film is based on a novel he wrote in the late-'60s (which 
   wasn't published until 1974!). After watching the film, all I can say 
   is that, even in this version, which was released in 1979, there are 
   many similarities, but it still has some originality that can't be 
   denied. I say &quot;this version&quot; because the original film was 
   started in 1975 and finished in 1977, but Executive Producer Piero 
   Amati ordered extensive reshoots and recutting (editing out over 20 
   minutes of footage), because he thought it resembled director William 
   Friedkin's 1973 classic film too much and feared they may be sued by 
   Warner Bros (as they did successfully with 1974's <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Abby">ABBY</A></B> 
   and unsuccessfully with <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BeyondTheDoor1974">BEYOND
    THE DOOR</A></B> - 1974). That's not to say this film suffers 
   because of the recutting and reshooting because it doesn't (although 
   some of the actors here, such as Frank Findlay [<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#TwistedNerve1968">TWISTED
    NERVE</A></B> - 1968], as Carlotta's best friend Paul, and Paola 
   Tedesco as Anna, have their scenes cut to the bare bones). This film 
   is full of eye-opening nudity, plenty of bloody gore and a great cast 
   of Italian genre pros, all of whom do their best to gets your minds 
   off Linda Blair. But do they succeed?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Not only does this re-edited version have many scenes that will 
   remind you of the 1973 horror masterpiece (it still hoilds up today), 
   there are also many references to other American horror classics, 
   including <B><A HREF="rosemarys_baby_1968.htm">ROSEMARY'S BABY</A></B> 
   (1968), <B><A HREF="omen_1976.htm">THE OMEN</A></B> (1976), <B><A HREF="damien_omen_2_1978.htm">DAMIEN:
    OMEN II</A></B> (1978) and others, but that is to be taken for 
   granted since most Italian genre films (with the exception of giallo 
   flicks) don't have an original idea in their tiny little heads, but 
   that doesn't mean they can't be appreciated and enjoyed for their 
   Italian sensibilities, including copious full-frontal female nudity 
   and gory violence, which this film has in spades. Not only do all the 
   women here have nude scenes, it should also be noted that Lara 
   Wendel, who was thirteen at the time, also has plenty of nude scenes 
   and we never see her face and naughty bits (or as Steven would say, 
   her &quot;proud mary&quot;!) in the same shot until the finale, but 
   even then it just doesn't look right, like Lara's face was 
   super-imposed on another actress' body. I would like to think it was 
   a body double, but with these crazy Italians and their weird film 
   customs (such as creating and filming real life animal deaths for 
   &quot;entertainment value&quot;), I just don't know, it may be Ms. 
   Wendel herself. I do know one thing, director Carpi manages to 
   extract a very good performance from&nbsp; Lara Wendel and if you 
   have seen any of her other film performances, such as in <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#YoullDieMidnight86">YOU'LL
    DIE AT MIDNIGHT</A></B> (1986), the previously mentioned <B><A HREF="zombie_5_killing_birds_1987.htm">KILLING
    BIRDS</A></B> (1987), <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Ghosthouse 1987">GHOSTHOUSE</A></B> 
   (1987) and <B><A HREF="#RedMonks1988">THE RED MONKS</A></B> (1988), 
   you'll know that's kind of a big deal, as her performances in those 
   films were lackluster at best. She is so good as Daria that I wanted 
   to strangle her with my bare hands for the cruel and dastardly things 
   she says and does to people here, especially her own mother, and I 
   abhor violence against women! When Carlotta trims Daria's 
   fingernails, Daria takes the clippings and buries them in the dirt of 
   a potted plant, telling her mother, &quot;You know as well as I do, 
   no one should ever have access to the dead parts of our bodies.&quot; 
   Daria also has a habit of stealing dolls from stores and when Peter 
   gives her a Barbie doll as a present, she throws it off of a bridge 
   to the water below (never even opening the box it is wrapped in), 
   saying to her &quot;father&quot;, &quot;What do you expect me to do 
   with a doll that's been bought?&quot; At a custody hearing, Daria 
   tells a lawyer that she wants to live with her mother, saying that 
   Peter will die very soon. She then goes home and uses a secret 
   three-finger salute (that the witches use to greet each other) on 
   Peter's photo, which causes his plane to crash (offscreen). When 
   Carlotta tells Daria that Peter is dead, the victim of a plane crash, 
   Daria replies, &quot;I know. I told the lawyer that this 
   morning.&quot; It is an excellent performance in a very entertaining 
   supernatural horror film. Pier Carpi, who died in 2000 at the age of 
   sixty, didn't have many film credits to his name. Besides the film I 
   already mentioned, he was responsible for writing the screenplay to 
   the borefest known as <B><A HREF="cagliostro_1975.htm">CAGLIOSTRO</A></B> 
   (1975) and a romance movie made in 1992, before retiring from the 
   filmmaking business and becoming an author. All-in-all, this is a 
   pretty decent horror film that very few people have even seen. It is 
   a feast for the eyes to those fans of female nudity, contains some 
   bloody deaths for fans of gore and makes a good drinking game if you 
   play &quot;spot the reference&quot; to other better-known American 
   horror films. You'll be blind stinking drunk in the first thirty 
   minutes alone, but there is also some originality here, too. I 
   like&nbsp; how Raffaella becomes a<A HREF="satans_wife_1979.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/satan's wife dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="234" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>

   that Lucifer will be too busy to intervene in the sex, but Lucifer is 
   nothing but a man of his word, always showing up just as Raffaella is 
   about to do the dirty deed, either killing or chasing away the male 
   partner and screwing her himself. It should also be noted that the 
   late <A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_3.htm#StelvioCipriani">Stelvio Cipriani</A> 
   turns in an effective <A HREF="ring_of_darkness_1979.htm#OST">music score</A> 
   here, adding layers of atmosphere to many scenes. Mr. Cipriani is my 
   second favorite composer of Italian genre films, right behind the 
   late Ennio Morricone who, unlike Cipriani, also composed music for 
   many famous non-Italian movies, such as John Carpenter's <B><A HREF="thing_1982.htm">THE
    THING</A></B> (1982) and Brian De Palma's <B><A HREF="untouchables_1987.htm">THE

   for Quentin Tarantino's <B><A HREF="hateful_eight_2015.htm">THE 
   HATEFUL EIGHT</A></B> (2015). Stelvio Cipriani, on the other hand, 
   rarely did music scores for anything besides homegrown Italian films 
   (there are some exceptions, but nothing like Morricone's career) and 
   he has a style that is instantly recognizable to me.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Productions in 1985 (I say &quot;supposedly&quot; because I could 
   find no images of the VHS sleeve to back up IMDb's claim). It

    OF THE DEAD</A><A NAME="RiseOfTheDead2007"></A> (2007) -</B> After 
   Sally Sherman (Brooke Delaney) kills her husband, Sam (Patrick Pope), 
   with an eating utensil for seemingly no reason at all, Laura (Erin 
   Wilk) is attacked while leaving a bar by a man (who moves in 
   herky-jerky blurs, an editing effect I'm growing quite tired of), but 
   Laura's boyfriend, Jack (Stephen Seidel), runs him over with a truck, 
   killing him. How are these two murders connected? The police have a 
   hard time believing Laura and Jack's story, since the man Jack killed 
   was a well-respected lawyer in town. Laura is suddenly haunted by 
   nightmares about the death of a little baby boy (the adopted son of 
   Sally and Sam), who was tragically killed when he grabbed Sam's 
   pistol off the coffee table and shot himself. Laura's roommate, Amber 
   (Jaime Whitlock), is viciously stabbed to death by a stranger who 
   breaks into their house and when Laura comes home with Jack, the 
   stranger attacks Laura, forcing Jack to stab him in the back, killing 
   him (Lucky for Laura that she has Jack around!). It doesn't sit too

    baby that she gave up for adoption, Sheriff Brown grows more 
   suspicious of Laura, but he can't prove anything. Laura goes to stay 
   at her mother's house (with a cop car parked outside for protection), 
   but it's easy to see Laura and her Mom don't get along (Mom is a 
   religious nut who got pregnant with Laura when she was sixteen). When 
   Mom seemingly goes bonkers and tries to kill Laura and Deputy Greer 
   (Executive Producer Chris Ferry; <B><A HREF="tryst_2005.htm">TRYST</A></B> 
   - 2005) with a golf club, Mom is committed to an asylum, the same 
   institute where Sally Sherman is a patient. Sally tells Laura that 
   her dead baby was cursed (yeah, the curse of being born a bastard!) 
   and his ghost is possessing people to kill Laura (This is the first 
   time Laura learns that her baby is dead). Sally also tells Laura that 
   she must find the baby's first adoptive family to learn the truth. 
   Deputy Greer becomes possessed by the baby and is shot dead by 
   Sheriff Brown when he tries to strangle Laura, but when the Sheriff 
   becomes possessed by the baby from Hell immediately after Greer's 
   death, Laura is going to have to find the first adoptive family as 
   quickly as possible. Laura finds them, Barbara and Hank Clemens 
   (Emily Ackerman and Doug Sobon), only to discover that they are so 
   uber-religious, they were deemed to be unfit parents. They cursed the 
   baby as it was taken away from them and it seems the curse stuck. 
   Laura and Jack must find a way to lift the curse and put the baby boy 
   to rest before anyone remotely close to Laura ends up possessed or 
   dead. How Laura does this is one of the worst &quot;What The 
   Fuck?!?&quot; moments I have ever witnessed.&nbsp; This 
   ultra-low-budget horror film (originally filmed on a budget of 
   $20,000 as <B>TANTRUM</B> and also known as <B>GHOST BABY</B>), 
   directed by first-timer William Wedig and scripted by Joshua &amp; 
   Jeffrey Crook (directors/writers of <B><A HREF="salvage_2006.htm">SALVAGE</A></B> 
   [2006], also starring Chris Ferry) and Kris Scotto, has a few 
   effective scenes but is otherwise a pretty laughable affair. 
   Especially funny is the way all those people possessed by the dead 
   baby begin drooling from their mouths and dripping snot from their 
   noses while making &quot;goo-goo&quot; and &quot;ga-ga&quot; noises 
   on the badly overdubbed soundtrack. While there are a few bloody 
   moments (a couple of gory stabbings) and instances of female nudity 
   (including the obligatory shower scene), the premise is so ludicrous, 
   it's hard to take anything seriously, which I doubt was the objective 
   of the filmmakers. By the time we get to the outrageous finale, where 
   Laura makes love to a possessed Jack (thereby fucking her own baby!) 
   in order to plant her baby's seed into her to get pregnant, you'll 
   either be throwing your hands up in the air in disgust or laughing at 
   the ridiculousness of it all. I chose to laugh, because it is obvious 
   that director Wedig and the screenwriters were trying to makle a 
   statement about the insanity of religion (all the religious people in 
   this film are either hypocrites or full-blown nut jobs), but they 
   failed miserably. What they did do was make a 72 minute unintentional 
   comedy about a killer baby ghost. Think about that for a minute. Is a 
   baby even mentally capable to understand the complex mechanizations 
   that is possession? Also starring Vickie Meyers (who died shortly 
   after this film was finished), Matt Regney and Jack Gordon as Cade,

    RITUAL OF DEATH</A><A NAME="RitualOfDeath1990"></A> (1990) -</B> 
   Incomprehensible Brazilian horror film about ancient Indian curses, 
   human sacrifices and gory deaths. After a lecture by a professor on 
   Egyptian and Indian rituals, male student Brad (Olair Coan) follows a 
   sinister looking man (Sergio Hingst), who is wearing a bowler hat and 
   walking with a cane, to the basement of a lecture hall, where he 
   observes a group of Indians performing a human sacrifice on a stone 
   altar. The sinister man tells Brad that he must find &quot;the 
   book&quot;, which the man holds in his deformed, green pus-oozing, 
   hand. The man then disappears, taking the book with him, while Brad 
   is grabbed by the sacrificed man and the Indians before they, too, 
   disappear, leaving Brad by himself in an empty basement. Brad's 
   friend Jim (Michael Kelly) wants to stage a play about how the 
   ancient Egyptians influenced the Indians, but first he and Brad must 
   find a way to steal an old manuscript from an elderly man <A HREF="ritual_of_death_1990.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ritual of death vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="165" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(Serafim
    Gonzalez) in the school's library. Jim sends Brad, his girlfriend 
   Carol (Carina Palatinik) and friend Mickey (Tiao Hoover) to steal the 
   manuscript from the library and they do, but Brad is surprised to 
   learn that it is actually the book that the sinister man was holding 
   in his oozing hands. When Mickey opens the book, we watch as a naked 
   couple make love in a bathtub while rubbing the blood of a 
   decapitated goat's head on their bodies (What The Fuck?!?). During 
   rehearsals for the play, Brad becomes distant to Carol and he refuses 
   to make love to her (Carol retorts, &quot;Go easy, sweetheart! I 
   might just get tired of you!&quot;). Brad begins to act strangely, 
   like eating raw meat in his bedroom of his alcoholic mother's home 
   and worshipping at a makeshift altar that contains candles, a goat's 
   head (again?) and live frogs. When Brad almost strangles a girl 
   during rehearsal in front of the play's sponsors, they pull their 
   sponsorship, which infuriates Jim. Brad begins to have nightmares of 
   the naked couple in the bathtub and of his face breaking out in gooey 
   pustules. The elderly librarian has the police return the stolen book 
   to him, but a now totally possessed Brad (whose skin has broken out 
   in boils and green ooze drips from his mouth) steals the book back 
   again and goes on a murder spree, killing Jim (by drowning him in a 
   bathtub and ripping out his eyes) and a streetwalker who worked as an 
   extra on the play (he stabs her repeatedly in the stomach and then 
   some huge wheel appears out of nowhere and runs her over!). Brad 
   begins murdering everyone involved with the play, while we discover 
   that the sinister man was actually Jim's Uncle Parker, who was once 
   the leader of a cult that practiced human sacrifice before he and his 
   cult were killed. Uncle Parker is using Brad to bring him back to 
   life, while the elderly librarian tries to help Mickey and Carol, the 
   last survivors of the play, to defeat the evil in Brad. Can they do 
   it before it is too late?&nbsp; If you thought the films of Jose 
   Mojica Marins (a.k.a. &quot;Coffin Joe&quot;) were disjointed and 
   confusing, just wait until you take a gander at this train wreck, 
   directed by Fauzi Mansur (<B><A HREF="satanic_attraction_1989.htm">SATANIC
    ATTRACTION</A></B> - 1989) and written by Filipe Grecco and Anthony 
   Roark. While the film is gory as hell, including a knife impalement 
   in the mouth, disembowelments by hammer, a wind machine chopping a 
   guy to pieces after Brad throws acid in his face, a spike driven into 
   a woman's chin, a spear impalement and all of Brad's victims 
   returning to life as zombies, the rest of the film is a bloody mess, 
   as the dubbing and dialogue are simply horrendous (while most of the 
   actors look as though they are speaking English, the actual dubbing 
   sounds like it was recorded inside of a tin can) and the story makes 
   about as much sense as a fever dream. Add to it editing that is 
   downright hectic and acting that can best be described as amateurish 
   (both Leo Robinson as the head police officer and Mara Husemann as 
   Brad's drunk mother are so bad they become mesmerizing in their 
   awfulness) and what you end up with is a film that can best be 
   described as a gorehound's delight, but very little else. It's weird, 
   I'll give it that, but weirdness without purpose loses its appeal 
   mighty fast. Also starring Lillian Ramos, Vanessa Alves, Graca 
   Costas, Ana Flora, Eduardo Panizza, Alfredo Gonzalez, Leticia Vota

   (&quot;I want your hot pussy blood all over my face!&quot;) and sees 
   him lurking in the woods, but no one believes her. Billy then kills

   too). The kills are rather tame and bloodless, consisting of a 
   drowning in a hottub, a steam iron to the throat and a stabbing. The 
   bloodiest part of the film is the concluding concert, where John dons 
   the Death disguise, sings a song (&quot;There's A Killer On The 
   Loose&quot;) and actually disembowels one dancer with a lance and 
   beheads another while the audience screams with delight, thinking 
   it's part of the stage show. Things get surreal when John unmasks 
   himself onstage, handcuffs himself to Lynn and the band plays on as 
   if everything is normal! The only plus is that Tray Loren looks like 
   he's actually singing (he's not) and the band (actually members of 
   Sorcery of <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#StuntRock">STUNT ROCK</A></B> 
   fame) is actually playing live (they are). The songs aren't really 
   that bad if you compare them to the songs in other films of this 
   sub-genre. The film has a non-ending, as it freezes on John's face 
   when he sings the final song (&quot;I'm Back&quot;). Proceed at your 
   own risk. Also starring Renee Hubbard, Tony Rista and Ben Sebastian 
   (I smell nepotism!). Also known as <B><A HREF="rockill_1984.htm">ROCKILL</A></B>.

    It has a novel idea that concerns four convicts, murdered 30 years

   things that no normal person would ever dream of doing in the same

   - 1989), Alex McArthur (<B><A HREF="rampage_1988.htm">RAMPAGE</A></B> 
   - 1988) and Mercedes Colon, take the titled shortcut to make up lost 
   time and run smack dab into the aforementioned dead convicts, one of 
   whom happens to be Phillips' dead father! How's that for 
   coincidences? They are also being chased buy a Russian hitman 
   (Sven-Ole Thorsen of <B><A HREF="running_man_1987.htm">THE RUNNING MAN</A></B>

   years earlier. Every time blood is spilled the dead ones show up to 
   pummel, hack and jackhammer in graphic detail the hapless victims. 
   The whole film seems rather disjointed, like chunks of the screenplay 
   were tossed out the window in favor of action. That would all be fair 
   and good except the action scenes are so lazily shot (with what I 
   call &quot;shaken camera syndrome&quot;) and edited (one wooden crate 
   explodes three times in one gunfight scene!!!) that one wishes that 
   there were a coherent story to go along with this mess. How can you 
   justify the scene of&nbsp; McArthur and Colon making out in their SUV 
   while their charge is hancuffed to a car in the blistering heat? Or 
   how about when Midkiff gets drunk waiting for backup? Professionals 
   would never do this. Williams overacts to the point that you want to

   performance in <B><A HREF="bats_1999.htm">BATS</A></B> - 1999) and 
   Petti, well, let's just say Petti is being Petti. On the plus side, 
   there's the convicts themselves, a frightening concoction of burnt, 
   cracked skin and lethal silent fury. There's also some nice desert 
   scenery, an abandoned drive-in, some decent (if somewhat quick) gore 
   and a strange final scene between Phillips and his dead father. It's 
   also good to see L.Q. Jones back on the screen. He always lends an 
   air of professionalism to everything he's in.&nbsp; One only hopes 
   director Wesley picks a better script (he co-wrote this one) and 
   doesn't wait another 13 years before he makes another movie. It seems 
   he got rusty in between films. Better luck next time. A <A HREF="http://www.lionsgatefilms.com">Lions

   incestuous relationship. The farmer also sells the town psychedelic 
   eggs, laid by a special chicken which cause the eaters to experience 
   acid trips filled with strange visuals (including a mutated chicken 
   hatching from a giant egg). The town is absolutely hooked on the eggs 
   and are surprised when the two couples don't order eggs with their 
   beers when at the bar! Not much of the rest of the films makes much 
   sense as the couples bicker and cheat on each other, two are killed 
   (one of the men smears peanut butter on his dick and has Becky lick 
   it off until it goes too far and she ends up biting it off!), there's 
   a barn full of body parts and the ending makes absolutely no sense.

   one of the producers ran off with the money. He resumed over four 
   years later with the same cast (it's obvious that some of them gained 
   weight and lost some hair) and hasn't been able to get it released 
   until 2004, thanks to Troma, who'll release anything. The DVD case 
   states that the film stars Wings Hauser and Patrick Warburton. Hauser 
   shows up in one scene playing a parody of himself and punches a local 
   punk out when he calls him David Hasselhoff! Warburton shows up in 
   one scene as a patron of the local strip bar. Nobody ever accused 
   Troma of truth in advertising. The presentation of the film is nearly

   (2005) -</B> Teenage miscreant Michelle (Annie Sorell) causes a car 
   accident, which kills her father and sends her to the hospital with 
   severe facial injuries. Dr. Barbary (Angus Scrimm; <B><A HREF="phantasm_1979.htm">PHANTASM</A></B> 
   - 1979) drills a hole in Michelle's head to relieve the pressure when 
   she starts to bleed profusely and he jokingly tells Michelle that in 
   the Dark Ages, doctors performed the same procedure to release evil 
   spirits from possessed peoples' bodies (Michelle then strangely asks, 
   &quot;Are they gone...the spirits?&quot;). Michelle has no 
   recollection of the car accident, but she does see the spirit of her 
   eyeless father at the most inopportune times, as he pleads, &quot;Why 
   did you hurt her and why did you kill me?&quot; Over the next couple 
   of months, Dr. Barbary reconstructs Michelle's face with plastic 
   surgery based on photos from her family album (hospital janitor Cliff 
   [Mike Gaglio] calls her &quot;Bride of Mummy&quot; because of her 
   bandaged face and she seems to scare him more than anything else he 
   has ever seen in this hospital) and when the bandages are finally 
   removed from her face, she is beautiful but she doesn't recognize her 
   face in the mirror. When the Sheriff's Department finally releases 
   her personal effects from the accident, one of the items is an 
   evil-looking ouija board with a satanic-shaped planchette (a 
   five-pointed star), which somehow flashes long-dormant memories into 
   Michelle's mind as soon a<A HREF="satanic_2005.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/satanic dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="206" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>s
    she sees it. Later that night, some gloved figure kills Cliff and 
   steals his keys, which brings Detective Joyner (Jeffrey Combs; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HorrorStar1981">THE
    HORROR STAR</A></B> - 1981) to the hospital to investigate. Since 
   Michelle has no living family, she is sent to Harmony Home, a halfway 
   house for troubled, criminal and orphaned teens run by Mr. Bisson 
   (the late Rick Dean; <B><A HREF="action.htm#RaidersOfTheSun">RAIDERS 
   OF THE SUN</A></B> - 1991; in his final role) and his wife Jackie 
   (Diane Ayala Goldner). Mr. Bisson informs Michelle that she use to be 
   a good girl, but when her mother died of cancer and her father 
   started dating again soon after, she tried to stab her father's new 
   girlfriend with a big-assed knife (Michelle has no recollection of 
   this ever happening). Mr. Bisson allows Michelle to enter her 
   father's house to pick up some personal items and Michelle discovers 
   that her bedroom is decorated with all sorts of black magic items. 
   Mr. Bisson finds a diary in her bedroom that is decorated with the 
   satanic star and he even steals her pot stash! At Harmony House, 
   Michelle meets troubled teens Dutch (Brian Burnett), Larry (Brett 
   Erickson), Dalia (Eliza Swenson) and the uber-religious Jackie, who 
   warns Michelle to stay away from her husband. Mr. Bisson likes to 
   talk about going to strip clubs, sex and is possibly a rapist (He 
   tells his wife, &quot;Remember, they dropped the charges.&quot;). 
   Michelle has more nightmares about her eyeless father (his body is 
   now covered in leeches) and pretty soon a black-hooded figure begins 
   dispatching the residents of Harmony House, making the deaths look 
   like suicide. Larry becomes rightfully concerned and picks up an 
   important clue from Dr. Barbary, while Michelle is chased around by 
   bum Eddie (James Russo), who asks her, &quot;What have you done with 
   Kayla?&quot; The totally not-unexpected finale answers that 
   question.&nbsp; This is standard DTV horror fodder whose punch line 
   can be guessed almost from the opening scene. Director Dan Golden, 
   who showed much promise with his first film, <B><A HREF="naked_obsession_1990.htm">NAKED

    HAUNTED SEA</A></B> (1997), doesn't even try to mask the 
   &quot;surprise&quot; ending in this film. The screenplay, by 
   first-timer Ben Powell, is full of stock, clich&eacute;d characters, 
   including horny, wise-assed teens, a plot we all have seen a hundred 
   times before (including using a ouija board to contact the dead and 
   making Jackie such a drunk, religious nut that Dalia calls her 
   &quot;Ilsa, She Wolf Of The SS&quot; [I'm not a religious person, but 
   portraying the ultra-religious as drunks is quite unfair and common 
   in horror films]) and plot holes you could navigate a cruise ship 
   through (For example: Why didn't Jackie confiscate the ouija board 
   when she removed all of Michelle's other possessions? You would think 
   the God-fearing Jackie would have tossed it in the garbage as soon as 
   she saw the satanic symbols. And why does Michelle decide to take a 
   shower after just discovering the butchered bodies of Mr. Bisson, 
   Jackie and Dutch? How stupid do you think we viewers are?). The only 
   person who registers here is <A HREF="late breaking news.htm#Rick Dean">Rick

   Scrimm, Jeffrey Combs and a cameo by James Russo (<B><A HREF="freeway_1988.htm">FREEWAY</A></B>

   of Maria Aguilar (Marina Hedman), family and staff stand solemnly 
   around her body when it suddenly sits upright, scaring the shit out 
   of her daughter Miria (Jacqueline Dupre). The family doctor, Juan 
   Suarez (Alfonso Gaita), explains to husband Antonio (Aldo Sambrell) 
   that his dead wife's movement was nothing but a muscle spasm, but 
   Antonio (who is a intravenous drug user) believes his wife was trying 
   to tell Miria her secrets. While Antonio is shooting-up in his 
   bedroom, his paraplegic wheelchair-bound mute brother, Ignazio (Joe 
   Davers), is watching housekeeper (and soon-to-be nun) Sol (Mariangela 
   Giordino) masturbate in her bed. When Antonio catches Ignazio getting 
   an eyefull, he takes out his frustrations on Sol instead, berating 
   her for performing such lewd acts. While Miria is lying in her bed, 
   she hears her mother's voice calling her, so she goes down to the 
   crypt in the cavernous basement, where she spots butler Isidro 
   (Giancarlo Del Duca) geeking a chicken and she sees her dead mother's

   her something, but Dr. Suarez wants to put her in a psychiatric 
   hospital instead. Before he is able to do so, Dr. Suarez has a <A HREF="satans_baby_doll_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/satan's baby doll dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>heart
    attack in the crypt when he imagines that Maria (who was once his 
   lover) has come back to life (And just what was the good doctor about 
   to do with that huge hypodermic needle?). The ironfisted Antonio 
   orders Isidro to hide the doctor's body in the castle's vast dungeon 
   crypt and warns Sol to keep her mouth shut. Isidro performs another 
   ritual in the crypt&nbsp; using a mummified corpse, which makes Miria 
   masturbate in her bedroom and then again hear her mother's voice, who 
   orders her to &quot;kill mercilessly&quot; everyone in the castle. 
   Isidro is the first to die when the mummified corpse seemingly comes 
   to life and strangles him while a possessed Miria stares into his 
   eyes. Ignazio is the next to die when he also seemingly gets up from 
   his wheelchair and falls into an open crypt. After Antonio shoots-up 
   again, he imagines making love to Maria, only to realize a short time 
   later that he's making love to his own daughter. He backs away in 
   disgust and falls down a stairwell, killing himself. The last one 
   left is Sol, who goes down to the crypt, lies naked on top of Maria's 
   body and is crushed to death when Maria gives her a dealdy bearhug. 
   With Miria the only person left alive (and the only truly innocent 
   one), Maria can now rest in peace.&nbsp; This sleazy Italian/Spanish

   most of the time with her hands on his penis. While it's clear that 
   there's a lot of dark secrets in the Aguilar family (The question

   offer. The scene where he is wheeling his helpless brother down to 
   the crypt to die is chilling. As the camera, mounted to the bottom of 
   the wheelchair and pointing up, looks into the faces of both Antonio 
   and Ignazio, Antonio calmly and slowly pushes the wheelchair down to 
   the crypt, all the while telling his brother how he is going to die

   film before this, <B><A HREF="remote_control_1987.htm">REMOTE CONTROL</A></B> 
   (1987), Lieberman has always been a director involved in creating 
   some of the most watchable films in the genre. This one is no 
   different. Little Douglas Whooly (Alexander Brickel) is hooked on a 
   video game called Satan's Little Helper, where the onscreen computer 
   character helps Satan by kicking dogs, running over old ladies and 
   generally causing mayhem wherever he goes. Doug is so involved in 
   this game that he dresses up in a Devil's costume for Halloween, the 
   day this story takes place. He, along with his mother (the always 
   welcome and loopy Amanda Plummer), go to meet his collegiate sister 
   Jenna (Katheryn Winnick) who is visiting their island community by 
   ferry. Doug loves his sister and wants to marry her when he grows up 
   (leading to a funny incest remark by Plummer who is talking to a 
   friend on the phone) and especially loves going trick or treating 
   with her. When Jenna shows up with new boyfriend Alex (Stephen 
   Graham) in tow, Doug grows despondent and tries to find a way to get 
   rid of Alex. While walking down the street, Doug sees a serial killer 
   in a Satan costume (it's a great get-up) killing a neighbor and 
   setting the body up as a Halloween decoration. Thinking that the 
   costumed killer is the actual Satan and that all this is play-acting, 
   Doug bonds with the serial killer and they go off on a murder spree. 
   Doug thinks he is Satan's Little Helper and that everything that is 
   happening is fake. Along the way, many mistaken identities are to be 
   had, some funny and some downright dreadful. To give away any more of 
   the plot would be destroying the viewer's enjoyment of this extremely 
   black-humored film. There are a few great setpieces, one concerning a 
   black cat (it's a jolt), another relating to Doug's dad (Wass 
   Stevens) when Doug realizes that this is no joke and another that 
   takes place during an adult Halloween party in a castle (where a 
   reveler can be seen in a mask with worms coming out of it; a small 
   salute to Wormface in <B>SQUIRM</B>). Amanda Plummer really shines in 
   her role as the mother. It's quite remarkable how much she loves her 
   kids and accepts them unconditionally, even when her daughter brings 
   an uninvited guest. It's also commendable that she's open about her 
   pot use and mentions getting stoned on several occasions. She's just 
   generally a nice person who gets caught up in one of the worst days 
   of her life (I'll never look at packing tape the same way again). 
   Though gory in spots, this film relies more on humor and family 
   relationships (including Alex's abusive father, who also happens to 
   live on this island) to get it's point across. There's also a great 
   scene where the serial killer trades his Satan costume for something 
   more appropriate after shooting himself through the palm of his hand. 
   Left wide open for a sequel, let's hope Jeff Lieberman doesn't wait 
   another 17 years before making his next genre film. A Screen Media 
   Films Release. <B>Rated R</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

   Darminah (Diana Suarkom), who shows up late one night, seemingly out 
   of nowhere. It soon becomes apparent that Ms. Darminah is the 
   housekeeper from Hell, as she begins controlling the Munarto 
   household, especially Tommy, who has a nightmare in which Ms. 
   Darminah and some rubber mask-wearing Satanists sacrifice him on an 
   altar. As the bodies begin piling up, a white witch doctor is called 
   in to perform an exorcism on the Munarto home, but Ms. Darminah's 
   black powers prove to be too strong. When the bodies of the recently

   has a much stronger religious subtext, too. That's not to say that 
   this film is boring, because it's not. It's just that it lacks the 
   non-stop weirdness that we've come to expect from films of this type. <B>SATAN'S

   nocturnal visit Mom pays to Tommy; a visit to a morgue, where Rita 
   must identify the body of her boyfriend Herman, who was killed in a 
   motorcycle accident caused by Ms. Darminah; Tommy's nightmare of 
   being sacrificed; the undead Herman (who, for some reason, is now a

   opening, we see a woman's dismembered head lying in the middle of her 
   dismembered hands and feet directly under the Hollywood sign), 
   leaving the police baffled as to the killer's motive. We then watch 
   the killer&nbsp; (he wears an overcoat, a big-rimmed fedora and 
   sunglasses to hide his face) following a middle-age bar floozy home, 
   where he hits her over the head with a lead pipe and then begins 
   dismembering her body with an electric carving knife, part of his 
   killing kit that he carries with him in a backpack. When the poor 
   woman wakes up (while he's cutting off her hand!), the killer 
   finishes her off with a meat cleaver. We then switch to drifter Vic 
   (John David Garfield; <B><A HREF="stepmother_1972.htm">THE STEPMOTHER</A></B> 
   - 1972) hitching a ride on the back of a Movieland Tour bus (the bus 
   driver is short-lived Three Stooges member Joe Besser). He jumps off 
   at the mansion of aging alcoholic ex-movie star Katherine Parker 
   (Miriam Hopkins; <B><A HREF="dr_jekyll_and_mr_hyde_1931.htm">DR. 
   JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE</A></B> - 1931), who has just broken her leg 
   after taking a drunken stumble down her mansion's spiral staircase. 
   Vic immediately ingratiates himself into the Parker household, 
   including maid Mildred (Florence Lake), whom he introduces himself to 
   as &quot;Laurel N. Hardy&quot; (!), and Miss Parker's stern manager 
   Leslie (Gale Sondergaard; <B><A HREF="black_cat_1941.htm">THE BLACK CAT</A></B> 
   - 1941), who begrudgingly gives him a job as Miss Parker's nursemaid. 
   Vic soon becomes Miss Parker's closest confidant, much to the dismay 
   of Leslie and the rest of the staff, who have been with her for years 
   but have never been treated as well as she treats Vic. When it's 
   revealed that Vic's a habitual drug abuser and has frequent 
   flashbacks about his childhood, where he watches his mother willingly 
   being gang-banged by four sweaty men before she has her hand 
   chopped-off by someone swinging a hatchet, it becomes quite 
   reasonable for the viewer to assume that Vic is the serial killer on 
   the loose. Miss Parker's cook, Greta (Virginia Wing), becomes 
   pregnant by Vic, only to end up chopped into little pieces by someone 
   wielding a meat cleaver. It turns out, as no surprise, that Vic is 
   quite mad, and when Miss Parker grows suspicious of his motivations, 
   he kills her, replaces her with a mannequin and takes over the 
   mansion, not allowing anyone to talk to or visit &quot;Miss 
   Parker&quot;. As the rest of the staff also grow suspicious, Vic 
   kills th<A HREF="savage_intruder_1968.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/savage intruder vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="250" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>em
    one-by-one until he is left alone in the mansion, where he is able 
   to relive and reboot his childhood. Only this time, he's in 
   control.&nbsp; This swinging 60's horror film, full of hippie 
   dialogue, fashions and freak-out sequences, not to mention some 
   surprisingly graphic bits of gore (all with that bright, almost neon, 
   red blood that that era was so fond of), is a good time capsule of 
   when horror films actually told a coherent (if freaky) story to go 
   along with the scares. Triple threat director/producer/scripter 
   Donald Wolfe (who never directed another film, although he was an 
   editor on such films as <B><A HREF="human_duplicators_1965.htm">THE 
   HUMAN DUPLICATORS</A></B> [1965]) offers a fascinating glimpse of two 
   distinctly different lifestyles facing each other head-on: The Old 
   Guard, represented by Katherine Parker, who still dreams of making a 
   comeback film (she sometimes drunkenly hallucinates about it, which 
   leads to her broken leg), not knowing that her career is nothing but 
   a footnote to most people (At one party thrown at her house by Vic, a 
   midget offers her cocaine [She replies, &quot;The only trips I go on 
   are the nostalgic kind!&quot;] and a young woman sarcastically asks 
   her if she appeared in <B><A HREF="bride_of_frankenstein_1935.htm">THE
    BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN</A></B>); and the New Guard, represented by 
   Vic, who believes sex, drugs and taking advantage of an old woman's 
   weaknesses is all he needs to survive. Miriam Hopkins (this is her 
   last film; she passed away in 1972 of a heart attack) is terrific as 
   Miss Parker, who relives her past successes with a combination of 
   alcohol and watching her old films in a screening room in her mansion 
   (using actual footage of some of Miriam Hopkins' old films). She even 
   does a brief topless scene! John David Garfield (the son of actor 
   John Garfield) is equally as good as the murderous, opportunistic 
   Vic, who has yet to meet anyone he can't deceive or murder when his 
   fragile psyche is exposed. The supporting cast of film veterans also 
   raises this film a notch or two above the norm and help move this 
   film to it's graphic conclusion. I was pleasantly surprised how much 
   I liked this film, especially since it is steeped in drug and alcohol 
   abuse and yet turns out to be a sobering experience. Also starring

   refuses to go into the house and walks off into the forest (In a real 
   asshole move, boyfriend Tony doesn't go after her, explaining to his 
   friends that this is nothing but &quot;foreplay&quot;! Double 
   What?!?), while the rest of them break into the houseand take a tour. 
   They naturally decide to check out the basement first (Triple 
   What?!?) and find two coffins, one marked &quot;Alfred&quot; and the 
   other marked &quot;Amanda&quot;. Tony loses his ring trying to open 
   one of the coffins (Quadruple What?!?) and then everyone hears the 
   destroyed limo's horn honk outside. Tony finally decides to go find 
   Helen, but it's too late, as someone has slit her throat and is 
   dragging her corpse through the forest (Tony's not getting any 
   foreplay tonight!). Jack and the rest of the group, which also 
   includes Susan (Liz Hitchler) and Anne (Kathleen Patane), decide to 
   check out the house further and find that the whole house is 
   plastered with photos of the same woman found in the back seat of the 
   limo (We also discover that Jack is wanted by the police, but we 
   don't know what his crime is). Tony returns to the house empty-handed 
   (Peter makes a crass joke about Helen using her ample assets as a 
   hitch-hiker, while everyone else roasts wieners in the fireplace. 
   Quintuple What?!?) and Susan notices a crack in the only wall without 
   photos that seems to be getting bigger. When they discover a closet 
   full of pickled human scalps, you would think that they would make a 
   hasty retreat, right? Well, think again. They decide to stay until 
   morning because it is raining outside! It's not long before all these 
   stupid, stupid motherfuckers get just what they deserve, as Alfred 
   (William Russell), the facially-scarred husband of the ill-fated (and 
   badly burned) Amanda (Jennifer Delora; <B><A HREF="bad_girls_dormitory_1986.htm">BAD
    GIRLS DORMITORY</A></B> - 1986), the chick in all the photos, begin 
   killing them in various bloody ways. Finally, a man and a woman with 
   common sense!&nbsp; I could write a book describing all the idiotic 
   and bone-headed things these poor excuses for human beings do and 
   say, but then I would be depriving you of a once-in-a-lifetime 
   experience of pure inanity. With friends like these, who needs 
   enemies? I wish I could say this is all because of 
   director/screenwriter Jose Ramon Larraz's lack of command of the 
   English language, but he's been making English language films since 
   the early 70's (<B><A HREF="whirlpool_1970.htm">WHIRLPOOL</A></B> - 
   1970; <B><A HREF="vampyres_1974.htm">VAMPYRES</A></B> - 1974), so I 
   would like to believe this was his way of goofing-on or fucking-with 
   the audience. These kids live in some alternate universe, where it is 
   normal to sit in a wrecked limousine and smoke a cigarette or open a 
   sealed casket to see if there's a body inside (C'mon, everyone's 
   doing it!). Thankfully, Larraz offers us plenty of nudity (including 
   disturbing naked photos of Alfred and Amanda's victims, both male and 
   female, that he keeps in an album) and some graphic bloodletting in 
   the final third of the film. The reveal of what's behind the cracked 
   wall is also quite graphic and well-photographed. <B>SAVAGE LUST</B>

    WATER</A><A NAME="SavageWater"></A> (1979) -</B> Here's an obscure, 
   bad slasher flick that takes place during a white water rafting trip 
   (filmed on location in Moab, Utah and Grand Canyon National Park in 
   Arizona). It's also guaranteed to put your ass to sleep. A group of 
   diverse, stereotypical people, including Doc Rogers (Ron Berger), a 
   psychiatrist; a widowed father and his snotty son; a elderly German 
   couple (the German guy tells the snotty kid, after the kid calls him 
   a Kraut: &quot;Adolph Hitler ist dead und some day you vill be 
   too!&quot;); a Arab s<A HREF="savage_water_1979.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/savage water british vhs front small2.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="126" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>heik;
    a couple of sexy female teenagers; a husband and wife (the wife is 
   deathly afraid to eat in the dark!); and an overweight junk food 
   fanatic in a Gilligan hat, head down the Colorado River in three 
   rubber rafts with their tour guides. After being lectured by the tour 
   guides about the horrors of littering (What, no crying Indian?) and 
   what wild plants not to eat (apparently eating belladonna will make 
   your heart race so fast, it will explode), our motley group get their 
   first taste of the rapids and camp out for the night on the banks of 
   the river. One of the sexy teenagers hits on the Arab sheik and he 
   proposes marriage (&quot;Will you be my American wife?&quot;), while 
   the tour guides smoke pot. After an unreasonably long stretch of 
   useless hijinks and constant in-fighting, someone pushes one of the 
   tourists off a cliff after he snorts some coke. Thinking he was high, 
   lost his balance and slipped, the tour guides simply bury him and 
   continue with the trip (!), not aware that someone in their group is 
   actually a cold-blooded killer. After the snotty boy is bitten by a 
   rattlesnake (the killer purposely put it in the boy's sleeping bag) 
   and one of the tour guides ends up dead, the idiotic tour group still 
   continues on their trip, even though their radio to contact the 
   outside is out of commission. Yes, these people deserve entry into 
   the &quot;Idiots Hall Of Fame&quot; and deserve everything that is 
   about to happen to them. One of the sexy teenagers is stabbed to 
   death in the back with a hunting knife and another woman is poisoned 
   with belladonna. Everyone finally wises-up, but they try to hang Doc 
   Rogers when they mistakenly believe he is the killer. Tour leader 
   Dave (Gill Van Wagoner) saves him from the noose, but while rafting 
   back to civilization, Dave is forced to kill him with the spinning 
   propellers of one of the raft's outboard motors, even though to his 
   dying breath, Doc professes his innocence. Back in civilization, the 
   surviving tourists and crew are found innocent of culpability in a 
   civil trial, but the epilogue reveals the identity of the real 
   killer. It's no surprise. This is an embarrassingly dull 
   mystery/horror film that's sub-par on every level. The acting by a 
   cast of regional non-pros<A HREF="savage_water_1979.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/savage water french vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="132" HEIGHT="195" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   is especially excruciating to watch, as everyone flubs or steps on 
   lines constantly (Rasheed Javeri as the Arab sheik Mahomed is about 
   as bad as they come). It wouldn't be so bad if there were a little 
   action to go along with the constant yapping, but 95% of the film is 
   nothing but incessant, inane dialogue spoken by people who couldn't 
   order a Happy Meal without needing a second take. Director/ producer/ 
   editor/ photographer/raft inflator Paul W. Kener (whose only other 
   contribution to cinema is the harder-to-find horror abomination <B><A HREF="#Wendigo1978">WENDIGO</A></B> 
   [1978]) forgot the cardinal rule of successful horror filmmaking: Put 
   some fucking scares and blood into the damn film! Instead, he offers 
   endless shots of people walking, talking and doing trivial things, 
   like eating, waiting to go to the bathroom or acting like total 
   idiots. Kener even manages to make white water rafting seem ho-hum, 
   as the majority of the film takes place on dry land. The film isn't 
   even good enough for an unintentional laugh, as most of the killings 
   take place off-screen, there's no nudity (the film's idea of 
   skinny-dipping is everyone jumping in the river with their underwear 
   on) and the pacing is stagnant (the screenplay was written by Kipp 
   Boden, his only film credit). I swore I actually saw the hands of my 
   watch move counter-clockwise while viewing this. <B>SAVAGE WATER</B> 
   is a loooong 95 minute viewing experience and makes director Byron 
   Quisenberry's similarly-themed <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Scream 1981">SCREAM</A></B> 
   (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="#Scream 1981">THE OUTING</A></B> - 1981) seem 
   like a masterpiece of suspense. Watching this film proves that some 
   hard-to-find films deserve to be that way. The bad title tune was 
   written and warbled (badly) by co-star Doug Warr. Also starring 
   Bridget Agnew, Mike Wactor, Gene Eubanks, Steven Evans, Dirk 
   Strickwerda, Clayton King, Pat Comer, Dawn DeAnne, Valerie Kittel and 
   Doug Jones as Dean, the snotty boy. This has never been available on 
   home video in the U.S., which only proves that we here in the States 
   still have a modicum of pride. The print I viewed was sourced from a 
   British VHS tape, proving once again that they will do anything to 
   shame us. <B>Not Rated</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

    WEEKEND</A><A NAME="Savage Weekend"></A> (1976) -</B> Another unsung 
   gem from the 70's that, when it is mentioned in reference books, is 
   usually maligned or unfairly labeled a &quot;bomb&quot;. While the 
   film is partly a stalk 'n' slash tale, it's quite refreshing in it's 
   delivery, as there are no teenagers and very few children in sight, 
   just adults acting like adults. A group of friends (each one with 
   personal problems of their own) head to a house in Upstate New York 
   for some business and fun. In the film's funniest scene, openly-gay 
   Nicky (Christopher Allport of <B><A HREF="jack_frost_1996.htm">JACK FROST</A></B> 
   - 1996) stops at a bar for a drink and ends up beating the shit out 
   of two brawny men making fun of his sexuality (and the extremely 
   short swim trunks he is wearing). Once they reach the house, they 
   find a dead bat nailed to the door (only Nicky is man enough to 
   remove it). After a few <B><A HREF="big_chill.htm">BIG CHILL</A></B>-like
    moments, where Mac Macauley (<B><A HREF="reanimator_1985b.htm">RE-ANIMATOR</A></B>'s

   watches nearby (and ogles the naked man) and they all watch Otis kill 
   a renegade rat, a masked killer begins to kill them one-by-one for 
   some unknown reason. Could it be Otis, who rides a bike and spends 
   too much time in a graveyard talking to the headstone of his dead 
   friend? Or Mac, who gets his rocks off by telling scary stories to 
   everyone? Or could it be someone in the house? Since they all seem to 
   have one problem or another, from jealousy, child custody trouble, 
   sexual abuse to sexual identity, it is a definite possibility. As the 
   story progresses, the group have a fancy dress dinner party and the 
   killing begins. Jay (Devin Goldenberg) is hung in the barn and 
   another is done in with a hatpin to the ear. A table saw is used to 
   kill another, in the film's most suspenseful scene. A baling hook and 
   impalement are used to kill another before the killer is unmasked and 
   his motivations revealed. It all ends in a final showdown (a chainsaw 
   and a machete are involved), where an unlikely character becomes the 
   savior.&nbsp; This is one of my favorite 70's horror films. It's 
   mature in it's approach to love and death, something you don't 
   normally see in low-budget horror films. Director/producer/scripter 
   David Paulsen (<B><A HREF="schizoid_1980.htm">SCHIZOID</A></B> - 
   1980) doesn't tip his hand that there's a killer on the loose until 
   about the 45 minute mark (where we see the masked killer trying on 
   one of the guest's clothes). Up until then, we see plenty of full 
   frontal nudity (both male and female), the Otis flashback where he 
   brands the woman and smashes her lover's head against a rock (this 
   flashback may not be true, since Mac, who is telling it, does not 
   like Otis to begin with), a cringe-inducing scene where Mac removes a 
   fishing hook from a guy's foot and various sexual infidelities 
   amongst the cast. What really is different about this film is the way 
   it portrays the gay character. Nicky is not portrayed as a 
   limp-wristed girly-man, but as a strong person capable of taking care 
   of himself and others, a rarity in 70's cinema. The killer's 
   motivation is not much of a surprise (it's basically revealed in the 
   opening minutes), but the tense final minutes, coupled with a creepy 
   banjo score, really toss you for a loop. The acting is uniformly good 
   (most of the cast went on to have long careers, many of them in the 
   horror genre) and the gore, while sparse, is well-handled. The only 
   minus is the pesky boom mike makes several appearances at the top of 
   the screen, but that could be a framing issue on the print I viewed.

   about people with the ability to control and reshape other peoples'

   After Hewlett figures out Ponton's plans for the city, then the

   apartment at a Christmas party. Alex's mild-mannered scanner sister 
   Helena (the sexy Liliana Komorowska) suffers severe headaches and 
   decides to use an experimental drug called EPH-3, invented by their 
   adoptive father (Daniel Pilon). The drug is a patch which is worn on 
   the back of the neck, and soon Helena starts going stark raving mad. 
   She telekinetically explodes a pidgeon for taking a dump on her hand. 
   She kills a doctor (head explosion) who runs a clinic for scanners 
   and takes control of the Scanner population. When she discovers that 
   her powers can be transmitted over the airwaves, she comes up with a 
   plan for world domination. She kills her adoptive father and send a 
   scanner over to Thailand to kill her brother so she can inherit her 
   father's giant pharmaceutical business. Alex escapes, but can he save 
   the world? This film is jam-packed with violent action and stunts. 
   Beside the prerequisite head explosions, there's finger explosions, 
   body parts shot off, kung fu fights, car chases and various bodies in 
   stages of scanning deformity. Director Christian Duguay (who filmed 
   this one back-to-back with Part 2) injects a healthy dose of humor

    OF THE CLASS</A></B> [1986 - 1990]), a trans-neural researcher who

   problem on his hands: He is being hunted by Carl Volkin (Patrick

   - 1990), an escaped convict and scanner who Staziak put away five 
   years ago after subduing him and killing his brother in a botched 
   robbery attempt. Volkin has discovered a way to increase his scanning 
   powers by sucking the life force out of other scanners, leaving his 
   victims nothing but burnt, shriveled-up shells of their former 
   selves. Since Staziak is a much stronger scanner, Volkin must locate 
   other scanners to increase his powers before he can confront his 
   nemesis face-to-face. He breaks into Carrie's office to get her 
   client list of scanner patients. When she catches him in the act (and 
   dials 911), Volkin attempts to perform his talents on her. The police 
   break in and distract Volkin. He dispatches the cops and leaves 
   Carrie in a coma. The only information Volkin was able to obtain was 
   Staziak's home address, so he breaks into the house and tries to take 
   Staziak out using conventional means, namely a shotgun. Staziak is 
   too smart for him and foils the attempt. They get into a scanning 
   contest where Staziak proves to be the strongest. Volkin escapes in 
   the nick of time and searches the streets for scanners to kill. He 
   finds a few, which does increase his powers, but still not enough to 
   defeat Staziak. He breaks into Carrie's office again and this time is 
   able to get her client list. He then goes on a scanner killing spree, 
   a delirious section of the film which is a showcase of imaginative 
   and wickedly gross special effects. Volkin has now gained enough 
   strength to take Staziak on, but first he wants to make him suffer. 
   He attempts to kill Staziak's scanner mother, but she senses his 
   presence and kills herself by jumping out a window so that her power 
   will not be passed on to Volkin. Staziak, who arrives too late to 
   save his mother, now knows that he is not strong enough to beat 
   Volkin just by using his powers alone. He resorts to the art of 
   illusion in a final battle that ends with a nifty head explosion (a 
   staple in this series). Director Steve Barnett, who also made the 
   Fangoria horror film <B><A HREF="mindwarp_1990.htm">MINDWARP</A></B> 
   (1990) and the excellent action feature <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#Mission Of Justice">MISSION
    OF JUSTICE</A></B> (1992), imbues this film with a sense of 
   foreboding and doom. He also injects some very dry humor into the 
   proceedings. Daniel Quinn and Patrick Kilpatrick make for a grand 
   battling duo and, when they go into their scanning routines, make it 
   look downright painful. More than once I found myself digging my 
   fingernails into my palms from the tension onscreen. Isn't that the 
   whole point in watching horror films? This is the last film in the 
   series. They should make more. Also starring Robert Forster, Stephen

   Wilfred Manz, a possible ex-Nazi who tries to raise an ancient spirit 
   called Khepera, who uses scarab beetles as it's calling card. After 
   unsuccessfully trying to summon Khepera in his laboratory (He has a 
   scarab beetle, which is sitting atop a miniature pyramid surrounded

   raising the spirit), crazy Dr. Manz cuts his hand in anger and

   appears and possesses the Professor's body, eventually turning him 
   into a cult leader who swears to his many followers (the male members 
   look like masked Mexican wrestlers and the female members walk around

   only thing they have in common with each other is that a tiny scarab

    press conference, begins following a nurse named Elena (Cristina 
   Hachuel) when he notices her stealing the scarab from the dead 
   politician's body. Elena, who has mystical powers (including the 
   power to heal, as we watch her miraculously cure a serious head wound 
   of one of her patients), may just be what the world needs to combat 
   the possessed Dr. Manz. As Murphy ingratiates himself into her life, 
   he also does some research into Khempera and discovers some 
   disturbing facts. Meanwhile, the possessed Dr. Manz hangs out with 
   some topless female followers in his temple, but every time he tries 
   to make love to them, something awful happens, such as one girl's 
   body morphing into that of a jackass (!) or another girl instantly 
   becoming covered in boils and exploding (What the hell?). Murphy has 
   multiple attempts made on his life and discovers that Elena is 
   actually Dr. Manz's daughter. Together, they try to find her father 
   and end the madness. By the time they reach that juncture in the 
   film, you will either be sound asleep or wishing that you were.&nbsp; 
   This boring horror film, directed and co-written by Steven-Charles 
   Jaffe (better known for scripting and producing <B><A HREF="motel_hell_1980.htm">MOTEL

   [1989]), is really a mess of a film. The story is confusing, 
   especially since portions of the film are spoken in Spanish without 
   the benefit of English subtitles, and Robert Ginty sleepwalks 
   throughout the entire film, making his character more unlikable than 
   Khepera, something I'm sure scripters Jaffe, his brother Robert 
   Jaffe, Ned Miller and Jim Block didn't count on. It's also hard to 
   understand why an accomplished, award-winning actor like Rip Torn 
   would take such a demeaning role as he did here, unless he needed 
   some quick booze money (Torn has a reputation for being a notorious 
   alcoholic) or just wanted to bang some topless starlets. It's pretty 
   embarrassing watching him literally spitting out his line here (I'm 
   not kidding. In some scenes you can actually see drool on his chin or 
   spraying spittle as he barks out his lines). Jaffe's idea of 
   atmosphere is to bathe every scene in fog (the fog machines are 
   working overtime here) and although there is some gore, it's nothing 
   to write home about. Everything about <B><A HREF="scarab_1982b.htm">SCARAB</A></B> 
   just seems wrong-headed and ill advised. I'm still trying to figure 
   out why Ginty ignorantly walks down a busy street listening to his 
   walkman, oblivious to the fact that someone is trying to kill him, 
   even though he can plainly see objects and people blowing up in front 
   of him. Ginty acts like it's a normal, everyday occurrence and 
   doesn't wise-up until a piece of shrapnel hits him in the face. I 
   guess that pretty much wraps-up how I feel about this film: It's 
   clueless to the point of being stupid and I'm not talking about the 
   good stupid, either. Also starring Isabel Garcia Lorca, Donald 
   Pickering, Sam Chew Jr., Jose Luis de Vilallonga, Hector Alterio,

   (2008) -</B> More cannibal/torture nonsense; this one taking place at 
   a hillbilly town somewhere in Pennsylvania (actually filmed in 
   Ontario, Canada during one of the harshest winters on record). The 
   film shows a twilight of promise in the opening scene, as a totally 
   nude and blood-covered skeletal-looking man tries to outrun whomever 
   is chasing him (the chase is intercut with someone playing around 
   with some bloody Rube Goldberg-esque torture devices while eating a 
   bloody bowl of <I>something</I> with a spoon), only to be captured

   (Thomas Webb) and Owen (co-director/co-producer/co-writer John 
   Geddes), are on their last day of vacation and hit the party circuit 
   looking to score with some chicks (Nice that they waited until their 
   last day of vacation to do so. They give all guys from New Jersey,

   the headlights) until he passes-out from doing too many shots. The 
   next morning, a hungover Dustin, Owen and Trevor

   for the long trip back to Jersey (If yesterday was their last day of

   (1972), our Jersey trio get directions to the highway by a fat guy 
   with a broken neck at the diner's counter (he uses a small hand 
   mirror to see behind him). Being the trusting idiots that they are, 
   they follows the guy's directions and end up in the middle of 
   nowhere, crashing their car and Trevor breaking his leg. While Trevor 
   waits in the car, Dustin and Owen head out in the middle of a 
   snowstorm (Did I mention that they were idiots?) and find a 
   strange-looking cabin hidden in the woods (As with most of these DTV 
   horror flicks, there is no cellphone service and the cabin has no 
   phone). They meet creepy cabin owner Ivan (Steve Warren), who drives 
   them back to their car, only to find Trevor missing and tracks in the 
   snow indicate that he was carried-off by someone (Like we all didn't 
   see that coming!). Ivan tells the guys that Trevor was probably 
   rescued by neighbor Wade (Gary Fischer) and he offers to drive them 
   there the next morning once the snow stops. Rather that running off 
   like scared rabbits, Dustin and Owen decide they have no choice but 
   to spend the night with Ivan, eating his special brand of 
   &quot;meat&quot; and drinking his moonshine. I think we can all see 
   where this is heading: A non-stop barrage of torture and cannibalism, 
   followed by a fatalistic finale where the good guys don't stand a 
   snowball's chance in Hell of making it out alive no matter how hard 
   they fight back. In other words, a typical ending when the writers 
   can't come up with a decent ending, so they kill off the good guys (a 
   plot device used in way too many modern DTV horror films).&nbsp; This 
   is the first feature film from

   films were made after this one, but I'm an anal completist!). The 
   first forty minutes are spent getting to know Dustin, Owen and Trevor 
   and the remainder of the film is spent watching Ivan and Wade torture 
   the trio, stripping away their flesh and cooking them. I don't know 
   about you, but all this cannibalism nonsense in horror films is 
   becoming cliched and old hat, no matter how bloody and gory this film 
   is. And gory this film is, with bodies being gutted; arms, legs and 
   heads being cut off; bones exposed; and all the torture devices, 
   including metal body cages, teeth and toenail removal by pliers, 
   mouth gags and arm and leg restraints. The apex of clichedom comes 
   when we learn that Dustin is a vegetarian, so you know the cannibals

   When Eric and Steve were young boys, they were constantly abused by 
   their teacher, Mr. George Andersson (Johnny Harborg). One such 
   incident has Mr. Andersson catching Eric and Steve smoking 
   cigarettes, so he slaps Eric Hard across his face and puts out a 
   cigarette on Steve's palm before giving them detention. The boys have 
   had enough of his abuse, so they attempt to teach him a little lesson 
   by playing a practical joke on him by throwing firecrackers under his 
   reading chair in his home, but it goes horribly wrong and Mr. 
   Andersson catches fire and burns to death. Eric and Steve were never 
   blamed for the death and Steve moved to America shortly thereafter. 
   Twenty years pass and Eric (Martin Brandqvist) is a complete mess. He 
   believes Mr. Andersson has returned from the grave and is haunting 
   him, <A HREF="scorched_heat_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/scorched heat swedish vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="185" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>so
    he writes a letter to Steve (Harald Treutiger), who is now a 
   successful music producer, begging him to come back to Sweden to help 
   him fight the demon. Steve flies to Sweden with his bitchy wife Linda 
   (Babs Brinklund) and the first thing they do is head to Eric's house, 
   which they find a ramshackled mess. A crazed Eric tries to strangle 
   Steve, but Linda beans Eric over the head with a wine bottle, which 
   seems to knock some sense into him. While Linda takes a bath in 
   Eric's upstairs bathroom, Eric and Steve talk about the bad old days, 
   when all of a sudden Linda screams and disappears from the bathroom. 
   Steve and Eric find her unconscious in the attic, where she pukes-up 
   maggots and Mr. Andersson's burned arm bursts out of her mouth. Eric 
   tells Steve that they're all illusions performed by the vengeful 
   ghost of Mr. Andersson and if they don't want the illusions to turn 
   deadly, no one should leave the house. That's not such a wise move. 
   Mr. Andersson turns out to be much more crueler dead than he was 
   alive and when Linda finds out the truth of how Mr. Andersson became 
   a ghost (She callously says, &quot;Don't bother to tell me that I'm 
   married to a killer!&quot;), she gets the bright idea to blow up the 
   cellar of Mr. Andersson's burned-out home (luckily, Eric has a case 
   of TNT hanging around in his living room!). They decide to blow-up 
   the cellar the next morning, but this night is going to be a rough 
   one, as the ghostly Mr. Andersson tries every illusion in the book to 
   get the trio to kill each other. They manage to make it through the 
   night after a close call with a burglar (co-scripter Johan A. 
   Dernelius) and a police officer (co-scripter Anders Jonsson) and then 
   drive to Mr. Andersson's home, only to be taken hostage by a street 
   gang that is squatting there. They manage to scare off the gang and 
   locate the cellar. They plant the dynamite, only to discover that the 
   entire house has reappeared. They quickly forget that everything is 
   an illusion and it leads to one of the trio being killed by the hands 
   of the other two. Stupid Swedes, duped by a ghost! Take 'em away 
   boys!&nbsp; This wacky Swedish horror film (all the actors speak 
   their own fractured versions of English), directed and co-written by 
   Peter Borg (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#SoundsOfSilence1989">SOUNDS OF SILENCE</A></B> 
   - 1989), is one of those movies where having a good tolerance level 
   (for Swedish accents, fragmented dialogue, cheesy special effects) is 
   a must. If you find you can get through some of the film's hoarier 
   moments (which is practically the entire first 45 minutes), you may 
   find yourself having a good time here. Half the fun is listening to 
   the actors speak their lines in Swenglish, especially the gang of 
   thugs who occupy the remains of Mr. Andersson's home (<B>Gang Leader:</B>

   of any substantial blood and gore (the worse it gets is the maggot

   church was harboring a deadly secret since 1871; a multi-tentacled 
   creature that escapes and hides in the body of a fireman (it enters 
   through his navel), who then transfers the creature to Scott's 
   cheating girlfriend, Lydia (Marina Pasqua). Scott has had his doubts 
   about Lydia's faithfulness, so he follows her one night and catches 
   her cheating with some guy in the ladies room of a nightclub. Too bad 
   for Scott, as Lydia has already transferred the creature into her new 
   lover's body and she d<A HREF="scourge_2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/scourge dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="188" HEIGHT="267" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ies
    (bloodily) in Scott's arms. Sheriff Durst (Russ Ferrier), Jesse's 
   uncle, has a hard-on for Scott and wants him arrested in connection 
   with Lydia's death. Jesse, who is fighting some personal demons of 
   her own, helps Scott, much to her Uncle's displeasure, while Scott 
   tries to discover exactly what killed Lydia. It leads him to the 
   firehouse and then the church, where Scott discovers the truth behind 
   the ancient evil. Meanwhile, the guy Lydia infected goes berserk in a 
   shopping mall, forcing Deputy Sam (Jason Harder) and Sheriff Durst to 
   shoot him dead. While transporting the body in an ambulance, the 
   creature enters the body of a skateboarding paramedic (!). The 
   creature infects several more people, while Scott tries to track it 
   down and Jesse looks for clues to the creature's origins in the 
   church's records. Jesse finds the great-granddaughter of an 1871 
   victim that was locked in the church's catacombs and she tells Jesse 
   the whole sordid story. Apparently, only huge electrical shocks (like 
   a lightning strike or being stunned with a taser) or alcohol will 
   keep the creature at bay. When Scott is arrested by the Sheriff, who, 
   it turns out, is infected with the creature, Jesse has to find a way 
   to save Scott and kill the creature in her Uncle. The appearance of a 
   one-eyed church official comes in the nick of time, as a broken lamp, 
   a vat of wine and a very hot fire kills the creature for good. Or 
   does it?&nbsp; Although the film starts out interestingly enough, it 
   quickly deteriorates thanks to amateur acting, crappy CGI effects and 
   a story that makes very little sense (It plays like a sub-par version 
   of <B><A HREF="hidden_1987.htm">THE HIDDEN</A></B> [1987]).

   who refuses to believe that anyone but Scott could be responsible for 
   the murders (no matter how fucked-up the corpses look); the 
   incredible coincidence where Scott is locked in the same cell as the 
   latest infected victim (who also informs Scott that the Sheriff is 
   corrupt and is responsible for setting up Scott's first two-year 
   stint in prison!); to the way police and firefighters don't act 
   slightly concerned how the Sheriff, now burned to a crisp, can 
   suddenly bolt up and infect the town's overweight newspaper reporter 
   (by attaching his lips to the reporter's navel!). Add to that the 
   side effects of being infected includes overeating and constant 
   burping and farting and what you have is a film so devoid of 
   originality or suspense, you'll want to beat yourself over the head 
   with a pipe for comfort, especially after watching Jesse's lame 
   attempt at seducing the fat reporter. It's painful, just like 
   watching the rest of the film. Besides a few moments of gore 
   (including an obvious CGI shot of a man losing his lower jaw), 
   there's nothing to recommend here. Hell, there's not even any nudity!

   (1981) -</B> No, this is not the Wes Craven film of the same name. 
   This is a bland slasher flick where you have to guess the killer's 
   identity (unlike Craven's film, the identity of the killer in this 
   one is a cheat). A group of investors are rafted down the Rio Grande 
   to a site where a ghost town resides. They are there to size up the 
   area in hopes of turning it into a vacation resort. The very first 
   night there, the <A HREF="scream_1981c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/scream 1981 vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="112" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>killing
    begins (offscreen). The group become suspicious of each other as the 
   unseen killer hangs, knifes and meat cleavers members of the group 
   one-by-one (again offscreen). As daylight comes, they find their 
   rafts missing and they are 30 miles away from the nearest 
   civilization. Since their leader was one of the first ones killed, 
   the group decides to stay at the ghost town and wait for a rescue 
   team since no one knows the way back. No one said they were smart. 
   When two lost offroad cyclists stumble into town, one of the group 
   borrows a motorcycle and goes off for help. Will he get back before 
   everyone is systematically murdered? Will your eyes close before the 
   film ends? Will I ever stop watching crap like this? Here's my 
   problem with this flick: If you're going to make a slasher film, you 
   damn well better show the slashings. Besides a fleeting second of a 
   scythe cutting off a head, director Byron Quisenberry (who is a movie 
   stuntman by trade) has fashioned a rather bloodless take on <B><A HREF="friday_the_13th_1980.htm">FRIDAY

   (1972) and countless other horror films of the day. Originally lensed 
   in 1981 as <B><A HREF="outing_1981.htm">THE OUTING</A></B>, this film 
   didn't see the light of day until 1985 when practically every horror 
   film with a pulse got a VHS release. All the characters in this film 
   are from Stereotypes 101: The gruff, know-it-all who wants complete 
   control, the woman scared of her own shadow that screams at every 
   opportunity, the cowboy hat-wearing man who steps up at the plate, 
   the woman who falls for him and, finally, the man-child who is here 
   for sympathy and comic relief. Woody Strode makes a brief appearance 
   two thirds of the way through as an ex-sailor (huh?) with a pet 
   rottweiler who comes bearing bad news, spouts some mumbo-jumbo and 
   then disappears only to return in the finale to save the day. 
   Everyone in this film does stupid things that defy explanation (such 
   as stacking the dead bodies like cords of wood), there's blatant Dr. 
   Pepper product placement and the suspense is sorely lacking. Jesus, 
   this film is bad! If there's one good point to this film, it's the 
   music. While it does sound awfully familiar to John Carpenter's theme

   hitches a ride out of town with a newlywed couple. He murders the

   Daisy he tells her he is rich and lives in a mansion. Matthew finds a

   give the former occupant her arthritis shot. The doc is killed when 
   he becomes suspicious and finds the dead bodies. Daisy tries a 
   different approach. She entices the virgin Matthew with her naked 
   body. As they are about to dance between the sheets, Matthew sees his 
   mother's face and kills the poor Daisy. His mother's face doesn't

    OF BLOOD</A></B> (1971) and many others (a lot reviewed on this 
   site). There is just something creepy and dangerous about an 
   amusement park or carnival closed at night, especially the carnies 
   and performers that live at the places, as they travel town-to-town 
   (even the stationary ones are creepy when you visit them at night, 
   something I did several times as a teenager with my friends, getting 
   caught once by the carnies and having a shotgun fired over our 
   heads!). This film takes place at a stationary amusement park that is 
   closing in a few days (actually filmed&nbsp; at Conneaut Lake Park in 
   Pennsylvania, an actual amusement park that was closed in the early 
   Spring when this film was lensed), thanks to dwindling attendence, a 
   mostly disinterested employee force and a general lack of care from 
   the corporation that owns it (the girl who runs the rollercoaster 
   smokes in front of the few kids that are still there). The park's 
   guard watches <B><A HREF="night_of_the_living_dead_1968.htm">NIGHT OF 
   THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> (1968) on one of the monitors (one of three 
   films I viewed this week where people were watching George Romero's 
   classic!) rather than watching the other monitors, where cameras are 
   at every ride and the parking lot, missing a strange brown van with a 
   cracked windshield driving into the parking lot at closing time (the 
   ominous music lets us know that whomever is in that van is not

   single location), filed for bankruptcy and all his bank accounts were

   the park (What is Marty going to do, fire them?). Red-headed park 
   employee Roy (Kyle Riordan) comes back from the liquor store and 
   passes the brown van, which is now empty. One of the employees named 
   Blake did not make it to the meeting and cannot be found, even though 
   his car is still in the parking lot. The guard does his nightly 
   perimeter search of the park to make sure no kids were left on the 
   rides. It's apparent that there is someone in the park that does not 
   belong there, as the guard is hung by his neck by a piece of rope and 
   then stabbed in the heart with a screwdriver. Employee Jennifer 
   (Wendy Wygant), the good girl of the bunch, senses something is wrong 
   when her boyfriend Blake still has not shown up and the guard is late 
   coming back from making his rounds (he is never late). The rest of 
   the employees get drunk, smoke pot and have sex in the Ladies Room. 
   Jennifer and Marty spot a couple of oddly-dressed strangers in the 
   park and decide to warn the others, while one of the strangers (who 
   wears a mask with a huge beak) shoves Carlee's (Kailey Marie Harris) 
   face in the deep fryer, burning her face off. Carlee's boyfriend Tony 
   (Dean Jacobs) is knocked out and, when he wakes up, he discovers that 
   his arms and legs are duct-taped to a rollercoaster car, while the 
   beak-masked stranger slices his stomach open and pulls out some of 
   his innards. When Jennifer and Marty investigate why the 
   rollercoaster is operational, they discover more of Tony's intestines 
   spill out when his car stops. Another girl has her throat graphically 
   slit open by the other stranger (wearing a burlap bag over his head, 
   making him look like a hulking scarecrow) and soon the two strangers 
   begin killing the rest of the employees one-by-one because it is 
   &quot;their job&quot;. With the landlines not working and all the 
   employees cell phones missing (clue alert!), the employees fight back 
   by any means possible (the gates to leave the park are padlocked), 
   but another male employee is scalped and his girlfriend has her faced 
   wiped in his blood before she is dispatched. The killers turn out to 
   be Ogre (Ian Lemmon) and Iggy (Skinny Puppy musician Nivek Ogre; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#a2001ManiacsScreams">2001

   'Ogre' Ogilvie&quot; here) and Ogre kills Allison (Alicia Marie 
   Marcucci) with an axe to her head until only Jennifer and Marty are 
   left. Marty thinks he knows what is going on, as he has a flashback 
   to a meeting he had with Mr. Hyde a few weeks earlier (if you look 
   closely at Mr. Hyde's desk, you will see the Lament Configuation Box 
   and Mr. Hyde even moves it!), where Mr. Hyde says, &quot;People don't 
   ride the rollercoasters or brave the funhouses. Now they ride their 
   couches and brave the commercials.&quot; (scary, but true). He goes 
   on to say that if the amusement park were to survive, &quot;We need 
   something novel. Something catastrophic. Almost like...a...an 
   accident.&quot; Marty tells Jennifer that he believes Mr. Hyde set up 
   this mass murder to make this amusement park popular again. What 
   better way to put people's asses in the rides' seats than the 
   slaughter of innocent people? Crowds love to gather at crime scenes 
   or accidents; the bloodier, the better. Still at the flashback, Mr. 
   Hyde says, &quot;Think of the news coverage. Think of the crowds. We 
   would never have to worry about profits again!&quot; Jennifer is 
   incensed with Marty for not telling her or anyone else at the park 
   about this conversation before (earlier, Jennifer stabbed Ogre in the 
   back with a butcher knife when he attacked her and Marty and it 
   didn't affect him at all). Jennifer decides to go outside to grab the 
   guard's gun, while Marty stays behind and watches the monitors. She 
   leaves the safety of the guard's office and ventures into the park, 
   only to discover that Iggy already took his gun and he takes Jennifer 
   prisoner. She is saved by Roy (who has managed to stay in the shadows 
   away from the two psychos) and Jennifer escapes with the gun, while 
   Ogre snaps Roy's neck like a twig. Jennifer finds the headless corpse 
   of her boyfriend Blake and kills Ogre by pumping him full of lead 
   with the gun. She is then chased by Iggy through the park and 
   Jennifer climbs to the top of the wooden rollercoaster. Iggy catches 
   up and begins to strangle her with his bare hands, but Jennifer 
   gouges both his eyes out with her fingers and kicks him off the 
   rollercoaster, Iggy falling to his death. Morning arrives and so do 
   the police and the news crews. We then discover that Marty is keeping 
   Blake's head in his locker. Does Marty want Jennifer all to himself 
   (throughout the film, we see Marty trying to hit on her) or was it 
   him who orchestrated this mass slaughter and not Mr. Hyde? If <A HREF="http://www.imdb.com">IMDb</A> 
   is correct, we may discover the answer in <B>RETURN TO SCREAM PARK</B>,
    which is supposedly being made in 2016 and will answer those 
   questions.&nbsp; This gore film, partially financed by internet 
   funding site <A HREF="http://www.indiegogo.com">IndieGoGo</A>, was 
   the first effort by director/producer/screenwriter Cary Hill and, 
   while it's not perfect, it is a very enjoyable way to spend 84 
   minutes (ignore the 96 minute running time in the DVD's sleeve). 
   There are some very bloody deaths (especially the scalping, where 
   Iggy wears the scalp on his head before he throws it against a glass 
   door and wipes the victim's girlfriend's face in the blood). Being 
   filmed at an actual amusement park gives the film an air of 
   authenticity, especially since it was filmed before the actual park 
   was given its usual new yearly coat of paint, so everything looks 
   beaten to hell. If your taste runs towards gore more than an actual 
   plot (although the ending did take me by surprise), this 
   semi-professional effort (the technical aspects are fine and the 
   acting by a cast of mainly young unknowns [Doug Bradley and Nivek 
   Ogre excluded] ranges from average to good) is a film worth watching. 
   Director Hill has a cameo at the end as a paramedic who takes care of 
   Jennifer and there is a mostly funny blooper reel as an extra on the 
   DVD, along with a shitload of trailers for other films (some which 
   look worth purchasing). Also starring Nicole Beattie, Brian McDaniel, 
   Tyler Kale and Carrie Lee Martz. A <A HREF="http://www.wildeyereleasing.com">Wild

   Being pledges, they think it's a test and one-by-one walk up the

   (Gil Glasgow) head out during a storm under the pretense that they 
   are picking up more oil for the lanterns. What they really do is put 
   on a werewolf costume and scare the shit out of everyone else. The 
   final story is about Crazy Annie, a mousey girl who decides to get 
   retribution on those she believes have mistreated her, only to go 
   crazy at the end. In the film's finale, the group finds out just what 
   caused all those murders and disappearances in the past as a violent

    OF A WINTER NIGHT</A></B> is a rather tame PG-rated anthology film 
   that is short on blood (up until the finale, when it pushes the PG 
   rating) and relies on psychological scares. Even though all the 
   stories are familiar campfire tales, they do raise some goosebumps 
   thanks to the claustrophobic atmosphere and a cast that plays 
   multiple roles (in the present and in the tales). This is nothing

    We are then in Frankfurt, Germany and the year is 1991. We watch as 
   cult member Martin Romero (Giovanni Lombardo Radice; <B><A HREF="action.htm#DeadlyImpact">DEADLY
    IMPACT</A></B> - 1984) follows a woman named Marion Crane (a 
   reference to <B><A HREF="psycho_1960.htm">PSYCHO</A></B> - 1960; this

   a not-to-subtle reference to the late George A. Romero and his film <B><A HREF="martin_1977.htm">MARTIN</A></B>

   stabbing her to death and cutting out her heart (offscreen). When a 
   thief tries to pick the pocket of Martin on the subway, Marion's 
   heart falls to the floor, scaring the crap out of the people in the 
   subway car. Martin is captured by the police and when they try to 
   handcuff him, he grabs an officer's gun, puts it in his mouth and 
   blows his brains out of the back of his head. It seems that in the 
   past three years a string of unsolved murders have taken place in the 
   vicinity and Justice Jonathan Ford (Donald O'Brien; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DoctorButcher1980">DOCTOR
    BUTCHER M.D.</A></B> - 1980) blames a satanic cult for the killings.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see old man Moebius Kelly (Herbert Lom; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#MarkOfTheDevil1970">MARK
    OF THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1970) pull a canary out of its cage and let 
   it go free while saying,&quot;It is time. At last, it is time!&quot;. 
   He travels by train holding on to a package as if his life depended 
   on it. When he is walking down the middle of a road (admiring the 
   Sun), he is hit by a car driven by school teacher Miriam Kreisl 
   (Kelly Curtis, the older sister of Jamie Lee Curtis). She takes 
   Moebius to her home and it is quite obvious that it is the place he 
   wanted to be. He talks in riddles (&quot;I am close!&quot;) and knows 
   more about Miriam than she knows herself. The big question is: Why? 
   Miriam has a pet rabbit, which she refuses to name so they can be on 
   a level playing field (WTF?!? Maybe she should sing a &quot;Rabbit 
   With No Name&quot;!). That night, while Miriam is sound asleep, 
   Moebius opens his package, walks into her bedroom and puts a 
   weird-looking insect on Miriam's face, which crawls into her nose and 
   disappears! She has a dream where she sees a naked man tied to a 
   tree, tries to free him, passes out and a crane crawls up her 
   nightgown and pecks her, ripping a bloody hole in her neck. When she 
   wakes up, she finds Moebius bent over and coughing like a smoker with 
   a three-pack-a-day habit. She drives to the house of Dr. Pernath 
   (Carla Cassola; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CircleOfFear1992">CIRCLE OF FEAR</A></B> 
   - 1992), but she is not there. Her nephew, Frank (Michel Adatte), 
   also a doctor, is there and he volunteers to go to Miriam's house and 
   look at Moebius. We then see that Moebius was just pretending to get 
   Miriam out of the house. He goes down to the basement, pulls off a 
   metal cover that was hiding a deep well (it has a ladder that travels 
   to the bottom), sets his package on fire and throws it down the well. 
   He throws a cloth over his face and then dies (the rabbit is standing 
   on him).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Miriam and Frank find Moebius' body and the well (Miriam has only 
   lived in this house for eight months and never knew the well was 
   there). When Frank examines his body, he discovers that Moebius has 
   fairly new scars on his wrists and comes to the conclusion that he 
   tried to commit suicide a couple of months ago. Frank and an 
   ambulance take the body away, but it is clear that Frank wants to be 
   more than Miriam's new friend. Then some crazy shit happens. Miriam 
   finds a young Asian girl in her basement. She steals the cloth that 
   covered Moebius' face and runs out of the house saying, &quot;Me no 
   bad!&quot;&nbsp; At her school, a young student named Samantha 
   (Yasmine Ussani) draws a picture of a bug, the same type of insect 
   that crawled up Miriam's nose. For some reason, it affects Miriam. 
   Samantha's mother, Claire Henri (Angelika Maria Boeck) doesn't come 
   to pick her up, so Miriam drives the little girl home. She meets 
   Samantha's father, Mr. Henri (Niels Gullov), who tells Miriam that 
   his wife has been missing for several days (So why did Miriam see her 
   minutes before school closed for the day?). She also discovers that 
   Claire was an entomologist who has been researching an insect that 
   has been extinct for over ten thousand years (I'll give you one guess!),</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Miriam's school teacher friend Kathryn (Maria Angela Giordano; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BurialGround1980">BURIAL
    GROUND</A></B> - 1980) finds the cloth on the floor (How did it get 
   there?) and when she looks at it (It has Moebius' face imprinted on 
   it). it wraps itself around Kathryn's face. Miriam manages to pull it 
   off, but Kathryn is now possessed by some unknown force. The normally 
   chaste Kathryn picks up a total stranger named Jack (Richard Sammel) 
   at a truckstop and he stabs Kathryn repeatedly. He tells his trucker 
   friends that Kathryn made him do it and that her face was on fire.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The water in Miriam's house becomes deadly, as her pet fish are 
   mutilated in their tank and the tap water has worms in it. Miriam 
   gets a phone message from the dead Moebius, telling her that he left 
   his diary at her house and she should put it in a &quot;safe 
   place&quot;. Frank then calls Miriam and tells her to come to the 
   hospital quickly because someone is calling her name. When she gets 
   there, Dr. Pernath tells Miriam that Kathryn just died in the 
   operating room and she was calling her name. Miriam insists on seeing 
   Kathryn's body (over the doctor's objections because she is still on 
   the operating table) and when she does, a naked Kathryn springs to 
   life, wraps her hands around Miriam's neck, yells, &quot;I died for 
   you, Miriam!&quot; and drops dead (The doctor says it must have been 
   a jolt of adrenaline!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Miriam tells Frank about the phone message, he and Miriam go to 
   the morgue so he can prove to her that Moebius is dead. Frank can't 
   get the metal casket open, so he punctures it with a metal rod and it 
   shoots a liquid into his face (well water?). Moebius is not in his 
   casket. We then see Damon, who is carrying a leather pouch that 
   contains some ancient metal objects. A female cult member shows Damon 
   Claire's dead body and tells him that Mr. Henri is &quot;one of 
   us&quot;. Frank spends the night at Miriam's house, where the well 
   calls to him. He climbs the ladder down to the bottom and discovers a 
   secret passage, which leads him a sparkling tree where Damon and his 
   cult insert hooks (the ancient metal objects) into Claire's face and 
   hang her upside down from the tree. Damon pulls her face off (a real 
   gory effect) and places it on the face of Moebius' dead body, 
   bringing him back to life. The sect spots Frank spying on them and 
   the chase is on. While Frank is climbing the ladder and almost at the 
   top, he slips and falls into the well. Miriam wakes up to find her 
   bed is full of creepy crawlers. She goes looking for Frank, finds him 
   outside her front door and he tries to kill her with a knife (&quot;I 
   know your secret!&quot;). Miriam tries to escape in her car with 
   Frank clinging to the car's door. She crashes (Frank is trapped 
   underneath the car) and runs back to her house to find Moebius and 
   the sect waiting for her (&quot;We are your family!&quot;). A female 
   cult member injects the tip of Miriam's nose with some unknown drug 
   and she passes out. She wakes up in her basement, the walls now 
   covered with satanic symbols, and she sees the crane of her dream fly 
   out of the well which, once again, pecks her neck, opening a wound 
   that is full of maggots. The sect lowers a tied-up Miriam into the 
   well, Miriam screaming, &quot;I don't want to die!&quot;, with 
   Moebius replying, &quot;You're not here to die. You're here to give 
   life!&quot; As she is hanging in the well water, she gives birth to a 
   fetus wrapped in a flesh cocoon. Yes, she has given birth to the son 
   of Satan (Moebius says, &quot;Our revenge against God!&quot;). She is 
   given the choice of raising the baby or letting the sect raise him. 
   What would you do? Well, if you were Miriam, you would grab the baby, 
   run to your burning car (Damon killed Frank by setting the car on 
   fire) and&nbsp; jump into the flames! When firefighters get there and 
   put out the fire, the water reveals an unscathed nude Miriam. Was 
   this the work of God?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This atmospheric chiller makes very little sense, but there is no 
   denying that it has a certain something that keeps your eyes glued to 
   the screen. It should come as no surprise that this was directed by 
   Michele Soavi, who also gave us <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Church1989">THE
    CHURCH</A></B> (1989) and <B><A HREF="cemetery_man_1994.htm">CEMETERY
    MAN</A></B> (1994), two other films that make very little sense, but 
   are watchable due to the atmosphere that permeates every frame. Soavi 
   has an uncanny <A HREF="devils_daughter_1991.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/devil's daughter 1991 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="307" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>knack
    of knowing how to light a scene and where to place the camera, 
   making the well look foreboding and other-worldly. His sense of 
   visual information is second to none. The screenplay, by Soavi, Dario 
   Argento (he was also one of the Producers) &amp; Giovanni Romoli 
   (Argento's <B><A HREF="trauma_1992.htm">TRAUMA</A></B> - 1992) offers 
   Soavi a chance to shine with his visual flair (Try to count how many 
   times water is shown as something deadly). What I found really 
   surprising is how much Kelly Curtis looks and sounds like her little 
   sister, Jamie Lee Curtis. Kelly never got the breaks her sister did, 
   as she has appeared in small roles in some feature films and some 
   small parts on TV but never got the recognition she deserved. This 
   was by far the biggest role of her career. She retired from acting in 
   1999. It was also nice to see the late Herbert Lom return to his 
   horror roots. Most people know him for his role as the comedic 
   &quot;Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus&quot; in the <B><A HREF="pink_panther_series.htm">PINK
    PANTHER</A></B> series of films, but he plays Moebius as such a 
   creepy person, your skin will crawl. When this film was made, Italian 
   horror movies were presumed dead, but you wouldn't know it by 
   watching this. If I have one complaint, it is that it runs a little 
   long (117 minutes), but you will not be looking at the clock.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Republic tape), but the <A HREF="sect_1991.htm">Blu-Ray</A> release, 
   by Scorpion Releasing, presents the film in its proper OAR and it 
   looks great. We can finally see Soavi's great visuals the way they 
   were meant to be seen. The extras on the disc includes trailers of 
   Italian films on Scorpion's roster as well as a new 30 minute 
   interview with Tomas Arana. He is a joy to listen to, as he describes 
   in detail the differences in acting in an American production versus 
   an Italian production. He also relates some funny stories, including 
   how he passed out when filming a scene in this film, where Damon is 
   smoking a joint (it was not real) and blowing smoke directly at the 
   camera. Soavi asked for several takes, asking for Arana to blow more 
   smoke into the lens and when it was time to film the next scene, 
   Arana got to his feet and passed out because he was not a smoker. He 
   also gives tips to young actors on how not to act in front of the 
   camera and he makes sense. I could listen to him talk about his 
   career (It is quite extensive. Look it up on IMDb) for hours. He is 
   very congenial and he should teach classes. There is also an 
   interview with Michele Soavi on the disc, but it is the same one that 
   is on Scorpion's <B><A HREF="church_1989.htm">THE CHURCH</A></B> 
   Blu-Ray. All in all, this is a wonderful release for a film that 
   should be on your radar. Also starring Paolo Pranzo, Erica Sinisi,

   (2007) -</B> Leave it to Uwe Boll, of all people, to finally make me 
   sick to my stomach. Not for anything he shot, mind you, but for the 
   real animal cruelty footage that he scammed from PETA and inserted 
   into the film for no other reason than, well, to turn our stomachs. 
   Sure, Boll puts a warning statement at the beginning of the film and 
   makes a (pretty weak) case for including the animal cruelty footage, 
   but it's a sad state of affairs when a director has to stoop this low 
   to try and shock us. <B><A HREF="seed_2007b.htm">SEED</A></B> is a 
   horror film that falls under the &quot;Torture Porn&quot; banner (I 
   hate that term, but in this case, it's accurate) and, unless you're a 
   fan of human and animal suffering, I'd advise you to steer clear. 
   It's not a badly-made film, but it's just about as grim and hopeless 
   a film can get without making you want to slit your wrists. 
   Inexplicably set in the 70's (probably to avoid such modern 
   conveniences as cell phones and the internet, which would render much 
   of this film moot), the film opens with police detective Matt Bishop 
   (a dour Michael Pare; Boll's <B><A HREF="tunnel_rats_2007.htm">TUNNEL RATS</A></B> 
   - 2007) capturing notorious serial killer Max Seed (Will Sanderson; 
   Boll's <B><A HREF="in_the_name_of_the_king_2007.htm">IN THE NAME OF 
   THE KING</A></B> - 2007), who likes to trap animals and people 
   (including a baby) in his dungeon and film them (using time lapse 
   photography) as they slowly die of starvation and then become food 
   for the maggots. Seed then<A HREF="seed_2007c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/seed 2007 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   watches the films (sexual gratification is implied) and sends copies 
   to the police, as if to say, &quot;Catch me if you can!&quot; Well, 
   Detective Bishop does just that and Seed is sent to Death Row, where 
   a few years later he is sent to the electric chair. As luck would 
   have it, the electric chair is faulty (the executioner has been 
   trying to get it replaced since the last execution, in which the 
   prisoner caught fire) and Seed survives two 45-second jolts of 15,000 
   volts. Since federal law states that any prisoner that survives three 
   45-second jolts shall be set free (it's simply not true, but it makes 
   for a good plot device), warden Arnold Calgrove (Ralf Moeller; Boll's <B><A HREF="far_cry_2008.htm">FAR
    CRY</A></B> - 2008) has the doctor on hand falsely certify Seed as 
   dead and has him buried alive in the prison's potter's field. It 
   should come as no surprise to viewers that Seed digs his way to the 
   top to get even with those who wronged him, beginning with the 
   executioner (who dies in his own electric chair), the doctor (who has 
   his lips bitten off) and the warden (impaled through the stomach and 
   pinned to a wall) and then kidnapping Bishop's wife and young 
   daughter and sending Bishop live footage of him torturing his family 
   (killing Bishop's wife with a nailgun). Seed wants Bishop to kill 
   himself to stop his daughter's suffering and the film ends on one of 
   the most nihilistic images in a horror film made in 2007.&nbsp; This 
   is a dank, dark and colorless film (most scenes are filmed at night 
   and are bleached to give them a sepia tone) that really serves no 
   other purpose than to shock. Director/screenwriter Uwe Boll (<B><A HREF="house_of_the_dead_2003.htm">HOUSE
    OF THE DEAD</A></B> - 2003; <B><A HREF="alone_in_the_dark_2005.htm">ALONE

   bad taste comedy <B><A HREF="postal_2007.htm">POSTAL</A></B> (2007), 
   seems to garner a lot of bad press, both from critics and audiences, 
   but I don't think he's a bad filmmaker, just a wrong-headed one. All 
   of his films are professionally made and cast with decent actors (I 
   just don't agree with people who compare him with someone along the 
   lines as Ed Wood or Coleman Francis), but they contain an atmosphere 
   of insane over-the-topness that no other director dares (or cares) to 
   duplicate. <B><A HREF="seed_2007b.htm">SEED</A></B> is full of such 
   scenes, the standout (or low-point, depending on your point of view) 
   being the sequence where Seed beats some poor woman tied to a chair 
   in the head with the blunt end of a hatchet over-and-over for what 
   seems to be an eternity, until the entire room is covered in her 
   blood and the woman's head is nothing but a bloody pulp (all of this 
   seemingly done in one long take, but it's obvious that CGI was used 
   here on the woman's head and some of the blood splatter). Now comes 
   the &quot;Boll Moment&quot;: Instead of stopping the scene there, 
   Boll has Seed plant the handle of the hatchet in the top of the 
   woman's head, like an explorer planting his nation's flag in some new 
   territory. This is what Uwe Boll is all about. There's hardly any 
   plot here to talk about, just scene-after-scene of bloody makeup 
   effects, including a prison guard (who tries to anally rape Seed with 
   two other guards) getting his head kicked through the bars on the 
   jail cell. The only bit of humor in this film is an in-joke where 
   Bishop's young daughter is watching Boll's <B><A HREF="bloodrayne_2005.htm">BLOODRAYNE</A></B>

   boring (consider it <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hostel">HOSTEL</A></B>

   pain and suffering. I've deducted a few points for the real-life 
   animal cruelty, which was totally unnecessary and sickening when used 
   out of context, as it is here. I'm also perplexed as to why the 
   warden would allow Seed to continue to wear his mask (actually a 
   burlap bag with eyeholes) in his cell and during his execution. I'll 
   chalk that one up to &quot;artistic license&quot;. Also starring

   Chau Zhou (Kao Fei, aka: Phillip Ko) is driving his cab one night 
   when he runs over a black magician who is being chased out of a 
   graveyard by a mob of angry, torch-bearing townspeople. The black 
   magician suddenly appears in the back seat of Chau's taxi and puts a 
   curse on Chau and his family. Chau's newlywed wife, Irene (Maria Jo), 
   begins having an affair with rich bigshot &quot;Anthony&quot; Fang 
   Ming (Hsu Shao-Chiang, aka: Norman Chu) after he showers her with 
   money and jewelry at her job at a casino (she's a blackjack dealer). 
   One night, Irene has a lover's spat with Anthony and jumps out of his 
   car, only to be chased and raped by two young punks, Peter and Paul, 
   in an abandoned mansion. When she tries to get away, the punks slap 
   her around and, after taking a nasty fall down a long flight of 
   stairs and still trying to get away, she falls off the mansion roof 
   and is killed. Chau gets a mysterious call on his taxi radio, telling 
   him to meet his wife at the mansion. When he gets there, his taxi 
   gets a flat tire and, when he goes to change the tire, the spare tire 
   magically rolls the the spot where his dead wife's body lies. The 
   police naturally think that Chau is responsible (his dispatcher 
   denies making the radio call that sent him to the mansion), but 
   further investigation by the police turns up Anthony's affair (he 
   cops to the affair, but not the murder) and Chau's recollection of 
   seeing Peter and Paul's red Fiat at the <A HREF="seeding_of_a_ghost_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/seeding of a ghost dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="168" HEIGHT="244" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>scene
    of the crime lets the police question the two punks. Everyone is 
   eventually released for lack of evidence. This is when it gets tricky 
   and icky. Peter and Paul try to kill Chau, but he ends up beating 
   them to a pulp instead (the police blame Chau for the fight!). Chau 
   then tries to kill Anthony with a baseball bat, but Anthony kneecaps 
   Chau with the bat instead, crippling him. Chau the goes to the black 
   magician he ran over in the beginning of the film and threatens to 
   turn him in for grave robbing if he doesn't help him get revenge. The 
   black magician agrees and performs an ancient ritual called 
   &quot;Seeding Of A Ghost&quot;, where Chau's spiritual body and 
   Irene's corpse are joined together (it's quite a sight). As Irene's 
   vengeful spirit goes out to get justice, Chau must constantly apply 
   coconut oil to her shriveled corpse to keep her comfortable (he must 
   also passionately make love to her corpse, too!). As with all black 
   magic rituals, revenge comes with a price. In this case, Chau's body 
   slowly begins to decompose as Irene's spirits torments Peter, Paul 
   and Anthony. And what lovely torment it is. At first, it's just 
   little things. Paul throws up worms after eating a bowl of noodles. 
   Peter's bathroom explodes all around him. Anthony's wife anally rapes 
   him with a giant plastic matchstick (ouch!). Things get progressively 
   worse for the three cads on Irene's shitlist and only Anthony seems 
   to grasp what is going on. He hires a white magician to break the 
   evil spell on his wife. Peter and Paul go to a phony medium, but 
   Irene possesses her body and tells the duo that &quot;My son will get 
   revenge!&quot; Being the two stupid dolts that they are, Peter and 
   Paul ignore the warning because Irene was only married for four 
   months and couldn't possibly have a son. Or could she? I'm afraid 
   you'll have to watch this film if you want to know how it ends, 
   although I will tell you that a baby is born and it is born with a 
   full set of teeth...&nbsp; This sleazy Hong Kong horror film,

   one of the sickest thirty minute examples of early 80's Hong Kong 
   horror, as corpses have sex, spinal columns are exposed and a battle 
   between good and evil magicians takes place. Too much sleaze happens

   purely intentional, even if the opening credits say it is based on an 
   original idea by Charles Band. The peaceful town of Comet Valley, the 
   site of a meteor shower 500 years earlier, is closed off to all 
   incoming and outgoing traffic for 3 days when its only entrance, a 
   bridge, is shut down for repairs. Pieces of meteors are found in the 
   barren forest, and upon examination, are found to be seeds from some 
   alien planet sent into space to multiply upon contact with fertile 
   soil. The only problem was that they crashed on protein defecient 
   soil and were lying dormant for five centuries. That problem is 
   resolved when the town's alcoholic, half-crazed physician, Doc Roller 
   (Bernard Kates), takes one of the seeds and grows it to fruition. The 
   result is three plant-like monstrosities (courtesy of John Carl 
   Buechler's MMI creature shop) who proceed to take over the bodies of 
   Comet Valley's population. Soon the townspeople are walking around 
   like a bunch of zombies, looking for more seeds to grow. Plant expert 
   Sam Hennings joins forces with the remorseful Doc to try to destroy 
   the menace before the bridge reopens. Their only weapons: Ultraviolet

    but still fun anyway. The only complaint I really have is Full 
   Moon's dependence on Buechler's F/X every time they have a film with 
   creatures in it. All their films are beginning to look alike, because 
   most of Buechler's creature effects have a similar feel to them. As 
   one of the few production companies still around to make low budget 
   horror, Full Moon should give some F/X work to the many new breed of 
   young artists, even if Charles Band has had a long affiliation with 
   Buechler (it dates back to Band's Empire Films days). New blood may 
   inject a sense of realism into the films, something which Buechler's 
   work lacks. Also starring Andrea Roth and Dane Witherspoon. <B><A HREF="seedpeople_1992b.htm">SEEDPEOPLE</A></B>

    Goodnight (WWE wrestler Kane, whose real name is Glen Jacobs) killed 
   seven people by plucking their eyes out in some weird religious 
   ritual. A veteran cop named Williams (Steven Vidler) and his rookie 
   partner are investigating a complaint about a woman screaming in an 
   abandoned building when they run into Goodnight, who kills the rookie 
   and cuts off Williams' arm with an axe, but not before he puts a 
   bullet in Goodnight's skull (who still somehow manages to get away). 
   Cut to the present, as Williams is now a corrections officer (with a 
   prosthetic arm) in charge of a group of eight petty criminals who are 
   released on a special program to clean-up the abandoned Blackwell 
   Hotel. Little does anyone realize that Jacob Goodnight is also 
   occupying the 8th floor and it's not long before he starts killing 
   the felons one-by-one, snaring them with a big hook attached to a 
   chain and then plucking their eyes out with his bare hands. Goodnight 
   kidnaps Kira (Samantha Noble) and saves her as his personal pet, 
   because she has crucifixes tattooed all over her body. If you think 
   Williams is going to save the day, you're going to be in for a shock, 
   because Goodnight dispatches him quickly (a hook through the jaw), 
   probably because of the huge hole Williams put in the back of his 
   head four years earlier. Now, the remaining felons must band together 
   and try to survive Goodnight's bloody religious rampage.&nbsp; 
   Although this has a generic slasher film plot, there's a lot here to 
   really admire. Gregory Dark (who also used the names &quot;Gregory 
   Brown&quot; and &quot;A. Gregory Hippolyte&quot; when directing 
   non-porn films in the past) gives the film a nice visual flair, using 
   hand-cranked cameras and other photographic tricks to imbue the film 
   with a nice unhealthy dose of atmosphere. Kane is also a real 
   imposing presence, as he prowls the halls with his lumbering nearly 7 
   foot frame, bald head and hands the size of baseball mitts. The fact 
   that he hardly utters ten words (flashbacks reveal that his 
   uber-religious mother tortured him as a child for having &quot;impure 
   thoughts&quot;) is a testament (no pun intended) to his visual 
   scariness. The violence in this film is definitely hard-R territory, 
   as eyes are plucked-out in graphic close-up, various body parts are 
   lopped-off, there's a vicious attack by a pack of dogs on a woman 
   hanging upside down and Goodnight makes another girl swallow her 
   constantly-ringing cell phone. There's also an unexpected twist (at 
   least for me) two-thirds of the way through the film that gives 
   everything that came before it a little extra bite. Kane's death is 
   one of the mosts memorable departures in slasher film history. Stay 
   tuned during the end credits for a humorous (if nasty) stinger. I 
   liked this film quite a bit because just when you think the film is 
   going to turn left, it hits you with a nasty, hard right. This is one 
   bloody good show. Even with all of WWE's hype, <B><A HREF="see_no_evil_2006b.htm">SEE
    NO EVIL</A></B> didn't perform as well as expected in theaters. 
   Maybe it will find the audience it deserves on home video and cable. 
   On a side note: After watching the &quot;Making Of&quot; segment on 
   the DVD supplements, I'm convinced that Gregory Dark has the biggest 
   ears I have ever seen on a human being. I believe a good gust of wind 
   would make him airborne. Also starring Christina Vidal, Michael J.

   acid shower while they are chained up, a security measure Walter 
   installed to get rid of his victims quickly in case the cameras fail 
   or the police arrive. We find out that the storage facility is being 
   sold to cokehead Jonah (Jonathan Silverman; also an Executive 
   Producer) as a place to store black market human body organs. Walter 
   notices that Jake is throwing a party and sees it as an opportunity 
   rather than a hindrance (When Trevor, who knows what Walter is and 
   even gave him a liver transplant (!), asks Walter what he is going to 
   do about the party, Walter says, &quot;Improvise.&quot;) Walter and 
   Trevor notice that all their previous 6 captives are now nothing but 
   dissolved human flesh and Jonah is expecting some human organs 
   tonight for a fortune in illicit overseas money, so Walter gets his 
   serial killer face on and gets to work with the people at the 
   impromptu party. He disconnects the phones and jams transmissions 
   from cell phones, cut the wires to the cars, turns on the electric 
   fence and makes it impossible for anyone to escape the storage 
   facility. After some drinking, sex (naked female breasts) and 
   partying, Walter and Trevor (who served in the military together) 
   begin collecting live human bodies (except for Trevor, who 
   accidentally kills a woman while hitting her with a baton) and we see 
   Walter performing an operation on the left knee of one of Jake's 
   friends (nothing is left to the imagination) when he soon discovers 
   he was operating on the wrong knee and has to do it all over again. 
   Jake and his buddies discover that his friends are being killed (He 
   unwraps one of his friends, who is covered in plastic and sees his 
   friend's intestines fall out!) and finds out Trevor is involved. 
   Trevor chases them and steps on a bear trap (What the hell is that 
   doing there?). Somehow, he breaks free and Trevor stabs a pimp (who 
   brought the girls) in the crotch (The blood comes gushing out). Jake 
   holds Trevor at bay with a flare gun and makes him take Trevor to 
   Walter, who is about to operate on Jake's girlfriend Sara-Marie 
   (Gillian Williams). Walter murders Trevor by stabbing him over and 
   over for disobeying him and escapes through a back door while a 
   fatally wounded Trevor tells Jake that Walter once was a good man. 
   Jake meets Jonah and his crew and fast-talks his way out of getting 
   shot by giving the crew a cooler full of human body parts. Coke-head 
   Jonah ends up shooting and killing his crew and then leaves the 
   facility. A newswoman comes on TV to report about the atrocities at 
   the storage facility, while Jake takes Walter's (we never find out 
   what happened to him) boat out into the ocean and has the overseas 
   money transferred into an account (the information was on a card 
   Jonah gave to Jake) and he suddenly becomes rich. Then Sara-Marie 
   comes up from below deck in a bikini and we notice she has the same 
   fresh scar that Trevor did when he got a liver transplant. What does 
   it mean? You've got me.&nbsp; This is by no means a good film. I 
   happened to like it just for the extended roles of Eric Robert and 
   Michael Berrymen, who usually only have cameos in films like this. 
   You can definitely call both Roberts and Berryman the stars of this 
   film. There are plenty of scenes of extreme blood-letting (especially 
   whenever Roberts operates on a live patient) and when Jonathan 
   Silverman (What in the hell is he doing in a film like this? It 
   certainly is a long way from <B><A HREF="weekend_at_bernies_1989.htm">WEEKEND

   (one gets shot in the neck and we see more blood gushing into the

   Tom DeNucci's non-direction and screenplay (He also acted in <A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Inkubus2011"><B>INKUBUS</B></A>

   being called a good film. I just liked seeing Eric Roberts and 
   Michael Berryman having a good time and it looks like they are having 
   it in this film. Otherwise, just stay away. This is not a horror

    to see why. Elise (screenwriter Marion Joyce) has been in an 
   institution for 12 years after seeing her father and stepmother drown 
   in a lake when she was 12 years old. Years of experimental therapy, 
   by her psychiatrist, Robert (Erik Rolfe), have &quot;cured&quot; 
   Elise and now she reluctantly is ready to go home to the empty 
   mansion where she grew up. While in the mansion, Elise has flashbacks 
   of when she was young and hears voices of her father and stepmom 
   pleading, &quot;Elise, help us!&quot; over and over, leading the 
   viewer to believe that maybe they didn't die in an accident after 
   all. She is also harassed by her failed-stockbroker stepbrother 
   Leland (G.E. Barrymore), who knows that she's worth millions (she has 
   no idea that she is rich thanks to Robert, who thinks she's better 
   off not knowing) and makes her life miserable with nasty little 
   comments. There's also the house's leering caretaker, Andrew (Anthony 
   Frank), who makes every word that comes out of his mouth seem like a 
   sexual chauvanistic remark when talking to Elise. It all boils down 
   to this: Is Elise slowly going mad again or is she &quot;pushed&quot; 
   along for more nefarious reasons? It doesn't take long to find out 
   the answer as pretty soon people start turning up dead, especially 
   when Robert comes to visit with his snotty girlfriend Diana (Bianca 
   Sloane) and they are forced to stay the night. Soon after, we learn 
   the real truth behind Elise's parents' deaths. It's easy to see why 
   Roger Watkins doesn't care for this film because he was forced by the 
   producers to use screenwriter Marion Joyce as the lead actress. It's 
   apparent she can't act after the first words come out of her mouth 
   and her thick Brooklyn (?) accent is a total distraction. But that 
   not the worse thing about her. She's butt ugly! She has the face of a 
   mule and when she opens her mouth, you have to turn away from the 
   screen for a few seconds because she has this huge overbite and the 
   gaps between her teeth are so huge, she could use chopsticks to 
   floss. It's hard to care about someone when you can't look at them. 
   Another real distraction is the use of voiceover narration to advance 
   the plot. It seems as if Watkins wasn't given enough time or money to 
   film the necessary expository scenes. On the plus side, there are 
   some nice camera flourishes and Watkins does know how to compose a 
   shot and they both add nicely to the schizophrenic atmosphere. There 
   are also a couple of of fairly gory murders (a scythe through the 
   neck; a corkscrew in the eye) and some nudity (thankfully, none by 
   Joyce), but this film is mainly a talky mess that is best viewed as 
   the rare curio that it is. As a horror film, it fails to connect.

   We are at a young boy's funeral, where a little boy tells everyone in 
   church that the witch Vardella (Jay Riley) has taken his younger 
   brother to a cave. All the townspeople grab torches and whatever else 
   they can carry as weapons and begin to storm the cave. A dwarf 
   bellringer says they should wait until the Count is told, but one 
   villager says damn the Count,<A HREF="she_beast_1966.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/she beast-the embalmer poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   all he will do is consult his books and tell everyone it is not yet 
   time and another child will be dead at Vardella's hands. The dwarf 
   says that, according to the Count, Vardella needs to be exorcised. If 
   everyone kills her before the exorcism, Vardella will haunt the 
   village for all eternity. The villagers are too angry to listen to 
   the tiny man and head to the cave to confront Vardella, who, in witch 
   form, is a disgusting pea soup green color with dirty, stringy white 
   hair and a face no mother could love. When the priest demands 
   Vardella come out of the cave, she does, bounding out of the cave 
   very quickly while screaming, as the villagers pin her to the ground 
   (She puts up a good fight, killing a couple of villagers before being 
   restrained). They carry Vardella to the lake, where the &quot;dunking 
   chair&quot; awaits her. The dwarf runs to the castle of the Count to 
   tell him what is about to transpire, but can the Count (also 
   portrayed by John Karlsen; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CryptOfVampire1964">CRYPT
    OF THE VAMPIRE</A></B> - 1964) stop the villagers from killing 
   Vardella before an exorcism is performed on her? This wouldn't be 
   much of a film if all of the pieces were to fall in place this early, 
   now would it? We watch as the villagers bind Vardella to the dunking 
   chair and, as they are about to drown her, the witch curses the 
   villagers by saying, &quot;Hold! On this day be ye with your 
   decendants cursed until all eternity! Think not that ye are rid of 
   me, for I, Vardella, will return! Vardella will return!&quot; The 
   villagers hammer a red-hot spike through the chair into Vardella's 
   back to ensure she cannot escape and proceed with the dunking. The 
   Count and the dwarf watch from the top of a hill as the villagers 
   drown a screaming Vardella, knowing full well that the village is now 
   cursed forever.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   where hotel owner Ladislav Groper (Mel Welles; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#ChoppingMall1986">CHOPPING

   tea bags!). They notice that this small town is occupied by people 
   who can politely be called two bricks short of a wall (they 
   previously talked to a really loony policeman on a bicycle when 
   asking directions to the hotel), but they accept it in typical 
   British fashion. They see Fritz Von Helsing enjoying a ride on a 
   child's swing set and he gets up and introduces himself to the 
   couple. When he tells them his name, Veronica asks him if any 
   &quot;Draculas&quot; still roam this land. Fritz says no, his 
   ancestors rid this town of vampires, but he offers to tell the 
   newlyweds about the curse Vardella put on this town two hundred years 
   ago (to the day) if they buy him a bottle of vodka. The couple do and 
   Fritz tells them that Vardella will return to life very soon, 
   offering to show them proof, but the couple are too tired and they 
   retire for the night. Fritz tells them he will stop by their room

    Veronica and Philip soon realize that they shouldn't have stopped in 
   this town, when Groper bursts into their room without knocking. He 
   tells the newlyweds, &quot;No need to knock in People's Republic. No 
   citizens got secrets from brother citizens. Privacy breeds 
   conspiracy!&quot; (It's also obvious that Groper is blind stinking 
   drunk). As the newlyweds are breaking in their squeaky bed (Groper's 
   hotel is in a chronic state of disrepair; when he leaves their room 
   and slams the door, the doorknob falls off!), Veronica catches Groper 
   peeping on them through a window, so Philip gets up and punches 
   Groper through the window, knocking him on his ass. Philip then runs 
   outside and bashes Groper's head against a wall until he is 
   unconscious, his blood smearing on the wall as he falls to the 
   ground. Philip wants to leave immediately, but Veronica tells him she 
   is too tired. Besides, she has found a way to protect herself from 
   people like Groper, showing Philip that she's wearing a makeshift 
   necklace containing a clove of garlic (everyone in town is wearing 
   one). Philip makes her take it off, saying it smells and then they 
   make love.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next morning, as they are about to leave, their car won't start, 
   Philip discovering that the engine's distributor cap is missing. He 
   bursts into Groper's room without knocking (Hey. what's good for the 
   goose...), finds the distributor cap and drives off with Veronica. 
   Suddenly, Philip has trouble with both the steering column and the 
   brakes and almost hits an oncoming truck, sending their car off a 
   cliff and into a lake, the same lake Vardella was killed in. Philip 
   manages to make it out of the car and he and the truck driver (Ennio 
   Antonelli; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CastleLivDead1964">CASTLE OF 
   THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> - 1964) try to save Veronica, but they are 
   too late, Veronica is dead and Philip faints. The truck driver, 
   fearing he will get blamed for the fatal accident, brings the 
   unconscious Philip and the dead body of Veronica to Groper's hotel, 
   telling Groper not to injure Philip any more than he already is 
   (Groper takes a look at Philip and says, &quot;Even unconscious he 
   looks arrogant!&quot;), at least until he pays &quot;witnesses&quot; 
   to say he was in Aspen at the time of the accident (When the truck 
   driver asks a badly-bruised Groper if Philip beat him up because he 
   was peeping on them through their bedroom window, Groper responds, 
   &quot;Because he caught his wife making eyes at me!&quot;). The truck 
   driver reminds Groper not to be upset that the Kommissar has an 
   ulcer, &quot;Which is a lot less painful than what we will get if we 
   muff this.&quot; Philip wakes up in the hotel's kitchen, with a drunk 
   Groper sitting nearby. Philip asks where Veronica is and Groper 
   points to the body wrapped in burlap on a nearby table. Philip looks 
   at the body and yells out, &quot;What have you done with my 
   wife!?&quot; Groper rises from his chair and looks at the body. Sure 
   enough, it's not Veronica's body, but the corpse of Vardella. Fritz 
   then enters the kitchen, looks at the body and knows it is Vardella. 
   He tells Philip it may not be too late to save his wife, but he must 
   do as he says. Fritz asks Philip is he saw anything unusual when his 
   car plunged into the lake and Philip says he saw a wooden 
   see-saw-like object in the water, describing the dunking chair 
   device. Fritz tells Philip to trust him completely and not to ask him 
   any questions for the time being if he wants to see Veronica alive 
   again. Philip wants to go to the police, but Fritz takes him to his 
   ruined home instead, since the government dispossessed him of his 
   family castle (it turns out Fritz lives in a cave!). He hands Philip 
   a wood crucifix necklace, telling him under no circumstances to take 
   it off, saying this about the necklace and Vardella, &quot;Not quite 
   foolproof, of course, but enough to put the old girl off for a moment.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Philip thinks Fritz is insane and escapes from the cave&nbsp; when 
   Fritz is not looking. Fritz goes looking for Philip and when he 
   cannnot find him, he drives to the hotel and performs a ritual over 
   Vardella's corpse (He pokes at one of Vardella's eyes on her 
   maggot-ridden face, causing it to bleed). Vardella springs to life 
   and kills Fritz, while Groper tries to rape his niece (Lucretia Love; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#BattleOfTheAmazons">BATTLE
    OF THE AMAZONS</A></B> - 1973) when she pays him a visit (I know 
   that Groper is considered this film's &quot;comedy relief&quot;, but 
   he is a pretty disgusting human being, too. You can also see brief 
   flashes of Lucretia Love's nipples when she wrestles with Mel Welles 
   on a bed, but it has been edited out of most prints, but not the one 
   I'm watching!). The niece escapes her horny uncle's grasp and runs 
   away. Philip then appears and tells Groper to call the police, but he 
   knocks out Philip with a vodka bottle to his head instead (&quot;Oh 
   my God, I killed him! I killed him dead!&quot;). Groper drags 
   Philip's body to the middle of the road, hoping the oncoming vehicle 
   belonging to the truck driver will run him over, but the trucker 
   manages to just miss him. It turns out Fritz wasn't dead at all, he 
   was simply unconscious (I guess that happens a lot in Vaubrac!). He 
   pulls Philip off the road and tells him to stick with him if he want 
   to see Veronica alive. Meanwhile, Vardella hacks a hiding Groper with 
   a sickle (Look for an inside joke about Communism involving the 
   sickle next to a hammer!). Fritz tells Philip that Vardella has 
   returned and she has chosen Veronica's spirit to possess. Today is 
   the 200th anniversary of her death and she has sworn vengeance on the 
   village just before she died. The decendants to all who were present 
   at her death are already marked as victims. The only way Fritz can 
   reunite Philip with Veronica is to keep Vardella alive until he is 
   able to achieve a complete exorcism. Fritz can see by the look on 
   Philip's face that he doesn't believe any of this, even though Philip 
   says (rather unconvincingly) that he does believe him. Philip will 
   finally believe Fritz when he sees dead bodies littering the streets, 
   all victims of Vardella. Philip and Fritz then try to protect the 
   decendants of the curse.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Vardella tries to kill a young boy (Woody Welles, the son of 
   Mel Welles) trying to sneak a peek through a window at a cockfight, 
   Philip and Fritz drug and subdue Vardella, placing her body in a 
   wooden box covered in blocks of ice located in the hotel's kitchen 
   (Fritz tells Philip not to worry, Vardella is use to the cold). 
   Philip wonders what happened to Groper and Fritz tells him&nbsp; he 
   is probably dead, since he was one of those marked for Vardella's 
   vengeance. Fritz tells Philip that they just have enough time to 
   prepare the complete exorcism, since it will be exactly two hundred 
   years of Vardella's death at 6:00 PM tonight. Complications ensue 
   when the police raid the hotel and find Vardella's body, taking it to 
   the police station and locking it in a cell. Can Fritz and Philip 
   retrieve Vardella's body before it's too late? Can they perform a 
   complete exorcism, where Vardella &quot;gives birth&quot; to 
   Veronica? For the answers to these questions and many more you may 
   have, you'll have to watch the film, but it's really easy to find 
   since it is in the Public Domain (PD) and can be found on many free 
   streaming sites and channels.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    There is no doubt in my mind that director Michael Reeves (billed as 
   &quot;Mike Reeves&quot; here) would have had a long and successful 
   career in films if his life didn't end so tragically (He died from an 
   accidental overdose of barbituates on February 11, 1969. He suffered 
   from depression and acute insomnia most of his life and was only 
   25-years-old when he passed). His short career consisted of 
   uncredited director/screenwriter of the aforementioned <B><A HREF="castle_of_the_living_dead_1964.htm">CASTLE
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> (1964; he is credited as &quot;Second 
   Unit Director&quot; on the print) and, after this film, went on to 
   direct and write <B><A HREF="sorcerers_1967.htm">THE SORCERERS</A></B>

   Reeves also wote the screenplay to this film (as &quot;Michael

   [1981]). Both Griffith and Powell have brief cameos in this film, 
   Griffith as the loony policeman on the bicycle and Powell as &quot;Man
    In A Raincoat&quot;. This film is full of wonderfully comical 
   dialogue and situations (which I credit to Griffith), but it in no 
   way interferes with the horror this film holds. As a matter of fact, 
   the comical dialogue actually pushes the horror into violent and 
   fatalistic territory, proving that humor, if done right, can make the 
   horror even more horrific, by lulling the audience into a false sense 
   of security and then pulling the rug from under their feet. You 
   believe that nothing bad can happen to Veronica and Philip due to 
   their sunny dispositions, but when Veronica dies, it throws you for a 
   loop. This is where the film works best (at least for me) and the 
   short 79-minute running time doesn't give the viewer much time to 
   poke holes in the story (And there are plenty, such as Vardella being

   husband committed suicide a couple of years earlier (Bruno wanted to 
   move there since it is close to where he works, but we will find out 
   as the film progresses, that he has another reason). Almost 
   immediately, Marco begins to act strangely, talking to a tree in the 
   front yard, saying, &quot;Marco, that's my name!&quot; That night, 
   when Bruno and Dora are making love, Marco awakens from a deep sleep 
   and screams out, &quot;Pigs! Pigs!&quot; Marco is an inquisitive 
   little boy who doesn't remember living in this house, so he goes 
   exploring, going down to the basement, where all his dead father's 
   belongings are. If you look closely at one of the basement walls, you 
   will see that some bricks and mortar don't match the rest of the 
   wall, as if something is hidden behind it. When Bruno discovers that 
   Marco was down in the basement, he locks the door and pockets the 
   key, telling Marco it is much too dangerous for a young boy to be 
   down there, forbidding him from going down there again.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Then things begin to get creepy between Marco and Dora, so creepy, 
   it will make your flesh crawl. Marco is not only acting strange 
   (asking his Mother and Bruno if they are going to live in the house 
   &quot;forever&quot;), he begins to look and touch his mother with a 
   feeling of sexual longing (This kid is good at making you think 
   that!). Is it possible that Marco is possessed by the spirit of his 
   dead father? All signs point to yes. Since Bruno is an airline pilot 
   and is away for long periods of time, it leaves Dora and Marco alone 
   with each other in the house. One morning, Marco sneaks into his 
   mother's bedroom and climbs into bed. He begins to caress his 
   mother's neck while she is asleep. She responds lovingly, probably 
   like she did when her first husband was alive, only Marco's hands 
   change into what look like the hands of a rotting corpse.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Bruno is home, he and Dora throw a party, inviting all her old 
   friends over to the house. One of those friends is psychiatrist Dr. 
   Aldo Spidini (Ivan Rassimov; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Sacrifice!1972">SACRIFICE!</A></B> 
   - 1972), who we discover was Dora's headshrinker when her first 
   husband committed suicide. He was forced to commit Dora to a 
   sanitarium for six months when she started to lose her grip on 
   reality, after finding the body of her husband in the basement. We 
   also discover that her first husband was a drug addict who Dr. 
   Spidini was treating, telling an obnoxious party guest (Paul 
   Costello; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Cannibal Apoc">CANNIBAL APOCALYPSE</A></B> 
   - 1980) that her husband probably committed suicide because of his 
   drug use and that Dora came back to reality in the sanitarium, so he 
   had her released. At the party, Marco gives Dora a strange look and 
   says, &quot;Mama, I'm going to have to kill you.&quot; (He says it so 
   matter-of-factly it will send shivers down your spine). This, of 
   course, freaks Dora out and she begins a rapid decline in her mental 
   health, which Marco seems to feed off. When Dora tells Bruno what 
   Marco said, he tells her don't worry about it, kids will be kids. But 
   why does he look so worried?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Marco then goes really off the rails, cutting up all of his mother's 
   underwear, breaking the glass in a frame containing a photo of Bruno 
   and Dora (the crack in the glass goes through Bruno's section in the 
   photo, which will remind you of <B><A HREF="omen_1976.htm">THE OMEN</A></B> 
   - 1976) and then playing a not funny prank on Mom, pretending to be 
   deathly ill until Dora starts crying (he then opens his eyes and 
   laughs in her face!). But the most eerie thing is when Dora gets a 
   bouquet of flowers delivered to her, the card reading &quot;One for 
   each year. In spite of it all, you are still mine.&quot; She notices 
   the card is in Marco's handwriting and she confronts her son, 
   demanding to know why he wrote it. Marco denies writing it, so Dora 
   slaps him hard across the face (Hey, this is Italy after all!) and 
   then takes him to Dr. Spidini, telling him she feels her son is a 
   &quot;go-between&quot;, or a vessel for the spirit of her dead 
   husband. Dr. Spidini tells her to stop acting foolishly, otherwise he 
   will have to commit her to the sanitarium again.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Bruno's plane has engine trouble, forcing him to have an extended 
   layover in London, which leaves the possessed (?) Marco plenty of 
   time to drive his mother crazy. When Dora is playing the piano, she 
   slices her hand open and discovers that someone has hidden a razor 
   blade between the keys. Marco begins to draw violent pictures and 
   asks Dora, &quot;Mommy, why did you kill Daddy?&quot; Dora then has a 
   flashback showing her slicing her first husband's throat with a box 
   cutter. Is that what actually happened or is it just the product of a 
   mind that is quickly losing touch with reality? Are these things 
   actually happening to Dora or is she going crazy? A mother should 
   never be afraid of her son, but Dora is, deathly afraid. All points 
   indicate that Marco is possessed, but if you want to know the truth, 
   you'll have to watch the film. You'll be glad I didn't give away the ending.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Colin Jr., but he plays different roles in both films (and are his 
   only credited acting roles, which is a shame because he's very good 
   here). This has nothing else in common with the first film. That one 
   was an Italian copy of <B><A HREF="exorcist.htm">THE EXORCIST</A></B> 
   (1973) with its own unique spin, but it was still a good flick (at 
   least in my opinion). Bava's film is actually a taut psychological 
   thriller with horror overtones. While the finale is not much of a 
   surprise (at least to me), there is still much to admire here. There 
   are at least two good scares that will make you jump, one happening 
   when Marco runs to Dora, saying &quot;Mommy! Mommy!&quot; It's done 
   very simply, yet it will still make you jump out of your seat, thanks 
   to Bava's patented flourishes (You will know what I am talking about 
   when you see it). While there isn't much blood or gore, when it 
   happens, it's shocking and unexpected (one character get a pickaxe 
   planted in their torso). Bava certainly had a unique vision and knows 
   how to bathe a film in atmosphere, making this film a must to 
   recommend to my readers out there. The screenplay, by Lamberto Bava, 
   Francesco Barbieri, Alessandro Parenzo (Bava's <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Rabid Dogs">RABID

    BLADE IN THE DARK</A></B> - 1983), contains enough clues to tell you 
   what is really going on, but this is Mario Bava's film all the way, 
   full of his patented shocks and thick atmosphere. Those expecting a 
   bloody horror show will be disappointed, but those who like some meat 
   to go with their potatoes will be richly rewarded.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   fact that Hitler had deep interests in the occult) to turn soldiers 
   into indestructible zombie storm troopers, which was code-named 
   &quot;The Death Corps.&quot; (the shooting title of the film).

   the coast of Florida to be reactivated. It is now 1976 and a fishing 
   boat spots a glass-bottomed dingy drifting aimlessly in the Florida 
   seas. On the dingy is a dehydrated Rose (Brooke Adams; <B><A HREF="dead_zone_1984.htm">THE
    DEAD ZONE</A></B> - 1983) and the story she has to tell is the basis 
   for the rest of the film. We flashback to a few weeks earlier, where 
   Rose and three other passengers are on a small tour boat trolling 
   around the islands. The temperamental boat's even more temperamental 
   Captain Ben (John Carradine; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Frankenstein Island">FRANKENSTEIN
    ISLAND</A></B> - 1981) complains to first mate Keith (Luke Halpin; <A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Mr. No Legs"><B>MR.
    NO LEGS</B></A> - 1979) that the boat must have &quot;accurate 
   navigation&quot; (&quot;It's a sailor's best friend!&quot;), but the 
   sun starts to look strange (the whole sky turns orange) and they lose 
   compass bearings and radio contact. This visibly unnerves Captain Ben 
   and his crew (The boat's cook, Dobbs [Don Stout], says, &quot;The sea 
   spits up what it can't keep down&quot; which is very prophetic), but 
   they try to hide it from the passengers, which besides Rose, includes 
   an always-complaining Norman (Jack Davidson), his much put-upon wife 
   Beverly (D.J. Sidney) and the physically-fit Chuck (Fred Buch). In 
   the middle of the night, the boat is sideswiped by a ghost freighter, 
   which seemingly rose out of the ocean depths and has gotten itself 
   stuck on a sandbar. The next morning, everyone discovers that they 
   are stuck on the same sandbar next to a mysterious island, but 
   Captain Ben is missing. When it is deemed that the boat is no longer 
   seaworthy, everyone takes the glass-bottomed dingy to the island, 
   where they discover Captain Ben's dead body underwater. On the island 
   is a decaying old seaside hotel and they use it for shelter, but it's 
   plain to see someone already lives there (a working fish tank and a 
   Gramophone playing an old 78 rpm record are just two clues). That 
   occupant is an old SS Commander (Peter Cushing; his next film was <B><A HREF="star_wars_1977.htm">STAR
    WARS</A></B>!), who has been hiding on the island since the end of 
   WWII, and he is just as surprised as everyone else to see the rusted 
   freighter on the horizon. This can only mean one thing: The Death 
   Corps. Have been reactivated and they are ready to kill. The 
   blonde-haired, goggle-wearing, jackbooted zombies rise out of the 
   ocean (a very well-done and eerie sequence) and begin killing the 
   stranded castaways, beginning with Dobbs, who Rose finds while taking 
   a swim in the lagoon (his body is bloated and misshapen). The SS 
   Commander explains to the group what they are up against and offers 
   them a small sailboat to make their escape, but as we already know, 
   there will only be one survivor of this ordeal.&nbsp; While there is 
   very little plot to this low-budget horror flick (Weiderhorn co-wrote 
   the screenplay with John Harrison [<B><A HREF="murder_by_phone_1982.htm">MURDER
    BY PHONE</A></B> - a heavily edited version of the Canadian thriller <B><A HREF="bells_1982.htm">BELLS</A></B> 
   - 1982]), <B><A HREF="shock_waves_1976b.htm">SHOCK WAVES</A></B> 
   still manages to be a scary, moody film thanks to some totally creepy 
   underwater sequences (the zombies walking on the sea bottom is a 
   unique sight and Underwater Photographer Irving Pare captures it 
   perfectly) and the look of the zombies themselves (Makeup Design by 
   Alan Ormsby; <B><A HREF="children_shouldnt_play_with_dead_things_1972.htm">CHILDREN
    SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS</A></B> - 1972), outfitted in SS 
   uniforms and looking like the Master Race with a really bad case of 
   acne. I also like that these zombies aren't flesh eaters. They're 
   fast-moving undead whose only job is to kill, even killing the SS 
   Commander who created them (Peter Cushing looks impossibly thin and 
   frail here). There's very little blood or gore on view (just shots of 
   dead bodies and zombies rotting when their goggles are pulled off), 
   but there is no real call for it here, because this film relies more 
   on atmosphere than blood and guts. Must viewing for fans of Val

   (2001) -</B> When my first marriage dissolved in the early 80's, I 
   decided to change my life completely. I threw away all the bad 
   baggage in my life and made some new friends. One of the rituals we 
   did was rent a house during the Winter in a ski town called Hunter 
   Mountain in New York and get together every weekend. This co-ed house 
   only had three rules: 1: Everyone always had their own bed no matter<A HREF="shredder_2001.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/shredder dvd front small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="139" HEIGHT="194" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   what time they came home. 2: Absolutely no sex between shareholders 
   as not to cause any undue stress (although family members and friends 
   the shareholders brought with them were fair game) and 3: When you 
   are out at a bar you get your own ride home no matter who you came 
   with. These were excellent rules and this ritual lasted a good seven 
   years (and I still remain friends with nearly all the shareholders 
   today). In the seven years that I spent Winters in Hunter Mountain I 
   must have hit the slopes only four times. It wasn't about skiing but 
   about having fun, getting wasted and meeting new people. I eventually 
   met my current wife during one of these weekends. Alas, we're all 
   married now and don't get together as often as we like, but we are 
   still in each other's hearts. Just what does this have to do with the 
   movie you may ask? Well, in this film every rule I stated has been 
   broken and people are paying their lives for it. A rich bitch and her 
   snowboarder friends break into an abandoned ski lodge, where years 
   earlier a group of snowboarders killed a young girl by mistake. Now 
   someone wearing a black ski suit is killing the obnoxious group 
   (which contains the bitch, her put-upon boyfriend, a guy with a video 
   camera nearly attached to his face, a champion snowboarder, a faux 
   lesbian, a horny girl and a &quot;European&quot; hitchhiker they pick 
   up along the way). Quicker than you can say, &quot;Where's the

   snowboarders are breaking all the mountain rules and the killer finds 
   different ways to get rid of them. There's an icepick to the 
   forehead, a skipole through the head, impalement by icicle, a hanging 
   on the ski lift by a scarf, a hatchet to the leg, two decapitations 
   and a CGI disposal of the killer with a huge icebreaker. It's not 
   hard to spot who the killer is, but there's nice mountain scenery, 
   some excellent skiing and snowboarding footage, a few good scares 
   (including a head impaled on a fire poker being thrust at one of the 
   girls trapped in a closet, the film's highlight) and some well-placed 
   humor. It's just an ordinary horror film that doesn't take too many 
   chances and leaves a lot of unanswered questions, Like: What is a 
   fully-functional hot tub doing at an abandoned ski lodge? Director 
   Greg Huson gets props for ladling on the blood and gore, but the 
   characters are one-dimensional and the plot is full of holes. He must 
   be a skier because he enjoys killing snowboarders who refuse to obey 
   the rules (a major plot point in the story). Starring Scott Weinger, 
   Lindsey McKeon, Juleah Weikel, Billy O' (I guess he couldn't afford a 
   full last name), Holly Towne, Brad Hawkins and Candace Moon. A <A HREF="http://www.mgm.com">MGM</A>

   a sense of style and panache missing from most modern horror films. 
   Good Catholic girl Tara (Lindsey Haun; <B><A HREF="village_of_the_damned_1995.htm">VILLAGE
    OF THE DAMNED</A></B> - 1995) and best friend Lisa (Maya Hazen; <B><A HREF="shutter_2008.htm">SHUTTER</A></B> 
   - 2008) fly to Nothern Ireland to hook-up with Tara's boyfriend Jake 
   (Jack Huston) and do some &quot;shrooms&quot; (for those less 
   informed, a term used for indigenous psychedelic mushroom). Also 
   along for the ride are three other people; steroid-enhanced 
   musclehead Bluto (Robert Hoffman), who is Lisa's boyfriend; good guy 
   Troy (Max Kasch), who is a human encyclopedia of illicit drugs; and 
   Troy's girlfriend Holly (Alice Greczyn; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#ExitSpeed">EXIT
    SPEED</A></B> - 2008), who doesn't appear to like to shave her 
   armpits. After picking everyone up in his van and giving them a brief 
   pictorial history on mushrooms (both the good and bad type, including 
   the &quot;Magic Mushroom&quot;; the one they are searching for), Jake 
   drives them to a secluded part of the forest to do some shroom 
   picking. Things start bad right a<A HREF="shrooms_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/shrooms dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="203" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>way
    when the van hits an elk, covering the front of the van in blood. 
   Jake puts the elk out of its misery with a couple of shots to the 
   head with a tire iron when two backwoods men (who would give the 
   hicks in <B><A HREF="deliverance_1972c.htm">DELIVERANCE</A></B> 
   nightmares) appear out of nowhere and claim the elk's dead body as 
   their next meal. Undaunted (but a little freaked out over the 
   &quot;indigenous population&quot;), the group continues on their way 
   and eventually set up camp. Jake collects all their cell phones as a 
   precaution, so they don't call for help while tripping on the shrooms 
   (a unique way to stop the cast from using their cell phones that 
   doesn't involve the usual &quot;dead zones&quot; or &quot;low 
   Battery&quot; scenarios) and they go on their shroom hunt, avoiding 
   the black-tipped shrooms (Jake tells everyone that eating a 
   black-tipped one will cause your &quot;heart to explode, along with 
   your kidneys and liver&quot;). Tare sees a blue-tipped shroom and 
   seems drawn to it, eventually eating it and nearly dying in the 
   process. When she recovers, Tara tells Lisa and Jake that she can now 
   see into the near future and it is not going to be a pleasant 
   experience for anyone. As a matter of fact, It's going to be deadly. 
   Everyone think it is just the shrooms messing with her head, so the 
   rest of the group get drunk while Jake tells a horror story about the 
   &quot;Black Brother&quot; around the campfire. The story freaks 
   everyone out and Jake tells everyone not to eat their shrooms until 
   the following morning, but when everyone retires to their tents for 
   the night, nearly everyone ignores Jake's rule about eating the 
   shrooms. Troy and Holly eat their shrooms to heighten their sexual 
   pleasure and they catch someone watching them make love. This leads 
   to some long, pent-up anger among the group, which results in Lisa 
   kicking Bluto out of their tent. Bluto eats some shrooms, meets a 
   talking cow (who tells Bluto that he is &quot;dead fucked&quot;), has 
   his dick bitten off (Playing a sex game that Jake mentioned to 
   everyone in the van ride; I'll leave it to you to discover what it 
   is!) and is then killed by someone in bare feet. Tare 
   &quot;witnesses&quot; the entire episode in her mind and soon figures 
   out that Jake's &quot;Black Brother&quot; campfire tale may not be a 
   tale at all. How can she convince everyone else what she has 
   discovered when they are all tripping out on shrooms? There's going 
   to be a lot of freaking out and death before this trip is over.&nbsp; 
   Expertly directed by Paddy Breathnach (<B><A HREF="red_mist_2008.htm">RED
    MIST</A></B> - 2008) and written with a sense of the macabre and a 
   touch of black humor (the talking cow sounds like it was voiced by 
   Ian McShane) by Pearse Elliott, <B><A HREF="shrooms_2006b.htm">SHROOMS</A></B> 
   is a breath of fresh air amongst the hundreds of stagnant DTV horror 
   films that get released every year. The film makes very good use of 
   Northern Ireland locations and some creepy local actors (especially 
   Don Wycherley and Sean McGinley as the drooling backwoods brothers 
   Ernie and Bernie, who tell Holly &quot;Fuck reality!&quot; when she 
   tells them they can't be real) and, while the violence isn't overly 
   gory, it is effectively done and somewhat shocking. The surprising 
   finale takes &quot;Catholic Guilt&quot; to a whole new level and may 
   have you re-watching the film a second time just to pick up missed 
   clues. The film isn't perfect, though. Many of the scenes are 
   purposely drained of color and bathed in a bluish hue (I know it's 
   supposed to show the effects of eating the blue-tipped mushrooms, but 
   it is an annoying effect that is used in way too many horror films 
   these days) and Tara's &quot;visions&quot; (quickly-edited shock cuts 
   with over-amped sound and music effects) soon lose their 
   effectiveness after their third or fourth appearance. Still, <B><A HREF="shrooms_2006c.htm">SHROOMS</A></B>

   crushing her head in a vise. He then begins stalking the girls at a 
   local sorority house (where it is half-empty during Fall Break), 
   where den mother Miss Collins (film vet Viveca Lindfors) chastises 
   the girls for flaunting their feminity. One of the girls pays the 
   price by getting a faceful of steam, courtesy of Howard. Meanwhile, 
   back at the hospital, psychiatrist Dr. Gilmore (Belinda Montgomery) 
   is trying to find out why the dastardly Dr. Kruger (Roderick Cook) is 
   covering-up Howard Johns' release. Dr. Kruger says Johns is 
   &quot;deceased&quot; not &quot;released&quot; as it says on the 
   paperwork, declaring it a typo. Dr. Gilmore doesn't buy it and tries 
   to find out just what type of experiments Kruger is running on the 
   patients in his heavily guarded ward. Dr. Gilmore takes her case to 
   the police and tries to get info on Howard Johns from foul-mouthed 
   Sheriff Liggett (genre stalwart Sydney Lassick), who tells her to go 
   to the newspaper office. There she meets Mark McGowan (David 
   Greenan), a reporter who helps her unravel the mystery. She learns 
   that Johns committed several bloody murders at the sorority house 
   years earlier, and with Mark's help, goes undercover there as an 
   alumni to try to uncover more info.&nbsp; She becomes friends with 
   the girls there and she learns that Miss Collins knows all about the 
   murders. Miss Collins tells a story (told in a black-and-white 
   flashback) of how Howard was ridiculed by some sorority sisters 
   during Pledge Week and snapped, killing them all in the house's 
   boiler room. While investigating the boiler room, Dr. Gilmore is 
   attacked by Howard, but escapes. Now that she has proof that Howard 
   is alive, she and David have the proof they need to bring down Dr. 
   Kruger, that is if Howard and the evil doctor (and his goons) don't 
   get to her, David and the sorority girls first. Director Simon

   beginning and then slowly building suspense until the suspenseful 
   conclusion. For once, the 3-D effects don't seem to be tacked on as 
   they are integral to the plot and killings. No flying ping-pong balls 
   or yo-yos in your face here (just one unnecessary electric prod 
   thrusted at the screen). The acting is uniformly excellent for a 
   horror film and it's nice to have more than one bad guy to boo at, as 
   there are two kinds of killers here: The psychotic &quot;kill 
   anything that moves&quot; kind and the cold, calculating intellectual 
   kind. Give this one a chance and you'll probably like it, but good 
   luck trying to find a copy. It's just different&nbsp; and more 
   offbeat than most films of this type and there's a couple of killer

   never see), a single boy is the only survivor and he walks away from 
   the crash virtually unscathed. The story is immediately picked-up by

   a live interview with the boy, who they discover is an orphan. The 
   boy, Donald (Boo Boo Stewart; now there's a name that his parents 
   didn't think out too well, especially when he becomes an adult. I can 
   hear the Yogi Bear jokes now!), has some type of psychological and 
   emotional hold on Erika and Scott and since they are childless (Erika 
   is medically incapable of getting pregnant), they decide to adopt 
   him. Back at the hospital, a randy nurse and a horny doctor are 
   fooling around in a supply closet next to Donald's room and they both 
   ends up up dead when a steam pipe breaks loose, cracks the nurse in 
   the head, splitting her skull in two, and spraying steam directly 
   into the doctor's face. A freak accident? I don't think so. Erika's 
   sister, super-celebrity Mary Lou (Kim Little), expedites the adoption 
   thanks to her tremendous clout, so Erika and Scott pick up Donald at 
   the orphanage, but not before celebrity-hating priest Father Francis 
   (Robert Pike Daniel) warns them, &quot;God is always watching!&quot; 
   They bring Donald home and everything seems normal, at least for a 
   little while. Scott's father, Big Jake (Robert D. McEwen) comes to 
   live with them to take care of Donald while Erika and Donald are 
   working, but when playing catch and Donald gets hit with a baseball 
   on his face, Big Jake takes him to the dentist, where both the 
   dentist and his female assistant end up dead when Donald drills them 
   both through their eyes (The police deem the incident a &quot;terrible
    accident&quot;. A terrible accident? C'mon now!). Big Jake wants 
   Erika and Scott to hire a professional nanny for Donald and that 
   night Big Jake is killed when the ceiling fan in his bedroom slices 
   his throat (The police once again call it a &quot;terrible 
   accident&quot;.). While Scott is still mourning the loss of his 
   father (Erika decides to cover a story about a fire on the Santa 
   Monica Pier!), a crazed nun (Lucy Doty) suddenly appears in the house 
   and says, &quot;The reign (rain?) of blood is just beginning!&quot; 
   and warns Scott that Donald is the spawn of Satan. Instead of 
   listening to her, Scott throws her out of the house and she is killed 
   after being run over by a car. While Scott becomes increasingly 
   suspicious and begins digging deeper into Donald's history, Erika 
   becomes more distant (and she becomes more career-oriented when she 
   is offered a national TV anchor gig) and nanny Lucy Fir (Nora Jesse; 
   and c'mon now, &quot;Lucy Fir&quot;? Really?) shows up at the door. 
   Lucy is definitely in league with the Devil and knows about Donald's 
   secret stash of violent drawings (he's quite the artist). Anyone who

   Tony (Rodney Bowman) who, after accidentally discovering Donald's 
   bloody drawings, becomes trapped in a garage where he has his fingers 
   cut off by a lawn mower, is impaled in the back by a drill bit and 
   then has his face cut in half by a portable circular saw. Other 
   deaths include Erika slipping in a hotel bathroom and being cut to

   being shot in the head by a cop when he tries to kill Donald (At

   spitting image of a young Gina Gershon), but the whole film looks so

   &quot;Mark of the Beast&quot; isn't on Donald's scalp, it's on his

   Satan and his wife has a baby boy, wouldn't the baby be the grandson 
   of Satan? What's next: Meet Harold, Satan's cousin twice removed?). 
   Kate's twin sister, Sarah (Ridgway again), is found murdered in Los 
   Angeles; her body crucified above a satanic symbol. Father Deacon 
   shows up at the murder scene and tells the detectives in charge to 
   look for a birthmark on Sarah's neck. Kate has the same birthmark, 
   what looks like a small crucifix on the base of her neck. Donald's 
   life takes a turn for the better when his boss, Ashmed (Amol Shah), 
   promotes him to Junior Vice President and gives him a beautiful 
   secretary named Sydonia (Alma Saraci). Ashmed knows about Donald's 
   history (In this film, unlike <B><A HREF="666_the_child_2006b.htm">666:

   which makes no sense at all) and wants him to travel to Israel on a 
   &quot;business&quot; matter. Kate is informed about her twin sister's 
   murder, but when Father Deacon tries to warn her about bad things to 
   come, she doesn't believe him and runs away. Kate begins to have 
   disturbing visions (eggs containing bloody yolks; people on the 
   streets with demonic faces), while Donald is being seduced by Sydonia 
   and given grief by co-worker Tom (Stephen Blackehart), who is jealous 
   of Donald's new promotion. Donald becomes a success in his new 
   position, turns power-mad and makes love to Sydonia. When Tom catches 
   them together and threatens to tell his wife, Donald strangles him 
   and throws him down a flight of stairs, right in front of Ashmed, who 
   approves of the deed. Ashmed opens Donald's eyes as to who he really 
   is and Donald embraces it. Meanwhile, Kate is hospitalized when signs 
   of the stigmata appear on her body and the authorities think it is a 
   suicide attempt (in both of these films, the police are portrayed as

   protect her from her own husband, who must kill the baby with a 
   special dagger before it is born. Jesus Christ, make it stop! My head

   lumbers along with a series of loosely-fitting sequences that go 
   nowhere; religious mumbo-jumbo that makes very little sense and a 
   lack of any substantial blood or violence. There's really no point in 
   discussing this film any further because it is simply talk, talk, 
   talk about either forsaking God or embracing him. When the most 
   violent parts of this film are the flashback murder scenes from the 
   first film, it is time to call it a day and move on to the next film.

   and Louise Hickox (Floyd Ewing Jr. and Jennifer Mullen). Soon the 
   trio are up to their old tricks, cutting off the fingers of a 
   delivery boy (Mike Shea), shooting and skinning alive a Jehovah's 
   Witness (Producer J.R. Bookwalter) and cleaving Mrs. Hickox's head in 
   half with and axe. A disgraced, alcoholic ex-cop (Lester Clark), who 
   lives next door, notices their strange behavior and, in the finale, 
   goes Rambo on their ass. He literally blows apart Crawldaddy (the 
   film's best effect), slices open Violet's stomach until her 
   intestines fall out and blows apart Phinks's face. It all sounds much 
   more exciting than it is, but the main reason for watching is the 
   extras that come after. J.R. Bookwalter, director/writer Jon Killough 
   (who plays the first victin and most of the cast and crew are 
   interviewed for the 2002 remastered edition. Bookwalter ends up 
   looking like a controlling prick, Killough gave up directing any more 
   films due to his bad experience with Bookwalter and the cast and crew 
   also get in their digs and accolades at both Killough and Bookwalter. 
   It seems the film ended up being too short to be called a feature, so 
   Bookwalter took over the film and shot scenes of the cop's ex-wife 
   and lawyer emotionally torturing the cop to pad out the film to 
   feature length (75 minutes). It slows down the pace of the film, as 
   if it could have gone any slower. The extras are the best part of the 
   package as people either praise or put down the film and the 
   conspicuous absence of Scott Spiegel during any of this becomes 
   apparent. He had moved on to bigger and better things, directing such 
   films as <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#From Dusk 2">FROM DUSK TILL

   debut <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Dead Next Door">THE DEAD NEXT DOOR</A></B> 
   (1989), keep turning out SOV crap as his ego gets bigger and bigger.

   effects (supervised by David Barton [<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Dead &amp; Rotting">DEAD

   (Nicholas Celozzi) is having terrible nightmares about being trapped 
   in a prison while a hulking monster approaches. He reads a story 
   about a rock group called Body Bag being found slaughtered on 
   Alcatraz Island by lead singer Sammy Mitchell (Toni Basil), who 
   authorities believe killed everyone before committing suicide. Alex 
   feels a connection to that story and, along with his brother Richard 
   (Tom Reilly) and a few friends, goes on a &quot;field trip&quot; to 
   Alcatraz to try and cure himself of his nightmares (which are now 
   also occurring during the daytime). Leading them on the trip is 
   Carolyn (Donna Denton), a teacher and parapsychologist, who tells 
   Alex his dreams are tied to the history of Alcatraz (before it was a 
   prison, it was <A HREF="slaughterhouse_rock_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/slaughterhouse rock vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>occupied
    by Indians who practiced cannibalism). and he must face his fears if 
   the nightmares are to stop. Once on the island, the group begins 
   their investigation and almost immediately Alex is separated from 
   everyone else. The ghost of Sammy Mitchell warns Alex that a monster 
   called the Commandant (Al Fleming) is loose on the island and she 
   accidentally let him loose when she was shooting a music video here. 
   Richard becomes possessed by the spirit of the Commandant and tries 
   to rape his girlfriend Krista (Hope Marie Carlton). He eventually 
   rips her throat out with his extremely large (and sharp) teeth. 
   Richard then snaps the neck of Jack (Steven Brian Smith) and puts his 
   fist through the head of Marty (Ty Miller). The only people left 
   alive on the island (there are plenty of ghosts and only Alex can see 
   and talk to them) are Alex, Carolyn and Jan (Tamara Hyler), as the 
   ghost of Sammy helps Alex to open a door which will set all the souls 
   of the people who died on the island free and destroy the Commandant 
   in the process. Alex must fight his way to the door while Carolyn and 
   Jan keep Richard busy. They all succeed (Carolyn loses her life in 
   the process) and Alex gets a reward for his good deed: He gains all 
   of Sammy's musical talent! Some small reward for getting most of his 
   friends killed.&nbsp; Director Dimitri Logothetis (<B><A HREF="body_shot_1993.htm">BODY
    SHOT</A></B> - 1993) has crafted a somewhat atmospheric, if 
   derivative, horror tale, severely marred by some amateurish acting 
   (lead Nicholas Celozzi is the main offender and I guess he got the 
   job because his father Nicholas Celozzi Sr. was executive producer) 
   and an awful lot of juvenile and jokey dialogue between the cast. The 
   script (by Sandra Willard and Nora Goodman) doesn't make very much 
   sense, mixing demons, ghosts, cannibalisn, realistic nightmares, 
   Indians and rock music (original songs written by Mark Mothersbaugh 
   and performed by Devo). There's plenty of bloody imagery, as hands 
   are chopped off, rib cages are pulled out, people are disemboweled 
   and sliced up and Alex pukes up worms. Hope Marie Carlton also strips 
   nude a couple of times to keep your mind off the absurdity of it all. 
   But the story mixes too many genres and doesn't amount to all that 
   much. When Toni Basil (whose song &quot;Mickey&quot; burned up the 
   charts and fried everyone's brain cells during the early 80's) does 
   one of her patented choreographed dances about halfway through the 
   film, I was severely tempted to turn this damned thing off. The film 
   can't seem to make up it's mind up whether it wants to be a comedy or 
   a serious horror film and both aspects never gel together as a whole.

    SLAYER</A><A NAME="Slayer1981"></A> (1981) -</B> This underrated 
   little horror film is a neat slice of 80's cheese. Kay (Sarah 
   Kendall) has been bothered by recurring nightmares ever since she was 
   a little girl, especially the one where a creature with huge taloned 
   fingers grabs her by the neck. Kay and her husband, David (Alan 
   McRae), decide to vacation with her brother, Eric (Frederick Flynn), 
   and his wife, Brooke (Carol Kottenbrook), at a house on a secluded 
   island. From the moment Kay steps off the small plane, the island 
   seems familiar to her, like she's been there before. Island caretaker 
   Marsh (Michael Holmes) tells her that she's not the first one to feel 
   that way. Particularly disturbing to Kay is the abandoned theater 
   that they pass while walking to the house. Kay, who is an artist, has 
   painted that house on one of her canvases months before. She only 
   paints images from her nightmares, which is beginning to put a strain 
   on her marriage.&nbsp; Meanwhile, a fisherman, who is cleaning his 
   catch on the island's beach, has his head caved-in by someone 
   swinging a mean oar. Of course, after less than a day on the island, 
   a nasty storm blows in, knocking out the electricity and trapping 
   everyone on the island. That night, Kay and David have an arguement 
   (she tries to convince him that she's been to this<A HREF="slayer_1981b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/slayer vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="199" HEIGHT="246" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   house before in her dreams, but he's getting tired of listening to 
   it) and David walks out of the bedroom. David hears a noise in the 
   basement and investigates, finding water leaking through an elevator 
   shaft. David climbs a ladder and opens the shaft's trap door, but it 
   slams on his neck and he is killed. At the same time, Kay has a 
   nightmare that she is kissing David's decapitated head in their bed 
   and the next morning, when David turns up missing, Kay knows that he 
   is dead, but she can't convince Eric or Brooke that her dreams come 
   true. Eric and Brooke search the island for David, while Kay checks 
   out the creepy abandoned theater. She finds David's headless body 
   hanging over the stage and tries to convince Eric and Brooke that if 
   she goes to sleep, their lives are in danger. They should have 
   listened to her. Instead, they drug her milk and put her to sleep. 
   While Kay sleeps, Eric is dragged into the water after a huge fishing 
   hook punctures his neck and Brooke has a pitchfork shoved through her 
   back (it exits through her breasts, in the film's best gory effect). 
   When Kay wakes up the next morning and discovers the bodies, she 
   barracades herself in the house and tries to stay awake (even burning 
   herself with a cigarette). As night approaches, Kay realizes she's 
   not alone in the house. Someone or something is trying to kill her 
   and she hides in the attic after shooting Marsh with a flaregun and 
   setting the house on fire. Unfortunately, something nasty is waiting 
   for her there. A surprise ending explains it all.&nbsp; This 
   atmospheric, but sometimes darkly-lit, horror flick is the first 
   directorial effort from J.S. Cardone, who would later give us such 
   horror films like <B><A HREF="shadowzone_1990.htm">SHADOWZONE</A></B> 
   (1990), <B><A HREF="forsaken_2001.htm">THE FORSAKEN</A></B> (2001) 
   and <B><A HREF="wicked_little_things_2006.htm">WICKED LITTLE THINGS</A></B> 
   (2006). Although <B><A HREF="slayer_1981b.htm">THE SLAYER</A></B> is 
   nothing extraordinary, it's a decent chiller that gets to the scares 
   pretty quickly and is enhanced by the eerie island locations and 
   set-pieces. While the gore is minimal, it is brutal (freeze frame 
   when the oar hits the fisherman's skull for an example of what I 
   mean) and the creature effects are very well-handled, though insanely 
   brief. The acting isn't too bad either and there are no annoying 
   teens like in most films of this type. The cast of adults is 
   refreshing and this film would make a good double bill with <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Savage Weekend">SAVAGE
    WEEKEND</A></B> (1976), another horror film with an all-adult cast. 
   This film also uses themes (the blur between nightmares and reality) 
   that would be expanded upon three years later in Wes Craven's <B><A HREF="nightmare_on_elm_street_1984.htm">A
    NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET</A></B> and the surprise ending is actually 
   satisfying for a change. It doesn't seem tacked-on like most 80's 
   horror films. There's really not much more I can say about this film, 
   except it's a totally watchable horror film that delivers what it 
   promises. Nothing more, nothing less. Stay clear of the version on 
   VHS from <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Continental">Continental
    Video</A>, part of a double feature with Fred Olen Ray's <B><A HREF="scalps_1983.htm">SCALPS</A></B> 
   (1983). It's edited down to 75 minutes and cuts an entire character 
   completely out of the film: Kay's agent, Norman (Sandy Simpson). The 
   edit is obvious, as we see David and Kay talk about the trip in the 
   beginning of the film and then there's a noticable jump-cut to 
   everyone on the plane, excising a good six minutes of footage. The 
   rest of the film seems untouched as far as I could tell. Try to find 
   the VHS version on Canadian label Marquis Video or the British DVD 
   from Vipco, as they are both the uncut 81 minute version. Also 
   starring Paul Gandolfo, Newell Alexander, Ivy Jones, Jennifer Gaffin 
   and Carl Kraines as the Slayer. <B>Rated R</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

   student sleeping in her bed at her sorority house, only to open her 
   eyes to see a blue-eyed psycho name The Sleeper (Jason Jay Crabtree) 
   about to kill <A HREF="sleeper_2011.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/sleeper 2012 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>her
    with a claw hammer (His weapon of choice, but he does manage to use 
   a few more objects for killing as the film progresses). We then 
   switch to 1981, where sophomore college student Amy (Brittany 
   Belland) is invited to become a pledge at a party thrown at the&nbsp; 
   sorority house (the same one we saw in 1979) run by the Alpha Gamma 
   Thetas. Amy talks her reticent dormmate Ava (Ali Ferda) to go with 
   her to the party, which has to be one of the most sparsely-populated 
   sorority houses (not to mention colleges) in the history of horror 
   films. The sorority house has been getting a lot of strange calls 
   from The Sleeper, who mentions one of the girls' names and says they 
   are going to die (Remind you of any particular film?), so sorority 
   house mother Miss Joy (Beverly Kristy) warns the girls that all boys 
   must be out of the house by midnight. Cindy (Jessica Cameron) has 
   boyfriend Bobby (Paul Moon) come to her bedroom for some sex before 
   time runs out. Bobby leaves at midnight and Cindy has her face 
   graphically smashed-in by The Sleeper's claw hammer (Earlier, we see 
   The Sleeper in his private cubby hole on another building getting 
   excited over photographs he has taken of the sorority girls. When he 
   picks one he is going to kill he writes &quot;ZZZ&quot; across their 
   photo with red lipstick). When Cindy doesn't answer Bobby's calls the 
   next day, he gets worried and contacts police Detective Drake (E. Ray 
   Goodwin), who tells Bobby that maybe Cindy fell asleep at the library 
   while studying, but if he doesn't hear from her by tomorrow, to give 
   him a call again. Amy, Ava and head Theta sorority girl Laura (Jenna 
   Fournier) go to a bar, where they do a line dance (!) on the dance 
   floor with the other patrons and Amy meets Matt (Aaron Russell). Matt 
   walks Amy home, while Ava and Laura (who have become chummy) continue 
   to drink. The Sleeper has already taken photos of Amy, so when Matt 
   drops her off at her dorm, he is attacked and killed by The Sleeper, 
   who hits him over-and-over with his hammer (off-screen). Another 
   nameless Theta girl (Kendra Stevenson) gets the claw end of the 
   hammer planted in her eyes and Rebecca (Tiffany Arnold) has her eyes 
   and nose ripped off by The Sleeper after she walks out of the shower 
   (forget about seeing any nudity here). Derek (Eric Sarich), Bobby's 
   best friend, and Stacy (Riana Ballo) are next on the list, when Stacy 
   doffs her top (the only instance of nudity in this film) and pulls-in 
   Derek (fully clothed) into the college's indoor pool. While Stacy 
   goes to change, Derek is strangled by The Sleeper with a rope and 
   when Stacy hears the commotion and finds Derek's lifeless body, she 
   is decapitated by The Sleeper with an axe. As the drunken Ava and 
   Laura walk home, they are assaulted by The Sleeper, who blinds them 
   over-and-over with the flash on his camera. Meanwhile, Detective 
   Drake talks with Miss Joy on the phone and discovers that many of her 
   girls are missing, so he calls Ava and Bobby and tells them to meet 
   him at the sorority house. Drake taps the phone with the help of 
   Detective James (Luke Frost) and when The Sleeper calls, they are 
   able to trace where he is staying. Detective Drake heads to the 
   location, telling Detective James to watch the inside of the house, 
   while another police officer (Bob Ferrato) stands guard outside. That 
   doesn't stop The Sleeper, though. He rips out the throat of the 
   officer outside with his claw hammer and enters the house, where he 
   bashes-in the forehead of Detective James (off-screen) and rips-out 
   the eyes of Miss Joy (also off-screen). He then kills sorority girl 
   June (Elizabeth James) by impaling her through her ear with a butcher 
   knife. Detective Drake reaches The Sleeper's hideout, only to find a 
   photo of Amy hanging on the wall. He rushes back to the sorority 
   house, where The Sleeper is already chasing<A HREF="sleeper_2011b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/sleeper 2012 poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="250" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Amy throughout the house, trapping her in the bathroom and breaking 
   down the door with his hammer. Detective Drake saves Amy, but is 
   knocked unconscious by The Sleeper with the hammer and he continues 
   to chase Amy outside and right to his hideout (where she spots Ava's 
   lifeless body, her forehead split open with the hammer, although we 
   never find out what happened to Laura). As The Sleeper is about to 
   bash Amy's head in (He says to her, &quot;Night, night!&quot;), she 
   picks up a knife from a table and supposedly stabs him to death.

   where her doctor (a cameo from genre expert and movie critic Joe Bob 
   Briggs) tells her that Detective Drake is recouperating downstairs 
   and the killer has been caught. Sure he has. The phone in Amy's

   to flee her room and the film ends with a freeze frame of The Sleeper

   opening animated Canadian &quot;Restricted&quot; ratings bit and a 
   fake &quot;grindhousey&quot; beginning to make it seem like the film 
   was actually made in the 80's). The film manages to move at a brisk 
   clip (filmed during the Winter season), but everything on screen is 
   just deja-vu all over again. While the gore is handled pretty well 
   (especially Cindy's graphic face smashing and the eyes on Stacy's 
   [obviously fake] decapitated head still moving back and forth, 
   looking at her headless body), there is little else to recommend. The

   the car over on it's roof and the car explodes. He escapes, but his 
   girlfriend is burnt beyond recognition and he hasn't been the same 
   since (really?). Ron now begins killing everyone at the party using 
   such weapons as a long metal crowbar, belonging to irate elderly 
   groundskeeper Jimmy (Will Millar, who channels Groundskeeper Willie 
   from <B><A HREF="simpsons_tv_series_&amp;_movie.htm">THE SIMPSONS</A></B>),
    and a beer can (yes, you read right, a beer can!). Things really 
   turn hairy when daylight ends and the party turns into a sleepover

   - 1994) was aiming for a tongue-in-cheek horror flick, but he 
   populates it with people so unlikable, it's hard to give a shit what 
   happens to them (Really, I was hoping that Ron would kill them all in 
   one broad stroke to end the inanity). For one, Dwight is such a 
   heartless prick (he screws Shannon at soon as he arrives at the 
   party, leaving current girlfriend Karli to roam around not knowing 
   anyone), it's hard to have sympathy for Karli, who would have to be 
   deaf, dumb and blind not to realize what a cheating bastard he really 
   is. Another minus is having a psychotic killer with the common name 
   Ron. I mean, really, Ron? Hardly the iconic moniker for a mass 
   murderer, is it? While there is plenty of blood and gore on view 
   (including death by outboard motor, impalement by crowbar and having 
   a beer can thrust through one guy's forehead), it's so cheaply done 
   (either by using obvious CGI or throwing blood from off-screen onto 
   the actors), it's ineffective. Toss-in a clich&eacute;-ridden script 
   where everyone does the stupidest things possible at the most 
   inopportune times (When two cops show up at Shannon's house to see if 
   everything is OK, she doesn't believe they are cops and asks for 
   their badge numbers, like she would know the difference!)&nbsp; and 
   what you end up with is an instantly forgettable horror flick that's 
   a total waste of your time. I still cannot believe that these crazy 
   Canadians still fund films like this using their tax credits. If they 
   tried to make this film in the States using my tax dollars, I can 
   assure you that the nightmare wouldn't be the sleepover kind! Useless 
   Bit Of Trivia: Will Millar is the former lead singer of The Irish 
   Rovers (best known for their 1967 smash single &quot;The 
   Unicorn&quot;) and this film used his house for most of the interiors 
   and exteriors. Also starring Ace Hicks, Ashleigh Harrington, Jonas 
   Shandel, Graham Wright and Jolene White. Don't be surprised if you

   film look like a theatrical blockbuster. From The opening sequence, 
   it is obvious that this was shot -on-video and not digital video, 
   either, but something that looked like it came out of a 70's VHS 
   video camera. Mike (director/producer/co-screenwriter Mike O'Mahony) 
   is a loser of the first degree. He cant find a decent-paying job, 
   lives with his parents (his father rags on him every chance he gets) 
   and nothing ever goes right for him. He does kids' parties as Sloppy 
   The Clown and his car is dressed-up as a clown mobile. He runs into 
   old girlfriend Sandy (Lauren Ojeda) and she tells him she needs some 
   entertainment for one of her girlfriend's kids, who is having a 
   birthday party, and a clown would be perfect. Mike is all for it and Sandy<A HREF="sloppy_the_psychotic_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/sloppy the psychotic dvd front8a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="165" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   says she will call him. Mike has a party to do as Sloppy that day and 
   when the girl he is supposed to entertain draws a filthy picture of 
   him, he grabs the little girl and tells her she shouldn't be drawing 
   things like that. The girl's mother sees Sloppy grab her daughter and 
   kicks him out of the house, then calls his boss, Mr. Jenkins (Lewis 
   Beaver) of Clowns R Us and gets him fired. This turns out to be the 
   final straw for Mike, as he gets drunk, calls up a hooker and kills 
   her, stuffing her body in a trunk a dwarf wouldn't fit in. He decides 
   to become an independent clown and hangs up flyers all over town (He 
   never hears the telephone message that Sandy left saying her 
   girlfriend's party is a go.) Mike gets drunk all the time and falls 
   asleep while driving his car, hitting the wooden fence of a home 
   owner, who wants money for the damage. Mike says he has no money, so 
   the home owner, who sees Mike is driving a clown car says &quot;We'll 
   call it even if you make me laugh.&quot; The home owner takes a piss 
   into a hole in the pavement, filling the hole to the top. When Mike 
   fails to make the guy laugh. he says he has a sure-fire way to make 
   him laugh. He has the guy bend over the puddle of pee, hits him on 
   the back of the head with his booze bottle and drowns him in his own 
   urine puddle. Mike then confronts his boss as Sloppy and knocks him 
   out (With a sock full of change!), binds his hands and mouth with 
   duct tape and puts him in his clown car, where he stabs him 
   repeatedly in the stomach. Mike then puts him in the trunk (His 
   intestines fall out and Sloppy just picks them up and throws them in 
   the trunk) and then cuts his head off (off-screen) and leaves the 
   head on the bed of the little girl who got him fired (That'll teach 
   her for drawing dirty pictures!). Mike finally hears Sandy's message 
   and gives her a call. He thinks this party will make Sloppy The Clown 
   popular again. That night, Sloppy gets a phone call by some college 
   assholes, one who tells Mike he will pay triple his rate if he comes 
   to their party tonight. The forever-loser Mike soon learns that it 
   was all a practical joke , as he is thrown into a pool and everyone 
   laughs at him. Mike follows one of the college guys as a girl gives 
   him a blowjob (It is shown as a shadow on the wall of a building and 
   comes close to being X-Rated) and shoves a giant candy cane up the 
   guy's ass until it comes out of the back of the girl's head. He then 
   goes to the creator (and Sloppy's wet practical joke) of the party's 
   house and cuts off the tip of his dick while he is jerking off to 
   porn and shoves the tip of the dick into the dying guy's mouth (One 
   of this film's bloodiest, yet fake-looking scenes). Sloppy then runs 
   over three retarded guys (squashing one of their heads like a 
   watermelon) while their handler is inside a house buying drugs. He 
   comes outside, sees the carnage and says &quot;Oh, shit&quot;, like 
   he forgot his to buy cigarettes at a convenience store (his lack of 
   emotion is amazing!)! Sloppy goes to his party that Sandy set up (he 
   even cooks a meal for the kids that contains human flesh and another 
   special ingredient). Sloppy makes balloon animals (one shaped like a 
   giant cock and balls, in which the adults laugh at!). The kids scarf 
   down Sloppy's special food (They love it). Sloppy gives a cigar to 
   the birthday kid's father and it explodes , blowing his head off. The 
   kids get sick off of eating Sloppy's food&nbsp; and they begin to 
   bleed from the ass while Sloppy stomps their heads to a bloody pulp 
   (He throws the birthday boy into a lit gas barbecue grill and closes 
   the cover!). He kills all the kids and parents and piles their bodies 
   on top of each other. The film ends with Sloppy killing two policemen 
   and then slamming his garage door (after implying he killed his 
   parents).&nbsp; I've seen high school student films with more talent 
   than this video movie. Not once does director Mike O'Mahony even try 
   to act like a clown. Sure, he dresses like one, but he uses his 
   normal voice when entertaining kids. If I were a parent with kids, I 
   would ask for my money back because as a clown, Sloppy is a good 
   murderer. The special effects, while bloody, are even less than high 
   school level and can be done by anyone with a butcher shop nearby, a 
   gallon of stage blood and a pump.The closest this video 
   &quot;film&quot; comes to being inventive is when Sloppy is 
   threatened with a gun and the usual &quot;BANG!&quot; flag comes out 
   of the barrel, but Sloppy pulls out his clown gun and it shoots real 
   bullets (This is how he kills the two policemen in the end). Sloppy 
   also makes a hooker (Who is tied to his bed so loosely even a baby 
   could escape!) swallow his tied-together never-ending colored 
   handkerchiefs and then yanks it out of her mouth. Seems there was a 
   razor blade on the first one she swallowed and blood splatters 
   against his bedroom wall. Another thing: While we always hear his 
   father and mother rag on him, we never once see them. This is one of 
   the worst SOV films I have seen in quite a while. There is some 
   nudity, but it is by some fat frat chick that is giving the ower of 
   the house a hand job through the zipper of his pants (The same guy 
   who had the tip of his dick cut off), but this is strictly amateur 
   hour&nbsp; and making fun of the mentally handicapped for comedy is 
   about as low as you can go. This film reaches those depths and then 
   tries to dig deeper by showing children being fried, shit their 
   pants, or throwing up blood.&nbsp; I find it hard to believe that 
   Mike O'Mahony has directed before and after this film with titles 
   such as <B><A HREF="deadly_detour_2011.htm">DEADLY DETOUR</A></B> 
   (2011); <B><A HREF="ibs_2013.htm">I.B.S.</A></B> (2013) and <B><A HREF="dark_place_inside_2014.htm">A
    DARK PLACE INSIDE</A></B> (2014). IF you see these titles anywhere, 
   run, don't walk, in the opposite direction. Sloppy is insufferable 
   stuff. I would go as far as to say it is not a film at all, but a 
   home video. And more boring than your Aunt Tilly's trip to the 
   world's biggest ball of string. A <A HREF="http://www.chemicalburn.org">Chemical

   creatures and actually making it a creepy (if slightly overwrought) 
   experience (not to mention this film's obsession with local 
   government politics and basically nailing it to a tee!). Years ago in 
   the fictional town of Ashton (actually filmed in Lyons, New York), 
   some unscrupulous companies dumped toxic waste into the ground, 
   causing the slugs over the years to mutate and become hungry for 
   everything they come in contact with (in the film's opening minutes, 
   the little slimeballs snack on a teenage fisherman and a drunk about 
   to be evicted from his home). County health inspector Mike Brady 
   (Michael Garfield) and Sheriff Reese (John Battaglia) drive to the 
   drunk's house to evict him, only to discover his corpse has been 
   picked clean. Mike does a cursory investigation of the house and 
   finds hundreds of slime trails leading to the basement, but no sign 
   of the critters that caused them. Mike and his best friend, county 
   sewer engineer Don Palmer (Philip MacHale), investigate a claim by a 
   belligerent constituent that her sewer smells awful (they all do, 
   lady!). Don goes down into the sewer in full haz-mat getup to clear 
   the line (where he discovers human skin and a huge cow tongue in the 
   clog), but when something grabs his clearing bar and drags it deeper 
   into the pipe, Don makes a hasty retreat topside. Meanwhile, Mike's

   none of the adults know about, complete with booze, drugs and, of 
   course, sex (one mullet-headed female teen blames the drunk's death 
   on the &quot;Goat Killer&quot;, the town's mythical serial killer). 
   As the slugs begin killing the townspeople in various bloody ways 
   (including a gardener who chops-off his own hand with a hatchet when 
   some slugs crawl into his glove and he then accidentally blows-up his 
   greenhouse, killing himself and his wife), Mike notices a huge slug 
   in Kim's garden and tries to pick it up, but it bites him (it's funny 
   and frightening at the same time). Mike and Kim bring a few huge 
   slugs to Professor John Foley (Santiago Alvarez), who seems quite 
   surprised at their size (Later on, a slug gets loose in his lab and 
   kills his caged rat. Believe me when I say that you haven't lived

   begins to bleed out of every orifice in his body at a restaurant, 
   with baby slugs bursting out of his eye sockets!). In the film's 
   standout sequence, teenagers Bobby Talbot (Kris Mann) and Donna Moss 
   (Kari Rose) are eaten alive by a bedroom full of slugs as they are 
   completely naked and making love. Since Mike can't convince the 
   thick-headed Sheriff Reese that slugs are responsible (The Sheriff 
   retorts, &quot;What'll be next, demented crickets? Rampaging 
   mosquitoes, maybe?&quot;), he and Don decide to eliminate the slugs 
   the only way they know how: Salt. Lots and lots of salt. Not really. 
   It's actually some newfangled chemical Professor Foley has created 
   that makes the slugs explode on contact, but I would have used the 
   Road Dept.'s salt supply, because they end up blowing-up half of the

   (screenplay by Ron Gantman, based on Shaun Hutson's novel 
   &quot;Slugs&quot;) and make it so bloody entertaining. Not only is 
   the dialogue a hoot (When Mike learns that the gardener and his wife 
   were killed in a greenhouse explosion, all he has to say is, 
   &quot;They were very nice people. I liked them a lot!&quot; Or this 
   bit of hilarity when Mike tries to get the Water Dept. head, Frank 
   Phillips [cameo by Frank Brana, who has appeared in nearly every film 
   Simon has made] to turn off the water to the town: <B>Frank</B>: 
   &quot;You ain't got the authority to declare Happy Birthday!&quot;), 
   but the gore and nudity goes way past the film's R-rating (Someone at 
   the MPAA was sleeping when this was screened). Not only are there 
   both male and female genitalia on view, director Simon has a 
   predilection for popping victims' eyeballs out when the slugs attack. 
   When the &quot;Goat Killer&quot; is revealed to be an actual serial 
   killer (he stalks the teens' outdoor Halloween party, where nobody 
   wears a costume except him!), I just gave up trying to make sense of 
   the story (and the utterly stupid things some of the people do and 
   say) and went along for the ride (The &quot;Goat Killer&quot; 
   sequence is immediately dropped when the girl he is trying to rape 
   and kill falls down a sewer drain and is eaten by the slugs!). The

   Yes, it's time once again for a bunch of nubile young bimbos to hold 
   a slumber party and then get slaughtered by someone wielding an 
   oversized electric drill (among other weapons) in this third and 
   final, yet unrelated, film in the series (it was filmed under the 
   title <B>STAB IN THE DARK</B> before uncredited Executive Producer 
   Roger Corman changed the name to make it more marketable). Jackie 
   Cassidy (Keely Christian) is hosting a slumber party at her home, 
   where five girls come over, put on lingerie and talk about sex and 
   boys. Little do they know that some (as yet) unknown person dressed 
   in a black hooded sweatshirt and white mask is watching their every 
   move. The party is invaded by three local boys who scare the shit out 
   of the girls. The girls chase them out of the house and when one of 
   the guys, Michael (Garon Grigsby), comes back to apologize, he is 
   promptly impaled in the stomach with a For Sale sign by the <A HREF="slumber_party_massacre_3_1990.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/slumber party massacre 3 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="267" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>killer.
    The next to die is the pizza delivery girl, who, after delivering 
   the pizza to the girls, is chased down the middle of the street by 
   the killer and run-through with the drill. The list of suspects is 
   plentiful: Could it be the weirdo (Yan Birch) who picked up Jackie's 
   address book while they were playing volleyball on the beach earlier 
   in the day? Or how about Ken (Brittain Frye), a jock from another 
   school who has his eye on Juliette (Lulu Wilson)? There's also nerdy 
   Duncan (David Greenlee), who desperately wants to be part of the 
   gang. Let's not forget about Morgan (M.K. Harris), a prospective 
   boarder for a spare bedroom for rent in Jackie's house. Finally, 
   there's Frank (David Lawrence), Jackie's new boyfriend who has a 
   troubled past. When Juliette is electrocuted while taking a shower by 
   the killer (He throws an electric vibrator into the water!) and 
   everyone else discovers her body, we discover who the killer is (I 
   won't spoil it for you) and his reasons for the killings. Jackie and 
   her scantily clad friends must fight off the driller killer, who has 
   them all trapped in the house. In the finale, Jackie manages to 
   defeat the killer with his own weapon, after other members of the 
   party (most of them end up dead) shoot him in the leg with a spear 
   gun, blind him with bleach and bean him over the head with a polo 
   mallet.&nbsp; Leave it to Roger Corman. He always finds a way to 
   bypass the screams of &quot;Misogyny!&quot; by feminists and 
   Christian fundamentalists. As with the other <B><A HREF="slumber_party_massacre_1982.htm">SLUMBER
    PARTY MASSACRE</A></B> films, he has hired a female director (Sally 
   Mattison, who also wrote and performs two songs on the soundtrack) 
   and screenwriter (Catherine Cyran, who also produced), as if to give 
   a big middle finger to all those who think only men can make a film 
   full of female nudity and gory violence (and, really, what is the 
   drill if nothing but a symbolic extension of the killer's penis?). 
   This film is much less jokey than <B><A HREF="slumber_party_massacre_2_1987.htm">SLUMBER
    PARTY MASSACRE II</A></B> (1987), where the killer had a drill 
   attached to an electric guitar. This is more straight-ahead horror 
   which gets to the killings rather quickly. To add confusion to the 
   mix, there are three different edits of Part III: In 1990, New 
   Horizons Home Video issued an R-rated 75 minute cut (the same as the 
   theatrical release) and an 80 minute Unrated Edition that greatly 
   expands the gore scenes (much more bloody drilling, slashing and an 
   extended version of the chainsaw fight between Tom [David Kriegel] 
   and Ken, as well as much more bloody footage of Jackie's revenge on 
   the killer in the finale). Then, in 2000, New Horizons issued an 
   87-minute R-rated edition on VHS and DVD that contains all of the 
   bloody footage that's in the Unrated Edition, plus seven minutes of 
   dialogue scenes that Corman originally had edited out to pick up the 
   film's pacing (a practice that Corman utilized frequently). This is 
   the version to get your hands on if you must see this film (which 
   isn't bad, just common), but it is long OOP and goes for big bucks on 
   the collectors' circuit. Jeremy Stanford (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Watchers3">WATCHERS

   (2012) -</B> Here's an urban legend film updated for the Internet 
   Age. The legend is this: If you log into an anonymous chat room, pick 
   a person that you don't know, concentrate real hard and then type 
   &quot;I did it for the lulz&quot; three times (It's Internet speak 
   for &quot;I did it for the laughs.&quot;), a killer named Smiley (who 
   stiched his eyes shut and then stitched a large smile on his face) 
   will appear behind that person and slice their throat or stab them in 
   the heart. We then switch to freshman college student Ashley (Caitlin 
   Gerard; <B><A HREF="awakening_2010.htm">THE AWAKENING</A></B> - 2010, 
   who is very good here), a young female nerd who is trying to get over 
   the suicide of her mother and had to be institutionalized for a short 
   while. Rather than living in a dorm, she moves into a house close to 
   campus with Proxy (Melanie Papalia; <B><A HREF="confined_2010.htm">CONFINED</A></B> 
   - 2010), another young female who is the exact opposite of Ashley. 
   She likes to party and have a good time, where Ashley is rather 
   straight laced. Proxy talks Ashley into going to a party with her 
   (after introducing Ashley<A HREF="smiley_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/smiley 2012 poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="173" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   to the joys of pot) at the house of rich privileged asshole computer 
   hacker Zane (Andrew James Allen). She also meets fellow nerd Binder 
   (Shane Dawson), who is thrown out of the party for ratting out Zane 
   and his friends to campus authorities for their hacking habits (They 
   all call him &quot;PedoBear&quot; and if you don't know what that 
   means, Google it). After getting drunk at the party and watching a 
   video of Smiley in action on one of Zane's computers, Ashley and 
   Proxy go home and log into an anonymous chat room, where Proxy picks 
   a person (a man who is flashing them his penis) and tells Ashley to 
   concentrate really hard (because you have to want it to happen) and 
   type in &quot;I did it for the lulz.&quot; three times. An 
   apprehensive and still-drunk Ashley does it and, sure enough, Smiley 
   appears behind the guy and slits his throat. He then stares directly 
   at the screen with his sewn-shut eyes. This freaks Ashley out, 
   fearing that Smiley now knows who she and Proxy are. Ashley then 
   believes that Smiley is after her (the dreams she has are very vivid) 
   and goes to psychiatrist Dr. Jenkins (Liza Weil; <B><A HREF="stir_of_echoes_1999.htm">STIR
    OF ECHOES</A></B> - 1999), who prescribes her an anti-anxiety drug 
   and threatens to recommit her if she gets worse. She also has 
   discussions with psychology teacher Professor Clayton (an excellent 
   Roger Bart; <B><A HREF="hostel_part_2_2007.htm">HOSTEL PART II</A></B> 
   - 2007), who tells her that all humans in general are doomed to 
   extinction and it is only a matter of time before it happens (it's 
   also refreshing that he never hits on her, except jokingly). I'll 
   leave the rest for you to discover, as it didn't turn out the way I 
   thought it was going to, which is always a plus in my book. For those 
   that don't bother watching the closing credits to a film, I recommend 
   you stay until the end for a stinger that changes everything. 
   Director/co-writer/co-executive producer Michael J. Gallagher (his 
   first theatrical effort, even if it only played for one week before 
   going the DTV route) has created an inventive new character in Smiley 
   (along with co-writer/co-executive producer Glasgow Phillips, who 
   directed the funny Western zombie flick <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#UndeadOrAlive2007">UNDEAD
    OR ALIVE</A></B> - 2007) and fills the film with plenty of jump 
   scares, which are usually nothing but somebody suddenly appearing in 
   frame while the music amps up in volume, but it did manage to make me 
   jump a couple of times (something that most modern horror films don't 
   do to me). The inventive finale really surprised me, but there are 
   clues along the way (especially if you watch it a second time) that 
   doesn't make it seem that it is just coming out of left field, like 
   most modern horror films where the writers and directors don't know 
   how to properly end a film. <B><A HREF="smiley_2012b.htm">SMILEY</A></B> 
   thankfully doesn't suffer that fate (and the stinger after the final 
   credits is also a plus) and Roger Bart as Professor Clayton is such 
   an interesting character, I wish I could go back to college and have 
   him as a teacher. The acting and technical aspects are also above par 
   for such a low-budget film and while there is some blood and gore, it 
   doesn't rely on it to get the point across. In other words, I enjoyed 
   it. It's nothing spectacular, mind you, just an entertaining update 
   of all those urban legends that scared the shit out of us when we 
   were kids. Also starring Keith David (as a police detective who 
   really has nothing to do besides disbelieve everything Ashley tells 
   him), Toby Turner, Jana Winternitz, Nikki Limo, Steve Greene, Richard 
   Ryan and Michael Traynor as Smiley. An <A HREF="http://www.arc-ent.com">Arc

    ON A TRAIN</A><A NAME="SnakesOnATrain"></A> (2006) -</B> Yes, this 
   is another of The Asylum's shameless rip-offs (they prefer you call 
   them &quot;mockbusters&quot;, but c'mon, rip-off is a much better 
   word). If I have to tell you which <A HREF="snakes_on_a_plane_2006.htm">film</A> 
   this is a cheap knock-off of, stop reading now, call-up some friends, 
   have them come over and let them repeatedly kick you in the head. 
   Back to the film: Two illegal Mexican aliens, Brujo (Alby Castro) and 
   the sickly Alma (Julia Ruiz), cross the American border in hopes of 
   finding a better life and a cure for Alma's sickness in Los Angeles. 
   What Alma suffers from, though, is like no sickness you've ever seen, 
   as she and Brujo have to stop often so she can puke up some green 
   liquid, followed by snakes (!), which Brujo collects in mason jars in 
   his backpack (I usually save all my puke, too, and show it to my 
   friends later on.). Alma pukes out a snake that Brujo fails to 
   capture and it bites their Coyote guide, killing him instantly. Brujo 
   and Alma sneak into the baggage car of a train headed for Los 
   Angeles, where a bunch of other illeg<A HREF="snakes_on_a_train_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/snakes on a train dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="183" HEIGHT="263" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>als
    are also hiding out, including Alma's friend Miguel (Giovanni 
   Bejarano). We are then introduced to the train's paying customers, as 
   conductor Frank (Stephen A.F. Day), punches their tickets. It's an 
   anemic passenger list (appropriate with The Asylum's meager budget) 
   that includes two models, Crystal (Amelia Jackson-Gray) and Summer 
   (Shannon Gale); a trio of pot-smoking surfer dudes; a husband, wife 
   and their young daughter; a businessman; a mysterious Middle eastern 
   guy; and a dude in a cowboy hat who jumps on the train just as it 
   leaves the station. Alma's mysterious ailment gets worse (The race is 
   on as to see whether Brujo can get her to Los Angeles in time, as his 
   Uncle there has a cure), but when Brujo gets into a fight with some 
   wetbacks, the snakes in his mason jars are released. Not only are the 
   bites from the snakes deadly, they are also hungry and growing larger 
   by the minute. Brujo thinks he has recaptured all the snakes, but he 
   should tell that to the paying customers, as a few hungry ones have 
   made their way to the passenger cars. Personal dramas mix with snake 
   attack scenes, as we find out that Crystal and Summer are drug mules 
   and cowboy hat dude is a dirty ex-cop following them. The Middle 
   Eastern guy is actually the girls' connection, the snakes begin 
   killing more passengers and Alma transforms into one big-assed snake, 
   which forces all the survivors to disembark in a hurry before she 
   swallows the entire train! Someone get this motherfucking snake off 
   this motherfucking train!&nbsp; As with most of these Asylum flicks, 
   there are long stretches of dialogue that seem to go on forever. 
   Unlike most of these Asylum flicks, there are actually some effective 
   scenes, especially the snake attack scenes. Director Peter Mervis 
   (credited here as &quot;The Mallachi Brothers&quot;), who also made <B><A HREF="dead_men_walking_2005.htm">DEAD
    MEN WALKING</A></B> (2005) and <B><A HREF="when_a_killer_calls_2006.htm">WHEN
    A KILLER CALLS</A></B> (2006) for The Asylum, and screenwriter Eric 
   Forsberg (who also wrote and directed <B><A HREF="alien_abduction_2005.htm">ALIEN
    ABDUCTION</A></B> [2005] and <B><A HREF="night_of_the_dead_2006.htm">NIGHT
    OF THE DEAD</A></B> [2006] for The Asylum) have fashioned a film 
   steeped in Mexican folklore (&quot;Brujo&quot; is Spanish for 
   &quot;witch&quot;) and while it's not completely successful, at least 
   it's different enough from the usual Asylum dreck. The snake attack 
   scenes are gory, as they don't just bite, they burrow under the skin 
   and lay babies (At one point, Brujo rips a guy's heart out with his 
   bare hands and a snake is seen slithering between the exposed 
   valves). There's an awful lot of puking in this film, so if scenes of 
   people retching get your gag reflexes into overdrive, this may not be 
   the film for you. Surprisingly there is very little CGI utilized 
   until the ridiculous finale (where Alma turns into a giant snake and 
   swallows the entire train!), as most of the snake attacks are done 
   with real snakes or practical effects (some very well-done and squirm 
   inducing, especially the little girl being swallowed whole by a huge 
   snake). I'm not saying that this is a good film by any means, but 
   it's a step-up from your usual Asylum production. Biggest blooper: 
   The make and model of the train changes constantly throughout the 
   film. Also starring Isaac Wade, Al Galvez, Madeleine Falk, Derek 
   Osedach, Jason S. Gray, Jay Costelo and Sean Durrie. An <A HREF="http://www.theasylum.cc">Asylum

   (1971/1976) -</B> A group of female bikers chase down one of their 
   own when she holds out on some cocaine (which she snorts through an 
   extremely large straw). They shoot and wound her, then put her feet 
   in stocks. Their Manson-like leader, with the improbable name 
   &quot;Satan&quot; (Enrique Larratelli), orders one of the girls to 
   take a knife and slice her between her toes, which she does. 
   Meanwhile, a girl (disguised <A HREF="snuff_1976b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/snuff ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="194" HEIGHT="138" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>as
    a man), stabs a man in the back, then slits his throat in the mens 
   room of an airport in Buenos Aires, Argentina where movie star Terry 
   London (Mirtha Massa) and her overbearing manager Max Marsh (Aldo 
   Mayo) are arriving so Terry can star in a new movie being filmed 
   there. Terry (who is pregnant) ditches Max and phones new rich 
   boyfriend Horst (Clao Villanueva) to come visit. Satan has a plan to 
   get rid of Max Marsh and get Terry's baby so it can be sacrificed in 
   one of his satanic rituals. Why? I haven't got the foggiest idea. Max 
   and Terry go to Mardi Gras (cue the stock footage) and then a costume 
   ball (more stock footage, please!) where Horst whisks Terri away for 
   some hot sex while Max is viciously stabbed in the heart by one of 
   Satan's girls. Terry is interrogated by the police about Max's death 
   (in one of the shoddiest police sets of all times) and is released in 
   Horst's care. Satan's girls rob a store where they kill the owner, 
   his wife, son and young daughter. The girls, on Satan's orders, 
   invade the house of Horst's father, where they stab or shoot everyone 
   (they may even slice off Horst's manhood, but that's open for debate) 
   and when they get to Terry (who is sleeping with Horst's father!), 
   one of the girls plunges a knife into her pregnant belly. That's when 
   we learn that this was all a film, as the director yells 
   &quot;Cut!&quot; and we then see the actress that played Terry being 
   sliced and sawed apart by her boyfriend in a &quot;real&quot; snuff 
   film, the last shot being her boyfriend holding her intestines in the 
   air and screaming with excitement before the camera runs out of film 
   (but, strangely, not sound).&nbsp; This infamous film, noted for it's 
   violent (but extremely fake) final five minutes, is really quite

   OF THE MUTILATED</A></B> - 1974). This part of the movie, filmed in 
   and around Buenos Aires, is a boring mess that contains terrible 
   post-synch dubbing (not only does Roberta Findlay appear as one of 
   Satan's girls, her unmistakable Brooklyn accent is also on the dub 
   track), some cheap gore effects (where the blood is that bright red 
   early-70's color) and countless scenes of naked women with very small 
   breasts (this was before the augmentation age). The final five 
   minutes are what give this film it's notoriety. Film huckster Allan 
   Shackleton bought <B>THE SLAUGHTER</B> from the Findlays (after an 
   unsuccessful theatrical run), hired Simon Nuchtern (<B><A HREF="#Silent Madness">SILENT
    MADNESS</A></B> - 1984) to direct the finale which purportedly shows 
   the actress who played Terry being slowly killed in an actual snuff 
   film (nevermind that the woman that plays Terry in this sequence 
   looks nothing like actress Mirtha Massa). It's apparent after viewing 
   it that it's fake beyond belief, but Shackleton made sure that word 
   got out that it was real before it was released, which caused a 
   firestorm of protests from various watchdog groups and plenty of 
   attention from the news media, which gave it great success at the 
   boxoffice. This is one of the greatest examples of successful false 
   advertising in the history of film. Forget that the film is basically 
   a dog. Enjoy it for it's history and novelty factor. I did. Blue 
   Underground had a novel way for releasing <B><A HREF="snuff_1976b.htm">SNUFF</A></B> 
   on DVD. The sleeve is nothing but a facsimile of plain brown wrapping 
   paper where there's nothing but the title and the film's original 
   theatrical tag line: &quot;The film that could only be made in South 
   America...where life is CHEAP!&quot; Nothing else, not even a Blue 
   Underground logo. The DVD itself is even simpler: Just a fullscreen 
   print (probably an open matte presentation) with no extras and no 
   chapter stops. As soon as you put the disc in your DVD player, the 
   film begins and when it ends, it starts all over again. A gutsy move 
   on BU's part because it could be considered cheap by those not in on 
   the gag. The film is also devoid of any credits except the title, the 
   same way I remember seeing it in theaters in the mid-70's. This is 
   the film that made the term &quot;snuff film&quot; a part of our 
   vocabulary. The FBI still insists that snuff films don't exist. In 
   today's video age, I have my doubts. A <A HREF="http://www.blue-underground.com">Blue

   obnoxious Americans, in their haste to make it to Paris before 
   nightfall (the Range Rover they are in is in less than stellar 
   condition), make a wrong turn on some backwoods road and end up at an 
   abandoned house where, years before, Nazis would hold decadent, 
   drug-fueled orgies just before the end of World War II. When they

   down and they are forced to stay in the house until help arrives. 
   They use the phone in the house to call for help, but it seems the 
   only number that works is to the local cemetery. It's not long before 
   they are all trapped in the house, as all the windows and doors 
   becomes locked by some supernatural force. Rather than working 
   together to find a way out, they turn on each other, freak out or get 
   drunk, which is the perfect opportunity for Willy to play mind games 
   with each one. He uses such tricks as Russian Roulette, a lesbian 
   Nazi succubus (Zora Kerova) and rape to turn the friends on each 
   other, which results in murder. A canister containing a roll of 16mm 
   film holds the clues as to why this is all happening and the house 
   tries to stop the remaining Americans from viewing it. When they do 
   view it, they suddenly wake up in a cemetery and everyone is alive, 
   the house nothing but a foundation with crumbling walls. They all hop 
   in their car and leave. The End. What the fuck?!?&nbsp; This totally 
   predictable and minor horror film is one of famed director Lucio 
   Fulci's (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#LizardWomansSkin">LIZARD IN A 
   WOMAN'S SKIN</A></B> - 1971; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Zombie">ZOMBIE</A></B> 
   - 1979; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#MurderRock">MURDER ROCK</A></B> - 
   1984) lesser latter-day horror films. While Fulci fills the film with 
   female nudity, the horror elements are hackneyed and uninteresting. 
   What I find most insulting, though, is that Fulci chose to make the 
   victims a bunch of aggravating Americans. It's obvious that most of 
   them are portrayed by Italians, so I can only come up with two 
   conclusions why Fulci made them Americans: The first reason is 
   Americans make the film more likely to be purchased for release in 
   English-speaking territories, but this never got a legal U.S. release 
   on home video. The second reason (and the one I believe to be true) 
   is that Fulci just wanted to make the victims Americans because, in 
   his mind, they are the logical choice to be tortured by the Nazis. 
   For a Fulci flick, the gore is rather sparse (just a pretty gross 
   rapidly-decaying body and a shot of a woman's breasts turning to goo 
   when touched) and, in the orgy scenes, the men keep their pants on 
   when screwing the women. The only scene that generates any suspense 
   is when Willy plays a game of Russian Roulette with Mark (Claudio 
   Aliotti), but even then there's no final payoff. It ends without a 
   single shot being fired. It's also obvious that the screenplay, by 
   Fulci and Carlo Alberto Alfieri, lacked a tangible ending, so they 
   resorted to the tired &quot;it was all a dream&quot; finale. Do 
   yourself a favor and avoid this at all costs because it's apparent 
   Fulci made this without his patented mean streak. His heart 
   definitely wasn't in it. Fulci would use clips from this film in his 
   1990 horror film <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CatInTheBrain">A CAT IN

   Minor slasher film that's a lesser variation of <B><A HREF="slumber_party_massacre_1982.htm">SLUMBER
    PARTY MASSACRE</A></B> (1982), yet both films are intricately linked 
   (both were financed by Roger Corman [who is the uncredited Executive 
   Producer here] and directed and written by women). After a pretty 
   creepy and atmospheric first ten minutes, this film quickly 
   degenerates into standard stalk 'n' slash material. Beth (Angela 
   O'Neill; <B><A HREF="action.htm#EnemyUnseen">ENEMY UNSEEN</A></B> - 
   1989), who is mourning the death of the aunt who raised her, decides 
   to spend time with some female friends at their sorority house to 
   help her overcome her grief. From the moment she steps through the 
   door of the sorority house, Beth is overwhelmed with the feeling that 
   she has been there before, apparently when she was a young girl, but 
   she has no memory of her childhood years due to a traumatic event 
   that she has blocked from her memory. She also begins to have a 
   psychic link with Bobby (John C. Russell), a psychopath in an insane 
   asylum who hasn't spoken a word since he was committed. Until now. He 
   says one single word, &quot;Laura&quot;, kills an orderly and escapes 
   from the asylum. The first thing Bobby does is go to a sporting goods 
   store, grabs a knife, stabs the clerk in t<A HREF="sorority_house_massacre_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/sorority house massacre vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>he
    stomach, steals a car and heads to the sorority house. Beth begins 
   having visions of people being killed in the house, but as we will 
   soon find out, they're not visions at all. They're repressed memories 
   from her childhood. Of course, most of the sorority sisters leave the 
   house for Spring Break, leaving Beth and a handful of girls, along 
   with some horny guys who come over for a night of sex and scary 
   stories, to fend for themselves when Bobby shows up and begins 
   killing them one-by-one. Under hypnosis (performed by one of the 
   sorority sisters, who has taken a psychology class and therefore is 
   an expert at the practice!), we find out that Bobby is actually 
   Beth's brother (no surprise there, as it's telegraphed early on) who 
   murdered his three other young sisters in the house years before. 
   Beth or, rather Laura (Beth is her middle name), escaped the 
   slaughter before Bobby could do her in, too. All her repressed 
   memories come back to Beth like a flash flood and after Bobby kills 
   everyone else in the house, Beth and Bobby face-off in a knife duel 
   to the death. A <B><A HREF="carrie_1976.htm">CARRIE</A></B>-inspired 
   shock ending follows.&nbsp; The first thing you'll notice about this 
   film is that even though it's directed and written by a woman, it's 
   still full of female nudity and bloody violence. This only proves how 
   crafty Roger Coman is as a producer. Feminists couldn't possibly 
   complain about a slasher film being misogynistic when it was directed 
   by a woman, could they? Director/scripter Carol Frank, who worked as 
   an assistant to director Amy Jones on <B>SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE</B> 
   (and never made another film after this), opens the film on a fairly 
   creepy note, with slow-motion tracking shots of the camera gliding 
   through various empty rooms of the sorority house, while Beth has a 
   nightmare of three young girls warning her not to go into the house, 
   ending with Beth walking into the dining room where three creepy 
   dolls are sitting around a table. Unfortunately, the film pretty much 
   goes steadily downhill from there, dissolving into tiresome dialogue 
   scenes of dream interpretation, hypnosis and generic slasher 
   material, where director Frank clearly represents Bobby's constant 
   need to stab things as a metaphor for his pent-up sexual desires. 
   Bobby's motivation for killing his sisters is never overtly revealed, 
   which also diminishes the scare factor. There are a few bloody 
   stabbings, but since all of the deaths are by stabbing, there's no 
   variety to the killings. A good slasher knows when to change-up on 
   the weapons he uses. Like <B>SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE</B>, this film 
   spawned two sequels (the third one, directed by Jim Wynorski, titled <B><A HREF="hard_to_die_1990.htm">HARD
    TO DIE</A></B> [1990] is probably the best in the series) and <B><A HREF="sorority_house_massacre_2_1990.htm">SORORITY
    HOUSE MASSACRE II</A></B> (1990) is padded-out with scenes from the 
   first <B>SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE</B> film, further cementing the 
   relationship between the two series, even if that connection is 
   nothing but Corman's propensity to re-use footage as a cost-cutting 
   measure (In other words, he's cheap). At 74 minutes long (there's 
   rumors of an 86 minute British edit, but I don't recall if anyone has 
   actually seen it), <B><A HREF="sorority_house_massacre_1986b.htm">SORORITY

   where Reed hires scientist Peter Fonda to find out why the snake and 
   him have a psychic link. Of course the snake escapes, thanks to 
   Reed's neice (Kerrie Keene), and it attacks everyone who gets in it's 
   way. The serpent's bite causes the inflicted to swell up and burst, 
   causing gory agony before death. There's also a subplot about a cult 
   of snake-worshippers who try and steal the serpent for their own 
   means. Unfortunately, none of this goes anywhere as the production 
   ran out of money before they could film the finale and the movie is 
   stuffed with too many POV shots and scenes are repeated over and over 
   to pad out the running time. The finale is so sudden, that it makes 
   the bulk of the film seem moot. There are a few positives: The late 
   Al Waxman's death in a van is juicy (thanks to makeup artist 
   extrodinairre Dick Smith), the snake attack scene while a girl is 
   taking a shower is suspenseful and some scenes do build up tension. 
   There's also a song by Tangerine Dream made expressly for this film. 
   But the negatives outweigh the positives. When we finally do get a 
   look at the serpent, it's laughable, looking like a relative of <B><A HREF="reptilicus_1961.htm">REPTILICUS</A></B>

   homeless and the nuclear power controversy (a major subject during 
   the 70's) and the effects that they both had on society. The 
   creature, in other words, was a product of our ignorance and 
   inability to control what we try to harness. Along the way, we 
   witness the 70's phenomenons known as turtle racing, swingers, disco 
   music and funky fashions (Did I really dress like that? I like to

   formidable sight, but doesn't carry much screen time during the first 
   sixty minutes. Still, this is not a film for the kiddies, as Traxler 
   fills the screen with plenty of adult material, especially during the

   being attacked by rats and then killed when her car mysteriously 
   blows up when she tries to escape the house). Almost immediately

    her. Will's videotape footage of their move is distorted and shows a 
   mysterious aura surrounding Aubrey. Maura's nerves are shaken when 
   something keeps moving the furniture in the blink of an eye. When 
   Will and Maura are awakened by Aubrey's screams and discover a 
   semi-transparent demon looming over Aubrey's bed, they hire 
   parapsychologist Dr. Edward Shea (Dick Donaghue) and his assistant 
   Amy Wolfe (Mary Kate Ryan) to come to the house and find out just 
   what in the hell is going on. Dr. Shea discovers that a young girl 
   named Colleen was murdered in the house and when a possessed Aubrey 
   leads them to her body, which was hidden behind a brick wall in the 
   basement, they give Colleen's body a proper burial in the town 
   cemetery and believe their haunting problems are now over. Far from 
   it. At dinner that night, all hell breaks loose. The turkey dinner 
   takes on a life of it's own, Dr. Shea is decapitated when he runs

   possessed by an evil force and has taken Aubrey to replace Colleen.

   back, but their problems are far from over. The evil now possesses 
   Maura and it uses Maura's fears of Will's continued cheating to make 
   her believe that Will is having an affair with Amy, which drives a 
   wedge into an already unstable marriage. Will must find a way to snap 
   Maura out of the supernatural hold she is under before she kills

   set-pieces, including the opening scene of the maid perishing in her 
   car; the dinner where the turkey being served becomes the aggressor; 
   and the sequence where they find Colleen's body. The film does fall 
   apart in the final third (the house fire that closes the film is as 
   cheap and fake-looking as you'll ever see) and Brendan Broderick's 
   screenplay does depend too much on haunted house clich&eacute;s 
   (disembodied moaning; objects flying through the air and crashing 
   against the wall), but the beautiful Ireland location photography, 
   nudity and bloodletting makes for a mildly diverting 83 minutes of 
   supernatural thrills. The cast does well with what they're given to 
   do and first-timer Briana Evigan is surprisingly good as a child 
   under constant danger. She may have gotten the role because she was 
   Greg Evigan's daughter, but she acquits herself nicely. Also starring

    WARRIOR: SPECIAL COMBAT UNIT</A></B> - 1989), opens with notorious 
   albino serial killer Adam Brandis (Zagarino), who is better known as 
   &quot;The Spiker&quot; (for his penchant for dispatching his victims 
   with railroad spikes), escaping after being transferred from prison 
   (where he has spent the last twenty years) to a rehabilitation 
   facility when a judge determines he can become a productive member of 
   society. Won't these liberals ever learn? After jumping off the ferry 
   transporting him to the hospital, Brandis disappears, much to the 
   chagrin of Sheriff Paxton (Lou Martini Jr.), who was a rookie cop 
   when Brandis slaughtered 27 citizens in the town he is now in charge 
   of protecting. The Police Search and Rescue Squad determines that 
   Brandis has drowned, but Sheriff Paxton (and the audience) knows 
   better. Brandis walks out of the water and kills a man who is 
   (conveniently) repairing a dock using railroad spikes, so the Spiker 
   now has all the equipment he needs to go on another killing spree. He 
   then walks the rails of a railroad track until he comes to an old 
   deserted house from his past, which is now (conveniently) being used 
   as Party <A HREF="spiker_2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/spiker dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Central
    by three teenage jocks and their cheerleading girlfriends (who don't 
   bother changing out of their cheerleading outfits until they get to 
   the house!). One of the girls, Nikki (Ginger Kroll), is 
   (conveniently) the niece of Sheriff Paxton's deputy, Scott McLean 
   (Mike Fedele). Another one of the girls, Lisa (Giselle Rodriguez), 
   whose dead aunt, Elizabeth Shaw, (conveniently) use to live in the 
   deserted house, seems to have some type of psychic link to the 
   Spiker, especially after the third girl, goth chick Erin (Linda 
   Johnson), holds a s&eacute;ance to contact Lisa's dead aunt. It seems 
   that Elizabeth died the same day and year Lisa was born and, get 
   this, it was also Elizabeth's wedding day (Would someone please stop 
   all these convenient coincidences before my head falls off?). It's 
   not long before Lisa is being visited by the ghost of her dead aunt 
   (still dressed in her bridal gown) and the groundskeeper (Why would a 
   deserted house need a groundskeeper?), a creepy guy named Clive 
   Grendel (David 'Shark' Fralick), warns the horny teenagers to leave 
   the house immediately. Do they listen? Of course not. As Lisa begins 
   to slowly (and I do mean slowly) uncover the truth about the 
   mysterious wedding day death of her aunt, Brandis goes into full 
   Spiker mode, first killing Erin's boyfriend, Gary (Adam Shonkwiler), 
   by planting a spike through his neck and another one through the back 
   of his head until it protrudes out of his forehead and then turning 
   his attention to Erin, throwing a spike into the back of her neck. 
   The other four teens try to escape (conveniently, it's a dead zone 
   for cell phone service), but the Spiker disables their truck by 
   tossing Gary's severed head onto the engine. A long-dormant secret 
   involving involving Elizabeth and Brandis may be the key to stopping 
   Brandis from repeating a crime from the past, but the question 
   remains: Who will survive before Deputy McLean and Sheriff Paxton 
   arrive on the scene? It all ends on a rather depressing (and 
   convenient) note that sets everything up for the inevitable 
   sequel.&nbsp; While it does have it's share of gory kills, <B><A HREF="spiker_2008b.htm">SPIKER</A></B> 
   is nothing more than a crappy &quot;teens in peril&quot; horror flick 
   that offers nothing new to the genre other than the killer's weapon 
   of choice. Zagarino the actor wisely chooses to make is character a 
   man of few words, so there's no jokey dialogue as he dispatches the 
   cast and he does make for an imposing figure with his long white 
   hair, red eyes and pale skin, but Zagarino the director (this is his 
   third directorial effort, following the impossible-to-find <B>FIST 
   FIGHTER 2</B> [1993] and <B><A HREF="never_look_back_2000.htm">NEVER

   Preston Jr.'s (<B><A HREF="dark_breed_1996.htm">DARK BREED</A></B> - 
   1996) screenplay is mostly tired teen clich&eacute;s wrapped around a 
   mystery a five year-old could solve. The blood and gore flow rather 
   freely during the final forty minutes, including spikes being driven 
   and thrown in nearly every body part and a nasty death by axe, but 
   the plot is so common, I can hardly recommend this to anyone but 
   diehard slasher fanatics who must see every slasher film ever made. <B>SPIKER</B> 
   technical qualities are very poor (although I did like how some of 
   the local actors didn't try to disguise their Long Island accents and 
   there's a pretty good CGI shot of Zagarino throwing a spike at Lisa 
   in the finale) and there's nothing here that hasn't been done at

   First a little history on this film: When director Richard W. Haines 
   finished shooting and editing this film in 1981, it clocked-in at a 
   measly 65 minutes and no distributor would touch it. Over the next 
   couple of years, Haines and his team shot an additional 14 minutes of 
   footage and Troma Films picked it up for distribution in 1984 in two 
   versions: a 78-minute R-Rated version and a 79-minute Unrated version 
   (This was actually the first Unrated VHS tape I purchased [from <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Vestron Video">Vestron
    Video</A>] and I still own it to this day). Lloyd Kaufman gave 
   himself an &quot;Associate Producer&quot; credit (Which means he 
   did...nothing) and he and Kaufman (using the pseudonym &quot;Samuel 
   Weil&quot;) would co-direct <B><A HREF="class_of_nuke_em_high_1986.htm">CLASS

   in 1989 (Better known for filming in 35mm three-strip Technicolor, a 
   process that wasn't used for years. Even the VHS versions of the film 
   looked fantastic.). He would direct about a dozen more films (and I 
   wish he would direct more), but he is a walking film encyclopedia. I 
   use to talk to him a lot on a film forum that is hardly in use today 
   (if you go to the forum, you can actually see tumbleweeds blow across 
   your computer screen) until some people would be confrontational 
   towards him (some people just can't take others being smarter than 
   they are) and made his life as difficult as possible, so he was 
   either banned or just quit. Like me, he didn't suffer fools gladly 
   and never held back, giving the offenders both barrels (Just for 
   information: I was banned from that forum, too.) and always spoke his 
   mind. Maybe that is why I appreciate the man. But this is a review 
   site and I don't kiss ass because I like someone, but I have to say 
   that even with all the gaffes, this is an extremely bloody and 
   quick-moving slasher film and not bad for a freshman effort (I 
   suppose it would be made into a &quot;found footage&quot; flick 
   today, because most freshmen directors of this new generation can't 
   afford high-end digital cameras or musicians for a soundtrack). While 
   I would hardly call this film good, it rises head and shoulders above 
   most DTV slasher films today and the blood flows like wine very often 
   (especially in the Unrated version; I have never watched the R-Rated 
   version for a comparison). Back then, the MPAA were real bastards to 
   independent films, while most films from major companies would get a 
   pass. The MPAA would never tell the independents what to edit out to 
   achieve an R-Rating, so sometimes they would cut out a few frames 
   from each kill and other times they would edit a kill out completely. 
   You had to fly by the seat of your pants. Imagine this: If Quentin 
   Tarantino's <B><A HREF="kill_bill_1&amp;2.htm">KILL BILL</A></B> 
   (2003) were released by an independent, do you think the film would 
   have received an R-Rating? Especially with all the limbs being cut 
   off and blood flowing like geysers? I highly doubt it. But I 
   digress... Paranoid schzophrenic William Grayham (Who some orderlies 
   in the end call &quot;Daniel&quot;. I guess three years of filming 
   can make you forget.) has escaped his cell at a mental institution 
   and since he is considered homicidal, it results in a lockdown and a 
   building-wide search (We watch a patient give a mannequin head and 
   then himself the &quot;two finger eye-poke&quot;, one of a few Three 
   Stooges tributes in this film, but you really have to look and listen 
   for them). Grayham stabs an orderly in the groin when he finds him 
   hiding in a janitor's closet, and he strips the orderly naked (we see 
   the orderly laying up against a sink, his underwear all bloody) and 
   puts on his clothes, covering up the bloody crotch on the pants with 
   a lab coat, leaving the building.&nbsp; &quot;<B>St. Trinians 
   College, three years later:</B>&quot; Teacher Janet Phillips (Donna 
   Hartman) is working late in her empty classroom when there is a knock 
   at her door. She opens the door and a hand holding a knife stabs 
   Janet in the heart, her blood spilling everywhere. &quot;<B>St. 
   Trinians College, the next semester, yesterday...</B>&quot; (Now what 
   the fuck does that mean?). New teacher Julie Parker (Francine Forbes) 
   is interviewing for the position that Janet Phillips held with 
   wheelchair bound school headmaster Father Janson (Dick Biel). He 
   tells her all about what happened to Janet and that some applicants 
   walked out of the interview when he told them the truth. He likes 
   Julie because she is not superstitious and hires her. Julie rents an 
   apartment and gets the skinny of all the killings from her busybody 
   landlady that have been happening in town, not just Janet's. We then 
   see a bunch of teenage punks having arguments with their chicks and 
   Cathy (Kathy Lacommare) heads to her dorm room when the guys go to 
   score some drugs. On her first day of teaching, Julie is being 
   monitored by Father Perkins (director Haines, here using the name 
   &quot;Rick Haines&quot;) when one of the wiseass students says they 
   should talk about the new anti-abortion bill and Julie reluctantly 
   agrees since all of the other students (who treat Julie like she has 
   the plague) stay silent. After class is over, Julie is in Father 
   Janson's office getting her ass chewed-out over her choice of 
   subjects (this is a Catholic college) because she was ratted out by 
   Father Perkins. She notices Father Janson's hands twitching, as his 
   fingernails tap on his desktop. Doreen (Joanna Mihalakis) leaves the 
   local diner, gets in her car and Grayham slices her across the top of 
   her forehead and throws her in a dumpster. Julie asks fellow teacher 
   Mark (Ric Randig) about what really happened to Janet and he tells 
   her the truth (except for one vital bit of information), even going 
   as far as to say he believes the killer works at the college. When 
   Julie gets back to her apartment, her nosy landlady hands her a 
   package addressed to her, which she thinks is strange since she 
   hasn't had time to tell anyone her new address. When she opens the 
   package, it is filled with religious books and pamphlets, which she 
   drops to the floor and goes to sleep. &quot;<B>Three weeks later:</B>&quot;
    Julie feels as if her class is conspiring against her. She is also 
   now dating Mark. Cathy tells Julie that she is pregnant and Julie 
   tells her the best thing to do is talk to Father Janson. Cathy and 
   Tom (Ken Gershon; who doesn't know Cathy is pregnant) go to a 
   drive-in movie (&quot;Nine Bucks? I just want to watch the movie, not 
   own it!&quot;) and Grayham shines a flashlight into their car. Tom 
   gets out to confront the stranger, but when he doesn't come back, 
   Cathy gets out of the car to go look for him. Grayham bloodily slits 
   Cathy's throat and when Tom returns to the car, he finds Cathy's 
   blood-soaked body inside. There are enough red herrings in this film 
   to fill up a sardine can (I haven't even told you about Father 
   Williams [Dan Eaton] and his predilection for schoolgirls), but when 
   Cynthia (Laura Gold) tells Julie that Mark was dating Janet when she 
   was killed, Julie becomes outraged and, with Cynthia's help, breaks 
   into Mark's apartment, where she finds a locked drawer full of 
   newspaper headlines about Janet and the unknown killer. Julie manages 
   to escape Mark's apartment just in time before he comes back, but he 
   looks out the window when he sees that his desk was messed with and 
   sees Cynthia driving Julie away. When the students complain that one 
   of the bathrooms is locked, Julie uses her keys and everyone is 
   shocked to see the bloody corpse of Cynthia. Is Mark the killer or is 
   he being set up? In quick succession, a teacher taking a pee in the 
   ladies room is graphically stabbed to death in a stall. Student 
   Denise (Denise Texera) is stabbed in her mouth when she opens her 
   bedroom closet. When Mark tries to call Julie, she keeps hanging up 
   on him. Julie calls Father Janson and tells him she thinks she knows 
   who the killer is, so the good Father says he will <A HREF="splatter_university_1981-1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/splatter university australia dvd front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="240" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>leave
    a side door open for her so she can enter the college and talk to 
   him in his office. Mark shows up at Julie's door and she has to knee 
   him in the nuts and hit him over the head with a vase. Mark was 
   trying to tell her something important, but Julie doesn't give him 
   the chance, as she hops in her car and heads to the college. When 
   Julie makes it to Father Janson's office, she quickly discovers that 
   he is actually William Grayham, as he gets out of his wheelchair, 
   pulls out a knife hidden in the handle of a huge crucifix that hangs 
   on his wall and tries to use it on Julie. Julie is forced to kick him 
   in the crotch and she runs away, with Janson/Grayham holding his 
   balls while chasing her (this got a good laugh from me). Mark arrives 
   at the college, but can't find an open door to get inside. Julie 
   hides in a ladies room, but discovers the bloody corpse of the 
   teacher (You have to freeze-frame to see that her intestines are in 
   her lap while she is sitting on the throne and there's &quot;Though 
   We Walk&quot; written in her blood on the wall.). Julie screams when 
   she sees the terrible sight and has to leave the ladies room. Julie 
   takes a freight elevator to the bottom floor and as the door opens 
   Janson/Grayham is waiting for her and uses his crucifix knife to stab 
   her in the lower back and pushes the knife upwards towards her neck, 
   killing her (quite a shocking surprise for a heroine to get killed in 
   a slasher film in the early-80's). Mark finally discovers the open 
   door and finds Julie's dead body in the elevator. Father Janson gets 
   back in his wheelchair and calls the police, saying he heard a woman 
   scream. Mark talks to Father Janson when he notices a single stream 
   of blood on the wall coming from the crucifix. We next see William 
   Grayham in a strait-jacket and a rubber room (This is where one of 
   the orderlies mistakenly calls him &quot;Daniel&quot; Grayham instead 
   of William. He also makes the mistake of saying Willian 
   &quot;Daniel&quot; Grayham worked at St. Trinians College for two 
   years, when it clearly stated in the beginning of the film that he 
   has been there three years.) The film ends with William Grayham 
   railing against women and how they ruined his life.&nbsp; Besides 
   some sloppy dialogue (full of timeline errors), boom mike 
   appearances, reflections of the crew in windows and flubbed lines (In 
   Haines' defense, he was supposed to have free use at Mercy College in 
   Dobbs Ferry, NY during Spring Break for two weeks, but the school cut 
   it down to one week, so Haines had to make do with a lot of first 
   takes when filming at the school.), the movie moves quickly and there 
   is plenty of blood and gore. Even with all the mistakes, this is a 
   pretty good freshman effort and Haines has nothing to be ashamed of 
   here. Be aware that the old DVD from Elite Entertainment was the 
   R-Rated version in widescreen, but the Amazon &quot;exclusive 
   digitally remastered&quot; DVD and streamed versions (the way I 
   watched it) are the Unrated version, look to be sourced from tape 
   masters and are in fullscreen, so you'll have to pick your own poison 
   (I'll take the Unrated edition any day). Co-screenwriters John Elias

   (Felix Ward), summons a divergent group of people to his crumbling 
   mansion with the express purpose of reanimating his long-dead love, 
   Isabelle (Maria Pechukas). The group of people include four teenage 
   punks, four button-down business types and thirteen year-old runaway 
   Billy (Alec Nemser). After fooling around with an ouija board, one of 
   the girls is possessed and turns into an old hag. Another guy is 
   pulled underground in a graveyard and the rest are trapped in the 
   mansion when the dead rise from the graveyard outside. Also making 
   life difficult for the group is Kreon's servant (Dan Scott), a 
   creature with a hook on one arm and a cat-like paw on the other (he 
   purrs when around Kreon, who calls him &quot;My Kitty&quot;). Kitty 
   savagely slashes Billy across the face and buries him alive. The 
   group is attacked by farting Muck Men carrying pickaxes (they are 
   eventually dissolved in wine), one girl is bitten by a small lizard 
   creature (it looks like a <B><A HREF="ghoulies_1985.htm">GHOULIES</A> </B>reject),
    one girl is dissolved (via stop-motion animation) by a monster with 
   an exposed heart, a statue of the Grim Reaper comes to life and 
   slashes some people and a Chinese lady turns into a spider woman and 
   sucks the life out of another guy. The film concludes with a 
   reanimated Isabelle killing Kreon and then being chased by a bunch of 
   zombies in a graveyard. She gets away, thanks to a good samaritan who 
   picks her up in a car, only to find out that Kreon is not dead. 
   Confused? Join the club.&nbsp; If you need to know why the film seem 
   so disjointed, it's because <B><A HREF="spookies_1985b.htm">SPOOKIES</A></B> 
   is actually two different unfinished films were stitched together 
   (Thomas Doran and Brendan Faulkner's <B>TWISTED SOULS</B> and Eugenie 
   Joseph's <B>GOBLIN</B>) to form this abomination. The film is a total 
   washout except for some good old-fashioned makeup effects. This is 
   nothing more than a series of makeup effects set pieces, some good 
   (the spider woman transformation; the final zombie attack) and some 
   bad (the lizard creature; the fart monsters). The effects come 
   courtesy of Arnold Gargiulo, Vincent Guastini, Gabe Bartalos and 
   Jennifer Aspinal, all excellent artists, but one gets the impression 
   that there wasn't a lot of prep time involved (the opticals are 
   especially weak). Another clue that the film suffered a lot of post-production
    tinkering is Billy's story. The film opens with runaway Billy 
   celebrating his thirteenth birthday alone. We get involved in his 
   character only to have him buried alive a few minutes later and we 
   never see him again. Here's another sign of trouble: It had twelve 
   assistant editors. Even they couldn't salvage a story with the 
   footage that they had because the finale makes absolutely no sense 
   and it leaves the fate of three characters up in the air. Do yourself 
   a favor and let this one pass you by. Too many cooks made a meal no

   ski mask) who is watching their every move. The mystery killer 
   disrupts the treasure hunters' next outing on the lake by trying to 
   run them over in a power boat, even throwing dynamite into the water! 
   Prima (his character's name in unpronouncable, so I'm just gonna call 
   him &quot;Prima&quot;) gives chase in his boat, which results in the 
   mystery killer crashing the power boat into the jagged rocks on 
   shore, the boat exploding into a fireball. The three treasure hunters 
   recover a huge wooden crate from the lake and when they open it, all 
   they find is a rotting human body, which they intend to turn over to 
   the police the next day (Nina has a nightmare that night that three 
   corpses rise from the lake, carry her to the crate, then throw her in 
   it and close the lid). A bad thunderstorm blows in which forces Nina, 
   Kristy and Bonno to abandon their tent and stay with the treasure 
   hunters in the cabin. It's at this time that the shit hits the fan. 
   When Kristy goes to take a shower, the killer splits her head open 
   with an axe. The killer then slams Bonno's head under the hood of a 
   Land Rover and then uses the Land Rover to run over the Boss. Johan 
   gets speargunned and Prima gets impaled with a pitchfork. All that is 
   left is Nina, who gets a visit from another female friend, who turns 
   out to be the killer (she's the Mrs. Vorhees of this film). She 
   relates a story to Nina (told in flashback) about her involvement of 
   the murdered body in the crate and how she tried to cover it up by 
   putting the body in the lake. Since the body has been discovered, she 
   has no choice but to kill everyone who saw it. She then goes after 
   Nina with a machete, but Nina fights back and defeats her attacker 
   with a machete blow to the heart (I guess the filmmakers couldn't 
   afford a decapitation).&nbsp; This slow-moving horror film, directed 
   by Sisworo Gautama Putra (<B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Primitives">PRIMITIVES</A></B>

   happen, Putra pulls away instead of showing the violence, which is 
   strange considering the graphic bloodshed shown in his other films. 
   Kristy's death by axe is only shown as shadows on a wall, Bonno's<A HREF="srigala_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/srigala vcd front small2.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="172" HEIGHT="175" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>

    OF NINJA</A></B> - 1984) get killed, we do see his body impaled on a 
   pitchfork later on. As with most Indonesian exploitation films, there 
   are a couple of &quot;What The Fuck?&quot; moments, one of them being 
   when Nina and Kristy begin fighting each other like two kung-fu 
   masters (complete with exaggerated sound effects) for no apparent 
   reason that I could discern (again, I don't speak the language, so I 
   could have missed something). That scene does set up the finale, 
   where Nina takes on the mystery woman. I dare you not to laugh at 
   Nina's sudden changeover from victim to victor. After being 
   uncerimoniously slapped around and abused, she then takes a martial 
   arts stance and proceeds to beat the crap out of her attacker and 
   then stabs her in the heart just to make sure we know she means

   is Grefe's first stab at a horror film and it's a lulu. Teens in 
   bikini's grooving poolside while Neil Sedaka sings &quot;Do The 
   Jellyfish&quot; (Sedaka, who never appears on-screen here, actually 
   co-stars in 1965's <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#PlaygirlKiller1965">PLAYGIRL

   plenty of beautiful Florida Everglades photography and a walking 
   jellyfish monster whose tentacles cause the film's title, so what 
   more could you ask for? The film opens with Ruth, a buxom blonde in a 
   black bikini seemingly without a care in the world, who is listening 
   to a portable radio where a newscaster announces that the police are 
   baffled as to why fishermen have been disappearing off the coast of 
   South Florida. Poor Ruth is about to discover the reason why, as the 
   jellyfish monster is slowly sneaking up one her as she sunbathes on a 
   dock, reaching up out of the water, pulling her under (the monster 
   also has hands, something real jellyfish lack!) and dragging her 
   lifeless body by her hair to it's lair. It seems Ruth was the 
   assistant to Dr. Richardson (Jack Nagle) and Dr. John Hoyt (Joe 
   Morrison), who are on a <A HREF="death_curse_of_tartu_sting_of_death_dvd.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/death curse of tartu-sting of death dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="318" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>secluded
    island doing experiments on marine life (hmmm...I wonder if those 
   experiments have anything to do with jellyfish?). Dr. Richardson 
   beautiful daughter Karen (Valerie Hawkins) arrives on the island with 
   four equally beautiful female friends, who get a jolt when Dr. 
   Richardson's facially deformed assistant, Egon (John Vella), makes a 
   sudden appearance (something he does a lot in this film). Sheriff Bob 
   (Robert Stanton) shows up by boat and has something to show both the 
   doctors: The dead body of one of the missing fisherman that John 
   thinks was stung by a Portuguese Man-O-War, but the sting marks are 
   much too big for any jellyfish he has seen. Egon believes it is 
   possible to cultivate a jellyfish that size, but Dr. Richardson, John 
   and Sheriff Bob ignore him (they shouldn't). A bunch of wild grad 
   students show up by boat for a pool party in Karen's honor (they all 
   start doing the Twist and the Frug as soon as they set foot on the 
   dock, while the cameramen make sure to get plenty of tight shots of 
   women shaking their asses!), where they all make fun of Egon's 
   deformities (over Karen and John's objections) before he escapes on 
   an airboat and the partygoers form a conga line to the pool. By this 
   time, it's apparent to the viewers (if not the cast) that Egon, who 
   has the hots for Karen, has been performing illicit experiments on 
   himself at his secret underwater lair and that he's actually the 
   jellyfish monster. The monster Egon (portrayed by Doug Hobart, who 
   played Tartu in <B>DEATH CURSE OF TARTU</B>, which was shot 
   back-to-back with this) plans on getting even with the partygoers, 
   hiding in the pool (toss all rationality out the window because no 
   one sees his big black body in the clear pool water!) while everyone 
   dances to Neil Sedaka's &quot;Do The Jellyfish&quot; (&quot;Monkey, 
   don't be a donkey. It's nothing like the Monkey! It isn't funky or 
   anything that's junky! It's something swella! The jilla-jalla 
   Jellyfish!&quot; Oh...my...god!). Louise (Sandy Lee Kane) jumps in 
   the pool and is attacked by the jellyfish man (who looks like a man 
   in a wetsuit, flippers and an inflated clear plastic garbage bag over 
   his head!), who then capsizes the partygoers' boat as they try to 
   escape and killing them all by releasing jellyfish into the water. 
   With the radio on the island destroyed (I wonder who did that?), Dr. 
   Richardson, John, Karen and her female friends must fight off the 
   Egon/jellyfish man, while Karen and John fall in love. Uh, oh, 
   jellyfish man no likey!&nbsp; Unlike <B>TARTU</B>, the bloodletting 
   in William Grefe's <B><A HREF="sting_of_death_1965.htm">STING OF DEATH</A></B> 
   is kept to a minimum and suffers because of it. The jellyfish man is 
   also a ridiculously cheap creation and is about as scary as seeing 
   your grandmother without her teeth in (thankfully, the monster isn't 
   fully revealed until the finale). Fortunately, the fullscreen print 
   Something Weird Video uses for their DVD (a double feature with <B>TARTU</B>)
    is vibrant, sharp and colorful, which makes all the underwater and 
   Everglades scenery really &quot;pop&quot; and the brightly-colored 
   60's fashions stand out (Did I really dress like that? Why yes, I 
   did!). There's really not much meat to Al Dempsey's screenplay

   a short time later. A young girl, Gail (Zoe Carides), who lives in 
   the development does an investigation and finds out that all the 
   houses were built on a sacred Aboriginal burial ground, the site of a 
   mass murder of young Aborigines by the White man a hundred years

   fight the witchdoctor's evil powers. After a couple of close calls

    STROKES</A></B> [1984 - 1986]?) for directions to the next town 
   where they are supposed to play a gig. Little Joe tells Nigel that he 
   knows a shortcut (any directions that end with &quot;Go left on 
   Crystal Lake Road&quot; is not a good sign) and a one-armed man 
   (Charles Klausmeyer; <B><A HREF="unnamable_2_1992.htm">THE UNNAMABLE II</A></B>

   case you were born in a vacuum, the directions turn out to be totally 
   bogus and van driver Kiel nearly hits a dog in the middle of the 
   road, forcing him to crash the van into the forest (this is also when 
   they discover Little Joe never filled their tank with gas and, 
   wouldn't you know it, there is no cellphone service where they are). 
   After sleeping in the van that night, they head out on foot looking 
   for some help, but not before all the girls go skinnydipping in a 
   pond, but Kiel won't let Nikki go in because she's a &quot;lesbo who 
   wants to fuck Tammy&quot; (Nikki doesn't go in because Kiel is 
   right!). The girls are being watched by some unseen grunting psycho 
   and while Nigel is taking a shit in the woods and Kiel is keeping a 
   close eye on Tammy, someone kidnaps Nikki. She ends up in the 
   basement of a nearby house, where a psychopath is sharpening his axe 
   on a foot-powered grindstone and then uses it to chop-off one of 
   Nikki's feet, which he places in a shoebox! Tammy and Kiel go looking 
   for Nikki (now there's a bright decision!) and it's not long before 
   the bickering couple are attacked by Little Joe and Billy (Jake 
   Hames). Kiel gets a hatchet planted in his back and Tammy escapes to 
   warn her friends. Luckily, Nigel has a .45 pistol in his possession (<B>Kim</B>:
    &quot;Whoa, Phil Spector, where did you get that?&quot; <B>Nigel</B>:
    &quot;Oddly enough, Phil Spector!&quot;), but before he can get a 
   shot off, he gets face-planted by Little Joe's flying hatchet. The 
   girls are now on their own, with only their wits, tits and a .45 to 
   protect them. Who will survive and what will be left of them (I'm 
   sorry, I just had to say that!)?&nbsp; This is an average DTV horror 
   flick that has a few funny one-liners and some laugh-out-loud 
   original songs, but the characters, both heroes and villains, are far 
   too one-dimensional. Little Joe has a &quot;funny&quot; quip to say 
   after every killing (When he kills Nigel with the hatchet, he screams 
   out, &quot;What's the matter, you don't like heavy metal?&quot; That 
   groan you just heard was mine.) and Billy communicates by barking and 
   acting like a dog. Little Joe and Billy's mentor, Coach (Larry 
   Wyatt), is the one with the serious foot fetish. He murders his 
   victims by chopping off their feet and adding them to his shoebox 
   collection (Why does he do it? Why, he's got mother issues! I know, 
   it makes no sense to me either). Really? Is this how desperate horror 
   films have become? The blood and gore doesn't really start until the 
   film's second half, where you will see the aforementioned foot 
   amputations; a manual disembowelment; a drumstick to the eye; death 
   by electric guitar; the one-armed man explaining (in flashback) how 
   he lost his arm; decapitation by guitar string; death by a circular 
   saw blade-firing crossbow; and Coach's death, which must be seen to 
   be disbelieved (if any more CGI was used, he would be totally 
   animated!). <B><A HREF="stump_the_band_2006b.htm">STUMP THE BAND</A></B> 
   (well, at least the title does have some ring of truth to it, 
   although no member of the actual band loses an appendage, but nearly

    SUBSTITUTE (VIKAREN)</A><A NAME="SubstituteVikaren06"></A> (2006) -</B> 
   In this Dutch horror comedy, an alien from a planet that is always at 
   war comes to Earth as a small glowing orb and enters the body of Ulla 
   Harms (Paprika Steen), a substitute teacher who is assigned to a new 
   class of 6th Grade students, including Carl (Jonas Wandschneider), 
   who just lost his mother in a car crash; new student Rikke (Emma Juel 
   Justesen), who just moved into town with her mother; class clown 
   Albert (Jakob Fals Nysgaard); class know-it-all Lotte (Mollie Maria 
   Gilmartin); and bullies Tobias (Andreas Gram Nielsen) and Malthe 
   (Mathias Peter Kjaer). The alien Miss Ulla has come to Earth to learn 
   about human emotions such as love, since the word and concept is 
   (ahem) alien to their race (What does the alien do before it enters 
   the body of Ulla? Why, it knocks-out, but doesn't kill, Ulla's 
   chicken farmer husband with a shotgun blast to the head!). The school 
   principal informs the class that Ulla will be giving them a series of 
   EU-sanctioned tests and if everyone passes them, they will all be 
   going on a trip to Paris. Carl is forced to see school psychiatrist 
   Claus (co-writer Henrik Prip), because Carl has become introverted 
   since his mother's death, but Carl thinks it is useless and pretty 
   much makes<A HREF="substitute_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/substitute 2006 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="280" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   his views known to Claus. Ulla proves to be a most unorthodox 
   substitute teacher, calling all the students &quot;stupid&quot; and 
   making fun of their physical and mental attributes (She says to the 
   buck-toothed Albert, &quot;Make sure your teeth don't scrape the 
   floor!&quot;).The alien Ulla also has the power to put words in kids' 
   mouths and can read their minds, which particularly disturbs Carl 
   (who thought there was something wrong with Ulla the first time he 
   met her), since all he ever thinks about is his mother and he may 
   actually hear his mother talking to him from Heaven warning him about 
   Ulla's motives. Ulla takes pleasure in psysically and mentally 
   torturing the students, especially Carl (she makes fun of his 
   mother's death), because it is the only way she can learn about human 
   emotions, such as empathy and sympathy. The parents of the students 
   are up in arms about Ulla's treatment of their kids and during a 
   school meeting of parents and teachers, Carl discovers who Ulla 
   really is when he spots her creating a clone of the Education 
   Minister out of a ball of some alien material. While the fake 
   Education Minister assures the worried parents that nothing is wrong, 
   Carl gets his hands on some alien documents from Ulla's briefcase and 
   takes pictures of them with his camera phone. Can Carl convince his 
   classmates and his author father Jesper (Ulrich Thomsen) that Ulla is 
   an alien before it is too late? A photo which shows all the students 
   at the chicken farm looking up at the sky (a photo none of the 
   children ever posed for) holds the clues Carl and the students need 
   to unlock the mystery. Everything comes to a head when Ulla takes the 
   children (and Jesper) on a bus ride to Paris and they make an 
   unscheduled stop at the chicken farm. Carl must try to destroy the 
   alien ball before they are all sent to Ulla's planet, where they are 
   to be used for God knows what.&nbsp; This is a pretty good horror 
   comedy that is not only very scary in spots, it also says a lot about 
   humanity in general and how we can be easily fooled into compliance 
   as long as we are assured by authority figures that nothing (or 
   something) is wrong (Tea Party anyone?). Director/co-writer Ole 
   Bornedal (who also gave us the original <B><A HREF="nattevagten_1994.htm">NATTEVAGTEN</A></B> 
   - 1994, as well as the American remake <B><A HREF="nightwatch_1997.htm">NIGHTWATCH</A></B> 
   - 1997 and <B><A HREF="possession_2012.htm">THE POSSESSION</A></B> - 
   2012) shows us how easily manipulated parents can be when it comes to 
   their children's welfare. Rather than believing their children, the 
   parents would rather take stock in the words of their adult 
   counterparts at school (who are like surrogate parents when the kids 
   are away from home). Bornedal wraps this parable in subtle and 
   not-so-subtle ways, such as the scene where the parents forcibly make 
   their children get on the bus, even though they don't want to (Albert 
   says to his parents, &quot;I hope you know this is the last time you 
   will see your child alive!&quot;) or where Ulla shows her true form 
   to Carl when she comes to have dinner with Jesper (who has written a 
   book about love). In this film, it is the kids who act like adults 
   and the adults who act like children, but Bornedal doesn't skimp on 
   the creepy (yet funny) sequences, like where the children watch in 
   horror as Ulla feeds on a live chicken or when she shrinks the school 
   principal (who sneaks into her bedroom in his underwear) and eats 
   him. The always-changing photo is also a good gimmick (shades of <B><A HREF="back_to_the_future_1985.htm">BACK
    TO THE FUTURE</A></B> - 1985) and, besides some obvious CGI, the 
   effects in the film are very well done. Worth a viewing, either in 
   its original language with English subtitles (under its original 
   title, <B><A HREF="vikaren_2006.htm">VIKAREN</A></B>) or the better-than-average
    English dubbed version. Also starring Nikolaj Falkenberg-Klok,

    The film opens with American Ray Cleaver (John Garwood) escaping 
   from the jungles of Manila by stealing a local's truck and driving 
   himself to the hospital, where it is so overcrowded, no doctors or 
   nurses will attend to him even though it's obvious (at least to the 
   viewer) that his face and body are transforming into something quite 
   Neanderthal. He gives up on the hospital and heads to the airport, 
   where he beats up a businessman in a bathroom, steals his clothes, 
   passport and ticket, hops on the plane and not too long afterward the 
   pilot is radioing Guam Airport to make an emergency landing because a 
   psychotic passenger (Guess who?) is manhandling the crew. When the 
   plane lands in Guam, the waiting military surround the plane and 
   shoot and kill Cleaver, who now looks like a caveman in a business 
   suit! In Venezuela, Dr. Alix Pardee (Antoinette Bower; <B><A HREF="die_sister_die_1972.htm">DIE
    SISTER, DIE!</A></B> - 1972) hops a plane to Guam and performs an 
   autopsy on the freakishly changed Cleaver (after performing the 
   autopsy, she turns to her assistant and says, &quot;Wow!&quot;). She 
   heads to Manila to investigate, where she learns that Cleaver was an 
   AWOL Marine who disappeared a month earlier after being arrested and 
   accused of being a hash smuggler and then sent to some rehabilitation 
   camp in the jungle for some &quot;experimental&quot; treatment. Dr. 
   Pardee hops a steamer heading to the city of Pangan, where she is 
   being shadowed by mysterious American businessman Stewart Victor 
   (Harry Lauter). Once in Pangan, Dr. Pardee is met by Dr. Raul Rojas 
   (Manny Oheda), who informs her that Cleaver isn't the only case of 
   radical transformation in the area. A horrible &quot;evil spirit&quot;
    is attacking the residents of a remote jungle village, so both 
   doctors make their way by canoe to investigate. They mistakenly go 
   over a huge waterfall in their canoe (How in the world did they not 
   see it?) and when Dr. Pardee awakens, she is naked and in bed at a 
   plantation run by Dr. Bill Fleming (Craig Littler), who informs her 
   that Dr. Rojas has not been found and is presumed dead. Dr. Pardee is 
   rightfully concerned of her situation, as there are bars on the 
   windows, she hears terrible screams at night and she spots Stewart 
   Victor walking freely around the plantation, usually with a hunting 
   rifle in his hands. It's plain to see that Dr. Fleming is another 
   incarnation of Dr. Morneau, as he has created a serum that supposedly 
   turns all the hardened criminals in his care into docile, law-<A HREF="daughters_of_satan_superbeast_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/daughters of satan-superbeast ad mat9 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="196" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>abiding
    citizens. Yeah, right. It's also apparent that his serum has serious 
   side effects, turning some of Dr. Fleming's subjects into creatures 
   that nightmares are made of (makeup effects by <B><A HREF="planet_of_the_apes_1968.htm">PLANET
    OF THE APES</A></B>' John Chambers). Dr. Pardee must figure out a 
   way to escape the plantation before she is killed by the dastardly 
   Victor, who pays Dr. Fleming big bucks to hunt his failures like 
   prey. How she escapes will have you wishing that she gets a bullet 
   right between her eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a boring and slow-moving 
   horror film that plays more like a travelogue during the first half 
   before becoming a second rate <B><A HREF="island_of_dr_moreau_1996.htm">ISLAND

   surprising that this is George Schenck's only directorial effort, 
   because it's a rather static affair that just meanders along at a 
   snail's pace, never coming close to having a pulse (Schenck switched 
   to being a successful TV producer/writer, a job he still holds to 
   this day). Antoinette Bower makes for a deadly dull heroine and Craig 
   Littler is one of the nicest mad scientists I have ever seen. Only 
   Harry Lauter registers slightly as a big game hunter who enjoys 
   tracking down and killing Dr. Fleming's &quot;mistakes&quot;. There's 
   not much in the way of nudity or violence (at least in the print that 
   I viewed, which was sourced from a TV print, the only way to see this 
   film in the States for over 35 years, but there are reports that the 
   autopsy Dr. Pardee performs in the beginning of the film contained 
   real, gruesome autopsy footage in the unedited version), so all the 
   viewer has to look forward to is John Chambers' Neanderthal makeups 
   and lots of shots of people walking around, talking incessantly or 
   running through the jungle. Not worth your time. Also known as <B>PRIMAL

   who gets his just desserts. Also starring Jose Romulo, Bruno

   the end of the Civil War, a unit of Nothern soldiers from the 44th 
   Division force a small group of Confederate soldiers to walk across a 
   minefield (a tried-and-true method of making sure the coast is 
   clear!) and only young boy Jeremy (Chad Sheets) makes it to the other 
   side alive. Jeremy, who has &quot;special powers&quot;, causes 
   something catastrophic to happen (we don't see it) when a strange 
   light emits from his clenched fist and a heavy wind blows in from 
   nowhere. In the present day, some greenhorn members of the Army's 
   44th Division are on a training mission in the same location where 
   the massacre of the Confederate soldiers took place 120 years

    out on the exact spot of the massacre (it's a barren area where 
   nothing seems to grow) and Pvt. Tim Cort (Bobby Di Cicco) falls into 
   a hole, which turns out to be a hidden Civil War bunker. Pvt. Chris 
   Mendez (Scott Jacoby), the unit's unofficial Civil War expert, 
   notices a strange phenomenon on the barren spot. There seems to be a 
   mysterious wind that eminates from the center of the barren spot and 
   blows outward in all directions (this plot point is dropped as soon 
   as it is mentioned). While Ray is digging a latrine (he's on Sgt. 
   Hawkins' shitlist for some past transgressions), he unearths a skull 
   which Tim stupidly uses for target practice. That night, a drunk Tim 
   tries to rape Pvt. Angela Lejune (Talia Balsam), the unit's only 
   other female member, but she sticks a knife between his legs and he 
   walks away, only to fall into an underground man-made tunnel, where 
   he is attacked by some rotting zombie Confederate soldiers and 
   killed. The rest of the film finds the soldiers being attacked and 
   killed one-by-one by the living dead Confederate soldiers, while Ray 
   discovers that he has a personal connection to the massacre that 
   happened over a century earlier. And is it possible that the old mute

   cult following when making it to home video. After playing a 
   practical joke on a necking couple outside a creepy old abandoned 
   house, Artie (Bennett Liss) and Charlie (Johnny Doran) are then 
   brutally murdered by an invisible force inside the house<A HREF="superstition_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/superstition vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="136" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   (Charlie finds Artie's head cooking in a microwave and Charlie is 
   graphically cut in half when trying to escape out a window). When the 
   bodies are discovered, the county gives the church (who own the house 
   and surrounding property) 120 days to clean up the house and make it 
   livable again, otherwise the house will be destroyed. The church 
   sends Reverend David Thompson (David Houghton) to survey the property 
   and get it in shape for Reverend George Leahy (Larry Pennell) and his 
   family to live in. The house, known as the &quot;Sharack Place&quot;, 
   named for the original owner who was said to be a witch, has a long 
   history of unexplained deaths, the latest being a cop who is dragged 
   into the pond behind the house by a pair of taloned hands. 
   Church-hating Inspector Sturgess (Albert Salmi) blames the death of 
   his officer on Arlen (Joshua Cadman), the mute son of the last 
   surviving Sharack female, Elvira (Jacquelyn Hyde), who looks like a 
   witch and lives in a small house on the property. Sturgess blames all 
   the recent murders on Arlen (he has a real hard-on for him) and 
   Reverend Thompson orders the pond to be drained to see if there are 
   any bodies in it. It seems that the pond doesn't want to be drained, 
   though (the pumps keep getting clogged), but a large wooden crucifix 
   is found at the bottom of the pond and once it is removed, strange 
   things begin to happen, none of them good. Reverend Thompson meets 
   Mary (Kim Marie), a little girl in a white dress, who turns out to be 
   an evil spirit. Every time she makes an appearance, someone dies a 
   gruesome death. The first one is Reverend Maier (Stacy Keach Sr.), 
   who dies in a freak &quot;accident&quot; when the spinning blade of a 
   circular saw disengages itself, flies through the air and slices 
   through his chest (and the chair he is sitting on). A electrician is 
   hanged when his neck gets caught around the cable of the house's 
   elevator. When the gin-soaked Reverend Leahy moves in with his 
   family, one of his daughters is nearly scared to death when a 
   disembodied hand latches on to her leg while she is swimming in the 
   pond. Somehow, the stubborn and sarcastic Inspector Sturgess still 
   believes that Arlen is responsible for all these new deaths, but 
   Arlen seems to have disappeared. The Leahy's young son, Justin (Bobby 
   Jacoby; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Bloody Birthday">BLOODY BIRTHDAY</A></B>

   make a discovery of a secret room), while Reverend Thompson 
   researches the history of the crucifix and the house. Once Thompson 
   discovers the truth (told in flashback), he races back to the house 
   to save the Leahy family. He should have driven a little faster.&nbsp;

    bloody horror films will find a lot to admire here. Director James 
   W. Roberson (<B><A HREF="legend_of_alfred_packer_1978.htm">THE LEGEND 
   OF ALFRED PACKER</A></B> - 1978; <B><A HREF="giant_of_thunder_mountain_1991.htm">THE
    GIANT OF THUNDER MOUNTAIN</A></B> - 1991) not only tosses in 
   numerous gory deaths, he also builds-up a resonable amount of tension 
   and dread, thanks to some excellent camerawork and editing. The 
   bloody set-pieces go way beyond R-rated gore (it was released to 
   theaters unrated) and after the first couple of minutes watching 
   this, you will see why. A head explodes in a microwave, a body is cut 
   in two, a saw blade rips through a body (the film's highlight gore 
   scene), death by wine press and a wooden spike through a head are 
   just some of the juicy goods on view. The film has two faults and 
   this is what they are: 1) Albert Salmi's (<B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#EmpireOfTheAnts77">EMPIRE
    OF THE ANTS</A></B> - 1977) Inspector Sturgess is such a prejudicial 
   hothead (his hatred of the church, priests and mutes is never 
   explained), it's hard to believe any town would hire him as their top 
   cop. 2) It's strange that Reverend Leahy was made an alcoholic when 
   it's never properly fleshed-out. He acts more like a coward than an 
   alcoholic. It seems the only reason he was made a drunk was to give 
   one of his daughters a reason to yell at him every time he opens his 
   mouth. Don't let those two things deter you, though, because <B><A HREF="superstition_1982b.htm">SUPERSTITION</A></B> 
   (also known as <B><A HREF="witch_1982.htm">THE WITCH</A></B>) is a 
   fun, blood-drenched flick that delivers what it promises. Besides, 
   you gotta love a film where absolutely no one is left alive once the 
   final credits roll, not even the kids. This is one of the first films 
   to be Executive Produced by the team of Mario Kassar and Andrew

   where the authorities can find it, causing the police to open an 
   investigation which includes questioning people at the hospital where 
   Dr. Frosta works. When Frosta's fiancee Simone (Marcelle Bichetti) 
   leaves him to hook back up with American ex-boyfriend Ben (William 
   Harrison), Frosta kidnaps her, binds her to his lab table, strips her 
   and kisses her body (shades of <B>RE-ANIMATOR</B> again, though this 
   one was made 11 years earlier, hmmmmm....), before killing her and 
   using his serum on her lifeless body (but not before some quick

   highly atmospheric. The best scene shows Frosta standing on the bank

   (2010) -</B> This Texas-lensed regional horror flick is truly one of 
   the goriest films I have seen in many years, but if you are looking 
   for sympathetic characters you can identify with or root for, look 
   somewhere else. The premise is simple: A group of chain-smoking, 
   beer-drinking, drug-taking, lollypop-sucking, body-pierced punkers 
   break into an abandoned warehouse and set up for a rave they plan to 
   throw later that night. Unfortunately, the warehouse is not as empty 
   as they expected. It is infested with four ghoul-like females and a 
   hulking welding mask-wearing killer known as &quot;The Beast&quot; 
   (Jeremy Sumrall), who wields a heavy hammer made out of an anvil 
   attached to a pipe, a pair of sharp garden shears, razor wire and 
   other weapons of death. The group, headed by Charlie (Ashley Kay), 
   begin setting up the lighting, DJ booth and sound system (not to 
   mention a &quot;Makeout Room&quot;, where Charlie pimps out two girls 
   as whores for anyone who is willing to pay the price), while The 
   Beast begins dispatching the group one-by-o<A HREF="sweatshop_2010.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/sweatshop 2010 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="194" HEIGHT="267" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ne
    in various extreme bloody ways (nothing is left to the imagination). 
   Lighting girl Kim (Danielle Jones) is tied to a table with the razor 
   wire and has the lower half of her body crushed with the anvil 
   hammer, stripping the skin off both of her legs (she survives, but 
   has her head crushed with the hammer as she tries to crawl away later 
   in the film). Kenny (Vincent Guerrero) is decapitated at his jawline 
   while Charlie is giving him a blowjob in her car and when Charlie 
   escapes, she accidentally puts her hand in Kenny's bloody stump and 
   then falls out of the car, landing on the top half of Kenny's head 
   (people who get queasy easy should turn away). Jade (Melanie Donihoo) 
   tries to escape from the ghoul girls in a warehouse elevator, only to 
   have her head crushed through the elevator's door grate by The 
   Beast's hammer. Scottyboy (Peyton Wetzel, easily the most interesting 
   character in the film for reasons I'll explain later) is impaled 
   through the neck by the garden shears, only to have The Beast grab 
   the handles and suddenly open them, instantly cutting off Scottyboy's 
   head. There is plenty more extreme gore on view, so if you're a fan 
   of 80's-styled slasher films, I'll leave them for you to discover, 
   including an unexpected bloody massacre of the patrons that show up 
   for the rave.&nbsp;

   except for spiked-mohawked Scottyboy and his older brother, the 
   straight-laced, but mean, Wade (Brent D. Himes, who looks like a 
   slightly less obese John Goodman wearing a trucker's cap). Scottyboy 
   loves to receive oral sex, but can't stand to be 
   &quot;snowballed&quot; (Google it) or perform oral sex on a female, 
   so when fellow punker Miko (Julin) makes a bet with him to perform 
   oral sex on her and he loses the bet, she tries to force him to 
   perform oral sex, only to have The Beast crush Miko's body with his 
   hammer while she is standing (one of the film's most upchucking 
   moments). Wade is nothing but a big redneck bully who gets drunk on 
   beer and tries to have sex with Kim while she is tied to the table, 
   failing to notice that Kim's legs are nothing but bloody bones. He 
   fails to deliver the goods because he is too drunk, but The Beast 
   thrusts two spikes under Wade's chin and razor wires him to a table 
   with his brother and Charlie (his fate is still left in the air when 
   the film ends, the only cast member we don't find out who lives or 
   dies). Hey, if you like wall-to-wall gore that is very well done and 
   filmed professionally, this film is for you. If you want a plot to go 
   with it (we really have no idea how The Beast or the ghoul girls 
   claimed this warehouse as their own, as none of them are given a 
   backstory), look somewhere else. Let's just say that the film doesn't 
   have any lofty goals and delivers the goods to the audience it was

   Morgan (Aleisa Shirley) is rapidly approaching her sixteenth 
   birthday, a series of murders begin to occur in a small Texas town in 
   this horror film that also has something to say about the plight of 
   Native Americans in modern society. Melissa (who is sexually active) 
   is new in town and is watched closely by her overprotective father 
   (and American Indian artifacts expert) Dr. John Morgan (Patrick

   mother, Joanne (Susan Strasberg). There seems to be a serious problem 
   with the people who become friendly with Melissa: Most of them end up 
   being killed, stabbed viciously with an Indian hunting knife. The 
   first to end up dead is Johnny (Glenn Withrow), a boy who fooled 
   around and smoked pot with Melissa and was caught by her father. He 
   ends up getting sliced and diced in the desert in the middle of the 
   night. When <A HREF="sweet_sixteen_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/sweet sixteen poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Sheriff
    Burke (Bo Hopkins, who else?), his son Hank (Steve Antin) and 
   daughter Marci (Dana Kimmell) find Johnny's mutilated body, they 
   interview Melissa, her father and mother and Melissa drops hints that 
   local Indian Jason (Don Shanks) may be responsible (he spurned her 
   advances the night before because she was underage). Now we know 
   that, besides being sexually active, Melissa is also very spiteful 
   (and prone to lying). Johnny brother, local redneck Billy (Don 
   Stroud, who is woefully underused here), gets wind of Jason's alleged 
   involvement and turns his brother's death into a race war against the 
   Indians, with other townspeople joining the fray (one local calls 
   Jason a &quot;red nigger&quot;). As more people end up dead, the 
   sheriff is caught between vigilante justice by his neighbors and 
   trying to find the real killer, while Hank and Marci perform their 
   own investigation and come too close to the truth. Who is slicing up 
   all these people up with a buck knife? You will find out at Melissa's 
   sixteenth birthday party and the whole town is invited!&nbsp; Quite

   - 1975; not the hardcore porn film with the same name) builds a lot 
   of suspense with the town's prejudice and Melissa's spiteful ways. 
   Scripter Erwin Goldman gets a lot of mileage out of basic 
   slice-and-dice techniques by actually telling a decent story to go 
   along with the slasher elements. The contrast between Sheriff Burke's 
   loving relationship with his kids versus Melissa's cold and detached 
   relationship with her parents is never more apparent then when Marci 
   accuses Melissa of lying to her father when she blamed Greyfeather 
   (Henry Wilcoxon), Jason's grandfather, of murdering the school 
   quarterback, leading to Billy and some of the townspeople to lynch 
   him. Melissa's response to Marci is. &quot;Why do you have to be so 
   good?&quot; While the murders are not very graphic (there's evidence 
   of some post-production tampering to achieve an R rating), they are 
   well-handled and shocking. The cast of genre vets do a nice job here, 
   even if it's weird to hear Patrick Macnee's British accent amongst 
   everything Texan. Even though the real killer is not very hard to 
   spot (there's plenty of clues for the killer's motivation throughout 
   the film, but when Dr. Morgan frames Jason, it practically gives it 
   away), but the story is different enough and the cast good enough 
   (including Michael Pataki [<B><A HREF="halloween_4_1988.htm">HALLOWEEN
    4: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS</A></B> - 1988] as the town's mayor 
   and Sharon Farrell [<B><A HREF="lone_wolf_mcquade_1983.htm">LONE WOLF MCQUADE</A></B> 
   - 1983] as Hopkin's love interest who helps him break the case) to 
   keep you involved throughout. There's also a full frontal nude scene 
   of Melissa taking a shower (I guess Aleisa Shirley wasn't actually 
   fifteen years old) for those who keep track of stuff like that 
   (fuckin' A!). The end credits song, &quot;Melissa's Theme&quot; , is

    FALLS</A><A NAME="TalonFalls2017"></A> (2017) -</B> Every avid 
   reader of this site knows that I absolutely love horror films that 
   take place in carnivals or amusement parks, but this film will test 
   the patience of a saint. I'll get to why it is bad later in the 
   review. The film is one huge flashback, as we meet Lindsey (Morgan 
   Wiggins), who comes running in front of a pickup truck all bloodied 
   and battered. She then appears in a hospital room with gauze covering 
   her eyes and tells her story to Dr. Onychectomy (Matthew Bozone; do 
   not look up the definition of &quot;Onychectomy&quot; until the film 
   is done!). It seems she and three other friends, Sean (Ryan Rudolph), 
   Ryder (Jordyn Rudolph) and Lance (Brad Bell), are on Fall Break from 
   college and decide to go on a road trip to visit the <A HREF="talon_falls_screampark.htm">Talon
    Falls Screampark</A> in Commonwealth, Kentucky (an actual Haunted 
   House attraction). When they arrive there, they find the screampark 
   is crowded, but it is highly obvious that the park workers don't want 
   them to leave. When they see the huge line of people waiting to get 
   into the Haunted House attraction, they almost leave, but a park 
   worker walks up to them and says he can get them into the Haunted 
   House immediately as long as they wear the red plastic wristbands he 
   hands them (It is also obvious that these wristbands are a way to 
   mark them as potential victims. But of what?). The foursome walk into 
   the Haunted House, where the corridors are full of attractions, such 
   as a man strapped to an electric chair. The switch to flip on the 
   electricity is controlled by the visitors and Lance seems to enjoy 
   electrocuting the man. Maybe a little too much (It is also highly 
   obvious that he is actually electrucuting a live human being.). Lance's<A HREF="talon_falls_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/talon falls 2017 poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="256" HEIGHT="391" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   actions don't go unnoticed by whomever is watching him on the many 
   cameras that are strewn throughout the Haunted House, so he is led to 
   the Control Room, where he watches Lyndsey and Sean get hit in the 
   face with a sledge hammer and girlfriend Ryder grabbed from behind 
   and dragged away. We are then introduced to Tiny (Tim McCain) a hulk 
   of a man who is wearing a very ugly rubber mask, making him look like 
   a giant pig.&nbsp; Sean, Ryder and Lyndsey are now in cages, as we 
   watch Tiny pulling another female victim out of a cage and hand her 
   over to another masked person, who tortures her until she screams 
   (This film has a LOT of screams on the soundtrack!). Tiny then goes 
   back to retrieve Sean, When he puts up a fight, Tiny shocks him with 
   a cattle prod and drags him away to a torture room full of bloody 
   surgical tools and straps him to a chair. The masked torturer enters 
   the room, sharpens his knives&nbsp; and procedes to cut off Sean's 
   left ear and rips-off one of his toenails (all shown lovingly in 
   close-up). An unnamed male prisoner (Kurtis Hage) comes up with a 
   plan to escape, but he needs Lindsey and Ryder's help to pull it off. 
   He breaks out of his cage, gets into a fight with Tiny, while Ryder 
   holds a murderous guard dog by a rope leash (It actually looks like 
   the poor dog is suffering. I wonder if the ASPCA was there to monitor 
   the action?), The man grabs hold of Tiny's keys and slides them to 
   Lyndsey so she can open the padlocks to her and Ryder's cages. 
   Lyndsey opens her and Ryder's cages , hits Tiny over the head with a 
   two-by-four, knocking him out and they escape (leaving behind all the 
   other female victims trapped in cages, the bitches!). The man is 
   killed by the guard dog. Lyndsey and Ryder hide out in the Control 
   Room, where they watch Sean being tortured on one of the monitors. 
   This brings up the big question: What happened to Lance?&nbsp; The 
   masked torturer puts a vice on Sean's head and tightens it, while 
   Sean screams in pain. The girls try to escape the Haunted House with 
   Tiny hot on their trail. They become trapped in a slaughterhouse, 
   while an axe-wielding Tiny looks for them. He is given instructions 
   on where to find them by the man in the Control Room (Michial 
   Courtney). Just when it seems that Ryder is about to become chopped 
   liver, Lyndsey appears and stabs Tiny in the side with a large knife 
   (it has little effect). The girls try to hide from Tiny and the many 
   cameras located throughout the park. This is when we find out what 
   has happened to Lance, He is now in the electric chair while paying 
   customers jolt him and laugh, not knowing they are actually 
   eltrocuting him. When Ryder tries to free Lance, Tiny pulls the 
   switch, electrocuting the both of them (We see Ryder falling to the 
   groud, her face all burned and smoke coming out of her mouth!). Tiny 
   chases Lyndsey and she falls through a round metal conduit, leading 
   her to the dumping ground of the Haunted House's previous victims. 
   Thinking that Lyndsey is hiding under the dead bodies, Tiny hacks 
   away at them with his axe. Lyndsey escapes the park and it brings us 
   back to the beginning of the film where she runs in front of the 
   pickup truck. In a surprise ending everyone saw coming, the old man 
   in the truck is actually a park worker and Dr. Onychectomy is 
   actually the masked torturer (Onychectomy is a medical term for the 
   surgical removal of fingernails or toenails.). We then see Lyndsey 
   being tortured in the Haunted House, while clueless paying customers 
   think it is just another sideshow attraction. 
   Director/screenwriter/co-producer/editor Josh Shreve (<B><A HREF="chasing_ghosts_2014.htm">CHASING
    GHOSTS</A></B> - 2014) gives us no motivations on why Haunted House 
   workers are torturing and killing paying customers, except for the 
   pure joy of it. This film is abysmally acted by a cast of amateurs 
   (this is the first acting job for the four college kids and it shows. 
   The rest of the cast are players from the actual Haunted House.). It 
   is plain to see that Josh Shreve got his inspiration from <B><A HREF="texas_chainsaw_massacre_1974.htm">THE

    FUNHOUSE</B></A> (1981), but this film cannot hold a candle to those 
   classics. In those films, there was a reason for the killing: For 
   meat for the Sawyer's clan award-winning Texas Chili and to cover up 
   the fact that the kids saw the deformed hulk in a Frankenstein-mask 
   kill a prostitute. You will get none of that satisfaction here. While 
   the practical makeup effects are better than average, it comes across 
   as torture for torture's sake. There are also many gaping plotholes 
   in the screenplay, such as when Lindsey refuses to get out of the car 
   when they reach Talon Falls (she was against going there), but the 
   next scene shows her standing next to Sean in the park. If you can 
   overlook the terrible acting, lack of connective tissue between 
   scenes and no reason for the killers to kill, you may enjoy this 
   74-minute exercize in torture. Me? I was expecting much more and 
   didn't get any satisfaction. For a more enjoyable experience , try

   overweight bayou brothers, who are poachers and thieves, that killed

   larger pelts. The creature that&nbsp; was manufactured escapes,

    I have a feeling the title change was appropriate. The creature is 
   shown mainly in shadows or long shots, so you really don't get a good 
   look at it. Maybe that is for the best. The real stand-out is Michael 
   Tedesco, who plays T-Bob, the half-wit brother of the bayou duo. With

   Quaint, TV-like horror film made back-to-back with the more raucous <B><A HREF="arnold_1973.htm">ARNOLD</A></B> 
   by the same director and screenwriter. The elderly Claude Dupree 
   (John Carradine) is the creator and proprietor of Dupree's Wax Museum 
   And Chamber Of Horrors in late Nineteenth Century London, who treats 
   all of his wax figures (many of them mass murderers from throughout 
   history) like fine art. If he finds the tiniest imperfection, Dupree 
   and his hideously deformed deaf mute assistant, Karkov (Steven 
   Marlo), cart the wax figure down to the basement, melt it in a huge 
   vat of wax and recreate a perfect copy. Alas, Mr. Dupree is getting 
   on in years and is being pressured by businessman Amos Burns 
   (Broderick Crawford), who wants to buy Dupree's wax figures and move 
   them to New York City. Mr. Dupree is reticent about selling (When he 
   asks what is to become of Karkov, Mr. Burns replies, &quot;There are 
   institutions for freaks like that.&quot;), so he asks Mr. Burns to 
   return in the morning for his final decision. Mr. Burns leaves the 
   museum and walks the fog-shrouded streets of London to Tim Fowley's 
   (Louis Hayward) pub, where he listens to music hall singer Laurie 
   Mell (Shani Wallis) perform and eventually takes her home, which 
   upsets Karkov, who watches all the action through the sub-sidewalk 
   grating. That night, Mr. Dupree has a terrible nightmare where <A HREF="terror_in_the_wax_museum_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/terror in the wax museum poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="206" HEIGHT="299" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>all
    the wax figures (including Jack The Ripper and Lizzie Borden) come 
   to life and attack him for betraying them. When he wakes up, he 
   decides not to sell the museum, but when he goes downstairs to check 
   on his wax figures and &quot;explain&quot; to them his decision (he 
   is their creator after all), the wax figure of Jack The Ripper 
   seemingly comes to life for real, calls Dupree a &quot;liar&quot; and 
   stabs him in the heart, killing him instantly. Police Inspector 
   Daniels (Maurice Evans) and Sgt. Michael Hawks (Mark W. Edwards) of 
   Scotland Yard are called-in to investigate Dupree's murder and 
   interrogate suspects Mr. Burns, Dupree associate Harry Flexner (Ray 
   Milland), Dupree lawyer Mr. Southgott (Patric Knowles) and Karkov. 
   The arrival of Dupree's niece, Meg Collins (Nicole Shelby), and her 
   guardian, Julia Hawthorn (Elsi Lanchester), raises the questions: Who 
   actually owns the museum and where is Dupree's will? The only bit of 
   information that is known is that Dupree's last will and testament is 
   located somewhere in the museum, so the search is on. Mr. Burns 
   suggests that the killer may be the real Jack The Ripper (The real 
   Ripper is still at large and may not be too happy about the way 
   Dupree portrayed him in wax) and since Sgt. Hawks worked on the 
   Ripper murders, he doesn't discount it. The greedy Miss Hawthorn 
   takes over the museum until the will is found and immediately reopens 
   the museum to take advantage of the throngs of gawkers lingering 
   outside. The museum plays to packed houses with Mr. Flexner as the 
   tour guide. When an attempt is made on Meg's life (the killer is 
   still dressed as the Ripper) and Mr. Burns is found dead in the 
   museum (he was run-through with a sword), Sgt. Hawks must gather the 
   clues (including a white carnation) and catch the killer before Meg 
   (whom he has grown quite fond of) ends up dead or worse: dipped in 
   the wax vat in the basement.&nbsp; This bloodless horror film, 
   directed by Georg Fenady (a respected TV director with hundreds of TV 
   episodes, including 29 episodes of <B><A HREF="quincy_tv_series.htm">QUINCY
    M.E.</A></B> [1980 - 1983], under his belt before his death in 2008) 
   and written by Jameson Brewer (<B><A HREF="island_of_lost_girls_1969.htm">ISLAND
    OF LOST GIRLS</A></B> - 1969), both responsible for the 
   aforementioned black comedy <B>ARNOLD</B> (1973), is a treasure trove 
   of classic movie stars, but as both a horror film and a murder 
   mystery, it fails drastically because it is far too tame for it's own 
   good. This could (and actually did) play on TV with no cuts, as the 
   film takes a 30's &amp; 40's approach to showing the murders (as a 
   matter of fact, 1933's <B><A HREF="mystery_of_the_wax_museum_1933.htm">THE
    MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM</A></B> is far more graphic than this), 
   relying on mood rather than blood, which must have disappointed 
   moviegoers in the 70's (the ads played-up Karkov [which the ads 
   misspelled as &quot;Karkoff&quot;!] as the monster, when he was 
   really one of the most sympathetic characters in the film). It is 
   also obvious that many of the wax figures are portrayed by living 
   extras that try to remain as still as possible, but fail in many of 
   the scenes (it helps if you pay close attention to the background of 
   the scenes shot in the Chamber of Horrors). Consider <B><A HREF="terror_in_the_wax_museum_1973b.htm">TERROR

   mix rock-and-roll with a Grand Guignol-esque stage show where both

   hacked-off, all for the sake of giving the audience what they want: a 
   bloody good show. There's as much going on backstage as there is 
   during the stage show. Roadie Herb (Jeff Morgan) puts on the Clowns' 
   makeup because he feels he is too ugly to get chicks without it. Jeff 
   (David Thompson), another roadie, is a lazy good-for-nothing who 
   likes to stiff drug dealers and take advantage of Herb every chance 
   he gets. When a female drug dealer (the one that Jeff stiffed) is 
   viciously stabbed at the back door of the theater the Clowns are 
   playing at (she's waiting in vain for $50 Jeff owes her) by someone

    (Chip Greenman), Henry (Rick Pemberton) and Cherry (Dave Galluzzo), 
   happy since the band is finally finding success after changing their 
   sound and stage persona (something Fred is not too happy about), but 
   is it possible they have also gained a murderous groupie, or is the 
   killer one of their own? Tim throws a party for the band at the 
   theater during their day off, which is full of beautiful topless 
   women, booze and drugs, but the killer is also there in full Clowns 
   regalia, stabbing a naked female groupie to death and then slashing 
   the throat of another groupie that the band members were passing 
   around like a joint in the secret &quot;Blood Room&quot; (it's 
   literally a blood room now). The killer then murders another topless 
   groupie sitting alone in the mezzanine section by stabbing her 
   between her breasts (Groupie: &quot;Is there something I can do for 
   you?&quot; Killer: &quot;Yes...die!&quot;) while the wild party 
   continues. When the janitor finds the body of one of the dead girls 
   in a bathroom stall, the party stops and Lt. Lambert brings in snitch 
   Jane (Lisa Rodriguez) to keep a close eye on the band to make sure 
   one of them is not the killer. Herb finds a letter in Tim's briefcase 
   which shows that Tim's mother is a religious zealot and Tim may be a 
   Momma's boy (this can't be good!), while Tim fires Jeff for not doing 
   his job, with Jeff vowing, &quot;I'll get you!&quot; The finale finds 
   The Clowns putting on a final bloody stage show, where the killer 
   begins to murder people, including Lt. Lambert and Jane backstage and 
   Herb on-stage, but the audience thinks it's all part of the 
   show.&nbsp; <B><A HREF="terror_on_tour_1980b.htm">TERROR ON TOUR</A></B> 
   is strictly minor league horror material that takes forever to get 
   moving. Director Don Edmonds (<B><A HREF="ilsa_she_wolf_of_the_ss_1974.htm">ILSA,
    SHE WOLF OF THE SS</A></B> - 1975; <B><A HREF="bare_knuckles_1977.htm">BARE
    KNUCKLES</A></B> - 1977) and screenwriter Dell Lekus seem more 
   interested in showing the band's backstage lifestyle of broads, booze 
   and drugs than the actual horror elements and besides the first few 
   opening minutes and the finale, we never see The Clowns performing on 
   stage (the music is actually performed by a band called The Names). 
   The murders are strictly of the pre-<B><A HREF="friday_the_13th_1980.htm">FRIDAY
    THE 13TH</A></B> variety, where blood is merely splashed on the 
   victims. No gaping, blood-spurting wounds here. There are enough red 
   herrings to keep most retarded viewers guessing the killer's 
   identity, but most horror fans will know who the killer is within the 
   first fifteen minutes (blame religion if you can't come up with a 
   better idea). The underlit photography is a major distraction since 
   most of the film takes place backstage in the dimly lit rooms and 
   hallways, so you'll be spending most of your time squinting to make 
   out what the hell is going on. Not worth the eyestrain and the 
   non-ending will make you madder than hell. The only time this film 
   shows that it has a pulse is when Fred plays a love ballad called 
   &quot;Lisa&quot; (in the vein of KISS' &quot;Beth&quot;) backstage 
   and tells Lt. Lambert that he wishes the band could go back to 
   playing that type of music. Lt. Lambert simply says, &quot;I like 
   it&quot; and Fred actually looks appreciative of the comment. If the 
   film stuck to the little human aspects like this, maybe the film 
   would have resonated more. Alex Rebar (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Incredible Melting">THE

   put on hold when David and Sue find a living female named Karen 
   (Yvonne Saa) and bring her back to the underground lab. Linda 
   examines Karen and finds that she is pregnant, but Hal orders Linda 
   not to tell anyone else just in case the baby is a mutant and they 
   have to kill it. Sue and David quickly find out, though (Sue wants to 
   have a baby with David and views this news as a sign of hope), but 
   there are more pressing problems at the moment. The gargoyles also 
   want Karen and have found the secret entrance to the lab and are 
   trying to break in. Linda also discovers that Karen's pregnancy is 
   advancing at an accelerated rate (That can't be good), so Hal orders 
   Linda to abort the fetus. The fetus has other ideas and bursts out of 
   Karen's stomach during the operation (killing her) and escapes into 
   the air vents. Linda determines that the fetus will become a 
   full-grown gargoyle within twenty-four hours, so everyone bands 
   together to flush it out and kill it. Unfortunately, the now 
   fully-grown gargoyle proves to be a trouper and kills nearly everyone 
   and rapes Sue. Linda and David rescue her (everyone else is dead) and 
   when Linda examines her, she finds Sue is pregnant. The question then 
   becomes: Whose baby is it, David's or the gargoyle's? We don't have 
   to ponder that question for too long, because it turns out her fetus 
   is a monster, so Sue gives herself a homemade abortion, killing the 
   baby and herself. A dog whistle (!) and the spinning blades of an

   as the survivors hunt the rogue gargoyle through the various levels 
   of the lab while the gargoyle kills them one-by-one, stopping long

    OF THE RED DEATH</A></B> - 1989) from a mutant and promises her 
   dying brother, Aaron (Gordon Currie), that he will look after her. Of 
   course, they fall in love and end up bumping nasties around a 
   campfire (after he shaves off his beard), after which, Ariel informs 
   David that she knows he got her pregnant (Um, what?). David better 
   get to the lab quick because, besides the intrigue between various 
   members of Von Demming's group (Sharon has developed a vaccine in 
   secret, but doesn't have enough to go around; others are beginning to 
   succumb from the plague), a severed finger of a mutant is accidently 
   brought into the lab and is transforming into a gelatinous blob that 
   attaches itself to Jamie (Larry Gelman) and becomes a new kind of 
   creature called a &quot;Lusus&quot;. Ariel is kidnapped by a band of 
   human scavengers led by Elaba (Cyndi Gossett), who offers Ariel to a 
   mutant in some strange ritual. After the mutant rapes her, David 
   arrives and saves her and they head to the lab (Poor Butch has his 
   throat cut by a member of the scavengers and dies in David's arms). 
   To make a long story short, once they get to the lab, Ariel delivers 
   a baby that's half human/half mutant, which grows to adult size in a 
   matter of minutes. The mutant, along with the Lusus, begins killing 
   members of the lab until only David, Ariel, Kyle and Robin (Renee 
   Jones) are left alive to battle the two monsters.&nbsp; While 
   basically nothing but a retread of the first film, <B><A HREF="terror_within_2_1990b.htm">THE

   previous film. Star Andrew Stevens, who took over directing and 
   scripting chores here (his first time in both fields), knows damn 
   well what genre audiences want and he delivers as much boobs and 
   blood as his meager budget would allow. Besides nude scenes from 
   Clare Hoak and Barbara Alyn Woods, there's a decapitation, various 
   stabbings, a crossbow bolt in the eye, the gooey birth of a mutant 
   baby and numerous slashings by the creatures. Andrew Stevens even 
   gets to boss around his actress mom, Stella Stevens (<B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Little Devils">LITTLE

   in the lab and love interest for R. Lee Ermey. The creature effects 
   are also more polished than the first film, not that they're anything 
   more than men in rubber suits, mind you. If you don't mind the same 
   old rehashed plot, <B>THE TERROR WITHIN II</B> just may satisfy your 
   lust for sex and violence. I enjoyed it much more than the first one.

   Even in the 90's, Roger Corman (who was Executive Producer here) was 
   still employing and willing to take chances on people who would later 
   make names for themselves. Why Corman hasn't received an honorary 
   Oscar for his contributions to motion pictures is a crime I hope will 
   be rectified before he passes away (He finally received an honorary

   releases starred no-name or B-level actors? Well, in the past few 
   years, that has all changed. Such once-bankable stars as Jean-Claude 
   Van Damme, Steven Seagal, Dolph Lundgren, Cuba Gooding Jr., Christian 
   Slater and others all make their main living in DTV flicks (And 
   according to Lundgren in an Entertainment Weekly interview, it is 
   quite lucrative.). Don't get me wrong, some of these films are highly 
   entertaining (even Seagal, who started this trend, seems to now 
   realize that a little quality and looping his own lines make his fans 
   happy), but I just get the feeling that we are at the closing end of 
   the &quot;Big Hollywood Star&quot; cycle and will never see those 
   days again (no matter how many times TV shows like Entertainment 
   Tonight, TMZ and other gossipy dick-munchers try to make stars out of pasty-faced
    CW-ready actors like Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner, both of

    X-FILES</A></B> (1993 - 2002). While the world is suffering a 
   serious pandemic (in which the opening montage of faux YouTube clips 
   link to Global Warming), ecologist Dr. David Kruipen (Kilmer) and his 
   staff are studying the plight of the polar bear in the Canadian 
   Arctic, when they make a stunning discovery: a perfectly preserved 
   wooly mammoth in the ice. The only problem is, the wooly mammoth is 
   infected with some unknown parasite, which begins infecting the 
   humans and other animals, eating them from the inside out. Evelyn 
   (Martha MacIsaac), the daughter of Dr. Kruipen, hates her father ever 
   since he was a no-show at her mother's funeral (he simply couldn't 
   get a flight out due to bad weather), so when she and three undergrad 
   students, Atom (Aaron Ashmore), Ling (Steph Song) and Federico (Kyle 
   Schmid; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DeathRow2006">DEATH ROW</A></B> 
   - 2006) show up at the Arctic compound and find it deserted, they all 
   think it was trashed by eco-terrorists (there is a rotting corpse of 
   a polar bear inside a sealed laboratory), but Evelyn contacts her 
   father by radio to discover he is at another base camp (the one with 
   the mammoth). What Dad doesn't tell Evelyn is that he, Dr. Jane 
   Sanders (Anne Marie DeLuise) and Edward (John Callander) are all 
   infected with the parasite. Jane goes crazy and shoots Dr. Kruipen 
   and Edward and then returns to the compound to sabotage the 
   helicopter, so Evelyn and the three others have no way to escape. 
   What Jane doesn't know is that Ling and helicopter pilot Bart (Vin 
   Leacock) are already infected, since they both have touched the 
   infected polar bear. Evelyn and Atom take an ATV to look for her 
   father after Jane dies a horrible death. They discover the wooly 
   mammoth and Edward's body, but Dad is nowhere to be found (Evelyn 
   thinks a freshly-dug grave is her father's, but we know better). An 
   infected Federico radios for a backup helicopter and destroys the 
   radio when Evelyn tries to cancel the pickup because she doesn't want 
   to spread the parasite to the rest of the world. The rest of the film 
   details Evelyn and Atom's plight (they are the only two not infected) 
   as they try to stop the spread of the parasites (including amputating 
   Bart's infected arm with a meat cleaver), while those infected go 
   crazy and die. Perhaps Dr. Kruipen's journal and video diary will 
   give them a clue? Yet, when Dad returns to the base camp and tries to 
   escape in the rescue helicopter, Evelyn and Atom have no choice but 
   to shoot the helicopter down, killing Dad and saving the world from 
   another pandemic. Or did they? A closing stinger shows that the 
   parasites have made the trek to civilization in the bodies of 
   migrating birds, as a hunting dog chews away at one of the dead 
   bird's bodies.&nbsp; This run-of-the-mill DTV horror flick, directed 
   by Mark A. Lewis (<B><A HREF="ill_fated_2004.htm">ILL FATED</A></B> - 
   2004) and written by Lewis and his brother Michael W. Lewis, fails to 
   generate much suspense and besides a few gory scenes (including the 
   arm amputation and some bloody and gooey open body sores), offers 
   very little to horror fans. Val Kilmer probably shot all his scenes 
   in two or three days, since his screen time is limited to a few 
   minutes in the beginning and during the finale. The practical makeup 
   effects (by Todd Masters) are well done (although some of the CGI 
   parasites are iffy), but as we have learned time and time again, it's 
   the story that matters, not the effects (this is no longer the 
   early-80's) and, besides the last minute surprise revelation, <B><A HREF="thaw_2009b.htm">THE

    the fourth is beheaded with an axe.) The next morning Pa blames 
   Billy for the killings and tells him to go to the city, see a show

   listens to a rock band (American Xpress), gets drunk and meets a 
   waitress named Sherry (Sherry Steiner), who takes him to her pad to 
   sleep it off. They fall in love and Billy brings her home to meet Pa. 
   Big mistake. Pa says to Billy, &quot;Strange things happen when 
   you're around women&quot;, to which Billy replies, &quot;I'm no 
   killer!&quot; It turns out Billy is right as Pa reveals that he is 
   the killer. In a twist ending, it is revealed that Billy's mother is 
   still alive and suffers from a cannibalistic disease. Pa was killing 
   the women to satisfy her craving for human flesh and blaming Billy 
   for the crimes. Though somewhat padded, this film has an overall 
   creepy quality you just can't shake. It is also surprising in many

   his eyes ripped-out, another is impaled by a pendulum (what a 
   pendulum is doing in a temple is never explained), still another has 
   her throat cut and another is bitten by a bunch of poisonous spiders. 
   The finale finds the revived high priest about to sacrifice the 
   virginal Liz to finally complete the ritual he started two thousand 
   years earlier. Can the Professor stop him before it's too late? Does 
   anyone care at this point?&nbsp; Where to begin? First off, the whole 
   shot-on-digital video look gives the film (an ultra-low-budget 
   rip-off of Universal's <B><A HREF="mummy_1999.htm">THE MUMMY</A></B> 
   [1999] remake) a soap opera-ish feel, which is never a good thing. 
   Even though some of the Philippines location scenery is quite 
   fetching, the SOV look makes it all seem rather flat and 
   one-dimensional, lacking the depth that shooting on film would allow.

    OF DARKNESS</A></B> (1992) and other A-list films to pad out this 
   flick's 92 minute running time. Never mind that these film inserts 
   stick out like a sore thumb, Mattei would rather you not dwell on 
   that. The fact is, I could overlook these faults (including the 
   terrible dubbing) if the film was at least fun or remotely 
   interesting, but it's a boring mess, where the characters always do 
   the stupidest things humanly possible (When one guy loses his 
   glasses, he just gives up all hope and whines like a baby!) and the 
   film has so many factual errors (Ancient Aztec women wore thong 
   underwear? Mummification rites involved wristwatch-wearing warriors? 
   Who knew?), it's laughable. If I had to say something good about this 
   film (and that a big if), it would be that some of the makeup effects 
   were well done (effects by Davide Chiesa and Alessandro Franceschini 
   of Logical Art), but that's faint praise indeed. No one really needs 
   to see this. American expatriate and Filipino film staple Mike Monty 
   was the Dialogue Coach. Also starring Gyorgy Szabados, Ann Maxwell, 
   Mark Rambert, Faith Lowe, Frank Barber, Juliette Junot, Kenny Krall,

   total amateur hour. Besides erroneously reporting the running time as 
   110 minutes (I would have put a bullet in my head if I actually had 
   to watch an additional eighteen minutes of this dung pile), the DVD 
   menu looks like it was burned on a home DVD recorder! <B>Not </B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">R</FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B>ated</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

   before and asks the doctor what he thinks. Before he can answer, 
   Indian mystic Raman (director/co-screenwriter Antonio Boccaci, as 
   &quot;William Gray&quot;) arrives at the crime scene and talks to old 
   friend Dr. Darnell, telling him that he has been away for a few 
   years, but he has returned, for reasons not yet clear. It seems Dr. 
   Darnell has returned to the village, too, to take care of daughter 
   Anna (Annie Alberti, as &quot;Annie Albert&quot;), who is in the 
   carriage. The doctor introduces Raman to his daughter and when he 
   sees her, only one word comes out of his mouth: &quot;Irene&quot;. 
   Yes, Anna is the spitting image of Countess Irene and Raman is so 
   taken aback, he excuses himself and leaves. We then see Hugo walking 
   the castle grounds and entering the castle through a secret 
   passageway (every castle has one). We then discover that Dr. Darnell 
   has brought Anna to the village to solve a medical mystery. Anna has 
   been having a recurring nightmare where she is Countess Irene and is 
   in the castle's crypt, where a bearded hermit is chasing her. A man 
   calls out Irene's name and he is killed by someone wearing a suit of 
   armor, beating the man over his head with a club. When the person in 
   the armor lifts up the visor, the nightmare ends, Anna never seeing 
   the person's face. This nightmare has made Anna emotionally sick. 
   Every time she has this nightmare it takes her longer to wake up. Dr. 
   Darnell is worried that one day soon she will never wake up from this 
   nightmare, because it has taken her over three hours to wake up from 
   it yesterday. He hopes that if they find out what happened to 
   Countess Irene twenty years ago, Anna will be cured and the nightmare 
   will end (Just go along with it). Raman tells Dr. Darnell that he has 
   returned to the village to find out who murdered Countess Irene, 
   because he was in love with her and he knows that if she was alive 
   she would have found some way to contact him. He thinks it is too 
   dangerous for the doctor and his daughter to be here and says it 
   might be better if they left the village immediately, but Dr. Darnell

   meddling in their business. Elizabeth then talks to Anna, telling her 
   that &quot;they&quot; killed Irene and they're going to kill her,

   hidden treasure in the castle and that's the reason why Raman 
   returned to the village (He was once Elizabeth's lover, but the real 
   reason why he came back was to find Irene's body and find out who 
   killed her, if she is really dead.). Anna tells George that she 
   thinks she is going insane and believes she is the reincarnation of 
   Irene, but George tells her not to be silly, soon they will leave the 
   village and get married (Boy, he moves fast!). They then make love 
   while daddy is away on business for the night. Anna begs George not 
   to go to the castle and he tells her if she marries a reporter, she 
   should know that he goes where the story is and this story has 
   everything to do with the castle. While Anna is asleep, George sneaks 
   into castle, admires Ann....err, Irene's picture and almost becomes a

    This obscure little Italian Gothic horror film, directed/co-written

   much is known about Boccaci, as this is his only directing and acting 
   credit and he wrote the screenplays to three other equally obscure 
   films in the '60s, ending with Alfonso Brescia's spaghetti western <B><A HREF="days_of_violence_1967.htm">DAYS
    OF VIOLENCE</A></B> (1967). But this is a passable chiller with some 
   effective scenes and unexpected humor. When Officer Dobson tells Dr. 
   Darnell that he doesn't trust Raman and wants to know what he thinks 
   about him, the good doctor tells the officer that what he needs is an 
   enema to flush the crap out of his system! (something unusual for a 
   film made in 1963). This black &amp; white film seems to have been 
   converted to sepia-tone, as most scenes have a light brown tint to 
   them. I'm sure it is not a bad print because the picture is sharp and 
   clear and the sepia adds a little character to the flick, especially 
   in the dungeon scenes. But this film is about secrets, as everyone 
   seems to be harboring one or two that's integral to the plot. It's 
   not hard to figure out who Irene's killer is and the &quot;tomb of 
   torture&quot; in the film's title does come into play during the 
   film's finale, where Elizabeth chains Anna to the dungeon wall and 
   orders Hugo to kill her, but he can't because he was in love with 
   Irene and his tiny monster brain believes Anna is Irene. George and 
   Raman use the secret passageway to save Anna and Hugo knocks out 
   Raman, but when he goes to kill George, Anna's pleas stop him from 
   doing so. We then find out it was Elizabeth in the suit of armor and 
   she killed Irene, putting her body in an empty tomb in the crypt, 
   which Raman finds (which results in Elizabeth's death), ending his 
   search for the truth. Hugo begins to act like Quasimodo, swinging on 
   some chains attached to the ceiling. He gets a little too carried 
   away and ends up hanging himself when one of those chains wraps 
   around his neck. Hugo is nothing by a horror film cliche, but his 
   makeup is appropriately grotesque. While nothing remarkable, this is 
   an OK time-waster if you have nothing else to watch.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   happen such as tenants disappearing, finding a box of teeth in a hole 
   in the wall and the sound of power tools in the middle of the night. 
   Steve, who is a hospital resident, spends most of his time at his job 
   so Nell must find out the cause of all the problems she is

   tenants screaming for her life (the lady has been literally nailed to 
   the wall with an air hammer) and they bust down the door, the police 
   find nothing (she has been nailed to the ceiling out of view) and 
   chalk it up to Nell having a vivid imagination. More murders occur, 
   including her new friend Julia (Juliet Landau) getting power-drilled 
   through the head, another female tenant getting a claw hammer rammed 
   through her chin, the building's maintenance man (co-screenwriter 
   Adam Gierasch) getting his head cut in half at the jaw line with a 
   portable circular saw, the doorman (Marco Rodriguez) getting his head 
   squeezed in a vise while acid is poured on his face and the manager 
   (Greg Travis) getting his spinal cord cut in half with bolt cutters 
   (after screaming, &quot;Kill me already!&quot;). Nell finds an ally 
   in long-time resident Chas Rooker (genre great Rance Howard [<B><A HREF="ticks_1993.htm">TICKS</A></B> 
   - 1993]), who leads her in the right direction by pointing out that 
   none of the apartment floors have a Room 4. There's also some strange 
   supernatural symbols on each floor in which Nell discovers that the 
   building has a separate smaller building hidden inside it! It all 
   leads to a rather rushed conclusion that has something to do with a 
   &quot;Coffin Baby&quot; (Chris Doyle, who looks like a cousin of <B><A HREF="darkman_1990.htm">DARKMAN</A></B>

   stays alive by killing the residents for the past six decades. This 
   is the part that is woefully underwritten and spoils the finale of 
   the film. It also leaves the film wide open for a sequel. On the plus 
   side, there's the competent acting by the cast, moody murder scenes, 
   some jump-scares and the building itself, which seems to have a life 
   of it's own. Sherri Moon (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#House 1000 Corpses">HOUSE

   (1993), but no where near as good as his 70's classics. While the 
   film is rated R, the extras on the DVD have deleted scenes which 
   include the extended and much gorier versions of the death scenes,

   scene which shows that Rance Howard's character was probably a ghost.

   objections) since she has dealt with the Rovers before. They should 
   have listened to Ford, because Neon is actually a member (possibly 
   even the leader) of the Rovers. She begins separating the survivors 
   so the other Rovers can kill them. The fight for survival is extreme, 
   but Dakota fights back using a bow and arrow until she faces-off with 
   Neon in the finale. May the best bitch win!&nbsp; This is a 
   well-made, but bland, low-budget horror film that doesn't offer 
   anything new or radically different from any other low-budget horror 
   film. Director/screenwriter/editor Mark Young (<B><A HREF="southern_gothic_2006.htm">SOUTHERN

   of the film is nothing but people running, hiding, talking and dying 
   throughout the hospital's dingy corridors and rooms. While the blood

   pull off), a baseball bat full of nails to the cranium, an axe to the

   copying many of the gore effects that fake film had! While the acting 
   here is OK (although it's obvious that Madsen, Jones and Carradine 
   were probably only available for a day's-worth of shooting time), the 
   film just plods along until it's &quot;surprise&quot; reveal, which 
   anyone with half a brain could see coming a mile away. The dialogue 
   contains such embarrassing exchanges like: <B>Dakota:</B> &quot;I'm 
   going to kill you!&quot; <B>Neon:</B> &quot;Not if I eat you 
   first!&quot; or this monologue between a cannibal and his rumbling

   of hours. Nice, tasty meat! Yum, yum!&quot; so be prepared to shake

   recommend here unless you're a fan of generic stalk 'n' slash

   Degenerate gambler Lester Parson (Brett Halsey; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Demonia1990">DEMONIA</A></B> 
   - 1990), who has a thing for the horses, cooks a steak and then eats 
   it, sharing it with his cat Reginald, telling him not to worry, he 
   will always get his share. We then see a dead woman lying naked on a 
   table in another room of Lester's house, a piece of her flesh missing 
   from her upper thigh in the same shape as the<A HREF="touch_of_death_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/touch of death dvd front9a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   steak Lester just ate. Lester then enters the room, grabs an electric 
   chainsaw and cuts off the woman's arms, head and legs (in that order. 
   I don't know if this was intentional or not, but when he turns on the 
   electric chainsaw we hear a gas-powered chainsaw on the soundtrack. 
   Electric chainsaws do not make that noise. It could be an in-joke or 
   sloppy looping, but I believe it's the former, for reasons that will 
   become abundantly clear as the film progresses). Yes, Lester Parsons 
   is a cannibal, a modern-day Bluebeard who romances rich, lonely women 
   and then kills them, cooks them and eats them after robbing them 
   blind. He may be a gambler, but he's not a good one, losing big on 
   the ponies. He asks his bookie, Randy (&quot;Al Cliver&quot;; <B><A HREF="beyond_1981.htm">THE
    BEYOND</A></B> - 1981; who uses his real name, Pier Luigi Conti, 
   here), for a loan, but he refuses, telling Lester he will just lose 
   it at the races and he won't be able to pay it back.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Lester searches through the lonely-hearts ads in the newspaper to 
   look for a new conquest. We then see him in bed with an extremely 
   ugly middle-aged woman named Margie Holt (Sasha Darwin; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#VoicesFromBeyond91">VOICES
    FROM BEYOND</A></B> - 1991), who has a noticeable dark mustache, 
   discolored skin on her face and two large black moles on her right 
   breast! While she moans in pleasure, Lester has a look of disgust on 
   his face; every kiss he plants on her naked body makes him gag 
   silently (It's quite funny, as well as extremely hard to watch). 
   Later on, he decides to murder a drunk Margie by drugging her drink, 
   but every time she is about to swallow it, something happens, so she 
   doesn't. She gets suspicious when he makes her drink a drugged glass 
   of bicarbonate of soda (holding her nose and pouring it down her 
   throat) and she gets sick, runs to the bathroom and then throws up. 
   Lester has had enough, so he picks up a wood tree branch and smashes 
   her over the head repeatedly until her brain matter spills to the 
   floor, but she still refuses to die (!), forcing Lester to put her 
   head into the microwave oven and turning it on, watching her face 
   melt away (That's not how a microwave works. Even in early models, 
   safety precautions were taken where the door must be completely 
   closed before you could turn it on! Another in-joke, perhaps?). 
   Lester then puts her dead body in the trunk of his car (She still 
   makes his life difficult, for every time he goes to close the trunk, 
   her foot pops up to block it from closing, forcing him to cut off her 
   feet!) and dumps it at a construction site, covering her body in wet 
   cement. When Lester gets back in his car, he is surprised to see that 
   a tramp (Marco Di Stefano; <B><A HREF="action.htm#ApocalypseMercs1987">APOCALYPSE
    MERCENARIES</A></B> - 1987) was sleeping in the back seat. He tells 
   Lester that he saw him dumping a body, so he gives the tramp money to 
   keep his mouth shut, but when the tramp gets out of the car, Lester 
   runs him over repeatedly, the tires crushing his head like a 
   watermelon. It seems that Lester is not only a gambler and a 
   cannibal, he's also quite psychotic and may also have someone who is 
   copycatting his murders and pointing to Lester as the culprit. This 
   voice begins making Lester's life very difficult, not only talking to 
   him over the radio (which he tapes on a cassette to make sure it is 
   real), but also threatening him over the phone, giving him advice on 
   how to live his life. Is it possible that all this is real and not 
   happening in his twisted mind?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Lester goes to a fence to hock Margie's jewelry, he discovers 
   it is only worthless costume junk, forcing him once again to find 
   another rich woman in the lonely-hearts ads, this time a middle-aged 
   opera singer named Alice Shogun (Ria De Simone; <B><A HREF="womens_camp_119_1977.htm">WOMEN'S
    CAMP 119</A></B> - 1977), who likes to be slapped in the face and is 
   into S &amp; M sex. Alice also sings loudly while she sleeps (!), 
   keeping Lester up all night, so he strangles her in her sleep with a 
   whip (a sex toy they apparently used that night). Once again, her 
   dead body proves to be difficult for Lester when he puts it in the 
   front passenger seat of his car (she keeps slumping over, even when 
   he straps her in the seatbelt and shoulder harness!). It's nearly 
   curtains for Lester when he is stopped by a cop for going under the 
   speed limit (!), Alice strapped in the front seat, but he gets away 
   by the skin of his teeth.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Lester is getting sloppy and worries that the police are closing in, 
   blaming the copycat killer for it, so he goes to Randy to place 
   another bet, only to be told by Randy that the shop is closed because 
   the police are tapping his phones. Randy has a poker game going on in 
   his office and Lester joins in, only to lose all of Alice's money and 
   a whole lot more. Randy gives him a week to pay it back, if he 
   doesn't, pain, and a whole lot more, are in his future.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Lester continues to get phone calls from the copycat, telling him, 
   &quot;My fate is linked to yours.&quot; Lester wants to meet him, 
   only to be told, &quot;Forget it. It will mean the end of you.&quot; 
   Lester is willing to take that chance (he is a betting man, after 
   all) and asks the voice where he is located. &quot;Nearer than you 
   can ever imagine. I can almost say we are close enough to touch&quot;,
    says the voice on the other end. Then the phone goes dead (after the 
   curtains in Lester's living room blow open). Lester thinks that Randy 
   is somehow involved in all of this, yet when he goes to Randy's 
   office (located above a horse stable), he finds a &quot;For Sale&quot;
    sign hanging on the door. Lester breaks in and discovers that a cat 
   still lives there and the more he searches, he begins to realize the 
   person who lived there leads a life remarkably like his own, scaring 
   the shit out of him, yet he is too psychotic to realize that his 
   worst enemy is himself.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Lester gets a phone call from a woman named Virginia Fields (Zora 
   Kerova; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NewYorkRipper1982">THE NEW YORK RIPPER</A></B> 
   - 1982; billed here as &quot;Zora Ulla Kesler&quot;), who seemingly 
   called the wrong number (she is very beautiful, but has a disgusting 
   harelip). She tells Lester he has a nice voice, just like her dead 
   husband and jokingly says she wishes to hire him to wake her up every 
   morning. Lester tells her that would be an expensive proposition and 
   Virginia says that isn't a problem, her dead husband left her a lot 
   of money. Is Lester extremely lucky or is he being set up? Is there 
   actually a copycat murderer? Why doesn't Lester cast a shadow? If you 
   want to know the answers to these questions I'm afraid you'll have to

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    What I found fascinating about this film is that 
   director/screenwriter Lucio Fulci (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CityLivingDead1980">CITY
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> - 1980; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackCat1981">THE
    BLACK CAT</A></B> - 1981; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Aenigma1987">AENIGMA</A></B> 
   - 1987) shows a sure hand at comedy. Sure, it's pretty dark humor, 
   but it's funny nonetheless. What I especially found funny is that 
   Lester seems to pick women with deformities that he has a hard time 
   dealing with, be it physical or mental deformities, making his time 
   with them before he kills them just as painful for him as the end is 
   for them. Of course, none of this would have worked if it wasn't for 
   the talents of Brett Halsey (Fulci's <B><A HREF="devils_honey_1986.htm">THE
    DEVIL'S HONEY</A></B> - 1986), for, even though his voice is dubbed 
   (the dulcet tones of maestro dubber Nick Alexander), his facial 
   expressions and body language imbue Lester with just enough menace to 
   go along with his finely-tuned comic performance (His expression when 
   kissing Virginia is worth the price of admission alone). He's 
   actually a revelation here and I have never seen him do better. What 
   is also surprising about this film is that it was made for Italian 
   television, yet it is full of gory violence and female nudity (but 
   none of it titillating in the least), unlike most of Fulci's other TV 
   movies, which include <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#SodomasGhost">SODOMA'S

   (See my <A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CatInTheBrain">review</A> for more 
   information). I didn't expect to like this film, since most of 
   Fulci's later ones are less than stellar, but this one surprised me 
   pleasantly. I love being surprised and I recommend you search for 
   this film and give it a chance. You should like it, too, especially 
   if you appreciate black humor (and a well done closing scene that 
   involves Lester's shadow).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    TOUCH OF SATAN</A><A NAME="TouchOfSatan"></A> (1971) -</B> This will 
   forever be known as the horror film that many people thought Billy 
   Jack directed. They would be wrong. After a brutal pitchfork murder 
   of an old prospector in a barn, we are introduced to the Strickland 
   family, who seem to be harboring some deep, dark secret. Driving into 
   town is young Jodie Thompson (Michael Berry), who is warned by the 
   gas station attendant that a &quot;fromicidal maniac&quot; is on the 
   loose. Jodie stops by a pond to eat lunch and meets Melissa 
   Strickland (Emby Mellay). They strike up a conversation and Melissa 
   invites him home (it's a walnut farm!) for dinner with her family. 
   Melissa's father, Luther (Lee Amber), is wary of Jodie's presence (He 
   says to Melissa, &quot;You didn't 'call' him, did you?&quot;) and 
   after dinner, when Jodie accepts Melissa's offer to spend the night, 
   it worries Luther and Melissa's mom, Molly (Yvonne Winslow), even 
   more. It's not long before Jodie and Melissa fall in love, which 
   worries Mom and Pop on even a larger level, as th<A HREF="touch_of_satan_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/touch of satan vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ey
    try to hide the hideously-burned and old (and seemingly insane) 
   family member Lucinda Strickland (Jeanne Gerson) from Jodie, but she 
   sneaks into his bedroom and warns him to &quot;Go away!&quot; 
   Lucinda's old, burned face scares Jodie, but Melissa explains that 
   her great-grandmother is harmless. It's quite clear that all is not 
   right with the Strickland family, especially with Melissa, when we 
   see her go into Lucinda's room and she calls her &quot;my 
   sister&quot;. There's also talk between Mom and Pop that Jodie may be 
   &quot;the one&quot; and Melissa says, &quot;We'll have to wait and 
   see&quot;. After a trip to town, where all the people stare at the 
   couple, Melissa reveals to Jodie that she is a witch, but he doesn't 
   believe her. She takes him to a secret cabin in the woods, where she 
   goes to practice her craft. Lucinda gets loose and murders a snooping 
   cop (Lew Horn) with a baling hook. Luther locks Jodie in the barn 
   after he sees the cop's bloody body. Jodie agrees to keep his mouth 
   shut as long as Melissa leaves with him tomorrow, which triggers a 
   flashback that tells the Strickland's backstory. During the early 
   19th Century, Lucinda was being burned as a witch when sister Melissa 
   makes a deal with the Devil (who speaks in a voice that sounds eerily 
   similar to Melissa's) to save her. Melissa never grows old but, this 
   being a deal with the Devil, Lucinda continues to age but not die. 
   Melissa hopes that Jodie will be the one that is able to break this 
   spell. She makes love to Jodie and turns old in front of his eyes. 
   Melissa is finally free of the spell, but Jodie makes a deal with the 
   Devil (who sounds eerily like Jodie) to make her young again. The 
   Devil wins every time.&nbsp; It doesn't take a genius to figure out 
   what is going on here, but director Don Henderson, (the sexploitation 
   films <B><A HREF="babysitter_weekend_babysitter_1969_1970.htm">THE BABYSITTER</A></B> 
   [1969] and it's sequel <B><A HREF="babysitter_weekend_babysitter_1969_1970.htm">WEEKEND
    WITH THE BABYSITTER</A></B> [1970]), films everything with a sense 
   of loneliness and dread, as if something bad could happen at any time 
   (Some people believe that Don Henderson was a pseudonym for <B><A HREF="billy_jack_1971.htm">BILLY
    JACK</A></B> himself, Tom Laughlin, but that is not true. Henderson 
   produced Laughlin's <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Born Losers">THE 
   BORN LOSERS</A></B> [1967], the very first Billy Jack film, which 
   Laughlin directed using the name &quot;T.C. Frank&quot; and people 
   believed that Henderson was another of Laughlin's pseudonyms, a rumor 
   that was proven wrong.). This GP-rated (later PG) film is fairly 
   bloody in spots (when the cop is killed, the blood flows rather 
   freely), but that wasn't uncommon in 70's horror cinema (just look at 
   1970's <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Blood And Lace">BLOOD AND LACE</A></B>,
    which may be the goriest PG film ever made). What is unusual in a 
   film like this is the long, 360 degree tracking shot that Henderson 
   utilizes just after the cop is killed. The camera spins in a circle, 
   but stays focused on Melissa's worried face, as we hear Molly and 
   Luther clean up the crime scene. It's quite an effective sequence 
   that conveys a lot of emotion. Joe Blasco (<B><A HREF="ilsa_she_wolf_of_the_ss_1974.htm">ILSA:
    SHE-WOLF OF THE SS</A></B> - 1974) has one of his earliest special 
   makeup effects credits here. His old-age burn makeup on Lucinda is 
   excellent as are his other gore effects. While this is a slow-moving 
   horror film, patient viewers will be rewarded. This use to play

   opens with Woody (Keith McDermott) rolling a spare tire in need of 
   air down a dirt road until he gets to a rundown gas station/museum 
   called &quot;Slausen's Lost Oasis And Old West Museum&quot; in the 
   middle of nowhere. Woody's girlfriend, Eileen (Robin Sherwood), waits

    GREAT TEXAS DYNAMITE CHASE</A></B> - 1976), drive by and rescue her 
   and then go looking for Woody, who enters the dilapidated museum, 
   hears what sounds like female moaning and decides to investigate. 
   Poor Woody, he didn't stand a chance. He enters a back room, is 
   attacked by a bunch of cackling mannequins (whose mouths open and 
   close in the most frightening way) and all the objects in the room 
   either shake or fly through the air, including a piece of lead pipe, 
   which impales Woody through his back and he dies (as blood flows out 
   of the open end of the pipe). Jerry and his friends arrive at 
   Slausen's Lost Oasis (all of them missing the &quot;Closed To The 
   Public&quot; sign with a live vulture roosting on it!) and their Jeep 
   suddenly goes on the fritz (since this movie was made before cell 
   phones and their lack of signals, the &quot;car failing to start&quot;
    routine was the most popular convenient inconvenience in horror 
   films), but the girls find a beautiful waterfall and lake a few 
   hundred yard away and decide to go skinny-dipping, only to be 
   interrupted by a smiling, shotgun-toting Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Mad Bomber">THE
    MAD BOMBER</A></B> - 1972), who seems to take a keen interest in 
   Molly, the most prim and proper of the three girls, and to warn them 
   to leave the area before it gets dark (the lake fills up with deadly 
   water moccasins at nighttime). Mr. Slausen drives Jerry and the girls 
   to his museum, where Eileen asks about all the lifelike mannequins 
   that litter the place. Mr. Slausen explains that they were all 
   created by his brother, who was lured away to the big city (&quot;He's
    out there still making dummies for one of them wax museums.&quot;) 
   and shows them the intricate mechanics of one of the Old West 
   mannequins. When Mr. Slausen and Jerry go to fix his Jeep, Eileen 
   finds that the phone doesn't work (Slausen says, &quot;I ain't got 
   nobody to call.&quot;), so she decides to check out Slausen's home 
   (which is separate from the museum) all by herself to look for 
   another phone (big mistake). She discovers a house full of mannequins 
   and one that is dressed as Woody, who telekinetically strangles Eil<A HREF="tourist_trap_1979c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/tourist trap dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="187" HEIGHT="271" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>een
    with a scarf while all the objects in the room shatter or fly 
   through the air. It's quite obvious by now that Mr. Slausen is hiding 
   a deadly secret and when he returns to the museum without Jerry and 
   starts talking about his dearly departed wife (he keeps an eerie wax 
   likeness of her in the museum and she looks somewhat like Molly), 
   it's clear that he has more than one screw loose (When he goes to the 
   house to find Eileen, he discovers she has been turned into a 
   mannequin). What is the secret of Slausen's Lost Oasis and what power 
   does Mr. Slausen have that lets him control the mannequins? More 
   people will die before the secret is revealed, but will anyone 
   survive and will they be sane?&nbsp; Since this film is a fine

    TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN</A><A NAME="TownDreadSundown14"></A> 
   (2014) -</B> I have to say that I went into this film with a lot of 
   trepidation, since I simply love director Charles B. Pierce's <A HREF="town_that_dreaded_sundown_1976.htm">1976
    film of the same name</A>, which was based on a true series of 
   murders that terrified the town of Texarkana (which is located in 
   both Texas and Arkansas and shares two mayors, two councils, two 
   police forces, etc.) in the late 1940's &amp; early-1950's, that was 
   never solved. A serial killer with a burlap sack on his head (with 
   two eye-holes cut out), simply called &quot;The Phantom&quot;, killed 
   a bunch of people by various means and then disappeared. But as soon 
   as I saw the Orion Pictures logo on the screen (the first time it has 
   been used in a motion picture in over 15 years, since director Lance 
   Hool's <B><A HREF="one_mans_hero_1999.htm">ONE MAN'S HERO</A></B> in 
   1999), I knew that I was in for something different. What I didn't 
   know is how much I would enjoy it since it pays tribute to the true 
   story and Charles B. Pierce's film and in a way that should please 
   those who love the 1976 film, as well as gorehounds. The film opens 
   up with a narrator explaining the true events that went on in 
   Texarkana (just in case you were not familiar with it) and then goes 
   on to explain that when Charles B. Pierce made the film in their town 
   in 1976, it became a town tradition to screen the film every 
   Halloween and in 2013 it was the Twin Star Drive-In's turn (on the 
   Arkansas side) to screen the film, where the Reverend Cartwright 
   (Edward Herrmann, in his last film) pickets the film and hands out 
   flyers telling everyone to stop watching the film and come to his 
   church on Sunday to confess their sins (it turns out that he is a 
   real scumbag later on in the film). Jami (Addison Timlin), an 
   aspiring writer who lost her parents in a <A HREF="town_that_dreaded_sundown_2014b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/town that dreaded sundown 2014 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>car
    wreck years earlier, and Corey (Spencer Treat Clark), are watching 
   the film, but Jami doesn't want to be there and agrees to go to 
   Lover's Lane with Corey to make out. When they arrive there and are 
   just about to get busy, The Phantom appears and makes both Jami and 
   Corey get out of the car. He tells Jami to turn around and not look, 
   as he makes Corey drop his pants and lie on the ground. Just when you 
   think Corey is about to be sodomized, The Phantom repeatedly stabs 
   him in the back over and over and Jami turns around. The Phantom 
   says, &quot;You looked.&quot; and chases her through the woods. He 
   finally catches her, but instead of killing her, he tells her, 
   &quot;This is for Mary. Make them understand.&quot; When Jami walks 
   out of the woods and Corey's body is found by the Jim Bowie statue in 
   the middle of town (with a burlap sack on its head), the police 
   Chiefs of both sides of town, Chief Deputy Tillman (Gary Cole) and 
   Sheriff Underwood (the late Ed Lauter, in one of his final films), 
   question Jami and decide that they don't want to start another panic 
   in town like in the 40's, so they keep things hushed up and Jami goes 
   home to Lillian (Veronica Cartwright), her grandmother, who was alive 
   when the original murders happened and is very open about telling her 
   everything she remembers about the original killings and the movie 
   being made in town in 1976. Deputy Foster (Joshua Leonard) is 
   assigned to keep an eye on Lillian's house and follow Jami around to 
   make sure she is safe. The town will soon be in panic mode once 
   again, when a returning Marine and his girlfriend (who is about to 
   propose to him!) are screwing in a motel room and she asks her 
   sweetheart to get her some cookies from the vending machine outside. 
   As she is setting up the proposal, the Marine's severed head comes 
   crashing through the front window, followed by The Phantom, who 
   chases the girl (who jumps out the bathroom window and has a huge 
   piece of glass impaled in her ankle) to her car and stabs her 
   repeatedly. The town holds a community meeting, where both mayors 
   assure everyone that the film will no longer be shown and it can't be 
   the original Phantom, because he would be over a hundred years-old. A 
   drunk in the audience (more about him later) says he knew this was 
   going to happen. It was only a matter of time. Enter Texas Ranger 
   Lone Wolf Morales (Anthony Anderson), who announces that he will now 
   be taking over the investigation (he is a composite of the real Texas 
   Ranger in the 40's and Ben Johnson's character in the 1976 film) and 
   needs all the files, as well as a copy of the film, which he has 
   never seen! The town holds a vigil at the high school for Corey, the 
   Marine and his girlfriend, which Jami attends and &quot;The 
   Phantom&quot; appears and is shot to death by a Marine attending the 
   vigil. It is announced at a town dinner that The Phantom has been 
   killed and the band there starts playing some old-time dance music. 
   After the dinner, two gay teens in the band decide to drive to the 
   old sign graveyard (it is quite the sight) for their first encounter 
   with homosexuality (the conversation between the two is hilarious and 
   they do it in front of an old sign featuring the Reverend 
   Cartwright's image), when The Phantom appears (turns out the one that 
   was killed at the vigil was a college kid who left a suicide note in 
   his dorm room) and smashes one boy in the face until it is a bloody 
   pulp (he then finishes him off by shooting him in the head with a 
   silencer) and ties the other boy up and does the trombone murder 
   scene that is in the first movie, only this one is much, much 
   bloodier. Deputy Tillman is shot in the eye by The Phantom while 
   getting oral sex from a bar floozy in his home (You haven't lived 
   until you see the look on Gary Cole's face as he is getting a 
   blowjob!) and the floozy is chased outside into a cornfield, murdered 
   and left hanging like a scarecrow. Meanwhile, Jami and new friend 
   Nick (Travis Tope), who works at the local newspaper's research 
   department, find out some vital information about the murders thanks 
   to tracking down Charles B. Pierce Jr. (character actor supreme Denis 
   O'Hare, who also supplied the film's opening narration), the son of 
   the film director, who was the drunk we saw in the audience. He tells 
   them that the final murder by the original Phantom was never 
   reported. His name was Hank McCreedy and he was found cut to pieces 
   on the railroad tracks, so the authorities said that he was The 
   Phantom and stopped the investigation (since no more killings 
   happened again). This drove McCreedy's wife Mary to suicide and 
   Pierce Jr. says that it is McCreedy's grandson who is committing all 
   these bloody crimes. To say any more will be to ruin a great ending 
   (let me just say that I was half surprised, as I have given you the 
   clues you need to figure it out at least one part of it), but it is a 
   satisfying conclusion until the final freeze-frame, which then leaves 
   the film open for a sequel (Why do they always have to do that?). 
   This is director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon's feature film debut (he 
   directed many episodes of the wonderful TV anthology series <B><A HREF="american_horror_story_tv_series_2011.htm">AMERICAN
    HORROR STORY</A></B>) and he does an excellent job here, even 
   throwing in some seat-raising jump scares. The camera breezes though 
   some scenes like it is floating through the air (the cornfield scene 
   is really impressive) and there is no quick editing, as the camera 
   lingers on some of the killings for longer than some people can 
   endure (this is a good thing). The screenplay, by Roberto 
   Aguirre-Sacasa (<B><A HREF="carrie_2013.htm">CARRIE</A></B> - 2013), 
   is repectful to the late Charles B. Pierce's film (although I'm not 
   too sure he would like his son being depicted as a drunk), even 
   incorporating some scenes from the film into the murders thanks to 
   cross-editing (the trombone murder for one) and when Lone Wolf 
   watches the film for the first time on VHS (I guess they didn't get 
   the <A HREF="town_that_dreaded_sundown_1977_the_evictors_1979_blu-ray_and_dvd.htm">Scream
    Factory Blu-Ray</A>!), where Lone Wolf seems transfixed on the Ben 
   Johnson character (One of the very many homages to the original film 
   that are sprinkled and hidden throughout this film. See how many you 
   can find. I'll give you one more: A character named 
   &quot;Sparkplug&quot; is briefly seen and mentioned by name.). The 
   screenplay has everyone but one person being killed because they are 
   having or talking about sex, a throwback to 80's slasher films. 
   Another plus for this film is the excellent actors that were 
   assembled for this film, something unusual for a movie of this type 
   (and even sadder when two of them would make this film their 
   swansong) and it makes the film better than it has any right to be. 
   Everyone here is a joy, especially Addison Timlin, who plays her part 
   with just the right amount of sadness (she is the cause of her 
   parents' deaths) and need to be accepted in town, even if it means 
   having sex with someone popular when she doesn't really want to (and 
   then gets called a slut by Corey's mother at his wake!). Look for a 
   poster of <B><A HREF="boxcar_bertha_1972.htm">BOXCAR BERTHA</A></B> 
   (1972) in a theater scene. If you want to see how a modern horror 
   film can be done right (and some of the gore and nudity pushes the 
   R-Rating to the limits), you could do a lot worse than this one.

    A group of four young adults (i.e. hippies) are on a luxurious 
   sailboat owned by Bill's (Tony Isbert; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DraculaSaga1973">THE
    DRACULA SAGA</A></B> - 1973) rich father, enjoying life, playing 
   guitar and getting tans. Bill lives on his family's money and Joe 
   (Maximo Valverde; <B><A HREF="hotel_fear_1977.htm">HOTEL FEAR</A></B> 
   - 1978) makes sure that Bill knows it. As they go to shore, Bill 
   hands Joe and Fred (Giovanni Petrucci; <B><A HREF="death_rides_a_horse_1967.htm">DEATH
    RIDES A HORSE</A></B> - 1967) some travelers checks for helping him 
   on this outing and even offers to pay Jane (Camille Keaton; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WhatDoneSolange1972">WHAT
    HAVE YOU DONE TO SOLANGE?</A></B> - 1972) some money, but she 
   refuses, telling Bill that she's only here to &quot;enjoy life&quot;. 
   When Bill gets Jane alone, he gives her a very expensive pearl 
   necklace, which she gladly accepts. A flashback shows us that Bill 
   originally purchased the necklace for his mother (Irina Demick; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#NakedGirlPark1972">NAKED
    GIRL KILLED IN THE PARK</A></B> - 1972), but when he tells her that 
   the antiques dealer he brought the necklace from told him that the 
   original owner was a crazy woman who was possessed by the Devil and 
   it may be cursed, his mother no longer wants to wear it, putting it 
   in a drawer in her bedroom night table. It turns out Bill knew his 
   mother wouldn't want the necklace, so he steals it out of the night 
   table after spying on his mother naked in the bathroom bathtub 
   sharing a smoke with Joe! Back in the present, when Jane goes to kiss 
   Bill to thank him for the expensive gift, she suddenly has a vision, 
   seeing Bill's face a sickly blue color with eyes that are bleeding, 
   and runs away in fear. It turns out Jane is dating Joe and Bill is 
   not too pleased with it, thinking he can buy her love (Why doesn't 
   shit like this happen to me?).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The group of four go for a nighttime ride in Bill's dune buggy, but 
   they run out of gas. They push the dune buggy to the nearest gas 
   station, where the attendant (Jose Calvo; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#PriceOfPower1969">THE
    PRICE OF POWER</A></B> - 1969) refuses to give them any gas because 
   he believes the travelers checks Bill has are stolen since he left 
   his ID back in the tent at the campsite and can't prove his identity. 
   The attendant, who is an old prick, gives them a minute amount of gas 
   when Jane flashes her eyes at him, but they quickly run out of gas 
   again, only this time the buggy conks-out (in the pouring rain) next

   electronically and lets the foursome push the dune buggy into an open 
   garage, where a cherry vintage Rolls Royce also sits. Lord Alexander 
   then introduces himself and tells them that &quot;there's plenty of 
   what you are looking for here&quot;, but since it is pouring rain and 
   the dune buggy has no roof, they should come inside the villa, get 
   comfortable and wait for the storm to end. Jane is instantly 
   suspicious, especially when Lord Alexander says, &quot;Hospitality is 
   sacred here&quot;, but the quartet go inside anyway (after Bill fills 
   up the dune buggy with a canister of gas and it won't start). Lord 
   Alexander tells his wife that he let them in and they are now in the 
   garage, but Lady Alexander asks, &quot;And our friends?&quot; Lord 
   Alexander says their &quot;friends&quot; are waiting downstairs and 
   Lady Alexander smiles slyly.&nbsp; Something tells me that these 
   &quot;friends&quot; are not so friendly.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    After trying to push-start the buggy with no success, Lady Alexander 
   pulls Jane out of the pouring rain and into the villa, so the others 
   follow her inside. Joe makes himself at home, saying he's hungry and 
   grabbing some food out of the refrigerator without asking his hosts. 
   Lady Alexander takes a special interest in Jane, getting all 
   touchy-feely and running her a hot bath. Jane strops naked and Lady 
   Alexander secretly watches her, a look on her face as if she won the 
   lottery. We then find out that the 'friends&quot; are the members of 
   some cult, as they all wear black robes and kiss Lady Alexander's 
   hand. One member begins playing the organ and the lights go out in 
   the villa. Bill sees the gas station attendant staring at him through 
   a window and runs outside, but Joe and Fred don't see him and tell 
   Bill he imagined it. Jane gets out of the tub when she hears the 
   organ music and walks as if in some kind of a trance towards the 
   music (the other three don't hear the organ music because they are in 
   a different part of this large villa). We then learn that the cult 
   are Satan worshippers, as they chant, &quot;Prince of Darkness, once 
   in Heaven, now ruler in Hell. Hallowed be thy name. We elect you to 
   be our God.&quot; As Jane slowly walks to the cult's altar room, the 
   pearl necklace Bill gave her begins to burn her neck, so she pulls it 
   off, the beads of pearls spilling down the stone stairs. Maybe Bill 
   wasn't lying to his mother about the necklace. It may, indeed, be cursed!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Joe decides to explore the villa on his own (never a good thing), as 
   Lord Alexander picks up Jane and lays her on the altar. As Joe is 
   walking down the stone stairs towards the altar room, Bill and Fred 
   stop him, saying they found Jane's clothes, but not Jane. Then Bill 
   notices the beads of pearls scattered along the stairs and wonders if 
   Jane is in trouble. Joe tells Bill that they may not be Jane's pearls 
   at all and continue walking down the stairs to look for Jane. We then 
   see Lady Alexander standing next to a prone Jane, a ceremonial dagger 
   in her hand. Just as she is about to stab Jane in the heart with the 
   dagger, Bill stops her and a struggle ensues, resulting in Lady 
   Alexander stabbing herself in the stomach with the dagger and dying. 
   The trio rescue Jane and what happens next is not just totally 
   unexpected, it is also a gorehound's delight. A male member of the 
   cult begins shooting other members with a pistol, as Lord Alexander 
   grabs a sword and cleaves the pistol-carrying member's head in two. 
   An old female cult member grabs another pistol and shoots a male 
   member in the head, while still another male member grabs a sword and 
   cuts the old female's head off. It's nothing but a massacre in the 
   altar room as cult members begin killing other members. More deaths 
   ensue, as cult members are shot, one female falls head-first into a 
   fire (burning her face off!) and another takes a dive out of a second 
   story window to the pavement below (Wait a minute! I thought they 
   were in the villa's dungeon?). This is the film's gory highlight, as 
   the graphic deaths come up unexpectedly and quickly and are as bloody 
   (if not bloodier) as anything released today.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The quartet push-start the dune buggy (the storm is now over) and 
   drive off. After traveling a short distance, Bill stops the buggy so 
   they can collect their thoughts. Bill is sure he will be charged with 
   murder if they were to report what just happened to the police, so 
   they all agree not to say anything. Two cops on motorcycles approach 
   the foursome, so Bill hides behind some bushes. They ask what is 
   wrong and instead of telling them the truth, Jane says they are lost 
   and need directions. After the cops give them directions and leave, 
   Bill says the dune buggy needs some gas (Jesus, is this buggy a 
   gas-guzzler or does it have a hole in its gas tank?). So where do 
   they go? That's right, the same gas station they went to before, but 
   once they get there, it looks like the station hasn't been open for 
   decades, as the gas pumps are destroyed and rusting and the windows 
   are all broken. Just what in the Hell is going on here? Bill drives 
   his friends to his mother's house for a night of rest and relaxation, 
   only Mom tells Bill they cannot stay here, she has given the servants 
   the night off and none of the rooms are ready. She hands Bill some 
   money so they can all spend the night at a hotel. Do you think Mom 
   may be hiding something? Damn right she is, for as Bill and his 
   friends leave, Mom pulls Bill aside and tells him the pearl necklace 
   is missing and if he knows anything about it. Bill says no and wishes 
   her a good night. Like mother, like son, for as everyone leaves, Mom 
   turns out the lights and walks upstairs, where her lover, a young 
   man, is waiting for her (He makes a remark about Bill and may be one 
   of his friends!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When Joe asks Bill if they are going to a hotel, he says no, they 
   are going to his father's country home. Since the dune buggy is low 
   on gas, they take two motorcycles Bill keeps at his mother's house, 
   Jane on the back with Bill and Fred with Joe. We are then privy to a 
   conversation two cops are having when they stop their police car at 
   the deserted gas station. The gas station hasn't been in operation 
   for fifteen years and it is said the old attendant who worked there 
   still haunts the place. One of the cops remembers him as being very 
   generous, giving free gas to people who couldn't afford it, 
   especially if a young pretty girl was involved. The other cop 
   remembers him as being a &quot;lecher' who was always making unwanted 
   advances to pretty young girls. Is this important to the film? Damned 
   if I know!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The quartet makes it to the country estate, but Bill doesn't have a 
   key, so they break down the front door. They all believe they are 
   wanted for murder by the police and Bill blames the attendant for 
   leading them to the Alexander villa. They turn on the TV, where a 
   news report is airing live footage of the police and medical 
   personnel carrying the dead bodies away from the villa. The reporter 
   describes the crime scene as if &quot;a monster or steamroller had 
   passed suddenly through. And with bestial violence, it snuffed out, 
   in an atrocious manner, eight lives.&quot; The reporter goes on to 
   state that the crime scene looks like a Black Mass gone horribly 
   wrong (Ever know one to go right?) and even a Scotland Yard inspector 
   agrees. This seems to relieve the foursome, but when the reporter 
   also mentions that valuable beads of pearls were found at the scene, 
   Bill goes into panic mode, fearing they could be traced back to him. 
   They also find Joe's guitar at the scene and the reporter says the 
   crime scene is similar to the Sharon Tate murder, mentioning 
   &quot;hippies&quot; may be involved. When Bill turns up missing, 
   everyone goes into panic mode. They search the house for him and Joe 
   finds Bill dead in a closet, his skin all blue and with bloodshot 
   eyes, just as Jane saw him when he gave her the pearls. How could 
   Bill look like this when he was very much alive just a few minutes 
   ago? When Joe tells Fred and Jane what he has found they come running 
   upstairs and when Jane sees Bill's face, she screams. They decide to 
   hide Bill's body so they won't be blamed for his death, but all they 
   are doing is digging their own graves. You see, you can't cheat the 
   Devil out of something that was promised to him, namely Jane. Will 
   any of them survive? Should any of them survive? Apparently not, as 
   Fred cuts his own throat with a straight razor as he is shaving and 
   Joe sees Jane missing her face at the jawline and speeds off on a 
   motorcycle, crashing into a lake and drowning, Jane looking on with a 
   smile on her face. Jane is committed to an insane asylum, where she 
   witnesses the entire Black Mass massacre in a vision, as if Bill 
   never saved her (and repeating all the gory kills several times!). 
   When Jane opens her clenched hand, she is holding a single pearl. The 
   orderlies find Jane dead in her bed, the ceremonial dagger impaled in 
   her heart. We then see a still-alive Lady Alexander walking out of 
   the asylum, telling her chauffeur (the gas station attendant) to take 
   her to the villa. The asylum doctor gives the police inspector his 
   theory of Jane's death, which must be heard to be believed (and you 
   still may not believe it!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

   tone, relying instead on pat supernatural trappings and 
   clich&eacute;s. The fact is that the cast of young adults barely pass 
   muster and they act so stupidly, it's hard to root for them. We want 
   to see them die because they are cruel, mean-spirited people who 
   don't deserve to live. Camille Keaton, in her first starring role 
   (she had a few bit parts in other Italian genre films before starring 
   in the rarely-seen <B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#MadeleineNitemare74">MADELEINE,

    SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE</A></B> - 1978) is not good at all here, 
   basically sleep-walking through her role as Jane. Truth is, I always 
   found her acting to be rather vanilla. She does quickly flash us the 
   &quot;full monty&quot; here during her bathtub scene. Some may find 
   that enough, but not me. Toss in scenes that make no sense at all and 
   what you have is a stew of supernatural hodge-podge, only broken up 
   by the graphically gory Black Mass massacre (Effects supplied by

   - 1975). If the rest of the film contained that scene's sense of 
   lunacy and graphic gore, the film would be much better than it is 
   now, but it is still a creepy little film. I found myself liking the 
   film more on the second viewing, but I really don't know why. I just 
   can't put my finger on it. I'm not going to recommend this film, but 
   I'm not going to lambaste it either. It is what it is, a supernatural

    PARK OF TERROR</A><A NAME="TrailerParkOfTerror"></A> (2008) -</B> 
   When Norma (Nichole Hiltz, who bears a striking resemblance to Jaime 
   Pressly), the anti-heroine of this film, screams out &quot;Get me out 
   of this hellhole!&quot; after her new boyfriend is viciously murdered 
   by three filthy louts at the Tophet Meadows Trailer Park, you really 
   feel her pain. The fact that it happens in the first eight minutes of 
   the film makes you aware that the rest of the film has a lot to live 
   up to and I'm glad to report that this may just become a modern day 
   classic of the macabre. In the first eight minutes we get to know 
   Norma and her surroundings. She is a used and abused piece of trailer 
   trash who dreams of meeting the right guy and finally getting out of 
   the trailer park for good. A trailer park so dirty, colorless and 
   populated by society's rejects, it's actually a step down from living 
   in Hell. So when Norma's last chance at a normal life is murdered 
   (her new boyfriend is tossed into a wrought iron fence and is impaled 
   through his chest) by the trailer park's unholy trio of white trash, 
   Marv (Lew Temple), Roach (Myk Watford) and Stank (Ed Corbin), she 
   heads out on foot for the open highway and meets a mysterious man in 
   black cowboy duds (Country Music star Trace Adkins), who may be the<A HREF="trailer_park_of_terror_2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/trailer park of terror dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Devil himself (when we first see him, he is pissing acid in a field 
   and the bed of his red pickup truck is full of snakes). He uses her 
   fragile state of mind to his advantage and she makes a deal with him 
   to &quot;get even with the world&quot;. He hands Norma a shotgun and 
   she walks back to the trailer park, shoots everyone and then blows up 
   the trailer park (herself included) in a propane explosion. That all 
   happened in 1981 and ever since that fateful day, a rash of missing 
   persons have been reported in the area. In the present day, a busload 
   of juvenile delinquents on their way back from Jesus Camp (after 
   having their souls &quot;saved&quot;) are trapped in the area when 
   wise-ass teen Alex (Ryan Carnes) causes the bus to get into an 
   accident during a violent thunderstorm, forcing the teens and their 
   pastor chaperone to seek shelter in the Tophet Meadows Trailer Park, 
   which miraculously looks unchanged since it's 1981 pre-explosion. 
   They are all greeted by Norma, who regales them with tales from her 
   and the trailer park's past and then hits on the pastor. Goth chick 
   Bridget (Jeanette Brox), the only teen on the bus who thinks it's a 
   bad idea to spend the night at the trailer park, instantly recognizes 
   Norma for what she really is, since Bridget also use to be a whore 
   and shares more of Norma's traits than she cares to admit to. It 
   turns out that all of the former residents of the trailer park are 
   also back as undead flesh-hungry zombies and the teens and their 
   pastor will experience true terror and death before daylight arrives, 
   using their vices, hidden desires and weaknesses as a means for their 
   undoing. Only Bridget survives the night, but as she leaves Tophet 
   Meadows (which is now a burned-out shell), the mysterious man in 
   black appears, gives the camera a sly wink and then disappears.&nbsp; 
   Director Steven Goldmann, an award-winning Country Music video 
   director (which explains Trace Adkins involvement here [he also sings 
   the film's closing tune, &quot;Welcome To Hell&quot;]), has made a 
   winner here, thanks to a cast of trailer park residents who actually 
   look the part. While Timothy Dolan's screenplay (based on the 
   Imperium Comics series of the same name) offers us the standard teen 
   characters (pothead, sex addict, porn addict, smart aleck, etc.), 
   it's the residents of the trailer park that really sells the film. 
   They are the skuzziest and dankest characters in recent memory and 
   that's even before their zombie transformation. While the middle 
   section bogs down to introduce us to the teens and their 
   idiosyncrasies, the pace quickly picks up once they get to Tophet 
   Meadows and the gore literally explodes on the screen. Some of the 
   gore on view: Norma ripping off the pastor's head while they are 
   making love; a zombified Miss China (Michelle Lee), the park's 
   resident &quot;massage therapist&quot; (i.e. whore), walking on one 
   teen's upper torso until his spinal column bursts out his back (she 
   then rips off his dick when he can't give her a &quot;happy ending!); 
   a girl getting her arm cut off with a portable band saw while she is 
   tripping on drugs and then running into Larlene (Trish Rae Stahl), 
   the park's extremely overweight meat-hungry female, who rips open the 
   poor girl's stomach and begins chowing-down on her innards; and 
   Stank, who forces Alex and another teen girl to make a snuff film 
   (Alex is then skinned alive and deep-fried!). While the film does go 
   overboard at times, especially with Roach and the songs he composes 
   on his electric guitar (but, damn, the songs are funny!), the effects 
   are top-notch and the humor is extremely black. Why this film went 
   directly to video and bypassed a theatrical release is beyond me. 
   It's so much better than the <B><A HREF="saw_franchise_2004-2010.htm">SAW</A></B><A HREF="saw_franchise_2004-2010.htm"> franchise</A>

   torture Eddie every chance they get (At one point, Tim throws a naked 
   Eddie into the girls' gymnasium during volleyball practice and locks 
   the door behind him). Eddie also secretly pines for pretty fellow 
   classmate Leslie Graham (Lisa Orgolini), but she barely notices him. 
   Sammi is supposed to to give a Halloween concert at the high school, 
   but the local tight-asses and politically correct politicians ban him 
   from performing, calling his act &quot;rock pornography&quot;. When 
   Sammi dies in a hotel fire, Eddie becomes more withdrawn, tearing 
   down all the posters off his bedroom wall. Eddie's friend, radio DJ 
   Nuke (Gene Simmons), sees that Eddie is having a rough time dealing 
   with Sammi's death, so he gives him a one-of-a-kind acetate LP of 
   Sammi's last recording, made hours before his death. At a pool party, 
   Tim and his goons shove a bench weight down Eddie's pants and throw 
   him in the pool. Leslie has to jump in to save him from drowning and 
   as he leaves the party, he vows to Leslie that he is going to get 
   even with Tim and his friends. That opportunity comes later that 
   night when Eddie plays the acetate on his turntable and he hears a 
   message when he plays the album backwards. Eddie's luck seems to 
   change overnight. At school the next day, Eddie plays a prank on Tim 
   and gets away with it. This change in luck comes with a steep price, 
   though. The more Eddie plays the album, the darker the messages 
   become and Eddie slowly changes into a person ten times worse than 
   Tim. Wherever Eddie goes, bad things happen to those around him. As 
   more and more people end up hurt (Tim's girlfriend Geenie [Elise 
   Richards] is supernaturally undressed and has her brain fried when 
   she listens to a copy of the acetate that Eddie transferred to 
   cassette tape), Eddie begins to see the error of his ways. The 
   acetate is a vessel for Sammi's return from the dead and Eddie 
   finally realizes that his hero is nothing more than a murderous 
   supernatural psychopath. Eddie has to destroy the acetate and the 
   cassette copy he made in order to send Sammi back to Hell. That's not 
   going to be as easy as it sounds, especially since Eddie's best 
   friend Roger (Glen Morgan) told him he destroyed the tape, but really 
   didn't. Oh, and did I mention that Nuke has a copy of the acetate and 
   plans on playing it on his radio program on Halloween Night?&nbsp;

   Halloween party, which turns into a <B><A HREF="carrie_1976.htm">CARRIE</A></B>-inspired
    slaughter as Sammi begins zapping students with his guitar. This 
   film actually got a theatrical release, thanks to the then-fear by 
   idiotic parents and &quot;protectors of society&quot; that heavy 
   metal music was destroying our youth by forcing them to commit 
   suicide with hidden messages within the music. This film did not lay 
   those fears to rest. (When I was a kid, it was the whole Beatles' 
   &quot;Paul Is Dead&quot; debacle and he's still alive!), Director 
   Charles Martin Smith has a small role as Mr. Wimbly, the school's 
   principal, who gets zapped by Sammi at the Halloween party. Glen 
   Morgan, who plays Eddie's geeky friend Roger, would later go on to 
   become a successful writer/producer/director, working on the TV 
   series <B><A HREF="x_files_tv_1993_2002.htm">THE X-FILES</A></B>

   just may be that movie. The film opens with Henry (Tahmoh Penikett) 
   and wife Emma (Lesley Bibb; <B><A HREF="midnight_meat_train_2008.htm">THE
    MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN</A></B> - 2008) returning home from a party on 
   Halloween night. Henry wants to go inside, put on a porno tape and 
   have sex, but all Emma wants to do is remove all the Halloween 
   decorations from the front yard before her mother comes for a visit 
   the following morning (She says, &quot;I hate Halloween!&quot; as she 
   pulls sheets off the crucifix-like poles in the front yard.). While 
   Henry is in the house getting in the mood with the porn tape (just 
   like a man, he falls asleep), Emma is attacked and killed by someone 
   (or something) hiding in one of the sheets. When the porn tapes ends 
   and Henry wakes up, he goes outside to look for Emma, only to find 
   her tied to one of the crucifixes with an oversized pumpkin lollipop 
   shoved in her mouth. The opening credits rolls (a series of comic 
   book panels giving us a graphic representation of things to come) and 
   we are taken back to earlier in the night to the town of Warren 
   Valley, Ohio, where we watch young boy Peeping Tommy (Quinn Lord, 
   whose presence in this film holds huge ramifications for everyone 
   involved) spying on four girls, &quot;virgin&quot; Laurie (Anna 
   Paquin; <B><A HREF="true_blood_cable_series.htm">TRUE BLOOD</A></B>), 
   Janet (Moneca Delain), Maria (Rochelle Aytes) and Danielle (Lauren

    costumes and talking about coming to Warren Valley (a city which 
   takes the Halloween spirit very seriously) for the express purpose of 
   picking up guys (or, in Maria's case, a girl). We then switch to 
   overweight bully Charlie (Brett Kelly), who likes to smash the 
   neighbors' pumpkins and steal their candy. When he gets caught 
   stealing candy at Principal Steven Wilkins' house, Steven (Dylan 
   Baker; <B><A HREF="fido_2006.htm">FIDO</A></B> - 2006) makes Charlie 
   sit down on the front stairs while he carves a pumpkin and tells him 
   a story from his childhood, the moral of it being &quot;Always check 
   your candy.&quot; Charlie begins projectile vomiting (Steven spiked 
   his candy with poison) and Steven drags Charlie's near-lifeless body 
   into the house, almost getting caught by some young 
   trick-or-treaters. Steven then dumps Charlie's still-not-dead body in 
   a grave he dug in his backyard, but he is constantly interrupted by 
   his young son Billy (Connor Levins), cranky Halloween-hating neighbor 
   Mr. Kreeg (Brian Cox; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Red2008">RED</A></B> 
   - 2008; under heavy old-age makeup) and Kreeg's nosy dog Spite 
   (Steven cuts one of Charlie's fingers off with a shovel and feeds it 
   to the dog!). Steven finally finishes Charlie off and buries him 
   (this is apparently not the first time he has killed a child) and 
   then notices Mr. Kreeg screaming for help through his window, but he 
   ignores him and brings Billy down to the basement, where they make a 
   jack-o-lantern out of a decapitated woman's head! It gets stranger, 
   folks. We then follow four young trick-or-treaters, Chip (Alberto 
   Ghisi), Schrader (Jean-Luc Bilodeau), Macy (Britt McKillip) and Sara 
   (Isabelle Deluce), as they go on their rounds stealing pumpkins (for 
   a ceremony involving a school bus full of children who drowned in a 
   lake years earlier) and playing a practical joke on Rhonda The Retard 
   (Samm Todd), who is actually an idiot savant that likes to carve 
   pumpkins and has an encyclopedic knowledge about the origins of 
   Halloween. Meanwhile, someone dressed in an executioner's costume and 
   sporting vampire fangs is killing the residents of Warren Valley and 
   no one notices because this town's interest in Halloween goes way 
   beyond what we would call &quot;normal&quot;. It may seem that there 
   are too many stories here to maintain one's interest, but they all 
   manage to intersect in the most interesting and unusual ways, making 
   this film one of the most satisfying horror films to come down the 
   pike in quite a while.&nbsp; It's hard to believe that this film sat 
   on a shelf for two years before eventually being released on DVD, but 
   director/screenwriter Michael Dougherty (co-writer of <B><A HREF="#UrbandLegendsBloody">URBAN
    LEGENDS: BLOODY MARY</A></B> [2005]; this is his first feature film 
   as a director, but I see many more in his future) has nothing to be 
   ashamed of here. This was supposed to get a theatrical release (there 
   were books, comics, action figures and other merchandise commissioned 
   to coincide with its release), but the boneheads at Warner Bros. 
   chickened out, probably because this Vancouver, B.C.-lensed film 
   doesn't shy away from showing children being killed, mutilated or 
   constantly put in danger. That's a shame, because <B><A HREF="trick_r_treat_2007b.htm">TRICK

   is a modern day cult classic of the macabre. Not only are children 
   victims here, they are also villains (I won't spoil it for you by 
   giving away particulars, except to say that the final story, 
   involving Mr. Kreeg, is one of the scariest/funniest pieces of cinema 
   I have had the pleasure to watch). Dougherty imbibes all his stories 
   here with a palpable sense of dread, a heavy dose of atmosphere and a 
   wicked sense of humor. I'm not going to spoil the film more than I 
   already have but, needless to say, I haven't been this entertained by 
   a recent horror in many a moon. My highest recommendation. Produced

    TRIPPER</A><A NAME="Tripper2006"></A> (2006) -</B> If you hate 
   hippies, this is the film for you. In 1967, a young boy with a 
   terminally ill mother watches helplessly as his logger father is 
   arrested for pulling a pistol on a bunch of hippie tree-huggers who 
   are blocking the progress of a logging operation. The young boy then 
   grabs a chainsaw and attacks the leader of the protestors, nearly 
   cutting his head off (in graphic detail) before the police grab him 
   and cart him away. Forty years later, a bunch of modern-day young 
   adults, who adhere to the hippie lifestyle, are driving through the 
   same section of the forest when a dog darts out in front of their 
   van, nearly causing an accident. Ivan (Lucas &quot;Did you fly in 
   with those ears?&quot; Haas; <B><A HREF="witness_1985.htm">WITNESS</A></B>

   steps out of the van to take a leak and three guys in a pickup truck 
   bust a beer bottle over his head and speed off. After some homemade 
   stitches are applied to his scalp (in graphic detail) to close the 
   wound, the pseudo-hippies drive to the next gas station, where they 
   have a run-in with the same three rednecks in the pickup, led by Muff 
   (director David Arquette). After a small scuffle where troubled 
   hippie chick Samantha (Jaime King; <B><A HREF="bulletproof_monk_2003.htm">BULLETPROOF

    attendant Gus (Chris Nelson: <B><A HREF="#Rage2007">THE RAGE</A></B> 
   - 2007) steps in and breaks Muff's arm (in graphic detail). The 
   hippies continue on their way to the Free Love festival, a yearly 
   outdoor music and drug gathering of hippie types run by huckster 
   Frank Baker (a hilarious turn by Paul Ruebens). This year the 
   festival, which has had a troubled history (people end up missing 
   while attending it), is being held in the same patch of woods where 
   the boy killed the tree-hugger forty years earlier. After being 
   warned by Sheriff Buzz Hall (Thomas Jane; <B><A HREF="mist_2007.htm">THE
    MIST</A></B> - 2007) and a lumberjack named Dylan (Redmond Gleeson) 
   to mind their manners and to stay away from the local pot farmers' booby-trapped
    fields, the hippies camp out in the woods in preparation for the 
   festival. Not long afterward, someone in a Ronald Reagan mask begins 
   killing the festival's hippie guests in various bloody ways (in 
   graphic detail). Samantha believes that her abusive straight-laced 
   ex-boyfriend Jimmy (Balthazar Getty) has followed her to the festival 
   and wants to kill her and her friends for using drugs on a regular 
   basis. Could he be the hippie killer or is the problem more 
   localized? You have to watch the film to find out, but I believe most 
   readers of this site have a good idea who the killer is.&nbsp; Deftly 
   directed by twitchy actor David Arquette (<B><A HREF="scream_1997.htm">SCREAM</A></B> 
   - 1996; <B><A HREF="ravenous_1999.htm">RAVENOUS</A></B> - 1999) and 
   populated with plenty of recognizable actors (most of them appearing 
   as a favor to Arquette), including Jason Mewes (as a drug-taking 
   hippie, what else?), Rick Overton (as the town's crooked mayor) and 
   Arquette's wife Courtney Cox (in a funny cameo at the end), <B><A HREF="tripper_2006c.htm">THE
    TRIPPER</A></B> offers a nice mix of comedy and graphic horror. 
   Setting it among the modern-day retro hippie subculture was also a 
   nice touch (screenplay by Arquette and Joe Harris) that allows for a 
   few trip-out scenes, full-frontal nudity (of both sexes), drug use of 
   nearly every kind (including huffing glue and inhaling nitrous oxide 
   from a balloon) and plenty of tie-dyed outfits. The violence is 
   brutal, especially in the Unrated DVD edition, as the Ronald Reagan 
   killer lops off heads and hands, disembowels a man and pulls out his 
   intestines, catches people in bear traps and stabs them repeatedly. 
   Some of the comedy is inspired (Samantha's clean-cut ex-boyfriend 
   Jimmy's vanity plates reads REDST8S) and Paul Reubens is a hoot as 
   the foul-mouthed festival promoter, whose favorite word is 
   &quot;fuck&quot; (he also suffers the most bloody and funny death in 
   the finale, which sets up the film for a sequel). The biggest laugh I 
   had was when the Ronald Reagan killer murders Jimmy with an axe and 
   Jimmy's last words are, &quot;But I'm a Republican!&quot; You also 
   gotta love a killer that screams out &quot;Nancy!&quot; or quips 
   &quot;Well, there you go again!&quot; while killing the game cast 
   and, believe it or not, although the screenplay is politically 
   motivated, George W. Bush is treated rather fairly. Oh, sure, he 
   takes some hits, but he has his defenders also among the hippie 
   crowd. <B><A HREF="tripper_2006b.htm">THE TRIPPER</A></B> is a good old-fashioned
    slasher flick that is helped immensely by the unusual setting and a 
   biting political script (Why the killer adopts the Reagan personae is 
   especially original). This film is fun and I hope Arquette continues 
   to direct. I always thought there was something &quot;off&quot; about 
   the man (face it, he's always come off as slightly crazy, but not the 
   dangerous kind) and this film highlights that offness to perfect 
   effect. Also starring Richmond Arquette, Paz de la Huerta, Ben 
   Gardiner, Josh Hammond, Brad Hunt, Stephen Heath and Marsha Thompson.

   This is the first film from directing/writing duo Evan Makrogiannis 
   &amp; Brian Weaver (who would make the even-better <B><A HREF="super_2010_horror_film.htm">THE
    SUPER</A></B> in 2010 with many of this film's actors) and while 
   this shot-on-digital effort has its bumps in the road, such as muddy, 
   grainy photography, some questionable acting, bad sound recording and 
   some lousy makeup effects (not all of them, just a few), this is a 
   fairly absorbing look at a serial killer and what makes him tick. We 
   start with two girls alive in a Queens, New York,&nbsp; basement full 
   of slaughtered dead naked women, when Jon Beest (Bill McLaughlin) 
   comes down after being awakened by a foreign voice in his head (we 
   will hear that voice often) that says, &quot;Arise! It is time!&quot;.
    The two girls plead for their lives and when one of the girls says 
   she &quot;understands&quot; him, Jon thinks she means she can hear 
   the voice in his head, so he hammers two ten-penny nails in her head, 
   guts her until her innards falls out, puts her plastic bag-wrapped 
   body in his SUV and drives to New Jersey, where he dumps the body on 
   the side of the NJ Turnpike (hence the title of the film). Next we 
   see <A HREF="turnpike_killer_2009.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/turnpike killer 2009 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="214" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Jon
    meeting a jogging Michelle (Alia Lorea) at a park and she asks Jon 
   if she can use his cellphone to call her boyfriend, since she left 
   her's home to take a run. Jon obliges and then asks her out on a date 
   after she finishes talking to her boyfriend. Michelle tells him she 
   already has a boyfriend and Jon's attitude changes on a dime, so 
   Michelle becomes creeped out and runs away. Jon yells out, &quot;You 
   got a big surprise coming to you, you little cocktease!&quot;. That 
   night Michelle's boyfriend Nick (Frank DeJesus) gets threatening 
   phone calls on his cellphone saying such things as. &quot;Hey, 
   faggot, I'm gonna kill you and your slut girlfriend!&quot;. Michelle 
   explains what happened earlier with Jon, so Nick, after chastising 
   Michelle for using a stranger's phone to call him, takes Michelle out 
   for a night on the town. Jon breaks into Nick's apartment and waits 
   for them to come home. Once they do, Michelle takes a shower and Jon 
   beats Nick unconscious and ties him to a chair with duct tape (and 
   delivers one more sucker punch when Nick begins waking up). Jon drags 
   a screaming Michelle out of the shower and torments her in front of 
   Nick (&quot;Give me a blowjob&quot;, which she is willing to do, but 
   Jon pushes her away in disgust. &quot;Lick my shoes.&quot;, which she 
   does.). After playing with the nude Michelle for a few minutes and 
   telling Nick what a disgusting girlfriend he has, he cuts her throat 
   right in front of Nick and then proceeds to remove her internal 
   organs, slapping Nick in the face with what I believe is Michelle's 
   freshly removed liver. Jon has had his fun, so he stabs Nick in the 
   heart and then proceeds to cut Michelle's head off, dumping both 
   their bodies off the NJ Turnpike. Divorced NY Detective Lloyd (Edgar 
   Moye) and his partner are assigned to Nick &amp; Michelle's murder 
   case (they are working in conjunction with the NJ State Police), 
   while Jon patrols the Manhattan-bound PATH train for another female 
   victim. He finds one, chases her into an alley, attacks her (while 
   wearing a mask and a wig), throws her in his SUV, drives home to 
   Queens and then cuts off her head. Jon then meets wannabe Scream 
   Queen actress Maria (Theresa Planell), who is standing on the street 
   pissed that her boyfriend hasn't come to pick her up. She accepts a 
   ride from Jon (Uh, oh!), where Jon teaches Maria how to scream like a 
   real Scream Queen. When it becomes a little too real for Maria, she 
   opens the door (a severed female head rolls out) and escapes. Jon 
   hears the voice in his head again telling him to stop, so he hops 
   back in his SUV and heads home while Maria is talking to a crowd of 
   people nearby (&quot;A female head fell out of the car!&quot;). 
   Detective Lloyd, with the help of a NJ State Detective, figures out 
   that the NJ Turnpike's increasing victims are all from New York, but 
   the killer drives to New Jersey to dispose of them, the Turnpike 
   being his preferred dumping ground. The killer must be from New York. 
   Lloyd then beats the NY streets looking for info and gets some 
   important clues from street snitch T-Bone (Brian Manthorne). 
   Meanwhile, Jon picks up hooker Lolly Pop (Brenda Gonzales) on the 
   street. She starts making love to Jon in his SUV when the voice in 
   his head says, &quot;Kill her! Kill her! Punish!&quot;. Jon knocks 
   her out and brings her to a secluded spot in a park, but she escapes 
   and Jon hunts her down, eventually catching her under a tunnel, stabs 
   her in the mouth and kills her with repeated blows of a pipe wrench, 
   which he then throws into the river. A passing jogger sees Jon's face 
   and runs in the direction he just came from to get away. His face has 
   been seen too many times for him not to eventually get caught. 
   Jennifer tells Donnie that Jon is stalking her, so Donnie invites Jon 
   over for a talk. When Jon tells Donnie that Jennifer is his 
   &quot;sign&quot;, Donnie flips out and tells Jon to get out and never 
   come back again. Jon burns Donnie's face off on a hot stove and, as 
   Jon is leaving, he is spotted by Donnie's friend Jarvis (Chris 
   Vazquez), who discovers Donnie's body and calls the police (&quot;My 
   friend's face is missing!&quot;). Jon has left too many clues not to 
   be discovered and Detective Lloyd gets information on Jon and goes to 
   his home, trapping Jon in the basement while he is holding Jennifer 
   hostage. Jon hears the voice in his head again, lets Jennifer go, 
   charges Detective Lloyd and we hear gunshots as the screen goes 
   black. One month passes and Jennifer still has bad nightmares about 
   the ordeal. Her girlfriend answers the door and tells her a female 
   reporter wants to talk to her. The &quot;reporter&quot; knocks her 
   out and when Jennifer wakes up, she is tied naked to an altar while a 
   mysterious hood-wearing cult surrounds her. The head of the cult 
   turns out to be Jon's father (Demetri Kallas), who was also the voice 
   in Jon's head. Jon was a member of this cult since he was a boy and 
   learned to kill women at an early age. His father says, &quot;You are 
   the chosen! Hail Abraxis!&quot; as he mounts Jennifer in hopes of 
   creating a new Jon. The film freezes on the father's face and the end 
   credits roll.&nbsp; My only real complaint about this film is that 
   the sound seems to have been recorded directly from the digital 
   camera, so the farther the person is away from the camera, the harder 
   it is to hear what they have to say (you'll be turning the sound up 
   and down a few times while watching this). Bill McLaughlin is quite 
   good as Jon Beest (I hate that last name, though, but it is hardly 
   mentioned in the film) and Lyndsey Brown is also quite good as 
   Jennifer. The rest of the cast is so-so, especially Edgar Moye as 
   Detective Lloyd, who looks to be a good ten years younger than any 
   detective I have seen. Besides a few wonky special effects, most of 
   the guttings, beheading, etc. are very well done and quite 
   accomplished (and all were done practically; no CGI) for a film that 
   most probably had a budget that wouldn't feed a family of four for a 
   month. I'd keep on the lookout for both Evan Makrogiannis &amp; Brian 
   Weaver, because I see nothing but good things in their future (At the 
   time this review was posted, they were working on two new films). 
   Some of the locations in this film looked very familiar to me because 
   a lot of it was shot in Clifton, NJ, a mere three miles from where I 
   live. It was also shot on location in Queens, New York and various 
   other locations in NY &amp; NJ. This film was finished in 2009 and 
   had various boutique <A HREF="turnpike_killer_2009b.htm">VHS &amp; DVD</A> 
   releases until Wild Eye Releasing picked it it for a nationwide DVD 
   release in 2014. If you are slightly adventurous and like 
   ultra-low-budget gore films with an actual plot, you could do a lot 
   worse than this one. Also starring Niki Rubin, Manoush, Javier 
   Marquez, Lynn Hazelman and Christian McAteer. A <A HREF="http://www.wildeyereleasing.com">Wild

   teenagers' minds, which made us want to see them all the more. These 
   were the things nightmares were made of. Sure, we laugh at the 
   shoddiness of the productions today (although I do think the flying 
   bat-man still looks better than any film with a low-budget, even up 
   to this day of CGI, especially since this was done physically <A HREF="twilight_people_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/twilight people dvd8 front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="209" HEIGHT="291" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>[until
    the final shot]), but back in the early 1970's, these were films we 
   HAD to see, just to get those memory pieces out of our sleeping 
   brains. And we were entertained in the process. When I put this 
   fullscreen VCI DVD into my player, I was instantly transported back 
   to when I originally saw this film on a double feature with <B><A HREF="doberman_gang_1972.htm">THE
    DOBERMAN GANG</A></B> (1972). And that, my friends, is a good thing. 
   The film begins with scuba diver Matt Farrell (late Filipino stalwart 
   John Ashley; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Brides Of Blood">THE</A> <A HREF="horror j - q.htm#MadDrBloodIsland69">BLOOD</A> <A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BeastOfBlood1970">ISLAND</A></B>

    OF THE YELLOW NIGHT</A></B> [1970]) being abducted underwater and 
   being dragged up to the surface on a boat upside-down with a rope 
   around his ankles. He is then tied to a bed, when he meets 
   blonde-haired henchmen Steinman (Jan Merlin; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Silk2">SILK
    2</A></B> - 1989), who says he is being taken to the island compound 
   of Dr. Gordon (Charles Macauley; <B><A HREF="house_of_seven_corpses_1973.htm">THE
    HOUSE OF SEVEN CORPSES</A></B> - 1973) and Dr. Gordon's beautiful 
   daughter Neva (Pat Woodell; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BigDollHouse">THE
    BIG DOLL HOUSE</A></B> - 1971), also a doctor who makes sure that 
   Matt is in good health. After docking the boat and a long Jeep ride 
   through the thick jungle, Matt meets Dr. Gordon, who tells Matt that 
   he is doing experiments to create a race of &quot;super beings&quot; 
   since humankind will not be around much longer and we need to move 
   the evolutionary factor as fast as possible. Matt is a perfect 
   specimen for such an experiment. Matt is locked in a bedroom where he 
   meets the also-abducted Juan Pereira (Eddie Garcia; <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#BambooGodsIronMen">BAMBOO
    GODS AND IRON MEN</A></B> - 1974) while looking out of the terrace, 
   Juan (who has had his head shaved completely bald by Dr. Gordon's 
   assistants) tells Matt that escape is impossible and, if you look at 
   it the right way, this is not such a bad place to live (He will end 
   up eating those words in a little while). Meanwhile, we see Steinman 
   kill one of Dr. Gordon's escaped experiments, a half-man/half-boar, 
   much to Dr. Gordon's disgust. We get the feeling that Steinman is 
   running things around here, not Dr. Gordon. The good Doctor has a 
   whole menagerie af half-human/half-animal experiments in cages in a 
   laboratory in a cave. Some of them are docile, while others, like 
   Ayesa, The Panther Woman (Pam Grier; Eddie Romero's <B><A HREF="black_mama_white_mama_1973.htm">BLACK
    MAMA WHITE MAMA</A></B> - 1973; she does nothing in this film but 
   roar like a panther) are mostly animal and will kill at the slightest 
   provocation. Matt finds a way to pick the lock on his bedroom door 
   and takes a look around the compound, reading some of Dr. Gordon's 
   files, watching an experiment being performed on Juan where the top 
   of his head is cut off (some blood is spilled on Neva and she runs 
   away) and then saving Neva from being killed by an escaped Ayesa, 
   grabbing her from behind and putting her back in a cage. Most of Dr. 
   Gordon's experiments trust Neva, since she treats them with respect 
   and kindness. It's just that some have reverted back to their 
   animalistic ways and cannot be trusted. Neva, of course, falls in 
   love with Matt and they discuss a plan to escape the island with all 
   the experiments, in hopes they can be cured. Unfortunately, Steinman 
   knows all about Matt escaping from his bedroom and when he confronts 
   Neva about it, she makes a veiled remark that Steinman is gay and 
   wants Matt for himself, not as a lover, but as another head in a jar 
   (earlier in the film, when Matt is checking out the compound, he 
   finds a room full of decapitated heads in jars, along with other body 
   parts being kept in strange glass encasements). Steinman gets sexual 
   pleasure out of hunting humans. Matt wants Neva and the human/animals 
   to take a different route than him, because he earlier promised 
   Steinman that he was going to kill him and he's a man of his word. 
   Besides, Steinman would rather hunt Matt than anyone else. Steinman 
   orders a group of guards to retrieve or kill Neva and her friends, 
   while he take a small crew and hunts Matt (you now know why). Matt 
   has kidnapped Dr. Gordon and rakes him along on their jungle trek. 
   Neva is having problems controlling some of the experiments. Ayesha 
   kills a few guards by biting them in the face or tearing their 
   throats out. Primo, The Ape Man (Kim Ramos), tries to rape Neva, but 
   is stopped by the loyal Kuzma, The Antelope Man (an unrecognizable 
   Ken Metcalfe; Eddie Romero's <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Sudden Death">SUDDEN
    DEATH</A></B> - 1975) and Primo runs away. In the film's only 
   attempt at humor, Darmo, The Bat-Man (Tony Gonsalvez) tries to fly 
   off the branch of a tree, only to land flat on his face (He does 
   manage to inprove his technique though, otherwise my young teenage 
   years would have not been disturbed by those images). Something ugly 
   in the jungle foliage warns Matt that Steinmann and his crew are just 
   around the corner. Dr. Gordon escapes and heads back to his compound, 
   knowing all his work is about to be destroyed. Neva refuses to move 
   until Ayesa comes back, so she sends Kuzma to look for her. Kuzma is 
   shot by one of the guards and Ayesa tries to finish Kuzma off. Lupa, 
   The Wolf Woman (Mona Maria) intervenes, so Kuzma hits Ayesa several 
   times in the face with the butt of his rifle, killing her. After 
   killing Primo, some guards capture Neva, so the rest of the animal 
   people go on the offensive. Kuzma keeps the guards pinned down with a 
   rifle, while Lupa kills a guard and Darmo finds his wings (this 
   sequence can stand up to most big-budget movies today, only this 
   sequence is done practically), killing some guards in the jungle and 
   the compound. Steinman kills both Kuzma and Lupa, but Matt manages to 
   put a bullet into Steinman with his rifle before Steinman runs away 
   and hides for an ambush. When Matt goes to look for him following the 
   blood trail, he finds Steinman dead with his eyes open (it's quite an 
   effective scene), so Matt kept his word. Dr. Gordon is back at his 
   compound collecting his files and escaping through a secret 
   passageway, when he runs into a butt-ugly creature. It turns out to 
   be Neva's mother and Dr. Gordon's wife (the same creature who warned 
   Matt in the jungle), She stabs him to death with a knife and 
   disappears, not wanting her daughter to see her this way. When Matt 
   and Neva find Dr. Gordon's bloody corpse, they also see Darmo flying 
   off into the horizon (this time replaced by a crappy animated 
   bat-man). All's well that ends well.&nbsp; Thoroughly<A HREF="twilight_people_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/twilight people vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="164" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   enjoyable in its cheeziness, you have to give the movie props for 
   delivering some good human/animal makeups (not all of them are good, 
   though). Neva's mother is the stuff you find in your nightmares and 
   Eddie Romero was smart to limit her time on screen. It just makes it 
   all the more effective. There's also a fairly good amount of blood 
   for a PG-Rated film (but no nudity), which wasn't unusual in films of 
   the early 70's. The late Eddie Romero (he passed away in 2013) found 
   great success in the United States with his made-in-the-Philippines 
   films in the 1970's. Besides the movies already mentioned, he 
   directed <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#WomanHunt1972">THE WOMAN HUNT</A></B> 
   (1972); <B><A HREF="beyond_atlantis_1973.htm">BEYOND ATLANTIS</A></B> 
   (1973); and <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Savage Sisters">SAVAGE SISTERS</A></B> 
   (1974). When his type of films failed to attract audiences in the end 
   of the 1970's, he continued directing films for his home country. 
   I've always enjoyed his films and he is but one of my favorite 
   Filipino directors (Cirio H. Santiago is still my favorite). A lot of 
   people don't enjoy Filipino films, but I have been a fan since I saw Romero/Gerry
    DeLeon's <B><A HREF="brides_of_blood.htm">BRIDES OF BLOOD</A></B> 
   back in 1968. The wonderful beauty of the people and the land, the 
   great acting ability of some of the actors, both native and 
   expatriate (John Ashley could never be mistaken for a good actor, but 
   he had &quot;something&quot; people liked and he loved the 
   Philippines, but he had to leave in the late 1970's and became a 
   successful producer of U.S. TV series before passing away much too 
   young at age 62 of a heart attack in 1997), and some of them are 
   still friends of mine on Facebook. I just wish kids today could 
   experience what it was like going to theaters to watch double 
   features in the 1970's. I guess &quot;experience&quot; is the best 
   word to describe it. I made many friends over the years as a teen 
   seeing double bills in the 70's, some of them still good friends of 
   mine today, but the teens today don't seem interested in having real 
   friends, but ones they can put on their social media sites (but 
   that's another story for another time). The IMDb lists Roger Corman 
   as an uncredited Executive Producer, a claim I find dubious, since 
   this film was distributed theatrically by Dimension Films, a direct 
   competitor with Corman's New World Films. I doubt Corman had anything 
   to do with this, even though he was working in the Philippines at the 
   time (but mainly with Cirio H. Santiago). Originally released on VHS

   remake of Hershell Gordon Lewis' early gore film <B><A HREF="2000_maniacs_1964.htm">TWO
    THOUSAND MANIACS</A></B> (1964) delivers on the gore but does not

   retelling of the musical film <B><A HREF="brigadoon_1954.htm">BRIGADOON</A></B> 
   - 1954). In fact, the plot is a step down from the original. For the 
   uninitiated, the plot tells the story of a group of Northern tourists 
   (the remake makes it a bunch of Nothern college kids on their way to 
   Daytona Beach for Spring Break) who are tricked into visiting the 
   Southern town of Pleasant Valley, which is really a ghost town that 
   comes back to life one day every year to get revenge on the 
   decendants of Yankees who slaughtered them during the Civil War more 
   than 150 years ago. <A HREF="2001_maniacs_2004.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/2001 maniacs dvd front small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="136" HEIGHT="194" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>That's
    basically the plot in a nutshell. The new version finds the town's 
   mayor (Robert Englund) and matriarch (Lin Shaye) holding a jubilee in 
   the new visitors' honor, the visitors not realizing that they are the 
   main course. Most of them die horrible, gory deaths. One girl is 
   drawn and quartered, her flesh then cooked and eaten by her 
   unsuspecting friends during lunch. One guy is made to drink acid 
   through a tube while having sex with a local, his torso opening up as 
   his guts spill out while the acid burns a hole through the bed. 
   Another girl has a giant iron bell dropped on her, crushing her body 
   to a bloody pulp. Another guy is crushed under a giant press so hard 
   that his eyes fly out of their sockets. The only gay guy in the group 
   has a giant skewer shoved so far up his ass that the end comes out of 
   his mouth. A local girl bites the dick off another guy after putting 
   pointy metal teeth in her mouth. The last two surviving kids must try 
   to escape the murderous cannibal Southeners before they, too, end up 
   as meals on the picnic tables. In an ironic ending (different from 
   the original because audiences today probably won't 
   &quot;understand&quot; a happy ending), the kids get away on a 
   motorcycle but meet one final booby trap as they escape.&nbsp; 
   Director Tim Sullivan (<B><A HREF="driftwood_2006.htm">DRIFTWOOD</A></B> 
   - 2006) ups the gore quotient from the original (and really pushes 
   the film's R-rating), but fails when it comes to building any tension 
   between and during the murders. There's some inventive touches here 
   and there (such as the scene of the group playing a twisted game of 
   horseshoes), but they eventually lead nowhere. It seems that they 
   were put there just to chew up time. Speaking of chewing, Robert 
   Englund eats up the scenery with his role (as does Lin Shaye), but 
   the the kids are bland and unbelievable in their roles as the horny 
   college students who are more interested in getting laid than to 
   notice what the hell is going on around them. I also didn't like all 
   the heavy metal music on the soundtrack (another trend in recent 
   horror films). It seems out-of-place considering the circumstances 
   and ill-conceived. The use of an updated version of H.G. Lewis' song 
   (&quot;The South's Gonna Rise Again&quot;) from the original film is 
   also a dud. All-in-all, I like the original film much, much better 
   than this remake, even if this one had better lead actors, bloodier 
   effects (although this one didn't contain the notorious barrel-roll 
   scene of the original) and a bigger budget. The original had an air 
   of desperation and dread (probably because they were working with 
   relatively no money and had to improvise) that this remake is so 
   sorely missing. If you are purely into gore, <B><A HREF="2001_maniacs_2004b.htm">2001

   the cell next to them is Ben (Brian Posehn; <B><A HREF="devils_rejects_2005.htm">THE
    DEVIL'S REJECTS</A></B> - 2005), a victim of the White Man's Curse 
   who has just eaten the brains of his wife and young daughter and is 
   sentenced to hang the following morning. Elmer and Luke form an 
   uneasy alliance and break out of jail, sticking filthy slob Deputy 
   Cletus (Chris Coppola) in the cell next to Ben, where Ben bites him 
   and Cletus eventually bites the Sheriff. After taking back the money 
   Sheriff Claypool stole from Elmer (and then robbing the Sheriff's 
   safe for good measure), the duo hightail it out of town (their gun 
   skills are so bad, neither of them can hit the side of a barn) and 
   are followed by mystery woman Sue (Navi Rawat; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Feast 2006">FEAST</A></B> 
   - 2005). After hanging Ben in the morning (more on that later), 
   Sheriff Claypool and Deputy Cletus (who are now both infected with 
   the White Man's Curse) lead a posse to capture Elmer and Luke, but 
   first they put the bite on their posse and pass the curse on to them. 
   Sue turns out to be Geronimo's niece and takes Luke and Elmer 
   prisoner (she strips them naked and forces them to ride bareback 
   until their balls are raw!), but she eventually joins forces with 
   them to get even with the men who killed her uncle. While Sheriff 
   Claypool and his zombified posse hunt down our trio (where our trio 
   quickly learns that the posse can't be killed with bullets or arrows, 
   not even to their heads), Ben springs back to undead life after his 
   hanging and begins putting the bite on the townspeople, beginning 
   with Kate and trapping the town's Padre (the diminutive Leslie 
   Jordan) in the hotel (he gets so thirsty, he drinks from a 
   spittoon!). When the trio is captured by the U.S. Army (Elmer is an 
   Army deserter), the same people responsible for Geronimo's death, the 
   trio discover that the White Man's Curse is spreading rapidly and the 
   only way to stop it is to dig up Geronimo's body and perform a ritual 
   using his flesh, which may be the only way to save Elmer and Luke, 
   who are now infected.&nbsp; This zombie comedy (or &quot;Zombedy&quot;
    as the film's secondary title suggests), directed and written by 
   Glasgow Phillips (his feature film debut), has a few funny and gory 
   scenes, but truth be told, the humor is a little too 
   &quot;modern&quot; for a Western setting, especially Navi Rawat's 
   Sue, a New York educated Indian who is too wise for her years, not to 
   mention more liberated than any woman would be even 100 years later 
   (Truth be told, I'm majorly in love with Navi Rawat and have been 
   even since I first laid eyes on her on the TV series <B><A HREF="numb3rs_tv_series_2005-2010.htm">NUMB3RS</A></B> 
   [2005 - 2010]). The film's good points are that the zombies retain 
   their human traits (such as speech and the ability to think) and that 
   simply shooting them in the head doesn't kill them; they must be 
   decapitated to die, which sets up some nifty makeup effects (supplied 
   by maestro Robert Kurtzman), There's also some dodgy CGI on view, 
   especially some obvious computer generated explosions and arterial 
   spray, an all-too-common occurrence in DTV films today. I do have to 
   say, though, that the cure Luke and Elmer find for their affliction 
   is novel (if you can't find Geronimo, eating one of his relatives 
   will do the trick) and Ben reuniting with his family in the finale 
   were nice touches. Not a total success, but not a failure, either, <B><A HREF="undead_or_alive_2007b.htm">UNDEAD

   as a dupe VHS (the quality is good, though, in what looks like a

   the local mortician and undertaker who kills women to have sex with. 
   His nephew Nicholas (Patrick Askin),who is studying necrophilia in 
   his college anthropology class, catches on to his Uncle's lurid 
   doings and gets his anthropology teacher (Rebecca Yaron) involved in 
   the mess. The whole film is a series of Spinell hunting down women 
   and <A HREF="undertaker_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/undertaker 1988 vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="110" HEIGHT="175" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>killing
    them so they can be sent to his funeral home where he can have his 
   way with their bodies.&nbsp; Bodies are slit open with straight 
   razors, machetes, hypodermic needles and any other sharp object that 
   is available. Uncle Roscoe catches Nicholas snooping in his things 
   and knocks him out and ties him up next to a bloody dead woman. A 
   local movie theater security guard (played by Associate Producer 
   France Poeta) notices that all the murders resemble the movie that is 
   now playing and deduces that one of the patrons is doing the 
   killings. The police are also involved trying to solve the gory 
   murders. Considering that this is Spinell's final film (and resembles 
   William Lustig's <B><A HREF="maniac_1980.htm">MANIAC</A></B> [1980] 
   to a certain degree), director Franco De Steffanino fills the films 
   with amateur actors, downright silly situations and a screenplay (by 
   William James Kennedy, who some people think is the actual director 
   and that De Steffanino is just a pseudonym he used, but they would be 
   wrong, as it is a pseudonym for producers Frank Avianca and Steve 
   Bono, screenwriter Kennedy and cinematographer Richard E. Brooks, who 
   all had a hand in directing the film) that pushes believability 
   beyond the realm of, well, believability. The main reason for 
   watching this is Joe Spinell's sweaty performance as Roscoe. He is a 
   creepy, ugly man who is incapable of having sex with a living woman. 
   The coroner even tells the police that he found traces of semen on 
   one of the disemboweled woman's intestines! The cop then says: &quot;I
    think I'm going to be sick!&quot; Roscoe hates all living people 
   calling them hypocrites, bastards, jerks and so forth, while putting 
   on a front when faced with the grieving relatives. When the security 
   guard gets too close to the truth, Roscoe plants a knife in his eye. 
   It's up to Nicholas' teacher to solve the murders and she enlists 
   some college friends and the cops to stop the killings. Roscoe kills 
   both cops (one of them played by Kennedy), putting an ice pick 
   through one's neck and slitting the other's throat, all the while 
   crying and blaming the crimes on Nicholas, whom he says was abused as 
   a child (By him!). He then goes after the teacher in a final showdown 
   and a surprise ending. This film definitely deserves the deluxe 
   treatment just for the simple fact that it is Spinell's final acting 
   gig and there's plenty of blood and guts to satisfy the most 
   discerning gorehound. Shot on a low budget and it shows, but it is 
   entertaining in a weird way. I recommend it but with serious 
   reservations for anyone looking for a coherent plot. Also starring

   mess (The on-screen title is &quot;The Death Merchant&quot;), as it

    middle. Richard Hatch portrays Dr. Peter Jensen, a college professor 
   who leads an archeology expedition to an ancient Indian burial ground 
   deep in the California woods. The professor is tired of working for 
   peanuts and decides to raid the tomb of all it's valuable artifacts, 
   which doesn't sit too well with student (and former lover) Kate 
   (Cindi Braun) and female Indian guide Dana (Cindy Pena). To make sure 
   the women don't cause any trouble, Dr. Jensen brings hired muscle 
   Williams (Jere Jon) and Mike (Frank Ruotolo) along to watch his back. 
   What the good doctor doesn't count on is releasing an invisible 
   Indian demon when they open the tomb. The creature (shielded in an 
   invisibility cloak ala <B><A HREF="predator_1987.htm">PREDATOR</A></B> 
   - 1987) first kills Dana, leaving the rest of our unhappy campers 
   without a guide to find their way home. They manage to make their way 
   back to their van, but the creature disables it as well as giving 
   Williams a nasty leg wound. Meanwhile, pissed-off park ranger Chuck 
   (Tim Thomerson), who Williams knocked out and handcuffed back at his 
   outpost, comes to and goes looking for the group. He finds them and 
   takes control of the situation, but is almost immediately decapitated 
   by the creature. Williams takes the booty and steals the repaired 
   van, leaving Jensen, Kate and Mike to fend for themselves. The rest 
   of the film is just a cat-and-mouse chase between the creature and 
   the remainder of the cast. You dont need ESP to know who is going to 
   live and who is going to bite it.&nbsp; This is standard 
   monster-on-the-loose stuff elevated every once in a while by some 
   extreme gore. I will admit it was nice to see Richard Hatch (also in 
   Woelfel's <B><A HREF="iron_thunder_1998.htm">IRON THUNDER</A></B> - 
   1998) play a bad guy for a change, but the generic script Scott 
   Spears (who was also cinematographer and second unit director) 
   doesn't give Hatch or anyone else in the cast very much to do except 
   run around and be fodder for the creature. The creature is a dodgy 
   CGI creation (as is Thomerson's decapitation) that never looks the 
   least bit frightening, so I guess it's best that it's kept invisible 
   for most of the running time. When will filmmakers learn that CGI is 
   no substitute for good old physical effects? The film does throw in 
   an unusual surprise ending, but it's just a matter of too little too 
   late. This is the kind of film that Roger Corman or Fred Olen Ray 
   churned out on a regular basis during the 80's &amp; 90's. If you 
   liked those, you'll probably like this one, too. I do look forward to 
   Jay Woelfel's latest film (as of this writing) <B><A HREF="live_evil_2007.htm">LIVE
    EVIL</A></B> (2007), his take on the vampire legend which he also

    Forbes to believe her, she joins forces with Greg (who witnesses the 
   creature killing one of his rubes [played by Filipino staple Ken 
   Metcalfe]) and ocean biologist Dr. Whiting (Charles Howerton) to find 
   a way to stop the monster from killing more innocent people. Mr. 
   Forbes tries his damnedest to keep word of the deaths from reaching 
   the ears of his customers or the press, but that becomes next to 
   impossible when human body parts begin washing ashore. When the 
   creature attacks and kills several more of the resort's tourists, Mr. 
   Forbes offers $1000 and a week's stay in the Presidential Suite to 
   any tourist who bags the creature. Of course, all the tourists 
   automatically disregard the bloody attack the night before and 
   greedily take to the ocean en masse to kill the monster. When the 
   tourists (Many of them too drunk or too stupid beyond believability) 
   prove not up to the task, Greg uses the now-dead Dr. Whiting's body 
   as chum (!) to entice the monster before blowing it up with 
   explosives. Too bad that the viewer couldn't get as swift a death as 
   the creature, because we'll have to keep the images of this film in 
   our brains for the rest of our lives.&nbsp; This horror film, 
   directed by Charles B. Griffith (screenwriter of the cult classic <B><A HREF="little_shop_of_horrors_1960.htm">LITTLE

   new plateau of awfulness. It's a movie that is so shitty, I felt I 
   had to wipe my ass after watching it. Nearly every technical credit 
   is sub-par, including editing that looks to have been performed by 
   someone going through detox, post-synch dubbing that sounds like it 
   was recorded in a closet, and a monster that looks so ridiculous, I 
   can't imagine how anyone in the cast kept a straight face when 
   looking at it (imagine a shark with a couple of extra dorsal fins 
   glued-on to it's body, done with the technical ability of an Ed Wood 
   flick). Maybe it's because the cast realized when they got on set 
   what a crap sandwich they signed themselves onto, as everyone looks 
   and acts like they just got back from a loved one's funeral. The 
   screenplay, by Alfred M. Sweeney (credited to Anne Dyer on posters 
   and ad mats), is just a jumbled mess of horror clich&eacute;s with no 
   connective tissue, as sequences jump from one scene to the next 
   without making any sense. People in this film do the most idiotic 
   things imaginable and I let out an audible groan when all the 
   tourists took to the ocean to kill the creature for a measly thousand 
   bucks and a free week's stay at the resort (even the tourists that 
   were injured the night before!). It's this type of contempt for the 
   audience that makes this film a contender for the worst <B><A HREF="jaws_1975.htm">JAWS</A></B> 
   rip-off of all time (and, yes, I'm taking <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Devil Fish">DEVIL

   but that doesn't explain the rash of weird deaths happening to the 
   jocks and their snotty cheerleader girlfriends, beginning with Roger 
   (Brandon Sacks), who is roasted alive in a tanning bed.&nbsp; When 
   head cheerleader Heather (Audra Lee Keener) wakes up one morning 
   covered in spiders (that crawl out of a huge zit on her face!), she 
   rips her face off after crashing into a mirror. Head jock Buck 
   (Michael Coe) believes that Samantha and David are responsible, but 
   when fellow jock Tom (Nate Herd) has his penis fried off after 
   pissing on an electric fence (his ring finger is also removed), 
   Samantha believes this is all tied to Mary Banner's disappearance in 
   1969. Samantha and David begin looking-up people who were around 
   during Mary's disappearance in 1969, beginning with black 60's 
   radical pothead Grace Taylor (Tina Lifford; <B><A HREF="blood_work_2002.htm">BLOOD
    WORK</A></B> - 2002), who tells Samantha and David that Mary has 
   returned and is taking revenge on the offspring of the five people 
   responsible for her death. With three of the children already dead, 
   Samantha and David try to find the remaining two families, not aware 
   that one of the families is closer than they think (Hint: What name 
   could Willy be using today?).&nbsp; This is the third film in the <B><A HREF="urban_legend_series.htm">URBAN

   BLOODY MARY</B> suffers from a weak script (screenplay by Michael 
   Dougherty and Dan Harris) that never rises above the ordinary or 
   offers any real scares. There are some gory deaths (Heather's 
   spider-filled demise is the film's highlight) and shock cuts 
   (especially when Bloody Mary enters the frame), but the entire story 
   hinges on figuring out who the fifth family is and even a monkey who 
   has its body and brains inflicted with syphilis in some laboratory 
   experiment could figure it out in the film's first fifteen minutes. 
   Don't get me wrong, this is an OK horror flick for those not too 
   concerned about having a substantial plot, but I, for one, would have 
   liked the mystery elements to be, well, more mysterious. Typical 
   big-budget studio DTV stuff. Watchable, yet hardly remarkable. Also

   While I would normally leave a film like this for my friend Mario to 
   review on his <A HREF="films_on_the_fringe.htm">FILMS ON THE FRINGE</A> 
   section of this web site, I had to comment on this unholy crapfest 
   disguised as a horror film. First, it was directed by former fanboy 
   Donald Farmer of <B><A HREF="films_on_the_fringe.htm#Demon Queen">DEMON

    many consider the first gore film. While he was wooden in that 
   particular film, he looks absolutely professional as Lt. Ryan (who 
   gets chainsawed to death for refusing to co-operate with gangsters) 
   compared to all the other actors in this film. A vampire cop named 
   Lucas (Ed Cannon, who is always shown in the same fog-shrouded shot 
   as he is about to attack the bad guys) tries to stop a prostitute and 
   drug ring after his partner is killed. Nosey TV reporter Melanie 
   Roberts (Melissa Moore) keeps bugging Lucas for leads to the story 
   and soon they fall in love. Finding out he is a vampire doesn't 
   bother her much. Actually it turns her on more as she takes off her 
   clothes at the drop of a hat (the only worthwhile reason for viewing 
   this abomination). In the finale,&nbsp; Melanie is taken hostage by 
   the head baddie as he forces Lucas to wait for the sun to rise, 
   therefore killing his nemesis and keeping his illegal business in 
   business. I'm trying to decide where to start to describe how bad 
   this film really is. Besides the atrocious acting, there's shots of 
   Lucas being shot point blank by shotguns and handguns and no bullet 
   holes appear in his shirt! The dimestore vampire teeth are a laugh 
   riot and when he bites down on a victim, he rises with no blood on 
   his mouth. Now that's what I call cleaning your plate! The camera 
   work is choppy and the music mainly generic, but the biggest 
   head-scratcher of all is how does a vampire become a cop? Don't you 
   have to go through trainng camp for several weeks? In the daylight? 
   While there is plenty of nudity on display (most of the supporting 
   women are butt-ugly) this film doesn't have much going for it except 
   the all-too-brief appearance of Arnold and the aforementioned nudity 
   of Moore (who is beautiful and has a long career in horror films). 
   For a vampire film, this one sucks. Keep on the lookout because 
   Donald Farmer is still making films today and it looks like he has 
   learned nothing from his previous mistakes. Also starring Terence 
   Jenkins, Michelle Berman and Morrow Faye. Tim Ritter (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Killing Spree">KILLING

   I think it was, but since I didn't laugh, I could very well be wrong. 
   Vic Diaz spends most of his screen time crying (he wants to be a 
   vampire but can't stand the taste of blood), farting (and inhaling 
   the vapors) or chasing our two heroes around a graveyard, while 
   Carradine quotes poetry and the hooker/vampires spout lines like, 
   &quot;It's not murder. It's dinner.&quot; Our two heroes don't fare 
   much better in the dialogue department as they have to speak such 
   cringe-inducing lines like, &quot;That cemetery is full of dead 
   bodies!&quot; (Well, let hope so!). This one-joke film is stretched 
   to an unbearable 80 minutes and, if it weren't for the frequent 
   female nudity on view, I would have turned it off after Diaz's first 
   gas attack. There's also some risable post-sync dubbing (it seems 
   about 50% of the film is dubbed) even though it's plain to see 
   everyone is speaking English. It also has a long orgy scene (where 
   the female vampires keep their panties on) intercut with Carradine 
   killing a rat with a crossbow and making Diaz drink it's blood. The 
   uncredited end title song has lyrics that go, &quot;They're vampire 
   hookers and blood is not all they suck.&quot; That's about as funny 
   as it gets here, folks. This is one of those films that everyone has 
   heard of but few have seen. There is a reason for that. It stinks.

   - 1978) arriving in Venice in a gondola (standing up, so pedestrians 
   will notice him!) in the late 19th Century, as he explains in 
   voiceover that he is an expert on Nosferatu, who is the Lord of Evil 
   (&quot;Second to the Devil himself&quot;). The Professor has traced 
   Nosferatu from the time he ruled the land in the 10th Century until 
   he disappeared in Venice in 1786, where the city of Venice was hit 
   with the Plague and over half of the population died from it.&nbsp; 
   An elderly Princess (Maria Cumani Quasimodo; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#AllColorsDark1972">ALL
    THE COLORS OF THE DARK</A></B> - 1972) has summoned the Professor to

    Nosferatu (Klaus Kinski; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#FootprintsMoon1974">FOOTPRINTS

   has changed over the years, but what hasn't changed are the people, 
   as they have the blood he needs to survive and thrive, letting him 
   create an army of vampires under his control. He starts by biting a 
   woman dancing at a gypsy camp (portrayed by professional dancer La 
   Chunga) and it escalates from that point on. But first, Nosferatu 
   explores his beloved changed city, finding much to enjoy (people in 
   masks celebrating in the streets) and much to make him sad (people 
   staring at him as if he were a freak). Nosferatu pays the Princess a 
   visit in her bedroom at night, who holds a crucifix to him to ward 
   him off, but he grabs the crucifix, destroys it and throws the 
   Princess out her bedroom window, where she is impaled on a iron fence 
   below. The Princess' beautiful young charge, Helietta Canins (Barbara 
   De Rossi), asks the Professor for help in killing Nosferatu, so the 
   first thing he does is break into that strange coffin. A vampire 
   woman sits up from it, but she disintegrates in front of everyone's 
   eyes (The Professor tells them that this woman must have suffered 
   from the Plague, as even vampires are not immune to it! Why? It is 
   never explained.). Nosferatu catches sight of Helietta at a fancy 
   dress ball and it's love at first sight, at least for him (Like in <B><A HREF="fearless_vampire_killers_1967.htm">THE
    FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS</A></B> [1967], Helietta sees that 
   Nosferatu doesn't cast a reflection in the ballroom's large mirror).

   love to her, putting her under his control. The Professor knows this

    This artsy-fartsy vampire flick has many problems, the main one 
   being that it's so artsy-fartsy, it's confusing. This is a case of 
   style over substance and unless you are David Lynch, that is never a 
   good thing. I thought it took place in the late 19th Century, 
   according to the manner of dress and the lack of modern conveniences, 
   but when Nosferatu stalks an kills a prostitute on the street, she is 
   wearing a white miniskirt and white thigh-high boots and is carrying 
   a gaudy silver lam&eacute; purse, causing mass confusion on what 
   timeline this film is actually following. Another major problem is 
   that this film makes no sense at all, as Nosferatu walks in the 
   daylight with no problem, tossing all vampire mythos aside without a 
   hint of explanation. But the biggest problem is what this film went 
   through just to get made and it shows on the screen. Klaus Kinski was 
   hired to reprise his role in Werner Herzog's <B><A HREF="nosferatu_the_vampyre_1979.htm">NOSFERATU

   (1979), but he showed up on set on the first day of shooting with 
   long hair, saying he had no interest in reprising that role, so 
   instead of telling him to get lost and recasting the role, major 
   rewrites to the script were<A HREF="vampire_in_venice_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/vampire in venice italy poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="207" HEIGHT="307" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   made. Kinski then threw one of his patented temper tantrums, saying 
   he would not come on set as long as director Mario Caiano (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightmareCastle1965">NIGHTMARE
    CASTLE</A></B> - 1965) was in charge, so Caiano agreed to leave the 
   film (still being paid his full hefty fee), the third director to do 
   so. The original director was Maurizio Lucidi (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#DesignatedVictim71">THE
    DESIGNATED VICTIM</A></B> - 1971; <B><A HREF="street_people_1976.htm">STREET
    PEOPLE</A></B> - 1976), who shot a few crowd scenes before he was 
   fired by producer/screenwriter Augusto Caminito, who then hired 
   Pasquale Squitieri (<B><A HREF="gang_war_in_naples_1972.htm">GANG WAR 
   IN NAPLES</A></B> - 1972), but Caminito fired him, too. After the 
   Caiano fiasco, Caminito decided to direct the film himself, something 
   he has never done before, so he asked his assistant, Luigi Cozzi (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Contamination1980">CONTAMINATION</A></B> 
   - 1980), for some uncredited help and this is what they came up with, 
   Caminito getting sole directorial credit under the pseudonym 
   &quot;Alan Cummings&quot; (Kinski is said to have directed some 
   scenes himself). The frenzied background shenanigans on the making of 
   this film shows up on screen, as it is a fractured mess, some scenes 
   beginning and ending with no connective tissue between what came 
   before it or after it. It is not just erratic, it is also a very long 
   89 minutes, seeming twice as long than it actually is. There's not 
   much bloodshed, just a poor optical shot of a huge hole in Kinski's 
   chest when he gets blasted with a shotgun, which then heals quickly 
   (and is badly rendered). Actresses Barbara De Rossi and Elvire Audray (<B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Scorpion2Tails1982">THE
    SCORPION WITH TWO TAILS</A></B> - 1982) filed formal complaints 
   against Kinski, accusing him of sexually assaulting them when filming 
   scenes with him, but nothing ever became of it. Just like always, 
   Kinski kept on treating actresses as his personal sex toys, believing 
   himself above the law (filmmakers treated him that way, too, enabling 
   his bad behavior). Personally, I would have fired Kinski's ass 
   because there were much better actors at the time that could have 
   played the role better. Kinski is simply awful here, speaking so low 
   you cannot make out a single word he is saying and sometimes speaking 
   in a language no one has ever heard before!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    HANGING WOMAN</A></B> - 1973), another person on the bus (who was 
   hired to be a maid in Bojoni), mentions that maybe the entire village 
   is at church, but Luis tells her that he has walked throughout the 
   entire village and didn't see one church. They all decide to sleep at 
   the village inn and worry about the lack of people tomorrow. While 
   Luis is hanging up his clothes in a closet, he notices a peephole 
   that looks directly into Alma's bedroom and he spies on Alma 
   disrobing (full-frontal nudity) before putting on a nightgown and 
   getting into bed. Ernesto falls asleep at the inn's bar, but is woken 
   up when the outside door opens by itself. He goes outside to 
   investigate, walking down the cobblestone streets, only to then 
   discover that the village's creepy residents have him surrounded. He 
   is thrown to the ground as the people seek their teeth into him. The 
   following morning, Alma is awakened by the inn's maid (Mar&iacute;a 
   Vidal) and finds the inn crowded with the village's citizens. Alma 
   and Luis meet Boris (Jos&eacute; Guardiola; Klimovsky's <B><A HREF="i_hate_my_body_1974.htm">I
    HATE MY BODY</A></B> - 1974), Tolnia's Mayor, who explains to the 
   duo that the village was empty last night because they were all at 
   the cemetery saying their goodbyes to one of the village's most 
   beloved men, who died suddenly. Yes, Tolnia is one strange town. When 
   the inn's cook (Sandalio Hern&aacute;ndez) asks Boris what these 
   tourists are going to eat, he says, &quot;The Countess will take care 
   of it.&quot; In the next scene, we see a Giant of a man (Fernando 
   Bilbao; who acts in films also using the pseudonym &quot;Fred 
   Harris&quot;; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Exterminators 3000">EXTERMINATORS
    OF THE YEAR 3000</A></B> - 1983) enter a blacksmith's shop and chops 
   off the blacksmith's (Alfonso de la Vega) lame leg with an axe. 
   Immediately afterward, we see our tourists eating and complimenting 
   on the inn's tasty meat, which is actually the blacksmith's lame leg! 
   Boris tells the tourists that no other town has meat this delicious 
   (I hear it tastes like chicken. I hear!). Marcus wonders where 
   Ernesto is since he is driving the bus and they have to leave soon to 
   start their new jobs in Bojoni. Ernesto suddenly appears at the door, 
   his skin and face a sickly pale, and he tells Marcus that he has 
   already taken care of the dead bus driver's body. Marcus is glad he 
   did, jokingly saying, &quot;Later on you can tell me how you arranged 
   it. For my part, you could have cooked and eaten the poor 
   bastard!&quot; (If he only knew. I'm not so sure that one measly lame 
   leg could satisfy the hunger of all the tourists!). When neither the 
   bus or Luis' car will start, Boris says it will take at least two or 
   three days for the parts to arrive to fix the vehicles. Marcus 
   mentions to Boris that they are all broke, but Boris says that they 
   should not worry because the Countess will take care of all of their 
   needs. They all meet the beautiful Countess (Helga Lin&eacute;; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LoreleysGrasp1973">THE
    LORELEY'S GRASP</A></B> - 1973), who not only assures them that they 
   can have anything they want while they stay in the village, she also 
   hands Marcus a check for a large sum of money, which she says they 
   can split evenly among each other when they leave (I'm not so sure 
   that check will ever be cashed). Since the Countess is a Shakespeare 
   fan, she asks that Cesar (David Aller), the last person on the bus 
   (who is supposed to be the major-domo in Bojoli), to stay with her 
   for a few hours so he can recite some of Shakespeare's sonnets to 
   her. Of course, they end up making love in her bedroom, but when 
   Cesar discovers that the Countess is the village's queen vampire, it 
   is already too late for him. She bites Cesar in the neck and then 
   throws his body over the outside terrace, right into the arms of some 
   thirsty villagers below, who feed on his body. Luis once again 
   watches Alma strip naked through the peephole and even slips a note 
   under her door telling her that she will be safe because he 
   &quot;looking out&quot; for her! (He's a pervert and a hero at the 
   same time). That same night, Ernesto tricks Marcus and God&oacute; to 
   check out the inside of the bus, where several vampires (including 
   Ernesto) put the bite on the pair. What the vampires don't count on 
   is Luis watching this happen, so he and Alma must figure out a way to 
   escape the village with Raquel and Violet. Violet is outside playing 
   a game of Hide and Seek with the young boy and when she goes to hide, 
   she witnesses the Giant cutting a knife grinder's (Rafael 
   Albaic&iacute;n) arm off (The Giant says to the Grinder: &quot;The 
   Countess says you can continue sharpening knives...with one 
   arm!&quot;). As a horrified Violet watches, the Giant carries the 
   dismembered arm away and we next see Luis and Alma enjoying a tasty 
   meat dish. That is, until Alma discovers a human finger in her meal 
   and she screams. Boris assures her that is was all a mistake; the 
   cook had a nasty accident while preparing their meal (He cuts off the 
   cook's finger in the kitchen just to give his story validity!). Luis 
   tells Alma in her bedroom that he has figured out a way to fix his 
   car and that she, Raquel and Violet should be ready that night to 
   escape the village, unaware that someone is using the peephole in 
   Luis' closet to eavesdrop on their conversation (Turn about is fair 
   play!). Violet is trapped in the cemetery by the young boy, as the 
   bloodthirsty villagers rapidly approach, while Raquel searches for 
   her in the many undergound tunnels under the inn, accidentally 
   discovering the Countess' crypt (she gets bitten by several vampires 
   while running back to her room). The little vampire boy accidentally 
   kills Violet, when he hold his hand over her face to stop her from 
   screaming, as they hide from the vampires in the cemetery (The<A HREF="vampires_night_orgy_1972_dr_jekyll_vs_the_werewolf_1971_dvd.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/vampires night orgy-dr. jekyll vs. the werewolf dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   little boy is actually distraught, tears streaming down his eyes, 
   because Violet was the only child he has played with for centuries). 
   As Luis and Alma hop into his car and try to escape, they are 
   besieged by hordes of villagers and vampire bats, but they manage to 
   escape the village, only to find the Countess hiding in the back 
   seat. Alma manages to stab her several times, but Luis tells her to 
   stop, because they will need her body as evidence when they explain 
   their story to the police in Bojoli. When the sun rises, the 
   Countess' body dissolves into a pile of maggots (Luis says that the 
   reasons the vampires were able to walk during the day in Tolmia was 
   because the village was surrounded on all sides by mountains and the 
   sun never shone there. I don't really buy that explanation, but just 
   go along with it!). The police chief in Bojoli says there never was a 
   village called Tolnia and to prove it, they all drive back to the 
   location, where the village has disappeared. The police chief chalks 
   it up to &quot;youthful indescretion&quot; (even if it is obvious 
   that both Luis and Alma haven't been &quot;youths&quot; for a couple 
   of decades!) and they all drive back to Bojoni, not noticing the 
   burned shell of the bus used to get to Tolnia is on the side of the 
   road. Since we are never given an explanation on why the village 
   appears and disappears (Is it like <B><A HREF="brigadoon_1954.htm">BRIGADOON</A></B> 
   or <B><A HREF="2000_maniacs_1964.htm">2000 MANIACS</A></B>?), we have 
   to let our imaginations take over. Director Leon Klimovsky was one of 
   the better Spanish genre filmmakers, helming the previously-mentioned <B><A HREF="dr_jekyll_and_the_wolfman_1971.htm">DR.

   (1978); and several others (He also directed many Spanish-made 
   Spaghetti Westerns in the 60's) before retiring from filmmaking in 
   1979 (he passed away in 1996). Klimovsky's horror and thriller films 
   were always steeped in atmosphere and filled with gory violence and 
   nudity, so you could alway count on being entertained when you saw 
   his name on the screen. Screenwriters Gabriel Burges (who co-wrote a 
   few of Klimovsky's films) and Antonio Fios (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Apartment13thFl72">CANNIBAL
    MAN</A></B> - 1972; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#It Happened Nightma">IT
    HAPPENED AT NIGHTMARE INN</A></B> - 1973) get to the good stuff as 
   quickly as possible, showing Alma fully naked and implying, as well 
   as showing, some disturbing scenes of violence (especially the 
   Giant's attacks). Klimovsky shows a sly sense of humor here during 
   the dinner scenes, never showing human flesh being cooked, but 
   cutting quickly from an arm or leg getting chopped off to immediately 
   showing the unaware tourists enjoying the mystery meat (I especially 
   liked the cook appearing with a bloody bandage on his hand, his 
   middle finger missing, right after Boris says he 
   &quot;accidentally&quot; cut it off). The widescreen print used by 
   Code Red is pretty worn for the first couple of minutes, but then 
   clears up, only showing emulsion scratches at reel changes. It's the 
   best this film has ever looked on U.S. home video, so you can throw 
   out all those PD VHS tapes and DVDs and watch the film as it was 
   meant to be seen, the same as it was shown in theaters. I like this 
   film a lot and like it even more now that it is in widescreen. Also

   (2012) -</B> A lot of critics liked this point-of-view &quot;Found 
   Footage&quot; anthology film, but while watching this SOV flick, I 
   started getting an extreme headache from all the shakey camera work. 
   And most of the stories aren't all that original, either. The 
   wraparound footage (titled &quot;Tape 56&quot;, directed by Adam 
   Wingard, who also has a role) is about a group of unlikeable guys 
   (who like to videotape themselves attacking innocent girls and 
   lifting up their shirts to record their breasts) who are hired by an 
   unknown third party to break into a house and steal a VHS tape. Once 
   they are in the house, they find an old guy sitting dead in a chair 
   while numerous TV screens are playing static. The entire arc of the 
   film is that one guy at a time watches a videotape in the room with 
   the dead guy and then mysteriously disappears. The first tape is 
   titled &quot;Amateur Night&quot; (directed by David Bruckner), about 
   a trio of horny guys who have a pair of spy eyeglasses with a video 
   camera hidden inside it. They go to a bar and <A HREF="vhs_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/vhs 2012 poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="167" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>pick
    up a couple of women, one of them a very creepy bug-eyed girl named 
   Lily (Hannah Fierman), who only says &quot;I like you.&quot; The trio 
   take the girls back to a motel room, only to discover that Lily is 
   some kind of monster (a gargoyle maybe?), who proceeds to kill the 
   trio gorily one-by-one (This episode was remade as a feature film 
   called <B><A HREF="siren_2016.htm">SiREN</A></B> - 2016, written by 
   Bruckner and directed by Gregg Bishop, that is thankfully not a found 
   footage film, but is bad nonetheless.). The second tape is entitled 
   &quot;Second Honeymoon&quot; (directed by Ti West) about a 
   vacationing couple in Arizona who are unknowingly visited by a female 
   stranger who videotapes them while they sleep. This is easily the 
   weakest entry of the anthology and has an ending that just leaves you 
   saying &quot;What the hell?&quot;. The third tape is titled 
   &quot;Tuesday the 17th&quot; (directed by Glenn McQuaid) and concerns 
   four twenty-somethings who go to the woods and encounter a killer who 
   only shows up as a glitch on video (a rather good effect). It is 
   nothing but a short stalk 'n' slash gore flick with no true surprises 
   (Besides &quot;The Glitch&quot;, played by Bryce Burke). The fourth 
   tape is titled &quot;The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She 
   Was Younger&quot; (directed by Joe Swanberg) about a couple separated 
   by long distance who regularly keep in touch by computer using Skype. 
   Emily (Helen Rogers) believes her apartment is haunted by a ghost 
   child and there are some true scares here with a wicked ending and 
   very little shakey camera work. This is the second best entry in the 
   anthology. The fifth and final tape is titled &quot;10/31/98&quot; 
   (directed by &quot;Radio Silence&quot;, who are actually Matt 
   Bettinelli-Olpin, Tyler Gillett, Justin Martinez and Chad Villella 
   and also star in this segment) and is easily the best tale in the 
   anthology. The story is about a group of guys going to a Halloween 
   party and end up at the wrong house. They discover a couple of men 
   exorcising a tied-up woman in the attic and release her. Then all 
   Hell begins to break loose (with lots of good special effects that 
   will have you jumping out of your seat a couple of times), as the 
   guys and the girl try to escape the house. It ends on a really 
   downbeat note, but it's worth the trip. I'm not the biggest fan of 
   found footage films (as readers of this site no doubtedly already 
   know), especially when I always ask myself why people would hold onto 
   a video camera while they are being chased or killed, but <B><A HREF="vhs_2012b.htm">V/H/S</A></B> 
   is not without at least some merit (some scenes are very bloody). At 
   least it keeps the tradition of VHS tapes alive (the whole reason why 
   I started Critical Condition in the early 80's) and the wraparound 
   footage is a pretty good excuse for showing these VHS shorts (even 
   though sitting in a room with a dead guy to watch them defies all 
   common sense). Two sequels, titled <B><A HREF="vhs2_2013.htm">V/H/S/2</A></B>

   (2014), have already been made and feature a new roster of directors 
   (only Adam Wingard returns) and reviews state that both are better 
   than the original. I will wait for their eventual quick DVD releases 
   before I view them (the original and the first sequel were released 
   to Video On Demand a couple of months before they made their one week 
   limited theatrical releases, something which is becoming more 
   commonplace for small independent films) because I can't stand 
   watching &quot;shakey-cam&quot; flicks on big theater screens (the 
   further back you sit in the theater, the better). Also starring

   streak in him as it is apparent that all he wants to show is women 
   getting raped, beaten to a pulp or killed in bloody ways. After a 
   confusing 20 minute setup, this film tells the story of four women 
   who go out on a trip in the desert. They are stalked and attacked by 
   two mental deficients who take pleasure in raping and torturing the 
   women. That's basically all there is to this film except for poor

   photography (the night scenes are impossible to see), crappy sound 
   (one scene, where the four girls are talking in a car, all you can 
   hear is a lawnmower in the background!), grade school acting (lots 
   and lots of SCREAMING! and crying) and dime store gore effects. I'm

   discriminating readers may disagree with me). <B>VICTIMS!</B>, on the 
   other hand, seems to revel in the mistreatment of women just for the 
   sake of showing it onscreen. Sure, the survivors do find justice with 
   a gun and Bowie knife in the finale (where they are not just blamed 
   for the deaths of the men, but also for the robbery of a gas 
   station!) but that doesn't justify everything that leads up to it. It 
   seems director Hathcock blames the women for their woes because of 
   the way they dress and act. One drunk character blames it all on 
   women's lib! Stay away from this film and save 76 minutes of your

   (she replies yes, but it's the way she does it that will have you in 
   stitches). In the middle of the proposal, the young couple hear 
   someone groaning, so they get out of the rowboat to investigate. They 
   meet a hunter (Tyler Mane; Michael Myers in Rob Zombie's <B><A HREF="halloween_2007.htm">HALLOWEEN</A></B> 
   - 2007), who is about to warn them about something when he loses his 
   head (literally!). Del then is impaled in the back of his head, 
   causing one of his eyes to pop out of its socket. Sue is next. Victor 
   Crowley cuts some of her fingers off (including her ring finger) and 
   then lays her on the ground and proceeds to chop off her arms and 
   legs (the flesh stretches like cheese on a pizza!), finishing her off 
   by removing her head with his trusty hatchet and holding it up in the air.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then hear a young girl (the daughter of actress Felissa Rose [<B><A HREF="sleepaway_camp_1983.htm">SLEEPAWAY
    CAMP</A></B> - 1983], who appears in this film), who gives us a 
   verbal history of Victor Crowley. We are then in the present day, as 
   Andrew Young (Shen) appears on &quot;The Sabrina Show&quot;, where 
   his ex-wife Sabrina (Krystal Joy Brown) accuses him of being the 
   &quot;Body Butcher&quot;. Andrew denies it and is there to hawk his 
   book, which is about the 10th anniversary of surviving Victor 
   Crowley's wrath. Since hardly anyone believes Crowley actually 
   exists, the majority of people think that Andrew is the killer. On 
   his book-signing tour with his agent Kathleen (a terrific comic 
   performance by Felissa Rose), people call him a &quot;murderer&quot;, 
   draw penises on his posters and one guy whips out his dick for Andrew 
   to sign (a scene cut from the streaming version, but kept in the disc 
   versions). Everyone believes his book is a work of fiction. At one 
   book signing, wannabe director Chloe (Katie Booth), her boyfriend 
   Alex (Chase Williamson; <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad_page2.htm#BeyondTheGates2015">BEYOND
    THE GATES</A></B> - 2015) and best friend Rose (Laura Ortiz) 
   introduce themselves to Andrew and Chloe tells him that she is 
   directing a low-budget horror film about Victor Crowley and they are 
   going to the Honey Island Swamp to film the trailer (as as way to get 
   financing for the movie). Kathleen then tells Andrew that a network 
   will pay him to go back to Honey Island Swamp to film a <B>48 HOURS</B>-type
    crime documentary based on his book. Andrew doesn't want to go, but 
   when he hears how much they are going to pay him, he jumps at the 
   chance (like any good agent, Kathleen lies to him about the amount). 
   Chloe, Adam and Rose are already at the swamp and they hire Dillon (a 
   funny Dave Sheridan; <B><A HREF="amigo_undead_2015.htm">AMIGO UNDEAD</A></B> 
   - 2015) as their guide. On the plane ride to Honey Island, Andrew 
   sees that Sabrina is along for the ride, as are network reporter 
   Casey (my girl Tiffany Shepis; <B><A HREF="frankenstein_syndrome_2010.htm">THE
    FRANKENSTEIN SYNDROME</A></B> - 2010), technician Austin (Brian 
   Quinn), Kathleen, and a few other people who work for the network.

   are then interrupted by a breaking news report detailing the rescue 
   effort at Honey Island Swamp, which is then interrupted by Marybeth 
   (Danielle Harris; who starred in the previous two films), who cocks a

    Played more as a broad comedy than the previous three entries, this 
   film is still bloody as hell, yet many of the deaths are played for 
   laughs (Kathleen's, for instance), softening the blow for people who 
   get queasy at seeing gory violence. Whether you like it or not 
   depends on your tolerance for comedy mixed with bloody gore. I 
   happened to like it and laughed out loud on a few occasions. 
   Director/screenwriter Adam Green dedicated this film to Wes Craven 
   and George A. Romero, two titans who left us in 2017. An extra on the 
   disc, titled &quot;Raising The Dead...Again&quot;, has Green 
   explaining why he dedicated&nbsp; this film to the two masters of 
   horror and it's touching. Green also tells us why it is so fun making 
   these films and how having friends working with you is important in 
   having a pleasant work environment (Apparently, Green was going 
   through a dark time in his life when he was convinced to direct 
   this). The film is only 83 minutes long, so it doesn't overstay its 
   welcome. Green throws in some props from the previous film, 
   especially the gas-powered belt sander, which doesn't even exist. If 
   you like gore-drenched films with a good dose of humor, you can not 
   do better than this. Also starring Tezz Yancey, Blake Woodruff, Whit 
   Spurgeon and Kali Cook. Look for Joe Lynch (director of <B><A HREF="#WrongTurn2">WRONG

   is that type of film. Henry Jordan (Michael St. Michaels: <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#GreasyStrangler2016">THE
    GREASY STRANGLER</A></B> - 2016) receives a delivery at his door one 
   morning. Inside the wooden crate is an old TV set packed in hay. This

   delivered to the &quot;Institute For The Studies Of The Occult&quot;),
    they find Henry dead in his living room, slaughtered with a bunch of 
   household items impaled in his body (and a party hat on his head).

    shuffle around the woods and eventually crawl out of the set and 
   begin killing the residents of Shady Lane. Also on the TV program is 
   a beautiful woman (Jennifer Miro) who pops out of the TV and strips 
   naked in front of Jeff, teases him sexually and then pops back into 
   the TV. Jeff then sees the woman get her throat slit by a figure who 
   calls himself The Garbage Man (Cliff Watts). He warns Jeff to bring 
   the TV to the basement and attach a mirror to the TV screen so more 
   zombies can't escape. In no time Zoe, Jeff and new girlfriend April 
   (Vickie Bastel) are fighting a horde of hungry zombies, assisted by 
   an occult institute employee, Joshua Daniels (Sam David McClelland). 
   Expect lots of flying body parts and a few surprises along the way, 
   like mirrors used as weapons (&quot;The dead can't stand to look at 
   themselves&quot;) and an unexpected chainsaw death.&nbsp; The only 
   level of professionalism the film displays are in the zombie makeups 
   and gore effects. Everything else is pretty substandard, from the 
   atrocious acting (by nearly everyone), the original rock music (which 
   wouldn't get air play on any radio station), the photography (very 
   static and flat) and the pretty poor attempts at humor (When Jeff 
   asks his sister what her major in college is going to be, she 
   replies, &quot;Aerobics!&quot;). I do give one-time 
   director/producer/scripter Robert Scott major points for bypassing 
   most of the character development and basically ladling on the gore 
   from the get-go. Plenty of blood is spilled as zombies snap necks, 
   eat dogs, chow down on human body parts as well as humans attacking 
   zombies by planting an iron in one zombie's head (he walks around 
   with it implanted in his skull for the rest of the film), shooting 
   them with arrows, cutting them apart with a chainsaw (when one gets 
   cut in half, live rats spill out as well as guts!) and decapitation 
   by machete. There's also some ridiculous new folklore about zombies 
   dying by normal means (i.e. guns, knives) if you can convince the 
   zombies that they are really alive (huh?) and that bells ring 
   whenever zombies are near (double huh?). While the story doesn't make 
   an ounce of sense (Why would zombies be afraid of their own 
   reflection to the point of dying? Why would a slow-moving zombie turn 
   into a sprinter with a chainsaw in it's hands?), the fact that most 
   of the major characters lose their lives due to their own stupidity 
   is a major plus in my book. Besides, the ending is a real howler, as 
   Zoe invites all the zombies into the house for dinner and drinks and 
   traps them in the basement, where they are forced to eat each other 
   (triple huh?). The final twist ending is a groaner. This is not for 
   everyone, especially if you like coherence with your gore. It is 
   mindless fun for those with short attention spans. A film that could 
   only have been made during the coked-out 80's. Also starring Thaddeus

   talk show host Deborah Ballin (Lee Grant) speaks out for a battered 
   woman's right to a fair trial, which disturbs her producer Gary 
   Baylor (an unusually restrained William Shatner) and really pisses 
   off studio janitor Colt Hawker (Michael Ironside), who rips the TV 
   cable out of the wall in the Green Room. That night, Deborah goes 
   home and is savagely slashed across her body by a waiting Colt (who 
   wears a tiny bell around his neck). She manages to get away (after 
   taking a nasty fall down a dumbwaiter) and is rushed to the hospital, 
   where she is admitted for her wounds. Colt, whose apartment walls are 
   filled with racist, hate-filled letters he has written to newspapers 
   and TV programs, stuffs a switchblade in his back pocket and a camera 
   on his belt and heads off to the hospital, where he intends to finish 
   Deborah off. Nurse Sheila (Linda Purl), who acts as an 
   &quot;unofficial watchdog&quot; for Deborah, keeping fans and 
   reporters away from her room, also unintentionally runs afoul of Colt 
   when he hears her badmouth him (this guy is way too sensitive!). 
   Thinking that he has entered Deborah's room (she was moved a short 
   time earlier), Colt cuts the hose of a respirator of an old woman. 
   Seeing that he has made a mistake, he still takes advantage by taking 
   photos of her taking her last<A HREF="visiting_hours_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/visiting hours vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="171" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   dying breaths. He then stabs the nurse who comes to check up on her. 
   Sheila finds the old lady and nurse's dead bodies and spots Colt 
   leaving the scene. The police are called and Sheila stupidly declines 
   police protection, leading to Colt following her home. Instead of 
   killing her, Colt goes to a diner, picks up a young girl, brings her 
   home and brutally rapes her while running his switchblade up and down 
   her body. After another failed attempt on Deborah's life, the police 
   beef up security at the hospital, making it very difficult for Colt 
   to get near her. He retaliates by going to Sheila's house and calls 
   Sheila at the hospital, taunting her. Thinking her young daughter and 
   babysitter are in trouble, she races home. Colt is waiting for her 
   and stabs her in the stomach. He then calls Deborah at the hospital 
   and makes her listen to Sheila's cries of pain (as he repeatedly 
   kicks her for maximum effect). Sheila survives and Colt devises a 
   painful plan (involving breaking a beer bottle with his arm) that 
   gets him admitted to the hospital so he can have a final stab at

   in many ways <B><A HREF="visiting_hours_1981b.htm">VISITING HOURS</A></B> 
   is a much better film. The script, by Brian Taggert, builds much more 
   tension by delving into the backgrounds of Deborah, Sheila and, 
   especially, Colt. These are characters we become invested in, which 
   make the scenes of Colt stalking both Deborah and Sheila all the more 
   disturbing. Colt's life is documented by a series of flashbacks, 
   where each flashback gives us another little piece of his disturbing 
   childhood. These flashbacks are usually triggered when he cares for 
   his invalid father and we learn that, as a kid, his father physically 
   (and, possibly, sexually) abused both him and his dead mother. It 
   seems the only reason he wants to kill Deborah is because of her 
   stance on violence and her championing a jailed battered wife who 
   killed her husband (flashbacks show that Colt's mother threw a 
   steaming pot of soup in his father's face, scarring him). Of course, 
   the only way Deborah is going to get out of her predicament is to 
   toss aside her anti-violence ways and get down and dirty. This film 
   is full of little nuggets, like Colt riding a mini street sweeper 
   while cleaning up Deborah's TV studio (the parallels are obvious), 
   talkative Vinnie (Harvey Atkin), a hospital patient who plays a minor 
   role in Deborah's survival and Colt's deathmask, made of photos he 
   has taken of all his dying victims. While hardly gory by anyone's 
   standards (a few bloody stabbings and slashings), the film has a mean 
   streak that is quite undeniable (the girl's rape, while not fully 
   shown, is still very hard to watch). Michael Ironside (still with 
   some hair on top of his head) is his usual excellent self, as is 
   Linda Purl. Lee Grant, on the other hand, overacts quite a bit and, 
   believe it or not, it takes a subdued William Shatner to reel her in.

   They meet the mysterious Mrs. Abercrombie (Edna MacAfee), who offers 
   them tea spiked with a mickey. The girl learns from a hunter (Harry 
   Bauer) that the spa was the site of a grisly cannabalistic murder in 
   the 1930's where a cook at the spa killed a girl, chopped her up, and 
   served her to all the guests. She begins to have doubts about her

   (1988), which was loosely based on the novel with the same name by 
   Dean R. Koontz. Sure, it starred Corey Haim and featured one of the 
   most ridiculous-looking creatures this side of a Larry Buchanan film, 
   but it had an infectious charm and winning performances by Michael 
   Ironside as a sadistic government agent and a Golden Retriever as the 
   super-intelligent canine Einstein. Part II may not be as enjoyable as 
   the original, but it does have it's moments. It's not a sequel in the 
   truest sense, but rather a &quot;reimagining&quot; of the first film. 
   When the government tries to shut down a top-secret experiment called 
   &quot;The Aesop Project&quot;, involving The Outsider (a genetically 
   created creature who exists solely to kill) and intelligent dog 
   Einstein (who the Outsider is programmed to track and kill), lead 
   scientist Dr. Steve Malceno (Jonathan Farwell) tips-off a bunch of 
   animal rights activists, who raid the lab while Dr. Malceno tries to 
   smuggle out the Outsider in the ensuing fracas. Things go horribly 
   wrong and both Einstein and the Outsider escape. Einstein hitches 
   himself to Paul Ferguson (Marc Singer; <B><A HREF="beastmaster_1982c.htm">THE
    BEASTMASTER</A></B> - 1982; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Dead Space">DEAD

   MPs transporting Ferguson are killed by the Outsider (The MP driving 
   the jeep sees Einstein in the middle of the road and says, &quot;Oh 
   boy, two points!&quot; as he steps on the gas and tries to run him 
   over [a tip of the hat to <B><A HREF="death_race_2000_1975.htm">DEATH 
   RACE 2000</A></B> - 1975]), Ferguson is blamed by the police for 
   their deaths. He goes on the lam with Einstein and tries to figure 
   out what the hell is going on. Einstein convinces Ferguson to call 
   his trainer, Barbara White (Tracy Scoggins; <B><A HREF="dan_turner_hollywood_detective_1990.htm">DAN
    TURNER: HOLLYWOOD DETECTIVE</A></B> - 1990, also with Singer), in a 
   scene that has to be seen to be believed. Ferguson, Barbara and 
   Einstein join forces while the Outsider goes on a killing spree, 
   savagely murdering Ferguson's ex-wife Sarah (Irene Miracle) and then 
   killing two horny teens in a motel room that was previously occupied 
   by Ferguson and Einstein. Of course, the cops blame Ferguson for the 
   murders, but he gets help from Einstein and Barbara to clear his name 
   (Einstein types &quot;paul nokilr&quot; on Barbara's computer to 
   convince her of Ferguson's innocence). Dr. Malceno recaptures the 
   Outsider and tries to reprogram it but, once again, things go 
   horribly wrong and the Outsider escapes. Dr. Malceno ends up severely 
   injured (one of his eyes is torn out of it's socket, the Outsider's 
   preferred method of killing), so it's up to Ferguson, Barbara and 
   Einstein to kill the Outsider and clear Ferguson's good name.&nbsp; A 
   lot of this film rides on making us believe that Einstein is an 
   intelligent dog and I'm glad to report that it succeeds (Einstein is 
   played by a very talented dog named &quot;Dakai&quot;). Director 
   Thierry Notz (<B><A HREF="#TerrorWithin">THE TERROR WITHIN</A></B> - 
   1988), working with a script by &quot;Henry Dominic&quot; (actually a 
   pseudonym used by co-scripters John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris), 
   infuses the film with many comical moments, many dealing with 
   Einstein's communication with Ferguson, including Einstein giving 
   Ferguson a phone book and then laying white objects at his feet, a 
   clue for Ferguson to start reading off last names that begin with 
   &quot;White&quot; in the phone book until they get to Barbara's name. 
   The sight of Einstein driving a car down the street and not 
   registering with the pedestrians is also sure to bring a smile to 
   your face. I also like the scene where Ferguson sends Barbara to a 
   gun store with a laundry list of automatic weapons. When she 
   questions if anyone would sell someone like her these guns, Ferguson 
   looks at her and flatly says, &quot;Why not? This is America.&quot; 
   Funny and true at the same time. While not as gory as the first film, <B><A HREF="watchers_2_1990b.htm">WATCHERS
    II</A></B> has it's fair share of violent scenes and deaths. It's a 
   little overlong, but this Roger Corman-produced horror film is never 
   boring and does generate a good deal of suspense. The Outsider is 
   still a pretty chintzy-looking creation, although this time it's at 
   least not covered in hair from top-to-bottom as in the first film 
   (although the creature would again sprout hair in <B><A HREF="#WatchersReborn">WATCHERS
    REBORN</A></B> [1998], the fourth and, so far, final film in the 
   series). Unlike most horror films from this period, the Outsider's 
   death in the finale is rather touching. Jeremy Stanford, who has a 
   small role here as a policeman, went on to direct the god-awful <B><A HREF="#Watchers3">WATCHERS

   it into a low-budget <B><A HREF="predator_1987.htm">PREDATOR</A></B> 
   (1987) retread. When a plane carrying the Outsider (the creature) and 
   Einstein (the super-intelligent dog) is shot down over the jungles of 
   Central America, the American government sends five military 
   prisoners, led by Ferguson (Wings Hauser, who plays the same ch<A HREF="watchers_3_1994.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/watchers 3 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="268" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>aracter
    originated by Marc Singer in Part II), to eradicate all evidence 
   from the plane off the face of the Earth in exchange for 
   unconditional pardons. As they search the jungle for the evidence 
   (the government conveniently forgot to tell Ferguson and his squad 
   about the Outsider or Einstein), the prisoners stumble upon a rebel 
   camp where everyone has been savagely slaughtered, either they are 
   missing their heads or their eyes have been ripped from their 
   sockets. Einstein finds a young mute boy in the jungle and becomes 
   his protector, as the Outsider begins murdering members of Ferguson's 
   squad one-by-one. It becomes clear after a short while that this 
   whole situation was no accident at all. It is actually a controlled 
   experiment being performed by the government to determine the 
   effectiveness of the Outsider as a perfect military killing machine. 
   Thankfully, Ferguson has knowledge of the project (again, watch Part 
   II) and he and the remainder of his squad join up with Einstein to 
   try and destroy the Outsider. They fail miserably and, in the finale, 
   Ferguson, Einstein and the boy (the only ones left alive) create a 
   fatal boobytrap to lure the Outsider to it's death by impalement and 
   immolation. We will have to wait four more years for the fourth (and, 
   so far, final) installment of the series, <B><A HREF="#WatchersReborn">WATCHERS
    REBORN</A></B> (1998).&nbsp; Besides a few gory kills, where the 
   Outsider (it still looks ridiculous) rips-off the heads or eyes of 
   it's victims, this film is a chore to sit through. It's rather 
   obvious that director Jeremy Stanford (<B><A HREF="stepmonster_1993.htm">STEPMONSTER</A></B> 
   - 1993) and screenwriter Michael Palmer (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Carnosaur 2">CARNOSAUR
    2</A></B> - 1994) watched <B>PREDATOR</B> one too many times before 
   making this, as the Outsider mimics the Predator's killing style, 
   right down to skinning it's victims and hanging their bodies 
   upside-down in trees. There is also a ton of macho theatrics (such as 
   the scene where Ferguson puts a bullet in fellow squad member Nat's 
   [Daryl Roach] brainpan rather than letting him die a slow, painful 
   death after the Outsider thrusts it's hand through his chest and out 
   his back), a near-rape and an insufferable amount of footage of 
   people walking through the jungle. This isn't my idea of a good 
   horror film and, unlike the first two films, Einstein doesn't come 
   across as an intelligent dog, but rather a well-trained canine who 
   can bark on demand (you can practically his trainer just off screen 
   making hand signals to get him to bark, as the dog continually looks 
   in one direction before performing a command). When he puts a stick 
   in his mouth and writes &quot;DANGER&quot; in the dirt to warn the 
   soldiers, it's obvious he's getting human help in moving the stick. 
   This film is nothing but a waste of 80 minutes that not even the 
   always-dependable Wings Hauser (<B><A HREF="nightmare_at_noon_1987.htm">NIGHTMARE

   commissioned this fourth and (so far) final installment in the 
   series. While basically nothing more than a reboot of the first two 
   films, at least it's head-and-shoulders above the abysmal third 
   entry. As in all the other films, this one opens with the hideous 
   creature called the Outsider and super-brainy dog Einstein escaping 
   from a top-secret government laboratory. The Outsider, who is a 
   non-stop killing machine, and Einstein are psychically linked and the 
   Outsider is programmed to follow and kill Einstein (and anything or 
   anyone else that gets in it's way). After Einstein escapes to a local

   and ripping out his intestines), detectives Murphy (Mark Hamill) and Brody<A HREF="watchers_reborn_1998.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/watchers reborn vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="264" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   (Gary Collins) investigate the murder and Einstein attaches himself 
   to Brody, who takes him home. When Brody is murdered by the Outsider 
   that night (his hand is yanked off and his eyes ripped out), Murphy 
   wants to handle the case, but his commanding officer, Captain Dekker 
   (Floyd Levine), pulls him off the case when Agent Johnson (Stephen 
   Macht), a brutal NSA agent, shows up at the crime scene and takes 
   over. Murphy then discovers Einstein hiding in his car and takes him 
   home, where he quickly finds out how intelligent Einstein really is 
   (Einstein spells out his name with barbeque sauce on the kitchen 
   floor!). Murphy contact a doctor named Grace (Lisa Wilcox), who he 
   met at the zoo, not aware that she is actually a member of the 
   top-secret experiment. When Murphy saves Grace from the clutches of 
   the Outsider, she fesses-up to him about the whole sordid affair. 
   Murphy, Grace and Einstein hide out in a remote mountain cabin until 
   they can figure out their next move. Murphy, who lost his wife and 
   young daughter in a tragic fire a short time before, becomes highly 
   protective of Grace and Einstein (he considers them his new surrogate 
   family) and it's not long before the trio is battling both Agent 
   Johnson and the Outsider to keep their new family unit safe. I'm 
   beginning to get that warm and fuzzy feeling inside me!&nbsp; The 
   first thing you'll notice about this film is that the Outsider has 
   reverted back to the fur-covered creature of the first film, albeit 
   with a more animatronic head (and it speaks this time!). Director

   makeup effects through his Magical Media Industries (MMI) outfit, 
   sprinkles gory bits of violence throughout the film (eye removals, 
   limb-yanking, manual heart removal), but it's nothing more than the 
   same rehashed plot of the first two films (The screenplay was written 
   by Sean Dash, the director and scripter of the Tonya Harding-starring 
   action abomination <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Breakaway">BREAKAWAY</A></B> 
   [1995]). The film really falters during the final third, when the 
   Outsider kidnaps Grace and she leaves a trail of oranges (!) in the 
   road so Einstein and Murphy can track her. Mark Hamill (my, how the 
   mighty have fallen!) looks embarrassed working alongside a dog, but 
   it couldn't possibly be any worse than acting next to a Wookie.

    cheat to U.S. audiences because he is a wax figure that speaks in 
   Spanish [in dialogue taken from other Spanish Films] and we are not 
   even given any English translation!) and mix them in with modern-day 
   gore, much of it the &quot;torture porn&quot; variety (no CGI here, 
   which lifts it a peg in my book, even if I am not a fan of torture 
   porn). The end result is mixed, but there is no doubt in my mind that 
   Jack Taylor is still one scary dude and most of the other 
   &quot;old-timers&quot; make this film worth watching. I can't say the 
   same thing about the rest of the cast, who look like amateurs when 
   compared to the people I just talked about. Director/co-screenwriter 
   V&iacute;ctor Matellano does a good job of making the few sets he 
   works with as creepy as possible (he also just finished directing a 
   remake of Jose Ramon Larraz's <B><A HREF="vampyres_2015.htm">VAMPYRES</A></B> 
   [2015] and made the Spanish documentary <B><A HREF="clawing_a_journey_through_the_spanish_horror_2013.htm">CLAWING!
    A JOURNEY THROUGH THE SPANISH HORROR</A></B> in 2013) and 
   co-screenwriter Hugo Stuven Casasnovas has just directed/wrote his 
   first horror film <B><A HREF="anomalous_2015.htm">ANOMALOUS</A></B> 
   (2015). So, I will say that the state of Spanish horror films is now 
   flourishing again. And that makes me happy. But, let's get back to 
   this film (it is filmed in English with a few scenes in Spanish 
   thrown in): A young writer named Mike (Jimmy Shaw) gets an assignment 
   from his Producer (Geraldine Chaplin) to spend a night at the 
   extremely eerie Vista Wax Museum, which she has outfitted with a 
   bunch of hidden cameras, along with the wax museum's security system. 
   A wax figure of notorious serial killer Dr Knox (Jack Taylor; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Pieces">PIECES</A></B> 
   - 1982, and too many other Spanish horror films to mention here. Let 
   me just say this: It is good to still have him around) has just been 
   introduced and even it gives me the willies looking at it. The 
   problem may be that Mike is not the only one in the wax museum that 
   night. Dr. Knox (who is due to be extradited to a U.S prison from a 
   Barcelona prison, where he is to be executed immediately; he has a 
   Charles Manson-like following) may also be in the museum and he gets 
   off on graphically killing people in ways that are so disgusting, the 
   DVD should have come with a barf bag for those with weak stomachs. 
   The film actually starts with the following quote from French poet 
   Christian Bobin: &quot;It's a fact that life take out our heart, if 
   not...this is not life.&quot; We them watch Dr. Knox pull a cover off 
   a topless girl (her eyes seem to be glued shut with molten wax and 
   her mouth and vagina region are covered with duct tape) as he removes 
   one of her fingernails with Hemostats. The woman has a pleasant 
   memory about her husband and son having a good time at the beach 
   before reality takes her to the present as Dr. Knox kills her by 
   cutting into her chest with a scalpel. We are shown how every wax 
   figure got their own effigy in the museum (the film's best sequence) 
   as Mike pushes the wheelchair-bound, eyepatch-wearing curator of the 
   museum, Mr. Jarrod (Denis Rafter), through the museum, showing him 
   how to use the security system and warning Mike that there are some 
   &quot;blind spots&quot; in the security camera's system. He also 
   tells Mike that there are three reasons why anyone would want to 
   spend a night at a wax museum: 1) The money. 2) Because he's a 
   sadist. and 3) He is totally crazy. Mr. Jarrod also mentions a 
   similar incident that happened at this wax museum ten years ago, but 
   refuses to tell Mike how it ended. A weird wax figure (which the 
   curator calls an &quot;automaton&quot;) that is able to turn its head 
   and move its lips (and talks in the voice of Paul Naschy) speaks in 
   Spanish and the curator says it is a quote from the Book Of 
   Revelations and takes it to mean a bad omen for Mike to spend the 
   night at the wax museum (he doesn't realize how right he is). He also 
   shows Mike the Tunnel Of Terror and mentions that he must know who 
   Dr, Knox is, because that is where his wax figure is kept (there a 
   hidden camera on that figure at all times). We then see a flashback 
   where Dr. Knox picks up a hooker in his black Mercedes, takes her to 
   an undisclosed location and she strips. Dr. Knocks knocks her out and 
   she wakes up tied to a table, while Dr. Knox cuts off her ear and 
   cuts out one of her eyes. The flashback ends. Or was it a flashback 
   at all? Mike's friend Steve (Alito Rogers) leaves him with a 
   videotape and a cell phone and then leaves, locking the door behind 
   him. Mike watches the videotape, which is of the Producer telling 
   Mike he can't leave the wax museum until 8:00am the following morning 
   and that the cell phone has been tinkered with so no outside calls 
   can be made. Only she can call him and she plans on calling him at 
   4:00am to check-up on his progress. She then goes on to tell him 
   something he doesn't know. Her company is making a show called 
   &quot;The Mysteries Of The Wax Museum&quot;. She goes on to explain 
   that throughout the years strange and unexplainable events have 
   happened at the Vista Wax Museum and that Steve has supplied him with 
   bags of video cameras and batteries to record his exploits. It is at 
   this time that the film partially becomes a &quot;found footage&quot; 
   film, as Mike films his exploits, showing footage on a monitor next 
   to the figure of Dr. Knox of some of his bloody exploits, but he 
   stops it and puts another camera near the wax figure of Dr. Knox. 
   Suddenly, the video begins playing on the monitor again, as we watch 
   Dr. Knox pouring molten wax in a poor girl's eyes (the same girl we 
   saw in the beginning and then eating his victim's internal organs 
   while she is still alive. We then see another Dr. Knox flashback, 
   where he cuts out a girl's eyes because he thinks there is a bird 
   trapped behind them (I wonder if it was a hummingbird?). Mike begins 
   to start experiencing strange things, such as a red rubber ball (the 
   same type Dr, Knox used to gag his victims) disappearing from the 
   hand of a wax Alfred Hitchcock. So many strange things happen, that 
   when the Producer calls Mike at 4:00am to<A HREF="wax_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/wax 2014 dvd8a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="189" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   tell him Dr. Knox has escaped, Mike is not surprised. What does 
   surprise him is that Dr. Knox escaped from prison long before Mike 
   was trapped in the wax museum, so it looks as if Mike is being set up 
   to be a victim for reality television (believe me, we are slowly 
   getting there on real TV). When Mike discovers that the 
   &quot;wax&quot; figure of Dr. Knox was actually the real Dr. Knox (a 
   scene that is expertly done and sent shivers down my spine), a game 
   of cat-and-mouse comes into play. Mike watches a video where Dr. Knox 
   eats the rotting flesh of his dead wife Noria (Yolanda Font). It is 
   at this point whether we must decide if Mike's Producer is staging 
   all of this for ratings, especially since the electricity goes out 
   and we have to watch everything happen in that sickly green night 
   vision. Mike is captured by Dr. Knox, who says he is going to eat 
   him. Dr. Knox says he will be enjoying this slices of Mike's liver, 
   spleen and pancreas and as a refreshing beverage, he will extract 
   some liquid from Mike's liver capsule and as an appetizer, he will be 
   eating another rare part of Mike's body (Try as I might, I couldn't 
   make this part out). We then see Dr. Knox cut open Mike's chest with 
   a scalpel and then pull out pieces of Mike's body (Be aware that Mike 
   is awake for all this!). Dr. Knox then puts his hand through Mike's 
   sternum to pull out his liver. Dr. Knox then makes Mike eat his own 
   body parts by shoving a funnel down his throat. Dr. Knox then puts a 
   live rat into Mike's body, as Mike strikes Dr. Knox's face, revealing 
   it was made of wax. When the Producer enters the wax museum in the 
   morning and finds Mike dead (She was setting him up the whole time 
   because she knew he was unstable since his wife's death), the coroner 
   (Lone Fleming) pronounces him dead due to a heart attack. It makes 
   sense except for the rather confusing ending (I think it helps if you 
   are Spanish, but the thrust of the story is that most the bad things 
   we saw happening was actually going through Mike's mind [the ones 
   that weren't were supplied by the Producer] because he was mentally 
   unstable and the Producer knew that and decided to make a hit reality 
   show displaying his death). Believe me when I say that most reality 
   show producers would kill (literally!) to have a chance like this in 
   real life as long as they are not implicated or found legally 
   responsible. I simply cannot stand torture porn (and I hate that term 
   just as much as I hate the acts myself, but it has become genre 
   venacular), but Jack Taylor is just so damned terrifying (director 
   V&iacute;ctor Matellano has said on record that <B><A HREF="wax_2014b.htm">WAX</A></B> 
   would not have been made if Taylor turned down this role), I was 
   willing to overlook all the gore for gore's sake just to listen to 
   Jack Taylor talk. His demeanor in this film is as a very soothing, 
   even when he is cutting out a woman's eyes or cutting out a heart. 
   Jack Taylor would have made a damn fine Hannibal &quot;The 
   Cannibal&quot; Lecter. Let's hope that Matellano breaks out of the 
   torture porn &amp; found footage mode and makes a regular horror 
   film. He has a great eye for creating atmosphere but he needs to show 
   gore (which I am not against) in a more traditional manner. You 
   remember, like they use to do back in the 70's. Also starring 
   Almudena Le&oacute;n, Saturnino Garc&iacute;a, Vicky Luengo, Manuel

    arrives in London to interview Edgar Allan Poe (Klaus Kinski; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DeathSmilesMurder73">DEATH
    SMILES ON A MURDERER</A></B> - 1973), finding Poe regaling a group 
   of people with one of his stories about life after death (actually 
   reciting verbatim from Poe's short story &quot;Berenice&quot;). Alan 
   asks Poe why the majority of his stories always touch on that 
   subject, because he couldn't possibly believe in life after death, it 
   is not real. Poe looks at Alan and says it is, indeed, real, his 
   stories are based on true-life incidents that happened to him. Alan 
   thinks it is hogwash and he is interrupted by Lord Thomas Blackwood 
   (Enrico Osterman; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Church1989">THE CHURCH</A></B> 
   - 1989), who tells Poe not to judge Alan too harshly because he comes 
   from a new country that doesn't believe in ghosts, they only believe 
   in what they can touch and feel. Lord Blackwood then wagers ten 
   pounds (originally a hundred pounds, but Alan says that is too rich 
   for him) that he could not spend one night in his Providence Castle, 
   telling Alan that many have tried, but none of them were ever seen or 
   heard from again. Alan takes him up on the bet, telling everyone that 
   when you are dead, that is it, everything after death is nothing but 
   blackness, so Alan, Lord Blackwood and Poe take a two hour carriage 
   ride to Providence Castle, Lord Blackwell handing Alan a loaded 
   pistol, saying he might have need for it. Once arriving at the 
   castle, Lord Blackwood gives Alan the key to the castle's heavy iron 
   gate, which is adorned with sharp talon-like spikes and Alan tells 
   Lord Blackwood and Poe that he will see them at dawn, not knowing 
   that he is about to experience a living nightmare that will shatter 
   his belief system down to its core.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As soon as Alan opens the gate, strange things begin to happen, like 
   the gate slamming shut on its own. As Alan enters the castle with a 
   torch, he can see that the castle hasn't been lived in for years, as 
   the chandeliers and all the furniture are covered in thick cobwebs. 
   He also notices that all the painting covering the walls are those of 
   beautiful women, but one of them is not a painting at all, rather 
   it's a flesh and blood (?) woman, who introduces herself to Alan as 
   Elizabeth Blackwood Perkins (Michele Mercier; <B><A HREF="cemetery_without_crosses_1969.htm">CEMETERY
    WITHOUT CROSSES</A></B> - 1969), Lord Blackwood's sister (When Alan 
   tells Elizabeth that Lord Blackwood told him that the castle was 
   unoccupied, she says, &quot;Oh, well, because, you see, as far as 
   he's concerned...I'm dead.&quot;). She tells Alan that she has been 
   living in the upper floors of the castle for years and to pardon the 
   condition of the main floor because she hasn't had servants for quite 
   some time. She also tells Alan that she prepared a room for him and 
   he wants to know how she knew he was coming, but Elizabeth says 
   nothing, leading him to his room. Once in the room, Elizabeth asks 
   Alan if he would mind if she stays the night with him and Alan says 
   no, so they lay on the bed together, Alan's head on Elizabeth's 
   heaving bosom. Suddenly, Alan lifts his head and calls out 
   Elizabeth's name, telling her that he couldn't hear her heart 
   beating. Elizabeth tells him not to be ridiculous, but before she can 
   say any more, the bedroom door swings open and Julia (Karin Field; <B><A HREF="cave_of_the_living_dead_1964.htm">CAVE
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> - 1964; <B><A HREF="hunchback_of_soho_1966.htm">THE
    HUNCHBACK OF SOHO</A></B> - 1966) appears, telling Elizabeth to 
   leave Alan's room immediately, she knows what she is up to and it is 
   not going to happen again. Both women leave the room (Alan recognizes 
   Julia from her painting downstairs), but Alan, who is smitten, goes 
   looking for Elizabeth and brings her back to his room. Just as they 
   are about to make love, a man named Herbert (Raf Baldassarre; <B><A HREF="blindman_1971.htm">BLINDMAN</A></B> 
   - 1971) comes barging into the room, stabs Elizabeth in the stomach 
   with a dagger (leaving it sticking out of her body) and runs out of 
   the room. Alan grabs his pistol and gives chase, shooting Herbert in 
   the back. Herbert falls down the stairs, but when his body falls on 
   the main floor, it disappears, befuddling Alan. He then runs back to 
   his room to check on Elizabeth, but she's not there, not even a drop 
   of blood anywhere. Alan goes looking for Elizabeth, but finds Dr. 
   Carmus (Peter Carsten; Margheriti's <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#AndGodCain1970">AND
    GOD SAID TO CAIN</A></B> - 1970) instead. Dr. Carmus was a scientist 
   and author of books on the subject of the metaphysical sciences, that 
   one day just up and disappeared. He tells Alan, who has read his 
   books (but disagrees with their conclusions), that he came to the 
   castle to research how the human senses continue to survive long 
   after death, which Alan finds unbelievable. Dr. Carmus then pulls out 
   a box with a highly poisonous snake inside, cuts off its head and 
   asks Alan if he believes the snake is dead. Alan says yes, so Dr. 
   Carmus tells him to pick up the snakes severed head. When Alan tries 
   to do it, the snake hisses at him, Dr. Carmus telling him that the 
   snake's sense of self-preservation and danger outlives its death, 
   proving to Alan that the senses outlive death. Alan still doesn't 
   believe him, saying it may be true for simple animals, but not for 
   human beings. Dr. Carmus then shows Alan more proof that will haunt 
   Alan till the day he dies, which may not be very long.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The cobweb-filled main floor of the castle suddenly becomes clean 
   and active, as Alan watches Elizabeth throw a party welcoming her 
   husband, William (Silvano Tranquilli; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SmileBeforeDeath72">SMILE
    BEFORE DEATH</A></B> - 1972), back to England after a long stay in 
   America. William gives Elizabeth an expensive diamond necklace and 
   promises her that he is back in England for good, no longer will he 
   be making long trips to America because he sold all his business 
   interests there, leaving him more time to spend with his wife. 
   Elizabeth is happy to hear it, but by the look on her face something 
   is bothering her. That something is Herbert, who works in the 
   castle's stables and is having an affair with Elizabeth. Herbert 
   refuses to give her up, secretly pulling her away from the party and 
   telling Elizabeth that he wants her to tell her husband about the 
   affair, but Elizabeth tells him the affair is over, she loves 
   William. As Alan watches helplessly (every time he tries to 
   intervene, a supernatural force holds him back, frozen in his tracks) 
   as the night of happiness turns into a night of deception and death, 
   making Alan finally believe in life after death. Everyone in the 
   castle is cursed to relive this day over and over for all eternity, 
   but does that also include Alan? As dawn approaches, Alan runs 
   outside, while the ghosts of the castle say to him over and over, 
   &quot;Your blood is our life!&quot;, making it to the front gate and 
   exclaiming that he has won the wager and is now ten pounds richer.

   its talon-like spikes, killing him. The carriage containing Poe and

   an eternity to believe in life after death, as he now has no other choice.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This atmospheric and rather creepy Gothic horror film works on many 
   levels, the most obvious being the castle itself, which is a 
   character all on its own. One never knows what is around any of its 
   many dark and shadowy corners. <A HREF="antonio_margheriti_films_on_amazon_prime.htm">Antonio

    DEATHS IN THE CAT'S EYE</A></B> (1973), certainly knows what he 
   wants from a castle, making it so goosebump-inducing and deadly, the 
   viewer can't help but be creeped out. Both Klaus Kinski and Anthony 
   Franciosa are dubbed by other people and, at first, it is hard to 
   relate to their characters (especially if you know what they actually 
   sound like, as do I), but you will quickly forget about it and just 
   enjoy the film for all its creepy excesses. The sequence where 
   Elizabeth makes her initial appearance to Alan is so well done, you 
   will rewind and play it several times to see where her portrait ends 
   and she begins. As a matter of fact, this film is full of expertly 
   handled sequences, making this film required viewing for all those 
   who love supernatural horror. While not particularly bloody or 
   violent and lacking nudity, this film doesn't really need it and I 
   believe you will agree. Sometimes the scariest things are those you 
   cannot see. This movie is all about giving you the chills, which it 
   does in spades.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    TO THE JUNGLE</A><A NAME="WelcomeToTheJungle"></A> (2006) -</B> 
   Boring &quot;first-person&quot; modern-day jungle cannibal flick that 
   mixes fact with fiction which, ultimately, leaves the viewer with 
   more questions than answers. In 1961, Michael Rockefeller, the 23 
   year-old son of a rich and influential Vice President of the United 
   States, disappeared while taking part in an expedition into the 
   jungles of Papua New Guinea. After a long and exhaustive search with 
   no expense spared, all hope was lost in finding him alive, the 
   consensus being that he either drowned or was eaten by a tribe of 
   primitive cannibals. That's the true part. What happens next is pure 
   fiction. In the present day, Mandi (Sandi Gardiner), Colby (Callard 
   Harris), Bijou (Veronica Sywak) and Mikey (Nickolas Richey), hear a 
   rumor that a helicopter pilot spotted a 70 year-old white man living 
   among a tribe of cannibals in the New Guinea jungle. Thinking that it 
   could be Michael Rockefeller and they could get at least a million 
   dollars for a video interview, the foursome take their video camera 
   (which never seems to be turned off or run out of battery power) and 
   head into the jungle to search for him. After spending entirely too 
   much time documenting their personal and sexual lives, the foursome 
   finally make it into the jungle, where they spend way too much time 
   goofing off, either getting drunk, smoking pot or arguing amongst 
   each other over petty things (They even run into a husband/wife team 
   of Christian missionaries and Mikey hits on the wife!). Bijou and 
   Mikey constantly ho<A HREF="welcome_to_the_jungle_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/welcome to the jungle dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="194" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ld-up
    the search, wasting too much time partying and getting up late, 
   causing serious friction between them and Mandi and Colby. They fall 
   five days behind schedule and, after Mikey steals a human skull from 
   a cannibal graveyard and refuses to put it back (even after being 
   warned by a brawny Australian chap that crosses their path), Mikey 
   and Bijou break-off from the group, build a raft, steal the video 
   camera and take off down river without Mindi and Colby. The angry 
   cannibals follow the duo down river and capture them (after putting a 
   couple of arrows into Mikey's back), as Mindi and Colby build their 
   own raft and try to catch up (there's also a &quot;surprise&quot; 
   development here that should have all the viewers raising their hands 
   up in the air in total disbelief). They find Mikey and Bijou (not 
   pretty sights), only to end up as cannibal chow themselves. The final 
   shot shows an old white man picking up the camera and walking off 
   into the jungle. Which raises two questions: Is it Michael 
   Rockefeller? How did this footage find it's way to civilization? I'm 
   afraid those are two questions (among many others) that are never 
   answered. This <B><A HREF="cannibal_holocaust_1980.htm">CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST</A></B>-wannabe

   [2003], which was also released under the title <B><A HREF="rundown_2003.htm">WELCOME
    TO THE JUNGLE</A></B>), shot entirely through the lens of a 
   hand-held digital video camera, suffers greatly from a cast of 
   extremely unlikable characters and taking it's own sweet time getting 
   to the good stuff. Nearly an hour passes before we even glimpse a 
   cannibal and the film loses all credibility when it is revealed, 
   after Mikey and Bijou are captured by the cannibals, that Mandi hid a 
   second digital video camera in her backpack without anyone else 
   knowing about it (I moaned so loud at this reveal that my neighbor 
   thought I was in labor!). It's plot contrivances like this that sink 
   the film and it never recovers. The majority of the film is nothing 
   but four greedy, irresponsible people arguing with each other ad 
   infinitum, with a quick, bloody final denouement. I don't know about 
   you, but I'm growing extremely tired of these <B><A HREF="blair_witch_project_1999.htm">BLAIR
    WITCH</A></B>-style productions. While it's not as herky-jerky or 
   nausea-inducing as <B>WITCH</B> or <B><A HREF="cloverfield_2007.htm">CLOVERFIELD</A></B>

   from his first directorial effort, 2004's <B><A HREF="punisher_2004.htm">THE
    PUNISHER</A></B>) offers nothing new to the cannibal genre, besides 
   the Rockefeller plot device. Even the graphic, unrated gore in the 
   film's final 25 minutes is nothing you haven't seen before (Mikey 
   laying on the ground, still alive, with his arms and legs missing; 
   Colby being eviscerated and eaten; a quick shot of Mindi's body cut 
   in half) and the film's standout gore sequence, where Bijou is 
   hanging in the air by a bamboo pole shoved through her mouth and out 
   the back of her head, is nothing but a less-invasive take-off of <B>CANNIBAL
    HOLOCAUST</B>'s shot of a woman in a similar situation. About the 
   only good aspect of this production is the beautiful location 
   photography shot on the island of Fiji (substituting for New Guinea). 
   Otherwise, you are going to have to slog through endless scenes of 
   in-fighting from a cast of petty people in order to view a couple of 
   minutes (maximum) of quick gore shots, making this 82 minute film 
   seem twice as long than it really is. It's hard to believe that Gale

   (1978) -</B> For the few of us who suffered through director Paul W. 
   Kener's <B><A HREF="#SavageWater">SAVAGE WATER</A></B> (1979), here's 
   his first film, an equally inept and boring take on an old Native 
   American folklore tale, that Kener wrote, directed (both using the 
   pseudonym &quot;Rodger Darbonne&quot;), edited, photographed and 
   co-produced (with Raymond H. Smith). The story structure is similar 
   to <B>SAVAGE WATER</B>, only instead of a rafting trip, a group of 
   outdoor types, headed by Frank Benson (Ron Berger, the star of <B>SAVAGE
    WATER</B>), take a helicopter into the Wyoming wilderness (filmed on 
   location in Teton National Park) to go on a moose hunt. Once on the 
   ground, Frank, Connie (Carole Cochrell) and Eric (Cameron Garnick) 
   meet their guides, the bull-headed Cajun Defago (Van Washburn Jr.) 
   and Indian Billy (Victor Lawrence), and they all watch the helicopter 
   explode in mid-air, forcing the pilot, Mike (Robert Steffen), to jump 
   into a lake. Defago and Billy grab a canoe and save Mike, who tells 
   everyone that a mysterious wind suddenly appeared and destroyed the 
   helicopter and it may be more than a week before a search party 
   reaches them. Billy then tells everyone the legend of the Wendigo, 
   the &quot;Spirit of the Black Wind&quot;, and how it bodes badly for 
   everyone in this neck of the woods. Defago elaborates on the story, 
   telling the group over a campfire the story of an Indian chief named<A HREF="wendigo_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/wendigo 1978 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="146" HEIGHT="246" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Wendigo (flashback alert!). Wendigo and his family are starving 
   during a bad winter storm and resort to cannibalism, eating the 
   corpses of members of other tribes who have frozen to death. When 
   members from the other tribes find out, they tie Wendigo to a tree 
   and burn him to death, with Wendigo cursing all those who enter his 
   territory with bloody deaths with his dying breath. After hearing 
   this campfire tale, the group decides to continue on their 
   moose-hunting trip, with disastrous results. While Connie stays back 
   at the camp with a concerned Billy (who performs an Indian ritual 
   while Connie takes a nude dip in the river), the others go on their 
   moose hunt, but the constant clicking of photographer Eric's camera 
   chases away the only moose they see all day. Connie (who is quite the 
   slut, sleeping with Frank and Billy) agrees to take a midnight canoe 
   ride with Mike to a mysterious island in the middle of a lake that 
   both Billy and Defago warned them to avoid, as it is believed to be 
   the Wendigo's home. Connie ends up leaving Mike alone on the island 
   when a mysterious wind blows in and Mike is killed&nbsp; by the 
   Wendigo (it's really too damn dark to see what's going on, though). 
   One-by-one, everyone is killed, starting with Billy (hung upside down 
   on a tree), then Eric (bloodlessly torn in half), then Frank (his 
   rifle explodes in his face) and, finally, Defago (who is impaled on a 
   tree branch in the film's only gory scene). Only Connie escapes, but 
   at what price?&nbsp; Just like <B>SAVAGE WATER</B>, the fault of <B>WENDIGO</B> 
   is that it is just too damn talky and slow with very little action or 
   horror to break-up the monotony. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing 
   against dialogue-heavy films, just as long as accomplished actors 
   speak the words, but you'll find none of them in this film. Everyone 
   here speaks in monotone, except for Van Washburn Jr. as Defago, who 
   over-emotes constantly with his phony French Louisiana accent, 
   spitting out lines like, &quot;You no want sandweeech?&quot; like 
   everyone's life depended on it. Jack-of-all-trades Paul W. Kener (who 
   disappeared into obscurity after this and <B>SAVAGE WATER</B>) is a 
   master of none of them, as the direction is languid, the 
   cinematography static, the editing sub-par and the screenplay 
   bottom-of-the-barrel. The violence on display (when you see it, that 
   is, as most of it happens at night under less than professional 
   lighting) never arises above a PG rating level. There's nothing here 
   that is remotely interesting or entertaining, including the reveal of 
   the Wendigo monster during the finale (it's nothing but a 
   superimposed mask being waved around on a double-exposed background). 
   That's a shame, because this film has been one of those elusive 
   rarities that has been on my &quot;must see&quot; list for over 
   thirty years. Nothing is more disappointing than finding a film after 
   a long, lengthy search only to discover that it is a boring piece of 
   shit. I can't say I was surprised after watching Kener's <B>SAVAGE WATER</B>,
    but a little part of me was hoping for something better. Oh well, 
   live and learn. Also starring Frank Lansing as the Wendigo. Other

   film. Director Fessenden is also interested in the family dynamic and 
   what small things, that most people would find insignificant, can do 
   to the psyche of a child. Fessenden shoots the entire film with a 
   sense of dread, which makes the shots of snowflakes even seem truly

   A scientist and his two assistants, who are searching for the 
   Abominable Snowman&nbsp; in the mountains of Katmandu, Nepal, are 
   attacked and killed by the said creature (in one of the most 
   threadbare Yeti costumes in film history) before their findings can 
   be reported. Professor Lacombe, a friend of the scientist, acquires 
   the dead scientist's satchel, which contains the scalp of a Yeti, as 
   well as photos and papers dealing with the creature. The Professor 
   plans on capturing a Yeti, so he travels to Katmandu with his 
   daughter Sylvia (Grace Mills) and anthropologist Waldemar Daninsky 
   (Paul Naschy), only to find heavy snows have blocked them from 
   traveling up the mountain. Waldemar catches wind of a rumor of a 
   secret pass in the mountains that is always open, so he hires an 
   alcoholic guide (no sober guide would be caught dead doing this) and 
   they head to the pass alone. The guide suddenly disappears (after 
   rambling about &quot;red devils&quot; roaming the area), leaving 
   Waldemar to wander the landscape hopelessly lost and running out of 
   food. He miraculously stumbles upon a cave occupied by two beautiful 
   women, who are lonely cannibalistic vampires! They nurse Waldemar 
   back to health, make love to him and then bite him when he discovers 
   them feasting on the body parts of his alcoholic guide. He manages to 
   kill both of the women with a handy silver arrow (Why in the world 
   would two cannibal vampires keep their only means of destruction so 
   readily available?), but the <A HREF="werewolf_and_the_yeti_1975b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/werewolf and the yeti vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="154" HEIGHT="267" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>bite
    on his chest has turned him into a werewolf (Don't question why, 
   just go along with it!). Meanwhile, the Professor, Sylvia and their 
   group abandon their search for the Yeti and concentrate on finding 
   Waldemar, who is roaming the snowy countryside ripping-out the 
   throats of anyone who crosses his path. The Professor and his men are 
   captured by the notorious Sekkar Khan (Luis Induni), a vicious local 
   warlord, and brought to his castle. Luckily, Sylvia escapes only to 
   be nearly raped by three of Khan's men, but werewolf Waldemar kills 
   them before they hurt her. The next morning, the human Waldemar 
   hooks-up with Sylvia (who doesn't yet know that Waldemar is the 
   werewolf she encountered earlier) and they go looking for the 
   Professor, who Khan hopes can cure him of a fatal skin disease. When 
   Waldemar and Sylvia stop at a monastery to rest, Waldemar learns of a 
   magic plant with red flowers that will cure him of his affliction. He 
   leaves without Sylvia to search for the plant, but not before she 
   sees him transform into a werewolf (She's surprisingly unfazed!). 
   Sylvia and Waldemar are then kidnapped by Khan and brought to his 
   castle. After breaking free and escaping from Khan and his 
   witch-woman assistant, Sylvia is abducted by a Yeti. Waldemar changes 
   into his alter ego and battles the Yeti to the death. Sylvia finds 
   the magic plant growing nearby and uses it to free Waldemar from his 
   curse. Did you get all that?&nbsp; This is the eighth in the series 
   of werewolf films featuring Paul Naschy as the eternally-cursed 
   Waldemar Daninsky (It follows <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CurseOfTheDevil1973">CURSE

    The script, by Naschy (using his real name, Jacinto Molina), seems 
   to try to toss-in every clich&eacute; in the book and see what 
   sticks, making this an outlandish but, lesser, entry in the series. 
   The plot is all over the place, giving us Yetis, werewolves, 
   vampires, warlords, magic flowers and a mysterious woman named 
   Wandesa (Silvia Solar), who has evil magic powers. As a result, 
   there's not enough time spent on any given plot point for the viewer 
   to get emotionally involved, making the entire film seem overly 
   disjointed. The entire film seems like pieces are missing, like pages 
   of the script were discarded during filming (especially during the 
   search for the magic plant), even though the version I viewed is the 
   complete, unedited print. Thankfully, after a slow first thirty

   (in severely edited form; this version of the film has fallen into 
   the Public Domain and has been released by many budget companies on 
   both VHS and DVD), Anchor Bay has released a beautiful unedited 
   widescreen print, restoring all the previously removed gore and 
   nudity. This is the fourth in the series of the exploits of Waldemar 
   Daninsky and is one of the best. The dubbing is surprisingly good for 
   a Spanish feature (it actually looks as though some of the actors 
   were speaking English) and the gore is pretty explicit for a feature 
   made in 1970. There are torn throats, blood drinking, impalements, 
   stakings, decapitations and other gruesome events. There's also 
   plenty of nudity on view and a lot of it is mixed in with the 
   violence. Director Leon Klimovsky, who also directed Naschy in <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Dr. Jekyll Wolfman">DR.

   and whenever vampires are on-screen, they move in an almost lyrical 
   way that is greatly enhanced by the slow-motion photography. If

   to it's original running time. Since the restored footage was never 
   dubbed into English, that footage is in the original Spanish language 
   with English subtitles. The DVD also has an informative 15 minute

    EVIL LIVES</A><A NAME="WhereEvilLives94"></A> (1994) -</B> Everyone 
   who reads this site knows I hate anthology films, but since this was 
   Claude Akins' last film and it sat in the shelf from 1994 until Troma 
   released it on DVD (in fullscreen, of course) in 2012, I said, 
   &quot;What the hell, lets give it a look.&quot; I wish I didn't. The 
   film opens up with rich guy Blake Rutherford II (James Coffey) 
   getting out of his vintage Rolls Royce with beautiful female realtor 
   Brandy Wine (Faye McKenzie) to look at the very expensive Spencer 
   Mansion, Brandy gets a call and has to beg off for a while and tells 
   him to ask the groundskeeper to give him details. He meets 
   groundskeeper Jack Devlin (Akins) as he is digging a hole with a 
   shovel, who tells him that the mansion has a very sordid history. His 
   first tale (&quot;Hubert's Homecoming&quot; by director and 
   screenwriter Stephan A. Maier) starts off in 1969, when Hubert (Peter 
   Zaff) walks into the Stafford Mansion (which was a college dormitory 
   at the time) and indiscriminately shoots<A HREF="where_evil_lives_1994.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/where evil lives 1991 dvd front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   everyone he sees (he shoots a couple playing Twister and then finds a 
   girl hiding in the bathroom, puts the gun in her mouth and pulls the 
   trigger). When he runs out of bullets, he pulls a Marlin off the 
   wall, says &quot;Party's over!&quot; and we see him stab a guy hiding 
   behind a bed over and over with the Marlin's blade-like nose, the 
   blood covering Hubert's face (We see a Yogi Bear lamp dripping with 
   blood). He is sent to prison for life, but an asshole working for an 
   Innocence-like project is able to get Hubert off on parole in the mid-80's.
    His parents left him a house and his old vintage Thunderbird, but no 
   money, because they spent it all paying lawyers to defend him. The 
   asshole guy leaves and says he will be back tomorrow to find him a 
   job and Hubert pulls a female doll out of his pocket, who he calls 
   &quot;Betty&quot;, and combs her hair. He then washes his car for 
   about two hours, which catches the attention of his neighbors, who 
   are sitting together on a lawn. One of them walks over to Hubert to 
   see what he is doing. He says, &quot;I'm going back to college 
   again!&quot; and hands the doll over to the guy, telling him to 
   &quot;take good care of Betty!&quot; Yes, Hubert is still as mad as a 
   hatter and when he drives to the Spencer Mansion, he must have missed 
   the big sign that says &quot;Spencer House College Closed&quot;. 
   Hubert finds the house empty, which upsets him, so he goes upstairs 
   to take a look, all the while singing a song whose lyrics are 
   &quot;Fuck you Spencer College!&quot; He begins hearing voices 
   calling his name and suddenly he is surrounded by the ghosts of the 
   people he killed in 1969. They challenge him to a game of 
   &quot;Quarters&quot; (I don't think I have to explain the rules), but 
   the rules have been changed slightly. If Hubert fails to get the 
   quarter into the shotglass, one of the ghosts can shoot him anywhere 
   on his body. Hubert fails at his first try and gets shot in the 
   shoulder. He fails at his second try and gets shot in the other 
   shoulder. He is then made to pick up the quarter with his mouth and 
   make one final try. He fails and we hear a gunshot, but the next shot 
   we see is Hubert being led away from Spencer Mansion in a 
   strait-jacket (with no bullet wounds) rambling-on about ghosts. Looks 
   like he will be spending the rest of his life in a loony bin, with 
   the ghosts to keep him company (we see them dancing around in a 
   circle at their victory). This tale has a pretty bloody beginning, 
   but a poor ending). Jack Devlin keeps on digging while he tells Blake 
   a second story about the mansion which includes the Davis children 
   and vampires&nbsp; (Titled &quot;Midnight Date&quot; by director and 
   screenwriter Kevin G. Nunan). The entire tale is narrated by an adult 
   Jamie Davis (Dawn Carlile, who was looped by someone else!) when she 
   was a young pre-teen (Beth McKenzie), who, along with sister Lori 
   (Carol Rice) and bothers Tommy (James Jackson) and Timmy (Thomas 
   Crooms). sneak into the boarded-up Spencer Mansion. Timmy, who has 
   raging hormones, gets involved with a beautiful vampire who lives 
   there and is soon bitten and becomes a vampire himself. When the 
   young Jamie tells the police what she saw, the police don't believe 
   her and her parents send her to her room (The reasoning of why Timmy 
   never returns home is never brought up, which makes this story 
   exceptionally stupid). The police check out the Spencer Mansion just 
   in case, but they do such a lousy job, they don't even notice blood 
   dripping from one of the door locks. Jamie and Tommy decide to check 
   out the house themselves, armed with garlic, wooden stakes, holy 
   water and a .22 caliber rifle (Where is Lori? Another stupid 
   omission). They find a bowl of Tim's blood with the words 
   &quot;Welcome Home Jamie&quot; written in blood on a wall. Jamie and 
   Tom become separated and Tim tries to bite Jamie, but she has a 
   crucifix to keep him away. Tom shoots the female vampire with no 
   effect, but Jamie stabs her in the back with a stake. The police 
   arrive and kill Tom for carrying a rifle (Really?) and Jamie screams. 
   Years later, we see the adult Jamie and suddenly we find out she has 
   some special &quot;gift&quot; and kills Timmy in his coffin in the 
   Spencer Mansion by hammering a stake in his heart. The family the 
   slays together stays together (This short film is totally worthless 
   for the main reason it totally lacks any cohesion. What about Jamie's 
   parents? What about the reports of vampire murders over the years? It 
   just makes no sense.).&nbsp; Jack Devlin tells Blake one final story 
   (Titled &quot;Saved By The Spell&quot; by director and screenwriter 
   Richard L. Fox Jr.). Jack tells Blake that this mansion was recently 
   called the &quot;Gabriel Manor&quot;. Blake asks if this was the 
   doctor with all kinds of awards that went off the deep end, but Jack 
   tells him there is much more to the story. We open this tale with 
   female detective Jessica Peters (Louise LeTorneau), who is also a 
   white (good) witch, performing some type of ritual involving lots of 
   candles in a circle and a small noose and soon the police find a 
   notorious criminal hanging from his own garage. There is also another 
   sadistic killer named Nico Moretti (Larry Quadagno, listed here as 
   &quot;Larry Q&quot;) roaming the area on a motorcycle that is killing 
   women and stealing their internal organs, supplying them to Dr. Henry 
   Gabriel (Dan Daly) for his nefarious experiments (he not running an 
   illegal organ donor transplant operation). We watch as Nico (who is 
   wearing surgical latex gloves) strangling a woman in her own home. He 
   pulls out a scalpel and removes her kidney (or liver; it's not made 
   clear) and puts it in a plastic sandwich bag, taking off on his 
   motorcycle and handing it over to Dr. Gabriel for an envelope full of 
   money. Dr. Gabriel tells Nico that he needs another organ and Nico 
   agrees to do it if the price is right. The police and the FBI, who 
   are working together, know that Dr. Gabriel and Nico are involved in 
   these crimes but all they have is circumstantial evidence; not enough 
   to arrest them. Nico kills another woman when she cuts him badly in 
   the stomach and he dumps her in a lake. Witch Jessica has two of the 
   three bodily fluids from Nico&nbsp; (blood and urine), but she needs 
   a third bodily fluid to give Nico what he deserves. She is lucky 
   because her best friend is Chief Jim Thompson (Larry Silver), who is 
   a firm believer in her powers. Nico wants out of <A HREF="where_evil_lives_1994.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/where evil lives dvd ad8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="232" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>the
    organ removal business, but Dr. Gabriel talks him into one more job 
   for twice the money. He will not have to remove any organs, but bring 
   an actual body to him. Nico accepts and goes to retrieve the 
   &quot;patient&quot;, but Jessica purposely runs his motorcycle off 
   the road and takes his injured body to her house, where they make 
   love in a shower (she collects his semen, the last bodily fluid she 
   needs to make her spell work). Jim and the FBI go to Gabriel Manor 
   and arrest Dr, Gabriel (after an FBI agent is shot and killed by 
   Gabriel) and his assistant Miss Tessball (Arlee Hendricks), who has a 
   thing for Nico. Unfortunately Jessica's spell makes Nico explode in 
   his car, so it's bye, bye, Nico. (This is the best episode in the 
   trio, but it is still very weak and full of implausible plot 
   holes).&nbsp; Blake tells Jack Devlin that this mansion certainly has 
   a strange history and wants to know what the hole is for. Jack 
   replies, &quot;It's your grave!&quot; and nearly decapitates Blake 
   with the shovel as he pushes him into the hole. Brandy Wine returns 
   and says, &quot;Not bad, Jack!&quot; (as we watch a still-alive Blake 
   bleeding to death in the grave). Jack buries Blake alive while Brandy 
   Wine says she is bringing another interested party to look at the 
   house. Ah, the circle of life. Ain't life grand?&nbsp; Be sure to 
   stay through the end credits for a nice tribute to Claude Akins. The 
   Troma DVD lists the release date as 1989; the IMDb lists it is 1991, 
   while the copyright on the actual film lists it as 1994. This one 
   makes more sense than the other ones because Claude Akins died on 
   January 24. 1994 of cancer at 67 years-old and taking the 
   post-production and editing processes into consideration, it would 
   have to have been filmed then. If it wasn't, why the final tribute to 
   Akins three or five years before he died? Maybe the three episodes 
   were filmed at different times, but the Akins footage was definitely 
   the latest footage in the film (and the most professional-looking). 
   While I have seen worse anthology films out there, Akins is the only 
   professional here and the rest are nothing but Florida locals, most 
   who have never acted before (and it shows). I consider this film to 
   be too cheap and boring to be thought of as entertainment, but it is 
   an important document due to it being Akins' last film. I just wonder 
   why it sat on the shelf for 18 years before finally being released? 
   You should ask that question, too, before you put the DVD into your 
   player. Fans of anthology films may have a better time with this 
   movie than I did. It's all a matter of taste. Everyone's is 
   different, which I why I very rarely condemn a film (Unless it's 
   unredeemable trash like <A HREF="short reviews.htm#AmerHolokaust2013"><B>AMERIKAN

   One thing that always surprised me about Italian Gothic horror films 
   of the '60s is how adult they are in terms of sex, sadomasochism and 
   other sexual perversions. Since this was the early-'60s, there was, 
   of course, no nudity, but filmmakers found a way around that aspect 
   to display their &quot;perversions&quot;. No one was better at that 
   than director Mario Bava (who uses his &quot;John M. Old&quot; 
   pseudonym here for the first time), who also gave us such Gothic 
   horror classics as <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackSunday1960">BLACK

   He was nearly the only one to wrap such sexual proclivities in a 
   colorful, eerily atmospheric package, of which this film is a prime 
   example.&nbsp; It also doesn't hurt that this film has a cast who are 
   well-versed in the Gothic horror genre, all who add their talents to 
   a film that is so memorable and so sexually perverse, it had to be 
   severely re-edited in many countries around the world, including the 
   United States, before it could be released to theaters and then TV. 
   What I will be reviewing is the uncut &quot;European Version&quot;, 
   because the U.S. edit eliminates all the 'perversions', leaving the 
   film a shadow of its former self.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   revenge for her daughter's death. Katia tells her not to say such

   left the castle. Right from the start we can see Kurt is a sadistic 
   son-of-a-bitch, looking at Nevenka (who was playing the piano until 
   she heard Kurt's name, but once she sees him, a look of both fear and 
   passion envelopes her face) with lust in his eyes and it doesn't go 
   unnoticed by the Count and Christian. The Count orders Kurt out of 
   the castle, saying the only reason he returned was to get back 
   everything that he took away from him, including his title and 
   properties that go along with it. Kurt doesn't deny it, saying it was 
   the second reason why he returned. The Count tells him that will 
   never happen and Kurt mysteriously says, &quot;We'll see.&quot; After 
   being ordered out of the castle again by the Count, Christian says 
   no, let him stay; he's not afraid of Kurt and knows his tricks all 
   too well. The Count relents and lets Kurt stay, which makes Giorgia 
   and Losat very angry because he abused servants when he was living at 
   the castle (Tanya being one of them). Kurt stares directly at Giorgia 
   and says it looks like she wants to kill him right now, but she says 
   no, his death will be left up to karma and it will come very soon.

    That night, Kurt pays his father a visit in his bedroom using a 
   secret passageway behind the fireplace, which he used as a child to 
   wish his father a goodnight practically every night. The Count orders 
   him out of his room and Kurt sarcastically says the Count had a 
   totally different attitude when he visited him as a child. The Count 
   replies that back then he was his son, but he no longer is, saying he 
   is too old for such nonsense and he is very ill and close to death. 
   Once he dies, Kurt will know what he thinks of him at the reading of 
   his will. Kurt leaves the room the same way he came in, but this time 
   with a sly smile on his face.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next morning, Nevenka takes a horseback ride on the beach, 
   stopping to sit in the sand and contemplate her life. Kurt sneaks up 
   behind her and tries to kiss her, saying he knows she still loves 
   him, but Nevenka screams out &quot;I hate you! I hate you!&quot; and 
   starts hitting Kurt with the horse's riding crop. Kurt angrily pulls 
   the crop out of her hand and begins whipping Nevenka mercilessly, 
   until the dress she is wearing is tattered and her back is raw and 
   bloody, but she loves it (!), a look of sexual pleasure on her face. 
   Kurt says she hasn't changed and wonders if Christian knows about her 
   sexual perversions. Then he and Nevenka make love on the beach. As 
   nighttime approaches, Nevenka hasn't returned to the castle. Kurt 
   returns and Christian asks him if he has seen Nevenka and he says no, 
   but he better look for her now because it will be impossible to 
   locate her in the dark. Everyone but the Count and Kurt go looking 
   for her and when Kurt is in his room, he hears a noise coming from 
   his terrace window and goes to investigate. Someone hiding behind the 
   curtains stabs Kurt in the neck with the very same dagger Tanya used 
   to kill herself, killing him. Losat and Giorgia find Nevenka 
   unconscious in the moors near the castle and carry her back to the 
   castle. When Giorgia brings Kurt some nighttime tea, she discovers 
   his dead body and screams. Everyone seems relieved that Kurt is dead 
   and the Count takes the dagger and locks it in a drawer in his 
   bedroom, saying no one should ever see the dagger again, it has 
   served its purpose. So who killed Kurt?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A few days later, as Nevenka is playing the piano (apparently, she 
   only knows how to play one tune, but it's appropriately creepy), she 
   sees Kurt staring at her through a window in the pouring rain and 
   screams (the collar on Kurt's shirt is soaked in blood), but when 
   everyone else looks out the window, Kurt is no longer there. That 
   night, Kurt pays Nevenka a visit in her bedroom, his shoes all muddy, 
   as if, according to Nevenka, &quot;He just escaped from his 
   grave&quot;, leaving muddy footprints on the floor. Kurt's hand 
   reaches for Nevenka (A scene filmed so terrifyingly, it gave me 
   nightmares as a kid when I watched it on TV in the mid-'60s) and she 
   shrieks a blood curdling scream, everyone running to her bedroom. She 
   tells Christian that Kurt was there and says to look at the muddy 
   footprints on the floor, but there are none. Christian says it was 
   nothing but a nightmare, but Nevenka is sure it wasn't and says that 
   Kurt is still alive. It should be noted, that at Kurt's funeral, we 
   see his body in a casket as it is carried by four people in red robes 
   and placed in a tomb in the Menliff Family crypt. We also discover 
   that Christian's marriage to Nevenka is one of convenience; he 
   married her just to make the Count happy. Since they don't even sleep 
   in the same bedroom, it's not much of a stretch to discern that they 
   haven't even consummated the marriage (if you know what I mean), so 
   Christian may have no idea of her sexual proclivities. Christian is 
   really in love with Katia and she with him, but they can no longer do 
   anything about it because he is now married (Oh, the 18th Century! 
   Haven't they heard of adultery?).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It's not long before everyone begins seeing muddy footprints on the 
   floor, which lead to Kurt's tomb. They even hear laughter that sounds 
   like it is coming from Kurt. When the Count ends up dead in his bed, 
   stabbed in the neck and the dagger missing from the locked dresser 
   drawer, some believe Kurt is alive, while others believe someone in 
   the castle is responsible. One night, we see Kurt once again whipping 
   Nevenka mercilessly in her bed until she reaches orgasm and when she 
   ends up missing, Christian and Losat follow the muddy footprints in 
   her bedroom that lead to Kurt's tomb. When they open the stone door 
   to the tomb, they discover an unconscious Nevenka inside, very close 
   to death. So is Kurt really alive or is he a ghost? Or is there 
   another explanation?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Christian begins to believe that his brother may actually be alive, 
   so he and Losat go into Kurt's tomb, carry his casket outside and 
   open it. Inside the coffin is a heavily decayed corpse, too far gone 
   from the ravages of nature to identify as Kurt, although the corpse 
   is wearing Kurt's clothes. Just in case Kurt is a ghost (he'll 
   believe anything at this point), Christian douses the corpse with 
   lamp oil and sets it on fire. He and Losat then hear Kurt's laugh and 
   see a shadowy figure in the distance and run after it (Losat falls 
   behind because he walks with a limp for reasons not revealed, but pay 
   close attention to the corpse's twitching, burning feet at this 
   moment if you want to be creeped out!). The fast moving shadowy 
   figure manages to avoid Christian and escapes in the secret 
   passageway in the Count's bedroom and locks it from the inside. 
   Knowing the passage leads to the castle's chapel, Christian and Losat 
   discover who the killer is. If you want to know who it is, you are 
   going to have to watch the film, but I will say this: It may not come 
   as a surprise to today's audiences, but I guarantee it was a surprise 
   to audiences back in 1963. It's a conclusion used in many mystery and 
   psychological thriller films up to this day, but in 1963 it was 
   fairly new.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    You can never go wrong with a Mario Bava film (including <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#PlanetVampires1965">PLANET

    DOGS</A></B> - 1974 and <B><A HREF="#Shock1977">SHOCK</A></B> - 
   1977) and this one is no different. The atmosphere is thick enough to 
   cut with a knife and the cinematography, by Ulbaldo Terzano (as 
   &quot;David Hamilton&quot;; Bava's <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#BloodBlackLace1964">BLOOD
    AND BLACK LACE</A></B> - 1964) and an uncredited Bava, is sumptuous 
   and beyond reproach, especially the scenes inside the castle and the 
   crypt, where around every shadowy corner, danger could pop-out 
   unexpectedly and sometimes does, putting the viewers on edge. There's 
   a sequence in the film where Nevenka hears the sound of a cracking 
   whip (it almost sounds like a dog growling) that will put your nerves 
   on edge unlike any other film from that time period, as she searches 
   for its origin. It is a sequence full of terror and pure beauty, as 
   only Bava could pull it off (Nevenka has a look on her face as if she 
   wishes the cracking whip was tearing at her back and is somewhat 
   disappointed when she finds out what was causing the noise. A very 
   telling scene). The screenplay, by Ernesto Gastaldi (as &quot;Julian 
   Berry&quot;; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LongHairDeath1964">THE LONG 
   HAIR OF DEATH</A></B> - 1964), Ugo Guerra (as &quot;Robert Hugo&quot;;

   - 1969) and Luciano Martino (as &quot;Martin Hardy&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#MurderClinic1966">THE
    MURDER CLINIC</A></B> - 1966), doesn't cow-tow to the audience, 
   something that should please fans of Gothic horror films. This was 
   not a film for kids and was never meant to be, no matter what 
   American and some foreign distributors thought (see next paragraph). 
   The entire cast is excellent, especially Harriet Medin White and 
   Luciano Pigozzi, who are usually <A HREF="whip_and_the_body_1963.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/whip and the body italy poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="207" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>assigned
    minor (but memorable) roles in films, but get a chance to shine 
   here. Steven, my friend from across the pond, describes Pigozzi as 
   Italy's answer to Peter Lorre and it's never truer than in this film. 
   He looks like <A HREF="whip_and_the_body_1963.htm#Pigozzi">he could 
   be Lorre's brother</A> and I don't think it is a coincidence. 
   Christopher Lee is also excellent as the sadist Kurt and although he 
   doesn't dub his own voice here, the person who did (David Sturkie) 
   does a very good job, sounding just like him (Lee, apparently, didn't 
   agree, regretting not dubbing his voice for this film [he was a huge 
   admirer of Bava] and made sure he dubbed his voice on all of his 
   other foreign films from that point on). I'm a huge fan of Italian 
   Gothic horror films and this is one of the best, thanks to Bava being 
   in the director's chair, the cast and the adult material it addresses.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   dinner, have struck a pact with Sir Alfred, waylaying travelers and

   their blood and can their flesh for consumption later on

   much carnage and crazy setpieces that I doubt you&#146;ll be worrying

   chomping down on people in a stalled subway car and various other

   tainted water (after surviving a polar bear attack!), things get even

   stampede scenes greatly enhance the proceedings. I felt uneasy 
   watching real animals hunting down people in a blood frenzy, kind of 
   like witnessing a bad accident on the highway (my cats seemed to

   (1981), where there were seven doors of death? Well, in this, 
   director Fabrizio Laurenti's (here using his &quot;Martin Newlin&quot;
    pseudonym) cut-rate version of the same story, there are only three 
   doors of death, yet they are no-less harmful to your health. A 
   pregnant Linda Blair (yes, you can forget any shower scenes in this 
   film, although she does fall into a <A HREF="witchery_1988b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/witchery vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="113" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>bathtub
    full of blood) travels to a secluded island with her mother, father 
   and nephew and two real estate agents to view a run-down resort hotel 
   that they may buy. The resort has a strange legend attached to it, 
   something about a &quot;witch's light&quot;, which spells doom for 
   whomever sees it. While on the island, they run into David Hasselhoff 
   and his virgin (!) girlfriend Leslie Cumming (Who gives one of the 
   most wooden performances ever. Her line readings are so monotonous in 
   tone, you could time her syllables with a metronome.). They are on 
   the island trying to film the witch's light. Before you can say, 
   &quot;Hey, I'm trapped in a bad Italian horror film!&quot;, they all 
   become stranded on the island and are preyed upon by the Lady In 
   Black (Hildegard Kneff, who wears so much black makeup around her 
   eyes, it looks like she is ready to play cornerback for the N.Y. 
   Giants), a centuries-old witch who systematically kills the 
   occupants. Mom is hung upside-down in the chimney while the rest of 
   them start a fire in the fireplace.&nbsp; She ends up a well-done 
   piece of meat. Another occupant is crucified on a cross, nails driven 
   through his hands. As all this is happening, poor pregnant Linda is 
   having visions about a baby, a virgin and a prophecy (it's all rather 
   confusing). In the finale, Ms. Blair becomes possessed (what else?) 
   and kills nearly all the remaining occupants, leaving Leslie Cumming 
   and the little boy the only survivors. In a coda that is telegraphed 
   early on, virginal Leslie Cumming finds out in the hospital that she 
   is pregnant. There's not much to recommend here except for some 
   pretty good atmosphere and a couple of good deaths (including 
   Hasselhoff's). The rest of the film just meanders along as everyone 
   walks around the hotel looking in rooms and Hildegard Kneff stares 
   into the camera while naming the three doors of death and what 
   happens in them. This one came fairly late in the Italian horror boon 
   of the 80's and you could tell that it was running out of steam. The 
   Italians were known for ripping-off U.S. films, so when they start 
   ripping-off their own you know it time to throw in the towel. <B><A HREF="witchery_1988c.htm">WITCHERY</A></B>

    BREW</A><A NAME="WitchsBrew2011"></A> (2011) -</B> Here's a fun, 
   gory little low-budget horror comedy film funded by the public 
   through internet financing site <A HREF="http://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</A>.
    If all publicly-funded horror films were this enjoyable, I would 
   gladly contribute to one, but I have seen my fair share of awful 
   publicly-funded films to make me think too hard and beg off, but if 
   the director of this film asked for money to make another film, I 
   would be happy to open my wallet. I wouldn't even ask to have my name 
   shown at the end credits (This film has the names of everyone who 
   contributed to the film and the list of names is a long one.). I 
   generally think that filmmakers should find their own way to make 
   films like the old days, but we live in a new technological age and 
   everyone has to keep up with it. Who am I to tell Joe Schmo not to 
   contribute to a film? If they have the money to spare, why not? Back 
   in the old days it was a tax write-off for doctors and other 
   professionals who helped fund a film, but today it's the thrill to 
   see your name on a film (and maybe get some swag in the process, 
   depending on how much you contribute). With that out of my system, 
   let's get to the film: It begins with pretty witch Dolores (Seregon 
   O'Dassey) concocting some kind of potion in a cauldron, when her 
   doorbell rings. It's a young boy who is going door-to-door selling 
   glasses of lemonade for $1.00 a glass. Dolores buys a glass, takes a 
   sip and spits it out is disgust. The boy pops out of the bushes and 
   yells, &quot;It's my piss, bitch!&quot; and then begins to burn some 
   ants with a magnifying glass. <A HREF="witchs_brew_2011.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/witch's brew dvd8a front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Suddenly,
    he is surrounded by a coven of witches, led by the older Brynn 
   (Helenmary Ball), where one witch actually bears big hairy moles on 
   her chin and nose! The boy's skin then breaks out in disgusting 
   pulsating boils (using good, old-fashioned bladder effects. There is 
   only one use of CGI in this entire film and it's no big deal) and his 
   hands catch fire, while the witches cackle as the opening credits 
   begin (music also by the director), where we see two young guys, Jeff 
   Drucker (Chris Magorian) and Preston Oakley (Gary-Kayi Fletcher) 
   making their own brand of beer in their micro-brewery, called 
   &quot;Slacker Lager&quot;. They sell their limited amount of beer to 
   local parties, liquor stores and bars, where the people love it. On 
   this day, the very superstitious Jeff breaks a mirror while trying to 
   turn off his alarm clock and when Preston and him drive to make their 
   beer deliveries, they accidentally hit a black cat crossing the road, 
   nearly severing it in half (nothing is hidden from the camera, 
   including the cat's innards spilled on the pavement). The cat has a 
   collar with an address on it, so a concerned Jeff makes Preston drive 
   to the address. It turns out to be the witches' house and the black 
   cat was actually a transformed Dolores, so an angry Brynn curses 
   their boxes of brew, telling them, &quot;If you drink that beer, 
   liver damage will be the least of your problems!&quot; Jeff takes the 
   curse seriously, because his cheating girlfriend Zoe (Megan Rippy) is 
   a practicing witch and runs a small store called &quot;The Witch Is 
   In&quot;, which sells voodoo dolls, candles and potions. Preston, on 
   the other hand, just laughs it off, and they drive to make their next 
   delivery, which is to the overweight Cosmo (Shawn C. Phillips; <B><A HREF="assault_of_the_sasquatch_2009.htm">ASSAULT
    OF THE SASQUATCH</A></B> - 2009; <B><A HREF="girls_gone_dead_2012.htm">GIRLS
    GONE DEAD</A></B> - 2012), who is having a big party at his house 
   that night. Meanwhile, the witches are in a big quandary, as they 
   need another witch to complete their coven before they perform an 
   important sacrificial ritual that night. If they don't perform the 
   ritual with a complete coven of 13 witches, the sacrifice won't work 
   and they will all die. Cosmo gives a bottle of beer to a 
   wheelchair-bound veteran and when he drinks it, his useless legs and 
   feet then kick him in the face until he is dead (Why has no one ever 
   thought of this before? Sure, it's in bad taste, but it is funny as 
   hell.). Our pair of brewers than sell a case to a liquor store, where 
   the owner drinks a bottle (he replaces the beer he drank from the 
   bottle with water so he can resell it!) and then gets and urgent 
   desire to run to the bathroom, where he shits out his intestines 
   through his ass and spits blood against the wall. Jeff is still 
   worried about the curse put on their brew, so they decide to test it 
   on the local drunk Bernie (Michael Breecher), where nothing happens, 
   so they bring him along with them while Jeff visits Zoe. Preston 
   doesn't believe in black magic, so Zoe makes a cloth voodoo doll with 
   his name on it and tells Preston to stick a pin in the doll's head. 
   Preston's nose immediately bleeds, but Preston says bloody noses are 
   common with people. When Jeff tells Zoe what happened with the cat 
   and where he took it, she immediately goes into a panic (she slams 
   the voodoo doll on the counter by the head and Preston's head 
   twitches!) and tells Preston to find all the beer and get rid of it, 
   while she and Jeff go to the witches' house to try and smooth things 
   over. The witches kidnap two teenage soccer girls for their sacrifice 
   that night (I guess they are virgins) and bring them home and tie 
   them up. Two skateboarding punks drink bottles of the brew and one 
   goes into the woods to take a leak, where vines entangle him, turning 
   him into a giant bush. The other skateboarder tags a wall with a 
   spray paint can, only for it to turn into a pentagram, as two big 
   demon hands grab him by the shoulders and drag him down to Hell. 
   Preston, who still doesn't believe in Black Magic, continues to make 
   the deliveries (with Bernie still in the back seat). The county 
   coroner, Frank (low-budget legend George Stover; <B><A HREF="blood_massacre_1988.htm">BLOOD
    MASSACRE</A></B> - 1988), is at the liquor store and when police 
   officer Rebecca Harrington (Kendra North) looks at the body and asks 
   him if it was murder, Frank says, &quot;Either that or it's the worst 
   case of the shits I have ever seen!&quot; He also warns police 
   officer Larry Primrose (Joe Ripple; The director of <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Harvesters">HARVESTERS</A></B> 
   [2001], <B><A HREF="stakes_2002.htm">STAKES</A></B> [2002], <B><A HREF="sealed_fates_2010.htm">SEALED
    FATES</A></B> [2010] and other SOV atrocities), who is always 
   picking his nose, not to throw his boogers on his crime scene. When 
   Zoe and Jeff arrive at the witches' house, Brynn lies about the 
   cursed beer and says it was all a joke, but she notices something 
   special about Zoe and invites her to join her &quot;nature 
   circle&quot;. Zoe accepts, gives Jeff the keys to her car and tells 
   him to go home. More horrendous deaths happen to people who drink the 
   brew, like a photographer's model who drinks a bottle in the bathroom 
   and watches as her face melts and her tits sag down to her stomach in 
   the mirror. The photographer enters the bathroom and can only see the 
   model from her back, so he decides to do her doggie style, only to 
   have his dick ripped-off (nothing is left to the imagination). Zoe 
   discovers the soccer girls tied-up in the house, but her head is on 
   the receiving end of a frying pan wielded by Brynn and she is 
   knocked-out. Jeff returns home and gives his verbally abusive father 
   the last bottle of brew he has (he now believes it was all a joke), 
   only to discover that after his father has drank the beer, his eyes 
   turn a glowing white and he tries to kill his son, but Jeff pushes 
   him down and his father is impaled by a fireplace poker. A patron at 
   a bar owned by Bruce Bartolli (Ryan Thomas (<B><A HREF="deadlands_2_trapped_2008.htm">DEADLANDS
    2: TRAPPED</A></B> - 2008; <B><A HREF="vhs2_2013.htm">V/H/S/2</A></B> 
   - 2013) drinks a bottle of the cursed brew and turns into a werewolf 
   (the werewolf's glowing eyes were the only digital effects in the 
   movie), chowing down on another patron who refused to share the bowl 
   of beer nuts with him a few minutes earlier. He traps Bruce in the 
   bathroom, Bruce only armed with an aluminum bat with the words 
   &quot;Hi Yo Silver&quot; written on the top of the bat. Zoe is 
   indoctrinated into the coven, while Jeff and Preston (who now 
   believes after seeing Jeff's father's dead body) try to retrieve all 
   the delivered brew. To say they are unsuccessful is an 
   understatement. A Frank Sinatra impersonator (Ron LaMartina, who I 
   believe is the director's father) sings to a crowd of people in a bar 
   who are already dead from drinking the brew. The impersonator drinks 
   a bottle of the brew and dissolves into a pile of green goo (or, as I 
   call it, &quot;Hoboken's Revenge&quot;). A drunk patron enters 
   Bruce's bar, only to have his face graphically slashed by the 
   werewolf. Jeff and Preston go to the places they delivered their beer 
   to, only to find gory deaths in their wake. Officers Jessica and 
   Larry are very busy investigating all the deaths in their town, while 
   Bruce shoves his baseball bat down the werewolf's throat, killing it 
   (Bruce says to Jeff and Preston, &quot;He was my best customer and he 
   tried to eat me!&quot;). The cops show up at the Sinatra Bar, only to 
   discover everyone dead and a burnt dismembered human hand on the bar 
   holding a bottle of Slacker Lager. Larry (who is still picking his 
   nose, digging in deep and mining for nose gold) pours some of the 
   Slacker Lager on a piece of wood in his patrol car and it turns into 
   a giant green booger that rips his face off (Oh, the irony!). Jeff, 
   Preston, Bruce and Brian head to Cosmo's party where, a short time 
   earlier, Cosmo was getting a personal dance from one of his female 
   guests in his bedroom. One of the party guys enters the bedroom and 
   sees Cosmo eating the innards of the girl, runs out to the party and 
   tells the rest of them, &quot;Cosmo is eating the girl he is 
   with!&quot;, to which one of the party boys says, &quot;All right 
   bro!&quot; A girl in the bathroom drinks a<A HREF="witchs_brew_2011.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/witch's brew poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   bottle of brew and her hair starts growing rapidly, wrapping itself 
   around her body, turning her into a hair mummy. Some of the guys play 
   beer pong and it turns serious when one of the ping pong balls turns 
   out to be an eye from one of the party guests playing the game. 
   Another party guest's nose grows like Pinocchio and then snaps off, 
   leaving a bloody hole on his face. By the time Frank the Coroner and 
   the police make it to Cosmo's house. it's a virtual bloodbath and 
   Cosmo has finished eating the girl, so he begins eating himself, 
   starting with his fingers. Frank sees a living girl at the party who 
   has no mouth and says, &quot;Let me get you a pen.&quot; Jeff 
   convinces police officer Rebecca to come with him, Preston, Bruce and 
   Brian to the witches' house to save Zoe and when they get there, 
   Rebecca finds a magnifying glass in the front yard that belongs to 
   her son (the same boy the witches killed in the beginning of the 
   film). The witches are in the back yard performing a ritual with the 
   two soccer girls tied up in the middle of their circle. Zoe has gone 
   to the dark side, as she twists the head on Preston's voodoo doll and 
   we see Preston's head do a 180&#176; turn. She then pulls and arm and 
   a leg off the doll and the same thing happens to Preston. He never 
   stood a chance. Zoe turns her attention to Jeff, but Bruce kills her 
   with his bat (Bruce tells Jeff, &quot;I think that you can do 
   better.&quot;). Rebecca shoots most of the other witches in the head 
   (Jeff says, &quot;Hey, one of them was my Guidance Counselor!&quot;), 
   but it takes a drunk Brian to kill Brynn, as he runs her over with 
   the car (&quot;Hey, anyone need a ride?&quot;). Zoe turns out to not 
   be quite so dead, so Jess slits her throat. The witch with the hairy 
   moles kills Bruce with an ivory horn, but Jess gets his revenge when 
   he pulls the horn from Bruce's body and impales the witch bitch on 
   the top of her head, just before she is about to kill Rebecca. Brian 
   (who was immune from the curse because he is never sober) says, 
   &quot;I need a drink!&quot; and the film ends.&nbsp; While this film 
   is nothing but a showcase for gory physical effects and part of the 
   story line may remind you of aspects of <B><A HREF="street_trash_1987.htm">STREET
    TRASH</A></B> (1987), one man auteur,

   - 2014, and others), keeps things moving at a quick pace and it will 
   remind you of those gore films from the 80's, which is a good thing. 
   There are also some terrific one-liners, especially by George Stover 
   in his two scenes, but everyone gets a chance to shine and the acting 
   is not bad at all. Sometimes, the film's low-budget roots show 
   through (such as Bruce's bar only having two customers and the cases 
   of brew have &quot;Slacker Lager&quot; written on them with black 
   magic marker), but this is an inventive horror comedy (gore effects 
   supplied by Kaleigh Browm and Jason M. Koch) that will keep your 
   attention from beginning to end. Now this is what Kickstarter is all 
   about! Low-budget vets George Stover (who worked with John Waters and 
   the late Don Dohler), fast-rising actor Shawn C. Phillips (who has 92 
   acting credits since 2008!) and the equally fast-rising Ryan Thomas 
   (who also cast this film) were all given Associate Producer credits. 
   Don't get me wrong, this film is nothing ground-breaking, but it is a 
   perfectly fine way to spend 87 minutes of your life. Filmed in the 
   Summer of 2010, but not released on DVD until 2012. I am happy that 
   physical effects are making a comeback in a very big way. It is music 
   to my ears. Filmed in Baltimore, Maryland. Also starring Lauren 
   Lakis, Virginia House, Troy Jennings, Josh Davidson, Ruby Larocca (<B><A HREF="faces_of_schlock_2009.htm">FACES

    2</B>, but it has very little in common with the first <A HREF="#Superstition1982"><B>SUPERSTITION</B></A> 
   (1982) besides a witch being involved. It's 1932 and the townsfolk in 
   Micanopy, Florida are up in arms that a witch (Deanna Lund) is living 
   among them. Being proper religious witch-fearing townsfolk and all, 
   they march to the witch's house bearing torches and weapons, stab the 
   witch in the leg with a pitchfork, brand her neck with a red-hot 
   poker and burn her alive as she is chained to a tree. Of course, in 
   true burning witch fashion, she puts a curse on all the townspeople 
   and their future family members. Watching this whole horrifying 
   spectacle from her bedroom window is the witch's young daughter 
   Rachel (Suzanne Law), whose blank stare could scare the shit out of a 
   blind man. Later that night, Rachel hears her mother's voice calling 
   her, so she breaks her attic bedroom window with her white ball and 
   jumps out the window, her fate unknown. Cut to Florida, September

    Carol (Michelle Vannucci), who just lost their parents six months 
   earlier, is heading from New York City to Micanopy, Florida to stay 
   in an old house Ed and Carol just learned they inherited. Anyone care 
   to guess who was the former occupant? They are all met at the bus 
   stop by Ed and Carol's cousin Simona (Nancie Sanderson), whom they 
   have never met before. She drives them forty minutes to the house, 
   which turns out to be in dire need of repairs. Everyone decides to 
   stay anyway and chip in to help with repairs. Carol's best friend 
   Susan (Amy Adams) has a run-in with Rachel and her white ball, but 
   when black friend Gloria (Charon Butler) shows up, little Rachel 
   disappears. After a dinner consisting of buckets of KFC, Coke and 
   cans of Budweiser (apparently paid sponsors) and an impromptu 
   striptease performed by a drunk Susan, the real action begins. Carol 
   feels drawn to Rachel's attic bedroom, but Simona (who has an 
   unhealthy interest in the occult, especially in &quot;alternate 
   dimensions&quot;) talks her out of it. Carol begins having nightmares 
   and wants to leave the house, but Ed wants to stay because he has the 
   hots for Simona (&quot;We're not blood cousins!&quot;). Simona, who 
   is sleeping in Rachel's attic bedroom, has a nightmare where she 
   brutally stabs both Ed and Carol to death and then begins to have 
   waking visions where she views the &quot;alternate dimension&quot;. 
   When an ex-priest, the insane Padre Matthew (Ian Bannen), learns that 
   the kids are staying in the house and tries his hardest to scare them 
   the hell outta there. A possessed Susan kills her boyfriend Mike 
   (Jeff Bankert) and then turns her attention towards Ed, while Gloria, 
   who is also possessed, hacks Paul (Jason M. Lefkowitz) to death with 
   a meat cleaver. Simona finds a secret passage and an important old 
   letter, but pays for it with her life. Can Carol and Ken (Christopher 
   Peacock) learn enough from the letter and a quite mad Padre Matthew 
   to stop Rachel and her mother's curse?&nbsp; Typical in every aspect

   possessed by spirits, a tarot card reading that ends badly and, since 
   this is an Italian horror film, gory deaths. Besides the meatcleaver 
   death, there is death by chainsaw (A ridiculous scene where a

   thrown out a window onto the hard concrete below; Susan being axed to

   is shocked, until the lights go out and then comes back on with 
   Cayenne alive and well. The audience eats it up, but it affects 
   Edmund in a totally different way. He begins having nightmares of 
   Cayenne (who is a stripper) dancing on-stage and spontaneously 
   eviscerating, her guts spilling all over the dance floor. Edmund goes 
   to Montag's show the next night, where stripper Cecelia (Amina 
   Munster) has bear traps thrown all over her body, the last one 
   decapitating her, but, just like the night before, when the lights 
   come back on, she is fine and dandy and all in one piece. Edmund 
   becomes obsessed with Montag, much to Maggie's disgust. Edmund's 
   nightmares become more and more bizarre and violent, and when Cayenne 
   and Cecelia end up dead in real life, both in the same manner of how 
   they &quot;died&quot; on Montag's stage, he begins to dig deeper. His 
   friend Jinky (Joshua Miller; <B><A HREF="rivers_edge_1986.htm">RIVER'S

   pathologist, tells Edmund that both dead girls had deadly toxins from

   discovers, so he brings Jinky to Montag's next show, where a girl is 
   roasted alive. Edmund follows the girl home, finds out that she has 
   no memory of performing in Montag's show and learns he may be 
   responsible for starting a fire that burns the girl alive for real. 
   Is it possible that Edmund is actually the murderer or are there far 
   more nefarious forces at play? When Jinky is Montag's next victim 
   on-stage (Montag shoves a broom handle covered in a towel down 
   Jinky's throat, removes the broom handle and then quickly pulls the 
   towel out of Jinky's throat, bringing his stomach and lungs up with 
   the towel!), Edmund begins to learn the truth about himself, Montag 
   and the string of murders. You can read all about it in Edmund's last 
   edition of The Cacaphony Gazette (it comes in various versions).&nbsp;

   everyone dresses like they live in the 40's, but carry such modern 
   conveniences as cell phones and the backgrounds glitch like they are 
   part of a buggy computer game. The normally manic Crispen Glover is 
   quite restrained here as Montag (maybe a little too restrained for 
   the film's own good), but the effects are very gory (although it's 
   obvious some of the bloodier effects do have CGI enhancement). The 
   script, by Zach Chassler, loses control about two thirds of the way 
   in, when it become apparent to the viewer that Edmund has more than 
   one loose screw in his head and the film becomes unhinged; becoming 
   nothing but a series of disjointed scenes that really don't make much 
   sense. While I applaud the filmmakers for not doing a straight-ahead 
   retread of H.G. Lewis' gore film and setting it in some dream 
   universe, I really can't recommend it because it doesn't add-up to 
   much more than the ramblings of an insane man's mind. Still, it's

   (1979) -</B> Shelby, North Carolina's favorite son, Earl Owensby, 
   tries his hand at gothic horror and the results are uneven, to say 
   the least. The film opens in 1910 with brother and sister Clement 
   (Richard Dedmon) and Elizabeth Glasgow (Maggie Lauterer) standing at 
   the deathbed of their Uncle Edwin (Julian Morton), when Reverend 
   Leonard (Edward Grady) pulls out a silver dagger and stabs Edwin in 
   the heart, killing him. All three seem pleased with the result and 
   then send for Edwin's son, Colin Glasgow (Owensby), to come to the 
   Glasgow Estate immediately to attend his father's funeral, but it's 
   clear that their intentions are much more nefarious. Colin arrives by 
   train and is greeted by family lawyer Ewan Rowe (Al Meyers) and they 
   take a horse-drawn carriage to the family mansion, where he is 
   greeted by Clement, Elizabeth and family butler Luther (Victor 
   Smith). That night, while Colin is sleeping, Clement, Elizabeth and 
   Reverend Leonard perform a satanic ritual where they transfer the 
   &quot;Glasgow Family Curse&quot; into Colin's body. Now I wonder what 
   that curse could be? After his father's funeral, Colin hooks-up with 
   old flame Lynn Harris Randolph (Kristina Reynolds), who is recently 
   divorced, and the romance is rekindled, much to the disma<A HREF="wolfman_1979.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/wolfman 1979 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="299" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>y
    of Lynn's father and most of the townspeople. Lynn explains to Colin 
   that since he's been away (he's a world traveler and made his fortune 
   in the import/export business), it's not safe to be outside at night 
   and there have been several unsolved murders. That night, Colin has a 
   bad nightmare where his father reaches up from his grave and grabs 
   him on his leg, but at the reading of his father's will, where it 
   states that the entire fortune will be left to him on the condition 
   he spends the next thirty days at the estate, Colin grows suspicious 
   and discovers that his father's signature on the will has been 
   forged, which is verified by family doctor and close friend, Dr. 
   George Tate (Sid Rancer), who tells Colin to talk to his grandmother 
   (Helene Tryon). Grandmother Glasgow tells Colin that his father and 
   grandfather were lycanthropes and that is why his father sent him 
   away years ago, to protect him from the curse. Grandma also warns 
   Colin that his cousins and Reverend Leonard are devil worshippers and 
   if he wants proof that his father was a werewolf, he should dig his 
   father's body up and &quot;look at his hands&quot;, because those 
   afflicted with werewolfism have index fingers bigger than the rest of 
   their fingers. That night, Colin digs-up his father's body and 
   discovers the truth (his father's index fingers could be used as 
   blackboard pointers!), but he is attacked by a real wolf while 
   examining the body. When he wakes up the following morning, he 
   discovers that all his wounds have healed and his father's grave 
   looks undisturbed. Colin tells everything to Dr. Tate, who believes 
   Colin has just had a bad nightmare. Colin decides to leave the estate 
   for good, but never makes it because it's a full moon tonight and 
   Colin turns into a werewolf, killing a husband and wife in the 
   bedroom of their home. Colin wakes up in the morning covered in 
   blood, brings Lynn to Dr. Tate's office and confesses to the murders, 
   so Colin agrees to be chained-up in a room in the estate's basement 
   to convince Lynn and Dr. Tate that he is, indeed, a werewolf. Well, 
   he does turn into a werewolf, breaks his chains and kills Luther, 
   Clement, Elizabeth and several torch-bearing townspeople before being 
   captured by the Sheriff (Owensby regular Brownlee Davis). Dr. Tate 
   and Lynn try to get Reverend Tate to reverse the curse, which sets 
   the stage for a final battle between the Reverend and werewolf Colin. 
   Both end up dead and the curse has finally ended.&nbsp; <B><A HREF="wolfman_1979d.htm">WOLFMAN</A></B>

   in the time lapse manner of the 1941 Lon Chaney Jr. version of <B><A HREF="wolf_man_1941.htm">THE

   while there are several gory scenes belying its PG-rating (Edwin's

   When their van hits a boulder in the middle of the road and becomes

   together the body parts of three of Mexico's best wrestlers in an 
   experiment sanctioned by the President of Mexico to bring home the 
   gold in the Olympics. It's not long before El Mascarado begins 
   killing the rest of the group, slaughtering them in various ways and

   it's not going to be all that easy. How can you unmask someone who 
   has never been defeated?&nbsp; Is this silly as hell? Sure it is. But

   wrestling action, you can't go wrong with this. <B><A HREF="wrestlemaniac_2006b.htm">WRESTLEMANIAC</A></B> 
   is a short (75 minutes), professionally made slasher flick that 
   delivers on the grue and doesn't waste much time getting right to the 
   exploitative elements. First-time director/screenwriter Jesse Baget 
   deserves some credit for not adhering to standard slasher elements 
   and playing fast and loose with audience expectations on which 
   members of the group are going to die first. The fact that group 
   leader Alphonse (Adam Huss) is the third to die attests to this fact. 
   His death is very hard to watch, as El Mascarado punctures his throat 
   with a door bolt, smashes his teeth and nose on the edge of a stone 
   step, tosses him around like a rag doll and then rips off his face in 
   a graveyard, all in graphic close-up. There is much to recommend 
   here, including El Mascarado's wrestling/killing room (where he keeps 
   all the detached faces of his previous victims hanging on a wall), 
   the over-the-top bloody effects (some of them are truly 
   cringe-worthy) and the acting abilities of the young cast, which also 
   includes WWE Diva Leyla Milani. Hell, this is nothing spectacular, 
   but it is a well-made slasher flick that achieves it's goals. It's 
   bloody as hell and quick moving. The pretty clever finale leaves this 
   wide-open for a sequel and the closing credits contain a funny on-set 
   rap performed by Jeremy Radin. Be aware that the Rey Misterio that 
   stars here is not the current WWE superstar, but his uncle. An <A HREF="http://www.anchorbayentertainment.com">Anchor

   carnage and black comedy moments (especially Amber, Jonesy and Jake 
   enjoying a &quot;barbecue&quot;, only to discover that they are 
   eating pieces of Kimberly or when Murphy gets all dolled-up like

   into Jonesy's eye, killing them both. The trick here is that director 
   Lynch portrays the cannibal clan as a loving family, who all eat 
   dinner together at the supper table and even say Grace before eating 
   their meal. If it weren't for their incestuous habits and their 
   hunger for human flesh (not to mention their mongoloid appearance),

   Chavez (Tamer Hassain) and other violent cons, including skinhead

   prisoner chained to Chavez, Willy (Christian Contreras), is actually 
   an undercover U.S. Marshal who believes that Chavez, with Floyd's 
   help, is planning an escape during the bus trip. Since Nate was born 
   and bred in the area, he takes the bus on the Old Mill Road to avoid 
   an escape attempt, but it puts them in prime cannibal country (Ah,

   Three Finger and his cannibal friend, Three Toe, begin slaughtering 
   the prisoners in various ways, as Chavez gets the upper hand and 
   makes Nate and a badly injured Walter his prisoners. With Nate as 
   their guide, the group head for safety and run into Alex, who warns 
   them about the cannibals (Not only is she a little late in that 
   department, she really should worry about Floyd, who wants her to 
   &quot;sit and spin&quot; on his lap!). The rest of the film is a 
   series of gory set pieces, as the prisoners find an abandoned armored 
   car full of money (and become greedy). Chavez shoots Walter in the 
   head and then cuts Three Toe's head off and impales it on a pole for 
   Three Finger to find. Willy is the next to die when he has his face 
   cut off by a scythe booby trap (Chavez and Floyd cut off Willy's legs 
   to free them from their leg shackles!). Will Nate and Alex escape, 
   since they not only have to worry about Three Finger, they also have 
   to deal with Chavez and Floyd's brutal tactics? Stay tuned, it's 
   about to get bloody.&nbsp; As a gore flick, <B>WRONG TURN 3</B> 
   delivers in spades, as limbs are hacked off, necks are sliced, booby 
   traps are triggered, brains are eaten, bodies are impaled and flesh 
   is devoured. Too bad director Declan O'Brien (who directed three Syfy

   (2017) -</B> In this DTV horror film, Rachel (Callie Ott) was the 
   &quot;final girl&quot; left alive after watching her friends being 
   slaughtered by some unknown madman three years ago. The killer was 
   never found. Rachel and her college friends want to decide what to do 
   for Spring Break and friend Jacob (Benjamin Norris - <B><A HREF="13_13_13_2013.htm">13/13/13</A></B> 
   - 2013) suggests they go to a refurbished cabin in the woods that his 
   Uncle fixed up , but never uses (He &quot;forgets &quot; to tell them 
   that his Uncle disappeared in the woods and was never found). To get 
   to the regular modern horror film conventions Jacob tells them there 
   is no cable, internet or cell phone service in the area, but there is 
   electricity, so the stupid girls decide to go anyway since the cabin 
   has a built-in pool. (Is there anything such as a &quot;second final 
   girl&quot;? I guess Laurie Strode could be consider one after 
   battling Michael Myers in <B><A HREF="halloween_1978.htm">HALLOWEEN</A></B> 
   [1978] and <B><A HREF="halloween_2_1981.htm">HALLOWEEN II</A></B> 
   [1981]) Actually, the entire film is one big flashback, as Rachel is 
   telling the story<A HREF="wtf_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/wtf poster12 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   of what happened at the cabin to two detectives in an interrogation 
   room.&nbsp; But you don't have to be a genius to figure out this 
   film's &quot;surprise reveal&quot; to figure out who the killer is. 
   On their way to the cabin, they stop at the last convenience store 
   before they hit the woods (name me one horror film of this type where 
   the same thing doesn't happen). An old man behind the counter warns 
   the kids not to go where they are heading and doesn't tell them why. 
   They all go anyway and ignore the old man's advice (Rachel leaves her 
   credit card behind which leads to the funniest scene in the film). 
   Most of the girls and guys on this trip are sex-crazed and once they 
   see the cabin and the pool (The inside of the cabin looks like it was 
   filmed in a normal house and what person in their right mind would 
   put a beautiful built-in pool in the middle of the woods? Think about 
   the problems.). Rachel's Paris Hilton-looking friend Bonnie (Andrea 
   Hunt; <B><A HREF="awaken_the_shadowman_2017.htm">AWAKEN THE SHADOWMAN</A></B> 
   - 2017) strips off her bikini and jumps into the pool which causes 
   all the guys and other girls (besides Rachel) to do the same thing 
   (Speaking of Paris Hilton, the despicable gossip-mongering, 
   wrecker-of-lives Perez Hilton [Real Name: Mario Lavandeira] puts in a 
   10 second cameo at a party at the beginning of the film where he has 
   a line and then pukes. He makes me puke! Let's just say as an actor, 
   he is a good puker.) Bevan (Adam Foster) has his throat cut while he 
   is playing video games and Rachel sees it. She runs to her friends to 
   tell them what she saw, but when they all come back, Bevan's body is 
   missing. It is at this time that Jacob tells everyone about his 
   missing Uncle; he supposedly died, but his body was never found. Sam 
   (Johnny James Fiore) is the next to be found dead after making love 
   to Lisa (Sarah Agor - <B><A HREF="hatchet_2_2010.htm">HATCHET II</A></B> 
   - 2010)). The killer cuts his ball's off and throws them on his dead 
   body. It should be noted that Sam is/was Rachel's boyfriend. Rachel 
   disappears and the Bonnie has her face burned off with an aerosol can 
   of hair spray and a lighter. We then watch Toby (Nick Reilly) kill 
   Lisa with an ax. Rachel reveals to Jacob that Toby is actually the 
   killer, but no one knows who Toby is. Rachel tells Jacob that she is 
   actually Toby, as we watch flashbacks (flashbacks within a 
   flashback?) of Rachael killing everyone, while she imagines she is 
   Toby, her non-existent brother. Rachel kills Jacob by slitting open 
   his stomach and pulling out his intestines. The film ends on that 
   note, with the male interrogating Detective calling her a &quot;crazy 
   fucking bitch&quot;. The closing credits play over pre-production 
   sketches showing how the cast will die and Rachel's eventual fate 
   and, believe me, it would have been a much better movie. Exposing 
   Rachel as the killer is a no-brainer. I literally mean you could be 
   born without a brain and still figure it out. Luckily, there is 
   plenty of female eye candy to go around in or out of their clothes. 
   As far as the special makeup effects go, only the killings of Bonnie 
   and Jacob register; all the other deaths are done in the dark and are 
   impossible to see. If this is 2017's idea of a horror film (it is 
   only 80 minutes long), we are all in trouble. 
   Director/co-screenwriter Peter Herro (His first feature film, 
   although like most new filmmakers today, he has directed plenty of 
   shorts) does absolutely nothing here to build suspense or create a 
   sense of terror. This is basic stalk and slash stuff, but without the 
   usual bloody kills (except for Jacob's). The screenplay (co-written 
   by Christopher Centanni &amp; Adam Buchalter) follows all the genre 
   conventions, but fails miseraably at making us understand why no one 
   suspects Rachel when she went through the same thing three years 
   earlier. It would take a psychiatrist five minutes to diagnose 
   Rachel's multiple personality disorder, yet the rest of the cast 
   don't even care. And that is why this film burns and crashes with the 
   viewer, Ignore all the positive reviews on IMDb, because it is 
   apparent they were written by someone who worked on the film. A <A HREF="http://midnightreleasing.com">Midnight

   underground blasting and accidently uncover a tomb which contains 
   Dracula's decendents. A soldier is posted at the site for the night 
   when a tremor shakes loose two coffins. The soldier pulls the stake

   puts the bite on the soldier and then opens the other coffin. The dog 
   pulls the stake out of the corpse and it turns out to be Veidt Smith 
   (the unmistakable Reggie Nalder, &quot;Albino&quot; in <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#MarkOfTheDevil1970">MARK
    OF THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1970), a &quot;half vampire&quot; who can 
   walk in daylight. He searches for the last remaining decendent of 
   Dracula, a family man in California named Michael Drake (Michael 
   Pataki, who played a bloodsucker in <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Grave Vampire">GRAVE
    OF THE VAMPIRE</A></B> - 1972), in hopes of turning him into a 
   vampire. Veidt takes a ship to L.A. with Zoltan and his coffin in a 
   crate. Not far behind Veidt is Inspector Branco (Jose Ferrer), a cop 
   from the Old Country who is out to stop Veidt and the vampire canine. 
   Drake, his wife, two kids and two dogs with a &quot;litter of 
   puppies&quot; (actually two) go on a camping trip in their RV and are 
   soon set upon by Zoltan and Veidt. Zoltan first bites one of the 
   puppies, which Drake and his kids find dead and bury it. Zoltan then 
   bites the two adult dogs and a hound dog owned by a <A HREF="draculas_dog_1977.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/dracula's dog  poster small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="112" HEIGHT="174" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>couple
    of hunters camped out nearby. Zoltan then attacks a hiker, tearing 
   him apart limb from limb. Zoltan then attacks Drake but the cricifix 
   on his neck drives the vampire dog away. Inspector Branco arrives on 
   the scene and explains what is happening to Drake. Drake sends his 
   wife, kids and remaining puppy away and, with the help of Inspector 
   Branco, defeats Veidt (stake through the heart) and Zoltan (falls off 
   a cliff onto a picket fence!). The finale is a real laugh riot as the 
   puppy that was bitten is seen chewing on a decapitated rabbit, 
   bearing it's bloody infant fangs and glowing eyes for the camera. 
   Where to begin? First, it's hard to say which is worse: The incessant 
   close-ups of Reggie Nalder's face or the frequent shots of Zoltan's 
   bloody fangs with dubbed in howling and growling noises. Both are 
   equally cringe-inducing and rib-tickling. The best part is when the 
   dogs are bitten. It's obviously a dog puppet biting their necks but 
   that's not the funniest part. After they are bitten, they all turn a 
   sickly gray color! There's also a really funny vampire dog attack at 
   a shack where Drake and Branco are hiding out, where the pack destroy 
   the shack and Zoltan chews through the roof! Another funny scene is 
   where Drake outruns the vampire canine pack and locks himself in a 
   convertible! That should keep them out. You have to look at this film 
   as camp to fully appreciate it otherwise you'll just be shaking your 
   head in disbelief. I enjoyed it for all the obvious wrong reasons. At 
   least I liked it. Written by Frank Ray Perilli, who is also

    with this film, I'll give you a little plot synopsis. A boat sails 
   into New York Harbor, seemingly devoid of passengers. The harbor 
   patrol boards the boat and one guy gets a hefty part of his neck 
   bitten off by an overweight zombie. The zombie is dispatched by 
   gunfire and falls into the water. The dead harbor patrol officer is 
   taken in for an autopsy. A girl (Tisa Farrow) , who is the daughter 
   of the man who owned the boat, and a newspaper reporter (Ian 
   McCulloch) go to an island in the Caribbean where her father was last 
   seen alive, to solve the mystery. It seems that the island is cursed 
   and the dead are coming back to life. A doctor on the island (Richard 
   Johnson) knows how to stop this plague; shoot 'em in the head. (Sound 
   familiar?) It's not long before the island is full of the walking 
   dead and everyone that is alive is fighting for their lives. Only Ms. 
   Farrow and Mr. McCulloch come out alive and they lock a zombie on 
   board their boat as proof as they sail back to New York. Too late, as 
   New York is full of the walking dead, started by the bitten harbor 
   patrol cop. This film is a notch above the rest of the Italian zombie 
   pics. The photography is sharp, the make-up and gore effects are 
   quite convincing (and graphic!), and the acting is above par this 
   time around. Many critics blasted late director Lucio Fulci for 
   &quot;borrowing&quot; other directors' ideas and styles. Maybe he 
   did, but he had his own style which was quite unique and stood 
   out.&nbsp; One scene is so outstanding, I doubt I'll ever forget it. 
   It takes place after our hero crashes the jeep and the survivors have 
   to flee on foot through the jungle to escape from the zombies. They 
   stumble upon an ancient burial ground of Spanish Conquistadors, which 
   proceed to rise from the grave. It's all very creepy and atmospheric. 
   One zombie even rises from the standing position! Let's also not 
   forget the scene of the wood shard going through an eyeball. I still 
   squirm when that scene comes up. This is one of those films that I 
   could watch over and over without ever growing tired of it. The blood 
   doesn't begin to flow until half the movie has passed, but it is 
   never boring. As close a tribute to George Romero as you can get, 
   with a lot of originality thrown in (even the &quot;zombie vs. 
   shark&quot; sequence was used in part of a TV commercial!). <B><A HREF="zombie_1979c.htm">ZOMBIE</A></B>,

    A soldier returns home to Louisiana from the Vietnam War to discover 
   his wife has shacked-up with another man. He finds the man sleeping 
   next to his wife in his bed, pulls out his Army knife and slices the 
   man's throat while he is sleeping. When his wife wakes up and 
   discovers what he has done, she tries to run away, but he also slices 
   her throat. He then kills his wife's parents, who are holding a baby 
   (he kills the father by throwing the knife dead-center into his 
   forehead and cuts the mother's throat). He does not kill the baby, 
   though, and good thing, because the baby is his, which he never knew. 
   The soldier is also a bird lover (his house is full of caged and 
   uncaged birds of every type) and, in a case of very bad luck, the 
   soldier has his eyes pecked out by his own birds (I guess they didn't 
   like him going off to war!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Years pass, as we are then introduced to a group of college students 
   who are going on an expedition to locatethe ivory-billed woodpecker, 
   a species of bird that is about to go extinct. The college students, 
   Anne (Lara Wendel), Steve (Timothy W. Watts), Mary (Leslie Cummins), 
   Paul (James Villemaire), Jennifer (Lin Gathright), Rob (James 
   Sutterfield) &amp; Brian (Sal Maggiore Jr.), go to the isolated house 
   of Dr. Fred Brown (Robert Vaughn) since he was the last personto 
   &quot;see&quot; the said near-extinct woodpecker. They soon discover 
   that Dr. brown is blind as a bat (His eye sockets are hideously&nbsp; 
   mangled and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that he is 
   the murderous soldier). It seems that Dr. Brown can identify any 
   species of bird by the sound it makes, but when he hands Steven some 
   mysterious papers, it makes us wonder what he is really up to (Steven 
   takes the papers and refuses to tell Anne, who is also a reporter, 
   what is in them, but it doesn't take a genius to come up with the answer).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The group continue on their quest (lots of stock footage of birds 
   flying; many species which cannot be found in this area of the U.S.!) 
   and they come upon a rusted pickup truck (which we saw was not rusted 
   in the film's opening), which contains the body of a rotting corpse. 
   Rather than going to the police, the group continues on their trek 
   and come upon the soldier's abandoned house. It is full of empty, 
   rusted bird cages and they decide to stay there for the night. Steve 
   then begins having visions, where the house is like brand new. The 
   rusted bird cages are now bright and shiny and full of birds. He also 
   sees that one of the bedrooms has bloody sheets and the adjoining 
   bathroom sink is full of blood. Steve also imagines that Dr. Brown is 
   in the house, a female zombie is calling his name and Jennifer is 
   cricified to a wall, her hands impaled with railroad spikes. it 
   doesn't take a genius to know that these aren't visions at all. They 
   are memories from Steve's infancy.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    It's not long before the college kids are being picked-off 
   one-by-one. Jennifer has her head bashed-in when a zombie grabs her 
   hair and slams her noggin into a wall over and over. Could her death 
   have something to do with a newspaper she found that was dated March 
   29, 1965 (the date Steven was born)? Brian is the next to die when he 
   is set on fire and runs into the woods (Remember: Only you can 
   prevent forest fires!). The group decide to leave when Mary discovers 
   Jennifer's bloody body and their van suddenly appears at the house. 
   Rob tries to hotwire the van (Brian had the keys) as zombies 
   approach. Mary is killed when she is pulled out of the van's back 
   window and the skin on her neck stretches until it snaps, like cheese 
   on a pizza (the film's grossest, but not bloodiest, effect). They all 
   run back into the house when escape is impossible.&nbsp; Rob is 
   killed when his necklace gets caught in the spinning gears of a 
   generator and it nearly decapitates him (He does lose two fingers to 
   the gears when he tries to free himself).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Their laptop computer (one of those old bricks shaped like a 
   suitcase) suddenly says on screen &quot;Welcome Home, Steve&quot; and 
   the group are puzzled (this was before wi-fi). A zombie attacks Anne 
   &amp; Steve, but they get away and hide in the attic with Paul. Paul 
   doesn't fare too well when a zombie grabs his head and pulls him 
   through a hole in the roof (an effect that was previously done in Joe

    This is a slow and unremarkable Italian horror film, directed by 
   Claudio Lattanzi, using the pseudonym &quot;Claude Milliken&quot;, 
   his only directorial effort (He was First Assistant Director on films 
   such as Michele Soavi's <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Stage Fright">STAGEFRIGHT</A></B>

   [1987]. It was a good year for him!). Some sources list Joe D'Amato 
   as an uncredited director (He was the producer of this film). I don't 
   know whether that is true, but it would explain the attic death. The

   - 1988), makes very little sense (How does a decades-old unused 
   generator suddenly start with one pull? How does the blind Dr. Brown 
   arrive at his old home, which is miles away from his new home?) and 
   the surprise &quot;reveals&quot; are telegraphed very early on. But 
   it is the awful acting which sinks this film. It's not surprising 
   that many of the &quot;actors&quot; who appear as the college kids 
   never went on to do anything else, especially Timothy W. Watts as 
   Steve. His emoting is laughable as he tries to act while speaking in 
   monotone, even when he is scared. It is obvious that Robert Vaughn 
   was only hired for a couple of days shooting as his screen time is 
   minimal. Vaughn has made some stinkers in his life (try watching <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Lucifer Complex">THE

   praise for Roger Corman. He talks about his early appearance in 
   Corman's <B><A HREF="teenage_caveman_1958.htm">TEENAGE CAVE MAN</A></B>

    two punks try to rape a black girl, family man Bill Washington (John 
   Fasano) steps in to break it up and gets stabbed to death in front of 
   his wife and young son Tony. Years pass and Tony (Jon Mikl Thor) is a 
   devoted muscleheaded mama's boy and health food nut. He foils a 
   robbery at the neighborhood grocery store, only to get run over and 
   killed by five drunk punks in a car. Tony's mother has Molly Mokembe

   rises from his coffin, grabs his favorite baseball bat and gets down

    (Frank Dietz) is assigned to the case and hasn't got a clue where to 
   begin, which doesn't please Capt. Churchman (Adam West), who seems to 
   have more invested in this case than he's letting on. Tony then 
   impales the next guy with his bat while he is raping a girl in an 
   alley (When the coroner sees the guy with the baseball bat sticking 
   out of his stomach, he says, &quot;Christ on a crutch, Frank!&quot;). 
   The last two gang members, Bob (Allan Fisher) and Amy (Tia Carrere, 
   in a really bad career choice), decide to stick together, while we 
   learn that Churchman was one of the two punks involved in Tony's 
   death. Tony kills Bob by smashing his head against a car and crushes 
   Amy's head against a window. Frank is close behind and chases Tony 
   back to his final resting place (his work is done). Churchman kidnaps 
   Molly and brings her to the graveyard. He shoots Tony in the back and 
   then shoots Molly in the chest. He's about to shoot Frank when Tony's 
   father rises from his grave and drags Churchman down to the pits of 
   Hell. Everyone is avenged at last.&nbsp; It's hard to describe in

   snail's pace, you'll swear the hands on your watch are moving 
   backwards. I'm still trying to figure out how Churchman becomes 
   captain of the police force in the town where he murdered Tony's 
   father years earlier. Surely Tony's mother recognizes him, right? My 
   brain hurts. Whoever told musician Jon Mikl Thor (<B><A HREF="rock_n_roll_nightmare_1987.htm">ROCK

   for impersonating a talent agent. Thor makes the most unconvincing 
   zombie you'll ever see as he lumbers along like one of those 
   musclemen who exercise too much and can't walk normally (imagine if

   WOMEN'S HELL</A></B> (2006), is supposed to be the best (and

   left off: the rescue of sole survivor Sharon (Yvette Yzon), who, 
   after waking up in a hospital (where she has nightmares of turning 
   into a zombie and munching on a nurse), relates a story about an 
   uncharted island that contains hordes of the living dead to the 
   unbelieving insurance representatives of the sunken salvage ship The 
   Dark Star, of which Sharon was a crew member before it exploded after 
   a zombie attack. No one believes her story and six months pass before 
   she is contacted by Paul Barker (Paul Holme), a drug company 
   representative, who wants her to join a rescue team to<A HREF="zombies_the_beginning_2007.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/zombies the beginning poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="203" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   investigate the disappearance of a crew of scientists sent to the 
   island several weeks earlier to bring back some zombies for further 
   study, in hopes of creating new drugs to prolong life. A now-Buddhist 
   Sharon eventually agrees (she's got nothing to lose, since she's 
   still haunted by nightmares and unemployable in the outside world) 
   and joins a small group of heavily armed mercenaries as they head to 
   the island in a submarine (cue the stock footage!). Once on the 
   island, Sgt. Zamura (Robert B. Johnson), the leader of the mercs, 
   discovers that the missing scientists' base of operations is 
   deserted, but fully operational. The mercs find a warehouse full of 
   eaten body parts and then a laboratory lined with cages containing 
   zombies and aborted baby zombie fetuses. What kind of experiments 
   were the scientists performing? It's not long before everyone on the 
   island will find out the answer and the mercs' numbers begin to 
   dwindle, thanks to attacks by zombie babies (actually Filipino 
   dwarves in disguise!) and a swarm of mutated zombies. While Barker, 
   Sharon and Capt. Jurgens (James Paolleli; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Stranglehold1994">STRANGLEHOLD</A></B> 
   - 1994) monitor the situation from the Control Room, it becomes quite 
   obvious that Barker knows more about this situation than he letting 
   on, as more mercs become zombie chow and Sharon pulls a Ripley, 
   commandeers a vehicle and tries to rescue them. The remainder of the 
   film details Sharon's battles against the zombies and the eventual 
   uncovering of Barker's true reasons for wanting to come to the 
   island. Sharon makes a shocking discovery in the bowels of the base 
   (a queen zombie spitting out babies like Pez and a giant brain 
   controlling it all!) and uses her trusty flame-thrower to destroy it 
   all.&nbsp; This zombie flick is a not-so-thinly veiled rip-off of 
   James Cameron's <B><A HREF="aliens_1986.htm">ALIENS</A></B> (1986), 
   substituting zombies for aliens. Many of the sequences are copied 
   verbatim, including the birth of a baby zombie clearly patterned on 
   the baby aliens bursting from the stomachs of their human hosts and 
   the character of Barker representing Paul Reiser's corrupt 
   representative Burke in <B>ALIENS</B>. Barker even locks Sharon in a 
   lab with a bunch of hungry zombies, mimicking the scene of Ripley 
   locked in the lab with a face-hugger. If you can ignore all the 
   similarities (and that's a big if, because a drinking game can be 
   played spotting the <B>ALIENS</B> homages and you'd be smashed after 
   the first twenty minutes), the bad acting, the horrendous English 
   dubbing and dialogue (Typical exchange between two mercenaries: <B>#1:</B> 
   &quot;Now we're in deep shit!&quot; <B>#2:</B> &quot;Shut your 
   fucking mouth!&quot;), you may find yourself enjoying all the 
   decently-done gore, which includes gut-munching, a body being torn in 
   half, appendages being yanked-off, decapitations and exploding heads. 
   This is by no means a good film, but it is probably Bruno Mattei's 
   best in the crop of films he directed in the new millennium. I know 
   that's not saying much, but that's all we have now that Mattei 
   shuffled off to the Great Beyond shortly after finishing this 
   (There's a short tribute to the frail-looking Mattei during the 
   closing credits). Filipino staple Jim Gaines (also the Production 
   Coordinator here) puts in a cameo as a giant zombie. Also starring 
   Diana Croyston, Mike Vergel and Gerald Acho. While this has yet to 
   find an American distributor as of this writing (I'm sure it will 
   sooner or later if 20th Century Fox doesn't sue producer/co-scripter 
   Gianni Paolucci for plagiarism), it can easily be obtained on the

   (1990). Some day, there will be a detailed account (whether it be a 
   book or magazine article) on Prior's interesting life (he was one of 
   the co-founders of Action International Pictures [the 
   &quot;other&quot; A.I.P.], which littered video shelves with every 
   type of cheap genre film from the mid-80's to the early-90's), but it 
   is nice to see that he is still swinging for the fences with this 
   truly crappy (but strangely watchable) combination of action and 
   zombie genres. Fifty years ago, some unknown phenomenon caused 
   millions of dead people to rise from their graves and begin feasting 
   on the living (like most modern zombie films, these are <A HREF="zombie_wars_2007.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/zombie wars poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="207" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>fast-moving
    undead, not shuffling, slow-as-molasses zombies). Unlike most 
   zombies of yore, these are not your typical mindless undead; they are 
   organized and raise humans from infancy to be used as banquets at a 
   later date. The film opens with two brothers, David (Adam Stuart) and 
   Brian (Jim Marlow), saving a bunch of women being led by a group of 
   zombies to one of their base camps. David and Brian dispatch the 
   zombies, either by shooting them in the head or by machete 
   decapitation and are quick with a witty quip after each killing 
   (David rips one zombie's arm off and says to his brother, &quot;Need 
   a hand?&quot; Now that's quality screenwriting!). David and Brian 
   belong to a small military group led by The General (Kristi Renee 
   Pearce) and their job is to free as many human slaves as they can, 
   re-educate them (many of the human slaves have been raised by the 
   zombies since birth and have never heard English before) and teach 
   them how to fight. David falls for Star (Alissa Koenig), one of the 
   women he and Brian just saved, and when their camp is overrun by 
   zombies (plenty of gut-munching on display here), David and Star 
   become separated from their party and are captured by the zombies. 
   They are brought to &quot;The Farm&quot;, where the zombies (who 
   actually have a political hierarchy) mate humans for food and David 
   learns quickly not to talk in front of the zombies (another captive 
   soldier who does speak is eaten alive). David meets Sliver (Jonathan 
   Badeen), a soldier that has been at The Farm for five years (and 
   hasn't spoken a word of English since his capture) and they come up 
   with a plan for escape, but David doesn't fully trust Sliver (and for 
   good reason). It is revealed that Sliver is working for a human 
   council that is in collusion with the zombies for reasons not yet 
   made clear. While The General and Brian (who are falling in love) 
   search for David, they come up against a group of zombies carrying 
   crates full of tin cans containing fresh vegetables and meat. Since 
   it is clear that this is not for zombie consumption (whoever heard of 
   a zombie vegetarian?) and all the tin cans are brand new, the 
   questions soon become: Who is supplying this to the zombies and why? 
   You would have to be as brain-dead as a 300 year-old zombie not to 
   figure it out. Sliver turns good guy and defies the council's orders 
   (they want him to kill David) and he spills everything he knows to 
   David. With David and Sliver working from the inside and Brian and 
   The General working from the outside, the zombies and their human 
   allies don't stand a chance.&nbsp; While the gore comes at a fast and 
   furious pace and the acting at least tries to be earnest (although 
   Jonathan Badeen seems to have learned his craft by watching too much 
   Jack Nicholson), director/screenwriter/co-producer David A. Prior 
   can't seem to make up his mind whether he wants to make a horror film 
   or an action film. While that would not normally be a problem (the 
   remake of <B><A HREF="dawn_of_the_dead_2004.htm">DAWN OF THE DEAD</A></B> 
   [2004] did it with much gusto), Prior's screenplay is unsure or more 
   to the point, insecure, about where it stands. There are many 
   &quot;What The Fuck?!?&quot; sequences on view, such as human zombie 
   ally George (Billy Hayes, who also plays the &quot;Zombie King&quot;) 
   painting his house red, while bitching and moaning to his tied-up 
   zombie parents; David suffering the same fate as the hero in the 
   original <B><A HREF="night_of_the_living_dead_1968.htm">NIGHT OF THE 
   LIVING DEAD</A></B> (1968); or The General playing a very unfunny 
   practical joke on Brian, you'll be wondering what Prior was smoking 
   when he wrote the script. Prior shot <B>ZOMBIE WARS</B> (also known 
   as <B><A HREF="war_of_the_living_dead_2007.htm">WAR OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B>)
    on HD Digital Video, so it looks crisp and colorful, especially the too-numerous-to-count
    gunshots to the head, gut-munching, neck-biting, decapitations (the 
   only obvious use of CGI in the film) and the weirdly effective zombie 
   makeups. Worth a viewing just for all the wrongheaded twists and 
   turns. Also starring Loretta Norton, James Warnock, Danielle Jacobs, 
   Steven Stewart and Anthony Contreras. An American World Pictures DVD 
   Release. <B>Not Rated</B>. <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">UPDATE:</FONT></B>
