    <BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>SAXON - 
    Independent thinker and retired film producer Bill Rebane is 
    returning his attention to state politics and has declared his 
    candidacy for governor.</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Rebane 
    previously ran for the position in 1979.&nbsp;</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Rebane said the 
    biggest reason he is running is that he feels many of today's 
    politicians are not adequately representing their constituents.</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>&quot;My 
    campaign platform is that I am a non-politician,&quot; Rebane said. 
    &quot;Politicians are out of touch with reality. Unless he is a real 
    statesman, it doesn't take a professional politician to represent people.&quot;</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Rebane said he 
    has special interests in education, small business and increasing the 
    ability of counties and communities to govern themselves.</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Rebane operated 
    the Shooting Ranch Motion Picture Studios in Gleason for almost 30 
    years ending in 1988. For part of that time, Rebane said he had the 
    only full-time feature film studio in the Midwest. He also said he 
    was instrumental in creating the Wisconsin Film Office in the late 
    70's. he said some of the skills he gained from these experiences 
    would translate directly to the governor's office.</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>&quot;I'm a 
    business man,&quot; Rebane explained. &quot;I built an industry 
    unlike any other in Wisconsin, and I was very successful in managing 
    my business and the many people involved in it. In many ways, the 
    position of governor is not very different than that of a 
    corporation's chief executive officer. My career demanded a great 
    deal of skill in communicating, diplomacy, tact and manners&quot;</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Rebane said his 
    first job on the campaign trail is to research some issues so he can 
    discuss them at a higher level and help inform people.</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>&quot;Do you 
    know why the state is running a deficit?&quot; he asked. &quot;Neither
     do I. I think there are a very few people in the state understand 
    the deficit. We need to know about these things; that should be part 
    of a politician's job.&quot;</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Rebane said he 
    supports efforts to reform public school curriculum to better match 
    the findings of cognitive development specialists.</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>&quot;It's a 
    proven fact that of you want to teach a child something, you start 
    them young,&quot; he said. &quot;If you want them to speak and read 
    several languages, you start in grade school not in high school. You 
    don't teach your kids French or Spanish or Russian in high school, 
    you have to start them at an earlier age.&quot;</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Rebane also 
    said he thinks that colleges should include more practical forms of 
    education in their curricula.</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>&quot;If you 
    took the graduating classes from Yale and Harvard and any of those 
    students had to attend a formal state dinner, they'd be unable to 
    function because they wouldn't know which is the salad fork and which 
    is the meat fork,&quot; he said with a smile. &quot;It seems like 
    technical colleges do more for students than four year schools.&quot;</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Rebane also 
    said it's necessary for Americans to &quot;return to family 
    values&quot; and have parents involved in their children's' lives by 
    setting limits and providing support.</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>In addition to 
    domestic opportunities for education, he said America needs to work 
    to educate people around the world.</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>&quot;We're not 
    going to solve the problems of the world, like overpopulation, by 
    sending rubbers to Africa, but through education,&quot; he said. 
    &quot;We have to help the people there become civilized and 
    understand why they shouldn't have nine children when they can't 
    afford them. It goes back to logic and common sense.&quot;</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Rebane said he 
    is a staunch supporter of the American entrepreneurial spirit.&nbsp;</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>&quot;Small 
    business is this country's foundation, but it's in danger&quot; he 
    said. &quot;I really have a problem with people going to big chains 
    to buy things made in China and neglecting smaller merchants right 
    there on Main Street selling American wares.&quot;</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Rebane said he 
    would work to reduce the amount of paperwork facing small business 
    owners and try to make it easier for them to access state resources 
    such as grants.</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>&quot;It's 
    always the business community using its creative mind to get 
    something done,&quot; he said. &quot;The government and 
    representatives lack the creativity and innovative thinking needed to 
    find better ways to solve problems.&quot;</B></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Rebane said he

   early 90s. People were amazed by her penchant for pointing the camera

   She did this to cover the fact that she filmed these films silent and 
   avoided showing lip movement so she didn't have to match it in the

   while that may have been true, her films were one of a kind. They 
   were not meant to be viewed alone but rather with an alcohol or

   said Goddard was in the midst of a divorce and his estranged wife, 
   Ruthann, was in San Francisco during the weekend. The couple has two 
   young sons. Born in Perth, Australia, Goddard's work as a 
   professional boxer led to an acting role in a beer commercial. From

    Sidaris, the director/producer/screenwriter of a string of sexy spy 
   thriller passed away of throat cancer at the age of 76. Born in 
   Chicago, Illinois, he was best known for his &quot;Bullets, Bombs, 
   and Babes&quot; series of B-movies produced between 1985 and 1998. 
   These films featured a rotating &quot;stock company&quot; of actors 
   mostly made up of Playboy Playmates and Penthouse Pets including 
   Julie Strain, Dona Speir, Hope Marie Carlton, Cynthia Brimhall, 
   Roberta Vasquez, Julie K. Smith, Shae Marks and Wendy Hamilton. 
   Sidaris pioneered what he called the &quot;honey shot&quot;, 
   close-ups of cheerleaders and pretty girls in the stands at sporting 
   events. He won an Emmy Award in 1969 for directing the Summer Olympics.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">Before
    the B-movies, Sidaris was a pioneer in sports television. He 
   directed coverage of hundreds of football and basketball games, 
   Olympic events, and special programs and won seven Emmy awards for 
   his work in the field. His best known work was with ABC's Wide World 
   of Sports; he was the show's first director, and continued in that 
   post for 25 years. Sidaris branched out to dramatic television in the 
   1970s, directing episodes of programs like <B>GEMINI MAN</B> (1976), <B><A HREF="kojak_70s_tv_series.htm">KOJAK</A></B> 
   (mid-1970s), <B>THE HARDY BOYS/NANCY DREW MYSTERIES</B> (late-1970s)

    EXPRESS</A></B> and <B><A HREF="andy_sidaris_films.htm">DO OR DIE</A></B>.
    Most of Sidaris' &quot;Triple B&quot; series (later given the title 
   L.E.T.H.A.L. Ladies) focused on the adventures of a team of secret 
   agents and were mostly filmed in Hawaii. Several entries in the 
   series were only produced by him and were written and directed by 
   others. Although the series featured recurring characters, continuity 
   between films was not a priority and it was common for an actress who 
   played a villain (and was killed off) in one film to re-appear in a 
   subsequent film as a hero. With his wife as his production partner, 
   he made 12 films. His son, Christian Drew Sidaris, took over the 
   directorial reins on two of the L.E.T.H.A.L Ladies films: <B><A HREF="andy_sidaris_films.htm">ENEMY

    producer Peter Simpson, maker of some 40 Canadian-financed movies 
   and TV shows including <B>THE ELEVENTH HOUR</B> and the <B>PROM NIGHT</B> 
   franchise, died Tuesday in a Toronto hospital from complications due 
   to lung cancer. He was 64. Known as much for his outspoken manner as 
   his lengthy list of credits, the Scottish-born former adman produced 
   his first film in 1978, <B>THE SEA GYPSIES</B>, before moving on to 
   his 1980 breakthrough <B><A HREF="prom_night_1980.htm">PROM NIGHT</A></B>.
    The teen horror, which featured Leslie Nielsen and Jamie Lee Curtis, 
   was a hit and led to a string of genre movies through the '80s and 
   '90s, including <B><A HREF="curtains_1983.htm">CURTAINS</A></B> 
   (1982), the actioners<B> <A HREF="action.htm#No Contest">NO CONTEST</A></B> 
   (1994), <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#The Rage">THE RAGE</A></B> 
   (1996) and <B><A HREF="prom_night_3_the_last_kiss.htm">PROM NIGHT 
   III: THE LAST KISS</A></B> (1990), his sole effort as a director. In 
   1997, he cofounded Norstar Filmed Entertainment and went on to 
   produce notable titles including the World War I drama <B>REGENERATION</B> 
   (1997) and the Gemini Award-winning <B>THE ELEVENTH HOUR</B> (2002). 
   &quot;He was a one-of-a-kind guy, passionate about the industry, 
   passionate about everything he invested himself in. That was part of 
   his charm,&quot; says longtime friend and colleague Milt Avruskin. 
   &quot;When you got beneath that, there beat a heart of gold.&quot; 
   Upon accepting a special Genie Award in 2004 for his contributions to 
   the industry, Simpson spoke out against Telefilm Canada for a secret 
   and controversial deal it had struck with Creative Artists Agency, in 
   which the Hollywood outfit was to recruit Canuck actors based in L.A. 
   to appear in Canadian productions, in return for a packaging fee. 
   &quot;I hope Stursberg doesn't [expect] to get his phone calls 
   answered at that price,&quot; Simpson quipped, referring to Telefim's 
   then-boss Richard Stursberg. Simpson courted controversy again in 
   2005 when he represented <B><A HREF="karla_2005.htm">KARLA</A></B>, 
   the U.S.-made biopic of serial killer Karla Homolka, to Canadian 
   distributors, eventually striking a deal with Christal Films. His 
   most recent credits include the supernatural thriller <B><A HREF="marsh_2006.htm">THE
    MARSH</A></B>, starring Forest Whitaker, and the forthcoming CTV 
   mini <B>WOULD BE KINGS</B>, on which he executive produced alongside 
   his wife, Ilana Frank.</FONT></FONT><BR>

     ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN [1958] and ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES 
     [1959]) mummified body wasn't discovered until April 27, 2011, when a 
     neighbor noticed mail yellowing in her mailbox and cobwebs on the 
     front door of her home. Initial autopsy results say she may have been 
     dead up to a year! This just screams out so many questions, the main 
     one being: How does a mailman not notice mail piling up in a mailbox? 
     A terrible end for such a beautiful, yet flawed, woman. This is one 
     of the most mysterious deaths for many, many years and her death 
     still has not beeen resolved, especially the question of why it took 
     so long to discover her body. In today's society, that's unforgivable.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     the 60's until his death. Mr. Hagen had starring roles in such films 
     as ANGELS' WILD WOMEN [1972], WONDER WOMEN (1973) and NIGHT CREATURE 
     (1978), as well as having supporting roles in films like AVENGING 
     ANGEL (1985), ACTION U.S.A. (1989) and BLOOD GAMES (1990). Fred Olen 
     Ray used Mr. Hagen in many films during the 80's &amp; 90's, 
     including PRISON SHIP (1986), ALIENATOR (1990) and DINOSAUR ISLAND 
     (1994). Hagen directed a handful of genre films during his career, 
     including THE GLOVE (1978), B.O.R.N. (1988) and CLICK: THE CALENDER 
     GIRL KILLER (1990). R.I.P. Ross Hagen, and thanks for the memories.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     hooked and tried to watch everything she appeared in, from her 
     Acadamy Award-nominated performance as James Keach's girlfriend in 
     FAT CITY (1972), her mentally handicapped Mary in ANDY WARHOL'S BAD 
     (1977) and the independent &quot;Huh?&quot; film FORBIDDEN ZONE 
     (1982). She continued acting even though she lost both legs below the 
     knees due to a blood disease in April 2000 (and shows us in the film 
     BUDDY BOY - 2000) and once you saw her perform, you never forgot her. 
     She once said, &quot;The last thing my mother said to me was, 'SuSu, 
     your life is a celebration of everything that is cheap and tawdry.' 
     I've always liked that, and I've always tried to live up to it.&quot; 
     We are all better off for it. Other films Susan Tyrrell appeared in 
     were CATCH MY SOUL (1974) THE KILLER INSIDE ME (1976), TALES OF 
     ORDINARY MADNESS (1981), FAST-WALKING (1982), ANGEL (1984 - She's 
     unforgettable here), AVENGING ANGEL (1985), FLESH + BLOOD (1985), THE 
     OFFSPRING (1987), BIG TOP PEE-WEE (1988), CRY-BABY (1990), POWDER 
     (1995) and THE BONEYARD COLLECTION (2006), among many others. Thanks 
     for the memories, Susan, and I hope you can find some cheap and 
     tawdry people in Heaven. I know there must be some up there.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

      and mostly due to his tremendous talents. Who can forget his epic 
     ending fight with Chuck Norris in INVASION U.S.A. (1985), one of the 
     best action films of the 80's? Richard Lynch immediately caught 
     audiences attention in his debut film, the 1973 drama SCARECROW (he 
     managed to outshine both Gene Hackman and Al Pacino!). After that 
     performance, he was in high demand, both in regular and genre films, 
     appearing as a hitman in THE SEVEN-UPS (1973), a hunter with no 
     conscious in OPEN SEASON (1974), and plenty of TV appearances, 
     usually as the villain. But it was his roles in horror and action 
     films that made genre film fans stand up and take notice, The first 
     one being the scary dude in THE PREMONITION (1975), an 
     uncharacterizable figure in Larry Cohen's GOD TOLD ME TO (1976) and a 
     bloodsucker in the 1979 TV film, THE VAMPIRE (1979). Other Lynch 
     films include THE BARON (1977), GOOD AGAINST EVIL (1977), DEATHSPORT 
     (1978), STEEL (1979), DELTA FOX (1979; a rare starring role as a good 
     guy), THE NINTH CONFIGURATION (1979; his fight in a bar is a thing of 
     beauty), THE SWORD AND THE SORCERER (1982), CUT AND RUN (1985), 
     SAVAGE DAWN (1985), BAD DREAMS (1988), ONE MAN FORCE (1989), LOCKDOWN 
     (1990), ALLIGATOR II: THE MUTATION (1991), TRANCERS II (1991), 
     SCANNER COP (1994), MINER'S MASSACRE (2002), LAID TO REST (2009) and 
     Rob Zombie's THE LORDS OF SALEM (2012; Lynch's final film). Mr. 
     Lynch's death is a terrible, terrible loss to the genre community.

      Borgnine has always made me think he was an actor who would never 
     die. I saw him on an interview with Tavis Smiley a short while ago 
     and he looked at least 30 years younger than his 95 years. His 
     secret: Don't retire and keep on acting, something he did<A HREF="ernest_borgnine_photo.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ernest borgnine photo small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="184" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
     right up until his death. Known basically for his bad guy roles in 
     50's films such as FROM HERE TO ETERNITY (1953), JOHNNY GUITAR (1954) 
     and BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK (1955), Ernie would turn everyone's head in 
     1955 with his sweet-natured role as Marty Piletti in the drama MARTY, 
     which earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His gap-toothed 
     grin could make you smile or send chills right through your bones. 
     Known basically to Baby-Boomers as the good-natured Lt. Commander 
     Quinton McHale in the long-running TV series MCHALE'S NAVY (1962 - 
     1966), Borgnine had no problem shedding that image after the series 
     ended (that in itself is quite a feat), appearing is such films as 
     THE DIRTY DOZEN (1967), ICE STATION ZEBRA (1968), THE WILD BUNCH 
     (1969; if you've never seen it, you can't consider yourself a film 
     lover), WILLARD (1971; man, he was mean in this one and his death is 
     memorable), BUNNY O'HARE (1971), THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE (1972), 
     EMPEROR OF THE NORTH&nbsp; (1973; my favorite of his bad guy roles), 
     SUNDAY IN THE COUNTRY (1974), THE DEVIL'S RAIN (1975), THE GHOST OF 
     FLIGHT 401 (1978), RAVAGERS (1979), SUPER FUZZ (1980), ESCAPE FROM 
     NEW YORK (1981), DEADLY BLESSING (1981), YOUNG WARRIORS (1983), CODE 
     NAME: WILD GEESE (1984), SKELETON COAST (1987), LASER MISSION (1989), 
     RED (2010), the voice of &quot;Mermaid Man&quot; on SPONGEBOB 
     SQUAREPANTS and hundreds more. As you can see by the small amounts of 
     titles I listed, Ernest Borgnine was comfortable in any role spanning 
     all genres. He was truly an original and will be missed by all of us 
     who have enjoyed his performances since we were kids. 95 is a good, 
     ripe old age to pass away (although I was still surprised by his 
     death due to renal failure), but his film work will be eternal. 
     Thanks for all the memories Ernie!</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

     The producers of the DALLAS reboot say they will incorporate J.R.'s 
     death into the series. Even though Larry Hagman wasn't supposed to be 
     the lead in the reboot, he dominated every scene he was in. It might 
     as well now be shown on </FONT></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT COLOR="GREEN"><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="3">The
      CW, since the plots will focus on the younger Ewing clan. UPDATE #2: 
     The TNT show plans an episode dealing with J.R.'s death and promises 
     plenty of &quot;Guest Stars&quot;. Maybe Jenilee Harrison, Victoria 
     Principal, Pricilla Presley and Brad Pitt will show up! Or maybe 
     they'll dig up the corpse of Jim Davis and put him in the coffin with 
     J.R. Weirder things have happened (Remember the shower scene with 
     Patrick Duffy, making the season before it nothing but Victoria 
     Principal's bad dream?). The original DALLAS never recoverered after 
     that misstep. A true &quot;Jump The Shark&quot; moment. UPDATE #3: 
     TNT canceled DALLAS in 2014, proving that Larry Hagman was what made 
     DALLAS such a spellbinding experience..</FONT></FONT></FONT></B></P>

      one of the first groundbreaking film critics to reach tremendous 
     popularity. While I loved to laugh at his and film partner Gene 
     Siskel's evisceration of slasher films in the early 1980's on their 
     TV shows SNEAK PREVIEWS/AT THE MOVIES - 1980-1990, there was no doubt 
     that Mr. Ebert was one of the most knowledgeable film critics ever. 
     And he lived for film and loved every minute of it. While most people 
     would have retired after receiving bad news about having cancer [and 
     losing part of his jaw], he kept on reviewing films in his own unique 
     manner. While I seldom agreed with his assessments of films [he 
     particulalrly was very nasty towards horror films], I still bought 
     many of his books, my favorite being YOUR MOVIE SUCKS. All this 
     coming from the man who wrote the screenplays for BEYOND THE VALLEY 
     OF THE DOLLS - 1970; UP! - 1976; and BENEATH THE VALLEY OF THE 
     ULTRA-VIXENS - 1979 for director Russ Meyer. Mr. Ebert was never 
     ashamed of these films and would talk about them frankly [it also 
     helped that these films are considered classics by violence/softcore 
     porn fans like myself]. With sadness in my heart, I must now say: 
     &quot;The balcony is now closed forever and see you at the

     effects and directed most of the Puppetoon shorts for producer George 
     Pal during the 1940's and was also a cameraman with Frank Capra for 
     the military during World War II. He was a creative mastermind (the 
     fight with the skeletons in JASON will always stick in my mind), only 
     hampered by time and monetary restraints, but he achieved many great 
     things during his lifetime, especially to this young impressionable 
     lad during the 60's. He had no grievances against CGI except that it 
     was becoming &quot;overexposed&quot; and you always knew how it was 
     done. It took the mystery out of films. Tom Hanks once said, 
     &quot;Many people think CITIZEN KANE is the best movie of all time. I 
     think it is JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS.&quot; That was one of the nicest

     every genre, including over 370 two-hour tapes of &quot;Nudie

     (Actor: Pudgy, but excellent actor who always took a role and made it 
     his own, no matter what genre it was. He could easily play comedy as 
     he could drama. Unfortunately, his real-life heroin addiction was a 
     well-known open secret and he was found in his own NYC apartment 
     bathroom dead at the age 46 of a heroin overdose with the needle 
     still sticking in his arm. This should be a wake-up call to the 
     Hollywood establishment and make every actor take a drug test before 
     they are offered a role. We have seen too much of this kind of 
     behavior happen in Tinsletown [and other places] to let it go on any 
     longer. Philip Seymour Hoffman was bound to have plenty of 
     award-winning roles ahead of him, but heroin cut any chance for that 
     short. It's time for people to wake up and stare into reality. Roles 
     are not more important than lives. Some of Mr. Hoffmann's roles 
     during his short life read like a who's who of great directors and 
     include: MY NEW GUN - 1992; SCENT OF A WOMAN - 1992; MY BOYFRIEND'S

     and seven days from finishing filming the second part of THE HUNGER 
     GAMES: MOCKINGJAY when the terrible scourge of drug addiction took 
     him from us. Just look at his output in just a matter of 13 years [he 
     also had a guest role on TV's LAW &amp; ORDER in 1991, his first 
     role, although you would never know it. It was his only foray into TV 
     Series, although he was nominated for a Daytime Emmy&copy; for the 
     use of his voice in the long-running kids animated TV series ARTHUR - 
     1996-Present in 1996.]. We lost an excellent actor, but when those 
     demon drugs grab a hold of your soul [apparently, police found over 
     50 bags of heroin in Hoffman's apartment, as well as various bottles 
     of addictive prescription drugs] and won't let go, he needed the help 
     of friends to get control of his life back. Unfortunately, there were 
     none on that fateful day. His first autospy was labeled 
     &quot;inconclusive&quot; (what a fucking joke!), so further tests 
     have to be taken before he can be buried. A devastating loss to the 
     filmmaking community. My heartfelt condolences go out to his family.)

      TEMPLE BLACK</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN"> (Actress: While not known 
     for her genre films, Shirley Temple was one of the most popular 
     singing and dancing child stars ever, who turned her back on show 
     business in the mid-60's and became an environmental activist and 
     then became involved in politics, where she was taken very seriously. 
     For all you genre fans out there, she was once married to the late 
     John Agar and took the last name &quot;Black&quot; when she married 
     Charles Black in 1950 and stayed married to him until his death in 
     2005. Some of Ms. Temple's films include: STAND UP AND CHEER! - 1934; 
     LITTLE MISS MARKER - 1934; NOW AND FOREVER - 1934; BRIGHT EYES - 
     1934; THE LITTLE COLONEL - 1935; CURLY TOP - 1935; CAPTAIN JANUARY -

     MR. BELVEDERE GOES TO COLLEGE - 1949; THE STORY OF SEABUSCUIT - 1949; 
     A KISS FOR CORLISS - 1949 [her last theatrical film]. Ms. Temple did 
     very little TV, She had he own omnibus show called SHIRLEY TEMPLE'S 
     STORYBOOK - 1958 - 1961, on which she appeared 12 times and made a 
     personal appearance on THE RED SKELTON HOUR in 1963. She made a TV 
     pilot in 1965 called GO FIGHT CITY HALL, but it was not picked-up and 
     she gave up on show business and turned her talents elsewhere. Many 
     believe her life after films was much more important, since she did 
     so much for the environment and was friendly with many Presidents 
     [she was appointed U.S. Ambassador to both Ghana and Czechoslovakia] 
     and was named as a delegate to the United Nations in 1969 by 
     President Nixon. She also had a radical masectomy and made it public, 
     which gave hope and courage to many women. She was truly one of a 
     kind. Ms. Temple was 85 years-old.) - 02/10/14</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

     years!].&nbsp; Was nominated for Broadway's 1980 Tony Award&reg; as 
     Best Actor (Musical) for SUGAR BABIES. Rumor has it that Walt Disney 
     named Mickey Mouse after Rooney. He also has four (!) stars on the 
     Hollywood Walk Of Fame. One of the last of the old-time Movie Stars 
     who worked as a contract player with several different movie 
     production companies. Was married eight times [including Ava Gardner 
     and Martha Vickers and was married to Jan Rooney from 1978 until his 
     death, even though they have been &quot;permanently separated since 
     June 2012 and Mickey had been living with his stepson Mark Rooney and 
     his wife Charlene]. He and Jackie Gleason were the first actors 
     considered to play Archie Bunker in ALL IN THE FAMILY, but both 
     turned it down because they thought they couldn't speak such bigoted 
     dialogue without it ruining their careers [we now know that would not 
     be the case]. He is also the only actor to appear in a film in ten 
     consecutive decades. He also had a firm dislike for the late Ernest 
     Borgnine (&quot;All the Oscars in the world can't buy him dignity, 
     class and talent. I don't know why he is famous and why he is a star. 
     Talk about a lucky jerk.&quot;). He was firmly anti-gay [&quot;I 
     never knew anything about anyone being gay in Hollywood when I was 
     working in the studios. Did you know that? They weren't in closets, 
     they were in safes.&quot;], but was willing to admit that there are 
     many people anti-Mickey Rooney, too, and he attributed all his 
     audience members, whether straight or gay, as his &quot;family&quot;. 
     Mickey Rooney was 93 years-old, 89 of those years as an actor. This 
     is truly the end of an era and a sad day in the film business. We 
     shall never see the likes of him again.) - 04/06/14|</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

      since he announced he was retiring from the ring. Although he didn't 
     make many movies and was just inducted into the WWE Wrestling Hall of 
     Fame a few days earlier, good things looked like they were coming his 
     way. Then he unexpectedly died after collasping of undisclosed 
     reasons at the front of a hotel in Arizona on April 8, 2014. His last 
     public appearance was on WWE's &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; the day 
     before to thunderous applause. This should teach everyone that fame, 
     money and success mean absolutely nothing if you don't have your 
     health. I remember his signature moves &quot;The Gorilla Press 
     Slam&quot; and the finishing move &quot;The Running Splash&quot;. 
     When he entered the ring, he made quite an impression with his 
     multicolored face paint and his habit of shaking the ring's ropes 
     until they nearly fell off. I usually don't mention wrestlers in my 
     obituary column, but The Ultimate Warrior was one of the main reasons 
     I watched wrestling for nearly ten years. His small filmography 
     included parts in: ODD JOBS -- 1986; and FIREPOWER - 1993. He also 
     appeared in hundreds of televised wrestling matches, starting with 
     WRESTLEMANIA IV - 1987. Hellwig, who had his name legally changed to 
     The Ultimate Warrior in the early 90's, was only 54 years-old when he

     director Alejandro Jodorowsky's late-70's version of DUNE, which 
     never happened (There's a documentary called JODOROWSKY'S DUNE [2013] 
     about the failed attempt and is must-viewing for seeing how quickly a 
     good idea can go bad.). He also designed album covers for rock stars, 
     and Debbie Harry's and Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer's album covers were 
     voted among the 100 best in music history in a survey of rock 
     journalists. Owning a piece of his original art and sculptures were 
     in the same league as owning an original Rembrandt or Remington. Now 
     they will just become twice as expensive. His art exhibits were 
     always a mind-bender (and definitely not for the weak-hearted) and 
     there's a permanent one located in Las Vegas. If you are ever in

     Achievement Award from Billboard Magazine in 1997. Kasem made the 
     news for nearly a month before his death because his second wife 
     Jean, whom he was married to since 1980, hid him from his three 
     children [from his first wife Linda Myers] and wouldn't allow them to 
     see him. When he was found, thanks to a court order, and was 
     determined to be suffering from severe dementia [it was announced in 
     2013 that he was diagnosed with advanced Parkinson's disease] and 
     unable to get out of bed, his children decided he was better off 
     being withheld food and life support and he died a couple of days 
     later. Now the children and the wife are fighting over his body. 
     Absolutely ridiculous. This is no way to treat a legend, even in 
     death. Mr. Kasem was 82 years-old. &quot;Keep your feet on the ground

     Rugged, handsome actor who play heavies and good guys throughout his 
     career. He was talented enough to become a leading man, but just 
     didn't seem to be able to break that wall. He usually played 
     character parts and the occasional lead role in B-films [he was a 
     stock player for producer Roger Corman in the 50's]. He also did a 
     lot of TV [He did 436 episodes of PEYTON PLACE from 1964 to 1969 and 
     a lot of TV Movies during the 70's &amp; 80's], so his face should be

     not to see Ed Nelson in one of your favorite shows. He was the 
     consummate professional character actor who had a healthy life in 
     both movies and TV. Another one of my childhood heroes to pass away 
     this year. He is the father of Christopher S. Nelson, who starred in 
     director Greydon Clark's WITHOUT WARNING - 1980 and was married to 
     the same woman [Patricia Amelia Miller] from 1951 up till the time of 
     his death, an amazing 63 years! Ed Nelson was 85 years-old when he

     (Comedian/Actor: Now this one comes as an actual shock because Robin 
     Williams seemed to have it all, but a severe bout of depression made 
     him commit suicide [he hung himself, but I will not reveal how]. It 
     just proves that drama is easy, but comedy comes from a place most of 
     us rather not find within ourselves, because it usually comes from a 
     place that is dark, deep and dank. Some say to truly be a great 
     comedian, you have had to suffer in your life, and as we have learned 
     from Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor [Williams idolized both Pryor and 
     Jonathan Winters and got the opportunity to work with each of them 
     more than once] and countless other comedians who self-destructed 
     before their time, that old addage is true. Comedy may be <!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/robin williams photo2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="104" HEIGHT="121" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="Robin Williams as Mork" BORDER="0">funny
      to the audience, but true comedians suffer for their craft. I am 
     sorry to have to say that Robin Williams is one of the latest. 
     Williams started as a standup comedian and appearing in various 
     low-budget movies and TV shows until his role of alien Mork on two 
     episodes of HAPPY DAYS - 1978-1979 made him a true TV star, which led 
     to the wild and popular series MORK &amp; MINDY - 1978-1982. where 
     Williams would ad-lib some of his lines and crack up the cast, crew 
     and audience. So many retakes had to be filmed for the half hour 
     series, that Williams was nearly ordered to cut back on the 
     improvisation, but you can't tell a comic to quit what he does best 
     [the writers finally left some script pages blank and said that this 
     is the place where Williams could try whatever he wanted]. After the 
     series ended, Williams went on to become a popular theatrical 
     comedian and drama actor, which surprised many people. His theatrical 
     films included: CAN I DO IT 'TILL I NEED GLASSES? - 1977 [his debut]; 
     POPEYE - 1980; {Williams said, &quot;If you watch it backwards, it 
     has a plot!&quot;]; THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP - 1982 [the film that 
     after MORK &amp; MINDY ended, put Williams on the actor map and made 
     him a boxoffice star]; THE SURVIVORS - 1983; MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON - 
     1984; THE BEST OF TIMES - 1986; CLUB PARADISE - 1986; SEIZE THE DAY - 
     1986; DEAR AMERICA: LETTERS HOME FROM VIETNAM - 1987; GOOD MORNING

     and drama; nominated for an Academy Award&reg; for Best Actor];

     &quot;baby&quot; on the final season of MORK &amp; MINDY]; THE

     THE CRAZY ONES - 2013-2014 [series regular; the show was getting 
     decent ratings, but CBS canceled it anyway, which may have brought 
     back his depression; this is my speculation only]. Along with friends 
     Billy Crystal and Whoopie Goldberg, hosted the yearly COMIC RELIEF 
     telethons, which from 1986 to 2010 helped the nation's homeless and 
     raised over $50 million. Williams battled alcohol and drug addiction 
     in the past and seemed to have won both of those battles, but 
     depression is probably one of the worst diseases [besides cancer] 
     that a person can go through [His wife has also said he was suffering 
     from the early stages of Parkinson's Disease]. I hope wherever Robin 
     Williams is now, he knows that he had a lot of fans here and we hated 
     to see him leave. He still had so much potential, but, like I said

     (Actress: Holy hell, this has been a bad week for celebrity deaths. 
     When I was a kid and watched Bacall with Humphrey Bogart, I was the 
     most jealous man in the world. I LOVED Lauren Bacall (and still do), 
     so the report of her death a day after Robin Williams, was like a 
     one-two punch in the gut. Lauren Bacall was a dreamy young woman when 
     she started out in films and had that long beautiful face, flowing 
     hair and raspy voice that kids like me loved to listen to. I could 
     spend hours just listening to Ms. Bacall reading the phone <!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/lauren bacall photo small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="109" HEIGHT="121" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="Lauren Bacall" BORDER="0">book.
      During her later years, Bacall continued to work and I was still 
     glad to see her because she was still one of the very few people who 
     had &quot;it&quot;. And &quot;it&quot; was very special to people 
     like me. Even though she loved Bogey very much [they were my picture 
     of an ideal perfect married couple], and was married to him from 1945 
     until Bogart's death in 1957 (bearing two children with him), she 
     eventually married actor Jason Robards from 1961 to 1969 (bearing one 
     child) and never married again. One can only guess why, but I prefer 
     to believe that her love for Humphrey Bogart was so strong, that no 
     other man could step into his shoes. She was my favorite actress of 
     all time and the news of her death affects me greatly. During her 
     later years, she was a tough old broad, but I'm sure she would be 
     happy that someone said that about her. Ms. Bacall's films included:

     his wonderful voice and will miss him dearly. During his 90th 
     birthday, the cast of SNL brought him onstage during the finale of 
     the show and paid tribute to him. His face may not be familiar, but 
     his voice was one-of-a-kind and we should all be thankful for it. Mr.

     (Comedienne/Actress/Writer/Director: Born Joan Alexandra Molinsky, 
     Joan Rivers was known for her acerbic humor [No one was safe, 
     including her husband Edgar Rosenberg, who passed away in 1987 by 
     suicide and Joan never remarried. Her greatest regret is that early 
     in her career she use to tell this joke: &quot;One of the earliest 
     jokes I did about my husband was that I was the one who really caused 
     Edgar's suicide, because, while we were making love, I took the bag 
     off my head.&quot;] and her many plastic surgeries (which made most 
     of her face immobile), Joan Rivers' career ebbed and flowed so often, 
     it was hard to keep up with her. She was hot once again, thanks to 
     the pairing with her daughter Melissa and their witty remarks at red 
     carpet events and reality shows [first for the E! Channel, then for 
     the TV Guide Channel], but a vocal cord operation went wrong and Ms. 
     Rivers was induced into a medical coma which she never came out of. 
     Love her or hate her (I found her hilarious at one moment and 
     infuriating at<!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/joan rivers photo small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="118" HEIGHT="121" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="Joan Rivers" BORDER="0"> 
     the next), she definitely knew how to play to an audience. I remember 
     as a kid watching her on the ED SULLIVAN SHOW doing her six minute 
     routine and she was as clean as could be. By the time she went out on 
     her own, she became known as a &quot;blue&quot; comedienne, someone 
     who would do or say anything that came into her mind and most people 
     loved her concerts. So here's to Joan Rivers: I hope where ever you 
     are, you are making people laugh so hard they are peeing their pants. 
     I'm sure she would enjoy that. Joan Rivers only Directed and co-wrote 
     one movie, the highly reviled RABBIT TEST - 1978, about a man (Billy 
     Crystal) finding out he was pregnant. Watching it today, I found that 
     it is basically a kitchen sink comedy that predates AIRPLANE! - 1980 
     and is similar in plot to the much later Arnold 
     Schwarzenegger-starrer JUNIOR - 1994. So like Joan Rivers would so 
     often say: &quot;Can we talk?&quot; Ms. Rivers acting roles included

      </FONT><FONT COLOR="MAROON">I</FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">n his prime, 
     Glen A. Larson could have sold a pilot for ice to the Eskimo Network. 
     The prolific producer, who died Friday, November 14, 2014 at the age 
     of 77, was not afraid of stretching the limits of physics and 
     credulity in the pursuit of a hit series. He gave us K.I.T.T., the 
     talking supercomputer car of KNIGHT RIDER. He gave us Steve Austin, 
     the astronaut whose creaky atomic-powered implants gave him 
     superhuman strength. He put Lorne Greene in a track suit and cape to 
     lead BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. And he sicced a mild-mannered NYU 
     professor who turns into fierce animals on NBC with MANIMAL. But even 
     with a track record of success that also included QUINCY, M.E., 
     MAGNUM, P.I., THE FALL GUY and, yes, B.J. AND THE BEAR, Larson had 
     plenty of ones that got away. Culled from the pages of Variety, 
     here&#146;s a look at eight Larson pilots that never made it to 
     series. Most of them did see the light of primetime eventually, 
     airing as TV movies or busted pilots during off-peak periods.</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>
     <FONT FACE="Arial Black,Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT COLOR="NAVY">THE
      WONDERFUL WORLD OF SIN &#151; three half-hour pilots produced for 
     NBC in 1973. The idea was to focus on a cardinal sin in each episode. 
     The prototype half-hours dealt with sloth, lust and envy, with a cast 
     that included a post BEWITCHED Dick Sargent and Julie 
     &#147;Catwoman&#148; Newmar. The pilots were eventually strung 
     together and ran in 1974 as a telepic under the title FOOLS, FEMALES 
     AND FUN.</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

      ISLANDER &#151; first developed for NBC in 1977, the project shifted 
     to CBS and got made as a pilot but went no further. Dennis Weaver, 
     who Larson worked with in MCCLOUD, starred as a retired lawyer who 
     buys a hotel in Hawaii. Bernadette Peters and Sharon Gless 
     co-starred. The setting was clearly a warm-up for planting MAGNUM in 
     the 50th state.</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

      the masterwork of busted Larson pilots has to be BENNY AND BARNEY, a 
     1976 effort for NBC that revolved around rookie cops in Las Vegas. 
     When it ran as a telepic (BENNY AND BARNEY: LAS VEGAS UNDERCOVER) in 
     January 1977, Variety&#146;s reviewer noted that the show bore more 
     than a passing resemblance to ABC&#146;s STARSKY AND HUTCH. BENNY was 
     so bad, so riddled with cliches that it inspired the introductory 
     disclaimer below from the critic ID&#146;d only by the pseudonym 
     &#147;Mor&#148; (as was the paper&#146;s cryptic custom for reviews 
     back then). &#147;One school of thought maintains that the worst 
     examples of popular art become classics in 20 years, the implication 
     being that judgment should be suspended on the junk-food diet of 
     television lest some future cultural dietitian find it nutritious and 
     delicious. If that dubious proposition holds water, then BENNY AND 
     BARNEY should be put into a time capsule along with a nomination for 
     best potential for future schlock.&#148; Mor was undoubtedly 
     comforted in later years to see MANIMAL consistently voted among the 
     worst TV shows of all time. But Larson by his own admission 
     didn&#146;t care much for the opinion of TV critics. He kept selling, 
     writing and producing shows into the 1990s &#151; and laughed all the 
     way to the bank.</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN">) - 11/14/14</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

     novels [she was nicknamed &quot;The Queen Of Crime'] were turned into 
     movies, TV mini-series and TV Series [usually featuring her favorite 
     creation, Scotland Yard sleuth Adam Dalgliesh {used in 12 of her 20 
     novels}, portrayed first by British actor Roy Marsden and later by 
     actor Martin Shaw]. Her tough, no-nonsense approach to the subject 
     was usually gritty, real and bloody and she never believed that crime 
     novels should be considered B-material. She didn't write her first 
     novel until she was 40 in 1964 [right after the death of her husband, 
     whom she was married to since 1941 and never married again] to 
     support her family and continued to work as a civil servant until 
     1979 [she became a millionaire in 1980 after the publication of her 
     eighth book, INNOCENT BLOOD]. Younger crime novelists accused her of 
     snobbery because she liked to write about middle-class murderers, 
     preferably intelligent and well-educated, who agonize over right and 
     wrong and spend time planning and justifying their crimes, but that 
     was usually jealousy talking and she offered no apologies for her 
     settings, saying her interest was in what made people tick. Some of 
     her novels were turned into: AN UNSUITABLE JOB FOR A WOMAN - 1982 
     [Theatrical Film]; DEATH OF AN EXPERT WITNESS - 1983 [TV 
     mini-series]; SHROUD FOR A NIGHTINGALE - 1984 [TV mini-series]; COVER

     based on Lloyd's own experiences working at Simpsons of Piccadilly. 
     He was also the subject of a persistent urban legend which claims 
     that he was invited to a dinner party at the home of Sharon Tate on 
     the night that she was murdered by followers of Charles Manson. There 
     seems to be no truth in this myth, as Lloyd was performing at a live 
     show in New York during the week of Tate's death, and there is no 
     evidence to suggest that he had ever met Tate or her husband, Roman 
     Polanski, while she was still living. Jeremy Lloyd was 84 years-old.)

     Jr.'s, Irene Ryan's and herself, before co-starring on THE BEVERLY 
     HILLBILLIES (1962)]: &quot;It was the American Dream. But I think it 
     had a lot of good things in it, too. We were all so grateful to be 
     working, Buddy Ebsen--he had started out in vaudeville, and he had 
     done many things, but his career wasn't on an upswing or anything. 
     Granny, [Irene Ryan] she wasn't really doing anything. Max Baer and 
     I, we were babies just starting out, so everybody was so grateful to 
     be working.&quot; Donna Douglas was proud of her role as Elly May 
     Clampett in THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES and occasionally made public 
     appearances dressed as Elly May. She spent hours autographing photos 
     and personally responding to fan mail - even though she received far 
     more than anyone else in the cast of THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES. She 
     grew closest to member Buddy Ebsen and considered him her &quot;second
      father&quot;. When Ebsen passed away in 2003, Ms. Douglas was 
     devastated [She even attended Irene Ryan's funeral in 1973]. Ms. 
     Douglas had a second career as a gospel singer, as well as a popular 
     real estate agent in Beverly Hills, California. Donna Douglas was 81 
     years-old.) - 01/01/15</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

      day, a baby elephant was going to appear on MANHATTAN SPOTLIGHT.

     started trumpeting...On the air, Captain Video stood up and said,

     but get down, it might be dangerous!'&quot; When Mr. Kenney retired

     CAME ALONG [combined with her excellent stage work], movie mogul Hal 
     B.Wallis starred Lizabeth Scott in THE STRANGE LOVE OF MARTHA IVERS 
     (1946) over Barbara Stanwyck's protests. Scott ended up in third 
     place at the top behind Stanwyck and Van Heflin, with Kirk Douglas, 
     in his film debut, billed below the three stars. The film is actually 
     two in one, with Stanwyck and Scott inhabiting two parallel worlds, 
     both linked by Heflin. The female leads have only one brief scene 
     together. The director, Lewis Milestone, swore never to work with 
     Wallis again, who wanted to re-shoot all of Scott's scenes, which 
     Wallis had to do personally. The film boasts an Oscar nominated 
     screenplay by Robert Rossen, music by Mikl&oacute;s R&oacute;zsa, art 
     direction by Hans Dreier, and costumes by Edith Head. Lizabeth Scott 
     spent her remaining years working for various charities such as

     It was he who found the body of his only child, Louis Henry, 29, in 
     his Beverly Hills home. His son had suffered from depression and had 
     apparently taken an overdose of drugs. The police labeled it a 
     suicide, even though it may have been an accidental overdose. He was 
     married to the same woman [Berthe 'Quique' Frederique Jourdan] from 
     1946 until her death in 2014 and once said in the late-70's: 
     &quot;When one has been married over thirty years, of course it would 
     be absurd not to admit there have been some difficulties, at some 
     times. But the important thing is that we have weathered them.&quot;

     before being nerdy was cool, there was Leonard Nimoy. Leonard was a 
     lifelong lover of the arts and humanities, a supporter of the 
     sciences, generous with his talent and his time. And of course, 
     Leonard was Spock. Cool, logical, big-eared and level-headed, the 
     center of Star Trek&#146;s optimistic, inclusive vision of 
     humanity&#146;s future. I loved Spock. In 2007, I had the chance to 
     meet Leonard in person. It was only logical to greet him with the 
     Vulcan salute, the universal sign for &#147;Live long and 
     prosper.&#148; And after 83 years on this planet &#150; and on his 
     visits to many others &#150; it&#146;s clear Leonard Nimoy did just 
     that. Michelle and I join his family, friends, and countless fans who 
     miss him so dearly today.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN"> More 
     praises for Leonard Nimoy flowed in soon after: Zachary Quinto, who 
     took over the role of Spock in the STAR TREK reboot and acted 
     alongside Nimoy in two films thanks to the films' time-twisting plot 
     lines, shared on his Instagram,</FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY"> &quot;My 
     heart is broken. I love you profoundly my dear friend. And I will 
     miss you every day. May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.&quot;

     &quot;Dearest Leonard. What a man you were. What a life you lived. As 
     funny and thoughtful and generous and loving as you were talented.

      of the most unique messages of remembrance for the legendary STAR 
     TREK star came from the final frontier of space itself, when NASA 
     astronaut Terry Virts posted a photo doing a Vulcan hand salute on 
     the International Space Station. The simple message &#147;LLAP&#148; 
     - meaning &#147;Live long and prosper&#148; - accompanied the split-fingered

      I will sure miss him, too. If there is an afterlife, may he Live 
     Long and Prosper. It just will never be the same not hearing his 
     booming voice on TV and in films, but at least we have his body of 
     work to fall back on. And what a body of work! Leonard Nimoy died of

     with Roddenberry on the movies. I was fortunate enough to have a 
     mandate from Paramount not to pay any attention to him, which is 
     easier said than done because he is the master manipulator of a large 
     and loyal following. It's like the Bolshevik party, it isn't that 
     there were so many of them, it's just that they were so smart and 
     vociferous. He is a remarkable visionary, but a very bad supervisor 
     of other writers. I don't want to rake muck, because it is not my 
     nature to do that. There is a tremendous misconception about 
     Roddenberry. I am his replacement. His vengeance, some say, is STAR 
     TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION. He alienated some really creative people 
     who were doing the very best to make his show a hit. That's the 
     summation of what my perspective is.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN"> 
     Harve Bennett left the Star Trek universe [he was offered $1.5 
     million to Produce STAR TREK VI: THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY - 1991, but 
     turned it down]&nbsp; when Rodenberry and his fanbase viciously 
     opposed his idea of making a STAR TREK prequel, with much younger 
     actors playing the roles of Kirk, Spock, etc.. J.J. Abrams was very 
     successful with the idea in 2009 with the reboot of STAR TREK. Harve

      was recruited to play football at Stanford but quit after one day of 
     practice. While he was a student there, he drew sports cartoons for 
     The San Francisco Chronicle. He graduated in 1977. Four years later, 
     after he had worked as a storyboard artist and writer for Filmation 
     Studios, he mailed an unsolicited script to the producers of TAXI. 
     They accepted and produced his script, and by the following year, Mr.

     writing and producing for several other shows, including CHEERS.

      Mr. Simon helped develop other series, including the short-lived 
     program THE GEORGE CARLIN SHOW and the THE DREW CAREY SHOW which 
     enjoyed a long run. He also became a competitive poker player and 
     hosted a program on Playboy TV featuring celebrities playing Texas 
     hold &#146;em. He was a frequent guest on Howard Stern&#146;s radio 
     show. He was recently a consultant on the Charlie Sheen sitcom ANGER 
     MANAGEMENT In 1997, he entered a different arena entirely when he 
     began managing the boxer Lamon Brewster. In 2004, Mr. Brewster won 
     the World Boxing Organization heavyweight championship. Mr. 
     Simon&#146;s marriage to the actress and competitive poker player 
     Jennifer Tilly ended in divorce, but the two remained close. A brief 
     marriage to Jami Ferrell, a Playboy model, also ended in divorce. 
     Information about survivors was not immediately available. One 
     beneficiary of his philanthropy, the Sea Shepherd Society, which 
     opposes whale hunting, named one of its boats for Mr. Simon. (Others 
     are also named for celebrity supporters.) In 2011, his Sam Simon 
     Foundation started a program that provides low-income families with 
     free vegan meals. Asked whether he was imposing his own vegan diet on

     TROUBADOR. He was also the author of the 1971 book &quot;The Film 
     Director&quot; (MacMillan Company), which became the classic 
     &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; text on that profession. In the spirit of 
     low budgets, Collier Books issued a soft cover edition in 1973 with a 
     cover price of only $2.95. A second edition was published in 2000.

     injury while doing a stunt on a movie set in 2002. He was forced to 
     use a cane or motor scooter to get around until he made an 
     almost-complete recovery by 2006. This is a terrible loss for the

      Almond has written eight novels in The Alford Saga (historical

     Survivor (Book 2, published in 2011) and The Pioneer (Book 3,

      this is what Ms. Whitney had to say about her &quot;termination&quot;
      on the original STAR TREK TV Series: </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;They
      wanted William Shatner to have romances in each episode with a 
     different person, because for him to be stuck with one woman was not 
     good for him and it wasn't good for the audience. That's what they 
     told me, so I was written out. There were two blonde girls and one 
     black girl. Nichelle Nichols was a more important character and 
     couldn't be written out. Everything's political in America. One of 
     the blondes have to go. The other one was engaged to the boss, so 
     guess who went? I just about killed myself. I drank, that's what we 
     do, we drink to get rid of pain. I was really mad. My God, was I 
     bitter.&quot; </FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN">[She became a recovering 
     alcoholic, who helped many people with addiction problems through 
     women&#146;s prisons or the Salvation Army and would rather be 
     remembered for her work in helping people deal with their addictions 
     than as an actress]. Ms. Whitney also appeared as a Contestant Escort 
     on the TV Series QUEEN FOR A DAY - 1956; and appeared in several 
     documentaries about STAR TREK, including: TREKKIES - 1997; BRING 
     BACK...STAR TREK - 2009; and THE CAPTAINS - 2011. She was also a 
     professional singer [opening in clubs for the likes of Billie Holiday 
     and Buddy Rich, and touring with the Spike Jones Band] before she 
     became an actress and continued to sing in a band called STAR, who 
     would play at various STAR TREK conventions throughout the country. 
     Grace Lee Whitney was 85 years-old. She was the oldest surviving 
     member of the original STAR TREK series and now that mantle is held

     goodbye to my last true horror icon and it makes me extremely sad to 
     do so, but the day has come and I just wanted to say: Thank you, Mr. 
     Lee, for making my childhood and adulthood an enjoyable romp at the 
     many movie theaters I saw you in. You will live on forever in your 
     films and your performances. Even though I never met you, your 
     passing away was like losing a family member. I say this with extreme 
     sadness, but with joy in my heart for the many times you made me jump 
     out of my seat and watch you steal every scene you were in. You 
     towered over everyone else, not just in height, but in talent, too. 
     Goodbye, dear friend. If there is a God in Heaven, he now has 
     competition. Sir Christopher Lee's many credits included [films

     created a Knight Bachelor on 13 June 2009 in the Queen's Birthday

      Early in his career, Lee dubbed foreign films into English and other 
     languages including Jacques Tati's MR. HULOT'S HOLIDAY [1953]. 
     Sometimes he dubbed all the voices including women's parts. Douglas 
     Fairbanks, Jr., recalled that Lee could do any kind of accent: 
     &quot;foreign, domestic, North, South, Middle, young, old, 
     everything. He's a great character actor&quot;. On a funnier note on 
     this sad day, Lee was listed as the Center of the Hollywood Universe 
     by the Oracle of Kevin Bacon website at the University of Virginia, 
     because he can be linked to any one in Hollywood on average in 2.59 
     steps. That is less than either Charlton Heston or Kevin Bacon 
     himself. Believe it or not, Mr. Lee was also a fan of heavy metal 
     music. One of his favorite bands was the Italian symphonic power 
     metal band Rhapsody, and he had also appeared on one of their albums 
     [listen to the speech in the intro on the song &quot;Unholy 
     Warcry&quot; on the album &quot;The Dark Secret&quot;]. Lee also 
     appeared on the Rhapsody single &quot;The Magic of the Wizard's 
     Dream&quot;, where he did a duet with Rhapsody vocalist Fabio Leoni 
     in English, German, Italian and French versions of the song. He has 
     also stated that he was a fan of U.S. heavy metal band Manowar, 
     proving that age has nothing to do with tastes in music [He has also 
     said many times that if he didn't become an actor, he would have been 
     an opera singer.]. But this is, indeed, a very sad day because we 
     lost one of the greatest British actors every to grace the screen. My 
     heart is broken and full of fondness for Sir Christopher Lee at the 
     same time. He was the last horror icon and all-around grand actors of 
     my generation. And I will miss him dearly. Sir Christopher Lee died 
     of heart failure and was 93 years-old.) - 06/07/15</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

      was born Fannie Belle Fleming in 1932 in Wilsondale, West Virginia. 
     Her parents were Lora Evans and Goodlow Mullins. She had ten 
     siblings. Blaze left home and moved to Washington, DC while only in 
     her mid-teens. She was discovered by her first manager Red Snyder 
     working as either a hat-check girl or at a donut shop [her story 
     always changed]. Starr got her stage name from Snyder, but, 
     nonetheless, still left him after he attempted to rape her. With her 
     fiery red hair, shapely and voluptuous 38D-24-37 figure, and sultry, 
     energetic, and captivating stage presence (her stage routines 
     included a comedic exploding coach gag and having a large trained 
     black panther untie a ribbon on her costume, which made it fall to 
     the floor), Blaze became a major headliner at the Two O'Clock Club in 
     Baltimore, Maryland, and earned the nicknames &quot;Miss Spontaneous 
     Combustion&quot; and &quot;The Hottest Blaze in Burlesque.&quot; 
     Starr made $1,500 dollars per week at the peak of her stripping 
     career. Among the men's magazines she appeared in at the height of 
     her fame are &quot;Sizzle,&quot; &quot;Ace,&quot; &quot;Scamp,&quot; 
     &quot;Sir!,&quot; &quot;Best for Men,&quot; &quot;Rogue,&quot; and 
     &quot;Modern Man.&quot; Moreover, Starr posed for pictures for noted 
     fetish photographer Irving Klaw. Blaze achieved her greatest 
     notoriety in the late 1950s as the paramour for Louisiana state 
     governor Earl Kemp Long (Earl Long); this affair inspired the 1989 
     feature film BLAZE - 1989, which Paul Newman played Long, Lolita 
     Davidovich portrayed Starr, and it even has a cameo from Ms. Starr as 
     a stripper named Lily. She portrayed herself in the immensely popular 
     Doris Wishman nudie cutie romp BLAZE STARR GOES NUDIST - 1962. In 
     1974, Starr wrote the autobiographical book &quot;Blaze Starr: My 
     Life as Told to Huey Perry.&quot; Blaze retired from stripping in 
     1983. In 1989, Starr had become a gemologist who spent several 
     holiday seasons selling hand-crafted jewelry at the Carrolltowne Mall 
     in Eldersburg, Maryland. Blaze also owned and operated the Two 
     O'Clock Club in Baltimore, Maryland. Ms. Starr also appeared in the 
     1956 documentary BUXOM BEAUTEASE; had a small role as herself in the 
     1990 thriller ON THE BLOCK; and appeared in the essential 2010

     the late-60's &amp; early-70's. Mr. Blauner started out as tragic 
     singer Bobby Darin's manager [where Darin <!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/steve blauner photo small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="103" HEIGHT="121" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="Steve Blauner" BORDER="0">demanded

     Blauner parted ways professionally in 1965 when Darin was nominated 
     for an Academy Award&reg; for CAPTAIN NEWMAN, M.D. but remained 
     friends [After Darin&#146;s death, Blauner represented his estate.]. 
     He then worked for Screen Gems, where he was involved in various 
     capacities with such TV Series as BEWITCHED; HAZEL; I DREAM OF 
     JEANNIE; and THE MONKEES. Blauner then joined Schneider &amp; 
     Rafelson to create BBS Productions (based on the initials of their 
     first names) and made such films as the Monkee's HEAD - 1968; EASY 
     RIDER - 1969 [Nominated for two Academy Awards&reg;]; FIVE EASY 
     PIECES - 1970; THE LAST PICTURE SHOW - 1971 [Two Academy Award&reg;

     and Actress]; DRIVE, HE SAID - 1971; A SAFE PLACE - 1971; THE KING OF 
     MARVIN GARDENS - 1972; and the Academy Award&reg; winning documentary 
     HEARTS AND MINDS - 1974. When BBS Productions disbanded, Mr. Blauner 
     Produced RICHARD PRYOR: LIVE IN CONCERT - 1979; Executive Produced 
     the failed TV Series NEW MONKEES - 1987; and was Consultant on the 
     Bobby Darin bio-pic BEYOND THE SEA - 2004, where he was portrayed 
     onscreen by John Goodman [he continued to be the late Darin's estate 
     manager until the day he died]. Early in Blauner's career, where he 
     worked with TV legend Ernie Kovacs, he also was Technical Advisor on 
     the horror film THE DEVIL'S HAND - 1961. A documentary on the days of 
     BBS Productions and how they created a New Hollywood was made in 2010 
     and called AMERICA LOST AND FOUND: THE BBS STORY, which is required 
     viewing for those who want to know what a force they were in

     Music Composer: Mr. Horner was one of the premiere movie music 
     composers, winning two Academy Awards&reg; and amassing a large 
     amount of other awards. Tragically, he died when a plane he was 
     piloting crashed on Monday June 22 [he was the only person on-board] 
     and he left us a legacy of well over 150 films to remember him by. 
     Horner got his start by supplying music for the films of Producer 
     Roger Corman [which Corman would re-use over and over in his later 
     films, a Corman trait], but quickly moved up the ladder to score 
     A-list films. To list all the films he worked on would be quite the

     and even appeared in two Weird Al Yankovic videos [&quot;Smells Like 
     Nirvana&quot; and &quot;Bedrock Anthem&quot;] as himself. He was also 
     the author of several bestselling books, including &quot;How To Get 
     Your Child Into Show Business&quot;, &quot;Totally Terrific TV 
     Trivia&quot; and his autobiography, &quot;Eight Isn't Enough&quot;. 
     Mr. Van Patten was also known for starting [by lending his name to] 
     &quot;Natural Balance&quot;, a line of high-end dog food that is 
     intended to be indistinguishable from stews and other dishes that are 
     normally intended for human consumption. He is also well known for 
     turning out three sons who would also become actors: Nels Van Patten, 
     James Van Patten and Vincent Van Patten. His sister is actress Joyce 
     Van Patten. His half-brother is Emmy Award&reg;-winning TV director 
     Timothy Van Patten. He was married to actress Pat Poole in 1954 and 
     stayed married to her until his death [61 years]. Mr. Van Patten got 
     a Star on the Walk Of Fame on November 20, 1985 at 1541 N. Vine 
     Street. He was never nominated for any other award, but Baby Boomers 
     like myself always appreciated when he showed up on the TV screen. My

     had little experience as a promoter. I called his manager, Colonel 
     Tom Parker, every day for a year. Every day he'd say no. Finally, 
     after a year of calling, he called me and said I could put on the 
     tour if I raised $1million. I pulled it off. I don't take no for 
     answer. I find a way to convince people to come along with me. They 
     want to be persuaded. When I sit in a room with you I'm going to sell

      was a leading force against the closure of the Motion Picture Home's 
     Long Term Care Unit. Daniel served as an activist for the rights of 
     Motion Picture and Television Industry elderly. As a leader in his 
     advocacy for the Motion Picture and Television Fund's fabled Motion 
     Picture Home's Long Term Care unit, Daniel was a critical element in 
     organizing and speaking at several awareness events, fund raisers, 
     and rallies. Daniel's vociferous and focused protection of his mother 
     Rosemary's (and 137 other residents) status of care, led to the 
     overturning of any attempt to close the 'nursing home' that has been 
     home to aged members of the entertainment industry for over 90 years. 
     Daniel worked closely with SAG Hollywood Board members to first gain 
     the support of the Screen Actors Guild Union. Attending most of the 
     2009 and 2010 SAG Hollywood Board meetings, Daniel then spoke on the 
     dais to the SAG National Board members, urging for their support to 
     insure the future of the Long Term Care unit at the MPTF, his words 
     were welcomed to a successful SAG National Board vote to stand by the 
     historic mission in providing a safe haven for Industry members in 
     need of long term care. Daniel then secured the support of the 
     Teamsters Union, to build a powerful Industry pushback on the MPTF's 
     plans to shutter the Long Term Care unit of the Home. Daniel was 
     instrumental in returning the meaning of 'we take care of our own' to 
     the Motion Picture and Television Fund.</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN"> As 
     you can see, Daniel Quinn was a caring and giving person who saw his 
     mother die with dignity in a care facility he fought to keep open. 
     Daniel Quinn was also very involved in stage work and his long-time 
     friend and mentor, actor Paul Sorvino, was instrumental for him 
     getting roles on stage. He was also very good friends with actor John 
     Schneider and they appeared in the streaming series TWENTYSIXMILES 
     together, where they both sing and play instruments. Daniel Quinn 
     died of heart disease. His age is unknown, but my best guess is that

     days and when his girlfriend was hit on by Charlestown mobster 
     Georgie McLaughlin in 1961, it set off the Boston Irish Gang War of 
     the early 1960s. Rocco himself was picked up as a suspect in the 
     murder of Bernie McLaughlin, but never charged. His other credits 
     include starring in the February 3, 2008, Super Bowl ad for Audi that 
     parodied the famous &quot;horse head&quot; scene in THE GODFATHER - 
     1972. Alex Rocco was born on a leap year on February 29, 1936 and

     was a frequent guest on THE CHARLIE ROSE SHOW - 1998-2014. Mr. 
     Doctorow never had a kind word to say about WELCOME TO HARD TIMES 
     [which he said was the second worst film ever made, the first being 
     SWAMP FIRE - 1948], RAGTIME [which he said the first ten minutes were 
     good, but unfortunately it goes on] or DANIEL [which he said was one 
     of the greatest commercial disasters of all time], but being a 
     novelist, he had this perfect prose to say about growing up in the 
     Bronx as a kid: </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;In the dark Bronx 
     days of the Great Depression, I lived on a street named after the 
     brook or burn that once flowed through it. I came down the front 
     steps of my house into a world that was sunny, warm, and clean. 
     Nobody in the neighborhood owned a car, and so the street belonged to 
     the kids. It was our stickball field, our flea market. We flipped 
     pennies against a wall, traded baseball cards, played skelly with soda-bottle
      caps; we opened our hands for the delicate art of box ball, and 
     abandoned ourselves to the wild neighborhood wars of ringolevio. An 
     eminence who lived on our block was a captain in the Sanitation 
     Department, which is why every other day in summer, the water wagon 
     came grinding up the street, spraying from the sides of its tank a 
     beautiful spreading arc of glistening rainbows that seemed ethereally 
     to be herding this beast of a truck like a pair of angels. And when 
     the water wagon turned the corner and was gone, the street was 
     suddenly quiet except for the bubbling rivulets of water running 
     along the guttered curbs, carrying with it our fleets of walnut 
     shells and ice-cream sticks as we scurried along to see how far they 
     would go before running aground.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN"> 
     Beautiful, wouldn't you say? Doctorow also won the Library of 
     Congress Prize for American Fiction&#153; in 2014. E.L. Doctorow

     was made {no animosity involved}, but Piper said that it was Keith 
     who helped him perfect his character of &quot;Nada&quot; in the 
     film.] Pure action/horror film heaven. Roddy acted before then, but 
     people took notice of him for that role and his acting career just 
     took off in B-Films. He was so popular, in fact, that he retired from 
     wrestling for a long period of time until the acting roles dried up 
     [his acting roles started to pick up again after 2005]. Even in his 
     later films, like ALIEN OPPONENT - 2010, there was still a 
     playfulness to him that no one else had. [Just look at that 
     one-on-one fight he had with the girl in the film, especially the 
     ending of the fight, which I am sure was improvised]. My heart is 
     heavy, He beat cancer [successfully beating Hodgkins Lymphoma], he 
     beat opponents in the ring [too many to count], but he just couldn't 
     beat his heart, which gave out on him at the young age of 61 
     years-old [thankfully, in his sleep]. I would like to think if there

     LIVE: </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;You know, when we did it, it 
     was about Reaganomics, but it was also a political statement [about] 
     where our society is headed. Right now, what they're trying to do in 
     society is get rid of all cash money so you just have a chip and 
     everything is on your chip. Well, that's full control. If you go on 
     an airplane right now, they won't take cash anymore. They actually 
     say, &quot;We're a cashless airplane.&quot; Wait a second? You won't 
     take cash? That's &quot;OBEY. This is your God.&quot; I think this 
     movie is a statement of &quot;keep our freedom,&quot; and I believe 
     everybody gets that from it no matter what generation.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN"> 
     I can't describe my feelings right now. He was famous for his dislike 
     of WWE President Vince McMahon and hated that he was cast as a bad 
     guy later in his career. He said so in one of his &quot;Piper's 
     Pit&quot; segments on MONDAY NIGHT RAW and McMahon instantly fired 
     him. There was no one on Earth like Rowdy Roddy and I'm sad to see 
     him drift off this mortal coil. Too many wrestlers are still in the 
     ring way past their prime and there should be some kind of law or 
     Union that forbades it. Roddy was always in great shape [even after 
     battling and beating cancer], but there has to be a connection 
     between his wrestling and his heart attack. Who's next Ric Flair? I 
     will miss Piper, but his legend will live on in all the films and 
     DVDs of his wrestling days, so goodnoght dear man. It was great while 
     it lasted. Roddy Piper was 61 years-old. Now will everyone please 
     send their best vibes and well wishes to </FONT><FONT COLOR="MAROON">Jimmy
      &#147;Superfly&#148; Snuka</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN">, who has been 
     battling stomach cancer? He was an old pal [as well as a WWE {WWF}] 
     opponent who was good friends with Roddy Piper for many, many years 
     [remember the coconut incident?]. The wrestling community was a 
     close-knit one, especially back in the 70's &amp; 80's and it didn't 
     make a difference whether you were a friend or an enemy in the ring. 
     You were usually friends out of the ring. Vince McMahon has made sure 
     that doesn't happen today, which is why I don't watch wrestling 
     anymore. Even though it has always been fake, wrestling is really 
     nothing but acting with violence. There was always a chance of danger 
     that someone could really get hurt and I have seen enough matches in 
     the 80's to see some wrestlers get hurt badly. It does take a toll on 
     your body. Imagine being a stuntman performing 30 stunts every day 
     for 20 years. That is the life of a wrestler and it ends up doing 
     damage. Permanent damage that can't be undone. Yes, Roddy's death hit 
     me hard, but there was no outlet for people like him to get regular 
     medical attention since wrestlers, especially those who don't wrestle 
     anymore, do not have healthcare. Even President Obama's ACA is too 
     expensive for a lot of them, which forces overage and overweight 
     wrestlers to wrestle in high school gymnasiums for $50 a bout. It's a 
     crying shame because I have seen it with my own eyes. Roddy had a SAG 
     card because of his acting, but a lot of former wrestlers will never 
     have that privilege. This is a cause I really feel strongly about. If 
     professional football can finally admit to brain damage caused by 
     concussions on the field and put hundreds on millions of dollars in a 
     fund to help those suffering from permanent brain damage, wrestling 
     can do the same, except injuries are much more varied and extensive. 
     But squeezing money out of Vince McMahon is like trying to squeeze 
     blood from a stone. Remember, he got away scott-free with the 
     Wrestling Steriod<!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/roddy piper photo3 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="110" HEIGHT="121" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="Roddy Piper later in his career." BORDER="0"> 
     Scandal, even though many wrestlers testified that he supplied them 
     with steroids. He got away with wrestlers' deaths because he made 
     them perform dangerous stunts that they didn't really want to do 
     [Remember </FONT><FONT COLOR="MAROON">Owen Hart's</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN">

     first one, actually aired in a TV special; It would take two more 
     years {1971} for the series to finally make it to air and the rest is 
     history {it really was history}. I never laughed or cried so hard 
     during a TV series. The final cast were pitch perfect and full of 
     layers. The episode where Gloria loses her baby still makes me cry 
     like a baby, especially when Archie tries to comfort her. And then 
     there's the Sammy Davis Jr. episode. I don't remember laughing so

     but quit and was replaced by Michael Sarne [a wise choice if you ask 
     me]. In 2003, he won a PGA Award&#153; for a Lifetime Achievement 
     Award in Television. Bud Yorkin was a true pioneer on TV, forming 
     Tandem Production with friend Norman Lear and they always tried to 
     make TV more than a medium for idiots. They managed to make some 
     thought-provoking, hilarious and emotional pieces of TV. Without ALL

     N.Y. He was 88. Becker was a theater critic, a culturally oriented

     for the art of film motivated him at least as much as a desire to 
     make money. Janus, which had been <!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/william j. becker photo small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="130" HEIGHT="121" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="William J. Becker" BORDER="0">founded
      in the 1950s by a pair of Harvard alumni, exposed American 
     moviegoers to the then mostly unfamiliar work of groundbreaking 
     directors such as Italians Federico Fellini and Michelangelo 
     Antonioni; Ingmar Bergman; Frenchmen Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut and 
     Robert Bresson; Luis Bu&ntilde;uel; and Japanese masters Akira 
     Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu and Kenji Mizoguchi. After acquiring the 
     company, Becker and his partner Saul J. Turell secured the rights to 
     an enormous cache of international films, including Jean Renoir&#146;s
      GRAND ILLUSION and Sergei Eisenstein&#146;s BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN as 
     well as key American works like Orson Welles&#146; CITIZEN KANE and 
     the original KING KONG Janus had been a small, financially shaky 
     company; they transformed it to one that&#146;s still prospering by 
     expanding the means of distributing its films, from celluloid to 
     streaming. In 2006 the company celebrated its first half-century by 
     releasing the DVD boxed set 'Essential Art House: 50 Years of Janus 
     Films.' New York Times critic Dave Kehr compared this collection to 
     the 50-volume set of the world&#146;s literary canon selected a 
     century earlier by Harvard president Charles William Eliot. 'Janus 
     Films does not have quite the clout of Harvard,' Mr. Kehr wrote, 'but 
     it says a lot about the central role Janus has played in American 
     film culture that the selections made by a modestly staffed 
     for-profit distribution house have come to assume almost as much 
     canonical authority as Mr. Eliot&#146;s choices.' Arthur William John 
     Becker III was born in St. Louis. He enrolled at Washington 
     University in St. Louis at the age of 15 and began corresponding with 
     Henry Miller, the renegade author of heavily erotic novels such as 
     'Henry and June.' Becker spent some time studying at Duke but 
     graduated from Harvard in 1948 and, as a Rhodes scholar, earned a 
     doctorate at Wadham College, Oxford, penning a thesis on the poet 
     William Butler Yeats. After a stint in the Navy, he became a drama 
     critic for literary journal the Hudson Review in the early 1950s and 
     a partner of Broadway producer and real estate powerhouse Roger L. 
     Stevens, who helped Becker buy the theater magazine Playbill. Becker 
     and Turell, who was securing the rights to films for what became the 
     Walter Reade Organization, bought Janus from its original owners, 
     Cyrus Harvey Jr. and Bryant Haliday, two actors who were programming 
     art films at the Brattle Theater in Cambridge, Mass. They expanded to 
     a Manhattan venue in 1953 and founded Janus three years later. In 
     1957, after screening two films by Fellini, they achieved their first 
     breakthrough hit with Bergman&#146;s THE SEVENTH SEAL By the early 
     1960s, however, Janus was weakening, and the company was sold in 
     1965. During the 1960s and &#145;70s, the new owners vastly expanded 
     Janus&#146; library, which contained only 30 films, securing 
     relationships with foreign distributors and acquiring rights both to 
     experimental films and an array of classics that could be screened 
     together in festivals as a new, younger audience embraced film not 
     merely as entertainment but as art. Janus benefited amid an arthouse 
     revival, the growth in college enrollment and the introduction of an 
     increasing number of university film courses. Later it capitalized on 
     the nascent home video market by releasing its catalog first on laser 
     disc, and then on DVD. It also merged with Voyager, which evolved 
     into the Criterion Collection, and eventually expanded into 
     distribution on cable TV and online. Eventually Becker&#146;s son 
     Peter became president of Criterion. [Turell&#146;s son Jonathan 
     became managing director of Janus and Criterion CEO]. In addition to 
     his son Peter, Becker is survived by his wife, choreographer Patricia 
     Birch; another son, photographer Jonathan; daughter Alison Price

     of Texas - Austin. He did some theater work in college. In the summer 
     of 1973 he heard that Tobe Hooper and others were in town and were

     Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel, the writer of TCM, he got the part of 
     Leatherface the retarded killer. After TCM he tried to make a living 
     as a writer. Gunnar worked as a magazine editor for a while and then

     television career in these years. He was the director of publicity 
     and advertising for the Government of India in their Tourist Office 
     in the U.S. from 1958 to 1960. His performance in the BBC classic 
     GANGSTERS - 1976, as &quot;Rafiq&quot; earned him countrywide 
     recognition in the United Kingdom. This was even though he had acted 
     in Theatres and appeared on television previously in the U.K. During 
     this period he acted in the off-Broadway play &quot;A Tenth of an 
     Inch Make The Difference&quot; written and directed by Rolf Forsberg, 
     who later cast Saeed Jaffrey and his wife Madhur in the noted short 
     films, PARABLE in 1964, and STALKED, starring Jack Hawkins, in 1968. 
     Mr. Jaffrey began his feature film career acting in the movie THE 
     GURU [1969], and since then has made numerous film appearances along 
     with Hollywood stars such as Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Pierce 
     Brosnan etc. He had, since then, worked with directors of high 
     caliber such as Satyajit Ray, James Ivory, David Lean and Richard 
     Attenborough. He was a member of the Actors' Equity Association, 
     Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and 
     Radio Artists. He was known over the world for his impeccable English 
     accent, his dapper style and his catch phrase &quot;My dear boy&quot;.
      They form part of an acting persona that audiences have always found 
     enchanting. He used his smooth charm to good effect whether he is 
     playing the archetypal oily, corrupt businessman or the kindly, 
     knowing, father like figure. He was the first Asian to have received 
     British and Canadian Academy Award nominations for acting, and is the 
     first ever to be awarded the Order of the British Empire for his 
     services to drama. Saeed Jaffrey suffered a brain hemorrhage was 86

     dispute in 1967 between actor Leonard Nimoy and the producers of STAR 
     TREK - 1966-1969, Canary was a strong contender as a replacement for 
     Mr. Spock. He made guest appearances on both of the longest running 
     prime time dramas in US television history: GUNSMOKE and LAW &amp; 
     ORDER. He was also a trained singer. Even though he officially

     he had to say in 2011 about the making of SCARFACE - 1983: </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;We
      rehearsed our Scarface [1983] to the nines. Long period of 
     rehearsal, so that by the time we started to shoot, it was almost 
     like doing a play. We all had a grand time doing it. It was a 
     wonderful cast. We all got along well together, and that's it...The 
     acting talent, the cinematography, we were propelled into a real 
     class action film. Long after I kick the bucket it'll be played.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN"> 
     He also started his career on stage and never gave up working on it, 
     playing Broadway whenever he had the time. He was in the business a 
     staggering 65+years. Robert Loggia passed away due to complications 
     of Alzheimer's disease and was 85 years old. What a loss for both 
     film and theater.) - 12/04/15</FONT></FONT></FONT><BR>

     that celebrates transgendered persons. She went through a whole lot 
     of hell throughout her life because of her choice. Which makes me 
     ask: Why don't people mind their own business and let people be who 
     they want to be? As long as it is within legal paramenters [which 
     trangerderism is], whose business is it? People today make me sick, 
     but I was proud of Holly Woodlawn, warts and all, for staying the 
     course. She appeared in dozens of documentaries about Andy Warhol, 
     his acting entourage and even herself. She use to be one of a kind, 
     but now transgendered people are coming out more in the open and 
     being accepted by most people. To those who don't, I have one thing 
     to say to you: Shame, shame, shame. Your Bible says to treat everyone 
     the same, but it's apparent you ignore that part as you spit out your 
     bile. Look in the mirror and see the real evil one. The legendary Lou 
     Reed song &quot;Take a Walk on the Wild Side&quot; refers to Holly, 
     indelibly imprinting her story in American pop culture. &quot;Holly 
     Came From Miami, F-L-A...&quot; are the beginning lyrics forever 
     describing Holly's arrival in New York City and ultimate imprint on 
     the landscape of 1970s chique. My favorite Woodlawn quote is this: </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;If

     Ceylon tomorrow and live among the fishermen. I make a living without 
     having a job; I don't cater to anybody. I believe that's the hardest

     independence, any kind of freedom. So, I'm very, very proud of the

     Produced the TV Movies PERFECT WITNESS - 1989; NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS 
     - 1996; and MONEY PLAY$ - 1998. Wayne Rogers turned down the role 
     [Pernell Roberts took it] in the TV series TRAPPER JOHN M.D. 
     [1979-1986] because he didn't want to play a doctor on TV again, but 
     that's exactly what he did when he starred in the series HOUSE CALLS. 
     Both series made their debut the same year. Wayne Rogers made 
     millions of dollars being a business and financial advisor an would 
     show up frequently on financial shows on cable stations up to the 
     week he passed away. He didn't squander his earnings as an actor, but 
     instead turned it into a valuable business portfolio. Not bad for a 
     guy who's half-responsible for THE ASTRO ZOMBIES! He got his Star in 
     the Walk Of Fame on December 13, 2005 at 7018 Hollywood Blvd.. He 
     never once said that he regretted leaving M*A*S*H and said so in many 
     documentaries about the ground-breaking series. He had a life-long 
     financial plan with his quality of life and his family's and he got 
     to see it come to fruition. How many other people can say that? Wayne 
     Rogers was battling pneumonia and was 82 years-old. The next-to- last 
     celebrity to die in the dreaded year of 2015. And it would have to be
