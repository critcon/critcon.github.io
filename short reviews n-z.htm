    GUN MASSACRE</A><A NAME="Nail Gun Massacre"></A> (1985) - </B>The 
   tag line to this crappy film is &quot;It's Cheaper Than A 
   Chainsaw!&quot;. <B><A HREF="nail_gun_massacre.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nail gun massacre vhs small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="112" HEIGHT="194" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A></B>My
    God, it's cheaper than the change in my pocket! After a girl is gang 
   raped by a bunch of construction workers, a fatigue-wearing helmeted 
   killer driving a beige hearse begins killing construction workers and 
   their girlfriends with an air-powered nail gun. The unknown killer 
   talks in an electronically-altered voice and cracks wise every time a 
   killing is performed. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure 
   out who the killer is, but half the fun in watching this film is 
   spotting the constant gaffes, boom mikes, flubbed line readings and 
   cheap cost-cutting. The sheriff drives a regular car with no markings 
   or police lights (and no, it's not an unmarked car!). His badge and 
   gun also switch sides at various times. When one person is killed and 
   lands on a gas grill, it's very apparent than when he starts to fall 
   over you can see him steady himself with his hand against a fence. 
   When the killer is finally dispatched by falling off a crane, it's 
   plain to see him landing on mats for what the filmmakers thought was 
   beneath camera range. It's also clear to see that a woman is playing 
   the killer throughout the film, so when the killer is unmasked and it 
   turns out to be a man, it's either a cheat or the killer actually got 
   away. It's never explained. Though the killings are bloody and some 
   are creative, such as when one man has his crotch nailed after taking 
   a leak and pissing on the killer, it's all done very cheaply and with 
   a bunch of non-pros pleading for their lives. The dead bodies can 
   plainly be seen breathing while the sheriff and the doctor examine 
   their bodies, and who wouldn't be suspicious of a helmeted person 
   seen driving a hearse? The sheriff spots the hearse on the side of 
   the road and simply dismisses it as an abandoned car and drives off! 
   You have to love films like this for their sheer audacity in thinking 
   audiences are as stupid as the characters in the film. It took two 
   directors, Terry Lofton (who also did the effects) and Bill Leslie, 
   to make this one and, surprise!, it's their only credit to date.

   (1966) territory. This is just a small portion of the film as there 
   are many subplots to deal with. One subplot is about a local 
   policeman with a huge drinking problem. He is assigned to the 
   rancher&#146;s case (which also includes some mysterious murders of 
   Aborigines) and has a one night stand with the rancher&#146;s 
   sexually frustrated wife (Rebecca Gilling). Throw in some mysticism, 
   sexual tension, a cave of the dead and more impalements than a visit 
   to an acupuncturist and you have what is undoubtedly the most 
   unclassifiable film to be released on video in many a year. 
   Recommended for many reasons, especially for the realistic 
   transformation of the rancher from an unloving dirty bastard to a 
   truly sympathetic character. Starring John Stanton, John Jarratt and

    ray gun and sharp teeth and claws. There's also couple of subplots 
   dealing with a criminal and a wife-beater, but it's the alien plot 
   that steals the show. There's gore a-plenty as limbs are torn off, 
   intestines are ripped out, faces are mutilated and other bloody 
   mayhem is on view. This is by far Dohler's bloodiest and most 
   family-unfriendly film as copious nudity is also present. It's as if 
   Dohler threw caution to the wind and made an 80's-styled gore-a-thon 
   and that's this film's only saving grace as the acting is abysmal (as 
   usual), the film stock changes from scene to scene, and some (but not 
   all) of the effects are of the grade school level. Some of the gore 
   is actually quite effective as faces are ripped apart with their 
   eyeballs hanging out and other body organs are removed in a way that 
   no doctor would approve. The scene of the two cops making love will 
   have you howling with laughter (&quot;Let's get those pants off!&quot;
    and &quot;Mind if I take this shirt off? Only if I can take this 
   towel off.&quot;). Lets just say that Dohler lets everything rip in

    CALLER</A><A NAME="NightCaller1985"></A> (1985) -</B> Here's 
   something you don't see often: a Hong Kong Giallo film styled in the 
   way of Dario Argento. But unlike Argento, this film veers off into a 
   different direction two-thirds into the film and becomes a torture 
   porn flick. The film opens with mother Jessica (Terry Hu) making 
   dinner for her young daughter Edith (Pui Wai Lee) a few days before 
   Christmas. Also in the room is a mysterious person dressed in full 
   Giallo regalia - black trenchcoat, black gloves and a big floppy 
   black hat. This person grabs a big butcher knife and begins slashing 
   Jessica all over her body, as she tries to run away. Edith watches in 
   horror. grabs her favorite doll and hides in her bedroom closet. 
   While all this is happening, a group of Christmas carolers, all young 
   children, are singing<A HREF="night_caller_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/night caller 1985 vhs front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="187" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   'Silent Night' into Jessica's apartment camera, unaware that they are 
   singing to a vicious murder. The killer keeps slashing Jessica until 
   she crashes through a window in her apartment, yet she is still not 
   dead. The killer then stops slashing and begins stabbing Jessice 
   until she dies, her final words being the killer's name, 
   &quot;Bobby&quot;. The killer then goes into Edith's bedroom to kill 
   the young child and when Edith's doll begins talking, it looks like 
   it's curtains for the young girl, but some noise outside forces the 
   killer to quickly exit the apartment, running into a young female 
   caroler and the apartment's one-eyed manager, neither who see the 
   killer's face.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When the police arrive, including Inspector James Wong (producer 
   Melvin Wong; <B><A HREF="heart_of_dragon_1985.htm">HEART OF DRAGON</A></B> 
   - 1985), they find Edith hiding in her bedroom closet and in a state 
   of shock, unable to talk and traumatized like no young child should 
   ever be. Arriving late to the crime scene is Inspector Wong's best 
   friend, Inspector Steve Chan (director/screenwriter Philip Chan; <B><A HREF="hard_boiled_1993.htm">HARD
    BOILED</A></B> - 1993), a no-nonsene cop who doesn't suffer fools 
   gladly and is prone to ultra-violence (we see him beating up a 
   motorcycle gang who are attacking&nbsp; a fish and chips shop, using 
   an illegal spring-loaded metal baton to stop the punks from hurting 
   the elderly shop owner and his daughter (lots of baton hits to the 
   crotch region, even for the women bikers!). Also joining the case is wet-behind-the-ears
    female novice Inspector Porky (Pat Ha, who is not porky, but 
   actually very pretty), who interviews the apartment manager, telling 
   him he must have seen something, so he pulls his glass eye out of its 
   socket and shows her that he has only one good eye and didn't see the 
   killer with it!&nbsp; James brings Edith to the police station, where 
   her unfeeling biological father tells James that he was never close 
   to his daughter (he and Jessica are separated) and that he doesn't 
   want Edith and will put her in an orphanage. James decides &quot;Fuck 
   that&quot; and takes Edith home with him. James and his wife Kiki 
   (Deborah Sims) always wanted a child, but Kiki was never able to get 
   pregnant, so a somewhat reluctant Kiki welcomes Edith to the family. 
   Will Edith begin to talk and tell James who killed her mother? If 
   things were only that easy.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    James, Steve and Porky begin their investigation, first interviewing 
   the photographer of Jessica's modeling agency, Tak Ho (Stuart Ong; 
   real name: Sai-Kit Yung; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EvilCat">EVIL CAT</A></B> 
   - 1986). He has a criminal record for sexually assaulting young 
   females, so they all keep a close eye on him. When they leave, Tak Ho 
   phones the real killer and says if he doesn't get a large sum of 
   blackmail money, he will turn the killer in to the police. 
   Unfortunately, Tak Ho is murdered by the killer as he watches a live 
   televised fashion show from the overhead metal scaffolding. He is 
   stabbed and tossed off the scaffolding by the killer and everyone 
   watching the show on TV thinks Tak Ho's death is part of the show! 
   Things take a turn when James discovers that Edith's doll has a 
   cassette recorder inside it and it recorded Jessica's murder. He 
   begins to search for a killer named Bobby, but he is unable to get in 
   contact with Steve or Porky to tell them the news.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This is when the film switches from Giallo to Torture Porn. Bobby, 
   it turns out, is a bisexual woman (portrayed by Pauline Wong; real 
   name: Siu-Fung Wong) and she, along with her obviously psychotic 
   unnamed sidekick (Kei Mai; <B><A HREF="were_going_to_eat_you_1980.htm">WE'RE
    GOING TO EAT YOU</A></B> - 1980), kidnap James and chain him up in a 
   room, where they torture him relentlessly. Bobby and Jessica were 
   once lesbian lovers for more than a year, but the relationship 
   changed for the worse when Jessica wanted to reconnect with her 
   husband and Bobby went crazy, killing everyone associated with 
   Jessica. James almost escapes on a couple of occasions, but Bobby 
   always manages to catch him and torture him more. Steve, who 
   interviewed Bobby just before she kidnapped James, has no idea where 
   James is, as he has been missing for a couple of days, so he breaks 
   police protocol and, without telling his superior (Hoi-Tin Ng), 
   offers a $50,000 reward for information leading to James. Kiki is 
   especially worried, as it is not like her husband not to call her 
   several times a day. When James' car is discovered all burned and a 
   crisp cadaver is inside the car, everyone, including Kiki, thinks 
   James is dead, but the police coroner makes an important discovery 
   that the corpse only had one good eye, which rules out James (It's 
   the body of the apartment manager). Steve picks up a clue from a 
   stoolie (after shoving his head into a shit-filled toilet!) that 
   leads him to Bobby, which turns into a violent and bloody shoot-out, 
   where Bobby and her sidekick are killed (although Bobby is one tough 
   chick, telling Steve that she gave James an overdose of drugs by 
   injecting him with it before she finally dies). Steve and Porky rush 
   James to the hospital, where they, along with Kiki and Edith, watch 
   James die. As they are walking away, Edith pulls away from Kiki and 
   runs into James' hospital room, shaking his corpse and saying out 
   loud that it is not James' time to die, he is now part of her family. 
   Want to know what happens next? I'm not gonna tell!.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    translation title only used on French materials), is a pretty good 
   giallo film, but when it veers into torture porn territory (a genre I 
   usually hate), I thought it would ruin the whole experience for me, 
   but, strangely, it didn't. I guess the word &quot;strange&quot; aptly 
   describes what happens during the final half-hour of the film, as 
   Bobby tortures James by punching him over and over and her sidekick 
   joins in. Let's talk about her sidekick for a second. When he's not 
   singing and dancing to Toni Basil's &quot;Mickey&quot; or is in 
   blackface while quoting &quot;You talkin' to me?&quot; from <B><A HREF="taxi_driver_1976.htm">TAXI
    DRIVER</A></B> (1976), he's about as crazy as a person can be and 
   still be called human. It's an unusual performance of a person 
   without any morals and it works quite well. Of course, since this is 
   a Hong Kong flick, expect lots of comic moments. While a lot of these 
   moments don't work (Such as James giving Steve a joke Christmas 
   present, a box of rubbers, before giving him his real present, 
   telling him not to open it until Christmas), some of it works quite 
   well, such as the apartment manager pulling out his glass eye and 
   showing Porky it. Actually nearly everything in this film gels quite 
   well, winning awards in the Hong Kong Film Awards; a nomination for 
   Pauline Wong's portrayal as Bobby and a win for Suk Yuen Luk's Art 
   Direction, which looks just like a Dario Argento film, full of 
   gel-lighting and primary colors, especially Jessica's murder, which 
   is a thing of brutal beauty. It's obvious that director/writer/star 
   Philip Chan loves Giallo films and wanted one on his resum&eacute;. 
   He does a great job of creating a world surrounded by color and 
   danger at every turn. If you are on the fence about Hong Kong 
   mysteries, give this one a chance. I bet you'll love it. It's not 
   overly bloody or violent because the film doesn't really need it, but 
   there are some scenes that will make you flinch.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   be damned if I can find one DVD release, even on DVD-R from gray 
   market sites. I saw this streaming on YouTube thanks to channel 
   &quot;Giallo Realm&quot;, who offer a nice widescreen print subtitled

   (the U.S. tape is on the Rainbow VHS label [I know, I never heard of

   violin case hopping onto a gondola and going through the canals of 
   Venice, Italy until she reaches home. She begins practicing the 
   violin using sheet music from Paganini's song &quot;The Witch's 
   Curse&quot;, while her mother (Elena Pompei) takes a bath. After she 
   is done playing the violin, the young girl goes into the bathroom 
   carrying a very ugly doll and dunks its head in her mother's bath 
   water. The young girl then turns on a blow dryer to dry the doll's 
   hair, but she throws it into the bath water instead and watches as 
   her mother is electrocuted, her face and body being burned beyond 
   recognition, the young girl smiling.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We are then in the present, as we watch a nameless three girl band 
   perform their newest song in a recording studio. Their bitch of a 
   producer, Lavinia (Maria Cristina Mastrangeli), hates the song (I 
   happened to like it; it sounds almost like Bon Jovi's &quot;You Give 
   Love A Bad Name&quot;) and tells lead singer/violinist Kate (Jasmine 
   Maimone; <B><A HREF="action.htm#MagnumCop1978">MAGNUM COP</A></B> - 
   1978) that she needs to write another hit, not a song that sounds 
   like all their others. Kate tells Lavinia that she can't write 
   another hit all the time, it's not as easy as she makes it out to be, 
   so Lavinia tells her to hire someone else to write a hit song. 
   Guitarist Elena (Michel Klippstein) and bass player Rita (Luana 
   Ravegnini) are on Kate's side, but studio musician Daniel (Pascal 
   Persiano; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#VoicesFromBeyond91">VOICES
    FROM BEYOND</A></B> - 1991), who was playing drums on the song we 
   just heard, has an idea on how to get his hands on a hit song. He 
   delivers a gym bag full of cash to someone named Mr. Pickett (Donald 
   Pleasence; <B><A HREF="#Specters1987">SPECTERS</A></B> - 1987), who 
   is sitting in the ruins of what looks like a factory. When Mr. 
   Pickett gets the cash, he hands Daniel a locked briefcase (He tells 
   Daniel that the combination to both locks are 6-6-6. Yes, that's 
   groan-inducing, but just go with it) that contains a sealed scroll 
   that's an unpublished song by Paganini titled &quot;Paganini 
   Horror&quot; (It's best not to ask how Daniel obtained so much money 
   or even knew about all this. Just go with it). It is said that 
   Paganini sold his soul to the Devil to become a world class violinist 
   and when Daniel breaks Paganini's seal on the scroll, we know nothing 
   good can come from it. We later see Mr. Pickett climb a bell tower 
   and throw the cash from the gym bag into the air, as the cash rains 
   down from above, Mr. Pickett calling them &quot;Little Demons&quot; 
   (money is the root of all evil, after all).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Daniel then plays the unpublished Paganini song on piano for Lavinia 
   and Kate and they both love it. Lavinia also wants to make a music 
   video of the song, so she comes up with the idea of shooting a horror 
   music video (&quot;Like Michael Jackson's Thriller!&quot;) in a 
   creepy house and hiring well-known horror director Mark Singer 
   (Pietro Genuardi; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#HellsGate1989">THE
    HELL'S GATE</A></B> - 1989) to direct it. Lavinia rents a creepy 
   house from owner Sylvia Hackett (the late <A HREF="index.htm#DariaNicolodi">Daria
    Nicolodi</A>; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DeepRed1975">DEEP RED</A></B> 
   - 1975; who co-wrote the screenplay with Cozzi) and we watch the 
   music video being made, as Kate plays a woman in a white ball gown 
   who is attacked by Paganini (played by Daniel), who is wearing a 
   weird metal mask and wearing 18th Century clothes. He stabs Kate in 
   the chest over and over with a gold dagger with a musical note for a 
   handle until Kate &quot;dies&quot;, her blood spraying all over the 
   wall.&nbsp; Director Mark yells &quot;Cut!&quot; and before you know 
   it, horrific things begin to happen. The real Paganini (who has a 
   golden violin with a hidden blade) appears and kills Rita with his 
   sharp musical instrument of death. Daniel is turned into a pile of 
   ash when he enters a mysterious room full of satanic symbols on the 
   walls and a huge sand-filled hourglass in the corner. When the rest 
   can't find Rita or Daniel, they think they have left the house 
   together (Now why would they think that when Daniel showed no 
   interest in Rita? Just go along with it). While searching for Daniel 
   and Rita, Sylvia discovers a body made of ash in the satanic room and 
   has Kate, Lavinia, Elena and Mark come into the room, telling them 
   that the body made of ash has Daniel's ring in it. Then, a hole opens 
   up in the floor and Kate falls into it, Mark tries to lift her out of 
   the hole, but his hand and arm is burned badly when awful optical 
   lightning (or electricity; it looks exactly like the young girl's 
   mother's death [and there's a reason for that]) hits his hand and 
   arm, forcing Mark to let go of Kate. Lavinia decides to go down the 
   hole to search for Kate, as she spots a tunnel down there that Kate 
   could have used to try to escape. While Lavinia is searching the 
   tunnel for Kate, Elena finds Kate in the house's drained pool, Kate 
   not knowing how she got there. Elena and Mark decide to leave the 
   house in Mark's car, but when they drive off, the car hits an 
   invisible wall of electricity and Mark goes through the windshield 
   and Elena is thrown from the car, as it explodes and Mark burns to 
   death, as he is now lying on the hood of the car.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Elena and Lavinia are also murdered later on and only Kate and 
   Sylvia are left, a car pulls up to the house and Mr. Pickett exits 
   from it. He tells Kate that he's the Devil and Sylvia was the little 
   girl from the beginning of the film who killed her mother, so he 
   decided to make the house a &quot;Living Hell&quot; for Sylvia, as 
   she has to watch people who rent her house die horribly because they 
   were despicable people to begin with, souls that even God wouldn't 
   take. A new group of people arrive to the house and Mr. Pickett says 
   that they are also all bad people except for the little girl with 
   them (&quot;I may let her live&quot;, says Pickett). Kate says that 
   she is still alive, therefore she is ready to leave, but Mr. 
   Pickett/Satan pulls out the gold dagger from his briefcase and stabs 
   Kate in the chest, killing her, while Sylvia welcomes her new 
   tenants, who have no idea the Hell they are about to be put through. <FONT COLOR="NAVY">THE

    be, it glides along at a quick pace, even with the mountainous holes 
   in the plot. It has several scenes of bloody gore, mostly the dagger 
   entering bodies and spraying blood all over the place. There's a 
   scene where the survivors follow a trail of strange-looking&nbsp; 
   blood (it looks like ketchup and mustard) and find the dead body of 
   Elena, who is covered in some strange mold. Lavinia says she knows 
   what the mold is, it's an ancient wood mold that destroyed trees 
   which she saw when watching on a TV documentary! Filled with mindless 
   dialogue like this, how can you hate this film? There's also a very 
   gory scene where Livinia is killed. She is trapped behind an 
   invisible shield and a wall, as the shield moves towards her, 
   crushing her head and popping it like a bloody grape. What more could 
   you ask for? It's an enjoyable romp that uses bastardized history to 
   tell a horror story. I know my friend Steven would be looking for 
   Cozzi's patented &quot;Disco Space&quot; scene (Read Steven's review 
   of Cozzi's <B><A HREF="adventures_of_hercules_1985.htm">THE 
   ADVENTURES OF HERCULES PART 2</A></B> [1985] <A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#AdventHercules1985">HERE</A>),
    but he won't find any of that here, even though Cozzi wanted to make 
   this film more sci-fi oriented&nbsp; and the original cut of the film 
   was eight minutes longer than the release version, but Producer 
   Fabrizio De Angelis (The director of the <B><A HREF="thunder_warrior_series_1983-1988.htm">THUNDER</A></B> 
   and <B><A HREF="karate_warrior_sequels_1988-1993.htm">KARATE WARRIOR</A></B> 
   franchises) made him edit out those scenes to make the film more 
   horror oriented. I know Steven would love to see those missing eight 
   minutes and so would I. Hey, this film is not going to win any 
   awards, but it does more than enough to make sure you are 
   entertained. Just go with it and you'll have a good time.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This film never had a theatrical or VHS release in the United

   review is based on the <A HREF="paganini_horror_1989.htm#SeverinDVD">DVD</A>).
    The picture quality is superb and the colors pop off the screen. 
   Like most Severin releases, there are copious extras, such as new 
   interviews with Cozzi and actor Pascal Persiano, as well as deleted 
   scenes and an alternate ending (Sorry Steven, no Disco Space!). It is 
   also available for free streaming on YouTube on channel &quot;Kings 
   Of Horror&quot; (it looks like a port of the Severin print). Also 
   available streaming on Amazon Prime Video, but you'll have to pay 
   $2.99 to watch it if you are a member. Whether it is worth it or not 
   depends on how you feel about Cozzi's other films. Me? I like most of 
   them and Cozzi played a very important part in the history of Italian 
   genre films, more than most people will ever realize. He is still 
   making films up to this day. Also featuring Roberto Giannini and

    is badly acted, looks like it was edited with a hacksaw and contains 
   the worst music soundtrack in recent memory, it is so loony, 
   nonsensical and colorful that it transcends a normal viewing 
   experience. A series of brutal murders take place in the vicinity of 
   Blackwood Sanitarium, located in the middle of the Nevada desert. 
   This nut bin is run by the demented Dr. Arthur Blackwood (Bill Greer, 
   who also wrote the screenplay), who believes that all evil must be 
   cast out of the body by what ever means possible. When his patients 
   misbehave, Dr. Blackwood tortures and kills them using guillotines, 
   whips and, in one instance, locking one patient in a coffin with a 
   poisonous snake. When notified by one of his nurses that a patient he 
   has tortured is dead, the good doctor replies &quot;Death is a 
   fabrication of the mind!&quot; The doc has a retarded sister (Lynn 
   Marta) who keeps one of his experiments (&quot;The total 
   personification of evil!&quot;) locked in a nearby cave. She lets 
   this thing (all the viewer is able to see are it's red tentacles) out 
   at various times to dispose of nosey policemen and necking teenagers. 
   Things come to a boil when Dr. Blackwood's wife Diane (Deedy Peters) 
   comes for a visit and becomes suspicious of hubby. This wacky horror 
   film, which contains plenty of fake blood and no nudity (the women 
   wear bras and panties when tortured), would make a great double bill

   It opens with the Pope talking to a large crowd at the Vatican, 
   stating that the Devil is real and he is here now. His speech is 
   intercut with a teen named Peter (Jean-Claude Vern&egrave;) tied to 
   the bed and spitting out foul language. We are then taken back to 
   1723, as we watch a satanic cult trying to raise the Devil. A naked 
   woman (Mimma Monticelli) is lying on an altar, while the cult leader 
   (Franco Garofalo) tries to get the Devil to possess her soul. He 
   succeeds, and the woman becomes a Succubus, with the cult stripping 
   naked and having an orgy to welcome the Dark One. An old woman leads 
   a female virgin named Anna to the altar, she passes out and the 
   Succubus climbs on her and gets her pregnant.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then cut back to the present, where Peter is still tied to the 
   bed. His doctor tells Peter's sister, Elena (Patrizia Gori) that he 
   wants to commit her brother to an insane asylum, but Elena says no 
   because she once <A HREF="possessor_1975.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/possessor vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>worked
    at an asylum (a flashback to an asylum where all the women act 
   crazy) and she does not want her brother to be put in such a place. 
   Elena then goes to Connfessional, where she tells the priest (Filippo 
   Perego) how Peter got this way. A long flashback shows us Peter, an 
   archeology student, walking through the woods, when he spots the 
   Succubus stark naked next to a waterfall. He takes photos of the 
   demon woman, but when he has the negatives developed, she is not in 
   any of the photos. He goes back to the waterfall and finds a 
   medallion in the water with the word &quot;Tahal&quot; on it. he 
   makes the medallion into a necklace and puts it around his neck 
   (calling it his &quot;good luck charm&quot;). Bad things begin to 
   happen. At his girlfriend Sherry's (Sonia Viviani) coming-out party, 
   Peter grabs a bottle of champagne and the cork pops off it, spilling 
   champagne on Sherry's new dress and she runs out of the house from 
   embarassment. While Sherry is at a disco, Peter sees the Succubus in 
   his bedroom. She is feeling herself between her legs and entices 
   Peter to join her. Peter grabs a letter opener and slits the 
   Succubus' throat, only instead of the demon woman dying, Sherry drops 
   dead on the disco dance floor, her throat cut. Then Peter enters his 
   mother's (Fran&ccedil;oise Pr&eacute;vost) room totally naked, but he 
   looks like the Succubus. She tosses Mom down the stairs, killing her, 
   only it is now Peter at the top of the stairs. Peter is tested in a 
   hospital, but all the results are negative (sound familiar?) The 
   Succubus visits Elena in her room (saying to her, &quot;You bitch in 
   heat!&quot;) and tears off her headpiece, revealing that Elena's head 
   is shaved (when she looks in the mirror, we discover that it isn't 
   the only place that is shaved!). It all turns out to be a nightmare 
   (or is it?). Elena goes into Peter's bedroom, where he is tied to the 
   bed, which begins spinning on its own (we are getting dangerously 
   close to plagiarism!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    To make a long story short, we cut back to the present day and the 
   priest calls in an exorcist (Richard Conte; <B><A HREF="action.htm#ViolentProfession73">THE
    VIOLENT PROFESSIONALS</A></B> - 1973; in his final acting role). The 
   possessed Peter knows he is coming, shouting out obscenities when he 
   stops outside the house (OK, now it is plagiarism!). After about five 
   minutes of the exorcist speaking Bible verses and Peter spitting up a 
   gallon of blood, Peter is cured. Elena, who may now be possessed, 
   jumps off a cliff and dies. We then see a young boy by the waterfall 
   pick up the medallion (Tahal is the name of the son of Satan) and his 
   eyes look possessed. Ah, the circle of possession!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The film deals with Vincent Omen (Tomas Arana; Bava's <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#BodyPuzzle1992">BODY

   original title of this film was <B><A HREF="prince_of_terror_1988.htm">IL

   film, but he stops it in mid-scene, telling his Producer (Pascal 
   Druant; Lucio Fulci's <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Demonia1990">DEMONIA</A></B>

   everything she reads. One thing the journalist does discover is that 
   Vincent is an excellent golfer (which will come in handy during the

   house and Vincent's missing golf ball comes shooting through the air 
   and breaks a gravy boat. Everyone thinks it is one of Vincent's movie 
   tricks and thank him for the show as they leave, but Vincent tells 
   his wife that he had nothing to do with it, this is the golf ball 
   that ended up missing today (it has &quot;666&quot; stamped on it, 
   Vincent's trademark). Soon, things start going to Hell (literally) in 
   Vincent's house. First, the toilet becomes backed-up and begins 
   overflowing a blood-like substance all over the bathroom floor. When 
   Vincent goes to unclog the toilet, he discovers one of Paul's horror 
   scripts has been shoved down the toilet causing it to overflow. Demon 
   goes missing and Susan can't find him, but as she is lying in bed, 
   she sees Demon lying down next to her stuffed animals. She goes to <A HREF="prince_of_terror_1988_skinned_puppy_gif.htm">pick
    Demon up, but soon discovers that he has been skinned alive</A> (!) 
   and screams. This is when the film quickly falls apart. Betty tells 
   Vincent to go to the guard station at the entrance of their gated 
   community to tell the security guard what has happened, but Vincent 
   says he doesn't want to leave her and Susan alone. Couldn't he have 
   called the guard station and reported it? How about calling the 
   police? Or going to a neighbor's house? Vincent soon gets threatening 
   phone calls and then a visit by a masked intruder, who holds them 
   hostage in their own home, threatening the daughter with rape. Then 
   Paul shows up and shoots the masked intruder, seemingly saving 
   Vincent's family. It all turns out to be a trick orchestrated by 
   Paul. The masked intruder is a crazed bit actor named Eddie Felsen 
   (Ulisse Minervini; Dario Argento's <B><A HREF="card_player_2004.htm">THE
    CARD PLAYER</A></B> - 2004), who is working with Paul and they both 
   terrorize Vincent and his family. The security guard (Augusto 
   Poderosi) shows up and his rib cage shoots out of his chest 
   (stop-motion gore effects by Sergio Stivaletti; <B><A HREF="three_faces_of_terror_2004.htm">THE
    THREE FACES OF TERROR</A></B> - 2004). It turns out the security 
   guard is nothing but a robot Paul controls with a remote control! OK, 
   now this is getting ridiculous! After seemingly cutting off Betty's 
   head with a chainsaw and walling-in Susan in the basement, Vincent 
   comes to the rescue with his golf clubs and balls, every swing a 
   direct hit. He kills Eddie by planting a golf ball directly in his 
   right eye (!) as he is holding Betty hostage, a butcher knife to her 
   throat. He then cripples Paul with golf balls (using some very unique 
   trick shots against the wall!), graphically breaking his wrist and 
   making him immobile. He then reveals to Paul that he is the Devil (!) 
   and tells him that he will leave him in this house, as his own 
   private Hell. We then see Eddie spitting out golf balls out of his 
   mouth in rapid-fire fashion (quite funny, but it is purely 
   unintentional), as Paul is belted with hundreds of golf balls. Even 
   the skinned Demon, who is in a plastic bag, comes to life, leaving 
   Paul to ponder for all eternity the bad he has done. THE END.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Not only is this film unintentionally hilarious, it is full of 
   mind-numbing scenes of unbelievability, especially the robot&nbsp; 
   and skinned dog. If I found a skinned dog in my home, I would put my 
   family in the car and drive away to the nearest police station, but 
   since Vincent reveals himself to be Satan in the finale, we are 
   supposed to suspend belief and go along for the ride. I will give 
   this film some credit for not being boring, but if it is common sense 
   you are looking for, look somewhere else, because you will find none 
   of that here. Tomas Arana (Michele Soavi's <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Church1989">THE

   - 1991) is very good as Vincent, who plays a poor man's version of 
   Dario Argento, but the screenplay to this film is akin to Vincent's 
   feelings for the fictictious film he is shooting. It sucks. For a TV 
   movie, it is full of foul language (&quot;Fuck&quot; is said more 
   than several times) and graphic violence, including Paul's broken 
   wrist (where the bone juts out of the skin) and the hilarious opening 
   of Vincent's new film he is shooting in the beginning of this film, 
   where a corpse is in a tub of water and bloats up to become a monster 
   zombie in a fat suit! I really wanted to slam this film, but because 
   of all the unbelievable situations and the way people react to them, 
   I just can't. I'm not recommending this film, either. All I can say 
   is watch this film and make up your own mind. I originally viewed 
   this on streaming Roku channel B-Movie TV in a nice anamorphic 
   widescreen print dubbed in English, but you can catch it streaming on 
   YouTube from user &quot;Nathaniel Ketcham&quot;. Unfortunately, it is 
   a fullscreen print, but beggars can't be choosers, as there has been

    film's stars, and found it entertaining in a goofy sort of way. 
   Unfortunately, this film drags on much too long for its own good. 
   Video camera fanatic Shep (Dan Merriman) finds a 135 year-old 
   videotape (!) which shows a mad doctor's attempt to bridge dimensions 
   using a machine that he designed. It ended very badly. Shep, with the 
   help of his friends Dave (Rob Monkiewicz), Heather (Diane DeGregorio) 
   and Kim (Irene Joseph), search out the doctor's lab and find the 
   machine. Shep fixes the machine and bridges the dimensions, bringing 
   fist-sized bugs to our dimension which invade our bodies, hatch 
   little ones which bore into our brains (good effect) and cause us to 
   become homicidal maniacs. Poor Shep also ends up having his video 
   camera embedded into his skull thanks to an electrical overload 
   administered to the machine. The rest of the film details Shep's 
   friends trying to avoid Shep and the bugs, who burrow into a cemetery 
   and reanimate some corpses. This may sound exciting but it takes 
   forever to get to the build-up and when it does it fall apart very 
   quickly. I like that Piper animates the bugs by using stop-motion 
   photography and not by CGI. It gives the film an old-time feel 
   severely lacking from most films today. It's just that the acting and 
   plot leave a lot to be desired. A valiant try but a failure. Also 
   starring Liz Hurley (no, not that one), Phip Barbour, Jim Baker and 
   Gordon Gauntlett. Other Brett Piper films include the infamous <B><A HREF="raiders_living_dead_1985.htm">RAIDERS

   disowned this film upon its' release. If you can forget these two 
   things you will probably enjoy this unconventional 
   monster-on-the-loose flick with a real nasty streak. An Irish farmer, 
   while trying to remove a stone pillar from his field, accidentally 
   releases the title creature from a long imprisonment. A vacationing 
   photographer (the late David Dukes) and his family try to convince 
   the local authorities that the creature does exist, but to no avail. 
   Meanwhile, while photographing the inside of an old church, Mr. Dukes 
   learns the truth about the legend of RawHead Rex. The police finally 
   believe his story after one of his children is brutally murdered by 
   the creature. What makes this film different from others of its like 
   is the eerie atmospheric photography and general mean-spiritedness. 
   This film is steeped in local Irish color and contains some truly 
   offbeat characters. There's a local priest who wants to help RawHead 
   Rex and is not above murdering people and spewing filthy language. 
   RawHead urinates on the priest while he begs for more! This and many 
   other scenes (including a beheading, a gutting and other gory scenes) 
   deter you from the fact that the story line is very thin. Forget the 
   story (and the rather weak ending featuring some bad optical work) 
   and just feast your eyes on the screen. You'll have a bloody good 
   time (and RawHead Rex is a sight to behold). Director George Pavlou

   This flick is about as exciting as an apple-picking contest. It's 
   indifferently acted by a bunch of amateur and semi-pro actors. I'm 
   still trying to figure out which is worse: Rick Jordan the actor or 
   Rick Jordan the director? It's also poorly written (by Rick's brother 
   Matt Jordan) and deadly dull. The only good thing this film has to 
   offer is a running joke about how bad Jesse smells. Toss in some bad 
   digital effects and some poor make-up effects and what you have is a 
   film that has a distinct odor to it. It reeks worse than Jesse. A 
   Spartan Home Entertainment Release. <B>Rated R</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

   electricity is the answer this time. The whole film is played so

   horror in it, which is surprising since he also directed the 
   underrated horror gem <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#ShockWaves1976">SHOCK
    WAVES</A></B> (1976). Since all of the effects (which are swell) are 
   used for comic effect, this film gets away with much more violence 
   than straight horror films that are rated R. There are scenes with 
   zombies being blown in half with a shotgun, jaws being ripped-out, 
   various body parts being yanked-off and eaten and more brains being

    &quot;Famous scene where Rane's hand is put into garbage disposal 
   was originally lot more graphic. There was originally shot of his 
   hand getting destroyed. Scene was filmed with fake hand and lamb 
   shank which made it look very realistic. When movie was previewed, 
   audience members reacted very strongly on that scene. According to 
   writer Heywood Gould; 'One woman fainted, another person ran into the 
   lobby and demanded it's money back, and another guy was so freaked 
   out that he entered in his car on parking lot and crashed into 
   another car'. After that preview, shot of Rane's hand inside disposal 
   was cut out from the movie.&quot;).&nbsp; Rane's son gives up the

   think they have also killed Rane. He wakes up in the hospital, has 
   his destroyed hand replaced with a hook and plans to get even with 
   everyone involved in the robbery. Together with a groupie (Linda 
   Haynes), who wore his POW bracelet while he was in captivity and his 
   angst-ridden POW buddy Johnny (an early role for Tommy Lee Jones), 
   Rane goes down to Mexico to exact revenge. It's bloody, exciting and

   total darkness (in a movie running 86 minutes). If the film was good, 
   most of this could be forgiven. Unfortunately, this is not the case 
   here. It's bloodless, nearly nudity-free and downright boring. The 
   only reason I stayed with this film to the end was the 
   always-welcomed presence of Lance Henriksen, who always injects an 
   air of professionalism in anything he's in (even those roasted turds <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Mind Ripper">MIND

   daughter on board, goes down in the remote Pacific Northwest forest, 
   Henriksen hires a team of experts to take him through the woods to 
   search for his daughter. It's apparent from the start that Henriksen, 
   who is a billionaire and runs a bio-tech company, has ulterior 
   motives for finding the plane. Add to that the fact that they are 
   being systematically eliminated by an angry Sasquatch, whose family 
   was killed by the crashing plane, and what you should have is 
   something juicy or at least interesting. Too bad that this is a dry 
   and dull affair, as the Sasquatch attacks are bloodless, the monster 
   itself is only glimpsed as a blur until the end and the team of 
   experts come straight from the Stereotype 101 School of Characters: 
   An alcoholic hunter, a terrified computer genius, an earnest tracker, 
   a know-it-all zoologist and a blackmailing she-bitch. The film does 
   have a fairly sympathetic ending, but that and Henriksen's presence 
   cannot save it from ending up in the discount cut-out bins in the 
   very near future. Originally filmed as <B><A HREF="untold_2002.htm">THE

   Christ is in the Bible and an old manuscript (probably the Old Sea 
   Scrolls) and nowhere else until modern times (Actually his speech 
   makes a lot of sense to an Atheist like myself). We then see old 
   Jewish Nazi chaser Abraham Weiss (Marc Lawrence; <B><A HREF="pigs.htm">PIGS</A></B> 
   - 1972; now available in a must-own <A HREF="pigs_1972_blu-ray.htm">Blu-Ray/DVD

    get excited by what he sees on TV. It's Olivier giving an interview. 
   He runs outside and grabs his neighbor, NY Police Detective Lt. 
   Sterne (Cameron Mitchell; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Demon1979">THE
    DEMON</A></B> - 1979), to compare the guy's face on TV to a bunch of 
   old articles he has taped to his wall, some dating back to the late 
   1800's. Lt. Sterne says that while there is a remarkable resemblance, 
   Olivier hasn't aged in over 35 years and that is impossible. Lt. 
   Sterne would like to help his old pal, but he would look like a crazy 
   loon if he did. Abraham decides to confront Olivier himself and ends 
   up dead, his dying words to a cop being &quot;Look at the 
   walls!&quot;, which the cop conveys to Lt. Sterne. When Lt. Sterne 
   takes a closer look at the walls he sees exactly what Abraham saw: 
   Olivier hasn't aged a day since the Franco-Prussia War (and probably 
   long before that). Lt. Sterne confronts Olivier at a disco where Lt. 
   Sterne mentions God, which really bugs Olivier and he threatens Lt. 
   Sterne, who tells Olivier, &quot;Don't step on me or you'll never get 
   rid of the smell!&quot;. Lt. Sterne keeps looking at the newspaper 
   articles and photos on the wall, which pisses off his partner Dieter 
   (Marc Lawrence again). He tells Dieter, &quot;I see swastikas 
   swimming in my oatmeal!&quot;. Meanwhile, Claire is still having bad 
   nightmares and she is being bothered by excommunicated priest Papini 
   (Maurice Grandmaison; <B><A HREF="in_search_of_bigfoot_1976_cry_wilderness_1986_dvd.htm">CRY
    WILDERNESS</A></B> - 1986), who had no luck with James and Lt. 
   Sterne, which turn out to be real, as a monster hand breaks through 
   her closet wall and tries to grab her. James becomes very worried 
   about her sanity because she also believes that Olivier is the Devil. 
   James believes if there is no God, there is no Devil, so he confronts 
   Olivier and ends up dead (all the dead bodies, including Papini's, 
   have &quot;666&quot; burned into their corpses). Claire decides that 
   she has to do things on her own when Lt. Sterne and Dieter die when 
   their car explodes (Well, Lt. Sterne does. Dieter dies when his car 
   won't open and it fills with smoke while Olivier smiles through the 
   car's window.), so she hits Olivier with her car and has Olivier's 
   female assistant help her put him in her trunk. She and Olivier's 
   female assistant strap him to a hospital gurney, where Claire removes 
   his heart without the use of anesthesia and sticks it in a microwave. 
   Claire learns an important lesson at that time: Never fuck with the 
   Devil. It seems like Claire actually hit his female assistant which 
   Olivier made her look like himself and she actually removes her heart 
   and nukes it without any anesthesia. Claire screams and Olivier walks 
   through the double doors, as the film ends as the doors close behind 
   him. The Devil wins once again. Even though the condensed version in <B>NIGHT
    TRAIN</B> had some stop-motion animation added to juice-up the tale, 
   the full version really doesn't need it. This is one of those films 
   that was released in many versions at various lengths. The one I 
   watched was the <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Academy Ent.">Academy
    Entertainment Video</A> 83 minutes long VHS version and is missing a 
   sequence that takes place in Las Vegas, but since it is all 
   exposition, you are not really missing anything. IMDb states that the 
   film is originally 94 minutes long, which I find questionable, 
   because I have seen nearly every version of this film and none of 
   them ever went past 88 minutes (the five minute Las Vegas scene, 
   which is nothing but driving footage and then going to a disco). The 
   print on the Academy VHS was grainy, but watchable and if you want to 
   see it in better condition (but not much), get the Premiere 
   Entertainment International VHS (identical to the Academy print in 
   length, but using the <B>NIGHTMARE</B> title), because the two DVDs, 
   from Troma and Mill Creek, are abominations. This VHS version is 
   colorful and quite clear (Unfortunately, I sold it years ago) Of 
   course, if you would like to see the abridged version in near perfect 
   condition, you could always buy the <A HREF="http://www.vinegarsyndrome.com">Vinegar
    Syndrome</A> <A HREF="night_train_to_terror_1985_blu-ray.htm">Blu-Ray</A>.
    But you really should watch the full version (Las Vegas sequence or 
   not), because it is a creepy little addition to the supernatural 
   genre and has a lot more to say about religion than any horror film I 
   can remember in a long, long time. Also starring Klint Stevenson,

   and she arrives in a village that is experiencing a series of brutal 
   murders of young woman. We hear a villager say that this is the sixth 
   brutal murder since Baron Igor Dalmar died and the only way to stop 
   the murders is to burn down Castle Dalmar. Ivana has an appointment 
   at Castle Dalmar, but no one is willing to take her there, turning 
   their backs to her when she mentions the castle. Fedor (Ezio 
   Sancrotti; <B><A HREF="action.htm#ViolentProfession73">THE VIOLENT PROFESSIONALS</A></B> 
   - 1973), the coachman who was driving the hearse for the sixth 
   victim's funeral, offers to take Ivana there in his carriage and she 
   accepts. As they arrive at the castle, Fedor puts the moves on Ivana, 
   telling her that she will fall in love with Baron Janos Dalmar 
   (Carlos Quiney, as &quot;Jeffrey Chase&quot;; <B><A HREF="zorro_films_spain_1971.htm">ZORRO
    THE INVINCIBLE</A></B> - 1971; <B><A HREF="zorro_films_spain_1971.htm">ZORRO,
    RIDER OF VENGEANCE</A></B> - 1971), the late Igor's brother, and 
   then he will kill her, but Ivana fights him off her and goes to the 
   castle. She is greeted at the front door by housekeeper Olga 
   (Cristiana Galloni, as &quot;Christina Pathe&quot;), who refuses to 
   let Ivana enter the castle because she doesn't believe she is a 
   doctor, nevermind a biochemist, but Ivana forces her way in and 
   refuses to leave, demanding to talk with Janos. When the Baron walks 
   into the room, Olga (who is in love with him) accuses Janos of 
   knowing the biochemist he hired was a woman and says that one day he 
   will fall in love with her again. Janos tells Olga she can leave any 
   time she wants and she throws a hissy fit, saying she knows what he 
   does with all the young women. Over dinner, Ivana tells Janos that 
   his hounds have whip marks on them and he is not happy that she is 
   accusing him of abusing his animals (He has quite the temper and 
   doesn't like to be disobeyed). Janos then agrees to let Ivana stay 
   and shows her his laboratory. He tells Ivana that before Igor died, 
   he was working on discovering the mysteries of life and he continues 
   his brother's experiments to try and find the solution to 
   immortality. He then shows her Igor's corpse, which was never buried. 
   It sits in a vat of black liquid that keeps his skin cells from 
   deteriorating. Ivana tells Janos that it is too late to save Igor and 
   he says, &quot;We'll see&quot; and tells Ivana that she will be 
   helping him create a formula to regenerate human cell tissue and she 
   is intrigued, agreeing to help him. Young pretty maid Cristiana 
   (Agostina Belli; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightOfThe Devils72">NIGHT
    OF THE DEVILS</A></B> - 1972) then shows Ivana to her room and says, 
   &quot;I'll laugh at your funeral&quot; when she turns her back on 
   Ivana. That night, someone kidnaps Ivana from her bed, ties her to a 
   table and tells her, &quot;Stay pure, or my vengeance will turn on 
   you!&quot; In the morning, she wakes up in her own bed as if nothing happened.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Meanwhile, back in the village, Police Inspector Zarak (Mariano 
   Vidal Molina; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CurseOfTheDevil1973">CURSE 
   OF THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1973), who was sent to the village to 
   investigate the series of murders of young women, questions Fedor and 
   wants to know if he harmed Ivana, but Fedor says he didn't harm her 
   in any way, but he may have puts the moves on her. Even though he 
   can't read or write, Fedor is made to put his mark on a written 
   statement, and when he does, he is immediately accused of rape and 
   the Judge (Javier de Rivera; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DraculaSaga1973">THE
    DRACULA SAGA</A></B> - 1973) sentences him to six months in the 
   penitentiary. The Inspector wants to visit Castle Dalmar to make sure 
   Janos hasn't harmed Ivana, so he makes up an excuse to get into the 
   castle. When he arrives at the castle gates, the Inspector wants 
   Ivana to sign a statement saying she hasn't been harmed, but Olga 
   won't allow the Inspector inside the castle and makes Ivana sign the 
   statement at the front gate. Janos wants to know what the Inspector 
   wanted and Ivana says he seemed more interested in him than he was in 
   her. Janos tells Ivana that talk in the village says he is 
   responsible for the six young women's deaths. Ivana asks if it is 
   true that he's the killer and Janos answers, &quot;If I were, why 
   would I tell you?&quot; Ivana then tells Janos what happened to her 
   last night and he says that the liquid covering Igor's body has 
   hallucinogenic properties and whenever she is around Igor's body, she 
   should wear a surgical mask, saying if she does, she will no longer 
   have such vivid hallucinations.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Ivana begins to fall in love with Janos (just as Fedor told her), 
   but will she become the latest murder victim? Olga begins giving 
   Ivana the stink-eye when she notices Janos giving Ivana romantic 
   looks, but Janos still has quite the temper and tells Ivana if she 
   doesn't obey him, she can leave the castle and never come back. Janos 
   has a Jekyll/Hyde personality and yells at Ivana for opening a 
   certain door in the castle, saying it is forbidden to her and the 
   staff (He says that door leads to a part of the castle that is 
   falling apart and it may kill anyone who dares to enter it. I think 
   we all know that is a line of crap, right?). When Ivana starts giving 
   Janos lip, like no other woman before, he begins to admire her, but 
   it just makes her more pissed-off. Ivana notices Janos always leaves 
   the castle on horseback whenever there is a full moon and that every 
   full moon another young woman is brutally murdered. Is Janos the 
   killer or is it someone else? On one such full moon, Cristiana is 
   visited in her bedroom at her father's house by the same person that 
   visited Ivana in hers. That night, while Janos is away on horseback, 
   Ivana disobeys Janos, opens the forbidden door and does some 
   exploring. What she finds, I'll leave for you to discover. When 
   Cristiana is found dead, the Inspector pays the castle a visit and 
   this time he has a real legal reason to come inside. He asks Ivana if 
   she saw anyone leave the castle last night, like Baron Janos. Ivana 
   lies and says Janos spent the night in her room. The Inspector finds 
   it hard to believe and leaves the castle, but not before telling 
   Ivana that she will have to testify to that under oath at the 
   inquest. When the Inspector leaves, Janos tells Ivana she didn't have 
   to do that because he's actually innocent. Ivana says she thinks he 
   is guilty, telling him he has a split personality, but he adamantly 
   denies it. Then Janos finally realizes what is really going on. Do 
   you know? Will Ivana become the next victim, especially after Janos 
   marries her? After the wedding ceremony, Cristiana's father, Fritz 
   the Butler (Antonio Jimenez Escribano; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#GraveyardHorror1971">GRAVEYARD
    OF HORROR</A></B> - 1971), shoots Janos with a shotgun, thinking it 
   was he who killed his daughter. Did he shoot the wrong person? Is 
   blood really thicker than water? Will Janos and Ivana be able to 
   consummate their marriage? For the answers to those questions, I'm 
   afraid you are going to have to watch the film, but I've given you 
   all the clues you need in this review. If you are braindead and need 
   further clues, I'll say this: Someone is not as dead as they seem, 
   but they need <A HREF="scream_of_the_demon_lover_1970.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/scream of the demon lover italy poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="307" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>something

    It's not very hard to figure out what is going on here and director

   Enrico Colombo (<B><A HREF="night_of_the_blood_monster_1970.htm">NIGHT
    OF THE BLOOD MONSTER</A></B> - 1970), makes it way too easy to 
   figure out, as there is no one besides Janos or Igor to blame for the 
   murders. It is nice that Ivana is a &quot;modern&quot; woman, who 
   takes no guff from anyone, especially from the demanding Janos, but 
   the film could have been stocked with a few more red herrings to make 
   the film more entertaining. While Erna Schurer doffs her clothes at 
   the drop of a hat (we only see topless nudity, no &quot;full 
   frontal&quot; action) and the full view of Igor we get at the end of 
   the film is quite interesting, the film could have used much more 
   violence than what we get. The film is not a complete disaster, 
   though, as Janos is a very interesting character, quite unlike other 
   cookie-cutter characters we see in Gothic horror films. He demands 
   obedience and when he doesn't get it, he turns into a dictator, 
   saying it's either his way or the highway, even when he's accused of 
   murder. He doesn't suffer fools gladly. This is an interesting relic 
   from the early-'70s that has basically disappeared from view. I can't 
   remember this ever being shown on television, so seeing it for the 
   first time in nearly fifty years brought back a lot of memories to 
   when I saw it as a teen in a movie theater. This isn't must-viewing, 
   but I did enjoy watching it, if only for nostalgia reasons.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   goes to the police, where Inspector Casati (Fabrizio Jovine; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Psychic1977">THE

   is that Mary Ann&nbsp; went to Sardinia for an ocean outing. The 
   Inspector and the Rome police force have a serial killer on the 
   loose; his victims being young blind women (That is very specific, 
   isn't it?), so he promises Barbara that he will find Mary Ann before 
   she becomes the next victim. When an unconscious, dehydrated young 
   blind woman is found floating in a row boat in the ocean, the 
   Inspector phones Barbara to tell her they found Mary Ann, but when 
   Barbara gets to the hospital, she discovers it is not Mary Ann.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Barbara is certain Lombardi knows more than he is telling, so she 
   breaks into his boat and searches it, finding a letter written by 
   Mary Ann to a man called David Malcolm, a reknown scientist and 
   oceanographer. Lombardi catches Barbara rifling through his boat and 
   tries to rape her, but she is saved by Malcolm, who knocks Lombardi 
   out. When Lombardo comes to, he tells Barbara and Malcolm he didn't 
   mention David Malcolm's name to the police because David asked him 
   not to. Lombardi goes on to say that David recently lost his wife and 
   son in a tragic accident, so Barbara gets the idea to question the 
   still-nameless blind girl in the hospital (she brings along a tape 
   recorder) to see if David Malcolm had anything to do with her 
   drifting aimlessly in a row boat. When Barbara sneaks into her 
   hospital room, the blind woman jumps from her bed screaming and jumps 
   out the window of her hospital room, killing herself. A shocked 
   Barbara is then hit on the head by some unknown man, who steals her 
   tape recorder. When Barbara wakes up, she discovers she is now blind 
   (What are the chances?)!, so she is sent to an eye specialist, who 
   tells Barbara the chances of her regaining her eyesight depends on 
   her taking it easy, so she decides to go on vacation to Sardinia. 
   While in the hotel's pool, Barbara meets a handsome man, who turns 
   out to be David Malcolm (Jeremy Brett; <B><A HREF="medusa_touch_1978.htm">THE
    MEDUSA TOUCH</A></B> - 1978). Was this a chance encounter or was it 
   planned? Turns out it was planned, as Barbara is not blind at all, 
   she and Inspector Casati came up with the idea (Barbara is wearing 
   clouded contact lenses to make her look blind, supplied by the eye 
   specialist) for Barbara to get close to David to check him out. 
   Barbara is not sure if David has anything to do with her sister's 
   disappearance, but she needs more time with him to be sure. Barbara 
   then has another chance (?) encounter with David (she is wearing the 
   clouded contact lenses and walks with the aid of a white cane) and he 
   invites her to stay with him on his private island, which she accepts.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Barbara travels to David's secluded island (thousands of seagulls 
   fly overhead, hence the film's title), where she meets Carol (Pamela 
   Salem; Miss Moneypenny in <B><A HREF="never_say_never_again_1983.htm">NEVER
    SAY NEVER AGAIN</A></B> - 1983), David's cousin, who doesn't seem 
   pleased to see Barbara, especially after noticing she is blind. When 
   Barbara asks to use the phone, Carol tells her it is not working and 
   David interjects, saying the phone goes on the fritz often, due to 
   the island's location far away from civilization. Barbara explores 
   the island on her own (still pretending to be blind), when she hears 
   an ear-piercing scream that drightens her to her core. David then 
   confesses that the scream came from his son, Frederick (Marco 
   Mastantuono; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#GreatAlligator">THE GREAT ALLIGATOR</A></B> 
   - 1979), who is still alive. He goes on to explain that Frederick 
   survived the tragic accident that took his wife's life, but his face 
   and body were hideously burned in the fire. He tried getting 
   professional help for his son, but every woman who saw his 
   horribly-burned face screamed and ran away in terror, so he came up 
   with the idea of hiring blind women to help Frederick, but it didn't 
   work out because his son has gone quite insane.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    I know what you are thinking. Is Frederick the serial killer? Well, 
   don't expect me to tell you if you are right or wrong, because I have 
   to leave you something to discover on your own, but I will tell you 
   this: Barbara hasn't told the Inspector or Martin she was going to 
   David's island, so she's pretty much on her own, except for Lombardi, 
   who shows up on the island and tells Barbara he will help her escape. 
   Also, Frederick has grown quite fond of Barbara and threatens to kill 
   Carol and his father if they harm one hair on Barbara's head. David 
   tells Barbara he can't let her leave the island because she is the 
   only woman his son has shown an interest in. Barbara says she will 
   stay if she can confront David and Frederick together to see if Mary 
   Ann was one of the girls brought to the island to help Frederick. If 
   she was. Barbara wants to know what happened to her. Barbara then 
   reveals to Carol and David that she's not really blind (which turns 
   out to be a huge mistake!), removing her clouded contact lenses. 
   David says, &quot;I knew you weren't blind&quot;, telling Barbara he 
   saw Frederick knock her out in the hospital room, just after his son 
   talked to the blind woman, making her jump out the window in<A HREF="secret_of_seagull_island_1981_1985.htm#SeagullIsland"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/seagull island poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   terror and killing herself. Think you have it figure out? Is Mary Ann 
   still alive? Why do we never get a good look at Frederick's face?

    As I have already stated at the beginning of this review, this was 
   originally a 1981 mini-series, titled simply <B><A HREF="secret_of_seagull_island_1981_1985.htm#SeagullIsland">SEAGULL
    ISLAND</A></B>, that ran in five 60-minute installments. 
   Directed/produced by Nestore Ungaro, whose film resum&eacute; is very 
   thin, the only other item he directed was a 1970 Italian mini-series 
   which translates to &quot;SEA TALES&quot;. He did supply Underwater 
   Photography for the films <B><A HREF="tentacles_1977.htm">TENTACLES</A></B> 
   (1977) and <B><A HREF="code_condor_1990.htm">CODE CONDOR</A></B> 
   (1990), but that is where his resum&eacute; ends. Ungaro co-wrote 
   this mini-series (and feature version) with Augusto Caminito (<B><A HREF="grand_slam_1967.htm">GRAND
    SLAM</A></B> - 1967) and Jeremy Burnham (<B><A HREF="horror_of_frankenstein_1970.htm">HORROR
    OF FRANKENSTEIN</A></B> - 1970), making it a true Italian/British 
   co-production. What I especially liked about this film is that 
   everyone speaks English, so it is nice to hear Gabriele Tinti and 
   other Italian genre actors speak without being dubbed, which they 
   usually were. This feature version, as well as the original mini-series,
    was never legitimately available on home video in any format in the 
   United States, but I managed to catch it streaming on YouTube from 
   user &quot;Gypsycyn&quot;, which was ripped from a Greek-subtitled 
   VHS tape, but is still watchable. The entire mini-series is available 
   on <A HREF="secret_of_seagull_island_1981_1985.htm#GermanDVD">German DVD</A>,
    which is viewable in English with removable German subtitles. I have 
   to say that for a 103-minute feature taken from a 300-minute 
   mini-series, there are few lapses in continuity, as the feature 
   version flows smoothly, unusual for a feature taken from a 
   much-longer version (Yet, I am still trying to figure out the 
   feature's opening, where two scuba divers kiss passionately 
   underwater, before they are both buried by an underwater landslide. 
   At first, I thought it showed David's son and wife's deaths, but 
   unless they were involved in incest, that just doesn't fit! I hope

   During the week, Count Boris Zaroff (Michel Lemoine; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#PlanetsAgainstUs62">PLANETS

   (yet is office is bare-bones, just a desk and a lamp!), but during 
   the weekend, he likes going to his palatial country estate and 
   hunting...naked women. Yes, this French film is the umpteenth 
   retelling of <B><A HREF="most_dangerous_game_1932.htm">THE MOST

   Boris is also the son of the original film's Count Zaroff (who was 
   portrayed by Leslie Banks), which tries to give this film some 
   legitimacy, but fails for so many reasons.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film opens with Boris on horseback, he and his hound Inga 
   chasing a naked woman on his property. He corners the girl, whips her 
   with his riding crop and knocks her down a cliff, where she dies (we 
   see her bloody body on a boulder). After a long week of work (What 
   the hell does he do? All we ever see is his secretary [Sophie 
   Grynholc] hand him some papers and wish him a nice weekend.), Boris 
   drives to his country estate, picking up beautiful (and horny) 
   hitchhiker Stephanie (Maria Mancini) on the way. They stop at a hotel 
   and get it on and then he drives her to his estate (uh, oh!), where 
   they walk hand-in-hand through his property. They stop in a field to 
   make love, where Boris shows his true colors. He tries to strangle 
   her and bites her breasts and Stephanie runs away, Boris following 
   her in his Rolls, begging her to forgive him. He then runs her over 
   and stops his car, saying to Stephanie's dead body, &quot;You are 
   broken. You are nothing but a spineless ragdoll!&quot; He puts her 
   body in the trunk, drives to his private lake and dumps her body over 
   his rowboat and into the middle of the lake. But who is the woman 
   that is haunting his memory? Could it be the one woman who got away? 
   Could it be the only woman he ever loved? Or could it be both?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Boris enter his palatial estate, where his butler Karl 
   (Howard Vernon; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#FrenchSexMurders">THE 
   FRENCH SEX MURDERS</A></B> - 1972) talks to him in existential terms 
   (&quot;Life is transitory.&quot;) and dotes on his every whim. Karl 
   has brought Boris a young woman named Jeanne (Patricia Mionnet) for 
   him to play with, as we hear Karl's innermost thought about her, 
   calling Jeanne's life &quot;futile&quot; and how she was doomed to 
   die before he brought her here (Like he was doing her a favor!). 
   While Boris is outside playing with Inga, he meets ghostly young 
   woman Anne (Jo&euml;lle Coeur), the woman who haunts his every waking 
   moment. We discover more about her: She is married and, when we see 
   her dancing with Boris, she has a huge bloodstain on the back of her 
   dress. Is Boris responsible for it or is her husband? Boris is in 
   some sort of trance (or he is just plain crazy) and we see him chase 
   Anne into his family cemetery, where he stops by a tomb., which 
   happens to be Anne's. He runs back to his estate, where he stares at 
   a portrait of Anne. Karl has no idea who Anne is (or so he tells 
   Boris) and thinks Boris stares at it because she is pretty (He offers 
   to bring Boris a real pretty woman).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next weekend, Boris brings home Jo&euml;lle (Martine Azencot), a 
   woman he was interviewing at work and Karl drugs her champagne. She 
   begins dancing in what looks like a combination stripper/voodoo 
   priestess ritual, while a black man holds her as she gyrates (This is 
   all happening in her drugged mind). Karl shows Jo&euml;lle to her 
   room, which is full of fancy womens clothing, none of it hers. As 
   Boris is sitting on his throne-like chair, petting Jeanne like a dog 
   (!), Karl comes into the room and informs Boris that the 
   &quot;show&quot; is about to begin. We then see Boris watching 
   Jo&euml;lle through a two-way mirror, as she masturbates with a blue 
   boa on the bed, moaning and reaching a climax (Hey Karl, do you have 
   any more of that drug?!?). Boris then enters the room, but all he can 
   see is Anne in the place of Jo&euml;lle. Karl enters the room and 
   says to Boris, &quot;Fear is a bad advisor.&quot; (WTF?!?) and has 
   Inga chases Jo&euml;lle down the stairs, the hound killing her. Then 
   there is a knock on the door. It's Francis (Robert Icart) and his new 
   bride Muriel (Nathalie Zeiger). Their car has broken down and Boris 
   welcomes them into his home. I guess we can all figure what comes next.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That is the problem with this film, everything is telegraphed and 
   there a no surprises. It also doesn't help that everyone does the 
   stupidest things possible, as Boris talks Francis and Muriel to try 
   out his rack in the mansion's torture room, where Muriel is chained 
   on top of Francis as a bed of spikes slowly lowers towards their 
   bodies, impaling and killing them. That's the bloodiest scene in the 
   film and it comes a few minutes before the film ends. Michel Lemoine 
   also directed and wrote this mess of a film, giving us nothing but 
   softcore scenes of sex filmed though a vaseline-<A HREF="seven_women_for_satan_1976_foreign_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/seven women for satan france poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>coated
    lense. Sure, there is plenty of nudity, but nudity without a 
   believable story means nothing, as it seems forced, telling us to 
   enjoy the nudity, but leave your brain at the door, because you are 
   not going to need it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Both Boris and Karl talk like they are teaching Psychology 101 For 
   French people and it gets rather monotonous and trite after a while, 
   yet when the women hear it, they doff their clothes. Hell, if it 
   actually worked, I would be talking like Sigmund Freud all the time 
   (That's the exact way Karl talks, or, at least, the way the person 
   who dubbed Howard Vernon talks!). There is also very little graphic 
   violence on view, just the Francis/Muriel death scene and Jeanne 
   falling on some spikes at the end of the film. Let's talk about the 
   ending. Boris follows Anne into her tomb, where they make love. Boris 
   then discovers that he is actually kissing her skeleton (!), as the 
   tomb door closes, locking him in. He screams for help and Karl hears 
   him, but he doesn't help him, driving off in Boris' car. He doesn't 
   see that Anne is sitting in the back seat and the film ends with 
   Karl's screams, as animated blood drips on the screen. Not does it 
   only make no sense, it seems tacked-on, as an afterthought, as if 
   Lemoine wrote himself into a corner and had to use a nonsensical 
   ending. It would have been better if it ended with Boris being 
   trapped in the tomb for all eternity. It would have had more 
   &quot;punch&quot;. Lemoine doesn't even try to give this film any 
   &quot;oomph&quot;, as the hunting scenes are flatly filmed (and we 
   can plainly see that the naked female in the beginning of the film is 
   wearing a black piece of cloth covering her private parts. Nobody's 
   bush is that big!) and the sex scenes are not memorable in any way 
   (as well as having the worst music playing when they happen). Lemoine 
   directed over 20 films (many of them porn) and if every one of them 
   is like this, I have no interest in seeing them (Lemoine passed away 
   in 2013). This film was supposedly banned in its native France for a 
   few years, but there's nothing it it you haven't see a thousand time 
   before. Filmed as <B><A HREF="seven_women_for_satan_1976_foreign_ads.htm">LES
    WEEK-ENDS MALEFIQUES DU COMTE ZAROFF</A></B> (&quot;The Evil 
   Weekends Of Count Zaroff&quot;), this film never had a theatrical or 
   VHS release in the U.S., making its premiere on DVD from Mondo 
   Macabro in 2003. It hasn't been upgrade since then, which should tell 
   you a lot. I saw this on streaming channel Drive-In Classics for 
   free, so at least I didn't blow money on it. The French, they are a

   Fred is instantly smitten with Betty and is always by her side, much 
   to her consternation. When they arrive at the castle, caretaker 
   Patrick (Calogero Reale, as &quot;Edward Barrett&quot;) ushers them 
   into a room and they meet all the other people who are also there for 
   the reading of the will. Sir Percival (Umberto Borsato, as 
   &quot;Gordon Mac Winter&quot;) regales everyone with a story about 
   how the castle's previous owner, scientist Sir Reginald Thorne, had 
   passed away three years earlier, and his assistant, Dr. Quick, 
   apparently went looney after being infected with leprosy and has been 
   in an insane asylum ever since. Sir Reginald is interred in the 
   seventh grave in the family crypt located beneath the castle's 
   chapel. He also tells them that Sir Francis Drake was once the owner 
   of this castle. Drake plundered ships not belonging to the Queen and 
   it is said that he hid his treasure in this castle. Sir Percival 
   tells everyone that his daughter Katy (Stefania Nelli; <B><A HREF="beyond_the_frontiers_of_hate_1972.htm">BEYOND
    THE FRONTIERS OF HATE</A></B> - 1972) is a practicing medium and 
   suggests she holds a seance to contact the spirit of Sir Francis 
   Drake (always a good idea) in hopes he will tell them where the 
   treasure is hidden. The seance is unsuccessful, as Katy contacts a 
   spirit named Dan, who takes over Katy's body and shouts to everyone 
   in a deep voice, &quot;Get out! Get out!&quot; Lawyer Elliot (Nando 
   Angelini, as &quot;Fernand Angels&quot;; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#BloodyPitHorror1965">BLOODY
    PIT OF HORROR</A></B> - 1965) looks out a window and sees a light on 
   in the castle's chapel and everyone hears the chapel's bell ringing, 
   even though it isn't moving. They all go to the chapel and discover 
   Patrick hanging by his neck, dead. Sir Reginald's tomb is opened in 
   the family crypt and his body is missing. The funny thing is, the 
   tomb doesn't look broken into, but rather broken out of. Could Sir 
   Reginald be the robed figure we see roaming the castle? Better yet, 
   did Sir Reginald kill Patrick or could it have been one of the guests?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Everyone wants to have the will read so they can leave the castle, 
   but Elliot, who is the notary in charge of the will reading, says 
   they can't, they must wait until Lady Ferguson arrives. If she 
   doesn't arrive in two days, she will lose her share of the 
   inheritance. A short time later, a messenger arrives and informs 
   Elliot that Lady Ferguson has been dead for a month, her death being 
   mysterious, maybe even murder. Elliot then gathers everyone for the 
   reading of Sir Reginald Thorne's will, but when Elliot unlocks his 
   briefcase to retrieve the will, he finds it is not there. Elliot is 
   perplexed, as he had the only key to the briefcase and he keeps it on

   to investigate Patrick's death, interrogating everyone in the castle, 
   beginning with maid Betty, but Fred finds his questions insulting and 
   rather aggressive. A short time later, when the group shows the 
   Inspector where Patrick was killed, the barking of a little dog 
   points them to the family crypt, where they find Fred's dead body 
   stuffed into Sir Reginald's coffin. A visibly shaked Robert grabs the 
   Inspector by the lapels and tells him if he doesn't find out who 
   killed his brother, he will make sure that he pays for the crime. The 
   Inspector tells Robert to calm down, he will find the killer. Priest 
   Father Crabbe (Ferruccio Viotti, as &quot;Richard Gillies&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#SexOfWitch1973">SEX
    OF THE WITCH</A></B> - 1973) then excuses himself, saying he is no 
   longer a young man and needs some sleep, leaving the castle, Everyone 
   else remains in the castle for the night. Before he goes to bed, the 
   Inspector takes a tour of the castle by himself. He asks the butler, 
   Bill (Marco Kramm, as &quot;John Sullivan&quot;), where he should 
   sleep and Bill offers him his bedroom since he wasn't expecting 
   another guest. The Inspector refuses Bill's kind offer, saying he saw 
   a comfortable couch in the sitting room and that will do for the 
   night. We can see Betty is scared, pushing her bureau against her 
   bedroom door, while Bill and a cheating Mary kiss each other 
   passionately (&quot;Please, call me Bill.&quot;) and wish each other 
   a goodnight.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Mary is awoken in the middle of the night by the sound of a piano 
   playing and leaves her bedroom to investigate. When everyone else 
   hears the same thing, they all go to the piano room and discover 
   Mary's unconscious body lying on the floor and Sir Reginald's corpse 
   sitting at the piano. After putting Mary in her bed, Robert excuses 
   himself, saying he has something important to do, while Father Crabbe 
   and Elliot carry Sir Reginald's corpse back to the family crypt (It 
   is never explained why Father Crabbe is there, since he left the 
   castle earlier to go to sleep! This film is extremely sloppy that 
   way). Robert then comes upon the Inspector's unconscious body in 
   another room. When he comes to, the Inspector tells everyone that he 
   had a strange feeling that someone or something was 
   &quot;influencing&quot; him; an instant feeling of fatigue overcame 
   his body and he collapsed to the floor, unconscious. All the women 
   decide to sleep in the same room, feeling that there is safety in 
   numbers. The Inspector is sure that one of the guests in the castle 
   is the killer (No shit, Sherlock!), but he seems more interested in 
   the killer carrying Sir Reginald's corpse around the castle, 
   declaring he will find that person and make sure they are punished. 
   The Inspector and Father Crabbe search the castle's cemetery, while 
   Bill sits at the piano, but before he can play a single note, the 
   stool he is sitting on frightens him (For some reason, this film is 
   full of camera zooms of furniture, accompanied by &quot;scary&quot; 
   theremin music). The Inspector and Father Crabbe part company, just 
   before someone whacks Bill on the back of his head with a blunt 
   object, rendering him unconscious (There's a lot of that in this 
   film!). Everyone comes running towards the sound of Bill moaning, but 
   it turns out to be nothing but a diversion, as the killer grabs Katy 
   while she is alone. We see the robed killer carrying Katy's 
   unconscious (!) body to Sir Reginald's laboratoty, while the rest of 
   the guests wonder where Katy is (We learn early in the film that Sir 
   Reginald performed &quot;strange&quot; experiments in his laboratory 
   with his assistant Dr. Quick, not elaborating what those 
   &quot;strange&quot; experiments were). Everyone splits up into groups 
   of two (always a good thing) to look for Katy, while we see the 
   killer, now in a white lab coat, preparing a syringe to inject into 
   Katy, who is strapped to an operating table. Just who is the killer 
   and what are these &quot;strange&quot; experiments? To get those 
   answers, you'll have to watch the film for yourself, because the 
   answers are rather lame and if I were to type them up, my index 
   fingers would fall asleep from boredom! Oh, what the Hell! Since this 
   film doesn't deserve my respect (and I'm a huge fan of Italian Gothic 
   horror films), I'm going to spoil the ending just for you! <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">WARNING:
    SPOILERS!!!</FONT></B> It turns out Sir Reginald Thorne never died, 
   he just simply took another identity, as......Inspector Martin

   was infected with leprosy and passed it on to him (it was actually 
   Quick's body in his coffin) and he's slowly going mad from the 
   disease. Just as he is about to infect Katy with a leprosy tainted 
   syringe, the surviving guests bust through the laboratory door with a 
   small squad of policemen (Where in the hell did they come from???)

    Nearly everyone in front and behind the camera have had their names 
   Anglicized, yet this film was never dubbed in English (at least as 
   far as I could discover). Rumor has it the the U.S. distributor, once 
   they viewed the film, refused to pay for the dubbing or even give it 
   a theatrical release and it's easy to see why. Even for 1965, the 
   plot was cliched and uninvolving, offering little in the way of 
   scares, entertainment value or <A HREF="seventh_grave_1965.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/seventh grave italy poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="207" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>even
    caring what happens to the players, as they are nothing but 
   cardboard cut-outs. Director/co-screenwriter &quot;Finney Cliff&quot; 
   is actually Garibaldi Serra Caracciolo and this is his only 
   directorial credit. Hell, it's his only film credit! Co-screenwriter 
   &quot;Fredrich Mills&quot; is actor Antonio Casale, who portrays 
   Robert Jenkins here. This is his only screenwriting effort, as he 
   usually used the pseudonym &quot;Anthony Vernon&quot; when acting is 
   films like <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WhatDoneSolange1972">WHAT HAVE 
   YOU DONE TO SOLANGE?</A></B> (1972) and <B><A HREF="action.htm#ViolentProfession73">THE
    VIOLENT PROFESSIONALS</A></B> (1973), just to name a couple. The 
   final co-screenwriter, &quot;Edmond W. Carloff&quot; (Really?) is 
   actually Alessandro Santini, the director/screenwriter of the obscure <B><A HREF="#SkinUnderClaws1975">THE
    SKIN UNDER THE CLAWS</A></B> (1975), as well as the director of the 
   equally obscure semi-giallo flick <B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#ThisFreedonWet1971">SWEET
    WOMAN'S SKIN</A></B> (1971). There's not much to recommend here, as 
   the story is old hat, the black &amp; white cinematography flat and 
   the music soundtrack (by Leopoldo Perez Bonsignore, who only scored 
   three films) is not memorable. As a matter of fact, I can't remember 
   a single tune in the film, which is very unusual for me. The entire 
   film is just like the music score. You'll forget it as soon as it is 
   finished. The entire hidden treasure subplot is dropped rather 
   quickly and never mentioned again. It would have been a much better 
   film if they stayed with it. The only scene that raised a chuckle 
   from me is when Patrick takes everyone on a long walk to the family 
   crypt, only to reveal a secret passageway (one of the cheapest secret 
   passageways in Gothic castle history, just a large chair hiding a 
   hole in a wall!) that leads everyone directly to their starting 
   point! I mean, why not use the secret passageway to begin with and 
   not put the guests through such a long walk? Let's face it, folks, 
   this film is boring and offers nothing of interest to Gothic horror 
   fans. Like many of the characters in this film, I'd rather be 
   unconscious than watch this again.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   legitimate release in any format in the United States, no theatrical,

   companies like Something Weird Video and Sinister Cinema never

   doesn't have the slightest grasp of English sentence structure. While 
   I usually adapt very quickly to bad English subtitles (such as

   has no talent. Fate throws him a fastball and he happens to meet the 
   Devil (who is playing the sickest double-neck guitar I've ever seen) 
   who offers him a deal: His soul (and a few more later on) for the 
   talent to play guitar like no one has ever played guitar before. 
   Angel (ironic name, right?) accepts the deal and immediately grows 
   long black rockstar hair and has two groupies (who have also made 
   separate deals with old Scratch) who follow him everywhere and do his 
   bidding. Angel auditions for a band (managed by Traci Lords, the 
   lucky bastards!) and amazes everyone with his ability to learn new 
   songs by looking at the music sheets for a few seconds. The lead 
   singer of the band, Jonny (who wears half t-shirts cut-off at the 
   chest and talks kinda gay), takes an immediate dislike to Angel. Good 
   call because Angel takes over the band, becomes lead singer and signs 
   a major record deal with slimey executive Troy Donahue. To make a 
   long story short, Angel goes on a killing spree and&nbsp; Jonny must 
   find a way to kill Angel and his two groupies before they sacrifice 
   Traci Lords. The only way to kill them: Make them eat! If they eat 
   anything they will die! That's right, you read it correctly. Director 
   Mark Freed, who also co-wrote all the original (and unintentionally 
   hilarious) songs, tries to make something different and he does, it's 
   just that it's all bad. He throws a voodoo woman (Tyger Sodipe, who 
   can't act worth a lick), copious nudity, exploding heads, lots of 
   music and really bad acting all together and hopes something will 
   stick. It doesn't stick, it stinks, but it's funny as hell if you're 
   in the right frame of mind. The ending will leave you slackjawed as 
   Angel tries to kill Traci Lords while the headlining band is sitting 
   in the stands thinking it is all part of the show. Their reaction to 
   the final act is priceless. This may not be a good film but it is 
   entertaining. Also starring Tim Moffett, Markus Grupa, Karen Russell,

   I am fascinated by the career of actor/bodybuilder Gordon Mitchell. 
   He came into prominence during the early-'60s (after a short stint in 
   U.S. theatrical films and TV) when Italy began churning out hundreds 
   of Sword &amp; Sandal epics and when that phase died down, Mitchell 
   jumped on the Eurospy (<B><A HREF="killer_likes_candy_1968.htm">THE

    THE BASTARD</A></B> - 1967) bandwagons, appearing in scores of films 
   in both genres (Apparently, Mitchell was a wise investor, purchasing 
   land in both Italy and Spain, making his fortune by building a 
   Western town on one of those properties and renting it to production companies<A HREF="skin_under_the_claws_1975.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/skin under the claws italy poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="217" HEIGHT="307" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   making Spaghetti Westerns because it was a perfect backdrop for those 
   kind of films). Even though Mitchell never had to work again (he 
   passed away in 2003 at the age of 80), his career choices for the 
   '70s and beyond are some of the most mind-bending films out there, 
   including <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Frankenstein 80">FRANKENSTEIN

    When the film opens, we see Professor Helmut (Mitchell) standing 
   over the body of a recently deceased man, telling his associates, Dr. 
   Silvia Pieri (Genevieve Audry; <B><A HREF="pirate_and_the_slave_girl_1959.htm">PIRATE
    AND THE SLAVE GIRL</A></B> - 1959) and Dr. Gianni Dani (Tino 
   Boriani; <B><A HREF="man_pride_and_vengeance_1967.htm">MAN, PRIDE 
   &amp; VENGEANCE</A></B> - 1967), that the organs in the human body 
   quit functioning at different times after death. He hopes one day to 
   keep those organs viable for nearly 25 years, creating a human organ 
   body bank and making death obsolete. Both Silvia and Gianni tell 
   Professor Helmut that death is part of life, but he scoffs, saying if 
   we can extend human life indefinitely, shouldn't we at least try? We 
   then see someone wearing dark sunglasses and a floppy black hat 
   picking up a wisecracking prostitute (Mirella Rossi; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Mania1974">MANIA</A></B> 
   - 1974) off the street and taking her to some unknown location. The 
   next time we see the prostitute, she is naked and screaming, holding 
   her bloody stomach and falling to the floor. When her body is 
   discovered, chain-smoking Inspector Rinaldi (Ettore Ribotta; <B><A HREF="fasthand_1973.htm">FASTHAND</A></B> 
   - 1973) demands his men find the killer. The coroner (Renzo Borelli) 
   tells the Inspector that the prostitute's body was missing a couple 
   of vital organs and had decaying flesh under her nails and on her 
   neck and body, as if she &quot;hugged a corpse&quot; and the 
   Inspector is not pleased, telling him it is difficult enough finding 
   a living suspect, can he imaging how difficult it would be finding a 
   dead one?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Meanwhile, Gianni and Silvia start a romantic relationship as only 
   the Italians can, talking to each other in riddles and Silvia 
   remarking on how Gianni always wears sunglasses, even at night 
   (Gianni tells her he has an aversion to bright lights, making him 
   look like the killer and even more like a red herring to those of us 
   well-versed in giallo clich&eacute;s). Professor Helmut tells Gianni 
   that he has a weak heart and he wants Gianni to transplant a new 
   heart into his body to give him new life, so he can continue his 
   experiments to defeat death. Before Gianni can perform the 
   transplant, Professor Helmut dies, but his body disappears from the 
   morgue. More female bodies end up dead, one of those bodies found cut 
   up in pieces and stuffed into suitcases, all of them missing vital 
   human organs and all of them also having decaying flesh under their 
   nails and all over their bodies. Is the killer really dead? It 
   doesn't take a genius to discover that the killer is Professor 
   Helmut, as the Inspector discovers he came to Italy from Venezuela in 
   the mid-'50s (Hmmm...Venezuela? That can only mean one thing!). We 
   then find out that Professor Helmut was a scientist for the Nazi 
   regime during World War II and when Berlin was bombed at the end of 
   the war, he lost his wife, who was the only love in his life. He has 
   found a way to transfer his wife's brainwaves into the body of 
   another woman. And who is that woman, you may ask? Why, none other 
   than Silvia, whom we find out looks exactly like Helmut's late wife. 
   Professor Helmut kidnaps Silvia and does some experiments on her, but 
   she escapes and before the Professor can get her back, the Inspector 
   and his men shoot and kill him. As the Inspector walks away from 
   Gianni and Silvia, we hear Gianni scream and when he gets back to the 
   couple, he sees that Silvia has stabbed Gianni to death while 
   uttering, &quot;I am life. I am death!&quot; <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">THE

    This extremely short, 76-minute film has a mystery even a braindead 
   corpse could solve (besides Gianni and Professor Helmut, there is no 
   one else to suspect!), making it one of the most minor giallo films 
   out there. But just because it is easy to solve, doesn't mean that it 
   is a waste of film. Quite the contrary, this is a film as weird as 
   they come, especially the performance by Ettore Ribotta as the 
   chainsmoking Inspector Rinaldi. He berates his men constantly, making 
   them seem useless and when they do come up with vital clues, he 
   claims them<A HREF="skin_under_the_claws_1975.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/skin under the claws  spain vhs front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="194" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   as his own! Add to that the extremely unusual way Gianni and Silvia 
   begin their romance and then continue with it (making it seem like it 
   is going down the crapper, but, surprise!, it isn't) and you have a 
   film that is 100% Italian cheese. Director &quot;Al Santini&quot; is 
   actually Alessandro Santini, a director of some very obscure flicks, 
   including the romance film with a slight tinge of giallo titled <B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#ThisFreedonWet1971">SWEET
    WOMAN'S SKIN</A></B> (1971) and the Spaghetti Western <B><A HREF="beyond_the_frontiers_of_hate_1972.htm">BEYOND
    THE FRONTIERS OF HATE</A></B> (1972). He was a Production Manager on 
   the Spaghetti Western <B><A HREF="kill_or_be_killed_1966.htm">KILL OR 
   BE KILLED</A></B> (1966), which also starred Gordon Mitchell. If it 
   seems like huge chunks of exposition are missing from this film (such 
   as how Silvia managed to escape from Professor Helmut and other 
   instances that will have you throwing your hands in the air in 
   exasperation), it can all be credited to Santini, who didn't feel 
   that he needed to show such things to the audience to advance the 
   plot. Well, guess what? He was wrong! This is one of the most 
   fragmented films I have ever laid eyes on, which gives it a really 
   strange vibe, like you are experiencing someone's vivid nightmare. Is 
   it good? Oh my, no, not by a long shot. But is it entertaining? Yes, 
   yes it is. It is full of female nudity and some graphic violence, but 
   a lot less blood than normal, especially for a film of this type and 
   considering the subject matter. I'm not pretending that this is a 
   good film by any stretch of the imagination, but it is just obscure 
   and strange enough to merit at least one viewing. Also be aware that 
   the film is supposedly set in 1963 (it is referred to in a bit of 
   dialogue), but anachronisms abound, including Gianni's Porche, which 
   looks to be a much-later model, and other visual sights, putting this 
   film strictly in the early-1970s.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   (2002) -</B> Pretty standard slasher/comedy flick (filmed in South 
   Africa, trying to pass itself for Mid-West America and failing 
   miserably) with a couple of redeeming factors. The film begins with a 
   young Jonathan &quot;Mac&quot; MacDonald playing in his family's barn 
   when he spots his grandfather Jethro (Danny Keogh) wheeling in the 
   body of a woman and bringing her into a part of the barn where he has 
   the corpses of other bodies, draining them of blood into glass jugs. 
   Mac hides, but his music box (which plays &quot;Old MacDonald Had A 
   Farm&quot;) gives him away and Jethro tries to grab him. A lantern 
   tips over during the struggle and Grandpa catches on fire, burning 
   down the barn. Mac gets away and his mother moves the both of them 
   away from the farm. Thirteen years later, Mac (James O'Shea) is the 
   lead singer in an Emo rock band called Slash. They are about to hit 
   the big time when a record executive hears their set and wants them 
   to record an album, but a man called Billy Bob (Nick Boraine, who <A HREF="slash_2002.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/slash 2002 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="177" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>looks
    like a hillbilly cousin of Jake Busey and is the best thing about 
   this film) appears and tells Mac that his Aunt has died and the 
   funeral will be held at the MacDonald farm. The entire band 
   (including the roadie and a female groupie) decides to go with Mac to 
   the farm, so they hop on their tour bus and make the long trip. They 
   are greeted by Billy Bob and Mac's father Jeremiah (Steve Railsback; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Ed Gein">ED
    GEIN</A></B> - 2000), who hasn't seen his son for over thirteen 
   years and is happy he has come (Jeremiah's favorite saying is, 
   &quot;I'm just yankin' yer chain.&quot;). Jeremiah has rebuilt the 
   barn exactly like it was before it burned down and invites the band 
   to rehearse there after the funeral. They have no choice, since their 
   bus has broken down, there is no cell phone service (God, I hate that 
   plot device!) and it will be two days before the part to fix the bus 
   will be delivered. Mac becomes more and more distant from his band 
   and begins to do chores like chopping wood. His father seems very 
   pleased, but the rest of the band is worried about him. They should 
   be, since someone dressed like a scarecrow begins slashing the cast 
   with a scythe. It all leads to the eventual showdown, where Mac and 
   the remaining members of his band (the drummer, the keyboardist and 
   the roadie have all been murdered) must fight the scarecrow, who 
   turns out to be Jethro (he survived the fire). He is collecting the 
   blood of humans to irrigate the crops because legend has it that 
   spraying the crops with blood will yield a great harvest. Jeremiah is 
   also in on it, so he and Jethro try to kill everyone except Mac, who 
   they want to join them. After some trickery from Mac involving a 
   knife with a retractable blade, he manages to set both Jeremiah and 
   Jethro on fire and burn down the barn yet again. The finale shows 
   that Mac and his band (which now contains Billy Bob as their 
   keyboardist!) have become famous, thanks to the experience (Mac has 
   written a whole album devoted to the MacDonald farm), but the final 
   shot shows that a severely burned Jeremiah is still alive and hoping 
   to get the &quot;Harvest of Blood&quot; back on track.&nbsp; While 
   nothing special, this is still an enjoyable horror flick thanks to 
   the performance of Nick Boraine as Billy Bob. He looks like he is 
   going to be the bad guy, but turns out to be pretty funny, as he 
   continually outwits the band's keyboardist, Keith (Craig Kirkwood), 
   especially in accuracy in firing Keith's pistol and being really good 
   playing Keith's keyboard (He's the church's organ player, after 
   all!). Director Neil Sundstrom (<B><A HREF="howling_5_the_rebirth_1989.htm">HOWLING
    V: THE REBIRTH</A></B> - 1989) keeps the bloodletting to a minimum, 
   although there are a few memorable moments, including the roadie 
   being grinded up in a crop thresher and a couple of gory scythe 
   impalements. The comedy elements mostly fall flat, except for the 
   exploits of Billy Bob, who should have a movie devoted just to him 
   (Keith calls him &quot;Sling Blade&quot; at one point). On the whole, 
   this film is worth at least one viewing if you enjoy slasher flicks.

    and killed by three murderous characters: Chainsaw Charlie (Neil 
   Napier), Dr. Ripper (Christopher Piggins) and Preacherman (Neil 
   Napier again). In this special edition of the show, six American 
   contestants are vying for the twelve million dollar grand prize. They 
   are set loose in what looks like a huge multilevel warehouse filled 
   with mazes and bicker and fight with each other as well as share 
   intimate secrets about their past and why they are here in the first 
   place. The really strange thing about this game is that there is only 
   one cameraman to follow the action, so where ever the cameraman is, 
   the killings will follow (a major plot point at the finale). The 
   first person to be killed is Rebecca (Carolina Pla), who says that 
   she has MS and does not want to die a slow death. She kills 
   Preacherman by planting a wooden stake through his eye but is 
   graphically cut in half at the waste (her guts spill out) by

    MEN AGAINST THE SON OF HERCULES</A></B> - 1961). They are throwing a 
   party at the castle they just purchased to live in. Care to guess 
   which castle that is? As Louise plays piano for the guests, Wolfgang 
   tells his butler to go to the wine cellar and to come back with the 
   finest claret he can find. As the butler makes the long walk down to 
   the wine cellar and dusts off bottles of claret, we see the vampire's 
   coffin behind some barrels of wine. The nameless vampire (really, he 
   has no name!) rises from his coffin and decides to join the party. 
   Louise somehow senses the vampire in the room, stops playing the 
   piano and tells her husband that she is feeling faint. Wolfgang then 
   mingles with the guests (way to worry about your wife!), as the 
   vampire walks up to Louise, takes her hand and dances a waltz with 
   her. All the female guests swoon over the vampire, while the male 
   guests look upon him with contempt, one man calling him 
   &quot;sinister&quot;. When the music ends, Louise nearly faints and 
   the vampire quickly exits the party. Louise excuses herself, saying 
   she is ill and goes to her bedroom to recuperate. While the female 
   guests gossip about the vampire, saying no one knows who he is and he 
   is probably Louise's secret lover, the vampire appears in Louise's 
   bedroom, lays her on the bed and bites her on the neck.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A few days pass and Louise begins acting strange, not eating and 
   looking pale, so Wolfgang has a doctor (Alfredo Rizzo; director of <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BloodsuckerDance73">THE
    BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE</A></B> - 1975; and a star of <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#BloodyPitHorror1965">THE
    BLOODY PIT OF HORROR</A></B> - 1965 [also with Brandi]) come to the 
   castle and examine her. He tells Wolfgang that her pulse is weak and 
   she is probably anemic, saying Louise needs plenty of bed rest and a 
   good meal. That night, Louise leaves her bedroom and walks out of the 
   castle, where she meets the vampire, who tells her that she will soon 
   become a vampire and they will be together for all eternity. The 
   doctor may very well know that Louise is becoming a vampire, telling 
   Wolfgang that he and his wife need to get out of the castle 
   immediately and when they do, to contact Dr. Nietzche (&quot;Paolo 
   Solvay&quot; a.k.a. Luigi Batzella, director of <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Devil's wedding">THE
    DEVIL'S WEDDING NIGHT</A></B> - 1973) in Vienna, but not telling 
   Wolfgang why. Louise is too weak to leave the castle, so Wolfgang 
   travels to Vienna, where he meets Dr. Nietzche and discovers he is a 
   vampire hunter. At first, Wolfgang has no idea who he is, thinking he 
   is a medical doctor, until he tells Wolfgang that the only way to 
   save his wife is to kill the vampire who bit her. When Wolfgang and 
   Dr. Nietzche get to the castle, the servants tell Wolfgang that 
   Louise is dead, but when Wolfgang and the Doctor go to her bedroom, 
   Louise is not there; the bed is empty and the window is wide open. 
   Dr. Nietzche tells Wolfgang it is not too late to save his wife, 
   because the vampire has taken her away and will continue to bite her 
   until she becomes a full-fledged vampire, so they must find her and 
   destroy the vampire before that happens.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While Wolfgang is sobbing in the garden, Louise appears and bites 
   him on the neck, but the vampire shows up and drags Louise away. Dr. 
   Nietzche performs a blood transfusion on Wolfgang so he doesn't 
   suffer the same fate as his wife. He then tells Wolfgang that they 
   must find Louise's body before morning so they can put her to rest by 
   driving a wooden stake through her heart, but Wolfgang refuses to do 
   it because he loves his wife so dearly. Yes, Louise is now a 
   full-fledged bloodsucker, complete with sharp fangs and a deadly 
   aversion to the sun, but will Wolfgang be able to kill her, along 
   with the nameless vampire who infected her? I'm afraid you'll have to 
   watch the film to find out, but I will divulge this: Death is not 
   always the final answer.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   not giving the vampire a formal name? It would help knowing the name

    -</B> This is another 70's late-night TV staple that just up and 
   disappeared until Alpha Video found what looks like a worn 16mm black 
   &amp; white print and put it on DVD. This Spanish production tells 
   the story about a group of treasure hunters, led by Andre (Antonio 
   Casas), who are looking for hidden treasure in some remote mountain 
   region in Greece. As they dynamite a cave, they discover<A HREF="sound_of_horror_1965.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sound of horror dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="119" HEIGHT="175" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   some petrified eggs and the mummified body of a Neanderthal Man. 
   During the explosions, one of the eggs cracks open and something 
   hatches from it. I say something because it is invisible. Andre and 
   his group are joined by fellow WW II veteran Acelo (James Philbrook) 
   and his gang (which includes a young Ingrid Pitt) who have the second 
   half of a treasure map that will lead everyone to the exact location 
   of hidden gold artifacts. They eventually find the treasure but may 
   never get to enjoy it as the invisible creature begins ripping apart 
   the cast (quite graphically for a mid-60's production) while it 
   unleashes a blood-curdling cry, the Sound of Horror. Greed gets the 
   best of our treasure hunters. Their thirst for gold outweighs their 
   concerns for safety and, unfortunately, some of them will die before 
   the night is through. As daylight approaches, the creature (Is it a 
   dinosaur or an alien? The brief glimpses may make you think it's a 
   dinosaur, but who ever heard of an invisible dinosaur?) breaks into 
   their house. One of the guys says, &quot;Do you mind if I tremble a 
   little?&quot; as they try to find a way to defeat the creature. Maybe 
   fire will work?&nbsp; Ingenious in the way it portrays the creature 
   as an unknown entity (and probably saving the filmmakers time and 
   money on creating a monster suit), <B><A HREF="sound_of_horror_1965b.htm">SOUND
    OF HORROR</A></B> is still much too talky for it's own good. 
   Director Jose Antonio Nieves Conde does manage to liven the 
   proceedings with the grizzly creature attacks, but they are few and 
   far between. The screenplay, by Conde, producer Gregorio Sacristan 
   and Greg Tallas (co-director of <B><A HREF="#SatansSupper1980">THE 
   NIGHTMARE NEVER ENDS</A></B> - 1980), spends too much time on people 
   squabbling, falling in love (Tragic European starlet Soledad Miranda 
   is also in the cast) or listening to silly superstitions to make this 
   anything but a mindless potboiler. Most reviews list the creature as 
   a dinosaur, but I take exception to that classification because, 
   although we get very quick glimpses of it towards the end, it could 
   still be an alien creature (the invisiblity makes me leans towards 
   extraterrestrial). I remember watching this as a kid on TV and being 
   scared to death by the creatures cry (it sounds like an old lady 
   being murdered). Now, I just watch it and wonder what all the fuss 
   what about. It's not a bad film, mind you, it's just another 
   disappointment best remembered as a kid than as an adult. Also

   Sandro (Fred Robsahm; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#BlackKiller1971">BLACK

   habits, putting her down as much as humanly possible (Angela doesn't 
   have a single kind word to say about her). It is quite possible that 
   Angela wants Daddy all to herself. Even Sandro asks her if she has

    Angela hopes to set up Irene by having Sandro come on to her to see

   she won't let him get too close (if you know what I mean), which 
   pisses off Angela. No one, not even Angela's father, know anything

    to dig up some dirt on Irene so she can tell her father. Angela 
   still has Sandro continue to hit on Irene, hoping she will have a 
   weak moment to use against her. Irene proves to be one cool cookie, 
   as nothing seems to phase her, which just makes Angela more 
   determined to find out about her past, having her friend Donatella 
   help her find something, anything on Irene that she can use against 
   her (When Sandro thinks he is finally getting to third base with 
   Irene, she asks him to turn out the lights. When he does, he 
   discovers Irene has left his house, hearing her car pull away). 
   Angela &quot;accidentally&quot; meets Martha at the beauty parlor and 
   pumps her for information on Irene's past, but she learns nothing, 
   because Martha also knows nothing about her past. Sandro tells Angela 
   that Irene has tremendous self-control and is probably frigid (!), so 
   Angela gives Irene a Cosmo-like sex quiz, finding out that Irene has 
   yet to make love to her father. Yes, Irene is a virgin and she will 
   remain one until she marries Angela's father. Is that true or is 
   Irene purposely lying to Angela?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Daddy goes away on an extended business trip, telling Angela that he 
   doesn't know when he is coming back, but when he does, he is marrying 
   Irene. This trip leaves Angela alone with Irene, giving her plenty of 
   time to play head games with her, showing Irene a slideshow of her 
   last stepmother, but like I said before, Irene is one cool customer, 
   at least in front of Angela, although we get the feeling that there 
   is something majorly wrong with Irene, deadly wrong. Angela deceives 
   Irene by pretending to be upset about her previous stepmother, one 
   moment refusing to move, lying completely naked on her bed and the 
   next moment being antsy and inviting Irene to a beach excursion, 
   purposely getting themselves lost and leaving Irene by herself, 
   making her believe that Angela died, slipping off a cliff to the 
   boulders below, that is, until she sneaks up behind Irene and scares 
   the shit out of her. Yes, Angela is a piece of work, but is Irene 
   more dangerous than her? All the evidence points to yes, as we will 
   witness more head games, the next one being twice as dangerous as the 
   one before it, until Irene shows her true colors. What colors would 
   they be? I'm afraid you'll have to watch the film for yourself to 
   find out.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This slice of Italian exploitation sleaze, directed and co-written 
   by Silvio Amadio (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Amuck1971">AMUCK</A></B> - 
   1971; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SmileBeforeDeath72">SMILE 
   BEFORE DEATH</A></B> - 1972), is stuffed with full-frontal male and 
   female nudity, wrapped around a fairly involving mystery, as the 
   layers are slowly peeled back on Irene's past. This film does slow 
   down during the middle section, but I guarantee you will watch the 
   whole film, just to discover who Irene really is, because she seems 
   to be too disingenuous for her own good. You'll be thinking she is 
   too good to be true and you're right, but in this film, everyone is a 
   heel. Sandro is a boytoy of a rich older woman named Joan (Dana Ghia, 
   as &quot;Felicita Ghia&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BloodstainButter71">THE
    BLOODSTAINED BUTTERFLY</A></B> - 1971) and he's stealing her money 
   and selling off her property to pay his gambling debts. Angela is a 
   bitch with a capital &quot;C&quot;, who only cares about herself. She 
   really doesn't give a damn about her father, using him as an excuse 
   to cover her true nature. Still, she looks amazing naked and she has 
   no problem with parading around naked because she just doesn't care. 
   Angela uses people like you and I would use a tissue to blow our nose 
   and you'll want to slap that smirk off her face, but that is this 
   film's central theme: girls behaving badly. Angela even seduces Irene 
   on the beach, while Sandro secretly snaps away with his camera 
   (Angela is so petty, she complains to Sandro that some of his photos 
   are out of focus!), those photos leading to the film's crushing 
   finale. Amadio does a pretty good job with the material (co-written 
   with Roberto Natale [<B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#BloodyPitHorror1965">BLOODY
    PIT OF HORROR</A></B> - 1965]), keeping you guessing, about Irene's 
   past and how far Angela is willing to go to discover it (which is 
   pretty damn far!). It's only when Angela realizes that she went too 
   far, does the film conclude with a very unexpected finale (The reason 
   Irene is hiding her past may not be shocking today, but it was when 
   this film was made). I never heard of this film (shot as <B><A HREF="so_young_so_lovely_so_vicious_1975.htm">PECCATI
    DI GIOVENTU</A></B> [&quot;Sins Of Youth&quot;]) until I saw it on

    Classics</A> and decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did, even 
   if they showed the same commercial over and over every ten minutes. 
   Just like most Italian genre films, <A HREF="j&amp;b_scotch_whiskey_in_italian_films.htm">bottles
    of J&amp;B (Justerini &amp; Brooks) Scotch</A> are consumed, Sandro

   gambling debts. Also starring Flavio Sorrentino (<B><A HREF="desperately_last_summer_1970.htm">DESPERATELY

   of an ancient Pagan diety known as Domitian in the ruins of the Roman

   tunnel is being dug directly under Professor Lasky's feet and the 
   constant rumbling of the ground shaking from the dig worries Lasky of 
   a cave-in that will ruin his expedition. When the subway digging 
   causes an earthquake-like tremor, it reveals an entrance in the 
   Catacombs that has been a secret for over two thousand years. 
   Professor Lasky quickly discovers that it is the entrance to 
   Domitian's Tomb, but he suddenly becomes very frightened when he 
   discovers that an ancient curse has been unleashed when<A HREF="specters_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/specters italy poster2c small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   he picks up a cracked stone tablet that reads, <B>&quot;Invoked or 
   not invoked, evil will come&quot;</B>. Lasky knows that curses like 
   this are not to be fooled with, as the subway digging caused the 
   curse to be released, but how can he convince anyone that the curse 
   is real, especially since the Catacombs are also a tourist hotspot, 
   as tours of the Catacombs happen every day? Quite simply, he keeps it 
   to himself...for the moment!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then watch one such outing, where a female tour guide (Erna 
   Schurer; <B><A HREF="#ScreamDemonLover70">SCREAM OF THE DEMON LOVER</A></B> 
   - 1970) and a blind male tour guide named Matteo (Massimo De Rossi; <B><A HREF="hearts_and_armour_1983.htm">HEARTS
    AND ARMOUR</A></B> - 1983) take a group of tourists into the 
   Catacombs, telling them to stay with the group and not wander off 
   because it's easy to get lost (When one tourist gasps when she 
   notices one of their tour guides is blind, he says to her, 
   &quot;There's no need of eyes to see your way in this place, where 
   only darkness reigns. We now are in a place of suffering, of 
   persecution and a cemetery.&quot; Way to greet the paying customers, 
   pal!). So what do a couple of young horny idiots do? That's right, 
   they wander off to get it on and get lost in the Catacombs. The male 
   idiot gets separated from the female idiot when a huge gust of 
   demonic wind (this film's trope of alerting the audience when the 
   curse is about to happen) hits them in the face. The female idiot 
   gets chased by a pack of hungry rats and she hides in an open grave 
   carved into the Catacomb's wall (She chooses to hide in a grave on 
   floor level to escape the rats and not one that is higher up, which 
   is why she's an idiot). Just when it looks like she is to become rat 
   chow, she is pulled from the grave by Matteo and she and her 
   seriously wounded idiot boyfriend are taken to the hospital by an 
   ambulance. Matteo then says, &quot;Evil is not a symbol. Evil has a 
   face and a...and a...and a...light sleep.&quot; (What the fucking hell???).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film stops in its tracks several times by a subplot involving 
   Marcus (John Pepper; an Associate Producer on the film <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Reborn">REBORN</A></B> 
   - 1984), Professor Lasky's assistant, and his girlfriend, 
   actress/singer Alice (former Miss Denmark Katrine Michelsen; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#DeliriumGioia1987">DELIRIUM:
    PHOTO OF GIOIA</A></B> - 1987). We see Alice making out in a car 
   with an unknown man, who stops mid-coitus to take a pee. When he 
   doesn't return, Alice gets out of the car to look for him, only to 
   get attacked by...<A HREF="creature_from_the_black_lagoon_1954.htm">The
    Creature From The Black Lagoon</A>! Yes, it all turns out to be a 
   movie being filmed and, after that scene, Alice tells Marcus that she 
   wants to spend a weekend alone with him, but Marcus tells her he 
   doesn't have the time because Professor Lasky is on to something big 
   and he wants to be a part of it (We not only go through this scenario 
   once, but three times during the film, which brings any momentum the 
   film had to a screeching halt). Marcus has no problem spending a 
   night with her, but two nights is out of the question. Yes, Marcus 
   treats Alice like a hooker, only he doesn't leave money on the night 
   table when he leaves the next morning!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Professor Lasky starts to get &quot;signs&quot; that something bad 
   is about to happen, such as day turning to night in the blink of an 
   eye. Other signs include all the bottles in the wine cellar of a 
   restaurant popping their corks and covering the restaurant owner in 
   wine, while the ground splits open beneath his feet, nearly sending 
   him to Hell, but he escapes by the skin of his nose when an 
   underground power line shoots up from the ground and nearly 
   electrocutes him. He runs upstairs, trips on a rug and barrels 
   through a plate glass window, where sharp shards of glass slice his 
   throat open, killing him. A bum hiding in the shadows tells Marcus 
   and Alice it is time to leave this city and to run away from this 
   rotten place. He tells them, &quot;The centuries and the wickedness 
   of the people who live here have corroded it to the core. From its 
   womb hath come forth blind monsters. Go, go now, flee the city before 
   evil, which is tired of hiding in the bowels of the Earth, decides to 
   wake. Leave before the sinister howls of the phantoms engulf us 
   all!&quot; He then laughs and says, &quot;Give a coin to a poor 
   cripple.&quot; (I wonder if they did?). That night, Alice gets out of 
   bed, walks into the living room and steps on a pool of blood that has 
   soaked through the rug. A huge gust of demonic wind (uh, oh!) blows 
   open the windows and she discovers the tablet that Marcus has left 
   there (he's actually sound asleep in her bed!). From that point on, 
   she has a supernatural link to the demon who is about to do a lot of killing.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Marcus gets geared-up with all the latest technology (for 1987, that 
   is) to be the first human to enter Domitian's Tomb in over two 
   thousand years (Why Professor Lasky, who has been searching for this 
   tomb all his life, doesn't go, is never explained. My guess is that 
   Mr. Pleasence wasn't paid enough to walk through dark, dank catacombs 
   in pitch darkness. He does tell Marcus, &quot;Being the first is a 
   rare privilege.&quot;). Armed with a video camera and a GPS device, 
   technician Andrea (Riccardo De Torrebruna) is able to track Marcus' 
   every move. Marcus has to crawl on his belly to traverse the narrow 
   corridors leading to the tomb (OK, now I know why Pleasence wasn't 
   the first!) and has to use oxygen when he begins to smell strange 
   fumes. When he reaches the tomb, Marcus screams as the ground beneath 
   him collapses, sending him further down the rabbit hole. He ends up 
   in a Pagan temple full of skeletons and strange frescos that lead to 
   another room, a vault containing an altar and a sarcophagus&nbsp; 
   with an inscription on it that reads, &quot;MALUM&quot;. Professor 
   Lasky knows what it means, but he doesn't share it...for the moment. 
   Marcus also finds an ancient dagger whose handle is shaped like a 
   claw embedded in one of the stone walls. When he pulls the dagger out 
   of the wall, Marcus passes out and is saved by Andrea, who says 
   Marcus probably passed out from a lack of oxygen. Wanna bet? 
   Professor Lasky looks at the dagger and says Marcus, &quot;What you 
   found may solve a...mystery.&quot; He doesn't elaborate any 
   further...for the moment (How many fucking secrets is he going to hide?).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Professor Lasky goes to the tomb with his team (Which brings up 
   the question: Did he have to crawl on his stomach to get there? His 
   shirt looks clean!), he tells Marcus that the dagger was used in 
   rituals that performed human sacrifices. When Lasky notices a strange 
   symbol on one of the walls, he tells Marcus,, &quot;This is not a 
   Christian symbol, but something quite different. It's like the mark 
   left by the dagger on the victim, after the sacrificial blow. So this 
   discovery proves that legend is a fact.&quot; Bone fragments found at 
   the tomb prove not to be human, but some unknown animal a scientist 
   named Carl (Giovanni Bilancia) is not able to identify...for the moment.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    An antiques dealer named Gaspare (Riccardo Parisio Perrotti; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Psychic1977">THE
    PSYCHIC</A></B> - 1977), who financed Professor Lasky's 
   archaeological dig, is actually a black marketeer who is very 
   interested in getting his hands on the dagger, so it can be part of 
   his secret museum of stolen artifacts, which he visits often. He 
   tries to bribe Lasky, but he tells Gaspare that it belongs in a real 
   museum for everyone to see, not just him. While Gaspare is in his 
   private museum, admiring his ill-gotten artifacts, he hires the evil 
   Gino (Giovanni Tamberi; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#TooBeautifulDie1988">TOO
    BEAUTIFUL TO DIE</A></B> - 1988) to steal the dagger from Lasky. 
   Meanwhile, someone or something with very long and sharp claws begins 
   killing members of Professor Lasky's team, beginning with Barbara 
   (Lavinia Grizi), who has her face ripped off in rather graphic 
   fashion (Special makeup effects by Italian master Sergio Stivaletti; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#LastHouseWoods2006">THE
    LAST HOUSE IN THE WOODS</A></B> - 2006) while Gino watches in 
   horror. Gino tries to escape, but he is caught by the demon creature 
   and we don't know what happens to him...for the moment. Gaspare is 
   next when the demon crushes his head against a stone wall (Right 
   after he discovers Gino's skinless body hanging on a wall).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Lasky, Marcus and Andrea open the lid of the tomb and discover it 
   empty except for some ashes, which Andrea says he will have Carl 
   analyze. Alice is in the recording studio trying to finish her album, 
   but her heart is not in it, especially when her microphone turns into 
   a snake! Alice has some type of psychic connection to the demon, but 
   we do not know the reason why...for the moment. Andrea visits 
   scientist Carl to have the ashes analyzed and to find out what animal 
   the bone fragments came from, but Carl isn't there, just his 
   screeching pet monkey. Andrea phones Marcus, who is in the middle of 
   screwing Alice, telling him to come to Carl's laboratory immediately, 
   Carl has reconstructed the animal from the bone fragments and he 
   needs to see it, ASAP. Marcus gets dressed, leaving Alice all hot and 
   bothered, telling Marcus that if he leaves, their relationship is 
   over (He's okay with that!). Marcus drives to Carl's laboratory, but 
   before he gets there, we see the demon rip off Andrea's face. When 
   Marcus discovers Andrea's faceless body, he calls the police and then 
   Alice to warn her, but Alice is pulled through her mattress by the 
   demon (shades of <B><A HREF="nightmare_on_elm_street_1984.htm">A 
   NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET</A></B> - 1994). After losing nearly all of 
   his team, Professor Lasky heads to the tomb and is greeted by a pair 
   of evil green eyes. When Marcus arrives at the tomb, he finds a 
   barely-alive Professor Lasky, who tells him to collapse the tunnel 
   that leads to the tomb, trapping the evil forever, then he dies. 
   Easier said than done, for, as Marcus sets the charges to seal the 
   tunnel, he hears Alice, who is still alive, calling out his name from 
   the tomb. Is she really alive or is this a trap by the demon? Will 
   the tunnel collapse before Marcus can discover the truth? If you want 
   to know the answers to those questions and why the blind Matteo is 
   still in the Catacombs, you are just gonna have to watch the film. I 
   at least have to leave you something to discover on your own, but 
   I'll give you this hint: Maybe Marcus can find a couple of free days 
   for his honeymoon, that is if the stinger in the finale doesn't stop

   (1985)-lite. It's a well-photographed (by Silvano Ippoliti; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SmileBeforeDeath72">SMILE
    BEFORE DEATH</A></B> - 1972) supernatural chiller with loads of 
   atmosphere, some gory (but much too quick) Sergio Stivaletti makeup 
   effects and very little else (unless you like to hear Donald 
   Pleasence pronounce &quot;evil&quot; as &quot;eee-vil&quot;). I 
   should hate this film with a passion, as it is slow moving and 
   uneventful, especially the drama between Marcus and Alice, but I'm a 
   sucker for horror films that take place at archaeological dig sites 
   (such as <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#DeadAreAlive">THE DEAD ARE ALIVE</A></B> 
   [1972] and <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Scorpion2Tails1982">THE 
   SCORPION WITH TWO TAILS</A></B> [1982]). Since many of the early 
   scenes&nbsp; were actually filmed in the Roman Catacombs, it gives 
   the film an eerie glow missing from most films that use obvious sets 
   to pass it off as the real thing. Unfortunately, the screenplay, 
   written by Avallone, Andrea Purgatori (Avallone's <B><A HREF="maya_1988c.htm">MAYA</A></B>

   [1983 - 1988]), falters so badly in the beginning of the story, it 
   fails to recover. Plot points, such as the subway tunnel dig, why 
   Alice is psychically connected to the demon, what &quot;MALUM&quot; 
   means and the identity of the animal Carl reconstructed from the bone 
   fragments, are dropped and never heard from again, making the entire 
   film seem piecemeal, like one scriptwriter wrote the first 25% of the 
   story and passed it on to the next writer and so forth. Much of the 
   film makes no sense at all, making it a prime example of style over 
   substance. If you know that going in to the film, you may find 
   yourself enjoying it more than people who know nothing about it. It 
   took three viewings from me to even like this film a little bit, as I 
   absolutely hated it the first time I watched it. The second time I 
   could barely handle it and the third time resulted in this review. I 
   only go through this mental torture because of you, my dear readers.

   plenty of gore (the best being the scene of a pregnant girl torn in 
   half with a chainsaw), but the story is strictly old hat. It concerns 
   an escaped psycho actor (named Irving Wallace!) slaughtering a 
   company of performers who are rehearsing a musical horror play at a 
   locked-up theater. This is merely slasher stuff showcasing various 
   ways to kill people, even if it is well done. The screenplay (by

   just plain lazy (the heroine's injured ankle only seems to bother her 
   when she needs to get away from the killer, otherwise she walks just

   (When the killer gets stabbed in the eye with a large nail, he shakes

   this, since it knocks most of the rules he set in the first film on

   - 1980) and a bimbo and her boyfriend downstairs to celebrate 
   something. A Syngenor (SYNthetic GENetic ORganism) is being held in 
   captivity. It is an alien-like creature that were genetically 
   produced to take the place of soldiers in battle. Since they are 
   asexual, they reproduce every 24 hours. A Syngenor is<A HREF="syngenor_1990.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/syngenor dvd8 front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="270" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   accidentally let loose, so Paula tells Stan that no outsiders can 
   leave alive, so we see a Syngenor kill the man and his topless bimbo 
   girlfriend. It then gets loose in the city and heads to its creator, 
   Ethan Valentine (Lewis Arquette; <B><A HREF="horror_show_1989.htm">THE
    HORROR SHOW</A></B> - 1989). It kills Ethan just as niece Susan 
   Valentine (Starr Andreeff; <B><A HREF="amityville_dollhouse_1996.htm">AMITYVILLE:
    DOLLHOUSE</A></B> - 1996) comes home and Susan throws a vase of 
   flowers at it and the water in the vase hurts it (Unlike <B>SCARED TO DEATH</B>,
    where the monster roamed through the sewer tunnels). Norton 
   Cyberdyne president Carter Brown (David Gale; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Brain1987">THE
    BRAIN</A></B> - 1987) is rapidly going crazy (nobody did crazy like 
   the late David Gale) and keeps injecting some substance behind his 
   ear (it is never explained, although the substance is a neon green, 
   just like in a certain movie Gale starred in) and believes everyone 
   in the company is out to get him (just because you're crazy doesn't 
   mean it's not true). Paula wants all the Syngenors destroyed along 
   with any files pertaining to them, but Susan and nosy reporter Nick 
   Cary (Mitchell Laurance; <B><A HREF="runestone_1990.htm">THE RUNESTONE</A></B> 
   - 1990) sneak into the company to see what they can find out. Stan 
   tries to get receptionist Bonnie (Melanie Shatner; the running joke 
   is everyone keeps asking her age) to get the files on the Syngenor 
   project downstairs and she accidentally lets loose a whole bunch of 
   Syngenors in the building (and gets electrocuted in the process). 
   Susan learns that the company has also developed a new weapon, called 
   the &quot;Deathrattle&quot; before she is spotted by a guard. Rather 
   than go through all the &quot;people trapped in a building&quot; 
   shit, I'll just give you the kills: Syngenors kill a massive amount 
   of security guards before they take the elevator and begin killing 
   upstairs. Carter uses the Deathrattle to make Stan a red stain on the 
   wall. Carter kills the rest of the board members (besides Paula) in 
   the boardroom while wearing a plastic bunny mask on the back of his 
   head (I told you he was crazy!). Paula and the head Syngenor (you'll 
   know it when you see it) are destroyed together by the Deathrattle, 
   but the Syngenor genetically re-assembles itself by using its parts 
   and Paula's parts together and they then squash Carter's head like a 
   bug. Susan remembers that Syngenors are afraid of water (What happens 
   if they were sent to the battlefield in the rain?) so she and Nick 
   turn on the sprinkler system and all the Syngenors dissolve. Oh, and 
   Susan and Nick become lovers. THE END.&nbsp; Besides the film being 
   boring as hell (William Malone must have read the screenplay by Brent 
   V. Friedman, who also wrote <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EvilAltar">EVIL
    ALTAR</A></B> [1987], <B><A HREF="ticks_1993.htm">TICKS</A></B> 
   [1993] and <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Hellbound">HELLBOUND</A></B> 
   [1993]), none of the film makes very much sense. Director George 
   Elanjian Jr. (Who never directed another film, but he was a Key Grip 
   on James Glickenhaus' <B><A HREF="#Suicide Cult">SUICIDE CULT</A></B> 
   - 1977) never tries to explain why Paula wants to take over the 
   company, what Carter is shooting behind his ear, why he is going 
   stark raving bonkers, why don't the police want to help especially 
   when there's a massacre going on (especially since one of the Chiefs 
   is friends with Susan) and why the building is so easy to sneak into 
   (The poor black guard who is in charge just up and quits. He was the 
   only one with sense.). The stabs at humor here are pathetic and it is 
   easy to spot where the film was cut to achieve an R-Rating (a scene 
   with an electric drill; Paula's death and Carter's head-squashing 
   among the most apparent). The least the DVD could do was restore 
   these scenes so there would be more gore in the film, but this is 
   just a typical low-rent monster flick from the 90's. Even the much 
   lower budgeted <B>SCARED TO DEATH</B> was 100% better than this.

   watch this film. Well, I finally did watch it and all I can say is: 
   WTF did I just watch???. This begins like some fragmented futuristic 
   TV show, where the leader of this anti-violence society, who goes by 
   the name Caronte (Riccardo Valentini), praises the new regime for 
   transmitting a radio frequency, called the &quot;Zeed&quot;, that 
   makes all violent criminals commit suicide, even future criminals who 
   haven't committed any violence yet! The bodies of the dead criminals 
   are then turned into food, which a fast food company named 
   &quot;Taeter Burger&quot; sells to all the non-violent citizens of 
   this food-starved society, in the guise of a meaty hamburger (and the 
   citizens know exactly what they <A HREF="taeter_city_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/taeter city vhs front2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>are
    eating!). But something goes wrong with the Zeed System, turning a 
   man named Trevor Covalsky (director/producer/screenwriter Giulio De 
   Santi) into a mutant immune to the Zeed, who goes about killing all 
   the important people involved in this inhumane society. A special 
   police division, called &quot;The Bikers&quot; (a group who collect 
   all the dead bodies of criminals and turn them over for food 
   processing) are called in to kill Trevor, but they run into something 
   that they cannot control, because Trevor is infecting his victims 
   with the same power he has. We watch as Bikers Wank (Wilmar Zimosa), 
   Shock (Santiago Ortaez) and Razor (the big-breasted Monica 
   Mu&ntilde;oz) try to kill Trevor, unsuccessfully, usually with very 
   gory results. That the best way I can explain this short Italian 
   cyber-punk film (running 72 minutes, 11 minutes of it the end 
   credits!), which will remind many people (including myself) of those 
   Japanese gore films like <B><A HREF="tetsuo_series_1989_2009.htm">TETSUO</A></B><A HREF="tetsuo_series_1989_2009.htm"> Series</A> 
   (1989 - 2009) and its ilk. I almost turned off the film when it 
   started, but something inside me couldn't do it because I was 
   mesmerized by the gory visuals, which are very well done (by Giulio 
   De Santi and his crew) and the insane music score (by Razzaw), that 
   puts the viewer at unease. People are skinned alive, have their face 
   melted, decapitations aplenty, impalements or have their skulls 
   cleaved in two (both horizontaly and vertically!), everything thrown 
   at the screen for the viewer to see. I'm not saying that this is a 
   good film because it's not (the story, if you want to call it that, 
   is very hard to follow), but it has a certain &quot;something&quot; 
   that hypnotizes you and you will find it very hard to take your eyes 
   off the screen. The dubbing, which is extremely bad, also adds to 
   this film's charms, especially when Caronte comes on screen to regale 
   his audience with how neatly the government is being run and then 
   reminding his audience to eat at Taeter Burger! I really can't 
   recommend this film, as it has nothing of note except for the 
   extremely gory visuals, but I also can't condemn it, because I found 
   myself watching it till the end. It's one of those films that leaves 
   me flabbergasted, not knowing why I don't hate it when I really 
   should. It's not a film I would buy, but I saw it for free on Amazon 
   Prime, so no harm, no foul, but others may want to see it just for 
   the gory practical effects. Either way, it's a film you will soon not 
   forget. I guess that's the best thing I can say about it. Giulio De 
   Santi has also unleashed <B><A HREF="giulio_de_santi_films.htm">ADAM CHAPLIN</A></B>

   Amazon, but I would suggest you watch this film first, just to see if 
   you would be interested in purchasing his other films. I really don't 
   know if I am ready for that, because my mind is still reeling from 
   this film, but if a film affects me this way, I am sure that I will 
   visit his other films in the future. De Santi announces a sequel at 
   the end of this film, but, so far, it hasn't materialized. Also

   (2014) -</B> Simply horrid piece of micro-budgeted crap that tries to 
   be sly, but ends up being much too talkative and boring. It is also 
   full of anachronisms. Spektor Island, MA - December 1971: A young 
   woman (Kerri Lynch) is exploring a seemingly abandoned cliffside 
   mansion with a flashlight (but we learn immediately that the mansion 
   has at least one other person in it and he/she doesn't look 
   friendly). The mansion has a pig motif from a cuckoo clock that has a 
   tiny pig spring out instead of the bird to a pig's head hanging on 
   the wall that pulls out a chunk of the woman's hair. She is then 
   confronted by someone wearing a painted clear mask and carrying a 
   meat cleaver (the way the killer is dressed makes him/her look like 
   an ice cream man, but the killer is listed as &quot;The Butcher&quot; 
   during the end credits). The woman runs outside with the killer close 
   behind. In a scene that makes no sense, the woman is suddenly wearing 
   a pig mask, which the killer pulls off and knocks her off a cliff to 
   the ocean below. Spektor Island, MA - December 1972: The woman who 
   fell off the cliff survived and is now back at the mansion, this time 
   with nine other women, all who received a small porcelain pig and 
   instructions to come to the mansion (I'm not going to give the women 
   any proper names because the film doesn't bother to give them any). 
   They are all there under false pretenses with fake professions. The 
   woman listed as the <A HREF="ten_2014.htm"><FONT COLOR="BLACK"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ten 2014 dvd front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="247" HEIGHT="352" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="2"></FONT></A>&quot;Renegade&quot;
    (Jade Sylvan) has a nose ring and is full of tattoos (Was that even 
   a &quot;thing&quot; in 1972?) and the rest are there are part of an 
   invitation for a business proposition that doesn't exist. After 
   meeting and listening to these ten women, we can't wait until they 
   are killed, especially the woman playing the &quot;Religious 
   Fanatic&quot; nun (Molly Carlisle), who chastises another woman for 
   eating a sandwich with meat in it. The actress dreams that &quot;the 
   ghost of Spektor Island&quot; (make up your mind; is it the Butcher 
   or the Ghost?) is in her bedroom and when she wakes up, she finds a 
   porcelain pig's head on the other side of the bed (you better laugh 
   now, because the rest of the film is insufferable). In one of the 
   film's most nauseating (or creative; depends on your point of view) 
   moments, we watch the camera spins around the room of a party 
   attended by the women and every 360&#176; turn the clock changes by 
   two hours (7:00 PM; 9:00 PM; 11:00 PM; 1:00 AM). The camera stops 
   spinning at 3:00 AM and someone slips a mickey into the 
   &quot;model's&quot; (Leah Principe) drink. While the &quot;folk 
   singer&quot; (Sophia Cacciola) plays a tune about pigs, the model 
   strips completely naked (full-frontal; the only instance of nudity on 
   the film) and enters the party, picking apart everyone's fake 
   occupations (besides the ones already mentioned, there's a doctor 
   [Susannah Plaster]; a historian [Rachael Leah Blumenthal]; a real 
   estate developer [Molly Devon]; a coed [Porcelain Dalya]; and a 
   medium [according to the credits, &quot;UnAmerika's Sweetheart&quot; 
   Karin Webb]) and then walks upstairs, where we find out she was 
   working in conjunction with the killer and he/she gives her a 
   hand-painted clear plastic pig mask, but everyone finds her dead in 
   the bathtub wearing the mask when the ceiling below the bathroom 
   begins to leak (never trust a psychopathic killer, but one of 
   braindead women tries to revive her by breathing into the mask's pig 
   snout!). A hologram of a man (in 1972?) appears in the library and 
   tells all the survivors that they are there because each of them is 
   hiding some kind of deadly secret. This film is basically an unfunny 
   feminist version of Agatha Christie's &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; 
   and when the masked killer shows up, the actress snaps the killer's 
   neck, only to discover that it's the real estate agent, another one 
   of the real killer's helpers. It's not worth it for me to describe 
   any more of the film (you will thank me for that), because the kills 
   are poorly done and, let's face it, the movie stinks. It's just a 
   bunch of awkward 70's dialogue (some of which I never heard in the 
   70's) with an occasional bloodless kill (there's only one really 
   bloody kill towards the end of the film). The set-up is straight out 
   of <B><A HREF="mission_impossible_tv_series.htm">MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE</A></B> 
   (1966 - 1973), as all the women are actually agents for the U.S. 
   government and given false identities to catch &quot;Ten&quot;, a 
   foreign agent who has some important microfilm in one of the ceramic 
   pigs (They are all given reel-to-reel tapes that self-destruct after 
   ten seconds. The makers of <B>M:I</B> should sue, especially after 
   the small stinger after the end credits.). &quot;Ten&quot; turns out 
   to be the tattooed renegade, but she may not be the real enemy. The 
   real enemy may be our own government. Are we really the enemy?&nbsp; 
   Directed, produced and written by actress Sophia Cacciola and Michael 
   J. Epstein (who wisely chooses to stay behind the camera doing at 
   least a half-dozen different jobs, including Editor and Special 
   Effects Supervisor) and also co-written by actress Jade Sylvan and 
   Sarah Wait Zaranek, this film is like spending a weekend watching 
   your Aunt Gertrude's home videos (yet it won awards at film 
   festivals, which is why I don't go to film festivals, especially 
   since I never heard of half of them). I was actually getting sleepy 
   while watching and nearly dozed off a few times, something I hardly 
   ever do (And if I do, I watch the film completely over but, 
   thankfully, I managed to keep my eyes open for this one. Another 
   viewing would have been worse than being waterboarded). You know the 
   film is in trouble when the best part of the movie are the animated 
   opening credits, but even they are deceiving (it shows women being 
   sliced in half both horizontally and vertically; something we never 
   see in the film proper). The dialogue in this film makes every person 
   seem like a Fulbright intellectual and really takes away most of the 
   film's suspense, especially when coming from these women's mouths. 
   And would someone please explain to me why &quot;The Butcher&quot; 
   would stay in a mansion where he/she supposedly killed a woman a year 
   earlier? The person may be a sociopath, but the character is given 
   zero back-story, so we really don't care what happens except that 
   he/she kills this untalented cast. I still don't get the pig 
   symbolism except when one of the women says that pigs are the most 
   intelligent animals besides humans. But what does that have to do 
   with the price of tea in China? Please, I beg of you, don't watch 
   this film unless you are suffering from insomnia. This will put you 
   right to sleep. For a film with no men in it (except for voices; 
   Troma president Lloyd Kaufman is one of those voices), one expects 
   more than this piece of garbage. Filmed in Barrington, Rhode Island 
   and Somerville, Massachusetts. A Brink Vision DVD Release. <B>Not Rated</B>,
    but only because it was never submitted to the MPAA. If it were, it 
   would get an R-Rating based solely on the nude scene.</FONT></FONT></P>

   a producer (John Nolan) shows his newest production to a group of his 
   friends. It concerns the supposedly true story of how his ancestors 
   burned a witch at the stake 300 years earlier, causing her to curse 
   his family line. Past and present merge as a series of grisly murders 
   of the producer&#146;s friends take place, including a couple of 
   brutal stabbings, an impalement on a wrought iron fence and a 
   beheading by a falling pane of glass. The entire film plays as a 
   whodunit, as the viewer tries to figure out if the producer&#146;s 
   long-lost cousin (Carolyn Courage) is or isn&#146;t the murderer. The 
   final denouement makes everything that proceeds it seem moot, as the 
   burned witch makes an appearance and kills the producer and his

   assailant who ties her up and makes her watch as he disposes of her

   (Barbara Steele; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LongHairDeath1964">THE

   her husband, Jeronimus Hauff, which says he invited Albert to come to 
   the castle to draw up his will. Cleo says that can't be because her 
   husband died nearly a year ago and, in three days, it will be the

   father's death, but Cleo tells her to be quiet because she is being 
   foolish. Albert uses the phone to call his partner, but as soon as he 
   picks it up, it goes dead. Corrine then tells Albert that, 100 years 
   ago, the castle was used as a hospital to treat victims of the plague 
   and not one of them left the castle alive. She shows Albert some 
   mummified severed human hands and tells him that superstitious 
   villagers cut off the hands of plague victims so that they couldn't 
   touch anyone to spread the plague. She also says the plague victims 
   will rise from their graves in three days and come back to the 
   castle. The next day, Albert plans on leaving the castle, but his car 
   won't start. He finds an owl in the car's engine, forcing him to stay 
   until he can find someone to fix his car.&nbsp; He hears Corrine 
   scream and runs to see what is wrong. She tells Albert that she has 
   just seen her father. Albert also finds a recording (on a cylinder) 
   where Jeronimus Hauff says, &quot;I am one of them. I will return. I 
   summoned them from their graves, and now I have become one of

   mayer was good friends with her husband, but she hated him. We also 
   learn that the previous village physician was also friends with 
   Jeronimus and he, too, died a horrible death. The clerk gives Albert 
   a list of names of people in town who are cursed to die and their 
   only connection to each other is that they were friends with 
   Jeronimus. Albert thinks the clerk is loony and Dr. Nemek agrees, but 
   they will both soon learn that all the clerk told them will soon come 
   true. On the day of the first anniversary of Jeronimus's death, his

    This moody, well-crafted gothic horror film is very atmospheric and

   choke the life out of him) and what happens immediately after. 
   Director Massimo Pupillo (<B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#VengLadyMorgan1965">THE

   the black &amp; white cinematography, by Carlo Di Palma (credited on 
   the print as &quot;Charles Brown&quot;), who shot many of Woody 
   Allen's films of the '80s &amp; '90s, greatly sets the somber mood of 
   the film. Screenwriters Romano Migliorini (as &quot;Robin 
   McLorin&quot;; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightOfThe Devils72">NIGHT
    OF THE DEVILS</A></B> - 1972) and Roberto Natale (as &quot;Robert 
   Nathan&quot;; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#KillBabyKill1966">KILL, BABY...KILL!</A></B> 
   - 1966) have crafted a story (based on the writings of Edgar Allan 
   Poe) cloaked in shadowy mystery and unseen terror. While we never see 
   the dead come back to life (all we see are the dead's POV shots with 
   a hand-held camera and shadows of hands reaching for their intended 
   victims), there is such a forboding tone here, you won't care. 
   Sometimes the most frightening things are those we cannot see. If you 
   are going to watch this movie for Barbara Steele, be aware that she 
   has a supporting role here and is in the film for no more than ten 
   minutes, but she does make an impact, especially her death. There are 
   many effective and outright scary scenes in this film, including one 
   victim falling victim to the plague, where his face bubbles with puss 
   (very gross for its time), the collection of severed hands coming to 
   life, tombs in the graveyard opening by themselves and invisible feet 
   dragging across the graveyard's soil, making this a great film to 
   watch at night with the lights out.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   There's a double twist-ending that's telegraphed more than halfway 
   through the film, so all the viewer has to enjoy is the beheadings, 
   knifings, strangulations, crossbow arrow impalements and other mayhem 
   on view. The only problem is the film is shot so dark that it's hard 
   to make out anything that is going on. Most of the action takes place 
   at night and most of the scenes are underlit. Too bad, since some of 
   the murders are inventive and would be better appreciated if more 
   light were shown on the subject. Since this is one of the original 
   films to use a person in a Santa suit as the killer, this film does 
   get some credit, but Hess could have jazzed-up the proceedings by 
   making the killer more manic and, the film as a whole, more

   twisty Brazilian mountain road, when it crashes, stranding them in 
   the middle of nowhere. They manage to find a secluded beach with a 
   bar and party all night with the locals, only to wake up the next 
   morning to find out they were drugged and all their belongings 
   stolen. We then find out that the locals are in cahoots with a doctor 
   who uses the tourists that visit the <A HREF="turistas_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/turistas dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="121" HEIGHT="176" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>area

   for a black market human organ ring. The Swedish couple are the first 
   to be kidnapped, but when the locals stop to smoke some dope and the 
   Swedes try to escape, they are killed (one is hacked to death with a 
   machete and the other falls off the side of a cliff, graphically 
   splitting her head open on the way down). The doctor shows his 
   displeasure by shoving a skewer through one local's eye, killing him. 
   A local named Kiko (Agles Steib) offers to take the group to safe 
   shelter but, in reality, leads them on a long trek through the jungle 
   to the doctor's (his uncle's) house. They are all taken prisoner, as 
   we watch the doctor remove one of the girl's kidneys while she is 
   still awake. The other tourists break free and fight back when Kiko 
   has a change of heart (pardon the pun) and decides to help them 
   escape. The rest of the film is just one long torturous chase as the 
   doctor and his minions try to retrieve their prey before they make it

   I have to say that I'm not a big fan of this genre of film, 
   specifically, needlessly showing the prolonged torture of people 
   before finally putting them out of their misery. While 
   actor-turned-director John Stockwell (<B><A HREF="christine_1983.htm">CHRISTINE</A></B>

   get naked a lot), much of the violence is brutal to the point of 
   being unwatchable. I have nothing against violence in films (far from 
   it) but, in some instances, showing too much takes the artistry out 
   of the act, rendering it just sadism for sadism's sake. I know that 
   films like this have their fans, but I'm not one of them. <B><A HREF="turistas_2006b.htm">T</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="turistas_2006b.htm">U</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><A HREF="turistas_2006b.htm">RISTAS</A></B>

   seems the good doctor has been impregnating women with some

   the will states that he must have a child to inherit the cash (or so 
   he says). He brings the teen to his invalid mother&#146;s huge 
   mansion where she is to stay until the baby is born. Strange things 
   begin to happen. Dead fetuses are found buried in the woods, the teen 
   has visions of pregnant sex (or so she thinks),the entire Null family 
   acts very strange (especially Mom) and the maid likes to serve 
   drugged apple cider. Believe it or not, this all has to do with a 
   brand of Filipino vampires called the Aswang. They feed on the unborn

   realise that they may be next and try to stop the madness only to end 
   up as video fodder in the &quot;surprise&quot; ending. This film is 
   strictly amateur hour as it looks like it was shot with a camcorder 
   and the acting and effects are over-the-top. Limbs are hacked off, a 
   deli worker cuts a man's hand off and runs it through a meat slicer, 
   while his co-worker hacks off a woman's head and puts it in a soup

   Tayler [April Matson], is pregnant and hasn't told her boyfriend, 
   Nick [Eric Jay Beck; who wrote the screenplay and was one of the many 
   producers], yet) who pick up a woman named Diane (McKenzie Westmore) 
   at a gas station whose car has run out of gas. They agree to drive 
   her back to her car, only to be gassed unconscious by her and waking 
   up in an inescapable house with five other people. They all have 
   strange devices with tubes attached to the back of their heads and a 
   dikey big-toothed woman (Maria Olsen) appears on a television screen 
   and tells them that they have 21 hours to produce a certain amount of

    will die (When one of the men tries to detach the device from his 
   head in the beginning of the film, he dies). The eight remaining 
   people decide to take turns torturing each other according to numbers 
   they draw (from pieces of a broken plate written in one of the girl's 
   blood). The only problem is, if any of them end up dead, the 
   percentage drops and the rest of them have to pick up the violent 
   slack. One of the women, Kelly (Stefanie Barboza), is a little too 
   into torturing the rest of the abductees and nearly kills Greg (Rob 
   Kirkland), after jamming a screwdriver into his knee and breaking his 
   leg by slamming it against the edge of a table. The rest of the film 
   is nothing but one torture scene after the next, as fingernails are 
   ripped out with pliers, a cheese grater is used to tear flesh from 
   the body, a steam iron is used on another's stomach and people are 
   hit with a pipe wrench or sliced with a butcher knife. The most 
   satisfying part is when it is Kelly's turn. After all the pain she 
   has inflicted on the other abductees, she wimps out, forcing the rest 
   to tie her to a table, stick a metal rod between her teeth and then 
   slam the pipe wrench under her jaw, knocking out some of her teeth. 
   When the group finally reaches 100%, the toothy dike woman appears on 
   screen and tells them they are free to go, after they attach their 
   devices to a machine that appears out of the wall to collect the 
   liquids (which will be turned into pills that can fetch over $10,000 
   apiece). As they have their devices removed of the liquids one-by-one 
   and exit through the revolving turnstile-like door, it is revealed 
   that one of the abductees was in on the dastardly deed the entire 
   time (he has done this many times before and seems to get off on the 
   pain inflicted on him) and none of them were meant to make it out of 
   the house alive. He types something into a computer, releasing a 
   slow-acting poison into everyone's blood. Only Nick makes it out 
   alive (he finds the antidote) and the next time we see him, he is at 
   a diner across from the gas station in the beginning of the film, 
   waiting for Diane. He spots and follows her back to her car (she was 
   using the same ruse she used on Nick and his friends, only this time 
   her prey gets away), knocks her out and kidnaps her. What happens 
   next we may never know (but he &quot;fucking loves that song&quot; 
   playing on the car's radio). If you like torture porn, you may get a 
   kick out of this low-budget flick, directed by first-timer Taylor 
   Sheridan, an actor best known for his recurring role as &quot;Deputy 
   Chief David Hale&quot; on the TV series <B><A HREF="sons_of_anarchy_tv_series.htm">SONS
    OF ANARCHY</A></B> (2008 - 2014), who was killed-off on the show in

   to stay away, as the entire film is just an excuse to show people 
   torturing each other (under the pretext of social commentary) for 
   nearly 88 minutes. I know there are people out there who like this 
   sort of stuff, but I am not one of those people. To me, it is just an

    The film opens with husband and wife Lucy (Bettina Giovannini; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#MonsterFlorence1985">THE
    MONSTER OF FLORENCE</A></B> - 1985) and Giorgio Mainardi (Duilio Del 
   Prete; <B><A HREF="mystere_1983.htm">MYSTERE</A></B> - 1983) naked in 
   bed and having sex. Their young son David (Damiano Azzos) cries out 
   for his Mommy and Giorgio gets mad, grabs a knife, goes in David's 
   room and stabs him in the chest over and over, killing the young boy. 
   We then find out it was only a nightmare, as Lucy wakes up, goes to 
   David's room and finds him sleeping peacefully in his bed. 
   Unfortunately, Giorgio is not in great shape, for after the opening 
   credits (where a choir of children sing a song where the lyrics go 
   &quot;Ding Dong Dang Ding - Dong Ding Dong&quot;), we see he is at 
   the hospital, a doctor telling wife Lucy, stepmother Hilda (Frances 
   Nacmen) and stepbrother Mario (Pascal Persiano; <B><A HREF="#PaganiniHorror1988">PAGANINI
    HORROR</A></B> - 1989) that Giorgio is hemorrhaging and he will do 
   all he can to save him, but it's no use, as Giorgio starts puking up 
   blood and dies, but not before yelling out &quot;Why?&quot; and then 
   whispering something into the doctor's ear. We then hear Lucy cry out 
   &quot;Noooo!&quot; as the nurses pull the sheets over Giorgio's head.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The doctor needs Hilda's signature on a form so an autopsy can be 
   performed on Giorgio (this news rattles Lucy), but Hilda tells the 
   doctor to forget about it, because &quot;We won't ever allow such a 
   profanation.&quot; The doctor tells Hilda to resign herself to the 
   autopsy because it is the law and she shoots back, &quot;We'll see. 
   Obviously, you don't know who the Mainardi Family is or just how much 
   money they've given to this foundation. I happen to be the wife of a 
   very important man.&quot; As she is threatening the doctor, an 
   orderly is seen taking Giorgio's body away and we hear Giorgio's 
   innermost thoughts (from the Great Beyond), as he says, &quot;Why an 
   autopsy? What did they do to me?&quot; It's obvious that Giorgio 
   refuses to lie at rest until he finds out why.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Lucy arrives home, she opens the door and hears Giorgio's voice 
   say he will never rest in peace until he knows what happened, 
   promising that the guilty parties will pay. Lucy begins crying and 
   housekeeper Dorrie (Sacha Maria Darwin; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#MurderSecret1988">THE
    MURDER SECRET</A></B> - 1989) comes running to her, apologizing for 
   falling asleep with the television on (The TV news is playing archive 
   footage of Giorgio talking to members of a community counsel at a 
   meeting). Lucy is relieved, but when Hilda and Mario arrive home, 
   Hilda tells Lucy that there will be an autopsy, so Giorgio's funeral 
   will be delayed a couple of days. Lucy tells Hilda that someone 
   should call her and Giorgio's daughter, college student Rosy (Karina 
   Huff; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Demons6-1989">DEMONS 6: DE PROFUNDIS</A></B> 
   - 1989), and tell her that her father is dead and Hilda says she will 
   take care of it. Hilda then tells Mario to call Rosy at college while 
   she goes to the room that contains Giorgio's infirmed and 
   wheelchair-bound father (and her husband), the unable-to-speak Mr. 
   Mainardi (the late Paolo Paoloni; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#HauntingHelena2012">THE
    HAUNTING OF HELENA</A></B> - 2012) and rubs Giorgio's death in his 
   face, telling him (with a smile on her face), &quot;Your son is dead. 
   Your beloved Giorgio. Dead. You understand? Giorgio kicked the 
   bucket, Daddy. To everyone's joy, he finally dropped dead. Lucky you, 
   you don't even know what is going on.&quot; The look of sadness in 
   his eyes and the way he grips the armrest of his wheelchair tells a 
   different story, though.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The pathologist (a cameo by Lucio Fulci) performs the autopsy on 
   Giorgio (lots of gory autopsy footage). He cuts out a section of 
   Giorgio's colon and puts it in a glass jar of formaldehyde, telling 
   his assistant Gianni (Lorenzo Flaherty; <B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#Demons2-1986">DEMONS
    2</A></B> - 1986) that he will examine it on Monday. By the 
   examination of Giorgio's body, the pathologist says it looks like he 
   died a natural death. We then hear Giorgio say, &quot;Why must they 
   wait? If only I could insist they do it now, they'd see what it was 
   that killed me!&quot; So was it a natural death? Don't you believe 
   it! The Mainardi Family are a fucked-up bunch. When Mario phones Rosy 
   to give her the good...err, bad news, she jumps on the next train 
   home. She may be the only &quot;normal&quot; person in the Mainardi 
   Family, but since this is a Fulci film, looks can be deceiving.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Rosy arrives at the train station, where Mario and childhood friend 
   Gianni are waiting for her. Rosy basically ignores Mario and drives 
   back to the house with Gianni. It is apparent they have romantic 
   feelings for each other and when they arrive at the house, Hilda is 
   waiting, handing Rosy a single rose (this comes just after Hilda 
   orders Dorrie to throw out all of Giorgio's clothes, because she 
   needs the closet space!). Rosy then goes to mother Lucy and demands 
   to know what happened to her father. Lucy makes a lame excuse that no 
   one could believe and then orders Rosy to leave the room because 
   she's too tired to talk any further.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At his funeral, we hear Giorgio say, &quot;Words, words! Why does no 
   one bother to ask what really happened? Why am I here, laid out in 
   this box?&quot; We also hear a conversation in the church pews, where 
   a co-worker of Giorgio's says to another man, &quot;His death is very 
   accommodating for someone (Mario). I just asked him to sort out the 
   mess in my company. Another week and a bomb would have dropped and 
   blown everything wide open.&quot; As everyone walks up to the open 
   coffin to pay their respects, we see how Giorgio mistreated them in 
   the past (using flashbacks), proving that he was a total dick to 
   nearly everyone, including Rosy. This brings up an important 
   question. Who killed Giorgio? All of the people at the funeral have a 
   valid reason for doing so, including Giorgio's ex-lover Rita 
   (Antonella Tinazzo; <B><A HREF="domino_1988.htm">DOMINO</A></B> - 
   1988), whom he &quot;cast out&quot; of his life shortly before he 
   died. It is apparent Giorgio was extremely cruel to everyone, but he 
   doesn't believe he is dead and thinks only Rosy can save him. After 
   Giorgio is buried in the family tomb, Rosy is disgusted with the way 
   everyone talks about her father and his fortune. She tells them that 
   Giorgio is alive in the house and judging everyone by their actions. 
   Strange things begin happening in the house, like all of Giorgio's 
   clothes returning to the closet (but there is an explanation for 
   that) and a portrait of Giorgio seemingly coming to life. The ghost 
   of Giorgio pays Rosy a visit and he asks her to help him find out how 
   he died. He also tells her that her memory of him will disappear when 
   his body begins decomposing, so time is limited unless she discovers 
   how he died and who killed him (every so often, the camera takes us 
   to Giorgio's tomb, where we see his body in various stage of 
   decomposition). We then discover that the autopsy cannot continue, 
   because the section of Giorgio's colon was tainted when the glass jar 
   containing it mysteriously fell to the floor and broke. Oh, yes, we 
   then discover that Lucy and Mario are having an affair for quite some 
   time and Lucy's son David may not be Giorgio's (Which may be the 
   reason Lucy had the nightmare at the beginning of the film). When 
   they are sleeping together, Mario has a nightmare where all the 
   bodies in the Mainardi family tomb come back to life as zombies and 
   attack him. You think he has a guilty conscience? At the reading of 
   his will, Giorgio leaves everything to Rosy, completely ignoring 
   everyone else, including his son David (he may have known he wasn't 
   his son), which greatly upsets everyone else.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Gianni tells Rosy that glass was found in the autopsy sample, but it 
   was ground glass, quite unlike the glass jar that held the sample. It 
   seem someone fed Giorgio ground glass in his food, which is why he 
   hemorrhaged and died. Rosy discovers it turns out to be glass from a 
   light bulb, which young David ground to a fine granule for his 
   mother, thinking it was part of a joke! Rosy then starts an 
   investigation on who killed her <A HREF="voices_from_beyond_1991.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/voices from beyond italy dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>father,
    starting with Rita. Can Rosy discover who the murderer is before it 
   is too late and her father's body is nothing but bones, her memory of 
   him no longer in her brain? Her investigation leads to an attempt on 
   her life, as someone poisons her drink, but Gianni saves her before 
   she drinks it. Think you know who it is? Good, because I'm not going

   nudity. The late <A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_3.htm#PaoloPaoloni">Paolo

   Giorgio, proving that his son was also cruel to him, but a father's 
   love goes beyond that. This film also has a good plot, which as I 
   mentioned before is unusual for a Fulci film, as he usually lets the 
   blood and gore do the talking. The late <A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_3.htm#StelvioCipriani">Stelvio

   Fulci, in a career that spanned over 240 movies! Fulci must have been 
   angry when making this film, because before the end credits appear, 
   it says, <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;This film is dedicated to my few

    Dr. Julian Olcott (Carl Schell; <B><A HREF="blue_max_1966.htm">THE 
   BLUE MAX</A></B> - 1966) arrives at the front gate of an institute 
   for troubled girls to start is new job, where he is met by caretaker 
   Walter Jeoffrey (Luciano Pigozzi, once again using his &quot;Alan 
   Collins&quot; pseudonym; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#WhipAndTheBody1963">THE
    WHIP AND THE BODY</A></B> - 1963) and his dog, Wolf. Walter gives 
   Julian directions to Director Swift's office and as Julian passes a 
   group of girls doing morning calestectics, student Mary (Mary 
   McNeeran) passes out when the handsome Julian walks by her (the other 
   girls think Mary is faking to get Julian's attention). Julian then 
   meets headmistress Leonore MacDonald (Grace Neame) and she escorts 
   him to the Director's office. Director Swift (Curt Lowens; <B><A HREF="mephisto_waltz_1971.htm">THE
    MEPHISTO WALTZ</A></B> - 1971) knows all about Julian's past legal 
   problems, Julian reminding him that he was acquitted of all charges 
   in a court of law. The Director assures him that no one in this 
   institute will know about his past; here he will be known simply as 
   &quot;Professor Julian Olcott, science teacher.&quot; When Julian 
   asks about the girl who passed out in front of him, the Director 
   tells him that this institute is a place for girls with troubled 
   pasts to redeem themselves and find a career to better their futures. 
   Mary is one of those girls, but her past is a complete mystery to the staff.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That night, Mary sneaks out of her dorm room and heads towards the 
   surrounding woods (Leonore sees her, but doesn't try to stop her), 
   where she is caught by Walter. She threatens Walter, saying she'll 
   spill the beans&nbsp; about what she knows about him and the other 
   &quot;man&quot;, so Walter lets her go. She then meets the 
   institute's benefactor, Sir Alfred Whiteman (Maurice Marsac; <B><A HREF="poseidon_adventure_1972.htm">THE
    POSEIDON ADVENTURE</A></B> - 1972), in the middle of the woods and 
   threatens to tell the police that he is having underage sex with her 
   if he doesn't free her from the institute, saying she has the letters 
   he sent her as proof. Sir Alfred tells her only the court can free 
   her since it was they who sent her here and he then nervously walks 
   away. When Sir Alfred leaves, Mary is chased by a werewolf-like 
   creature and when it catches her, she is mauled to death and her dead 
   body thrown in the river. When her body is found, a nameless Police 
   Inspector (Herbert Diamonds) questions the staff at the institute, 
   but he doesn't believe any of them are responsible because the 
   coroner said that Mary was killed by some wild animal. Student 
   Priscilla (Barbara Lass; real name: Barbara Kwiatkowska, better known 
   as Roman Polanski's first wife) finds the incriminating letters in 
   Mary's locked drawer and goes to the Director to tell him, but Walter 
   stops and threatens her to keep silent about the matter. Not one for 
   being threatened, Priscilla tells Director Swift that Mary was 
   blackmailing someone. The Police Inspector wants to see the letters, 
   but Priscilla discovers that someone has taken them from Mary's 
   drawer. The Police Inspector once again states that the killer 
   couldn't possibly be the person that Mary was blackmailing because 
   Mary was killed by a wild animal. He couldn't be more wrong.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Priscilla and fellow student Brunhilde (Maureen O'Connor) unlock 
   another drawer in Mary's dormitory and find more letters, all 
   basically saying the same thing (i.e. &quot;I'll give you everything 
   you want, Mary, but I need you to give me the letters. I'll do 
   anything you want. I love you.&quot;), but all the letters are 
   unsigned. Priscilla tells Brunhilde that no one else should see the 
   letters because she knows who wrote them. She has a plan to expose 
   Mary's killer, not knowing that someone at the institute is actually 
   a werewolf.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After a week teaching at the institute, Julian asks Director Swift 
   what some of the girls did to get themselves sent to the institute. 
   Brunhilde, it turns out, was convicted of attempted murder. She lived 
   with Mary on the outside and when one of Mary's johns, a sailor, 
   tried to strangle Mary, Brunhilde attacked the sailor and nearly 
   killed him. It's also apparent that Walter is somehow involved in 
   this sordid affair, acting like a pimp and supplying institute girls 
   to members of the male staff. That night, he escorts Brunhilde 
   through the woods and leads her to a shack, saying, &quot;He is 
   expecting you.&quot; He pushes Brunhilde inside and locks the door 
   behind her. Expecting to meet Sir Alfred, Brunhilde is confronted by 
   his wife, Sheena (Annie Steinert), who throws a wad of cash on the 
   table, telling Brunhilde that she and her husband are through seeing 
   each other. Brunhilde accuses Sir Alfred of being Mary's killer, but 
   Sheena says her husband may be a sexual sadist, but he's no murderer. 
   She knows for a fact that Mary was alive when her husband left her 
   the night she was killed, because she was spying on him. Brunhilde 
   then accuses Sheena of being the killer, but she tells Brunhilde that 
   she is being ridiculous and walks out of the shack. As Brunhilde is 
   walking back to the institute, she runs into Julian, who tells her he 
   was laying traps for wolves. When Sheena gets home, someone knocks 
   her out with chloroform and then injects her in the arm with a 
   poison, killing her. Brunhilde is attacked at the front gate by the 
   werewolf, but Walter's dog Wolf saves her, biting hard on the 
   werewolf's right arm and making the werewolf run away. When Julian 
   visits Brunhilde in the institute's infirmary, Priscilla arrives and 
   playfully squeezes Julian's right arm, causing him to wince in pain. 
   Priscilla then goes to Director Swift and accuses Julian of being the 
   killer, telling him that the murders only began once Julian arrived 
   at the institute. The Director tells Priscilla to be quiet, he will 
   question Julian and contact the police if necessary.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Under questioning, Julian tells Director Swift a wild story about 
   his past legal problems when he was a medical doctor. One of his 
   patients, a woman, claimed to be a &quot;Lycanthropus&quot;, not 
   quite human, not quite a werewolf, but still a cold-blooded killer. 
   Julian tried to find a cure for her condition, but she attacked him, 
   permanently damaging his right arm and he accidentally killed her. He 
   was brought to court on charges of murder, but found not guilty by a 
   jury of his peers. Julian believes the killer at the institute is 
   also a Lycanthropus and he may have come up with a formula to cure 
   the affliction. When Walter is caught red-handed trying to smother 
   Brunhilde in bed with a pillow, he tries to escape, only for Julian 
   to fire a pistol at him, causing Walter to fall to his death from the 
   roof one of the institute's buildings. Everyone believes Walter was 
   the killer and the nightmare is finally over, but Julian doesn't 
   believe it because Walter owned a dog and dogs are Lycanthropus worst 
   enemies. Julian and Priscilla confront Sir Alfred and accuse him of 
   being the killer, but he denies it, walking into his bedroom and 
   blowing his brains out with a pistol! Think you know who the killer 
   is? Here's another clue: Walter's dog, Wolf, viciously kills Leonore 
   by tearing her apart with his teeth. At Walter's funeral, Wolf nearly 
   attacks and kills Director Swift. That night, Wolf leads Priscilla to 
   a shallow grave in the woods and begins digging with his paws, 
   revealing the body of...Walter! So who was buried in Walter's coffin? 
   I hope you have it figured out because I'm not revealing another thing!</FONT></FONT><BR>

   giallo film of all time, as well as many, many more. This was 
   Gastaldi's first credited screenplay and, thankfully, he is still 
   around to regale us with stories of how it was like to work in the 
   Italian horror film business during its Golden Age. On Severin's DVD 
   &amp; Blu-Ray of this title, one of the extras on the discs has 
   Gastaldi telling us how he came up with the name &quot;Julian 
   Berry&quot; (there were laws in Italy that prevented Gastaldi and 
   other people, from using their real names), what it was like working 
   with Paolo Heusch (who passed away in 1982) and his experiences 
   working in the horror and giallo genres. Somebody should make a 
   documentary on Gastaldi before it is too late, as he is a wealth of 
   unknown, entertaining stories that will disappear when he does from 
   this mortal coil. It's a no-brainer, as he has worked with the best 
   in the business. The Italian cut of this film differs from the 
   American version in many ways. The dialogue is more sexually frank 
   and adult, the violent scenes are extended by a few frames and it 
   doesn't have that ridiculous song, &quot;The Ghoul In School&quot;, 
   that opens up the re-titled American version (it is available as an 
   extra on Severin's discs, as are both the Italian and American 
   trailers for this film). I have to say that I enjoyed this film much 
   more than I thought I would, even after not watching it for over 
   fifty years, thanks to the spotless print Severin supplied me in it's 
   OAR. The yellow English subtitles for the Italian language version 
   was also a nice touch. Everything Severin does is first class all the 
   way, even for this Public Domain film (although I doubt the Italian 
   cut is PD).</FONT></FONT><BR>

   to meet him at the pick-up point; a bed &amp; breakfast where the 
   good Father will be spending the night. As the four teens are 
   walking, they are suddenly joined by Lee (Martin Compton; <B><A HREF="doomsday_2008.htm">DOOMSDAY</A></B> 
   - 2008; <B><A HREF="strippers_vs_werewolves_2012.htm">STRIPPERS VS. WEREWOLVES</A></B> 
   - 2012), who just happens to be the teen who knocked-up Kelly Ann. As 
   nighttime falls and the five teens have set-up camp, Kelly Ann steps 
   away to take a pee and is nearly assaulted by a shepherd (Alan 
   McHugh) that they all met earlier. The other teens chase him away and 
   he is attacked and has his throat torn open (very bloody) by a 
   growling creature. Kelly Ann discovers a crying baby in a seemingly 
   abandoned stone castle that stinks of rotting flesh (she also sees 
   the shepherd's dismembered corpse), so she grabs it and heads back to 
   camp. Not long after, the creature attacks and kills Mark (all we see 
   are his intestines wrapped around his flashlight) and then Louise. 
   The three teens and the baby head back to the abandoned castle to try 
   and find answers (even Scottish teens are stupid), only to discover 
   that it is home to a family of werewolves. The trio kill one of the 
   werewolves with homemade spears (Is that supposed to work?), but 
   another werewolf bites David's head off. Kelly Ann and Lee escape 
   with the baby and hide from the approaching werewolf by climbing a 
   tree (Werewolves can't climb trees? I'm learning something new every 
   day!). As morning comes, Lee jumps out of the tree and runs away so 
   the werewolf will follow him. Kelly Ann, carrying the baby, runs in 
   the opposite direction as she hears Lee's final death throe screams. 
   The werewolf then begins to follow Kelly Ann, but she meets a farmer 
   riding a quad bike. A werewolf bursts out of a dead corpse of one of 
   the farmer's steers and bites the farmer in half (the film's gory 
   highlight, as we see his ribcage as he collapses in two pieces on the 
   ground). Kelly Ann takes the quad bike and drives it to the bed &amp; 
   breakfast, where we discover Father Steve sleeping with the female 
   proprietor Missy (Karen Fraser, who, after finding out he is a 
   priest, scarcastically says to him, &quot;If I'm pregnant, you're 
   paying for the abortion!&quot;). After calling the police, Missy lets 
   Kelly Ann have a room until they arrive. Father Steve doesn't believe 
   a word of her story, accusing her of stealing the baby and ditching 
   her friends. Father Steve will soon becaome a believer all too late, 
   as he watches a werewolf devour Missy and we discover that Kelly Ann 
   has always been a werewolf, too. She kills Father Steve and in some 
   of the worst CGI in history, the final shot shows two werewolves 
   walking through a meadow, while a baby werewolf prances around 
   them.&nbsp; My god, this film is one giant pile of crap. The thick 
   Scottish accents will have you turning on the optional English 
   subtitles just to understand what they are saying. Since most of the 
   action takes place at night, it is hard to really see what is going 
   on and you'll be doing a lot of squinting, but you still won't see 
   anything. The worst part of this film are the werewolves themselves. 
   They are the fakest, laugh-out-loud kind. They walk on all fours and 
   have large rubber faces where only the jaw moves. When there is any 
   expression by them, it is obviously done with CGI. Also frustrating 
   is how the werewolvess are able to keep their form in broad daylight, 
   as this film runs contrary to all werewolf mythos. The practical 
   makeup effects, by Bob Keen (who tried his hand at directing, making <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Proteus1995">PROTEUS</A></B> 
   - 1995; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Heartstopper2006">HEARTSTOPPER</A></B> 
   - 2006; and others) are very bloody and well done, but they are few 
   and far between. It doesn't surprise me that this is 
   director/screenwriter Craig Strachman's only feature film (up till 
   the time of this review). Even at 73 minutes, it seems twice as long 
   and the slow-moving end credits (where Sam The Sham And The Pharaohs' 
   &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; can be heard) takes up five 
   minutes of screen time, making the film really only 68 minutes long. 
   Most of the acting is average, but it was really difficult me to 
   judge because of their heavy accents. Peter Capaldi (<B><A HREF="lair_of_the_white_worm_1988.htm">THE
    LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM</A></B> - 1988) is really the only pro on 
   hand here, even winning an Academy Award&#153; in 1995 for

    EVIL DEAD</A></B> (1981) than it is a total rip-off. Everything, 
   from locations, situations and even the clothing, mirror that film. 
   It is also heavy on gore and light on plot. Seven young adults go to 
   a secluded cabin in the woods for a weekend to unwind, but something 
   far more deadly is waiting for them. Loving couple Albin (Patrik 
   Almkvist; this film's &quot;Ash&quot;) and Ida (Lisa Henni) take 
   their friends Markus (Max Wallmo), Linnea (Amanda Renberg), Marie 
   (Jessica Blomkvist), Tove (Anna Henriksson) and Ida's 
   nothing-but-trouble brother Simon (Patrick Saxe) for a weekend of 
   drinking and sex to a cabin Albin's<A HREF="wither_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wither poster4b small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   father, Olof (Ralf Beck), found them. They have to park their cars a 
   mile away from the cabin&nbsp; and make the walk, where they run into 
   a rifle-carrying Gunnar (Johannes Brost), who we saw in the beginning 
   of the film shooting a zombie-looking young woman (it turns out to be 
   his daughter), who is chowing down on a boy. Gunnar stares at them 
   and walks away. When the group get to the cabin (it has three front 
   doors, but it is never explained why), it is locked and no one has 
   the key. Albin tries to pick one of the locks, not knowing that 
   Markus found an open window in the back, where Marie enters. Marie 
   walks through the house with a lit candle (that changes in length 
   from scene-to-scene) and she finds a trap door that leads to the 
   cellar. Rather than opening the front door for her friends, she goes 
   down to the cellar and when she comes back up, it is plain to see 
   that she is a changed person. Albin successfully picks the lock and 
   everyone enters the cabin, not knowing that they will not able to 
   leave it alive. Almost immediately, Marie changes from a normal woman 
   into some creature (she pisses blood and her eyes turn white), who 
   bites off the upper lip of Tove, exposing her upper teeth and gums 
   (the best effect in the film). From this point on, it is a pure gore 
   film that tosses all logic out the window. Gunnar enters the cabin, 
   where he tells the panic survivors about creatures that live beneath 
   the ground. If you stare into their eyes, they take your soul and you 
   turn into one of them. Anyone who turns into one of these creature 
   can infect you if they bleed on you or scratch you. Oh, and they are 
   very hard to kill (This is the part that makes no sense. Some 
   creatures are easy to kill, while some seem indestructible). One by 
   one, the young adults start turning into these creatures and begin 
   attacking the others until only Albin and Ida are left. The film ends 
   with Albin the only survivor. He exits the cabin and walks away. 
   First the positive points: The film is bloody as hell, as people get 
   their heads cut off, their faces beaten into a bloody pulp, large 
   drill bits impaled in their heads or stabbed repeatedly. Most of the 
   effects are done very well. Now the bad points: The script makes 
   little sense. Their cell phones work and Albin even calls the police, 
   but they never show up or even call back. There is an over-reliance 
   of noticeable CGI, especially the scene where Markus gets a large 
   drill bit shoved through the back of his head and it exits out his 
   mouth. Another bad point is that one method of death may work for one 
   creature, but not for another. When the film opens, Gunnar shoots his 
   creature daughter through the head and she gets up, but when Gunnar 
   kills himself (by putting his rifle barrel into his mouth and pulling 
   the trigger, blowing the back of his head off) he doesn't come back 
   as a creature, even though he was bitten. If it's gore you want, look 
   no further. But if you want to have a film that makes at least some 
   kind of sense, look somewhere else. Directed by the team of Sonny 
   Laguna &amp; Tommy Wiklund, both also responsible for the films <B><A HREF="we_are_monsters_2015.htm">WE

    I decide to search my library of VHS tapes to come up with a film 
   not yet released on DVD or Blu-Ray. Hell, this film wasn't even 
   available on legitimate VHS! I purchased this from Video Search of 
   Miami (remember them?) over 30 years ago. VSOM was not known for 
   quality reproduction (their idea of &quot;mint condition&quot; 
   wouldn't get a C+ from most viewers), but I decided to wipe the 
   cobwebs off my VCR and watch this sleazy soap opera with moments of 
   nudity &amp; violence. This was originally paired with <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Night Bloody Horror">NIGHT
    OF BLOODY HORROR</A></B> (1969), which also featured some of the 
   same actors, as well as the same director and was released by Howco 
   International (I originally saw this in 1973 as part of Howco's 
   triple feature, which also included <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#NightOfTheStrangler">NIGHT
    OF THE STRANGLER</A></B> [1972]). Married Lauren Worthington 
   (Georgine Darcy) can't keep it in her panties, especially when her 
   older husband (Len Swenson) leaves on a long business trip. She picks 
   up a young man in a bar, who is being beaten mercilessly by the 
   bartender, a balding fat man. She kicks the fat guy in the balls and 
   takes the young guy home. He asks Lauren if she is married and she 
   says yes. He then asks if she loves her husband and she says yes. He 
   then asks, &quot;Why do you do this?&quot; and she answers, 
   &quot;Because he makes me feel old.&quot; She screws his brains out 
   and when he wakes up the following morning, he find a note on the 
   table that says she has to go to a &quot;stupid&quot; party. She then 
   continues with: &quot;I wish you could come. To the party I 
   mean!&quot; At the party, Lauren picks up another young man and 
   screws his brains out. Lauren doesn't know it, but she is being 
   followed around by Jerry (Marcus J. Grapes; <B><A HREF="keep_off_my_grass_1972.htm">KEEP
    OFF MY GRASS!</A></B> - 1972), a parking lot jockey who has the hots 
   for her. Every time Lauren parks her Cadillac, Jerry makes sure he 
   takes over, making lurid advances at her that she finds disgusting. 
   One day, Jerry knocks on her front door,<A HREF="women_and_bloody_terror_1970.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/women and bloody terror-night of bloody horror ad mat10 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   forces his way inside and tries to rape Lauren, but she gets away, 
   getting her husband's pistol and scaring Jerry half to death (she 
   puts a bullet between his leg and he thinks that she just hot him in 
   the nuts, but she missed purposely!). Jerry is not about to let her 
   get away with this. That afternoon is Lauren's teenage daughter 
   Karen's (Christina Hart; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#JohnnyFirecloud">JOHNNY
    FIRECLOUD</A></B> - 1975) birthday. We first see Karen topless in 
   the pool with new boyfriend Terrance (Gerald McRaney; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#AmericanJustice">AMERICAN
    JUSTICE</A></B> - 1985; with a full head of hair!). She covers up 
   when Mom suddenly appears (she wants Mom to think she is still a 
   virgin!), but it is apparently clear that Lauren has the hots for 
   Terrance. At Karen's birthday party, Terrance burns himself on the 
   arm cooking burgers, so Mom sends Karen to the drug store for some 
   burn ointment (she already has some under the bathroom sink 
   cabinet!). While Karen is away. Lauren has Terrance take off his 
   shirt so she can &quot;treat&quot; him better. Over Terrance's muted 
   objections, they make love. When Karen gets home, Terrance suddenly 
   says that they shouldn't see each other any more and Karen grows 
   suspicious, especially when she discovers the burn ointment under the 
   sink. That night, Lauren has a psychedelic nightmare where all of her 
   young conquests suddenly appear and want to make love. Lauren then 
   has a nightmare that explains why she is so horny: Her father catches 
   a teenage Lauren making love to some hot young stud and beats her 
   silly with his belt. Lauren wakes up and says, &quot;This has to 
   stop!&quot;. Meanwhile, Jerry is waiting for his co-worker Zool 
   (Michael Anthony) to show up at the parking lot and when he does, 
   Jerry explains what happened between him and Lauren. Zool comes up 
   with a plan to get even. He doesn't take too kindly that his best 
   friend had a gun pulled on him (I guess attempted rape is 
   acceptable!). Lauren calls up Terrance and they meet at a drive-in 
   fast food joint. Karen is out with her girlfriends and sees Mom in 
   the car with Terrance. Mom tells Terrance that he must forget about 
   their tryst and get back together with her daughter. Terrance drives 
   Lauren home, but on the way, they are run off the road by Zool and 
   Jerry (who are on motorcycles). Terrance crashes into a tree, his 
   head going through the windshield and he dies. Jerry takes Terrance 
   and an unconcious Lauren's driver licenses and he and Zool take off. 
   When Lauren wakes up and sees that Terrance is dead, she screams and 
   runs home. The phone then rings. It is Jerry and he threatens to go 
   to the police (Lauren fled the scene of an accident) unless she 
   delivers cash and jewels to an address he gives her. Unfortunately, 
   Karen overhears the conversation and follows Mom after she empties 
   her husband's safe of all the money and jewelry inside it. Lauren 
   shows up at the address and Jerry knocks her out. Karen then arrives 
   and Zool knocks her out. Both mother and daughter are raped at the 
   same time in adjoining bedrooms. A young couple hear Karen's screams 
   and call the police. When the police arrive (The whole force arrives 
   just because someone heard a woman scream?!?), Zool and Jerry try to 
   escape, but they are gunned down. Lauren sees her daughter's abused, 
   naked body in the other bedroom, coddles her and says, &quot;I'm 
   sorry!&quot; THE END. Impossibly dated, in hairstyles, clothing and 
   language, this film could have only come from the late-'60s - 
   early-'70s. It contains a freak-out scene with twirling camerawork, 
   gel lighting and sappy love ballads, something that was common in 
   low-budget films from this period. Filmed in New Orleans by director 
   Joy N. Houck Jr. (the previously mentioned <B>NIGHT OF BLOODY HORROR </B>[also
    with McRaney and Anthony]<B>&nbsp;</B> and <B>NIGHT OF THE STRANGLER</B>,
    as well as <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Creature Black Lake">CREATURE
    FROM BLACK LAKE</A></B> [1976] and <B><A HREF="brain_machine_1977.htm">THE
    BRAIN MACHINE</A></B> [1977]), with a screenplay by Houck, J.J. 
   Milane, Producer Albert J. Salzer &amp; Cinematographer Robert A. 
   Weaver, this film must have been shocking back in the day, but today 
   it wouldn't even make a good TV movie. One thing that it does have in 
   its favor is an atmosphere of sleaze, something which can not be 
   duplicated today. As I said before, this film was never released in 
   any format on home video and is hard to find, but, who knows? If <B>STRANGLER</B> 
   could get an OAR release on DVD (From <A HREF="http://www.vinegarsyndrome.com">Vinegar
    Syndrome</A> and <A HREF="http://www.americangenrefilm.com">AGFA</A>)
    and then be shown on Turner Classic Movies (TCM), there is still 
   hope for this one! Also starring Cheryl Rodrigue, Lance Gordon,

    Police officer Nicola Levi (Leonardo Treviglia; <B><A HREF="phantom_of_the_opera_1998.htm">PHANTOM
    OF THE OPERA</A></B> - 1998) sees his wife, Sara (Barbara Scoppa), 
   coming out of a restaurant with another man so, that afternoon, he 
   accuses her of cheating on him, which turns into a loud violent 
   fight, Sara stabbing him in the shoulder with an ice pick. Nicola 
   pulls the ice pick out of his shoulder and nearly drowns his wife in 
   the kitchen sink, which is full of dirty dishwater, but he comes to 
   his senses and storms out of the house.&nbsp; A short time later, 
   someone wearing black leather gloves (what else?) viciously stabs 
   Sara to death while she is taking a shower (another all-too-common 
   giallo trope).&nbsp; Nicola, not knowing his wife is dead, goes to 
   his former lover, criminal psychologist Anna Berardi (Valeria 
   D'Obici; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#BronxWarriors2">BRONX 
   WARRIORS 2</A></B> - 1983), and tells her something is wrong with 
   him, as he just nearly killed his wife. Just at that moment, Anna 
   gets a phone call from Police Inspector Piero Terzi (Paolo Malco; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NewYorkRipper1982">THE
    NEW YORK RIPPER</A></B> - 1982), who tells her that Sara is dead and 
   Nicola is the prime suspect and she should come to the crime scene. 
   Anna asks Nicola if he killed his wife (she doesn't tell him that his 
   wife is dead) during the argument and he says no, he left their house 
   before he acted on his violent urges. Anna believes Nicola and says 
   she will help him. Meanwhile, a violent serial killer <A HREF="youll_die_at_midnight_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/you'll die at midnight sweden vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>is
    on the loose in Rome, whom Anna has dubbed the &quot;Midnight 
   Killer&quot; (one of this film's multiple alternate titles), since he 
   kills young women and young women only (but, strangely, none of them 
   at midnight!), The Inspector and the rest of the police force think 
   Nicola is the Midnight Killer since Sara was killed in the same 
   manner as the serial killer's other victims. Surprisingly, Nicola is 
   gunned down by Inspector Terzi fairly early in the film, so Anna must 
   prove to Terzi that Nicola wasn't the Midnight Killer. She has 
   created a profile on the serial killer and believes it is a man named 
   Franco Tribbo, who was one of Anna's patients years earlier when she 
   practiced psychiatry, but the police, especially Inspector Terzi, are 
   unable and unwilling to find him (Terzi tells Anna that Franco Tribbo 
   died when Nicola did, because they are one in the same person). The 
   rest of the film details Anna's efforts to prove Nicola innocent, as 
   the Midnight Killer stalks Terzi's wife, Carol (Lara Wendel; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Zomb5KillingBirds87">ZOMBIE
    5: KILLING BIRDS</A></B> - 1987) and her female friends. Terzi will 
   finally have to believe Anna, as the serial killer begins murdering 
   some of his wife's female friends, but he will be in for a big 
   surprise when the serial killer is unmasked.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I'll give Lamberto Bava this, killing Nicola early in the film took 
   me by surprise, as I thought this was going to be a &quot;prove I 
   didn't do it&quot; kind of scenario, but the sad fact is the rest of 
   the film is a fairly generic giallo flick and the story is 
   interchangeable with the worst of them out there, which is 
   surprising, since the normally excellent Dardano Sacchetti (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Psychic1977">THE
    PSYCHIC</A></B> - 1977; <B><A HREF="beyond_1981.htm">THE BEYOND</A></B> 
   - 1981) co-wrote the screenplay with Bava. It is obvious that 
   Sacchetti was working on autopilot here, turning in a below-average 
   script full of giallo clich&eacute;s, just for the paycheck. The 
   killings are unimaginative and pat, as one scene shows the Midnight 
   Killer, who is dressed all in black, complete with a hood (to hide 
   his face, even though he is wearing a mask!), using a handheld 
   electric mixer to kill Carol's friend Monica (Eliana Hoppe; Bava's <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Demons1985">DEMONS</A></B> 
   - 1985). It is all done off-screen, so why bother? This film also has 
   the habit of painting every male character as being the Midnight 
   Killer, even Inspector Terzi, but we all know by now that they are 
   all nothing but red herrings. Add to that rooms and outside locations 
   full of smoke and fog (even in the afternoon!), mainly for 
   &quot;atmosphere&quot; and you can see how desperate the film is to 
   try and entertain us. Yet it all rings rather hollow, as it is 
   nothing we haven't seen dozens of times before and done much better 
   than this. The more I watch the career of Lamberto Bava, the more I 
   can see him digressing as a director as the years progress, as he 
   made two lesser giallo films after this, <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#DeliriumGioia1987">DELIRIUM:
    PHOTO OF GIOIA</A></B> (1987) and <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#BodyPuzzle1992">BODY
    PUZZLE</A></B> (1992), and yet, they won't make you groan as loud as 
   this one when the Midnight Killer is finally unmasked (Warning <B>SPOILERS!!!</B>).
    Yes, the serial Killer is Anna, as we find out that years ago, 
   Franco Tribbo raped her when he was her patient, making her quit 
   being a psychiatrist and turning her into a serial killer! I know I 
   don't usually give away the killer's identity in my reviews of giallo 
   films, but you will thank me once you realize that I just saved you 
   88 minutes of your precious time. Even Bava's TV films, including <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#GraveyardDisturb88">GRAVEYARD

   makes them appear to be African Americans! The Mafia, of course, 
   blames the thefts on a local black gang and a small race war ensues. 
   The vets, who take their orders from a one-armed, scar-faced platoon 
   leader (who has to press an electronic device to his neck to speak), 
   bask in their achievements (hey, not only are they rich, they&#146;re 
   also ridding the town of criminal elements!) until one of them is 
   captured and their identities are found out. It is rather obvious 
   that black actors were used to portray the vets during the robberies, 
   but that is a minor quibble. The film moves at a quick pace and is 
   full of death and destruction, including some Sam Peckinpah-inspired 
   slo-mo shootings and an impalement by forklift. Add to that a truly 
   surprising conclusion and you have a film worth an overnight rental.

   A research facility accidentally unleashes an experimental formula 
   into the air, turning the population (including the animals) of a 
   nearby town into flesh-eating zombies (filmed in the Philippines). A 
   ragtag group of tourists must fend off the zombies as well as the 
   militia sent in by the government to shoot anything that moves. This 
   is just a really long chase film filled with the extreme gore you 
   expect from this type of film. Plenty of entrail-ripping, 
   gut-munching, head explosions, dismemberments and bullet hits. 
   Directed by Lucio Fulci and Vincent Dawn (a.k.a. Bruno Mattei), who 
   filled in for Fulci when he got seriously ill (That was the 
   scuttlebutt. In actuality, Fulci finished &quot;his&quot; film, but 
   when it was edited, it was only 70 minutes long. Producer Franco 
   Gaudenzi cut 20 minutes from it [for pacing reasons] and asked Fulci 
   if he wanted to shoot more scenes and Fulci told him that 
   &quot;his&quot; film was finished. Gaudenzi then hired Mattei and 
   Claudio Fragasso to flesh out the film [Mattei was already in the 
   Philippines filming <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Robowar">ROBOWAR</A></B> 
   and Fragasso's wife, Rossella Drudi, wrote the original screenplay,

    open the door to Hell and are chased by the flesh-eating living 
   dead. If it's gore you want, this film will satisfy. If it's plot you 
   want, look somewhere else (Here's the plot in a nutshell: Twenty 
   years ago, a team of scientists were working on a plant-based 
   medicine used by voodoo priests to create a cure-all for cancer. When 
   they test it out on a young native female dying of leukemia and she 
   dies, her father, a voodoo priest, opens the Gates Of Hell, which 
   will fill the island with zombies to kill the scientists, who he 
   blames for his daughter's death. The only person to escape was a 
   three-year-old girl named Jenny, the daughter of the head scientist. 
   In the present, a fully-grown Jenny returns to the island to find out 
   what happened to her mother and father, accompanied by a squad of 
   pot-smoking mercenaries on vacation (?). Three scientists also are on 
   the island looking to discover what exactly happened on the island 
   twenty years ago. When one of the stupid scientists finds The Book Of 
   The Dead and recites the four words that would re-open the Gates Of 
   Hell, the survivors of both groups merge to fight an onslaught of 
   zombies who have escaped from Hell. Everyone dies in the end, all 
   turning into zombies. That's the entire plot!). Also starring Jeff
