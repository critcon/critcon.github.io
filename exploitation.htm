   Lame Italian WWII war flick which, for about 45 minutes, veers off 
   into the Naziploitation genre that those spaghetti-benders were so 
   fond of during the mid-to-late 70's (hence, it's inclusion here). The 
   plot concerns a platoon of American and British soldiers, led by 
   Major Lexman (Richard Harrison), who are sent to the Middle East to 
   blow up a Nazi fuel depot. They complete their task, but are captured 
   and sent to a P.O.W. camp in the middle of the African desert, run by 
   nasty SS Captain von Stolzen (Gordon Mitchell), who is so mean he 
   orders a man to be whipped even though he is dead. There's also the 
   Ilsa-like <A HREF="achtung_desert_tigers_1977.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/achtung the desert tigers dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Dr.
    Lessing (Lea Lander), who performs illegal experiments and torture 
   on the male and female prisoners, including castration, flogging and 
   other acts of degradation. When Lexman is made to view all this human 
   suffering by von Stolzen, he and his platoon, along with fellow 
   American prisoner Max Tyler (Mike Monty), devise a way to escape the 
   camp. After a couple of setbacks, they escape into the African desert 
   and bring Dr. Lessing along as a prisoner. Captain von Stolzen sends 
   his troops out to find them, but Lexman and his men prove to be much 
   tougher than the Captain expected. Lexman and his men lay waste to 
   several Nazi desert outposts, steal some vehicles and head back to 
   the prison camp, but Dr. Lessing breaks free and kills everyone 
   except Lexman (she runs out of bullets). In what has to be the worst 
   ending in recent memory, Lexman throws a shovel at Dr. Lessing's feet 
   and says, &quot;Dig!&quot; Cut to the closing credits.&nbsp; Directed 
   without an ounce of flair or originality by Luigi Batzella (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Devil's wedding">THE
    DEVIL'S WEDDING NIGHT</A></B> - 1973) using his &quot;Ivan 
   Kathansky&quot; pseudonym, this film is nothing more than a mixture 
   of badly-staged war action (with plenty of stock footage from other 
   films) and Nazi war camp atrocities. You will witness a man having 
   his penis lopped-off with a machete, women beaten and stripped naked 
   (with one woman forced to walk on her hands and knees while being 
   whipped with a riding crop), Max being forced to drink another man's 
   urine (he throws it in von Stolzen's face and is shot in the head) 
   and, of course, a Nazi orgy featuring naked female prisoners being 
   forced to have sex. The script (also by Batzella) tries to justify 
   all this depravity and degradation by making Captain von Stolzen a 
   homosexual (he can be seen kissing a transvestite at the orgy) and 
   Dr. Lessing a S&amp;M loving lesbian (who likes to be whipped by her 
   female assistant). Thankfully, at the 45 minute mark, the film 
   reverts back to a straight war film, but it is so damn boring and 
   uneventful, you'll be staring at the clock just begging for it to 
   end. While there is plenty of full frontal female and male nudity on 
   display during the first 45 minutes, none of it is the least bit 
   titilating, which makes me wonder what kind of people enjoy this type 
   of &quot;entertainment&quot;. This is just disturbing. Also starring 
   Isarco Ravaioli, Agnese Kalpagos, John Brown, Zaira Zoccheddu and 
   Mauro Mannatrizio. The print I viewed was a DVD-R rip of a 
   letterboxed VHS Dutch-subtitled print on the Sunrise Video Tapes

    sadistic early-70&#146;s relic tells the story of Dr. Christopher 
   Leader (Jack Buddliner) who, while browsing through an antique store 
   with his fiancee Cynthia (Jennifer Brooks), comes across the diary of 
   Dr. Jekyll. He returns to the store after hours and demands to buy 
   the book. When the shopkeeper refuses to sell it, the doctor 
   strangles him. He brings the book home and begins reading it.

   turning into<A HREF="adult_version_of_jekyll_and_hide_1972b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/adult version of jekyll and hyde-suckers ad mat.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="336" HEIGHT="245" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   his alter ego. Mr. Hyde picks up a prostitute, whips her bloody, ties 
   her to a bed, rapes her and, in a finishing touch, shoves a red-hot 
   poker up her vagina! Dr. Leader tries to duplicate the formula, but 
   has much different results than his predecessor. Instead of turning 
   into a Mr. Hyde, Dr. Leader transforms into a horny Miss Hyde (Jane 
   Tsentas). Initially shocked at the results, Dr. Leader learns to make 
   the best of the situation (since now the horny doctor can have the 
   best of both sexual worlds). Dr. Leader reads more of the diary and 
   in flashbacks we see Mr. Hyde brutally bludgeon and rape another 
   prostitute. Dr. Leader decides that Dr. Jekyll&#146;s problems with 
   his murderous double will not happen to him. That is not to be the 
   case. The police find the dead shopkeeper and clues lead them to Dr. 
   Leader. To avoid the cops, Dr. Leader hides in the body of Miss Hyde. 
   Dr. Leader&#146;s alter ego seduces his nurse (Rene Bond), whom he 
   has boned many times before as a man. Since the police are staking 
   out his residence, Dr. Leader can only leave his home as Miss Hyde. 
   She goes to a bar, picks up a sailor and castrates him with a 
   straight-razor, holding his dismembered dick in her hand while she 
   watches him bleed to death. Miss Hyde then tries to seduce Detective 
   Russo (Harry Schwartz), but she fails in her attempt at killing him. 
   Poor Cynthia is next. Promising to tell Cynthia the whereabouts of 
   her missing fiancee, Cynthia agrees to meet Miss Hyde at her 
   apartment. Miss Hyde strangles Cynthia, forcing her to pass out. Miss 
   Hyde is about to rape her when Detective Russo intervenes. Miss Hyde 
   gets tossed out a window and dies, as we view the twisted body of Dr. 
   Leader lying on the pavement below. This poverty row flick (released 
   by David F. Friedman) is heavy on the sleaze and nudity (full male 
   and female nudity with simulated sex) but it is so badly acted and 
   photographed (by screenwriter Robert Birch) that it is almost not 
   worth your time. Almost. The sex scenes are dubbed with so many 
   &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;aahs&quot; that they become 
   unintentionally hilarious instead of titillating. The phony English 
   accents in the flashback sequences are also funny. Mr. Hyde sounds 
   like Blackbeard the Pirate. The violence is brutal, but never 
   believable. Director Lee Raymond&#146;s (using the pseudonyn &quot;L. 
   Ray Monde&quot;) pedestrian approach to filmmaking destroys any 
   tension that may be had from the violent sequences. Producer Byron

   This film came late in the Italian jungle genre and, taking into 
   consideration on who directed it, I wasn't expecting much. It turns 
   out I was correct because, even if you were expecting to be 
   entertained for all the wrong reasons, this film is a dog. A little 
   tiny dog with dried shit caked on its ass. This film also claims that 
   it was based on a true story but, unless you think Tarzan is a real 
   person, I highly doubt it. All this is is a gender reversal of <B><A HREF="#Sacrifice!1972">SACRIFICE!</A></B> 
   (1972), without any of the redeeming qualities.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">The
    film opens with Catherine Miles Armstrong (Elvire Audray; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Scorpion2Tails1982">SCORPION
    WITH TWO TAILS</A></B> - 1982) telling her story to a British 
   journalist. The film then flashes back to a South American country, 
   where Catherine is on trial for two murders. To make things even more 
   confusing, the film has a flashback within a flashback, as Catherine 
   defends her life and tells the court the circumstances that brought 
   her here.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    On her 18th birthday, Catherine and her parents take a trip down the 
   Amazon River on her rich Daddy's (Rik Battaglia; <B><A HREF="conqueror_of_the_orient_1960.htm">CONQUEROR
    OF THE ORIENT</A></B> - 1960) yacht. Following them are her mother's 
   (Grace Williams) sister (Alma Vernon) and husband (Andrew Louis 
   Coppola), who are both on Daddy's payroll. They take a short break 
   and pull over to the bank of the river, where Mommy is shot in the 
   eye with a curare-tipped dart (she is also shot in the breast with an 
   arrow) and Daddy is shot in the neck, both of them dead with their <A HREF="amazonia_the_catherine_miles_story_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/amazonia the catherine miles story dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>heads
    cut off. Catherine is shot in the arm with a dart, but she survives, 
   passing out from the deadly poison. When she wakes up, she finds she 
   has been taken prisoner by a tribe of headhunters, tribe member 
   Umukai (Will Gonzales) holding Mommy's decapitated head by her hair. 
   What happens next is old hat when it comes to Italian jungle/cannibal films.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After watching real-life animal slaughter footage, where a leopard 
   rips apart a baby doe, we watch as Catherine learns the customs and 
   rituals of the native tribe. Umukai takes a shine to her, cutting the 
   head off a rival tribe member who tries to kidnap her. Catherine's 
   Aunt and Uncle form a search party to look for her. Catherine is led 
   naked through the natives' village, where tribe members offer the 
   Chief animals in order to own Catherine as their slave. Umukai makes 
   the best offer and we watch as he rapes Catherine (she likes it and 
   they become lovers!). One day, Catherine escapes the village, running 
   through the jungle topless (she watches in horror as a leopard kills 
   and eats a monkey), but she has no idea where she is going and the 
   tribe recaptures her. She is punished by the Chief, who inserts a 
   wooden dildo into her, holding the bloody dildo in the air for 
   everyone to see.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    All of this is punctuated by Catherine's narration, as she explains 
   her plight to the court and the prosecution tries to get the jury to 
   look at her as a murderess (but who did she kill?). Her jungle 
   adventure is also interrupted by footage of the search party. Since 
   we already know the answer to the question: Will she escape from the 
   tribe the tribe? and we already are almost certain of whether she 
   will be found not guilty (The London footage in the beginning of the 
   film almost answers that question), all this film has to offer is 
   stock jungle footage, scenes of topless native women and &quot;seen 
   this done much better&quot; footage of Catherine's trials and 
   trevails. It tries to be different in the finale when it is revealed 
   that Catherine's Aunt and Uncle killed her parents (to inherit their 
   fortune) and hired the tribe to kidnap her (Umukai also understands, 
   and reveals to her that talks, English!). The closing scenes show 
   Catherine surprising her Aunt and Uncle in bed in a hotel room, where 
   she paralyzes them with curare-dipped darts and then cuts their heads 
   off with a hatchet. Now you know why she was on trial for murder. It 
   turns out she was found not guilty by reason of insanity and spent 8 
   years in a mental asylum. We then see Catherine sitting on a bench in 
   a London park and crying over Umukai, who committed suicide when she 
   left the tribe!!!!</FONT></FONT><BR>

   black comedy about Hazel Aiken (Carroll Baker), who runs a murder-for-hire/electrolysis
    shop in her home. Hazel prefers to use women as her hitmen, but is 
   forced to hire L.T. (Perry King) when no woman will take a job 
   involving killing an autistic boy. L.T. is forced to live with Hazel 
   when the job is delayed and he interacts and fucks around with the 
   other inhabitants of the Aiken household: Hazel's daughter, 
   mentally-slow Mary (Susan Tyrrell), and her illegitimate black baby; 
   Hazel's mother (Mary Boylan), who never stops smoking or hacking; and 
   Hazel's husband (Gordon Oas-Heim), who is oblivious to everything 
   that's going on and who's main job seems to be putting flyers for 
   Hazel's business on parked cars. We then meet some of the hitwomen 
   and the murders they commit. One woman crushes an &quot;illegal 
   alien's&quot; legs under an auto hydrolic lift, cuts off his finger 
   (for her personal collection) and then takes a Polaroid of the body 
   as proof for the client (who wanted retribution because the illegal

    A sister hit team, Glenda (Geraldine Smith) and Marsha (Maria 
   Smith), is hired by an angry gassy woman to kill an ex-cop's 
   (Lawrence Tierney) dog, because he made fun of her shorts when they 
   were in a bar!&nbsp; Glenda and Marsha then take Mary to the movies, 
   where Marsha (who's a pyromaniac) sets fire to the theater, killing 
   fourteen of the patrons (She laughs about it when watching a news 
   report on TV the next day). The sisters steal a car (which Marsha 
   also sets fire to while Glenda is still driving it!) and leave Mary 
   on the street, where she is raped by a black thug. The next night, 
   Glenda and Marsha beat-up the ex-cop and stab his dog. After a 
   particularly nasty episode involving a baby and a highrise window, 
   L.T. gets the phonecall that the mom is ready to have her autistic 
   son killed, but Mary overhears the conversation and tries to warn the 
   boy's father, but he brushes her off (turns out that the guy she 
   talked to wasn't the father but a visiting plumber!). L.T. enters the 
   boy's bedroom, takes a look at the boy (and throws him across the 
   room) and finds himself unable to kill him (He picks up the boy, goes 
   to the parent's bedroom and says to the mother, &quot;You do 
   it!&quot;). Things fall apart for Hazel when her disappointed clients 
   start giving her a hard time (the ex-cop's dog lived, the autistic 
   boy's mother is pissed and a crooked cop pays a visit) resulting in 
   Hazel being drowned in her own kitchen sink. A most fitting end for a 
   woman so vain about appearances.&nbsp; While this film is basically 
   nothing but a series of outrageous set pieces, it's not without it's 
   twisted charms. Not one person in this flick acts normal or has any 
   morals at all, whether it's Hazel trying to stiff the blind newstand 
   guy by telling him the one dollar bill she handed him was actually a 
   five dollar bill, L.T.'s constant lies (I doubt anything he says to 
   anyone in this film is the truth) or the crooked black cop, Detective 
   Hughes (Charles McGregor), who blackmails Hazel into giving up some 
   names of her clients so he can pad his arrest record. Most of the 
   actors in this speak with thick New York City accents (filmed on 
   location) and some of the dialogue they speak is hilarious. Glenda 
   says in the theater: &quot;I only do blacks. Let's take one home. 
   Daddy said he'd chop my head off if he saw me with a nigger!&quot; 
   You know this film is special when Susan Tyrrell (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Night Warning">NIGHT
    WARNING</A></B> - 1981) is the most laid-back person in the cast. 
   She plays the role of Mary as a woman-child, who just happens to have 
   a child (she drops it on it's head on several occasions), but Hazel 
   takes her welfare checks and uses them for herself. You actually feel 
   sorry for her as the film progresses. Carroll Baker is downright 
   nasty as Hazel. She has no sympathy for anyone (even her daughter) 
   and is such a money-hungry bitch, she even has a lock on the phone so 
   no one else uses her &quot;messaging units&quot;. The film's standout 
   (and gross-out) scene comes when a distraught mother tosses her 
   crying baby out a highrise window and we watch it fall until it 
   splatters against the sidewalk, splashing blood all over a passing 
   woman. A mother then tells her young son as they are staring at the 
   dead baby, &quot;That's what I'm going to do to you if you don't shut 
   up!&quot; Cruel, shocking and hilarious. Much like <B><A HREF="andy_warhols_frankenstein_1973.htm">ANDY

   &quot;peplum&quot; films (or &quot;Sword &amp; Sandal&quot; as they 
   were also called) began to fall out of favor after fifteen years of 
   popularity, Executive Producer Roger Corman decided to update the 
   genre to fit into the swinging 70's, adding generous female nudity, 
   gory violence and, above all, role reversals, where the female 
   characters were the ones empowered and the male characters were 
   either window dressing or ineffectual villains. This Italy-lensed New 
   World Pictures production is one of the better examples of that 
   genre, thanks to the talent both in front and behind the cameras. The 
   film opens with an army of Centurians raiding various villages, 
   killing the men and taking the women to be sold into slavery. The 
   women, which includes Bodicia (Margaret Markov; <B><A HREF="#HotBox1972">THE

    to the town of Brundisium, where they are bought at a slave auction 
   (for forty pieces of gold) by the obviously gay Priscium (Sid 
   Lawrence), who brings the girls to a gladiator training camp, where 
   they will be used as slaves and whores. Their brutal trainer, 
   Cornelia (Rosalba Neri; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LadyFrankenstein">LADY
    FRANKENSTEIN</A></B> - 1971; here using the name &quot;Sara 
   Bay&quot;), abuses the women worse than the men do; putting them in 
   huge bird cages as trophies for the gladiators and their masters to 
   ogle and Bodicia is gang-raped when she slaps the face of master 
   Timarchus (Daniel Vargas). Bodicia is assigned to be the lover of 
   champion gladiator Marcus (Vic Karis) and they actually fall in love, 
   as does Mamawi and her assigned gladiator, Quintus (Jho Jhenkins), 
   who happens to be a member of her own tribe. When Bodicia and Mamawi 
   are forced to watch their lovers being slaughtered in the arena by 
   hulking gladiator Septimus (Peter Cester), they get into a fight with 
   the other female slaves when one of them offhandedly remarks that 
   Quintus was &quot;only a black&quot;. After watching the women fight, 
   Timarchus gets the bright idea of training the women to become female 
   gladiators and pit them against each other in arena matches. It turns 
   out to be a giant hit with the spectators when Bodicia defeats a 
   drunk Deidre in the arena without killing her, but the spectators 
   eventually grow tired of the shenanigans and demand blood, forcing 
   Mimawi to kill Lucinda (Mary Count), Septimus' lover and mother of 
   his child, in the arena. The next arena match is to be between 
   Bodicia and Mimawi, but Bodicia talks a changed Septimus into helping 
   the women escape. When Septimus decides to kill Timarchus on his own 
   and fails (losing his life in the process). Bodicia and Mimawi are 
   forced to fight to the death in the arena, but they have a plan that 
   ends with Timarchus in the arena begging for his life. This leads to 
   a revolt, where the women are aided by the gladiators, much to the 
   fickle spectators' glee, and escape in the catacombs beneath the 
   city. Who will survive?&nbsp; This compact little exploitationer,

    is to kill the women he tries to sleep with and stash them in a 
   pigeon hutch on his roof. Eddie's not a bad guy. He gives his male 
   students pointers on how to treat the ladies (&quot;Be patient. Give 
   them room, but not too much.&quot;) and walks around like he doesn't 
   have a care in the world. He's good looking and the women love him. 
   He hires a prostitute (Roberta Collins of <B><A HREF="caged_heat_1974.htm">CAGED

   able to achieve sexual gratification. When the roommate (Cherie 
   Latimer) of the first killed girl reports her missing, the police 
   come to her apartment, find grass in the bathroom and arrest her! 
   (This is the 70's after all.) Eddie gets picked up at the beach by a 
   beautiful girl and they take a shower together. Again, unable to 
   perform sexually, Eddie stabs the girl repeatedly (and may have 
   performed necrophelia with her corpse) while calling her a 
   &quot;slut&quot; and cleans up her body in a tub. When Eddie can no 
   longer use his prostitute to play his mother (She tries to kiss him 
   without dressing up as his mother and he spits on her and calls her a 
   &quot;whore&quot;.), he begins to unravel. When neighbors of Eddie's 
   apartment complex begin to complain of a bad smell coming from the 
   ceiling, the landlady (Isabel Jewell) tells the neighbors not to 
   worry (she secretly chained-up the pigeon hutch to kill the birds and 
   thinks the smell is the birds decomposing). Eddie goes on a muderous 
   rampage, killing the roomate of his first victim and his wanna-be 
   girlfriend Barbara (Nadyne Turney). The last time we see Eddie, he is 
   sitting in the pigeon hutch, staring blankly. This is the first film 
   of director Curtis Hanson, who would go on to much acclaim for his 
   multi-award winning <B><A HREF="la_confidential_1997.htm">L.A. CONFIDENTIAL</A></B>

   he does get a sympathetic performance out of Tab Hunter, who sheds 
   his good-guy image that he had for many years before and opened his 
   career up to play more diverse roles, but unfortunately, mainly in 
   low-budget garbage. Originally shot in 1971 under the title <B><A HREF="sweet_kill_1970.htm">SWEET

   This is a brutal Hong Kong exploitation film that takes place at a 
   sadistic women's concentration camp run by the Japanese during World 
   War II. The film opens with a squad of Japanese soldiers invading a 
   Red Cross mobile hospital unit looking for a downed American pilot. 
   After callously shooting some Chinese locals and the American pilot, 
   the soldiers grab the nurses, including Jennifer (Birte Tove, a 
   Danish actress who starred in several 70's Hong Kong films), Mary 
   (Roska Rozen) and Elizabeth (Niki Wane), and send them to the 
   notorious 13 Womens Camp, where they are tortured, raped (by both the 
   male and female guards) and treated like human waste. After being put 
   through a litany of abuses, usually at the behest of head lesbian 
   guard Mako (Terry Liu), the nurses join forces with Hung Yulan (Li 
   Hai-shu), a fellow prisoner who is an undercover operative in the 
   Chinese opposition forces and has clues to where a fortune in stolen 
   gold is hidden that could help the opposition defeat the Japanese. 
   One of the male guards at the camp is actually an undercover <A HREF="bamboo_house_of_dolls_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bamboo house of dolls dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="189" HEIGHT="268" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>operative
    and he helps the women escape, but their freedom is short-lived when 
   it is revealed that one of the women prisoners is a traitor (her 
   identity is not revealed yet), they are all recaptured and the 
   undercover guard is shot and killed. When Mako and her male superiors 
   find out about the hidden gold, they torture Hung Yulan with electric 
   shocks to get her to give up the location. Mako and her superiors are 
   not able to extract the information from her, so they decide to let 
   Hung Yulan and her new friends escape and follow them to the hidden 
   gold (Mary is killed in the escape, but her dying words are, &quot;I'm
    not the traitor!&quot;). As the group gets closer to the gold, the 
   traitor leaves a marked trail for Mako and a squad of Japanese 
   soldiers to follow. When the traitor kills blind female prisoner 
   Huang Hsai (Lo Hsai-ying) for discovering her identity, she is 
   finally outed and a trap is laid for Mako and the other Japs by the 
   opposition forces. In true Hong Kong fashion, not even the good girls 
   (and guys) survive in the extremely bloody finale.&nbsp; The first 
   thing you'll notice about this Shaw Brothers production, directed by 
   Kuei Chi Hung (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#KillerSnakes">THE KILLER SNAKES</A></B>

    BOXER'S OMEN</A></B> - 1983), is how sexually graphic it is for a 
   1973 Hong Kong film. Hardly a minute goes by without a shot of naked 
   female breasts and there are also several instances of full-frontal 
   nudity, as well as leering close-ups of panty crotch shots. It's 
   obvious that this film was made as a cash-in to the sudden popularity 
   of the drive-in WIP films like <B><A HREF="#BigDollHouse">THE BIG 
   DOLL HOUSE</A></B> (1971) and <B><A HREF="#BigBirdCage1972">THE BIG 
   BIRD CAGE</A></B> (1972), but <B>BAMBOO HOUSE OF DOLLS</B> takes the 
   genre a step further, adding an air of historical reference (the 
   Japanese mistreatment and illegal experimentation of prisoners during 
   the war) and an extremely nasty tone not seen in films of this type 
   at the time. Not only is rape prevalent, violence also runs rampant, 
   as women are shot, stabbed, bludgeoned, electrocuted and, in one 
   instance, Mako forces the prisoners to take turns whipping one of 
   their own until she is dead. This being a Hong Kong production, all 
   the Japanese are portrayed as heartless, raping bastards and bitches 
   that laugh at the sight of human suffering. There's plenty of good 
   action set-pieces on view, especially during the final third, 
   including a pretty decent car jump gag, lots of bloody sword and 
   gunplay and a smattering of martial arts action. Mix that with plenty 
   of girl-on-girl action, Mako's delirious death by rolling off the 
   side of a mountain in a metal barrel (it really must be seen to be 
   appreciated), hordes of snakes (a Hong Kong staple) and a typical 
   downbeat finale and what you end up with may not be the feel-good 
   movie of the year but, boy, it's an entertaining one. Also starring 
   action star Lo Lieh (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackMagic1975">BLACK
    MAGIC</A></B> - 1975) as the rebel guard who assists the women in

   film concludes) and Wang Hsia (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#OilyManiac">OILY

   His death is memorable. This did receive a U.S. theatrical release in

   panties next to it), snaring his leg in a bear trap and then hacking 
   him to death with a specially-made machete. The second clan member, 
   Ko (Kwong Tso-Fai), is dropped head-first into a wooden box full of 
   protruding nails, ripping his head to shreds as he tries to remove 
   it. When he tries to get the last three clan members in one fell 
   swoop, the father fails and has to escape (by jumping off a 
   waterfalls) after being seriously wounded. The clan members think he 
   is dead, but we know better, don't we? As the remaining clan members 
   gloat in their perceived victory, the father returns to finish his 
   revenge and we finally learn just what exactly is being kept in those 
   covered cages. They like raw meat and growl like a dog. Shit! They're 
   just dogs!&nbsp; Half the fun of watching this disturbing little 
   thriller, directed by Dennis Yu (<B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Imp1981">THE IMP</A></B>

   can hear on the soundtrack. I'm sure I missed a few, but I heard one 
   from The Police (&quot;Don't Stand So Close To Me&quot;), Genesis 
   (&quot;Stay With Me&quot;) and a terrible Hong Kong remake of 
   Supertramp's &quot;Dreamer&quot;. Also, be aware that the version of 
   the film I viewed was a composite print and contains hardcore footage 
   during the rape scene (including vaginal penetration by fingers and a <A HREF="beasts_1980.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/beasts aka flesh and bloody terror vcd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="232" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>shot
    of an erect penis), but seems to be missing some frames of gory 
   violence. This is a film very much in the vein of <B><A HREF="last_house_on_the_left2.htm">LAST
    HOUSE ON THE LEFT</A></B> (1972) and <B><A HREF="i_spit_on_your_grave.htm">I
    SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE</A></B> (1978) but, unfortunately, the 
   badly-translated burned-in English subtitles look to have been 
   translated by someone who uses English as a third language, leaving a 
   lot to be desired and actually destroying some of the tension in the 
   latter half of the film. As with <B>SPIT</B>, one of the rapist clan, 
   Mo (Kent Cheng of <B><A HREF="action.htm#Run &amp; Kill">RUN AND KILL</A></B> 
   [1993]), is mentally retarded. He still comes off as the most 
   sympathetic character here, as he's continually abused by the rest of 
   the clan, refuses to take part in Ling's rape and has a pet mokkey 
   named Kiki, who is his only real friend. His constant cries of 
   &quot;Not my business!&quot; to Ling's father is the only thing that 
   rings true in a film that's full of unbelievable situations. I was 
   also bitterly disappointed to find out that it was only dogs being 
   kept in those covered cages, especially with the buildup they were 
   giving it. I was expecting maybe an even more feral, cannibalistic 
   clan member, but finding out that they were only hungry German 
   Shepherds was the film's biggest letdown. The best scene comes when 
   Ling's father is being chased by the hungry dogs and he gets them off 
   his scent by feeding them pieces of Fu's body, who is buried nearby. 
   The finale also shows that there are more mountain clans to replace 
   the dead ones, as a trio of new degenerates watch and salivate over a 
   new bunch of campers they see arriving in the forest. As with most 
   Hong Kong genre films of the 70's &amp; 80's, snakes are in abundant 
   supply. They are chopped-up, thrown around, generally abused and used 
   creatively in one death scene. I was never a big fan of rape/revenge 
   films, but this one (also known as <B>FLESH AND BLOODY TERROR</B>) is 
   just offbeat enough to merit at least one viewing. Also starring Wong 
   Chin, Paul Chung, Wong Siu-Ling and Kwok Man-Po as the 
   dentally-challenged clan member named Snake. Never legally available 
   on U.S. home video (I'm sure music rights play a role in that), but 
   you can find this for purchase at many grey market sites. <B>Not Rated</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

   forest and taking them to his tastefully decorated cave. Bigfoot then

   rifles kidnap the group and demand to know the whereabouts of a cache

   This sexploitation film has plenty of unanswered questions such as,

   offbeat it is sure to keep you occupied. Gratuitous nudity and sex, 
   70's fashions (including hip-high go go boots), campy dialogue and a

   70's drive-in flick, courtesy of producer Roger Corman and his New 
   World Pictures. 1932 rural Texas: Wilma McClatchie (Angie Dickinson) 
   is tired of living the poor life with her two daughters, sexually 
   promiscuous Billy Jean (Susan Sennett; <B><A HREF="candy_snatchers_1973.htm">THE
    CANDY SNATCHERS</A></B> - 1973) and dumb-as-a-fencepost Polly 
   (Robbie Lee; <B><A HREF="switchblade_sisters_1975.htm">SWITCHBLADE SISTERS</A></B> 
   - 1975). When their Uncle Barney (Noble Willingham) is shot dead by 
   G-Man Bonney (Dick Miller), Wilma and the girls take over his illegal 
   whiskey business, but learn after a short while that this is not a 
   business that women should be involved with, so they head out to 
   California for a &quot;better life&quot;. The rest of the film 
   details their exploits while they are on their way to California. 
   Billy Jean and Polly decide to earn extra money by stripping at a 
   smoker, which upsets Wilma to no end. She enters the smoker with 
   pistols drawn and robs the place, which makes Wilma and the girls 
   Public Enemy #1 with Bonney, who is always one step behind them. When 
   their car breaks down, Wilma and the girls steal a car and money 
   belonging to a crooked preacher and then head for the next town, 
   where Wilma tries to cash a bad check at a bank. Enter bank robber 
   Fred Diller (Tom Skerritt), who decides to pull a stickup at the bank 
   at the same time. Diller's partner is shot and killed, so Wilma and 
   the girls pick up the slack and help Diller rob the bank. Wilma and 
   Diller soon become lovers, which upsets Billy Jean because she had 
   her eyes on him. <A HREF="big_bad_mama_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/big bad mama poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="185" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>While
    at the horse races, Wilma meets con man William J. Baxter (William 
   Shatner) and he becomes the newest member of Wilma's gang. Baxter 
   becomes Wilma's newest lover, which now opens the door for Diller and 
   Billy Jean to get it on (Billy Jean even shares him with Polly and 
   Wilma doesn't seem to mind!). Polly becomes pregnant (she carries a 
   rag doll with her throughout most of the film as a symbol of her 
   child-like demeanor) and is wounded when the quintet rob an oil well. 
   The screwed-up family dynamic of the group is put to the test when 
   Wilma demands that Diller marry Polly and he tells Wilma that her 
   really loves her. The gang then crash a party attended by rich, 
   influential snobs. After robbing then, the gang kidnaps snotty 
   debutante Jane Kingston (Joan Prather) and hold her for a one million 
   dollar ransom. Baxter proves how thin his skin is when he leaves the 
   gang in fear, only to be captured by Bonney. He squeals like a pig 
   and gives up the time and location of the ransom drop, which leads to 
   a final big shoot-out between Wilma's gang and Bonney's police force. 
   Diller is killed in an act of self-sacrifice, but Wilma is also 
   killed in the getaway, leaving Billy Jean and a pregnant Polly to 
   survive on their own.&nbsp; This exploitation staple is what drive-in 
   movies were all about: Plenty of nudity, a smattering of violence, 
   car chases and lots of gunfights. Director Steve Carver (<B><A HREF="#Arena1973">THE
    ARENA</A></B> - 1973; <B><A HREF="capone_1975.htm">CAPONE</A></B> -

   - 1983) knows exactly what audiences craved, sparing no excuse to get 
   the women (including Angie Dickinson) naked as much as possible. It's 
   apparent that Angie Dickinson is not using a body double here (like 
   she did in the vastly inferior sequel <B><A HREF="big_bad_mama_2_1987.htm">BIG
    BAD MAMA II</A></B> [1987]), although I could have done without the 
   sight of a naked William Shatner (who hams it up shamelessly here). 
   The violence is never too bloody, most of it being bloody bullet 
   squibs or gun violence. The screenplay, by genre vet William Norton (<B><A HREF="i_dismember_mama_1974b.htm">I
    DISMEMBER MAMA</A></B> - 1972; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DayOfAnimals1976">DAY
    OF THE ANIMALS</A></B> - 1976) and Frances Doel, is mostly concerned 
   with the twisted morality of Wilma, who has no trouble using her body 
   (or her daughters' bodies) to get her way. Case in point: Even though 
   Diller got her retarded daughter Polly pregnant, Wilma is again 
   sleeping with him at the end of the film. Though Wilma apparently 
   dies for her various sins at the end of the film, Roger Corman (who 
   was known to milk a good concept until it spits out dust) couldn't 
   resist reviving her in the ill-advised sequel thirteen years later. 
   Look closely and you'll spot a very young Sally Kirkland (topless, of 
   course) in the beginning and Paul Bartel (also this film's Second 
   Unit Director) as a party guest at the debutante ball. The music 
   soundtrack, which is banjo-heavy bluegrass, contains the nimble 
   pickings of Greatful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia. This is also the 
   first film credit for actor Bill Paxton, who was a Set Dresser here. 
   When I think of good 70's exploitation, <B><A HREF="big_bad_mama_1974b.htm">BIG
    BAD MAMA</A></B> immediately comes to mind. Corman, who directed <B><A HREF="bloody_mama_1970.htm">BLOODY

   (1980). Unfortunately, most of her nude scenes in <B>DRESSED</B> were

   retired from genre filmmaking. Why he didn't direct more films is a 
   story that could fill a book, but at least most of his films are 
   available in some format on home video for us to enjoy over and over 
   again. The Philippines-lensed <B>THE BIG BIRD CAGE</B> opens with 
   singer Blossom (Pam Grier) and her guitarist boyfriend Django (Sid

   off a bridge to avoid capture (Blossom escapes in a separate vehicle) 
   and the police arrest Terry as an &quot;accomplice&quot;. Since Terry 
   is an embarrassment to the government, she is sent to a remote 
   government work camp located deep in the jungle, where Warden Zappa 
   (Andy Centenera, who kicks a puppy just for the hell of it!) warns 
   Terry and the other new prisoners that there will be &quot;no 
   fornication, with anyone, of any kind, ever!&quot; The Warden also 
   shows them that escape is impossible by giving them all a taste of 
   his bloodthirsty guard dogs. Meanwhile, Django make the long trek on 
   foot back to his jungle village, where perturbed girlfriend Blossom 
   is pissed at him for kidnapping Terry and threatens to cut-off his 
   balls with a machete (In a hilarious scene, he fights her off with a 
   plucked chicken, where they fall into a mud puddle and then make 
   love!). Django and Blossom are the leaders of a group of 
   &quot;revolutionaries&quot;, although none of them are sure what they 
   are revolting against. Group member Moreno (Subas Herrero) complains 
   about the lack of female members, so he wonders out loud where they 
   can find a couple of hundred women. Hmmm... Back at the work camp, 
   Terry is introduced to the other prisoners, including lesbian Bull 
   Jones (Teda Bracci; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Centerfold Girls">THE
    CENTERFOLD GIRLS</A></B> - 1974) and tall, lanky Karen (Karen 
   McKevic, in her only film role, which is a crying shame), as well as 
   watching Warden Zappa's mechanical contraption, a tall bamboo and 
   wooden gear structure that separates the sugar from the sugar cane, 
   dubbed &quot;The Big Bird Cage&quot;, as it claims the life of 
   another female prisoner when she gets her hand caught in the gears 
   and falls to her death. It also seems the only person getting any sex 
   in this prison without bars is the Warden, who, with the help of gay 
   guard Rocco (Vic Diaz; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Superbeast1972">SUPERBEAST</A></B> 
   - 1972; in a hilarious performance), grabs random prisoners and rapes 
   them. His latest victim is Lin (Rizza Fabian), whom the Warden 
   sexually abuses and then blackmails to become a prison snitch, using 
   Lin's young daughter as insurance she will spill her guts when the 
   time comes. When Blossom gets sent to the work camp after she and her 
   group perform a pretty embarrassing stab at being revolutionaries (a 
   funny scene involving a dud grenade), it leads to a series of events 
   that culminates in boyfriend Django and the other male 
   revolutionaries raiding the work camp and freeing the grateful female 
   prisoners and all the bad guys getting their just desserts. This 
   being a 70's exploitation film, though, nearly everyone ends up dead 
   by the film's end.&nbsp; Director/screenwriter Hill mixes equal parts 
   comedy with gritty violence (including Terry being strung-up by her 
   hair after an unsuccessful escape attempt), which makes <B>THE BIG 
   BIRD CAGE</B> one of the best WIP flicks to come out of the 
   &quot;anything goes&quot; 70's. Every exploitation element is touched 
   upon, including plentiful nudity by nearly every female cast member; 
   bloody violence; catfights; torture; gay stereotypes (Sid Haig 
   pretending to be a homosexual to get close to Vic Diaz is one of the 
   funniest, if not one of the most offensive slap to gay people, scenes 
   in 70's genre filmmaking); and gun battles. There's not a boring 
   moment in this film and I wish that Karen McKevic made more movies 
   after this because she not only had beauty; she also had a real 
   screen presence (What happened to her?). Vic Diaz is a scream as gay 
   guard Rocco (it's one of his best early-70's roles) and some of his 
   dialogue is simply priceless (as is his final comeuppance at the 
   hands of the horny female prisoners). <B><A HREF="big_bird_cage_1972b.htm">THE

   at a prison&nbsp; in some unnamed Middle East country, so when they

   make the nuns strip, escape disguised as Sisters of God and take a 
   real nun, Sister Maria (Monica Taylor), with them. Their freedom is 
   short-lived, though, when they are betrayed and sold to white slave 
   trader El Kadir (Gordon Mitchell). As they are about to be loaded 
   onto a ship, the ship's captain, Jeff (Tony Kendall), saves them, 
   steals a truck and drives them to safety. Their truck breaks down, so 
   Jeff leads them on a long walk through the desert, where they happen 
   upon an oasis, swim nude in a lake and then are attacked and raped by 
   some Arab nomads. After having their way with the women (after

    El Kadir has sent out a hunting party to retrieve his

   inhabited by black burka-wearing women, so they send Sister Maria in 
   to look for Nadia. She finds Nadia nude, tied-up and being whipped by 
   a mute retarded Arab man, but before she can save Nadia, Sister Maria 
   almost gets stoned to death by the burka-wearing women. Jeff and the 
   girls save the day and, after they kill some Arab marauders, they 
   steal some horses and ride away. They run into some 
   &quot;policemen&quot; and kill them when they try to rape the women 
   and Jeff takes them to a castle in the mountains, only to find El 
   Kadir and his men waiting for them. Jeff is thrown into the dungeon 
   and the girls (including Sister Maria) are forced to participate as 
   playthings in one of El Kadir's drunken orgies. Jeff is set free by 
   an unlikely ally (who is after El Kadir's hidden loot) and he goes 
   about trying to free the women. Unfortunately, during the ongoing gun 
   battle, all but two women (and Jeff) make it out alive. Sister Maria 
   sacrifices her own life to save Jeff and the two women, who ride off 
   to safety in the film's conclusion.&nbsp; This badly-dubbed

    EXPERIMENT LOVE CAMP</A></B> - 1976) don't really offer much to the 
   viewer besides frequent female nudity and sex (some of which was 
   edited out to achieve an R rating) and mostly bloodless violence. I 
   do give the film some points for the location shooting (the mountain 
   castle is impressive), but there's not much characterization, as all 
   the women (besides Sister Maria) are interchangable and lack distinct 
   personalities. Top-billed Vonetta McGee is wasted in a thankless role 
   (I believe she has the fewest lines of all the women in the film) and 
   was probably given the top spot to lure blaxploitation fans to this 
   since McGee starred in three blaxploitation films in 1972: <B><A HREF="hammer_1972.htm">HAMMER</A></B>,

    Fans of those films must have felt cheated for being falsely-lured

   prison escapees would have absolutely no interesting female 
   characters. The most interesting role goes to genre vet Tony Kendall (<B><A HREF="return_of_the_blind_dead_1973.htm">RETURN

   film, along with <B><A HREF="#BigBirdCage1972">THE BIG BIRD CAGE</A></B> 
   (1972; both directed by Jack Hill), has the distinction of 
   kick-starting the 70's WIP (women in prison) craze. Tough-as-nails 
   Marnie Collier (Judy Brown) is sent to a &quot;Banana Republic&quot; 
   prison (actually lensed in the Philippines) for 99 years on a false 
   murder conviction. After being thoroughly searched in every orifice, 
   she is thrown in a dingy cell with Alcott (Roberta Collins), Harrad 
   (Brooke Mills), Bodine (Pat Woodell) and lesbian Grear (Pam Grier), 
   who takes an instant shine to Collier. The prison's female warden, 
   Miss Dietrich (Christiane Schmidtmer), is a Bible-quoting she-bitch 
   who's not above murder to keep her prisoners in line. Bodine plans on 
   escaping after she gets a smuggled-in letter from her revolutionary 
   boyfriend telling her that he needs her badly, but someone snitches 
   to Miss Dietrich about the letter and she has Bodine tortured, first 
   by suspending her in a small bamboo cage in the blazing sun and then 
   bringing her to a dungeon, where she is waterboarded and whipped by 
   brutal head guard Lucian (Kathryn Loder) while some unknown person 
   watches in the shadows. Bodine is brought back to her cell bloody and 
   bruised, now even more determined to escape <A HREF="big_doll_house_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/big doll house dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="167" HEIGHT="250" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>and
    join her boyfriend. Two black marketeers, Harry (Sid Haig) and his 
   new partner Fred (Jerry Franks), make weekly trips to the prison and 
   supply the women prisoners with a wide range of goods, including 
   drugs, cigarettes and smuggled information, but it all comes with a 
   price, mainly sex. When Miss Dietrich catches Alcott having sex with 
   the inexperienced Fred, she becomes the next torture victim in the 
   dungeon. Alcott is shocked with electricity by Lucian (she attaches 
   electrodes to Alcott's nipples and vagina) while the same unknown 
   person watches in the shadows. The girls put their differences aside 
   and plan an escape, using a cat and the unwitting duo of Harry and 
   Fred in their attempt. It almost comes undone when junkie Harrad 
   stabs Grear in the neck in a fit of jealous rage, killing her. 
   Collier is then tortured with a cobra by Lucian in the dungeon, but 
   Alcott, Bodine and Ferrina (Gina Stuart) rescue her, overpower Lucian 
   and discover the identity of the person hiding in the shadows (it's 
   Miss Dietrich, who gets her sexual jollies by watching prisoners 
   tortured and killed!). The girls then break out of prison, but not 
   everyone will escape with their lives. During the fatalistic, yet 
   strangely satisfying, conclusion, all the women are either killed or 
   recaptured, but not before Miss Dietrich receives her just 
   rewards.&nbsp; This thoroughly sadistic, yet highly watchable, 
   exploitationer delivers the goods, thanks to the cast of beautiful 
   female genre vets and the&nbsp; expert direction of Jack Hill, who 
   also gave us such low-budget classics like <B><A HREF="spider_baby_1964.htm">SPIDER

   (1975). Hill only directed a handful of films in his career, yet he 
   always seemed to know what audiences wanted: Namely, copious amounts 
   of nudity and plenty of violence. <B><A HREF="big_doll_house_1971c.htm">THE
    BIG DOLL HOUSE</A></B> doesn't disappoint, as every female in the 
   cast has at least one nude scene (including a boner-inducing fight 
   between Roberta Collins and Pam Grier in a mud pit) and loads of 
   mind-boggling violence, usually by the hands of Lucian in her torture 
   dungeon. This was one of Roger Corman's earliest hits for his New 
   World Pictures production outfit (both Corman and Cirio H. Santiago 
   are uncredited producers) and it's easy to see why. Besides Jack 
   Hill's direction, the cast gives their all here, stripping-off their 
   clothes, getting into catfights and, finally, working together to 
   escape their hellhole. It's no wonder this film spawned countless 
   other WIP flicks. It's well-made, violent (some of the torture 
   devices are downright bizarre), exciting and, surprisingly, contains 
   some real human drama. One of the earliest WIP movies to take 
   advantage of the R-rating and still one of the best. Pam Grier sings 
   the opening tune, &quot;Long Time Woman&quot;. John Ashley and Eddie 
   Romero were the Executive Producers. Also starring Jack Davis and

    Eva (Laura Gemser; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#MurderObsession1981">MURDER
    OBSESSION</A></B> - 1981) is an exotic dancer in Hong Kong. She 
   meets businessman Jules Carmichael (frequent Gemser co-star Gabriele 
   Tinti; <B><A HREF="#EmanuellePrison1983">EMANUELLE IN PRISON</A></B> 
   - 1983) on a plane and they become fast friends. Jules tells his 
   brother, Judas (Jack Palance; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#WithoutWarning1979">WITHOUT
    WARNING</A></B> - 1979), that he has got to see Eva's nightclub act, 
   so they both go, where they see Eva dancing topless with a giant 
   snake wrapped around her body (it's not really much of an act or a 
   performance). Judas is instantly smitten, not because Eva is 
   beautiful (which she is), but because he is a snake lover. He has a 
   house full of snakes, most of them poisonous and deadly. We soon 
   discover that Eva is bisexual, as we watch her feel-up an oriental 
   dancer (Jenny Liang; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BloodyParrot">BLOODY
    PARROT</A></B> - 1981) under a table after she finishes her show 
   and, later that night, she masturbates in bed dreaming of them making 
   love. Judas, who considers himself a reptile expert, phones Eva and 
   invites her to lunch, but he doesn't tell her why. Eva is curious, so 
   she meets him, but she doesn't know what is in store for her. Judas 
   takes Eva to his house and he introduces her to his 
   &quot;friends&quot;: a viper (a fer-de-lance) and other deadly 
   snakes, especially his python and black cobra. Eva is scared, not of 
   the snakes, but of Judas. He tries to calm her down by saying, &quot;I
    like the scent of you!&quot;, but she leaves anyway (wouldn't you?). 
   Eva's oriental manager smacks her around, telling her he is jealous 
   of her girlfriends, so she strips naked and makes love to him 
   (setting women's rights back 50 years). Jules talks Eva into going 
   back to see his brother, where Judas gives her a very expensive 
   diamond necklace (he can afford it) and she gladly accepts (setting 
   women's rights back 100 years). Jules is a little jealous of his 
   brother's relationship with Eva (maybe more than he is showing). At a 
   party at Judas' house (where we see <A HREF="j&amp;b_scotch_whiskey_in_italian_films.htm">bottles
    of J&amp;B Scotch</A>, an Italian movie staple), Eva meets Candy 
   (Sigrid Zanger) and they play sex games with Candy's boyfriend Robert 
   and then with each other, while Jules secretly watches them. Jules 
   then introduces Eva to Gerri (Michele Starck; <B><A HREF="salon_kitty_1976.htm">SALON
    KITTY</A></B> - 1976) and then immediately leaves (What is he up 
   to?). While Gerri is putting on a skimpy bikini, Eva walks in and 
   they make love (Does she ever get tired?). Gerri and Eva then get 
   naked massages (with hand vibrators) and they get turned-on by 
   watching each other getting turned-on. At dinner, we learn that Gerri 
   studies Chinese medicine and that Judas bought Eva a new Mercedes 
   (setting women's rights back 150 years). Gerri is broke and can't 
   afford her studies, so Eva gives her money, saying &quot;I love you, 
   Gerri.&quot; (It's not her money, it's Judas', setting back women's 
   rights 200 years!). Jules and Candy make love and he puts one of 
   Judas' poisonous snakes on her naked body. Candy screams and Jules 
   laughs like a madman (If none of this seems to make sense, join the 
   club!!!). Eva takes Gerri to a lesbian nightclub, where they watch 
   two Korean girls strip while they dance to some inappropriate music 
   (it's obvious that they are dancing to music other than what is 
   playing on the soundtrack).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We are an hour into the film and I was hoping some kind of plot 
   would kick-in, but this is what you get: When Eva gets to Judas' 
   house, she finds Candy passed out on the floor and a doctor is taking 
   her to the hospital. Judas and Jules have to take a long business 
   trip, so Judas asks Eva to take care of his snakes. She agrees and, 
   once Judas and Jules are gone, Eva brings Gerri to the house (after 
   they take a long walking tour through the streets of Hong Kong, where 
   we watch a street vendor cut up a live snake and fry the pieces in a 
   wok, which Eva and Gerri happily eat!). They then make love (I hate 
   to say it, but this is getting tiring!) and take a shower together, 
   where we learn that Jules didn't go with Judas, as he is spying on 
   Eva and Gerri as they soap-up their bodies.&nbsp; Eva and Gerri then 
   take care of the snakes, feeding them live mice (we watch one <A HREF="black_cobra_1976_italy_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/black cobra woman italy poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>snake
    squeeze the life out of a poor mouse. Why do Italians feel they have 
   to put real-life animal deaths in their films?). Jules grabs the most 
   poisonous snake in the house (and Judas' favorite), a green mamba, 
   and releases it into Eva's bedroom, where she and Gerri are sleeping. 
   It bites Gerri and she dies (Eva just watches her die, not lifting a 
   finger to help her, but she grabs the snake and puts it in its 
   cage!). It turns out Jules is a sadist and doesn't like the fact that 
   his dead father turned over the business to Judas. Yep, that's the 
   entire plot!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Indifferently acted, especially by Palance, who doesn't even try to 
   give his character any emotion. It's apparent he's only in this film 
   for the paycheck (This was made during his B-Movie period). Palance 
   starred in many better Italian productions, including <B><A HREF="cop_in_blue_jeans_1976.htm">THE
    COP IN BLUE JEANS</A></B> (1976) and <B><A HREF="rulers_of_the_city_1976.htm">RULERS
    OF THE CITY</A></B> (1976). Laura Gemser is basically Laura Gemser, 
   doffing her clothes at the drop of a hat and screwing the person 
   closest to her. There is no blood or gore in this movie and, man, 
   could it have used it. Even the snakes lack the proper danger we 
   expect the slithery creatures to hold. Joe D'Amato was not only the 
   director and screenwriter, he was also the cinematographer and 
   besides some beautiful Hong Kong vistas, there's not much eye candy 
   besides Gemser. Even the &quot;surprise&quot; ending, where Eva gets 
   even with Jules for killing Gerri by having two oriental men hold him 
   down while she releases a snake that crawls up his ass, telling him 
   that it will eat its way out of his body (!), rings hollow. It's all 
   a case of too little, too late. Where is the sleaze? Where is the 
   violence? Where is the mind-numbing weirdness? Even Eva dying in the 
   finale (She plays with the green mamba in front of Judas and it bites 
   her!) fails to register with the audience. A serious loser from Joe D'Amato.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   is saved for the final 15 minutes, where Albert Salmi blows off 
   Douglas Fowley's head with a shotgun (in a surprisingly graphic 
   effects shot that begs the viewer to rewind and watch it again in 
   slow motion) and then shoots Robert F. Lyons in the back. The finale 
   , where Vint and Salmi duke it out in a quarry, contains a truly 
   memorable long shot where Salmi's police car flies over a cliff while 
   Salmi has the drop on Vint. This sequence, because of the exact

   himself to the local bar to collect the rest of the money he's owed.

   and Holt shoot at it with their rifles, killing the female driver 
   (she is shot right between the eyes) and forcing the careening bus to 
   pin Roy between two trash dumpsters, crushing him to death (a fitting 
   death for white trash). When Mino sees his dead son, he wants revenge 
   and offers $1,000 for every &quot;bitch&quot; that the hillbilly 
   locals kill. The bus continues down the backwoods roads and stop at a

   hicksploitation fun and once you realize it was directed by a woman, 
   Tanya Rosenberg (who has never done anything else), it makes it all 
   the more demented. The screenplay, by Craig Clyde, James L. Hennessy 
   and George P. Saunders, contains all the hicksploitation staples: 
   toothless drunken hillbillies who don't have an original thought in 
   their empty little heads; plenty of good-looking women who walk 
   around with little or nothing on; lots of gory deaths (Stoney is shot 
   in the back with a crossbow and pinned to a tree; another girl gets a 
   crossbow bolt to her chest; one hillbilly has his head cracked open 
   with a baseball bat; various bloody bullet squibs), many of them 
   filmed in ultra-slow-motion; and uncomfortable scenes of rape. Hey, 
   I'm not saying that this is a good film, but it contains enough 
   graphic nudity and violence to keep this viewer happily entertained 
   for 87 minutes. Now I wish that someone would tell me what happened 
   to Tanya Rosenberg (Is it possible that it is a pseudonym?) and why

    MANIA</A><A NAME="BloodMania1970"></A> (1970) -</B> Although this is 
   basically nothing but a soap opera with a sleazy feel (the ads made 
   it look like a horror film), it is still an important part of 70's 
   exploitation because it was one of only four films Peter Carpenter 
   appeared in. Carpenter (who also wrote the story the screenplay was 
   based on and co-produced) was a handsome good actor who supposedly 
   died, but no one can come up with a date or year he actually died. 
   Some say it was a heart attack, some say it was influenza, but one 
   thing is certain: no one has conclusively stated that Peter Carpenter 
   is dead at all. Here's my speculation: Since Carpenter was a star and

   ridiculous vig [a weekly/monthly amount of interest on the loan that 
   was unusually high, usually within the 50% to 80% range!], he is 
   either swimming with the fishes or changed his name and is living in 
   another country [He's still young enough to be alive]). No matter 
   what happened, there no denying Peter Carpenter had talent and would 
   have probably become a major star (he could actually sing and had no 
   problem with nudity). The story is as old as films themselves: Dr. 
   Craig Cooper (Carpenter) is a doctor who works in a clinic and makes 
   house calls to a rich patient named Ridgely Waterman (Eric Allison), 
   who has a bad heart condition, is cruel to his daughter, painter 
   Victoria (Maria De Aragon: <B><A HREF="cremators_1972.htm">THE CREMATORS</A></B> 
   - 1972), and owns the clinic Craig works at. Craig is also being 
   blackmailed by Larry Miller (Arell Blanton), who wants $50,000 from 
   Craig in two weeks or he will go to the police with photos of Craig 
   performing illegal abortions when he was younger so he could pay for 
   medical school. Craig reveals all his secrets to his live-in 
   girlfriend Cheryl (Reagan Wilson) and she wonders how in the world he 
   will get $50,000 in two weeks, so she comes up with a plan of her own 
   (behind her boyfriend's back). Craig really is a nice guy who cares 
   about his patients and won't even cheat on his girlfriend, even 
   though every time he goes to Ridgely's mansion, Victoria (who always 
   has a strange recurring nightmare; we see it in the opening of the 
   film, but it is made to look like Ridgely's nightmare) always comes 
   on to him and he always turns her down (After one instance of turning 
   her down, she strips topless at the pool in front of the pool boy and 
   starts coming on to him. He ends up being scared to death and leaves 
   the pool with his bathing suit half-on, screaming &quot;My mother 
   told me about women like you!&quot; It's really funny.). He also 
   chastizes Victoria about not having a full-time nurse on duty and 
   makes her hire Nurse Turner (Leslie Simms) to take care of her father 
   (Ridgely accuses Victoria of poisoning his food, which is believable 
   considering what a manipulative bitch she is). Craig has a moment of 
   weakness and decides to take Victoria up on her offer and starts 
   having an affair with her, in hopes he can borrow the $50,000 he so 
   desperately needs. Victoria also has a bad amyl nitrate 
   (&quot;poppers&quot;) habit and Craig tells her that it could do 
   irreparable harm to her heart and she should stop using it. She tells 
   Craig that she doesn't have the $50,000 to give him right now (she 
   thinks he is having IRS problems), but she knows how she can get it 
   for him. Meanwhile, Craig's girlfriend Cheryl invites Larry Miller 
   over to the apartment (without Craig knowing about it) and she offers 
   to have sex with Larry if he will call off the blackmail. Instead, 
   Miller slaps her around and rapes her, saying after he is done, 
   &quot;No deposits. You're good, but you're not that good!&quot; and 
   walks out the door. Victoria sneaks into her sleeping father's 
   bedroom and opens a couple of vials of amyl nitrate under his nose. 
   He dies of a heart attack a short time later (he pops up into the 
   sitting position in his bed as a muscle reflex and the look on his 
   face is the film's scariest moment). Victoria tells Craig what she 
   has done and uses sex to hold the $50,000 over his head (Craig, who 
   really is a nice guy, says to her, &quot;You're a bitch!&quot;). 
   Victoria now believes that she is a rich woman, but the family lawyer 
   (Alex Rocco: <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Stanley">STANLEY</A></B> 
   - 1972; in what amounts to an extended cameo) says the reading of the 
   will cannot take place until at least two weeks because the auditors 
   have to get the exact amount of Ridgely's fortune together and she 
   also has to wait for her younger sister Gail (Vicki Peters) to arrive 
   with her guardian Kate Lewis (Jacqueline Dalya). When the will is 
   read, Nurse Miller is given $1,500 (&quot;I'm rich!&quot;), but the 
   rest of his fortune goes to Gail. Ridgely says in the will that 
   Victoria is allowed to stay in the mansion and receive a small yearly 
   stipend and Craig's clinic is to receive $10,000 a year. Victoria has 
   a nervous breakdown and Craig hires Nurse Miller to look after her. 
   Craig and Gail become romantically involved (by this time in the 
   film, Cheryl is never seen again, in one of the screenplay's biggest 
   holes), as we see them go to a Renaissance Fair and frolic on the 
   beach. Craig wants to have Victoria admitted to a psychiatric 
   hospital because he is afraid she is going to turn violent. It comes 
   a little too late, as Gail offers Victoria half the fortune, but 
   Victoria bashes a nude Gail (who was taking a bath) over the head 
   repeatedly (we see quick bloody edits of Gail's head) and then drags 
   her dead nude body in a rug into another room. Craig calls Gail on 
   the phone, but a truly loony Victoria answers the phone and tells 
   Craig she is unavailable. Craig rushes to the mansion as quickly as 
   he can and finds Victoria painting with blood. Craig discovers Gail's 
   dead body in the bathtub of another room. He begins to cry and 
   carries Gail's body to his car, telling Victoria she knows what he 
   has to do: report her to the police and have her committed. But in a 
   strange turn of events in the finale, Larry Miller comes into 
   Victoria's studio carrying the nude body of Gail and when Craig looks 
   at Victoria's painting, it is a remarkable resemblance of him 
   carrying a bloody skeleton. That can only mean one thing: Craig is 
   fucked for the rest of his life. He can never go to the police 
   because it is he that will look guilty. In this film, nice guys 
   finish last.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like I said, most of the film is pure soap 
   opera, followed by plentiful nudity, a few jump scares and a 
   smattering of blood. But it is Carpenter's performance that keeps the 
   film interesting as a man who is just trying to do the right thing, 
   but everyone is working against him. Also interesting are the people 
   behind the camera. Director Robert Vincent O'Neill (billed here

   story has many holes (The disappearance of Cheryl from the film after 
   being raped; Why did Kate leave without telling anyone goodye? Why 
   doesn't Craig just kill Larry Miller and Victoria and blame their 
   deaths on each other? Cheryl's corpse would have surely implicated 
   Victoria in her death and she and Larry could have &quot;killed&quot; 
   each other because Larry was the last one to hold Cheryl's corpse.)

   been a major genre film star. Originally released&nbsp; on fullscreen

   Ms. Peters said was &quot;distant&quot; towards her. She was best 
   friends with Chip Smith until his untimely death in 2001 at the young

   had nothing nice things to say about him (she was the youngest and 
   most inexperienced actress in the cast and Carpenter always was there 
   to make her as comfortable as possible), but seems unwilling to talk 
   about any future dealings with him. I'm usually not a conspiracy

   It's March of 2021 as I am writing this and I have just discovered 
   that Peter Carpenter didn't die in the '70s as many people thought. 
   He actually quit acting in 1971 when his career as an actor didn't 
   pan out like he thought it would and went into hiding in Los Angeles, 
   California, opening up a dance studio under his real name (Nathaniel 
   Joseph Carpenter), where he taught dance and then became a painter, 
   dying on April 2, 1996 of A.I.D.S. at the age of 56 (not of natural 
   causes as it is erroneously reported on IMDb). It was easy to hide 
   from the public in the '70s, '80s &amp; early-'90s, since the 
   Internet wasn't around and long before everyone had a camera at their 
   disposal, so Carpenter lived his life, dated many beautiful women and 
   ran a business where no one noticed him. Still, it's a sad ending for 
   someone who I admired. He had all the elements to become a good genre 
   actor, but he made his decision and stood by it. Another long mystery resolved!</FONT></FONT></P>

   walking alone in the woods. Dr. Phillip Stevens (Wayne Dvorak), who 
   heads the encounter group, has the people introduce themselves to 
   each other by &quot;milling&quot;, a technique where he turns out the 
   lights and they grope each other. While the lights are out, someone 
   bites one of the women on her breast and draws blood, sending her to 
   the infirmiry. Allison (Claudia Jennings) has come to the island to 
   escape her abusive boyfriend, Bud (Ed Blessington), but her follows 
   her to the island and begins to get abusive with her in front of 
   everyone else. Morris (Albert Popwell) steps in to break it up and he 
   tells Allison that he would like nothing better than to give Bud a 
   knuckle sandwich, but she stops Morris before he can. Bud, in 
   retaliation, gets picked-up by another woman and has sex with her, 
   which visibly upsets Allison. Mousey stutterer George (Greg

   Allison's strife and gives her a shoulder to cry on. As more personal 
   drama unfolds on the island, Allison incredibly <A HREF="bloody_friday_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bloody friday vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="136" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>makes

   scenes that make no sense and people doing stupid things. Why Allison 
   keeps going back to Bud is the most maddening aspect of this film. 
   He's a jerk of the highest order, yet he's made one of the heroes of 
   the film, which is this flick's biggest fault. Another fault with 
   this film is that there are just too many characters here to keep 
   track of or care about. Besides the ones already mentioned, there's 
   the impotent Andrew (Victor Izay), virgin Lola (Joan Prather), cowboy 
   Blue (Jason Ledger), trampy Shannon (Cheri Howell), sexpot Cathy 
   (Mercy Rooney) and a half dozen others. The are given a few moments 
   of screen time and then they are either dispatched or forgotten. The 
   film also seems to be severely edited. There are many freeze frames 
   or jump cuts when the violence is about to be shown. This could be 
   because Ferd Sebastian had a heart attack during the 80's (this film 
   was released on VHS by Ferd &amp; Beverly's &quot;Sebastian 
   International Enterprises&quot; label), became a born-again Christian 
   and is now a minister! He may have edited it because the violence 
   doesn't conform with his religious beliefs. What's truly 
   head-scratching is that Bud disappears during the final minutes of 
   the film, never to be seen again. When George confronts the killer at 
   the end, there's a freeze frame on the killer's face, followed by a 
   shot of George and Allison walking hand-in-hand down the beach 
   discussing what they'll be doing on their first date. It's apparent 
   that a good chunk of the film is missing, as we never find out the 
   fates of the killer or Bud. It's a cheat on the viewer. Besides some 
   fleeting nudity, this film (at least in this version) is not worth 
   your time. Originally released to theaters as <B><A HREF="single_girls_1973.htm">THE

    JO AND THE OUTLAW</A><A NAME="BobbieJoOutlaw"></A> (1975) -</B> Lyle 
   Wheeler (Marjoe Gortner) is a con artist and quick-draw champion who 
   likens himself to a modern-day Billy The Kid. He steals an orange 
   Ford Mustang, runs a patrol car off the road and meets carhop Bobbie 
   Jo Baker (Lynda Carter). It's love at first sight. Bobbie Jo dreams 
   of becoming a famous country singer (she sings Lyle one of her 
   original songs on their first date), but she's going to have to put 
   that dream on hold because she and Lyle are about to have an 
   adventure. Lyle teaches Bobbie Jo how to shoot a pistol (&quot;It's 
   just like praying!&quot;) and shows her how to cheat at pinball by 
   palming a magnet (He hustles one guy for $40 at a pool hall and has 
   to fight the guy off with his car's radio antennae in the parking 
   lot). Bobbie Jo's best friend, Essie (Belinda Balaski), joins Lyle 
   and Bobbie Jo on their travels and soon they are tripping out on 
   magic mushrooms while wading naked in a pond with an elderly Indian, 
   where Lyle has a premonition of his death. When a cop tries to pull 
   Lyle over for driving the stolen car, it leads to a chase where the 
   cop car crashes and explodes (the cop is OK, though). They go to 
   borrow some money from Bobbie Jo's stripper sister, Pearl (Merrie 
   Lynn Ross), and her coke-sniffing boyfriend, Slick Callahan (Jesse 
   Vint), but Slick gets Lyle involved in a robbery where he is forced 
   to shoot and kill a security guard. With roadblocks at every exit out 
   of town, they all disguise themselves as Christians heading to a 
   revival meeting and they escape, but all is not <A HREF="bobbie_jo_and_the_outlaw_1975.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bobbie jo and the outlaw poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>peaceful

   Lyle and Essie wants everyone to turn themselves in after watching 
   Sheriff Hicks (Gene Drew) on TV threaten to &quot;hunt them down like 
   dogs&quot; if they don't give up. Essie secretly calls the Sheriff 
   and makes a deal with him, which backfares terribly, leading to a 
   shootout in a trailer park that leaves Essie and several policemen 
   dead. Essie dies in Lyles arms of a shotgun blast to the stomach and 
   Lyle delivers a sermon over her makeshift grave (which came natural 
   to Gortner, since he was a fire-and-brimstone teenage preacher before 
   he became an actor). The remaining foursome decide to rob a bank, but 
   first they rob a gun store for weapons, which leads to a shootout 
   where Bobbie Jo kills her first man and she seems to enjoy it. 
   There's no turning back now. After many gun battles, a bank robbery, 
   a Wild West showdown and several close calls, Lyle, Slick and Pearl 
   meet their maker while Bobbie Jo is captured, her fate uncertain. One 
   thing is clear: She can kiss her country music career goodbye.&nbsp; 
   This mid-70's exploitationer, directed by Mark L. Lester (<B><A HREF="#TruckStopWomen">TRUCK

    WOMAN</A></B> Lynda Carter's naked breasts. Although co-stars Merrie 
   Lynn Ross and Belinda Balaski spend much of their screen time 
   topless, Ms. Carter was very frugal in showing off her tits. So 
   frugal, in fact, that Lester is forced to repeat one scene of a 
   topless Carter making love to Gortner a second time later in the 
   film. Marjoe Gortner has a natural screen presence and his starring 
   turn here is a good one. His portrayal of Lyle as a good-natured 
   criminal who gets caught-up in violence seems natural and unforced. 
   Scripter Zimmerman puts in constant swipes at religion in this film, 
   highly unusual for an exploitationer. The film is full of religious 
   diatribes, some obvious (Gortner's comparing firing a gun to praying 
   and his sermon at Essie's graveside) and some not-so-obvious (the 
   $100 bill that Gortner leaves under one of his victim's hands so he 
   can &quot;have a good funeral&quot;). Bobbie Jo and Pearl's mother, 
   Hattie (Peggy Stewart), is also a devout religious woman, yet her 
   daughters turn out to be a strippers and women who can stand to be 
   around her. Hattie's true colors show through loud-and-clear when 
   it's revealed that she made a deal with Sheriff Hicks to turn both of 
   her daughters in for $50! Another taste of Zimmerman's distaste of 
   religion comes when Sheriff Hicks and his men shoot-up a motel room 
   only to discover that they have killed three innocent people inside. 
   Sheriff Hicks looks at the bullet-ridden, bloody bodies, turns to his 
   deputy and says, &quot;With the Lord's will, they is sinners!&quot; A 
   telling, remarkable scene. The violence doesn't kick-in until the 
   second half of the film and it's mostly just bloody bullet squibs, 
   although some of it is nasty. I'm a big fan of director Lester's 
   films and <B><A HREF="bobbie_jo_and_the_outlaw_1975c.htm">BOBBIE JO

   the same location to retrieve the package from Larry and, while the 
   plan is still unclear, you can bet it's as crooked as a hillbilly's 
   teeth. What Ben, Eddy and Digger don't count on, though, is that 
   Larry and Ellie hook-up and sleep together. They pick up the package 
   together and when Myra phones Ellie and tells her that the police 
   have discovered Charley's body and they are wanted for questioning, 
   Ellie opens the package (against Larry's wishes) and finds a 
   briefcase containing $400,000. Seeing this as a chance for her and 
   Myra to finally disappear for good, Ellie steals the money and tells 
   Myra to meet her in El Paso. This sets off a series of violent 
   encounters that finds Larry and Ellie trying to escape the clutches 
   of Ben, Eddy and Digger. The finale shows that both Ellie and Myra

   all those bad rumors about their dead mother are true after all. It 
   doesn't end pleasantly for either Ellie or Myra, as one will end up

    of bloody violence, softcore sex and a great cast of genre veterans. 
   There are a few scenes that really stand out, such as when Myra tells 
   Diana that she's leaving for El Paso to be with her sister. Diana, 
   who has been having a lesbian affair with Myra, doesn't want her to 
   leave, but Myra unleashes this uncalled-for bit of dialogue in 
   Diana's face: &quot;Face it, you're a dyke, a lesbian, a no-good 
   queer!&quot; This line makes Diana blow her own brains out with a 
   revolver and when Myra sees her lifeless body on the floor, all she 
   has to say is, &quot;What a creep!&quot;. Myra proves to be the most 
   unlikable character in the film, as she is the lynchpin for every bad 
   thing that happens here. She uses everyone (including her sister) to 
   get her way and knows exactly what she is doing, using her teenage 
   body to get people to do things they wouldn't normally do. If she 
   didn't come-on to Charley's friends at a poker game in the beginning 
   of the film, it wouldn't have led to the events that forced Ellie to 
   shoot Charley. It's no wonder that Myra's only true friend is her pet 
   rat (insert symbolism here). It's not until fairly late into the film 
   that we discover that Myra picked up her character traits from her 
   older sister, when Ellie finally shows her true colors with Larry. 
   The film is full of quotable dialogue, but my favorite line comes 
   when one of Charley's poker buddies spits out this nugget to describe 
   Charley's demeanor: &quot;You've always got the three M's: You're 
   mean, miserable and de-mented!&quot; The final line of dialogue 
   (which I will not repeat here) is a classic example of cinematic 
   heartlessness. <B><A HREF="bonnies_kids_1973.htm">BONNIE'S KIDS</A></B>

   and throws him down the stairs and tries to escape the house. She 
   runs into the room where the vampire girl is staying, forcing Carlos 
   to stake the girl with a broom handle. Seeing this, Juan chases 
   Yvonne only to have her expose him to sunlight and dissolve. After 
   Madame Von Kirst determines that the baby Yvonne is carrying is 
   normal and the curse has been lifted, Carlos goes upstairs to tell 
   Yvonne the good news. When he opens the door he finds that Yvonne has 
   broken a mirror and has plunged a giant shard of it into her stomach.

   fashions, muttonchops and amateur acting, this film is a testament 
   that anyone with a camera could make a film in the 70's and get it a 
   release. It's hard to keep up with the story as the entire film is 
   told in flashback and sometimes as a flashback within a flashback. 
   This film does not have much going for it as it contains minimal 
   nudity, a no-no for a film of this type. The ending also makes no 
   sense as the boy in the beginning states that he is the son of Juan, 
   who has died in the film and Yvonne kills herself and her baby in the 
   end. Just when did Juan father this child? I could have thought of a

   Lower-tier blaxploitation effort about race relations, the KKK and 
   death in a small Southern town (actually filmed in Montgomery County, 
   Maryland). When Raymond (Roy Jefferson), his brother Junior (Haskell 
   Anderson) and friend Ned (Le Tari) run afoul of local redneck Leroy

   return home and to the trouble they thought they left behind. When a 
   local black girl is raped by Leroy and two of his white friends,

   try to enact change in the town legally and non-violently by getting

   crooked district attorney, who also heads the local KKK chapter as 
   their &quot;Grand Cyclops&quot; (he wears a pink KKK robe and hood!),

   the only white man in town who was fair with the blacks. The new

   kidnapped Leroy and the district attorney and are holding them in a 
   shack in the woods. The trio don their Army fatigues and use their 
   jungle warfare training to get even with the KKK (they even trick the 
   KKK into killing Leroy and the D.A. by taping their mouths shut and 
   putting black hoods on their heads!). Using guns, booby traps, 
   poisonous snakes and landmines (even pulling a Cleavon Little in <B><A HREF="blazing_saddles_1974.htm">BLAZING

   member to thin the ranks), the vengeful trio kill all the KKK members 
   and make the town a safe place for all the black folks to vote and 
   elect their own D.A. and sheriff. Don't you just love happy 
   endings?&nbsp; This cheaply-made blaxploitation flick has lots of 
   stock footage (when the church is burned down, it's just stock 
   footage of a house fire), bad acting and it takes forever to get 
   moving. This film is nothing but a series of racial diatribes, as the 
   white actors are required to say &quot;nigger&quot; at least one time 
   in every line of dialogue. Director Bill Berry paints every white 
   person (except for the sheriff) as a bigot and every black person as 
   a good guy, which makes this whole affair hard to swallow (even 
   during the Vietnam sequences, the only white soldier shown is a 
   heroin addict/dealer). Add to that nothing but talk, talk, talk and 
   too little action (the final sequence lasts less than five minutes) 
   and what you end up with is an action film that is anything but. 
   There is only one instance of nudity (the rape scene), several bloody 
   bullet squibs and one throat slashing in the film's entire 77 minute 
   running time. All that's left is plenty of racist dialogue (on both 
   sides of the coin), lame politics (it seemed dated, even for 1976) 
   and lots of amateur acting. I will give the film a few points for 
   superimposing it's end credits on a real KKK recruitment billboard, 
   though. It's the film's most imaginative moment. Too bad you have to 
   wallow through a lot of crap to get there. It should come as no 
   surprise that there is no on-screen screenplay credit (Who would want 
   to take credit for this crap?), although I suspect Bill Berry is the 
   culprit. Berry only has one other directorial credit, the 1987 comedy <B>OFF

   The Colonel (Charles Macauley; <B><A HREF="blacula_1972.htm">BLACULA</A></B> 
   - 1972); are traveling down a road in Mexico, when they stop at a 
   closed gas station to steal some gas for their Jeep and truck. Quinn 
   uses the outhouse to take a shit, when four thugs on motorcycles stop 
   at the station and tell Quinn to get out because the biker leader has 
   to take a piss (Jeez, the ground isn't good <A HREF="brute_corps_1971_dvd.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/brute corps dvd8a front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="2"></A>enough?).
    When Quinn refuses, they shake the outhouse off its foundation and 
   Quinn leaves, saying &quot;Fuck you&quot; to all four of them (one of 
   them makes a joke that Quinn's penis looked like a &quot;Baby Tootsie 
   Roll&quot;), pulling out a shotgun and blasting them all to death (he 
   shoots two in the back after they try to get away). We now know that 
   none of these mercenaries have much in the way of humanity, except 
   for Ross, who seems weary of the whole mercenary thing. A few minutes 
   before, these mercenaries didn't pick up a female hitchhiker named 
   Terry (Jennifer Billingsley; <B><A HREF="#HollywoodMan">HOLLYWOOD MAN</A></B> 
   - 1976), but Wicks leers at her as they pass her by. She manages to 
   get a ride with another hitchhiker named Kevin (Joseph Kaufmann; <B><A HREF="private_duty_nurses_1971.htm">PRIVATE
    DUTY NURSES</A></B> - 1971), as a pink pickup truck picks them both 
   up. They become quick friends and decide to travel together. Both 
   Terry and Kevin and the mercenaries end up in the same small Mexican 
   town, run by corrupt Sheriff Alvarez (Joseph Bernard; <B><A HREF="baby_1974.htm">THE
    BABY</A></B> - 1974), who offers to make the Colonel and his men's 
   stay there pleasurable. The Colonel is not interested in his offer 
   and he plans on setting up camp a couple of miles from town in an 
   abandoned quarry while he waits for more mercenaries to show up for 
   an operation they are going to perform in Central America. Meanwhile, 
   the mercenaries at the bar are getting drunk and having a good time, 
   so Wicks offers the barmaid's father money so he can have sex with 
   his daughter. The father turns him down and Wicks shoots him in the 
   hand. When the father complains to Sheriff Alvarez, Wicks puts a live 
   hand grenade in the father's hand and the Sheriff has to toss it away 
   before it explodes. The Sheriff tells the father, &quot;It was his 
   idea of a joke.&quot; We then see Terry and Kevin frolicking naked in 
   a shallow pool of water at the quarry. Terry says she should have 
   become a hooker because she likes to &quot;ball&quot;. Kevin tells 
   her that he is in Mexico dodging the draft because he is a 
   concientious objector and the thought of him killing anyone makes him 
   sick. He'll have to change that stance sooner than he thinks. They 
   run into Wicks at the quarry and he invites them both to have lunch 
   with the group. When the Colonel sees them, he tells Wicks to get rid 
   of them after they eat. They all pass a joint around and talk about 
   death, when Wicks pulls out a stick of dynamite, lights the fuse and 
   tosses it to Hill, who tosses it to another member, etc., while 
   Jennifer looks on horrified (Wick says, &quot;This is what it is all 
   about!&quot;). As the fuse gets dangerously small, Ross makes Wicks 
   pull the fuse out of the dynamite (Ross is really sick of this 
   psychotic behavior by his comrades). The mercenaries then show Terry 
   how to fight, but Kevin gets increasingly mad (and not just because 
   he is a pacifist), especially when he sees Wicks putting his hands on 
   her breasts. The Colonel tells Wicks to get rid of Terry and Kevin 
   and let them go on their way, but Wicks says &quot;Colonel. I want to 
   have her!&quot; The Colonel decides that the four mercenaries that 
   want to fuck her should fight each other in one-on-one bouts, the 
   winner getting possession of Terry. Ross volunteers as one of the men 
   because he wants to save Terry, not fuck her. During the fighting, 
   Kevin escapes, so Quinn and Ross head into separate directions to 
   catch him, with the Colonel telling them not to bring Kevin back 
   alive. Ross has Kevin in his sights, but lets him go back into town. 
   Quinn accuses Ross of letting him go, saying &quot;He ain't got 
   it&quot; (because Ross refuses to kill for killing's sake). The 
   fighting then starts to see who gets to fuck Terry and Ross beats 
   Hill by almost killing him as he hangs from a tree (Hill taps out) 
   and Wicks beats MacFarland unconscious with a tree branch and he wins 
   his bout. Wicks cheats and beats Ross, which make him the winner to 
   screw Terry and he rapes Terry after tying her to the bed. He then 
   cuts the ropes that binds her and says she is free to go, only to 
   have all the other mercenaries (sans Ross) gang-rape her. Kevin makes 
   it to town, but Sheriff Alvarez is very unreceptive (he won't even 
   help Kevin after he shames the Sheriff in front of the rest of the 
   town). Kevin heads back to the quarry by himself, where he sees Terry 
   being treated like an animal, a rope tied around her neck like a 
   leash. Kevin gets some much-needed help from Ross, as Kevin kills 
   Wicks for making Terry say she is an animal. When the Colonel sees 
   Ross escaping with Terry and Kevin, the rest of the mercenaries head 
   out on foot (Ross has disabled the vehicles) and soon it is Rambo 
   time (a good ten years before Rambo even drew first blood). Hill and 
   Ballard are killed by Ross' grenade booby trap. Ross seriously 
   injures Quinn with a hand grenade and finishes him off with Quinn's 
   own shotgun. In a real downer of a finale. MacFarland kills Kevin 
   (even though Kevin has a gun but refuses to use it), the Sheriff 
   shoots Ross in the back and Terry shoots and kills The Colonel. The 
   only good thing to happen in the finale is that the population of the 
   small town get to see what a coward the Sheriff really is. This 
   short, 84-minute film only exists to show how people can mistreat 
   other people without having a conscience. Kevin is a coward who runs 
   away from war, only to die at the hands of people worse than the 
   Vietcong. Terry is one giant cocktease, who has no choice at the end 
   but to kill and it is not in retribution for killing Kevin or Ross. 
   She does it strictly for her own personal reasons (She proves she is 
   an animal at the end). The only person in the entire film with a 
   conscience is Ross, who does his damnedest to save Kevin and Terry, 
   not knowing what kind of people these two really are; A coward and a 
   whore. The film is nothing but wall-to-wall violence and sexual 
   abuse, but it has a cast of great character actors (most who are no 
   longer with us) that rarely get together in any type of film. The 
   film has the look and feel of a TV movie, which is not surprising 
   since Jerry Jameson has been working in that medium since the 
   early-60's. Screenwriters Michael Kars and Abe Polsky (who also 
   co-wrote the screenplay to the biker film <B><A HREF="rebel_rousers_1970.htm">THE
    REBEL ROUSERS</A></B> - 1970) were also the Producers of <B><A HREF="brute_corps_1971.htm">BRUTE
    CORPS</A></B> but didn't have much of a film career after this film. 
   This was Kars' last film credit and Polsky would go on to write the 
   screenplay to the cult film <B><A HREF="baby_1974.htm">THE BABY</A></B> 
   (1974) and then disappear from films. This film never had a VHS or 
   home video release before the beautiful widescreen DVD from Code Red. 
   If you want to watch a scuzzy, slimey film that could have only come 
   from the 70's, then get this DVD ASAP before it goes OOP. Also

   (1992), may I suggest that you go out and buy, rent or stream this 
   stylish comedy/horror/semi-historical film that stars some of today's 
   top British actors, as well as some unexpected cameos. It's the 
   1820's in Edinburgh, Scotland and two warring doctors, Dr. Robert 
   Knox (Tom Wilkinson; <B><A HREF="exorcism_of_emily_rose_2005.htm">THE 
   EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE</A></B> - 2005, who is simply fantastic here) 
   and Dr. Monro (Tim Curry; <B><A HREF="ritual _2002.htm">RITUAL</A></B> 
   - 2002), who has a thing for the anatomy of human feet (!), are 
   looking for fame and fortune in a city that can best be described as 
   a shithole's asshole. Enter conmen William Burke (Simon Pegg; <B><A HREF="shaun_of_the_dead_2003.htm">SHAUN

   wife, Lucky (Jessica Hyndes [a.k.a. &quot;Jessica Stevensen&quot;; <B><A HREF="magicians_2007.htm">MAGICIANS</A></B> 
   - 2007], in a commanding performance), will be kicked out of their 
   apartment. When an old man who was subletting one of their apartment 
   rooms dies, Burke and Hare get the bright idea of selling his body to 
   Dr. Knox, who is working<A HREF="burke_and_hare_2010b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/burke &amp; hare poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="299" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   on a new way to study the internal workings of the human body: 
   photography (Knox is credited in this film for coming up with the 
   word). When the old dead man won't fit into a barrel, they have to 
   break his back to make him fit inside (a funny visual later in the 
   film). They take the body to Dr. Knox, who offers them 5 Pounds for 
   every fresh body they bring him. Meanwhile, Burke meets the beautiful 
   Ginny Hawkins (Isla Fisher: <B><A HREF="scooby_doo_2002.htm">SCOOBY-DOO</A></B> 
   - 2002), whose dream it is to put on an all-female version of 
   Shakespeare's Hamlet at the local theater. Hoping to score some sex 
   with Ginny (who is one of the greatest cockteases in film history), 
   Burke agrees to finance her venture, which means they are going to 
   have to actually kill people to supply Dr. Knox with more bodies. 
   Their first attempt at murder is a complete failure. They try pushing 
   a drunk (Paul Whitehouse) down a long flight of stairs, but he simply 
   gets up and goes on his merry way. They begin a murder spree (one of 
   their victims is Old Joseph, played by none other than Christopher 
   Lee) and begin to make a lot of money. Lucky wants her husband to 
   quit the killings when they have enough money to start the very first 
   &quot;funeral parlor&quot;, but Ginny's venture is costing Burke a 
   fortune and proves their undoing. They are dogged by Captain Tam 
   McLintoch (Ronnie Corbett, a popular British TV comedian) and his two 
   privates (one who keeps fainting at the sight of dead bodies). When 
   Captain McLintoch is able to see the photographs and match them to 
   the drawings of all the missing people, Burke, Hare, Lucky and an 
   innocent Ginny are locked up. Even back then the government would 
   like to have something like this covered-up, so they make Burke and 
   Hare and offer: If one of them confesses to the crimes, he will hang 
   and the rest will go free (They also make an offer to Captain 
   McLintoch that he can't possibly refuse). Burke confesses to the 
   crimes (In reality, Hare sold him out) and Ginny finally has sex with 
   him on the night before he is to be executed. When he is asked if he 
   has any last words before the hangman's rope squeezes all the life 
   out of his body, all Burke has to say is, &quot;I did it for 
   love&quot;. The government burns all the photographs, Ginny goes on 
   to a successful career as an actress and Hare and Lucky open the 
   first funeral parlor.&nbsp; I'm afraid that what I have just written 
   cannot describe how funny this entire film is. There were many times 
   I found myself laughing out loud, like when their first body in a 
   barrel gets away from them, when they try to make a freed slave 
   (Chris Obi) one of their victims (it takes Lucky to bring him down) 
   or when Tim Curry looks at a human foot like a horny man would look 
   at a vagina. The screenplay by Piers Ashworth and Nick Moorcroft is 
   full of historical facts mixed with outright lies, but you won't 
   care. You'll love the film for the funny visuals, dialogue and looks 
   on Simon Pegg's face (who is always a joy to watch, especially when 
   he says things like &quot;I had confidence in a fart once, and I shat 
   all over myself.&quot;, as is Andy Serkis, who was robbed of an 
   Academy Award nomination as Caesar in <B><A HREF="rise_of_the_planet_of_the_apes_2011.htm">RISE

   of <B><A HREF="telefon_1977.htm">TELEFON</A> </B>(1977), this film 
   opens with a prominent female politician receiving a mysterious phone 
   call (&quot;The apples are dying!&quot;) and then a package just 
   before she is to give a press conference. She then goes into a 
   trance, straps on a vest bomb underneath her dress and heads down to 
   the conference, where she detonates the bomb, killing everyone. We 
   then follow Canadian girl Denise (Bernadette Williams) as she is 
   taken prisoner and driven to some remote camp in the Asian jungle. 
   The warden of the camp, Van Duc (Joe Mari Avellana), tells Denise 
   that escape is impossible, but if she does what she is told, she will 
   eventually be released. The camp is full of young female prisoners 
   and it becomes apparent after a short while that the women are being 
   &quot;conditioned&quot; (i.e. brainwashed) to become &quot;human 
   bombs&quot; to be used in situations where it would be next to 
   impossible to use regular hitmen or assassins. All it takes is a 
   simple phone call s<A HREF="caged_fury_1983b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/caged fury vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>aying
    a particular phrase (&quot;The apples are dying!&quot;) and the 
   women don vest bombs and carry out their missions. While Denise tries 
   to find a way to escape, Van Duc discovers that one of the women 
   prisoners, Linda (Jennifer Lane), is actually an undercover CIA 
   operative, so he has electrodes attached to her breasts and tortures 
   her with electricity. Denise begins a romance with friendly guard 
   Pram Van Tin (Efren Reyes Jr.) and he agrees to help her escape once 
   he witnesses the after-effects of her brainwashing electric shock 
   treatments. When Pram tries to smuggle Denise out of the camp in the 
   back of a truck and Van Duc is waiting for them at the front gate, it 
   proves that one of the women prisoners is an informer. But which one 
   is it? All evidence points to Honey (Taffy O'Connell), an American 
   who sleeps with most of the guards and spends too much time in Van 
   Duc's office, but that would be too easy. Denise and Pram still 
   manage to escape, but Van Duc's men are only one step behind them. 
   After they make love in a jungle cabin, Pram is shot dead by his 
   fellow guards and Denise is brought back to the camp, where she is 
   tortured. All the girls are then loaded onto a train and told that 
   they are going home, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. The 
   train stops in the middle of a field and the guards gang-rape all the 
   women and shoot those in the back that try to escape. The remaining 
   women discover the identity of the informer, kill her and then take 
   over the train, where they escape to the safety of a waiting 
   helicopter. Are the women actually saved or will a simple phone call 
   turn them into explosive assassins? I'm afraid only time will 
   tell.&nbsp; A lot of people believe that this is Filipino director 
   Cirio H. Santiago's best film and I can't really fault them for 
   thinking that. While not as action-packed as most of Santiago's 80's 
   films, it is better plotted than most (script by frequent Santiago 
   bit player Bobby Greenwood) and probably contains more nudity than 
   half a dozen of his other films put together. Santiago also tosses-in 
   much more human drama than usual, especially the romance between 
   Denise and Pram that ends tragically. There is also a mystery element 
   as we try to determine who's the informer and it's not as easy as you 
   think. Santiago films the mass rape on the train as a series of slow-motion
    shots, edited in such a way as to show the fear and helplessness in 
   all the women's faces while the guards leer and laugh and shoot women 
   in the back like they were shooting skeet. It's a very effective 
   sequence, as is Pram's gunfight with his fellow guards, which takes 
   place next to a pen of loudly-chirping baby chicks. This was also one 
   of the few Santiago films that wasn't financed by Roger Corman.

    early-90's output, where boss Corman, who Santiago almost worked

   (Ramon D'Salva; <B><A HREF="action.htm#LiveByTheFist">LIVE BY THE FIST</A></B> 
   - 1993) being shot several times by protestors who do not like his 
   policies of kowtowing to the American military that occupies his 
   country. Lim's daughter, Marga (Chanel Akiko Hirai), is particularly 
   distressed that her father has the nerve to flout his American 
   mistress, Amanda (Jewel Shepard; <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#Raw Force">RAW
    FORCE</A></B> - 1982), out in public. When it turns out that the 
   shooting was staged so Lim and Marga could leave the country and live 
   in New York, a monkey wrench is thrown into the gears when Marga is 
   arrested and sentenced to spend the rest of her life on The Rock, an 
   inescapable maximum security prison located on an Alcatraz-like 
   island. Lim refuses to leave the country without his daughter (and 
   threatens to expose the American military's illegal dealings in his 
   country), so Amanda agrees to go undercover as a prisoner on the 
   island to break Marga out. Unfortunately, Amanda accidentally gets 
   American tourist Lucy (Susan Harvey) arrested at the airport (she has 
   a suitcase full of illegal porn films!), so she, too, is sent to The 
   Rock with Amanda. The Rock's horny Warden Chen (Vic Diaz; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Equalizer2000">EQUALIZER
    2000</A></B> - 1986) takes an instant dislike to Amanda (after 
   making her strip and trying to fondle her breasts, but he really has 
   his his eye on Marga as his next sexual conquest (He says, &quot;I 
   never had a princess before!&quot;). Amanda has it hard, trying to 
   protect Lucy from butch prisoner Paula (Pamella D'Pella) and 
   reasoning with Marga to escape with her from the prison (Marga would 
   rather be executed than be shamed by her father's treasonous 
   actions). After finally setting Marga straight about her father, 
   Amanda and Marga escape the prison and run into the jungle with the 
   help of two undercover guards. Their escape is short-lived when one 
   of the guards (Totoy Torres, here billed as &quot;Joe Towers&quot; in 
   the opening credits [but using his real name in the closing credits!] 
   and also the Assistant Director) turns out to be a traitor and Warden 
   Chen captures them on the beach. Warden Chen rapes Marga on the beach 
   and hangs Amanda by her hair before eventually throwing them both 
   back in their cells. The remainder of the film finds Amanda and Lucy 
   trying to break Marga out of prison before she is executed for crimes 
   against her country. Along the way, all three will suffer more 
   degradation, including rape (both lesbian and straight), forced drug 
   addiction and constant catfights with Paula and her gang of lesbos. 
   Will all three live to see freedom? When King Lim dies of a sudden 
   heart attack, everything changes and most of it is not good, both for 
   Marga and Lucy. Amanda has to decide if she is going to obey her new 
   orders from her CIA boss, Carl Daimyo (Ed Crick; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Naked Vengeance">NAKED
    VENGEANCE</A></B> - 1985) and escape from prison alone. Don't count 
   on it.&nbsp; This is a fairly by-the-numbers WIP flick which contains 
   all the usual standbys. Director Cirio H. Santaigo and screenwriter 
   Paul Ziller (who directed such genre films as <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#PledgeNight">PLEDGE
    NIGHT</A></B> [1988] and <B><A HREF="snakehead_terror_2003.htm">SNAKEHEAD
    TERROR</A></B> [2003]) fill this film with plenty of female nudity, 
   shower scenes, catfights, a whipping scene and lots of rape. This is 
   probably the biggest film role Vic Diaz had in the 90's and he looks 
   like he is having one helluva time here, whether it is stripping and 
   raping women in his office that contains one of the biggest bird 
   cages I have ever seen (filled with hundreds of birds), shooting 
   traitors and faithful guards with equal abandon or drugging women to 
   get them &quot;in the mood&quot;. The action scenes don't really come 
   until the final third, but the gunfights and explosions are 
   well-handled because Santiago was an old hand at this kind of stuff. 
   Nothing spectacular, but entertaining nonetheless. Also starring Bon 
   Vibar, Philip Gordon, Ronald Asinas, Manny Samson and Henry 
   Strzalkowski as an undercover CIA agent disguised as an ice cream

   from an unseen narrator, we get right to the film. Caligula (David 
   Brandon, as &quot;David Cain Haughton&quot;; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Stage Fright">STAGE
    FRIGHT</A></B> - 1987) is dreaming that he is running along a beach 
   and then is the target of an archer. As the archer pulls back the 
   string of the bow, we then see that Domitius (Michele Soavi, director 
   of <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Sect1991">THE SECT</A></B> - 1991) is 
   trying to strangle Caligula in his sleep. The guards stop him and 
   Caligula orders them to cut out Domitius' tongue, which they do (in 
   loving close-up). Caligula's personal slave Ulmar (Sasha D'Arc; <B><A HREF="sheriff_and_the_satellite_kid_1979.htm">THE
    SHERIFF AND THE SATELLITE KID</A></B> - 1979) is in charge of 
   protecting Caligula's life and he feels responsible for letting 
   Domitius get past him. Caligula forgives him and then tells his 
   second-in-command, Messala (Luciano Bartoli, as &quot;Oliver 
   Finch&quot;; <B><A HREF="fifth_cord_1971.htm">THE FIFTH CORD</A></B> 
   - 1971) about his dream, where the beach runs red with his enemy's 
   blood. We then watch as Caligula rapes virgin Livia (Fabiola Toledo; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#BladeInDark1983">A
    BLADE IN THE DARK</A></B> - 1983) in front of her betrothed, Ezio 
   (Alessandro &quot;Alex&quot; Freyberger; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Wild Beasts">WILD
    BEASTS</A></B> - 1983), the son of a Consul member. Livia tries to 
   stab Caligula, but Messala stops her, killing her in the process. 
   Caligula orders Messala to kill Ezio, which he does. At Ezio's 
   funeral, his father, Tulio Gallio (John Alin), asks Messala who 
   killed his son. Messala tells him &quot;religious fanatics&quot; 
   (Christians) were responsible and then we see Tulio's guards killing 
   a group of Christians. Some Consul members, led by Markus (Alfonso 
   Gigante), are secretly holding a meeting in a bathhouse, where they 
   discuss Ezio and Livia's deaths and don't believe they were killed by 
   Christians. Marcellus Agrippa (Gabriele Tinti; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#EmanuellePrison1983">EMANUELLE
    IN PRISON</A></B> - 1983) tells the group that he will &quot;find a 
   way&quot; to kill Caligula without putting suspicion on the Consul. 
   This involves getting Miriam (Laura Gemser; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#EmanuelleCannibal77">EMANUELLE
    AND THE LAST CANNIBALS</A></B> - 1977), a Christian and Livia's best

    Caligula wants a new amphitheater built in his honor and when he 
   learns how much it is going to cost, he finds a way to finance it by 
   holding a huge banquet, where only the richest of Romans will be 
   invited, Caligula bilking them of all their wealth. When members of 
   the Consul complain, Caligula fakes he is having an epileptic fit, 
   where Markus verbally prays to the god Jupiter to take his life in 
   place of Caligula. Instantly, Caligula is better and he orders his 
   guards to hold Markus while he runs him through with a sword 
   (Caligula says, &quot;He did offer his life, didn't he?&quot;). 
   Caligula should not play games with the Gods, because it will 
   eventually bite him in the ass.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see that Domitius is still alive and Caligula takes pleasure 
   in taunting him, even having a palace slut give him a handjob. Yes, 
   Caligula is human scum, who gets off on other people's misery. We 
   then witness one of Caligula's men picking out the women who will 
   attend the banquet. He picks only the beautiful women to pleasure the 
   men (He sticks his finger in one woman's vagina and then smells it!) 
   and Miriam is one of those women (an old hag begs to come to the 
   banquet, saying she is &quot;experienced&quot; in such matters, so 
   the man accepts her, saying she will be used to pleasure the dogs and 
   horses! And he means it!). The virgin Miriam pops her cherry with a 
   dildo so Caligula will think she is experienced. We then see all the 
   chosen women swimming naked in a pool, while one of Caligula's men 
   swims underwater, shoving dildoes into the surprised women's vaginas! 
   (D'Amato, who was also the cinematographer, shows the women bleeding 
   between their legs, turning the water around them red). The women are 
   then shown (by a gay man!) how to please a man (This is also the 
   first time the pornographic footage kicks in, showing one woman 
   performing oral sex on a man, while the other women masturbate around 
   her). We are then at the banquet, where Caligula holds court over his 
   wealthy Romans. There is an orgy (including a dwarf in the sex play 
   and the old hag giving a man a handjob!), jugglers with torches, 
   gladiators battling each other with their bare hands (crushing one 
   gladiator's head in with spiked brass knuckles) and other acts of 
   debauchery, while Marcellus Agrippa looks on with disgust. One 
   wealthy Roman gets his hands on Miriam, so Ulmar punches him out 
   (he's secretly in love with her) and brings her to Caligula. They 
   watch the orgy (Including scenes of homosexuality and lesbianism. It 
   wouldn't be a Roman orgy without them!) and we then see the old hag 
   giving a horse a handjob (Now I understand when they say &quot;hung 
   like a horse&quot;!). The orgy continues through the night (We even 
   see the dwarf getting a blowjob. Let's just say the horse doesn't 
   have anything to worry about!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Caligula falls hard for Miriam, but Miriam also falls hard for

   Will a jealous Ulmar get over his love for Miriam? Will Caligula 
   change his dastardly ways? If you answered &quot;no&quot; to these 
   three questions, you would be right. Let's say that the beach will 
   run red with blood, but whose blood will it be? And will the archer

    While there are explicit scenes of pornographic sex here (including 
   shots of ejaculation), don't expect Laura Gemser to participate in 
   them, because you will be disappointed. Gemser's sex scenes never 
   rise above softcore, just like in her more than a <A HREF="emanuelle_films_1973-1983.htm">dozen
    Emanuelle films</A>, many of them directed by Joe D'Amato. Speaking 
   of D'Amato. I consider this film, as well as his horror-themed <B><A HREF="porno_holocaust_1981.htm">PORNO
    HOLOCAUST</A></B> (1981), to be the precursors to his more than 150 
   porn films he made during the '80s, right up to his death in 1999. 
   This film also contains graphic scenes of violence, including the 
   aforementioned tongue cutting and Gabriele Tinti's death, where 
   Caligula has his men shove an iron spear up his ass until it exits 
   out of his left nipple! Also helping is the set decoration. The film 
   doesn't look like a typical porn film, as the sets are opulent and 
   the locations authentic-looking (The beach scenes were filmed in 
   Anzio, Italy and the rest of the film was shot at a studio in Rome). 
   If it's a sleaze-filled film you want, bursting with hardcore sex and 
   gratuitous, gory violence, look no further than this film, because 
   your prayers (to the gods Jupiter and Eros) have been answered. The 
   screenplay hits all the right notes, making this a sleazehound's 
   dream come true.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   one goon cuts off the right breast of one of his whores. All Baron's 
   whore's go into hiding or go to work for Dusty, temporarily putting 
   him out of business. Baron goes on the warpath and goes after all the 
   people who are harming his business. He goes to Dusty's place and 
   shoves the hand of the goon who cut his whore's tit off into a 
   garbage disposal. Before he is able to get to Dusty, the two vice 
   cops show up, but Baron gets away (Flower says, &quot;Black bastard's

   involves $250,000 in stolen bonds, which will finally end his 
   problems with Dusty, Di Nunzio and the vice cops. Baron gets all his 
   enemies to congregate at a restaurant, where he bursts in, gun 
   blazing, killing everyone (an effective slo-mo scene). He leads the 
   two vice cops on a car chase which ends up with the cops going over a

   and &quot;Featuring the Actual Hookers and Blades of the Sunset 
   Strip&quot;, is a gritty little blaxploitation item with a surprising 
   human side. We are not even aware of Baron's alter ego until a third 
   of the way through the film and it does come as a surprise to the 
   viewer. Baron tries hard to keep his two identities separate and 
   there's a comical scene where his next doot neighbor sees him on the 
   city street fully decked-out in pimp clothing and driving a $30,000 
   pimpmobile (complete with hidden machine guns next to the 
   headlights), yet she doesn't even recognize him (she actually gets 
   turned-on, while her fat female passenger says, &quot;They all look 
   alike to me. Let's go, I'm hungry!&quot;). The fact that Baron is the 
   only character who is portrayed as a semi-decent human being and 
   everyone else is a violent bigot, spewing vitriolic, racist dialogue 
   and killing everyone in sight. The scene near the finale, where the 
   two vice cops are teetering over a cliff in their car (Flower 
   screams, &quot;I swallowed my gum!&quot;) and try to make a deal with 
   Baron for their lives is one of the most comical and satisfying 
   pieces of cinema I have seen in quite a while. I actually enjoyed 
   this film and it's always nice to see the late George 'Buck' Flower 
   get a meaty role (he's both comical and brutal, as witnessed by his 
   rape of Heather). Matt Cimber (real name: Matteo Ottaviano, who was

   it? Wayne and Debbie hit it off. One of the girls, Afton (Janet 
   &quot;Janus&quot; Blythe), unsuccessfully tries to escape (she holds 
   George off with a chainsaw for a few moments). All of the girls put 
   their differences aside and formulate a plan of escape. While Wayne 
   and brother Billy are out collecting the ransom money, the girls use 
   their bodies and cheerleading experience to get even with their 
   captors. Using fire, cheerleading moves and a rope made from their 
   panties (!), the girls overpower Frankie, Big John (who shoots 
   himself in the foot) and George, throw them in the bus and drive off 
   to the waiting police. The girls, led by Debbie, let Wayne and Billy 
   get away with the ransom because thet are basically nice guys, after 
   all. I think I have a tear in my eye.&nbsp; This late 70's 
   sexploitation/crime drama, directed by Jeff Werner (<B><A HREF="die_laughing_1980.htm">DIE
    LAUGHING</A></B> - 1980), contains plenty of eye-popping nudity from 
   a cast of genre vets. While the plot may be standard &quot;Girls In 
   Peril&quot; stuff, the execution is pretty funny in spots (especially 
   the press conference) and there is palpable tension in some of the 
   later scenes. Although most of the violence is implied rather than 
   shown, there's more than enough action and female flesh on view to 
   keep even the most jaded viewer occupied. The ransom drop-off is 
   pretty amusing, especially when one of the cops (who says, &quot;Oh, 
   bat shit!&quot; a lot) describes a ransom plot he saw on a TV show a 
   couple of months before and his partner then realizes that they have 
   fallen for the same ruse. Wayne and Billy's final escape from the 
   cops after getting the ransom is filmed like a football game, 
   complete with passing, blocking, tackling and a Sousa marching tune 
   on the soundtrack. If you don't mind a lack of violence (no one is 
   killed), lots of naked women (and, really, who doesn't like that?) 
   and a playful sense of humor, this lighthearted film (also known as <B>THE

   a school system gone to the dogs (or, in this case, a gang of punks). 
   Brand new teacher Andrew Norris (Perry King) is assigned to the high

   to a gang of drug-pushing punks led by Peter Stegman (Timothy Van

    Terry Corrigan (Roddy McDowall), who carries a gun in his briefcase 
   and tells Andrew that if he wants to survive, he better learn to look 
   the other way (When Andrew spots the gun in Terry's briefcase, he 
   asks, &quot;What's the gun for?&quot; to which Terry replies, 
   &quot;Where have you been teaching lately?&quot;). Of course, being 
   the idealistic new teacher that he is, Andrew doesn't heed Terry's 
   warning and immediately pisses-off Stegman and his gang by throwing 
   them out of his first class; a band recital (where it is revealed 
   that Stegman is an accomplished classical pianist!). At first, the 
   gang's retribution is small stuff, like spray painting graffiti on 
   Andrew's car and squirting stage blood in his face, but it soon 
   develops into more serious (and deadly) retribution when Andrew 
   starts messing with their drug business. When one of his band 
   students freaks out after taking some of Stegman's drugs, climbs a 
   flagpole and falls off, killing himself, Andrew tries to get the dead 
   student's best friend Arthur (a baby-faced Michael J. Fox) to rat-out 
   Stegman, but he refuses because he knows that Stegman will have him 
   killed. After firebombing his car, setting up Andrew to make it look 
   like he beat the crap out of Stegman (Stegman brutally pummels 
   himself in front of Andrew) and killing all the animals in Terry's 
   biology lab (there are skinned rabbits on spits and a dead cat 
   hanging by a noose on view), Andrew finally gets wise and begins 
   dishing out punishment to Stegman that can't be traced back to him 
   (like trashing Stegman's car). Things get much worse when Stegman has 
   Arthur stabbed in the stomach, Terry goes crazy and holds Stegman and 
   his gang hostage with a gun in his class (Terry eventually dies later 
   that night when he tries to run over Stegman with his car and it 
   flips over and explodes) and Stegman and his punks kidnap and 
   gang-rape Andrew's pregnant wife Diane (Merrie Lynn Ross), giving 
   Andrew a Polaroid of the rape just as he is about to conduct the big 
   band concert in the school's gymnasium. Using Diane as bait, Stegman 
   tries to kill Andrew, but as the old saying goes, you can only push a 
   man so far before he tosses humanity into the wind. In the best 
   revenge film tradition, Andrew begins killing members of Stegman's 
   gang one-by-one, by table saw, immolation, lead pipe and crushed 
   under a car, until only Stegman is left. In the immortal words of 
   Stegman: &quot;Life is pain. Pain is everything.&quot;&nbsp; This

   Andrew's revenge spree in the finale. The reason why this film works 
   so well, though, is because it refuses to pull back or cop-out (even 
   though Stegman has a chance to have his like saved by Andrew, he 
   pulls out a knife and tries to slice Andrew when he offers a helping 
   hand) and the school is one of the dirtiest, graffiti-laden learning

   ton of racial stereotypes. Here, nearly every black and Latino 
   character is a drug pusher, drug user or gangbanger (or a combination 
   of all three), which may not sit too well with the NAACP or George

   celebrate her birthday, a local rival black gang shows up and kills 
   Rick's brother in a hail of gunfire. This causes Rick to once again 
   start wearing gang colors (he's an ex-gangbanger) and as new leader 
   of his brother's gang, he leads them on a raid of the black gang's 
   headquarters. After a massive shootout, the police, led by Lt. 
   Johnson (Richard Roundtree; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Killpoint">KILLPOINT</A></B> 
   - 1984), show up and Rick is arrested and jailed for attempted 
   murder. When Melissa comes to visit him in prison, Rick tells her to 
   forget about him because he is now a lost cause. Melissa is nearly 
   gang-raped by the drug-addled Chico (Albert Michel Jr.) and the rest 
   of the Latino gang (talk about loyalty!), but she is saved by B.T. 
   (Clyde R. Jones), a black drug dealer who hooks her on crack and 
   cocaine (Rape or drug addiction? Hmmm...that's a hard choice!). She 
   becomes B.T.'s (which stands for &quot;Big Time&quot;) crack whore 
   and her grades at school rapidly decline; so much so that teacher Mr. 
   Dockett (Anthony Geary; <B><A HREF="penitentiary_films.htm">PENITENTIARY
    III</A></B> - 1987) takes a personal interest in her. Since this is 
   a Cannon Film, we know that his interest in her is not pure in the 
   least. When B.T. is robbed of all his crack by Chico, he pimps out 
   Melissa to Mr. Dockett (who turns out to be a major drug pusher) in 
   exchange for some crack. The city's biggest black drug supplier, Mr. 
   Steadman (Jim Brown; <B><A HREF="action.htm#BlackGunn">BLACK GUNN</A></B> 
   - 1972), takes Melissa away from B.T. and makes her his bitch, giving 
   her daily beatings with a belt while keeping her hooked on crack 
   (Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston can probably really relate to this 
   film!). When Rick finds out about Melissa's predicament, he cuts a 
   deal with Lt. Johnson to help bring down Steadman if he's allowed out 
   of prison. Rick goes on a one man crusade to stop the drug trade and 
   rescue Melissa from her crack whore existence. Can he do it?&nbsp; 
   There's not much in the way of common sense on display here, but

   offensive racial stereotypes, bloody shootouts and hilarious stabs at 
   social significance, not to mention some intentional funny dialogue 
   (When Lt. Johnson looks at Mr. Dockett's dead body, which has just 
   been torn apart with a shotgun blast, he turns to his partner and 
   says, &quot;We're going to have to start paying these teachers more 
   money!&quot;) and overblown drug references, it's hard not to enjoy 
   this film, even if most of the time it's for the wrong reasons. This 
   is one of those rare films where the mighty Jim Brown plays a bad guy 
   for a change and he's believable in the role. He's not his usual 
   anti-hero here, but a full-blown nasty-ass scumbag, which is a rarity 
   for Brown. Even though Brown is top-billed, he doesn't show up until 
   the final third of the film (his total screen time is ten minutes, 
   tops), but he makes a big impression. <B><A HREF="crack_house_1989b.htm">CRACK

   plight of the Vietnamese Boat People after the fall of Saigon in 
   1975? Well, here's a film that pretends to care about their hardships 
   while piling-on one sleazy scene after another. The film opens on 
   April 28, 1975, the day all hell broke loose in Saigon. American 
   reporter Nick Vandam (Bruce Baron; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Fireback1983">FIREBACK</A></B> 
   - 1983) hopes to take his Vietnamese girlfriend Mai (Jessie Elmido) 
   back to the States with him, but they become separated at a 
   checkpoint and Nick is forced to leave without her, but he promises 
   to come back and find her. Six years later, Nick is a successful 
   businessman in Brussels, but he can't get the image of Mai's pained 
   expression of being left behind out of his mind. Nick's secretary 
   (Ingrid De Vos) keeps trying to get him in bed, but all he can see is 
   Mai's face, so he keeps turning her down (even when she suddenly 
   appears at his front door and strips completely naked!). A couple of 
   weeks earlier, Nick received a letter from Mai postmarked from 
   Thailand, where she professes that she still loves him (Which brings 
   up the film's biggest unanswered question: Why has Nick waited six 
   years to search for Mai?). Nick decides to fly to Thailand to look 
   for Mai with only the letter as his guide. The only clue he<A HREF="cruel_horizon_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cruel horizon vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="165" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   has is that she is headed somewhere in south Thailand and when Nick 
   arrives in Bangkok, he is appalled to discover how many young 
   Vietnamese women are abused as sexual playthings by foreign tourists. 
   Nick hires a guide named Sarapong (Louis Kee) to drive him to south 
   Thailand and so the adventure begins. Meanwhile, Mai is on an 
   overcrowded boat on her way to south Thailand, where she must barter 
   for basic necessities like water and food. Sarapong takes Nick to a 
   yacht owned by Nick's old war buddy Mike Forrester (Francois 
   Beukelaers) to help him look for Mai, but Nick soon discovers that 
   Mike is nothing but a profiteer, a common sea pirate. Nick also finds 
   out that searching for a lost love in these territories is a 
   dangerous undertaking, as Mike takes him to refugee camps looking for 
   Mai (while Mike takes care of some illegal business of his own) and 
   discovers the rancid, putrid conditions the refugees must survive 
   daily, including constant pirate attacks. Speaking of pirate attacks; 
   Mai's boat is boarded by a band of Thai sea thieves (this is after 
   Mai has to suffer the indignity of shaving some fat Vietnamese 
   broad's armpits and then is forced into a lesbian encounter with her, 
   just so she can have some food and water), where they shoot and stab 
   the men, toss the ugly women overboard to drown, cut off one child's 
   head (and toss another young kid in the water, where the pirates use 
   him for target practice!) and kidnap the young women (including Mai) 
   to rape, abuse and sell into prostitution. Can Nick reform Mike to 
   care about all the inhumanity going on around him and rescue Mai? 
   Will he find true love before Mai's soul, as well as her body, is 
   destroyed beyond all recognition?&nbsp; While the first thirty 
   minutes of <B>CRUEL HORIZON</B> is relatively bloodless and 
   violence-free, the remainder of the film will throw the viewer for a 
   loop with its bloody killings of men, women and children; nudity that 
   stretches the boundaries of good taste; and a mass rape sequence on a 
   beach where the pirates rip the clothes off their captives and 
   sexually assault them, blindly killing those who put up a fight (When 
   one refugee tries to defend his grandmother, he gets a machete 
   planted in his neck for his troubles!). Director/producer Guy Lee 
   Thys (<B><A HREF="pencil_murders_1982.htm">THE PENCIL MURDERS</A></B> 
   - 1982), who co-wrote the screenplay with Leon Lemahieu, tosses-in so 
   many scenes of human suffering and degradation, as well as unusual 
   sights (including a dwarf brothel owner and what looks like the 
   actual burning of a real human corpse), it's hard to believe that 
   this film could actually be taken as a serious statement about the 
   plight of the Boat People. Believe me, this Belgium/Philippines 
   co-production is sleazy exploitation for the majority of its running 
   time, with bloody castrations, face burnings, pissing on people, 
   trips to whorehouses even hardcore pedophiles would think twice about 
   visiting, and tons of nudity, but very little of it (besides Nick's 
   secretary) titillating. This is one of the largest roles of Bruce 
   Baron's career (he spent the majority of the 80's appearing in 
   Godfrey Ho/Joseph Lai's cut-and-paste ninja flicks), although he 
   spends most of his screen time asking people, &quot;Are you 
   Vietnamese?&quot; (It would make a good drinking game). This film is 
   an emotional downer, but if you like your sleaze cut thick and tasty, 
   give it a try. Joonee Gamboa (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#W1983">W</A></B>

   1978), a normal looking teen with a blonde shag haircut, who happens 
   to be a member of a street gang called The Silks. When Cat isn't 
   spray-painting his name on every overpass or building wall he can 
   find, he's cruising with his gang, which includes gang leader Punch 
   (Derrel Maury; <B><A HREF="massacre_at_central_high_1976.htm">MASSACRE
    AT CENTRAL HIGH</A></B> - 1976), Marble (Meegan King; <B><A HREF="humanoids_from_the_deep_1980.htm">HUMANOIDS
    FROM THE DEEP</A></B> - 1980) and Bumps (Don Carter), looking for 
   chicks, getting drunk and beating up the members of rival gang Los 
   Raidos, a Mexican gang who constantly cross into their turf. Even 
   though they are somewhat young, The Silks act like they own the town, 
   walking into any store and taking what they want without paying. Cat 
   is extremely touchy on the subject of his older brother, Joey (Steve 
   Bond; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Prey 1980">THE PREY</A></B> - 
   1980), a member of The Silks who is now in prison for murder. Punch 
   belittles Cat every chance he gets and Cat is growing tired of it, so 
   when Los Raidos ambush their car, Cat shoots and kills Punch and 
   makes it look like the Mexicans were responsible. Cat takes over 
   leadership duties of The Silks, but police Detective Harder (Rhodes 
   Reason), who has had many run-ins with both Cat and Joey, doesn't 
   believe Cat's version of Punch's death. Cat's first order of business 
   as leader is to put out hits on the leaders of their Mexican rivals, 
   so he sends two of his members to stab them in the shower of their 
   high school gym, which they do, but they are spotted by the football 
   coach (John Ashton; <B><A HREF="beverly_hills_cop_1984.htm">BEVERLY 
   HILLS COP</A></B> - 1984) and Detective Harder brings the Coach to 
   The Silk's high school to identify the stabbers when one of the 
   Mexicans dies of their wounds. Cat, who is a very insecure and 
   ineffectual leader, begins to make some very bad decisions (such as 
   pissing-off a Black drug gang and terrorizing one of his teachers and 
   her wheelchair-bound mother at their home), leading The Silks into a 
   deadly downward spiral. When everyone finally realizes what a chicken 
   shit Cat is (he even tries to rape Joey's wife, but fails miserably), 
   Cat loses leadership of The Silks and then resorts to murder to get 
   even. When he discovers what Cat has done, a recently paroled Joey, 
   the Los Raidos gang and Detective Harder teach Cat and The Silks a 
   lesson they will never forget. A deadly lesson.&nbsp; There's really 
   not much to recommend here, especially David Kyle as Cat, who carries 
   90% of this film, but he's such a bad actor, the only thing he's is 
   really capable of carrying is my groceries to my car. His acting 
   ability is severely wanting, which makes his role as leader of a gang 
   about as believable as Liberace in a role as a lady's man. Director 
   John Bushelman (the editor of <B><A HREF="dinosaurus_1960.htm">DINOSAURUS!</A></B> 
   [1960] and the director of <B><A HREF="day_of_the_nightmare_1965.htm">DAY
    OF THE NIGHTMARE</A></B> [1965]), working with a screenplay by 
   producer William C. Thomas, offers one of the most unrealistic 
   portrayals of L.A. gang life in 70's film history. The Silks are one 
   of the most whitebread street gangs I have ever seen and are about as 
   threatening as my toothless grandmother holding a butter knife. The 
   violence is mild for an R-rated film (even when Los Raidos crash a 
   house party thrown by The Silks, it's bloodless) and, while there is 
   some female nudity, the majority of bare flesh is of the male 
   variety, which is good for gays, not good for everyone else. I can't 
   honestly understand what director Bushelman was aiming for here. It 
   fails horribly as a gang drama (Although I loved the boxes marked 
   &quot;TV Set&quot; that Cat and The Silks steal from a warehouse in 
   the finale. No brand names, just &quot;TV Set&quot;!) and lacks the 
   basic elements for a good exploitation film. The circular ending 
   tries to be meaningful (A traitorous Bumps, who killed Cat, sends his 
   condolences to Cat's mother at his funeral, just as Cat did to 
   Punch's mother at his funeral, with the same results), but it only 
   comes off as forced and, at 104 minutes, <B><A HREF="cruisin_high_1975c.htm">CRUISIN'

    up with aphrodisiacs and drains them of their blood while they are 
   having sex. The doctor then drinks the blood to keep himself 
   eternally young. But wait, that&#146;s not all! Let&#146;s not forget 
   about the doc&#146;s robot assistants, who were previous victims of 
   the doctor&#146;s botched experiments. They are now mindless deformed 
   creatures (who resemble a scarred Zippy the Pinhead with a flashing 
   light in the middle of the forehead!) who kidnap victims for the 
   doctor&#146;s sexual experiments. One robot even plays guitar to get 
   a captive woman in the mood for sex! But wait, there&#146;s more! The 
   curious doc has a living disembodied brain in his laboratory that 
   talks to him! It is the brain of Dr. Humpp&#146;s mentor and it yells 
   orders at Humpp at every opportunity possible. (Let&#146;s not get 
   into the scientific possibitities on how a disembodied brain can 
   speak. There&#146;s not enough space!) There is also a reporter 
   (Ricardo Bauleo) who gets involved in the kidnapping cases only to be 
   snatched by Dr. Humpp&#146;s robots. He is set free by a young woman 
   (Gloria Prat) and they must try to stop Dr. Humpp before more 
   innocent sexual lives are lost. Much more insanity goes on in this 
   film, but I will leave it up to you, the viewer, to experience. 
   Needless to say, Dr. Humpp, the brain and the robots all meet a 
   fitting end.This black and white Argentine-made film, originally 
   titled <B><A HREF="la venganza del sexo.htm">La Venganza del Sexo</A></B> 
   (&quot;Sexual Vengeance&quot;), was quite daring for it&#146;s time 
   (and still is today), with full frontal nudity and near-pornographic 
   sex. The nudity is frequent, even if the women have big hairy bushes 
   and visible vericose veins! Lesbian, straight and oral sex are also 
   featured quite often. The gore is kept to a minimum (this is 1967) 
   but there are shots of homemade brain surgery and decapitated heads 
   hanging in a closet. The film also contains some hilarious dialogue 
   as when Dr. Humpp pronounces, &quot;Sex dominates the world......and 
   now I dominate sex!&quot;, after hooking the reporter and a girl to a 
   sex machine. No other film in recent memory contains as much sheer 
   lunacy as this one. Not released in the U.S. until 1970, I&#146;m 
   surprised it didn&#146;t cause an uproar when screened. The 
   Americanized version, with soft-X sex scenes added by distributor 
   Jerald Intrator (who will get a future profile in this zine), 
   embellishes the plot somewhat from the original film, adding the 
   hilarious dubbed dialogue that spews out of the actors&#146; mouths. 
   The added footage is easy to spot, as it was filmed with different 
   stock and populated with American porn stars of the day (including 
   Kim Pope). I&#146;m also surprised that more hasn&#146;t been written 
   about this forgotten gem. This is a cult classic waiting to be 
   rediscovered. Directed by&nbsp; Emilio Vieyra, who also made the

    OF THE ALPHA STONE</A><A NAME="Curse Alpha Stone"></A> (1972) -</B> 
   After a brief audio history on the ancient art of alchemy, this 
   obscure early 70's exploitation flick opens up with Professor Abe 
   Adams (Jim Scotlin) making love to his girlfriend while a piano 
   concerto plays in the background. After some slow-motion sex, 
   Professor Adams continues his experiments in creating the 
   Philosopher's Stone, an object that gives it's creator untold power. 
   He's very close to finding the secret when some of his students steal 
   his research papers and copy them. When the Dean gets his hands on 
   his papers, he comes up with a way to win back his uptight wife (porn 
   star Sandy Carey), who happens to be Professor Adams' <A HREF="curse_of_the_alpha_stone_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/curse of the alpha stone dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>landlady.
    Adams creates the Philosopher's Stone (after donning some magical 
   jewelry and chanting, &quot;Science and mysticism can be 
   merged!&quot;) and he uses pieces of the light-and-smoke-emitting 
   stone to create a powder, which he mixes with wine and gives to a 
   Black homosexual guy to drink (he thinks he's going to get high!). He 
   ends up turning straight, steals a female mannequin and makes love to 
   it (!) and then goes out and rapes a series of women. He goes to a 
   psychiatrist, who hypnotises him, where we find out that he has 
   become possessed by an eternal being called Alpha and is cured of his 
   homosexuality (does the Christian Right know about this?). This 
   upsets his fat White boyfriend who says, &quot;What's the matter with 
   you bitch? There's something queer going on around here and I'm going 
   to find out what it is!&quot; Meanwhile, Professor Adams cooks up 
   another batch of powder and it's effects start affecting the 
   occupants of the apartment house (the maid becomes so horny, smoke 
   comes shooting out between her legs!). The whole apartment complex 
   comes down with sex fever and the females visit Dr. Adams to have sex 
   with him, including his landlady, who turns from dowdy to sexbomb in 
   no time at all. It all ends rather suddenly as the Black homosexual 
   breaks into the Professor's apartment, grabs the stone and there a 
   huge puff of smoke. We then see the landlady walking down the street 
   dressed in her sexy clothes. THE END (?). The outrageous storyline to 
   this little-seen flick is almost enough to make this worthwhile 
   viewing. Almost. There are too many loose threads when the film ends, 
   as the Dean's plan is never explained and the students stealing the 
   Professor's notes leads nowhere. Those two plot points are the reason 
   why I felt cheated when it ended. So much could have been done with 
   them. There's plentiful nudity (including a nice turn by porn star 
   Sandy Carey as the frigid landlady) and all the women look good 
   undressed (no silicon here, folks). The real problem is that the 
   acting is abhorrent, the pacing slow and one-time director Stewart 
   Malleon treats rape as a recreational activity rather than a crime 
   (as did most porn features of this period). As a matter of fact, this 
   film looks like a porn movie without the graphic sex. There's also 
   very little violence, just some bleeding from the eye and a death by 
   rape in the finale. Sometimes films are obscure for a reason. Also 
   starring Lowell Smith, Olivia Enke and Caroline Ronchetti. Jeffrey C.

   universe (it's very loosely based on the Cinderella fairy tale). 
   Syreena (Trina Parks) and her band of colorfully-dressed female 
   bikers ride around in tricked-out three-wheeled choppers and get into 
   a bunch of adventures. They're hassled by Marines (Syreena and her 
   girls throw lemon meringue pies in their faces and kick them in the 
   nuts while the USMC song plays in the background), the police (who 
   drive around in a patrol car with the biggest flashing red light on 
   the car's roof that you will ever see) routinely stop and frisk them

   founder of the Cross Foundation, who says in a speech to black 
   reporters, &quot;I intend to see that those who gave it to me, get it

   mother's disappearance and learns that several prominent black males 
   are also missing. Syreena learns (from someone dressed like Aunt 
   Jemima!) that her mother was running an abortion clinic before she 
   went missing. Syreena is then captured by the KKK and brought to 
   Commander Cross' mansion, where she is forced to watch a minstrel 
   show (Where she has to listen to cringe-worthy jokes as: &quot;What's 
   the first half of a word that comes out of every black baby's mouth?

   attempting to clone all the black leaders he has kidnapped and use 
   the clones to further his political career. Syreena finds her Mom in

    Filled with too many visual and audio gags to catch in one viewing, 
   you'll have to watch this at least three times to take it all in. For 
   a film that is rated PG, this film contains many jokes that would be 
   found offensive today (if Al Sharpton ever finds out this was 
   directed and written by white men, he would surely lead a boycott to 
   remove this film from circulation), from a tasteless hanging gag in a 
   jailhouse; the cops' &quot;Nigger Alarm&quot; that sounds off every

    DAPHNE'S REVENGE</A><A NAME="Deadly Daphne"></A> (1980) -</B> What a 
   total heap of stinking trash. This lousy rape/revenge exploitation 
   flick is about four men who pick up hitch-hiker Cindy (Laurie Tait 
   Partridge) in their RV. They stop at a secluded hunting lodge where 
   Charlie, the raving <A HREF="deadly_daphnes_revenge_1980.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/deadly daphne's revenge dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="162" HEIGHT="231" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>racist
    of the group, rapes her. After the rape she runs into the woods and 
   the four men continue on their trip.&nbsp; Cindy goes to the D.A. to 
   bring a case against Charlie, but he convinces her to file charges 
   against all four men. All four are arrested on rape charges and 
   released on bail. The three innocent men slowly see their reputations 
   and businesses go down the crapper thanks to the false charges and 
   Bruce (the nerd of the bunch) commits suicide after his wife files 
   for divorce and he loses a huge insurance contract. Steve (who is 
   Charlie's half-brother) loses his coaching job at his school. The 
   final man, Bobo, works at Charlie's business and does whatever 
   Charlie says, even though his wife leaves him and won't let him see 
   his kids. Charlie hires some Mob muscle to kill Cindy, not knowing 
   that Cindy has dropped her suit (she feels guilty about Bruce's 
   suicide and actually likes Steve). Charlie's lawyer tells him that if 
   anything happens to Cindy, the police will know it was him, so he 
   tries to stop the hit but is told by the Mob that it's too late to 
   call it off. Charlie talks Steve into taking Cindy back to the 
   hunting lodge to hide out until he can find the hit man and call it 
   off, but an escaped female mental patient from Charlie's past (the 
   Daphne in the title) manages to throw a monkey wrench into the 
   proceedings. Piss-poor on every level, this film (also known as <B>BACKLASH</B> 
   and <B>THE HUNTING SEASON</B>) tries to portray our justice system as 
   a flawed mess (which it is) and the people who hold the power as 
   vindictive (which they are), but does it in such a half-assed manner 
   that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief. The film looks 
   like it was edited by someone with ADS as it jumps from 
   scene-to-scene in mid-sentence and various shots fail to match in the 
   same scene. Charlie is such a raving racist (isn't it interesting 
   that &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;rapist&quot; only differ by one 
   letter?), spouting rants about Jews, Blacks, Polish and the Spanish 
   (he even shoots a helpless dog!), that it's hard to believe he's the 
   owner of a successful business and the most powerful person in this 
   film. One-time director Richard Gardner, who also portrays on of the 
   four men, gives this film a 70's TV movie look. If it weren't for the 
   nudity on view in the beginning and some foul language, it could very 
   well pass for one. A bad one. Leave it to Troma to dig up some 
   obscure piece of crap, retitle it and try to pass it off as something 
   new and exciting. It's their specialty. Don't fall for it. Troma 
   lists this as a 1987 production, but by the looks of the hair styles, 
   clothing and automobiles, it had to have been made at least several 
   years earlier. Also starring Anthony Holt, John Suttle, Alan Levy and 
   a rail-thin James Avery in an early role. A <A HREF="http://www.troma.com">Troma

   chained beneath the sea since 1850 and when Jock removes an amulet 
   from around her black-tressed skeleton she returns to life. Jock 
   wears the amulet, against his native helper's protest. Soon he begins

   that once the Deathhead Virgin is revived, seven virgins must be 
   ritually sacrificed to appease her for wrongs done to her in the 
   previous century. Jock has been appointed to carry out the deed.

   begins to notice that Jock is not himself. After witnessing (and

    KILLED MARY WHAT'S 'ER NAME?</A></B>, a likable mystery with a 
   winning performance by the late Red Buttons. Buttons portrays Mickey, 
   a wise-cracking diabetic ex-boxer, who for some reason takes an 
   interest in the murder of a prostitute named Mary Di Napoli. He rents 
   Mary's run-down NYC motel room and begins an investigation into her 
   death. People don't take too kindly to his questions. He asks 
   apartment dweller Malthus (Dick Anthony Williams) if he knows who 
   killed Mary and he says, &quot;Sin. Just like most people.&quot; 
   Mickey saves aging prostitute Christine (Sylvia Miles) from two goons 
   who rob her and begins a plutonic relationship with her, which she 
   wishes was more (He says to her, &quot;You don't want me. I'm a 
   eunich.&quot;), but also helps him track down Alex (a young Sam 
   Waterston), a photographer who is doing a documentary on prostitutes. 
   Mickey's daughter Della (Alex Playten) and old friend Val (Conrad 
   Bain) also help Mickey in tracking down Mary's killer. Things turn 
   deadly as the film Alex was shooting may have something to do with 
   Mary's death and people who Mickey knows end up dead in the process, 
   while Della and Alex begin a romantic relationship. What does bigwig 
   stock-broker Boulting (David Doyle) have to do with Mary's death? As 
   Mickey investigate further, we begin to understand why Mickey is so 
   interested in Mary's death. Director Ernest Pintoff (here credited as 
   &quot;Ernie Pintoff&quot;), who directed a lot of episodic TV in the 
   70's and 80's, as well as films such as <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Blade1972">BLADE</A></B> 
   (1972) and <B><A HREF="jaguar_lives_1979.htm">JAGUAR LIVES</A></B> 
   (1979), gives us a good sense of what is must of been like to live in 
   New York City's Times Square during the 70's, as the atmosphere is 
   dirty, grimy and, mostly, unpleasant. Red Button is a marvel here, 
   playing a tough man with a debilitating disease, who loves his 
   daughter and is relentless in his pursuits. There are also 
   appearances by the late Ron Carey and Jake LaMotta as bartenders. 
   This is a tight little mystery of a bygone era when New York was full 
   of working girls, the cops didn't care and crime ran rampant. The 
   only difference today is that it's cleaner. Search this one out. A <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Video Gems">Video

   often than you think. The vetting process for reality shows needs to 
   be done better, so people don't end up killing themselves once they 
   are off-camera. Only a very few reality &quot;stars&quot; have made a 
   living in show business after their reality show face-time was 
   over.). In this film, Death Row inmates and other convicts appear on 
   a game show called &quot;Live Or Die&quot;, moderated by the 
   perpetually happy (at least on-screen) host Chuck Toedan (Pirro 
   regular John McCafferty) and his female assistant Shanna Shallow 
   (Debra Lamb; <B><A HREF="invisible_maniac_1990.htm">THE INVISIBLE MANIAC</A></B> 
   - 1990), where they are given a chance for a pardon or death, 
   depending if they can answer questions correctly (the show is skewed 
   so that the convicts die, because that is what the audience wants). 
   Chuck starts out the latest episode of the show telling the audience 
   that they ran out of time yesterday (the one thing that this movie 
   get right is that a week's worth of shows is shot in a day or two, 
   which is why you may see the same audience members from a show you 
   watched yesterday) and Convict 9372 (who has his head in a 
   guillotine) has yet to have &quot;final judgment&quot; passed on him. 
   Chuck asks the prisoner how he feels (&quot;I'm feeling a little 
   nervous, Chuck.&quot;), because if he answers the next question 
   wrong, he will lose his head (we see his family in the audience 
   rooting for him). His question is, &quot;What is the name of this 
   famous movie (watch the monitor)?&quot; It's footage of a mummy 
   missing getting his hands on a bikini-clad girl and the mummy says 
   &quot;Motherfucking son-of-a-bitch!&quot; over and over. For an 
   instant reprieve, Convict 9372 has to name the title, but he can't 
   (in a funny bit, the name of the films happens to be&nbsp; 
   &quot;Curses Of The Mummy&quot;), but before they cut off his head, 
   he has a chance to win his family members $10,000. If his severed 
   head falls in the basket face-up, his family will get the money (One 
   of his kids says, &quot;C'mon Dad, you can do it!&quot;). If it ends 
   up face-down, the family gets nothing. A smiling Chuck pulls the cord 
   on the guillotine and the convict's head is cut off. Some judges come 
   to look in the basket and Chuck gives the thumbs-up. His family has 
   won the money and start screaming for joy in the audience (Gorehounds 
   will be disappointed, because there is absolutely no blood or gore in 
   this film; we don't even get to see the convict lose his head and 
   there is no blood on the guillotine. The movie is played strictly for 
   laughs.). After the opening credits roll (Pirro wrote the New 
   Wave-like title song), we see a bunch of women, headed by the aptly 
   named Gloria Sternvirgin (Robyn Blythe), protesting the show outside 
   the studio, holding signs that say &quot;Fuck Chuck&quot;, &quot;Chuck
    Sucks&quot;, &quot;Only God Can Kill&quot; and my favorite, 
   &quot;Chuck Should Be Aborted&quot; (talk about your mixed 
   messages!). Chuck comes outside the studio with some guards, gets 
   into his sporty convertible and says, &quot;See you tomorrow 
   ladies!&quot; (There's another funny scene where Chuck stops at a 
   crosswalk where there is a sign that says &quot;Slow Children&quot; 
   and we see a bunch of kids walking in slow motion across the 
   crosswalk. Cheap, but funny.). Chuck gets verbally assaulted by a man 
   in the car next to him while they are stopped at a red light and 
   Chuck raises his driver side window, where it says &quot;Blow it out 
   your ass&quot; and he drives off. Chuck's life outside the studio is 
   anything but cheerful, Besides the problems with Miss Sternvirgin and 
   her group, Chuck always has the same crazy loon beg him to let him be 
   on the show when he shows up at the studio every morning, Chuck finds 
   a naked woman in his bed and she is willing to have sex with him if 
   he can get her convict boyfriend on the game show and he is always 
   verbally and physically attacked by complete strangers and criminals 
   that want a chance to be in his show so they can win their freedom 
   (not realizing that the show is rigged against the criminals). Chuck 
   has also run afoul of hitman Luigi Pappalardo (Beano; <B><A HREF="house_of_the_wolfman_2009.htm">HOUSE
    OF THE WOLF MAN</A></B> - 2009), who wants Chuck dead because of 
   what happened on a past show. Chuck had mob kingpin Don Guido Spumoni 
   (Mark Lasky), known on the show as Convict 9899, strapped to a chair 
   with an electrode attached to his penis (or as Chuck calls it, his 
   &quot;wang-dang-doodle&quot;!) and Chuck tells Don Spumoni that 
   Shanna is about to come out and perform &quot;The Dance Of A Thousand 
   Boners&quot; and if he gets and erection or any movement on his 
   penis, he will be shocked with 50,000 volts of electricity and die. 
   Shanna comes out and does her sexy dance, exposing her breasts at the 
   end, but Don Spumoni makes it through the dance without a single 
   movement from his penis. Turns out Don Spumoni was gay and when Chuck 
   congratulates him for making it through the dance and touches him on 
   the shoulder, Don Spumoni gets a boner and is electrocuted (it's a 
   pretty funny concept). Luigi Pappalardo (who was a good friend of Don 
   Spumoni) was hired by Spumoni's organization to kill Chuck, so Chuck 
   is dodging Pappalardo the best he can. Back to the present, Chuck is 
   back on his show and asks Convict 1768 (who was raped in prison the 
   night before and has to stand; one of the film's low points) whether 
   he wants what is in the the envelope that Chuck is holding or what is 
   behind the curtain Shanna is standing next to. He picks the curtain 
   and Chuck shows Convict 1768 that the envelope contained a stay of 
   execution, so what is behind the curtain cannot be good at all. As 
   the curtain opens, we see a noose with a box beneath it. The convict 
   is hooded and hanged on-air (we don't get to see it, though). It 
   seems that the popularity of Chuck's show has spread to other media, 
   especially TV commercials as, in one such commercial, Convict 2811 
   tastes two versions of cheese spreads. Turns out that one of them is 
   a new cheese-flavored rat poison and the convict dies. Chuck is then 
   on a popular talk show, where he is ripped into by Miss Sternvirgin, 
   but phone-in audience members all seem to support Chuck, which 
   pisses-off Miss Sternvirgin and she cuts Chuck a new asshole. Chuck 
   calls her a &quot;stupid bitch&quot; live on-air (and then asks the 
   host, &quot;Can I say stupid?&quot;). The last call on the show is 
   from Pappalardo, who says Chuck is a dead man. After the talk show is 
   over, Chuck pulls Miss Sternvirgin into his convertible, as he runs 
   over two masked men carrying guns. When Chuck explains to her what is 
   happening in his life, it's apparent that there is some romantic heat 
   between the two. Chuck has a nightmare (complete with opening and 
   closing credits!) featuring him, a naked Sternvirgin and Don Guido 
   Spumoni, who threatens to kill Chuck, while Chuck changes appearance 
   throughout the nightmare (you should see him as a toothless 
   hillbilly!). It ends with a zoned-out Chuck saying, &quot;I'm afraid 
   of no one!&quot; (which is repeated after the closing credits and the 
   film ends), while the announcer of the nightmare tells us &quot;This 
   is the end of the dream&quot;. Pappalardo agrees to meet Chuck and 
   Miss Sternvirgin at his studio office to call of the hit, as long as 
   he can bring his mother, Mama Pappalardo (Mark Lasky again, who is 
   hilarious), with him and Chuck can get her tickets to the taping of 
   her favorite show, which shoots in the same studio lot as Chuck's 
   show. While Mamma Pappalardo is given the tickets to the show by 
   Chuck's secretary Trudy (Darwyn Carson; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Rapture">THE
    RAPTURE</A></B> - 1991) and she points the old lady to the direction 
   of the studio, Luigi Pappalardo (who calls off the hit) thinks that 
   Miss Sternvirgin is romantically interested in him and takes her out 
   for a &quot;romantic&quot; lunch. Things go from bad to worse when 
   Mamma Pappalardo (who Chuck has never met) needs to go to the 
   bathroom and gets lost, ending up as a contestant on Chuck's show 
   (The Stage Manager warns Chuck that they don't have the proper 
   release papers for her, but Chuck says this isn't the first time it 
   has happened and not to worry about it.). Her &quot;Live Or Die&quot; 
   task is to carry two cans of gas through a fiery obstacle course 
   outside. If she makes it to the end, she will be granted a pardon. 
   The hunched-over Mamma Pappalardo makes it through the obstacle 
   course (she has to jump through hoops set on fire!) and sets the gas 
   cans in a makeshift table with lit candles on it at the end of the 
   course. The table collapses and the candles ingnite the gasoline, 
   blowing Mamma Pappalardo to bits. The rest of the film finds Chuck 
   trying to avoid Luigi when Trudy notifies him that he just blew-up 
   Mamma Pappalardo. Luigi thinks that Miss Sternvirgin has accepted his 
   proposal of marriage (you wouldn't marry him if you saw the <A HREF="deathrow_gameshow_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/deathrow gameshow ad mat8a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>way
    he eats!). Chuck tries to hide the old lady's death and solve Miss 
   Sternvirgin's problem, but like everything else in Chuck's life, 
   things don't go as planned. Luigi watches a tape of his mother being 
   blown-up and wants Chuck dead more than ever, but Chuck pulls some 
   strings and Luigi ends up as Convict 8981 on his show, where he has 
   to spell &quot;I Want To Live&quot; with child's wooden alphabet 
   blocks in a soundproof and airtight room in less than a minute. He 
   has to spell it before all the oxygen is pumped out of the chamber 
   (Luigi actually does it, but Chuck kicks the chamber and knocks the 
   blocks down!). All the oxygen is now out of the chamber and Luigi is 
   dead. Chuck thinks he is in the clear, but Luigi was merely knocked 
   out and wakes up in a room full of the corpses of previous convicts 
   on the show. Chuck wants to quit doing the show, but his manager 
   convinces him to do one more. Miss Sternvirgin hears the conversation 
   through the door and then locks a very angry Luigi in a janitor's 
   closet. A janitor lets Luigi out of the closet and, during the taping 
   of the last show, he makes Chuck and Miss Sternvirgin get into the 
   airproof booth and they are rapidly running out of air, but the crazy 
   loon that begs Chuck to be on his show every morning shoots and kills 
   Luigi (I guess he is now qualified to be a contestant on the show!) 
   and Chuck and Miss Sternvirgin are saved. They become a loving couple 
   and Chuck does, indeed, quit the game show, as we see during the end 
   credits that he is now doing TV commercials for all types of 
   products, using the corpses from his old game show as demonstration 
   dummies. I guess love is blind, as well as stupid.&nbsp; Considering 
   the subject matter, I was surprised to find that there is not one 
   drop of blood spilled during the entire film, but thankfully it is 
   full of topless nudity to keep you occupied though all the bad and

   having a good time (the acting is good for a film this cheap) and

    SCHOOLGIRLS</A><A NAME="Delinquent School"></A> (1974) -</B> Crazy 
   exploitation film where three loony inmates escape from the state 
   mental asylum for the criminally insane and invade the Oxford 
   Corrective Institute for Young Women, where the girls are crazier 
   than the escapees. The stern principal of the institute, Dr. Baxter 
   (John Alderman), is making a dozen girls stay at the institute during 
   the holiday vacation as punishment, as most of them are sex-crazy 
   nymphets who get into trouble at the drop of a bra. Before the insane 
   trio hit the institute, they invade the home of impotent farmer Earl 
   (the late <A HREF="george buck flower.htm">George 'Buck' Flower</A>, 
   sporting a funny pair of false teeth) and his nympho wife Ellie 
   (Julie Gant). Carl (Michael Pataki) is the leader of the trio and a 
   celebrity impersonator/rapist. He and Bruce (Stephen Stucker), a 
   homosexual deviant, entertain Earl by playing songs on the piano and 
   getting him drunk, while burly Dick Peters (Bob Minor, in a rare 
   leading role) rapes the willing Ellie. The nutso trio<A HREF="delinquent_schoolgirls_1975b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/delinquent school girls vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="138" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   then go to the institute, where they raid the kitchen and rape a 
   couple of female cooks (they end up to be willing, of course). After 
   imprisoning the two girls in a freezer (with an ingenious timelock 
   made of ice blocks), the trio explore the school, where they find an 
   elderly teacher (and his snakes) about to have sex with a hypnotized 
   student (Dick ends up with the snakes dumped on him by the teacher 
   before he has a heart attack), two pot-smoking girls at the pool who 
   get Carl and Dick stoned (and Carl nearly drowns) and Dick is is 
   attacked by by two girls playing croquet. Carl, as punishment, makes 
   the two girls slap and punch each other until one is unconscious. 
   They then go to the gymnasium, where a karate class is taking place. 
   Carl makes all the girls dance like the Rockettes and Dick gets beat 
   up again, this time by Greta (porn vet Sharon Kelly), when he tries 
   to take her panties off. Dick and Carl then get the shit kicked out 
   of them by the girls, while Bruce is manhandled (and liking it) by 
   the male karate instructor. The police arrive and cart the trio away 
   and they are glad to be going back to the safety of the asylum (I 
   prefer to disregard the tacky end scrawl that states they escaped 
   from police custody and are now at large). Director Gregory Corarito (<B><A HREF="wanda_the_sadistic_hypnotist_1969.htm">WANDA,
    THE SADISTIC HYPNOTIST</A></B> - 1969) fills the screen with so many 
   shots of naked female flesh (including the legendary slow-motion shot 
   of Roberta Pedon's breasts breaking free of her skimpy shirt while 
   doing jumping jacks), you almost forget how ridiculous the entire 
   film really is. The screenplay (by Corarito, producer Maurice Smith 
   and executive producer John Lamb) seems to be implying that the three 
   escapees may not be the worst people in this film. They may be crazy, 
   but at least they have an excuse. There's the elderly male teacher 
   (Ralph Campbell) who hypnotizes a student so he can have sex with 
   her; Dr. Baxter, who pretends to be a prude, but is actually having 
   an affair with one of the teachers and has daydreams of the girls 
   naked; some good samaritans in a van, who pick up one of the girls 
   escaping the trio, only to have them turn out to be rapists; and the 
   girls themselves, who revel in sex and drugs. In the end, it's the 
   crazy trio who end up being the worse for wear. They commit no 
   violence (even though Carl threatens violence, but seems incapable of 
   committing it) but, instead, take the brunt of the punishment from 
   the girls. Genre vet Michael Pataki (<B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Grave Vampire">GRAVE
    OF THE VAMPIRE</A></B> - 1972) overacts shamelessly, as he imitates 
   Richard Burton, W.C. Fields, Richard Nixon and countless other

   passing away from AIDS in 1986) and Bob Minor (who is an excellent 
   stuntman and character actor, appearing in over 200 films since 1970) 
   sets Blacks back fifty years as a muscular rapist who doesn't see a 
   white woman he doesn't want to fuck. The violence in this film is 
   miniscule (mainly consisting of Dick getting beat up) and there's no 
   blood at all, just plenty of tits and ass (but no bush). This is 
   definitely a product of the sleazy 70's, where rape is considered a 
   joke and there are absolutely no consequences for committing it. A 
   real curio. A lot of reviewers seem to think that this film is a 
   mean-spirited misogynist's dream, which make me wonder if they really

   nerve to take co-directing and co-producing credit! The story is 
   this: Four thieves (two men, two women) escape the city after just 
   pulling a big diamond heist. When their jeep runs out of gas in the 
   middle of nowhere, they travel by foot through the backwoods until 
   they come upon the shack of moonshiner Harlan (George Ellis of <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Demon Hunter">DEMON
    HUNTER</A></B> - 1965) and his new young wife Reba Sue (Ashley 
   Brookes). It's not long before a clash of cultures ensues, which have 
   deadly consequences. It's hard to figure out who is worse here: 
   Harlan, who spouts scripture, accuses his wife of being a whore (yet 
   is incapable of making love to her) but has no problem ogling the two 
   city women or the town's Black whore while drinking himself into a 
   blind stupor; or Kirk, the thief who watches Reba Sue undress and has 
   no problem smacking women around and raping them (although Reba Sue 
   ends up liking it) to satisfy his urges. With their cover blown 
   (thanks to a radio broadcast), the thieves take Harlan, Reba Sue and 
   retarded helper Toby hostage and a series of unfortunate events 
   happen (including the death of one of the female thieves) which 
   culminates in Harlan getting some bloody revenge, which includes some 
   pitchfork, bear trap and gun violence. This slice of early 70's

   frequent female flesh and some off-the-wall one-liners (&quot;Is that

   frequent interruptions by Carradine and new library music tracks (not

    A group of women are on a Nazi train, packed in a car like sardines, 
   headed for a concentration camp (they call it a &quot;prison&quot;, 
   but I think we know better). The film is centered on Tania Nobel 
   (Lina Polito), a young woman, whose only crime was kissing a man who 
   was not a member of the &quot;Aryan Race&quot; (I think we know what 
   they mean). The Nazis take Tania's boyfriend outside, place him 
   against a wall and take his life at the hands of a firing squad, with 
   Tania put on this train for God knows what. Before they get to the 
   camp, two of the women try to escape, only to get gunned down, their 
   dead bodies put back on the train with the women, a reminder that 
   escape is impossible.&nbsp; These women have no idea what they are in

   sexually satisfy Nazi soldiers, some will be tortured or experimented 
   on, all of them will suffer.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   take a shower (the pre-requisite full-frontal nudity scene), have all 
   of the hair on their bodies removed, including pubic hair (shown in 
   loving close-up) and are assigned to blocks. We then meet some of the 
   women, including Angela (Stefania D'Amario; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#City Walking Dead">CITY

   (one of the female prisoners tells Tania to get use to the atrocities 
   that will be performed on her because &quot;We lost the war.&quot;). 
   We then learn that Tania met Herr Erner five years earlier. While she 
   was riding her bike down a country road, Herr Erner spots her, gets 
   off his motorcycle and tried to rape her, but she escaped. She won't 
   have that luxury here. One of the female guards, Greta (Solvi

   causing a jealous Helga to get into a catfight with her (&quot;She's

   but, the next morning, Herr Erner forces Tania to make love to 
   Frederick in front of all the prisoners, humiliating her. When Herr 
   Erner gets Tania alone, he shames her for giving up her virginity to 
   a Polish (Jewish) man, telling her that she will be hanged and he 
   will personally &quot;tighten the noose around your neck.&quot; Tania 
   not only has to put up with Herr Erner and the cruel guards, she also 
   has to deal with lesbian prisoners who want to make her their latest 
   conquest. Tania finally gives in and becomes Mara's girlfriend, but 
   Herr Erner is not done with her, making her, and other female 
   prisoners, to become prostitutes, laughing at her while forcing 
   Angela to perform oral sex on him (&quot;Look at me! You have to

   (Guido Leontini; <B><A HREF="valachi_papers_1972.htm">THE VALACHI PAPERS</A></B>

   with her, knowing full well that Herr Erner is watching and will

    Shit, I can't continue! While I know every director can't make a 
   winner 100% of the time, deciding to write and direct a film like 
   this, with no morals or redeeming social value, is beyond the pale. 
   This is nothing but a misogynist's dream come true, as women are 
   beaten, mistreated, humiliated and put in situations that shouldn't 
   happen to a dog. There is a scene in the film where Helga hits Angela 
   over and over on her head with a baton, turning her scalp into a 
   bloody mess, killing her, all because she refuses to tell her the 
   name of her female lover. When that <A HREF="deported_women_of_the_ss_special_section_italy_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/deported women of the ss special section german poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="189" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>happened,
    it was time to call this film what it really is: Trash. Putrid, 
   odorous trash. John Steiner overacts so badly, you'll want to laugh, 
   but you won't, because of the subject matter. The word &quot;Jew&quot;
    is not uttered once in this film, rather calling them 
   &quot;uncivilized&quot;, &quot;barbaric&quot; and even 
   &quot;Polish&quot;, but you know what they are talking about. Most of 
   these Italian Naziploitation flicks never mention Jews. It's their 
   way of justifying the subject matter, legitimizing torture and the 
   abuse of the fairer sex.&nbsp; That is why I find these films 
   disgusting. While they basically have the same plots as &quot;women 
   in prison&quot; (WIP) films, the swastikas and sights of Nazi regalia 
   remind us that this is nothing but exploiting a period in our history 
   that we should be ashamed of. Using these symbols of hate for 
   entertainment value makes me wanna puke. I'm not Jewish (actually I'm 
   German!), but I can understand when I hear an elderly Jewish person 
   say &quot;never forget.&quot; I can only feel contempt for filmmakers 
   who exploit such a tragic period in our history. I can't help it, 
   that's just the way I am. Di Silvestro tries to justify this film by 
   having Tania shove a razor blade up her hooch, so when Erner rapes 
   her, he is then castrated, bleeding all over the sheets. He calls out 
   to Dobermann to shoot her, but he shoots Erner instead. Tania ends up 
   dead, too. Intelligent people will see this film for what it actually 
   is, a poor exercise in bad taste. I will now get off my soapbox.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   to be having a good time in Greece) calls Police Sgt. Vendris 
   (Fernando Bislani) to report the tourists missing, telling Vendris 
   that this isn't the first time that this has happened, but he blows 
   the good Father off (we saw at the sacrifice that Vendris was there, 
   wearing a blue hooded robe, a suitable color for a policeman!). After 
   Father Roche pulls a small gold idol of a Minotaur out of his desk 
   drawer, he then writes a letter to his good friend Milo Kaye 
   (director Costas Carayiannis, acting under the pseudonym &quot;Costas 
   Skouras&quot;), a private detective in New York City, asking him to 
   come to Greece and solve the cases of the missing tourists. We then 
   see Milo reading the letter, while his girlfriend (Jane Lyle) steps 
   out of the shower and tries to talk Milo out of traveling to Greece 
   (this entire sequence plays with the girlfriend in both full-frontal 
   and topless nudity, which is missing from the PG edit). Back in 
   Greece, Father Roche gets a visit from good friend Beth (the single-monickered
    Gelsomina), an archaeologist who has brought along fellow 
   archaeologists Ian (Nikol Verlel Verlekis) and Tom (Bob Behling) with 
   her. They are here on an archaeological dig, after finding a small 
   gold idol of a Minotaur's head in the ruins nearby (Father Roche 
   takes one look at it and knows that it means trouble). Ian and Tom 
   head out on their own to scout the area where they are going to dig 
   and discover a stone slab on the ground depicting a medieval 
   double-bladed war axe (the same symbol we saw at the entrance of the 
   sacrificial altar in the beginning of the film). They lift the stone 
   slab, finding a secret underground chamber, which they explore, 
   discovering the dead corpses of the two missing tourists (the female 
   corpse is topless and that shot is missing from the PG edit). They 
   then look up to see the stone statue of the Minotaur spewing flames 
   from its nose, while a disembodied voice says, &quot;Those who enter 
   the unopened chamber of the Minotaur must die!&quot; and both Ian and 
   Tom end up missing. Beth meets the suave and obviously rich Baron 
   Corofax as she is walking out of a shop (the shopkeeper's daughter is 
   the young girl who stabbed the two tourists in the sacriface) and she 
   accepts a ride from him to take a look at some ancient artifacts in 
   his mansion, but she becomes creeped-out by the Baron's behavior 
   after a short time there and leaves on foot, only to be captured by 
   some cult members dressed in black-hooded robes. That makes five 
   missing tourists in a matter of a few weeks, so Father Roche phones 
   Milo in desperation (which he should have done in the first place), 
   pleading with him to come to Greece, which Milo does. Father Roche 
   also gets a visit from Beth's older sister Laurie (Luan Peters), who 
   is also searching for her missing sister. The trio begin their 
   investigation, where a few of the people they talk to either end up 
   murdered (one woman they talk to is discovered with a noose around 
   her neck) or retract what they earlier said out of fear. It becomes 
   obvious to the trio that Baron Corofax is behind it all (he doesn't 
   even try to hide his involvement, since his wealth and influence 
   literally lets him get away with murder). After a few close calls, 
   where cult members try to kidnap Laurie a couple of times and the 
   Baron's chauffeur Max (George Velvis) tries to run over Father Roche 
   and Milo (The Father say to Milo, &quot;Did you have to push me so 
   hard?&quot;), both the Father and Milo discover Beth, Ian &amp; Tom's 
   hidden van, where they get behind the wheel and arrive just moments 
   after we witness the shopkeeper's daughter sacrifice Beth and Ian (we 
   see the blades enter their hearts, more scenes missing from the PG 
   edit), but they manage to catch and beat the snot out of a fleeing 
   Sgt. Vendris, who is still wearing his blue robe. At the same time 
   this is happening, several black-robed cult members finally kidnap 
   Laurie from her hotel room and take her to Baron Corofax, who 
   hypnotizes her into believing that this whole nightmare will end if 
   she sacrifices Father Roche (Laurie has a nightmare where she is 
   graphically stabbing the Father, which is also missing from the PG 
   edit). Laurie's will and mind prove a little too strong, though, for 
   the hypnotism to work, so the Baron has to come up with an alternate 
   plan. When Father Roche and Milo go to the Baron's mansion to make 
   him release Laurie in exchange for Sgt. Vendris, the Baron pulls out 
   a shotgun, fires a warning shot and makes our two heroes release 
   Vendris and leave without Laurie. Because Laurie's will is so strong, 
   the Baron decides that she and Tom will be next to die on the 
   Minotaur's altar. Milo shows up and fires a few bullets into some 
   cult members, but they have no effect, so they capture Milo and 
   decide to perform a triple sacrifice. Father Roche enters the 
   sacrificial chamber holding a ruby-encrusted crucifix, speaks in 
   Latin and throws holy water on the statue of the Minotaur, causing it 
   to explode in a million pieces and stopping the Baron himself from 
   plunging a dagger into Laurie's heart. The Baron, as well as the rest 
   of the adult cult members then bloodily explode, too (a major 
   sequence missing from the PG version, finally giving us closure about 
   what really happened to the Baron and his cult, since the PG version 
   suggests the cult members die when the chamber collapses), leaving 
   Laura, Tom, Milo and Father Roche to survive the whole ordeal. The 
   only cult members to survive are the children (including the 
   shopkeeper's daughter), as Father Roche tells Milo he may need his 
   help again in the future when these children turn into adults (Me? I 
   would have hacked all these children to pieces to make sure history 
   doesn't repeat itself, but since Father Roche is a man of the cloth, 
   he has no other choice but to let them leave and walk down the 
   mountain). We watch the children cult members walk down the mountain 
   while a cheezy rock tune called &quot;The Devil's Men&quot; is heard 
   (sung by Paul Williams, yes <U>that</U> Paul Williams, but it sounds 
   nothing like him and it doesn't play over the end credits of the PG 
   version) while the final credits roll. The song keeps playing for two <A HREF="land_of_the_minotaur_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/land of the minotaur poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="171" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>minutes
    after the screen turns black!&nbsp; While nothing earth-shaking, 
   this film, released theatrically and on VHS in the U.S. under the 
   title <B><A HREF="land_of_the_minotaur_1976.htm">LAND OF THE MINOTAUR</A></B>,
    is still a watchable exploitation item. Donald Pleasence seems to be 
   having a good time here (I'm sure he loved shooting the film in 
   Greece) and there's a running joke throughout the film where Father 
   Roche complains about Milo's driving, first complaining that he 
   drives too fast and then complaining that he is driving too slow. It 
   was also great seeing Peter Cushing playing a totally evil role for a 
   change. Even when he tries to be charming with Beth, his personality 
   just oozes the personification of evil, a role that came few and far 
   between for Cushing (although he was also pure evil in <B><A HREF="star_wars_1977.htm">STAR
    WARS</A></B>, made a year after this film). The missing five minutes 
   of footage here seem to be major sequences of nudity (the opening 
   between Milo and his totally nude girldfiend is almost two minutes 
   long) and fleeting shots of gore (especially knives entering boodies) 
   until the completely surprising exploding bodies finale, which shows 
   blood and bits of human parts flying everywhere (Also, the title 
   &quot;The Devil's Men&quot; comes shooting out the Minotaur's fiery 
   nostrils in the opening credits and not a badly-inserted title card 
   as we see in the PG version). If you have only seen this film in its 
   PG-Rated version and didn't like it, I would recommend you watch 
   Scorpion Releasing's DVD. You will probably enjoy the film a lot more 
   than you previously did. Director Costas Carayiannes (real name: 
   Kostas Karagiannes) is not much of an actor, but this film doesn't 
   force him to be one. All he has to do is act tough in certain scenes 
   and have a few, brief funny conversations with Donald Pleasence. He 
   made a lot of films in Greece (he passed away in 1993, after 
   directing an amazing 151 films from 1960 to 1991), but precious few 
   of them made it to the States. One exception was <B><A HREF="death_kiss_1976.htm">DEATH
    KISS</A></B> (1976) which he directed using the name &quot;Dacosta 
   Carayan&quot; and was released to U.S. theaters as <B><A HREF="death_kiss_1976.htm">THE

   exploitative title from <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Prism">Prism

   political agenda, party bigwig R.J. (Coleman Francis) sends 
   strait-laced political candidate Titus Moore (Titus Moody) out to get 
   the &quot;hippie vote&quot;. R.J. believes that in order to win the 
   election (he's running for State Representative, although documentary 
   footage of the 1968 Democratic Presidential convention is shown in 
   the opening minutes) Titus must infiltrate &quot;these pot users and

    is Titus' drunken shrew of a wife, Felicia (Sheryl Powell), who puts 
   him down every chance she gets (&quot;You're not man enough to do 
   anything!&quot;). Titus tells Felicia that when this election is 
   over, their marriage is over, too (This is after she strips naked and 
   drunkenly makes love to Titus, who also strips naked to reveal the 
   hairiest ass I have ever seen!). Titus and assistant Frank (Frank 
   Millen) go to the &quot;Citizens Committee To Legalize Marijuana&quot;
    to start his undercover campaign. A pot-smoking hippie named Bruce 
   (Bruce Beard) puts them in touch with hippie chick Jean (Jean Stone, 
   who we first see dancing naked to an organ-heavy tune), who pulls a 
   joint out of her snatch and offers it to Titus and Frank. Frank 
   declines, but Titus takes a deep hit and the next scene shows Titus 
   and Jean naked (Frank is gone), while Titus eats jam and peanut 
   butter out of her pussy. Jean then straps on a dildo and fucks Titus 
   in the ass, while a poster of W.C. Fields looks on approvingly! When 
   Titus reports back to R.J., it's apparent that he is taking kindly to 
   the hippie lifestyle. Titus makes it clear again to Felicia that he 
   is leaving her, so she tries to shoot him with a pistol, but misses. 
   Titus rapes her while choking her with his belt. Frank, who has 
   feelings for Felicia, tries to get R.J. to call off the hippie 
   infiltration, but he refuses. Titus (who now smokes pot every chance 
   he gets) enjoys his new life with Jean and they screw every chance 
   they get. Frank puts the moves on Felicia (we see her a few moments 
   before, masturbating in the kitchen, using the corner of a counter 
   and the refrigerator door as sex toys!) and Titus catches them having 
   sex in the bedroom, but he doesn't care! A perturbed Felicia 
   confronts Jean but, instead of fighting, they become lesbian lovers 
   (They make love in the middle of an oil field as the pumps chug up 
   and down!). Jean, being a hippie, dumps Felicia after she is done 
   with her, so Felicia follows her to an orgy, where she spots her 
   husband fucking a multitude of women. Later on, Felicia (dressed in 
   bondage gear and carrying a whip) joins in on the orgy and goes 
   crazy, stabbing Bruce with a dagger. The orgy-goers (including Titus) 
   hold her down while Jean rapes her with a strap-on (the same strap-on 
   she used to fuck Titus in the ass). Felicia runs to the bathroom, 
   mutilates herself with a razor and then commits suicide by sticking a 
   pistol up her vagina and pulling the trigger! After witnessing 
   Felicia's suicide, Frank grabs the gun and begins shooting-up the <A HREF="dirtiest_game_in_the_world_1970.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dirtiest game in the world ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="216" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>orgy,

   churning out quality entertainment, but <B>THE DIRTIEST GAME IN THE WORLD</B>,
    for all it's inherent flaws, including atrocious acting (Titus Moody 
   is horrible, as is nearly everyone else), chainsaw editing, camera 
   noises and bad sound, is still a hypnotic experience. Though not a 
   hardcore flick, it still goes way beyond the boundaries of an R 
   rating (it would get an NC-17 if rated today) and the final few 
   minutes are truly unexpectedly shocking and must be seen to be 
   appreciated. Anyone who says they saw this coming is a big fucking 
   liar! The self-mutilation/suicide sequence is very hard to watch and 
   is as bloody as anything H.G. Lewis was doing at the time. I have to 
   wonder how audiences handled this sequence in theaters, going in 
   expecting a nudity-filled sexploitationer and then viewing a woman 
   slicing into her sexual organs with a razor blade (I'm sure Walt 
   Davis' <B><A HREF="porno horror.htm#Sex Psycho">SEX PSYCHO</A></B> 
   [1971] had the same effect). This barely feature length (a little

    a violent, sexy and racially-charged exploitation film about slavery

    WITH THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1975; Perry King played the same character

   pugilistics in the back of the bordello, but when one of the boxers 
   doesn't show up, he forces Marianna to offer Drum as an opponent (For 
   those too young to remember, Ken Norton was briefly a boxing champion 
   in real life). Drum's opponent is Blaise (Yaphet Kotto; <B><A HREF="truck_turner_1974.htm">TRUCK
    TURNER</A></B> - 1974) and the bout quickly turns into a no-holds-barred
    wrestling match, complete with biting (Mike Tyson would be proud), 
   kicking and elbowing, and eventually Drum wins. Bernard wants to 
   cut-off Blaise's balls for losing, but Drum convinces Bernard to give 
   Blaise to Marianna (Even through all the bloody punching and biting, 
   Drum and Blaise become fast friends). To show his appreciation, 
   Bernard lets Drum pick out one of his slave girls as his woman, so he 
   picks Calinda (Brenda Sykes; <B><A HREF="ganja_and_hess_1973.htm">GANJA
    &amp; HESS</A></B> - 1973), but when Bernard sneaks into their 
   bedroom for a three-way (Bernard is more interested in Drum's sweet 
   asshole than Calinda's pussy), Drum slugs him in the face with 
   Bernard vowing painful revenge. Bernard shows up at the bordello with 
   some men with the intent of cutting Drum's balls off, but when Rachel 
   is shot and killed for interfering and Drum nearly kills Bernard 
   (Drum is under the impression that Rachel was his mother), Marianne 
   sends Drum to Hammond Maxwell and Falconhurst Plantation, where the 
   main slaves' job is not picking cotton, but &quot;studding 
   niggers&quot;. Marianna also throws-in Blaise and white whore Augusta 
   Chauvet (Fiona Lewis; <B><A HREF="fury_1978.htm">THE FURY</A></B> - 
   1978) as part of the deal, but Hammond doesn't want Calinda because 
   it will interfere with Drum's stud duties. Hammond buys slave Regine 
   (Pam Grier; <B><A HREF="coffy_1973.htm">COFFY</A></B> - 1973) to take 
   care of the needs of Augusta, who hopes to weasel her way into 
   Hammond's life and become the next Mrs. Maxwell. Augusta becomes the 
   terror of Falconhurst Plantation, complaining about everything and 
   physically and emotionally abusing the slaves, especially Regine, who 
   Hammond wants to use as his black &quot;bed wench&quot;. Hammond 
   wants Augusta to tame his out-of-control daughter, Sophie (Cheryl 
   &quot;Rainbeaux&quot; Smith; <A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Laserblast1978"><B>LASERBLAST</B></A> 
   - 1978). The vulgar, but somewhat likable, Hammond takes Drum under 
   his wing, teaching him how to ride a horse and putting him in a 
   supervisory position over the other slaves. The horny Sophie 
   unbuttons the pants of all the male slaves and plays with their 
   &quot;snakes&quot;, so Drum makes it his personal responsibility to 
   keep Sophie away from Blaise, because if Hammond finds them together, 
   it would be instant castration. The snotty Sophie makes a false 
   allegation to her father about Blaise (&quot;He put his thing in my 
   hand!&quot;), but Hammond catches her raising her skirt in front of a 
   chained Blaise and sends her off to finishing school. When Hammond 
   throws a party to announce his marriage to Augusta and the whole town 
   shows up, including Marianna, Bernard and cruel slave trader Zeke 
   Montgomery (Royal Dano; <B><A HREF="ghoulies_2_1987.htm">GHOULIES II</A></B> 
   - 1987), Drum discovers that Blaise has been castrated (by Augusta's 
   orders), so he sets Blaise free and starts a slave revolt, which

   is Carver's footage. The screenplay, by Norman Wexler (<B><A HREF="joe_1970.htm">JOE</A></B>

   full of exploitable elements, including rape, prostitution, slavery, 
   castration and whippings, but it could have been a lot more sleazier 
   than it turned out. While there is plenty of nudity and violence, 
   none of it presses the boundaries of a Hard R like <B><A HREF="mandingo_1975b.htm">MANDINGO</A></B> 
   did. Even Bernard's castration by Drum's hand is implied rather than 
   shown. There is also a lot to like here, too, from Warren Oates 
   playful performance as a slave breeder (his dialogue about 
   popping-out little &quot;suckers&quot; is hilarious), to a cast of 
   seasoned pros, but <B><A HREF="drum_1976d.htm">DRUM</A></B> is

    He brings them home so he and Christina can rape and kill them. The 
   newspapers label them the &quot;Hitchhiker Killers&quot; and the 
   police are clueless. Everything goes fine until Christina falls in 
   love with a patient; an artist who is having an affair with the 
   married (and insatiable) Countess Marina (Marina Delestra), a 
   frequent visitor to the clinic who has worn out seven husbands with 
   her sexual appetites. Christina begs the Professor to stop the 
   killings, but he enjoys it too much. In the end, the Countess 
   Marina's husband (Chris Regan) shoots the Countess because she caught 
   him stealing her jewels and Christina runs a sword through the 
   Professor to stop his killings and so she can be with her artist 
   love. This unrated soft core Stockholm-made production boasts plenty 
   of nudity and simulated sex but is highly repetitious. A scene of a 
   couple in the clinic is always followed by a scene of the Professor 
   cruising for hitchhikers. No reason is given for the Professor's love 
   of strangling his victims. The violence is implied rather than shown.

   Marilyn Howard (Katherine Cortez)? When a necking couple find their 
   bodies lying in a field shot to death with Marilyn's throat also cut 
   and tongue ripped out, the film flashes back to the beginning of the 
   mess. Marilyn lives in a filthy house with Jess (Kenneth G. Sigmon), 
   her fat slob of a husband who sits on the couch all day drinking beer 
   and watching TV. The Reverend Moss has Clair (Nita Patterson), his 
   shrew of a wife who refuses to make love to him, saying it's filthy 
   and disgusting. When the Reverend and Marilyn meet at church, they 
   fall in love and start an affair. Cut to the present again, as the 
   police interrogate the suspects: Clair (&quot;That filthy bitch&quot; 
   is all she has to say about Marilyn); Mose Cooper, a religious 
   fanatic (&quot;Sins should not go unpunished&quot;); Jess (&quot;The 
   Reverend was a fine man&quot;) and; Billy (William F. Hipp), Clair's 
   crazy brother. With no leads, District Attorney Grover (Don Cummins) 
   is squeezed by the Governor to get a conviction and get it quick. 
   Since Mose Cooper has the weakest alibi, he is tried for the crimes. 
   His religious outbursts in court easily convict him for the crimes 
   and he is sentenced to death by electric chair. Mose is strapped down 
   and prepped on the Old Sparky (lovingly detailed) and just as the 
   switch is about to be thrown, the phone rings. It's the Governor and 
   he has given Mose a reprieve, It seems Mose was having an affair with 
   a divorced woman and he was with her at the time of the killings. She 
   had come forward to save Mose, feeling he would rather die than tell 
   the truth, fearing being called a hypocrite with his religious 
   convictions and all. Next up on trial: Clair and Crazy Billy. D.A. 
   Grover makes the case that Clair overheard her husband talking to 
   Marilyn over the phone setting up a clandestine meeting. She then 
   talked Billy into coming with her to help in killing them. Billy 
   answers all the D.A.'s questions on the stand like a retard until 
   Grover asks him, &quot;Did your mother have any children that 
   lived?&quot; Defense Attorney Klein (Martin McDonald) completely 
   discredits all of the prosecution's witnesses and it looks as if 
   Clair and Billy will get off. That is, until Billy freaks out in the 
   courtroom, grabs a gun, shouts out to Clair,&quot;I'm not going to 
   fry for your jealousy&quot; and kills four people, including his 
   attorney, before he is shot and killed. Clair is convicted for the 
   crimes and is sentenced to the electric chair, where we see her fry 
   after telling everyone watching to &quot;Go to Hell!&quot; This weird

   seems Mr. Patterson probably never saw it released to the general

   pretty involving story, offering the viewer a surprise or two along 
   the way. It still has a lot of Patterson's trademarks: Flubbed lines

   film a distinct regional style (filmed in North and South Carolina)

   actors. Worth Keeter (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Wolfman1979">WOLFMAN</A></B>

    The film begins with a performance art piece, where female inmates

    AND THE LAST CANNIBALS</A></B> - 1977) discuss their innermost 
   thoughts about life in prison. Coleen (Lorraine De Selle; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#HouseEdgePark1979">HOUSE
    ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK</A></B> - 1979), the warden of the 
   correctional facility, sanctioned this piece of performance art to 
   teach new inmates what it means to be a prisoner, but butch lesbian 
   (what else?) inmate Albina (Ursula Flores) thinks this is all a 
   little too much and throws a tomato at Emanuelle, hitting her in the 
   face (if Albina threw some spaghetti, Emanuelle would have had a meal!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Cruel prison guard Molly (Fran&ccedil;oise Perrot) favors 
   Albina&nbsp; and punishes inmates for siding against her. Molly and 
   another guard (Franca Stoppi; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BeyondTheDarkness79">BEYOND
    THE DARKNESS</A></B> - 1979) make Emanuelle stick her head in a sink 
   full of water and hold it there until she passes out. They don't 
   actually hold her head in the water, but make Emanuelle do it to 
   herself, just to prove the power guards have over the inmates. After 
   her ordeal, Emanuelle gets in a fight with Albina (who punches 
   Emanuelle in the face), where Emanuelle discovers Albina is wearing a 
   wig (she is going bald!). Emanuelle laughs in Albina's face and then 
   Molly has the two face-off, Albina with a knife and Emanuelle with 
   her bare hands, which ends up with Albina with a knife sticking out 
   of her leg.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then find out Emanuelle is a reporter. She was doing a story on 
   drug trafficking when crooked District Attorney Vincent Robinson 
   (Jacques Stany; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#FourFliesVelvet1971">FOUR 
   FLIES ON GREY VELVET</A></B> - 1971) had her arrested on a trumped-up 
   charge of drug possession and had her thrown into this prison for 
   five years. Emanuelle vows vengeance and won't rest until the D.A. 
   gets what's coming to him. We then watch as four Death Row criminals, 
   Crazy Boy Henderson (Gabriele Tinti; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EerieMidnight1974">THE

   escorted to prison by Sergeant Harrison (Carlo De Mejo; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#OtherHell">THE
    OTHER HELL</A></B> - 1980). Criminals dressed as policemen run their 
   van off the road and kill two real policemen in the process. The four 
   criminals try to escape, but Sergeant Harrison gets the upper hand, 
   telling Crazy Boy, &quot;You'll have no peace until you smell the 
   stink of you own flesh roasting on the electric Chair!&quot; and then 
   personally drives them to prison, the same prison Emanuelle is in 
   (There's no prison like a coed prison!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    These four criminals are multiple rapists and murderers, who are 
   temporarily housed in this prison until their death sentences can be 
   carried out. They are being put in a wing of the prison where they 
   keep the most dangerous criminals but, as they are having their 
   handcuffs removed, Crazy Boy and Blade take the Warden and a female 
   guard hostage and threaten to kill them unless Harrison turns over 
   his shotgun. To prove they mean business, Blade, who has a razor 
   blade hidden in his mouth, graphically slits the female guard's neck, 
   killing her. Harrison hands his shotgun over to Crazy Boy, who blasts 
   Harrison in the shoulder. The four murderous rapists take Harrison, 
   the Warden and the female prisoners hostage, demanding a getaway car, 
   lots of money and a helicopter from D.A. Robinson, who is handling 
   the negotiations. If he doesn't meet their demands in three hours, 
   Harrison, the Warden and the female inmates will be killed.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Three hours is a long time, so the rapists have some &quot;fun&quot; 
   with the women. Blade makes the Warden strip in front of him and 
   Geronimo looks for some morphine in the prison infirmary, where 
   Albina is recuperating from her knife wound. Geronimo and Albina make 
   a connection and screw on a bed in the infirmary, while Brett is 
   being felt-up by some horny female inmates, many of them haven't felt 
   a man in years. Crazy Boy tortures Harrison by sticking his fingers 
   in his shoulder wound and when Emanuelle protests (she is nursing 
   Harrison), Crazy Boy rapes her. Blade enters Laura and Irene's cell, 
   dances with them and slits the throat of Irene's blow-up doll. Irene 
   complains, so Blade slices her face.&nbsp; Blade loses his razor 
   blade and Laura finds it. She will need it laterto get revenge on 
   blade for cutting Irene's face (they are lovers).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Albina sees some SWAT team members enter the infirmary window and 
   runs to Crazy Boy to make a deal. She warns them about what is 
   approaching and when the SWAT team kills some female prisoners (they 
   don't care who they kill, even though they are recording their attack 
   on video!) Crazy Boy and his mates kill them, turning the video 
   camera on themselves, telling the D.A. that he will pay for his 
   deception. They make Emanuelle and Albina play a game of Russian 
   roulette (What about Albina's deal?), while Laura strips naked and 
   tempts Blade to come to her cell. They make love, but when Helmut 
   goes to screw her, he discovers that Laura shoved his razord blade up 
   her snatch (!) and he loses his penis! A dickless Blade strangles 
   Laura with his bare hands and tries to stumble back to his mates, but 
   the horny female prisoners grab him through the bars, where he dies. 
   Meanwhile, Albina blows her brains out in the game of Russian 
   roulette, pieces of her brain landing in Crazy Boy's mouth. Crazy Boy 
   and Geronimo leave the prison (What happened to Brett???), taking 
   Harrison, the Warden and Emanuelle as hostages. Emanuelle catches 
   sight of D.A. Robinson and it triggers a flashback that shows us how 
   the D.A. illegally sent Emanuelle to prison. When the D.A. spots 
   Emanuelle, he grabs a cop's rifle and shoots Geronimo and the Warden, 
   killing them (Why didn't he shoot Emanuelle???). Crazy Boy kills the 
   D.A. with the shotgun, grabs the money and getaway car, still taking 
   Harrison and Emanuelle hostage. The car stalls a short distance from 
   the prison <A HREF="womens_prison_massacre_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/womens prison massacre poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(there
    was only enough gas in the car to travel a very short distance) and 
   the cop driving the getaway car shoots Crazy Boy in the stomach (Why 
   didn't he shoot him in the head???), who return fire with the 
   shotgun, blowing away the cop and the driver side door! Harrison 
   subdues a mortally wounded Crazy Boy and he promises Emanuelle that 
   he will get her out of prison because he knows she is innocent. THE END.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This crazy and illogical film turns the W.I.P genre on its head. 
   While there are the prerequisite naked shower scenes and lesbian 
   action in the beginning of the film, it quickly switches from the 
   typical genre cliches, turning into a hostage drama and then a 
   revenge flick. The film makes no sense at all, especially Albina 
   making a deal with Crazy Boy and then she puts a bullet in her own 
   brainpan, or the D.A not shooting Emanuelle when he had the chance, 
   but it's not about making sense. It's about stuffing as much rape, 
   debouchery and blood as can possibly fit into a 90-minute film. This 
   contains all the crazy shit we counted on from the late Bruno Mattei, 
   mainly full-frontal nudity, sleaze and gore. You get that and so much 
   more, including ineptly-filmed car chases, explosions and bloody 
   bullet squibs. But, Claudio Fragasso claimed (in the book &quot;<A HREF="spaghetti_nightmares_book.htm">Spaghetti
    Nightmares</A>&quot;) that he actually directed the majority of the 
   film while Mattei was directing another film (<B><A HREF="seven_magnificent_gladiators_1983.htm">THE

   interviews (Mattei and Fragasso, who were good friends, frequently 
   switched roles in their careers). Laura Gemser, who appeared as <A HREF="emanuelle_films_1973-1983.htm">Emanuelle

   (Sonny Carl Davis; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Wacko">WACKO</A></B> 
   - 1982) and Jessie (Marshall Ford) have a lucrative business 
   delivering bales of marijuana and bricks of cocaine in their small 
   plane. They also deal the drugs in the rural Texas town they live in 
   and are also not above using the drugs themselves from time to time 
   (never a good thing). They start spreading the super-strong pot 
   around to their sub-dealers, including the extra-careful (some would 
   say paranoid) Jimmy (Jimmy Seay), the laid-back Ernie (D. Dryden 
   Arnsberger) and good-old-boy Buddy (Lou Perryman, a.k.a. &quot;Lou 
   Perry&quot;; <B><A HREF="texas_chainsaw_massacre_2b.htm">THE TEXAS 
   CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2</A></B> - 1986), and soon they gain attention of 
   some &quot;Yankee&quot; people up north, who show interest in 
   distributing J.D.'s &amp; Jessie's product on the East Coast. Jessie 
   wants to retire from the drug running/selling business after this 
   season ends, thanks to advice from retired smuggler Luther (John 
   Martin), who tells Jessie to stop snorting cocaine, quit pushing his 
   luck and &quot;just do it&quot; (He sounds like a Nike<A HREF="fast_money_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/fast money vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="184" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   commercial). Their luck starts to turn bad when J.D. and Buddy make a 
   big delivery to two East Coast yankees in a hotel room, but the 
   northern clients make them drop the price drastically before they 
   will buy it (they slice open five sacks of pot and will only buy two 
   sacks unless they drop the price, leaving J.D. to explain to Jessie 
   why three sacks of pot are cut open, so J.D. has no choice but to 
   drop the price $1,000 a pound!). J.D.'s girlfriend, Nancy (Linda 
   Wetherby), wants him to get a real job and quit the drug business. 
   When she catches him dealing, she throws a bowl of mashed potatoes at 
   him (J.D. tells a bartender, &quot;I left the house when she started 
   throwing canned goods!&quot;). Jessie's cocaine use gets out of hand 
   and he starts making terrible business decisions. He plans on making 
   a drug run across the border that is twice the size of his previous 
   trips. It involves two plane trips, which results in J.D. getting 
   arrested by the D.E.A. at one makeshift airstrip and Bobby being 
   followed carrying a truckload of dope by D.E.A. agent Burton (Tim 
   Miller). Buddy loses Burton's tail and Jessie gets away thanks to 
   expert pilot Dusty (Sammy Allred), but J.D. is booked and eventually 
   makes bail. Burton, who is undercover, buys fifty pounds of marijuana 
   from Ernie and then sets up a sting to nab Jessie and J.D. with their 
   hands in the cookie jar. When Buddy has a truckload of pot stolen 
   from him (and his friend murdered in the process) and J.D. is nearly 
   nabbed in the drug sting, Jessie and J.D. decide to move to Mexico, 
   but will they able to make it to their plane before Burton arrests 
   them? Of course they do and they live happily ever after. I think I'm 
   gonna be ill.&nbsp; There's not much point to this film, directed and 
   written by Douglas Holloway (Whose only other screen credit was as 
   Associate Producer on director Eagle Pennell's debut film, <B><A HREF="whole_shootin_match_1978.htm">THE
    WHOLE SHOOTIN' MATCH</A></B> [1978], which stars many of the same

   independent drama <B><A HREF="last_night_at_the_alamo_1983.htm">LAST 
   NIGHT AT THE ALAMO</A></B> [1983], starring Lou Perryman [who was 
   murdered on April 1, 2009] and Sonny Carl Davis, both stars of this 
   film), except to show a series of vignettes of Jessie, J.D. and their 
   friends enjoying abusing cocaine, marijuana and booze and going about 
   their daily business of dealing drugs. The film goes out of its way 
   glorifying these people and their way of life, as they count their 
   money, snort their lines of coke and go to discos to celebrate. 
   Nowhere in this film do we see the damage their drugs do to society 
   (Hey, I'm no prude. I've smoked my good share of pot and nearly 
   destroyed my life on cocaine in the mid-80's, but I turned my life 
   around. How many people didn't?). We're supposed to have feelings for 
   these people, but it is a very hard sell, especially to anyone who 
   has lost a loved one to drugs or has to deal with a junkie friend or 
   family member. This film is not badly acted (Lou Perry really stands 
   out), but the storyline, where the police are portrayed as a bunch of 
   buffoons and the drug dealers as heroes (a product of the 
   70's/early-80's counterculture, but this is no <B><A HREF="superfly_1972.htm">SUPERFLY</A></B> 
   (1972) blaxploitation flick or Cheech &amp; Chong comedy), just 
   doesn't ring true, at least in my eyes. If a film like this were made 
   today, it would be akin to portraying crack dealers as fine 
   upstanding citizens. It just doesn't wash. This film would make a 
   good double bill with 1977's <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#In Hot Pursuit">IN

    THE HERETIC</A><A NAME="FlaviaTheHeretic74"></A> (1974) -</B> I have 
   never been a fan of the Italian &quot;nunsploitation&quot; genre, as 
   I find the antics of sex-crazed nuns unappealing to me (no matter how 
   beautiful they are), but this film, which is one of the first films 
   to give birth to the genre, is more like &quot;Joan Of Arc&quot; than 
   a straight-up exploitation film, and, even though it has its share of 
   exploitative moments, it plays more like a historical drama than it 
   does a nunsploitation film. It could be because it was 
   directed/produced/co-written by Gianfranco Mingozzi, who was better 
   known for his many documentaries than for any other type of genre. 
   Maybe that's why this film seems more like a chronicle of one 
   person's life, told through her eyes, as she witnesses the worst that 
   religion and politics (that go hand-in-hand in this film) than a 
   sex-laden portrayal of a convent, which most nunsploitation flicks 
   portray. Don't get me wrong; there is plenty of nudity and violence 
   in this film, but the nudity is not there to titillate audiences and 
   the violence is shown to relay to us just how bad it was in 1400's 
   Europe, especially for women. <B><A HREF="flavia_the_heretic_1974c.htm">FLAVIA

   seats) opens in 1400 A.D., with the title female (Florinda Bolkan; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#LastHouseBeach">LAST
    HOUSE ON THE BEACH</A></B> - 1978) looking upon a field of dead 
   enemy Muslims after a major battle. When she tries to give aid to a 
   wounded Muslim soldier, her father (Diego Michelotti), a general who 
   fought for the other side, decapitates the Muslim soldier and parades 
   around with his head on a pike for all his soldiers to see. To teach 
   Flavia a lesson for showing such insolence, he sends her to a convent 
   in Portugal, where she has her hair sheared off like a sheep would 
   (All the convent women's hair is used as hair for the statues of 
   Christ as he is crucified on the cross, which the nuns manufacture. 
   Women's hair on a holy man's statue. Does anyone see the irony in 
   this?) and made to lie on a cold stone floor face-down for long 
   periods of time, with her arms out to the side so that she looks like 
   a crucifix. Flavia remains a rebel, for every time she looks at a 
   religious fresco of a saint on one of the convent's wall, she see the 
   image of a Muslim soldier coming to life to lead a battle. The 
   convent gets a visit from the members of the Tarantula Cult, who act 
   crazy (one of the head nuns says they act that way because they were 
   bitten by tarantulas!), sexually writhing and dancing around the 
   convent's religious statues and artifacts, a practice Flavia finds 
   both strange and fascinating (consider them the 1400's version of the 
   Charles Manson Family). Most of the nuns are repulsed watching these 
   female cult members rubbing their naughty bits with their hands and 
   religious objects, while a few other nuns are converted and join in 
   the sexual shenanigans, baring their breasts and begging for the 
   tarantulas to bite them, too. Flavia watches Sister Livia (Raika 
   Juri), who is her friend, get into some lesbian activity with one of 
   the cult members, but this turns out to be a trap by convent's Mother 
   Superior (Jill Pratt; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WatchMeKill1977">WATCH 
   ME WHEN I KILL</A></B> - 1977), who lets these loons enter the 
   convent once a year to weed out the bad apprentice nuns, and then 
   tortures the ones who don't follow the Scripture, by stringing them 
   up with rope, making them sit in the hollowed-out carcass of an cow 
   or by tying their hands behind their backs and twisting the rope 
   tighter by using a wooden crucifix, while Mother Superior says, 
   &quot;You must pay for your sins!&quot;. Of course, Flavia is 
   horrified to see such tactics used. Flavia's only friend outside the 
   convent is Jewish peasant Abraham (Claudio Cassenelli; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#GreatAlligator">THE
    GREAT ALLIGATOR</A></B> - 1979), who has discussions with Flavia 
   about the first woman on Earth, which wasn't Eve, but 
   &quot;Lillith&quot;, who Abraham says was &quot;made from the refuge 
   of the Devil.&quot; Flavia questions why women have to be subservient 
   to men and asks Abraham what would happen if a woman took the lead in 
   a male-dominated society. Abraham really doesn't have an answer but 
   it gets him thinking. While Flavia is walking back to the convent, 
   she watches as some nuns castrate a horse (nothing is left to the 
   imagination) and is appalled at what she just witnessed (There is so 
   much symbolism in this film, the Blu-Ray should come with a booklet 
   explaining them all!). When the Bishop and his guards pay a visit to 
   the convent, Sister Livia is handed over to him, where he will have 
   his Inquisition-like religious zealot guards torture her to death. 
   Flavia then witnesses a French Duke (Spiros Focas) rape a defenseless 
   peasant girl in a pig sty (Like I said, we need a symbolism guide) 
   and when the Duke catches Flavia watching him doing the dirty deed 
   (in more ways than one!), he threatens to rape her, too, telling her 
   who would the Church believe, an influential French Duke or a nun? 
   (In that era, the Duke would win every time). Flavia storms back to 
   the convent and defiantly pulls the loincloth off the statue of Jesus 
   and asks him, &quot;Why... why? Why is God male? The Father the Son 
   and the Holy Ghost - all male. Even the twelve apostles. All twelve 
   of them - males.&quot; We are about to witness Flavia become the 
   first true Feminist, but with a violent twist. Flavia watches at the 
   top of the torture chamber (it has a large windowless hole in the top 
   of the roof) as the Bishop and his guards torture Sister Livia by 
   pouring boiling hot oil on her breasts and torso while she screams 
   for mercy. When Flavia's father catches her watching the torture 
   session, he tells his &quot;cursed&quot; daughter to return to the 
   convent, but Flavia replies he is the cursed one because he and all 
   the other men treat women worse than dogs. She tells her father that 
   what they see happening below them would never happen to the French 
   Duke for raping an innocent woman, so Daddy slaps Flavia hard across 
   her face. They both watch as one of the torturers grabs one of Sister 
   Livia's nipples with iron tongs and then slices it off with a dagger 
   (The film's most graphic and wincing scene). This proves to be the 
   proverbial straw that breaks Flavia's back. She is about to strike a 
   blow for all womankind and it's going to be bloody. She asks Abraham 
   to go far away with her because she has escaped the convent, like 
   &quot;Lilith escaped Adam.&quot; They end up at a beach on the ocean, 
   where they barely escape the Bishop's search party (Abraham was under 
   house arrest for committing heresy). They are eventually caught, 
   though (just as virgin Flavia was going to give herself to Abraham), 
   and Flavia is stripped, tied to a post and whipped repeatedly while 
   her father watches (she spits in his direction as a sign of 
   defiance). Abraham is thrown in a dungeon and not even tortured (he 
   is a man after all). Flavia is brought back to the convent, where she 
   has visions of picking up a sword, joining the Muslim army and 
   fighting their oppressors. The once-cruel Mother Superior actually 
   admires Flavia now, as she shares her feelings with her. She also 
   thinks that it is a male-dominated world and the time has come for 
   women to stand their ground. Flavia gets an even more heightened 
   sense of empowerment from Mother Superior's words. She makes Flavia 
   feel that the female of the species is the stronger of the sexes and 
   when a Muslim army arrives by ship to attack the Church's army, 
   Flavia joins &quot;The Other World&quot; and fights side-by-side with 
   the handsome Ahmed (Anthony Corlan; <B><A HREF="vampire_circus_1972.htm">VAMPIRE
    CIRCUS</A></B> - 1972), the man in her visions, to destroy the 
   Church and all it stands for, especially after she sees her father 
   impale Mother Superior with a spear. Flavia's father is captured and 
   as soon as Flavia and Ahmed lock eyes, they know they were meant for 
   each other and he takes Flavia's virginity. After a lengthy battle in 
   the village (where we see a friar impaled on a pike through his ass 
   and out his neck), Flavia, Ahmed and the Muslim army head to the 
   convent, where the nuns cower behind the bolted door. The army 
   batters it down and Flavia heads into the convent on horseback, 
   throwing a mace that sticks in the face of the fresco of their patron 
   saint. Flavia points out the cruel nuns to the army and they kidnap 
   them. Flavia now has the role of Bishop, as she holds a funeral for 
   Mother Superior, while making her captive father watch. Flavia has 
   the innocent girl earlier in the film try to rape the French Duke, 
   but when it is apparent that the Duke is enjoying himself, he is bent 
   over a barrel, butt-fucked by some guards and then castrated, like 
   Flavia saw the horse castrated earlier in<A HREF="flavia_the_heretic_1974c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/flavia the heretic blu-ray front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="261" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   the film (The Duke is now a Duchess!). Flavia has another vision, 
   where the fresco of the saint comes alive and pulls the mace off his 
   face. Mother Superior rises from the dead as the blood of the saint 
   flows onto a naked Ahmed's back. Jesus is no longer crucified on the 
   cross. In his place are totally naked females, as are all the nuns, 
   and the door of the convent opens with a blinding light behind it 
   (There is too much symbolism in this scene to even describe in a 
   review). Flavia wakes up with her hands covered in candle wax 
   (showing she has had that vision for a loooong time) and discovers 
   all the nuns are dead (some are hanged, some have their throats slit 
   and others are impaled with spears). Flavia dons a suit of armor and 
   joins the fight, where she discovers the Church has sent 
   reinforcements to the village and Flavia's father is free. Flavia 
   chases her father on horseback and watches as Ahmed's army pushes her 
   father off the hole in the roof of the torture chamber, killing him. 
   When Flavia discovers Abraham is still alive, she goes running to 
   him, but a jealous Ahmed cuts off Abraham's head with a scimitar. 
   Flavia discovers &quot;The Other World&quot; is no different than 
   when she was living as a nun at the convent. She watches Ahmed and 
   what is left of his army sail back to his homeland and Flavia is 
   taken prisoner by the Church for treason. Her punishment is a 
   particularly cruel and painful one: She has the skin just above both 
   her ankles cut all around and is flayed alive by pulling her skin off 
   her body from the ankles-up. She screams while an on-screen scrawl 
   states that the idea behind this film came from the true story known 
   as &quot;The Martyrdom Of The 800 At Otranto&quot; (Google it if you 
   want to learn more).&nbsp; While scenes in this film are 
   exploitative, this really isn't an exploitation film. It is more of a 
   historical document on the way women across the world were treated as 
   less than human for centuries (Hell, women didn't get the right to 
   vote in the United States until the 1920's!). Like I said in the 
   beginning of this film, director Gianfranco Mingozzi made precious 
   few fictional films, rather making documentaries right up until he 
   passed away in 2009. That is why this film could play as a biography 
   of a real person (it isn't though) because everything we see is 
   through Flavia's eyes. But Italians being Italians, they certainly 
   knew how to bastardize what was obviously a serious film and made 
   many &quot;nunsploitation&quot; films (like Bruno Mattei's <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#OtherHell">THE
    OTHER HELL</A></B> [1980] and too many more to begin listing) that 
   play the sex and violence angle purely for entertainment. I actually 
   hate the genre (just like I despise &quot;Naziploitation&quot; 
   films), which is why you see precious few of them reviewed on this 
   web site. Released years ago in uncut widescreen form on <A HREF="flavia_the_heretic_1974c.htm">DVD</A>

   they shared three weeks earlier is now occupied by another couple and 
   when she goes to see him at his place of business, his secretary 
   tells Andrea that she hasn't heard from him in weeks, but that's not 
   unusual for him. Andrea is followed and then attacked by a Chinese 
   man dressed in black, but she beats him up with some awkward kung-fu 
   moves. Dave and Toby try to have a good time in Hong Kong while 
   trying to avoid Toby's meddlesome and disapproving mother (a job 
   easier said than done), Sherry is kidnapped by Hong Kong drug dealers 
   and Andrea makes a new friend in importer Rick Shaw (Leo Martinez). 
   When Sherry doesn't show up for her flight to Tokyo the next morning, 
   Toby and Andrea incredibly leave without her. Once in Tokyo (and 
   after making love to Rick Shaw), Andrea goes to a Japanese garden to 
   meet Donald, only to be attacked by two martial artists, which she 
   beats up with the help of a blind man with a dart-firing cane! We 
   then learn why Sherry was kidnapped. It seems she is a drug mule 
   along with boyfriend Bill (Cole Mallard), but this time she only 
   delivered half of her shipment and her bosses want the other half. 
   Meanwhile, Dave and Toby are still trying to get some alone time, but 
   Mama doesn't want her daughter popping her cherry with Dave (Yeah, 
   Toby really is a virgin!). All the stories come together when Rick 
   Shaw (Get it? Rickshaw?) confesses to Andrea that he's a British 
   agent trying to bring down Donald, who is actually the head of a drug 
   and white slavery cartel that Sherry was working for. Andrea agrees 
   to work with Rick Shaw to bring down Donald and rescue Sherry. Toby's 
   interfering mother accidentally gets herself and Toby mixed-up in a 
   white slavery auction, where Dave rescues Toby and her mother and 
   Andrea and Rick Shaw bring down Donald and save Sherry.&nbsp; 
   Although too much stuff goes on in such a short running time (72 
   minutes), director Cirio H. Santiago makes the most of Miller Drake's (<B><A HREF="invasion_earth_the_aliens_are_here_1988.htm">INVASION
    EARTH: THE ALIENS ARE HERE</A></B> - 1988) jumbled screenplay, 
   tossing in plentiful topless female nudity, a dollop of martial arts 
   (kung fu sequences directed by David Chow), a couple of bloody 
   shootouts, some comedy and, of course, plenty of softcore sex scenes. 
   This is just a breezy, quick-moving little exploitationer that 
   delivers what it promises: naked women, action and a multi-tiered 
   story that ties-up nicely in the finale. They just don't make 'em 
   like this anymore and after directing <B><A HREF="cover_girl_models_1975.htm">COVER

   Dialogue Director, as does Jonathan Demme, who is credited with the 
   confusing credit &quot;Film Direction&quot; (actually Second Unit

   little hike when one of the girls is abducted by one of the pirates 
   that has lived on the island for years. The pirates take the men to 
   the &quot;Valley of the Sun&quot; where they meet Jayson (Cameron 
   Mitchell), a captain of a wrecked ship who has been held prisoner on 
   the island for 17 years. By now he is quite mad, babbling on about 
   &quot;red corpuscles&quot; and Edgar Alan Poe while one of the 
   pirates sedates him by sticking a large hypo needle in the top of his 
   head. The men are then taken to a mansion where they meet Sheila 
   Frankenstein (Katherine Victor) and she tells the men she wants them 
   to impregnate the amazons so the island can have some new blood. She 
   then takes them to her husband's laboratory, where they see brains 
   under glass, a force of mindless robots (who wear cheap sunglasses 
   and wool ski caps), learn that the island was once visited by aliens 
   and meet Sheila's bedridden husband, Dr. Van Helsing (George 
   Mitchell). There's also genetically produced giant vegetables, robot 
   boxing, kung fu fighting, somebody with a plastic devil's pitchfork 
   who performs a supernatural ritual and, every once in a while, the 
   superimposed image of Dr. Frankenstein (John Carradine) pops-up on 
   screen to shout, &quot;The power! The power!&quot; What does this all 
   mean? I haven't got a fucking clue. All I know is that it's howlingly 
   bad. Did I forget to mention that Frankenstein's Monster appears at 
   the end for no other reason than to give this film a reason to end? 
   The final battle in the laboratory looks like it was choreographed by 
   Stevie Wonder.&nbsp; Being directed by 50's and 60's cheapsploitation 
   expert Jerry Warren (<B><A HREF="man_beast_1955.htm">MAN BEAST</A></B>

   OF BATWOMAN</A></B> - 1966), it comes as no surprise that this film 
   has the look and feel of an early 60's production as there is no 
   blood, nudity or foul language, just a music soundtrack that consists 
   of library cues, tons of cheap cardboard sets and dime store props 
   (check out those Don Post skulls!). Warren also populates the film 
   with 50's and 60's B-actors. Besides the already-mentioned Mitchell, 
   Carradine and Victor, we also have Robert Clarke (<B><A HREF="hideous_sun_demon_1959.htm">HIDEOUS

   - 1973). The screenplay (by Jaques Lacouter) makes absolutely no 
   sense and seems to throw in all the old-time horror and sci-fi 
   conventions (mad scientists, aliens, illicit experimants, ray guns, 
   voodoo rituals, monster on the loose, etc.) in hopes of keeping you 
   entertained. It's as if Jerry Warren wanted to make one more film 
   (this was his last, he died in 1988) to remind us of the good old 
   days of cheap exploitation films. Unfortunately, <B><A HREF="frankenstein_island_1981b.htm">FRANKENSTEIN

   good. This is too boring to even have novelty value. What a waste. 
   There's an extra on the DVD where Katherine Victor reminisces about 
   the making of the film. It runs about three minutes. I guess there

   making this belated sequel, but the results are less than 
   satisfactory. The film opens with Angelique (Jan MacKenzie), a big 
   city woman who moves to Cajun country to marry her sweetheart Big T. 
   (Tray Loren). The wedding is crashed by Leroy (Paul Muzzcat) and four 
   of his backwoods hick friends (They all make normal hillbillies look 
   like proper gentlemen, especially when one of them complains, 
   &quot;We'll scare up some new city pussy. The pussy around here 
   smells like catfish!&quot;).

    friends paw at the women, eat the wedding cake and make general 
   nuisances of themselves until Big T. and his groomsmen show Leroy and 
   his posse a little Cajun hospitality (in other words, they beat the 
   snot out of them). Angelique and Big T. escape in their powerboat for 
   their &quot;honeymoon&quot;, but Cajun tradition dictates that his 
   friends try to stop them from having sex that night (a tradition that 
   was also practiced in <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Nightmare Honeymoon">NIGHTMARE
    HONEYMOON</A></B> - 1973), so they chase the happy couple down the 
   river, but Big T.'s boat is too fast and his friends are too drunk. 
   There's also bad blood between Big T. and Leroy, because ten years 
   earlier, Leroy raped and killed Big T.'s sister, so Big T. shot him 
   and left him to die in the swamp, but &quot;the swamp didn't want 
   him&quot; and Leroy survived. Big T. teaches city girl Angelique how 
   to handle snakes (he has a bunch of rattlesnakes as pets), how to use 
   a shotgun, how to call an alligator and how to defend herself in 
   hand-to-hand combat, all skills she will have to use shortly to save 
   her life. One day, while Big T. is away attending to his traps in the 
   bayou, Leroy and his scuzzball friends pay Angelique a visit, first 
   ogling her from afar as she takes a bath on the deck of their 
   riverside home (it's really more of a shack) and then humiliate her 
   for way too long (it's really disappointing how many exploitation 
   elements are ignored here, as rather than making her take her clothes 
   off, they sexually abuse her while she is clad in a towel and then 
   Leroy makes her put on a pair of panties and a bodice!). When Leroy 
   finally decides it's time to rape her, Big T. shows up and Leroy 
   shoots him in the back and ties his not-yet-dead body to a tree stump 
   in the swamp (it's payback for what happened ten years earlier). 
   Leroy and his dentally-challenged gang kidnap Angelique and bring her 
   back to their hideout, chain her up and take turns raping her 
   (offscreen). Angelique escapes, thanks to Luke (Brad Kepnick), a 
   member of Leroy's gang who thinks that all this is wrong. Angelique 
   uses every trick Big T. taught her to exact revenge on these bayou 
   hicks. Don't worry, Big T. shows up in the nick of time to blow Leroy 
   away before he can stab Angelique in her &quot;city pussy&quot;.&nbsp;
    <B>GATOR BAIT II: CAJUN JUSTICE</B> is just one missed opportunity 
   after another. It's as if Ferd &amp; Beverly Sebastian tried to make 
   a revenge actioner without any of the basic ingredients that fans of 
   the genre have come to expect. The nudity is kept to a minimum, most 
   of the violence (including the rapes) is kept offscreen and Leroy 
   couldn't be any less scary as the main villain. The Sebastians played 
   their cards way too close to their vests, like they didn't want the 
   MPAA breathing down their necks with imposed cuts (although Luke's 
   throat-slitting by Leroy does look to be edited). A clear 40% of the 
   film is of people steering their boats through the Louisiana bayou 
   and while that may be beautiful travelogue footage, it goes on for 
   far too long. Jan MacKenzie and Tray Loren have some nice, easy-going 
   charisma with each other (much of their dialogue seems improvised and 
   real), but Paul Muzzcat and his gang couldn't be more stereotypical, 
   including Geke (Reyn Hubbard), who's a long-haired, trucker 
   hat-wearing, stuttering retard. This is nothing but a pale imitation 
   of the original <B><A HREF="gator_bait.htm">GATOR BAIT</A></B> and 
   Jan MacKenzie (who has a nice body) lacks Claudia Jennings' natural 
   intensity. It's hard to imagine that a city girl like Angelique could 
   suddenly turn superwoman and beat five guys, who were raised on the 
   bayou, at their own game.<B> GATOR BAIT II</B> is all build-up and no pay-off.
    It's like getting bitten by a snake with no fangs. Also starring 
   Jerry Armstrong, Ben Sebastian, Rocky Dugas and Keith Gros.

   blown-up while tobogganing (!) down a ski slope, it's apparent that 
   Ronnie (who is also a guest at the lodge) is beginning to thin out 
   the good guys before she kidnaps her target. Ginger is able to get in 
   bed with Whitney rather easily (she sings a couple of songs and does 
   a fluorescent striptease at the lodge's cocktail lounge [while Ms. 
   Caffaro has a smoking hot body, her musical talents are far less than 
   stellar]) and, while they are making love, two of Ronnie's kidnappers 
   break into their room. Ginger and Whitney are able to overpower them 
   (in a highly awkward fight sequence), but Ronnie kidnaps an Asian 
   ambassador that accompanied Whitney on his trip. With Ginger's cover 
   blown, Whitney spills the beans on the importance of the Asian trade 
   route info he has in his possession, which leads Ginger, Clay and 
   Whitney to the island of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, where 
   Ronnie has her base of operations. Whitney is easily kidnapped by 
   Ronnie's men (Ginger is really not such a great bodyguard), so Ginger 
   and Clay try to rescue him, but time and time again Ronnie gets the 
   upper hand, both physically and politically. In the finale, Ginger 
   gets her revenge by tying up Ronnie and having Whitney rape her, a 
   final going away present to remind Ronnie what she'll be missing for 
   the next twenty years she'll be spending behind bars!&nbsp; As an 
   action film, <B><A HREF="girls_are_for_loving_1973.htm">GIRLS ARE FOR LOVING</A></B> 
   is so bad, it's laughable. The fight scenes look like they were made 
   up on the spot, as they are terribly choreographed and executed. As 
   bad a singer as Ms. Caffaro is, it pales in comparison to her awful 
   martial arts moves. Thankfully, director/screenwriter Don Schain , 
   who also directed the first two Ginger films, as well as <B><A HREF="#PlaceCalledToday">A
    PLACE CALLED TODAY</A></B> (1972) and <B><A HREF="#TooHotToHandle">TOO
    HOT TO HANDLE</A></B> (1976), all starring Caffaro, had the good 
   sense to have Cheri Caffaro topless or totally naked during most of 
   her fight scenes. As a matter of fact, both Caffaro and Jocelyn 
   Peters (in her only feature film appearance) spend most of their 
   screen time either topless, naked or wearing the smallest amount of 
   clothing possible, which makes this film a treat for the eyes but not 
   the ears (You know a film is in trouble when the best acting comes 
   from 70's exploitation staple Timothy Brown!). Another plus in favor 
   of this film is the respect Ronnie shows for Ginger, giving the film 
   a rare pro-feminist viewpoint, unseen in most films of this type 
   except for blaxploitation films of the 70's with strong female 
   characters. Still, <B><A HREF="girls_are_for_loving_1973d.htm">GIRLS 
   ARE FOR LOVING</A></B> fails as an action film. Ginger tries to be a 
   female James Bond, but it's hard to copy someone when your budget is 
   less than one of Bond's shaken, not stirred, martinis. This is for 
   nudity fanatics only and while that not necessarily a bad thing, this 
   film could have been so much more with a little more attention paid 
   to the action sequences. Also starring Fred Vincent, Robert C.

   a mandatory MPAA-issued X-Rating slapped on the advertising

    ON THE ROAD</A><A NAME="GirlsOnTheRoad"></A> (1972) -</B> Two young 
   girls, Karen (Dianna Hull) and Debbie (Kathleen Cody), hit the 
   wide-open road in search of kicks, ignoring the fact that a serial 
   killer is murdering young women along the beach of California's Big 
   Sur. They rent a car, drive recklessly (a cop gives Karen a ticket 
   for throwing her bra out the window) and fuck with the heads of a

   Ontkean), who we see in the beginning of the film beating up two guys 
   playing pool in a bar for no reason at all, after having a flashback

   Will after telling him that the Army has done all they can). Will may

    friend John (Ralph Waite). John tells Will to ditch the Army uniform 
   (&quot;It's a false identity.&quot;) if he wants to stay at the 
   Institute. Karen and Debbie catch the eye of The Maker (John 
   McMurtry), a creepy Institute teacher and old Army buddy of Will's. 
   The trio then go to Debbie's parents' beach house, where a bunch of 
   hippies are squatting. One of them knocks out Will and they take off. 
   When Will comes to, he grabs his gun and goes after them. When 
   nighttime comes and Will doesn't return, Debbie and Karen go back to 
   the Institute looking for him. John returns with them to the beach 
   house, where they find a groggy Will waiting by the door. John 
   invites the girls to come back to the Institute in the morning and 
   walks back to the Institute. Karen goes by herself to the Institute 
   the next morning (She says, &quot;I feel loved!&quot; after the 
   encounter group lifts her up in the air in unison), while Will and 
   Debbie spend some alone time on the beach. That night, one of the 
   Institute's women, Frances (Pamela Serpe), is murdered. Karen takes 
   off her top and makes a play for Will, but he rebuffs her. Will 
   returns to the Institute, where The Maker accuses him of killing 
   Frances. We then find out who the killer really is, but stupid girls 
   Karen and Debbie shoot Will with his own gun. The killer (who has a 
   hatchet) meets the girls outside the beach house, we hear a shot and 
   then see a freeze-frame of the killer's face. The End.&nbsp; This 
   early 70's exploitation film, directed by Thomas J. Schmidt (his only 
   directorial effort; he died at age 35 in 1975), is a severely-dated 
   road movie full of long-haired hippies in bell bottom pants, hippies 
   in communes and hippies being hassled by the fuzz. There were so many 
   hippies, I nearly broke out the bug spray. Much of the film's 
   philosophies (free love, going braless, homosexuality) seem archaic 
   and simple-minded today as do the scenes of body painting and group 
   encounters (not to mention the &quot;far-out&quot; dialogue). 
   Scripters Michel Levesque (who also directed <B><A HREF="werewolves_on_wheels_1971.htm">WEREWOLVES
    ON WHEELS</A></B> [1971] and the WIP flick <B><A HREF="#SweetSugar">SWEET
    SUGAR</A></B> [1972]), Larry Bischof and Gloria Goldsmith have 
   crafted a story that spends way too much time on the commune life and 
   not enough time on the murder mystery. Once we get the reveal on who 
   the real killer is, it's way too late to care. Karen and Debbie care 
   nothing about anyone's feelings and cocktease every man they run 
   across, never putting out for anyone. I was hoping these two girls 
   would get abused in some way to teach them a lesson but, except for 
   the oblique ending, they do very much what they please and get away 
   with it. For a film about free love, there's precious little nudity 
   and there's even less blood. It also doesn't help that the sound is 
   out of synch for almost half the running time (a mastering problem on 
   the Unicorn VHS tape). This film is only of interest if you want to 
   see an early film appearance by Michael Ontkean (who would do TV's <B><A HREF="rookies_tv_1974.htm">THE
    ROOKIES</A></B> next) and watch Papa Walton himself, Ralph Waite, 
   sporting dashikis, spouting inane hippie psychobabble and trying to 
   get it on with Karen. It's not a pretty sight. Also starring Michael 
   Kopsche, Elizabeth Saxon, Paul Sorensen, Cliff Emmich and a

    GREAT HOLLYWOOD RAPE-SLAUGHTER</A><A NAME="GreatHollywoodRape"></A> 
   (1971/1974) -</B> Film school graduate Steve Ford (Michael Plamondon, 
   who also co-scripted) heads for Hollywood with his &quot;perfect&quot;
    script with hopes of hitting the big time. He puts an ad for work in 
   Variety and gets a response from Mr. Burns (John Dennis of <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Garden Dead">GARDEN
    OF THE DEAD</A></B> - 1972), a producer of porn (posters with titles 
   like <B><A HREF="wife_swappers_1970.htm">WIFE SWAPPERS</A> </B>and <B><A HREF="obscene_couch_1963.htm">THE
    OBSCENE COUCH</A></B> adorn his office walls). After showing Steve 
   some of the shitty porn films he is forced to make, Mr. Burns offers 
   Steve a chance to make &quot;classy shit&quot;, or porn films with a 
   sense of style and tells Steve that if this arrangement works out, he 
   will finance Steve's script. Steve watches as hack director Richards 
   (John Streck) makes a classless porn film (One girl eats M&amp;Ms 
   while being fucked!), so Steve tells Mr. Burns he'll make a porn film 
   for him as long as he has script approval and can hire his own 
   cameraman. Mr. Burns agrees, so Steve hires friend Charlie (Jay 
   Neale) to handle the camera and they both go to sleazy casting agent 
   Hammer (J. Streak) to hire four girls that can handle 
   &quot;dialogue&quot; and two guys that can &quot;act&quot;. When 
   Steve's wife Holly (Betty Jean Smith) finds out what kind of film 
   Steve is making, she's none too pleased and somewhat jealous. When 
   Steve and Charlie begin making their porno film, they find they have 
   to d<A HREF="great_hollywood_rape_slaughter_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/great hollywood rape slaughter ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="231" HEIGHT="262" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="2"></A>eal
    with tempermental actresses, time overages and hard luck stories 
   from the cast and crew (usually involving money). Steve slowly begins 
   to lose his mind when Holly leaves him and when he catches one of the 
   film's producers raping sixteen year-old porn star wannabe Giselle 
   (Sandra Golden) in a motel room. Steve goes to Mr. Burn's office and 
   tells him he quits (He says to Burns, &quot;You're a porno maker. 
   You'll never get any higher in this business than a woman's 
   crotch!&quot;). Burns flips out and hits Steve over the head with a 
   booze bottle, then he and his gun-toting associate kick the shit out 
   of Steve. In the films &quot;What The Fuck?&quot; finale, some beefy 
   musclebound guy in a <B><A HREF="billy_jack_1971.htm">BILLY JACK</A></B> 
   hat pulls up on a motorcycle to a motel room where an orgy is going 
   on, bursts through the door and kills everyone with a shotgun and a 
   six-shooter. He then straps the dead body of a girl to the back of 
   his motorcycle (after chastising her for getting an abortion!) and 
   rides away. The final shots reveals that this is nothing but a scene 
   from a movie that Steve is shooting, as we see the cameraman (an 
   early appearance by PM Entertainment co-founder Richard Pepin) giving 
   him the OK sign, the shot is in the can. Steve finally has hit the 
   big time (even though the guy playing &quot;Steve&quot; in this scene 
   is not Michael Plamondon!). This obscure softcore exploitation flick 
   purportedly shows what it was like to make an adult film. As someone 
   that worked behind the scenes of several porn films during the late 
   70's, I can say with certainty that this film has a modicum of truth 
   to it, but most of it is strictly fantasy. This film portrays 
   pornography films as a Producer's medium and that may be true, but I 
   never met a producer quite as giving and co-operative to an untested 
   director like Mr. Burns is here. He never talks money (at least 
   specific dollar amounts). Director/producer/co-scripter Charles 
   Edward (He later changed his name to &quot;Charles 
   Brosseau-Fisher&quot; and made a little-seen film called <B>FROZEN HOT</B> 
   in 1999, which has yet to find a distributor) shot this film under 
   the title <B>HARDCORE BLUES</B> in 1971, but got so pissed that 
   people said he looked like Billy Jack during the release of <B><A HREF="trial_of_billy_jack_1974.htm">THE
    TRIAL OF BILLY JACK</A></B> in 1974, that he shot the non-sensical 
   ending with himself playing &quot;Billy Jacki&quot; as a slap in the 
   face to the late Tom Laughlin, seems to imply that porn films are a 
   necessary means to an end. Steve, just like nearly every film school 
   grad, has written the perfect script, but can't get anyone to read it 
   because he also insists on directing it, too. So, Steve bites the 
   bullet and agrees to direct a hardcore porn film and, even though he 
   loses his wife and gets beaten up, he still manages to make his dream 
   movie in the end (I'm surprised Tom Laughlin didn't sue, because 
   Charles Edwards at the end looks the spitting image of <B><A HREF="born_losers_1967.htm">BILLY
    JACK</A></B> and one female character even calls him Billy!). The 
   sentiment is a little naive, but it gets it's point across thanks to 
   the final shot. The short (61 minute) ultra-low-budget film is full 
   of both male and female full frontal nudity, but nothing that 
   approaches hardcore and contains one head-scratching scene where 
   Steve and Charlie are filming a guy in a fake moustache (actually 
   star Michael Plamondon), fucking a woman while wearing a top hat that 
   has &quot;<B><A HREF="super_ball_1971.htm">SUPER BALL</A></B>&quot; 
   (the film's alternate title) written on it. As he holds a woman's 
   legs apart with her vagina close to his face, all we hear on the 
   soundtrack is a woman whispering, &quot;Super Ball! Super Ball!&quot; 
   over and over. I'm still trying to figure that one out. The violence 
   in this film is tame (the slaughter scene at the end never shows 
   anyone directly getting shot, except when Bill shoots an injured man 
   in the head after he props his body on a woman to simulate sex) and 
   the music is by The Rings, who sing of the &quot;Lowdown Hardcore 
   Blues&quot;. Only of interest to those that like obscure softcore 
   flicks with a little (very little) violence thrown in. The acting is 
   not that bad, though. Also starring Clay Hollister, Ron Darby, Gwen 
   Tanney, Karen Sonjohn, Nancy Woods and Sue Marlino (and, no, singer 
   Linda Ronstadt is nowhere to be found here, no matter what the ad 
   mats say). An <A HREF="http://www.alphabluearchives.com">Alpha Blue Archives</A>

   (1975) -</B> Candy Morgan (Claudia Jennings) breaks out of prison and 
   the first thing she does is hold up the Alpine Bank by walking in 
   holding a lit stick of dynamite. Just-fired bank teller Ellie-Jo 
   Turner (Jocelyn Jones) gives Candy all the bank's money and becomes 
   excited by the experience. After Candy hands over all the stolen loot 
   to her father to save the family farm, she hightails it out of town, 
   where she picks up a hitch-hiking Ellie-Jo. They hit it off 
   immediately and Ellie-Jo convinces Candy to hold up another bank 
   using dynamite. Their first attempt is disasterous, as the sticks of 
   dynamite they use turn out to be duds, which leads to a car chase 
   with the police. After blowing up a police car with their last good 
   stick of dynamite, the girls get away and look for a place to buy

    who gives them a crate of TNT and a shotgun after Candy screws him 
   (and tells him the truth). Their next bank job goes off without a 
   hitch (it's pretty ingenious, actually), even though they get pulled 
   over for speeding on the outskirts of town (what Candy and Ellie-Jo 
   do to the cop is quite funny). After reading in the papers that they 
   are also wanted on trumped-up charges of killing a bank teller, they 
   decide to get even by robbing the next bank they run across (It's the 
   New World Bank, a tip of the hat to New World Pictures, who 
   distributed this.). Finding that the bank is closed (because they 
   crossed into a different time zone), they go to a grocery store where 
   Ellie-Jo is caught shoplifting, forcing the girls to take Slim 
   (Johnny Crawford) hostage in order to make their escape. Slim quickly 
   becomes a part of the gang (and love interest for Ellie-Jo), first as 
   a &quot;hostage&quot; in the bank holdups and later as an active 
   participant. Things take a serious turn when Slim is shot and killed 
   by two policemen when he and Ellie-Jo are having a picnic, forcing 
   Candy to kill the two cops. Candy and Ellie-Jo pull off one last bank 
   job, but it turns out to be a police setup. Candy is shot and wounded 
   during the getaway. The last we see the duo, they are on horseback, 
   crossing the border into Mexico.&nbsp; This is classic 70's 
   exploitation all the way, thanks to the constant nudity of Jocelyn

   amounts. As always, Claudia Jennings (who died much too young in a 
   tragic car accident in 1979) proves to be a good actress, both in and 
   out of clothes. Her chemistry with co-star Jones (they look enough 
   alike to be sisters) is near-perfect and both make a believable team

    and Top 40 musician [1962's &quot;Cindy's Birthday&quot;]) is also 
   spot-on, which only makes it all the more disturbing for the audience 
   when he is killed. The radical shift from comedy to tragedy late in 
   the film throws the viewer for a loop and, while the screenplay (by 
   David Kirkpatrick) may seem broad at times (the fancy hotel scene 
   panders to every schoolboy's fantasy of a threesome in a bathtub), it 
   is very entertaining. While the ending is a little abrupt for my 
   liking (on-screen text tells us both of their fates), what transpires 
   before it is pure 70's drive-in entertainment at it's finest. Films

    WHAT HAPPENED TO COUNT DRACULA?</A><A NAME="GuessWhatCountDracu"></A> 
   (1969) -</B> What a ridiculously weird and cheap film. Vampire Count 
   Adrian (Des Roberts, who also composed the film's music score) runs 
   an underground nightclub in his castle called Dracula's Dungeon (the 
   nightclub is only accessible by asking the &quot;Sacred Owl&quot; for 
   entrance, where a hidden bookcase door opens to allow entry). Count 
   Adrian has his eye on new customer Angelica (Claudia Barron), but her 
   boyfriend Guy (John Landon) never leaves her side. Angelica senses 
   something is wrong (&quot;It's like I'm being drawn to a 
   coffin!&quot;), so Guy reluctantly takes her home (&quot;You're 
   acting like a child. You ruined the whole evening!&quot;). Count 
   Adrian follows Angelica and Guy back to her pad and, after checking 
   for boogey men under her bed, Guy leaves and almost immediately Count 
   Adrian materializes in her home. Angelica faints and the Count puts 
   the bite on her. Angelica goes to Dr. Harris (Roger Branche), who 
   tells her that's she's anemic and jokingly says to have her boyfriend 
   quit biting her on the neck during sex play. He playfully remarks 
   that the puncture <A HREF="guess_what_happened_to_count_dracula_1969.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/guess what happened to count dracula ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>marks
    on her neck look like a vampire attack and, from that moment on, 
   Angelica becomes obsessed with vampires. Count Adrian (who we find 
   out is the son of Count Dracula) is having somewhat of an internal 
   struggle in his castle with his manservant Igor (Danny Lester) and 
   they have a battle of psychic wills (insert cheap opticals here), 
   where Igor loses and ends up caged like an animal. Angelica's friends 
   invade her home for an impromptu party and Count Adrian shows up. 
   Angelica complains that she has a severe migraine, so Adrian 
   hypnotizes her with a medallion he wears around his neck and her 
   migraine goes away. Angelica and Adrian hit it off (he mentions 
   &quot;necrophilia&quot;, but she's never heard of the word before) 
   and she invites him over the next night for a juicy steak dinner for 
   two. Later that night, Angelica has a bad nightmare involving rats 
   and running down an endless corridor, right after she looks up 
   &quot;necrophilia&quot; in the dictionary and goes, &quot;Ewwww!&quot;
    The Count returns that night and bites her neck once again, but not 
   before telling her that she will be her bride and live forever. Guy 
   becomes worried when he notices Angelica's pale skin, her aversion to 
   sunlight, her appetite for raw meat and her fear of the crucifix he 
   wears around his neck. Can Guy and Dr. Harris save Angelica in time 
   before she becomes Count Adrian's eternal vampire bride? Does she 
   even want to be saved? A surprise reveal in the finale proves Guy is 
   not the good guy he was pretending to be.&nbsp; This ultra-low-budget 
   horror comedy, directed, produced and written by Laurence Merrick (<B><A HREF="black_angels_1970.htm">BLACK
    ANGELS</A></B> - 1970 [also starring Des Roberts]; <B><A HREF="manson_1973.htm">MANSON</A></B> 
   - 1973), has the production values and acting talent of a porn film 
   of the time period. It should come as no surprise then to learn that 
   this is a PG-rated edit (which would explain some of the jump cuts 
   here) of a far more sexually explicit film titled <B>DOES DRACULA 
   REALLY SUCK?</B>, which also contained more violence and, 
   unfortunately, seems to be a lost film. It was also edited into a gay 
   feature called <B>DRACULA AND THE BOYS</B> (which also seems to be 
   lost). The PG edit still contains enough weirdness to keep the viewer 
   entertained, including Des Roberts' portrayal of Count Adrian (who 
   looks like Abraham Lincoln, if Lincoln were a vampire!), who slips in 
   and out of his Bela Lugosi accent so often, it can't be accidental; a 
   voodoo ceremony where someone eats a (obviously rubber) lizard 
   (&quot;I have eaten the lizard! I am the lizard! Macumba!&quot;); a 
   gorilla in a cage; a real pet tiger; a cackling old hag tarot card 
   reader; and a head-scratchingly funny scene where Dr. Harris and his 
   nurse throw double-entendres at each other (&quot;Do you wanna do it 
   on my desk?&quot;), only to reveal that they are about to play a game 
   of chess (I'm sure that scene played a lot differently in the 
   sexually explicit version!). I must say that I enjoyed this little 
   slice of cheese more than I should have, but it is just funny, 
   strange and short enough (78 minutes) to hold interest. The opening 
   and closing credits are written in an old book with flipping pages.

   stealing food) and when they try to escape, they are whipped in front 
   of everyone else as a warning. As the Reverend's behavior grows more 
   bizarre (thanks to his addiction to painkillers) and his punishments 
   grow more severe (he forces one teen boy to have sex with a man when 
   he is caught having sex with a teen girl), the U.S. government sends 
   a convoy of politicians and reporters, including Congressman Lee 
   O'Brien (Gene Barry; <B><A HREF="war_of_the_worlds_1953.htm">WAR OF 
   THE WORLDS</A></B> - 1953), to make sure that the people of 
   Johnsontown are being treated properly and not being held by force. 
   This leads to a massacre of the reporters when Johnson doesn't 
   believe Congressman O'Brien and his entourage have fallen for the 
   ruse (Johnson dresses his flock in new clothes and makes sure plenty 
   of healthy food is on view, a stark contrast of what is really going 
   on there). When news of the massacre reaches the outside world, 
   Johnson sees no other recourse than to have his entire congregation 
   drink cyanide-laced Kool-Aid (those that refuse are forced to drink 
   or shot), which leads to one of the largest mass suicides in modern 
   history and one of the most horrific examples of religious zealotry 
   ever witnessed by human eyes.&nbsp; Titled <B><A HREF="guyana_cult_of_the_damned_1979.htm">GUYANA:
    CULT OF THE DAMNED</A></B> when released to theaters in the U.S. by 
   Universal Studios and edited down to a 90 minute R-rated edition from 
   its original 114 minute cut (to tighten the narrative and remove some 
   of the more seedier aspects of the film), the version released by VCI 
   Entertainment on DVD is a longer edit (107 minutes), but is still 
   missing some of the more extreme bits of violence (While this version 
   restores some of the footage of the three young children being 
   tortured [by snakes, drowning and spikes], it omits most of the 
   blood). Director/producer Rene Cardona Jr., who co-wrote the 
   screenplay with Carlos Valdemar (Cardona Jr.'s <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Cyclone1978">CYCLONE</A></B> 
   - 1978), manages to touch on most of the widely known facts about Jim 
   Jones and Jonestown, but takes many liberties with the true story 
   (especially when it comes to what the reporters uncover on their 
   visit to Johnsontown and Johnson's punishment of the unfaithful). 
   While Stuart Whitman is appropriately sleazy as Johnson (it is one of 
   his best roles in the latter part of his career) and the film manages 
   to entertain on a b-level, if you really want to view an effective 
   retelling of the Jonestown massacre and the events that led up to it, 
   try watching the two-part 1980 miniseries <B><A HREF="guyana_tragedy_the_story_of_jim_jones_1980.htm">THE

   film is nothing but cheap exploitation fare that was quickly 
   churned-out to cash-in on the then-recent events, while it was still 
   fresh on everyone's mind. Also starring John Ireland, Joseph Cotten, 
   Bradford Dillman, Yvonne DeCarlo, Jennifer Ashley, Nadiuska, Tony

   a blaxploitation flick that makes any film starring Rudy Ray Moore 
   look like high-end entertainment. Former Harlem detective Al Connors 
   (Loye Hawkins) is now a Miami-based private dick. He is visited by 
   old CIA buddy David McLeod (Vaughn Harris) and partner Paul Benson 
   (Michael Murrell), who want Al to babysit Mrs. Ashanti (Patricia 
   Fulton), the wife of an important African diplomat visiting Miami on 
   business. Al and Mrs. Ashanti register as husband and wife at a ritzy 
   hotel and Mrs. Ashanti complains that she has an achy back, so Al 
   calls for a masseuse. A female masseuse shows up a short time later, 
   but it's obvious to Al (and us) that the masseuse is working for the 
   bad guys, who want to kidnap Mrs. Ashanti for ransom.. Fortunately, 
   she doesn't get the chance to drug Mrs. Ashanti, thanks to Al keeping 
   a close eye on her. When the masseuse reluctantly leaves, Al orders 
   room service (&quot;Send up two New York strip steaks.&quot;) and 
   puts the moves on Mrs. Ashanti (She says, &quot;Just because I'm 
   bored doesn't mean I'm hot to trot!&quot;). After knocking out a 
   transvestite pretending to deliver the room service (Mrs. Ashanti 
   asks Al how he knew the room service girl was a guy, he responds, 
   &quot;I know what a New York strip steak smells like and he didn't

    the front door (a hilariously-bad martial arts fight), Al learns 
   that white man Big Daddy (Scott Lawrence) wants to kidnap Mrs. 
   Ashanti. They move out of the hotel and into the apartment of Al's 
   part-time white girlfriend, JoAnn (Angela Schon), where Al kicks 
   JoAnn out of the apartment and then seduces Mrs. Ashanti. The next 
   morning, Al turns Mrs. Ashanti over to the CIA and returns to his 
   office, where he is visited by Harry DeBauld (Steve Gallon, a.k.a. 
   &quot;Wildman Steve&quot;) and his son Larry (Laster Wilson), who 
   want Al to to rescue their kidnapped daughter/sister Wanda (Cathy 
   Davis). Al agrees to deliver the ransom, which includes $500,000 in 
   cocaine and $250,000 in cash, when he learns that the person 
   responsible for Wanda's kidnapping is none other than Big Daddy. Al 
   eventually rescues Wanda, but, surprisingly, she doesn't want to go 
   home. Where does he bring her? That's right, to JoAnn's apartment! 
   After kicking JoAnn out of her own apartment once again, Al makes 
   sweet love to Wanda, delivers her to her daddy and then has a final 
   confrontation with Big Daddy and his henchman Jim (Richie Vallon), 
   where he answers Big Daddy's question: &quot;Is it true that niggers 
   are like dogs, they fight in packs? I want a piece of your ass, if 
   you're not a dog!&quot; Al kills Big Daddy in a no-holds-barred fight 
   (at least I think it's no-holds-barred, it's just hard to tell), 
   thereby saving the world from another white trash piece of kidnapping 
   scum. Now, if he would just do something about all those lousy 
   Cubans!&nbsp; Impossibly shoddy in nearly every department, from 
   threadbare sets, chainsaw editing, fights that look to have been 
   choreographed by a blind man and, most of all, acting from a troupe 
   of low-talent thespians that not only constantly flub their lines, 
   they also step on everyone else's (you can practically see footprints 
   on the actors' tongues), <B>THE GUY FROM HARLEM</B> is one of those 
   rare films where all the bad stuff comes together and produces a film 
   that's totally watchable in a train wreck sort of way. The production 
   values never rise above that of a 70's porn feature (it may actually 
   be a step down) and neither does the acting , but some of the 
   dialogue and situations are priceless. My favorite scene comes when 
   Matt, one of the white kidnappers, tells Wanda that her Afro feels 
   like pubic hair and then unzips his fly and sticks his dick in her 
   face (we see everything from Matt's back, so we actually see nothing) 
   and Wanda's reply of, &quot;Man, get your ass outta my face!&quot; 
   had me rolling on the floor with laughter (Wanda, my dear, that's not 
   his ass in your face!). Director Rene Martinez Jr., who also made the

   bothered with second takes (my guess is that there's not a wasted 
   frame in the whole film) and sister Gardenia Martinez's screenplay 
   contains way too much overblown dialogue, but <B>THE GUY FROM HARLEM</B>

   its' scant 65 minute running time on travelogue footage of London. 
   The rest of the film is filled with the worst acting and simulated 
   sex that you can imagine. Even though both male and female full 
   frontal nudity is on display, the sex scenes leave a lot to be 
   desired. Fellatio is performed on flaccid dicks. Would your dick be 
   as limp if you were getting oral sex? I think not. Another 
   distraction is the actress (?) portraying the college student. She 
   has such a tremendous overbite that you could hide a Buick Roadmaster 
   in her mouth. There are other signs of trouble: Voiceover narration 
   (probably to hide the fact that no one could handle a speaking part) 
   and no title or end credits. There is some camp value (the 70's 
   fashions and hair styles) but by no means is this good viewing.

   the only way to settle the matter is to have Billy and Mark race each

   is an amiable tale about drag racing and the family atmosphere 
   surrounding the Hi-Riders (Hell, even Billy turns out to be a

   director/screenwriter Greydon Clark ladles on the blood and violence 
   as the bad guys (who all drive beat-up pickup trucks) try to kill 
   T.J. and the remaining trio. You can tell Clark blew most of the 
   film's paltry budget on the final thirty minutes, as trucks and 
   people fly through the air (in super-slow-motion), fall off bridges 
   or end up in fiery crashes. Clark also fills the film with plenty of 
   female nudity, sex and car chases, making this a perfect night of

   been made in the 70's. So sit back, relax, put your brain in neutral

   him and Harvey and his gang of bikers spoil some shots by riding 
   their motorcycles into camera range. The bikers then steal equipment

   profitable. Harvey tries to kidnap Rafe's girlfriend Julie (Mary 
   Woronov), but Rafe beats the crap out of Harvey and Rhodes, saving 
   her. The crooked sheriff (Tom Simcox) arrests Rafe, but Rafe 
   sweet-talks him into letting him finish the film. The delusional

   up with more papers for Rafe to sign, which Rafe does after having 
   his life threatened. Harvey kills Rafe's stunt double, Barney (Don 
   Stroud), and pins down the crew with sniper fire. Rafe turns the 
   camera on Harvey and films himself killing Rhodes and the sheriff 
   killing Harvey. Rafe finishes the film, but the shocking conclusion

   Harvey goes off the deep end and murders all his cohorts (including

   The unexpected finale is also an eye-opener. I won't spoil it for

   Republic of San Rosario, three young boys are frolicking naked in a

   the young boy dies and his father, Flavio (Carmen Argenziano; <B><A HREF="action.htm#FightingMad1978">FIGHTING

   hospital just down the road, a full medical staff saves the young son 
   of the country's Minister of Defense, the same operation Flavio's son 
   needed to stay alive. Yes, the Republic of San Rosario has two 
   classes: the rich and influential who can get what is needed to save 
   lives and the poor, hard-working citizens, who can't <A HREF="hot_box_1972b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hot box vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="171" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>afford
    to save their family's lives. Something tells me a change is gonna 
   come. Flavio becomes a revolutionary and begins killing soldiers and 
   military officials with a loyal band of friends. Four American women, 
   Bunny (Andrea Kagan), Lynn (Margaret Markov; <B><A HREF="#Arena1973">THE
    ARENA</A></B> - 1973), Ellie (Rickey Richardson) and Sue (Laurie 
   Rose: <B><A HREF="#WomanHunt1972">THE WOMAN HUNT</A></B> - 1972) are 
   picnicing on the beach with their four Filipino boyfriends when they 
   are captured by land raiders and led off into the jungle (their 
   boyfriends are tied to their boat and set adrift). Flavio pays the 
   land raiders for the four women (just before one of them tries to 
   rape Lynn) and we then find out that these four women are actually 
   volunteer nurses sent to San Rosario to work in the cushy hospitals. 
   Flavio will have none of that and makes the women tend to the poor 
   villagers and injured freedom fighters. At first the women are 
   reticent to help, but once they see the deplorable, dirty conditions 
   the villagers live in, they quickly change their minds (but not 
   before stealing a truck and unsuccessfully making a run for it) and 
   begin making a difference by opening a dispensary and teaching the 
   villagers basic medical procedures. Flavio and his men steal the 
   medical supplies the girls need and Lynn agrees to go on a raid to 
   make sure they steal the right supplies. After seeing the deplorable 
   condition of the hospital they are robbing (they have no medical 
   supplies to steal!), Lynn opens her eyes and becomes a believer in 
   Flavio's plight, falling in love with his second-in-command Ronaldo 
   (Zaldy Zshornack) and going with him on a much more dangerous raid at 
   an Army base, where there are plenty of medical supplies and weapons 
   (the ensuing firefight is well-done and bloody as hell). Flavio and 
   Ellie become lovers (Ellie is black and equates her racial troubles 
   back in the States with Flavio's plight), but Ronaldo believes that 
   Flavio is running the revolution in the wrong way, which leads to 
   internal strife. Ronaldo leaves the camp and agrees to take the four 
   women to freedom, but they are captured by Major Dubay (Charles 
   Dierkop; a regular on the 70's TV series <B><A HREF="police_woman_tv_series_1974-1978.htm">POLICE
    WOMAN</A></B> [1974 - 1978]), a despicable military man/rapist who 
   pretended to be a photojournalist named &quot;Garcia&quot; earlier in 
   the film to get the skinny on Flavio's operation. While Major Dubay 
   is raping Sue in his office, the other girls are put in a cage (the 
   &quot;hot box&quot; of the film's title) and forced to strip in front 
   of all the soldiers. The girls escape with Ronaldo's help and head 
   back to Flavio's camp to warn him of Major Dubay's upcoming assault. 
   Will the girls make it in time and will Flavio's vision come 
   true?&nbsp; For those expecting a Women In Prison (WIP) flick, they 
   are in for a huge surprise. Director/co-screenwriter Joe Viola (<B><A HREF="angels_as_hard_as_they_come_1971.htm">ANGELS

   the women, men and children. Try getting away with that today!), 
   violence and just the right amount of 70's politics and, wouldn't you 
   know it, it works better than it has any right to, thanks to decent 
   acting by a cast of pros, some good action sequences full of bloody 
   bullet squibs, crossbow bolt impalements, knifings, explosions and 
   plenty of stunts. What I particularly liked about this film is that 
   even though Flavio is meant to be the hero of this film, he's one of 
   the most unlikeable heroes you're ever likely to meet. He slaps the 
   women around, treats his men like shit and threatens to court martial 
   Ronaldo when the final battle is over. This Philippines-lensed 
   feature has everything you could ask for in a 70's drive-in 
   exploitation film: Plenty of pretty naked ladies; bloody violence; 
   and a story that is not hard to follow, but it's not simple or 
   dumbed-down. I recommend <B><A HREF="hot_box_1972.htm">THE HOT BOX</A></B>

   do with demonic possession, even though there is a scene of <I>supposed</I> 
   demonic possession in the film. It has a few exploitable elements, so 
   the best place to put it was here. But don't think this is any way an 
   exploitation film. It is actually a serious indictment on how Spain 
   dealt with people who had mental problems at the turn of the 
   Twentieth Century. The film opens up at a female mental institution, 
   where conditions are, simply put, horrendous. We see women dressed in 
   filthy clothes, their hair matted and dirty, their skin covered with 
   grime and fecal matter and the living conditions are horrible (some 
   of the more seriously disturbed patients are kept in cages with no 
   beds). Believe it or not, the nurses are actually nuns, who haven't 
   the slightest idea how to take care of the mentally handicapped so, 
   when they act up, they are strapped into wicker baskets and dunked 
   into a well filled with cold water. A new doctor, Rafael Alba 
   (Espartaco Santoni; <B><A HREF="violent_blood_bath_1973.htm">VIOLENT 
   BLOOD BATH</A></B> - 1973), is hired to oversee the asylum and he has 
   new ideas on how to approve the conditions. First, he announces that 
   &quot;This is the end of the era of straitjackets&quot; and says that 
   treating people like actual human beings is much better that treating 
   them as animals. But before any of this can be achieved, he must have 
   to deal with the asylum's cruel male guard, Puzo (Francisco Rabal; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#City Walking Dead">CITY
    OF THE WALKING DEAD</A></B> - 1980), who has to get drunk every 
   morning just to come to work (there's a scene in the beginning of the 
   film where Puzo is drinking in an attic and he watches a cat catch a 
   rat and eat it, a suitable analogy for Puzo's life). Puzo is a 
   literal sadist, a tortured soul who is worse off than the patients he 
   oversees, who gets off abusing the female patients (both physically 
   and sexually) while the women look at him as they would a rabid dog 
   (one obese female patient pours the contents of her bedpan on the 
   floor when he passes her). He also sells the prettier inmates nightly 
   to stranger for sex, basically acting like their pimp (only he gets 
   to keep all the cash), and he finds particular joy in tormenting the 
   patients by slapping them around or hosing them down while calling 
   them &quot;idiots&quot; and &quot;loons&quot;. The first time Dr. 
   Alba confronts Puzo, Puzo tells him, &quot;This hellhole is a 
   cemetery and these idiots are all dead&quot;. Dr. Alba begins shaking 
   things up in the asylum, disrupting the status quo, including Puzo's 
   brutal treatment of the patients. Dr. Alba is a man of science, who 
   begins treating the inmates as human beings and not disposable 
   property, first by giving them proper haircuts, cleaning them up and 
   letting them go outside every day to escape the filth and stink that 
   is inside (which he also begins cleaning up). He wins the inmates 
   faith, but his methods anger the asylum's Board of Trustees, who 
   don't like what Dr. Alba is doing because it is costing them money 
   which would otherwise fill their pockets (the more crazy people they 
   have, the more money the country gives to them). They don't want any 
   of these people &quot;cured&quot; because it will hit them in their 
   pocketbooks. Puzo now actually has to treat the inmates with respect, 
   as Dr. Alba orders him to stay sober while he is on the job, 
   something which doesn't go over too well with him. Dr. Alba becomes 
   very interested with a patient called Tania (Anal&iacute;a 
   Gad&eacute;; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#MurderMansion1972">THE 
   MURDER MANSION</A></B> - 1972; she was married to Espartaco Santoni 
   when this film was made), who has lost her memory and can't remember 
   anything about her life. He thinks he can cure her with a new 
   scientific method called &quot;hypnosis&quot;. He gives a 
   demonstration of hypnosis to the Board of Trustees, who are not happy 
   that this method may be able to cure patients. They would&nbsp; 
   rather put their trust in religion and leave it to God to cure them 
   (at least thay is what they say, but Dr. Alba knows what their real 
   motivation is: money) and when one of the Trustee members questions 
   Dr. Alba on why they never see him in church on Sundays, he retorts, 
   &quot;I study science, sir, not sorcery!&quot;, putting all the 
   members in their place (One female board member [played by Maria 
   Asquerino] tries several times to get Dr. Alba to move out of the 
   asylum and live with her in her mansion so she can have sex with him, 
   but every time she asks, he turns down her advances, which will one 
   day come back to bite him in the ass). Dr. Alba knows he has to tread 
   lightly, because his only friend on the Board (Jos&eacute; 
   Viv&oacute;; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#PanicBeats1983">PANIC BEATS</A></B> 
   - 1983; the one who hired him) explains to him that change doesn't go 
   over well with his fellow Board members, but his interest in curing 
   Tania is so strong, he ends up spending more time with her than any 
   other patient. During one of their hypnosis sessions, Dr. Alba breaks 
   the wall in Tania's memory and learns why Tania was admitted to the 
   asylum at such a young age. When Tania was a child, she witnessed her 
   mother acting strange, twitching on the floor. A bunch of nuns gather 
   around her in a circle and say in unison, &quot;We have come to take 
   your mother. She has had devils inside her body for six years. Only a 
   miracle can save her. Make her drink the holy water!&quot; Young 
   Tania (portrayed by Inma de Santis) watches as her mother dies on the 
   floor, thinking for all these years that her mother was demonically 
   possessed and that she, one day, wiil be, too, to the point of 
   blocking her whole life from her memory. When Dr. Alba tells Tania 
   that her mother wasn't demonically possessed, but probably suffered 
   from epilepsy, which gave her seizures that the nuns mistakenly 
   believed was demonic possession, Tania breaks free of her mind's 
   chains and is cured. Just as Dr. Alba is about to release her from 
   the asylum for good (they have also become lovers, too), he gets word 
   that he has been fired and must leave the premises immediately, never 
   to come back (It turns out the female Board member was tired of him 
   turning down her advances and got the majority of the rest of the 
   Board to fire him). This means that Tania must stay in the asylum, 
   even though she has been cured. Things go back to &quot;normal&quot; 
   at the asylum, where a drunk Puzo can now go back to his brutal ways, 
   while Tania sits on the floor of a solitary confinement cell, trying 
   to keep sane by hearing the last words Dr. Alba said to her: 
   &quot;Hold on. I will return.&quot; Does he? We never find out. All 
   we see is Tania sitting on the cold stone floor, her arms around her 
   knees while &quot;THE END&quot; appears on-screen. Sometimes life 
   isn't fair.&nbsp; As an exploitation film, this <A HREF="exorcisms_daughter_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/exorcism's daughter aka house of insane women poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="207" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>fails
    miserably, but it was never meant to be one. Like I said earlier in 
   the review, this is actually a drama, an indictment about how 
   religion always trumped rational or scientific thought, even it it 
   meant people with mental problems suffered worse than an abused dog. 
   It also shows how religion made people rich back in the days when 
   science was just coming to the forefront, scoffing at the thought 
   that man could do something that God couldn't: Actually help the 
   mentally handicapped. Director/writer Rafael Morena Alba (who only 
   directed a handful of films, including the crime thriller <B><A HREF="triangle_1972.htm">TRIANGLE</A></B> 
   [1972] and the 1984 biographical Spanish mini-series <B><A HREF="court_martial_of_maria_pineda_1984.htm">THE

    before passing away in 2000) succeeds in spades when it come to 
   displaying that aspect and that is all he was trying to do. If people 
   felt cheated when they went to see it in theaters, they should have 
   blamed the distribution companies for their outrageous ad campaigns. 
   But if you watch the film for what is was actually trying to convey, 
   you should be satisfied. Nothing more and nothing less. The whole 
   &quot;exorcism&quot; angle only takes up about three minutes of 
   screen time and it's not actually an exorcism at all, but the way 
   religion treated valid medical conditions by putting faith in God 
   rather than giving them medication. It still amazes me today that 
   some religions still believe in this practice, saying &quot;God will 
   cure my children, not medical attention.&quot; and nearly every time 
   they die, but they still put their faith in religion, making lame 
   excuses like &quot;God must have had a plan for them in Heaven.&quot; 
   That is all this film is trying to put forth to audiences. Spain was 
   no different during the turn of the Twentieth Century than it was in 
   the Dark Ages when it came to medicine and religion (and some could 
   take it as a then [1971] modern-day parable about the Franco Regime). 
   While there is some full-frontal nudity and lesbian activity 
   (surprising for a Spanish film made during this period when sex and 
   nudity on screen was a no-no, but this was probably the International 
   Version; the version shown in Spain probably had the women clothed), 
   it is not titillating in the least. If you are in the mood for 
   something different, by all means watch this. If you think that you 
   will be watching a horror or &quot;Women In Prison&quot; film, you 
   will be bitterly disappointed. Look for Spanish staple Helga

   nude doing the latest craze called &quot;The Scrub&quot;, he follows

   for a night. He goes to a doctor to describe his problems and the doc 
   tries to convince him to go to a psychiatric clinic. &quot;I ain't

   neighbor Kandy Kane (Kelly Ross) reports her missing to police 
   detective Lt. Scott (Scott Brady, who has very little to do here 
   besides looking concerned) and gives him a description of Rick. When 
   the frozen Brit's corpse accidentally slides down the ice chute and 
   Jan Wilson (Nancy Dow) spots her body he tries to tell her that it 
   was a pratical joke by one of the employees. She comes on to him and 
   (yep) he strangles her and adds another body to the ice house. When 
   Kandy Kane spots him at the nude dance club, she calls Lt. Scott who 
   tells her to try to keep him there until the police arrive. He again 
   halucinates, tries to strangle her but is unsuccessful thanks to the 
   club's owner (Jim Davis, who also has very little to do besides 
   looking concerned) and some bouncers. He escapes on a motorcycle and 
   a chase with the police and a motorcycle gang ensues (a hilarious 
   sped-up fiasco). When Kandy gives a description to a surprised Fred 
   (&quot;He looks just like you!&quot;), he knows his brother is the 
   killer. He goes to the ice house where Fred finds the frozen corpses 
   and Rick, who accidentally kills Fred and takes his brother's place. 
   &quot;Fred&quot; resigns from the police force and takes over the ice 
   house, free to continue his murderous ways. This relic from the 60's 
   is highly watchable, due to the constant nude scenes (it was rated a

   of the film, when Fred gets caught at a swinger's party that has gone

   - 1979]), plenty of nudity and a great sense of humor. A government 
   agent (Big Bill Smith) is sent to a small town to investigate the 
   death of a prominent scientist who was working on a top secret 
   research project. Within a short period of time, over a dozen male 
   townies and scientists at the nearby Brandt Institute are dead from 
   the same cause. It seems they all have died of massive heart attacks 
   after balling their brains out! Bill's investigation leads him to 
   discover that this little town is a hotbed of sexual activity.

   and other assorted sexual goings-on are as commonplace as taking out 
   the garbage. Somehow, this is all tied to the experiments taking 
   place at the Brandt Institute and Bill means to find the connection. 
   Together with his newfound scientist girlfriend Julie (Victoria 
   Vetri, whom he saves from an attempted gang rape), Bill find his 
   connection in Dr. Susan Harris (Anitra Ford). Dr. Harris is 
   irradiating female town members with bee genes, turning them into 
   black-eyed sexual dynamos with a penchant for sweets and a desire to 
   fuck their mates to death. Dr. Harris kidnaps Julie, hoping to turn 
   her into the newest bee girl. Bill rushes in to save the day, 
   destroying Dr. Harris' bee machine and putting an end to the sexual 
   menace. The town is now safe to enjoy kinky sex without the deadly 
   repercussions. Extremely erotic (due much to genre vet </FONT><A HREF="gary graver.htm#Gary Graver"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Gary

   excellent photography), this film should be on every exploitation 
   fan's must-see list. It contains just the right amount of nudity (all 
   the women, including a cameo appearance by porno queen Rene Bond, 
   look great disrobed), humor and, most of all, a good storyline to 
   keep the film moving at a brisk pace. The screenplay pokes fun at a 
   lot of issues, including: small town morals, sexual repression, mob 
   mentality and government intervention. While there's not much blood 
   on view (it's not really called for here) there is a disturbing shot 
   of a man being run over by a car and a fist fight. The real meat of 
   the story deals with the sexual morals of the time (the early 70's)

    Bobbylee (Robin Haden) are on a boating vacation with their older 
   sisters and boyfriends, when they stop at an island for a little 
   scuba diving. They meet a boy named Jimmer (Stanley Wells), who is 
   wearing the same coin necklace as the adult Bobbylee. He tells the 
   group about a hidden treasure whose location is only known about by 
   his strict religious grandfather Jebediah (Hank Worden) and weirdo 
   Granny (Mitzi Stollery). Meanwhile, back in the present day, Sid 
   makes Sugar and Bobbylee retrace their steps back on the island, with 
   Willie and Repo tagging along as muscle. Back in 1983, our intrepid 
   group are invited to Jebediah's mountain cabin, where Granny serves 
   them drugged herbal tea, knocking out the two older sisters and one 
   of the boyfriends. Only Todd (Ed McClarty), Sugar and Bobbylee are 
   left to their own devices when a series of tremors rock the island. 
   The drugged older sisters and boyfriend wake up in a locked shed and 
   discover a secret room under the floor, only to find themselves 
   murdered and cut-up into slabs of meat. Yes, that's right, Jebediah 
   and his clan are cannibals, eating the flesh of any wayward tourists 
   who stumble on their island. While Todd tries to deal with Jebediah 
   armed only with a speargun, Jebediah sends his hulking retarded son 
   Junior (Jonathan Gravish) to grab the two young girls. As you can 
   probably guess, nothing turns out the way it's planned, as Sugar and 
   Bobbylee find the lifeless bodies of their sisters hanging in a meat 
   locker, Bobbylee is captured and used at bait to flush-out Todd and 
   Sugar and Jimmer turns against his grandpappy to save the young 
   girls. Past collides with present when the adult Sugar and Bobbylee 
   run into the adult Jimmer (Ross Hamilton) and he ends up saving one 
   of their lives once again, while killing Sid, Willie and Repo. Ah, 
   the circle of life!&nbsp; What a terrible, horrible film. It's hard 
   to get excited about a film when the acting is horrendous (the two 
   girls who portray the young Sugar and Bobbylee are so aggravating, 
   you'll soon be begging for them to be hung on Jebediah's meat hooks)

   dismembered body parts, a smattering of nudity, some gore and a 
   confusing earthquake sequence (What the hell was that for?), but this

   This is Bruno Mattei's second-to-last film and if there was one thing 
   Bruno Mattei (here using his &quot;Vincent Dawn&quot; pseudonym) had 
   until the day he died (May 21, 2007), it was the sleaze factor. If 
   you want to see him use it in one of his best films, this is the film 
   you need to see. As a matter of fact, it out-sleazes most of the WIP 
   films of the 70's &amp; 80's and does it so easily, it was like 
   Mattei could do it with his eyes closed. But his eyes are wide open 
   here and you should really, really purchase this DVD now that it is 
   available on legitimate DVD from Intervision Picture Corp. in the 
   United States, uncut and in anamorphic widescreen. And it looks 
   fantastic. This made-in-the-Philippines WIP flick also contains some 
   familiar male faces to those who were into action films from the 
   Philippines during the 1980's. It has something for everyone. 
   Full-frontal female nudity with women with extremely dark nipples, 
   sleazy ultra violence (some which goes way beyond the bounds of good 
   taste), lesbianism, torture, whorehouses, orgies and more things than 
   a sleazehound could demand. And we know who we are. The movie opens 
   with a ship motoring down a river, carrying three female prisoners 
   who are about to be delivered to one of the worst female prisons in 
   the history of film. The thing is, none of these three women say they 
   are innocent. Lisa (Love<A HREF="jail_a_womens_hell_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/jail the women's hell dvd3 front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="213" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>

   people&quot;. Carol (Amelie Pontailler) says she &quot;Whacked my

    THE BEGINNING</A></B> [both 2007]) says, &quot;I've done everything 
   you said and even worse!&quot;. When the male guards see the ship 
   pulling in to the dock, one of them says, &quot;Here comes some more 
   occupants for the House Of Lost Souls!&quot; (The prison's name). The 
   other guard says, &quot;They can't imagine what's in store for 
   them!&quot; They are placed on a bus and make the long trip to the 
   prison, nothing but a mud-caked hell of dirt and barely-standing 
   buildings. The whole prison meets The Director (Odette Khan), where 
   she tells the three newest recruits that they are no longer humans, 
   they are numbers, and their numbers will be #51, #52 &amp; #53. She 
   also tells her prison guards to pull out prisoner #27 out of &quot;The
    Hole&quot; and when one of the guards tells The Director that she is 
   dead, The Director still wants her to get twenty lashes, as a warning 
   to anyone else who tries to escape, so they strip the corpse naked 
   and whip her 20 times as the corpse's back turns into a bloody pulp. 
   We then watch our three newest prisoners get naked power hose 
   washings (while the female guards laugh their asses off) and then 
   examined by 'The Doctor&quot; (David Brass; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#WarriorsApocalypse">WARRIORS
    OF THE APOCALYPSE</A></B> - 1985), who uses his fingers to explore 
   every one of their orifices. They are then handed prison garb and put 
   in a cell with a half-dozen other prisoners. &quot;Welcome to the 
   Grand Hotel. Welcome to Hell!&quot; is their official greeting by the 
   inmates. Jennifer talks to one of the veterans of the prison, Monica 
   (Dyane Craystan), who says she's been here for an eternity for 
   &quot;cutting off my old man's balls.&quot; Lisa is threatened by a 
   lesbian prisoner with a shiv and soon Lisa becomes her bitch. Late 
   that night, the three new girls are pulled out of their beds by The 
   Director to meet the cruel and powerful &quot;The Governor&quot; (our 
   old friend Jim Gaines; <B><A HREF="action.htm#JungleRats">JUNGLE RATS</A></B> 
   - 1987) the owner of the island's whorehouse, who says &quot;Well, 
   well, well.&quot; and makes all three strip, but nothing happens to 
   them...yet. We see some female returnees from the whorehouse and they 
   are beaten, bloody and unable to walk. The Director tells the three 
   new prisoners in front of everyone else that if they refuse to go to 
   the whorehouse, they will end up like prisoner #27. The prisoners 
   start a mini-riot when one of the whorehouse women comes back dead 
   and Jennifer demands to see a doctor. The Doctor appears and says he 
   will write up a death certificate tomorrow morning for The Director 
   (You can be damn sure that the certificate will be a lie). The 
   prisoners dig her grave in the pouring rain and uncover some more 
   dead bodies in the process (Ones that were probably never reported). 
   The next morning, everyone's breakfast consists of nothing but a cup 
   of liquid which is supposed to be coffee and then work removing rocks 
   from the muddy earth (those that can't carry their load are beaten 
   repeatedly). That night, Jennifer and Lisa are made to work in the 
   whorehouse where Mr. Alvarez (Bobby Benitez) beats Jennifer and Lisa 
   senseless and tries to rape them. Jennifer knock him out (it begins 
   to look like she not really saying who she actually is). The Director 
   interrupts the communal shower (plenty of full-frontal female nudity) 
   when she sees two lesbians going at it, so she gives them to two 
   males guards to rape the lesbianism out if them. Jennifer is back at 
   the whorehouse where The Governor offers her a job at a party. When 
   she declines, she is forced to pick a piece of paper out of a hat. 
   She is then chained in a room and has to watch a woman tied naked to

   - 1983; in his final film. He passed away on August 4, 2006 and is 
   seen in a wheelchair here.). He and a group of men sit around the bed 
   while a large snake is put on the naked woman's body. They force the 
   snake to slither up her vagina, as The Sadist and his men watch her 
   die. Monica is tied between two poles and given twenty lashes just 
   for being Jennifer's friend, but The Governor says he needs Monica, 
   so The Director substitutes prisoner #12 instead (another friend of 
   Jennifer's). Jennifer and some other prisoners dig the grave for 
   prisoner #12 and Jennifer says she found a way to escape. Too bad one 
   of the prisoners, Valery (Xeah Atillano) is a snitch for The 
   Director, who supplies her with a shot of heroin every day and 
   reports the escape plans. The Governor has some very special plans 
   for the three new prisoners, as well as some older ones (Monica has 
   to spend a night in a cage half-filled with water by the dock, where 
   the corpse of another female prisoner has her face chewed off by 
   rats). As the rest of the prisoners kill Valery for being a traitor, 
   Jennifer accepts The Governor's offer and has sex with him (The 
   Governor says, &quot;You know, you're a pretty big whore!&quot;). 
   This is part of Jennifer's plan for all the prisoners to escape, but 
   The Governor is aware of it and has a special plan of his own. This 
   is where the film turns into an ultra-bloody version of <B><A HREF="most_dangerous_game_1932.htm">THE
    MOST DANGEROUS GAME</A></B> (1932), as the Governor and his male 
   buddies arm themselves with shotguns and automatic weapons and let 
   the women prisoners run through the island for one hour before they 
   begin to hunt them down. The Governor's only rule: There are no 
   rules. Some native island guides lead The Governor and his men in 
   hunting the women down. One woman is killed by a swinging spiked log, 
   while two others are captured and killed (One is hanging from a tree 
   quartered with a machete up her vagina with a sign around her neck 
   saying &quot;Your Fate Will Be Worse&quot;.) Jennifer pulls the 
   machete out of her snatch and says that the hunters have made one 
   fatal mistake: They have given them a weapon. Jennifer and the other 
   prisoners find the second captured prisoner hanging from a tree, her 
   body all cut to hell with another note hanging around her. This one 
   says &quot;You Have No Hope&quot;. Rachel (Cristina Castro) is found 
   by the men and is shot over and over in her extremities by shotgun 
   blasts, so she's still alive when the men have stopped firing. She's 
   then gang-raped and killed (This is the highlight of the <A HREF="jail_a_womens_hell_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/jail a women's hell poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>film
    for me. Yes, I know, I'm a sick bastard!). Lisa gets caught in a 
   booby-trap that leaves her hanging upside-down. Before they can 
   release her, Jennifer, Carol and Monica have to run away because they 
   are being shot at. Poor Lisa is let down, stripped naked, tied to a 
   tree, has her tongue cut out and than has both of her breasts cut off 
   (nothing is left to the imagination and this is the film's most 
   sadistic scenes, as one of the men sucks the blood from one of her 
   missing breasts). Carol is bitten by a poisonous snake and says she 
   has to stay behind. Jennifer gives her the machete and Carol feigns 
   she is dead. When one of the men checks her body, she runs the 
   machete up his crotch, but he pulls it out and cuts off Carol's head 
   before he dies. Jennifer and Monica feel guilty and go back to check 
   up on Carol, but when they find her headless body, they collect the 
   man's shotgun and handgun and keep on traveling. Monica stays behind 
   and tells Jennifer to make it to civilization to tell the government 
   what is going on. Monica ends up killing The Governor with a few 
   shotgun blasts, but the Director intervenes and says she will be made 
   an example of back at the prison. They put a black hood around 
   Monica's head and a noose around her neck, but before they can hang 
   her, two big black limousines come through the gates and The Director 
   is arrested. Jessica was a government plant all along and when she 
   pulls the hood off of Monica's head, she says, &quot;I told you I 
   would be back.&quot; For once the women win, as they clap while The 
   Director is led away in handcuffs.&nbsp; When <A HREF="bruno_mattei_films.htm">Bruno
    Mattei</A> passed away in 2007, so did films like this. He was the 
   only Italian sleaze director still churning out films during the New 
   Millennium, giving us copious nudity, graphic gore and dialogue as 
   only the Italians could write it. Sure, a lot of Mattei's later films 
   were turds, but at least they were made. Better to watch an Italian 
   turd than an American-made turd because at least you knew with the 
   Italians, there was no such thing as bad taste. And bad taste is 
   severely lacking in most American horror films today. We seem to 
   cater more to the PG-13 crowd than the people who remember when 
   horror films had balls. Mattei was the last one to remind us of that. 
   To say he will be severely missed is a huge understatement. When the 
   Italian horror industry died, Mattei found funding to make horror 
   films in the Philippines, still keeping the Italian aesthetic, but 
   using local actors instead. This way I got the best of both worlds: 
   Italian-made films, with Filipino and expatriate actors I have 
   admired since the 80's. Thanks for everything, Bruno Mattei. If there 
   is such a thing as the afterlife, I hope you are living your dreams. 
   I really pity those who don't buy DVDs anymore. The widescreen 
   anamorphic print used by InterVision Picture Corp. is flawless and 
   looked excellent on my Blu-Ray player. If you are deciding to wait to 
   see this on Blu-Ray, let me ask you one question: When was the last 
   time a Bruno Mattei film was released in that format? I think <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Rats">RATS:
    NIGHT OF TERROR</A></B> (1983) and <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HellLivingDead1980">HELL
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> (1980) were the only films if his 
   released on Blu- Ray and on a double feature disc at that (at the 
   time this review was written). Never say never, but this DVD looks 
   excellent, so why deprive yourself? Not for the weak-hearted because 
   of tons of nasty violence I haven't even touched on in this review. 
   It has everything (and more) than a sleazehound like me demands, 
   although films like this are not for all tastes. I think this is the 
   best of Bruno Mattei's New Millennium films. I've been waiting for 
   this one to get a legitimate U.S. release for nine years and I was 
   not disappointed. Also starring Jenny Agwilla, Joana Lee and Vanessa 
   Bolabas. An InterVision Picture Corp. DVD Release. <B>Not Rated</B>

    JEKYLL AND HYDE PORTFOLIO</A><A NAME="JekyllHydePortfolio"></A> 
   (1971) -</B> This little-seen sex/horror film opens with a young 
   woman named Janet (Cathie Demille) being impaled with a pitchfork 
   while playing on a swing.&nbsp; An on-screen narrator then gives us a 
   short visual tour on mass murderers throughout history that suffered 
   from Jekyll/Hyde syndrome. The film then tells the story of strict 
   disciplinarian Dr. Dorian Cabala (Sebastian Brooks), a 19th Century 
   physician who runs the Florence Nightingale Institute, a facility 
   where young women are trained to become nurses. Since Janet was a 
   nurse-in-training at the institute, Detective John Kirkland (Donn 
   Greer, also the film's scripter) questions Dr. Cabala and his 
   assistant, Dr. Leticia Borges (Mady Maguire). Det. Kirkland informs 
   them that Janet was murdered by a &quot;psychopathic killer&quot; who 
   left three star-shaped punctures on her body that form some 
   premeditated pattern or symbol (Like the letter &quot;V&quot;). 
   Hunchbacked institute groundskeeper Moss (Hump Hardy) watches Dyan 
   (Sandy Carey) and her boyfriend Garr (Duane Grace) making love in a 
   barn and, a short time later, they are both killed by someone 
   carrying a sword. The institute's head nurse, Hettie Green (Casey 
   Larrain), lost her daughter years earlier due to the malpractice of a 
   quack doctor and she spends most her time abusing or feeling-up the 
   staff and students. Sergeant Wolf (Gray Daniels) begins<A HREF="jekyll_and_hyde_portfolio_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/jekyll and hyde portfolio british vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="264" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   questioning the staff and comes up with an important clue from the 
   facially-scarred cook (we don't hear it). When Elizabeth (Nora 
   Wieternik) goes missing and the three-star symbol is found on her bed 
   written in blood, two other student nurses go looking for her in the 
   institute's maze-like basement. Moss kills one of the girls and rapes 
   the other, but Dr. Cabala and Sgt. Wolf catch him in the act and 
   capture him. Det. Kinkaid is not satisfied that Moss is the 
   ritualistic killer (&quot;His mentality isn't that of a sadistic 
   killer. He's an ignorant, poor mute.&quot;) and continues the 
   investigation. Good thing, too, because the killer turns out to be 
   June (Rene Bond), a former mental patient, who suffers from a split 
   personality. She kills a few more people (including slicing-up 
   another couple making love with a scythe) before Det. Kinkaid shoots 
   her and she falls on her scythe. The narrator then comes back 
   on-screen to warn all of us that we, too, are capable of carrying an 
   evil split personality. He then scrunches-up his face and makes evil 
   gestures with his hands as his double-exposure evil split personality 
   skulks away. Beware!&nbsp; This short (77 minutes) feature contains 
   plenty of softcore sex (both straight and lesbian), bloody early-70's 
   violence (including a decapitation) and dissections of live frogs, 
   but the production values never rise above that of an Andy Milligan 
   film, who filmed most of his productions as period pieces so they 
   wouldn't seem dated when viewed years later. Director/producer Eric 
   Jeffrey Haims tries the same thing here, but the porn-style sets, bad 
   post-synch dubbing and amateur acting doom this film from the start. 
   Director Haims must have thought so too, because his next four films 
   were hardcore porn: <B><A HREF="101_acts_of_love_1971.htm">101 ACTS

   SCREAM IN THE STREETS</A></B> - 1973) and they all do softcore scenes 
   here. The funniest parts of the film are the murders themselves. 
   Before each murder takes place, we hear circus music (the tune that 
   organ grinders use to play while their trained monkeys stole money 
   out of unsuspecting audience members' pockets). What the music has to 
   do with the murderer's motivations is never made clear (I think that 
   it being in the public domain played a big part), but it's funny as 
   hell to hear it while people are sliced-up or losing their heads. The 
   gore is never convincing and primitive (the decapitation looks like a 
   bloody mannequin head), but I will give proper credit for not 
   skimping on the blood. This is a threadbare film, but it does try to 
   be different. The final shot of the narrator making an evil face 
   (using no makeup) is so unintentionally funny, it's almost worth the 
   price of a rental or purchase. Co-star Jane Tsentas, who plays

   seeing the trailer for this film on some early DVD releases from Code

   (the same with <B><A HREF="family_honor_1973.htm">FAMILY HONOR</A></B>

    IN MOVIE CLASSICS</A></B>) and I was surprised how good the 
   fullscreen print looked (especially when there was another film on 
   the disc). This film fell into the Public Domain years ago and it is 
   on a lot of compilations, but those expecting an action-packed 
   blaxploitation film are going to be disappointed. This is more of a 
   low-budget &quot;day in the life&quot; portrayal of major numbers 
   runner (and pimp) Pasha (his real name is Hakim, but only his enemies 
   call him that) and what he has to deal with on a daily basis, 
   including threats, traitors, being married and some murder. The film,

   did poor business, so the distributors pulled it and retitled it <B><A HREF="jive_turkey_1974.htm">JIVE
    TURKEY</A></B>, where it still did poor business at the boxoffice. 
   This is purportedly based on a true story that happened in 1956 
   (&quot;Only the names were changed to protect the innocent&quot;), 
   where Ohio numbers runner Pasha (Paul Harris; <B><A HREF="slams_1973.htm">THE
    SLAMS</A></B> - 1973; <B><A HREF="truck_turner_1974.htm">TRUCK TURNER</A></B> 
   - 1974) is the #1 numbers runner in the city (he also has a 
   whorehouse, but doesn't cheat on his wife), whom everyone in the city 
   loves, because he cares about his city, his customers and the people 
   in general and his crimes are minor when compared to crime boss Big 
   Tony (Frank De Kova; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Cat In The Cage">CAT
    IN THE CAGE</A></B> - 1978), who distributes heroin, mistreats his 
   hookers and shoots black people for fun (at the beginning of the 
   film, while the opening credits run, we see two of Tony's goons 
   machine-gunning down innocent black citizens, like an old lady 
   carrying her groceries and a young boy riding his bike, as a warning 
   to Pasha, while Ernie Banks [<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Black Godfather">THE
    BLACK GODFATHER</A></B> - 1974] sings the title song [he also has a 
   role in the film as &quot;DuDirty&quot;]). Pasha, along with female 
   companion Serene (who we later find out is actually a transvestite, 
   played by Don Edmondson), have a meeting with Tony at his Italian 
   restaurant, where Tony wants Pasha (he one of the people to call him 
   &quot;Hakim&quot;) to turn over his numbers rackets on the southside 
   of town. Tony warns Pasha that &quot;Chicago runs things now&quot; 
   and tells Pasha that the Chicago mob has put a hit out on him. Tony 
   says he will cut off Pasha a slice of his heroin and prostitution 
   rackets in return, but Pasha says he wants nothing to do with heroin, 
   because kids in his neighborhood are dying from it. Pasha says that 
   he will need 30 days to get his business in order before he can turn 
   things over to Tony and asks him to cancel the hit. Tony then tells 
   Pasha that a member of his gang is a traitor and reports everything 
   directly to Tony, so if he does anything behind Tony's back, he will 
   know it. Pasha then asks Tony to step outside so they can talk 
   privately, leaving Serene alone with one of Tony's goons. Serene then 
   slashes the goon's throat with a sharp ring he/she is wearing (we see 
   a nice bloody wound), Serene comes outside laughing and she and Tony 
   take off in their car (Pasha never considered turning his business 
   over to Tony and this was a small payback for the massacre he 
   orchestrated earlier in the film). The rest of the film finds Tony 
   running his numbers racket, visiting his whorehouse (he slugs a white 
   prostitute by mistake when she hugs him from behind and he apologizes 
   profusely), seeing his very understanding wife (and having sex, the 
   only nudity in this film) and putting Serene in charge of finding the 
   traitor. Pasha also takes an interest in young buck Nathan Jones 
   (Curtis Price); his little brother Billy (Terry Ransom) already works 
   for Pasha, his betting slips are inside the bags of potato chips, 
   joking &quot;That boy sure eats a lot of potato chips!&quot; (Both 
   Nathan and Pasha laugh) and Pasha has his brother Jimmy (Larry 
   Greene) show the Nathan the ropes of taking and collecting bets 
   (There's a funny scene between Nathan and DuDirty about an unpaid 
   payout owed to Nathan, but Pasha takes care of it in his usual 
   level-headed way). Pasha's #1 man, Sweetman (Reginald Farmer), knows 
   all the hiding places where people place their bets, like a broken 
   washing machine, inside a pool table, etc. and makes daily pickups on 
   the bets. Meanwhile, The Mayor and City Council (who are all coming 
   up for re-election) want to do something to get them votes, so they 
   bring in an &quot;expert&quot; to explain how the numbers racket 
   works and how to get rid of Pasha (Typical meeting banter: <B>Mayor:</B> 
   &quot;What kind of name in Pasha?&quot;&nbsp; <B>Councilman:</B> 
   &quot;A nigger name.&quot;). Thankfully, Pasha and the white Police 
   Chief are tight and he informs Pasha about what is going on at those 
   meetings, but the Police Chief says he has to make a few minor 
   arrests of his men so no one becomes suspicious of him. His police 
   force arrests Jimmy in a poolhall (after Sweetman escapes a police 
   chase by hiding his car in a U-Haul truck), so Pasha's young black 
   lawyer, Sam Kingston (Henry Sanders; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Deadly Sunday">DEADLY
    SUNDAY</A></B> - 1982), proves his worth and gets Jimmy out of jail 
   before Tony's men can kill him. Pasha gets caught in the middle of 
   another hit and one of his men ends up dead and another one gets shot 
   in the leg, but what hurts Pasha the worst is when Nathan is 
   kidnapped and then found dead and dumped (in front of Billy, who 
   yells for Nathan to &quot;Get up!&quot;) with an icepick sticking in 
   his neck, a note addressed to Pasha, which Sweetman brings him. All 
   it says is, &quot;You're Next&quot;. Pasha then sets up a plan where 
   every bad guy will get their due, but only a select few of his people 
   know the plan. Serene takes two of Tony's hitmen to a motel room 
   (with an offer of sex, they not knowing that Serene is a 
   transvestite), where Serene drugs their booze and then beats them 
   both to death with the sharp heel of her shoe to their faces (the 
   film's bloody highlight, as we see the hitmen's bloody faces as blood 
   splatters on the camera lens until all we see is red). Pasha goes to 
   Big Tony's house, where se says he wants to make a deal. Tony tells 
   Pasha that he wants him dead (&quot;You've always been a man of 
   honor, Hakim. Something I never could stand in a nigger.&quot;) and 
   then makes Pasha play Russian Roulette with the gun Pasha left at 
   Tony's restaurant earlier in the film. It seems Tony filed down the 
   firing pin, just to see Pasha sweat, but Tony makes a big mistake 
   when he tells Pasha the the room they are in is soundproof. Pasha 
   hits Tony on his head over-and-over with the butt of the gun until we 
   see quick shots of brain matter flying through the air. Pasha's crew 
   are having a party at Reverend Axle's (Onezene 'Ben' Geyen) house, 
   not knowing that it will be their last party together. Pasha and 
   Jimmy are flying to Mexico tomorrow (Pasha also hands over and 
   envelope full of money to Serene, saying to &quot;lay low&quot;, so 
   Serene changes into men's clothing, complete with bald head, thick 
   black-rimmed glasses, a nice three-piece suit and carrying a 
   briefcase and walks outside, where three of Tony's goons are waiting 
   for Serene to come out so they can blow her away. They see the bald 
   guy come out and think nothing of him when he walks up to the driver 
   and asks for a light for his cigar, but when the male Serene walks 
   away, we hear her distinct laugh and the camera freezes on the three 
   goons' faces (I quess we know that they realize their time is up on 
   this Earth). Serene also discovered who the traitor is and told Pasha 
   earlier. It is Sweetman and Pasha has his men machine-<A HREF="baby_needs_a_new_pair_of_shoes_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/baby needs a new pair of shoes aka jive turkey poster8a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="199" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>gun
    him down while he is making a call to Tony (who he doesn't know is 
   dead) in a phone booth. As Sweetman comes stumbling out of the phone 
   booth with his bullet-ridden body, his life flashes in front of his 
   eyes and he dies in the gutter. A fitting death for a traitor. The 
   film then ends with these final words: THE DEAD END.&nbsp; Although

   with the blaxploitation genre, the screenplay, by 
   first-and-only-timer Fredricka DeCosta, is too laid-back for its own 
   good. There aren't nearly enough action sequences and it plays more 
   like a character study, with very brief instances of violence every 
   30 minutes. It also doesn't help that this film is also full of 
   anachronisms, including in the first shot, where Tony's goons step 
   out of a 1973 Cadillac and this is supposed to be 1956. We also see 
   plenty of 70's cars reflected off the windows of store fronts. Also, 
   one boy wears a L.A. Dodgers baseball cap and the Dodgers didn't move 
   from New York to L.A. until 1958. We also see the boom mike make 
   appearances at the top of the screen during the City Council 
   meetings, but that is probably because the fullscreen print is open 
   matte and it would have been masked out when shown in widescreen. On 
   the plus side, there is decent acting by nearly everyone involved and 
   having a transvestite character being the boss's sidekick was a 
   ballsy move for a film set in 1956. I get the feeling that Brame was 
   trying to surprise the audience by revealing Serene was actually a 
   transvestite when she changed into men's clothing during the finale, 
   but it is highly apparent that she was actually a he the first time 
   we saw Serene (The opening credits say &quot;And Introducing 
   Serene&quot;, while the closing credits gives out the actor's real 
   name, who has never done anything since). Pasha's life is also shown 
   as being anything but glamorous because, even though he has all the 
   amenities money can buy, including a beautiful penthouse where he 
   lives with his mother Mama Lottie (Frances Williams; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#TogetherBrothers">TOGETHER
    BROTHERS</A></B> - 1974) and beautiful wife named Romaine (Karmello 
   Brooks), he really has no time to pay attention to the finer things 
   because he is always taking care of business. I have to say I was 
   disappointed in the film because all the action in the film is shown 
   in the trailer, but if your tastes run more toward character 
   development than action, this film may hold some interest to you. 
   Just don't watch the trailer first. Production Designer Art Names

    VIRGIN FORCE</A><A NAME="JungleVirginForce"></A> (1982) -</B> Screwy 
   Indonesian jungle film about a female vine-swinger named Jelita 
   (Lidya Kandou). She saves a group of female tribe members from a 
   killer crocodile and to show their appreciation, the female members 
   want to make her an honorary Queen of the tribe, which doesn't sit 
   too well with the skinny High Priest and the other male members. They 
   slaughter most of the females, but Jelita and the real Queen get away 
   (the Queen is tossed off a cliff, but she gets up and dusts herself 
   off!). Meanwhile, a group of college students in Jakarta have gotten 
   their hands on a map that will lead them to treasure in the New 
   Guinea jungle, located in an area called the Triangle of Death. Also 
   after the map are a group of criminals who try to steal the map but, 
   time and time again, are unsuccessful. The college kids take a plane 
   to the outskirts of the New Guinea jungle, where they meet guide Mr. 
   Bunyon (who wears a yellow hardhat!). He leads them down <A HREF="jungle_virgin_force_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/jungle virgin force greek vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="133" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>river
    in a canoe and almost immediately end up falling over a waterfall 
   (some guide!), forcing them to continue on foot. One of the female 
   college students is captured by the male tribe, who cut off her head 
   with a stone axe and parade it around on a pole. The crooks are 
   following close behind and are also captured by the tribe. When the 
   tribe attack the college students, Jelita swings (literally) into 
   action, but the tribe kidnaps female member Maya and seriously wounds 
   Bunyon with a spear to his back (one college kid stupidly asks, 
   &quot;Bunyon, are you O.K.?&quot; while Bunyon is lying there 
   bleeding with a big-ass spear in his back). After watching the tribe 
   consume the flesh of one male crook, Jelita saves Maya and the rest 
   of the crooks and everyone joins forces against the tribe and the 
   spiked boobytraps in the jungle. Bunyon recognizes Jelita as the 
   daughter he lost in a plane crash in the jungle many years ago and 
   makes the college students promise to bring her back to civilization, 
   just before he dies. Jelita and one of the college guys fall in love 
   as the crooks plot a way to get their hands on the map. The 
   conclusion finds the surviving female members fighting the males for 
   control of tribe and the college students fighting the crooks for 
   control of the map. Only two make it out alive. Can you guess which 
   ones?&nbsp; Unbelievably stupid, but hilarious in execution, <B><A HREF="jungle_virgin_force_1982c.htm">JUNGLE
    VIRGIN FORCE</A></B> is laugh-a-minute mindless fun. The male tribe 
   members are portrayed as bumbling buffoons yet, when they kill other 
   people, the film suddenly turns very serious and bloody. I especially 
   liked the scene where the High Priest of the tribe (who can shoot 
   magical lightning bolts from his fingertips) rewards the male members 
   he thinks have killed the Queen by growing horns (big-ass horns!) on 
   the top of their heads! One tribe member uses his horns later on to 
   gore one of the crooks in the stomach, just before they cannibalize 
   him. Another hilarious scene has one of the college guys befriending 
   a male tribe member and trying to make him civilized. He looks at his 
   penis and says, &quot;Always keep that thing covered up! Do you want 
   people to think you're immoral?&quot; As with most latter-day jungle 
   films, there's scenes of real animal slaughter, a female tribal dance 
   and plenty of stock jungle footage. Curiously, all the female nudity 
   is optically fogged out, but not a couple of instances of male 
   nudity. Jelita, who has a monkey sidekick, also has the lamest 
   Tarzan-like yell you'll ever hear. The film also offers plenty of 
   bloodshed, as people are impaled by spears, arrows and flying rocks 
   (!), one female tribe member dissolves bloodily before your eyes, a 
   guy is attacked by a horde of snakes and the final battle between the 
   High Priest and the Queen causes a volcano to erupt! Good stuff. Good 
   stuff. Directed by Danu Umbara (<B><A HREF="action.htm#FiveDeadlyAngels">FIVE

    The film opens with this scrawl: <B>&quot;This film is based on 
   actual events that took place in a Central European country not many 
   years ago.&quot;</B> (A cursory investigation shows it took place in 
   Belgium and that, indeed, this film is based on a true story, proving 
   fact is more entertaining than fiction). We then see an unknown nun 
   confessing her sins to a priest in a confessional, telling the priest 
   that she will never forgive &quot;him&quot; for what he has done for 
   her. She hates &quot;him&quot; so much that she despises all men and 
   wishes they were dead. When the priest hears this, he condemns the 
   nun, telling her she is no longer a member of the Order and that her 
   next confession should be to God almighty, because no mere mortal 
   could ever forgive her sins.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see a cheerful Sister Gertrude (Anita Ekberg; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#FangsLivingDead1969">FANGS
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> - 1969) waking up everyone at the old age 
   hospital she works at (it looks more like an insane asylum). She 
   assists Dr. Poirret (Massimo Serato; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BloodstainShadow78">THE
    BLOODSTAINED SHADOW</A></B> - 1978) on his daily rounds, treating 
   the elderly patients, but when she passes a table containing scalpels 
   and other sharp medical instruments, an evil look appears on her 
   face. After almost becoming an Angel of Death with an elderly sick 
   female patient, Dr. Poirret stops her, pulling a scalpel from her 
   hands. Something bad recently happened to Sister Gertrude (Dr. 
   Poirret knows, but we are not clued-in...yet) and, oh, she's a 
   morphine addict! Sister Mathieu (Paola Morra; <B><A HREF="behind_convent_walls_1978.htm">BEHIND
    CONVENT WALLS</A></B> - 1978) is worried about her, so she sneaks 
   into the hospital's record room and takes an x-ray of Sister 
   Gertrude's head. There is definitely something wrong with Sister 
   Gertrude, because when the elderly patients are eating breakfast, she 
   pulls patient Josephine's (Nerina Montagnani; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Tormentor1972">TORMENTOR</A></B> 
   - 1972) false teeth out of a glass of water and stomps on them, 
   breaking Josephine's choppers into a million pieces. We then see a 
   naked Sister Mathieu&nbsp; telling Sister Gertrude that she burned 
   the x-rays of her skull, so no one will know what is wrong with her. 
   What exactly is wrong with her (besides being a drug addict)?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next time we see Sister Gertrude, she is stepping off a train. 
   She goes into the train station's bathroom and changes from her habit 
   and other religious dress into civilian clothes, putting her 
   religious clothes in a locker. She then goes to a jeweler and sells 
   some jewelry she stole off a recently deceased patient, using the 
   money to have dinner at an expensive bistro. She comes on to a man 
   sitting at the bistro's bar, hiking up her dress to show him some 
   leg. He follows her outside to an apartment building, where they have 
   sex. The man finishes rather quickly (What man doesn't?), leaving 
   Sister Gertrude to fend for herself (If you know what I mean). Once 
   back at the hospital, we see Sister Gertrude stealing several vials 
   of morphine from the hospital's infirmary, hiding them in her dresser drawer.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The hospital Director (Daniele Dublino; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#ShortNightDolls1971">SHORT
    NIGHT OF THE GLASS DOLLS</A></B> - 1971) confront Sister Gertrude 
   about her odd behavior as of late and she blames Dr. Poirret, telling 
   the Director that he is too old to be treating patients and that he 
   should be replaced. The Director says he will take it under 
   consideration and will discuss it with the hospital's board of 
   directors, and leaves. Sister Gertrude then injects herself with some 
   morphine and begins to trip, seeing Josephine kissing an exposed 
   brain (!) and a naked dead patient coming to life in the hospital 
   morgue, the good Sister grabbing his penis! Sister Gertrude is 
   proving herself to being the worst kind of nun, but the worst is yet 
   to come. A male patient discovers Sister Gertrude tripping and drags 
   her to a hospital bed and we see a nun beat him over the head with a 
   metal lamp, drag his body to an open window and throw him out to the 
   pavement below, making it look like he committed suicide. Sister 
   Mathieu tells Gertrude that she saw what she did, but not to worry, 
   because she will protect her. Dr. Poirret tells Gertrude that he has 
   been called to appear in front of the board of directors, but not to 
   worry, as he will not mention her &quot;problem&quot;.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A short time later, a new doctor appears at the hospital. His name 
   is Patrick Roland (a badly dubbed Joe Dallesandro; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Madness1980">MADNESS</A></B> 
   - 1980) and he is there to replace a recently fired Dr. Poirret. One 
   look on Sister Gertrude's face tells us that she is instantly 
   smitten. At a game of &quot;Truth or Dare&quot; with the hospital's 
   patients, crippled patient Peter (Lou Castel; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Paranoia1969">PARANOIA</A></B> 
   - 1969) asks Sister Gertrude why she killed the patient who 
   supposedly committed suicide and by the look on her face, we can see 
   that Peter doesn't have long to live. During a thunderstorm, Sister 
   Gertrude, who is once again tripping (or is she?), sees female 
   patient Florence (Ileana Fraia; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Don'tLookAttic1982">DON'T
    LOOK IN THE ATTIC</A></B> - 1982)) having sex with an elderly 
   patient in a wheelchair (!) and when Sister Mathieu leaves Gertrude's 
   side, we see a nun stuffing gauze down the elderly wheelchair 
   patient's throat, making it look like he died of a heart attack.&nbsp;
    Dr. Roland finds the man's body on hospital grounds the next morning 
   and when Florence sees his body, she has a nervous breakdown.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Dr. Roland is smarter than he looks, knowing something is seriously 
   wrong with Sister Gertrude. When he sees Gertrude making the elderly 
   patients do calisthenics, he stops her, asking her if she wants to 
   see the elderly patients die. The look on Gertrude's face tells him 
   yes. Sister Gertrude is slowly losing her grasp on reality, partly 
   due to her drug addiction and partly due to her &quot;problem&quot; 
   (I am close to guessing what it is. Are you?). Gertrude feigns that 
   she was attacked by someone in the hospital, causing the Director to 
   gather all the patients and staff, demanding to know who attacked her 
   and for them to confess, but no one does. Dr. Roland later confronts 
   the Director, telling him he sees no reason why Dr. Poirret was 
   fired, because he looked at all of his records and every one of his 
   diagnoses was correct. The Director fails to mention that it was 
   Sister Gertrude who made the complaint and we find out why. Gertrude 
   has something dirty on the Director and she threatens to expose him 
   if he doesn't go along with her &quot;suggestions&quot;.&nbsp; We 
   then see a nun take the crippled Peter down to the boiler room, 
   leaving his crutches at the top of the stairs. Peter pulls himself up 
   the stairs step-by-step while the hospital staff looks for him, 
   Sister Gertrude and Sister Mathieu stopping anyone from looking in 
   the boiler room. As Peter makes it to the top of the stairs and 
   reaches for his crutches, a nun appears, kicking his head until he 
   falls down the stairs, dead. When the staff find Peter dead the next 
   morning, they believe he accidentally fell down the stairs, but the 
   Mother Superior (Alida Valli; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#EyeInTheLabyrinth">EYE
    IN THE LABYRINTH</A></B> - 1972) calls Gertrude into her office, 
   telling her that someone reported her for murdering patients. Was it 
   Dr. Roland, who noticed the multiple needle marks on Gertrude's arms? 
   How about the Director, who is tired of being blackmailed? Or could 
   it be Sister Mathieu, who tells everything to Dr. Roland and then has 
   sex with him on a hospital gurney? It doesn't matter, as the Mother 
   Superior confines Gertrude to her cell while she slowly goes out of 
   her mind, partly due to withdrawal and partly due to her medical 
   &quot;problem&quot;. The film ends with Sister Gertrude going crazy 
   in her cell, as we then discover that it was Sister Mathieu who was 
   killing the patients, not Gertrude. It turns out it was Sister 
   Mathieu who was confessing to the priest in the beginning of the 
   film, only this time it is revealed that she is confessing to an 
   empty confessional.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Berruti and Alberto Tarallo (Umberto Lenzi's <B><A HREF="manhunt_in_the_city_1975.htm">MANHUNT

   a religious hospital and the weird thing is that it works here. You 
   will actually believe that the deadly things that happened there 
   could really have taken place, giving the opening scrawl some 
   credence. Anita Ekberg is wonderful as the drug-addicted nun who is 
   losing her grip on reality. We are made to believe she is the one 
   committing the murders, but watching the film for a second time shows 
   us that it is all in our minds, as we never see her killing anyone, 
   all we see is someone in a nun's habit committing the dirty deeds. It 
   is this artistry that changed my mind about nunsploitation flicks, at 
   least where this film is concerned. It is filled with many bizarre 
   sights, as we see someone sticking the tip of hypodermic needles into 
   an elderly woman patient's face, pinning her eyelid to her eyeball (a 
   hard scene to watch without flinching), but she can't scream because 
   her mouth is taped shut. Add that to the scene of wheelchair sex and 
   many other unusual sights on view and you have a film that would make 
   David Lynch proud.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   allowing him one take before walking off the set. I believe it is Ted

   Here's a racially-charged 70's exploitation film with an A-list cast. 
   When a white woman, Nancy Poteet (Linda Evans), is raped by a black 
   man in Atoka County, Alabama, the town's sheriff, Track Bascombe (Lee 
   Marvin), tries to keep the peace between the county's black and white

   is the &quot;Exaulted Cyclops&quot; of the local chapter of the KKK 
   or that a group of black and white protesters are planning a black 
   voting rally in town the coming weekend. Members of the KKK grab a 
   black man off the side of the road and castrate him, followed by a 
   diet of several bullets, one fired by each member of the KKK that are 
   present. The dead black man's friend, Garth (O.J. Simpson), the local 
   black hothead, witnesses the atrocity and vows revenge against 
   whitey. Garth dresses as a KKK member and lures one KKK member out of 
   his house and then perforates his body with a shotgun blast. Sheriff 
   Bascomb's best friend, Breck Stancill (Richard Burton), who owns 
   thousands of acres in the county (his ancestors were slave owners in 
   the same county), is sympathetic to the black cause and plans on 
   letting the protesters stay on his land while they prepare for their 
   rally. As you can probably guess, this doesn't sit too well with the 
   KKK and the majority of townspeople, who are racist rednecks 
   (including the women!). When Nancy is considered persona non grata 
   with the local white population (Even though she was raped, she's 
   chased out of church during Sunday Services when the parishioners 
   scream at her, &quot;You slept with a black man!&quot;), Breck lets 
   her live with him in his mountain home and they eventually fall in 
   love. During the funeral for the dead KKK member (which is attended 
   by nearly the entire white population of the county, not to mention 
   the media), Garth picks-off some more Klan members with a 
   high-powered rifle, which leads to all kinds of pandemonium. When 
   Breck's friend, Loretta Sykes (Lola Falana; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Lady Cocoa">LADY
    COCOA</A></B> - 1974), is beaten-up and raped by Track's deputy, 
   Butt Cutt Cates (Cameron Mitchell), Breck finds out that his friend 
   Track may not be so neutral after all. The question is, which side is

   mountain home when he refuses to side with the rednecks at the rally. 
   Breck is forced to put aside his pacifist ways and take up arms with 
   Track and Garth as they battle the multitude of white-hooded 
   interlopers armed with guns and torches. In a surprising turn of 
   events, only Garth is left standing in the end.&nbsp; Man, I miss the 
   70's. At least we have films like this to remind us how politically 
   incorrect that decade really was. This film is about as politically 
   incorrect as they come, even if the script, by Millard Kaufman and 
   the late, great Samuel Fuller (who was also slated to direct, but 
   walked-off the project when the studio demanded changes in his 
   script, specifically Lee Marvin's character, who was originally a KKK 
   leader and not a sheriff), is peppered with self-righteous speeches 
   about racial equality and depictions of the Klan as male-castrating, 
   women-raping thugs. Make no mistake, though, this film's heart is 
   firmly <A HREF="klansman_1974b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/klansman belgian poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="171" HEIGHT="231" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>entrenched
    in the seedier elements of exploitation, as women are raped and 
   beaten, people are shot and nearly every white male in the town 
   utters the word &quot;nigger&quot; at least once in every sentence of 
   dialogue. What I find hilarious is that <B><A HREF="klansman_1974b.htm">THE
    KLANSMAN</A></B> was directed by a Brit, genre vet Terence Young (<B><A HREF="cold_sweat_1970.htm">COLD
    SWEAT</A></B> - 1970; <B><A HREF="valachi_papers_1972.htm">THE

   actor Richard Burton as a gimpy, alcoholic Southern landowner who 
   only gets animated once the &quot;stupid rednecks&quot; kill his dog. 
   Granted, Burton portraying an alcoholic was not much of a stretch, 
   but he basically sleepwalks through his role here and his Southern 
   accent comes and goes, sometimes in the same sentence. Watching 
   Burton's &quot;judo&quot; fight with Cameron Mitchell, where he sends 
   Mitchell clear across the room and through a door with a simple slap 
   to his face, is a thing of unintentional hilarity, though. Lee Marvin 
   is just as sleepy (both he and Burton were drunk most of the time 
   while filming and would often get into fistfights with each other 
   after the camera stopped rolling), so it's up to the amazing cast of 
   character actors to carry the day. And what a cast: Cameron Mitchell, 
   David Huddleston, Hoke Howell, Luciana Paluzzi, Vic Perrin (the voice 
   of &quot;Control&quot; in the original <B><A HREF="outer_limits_tv_series_1963.htm">OUTER
    LIMITS</A></B> TV series), David Ladd, Virgil Frye, Lee De Broux, 
   Jeannie Bell and, of course, O.J. Simpson, who we see is very 
   proficient with shotguns and rifles (Too bad he didn't use a knife 
   here. It may have gotten him convicted.). Be aware that the DVD put 
   out by Passion Productions is edited for nudity, violence and foul 
   language but, strangely, leaves the word &quot;nigger&quot; unscathed 
   throughout. The only violence missing seems to be the rapes and the 
   castration scenes, which makes me wonder: This couldn't possibly be a 
   TV edit, so just what purpose does this edit serve? The mind boggles. 
   Paramount Pictures (who released this theatrically) must have liked 
   what they saw, because they would release and even more exploitative 
   slave drama, <B><A HREF="mandingo_1975.htm">MANDINGO</A></B>, the

   Troy's live-in girlfriend Jasmine (Wendy Barry). She goes to Carlos' 
   hangout (One member says, &quot;Hey Carlos, Troy's nuts are 
   here!&quot;) and conspires with him to bring Troy and the Knights 
   down. Carlos has the police hassle the Knights and enters Jasmine in 
   the music competition (that should teach Troy!). Mr. Delamo doesn't

   Royal Rockers compete against the city's best unsigned bands,

   Carlos shoots and kills Jasmine and there's a big rumble in the

   neon-soaked music video, it because director Dominic Orlando was 
   responsible for music videos for the likes of Berlin, Kansas, Diana 
   Ross, Celine Dion and New Kids On The Block. Besides the film being 
   severely dated with 80's music, dancing, fashion and dialogue

   Blow, K.C. (of The Sunshine Band), Smokey Robinson and Deney Terrio

   was trying to purposely ruin the film) and an unrealistic view of 
   streetlife during the 80's. Every aspect of life depicted in this 
   film is a fantasy, which would be fine if the screenplay (by star 
   Leon Isaac Kennedy, who also starred in the <B><A HREF="penitentiary_films.htm">PENITENTIARY</A></B> 
   trilogy) didn't try to convince us that this is the way life really 
   was (the film's idea of poignancy is showing a streetperson missing 
   an arm). The music competition is a joke because the only two bands 
   we see perform are Troy's and Jasmine's (What kind of contest is 
   that?), as is the final rumble, where everyone uses breakdancing 
   moves when they fight each other. Believe it or not, this actually 
   got a major theatrical release and did quite well. But, unlike fine 
   wine, this hasn't aged very well. It's like looking in your high 
   school yearbook and being embarassed of the way you looked and 
   dressed. What seemed appropriate back then makes you say &quot;What 
   was I thinking?&quot; now. The only good thing about this film is 
   Janine Turner. Even with 80's big hair and fashions, she's a stunner 
   to look at. Also starring Floyd Levine, Stoney Jackson, John

   around a fire in the beginning of the film, the head of her latest 
   victim impaled on a stick and his cooked flesh eaten in an act of 
   cannibalism). We quickly learn just why Christine hates milirary men 
   when, in an extended flashback, we see her being raped by her 
   commanding officer, Colonel Maxim (James Luisi), when she refuses his 
   advances. She brings charges and he is put on trial for court 
   martial, but Colonel Maxim is exonerated when Christine's Army 
   boyfriend, John (Deon Stewardson), lies on the stand after being 
   threatened by Maxim with a not-so-plum reassignment. Not only was her 
   military career destroyed, Christine also lost her virginity to Maxim 
   on that fateful day. She has spent the following years killing all

   men so far and she has saved Maxim (who raped her <A HREF="lethal_woman_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/lethal woman vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="131" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>again
    at gunpoint after the trial, just to show her he could) for her 
   final victim. Together, with right-hand woman Tory (Gene Simmons 
   sperm recepticle Shannon Tweed) and her squad of female warriors, 
   Christine (who now uses the name Diana) has Maxim come to the island 
   under the pretext of a hunting and sex party, only Maxim doesn't yet 
   know that he's the one soon to be hunted. Christine makes the mistake 
   of allowing one more military man on the island to be hunted, Major 
   Derek Johnson (John Lipton), who briefly met Christine shortly before 
   she was raped. She is unaware that Derek was pulled out of retirement 
   to stop her from killing any more men. Christine's hatred of men gets 
   the best of her (she's quite deranged, actually), so when she and her 
   all-female court of law convict Maxim of rape, she sets him loose in 
   her jungle paradise and hunts him down with a compound bow, shooting 
   arrows into both of his legs, poking his eyes out with her earrings 
   (!) and then finishing him off with a knife to the stomach. She 
   should have stopped there, because when Derek arrives on the island 
   and proves to be a decent human being (as well as a formidable 
   opponent), Tory falls in love with him and begins to see his side of 
   things. Christine catches wind of it and imprisons Tory in the 
   dungeon while she and her warriors hunt Derek in the jungle. Derek 
   manages to turn the tables and takes on Christine (with an assist 
   from Tory) in a final fight to the death.&nbsp; Although nothing 
   exceptional, <B>LETHAL WOMAN</B> (originally known as <B><A HREF="most_dangerous_woman_alive_1988.htm">THE
    MOST DANGEROUS WOMAN ALIVE</A></B>) is a pretty watchable 
   exploitationer, thanks to tons of female flesh (but, surprisingly, 
   very little nudity), some good location scenery and decent gore and 
   action set-pieces. I love the way everyone mocks Derek's stature 
   (they all say to him, &quot;You're such a little guy!&quot;), yet he 
   always surprises them all with his quickness and agility. There's a 
   scene where, once on the island (where Derek, and we, learn that all 
   the women there, including Tory, were raped at one time), Derek 
   watches a facially-scarred woman take on five other women (including 
   Tory) in hand-to-hand combat and defeats them all easily with her 
   cold-hearted demeanor. When Christine tells Derek to take her on, we 
   expect a good, prolonged fight, but Derek immediately catches her 
   off-guard with his good manners and knocks her out with a rolled-up 
   magazine in less than two seconds. This film follows the plot of <B>THE
    MOST DANGEROUS GAME</B> (the novel as well as the original 1932 
   film) rather closely, as we see Christine's &quot;Trophy Room&quot;, 
   which is full of her male victims' severed heads and a prolonged 
   hunter vs. hunted-turned-hunter finale. Model Merete Van Kamp reminds 
   the viewer of a less-busty Sybil Danning and the acting by the rest 
   of the cast is passable, if a little overwrought in places 
   (especially from some of Christine's female warriors). Like I said, 
   it's nothing special, but there's some fun to be had if you're a fan 
   of films in this genre. I've certainly seen much worse. The

    CIGARS</A><A NAME="LittleCigars1973"></A> (1973) -</B> In the 
   beginning of this PG-rated crime comedy, conwoman/callgirl Cleo 
   (Angel Tompkins; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Bees1978">THE BEES</A></B> 
   - 1978) extinguishes a cigar on crime boss Travers' (Joe DeSantis) 
   penis and then robs him of all his jewelry and money, making a quick 
   getaway out of town before Travers' two goons can find her and bring 
   her back to him. Sporting a short brunette wig to cover her long 
   blonde hair, Cleo takes a job as a waitress at a rundown diner, where 
   she meets dwarf customers Slick Bender (Billy Curtis; <B><A HREF="high_plains_drifter_1973.htm">HIGH
    PLAINS DRIFTER</A></B> - 1973) and Cadillac (Jerry Maren; <B><A HREF="side_show_1981.htm">SIDE

    put on a traveling vaudeville and burlesque show (it's really bad) 
   that is nothing but a scam to occupy the audience while the little 
   guys steal items from their cars. Cleo takes in the show and is quick 
   to discover the midgets' scam (It takes one to know one) when she 
   notices that her gun is missing from her car. Cleo and Slick form an 
   alliance when Travers' two goons, Faust (Jon Cedar; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DayOfAnimals1976">DAY
    OF THE ANIMALS</A></B> - 1976) and Ganz (Philip Kenneally), show up 
   at the diner and Cleo fires a slug into Ganz's arm (She cracks enough 
   short jokes to fill a book and Slick reciprocates by teasing her 
   about her height, but things get serious<A HREF="little_cigars_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/little cigars mob poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="199" HEIGHT="299" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   when Cleo calls Slick a &quot;dwarf&quot;. He grabs her arm and tells 
   her that he's a &quot;midget&quot; and when she asks what's the 
   difference, he simply says, &quot;A broken arm&quot;.). Cleo has her 
   car painted a different color and joins Slick's troupe, helping the 
   little guys bilk money from their hick audience (by picking their 
   pockets while selling them magical candy bars guaranteed to increase 
   their sex drive!). Cleo soon grows tired of the nickel-and-dime 
   action (She tells Slick, &quot;I guess being small means thinking 
   small. Hell, you can't even steal big!&quot;) and longs for the days 
   of fancy hotels and expensive clothes, so she leaves Slick to find a 
   &quot;big man&quot;. Slick finds her at a bar and beats the crap out 
   of the normal-sized guy she is with, which impresses Cleo. After they 
   both rob the bar (and become lovers), Cleo and Slick decide to go 
   into big time crime and begin robbing establishments with the help of 
   the other four miniature sidekicks. Their first job is robbing a 
   garage (late genre vet Michael Pataki [<B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Grave Vampire">GRAVE
    OF THE VAMPIRE</A></B> - 1972] plays the garage mechanic), followed 
   by a movie theater heist (which is showing the Warren Oates-starrer <B><A HREF="dillinger_1973.htm">DILLINGER</A></B> 
   - 1973) and a laundry robbery (where the vertically challenged 
   quintet use their lack of height to their advantage), with Cleo 
   donning various disguises as their getaway driver. Things take a turn 
   for the worse when Faust and Ganz track down Cleo, forcing Slick and 
   his gang to kill them to protect her. They can all see the writing on 
   the wall (Cleo is captured by the police, but is rescued by the 
   midgets), so they plan one more big heist, a bank robbery, after 
   which they all plan to go on their separate ways. The robbery is 
   botched and a cowardly Cleo and a pissed-off Slick leave their four 
   comrades behind to shoot it out with the police while they head to 
   San Francisco. The finale shows why you should never betray a little 
   person, as Cadillac, Monty, Hugo and Frankie pay a surprise visit to 
   Slick and Cleo in their hotel room and teach them a lesson they will 
   never forget.&nbsp; This comedy caper, directed by Chris Cristenberry 
   (a director of 70's American episodic TV; this being his only feature 
   film) and written by Louis Garfinkle and Frank Ray Perelli (who both 
   also wrote the screenplay for <B><A HREF="doberman_gang_1972.htm">THE 
   DOBERMAN GANG</A></B> - 1972), is a fun and breezy genre film that is 
   not as cheesy or as exploitative as it sounds. It doesn't pander when 
   it comes to the midgets, as they are portrayed as living, breathing 
   human beings and not caricatures. They have the same traits as 
   &quot;normal&quot; people, both good and bad, only they have to put 
   up with constants stares, height jokes and pats on the head by nearly 
   everyone they come across (Some of their verbal comebacks are 
   priceless, though). Billy Curtis is very good as Slick, the leader of 
   the midget conmen; a gruff, no-nonsense individual who has a 
   psychological hold on the other midgets and really loves Cleo (And 
   who couldn't love the beautiful Angel Tompkins, one of the best 
   unsung actresses of the 70's?). There are some laugh-out-loud moments 
   here, including a police line-up of midgets and dwarves (one of them 
   played by Angelo Rossito; <B><A HREF="dracula_vs_frankenstein_1971.htm">DRACULA
    VS. FRANKENSTEIN</A></B> - 1971) and a late night holdup of a 
   business where the police refuse to shoot the midgets because they 
   believe they are children! There are also some serious moments, such 
   as the deaths of Faust and Ganz and the poignant finale, where love 
   wins out after all. <B><A HREF="little_cigars_1973b.htm">LITTLE CIGARS</A></B> 
   (advertised as <B><A HREF="little_cigars_1973.htm">THE LITTLE CIGARS MOB</A></B> 
   on posters and ad mats, but not on the actual film prints) is a 
   satisfying slice of 70's exploitation, the kind of entertainment they 
   (sadly) just don't make anymore. If you want to watch little people 
   go about their business today, you have to watch a reality series on 
   The Learning Channel or catch them being exploited at a circus. As 
   far as I can tell, this film (released theatrically by American 
   International Pictures) has never had a legitimate home video release 
   in the United States. My copy was sourced from a recording taken from 
   pay cable station Showtime. <B>Rated PG</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

    SOULS</A><A NAME="LostSouls1980"></A> (1980) -</B> Here's a Hong 
   Kong Shaw Brothers production that opens with an impassioned plea for 
   the plight of illegal immigrants escaping from oppressive Mainland 
   China to the free society of (a pre-1997) Hong Kong and then proceeds 
   to pile-on the sleaze for the next 90 minutes. A group of illegals 
   try to sneak into Hong Kong by swimming to it's shores (aided and 
   abetted by inflated condoms attached to their bodies!), hoping to 
   fall into a 72 hour grace period (where the government will allow 
   anyone amnesty before the mandated October 24, 1980 deadline) and 
   then heading to the legendary city of Diamond Hill, where life is 
   prosperous for everyone, only to encounter degradation after 
   degradation at the hands of profiteers, smugglers and others out to 
   exploit them. The swimmers, led by Tung, finally hitch a ride on an 
   overcrowded boat full of other illegals, but when they make it to 
   shore under the cover of darkness, the leader of the boat people 
   won't let Tung, Dai Chung and his sister Chuen follow them. That 
   decision is a double-edged sword, as all the boat people are captured 
   by the cops (who were expecting them) and our trio is taken in by an 
   old man and his two sons. The old man, it turns out, is as crooked as 
   a hillbilly's teeth. He calls-up Dai Chung and Chuen's uncle, Luk 
   Shang Heng, and demands $15,000 for the safe return of the trio. When 
   Uncle Heng shows up with only $10,0<A HREF="lost_souls_1980.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/lost souls 1980 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="196" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>00,
    the old man will only allow two to be set free. Tung tells Dai Chung 
   and Chuen to go, but when Tung has the opportunity to escape, he 
   takes it. The old man grabs Dai Chung and Chuen in retribution and 
   locks them in a shed. Tung returns to rescue his comrades, but a 
   series of events finds Dai Chung getting his leg ensnared in a steel 
   trap and taken captive by human smuggler Fatty, while Tung and Chuen 
   are captured by rival smuggler Mr, Hok and his rape-happy gang (The 
   sadistic Mr. Hok, who is crippled and walks with a cane, is seen 
   pouring hot candle wax over some poor naked woman's body and then 
   turning her over to his gang for some rape antics). This is when the 
   film turns really nasty and unpleasant, as Chuen is graphically 
   gang-raped in front of Tung (after covering her body in human waste), 
   Mr. Hok and his gang attack Fatty's camp and capture the illegals 
   (setting the ones they don't want on fire by pouring gasoline over 
   their bodies), and everyone is stripped naked (including young 
   children) on Mr. Hok's orders and forced to watch a young woman being 
   burned alive with gasoline for refusing to strip. After too much 
   degradation, rape and torture to catalogue in a simple review, the 
   captives become the captors and mete out revenge to those that 
   wronged them (including a torture lifted directly from <B><A HREF="caligula_1979.htm">CALIGULA</A></B> 
   [1979]). I'm afraid it ends up badly for everyone involved, as all 
   the illegals are captured by the police except Tung, who finally 
   reaches his destination of Diamond Hill, only to discover that it is 
   one of the worst slums in Hong Kong. Another immigrant dream shot to 
   hell.&nbsp; While this film pretends to be a serious indictment 
   against the abuse of illegal immigrants, it's quite apparent to see 
   that director Mou Tun-Fei (better known on our shores as &quot;T.F. 
   Mous&quot; of <B><A HREF="men_behind_the_sun_1988.htm">MEN BEHIND THE SUN</A></B> 
   [1988] infamy) was aiming no higher than a graphic exploitationer. 
   Though the film starts out relatively tame, it progressively gets 
   worse and worse, as director Tun-Fei doesn't forego any chance to 
   display every exploitative element imaginable, showing both male and 
   female full-frontal nudity, unpleasant scenes of rape, too much 
   degradation to keep track of and plenty of graphic violence. The 
   misogyny in this film is unrelenting, as women are repeatedly raped, 
   manhandled and, in one case, treated like cattle when a man with a 
   huge potbelly haggles with Mr. Hok over the price of individual naked 
   women in Hok's stable, with the agreed-on price of each woman written 
   on their asses in red lipstick and the final price tallied-up with a 
   calculator after the bidding is over. It should come as no surprise 
   to anyone to learn later on in the film that Mr. Hok is a brutal 
   homosexual (which would explain why many of his male gang members 
   wear tight short-shorts or parade around in their underwear for much 
   of the film); his gang presenting him the naked, hog-tied body of Dai 
   Chung as a birthday gift (wrapped in a white sheet and red bow!). Mr. 
   Hok wastes no time greasing-up Dai Chung's asshole with Vaseline and 
   butt-fucking him, which leads to Dai Chung biting Mr. Hok on the neck 
   and refusing to let go until they are both dead (Hok by punctured 
   carotid artery and Dai Chung by an extensive beating by Hok's goons). 
   Instead of being upset, Hok's gang argue about who is going to be the 
   next big boss! While this is nowhere near as graphic as Mou Tun-Fei's 
   previously-mentioned <B>MEN BEHIND THE SUN</B> or it's third sequel, <B><A HREF="black_sun_the_nanking_massacre_1995.htm">BLACK
    SUN: THE NANKING MASSACRE</A></B> (1995), <B>LOST SOULS</B> still 
   contains a lot of stuff that demands a strong stomach or, at least,

   exploitation genre. You should know by now whether this film is your 
   cup of tea or not. Starring Yen Hung, Chi Feng, Chen Ming, Chan Shen,

   the most fucked-up and politically incorrect films ever made. In 
   other words, I loved it! It's got murder, rape, an overage motorcycle 
   gang who wear swastika armbands, dubbing that sounds like it was 
   recorded by asylum inmates, intestine-fondling and swing dancing! Hal 
   (Robert O'Neal) and his virgin girlfriend are sitting in his Corvette 
   Stingray at a red light when they are hassled by a balding dude and 
   his motorcycle gang. Hal speeds off and, in the chase, one of the 
   gang members is killed when he crashes into a parked car. Thinking 
   nothing of it, Hal and his girlfriend go to a disco (where people are 
   swing dancing!), get drunk and leave. In the parking lot, Hal is 
   knocked-out and his girlfriend is raped by the gang (the bald guy 
   sticks a finger in her vagina and rubs the virgin blood on her 
   nose!). The next day, Hal has his martial arts buddies disrupt the 
   gang's funeral for their fallen comrade and beat the shit <A HREF="mad_foxes_1981d.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mad foxes dvd front small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>out
    of them (in one of the lamest exhibits of martial arts ever filmed). 
   Hal then has one of his buddies cut off the bald guy's penis and 
   shove it in his mouth! Later on, the gang goes to the martial arts 
   school, throw a grenade into the classroom and run in, guns blazing. 
   After killing all the students, Stileto (Erik Falk), the new gang 
   leader, tortures the teacher for Hal's address and then shoves a 
   knife in his heart (He says, &quot;Keep my knife as a souvenier and 
   as a reward, here's a cigar!&quot;). The gang goes to Hal's home, but 
   he escapes in his Stingray, the gang following close behind. Hal 
   finds time to pick up a female hitch-hiker named Lilly and then heads 
   to his rich parents' home in the country. While Hal is out fucking 
   Lilly in a field, the bikers invade the home and kill everyone 
   inside. When Hal finds is mother and father brutally murdered, he 
   vows revenge. He tracks down the bikers one-by-one and kills them all 
   (My favorite is when he finds Stileto on the toilet and drops a 
   grenade between his legs as the camera focuses on Stileto's penis 
   before the grenade explodes!). Hal drives home, only to find the 
   castrated bald dude waiting in his apartment holding a bomb. It's an 
   expolsive conclusion.&nbsp; It's hard to put into mere words how 
   insane and off-center this Spanish film really is. While it's 
   basically a yo-yo dance between Hal and the biker gang to see who can 
   get the best of who, it is full of full frontal nudity (both male and 
   female, with male nudity getting the most screen time) that at times 
   borders on hardcore and crammed with violence that almost goes beyond 
   the call of good taste (I dare any man to watch the castration scene 
   and not cross your legs!). A lot of reviewers compare this to <B><A HREF="last_house_on_the_left2.htm">LAST
    HOUSE ON THE LEFT</A></B> (1972), but they couldn't be more wrong. 
   Where <B>HOUSE</B> had an atmosphere of terror and dread from nearly 
   the first frame, <B><A HREF="mad_foxes_1981c.htm">MAD FOXES</A></B> 
   does the exact opposite. The gang of bikers are almost a joke as they 
   keep falling off their bikes, walk around naked in public or just act 
   stupidly (I'm sure a lot of it was lost in the crazy dubbing). Even 
   when they invade the parents' home and kill the gardener with hedge 
   shears, shoot the cook, machine gun the father, shoot the 
   wheelchair-bound mother in the head (her chair rolls backwards and 
   then tips over!) and then eviscerate the maid and play with her 
   intestines, it's all played braodly and builds no tension at all. 
   It's all shown matter-of-factly. It also doesn't help that Robert 
   O'Neal (real name: Jose Gras), as Hal, has the emotional range of a 
   piece of granite and makes a really stiff hero (he's really no hero 
   at all). This film is best viewed as a comedy, although I highly 
   doubt it was made that way. Something got lost in the translation, 
   but I think we are all better off for it. The violence and nudity are 
   extreme and the laughable dubbing will make you shake your head in 
   disbelief. Seek this one out. Directed by Paul Grau (using the name 
   &quot;Paul Gray&quot;) and produced by exploitation master Erwin C.

   breasts I've ever seen on a grown woman), unbelievable situations and 
   hysterical dialogue. When Kim's mother wonders where she's getting 
   all her money, Kim says matter-of-factly, &quot;I'm doing relief 
   work.&quot; (I nearly had to change my pants!). The turn the plot 
   takes when Kim becomes a hitwoman is so off-the-wall and out of left 
   field (She says, &quot;I'm serious. DEAD serious!&quot; when she 
   kills her second victim.), that it takes the film to a whole new 
   level. This is by no means a good film, as it is badly acted, poorly 
   filmed and looks like it was edited with a chainsaw, but it is 
   unusual and unintentionally funny, such as the scene where she gives 
   the elderly hard-of-hearing high school principal, Mr. Elmhurst (John 
   Harmon), a heart attack (Mr. Donaldson tells Kim, just before she 
   goes to the principal's office, &quot;You can screw the teachers, but 
   you can't screw the school!&quot;). She lures the Mr. Elmhurst to her 
   home, steals his heart medication and then shoves her breasts into 
   his face, causing him to stroke out and die (She says to him as he's

   that Becky is nothing but a cocktease, strutting around in a white 
   bikini, tempting and tormenting stepdaddy George (John Dennis) until 
   he nearly rapes her, but is stopped when Becky's mother, Mama Love 
   (Gloria Grahame; <B><A HREF="nesting_1980.htm">THE NESTING</A></B> - 
   1980), catches him in the act. Mama Love shames George into writing a 
   letter confessing his sins and then has Becky drug his drink and lure 
   him into the bathroom, where Mama Love, Becky and sister Addie 
   (Sondra Currie; <B><A HREF="lee frost.htm#Policewomen">POLICEWOMEN</A></B> 
   - 1974) hold him down in a bathtub and slit his wrists with a strait 
   razor. They make it look like a suicide by placing the confessional 
   letter he just wrote next to the blood-filled tub. Mama Love and her 
   girls, which also includes na&iuml;ve step-sister Cindy (Mary 
   Stoddard), are in for a rude awakening when they discover that George 
   was actually flat-broke (When Mama L<A HREF="mamas_dirty_girls_1974b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mama's dirty girls poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="318" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>ove
    finds out that George was only renting the huge home they were 
   living in, she tells her girls, &quot;Remember, a man is only a man, 
   but property is security!&quot; A wise, wise woman.), so they now 
   have to find another rich man to take advantage of and, eventually, 
   murder. We then switch over to Sheriff Roy Collins (Christopher 
   Lofton, here billed as &quot;Christopher Wines&quot;), who we first 
   see screwing his wife Charity (Annekade de Lorenzo) and the demanding 
   a divorce (!), as he pulls Mama Love and her girls over for speeding. 
   He talks them into staying in his dinky little town (Roy and Addie 
   immediately make eye contact) and has them stay at a health resort 
   run by widower Harold (Paul Lambert). When Mama Love finds out that 
   Harold is well off (&quot;Oh, a man of property!&quot;), the 
   overnight stay turns into an extended one. Mama Love puts the moves 
   on Harold, while Addie and Roy hook-up, Cindy meets nice guy Paul 
   (Dennis Smith) and Becky cockteases Willy (Joseph Anthony), the 
   hulking, halfwit groundskeeper. Complications arise when Mama Love 
   marries Harold, not realizing that Harold is actually a cold-blooded 
   killer. Not only did he drown his first wife and make it look like an 
   accident, we watch as he also kills a hobo with an axe after the hobo 
   tells Harold that he saw him murder his wife. What happens next is 
   far too complex to explain in a short review. Needless to say, people 
   get their comeuppance, a fortune in hidden jewels comes into play and 
   nearly everyone has sex.&nbsp; This totally entertaining 
   sexploitation flick, directed with a sure hand by John Hayes (<B><A HREF="cut-throats_1969.htm">THE

   - 1973), is a fun, sexy thriller that contains so much nudity and 
   sex, you'll think you've died and gone to Heaven. Half the fun of 
   this film, though, is watching Harold and Mama Love trying to kill 
   each other in a series of staged &quot;accidents&quot;, neither of 
   them aware that the other is actually a cold-blooded murderer. As a 
   matter of fact, no one here, with the exception of Cindy and Paul, 
   can be considered remotely sympathetic in any way. Addie and Roy 
   murder Charity so they can be together and pin the crime on Paul; 
   Becky does her bikini tease routine on Willy one too many times until 
   he can't stand it anymore (Hey, even mentally-challenged morons need 
   some nookie every now and then!); and Mama and Harold continue their 
   love/hate relationship. One gets the feeling when watching this that

   Carlin/Lansky production <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Blood And Lace">BLOOD

   he will deal with it in his usual violent manner. Unfortunately for 
   Frank, Katie's massage parlor becomes a smashing success and turns a 
   good profit, so Katie makes Liz and Mo equal partners. Frank and 
   Katie become romantically involved, which puts Frank in quite the 
   pickle, because Godfather Vito (Dan Seymour) orders Carlo to make 
   Katie's business part of his stable immediately, so Carlo sends 
   violent goon Harry (Wayne Storm) to bust up the joint (he also gives 
   Liz a painful bear hug!). When Katie finally listens to the 
   audiotapes and discovers that Frank is a mobster, she breaks off the 
   romance. Carlo goes off to kill Katie while Harry holds Frank 
   prisoner. Frank breaks free and tries to save Katie, but the police 
   grab him for questioning (When Frank gives a statement, he says, 
   &quot;You, Detective Buckley, are an ignorant clown that doesn't know

   [1974]), is chock-full of both male and female nudity and some bloody 
   violence, but the film is technically sloppy. The very first scene in 
   the film, during the face-off between Leo and Carlo, Leo mistakenly 
   calls Carlo &quot;Leo&quot; in a line of dialogue. It's a glaring 
   error that could have easily been fixed with a bit of looping. There 
   are also camera and microphone shadows in several scenes. The film 
   also spends too much of it's 87 minute running time detailing the 
   individual personal lives of the three female characters and not 
   enough time on the crime aspects. While these scenes give the ladies 
   an excuse to disrobe (always a good thing!), the plotlines are 
   boring, from Liz's relationship with disinterested painter Gavin (Tom 
   McDonald), Mo's affair with shy, skinny black customer Elliot (Peter 
   Fitzsimmons) and Katie's romance with Frank. There are a few 
   redeeming scenes, especially Carlo's cold-blooded reactions to all 
   those he perceives as his enemies, but more often than not, this film 
   just plods along to it's completely unrealistic conclusion, where 
   Godfather Vito sides with Katie and decides to turn all his 
   whorehouses into legitimate massage parlors! C'mon now! Does he have 
   Alzheimer's? If you like nudity, <B><A HREF="invasion_bee_girls3.htm">THE

   because it is the only flick that I haven't seen that features 
   Brother Theodore (but more on that later on). The film open with an 
   apprehensive man (played by co-director Chester Fox) paying a massage 
   parlor chick money for an actual massage and then slipping her a 
   couple of twenties to take off her top and shorts. He can't go 
   through with having sex with her because he feels guilty about 
   cheating on his wife, so he leaves. The credits then roll (You know 
   you are in for something special when the first credits to appear on 
   screen are &quot;A Cinamid 'Flim' Production&quot;!) and we then see 
   New York City Detective Jimmy Rivera (George Spencer) just after 
   having sex with a pretty massage girl and getting dressed, then 
   meeting his partner, Detective Danny O'Mara (John Moser), downstairs 
   in their unmarked police car. Jimmy then goes home to his religious, 
   strait-laced wife, who complains when Jimmy puts his gun on the 
   kitchen table (Being a good wife, though, the first thing she does is 
   hand him a can of Budweiser!). A short time later, that same massage 
   girl is murdered by an unseen john wearing latex gloves. He smashes 
   her face into a mirror and strangles her. Jimmy and Danny investigate 
   the murder and discover that the victim is Jimmy's weekly hooker 
   date. Danny goes to meet the dead hooker's roommate Gwen (Sandra 
   Peabody, a.k.a. &quot;Sandra Cassel&quot; of <B><A HREF="last_house_on_the_left2.htm">LAST
    HOUSE ON THE LEFT</A></B> - 1972), who tells Danny that all she does 
   is give massages with no sex and it is love at first sight (Check out 
   the wallpaper in Gwen's apartment!). Gwen tells Danny that her 
   roommate had a weekly session with a man she called &quot;Mr. 
   Creepy&quot; (a surprising early appearance by the great character 
   actor George Dzundza, who starred in the first season of TV's <B><A HREF="law_order_tv_series.htm">LAW
    &amp; ORDER</A></B> [1990 - 1991] and was also Assistant Director of 
   this film) and that after coming home after meeting him, her roommate 
   was full of bruises. After getting his real name from the dead 
   roommate's datebook, Jimmy and Danny stake him out and chase him when 
   they spot him following a woman walking on the street. Jimmy kicks 
   the shit out of him, but just as they are about to arrest him, they 
   get a call on the radio that another massage girl (from a different 
   parlor) has been killed, this time asphyxiated and having acid poured 
   on her breasts and stomach by the same psycho. All the men who 
   handled the psycho's money before he supposedly had sex with the 
   girls can only describe him as a well-dressed man with no 
   distinguishing features. Jimmy and Danny visit a crazy astrologist 
   who they think could be the murderer (played by wacky [and personal 
   favorite] Brother Theodore [<B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DevilsExpress1975">DEVIL'S
    EXPRESS</A></B> - 1975; <B><A HREF="porno horror.htm#Gums1976">GUMS</A></B> 
   - 1976], who says such nonsense things as, &quot;It is more important 
   to go to Heaven than to go to the Moon!&quot;, &quot;When I listen to 
   rock and roll, my ears bleed!&quot; and &quot;It is my sincere wish 
   that immediately after my death, my head be severed from my body and 
   replaced by a bouquet of broccoli!&quot;), but they cross him off 
   their suspect list when he tells them he was being treated in the 
   hospital for ulcers at the time of the murders. More massage girls 
   are murdered (one is strangled with a towel) from different parlors, 
   while Danny and Gwen continue their romance, first going to a nude 
   indoor pool orgy (with surprising full-frontal male nudity), having a 
   picnic in the park and walking through Times Square (where we can see 
   posters and theater marquees for such films as <B><A HREF="seven_golden_men_1965.htm">SEVEN

   wife are at church listening to a priest preach about the Seven 
   Deadly Sins, it hits Jimmy that all the massage parlors that the 
   girls have been murdered in have the name of one of those sins (I 
   wonder if the writers of <B><A HREF="se7en_1995.htm">SE7EN</A></B> 
   [1995] saw this film?) and the word &quot;Lust&quot; is next on the 
   list. They go to a massage parlor with that word in their title, only 
   for Danny and Jimmy to discover that Gwen has been brutally murdered, 
   her throat cut and her body hanging upside down. They then go to the 
   next massage parlor on the list, where the religious fanatic killer 
   is about to murder the same hooker we saw in the beginning of the 
   film with the apprehensive man, but she manages to throw a bowl of 
   rubbing alcohol on him and sets him on fire. As Jimmy and Danny bust 
   down the door, all they see is the killer being burned alive (Jimmy 
   pumps a couple of bullets into him just for the hell of it), his 
   flaming hand sticking up in the air as he screams his last 
   breath.&nbsp; While not a good film by any stretch of the 
   imagination, <B><A HREF="massage_parlor_murders_1973b.htm">MASSAGE 
   PARLOR MURDERS!</A></B> (later retitled <B><A HREF="massage_parlor_hookers_1973.htm">MASSAGE
    PARLOR HOOKERS</A></B>; it plays for many years under that title on 
   double and triple bills up till the mid-80's), it is a great time 
   capsule for old fogeys like me who remember when Times Square was 
   littered with porn (and normal) theaters, adult book stores and 
   hookers as far as they eye could see. This area was destroyed in the 
   mid-80s when the Walt Disney Corporation &quot;regentrified&quot; 
   Times Square as a family-friendly zone. Not much remains of its 
   original gritty glory, so watching this film brought back many fond 
   nostalgic memories. While co-director Chester Fox hasn't done 
   anything of note as far as genre films go (this is his only film), 
   other co-director Alex Stevens is a well-known stuntman, stunt 
   coordinator and bit actor, working on such films as <B><A HREF="#Death Hooker">WHO
    KILLED MARY WHATS'ERNAME?</A></B> (1971), <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Dion Brothers">THE

    U.S.A.</A></B> (1985) and <B><A HREF="hidden_1987.htm">THE HIDDEN</A></B> 
   (1987), although this film was his only directorial effort. Stevens 
   was responsible for directing the film's lengthy car chase (where 
   Danny, clad only in a towel, steals a cab and chases a suspect, 
   strikes several cars and then smashes the cab, only to discover that 
   the man he is chasing is not their man [but he had two kilos of 
   herion in his car, so Danny is off the hook!]), the pool orgy and 
   Danny and Gwen's walk through Times Square. As per Chris Poggiali's 
   liner notes, it is obvious that some of these scenes were filmed 
   sometime in early 1974, even if the film was submitted to the MPAA 
   for an R-Rating in September 1973. The pool scene alone would 
   absolutely negate the film's R-Rating (especially if they included 
   the outtakes that are part of the combo pack's supplements, most 
   notably the scene of a man with a semi-hard erection!), but they 
   didn't bother resubmitting the film and it went out with an R-rating 
   without any complaints from the audiences. The print that Vinegar 
   Syndrome uses for the transfer is in generally good condition, with 
   only a few grainy scenes, but is is not enough to distract you like 
   the terrible print they used for their release of <B><A HREF="#Suckers1972">THE
    SUCKERS</A></B> (1972). There is not much blood or gore on view (the 
   first kill and Gwen's death are the bloodiest, showing that nice 
   bright red blood that was used during the 70's), but the film doesn't 
   need it. It has a general air of sleaziness that could only have come 
   from those sexploitation films of the 70's and that's enough for me. 
   It also completes my quest to see every film the late Brother 
   Theodore appeared in (fans of David Letterman's Late Show remember 
   his guest appearances as offbeat and hilarious and I was lucky enough 
   to see his one man Off-Broadway show when I was younger), unless 
   there is some unknown hidden gem that I have never heard of. Who 
   knows, it may be out there somewhere waiting to be discovered in 
   someone's attic or basement. Also starring Anne Gaybis, Marlene

   their motorcycles. Jim rides in and saves Kim from a certain death 
   and they then try to save Kathy from being gang-raped (Kim threatens 
   the gang with a coral snake!). The finale finds Jim challenging old 
   nemesis Champ to a one-on-one fight, the winner getting Kathy. Jim

   instance of nudity and the fight scenes look to have been 
   choreographed by someone with no experience in where to place a 
   camera when a punch is thrown, as we can see the actors miss their 
   target by feet, not inches), unless all you are interested in are 
   late 60's fashions, haidos and a lousy rock band called &quot;Heros 
   Of Cranberry Farm&quot; (a band so low-rent, the couldn't afford the 
   &quot;e&quot; in &quot;Heroes&quot;), who play a tune in the middle 
   of a field at the beginning of the film. Even though there are 
   microphones on the stage, all they do is play an instrumantal tune 
   (which doesn't match what they're playing on-screen). Just more 
   filler in a film full of filler. During Penny's flashback gang-rape, 
   the camera pays more attention to two little gold-colored cherubs 
   hanging on the wall than it does to the rape itself. I supposed it 
   could be viewed as ironic symbolism, but I doubt that Grinter ever 
   aimed that high in any of his films. This film's message seems to be 
   that if you're raped, you'll spend the rest of your life as a cheap 
   hooker. Or, as Penny says, &quot;I'm a hooker. W-H-O-R-E!&quot;. The

   (Marcie is bitten on the breast by a cobra during the escape and 
   Serena sucks out the poison), but it all turns out to be a set-up by 
   Serena and Montiero. The girls still manage to escape and hook-up 
   with their pirate crew, where they get into a gun battle with 
   Montiero and his guards. When Turko and his crew suddenly appear, 
   it's a free-for-all that many will not survive.&nbsp; This strange 
   mixture of WIP (women in prison) and pirate themes comes courtesy of 
   Filipino director/producer Cirio H. Santiago and, quite frankly, it 
   doesn't make for a good mix. For a film that spends much of it's time 
   at an all-female coffee plantation/prison, there is precious little 
   nudity (just an all-too-quick prerequisite shower scene when the 
   girls arrive at the plantation). What we do get is plenty of scenes 
   where our two heroines get into lots of hinky martial arts fights and 
   it's rather obvious that stunt doubles were utilized most of the 
   time. There's also far more dialogue than usual for a Santiago film 
   (script by Cyril St. James, from a story by Santiago, who uses the 
   pseudonym &quot;Leonard Hermes&quot;) and precious little action. 
   While it is a pleasure to watch four beautiful actresses play off of 
   each other, Santiago never fully takes advantage of putting them in 
   truly exploitative situations, like long naked showers, catfights 
   and, most importantly, long naked showers. While the final gun battle 
   is violent (Jayne Kennedy's death on a suspension bridge is 
   memorable), it takes forever to get there (the film's running time of 
   82 minutes seems twice as long). I get the feeling that Santiago was 
   slumming here, as he really doesn't seem to have his heart in this 
   film. This film just rambles along and is full of so many missed 
   opportunities (like long naked showers), I just wanted to cry. I 
   expected more from Mr. Santiago. With this exceptional cast of 
   beautiful actresses, he should have made a gem of an exploitationer.

    about a doctor trying to get permission from his peers to perform 
   the first human heart transplant.&nbsp; A wealthy old woman with a 
   bad heart offers the doctor one million dollars if he will give her a 
   good heart. He has one problem: His superiors have nixed the idea of 
   human heart transplants and forbid him to do one, fearing it would 
   make people think that doctors are butchers. (I told you it was 
   dated.) When the doctor's n'er-do-well brother accidently injures a 
   girl outside a bar, he brings her to the doctor's office, where he 
   tries to save her by massaging her heart (where real open heart 
   surgery footage is shown). She dies. So why waste a perfectly good 
   young heart? The doctor performs the transplant on the wealthy old 
   woman. It is a success. But who can he tell? Meanwhile the police 
   find the body of the heartless girl. Much more goes on here, but why 
   spoil the fun? This production, filmed in Flint, Michigan, is pretty 
   awful with its' bad photography and even worse acting.&nbsp; But, in 
   a strange way, it's highly watchable. Check out the 60's hairstyles, 
   clothing and music as well as the semi-nudity and cheap gore. There 
   is also a stripper (real tame), body painting and performance art. 
   The screenplay is scattershot, as it tries to tell ten different 
   stories at the same time. It doesn't work but you can't blame them 
   for trying. For all my drug-crazed sensibilities I actually liked 
   this dog. Most reference books list this film as being made in the 
   1980's.&nbsp; They must be kidding. Starring Dick Grimm, Cal Seely

    tortures him with a safety pin until he gives up his house key and 
   information on where he hides his money. Pat has Bonnie hold him 
   hostage in the woods while she drives to Dan's house (where she 
   flashes the gardener, finds the money and steals jewelry belonging to 
   Dan's wife). Bonnie does an impromptu striptease in front of Dan and 
   then reveals that Pat's gun is nothing but a water pistol (After 
   revealing the gun is fake, Dan says to her, &quot;You know what you 
   are? A cheap little hunk of flesh! A piece of meat that's on sale for 
   a few lousy bucks!&quot;). When Dan's small dog Bebe bites Pat (dogs 
   don't seem to like her), she throws it over a cliff, killing it. When 
   she returns back to Bonnie and Dan, she threatens Dan with a (real) 
   knife and takes off without Bonnie after she finds out that she 
   revealed to Dan that the gun was fake (She says to Bonnie, 
   &quot;You're not a kitten. You're just a little pussy!&quot;). After 
   calling him her &quot;lapdog&quot;, Bonnie makes love to Dan and then 
   leaves him in the woods, still tied-up. Bonnie then hitches a ride 
   with three guys in a dune buggy and then meets lesbian artist 
   Geraldine (Joan Blackman), who takes Bonnie to her home, lets her 
   take a bubble bath and hires Bonnie as her model. They become fast 
   friends and lovers until Geraldine becomes over-protective and 
   jealous, especially when rich art collector Vincent (Ed Bishop) 
   becomes interested in puchasing Geraldine's nude portrait of Bonnie. 
   When Geraldine shoots and kills a &quot;burglar&quot; named Ron (Matt 
   Green) in a jealous rage, (he was just looking for something to eat 
   and becomes Bonnie's secret lover), Bonnie runs away and ends up at 
   Vincent's house where she learns that he is more than a collector of 
   art. He buys Bonnie expensive clothes and jewelry, feeds her special 
   ice cream made with &quot;goat's milk&quot; and keeps her caged like 
   an animal! Vincent is a collector of the female species, including 
   all species of animals as well as women and keeps them captive in his 
   &quot;zoo&quot; in his basement as &quot;pets&quot;. He invites 
   Geraldine over to his house, where he slowly begins to gain control 
   over her, eventually leading them to his basement. Bonnie gets the 
   last laugh as she traps Vincent and Geraldine together in a cage and 
   releases all the other pets. She drives off in Vincent's car and 
   picks up the first male hitch-hiker she spots. The End.&nbsp; This 
   exploitation gem contains so many references and visuals of animals, 
   the film's title takes on a whole different meaning. Everyone is 
   calling somebody some type of animal or another, whether it be &quot;lapdog<A HREF="pets_1974b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pets 1974 poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="197" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>&quot;,
    &quot;kitten&quot;, &quot;pussy&quot; and an art connoisseur (Berry 
   Kroeger) calls Vincent &quot;a strange fish&quot;. There are some 
   revealing bits of dialogue, such as when Geraldine says to Bonnie, 
   &quot;I like you best in the dark, when I can't see you. Then you are 
   as I wish you were.&quot; Pretty heady stuff for a cheap exploitation 
   film. That's not to say that this film skimps on the exploitation 
   elements. The late Candice Rialson (<B><A HREF="#MamasDirtyGirls">MAMA'S

   skimpy outfits. She comes off as half-innocent schoolgirl and 
   half-sexual temptress. Her character is really hard to pigeonhole 
   until the finale. Director/producer/co-scripter Raphael Nussbaum, who 
   also made the terrible rape/revenge film <B><A HREF="#Lethal Victims">LETHAL

   (1991), keeps things moving at a brisk and somewhat unorthodox pace. 
   The final third is especially disorientating, as Vincent invites 
   Geraldine over to his house. He says to her, &quot;You women. You 
   always have great expectations but, still, you never know what to 
   expect.&quot; and then proceeds to try and possess her. His reasoning 
   for his hatred of women needs to be heard to be believed (Part of it 
   goes, &quot;All I ask them to be is women instead of frauds!&quot;). 
   The late Ed Bishop (<B><A HREF="battle_beneath_the_earth_1968.htm">BATTLE

   into submission (He says as he's whipping Geraldine, &quot;The 
   lioness has spirit!&quot; and &quot;Show me a man that's satisfied 
   with one woman and I'll show you a liar!&quot;) without any human 
   conscience. Co-scripted by Richard Reich, based on his play of the 
   same name. I'm willing to bet that much of the colorful dialogue in 
   this film is lifted verbatim from his stage version. If you like 
   films full of nudity and animal symbolism, try tracking <B><A HREF="pets_1974c.htm">PETS</A></B> 
   down. Some advertising materials and posters tried to pass this off 
   as a WIP film. I would hate to be the audience member who thought 
   they were about to view a film in the vein of <B><A HREF="caged_heat_1974.htm">CAGED

   obvious to everyone but Keema, that Keema himself is ultimately 
   responsible for her death, as Sheriff Trask [who is not a bad guy] 
   warned Keema during the wedding reception that he was too drunk to 
   drive). Keema has flashbacks to happier days when he and his 
   bride-to-be would frolic in the mountain snow and he can still hear 
   her calling his name, but it seems the more he reminisces, the more 
   deluded and violent he gets. The quartet hole-up in a cabin occupied

   shot dead by cops at the entrance to a church (a fitting death), 
   Wilbur is captured and Keema escapes into the snow-filled mountains

   hangs one of Trask's men and then himself gets caught in a couple of 
   bear traps, Sheriff Trask stops being Mr. Nice Guy and puts a bullet 
   in Keema's head, thereby proving that old adage, &quot;The only good 
   Indian is a dead Indian&quot;.&nbsp; This early 70's crime drama, 
   originally titled <B><A HREF="devil_and_leroy_bassett_1973b.htm">THE 
   DEVIL AND LEROY BASSETT</A></B>, is enjoyable merely for the fact 
   that it gives starring roles to John Goff and George &quot;Buck&quot; 
   Flower, who were friends in real life and usually had much smaller 
   roles in the films they appeared in (many of them together). 
   Director/screenwriter/co-producer Robert E. Pearson (whose only other 
   film seems to be <B><A HREF="hawaiian_split_1971.htm">HAWAIIAN SPLIT</A></B> 
   [1971 - a.k.a. <B><A HREF="godchildren_1971.htm">THE GOD CHILDREN</A></B>])
    lets Goff and Flower's natural chemistry shine through here, as Goff 
   spouts Bible passages (but is the most violent brother) and Flower 
   plays most of his scenes drunk (either sporting the ugliest set of 
   upper false teeth or no teeth at all). The violence is brutal, but 
   restrained (this was rated PG when released to theaters), and mainly 
   consists of people getting shot or being threatened with guns (the 
   shooting of the innocent bus passenger goes way beyond of what would 
   be accepted as PG today, though). The film loses interest very 
   quickly when Goff is killed and Flower captured, mainly because Cody 
   Bearpaw has the on-screen charisma of a cigar store Indian (even Old 
   Chief Wood'nhead in <B><A HREF="creepshow_2_1987.htm">CREEPSHOW 2</A></B> 
   [1987] had more facial expressions than Mr. Bearpaw) and the film 
   turns into a standard fugitive scenario. It still gets my 
   recommendation, though, because it is one of the best examples of 
   seeing both Goff and Flower shine in larger-than-normal roles.

   for it, fuck for it, kill for it and die for it!&quot;), a black 
   radical places a time bomb at the entrance of a bank, but he is 
   spotted by a white cop and shot dead. The next morning, Carolyn and 
   Ron are standing in front of the blood-stained sidewalk where the 
   black radical was shot down and Carolyn screams about it being the 
   police's fault (&quot;Those pigs! Those lousy, rotten pigs!&quot;), 
   while Ron wonders why a black man would try to blow-up a bank with a 
   bomb (&quot;The reason has to be more important than the act.&quot;) 
   and vows to find out why. Ron is a TV news director and local black 
   lawyer (and closet radical) Randy Johnson (Herbert J. Kerr Jr.) warns 
   best friend Carolyn, &quot;One day you're going to have to choose 
   between what makes you happy and what you believe in!&quot; whe<A HREF="place_called_today_1972b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/place called today poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="299" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>n
    she tells him she loves Ron. Carolyn doesn't know that Ron is having 
   an affair with rich white bitch Cindy Cartwright (Cheri Caffaro; <B><A HREF="#Savage Sisters">SAVAGE
    SISTERS</A></B> - 1974), the daughter of rich businessman Alexander 
   Cartwright (Leo Tapp), who is a moneyman and &quot;advisor&quot; to 
   the town's current mayor, Ben Atkinson (Peter Carew). Randy has 
   political ambitions and figures that the only way he will get elected 
   for mayor is if the voters are scared of him, so he has all his 
   radical buddies (both black and white, including Carolyn) start a 
   campaign of terror and violence to get the voters to fall in line. 
   While Ron is oiling-up Cindy's naked body and screwing her brains 
   out, Randy (with Carolyn standing beside him) holds a press 
   conference where he announces that he is running for mayor as an 
   Independent, on the &quot;Equality For Everyone&quot; ticket, This 
   being the early-70's, it causes quite a stir, especially when Randy 
   promises to stop the violence plaguing the city, the same violence 
   where Randy has his radical buddies placing a few bombs around the 
   city (and killing some innocent white construction workers). If Randy 
   can make the citizens believe that only he can stop the violence and 
   killings, it will make him look like the new messiah. Ron grows 
   suspicious of Randy's candidacy and warns Carolyn not to get too 
   close to him (little knowing that he is way too late). That choice 
   Randy warned Carolyn she would have to make? It's gonna come sooner 
   than later. Pretty soon, it turns out, as the entire city experiences 
   a race war, with whites fighting blacks over the mention of Randy's 
   name. Randy has one more huge violent act for the radicals to perform 
   before he reels it all in, but politics, much like life, is a 
   vengeful bitch and Randy's political ambitions get in the way of his 
   personal views (Absolute power corrupts absolutely). It ends badly 
   for everyone, as the election draws near and it proves impossible to 
   stop the violence once it reaches the boiling point, where everyone 
   has hatred in their blood.&nbsp; This is a talky political melodrama 
   that is interrupted every so often by shots of female nudity and 
   bursts of violence. Director/screenwriter Don Schain, who also 
   directed the Ginger trilogy (<B><A HREF="ginger_1971.htm">GINGER</A></B>

   you'll be screaming for it to stop (I guess you would have had to 
   live through that period of time, which I did, to really understand 
   the politics on display here). Since we now have a black President in 
   our highest office, most of this film's political motivations are 
   rendered moot (and I think Mr. Obama would cringe at the thought of 
   winning the presidency the way Randy tries to win the mayoral race in 
   this film), but it's always nice to see Lana Wood and Cheri Caffaro

    mind now seem quaint and dated. The good news: The film oozes a 
   sleazy vibe, contains some scenes that are quite atmospheric and has 
   a winning nutso performance by William Kerwin (<B><A HREF="blood_feast_1963.htm">BLOOD
    FEAST</A></B> - 1963; he shares story credit here with brother Harry 
   Kerwin, director of such genre films as <B><A HREF="#God's Bloody Acre">GOD'S
    BLOODY ACRE</A></B> - 1975 and <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Barracuda">BARRACUDA</A></B> 
   - 1977). The film follows the exploits of sandals-wearing (with 
   socks!), goateed artist Bill (Kerwin), who has more issues than 
   National Geographic. The first time we see Bill, he and a female 
   cutie in a one-piece bathing suit are in a rowboat in a park and dock 
   at a rocky part of the lake. While the cutie poses on a boulder, Bill 
   whips out a piece of paper from his jacket pocket and begins 
   sketching her, but when she laughs at his commands of &quot;Don't 
   move! Don't move!&quot;, Bill picks up a handy speargun and shoots 
   her in the chest, killing her. Bill is nearly caught by a policeman 
   and a witness to the crime, who chase him through a park (filmed in 
   Montreal, Canada) during the opening credits, but he manages to avoid 
   them and make it back to his apartment, where he packs his belongings 
   and hightails it out of town on foot. We the switch to Bob (singer 
   Neil Sedaka, a good friend of William Kerwin's who also sang a song 
   [&quot;Do The Jellyfish&quot;] in <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#StingOfDeath1965">STING
    OF DEATH</A></B> a year later, a film Kerwin also worked on) and his 
   girlfriend Betty (Linda Christopher) frolicking in a pool at Betty's 
   rich Daddy's mansion, that is until Betty's cocktease older sister 
   Arlene (Jean Christopher, who is Linda's real-life sister) shows up 
   and asks Bob to rub some suntan lotion on her back. Bob happily 
   obliges, but it pisses-off Betty, who goes storming off with Bob 
   closely following behind her. Betty has a pool party that night with 
   all her college friends (a band called J.B. And The Playboys play 
   their hit song &quot;If You Don't Want To&quot;), where Bob, who is a 
   (what else?) rock-and-roll star, sings his latest hit 
   &quot;Waterbug&quot; (&quot;Get with it, don't quit it, 
   waterbug!&quot;) and everyone dances The Monkey around the pool. 
   Arlene crashes the party, does an impromptu striptease (since it's 
   1965, all the flesh we see is what's not covered by her black bikini) 
   and puts the moves on Bob. Later that night, Arlene sneaks into Bob's 
   bedroom and screws him. The next morning, Daddy drives Betty and Bob 
   back to college in his limousine (This is the last time we see Bob, 
   Betty or Daddy, as this entire long sequence seems to be inserted to 
   show what a slut Arlene is and to give Sedaka a chance to sing). When 
   Arlene has trouble closing the garage door, she asks a hitch-hiking 
   Bill (who just happens to be passing by) to help her and it leads to 
   her flirting with him and offering him $15 a day to help her close-up 
   the family mansion for the end of Summer. Bill accepts and soon 
   Arlene is pulling the old &quot;Oh, Bill, will you oil my back?&quot; 
   routine, but Bill couldn't be less interested. While Bill is cleaning 
   the house, he notices a huge walk-in freezer in the basement and he 
   starts getting ideas. Very bad ideas. It turns out Bill is not only 
   an artist, he's also a misogynist (There's some mother issues 
   mentioned throughout the film in Bill's dialogue, such as when he 
   tells Arlene that his mother taught him how scrub floors when he was 
   a child). After a childhood trauma, Bill is obsessed with an image in 
   his mind of two women in the water with a third woman firing a bow 
   and arrow at a shadowy figure. He has been trying to paint that image 
   since being released from a mental institution, but his female models 
   can't sit still (&quot;They... always... move!!!&quot;) and he goes 
   into a murderous rage. Now that he's got the walk-in freezer, he 
   figures he can kill his models and pose them in the freezer. This way 
   his models will never move. Bill begins by strangling Arlene while 
   she is taking a midnight stroll in a see-through nightie and posing 
   her dead body with a cocked bow and arrow in the freezer. He then 
   gets the bright idea of advertising for potential victims in the 
   newspaper's Personals section and Pat (Mary Lou Collins) applies for 
   the job. Bill drugs her drink, strangles her and poses her as the 
   second woman in the freezer. His next victim is Nikki (Andree 
   Champagne, who sings a song in French), who he picks up in a jazz 
   club, drugs her drink, strangles her and poses her as the third woman 
   in his dreams. He is now able to paint his masterpiece, but a visit 
   from one of Arlene's bitchy friends and a power outage bite him in 
   the ass. The bodies in the freezer start to thaw and Arlene's corpse 
   releases the arrow into Bill's neck, proving he was the shadowy 
   figure in<A HREF="playgirl_killer_1965b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/playgirl killer ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="366" HEIGHT="140" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   the image in his mind. Karma, it's a bitch.&nbsp; Though slow-moving 
   and uneventful throughout most of its running time, <B><A HREF="playgirl_killer_1965b.htm">PLAYGIRL
    KILLER</A></B>, directed and written by Erick Santamaria (his only 
   screen credit), still oozes sleaze (most of the women here are either 
   sluts or are so naive, all it takes is a few choice words to get them 
   to take off their clothes), has a killer jazz score and is a good 
   time capsule of French Canadian Montreal in 1965. William Kerwin is 
   suitably creepy and wide-eyed as the crazy Bill and while the 
   bloodletting is kept to a minimum (the speargun murder is the 
   bloodiest bit in the film), the freezer sequences will stay in your 
   brain for a long time to come (it's what I remembered most since 
   watching this on TV as a kid in the late-60's and early-70's). 
   Kerwin's oft-repeated line of &quot;Don't move!&quot; will have you 
   in stitches (it would make a good drinking game), as will the thought 
   of Neil Sedaka portraying a playboy (I always pictured him more 
   comfortable on Liberace's lap than in the arms of a woman, even if he 
   once was married to singer/songwriter Carole King). A good slice of 
   60's sleaze cheese. Also starring Ted Rust, Fred Smith, Serge 
   Lasalle, Jacqueline Douguet, Denise Andrieux and Eileen Woliner.

    Welcome to the Play Motel, where all of your sexual fantasies come 
   to life, but there is one huge caveat: Your fantasy could cost you 
   your life (or a huge sum of cash). Just like Hotel California: You 
   can check out any time you like, but you can never leave! A 
   businessman using the alias &quot;Four Leaf Clover&quot; (Enzo 
   Fisichella; <B><A HREF="teenage_prostitution_racket_1975_italy_ads.htm">TEENAGE
    PROSTITUTION RACKET</A></B> - 1975) checks in to the title 
   establishment looking for a good time. This motel has a bar where 
   prostitutes can wait for their johns. Four Leaf Clover is feeling 
   lucky and picks Loredana Salvi (Italian porn actress Marina Hedman, 
   using her pseudonym &quot;Marina Frajese&quot;; <B><A HREF="beast_in_space_1978.htm">BEAST
    IN SPACE</A></B> - 1978) as his lady for the evening. She takes him 
   into Room #3, which is covered in red. Red Walls, red carpet and a 
   red bed. It also has its own costume closet. Four Leaf Clover dresses 
   up as the Devil and Loredana dresses as a nun. He traces his trident 
   over her naked body and then they screw. Back in his office, his 
   secretary hands him an envelope. Inside it are compromising photos of 
   him with Loredana and a note saying if he doesn't pay 300 million 
   lire, the photos will be sent to the newspapers and his life will be 
   ruined. He calls his lawyer, Altieri (Bob Balisteri), but he gets the 
   answering machine. After telling Altieri the predicament he is in 
   (and we discover his name is Rinaldo Cortesi), we then see Altieri 
   naked in bed, with...Rinaldo's wife Luisa (Patrizia Behn; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Madness1980">MADNESS</A></B> 
   - 1980)! After listening to Rinaldo's message, Luisa says, &quot;That 
   husband of mine is always in trouble!&quot; Later that day, Altieri 
   calls Rinaldo back and suggests he goes to the police as soon as 
   possible, but Rinaldo says no, he would rather pay the money (Then 
   why in the hell did he call a lawyer???). Altieri then calls Luisa 
   and tells her what her husband is up to. That night, Luisa tip-toes 
   into her bedroom where Rinaldo is sleeping, silently opens a drawer 
   of his night table and steals a key, which opens his desk. She steals 
   the blackmail photos and takes them to police Inspector De Sanctis 
   (Anthony Steffen; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CrimesBlackCat">CRIMES OF 
   THE BLACK CAT</A></B> - 1972), who makes copies of the photos and 
   tells Luisa to put the originals back where she found them (Luisa 
   also tells the Inspector that she hasn't slept with her husband in 
   years and that she asked him for a divorce).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see the Inspector following Lorendana, who he discovers is a 
   porn actress. She is shooting a porn film in the Play Motel. Willy 
   (Mario Cutini; <B><A HREF="boys_of_violent_rome_1976.htm">THE BOYS OF 
   VIOLENT ROME</A></B> - 1976), a porn photographer, hits on Lorendana, 
   but she is repulsed by his advances and tells him to get lost. 
   Lorendana's boss, porn magazine publisher Max Liguori (Marino 
   Mas&eacute;; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Tenebre1982">TENEBRE</A></B> - 
   1982) sees Lorendana talking to the Inspector and wonders what she is 
   telling him. When Lorendana is driving home, she doesn't notice 
   someone in her back seat, who is wearing black gloves. When she does 
   see him, she says, &quot;What do you want?&quot; and then we see the 
   Inspector finding her dead body in her car, which is overturned in a 
   deserted location. We then see Luisa sneaking into the office of the 
   Play Motel's manager and watching some S &amp; M action in Room #3 
   through a two-way mirror. She doesn't notice the black-gloved killer 
   sneaking up behind her. He strangles her with a piece of rope and 
   carries her dead body through a secret passageway in the motel (all 
   we see of the killer are his gloves and extreme close-ups of his 
   eye). As a married couple, stage actor Roberto Vinci (Ray Lovelock; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#LastHouseBeach">LAST
    HOUSE ON THE BEACH</A></B> - 1978) and his wife Patrizia (Anna Maria 
   Rizzoli; <B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#BlazingFlowers1978">BLAZING
    FLOWERS</A></B> - 1978), are checking out of the motel (they go

   Novelli; <B><A HREF="syndicate_sadists_1975.htm">SYNDICATE SADISTS</A></B> 
   - 1975) presses a button, alerting the killer that he has a place to 
   stash Luisa's body. When Roberto and Patrizia are driving home, their 
   car gets a flat. Roberto opens the trunk to get the spare and 
   discovers Luisa's dead body. At the morgue, Rinaldo identifies his 
   wife's body and discovers that her valuable ring is missing. The 
   Inspector asks Roberto and Patrizia to go undercover for him to try 
   and get incriminating information on the Play Motel, since both dead 
   bodies are connected to it (The police would never ask normal 
   citizens to do what the Inspector asks!). The married couple agrees 
   and then we see a disguised Roberto (his disguise is a mustache!) 
   following Max to the Play Motel. Max goes to Room #3, dresses as a 
   priest and his &quot;date&quot;, Valeria Marzotti (Patrizia Webley; <B><A HREF="heroin_busters_1977.htm">THE
    HEROIN BUSTERS</A></B> - 1977), is dressed as a nun and tied to a 
   bed. Max is fully aware that he is being photographed (by Willy) 
   through the two-way mirror and puts on quite the show for the camera. 
   It turns out Max is the blackmailer and he uses photos of people who 
   refuse to pay him for publication in his porn magazine. Is Max also 
   the killer?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Patrizia goes undercover (in a wig!) at the Play Motel, playing a 
   wannabe porn starlet who wants naked photos of herself (You have to 
   be kidding me!). Willy starts taking full-frontal shots of Patrizia 
   and gets so turned on, he tries to rape her! Patrizia stops him, 
   takes a bathroom break (!) and sneaks into Willy's darkroom, where 
   she finds naked photos of Max and Valeria. She comes back and Willy 
   continues his porn shoot (!). Yes, Valeria is being blackmailed and 
   she doesn't know Max is involved. Max delivers Valeria's blackmail 
   payment to the killer, who hands Max the blackmail photos, which he 
   delivers to Valeria (Max has a sweet illicit business!). Max and his 
   accomplice(s) are raking in cash hand over fist, blackmailing wealthy 
   and famous citizens, like Guido Toselli (Vittorio Ripamonti), a 
   citizen in high standing (he's good friends with a <A HREF="play_motel_1979.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/play motel poster10 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>Cardinal

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But just who is the killer? It's not hard to figure out, as 
   director/screenwriter Mario Gariazzo gives us the most basic of plots 
   and the mystery element is non-existent. This is nothing but softcore 
   footage of people screwing interrupted occasionally by the killer 
   stalking and striking. According to Gariazzo (who passed away in 
   2002), notorious producer Armando Novelli (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SlaughterHotel1971">SLAUGHTER
    HOTEL</A></B> - 1971; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Manhunt1972">MANHUNT</A></B> 
   - 1972) pulled a fast one on him and the crew, inserting hardcore sex 
   footage into the film after it was finished (Novelli said that this 
   wasn't true, as Gariazzo was well aware what was to be done). The 
   actors, especially Ray Lovelock (who passed away late in 2017), were 
   horrified to learn that lookalikes were portraying them in a porn 
   film. They threatened legal action, but nothing became of it. It is 
   also obvious that the English dubbing artists were having a lot of 
   fun here, giving some characters exaggerated British accents and 
   spouting such laughable dialogue as, &quot;Talk you little bitch or 
   I'll turn your face into hamburger!&quot; What in the hell are 
   British accents doing in a film that is set in Rome?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When the non-porn edition was submitted for release in the United 
   States, it was slapped with an X Rating. The softcore footage comes 
   very close to porn, as Gariazzo lets the camera linger on women's 
   vaginas and, in one scene, you can see the labia! Needless to say, 
   this film was never released to theaters in the U.S. and never 
   released on VHS in the States. Raro Video offers the non-porn version 
   on DVD and Blu-Ray, with the hardcore inserts as an extra on the disc 
   (plenty of tongue-wagging and finger action). It is in widescreen 
   with the option of watching it in the original Italian language with 
   English subtitles or watching it English dubbed. Raro does their 
   usual fantastic job of presenting the film in its proper OAR and it 
   looks fantastic, much better than it deserves to. The only extras on 
   the disc are the aforementioned hardcore inserts and an 18-minute 
   documentary titled &quot;The Midias Touch&quot; where Lovelock and 
   Novelli discuss the making of this film (Lovelock says making this 
   film was the lowest point of his career), how it was released in the 
   two versions simultaneously (a common practice in Italy at the time) 
   and the furor it caused. It is informative and entertaining, more 
   than the film itself.&nbsp; This film is only for serious nudity 
   addicts or those looking for a cheap laugh. All others are warned to 
   stay away. The &quot;Play Motel&quot; theme song (by Ubaldo 
   Continiello) is a real earworm, though. Also starring Antonella

   a DVD on my home system as this print contains rollouts, distortion 
   and other video noise associated with an overused VHS tape. Here's 
   the story: Three too-stupid-for-words archaeology students (including 
   Indonesian action star Berry &quot;Barry&quot; Prima [<B><A HREF="hell_raiders_1985.htm">HELL
    RAIDERS</A></B> - 1985], in his first film role) hire some guides to 
   take them deep into the jungle where they hope to study a very 
   primitive tribe. After losing their boat and supplies to the raging 
   rapids (where one becomes <A HREF="primitif_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/primitiv poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>separated
    from the others), they must travel by foot, where they witness an 
   anaconda eating a large lizard (obvious stock footage) and find the 
   abandoned camp of Dr. Marcus, a scientist who disappeared in the area 
   a year earlier. Rita (Enny Haryono), the lone female of the group, is 
   nearly bitten by a cobra (a rubber snake on a string) and they then 
   are taken captive by a tribe of cannibals after their guide is killed 
   by a spiked boobytrap. Tied to poles, they are carried back to the 
   cannibal's camp, where they are tied to a rock and stripped nearly 
   naked. Robert (Prima) is forced to walk on all fours and act like a 
   dog while the children and women ride him. Robert is put in a bamboo 
   cage where the children pee on him and we witness a ritual where we 
   see the cannibals turn a giant snake into a maggot-ridden edible 
   paste. When one of the cannibals tries to rape Rita, the tribal 
   leader gives him a sharp rock castration. Meanwhile, Tommy (Johann 
   Mardjono), who was dislocated from the group during the boat 
   accident, treks through the jungle by himself. He sees an alligator 
   attacking and eating a leopard and eats poisonous fruit, causing him 
   to get sick and trip out. We also view the cannibals chowing down on 
   live lizards, slaughtering a live alligator and eating it's steaming 
   innards. Tommy witnesses a cannibal woman giving birth (she bites off 
   the umbilical cord and eats the afterbirth!) and follows her back to 
   camp. After Robert professes his faith in &quot;Our Lord&quot;, he 
   and Rita watch as the cannibals bash in the head of a monkey and eat 
   it's brains. Tommy finally reunites with Robert and Rita, where they 
   escape into the jungle, the cannibals not far behind. After battling 
   some quicksand, the trio must battle the cannibals and one of them 
   will get a spear in the gut before the other two get away. What's the 
   point of all this, you may ask? It's the Indonesians way of competing 
   with the Italian cannibal films, which were becoming extremely 
   popular at the time. While it's no <B><A HREF="#Sacrifice!1972">MAN

   offers enough gross-out moments and lapses in logic (A boomerang axe? 
   It must be seen to be believed!) to satisfy fans of cannibal cinema 
   and real life animal slaughter (which I find troubling). In other 
   words, it's insanely gory and utterly shameless. Not to mention 
   unintentionally hilarious. Tommy's hallucinations and Robert's sudden 
   knowledge of martial arts in the finale are two standouts. Put your 
   mind in neutral and enjoy the ride. The use of &quot;We Are The

    but nothing comes close to this piece of shit parading as a film. 
   Shot silent in 8mm with voiceover narration (a good clue that nothing 
   good is about to be seen), this film makes anything made by Ray 
   Dennis Steckler look like Orson Welles in comparison. A young ( and 
   terribly ugly) girl performs a supernatural sexual ritual and 
   conjures up her ancient witch ancestor who initiates her virginal 
   body to various sexual encounters (including making love to a gay 
   man!). The whole film (?) is a mixture of LSD trip visuals and home 
   movie footage trumped-up as filmed in &quot;trans-etheric vision and 
   telepathic dialogue&quot;. I guess if they told the truth and said it 
   was filmed in &quot;silent Kodak 8mm and dubbed later&quot; it 
   wouldn&#146;t have sold at all. Nothing in this film is in the least 
   bit watchable and, to add insult to injury, the words 
   &quot;pussy&quot; and &quot;fuck&quot; are, for some unfathomable 
   reason, bleeped out every time they are spoken. Weird for an R-rated 
   flick. Thankfully, director Victor Luminera has never made another 
   movie (his wind-up camera probably broke). Some films should just 
   stay lost. The theme song&#146;s lyrics go &quot;She came from the 
   belly of the Devil&#146;s bitch, beware of the 4-D witch.&quot; You 
   should just beware of this film. It can cause diaharrea, vaginal 
   cramps and brain cancer. Starring Margo, Esoterica and Tom Yerian. 
   They are probably working today as cashiers at the local Home Depot.

   metal pretzel) falling in the woods next to a small town. Four 
   scantily-clad female aliens show up at the home of schoolgirl Karla 
   (Lisa Schwedop) and her disc jockey brother John (Peter Guss), where 
   they ask Karla for tips on the opposite sex. Since Karla is still a 
   virgin, she doesn't have much advice to offer them. The next day, the 
   four vixens start attending school (at the appropriately-named Bliss 
   Hall, which is a real Seattle school campus) and begin screwing 
   around with the male student body. Within a week, the vixens have 
   done it with nearly all the popular guys and that doesn't sit too 
   well with the school's female population. Karla and her new boyfriend 
   Paul (Howard Scott), along with conniving schoolgirl Stephanie (Amy 
   Crumpacker), who has the hots for Paul's teacher father, Jack Morelli 
   (Julian Schembri), try to find out just why the vixens are here. When 
   Jack gets suspended from his job for screwing one of the vixens, he 
   tells Paul that the vixens are from the same planet as his mother, 
   who visited here sixteen years earlier, got pregnant with Paul and 
   then went back to her home planet after having the baby. He also 
   tells Paul that when they get angry or frustrated, the vixens are 
   extremely dangerous. Jack also believes that Paul's mother, Mary Jo 
   (Anne Lilly) has return to Earth and he is right. When Paul finds out 
   he is half-alien, he also discovers he has special powers (he removes 
   Karla's blouse by just thinking about it!). The vixens become 
   frustrated with the sexual performance of the males in town 
   (&quot;They are all virgins!&quot;) and begin zapping everyone with 
   rayguns, turning them into giant vegetables! Paul and Karla go to 
   Mary Jo and ask for her help in ending the madness, but she refuses. 
   The Pentagon is called and they send troops to blow up the vixens 
   (stock war footage and model planes on visible strings). Jack is able 
   to change Mary Jo's mind and she gives Paul a medallion that channels 
   his powers. I guess it all ends happily, as we next see Paul in 
   photos on &quot;Intergalatic&quot; postcards, smiling and posing with 
   vixens on their home planet. What?&nbsp; The premise for this film is 
   quite unique, even if the execution leaves a lot to be desired. As 
   Mary Jo explains to Jack, the reason why their all-female race came 
   to Earth sixteen years earlier was because they picked up a TV signal 
   of Elvis Presley's original censored performance on the Ed Sullivan 
   Show! She says, &quot;You got the top half and we got the bottom 
   half.&quot; The reason behind their return visit to Earth is because 
   one of their young females got hold of a copy of a &quot;teen 
   magazine&quot; and got curious! Mary Jo came along as a chaperone 
   this time, but <A HREF="revenge_of_the_teenage_vixens_from_outer_space_1985b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/revenge of the teenage vixens from outer space vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="232" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>tells
    Jack that &quot;they'll have to learn from their own mistakes.&quot; 
   Although most of the humor is juvenile, I must admit that I laughed 
   out loud when the vixens turned a bunch of students into giant 
   vegetables (the huge carrot with eyes is a comic standout). The 
   special effects are strictly lower-tier (lots of billowing fog and 
   foam rubber), but they fit in well with the overall tone of the 
   production. One-time director Jeff Ferrell, who also co-wrote and 
   co-produced this with his wife, Michelle Lichter, offers the viewer 
   zero nudity, which is strange considering the subject matter. The 
   closest this comes to naked skin is when Paul telekinetically removes 
   Karla's blouse and we then see Karla covering her breasts with her 
   hands. There is a lot of funny dialogue, such as when the dastardly 
   Danny (Sterling Ramberg) is zapped by the vixens and his mother comes 
   out of the house with him in a jar to show the other concerned 
   citizens. Danny's father turns to the crowd and says, &quot;There, 
   that's what's left of my son Danny. Just a giant pickle!&quot; A guy 
   in the crowd then says, &quot;They did this to my sister?&quot; 
   Stephanie replies, &quot;Worse. She was stepped-on afterwards!&quot; 
   We also hear a radio announcer say, &quot;We just received word that 
   the entire town of Springfield has been turned into a giant summer 
   squash!&quot; We then see a giant summer squash with eyes! It's no <B><A HREF="airplane_1980.htm">AIRPLANE</A></B>

   While this may be a terrible film, it's historical value is 
   immeasurable because it shows Times Square just before it was 
   cleaned-up and Disneyfied. You can almost taste and touch the filth 
   and desperation. God, I miss those days! Glenn Barnes (John Patrick

   manslaughter rap, where he accidentally killed a drug dealer in the

   prison); and crooked businessman Leonard Farrell (Michael Speero), 
   who runs a competing stripper/hooker bar and has a long-standing 
   rivalry with Glenn. When some of Farrell's stripper/whores want to

    orders his men to kill everyone that works for Glenn. What they 
   don't count on is that Glenn and his men, including Rip (Rick 
   Gianisi), are fighters and they beat-up and shoot Farrell's men (When 
   one of Farrell's men gets shot in the arm, he pulls out the bullet 
   with his teeth!). Glenn's grand re-opening is a big success (It's 
   like a burlesk show, with a rock band, a black female crooner, 
   strippers and a bad comedian named &quot;Zerocks&quot;, who's 
   &quot;A&quot; material consists of jokes like, &quot;I'm not black. 
   It's the sun lamp I bought in Woolworths!&quot; and the audience 
   roars with laughter!) and Farrell puts in an appearance to make some 
   veiled threats, has someone deliver a human head to Glenn in a box 
   (!) and later has his men burst into the Glenn's crowded business and 
   slaughter nearly all the patrons (including Glenn's father) with 
   machine gun fire (in the film's most effective scene). Glenn and his 
   men join forces with Tom and his gang (even cop Michelle looks the 
   other way) and they all look to get some NYC payback. When Farrell 
   kidnaps Michelle, Glenn must fight his way to her floor-by-floor 
   while Farrell watches all the action on close circuit TV. Believe it 
   or not, there actually is a riot on 42nd Street, as Farrell and his 
   men are graphically dispatched and the good guys take back the 
   streets.&nbsp; This is the rarest of director/scripter Tim Kincaid's 
   non-porn films (He still directs gay porn flicks using the name 
   &quot;Joe Gage&quot;). Best known in the 80's for directing a string 
   of lousy (yet, somehow, endearing) ultra-low-budget genre films, 
   including <B><A HREF="bad_girls_dormitory_1986.htm">BAD GIRLS DORMITORY</A></B>

   (1989). Kincaid made this one obviously without permits on location, 
   which may be why it is so hard to find in the U.S. (The print I 
   viewed came from a Japanese-subtitled laserdisc). It is atrociously 
   acted (as are all of Kincaid's films), but there are some surprising 
   bits of gore (effects courtesy of Ed French, who did the makeup 
   effects for most of Kincaid's genre films), including a throat 
   slashing that turns into a beheading (!), a boobytrapped tunnel where 
   one of Tom's gang is impaled through the head with a spring-loaded 
   spike, the bloody, squib-filled slaughter in Glenn's grindhouse and 
   the finale, where people get shot in the head and torso and Farrell 
   falls off of his building's roof and is bloodily impaled on a fence 
   below. The film's one true standout is Carl Fury as Farrell's 
   musclebound right-hand man Remy Wyler, the bullet-biting, almost 
   indestructable, never-say-die psychopath, who beheads people with a 
   knife (!), kidnaps children and has a long one-on-one fight with 
   Glenn in the finale (Yet his feelings still manage to get hurt when 
   Farrell yells racist remarks at him!). It's apparent that <A HREF="jeff_fahey_crappy_films.htm">Jeff

    VENGEANCE</A><A NAME="RollingVengeance"></A> (1987) -</B> I'm still 
   scratching my head over this one. This trucker action film was made 
   at least ten years too late. It was during the 70's when audiences 
   were most interested in trucker films, thanks to their fascination 
   with CB radios and it's culture, especially the shorthand language 
   that went with it (&quot;10-4, good buddy!&quot;). Thanks to this 
   obsession (which was thankfully short-lived in the mainstream), there 
   was a short spurt of trucker exploitation flicks during the 
   mid-to-late 70's, including <B><A HREF="#TruckStopWomen">TRUCK STOP WOMEN</A></B>

   early 80's (thanks, in part, to the inferior <B>BANDIT</B> sequels), 
   which makes me wonder why anyone would green-light a film like this. 
   The story is generic trucker stuff: A father-and-son trucker team, 
   Big Joe Russo (Lawrence Dane; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Rituals">RITUALS</A></B> 
   - 1977) and Joey Russo (Don Michael Paul; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Robot Wars">ROBOT

   and other pre-teen son are killed when a bunch of drunken jerks in a 
   pickup truck force their car on the opposite side of the road, 
   directly into the path of an oncoming 18 wheeler, killing them 
   instantly. The driver of the pickup truck, Victor Doyle (Todd 
   Duckworth), is brought <A HREF="rolling_vengeance_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rolling vengeance vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="146" HEIGHT="263" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>to
    trial, but the judge finds a lack of evidence for a manslaughter 
   conviction and fines Victor $300 instead, which pisses-off both Big 
   &amp; Little Joe. To add insult to injury, Victor's father Tiny Doyle 
   (Ned Beatty, sporting the most ridiculous-looking hairpiece I have 
   ever seen), who runs the town's only bar (and a used car lot, just to 
   show how crookedly evil he really is), fires the Russo's from 
   delivering the booze to his bar, which puts the hurt on the Russo's 
   trucking business. Besides Victor, Tiny has a bunch of other half-wit 
   sons by different mothers with names like Moon Man, Finger and Hair 
   Lip and just like any good inbred clan they do whatever Papa says. 
   That includes dropping cinderblocks from an overpass directly into 
   the path of Big Joe's rig, forcing him to jackknife and crash, 
   putting him into a coma. Little Joe says enough is enough and, in 
   true 80's montage fashion, builds a monster truck (it spits flames 
   out of it's exhaust pipes) and uses it to trash Tiny's used car 
   business as well as Tiny's tricked-out Cadillac. The police, led by 
   Lieutenant Sly Sullivan (Michael J. Reynolds), are baffled as to who 
   and what have caused all this destruction (Little Joe only brings out 
   his monster truck at night to avoid detection) and since Tiny is not 
   cooperating, there's very little the cops can do. Tiny orders his 
   mentally deficient sons to ambush Little Joe's trucker friend Steve 
   Tyler (Barclay Hope), but Little Joe and his truck of destruction 
   show up in the nick of time and save Steve's ass, killing two of 
   Tiny's sons (Little Joe has equipped the monster truck with a giant 
   drillbit in the front, which he uses to rip the door off the van that 
   Tiny's sons were in). The rest of Tiny's sons rape and brutalize 
   Little Joe's girlfriend, Misty (Lisa Howard; <B><A HREF="replikator_1994.htm">REPLIKATOR</A></B> 
   - 1994, also with Ned Beatty), so Little Joe chases them down, 
   flattening them under the truck's obscenely-oversized wheels. When 
   Big Joe succumbs from his injuries, Little Joe hops in his monster 
   truck and heads down to Tiny's bar, where Tiny and only surviving son 
   Victor are arguing about about Victor's yellow streak. Little Joe 
   flattens the bar, Tiny is shot between the eyes by Lt. Sullivan and 
   Victor steals the monster truck and chases Misty into a drainage 
   tunnel with the truck's drillbit (insert phallic symbolism here). 
   Little Joe saves Misty in the nick of time and, with all the bad guys 
   dead, Lt. Sullivan covers for Little Joe, letting him get away with 
   murder. Hooray for vigilantism!&nbsp; Directed without any flair by 
   Steven H. Stern, who is better known for directing TV movies like <B><A HREF="ghost_of_flight_401_1978.htm">THE
    GHOST OF FLIGHT 401</A></B> (1978) and <B><A HREF="park_is_mine_1985.htm">THE
    PARK IS MINE</A></B> (1985). That could be why this film has the 
   same flat look and feel of a TV movie. The violence and nudity are 
   also fairly restrained for a film with an R-rating. We never really 
   see the bloody aftermath of Little Joe's truck vengeance and Misty's 
   rape cuts away before the viewer sees anything. Which brings up my 
   whole point: Why make a trucker revenge film ten years too late and 
   then forget to add violence or nudity? It just doesn't make any 
   sense. This has to be the worst film Ned Beatty has done (he's 
   absolutely awful here) and the acting talent by the rest of the cast 
   never rises above a TV Movie Of The Week. I can't find one thing to 
   recommend here. There's more action at a monster truck rally. Avoid 
   it like a case of herpes. Also starring Michael Dyson, Hugo Dann, 
   Michael Kirby and Alar Aedma. Originally released on VHS by <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Embassy">Charter

    The film opens with professional photographer John Bradley (Ivan 
   Rassimov; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Spasmo">SPASMO</A></B> - 1974) on 
   assignment in Thailand and we watch as he takes photos of the 
   country's colorful beauty and people. The film then displays the 
   following scrawl: <B>&quot;In the dense jungle along the often ill 
   defined border between Thailand and Burma, it is still possible to 
   find primitive tribes which have no contact with the outside world. 
   This story was filmed on location with one of these tribes and even 
   though some of the rites and ceremonies shown are perhaps gruesome, 
   they are portrayed as they are actually carried out. Only the story 
   is imaginary.&quot;</B> We then see John take in a Thai kickboxing 
   match where his girlfriend is so disgusted by what she sees, she 
   leaves. After the match, John decides to get a drink at a local bar 
   (look for prolific Italian producer Luciano Martino [<B><A HREF="screamers_1980_blu-ray.htm">SCREAMERS</A></B> 
   - 1979] as an uncredited extra), where some local takes exception to 
   a white man drinking at his bar and he pulls out a switchblade. John 
   takes the knife away and accidentally stabs the man in the stomach. 
   John flees (What chance does a white man have with the local police?) 
   and takes a trip down a river with his guide (he pays a local to tell 
   no one where he has gone if they ask). One morning, John wakes up and 
   discovers that his guide is dead on the bank of the river, his throat 
   has been cut. He jumps in the river to retrieve the body and is 
   captured by a tribe of people who have never seen a white man before. 
   They start banging on a drum to communicate to their village and one 
   tribesman goes to their leader, Lahuna (Ong Ard), and announces that 
   they have caught a giant &quot;fishman&quot; (they have no idea what 
   scuba gear is for). John is brought to the village, where he hangs in 
   a net connected to a tree branch. John watches as second-in-command 
   Tuan (Tuan Tevan) cuts out the tongues out of two tribesmen, members 
   of the &quot;Kuru&quot; cannibal tribe, for eating human flesh (Tuan 
   says, &quot;Let this be a lesson to all other cannibal tribes!&quot;).
    John is shocked by what he sees and calls this non-cannibal tribe 
   &quot;savages' (an alternate title for this film is <B><A HREF="man_from_deep_river_1972.htm#DeepWaterSavages">DEEP
    WATER SAVAGES</A></B>).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Lahuna believes that John may be dangerous, but his beautiful 
   daughter Maraya (Me Me Lai; <B><A HREF="jungle_holocaust_1976.htm">JUNGLE
    HOLOCAUST</A></B> - 1976; also starring Ivan Rassimov) pleads to her 
   father to make him her slave (&quot;He is not a fishman. He is only a 
   man.&quot;). Tuan and some other male tribe members throw the 
   &quot;fishman&quot; in the river and taunt him by throwing dead fish 
   at him. Lahuna shows up and declares that John belongs to him. This 
   pleases Maraya, but bothers male tribe member Karen (Sulallewan 
   Suxantat). The next scene depicts Karen milking a cobra for its venom 
   (but it will not be used on John). John is tied-up and only set free 
   to do menial work around the village (Maraya orders Tuan to strip 
   John naked and to put him to work in the river (trying to spear fish 
   for dinner). John doesn't speak their language (At one point he yells 
   out, &quot;I'm a man, not a fish!), but an old woman named Taima 
   (Prasitsak Singhara) speaks English, explaining to John that she was 
   kidnapped by the tribe years before when she was walking in the 
   jungle. Taima agrees to help John escape.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When a tribesman is accidentally killed by a falling heavy idol, 
   John watches a ritual where his body is burned and his wife is 
   screwed by another tribesman, who claims her as his own (I guess 
   women are left no time to grieve!). Taima believes this is the 
   perfect time for John to escape, so he does, only to get caught by 
   Karen, who challenges John to a fight to the death. John wins, 
   stabbing Karen to death in the stomach with a spear (I guess this is 
   John's preferred method of killing a man) and when the other tribe 
   members want to kill John, Karen says with his dying breath, &quot;No,
    he has won!&quot; John sees a helicopter approaching and passes out 
   when running towards it. When John wakes up, he finds that he has not 
   been rescued. He is still a prisoner with the tribe. He is put on a 
   spinning device in a hut, where his head is made immobile with a 
   bamboo cage (this image is used in many of the posters for this 
   film). As he spins slowly around the tribesmen use blowguns to shoot 
   darts into John's torso. He is then left out in the blazing sun tied 
   to a bamboo rack until Lahuna decides John has learned his lesson.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    John is now free to roam the village, where he watches Lahuna cut 
   off the top of a monkey's head and feast on its brains (Is it real? 
   It looked real to me. This was copied in the fake mondo film <B><A HREF="faces_of_death_1978.htm">FACES
    OF DEATH</A></B> - 1978.). John earns Lahuna's trust when he saves 
   the life of a young choking boy by cutting his throat open and 
   performing an emergency tracheotomy. Lahuna is so impressed that he 
   makes John one of three me who are qualified to become Maraya's 
   groom. Maraya is blindfolded and restrained naked while each of the 
   three men take turns sticking their arm in a hole in a hut and 
   feeling her up. She decides who is to become her groom by who made 
   her feel the most like a woman! Of course, she picks John, they screw 
   like rabbits and they fall in love. A few weeks later, Lahuna calls 
   for John to come to his hut, where he announces that Maraya is 
   pregnant. A happy John runs to Maraya and says, &quot;It'll be a boy. 
   My little black savage!&quot; (!!!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Six months pass and John has taught Maraya English (he now 
   understands their language). The village is attacked by members of 
   the Kuru cannibal tribe. John witnesses one of them eating the flesh 
   of a member of his adoptive tribe and he cuts out the cannibal's 
   tongue (something he strongly protested when he was captured). Maraya 
   is having serious medical issues with her pregnancy, so John decides 
   that the only way to save his wife and child is to escape to 
   civilization. Once again, he asks for Taima's help to escape, only 
   when he does, the tribe is not so forgiving this time as we watch 
   Tuan cut off Taima's hand on orders by Lahuna. They recapture John 
   and Maraya, but don't punish either of them. Maraya is confined to 
   her hut due to her medical condition (she goes blind). The entire 
   Kuru cannibal tribe attack the village, burning down huts and killing 
   Tuan, forcing John, Maraya, Lahuna and what's left of the tribe to 
   flee into the jungle. Maraya dies giving birth to a healthy baby boy 
   (she can't even see him). A helicopter appears overhead, but instead 
   of running towards it, John runs away from it and tells the tribe to 
   hide. John's life now is as a tribesman, as he tells everyone that 
   they must rebuild the village.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Originally released on fullscreen VHS by Prism Entertainment (it was 
   slightly edited) in the mid-'80s, with a widescreen uncut DVD from 
   Shriek Show that followed in 2004 (both using the title <B>THE MAN 
   FROM DEEP RIVER</B>). The Blu-Ray, from <A HREF="http://www.rarovideousa.com">Raro
    Video</A>, is the preferred way to watch this, if only for the 
   25-minute documentary &quot;Cannibal World&quot;, where the late 
   Umberto Lenzi talks about his career (he believes that <B><A HREF="action.htm#Almost Human">ALMOST

   [1969] is better than <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Spasmo">SPASMO</A></B> 
   [1974; once again. I agree]). Also in the documentary is an interview 
   with screenwriter Francesco Barilli (who co-wrote this film with 
   Massimo D'Avack. They both wrote the screenply to the terrific giallo 
   film <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WhoSawHerDie">WHO SAW HER DIE?</A></B>

   western <B><A HREF="man_called_horse_1970.htm">A MAN CALLED HORSE</A></B> 
   (1970) and that he wanted nothing to do with Ovidio G. Assonitis (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Madhouse">MADHOUSE</A></B>

   this documentary is the interview with Me Me Lai, who talks about her 
   career and offers no apologies about her many roles where she 
   appeared completely nude (including this film). It's refreshing to 
   hear a beautiful woman (she still looks great) have no regrets about 
   her career. As a matter of fact, Ms. Lai seems to enjoy all the 
   attention she has received and has nothing but good things to say 
   about Lenzi. Sometimes the extras are more informative than the film 
   itself, which is the case here. That's not to say that this is a 
   badly-made or boring film. It's not. Be aware that if you have an

    nursing a sore ass. Dissention erupts in the group over Bobby 
   (&quot;He&#146;s queer. Satan doesn&#146;t want victims&quot;) and 
   Sherry hangs three of the disciples for wanting Bobby ousted from the 
   compound. The dashing, debonnaire Simon (Robert C. Ray II in an 
   excellent performance) returns and, finding out what Sherry has done, 
   buries her up to her neck and pours maple syrup over her head. While 
   waiting for the ants to come, Simon gives Bobby two choices: He can 
   stay in bed and watch the ants devour Sherry or he can get out of bed 
   and quit being a victim. Bobby opts for the latter. He escapes from 
   the compound and returns home (after electrocuting two compound 
   guards and drowning two more guards in quicksand). He hits his father 
   over the head with a bottle, ties up his stepsister (rape is implied) 
   and throws her in the backseat of his car. He then drives to the 
   house of the four men who raped him and kills them with a shotgun. He 
   cuts off the head of the lead rapist, puts it in a plastic bag (he 
   may have done the same thing to his father since there are two heads 
   in the bag) and delivers it, along with his stepsister, to Simon. The 
   final scene shows Bobby and Sherry making passionate love intercut 
   with scenes of his stepsister being crucified (with metal spikes!) on 
   a wooden cross. A true happy ending! This mind-blowing flick must be 
   seen to be disbelieved. The screenwriters (Gary Garrett and Ron 
   Levitt) are definitely pro-Satan and anti-homosexual. All gay 
   characters are portrayed as sexual deviates and meet nasty ends. When 
   a female disciple swears before Simon and Satan that she is not a 
   lesbian (she is), a river of blood flows from her mouth and she 
   chokes to death! This demented film, directed and produced by Joe 
   Wiezycki (has he done anything else?) is so steeped in homosexual 
   undertones (Bobby is either naked or in his underwear for most of the

   Pictures. The film opens with a woman in some island prison buried up 
   to her shoulders in sand while a snake coils around her neck, 
   squeezing the life from her. We then switch to the newly-shot 
   footage, where Daly (Blair) steps out of a limousine, walks into a 
   highrise building, shoots the security guard (Jillette) at the front 
   desk right between the eyes when he asks her to sign-in (how rude!) 
   and then takes the elevator to the office of Mr. Luker (Askin). While 
   Daly holds Mr. Luker hostage with a machinegun, she relates a story 
   to him about his dirty jewel busin<A HREF="savage_island_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/savage island force video vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ess
    and how he and his associates use women prisoners as cheap labor to 
   mine his precious jewels on Emerald Island. Suddenly, we are back to 
   the old footage, as Daly narrates the story of how a handful of 
   female prisoners put up with abuse from horny guards and a sadistic 
   warden at a work camp. A couple of new female prisoners are actually 
   working in conjunction with Daly (though we hear her voice, Blair 
   does not appear, even as inserts, in the old footage) to bring down 
   the camp and, with the help of Laredo (Anthony Steffan), the island's 
   only good guy, bring all the female prisoners together for a revolt, 
   but not before plenty of naked showers, lesbian and straight 
   encounters and some good, old fashioned torture, including rape and 
   whippings. After the women escape with Laredo's help, they are hunted 
   down in the jungle by the remaining guards. After surviving an attack 
   by leeches (well, one doesn't survive) and a pool of quicksand (oops, 
   another one bites the dust), the remaining women (both of them) take 
   an injured Laredo to safety and we then return back to Daly in Mr. 
   Luger's office. After killing Luger's bodyguard, Daly shoots Luger 
   and robs his safe of all his jewels. There, I've just saved you 77 
   minutes of your life. Use them for something more productive, like 
   getting painful laser treatments to remove that Yogi Bear tattoo you 
   had put on your left asscheek during that one drunk night no one ever 
   talks about.&nbsp; This is a real ordeal to sit through, thanks to 
   the lousy dubbing and a plot that makes absolutely no sense. This is 
   nothing but a &quot;best of&quot; collection of scenes from the two 
   earlier films, which shared many of the same actors (Steffan, Ajita 
   Wilson and Cristina Lai), whose hairstyles and clothing change from 
   scene-to-scene. While there is plenty of full-frontal female nudity 
   on view, the hackneyed rewritten plot and slapdash editing offer 
   little entertainment value for your hard-earned cash. The ridiculous 
   dubbing consists of people yelling profanities at the women 
   prisoners, such as this exchange: <B><I>Female Guard</I></B>: 
   &quot;Get back to work, you filthy cunts! Didn't you hear me?&quot; <B><I>Female
    Prisoner</I></B>: &quot;We didn't hear you!&quot; There is a 
   smattering of violence here and there, including Ajita Wilson (a 
   hermaphrodite in real life) biting the head off a snake, none of it 
   is very convincing or exciting. Shame on Linda Blair for 
   participating in deceitful crap like this. While we expect false 
   advertising and sleight-of-hand from Charles Band (who is still

   1971) stars as Jo Turner, an American revolutionary working in the 
   Philippines with boyfriend Ernesto (Dindo Fernando) to overthrow a 
   facist regime helped along by the sadistic Capt. Morales (Eddie 
   Garcia). Jo is captured by Capt. Morales and is sent to prison while 
   boyfriend Ernesto is doublecrossed and murdered by bandito Malavasi 
   (a long-haired Sid Haig in a sombrero) and his sidekick One-Eye 
   (Filippino staple Vic Diaz). With no help for outside help to escape, 
   Jo and her friend Mai Ling (Rosanna Ortiz) must find their own way to 
   break out, but they are dogged repeatedly by female interrogator Lynn 
   Jackson (Gloria Hendry), who nearly rapes Jo with a razor-sharp dildo 
   attached to a power drill. When Jackson shows her Ernesto's 
   bullet-ridden corpse, Jo swears vengeance on Malavasi and works with 
   Mai Ling to find a way out of prison. Malavasi, meanwhile, ambushes a 
   government convoy and steals one million dollars of General 
   Balthasar's (Leoplodo Salcedo) illegal kickbacks and tries to find a 
   way off the island. The General orders Capt. Morales to find Malavasi 
   and return the money and opportunist W.P. Billingsley (John Ashley) 
   works out a deal with Jackson to break Jo and Mai Ling out of prison 
   so they will lead them to the money. The three girls escape, ditch 
   Billingsley and go searching for Malavasi and the money, but the 
   bumbling Capt. Morales and his troops are not far behind. All three 
   factors meet at a dock where Malavasi tries to escape by boat (helped 
   by a guy in a wheelchair called &quot;Peg Leg&quot;). He fails, but 
   gets away, Morales gets run over by a jeep and the three women 
   finally catch up with Malavasi at a beach, where they bury Malavasi 
   and One-Eye up to their necks and wait for the tide to come in. All 
   three women (and in some aspects, Billingsley) get what they came for 
   in the finale.&nbsp; Eddie Romero sprinkles many comedic moments in 
   this film, which at first plays rather uneasily (considering the 
   amount of bloody violence), but, as the film<A HREF="savage_sisters_1974b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/savage sisters ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="122" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   moves along, becomes extremely funny. When Capt. Morales captures Jo 
   and Mai Ling, he kills all their female comrades by firing squad for 
   refusing to tell him the whereabouts of Ernesto, but spares Jo and 
   Mai Ling's lives by saying, &quot;There's more than one way to skin a 
   pussy!&quot; and then sending them to prison. We then see Morales' 
   true colors at the prison, where he and prison matron Ortega (Rita 
   Gomez) play S&amp;M games and she calls Morales a &quot;dog&quot; and 
   makes him lick her. There's also a funny scene after the prison 
   breakout where Jo, Jackson and Mai Ling separately seduce Billingsley 
   all in the same night to find out the location of Malavasi and the 
   money (he tells all three of them, &quot;It's just the three of us: 
   You, me and the money!) and they tie him up the next morning and take 
   off without him. Billingsley then joins forces with Capt. Morales (I 
   told you he was an opportunist). Billingsley also tries to flimflam 
   Malavasi (Sig Haig is hilarious throughout the whole film) by getting 
   him out of the country on a plane that literally falls apart on the 
   runway. The funniest running gag is Capt. Morales and his constant 
   need to get everything he does down on film. He has his lieutenant 
   take photos of him standing next to dead bodies, meeting the general, 
   getting beat up in a bar fight and even his own death. As he lies 
   dying on the pavement after the three girls have just run over him 
   with a jeep, he orders his lieutenant to take photos of him with his 
   final breath, by saying, &quot;The camera, quickly, while we still 
   have light!&quot; It's apparent John Ashley (who loved the 
   Philippines) was also having a great time. He gets to make out with 
   all three ladies, participate in some gunfights and even talks 
   directly to the audience in the beginning of the film, where he sets 
   up the plot of the film while surrounded by beautiful women. Not 
   surprising, since he also co-produced this with Romero. Quite bloody 
   in spots (there's a castration scene that's both funny and severe) 
   and entertaining as all hell. Seek this out. Also starring Angelo 
   Ventura, Alfonso Carvajal, Subas Herrero and Johnny Long. As I have

    them all and found innocent by a jury when brought to trial. When 
   her law class discovers Jennifer's history, she and girlfriend Sam 
   (Linda Lyer) go away for a weekend to a cabin in the woods. When Sam 
   goes for a walk, she gets lost and ends up at the house of Dwayne 
   (Phil Newman, who looks like a deranged Conway Twitty), who proceeds 
   to rape her and then passes her to crazy friend Tommy (director 
   Donald Farmer), who we earlier see stab&nbsp; a girl in a bar. Tommy 
   knifes Sam in the vagina after she knees him in the nuts, killing 
   her. With Sam now dead, Dwayne and Tommy lure Jennifer over to 
   Dwayne's house, where they make her taste &quot;pork belly pie&quot; 
   (which contains the flesh of Sam) and then chase her through the 
   woods, where they rape her (again without taking off their pants). 
   Tommy cuts her across the chest with his knife and they leave her for 
   dead. Jennifer comes to later on (and her knife wound is gone!) and 
   flags down a passing car. Jennifer gets her revenge by using a 
   chainsaw to cut Dwayne's head in two and blows Tommy's balls off with 
   a sawed-off shotgun.&nbsp; This stupid, juvenile and cheap (not to 
   mention short at 65 minutes) SOV flick looks like it was thrown 
   together in two days. The obnoxious and irritating music score drones 
   so loud that it drowns out most of the badly-recorded dialogue.&nbsp; 
   The special effects are anything but special (the 
   chainsaw-to-the-head bit will make you howl at its cheesiness). For a 
   rape/revenge film, there's surprisingly very little nudity, just 
   flashes of breasts here and there. The rapes are very sterile, as 
   everyone leaves their clothes on and just dry-humps, so the sickos 
   out there expecting something graphic will be bitterly disappointed.

   (1987) -</B> Here's something you don't see on my site often (or at 
   all): A gore Western. No, not a horror film set in a Western setting 
   (I've reviewed plenty of them), but an honest-to-goodness Western 
   with plenty of gore. During the Civil War, a squad of psychotic 
   Southern soldiers murder Indian chief Black Eagle and most of his 
   tribe (they shoot them in the head, stab them in the backs with 
   swords and even decapitate them) and then kidnap the Chief's 
   beautiful daughter, Yarin (Mapy Galan; <B><A HREF="city_of_lost_children_1995.htm">CITY

    to kill him because he is a white man. We find out Matt's wife was 
   raped and killed by Indians, yet he still protects Yarin from Gordon 
   (he shoots and kills Hondo for being nosey) and his men. Matt was 
   once Gordon's lieutenant, but he quit because he got tired of all the 
   needless killing. Yarin and Matt begin to depend on each other and 
   they'll need the comraderie as Gordon and his squad surround Matt's 
   ranch. Matt and Yarin sneak out of the ranch and escape (Yarin scalps 
   one of Gordon's men and slits the throat of another when they make 
   their retreat), with Gordon and his men not far behind. Yarin 
   catches-up with the remaining survivors of her tribe and Matt must 
   fight a young buck to prove his worth. Matt does just that and he and 
   the tribe manage to thin Gordon's squad one man at a time, but Matt 
   is shot and seriously wounded, which slows their progress. They avoid 
   detection, which again pisses-off Gordon (he whips one of his own men 
   in anger). Matt makes a miraculous recovery (thanks to Yarin's Indian 
   medicine), but gets captured by Gordon and tortured by having two 
   hooks attached to his chest while Gordon's men tug at them with 
   ropes. Yarin goes on the warpath, scalping, skewering and blowing-up 
   Gordon's men, until only Gordon is left. We then learn the real truth 
   of how Matt's wife died and justice is done, leaving Yarin and Matt 
   to live a long and happy life.&nbsp; Directed by late Italian 
   sleasemeister Bruno Mattei (Using the pseudonym &quot;Werner 
   Knox&quot;, which website IMDB misidentifies as Claudio Fragasso [<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Monster Dog">MONSTER
    DOG</A></B> - 1985], who was Assistant Director on this film using 
   his normal pseudonym &quot;Clyde Anderson&quot; Why would someone be 
   the director and the assistant director on the same film? It makes no 
   sense.), <B><A HREF="scalps_1987b.htm">SCALPS</A></B> is bound to 
   upset anyone who whistles &quot;Dixie&quot; on a regular basis. 
   Southerners are portrayed as murderous, women-raping perverts who 
   think nothing of killing innocent Indian women and children and 
   proudly hang their severed heads on their horses.&nbsp; Since this is 
   an Italian film, it's an equal-opportunity offender, as most of the 
   Indians (actually Italians wearing greasepaint) are seen either 
   holding scalps or scalping every white man they encounter, whether 
   they are a threat or not. There's not much meat to the plot, which 
   was written by Mattei and Robert Di Girolamo (with a co-story credit 
   going to actor Richard Harrison [<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Blood Debts">BLOOD
    DEBTS</A></B> - 1983], who doesn't appear in this film). It's just 
   basically a long chase film, but the final 30 minutes is a non-stop 
   gorefest. Gordon performs a nasty scalping on a helpless Indian; 
   Yarin shoots people through the neck and other body parts with her 
   bow (she even blows one guy apart with an arrow/dynamite combo); 
   Gordon shoots his own wife in the head for betraying him and Matt 
   gets his ultimate payback by scalping Gordon, when he learns that 
   Gordon, who was Matt's wife's father, killed his own daughter when he 
   tried to rape her, then blamed her death on the Indians. The hardest 
   scene to watch is when Matt has two hooks (which look like eagle 
   claws) pierce his chest and Gordon's guys pull on them in opposite 
   directions, kind of what happened to Richard Harris in <B><A HREF="man_called_horse_1970.htm">A
    MAN CALLED HORSE</A></B> (1970). The easiest parts to watch in this 
   film are the plentiful nude scenes of the beautiful Mapy Galan. Bruno 
   Mattei, better known for his crazy horror and action films like <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Rats">RATS:
    NIGHT OF TERROR</A></B> (1983) and <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Robowar">ROBOWAR</A></B>

   thing, if you know what I mean.), as he was the only living director

   Simon Sinestrari (Andrew Prine) is a homeless warlock (he lives in a 
   storm drain) who gets picked up by the cops on a vagrancy charge. 
   While in jail, he meets Turk (George Paulsin), who later introduces

    (Gerald York), a rich socialite who gives Simon money to make 
   talismans. Simon becomes a society darling, performing magic tricks 
   and reading tarot cards for the elite. Linda (Brenda Scott, Prine's 
   real-life wife at the time), the District Attorney's daughter, falls 
   hard for Simon and it seems he and Linda were lovers in a previous 
   life (at least that's what Simon tells her). When snooty socialite 
   Colin (Angus Duncan, the evil Dr. John in <B><A HREF="#SweetSugar">SWEET
    SUGAR</A></B> [1972]) pays Simon with a bad check for a tarot 
   reading, Simon makes a wager with Hercules that he can kill Colin 
   within two days by using &quot;witchcraft only&quot;. Simon takes 
   Turk under his wing as his apprentiss and they both view a glowing 
   red orb floating in Simon's underground lair, but Simon chases it 
   away with his &quot;powers&quot;. Simon makes a crude wooden cross 
   and attaches the bad check (along with a live chicken) to it and we 
   next see the red orb appear outside Colin's house, where a huge 
   flower pot falls on Colin's head, killing him. With the money he wins 
   from the wager with Hercules, Simon moves out of the storm drain into 
   a large basement apartment (When Simon draws a pentagram on the 
   basement wall, the landlord thinks he is Jewish!). Simon has sex with 
   Linda after performing a spell over her (they are both naked and 
   Simon keeps repeating, &quot;Electric, charge! Magnetic, 
   charge!&quot;) and Hercules is visited by the red orb, scaring him 
   into making Simon remove the (imaginary?) curse. Simon and Turk then 
   make a visit to a fake suburban witch's coven (run by Andy Warhol 
   regular Ultra Violet), where Simon makes everyone look like a fool. 
   The police raid Simon's basement apartment, thanks to Linda's father 
   (Norman Burton), but all the cops find are some legal herbs and a 
   metal rod that contains a mysterious force (it could it just has a 
   strong magnetic force). Simon helps all the drug users get revenge on 
   narc John Peter (Richard Ford Grayling), stabbing him to death while 
   performing one of his rituals. It all bites Simon in the ass, though, 
   as the town's drug supply dries up and the addicts take it out on 
   Simon.&nbsp; This early 70's exploitationer was given an advertising 
   campaign to market it as a horror film, but that couldn't be farther 
   from the truth. This is really a <A HREF="simon_king_of_the_witches_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/simon king of the witches poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="131" HEIGHT="193" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>wicked
    little black comedy (Prine even talks directly to the viewer in the 
   very first scene) where we have to decide whether Simon is the real 
   thing or a tricky charlatan. The funniest scene come when Turk (who 
   had Simon perform a love spell for him, after Simon makes him 
   jerk-off in a cup) complains to Simon that he has an erection that 
   won't go away. Simon come up with a comical and novel way for Turk to 
   lose his hardon (it involves a hankerchief tied to his penis and a 
   knife). This is Andrew Prine's film all the way, as he injects a bit 
   of scoundrel, con man and rogue into his character. As the film 
   progresses, Simon's true colors come to light, but we are never sure 
   if he's a fake or the real magilla. Real or not, one gets the sense 
   that Simon believes in everything he is doing and Prine conveys a 
   sense of playful danger in every scene he is in. Director Bruce 
   Kessler (<B><A HREF="killers_three_1968.htm">KILLERS THREE</A></B> - 
   1968; <B><A HREF="death_moon_1978.htm">DEATH MOON</A></B> - 1978) 
   rightfully leaves the viewer to decide if a lot of what is happening 
   on-screen is real or just in Simon's fertile imagination (An in-joke 
   has Simon carrying a wooden crate marked &quot;Kessler Chemical&quot; 
   when he moves into the basement apartment). The screenplay, by Robert 
   Phippeny, loses it's way in the final third, when it turns into a 
   narcotics and police corruption drama and the focus is taken off 
   Simon. Still, it's a pretty entertaining blast from the past and a 
   rare chance to see Andrew Prine in a starring role. He was pretty 
   much in demand during the 70's, taking starring roles in <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Centerfold Girls">THE

   This sick, sadistic Danish production could never be made in 
   today&#146;s politically correct climate. It treats women like dirt, 
   contains brutal torture scenes and is definitely not for the faint of 
   heart. In other words, I loved it! Peter and Mary (Tony Eades &amp; 
   Anne Sparrow), a down on their luck couple, rent a cheap room on the 
   top floor of a converted nightclub run by the sadistic Lila Lash 
   (Clara Keller) and her deformed midget son Olaf (Torben, who is a 
   sight to behold). Lila and Olaf run a prostitution ring in the attic, 
   where kidnapped girls are kept in check with unhealthy doses of 
   heroin and nightly beatings. Mary notices a wide variety of faceless 
   men entering the attic at all hours of the <A HREF="sinful_dwarf_1972b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sinful dwarf.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="267" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>day
    and night and becomes suspicious. When she tells Tony what she has 
   seen, he tells her to mind her own business because he is more 
   worried about finding a job than losing the only place they can 
   afford to stay. Lila and Olaf set their sights on adding Mary to 
   their stable but first must figure out a way to get Tony out of the 
   picture. Lila sets Tony up with a job in a toy shop run by a fat slob 
   named Santa Claus, which is actually a front for a heroin smuggling 
   ring. Santa sends Tony (who is unaware of the illegal activities) to 
   France, giving Lila and Olaf the chance to kidnap Mary. They leave a 
   note in the room in which Mary tells Tony that she is leaving him. 
   Meanwhile, Mary is chained naked in the attic, shot full of heroin 
   and vaginally penetrated with the handle of Olaf&#146;s cane. She is 
   then raped by one of Lila&#146;s customers. Tony returns from France 
   and finds the note. Feeling dejected, he goes back to the toy shop to 
   work off his worries. While working in the basement, he overhears 
   Santa and Olaf talking about the heroin and prostitute operations. 
   Remembering what Mary told him, Tony goes to the police and they bust 
   Santa Claus and raid Lila&#146;s house. Tony finds Mary and three 
   other naked girls in a hidden room in the attic. When he realizes 
   what has been done to Mary, he shoots Lila (with a gun given to him 
   by a cop!), killing her. Olaf jumps out of the attic window to avoid 
   police capture and dies from his wounds. This sleazy bit of 
   exploitation is really rough stuff. You can actually feel yourself 
   getting dirty as you are viewing it. The problem is that this is 
   well-made sleaze, which makes you all the more uncomfortable. When 
   Lila, who was once a nightclub performer before being scarred in a 
   fire, sings cabaret songs (with Olaf accompanying on the piano) for 
   her elderly drunk female friend, the scenes are intercut with the 
   captive girls being whipped, raped and going through withdrawal. 
   These scenes are effective and quite unnerving. The sex scenes are 
   near-pornographic, showing both male and female full frontal nudity 
   and simulated sex that nearly looks real (as a matter of fact, this 
   was actually shot as a hardcore porn film and was edited down to a 
   soft-X for theatrical play in most countries by Harry Novak and his 
   Boxoffice International Pictures). The real find in this film is 
   Torben, who, to the best of my knowledge, has never made another film 
   (He was actually a host of a Swedish TV kiddie show and made at least 
   one more porno film besides this one!). His many close-ups reveal 
   grotesque features which even the best makeup artists could not hope 
   to duplicate. He has a diabolical laugh that is goosebumb-inducing 
   and one gets the feeling that he is not acting when he relishes 
   injecting his captives with drugs, spying on Mary and Peter making 
   love and playing with his many wind-up toys (a motif throughout the 
   film). This is one truly frightening guy, regardless of his three 
   foot frame. In closing, let me say that you will sit spellbound while 
   viewing this film and hate yourself for watching it after it ends.

    Coordinator/Second Unit Director Michael Rae (who Produced this film 
   with actor Walter Robles, who appears in this film) went on to direct 
   one of&nbsp; Charles Band's best films of the late 80's, <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Laserblast1978">LASERBLAST</A></B> 
   (1978; his only directorial credit; as a matter of fact, his only

   film even though it is a total mess, just makes the film all the more 
   mysterious. And the &quot;What The Fuck?!?&quot; ending only adds to 
   the film's mystery. Here's the film in a nutshell (most of the actors 
   and the characters they play are guesses by me since the film doesn't 
   give us that information, but I am 90% sure of my choices). When 
   sisters Penelope (Nanci Sheldon; her only other credit is the porn 
   film <B><A HREF="politicians_1970.htm">THE POLITICIANS</A></B> a.k.a. <B><A HREF="politicians_1970.htm">NAKED...ARE
    THE CHEATERS</A></B> - 1970) and Patricia's (Cristy Beal; her only 
   credit) parents die in a car crash, they are sent off to live with 
   their uber-bossy Aunt and lecherous Uncle (who acts shy, but he loves 
   to watch beautiful girls undress). The Aunt and Uncle meet the 
   sisters at the train station, where the flirtatious Penelope (who 
   likes to be called Penny, so that is what I will call her from now 
   on) locks eyes on town hunk Gentry (Stephen Jacques; his only credit) 
   and we know that a romance will develop in the near future. Once they 
   get to the Aunt and Uncle's home, the sisters meets their obviously 
   retarded cousin Aubrey (John Talt, who is truly amazing here; his 
   only other credit is as Set Technician on <B><A HREF="flesh_gordon_1974.htm">FLESH
    GORDON</A></B> - 1974); he only sports a pair of white cutoff shorts 
   (throughout the ENTIRE film!), who clumsily carries their luggage to 
   their room. They also meet their normal (well, nearly normal) cousin 
   Edwina (Julie Connors; <B><A HREF="count_yorga_vampire_1970.htm">COUNT

   - 1970; she quit acting in 1972 after using numerous psyeudonyms and 
   getting nowhere), who welcomes the sisters with open arms (She really 
   is a nice person, at least until she tries to force herself on 
   Patricia for some lesbian action later in the film). When Aubrey 
   accidentally spills some of the things out of Patricia's suitcases 
   and locks eyes on her, he no longer looks at her like a cousin 
   anymore (you'll find out why soon). The Aunt really is a bossy bitch 
   and treats her husband and Aubrey like trash, which might be the 
   reason the way they are. We are then introduced to Zack (Parker 
   Herriott; his only credit) and his estranged father, who happens to 
   be the Preacher in the town. Zack wants his father to be more 
   assertive (even with him), but the Preacher is the rather timid type, 
   which is why he and Zach don't get along. We then watch as Penny's 
   Uncle watches her undress and he swings the bedroom door to act like 
   he is surprised to see he taking off her clothes, but Penny acts like 
   she doesn't mind and tells her Uncle he's more than welcome to stay, 
   because she is not embarassed at all to let people watch her undress. 
   The Uncle makes up a lame excuse and leaves the room. But that 
   doesn't stop Aubrey from watching her undress through a peephole 
   (just above a painting of a doll; that must be some type of 
   symbolism, but the film is so obtuse, I failed to make a connection). 
   When his mother asks Aubrey to go to the store to pick up some soap 
   for Penny and Patricia, he is playfully harassed by Zack and Gentry 
   because Aubrey is holding a page from a magazine showing a naked 
   girl. Gentry and Zack then ride their motorcycles (not hogs, just 
   regular motorcycles) to visit Penny and Patricia. Penny hops on the 
   back of Gentry's bike to do some &quot;sightseeing&quot; (in other 
   words, ball in the woods), while Zack and Patricia stay on the porch 
   to learn more about each other (another romance in bloom). The next 
   time we see Penny, she is asking her Uncle to unhook her bra from the 
   back (she loves to play with his emotions) and then takes a shower 
   with him in the bathroom; eventually she pulls him in the shower with 
   her (but we never see what happens; we can only guess). We then watch 
   members of a local motorcycle gang (again no hogs, just regular 
   motorcycles), where the overweight leader, Bluto Dangerfield (I have 
   no idea who portrays him, but he wears a red tee-shirt with the word 
   &quot;MONSTER&quot; on it) and other members watch two other members 
   beat the crap out of each other (all because one member threw a rock 
   at the other!), with the loser knocked unconscious, while the winner 
   is congratulated by the rest of the gang. In one of the film's most 
   unbelievable moments (The film becomes extremely weird after this), 
   Zack and Gentry agree to join the gang and they enter the town to 
   start harassing everyone. The Shefiff pulls out a rifle, but Bluto 
   and his gang make fun of him and take the rifle away from him. It is 
   at this time the Preacher decides to grow a set of balls and 
   chastizes the whole gang, including his son. Zack is quite proud of 
   him, but since he is now a member of the gang, he must leave with 
   them or lose face (now who is being the weenie?). As the Sheriff 
   leaves in his car, the Preacher is hit from behind with a pipe by the 
   creep member of the motorcycle gang who won the fight before (his 
   name is slang for a knife, but the sound is so bad, it is hard to 
   make out, so I'll call him Jim). The Preacher looks seriously injured 
   (the film's bloodiest moment), so the female flock tend to his 
   wounds. After the aforementioned lesbian encounter between Edwina and 
   Patricia, Aubrey watches it through the peephole and becomes very 
   angry. When Edwina leaves the room, Aubrey tries to rape Patricia, 
   but he can't get it up, so he runs out of the house and just keeps 
   running until he has nothing left in him. Seems Aubrey has settled in 
   a good hiding area where the motorcycle gang are holding an orgy. He 
   watches as Penny spikes Gentry's drink with way too much acid and 
   Gentry takes off on his motorcycle<A HREF="sinners_blood_1970_dvd.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sinner's blood dvd3 front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="280" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   with Penny on the back. Gentry begins to have a bad trip, so Penny 
   jumps off the bike and Jim drives his bike into a ravine, the bike 
   landing on top of him and exploding, killing him. Penny runs back to 
   the gang and tells them that Gentry is dead, unaware that Aubrey is 
   still there and knows exactly what happened. Jim (Buddy Arett) finds 
   Aubrey and stabs him in the stomach while the rest of the gang rides 
   away and Jim sexually assaults Penny with a knife to her breast (the 
   same scene the film opens with). Jim tells Penny that he loved Gentry 
   (as in homosexual love) and that &quot;all women are dirty&quot;. 
   When Zack and Patricia learn of Gentry's death when a seriously 
   injured Aubrey makes it to his house and they race to the scene to 
   save Penny, we are treated to one of the most &quot;What the 
   Fuck?!?&quot; moments in film history, as Jim and a few members of 
   the motorcycle gang are dressed in hospital scrubs and Penny is their 
   patient. Jim says he knows how to fix Penny and asks for his knife. 
   Then the film just ends.&nbsp; It's obvious the first and only time 
   director Neil Douglas had no idea how to make a film, as it is 
   nothing but a bunch of vignettes hardly connected at all, which makes 
   it a hoot and a half to watch. Who needs acid when we have <B><A HREF="sinners_blood_1970.htm">SINNER'S
    BLOOD</A></B>? The first time I watched this film was on the <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Miscellaneous">Genesis
    Home Video</A> VHS of the film, but the tape broke ten minutes in 
   and absolutely ruined my VCR (Genesis was not known for turning out 
   quality product). Luckily, Code Red offers a <A HREF="sinners_blood_1970_dvd.htm">widescreen
    anamorphic DVD</A> (taken from the only surviving 35mm print) which 
   also contains a fullscreen 3/4&quot; tape master version that 
   contains an extra scene. The biggest difference in the film is that 
   the widescreen version only offers a card insert of the film's title 
   (which makes it look like it was retitled from something else), but 
   the 3/4&quot; tape master offers the full cast &amp; crew credits, 
   but doesn't offer any character information that the cast played 
   (Except for John Talt as &quot;Aubrey&quot;). The extra scene adds 
   nothing to the film, so watch the widescreen version, even though it 
   has its share of emulsion scratches. This is one film that will leave 
   your brain twirling after watching it, so if you are already high on 
   something, DO NOT watch this film. Nearly everyone in this film 
   (besides Zack and Patricia) are scumbags, so don't go into this film 
   thinking that you are going to end up feeling good. All you will be 
   left feeling is confused, but in a good way. The DVD opens with a 
   dedication to the late Sage &quot;Moonblood&quot; Stallone, who 
   absolutely loved the character of of Aubrey. Enough to let William 
   Olsen and Code Red use his 35mm print for this DVD. Sage Stallone 
   died of a drug overdose soon after. Most of the footage in this film

   women characters. 'Sixpack' Annie Bodine (Lindsay Bloom; <B><A HREF="cover_girl_models_1975.htm">COVER
    GIRL MODELS</A></B> - 1975) and best friend Mary Lou (Jana Bellan; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Murder Gang">THE
    MURDER GANG</A></B> - 1976) work at Aunt Tess' (Danna Hansen) 
   country diner; that is whenever they're not drinking (Annie keeps a 
   well-stocked cooler full of cans of Miller beer in her pickup truck) 
   or screwing (Annie's boyfriend Billy Joe is played by a baby-faced 
   Bruce Boxleitner, in his feature film debut). When Aunt Tess learns 
   that she may lose her diner because she can't pay the mortgage, Annie 
   and Mary Lou must find a way to get hold of $5641.87 within seven 
   days to save the diner from foreclosure. In between fighting off the 
   advances of lecherous, bumbling fat Sheriff Waters (Joe Higgins), who 
   offers Annie the money if she'll marry him (turns out he doesn't have 
   a pot to piss in and he only wanted to get into her cut-offs) or 
   trying to stay away from the always-horny Bustis (Larry Mahon), Annie 
   and Mary Lou travel to Miami to get the money from Annie's rich 
   sister, Flora (Louisa Moritz; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#New Years Evil">NEW
    YEAR'S EVIL</A></B> - 1980), only to discover that Flora is a gold 
   digger (in other words, a prostitute), who has less money than Annie<A HREF="sixpack_annie_1975.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/six pack annie poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="188" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>.
    Annie takes Flora's advice and goes looking for a sugar daddy, with 
   Mary Lou as her &quot;manager&quot; (They shop for clothes at a 
   Fredericks Of Hollywood outlet and the inexperienced Mary Lou 
   interviews prospective sugar daddies by asking them questions like, 
   &quot;Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist 
   Party?&quot;). After a disastrous first attempt at finding a sugar 
   daddy (the guy dresses like Napoleon and wants Annie to kiss his 
   feet!), Annie meets the seemingly rich Mr. O'Meyer (Ray Danton; 
   director of <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Deathmaster">DEATHMASTER</A></B> 
   - 1972; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Crypt of Living Dea">CRYPT OF 
   THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> - 1973 and <B><A HREF="psychic_killer_1975.htm">PSYCHIC
    KILLER</A></B> - 1975) at a bar (He tells Annie that the 
   &quot;O&quot; stands for &quot;Oscar&quot; and she falls for it!), 
   while Mary Lou takes a job at a cocktail lounge (she is forced to 
   dress like a sexy rat!). Mr. O'Meyer turns out to be nothing but a 
   conman who only wants to get into Annie's panties. After getting what 
   he wants, O'Meyer steals all Annie's money and disappears., forcing 
   Annie and Mary Lou to return home. Just when everything looks 
   hopeless, the diner is saved in the nick of time when a previously-thought
    worthless bauble Annie picked up on her travels turns out to be 
   extremely valuable.&nbsp; While nothing but a series of pretty tame 
   sex scenes, fish-out-of water sequences and ribald <B>HEE-HAW</B>-style
    humor (the camera often cuts away to two old-timers sitting in the 
   diner [played by Doodles Weaver and Ronald Marriott] as they tell 
   each other double entendre sex jokes), mixed with funny cameo bits 
   (Stubby Kaye as a traveling salesman who has nearly anything you 
   could possibly want hidden somewhere on his body; Richard Kennedy as 
   a drunk Texan in a Miami bar; Pedro Gonzalez Gonzales as a Miami 
   bartender; Sid Shelton as one of Flora's customers), <B>SIX PACK ANNIE</B> 
   is still an enjoyable romp, even if some of the puns and visual jokes 
   are groan-inducing. I found myself laughing out loud on several 
   occasions against my better judgment, such as when Annie and Mary Lou 
   unintentionally pick up two gay hitchhikers on their way to Miami or 
   Flora farting when she gets nervous. Both Lindsay Bloom and Jana 
   Bellan are fine as the sex-starved, but strong-willed Southern belles 
   who get into more comical scrapes than the Three Stooges. All the 
   nude scenes come courtesy of Ms. Bloom (Bruce Boxleitner also appears 
   bare-assed), though Ms. Bellan shows off her fine assets in some 
   form-fitting outfits. The standout here is Richard Kennedy (a.k.a. 
   &quot;Wolfgang Roehm&quot; in the first two <B><A HREF="ilsa_she_wolf_of_the_ss_1974.htm">ILSA</A></B> 
   films) as the rambunctious, rich Texan drunk Jack Whittlestone. 
   Whenever he's on-screen, you can't help but laugh. Director/producer 
   John C. Broderick (<B><A HREF="bad_georgia_road_1976.htm">BAD GEORGIA ROAD</A></B>-
    1976; <B><A HREF="warrior_and_the_sorceress_1984.htm">THE WARRIOR 
   AND THE SORCERESS</A></B> - 1984), who directed this using the 
   pseudonym &quot;Graydon F. David&quot;, doesn't offer anything new 
   here (the jokes are as old as a baggy-pants burlesque routine), but 
   the film has an infectious, innocent charm (even the nude scenes 
   don't feel salicious) that makes the whole story (script by Norman 
   Winski, David Kidd and Wil David) nothing but good, harmless fun. I 
   enjoyed it quite a bit. Billy Barty puts in an uncredited&nbsp; 
   appearance as a pie-carrying little person in the film's closing 
   shot. Also starring Vince Barnett, Steve Randall, Donald Elson, Oscar 
   Cartier and Montana Smoyer. As far as I could tell, this American 
   International Pictures theatrical release never had a legitimate U.S. 
   home video release in any form. A lot of gray market sellers have it 
   available on DVD-R. <B>Rated R</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

   their plane's instrumentation is jammed and they are forced to crash 
   land on an uncharted island occupied by machine gun-toting Amazons in 
   miniskirts. They are taken prisoner and marched through the hot sun 
   by three of the women and camp out when the sun goes down. At 
   midnight, one of the girls makes love to Joe next to a roaring fire. 
   The next day, after another long walk, Joe and Troy are put on a boat 
   (one of the women says, &quot;We've captured some game.&quot;) and 
   watch the three women strip naked and <A HREF="slaves_of_love_1969.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/slaves of loves poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>wade
    in the water. More women show up and shed their clothes, too (Where 
   is this island?). All Joe and Troy can do is watch because &quot;The 
   ugliest bitch you ever saw&quot; is standing next to them, ready to 
   use her machine gun if they move. Joe and Troy overpower the 
   &quot;ugly bitch&quot; and Troy shoots one of the women, killing her 
   (beats me why he did it). The skipper arrives and gets the drop on 
   Troy and they are transported by boat to another island where they 
   are led to the futuristic (for 1969) base of the Chief (Tina Brown). 
   Troy is tortured and given thirty lashes for killing the woman. Joe 
   is told by the Chief he must make love to all the women and herself 
   (Where is this island?) and is given a love potion to help him out. 
   More women dance around topless while Joe watches in a drugged-out 
   haze. As Joe is making love to five women, Troy is getting whipped on 
   his back until it bleeds. When Joe is unable to satisfy all the 
   women, the Chief orders her girls to kill him and Troy. But, the 
   women who was whipping Troy has secretly made a deal with him to 
   escape as long as they take her with them. As they escape, Troy and 
   the woman are killed and Joe gets away and tells his story to some 
   friends in a bar. They don't believe him, even though he has a bullet 
   hole in his arm.&nbsp; This film is just an excuse to show as much 
   naked female flesh as it possibly can. Nothing more, nothing less. 
   Director Nizet (who was murdered in Brazil in 2003) just keeps 
   showing shot after shot of naked, unaugmented women swimming in the 
   water, lying topless on a boat soaking up the sun or frolicking on 
   land while awful library music plays in the background (including a 
   Dixieland version of &quot;Will The Circle Be Unbroken&quot;!). Much 
   of the film is shot silent and most of it is narrated by Joe, who 
   tells the entire story in flashback at a bar, so we know he survives. 
   I have the feeling that Mr. Nizet knew a lot of strippers, because 
   there are many scenes of women dancing in their g-strings (although 
   the women are naked, they are filmed in such a way to avoid shots of 
   pubic hair, typical of 60's sexploitationers), gyrating to jazzy 
   music. There's not much meat to this film, but I doubt there was 
   meant to be. <B><A HREF="slavesoflove1969.htm">S</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="slavesoflove1969.htm">LAVES

   Network's <B>UP ALL NIGHT</B> during the late 80's to early 90's 
   (minus all the nudity and bad language, of course). Three college

   (Brinke Stevens) and Lisa (Michelle Bauer) and then squirting whipped 
   cream on them. The three guys get caught watching Taffy and Lisa 
   taking a shower by pledge mistress Babs (Robin Rochelle) and she 
   makes them go with the two pledges and break into the local bowling 
   alley (that's in the middle of a mall). They have to<A HREF="sorority_babes_slimeball_bowl_o_rama_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sorority babes in the slimeball bowl-o-rama vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="126" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   bring back a bowling trophy as proof of the break-in. If they do, 
   Taffy and Lisa will become part of the sorority and Babs will not 
   call the cops on the three guys. They break into the bowling alley, 
   not aware that Babs and two cohorts are watching their every move on 
   the security cameras. They also meet Spider (Linnea Quigley), who has 
   already broken in and is robbing all the cash registers and video 
   game coin boxes. The group steals a trophy, accidentally drop it and 
   a wisecracking imp escapes from it and offers everyone one wish 
   apiece. Jimmy (Hal Havins) wishes for a pile of gold, Keith (John 
   Stuart Wildman) wishes for Lisa to have sex with him and Taffy wishes 
   to be prom queen. All three wishes backfire rather quickly as the imp 
   possesses Bab's two cohorts and then begin killing the cast. Jimmy is 
   decapitated, his head used as a bowling ball on one of the alleys. 
   Keith gets his face deep-fried and Taffy has her bones dislocated 
   from their joints. Spider and Calvin (Andras Jones) join forces and 
   with some information garnered from the mall's deaf janitor, they try 
   to put the imp back in the trophy while trying to avoid the possessed 
   sorority demonesses. They succeed, but one thing really bothers me 
   after watching this film: Why were two gorgeous women trying to get 
   into a sorority that only has three members? It's no wonder the boys 
   call it &quot;Felta Delta&quot;. Their parties must be very 
   intimate.&nbsp; An early directorial credit for David DeCoteau (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Dreamaniac">DREAMANIAC</A></B> 
   - 1986; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Leeches">LEECHES</A></B> - 
   2003), this low-budget horror comedy (that actually got a theatrical 
   release) is an OK time-waster if you happen to be in the right frame 
   of mind (i.e. stoned). There's a running gag where the mall's deaf 
   janitor (the late <A HREF="george buck flower.htm">George 
   &quot;Buck&quot; Flower</A>, using his &quot;C.D. LaFleur&quot; 
   pseudonym) keeps getting locked in a closet. He knows all about the 
   imp and his interrogation by Spider and Calvin, where he doesn't hear 
   the questions correctly, is the film's comedic high point. Brinke 
   Stevens and Michelle Bauer (here billed as &quot;Michelle 
   McClellen&quot;) are naked or half-dressed for most of their screen 
   time, but Linnea Quigley (unfortunately) stays clothed throughout. 
   The imp (voiced by Michael Sonye as &quot;Dukey Flyswatter&quot;, who 
   is made to sound like Audrey in the remake of <B><A HREF="little_shop_of_horrors_1986.htm">LITTLE
    SHOP OF HORRORS</A></B> - 1986) is the weakest part of the film, 
   cracking third-rate jokes while most of the cast dies. If you're 
   looking for blood and gore, this is not the film for you as there is 
   no blood whatsoever, just the aforementioned rolling head and frier 
   scalding. Still, it's an enjoyable romp, livened by frequent nudity 
   and George &quot;Buck&quot; Flower's all-too-brief appearance. I dare 
   you not to laugh out loud when he says, &quot;God-damn, that fucking

   Modern day (well, for 1976, that is) Filipino pirate flick with a 
   heavy dose of sleaze. Pirates take over a luxury cruise ship, robbing 
   the passengers of all their money and jewels and raping all the 
   pretty females they come in contact with. Also on-board is Interpol 
   agent George (Junero Jennings; <B><A HREF="#Superchick">SUPERCHICK</A></B>

   career-destroying role), who are handcuffed to each other. Rather 
   than fighting the pirates, they jump overboard and wash ashore a 
   tropical island, where George and Steve are met by a tribe of natives 
   and taken to their chief, Siram (Vic Vargas; <B><A HREF="intrusion_cambodia_1981.htm">INTRUSION:
    CAMBODIA</A></B> - 1981), who welcomes them to the island (he 
   doesn't seem too concerned that they are still handcuffed to each 
   other!). Siram introduces the pair to his beautiful daughters, Sari 
   and Silima (the chief is way too trusting!) and later on George and

    into a knock-down, drag-out fight (while still handcuffed to each 
   other), which forces Siram to demand that George release Steve from 
   his shackles to restore &quot;harmony&quot; to their peaceful island. 
   George reluctantly agrees (Where is Steve going to go? They're on an 
   uncharted island!) and Siram makes both George and Steve honorary 
   members of the tribe, even going as far as to offering them their 
   choice of woman to spend the rest of their lives with (Steve replies, 
   &quot;Only one?&quot;). Steve picks the beautiful Myla (Eva Reyes), 
   while George sets his sights on Sari. The harmony of the peaceful 
   island suddenly comes to an end when the pirates land on the island 
   with plans of making it their home base. Siram and his tribe offer 
   the same deal to the pirates as they did to George and Steve, but 
   it's not long before the pirates begin raping the native women 
   (including Myla and Sari) and gunning-down the native men. Steve and 
   George put aside their hatred for each other (it's revealed that 
   Steve killed George's brother in self-defense while working in a 
   mine, but George refuses to believe that his brother was responsible 
   for a cave-in that killed several people) and work together to free 
   the natives once Silima is killed and pirate leader Marco (Eddie 
   Garcia) demands to marry Sari. Thanks to a cache of weapons left on 
   the island during World War II, Steve and George lead the natives on 
   a bloody revenge spree, shooting and slicing their way through the 
   pirates until they are all dead. But victory comes with a deadly 
   price.&nbsp; Though pretty slow moving for the first half, the film 
   picks up considerable steam once the pirates set foot on the island.

   - 1983), offers copious male and female nudity (some full frontal 
   from both sexes) and some surprisingly graphic gore, including a 
   bloody decapitation by machete, various blood-gushing stabbings and 
   gory bullet hits. The film's biggest weakness is the choppy editing 
   by future director Segundo Ramos (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#DeadlyCommando">DEADLY
    COMMANDO</A></B> - 1982; <B><A HREF="action.htm#DeathRaiders1984">DEATH

   or reason, especially the sudden appearance of the pirates on the 
   island (Where did they come from?) or the equally sudden and 
   confusing appearance of Navy rescuers in the finale (How did they 
   know to go there?). The film is also a little too rape-happy for its 
   own good, as every woman is either slapped, punched or kicked while 
   having their clothes ripped off and raped. It gets tiring after a 
   while and much of it reeks of overkill (unless you're the type of 
   sick bastard that gets off on this). Troy Donahue is simply awful as 
   Steve and he plays his character as an aloof asshole who seems to 
   side with whomever has the upper hand at the time, even going as far 
   as to whip George with twenty lashes on Marco's orders. If Donahue 
   were any stiffer, he would be sprouting branches and giving the rest 
   of the cast splinters. Still, <B><A HREF="south_seas_massacre_1974b.htm">SOUTH

    HELL CAMP</A><A NAME="SSHellCamp1977"></A> (1977) -</B> I've been 
   reviewing a ton of Italian genre films lately and most of them are 
   quite good, if not totally screwed-up. Now I'm reviewing the dark 
   side of Italian filmmaking: The Naziploitation genre. I say &quot;dark
    side&quot; because Italy should know better than to churn out 
   countless film that exploited this subject matter. After all, they 
   sided with the Nazis during World War II&nbsp; and were responsible 
   for hundreds of thousand deaths, many of those victims being their 
   own citizens. It's not only in bad taste to make this kind of<A HREF="ss_hell_camp_1977.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ss hell camp dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="217" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   film (and we all know that I love bad taste), but it's also a slap in 
   the face to those who spent years in concentration camps and watched 
   as family members and friends were being tortured or slaughtered. Can 
   you imagine the uproar that would develop if Israel made films like 
   this? You may say, &quot;Hey Fred, lighten up!&quot; but I firmly 
   believe there are lines that should not be crossed. I know there are 
   fans of this genre and I'm not knocking you. But I understand the 
   other side of the fence, where millions of people were killed in the 
   Holocaust and the neverending pain it caused, even after 70+ years 
   after it happened. To make films that exploit these emotions is 
   unforgivable, in my opinion, but I feel it is my duty to review at 
   least a couple of these films (I reviewed <B><A HREF="#SS Experiment">SS
    EXPERIMENT CAMP</A></B> - 1976 [See above] way back in the late '80s 
   and I haven't watched or reviewed another film in this genre...until now.).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film opens with German Dr. Ellen Kratsch (Macha Magall; <B><A HREF="ss_girls_1977.htm">SS
    GIRLS</A></B> - 1977) injecting a hairy ape-man called &quot;The 
   Beast&quot; (&quot;Sal Boris&quot; a.k.a. Salvatore Baccaro; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Starcrash">STARCRASH</A></B> 
   - 1979) with a virility serum and subjecting a naked virginal female 
   &quot;non-collaborator&quot; to the naked Beast's charms. Dr. Kratsch 
   hopes that the Beast will procreate with these women, getting them 
   pregnant and spawning a new kind of soldier that is strong and will 
   do the Nazi's bidding, no questions asked. What Dr. Kratsch doesn't 
   count on are the Beast's natural instincts, as he fucks the poor 
   virgin every way to Sunday, grunting and drooling as he forces his 
   way inside her and he eventually kills her, but it doesn't stop him 
   from continuing to screw her! Even so, Dr. Kratsch seems satisfied 
   with her experiment and even gets turned-on.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then watch as a couple of partisans invade a Nazi outpost&nbsp; 
   and blow up&nbsp; a train full of German soldiers and a bridge 
   essential to the Nazis for supplies and ammo. German soldier Capt. 
   Hardinghauser (Kim Gatti; a Unit Publicist on <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Alien 2">ALIEN
    2</A></B> - 1980) is screwing a prostitute when he is interrupted by 
   a phone call from his general, who tells him about the train and the 
   bridge. He wants the Captain to round up as many partisans as he can 
   so the Nazis can teach them a deadly lesson. The Captain and his men 
   then raid a village, killing men and women with reckless abandon. In 
   one scene of extreme bad taste, the soldiers take a baby from his 
   mother's arms, toss it in the air and use it for target practice! The 
   women and children are crying at such a sight and the Captain grabs 
   one child for use later on.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The partisans, led by Lupo (Xiros Papas; &quot;Mosaic&quot; in <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Frankenstein 80">FRANKENSTEIN
    '80</A></B> - 1972), vow revenge and use local prostitute Irene 
   (Brigitte Skay; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BayOfBlood1971">A BAY OF BLOOD</A></B> 
   - 1971) as a spy. The Captain tries to get the group of partisan 
   prisoners he captured to talk and when they won't he uses the child 
   in a game of Russian roulette, resulting in the death of the child's 
   father (a nice round bullethole in the middle of his forehead), yet 
   the partisans still refuse to talk. Dr. Kratsch tells the Captain 
   that she will be able to get them to talk if he'll let her deal with 
   them on &quot;her terms&quot;. The partisans don't trust Lupo and 
   think he may be a double agent (One partisan says, &quot;We seem to 
   be at the mercy of priests and prostitutes!&quot;). Lupo is talking 
   to a priest, Don Lorenzo (Brad Harris; <B><A HREF="#Zambo1972">ZAMBO, 
   KING OF THE JUNGLE</A></B> - 1972), when Irene enters the church and 
   warns Lupo that the Germans are coming. Lupo doesn't want to flee 
   because he has a sick wife and young son at home, but Irene and 
   Father Lorenzo tell him that they will take care of his family. The 
   good Father gives Lupo his rosary and he flees (This film's idea of 
   sympathy.). The Germans invade the village, where the Captain rapes a 
   young woman to get her partisan brother to come out of hiding and 
   surrender, which he does. The remaining partisans feel uneasy, as if 
   something deadly is about to happen. If they only knew.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Dr. Kratsch with a bunch of naked male partisans, who 
   are hanging by their arms (nothing is left to the imagination). Dr. 
   Kratsch whips the men in the crotch with a riding crop and then she 
   takes off her top and rubs her breasts all over one prisoner's naked 
   body. She then pulls out a bayonette and cuts off the penis of 
   another prisoner. It is then revealed that a female partisan is <A HREF="beast_in_heat_1977.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/beast in heat italy poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="213" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>a

    This is a piss-poor film that wallows in scenes of torture, where 
   women are jolted in their private parts with electricity, have their 
   fingers cut off, have rats chewing their bodies or having the Beast 
   screw them to death. This film is so desperate to shock that it shows 
   the Beast ripping off a woman's pubic hair and eating it, while a 
   female Nazi officer licks her lips, all in loving close-up. This film 
   also borrows war footage from other films (the film stock changes fro 
   scene to scene). Be aware that there is just as much male 
   full-frontal nudity as there is female and director Luigi Batzella (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Devil's wedding">THE

   nothing but pure torture to sit through, as it is horrendously acted 
   (Salvatore Baccaro should be ashamed of himself), atrociously dubbed 
   (some of the partisans have Southern and Brooklyn accents!) and the 
   action is poorly staged (No bullet squibs here. When someone is shot, 
   they grab their chest and fall down. One guy anticipates an explosion 
   before it happens and jumps in the air a good second before the 
   boom!). We are supposed to feel relief when the Beast grabs Dr. 
   Kratsch and screws her to death, but the only relief you will have is 
   when this film finally ends. The only thing I felt here was pity.

    ensuing madness, but now someone is killing members of the gang 
   one-by-one. The first one is decapitated when a wire is strung across 
   the road as he is passing on his motorcycle. The second one is killed 
   when his motorcycle explodes as he starts it up. A third one is 
   killed when he is run off the road and drives off a cliff. At the 
   funeral for the third member, (where he is buried standing up so he 
   &quot;doesn't have to take anything from the Evil One [Satan] lying 
   down&quot;), the remaining members of the Gravediggers vow revenge to 
   whomever is responsible. The police try to question them at the 
   cemetery, but the Gravediggers' leader, Undertaker (Sandy Harbutt), 
   tells them to 'piss off&quot; as they will solve the murders on their 
   own. Enter policeman Stone (Ken Shorter). He comes riding in on his 
   motorcycle, all dressed in white leather and enters the Gravedigger's 
   local hangout. He tells the Gravediggers that he was sent to solve 
   the murders of their friends and, after saving Undertaker's life from 
   a sniper's crossbow, the gang votes to let him be a temporary member 
   until they catch the killer (the voting isn't unanimously in Stone's 
   favor, though). At first, it's a very uneasy alliance between Stone 
   and the Gravediggers (their clubhouse is an old WWII bunker 
   overlooking the ocean), but the gang eventually indoctrinate him into 
   their circle, piercing his ear (!) and pouring beer all over him. 
   It's not long before Stone and Undertaker begin admiring each other 
   as human beings. They may not like each other, but each begins to 
   understand the other's way of life. As Stone begins his 
   investigation, he's surprised how well thought of the Gravediggers 
   are by the surrounding community. When a rival gang, the Black Hawks, 
   swing into town, the corporation that hired the sniper sees this as a 
   way to kill all the Gravediggers and blame it on the rival gang. 
   After a gunfight between the Gravediggers and the bad guys, Stone 
   catches the sniper and brings him to justice, which pisses-off the 
   Gravediggers, who dole-out a surprising bit of payback to Stone in 
   the bloody finale. There is a code to the biker culture and Stone is 
   about to learn it in a most painful manner. It sets up a sequel 
   which, unfortunately, never materialized.&nbsp; This Australian 
   offshoot of 60's American biker films is an entertaining 
   action/exploitation flick that has much to recommend, even if this is 
   a low-budget affair. Director/producer/co-scri<A HREF="stone_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/stone 1974 british vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="138" HEIGHT="233" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>pter/star

   Australian TV version of <B><A HREF="jesus_christ_superstar_1973.htm">JESUS
    CHRIST SUPERSTAR</A></B>!) infuses this film with a sense of 
   humanity, as the bikers are living, breathing people and are not 
   portrayed as one-note shit-kickers. Sure, they get into trouble every 
   now and then, drop acid and get into fights, but they are basically 
   good guys just looking out for each other, like some extended 
   screwed-up family (and who doesn't know what that's like?). Ken 
   Shorter as Stone is a strange-looking chap and seems an odd choice as 
   the hero of the film, but the more he is on-screen, the more he grows 
   on you. This film also has one of the strangest music scores (by 
   Billy Green) you will ever hear, full of howling voices at one moment 
   and then a simple acoustic guitar solo the next. Very unusual and 
   effective. It just wouldn't be a biker film without some of the 
   staples of the genre and this one doesn't disappoint. There's a 
   couple of druggy &quot;trip&quot; scenes (one leads to everyone 
   skinnydipping in the ocean), a bar fight, a motorcycle race between 
   Stone and the Gravediggers' best rider, plenty of nudity (both male 
   and female) and lots of colorful gang member names, including Septic,

   Stinkfinger. If you're a fan of biker films, <B><A HREF="stone_1973b.htm">STONE</A></B>

    GIRLS</A><A NAME="StreetGirls1974"></A> (1974) -</B> Sordid tale 
   about whores, strippers, pimps, drugs and the people who love, abuse 
   and use them. Angel (Chris Souder) is a small town 
   girl-turned-stripper who is very confused. She is carrying-on a 
   lesbian affair with fellow stripper Sally (Carol Chase), but has 
   trysts with men, including drug dealer Mario (Jay Derringer), which 
   doesn't sit too well with Sally. Mario turns Angel into a heroin 
   addict and she becomes a prostitute to feed her habit. Angel's 
   father, Sven (Art Burke), a naive Midwestern man (who believes you 
   can catch VD from a toilet seat or get hooked on Smith Bros. cough 
   drops!) becomes worried when he doesn't hear from his daughter, so he 
   heads off to the Big City in search of her. He's about to get an 
   education on the seedier aspects of life. Irv (Paul Pompian, also a 
   Producer here), the owner of the strip club, is using the club as a 
   front to turn his strippers into call girls. He simply has Mario get 
   them hooked on smack and then makes them turn tricks for their next 
   fix. As you can probably guess, Irv is making a mint as a secret pimp 
   and Angel is going is going to be the newest addition to his stable. 
   When Sven enters town, the first person he meets is Albert (Michael 
   Albert Walker), a schizophrenic babbler who just happens to be 
   Sally's brother. Albert takes Sven to Irv's club to meet Sally, who 
   is dancing there that night. Sally takes S<A HREF="street_girls_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/street girls poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="169" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>ven
    to the communal home where she lives and Sven meets a good 
   cross-section of the counterculture community, including Albert, who 
   is now dressed as a woman! Sally lies to Sven and tells him that 
   Angel is on a year-long cruise around the world, but he gets pissed 
   and storms out of the house when she tells him that she and Angel are 
   lesbian lovers (Sven disgustingly says, &quot;My daughter would never 
   get involved in such filth!&quot;). If he only knew the whole truth. 
   Angel's first professional trick is a grease monkey in a motel room, 
   who hands her a pair of scuba goggles and tells her to lay in the 
   bathtub. You guessed it, he wants to piss on her (!) and when Angel 
   refuses and locks herself in the bathroom, Irv later gives her a 
   black eye and threatens to turn her out on the street, making her a 
   five dollar street whore. As Sven gets closer to finding his daughter 
   (thanks to a tip from a black prostitute), Angel sinks further and 
   further into a pit of despair and drug addiction. When Sally tries to 
   save Angel (it's strictly for her own benefit and has nothing to do 
   with Angel), she pays for it with her life. Sven is assaulted and 
   beaten to a pulp, but his determination will finally lead him to his 
   daughter. Even though he knows what Angel has become, his experience 
   over the last few days turn him into a different man and he hugs his 
   daughter. It's a hug a father could only give his daughter.&nbsp;

   two films (clueless father must search for his daughter in a 
   landscape totally alien to him) is no less diminished by <B>STREET</B>'s
    ultra-low-budget and cast of non-pros. Quite the contrary. This 
   film's lack of budget and raw acting actually enhance the 
   proceedings, making the plentiful nudity (mostly by women who are 
   non-enhanced in the chest region and are plain janes in the looks 
   department) and gritty location photography (filmed in Eugene, 
   Oregon) seem natural and urgent. The music soundtrack (featuring 
   songs by Muddy Waters) also gives the film a distinct 70's feel, as 
   do the fashions and hairstyles. It's in no way a perfect film (the 
   ending is a little too quick, like director Miller ran out of money 
   and condensed all the loose ends into a final two minutes), but it's 
   a compact 84 minute, fast-moving look into the inner workings of a 
   lifestyle most of us would rather not think about. Also starring

   also used the pseudomym &quot;Adam Lawrence&quot; in <A HREF="suckers_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/suckers poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="186" HEIGHT="280" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>films
    like <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Drive In Massacre">DRIVE-IN MASSACRE</A></B> 
   - 1976) invites a female photographer, her business partner husband, 
   two fashion models and another professional hunter to his out-of-the-way
    hunting reserve where they eventually become the prey. I say 
   eventually because you have to put up with nearly an hour of softcore 
   sex scenes (complete with flaccid male penises and shots of hairy 
   ball sacks), both straight and lesbian, while library music plays in 
   the background. Once we finally get to the actually hunt, there seems 
   to be an entire reel missing, as Vandemeer announces that they are 
   going to be his and his two sidekicks' prey and then the film jumps 
   to everyone already separated and running through the woods. One 
   model is captured, brought back to the house by one of the sidekicks, 
   raped and then stabbed repeatedly with a hunting knife (we never see 
   the deed, only the bloody knife after the stabbing). The female 
   photographer is raped and shot by Vandemeer (both offscreen) after 
   her husband is knocked unconcious. The other model is captured by the 
   second sidekick, but she pleads with him not to hurt her and offers 
   him a huge amount of money she saw back at the house. Vandemeer hears 
   the whole thing and shoots the sidekick dead (this time on-screen). 
   She gets away and is saved by the other professional hunter who is 
   also the prey. He and she fall for the old rope trap trick when they 
   find the naked bloody body of the female photographer and Vandemeer 
   ties them both to trees.&nbsp; Vandemeer threatens to skin the model 
   alive, but his plans are foiled when the photographer's husband fires 
   a pistol at Vandemeer and the hunter breaks free from the tree, 
   because he had a hunting knife hidden behind his back (Why didn't 
   Vandemeer search him before tying him to a tree?). He and Vandemeer 
   get into a knife fight and, just as Vandemeer is about to kill him, 
   the model grabs Vandemeer's rifle and shoots him dead. That's all 
   folks. Like I said before, the film elements are a total disaster 
   (nothing like their <A HREF="dungeon_of_harrow_1962_death_by_invitation_1971_dvd.htm">double

   full of noticeable errors, such as when everyone calls their vehicle 
   a &quot;Jeep&quot; when you can actually see the &quot;Ford&quot; 
   insignia on the front grill. Although there is plenty of non-silicone 
   enhanced nudity and hairy bushes (but no actual visible penetration 
   or &quot;money shots&quot;), almost none of it is erotic and most of 
   those scenes go on much too long (The rape, on the other hand, only 
   lasts for about 30 seconds). I've said this many times before: Just 
   because a film is considered &quot;rare&quot; or &quot;lost&quot;

   (1973) -</B> Oddball and rather tame piece of 70's sexploitation 
   about stewardess Tara B. True (Joyce Jillson; a 70's film &amp; TV 
   actress who gave up the profession to become a world-famous 
   syndicated newspaper astrologer, as well as an astrologist to the 
   stars, before passing away in 2004), a.k.a. &quot;Superchick&quot;, a 
   swinging single woman who changes her appearance in every port of 
   call (in the opening seconds of the film, she changes in a phone 
   booth [ala Superman] from a frumpy brunette to a stunning blonde in a 
   skintight pair of black leather short-shorts) to keep her identity 
   secret from her three boyfriends: Rich brain surgeon Ernest (Thomas 
   Reardon) in New York, who will fuck Tara but won't let her kiss him 
   on the mouth because of his &quot;germ&quot; issues (they shake hands 
   instead!); playboy Johnny (Tony Young) in Miami, a degenerate gambler 
   who owes a ton of money to mobster Mr. Garrick (Louis Quinn); and 
   musician Davy Charles (Timothy Wayne Brown) in Los Angeles, a famous 
   pop singer who has two top ten singles and a hit TV show. Tara 
   certainly lives up to her Superchick nickname, because she's not only 
   hell in the sack, she also has an unquenchable sexual energy that no 
   one can seem to drain. Tara's secret identities come crashing down 
   around her when Mr. Garrick discovers who she really is after 
   accidentally watching her change from frumpy stewardess to sexy <A HREF="superchick_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/superchick poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="185" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>passenger
    in mid-air to indoctrinate a recently returned Marine into the Mile 
   High Club (it is her patriotic duty after all!). Mr. Garrick 
   blackmails Tara to deliver packages for him across the country or he 
   will not only unmask her secret identity, he will also kill Johnny. 
   Along on her adventures, Tara meets lesbian porno star Mayday 
   (sexploitation vet Uschi Digard) and goes to a drug-fueled party with 
   her and Davy's associate Sims (Junero Jennings), where Tara and Sims 
   smoke pot in a closet while a pair of cops raid the party (and sample 
   the weed!). Tara transforms herself into her frumpy alter ego and 
   talks the older cop (Norman Bartold) into letting her go, leaving 
   Sims and Mayday to their own devices (they get arrested!). As she is 
   walking through a park, she is accosted by a flasher (She looks at 
   his dick and says, &quot;You poor dear!&quot;) and then by a 
   pot-smoking motorcycle gang (one of the bikers is portrayed by an 
   uncredited Dan Haggerty), who want to gang-bang her, but she beats 
   them all up with her superior kung-fu skills (offscreen) and steals 
   one of their bikes. After a few more exploits, Tara is put on the 
   spot when a &quot;package&quot; she delivers turns out to be guns 
   being used for a mid-air hijack attempt on a flight she is working 
   on. Tara defeats the hijackers, which gives her unwanted national TV 
   exposure and a hospital stay. Ernest, Johnny and Davy rush to her 
   hospital bed in one of the most unbelievable, knuckle-headed 
   conclusions I have seen in quite a while.&nbsp; This underwhelming 
   exploitationer, directed by Ed Forsythe (<B><A HREF="inferno_in_paradise_1974.htm">INFERNO

   the party, as well as supplying cringe-worthy dialogue like,

   nothing but a series of loosely connected vignettes that showcase 
   Joyce Jillson's assets (although the end credits state that a body 
   double was used for some of her nude scenes). While there is plenty 
   of nudity from nearly every female cast member (Uschi Digard has a 
   nice full-frontal scene on the set of an S&amp;M porno shoot), 
   clearly 90% of the screen time belongs to Ms. Jillson and it's no 
   coincidence that she soon changed careers after appearing in this. 
   Her acting talents are less than stellar and this film suffers 
   because of it (try watching her play &quot;stoned&quot; while in the 
   closet or reaching &quot;orgasm&quot; while listening to classical 
   music in Ernest's living room). John Carradine puts in an 
   embarrassing five minute cameo as aging horror star Igor Smith, who 
   keeps an S&amp;M dungeon in his mansion and has the funniest line in 
   the entire film (It comes right after Tara asks him, &quot;What would 
   your mother say?&quot;). Otherwise, <B><A HREF="superchick_1973b.htm">SUPERCHICK</A></B> 
   is a dated exploitation flick that ends on one of the most 
   preposterous denouements in recent memory (Believe me, you'll be

   Jack Wells, Gus Peters, Phil Hoover, Steve Drexel and Dale Ishimoto.

   - 1973) is set-up on a phony marijuana bust and makes a deal with the 
   police chief to cut sugar cane in a work camp for two years in lieu 
   of a trial. She should have stuck with the trial. The work camp turns 
   out to be much worse than any prison, as the women working there are 
   abused, beaten and raped and brutal head guard Burgos (Cliff Osmond) 
   takes an instant dislike to Sugar. The women work long, hard days 
   next to the male prisoners, the only difference being the men are 
   shackled and the women are not. The owner of the camp, Dr. John 
   (Angus Duncan), attempts to get Sugar in bed, but she turns him down, 
   which pisses him off. It turns out Dr. John is an 
   &quot;ethnopharmacologist&quot; (someone who studies the drugs used 
   by primitive people) and he is using the women in the camp as guinea 
   pigs, injecting them with fertility drugs to test them for frigidity. 
   He injects Sugar with the fertility drug and she reaches orgasm 
   almost immediately, overloading the doctor's instrumentation and 
   causing it to explode! It's apparent that Dr. John is nothing more 
   than a raving loon, raping and murdering as he sees fit. After a 
   short period of time, Sugar becomes the the unofficial leader of the 
   female workers, looking after some of the more vunerable women, 
   including seventeen year-old Dolores (Pamela Collins), who <A HREF="sweet_sugar_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sweet sugar poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="153" HEIGHT="226" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>was

   Edwards) falls in love with Mojo (Timothy Brown), a male prisoner and 
   voodoo priest, while Sugar makes time with nice young guard Carlos 
   (Darl Severns). When Dr. John catches Sugar and Carlos making love in 
   his bed, he has Sugar tied up spread-eagle in the middle of the camp 
   and Burgos forces Carlos to whip her. When Carlos whips Burgos 
   instead, Burgos unloads a .45 clip into Carlos, killing him. Burgos 
   then shoves the hot barrel of the gun down the front of Sugar's 
   cut-offs (He says to her, &quot;You like it hot?&quot;). When Sugar 
   tries to escape, Dr. John punishes all the women by throwing them in 
   a room with dozens of cats injected with a serum to make them feral. 
   When Sugar, Simone and Mojo find the graves of former camp workers 
   that Dr. John killed in his experiments, Mojo is burned alive (like a 
   witch) by Dr. John and Burgos in retribution. Sugar, Simone and all 
   the women revolt, setting fire to the sugar cane fields, grabbing 
   some guns and giving the bad guys everything they deserve. Not 
   everyone makes it out alive, however.&nbsp; This classic WIP flick 
   treads the fine line between brutality and comedy and, while it 
   doesn't always succeed, it sure is entertaining. Case in point: When 
   Sugar attempts to escape from the camp in the middle of the night, 
   she runs into a mountain lion. Instead of being torn apart and 
   mauled, Sugar sweet-talks the lion (&quot;Hey good-looking....!&quot;)
    and the lion falls for it! Most of the comedy in this film comes 
   from the interaction between bumbling guards Rick (James Houghton, 
   who became an Emmy Award-winning soap opera writer!) and Max (Albert

   - 1970), as Max continually tries to get the inexperienced Rick laid, 
   with disasterous results. The film also contains elements of the 
   occult, as Mojo uses voodoo on Sugar to locate the mass graves of 
   former female workers. While there is a lot of nudity on view (Ms. 
   Davis looks mighty fine here), the violence is kept to a minimum 
   until the finale, where Cliff Osmond (who would next appear in <B><A HREF="#Invasion Of The Bee">INVASION
    OF THE BEE GIRLS</A></B> - 1973) gets his fingers lopped off and 
   then gets run-through with a machete. The film's highlight is Sugar's 
   whipping and subsequent torture by Burgos with the barrel of a gun.

    MASSACRE</A><A NAME="SwingersMassacre"></A> (1975) -</B> Here's a 
   weird little sexploitation thriller from the swinging 70's. Charlie 
   Tishman (Eastman Price) is a successful lawyer who is getting tired 
   of only making love to his wife Amy (Jan Mitchell), so when a client 
   suggests he and his wife go to a swingers club, the idea intrigues 
   him. Problem is, Charlie has to get Amy to agree to go, which will 
   not be easy. Amy is not too keen on the idea (She says to Charlie, 
   &quot;You have the seven year itch and we've been married ten 
   years!&quot;), but Charlie keeps working on her (even going as far as 
   to prematurely ejaculate when they have sex so she's left 
   unsatisfied!) until she eventually relents and agrees to go. Once at 
   the swingers club, Amy at first acts like a cold fish until they meet 
   Rod (Paul Oberon) and Marge (Mickie Nader), a swinging couple who 
   invite Charlie and Amy over to their house for one of their frequent 
   partner-swapping parties (Charlie is impressed because their 
   invitation is printed instead of hand-written!). Amy is still 
   reluctant when they show up at the party, but a couple of stiff 
   vodkas and Amy joins the other women, Marge, Donna (Ann Perry), Diane 
   (Rene Bond) and Irene (Marsha Jordan) as they change into lingerie 
   and pick partners. A funny thing happens, as Amy get<A HREF="swingers_massacre_1975.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/swingers massacre vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="264" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>s
    turned-on making it with all the men, including Rod, Jerry (Philip 
   Luther), Bill (Ron Darby) and Jim (Gary Kent), but Charlie is unable 
   to &quot;get it up&quot; and make love to any of the women. As Amy 
   screws all the men, Charlie gets drunk, becomes disillusioned with 
   the swinging lifestyle and gets into a big fight with Amy on the 
   drive home (Charlie says, &quot;You need an army! No wonder I can't 
   keep you satisfied!&quot;). Charlie begins to go slowly insane with 
   jealousy and when Bill calls him the following week to invite him 
   over for a poker game and mentions that Amy's &quot;the best fuck we 
   ever had&quot;, Charlie snaps. He stakes out the poker game and 
   follows Jim home. He knocks out Jim, puts him in his car, runs a hose 
   from the tailpipe to the car's window and watches as Jim chokes to 
   death from carbon monoxide poisoning (while Jim pleads, &quot;I 
   didn't mean it Charlie!&quot;). He next kills Rod in the same manner 
   (The police at first think both their deaths was a gay suicide 
   pact!). Charlie then grabs a sniper rifle and kills Bill as he gets 
   in his car. When Charlie and Amy go to Jerry and Donna's house for 
   drinks, Amy and Donna have lesbian sex (after a three-way with 
   Jerry), while Charlie gets drunk and homicidal. Charlie drugs all 
   their drinks and then strangles Jerry and hangs Donna. As the police 
   close in and Amy is made aware of her husband's murderous habits, 
   Charlie goes totally bonkers and tries to kill Amy (He screams, 
   &quot;I did it all for you!&quot;). Amy fights back and kills Charlie 
   with a revolver and the film ends just as it began: With an abused 
   wife killing her husband in self defense. Only this time, Charlie 
   won't be able to represent her in court and get her off with a slap 
   on the wrist like he did with the woman in the beginning of the film. 
   Life is funny, isn't it?&nbsp; Leave it to director/producer Ron 
   Garcia (billed here as &quot;Ronald V. Garcia&quot;) to show a dark 
   side (and a pitch-black one at that) to the swinging lifestyle. 
   Garcia, who also directed the weird sci-fi nudie <B><A HREF="harry novak.htm#Toy Box">THE
    TOY BOX</A></B> (1970 - also starring Rene Bond) and is an 
   award-winning cinematographer (TV's <B><A HREF="crime_story_tv_series.htm">CRIME
    STORY</A></B> and <B><A HREF="twin_peaks_tv_series.htm">TWIN PEAKS</A></B>),
    builds suspense slowly, at first showing us plenty of naked female 
   flesh before showing us the consequences of wife swapping. Charlie 
   has really no one to blame but himself, because Amy wanted nothing to 
   do with swinging but, once she got a taste, there was no turning 
   back. Charlie, who wanted so desperately to be part of the lifestyle, 
   only to find himself unable to perform, creates a Frankenstein's 
   monster in Amy, at least in his own mind. And, just like 
   Frankenstein's monster, Charlie is unable to control Amy's new-found 
   desires. The screenplay (by Helene Arthur) is nothing but a &quot;be 
   careful what you wish for&quot; scenario, spiced-up with male and 
   female nudity (Swinging was a hot topic at the time and was used as a 
   plot device in many hardcore and softcore features in the 70's). The 
   violence is not very graphic (the sniper shooting is the bloodiest), 
   but Eastman Price, as Charlie, makes a brooding and effective villian 
   and his mental breakdown is fairly good for such a low-budget flick.

    advances, Tom drowns Marie in her pool and poses her topless body on 
   a deck chair. Tom also seriously injures Zitto (Zitto Karzann), the 
   Swing A Ling's owner, when he stops by to check up on Marie. To keep 
   Zitto from identifying him, Tom sneaks into his hospital room and 
   injects a hypo full of air into Zitto's neck. Unaware that Tom is the 
   killer, the rest of the club's employees gather together and devise a 
   plan to trap the psycho. The plan backfires when Tom strangles Susie 
   a day before the plan is to go into effect. For her safety, Tom 
   volunteers to bring Jenny to her parent's house, but it turns out to 
   be anything but safe. Harry finally uncovers the truth and rushes to 
   Jenny's parent's house. When Harry and the police arrive, Tom grabs a 
   shotgun, kills a couple of cops (as well as Jenny's father), grabs 
   Jenny and they take off on his motorcycle. Harry saves the day when 
   he pumps all the shells that are in his shotgun into Tom's chest 
   until he looks like a bloody piece of Swiss cheese.&nbsp; This 
   mid-70's sexploitationer, directed by Gus Trikonis (<B><A HREF="student_body_1976.htm">THE
    STUDENT BODY</A></B> - 1976; <B><A HREF="moonshine_county_express_1977.htm">MOONSHINE

    EVIL</A></B> - 1977; <B><A HREF="jungle_heat_1983.htm">JUNGLE HEAT</A></B> 
   - 1983), is a little-seen sex thriller that lacks bloody violence 
   (until the finale), but doesn't skimp on the sex or the sleaze. 
   Although Tom's motives for the killings are unclear, it seems some 
   keywords set him off, such as &quot;Sonny&quot;, &quot;funny&quot; 
   (Marie calls him that and his personality changes in a split second) 
   or &quot;faggot&quot; (which Susie calls the killer when the club's 
   devise the plan to capture him, unaware that Tom is the 
   &quot;faggot&quot;). All the women take their tops off, though much 
   of it is not erotic or titillating at all since Tom manages to rip 
   their clothes off while he is murdering them. The most imaginative 
   kill is Marie's, as the camera bobs below the surface of the pool's 
   water and back up again, mimicking Marie's last gasps for breath. 
   There's not much to the acting here, but that's not to say anyone is 
   bad (although Zitto Karzann is a much better bar owner than he is an 
   actor and I'm willing to bet that's exactly what he was in real 
   life). Bruce Watson (This is his biggest role, as he was usually just 
   a bit player in movies and TV) takes top honors as Tom, who can 
   switch from happiness to madness at the tip of a hat, but the rest of 
   the cast, including William Smith (<B><A HREF="#HollywoodMan">HOLLYWOOD

    on DVD. This is perhaps director Roberta Findlay's most sought-after 
   film, due to it's frequent use of repellent violence and MPAA-issued 
   X rating on it's initial release. When the occupants of a dilapidated 
   tenement building call the cops on a drug-taking gang, led by the 
   sunglass-wearing Chaco (Enrique Sandino),<A HREF="tenement_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/tenement dvd front small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="175" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   who are illegally living in the basement, the gang gets taken away 
   only to be released on a technicality. They come back to the building 
   swearing revenge and they keep their promise. They kill a blind man's 
   seeing-eye dog, rape a black woman with a broomstick and then kill 
   her after she rams a pair of scissors into one of the gangs eye. The 
   rest of the tenants band together and try to fight back as the gang 
   moves floor-by-floor destroying the apartments along the way. The 
   only hero in the bunch is Sam Washington (Joe Lynn), an electrician 
   who leads the group of survivors and comes up with some boobytraps of 
   his own. As the night progresses, both sides take casualties as one 
   gang member shoots up rat poison (thinking it is heroin), one tenant 
   (Dan Snow) gets stabbed in the stomach, a john (Felix Rivera) gets 
   run-through with a pipe, the female gang member (Karen Russell) has a 
   refrigerator dropped on her, another female tenant has her throat cut 
   with a straight razor and another gang member is electrocuted. The 
   whole film is basically just a way to show different ways to kill 
   someone and the blood flows rather freely and graphically. The only 
   actor of any notice is Paul Calderon (<B><A HREF="pulp_fiction_1995.htm">PULP
    FICTION</A></B> - 1995), who has been on TV's <B><A HREF="law_order_tv_series.htm">LAW
    &amp; ORDER</A></B> as a guest star playing different roles more 
   than any other actor in memory. He's good here as Chaco's cackling 
   right-hand man Hector, who glees in impaling, raping and stabbing 
   everyone in sight, before getting his comeuppance during the finale. 
   While technically this film looks very cheap (it was), it still holds 
   your attention due to the constant graphic violence, blood and nudity 
   (sometimes all at the same time). It also has a title song that just 
   will not leave your head long after the film is over. The ending 
   involving a pregnant woman and Chaco on the roof of the building is 
   also gripping and satisfying. The DVD also contains an interview with 
   director Findlay, who has had a long and distinguished career in the 
   exploitation field. She has some amusing anecdotes to tell about this 
   film, including one about a drunken assistant cameraman with a bowel 
   problem, all told in her thick Bronx accent. While she hasn't made a 
   film since 1989's little-seen <B><A HREF="banned_1989.htm">BANNED</A></B>,
    she has held up very well and someone should give her some money to 
   make another film. <B>TENEMENT</B>, also known as <B>SLAUGHTER IN THE 
   SOUTH BRONX</B>, also stars Olivia Ward (whose husband was Police 
   Commissioner of New York City at the time), Jorge Baqueiro, Walter

   Here's an early 80's sexploitationer combined with some slasher 
   elements. Sexy college professor Diane Stevens (Sybil Danning; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#PhantomEmpire1987">THE

   (Eric Brown; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Video Murders">VIDEO MURDERS</A></B> 
   - 1988) to varnish her yacht, but it soon becomes apparent that Diane 
   wants more from Jay than just a revarnishing. After parading around 
   in a teenie bikini and seducing Jay with her naked body, Diane talks 
   Jay into breaking into the mansion of her husband Michael's (Andrew 
   Prine; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Centerfold Girls">THE

    and chases him away. A few minutes later, an unknown person wearing 
   white sneakers and black leather gloves grabs the rifle and shoots 
   both Lillian and Lettie in the head. When Jay reports back to Diane 
   and Michael, they drive to Lillian's house to see if Mom and Grandma 
   were effectively scared, only to find the house empty, but Michael 
   finds signs of foul play and accuses Jay of murder. The question soon 
   becomes: Are Michael and Diane setting-up Jay to take the fall for 
   murder or is there another killer in their midst? Jay swears he will 
   uncover the truth, but his jealous ex-girlfriend Cynthia (Beth 
   Shaffel) has compromising photos of Jay with Diane that could spell 
   doom for everyone. Jay searches the yacht and finds a pair of bloody 
   sneakers and some documents about a mental institution in 
   Switzerland. As Jay investigates further (he still continues boning 
   Diane), the killer tries to murder him, but is unsuccessful. Cynthia 
   shows up at the mansion to give the incriminating photos to Michael, 
   but when she enters the house and discovers a child's playroom 
   upstairs, someone dressed as Santa Claus (!) bashes her head in with 
   a baseball bat. When Michael ends up stabbed to death while watching 
   Jay and Diane making love, it becomes apparent that the killer is 
   someone close to Jay that has secret ties to the Stevens family. The 
   attic in the mansion holds the clues to the killer's identity, but 
   will Jay and Diane survive the night after discovering the 
   truth?&nbsp; This is a fairly easy-to-solve murder mystery, but

    M.J. walks out of the courtroom, he says to Cullen, &quot;Your 
   sister wasn't half-bad!&quot; and then shoves an ice cream cone in 
   Cullen's face and punches him in the stomach in the parking lot in 
   front of Cullen's girlfriend Tracy (Polly King). From that point on, 
   Cullen puts away his law books and sets out to get revenge for his 
   sister's death. First up is gang member Johnny (Daniel Schweitzer), 
   who Cullen traps in a bus station bathroom, shoves his face in a 
   toilet and tells him to keep looking over his shoulder, because he 
   won't see his death coming. Johnny tells what happened to M.J., who 
   laughs it off. While Johnny is with his girlfriend (Melisande 
   Conaway), who washes Johnny's penis because it is infected (!), his 
   phone rings and it's Cullen at the other end, who tells Johnny that 
   his time is up. Johnny calls M.J., who tells him to stay in his house 
   until he gets there. Johnny doesn't listen and makes a beeline to his 
   car after receiving another phone call from Cullen, only to be 
   shotgunned in the stomach by Cullen as he opens the car door. Cullen 
   then goes after gang member Billy (Jim Curry), whom he stabs in the 
   hand with a knife and then is about to shoot him, when M.J. and Curly 
   (Sam Moree) enter Billy's home. M.J. accidentally shoots Billy in the 
   back, killing him (he doesn't seem too broken up about it), when he 
   tries to shoot Cullen, but Cullen gets away. Detective Garrett and 
   his brother find Cullen's knife at Billy's house and cover it up (The 
   Police Chief says they will do &quot;Something we can live with.&quot;
    when they don't turn over the knife to the other detectives). They 
   grab Tracy for her own safety, while Cullen follows M.J. and Curly to 
   a seedy motel, where they hole-up with a couple of chicks (M.J. finds 
   his girl too ugly to have sex with!). When M.J. goes outside to get 
   some ice, he notices Cullen hiding behind a corner of the motel. M.J. 
   comes up with a quick plan. He goes back to his room., tells Curly to 
   go outside, locks the door and hops out the back window, hoping to 
   kill Cullen while he shoots it out with Curly. Cullen kills Curly 
   with his six-shooter and M.J. misses his opportunity to murder 
   Cullen, which leads to a shoot-out/chase on the beach (where neither 
   of their guns seem to run out of bullets!). Detective Garrett and 
   Tracy spot the shootout and Tracy goes to run towards Cullen, but 
   M.J. takes a shot at her and she falls down. Cullen shoots M.J. in 
   the stomach, killing him and then rushes to Tracy's side. Turns out 
   that Tracy wasn't shot at all, she just fell down! Detective Garrett 
   and the Police Chief grab Cullen's pistol and everyone lives happily 
   ever after.&nbsp; This mid-70's slice of sleaze (released 
   theatrically by Dimension Pictures) contains plenty of nudity and 
   scenes of rape (but nothing too explicit; just panties being torn off 
   and the gang, with their pants on, humping for a few frames), but the 
   violence is rather mild. There is some blood, but we are shown the 
   gunshots after the fact, except for Johnny's death; he's shot in slow 
   motion and flies through the air. While nothing spectacular (the 
   sound is especially bad, as some of the dialogue recorded outside is 
   muffled by background noise), this film (which has the title <B><A HREF="getting_even_1976.htm">GETTING

    job, where she has to assassinate three very bad people before she 
   will get paid. She dons various disguises (including a black maid!) 
   to get close to her targets and kills them in various unique ways 
   (She paralyzes one guy in his hot tub by poisoning the water with an 
   ancient Chinese potion and watches him drown), while fighting off 
   enemies who want to see her dead. As Samantha gets closer to 
   completing her contract, Domingo introduces himself to her at a 
   cocktail party and they find themselves intellectual rivals and, 
   eventually, lovers. They both know that the relationship will never 
   last, but they make the best of the time they share together. 
   Samantha kills the second person on her contract, a female white 
   slaver, and Domingo finds himself protecting the very people who may 
   be Samantha's final hit on the contract. Things go from bad to worse 
   when Samantha accidentally (?) kills Sanchez, makes her final hit and 
   leaves Domingo tied-up on her yacht while a timebomb ticks away 
   nearby. Did Samantha leave Domingo enough time to undo the Chinese 
   knots on his ropes and escape from the yacht before it explodes? His 
   fate is left to the viewer's imagination.&nbsp; This 70's 
   sexploitationer, which pushes it's R-rating into hard territory due 
   to nudity and sex and contains equal measures of sexploitation 
   elements and action set-pieces, was directed by Don Schain, whose 
   short directorial career includes the three <B>GINGER</B> films and 
   the dated political racial prejudice flick <B><A HREF="#PlaceCalledToday">A
    PLACE CALLED TODAY</A></B> (1972). This is the last directorial 
   credit for Schain (who would eventually work for the Disney Channel, 
   where he was responsible for producing the hugely popular <B><A HREF="high_school_musical_2006.htm">HIGH
    SCHOOL MUSICAL</A></B> series of films) and the last acting credit 
   for Cheri Caffaro (<B><A HREF="#Savage Sisters">SAVAGE SISTERS</A></B> 
   - 1974; She also scripted the sexploitationer <B><A HREF="hots_1979.htm">H.O.T.S.</A></B>

    DEMONS OF LUDLOW</A></B> [1983] before disappearing into obscurity), 
   who spends most of her screen time topless or completely nude (Schain 
   and Caffaro were once married to each other for a short period of 
   time). It's a good thing, too, because she's a terrible actress and 
   an even worse martial artist (there's a fight on her yacht with a 
   Filipino cop that's the epitome of ineptitude, especially when they 
   both find wooden chaku sticks that just happen to be lying around on 
   the deck and fight each other in one of the funniest choreographed 
   fights committed to celluloid [you can actually see Caffaro mouthing 
   &quot;Left, right, up, down&quot; as they swing their chaku sticks at 
   each other!]). Actor Aharon Impale is not much better in any 
   department, either, as his martial arts skills are also highly 
   suspect as is his command of the English language. He has since gone 
   on to make a name for himself as a fine character actor in films and 
   on TV, usually portraying Middle Eastern bad guys, military personnel 
   or politicians. <B><A HREF="too_hot_to_handle_1976c.htm">TOO HOT TO HANDLE</A></B> 
   is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess that contains some nice 
   Philippines location photography, lots of nudity and Vic Diaz (always 
   an entertaining proposition!). Producer Ralph T. Desiderio (who also

   and many others). You either love him or hate him. I happen to love 
   him (well, most of his films) because, even though his films were 
   dialogue-heavy (which turns off a lot of people), if you listen to 
   what the people are actually saying, you will get an idea the 
   torturous life that Milligan lived (and, believe me, it wasn't 
   pretty). Even though the title of this period film is somewhat 
   misleading, it still is one of Milligan's bloodiest films. It begins 
   with the ruler of some centuries-old kingdom (probably England, but 
   it never says so) cutting a rose from a bush and then a black-hooded 
   executioner sneaks up behind him and chops off his head with a 
   medieval axe. We then see his funeral procession at a beach (where 
   anachronisms abound, including a<A HREF="torture_dungeon_1970.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bloodthirsty butchers-torture dungeon ad mat9 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="214" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   modern-day buoy in the water), where mentally deficient pallbearer 
   Albert, Duke of Aberthy (Milligan regular Hal Borske), who is next in 
   line to become King, is seen continuously picking his nose and 
   looking at his boogers! The unnamed sister of the dead King blames 
   her half-brother, Norman, Duke Of Norwich (Jerremy Brooks; that's the 
   way it is spelled in the opening credits) for her brother's death. 
   She confides in her also unnamed female servant that she was in love 
   with her brother and is pregnant with his child. She swears that one 
   day she will get even with Norman, proclaiming, &quot;From now on, 
   revenge is my lover!&quot; Norman and his sidekick, Ivan the 
   Hunchback (Richard Mason), conspire with the Council to eventually 
   get rid of the people next in line for ruler, which is in this order: 
   Albert, Lady Agatha (Donna Whitfield) and Lady Jane (Patrician 
   Dillon), all brothers and sisters of the dead King who hate Norman 
   (Well, Albert is incapable of hating anyone, since it is obvious he 
   is mentally retarded). Being that Norman was only the King's 
   half-brother and is not 100% royal blood (his mother was a prostitute 
   who got knocked up by his half-brother's father), he is considered 
   not fit to be a ruler, but since it is the Council that actually runs 
   the kingdom (the King is nothing but a figurehead that does the 
   Council's bidding), Norman can rule the kingdom by proxy. Peter the 
   Eye (Neil Flanagan, who was the titled <B><A HREF="guru_the_mad_monk_1972.htm">GURU
    THE MAD MONK</A></B> - 1970, another Milligan film), the 
   eyepatch-wearing head of the Council, reminds Norman that in order 
   for this plan to work, Albert must get married to a plague-free bride 
   (the Bubonic Plague has wiped-out nearly half of the kingdom's 
   population) so he can produce a male heir, which Norman and the 
   Council will use as a puppet to do their evil biddings. They all vote 
   that nineteen year-old Heather MacGregor (Susan Cassidy) will be 
   Albert's bride. The problem is, Heather is in love with peasant 
   William (Dan Tyra), as we watch them frolicking nude in a stream and 
   then making love (this film has a lot of female nudity in it, which 
   runs opposite to Milligan's real-life homosexuality, but there are 
   also a lot of naked male asses in this film, too). Heather's father, 
   Mr. MacGregor (Robert Fucillo), who was forced to sell his daughter 
   to the Council for thirty pieces of gold,&nbsp; and family friend 
   Margaret, the one-eyed hag (Maggie Rogers), assure Heather that the 
   arranged marriage will be beneficial to her, as she will never go 
   hungry again and she will now have the title &quot;Lady Heather&quot;.
    Heather's father has a bout of guilty conscience and arranges for 
   his daughter to escape the kingdom, but first Heather must try to get 
   William to believe she doesn't love him anymore (it doesn't work). 
   William and Heather decide to escape together, but two hood-wearing 
   executioners nail William's hands to the side of a barn, impale his 
   chest with a pitchfork (a Milligan trademark) and disembowel him with 
   a knife (this happens right after Ivan and the loincloth-wearing 
   Marvin [George Box], a long-time friend of Heather's, have a 
   homoerotic wrestling match and Ivan whispers something into his ear). 
   With William dead, Heather has no choice but to become halfwit 
   Albert's bride. But before that happens, Lady Agatha and Lady Jane 
   warn her of Norman's plan, even going as far as to show her Norman's 
   torture dungeon, where we see various victims missing tongues, eyes, 
   lips and legs (one of Milligan's most ambitious and effective scenes 
   in any of his films, but this is the only time that we see the 
   torture dungeon in the entire film). It seems that Norman has bouts 
   of unexplained &quot;fits&quot; (it could be epilepsy) and when he 
   does, he likes to hurt people and take them to his dungeon for some 
   torture sessions, including Agatha's and Jane's male servants 
   (There's a scene in the film where Norman has one of his 
   &quot;fits&quot; when a snake bites Ivan on his hump. Norman cuts the 
   hump open with a dagger and forces a servant to suck out the 
   poison!). We then cut to a scene where Rosemary (Patricia Garvey) 
   catches Ivan in Norman's bed and Norman quite frankly says, &quot;I'll
    try anything. I'm not a homosexual. I'm not a heterosexual. I'm not 
   asexual. I'm trisexual. I'll try anything for pleasure.&quot; He then 
   makes love to Rosemary. Heather marries retard Albert (he doesn't 
   even know how to kiss the bride when the priest announces &quot;I now 
   pronounce you man and wife.&quot;) and when it come to the honeymoon 
   night, Albert is more interested in eating chicken than having sex, 
   so Norman has to show him how to do it step-by-step (we then learn 
   that Albert was &quot;mysteriously&quot; dropped on his head when he 
   was six years-old). When the deed is done, Heather leaves the room 
   when Albert falls asleep, but the two hooded executioners enter the 
   bedroom and hammer a wooden stake into Albert's heart. Norman 
   celebrates Albert's death by having a m&eacute;nage a trois with Ivan 
   and Rosemary, but first he makes Ivan tell Rosemary his life story 
   (it's quite funny in its awfulness) and Rosemary has to tell her life 
   story to Ivan (it's not pretty) so they become friends before they do 
   it (Norman says, &quot;Just one big happy family!&quot;). Lady Agatha 
   informs Heather of Albert's death and helps her escape the kingdom. 
   Norman stabs Agatha in her stomach with his dagger when he discovers 
   what she has done. Lady Jane hides out with Mr. MacGregor and the 
   one-eyed Margaret, but when she tries to escape the kingdom on 
   horseback, one of the hooded executioners kills her and dumps her 
   body in a stream. Norman decides to kill Heather (I guess using her 
   baby a a puppet is being dropped), as we then learn that Heather's 
   lifelong friend Marvin is one of the hooded executioners. He chases 
   Heather, knocks her out, puts her on a horse and takes her to a barn, 
   where he plans on killing her with an axe, but his love for her stops 
   him from doing it. Discovering that Heather is still alive, Ivan 
   stabs Marvin in the stomach with an iron spike, but Marvin manages to 
   impale Ivan's hump with a pitchfork before they both die. Heather 
   then tries to escape on a horse (it is tied to a post, so all she 
   does is ride around in a circle!), but Norman shows up swinging a 
   big-ass chain. Before Norman can kill Heather with the chain, 
   Margaret shows up and throws a spear, which impales Norman through 
   his torso, but Margaret is trampled by a horse in the process. Before 
   Margaret dies, we then learn that she was the unnamed sister we saw 
   in the beginning of the film. The baby she was carrying was actually 
   Heather and Margaret became disfigured when Norman tried to burn down 
   the church she was hiding in nearly twenty years earlier (I know, the 
   timeline in this film makes no sense at all.). Heather is actually 
   Mr. MacGregor's adopted daughter and Margaret has finally seen her 
   plan of revenge come to fruition before she dies. Heather is now 
   ruler of the kingdom and the Council has no chance in Hell of using 
   her as a puppet.&nbsp; Even though this film has all the trademarks 
   of a cheap Andy Milligan <A HREF="torture_dungeon_1970_blu-ray.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/torture dungeon blu-ray front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="231" HEIGHT="264" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>film
    (it was filmed in Staten Island on 16mm short ends of film stock for 
   less than $10,000 and blown up to 35mm for theatrical showings by 
   Milligan's longtime producer, the legendary cheapskate William 
   Mishkin), including library music, his patented swirling camera 
   movements and just barely acceptable acting (some of the smaller 
   parts were people Milligan pulled off the streets of Staten Island 
   for no pay and their Staten Island accents and horrible line readings 
   are very apparent). The 1.78:1 widescreen <A HREF="torture_dungeon_1970_blu-ray.htm">Blu-Ray</A>,
    released by William Olsen and his company <A HREF="http://www.codereddvd.com">Code
    Red</A>, is so pristine and colorful, we can see all the cheap 
   makeup effects for the first time at home as clearly as they could 
   ever have been seen. I don't remember this film being so sharp even 
   when I saw it in theaters back in the early-70's. The print is a 
   marvel to look at and makes the film all the more enjoyable to watch. 
   There is more than enough blood and gore on view to satisfy those 
   interested in early-70's exploitation films (much more than most of 
   Milligans other films) and it is nice that Code Red found a print 
   that is mostly uncut (thanks to licensing it and other Milligan films 
   from the legimate rights holder, Films Around The World), as most 
   other previous versions (on fullscreen <A HREF="torture_dungeon_1970_midnight_video_vhs.htm">VHS</A> 
   from <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Miscellaneous">Midnight Video</A> 
   and <A HREF="something_weird_ads_1990-2014.htm">Something Weird Video</A>)
    were missing some of the more gorier bits, including later 
   theatrical releases on the bottom half of double bills. The 
   screenplay, by jack-of-all-trades Milligan (who photographed, edited, 
   sound recorded and designed the period costumes) and John Borske 
   (brother of Hal Borske), is quite involved (and has many instances of 
   sexual identity, some overt, some hidden), but somewhere, nearly 
   twenty years passed and no one aged, which is a real cheat to the 
   audience. Still, this is one of Milligan's films that even non-fans 
   of Milligan can enjoy, thanks to the frequent gore, nudity and the 
   beautiful print. If you really want to learn about Andy Milligan's 
   incredibly sad life, I would recommend that you try to find author 
   Jimmy McDonough's biography of Milligan, titled &quot;<A HREF="ghastly_one_the_sex_gore_netherworld.htm">THE
    GHASTLY ONE: THE SEX-GORE NETHERWORLD OF FILMMAKER ANDY MILLIGAN</A>&quot;.
    It will make you appreciated the films of Milligan much more than 
   you do now. Code Red also released Milligan's <B><A HREF="bloodthirsty_butchers_1970_blu-ray.htm">BLOODTHIRSTY
    BUTCHERS</A></B> (1970) and <B><A HREF="man_with_two_heads_1972_blu-ray.htm">THE
    MAN WITH 2 HEADS</A></B> (1972) on Blu-Ray, something I thought I 
   would never see in my lifetime. Look for reviews of them on this site 
   soon. I applaud Code Red for taking chances like this because most 
   other companies would not take the care needed to properly restore 
   these films (Just look at <A HREF="http://www.retromedia.org">Retromedia
    Entertainment</A>'s DVD titled <B><A HREF="andy_milligan_grindhouse_experience_dvd.htm">THE
    ANDY MILLIGAN GRINDHOUSE EXPERIENCE</A></B>, which crams three of 
   Milligan's films onto one disc.). William Olsen has gone on record 
   saying that he rescued these prints used on the Blu-Rays just before 
   they turned to vinegar (using the Frankenstein technique of taking 
   the best parts of various reels from different prints to make one 
   cohesive film), but he must have put a lot of work into them to make 
   them look this good. Find these if you can. They are worth every 
   penny if you are an Andy Milligan fan. Also starring Helen Adams and 
   Matt Baylor. A Code Red Blu-Ray Release. <B>Rated R</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

   next gas station, where schoolgirls Julie (Cathy Worthington) and Pam 
   (Susan Russell) flirt with Jay, while Pete and a morose Al hang out 
   by the 7-Up machine and watch the action (Teacher Miss Tenny doesn't 
   seem too concerned at all, but bus driver Marvin acts like he's the 
   girls' unofficial guardian, refusing to answer Jay's questions about 
   where they are coming from or going to and making sure all the girls 
   are on the bus once it is filled-up with gas). After the bus leaves 
   the station, Al gets into a confrontation with the gas station 
   attendant when he accidentally (?) spills gas on Al's gas tank. Al 
   then kills the attendant (out of eyeshot of Pete and Jay) by lowering 
   a jacked-up car on him and the trio then take off to catch up with 
   the bus, which has conveniently broken down on the side of the road, 
   &quot;smack-dab in the middle of nowhere&quot;. Slut Bobbie (Dina 
   Ousley) and virginal Pam get into a catfight when Pam calls her a 
   bitch, just as the three bikers arrive on the scene. While Pete tries 
   to fix the bus, Jay and Julie flirt with each other some more and Al 
   zeroes-in on Bobbie. When it is discovered that the bus' fuel pump is 
   shot, Jay, Pete and Al tow the bus with their bikes until they come 
   to a deserted farmhouse. Now the real &quot;fun&quot; begins. Al 
   kills Marvin by running him over with his bike (breaking his neck), 
   so Al decides that no one will get out alive. Al and Pete tie-up Jay 
   and Al rapes Miss Tenny, while Bobbie, Pam and Tina (Jill Voight) 
   keep Pete sexually entertained so Julie can untie Jay and let him 
   escape on his bike. Jay dies when Pete runs his bike over a cliff. Al 
   kills Tina (by suffocating her face-first in the sand) when she tries 
   to escape and then Al rapes Bobbie, forcing everyone to watch. Turns 
   out Jay didn't die after all (he was playing possum) and he returns 
   to the farmhouse, hangs Pete with a piece of rope and gets into a 
   fight with Al. It all ends when Miss Tenny impales Al in his back 
   with a metal spike. Today's lesson: Don't fuck with the teacher!&nbsp;
    This is a pretty boring exploitation flick for 75% of its running 
   time. Director/producer/screenwriter Earl Barton (a former 50's bit 
   actor and dance choreographer; this is his only directorial effort) 
   slow burns this film so much, it's like trying to light a 
   tightly-wrapped joint and getting a good hit. It doesn't help that 
   Zalman King gives such a lethargic performance; he looks and acts 
   like he is sleepwalking through much of the film. The only time his 
   acting comes to life is when he is ripping-off the clothes, raping or 
   killing the young girls (and teacher Miss Tenny), which may be why 
   King basically gave up acting to become a 
   director/producer/screenwriter of arty, well-made erotic films and 
   cable TV series, including Showtime's <B><A HREF="red_shoes_diaries_tv_series_1992-1996.htm">THE

   nudity and violence not allowed on TV at the time tossed into the 
   mix, but the problem is there's not enough nudity or violence to make 
   this film the sleaze classic it wants to be. Zalman King (who passed

    STOP WOMEN</A><A NAME="TruckStopWomen"></A> (1974) -</B> This is 
   70's exploitation at it's finest. Anna (Lieux Dressler; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#KingdomSpiders1977">KINGDOM
    OF THE SPIDERS</A></B> - 1977) runs a truck stop in New Mexico 
   that's a front for prostitution and stolen truck rackets. Anna has 
   cameras installed in every room of her motel, where she watches and 
   listens to truckers screw and talk to her girls, picking up tidbits 
   of information of expensive loads the truckers are hauling. She then 
   sends daughter Rose (Claudia Jennings; <B><A HREF="gator_bait_1974.htm">GATOR
    BAIT</A></B> - 1974) and hooker Tina (Jennifer Burton; <B><A HREF="invisible_strangler_1977.htm">INVISIBLE
    STRANGLER</A></B> - 1977) to go out and hijack the trucks, 
   pretending to be two stranded girls on the highway. Anna runs into 
   trouble when Mob guy Smith (John Martino) is sent by his East Coast 
   associates to put her out of business, even though she has backing 
   from the West Coast Mafia. When Smith tries to hijack a load of 
   already stolen color TVs from Anna's truck stop, Anna's employees 
   Curly (Dennis Fimple), Mac (Gene Drew) and Winter (Len Lesser) stop 
   him and send Smith and his goon <A HREF="truck_stop_women_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/truck stop women poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Rusty
    (Speed Sterns, also the film's Stunt Coordinator) packing. Trouble 
   ensues when Rose turns traitorous and sides with Smith, even sleeping 
   with him. When Anna learns that her West Coast mob boss has been 
   murdered (We see Smith and Rusty gun him and a whore down in a 
   bathtub in the film's first scene), she asks her West Coast 
   connection, Seago (Paul Carr, who plays his role as if he's dying of 
   tuberculosis), for some help. Anna goes to Smith's truck stop and 
   slugs Rose (knocking her out) and she and Mac bring her back home 
   (Rusty tries to stop them, but wrecks one of Smith's trucks in the 
   process). When Winter and another one of Anna's mechanics are 
   murdered by a mystery killer (we only see the ring on his finger), 
   Anna makes a deal with Seago to rip-off some securities hidden in a 
   truck full of cattle in exchange for Seago's help in getting rid of 
   Smith. It is at this time we learn the identity of the mystery killer 
   and Anna, Mac and Curly will have to watch their backs. After pulling 
   off the securities heist and finding a piece of evidence pointing to 
   the guilty party, Anna and her two men devise a plan to bring down 
   Smith and rescue Rose (There's nothing like the sight of women firing 
   machine guns in anger!). The finale in a ghost town has an unexpected 
   twist that I didn't see coming. Better acted than most 70's 
   exploitationers, thanks to a cast of veterans (it's even sadder when 
   you realize that Claudia Jennings, Paul Carr, Dennis Fimple, Len 
   Lesser, Lieux Dressler and Gene Drew are all dead now), this early 
   effort from director/producer/co-scripter Mark L. Lester (<B><A HREF="#ClassOf1984">CLASS

   violence into the mix and doing it with a lot of panache. Lieux 
   Dressler stands out as the tough-as-nails broad who still has a soft 
   spot for her daughter. It's nice to see a woman in charge for a 
   change and Dressler does a remarkable job here, fighting, loving and 
   driving an 18 wheeler just as well as any man. Claudia Jennings (<B><A HREF="gator_bait_1974.htm">GATOR

   (1984) -</B> This sleazy rape/revenge exploitationer opens with Liz 
   Grant (Elizabeth Kaitan) getting raped at a party thrown at mobster 
   Jack Diamond's (D. Balin) home. When Liz reports the rape at the 
   local police station, Detective Kevin McBane (J.C. Quinn) talks (or, 
   rather, shames) her out of filing a report when he hears Jack 
   Diamond's name mentioned. It seems Diamond throws at lot of parties 
   at his house and rape and abuse is a common theme. He gets away with 
   it, too, since the clients at his parties are rich and influential. 
   The latest victim-to-be is 18 year-old soap opera actress Lisa Robb 
   (April Daisy White). She attends one of Diamond's parties and catches 
   the eye of sadistic mobster Frank Lyon (Alec Massey), the same 
   scumbag who raped Liz. After some innocent skinnydipping in the pool, 
   Lisa is later tied to a bed and gang-raped by Diamond and Frank. When 
   she gets home, Lisa's overbearing Aunt Shirley (Kaye Dowd) berates 
   her with an &quot;I told you so!&quot; diatribe and her 13 year-old 
   brother Danny (Jonathan Ward) makes Aunt Shirley call the police when 
   he sees what shape she's in. Detective McBane shows up at the house 
   and questions Lisa, but she refuses to co-operate, although a strange 
   friendship developes between her and McBane. A newspaper reporter 
   latches on to Lisa's story when Aunt Shirley gives him enough 
   information to make it a front page story, pissing off<A HREF="violated_1984.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/violated vestron vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="139" HEIGHT="246" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Frank, who warns Diamond to take care of the problem before the 
   police look too closely into Frank's illegal businesses (including a 
   huge shipment of marijuana sitting on a ship at sea). Thanks to the 
   newspaper story, a Grand Jury is convened and everyone at the party 
   Lisa was at is issued supoenas. Diamond and Frank intimidate the 
   witnesses to lie and Lisa goes to McBane for help. He 
   &quot;unofficially&quot; questions Liz (who is now a high-priced call 
   girl in Diamond's stable) and he and Lisa go snooping around 
   Diamond's party house, where they find a library of videotapes of 
   hidden camera porn and rapes. When McBane finds a tape showing Liz's 
   rape, he has all the proof he needs to nail Diamond and, eventually, 
   Frank, but no one will ever see the tape because it was obtained 
   illegally. At the Grand Jury, everyone lies, saying Lisa was doing 
   drugs and hitting on every man at the party (even showing an 
   out-of-context videotape of her skinnydipping in the pool), making 
   her look like a tramp. Diamond and Frank get off scott-free and Lisa 
   is shamed in public and loses her soap opera gig. She grabs a gun and 
   goes out seeking justice, not aware that McBane has the same idea. No 
   one lives happily ever after.&nbsp; It's really difficult to 
   establish what kind of film one-shot wonder 
   director/producer/co-scripter Richard Cannistraro was going for here 
   (he even has a small acting role in this). On one hand, it's a sleazy 
   rape and nudity-filled exploitationer, where women are naked as much 
   as possible and there are scenes that are uncomfortably intense. 
   While the rapes are hard to watch, the scene that really upset me is 
   when Lisa's 13 year-old brother Danny walks into her bedroom while 
   she is topless and she doesn't even attempt to cover-up. On the 
   contrary, they talk graphically about her tits, his masturbation 
   habits and at one point he hugs her naked torso and says, &quot;If I 
   wasn't your brother!&quot; Yecch! On the other hand, Cannistraro 
   tries to show us how the court system can make anyone look guilty 
   given the right circumstances, especially in cases of rape. Since 
   this was made before Rape Shield Laws were put into effect, this film 
   shows that rape was a fairly easy crime to get away with, since the 
   victim's sexual history could be brought up as evidence of character. 
   Unfortunately, this film has a hard time meshing all the elements 
   together as a cohesive whole and <B><A HREF="violated_1984b.htm">VIOLATED</A></B> 
   fails to entertain. It plays like one of Lisa's soap operas, with 
   very little to recommend besides some full-frontal female nudity (the 
   men keep their pants on, even while raping the women!). John Heard (<B><A HREF="chud_1984.htm">C.H.U.D.</A></B>

   Joseph Lai-produced piece of sleaze that's not his usual 80's-style 
   cut-and-paste stuff. Gang leader Chan Chung (Danny Lee) runs a female 
   slavery ring where he has his gay photographer cohort Ah Kahn (Paul 
   Lee) stage phony photo shoots in order to kidnap the female models 
   and turn them into prostitutes for use around the world. Flamer Ah 
   Kahn hits on a dude in a disco (&quot;You're real sexy, like Charles 
   Bronson!&quot;), not realizing that the guy is Ho King (Bill Lau), a 
   private detective that has just returned from England and is 
   investigation the disappearances of several women. Ho King goes out 
   on a &quot;date&quot; with Ah Kahn, but when Ho asks too many 
   questions about the missing women, he is knocked-out by a couple of 
   thugs and wakes up with his pants pulled down around his ankles, with 
   Ah Kahn whacking his penis over and over with a chopstick! Ho is 
   eventually thrown down a sewer and left to die, but he is rescued a

    a pedestrian who hears his cries for help. We are then taken to the 
   camp where the kidnapped women are &quot;conditioned&quot; for their 
   new lives as whores or indentured servants. Those that try to escape 
   suffer even harder fates: They are either constantly dunked in a 
   river while trapped in bamboo cages, forced to stand out in the hot 
   sun until their skin blisters or put in wooden coffin-like boxes 
   filled with snakes. Tough cookie kidnapee Judi (Eva Bisset) runs her 
   own exclusive clique in the camp and constantly gets into catfights 
   with other captive women, especially new girl Tina (Gigi Bovee), but 
   when Judi's sister dies after being raped (She is taken to the camp 
   doctor, who is told, &quot;She thinks she's in pain down 
   below!&quot;), Judi and Tina join forces and lead a revolt, 
   eventually escaping after much gunfire and death. Judi and Tina go 
   after Chen Chung, Ah Kahn and other members of the Triad, using their 
   womanly charms to lure and kill their prey (one poor guy is hung by 
   his ankles over a bathtub as it fills with water). Ho King is also 
   after the same people; only he is now (incredibly) working for the 
   police. Ho and the girls quickly join forces and begin torturing gang 
   members (another poor guy has firecrackers tied to his penis, which 
   are then lit when he doesn't answer their questions fast enough!) 
   until Chan Chung is shot dead. The question then becomes: Who is Chan 
   Chung's boss? I'm afraid one major character is not going to like the 
   answer.&nbsp; This is a sweaty, depraved Hong Kong 
   sexploitation/action flick full of full-frontal female nudity and 
   scenes of torture and sexual depravity. Single-monikered director 
   Pasan (also known as &quot;Pasha&quot; and &quot;Leung Poeh&quot;) 
   keeps the story moving at a quick clip, even though the screenplay 
   (credited to &quot;Ho Ward Ki&quot;) makes very little sense. 
   Characters are introduced and then quickly forgotten and all logic is 
   thrown out the window to advance the plot (I guess the quickest way 
   to join the Hong Kong Police Department is to get your pecker twacked 
   with a chopstick and then get thrown in a sewer!). This film is full 
   of action and torture sequences, including gunfights, car chases, 
   martial arts fights and lots of snakes. There's not much meat to this 
   film, but you gotta love a flick where, in the finale, a bandaged 
   head-to-toe Ho King pursues another fully bandaged man (the head head 
   bad guy) through the hospital like two mummies, only for Ho to 
   discover that the bad guy is actually his brother, who slits his own 
   throat with a strait razor in front of Ho! What happens to Judi and 
   Tina? Well, I'm afraid that this film can't waste its time with small 
   details like that. Do you expect anything less from Joseph Lai? This 
   is one of those films where, based on the first couple of minutes, 
   you'll instantly know whether it's your cup of tea or not. It had me 
   hooked the moment when Ah Kahn stares at Ho's ass in the disco.

    and, from that point on, Jason and Christine's lives are forever 
   intertwined. Christine explains to Jason why she in on the revenge 
   spree, so the lunk-headed Jason agrees to help her. Not only do they 
   have to avoid the police, they now have to contend with Brusstar, who 
   is mighty pissed-off that Christine shot and killed his best friend 
   Jesus (Luis Contreras) with a bullet to the eye (He doesn't give a 
   rat's ass that his boss is dead, though). Brusstar orders the 
   remaining two goons, Jimmy (James McIntire) and McKee (Wayne 
   Woodson), to find the taxi driver, as it is the most logical way to 
   locate Christine. Jason drives around enforcing and collecting old 
   gambling debts so he can gather enough money together to send 
   Christine out of state. After Jason's best friend and nosy landlady 
   are both killed by Brusstar and Christine disappears, Jason goes on a 
   revenge spree of his own, killing Jimmy and McKee (he shoves a 
   butcher knife up McKee's ass!) and saves Brusstar for last, shooting 
   him a couple of times and then getting some &quot;eye-for-an-eye&quot;
    vengeance with the same power drill Brusstar used on Jason's best 
   friend. Sometimes revenge is not a dish best served cold.&nbsp; First 
   off, let me state that I'll watch Robert Forster in anything, even if 
   all he is doing is reading the phone book. He's a classy actor that 
   automatically improves any film he's in, even if it's just a cameo. 
   Thankfully, <B><A HREF="walking_the_edge_1983.htm">WALKING THE EDGE</A></B> 
   is a showcase for Forster's off-the-wall charms and is one of his 
   better early 80's films, made when Forster was beginning to go 
   through a bit of a dry spell (He had a lot of exposure in films and 
   TV during the 70's, starring in such films as <B><A HREF="medium_cool_1969.htm">MEDIUM

   [1972 - 73] and <B><A HREF="nakia_tv_series_1974.htm">NAKIA</A></B> 
   [1974]). His career waned throughout most of the 80's and early 90's, 
   resurging in the mid-90's, thanks to his Academy Award-nominated 
   performance in Quentin Tarantino's <B><A HREF="jackie_brown_1997.htm">JACKIE

    LUST AND VIOLENCE</A></B> - 1975; <B><A HREF="night_children_1989.htm">NIGHT
    CHILDREN</A></B> - 1989) gives us a relatively sleazy slice-of-life 
   exploitationer that's helped immensely by the on-location photography 
   of Hollywood's seedier landmarks and Curt Allen's expletive-filled 
   script, which contains some humorous, as well as racist, 
   dialogue&nbsp; (Forster must have liked the screenplay, because Allen 
   later wrote the script to <B><A HREF="hollywood_harry_1986.htm">HOLLYWOOD
    HARRY</A></B> [1985], the only directorial effort by Forster). The 
   most intense scene is when Brusstar, Jimmy and McKee torture Jason's 
   best friend Tony (A Martinez; <B><A HREF="not_of_this_world_1991.htm">NOT
    OF THIS WORLD</A></B> - 1991) with a power drill to try and get him 
   to give up Jason. The entire torture session is intercut with scenes 
   of Jason and Christine making love, which reveals a &quot;pleasure 
   and pain&quot; scenario that's very hard to watch. The 
   knife-up-the-ass runs a close second, as McKee pleads for his life in 
   the dingy bathroom of a punk rock bar, while Jason slowly shoves and 
   twists the knife further up his ass. Joe Spinell is his regular 
   sweaty self and has a humorous scene at a batting cage that 
   eventually turns nasty. As a matter of fact, this film is full of 
   baseball metaphors, some overt and some buried deep in the dialogue.

    VICTIMS</A><A NAME="WarVictims"></A> (1985) -</B> Some may view this 
   as a standard Indonesian sleaze epic, but they would only be 
   partially correct. This film actually makes a strong political 
   statement about patriotism and the willingness to suffer greatly for 
   your cause. During World War II, an Indonesian girl named Amelia 
   (Marissa Haque) is sent to an all-female P.O.W. camp, run by brutal 
   Japanese soldiers, after watching her rebel opposition boyfriend get 
   riddled with bullets by the Japs. Once at the camp, she and the other 
   women are subjected to sadistic torture and sexual abuse by the male 
   guards. Amelia, who is pregnant, loses her baby during one such 
   torture session, but she refuses to give up hope (She says, 
   &quot;Freedom must be earned. We must be willing to sacrifice 
   everything else in our life for it.&quot;). When the Allies bomb the 
   camp from the air (and accidentally kill one of the women), a 
   visiting Japanese General theorizes that one of the female prisoners 
   must be a spy (it's Amelia) since the camp is also a secret 
   ammunition depot (One of the female prisoners steps out of formation, 
   rips open her blouse and shows the General her hideously deformed 
   breasts, the product of the camp's torture techniques. The General is 
   so disgusted by what he sees, he orders her to be shot! His orders 
   are carried out immediately.). Amelia is raped the next day by the 
   camp's most brutal guard, Sgt, Tukigawa. When she reports it to the 
   camp's commander, Nokamura (the only Japanese <A HREF="war_victims_1983b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/war victims greek vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="164" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>soldier
    here depicted as having anything close to a conscience), he tells 
   Amelia that without corroboration, there's nothing he can do. When 
   two of his guards are killed by mistake (one is shot and killed by 
   his own buddy when his gun discharges accidentally), Nokamura has no 
   choice but to force the women to stand in the blazing sun with no 
   water. One of the women goes mad with heatstroke and is shot dead 
   trying to escape by climbing over the camp's barbwire fence. Amelia 
   and most of the women come up with a plan for escape and attempt it 
   one night when Nokamura is away (He's actually at headquarters 
   pleading for better treatment of his prisoners!). They fail 
   miserably, as some of the women are shot, one is attacked by a huge 
   snake, another steps on an explosive boobytrap and some are 
   electrocuted on the camp's fence. Amelia then becomes Nokamura's 
   lover, which pisses-off the rest of the female prisoners. Is Amelia 
   simply pretending until the right time comes along for her to strike 
   or is her love for Nokamura real? It seems it's a little of both, as 
   Amelia ends up pregnant with Nokamura's baby, but when the rebels 
   storm the camp and free the women, Nokamura commits hara-kiri rather 
   than being captured. Once again, Amelia is left alone and pregnant, 
   only this time she can raise her child in freedom.&nbsp; <B><A HREF="war_victims_1985c.htm">WAR
    VICTIMS</A></B> (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="war_victims_1983.htm">KAMP 
   TAWANAN WANITA</A></B>) will find no favor with Japanese viewers 
   thanks to their depiction here. All the Nippons, besides Nokamura, 
   are portrayed as maniacal laughing rapists who view the women in the 
   camp as disposable playthings to be used, abused and then killed with 
   hardly an afterthought. The scene where Nokamura leaves the camp to 
   plead with his superiors for humane treatment of his female 
   prisoners, only to be rebuffed, shamed and then told that these women 
   are nothing but cattle and are the spoils of war for the Japanese 
   soldiers to rape, cements the film's political agenda. Director Jopi 
   Burnama (<B><A HREF="ferocious_female_freedom_fighters_1982.htm">FEROCIOUS
    FEMALE FREEDOM FIGHTERS</A></B> - 1982; the amazing <B><A HREF="action.htm#Intruder1986">THE
    INTRUDER</A></B> - 1986), working with a script written by brother 
   Piet Burnama, doesn't skimp on the sleazier aspects of P.O.W. life 
   (there's rape, humiliation, whippings, hangings and brandings), but 
   there's more to this film than sleaze. Burnama shows what it really 
   means to suffer for freedom (most Americans could learn something 
   here), even if the beginning of the film is a little overblown, where 
   we hear a bombastic narrator say, &quot;War is a thrilling and 
   glorious thing only to those that have never experienced it in 
   reality!&quot; and he then goes on even longer giving us examples 
   why! The film closes with the same narrator saying, &quot;And this is 
   war! A Hell on Earth! Will the madmen of the world ever learn this 
   lesson?&quot;, followed by a stream of children dressed in white 
   walking across the landscape while &quot;The Beginning&quot; is 
   flashed on-screen. A little heavy-handed? Yes, but it does make it's 
   point rather effectively. The script has a little more meat on it's 
   bones than most Indonesian genre films, but it doesn't sacrifice 
   those ingredients we've come to expect from out friends in the Far 
   East: Namely, outrageous pieces of oddball dialogue (&quot;You're a 
   horse's ass, Mr. Stallion!&quot;), graphic violence (bodies explode; 
   a woman has a sword hammered through her torso while she is tied-up) 
   and nudity. Worth searching out. Also starring Boy Tirayoh, Mangara 
   Siahaan, Farida Ciptadi, Jeffi Sani, Ivina Anwar, Advent Cristy and 
   H. Usman Effendi. <B><A HREF="war_victims_1985d.htm">WAR VICTIMS</A></B>

   their lives are in danger, especially when they find a previous 
   kidnapee named Sam (Alona Alegre) drugged and sexually assaulted. The 
   arrival by helicopter of a group of men of varying nationalities 
   further cements that the ladies are in serious trouble. In case you 
   haven't guessed by now, the men have paid Spiros exorbitant sums of 
   money for the pleasure of setting these women free in the jungle to 
   hunt them down like animals. Tony doesn't agree with what is going 
   down, so he grabs the girls and some guns and they head for freedom, 
   while Spiros and the other men go on a practice hunt with Sam as the 
   prey. One of the girls is shot and killed by the guards during the 
   escape (Carp shoots and kills Silas for being drunk on his watch) and 
   another girl breaks her leg during the trek through the jungle, which 
   forces Tony and the remaining two girls to go on without her (She 
   does manage to gun down Carp and delay the hunt before Spiros kills 
   her). When another girl is bitten by a cobra and dies (Tony kind of 
   sucks at being a &quot;protector&quot;, doesn't he?), Tony and the 
   last girl decide to stay put and make a stand. Setting up spiked 
   booby traps, Tony and the girl wait for Spiros to show up (everyone 
   else, except Manda, are either dead or have fled the jungle). It ends 
   with a seriously wounded Spiros blowing his brains out (after he 
   mercifully puts a bullet in Manda's brainpan when she steps on a 
   spiked booby trap), even though he has Tony and the girl in his gun 
   sights, letting them escape to safety. This average 70's 
   exploitationer, directed and co-produced by Eddie Romero (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Brides Of Blood">BRIDES

   from Ashley and Pat Woodell, who both starred in Romero's <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#TwilightPeople1972">TWILIGHT
    PEOPLE</A></B> the same year) and not enough violence, as well as 
   some jarring jump cuts that seem to edit out huge chunks of the 
   story. I really don't understand why this was done (the film runs 
   slightly over 71 minutes) since there is plenty of nudity and bits of 
   R-rated violence on view (Sid Haig's death and the shooting in the 
   head of one hunter, where blood shoots out of the wound like a 
   gusher), but since this film was released by New World Pictures, it's 
   not unlikely that Roger Corman ordered the cuts to pick up the 
   pacing. The only problem is that <B><A HREF="woman_hunt_1972b.htm">THE
    WOMAN HUNT</A></B> is too disjointed now to hold the viewer's 
   complete interest. It just jumps from scene-to-scene with no 
   connective tissue, like an unfinished film. In my opinion, this is 
   minor 70's exploitation that is lacking in every department except 
   for nudity. Even the four kidnapped women, portrayed by Charlene 
   Jones, Lisa Todd, Laurie Rose and Liza Belmonte, are interchangeable 
   and lack distinct personalities. They are not given much to do but 
   disrobe and run around. Not a must-see unless you're a 70's 
   exploitation completist. Or easily entertained. Also starring Lotis 
   Key, Alfonso Carvajal, Ruben Rustia, Don Lipman, Tony Gosalvez and

   After watching director Rino Di Silvestro's <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#WerewolfWoman1976">WEREWOLF

   Women. Women in trouble. Women caught in situations beyond their 
   control. Women cursed to live a life they did not want. The first 
   thing I noticed when watching this film is how Silvestro doesn't give 
   many of the major characters proper names, only giving them nicknames 
   or labeling them by the crimes they committed or were convicted of. 
   Only the main protagonist is given a proper name, a subtle way of 
   getting the audience to feel for her. And feel you will.<A HREF="women_in_cell_block_7_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/women in cell block 7 poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="195" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A></FONT></FONT><BR>

    This film is actually a mixture of &quot;poliziotteschi&quot; 
   (Italian crime) and women in prison (WIP) genres, as we watch two New 
   York Mafia dons arrive in Rome and Interpol is tracking their every 
   move. They are after a large shipment of heroin and they are worse 
   than any crime syndicate, as you will see as the film unfolds. An 
   Italian Mafia don called Tonino kills the two New York dons, stealing 
   their drugs and spoiling Interpol's plans. When Tonino is killed in a 
   car chase, Interpol puts his girlfriend Daniela Vinci (Jenny Tamburi; <B><A HREF="psychic_1977.htm">THE
    PSYCHIC</A></B> - 1977) in the titled prison on a trumped-up charge 
   of drug possession. They put a female Interpol agent (Anita 
   Strindberg; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Almost Human">ALMOST HUMAN</A></B> 
   - 1974), the daughter of Mafia don Musumeci, in the same prison 
   prison, in hopes that she can get the location of where the shipment 
   of heroin is from Daniela. The only problem is, Daniela has no idea 
   where it is because her boyfriend never told her. Interpol doesn't 
   care, as they think she is lying and they will do anything to get her 
   to tell them where it is. Anything.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then watch a car chase, where a rival crime syndicate is chasing 
   Musumeci (they think he knows where the heroin is hidden) through the 
   streets of Rome and ending up at a quarry. His car is pushed over a 
   ravine, causing it to roll over. He gets out of the car and his fate 
   is not yet revealed (it will be as the film progresses)</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see that Musumeci is being tortured by his rivals. One thug 
   says, &quot;Pull his legs apart. I want to practice my dropkick!&quot;
    and then we hear Musumeci scream in pain.&nbsp; We will hear more 
   from Musumeci later. The film then switches to the prerequisite WIP 
   shower scene (lots of full-frontal nudity and lesbian action). 
   Mammasantissima (who I will refer to as &quot;Mamma&quot; in the rest 
   of the review because her nickname is to tough to memorize and type 
   [Fuck cut-and-paste, who hads time for that?]) says in the shower, 
   &quot;This soap smells like a whore's asshole!&quot; and Musumeci's 
   daughter (who I will now refer to as &quot;Inmate #1&quot; for the 
   same reason as Mamma) replies, &quot;Well, you outta know, 
   Sweetie!&quot; Mamma retorts, &quot;Listen, baby, go hump a 
   snake!&quot; (You'll be hearing a lot of that type of dialogue in 
   this film). Daniela gets a job in the prison's sewing facility and is 
   issued a new cell, her roomates being the pyromaniac, among others. 
   We then hear a love ballad titled &quot;Let It Rain&quot; on the 
   soundtrack while the pyromaniac tries to explain the &quot;beauty of 
   fire&quot; to Daniela (the pyro is on Interpol's payroll). Mamma puts 
   the moves on Inmate #1 when she is moved into her cell, but another 
   inmate throws a shoe at her and says, &quot;Get back in the sack, you 
   rotten lesbo!&quot; and Inmate #1 is safe...for now. The religious 
   fanatic goes to the Warden (Massimo Serato; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Autopsy1973">AUTOPSY</A></B> 
   - 1973) and asks for a change of cells because inmates are 
   persecuting her for &quot;praying to the Virgin&quot;. The Warden 
   agrees and puts her in the same cell as Daniela. Inmate #1 asks Mamma 
   if she has the pull to get Daniela transferred to their cell and she 
   says she will try, but she owes her. That includes being Mamma's sex 
   toy. A fire breaks out in Daniela's cell (I wonder who did it?) and 
   she barely makes it out alive. To add insult to injury, Daniela is 
   transferred to solitary and tied to her bed (it seems even the prison 
   matrons are on Interpol's payroll).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then watch as Musumeci escapes from his captors, stealing a gun 
   and running for his life. He is cornered in an underground sewer 
   system, yet he manages to escape and kills some of his rivals. Alas, 
   his freedom is short-lived, as he steps on a rotten plank on a 
   catwalk and falls to his death. The Godfather punishes the man he 
   thinks is responsible for Musumeci's death (He is also on Interpol's 
   payroll and wanted Musumeci alive) by throwing him in an incinerator 
   and watching him burn alive. Will Interpol tell Inmate #1 that her 
   father is dead? What do you think? Inmate #1 gets herself thrown into 
   solitary by slapping the Chief Matron (Olga Bisera) hard across her 
   face. This is her last chance to find out where the drugs are hidden. 
   As she is talking to Daniela through the wall between their cells, 
   she discovers that just before Tonino's death, he <A HREF="women_in_cell_block_7_1973_italy_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/women in cell block 7 italy poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="306" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>stopped
    at his aunt's house to deliver some cakes. It doesn't take a genius 
   to figure out that they were not cakes at all, but the missing 
   heroin. Inmate #1 contacts Interpol and they get the drugs. Do they 
   tell her that her father is dead? Does Daniela get out of the 
   hellhole of a prison? All will be answered in the finale, where the 
   women &quot;riot&quot; (If rioting is all the inmates stamping their 
   feet and yelling &quot;Fuck You!&quot; in unison) and the guilty (and 
   not-so-guilty) meet fitting demises.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   mustache and looks like a man, gives Mama a shit-eating grin full of 
   rotten teeth and Mamma shouts out, &quot;Oh rats! Geez, I feel 
   surrounded by you guys!&quot; which made me laugh out loud. This is 
   one of the few times all the inmates were smiling, a movie being 
   their only non-sexual pleasure in prison. Daniela's fate is 
   particularly upsetting. She is an innocent woman, her only crime 
   being that she was the girlfriend of a gangster and Interpol makes 
   sure that her life is a living hell. When it is revealed that she 
   unintentionally know where the drugs are hidden, someone poisons her 
   and when Inmate #1 tells her superiors that they should release her, 
   the Chief Matron tells Warden that she is dead. She was just an end

   Here's a lesser-known film from the busy Cirio H. Santiago. It's a 
   pretty standard WIP (Women In Prison) flick about a bunch of innocent 
   (and not so innocent) women who are kidnapped and brought to a remote 
   jungle camp where they are stripped, vaginally-inspected and told 
   they will be used as &quot;sexual playthings for the bad guys&quot;. 
   The camp, it turns out, is a training facility for assassins and as 
   the butch camp leader explains to her financiers about the assassins, 
   &quot;They're not robots. Sex is a need, like food.&quot; The new 
   girls are housed in a huge cave where some of the veteran prisoners 
   give them the skinny on their situation. They are enclosed in an 
   electrified fence and surrounded by jungle, which is full of swamps 
   and boobytraps, so escape is next to impossible. Every night, the 
   camp's sadistic warden (Ken Metcalfe), picks certain women to be used 
   for &quot;room service&quot;. They are cleaned-up, injected with an 
   aphrodisiac and taken to &quot;The Resort&quot;, a building that 
   contains rooms with nothing but beds, where they make love to the 
   assassins. If you don't come when the warden calls your number, he 
   simply shoots you point-blank in the chest and picks another woman. 
   The aphrodisiac eventually messes-up the women's nervous system, 
   causing them to go crazy or suicidal (one girl blows her head off 
   with an assassin's pistol and another <A HREF="women_of_hells_island_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/women of hell's island vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>jumps
    out a window to her death), which is why new women are brought to 
   the camp regularly. Three women try to escape, but one is shot in the 
   back, one is blown-up when she steps on a land mine and the last one 
   is recaptured and thrown in a &quot;Hot Box&quot; (a steel box buried 
   in the ground) as punishment. Some of the new girls begin to dig an 
   escape tunnel, but the veteran prisoners tell them that they are 
   wasting their time. Meanwhile, the fiance of one of the newly-kidnapped
    girls, Cindy (Bernadette Williams), puts the heat on the American 
   Embassy to find his girlfriend. That's when we find out that two of 
   the recently abducted women are actually undercover agents, but they 
   have yet to contact their superiors with their location. Some of the 
   veteran prisoners try to force their way out by taking the warden 
   hostage, but it all ends rather badly when all but one, Maggie (Kerry 
   Nichols), are massacred in a hail of automatic gunfire. Maggie is 
   then strung-up and whipped within an inch of her life. The warden 
   then rapes Cindy, but she grabs his knife and slices off his wang. 
   The warden kills Cindy with a couple of bullets to her chest and has 
   the camp doctor re-attach his penis. The finale finds the remainder 
   of the women escaping en mass through the tunnel and trying to make 
   it to a waiting plane, while avoiding enemy fire and a pissed-off 
   warden.&nbsp; Slow-moving and uninvolving, this exploitationer from 
   prolific Filipino director Cirio H. Santiago (<B><A HREF="action.htm#Devastator">THE
    DEVASTATOR</A></B> - 1985; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Silk1986">SILK</A></B> 
   - 1986) is too lethargic for it's own good. The script, by Santiago 
   regular Ken Metcalfe, is full of missed opportunities and gaping plot 
   holes (If you dig a tunnel in the jungle, how far do you have to dig 
   before you make it to safety?) and the film's snail-like pace gives 
   the viewer plenty of time to reflect on the deficiencies. Another 
   major problem is that we know precious little about these women, so 
   it's hard to get emotionally involved in their plight, even when they 
   are killed. All good WIP films give a little backstory to their 
   characters, so we can sympathize with them when they are put in 
   peril. There's none of that here, so when the women are killed 
   (especially the massacre after the warden is taken captive), it's 
   just like watching background characters taking a bullet. There's no 
   resonance. Santiago does throw in a lot of nudity and bits of gore 
   (impalements on spiked boobytraps, bloody bullet squibs, castration), 
   but without someone to identify with, it all rings hollow. That's 
   interesting, because Santiago produced such WIP classics like <B><A HREF="hot_box_1972.htm">THE

    WAY</A><A NAME="WrongWay1972"></A> (1972) -</B> Nancy and Cathy are 
   picked up by a pair of drug dealers after their car breaks down in 
   the middle of nowhere. After convincing the girls that they are 
   geologists (!), the girls jump into their truck, unaware that they 
   are about to be delivered to a bunch of slimeball bikers who have 
   just taken delivery of a brick of grass. As soon as Nancy and Cathy 
   are spotted by the rest of the group, they are gang-raped. Cathy is 
   forced to perform oral sex on Nancy and then they are terrorized by 
   one member with a coral snake. A visiting biker gang think that the 
   other guys are going too far, so they leave. When Cathy doesn't call 
   in at her scheduled time, her father calls the sheriff and reports 
   his daughter and Nancy missing. The sheriff investigates and finds 
   the girls' abandoned car. The girls, meanwhile, are still being raped 
   by the gang. After all the guys are done, they toss the girls aside 
   and leave (incredibly, the girls beg them not to leave them alone!), 
   forcing Nancy and Cathy to find their own way back to civilization. 
   After walking a short way, the girls run into a Manson-like man (Ron 
   Darby) and his &quot;f<A HREF="wrong_way_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wrong way 1972 british vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="176" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>amily&quot;
    (including a baby boy) as they are burying a dead body in the rocky 
   terrain. The Manson-like man (who wears a Japanese robe and has a 
   necktie tied around his forehead) takes the girls prisoner and tells 
   his followers that he plans on killing them, but first they will have 
   a little fun with them. I guess the filmmakers ran out of money, 
   because the rest of the film is displayed as a series of quick edits, 
   as the police dispatcher tells the sheriff that Nancy and Cathy were 
   rescued from the hippie cult (one cult member takes a shotgun blast 
   to the balls) and the sheriff is called out to an abandoned cabin, 
   where he gets into a gunfight with two guys who have a woman prisoner 
   in their car's trunk. After killing both of the men and being wounded 
   himself, the sheriff radios for help, telling them &quot;not to stop 
   for beer&quot; on the way. In the immortal words of the sheriff: 
   &quot;It's been a day. Not good, but different!&quot;&nbsp; Terrible. 
   Simply terrible. Atrociously acted, edited and photographed, this 
   film looks like it was all filmed on the first take, as lines are 
   constantly flubbed and the motorcycle gang has a hard time staying 
   vertical on their bikes (One guy falls off his bike and it lands on 
   him. You can't fake the pain he displays.). This is nothing but scene-after-scene
    of the girls being raped, intercut with scenes of the sheriff and 
   his men searching for them, all while some bad Bob Dylan-soundalike 
   sings a bad folk tune or bongo music plays on the soundtrack. While 
   there is both male and female full-frontal nudity on view and the 
   film flirts very near pornography territory, there is no hardcore 
   footage on view. Just endless scenes of softcore sex in every 
   position imaginable, including oral sex, intercut with endless scenes 
   of the sheriff talking into his radio or police cars driving around 
   dirt roads looking for the girls. There's also a weird scene in the 
   beginning of the film where the leader of the gang smokes a joint and 
   fantasizes about winning loads of money playing craps and poker, 
   followed by a nude girl in a cowboy hat and a tin foil star on one of 
   her nipples dancing around provocatively. That pot must be some good 
   shit! There's also a scene later in the film of two old guys and a 
   young girl in a cabin talking about trading the girl for some heroin 
   down in Mexico and then shots of the two guys screwing her. Since 
   neither scene has anything to do with the rest of the film, it's 
   apparent that one-time director Ray Williams put them in there to pad 
   out the running time. <B><A HREF="wrong_way_1972b.htm">WRONG WAY</A></B>

   hard to tell what late director Lawrence Dobkin (who was also an

   simple story about a backwoods family called the Erdlys who come into 
   eight thousand dollars when a piece of their land is sold for a 
   highway project. Ma Erdly (Mercedes McCambridge), Pa Erdly (Ford

    upon but some unscrupulous people who want to steal their money. 
   First up is a preacher (Parley Baer), who tries to guilt Pa into 
   giving him the money while guzzling down Pa's newly-bought moonshine. 
   Ma runs him off with her mop. The whole family treat themselves to a 
   bus trip to a county fair where Naomi is hit on by the motorcycle 
   cage rider Jake (Peter Green) and Bruvver falls in love with exotic 
   dancer Carmelita (Beverly Powers), who only goes after him because 
   she knows that his family has come into money. Jake sleeps with Naomi 
   and Carmelita has sex with Bruvver (after getting him drunk and 
   saying that they got married) in her motor home. They both miss the 
   bus home and Ma and Pa worry about what happened to them. Not to 
   worry as Carmelita pulls up to the Erdly's house the next morning in 
   her motor home demanding the money since she says that she is 
   entitled to it by law. After constant hijinks by J.C.., who lets the 
   air out of her tires and spits water at her, Carmelita just wants out 
   of the place. Along comes Jake and Naomi on his hog, drops Naomi off 
   and Carmelita jumps on the back as Ma chases them both off with her 
   mop. Bruvver and Naomi run off into the woods hand-in-hand and live 
   happily ever after. After a pretty funny beginning, especially the 
   scene where Ma has to tell a lawyer the names of her kids (Bruvver's 
   real name is Luke). The lawyer then asks if J.C. is short for 
   something biblical. She says J.C. is short for J.C. Penny, who was 
   running a sale the day she gave birth to him! Things go steadily 
   downhill from there. There's an implied scene that Bruvver and Naomi 
   are having an incestual relationship, but it is handled so tastefully 
   that you want to scream. There is some nudity (especially from 
   Griffeth, who was &quot;Annie Smith&quot; in <B><A HREF="death_race_2000_1975.htm">DEATH
    RACE 2000</A></B> - 1975), but absolutely no violence, blood or 
   gore. So one has to ask: What's the point of this film? The only 
   answer I could come up with is that backwoods folks are not so 
   different than us. They care about their kids and want the best for 
   them, even if they can't afford the best in life. And, oh yes: Money

   neverending quest to review every obscure film out there, this one 
   came in my mailbox unannounced. Since one of my greatest passions is 
   Italian genre films, I had to watch this one right away. Now I'm 
   sorry that I did. When Italian &quot;peplum&quot; films lost audience 
   interest, the country shaped like a boot began churning out films in 
   many genres, mainly Spaghetti Westerns, spy flicks, superhero films 
   and jungle films. This Italian Tarzan rip-off is an example of the 
   jungle film, a late entry made just before cannibal gore films became 
   popular. I'm surprised the estate of Edgar Rice Burroughs didn't sue

    The film opens with a quote from German philosopher Arthur 
   Schopenhauer: <B>&quot;In&nbsp; this world there is only one being 
   that is capable of being a liar: Man. Every other being is genuine 
   and sincere; they reveals themself as clearly as they express how 
   they feel.&quot;</B> But don't think this film has such lofty 
   ambitions. Far from it. In the early 20th Century, we see George Ryon 
   (Brad Harris; <B><A HREF="harry novak.htm#Mad Butcher">THE MAD BUTCHER</A></B> 
   - 1972) being handcuffed to a nameless prisoner (Mario Diosoni) as 
   they make a journey by train to a prison in Africa. George is going 
   to serve 30 years for a murder he didn't commit. Suddenly, the 
   nameless prisoner <A HREF="zambo_king_of_the_jungle_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/zambo dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>jumps
    off the train and George has no choice but to go with him (in one of 
   the lamest escapes ever committed to film). They run into the jungle 
   and steal a gun from one the guards that is chasing them (The 
   nameless prisoner wants to kill him, but George says no). It takes 
   George three tries to shoot off the cuffs and he runs into the 
   jungle, telling the no-name prisoner not to follow him, but he 
   insists on going with him. They try to escape the jungle by building 
   a raft and&nbsp; rowing down river, but all they do is go deeper into 
   the jungle. Hopelessly lost and three days without food, the prisoner 
   with no name begins to go a little crazy from hunger. He eats a plant 
   that turns out to be poisonous and he dies. George gives him a proper 
   funeral (&quot;I didn't even know your name!&quot;), walks for days 
   in the jungle and is captured by a tribe of spear-carrying natives 
   (Delirious, George imagines that the native Chief is the chief 
   prosecutor at his sham murder trial!). Years pass, and the legend of 
   Zambo, King of the Jungle is born. There is talk in Africa and abroad 
   of a white man who fights for the people and is kind to animals.

    We then see that an expedition, financed by Perkins (Daniele Vargas; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Eyeball1975">EYEBALL</A></B>

   said to contain a fortune in diamonds and jewels. George, or rather, 
   Zambo is aware of the expedition and secretly follows them, but he 
   finds time to break up an illegal native slavery ring headed up by 
   the nasty bad guy Mr. Morris (Enrico Chiappafreddo; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Manhunt1972">MANHUNT</A></B> 
   - 1972). When Mr. Morris asks his head native guide why he didn't 
   kill Zambo, he says, &quot;Zambo I not kill because he people's 
   friend!&quot; Mr. Morris vows to get even with Zambo. To show how 
   Zambo is the people's friend, we see him break up a fight between two 
   warring tribes (they are fighting because a member from each of their 
   tribes are getting married), simply by telling them that should have 
   a party! (the tribe members circle aroung him, raise their arms in 
   the air and shout &quot;Yea!&quot;). When the most insipid man in a 
   monkey suit tries to attack Grace, Zambo intervenes and offers to be 
   the expedition's guide, as long as they turn over all their guns to 
   him. They do and it's not long before Grace becomes Zambo's 
   &quot;Jane&quot;. He already has a &quot;Boy&quot;, a native child 
   named Ebon (short for Ebony?), who follows Zambo around. The 
   expedition is being followed by Mr. Morris, who hopes to get even

   &quot;Captain Tom Rowland&quot; in the <A HREF="kommissar_x_franchise_1966-1971.htm">Kommissar

   out there. He's so wooden here, I half expected a native to climb him 
   for his coconuts! Harris passed away in November of 2017. Nearly 
   everyone here, excluding Zambo, are given proper British accents, 
   even some natives! This film could have used a healthy dose of blood 
   and nudity, but even the native women are covered-up. Since this is 
   an Italian film, poor little Ebon is killed by Mr. Morris (Italian 
   filmmakers have no problems showing children getting killed) and 
   Zambo throws Morris over a cliff (an obvious dummy). There is some 
   nice jungle scenery (filmed in Tanzania and Uganda), but is is not 
   enough to make it watchable. The threadbare ape costume did make me 
   laugh, though. And wait until you see a tribe member break dance! 
   Even when the expedition finds the lost city, it is far too 
   fake-looking and clean to leave an impression. Zambo doesn't have a 
   signature yell, but he sure can beat a native drum! Johnny Weismuller 
   has nothing to worry about.</FONT></FONT><BR>
