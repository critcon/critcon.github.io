    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">During
     the early 80's, when home video was in it's infancy, an influx of 
    video companies were created to keep up with demand in the burgeoning 
    VHS rental market. Bear in mind that this was before owning videos 
    was financially feasible, as the cost for a single VHS copy of a film 
    could run well over $100. Renting videos was really the only way to<A HREF="paragon_vhs_covers.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/one armed executioner vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="172" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    watch most of these films at home, as TV gave up their 4:30 Movies, 
    Million Dollar Movies and Late Late Shows to make way for syndicated 
    talk shows, reruns of TV series and infomercials. A lot of 
    business-savvy companies jumped on the VHS bandwagon and created 
    labels to release films to a demanding public.&nbsp; A lot of them 
    were fly-by-night affairs, who released one or two films on VHS 
    before they realized that it takes money to make money, but some 
    companies stayed around for years. It's these companies that I am 
    going to pay their much-overdue props to. These companies released so 
    many films that occupied our nights and weekends during the 80's. 
    They turned out splashy covers, outrageous plot synopsis and hours 
    and hours of visual enjoyment to the renting market. A lot of obscure 
    films were released during this time, turning a lot of horror newbies 
    into lifelong fans. These long-gone companies had a major influence 
    on a lot of people, turning them into film directors, writers and 
    other film professionals, yet their impact seems to be taken for 
    granted. There's not a lot of information on these companies to be 
    found anywhere on the Internet or in print, except to list the films 
    that they released. Since I am a collector, I feel obligated to show 
    my readers the pleasures of the VHS video sleeve. When they are done 
    right, it's just like staring at a fine piece of art at a gallery. 
    Those day are long gone now and we must preserve the experience of 
    walking into a video store and <!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/terror 1978 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="97" HEIGHT="175" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0">looking
     at the shelves stocked with titles unfamiliar to us and the feeling 
    we got taking that chance of picking up an unknown film, bringing it 
    home and being blown away watching the TV screen ( although a lot of 
    times the reverse was true).</FONT></FONT></P>
   <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">Without
     the success of these companies, I doubt that there would be a DVD 
    market today. As the 80's came to a close, and it was getting 
    affordable to own pre-recorded films on VHS, many of these companies 
    went out of business, thanks to companies like Star Classics, 
    Interglobal, Goodtimes, Video Treasures and Starmaker licensing films 
    and releasing them in inferior LP or EP recorded versions, often 
    making them available in supermarkets as impulse buys at the checkout 
    line. Who could pass-up the chance of picking up <B><A HREF="toolbox_murders_1978.htm">THE
     TOOLBOX MURDERS</A></B> for less than ten bucks? The urge was simply 
    too great to pass up (yes, I was a major offender) and most of the 
    video companies gave up on releasing new product and grew fat 
    licensing their libraries to supermarket chain labels or simply sold 
    off their titles and closed up shop.</FONT></FONT></P>
   <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">Now
     that VHS is no longer considered a viable medium for releasing new 
    films (as well as old ones) and DVD has taken over (and rightly so, 
    thanks to the higher definition picture and better quality sound, not 
    to mention the supplements), I now believe it is time to look back at 
    the companies who released the films that we look back on with 
    reverence. The picture and sound quality may have left a lot to be 
    desired, but it was the only way to view these films at the time and 
    maybe forever as some of these films may never see the light of day 
    on DVD due to licensing and music rights. I believe, in the near 
    future, that the value of VHS tapes will only increase (both 
    monetarily and emotionally), becoming an obsession, just like someone 
    who collects posters or stamps. It is now time to pay our proper 
    respects. This is my tribute. (<I>Special thanks to the following

    (Academy handled parts 1 thru 6). As with all video companies 
    approaching the 90's, Academy got involved in producing and releasing 
    a load of DTV &quot;Erotic Thrillers&quot;, such as: <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Animal Instincts">ANIMAL
     INSTINCTS</A></B>, <B>BODY OF INFLUENCE</B>, <B>SINS OF THE NIGHT</B> 
    and many, many others until they closed-up shop in 1995. I also think 
    that there's a small conspiracy to keep Academy Entertainment VHS 
    covers off the Internet. The VHS covers for this company are nearly 
    non-existant anywhere on the web. If you don't believe me, try 
    Googling Academy and see what you come up with. Plenty of info on the 
    films that they released, but hardly any artwork. I believe my site 
    has the most Academy covers collected in one spot. To see the 
    collection, click <A HREF="academy_entertainment_vhs_covers.htm">HERE</A>.
     If no one ever hears from me again, it's because the Academy

    their films contained appearances by B-movie actors, such as David 
    Carradine, Robert Ginty (remember him?) Cameron Mitchell and Erik 
    Estrada. Action International closed up shop in 1994, partly due to 
    the Richard Pepin/Joseph Merhi company (PM Enterprises) turning out 
    superior action and horror flicks (they would eventually cease to 
    exist in 2000) and partly due to major video store chains no longer

    People who remember walking through the aisles of video stores during 
    the early 80's couldn't help but notice Continental's big boxes on 
    the shelves. Titles like <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Suicide Cult">SUICIDE
     CULT</A></B>, <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Redeemer 1976">CLASS 
    REUNION MASSACRE</A></B>, <B>NIGHTMARE</B> and <B>ALIEN PREY</B> 
    lined the shelves and attracted renters due to the garish artwork and 
    lurid tag lines. Continental went one further by releasing double 
    features on tape, pairing down two features to 75 minutes each and 
    releasing them on VHS. Double features like <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Slayer1981">SLAYER</A>/SCALPS,

     SUGAR</A>/ESCAPE FROM WOMEN'S PRISON</B> and <B>STUDENT

    because you got two movies for one rental. Most Continental and Comet 
    (who released the H.G. Lewis <B>BLOOD</B> trio for the first time on 
    video in America) titles go for big bucks nowadays, especially in 
    good condition, since most video stores cut the boxes up to fit them 
    into plastic clamshell cases (stupid idiots!). Continental began 
    distributing their later films in normal cardboard slipcases, as they 
    were probably sick, too, that their product was getting cut up. Some

    Bay: Instead of re-releasing the same old films over and over on DVD, 
    why don't you release some of Embassy's obscurities on DVD. I'm sure 
    that there is an audience for an uncut DVD of <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Rituals">RITUALS</A>.

    the early 90's, only to ressurect itself with new films (you can tell 
    their newer releases by the number &quot;2&quot; next to their logo 
    on the boxes) and a whole new generation of unaware film seekers 
    getting duped into buying or renting shitty films. And we wouldn't 
    have it any other way. Magnum finally closed-up shop for good in 1997

    released over 1,000 films on VHS before it ceased operations in 1992. 
    Media began by releasing public domain titles (back then, public 
    domain titles such as <B>PSYCHOMANIA</B> and <B>NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD</B> 
    weren't readily available on the market as they are today, so they 
    were new to the renters) and early Charles Band productions and then 
    graduated to the big time, thanks to some popular <B>CHARLIE BROWN</B> 
    titles and live concert performances. During the mid-to-late 80's 
    (long after Charles Band sold his interest in the company), Media was 
    king of the independent distributors, as they released popular 
    theatrical product (the <B>NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET</B> franchise and 
    much of New Line's 80's catalogue; Chuck Norris films such as <B>A 
    FORCE OF ONE</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">,</FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"> <B>THE

     WAR</B>, <B>MOTHER'S DAY</B> and, strangely enough, a lot of <A HREF="#TWE">Trans
     World Entertainment</A>'s theatrical releases) and also released a 
    lot of low-budget horror and action films that nearly all renters of 
    the 80's gobbled-up. Media released such titles as <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DontGoInHouse">DON'</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DontGoInHouse">T

    Media titles were as commonplace as major label's product in many

    sports-themed videos and many films never released to theaters, such 
    as <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#TerrorOnTour">TERROR ON TOUR</A></B>,

    Media had their hands in every type of genre, thereby cementing it's 
    dependability as a company that could meet anyone's 
    spur-of-the-moment urges. There are many unconfirmed stories about 
    Media's reputation and they need to be told. Unfortunately, until a 
    reliable source appears, these stories will go untold as much of 
    Media's catalogue is still around and still being distributed by 
    companies like <A HREF="http://www.anchorbayentertainment.com">Anchor Bay</A>,
     Fox and <A HREF="http://www.newline.com">New Line</A><B> </B>on DVD 
    (I don't want lawsuits, but there are rumblings of murder and 
    underworld connections.). To see but a small portion of Media's 
    output, click <A HREF="media_home_entertainment_vhs_covers.htm">HERE</A>.
     Media also released hard-R sex films under the &quot;Private 
    Screenings&quot; sublabel and older films and episodes of TV series (<B>ABBOTT
     &amp; COSTELLO</B>) under the &quot;Nostalgia Merchant&quot; label. 
    A lot of Media's early releases command big bucks today in the 
    auction market. I own a few from the late 70's and they play 
    perfectly. Just a side note here, but don't the early tapes weigh 
    much heavier than tapes produced in the last 10 years? You could drop 
    an older tape and nothing would happen. Drop a new tape and be 
    prepared to bring out the vacuum as it will shatter into hundreds of 
    small pieces. The older tapes were made to last, and 25 years later 
    they play as well as the first time.</FONT></FONT></P>

     company, cranking out films since the early 1920's. Their huge 
    library of films was ideal for the home video market, so in 1979 they 
    joined forces with CBS Home Video to form MGM/CBS Home Video. In 
    1981, CBS broke off with MGM to join with 20th Century Fox to form 
    CBS/Fox Home Video. That same year, MGM joined with United Artists to 
    form MGM/UA Home Video and that partnership lasted until 1998, when 
    Ted Turner bought the MGM library and renamed the label MGM Home 
    Entertainment. For seventeen years, MGM/UA released thousands of 
    films on VHS, including many that have still yet to see the light of 
    day on DVD. MGM/UA is most fondly remembered for releasing their 
    films in those big cardboard boxes that opened up like a book (They 
    also had a blue piece of tape shaped like a giant &quot;I&quot; that 
    stuck to the middle of the right hand side or bottom of the box, 
    either covering a portion of the artwork or the credits. If you tried 
    to remove it, more times than not it would destroy whatever was below 
    it.). Time has not been kind to those big boxes, as they have faded 
    or wrinkled due to the ravages of time, but who can't help but 
    remember seeing those big box releases, like <B>GYMKATA</B>, <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Equalizer2000">EQUALIZER

    lining the video store shelves. MGM/UA had exclusive deals with 
    Cannon Films and Roger Corman's Concord Films during the 80's and 
    many of those big box releases command high prices on the collectors' 
    circuit due to their rarity and the fact that they have never been 
    released to DVD. MGM/UA was also one of the first major VHS companies 
    to encode their tapes with the Macrovision process to curtail piracy 
    and illegal copying. Nearly every MGM/UA VHS tape produced was 
    Macrovision encoded, so if you ever think of buying their tapes to 
    back up to DVD, just remember that you will need a device to bypass 
    the encoding. To view a fraction of MGM/UA Home Video's output, click <A HREF="mgm_ua_home_video_vhs_covers.htm">HERE</A>.
     If I were to show you cover scans of every MGM/UA tape produced, I 
    would probably take you days to get through them. I still recommend a

    probably more enjoyable than the film on the tape. While I don't 
    pretend to know squat about Paragon's history, I do know that they 
    were located in Las Vegas, Nevada, were originally known as &quot;King
     Of Video&quot; and released product from late 1981 until 1985, 
    making them one of the earliest companies in the home video rental 
    market for genre films. I made it a quest of mine to own as many 
    Paragon VHS tapes as I can get my hands on. Thanks to <A HREF="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</A>,
     I have been able to purchase a lot of them for less than two bucks. 
    They play just as good now as they did when they were new and some of 
    them are nearly 25 years old! To see my collection of Paragon Video

    basically for releasing little-known films and hardly had any major

    of films such as<B> <A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Dark sanity">DARK SANITY</A></B>,

    Still, Prism had a good 11 year run and entertained a lot of renters 
    during the 80's, which is why you will find a lot of their releases 
    reviewed on this site. Prism also released product for a label called 
    A.N.E. Home Video (American National Enterprises), which distributed 
    a bunch of even-more obscure titles such as <B>BEASTS</B>,&nbsp; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#JohnnyFirecloud">JOHNNY

    point, you will wonder how this Raedon direct-to-video garbage ever 
    got made.</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">The
     answer is the 1980s. Or, more specifically, the 1980s video boom. 
    The VCR had created a new, wide-open<A HREF="raedon_vhs_covers.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/vampyre raedon vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="113" HEIGHT="200" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    market -- home video -- for movies. Mom-and-pop video stores, 
    prevalent over chains at the time, were blindly stocking just about 
    anything that was offered up. Cheapjack video labels proliferated -- <A HREF="#Vestron Video">Vestron</A>,
     <A HREF="#Lightning Video">Lightning</A>, <A HREF="#Prism">Prism</A>,
     <A HREF="#Academy Ent.">Academy</A>, <A HREF="#TWE">Transworld</A>, <A HREF="#Vidmark">Vidmark</A>,
     <A HREF="#Magnum Entertainmen">Magnum</A>.</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">And
     then there was Raedon Home Video. For those who think they know the 
    definition of amateurish moviemaking, throw out your standards. A 
    typical Raedon release features actors mispronouncing common words, 
    anachronistic period costumes that are 250 years off the mark and 
    love scenes with actors that appear to be entirely unfamiliar with 
    the sex act. This is, of course, in addition to unintelligible 
    dialogue, camera angles and acting. The quality of these movies 
    cannot be understated.</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">But
     even if Raedon is guilty of egregious transgressions against the art 
    of cinema, the video label does serve one important function to 
    culture: the story of the '80s video boom can most colorfully be told 
    through the history of this single video distributor.</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">&quot;In
     those days, it was kind of like the Wild West,&quot; says Bruce G. 
    Hallenbeck, whose 1989 film <B>VAMPYRE</B> was picked up by Raedon. 
    &quot;There were no real fast and hard rules, and everything was kind 
    of being made up as it went along. And you could pretty much release anything.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">So
     this VCR-created boom was good for aspiring '80s filmmakers, maybe 
    not so good for the artistic quality of low-budget cinema.</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="raedon_vhs_covers.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/death collector raedon vhs front small2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="113" HEIGHT="200" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>&quot;It
     ruined everything,&quot; says filmmaker Michael Lang. &quot;It 
    destroyed the B-movie theatrically.&quot; Lang worked in several 
    capacities on the 1988 futuristic rockabilly sci-fi Western film <B><A HREF="death_collector_1988.htm">DEATH
     COLLECTOR</A></B>, a surprisingly tolerable Raedon video release.</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">Understand,
     in the 1970s, low-budget exploitation films were experiencing their 
    golden age, playing at drive-ins and grindhouses across the country, 
    giving the world stylish cult faves like The Texas Chain Saw 
    Massacre, Vanishing Point, Sweet Sweetback's Badasssss Song and 
    Assault on Precinct 13.</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">Compare
     those titles against the disposable, what-the-hell-is-this-shit '80s 
    fare offered in the Raedon catalog: <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#PunkVacation">PUNK
     VACATION</A></B>, <B>GAME OF SURVIVAL</B>, <B>NUDITY REQUIRED</B>, <B>FEELIN'
     SCREWY</B> -- films that are even worse than their titles might indicate.</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">Raedon
     Home Video got into the VHS game in the late '80s, about ten years 
    into that format's existence. By then, many low-budget filmmakers 
    weren't even gunning for theatrical releases for their movies. They 
    were simply hoping to dump their movies into a video release. And 
    Raedon obliged.</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">Based
     in Southern California (Northridge then Chatsworth), Raedon often 
    dealt with movie sales companies like Double Helix and Panorama 
    instead of brokering home video deals with the filmmakers themselves. 
    This meant sometimes a director had little contact with the video 
    label distributing his movie.</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">&quot;The
     first day I saw the tape in a video store here I was stunned,&quot; 
    says Hallenbeck, &quot;because I hadn't been told it was going to be 
    out that soon. About six months after we completed all the post 
    production it was in the stores. At one of the local video stores 
    here, the owner said, 'Hey, your movie's here.' I looked at it and 
    said, 'I'll be damned. My first feature.'&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">But
     Lang had a little more contact with the video label. He got to see 
    Raedon's headquarters.</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">&quot;It
     was just a warehouse,&quot; he says. &quot;A warehouse with a few 
    offices in the front. And the owner was this big fat guy that looked 
    like Grizzly Adams. He was dressed in a t-shirt and shorts. I wasn't 
    exactly impressed.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">But
     what should one expect from the distributor of movies that are 
    arguably the worst ever made? Even Raedon filmmakers concede that the 
    label's releases are rubbish.</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">Says
     Lang, &quot;Raedon was for the filmmakers who were basically inept 
    fools who made inept product which they couldn't sell to anyone else, 
    so they ended up at Raedon. Or Troma. I mean, Troma is the other 
    Raedon of the business. Troma is just smarter, because they made 
    their own movies, and they made trashy movies.&quot;<A HREF="raedon_vhs_covers.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/alien private eye raedon vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="105" HEIGHT="190" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A></FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">Clearly,
     the centerpiece of ineptitude in Raedon's catalog is a 1987 film 
    entitled <B>ALIEN PRIVATE EYE</B>. The film may not yet have a Plan 
    9-type status as a Holy Grail of Bad Cinema, but those who have seen 
    it know the score. A video copy on Half.com recently had the asking 
    price of $69.75.</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">&quot;It's
     a piece of shit,&quot; says actor Robert Axelrod, who played the 
    villainous Scunge in the film (&quot;I was 'Scunge.' That's a stupid name.&quot;).</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">&quot;I
     was astonished at the ineptitude,&quot; says Michael Jonascu, who 
    worked on the film's sound but didn't want his company's name to 
    appear in the closing credits.</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B>ALIEN
     PRIVATE EYE</B> is deserving of this derision and more. It stars 
    former Chippendales dancer Nikki Hill (aka Nikki Fastinetti) as 
    Lemro, the eponymous extra-terrestrial gumshoe. The plastic Spock 
    ears let us know he's an alien. The clich&eacute;d fedora lets us 
    know he's a private eye. Other than that, Hill just tries to play 
    Lemro as an '80s tough guy (&quot;Yo!&quot;) in a performance that 
    makes the viewer sad to be a human being.</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">&quot;I
     did [later] see it in a video bin,&quot; says Jonascu of <B>ALIEN 
    PRIVATE EYE</B>. &quot;It was like a buck ninety-nine. And I thought, 
    'You know, I should probably pick this up. It's part of my 
    filmography, for better or worse.' And I didn't. I think that kind of 
    says a lot of it. It was two bucks and I didn't want to shell out the 
    cash for it.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">Surprisingly,
     there is actually a &quot;name&quot; filmmaker who has an early 
    credit in the movie: writer-director Scott Spiegel, who is well known 
    in horror circles for his involvement in the Evil Dead and From Dusk 
    Till Dawn series. Spiegel feels no embarrassment for his minor 
    participation in this sub-sub-competent flick.</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">&quot;You
     have to understand,&quot; he says. &quot;When I came out here from 
    Detroit, that was still kind of fun. That was cool. Someone was 
    making movies. Let's do it.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="raedon_vhs_covers.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ain't no way back raedon vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="101" HEIGHT="197" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>In
     fact, Raedon releases occasionally catch a star on the way up or 
    down. A pre-fame Campbell Scott (Singles, Roger Dodger) appears in <B>AIN'T
     NO WAY BACK</B>, a bizarre mishmash of Deliverance and Witness. And 
    washed-up stars of yesteryear like Julie Newmar, Troy Donahue and 
    Rory Calhoun each slummed in a Raedon film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">Fortunately,
     all things -- even the indescribably horrid -- must end. The '80s 
    video boom became the video glut of 1990.</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">&quot;It
     was the last time with all those crappy movies being sold, when 
    people were actually buying that stuff,&quot; says Lang. &quot;The 
    '80s were an incredible time for that, with the ravenous need for 
    video product. But it got so glutted that by 1990 it just completely 
    collapsed. The floor was like a trap door.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">&quot;Buyers
     were looking for better product, higher quality product,&quot; 
    continues Lang. &quot;I think that killed Raedon too. The video store 
    owners had had enough of all this crap. I mean, it worked for a few 
    years, but I think there was just too much of it.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">So
     what lessons were learned? Maybe few. Lang, Hallenbeck and Jonascu 
    say they see a present-day parallel to home video's legitimization of 
    16mm hack filmmaking&nbsp; of the late '80s.</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">&quot;A
     lot of people dove in at that point,&quot; says Jonascu. &quot;And I 
    think the thing that is most like that now is that DV has gotten so 
    good that you're starting to see a lot of the same thing happening again.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">As
     for final thoughts on the phenomenon of the '80s video boom, Lang 
    says it most succinctly: &quot;Raedon caught the wave. And then the 
    wave left them. It left everybody.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">But
     Spiegel has the best understanding of the route the era's low-budget

    (1952), but Yates always kept his hands in the B-movie field, 
    churning out small films in every genre (they were also the first 
    studio to offer their film library to TV in 1951). As the 50's were 
    coming to a close and the demand for small films was waning (thanks 
    to TV), Republic Pictures closed up shop in 1959. In 1962, Republic 
    sold it's film library to National Telefilms Associates (NTA) and, in 
    the early 80's, NTA began releasing Republic Pictures' films on VHS. 
    NTA would eventually buy the right to the Republic Pictures name and 
    logo in 1986 and release films under the Republic Picture Home Video 
    banner. A mixture of old films&nbsp; (<B>INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS</B>

    you have done so, never, EVER purchase any of them, even if you can 
    get them for free. They are the worst of the worst. No, not the 
    films. Some of them are pretty good. I'm talking about the transfers. 
    Most of them were recorded in the EP speed and have the worst 
    tracking problems in VCR history.

     tapes are unwatchable and seem to have been mass-produced to make 
    the buyer extremely angry. I should know. I own a good chunk of them. 
    Simitar was in existence from 1984 to 2000. While the majority of 
    their releases were sports, children's and outdoor documentaries, 
    they did release some films aimed at the horror film lover. 
    Unfortunately, once you brought the tape home you usually ended up 
    cursing at your VCR, screaming &quot;Why are you doing this to 
    me?&quot; at the top of your lungs, thinking that your VCR was the 
    offending party. Well, we know better now. I was the recipient a few 
    years ago of aquiring the majority of a small video store's inventory 
    and about 50 of the tapes were from Simitar. After playing them all 
    in four different VCRs, only one of them played correctly throughout. 
    That film was Jeff Hathcock's <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Victims">VICTIMS</A></B>,
     and since it was the only Simitar tape recorded in the SP mode, I'm 
    not surprised. The only trouble was the print they used looked like a 
    third generation dupe and was nearly unwatchable anyway. So, heed my 
    advice and stay away from these releases. A lot of people try to pawn 
    them off on eBay for outrageous prices. Ask questions and demand to 
    see the cover before you buy. Here's another little tidbit about 
    Simitar: In 1999, the World Wrestling Federation sued Simitar for 
    trademark infringement for selling a CD of music titled WWF-THE 
    MUSIC, VOL. 3 and won. This led to Simitar's downfall in 2000 when 
    they declared bankrupcy. The owners then went to Brentwood 
    Communications, Inc. (BCI) and started a DVD division. Everyone knows 
    the troubles that ensued with the quality of the early BCI releases. 
    Some of them would skip in various players and I have one that died 
    during the final 30 minutes of <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Messiah Of Evil">MESSIAH
     OF EVIL</A></B>. Simitar was also the first independent distributor 
    to release their films to DVD (in 1997), but they were just as hinky 
    as their VHS releases. To see a collection of Simitar Entertainment 
    VHS covers, click <A HREF="simitar_entertainment_vhs_covers.htm">HERE</A>.

     &quot;Are you going to do ThrillerVideo?&quot; more times than I 
    care to remember.&nbsp; ThrillerVideo was a sub-label of Family Home 
    Entertainment (which also ran the <A HREF="#Monterey">Monterey Home Video</A> 
    and <A HREF="usa_home_video_vhs_covers.htm">U.S.A. Home Video</A> 
    labels) and was active for a short period, from 1983 - 1986. 
    ThrillerVideo released most of their product in big colorful boxes 
    and the majority of them were hosted by Elvira, who would do her 
    schtick at the beginning of the film, interrupt it during the middle 
    and the show up at the end of the flick to show trailers of coming 
    ThrillerVideo attractions. Most of Elvira's hosting duties were on 
    episodes of British TV's 1980 series <B>HAMMER HOUSE OF HORROR</B> 
    and ran less than 60 minutes each. Elvira didn't host ThrillerVideo's 
    episodes of Britian's 70's series of 90 minute mystery films called <B>THRILLER
     </B>(shown on ABC's <B><A HREF="abc_wide_world_of_entertainment_tv_ads_1973-1976.htm">WIDE

     WORLD OF MYSTERY</A></B> at 11:30 PM during the mid-to-late-70's in 
    the U.S.). Elvira also hosted the odd horror film, such as Fredric 
    Hobb's strangely facinating <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Alabamas Ghost">ALABAMA'S
     GHOST</A></B> (which really needs a DVD release), the ultimate

     But, even Elvira had her standards. She refused to host five of 
    ThrillerVideo's more extreme horror films, citing that hosting them 
    would damage her credibility (!). Those films were: <B>MAKE THEM DIE SLOWLY</B>,
     <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Nightstalker">NIGHTSTALKER</A> </B>(a.k.a.
     <B>DON'T GO NEAR THE PARK</B>), <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BeyondTheDarkness79">BURIED

     BUTCHER M.D.</A></B> and <B>THE 7 DOORS OF DEATH</B>. These five 
    films in their big boxes command the most money on the collector's 
    market of all the ThrillerVideo releases, mainly because they were 
    uncut and they weren't interrupted by Elvira's sometimes 
    cringe-inducing jokes and gags. To see a collection of

    (which is still in business today) was a very early player in the VHS 
    market and released some very choice titles in the early days of home 
    video. The old VCI cardboard slipcases were rather drab, with a gray 
    and black border (with epaulets on the bottom) with the film's poster 
    artwork in the middle. But, some of the titles were desirable (even 
    today): <B>SWAP MEET</B>, <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Screams Winter">SCREAMS
     OF A WINTER NIGHT</A></B>, <B>NAKED PARADISE</B>, <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#WerewolfWoman1976">LEGEND
     OF THE WOLF WOMAN</A></B> and many others were released in the late 
    70's and early 80's, many commanding big bucks on the collector's 
    market today. United Home Video, on the other hand, had the claim of 
    releasing the first SOV made-for-home video film (a claim that I find 
    suspect) in 1985. That film would be <B>BLOOD CULT</B> and it was a 
    smash hit, causing nearly every video distributor to try their hand 
    at producing and releasing cheap SOV films. <B>BLOOD CULT</B> was so 
    big that a sequel was made (the slightly-better <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Revenge 1986">REVENGE</A></B>)
     the next year and they also made <B>THE</B> <B>RIPPER</B> starring 
    Tom Savini. United released a lot of their early films in colorful 
    clamshell cases, but later began releasing films in standard 
    cardboard slipcases before disappearing in the early 90's. During the 
    80's, it was nearly impossible not to rent a horror film that wasn't 
    released by United or VCI, especially some of the rarer titles (at 
    the time). <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Asylum of Satan">ASYLUM OF SATAN</A></B>,

     VIDEO<A NAME="Vestron Video"></A></FONT> - </B>This is the 
    single-most important video distribution company in VHS history. 
    Vestron Video, a Norfolk, Connecticut-based company, released over 
    3,000 (!) films and specials on VHS during the years of 1983 - 1995. 
    They started out releasing mainly B-Movies and gradually began 
    releasing more-popular theatrical films on VHS until major studios 
    wised-up and recognized that there was a profit to be had in 
    distributing videos, which eventually led to Vestron's downfall. 
    Their visibility <A HREF="vestron_video_vhs_covers.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/future kill vestron vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="93" HEIGHT="161" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/nomad riders vestron vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="91" HEIGHT="160" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>was
     just not in the U.S., as Vestron formed an international division 
    (called Vestron International), and released films on VHS to Europe, 
    Asia, South America and Australia.&nbsp; Later, Vestron formed a 
    theatrical distribution arm (called Vestron Pictures) and had a 
    monster hit with <B>DIRTY DANCING</B> (1987), which also spawned a 
    Number 1 soundtrack album and Broadway musical. Vestron (which many 
    scholars believe made renting an everyday habit) was also an early 
    adopter of Laserdisc and released many of their films in that format. 
    I own a huge amount Vestron releases, as many collectors do, for the 
    simple reason that it was the only way back then to see a lot of rare 
    and obscure films. Vestron had so many films in it's roster that it 
    formed a sublabel, called <A HREF="#Lightning Video">Lightning Video</A>,
     to release some of their more exploitative titles (although Vestron 
    was not above releasing titles like <B>BLOODSUCKING FREAKS</B> and <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BloodDiner1987">BLOOD
     DINER</A></B> under their flagship banner). To list all of Vestron

     many, many others for the first time on VHS to a thankful audience 
    looking for something different. If I have one complaint about 
    Vestron, it is that the glue the used to apply the label to the face 
    of the VHS tape would eventually dry-up, leading to the label falling 
    off (this has happened to nearly every Vestron tape I own!). In 1995, 
    LIVE Entertainment (later called Artisan Entertainment and eventually 
    being swallowed by the Lions Gate Entertainment juggernaut) acquired 
    the entire Vestron catalogue, thereby ending the biggest VHS dynasty 
    in rental history. To see but a small sampling of Vestron's extensive

    Video Gems releases are considered collectable today. There's a 
    reason for that. They geniunely cared about what they released. To

     a late 70's unfinished film whose main claim to fame was a role by a 
    young Madonna (billed here as Madonna Louise Ciccone). Madonna 
    unsuccessfully tried to block it's release, which made this film even 
    more desirable to the viewing public. It was quickly forgotten, 
    however, because it was a piece of 8mm rubbish and had no redeeming

    theatrical releases on home video, including <B>MYSTIC PIZZA</B>

    rather bland. Once they changed to the big box format, renters stood 
    up and took notice. The colorful artwork and inventive advertising 
    made these oversized releases desirable to the collector. Wizard 
    released a lot of European horror films that were, at the time, 
    unknown by many people. Titles, such as Jess Franco's <B>THE 
    INVISIBLE DEAD</B>, <B>THE SCREAMING DEAD</B> and <B>DEMONIAC</B>, 
    the Paul Naschy-starrers <B>CRIMSON</B> and <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HangingWoman1973">RETURN

    renters to eat up. I wonder how many people became Jess Franco and 
    Paul Naschy fans because of these releases? Wizard's biggest 
    claim-to-fame were their direct-to-video releases like David 
    DeCoteau's <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Dreamaniac">DREAMANIAC</A></B>,
     Tim Kincaid's <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Breeders1986">BREEDERS</A></B>,

    compilations <B>FILMGORE</B>, <B>BEST OF SEX AND VIOLENCE</B> and <B>ZOMBIETHON</B> 
    (which were all basically short clips of their entire VHS catalogue), 
    original product that made them stand out from the rest of the horror 
    pack. My favorite Wizard big box cover has to be their release of <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#HeadlessEyes1971">THE
     HEADLESS EYES</A></B>. The sight of an eyeball (with the optic 
    nerves still attached) lying on the pavement next to a dead woman 
    always makes me smile. Wizard Video's advertising campaign was so 
    successful that the majority of horror film renters from the 80's 
    probably remember them better than any other video company. Their 
    brand was so memorable that Charles Band (who owned Wizard Video from 
    the beginning) is now again using the logo for a cult subdivivion of 
    Full Moon and is releasing some of his older films, including <B><A HREF="intruder_1989.htm">INTRUDER</A></B>

    not quite as good as SP. Started by the colorful Cayre brothers,

    sold 3 million dollars worth of tapes in the first year and turned 
    Goodtimes into a major budget label, selling films of all genres, 
    Richard Simmon's Sweating To The Oldies exercise tapes, animated 
    videos to compete with Walt Disney (who sued Goodtimes for trademark 
    infringement and lost!) and now they release mainly Christian-themed

    had just recently stopped hosting duties on <A HREF="#ThrillerVideo">ThrillerVideo</A>'s
