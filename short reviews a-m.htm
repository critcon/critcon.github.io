    THE RIVER</A><A NAME="AcrossTheRiver2013"></A> (2013) -</B> 
   Interesting Italian horror film that takes you in unexpected 
   directions.&nbsp; An ethologist (a person who studies animal behavior 
   with emphasis on the behavioral patterns that occur in natural 
   environments) by the name of Marco Contrada (Marco Marchese) traps 
   animals in the remote woods on the Slovenian border and attaches 
   cameras to them so he can study their movements. The footage from one 
   of these cameras will lead him to an even more remote village, where 
   he will become trapped and what he discovers will change his life 
   forever, that is if he survives the ordeal. But I am getting ahead of 
   myself, so let's move back to the beginning&ldots;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While in the remote woods, collecting memory cards he has on 
   motion-activated cameras connected to trees, Marco discovers 
   something strange floating in the river, what looks like two young 
   girls' white night dresses, the kind girls use to wear years ago when 
   they went to bed. He finds it somewhat strange, but he has seen 
   stranger things in the woods and continues to do his job, setting up 
   cages to capture animals he previously tagged with cameras, such as 
   wild boar and deer. We then see an old man (Renzo Gariup) and his 
   wife (Lidia Zabriezach) in bed, the old man awoken by a strange noise 
   he heard in the woods, but his wife tells him to ignore it and come 
   back to bed. It's a noise he has heard before and by the look on his 
   face, it is not a noise he thought he would ever hear again. Marco 
   spends the night in a shack in the woods and the next morning goes 
   about his business of collecting memory cards from the cameras he has 
   placed on trees. He then hears the same strange noise as the old man 
   and it turns out to be a thirteen-pound fox that he had previously 
   tagged with a camera that he has caught in one of his cages. He 
   shoots a tranquilizer dart with a blowgun into the fox's body and 
   removes the memory card from the camera and then lets the fox go free 
   when it awakens. He begins to view the memory card on his laptop in 
   his RV and is taken aback by some footage showing the fox traveling 
   some place he has never seen before; a strange village where the 
   buildings look ancient in their construction, like something out of a 
   medieval textbook. He follows the coordinates on the footage with his 
   RV, crossing a river whose <A HREF="across_the_river_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/across the river italy poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>water
    is about to rise to dangerous levels thanks to the torrential rain 
   outside. He ends up in a remote village he didn't know existed, a 
   large stone wall surrounding it. Marco searches the village and it 
   seems to be deserted, but he will soon find out it is anything but. 
   As night comes, he discovers the carcass of a 240-pound wild boar he 
   had previously tagged and there are bites on the abdomen of the 
   still-warm carcass. They look like human bites, yet the body looks 
   torn apart by something with large claws, something not human. He 
   then hears a noise that chills him to the bone, so he runs to his RV 
   and locks himself inside it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Marco watches the footage taken from the dead wild boar and sees 
   something large tearing it apart, the camera not revealing what is 
   doing the deed, but scaring him enough to grab his shotgun and go 
   outside to see if he can find what caused it. Marco finds nothing, 
   but chalks it up to a pack of wolves. He then gets in his RV and 
   begins to head back to civilization, but the river he needs to cross 
   is overflowing and he has no other way to get back, so he is forced 
   to stay in the village. He gets the feeling that he is not alone (he 
   finds a pocket watch and a book full of strange symbols, as well as 
   deer bones scattered throughout the village), so he sets up a 
   motion-activated camera in the village to alert him of movement, 
   which it does in the middle of the night, waking him up, so he goes 
   outside for a look, armed with a flashlight, a directional locator 
   and his shotgun. He finds blood in places it wasn't earlier in the 
   day and hears glass clanging in one of the buildings (where there's 
   an old family photo, where the faces of two young girls, twins [?], 
   are scratched out). Whomever, or whatever, it was manages to stay out 
   of sight. To make matters worse, it begins raining heavily again, 
   further prolonging Marco's stay in the village.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Marco hopes to discover who or what it is that manages to stay 
   hidden by watching more footage on the memory cards and discovers an 
   ominous scream that scares all the animals away. But what could it 
   be? He then sees two young girls, the same girls in the old photo, 
   dressed in white night dresses in some of the footage, seen 
   immediately after the scream is heard (Their eyes eerily glow in the 
   dark, the result of the camera recording in night vision mode, but 
   eerie nonetheless). Things go from bad to worse when Marco discovers 
   that his RV is missing, forcing him to stay in the village at night, 
   every building's roof leaking during the torrential rainstorm, 
   putting him on further edge. And making matters much worse is that he 
   is now getting sick from a mysterious illness, making him cough up 
   blood and upchuck. Is it possible that this village is cursed and 
   Marco is the latest victim? Count on it, as the more he tries to find 
   a way out of the village and back to civilization, it only leads him 
   back to the village. We then watch the old man listening to a radio 
   news report about Marco, saying he has vanished in the woods of 
   Eastern Friuli on the Slovenian border and it is impossible to search 
   for him due to the severe weather. Will Marco survive this ordeal or 
   will he become another victim of the village's curse?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This was one of those movies I watched on a whim, with no 
   inclination of writing a review, but after viewing it, I thought it 
   was worthy of my pen. This was a film I picked while perusing the 
   synopsis on Amazon Prime, no idea of what it was about (or that it 
   was Italian!) except for a brief, one sentence description. Hoping it 
   wasn't a &quot;found footage&quot; film (a subgenre I despise) , my 
   hopes were nearly dashed by the black and white POV footage of 
   animals in the woods&nbsp; that opened the film, but my worries were 
   relieved when Marco appeared. While there are found footage aspects 
   to the film, including footage the old man shows to Marco's Civil 
   Defense rescuers; home movies taken by soldiers during World War II, 
   showing how strange the village was, even back then (giving us an 
   inkling of what Marco is about to go through, but if I described it, 
   it would ruin the film for you), but it is integral to the plot and 
   therefore necessary. While basically a one person film until the old 
   man appears two-thirds into the film, director Lorenzo Bianchini (<B><A HREF="lorenzo_bianchini_films.htm">THE
    SQUARE ROOT OF THREE</A></B> - 2001; <B><A HREF="lorenzo_bianchini_films.htm">CUSTODY
    OF THE BEAST</A></B> - 2004; <B><A HREF="lorenzo_bianchini_films.htm">EYES</A></B> 
   - 2010), working with a screenplay written by himself and wife 
   Michela Bianchini, keeps things interesting with a minimal of 
   dialogue (the film is in Italian with English subtitles) and a lot of 
   atmospheric visuals (running water seems to be the film's main 
   theme), as well as some graphic violence, but this is not a gore 
   film. While this film won't win any prizes, it is a perfectly 
   acceptable way to spend 91 minutes of your precious time. Also 
   featuring Alessio Bertoni, Lucio Zannella, Edo Basso and Fiorella 
   Petrozzi &amp; Marzia Ancora as the cursed twin sisters. <B>Not Rated</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

   (1983) -</B> Crazy-ass Italian/Spanish exploitation flick on the

    After an opening of stock footage of volcanos erupting and the 
   harsh, hard landscape turning into a lush forest, we see Adam (Mark 
   Gregory; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Nine90BronxWar1982">1990: 
   THE BRONX WARRIORS</A></B> - 1982) being born, fully grown, out of a 
   flesh-like cocoon (yet he still has a belly button!). Adam wanders 
   the land, having virgin experiences with everything, like lions and 
   other wild animals (he is friends with them, like Tarzan!) and 
   visiting the ocean for the very first time, where he is a natural 
   born swimmer. Adam soon becomes lonely, so he creates a version of a 
   woman in the sand (How the fuck does he know what a woman looks 
   like???) and protects it when the rain threatens to wash it away. He 
   jumps on top of his sand castle woman and as the rain dissolves his 
   creation, the sand washes away, but there is a live woman underneath 
   him, Eve (Andrea Goldman; in her only film). They walk around naked 
   in their huge Garden of Eden (only showing both male and female 
   full-frontal nudity in long shots), swimming in the lake (with a 
   beautiful waterfall, a location used in many Italian jungle films) 
   and generally having the time of their lives, but a hissing snake 
   tempts Eve to take a bite of the sweet apple. Eve is tired of eating 
   berries and dates, so she reaches for the apple, but Adam stops her, 
   saying it is forbidden (Suddenly, they speak perfect Italian!). Eve 
   tries to stay away from the apple, but the snake keeps egging her on 
   until temptation takes over and she takes a bite of the apple, 
   handing it to Adam, who also takes a bite out of it. Adam, who sees a 
   lion screwing a tiger from behind, gets the idea of doing the same 
   thing to Eve, so he takes her from behind and she likes it! Then, 
   they are swept out of the Garden of Eden and forced to live off the 
   land, no more garden, no more food (And the film never tells us who 
   forced them out of the Garden, but that is something we should all know).</FONT></FONT><BR>

   dinosaurs, just like The Flintstones!), which Adam kills by forcing 
   its jaws open (hilarious in the way it's portrayed, but there is a 
   much funnier scene to come), our biblical twosome meet a clan of 
   post-cavemen (When they see that this clan is wearing clothes that 
   cover their privates, Adam and Eve suddenly become bashful in their 
   nakedness and put on clothes so small, it barely covers their private 
   parts). They almost get into a fight (A couple of male clan members 
   hold Adam, while their leader grabs his dick!), but Adam wants to 
   look for the sea, because he believes that is where he and Eve 
   belong. Eve doesn't want to go, so Adam heads out alone, Eve becoming 
   friendly with a male member of the tribe that the credits list as 
   &quot;Bearkiller&quot; (&Aacute;ngel Alc&aacute;zar). Eve and 
   Bearkiller become close (if you know what I mean), but Adam gets 
   lonely and heads back to Eve. When he gets back, Adam becomes jealous 
   when he sees his woman with another man (Ah, so this is where 
   jealously came from!). Eve indoctrinates Bearkiller on the joys of 
   bathing and while he is washing the green paint off his body, a bear 
   appears (When I tell you this is the worst bear costume I have ever 
   saw, believe it!) and Adam watches as Bearkiller (So that how he got 
   his name!) kills the bear with his trusty club. Then a clan of 
   neanderthal cannibals attack Bearkiller's clan, killing a female 
   member and eating her, while Adam uses his new club to kill a couple 
   of cannibals and save Bearkiller's clan. Eve grows tired of 
   Bearkiller (Just like a woman) and goes back with Adam. They search 
   for their place by the sea, but it is a long and arduous journey, as 
   they go hungry and are attacked by a pack of wolves, but they 
   persevere and find their place by the sea when the frozen ground 
   beneath them melts, showing them that they have reached their 
   destination. Eve tells Adam that she is not felling well, not knowing 
   that she is actually pregnant. The film ends with Eve giving birth to 
   a son while she squats in the sea, Adam holding his son up to the 
   sun. The rest is history.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This entertaining, yet perverse film only proves to me how 
   ridiculous the Bible is. While this film exploits everything in that 
   book, it only shows us that our belief in immaculate creation is 
   nothing but a lie (That's all I am going to say about religion). The 
   film is wonderful to look at, as the locations are beautiful and 
   hazardous, sometimes at the same time. Too bad I can't say the same 
   thing about Mark Gregory, because he has a look on his face all the 
   time that will remind you of someone crapping their pants! Andrea 
   Goldman is easy on the eyes, but there a reason she never made 
   another film. She's a horrible actress. It took two directors to make 
   this hoary mess, Enzo Doria (as &quot;Vincent Green&quot;) and Luigi 
   Russo (as &quot;John Wilder&quot;), who both directed the <B>BLUE LAGOON</B> 
   rip-off <B><A HREF="blue_island_1982.htm">BLUE ISLAND</A></B> (1982), 
   and seven screenwriters (I'm not going to mention them, to protect 
   their guilt) to bastardize the Good Book. This film isn't a total 
   write-off, as it has more that a few sequences that will make you 
   laugh out loud (And, just like most Italian jungle films, it contains 
   footage of real life animal death). Surprisingly, most of the animal 
   footage is not stock, as we can plainly see Mark Gregory petting 
   lions, cougars and other wild animals (yet wolves attack him!).

   more is the fact that this film was sometimes shown on TV (usually

   the forest next to a secluded town. It seems the spacecraft was some

   Kathy asks a priest (Philip Baker Hall) to bless the house. We all 
   know what happens next: Flies and more flies as the house tells the 
   priest, &quot;Get OUT!&quot; While offering nothing new to the 
   Amityville legend (besides the addition of a boathouse in the 
   backyard), the remake offers plenty of scares and thrills (including 
   a tense rooftop rescue). Since one of the producers is Michael Bay 
   (who did the same on <B><A HREF="texas_chainsaw_massacre_2003.htm">THE
    TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE</A></B> remake in 2003), expect plenty of 
   quick-cutting and loud soundtrack jumps. Director Andrew Douglas (a 
   TV commercial director before this) actually keeps Ryan Reynolds' 
   performance restrained, as he has no sarcastic wisecracks to spout 
   here like most of the films he's been in (especially <B><A HREF="blade_trinity_2004.htm">BLADE:
    TRINITY</A></B> - 2004). Reynolds is actually quite good here as a 
   man drifting into a psychotic rage he tries so hard to control. I've 
   seen a lot worse than this, so give it a chance when you have the 
   time. Besides, it's only 89 minutes long, a full 30 minutes shorter 
   than the original (which I always thought could have used some 
   trimming anyway). Also starring Jesse James, Jimmy Bennett, Chloe

   him that he doesn't know where Jeanette is and the Commissioner

   and his lumberjack crew have just called it a day and are ready for 
   dinner, where Elmer the Cook (Alan Tuskes) is roasting a huge ox over 
   a fire pit. Bill needs to take a shit before he eats, so he leaves 
   for the forest without his axe. When he returns, he finds his entire 
   crew and the other hired crew have been slaughtered, their heads and 
   other body parts bloodily dismembered. A slightly tall man with a 
   monstrous face appears and chases Bill into the log-sawing shack. 
   Bill first loses an arm from the large round spinning blade and then 
   he gets cut in half through the middle of his skull. Cut to the 
   present at the Minnesota Department of Corrections, where Ms. K 
   (Kristina Kopf) and the gruff Sgt. Hoke (Tom Downey) are running the 
   &quot;First Offender Program&quot;, where teens and young adults like

   Tanner (Tim Lovelace), have to survive a week in the Minnesota forest

   driving is drunk driving&quot; is what those commercials say over and 
   over) and a man ran a red light and smacked into her car. A man with

    Daddy was powerless to do anything, because he was overruled at the 
   State level. So she took the plea deal and is now in this program. 
   People will thank her for that. Once everyone is in the forest (where 
   Sgt. Hoke treats them like they are in the the military while he 
   enjoys fine cigars and booze in his cabin), everyone meets Meeks (Joe 
   Estevez, who can do this kind of role blindfolded), who tells them 
   that there is death waiting for them the deeper they go into the 
   forest, but Sgt. Hoke tells everyone he is crazy. Not as crazy as 
   Sgt. Hoke thinks. On one of their grueling hikes, the giant Paul 
   Bunyan (Chris Hahn, who is rendered in CGI, forced perspective and 
   miniature sets) appears behind Trish and uses his trusty giant axe to 
   split her in half vertically and the cuts Sgt. Hoke in half through 
   his stomach, stepping Sgt. Hoke's upper torso when he won't shut up 
   about killing him (both deaths are highly graphic). Rosa is injured 
   by a giant flying branch, so everyone still left alive holes-up in a 
   cabin, while Paul Bunyan drags their van away (&quot;There goes our 
   only ride, man!&quot;). Meeks joins the group and tells them the real 
   story about Paul Bunyan. When he was born, he was unusually large and 
   doctors gave him a slim chance to live. His face was especially 
   deformed from the delivery. Meeks tells the group that Bunyan is so 
   angry because Zack stole one of Babe The Blue Ox's horns and he wants 
   it back. If they place it at the shrine he created for his only one 
   true friend, Paul Bunyon will probably leave them alone. Zack goes 
   outside and throws the horn into the woods, screaming that the giant 
   can leave them alone now, but the horn comes flying back and impales 
   Zack through his stomach and Paul Bunyan drags Zack away screaming. 
   Meeks continues his story of Paul Bunyan (&quot;He's twice a big as 
   the normal man and lives three times as long!&quot;) and we see in 
   flashback Foreman Bill kill Babe and then hand him over to Elmer the 
   Cook to make dinner out of. Paul Bunyan (who is already six foot high 
   and just a teenager of 13) is enraged and goes on a murder spree (we 
   get to see him cut heads and appendages off where we only saw the 
   aftermath in the beginning of the film, thanks to Robert Kurtzman's 
   Creature Corps), ending in Foreman Bill's death. The people in town 
   capture him and drag him through town (the two men who drag him are 
   Robert Kurtzman and director Gary Jones), where people spit on him 
   and the girl he was sweet on, Mel (Donna Williams), turns her back on 
   him (She could overlook his ugliness, but not murder). He is thrown 
   into a mine shaft and the entrance sealed with dynamite. Bunyan 
   eventually escaped and headed for the high country, where he built a 
   shrine to Babe and grew and grew and grew. He really never bothered 
   anyone (We watch him kill a bear in the beginning of the film when 
   the bear goes to kill a deer, so he lives off the land) and has kept 
   to himself, but the desecration of Babe's shrine by Zack has turned 
   him into a wild man once again. Ms. K and the rest of the kids are 
   still in big trouble from Paul Bunyan's vengeance. Can Sheriff Tanner 
   save them in time? CB is in the most danger because she is the 
   spitting image of Paul's old flame Mel and Bunyan attacks the cabin, 
   using his axe to chop a hole into the cabin's roof. He grabs Rosa, 
   but when he gets a good look at her and sees it is not CB, Bunyan 
   throws her through the air like a ragdoll, where she hits a tree and 
   dies. Ms. K uses Sgt. Hoke's pistol and shoots Bunyan in the eye and 
   Sheriff Tanner shows up, puts a few rifle shots into Bunyan and he 
   falls back into the shack (a very good use of miniature sets and 
   forced perspective). Meeks, carrying a shotgun, refuses to let anyone 
   leave, because he does not want the town to know that Paul Bunyan is 
   real. Marty goes to grab the shotgun away from Meeks and gets shot in 
   the chest and dies. I guess Paul Bunyan doesn't feel the same way 
   about Meeks, because he throws the giant axe and decapitates him 
   (another very well done scene, where Meek's rolling head ends up in 
   front of the camera). The last three remaining survivors jump into 
   Sheriff Tanner's truck, where CB drives while her father shoots at 
   Paul Bunyan. who is chasing the truck. CB eventually crashes the 
   truck (Was she buzzed?), so the three head for a small bridge with 
   Bunyan not far behind. The door to the other side of the bridge is 
   locked and gunfire won't open it, but a posse who heard the Sheriff's 
   call for help earlier in the film show up and put a whole lot of 
   gunfire into Bunyan's body (pretty good scene). Before Bunyan dies, 
   he looks at CB and says &quot;Mel! Mel!&quot; and falls off the 
   bridge to the river below. All we see is one huge blood puddle. Is 
   this the end of Paul Bunyan (it isn't if you read the final words in 
   the end credits)? The posse carry Paul Bunyon's giant axe away as 
   proof and Sheriff Tanner, CB and Ms. K have a story to tell for 
   generations to come. And remember: &quot;No critters were harmed in 
   the making of this film.&quot;&nbsp; This film made its debut on the 
   SyFy Network, but in severely edited form. There are scenes of 
   topless female nudity, foul language and plenty of bloody gore that

   some are &quot;goosed&quot; with CGI), which makes a world of

   The story adds-on to the real-life incidents in 2009, where millions 
   of dead fish washed ashore and flocks of birds dropped dead in 
   mid-air all over the world. The film starts in 2012, where reporter

   something she witnessed as a novice fluff story TV <A HREF="bay_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/bay 2012 poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>reporter
    in the coastal town of Claridge, Maryland on July 4, 2009 (actually 
   filmed in Georgetown, South Carolina). The town is enjoying it's 
   tourist-packed July 4th celebration when people start breaking out in 
   disgusting boils, bleeding profusely from every orifice and finally 
   dying after something eats its way from the inside-out of their 
   bodies. Footage taken by a couple of oceanographers and an 
   eco-terrorist a month earlier show that the bay is severly polluted, 
   probably because a huge chicken farm in the vicinity is dumping tons 
   and tons of chicken shit directly into the water (the shit contains 
   steroids used to feed the chickens so they grow faster). The 
   oceanographers discover an unknown parasite is infecting the fish, 
   sometimes growing to fist size in a record amount of time. Mayor John 
   Stockman (Frank Deal) knows all about it, but refused to report it to 
   higher authorities in fear that it will destroy their tourism 
   business (reminicent of <B><A HREF="jaws_1975.htm">JAWS</A></B> - 
   1975). He did the same thing two years earlier when the local nuclear 
   power plant had an accident and radioactive waste seeped into the bay 
   and local artesian wells. To make matters worse, the Mayor built a 
   desalinization plant, which turns the bay's salt water into fresh 
   drinking water. Now it has all come back to bite him in the ass. 
   People begin dropping like flies, quickly filling up the town's 
   hospital. Dr. Jack Abrams (Stephen Kunken) sees the rapidly spreading 
   boils, is forced to amputate limbs and contacts the Center For 
   Disease Control, who prove as useful as tits on a rock. As the 
   outbreak progresses, the parasites begin biting out people's tongues 
   and bursting out of every part of their bodies, while Donna and her 
   cameraman document what is going on outside. What follows next is not 
   for the faint of heart. Even though the ending is a little too pat, 
   director Levinson mostly stays away from the &quot;shakey cam&quot; 
   syndrome, relying instead on a professional news cameraman, 
   stationary cameras throughout the town, police car dashboard cameras 
   and Skype conversations on computers to document the carnage. There 
   are a few jump-out-of-your-seat moments as well and the gore and 
   blood scenes are very well done and plentiful (even the CGI parasites 
   are seamless). Hey, I'll now admit that not all found footage films 
   are bad (I also liked <B><A HREF="chronicle_2012.htm">CHRONICLE</A></B>

   telling Jessica they should have remained in New York City. Dick 
   wants to explore Brazil's black magic culture, especially the Macumba

    Instead of worrying about her brother being alone in a dangerous 
   city (Wait until you hear her excuse why later in the film! I'm not 
   going to tell you what it is because I would be depriving you of some fucked-up
    familial enjoyment), Jessica and Kevin go back to their hotel and 
   make love! Dick walks around the city, stopping to watch some 
   children performing some strange ritual in the street. Dick notices a 
   painted seashell by his feet and he picks it up. The children 
   immediately stop their ritual and stare at Dick, as if he has done 
   something wrong, and then run away. Suddenly, Dick notices the 
   streets are completely empty of people and realizes he is lost, with 
   no idea how to get back to the hotel. He starts running and notices a 
   blind man (Justo Silva) with pure white eyes (no pupils) sitting on a 
   blanket containing a human skull, some black candles and other black 
   magic paraphernalia. Dick is drawn to the strange necklace this man 
   is wearing. A local woman (Clea Simoes; <B><A HREF="macumba_love_1960.htm">MACUMBA
    LOVE</A></B> - 1960) taps him on the shoulder and tells Dick that 
   the blind man is a Macumba witchdoctor. Dick wants to see him perform 
   a Macumba ritual, but the woman tells him to go away because he is 
   not &quot;purified&quot; and the ritual could have deadly 
   consequences for anyone not initiated in the religion. Dick tells the 
   woman that he was initiated by a Macumba priest in New York City and 
   demands to take part in the ceremony. The woman tells Dick to be at 
   the statue of Christ the Redeemer at sunset and she will take him to 
   the ceremony. This is the beginning of a supernatural journey for 
   Dick, Jessica and Kevin that involves a group of zombie slaves who 
   were mistreated and killed by their owner and have spent the better 
   part of two centuries lost in limbo. These zombie slaves' only 
   purpose is to rip apart and kill any white person they cross paths with.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Back at the hotel, Kevin gets a phone call while in bed with 
   Jessica, but all he hears on the other end is a man scream (the 
   meaning of this is never explained). Jessica finally says that she is 
   worried about her brother; he has been away for two days and she 
   hasn't heard from him, not even a phone call. We are then at the 
   Macumba ceremony, where the woman has Dick blindfolded so he doesn't 
   know the location of the ritual. Dick watches the witchdoctor behead 
   a live rooster and one of the female dancers drinks the rooster's 
   blood directly from its neck stump. The witchdoctor gives Dick his 
   necklace and when he drinks from a ceremonial goblet, he passes out. 
   Dick wakes up in his hotel room the next morning, no idea how he got 
   there. Jessica and Kevin tell him they have to go on a small trip and 
   Dick joins them. The Jeep breaks down in the middle of nowhere, when 
   the trio meets Jose (Philip Murray) and Sonia (Juliana Teixeira), two 
   rich young people who offer them to spend the night at their 
   plantation. Their housekeeper, Maria (Maria Alves), notices Dick's 
   necklace and become unhinged, performing secret rituals in her room 
   with black candles. That night, Dick walks out of his guests' opulent 
   plantation in a trance and ends up in a cemetery in the jungle 
   (Notice the headstones have no names on them, just numbers. An old 
   practice used in slave graveyards). Dick plays a recording of a 
   Macumba ceremony on his Sony Walkman (I guess he recorded the 
   witchdoctor's ceremony) and the ground around the headstones begin to 
   burn, while the headstones bleed. Suddenly, hands burst out of the 
   ground and a group of zombies (there&nbsp; are six of them, each 
   zombie having an item that differentiates them from the rest [hook, 
   axe, knife, pitchfork, etc.]) begin attacking the plantation, killing 
   off the residents and guests one-by-one.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The first to die is Sonia, as the zombie with a hook uses it to poke 
   out her right eye (the first instance of graphic violence). Hook 
   Zombie pokes out Maria's left eye while she begs for her life and Axe 
   Zombie plants his instrument into her skull. Knife Zombie stabs Jose 
   in the arm, but Kevin saves him from certain death. Kevin goes 
   looking for Maria, finding her hanging by her neck, her eye hanging 
   out of its socket and lit candles in the shape of a crucifix directly 
   underneath her hanging body. Jose tells Kevin and Jessica that this 
   will all end and the zombies will return to their graves when they 
   kill six white people, yet Kevin and Jessica still refuse to believe 
   in zombies, Jessica using the 21st Century excuse again. When Kevin 
   finds Dick in a trance and brings him back to the plantation, 
   everyone decides to leave, but Dick, once again, disappears. Jessica 
   finds Dick in the cemetery and notices six old coffins are empty. She 
   now believes in zombies, so everyone jumps in Kevin's Jeep (when did 
   they have the time to get it fixed???) and drive off to the nearest village.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Keith stupidly drives off the road and the Jeep gets stuck in the 
   dirt (C'mon now. A 4-wheel drive Jeep stuck in dirt???). While Kevin 
   and Jessica try to find someone to help them pull the Jeep out of the 
   dirt, Jose notices Dick's necklace, so Dick pulls out a switchblade 
   and cuts Jose's throat! Dick then tells for help and tells Jessica 
   and Kevin that a zombie killed Jose, but Jessica notices Dick's 
   necklace is in Jose's dead hand. Dick also slices all the tires on 
   the Jeep, forcing the trio to hoof it back to the plantation and 
   barricade themselves inside. A possessed Dick (living up to his name) 
   chases Jessica through the house with an axe while Kevin throws 
   Molotov cocktails at the zombies. Dick chops through a door to get to 
   Jessica (doing his best Jack Nicholson imitation). Jessica escapes 
   and Kevin kills both Knife and Hook Zombies with fire. Pitchfork 
   Zombie kills Dick by impaling him in the stomach and then goes after 
   Jessica, but Kevin saves her by setting fire to the rest of the 
   zombies. As they drive away (Where in the hell did they get 
   tires???), they pass the same children Dick saw performing a ritual,

    COBRA 4</A></B> - 1991), this still has a long way to go for me to 
   even mention the word &quot;good&quot;. Horribly acted by a cast of 
   unknown actors &amp; Brazil locals and sloppily paced (most of these 
   films are), it takes nearly an hour for the zombies to appear and the 
   infrequent gore to happen, while Dick walks around with the same 
   dazed look on his face. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be that 
   way in the film or whether he's just a bad actor, but it makes no 
   difference, because all the characters are nothing but horror film 
   clich&eacute;s, doing the stupidest things possible at the most 
   inopportune times (screenplay by Olga Pehar; The <B><A HREF="karate_warrior_sequels_1988-1993.htm">KARATE
    WARRIOR</A></B> series [1988-1993]; who was Lenzi's wife). The 
   character of Jose is supposed to come across as a hard-ass who treats 
   the help (Maria) badly, even hitting her, but when he loses his 
   temper, he comes across as a teen having a conniption fit or going 
   into a jealous rage. He's about as dangerous as a baby with a 
   grenade. I would also venture to say that this film is somewhat 
   racist, especially the way it displays the zombie slaves, especially 
   the black zombie with a noose around his neck and all of them have 
   their legs shackled, forcing them to shuffle, something that would 
   send Civil Rights leaders into a state of rage if the film were to be 
   made today. For 200-year-old zombies, they are very well preserved, 
   hardly any decomposing skin on their bodies (just some brown oatmeal 
   on their faces and nowhere else). And why are there no female 
   zombies? Surely they must have been abused, too? All I can say about 
   this film is that if you have nothing better to do (like trimming 
   your nose hairs with a weed whacker), you may want to give this film 
   a look. It's not a recommendation, just an idea. It is Lenzi after all.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   hitchhiker is killed (his eyes are ripped out) and Will escapes with 
   a black crystal that the hitchhiker had in his possession. The 
   hitchhiker mentioned a girl named Daphne who happens to live in the 
   same town as Will's brother Pete. The townspeople warn Will to stay 
   away from Daphne (Lily Brown), but he doesn't listen.&nbsp; Daphne is 
   a witch and the black crystal is a power source wanted by cult leader 
   Daniel (Mark Lang) that will channel all the evil energy of the 
   world. Will and Daphne fall in love and Daphne gets Will out of a 
   couple of scrapes with the locals by killing them with her powers. 
   When Pete dies after trying to run Daphne out of town, the cult 
   leader and his henchmen kidnap Will and Daphne. While Daphne takes 
   Daniel to the crystal Will escapes. The chase is on as we find out 
   that Daphne and Daniel were once lovers and they are immortals. Will 
   begins to wipe out the cult members one-by-one until only he and 
   Daniel are left. (As Will pumps bullets into Daniel's chest, he says: 
   &quot;You are becoming a real pimple on my ass!&quot;) Who will 
   survive? Will Will and Daphne find true love? Who gives a flying 
   fuck? This is a lazily-filmed piece of junk that contains atrocious 
   acting, bad dialogue (&quot;You filthy son of a whore!), a snail-like 
   pace (at 70 minutes, it seems twice as long), terrible effects and a 
   budget that would probably buy you breakfast at your local IHOP. 
   Avoid this one like the plague. It shouldn't be too hard, since no 
   one really has heard of this film before it was listed on the 
   Internet Movie Database!&nbsp; The end credits list the title as <B>THE

   I really wanted to like this Italy/West Germany co-production since 
   it was directed by one of my favorite Italian directors and has a 
   top-notch cast, but the truth is that this quasi-Giallo plays more 
   like a shopworn B-level Hitchcockian thriller and the screenplay is 
   full of nothing but clich&eacute;s. Still it's enjoyable for what it 
   is (just barely) thanks to the talented cast. The truth is this plays 
   more like a TV movie with added inserts of naked female breasts and 
   some foul language, but<A HREF="black_veil_for_lisa_1968.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/black veil for lisa poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>

    The film opens with the beautiful Lisa (Luciana Paluzzi; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#TragicCeremony1972">TRAGIC
    CEREMONY</A></B> - 1972) at a funeral, tears streaming down her eyes 
   as she watches someone being lowered in their newly-dug grave. Is 
   Lisa crying for this person or are her tears for another reason? The 
   film then switches over to someone dressed all in black (including 
   black hat and black gloves, a Giallo staple) following a man as he 
   walks out of a pub and then stabs him repeatedly in the back with a 
   switchblade, throwing the bloody knife and his gloves next to the 
   dead body. Shortly thereafter, Inspector Franz Bulon (John Mills; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#HumanFactor1975">THE
    &quot;HUMAN&quot; FACTOR</A></B> - 1975), the head of the Narcotics 
   Division of Interpol, arrives at the crime scene and is disappointed 
   that this man is dead. It seems the Inspector was looking for this 
   man to be a witness against a drug kingpin named Schoulmann, who has 
   been supplying cocaine and heroin to this unnamed German town (it 
   looks like Berlin). As a matter of fact, this is the third witness 
   against the drug kingpin to be killed in the same manner and The 
   Inspector's boss, Chief Ostermeyer (Tullio Altamura; <B><A HREF="danger_death_ray_1967.htm">DANGER!
    DEATH RAY</A></B> - 1967), is pressuring him to solve these cases as 
   quickly as possible. When Franz says he has to make a phone call, 
   everyone in the squad knows it will be to his new, much younger wife, 
   Lisa. You see, Lisa was picked up in a bust and was found innocent of 
   being a drug mule, so a much older Franz fell in love and married 
   her. Yet, he is obsessed with her cheating on him, checking up on her 
   every hour of every day until it becomes a severe case of domestic 
   stalking. When he phones her at home and gets no answer, he leaves 
   the crime scene and drives off for home without telling anyone. When 
   he gets home, he finds Lisa in bed, asking her why she didn't answer 
   the phone. She tells him she was sleeping, but he doesn't believe her 
   since the phone is right next to her bed. We then see that Franz and 
   Lisa do not share the same bed, even though they are married, as he 
   walks into his own bedroom, pours himself a glass of <A HREF="j&amp;b_scotch_whiskey_in_italian_films.htm#BlackVeilForLisa">J&amp;B
    Scotch</A> and struggles with his belief that Lisa is cheating on 
   him. Lisa then appears at the door of his bedroom in a sexy negligee 
   and they then make love (We see quick flashes of female breasts that 
   are obviously not Ms. Paluzzi's and look to have been added in 
   post-production to make the film more &quot;adult&quot;). It seems 
   that Lisa enjoys making Franz believe that she is being unfaithful. 
   She may deny it, but her words and actions dictate otherwise.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After another witness against Schoulmann is murdered in the same 
   fashion, we discover that the black-clad killer is handsome Max Lindt 
   (Robert Hoffmann; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Spasmo">SPASMO</A></B> - 
   1974), who was hired by the drug kingpin to dispose all of the 
   potential witnesses. It seems Max dropped his lucky charm, a silver 
   dollar with a bullet in the middle of it, at the latest crime scene 
   and Franz has found it, put it in his pocket and has not told anyone 
   he has it. When Lisa tells Franz that she is going out to dinner with 
   a girlfriend, he goes to the restaurant to make sure she is telling 
   the truth, but she is not there. A woman working the front desk tells 
   Franz that someone looking like Lisa came into the restaurant and 
   sudenly left in a red Porsche. A furious Franz waits at home for Lisa 
   to arrive and tells her about seeing her leave in a red Porsche, but 
   she tells him it's her girlfriend's car and they decided to have 
   dinner at her girlfriend's house because the restaurant was too busy. 
   She tells Franz that since he doesn't trust her, that the next time 
   she will find a lover and screw him. Franz slaps her hard across the 
   face and Lisa runs to her bedroom crying. The next morning, Franz 
   asks one of his detectives to see if Lisa's girlfriend actually owns 
   a red Porsche. With the help of the lucky charm and his informer, 
   newspaper stand vendor Rabbit (Giuseppe Terrranova; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Torso1973">TORSO</A></B> 
   - 1973), who tells Franz that there is a lot of talk on the street 
   about &quot;tulips&quot;, the Inspector captures Max and places him 
   handcuffed in his car (Rabbit is then run over by a truck and killed 
   [offscreen] for informing to the Inspector).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As Franz is driving Max to headquarters, he sees Lisa running down 
   the street and getting into a red Porsche. He follows her and then 
   stops his car after his mind gets the better of him (seeing Lisa 
   naked and making love to another man). He offers to let Max go free 
   if he will do one thing for him: kill Lisa and make it look like the 
   other murders he committed. What happens next is best for you, my 
   dear readers to discover, especially when Franz discovers that Lisa's 
   girlfriend actually owns a red Porsche and he tries to get Max to 
   call off the hit. He needn't worry about that because Max has fallen 
   in love with Lisa, they make love and he has no intention of killing 
   her, even though Schoulmann's goons beat<A HREF="black_veil_for_lisa_1968.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/black veil for lisa italy poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   him up and tell him to stay away from Lisa. Needless to say, the film 
   ends where it began, with Lisa standing next to freshly dug grave at 
   a cemetery and crying. We then discover why and it's not much of a 
   surprise, at least to me.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   screenplay, by Dallamano, Giuseppe Belli (his only screenplay 
   credit), Vittoriano Petrilli (<B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#RunPsychoRun1968">RUN,

    OF THE CANNIBALS</A></B> - 1970), is the result of too many cooks 
   spoiling the meal. The fact is there are very few surprises to be 
   found in the film, which is a cardinal sin in a mystery thriller such 
   as this. While watching this, all the future plot points were 
   telegraphed long before they happened and I wasn't wrong guessing 
   them one hundred percent of the time. Maybe I have watched too many 
   of these films, but this one offered nothing new to me, except for 
   the fine performances by John Mills, Luciana Paluzzi and, especially, 
   Robert Hoffmann, who has never been better than he is here. Hey, not 
   every film can be a winner, but since this came from Dallamano, it is 
   a bitter disappointment to me. It could have been so much better if 
   the screenplay was fine tuned a little more and the clich&eacute;s 
   tossed aside, giving us a better mystery.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   investigate, finding Alice holding a hypodermic needle and about to 
   inject a man with burned skin, with blood on his hands. Alice passes 
   out and falls into Roderic's arms. When she wakes up, she tells 
   Roderic what she saw, but Roderic tells her she must have had a 
   nightmare. she leads him to the tower, but the room is now empty. 
   Roderic starts a romantic relationship with Alice, telling her that 
   her brother is beneath Emilie (John is in love with Emilie), because 
   &quot;noble blood&quot; flows through her veins. Roderic tells Doctor 
   LaRouche that he is going to tell Emilie and Alice 
   &quot;everything&quot; and walks upstairs and says, &quot;Emilie, you 
   must prepare yourself for something unpleasant.&quot; He goes on to 
   say that their father is not dead and apologises to alice for 
   deceiving her last night. Their father became horribly disfigured in 
   a fire at the castle's abby. The man Alice saw with Eleonore&nbsp;

   headstone in the family tomb there is an old prophecy that only a 
   warped and distorted mind can believe in&quot;, says Roderic. He 
   continues, &quot;It says that the House of De Blancheville will end 
   with this generation if a female descendent reaches the age of 21. 
   Father will do anything to carry out this prophecy and that's why he 
   wants to kill you Emilie!&quot; Roderic assures Emilie that he will 
   watch over her and not to worry, but it is plain to see that she is 
   in danger. That night, her father comes into Emilie's bedroom and 
   hypnotizes her. She sleepwalks in a trance to the abby, with her 
   disfigured father following her. &quot;Your tomb, Emilie, your tomb! 
   Enter to your death!&quot; says her father, but Roderic and Doctor 
   LaRouche save her in the nick of time. Is this disfigured man 
   actually her father or is something more sinister going on?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   before cable became commonplace. It is also available in widescreen

   haunt me from my childhood. Also starring Emily Wolkowicz (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WhatDoneSolange1972">WHAT

    rendition of &quot;Pop Goes The Weasel&quot; on the soundtrack and a 
   blood and gore-drenched finale. The films' slight and ridiculous 
   story line involves a female psychiatrist driving a handful of her 
   patients to the middle of the California desert for a group 
   &quot;confrontational&quot; therapy session. All the patients have a 
   certain stereotypical problem (disturbed Vietnam vet, nymphomaniac, 
   lesbian, alcoholic, etc..). An unknown assailant starts to dispatch 
   the patients to the tune of &quot;Pop&quot; in various bloody ways. 
   Sliced throats are a specialty. Nothing new in that department, 
   right? The acting ranges from good to sub-par and the scenery gets 
   tedious after a while. The film is fairly bloody throughout and it 
   really begins to flow in the last 10 minutes, even if deja vu sets in

   micro-budgeted horror film because it tries to be different. It is 
   just as interested in the Bondage Sadomasochistic (BDSM) lifestyle as 
   it is in horror. A troubled Crime Scene Photographer named Daniel 
   (Vincent Bilancio, also a Producer) spots a very small hand print at 
   a murder scene involving a BDSM couple ripped apart with body pieces 
   missing. His <A HREF="blood_gnome_2003.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/blood gnome dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="95" HEIGHT="140" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>assistant
    accidentally has his Sony Handycam set in nightvision mode and 
   Daniel spots a small creature (who is invisible to the naked eye) in 
   the viewing screen. Of, course no one believes him so he goes to a 
   bondage mistress Divinity (Mellissa Pursley) to help him understand 
   the BDSM lifestyle. This leads both of them to a bondage queen 
   Elandra (Ri Walton), who keeps a mother gnome in a box, whom she 
   feeds the missing body parts to. The mother gnome then gives birth to 
   baby gnomes who Elandra sticks with hypodermics and extracts a 
   hallucinogenic drug which she sells for big profits. Sensing that 
   Daniel is getting too close, Elantra sends her invisible gnomes to 
   kill him. Daniel bites one of the gnomes and tastes their blood, 
   thereby giving him the ability to see them. More murders of BDSM 
   couples ensue and Elantra manages to get her gnomes to implicate 
   Daniel in the murders. Daniel and Divinity must stop Elantra at a big 
   BDSM party, where Elantra plans on killing everyone and feeding them 
   to the mother gnome. The effects by Todd Rex range from laughable to 
   excellent and the screenplay by director John Lechago keeps the 
   viewer on their toes. The bloody body-ripping effects are very 
   well-done as the invisible gnomes (who are mostly seen as a blur) 
   slice and dice the tied-up victims. Bilancio (<B><A HREF="camp-blood_1999.htm">CAMP

   whacked-out back story) and scream queen Julie Strain and the

   gnomes themselves are just a cut above the <B><A HREF="ghoulies_1985.htm">GHOULIES</A></B>

    ZOMBIES</A><A NAME="BloodlustZombies11"></A> (2011) -</B> It seems 
   that everytime someone decides to direct their first feature, it 
   turns out to be a horror film. And for the past decade, most freshman 
   directors decide to make those horror films depicting zombies; a good 
   percentage of the films dealing with a bunch of infected people 
   killing the unaffected in a locked-down facility, not for the sake of 
   the story, but to keep costs down (the fewer the locations, the 
   cheaper and faster you can shoot it). That describes <B><A HREF="bloodlust_zombies_2011b.htm">BLOODLUST
    ZOMBIES</A></B> to a tee, with the only different thing about it 
   being that it stars bubble-butted porn actress Alexis Texas (who has 
   made an amazing 329 porn films between 2007 and 2014 and made her 
   share of <A HREF="alexis_texas_porn_tv_and_film_parodies_2006-2014.htm">TV
    and Film porn &quot;parodies&quot;</A>, a term the porn business 
   uses so the major studios can't sue them for copyright infringement). 
   Let me say this about Alexis Texas: as an actress, she makes a fine 
   naked female. In other words, she has no future in non-porn films 
   unless she starts taking acting lessons (Fred Olen Ray used her once 
   in <B><A HREF="bikini_frankenstein_2009.htm">BIKINI FRANKENSTEIN</A></B> 
   [2009] and hasn't worked with her since. Now that should tell you 
   something.). The film starts with two lab rats performing experiments 
   on cats with a new serum called &quot;BZ32&quot;. After giving the 
   cats shots of BZ32, one cat kills another. Their experiment turns 
   into a success, so at a late-night board meeting, president and<A HREF="bloodlust_zombies_2011.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/bloodlust zombies dvd9 front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   CEO Bobby Lee (Robert Heath) asks co-workers Judy Miller (Janice 
   Marie), Darren (Adam Danoff, this film's Co-Producer and Editor), 
   Catherine (Catherine White) and Executive Assistant Andrea (Alexis 
   Texas) to stay late so they can Skype the good news to their sister 
   company in another time zone. BZ32 is a hit. Well, it's a hit if you 
   take into consideration that it causes humans to become zombified 
   fighting machines (Bobby Lee plans on using this new serum/virus on 
   enemy soldiers so that they will kill each other [There are so many 
   holes in that logic to drive a train through. The first one being: 
   Who are the zombies going to chow-down on next when they eat all 
   their fellow soldiers? Wouldn't they go after us?]). We then see 
   Andrea and Bobby Lee playing &quot;hiding the sausage&quot; (I guess 
   when you can't act, you do what you know best), while Catherine is 
   bringing champagne to the two lab rats for a job well done. One of 
   the workers drops a test tube in the lab, but he says that it wasn't 
   one containing the BZ32 virus, yet the entire building goes into 
   lockdown just in case the threat is real. Catherine is attacked by 
   one of the infected cats and she, in turn, attacks the two lab 
   workers, turning them into the titled creatures. You guessed it: The 
   unaffected employees must now run and hide from the zombies (It is 
   impossible to leave or get into the building [Another huge hole in 
   the plot. Wouldn't some outside agency like the CDC be notified if 
   something like this happened? Or at least the local Police 
   Department?]). The zombies bite everyone they come into contact with 
   (We can imagine the special effects technician, just offscreen, 
   pushing the rubber bulb containing the fake blood and it comes out in 
   perfect streams. It seems every bite results in the same effect.), 
   while everyone else does the most idiotic things at the most 
   inopportune times. This is supposed to be a funny horror film, but 
   their idea of &quot;funny&quot; is Darren imagining all the women in 
   various states of undress when they ask him what he is thinking. 
   There is not an original thought in this film's tiny little brain 
   (they rip off &quot;The Girl From Ipanema&quot; elevator&nbsp; scene 
   from <B><A HREF="deep_rising_1998.htm">DEEP RISING</A></B> [1998] for 
   Christ's sake!). Darren even takes a camera photo of his penis to 
   prove to &quot;Libby The Temp&quot; (Lauren Todd) that he is not a 
   zombie, as they shoot guns at each other from a distance of about ten 
   feet (a joke badly ripped-off from <B><A HREF="naked_gun_1988.htm">THE
    NAKED GUN</A></B> - 1988). Alexis Texas proves to us that her 
   greatest assets are her bubble butt and her breasts, as her acting 
   reeks so bad, you can smell it coming out of your disc player. And 
   why do directors and producers always think that they can act in the 
   films they are making? Director/screenwriter/cinematographer/co-producer
    Dan Lantz (whose only other directorial effort is the gay-themed 
   thriller <B><A HREF="into_the_lions_den_2011.htm">INTO THE LION'S DEN</A></B> 
   - 2011) portrays a security guard that likes talking to himself and 
   keeps a closet full of automatic weapons. I really can't decide which 
   is worse: His direction or acting (In the DVD's blooper reel, Lantz 
   tells us that he isn't even in the film, so either he has a short 
   memory or is just trying to make us forget his bad acting). And 
   co-producer/editor Adam Danoff, who supplies most of the film's 
   &quot;comedy&quot;, is just simply terrible and unfunny. The basic 
   truth is that while there is plenty of violence, such as ears getting 
   bitten off, skin being bitten and pulled like string cheese, gunshots 
   to the head and axe attacks, Lantz and Danoff's screenplay is 
   juvenile at best and misogynistic at worst (I guess when you have a 
   porn &quot;actress&quot; starring in your film, you must think you 
   can get away with a lot more jokes at the expense of women). There 
   really is not one thing to recommend in this film, not even Alexis 
   Texas' nudity. If you want to see her nude and do much more, rent one 
   of her TV and movie porn parodies. I guarantee you will be a lot more 
   entertained than watching this poor excuse of a film. I have bits of 
   things in my stool that are more entertaining than this. Also 
   starring Sarah Dewey, Robb Stech, Justus White, Jim Bagwell, Jerry

   first watching this Georgia-lensed film when it was released on VHS 
   in the early 90's and being somewhat impressed with it. Today, I 
   wondered why it was never released on disc in the United States. 
   Thanks to Amazon Prime, I now know. It's awful. This horror/comedy is 
   about&nbsp; a southern hick named Jake (Danny Nelson; the 
   insufferable <B><A HREF="#Captured Alive">CAPTURED ALIVE</A></B> - 
   1995) who runs an illegal human organ black market. Jake has his son, 
   Hiram ( Christian Hesler) run people off the road with his Gran 
   Torino with a spiked front bumper (and the horn beeps 
   &quot;Dixie&quot;) and then Jake comes along with his tow truck and 
   tows them to his home, where he &quot;gasses&quot; them by putting a 
   rag over their mouth and nose, puts them in a barn full of his 
   earlier victims (including Elvis!) and removes their organs while 
   keeping them alive for future organ orders. His latest victims are 
   the Evans family. April Evans (Lori Birdsong; <B><A HREF="munchies_1987.htm">MUNCHIES</A></B> 
   - 1987) is participating in The Stonewall County Peach Festival 
   beauty contest, even though she is confined to a wheelchair due to a 
   &quot;virus&quot; in her spine (she plays a classical tune on a piano 
   while noticing Jake leering and drooling at the sight of her). Jake 
   takes an instant shine to her (he thinks he can &quot;fix&quot; her) 
   and has Hiram mess with the Evans' RV. Dad Clifford Evans (John 
   Saxon, who <A HREF="blood_salvage_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/blood salvage magnum vhs ad8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="218" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>looks
    embarrassed to be in this) tries to console April when she loses the 
   pageant, but as they are driving down the road, the front wheel of 
   the RV falls off and they skid off to the side of the road (Young son 
   Bobby [Andy Greenway] says, &quot;Cool! We just got into an 
   accident!&quot;). Along comes Jake and his tow truck and he takes the 
   RV and the entire Evans family, including mother Pat (Laura Whyte; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Scalpel">SCALPEL</A></B> 
   - 1977), back to his house, but April warns her father not to go 
   because she doesn't trust Jake. Clifford should have listened, 
   because when they get to Jakes house, Bobby goes exploring and thinks 
   a live alligator that Jake keeps on the property is a dog! Bobby is 
   soon gassed and put in the barn. Soon Dad And Mom turn out to be 
   victims, but April stays in the RV armed with a shotgun. When she 
   runs out of shotgun shells, Jake takes her to the bedroom of his dead 
   wife, taking her wheelchair away. Jake's retarded son, the fat and 
   hulking Roy (Ralph Pruitt Vaughn, who walks around with a headless 
   talking doll that says &quot;I love you&quot;!), takes an instant 
   shine to April, but Jake warns him to keep away from April because 
   she is his. We see Jake take a long hypodermic needle to Bobby's back 
   and drain him of spinal fluid. Jake uses it to make his own special 
   serum, &quot;gasses&quot; April and injects it into her back. Yep, 
   April can now walk. We then see Mr. Stone (the late Ray Walston; <B><A HREF="my_favorite_martian_tv_series_1963-1966.htm">MY
    FAVORITE MARTIAN</A></B> - 1963-1966, who looks equally embarrassed) 
   follow Jake into the barn and looks at Clifford's body. Mr Stone buys 
   human organs for the black market and wants Clifford's kidneys as 
   well as mom Pat's eyes. Jake makes a deal with him and Mr. Stone 
   leaves and says he will return in a couple of days to collect the 
   organs, but complains about the alligator walking freely on the 
   property. April tries unsuccessfully a couple of times to escape from 
   her room, so an agitated Jake puts her in his room. (It has a metal 
   door that can't be unhinged or unlocked without the key. We also 
   learn that he keeps the rotting corpse of his wife in his bed!). 
   April tempts Roy to come into the room so she can read a child's book 
   to him and he enters; April hits him over the head with a heavy 
   object and kills him. Jake discovers his body when April escapes (she 
   kills the alligator by leading it into the back end of a garbage 
   truck and crushing it to death, but there are plenty of alligator 
   eggs hatching in an abandoned car, as April discovers when she tries 
   to hide). Jake has had it with April's behavior and decides to use 
   her as an organ donor. As he is about to put a scalpel to her back, 
   April picks up an oil lamp and throws it onto Jake, setting him on 
   fire. She finds her mother, who has had her eyes removed and they 
   take off in the RV that Jake fixed. Hiram is now pissed-off and tries 
   to run them off the road with his Torino, but April leads him to a 
   logging truck stopped on the road and Jake crashes into the truck, a 
   log taking his head off and the car exploding. As mom dies in the 
   back of the RV, we see that a severly-burned Jake has been hiding in 
   the RV and he heads towards a driving April. She slams on the brakes 
   and Jake goes flying through the front window (By the looks of it, 
   there is no such thing as safety glass on RVs!). April runs over his 
   body with the RV and continues on her way. The film ends with a not 
   quite dead Roy, picking up Jake's crushed body and driving off in the 
   tow truck, Hiram's Torino on the hook. Roy thinks he can fix both of 
   them.&nbsp; Horrendously acted by nearly everyone in the cast 
   (especially Birdsong as April, who screams out most of her lines), 
   this film was partially financed by boxer Evander Holyfield (probably 
   for tax shelter purposes), who gets an Executive Producer credit and 
   makes a cameo as a boxer at a carnival, where the barker (boxing 
   trainer great Lou Duva) challenge anyone in the audience to knock out 
   a blindfolded Holyfield, so Hiram decides to try, only to get his 
   lights knocked out. While the acting is abysmal, even more disgusting 
   is the tone of the film, such as when the ultra-religious Jake wants 
   to make April his bride and Hiram threatens to rape her several 
   times. Director/co-screenwriter Tucker Johnston never directed 
   another film again, but he did co-author the screenplay to director 
   Gregory Dark's <B><A HREF="secret_games_3_1994.htm">SECRET GAMES 3</A></B>

   found success producing movies for Lifetime, such as <B><A HREF="psycho_in_law_2017.htm">PSYCHO
    IN-LAW</A></B> (2017). So many good opportunities are missed in this 
   film (such as putting some light on the inside of the barn so we 
   could get a good look at the organ donors; one who even looks like 
   Yoko Ono!) and it is not as gory as it sounds. Both John Saxon and 
   Ray Walston must have owed someone a big favor because they do not 
   belong in such an unprofessional film as this. Some critic compared

   the critic must have been viewing a different film than what I saw. 
   This film couldn't lick TCM's meathooks.&nbsp; The boom mike makes a 
   lot of appearances in this film, especially the scenes filmed in 
   Jake's house, but that is probably because it is an unmatted 
   Fullscreen print. If it were OAR, I am sure the mike would be no 
   where to be seen. And to think I liked this film based on the first

   Continuing with my reviews of childhood films that fell into the 
   Public Domain (PD) comes this modern (at least in 1965) gothic horror 
   film with a maniacal performance by Mickey Hargitay (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LadyFrankenstein">LADY

    In medieval times, the Crimson Executioner is sentenced to death for 
   torturing and killing countless victims of his wrath.&nbsp; He is put 
   in an Iron Maiden (No, not the heavy<A HREF="bloody_pit_of_horror_1965.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/bloody pit of horror dvd8a front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="185" HEIGHT="252" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   metal band!), where the sharp spikes inside impale his body. The 
   device is then sealed with symbol that will damn his soul for all 
   eternity and it is put in his castle as a reminder to everyone of his 
   reign of evil. We are then in the present (at least in 1965), where 
   the &quot;Cover Girls&quot;, beautiful models all, are planning on 
   doing a photo shoot in the Crimson Executioner's castle. The models, 
   along with chaperone Rick (Walter Brandi; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#VampireBallerina60">THE
    VAMPIRE AND THE BALLERINA</A></B> - 1960), photographer Dermott 
   (Ralph Zucker; Producer of <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Kong Island">KONG
    ISLAND</A></B> - 1969 and <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Devil's wedding">THE
    DEVIL'S WEDDING NIGHT</A></B> - 1973), agent Daniel Parks (Alfredo 
   Rizzo; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#SSHellCamp1977">SS HELL CAMP</A></B> 
   - 1977), &quot;red shirts&quot; Perry (Nando Angelini; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#NakedYouDie">NAKED
    YOU DIE</A></B> - 1968) and Raoul (Albert Gordon), try to get in the 
   castle only to discover it is locked (they believe the castle is 
   empty). Perry climbs through a window and lets them in, where Cover 
   Girl Edith (Louise Barrett: <B><A HREF="superargo_and_the_faceless_giants_1968.htm">SUPERARGO
    AND THE FACELESS GIANTS</A></B> - 1968) tells everyone that she 
   senses evil in the castle.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That evil is Travis Anderson (Hargitay), who doesn't take too kindly 
   strangers invading his privacy. He tells Rick that they must all 
   leave immediately, but when he gets a look at Edith, he changes his 
   mind and tells them that they can stay for the night. Dermott takes 
   advantage of the situation and has the girls get changed for a photo 
   shoot. Perry and Raoul decide to tour the castle on their own and end 
   up in the castle's dungeon, where Perry trips, making an ancient Axe 
   fall off a wall, breaking the seal on the Iron Maiden (Uh oh!!!). 
   Dermott begins the photo shoot, where the Cover Girls pose in skimpy 
   clothing using the dungeon's torture devices as props (each shot 
   looks like a crime scene photo!). Suddenly, a spiked booby trap in 
   the dungeon falls on Perry's chest, killing him. The girls want to 
   quit and go home, but Daniel triples their salary and they continue 
   the photo shoot. Raoul and Suzy (Barbara Nelli; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#VengLadyMorgan1965">THE
    VENGEANCE OF LADY MORGAN</A></B> - 1965) are making out in the 
   dungeon when they are attacked by the Crimson Executioner (Hargitay 
   again), their fates not yet known. Like all castles, this one has 
   secret passageways and spy holes, where Travis watches the girls 
   getting undressed, vowing that he will get even with them for 
   invading his privacy. Rick and Dermott check out the dungeon and when 
   they open the Iron Maiden, Suzy's dead body falls to the ground. We 
   then find out that Edith was once engaged to Travis, who was a 
   muscleman actor in Italian peplum films (talk about art imitating 
   life!), he had a nervous breakdown and disappeared. This is the first 
   time Suzy has seen him in years. Why the hell didn't she tell anyone 
   else when she first saw him??? We then see that model Kinojo (Moa 
   Tahi; <B><A HREF="wild_wild_planet_1965.htm">WILD, WILD PLANET</A></B> 
   - 1966) is caught in a deadly booby trap that looks like a giant 
   spider web. If she, or anyone else, touches the web's ropes, Kinojo 
   will be shot with innumerable arrows. Rick shimmies under the web, 
   playing a game that looks like a spy breaking into a bank vault 
   protected by infrared beams, and saves Kinojo, only to discover that 
   everyone is trapped in the castle. Yes, Travis is quite mad, dressing 
   as the Crimson Executioner and dispatching the cast one-by-one, using 
   the dungeon's torture devices. In his twisted mind, he thinks this is 
   just another acting gig, only he takes his performance too far. Edith 
   calls him an &quot;egoist&quot;, which pushes him over the edge, 
   stepping up his torture and killing of both men and women (he doesn't 
   discriminate). Nancy (Rita Klein) and Annie (Femi Benussi; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#KillerMustKillAgain">THE
    KILLER MUST KILL AGAIN</A></B> - 1973) are tied to a rotating 
   torture device, sharp swords getting closer to slicing-up their 
   bodies on every rotation. Rick is tied to a dead Raoul and placed on 
   a canopy bed, where the top of the canopy, which contains deadly 
   spikes, inches closer to his body. The women are also stretched on 
   the rack and tortured on a curious device that <A HREF="bloody_pit_of_horror_1965_foreign_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/bloody pit of horror italy poster6 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="251" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>drips
    cold water on the victim's exposed back. Will Anyone survive? Will 
   Travis go back to acting in peplum flicks? (He better hurry up 
   because, in 1965, they went out of favor with audiences!). Will the 
   Crimson Executioner ever wear yellow?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Yes, I am having some fun at this film's expense, but that is 
   because I never get tired of watching it. Director Massimo Pupillo 
   (credited as &quot;Max Hunter&quot;; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#TerrorCreatures1965">TERROR
    CREATURES FROM THE GRAVE</A></B> - 1965) and screenwriters

   (Roberto Natale; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WatchMeKill1977">WATCH ME 
   WHEN I KILL</A></B> - 1977) have crafted a very colorful film that 
   makes absolutely no sense. That's its charm, as we never see the 
   Crimson Executioner capture anyone, they are just being tortured 
   while Hargitay laughs like a madman. Why waste time showing how they 
   got there? Hargitay goes off the rails here. He is normally a stiff 
   and wooden actor, but he seems to relish the role of the Crimson 
   Executioner. Some of the deaths are quite explicit for 1965, 
   especially Nancy getting shot with an arrow in her cleavage and Annie 
   getting sliced in both breasts by the rotating device. There is also 
   an unpleasant death in a metal cage that hangs above a raging fire.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Something Weird Video/Image Entertainment released a nice widescreen

   compilation, <A HREF="midnight_movie_madness_50_movie_collection_dvd_compilation.htm">Midnight

   they cram five films on one DVD, the print is in widescreen and looks 
   surprisingly sharp. I don't know how they did it because it looks

   A group of obnoxious teenagers decide to spend a weekend in a 
   long-shut camping site, where 15 years earlier a series of grisly 
   murders took place. The locals attributed the murders to an old 
   Indian shaman, the legend of the forest. Before you can say 
   &quot;How!&quot;, the teenagers are being dispatched in various 
   excessive gory ways. Could it be the Indian shaman doing the dirty 
   deeds or could it be the owner of the campsite (David Hess), his wife 
   (Mimsy Farmer), the town sheriff (Charles Napier) who is having an 
   affair with Farmer, the town doctor (John Steiner), Deputy Sheriff 
   Ted (Ivan Rassimov) or Hess' son (Nicola Farron, who looks like a 
   young Clark Kent) who has just returned from a stint in the Army? 
   It's not hard to figure out who the culprit is, but the gory killings

   celluloid shit. You can make the call. The basic premise is this: A 
   group of really annoying, no-talent teens go on an archeological dig 
   to recover the Bog People (the film's original title), a midieval 
   tribe of Danish Berserkers buried in a swamp. Before you can say 
   &quot;I wonder how many of the teens are going to be killed?&quot;, 
   most of them are dispatched by the reanimated bog-thingies. If you 
   come into this film looking for some bloody killings and plenty of 
   nudity, be forewarned: Despite the film's R-rating, there's very 
   little nudity (fleeting glimpses of nubians' breasts in the first 5 
   minutes of the film) and absolutely no extreme violence at all. This 
   film could have easily been rated PG if the nudity (about 2 seconds 
   worth) was cut out. All the actors are extremely bad, even the only

   bloodshed (really, you never know what direction this film is going 
   to take and the stoner of the group, Marty [Fran Kranz], and his 
   collapsible thermal coffee mug/bong, turns out to be a hero!). Lots 
   of laugh-out-loud humor (the phone call that Bradley Whitford puts on 
   loudspeaker from grizzled old tobacco-spitting gas station owner 
   Mordecai [Tim De Zarn] was one of the funniest things I have ever 
   witnessed; freeze frame the DVD/Blu-Ray when the betting board is on 
   view for some valuable funny info [you'll know the scene when you see 
   it]; the way the Japanese schoolgirls defeat the child ghost is a 
   hoot) and good old-fashioned blood-soaked gore (it flows like a 
   river, although there is plenty of excellent CGI, especially during 
   the finale). The reason for the delay to release this film was 
   because the studio wanted to convert it to 3-D, but level heads 
   prevailed. This originally played theatrically, where it more than 
   recouped its 30 million dollar budget. Don't expect a sequel for this 
   film because it doesn't leave room for one. My highest 
   recommendation. Oh, and one other thing: Beware of the Merman!!! Also

   This low-budget AIDS parable is quite good and packs a powerful 
   punch. An outcast (Gregory Fortescue), who is unjustly accused of 
   killing his parents, is attacked by a bigfoot-like creature who 
   transfers a contagious disease into his body. The poor boy becomes a 
   carrier of this strange disease which is transmitted by his touch. 
   Any object this boy touches means certain death to any person who 
   holds it, as it dissolves flesh and bone. Soon the entire population

   viewing this particular film, subconscience be damned, I'm going to 
   review it! I must admit that I was expecting an excellent Eurocrime 
   film, but I got much, much more. This is actually a look into the 
   Italian prison system, where lawlessness and corruption run rampant 
   and prisoners are used as pieces on a chess board. Whether they win 
   or lose the game depends on the actions of the prisoner, but there 
   are ways to &quot;influence&quot; the prisoner so the game is in 
   their favor.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The pawn in this case is Vanzi (the always-excellent Franco Nero; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#QuietPlaceCountry68">A
    QUIET PLACE IN THE COUNTRY</A></B> - 1968), a well-off architect who 
   is thrown in prison for suspicion of a hit and run with his car and 
   then leaving the scene of an accident (he is innocent). Vanzi, who 
   has never been in prison before (hell, he has never received a 
   traffic ticket), is thrown in a cell with four extremely dangerous 
   prisoners, all of them murderers.&nbsp; They are: Simonetti 
   (Ricciardetto Desimone; Rumor has it that he was a real-life killer, 
   who offered to be this film's prison advisor as long as they gave him 
   a role. Regardless whether this is true or not, he is definitely 
   frightening!), a bald-headed bastard who makes Vanzi write home so 
   his family will send him packages of goodies, explaining to Vanzi 
   that no one in the cell has family to send them anything, but he does 
   (Every sentence that comes out of Simonetti's mouth is an implied 
   threat); Crotta (Corrado Solari; <B><A HREF="action.htm#ExecutionSquad1972">EXECUTION
    SQUAD</A></B> - 1972), a young man of few words, but when he snaps 
   his fingers, Vanzi better have a cigarette for him (and lit, too!); 
   Biro (John Steiner; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#PlotOfFear1976">PLOT OF FEAR</A></B> 
   - 1976), the worst of the lot; he killed a prisoner recently and was 
   sentenced to a second life term; he tells Vanzi that a third life 
   term means nothing to him and he better keep an eye open when he 
   sleeps because he may kill him (&quot;Am I lying or telling the 
   truth? I'll let you make the decision.&quot; says Biro to Vanzi just 
   as he is about to go to sleep). The fourth cellmate is Compolini 
   (Georges Wilson; Lucio Fulci's <B><A HREF="beatrice_cenci_1969.htm">BEATRICE
    CENCI</A></B> - 1969) a sickly prisoner who is slowly dying and 
   schools Vanzi about prison life, but he makes him promise that when 
   he is bedridden and dying, to make sure no one comes to visit him (he 
   believes his crime is too heinous for his family to visit him, which 
   leads to a truly heartbreaking scene in the prison hospital later 
   on). He is the only one in the cell to call him Vanzi; the other 
   three call him &quot;Architect&quot; to remind Vanzi of his weath and 
   status in society. The guards are all scared of Biro because they 
   know he would kill them for no reason (What's three life terms 
   compared to two?), so they cowtow to his every demand, such as when 
   he shouts he wants some wine and one of the guards rushes to get a 
   carafe of wine and delivers it to him! But there's an inmate in the 
   prison who gets more attention. It's Mafia kingpin Salvatore Rosa 
   (Claudio Nicastro; <B><A HREF="action.htm#SilentAction1975">SILENT ACTION</A></B> 
   - 1975), whom everyone listens to because he gets things done and 
   knows everything about everyone's personal lives. The corrupt Warden 
   of the prison (Ferruccio De Ceresa; <B><A HREF="sicilian_checkmate_1972.htm">THE
    SICILIAN CHECKMATE</A></B> - 1972; A perfect companion piece to this 
   film, as it shows how the corrupt Italian judicial system works and 
   we can imagine how Vanzi got himself thrown in prison by watching 
   this film) is on Rosa's payroll and does everything he asks. Rosa 
   lives like a king in prison, as he has his own cappuccino machine, TV 
   and other luxuries of life that prisoners are not supposed to have. 
   Rosa is trying to get the head quard, the Brigadere (Daniele Dublino; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#BlackBellyTarantula">BLACK
    BELLY OF THE TARANTULA</A></B> - 1971), to join his team, but he 
   resists, until Rosa offers his college-educated son, who cannot find 
   employment, a really good job. Vanzi wants nothing to do with Rosa, 
   thinking he will not be in prison that long to need any of his 
   &quot;favors&quot;, but circumstances beyond his control makes sure 
   his stay in prison is longer than it should be. He finds the trio of 
   brutal idiots in his cell devouring all the goodies his wife sent 
   him, but when he discovers that someone pissed on his bed (actually, 
   all three of them did!) and also pissed on his photos of his wife and 
   three children, he has had enough and goes to Rosa for help. Rosa has 
   him put in a cell with two other less-violent inmates: Zagarella 
   (Luigi Zerbinati; Fulci's <B><A HREF="eroticist_1972.htm">THE EROTICIST</A></B> 
   - 1972), an overweight man who likes to make paper dolls, and Pesenti 
   (Riccardo Cucciolla; <B><A HREF="no_the_case_is_happily_resolved_1973.htm">NO,
    THE CASE IS HAPPILY RESOLVED</A></B> - 1973; another great film 
   about the unjust Italian judicial system), who is also in prison on a 
   trumped-up charge. He is about to be a witness in a case involving 
   corruption, where an inadequately-built dam burst open and killed 
   over a thousand people. He is going to testify against the 
   construction company that built the dam and Pesenti is afraid that 
   Vanzi is a spy sent to kill him. After earning Pesenti's respect, 
   they become great friends, but Pesenti doesn't know that Vanzi saw 
   him pass an important note to Ventura (a fantastic Antonio Casale; <B><A HREF="action.htm#ViolentProfession73">THE
    VIOLENT PROFESSIONALS</A></B> - 1973), a prisoner who can get you 
   anything in prison for a price; he is even able to get mail sent out 
   without the prison reading it first. Rosa saw Pesenti handing Ventura 
   the note and had other prisoners almost beat Ventura to death, but 
   Vanzi saw where Ventura threw the note before he was attacked and it 
   is still there.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Rosa knows that Vanzi knows where the note is, but he refuses to 
   tell him, so Rosa makes Vanzi's life very difficult, having the 
   Warden makes sure he is not able to see his wife on visiting day and 
   then having him thrown in solitary confinement for two weeks (After a 
   couple of days in solitary, Vanzi screams out &quot;I am a human 
   being! No man should be treated like this!&quot; and begins crying.). 
   He then has no other choice but to tell Rosa where the note is, which 
   results in Pesenti's death (The Brigadere leaves the door to their 
   cell open, where Biro and a few other inmates enter. Pesenti knows 
   what is about to happen and says, &quot;Please make it painless&quot;,
    as they hold him down on his bed while Biro slices his wrist with a 
   razor blade and he bleeds out and dies. Vanzi is shocked by what he 
   sees, but deep down he knows he is responsible. The corrupt prison 
   doctor (Piero Nuti; <B><A HREF="petomaniac_1983.htm">PETOMANIAC</A></B> 
   - 1983, the Italian fart movie!) classifies Pesenti's death as a 
   suicide and Vanzi remains silent, which results in him getting freed 
   from prison and found not guilty of all the charges brought against 
   him. The film concludes with Vanzi celebrating his victory with a 
   party on his yacht with his &quot;friends&quot; (none of whom<A HREF="case_is_closed_forget_it_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/case is closed forget it german blu-ray front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="251" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>

   Zamengo; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Suspiria1977">SUSPIRIA</A></B> 
   - 1977) appears on the dock and asks Vanzi if her father's death was 
   actually a suicide. Vanzi looks at her and says, &quot;Sorry, I can't 
   help you&quot; and walks away. Prison has certainly changed Vanzi and 
   not for the better.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    gut-wrenching and incisive film, shot as <B><A HREF="case_is_closed_forget_it_1971.htm#Italy Title">L'ISTRUTTORIA
    E' CHIUSA DIMENTICHI</A></B> (a literal translation of the review 
   title) is a powerful indictment of the Italian prison system, where 
   the inmates run the asylum and it's a place where a good man can lose 
   his conscience for reasons beyond his control. As we see in this 
   film, you can only push a man so far before he breaks, as he watches 
   helplessly as the people who helped him are ruthlessly pummeled by 
   other prisoners on the orders of Rosa and the unscrupulous guards, 
   who are more worried about their lives then they are their jobs (and 
   some would say rightfully so, but it's not that easy because they 
   were hired to do a job and then became corrupt). Director Damiano 
   Damiani, who co-wrote the screenplay with Massimo DeRita (<B><A HREF="big_racket_1976.htm">THE
    BIG RACKET</A></B> - 1976) and Arduino Maiuri (<B><A HREF="street_law_1974.htm">STREET
    LAW</A></B> - 1974), does a wonderful job exposing the inadequecies 
   and horrendous treatment of early-'70s Italy prison life, where the 
   rich are treated better than the poor, as long as they go along with 
   the status quo. If they don't, as Vanzi learns, it will be a 
   life-changing experience and one that he will never forget until the 
   day he dies (Full disclosure here: I once spent a weekend in prison 
   for something I didn't do [it's a long story about alimony payments, 
   ones that I payed, but since I was arrested on a Friday night, I 
   couldn't see a judge until Monday morning] and it was an experience I 
   will take with me to my grave. Nothing sexual happened, but I was 
   treated rather brutally, so this film definitely hit me hard and 
   brought back some painful memories). Ennio Morricone's <A HREF="case_is_closed_forget_it_1971.htm#OST">sparse
    music score</A> also adds greatly to the film's tone of helplessness 
   and human indignity, making this film a must for fans of the 
   unexpected. My favorite prison film was always <B><A HREF="brubaker_1980.htm">BRUBAKER</A></B> 
   (1980), but this film is now my new personal choice. It never

   theatrically or on home video in any format, but you can see it 
   streaming on YouTube from user &quot;Eurocrime Realm&quot; in a 
   fairly nice anamorphic widescreen print in Italian with English 
   subtitles. I promise to review more of Damiani's films in the near 
   future, but take my word for it, they are all essential films for the 
   Italian genre film buff in you. Also featuring Patrizia Adiutori (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Torso1973">TORSO</A></B>

   more serious problem: They are not alone. There are winged creatures 
   who are equally at home in the water or on dry land and they have a 
   hunger for their new visitors' flesh. When Jack is bitten by this new 
   species of creature, he slowly begins to change and has some type of

    as it is an affectionate (albeit gory) tribute to the old EC Comics 
   of yore (Although some real-life &quot;graphic novelists&quot; have 
   problems with this film. Let them make their own goddamn film!). 
   Thirty years earlier an artist by the name of Colin Childress 
   (Jeffrey Combs in what amounts to a cameo) is writer and illustrator 
   of a horror comic called Cellar Dweller. He uses an old magic book 
   for inspiration and one day the drawing of his monster comes to life 
   and kills a woman he has drawn. He kills the monster by setting his 
   fresh drawing on fire, killing himself in the process. The police 
   investigation portrays Colin as a murderer and the case is closed. 
   Thirty years later, a comics artist named Whitney (Deborah Mullowney, 
   a.k.a. Deborah Farentino) goes to Colin's old house, which is now an 
   artists' retreat run by Mrs. Briggs (Yvonne De Carlo). Whitney begins 
   drawing Colin's comic Cellar Dweller (using the magic book for ideas) 
   and the monster begins to go on a killing spree again. Former cop 
   turned novelist (Vince Edwards) is gorily decapitated (a good 
   effect). Lisa (Cheryl Ann Wilson, a.k.a. Miranda Wilson) is eaten by 
   the creature after taking a shower (nudity alert!). Whitney's old 
   arch nemesis Amanda (Pamela Bellwood) is also dispatched by the 
   monster. Whitney, with the help of fellow artist Phillip (Brian 
   Robbins), try to kill the monster, but the monster kills Phillip 
   instead. Whitney finds a way to kill the creature (she throws 
   White-Out on the drawings!) and draws all the dead people and brings 
   them back to life. But Whitney soon finds out that the comics 
   business can be a killer. Filmed on a shoestring budget in Italy for 
   Executive Producer Charles Band's Empire Pictures (which would 
   transform into Full Moon Pictures a few years later), <B><A HREF="cellar_dweller_1987b.htm">CELLAR

    way]) and many others are like this film, where clowns can be 
   substituted for any non-greasepainted psychos. The film opens with a 
   baby sitter (Kaitlyn Sapp, who shows us her breasts within the first 
   5 minutes of the film), putting her two charges to bed and then 
   hearing on the TV news that there has been a bad train accident, the 
   worst in the State's (filmed in Ohio) history. She then sees one of 
   the children, Ricky (Nathan D. Goins) dressed in a clown outfit 
   running upstairs. She also goes upstairs to see why he is dressed 
   like that, only to be stabbed and meat-cleavered in her stomach. 15 
   years later, Brad (Brian Nagel) is about to ask his girlfriend Sarah 
   (Lauren Elise) to marry him after they go to a Country Music concert 
   in Columbus and he shows the ring to his best friend Mike (Andrew 
   Staton, also Stunt Coordinator). The foursome, including Mike's 
   girlfriend Jill (Katie Keene) take instructions from the locals in a 
   diner, including the Sheriff<A HREF="clowntown_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/clowntown 2015 dvd front8a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="162" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   (Christopher Lawrence Chapman, also an Executive Producer) on how to 
   take a shortcut to Columbus, but he also warns them not to stop in 
   any strange little towns and you just know they are heading into 
   trouble. Brad takes the Sheriff's directions, while one of the locals 
   in a diner is killed by someone with a crowbar, who shoves it in his 
   throat. Jill discovers she has lost her phone (she freaks out because 
   her credit card information is on it; stupid girl), so Sarah tells 
   her to use her cell phone to call the diner to see if her phone is 
   there. Jill calls the diner and a man answers and says he has her 
   phone. He wants to know where they are, so she gives him their 
   location. The voice on the other end of the phone tells them where to 
   meet him and he will return the phone. They end up in a small, 
   seemingly deserted town, that is not as deserted as the foursome 
   thinks. It is occupied by a group of psycho clowns, one holding a 
   baseball bat (David Greathouse; the most disturbing of the lot), who 
   likes to play with fire, one holding a machete (Chris Hahn). one 
   holding a crowbar (Ryan Pilz, also the Production Designer), one 
   wielding an axe (Alan Tuskes) and even a psychotic girl clown (Beki 
   Ingram). As you can probably already guess, this small town has no 
   cell phone service and their car won't start. While walking down the 
   street, Jill sees the machete clown and is almost hit by a pickup 
   truck driven by co-workers Billy (Director/editor Tom Nagel) &amp; 
   Dylan (Jeff Denton) who were both at the diner the same time when the 
   foursome was. The crowbar clown kills Billy and the baseball clown 
   sets him on fire, while everyone else runs and hides in an empty 
   Recreational Vehicle. An old crazy man named Frank (Greg Violand) 
   saves their hides and takes them to his hideout.. Jill is captured by 
   the clowns and tied -up, where the famale clown says &quot;I am going 
   to make you so pretty!&quot; Frank tells them that ever since the 
   terrible train wreck 15 years earlier, this town has never been the 
   same. People ended up missing and the clowns suddenly appeared 
   (flashbacks show us the clowns killing people , including a girl 
   sunbathing in her bikini). Nearly everyone forgot the town existed 
   (which I find highly unlikely for reasons apparent to everyone). I 
   don't think I have to tell you the way the film progresses, as the 
   clowns begin to pick off the group one by one. First Dylan has his 
   jaw torn in half by the crowbar clown and then has the crowbar jammed 
   into his stomach. Jill is grabbed by the crowbar clown, but Brad 
   saves her and kills the clown with his own crowbar by bashing his 
   head in. Brad recognizes the clown as the busboy in the diner by the 
   tattoo on his arm, so all the other clowns must be members of the 
   diner. The girl clown covers Sarah's face with greasepaint and she 
   screams like she is having her arm cut off! Brad, Mike and Jill 
   &quot;borrow&quot; Billy &amp; Dylan's truck and discover Frank 
   stumbling down the street with an object impaled in his stomach. They 
   are all attacked by the clowns and they all run in different 
   directions. Brad finds a house occupied by an old lady named Myrtle 
   (Maryanne Nagel; and yes, there is a lot of nepotism in this film), 
   who was the mother of young boy Ricky in the beginning of the film. 
   Flashbacks show us Myrtle killed the babysitter. Ricky is the 
   baseball bat clown with a fixation for fire. For some reasons left 
   unclear, the Sheriff from the diner is behind this all. Will Brad 
   propose to Sarah? Will Mike and Jill survive? Will the clowns join a 
   psycho circus? (Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey went out of 
   business in 2017, which wouldn't surprise me if their clowns went 
   bonkers.) I'm afraid you'll have to watch this for yourself to get 
   those answers. Director/Editor Tom Nagel is better known as an actor, 
   appearing in such films as The Asylum's <B><A HREF="beast_of_bray_road_2005.htm">THE

   Asylum film and quite graphic (Effects done by Robert Kurtzman's 
   Creature Corps (He is also a Co-Producer), there is nothing here that 
   you haven't seen a dozen times before. While the beginning of the 
   film makes us believe we are going to see more female nudity, it is 
   the only scene of it in the entire film. but this is a good little

   their bodies for sex. Hart enters the church where the current crop 
   of kidnapped women are being held, telling them that he will lead 
   them to safety, but first he sneaks into the auction house and kills 
   a couple of buyers with his shotgun. He then hold Pike at bay with 
   his shotgun, telling him that if he wants to see Polk alive, he will 
   do what he says. He holds Pike hostage, giving Abilene and the other 
   kidnapped women enough time to escape, but someone with a bullwhip 
   disarms Hart, Pike demanding to know where his brother is. When Hart 
   refuses to tell him, he burns Hart's hand with a red hot poker, Hart

    1985), working with a script written by Gene Quintano, Wolfe 
   Lowenthal and Lloyd Battista (the last two also responsible for the 
   screenplay of <B>MEAN</B>), still manages to milk the many 3-D 
   effects for all they are worth. The opening credits are in 3-D, 
   written in unusual places, such as a snake wrapped around a wine 
   bottle (and the wine bottle's label), the bottom of a horse's hoof, a 
   bag of coffee beans, and a gun barrel, just to name a few. It should 
   also be noted that the opening 15 minutes are dialogue-free, just 
   Carlo Savina's excellent music score and various sound effects, yet 
   it still manages to tell the story about what happened to Hart and 
   his bride. There are also 3-D effects that you will not see in any 
   other film, including the baby girl's nudity, which makes this film 
   stand out from the pack. Even though I watched this film in 2-D, the 
   3-D effects still manage to pack a punch. Sure, there are a lot of 
   gun barrels thrust into the camera and plenty of slow-motion deaths 
   (with bloody bullet sqibs exploding in your face), but it's the 
   little things used for 3-D that makes this film so enjoyable. I 
   should footnote this review by explaining that I never saw a 3-D 
   movie. Hell, I can't even see in 3-D, since I was born with only one 
   working eye (no cyclops jokes, please, I still have two eyes, it's 
   just that one doesn't work). Whenever I wanted to see a 3-D movie, I 
   had to find a theater playing it in 2-D (otherwise it would just be a 
   blur to me), making it tough, especially in the elongated 3-D craze 
   that hit us in the New Millennium (the longest in 3-D history). Since 
   this is an R-Rated 3-D film, even the plentiful female nudity is in 
   your face, as are the bloody deaths. Even Pike's explosive death 
   registers in 2-D, proving to me that you don't need two good eyes to 
   enjoy a 3-D film. Baldi directed a 3-D companion film, the <B><A HREF="raiders_of_the_lost_ark_1981.htm">RAIDERS</A></B>

   beings as he can with him. Too bad that freshman director/producer 
   Peter Hurd (His only film when this review was written) pared Logan 
   Goin's screenplay down to the bare bones. Too many things happen with 
   no explanation. First, Grant steals some top secret files called 
   &quot;Blank Slate&quot; and they contain the combination to a vault 
   which houses &quot;The Machine&quot;, a chair that enables people who 
   sit in it to wipe their brain clean and transfer another person's 
   memory into it. By the time the it is over, your head will be 
   spinning from all the new layers that keep on getting added to the 
   film with no backstory. The film actually centers on college student 
   Jack (Ross Destiche), who was a loner and just lost his sister in a 
   preventable car accident. He blows the whole experiment wide open 
   when he discovers one of the &quot;crow people&quot; (The Agency 
   keeps watch on the group while wearing crow masks and hooded black 
   robes) is actually electronic surveillance. While the film is 
   interesting (Except for actress Emily Soto, who plays ghost girl 
   Anne. Her voice is so grating you'll want to whip out a wheel of 
   cheese.), it travels all over the map, making it difficult to keep up 
   with the story. I am sure director Hurd wanted to make a completely 
   understandable film, but it is obvious he didn't have the budget. 
   Hurd does throw in some nifty practical effects (The optical effects 
   are sub-par) such as Grant killing Agent Torrez (Taso N. Stavrakis; 
   who also played &quot;Torrez&quot; in the late George A. Romero's <B><A HREF="day_of_the_dead.htm">DAY
    OF THE DEAD</A></B> - 1985) by breaking his back until his feet 
   touch the back of his head. He comes back to life and spider walks, 
   much in the same way Linda Blair did in the cut scene from <B><A HREF="exorcist.htm">THE
    EXORCIST</A></B> (1973). Angent Torrez eventually gets his fingers 
   cut off and his head separated from his body with a hacksaw. There is 
   also death by electrical straight saw; stepping on a metal spike; 
   Grant originally dies by walking into a room filled with barb wire; a 
   better than average scene where Grant kills two Agents approaching 
   him in different directions by killing them with a shotgun (he 
   non-chalantly kills one coming at him in the front and lays the 
   shotgun on his shoulder and kills one approaching him from the 
   rear.); and other bits of gory violence. But you'll spend more time 
   trying to figure out the story, which is all helter skelter. A nice 
   try, but not a success. For once in films like this, Brad Dourif 
   doesn't put in a five minute cameo. His role in the film is important 
   in some way (If I only could figure it out!). In an easter egg, the 
   DVD cover shows ghost girl Anne holding a Chucky Doll, a tribute to 
   Dourif for appearing in this. To show you how inaccessible this film 
   is, it was made in 2014 but not released on disc until 2017. The 
   acting ranges from professional (Dourif) to amateurish (Soto). Filmed 
   in Fergus Falls, Minnesota. Also starring Monique Candelaria (<B><A HREF="condemned_2_2015.htm">THE

    OR DIE</A><A NAME="CrawlOrDie2014"></A> (2014) -</B> One of the 
   perks of being an Amazon Prime member is that I have been able to 
   watch an awful lot of DTV films released by Uncork'd Entertainment on 
   DVD for free. Surprisingly, a lot of them have been good to 
   excellent, but this film, originally titled <B><A HREF="crawl_bitch_crawl_2014.htm">CRAWL
    BITCH CRAWL</A></B> and made for less than $7,000, is not one of 
   them. It's supposed to fill us with the dread of claustrophobia, but 
   all it really does is make us look at the clock and wait for it to 
   end. The opening looks like some found footage film, as the cameras 
   shake and shimmy while we watch a band of Special Forces soldiers 
   shooting at something that doesn't look human (it's really hard to 
   make out, even when you freeze frame), while they are lowering a 
   civilian woman down the opening of an underground tunnel and then 
   joining her. They keep very quiet while one of the Special Forces 
   soldiers turns the wheel to lock the surface door, while another 
   tries to booby-trap the door, but he drops the triggering mechanism 
   down to the ground. Instead of throwing the trigger back up to him, 
   the alien breaks in and the soldier blows himself up, but it has no 
   effect on the alien (Not 5 minutes into this film and I know this 
   squad of Special Forces soldiers are nothing but a bunch of 
   screw-ups). We are then transported seven months in the past at a 
   mission briefing of the same Special Forces team. It seems we are in 
   the future where a virus had made nearly all the women infertile. 
   General Z (David Zeliff) informs the squad he has received a 
   &quot;Code 455&quot;, which means they have located two women that 
   are fertile (a statistic so improbable to calculate, it would make 
   any scientist roll his/her eyes in disbelief and the plot reminded me 
   of both the <A HREF="crawl_or_die_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/crawl or die poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="322" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Jean-Claude

   CYBORG: STEEL WARRIOR</A></B> [1993], one of Cannon Films last 
   productions), but one of the women has passed away from the virus. 
   Their job is to escort &quot;The Package&quot; (Torey Byrne) as she 
   is flown off the planet in the spaceship Oklahoma (an in-joke; but 
   this film is so cheap that no spaceship is ever shown) and all will 
   be put in cryosleep for seven months, where they will land on 
   &quot;Earth 2&quot;. The General says that all the rumors they heard 
   are true; they are preparing a disease-free planet for habitation by 
   non-diseased people, but it will still take four more years to 
   finish. Since this unit has never lost a single package (hard to 
   believe after what we witnessed in the beginning of the film), the 
   General makes it clear that no matter how much the Package cries or 
   complains, she must be delivered (to whom we are never told). She is 
   to be treated like an actual package than a human being (if this is 
   our future, stop the car, I want to get out). We are then back in the 
   tunnels seven months later, as Special Forces leader Tank (Nicole 
   Alonzo; one of the film's Producers and wannabe singer; she has a 
   haircut that would never be approved by the Special Forces) leads the 
   troops and the Package through the tunnels, which gets smaller and 
   smaller, until the men in the squad, including Snoop (Wil Crown), Doc 
   (Tommy Ball), Mic (Tom Chamberlain), Thumper (Larry Huitt) and over a 
   half-dozen &quot;red shirts&quot; (A term taken from the original <B><A HREF="star_trek_1966.htm">STAR
    TREK</A></B> (1966 - 1969), where, if an unknown crew member was 
   beamed down to a planet wearing a red shirt, you knew he was going to 
   die) cannot crawl or squeeze through the opening, and try to find an 
   alternate means to their destination (which we still don't know), 
   while Tank strips down to her underwear and has the Package crawl in 
   front of her. I know we are supposed to get a severe case of 
   claustrophobia, but all we really get is a case of severe case of 
   boredom and hope that the camera gives us another crotch shot of 
   Tank. The alien (played by Matthew Crabtree, who also designed the 
   creature suit and plays one of the red shirt Special Forces members) 
   grabs the Package and takes off down the tiny tunnels, with Tank 
   trying to follow them. When she finally gets to a chamber, we don't 
   see the Package (the alien probably ate her, but that is just 
   speculation on my part), so her team finds a way to pull her up from 
   the chamber and Tank sets the alien on fire (the film is so cheap, we 
   don't even see the creature suit on fire). So much for their unit 
   never losing a package and they have probably killed all mankind. 
   While the alien is following the two and then grabs the Package, all 
   we get is nothing but a short view of it during the finale, where it 
   looks like a cross between <B><A HREF="alien_1979c.htm">ALIEN</A></B> 
   (1979) and <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#ForbiddenWorld1982">FORBIDDEN
    WORLD</A></B> (1982). This entire film, 
   directed/co-produced/screenwritten/set designed (I bet that cost him 
   $50)/co-photographed by Oklahoma Ward, picked a pretty poor film to 
   make as his feature film debut (all he did was short films before 
   this). The closest I can come to describe it is one of those cheap 
   80's &amp; 90's Roger Corman productions (like <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#TerrorWithin">THE
    TERROR WITHIN</A></B> - 1988), but at least Corman's films gave us 
   blood, gore and creatures we can actually see and not the 
   quick-cutting one second shots of blood, gore, the creature and 
   always shaking camera that Ward offers us here. There are lengthy 
   periods of no dialogue, just a droning background noise that induces 
   headaches (I swear my 5.1 Dolby Stereo System was crying!) and a 
   whole lot of unanswered questions (How did a huge alien drag the 
   Package through such tight areas? What is Earth 2 doing with an 
   underground tunnel system and what purpose does it serve? Is the 
   alien a resident of Earth 2 or did it follow them to stop Earth 
   people from continuing to exist? How did the virus start? Was it man 
   made, alien made or a natural occurrence?). There are so many 
   unanswered questions in this film that a book can be written about 
   them and don't go looking for answers (not even what happened to the 
   Package), because you will get none. I am always willing to give 
   directors a second chance, but the next film Oklahoma Ward directs 
   better be something spectacular. Even though it cost under $7,000 to 
   make, that is no excuse. <B><A HREF="films_on_the_fringe.htm#Skinless2013">SKINLESS</A></B> 
   (2013) was made for less than $2,000 and held me spellbound. This 
   film just held me prisoner and all of Tank's scenes are filmed with a 
   sickly blue filter for no other reason than his digital camera 
   allowed it. If you like your action in one second edits, gore in even 
   less time and never a really good look at the alien, you may like 
   this film (you poor bastard). I actually had a better time brushing 
   my cats than watching this cheap excuse as an 80's throwback film. No 
   nudity, no really discernible blood or gore (thanks to the quick 
   editing) and no answered questions. After the end credits it says 
   &quot;Tank will return soon.&quot; Let's hope not. God, let's hope 
   not. Also starring David Paul Baker, Clayton Burgess, Troy Bailey, 
   Jonathan Dixon, Robbie Huitt, Jeremy Sellers, John Stirling, Austin 
   Wood and J. Luke Lanson as the interchangeable Special Forces team.

   to death in the 80's, with films like <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Last Shark">THE
    LAST SHARK</A></B> (1981, footage from it is also in this film) and <B><A HREF="deep_blood_1989.htm">DEEP
    BLOOD</A></B> (1989, still more cribbed footage). Anyway, if you 
   must know the story, here it is: A shark is terrorizing the coastal 
   Florida community of Hampton Bay, killing swimmers and scuba divers, 
   leaving their half-eaten carcasses on the beach. A real estate 
   magnate, who is trying to buy out the local aquarium (whose owner 
   looks like a skinny Hulk Hogan), tries to cover-up the attacks until 
   after his deal and the annual regatta are both completed. Billy 
   (Gregg Hood), a visiting oceanographer, tries to help the concerned 
   sheriff, Francis (David Luther), rid the town of the shark before 
   more people are killed. Billy and the sheriff face off against the 
   shark in separate battles and only one of them will come out alive. 
   Much stupidity follows and did I actually hear somebody say, &quot;We 
   need a bigger helicopter?&quot;! For an Italian horror film, I must 
   say that I was bitterly disappointed with this one. We never watch 
   these kind of films for the storyline, but rather for the blood and 
   nudity. Sadly, <B><A HREF="cruel_jaws_1995b.htm">CRUEL JAWS</A></B> 
   is severely lacking in both departments, probably because it was made 
   for European TV. While there are plenty of good-looking women in 
   teenie bikinis, they never take them off and the gore is basically 
   just shots of body parts lying on the beach and a couple of views of 
   the shark munching on humans (it's bloodless). The shark attack 
   scenes are laughable as most of them are stolen from other films. The 
   scene where the shark attacks the regatta and a little girl in a 
   wheelchair who rolls into the waiting jaws of the shark, only to be 
   saved by Billy's girlfriend (who becomes chum), is awkward and 
   clumsily filmed. All the little girl says after the attack is,

    bring it back to life. The first 30 minutes, though, is hastily-shot 
   footage filmed in the mid-70's about a teacher giving a class on the 
   history of Bigfoot (which cuts to way too much nature footage, a <B><A HREF="jaws_1975.htm">JAWS</A></B> 
   (1975) reference, and even more stock footage), which the leads to a 
   short story about two men in a truck who meet a bigfoot in the woods 
   (it just seems long because of the endless padding of the two men 
   walking in the forest), which then leads to a visiting professor 
   (Dennis Kottmeier, returning from the original film) telling the same 
   class a story about his run-in with a bigfoot 15 years earlier (cue 
   the 1958 footage), where three of his seven students he brought with 
   him on that fateful field trip would end up in a mental institution. 
   I think they ended up there because they needed drugs to keep them 
   from slashing their wrists from the sheer boredom.&nbsp; While this 
   could have been an interesting time capsule, the fact that nothing 
   much happens throughout the entire running time pretty much sinks any 
   novelty value this film has for those seeking something different. 
   Since it takes over 30 minutes to get past the new footage (and 
   believe me when I say that watching grass grow is more interesting), 
   most viewers would have turned it off long before getting to the old 
   stuff. Not that the old stuff is any better as it's just as inane as 
   the new stuff and the film stock of the old footage has an overly red 
   tint to it and is much blurrier than the new footage. The only fun 
   spot is when one of the 50's kids says, &quot;Boy, I could go for a 
   bottle of pop.&quot; The other kid asks for a dime plus three cents 
   for the deposit! The creature from the 50's footage isn't really a 
   bigfoot. As I have said before, it is actually an ancient Indian 
   mummy (and ridiculous in it's paper-macheness). First (and only time) 
   director Don Fields changed it to a bigfoot probably to appease the 
   audience's 70's fascination with the subject. I remember watching 
   this on TV in the late 70's and being bored to tears. My opinion 
   still hasn't changed. Some things should not be resurrected just 
   because it's old and unseen. Sometimes things should just stayed 
   buried. Starring Bob Clymire, Jan Swihart, Bill Simonsen, and Ruth

    We are first aboard the Moby Dick, a glass-bottom boat piloted by 
   Andres (Andr&eacute;s Garc&iacute;a; <B><A HREF="tintorera_1977.htm">TINTORERA</A></B> 
   - 1977), who tells a group of tourists that he is taking them to a 
   small island with a lighthouse where they will see beautiful, 
   colorful fish through the glass on the bottom of his boat. This group 
   of tourists couldn't be more white bread, including a priest (Arthur 
   Kennedy; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#CaveOfSharks1978">CAVE OF THE SHARKS</A></B> 
   - 1978) who believes more in God than his fellow man; a ditsy rich 
   woman named Shiela (Carroll Baker; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BabaYaga1973">BABA
    YAGA</A></B> - 1973), who dotes on her little dog Christmas (named 
   that because, &quot;She was born the same time as Jesus, midnight on 
   Christmas Eve.&quot;); Monica (Olga Karlatos; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Zombie">ZOMBIE</A></B> 
   - 1979), who is six months pregnant with her third child; a couple of 
   over-inquisitive (i.e. &quot;loveable&quot;) kids; a mean, 
   bald-headed burly guy; a married couple; and your regular assortment 
   of future victims that I like to call &quot;red shirts&quot;. The 
   Weather Service warns the island that a massive cyclone is quickly 
   approaching the island and the surrounding area, but Andres and his 
   crew are unaware of it. Even if they were, there's nowhere to go, as 
   the cyclone is so huge, it threatens to destroy the island and 
   everything in its vicinity.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Meanwhile, a passenger plane piloted by Hugo Stiglitz (<B><A HREF="survive_1976.htm">SURVIVE!</A></B> 
   - 1976, another film based on a true-life incident involving 
   cannibalism, directed by the father of this film's director!) is 
   flying overhead, as flight attendant Linda (Stefania D'Amario; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SisterOfUrsula1978">THE
    SISTER OF URSULA</A></B> - 1978) is serving all the passengers 
   coffee (including all the children!). One child passenger named 
   Tiersa (Edith Gonz&aacute;lez; <B><A HREF="alucarda_1975.htm">ALUCARDA</A></B> 
   - 1975) asks Linda if there are a lot of sharks in the water below 
   and Linda replies, &quot;Don't worry Tiersa, they don't know how to 
   fly.&quot; (What The Fuck??? I mean, I know what the film is trying 
   to do here, letting us know that there are man-eating sharks in the 
   water, but why does she give such a brain-melting answer like that?). 
   Also on the plane are two young boys traveling alone (and enjoying 
   their coffee!); a young man named Thomas (The director's son, Rene 
   Cardona III, using the pseudonym &quot;Al Coster&quot;; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CemeteryOfTerror">CEMETERY
    OF TERROR</A></B> - 1984), who wants to be an oceanographer, even 
   though his friend reminds him he doesn't know how to swim (!); and 
   Mr. Taylor (Lionel Stander; <B><A HREF="squeeze_1978.htm">THE SQUEEZE</A></B> 
   - 1978), the owner of a lobster company that is important to the 
   economy of this small Caribbean island. Taylor's workers on this 
   island want to form a union, so he has come here to talk them out of 
   it, telling another passenger, Dr. Pitorro (Mario Almada; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Blood Screams">BLOOD
    SCREAMS</A></B> - 1987), that he does more than his share for the 
   local workers, such as loans for their housing and boats at low 
   interest rates, schools for their kids and a good price for the 
   lobsters they bring him. A union will cost him a lot of money he 
   doesn't want to spend (Yeah, he's an angel!). The rest of the 
   passangers are as cliched and cardboard cut-outs as the tourists on 
   the Moby Dick. The plane flies directly into the cyclone, as Hugo 
   announces over the intercom that the airport is closed due to the bad 
   weather and they will be unable to land there. Mr. Taylor tells Linda 
   that he wants to talk to the pilot, as he paid for this entire flight 
   so he could land at the airport to take care of some very important 
   business. Linda tells him no, he must remain buckled in his seat 
   until the pilot says it is safe to remove their seatbelts.&nbsp; 
   Unfortunately, that will never happen.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The crew and tourists aboard the Moby Dick are also in the middle of 
   the cyclone, trying to make it to the island, which is being belted 
   by high winds and torrential rain, knocking out electricity, 
   telephones and other means of communication over the entire islamd. 
   The Moby Dick loses its engine, radio and all other instruments in 
   the high waves and drifts aimlessly out to sea. The plane loses one 
   of its engines due to the high winds and&nbsp; severe turbulence, 
   forcing Hugo to radio-in a mayday (there is no answer since the 
   cyclone has destroyed the control tower on the island), as he tries 
   to fly the plane on one engine. Hugo isn't successful, as the plane 
   crashes into the sea and the surviving passengers (including the ones 
   that I mentioned) try to exit the plane before it fills up with water 
   and sinks to the ocean floor.&nbsp; Soon, the survivors of the plane 
   crash meet the survivors on board the Moby Dick, the over-crowded 
   boat (with a solid canopy) being their only means of surviving the 
   dangers the ocean holds, but if they aren't rescued soon, they will 
   either die of thirst or starvation, which ever comes first. They have 
   to ration the water, but when Sheila asks for a ration for her dog 
   Christmas (&quot;She's a passenger just like the rest of us!&quot;), 
   the people on the boat object, especially chief instigator Mr. 
   Taylor, who thinks he is in charge. One of the passengers has a 
   fishing pole and is able to catch some fish, which everyone eats raw, 
   but when he loses the fishing pole when he hooks a shark, everyone 
   wonders how they will survive without any food. When one of the 
   passengers seens Sheila giving her dog a sip of water (She purchased 
   another passenger's share by giving him a thousand dollars!), he 
   throws Christmas overboard, but another passenger jumps in the water 
   and saves the little dog, only to slit its throat and serve it as a 
   meal to the passengers! (The entire time we see the passengers eating 
   Christmas raw, we hear Sheila crying her eyes out!). Once they finish 
   eating the little dog, the question becomes: What else can they eat 
   to survive? A rainstorm solves their water problem and a couple of 
   seriously injured passengers on the boat have either passed away or 
   will soon, so the survivors decide rather than throwing the bodies 
   overboard, Andres will slice into them at their most meaty area, 
   lying the strips of human flesh on top of the canopy, where the 
   sweltering sun will dry them out and they will all have something to 
   eat. (I hear it tastes like chicken). That is everyone, except the 
   priest, who warns everyone that they are breaking God's law, until 
   one passenger quotes from the Bible the &quot;Flesh of my flesh&quot; 
   verse (Isn't it funny how the Bible is full of verses that say the 
   opposite of another verse? Which one do you believe? If you are 
   smart, none of them.). Will Monica lose her baby? Will the people on 
   the boat quit pissing and moaning at each other? What happens to the 
   survivors when one of them accidently breaks the glass bottom of the 
   Moby Dick and it sinks, causing a shark feeding frenzy? Will they be 
   saved and open up a &quot;Long Pig&quot; restaurant? If you want to 
   know the answers to those questions, I'm afraid you'll have to suffer 
   and watch the film. I did!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    That's basically all there is to this overlong film, directed by

   (1975) tossed in to spice things up, this meandering and rather 
   boring film must have looked delicious on paper, but as a film, it's 
   rather a bland dish. The acting also leaves a bad taste, especially 
   by the usually dependable Carroll Baker and Arthur Kennedy. Baker is 
   more concerned for her dog Christmas than she is about any of the 
   passengers. She won't even let her dog eat a piece of raw fish, 
   telling Andres that it will upset her little stomach! Kennedy looks 
   bored beyond tears and doesn't even try to act. His line reading are 
   like they are written on cue cards and he is seing them for the first 
   time (attested by the fact that he didn't hang around to dub his own 
   voice). Everyone else, especially the people who dubbed this 
   Mexico/Spain/Italy co-production, speak their lines in an annoying, 
   emotionless monotone, lulling viewers quickly to sleep. I've seen 
   nearly all the films directed by Rene Cardona Jr. and I would rank 
   this one at the very bottom of his food chain. It's uninvolving, 
   moves at a very slow pace (Making a snail look like an Indy 500 race 
   car) and is just plain unappetizing. Even the music score, by the 
   usually dependable Riz Ortolani (billed here as &quot;Ritz Ortolani&quot;;<B> <A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#CastleOfBlood1964">CASTLE
    OF BLOOD</A></B> - 1964), is bland and unappealing, like eating 
   crackers and drinking water. Okay, enough with the food metaphors. 
   There is about 20 minutes of plot in this 119-minute film, so if you 
   want to be bored for two hours, or if you are looking for a cure to 
   your insomnia, by all means watch this film. All others are warned to 
   stay away. This film's idea of &quot;entertainment&quot; is to show a 
   passenger slitting the poor dog's throat, collecting its blood in a 
   bucket and giving it to a gravely hurt passenger as a substitute for 
   water! If this is your idea of &quot;entertainment&quot;, then you'll 
   probably like this film. I didn't.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    COAST</A></B> - 1987), but this film is one hot mess. This was 
   originally a zombie film directed by Tobe Hooper, but when Producer 
   Edward L. Montoro saw the dailies, he fired Hooper, hired Cardos and 
   decided to change it from a zombie film to a film about an alien 
   serial killer by adding a ridiculous on-screen scrawl in the 
   beginning (read by a narrator just in case you couldn't read) about 
   life on other planets not being that friendly, freeze-frame the 
   zombie footage and add bad optical effects where the now-alien has 
   glowing eyes that shoot laser beams, put gibberish alien language on 
   the soundtrack every time there is a murder and forgot to change 
   other plot points to disguise the fact that it was actually a zombie 
   film (such as a newspaper headline declaring a &quot;Mangler 
   Zombie&quot; is on the loose). The film begins with a young girl 
   being beheaded by some unknown killer (the &quot;alien's&quot; modus 
   operendi, which is never clearly shown in any of the killings) and 
   then mangling her face. She was the daughter of ex-con turned 
   successful horror author Roy Warner (William Devane; who first acts 
   like he has a bad case of tuberculosis and then miraculously stops his<A HREF="dark_1979.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/dark 1979 ad mat8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="255" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   coughing fits about 15 minutes into the film!), who harasses police 
   detective Dave Mooney (Richard Jaeckel) to keep him updated on his 
   progress, something that pisses off Dave since he put Roy in the 
   slammer three years earlier on a manslaughter charge! Dave and his 
   partner Detective Jack Bresler (Biff Elliot; who always has a piece 
   of food in his mouth or hands in every scene he is in) are always in 
   hot water because the killer keeps on beheading and mangling a new 
   victim every night and their Captain (Warren Kemmerling) is chewing 
   them out because there is a leak in the department and the newspapers 
   are calling the killer &quot;The Mangler&quot;. An entertainment TV 
   reporter named Zoe Owens (Cathy Lee Crosby) talks her boss Sherm 
   (Keenan Wynn) into letting her become a serious reporter and start 
   covering The Mangler case. She says something unflattering about Roy 
   (who uses the name &quot;Steve Dupree&quot; when he writes his books) 
   on TV and when they meet in a bar, Roy says to her: &quot;If we were 
   both liberated, I would knock you on your ass!&quot;. While Roy 
   travels the streets in his silver Corvette listening to his police 
   radio for clues, Dave and Jack get a visit from a psychic named De 
   Renzy (Jacquelyn Hyde), who tells them they should be following a 
   young wannabe actor, who she says will soon be a victim of The 
   Mangler. The detectives write her off as some kook, but she does have 
   some psychic connection to the killer (which is never explained). 
   Eventually, Roy and Zoe team-up and believe what De Renzy has to say 
   (De Renzy is psychically attacked in her house in one of the film's 
   many head-scratching scenes, which also includes a pointless scene of 
   Sherm in an underground garage) and try to find out the identity of 
   the wannabe actor. When they do, they follow him and then the alien 
   starts going after them, which brings out Dave, Roy and the entire 
   police force out in force to battle the alien, who shoots death rays 
   from his eyes (killing some police in a puff of smoke and setting 
   others on fire) while the police riddle it with bullets and shotgun 
   blasts. Eventually the alien blows up and peace is restored to the 
   city, but another added-on end crawl warns us that it may happen 
   again, maybe sooner than we think.&nbsp; It's easy to see that this 
   was a troubled production right from the start, because the direction 
   by Hooper and Cardos couldn't be more different and it sticks out 
   like a sore thumb (you can tell immediately which director shot which 
   footage). There's a lot of great genre vets in the cast (including 
   the late Casey Kasem as the police pathologist and the late John 
   Bloom as the killer; they worked together before on <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Incredible2HeadedTr">THE
    INCREDIBLE 2-HEADED TRANSPLANT</A></B> - 1970, in which Cardos was 
   the Second Unit Director) and cameos by Philip Michael Thomas as a 
   bigoted onlooker at one of the murder scenes, who is listed as 
   &quot;Corn Rows&quot; in the credits, and diminutive Angelo Rossitto 
   as a newspaper seller (who is horribly dubbed and uncredited), but 
   the film is such a jumbled mess, that is all the enjoynemt you'll 
   find here. There is some violence, but since just before The Mangler 
   attacks, the lights go out, so it's hard to make out anything. 
   There's no nudity, a smattering of comedy and some risable dialogue 
   (screenplay by Stanford Whitmore; <B><A HREF="my_old_mans_place_1971_dvd.htm">MY

   to kill the creature to avenge his partner&#146;s death. The two 
   converge at the cemetery (along with an assortment of other people) 
   to do their thing with the creature. This reviewer was rooting for 
   the creature, as every person in the cast displays a serious lack of

   Italian mystery film barely qualifies as a giallo flick, but it 
   contains some odd choices and a villain that looks like he has a 
   beard that was trimmed by a blind man (you will know what I mean when 
   you see the film). The film opens with Elizabeth (Barbara Cupisti; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Stage Fright">STAGEFRIGHT</A></B> 
   - 1987) calling her sister Anna (Marina Suma; <B><A HREF="sweets_from_a_stranger_1987.htm">SWEETS
    FROM A STRANGER</A></B> - 1987) and telling her that they need to 
   talk (they have been estranged for some time), she is leaving on a 
   long trip and need to talk to tell her something important, but Anna 
   is blow-drying her hair and doesn't hear the phone ring, Elisabeth's 
   message being recorded on<A HREF="dark_bar_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/dark bar italy poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Anna's tape answering machine. It is obvious that Elizabeth is 
   working as an expensive prostitute, as she gets a phone call telling 
   her to meet a man at an arranged time and place; her clothes for the 
   evening (which includes a red raincoat) and money being left in a 
   locker at the train station. We then see Elizabeth putting a black 
   book in a plastic bag and going to the train station to pick up the 
   bag containing the clothes and the money. She then takes a boat to 
   the island home of the mysterious Wilma (Alessandra Stordy; <B><A HREF="concorde_affaire_79_1979.htm">CONCORDE
    AFFAIRE '79</A></B> - 1979). She hides the black book under some hay 
   in a hut on Wilma's property and instead of meeting her john at the 
   arranged time and place, Elizabeth (wearing the red raincoat) goes to 
   the Dark Bar, a hipster joint full of strange people and even 
   stranger music. Elizabeth walks into the ladies room in the bar and 
   is met by a man wearing a dark overcoat, fedora and black gloves, who 
   shoots Elizabeth and locks her dead body in one of the stalls after 
   searching her body and purse for something and not finding it (care 
   to guess what it is?). Elizabeth's body is then found the following 
   morning by two horny members of the janitorial staff, who have sex in 
   the stall next to the one Elizabeth's body is in.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The film then switches to Anna, who is a trombonist in a freeform 
   jazz band, who is about to hit the &quot;big time&quot; as a solo 
   artist (A female trombone player becoming a solo artist? C'mon now!). 
   After finishing her set with the band, she goes home and listens to 
   her phone messages, hearing Elizabeth's message for the first time. 
   She calls Elizabeth, but gets no answer and becomes concerned (The 
   police eventually call her to tell her that her sister is dead), but 
   the killer and his partner now think that Anna has Elizabeth's black 
   book, which we find out is a diary. Elizabeth was forced to become a 
   prostitute for the city's largest crime syndicate, but Elizabeth 
   thought she could make a bundle of money by writing down everything 
   she knows about the syndicate, including her clients, in her diary 
   and then bribing them for a huge payday. Yes, Elizabeth was a stupid 
   broad who was always high on drugs, so her brain was not working 
   properly. She has now put her sister in danger because the two 
   killers are now after her. Anna joins forces with Elizabeth's 
   sometimes boyfriend Marco (Richard Hatch; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Leathernecks">LEATHERNECKS</A></B> 
   - 1988), who works as a projectionist at a film club, to try and find 
   the diary. We then see that Wilma has the diary (it seems Elizabeth 
   use to hide her drugs in the same place she put her diary) and she 
   has her assistant Lubka (Olivia Cupisti; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Church1989">THE
    CHURCH</A></B> - 1989) read her the last page of the diary, which 
   clues the viewer in on Elizabeth's plans to get rich. After hearing 
   it, Wilma tells Lubka to put the diary back where she found it, not 
   knowing that Elizabeth is now dead (or does she?). What follows next 
   is your standard &quot;Get the black book before the bad guys 
   do&quot;, as the two killers try to murder both Anna and Marco. It 
   seems Wilma is actually blind and Elizabeth was her drug supplier 
   (she's hooked on morphine). You see, Wilma was Elizabeth and Anna's 
   father's mistress, who killed their father in an automobile accident, 
   in which Wilma was driving and Elizabeth and Anna were in the back 
   seat. Wilma became a drug addict due to the pain medication she was 
   on from the accident and Elizabeth also became hooked when she became 
   Wilma's drug mule. It all ends at Wilma's palatial estate, where one 
   of the bad guys tries to give Wilma a hotshot, but she grabs the 
   syringe and shoves it in his eye, killing him. Anna and Marco fight 
   the other killer by the hut, accidentally setting the hut on fire, 
   destroying the diary, as Anna pumps a few bullets into the killer's 
   chest. Anna then walks into the ocean, dips her hair in the water and 
   flings her wet hair back. <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">THE END</FONT></B>. WTF?!?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While the film doesn't offer many thrills or scares, it manages to 
   entertain nonetheless, but not in a way that will sastisfy giallo 
   fans. The chief killer (Mauro Festa) and his strange beard will make 
   you look twice and Richard Hatch as Marco is the least likely hero in 
   any mystery film, as he is about as useful as tits on a rock. For 
   some reason he limps along on one leg, telling Anna that he hurt his 
   foot. I don't know if this was intentional (to give his character 
   some character) or if it was a real injury, but there is a foot chase 
   in the film that will also make you look twice as Marco limps along 
   at a fast clip trying to catch up with Anna, who is being chased by 
   the killers.. He really doesn't have much to do here and <A HREF="dark_bar_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/dark bar italy dvd front1a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="217" HEIGHT="307" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>the
    film suffers every time he is on screen (It's like he isn't trying 
   to act at all). There is also a car chase full of continuity errors, 
   as the car chasing our heroes is always a different distance away 
   with every edit. This is the second and final film for 
   director/screenwriter Stelio Fiorenza (he died in 2006), who worked 
   as an Assistant Director on director Mario Gariazzo's (a.k.a. 
   &quot;Roy Garrett&quot;) <B><A HREF="coming_of_aliens_1978.htm">VERY 
   CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE FOURTH KIND</A></B> (1978) and <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#PlayMotel1979">PLAY

   choices this film made, as Gariazzo was a notorious badfilm director, 
   who also gave us <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EerieMidnight1974">THE

    THE CATHERINE MILES STORY</A></B> (1985), among others. While I 
   wouldn't call this film bad, I would say it is ordinary in its 
   execution. There are few thrills, chills or scares, just a standard 
   chase/murder mystery, where the mystery is given away before the film 
   is even halfway through, a sin for a giallo flick. But I will say 
   this: If you have nothing better to watch, this will do in a pinch. 
   Just don't expect too much and you may enjoy yourself. There is 
   plenty of nudity, some bloody violence (the hypodermic needle in the 
   eye being the film's highlight) and some good photography (by Franco 
   Delli Colli; <B><A HREF="last_man_on_earth_1964.htm">THE LAST MAN ON EARTH</A></B>

   brain goes, that's up to you. I didn't love this film, but I didn't 
   hate it, either. It's just not remarkable in any way, but the 
   killers' choice of weapon, guns, is unusual for a giallo film, as the 
   killer usually uses some sort of bladed weapon, making the victims 
   suffer before they die. Not here, though, as they get shot and die instantly.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    I can't finish this review without mentioning the crazy song that 
   plays throughout the film. It's a jazz tune where a woman sings 
   strings of words that seems like a stream of consciousness rant. None 
   of the sentences (or stanzas, if you will) make any sense, yet it is 
   engrossing to listen to. If you decide to watch this film, you will 
   know exactly what I mean. Otherwise, the music score, by Carlo 
   Siliotto (<B><A HREF="punisher_2004.htm">THE PUNISHER</A></B> - 
   2004), is much too sedate for the film, not giving the story a chance 
   to be memorable in a way good music would. This film got very little 
   distribution outside of Italy, even though it was obviously filmed in 
   English. I could find no home video releases outside of Italy in any 
   format.&nbsp; If you want to watch the film, you can find it 
   streaming on YouTube, in a nice anamorphic widescreen print on

   (2011), and this one, the worst of the lot. After a good start set in 
   the 1930's, the film degenerates quickly once it comes forward to the 
   present, when adopted teenager Sean (Don DiGiulio) inherits a farm in 
   the West Virginia mountains from his real family and brings a bunch 
   of his obnoxious friends (his girlfriend, an interracial couple, a 
   lesbian couple, etc.) along to check it out. After constant bickering 
   between the group, some pot smoking and, of course, sex, they are 
   attacked by scarecrows come to life. Besides a couple of good gore 
   scenes (and plenty of bad ones) there's not much to recommend here. 
   Director/Writer Paul Moore, who you can plainly see is working on a 
   miniscule budget, does get some atmospheric shots on location and 
   some scares in the scarecrow attacks, but this is typical 
   cookie-cutter stuff. The scarecrows could just have well been 
   werewolves, vampires or unkillable psychos. As it stands, <B><A HREF="dark_harbor_2003b.htm">DARK

   below par. The only saving grace is some behind-the-scenes footage

   horror classic? <B><A HREF="day_of_the_dead.htm">DAY OF THE DEAD</A></B> 
   (1985) is my favorite George A. Romero zombie film and it still 
   stands up today. This was already remade as an <A HREF="short reviews.htm#DayOfTheDead2007">abysmal
    film in 2007</A> and, while this one isn't as bad as that remake, it 
   is missing something that the original had in spades: '80s blood and 
   gore, free of CGI and all practical, back when people used their 
   imagination and ingenuity to pull off bloody effects that were more 
   original than they are today. Back then, audiences could believe that 
   zombies were real, but computer effects, which don't take the law of 
   physics into consideration, make audiences feel that this could not 
   possibly happen. That is one reason where this film fails.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Besides the flashback opening, this film actually follows the 
   original's plot. Zoe (Sophie Skelton) is a medical student at a 
   teaching hospital<A HREF="day_of_the_dead_bloodline_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/day of the dead bloodline blu-ray front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="257" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>.
    When the body of an obese man who died of influenza is brought into 
   the morgue, he turns into a zombie (no explanation on why this has 
   happened). He bites Max (Johnathon Schaech; <B><A HREF="arsenal_2016.htm">ARSENAL</A></B> 
   - 2016), a pervert with a rare blood type, who tries to rape Zoe (He 
   carved her name into his wrist and shows it to Zoe, who is repulsed). 
   Within four hours, the town is crawling with zombies. Right away, we 
   know that these zombies are fast-moving and not mindless, as one 
   zombie breaks the window of a car with a rock to get to his prey 
   (Unlike zombie films of yore, when you were safe in a locked car). 
   This film also takes zombieism to new heights, as when you are 
   bitten, you don't just bleed. The initial bite causes the blood to 
   erupt out of the body like a volcano.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Five years later, Zoe is working in an underground military bunker, 
   trying to find a cure for the zombie virus. When Zoe and some 
   military personnel leave the bunker to find some meds Zoe needs for 
   the cure, they are attacked by zombies and unknowingly bring back a 
   zombie who has the smarts to hide under a military vehicle. That 
   zombie is Max (this film's &quot;Bub&quot;) who, because of his rare 
   blood type, has become half-human/half-zombie. Max is intelligent 
   enough to avoid detection and makes his way through the bunker's air 
   ducts to get to his intended goal: Zoe. Unfortunately, the rest of 
   the film is basic Horror 101, as Max picks off people one-by-one 
   before he is captured by Zoe (he wanted her to capture him). Zoe uses 
   him as a guinea pig, thinking he is the answer to reversing the 
   zombie plague. Zoe must also deal with the temperamental head of the 
   bunker, Lt. Miguel Salazar (Jeff Gum), who zigs when everyone else 
   zags (He is this film's &quot;Rhodes&quot;, who was played by Joseph 
   Pilato in the original). Max still has the hots for Zoe, refusing to 
   bite her and letting her draw his blood without fear. Zoe needs some 
   zombies to experiment on, so some military men (without Miguel's 
   permission) let some zombies in through the fence that surrounds the 
   bunker. It gets out of hand and the zombies break the perimeter, 
   surrounding the bunker, trying to find a way in.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Sadly, this film fails to generate the suspense of the original, 
   especially the ending where a horde of zombies invade the bunker and 
   Max breaks free (Unlike the original, Max doesn't even give Miguel 
   the fate he so richly deserves. Another zombie we never have seen 
   before does.). While &quot;modern&quot; audiences may find Romero's 
   film slow-going, this film glosses-over many of the sequences that 
   made the original so memorable, especially the scene where military 
   men capture zombies by putting a choke harness around their necks. 
   There is also an over-reliance on using CGI bullet squibs, especially 
   for head shots. As a matter of fact, this film is so quickly paced 
   that the audience has no time to feel sympathy or hatred for many of 
   the characters, especially when they die or turn. And, therefore, 
   that is where this film fails. Unlike the nihilistic ending of the 
   original, Zoe finds a cure and saves the world. In the canon of 
   Romero remakes, this one falls behind <B><A HREF="dawn_of_the_dead_2004.htm">DAWN
    OF THE DEAD</A></B> (2004) and <B><A HREF="crazies_2009.htm">THE CRAZIES</A></B> 
   (2010) and slightly above the 2007 remake. The fact is this film is 
   not very good, especially by making Max such an unsympathetic 
   character (he comes across as a half-zombie rapist and he talks!). 
   Bub, in the original, got a standing ovation when he saluted Rhodes 
   as zombies tore him in half. There's none of that to be found here.

   people (including Ever Carradine, Jeremy Sisto, Erik Palladino and 
   Gina Philips) get lost on a way to a wedding and end up in the town

   decide to stay the night there and end up in a Bed &amp; Breakfast 
   owned by the mysterious Mr. Wise (David Carradine [Ever's Uncle], in 
   what amount to a cameo) and run by a nasty French chef (Diedrich 
   Bader), When Bader is murdered and Mr. Wise has a heart attack and 
   dies, the Sheriff (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) demands that they all stay in 
   town until the murder is solved. When the Sheriff arrests a drifter 
   (Brent David Fraser) for the crimes, everything seems back to normal 
   except when one of the gang opens an Oriental box containing an evil 
   spirit (or &quot;Kuman Thong&quot; as it is normally known) who 
   begins possessing the townspeople. The only way to kill them is to 
   cut off their heads or shoot them in the brain (how original). Most 
   of the cast becomes possessed and it is up to the remaining three 
   survivors to stop this menace by digging up the body of Mr. Wise, 
   burning it and fashioning knives out of his bones (don't ask).

    As you can see, nearly everyone in this film could be the killer, 
   yet it is quite obvious nearly from the start of the film who the 
   killer is (The killer can't perform sexually, even with a beautiful 
   naked model in the killer's bed). The only &quot;hook&quot; this film 
   has are the masks the victims wear before they are killed. Model 
   Sabrina (Sabrina Salerno) gets out of the shower and is seen wearing 
   an insect mask. The killer seals-up her apartment and releases a 
   swarm of killer bees, which sting Sabrina to death. Otherwise, the 
   film is a loooong 94 minutes. The acting is horrendous (especially by 
   Karl Zinny, an obvious red herring, who smiles and laughs at all the 
   wrong times. He is simply horrible.), the giallo elements old hat 
   (The clues are in the photographs. Paging Dario Argento!) and the 
   mystery is not interesting and uninvolving. If it weren't for the 
   frequent nudity on view, I would have lost interest almost 
   immediately. The music, by Simon Boswell (Argento's <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Phenomena1984">PHENOMENA</A></B> 
   - 1984), is particularly grating, as it goes from soft rock and '80s 
   faux-New Wave to ear-piercing hard rock, causing severe headaches. 
   This is probably Boswell's worst music score. The screenplay, by 
   Gianfranco Clerici (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NewYorkRipper1982">THE
    NEW YORK RIPPER</A></B> - 1982) and Daniele Stroppa (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Witchery">WITCHERY</A></B> 
   - 1988) is nothing but giallo genre cliches (making everyone look as 
   guilty as possible) and the unmasking (if it were) of the killer 
   would only surprise a child. I have always said that director 
   Lamberto Bava ran hot and cold and this film, shot under the title <B><A HREF="delirium_photo_of_gioia_1987_foreign_ads.htm">LE
    FOTO DI GIOIA</A></B> (the title on the print is simply 
   &quot;Delirium&quot;), is the coldest film of his career. Even when 
   he films one long chase scene in a single take, it seems like nothing 
   but leftover Argento. The only unintentional laugh I had was when the 
   killer receives a shotgun blast to the groin and a doctor tells a 
   hospitalized Gloria, &quot;He'll need a wheelchair for the rest of 
   his life&quot;, which then sets up the &quot;surprise&quot; <B><A HREF="carrie_1976.htm">CARRIE</A></B>-like

   - 1984), who tells them that he is not a &quot;witch doctor&quot; but 
   someone who gained the power of ESP and has helped many police 
   departments find missing persons. He goes into Emily's bedroom and 
   begins to act strange, ripping one of Emily's pillows apart. He then 
   begins to see through the killer's eyes and tells the parents that 
   they are dealing with an &quot;aberration of the species&quot;&nbsp; 
   and other things that don't make much sense (I doubt even Mitchell 
   understood what he was saying!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    In what seems to be a scene from another film (this film tells three 
   or more stories that never link together),&nbsp; a girl leaving a 
   disco (where we see people boogieing down to Lipps, Inc.'s song 
   &quot;Funky Town&quot;) is assaulted in an alley by the killer, but 
   he is stopped from killing her by two motorcyclists who race down the 
   alley. The killer knocks one off his bike and it explodes (it hits 
   the wall ever-so-gently and explodes, like a 1979 Ford Pinto!). We 
   then switch to Emily's father, who asks Carson if his daughter is 
   alive. All his is able to get is some random gobbledegook, telling 
   him this about the killer, &quot;He is less than a man and more, much 
   more than a man&quot; (WTF?!?) and hands him drawings he made when he 
   saw through the killer's eyes (which would not make a grade-schooler 
   jealous!). One drawing interests Mr. Parker (of a cheap boarding 
   house) and he goes there, only to have the killer murder him. We then 
   see two boys playing with walkie-talkies in a park, when they scream, 
   discovering a female skeleton in a tree (I guess it is supposed to be 
   Emily's but the film doesn't let us know whether it is or it isn't, 
   but what happens next tells us it probably is).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In the scene I was talking about in the beginning of the review, 
   Carson goes to Mrs. Parker to pay his respect, when she pulls out a 
   revolver and shoots him between the eyes! We never know if she is 
   grief-stricken or just mad at Carson for not finding her daughter 
   alive and causing the death of her husband, but she says something 
   like. &quot;I bet you never saw this coming&quot; before shooting him 
   (I believe there is a third reason: Mitchell had a one or two day 
   shooting schedule and the production couldn't afford to shoot the 
   remaining scenes as written because Mitchell would have demanded more 
   money). The middle third of the film really drags as we are 
   introduced to pre-school teachers (and cousins) Mary (Jennifer 
   Holmes; <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#Raw Force">RAW FORCE</A></B> - 
   1981; also with Cameron Mitchell) and Jo (Zoli Markey). We get to 
   know more than we ever need to know about their private and love 
   lives (too much, if you ask me) and it is obvious that they are just 
   meat for the killer's plate. But which one will survive?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Public Domain (PD) film contains long stretches of nothingness, 
   followed by non-bloody violence (the killer uses his gloves, but we 
   never see the result of their use). In the film's favor, there is 
   plenty of female nudity and some good camerawork (the 360&#176; pan 
   around the outside of Mary's house is really effective), as is 
   Mitchell's shocking death but, like I said, that was probably never 
   scripted and was a budget necessity. The only person we can blame for 
   this meandering piece of horror filmmaking is 
   director/producer/screenwriter Percival Rubens (<B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#SurvivalZone1982">SURVIVAL
    ZONE</A></B> - 1982), who doesn't even bother to give us a reason 
   why the killer is doing this, he just kills for no rhyme or reason. 
   Also making matters confusing is that the killer wears a white mask, 
   but in some scenes, he is seen not wearing the mask and then wearing 
   it again. I don't know if Rubens was going for something supernatural 
   or if it was just lazy filmmaking, but the finale, where Mary kills 
   the menace, by stabbing him in the neck with scissors and he falls 
   (slowly) into the bathtub, it is plain to see he is not wearing the 
   mask, but when the camera lingers on him for the <A HREF="demon_1979_mask_photos.htm">closing
    shot</A>, he is wearing it, causing Mary to scream. If it is 
   supposed to mean something, it got lost in the translation from page 
   to screen. The only good thing I can say about this film is that 
   Craig Gardner, who played Jo's rich boyfriend Dean Turner, is very 
   good. We get invested in their relationship, only to have them 
   uncerimoniously killed by the Demon (Is he a demon???). There is also 
   a lot of talk about meditation and out of body experiences (OOBE), 
   topics which were popular when this film was made, but doesn't help 
   this film's languid pacing. But there is something about this film 
   that makes me watch it when I can't decide on what to view. I don't 
   know whether I hope to find something nice to say about it or whether 
   I am just a masochist, but I have seen this film at least a dozen 
   times and still have the same opinion about it. Not good, but not 
   awful, either. It just is.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Jenny Cooper (Charlotte Lewis; <B><A HREF="golden_child_1986.htm">THE

   amateur psychic who dials a wrong number and gets a room full of 
   cobweb-filled reel-to-reel tape recorders that suddenly come to life, 
   somehow killing a cleaning woman who hears the phone ringing and 
   picks it up. Jenny starts receiving a series of strange phone calls 
   that affect her life dramatically. One phone call shatters a mirror 
   in front of her and another phone call kills all the fish in a large 
   tank in her apartment. She rightfully becomes creeped out and asks 
   next door neighbor Riccardo (Marcello Modugno; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#YoullDieMidnight86">YOU'LL

   strange ringtone, causing Carlo to walk out to the apartment building 
   roof in a trance, where he tries to commit suicide by jumping off the 
   roof, but Jenny saves him in the nick of time, slapping the shit out 
   of him until he snaps out of the trance. Jenny then asks a phone 
   company friend to check out the phone system in her apartment complex 
   to see if anything unusual is going on. He, indeed, finds something 
   strange, it's like everyone in the world is talking on the same line

   Jenny, she escapes once again. Riccardo does some research at the 
   university and discovers that a certain Professor Irving Klein 
   (William Berger; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#SpiderLabyrinth1988">THE
    SPIDER LABYRINTH</A></B> - 1988) can help Jenny, as he believes 
   there is an &quot;energy&quot; in this world that is unknown and 
   deadly and once it attaches itself to a person, there is little that 
   can be done to make it go away. Jenny and Riccardo meet the Professor 
   at the airport, but before he can help Jenny, the energy attacks, 
   exploding the pacemaker out of the Professor's chest! The energy then 
   starts to &quot;play&quot; with Jenny sexually, making her writhe 
   around in the bathtub (in her underwear) in a sexual frenzy. When 
   Riccardo knocks on the bathroom door, it snaps Jenny out of her 
   trance and she jumps out of the bathtub just before an electric phone 
   comes flying through the bathroom window and lands in the bathtub

   - 1985) plays everything that happens here seriously, which is why 
   this film doesn't work. The idea of common electric appliances 
   turning deadly is certainly not a new idea, as the film <B><A HREF="pulse_1988.htm">PULSE</A></B> 
   (1988) showed us (and it was done so much better than this film), but 
   the lack of a proper explanation on why this is happening and the 
   serious tone are the film's biggest distractions. It also doesn't 
   help that the characters within this film do the stupidest things 
   possible at the worse times, such as Jenny using the phone at the 
   airport after meeting the Professor, which causes his death. I mean, 
   if you are so scared of the phone, why would you use one??? The 
   screenplay, by Deodato and husband and wife team Joseph &amp; Mary 
   Cavara (their only film credit), is full of&nbsp; stupid people doing 
   idiotic things, which makes this film a waste of celluloid. It isn't 
   even good for an unintentional laugh. Add to that a total lack of 
   nudity (although the beautiful Charlotte Lewis walks around in a 
   minimal amount of clothing) and you'll be saying, &quot;Why 
   bother?&quot; It should be noted that a couple of deaths are gory and 
   you will see some electric appliances do things they were never meant 
   to do (A ceiling fan drops to the floor and keeps spinning, trying to 
   stop Riccardo from saving Jenny by cutting his legs off at the ankles 
   [but failing]; phones of all types doing acrobatic stunts; and other 
   awfulness), but it's all done without a hint of imagination or 
   pinache, making this film a chore to sit through. So, what does this 
   energy want from Jenny, you may ask? It seems all it wanted Jenny to 
   do was call a certain number and tell the energy that she 
   &quot;loves&quot; it! That's what she does and then the film ends. I 
   mean, what the fuck?!? I was tempted to throw my remote at my TV 
   screen, but that would be like blaming a TV for showing a shitty 
   film! Do yourself a favor, treat your phone like a human being (in 
   this age of cell phones, some people treat them better than they do 
   people!) and avoid this film at all costs.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   has nothing to do with Lovecraft but is still enjoyable nonetheless. 
   During a heavy storm, a group of people with widely variable 
   personalities take shelter in an old mansion run by an old doll maker 
   (Guy &quot;<B><A HREF="mr_sardonicus_1961.htm">MR. SARDONICUS</A></B>&quot;

   his dolls have a life of their own, made possible by the kindly old 
   dollmaker's secret process. The dolls kill anyone who intend to harm 
   the old man, his wife or the house. This is actually a fairy tale 
   gone out of control, as anyone (besides children), that does not 
   retain their child-like innocence, is systematically dispatched by 
   the dolls. Hate, deceit, thievery and wickedness brings death, while 
   love, trust and innocence brings a life of happiness. Although this 
   film gets rather bloody in spots (some doll attacks are graphic), you 
   feel these people are getting what they deserve. The doll attacks, 
   using stop-motion animation (by Dave Allen) and puppets, are 
   convincing and well-done, unlike the effects for the <B><A HREF="puppet_master_3_toulons_revenge_1991.htm">PUPPET

   Once again I had to raid my VHS library to review a film that is not 
   yet on DVD or Blu-Ray (at the time of this review). I think I know 
   why. This Italian horror film is so lethargically paced, it would tax 
   the patience of a snail covered in molasses.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Turin, 1955: We watch as two men fight, while a woman screams at 
   them to stop because the house is making them fight. One man stabs 
   the other to death and the woman pulls the knife out of the body and 
   stabs the other man in the back, killing him. Then a red light 
   appears in the room (supposedly telling us that the house is haunted) 
   and the woman runs outside into a graveyard. A hand shoots up out of 
   a grave, grabs the woman by the leg and pulls her underground to her doom.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Turin, To-Day (Their spelling, not mine): Lawyer Ugo Ressia 
   (Jean-Pierre Aumont; <B><A HREF="cauldron_of_blood_1970.htm">CAULDRON 
   OF BLOOD</A></B> - 1970) draws up a will where the haunted house and 
   the woman's fortune will be split between three relatives, daughter 
   Elisa (Ann Gregs; <B><A HREF="teenage_prostitution_racket_1975_italy_ads.htm">TEENAGE

   and Bruno (Foster Bards; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Rats">RATS: 
   NIGHT OF TERROR</A></B> - 1983). There is one major stipulation: All 
   of them must live in the house and it can never be sold or altered in 
   any way. Elisa is somewhat of an enigma. She<A HREF="dont_look_in_the_attic_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/don't look in the attic vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="191" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   never knew her mother (she disappeared when she was very young) and 
   may have psychic powers. Tony and Bruno haven't talked to each other 
   in years and they have never met their cousin Elisa. At the reading 
   of the will, they meet each other for the first time at Ugo's office, 
   along with Bruno's wife Sonia (Helen Frasson; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#KillerNun1978">KILLER
    NUN</A></B> - 1979). When they all arrive at the house, they meet 
   the creepy gardener Phillip (Paul Teitcheid), who has been living in 
   the house ever since Elisa's mother disappeared. That night, Sonia 
   has a nightmare where she witnesses her own death and she begs Bruno 
   to leave the house, which he shoots down. Her screams wake up 
   everyone else and Elisa accuses Tony of skulking by her bedroom door, 
   but he denies it. Elisa also hears her mother calling to her, telling 
   her to come to her tomb (If she disappeared, why does she have a tomb?).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It becomes apparent that Bruno wants the house and the fortune for 
   himself. He fosters bad blood between Elisa and Tony by telling her 
   that Tony wants to marry her (unlike this country, Italy has no 
   problem with cousins marrying). Bruno also wants to have a baby with 
   Sonia, but Sonia tells Elisa that her husband is sterile (he doesn't 
   know it...yet). That night Bruno accuses Sonia of being barren and 
   later, she sleepwalks out of the house and gets hit by a car, her 
   face going through the windshield (just like in her nightmare). 
   There's also a subplot where Ugo's partner, defense lawyer Casati 
   (George Ardisson; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Eyes Behind Stars">EYES
    BEHIND THE STARS</A></B> - 1977), and his mistress Martha (Beba

   killed by Casati!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This film is the pits, as the dubbing is horrendous. The line 
   readings are so strange, you'll be shaking your head in disbelief and 
   wondering if English was a second language for the dubbing artists, 
   especially when Bruno, after just losing his wife, asks Elisa to 
   marry him and, when he tries to rape Elisa, she tells him he is 
   sterile! I hardly think that is the time to mention that point. The 
   film also makes very little sense, as the screenplay offers no 
   answers to the littany of questions it delivers, such as: Is this 
   house really haunted? Why is there a cemetery in the front yard? What 
   is Elisa's mother's name (her gravestone is blank)? Why does Beba 
   Loncar get top billing when she is only in the film for about five 
   minutes? Why do my loud farts turn into hard gas?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   appearance at the end of the film as an escaped mental patient shot 
   dead after trying to kill his daughter (played by real-life daughter 
   Verkina Flower). Someone is killing the patrons of the local drive-in 
   with a sword. Heads are sliced off, necks are slashed and other 
   various body parts are impaled. Two detectives (James Barnes and Adam 
   Lawrence) are put on the case and stake out the drive-in for 
   suspects. The manager (and ex-knife thrower) Atkin (Newton Naushaus), 
   ex-circus geek and sword-swallower turned janitor Germy (Douglas 
   Gudbye) and peeping tom Orville (Norman Sherlock) are the prime 
   suspects as still more patrons turn up dead. The fact is, none of 
   these people had anything to do with the killings as they are all 
   dead by the end of the film, the killer never caught and unmasked. A 
   voiceover at the end of the film notifies the audience that a 
   murderer is loose in the theatre. The film has the look of a mid-70's 
   porno feature, with bare bone sets, a droning synthesizer score and 
   grainy photography. This actually adds to the charm of the movie. 
   There are some bloody killings, especially in the beginning, to keep 
   gorehounds occupied and some nudity to keep exploitation fans happy. 
   But the screenplay has some funny bits, like when one of the 
   detectives dresses as a woman to go undercover at the drive-in and 
   gets stares and remarks from various people that are downright 
   hilarious. If you go in with expectations not set at high, you may

    The film opens in Paris, France, with fourth year surgery intern 
   Jean (Juan Logar, who also wrote this film's screenplay as well as 
   directing/writing the giallo film <B><A HREF="two_males_for_alexa_1971.htm">TWO
    MALES FOR ALEXA</A></B> - 1971) asking a surgeon if his new wife, 
   Jacqueline (Annie Sinigalia), is going to be okay after her surgery, 
   It seems Jacqueline was attacked&nbsp; by some psychopath who was 
   never caught, leaving her in very serious condition when she was 
   brought to the hospital. The surgeon tells Jean not to worry, he has 
   the best hands in the business and Jacqueline will be fine. As Jean 
   is in the waiting room, anxiously waiting for some good news, we see 
   flashbacks of Jean and Jacqueline's whirlwind romance. Jean is so 
   much in love with Jacqueline that he wants to marry her right away, 
   not wanting to wait until he becomes a certified surgeon. He tells 
   Jacqueline he will be a good father to her four-year-old son 
   Andr&eacute; (Eduardo Alberto) and he loves her more than she could 
   ever know. Jacqueline tries to talk him into waiting until he 
   graduates, but Jean is so much in love with her, he will not take no 
   for an answer. He tells her he will plant a rose bush in his garden 
   (red roses are her favorite flowers) and will give her a freshly cut 
   rose every day to prove his love to her. They get married (offscreen) 
   and we see Jean, Jacqueline and Andr&eacute; enjoying themselves in a 
   Paris square, looking at paintings from different artists, while the 
   camera swirls around (and some strange POV shots are seen, such as an 
   artist applying paint to a painting, where the camera lens is the 
   painting), showing us that the new groom, his bride and their young 
   son are very happy. That happiness is about to end. When the surgeon 
   comes out of the operating room, he callously tells Jean that 
   Jacqueline died on the operating table and quickly walks away. A few 
   months pass, and we see Jean is visiting his parents at their mansion 
   (they are rich). Jean's father (Tom&aacute;s Blanco; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#FeastOfSatan">THE
    FEAST OF SATAN</A></B> - 1971) is not happy that his son has quit

   of Jacqueline. Andr&eacute; is living with Jean's parents and the 
   father wants to send him to a boarding school so Jean can get on with 
   his life. What his parents don't realize is that the sullen Jean's 
   mind has snapped and he is now killing surgeons by slitting their 
   necks with a &quot;surgery axe&quot; and then using the instrument to 
   cut off both their hands, his twisted mind believing by doing so they 
   will never kill anyone in the operating room. Oh, and he also 
   believes that Jacqueline is alive and will be joining him and 
   Andr&eacute; to live happily ever after!</FONT></FONT><BR>

   (&Aacute;ngel Soler), looking at a new murder victim in a park with 
   his hands cut off, the third such victim in just a few weeks. The 
   only clue that they have is what the medical examiner tells them 
   about the two bodies before; that they were killed with a very sharp 
   surgical instrument and the killer may belong to the medical 
   profession. The Commissioner tells Naschy that he wants this case 
   solved and solved soon, but no one has any idea that they are dealing 
   with Jean and he's quite crafty, as well as being mad as a hatter. We 
   then see Jean at his parents' summer house in the country, where he 
   and Jacqueline lived once they were married. He opens a trick door 
   and grabs his briefcase (which contains his kill kit) and goes to the 
   house of a friend from medical school he hasn't seen in over a year. 
   We then watch as Jean kills that friend by slicing his throat with 
   the surgical axe and then chopping off his hands with the instrument 
   (although we don't actually see him cut off the hands, we do see a 
   bloody severed hand on a table), placing the hands in his briefcase

   that something is wrong with Jean, telling Jean she will try and help 
   him any way she can. But Jean is too far gone for any professional 
   help, as when his friends turn on the radio and start dancing, Jean 
   loses it and yells for everyone to leave his home. He then apologizes 
   and they all go to a disco for some drinking and dancing, but it is 
   obvious Jean is not having any fun, seeing couples enjoying each 
   other's company and having a good time, so Jean leaves unannounced 
   and goes home, picks up his briefcase, drives to the hospital where 
   Jacqueline died, sneaks into a laboratory where a surgeon is working 
   and kills him, chopping off his hands and putting them in his 
   briefcase for burial in his garden. Detective Naschy and the 
   Commissioner get closer to catching the killer by interviewing the 
   hospital's director (&Aacute;ngel Celdr&aacute;n) and asking him for 
   names of former disgruntled employees who may have a motive for 
   killing surgeons and cutting off their hands with surgical proficiency.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While his father is away on business, Jean's mother pays her son a

   asking herself why her son is acting so strangely. She goes to the 
   garden and notices a strange smell coming from the rose bush. She 
   starts digging and discovers the severed hands buried in the dirt. 
   Jean then appears and his mother has a heart attack, losing her sense 
   of speech and paralyzed on the right side of her body. He brings his

   for her to recover, but Jean tells the doctor and her trusty 
   manservant (Antonio Jim&eacute;nez Escribano; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#GraveyardHorror1971">GRAVEYARD
    OF HORROR</A></B> - 1971) that he alone will take care of her and no 
   one will be allowed to see her. When they are alone, Jean tells his 
   mother why he is killing and he is just waiting for Jacqueline to 
   return to him, so they and Andr&eacute; can finally be a family 
   again. He also tells Mom that she will be joining them, as she is too 
   important to leave behind. Jean then leaves and tells the manservant 
   that his mother is not to be disturbed under any circumstances. 
   Mother, however, is too disturbed&nbsp; to just lie in her bed, so 
   she manages to squirm out of bed, drag herself to a bookshelf and 
   write something in the opening pages of a book, leaving it open on 
   the floor for the manservant to discover. Things don't turn out for 
   the best, though, as the manservant discovers her lying on the floor, 
   puts her back to bed and picks up the book and closes it without 
   reading what she wrote.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Things come to a nasty end when Jean sneaks into Pierre's home and 
   kills him in his usual manner. When Fanny discovers Pierre's handless 
   body, she calls the police. Jean leaves Pierre's house so quickly, he 
   forgot the briefcase containing Pierre's hands. The manservant begins 
   to notice that Jean is not being himself, finally opens up the book 
   and discovers what Jean's mother wrote (&quot;My son is crazy. My son 
   is crazy.&quot;) and calls the police. Jean kidnaps Andr&eacute; and 
   his mother and brings them to the country estate. When he realizes he 
   forgot his briefcase, he drives back to Pierre's house to retrieve 
   it, but the police are already there, so he drives back home. Henry 
   and Susan, along with Fanny, tell the police about Jean's strange 
   behavior and that, along with briefcase and the butler's phone call, 
   Detective Naschy comes to the conclusion that Jean is the serial 
   killer, so they all go to the country estate to capture him. When 
   they arrive, Jean kills Fanny, grabs Andr&eacute; and runs into the 
   woods, saying that he and Andre will be joining Jacqueline now 
   (meaning he is going to kill the young boy). When Detective Naschy 
   confronts Jean in the woods, Andr&eacute; escapes and a wrestling 
   match ensues, resulting in Jean battering Detective Naschy with his 
   bare hands and finishing him off by throwing a large rock on his 
   head, crushing Naschy's dome (offscreen). Andre rushes into the arms 
   of Henry and Susan and the Commissioner and his men shoot Jean to 
   death. He can now join Jacqueline for all eternity, that is if he 
   isn't sent to Hell first. <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">THE END</FONT></B>.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    FACES DEATH</A></B> - 1969; one of three people to direct this 
   troubled production), is a lot more graphic than most films from this 
   period. While we never actually see Jean cutting off the hands, there 
   are many shots of bloody severed hands here, both in and out of his 
   briefcase, as well as him cutting the throats of his victims. 
   Screenwriter Juan Logar's portrayal of Jean (He lists his name simply 
   as &quot;Juan&quot; in both the acting and screenwriting credits) is 
   pretty good. While he seems kind of vanilla in the beginning of the 
   film (compared to the flashbacks, where we see him as a vibrant human 
   being in love), the viewer begins to slowly acknowledge that this is 
   simply a broken man who cannot be repaired under any circumstances, 
   neither by Susan's psychiatric offerings or any other manner of help. 
   He is beyond help and Juan registers in his role (He better, he wrote 
   it!). Paul Naschy's role is basically nothing but an extended cameo. 
   He really offers nothing to advance the plot because it is the 
   Commissioner who issues the orders, not him. Still, Naschy should be 
   recognized here because it's the first film role of his where he gets 
   his name in the credits (even if he uses the &quot;David Molba&quot; 
   pseudonym). Most reference resources (including the IMDb) list this 
   as a 1968 production, but the opening credits list it as a 1966 
   production (The Spanish have a unique way of copyrighting their 
   films, you just have to know where to look for it. Most copyright 
   dates from other countries are listed last during the end credits, 
   but Spanish productions usually list them during the opening 
   credits.). A lot of reference sites also list this film as a Giallo, 
   but it's not. We already know who the killer is and this has hardly 
   any Giallo staples and plays more like a straight-ahead thriller. 
   This is a perfectly fine way to spend 85 minutes of your time, 
   watching a man going off the deep end and murdering those he think 
   deserves it. I know I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. It 
   should be noted that the cinematographer of this film was Ra&uacute;l 
   Artigot, who would go on to direct <B><A HREF="witches_mountain_1971.htm">THE

   (1989) - </B>Why the HELL do I keep doing this to myself? I see the

   toilet after putting it into a pillowcase!) to produce the now 
   teenage Kirsten (Julie Austin), who he plans on mating with the elf 
   to produce a new Master Race! Since Kirsten's grandfather is also her 
   father, it's no wonder that she is so fucked-up. The murderous elf (a 
   ridiculous puppet whose mouth never moves) invades the department 
   store and begins killing the inhabitants (including the original 
   store Santa, who has his nuts cut off while snorting coke in a 
   bathroom stall), which also includes a group of Neo-Nazis sent to 
   retrieve Kirsten and impregnate her by using the elf. Santa Haggerty 
   gets in the middle and helps Kirsten escape (including one of the 
   lamest shootouts recorded on film) and retrieve a red crystal; the 
   only object that can stop the elf and send him back to Hell. It's 
   hard to tell if this film was actually made as a comedy, as 
   director/writer Jeff Mandel (<B><A HREF="robo_chic_1988.htm">ROBO-C.H.I.C.</A></B> 
   - 1988) can't seem to make up his mind if the line readings are to be 
   taken seriously (they're all over the place) and the action is about 
   as exciting as watching paint dry. At least we get to see a kid piss 
   on Haggerty's lap (and who hasn't wanted to do that?) while he is 
   playing Santa (he's also Associate Producer of this turd). There's 
   also only one elf in this film, which makes it hard to accept the 
   title and the deceptive back cover of the video box. One wonders who 
   Dan Haggerty owns in Hollywood (perhaps he has photos of some 
   Hollywood agent blowing one of his male clients or maybe he just 
   blows his agent?) as he's about as animated as a piece of driftwood 
   and has the charm of that Uncle you always hated but had to invite 
   over your house during the holidays as not to piss-off your other 
   relatives (&quot;Now we all know your Uncle Danny has problem with

    Beneath the canals of Venice lurks a maniac who kidnaps beautiful 
   women, embalms them and then poses their bodies in his personal 
   &quot;Temple of Beauty&quot;, a creepy underground crypt where they 
   stand side-by-side in white gowns. &quot;You will stay with me 
   always. No one else will have you!&quot;, says the maniac, continuing 
   with, &quot;You will be my godesses, my idols...forever!&quot; The 
   killer, who hides his identity by wearing a scuba diver outfit when 
   he kidnaps the women and a skull mask and hooded robe when he is not 
   in the water, is hunted by the police and newspaper reporter Andrea 
   (&quot;Gin Mart&quot; Real name: Luigi Martocci). Andrea pesters the 
   Commissioner of Police (Alcide Gazzotto) constantly to find out why 
   all these young women are disappearing (We know who the next female 
   victim will be because they are denoted by a close-up and freeze 
   frame for a couple of seconds, this film's &quot;hook&quot;). Andrea 
   meets Miss Marie (Maureen Lidgard Brown), a young tour group guide, 
   and he escorts her and her group (mostly beautiful young women) to 
   their hotel. One of the pretty young tourists, Grace (Alba Brotto), 
   is unable to get a room on the same floor as her friends, making her 
   a prime candidate as an addition to the killer's Temple of Beauty. We 
   must try to figure out who the killer is (he is never called &quot;The
    Embalmer&quot; once in the film), as almost every male (not 
   including Andrea) has secrets they would rather not share with anyone 
   else. Is it the Police Commissioner? How about the rich industrialist 
   (Elmo Caruso), who hopes to modernize Venice (destroying its ancient 
   beauty)? How about the bishop (Carlo Russo; church figures are almost 
   always villains in giallo flicks)? Or is it the hotel manager, Mr. 
   Torre (Gaetano Dell'Era)? What about the Professor (Luciano Gasper), 
   who is the only male member of the tour group? And, finally, could it 
   be Andrea's dentally challenged co-worker (Pietro Walter)?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;At
    the hotel's nightclub, you'll see such crazy sights as an elderly 
   skinny woman (Anita Todesco) doing the twist (she says she is only 
   42, but she has to be twice that age!) and an Elvis Presley wannabe 
   (Roberto Contero), who suddenly appears in a coffin (!) and starts 
   plucking his giutar and singing a song that is clearly not what we 
   are hearing on the soundtrack! We also see Andrea and Miss Marie 
   dancing cheek-to-cheek while salsa music plays! We then watch the 
   technique the Embalmer uses to prepare his women for his Temple of 
   Beauty. It involves a &quot;secret formula&quot; he injects into 
   their veins to stave-off the decomposition process. But why is he 
   doing this?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then find out why Grace was given that room. The hotel manager 
   installed a two-way mirror in the room so he could watch women get 
   undressed and take a bath, all from the comfort of his office. The 
   Professor discovers an important clue in the hotel's basement and, 
   that night, his dead body is discovered in the singer's coffin, a 
   knife sticking out of his chest. Andrea does some investigating and 
   discovers a secret tunnel in the hotel basement, next to the 
   Professor's pipe and a pool of blood. We know the Embalmer walks 
   freely around Venice, as the camera pans down to his shiny black 
   shoes while he picks out his next female victim. Who can it be? I'll 
   never tell because this film is whacked-out, never giving us a reason 
   why he is doing it (OK, it's the rich industrialist!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    people's mouths especially when the singer makes his initial 
   appearance at the hotel's nightclub (This hotel has it all and I 
   wondered why tourists would stay there because there is no reason to 
   tour Venice when everything is at the hotel!). It comes so far out of 
   left field and his song is so awful, you'll be wondering how he got 
   the job in the first place. It's obvious this was the first time he 
   held a guitar because his fingering makes no sense. Since this is a 
   mid-'60s production, there is no nudity. When Grace takes a bath, all 
   we see is her shadow projected on a wall as she takes off her 
   clothes. There are also two comic fishermen who only talk about wine 
   or getting drunk. There is some nice Venice scenery, but the mystery 
   is not that engrossing. This was director/co-screenwriter Dino 
   Tavella's last film (he only directed one other film) before he 
   passed away in 1969 at the age of 49. Very little is known about

   I just love Australian horror films. Sure, there's been some bad 
   ones, but the majority of them knock anything made in America clear 
   out of the water. This one is no exception. In the opening prologue, <A HREF="encounter_at_ravens_gate_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/encounter at raven's gate vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="174" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>an
    object is discoverered to have landed at the small town of Raven's 
   Gate and a Government inspector is sent out to take a look. He finds 
   a cop searching a burned-out house and the film flashes back to five 
   days earlier. Some type of electrical surge has begun to stall out 
   cars, kill birds while they are flying, and change people attitudes 
   until they become murderous. This electrical surge also empties-out a 
   half-full water tank instantly, turns domesticated animals into 
   killers and murders an elderly couple by frying them alive. What 
   exactly is doing this and why? The answer is hard to find in this 
   film (but the pieces are there if you look hard enough), but it is 
   entertaining with it's colorful characters (an ex-con who stole a 
   police car, a homicidal cop who is in love with the same woman as the 
   ex-con and a hortculturist who cares more about the water supply than 
   he does people). The desolate, dry landscape and some really tense 
   situations add to the strange allure of this film. 
   Director/Producer/Writer Rolf De Heer (<B><A HREF="bad_boy_bubby_1993.htm">BAD
    BOY BUBBY</A></B> - 1993) builds up suspense without catering to the 
   gorehound crowd (although there is some shocking bits of blood and 
   unexpected violence). It's a film that actually makes you think for a 
   change and that is a film that's hard to come by, especially for the 
   horror genre. It enigmatic (but not as enigmatic as a David Lynch 
   film) and makes you take a long, hard look at what lengths the 
   Government will go to to cover up whatever is out there. The final 
   scene will bear me out. If you're in the mood for something 
   different, this film will do the trick nicely. Starring Steven 
   Vidler, Celine O'Leary, Ritchie Singer, Vincent Gil and Saturday

   Mark Buntzman is no James Glickenhaus. Imagine making an action 
   exploitation film with very little blood or gore and throw in 
   characters you don't give a damn about, but you really should. At 
   least the original had some wit, charm and imaginative deaths (not to 
   mention one hell of a decapitation). The sequel has none of this, 
   unless you like seeing people on fire and burning to death. The late 
   Robert Ginty returns from the original as John Eastland, and he still 
   is acting like a vigilante, walking around the alleys and back 
   streets of New York City with a flame-thrower strapped to his back, 
   frying would-be thieves and street scum, including the brother of

   They go after X and his gang and I guess I don't have to tell you the 
   rest.&nbsp; I remember seeing this film in a theater and then renting 
   the VHS and thinking to myself, &quot;Man, the editing sucks in this 
   film.&quot; That may be because triple-threat Mark Buntzman (this is 
   his only directorial effort) didn't know how to end a scene (you know 
   there had to be some production trouble when the closing credits say 
   &quot;Additional scenes directed by William Sachs&quot;, who reshot 
   much of the footage when Cannon Films was not satisfied with 
   Buntzman's final cut). Some scenes just end without explanation and 
   leave you scratching your head and it looks like Cannon Films (the 
   theatrical distributor of this film in the U.S.) had to make some 
   severe cuts in the violence department to receive an R-Rating. The 
   VHS tape, released by <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#MGM/UA">MGM-UA
    Home Video</A> is the same theatrical version. Maybe someday this 
   film will get an uncut release on DVD (it's still not available on

   this film a thumbs-down. I may raise my thumb into the upright

   (Mehmet Gunsur, who is a pill-popper) and Lawrence &quot;Don't call 
   me Larry&quot; Kellog (R. Keith Harris) show up and don't believe a 
   thing Christie says, until she mentions that The Picasso Killer 
   carved a sideways &quot;V&quot; into the stomach of the victim (It's 
   put out there that an FBI profiler believes that the sideways 
   &quot;V&quot; represents that the women mean &quot;much less than 
   him&quot; [the killer].). Since this aspect of the killer's MO was 
   never reported to the news, the cops finally believe her, but 
   wouldn't you know it, a rolling blackout hits the area and everyone 
   is trapped in the building (The outside doors are locked by Wade, the 
   phones don't work, cellphones don't work because the towers don't 
   have power and the cops' radios don't work because the repeaters also 
   have no power). The Picasso Killer then begins to kill everyone in 
   the building one-by-one, including a couple screwing in an office 
   (What would Christmas Eve be without one of those?), a cleaning lady 
   (her face is cut in half), Wade and Lawrence, before Christie manages 
   to throw him off the roof. This being a modern DTV film, there's a 
   &quot;surprise&quot; ending where The Picasso Killer isn't dead (How 
   he survived the long fall without a scratch is never explained) and 
   goes to Christie's home, where he kills the babysitter and tells 
   Christie's young daughter that he'll be coming for her mother soon, 
   because she's &quot;not ready&quot; to become one of his 
   masterpieces. Oh boy, another film left wide-open for a sequel!&nbsp; 
   Udo Kier is quite good as the killer, humming and singing Christmas 
   songs as he hunts down his prey (I like that he sang &quot;Oh, 
   Tannenbaum&quot;, rather than &quot;Oh, Christmas Tree&quot; since he 
   is German) and telling Christie that he will cut out her tongue and 
   use it as a brush to paint, but director Jon Keeyes (<B><A HREF="living_and_dying_2007.htm">LIVING
    &amp; DYING</A></B> - 2007) and screenwriter Roy Sallows (<B><A HREF="shadow_zone_the_undead_express_1996.htm">SHADOW

   the plate, failing to explain The Picasso Killer's motivations 
   (besides a couple of childhood photos which left me scratching my 
   head) and why there is a series of rolling blackouts happening 
   throughout the city (especially during the Winter). But Udo Kier 
   saves the film, because everytime he is on-screen stalking and 
   talking, it sends shivers down your spine. He just has that kind of 
   voice where he could read the telephone book and make it sound scary. 
   By no means a good film, but anything with Udo Kier in such a big 
   role is worth watching. Also starring Monica Dean, Austin James,

   that she died of &quot;melancholy&quot; and is buried in the castle's 
   family crypt. The Count takes her to the family crypt, telling 
   her&nbsp; a history of her ancestors. He then tells her that her 
   mother died in 1944 and it upsets Sylvia. We also notice that Sylvia 
   looks just like her grandmother, Malenka, her portrait hanging on a 
   castle wall.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    That night, Sylvia is visited in her bedroom by Blinka (Adriana

    AGENT SUPER DRAGON</A></B> - 1966), who tells Sylvia that she is in 
   love with the Count, who is over 100 years old. Blinka also tells 
   Sylvia that her mother used the very same bedroom (and died there) 
   and that the Count was not able to &quot;dominate&quot; her. The 
   Count barges into the bedroom and drags Blinka away, telling her, 
   &quot;I told you not to do that!&quot; Sylvia follows Blinka's 
   screams and discovers the Count whipping her. Sylvia then sees that 
   Blinka has fangs and runs to her bedroom. The Count frees Blinka 
   saying, &quot;Maybe I should tell her who you are!&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Sylvia wants to leave, but the Count tells her she must stay and to 
   call off her wedding, because the blood running through her veins 
   demands that she stay. The Count then relates a story about her 
   grandmother. Flashbacks show us how Malenka (Ekberg again), a 
   brilliant biochemist, was killed by the villagers, burned alive at 
   the stake for being a witch (she was actually working on a formula 
   for immortality). Ever since, every Countess in the castle was 
   cursed, which is why she can never get married.&nbsp; The Count 
   continues, telling Sylvia that her ancestors are actually alive, but 
   they are &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, the living dead. It turns out the 
   Count is actually her great-grandfather and he opens Sylvia's 
   mother's tomb, showing her that it is empty. Is what the Count 
   telling her true?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Sylvia writes Piero a letter, calling off their wedding, so Piero 
   travels to the castle with his best friend Max (C&eacute;sar Benet, 
   as &quot;Guy Roberts&quot;, this film's comedy relief and his only 
   film), where Vladis tells them that Sylvia left orders not to be 
   disturbed. Piero sees Sylvia through a window and calls to her, but 
   all she does is give him a faint smile, not saying anything. At the 
   inn, Bertha asks Piero to examine her because she hasn't been feeling 
   well lately and Max begins sneezing because he is allergic to garlic, 
   which is hanging all over the bar and inn. That night, Max wakes 
   Piero up when he sees a huge black bat flying by the bedroom window. 
   Bertha's sister, Freya (Rosanna Yanni; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CountDraculasLove">COUNT
    DRACULA'S GREAT LOVE</A></B> - 1972), comes in to Piero and Max's 
   bedroom and tells them that Bertha just died and they will have to 
   put a stake through her heart! Piero talks to the village physician, 
   Dr. Horbinger (Carlos Casaravilla; <B><A HREF="frankensteins_bloody_terror_1968.htm">FRANKENSTEIN'S
    BLOODY TERROR</A></B> - 1968), who shows him two puncture wounds on 
   Bertha's neck and has him come to his office for further proof that 
   there are vampires in the village. We then see Bertha rise from her 
   grave and head towards the castle, but is she really a vampire?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The Count hopes to turn Sylvia into a vampire, so he cuts his wrist, 
   bleeds into a goblet and hands it to Sylvia to drink. She refuses, 
   runs to her bedroom, locks the door and escapes through a secret 
   passageway (all castles have them!). She finds a bound Blinka and 
   frees her. Blinka tells her about a secret tunnel in the family crypt 
   that will lead her to freedom. Looking for the tunnel, Sylvia meets 
   Bertha, who tries to bite her, but Sylvia escapes through the tunnel 
   and runs to the inn, where she meets Piero and tells him about 
   Bertha. He doesn't believe her, telling Sylvia that he just attended 
   her funeral that morning. Eventually, Piero begins to believe in 
   vampires, as he, Max and Dr. Horbinger go to the graveyard and wait 
   for Bertha to rise from her grave, where they plan on staking her 
   through the heart. They see her rise and Max sneezes, getting her 
   attention. Bertha attacks Dr. Horbinger, so Piero and Max head to the 
   castle after learning Vladis has kidnapped Sylvia. Piero tries to 
   talk some sense into Sylvia, but she tells him to go away because she 
   is cursed. Piero argues with the Count and Vladis knocks him 
   out.&nbsp; Blinka tries to put the bite on Max, but every time she 
   tries, he laughs because his neck is ticklish(!). Piero is chained up 
   and we finally learn that this vampire happening is nothing but a 
   hoax. The Count wants Sylvia to be commited to an asylum for the 
   insane so he can inherit the castle and the fortunes that come with it!</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Apparently, Boris Karloff was hired to play the Count, but when he 
   demanded North American rights to the film (which I find very hard to 
   believe, because he was very ill at the time), they hired 
   Juli&aacute;n Ugarte instead. If Karloff were to star in this film, 
   he would have passed away during production, making this his last 
   film. To add insult to injury, the producers of this film pulled the 
   budget during week four of a seven week shoot, forcing de Ossorio to 
   rewrite the ending, which make no sense at all. To further add more 
   insult to injury, the American distributors tacked on an alternate 
   horror ending, showing the Count disintegrating into a skeleton and 
   that he really was a vampire, contradicting the rest of the film!</FONT></FONT><BR>

   anyone leave an astronaut abandoned on the Moon?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then switch to Alice (Florinda Bolkan; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#FlaviaTheHeretic74">FLAVIA
    THE HERETIC</A></B> - 1974), who has been having a recurring 
   nightmare about the abandoned astronaut. She tells a friend that she 
   thinks it has something to do with a movie, called &quot;Footprints 
   On The Moon&quot;, that she saw as a child but never saw the ending. 
   She thinks the nightmare is her brain filling in the blanks. Alice is 
   also shocked to learn that she has lost three days and tries to 
   remember what happened. Alice is a translator for the International 
   Congress and the last thing she remembers is sitting in her booth, 
   translating a speech that was being given. She also discovers a torn 
   piece of paper that has the word &quot;Garma&quot; printed on it. 
   Garma is a small island off the Italy coast that she believes she 
   never visited, but she will soon find out that isn't the case. Alice 
   finds a strange dress she has never seen before in her apartment, so 
   she packs it in her suitcase and heads off to Garma, where she hopes 
   to unravel the three missing days.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Once on the island, she goes to Hotel Garma, the only establishment 
   equipped to handle tourists. For some reason she can not quite 
   understand, she asks for a particular room overlooking the ocean. She 
   then takes a walking tour of Garma (the island is full of ancient and 
   beautiful buildings) and by the look on her face, everything feels 
   familiar to her. She meets a small girl named Paula (Nicoletta Elmi; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WhoSawHerDie">WHO
    SAW HER DIE?</A></B> - 1972) and when Alice tells her her name, 
   Paula says, &quot;That isn't true. Your name is Nicole!&quot;&nbsp; 
   Paula tells her Nicole was looking for a white house in the woods and 
   that she is much nicer than Nicole, who was a bitch to her. Alice 
   then meets Alfred Lowenthal (John Karlsen; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Church1989">THE
    CHURCH</A></B> - 1989), who tells her he saw her on the beach two 
   days ago. Alice then goes to the beach and quizzes Mrs. Heim (Lila 
   Kedrova; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightChild1975">THE NIGHT CHILD</A></B> 
   - 1975), the town gossip. She asks Mrs. Heim if she saw her at the 
   beach two days ago. Mrs. Heim replies that she broke her glasses. If 
   Alice was there, she couldn't have seen her if she tried. What has 
   Alice wiped from her mind? She also meets Henry (Peter McEnery; <B><A HREF="tales_that_witness_madness_1973.htm">TALES
    THAT WITNESS MADNESS</A></B> - 1973), a biologist who lives on the 
   island. He tells Alice he never met her before and it is quite 
   obvious that he has romance on his mind. Is Henry telling the truth 
   or is he holding back something? When Alice gets back to the hotel, 
   the concierge (Feridun &Ccedil;&ouml;lge&ccedil;en) tells her that 
   she had a long distance phone call, but he couldn't tell if it was a 
   man or a woman because the line was bad.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next day, after having the nightmare again (only this time, it 
   goes a little bit further than before), Alice meets Paula on the 
   beach and they build a sandcastle. Paula's dog, &quot;Fox&quot;, 
   refuses to come near Alice and Paula hands her a torn piece of paper 
   for the castle's flag. It looks exactly like the torn paper Alice 
   found earlier and she interrogates Paula into showing her where she 
   found it. It was at a campfire a short distance away, where Paula 
   tells her a woman holding a package was burning something. When Alice 
   asks if she was the one who was burning something, Paula says she 
   couldn't possibly be Nicole because she had long white hair (Alice 
   has short brown hair) and that she hated her. Alice starts to get mad 
   and begins shaking Paula. While walking through the forest looking 
   for the white house she was told about, she finds a red wig on the 
   ground. Is this a clue?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Alice goes to a boutique (after having drinks with Henry) to get the 
   wig cleaned, only to be told by the gay clerk (Luigi Guerra) that it 
   is her wig. When she puts it on, she becomes a different woman, both 
   in looks and attitude. The boutique owner (Caterina Boratto; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Phantom Death">PHANTOM
    OF DEATH</A></B> - 1987) tells Alice that the hat she ordered for 
   &quot;Helen&quot; is ready, but the pocketbook she ordered is not 
   ready because she didn't personalize it with the name 
   &quot;Nicole&quot; yet. Alice then goes to the island's old 
   cathedral, where Mrs. Heim hands Alice her &quot;lost&quot; wallet. 
   While listening to organ music, Alice has a flashback (flashforward?) 
   showing us that the abandoned astronaut has committed suicide by 
   taking his helmet off, forcing Professor Blackmann to find another

   but it is apparent that he is holding something from her. She finds 
   an important clue in his bathroom: An earring that quite possibly 
   belongs to her. She confronts Henry and when he truthfully answers 
   her questions, she stabs him to death with the silver scissors.&nbsp; 
   How is Professor Blackmann connected to Alice? Is she the new 
   &quot;guinea pig&quot; or is she psychotic and all of this is just in

    This isn't your typical giallo film, as there is no black-gloved 
   killer or murders every few minutes. Director/co-screenwriter Luigi 
   Bazzoni (<B><A HREF="fifth_cord_1971.htm">THE FIFTH CORD</A></B> -

   stories suddenly gel together. Some may find this film deadly slow, 
   as there is no nudity or graphic violence you expect from an Italian 
   giallo film but if story matters to you more than those two things, 
   you will be rewarded.&nbsp; A horribly dubbed Klaus Kinski is only in 
   this film for less than five minutes, so don't expect his usually

    Joanna (Christina Nagy) is a pretty young woman confined to a 
   wheelchair, put there when she was eleven years old, falling down the 
   stairs in her father's home while trying to escape from a serial 
   killer pedophile priest, who raped and killed dozens of pre-teen 
   girls before he disappeared off the face of the Earth. Joanna's 
   wealthy father has recently died, leaving her a wealthy woman. Joanna 
   has become an expert at fencing and archery (both will be used 
   towards the end of the film, but not in the way that I hoped), even 
   in her wheelchair, thanks to Craig (David Warbeck; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#FatalFrames1996">FATAL
    FRAMES</A></B> - 1996), a handsome young man at a rehabilitation 
   clinic that Joanna is funding, who makes her feel like a woman again, 
   even in her wheelchair. It's not long before Joanna and Craig fall in 
   love, even though Joanna's best friend, Ruth (Carroll Blumenberg) 
   doesn't approve. They get married rather quickly, even when Joanna's 
   physician, Dr. Sernich (Rossano Brazzi; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#PsychoutMurder1969">PSYCHOUT
    FOR MURDER</A></B> - 1969), tells Craig that the pedophile priest 
   raped Joanna before she tried to escape from him. He also tells Craig 
   that Joanna has a weak heart and any strenuous <A HREF="formula_for_a_murder_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/formula for a murder vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="221" HEIGHT="392" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>physical
    exertion, such as aggressive sex, could kill her. On their wedding 
   night, newlywed Craig has aggressive (bordering on rough) sex with 
   Joanne, causing her to scream, waking up a visiting Ruth, who gives 
   an evil look upstairs. Yes, Joanna and Craig are living in her late 
   father's house, the same location where she fell down the stairs as a 
   pre-teen, causing her to lose the use of her legs. Soon, Joanna 
   begins seeing someone dressed as a priest and carrying her favorite 
   childhood doll, which is covered in blood, walking down that same 
   staircase, calling her name over and over. She screams and both Ruth 
   and Craig come running to her, but there is no priest in sight. Is 
   she going mad or is someone trying to scare her to death, knowing 
   that she has a weak heart?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    If you guessed the latter, you would be correct, as director De 
   Martino reveals, rather quickly, that Craig and Ruth are working 
   together to kill Joanna, so Craig can inherit her millions and split 
   it with Ruth (De Martino doesn't want you to think that Craig will 
   inherit her millions by himself, since he is the only living member 
   of her family. Thinking logically? No, that just won't do!). What 
   Ruth doesn't count on is that Craig will actually fall in love with 
   Joanna, yet he still dresses as a priest, killing her real priests in 
   bloody, hard-to-watch killings (He doesn't want Joanna to write a 
   hefty check to the church) and haunting her by walking down the 
   stairs, holding the bloody doll (It's the film's most effective 
   scene, as the bloody doll talks [I couldn't understand what it was 
   saying, but it is still creepy], dripping blood as it comes 
   downstairs). He haunts Joanna as the priest on a ferry (She and Craig 
   seem to be the only passengers on it, so you would think Joanna would 
   make the connection!) and back at the house. Joanna also has a 
   recurring nightmare where she is in a park and her wheelchair can't 
   move because the wheels are locked. A faceless priest comes along and 
   pushes the wheelchair into a field, away from all the people, where 
   he tries to kill Joanna.&nbsp; She gets out of her wheelchair (she 
   can walk) and stabs the priest to death. Then she wakes up. If you 
   think Joanna is harboring a secret, you would be wrong, because she 
   can't walk.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Ruth is not satisfied with how their plan is going, so she tells 
   Craig that she will kill Joanna herself. Craig doesn't like that 
   change in plans, so he viciously slashed Ruth to death with a 
   straight razor (the film's bloodiest sequence). When Joanna 
   accidentally discovers Ruth's bloody corpse wrapped in plastic (a 
   killer's favorite way of disposing of a human murder victim!), it 
   leads to the frantic finale, where Craig Tries to kill Joanna, but 
   she gets the upper hand (at lest three times), as Craig refuses to 
   die (like Michael Myers!). Every time you think the film is going to 
   end and Craig is dead, he pops up and she has to kill him some more 
   (she tosses a fireplace poker like a spear, impaling Craig in the 
   leg; she stabs him in the stomach with a sword; and then tosses him 
   out a window, using her upper body strength to pull herself back into 
   the house, as her wheelchair and Craig are on the ground below, yet 
   he still returns, trying to kill her!). Dr. Sernich finally arrives 
   at the house and carries her to safety. The next time we see Joanna, 
   she is in a park and her wheelchair refuses to move. A priest comes 
   along and pushes her and her wheelchair to...THE END.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While I probably make this film sound better than it actually is, it 
   does have a manic performance by David Warbeck, especially in the 
   finale. Warbeck, who usually portrays stiff and stilted reserved 
   English gentlemen (thanks for the phrase, Steve!) in films like <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackCat1981">THE
    BLACK CAT</A></B> (1981), <B><A HREF="beyond_1981.htm">THE BEYOND</A></B> 
   (1981) and dozens of other films, is a revelation, as you will never 
   see him so animated and going full-tilt bozo as he does in this film. 
   It's almost enough to make me recommend this film. Almost. The sad 
   fact is that the story (screenplay by De Martino and Vincenzo Mannino 
   [as &quot;Frank Walker&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#HouseEdgePark1979">THE
    HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK</A></B> - 1979; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NewYorkRipper1982">THE
    NEW YORK RIPPER</A></B> - 1982]) is strictly old hat and full of 
   giallo clich&eacute;s, offering few surprises. It is bloody, though, 
   I'll give it that, but neither the bloody deaths nor Warbeck's manic 
   performance is enough to make me suggest that this film is a 
   must-see. It comes close, but eventually fails.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    characters, along with a healthy dose of black humor and unexpected 
   violence, that makes this one stand out from the pack. A medical 
   examiner, Sam (Tory Kittles), and a biologist, Mary (China Chow), are 
   sent into the Louisiana swamps to invesigate a mysterious death. What 
   they find is that some genetically enhanced (fucking giant!) Chinese 
   Snakehead fish have been accidentally set free in the area and are 
   chowing down on the local wildlife as well as the human population. 
   They soon become trapped on a group of docked houseboats populated by 
   some of the craziest (and funniest) locals to hit the screen in quite 
   some time. I really enjoyed the nudist couple (Richard Edson and 
   Noelle Evans) who grow hydroponic marijuana on their boat. There's 
   also Ricardo (Raul Trujillo), a silent local who has grudge against 
   the fish. There's also a houseboat where a quarreling couple (K.D. 
   Aubert and Matthew Rauch) on a date are visiting the girl's mother 
   (Donna Briscoe), who tries to set her up with Sam. After the 
   character exposition is out of the way, the rest of the film is 
   non-stop carnage as the monster fish bite the heads, stomachs and 
   other body parts off of the trapped cast. The real jolt comes from 
   the unexpected accidental death of Mary. It is a real surprise and I 
   applaud the filmmakers for killing a main character in such an 
   unheroic way. While the film does rely a little too much on CGI in 
   some scenes (especially when the fish jump in and out of the water), 
   there's enough comic lines (&quot;The house shot her!&quot; during 
   Mary's death and &quot;That's just so wrong!&quot; when everyone

   been the same since he saw his father killed (it is never explained 
   how he was killed or why). One day, Georgia goes to her video store 
   to do inventory, where we learn she has telekinetic abilities (She

    This is an incredibly cheap film, not helped by the fact that 
   director Joe D'Amato puts zero energy into the proceedings. 
   Everything simply just happens with no rhyme of reason. D'Amato's (as

    CAT IN THE BRAIN</A></B> - 1990) screenplay is full of every horror 
   film clich&eacute;, all done poorly and haphazardly, not even good 
   for an unintentional laugh. Poor Donald O'Brien looks embarrassed 
   appearing in this badly made flick, because we never believe, even 
   for a moment, that he's an ex-boxer, as his body frame is so thin, 
   you half expect him to fall through a crack in the floor. He also 
   shuffles around with huge metal staples in his forehead, looking like 
   some cheapjack version of Frankenstein, but only if Arnold Stang or 
   Wally Cox played the monster! You won't believe, even for a 
   millisecond, that someone so thin could lift a man twice his size up 
   in the air with one hand. I know when it comes to horror films you 
   should suspend all belief, but this film takes it much too far. I 
   would believe in God before I would believe Ric could do the things

   Everyone here also talks in stilted English, like it was their second 
   language or they were taking diction lessons from William Shatner 
   (&quot;I want...you...dead!&quot;), making what comes out of their 
   mouths hard to swallow. It's no surprise that many people in the cast 
   never acted again, because, said simply, they stink. While the film 
   is very bloody, with a lot of gory kills, the makeup effects look so 
   phony, you'll wince from embarrassment (The coroner's head squeeze 
   being the major offender). The film is so low-rent and cheap looking, 
   with flat photography (by D'Amato, as &quot;Frederico Slonisko&quot;),
    dime store effects (by Danilo Del Monte; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#FatalFrames1996">FATAL

   [who can't even play with a ball by himself without looking awkward!] 
   and the two security guards), you'll be wondering who the film was 
   made for. It certainly wasn't made for horror film or even bad film 
   lovers, so what's left? Oh, yes, the braindead. They'll love this 
   film because no brain cells will be depleted when watching this. For

   - 1993) was convicted of killing 29 young boys and burying them in 
   his crawlspace underneath his house. This film focuses on the last 
   few months of his freedom (before being executed by lethal injection, 
   his last words being, &quot;Kiss My Ass!&quot;), when the neighbors 
   and friends notice a peculiar smell coming from his basement. He 
   blames it on a leaking sewer pipe and lays down lime to offset the 
   odor. His wife and kids leave him after she finds homoerotic 
   magazines in his garage. He still picks up boys (posing as a cop) and 
   rapes them (never shown on screen) then buries them in his crawlspace 
   until there is no room left. His undoing comes when the police start 
   noticing that the boys that work for his construction company turn up 
   missing and stake out his house. The film skips most other aspects of 
   his life (being a clown at kids' parties is mainly glossed over as is 
   his penchant for painting clowns on canvas), although a flashback 
   paints that his whole problem with boys stems from an abusive father 
   (played by Adam Baldwin). Holton is good in the title role but most 
   of the sleazy things you expect from a film like this are never shown 
   or explored. It plays like a cable TV movie with some swearing and a 
   little female nudity. Director Clive Saunders seems to have wanted it 
   that way, but if you are going to do a film about one of the most 
   famous serial killers in U.S. history, a little blood and guts 
   wouldn't hurt. There are plenty of maggots and other bugs on display 
   here, representing all the decaying bodies buried in the crawlspace 
   which are sadly not shown except in bodybags at the finale.

   or drugs (it is never made clear) with supplier Mitchell (Reggie 
   Bannister; <B><A HREF="phantasm_1979.htm">PHANTASM</A></B> - 1979, 
   who has nothing more than an extended cameo). They are also being 
   staked-out by the police outside, who decide to make the arrests, but 
   the homeless zombies attack them and only two cops make it into the 
   warehouse (Mitchell is hit by the police van, smashing him into 
   bloody pieces). The two cops want everyone to put their differences 
   aside and work together to get out of the warehouse, but Hispanic 
   gang leader Caesar (Noel Gugliemi, listed in the credits simply as 
   &quot;Noel G&quot;) will hear none of it and eventually becomes head 
   douchebag in charge, killing one Black gang member by shooting him in 
   the head (after the gang member dares him to pull the trigger!) and 
   using everyone else as bait. What he doesn't know is one of the gang 
   members is a snitch and that's why the police are there to begin 
   with. The zombies begins to rip apart the cast one-by-one until only 
   a few are left (Caesar suffers the bloodiest death and it is very 
   well done), using a box of hand grenades to kill the rest of the 
   zombies. They make it outside, only to discover more meteors hitting 
   the skyscrapers of the city. Is there no hope left for humanity?&nbsp;
    While there is some bloody gore that sometimes surpasses the film's 
   R-rating, there is also some dodgy CGI, especially in the explosions 
   (it is easy to differentiate real flames from CGI ones). 
   Director/co-writer/co-producer Duane Stinnett (his only feature 
   directorial effort at the time of this review) offers nothing new to 
   the zombie genre and the screenplay, which he co-wrote with Krissann 
   Shipley (who stars as Cassie, the female member of the Hispanic 
   gang), makes some of the characters seem retarded, especially Latasha 
   (Dayanah Jamine), the sister of one of the Black gang members, that 
   you just want to strangle them. Sure, the film is stupid, badly acted 
   and cheap as hell, but it is worth at least one viewing if you can't 
   find anything better to watch. Also starring Howard Alonzo (listed

   Charles. John, who is an expert on the &quot;psychic sciences&quot;, 
   is deeply troubled and doesn't want to live any more, going as far as 
   to put a pistol to his head. Before he can pull the trigger, Margaret 
   grabs the gun and tries to console him, but fails (&quot;Why did you 
   stop me? I'm just a living corpse!&quot;). It turns out that Margaret 
   is having an affair with Charles, but she wants to stop. Charles 
   tells her that John will die very soon, as all he is doing is giving 
   him a shot of a stimulant every day, which makes him feel better, but 
   he is actually getting worse. John is paid a visit by Canon of the 
   church Father Owens (Umberto Raho, as &quot;Raoul H. Newman&quot;; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#WomenCellBlock71973">WOMEN

   bottle. John warns him that there is curare in that bottle and if 
   that poison were to touch his skin, he will be worse off the he is 
   (John even implies that curare put him in a wheelchair). That night, 
   Charles gives John his injection and he convulses. Is it possible 
   that he was poisoning John with curare so he could have Margaret all 
   to himself?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Margaret and Charles hear the bell John uses to summon Catherine and 
   they rush to him, only to find John dead. Charles says that he has 
   been dead for at least an hour. So who rang the bell? After John's 
   funeral, the crazy stuff begins to happen. Margaret is being driven 
   crazy by a howling dog, so Charles shoots and kills it. Then John's 
   wheelchair falls down the stairs, seemingly on its own and Margaret 
   hears and sees John calling her name (a really creepy scene). At the 
   reading of John's will, he leaves the house to Margaret, but only if 
   she will keep Catherine on the payroll to her dying days. He also 
   leaves the contents of his lockbox to Margaret and all his books and 
   research on the psychic sciences to a local university. Charles and 
   Margaret go nuts looking for the key to the lockbox, but Catherine 
   tells them that John kept the key in his coat...the one he was buried 
   in! Since there is supposedly over &#163;150,000 in cash and jewels 
   in the lockbox, Charles and Margaret do what any upstanding citizen 
   would do: open John's tomb and become graverobbers. They open his 
   coffin and find John's body a decayed mess, looking far more 
   decomposed than a body that was dead for a few days, but they do find 
   the key. While Margaret keeps Catherine busy, not letting her know 
   what the did to get the key, Charles opens the lockbox, telling 
   Margaret that when he opened it, there was nothing inside and they 
   will have to search the house for the valuables.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That night, Margaret sees a pale and sickly John carrying a bouquet 
   of dead flowers slowly approaching her bed (this scene will certainly 
   give you the creeps!). She empties a pistol (the same one John tried 
   to take his life with) into John's approaching body and then faints, 
   waking up with Catherine and Charles standing over her, but John's 
   body is nowhere to be found. Charles and Margaret see blood dripping 
   from the ceiling and Charles heads upstairs to investigate, finding 
   John hanging by his neck in the attic, but he can get no closer as 
   the attic door slams shut in front of him, locked. Father Owens then 
   pays a visit to the house, telling Margaret that she missed John's 
   memorial service at church and the town is gossiping about Charles 
   being at the house for such a long time after John's death. Charles 
   and Margaret begin to argue and grow further and further apart, so 
   Charles recommends that she go place flowers on John's grave and to 
   make sure that people in town see her doing it. She does just that, 
   but she hears John's music box playing both at the grave and inside 
   the house (Catherine tells her she hears nothing). Margaret goes to 
   John's favorite room where she sees his chess pieces move by 
   themselves and one of his books is open to a page on astral 
   projection. Margaret then hears John's voice telling her that all she 
   &quot;longed for&quot; is under his coffin.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Margaret, without Charles, goes to John's tomb and struggles to tip 
   over John's coffin. When she finally does, she discovers a gold 
   jewelry box under his casket, which she picks up, cutting her hand in 
   the process.&nbsp; When she opens the jewelry box, it is empty. 
   Catherine sees what Margaret is doing and pins the blame on Charles. 
   Margaret runs to Charles and he tells her he is leaving her because 
   all the wealth is not worth all the emotional pain he is going 
   through. When he picks up his suitcase, the missing money and jewels 
   fall from it to the floor, but he swears he doesn't know how it got 
   there. In a scene that has to be seen to be believed, Margaret picks 
   up a straight razor and slashes away at Charles until the screen 
   (including the camera lens) is full of blood. She drags his bloody 
   dead body to John's tomb, douses it with lamp oil and sets it aflame. 
   Thinking that her life is over, Margaret returns to her bedroom and 
   and spikes her nightly drink with curare, While she is sitting on a 
   bedroom chair waiting for the inevitable to happen, she sees the 
   bookcase open, revealing a secret passageway. John steps out of it 
   and is very much alive and healthy, telling Margaret that the curare 
   she just took was a phony, but when she cut her hand on the jewelry 
   box, it was dosed with just enough curare to to turn her into what he 
   once was: a paraplegic living a lifetime to think about all the bad 
   she has done with her life. It turns out Catherine was helping John 
   with his dastardly plan and her payment is a few bullets in her back. 
   But then, John accidentally doses himself with curare, pleading with 
   Margaret to give him the antidote, which is on a table beside her. 
   All Margaret can do is laugh, as she is unable to move. There is no 
   happy ending for anyone, as the film ends with Margaret laughing away 
   at the absurdity of it all!</FONT></FONT><BR>

   release by adding red-tinted solarized shots and ear-splitting stereo 
   sound effects (the rest of the film is in mono) in hopes of 
   modernizing this creaky little film. It doesn't work. It does work as 
   a piece of obscure cinema, but not as a watchable film. Maybe it was 
   obscure for a reason. Also starring Elsie Baker, Barbara Chase,

   in its' favor: The scene of the rolling boulders attacking an RV 
   Camper in the desert. I remember seeing this film on TV in the late 
   70's and was impressed by this scene. I'm still impressed by this 
   scene today, but the rest of the film is a bunch of paranormal crap 
   told in flashback to a parapsychologist (Rita Crafts) by grandmother 
   Ann Nelson (the hanging lady in <B><A HREF="airplane_1980.htm">AIRPLANE</A></B>

   (Caroline Howe), who goes crazy after talking to a mummy; and the 
   grandson (Matt Boston), who hears voices and is not acting like 
   himself. It's like watching three separate films stitched together 
   with a rather flimsy framing device: the boy being possessed by the 
   spirit of a mummy (due to astral projection). Director James T.

   (2011) -</B> This Nothern Ireland-lensed horror comedy (filmed partly 
   in the same area as the revived Hammer Films' <B><A HREF="wake_wood_2011.htm">WAKE
    WOOD</A></B> - 2011) has a really ridiculous premise, but the goofy 
   overall tone of the talented cast will win you over very quickly 
   (and, for once, their accents don't need subtitles to understand what 
   they are saying). The film opens with what looks like a meteor 
   hitting the waters just off the coast of Erin Island (a town known 
   more for their drinking than their fishing), when the crew of a 
   fishing trawler notice it and send out an SOS to the Coast Guard. 
   Everyone on the trawler is then disposed of by a huge creature with 
   tentacles. This just happens to be the first day of policewoman (here 
   called 'Gardas&quot;) Lisa Nolan (Ruth Bradley), who is on a two-week 
   temporary assignment on Erin Island to replace another Garda who is 
   on holiday. She is picked up from the ferry by fellow Garda Ciaran 
   O'Shea (Richard Coyle), who is nursing the mother of bad hangovers 
   and doesn't want a stranger as a temporary partner. Their first case 
   as an investigating team is the beaching and deaths of a group of <A HREF="grabbers_2011.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/grabbers dvd9 front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="214" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Pilot
    whales. Island coroner Dr. Adam Smith (Russell Tovey), who takes one 
   look at Lisa and is instantly smitten, tells them that this 
   phenomenon is known to have happened before, but scientists have no 
   explanation as to why it happens. Eternally drunk fisherman Paddy (a 
   hilarious Lalor Roddy) catches a baby tentacled creature in one of 
   his lobster traps and puts it in his bathtub (after it squirts 
   something in the face of another fisherman), while other people are 
   being pulled off the beach into the ocean by large tentacles. A 
   married couple relaxing in a house near the beach (the husband is 
   watching <B><A HREF="night_of_the_living_dead_1968.htm">NIGHT OF THE 
   LIVING DEAD</A></B> [1968] on his TV) get a knock on their front door 
   and when the husband opens it, he notices one of his friends (who he 
   thinks is drunk) is moving weirdly. He is actually being used as a 
   marionette by a giant creature as bait (or a worm as it were, pulling 
   a reversal on fisherman) and when the husband goes outside to 
   investigate, a tentacle pulls him up straight in the air, his wife 
   screaming in terror. She tries to hide in the house, but a tentacle 
   comes down the chimney and pulls her through the fireplace. When 
   Paddy is attacked by the small creature he found (it tries to wrap 
   itself around his face, a tribute to <B><A HREF="alien_1979c.htm">ALIEN</A></B> 
   [1979] and there are all types of references to other horror and 
   science fiction films in this movie), but he manages to pull it off 
   him without being harmed. He brings the baby creature to Alan's lab 
   for an autopsy (Paddy thinks it is dead and calls it a 
   &quot;grabber&quot;, a reference to <B><A HREF="tremors_and_its_dtv_sequels_1989-2020.htm">TREMORS</A></B> 
   [1989]), but Alan discovers that the small creature is pregnant (he 
   pulls out a disgusting round egg from its body) and tells Ciaran, 
   Lisa and Paddy that all the creature needs to survive is water 
   (shades of <B><A HREF="gremlins_1984.htm">GREMLINS</A></B> [1984]) 
   and blood, so he sets fire to it and Lisa accidentally sets off the 
   sprinkler system (Alan sarcastically says, &quot;You are Irish, 
   aren't you?&quot;), reviving the creature and it attaches itself to 
   Ciaran's face (it's funny and horrifying at the same time, as Ciaran 
   hits himself in the face with a shovel to get the creature off him), 
   but the creature suddenly lets go and falls to the floor. Adam comes 
   to the conclusion that the creatures are allergic to alcohol (Paddy 
   is drunk and Ciaran still has alcohol in his body from last night), 
   but they must find out how much alcohol in their system it will take 
   to kill the creatures (since all Paddy and Ciaran did was temporarily 
   incapacitate the small creature), so they use Lisa as a test subject 
   (she has never drank alcohol before) and get her drunk as a skunk 
   (it's a really funny scene) and then inject a vial of her 
   alcohol-infused blood into the small captive creature, killing it. 
   Adam reads her blood alcohol level as 0.20, so they will have do get 
   everyone on the island that drunk (there seems to be a lack of 
   children on the island, so that isn't a stumbling block in this 
   film), but not tell them the truth so there isn't a panic. They come 
   up with the bright idea to throw a party at the island's bar owned by 
   husband and wife Brian (David Pearse) and Una Mahar (Bronaugh 
   Gallagher; who is as funny here as she was in <B><A HREF="botched_2007.htm">BOTCHED</A></B> 
   - 2007), who are both aware of the situation, with a &quot;free 
   bar&quot;, so nearly everyone on the island shows up (hey, free booze 
   is free booze!) for the free drinks (mixed with Paddy's super-potent 
   homemade brew). It begins raining outside (not a good thing) as tiny 
   tentacled creatures approach the bar (it a hoot the way they move) 
   and Brian and Una try to get everyone to a 0.20 alcohol blood level 
   while a drunk Ciaran and Lisa are keeping an eye out in their patrol 
   car outside and begin to fall in love (it's a highly inappropriate 
   time and a drunk Lisa mentions that very same fact, but the drunken 
   heart wants what the drunken heart wants). They spot the tiny 
   creatures approaching the bar and start squishing them beneath their 
   feet, but they then notice one of the bar patrons has stepped outside 
   to take a leak and it is grabbed by the mother of all tentacled 
   creatures, spitting out the poor guy's head out till it rolls at 
   Ciaran and Lisa's feet. When the bar runs out of alcohol is when the 
   trouble really begins, but I won't spoil it for you, other than to 
   say that drunk people are rather useless in life-or-death situations 
   (Brian runs outside in the rain with a Super Soaker full of Paddy's 
   extremely flammable alcohol with a lit candle taped beneath the water 
   gun's spout, he being too drink to understand that as soon as he 
   walks outside, the candle will be extinguished by the rain) and Lisa 
   going into full-blown Sigourney Weaver mode (copying one of her 
   actions in <B><A HREF="aliens_1986.htm">ALIENS</A></B> - 1986). In 
   the immortal words of Brian the next morning. &quot;That was fun, 
   wasn't it?&quot; It sure was and a final coda at the end leaves the 
   film wide-open for a sequel, one I wouldn't mind watching.&nbsp; 
   Director Jon Wright (<B><A HREF="tormented_2009.htm">TORMENTED</A></B> 
   - 2009; <B><A HREF="robot_overlords_2014.htm">ROBOT OVERLORDS</A></B> 
   - 2014), working with a screenplay by first-time feature-length 
   writer Kevin Lehane, keeps the tone light and funny, even in the gore 
   scenes, such as when Ciaran and Lisa go to the house that was 
   attacked and a human head rolls off the roof and hits Ciaran squarely 
   on the nose. For once, the CGI is not a distraction and works very 
   well here, as the giant creature destroys a car and its tentacles 
   impale people through their torsos or just lift them up in the air. 
   The CGI-filled sequence of the baby creatures approaching the bar 
   will have you howling with delight, not because the CGI is bad, but 
   because it is so good you will not notice it is CGI at all (That is 
   what CGI should be: invisible). Screenwriter Lehane fills the film 
   with references to other films (there's a direct sequence related to <B><A HREF="predator_1987.htm">PREDATOR</A></B> 
   [1987] towards the end of the film) and some extremely funny 
   dialogue, such as when the bar runs out of alcohol and the drunk 
   group discusses that they may have to sacrifice one of their own in 
   order for the others to get away and Brian says, &quot;Let them eat 
   Father Potts (Miche&aacute;l O'Gruagain). That should keep them busy 
   for a while!&quot; (the look on the portly Father's face is 
   priceless) or a shit-faced Paddy telling another patron when he 
   discovers that they are out of booze, &quot;Relax, you'll give 
   yourself angina!&quot; Don't raise your expectations too high and 
   you'll have a lot of fun with this film. Also starring Pascal Scott,

    this. A vampire returns to life in the 1940's and attacks a necking 
   couple (no pun intended) parked in a graveyard. He kills the boy and 
   savagely rapes the girl. The girl becomes pregnant and gives birth to 
   a gray-skinned baby. The baby doesn't like milk so his mother feeds 
   him her blood to nourish him. Cut to the present. The boy is now a 
   man (William Smith) looking for the man responsible for ultimately 
   killing his mother (there's only so much blood a mother can give her 
   son). Smith finds the vampire (Michael Pataki) teaching classes at a 
   college! He enrolls in the class and the game of cat and mouse is on. 
   Two standout scenes: 1) The mother and son, standing in the shadows, 
   watching children playing baseball in the bright sunshine, knowing 
   that he will never be able to go out there and join them. 2) The 
   concluding scene of son and father fighting to the death. It is

   about-to-be-condemned Hagstone apartment building. He is trying to 
   get over the suicide of his wife Julie (Gizelle Erickson), who blew 
   her brains out with a pistol. Douglas deals with the many strange

   Murphy), Mr. Thompson (Jay Smiley), a man who knows the complete 
   history of the building, and Sam Witkowski (David S. Bennett), an 
   older gent who likes his pornography. Perhaps the strangest 
   inhabitant is Karna (Nadine Cross), a young woman who is living illeg<A HREF="hagstone_demon_2011.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/hagstone demon poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="174" HEIGHT="246" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ally
    with her hairless cat Victoria in Room 3, located in the basement 
   next to the laundry room (Douglas lets her live there because the 
   building is going to be torn down in two months). After driving out 
   of town to visit his brother-in-law Carl Becker (Sasha Andreev), a 
   priest who still remains friends with Douglas because he knows 
   something about Julie's past, Douglas returns to the Hagstone 
   building and becomes obsessed with Karna and the strange visitors she 
   receives at night. He follows her one night and watches as she gives 
   some guy dressed in a trenchcoat and fedora a plastic bag where <I>something</I> 
   is moving inside it (Unless I missed something, we are never told 
   what it is, although I think it is her cat) and when he goes to Room 
   3 to fix her toilet, she strips naked and offers to have sex with 
   Douglas. He turns her down, because he still can't get over the death 
   of his wife. Murders begin to happen at the Hagstone, including 
   finding the naked corpse of Sam on his couch (Mrs. Bennett says, 
   &quot;I always knew he was a masturbator!&quot; and Douglas finds a 
   &quot;Tijuana Bible&quot; among Sam's porn collection which will 
   prove important later on), Mrs. Bennett is found dead on the stairs 
   with six quarts of her blood dripping down the staircase and a truck 
   stop prostitute (Tiffany Moy), who Douglas paid a visit to, is found 
   murdered. Police Detective Willis (Michael Glen) believes Douglas is 
   involved in the murders and even threatens to exhume Julie's body, 
   which upsets Douglas greatly. Long story short, Karna is a succubus 
   and Julie killed herself because she was a Satanist (so was Douglas) 
   who was supposed to get pregnant by Douglas in a cult ritual, but the 
   pregnancy never happened, which made her commit suicide. Since Julie 
   died under those circumstances, it leaves her wide-open to also 
   become a succubus, so Douglas, Carl and Hagstone resident Barbara 
   (Cyndi Kurtz) must stop Karna, who digs up Julie's corpse in a 
   graveyard (she also murders Detective Willis at the graveyard) and 
   brings the body to a secret room at the Hagstone, ready to turn Julie 
   into a succubus. I won't spoil what happens next, only to say that 
   Mr. Thompson isn't who he says he is (it's quite the suprise, 
   especially when Douglas and Carl pull at his legs to get him off 
   Barbara) and getting to the secret room is one freakish 
   experience.&nbsp; Second-time feature film director Jon Springer (a 
   cinematographer by trade who directed a religious-themed feature film 
   and a bunch of horror-themed shorts before making this), who co-wrote 
   the screenplay with Harrison Matthews, is definitely a believer in 
   &quot;slow and steady wins the race&quot;, as the film moves at a 
   snail's pace, but reveals the underlying layers as it progresses. 
   Mark Borchardt is not your typical leading man, nor is he a very good 
   actor, but he is effective here for reasons I don't really 
   understand. He has long, greasy hair and wears huge eyeglasses with 
   coke-bottle lenses, but he fits the character he portrays perfectly. 
   The color film stock is used judiciously, only appearing in about 
   three sequences, but its use is effective (usually flashbacks are 
   shown in black &amp; white, not the other way around). This is by no 
   means a good film, but it is an interesting one, which is good enough 
   for me. Shot in 2007 and, besides a few festival showings in 2009, 
   not released on home video until 2011 (It carries a 2011 copyright 
   during the end credits). Filmed in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Also

   (2013) -</B> I quit watching the IFC Channel on TV a few years ago 
   when they changed their policy and started showing commercials every 
   10 minutes (Even though the channel still shows films 
   &quot;uncut&quot;, a movie that runs 95 minutes is now shown in an 
   unreasonable 135-minute time slot. You do the math.). I find it 
   ironic that the &quot;I&quot; in IFC stands for 
   &quot;Independent&quot;, since all their movies and TV shows are now 
   advertiser-driven. That's the antithesis of Independent (On a side 
   note, I predicted way back then that the Sundance Channel would go 
   the way of IFC and, sure enough, it did. Two commercial-free TV 
   stations now show more commercials than most major networks. These 
   are channels I pay a premium for from my cable provider and once were 
   stables of my TV-watching habits, yet there is no way to take these 
   two stations off my line-up. Hell, I remember when AMC was 
   commercial-free. This is what happens when major corporations like 
   Cablevision, Time Warner and Disney buy networks and enforce their 
   &quot;make more money&quot; rule.). Even though I haven't watched 
   anything on IFC for years, I do have to give them props for their IFC 
   Midnight DVD label, because they have released some very good (some 
   bad and some excellent, too) independent horror films (including one 
   of my favorites from the past decade, <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#AlmostHuman2013">ALMOST
    HUMAN</A></B> [2013]), so IFC is not completely off my radar (to see 
   a collection of films IFC Midnight has released, click <A HREF="ifc_midnight_posters.htm">HERE</A>).
    I honestly believe that IFC Midnight is the go-to label for 
   modern-day independent horror <A HREF="haunt_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/haunt 2012 dvd8 front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="262" HEIGHT="375" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>films,
    giving both first-time directors and established ones that are 
   dipping their toes in the low-budget pool an outlet to let their 
   films actually be seen outside of film festivals (Most IFC Midnight 
   pick-ups are given a simultaneous limited theatrical/VOD release 
   before being released on DVD. So far, most of their releases are not 
   on Blu-Ray, which is no big deal to me.). But I digress. Let's get to 
   the movie at hand. This is an old-fashioned haunted house film, that 
   plays with little gore, but plenty of jump scares. It's not really 
   that special, but it is done with some flair and displays a family 
   dynamic unusual for a horror film (thanks to first-time screenwriter 
   Andrew Barrer). The film begins with a drunk and pill-popping 
   Franklin Morello (Carl Hadra), as he is crying while looking at 
   Polaroids of his family. He is in a special room in his house, where 
   he hand-cranks some electronic box with decades-old tubes (the kind 
   that use to power early amplifiers and TVs) to contact the dead, 
   where he talks to his deceased children, apologizing for not being 
   able to protect them. A ghostly demonic creature (Kasia Kowalezyk) 
   then appears and attacks Franklin (his eyes turn completely black), 
   before he falls down a flight of stairs and dies. Franklin's wife, 
   Janet (Jackie Weaver; <B><A HREF="animal_kingdom_2010.htm">ANIMAL KINGDOM</A></B> 
   - 2010), the last surviving member of the Morello family, then 
   narrates the opening of the film, telling us that she, her husband 
   and children moved into that house, using part of the house to 
   practice pediatric medicine. Then, their three children began dying 
   in mysterious ways and their medical practice began drying-up (Janet 
   says, &quot;What good is a pediatrician who can't keep her own babies 
   alive?&quot;), the townspeople referring to it as &quot;The Morello 
   Curse&quot;. Janet moved out of the house and a new family (who are 
   aware of the house's history) move in. They are the Anders family: 
   mother Emily (Ione Skye; <B><A HREF="stranded_1987.htm">STRANDED</A></B> 
   - 1987), father Alan (Brian Wimmer; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Maddening">THE
    MADDENING</A></B> - 1995), teenage daughter Sara (Danielle 
   Churchran), pre-teen daughter Anita (Ella Harris) and 18 year-old son 
   Evan (Harrison Gilbertson; <B><A HREF="need_for_speed_2014.htm">NEED 
   FOR SPEED</A></B> - 2014), who is basically an Athiest and doesn't 
   believe in the afterlife. Janet pays the Ashers a visit under the 
   pretense of picking up a portrait of her dead son Matthew (Sebastian 
   Barr), who died at the same age of Evan, but it is obvious that she 
   has other reasons for checking out the new family occupying her old 
   house. That night, Evan hears what sounds like a violent argument in 
   the woods and he goes to investigate, meeting a crying pretty girl 
   named Sam (Liana Liberato; <B><A HREF="trespass_2011.htm">TRESPASS</A></B> 
   - 2011), who tells Evan to mind his own business. That same night, 
   while Evan is watching <B><A HREF="night_of_the_living_dead_1968.htm">NIGHT
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> (1968) on TV, the power goes out and he 
   has to go down to the basement to get to the fuse box (his parents 
   are hardly ever home for some unexplained reason). It's obvious to 
   the viewing audience that something supernatural is going on (such as 
   Anita walking around in a trance as she enters her bedroom) and when 
   Evan goes to bed, he is joined by Sam and he lets her stay because he 
   believes she is being abused at her home (she is). Sam has a 
   nightmare involving Janet and a crying baby and, when she wakes up, 
   it is morning and Anita (who now acts normal) is standing by the bed 
   wondering who she is. Evan has the coolest parents, who have no 
   problem with Sam spending the night with Evan (he is old enough to 
   make his own decisions), but mother Emily just gives Evan one piece 
   of advice: &quot;Be careful.&quot; (It turns out Sam is being used as 
   a punching bag by her always-drunk father when Emily notices the 
   bruises on her wrists and arms.). Sam stole the magic box to contact 
   the dead and when she and Evan use it in a shed next to a cemetery, 
   Matthew Morello leaves them an ominous message from beyond the grave 
   (Evan returns the box back to the special room in his house). As 
   expected, Evan and Sam become lovers, while Evan notices Anita 
   talking to herself in her bedroom (he totally misses the sudden 
   appearance of a ghostly girl, one of the Morello daughters, who makes 
   a short appearance in the bedroom doorway as Evan turns his back). 
   Even though the entire Archer family are well-aware thet the house 
   they moved in is supposedly haunted, they are not prepared for Anita 
   announcing over dinner that a girl ghost occupies her bedroom, but 
   she will do no harm to her as long as she keeps the ghost girl 
   &quot;happy&quot;. Evan and Sam go into the special room and use the 
   box again, this time Matthew Morello telling them &quot;Don't you 
   move!&quot;, but they don't listen and beat a hasty retreat outside 
   the room. Sam makes it out of the house, but Evan becomes possessed 
   by the demon creature and when Sam returns looking for him, Evan 
   tries to strangle her with his bare hands, but Sam manages to grab a 
   lamp and knock him out. Evan goes to Sam's house to apologize, but 
   her drunken father answers the door and says, &quot;Sam is not home 
   right now. Leave a message at the beep!&quot; and slams the door in 
   Evan's face. While Evan is walking away, Sam catches up with him a 
   few minutes later and both decide to go to Janet to see if she can 
   shed any light on their situation. Janet just yells not to use that 
   damn &quot;box&quot; again (There was just something off about the 
   whole conversation, which set off alarms in my head). Evan and Sam 
   burn the box, along with the Polaroids of the Morello family, but all 
   that does is make everything worse, as the demon creature invades the 
   house and flashbacks reveal the truth about everything. Like Janet 
   tells us in the finale, &quot;Some houses are more dead than 
   others.&quot;, as the camera pans down below the floorboards to 
   reveal the deadly secret. Director Mac Carter, whose first film was 
   the enjoyable DTV documentary <B><A HREF="secret_origin_the_story_of_dc_comics_2010.htm">SECRET
    ORIGIN: THE STORY OF DC COMICS</A></B> (2010) and was Second Unit 
   Director on the Vin Diesel film <B><A HREF="last_witch_hunter_2015.htm">THE
    LAST WITCH HUNTER</A></B> (2015), keeps us on our toes by 
   switching-up the old clich&eacute;s of haunted house horror films 
   with something completely different. I was quite surprised when I had 
   what I thought was a specific aspect about one of the major 
   characters (I won't spoil it for you, but the character says, 
   &quot;That's the spirit!&quot;), only to discover that I was 
   completely wrong. That doesn't happen very often and I was delighted 
   to be surprised I was wrong. While not particularly scary for a 
   haunted house film (but it does have its fair share of jump scares 
   and some goosebump-inducing scenes, especially when the box is used), 
   it does have a refreshing change of pace in depicting a family unit, 
   the parents believing everything their children tell them and 
   actually trusting them (even though Ione Skye and Brian Wimmer have 
   basically nothing but extended cameo roles). This is a perfectly fine 
   way to spend 85 minutes and it was great to have the DVD jam-packed 
   with extras (like DVDs were in the old days), including the extremely 
   creepy 8mm short film &quot;Morello Home Movies&quot;, which gives 
   that family a little more character development and ends on a truly 
   eerie final shot. The extras are as long (if not longer) than the 
   actual film and, for once, they are not filler or 
   &quot;making-ofs&quot;, but actual extras made specifically for the 
   DVD. You can do a whole lot worse than watching this not 
   by-the-numbers haunted house flick. Also starring Brooke Kelly, 
   Maggie Scott, Jan Broberg, Aline Andrade and Kelly Noonan. An <A HREF="http://www.ifcmidnight.com">IFC

    HAUNTING OF HELENA</A><A NAME="HauntingHelena2012"></A> (2012) -</B> 
   This is an involving Italian supernatural film that gets better and 
   better every time I watch it. The film concerns recently divorced 
   mother Sophia (Harriet MacMasters-Green; writer/star of <B><A HREF="parking_lot_2011.htm">PARKING
    LOT</A></B> - 2011) and her young daughter Helena (Sabrina Jolie 
   Perez) moving in to an apartment building, their apartment being the 
   scene of a brutal murder many years earlier. Helena is losing her 
   baby teeth, so her mother tells her to put her teeth under her pillow 
   and the Tooth Fairy will give her money for it. Before it happens, 
   Sophia gets into a major car accident with her daughter. A truck 
   sideswipes her, forcing the car to go over a bridge in the river 
   below (Sophie sees a ghostly girl child sitting in the backseat as 
   the car fills with water. A truly spine-tingling scene). No major 
   harm has come to Sophie or Helena, but Helena is never the same after 
   that, she is downright frightening. She makes her mother go back to 
   the destroyed car to fetch her tooth, which she lost in the accident. 
   Mom gets it and Helena places it under her pillow. Sophie sneaks into 
   Helena's bedroom to put money under her pillow, but Helena wakes up, 
   telling her that the Tooth Fairy already paid her a visit and gave 
   her money, a rare old Italian coin.&nbsp; Sophie doesn't know what to make<A HREF="haunting_of_helena_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/haunting of helena poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="223" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   of it, especially when she goes to Helena's school, told to come 
   there by the principal. She tells Sophie that her daughter is paying 
   other students for their baby teeth, showing Spohie the teeth that 
   she had already collected and the money she paid them, more old rare 
   coins. Back at their apartment, Helena tells Mom that the Tooth Fairy 
   lives in a portable wardrobe closet (which Sophie brought up from the 
   building's basement, placing it in Helena's bedroom) and visits her 
   every night. She has no teeth, so the Tooth Fairy gave her money to 
   collect more teeth. Mom is not so sure of the matter, thinking Helena 
   is telling a fib, but where is she getting the rare coins? Their 
   neighbor, the elderly Mr. Ferri (the late <A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_3.htm#PaoloPaoloni">Paolo
    Paoloni</A>; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#VoicesFromBeyond91">VOICES
    FROM BEYOND</A></B> - 1991) tells Sophie that her apartment was the 
   site of a brutal murder in 1940, an Army Captain pulling out all of 
   his wife's teeth for smiling at another man! He then locked her in 
   the wardrobe closet, where she died several days later. This bit of 
   information leads to more trouble, especially when the Tooth Fairy 
   makes an appearance in front of Sophie and Helena, opening her mouth 
   and showing she has no teeth (a truly frightening sequence). Sophie 
   throws all of the teeth Helena collected to the Tooth Fairy, but it 
   doesn't end there. We are then taken to 18 months later. Helena is 
   now confined to an insane asylum and she hasn't spoken since the 
   incident. Her father, Robert (Jarreth J. Merz; <B><A HREF="passion_of_the_christ_2004.htm">THE
    PASSION OF THE CHRIST</A></B> - 2004), comes to the asylum and tells 
   Sophie that he is taking his daughter to Cancun, where he works. 
   Robert doesn't live for much longer, because he is killed in the 
   wardrobe closet (in a scene that must be seen to be believed). It 
   turns out that this insane asylum also housed the husband that killed 
   his wife in 1940, but he has long been dead. So why does Sophie 
   always see him looking out a window in a part of the asylum that has 
   long been closed (the only other one who sees him is a male patient)? 
   Sophie begins an investigation into what happened to the husband and 
   learns that he hid all of his wife's teeth, so Sophie gets the idea 
   that if she finds the teeth and gives them to the Tooth Fairy, her 
   daughter will be cured. Long story short, she finds the teeth and 
   gives them back to the Tooth Fairy, only to learn that the Fairy is 
   actually an Ogre who killed a bunch of children in 1940 (the town 
   blamed the deaths on wolves!) and once the husband discovered who his 
   wife really was, he pulled out her teeth and locked her in the 
   wardrobe closet. Since the Tooth Fairy has all her own teeth back, 
   she is now an Ogre once again, leading to Helena's death and Sophie 
   being committed to the insane asylum. In a scene that will chill you 
   to your core, Sophie sits outside on a bench at the asylum, cursed to 
   see the visage of her dead daughter, looking out at her from the same 
   window the dead husband did, for the rest of her life. This is a very 
   well made film, directed and written by the relatively new team of 
   Christian Bisceglia and Ascanio Malgarini (also this film's </FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">visual
    effects supervisor</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">,
    which are well done), with many very frightening and well-timed 
   scares. It also has many WTF?!? scenes, including a room raining down 
   teeth, Sophie lifting her covers in bed to discover she is covered in 
   flies and a locker in the asylum turning into something very deadly. 
   I saw this on streaming channel <A HREF="http://www.screambox.com">Screambox</A> 
   ($4.99 a month and well worth it) in a beautiful anamorphic

   seems to be the only cop who believes that there is a serial killer 
   out there who is nicknamed &quot;The Engineer&quot;. It seems someone

   the Lament Configuration Box and opens it, his life turns into a 
   total nightmare. He begins seeing things that can't possibly be 
   there, like a pair of female Cenobite tatoos moving on a tattoo 
   artist's back. To make a long story short, Dr. Gregory turns out to 
   be none other than Pinhead (a.k.a. &quot;The Engineer&quot;), who 
   doesn't punish Joseph (not at first), but sends him on a quest that 
   will finally make Joseph see the light. Turns out that the fingers 
   found at the scene of the crimes are none other than Joseph's when he 
   was a child, so he is transported back to a time when he was a child 
   to unravel the mystery. What he discovers is not what he

   entertained until the &quot;What The Fuck?!?&quot; finale, where it 
   seems he and co-writer Paul Harris Boardman couldn't quite figure out 
   a proper ending for the film. That's a shame, because I was having a 
   good time with it before the abrupt finale that really doesn't 
   measure up to the rest of the film (It seems like Joseph is cursed to 
   relive the same day over-and-over for all eternity. Does that remind 
   you of anything?). Like I said before, the film would have worked 
   well enough without any of Clive Barker's characters (the Pinhead 
   character is in the film for five minutes, tops, and the other 
   Cenobites have even less time) and would have been a good cop

    Taking place two years in the future (in 1991), we see head

   Rossi Stuart; <A HREF="horror j - q.htm#KillBabyKill1966"><B>KILL, BABY...KILL!</B></A>

   a human being, where volunteer Maurizio (Gaetano Russo; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Trhauma1979">TRHAUMA</A></B> 
   - 1979) has been isolated in a cave for 78 days with no televisons, 
   clocks, radios or human interaction, just a phone to be used for 
   emergencies only. Maurizio is being watched closely by CCTV cameras 
   to study his demeanor and he seems to be holding up nicely, although 
   Dr. Johns and his crew, which includes assistant Erna (Barbara 
   Cupisti; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Stage Fright">STAGEFRIGHT</A></B> 
   - 1987), technician (and Erna's love interest) Paul (Pietro Genuardi; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#PaganiniHorror1988">PAGANINI
    HORROR</A></B> - 1989) and scientist Manfred (Lorenzo Majnoni), want 
   to get him out of the cave within the hour, Dr. Johns telling them as 
   soon as the news crews and reporters arrive, they will get him out 
   (Dr. Johns seems to be more interested in the publicity and money he 
   will get for further experiments). But things are about to go very, 
   very wrong, as Maurizio uses the phone for the first time telling 
   them to get him out of there immediately, there are human skulls full 
   of maggots, a huge burning cross in front of him and saying &quot;They
    are coming to get me!&quot; Then all the CCTV cameras go out and Dr. 
   Johns says that he and his crew must go down to the cave and rescue 
   Maurizio because it is apparent that his mind has snapped. Wanna bet?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As Dr. Johns and his three-person crew are about to descend into the 
   cave system, they are stopped by college students and amateur 
   archaeologists Laura (Andrea Damiano; her only film) and Theo (Mario 
   Luzzi), who tell Dr. Johns that they need to go with them because the 
   cave system is connected to a nearby church with an ancient and 
   deadly history. Dr. Johns lets them come because Laura has detailed 
   maps of the cave system which may help them find Maurizio. The now 
   six-member crew arrive at Maurizio's living space in the cave, but he 
   is not there. Suddenly, every electronic device starts exploding 
   (including all the devices Erna, Dr. Johns, Paul and Manfred brought 
   with them) and Laura gets separated from everyone else. The rest of 
   the crew tries to find Maurizio, but Theo decides to look for Laura 
   instead (he has the hots for her). Laura finds what she is looking 
   for, a sacrificial chamber that has a huge stone tablet on one of its 
   walls. Laura begins translating the tablet into her cassette recorder 
   and it tells us that, in the year 1291, seven Benedictine monks were 
   murdered for heresy by the Catholic Church, but before they died, 
   they promised to return in seven hundred years (Do the math!) and 
   kill seven people whom they believe are guilty of religious heresy, 
   thereby returning them to immortal life and a Hell on Earth. Laura 
   then has her head cleaved open with an ancient stone axe and is

   Theo is then caught in an ancient booby-trap, where an iron cage

    The number &quot;7&quot; becomes a major character unto itself in 
   this film, as there are seven people in the cave (including Maurizio) 
   and when Dr. Johns discovers Laura's dead body and listens to her 
   translation of the tablet, he still doesn't believe in such religious 
   mumbo-jumbo because he is a scientist and only believes in facts, not 
   the supernatural, but when Erna asks why they would be considered 
   religious heretics, it turns out Laura and Theo were Jehovah 
   Witnesses (they told Dr. Johns that fact before they descended the 
   cave), Dr. Johns is an Athiest, both Paul and Manfred are Jewish and 
   Erna is a lapsed Protestant, all of them considered 
   &quot;heritics&quot; by the Catholic Church in the Thirteenth 
   Century. Dr. Johns and his crew find Maurizio, who has his leg 
   hopelessly trapped under a boulder, so Dr. Johns sends Manfred and 
   Paul back to the first cave to retrieve the first aid kit. Manfred 
   and Paul become separated when a cave-in occurs and Manfred is then 
   killed. Dr. Johns starts believing in the supernatural when he finds 
   Manfred's dead body with seven ancient daggers impaled in his body, 
   forming the shape of a crucifix. As a matter of fact, Dr. Johns and 
   Erna become quite unglued, running around the cave system like 
   chickens with their heads cut off, when it is revealed the 
   cave-in&nbsp; has trapped them all inside with no way to escape. 
   Maurizio is killed when seven deadly spiders approach him and bite 
   him (The film's best scene, but still confusing, as Maurizio doesn't 
   even try to push the spiders away from him!). Paul is able to create 
   a workable short wave radio by combining two of their walkie talkies 
   together and contact the outside world, who tell them that they will 
   be freed shortly.&nbsp; The rescuers come and The three survivors 
   think they are saved, but Laura's recorder turns on and informs them 
   that the seven monks can transform into anything they want, be it 
   spiders or human beings and when they notice that there are seven 
   rescuers, they realize that their time is up. The rescuers transform 
   into the seven monks (the head monk portrayed by Paul Muller; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightmareCastle1965">NIGHTMARE
    CASTLE</A></B> - 1965; in a quick cameo) and each of them stab Dr. 
   Johns, Paul and Erna, killing them. But wait! It's not over yet, 
   folks! Just like in Umberto Lenzi's <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#City Walking Dead">CITY
    OF THE WALKING DEAD</A></B> (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="nightmare_city_1980.htm">NIGHTMARE
    CITY</A></B> - 1980), Erna wakes up in her trailer and walks out to 
   talk to Dr. Johns as he and everyone else are about to go into the 
   cave to get Maurizio. Suddenly the phone rings and Maurizio is on the 
   other end, telling Dr. Johns to get him out of there immediately, 
   there are human skulls full of maggots, a huge burning cross in front 
   of him and saying &quot;They are coming to get me!&quot; Erna notices 
   a cut on Dr. Johns cheek that he received in the cave when they first 
   tried to rescue Maurizio and then she knows she is about to live the 
   same night all over again, perhaps for all eternity. THE END.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   a bit of class here until he starts to go off the rails, then he 
   becomes balls-out crazy. This is the last horror film by Lenzi that I

   a realist and recognize that none of these films, this one included, 
   are anywhere near as good as Lenzi's earlier films from the '60s, 
   '70s &amp; 'early-'80s (thanks to audience disinterest and rapidly 
   decreasing budgets, which led to the death of the Italian genre film 
   in the early-to-mid-'90s), but this is still an enjoyable, 
   quickly-paced, atmospheric flick that delivers what it promises. What

   newly-edited form. It seems that when Kyle MacLachlan (who should sue 
   for defamation of character) blew away the alien at the press 
   conference, a dog picked up a piece of it and the alien uses the poor 
   mutt's body as an incubator. The dog hatches many alien eggs in an

   (Kate Hodge) joins forces with a good alien (Raphael Sbarge) to find 
   the newly-hatched aliens who take over the bodies of patrons of a 
   rave club opened at the abandoned warehouse. This is strictly 
   second-rate stuff which offers none of the suspense or humor of the 
   original, as the aliens just jump from one body to the next without a

    After a long day in their car, Arthur and his young wife stop at a 
   hotel in Greenwich, Germany, just off the highway, for some rest and 
   relaxation. The wife strips naked, takes a quick bath and goes to 
   bed, while Arthur takes a shower. Suddenly, invisible hands grip 
   around Arthur's throat and choke the life out of him. It seems the 
   town of Greenwich is having a spate of unsolved murders, all the 
   victims being strangled. The coroner (Anastasio &quot;Joe&quot; 
   Campoy; <B><A HREF="crimes_of_petiot_1973.htm">THE CRIMES OF PETIOT</A></B>

    WEREWOLF AND THE YETI</A></B> - 1975) that he believes the murders 
   are being committed by a vampire, but the Commissioner finds it hard 
   to swallow. The coroner shows him his father's diaries and one 
   passage says that in 1886, Greenwich went through a string of murders 
   similar to what is happening now. Further investigation reveals that 
   every 28 years, for 28 days, these murders happen and no one was ever 
   caught. And this is the year it is to happen again. The coroner 
   believes the Winninger Castle may hold the clues to solving these 
   murders, so the Commissioner gets a search warrant and heads to the 
   empty castle in the middle of the night (Why does he need a search 
   warrant if the castle is empty?). While he searches the castle with 
   some officers and the coroner, a policeman standing guard is 
   strangled in his car by the invisible hands. The rest of the search 
   party go into the castle's basement, where they see the tombs of 
   Baroness Winninger, who died in 1870, and Baron Winninger, who died 
   in 1886. They open the Baroness's tomb and find a skeleton, but when

   his job to solve the murders. Count Oblensky (Wohlfahrt again) comes 
   to town and drives to the family castle, only to find it locked-up. 
   He talks to the Inspector, who can find no one with the last name 
   Oblensky ever living in Greenwich, but the Count tells him that Baron 
   Winninger stipulated in his will that the castle will only be in his 
   name for all eternity and he shows the Inspector the will as proof. 
   We then see pretty young thing Regina (Adela Tauler) returning home 
   from work and then taking a shower in her apartment. She hears her 
   door buzzer, jumps out of the shower and answers it, only to be 
   strangled by the Baron, her topless body falling to the floor. The 
   Count makes himself at home in the castle and is paid a visit by the

   murders (He is doing research on his family tree). The Count begins 
   reading the Baron's diary and learns he had a &quot;sickness&quot; 
   for several weeks that no doctor could diagnose. He then hears the 
   Baron laugh and goes down to the basement to investigate.&nbsp; The 
   Baron suddenly appears and just as quickly disappears, the Count 
   thinking his eyes are playing tricks on him, but he tells the

    A barmaid named Marianne (Patricia Loran) and her lover have sex in

   through the back door, only to fall victim to the invisible hands. 
   The Baron then appears in the apartment and chokes the life out of 
   Marianne. Susan (Susan Carvasal), the Count's girlfriend, arrives at 
   the castle and has him give her a tour of the castle. They make love 
   and then play a game of Chess (!). The Baron appears to the Count

    The first thing you'll notice when watching this film is that every 
   female in the cast has a nude scene (Regina's bush is so huge, it 
   pokes out the top of her panties!). The second thing you'll notice is 
   the total lack of blood or gory violence, which is strange 
   considering the subject matter. Director/screenwriter Jos&eacute; 
   Luis Madrid (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SevenMurdersScotlan">SEVEN
    MURDERS FOR SCOTLAND YARD</A></B> - 1971), credited on this print as

   but not one of them is ever acted upon. That's too bad, because this 
   film is soaked with atmosphere, where dread is around every corner, 
   but the ridiculous English dubbing (<B>Adolf:</B> &quot;I don't drink 
   too much!&quot; <B>Inspector:</B> &quot;That's what every drunk 
   says.&quot;) takes you right out of the film. Add bloodless vampires, 
   who would rather strangle you than bite you on the neck, into the mix 
   and what you end up with is a film that is great to look at (thanks 
   to the frequent nudity and some effective hand-held camera work), but 
   doesn't make a lick of sense (A vampire film with no vampirism? No 
   thank you!). The Baron is so easy to kill, you'll wonder why no one

   film starts simple enough, but then veers off into territory quite 
   unexpected. We follow professional hitman Frank Zimosa (voiced by 
   Rayner Bourton) as he goes on his latest &quot;job&quot;. He has been 
   hired by Jorge Mistrandia (voiced expertly by Michael Howe in a 
   chilling British tone), a bigwig that works for a mysterious 
   organization. Mistrandia has given Frank a special pair of glasses to 
   wear on the hit so he can watch him kill two people in the hotel room 
   next to Frank's, but he has some unusual requests before he kills the 
   husband/wife team of serial killers. He doesn't want Frank to use a 
   gun to kill them, but rather some strange tools he has supplied him, 
   which look like an ancient knife and axe. He wants Frank to remove 
   their brains from their head with the supplied tools and then cut 
   open their stomachs and remove their insides. Frank thinks the 
   request is <A HREF="hotel_inferno_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/hotel inferno amazon poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="227" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>weird,
    but Mistrandia is paying him well, so why the fuck not do what he 
   says. Frank slowly enters the targets' room and kills the wife first, 
   splitting open her skull and then removing her brain, but he notices 
   that the brain is leaking some green slimy substance. He knows right 
   away that this is not normal and asks Mistrandia who these people are 
   and he tells Frank not to ask questions and do what he was paid for. 
   Frank then goes into the bathroom where the male member is in the 
   tub, saying he knew he would come to feed &quot;Her&quot;. She needs 
   to be fed and killing him will feed her. Frank has no idea what he is 
   talking about (either do we) and questions Mistrandia again, being 
   told he will know everything at a later date when he needs to know 
   and to finish the job as requested, make sure these two people suffer 
   as much as possible. Frank has had enough and removes the glasses and 
   smashes them, only to discover that the hotel he is in is owned by 
   Mistrandia's organization for reasons that will be made clear later 
   in the film (and it's a doozy!). Everyone in the hotel is on 
   Mistrandia's payroll and now Frank is the target. He must try and 
   find a way out of the hotel before he loses his life, but it will be 
   extremely tough, because everyone in the hotel is infected by a 
   plague caused by &quot;Her&quot;, who is also known as &quot;The 
   Plague Spreader&quot;, a being from another dimension that 
   Mistrandia's ancestors captured in 400 A.D.. She needs to be fed fear 
   and pain to survive and Mistrandia uses his employees to create pain 
   in other people, but there is a deadly side effect. The more his 
   people kill, the more they become infected with the Plague, a disease 
   which deforms their bodies until they become nothing but green jelly. 
   Yeah, I know, this sounds far-out, but just go along with it because 
   this film is more about the action and bloody deaths, as Frank 
   traverses the hotel floor-by-floor, trying to find his way out before 
   he is infected, too, as Mistrandia taunts him on the hotel's intercom 
   system. You see, for every person he kills, he feeds the Plague 
   Spreader and he begins to become infected.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While nothing but a series of action and horror set-pieces, this is 
   a well-edited experience, as Frank uses guns, knives and even a 
   chainsaw to battle his way out of the hotel. The film's shining 
   moment is when Frank discovers a shotgun and uses it on the horde of 
   infected people coming after him. It is a non-stop barrage of deaths 
   by shotgun, as heads explode, body parts fly off and other gruesome 
   sights and you can't tell when the real life action ends and the 
   makeup effects take over, as they are seemlessly edited together. 
   While most people will find this movie hard to swallow, I found it a 
   mind-blowing experience (pardon the pun), because Giulio De Santi 
   definitely has talent to spare, supplying the tight direction and 
   editing, as well as the gory effects. Also excellent is the techno 
   music score by Protector101 and Razzaw, fitting perfectly to the 
   action on screen. Hey, I know this isn't rocket science and that this 
   is a cheap film, but it has the same &quot;something&quot; that I 
   found so appealing about his previous film. The Plague Spreader 
   (portrayed by Christian Riva) is a sight to behold, as she breathes 
   fire is such a strange way, you won't be able to take your eyes off 
   the screen. It's hard to explain the visuals in this film because 
   mere words cannot do it justice, so if your taste runs towards the 
   unusual and weird, seek out this short film (77 minutes). Also 
   featuring Wilmar Zimosa, Santiago Ortaez, Monica Mu&ntilde;oz, 
   Riccardo Valentiniand Giulio De Santi as an armless henchman.

    This one opens with geology student Carla (Stefania Orsola Garello) 
   being plagued by waking visions that includes: a Buddhist monk (Hal 
   Yamanouchi; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Endgame">ENDGAME</A></B> 
   - 1983; here billed as &quot;Yamaouchi Haruhiko&quot;) whacking away 
   at the head of a statue of Buddha with an axe until it bleeds; a big 
   hairy spider crawling on a woman's face; a skeleton in a wheelchair 
   coming towards her; and a young boy with bloody hands raised in the 
   air; until she screams in fear. Carla is part of a group of geology 
   students spending two months in the mountains studying fossils with a 
   grant supplied by their university and group member Kevin (Joseph 
   Alan Johnson; Fulci's <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#SodomasGhost">SODOMA'S
    GHOST</A></B> - 1988) tells Carla not to worry about the visions 
   because,&nbsp; &quot;It's okay, the doctors gave you a rational 
   explanation. You've got psychic powers. You're a medium!&quot; (No 
   doctor on Earth would ever tell a patient that. Doing so would get 
   them banned from their profession!). Carla tells Kevin that she 
   doesn't want to be a medium, but Kevin says in two days their grant 
   ends so they will be back in civilization and her visions should end.

    On their way back to civilization, the group stops at a gas station, 
   where reporter Daria (Licia Colo) is interviewing locals about the 
   sorry state of the area. She tells group leader Massimo (Matteo 
   Gazzolo; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#BodyPuzzle1992">BODY PUZZLE</A></B> 
   - 1992) that most of the roads to the big city are blocked due to 
   landslides, but he convinces the group to push on because it will 
   only get worse the longer they wait. They drive for hours and can go 
   no further because the only road is impassable. Carla's young brother 
   Gianluca (Constantino Meloni), who for some unknown reason<A HREF="house_of_lost_souls_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/house of lost souls british dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="244" HEIGHT="357" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   is part of the group, says he saw a sign for a hotel about a mile 
   back, so they turn around and drive to it, only to find it is closed. 
   Suddenly, a light comes on and a strange silent man (Charles 
   Borromel; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#WhiteApache1987">WHITE APACHE</A></B> 
   - 1987), the hotel proprietor, appears at the front door. Kevin 
   pleads with the man to let them spend the night there, they are cold 
   and don't want to drive back to the nearest village, promising that 
   they won't be any trouble. The proprietor shakes his head in 
   agreement and gives them the keys to three rooms. Carla tells Kevin 
   that the proprietor scares her and she doesn't trust him, but Kevin 
   tells her not to look a gift horse in the mouth, handing her the keys 
   to Room 13 (!), which she will share with Gianluca.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Carla can't sleep and hears noises, so she gets up to investigate 
   and ends up in the hotel's basement, where an unplugged TV shows her 
   a man killing his wife with an axe and then going after his young 
   son. Just as the man is about to split the boy's head in two with the 
   axe, the TV screen explodes and Carla screams, waking up nearly 
   everyone, except for Gianluca and the proprietor. Kevin calms Carla 
   down by telling her everything is all right; she was just having a 
   nightmare. Group member Mary (Laurentina Guidotti; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Specters1987">SPECTERS</A></B> 
   - 1987) can't find her boyfriend Guido (Gianluigi Fogacci) and goes 
   looking for him, only to end up trapped inside a walk-in freezer with 
   two human corpses hanging on meat hooks. Gianluca, who has slept 
   through his sister's ordeal, wakes up to find blood dripping on him 
   from the ceiling and his bed is crawling with deadly tarantulas. He 
   screams and everyone runs to his room and find Gianluca not 
   breathing. Kevin revives him (and blames his condition on bad 
   nightmares! Is that his answer to everything?), when Guido notices 
   that Mary is missing. Guido finds her nearly frozen to death in the 
   freezer but he has a hard time believing Mary when she tells him 
   about the two frozen stiffs in the freezer, when none can be found. 
   Everyone finally notices that strange things are happening to them, 
   so they decide to find the proprietor and question him, but he's 
   nowhere to be found. Kevin and Massimo go looking for him and find 
   fresh blood in the cemetery (every hotel or house in films like this 
   have a cemetery!), along with a strange medallion with &quot;Mandalay 
   May 6, 1969&quot; written on one side. What could it possibly mean? 
   It turns out the proprietor was actually a serial killer accused of 
   beheading some of the hotel's guests back in May of 1969 with the 
   help of his young son. As the proprietor was about to go on trial for 
   the murders, he committed suicide and the decapitated heads of his 
   victims were never found. Will Kevin be able to find the severed 
   heads behind the hotel's walls using his trusty metal detector 
   (What??? Is he hoping to locate their fillings?) and end this 
   supernatural haunting before the entire group is beheaded? Do you 
   even care? I sure didn't!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Believe me when I say you won't give two shits to what happens to 
   any of them because this is one of the most lazily written late-'80s 
   haunted house thrillers to come down the pike in quite some time and 
   that's saying a lot. Since this is actually a TV movie written and 
   directed by the usually dependable Umberto Lenzi, I was expecting a 
   lot more than what I was delivered. Lenzi, like most Italian genre 
   directors, lost their mojo during the latter half of the '80s &amp; 
   early-'90s, Lenzi giving us the lousy <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Welcome Spring Brea">WELCOME
    TO SPRING BREAK</A></B> (1988), <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#HitcherInTheDark">HITCHER

    HOUSE OF WITCHCRAFT</A></B> (1989) and <B><A HREF="#BlackDemons1991">BLACK
    DEMONS</A></B> (1991) during this sad period in Italian genre 
   history. This is a film where people do the most idiotic things 
   possible at the most inopportune times, so you'll be wishing for 
   their demise long before it happens. The fact is, these characters 
   are insufferable and deserve their deadly fates, but since this is a 
   TV movie, the camera pulls away before the blood begins flowing, 
   leaving us to wonder the point of the film (The worst you will see 
   are a couple of bloodless severed heads rolling on the ground, 
   Guido's leg getting caught in a bear trap and Massimo being beheaded 
   by a falling windowpane, none of it very original or exciting). I'm a 
   big Umberto Lenzi fan, especially his films from the '70s, but I 
   would be lying to you if I said any of his late-'80s/early-'90s films 
   were any good. The fact is they aren't, but I believe the cause was 
   Italian genre cinema was dying a very quick death, thanks to viewer 
   disinterest, extremely low budgets and sloppy, clich&eacute;d 
   screenplays. I would love to get in a time machine and change this 
   time in Italian genre film history, because all we have now are these 
   films to remind us how bad it really was for our favorite directors 
   to find employment is such dark, dire times. It didn't just happen to 
   Lenzi, it also affected Lucio Fulci, Sergio Martini, Ruggero Deodato, 
   Lamberto Bava and many others.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    little horror/action film about a group of four gun-toting cons who 
   agree to pick up a strange electronically sealed package and sit on 
   it for 24 hours for a fee of over one million dollars. Curiosity gets 
   the better of them as they open the package and unleash one of the 
   strangest creatures to ever grace the screen. It looks like a giant 
   stitched-together penis and soon it has the four cons turning on each 
   other and anyone who comes into the apartment. This Item speaks 
   perfect English and knows all your fears, hopes and dreams and uses 
   them against you. Filled with scenes of jaw-dropping violence (some 
   of which is downright hilarious), gunfights, verbal sparring and 
   characters that have to be seen to be believed. Director/Screenwriter/Star
    Dan Clark is to be congratulated for turning such a low budget film 
   with such a weird premise into a treat for the eyes and the ears. 
   This is a close as you can get to watching an art film and still call 
   it horror. I like to think of it as Art House Exploitation. Mr. Clark 
   is a force to watch out for in the future. Also starring Dawn Marie 
   Velasquez, Dave Pressler, Dan Lake, Ron Fitzgerald and Judy Jean 
   Kwon. An Artisan Home Entertainment Release. <B>Unrated</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

    the downfall of once promising businessman Jack Magnus (Aaron 
   Gaffey), who begins to tweak a special brand of methamphetamine with 
   his old high school chum Mike (Kyle Yaskin) and becomes hopelessly 
   addicted to the stuff, even though it kills his friend on the first 
   try. He begins to have paranoid hallucinations that everyone is out 
   to get him (and is also haunted by the ghost of Mike), picks up the 
   titled tool and begins to run everyone through with it. Castro also 
   supplies the special makeup effects (he's better at this than 
   directing) and includes a truly cringe-inducing scene of Jack 
   cleaning out his infected, swollen arm with q-tips and peroxide. 
   There's also scenes of the jackhammer (with the longest extension 
   cord in movie history) entering body parts, including the mouth, 
   stomach, ass and other extremities, eyes being poked out, a lesbian 
   scene and all the actors take off their shirts at one point or 
   another, making some of the scenes look like a gay porn video. If 
   Castro was trying to tell us that taking drugs was bad, point 
   well-taken, even if it is heavy-handed. Otherwise this is just a 
   gore-soaked, badly-acted snoozefest with no redeeming value and an 
   ending which will probably lead to an unwanted sequel. If that 
   interests you, then go for it. I just found it dull and listless, 
   like some drug addict's libido. Also starring Evan Owen, Nadia

    always wonderful Jack Elam). The two are adversaries at first, but 
   after a big fistfight between them, they join forces to find the 
   killer. The town matriarch, Elizabeth Mescal (Ruth Roman of <B><A HREF="baby_1974.htm">THE
    BABY</A></B> - 1973), who recently lost her son Travis, is the only 
   clue to the killings. After the fatal stabbing of the town 
   barber/mortician, the sheriff and the detective figure out the case. 
   It seems Elizabeth's son Travis (Peter Athis) didn't die and is 
   slowly dying of syphilis, which he caught off the town's whores. She 
   keeps him locked in a cage upstairs in her house feeding him a strong 
   pain killer to keep him alive and manageable. Elizabeth is killing 
   the women (and men) in retribution for her son's condition. The film 
   ends with her severely-scarred son falling off a staircase trying to 
   stop his mother from killing the town's good girl Jenny (Diana 
   Ewing), Both mom and son die. Director Larry G. Spangler (<B><A HREF="soul_of_nigger_charley_1973.htm">THE
    SOUL OF NIGGER CHARLEY</A></B> - 1973) does a good job with the 
   suspense and even gives his son Jon Spangler a major role as Seth, a 
   kid who accuses the wrong person for killing one of the women, which 
   leads to the man's death by hanging. Gene Evans (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Devil Times Five">DEVIL

   sheriff's job, only to get caught in a gunfight with the sheriff and

   between the killings. Brentwood offered this film on DVD in it's <B><A HREF="blood_bath_2_dvd.htm">BLOOD

   a VHS tape as there are instances of tape rolling and fluttering. You 
   do get the choice of listening to it in Dolby Digital 5.0 though. 
   Horror Westerns are a rare breed, so I think this scarce film alone 
   is worth the DVD's price of $9.98. Also starring John Kellogg, Derek

   destroying the giant crocodile by throwing the spinning blades of an

    Sure enough, about a year later, a young couple go wind surfing, 
   only for the young lady to get plucked out of the water, a tasty meal 
   for the killer crocodile. We then find out why this crocodile is 
   going rogue. Just like the first film, toxic waste is to blame, 
   illegally dumped in the swampland of the crocodile's home by a 
   chemical company out to save a few bucks. Russel (Franco Fantasia; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EatenAlive1980">EATEN
    ALIVE!</A></B> - 1980) phones his friend Kevin, saying he has 
   something to tell him (but not over the phone, which defies all logic 
   and is a trope used in far too many Italian genre flicks), only he is 
   killed by three goons working for the chemical company when he 
   secretly inspects one of their waterfront warehouses and finds drums 
   of toxic waste.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Novice reporter Liza (Debra Karr) gets a tip about illegal dumping 
   in this unnamed Caribbean country (filmed in the Dominican Republic), 
   so she flies there to continue her investigation. Meanwhile, the 
   crocodile is cutting a bloody swatch through the swamp, chowing down 
   on a group of schoolchildren as they travel down river, while a nun 
   watches helplessly as her charges turn the water red. Liza goes to a 
   press conference, where an official announces that all <A HREF="killer_crocodile_2_1990.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/killer crocodile 2 poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>illegal
    dumping has stopped and all the barrels of toxic waste have been 
   recovered, saying that the swampland is clear, so a new resort can be 
   built on the land. Liza is sure he is lying, especially when she 
   finds drums of waste in a warehouse, so she calls her boss to give 
   him the details. Her boss doesn't trust her to get the full story 
   because she is a novice, so he tells her he is sending her former 
   flame, Kevin, to help her uncover the truth. Liza is not happy about 
   it, so she hires a boat before Kevin gets there and begins searching 
   for drums of waste in the swampland to prove the official is not 
   telling the truth. Unfortunately, she hires a boat belonging to one 
   of the chemical company's goons and he tries to rape her, only Liza 
   is having none of it, pulling out a switchblade and telling the 
   rapist that she is from New York (!) and knocking him off the boat, 
   where the crocodile bites off his head! A few moments earlier, the 
   crocodile kills the three goons who dumped the toxic waste earlier in 
   the film by bursting through a wall of their hut and dragging the 
   entire hut into the swamp water.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Kevin arrives in country, but when Liza doesn't contact him, he goes 
   looking for her in the swamp, finding her boat destroyed with the 
   crocodile's teeth prints on the wreckage. Kevin goes to the swamp 
   home of hunter Joe (returning actor Ennio Girolami, as &quot;Thomas 
   Moore&quot;; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Light Blast">LIGHT BLAST</A></B> 
   - 1985) and tells him that another giant crocodile is in the swamp. 
   Kevin is sure Liza is alive and he's right, as we see her walking 
   through the jungle looking for a way out to civilization. Kevin and 
   Joe go searching for her, but the croc knocks Joe out of the boat and 
   kills him, but before he dies, he makes Kevin promise to kill the 
   crocodile (&quot;Don't miss!&quot;). Kevin intends to keep that 
   promise and a short time later he finds Liza and they come up with a 
   plan to kill the giant crocodile. Will they be successful? I bet 
   Joe's dynamite will stop this giant lizard and it may bring up other 
   secrets to the surface that the swamp holds.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While the first film had its moments (although very few of them), 
   this sequel is nothing but a retread, so if you saw the first one 
   there's no need to watch this one. The full-sized crocodile, created 
   by director/co-writer Giannetto De Rossi (Dardano Sacchetti, as 
   &quot;David Parker Jr.&quot;; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Devil Fish">DEVIL
    FISH</A></B> - 1984, wrote the majority of the screenplay), is a 
   wonderful creation, but it is not used to its full potential here (it 
   is also obvious that this is a very low budget affair, no-budget 
   actually, since it was shot back-to-back with the original film, the 
   lion's share of the budget going to the first film). Riz Ortolani's (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#RingsOf Fear1978">RINGS
    OF FEAR</A></B> - 1978) music score, which sounds like warmed-over <B><A HREF="jaws_1975.htm">JAWS</A></B> 
   (1975), is also rehashed from the first film, causing a severe case 
   of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu in anyone who saw the first film. If you are 
   going to make a sequel, at least add something original to the mix, 
   so the viewer doesn't become bored, which I was in spades. It also 
   doesn't help that everyone in this film does stupid things, 
   especially Liza, who, after being rescued by Kevin, goes jumping in 
   the swamp water looking for her Geiger counter, telling Kevin she was 
   sure she dropped it there earlier! The characters are nothing but dry 
   white toast, not helped by the awful dubbing, but I can't blame the 
   dubbers because they were probably more bored than I was. While there 
   is a smattering of blood and gore, as well as some female nudity 
   (Watch the pathetic way Liza seduces Kevin. It will have you laughing 
   at the ridiculousness of it all.), none of it particularly stands 
   out. If you want to see a cool crocodile and some nice scenery, but 
   not much of anything else, by all means search this film out.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   unconscious. While Eliana and Franco leave on foot, Mario shoots the 
   getaway driver in the head so he won't talk to the police and then 
   steals another car by roughing up the car's driver. Mario picks up 
   Eliana and a seriously injured Franco, where Eliana says that Franco

    This is a very minor Italian crime actioner that suddenly turns into 
   a rape/revenge thriller. All the ingredients are here: A brutal 
   individual who believes sexually torturing a woman is nothing but 
   foreplay (He even watches Mara go to the bathroom); a wife who enjoys 
   putting down her husband, especially in the company of strangers, 
   even going as far as to flaunt her affairs in his face; the female 
   member of the gang, who has lesbian sex with Mara in front of her 
   husband, Mara smiling the entire time; the husband, who puts up with 
   his wife's verbal and sexual put-downs, but when things get to be too 
   much, he turns the tables on the gang; the leader, who is in a 
   drug-fueled haze, yet his word is gospel to the gang; and the cop, 
   who feels the pressure of his job, but proves to his superiors that 
   he is the man for the job. Yet, this film fails to register with its 
   intended audience for many reasons. It's indifferently acted, the 
   direction is bland, the music soundtrack is off-putting and the 
   English dubbing is horrendous. There's a scene in the film where one 
   of Mara's boyfriends comes to the front door and starts feeling her 
   up and kissing her naked breasts, while Guido and the gang listen to 
   the lover grunt and groan wildly. The grunts and groans push the 
   believability factor off the charts and is what is exactly wrong with 
   this film. Director/cinematographer/editor Vincenzo Rigo, who usually 
   directed sex comedies (this being his first film), fails to let his 
   actors make an impression, as they either overact or underact 
   shamelessly. The screenplay, by Renato Romano (an actor by trade, 
   appearing in <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#SecretDorianGray70">THE 
   SECRET OF DORIAN GRAY</A></B> [1970] and <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#IguanaTongueFire71">THE

    FROM WOMEN'S PRISON</A></B> - 1978), offers nothing new to the 
   genre, just old hat ideas we have seen in countless films just like 
   it. The film ends with a &quot;surprise&quot; reveal, where Eliana is 
   actually Guido's lover and this whole thing was a setup so Guido 
   could murder his wife and blame it on the gang (Eliana purposely shot 
   Franco so she could take him and the gang to this house), but 
   Commissioner Di Stefano catches Guido and Eliana together at the 
   airport as they are about to fly to Buenos Aires, foiling their plan. 
   Don't think too hard or you'll see the inconsistencies of their plan 
   (like why did Eliana have to look in the phone book for Guido's 
   address?). That is the main reason why this film sucks so hard, it 
   offers nothing new and is just deja vu all over again. Deja vu all 
   over again.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Two unknown men at the London airport are carrying the identical 
   black satchels and walk into the bathroom. One man shoves the other 
   into a stall, cuts his throat with a straight razor and steals his 
   satchel. Peggy Foster (Gillian Hills; <B><A HREF="demons_of_the_mind_1972.htm">DEMONS
    OF THE MIND</A></B> - 1972) thinks she sees her boyfriend Michael 
   driving down the street and follows him, only to lose him in traffic. 
   Michael is a war photographer who has been on assignment in Vietnam 
   for the past four months and Peggy finds it odd that Michael would 
   return to London without telling her. She asks her friend Jackie 
   Polianski (Silvia Solar; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Eyeball1975">EYEBALL</A></B> 
   - 1975),<A HREF="killer_wore_gloves_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/killer wore gloves dvd-r front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="214" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Michael's ex-lover, if she has heard from Michael, but bitchy Jackie 
   puts down Peggy and leaves (Why she would have Jackie for a friend is 
   beyond me). She then asks Michael's boss, Ronald James (Stelio 
   Candelli; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#TropicOfCancer1972">TROPIC 
   OF CANCER</A></B> - 1972), if Michael is back from Vietnam and after 
   relentlessly hitting on her with no luck, he tells her no, he should 
   still be in Vietnam. Is this connected in any way with what went down 
   at the airport? What do you think?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Peggy is then in her apartment taking a shower when her doorbell 
   rings. After throwing on a robe (Nudity alert!), she answers the door 
   and it is stranger John Kirk Lawford (Bruno Corazzari; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Psychic1977">THE
    PSYCHIC</A></B> - 1977), who arrives early to see the apartment 
   Peggy is renting upstairs. He tells Peggy he is sorry for arriving 
   early (he was supposed to be there at 10:00 am) and Peggy says no 
   problem, taking him to the apartment. It is Michael's apartment 
   upstairs and even though there is a staircase inside her apartment 
   that leads to the apartment, she takes him outside to her terrace, 
   where a spiral staircase also leads to the apartment. She tells Mr. 
   Lawford (He says to her, &quot;Call me John.&quot;) that the inside 
   door to the apartment is always kept locked and not to try and open 
   it. Once in the apartment, John asks about the red lightbulb on the 
   wall and Peggy says this is her boyfriend Michael's apartment and she 
   is only renting it out because she needs the money; the red 
   lightbulb, when it's on, meant that Michael was in the darkroom and 
   not to come in. When Peggy leaves, John begins rummaging through the 
   apartment, as if he is looking for something.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Peggy gets a mysterious phone call by someone saying he is Michael, 
   telling her to meet him immediately at an abandoned small airport 
   nearby. When Peggy gets there, she walks into a huge hangar full of 
   old plane parts and someone takes a shot at her. Peggy runs to her 
   car and drives away, only to discover a crowd of people and the 
   police outside her apartment building. The building's superintendent, 
   Anthony (Goyo Lebrero; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Apartment13thFl72">THE
    APARTMENT ON THE 13TH FLOOR</A></B> - 1972), tells Peggy that 
   someone jumped, or was pushed, from one of the top apartment 
   terraces, Peggy takes a look at the corpse and she is sure that it is 
   the new tenant, John. When she gets to her apartment, Police 
   Investigator Walton (Manuel Gas) tells Peggy that the stiff fell from 
   her terrace. She tells him about her new, dead tenant, but Anthony 
   interrupts, saying he saw no one enter the building at the time she 
   gave; he mans a desk at the building's only entrance and no stranger 
   passed by him, he is sure of it. Then another stranger (Angel del 
   Pozo; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DemonWitchChild1974">DEMON 
   WITCH CHILD</A></B> - 1974) enters Peggy's apartment, apologizing for 
   arriving late and telling Peggy his name is John Kirk Lawford 
   (&quot;Call me Kirk.&quot;). The Inspector demands to see some 
   identification, which he provides, proving Kirk to be who he says he 
   is. The Inspector tells Peggy they have a mystery on their hands. If 
   the first man wasn't John Lawford, then who was he? And how did he 
   get by Anthony at the desk? The Inspector begins to think Peggy is 
   lying to him, but when he questions Peggy's nosy neighbor, the 
   obviously gay Mr. Lewis (Carlos Otero; <B><A HREF="devils_kiss_1976.htm">DEVIL'S
    KISS</A></B> - 1976), who treats his beloved cat like a wife (!) and 
   plays the standup bass all night long (!!), he tells the Inspector 
   that he did see a stranger ring Peggy's doorbell at the time she 
   said, but, as far as the murder goes, he saw or heard nothing. With 
   Peggy now off the hook, we have to ask ourselves this: Who really was 
   the fake John and why did he want to be in Michael's apartment?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Instead of telling the real John Lawford to take a hike, Peggy lets 
   him live in the upstairs apartment, allowing him to use the entrance 
   inside her apartment (He is handsome, unlike the fake John Lawford). 
   When Peggy spills something on her blouse, she takes it off and 
   throws it into her bathroom hamper (which looks like a giant green 
   frog, hanging on the bathroom door), only to discover that there is a 
   black satchel in the hamper (like the one we saw in the beginning of 
   the film). She opens the satchel and discovers many large bundles of 
   cash inside. Peggy then goes to the nearest bank, rents a security 
   deposit box and places the satchel inside it (after taking some cash 
   for herself!), knowing that the contents of the satchel are nothing 
   but trouble and having it in her apartment is trouble she doesn't 
   need (smart woman). She doesn't realize that someone wearing black 
   leather gloves is willing to kill for possession of the satchel. Who 
   could it be? All we know about the killer is that he/she rides a 
   motorcycle and seems to love doing damage to people's throats, 
   whether by straight razor or improvising on the spot with whatever is 
   handy. Think you know who the killer is? It doesn't take much IQ 
   power to figure it out because I have given you enough clues in this review.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This Spain/Italy co-production is a very minor giallo film that is 
   spiced-up with full-frontal female nudity to keep you awake. I have 
   to say, however, that there are some scenes that made me laugh, 
   albeit unintentionally, such as when Peggy begins firing a pistol in 
   her apartment when she thinks the killer is there and mistakenly 
   shoots and kills Mr. Lewis' beloved cat! A few minutes later, we see 
   Mt. Lewis with a new (and cute) kitten, teaching it to enjoy his bass 
   playing. While Mr. Lewis is playing the bass, the killer sneaks up 
   behind him and strangles him with an extra bass string he had lying 
   around. There is also some funny dialogue between Anthony and his 
   overbearing, cigarette-smoking wife (Irene<A HREF="killer_wore_gloves_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/killer wore gloves spain poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="309" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>

    TRAIN MURDERS</A></B> (1974). To call the screenplay lazy is an 
   understatement, as the killings are infrequent, which is a sin for a 
   giallo film. Besides the ones I already mentioned, there's the murder 
   of Peggy's friend Shirley (Orchidea de Santis; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SevenMurdersScotlan">SEVEN
    MURDERS FOR SCOTLAND YARD</A></B> - 1971), who doffs her clothes and 
   then gets her throat cut by the killer. There's also the death of 
   Jackie, who is working with the killer to steal the satchel from 
   Peggy when she is waiting in a subway station. When Jackie fails to 
   steal the satchel, the killer pushes her into the path of an oncoming 
   subway train. Most of the graphic murders happen in the final twenty 
   minutes of the film, leaving the remaining 65 minutes for 
   &quot;character development&quot;. The identity of the killer is 
   fairly easy to determine (but I won't spoil it for you) and the

    COME</A><A NAME="KingdomCome2014"></A> (2014) -</B> As an Atheist, I 
   generally frown upon sin and redemption disguised as horror films, 
   but I must say that this one entertained me. Eight people, including 
   a young girl, wake up at an abandoned hospital (The movie was filmed 
   in a real abandoned mental hospital in the town of London, Ontario, 
   Canada) with no idea how they got there. I know what you are 
   thinking: They are all in Hell and have to pay for their sins in the 
   worst way, but you would be wrong. None of them seemingly know each 
   other, but there is evidence that they are all connected in some way, 
   even if it's a trivial matter. There also seems to be no means of 
   escape from the hospital. The angry Roger (JoJo Karume) sticks his 
   arm out of a boarded-up window a few stories up, but something with 
   sharp teeth bites him in the arm. Roger (who is the only black man 
   among them) has a major attitude problem and leaves the group to go 
   searching for a way out on his own. The other seven split up onto two 
   groups and go searching for the same thing. Every once in a while, a 
   member of the group has a flashback that gives us a little piece of 
   their background <A HREF="kingdom_come_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/kingdom come poster6 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="182" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>and
    none of these flashbacks paint a good picture of any of them. But in 
   their flashbacks is usually another member of the trapped group. 
   Turns out that Roger was a notorious rapist and all his female 
   victims (none of them have a stitch of clothing on) appear in the 
   basement and rip Roger's stomach open, throwing his innards into the 
   air. Victoria (Chelsey Marie) goes to take a pee and when she gets 
   out of the stall, a junkie hands her a needle and the next thing we 
   see is Victoria screaming and being pulled under the stalls (It's 
   apparent Victoria was a junkie). Nadir (Soroush Saeidi) gets a visit 
   from his dead daughter Meesha (Sima Sepehri), who he accidentally 
   killed by smacking her in the face and falling down a flight of 
   stairs just for the mere fact she was dating a black man and he is 
   forced to hang himself with electrical wire before discovering it was 
   all a hallucination (Or was it?). Sam (Ry Barrett) has a flashback 
   where he killed his wife in a drunk driving accident while they were 
   celebrating their anniversary. Roaming the halls is the debonairre 
   Daniel Levine (Jason Martorino) and his entourage of 
   &quot;Gatekeepers&quot;, winged demons from the bowels of Hell. He 
   takes particular interest in Sam and Jessica (Camille 
   Hollett-French), who seem to be the keys to this whole hospital 
   haunting. He kills some of the people in the abandoned hospital (some 
   of which we are never formally introduced to) according to their 
   crimes and the Gatekeepers drag the bodies away. But what could be 
   little girl Celia's (Ellie O'Brien) crime? What could a pre-teen girl 
   be so responsible for that she needs a demon to pass judgment on her? 
   Pedophile Charles (William Foley) finds Celia hiding in a dryer and 
   takes her hand and leads her away. Will his urges come over him 
   before Sam and Jessica can save her (they have grown quite fond of 
   her)? A child from Charles past, now a woman named Rachel (Katie 
   Uhlmann; who is part of the original eight), goes to kill Charles 
   because of sexual things he did to her in his past and Sam must fight 
   a war of words with Daniel to get her to stop from killing Charles. 
   Daniel wins (this time) and Rachel beats Charles to death with a pipe 
   and the Gatekeepers drag Rachel away (Human nature is a tough act to 
   break). &quot;I can smell you, my little meat sacks!&quot; is what 
   Daniel says as he chases Sam, Rachel and Celia through the hospital 
   corridors. Sam cuts off Daniel's hand when he grabs Rachel's hair but 
   seconds later, we see Daniel with two hands again. Sam is magically 
   dragged away by Daniel, but Jess seems to be in a room that Daniel 
   can't enter. Jess leaves the room to save Sam's life and she stabs 
   Daniel in the eye, but Daniel begins to psychically choke the life 
   out of Sam, while Jess begs him to stop. Daniel makes Jess aware that 
   Sam's drunk driving caused the death of her husband and herself. 
   &quot;It must just eat away at you like a motherfucker!&quot; is 
   Daniel's reply as he tries to get her to kill Sam. Jess instead says 
   to Sam, &quot;I forgive you!&quot;, which leaves Daniel powerless to 
   do anything. Turns out Celia is working on the side of God, trying to 
   find the good in people (she found it in Nadir) and, as the 
   instrument of God, Daniel is pulled through a wall by some demon 
   hands. Celia is also the ghostly apparition of Jess' aborted baby and 
   she forgives Jess for her indiscretions (Jess was just a teenager 
   when it happened), so Celia whispers, &quot;172. She's waiting.&quot; 
   to Sam, touches his cheek and suddenly Sam is at the automobile 
   accident (seems like it was more of a pile-up than a two-car 
   accident, as we see several people from the abandoned hospital, 
   including Nadir, at the scene). Sam is able to locate Jess at mile 
   marker 172 and the ambulance takes Jess away. Looks like she will 
   have a nice life (although still husbandless). As Sam is strapped to 
   the inside of the ambulance, Daniel appears and says, &quot;Better 
   buckle up Sammy Boy! It's going to be a bumpy ride!&quot; Sam may be 
   damned to Hell for his sins, but at least he did the right thing when 
   it counted most.&nbsp;&nbsp; Never preachy or overtly religious, this 
   supernatural film with some severe dollops of gore and nudity 
   (Roger's death is a doozy and we can now understand why he is so 
   confrontational in the beginning of the film. It has nothing to do 
   with his color.), director/editor/co-producer/co-screenwriter (with 
   Geoff Hart [Producer of <B><A HREF="unearthly_2013.htm">UNEARTHLY</A></B>

   - 2012) makes an eerie little film with lots of atmosphere thanks to 
   filming at an actual abandoned mental hospital. It may take the 
   viewer several viewings to see what Mr. Sager was aiming for here 
   (religious people may get the inference sooner than most other 
   people), but this is a good little horror film with religious 
   undertones. Being an Atheist, films like this don't bother me, 
   especially if they are as entertaining as this one. Give this 
   Canadian film a try and you may just find yourself creeped out by the 
   way it is filmed and the connections between most of the cast. I will 
   definitely watch more films by Greg Sager when they come out, 
   especially if they offer the mystery and forgiveness (to a point) a 
   film like this rarely shows. Good stuff to make you feel better about 
   your own life unless you are worse than the people shown on screen.

   - 1990; <B><A HREF="in_the_spiders_web_2007.htm">IN THE SPIDER'S WEB</A></B> 
   - 2007). Why do I love this film so much, you may ask? Well, because 
   real tarantulas (thousands of them) were used and all the actors had 
   to endure them crawling all over their bodies, even biting them at 
   times (William Shatner tells a good story on an extra on the DVD 
   about him being covered with tarantulas while wearing a silk shirt 
   and he could feel their claws as they crawled up his body!) and even 
   though Shatner claimed very few actual spiders were killed in the 
   film, from what I saw, it looked like an awful lot were snuffed out!. 
   The premise is simple: veterinarian Rack Hansen (Shatner), who is 
   taking care of his dead brother's wife Terry (Marcy Lafferty, who was 
   married to Shatner at the time) and niece Linda (Natasha Ryan), after 
   his brother is killed in the Vietnam War (Terry and Rack almost have 
   a romantic interlude until she calls him his brother's name!) is 
   called to the farm of Walter Coby (Woody Strode; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Scream 1981">SCREAM</A></B> 
   - 1981) and his wife Birch (Altovise Davis; <B><A HREF="welcome_to_arrow_beach_1973.htm">WELCOME
    TO ARROW BEACH</A></B> - 1973; and one-time wife to Sammy Davis Jr.) 
   because their prized heifer looks like it was bitten by snakes and 
   had died. Rack sends a sample of the heifer's blood to a local 
   University and scientist Dr. Diane Ashley (Tiffany Bolling; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BonniesKids">BONNIE'S
    KIDS</A></B> - 1972) and her Mercedes travel to Rack's town of Verde 
   Valley (where a Festival is to take place in a couple of weeks) and 
   accidentally meets Rack at the local gas<A HREF="kingdom_of_the_spiders_1977_dvd.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/kingdom of the spiders dvd9 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="228" HEIGHT="319" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   station and mistakens him for the gas jockey (the entire sequence is 
   funny because Shatner is very charming in this film and doesn't do 
   his typical word cadence, where he pauses between words). When Rack 
   and Diane meet properly, she tells him that the heifer was not bitten 
   by snakes at all, but hundreds of spiders, tarantulas to be specific. 
   They head for Walter's farm (the town's Mayor Connors [Roy Engel] is 
   more concerned about a quarantine being put into place, destroying 
   any chance of holding the Festival. Sound familiar?), where Walter 
   and Birch show them a giant spider mound. Diane is surprised that 
   different species of tarantulas are not fighting with each other (and 
   cannibalizing each other), but getting along like good neighbors. 
   Diane theorizes that because of the use of DDT (Remember that fiasco? 
   If not, Google it), the spiders have adapted to it, but their food 
   sources have been killed in the process. She then goes on to say that 
   because the spiders have lost their food sources, they have adapted 
   to new food sources, namely animals (there have been over 30 missing 
   animals reports in the last month alone). Rack, Diane and Coby decide 
   to burn down the mound when Coby's prized bull is killed by the 
   spiders, but when they set fire to the mound, the spiders have a back 
   door getaway. As Rack and Diane begin a romantic relationship (much 
   to Terry's dismay), the spiders attack Coby in his truck and he goes 
   over the side of the road, When Rack, Diane and Sheriff Smith (David 
   McLean) make it down to Coby's truck, they discover that Coby is 
   covered in a web cocoon. The Mayor makes the decision to use a 
   powerful insecticide (to Diane's objections) on the spiders when 20 
   to 30 more spider mounds are found scattered throughout the 
   countryside, so he hires The Baron (Whitey Hughes) to fly his plane 
   and spray the affected areas. Little does The Baron know is that the 
   plane is covered inside with tarantulas and before he can really 
   begin spraying the insecticide, he is attacked (and he yelps out the 
   girliest man-scream I have ever heard!) and crashes his plane into 
   the garage of the gas station, where it explodes into a ball of fire 
   (This portion of the film has a lot of realism, because you can see 
   that Shatner, Bolling, Hoke Howell, who plays the mechanic/gas 
   jockey, and other actors in the film, were actually there when the 
   plane crashes and explodes and no stunt people were involved. That 
   took a lot of guts for everyone involved.). Our heroes become trapped 
   in the Washburn Lodge, run by Emma Washburn (Lieux Dressler; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#TruckStopWomen">TRUCK
    STOP WOMEN</A></B> - 1974) and occupied by her only other two 
   guests, Vern &amp; Betty Johnson (Joe Ross, Adele Malis). They try to 
   cover up all the entrances that the spiders can come through (the air 
   conditioning vents, the fireplace and other entry points), but they 
   have a hard time keeping the hordes of tarantulas out. The Sheriff 
   decides to check out the town, only to find out that it has already 
   been overrun with spiders, as he spots people in web cocoons on the 
   side of the road and people running in terror with spiders all over 
   them (it is quite the event, but not the Festival they were 
   expecting!). The sheriff dies when a car veers out of control and 
   takes out the two front legs of the water tower and it falls directly 
   on the Sheriff's car (Birch is also killed when her home is overrun 
   with spiders and she nearly blows off her hand shooting a pistol at a 
   spider residing there and Terry dies while saving Linda). When the 
   spiders take out the lodge's electricity by shorting out the fuse box 
   in the basement, Rack goes downstairs to fix it. He does, but then a 
   ton of tarantulas break the window above him and jump all over his 
   body (it's quite the sight) as Rack barely makes it up the stairs and 
   gets medical attention from Diane. As the sun rises and the spiders 
   have seemed to stop their attack, Rack decides to remove a board on a 
   window and is horrified at what he sees: the entire town is one giant 
   spider cocoon. What can they do next? Well, there was supposed to be 
   a sequel made (according to Shatner's interview), but it never 
   happened.&nbsp; This is probably director John &quot;Bud&quot; 
   Cardos' (<B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Day Time Ended">THE DAY TIME ENDED</A></B>

   without being bloody (unless you have a fear of spiders; then you 
   will be shitting your pants!) and the storyline (screenplay by 
   Richard Robinson and Alan Caillou; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Losers 1970">THE
    LOSERS</A></B> - 1970) puts almost everyone in the cast with a 
   chance to be covered with spiders (even Cardos' son, Jon-Jon, who we 
   see in the town, is crawling on the pavement with spiders all over 
   his body). If you like horror films from the 70's that cross the 
   boundaries of good taste, you can't do much better than <B><A HREF="kingdom_of_the_spiders_1977_dvd.htm">KINGDOM

   Here's something you don't hear very often: An Italian horror film

    The film opens with a family driving on a dark road in the forest, 
   when the car runs over some sharp shards of glass in the middle of 
   the road. The car gets a flat tire, loses control and crashes into a 
   tree, killing the father. There is no cell phone service in the area, 
   so the mother and young son Andrea (Francesco Lopez) walk down the 
   road hoping to flag down a passing car. As a car approaches, the 
   mother tells Andrea to wait on the side of the road while she steps 
   into the road to stop the car. The car hits her, sending her broken 
   and shattered body to the side of the road. The unseen driver stops, 
   gets out of his car and walks towards the mother, who is begging for 
   help. While Andrea hides behind a tree, he sees the man bash his 
   mother in the head repeatedly with a rock, killing her. Andrea cries 
   out for his mother and the man chases him into the woods, but soon 
   gives up, putting the mother's body in the back of his car and 
   driving away.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film switches to young woman Aurora (Daniela Virgilio), who has 
   just broken up with boyfriend Rino (Daniele Grassetti), but he 
   doesn't understand why (A flashback shows us Rino fucking Aurora 
   doggy style while she draws a picture for him with a crayon!). Rino 
   is watching Aurora's house in his car across the street and when she 
   comes outside, he pulls up beside her and begs her to get inside the 
   car so they can talk. We then discover that Aurora and Rino did very 
   little talking, as Rino's car is parked by the woods and they just 
   finished making love, but she tells him she needs time to think about 
   their relationship. Before they can talk further, three drunk thugs, 
   Cesare (David Pietroni), Ginger (Geremia Longobardo) and Diego 
   (Cristiano Callegaro), pull Rino and Aurora out of the car. They rob 
   and knock-out Rino, taking his and Aurora's cell phones out of the 
   car. As they are about to gang rape Aurora, a car comes up the street 
   and Aurora jumps in front of it, pleading for help. The driver, 
   Antonio (Gennaro Diana), tells Aurora to get in the back seat of his 
   car while he deals with the thugs. Antonio's wife, Clara (Santa De 
   Santis), tells Aurora not to worry because her husband will handle 
   the situation. And handle it he does. When the thugs come at Antonio 
   with knives, he pulls out a pistol and tells the trio to get lost, 
   which they do, but not before threatening to get even with him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Antonio drives Aurora and Rino to his home, a gated mansion with a 
   very long driveway that is located in the middle of the woods. While 
   Clara tends to Rino's wounds upstairs, Antonio asks Aurora if she 
   wants to call the police, but she says no, she would just rather 
   forget the whole thing and wait in his house until Rino is better (he 
   took a nasty blow to his head). Aurora should have accepted Antonio's 
   offer, because she and Rino are about to experience a horrific night 
   they will never forget, that is, if they survive the night 
   (throughout the film, we see Andrea running in the woods, yelling out 
   for someone to help him).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Aurora asks Antonio if he and Clara live alone in this large house 
   and he says no, their son Giulio also lives here, but he is sleeping 
   upstairs in his bedroom (&quot;He's only seven and he goes to sleep 
   quite early&quot; explains Antonio). It is at this time that Antonio 
   begins to ask Aurora some very personal questions, like if there is 
   anyone she needs to call to tell them she's OK (she says no), but he 
   does it in such a way that it doesn't sound sinister. He also tells 
   her that she is pretty and they begin to kiss, when Giulio (Fabiano 
   Malantrucco) runs into the room, scaring the crap out of Aurora. It's 
   plain to see that Giulio is not a normal child, as he has a mouthful 
   of very sharp teeth that are coated in blood. Aurora finally begins 
   to realize that this is no normal household, especially when she 
   tells Antonio that she needs to check on Rino and he tells her to 
   stay put and drink her coffee, he will go see how Rino is doing. When 
   Antonio comes back into the room, he is filling a syringe with an 
   unknown liquid, telling Aurora to stay calm, continuing with, 
   &quot;I'm sorry. I was gonna let you go. But it's too late now. It's 
   impossible, Aurora. I do it for Giulio. I do it for our son.&quot; 
   What is so impossible and why is it too late? If you want to know, 
   you're going to have to watch the film. Believe me when I say you'll 
   thank me for not telling you more. But I will tell you this: Don't 
   forget about Andrea, because he plays an important part in the finale.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This is truly a house of horrors, the like which have never been 
   seen before in a film made in the New Millennium. But it isn't just 
   the house that is full of horrors, it's the freaking woods that 
   surround the house, as Aurora discovers when she escapes the house 
   and is knocked out cold when she enters an RV parked in the woods. 
   What she witnesses after waking up in the house will take a strong 
   constitution and if your gag reflex is set to low, expect to lose 
   your lunch. This film takes elements from <B><A HREF="last_house_on_the_left2.htm">THE

   original and, above all, shocking beyond belief. Directed and written 
   capably by Gabriele Albanesi, who ushered in a new wave of Italian 
   talent, Albanesi also directing <B><A HREF="ubaldo_terzani_horror_show_2010.htm">UBALDO

    horror genre talent. This film definitely has a '70s vibe to it, 
   especially when Aurora wakes up in the house after escaping and 
   seeing the carnage that awaits her. Antonio definitely has some 
   perverted &quot;family&quot; members, as we witness Antonio's other 
   two &quot;sons&quot;...<B>Warning! SPOILERS!!!</B>...chainsawing some 
   appendages off a still alive Rino and using those body parts as food 
   for Giulio, who survives by eating human flesh, in a scene that looks 
   like a cannibal's version of The Last Supper! <B>END OF SPOILERS!!!</B> 
   It may seem a little too pat when the trio of rapists run out of gas 
   next to Antonio's home, but you'll definitely enjoy what happens to 
   them when they try to invade the worst home possible and they get 
   what they deserve (One of them even turns hero and tries to rescue 
   Aurora, but he pays for that, too! I would advise not eating a hearty 
   meal before watching this because it may leave the wrong opening in 
   your body!). Yes, this is truly a gore film, as nothing is left to 
   your imagination. I wish I could tell you the totally surprising 
   final shot, but if I did, it will destroy the impact it will have on 
   your psyche. I'll just say this: Some rooms in the house are covered 
   in plastic for a reason. The final reveal is an image that won't 
   leave your mind for a long, long time, if ever, making this film 
   highly recommended to horror and gore film aficionados. A film like 
   this doesn't come along very often, so I suggest you search it out 
   (keep reading).</FONT></FONT><BR>

   (&quot;The Woods Outside&quot;), this film was released Unrated on 
   DVD in the United States by Lionsgate Entertainment's late, lamented 
   label Ghost House Underground in a beautiful anamorphic widescreen 
   print in its original Italian with English subtitles (my preferred 
   way of watching a film) or English dubbed. It is also available 
   streaming on Amazon Prime (free for Prime members), but only in the 
   English dubbed version. The dubbing here is quite unobtrusive and 
   follows the Italian language version very closely. On a side note, I 
   recorded the Italian language version from the Independent Film 
   Channel (IFC) long before they decided to air commercials every ten 
   minutes. They still call themselves IFC, which is a fucking joke. I 
   mean, how in the hell can you call yourself &quot;Independent&quot; 
   when you air commercials? That is the antithesis of independent, 
   isn't it? Yet they continually harp on the fact that their movies are 
   not edited in any way, but it takes a 135-minute time slot to air a 
   90-minute film! Needless to say, I haven't watched IFC for years. 
   Rant over. Also starring Enrico Silvestrin and Elisabetta Rocchetti

   (2003) -</B> Director David DeCoteau is paying way too much time 
   making movies that would please gay men. This is one of those films. 
   The men (actually teenagers) are rarely wearing shirts and constantly 
   sporting Speedos and the women characters are vapid and <A HREF="leeches_2003.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/leeches vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="177" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>generally
    there because they have to be if DeCoteau is to release this as a 
   mainstream film. A male college swimming team (enter your own gay 
   male fantasy here if you like) use steroids to enhance their 
   performance. Unfortunately, while swimming at the local pond, they 
   are attacked by leeches who begin to grow three feet in length and 
   begin killing the team and their girlfriends. The leeches (who are 
   actually rubber concoctions pulled by strings or hand puppets when 
   they attack) somehow also begin to get smarter as they grow, 
   something that is not revealed until the &quot;surprise&quot; ending. 
   A nerdy team member, who refuses to take steroids, tries to find a 
   way to kill the leeches and save what is left of the swimming team 
   and their chicks. This movie is nearly stupid in every department, 
   except for the cinematography of <A HREF="gary graver.htm">Gary Graver</A>,
    who gives the film a polish it so dearly needs. If you like 
   close-ups of the male body, so lovingly panned up and down that it 
   almost seems like softcore porn, then this is the film for you. If 
   you want a balls-to-the-wall horror film (insert joke here), skip 
   this and watch something else instead. Myself, personally, felt dirty 
   after viewing this. Mr. DeCoteau, whose first non-porn film was <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Dreamaniac">DREAMANIAC</A></B>

   film was not directed by Deodato, but it is obvious the person who 
   directed this flick (Vincenzo Petrarolo) worships Deodato. If you are 
   thinking to yourself, &quot;Hey, if it was good enough for Lucio 
   Fulci in <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CatInTheBrain">A CAT IN THE BRAIN</A></B>

   was fabulous in that film and Deodato cannot hold a candle to him, 
   even on his best days. But I digress, so let's get to the film at hand.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Two young bucks, Marco (director Petrarolo) and his American friend 
   Ryan (Marcus J. Cotterell), want to make a scary movie (Ryan is 
   always telling Marco that it's not a horror film, then what in the 
   hell is it?), so they ask Deodato for advice. He agrees to appear in 
   their film, but only for one day, telling them that he wants them to 
   make a film that is &quot;real&quot;.&nbsp; The movie is to be filmed 
   in Marco's grandmother's house in the country, miles away from 
   civilization. His grandmother told him to<A HREF="liliths_hell_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/lillith's hell poster small2a.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   never, never, never enter the house, not telling him why, so he 
   ignores her and he, Ryan and cameraman Alberto (Fererico Palmieri) go 
   into the house. Ryan says this house is not very scary and doesn't 
   seem right for their film (Wait, I thought this wasn't going to be a 
   horror film?), but Marco tells him to go down to the basement and see 
   for himself. Ryan finds a huge bathtub on the bottom floor (it looks 
   like a small indoor swimming pool) and falls in love with the place, 
   telling Marco it is perfect for their &quot;cannibal&quot; film 
   (remember, this is not a horror film!). For being such good friends, 
   Marco and Ryan have a very combative relationship, arguing over 
   everything, even the small stuff, like eating the food in grandma's 
   refrigerator. Then, the main actress of the film, Michelle (Manuela 
   Stanciu), arrives with her personal makeup assistant, Sara (Joelle 
   Rigollet), and she's a diva, asking where the cocaine is (!) and 
   refusing to talk English until she gets some (Ryan then goes off on a 
   rant about how <B>CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST</B> was the first 
   &quot;mockumentary&quot; and how much <B><A HREF="blair_witch_project_1999.htm">THE
    BLAIR WITCH PROJECT</A></B> [1999] owes it!). And wouldn't you know 
   it, there's no cell phone reception in the area (although grandma 
   made sure her house was protected by putting security cameras in 
   every room [including the bathroom!] and also having a safe 
   room/control room to watch the action).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Now I could go on-and-on telling you what is wrong with this film, 
   but let me tell you what is good about this film: (<I>crickets</I>). 
   Okay, with that out of the way, let me say this: I was never a fan of 
   found footage films (I can count the good ones on one hand and still 
   have four spare fingers), but even ardent fans of this genre will 
   find this a tough slog to get through. It's horrendously acted, 
   especially by Marcus J. Cotterell as Ryan, whose idea of acting is to 
   yell out all his lines of dialogue while flailing is hands in the 
   air, like some interpreter for the deaf having an epileptic fit. 
   Also, the film is 50% English/50% Italian and it is a headache to 
   listen to and watch. Anyone who knows me realizes that I prefer to 
   watch films in their original language with English subtitles, but 
   when Marco begins speaking in English and then switches to Italian 
   mid-sentence, it's more than this viewer can stand. Pick a language, 
   Marco, and stick with it!. It also doesn't help that the dialogue is 
   pathetic (Sample dialogue: <B>Marco:</B> &quot;How did it go?&quot; <B>Ryan:</B> 
   &quot;Go fuck yourself, that's how it went!&quot;). So, what's up 
   with the title of this film, you may ask?&nbsp; As far as I could 
   tell, these amateur filmmakers somehow awaken the spirit of Lilith, 
   Adam's first wife, and she plays havoc with their film (Possessing 
   Michelle's body), leading to nearly everyone's deaths. Don't ask me 
   why or how, because I really have no idea, but I'm glad they're dead. 
   These are the most insufferable people you will ever meet, as Ryan 
   and Marco play practical jokes on each other (none of them funny in 
   the least), argue endlessly or just act like no human beings I have 
   ever met. You don't just watch this film, you suffer because of it. 
   Very seldom do I run across a film without having at least one good 
   thing to say about it, but here's a film that bucks that trend, 
   having nothing positive happen during its 88-minute running time. 
   Director Vincenzo Petrarolo and screenwriter Davide Chiara (who also 
   plays a ghostly spirit) are to be congratulated for making a movie 
   without a single solitary nice thing to say about it, a rare thing 
   indeed, but nothing to be proud of. If you must see for yourself, if 
   only to see if what I say about it is true, Amazon Prime offers it 
   streaming for free if you are a Prime member ($1.99 if you are not). 
   Also featuring Danilo Maria Valli, Dani Samvis, Mattia Enrico Rinaldi 
   and Sebastiano Lo Monaco as Padre Renghe, a priest who comes to the 
   house to perform an exorcism and then kills all the women with his 
   crucifix.&nbsp; <B>Not Rated</B>, but not worth it. You'll end up 
   scraping it off the bottom of your shoes after watching it. As for 
   Deodato: It is apparent he didn't give this film a full day of his 
   time, as he is in it for less than three minutes, but it must have 
   seemed like an eternity in Hell for him.</FONT></FONT></P>

   A reporter is on the case. A killer is on the loose. Although this 
   case would be solved in 10 seconds in real life, the point of this 
   film is to showcase the talents of Erik Stern. He displays a dual 
   personality, which is truly fascinating. One character is Caleb, a 
   crippled, bald and ugly gardener whom his women customers pick on. 
   The other character is Lester, Caleb's handsome dead brother, who 
   considers himself an &quot;Adonis to all women&quot;. When a woman 
   puts down Caleb, Lester pays her a lethal visit. The script contains 
   many twists and turns along with a few shocks. Sympathetic characters

   another is amazing. He does it with a minimal of makeup. And his

   crafted a work of unbridled disturbing behavior here. Writing under 
   the pseudonym &quot;Whitey Styles&quot;, Albright tells the story of 
   Luther Watts (Edward Terry), a rather troubled individual who had his 
   teeth knocked out as a child while watching a circus geek bite the 
   head off a chicken. In 1990, Luther is released from a correctional 
   facility after spending 25 years there for murdering three people by 
   biting their necks and watching them bleed out. As soon as Luther is 
   released, he chows down on the neck (with his sharpened metal teeth!) 
   of an old lady (Gail Buxton) waiting at a bus stop and hides out at a 
   farm house owned by Hilary Lawson (Joan Roth). Luther takes Hilary 
   hostage (after a failed attempt of blowing her vagina off with a 
   shotgun!) and ties her to a bed. Hilary's daughter Beth (Stacy 
   Haiduk) discovers her mother tied to the bed but cannot free her in 
   time before Luther comes back after injuring Beth's boyfriend Rob 
   (Thomas Mills) and killing an intruding hunter (Martin Widener). 
   Luther can only communicate by cackling like a chicken or crowing 
   like a rooster, so reasoning with him is out of the question. Luther 
   holds Hilary, Beth and Rob hostage, but you know pretty soon this is 
   going to turn into a cat-and-mouse chase, where only the survival of 
   the fittest and quickest-thinking can survive. I won't spoil the rest 
   of the film for first-time viewers, but you'll be highly-rewarded, if 
   not grossed-out by the rest of the proceedings. The bloodletting is 
   highly realistic and the tension builds to a heart-pounding 
   conclusion. This is Carlton J. Albright's only directorial effort and 
   it's a damned shame that he hasn't made another film since. This is 
   truly gripping stuff that should be watched by anyone who likes to be 
   scared. In case you haven't noticed, I liked this film. The 
   performances of all involved are realistic to the situations and, 
   just like in real life, there are no complete happy endings. Pick

   house and starts breaking the fireplace bricks with a pickaxe, only 
   he didn't knock-out Paola as well as he thought, because she wakes up 
   and Joe threatens to bash her head in if she doesn't sit still and be 
   quiet. Of course, Paola doesn't listen and tries to escape, forcing 
   Joe to throw the pickaxe, which impales the front door. He then 
   punches Paola in the face, knocking her out cold again. Joe breaks 
   open all the bricks covering the loot, but he has to dig deeper in 
   the dirt to get to it. He wakes up Paola, makes her get him a cup of 
   coffee and forces her to dig deeper in the dirt with the pickaxe. 
   Paola uses her body to distract Joe, but he's having none of that, as 
   he strips Paola naked and rapes her (offscreen). We then see Joe and 
   a naked Paola in bed, Paola telling Joe that he's a good lover. She 
   then gets up out of bed and runs out of the house wearing nothing but 
   a worried look, but Joe catches her, brings her back to the house and 
   ties her to the bed, also gagging her.&nbsp; Joe continues to dig 
   deeper in the fireplace dirt, when he hears Liliana pull up in her 
   car. Joe also takes her prisoner and wants to know when Sergio will 
   return home from hunting. &quot;Around 2:00 PM&quot;, says Liliana. 
   Joe then binds Liliana's hands to Paola's with some rope and waits 
   for Sergio to return. When he does, Joe disarms Sergio, hitting him 
   in the back of his head (See what I mean?) and making him dig in the 
   fireplace dirt by holding the shotgun to his head. Only the shotgun 
   isn't loaded and Sergio tries to take advantage of the situation by 
   putting martial arts moves on Joe, but he fails miserably since Joe 
   is faster and stronger. Joe finds the shotgun shells&nbsp; and is 
   about to shoot Sergio, when Liliana appears (she untied the knots 
   with her teeth) and begs Joe not to kill her husband. Secrets are 
   then revealed, as Paola admits that Sergio cheated on Liliana...with 
   her! It seems this trio is more fucked-up than Joe, but will Joe keep 
   his promise to leave once the loot is dug up? Don't count on it.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When the loot is dug up, revealing to to be 300 million lire in 
   cash, they all have lire signs in the pupils of their eyes. Money, 
   especially this large amount, brings out the worst in people and this 
   trio of &quot;innocents&quot; are no exception. Paola offers to be 
   Joe's fuck buddy, saying she will travel with him and help him spend 
   the money, but Joe knows what a worthless twat she is, forcing Paola 
   and Sergio to strip naked and make love in front of Liliana. After 
   Sergio ejaculates (thankfully offscreen), Joe blows a hole in the 
   bedroom wall and tells Sergio and Paula to ge to sleep, taking 
   Liliana into another room to watch him transfer the cash into a 
   plastic bag. Meanwhile Paola and Sergio are coming up with a plan to 
   get their greedy little hands on the cash. Will they succeed?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   the farmhouse and its two rooms, the living room (where posters of 
   Marlon Brando and John Travolta hang on the wall) and the bedroom. 
   The film suffers because of this, as there are no prerequisite car

   level is also rather subdued, just Joe bashing people on the head and 
   threatening them with the shotgun. Even the film's violent and rushed

   theaters down South in 1973 and then disappeared into obscurity. The

   (1989) -</B> There's a psycho on the loose in Rome. We first see him 
   stopping his car (where his shoes miraculously change color!) and 
   chopping off the hand of a prostitute with a hatchet. He then cuts 
   off her head and rapes her headless body (thankfully, off screen). 
   But what does that have to do with Jennifer (Patrizia Falcone), an 
   actress who is starring in a horror film directed by Frank (Maurice 
   Poli; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#FiveDolls1970">FIVE DOLLS FOR 
   AN AUGUST MOON</A></B> - 1970)? Frank gathers all the actors and crew 
   on the film for dinner, telling then he has decided to make this 
   horror film as &quot;realistic&quot; as possible, so he has hired 
   Madam Yurich (Anna Maria Placido; <B><A HREF="murder_secret_1989.htm">THE
    MURDER SECRET</A></B> - 1989), a real medium, to perform a 
   s&eacute;ance, which he will film and include in his horror movie (a 
   zombie film titled &quot;Dirty Blood&quot;). This doesn't go over too 
   well with the male star of the film, Robert (Pier Maria Cecchini; <B><A HREF="card_player_2004.htm">THE
    CARD PLAYER</A></B> - 2004), and some of the crew, who only want to

   town as quickly as possible.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Jennifer's boyfriend, Walter (Gino Concare) is a police detective 
   and a technical advisor on the film. He is also in charge of solving 
   the prostitute's murder. Very soon, fantasy and reality will blur 
   together, as Madam Yurich gathers everyone together and performs a s&eacute;ance,<A HREF="massacre_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/massacre 1989 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   contacting her &quot;spiritual advisor&quot;, a spirit by the name of 
   Gabor. Only she doesn't contact Gabor, she contacts someone (or 
   something) far more dangerous, a spirit by the name of 
   &quot;Rack&quot;. During the s&eacute;ance, which is being held in a 
   room in a hotel, the bottles of booze at the bar Walter is sitting at 
   shatter on their own and Walter falls to the floor, looking like he 
   has seen something beyond his comprehension. After the s&eacute;ance 
   is over, Madam Yurich tells everyone that Rack is the personification 
   of evil and if she truly did get in contact with this evil spirit, 
   everyone's life is in mortal danger (Madam Yurich has no memory of 
   the s&eacute;ance).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    It's not long before members of the cast and crew are found brutally 
   murdered, the first victim being Robert's girlfriend, Liza (Silvia 
   Conti). She is found on a merry-go-round, a metal spike driven 
   through her skull. Walter and the other detectives on the case think 
   the psycho who killed the prostitute is responsible for Liza's death, 
   but the question remains: Is the psycho really responsible? The next 
   murder victim is Madam Yurich. She has car trouble and has to pull 
   over to the side of the road. Another car pulls behind her and when 
   the person gets out, Madam Yurich recognizes the person (These parts 
   of the film are lensed like a giallo flick, as all we see are the 
   killer's POV). That night, as Jennifer and Walter are taking a 
   romantic stroll down the street, Jennifer discovers Madam Yurich's 
   dead body, impaled on an iron grate fence. Walter's boss, the Police 
   Commissioner (Paul Muller; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightmareCastle1965">NIGHTMARE
    CASTLE</A></B> - 1965), is livid, telling Walter he better solve 
   these murders and be quick about it, because his job is on the line. 
   The Commissioner is sick and tired of his detectives acting as 
   bodyguards for the film's cast and crew, finding it a waste of time 
   and money.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see the psycho killing a middle-age couple having sex in a 
   car. He stabs the man repeatedly in the back and chases the naked 
   woman into the woods, where he slices her throat with a knife, only, 
   this time, he is caught by the police. Thinking they have caught the 
   killer, the Commissioner pulls all of the detectives from their 
   detail of protecting the film's crew. Big mistake. The unknown killer 
   then kills three more people working on the film, including gay actor 
   Adrian (Danny Degli Esposito; who does his interpretation of Joel 
   Grey's cross-dressing role in <B><A HREF="cabaret_1972.htm">CABARET</A></B> 
   [1972] for Frank's horror film!), by ripping them apart with a 
   gaffing hook (the killer may have cut off Adrian's penis and put it 
   in his mouth! At least that is what I think I saw.). The Commissioner 
   then chews out Walter again, telling him if he doesn't solve this 
   case, he is &quot;going down the river&quot;, only this time, Walter 
   is defiant, telling the Commissioner, &quot;I'm a good swimmer&quot; 
   and that he pulled the detectives from protecting the crew, so it's 
   the Commissioner's job that is on the line. So who is the killer? If 
   you have read this review, you already know who it is (a blind man 
   could have figured it out!). That's right, it's Walter and he is 
   possessed by Rack. He then begins killing his own men and then goes 
   after Jennifer. Is she about to star in her own personal horror film?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   had to watch to achieve that goal and I must say that I was 
   disappointed. Director Andrea Bianchi, who was quite capable of 
   turning out good films, such as <B><A HREF="what_the_peeper_saw_1972.htm">WHAT

    OF DEATH</A></B> (1987; which makes Jess Franco look like Orson 
   Welles), has committed the worst sin possible for a horror film: He 
   opened the film with its most graphic murder (The footage used in 
   Fulci's film), as the rest of the murders can't hold a candle to the 
   first one. As a matter of fact, the other killings are shown after 
   the fact, as we never see the killer committing them. Another major 
   sin is that Frank's horror film seems more interesting than the one 
   we are watching, as this is nothing but generic stalk 'n' slash 
   material. It's not terrible, but it's not good, either. It just is. 
   Oh well, another life goal flushed down the crapper. You think I 
   would have learned by now. Very seldom is a life goal satisfying, but

   monograph on Professor Gregorius Wahl (Herbert Boehme; <B><A HREF="puzzle_of_the_red_orchid_1961.htm">THE
    SECRET (PUZZLE) OF THE RED ORCHID</A></B> - 1961) and his family's 
   one hundred years of operating and creating a strange carousel of 
   female serial killers throughout history, which takes place in a 
   windmill. When Hans asks a local where Professor Wahl lives, he 
   replies in the Mill of the Stone Women. When Hans asks the local why 
   he calls it that, he says he doesn't know, it has been called that 
   ever since he can remember, as people come from all over to watch the 
   weird carousel of realistic-looking stone women display their crimes. 
   When Hans arrives at the windmill, he meets housekeeper Selma (Olga 
   Solbelli; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#ThirdEye1966">THE THIRD EYE</A></B> 
   - 1966), who brings him inside and tells him to wait there and not 
   wander off. Hans hears some piano music playing in the background and 
   when it stops, a beautiful, yet pasty-faced, young woman peers out of 
   the curtains and looks at Hans with lust in her eyes. Before Hans can 
   approach her, Selma again appears and shows him to a room, locking 
   the door so Hans cannot leave (or to stop someone from getting in). 
   Hans begins hearing a woman scream as if she is in severe pain, but 
   before he can do anything Professor Wahl appears and tells Hans that 
   he is very busy, so he will only give him six days to write his 
   monograph, showing him to a secluded room in the windmill where he 
   will work. He is under no circumstances to leave the room except to 
   leave the windmill at night when he is finished for the day. On the 
   first day Hans is there, the beautiful white-faced woman appears 
   again and tells him her name is Elfie (Scilla Gabel; <B><A HREF="bastard_go_and_kill_1971.htm">BASTARD,
    GO AND KILL</A></B> - 1971), the Professor's daughter. She tells 
   Hans she must see him tonight at 11:00 PM and not to worry about 
   anyone catching them because everyone will be asleep. Hans agrees and 
   then goes to a restaurant to meet his girlfriend Liselotte (Dany 
   Carrel; <B><A HREF="hands_of_orlac_1960.htm">THE HANDS OF ORLAC</A></B> 
   - 1960) and his best friend, the womanizing Ralf (Marco Guglielmi; <B><A HREF="how_to_kill_a_judge_1974.htm">HOW
    TO KILL A JUDGE</A></B> - 1974). Both Liselotte and Ralf are 
   students at a university where the Professor teaches sculpture and 
   life classes (i.e. drawing the naked human body). Hans asks Ralf if 
   the Professor has a daughter and he says yes, but no one has ever 
   seen her, as the Professor never lets her leave the windmill. 
   Liselotte leaves in a huff because Hans is talking about another 
   woman, so Hans sends Ralf to go to her and talk some sense into her 
   (Yes, send a womanizer to talk sense into a hurt woman!). At 11:00 
   PM, Hans meets Elfie in her bedroom, where she professes her love for 
   him and they make love. The next morning, Liselotte and Ralf meet 
   Hans at the windmill, and when Elfie sees Hans hugging and kissing 
   Liselotte, she becomes instantly jealous, writing Hans a threatening 
   note and leaving it in his work room.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When Liselotte and Ralf leave, The Professor pulls Hans into his 
   office and tells him he is to have no further contact with Elfie. The 
   Professor explains that Elfie suffers from a rare blood disease and 
   any excitement will kill her, which is why Dr. Loren Bohlem (Wolfgang 
   Preiss; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BloodstainButter71">THE BLOODSTAINED BUTTERFLY</A></B> 
   - 1971) also lives in the windmill. He is there to make sure his 
   daughter doesn't die, but the Professor doesn't know that Dr. Bohlem 
   loves Elfie, even though she can't stand him. Dr. Bohlem is trying to 
   create a formula to cure Elfie of her disease, but her blood type is 
   so rare, it is almost impossible to duplicate it or find someone with 
   the same type blood. That afternoon, Liselotte and Ralf come to the 
   windmill to watch the carousel in action, but it becomes too 
   frightening to Liselotte (The stone female figures look real to her) 
   and she passes out. The Professor gives smelling salts to Ralf to 
   administer to Liselotte and when she comes to, the Professor sees 
   that one of her hatpins has scratched her face, so he uses his 
   handkerchief to wipe off the blood (HUGE clue!). While Hans is 
   working in his room, Elfie comes in and apologizes for writing the 
   threatening note, saying she got mad when she saw him kissing another 
   woman. Hans tells Elfie that he can never love her and Elfie is fine 
   with that, telling him that her love for him will sustain her. When 
   Hans refuses to kiss her, Elfie falls down unconscious and Hans 
   carries her to her bed, He uses a mirror to check her breathing when 
   he sees blood trickling out of the side of her mouth, only to 
   discover that she is dead. Not wanting to lose his job or tell the 
   Professor what happened, he just leaves Elfie in her bedroom and says 
   nothing, but guilt begins to drive Hans insane (he has quite the 
   &quot;freak-out&quot; scene!), especially when he goes down into the 
   windmill's basement and sees Elfie strapped to a table next to a 
   red-haired woman, who is strapped to a table next to her. Hans' mind 
   snaps and a doctor puts Hans on bedrest for a few days to hopefully 
   recuperate, with Liselotte seeing to his every need.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When Hans returns to his normal self, Liselotte disappears and he 
   tells Ralf what he saw in the windmill's basement. A black &amp; 
   white photo in Liselotte's room shows her standing next to a woman, 
   the same woman that Hans saw strapped to a table next to Elfie. When 
   Hans tells Ralf she has red hair, Ralf has no other choice but to 
   believe him, since the woman, named Annelore (Liana Orfei; <B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#HercSam&amp;Ulys1963">HERCULES,
    SAMSON AND ULYSSES</A></B> - 1963), was a model in one of Liselotte 
   and his life classes that the Professor taught and Hans could only 
   know she had red hair if he actually saw her, since the photo was in 
   black &amp; white. We then see how Dr. Bohlem brings back Elfie to 
   life time after time. This time, using Annelore, they drain her of 
   all her red blood cells and put them onto Elfie's body, but it is 
   only a temporary solution. Professor Wahl then mummifies Annelore's 
   body (we watch as he does it step-by-step and it's quite hard to 
   watch) and turns her into one of the carousel's exibits, something he 
   has done to all of the victims who brought Elfie back to life. Hans 
   and Ralf race to the windmill, knowing that Liselotte is going to be 
   the next victim, but what they don't know is the Liselotte is to be 
   the final victim, as she has the type of blood needed for Dr. Bolem 
   to create the formula to cure Elfie of her disease (Dr. Bohlem tested 
   the blood on the Professor's handkerchief). With Liselotte strapped 
   to the table (her naked nipples prominently displayed! If you don't 
   see them, you have the edited version), Dr. Bohlem tells the 
   Professor that he will cure Elfie under one condition: She will 
   become his wife. The Professor laughs and says that will never 
   happen; his daughter deserves someone much better than a disgraced 
   doctor he saved from the gallows. This results in a fight where the 
   Professor kills Dr. Bohlem. As the Professor starts the blood 
   transference and is about to use the formula to cure his daughter, he 
   can't find the syringe where he saw Dr. Bohlem place it, not knowing 
   Dr. Bohlem pocketed the syringe just before he made his demands. As 
   Elfie's life drains from her body, the Professor finds the syringe in 
   Dr. Bohlem's lab jacket, broken during their fight. Feeling defeated, 
   the Professor sets fire to the windmill, as Hans and Ralf rescue 
   Liselotte and flee the burning windmill. The Professor carries a 
   dying Elfie and they sit atop the carousel, watching the female 
   serial killer figures burning (including Annelore's) and revealing 
   they all have human skulls, as the fire burns all around them (try to 
   ignore the shot of the burning windmill, which is obviously a 
   miniature model). <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">THE END</FONT></B>.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   things we never thought we would see in a 1960 horror film (The more 
   that I watch these early-'60s Italian Gothic horror films, the less 
   surprised I become!). The nudity shown in this film comes out of left 
   field, especially when showing Liselotte's nipples as she is strapped 
   to the table. If you aren't looking specifically there, you may miss 
   them, as the camera doesn't linger, but there are two scenes that 
   show them, so it was no mistake. The TV version of this film 
   specifically edits them out, as well as scenes of&nbsp; the stone 
   figures burning and revealing their skulls (I mistakenly watched the 
   edited version on YouTube before I found the unedited version 
   streaming on Amazon Prime, which I had to pay for.). It even edits 
   out a head falling off one of the figures. It shows us nothing, even 
   though Hans picks it up, looks at it and tells Ralf that it is a 
   mummified human head, before dropping it to the floor (the edited 
   version does show the head lying on the floor, though). This is still 
   a well-made film full of atmospheric sequences, especially the first 
   time we see the carousel in action, as women in various freaky poses 
   slide across a track, revealing themselves one-by-one. There's a 
   woman who has her head on a chopping block, ready to have it 
   separated from her body, another tied to a stake and ready to be 
   burned and still another with a noose around her neck, the look on 
   her choking face horrifying. This was one of those films that use to 
   be a staple on TV during my childhood, but it's nothing quite like 
   what you will see in the unedited version, including frank talks 
   about sex. There's enough weirdness in this film for me to give it a 
   big thumbs-up, so catch it if you can, but remember to avoid the 
   edited version.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   that he has found the tomb he has been looking for all his life. The 
   earthquake has revealed vast underground tunnels, one of them leading 
   to the tomb of an ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Mummy King, who was a 
   sorcerer who could &quot;bring back to life things that were 
   lifeless. He could transform a dead body into a living creature.&quot;
    A wall of hieroglyphics leading to the tomb is actually a curse to anyone<A HREF="mummy_theme_park_2000.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mummy theme park british dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   who dares disturb the Mummy King. The Professor translates the curse 
   to the Sheik, which scares the crap out of the Egyptian workers, who 
   begin running away, but the Sheik orders them to come back and open 
   the tomb immediately, saying anyone who believes in curses in this 
   day and age is a coward. The workers don't care and run away, so the 
   Sheik tells his guards to shoot them in the back, which they do (The 
   Professor watches and smiles!). One worker's life is spared and the 
   Sheik orders him to open the tomb with a crowbar (!), but one of 
   Nekhebet's followers throws a knife and kills the worker. The 
   follower is shot and mortally wounded, but before he dies, he tells 
   the Professor and Sheik that he is the Guardian of the Pharaoh's Tomb 
   and is there to protect the &quot;great secret&quot; the tomb holds. 
   The Sheik asks the Professor what this all means and he says, 
   &quot;The world of the dead, so important to ancient Egyptians, was 
   under the protection of Anubis. This God is always represented with 
   the head of a jackal, which was a sacred animal. The Egyptians built 
   their pyramids on the edge of the desert to protect the dead from 
   being devoured by beasts of prey, so that these bodies could journey 
   to the next world intact. They regarded jackals as guardians of the 
   Necropolis.&quot; The Sheik says, &quot;That's a load of 
   bullshit!&quot; and says he will open the tomb himself, picking up 
   the crowbar and opening the tomb with a single thrust! A bright light 
   envelopes everyone&nbsp; as the Sheik laughs maniacally.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    <B>Six Months Later:</B> We see professional photographer Daniel 
   Flynn (Adam O'Neil) taking photos of models in various states of 
   undress. The Sheik phones Daniel's studio saying that he is in need 
   of their services here in Egypt, sending an $80,000 retainer for 
   their best photographer. Daniel's boss, Richard (John Gayford; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WhatDoneSolange1972">WHAT
    HAVE YOU DONE TO SOLANGE?</A></B> - 1972), asks what the assignment 
   entails and the Sheik says it is highly confidential, but the photos 
   must be sensational. Daniel is assigned to go to Egypt, along with 
   his assistant (but not girlfriend) Julie (Holly Laningham). The Sheik 
   is a very cruel man, as all his harem girls have &quot;Property Of 
   The Sheik&quot; tattoed on various parts of their bodies and we watch 
   as he punishes a servant for doing something wrong by binding him in 
   a small pool while a large snake bites and constricts his body, 
   killing him (The Sheik's guards laugh as they watch it happen on 
   close circuit TV!). When Daniel and Julie arrive in Cairo, Daniel 
   sees a&nbsp; (model) train traveling in the desert and asks the 
   driver where it is going. He tells Daniel it is going to Hades, which 
   is the driver's name for the Sheik's Mummy Theme Park, which he has 
   built in the tunnels and the tomb of the Mummy King. Heck, what could 
   possibly go wrong? Daniel and Julie are greeted at the Sheik's 
   enormous palace by the beautiful Nekhebet, whom the Sheik wants to 
   bed, but she constantly turns down his sexual advances, making him 
   furious (He tells all his beautiful harem girls to leave because they 
   offend his eyes!). When Julie tells Nekhebet she has a strange, 
   funny-sounding name, she tells Julie, &quot;It's an important name in 
   Egypt. One of our greatest ancient divinities. She has the head of a 
   snake. It's a symbol for the Goddess of Eternity.&quot; Julie is a 
   piece of work, belittling Nekhebet's name, asking her if she knows 
   any ancient pharaohs, which she shouldn't have done, because it makes 
   Nekhebet very mad. She puts a curse on both Julie and Daniel, making 
   their stay in Cairo very unnerving. Someone throws a miniature Sphinx 
   statue wrapped in unreadable text (at least for Daniel) through 
   Daniel's bedroom window on the very first night he is there (One of 
   the Sheik's harem girls says that Julie is very pretty and the main 
   harem girl [Paola Real] retorts, &quot;You mean that bulemic bag of 
   bones? I could eat her for breakfast!&quot;).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When Daniel and Julie first meet the Sheik, he gives them a virtual 
   tour of his Mummy Theme park, which is like <B><A HREF="westworld_1973.htm">WESTWORLD</A></B> 
   (1973) but with mummies, as nearly every character in the park is a 
   robot, all of them under constant surveillance by a team of 
   technicians via CCTV and computers. A team of geologists are also on 
   hand to make sure the ancient necropolis is not once again lost 
   should the crevasse suddenly close again (Or, according to Daniel, 
   &quot;The Earth will once more swallow what it vomited up.&quot; Say 
   what you want, but he has a way with words!). The Sheik tells Daniel 
   and Julie that he has taken into consideration every conceivable 
   problem that could arise and assures them that the train ride that 
   travels through the theme park is 100% safe, but since he doesn't 
   believe in ancient curses, that safe percentage is about to go down 
   99 percentage points into a very deadly zone: The Mummy Zone!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Daniel and Julie take a train ride through the theme park with the 
   Sheik so Daniel knows what to photograph the following day. The Sheik 
   tells the pair that they will see robotic mummies come to life, 
   unaware that Nekhebet is summoning the real Mummy King and his 
   Guardians back to life. We watch one of the Sheik's guards become 
   possessed,&nbsp; as his tongue falls out of his mouth (!) and a huge 
   mass of flesh escapes from his over-stretched mouth, turning him into 
   creature that can best be described as a snake-headed demon with a 
   huge forked tongue. The funniest part of the tour is when the train 
   stops halfway though its journey at the park's concession stand and 
   souvenier shop, where the Sheik orders a beer ($10), which comes out 
   of a tap of a miniature Sphinx's chin beard! Daniel orders an ice tea 
   ($5), which comes out of another mini Sphinx, and Julie orders a 
   container of popcorn (price unknown). When the man behind the counter 
   looks for payment, the Sheik says, &quot;We'll settle up later.&quot; 
   I nearly pissed my pants I was laugh so hard, as the look on the 
   counter man's face is priceless.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    That night, we watch the harem girls get into a catfight when one of 
   them mentions dying her hair blonde like Julie, but the main harem 
   girl tells her she will look like a tart, as a slap-fight commences. 
   The Sheik tells his &quot;sorcerers&quot;, &quot;Tonight I want to 
   dream of magic&quot;, so one of the men sets up a mat on the floor 
   and tells the Sheik, &quot;Tonight you will see beautiful things you 
   cannot touch.&quot;, as they burn some incense, play the flute and 
   bang on bongos, while a ghostly girl dances provocatively. The Sheik 
   is not satisfied, saying, &quot;I want a real girl! In the flesh! 
   Live!&quot;, throwing a coconut and beaning one of the men in the 
   head. What happens next, you'll have to experience for yourself, 
   because mere words cannot describe it (It ends with the main sorcerer 
   being thrown in the small pool with the large snake).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Daniel takes the paper that the miniature Sphinx (that was thrown 
   through his window) was wrapped in for a translation by Professor 
   Mason, who says the paper is a threatening letter written in ancient 
   Egyptian hieroglyphics, stating everyone is going to die horribly if 
   the theme park is opened. When Daniel tells Julie that they are 
   leaving immediately after he takes the photos tomorrow morning, 
   Julie, who is barely dressed, gets all clingy with Daniel, right 
   after telling him she never thought of dating him, he is not her idea 
   of boyfriend material. What follows next is the cheesiest thirty 
   minutes you are ever likely to see, as the gauze-wrapped mummy begins 
   killing every living person in his path, beginning with the Sheik's 
   guards, who are dismembered and decapitated by tyhe sword-swinging 
   mummy. When Daniel is taking photos in the park's &quot;Mummy 
   Birthing Chamber&quot;, which was built on top of the Pharaoh Mummy 
   King's tomb, Daniel and Julie become trapped in the theme park, the 
   mummy chasing them while the Sheik blocks all means that allow them 
   to escape, telling his guards, &quot;Do you know how much I spent on 
   this park?!?&quot; The mummy becomes enamored with Julie's breasts 
   (!), so Daniel tells her, &quot;Just open your blouse. It's the only 
   thing that will slow him down!&quot; (I'm sure soda shot through my 
   nose when I heard that line of dialogue!). Julie runs around holding 
   her blouse open while the mummy stares at her, mesmerized, giving 
   Daniel enough time to pour a bucket of acid on the mummy, nearly 
   dissolving it (Where in the hell did he find acid???). The 
   acid-scarred skeletal mummy (now an awful practical effect dummy) 
   chases the pair through the park (consider it a cheapjack version of 
   the ending of <B><A HREF="terminator_1984.htm">THE TERMINATOR</A></B> 
   - 1984), but no matter how many times they think they have killed it, 
   the dummy mummy keeps bouncing back. Is there any way to stop this 
   curse? Will the Sheik ever recoup the $250 million he spent on the 
   theme park? Will I ever regain my sanity after watching this goofy 
   film? The answers to all of these questions are the same: no. Oh 
   well, sanity is over-rated anyway.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   anyone with a computer and a bunch of balsa wood. The train ride 
   through the theme park will make you howl with laughter, as 
   everything seen through the train car's windows are obviously green 
   screened miniature effects. Believe me when I say films don't come 
   more threadbare than this, as Passeri, who co-wrote the screenplay 
   with Anthony Pedicini (who worked in the Art Department on Roger 
   Corman's <B><A HREF="battle_beyond_the_stars_1980.htm">BATTLE BEYOND 
   THE STARS</A></B> - 1980), makes sure there is nothing in the script 
   that can't be created with cheap CGI, including a man getting his 
   head cleaved in two by the sword-wielding mummy. Just like <B><A HREF="creatures_from_the_abyss_1994.htm">CREATURES</A></B>,
    you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. I really can't 
   say more than that. You'll know right away if this film is for you 
   just by watching the opening minutes. It's full of hilarious dialogue 
   (especially what comes out of the Sheik's mouth), has acting that can 
   best be described as unbelievable and the special effects are so bad, 
   it looks like the film was made for the change Passeri found under 
   his couch cushions. Films like this don't come around often, but 
   Passeri followed this up with the severely retarded <B><A HREF="flight_to_hell_2003.htm">FLIGHT
    TO HELL</A></B> (2003; look for a review soon) and the even harder 
   to find <B><A HREF="psychovision_2003.htm">PSYCHOVISION</A></B> 
   (2003; I'm still searching for it). I would like to thank my friend 
   Steven from across the pond for alerting me to this film. It was just 
   what I needed when quarantined in my apartment for six weeks due to 
   the COVID-19 pandemic. This flick makes Bruno Mattei's supremely bad 
   mummy film <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Tomb2004">THE TOMB</A></B> 
   (2004) look like an A-List production, but that's not necessarily a 
   bad thing because we all need a braindead film like this every so often.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This film was made for video and got very little distribution around 
   the world, except for Italy, Germany, Japan and the U.K., where it 
   received VHS and DVD releases. It is available streaming on YouTube 
   on channel &quot;HelloSpiral777&quot; and, believe it or not, it is 
   also available on Tubi, who offer it uncut, with very short 
   commercial breaks every twenty minutes or so. Those are your only 
   choices in the States, as there are no legitimate disc releases. Also 
   featuring Beth Holland, Clive Riche (<B><A HREF="cemetery_man_1994.htm">CEMETERY

   Mark Anazald as the Mummy. <B>Not Rated</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>
