    the name Lee Frost and most people will say, &quot;Who?&quot; Some 
   people might even remember him for his exploitation films of the 
   70's, such as the hilariously campy <B><A HREF="thing_with_two_heads_1972.htm">THE
    THING WITH TWO HEADS</A></B> (1972 - where bigot Ray Milland has his 
   head sewn on to the body of big black ex-footballer Rosey Grier), the 
   biker film <B><A HREF="chrome_and_hot_leather_1971.htm">CHROME AND 
   HOT LEATHER</A></B> (1971) or the black actioner <B><A HREF="black_gestapo_1975.htm">THE
    BLACK GESTAPO</A></B> (1975). What many people do not know is that 
   Lee Frost (who also used the names Les Emerson, R.L. Frost and Robert 
   L. Frost when making films) was by then an accomplished director/writer/actor
    who was one of the best of a crop of low-budget filmmakers who got 
   their start in the field of early 60's sexploitation sleaze. Lee 
   Frost (real name: Ralph Lee Frost) came into prominence in 1962 with 
   a little no-budgeter called <B><A HREF="surftide 77.htm">SURFTIDE 77</A></B>.
    It was during that time that he met sleaze producer Bob Cresse 
   (Whose life story would make a great book. He died in 1998.) and the 
   late Wes Bishop, who would collaborate with Frost on most of the 
   films he directed. The partnership that this trio formed would turn 
   out some of the most unusual (and well-made) sexploitation classics 
   that the nudely-aware 60's had to offer. Their first outing as 
   partners was the seminal film <B><A HREF="house_on_bare_mountain_1962.htm">HOUSE
    ON BARE MOUNTAIN</A></B> (1962), which many consider to be the first 
   all-monster/nudie-cutie film. Although tame by<A HREF="love_camp_7_1969.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/love camp 7.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="105" HEIGHT="164" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   today's standards, this film proved to be a bonanza at the boxoffice, 
   making millions from an audience starving to see nude (and quite 
   attractive) women. Filmed in three days for a few thousand bucks, <B>HOUSE</B> 
   paved the way for other filmmakers to make their own monster/nudies, 
   including Peter Perry's infamous <B>DR. B</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">REEDLOVE</FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"> 
   (1964 - aka <B><A HREF="kiss me quick.htm">KISS ME QUICK</A></B>). 
   The success of <B>HOUSE</B> afforded the trio to make more nudie 
   films. Some of those titles included: <B>LOVE IS A FOUR LETTER WORD</B> 
   (1963), <B><A HREF="hollywoods world of flesh.htm">HOLLYWOOD'S WORLD

   and <B><A HREF="scavengers.htm">THE SCAVENGERS</A></B> (both 1969) . <B>HOT
    SPUR</B> was one of the first nudie westerns (along with Dave

   and was praised by a lot of critics as being a &quot;fine example of 
   the western tradition&quot; even though it had so much frontal nudity 
   in it. <B>THE SCAVENGERS</B> was about a bunch of Civil War scum who 
   invade a town and rob, torture and rape the townspeople before being 
   put down by a bunch of freed slaves.&nbsp; <B>LOVE CAMP 7</B> was a 
   whole other can of worms. Reviled by critics as an &quot;exploitation 
   of the Holocaust tragedy&quot;, this was the first film to show the 
   horror and bloodshed inside a Nazi concentration camp. Whippings, 
   rapes, <A HREF="house_on_bare_mountain_1962.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/houseonbaremountain.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="209" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="2"></A>orgies
    and torture are shown rather gleefully, not helped by the fact that 
   most of the Nazis are portrayed by Jewish men (including Bob Cresse 
   as a scene-chewing commandant). Noted for its frequent use of flesh 
   (but no pubic hair), <B>LOVE CAMP 7</B> was the precursor of such 
   films as <B><A HREF="ilsa_she_wolf_of_the_ss_1974.htm">ILSA-SHE WOLF 
   OF THE SS</A></B> (1975)<B> </B>and the countless Italian imitations 
   of the 70's. <B>LOVE CAMP 7</B> played to packed audiences all over 
   the world and was one of the films that led to the &quot;Video 
   Nasties&quot; ban in England in the early 80's. Lee Frost was not 
   just a director. During the 60's he handled the chores of dubbing, 
   shooting additional scenes and editing foreign-made films that Cresse 
   picked up for U.S. distribution. If a film was considered too 
   &quot;tame&quot; for America's newly-found thirst for filmic flesh, 
   Frost would shoot inserts which contained nudity, often seemlessly 
   inserting them so that audiences weren't aware that they were added. 
   Films such as <B><A HREF="festival girls.htm">FESTIVAL GIRLS</A></B> 
   (1962), <B><A HREF="night of lust.htm">NIGHT OF LUST</A></B> (1965) 
   and <B><A HREF="massacre of pleasure.htm">MASSACRE OF PLEASURE</A></B> 
   (1966) contained Frost's superb insert technique. When Cresse would 
   acquire some Japanese films for U.S. release, he would hire Frost to 
   direct the dubbing. Frost would at least try to match the actors' 
   lips, something you don't see in the dubbed versions of the Godzilla 
   or other giant monster flicks. Frost directed the dubbing on <B>THE BITE</B> (1966)<B>,

   (1966 - a.k.a. <B>ABNORMAL</B>), <B>ADOLESCENCE</B> (1967) and many 
   others. Frost was also an expert editor and cinematographer, working 
   on such films as <B><A HREF="ecco.htm">ECCO</A></B> (1965) and <B><A HREF="#Zero In Scream">ZERO
    IN AND SCREAM</A></B> (1970 - with Frost using the name &quot;Les 
   Emerson&quot;). As the 70's approached, Frost dissolved his 
   partnership with Cresse (Cresse retired from the business after 
   getting shot in the stomach trying to help a woman who<A HREF="black_gestapo_1975.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/black gestapo.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="122" HEIGHT="180" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   was being beaten up). Frost, along with Wes Bishop, made some 
   enjoyable exploitation pictures for the major independents. Frost 
   directed <B><A HREF="chrome_and_hot_leather_1971.htm">CHROME AND HOT LEATHER</A> </B>and
    <B><A HREF="thing_with_two_heads_1972b.htm">THE THING WITH TWO HEADS</A></B>

    WARRIORS</A></B>) for Bryanston Films. <B>GESTAPO</B> is probably my 
   favorite Frost Film, partly because it is a brutal blaxploitation 
   film (a man has his nuts cut off and flushed down the toilet!) and 
   partly because Frost and Bishop have roles as white gangsters who 
   manage to get beaten up in every scene they are in (Frost also had a 
   small part in John Hayes' <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Garden Dead">GARDEN
    OF THE DEAD</A></B> - 1972). This film is also interesting to see 
   how Charles Robinson (Mac on TV's <B><A HREF="night_court_tv.htm">NIGHT
    COURT</A></B>) got his start. He plays the ruthless leader of a band 
   of black vigilantes who thinks he's above the law. The Internet Movie 
   Database (<A HREF="http://www.imdb.com">www.imdb.com</A>) lists that 
   Frost directed the film <B><A HREF="slaves_in_cages.htm">SLAVES IN CAGES</A></B> 
   (1972) using the name &quot;Carl Borcht&quot;, but I find it highly 
   suspect. This site is riddled with inaccuracies. Frost and Bishop 
   also wrote the screenplay to the extremely popular cult film <B><A HREF="race_with_the_devil_1975.htm">RACE
    WITH THE DEVIL</A></B> (1975), directed by the late Jack Starrett.

    conclusion, <B>RACE</B> caught on with public with its mix of car

   on drive-in double and triple bills. Frost was also responsible for <B><A HREF="#DixieDynamite">DIXIE

   (see review below). To this date, that is his last directorial 
   credit. During the 80's and early 90's Frost worked at a film 
   laboratory editing industrial films. With his high output of unusual 
   films, it's about time for someone to rediscover his early films. Lee 
   Frost was a pioneer in the field of early exploitation and deserves 
   the same type of recognition that Dave Friedman, H.G. Lewis, Barry 
   Mahon, Doris Wishman and Harry Novak are currently receiving. His 
   films were nothing short of professional, even when he didn't have a 
   lot of money to work with. Most of his early films can be purchased 
   from <A HREF="http://www.somethingweird.com">Something Weird Video</A>.
    I tip my hat to the late Mike Vraney for all the good he had done in 
   getting these films available to all the new viewers too young to 
   recall them. For an intimate interview with the elusive Mr. Frost

    DYNAMITE</A><A NAME="DixieDynamite"></A> (1976) -</B> The Feds 
   converge on Bandera County, Georgia and force Sheriff Phil Marsh 
   (Christopher George) to arrest moonshiner Tom Eldridge (Mark Miller) 
   for running an illegal still. Tom breaks free and a car chase ensues 
   (where the cars smash through a fruit stand and a chicken coop, both 
   car chase staples) and evil Deputy Frank (co-producer/co-scripter Wes 
   Bishop) shoots out one of Tom's tires, causing his car to veer off 
   the side of an embankment and explode, killing Tom. Sheriff Marsh, 
   who is a decent guy caught up in circumstances beyond his control, 
   forces Deputy Frank to tell Tom's two daughters, Dixie (Jane Anne 
   Johnstone) and Patsy (Kathy McHaley), the bad news. Mack (Warren 
   Oates), a motorcross racer and good friend of Tom and the girls, 
   promises Dixie and Patsy that everything will be OK, but that 
   couldn't be farther from the truth. The kindly bank manager (R.G. 
   Armstrong) is able to hold off mortgage payments on their farm for 
   three months, but with little prospects for jobs and an evil 
   businessman name Dade McCrutchen (Stanley Adams) who wants to 
   foreclose on all delinquent mortgages and buy-up the properties, 
   Dixie and Patsy are in serious financial problems. McCrutchen has 
   inside knowledge that the properties are sitting on top of a fortune 
   in natural gas, so he blackmails the bank manager to foreclose on 
   Dixie and Patsy's farm. When Patsy gets caught shoplifting in the 
   town grocery store, Deputy Frank drives her out to the<A HREF="dixie_dynamite_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dixie dynamite dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="173" HEIGHT="245" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   sticks and rapes her, telling her later that if she says anything 
   about it, he will throw her in jail for the shoplifting charge. Dixie 
   and Patsy are then thrown out of their home and, at the auction of 
   their property, McCrutchen buys the farm for the minimum $14,000 bid 
   when the girls are unable to raise the money. Dixie comes up with a 
   plan for retribution, but first she has Mack teach her and Patsy how 
   to ride dirt bikes. The girls then steal two motorcycles, a couple of 
   rifles and a truckload of dynamite out of a quarry and proceed to 
   blow up McCrutchen's operation, one piece at a time. They become the 
   county's public enemy number one (and two) and a reluctant Sheriff 
   Marsh is forced to hire additional men to capture them. Things come 
   to a boiling point when the girls plan on robbing the town bank and 
   stealing all of McCrutchen's money (as well as destroying all the 
   foreclosure papers). The girls pull off the bank job (an ingenious 
   plan that entails a bomb and the corpses of two female stiffs that 
   they have stolen) and then blow up McCrutchen in his limousine so 
   that his car goes down the same embankment where their father was 
   killed. Dixie, Patsy and Mack take the loot and move to Rio De 
   Janiero, where they live high on the hog.&nbsp; This PG-rated action/exploitation
    flick, directed and co-written by the late Lee Frost, is a funny and 
   sometimes shocking piece of genre filmmaking. This is an 
   old-fashioned &quot;good old boy&quot; Southern action film, where 
   the bad guys are just plain bad and the good guys (and girls) are 
   very good until pushed to the breaking point. The standout here is 
   Wes Bishop as Deputy Frank, a slimy police officer who's a little too 
   quick on the trigger. After being responsible for Tom's death and 
   then shooting an unarmed drunk in a bar fight (not to mention the 
   rape of Patsy), Sheriff Marsh rightfully fires him (&quot;You don't 
   pull a gun in a bar fight!&quot;) and he takes a job as a security 
   guard at the quarry. After stealing the truckload of dynamite while 
   under his watch, the girls later humiliate him at the side of a road, 
   stealing his gun and making him plead for his life. After thinking he 
   dodged a bullet, Frank goes home and calls Sheriff Marsh to report it 
   (he doesn't mention his gun being stolen or pleading for his life, 
   though) and is then blown sky-high in his bathroom while taking a 
   piss, thanks to a bomb the girls planted in his toilet! Warren Oates 
   is wasted here and spends most of his screen time behind a motorcycle 
   helmet (an obvious stuntman) or looking embarrassed. It is also said 
   that one of the dirt bike riders was none other than Steve McQueen, 
   who was bored and did some uncredited stuntwork for $200. Christopher 
   George is good as the sheriff that doesn't try too hard to catch the 
   girls (even though they kill at least three people on-screen) and Lee 
   Frost cameos as a pathologist. All-in-all, this is a fun little 
   exploitation flick that contains songs by Duane Eddy, The Mike Curb 
   Congregation, Porter Jordan, Jerry Styner and Warren Oates but, since 
   this is rated PG, there is no nudity, which is a little 
   disappointing. Both Jane Anne Johnstone and Kathy McHaley (this is 
   their only screen credit) wear plenty of skimpy outfits, though.

   After foiling a major jailbreak at a female prison where only two 
   prisoners escape, policewoman Lacy Brown (Sondra Currie) is promoted 
   to go undercover and investigate a gang of female gold smugglers and 
   smash their ring. Before she does that, she has to prove herself to 
   some chauvanistic cops who believe she is not up for the job. After 
   passing her shooting and driving tests with flying colors, she then 
   takes on the police karate instructor (William Smith), beating him to 
   a pulp after he treats her like a little girl. After fitting her <A HREF="policewomen_1974b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/policewomen dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="192" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>with
    a tracking device, her new partner, Frank (Tony Young) and Lacy go 
   undercover as a couple to spy on the gang. Her cover is nearly blown, 
   thanks to some bumbling male cops, but Lacy solves the problem by 
   running the person off the road, the car exploding. The leader of the 
   gang is a sprite (and butch-looking) old lady named Maude (Elizabeth 
   Stuart), who has her girls knock over banks, deal in drugs and are 
   involved in other highly illegal doings. The lone male member of the 
   group, Doc (Phil Hoover), is the weight-lifting muscle of the gang 
   and is also Maude's frustrated husband (she turns him down for sex 
   repeatedly, saying she has a headache or that her mouth hurts!). As 
   Lacy starts falling in love with Frank (who is quite useless when it 
   comes to fighting or firing a gun), her cover is blown by one of the 
   two escaped prisoners in the beginning of the film, who have joined 
   Maude's gang. Now Lacy will have to use her street smarts, as well as 
   her police training, to get out of a very life-threatening situation. 
   She finds help with a gang member with a surprise of her own.&nbsp; 
   If it weren't for the frequent female nudity on view and the foul 
   language (the excahnge between a female Chinese and Black gang member 
   is priceless), this Crown International Picture could have been an 
   episode of one of any of the countless police TV series made in the 
   70's. The fact that Lacy hardly gets to join the gang before being 
   outed seems to defeat the entire purpose of her undercover role. 
   Director/writer Lee Frost and producer/writer partner Wes Bishop give 
   us a couple of car chases, a boat chase and some of the lamest 
   martial arts action your eyes will ever witness. Made back in the day 
   when women cops were fairly new to the scene, this film has not aged 
   very well as many of the situations&nbsp; and much of the dialogue 
   seem dated. Still, some of the scenes are funny, including big Bill 
   Smith being defeated by a woman and pouting because she chipped his 
   tooth and split his lip, Maude's frequent hilarious threats towards 
   men (&quot;You'll be walking with your legs close together!&quot;) 
   and Doc's constant disdain for women (&quot;Every one of these cunts 
   is trouble!&quot;). It's an enjoyable relic from the swinging 70's, 
   with decent acting, some beautiful women and lots of tongue-in-cheek 
   dialogue. The only drawback is it's 100 minute running time and some 
   scenes that go on for much too long. A little pruning would have been 
   beneficial. Also starring Jeanie Bell (<B><A HREF="action.htm#TNT Jackson">TNT

    A somewhat crazed fan named Richard (Michael Christian, who is also 
   the Associate Producer) kidnaps world-reknown model Emanuelle 
   (Shannon Whirry) and locks her in a specialy built area of his house 
   complete with breakproof glass,<A HREF="private_obsession_1994.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/private obsession.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="138" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   electronic locks and hidden cameras. Richard begins a slow, torturous 
   campaign to turn Emanuelle into his idea of the perfect woman. 
   Richard knows that she is an advocate of women&#146;s rights and 
   keeps her locked in the room, playing one of her televised speeches 
   over and over again on a TV set next to her bed. When she unplugs the 
   TV, Richard turns off the water, takes away her clothes and refuses 
   to give her anything to eat until she plugs the TV back in. After a 
   couple of days without water or food (she stoops so low as to drink 
   some water from the toilet tank!), she gives in and plugs the TV set 
   back in. Richard turns the water back on, buys her some expensive 
   clothes and cooks her a gourmet dinner. She gets drunk, does a 
   striptease in front of the camera and has hot sex with Richard. After 
   the act is done, Emanuelle unsuccessfully tries to escape, which 
   really ticks Richard off. He takes all her clothes, towels and 
   blankets and turns off the water again until she repents and tells 
   him that it is a man&#146;s world and she will do whatever he wants. 
   Richard accepts her apology and has sex with her again. The tables 
   are turned when Richard is duped by Emanuelle and gets trapped in his 
   own escape-proof rooms. It is now Emanuelle&#146;s turn to play her 
   televised speech over and over again to an unappreciative Richard. 
   And she likes it! Completely devoid of violence, this low-budget 
   erotic thriller relies heavily on the ample naked charms of Shannon 
   Whirry (</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Animal Instincts">ANIMAL

   - 1973) plays Richard as someone who doesn&#146;t need to resort to 
   physical violence to get his way (even Emanuelle&#146;s kidnapping is 
   painless). Richard would rather use mental torture than harm 
   Emanuelle physically. Bo Svenson and Rip Taylor (sans hairpiece) have 
   cameos as a private dick and travel agent respectively. Lee Frost not 
   only wrote and directed, he also edited (he shows some editing 
   prowess in a scene involving a doggie door), wrote the lyrics to some 
   of the songs and puts in a brief appearance as a private dick named 
   Jerry. This film is basically a two character play, and while it is 
   slow going in some spots, it does hold the attention due to 
   Whirry&#146;s uninhibited performance. This is not the best film of 
   Frost&#146;s career, but new Frost is better than no Frost at all.

    IN AND SCREAM</A><A NAME="Zero In Scream"></A> (1970) -</B> A sniper 
   (Michael Stearns) is killing innocent men who are making love in the 
   Hollywood Hills in this compact (63 minutes) little exploitationer 
   from Lee Frost (using the pseudonym &quot;Lee Emerson&quot; here). It 
   seems our sniper has no problem watching women dancing completely 
   naked at the local strip joint, but when she makes love to a man, he 
   believes the man has lost the right to live. His exact words are, 
   &quot;When a man climbs on top of a woman, she becomes ugly!&quot; 
   The sniper is invited to a party by a stripper, where <A HREF="zero_in_and_scream_1970.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/zero in and scream ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="134" HEIGHT="153" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="2"></A>everyone
    but him goes skinnydipping in the pool and begin having sex (both 
   oral and intercourse) in front of him. He gets turned-on in his own 
   way: He gets in his car, drives to a spot where he has visual access 
   to the pool and shoots the man in the pool making love to the 
   stripper with a high-powered rifle. The police are baffled and a 
   radio newscaster begs the sniper to turn himself in. The sniper has 
   dreams of making love to the stripper, but it is apparent that he has 
   problems doing it in real life. The question becomes why? Is it a 
   psychological or physical problem? We finally do learn his name (it's 
   Mike) when he goes to the stripper's house to pay his condolences. He 
   then spies on her having a lesbian tryst that night and the next 
   morning takes her prisoner while he spouts his twisted philosophy, 
   his rifle laying on his lap (I'm sure Freud would have something to 
   say about that). He makes her do a striptease and then rapes her (I 
   guess it was a psychological problem), warning her to keep her mouth 
   shut or he'll be back. She doesn't and he comes back for some sniper 
   revenge, only to have the tables turned on him in the ironic final 
   shot.&nbsp; I am amazed at the amount of full-frontal nudity (both 
   male and female) and sex (which treads dangerously close to hardcore 
   territory) this film has on display. Originally slapped with a 
   self-imposed X rating, this film is primarily a series of softcore 
   loops followed by some quick gun violence. There is one dream 
   sequence where Mike in making love to the stripper in the pool and 
   she is shot by an unseen sniper in the head. Mike grabs his rifle, 
   but is unable to shoot, even though bullets are flying left and 
   right. This could be interpreted as meaning Mike is impotent, but I 
   seriously doubt the film has it's sights set that high. This is 
   basically 63 minutes of sex punctuated by a few moments of violence. 
   Nothing more, nothing less. The print of the film Something Weird has

   Films like this could never be made today. How you feel about that 
   depends on your morality. Also starring Dawna Rae (as the stripper),
