    in my early 40's now, the name Harry Novak and Boxoffice 
   International Pictures brings back some fond, if distant memories. 
   Being a horny teenager in the late 60's and early 70's, going to one 
   of Novak's films meant getting what you wanted: Plenty of tit and ass 
   action, sometimes mixed with gunplay and<A HREF="massage_parlor_wife_1975.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/massage parlor wives.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="104" HEIGHT="196" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>

   the family never talked about, mainly because the types of films he 
   released were considered risque for their day. Many of Novak's films 
   (with titles such as </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="country_hooker_1970.htm">COUNTRY

   has released Novak's adult sexploitation films on video, and many are 
   transferred directly from Novak's own personal prints. But before I 
   get ahead of myself, let me supply a little background information on 
   Mr. Novak. Harry H. Novak was born in the late 1920's (exact date 
   unknown) Chicago. When in his teens, Novak got a job with RKO 
   Pictures distributing movie posters and pressbooks to theaters. After 
   serving a stint in the Army during World War II, he took a job in Los 
   Angeles with RKO booking and selling films as well as designing ads 
   (this would explain why his Boxoffice ads were so effective) with 
   branch manager Seymour Borde (who would later form his own 
   distribution company). When RKO folded in 1957, Novak went to work 
   booking exploitation films for Seymour Borde's JEM distribution 
   company. After an argument with Borde (in which Novak was fired), 
   Novak formed his own production and distribution company in 1964, 
   calling it Boxoffice International Pictures, naming it after the 
   respected industry magazine Boxoffice. His first release for the 
   newly-formed company was </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">DR.

   to avoid a lawsuit with Stanley <A HREF="behind_locked_doors_1968.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/behind locked doors.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="209" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Kubrick's

    and it was such a hit that it immediately put Boxoffice on the map. 
   This daring for its' time feature was an unusually well-made quickie 
   (directed by former Borde employee Peter Perry using the comical 
   pseudonym &quot;Seymour Tuchas&quot; and photographed by a then 
   unknown Laszlo Kovacs) got plenty of free publicity thanks to a 
   Playboy pictorial displaying plenty of female flesh. With his first 
   film release, Harry Novak's Boxoffice International Pictures became a 
   major independent distributor. The rest is history. To keep up with 
   the public's lusty demand, Novak began production on new sex films (</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="agony_of_love_1965.htm">THE

   - 1966). The audiences ate these pictures up, making Novak a rich 
   man. What made Novak's films so profitable when other producers of 
   nudie films were losing money (with the exception of David F. 
   Friedman)? Novak surrounded himself with talented people. Novak was 
   (and is) a great showman and publicist, but even he knew that there 
   would have to be talented people behind and in front of the camera if 
   a low budget film was to be successful. Directors such as William

   - 1972) not only honed their craft working for Novak, they actually 
   turned in some well-made, entertaining pieces of low-priced 
   exploitation. Sexploitation actresses such as Pat Barrington, Susan 
   Stewart, Rene Bond, Sharon Kelly, Marsha Jordan, Erika Gavin and 
   Uschi Digart were Boxoffice staples. They were not only pleasant to 
   look at (both clothed and naked), they also could act. Novak knew the 
   public's fondness for filmic flesh, but he also knew the stigma bad 
   acting could bring to a film. Therefore, more times than not, he 
   populated his films with little-known (at least to main-stream 
   audiences), but talented, actors and actresses. Novak's films also 
   tackled some touchy subjects which were considered taboo for their 
   time. </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="toys_are_not_for_children_1971.htm">TOYS

    As I have said before, Novak was a master showman and publicist. He 
   was able to bypass the MPAA ratings system and still get his films 
   shown in theaters and advertised in newspapers that would otherwise 
   not accept films without a rating. For films he knew would get an 
   X-rating (such as Gary Graver's </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="erikas_hot_summer_1970.htm">ERIKA'S

   the trio), who helps her lug the trunk to the attic. When Canon tries

   hatchet, but that's splitting hairs) and hacks him to death, stuffing

   psychotic trio, who are seen beating to death a man in a hotel room, 
   throwing another man out a window and terrorizing a woman at a

   dizzying hand-held camera work, bad two-note piano music and not 
   enough blood to qualify it as a must for gore hounds. Director

   concert is merely an outlet for him to launder his dirty money. Cliff 
   questions Taffy in Mr. Bianca's office, unaware that Mr. Bianca is 
   videotaping their conversation. Mr. Bianca views the tape and uses 
   the information taken from it to try and blackmail and rape Taffy, 
   but Rudy intervenes and punches-out Mr. Bianca. Taffy and Rudy try to 
   escape, buy Rudy is shot in the shoulder by Scarpo and Taffy takes 
   him to Jack to patch him up (Why in the hell would she do that after 
   what Cliff just told her? It makes no sense at all.). The film ends 
   at Vasquez Rocks, where every character in the film ends up, not 
   aware that Jack has the whole area mined and ready to explode. Be 
   prepared to be under whelmed.&nbsp; This is a slow-moving and rather 
   boring film that tries to perk-up viewer interest by including a sex 
   scene every fifteen minutes or so, but it looks to me that those sex 
   scenes were severely edited to achieve an R-Rating (an X-Rated 
   version of the film with hardcore sex scenes, titled <B>LOVE EXPLOSIONS</B>,
    was released to porno theaters), thereby ruining what small 
   pleasures the viewer could have taken from the film. The screenplay, 
   written by Avery and co-star P.A. Hedberg, is far too ambitious for 
   the film's meager budget, as the explosions are few and far between 
   (only four total), the acting poor and the dialogue is full of 
   flubbed and stepped-on lines. You can tell this film was made during 
   the early 70's (besides the obvious wardrobe and hairstyles) because 
   the film's sole gay character, Frankie Collins (Pepe Russo), is 
   portrayed as a lying thief who gets the crap beat out of him and 
   called &quot;faggot&quot; by Scarpo every chance he gets. This film 
   is so cheap that when a car explodes, it does so off-screen. The 
   finale is a total letdown, as the promised destruction of the rock 
   festival never materializes (we never see the festival at all!), just 
   a lame car chase and Jack accidentally blowing himself up 
   (unconvincingly) while trying to save Taffy. Avoid it at all costs. <B><A HREF="booby_trap_1970b.htm">BOOBY

   telling a story about his sister Judy and how she ran away and how 
   his mother never recovered. When the girls disregard his story, 
   Howard gets angry (&quot;I'm gonna do Mama a favor!&quot;) and rapes 
   and strangles the girls, dumping their bodies on deserted stretches 
   of the road. Howard's homelife is equally depressing: He lives with 
   his over-protective Mother (Dorothy Bennett) and spends his spare 
   time building model cars (it must be the glue!). It's not that Howard 
   kills every girl he picks up. If he can get them to say that they 
   love their mother, he lets them go. Police Captain Shaw (Russell 
   Johnson) hopes this is &quot;not some nut job like the Zodiak Killer, 
   the Las Vegas Strangler or that psycho from Houston&quot; as his 
   investigation into the strangulations leads nowhere. Captain Shaw 
   finally gets a break when Howard strangles a girl with a wire coat

   and strangles her, accidentally leaving his glasses at the murder 
   scene. The glasses, along with the wire coat hanger, lead Captain 
   Shaw closer to Howard. Meanwhile, Howard branches out and pick up a 
   homosexual man who is hitch hiking through town. After determining 
   that he also hates his mother, Howard kills him, wrapping a wire coat 
   hanger around his neck. Howard's boss, Mr. Baldwin (John Harmon),

   delivering and picking up dry cleaning doesn't improve, he will be 
   fired. Howard's world starts falling apart as his job (and his only 
   means of picking up hitch hikers) is in jeopardy and the police begin 
   closing in. Howard picks up an 11 year old runaway girl, then rapes 
   and kills her (thankfully offscreen). This proves to be Howard's 
   undoing as the police find a dry cleaning receipt clutched in her 
   dead hand. The police pick up Howard at the dry cleaners without 
   incident. We next see Howard clad in a straightjacket muttering to 
   himself, &quot;I'm so cold, Mama&quot;.&nbsp; This tight little

   Harry Novak's Boxoffice International Pictures. Though by no means a 
   bloody film, the sleaze factor is high as Robert Gribbin's 
   performance as Howard is a hoot. Playing Howard as slightly retarded, 
   he does evoke some sympathy, that is until he kills the little girl. 
   Then you hope he gets his just desserts. But, just as in real life, 
   things don't always happen the way you think they should. Irv's son

   head with two pounds of raw liver. Declared cured, Otto returns to 
   the butcher shop and his shrewish wife (Franca Polcelli), only to be 
   horrified about how high the price of sausages have become. He 
   immediately slashes the price and must find a way to come up with a

   rushes over to the butcher shop and saves his love in the nick of

   (an entire family killed by the snakes during dinner time; a plumber 
   has a snake crawl up his pant leg; a lady taking a bath gets attacked 
   by snakes crawling out of the drain) and our intrepid duo still 
   cannot figure out why the snakes are attacking in such a vicious 
   manner until they visit the local U.S. Army base and meet the 
   dastardly Colonel Stroud (Dan Priest). It seems the Colonel has been 
   dumping an experimental nerve gas, called CT3, in an abandoned mine 
   without authorization. The gas is leaking, causing the snakes to go 
   on a murderous hunting spree. Fearing a coverup, Tom and Ann 
   investigate the Colonel and the tight security at the base. When two 
   Army soldiers (one of them played by Darwin Joston of <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#AssaultPrecinct1376">ASSAULT

   drunk Army doctor (Ron Gold) bucks the Colonel's orders and helps Tom 
   and Ann. This leads them to the abandoned mine and the main den of 
   killer rattlesnakes. After they are attacked by the snakes in their 
   tent and Ann is bitten, Tom goes after the Colonel. The Colonel kills 
   the alcoholic doctor and goes to the mine to coverup his crimes. 
   After a brief shootout, the Colonel blows himself and the mine up 
   with a hand grenade, trapping the snakes and ending their assault. Or 
   does it? While this is not especially a bad film, the PG rating 
   severely hampers any suspense that can be had in a film of this type 
   and it looks as if director John McCauley (whose only other film as 
   director was <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Deadly Intruder">THE 
   DEADLY INTRUDER</A></B> - 1984) planned it that way. <B><A HREF="rattlers_1975b.htm">RATTLERS</A></B> 
   plays like a TV movie from that period and if it wasn't for the

   watching one (remember <B><A HREF="tarantulas_deadly_cargo.htm">TARANTULAS:
    THE DEADLY CARGO</A></B> - 1976?). What this film needed was more 
   blood and guts, as we are never shown the aftermath of the attacks, 
   just the repulsed reactions of the cast as the sheets are lifted at 
   the morgue. Still, this is a 70's PG rating, so they still show more 
   than the sanitized PG of today. I just wish there were more.

    - </B>I remember, as a horny teenager, seeing this film at a 
   drive-in in the mid-70's.&nbsp; My memories of this film were quite 
   fond and I was anxious to view it again when I saw that it was 
   available on DVD. Well, either my memory was playing tricks on me or 
   I was hornier as a teenager than I thought (who wasn't?). Quite 
   frankly, this film stinks. It is mainly a hodge-podge of near-X sex scenes<A HREF="scream_in_the_streets_1973_dvd.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/scream in the streets2.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="134" HEIGHT="190" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   bumpered by some inane and badly-choreographed police action. A 
   serial killer is knifing women at a local park. It is up to to local 
   cops, Ed and Bob (John Kirkpatric and Frank Bannon) to track this 
   psychopath down and arrest him. What they don't know is the killer is 
   dressing up as a woman and walking away from his crimes undetected. 
   It's quite obvious to the viewer that she's a he (it's quite 
   pathetic, actually), but everyone in the film is fooled. The two cops 
   must also deal with a peeping tom (who spies on two lesbians making 
   love); a sicko who beats up his masseuse with his belt and a gang of 
   thugs robbing a store. All of the action scenes (they are few and far 
   in between) are lazily shot and one car chase scene has to be seen to 
   be believed. The main selling point to this film are the sex scenes. 
   As I mentioned before, they are of the near-X quality (a Harry Novak 
   specialty), showcasing both male and female full frontal nudity with 
   a pre-disposed penchant for oral sex. I dare you not to laugh at the 
   peeping tom as he slobbers watching the lesbians go at it. I double 
   dare you not to laugh as one of the lesbians spots the peeping tom 
   and make a phone call to the police while the other lesbian continues 
   performing oral sex on her!! The biggest laugh of all comes from the 
   cross-dressing serial killer. As he is stabbing the women he screams, 
   &quot;I hate women! You're rotten! ROTTEN!&quot; If this synopsis 
   make you want to run out and rent or buy this thing, be forwarned: 
   It's boring as hell and seems twice as long than it really is.

   This sick, sadistic Danish production could never be made in 
   today&#146;s politically correct climate. It treats women like dirt, 
   contains brutal torture scenes and is definitely not for the faint of 
   heart. In other words, I loved it! Peter and Mary (Tony Eades &amp; 
   Anne Sparrow), a down on their luck couple, rent a cheap room on the 
   top floor of a converted nightclub run by the sadistic Lila Lash 
   (Clara Keller) and her deformed midget son Olaf (Torben, who is a 
   sight to behold). Lila and Olaf run a prostitution ring in the attic, 
   where kidnapped girls are kept in check with unhealthy doses of 
   heroin and nightly beatings. Mary notices a wide variety of faceless 
   men entering the attic at all hours of the <A HREF="sinful_dwarf_1972b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/sinful dwarf.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="262" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>day
    and night and becomes suspicious. When she tells Tony what she has 
   seen, he tells her to mind her own business because he is more 
   worried about finding a job than losing the only place they can 
   afford to stay. Lila and Olaf set their sights on adding Mary to 
   their stable but first must figure out a way to get Tony out of the 
   picture. Lila sets Tony up with a job in a toy shop run by a fat slob 
   named Santa Claus, which is actually a front for a heroin smuggling 
   ring. Santa sends Tony (who is unaware of the illegal activities) to 
   France, giving Lila and Olaf the chance to kidnap Mary. They leave a 
   note in the room in which Mary tells Tony that she is leaving him. 
   Meanwhile, Mary is chained naked in the attic, shot full of heroin 
   and vaginally penetrated with the handle of Olaf&#146;s cane. She is 
   then raped by one of Lila&#146;s customers. Tony returns from France 
   and finds the note. Feeling dejected, he goes back to the toy shop to 
   work off his worries. While working in the basement, he overhears 
   Santa and Olaf talking about the heroin and prostitute operations. 
   Remembering what Mary told him, Tony goes to the police and they bust 
   Santa Claus and raid Lila&#146;s house. Tony finds Mary and three 
   other naked girls in a hidden room in the attic. When he realizes 
   what has been done to Mary, he shoots Lila (with a gun given to him 
   by a cop!), killing her. Olaf jumps out of the attic window to avoid 
   police capture and dies from his wounds. This sleazy bit of 
   exploitation is really rough stuff. You can actually feel yourself 
   getting dirty as you are viewing it. The problem is that this is 
   well-made sleaze, which makes you all the more uncomfortable. When 
   Lila, who was once a nightclub performer before being scarred in a 
   fire, sings cabaret songs (with Olaf accompanying on the piano) for 
   her elderly drunk female friend, the scenes are intercut with the 
   captive girls being whipped, raped and going through withdrawal. 
   These scenes are effective and quite unnerving. The sex scenes are 
   near-pornographic, showing both male and female full frontal nudity 
   and simulated sex that nearly looks real (as a matter of fact, this 
   was actually shot as a hardcore porn film and was edited down to a 
   soft-X for theatrical play in most countries by Harry Novak and his 
   Boxoffice International Pictures). The real find in this film is 
   Torben, who, to the best of my knowledge, has never made another film 
   (He was actually a host of a Swedish TV kiddie show and made at least 
   one more porno film besides this one!). His many close-ups reveal 
   grotesque features which even the best makeup artists could not hope 
   to duplicate. He has a diabolical laugh that is goosebumb-inducing 
   and one gets the feeling that he is not acting when he relishes 
   injecting his captives with drugs, spying on Mary and Peter making 
   love and playing with his many wind-up toys (a motif throughout the 
   film). This is one truly frightening guy, regardless of his three 
   foot frame. In closing, let me say that you will sit spellbound while 
   viewing this film and hate yourself for watching it after it ends. 
   How many films can make that statement? If you are daring, this sick
