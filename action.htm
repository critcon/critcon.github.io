   (1980). Guilio Sacchi (Tomas Milian) is a monster of the human kind, 
   a petty criminal who decides to graduate to the big time by 
   kidnapping the daughter of a wealthy Italian businessman. (The 
   original title of this film was </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="kidnap_of_mary_lou_1974.htm">THE

   the guests (men included) to perform oral sex on them. The guests are 
   then tied up and hung from the ceiling as they watch in horror as 
   Guilio blows away the homeowner's 4 year old son. Guilio then turns 
   his machine gun on them, slaughtering the helpless victims. Walter 
   Grandi (Henry Silva), the police chief assigned to the case, follows 
   the trail of bodies left in Guilio's wake. Guilio may be demented, 
   but he is no fool. He never leaves any witnesses to convict him, and 
   when he collects the ransom, he kills Mary Lou and his cohorts. When 
   Grandi finally catches him, Guilio is released for lack of evidence. 
   Grandi, in desperation, decides to take the law in his own hands. As 
   in real life, there are no happy endings here. This violent, 
   mean-spirited actioner could have only been made by the Italians. It 
   is well made (though badly dubbed) and ugly to look at. It's chock 
   full of nudity and bullet hits. Good fodder for fans of the genre. I

    -</B> A Filipino action film starring Christopher Mitchum (<B><A HREF="#Final Score">FINAL

   (Mitchum), a former Green Beret, is attacked in his store by 
   drugged-out street gang, he shoots one of the gang members when he 
   tries to run over Mitchell with his car. In retaliation, the gang 
   invades Mitchell's house and rape his wife and kill his young son. 
   Mitchell, upon returning home and finding his son dead and his wife 
   bloody and bruised, calls the police (He says to the 911 operator, 
   &quot;They've killed my son and raped my wife and you want my phone 
   number?&quot;), not knowing that while he is on the phone his wife is 
   in the bathroom slitting her throat with a straight razor. Mitchell 
   goes on <A HREF="american_commandos_1985b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/american commandos vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="125" HEIGHT="226" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>the
    warpath and begins to systematically hunting down and murdering all 
   the members of the street gang (He even finds time to have a 
   flashback, where he adopts a Filippino baby and marries the woman 
   handling the adoption, which turn out to be his dead son and wife!). 
   He eventually gets caught by the police, but an Interpol agent named 
   Brady (Ken Metcalfe, who also co-wrote the screenplay) steps in and 
   offers Mitchell a deal: Reform his old Special Forces squad and wipe 
   out the Golden Triangle drug cartel (who are responsible for 
   supplying the majority of heroin to the world) and his record will be 
   wiped clean. Mitchell agrees and begins talking to all his former 
   squad members, including Kelly (John Phillip Law), Creeper (Willie 
   Williams) and Brutus (Robert Marius). The one former member Mitchell 
   can't get to rejoin is Somsak (Franco Guerrero of <B>ONE ARMED EXECUTIONER</B>)
    and it becomes very clear to the audience why: He is the kingpin of 
   the Golden Triangle. Somsak tries (unsuccessfully) on several 
   occasions to stop the assault from ever happening, but once the final 
   attack does happen, Somsak has one final ace up his sleeve. One of 
   Mitchell's squad members is on Somsak's payroll. It's a long and 
   bloody ride.&nbsp; This is great, mindless fun from beginning to end, 
   with plenty of bloody action and &quot;What the fuck?&quot; moments. 
   I'm still reeling from the adoption/marriage proposal flashback by 
   Mitchell (which seems way out of place in a film like this). Mitchell 
   also has a habit of saying, &quot;There's noting we can do for them 
   now. We've got to keep moving!&quot; after losing members of his 
   squad. I'm especially fond of the warbus Mitchell and his men (and 
   scantilly-clad women) created. It looks like one of those short buses 
   retarded kids take to school, tricked-out with steel armor and hidden 
   rocket launchers and machine guns. One scene shows Mitchum on a 
   custom motorcycle (which fits neatly in the warbus) destroying a 
   section of road behind them with rockets, forcing an enemy truck that 
   is following them to fall down a ravine and explode in a ball of fire 
   (note the one stuntman on the right falling down the ravine and tell 
   me he didn't end up seriously hurt!). A mistake in the mastering of 
   the tape repeats an entire reel of footage (where the scantilly-clad 
   women get machine-gunned while working on the warbus), which adds 
   five extra minutes to the running time. No matter, though. You'll be 
   too engrossed in the insane action, plentiful shootouts and bloody 
   deaths. There's also lots of female nudity in <B><A HREF="american_commandos_1985.htm">AMERICAN
    COMMANDOS</A></B> to keep your eyes busy, too. What more could you 
   possibly ask for? Both Christopher Mitchum and John Phillip Law are 
   stiff as boards acting-wise, but they more than acquit themselves 
   when they are beating the snot out of or gunning down the rest of the 
   cast (including Franco Guerrero, who wears a striking white nehru 
   jacket throughout most of the film). Bobby A. Suarez is fast becoming 
   one of my favorite directors to come out of the Philippines.

   Champion martial artist Kristie Lang (Sibel Birzag) catches the 
   murder of an American soldier in Manila with her camera and calls the 
   American Embassy to report what she saw. Before she can hand over the 
   film to Embassy representative Victor Winslow (Joseph Zucchero), she 
   is viciously slashed and stabbed to death by the same black-garbed 
   people who murdered the American soldier. Luckily, she passed the 
   film to a cabbie before she was killed, telling him to give it to a 
   stripper friend of hers named Sulu. Kirstie's sister, L.A. cop Kat 
   Lang (Cat Sassoon, who has the fattest lips this side of a spousal 
   abuse victim), travels to Manila to investigate her sister's death, 
   but it's strictly off the books. After losing her luggage and money

    he hooks her up with Kristie's trainer, Bayani (Roland Dantes), and 
   tournament promoter Mr. Carrion (Tony Carrion), who's not quite what 
   he seems to be. As Kat begins rising through the tournament ranks 
   (and making Alcatraz a hefty sum on side bets), she slowly makes 
   friends with fellow tournament fighter Lorda (Melissa Moore; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#OneManArmy">ONE
    MAN ARMY</A></B> - 1993), while Alcatraz gets closer to finding 
   Kirstie's stripper friend Sulu. Kat discovers Kristie and Lorda were 
   working undercover with the FBI to find out the identities of members 
   of the Black Brigade, a militant group that wants to destroy the 
   relationship between America and the Philippines. Kat gets into deep 
   trouble when Lorda is kidnapped by the Black Brigade and they put 
   Kat, along with visiting American Ambassador Franklin (Ken Metcalfe), 
   at the top of their hit list. When Victor Winslow blackmails Alcatraz 
   to keep Kat off the trail of the Black Brigade, Alcatraz finally gets 
   to bed Kat and decides that she's too good to deceive. He finds Sulu, 
   recovers the film and brings the proof to the American Embassy. Lorda 
   escapes her captors, helps Kat save Ambassador Franklin's life and 
   brings down the Black Brigade. The Philippines is safe once again for 
   Americans, but please use caution when drinking the water.&nbsp; This 
   is director/producer Cirio H. Santiago's third time to the well 
   telling the same story, starting with <B><A HREF="#TNT Jackson">TNT JACKSON</A></B> 
   in 1975 and <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#Firecracker1981">FIRECRACKER</A></B> 
   in 1981. The problem here is, Cat Sassoon (<B><A HREF="dance_with_death_1991.htm">DANCE
    WITH DEATH</A></B> - 1991) is a terrible actress, although she has 
   the best tits money can buy, not to mention plenty of nude scenes, 
   including a topless fight in a bedroom that copies both <B>TNT</B> 
   and <B>FIRECRACKER</B>. Cat, who was the daughter of hair care 
   specialist Vidal Sassoon and sister of director Oley Sassoon (<B><A HREF="bloodfist_series_dvd.htm">BLOODFIST
    III: FORCED TO FIGHT</A></B> - 1993), died at age 32 of a heart 
   attack (drugs were suspected but never confirmed) while attending a 
   New Year's party to ring in 2002. <B><A HREF="angel_fist_1992c.htm">ANGELFIST</A></B> 
   is not a very good film (the martial arts fights are clunky and 
   badly-staged), but Santiago offers a ton of nudity (both Sassoon and 
   Melissa Moore disrobe as much as possible and there are more communal 
   shower scenes here than in most WIP films) and some truly demented 
   sequences, such as when Black Brigade leader Cirio Quirino (Santiago 
   regular Henry Strzalkowski) tortures Lorda in an icehouse by 
   stripping off her blouse and pressing her naked breasts on a block of 
   ice! This short, 80-minute film is light on blood and gore (just a 
   few stabbings in the beginning)<B>,</B> has no gunfights and nothing 
   explodes. One gets the feeling that Santiago was on cruise control 
   here and was taking a break from his usual shoot-em-up actioners, but 
   the sad fact was that Santiago would go on to direct a few of these 
   modern-day martial arts flicks and would not go back to his mindless 
   gunplay flicks. Too bad, because he was quite good at 'em. This is a 
   lesser, latter-day entry from Santiago that can be avoided unless you 
   like lots of nudity (Sassoon is well-oiled in all her full-frontal 
   shots) and the sight of lips that can best be described as 
   &quot;distracting&quot;. Also starring Denise Buick, Jessica Roberts, 
   Christina Portugal, Jim Moss, Bob Larson, Sheila Lintan, Ramon

   disco songs, dancing, women in skimpy outfits and a guest star roster 
   that includes Peter Lawford, Jim Backus, Alan Hale, Neville Brand, 
   Pat Buttram and Arthur Godfrey as himself? How can you possibly go 
   wrong? With Greydon Clark directing, producing and co-scripting (with 
   Alvin L. Fast), it's quite easy, actually. When Las Vegas lounge 
   singer Michelle Wilson (Susan Kiger) learrn from her manager, Manny 
   (Hale), that her younger brother Bobby was beaten-up and hospitalized 
   trying to steal drugs from kingpin Mike Farrell (Palance), she and 
   friend April (Jacqulin Cole) form a squad of all-female vigilantes to 
   destroy Farrell and his drug business. Each woman is an expert in 
   their field. Terry Grant (Sylvia Anderson) is a black movie 
   stuntwoman and expert driver. Kako Umaro (Lieu Chinh) is a black belt 
   martial artist. Maria (Noela Velasco) is a beautiful model, whose 
   looks will be used as a distraction to the bad guys. Elaine Brenner 
   (Robin Greer) is a policewoman, who is secretly working with her 
   boss, Captain Miller (Brand), to infiltrate the women's group and use 
   the information to bust Farrell before the women get him. After 
   stealing a van from a horny used car dealer (Buttram) and tricking it 
   out with rocket launchers and other goodies, the women then steal a 
   shitload of guns and ammunition from an even hornier gunrunner 
   (Backus) and his comical crew of nimcompoops (one who looks and acts

    Hardy!). The ladies kidnap Farrell's #1 street dealer, Sticks (Darby 
   Hinton), and hang him upside down while Kako beats him about the 
   nutsac with a metal pipe until he gives up the location of the latest 
   drug drop. They steal the drugs and Elaine and the girls bring it to 
   Captain Miller who, at first, is pissed at Elaine for spilling the 
   beans to the girls, but soon sees the advantages of having non-police 
   personnel doing his dirty work for him. The girls attack and destroy 
   Farrell's drug processing plant but, in the fracas, Farrell kidnaps 
   April and brings her to his boss, Mr. Burke's (Lawford) house, where 
   they torture her in his swimming pool. The girls rescue her in the 
   nick of time in a hail of bullets, some swordplay and a motorcycle 
   stunt. Farrell is attacked and killed by a pack of dogs (!) and Burke 
   is shot and drowns in his own pool. Hooray for women power!&nbsp; The 
   main problem with this film is that it's played like a broad comedy, 
   but it's not funny at all. Director Greydon Clark (<B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Bad Bunch">THE

   since there's no one named &quot;Angel&quot; in this film? Oh, well, 
   I'm nitpicking.) contains none of those, as it is a PG-rated 
   family-friendly mess. Whenever someone is punched or hit over the 
   head, cartoon sound effects are heard, like birds chirping or a 
   &quot;boiiinggg!&quot; sound. This is the type of film where instead 
   of killing Sticks after beating the info out of him, the girls set 
   him free after he promises to go straight! Nevermind that he hooked 
   Michelle's young brother on drugs or is known as the city's biggest 
   street pusher, the girls take him at his word and send him on his 
   way. In all fairness, he dies a short time later when he falls off a 
   tenement roof trying to escape from Farrell. The music soundtrack is 
   a second-rate knock-off of the <B>CHARLIE'S ANGELS</B> theme and the 
   action scenes look like they were filmed on the first take, as they 
   have that rough, badly-staged feel. Some of the women look very 
   uncomfortable holding and firing weapons (it's apparent Clark just 
   handed them weapons and yelled out &quot;Fire!&quot; without any 
   practice beforehand) and, while there are some decent stunts and 
   explosions during the attack on the processing plant, it all looks 
   rather rushed. The film does have some camp value thanks to the 
   eclectic cast of has-beens and fringe stars, but both Jack Palance 
   and Peter Lawford look like they would rather be any place besides 
   here. The women do look good in bikinis and tight fitting jumpsuits, 
   but when we watch films like this, we want to see what's underneath 
   those outfits. <B>ANGEL'S BRIGADE</B> is nothing but an inoffensive 
   theatrical film that could play on TV with no edits. What's the 
   point? Also starring Liza Greer as Trish, the underage would-be 
   member of the female gang who saves all their lives in the finale. 
   Director Clark cameos as a (what else?) movie director and Arthur 
   Godfrey cameos as himself, who the audience at Michelle's Vegas act

   This is one of those action films where a Vietnam vet comes home only 
   to find out his home town is being terrorized by (choose one or 
   mix-and-match): 1) A Street Gang; 2) A Motorcycle Gang; 3) Organized 
   Crime; 4) Drug Dealers. Joe Nace (Dennis Redfield) returns from the 
   war in a wheelchair and works at his father's grocery store. A 
   vicious street gang, led by Roy Boy (Paul Koslo), comes into the 
   store demanding protection money and, when Joe refuses, they kill a 
   female customer with a knife to her stomach (after ripping her blouse 
   off) and beat Joe over the head repeatedly with a meat hammer, 
   tenderizing his skull and killing him. Joe's squad leader, Bill <A HREF="annihilators_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/annihilators vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="126" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(Christopher
    Stone), comes for the funeral and stays after hearing the pleas of 
   help from Joe's father (Sid Conrad). After calling Popeye, his 
   mysterious and unseen superior, Bill gets his old squad together to 
   teach the townspeople how to defend themselves and to kick some gang 
   ass. Everything goes well at first, as the townspeople begin fighting 
   back and reclaim their town. Lt. Hawkins (Jim Antonio) is not too 
   pleased that the squad is in his town practicing vigilante justice, 
   but the police commishioner (Bruce Taylor) is pleased with the 
   results and tells Hawkins to lay off. During a shootout in the middle 
   of town, one of the squad members, Ray (Gerrit Graham), is shot in 
   the back protecting a small child and is killed. Bill discovers that 
   the gang is merely a front for a bigger drug running operation and, 
   when the squad intercepts one of the drug shipments, the shit hits 
   the fan. The shipment turns out to be millions of dollars worth of 
   heroin and Roy Boy (armed with a flame thrower) calls in backup of 
   his own and holds the entire town hostage until he gets his drugs 
   back. Bill, Garrett (Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs) and Woody (Andy Wood), 
   along with the entire town, band together to fight the gang. Things 
   go bad when Roy Boy hijacks a schoolbus full of kids. In a surprising 
   turn of events, the kids disarm the hijackers (one kid jams a pencil 
   into one of the gang member's neck) and Bill has a final fight with 
   Roy Boy on the roof of a building. It is then we learn the identity 
   of the mysterious Popeye and how he was secretly helping the squad 
   all along. This is standard 80's action fare elevated slightly by a 
   few well-executed setpieces and some extreme bits of violence.

   making her the sixth member of the ragtag squad. On their way to the

   full of German soldiers and destroy a German airfield, so supplies 
   can be dropped by plane without any interference (both the train 
   explosion and the airfield massacre are footage from other films). 
   During the airfield destruction, Doctor is shot in the stomach by a 
   German soldier and Mirka says she cannot remove the bullet because it 
   is lodged too deep in him, he needs to be taken to a hospital 
   immediately. Doctor says no, he is needed for this mission to succeed

    Not only is this film cheap beyond belief, it is also horrendously 
   acted, not helped by the people who dubbed it into English, including 
   Edward Mannix and Ted Rusoff, two of the greats in the dubbing field, 
   who were probably more bored than I was watching this no-budget mess 
   and put zero effort in dubbing their characters. Especially 
   flabbergasting is Paul Muller (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LadyFrankenstein">LADY
    FRANKENSTEIN</A></B> - 1971) as the General who created this squad 
   and gives them their mission. Whenever Mister radios-in to tell the 
   General their progress, he belittles the squad, calling them &quot;fat
    heads&quot; and other put-downs.&nbsp; If I were a member of the 
   squad, I would save a bullet in my pistol and the next time I saw him 
   I would put that bullet right between his eyes. But the General is 
   not the only problematic character in the film. Check out Priest's 
   response when he watches the train explode. It looks like he is 
   having a spastic fit, quite unbecoming from a former man of the 
   cloth. And don't get me started on Mirka, either. She begins the film 
   as a frightened nurse, but at the end of the film, she's a 
   full-fledged freedom fighter, deadly with both her hands and her body 
   and even deadlier with a machinegun, all within the span of two days! 
   There's not one thing in this film that is remotely interesting and 
   that is because director/screenwriter &quot;John J. Dawson&quot; is 
   actually Leandro Lucchetti, the man who also gave us the execrable <B><A HREF="bloody_psycho_1989.htm">BLOODY
    PSYCHO</A></B> (1989) and <B><A HREF="caged_women_1991.htm">CAGED WOMEN</A></B> 
   (1991). It is highly obvious he put no effort into this film, as 85% 
   of the action scenes are footage from other films and all the actors 
   do is &quot;react&quot; to something they aren't even seeing. The 
   fight in the cave at the film's finale seems to be the only original 
   action footage in the film and it is nothing to write home about. 
   When people are shot, there are precious few bloody bullet squibs, as 
   the majority of gunshot victims grab their chest and fall to the 
   ground. Even the music score, by the late Stelvio Cipriani (who I 
   happen to admire), sounds like warmed-over themes from better war 
   action films. I have seen my share of lousy Italian war actioners, 
   but this one sits on the lower rung of the ladder for this genre. 
   It's not even worth an unintentional laugh, so why bother? I have to 
   watch these things, but you don't have to, so heed my warnings and 
   watch something else.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   When a platoon of American soldiers are ambushed on the side of the 
   road by a group of young Vietnamese school children (one little tot 
   threatens the soldiers with a hand grenade!), Captain Rosenblatt 
   (Corwyn Paul Sperry) orders his men to slaughter an entire village of 
   Vietnamese men, women and children when they do not tell him the 
   whereabouts of the person in charge of the ambush, who disappeared in 
   the maze of underground tunnels located underneath the jungle. 
   Rosenblatt trains a squad of soldiers to become &quot;tunnel 
   rats&quot;, a special force designed to crawl through the tunnels and 
   kill the enemy. In charge of the squad is Sgt. Bruce Burns (Jack 
   Gilbert) and it is his duty to lead his men into the tunnels and 
   capture or kill Commander Von Dram (Louie Katana), who is responsible 
   for most of the <A HREF="battle_rats_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/battle rats british vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ambushes
    in the area. After a short period of time, where we are introduced 
   to the members of the squad (which also includes a prerequisite bar 
   fight just before shipping off), our tunnel rats get down to 
   business. They enter the first tunnel, where they are attacked by 
   snakes, dismantle some wired boobytraps, are attacked by bats and one 
   squad member is captured and tortured by Von Dram (The soldier says 
   to him, &quot;Fuck you, you slimy goddamned stinking gook!&quot;, 
   just before Von Dram pokes his eyes out with his fingers!). Sgt. 
   Burns begins a love affair with VC girl Nama (Mylene Nocum), not 
   knowing that she is a spy for Von Dram. The tunnel rats then raid 
   another village and find another tunnel, which results in the death 
   of some members due to spiked boobytraps, a snake pit and VC ambushes 
   (the rest of the squad members get Purple Hearts, even though they 
   weren't injured!). Sgt. Burns stupidly tells his new gook girlfriend 
   that he and his men will be raiding another tunnel in the morning, 
   so, you guessed it, Von Dram and his men are waiting in ambush. 
   Captain Rosenblatt shoots Von Dram multiple times at close range 
   (while comically repeating, &quot;Fuck you, old man!&quot; over and 
   over), but Von Dram is wearing a bulletproof vest and stabs the 
   Captain several times. Sgt. Burns and his skeleton crew must then 
   blow up the tunnel (it's the VC's main communications base) before 
   they are killed and Von Dram escapes. While the acting in <B>BATTLE RATS</B> 
   is some of the worst and stiffest I have seen in recent memory (I was 
   howling with laughter throughout the entire film), the violence is so 
   over-the-top, it makes watching this almost seem like you are having 
   a fever dream. This Philippines-lensed action film, directed by 
   Benjamin Bridges (using his &quot;Briggs Benjamin Sr.&quot; 
   pseudonym), is full of so much bloody imagery, the acting can be 
   forgiven. People (including women and children) are shot in the head, 
   stabbed, impaled or blown apart. The eye-gouging scene is (pardon the 
   pun) an eye-opener as are most of the tunnel scenes where the VC 
   pop-out of their hidden trap doors in the floors, walls and ceilings 
   and silently slice up the cast with their knives. The subplot 
   involving Sgt. Burns falling in love with Nama is the only real 
   negative part of the film, as the action stops dead in it's tracks 
   while these two non-actors try to convince us they are in love. They 
   fail miserably. The finale, which finds Sgt. Burns facing Nama and 
   Von Dram in the tunnels is one of the most pathetic pieces of acting 
   you will ever see. It is only saved when he happens upon Captain 
   Rosenblatt, who is hanging by his arms with his eyes dangling out of 
   their sockets, as he pleads over and over to Burns, &quot;Shoot 
   me!&quot; (which he finally does). But hey, the bodycount is high, 
   the deaths bloody and the action fast-paced. What more could you 
   want? When it comes to Grade B action films, nothing comes close to 
   the ones made in the Philippines and Indonesia. Why? Because there 
   are no rules or taboos that they aren't willing to break. Also 
   starring Tony Lao, Paul John, Albert Dominguez, David Giberson, Eric 
   Hann and Chris Castilleios. Never legally available on home video in 
   the U.S., the print I viewed came from a surprisingly good dub of a Greek-subtitled

   (Barbara Hooper). Meanwhile, Sam is assigned to escort an important 
   enemy General back to base camp. The General has switched sides and 
   is willing to turn over a secret codebook to the Americans that 
   contains the names of American double agents. Dimitri has other 
   plans, though, and ambushes Sam's squad, taking Sam and the General 
   prisoner and killing everyone else. After getting a little nookie 
   from Terry, Lt. Ransom heads out to rescue Sam and the General, aided 
   by Captain Dupre (Lydie Denier) and her squad of French resistance 
   fighters, as well as Jacobs and Keller, who have a score to settle 
   with Dimitri. They all manage to save the General and kill Dimitri 
   (unfortunately, Sam is long-dead, hanging upside down from a tree and 
   being eaten by rats). Keller even finds the time to romance Capt. 
   Dupre, but when Ransom gets back to headquarters and the codebook is 
   deciphered, he discovers that someone close to him is a traitor, 
   which forces him to seek justice through the barrel of a gun. I 
   didn't see that coming.&nbsp; This is the second of Filipino director 
   Cirio H. Santiago's Vietnam War action flicks that he made in the 
   80's. Robert Patrick reprises the same role he portrayed in 
   Santiago's first Nam film, <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#EyeOfTheEagle">EYE
    OF THE EAGLE</A></B> (1987), only this time it's a starring role 
   rather than a secondary character, as he was in <B>EYE</B>. Patrick, 
   who got his start in other Santiago-directed films like <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Equalizer2000">EQUALIZER
    2000</A></B> and <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Future Hunters">FUTURE
    HUNTERS</A></B> (both 1986), still comes off as too over-animated, 
   yelling out his lines rather than speaking them. It would take him a 
   few more years to find his acting groove (his breakout role in <B><A HREF="terminator_2_judgement_day_1991.htm">TERMINATOR
    2</A></B> [1991] was basically a non-speaking role) and he would 
   also make his mark on TV in such series as <B><A HREF="x_files_tv_1993_2002.htm">THE
    X-FILES</A></B> [1993 - 2002] and <B><A HREF="unit_tv_series.htm">THE
    UNIT</A></B> [2006 - 2009]. Santiago offers his usual cornucopia of 
   action set-pieces, including lots of gunfights, explosions and bloody 
   bullet squibs. There are also some brief nude scenes, a smattering of 
   gore (shots to the head; Sam being eaten by rats) and a good 
   helicopter explosion (this one isn't a model). Frequent Santiago 
   collaborator Joe Mari Avellana's script is nothing special, but the 
   acting by a cast of Santiago regulars makes it all bearable. The 
   stinger at the end was also a nice touch and totally unexpected. My 
   appreciation of Santiago as a director increases every time I watch 
   another film of his. The majority of his films may be nothing more 
   than rip-offs of other movies, but he is a professional and is 
   capable of turning out compact (the majority of his films run 85 
   minutes or less), entertaining time-wasters. Also known as <B><A HREF="killer_instinct_1987.htm">KILLER

   just acts like himself and beats up all the white people he can get 
   his hands on. His fight with Bruce Glover is one of this film's 
   highlights, even if it's obvious Glover is being doubled in some of 
   the more strenuous stunts. Some may find that this film is too slow, 
   but there's a lot to enjoy here, from the black cop who can't stand

   level-headed of the two!); the bullet squibs that gush blood in the 
   gunfight scenes; to the blood-soaked shootout finale in the

   before the powers-that-be decided to add the word &quot;Black&quot; 
   to the title for its VHS release in 1985. While the new title is not 
   misleading, one still has to wonder why it was necessary to change 
   it. Three black terrorists sneak onto the shores of South West Africa 
   and end up at a remote farmhouse, where they take Anna (Vera Johns), 
   her mother (Bess Finney), father (Willem Labuschagne) and younger 
   brother Peter (Norman Knox) hostage. The terrorists shoot the father 
   in the back when he tries to escape, killing him, and abuse the 
   mother, turning her into their personal slave (they seem <A HREF="black_terrorist_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/black terrorist vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>to

   eventually killing her when they are done. The mother causes a 
   diversion (which ends in her getting her throat cut with a butcher 
   knife), allowing Anna to escape by foot into the desolate landscape. 
   She is able to make it to the shack of drunkard Jock (screenwriter 
   Howard Connell) and they both decide to head back to the farm to get 
   some payback, but their truck breaks down and they are picked-up by 
   American journalist Brad (Robert Aberdeen), who drives them to a gas 
   station. Joe (Allan Granville), the owner of the gas station, joins 
   the trio as they head towards the farm, unaware that two of the 
   terrorists have stolen Anna's Jeep and have left the farm, taking 
   Peter along with them as a hostage. When they get to the farm, the 
   third terrorist riddles Jock with automatic gunfire before Joe kills 
   him with his machine gun. Anna, Joe and Brad then set out to save 
   Peter, who is now traversing the desert by foot with the other two 
   terrorists after the Jeep breaks down. A series of events finds Peter 
   and the last surviving terrorist holed-up in an abandoned building, 
   while gung-ho Joe, pacifist Brad and worried Anna try to figure out 
   how to save Peter. It all ends with Joe dead, Peter escaping and the 
   last terrorist limping back to his boat and heading back to his 
   homeland, laughing like a hyena and proud of all the death and 
   destruction he and his dead comrades have caused. Bad sound recording 
   aside (the dialogue was recorded live and sounds muzzled, making much 
   of what is being said unintelligible, especially with the thick local 
   accents), <B>BLACK TERRORIST</B> still manages to entertain thanks to 
   some great on-location cinematography and sudden bursts of bloody 
   violence. Director/producer Neil Hetherington (his only directorial 
   effort) uses the desolate locations to good effect, although the 
   script by co-star Howard Connell is full of so many lucky 
   coincidences, the film becomes some sort of surreal actioner that 
   defies logic. While the three terrorist seem to have been sent to 
   this farm to &quot;free&quot; their homeland (How they planned on 
   doing this is never explained), they are really nothing but 
   rape-happy thugs who get-off on inflicting violence and degradation 
   to their captives and soon they turn on each other, as the injured 
   terrorist is left at the farm by the other two because he will slow 
   them down and the surviving terrorist shoots the second terrorist 
   when he tries to stop him from raping a female whose automobile they 
   have just carjacked. The paper-thin plot is really only an excuse to 
   show the terrorists killing their hostages, usually by shooting them 
   (lots of bloody bullet squibs). I'm sure this film has some major 
   political subtext in its home country, but it plays like a bloody 
   torture session in most other countries. Clocking-in at a shade less 
   than 72 minutes, <B>BLACK TERRORIST</B> doesn't overstay its welcome 
   and would make a good companion piece with the similarly-themed <B><A HREF="albino_1976.htm">ALBINO</A></B>

   off the buck (it triggers a flashback to when Tiger was a cop). They

    who uses them as ingrediants for expensive Chinese medical cures.

   river, a rickety old suspension bridge and other forest dangers in 
   order to avoid a large posse of hicks who are now after them. Tiger 
   and Connie make it home, but instead of grabbing the Blastfighter, 
   Tiger makes some Molotov cocktails, thinning out the posse by setting

    Connie is shot in the leg by Wally, forcing Tiger to remove the 
   bullet with his knife (he succeeds). He then has to pull her leg bone 
   apart (which is jutting out of the wound) so he can apply a splint 
   (all of this is shown in close-up). Tom is overhead in a helicopter 
   trying to spot them. When he does, he tells Wally to remain where he 
   is and then tries to talk some sense to Tiger, telling him if he 
   forgets everything that has happened, he will let them go free. Wally 
   doesn't like this deal, so when Tiger and Connie come out of hiding 
   to talk to Tom, Wally shoots Connie dead and Tiger goes all Rambo on 
   their asses. He picks off half the posse just with his knife and a 
   rifle (he shoots Wally in the leg&nbsp; while he is in the 
   helicopter), but the major carnage comes when Jake arrives home and 
   pulls out the Blastfighter. He uses the weapon to destroy the 
   hillbilly's vehicles, takes the arm off one hillbilly and then blows 
   one hick apart until he is nothing but a bloody spray (a nice gory 
   body explosion). He then shoots the arm off another hillbilly

   destroying the Blastfighter by slamming it against the tree. He 
   should have waited because he still has to deal with Tom. They agree 
   to face each other with only one bullet in each of their weapons of 
   choice (a shotgun for Tom and a pistol for Tiger). Of course, Tom 
   being the bad guy, he cheats, but instead of killing him, Tiger

    While nothing special, this film is enjoyable due to the frequent

   final 20 minutes of the film, it is a hoot to hear the dubbing 
   artists use exaggerated Southern drawls for the characters they are 
   dubbing (just like the dubbing in most Italian films, they have no 
   idea how any American talks!). The on-location photography also <A HREF="blastfighter_1984b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blastfighter spanish dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="307" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>adds

   the making of this film. All the shots of real-life animal deaths 
   (including the buck and a pig) were taken from stock documentary

   great shape) while wearing his banana suit (he doesn't want anyone to

   does get a mention in the film, it is quickly dropped. Bava also says 
   that he spoke English when he made this film, but in the past years,

   vows revenge, but when Tracy finds the gold medallion and 
   (eventually) gives it to Steve, he recognizes it as a gold medal to a 
   local kickboxing event (What are the chances?). Meanwhile, George 
   notices that his medallion is missing, so he and Frank sneak into 
   Diane &amp; Edward's house looking for it, only to run into a police 
   detective, whom they kill by bashing his head against the side of the 
   pool after yet another martial arts fight. Tracy begs Steve to turn 
   over the medallion to the police, but he refuses and vows to kill all 
   those responsible for his parents' deaths. Things get complicated 
   when Steve beats the snot out of George's son, Bruce, and when George 
   goes to challenge Steve at his gym (where still yet another martial 
   arts fight breaks out), he notices that Steve is wearing his 
   medallion around his neck.&nbsp; Steve finally relents to Tracy's 
   constant requests and gives the medallion to Tracy's father (who also 
   happens to be Steve's trainer) to turn over to the police, but before 
   he can do so he is attacked by James and the gang (who get the 
   medallion back) and Tracy's father ends up in the hospital in 
   critical condition, where he eventually dies. That turns out to be 
   the straw that broke the camel's back, as Steve goes on a bloody 
   revenge spree (he impersonates a sports writer to get James' 
   address), first killing Frank (by blowtorch) and then nearly getting 
   killed himself when the other three gang-up on him in a MetroRail 
   train car. After the usual 80's style training montage, Steve is 
   ready to send James, Walter and George's souls to Hell when they 
   kidnap Tracy. This Philippines-lensed martial arts actioner, directed 
   by the late Teddy Page (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Fireback1983">FIREBACK</A></B>

   and written by Rod Davis for producer K.Y. Lim's Silver Star Film 
   Corporation production outfit, suffers from a case of &quot;bad 
   acting-itis&quot;, as well as having the music and sound effects 
   cranked so loud, sometimes you can't hear the dialogue. That's just 
   as well, though, because whatever words you can make out are idiotic 
   and unbelievable (I have never heard anyone, even the drunkest of 
   people, say some of the stuff you will hear in this film!). This is 
   not one of Page's best films (it's apparent his budget was much lower 
   than most of his 80's films), as it is a cheap collection of martial 
   arts and action sequences with the thinnest of revenge plots to hold 
   it together. While it is nice to see Ned (spelled &quot;Nead&quot; in 
   the credits) Hourani, James Gaines, Jim Moss and Jerry Beyer get 
   prominent roles for a change (they were basically secondary or 
   background characters in most other films), it's a shame it has to be 
   in a film that is this poor. While there are plentiful well-staged 
   martial arts fights and stunts (One ends with Steve tying Walter to 
   the railroad tracks and the MetroRail runs him over [offscreen]), 
   they are ruined by the over-amped sound effects and music tracks, not 
   to mention the laughable acting talents of Sean Donahue and Christine 
   Landson, who both seem to be reading their dialogue off of cue cards.

    We are then transported to New York City in 1986. Steel suffers from 
   PTSD and is now a drunk and his wife (actress unknown) bails him out 
   of jail for destroying a bar. She tells him she is taking him to see 
   a psychiatrist at the Veterans Administration Hospital, because he 
   can no longer live like this, he needs professional help. She tells 
   Steel that it has been over ten years and everyone has forgotten 
   about Vietnam. &quot;I haven't&quot;, says Steel, but his wife tells 
   him he has to fight a different war now, &quot;for your family, 
   money, for your job. If you don't look out, you'll lose this war, 
   too.&quot; She reminds him that he has a young son that he needs to 
   set an example for, asking Steel if he remembers him. &quot;Do 
   you?&quot; shoots back Steel, as he gets out of the taxi his wife 
   drives to support her family and then walks to the Veterans 
   Administration Hospital. Later, his wife watches a televised news 
   report, as the newscaster describes a hijacking and a hostage 
   situation in some unnamed Third World nation. The newscaster reads 
   the names of the military personnel that are being held hostage and 
   one of the names is &quot;Daniel Danneo&quot;, which she instantly 
   recognizes as Steel's friend Danny, the one who is causing her 
   husband's mental breakdown. Steel believed he was dead, which caused 
   him to become a drunk. His wife knows that if Steel hears this name, 
   he will try to rescue Danny and the rest of the hostages from the 
   hijackers. A man named Hoskins (actor unknown) rings the doorbell and 
   tells Steel's wife that he is from the &quot;Acme Agency&quot; and is 
   there to evaluate the house for a mortgage. She tells him to leave, 
   realizing her husband has taken a second mortgage on the house to 
   finance his trip to rescue Danny. When Hoskins leaves, she calls 
   Major Briggs (Martin Balsam; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Blood&amp;Diamonds1977">BLOOD
    AND DIAMONDS</A></B> - 1977), telling him that Steel took a loan out 
   on the house to finance a rescue mission, because he felt so guilty 
   all these years. She begs Major Briggs to tell Steel where the 
   hostages are being held, this is just what he needs to break out of 
   his funk. Briggs says he will do what he can, but she tells him to 
   hurry up, Steel has disappeared and she has no idea where he is.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Steel turns up at the house of Richard Benson (Peter Hooten; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#T2020TexasGladiator">2020
    TEXAS GLADIATORS</A></B> - 1982), an old Army buddy of his who was 
   there when Danny was taken prisoner by the Cong in 1974. Richard 
   knows why Steel is there, he wants him to help rescue Danny, even 
   though Richard's wife (actress unknown) tells him not to. Richard 
   tells her he is not going to abandon Danny again, because he, too, 
   like Steel, has nightmares nearly every night and she knows how bad 
   they are. &quot;I don't want you to abandon us. Isn't it bad enough 
   our son has leukemia? I want you here!&quot; says Richard's wife. 
   Steel overhears the conversation, talks to the young son and then 
   goes to leave Richard's house when Richard appears and says, 
   &quot;Okay, let's go get Danny!&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Steel and Richard have a few stops to make before rescuing Danny, 
   namely to put their old squad back together. Their first stop is 
   Miami, where they try to convince squad member Mark Bright (Nat Kelly 
   Cole) to get some weapons together and join them on the hostage 
   rescue. It takes some convincing because Mark is a casino owner who 
   owes a ton of money to the Mob, so Steel and Richard rough up some 
   mob members out to kill Mark and he joins his old pals in their 
   mission. The next stop is some unnamed African nation, where former 
   squad member Travis Mills (Werner Pochath; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#TerrorExpress1979">TERROR
    EXPRESS</A></B> - 1979) works at the Safari Disco as a female 
   impersonator (!), talk/singing a love ballad to an appreciative 
   audience (Pochath looks ridiculous in his female getup, his hairy 
   chest a dead giveaway that he is not a woman!). Travis is not happy 
   to see them (and by the look on their faces, he can see that they 
   don't approve of what he is doing!) and tells them that he is a 
   prisoner in this country, thanks to its ruler, General Ortega 
   (Franklin Dominguez; <B><A HREF="#Raiders Magic Ivory">RAIDERS OF THE

   monthly military pension and makes him have gay sex with him! The

   steal his cache of automatic weapons and his helicopter (Steel shoots

    Major Briggs takes a trip to the unnamed Third World country (filmed 
   in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic) where Danny and four other 
   military POWs are being held hostage, warning members of the 
   government that four Americans are heading here to rescue the 
   hostages. He tells them if this renegade squadron of former soldiers 
   is not successful in their task, they can kill them with no reprisals 
   from the United States. Major Briggs then tells them if Steel and his 
   men are successful in rescuing the hostages, he will kill them 
   himself as they leave the country. Major Briggs keeps a close eye on 
   Steel and his squad's progress, but is he really willing to kill them 
   or is he paying lip service to this country's government? The squad 
   of four discovers that the hostages are being held in an abandoned 
   sugar factory, so they stake it out and come up with a plan of 
   action. Will they rescue the hostages and, more importantly, will any 
   of them survive if they do?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   - 1972), layers the film with enough weird sights to keep your brain 
   and eyes occupied before the final firefight begins. I have to say 
   that I have seen Werner Pochath play more than his share of crazy 
   characters (such as in <B><A HREF="laser_mission_1989.htm">LASER MISSION</A></B> 
   - 1989), enough of them for him to become one of my favorite Italian 
   genre film actors (I first noticed him in the horrid <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#IguanaTongueFire71">IGUANA
    WITH THE TONGUE OF FIRE</A></B> - 1971), but seeing him in women's 
   clothes and talk/singing a love ballad really sent me for a loop! He 
   is the best thing about this film, as he always makes any film he 
   appears in seem better than it actually is. Pochath died at the 
   relatively young age of 53 in 1993 after getting cirrhosis of the 
   liver while receiving treatment for AIDS. Speaking of AIDS, this was 
   Nat Kelly Cole's only film role. He was the adopted son of singers 
   Nat King Cole and Maria Cole. His sister was popular singer Natalie 
   Cole and he died from complication of AIDS in 1995 (Is there a 
   connection? I'll let you debate that.). This film also has its fair 
   share of surprises and there's one about Danny that I didn't see 
   coming. If I told you what it was, I would ruin the film for you. It 
   should also be noted that everyone in this film is dubbed (even 
   though it is plain to see everyone is speaking English), so it's 
   weird hearing different voices coming out of Bo Svenson and Martin 
   Balsam's mouths since they both have distinctive speech patterns. 
   Still, this film delivers what it promises, so you should have a good 
   time with it.&nbsp; The film ends with an off-screen narrator telling 
   us the future of the surviving characters. You won't believe your 
   ears when he tells us what happened to Travis. I guess being gay has 
   tragic consequences, especially in Italian genre films! Richard's 
   future also isn't too rosy (His son died of leukemia while he was 
   rescuing Danny, so he adopted a female Vietnamese child! What?!?).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    hand man Mario (Mike Moroff; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#ReturnLivingDead3">RETURN
    OF THE LIVING DEAD 3</A></B> - 1993), who is almost as much as a 
   mental defective as Billy, offer Scott and Billy a chance to make 
   some money, but Scott turns them down. Since Tony also owes crime 
   kingpin Mr. Costello (Al Ruscio) $75,000, he hires Diablo and his 
   gang to burn down Scott's bar (with orders not to harm anyone), in 
   hopes that Scott will have no choice but to take Tony up on his offer 
   and let Billy fight in the cage matches. Diablo's second-in-command, 
   Mono (Daniel Martine), botches the torch job and kills Meme (Maggie 
   Mae Miller), the bar's beloved waitress, in the blaze (When Scott and 
   Billy hear the news of Meme's death, they both go on a crying jag 
   that must be seen to be believed!). When a steadfast Scott still 
   refuses to let Billy fight (he really is about the best friend anyone 
   could ever hope to have), Tony and Mario kidnap Billy and begin 
   training him to fight, under the ruse that he is helping Scott raise 
   money to rebuild the bar. When the police refuse to help Scott find 
   Billy, he sets out on his own, first by killing Diablo and Mono (who 
   suffers a fitting death by fire while begging Scott to kill him, 
   which he refuses to do!) and then heading to the cage match, where 
   Billy is about to fight in a series of punishing matches, the last 
   one against Chang. Scott gets captured and joins forces with female 
   reporter Morgan Garrett (Marilyn Tokuda) and undercover cop Tiger Joe 
   (erstwhile stuntman and bit actor supreme Al Leong) to save Billy and 
   get even with Tony, Tin Lum Yin and Mr. Costello. Scott must take 
   Billy's place in the ring and fight Tin Lum Yin's East Coast 
   champion, which leads to a shoot-out, many deaths and an unexpected 
   windfall for Scott and Billy.&nbsp; First off, how Lou Ferrigno 
   didn't win an Academy Award for his performance here is beyond my 
   comprehension (Oscar rule of thumb: Play a retard, dress in drag or 
   die of a terminal disease and you are guaranteed to get a 
   nomination). Yes, I am half-kidding, but the other half of me enjoyed 
   Ferrigno's performance immensely, as he is affecting and totally 
   believable as the retarded musclehead. It's probably the best role of 
   his career, acting-wise. Reb Brown also registers as Scott. His 
   protective friendship with Billy is quite touching. Secondly, there's 
   a lot more going on here than a simple action film. Director/producer 
   Lang Elliott (<B><A HREF="private_eyes_1981.htm">THE PRIVATE EYES</A></B> 
   - 1981) packs a lot of emotion on-screen, thanks to Hugh Kelly's 
   screenplay, especially the contrasting relationships between Scott 
   and Billy and Tony and Mario. Both Billy and Mario lack the 
   intelligence or will to survive on their own, but the way they are 
   treated by their prospective guardians is like apples and oranges. 
   The scene where Mario sympathizes with Billy while he is being beaten 
   to a pulp by one fighter (played by Matthias Hues) is heartfelt and 
   tugs at your emotions, as is their scene in the locker room where 
   Mario pleads with Billy to fight one more time to save both of their 
   lives. Call me an old softy, but <B><A HREF="cage_1989b.htm">CAGE</A></B> 
   is that rare action film that pulls at your heartstrings while 
   beating your body to a bloody pulp. Lang made a sequel, <B><A HREF="#Cage21994">CAGE
    II</A></B> in 1994 (once again using Hugh Kelley as the screenwriter 
   and Lou Ferrigno and Reb Brown as the stars), and it's about as lousy 
   a sequel as you will ever see. Look closely and you'll spot Danny 
   Trejo as Mr. Costello's bodyguard, Jimmy F. Skaggs as the &quot;Ugly 
   Guy&quot; and roller derby and wrestling veteran Queen Kong (nee Dee 
   Booher) as a member of Diablo's gang who gets punched in the face by 
   Scott. Also starring Dana Lee and Rion Hunter as Chinese albino Cheo 
   Tung. Originally released on VHS by Orion Home Video and available on

   that, while it reunites the main cast, director and screenwriter, 
   misses the mark completely on what made the original film so 
   successful: Its emotional core. Lou Ferrigno returns as hulking 
   simpleton Billy, who was rendered retarded during the Vietnam War by 
   getting shot in the head while saving Scott (Reb Brown) from an enemy 
   ambush. Since that day, Scott has become Billy's caregiver and best 
   friend. As Part II opens, Scott and Billy are attacked in a grocery 
   store by Chin (James Lew) and his gang, who leave Scott for dead and 
   kidnap Billy after shooting a tranquilizer dart into his stomach. 
   Billy becomes the star attraction of the Cage Cable Network, a brutal 
   fighting corporation (which now, unlike the first film, seems 
   perfectly legal) owned by Tin Lum Yin (James Shigata), the chief bad 
   guy in Part 1, who was supposedly crushed to death by Billy in the 
   finale, but survived and now must wear a full body brace and walk 
   with a cane. Tin Lum Yin keeps Billy in line by giving him daily

   forces with Interpol agent Tanaka (Leo Fong; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#LowBlow1986">LOW

   Sakimurai) to find Billy and infiltrate Tin Lum Yin's organization, 
   but they have to fight wave-after-wave of Yin's men, as well as a 
   Japanese Triad enforcer named Wang (Tadashi Yamashita). Billy, who 
   believes Scott is dead, begins to refuse the injections with the help 
   of pretty servant Mi Lo (Shannon Lee, in a degrading role), which 
   upsets Yin when Billy begins to get less aggressive and starts 
   showing mercy on his opponents in the cage matches (by 
   &quot;mercy&quot;, I mean he doesn't kill them). Billy begins to go 
   through withdrawal symptoms from the lack of injections, which Mi Lo 
   helps him get through with the use of acupuncture. Yin and Dr. Wo 
   (Gerald Okamura) want Billy to go back to taking the injections and 
   when Billy refuses (after finding out that Yin &quot;purchased&quot; 
   Mi Lo in Hong Kong when she was twelve years-old and used her as a 
   whore), Yin stages one final tournament before he leaves the city 
   with millions of dollars in gambling bets. Meanwhile, Scott (who has 
   been honing his fighting skills with Tanaka and Ogami's help) enters 
   the tournament under the alias &quot;Robert Parker&quot; (in one of 
   the most ridiculous disguises I have ever seen) and works his way up 
   the ranks. Yin, who is not fooled by Scott's disguise (believe me, a 
   blind man could spot it), comes up with a surefire way to kill two 
   birds with one stone: pit Scott and Billy against each other in the 
   final match while he burns down the building and absconds with the 
   millions. Of course, this all blows-up in Yin's face, as Billy and 
   Scott join forces with Tanaka and Ogami to stop the madness. When Yin 
   shoots Mi Lo in the back, Billy goes after him, but the severely 
   disappointing finale finds Billy shot three times and Yin escaping. 
   What The Fuck?!?&nbsp; While the original <B>CAGE</B> had a decent 
   budget and a star turn by Lou Ferrigno, this sequel is much too cheap 
   looking (check out the sparse audience members during the cage 
   matches) and is more concerned with fighting than characterization, 
   which was the original's strength. Ferrigno seems to forget that he's 
   supposed to be retarded in this film and acts more like Ferrigno than 
   a simpleton, which is a damned shame. The acting, by a series of 
   genre pros, is strictly generic (Leo Fong is absolutely terrible 
   here, but any Fong fan already knows that his thespian ability has 
   always been lacking) and returning director Lang Elliott (<B><A HREF="private_eyes_1981.htm">THE
    PRIVATE EYES</A></B> - 1981) and screenwriter Hugh Kelley seem more 
   interested in showing people beating the stuffing out of each other 
   (rather unconvincingly) and less about Scott and Billy's 
   relationship. Even Billy's relationship with Mi Lo rings hollow here, 
   making <B><A HREF="cage_2_1994b.htm">CAGE II</A></B> a bitter 
   disappointment. It's no better or worse than the multitude of 
   faceless DTV actioners that crammed the video shelves in the 90's. 
   What could have (and should have) been an interesting continuation of 
   the Scott/Billy dynamic is turned into a generic and disappointing 
   action flick with one of the worst cop-out finales (setting it up for 
   another sequel which, fortunately, never materialized) in action film 
   history. Also starring John Marino (simply horrible as the CCN ring 
   commentator), Thor Edgell, Steven Ito and Jon Turtle. Originally

   nudity, sexuality or bad language so that it is family-friendly. 
   Don't you believe it! While that statement is basically true, there's 
   enough violence (which they thankfully left out of the disclaimer) on 
   view here to make action fans happy. Senate candidate John Frank 
   Challenge (producer Earl Owensby) is about to hand over incriminating 
   documents to the State Crime Commission, which doesn't sit too well

    crime boss and businessman Mr. Guthrie (screenwriter William T. 
   Hicks). He hires three assassins (including one who's a martial arts 
   instructor) to kill Challenge, get the documents and also get a 
   second set which he has hidden at home. The assassins beat the snot 
   out of Challenge, steal the first set of documents and leave 
   Challenge bleeding (but not dead) and unconscious in a motel parking 
   lot. They then go to Challenge's house and accidentally knock out 
   Challenge's wife (Katheryn Thompson). Unable to find the second set 
   of documents, they burn down the house, killing Challenge's wife and 
   young daughter. Challenge is rushed to the hospital and, after 
   learning of his family's death, vows revenge on those responsible. 
   From here on, it's <B><A HREF="walking_tall_1973.htm">WALKING TALL</A></B> 
   (1973) time, as Challenge takes on everyone by himself. One-by-one, 
   Challenge kills those responsible (one involves a sharpened belt 
   buckle!), until he meets Mr. Guthrie for a final showdown.&nbsp; I 
   think what makes this different from most revenge flicks is that 
   Challenge gets revenge without actually killing anyone. They 
   basically kill themselves, but not without a little push from 
   Challenge. One crashes his car and it explodes (trying to get away 
   from Challenge). Another flies his plane into a forest (after running 
   out of fuel). Still another crashes through a window and falls to his 
   death (after missing a flying kick aimed at Challenge). Finally, Mr. 
   Guthrie drops dead of a heart attack running away from Challenge (who 
   fires his shotgun into the air, basically scaring Guthrie to death). 
   Earl Owensby (this is his first film, both as actor and producer), 
   who was never accused of being a good actor, made a career of 
   churning out these little regional actioners from his Shelby, North 
   Carolina production facility and they were very popular in the South. 
   He apparently knew his limitations as an actor, as his roles gave him 
   minimal dialogue (in one film, 1976's <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#DarkSunday1976">DARK
    SUNDAY</A></B>, he plays a mute preacher out for revenge!), giving 
   the other actors the lion's share of the lines. After the films 
   opening disclaimer, it was unnerving to view Owensby's plentiful back 
   hair (apparently, that's family-friendly). Truth be told, I would 
   rather see nudity. Director Martin Beck handles the action rather 
   proficiently, offering us a long car chase through the back streets 
   of Shelby, a prop plane chase and some other nice set pieces. The 
   only thing that drags is the cheesy country ballad/flashback that 
   comes two-thirds into the film. <B><A HREF="challenge_1973b.htm">CHALLENGE</A></B>

   dictator Garcia (Jose Guerra). Roger doesn't trust the government 
   very much because, years before, he and some other soldiers went to

    it's obvious that there's a traitor within their ranks. Gabriel 
   thinks it's Marisol and shoots her point-blank in the stomach after 
   ripping open blouse and discovering that her breasts aren't 
   disfigured (She previously had stated that Garcia's men scarred her 
   breasts in a torture session years before, which is a reverse 
   take-off on a truly disturbing scene in the first film). When Rafael 
   (Cesar Olmo), the leader of the freedom fighters, is captured and 
   tortured by Garcia and his minions, Roger, Gabriel and a select few 
   freedom fighters attempt to rescue him, even though the American 
   government has called off the assassination and wants Roger to return 
   to the States. Even though they manage to rescue Rafael, the rescue 
   attempt turns out to be a trap and only Roger, Gabriel and Rafael 
   escape with their lives. When the real traitor tips his hand, Roger 
   kills him, but soon finds out that his entire mission was a setup 
   conducted by Garcia to flush out the freedom fighters and kill them.

   After their friend Jim is killed by Longo, Frank Barnes (Jim Mitchum)

    one of the detectives and has a fairly good-sized role) and 
   released. Larson reforms his old Vietnam War group, The Zebra Force, 
   which consists of people that Longo is killing. Barnes joins the 
   force to avenge Jim's death and meets member Jim Bob Cougar (Timothy 
   Brown), the only other member of The Zebra Force still left alive. 
   Barnes, Larson and Cougar are ambushed by Longo at their friend's 
   funeral and Larson is killed. Longo becomes a loose cannon, much to 
   the dismay of local crime lord Voce (Joe Donte), who is losing too 
   many of his men who are assisting Longo in fulfilling his 
   revenge.&nbsp; Barnes and Cougar kidnap Crazy Danny (Charles 
   Dierkop), a Voce associate, and pump him for info on Longo's plans. 
   Barnes and Cougar then go on a systematic tour of destruction, 
   killing two goons by oversweating them in a sauna and hiring some 
   merceneries (which includes Robert Z'Dar) to help them. They then rob 
   Voce's personal armoury to get the weapons they need to get their 
   revenge. Longo puts pressure on mob lawyer Kozlo (Frank Sinatra Jr., 
   who's surprisingly good) to locate Crazy Danny and find out what he 
   told Barnes and Cougar. It's not long before all hell breaks loose as 
   bullets fly, people die and Barnes faces a personal problem which 
   involves his girlfriend Julie (Deana Jurgens). This film contains a 
   cast that is full of B-movie staples. Besides the people already 
   mentioned, there's Lindsay Crosby, Robert Dryer (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Savage Streets">SAVAGE

   Angel (<B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Love Butcher">THE LOVE BUTCHER</A></B> 
   - 1975). Director Tornatore fills the film with plenty of explosions, 
   car chases, stunts and other bloodshed, some of it filmed with 
   Tornatore's patented Peckinpah-like slow-motion photography. Jim 
   Mitchum (<B><A HREF="#Hollywood Cop">HOLLYWOOD COP</A></B> - 1986) is 
   just as good and actor as brother Chris Mitchum (<B><A HREF="#Final Score">FINAL
    SCORE</A></B> - 1986), but that's not saying much. He spends most of 
   his time running around firing weapons, so acting takes a back seat

   Action-packed, but brainless, Filipino actioner set during the 
   Vietnam War. The prologue shows a French army convoy being ambushed 
   by the Vietcong in 1950. They kill all the French soldiers and steal 
   millions of dollars in art, important documents and diamonds that the 
   convoy was transporting. Flash-forward fifteen years and a group of 
   American commandos are raiding a secret underground tunnel that is 
   the headquarters for VC General Diap (Ken Watanabe). After killing 
   all the VC in the tunnel and<A HREF="commando_invasion_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/commando invasion vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="130" HEIGHT="227" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   capturing General Diap, the leader of the commandos, Captain Brady 
   (Michael James), calls for a pick-up but, for reasons unknown until 
   much later, some of the squad members point their weapons at Captain 
   Brady. When back-up finally arrives, they find all of Brady's men 
   shot dead and Brady lying unconscious with a fistful of diamonds in 
   his hands. Brady is brought to court martial, but is given five days 
   to bring General Diap back to prove his innocence. Brady joins a 
   group of VC freedom fighters in his search for Diap and even recruits 
   a VC nurse, Akina (Carol Roberts), to help get into Diap's compound 
   (she's Diap's mistress). She manages to walk through the compound 
   unnoticed and leads Brady right to Diap, where he takes him prisoner 
   for a second time. As they are leaving the compound, a welcoming 
   committee is waiting and they must fight their way out. When Brady 
   asks Diap why he killed his men, Diap says, &quot;Do I know 
   you?&quot;, which makes Brady look like a liar in the eyes of Captain 
   Terryl (Pat Vance), who was sent with Brady on his quest (and whose 
   brother was killed in the first raid). Brady and his men are ambushed 
   as they turn every corner, as if someone doesn't want him to make it 
   back. Could it be the mysterious General McMoreland (Gordon 
   Mitchell), who may know more than he is letting on? A squad of French 
   soldiers also want Diap because they think he knows the location of 
   the treasure stolen fifteen years earlier. After saving each other's 
   hides a couple of times, the French forge an uneasy alliance with 
   Brady and agree to take possession of Diap only after he testifies at 
   Brady's court martial. That's easier said than done, as making it to 
   the trial will be no easy task. Diap keeps bribing the soldiers with 
   diamonds to let him escape and Brady must then decide whether to kill 
   Diap or bring him back for the trial. If you ask me, the only good 
   gook is a dead gook.&nbsp; Though not as wild and insane as a lot of

   killer soldiers. Morgan is forced to kill the assassin before he can 
   interrogate him, so he and Hawk (who suddenly reappears) confront 
   Col. Kasler, who finally spills the beans. It seems Kasler, the dead 
   officer from the beginning of the film and another officer witnessed 
   Major Shooman and the Cobra Force slaughter an entire village of 
   innocent Vietnamese men, women and children, but the U.S. government 
   would rather cover it up (shades of the true-life Mei Lai Massacre) 
   and not make the rest of the world aware that American soldiers are 
   capable of such heinous acts during wartime. As Morgan and Hawk race 
   to protect the third officer, they will soon discover that the 
   difference between the good guys and the bad guys is just the width

   (There's even a large amount of stock Vietnam war footage to round 
   out the package). Brent Huff (who sports a distracting dangly earring 
   in his left ear) is simply awful here. His idea of &quot;acting&quot; 
   is to scream out all his lines (it becomes unintentionally funny 
   after a while) and Max Laurel, who was so memorable as <B><A HREF="zuma_1985.htm">ZUMA</A></B> 
   (1985), is dubbed by someone with a very high-pitched voice, making 
   his character seem more like a parody than a real person. Laurel also 
   disappears mysteriously several times throughout the film. It's as if 
   he wasn't available to film some of his scenes and is so noticeable, 
   it becomes distracting. And, call me crazy, but did I spot mid-80's 
   style bathing suits on view during the opening scene?There are also 
   plenty of other examples of objects (cars and weapons) that shouldn't 
   be seen in a film set in the mid-70's. That's just lazy filmmaking.

    OF DEATH</A><A NAME="CourierOfDeath"></A> (1984) -</B> This inept, 
   though thoroughly entertaining, regional actioner (lensed in 
   Portland, Oregon) opens with professional courier J.D. (Joey Johnson) 
   and his partner Frank (Bill Hupfer) trying to outrun a bunch of goons 
   who want a briefcase containing $2 million that is handcuffed to 
   Frank's wrist, Unable to outrun the goons' Trans Am with their van, 
   J.D. and Frank pull into a park and get into a gunfight. Frank is 
   killed (He is shot in the leg and then point-blank in the head. When 
   one of the goons is unable to free the briefcase from Frank's wrist, 
   he blows off Frank's hand with a few well-placed shots from his 
   pistol!), but J.D. is able to kill all the goons and deliver the 
   briefcase. J.D.'s next assignment doesn't go well at all. His wife 
   Julie (Joan Becherich) is kidnapped and murdered before his eyes 
   after he turns over a briefcase he picked up in San Francisco. The 
   murderers behind Julie's death are the same people who hired the 
   goons to steal the briefcase from Frank, so J.D., who gets help from 
   his old Army commanding officer known only as &quot;The Colonel&quot; 
   (James Jameson), sets out to kill all those responsible for his 
   wife's death. The Colonel tells J.D. that those involved belong to a 
   fascist organization that supply money and weapons to terrorists, so 
   J.D. begins leaving a bunch of dead bodies in his wake as he inches 
   closer and closer to his goal. He kills three guys in a strip bar 
   when they refuse to answer his questions (&quot;Wrong answer, 
   dude!&quot;), saves his friend Nancy (Diana <A HREF="courier_of_death_1984.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/courier of death vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="281" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>Bauer)
    from two rapists (they torture her with knives and a lit cigarette) 
   and then shoots Nancy's pimp boyfriend at a bar (he shoots him in the 
   balls after slicing his face with a broken bottle). He then shotguns 
   five guys who try to attack him and his wife's best friend Katie 
   (Barbara Garrison) and then forces another guy to commit suicide 
   after he gives J.D. an important clue. The fascists send a female 
   assassin named Angel (Amy Sachel) to dispose of J.D. and she almost 
   succeeds (she kicks him between the legs several times with her 
   stiletto heels), but J.D. tricks her into drinking a poisoned glass 
   of champagne (the old &quot;switch the poison glass&quot; trick). 
   J.D. manages to kill nearly everyone in the fascist organization, 
   including ringleader Bigelow (John H. Schmeer, who was also this 
   film's Cinematographer), but soon finds out that the Colonel used him 
   to get the $76 million in bonds that Bigelow kept in a briefcase 
   (Doesn't anyone keep money in safes anymore?). To say anymore would 
   spoil the final surprise.&nbsp; I can't begin to describe how 
   impossibly infectious this film is. It should fail on all levels 
   (and, really, it does), but it is so logic-defying and non-stop 
   violent, you can't help but keep your eyes on the screen. It's like 
   watching a huge pile-up on the freeway where no one survives, only 
   all the dead bodies are the most ugly people this side of a trailer 
   park crackhouse (Just what is in Portland's water anyway?&nbsp; Why 
   is everyone in this film so butt-ugly?). Perm-headed Joey Johnson is 
   simply indescribable as J.D., who is supposed to abhor violence, but 
   quickly (and I do mean quickly) begins beating up (usually with his 
   handy collapsible baton) or killing as many people as humanly 
   possible. He's like Dirty Harry without the badge (or talent), as he 
   blows away people left and right, usually for just looking at him 
   funny. Director/producer Tom Shaw, who sadly never directed anything 
   else, fills the screen with so much bloody Grade Z action, including 
   shootings, stabbings, slashings and explosions, it's almost possible 
   to overlook Ron Schmidt's plothole-laden script (he was also this 
   film's Production Manager). Almost. People appear and disappear for 
   no rhyme or reason other than to be victims of J.D.'s revenge and the 
   finale left me shaking my head in disbelief. It really is one of the 
   looniest and out-of-left-field conclusions that I have witnessed in 
   quite a while. When director Shaw doesn't know how to end a scene, he 
   simply puts J.D. in the cockpit of a Piper Cub with his overweight 
   pilot friend, where they discuss what just happened! <B>COURIER OF DEATH</B> 
   could quite possibly be one of the finest examples where everything 
   goes wrong, yet it all gels as a whole, making this film one of the 
   most enjoyably bad U.S.-made action films of the 80's. I haven't even 
   touched the surface of what this film has to offer, including 
   terrible acting (watch Angel's scene), lousy sound editing (when J.D. 
   hears the guy's suicide, it sounds like a cap pistol muffled by a 
   pillow!) and unbelievable situations (including J.D. turning down 
   Katie's offer to take a shower with him because he's &quot;not 
   ready&quot;!). Oh, what fun you are going to have if you are lucky 
   enough to get your hands on a copy of this! The city of Portland 
   should use this film as a tourist attraction (&quot;Come to Portland. 
   Chances are you are better-looking than us!&quot; or &quot;Hey, would 
   you like to have your child's life threatened at gunpoint? Then come 
   visit one of our many fine parks!&quot;). Simply remarkable. Also 
   starring Mel Fletcher, Leo Gossen, Rebecca Steele and John Benneth.

   report that, yes, it is. In the opening, police detective Zeus

    Bliesener) goes on TV and announces his war on drugs and crime, the 
   Police Chief (Leo G. Morrell) begs Zeus to come back (Zeus says, 
   &quot;How can I come back now? You broke my heart!&quot;) when the 
   President's ex-wife and adoptive daughter are brutally murdered. Zeus 
   finally relents and rescues a young girl and she is able to pick out 
   one of the killers by his mug shot. When the little girl is killed by 
   the crime organization, Zeus gathers his Vietnam buddies together 
   (both of them) to exact some vengeance, but first they need some 
   strict military training to get into shape (this sequence is a real 
   howler, as Zeus and his comrades go through their training with a 
   no-nonsense drill sargeant while having flashbacks of their time as 
   P.O.W.s back in Nam). Once their training is done, Zeus and his two 
   buddies go on an all-out assault on the crime organization's 
   compound, armed with silencers, AK-47s and their own deadly hands. 
   Zeus begins to kill all the bad guys one-by-one (including one 
   memorable death with a switchblade hidden in his sleeve) until he 
   meets the female head of the organization, who tries to seduce Zeus, 
   but ends up dead by one of her own devices.&nbsp; Director George 
   Pan-Andreas, who speaks with such a thick Greek accent that he's hard 
   to understand on several occasions, has surely made a lousy film, but 
   it is so damned watchable and full of hilarious set pieces and 
   quotable dialogue, you'll be glad you watched it. My favorite scene 
   is when he gets into a martial arts/knife fight with one thug, 
   disarms him, cuts the thug's face and then proudly proclaims, 
   &quot;They call me Zeus... The Crime Killer!&quot; (The film's 
   alternate title is <B><A HREF="zeus_the_crime_killer_1985.htm">ZEUS: 
   THE CRIME KILLER</A></B>) Another side-splitting scene finds Zeus 
   infiltrating the crime organization disguised as Pedro the Mexican 
   gardener, only he ends up getting beaten to a pulp, his throat 
   slashed and a cigarette extinguished on his leg! I could go on-and-on 
   about all the visual and auditory nuggets this film has to offer, 
   like when Zeus' wife says to him, &quot;Is that all you care about, 
   justice and uzo?&quot;, but I would rather you experience them 
   first-hand as to get the full effect. Though basically a vanity 
   project for Pan-Andreas (he's the only actor listed in the crazy 
   opening credits), there's plenty of other stuff to laugh at, from the 
   badly-staged martial arts fights (Zeus screams like a little girl 
   every time he gets hit), to the unbelievable action sequences (check 
   out the motorcycle stunt which results in one of the main bad guys 
   getting a nasty tire burn on his face!). The film is very bloody in 
   spots, including a nasty throat slashing (the effects are 
   surprisingly well done) and wait until you get to the surreal ending 
   involving Zeus and the President. I was laughing so hard I nearly 
   pissed myself! This is cheese of the highest order and essential to 
   every badfilm fan. Pan-Andreas shot a sequel to this in 2003, titled <B><A HREF="golden_target_2003.htm">GOLDEN

    WARRIORS</A></B> - 1987) declares war in the marijuana and cocaine 
   growers and, with the help of U.N. forces, begins burning down all of 
   the illegal drug farms. The General is not too cooperative with the 
   international press, though (and with good reason), so when nosy 
   reporter Helen (Brigitte Porsh) notices that American William Corbett 
   (Richard Randall) has arrived in-country secretly at the General's 
   request, she cozies-up to him and becomes his lover, looking for the 
   &quot;big&quot; story. William agrees to take her to visit the 
   General at his country home (after she and William are attacked 
   leaving a casino, where Helen proves quite adept in the martial arts) 
   and we learn that the General has strange Macumba supernatural 
   powers, like the ability to shoot electricity from his fingertips. 
   William and the General are business partners in an illegal drug 
   cartel (the General burned down all the drug farms not only to get 
   the U.N. off his back, but also to start his own drug business) and 
   the General has picked three parcels of land to start growing

   some of his fingertip electrical skills on Helen's cranium (I told 
   you it gets stranger!). When William and Helen leave the General's 
   home, their Jeep breaks down and they hop on a passing bus, only to 
   have the bus attacked by some of the General's men. When a child on 
   the bus is shot dead, Helen goes bonkers, grabs a machine gun and 
   begins shooting back, killing several of the General's men. William 
   and Helen are then taken prisoner along with some Contra rebels and 
   the General makes them all work in the mines as slaves at the dreaded 
   &quot;Gates of Paradise&quot;, a secret underground location where 
   something unknown and evil is going on. Willian and Helen are saved 
   by Contra leader David (Peter Hintz; <B><A HREF="#ApocalypseMercs1987">APOCALYPSE

   locating and freeing all the slaves that work at the Gates of 
   Paradise. This involves Contra women, including Myra, infiltrating 
   the camp as prostitutes and, while the guards are getting their rocks 
   off, David, William and the Contra fighters sneak in. It doesn't go 
   as planned. When Helen is taken prisoner and tortured by the General 
   and Astaroth, William reveals that he is actually a U.S. Marine 
   working undercover to bring down the General and leads the Contras on 
   a raid of the General's compound to rescue Helen (he fails miserably)

    COMMANDOS</A><A NAME="DaredevilCommandos"></A> (1985) -</B> A rare 
   Indonesian action misfire, this one taking place in the early 1940's, 
   as Indonesian freedom fighters try to wrestle their country away from 
   the Dutch occupational forces. The film opens with the freedom 
   fighters attacking a Dutch military base (lots of explosion and 
   people on both sides getting riddled with bullets), only to have the 
   Dutch capture the leader of the freedom fighters, who bites his own 
   tongue off when he is questioned and gets shot for not cooperating. 
   The Captain of the Dutch military base wants to question the 
   villagers as to where the freedom fighters, known as the Daredevil 
   Commandos, are hiding and kill all those who won't assist them, but 
   the Captain's second-in-command temporarily talks the Captain out of 
   it, because the eyes of the world are on Indonesia and a mass 
   slaughter of innocent people would not be in the best interest for 
   the Dutch. Sergeant Major Hassim (Barry Prima; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Warrior1981">THE

   ammunition because they cannot protect all the villages and win the 
   war without them. Morale is also at an all-time low (Sgt. Hassim 
   kicks the shit out of one of his comrades when the man threatens to 
   report another soldier getting cozy with a female nurse), so when 
   Sgt. Hassim is offered a mission to investigate a burned-out village, 
   he grabs the rest of his team to investigate. It turns out to be a 
   trap set-up by the Dutch and that crazy Dutch Captain. Low on 
   ammunition, the Daredevil Commandos nevertheless win the battle using 
   sheer brute strength (One of the Daredevils is killed, though), which 
   severely pisses-off the Dutch Captain, who steps-up the brutality 
   (World view be damned!) by raping women and shooting innocent 
   villagers (Abib [Advent Bangun; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#BlindWarrior">THE
    BLIND WARRIOR</A></B> - 1985], one of Sgt. Hassim's Daredevils, 
   witnessed his sister and mother being raped by the Dutch when he was 
   younger and these newer instances are waking-up long-suppressed 
   memories). The Dutch are aware that the freedom fighters are running 
   low on weapons, ammunition and food, so they plan on one final 
   big-scale attack to wipe them off the face of the Earth. What the 
   Dutch didn't count on is the resiliency of the Indonesian people, as 
   the Daredevil Commandos plan to strike the Dutch where it will hurt 
   them the worst: At their huge compound where the Dutch store a large 
   cache of weapons, ammunition and food. It seems the only way to truly 
   surprise the Dutch at the compound is to climb down a huge vertical 
   cliff, so Sgt. Hassim and his men train hard for the mission. Will 
   this be the mission that will finally make the Dutch exit Indonesia 
   for good?&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to most Indonesian actioners, <B><A HREF="daredevil_commandos_1985d.htm">DAREDEVIL
    COMMANDOS</A></B> seems more subdued in the violence department than 
   most, which is weird since it was written by Iman Tantowi, who wrote 
   the screenplays for such ultra-violent Indonesian films such as <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Primitives">PRIMITIVES</A></B>

   (1982) and <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Devil'sSword">THE DEVIL'S SWORD</A></B> 
   (1984). The direction, by E.G. Bakker (who has no other film credits 
   that I can find and may be a pseudonym), is rather flat and 
   uninvolving, and he seems more interested in patriotic speeches 
   rather than action through the first two-thirds of the film (at one 
   point, just before a battle, the Daredevil Commandos break out into a 
   patriotic song that begins with &quot;Indonesia, you are my 
   country...&quot;). When the final battle does come at the Dutch 
   compound (but not before more singing and prayers), it turns into a 
   pretty bloody and stunt-filled extravaganza, with plenty of 
   explosions, gunfights and bullet squibs, but it still pales in 
   comparison to most Indonesian actioners because it doesn't contain a 
   single &quot;What The Fuck?!?&quot; moment, something we've come to 
   expect from these flicks. In all good faith, I can't honestly 
   recommend <B><A HREF="daredevil_commandos_1985b.htm">DAREDEVIL COMMANDOS</A></B>.

    Let me talk about this film's bad points: The action is lazily 
   staged, the violence too restrained for its own good (in the film's 
   defense, the print I viewed may have been edited) and the dialogue 
   laughable, but not in a funny way. The usually dependable Franco Nero 
   looks to be sleepwalking through his role as Cobra. His 
   &quot;trademark&quot; in this film is spitting out his gum or 
   sticking it in unusual places, like a thug's forehead. It is supposed 
   to be funny, but it comes off as forced (Nero's mouth is always 
   moving, even when he doesn't talk!). It's also obvious that Nero used 
   a stuntman for some of his more strenuous scenes, including jumping 
   and climbing from building-to-building (another &quot;trademark&quot;)
    and a long fight scene in an alleyway. Even when Cobra's son Tim is 
   killed, run over on orders by Goldsmith, the film rings hollow. We 
   see Cobra crying, as he has memories of the good times he and Tim had 
   (including an uncomfortable game of two-man baseball where it is 
   apparent Nero didn't know how to swing a bat at a ball). In the very 
   next scene, it looks as if he has gotten over it.&nbsp; Director Enzo 
   G. Castellari has certainly done much better, including the 
   post-apocalypse films <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Nine90BronxWar1982">1990:
    THE BRONX WARRIORS</A></B> - 1982; its sequel <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#BronxWarriors2">BRONX

    HEROIN BUSTERS</A></B> (1977) and <B><A HREF="street_law_1974.htm">STREET

   The screenplay, by Fabio &amp; Tito Carpi (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SevenMurdersScotlan">SEVEN

    Here are some of the few positive points: When Lola gets into a 
   fight with Cobra in an empty disco (she uses martial arts moves to 
   kick the crap out of him!), it is revealed Lola is actually a man. 
   Their fight is made to look<A HREF="day_of_the_cobra_1980_italy_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/day of the cobra italy poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="195" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   like they are dancing on the disco floor, making it the film's most 
   inventive scene. Still, it's a cheat on the audience since Licinia 
   Lentini is actually a woman and an obvious double was used when 
   unmasking her false femininity. There are also a couple of deaths 
   that are memorable. When a blonde assassin (Sasha D'Arc; <B><A HREF="sheriff_and_the_satellite_kid_1979.htm">THE
    SHERIFF AND THE SATELLITE KID</A></B> - 1979) fails to kill Cobra, 
   it leads to a chase that ends in a gunfight. Cobra shoots a drum of 
   gasoline, sending the assassin high into the air. There is also a 
   scene where Cobra is trapped in a warehouse and he gets away by 
   planting a pickaxe into Martino's (the late Ennio Girolami, 
   Castellari's brother, who acted using the name &quot;Thomas 
   Moore&quot;; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#FeastOfSatan">THE FEAST OF SATAN</A></B>

    The only release this film received in the United States was a 
   fullscreen VHS release from <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Media Home Ent.">Media
    Home Entertainment</A>. It looks to be edited in some scenes, the 
   most notable edits come during Tim's death (Italian crime films have 
   no problem showing children getting killed) and the finale, when 
   Cobra enters Goldsmith's office and point his gun at him, accusing 
   Jack of ordering his son's death (we even get a peek at the boy's 
   killing in Cobra's mind, images that were missing from the film at 
   the time of the Tim's death). We hear the gun go off and then there 
   is a jump edit where Cobra enters an elevator. Although Kadinsky's 
   face is purposely kept off-screen, the one time we do get an obscured 
   look at his face, it is that of Michele Soavi, future director of <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Church1989">THE

   Girolami Goodwin, as Papasian's secretary and Castellari himself as

   kidnap Kathy and take her away in a helicopter, where she takes them 
   to an abandoned ranch where the money is hidden. George and Lou are 
   in hot pursuit and the finale finds the bad guys getting killed, then

   This Italian production, filmed on location in Las Vegas, Nevada and 
   Phoenix, Arizona is a pretty good comedy action film and Bo Svenson 
   and Fred Williamson look like they are having a ball, even if some of 
   the dialogue is clunky. Director/producer/co-scripter Fabrizio

   Ludman&quot;, tosses in many car chases (lots of crashes, jumps and 
   flips in slow-motion), gun fights and a helicopter chase to please 
   action fans. The gay bar scene doesn't make an ounce of sense, but it 
   sure is funny. It's as if DeAngelis and co-scripter Dardano Sacchetti 
   (using his &quot;David Parker Jr.&quot; pseudonym) threw that scene 
   in for no reason other than to see how many men could act 
   &quot;gay&quot; at one time (like some crazy bar wager). Italian

   kills people showing no emotion, killing George's girlfriend by

   an RJ45 jack), not to mention some ridiculous, totally made-up

    BLOW</A><A NAME="DeathBlow1979"></A> (1979) -</B> Here's your chance 
   to see champion heavyweight boxer Duane Bobick in his only starring 
   role and after watching his performance, you will know why his acting 
   career was much shorter than his boxing career (as a professional 
   boxer from 1973 to 1979, Bobick had a record of 48 wins and 4 losses; 
   42 of those wins by knockout). This South Africa-lensed boxing 
   actioner stars Bobick as Billyboy Lamont, a burly dock worker and 
   university student who wants to be a professional boxer like his 
   father, Don (screenwriter Willie Von Rensburg), but dear old Pop 
   discourages him from doing so, telling him, &quot;This, my boy, is 
   what fifteen years of fighting and being champ has got me: Ten acres 
   of lousy, bloody ground, an old house, a few animals, that's all. 
   There's a new champ, Billy, and he belongs to another family.&quot; 
   The new champ is Terry Bendell (Tullio Moneta), whose mother, 
   Josephine (Molly Softel), reaches sexual ecstasy while watching her 
   son box in the ring (incest is implied). Terry has a diminutive 
   brother named Mike (Dawie Malan), who is estranged from mother 
   Josephine, probably due to her hands-on approach to managing Terry's 
   career (even though Mike is officially Terry's manager) and her 
   indifferent <A HREF="death_blow_1979.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/death blow british vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="173" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>treatment
    of him. Billyboy secretly practices boxing in a gym away from his 
   father's prying eyes (Pop would rather Billyboy &quot;hit the 
   books&quot; and make something out of his life) and has become quite 
   good at it (Bobick looks at least 15 years too old to be portraying a 
   guy supposedly college age). When Pop catches Billyboy at the gym 
   instead of studying at the university, he decides to teach him a 
   lesson and challenges Billyboy to a boxing match in the ring. 
   Billyboy doesn't want to do it, but when his father hits him in the 
   face and body with a few good shots, he retaliates with one hard 
   punch, sending Pop flying across the ring and paralyzing him for 
   life. When Josephine reads the story in the paper (she holds some 
   as-yet unknown grudge against Billyboy's father), she tells Terry 
   that maybe someday he will do the same thing to Billyboy in the ring. 
   Meanwhile, the short-statured Mike catches the eye of barmaid Janet 
   (Barbara Salberg) at a disco and accidentally gets her fired from her 
   job. He feels so bad about it that he promises to get her a better 
   job, but she doesn't believe him. Mike gets Janet a job as a maid at 
   the Bendell household, but Josephine tells him to keep his hands off 
   of her now that she is the hired help. We also learn that Terry is 
   actually the son of Billyboy's father, but he left Josephine alone 
   and pregnant to marry Martha (Trix Pienaar), who gave birth to 
   Billyboy nine month later. Josephine has been holding that grudge for 
   many, many years and after marrying a millionaire and giving birth to 
   the dwarf-like Mike (did I mention she despises him and treats him 
   like shit?), she has groomed Terry to be her means of retribution. 
   Terry has grown up to be a first class lout and ends up screwing 
   Janet even though he knows that Mike has feelings for her (When 
   Josephine tells Terry that Janet is &quot;beneath him&quot;, he 
   replies coldly, &quot;I know. But she's handy.&quot;). Billyboy 
   decides to become a professional boxer, even though his father may 
   have permanently damaged Billyboy's kidneys during their fight 
   (Billyboy can't take a leak without pissing blood.). He fights a 
   series of boxers and works his way up the ranks until, yes, you 
   guessed it, he becomes the number one contender against Terry. Which 
   one of these &quot;brothers from different mothers&quot; will turn 
   out to be champ?&nbsp; This totally boring boxing drama, directed by 
   Tim Spring (<B><A HREF="tim_spring_directed_films.htm">REASON TO DIE</A></B> 
   - 1989; <B><A HREF="tim_spring_directed_films.htm">DOUBLE BLAST</A></B> 
   - 1994; <B><A HREF="tim_spring_directed_films.htm">RAW TARGET</A></B> 
   - 1995), shows why most boxers shouldn't become actors. Boxing may be 
   an art form, but so is acting. Duane Bobick couldn't be more wooden 
   if you stuffed him full of cedar chips and his stabs at emoting is 
   pitiful and not in a &quot;so bad, it's hilarious&quot; way. When his 
   girlfriend, Velma (Kim Braden), is raped by Terry (she is sexually 
   assaulted fully clothed by Terry in a gym ring while intercut with 
   one of Billyboy's bouts), his reaction is worse than no reaction at 
   all. It is like he just picked up a carton of eggs at the store and 
   found one of them broken! The fault is not all Bobick's, as the 
   acting is generally poor across the board (Tullio Moneta as Terry is 
   really, really bad) and the only person here who generates any 
   sympathy is Dawie Malan as Mike, but that's mainly because he is 
   small and abused by everyone (When Janet commits suicide, Terry 
   laughs in Mike's face, not exactly the reaction Mike was expecting!). 
   There is some bloody violence on view, but most of it is outside the 
   ring (nearly all the boxing matches are economically filmed and lack 
   the &quot;oomph&quot; we've come to expect after the commercial 
   success of <B><A HREF="rocky_1976.htm">ROCKY</A></B> [1976], which 
   this film so clearly tries to emulate). There's a gunshot to the 
   head, Velma's rape, a dockside fight and a couple of other incidents, 
   but nothing to make you stand up and take notice. <B>DEATH BLOW</B> 
   is an instantly forgettable boxing actioner that offers nothing new 
   or interesting to the viewer besides the funky South African accents.

   across the room and through the door of the adjoining hotel room, 
   which is occupied by Babs, who is in the middle of changing her 
   clothes. While Jo is on the floor admiring Babs' form, he notices a 
   small tape recorder hidden under one of her tables (she's being 
   bugged). Jo removes the tape recorder and Tom tells Babs that he 
   needs to talk to her about Mr. Rogers' death. When Jo goes to his 
   hotel room, he finds Michele waiting for him. It turns out she's the 
   assistant manager of the hotel and she asks Jo whether he takes a 
   bath or a shower (it's a shower). Knowing that is a strange question 
   to ask a stranger, Jo immediately knows something is up and he's 
   right. His bathtub is full of flesh-dissolving acid and when he goes 
   to the bathroom, he hears someone sneaking into his room. Jo moans 
   out loud, as if the acid is dissolving his body. The thug enters the 
   bathroom to see the results and a short scuffle ensues, resulting in 
   Jo throwing the thug in the bathtub. Inspector DaSilva (A. Jayaratna) 
   arrives at Jo's room and, after seeing the thug's dissolved corpse, 
   tells Jo that the Golden Cats usually dump their victims' bodies in 
   the sewer and this isn't the first time he has seen an acid-washed 
   corpse (unfortunately, we never get to see the body). King, along 
   with goons Nitro (Siegfried Rauch; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Contamination1980">CONTAMINATION</A></B> 
   - 1980) and Sunny (H.D. Kalatunga), are at the hotel bar, keeping a 
   close eye on Jo and Tom. They think Jo was killed in the shower and 
   are surprised to see him with the Inspector and Babs in the hotel 
   lounge, so they must think of another way to kill him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Michele sneaks into Nitro's hotel room and tries to do something to 
   his phone, but Nitro enters unexpectedly, forcing Michele to hide. 
   She overhears Nitro telling King that he plans on blowing up Jo with 
   some nitroglycerine (They don't call him Nitro for nothing!) and 
   tells King how he plans to do it. King walks down to the lounge, 
   placing a small bottle of nitroglycerine on a table next to Jo, Tom, 
   Babs and the Inspector. Babs recognises King, but she tells the 
   Inspector that he seems familiar, but she can't place the face 
   (Really? C'mon now!). Meanwhile, Nitro catches Michele in his room 
   and ties her up, while he is on the terrace, pointing a sniper rifle 
   at the small bottle on the table. Tom sees a reflection in the sun of 
   the scope of the sniper rifle and begins firing his pistol in Nitro's 
   direction, causing him to miss the bottle. Jo hands Tom the bottle 
   and he throws it into the ocean, where it explodes. This leads to a 
   pretty good rooftop chase between Tom and King, both of them using a 
   palm tree to reverse pole vault to the ground (!). King escapes but 
   Sunny is captured. He then escapes by jumping off a bridge on to a 
   moving train, the Inspector, Jo and Tom giving chase in Jeeps. The 
   Inspector proves what a crack shot he is by shooting Sunny in the 
   head, while his Jeep speeds over tough beach terrain. Philip Dawson 
   tells Jo and Tom that Sunny was a member of the Golden Cats, but Jo 
   and Tom are suspicious of the Inspector, because he excused himself 
   just before Nitro fired his sniper rifle and they both think he acted 
   a little too quick on the draw when he shot Sunny in the head. Is it 
   possible that Inspector DaSilva is a member of the Golden Cats?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Jo goes for a swim in the ocean, but first, Tom gives him a 
   cigarette with a load in it (Because Jo always complains when Tom 
   asks him for a cigarette. In this series, they always play practical 
   jokes on each other.). Jo knows something is up and gives the 
   cigarette to the Inspector's assistant, Khamar (Joe Abey), who lights 
   the cigarette and it explodes in his face (Khamar tells Tom that he 
   should arrest Jo for attempted murder!). Jo meets a bikini-clad Babs 
   on the beach and she slaps Jo's face when she thinks he is getting 
   fresh with him, but it's a crab walking across her bosom! It's not 
   long before Babs starts making googly eyes at Jo because, well, he's 
   irresistable. A little later, Khamar gives them a tip, so Tom and Jo 
   take jitneys through the streets of Ceylon to talk to a female 
   photographer who may have taken photos key to their investigation. 
   When they get to her house, they find her dead in her bed, a apparent 
   victim of a poisoning. In her hand is a small golden cat statue, the 
   criminal organization's calling card. They find her young son is in 
   the house looking for something to eat. He walks up to Jo and Tom and 
   says, &quot;Why doesn't Mama get up?&quot; (Do I hear violins?). 
   Michele then appears at the house, telling the crime-fighting duo 
   that the photographer was her brother's wife and her best friend, 
   also telling them that the Golden Cats killed her sister. She gives 
   them some important information about the Golden Cats, which leads Jo 
   and Tom to an all-female karate school, where the Inspector is hiding 
   Babs so she'll be &quot;safe&quot;.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    For reasons still not clear to me, the perpetually drunk Philip 
   Dawson is in Bombay, India to pay the Golden Cats a million dollars. 
   Dawson picks up the money at a small airport, where King has a cobra 
   bite and kill Dawson's taxi driver and he pretends to be his driver. 
   It turns out that Dawson stole the money under false pretenses (What 
   they are is beyond me) and plans on keeping it all for himself. While 
   he is in the back seat of the taxi fondling the money between his 
   fingers, King gasses and kills<A HREF="death_is_nimble_death_is_quick_1966.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/death be nimble death be quick german poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   him, dumping his dead body off a bridge to the river below. Jo and 
   Tom learn of Dawson's treachery and try to stop him, not knowing that 
   he is already dead. Jo figures out what is going on (Damned if I know 
   how!) and both he and Tom save the day, defeating the Golden Cats and 
   making Ceylon safe once again for Babs.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    If it seems Babs is not in the film as much as she should be, it's 
   because actress Ann Smyrner caught a serious case of blood poisoning 
   in Ceylon and had to be hospitalized while the majority of the film 
   was being shot, forcing some major rewrites to the script. That may 
   be why this film is so confusing. There's is a lot of talk about a 
   &quot;Mr. Farrow&quot;, but we never see him, only hearing his voice 
   over the phone. He has a lot to do with the Golden Cats, but since we 
   never see him, his role in the plot seems moot. Director/screenwriter 
   Rudolf Zehetgruber (the German 'krimi&quot; <B><A HREF="black_cobra_1963.htm">THE

   [1971-1975]), who also has a small role in the film (using the name 
   &quot;Rolf Zehett&quot;), does what he can with his quickly rewritten 
   screenplay, tossing in a deadly plot about a &quot;bacteria bomb&quot;
    during the finale, but since it was never mentioned during the rest 
   of the film, it seems tacked-on. Still, both Tony Kendall and Brad 
   Harris have an easy-going chemistry that carries the film and Harris 
   has a standout karate fight with fellow bodybuilder (and peplum star) 
   Dan Vadis, which is the highlight of the film. There's also an 
   elephant stampede, a boat chase, a plane/car explosion and, in the 
   finale, a female elephant falls in love with Jo, proving him to be 
   irresistible to females of any species! It may not make much sense 
   but, like the other entries in the series, it is breezy entertainment 
   of the first degree, so check your brain at the door and enjoy!</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Governor and his two daughters are kidnapped by the evil Karamat and 
   his trigger-happy men. After a treacherous trek through the jungle, 
   Karamat and his prisoners finally arrive at his fortress, which is 
   heavily fortified with men with guns and a series of maze-like caves. 
   The government deems an air attack or a full-on ground assault too 
   dangerous, so they reform the Death Raiders, a small group of Black 
   Ops. soldiers headed by Captain Barone, to penetrate Karamat's 
   fortress and rescue the Governor and his daughters. So begins this 
   enjoyable (sometimes for the wrong reasons) action film from the 
   Philippines, as Captain Barone rounds-up all the ex-<A HREF="death_raiders_1984b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/death raiders vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="138" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>members

   and helping an alcoholic member free his girlfriend from a mafia 
   whorehouse. Meanwhile, Karamat's son, who disagrees with his father's 
   political views, unsuccessfully tries to lead the prisoners to 
   freedom. When Karamat catches him, he ties him up in the middle of 
   town and beats the stuffing oput of him with his bare hands in front 
   of all the citizens. This does not sit too well with Karamat's wife, 
   who secretly plans a revolution with a sympathetic rebel in town. 
   After Captain Barone and his men train to get into shape, they set 
   out on their mission to Karamat's stronghold. They make it to the 
   cave where the Governor and his daughters are being held and they get 
   an unexpected hand from Karamat's wife and son. From then on, the 
   group try to make it through the jungle to safety, before the Army 
   does a full air and ground attack on the compound. Members will be 
   lost on the way as Captain Barone and his men must fight an 
   inexhaustable supply of Karamat's soldiers, even as some of Barone's 
   men return to Karamat's compound to rescue innocent women and 
   children.&nbsp; Directed and co-written with a lot of intentional 
   humor (check out the disco and whorehouse scenes) by Segundo Ramos (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#DeadlyCommando">SUICIDE
    FORCE</A></B> - 1982), this film has a lot going for it (especially 
   the early martial arts fights, including an inventive, almost comic 
   book-like, use of a spinning bar stool), but stops dead in it's 
   tracks every time it goes back to the Karamat father-son conflict. 
   This film works best when it concentrates on the Death Raiders 
   themselves and their comradarie, which seems natural and unforced 
   (it's apparent these actors, including Johnny Wilson [<B><A HREF="#PayOrDie1979">DEVIL'S

   Regan&quot;, have worked together many times before this film). As 
   with most Filipino action films, this one contains more than a few 
   scenes of attempted rape (but, surprisingly, no nudity), including a 
   comical scene where a bunch of Karamat's soldiers fight each other in 
   the middle of a lake as they try to rape one of the Governor's 
   daughters. While most of the action in the latter-half of the film is 
   basically gunfights and explosions, the film has a kinetic energy 
   that's infectious and fun to watch. I was taken aback by the abrupt 
   ending, but that's a small complaint to an otherwise highly watchable 
   film and, at 80 minutes, it doesn't overstay it's welcome. Also

   gets a call from Elaine (Debbie Brooks), the wife of one of his 
   soldier buddies, telling him that her husband, Marty, died in a car 
   crash and she doesn't think it was an accident, so Deacon heads to 
   the town of King's Ransom to investigate. Once in town, Deacon meets 
   pretty gas station owner Audrey (future director Katt Shea) and 
   immediately runs in<A HREF="devastator_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/devastator vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>to
    Sheriff Clay Marsh (Kaz Garas), who warns Deacon that this town 
   doesn't tolerate strangers. Elaine tells Deacon that the town has 
   been taken over by a group of dastardly marijuana farmers and their 
   leader, John Carey (Crofton Hardester), is not above murder to 
   protect his crop. She believes Carey is responsible for Marty's 
   death. Deacon begins asking questions around town, but finds everyone 
   afraid to talk. While out on a date with Audrey, Carey and his men 
   force Deacon's car off the road and beat the shit out of him (Casey 
   also has the hots for Audrey). When Deacon doesn't take the hint to 
   leave town, a couple of Carey's men firebomb Elaine's house, killing 
   her (she burns to death in her bed), which results in Deacon chasing 
   the two goons in his car. Deacon's car flips over and explodes, so 
   Carey thinks Deacon is dead and his problems are over. In reality, 
   Deacon escaped the explosion and he's about to make Carey's life 
   miserable. Deacon contacts his old Nam buddies, electronics expert 
   Spenser (Terrence O'Hara), explosives expert Bartlett (Bill 
   McLaughlin) and insane muscleman Ox (Jack Daniels) and they head to 
   King's Ransom for some good, old-fashioned payback. Audrey puts them 
   up in a secret cabin in the woods, as Deacon and his squad 
   systematically begin to kill Carey's men and destroy the pot crop. As 
   more of his men end up missing, Carey's men capture Bartlett, hold 
   him in a cell at the Sheriff's office and beat the crap out of him, 
   but Deacon and his men pull a midnight rescue and save Bartlett. 
   Carey kidnaps Audrey (and blows up her gas station) and uses her as 
   bait. The finale finds Deacon, his men and Sheriff Marsh (who finally 
   comes to his senses) battling Carey and his gang while trying save 
   Audrey and blowing up a dam to flood the pot crop. Not everyone (both 
   good and bad) will make it out alive.&nbsp; This is another one of 
   Filipino director/producer Cirio H. Santiago's long line of 80's 
   actioners and it's a pretty good little B-film. Even though it 
   recycles some of the same locations and footage used in Santiago's

    different films which can still be enjoyed if watched back-to-back. 
   There are some similarities, namely Kaz Garas as a small-town sheriff 
   that's neither good or bad (he tries to do his job in both films, 
   even though he knows there's corruption all around him) and both

   here), he was capable of turning out some entertaining low-budget 
   flicks. It's no wonder Roger Corman funded many of his films, because 
   Santiago knew how to stretch a buck to the breaking point, yet he 
   could still deliver interesting, if unoriginal, product. The script

   bunch of goons sent by the &quot;Landlord&quot; enter the home of 
   Peter and demand $30,000 from him or else he and his family will have 
   to leave. When Peter refuses, the goons beat him, tie him up, shoot

   and kill both of them, too, before setting fire to their home. The 
   entire atrocity was witnessed by a young girl, who leaves town and 
   doesn't return until years later, the faces of all of Peter's 
   murderers etched into her memory. Local hotheaded man Richard (Sombat 
   Methanee; who starred in <B><A HREF="#KillerElephants">THE KILLER ELEPHANTS</A></B> 
   [1976] using the name &quot;Sung Pa&quot;) can plainly see that

    prices by Mrs. Chaw, who Richard believes is the &quot;Landlord&quot;
    behind the killings, both past and present. Richard cannot get 
   anyone in town to believe his story, because Mrs. Chaw is 
   well-respected around town and the only law in the territory, Deputy 
   Sheriff John, seems to be in Mrs. Chaw's pocket. Richard becomes 
   romantically involved with pretty young schoolteacher Catherine 
   (Alana Montri), while he secretly murders the goons under Mrs. Chaw's 
   control. Richard also helps Kenneth (Clint Chit) run for election for 
   parliament against Mrs. Chaw, which doesn't sit too well with Mrs. 
   Chaw, who orders her men to kill Kenneth and Richard. As more of her 
   men end up dead by Richard's hands, Mrs. Chaw becomes convinced that 
   there is a spy amongst them. When the goons kill Richard's father in 
   front of Richard, his sister Molly and Kenneth (<B>Kenneth:</B> 
   &quot;You're upset.&quot;&nbsp; <B>Richard:</B> &quot;Of course so,

   especially after Catherine's step-sister is raped and her step-father 
   is murdered. When it is revealed that the young girl that witnessed 
   the death of Peter and his family is none other than Catherine (who 
   is Peter's daughter), she joins Richard and Kenneth in ridding the 
   town of Mrs. Chaw and her rape-hungry hoods.&nbsp; Badly dubbed and 
   bloody as hell, <B>DIRTY HEROES</B> (Don't look for this title on 
   IMDB or any other review site) is enjoyable nonsense if you put your 
   brain in neutral and let your thought processes coast downhill.

    FIGHTING</A></B> [1976] using the name &quot;Vichien 
   Sa-Nguanthai&quot;) and screenwriter Prasa Somchai toss in numerous 
   gunfights and sleazy sequences to go along with the political 
   intrigue and revenge-driven storyline. What is truly remarkable is 
   how the sleazy scenes involving rape and sex manage to avoid any 
   female nudity at all, yet there is no problem showing the penis of 
   Peter's young son just before he is mercilessly blown away!&nbsp; The 
   violence on display is mainly of the bullet type, as people are shot 
   in the head, torso, arms, legs and back. Mrs. Chaw also whips 
   underling Suzy repeatedly across her naked back with a bamboo cane 
   and then orders her goons to &quot;rape her until she dies&quot; when 
   she believes Suzy is the spy, which she isn't (Mrs. Chaw, who is 
   probably a lesbian [look at the way she dresses], believes that all 
   women who don't see eye-to-eye with her should be raped until they 
   are dead!). The finale, where Catherine chases Mrs. Chaw, who is 
   throwing grenades back at her (!) in a lumberyard, is one of those 
   &quot;What The Fuck?!?&quot; sequences in Asian films that ends with 
   Mrs. Chaw getting shot in the stomach and falling on one of her live 
   grenades, blowing herself to smithereens. Toss in some of the most 
   awkward romantic dialogue I have ever heard (Clearly, the Australians 
   who provide the cheesy English dubbing were making it up on the spot) 
   and what you end up with is a frenetic, over-the-top sleazefest that 
   should satisfy fans of Far East weirdness. Also starring Krung 
   Seller, Prichela Lee, Boosith, Viboonlarp, and Ceceil Quinn. Never 
   released on home video in the U.S.; the print I viewed was sourced 
   from a British VHS tape. Notorious producer/director Joseph Lai and 
   his IFD Films got his hands on this, did his regular hack job, added 
   fake names to the cast and credited the director as &quot;Bo 
   Curtis&quot; (the British VHS artwork &quot;borrows&quot; an iconic

    TAGS</A><A NAME="DogTags1985"></A> (1985) -</B> In this well-done 
   Vietnam War actioner, real-life reporter Chris Hilton tries to find 
   out the truth behind a story about a downed chopper that supposedly 
   contained four cases of top-secret American military documents. The 
   only problem is, it is now 1985 and Hilton has to head back to 
   Southeast Asia to interview people who witnessed the events when they 
   happened in the early 70's. He finds a Vietnamese villager who was 
   there when it happened and, as Hilton starts recording his words, we 
   are whisked back in time to a story that involves a Ranger Unit, 
   American P.O.W.s and a German freelance photographer. The story 
   begins with Ranger Cecil (Clive Wood) saving a bunch of American 
   P.O.W.s, including Pete (Jim Gaines) and Eddy (Robert Marius), along 
   with German photographer Willy (Robert Haufrect), from an enemy war 
   camp and heading up-river in a canoe. Cecil's commanding officer, 
   Captain Newport (Mike Monty), wants Cecil and his &quot;zombies&quot; 
   to retrieve the missing documents from the downed chopper, even 
   though most of the P.O.W.s are malnourished and weak (When one of 
   Captain <A HREF="dog_tags_1985b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dogtags vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="201" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Newport's
    underlings questions the reasoning for sending a bunch of battered 
   men on such a dangerous mission, the Captain replies, &quot;Calm 
   down. This is a war, no vacation!&quot;). Cecil can't believe his 
   ears when he hears his new orders, especially since he'll have to 
   lead all the weak men (some seriously injured from the torture they 
   endured at the hands of the enemy) through ten miles of booby 
   trapped, enemy-infested jungle to get to the downed chopper. Almost 
   immediately, P.O.W. &quot;Ox&quot; Oxford (Keith Craig) is killed by 
   a spiked booby trap and P.O.W. Glass (Peter Ehlich; also the Dialogue 
   Coach here) is killed by his own men when he falters in killing a 
   female gook who is laying more booby traps (He does manage to cut 
   into her shoulder blade with a machete, but another P.O.W. has to 
   finish her off). Pete goes jungle crazy, starts yammering 
   incoherently and runs off into the jungle, where he steps on a land 
   mine and is blown to bits. By the time Cecil makes it to the downed 
   chopper (which is lying in a shallow lake next to a waterfall), only 
   two other are left alive, Eddy and a badly injured Ron (Baird 
   Stafford), whose leg was impaled on bamboo spikes while swimming in a 
   river. Clive and Eddy retrieve the four cases out of the chopper, but 
   instead of finding top-secret documents, they find all the cases are 
   filled with small gold bars instead. Smelling a rat in Captain 
   Newport (and rightfully so) and fearing that they will be killed if 
   they radio-in their location, Clive, Eddy and Ron devise a plan to 
   escape to safety with the gold. They find a sympathetic Vietnamese 
   family to take them in (where Ron has his leg amputated), but Captain 
   Newport makes sure there is no way they will ever settle down (he has 
   a transmitter in one of the cases). The finale finds Clive and Eddy 
   removing their dog tags and never being seen or heard from again. The 
   only proof of their existence are their dog tags, some photos and a 
   single bar of gold kept in a box by the villager reporter Chris 
   Hilton is now interviewing. Better acted and photographed than most 
   Italian war actioners (this was filmed in the Philippines), thanks to 
   sharp direction and an intelligent screenplay by Romano Scavolini (<B><A HREF="nightmare_1981.htm">NIGHTMARE</A></B>

   the genre (bullet-ridden bodies; fiery explosions; blood-gushing 
   wounds; various booby trap impalements and a gory leg amputation that 
   will have you squirming in your seat), but it also contains a lot of 
   human pathos, which is highly unusual in these types of films. You 
   actually care what happens to these people and there are some 
   knockout set pieces on display, such as a young Vietnamese woman, 
   Mina (Gigi Duenas), who makes love to a recently legless Ron (just to 
   let him know he is no less of a man for losing a limb) or the 
   revelation that the young woman's younger brother, Tanoy (Jericho 
   Ondevilla), may actually be the enemy (He says to Cecil, &quot;Me not 
   Charley!&quot; to which Cecil responds, &quot;C'mon, boys like you 
   aren't innocent anymore!&quot;). That boy turns out to be the 
   villager that reporter Chris Hilton is interviewing over ten years 
   later. Filmed in three acts, with a prologue and an epilogue, <B>DOG TAGS</B> 
   is a literate, if extremely bloody, example on how to make a war film 
   with heart and a limited budget. Worth your time if you are a fan to 
   this genre. Also starring Adolfo Arorong, David Light, Dave Anderson 
   and a cameo by the late Nick Nicholson. Romano Kristoff (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Ninja'sForce">NINJA'S

   Alex Gatelee (director Michel Qissi) and he has done something very,

   travel to Beverly Hills to kill Marsales and retrieve the gold, but 
   Marsales escapes and Gatelee ends up getting slashed across his face

   are unaware that Fetz's girlfriend, Myra (Ashley Hayden), is on 
   Gatelee's payroll and she uses her inside knowledge to assist Gatelee 
   in trying to locate his missing gold (She tries to seduce Jay to give 
   up the location of the gold, but he rebuffs her naked advances by 
   saying, &quot;I don't sleep with snakes!&quot;), Meanwhile, Julie has 
   escaped from Gatelee's jungle compound and, together with fellow 
   captive Lianna (Kimberleigh Stark), must run a gauntlet of Gatelee's 
   fighters and assassins as they try to make it to safety. Charlie 
   brings Jay to his sister's house to question her about Gatelee's 
   business since she use to work for him until he manually removed one 
   of her eyes when she spurned his advances. Her information proves 
   invaluable to Jay, who is now able to definitely connect Myra with 
   Gatelee. Myra is able to sneak into Marsales' jail cell and tricks 
   him into revealing the location of the gold. Myra double-crosses 
   Gatelee and steals the gold for herself, which sets up the finale 
   where everyone gathers together on the island where the gold is

   guy/girl. While not especially bloody, the fight scenes are well 
   choreographed and exciting (thanks to Qissi) and Gatelee meets a 
   memorable demise. While also lacking in the nudity department, 
   Sheperd does look fetching in the tight black outfit she wears 
   through the majority of the film and there's some humor, too, 
   especially Gatelee's &quot;Apology accepted!&quot; remark and action 
   accompanying it after one of his main goons expresses his sorrow for 
   letting Julie get away. <B>ELIMINATOR WOMAN</B> is a lot better than

   Malanga a &quot;nigger&quot;, which pisses off Josh until Malanga 
   reminds him that in Africa &quot;nigger is a nice word.&quot;!?!) and 
   that Malanga lost a sister in the same area years earlier. That

   next morning, the group travel further down the river and pick up

   Steiger with a poison dart (When Malanga informs Steiger that the 
   poison will make him fall asleep and die, Steiger says, &quot;Die? I

   natives and brought to their village after Gordon shoots and kills

   their way back to civilization?&nbsp; This South African-lensed 
   jungle action film, directed by Elmo De Witt, mixes standard jungle 
   warfare (guns vs. primitive weapons, where the poison darts and 
   arrows beat the guns nearly every time) with some of the worst 
   crocodile attacks ever committed to film. While we are treated to 
   some nice nature photography of real crocodiles in their natural 
   habitat, it's quite obvious that when the attacks happen, some lousy 
   looking fake rubber stunt crocodiles are used. Vernon Wells (<B><A HREF="road_warrior_1982.htm">THE

    A secret society of police officers, which practice vigilante 
   justice, are on the loose in Italy, much to the consternation of 
   Police Commissioner Bertone (an excellent Enrico Maria Salerno; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BirdCrystalPlum1970">THE
    BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE</A></B> - 1970). The early-to-mid-'70s 
   were a tough time for Italian law enforcement, due to new laws that 
   were passed that favored the criminals over their victims, so much so 
   that the police are blamed for every little thing that goes wrong and 
   the public (and Press) begin to turn against them. Commissioner 
   Bertone's girlfriend, Sandra (Mariangelo Melato; <B><A HREF="flash_gordon_1980.htm">FLASH
    GORDON</A></B> - 1980) is a newspaper reporter and she tries to 
   defend her boyfriend, but she is losing the battle. Having had 
   enough, Bertone takes members of the Press on a bus and tours Rome at 
   night, showing them how prostitution (including transvestites!) leads 
   to blackmail and even murder, but it doesn't impress the Press, who 
   continue to write biased stories against him (even though Bertone 
   tells them that less than 10% of the arrests ever go to trial and get 
   a guilty verdict). Bertone is working on a case where two men on a 
   motorcycle pull off a brazen jewelry store robbery, shooting and 
   killing the worker inside and also killing a bystander outside who 
   tries to stop them from leaving the scene of the crime. Mario 
   Staderini (Piero Tiberi; <B><A HREF="from_corleone_to_brooklyn_1978.htm">FROM

   since he was his favorite target. The members of Bertone's team begin 
   to admire the Clean-up Squad, as they are able to punish the guilty 
   without going to court, which pisses-off Bertone, telling his team

   him that Michel wishes to turn himself in, but only to Bertone with 
   no other police involvement. The Commissioner picks up Michel and 
   goes to drive him back to the department, only the Clean-up Squad 
   contacts Bertone over his police radio and demands that he turn over 
   Michel to them. They have nothing against the Commissioner, they just 
   want Michel. Bertone refuses, which leads to a shoot-out, where 
   Michel is shot and wounded in the leg. Bertone hands over Michel to 
   A.D.A. Ricciuti and tells him he is handing in his resignation 
   tomorrow morning.&nbsp; Bertone realizes that his friend, former 
   Police Commissioner Stolfi (Cyril Cusack<B>; <A HREF="#Manhunt1972">MANHUNT</A></B>

   to expose him to the Press at a conference tomorrow morning, but in 
   the meantime he is under arrest. As he is about to slap the cuffs on 
   Stolfi, a member of the Clean-up Squad shoots Bertone several times, 
   killing him. We then discover that people in high places are members 
   of the Clean-up Squad, including the Commissioner's partner, 
   Santalamenti (Ezio Sancrotti; <B><A HREF="#ViolentProfession73">THE 
   VIOLENT PROFESSIONALS</A></B> - 1973), but not A.D.A. Ricciuti, who 
   is warned by a high ranking official to stop investigating the 
   Commissioner's death, telling him that a Clean-up Squad doesn't exist 
   (telling him in such a way as to imply he will be killed, too, if he 
   digs any deeper). The film ends with A.D.A. Ricciuti telling Stolfi 
   that he need to question him tomorrow morning at his office. Was 
   Bertone's death all for naught or has the A.D.A. grown a backbone? 
   The answer depends on the viewer to make that decision.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Movies (starring Bud Spencer), until his death in 1988 (In my 
   defense, most of his movies are comedies and I do not review that 
   genre unless they are a mixture of other genres). If his name doesn't 
   look familiar, it is because he usually took the pseudonym 
   &quot;Steno&quot; when directing or writing (he co-wrote this film 
   with Lucio De Caro; Steno's <B><A HREF="knock_out_cop_1973.htm">THE 
   KNOCK OUT COP</A></B> - 1973; <B><A HREF="44_specialist_1976.htm">THE 
   .44 SPECIALIST</A></B> - 1976), but he uses his given name here as 
   director. There's also an <A HREF="execution_squad_1972.htm#StelvioCipriani">excellent
    music score by</A> the late <A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_3.htm#StelvioCipriani">Stelvio
    Cipriani</A>, full of booming violins and guitar crescendos. There's 
   not much action in this film, but it doesn't need it, because it is 
   more of a personal drama than an action flick, full of little scenes 
   that make it stand out from most Eurocrime films, such as the 
   conversation that Bertone has with Sandra over dinner at a 
   restaurant, neither of them able to put their jobs aside and have an 
   intimate personal conversation, even though it is obvious that they 
   care for each other. The political climate in Italy during the time 
   this film was made is comparable to New York City during the same 
   time period, when crime was rampant and the police force, or should I 
   say, the majority of the police force, was involved heavily in graft 
   and lawlessness, where police used violence against criminals in 
   order to put them away. That same attitude against the police is 
   prevalent today, but I have to laugh every time someone accuses the 
   police of using violence against &quot;innocent, law-abiding&quot; 
   people. I laugh only because those people who accuse police of using 
   violence have no idea how bad it actually was during the '70s. If 
   they did, I can guarantee that they would keep their big traps shut. 
   This film treats that system with the bile it deserves, because if 
   you treat criminals with kid gloves, what do you expect their victims 
   to do? This film displays that hatred for everything that is lawful 
   with the respect it deserves, nothing more, nothing less.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Sheriff Jack is a crack shot, as we witness him shooting three

   force when he saw his partner shot in the head (he still has 
   nightmares about it) and moved to this small town to get away from 
   the action and violence. Bad move. It's not long before Jack and 
   Nelson are butting heads, but both Jessup and money-hungry (but 
   clueless) Mayor Ankers (Anthony East) interfere with Jack's duty as 
   sheriff. One night, a bunch of Nelson's men break Jack's gun hand 
   with a two-by-four, pour booze down his throat (Jack is a recovering 
   alcoholic) and then loot the town. Mayor Ankers fires Jack for being 
   drunk on duty, but when Colonel Harper shows up in town and he spots 
   Nelson's men kidnapping Cowboy, Jack and Harper join forces to free 
   Cowboy and bring Nelson and Jessup down. When Cowboy dies in a manner 
   similar to Jack's old partner, Jack goes on a one-man killing spree 
   to get revenge. He's no longer a cop, so all the rules go out the 
   window. Pray for the bad guys, especially in the unbelievable final 
   scene where Jack blows up a huge cargo plane with just three shots of

   nothing spectacular, <B>FAST GUN</B> does move at a fast clip and, 
   besides some gaping plot holes (How does Jack's hand manage to heal

   on action set-pieces rather than plot. Scripters (and long-time 
   Santiago collaborators) Joe Mari Avellana and Frederick Bailey never 
   even try to explain why our own government is stealing weapons from 
   their own armories (I racked my brain for an explanation and all I 
   got was a splitting headache). Instead, they just layer-on one

   Nelson's goons (including Santiago regular Nick Nicholson), who are 
   armed with automatic weapons and rocket launchers. If you have ever 
   watched a Santiago film, you know he excels when it comes to action 
   sequences. This is just like most of Santiago's 80's output: Take off

    VACATION</A><A NAME="FatalVacation"></A> (1989) -</B> Here's a Hong 
   Kong production (from Golden Harvest) that's sure to make anyone 
   think twice about vacationing in the Philippines. As a matter of 
   fact, it's bound to make any Filipino that watches it to pick up a 
   gun and shoot the next Chinaman they see in the head just for spite. 
   The story is simple: A tour group, consisting of a group of diverse 
   Hong Kong residents, including grandparents and their grandson; a cop 
   and his horny brother; identical twin brothers (complete with 
   matching bushy moustaches!); a husband who leaves his pregnant wife 
   at home (Her last words to him are, &quot;Honey, don't go to the 
   prostitutes. AIDS is fatal!&quot;); a guy who likes to wear his Rolex 
   on weird parts of his body (like his foot); and various other 
   goofballs, take a bus trip through the Philippines with tour guy Bud 
   (director/producer Eric Tsang), his dwarf sidekick Rainman (What's a 
   Filipino flick without a midget?) and Candy (Irene Wan). Candy 
   believes some of the tourists on board are Triad members, which 
   worries her because there's a strong military presence everywhere on 
   their route, but Bud tells her to supply the Triad members with 
   &quot;cannabis, strip shows and hookers&quot; and everything will be 
   alright. Yeah, right! After making a few stops to do<A HREF="fatal_vacation_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/fatal vacation dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="227" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   the things that tourists do (take photos, buy souvenirs, etc.), 
   circumstances take a considerable turn for the worse when cops raid a 
   bar close to where the tourists are having dinner (and watching and 
   participating a hula show!), where rebel leader Sam (Bernardo 
   Bernardo)is buying an illegal shipment of automatic weapons. This 
   leads to a massive stunt-filled shootout between the rebels and the 
   cops that eventually leads to the rebels hijacking the bus and taking 
   the tourists hostage (thankfully, Rainman stays behind) so they can 
   make their getaway. After shooting one of the tourists in the head to 
   prove they mean business, the rebels drive the bus to a village in 
   the jungle, where they offer to trade the tourists to the Philippines 
   government in exchange for the release of Sam's prisoner brother Eric 
   (Spanky Manikan). Of course, nothing goes according to plan, so the 
   tourists must come to depend on each other to plan and execute their 
   escape, as some of the tourists are raped, tortured or killed by 
   their captors. The finale illustrates that even unassuming common 
   people are capable of acts of uncommon bravery and self-sacrifice if 
   pushed too far. Expect lots of gun battles, explosions (including 
   exploding bodies) and blood.&nbsp; Director/producer/star Eric Tsang (<B><A HREF="#MadMission">MAD

   - 1993), working with a screenplay by Nam Yin (<B><A HREF="prison_on_fire_1987.htm">PRISON
    ON FIRE</A></B> - 1987), offers an uneasy mix of comedy and brutal 
   violence, yet he seems to make it work. The comedy comes mainly in 
   the beginning, such as when the tourists take advantage of two 
   Filipino soldiers, buying everything they own except their underwear 
   and rifles, only for the viewer to discover that the soldiers do this 
   every time tourists stop there (and make a bundle of money each 
   time). Once the hostage situation happens, the comedy abruptly ends 
   and it becomes a tense and bloody standoff between the rebels and the 
   Filipino government (all it's members speak English), with the 
   tourists painfully in the middle. Graphic scenes of rape and death 
   follow, including an incredibly nerve wracking scene where Bud is 
   forced by rebel leader Sam to play a game of Russian Roulette with 
   the rest of the tourists' lives that ends with the identical twin 
   brothers sacrificing their lives for the good of the others (How they 
   chose to die is truly memorable in a twisted, brotherly way). It's 
   Bud and Candy who are the invisible glue that holds the group 
   together. Bud (it reads &quot;Bud&quot; on the English subtitles, but 
   it sounds like they are calling him &quot;Bob&quot; on the Cantonese 
   soundtrack) makes it his duty to convince his charges that things are 
   much better than they actually are once they are taken hostage (he 
   eats a plate of rancid food with a smile on his face), while Candy 
   offers herself as the next rape victim of a bald-headed rebel when he 
   originally choses another woman from the group. They both go into 
   full hero mode in the exciting and bloody finale, but, along the way, 
   Tsang manages to get in some sharp barbs on subjects like TV news 
   reporting, the Chinese takeover of Hong Kong in 1997, government 
   cover-ups and self-sacrifice. While this will never be endorsed by 
   the Philippines Tourism Board, <B>FATAL VACATION</B> offers a wealth

   Ross) is trapped behind enemy lines when his Phantom jet is shot down 
   and he is forced to parachute into the Vietnam jungle. While VC 
   soldiers are nipping at Major Wilson's heels, General Corman (David 
   Carradine), assigns Sgt. Duncan (Eb Lottimer; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Lords Deep">LORDS

   (Henry Strzalkowski), Jimmy-T (Don Barnes), Senator (Scott Utley) and 
   Jeff (Tonichi Fructoso) to rescue Major Wilson before he is captured 
   and reveals government secrets. General Corman sends his aide, Lt. 
   Reynolds (David Anthony Smith), a wise-ass fighter pilot, to assist 
   Sgt. Duncan on the mission. The enemy sends a special force, led by 
   Captain Phat (Joe Mari Avellana), who had a previous run-in with Sgt. 
   Duncan and his men (Duncan killed a General that Phat was 
   protecting), to capture Major Wilson before he is rescued. The enemy 
   also seems to have knowledge of Sgt. Duncan's arrival in the jungle, 
   like someone on our side is passing them information. This makes it 
   very difficult for Sgt. Duncan's squad, who rescue an injured Major 
   Wilson, but are dogged at every step by Captain Phat and his 
   black-clad special forces. It also doesn't help that Lt. Reynolds is 
   a major fuck-up, who at one point wears <A HREF="field_of_fire_1992.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/field of fire vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="268" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>mirrored
    sunglasses while walking through the jungle. This alerts the enemy 
   on their position when they see the rays of the sun reflected off the 
   mirrored lenses. With bad weather on the way that make rescue by 
   helicopter impossible, Sgt. Duncan and his men must traverse the 
   jungle on foot until they get to the next pick-up point miles away. 
   That's easier said than done, because Major Wilson is developing a 
   case of &quot;jungle rot&quot; in his leg wound and it's obvious that 
   someone is sabotaging their every move, as supplies in their 
   backpacks end up missing and their radio is tampered with. With every 
   battle that Duncan and his men engage in, they lose another member. 
   General Corman becomes highly suspicious of Duncan's unlikely series 
   of misfortunes and roots-out the traitor, who is not a member of the 
   trapped squad, but a member of his own staff. The finale finds 
   Duncan, Reynolds and Senator, the only squad members left alive, 
   trying to protect Major Wilson while Captain Phat and his special 
   forces lead one final all-out assault. Can General Corman save them 
   in time?&nbsp; This is director Cirio H. Santiago's first in a series 
   of 90's Vietnam War action films, following a string of 80's war 
   actioners, which included <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#EyeOfTheEagle">EYE

    ANGELS</A></B> (1988). If you enjoyed any of those films, you'll 
   probably like this one, too. The script, by Thomas McKelvey Cleaver 
   (Santiago's <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#DuneWarriors">DUNE WARRIORS</A></B> 
   - 1990; also starring David Carradine), is basically nothing but a 
   series of action set-pieces, where Duncan and his squad get in 
   numerous firefights, objects and people blow up real good and so many 
   enemy soldiers are stabbed, it's hard to keep count. That's not to 
   say that the film is not without humor, though. There's a funny bit 
   in the beginning where Duncan's squad gross-out a bunch of 
   wet-behind-the-ears new recruits by eating a box-full of enemy 
   &quot;ears&quot; (they're actually canned peaches), only to have 
   Duncan stroll by and accidentally eat the real stunt ear (it's quite 
   funny) and this touching bit of dialogue that Duncan delivers to his 
   squad when member Hawk is killed: &quot;You guys just remember one 
   thing. Hawk bought it because he was showing off. Now I don't want 
   any more of you guys dying on me, you understand? Because I take that 
   shit personal......Now get over here and eat your lizard!&quot; Even 
   though David Carradine is top-billed, he appears for less than five 
   minutes throughout the film, but then he shows up in the finale and 
   plays a major role in saving Duncan, Reynolds and Wilson. You at 
   first think that Carradibe is doing one of his patented B-movie 
   walk-on roles, but he actually plays the action hero in the end, 
   jumping out of helicopters and laying down ground fire so everyone 
   can escape. His character, General Corman, is an in-joke to Roger 
   Corman, who bankrolled the majority of Santiago's films, including 
   this one. If you like war films with more braun than brains, <B>FIELD

   fighting. This all leads to the big final fight, where Mr. Pinai 
   forces Ryan to throw the fight against undefeated Jet (Benny 
   Urquidez, who also starred with Norton in <B><A HREF="#ForceFive1981">FORCE:
    FIVE</A></B> - 1981) or else he will kill Katie. Ryan gets some 
   unexpected help from blind street beggar Wan (Nello Nayo), who is 
   actually a martial arts master that teaches Ryan the finer points of 
   fighting (as well as humility and patience), skills Ryan will need to 
   defeat Jet and get even for his parents' deaths.&nbsp; This Filipino 
   martial arts actioner, directed/produced by Anthony Maharaj (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#CrossFire1987">CROSS

   - 1987, both starring Norton and Guerrero) and written by Noah 
   Blough, is a cheap, by-the-numbers &quot;underdog meets undefeated 
   fighter in the ring&quot; potboiler that offers no surprises (C'mon 
   now, fighting to pay for your sister's life-saving operation? How old 
   is that chestnut?) and even makes the fighting scenes look boring. 
   This scenario was done to death even back in 1988 and if it weren't 
   for the presence of Richard Norton and Franco Guerrero (who is wasted 
   here in a thankless role), this film (also known as <B><A HREF="kick_fighter_1988.htm">KICK
    FIGHTER</A></B>) would be nearly unwatchable. It's lazily filmed, 
   has sound that seems to have been recorded through a tin can and has 
   sets as threadbare as any porno film. It also has the prerequisite 
   master/student training montage, a totally out-of-place sequence in a 
   bowling alley (I'm going to have to do a list where bowling alleys 
   are used for no reason in genre films. I can think of at least a 
   dozen off the top of my head.) and an unbelievable disclaimer in the 
   finale that states that although Benny Urquidez was defeated in this 
   film, in real life he is an undefeated fighter and this film is 
   dedicated to all those that fought Urquidez and lost, but wish they 
   won! I can only imagine that this disclaimer was put there at 
   Urquidez's request to stroke his ego. This entire film screams 
   amateur hour and is one of the weaker examples of Filipino action 
   cinema. You've seen it all done a hundred times before and better 
   than this. American expatriate actor Bill Baldridge (<B><A HREF="#POWDeathcamp">POW

   U.S. military base and fence it to a man called &quot;The 
   Chinaman&quot; (Vic Diaz) for a large sum of cash. Morelli and McGee

    While Morelli and McGee establish themselves as heads of a criminal 
   empire in Los Angeles, Russell washes-up on-shore on an uncharted 
   island occupied by two Japanese soldiers (Joe Mari Avellana and 
   Joonie Gamboa) that have been stranded there since World War II. They 
   nurse Russell back to health and teach him the way of the samurai. 
   Meanwhile, back in the States, McGee moves in on Russell's wife Jayne 
   (Jayne Kennedy) and young son Jimmy (played by James Iglehart's 
   real-life son). Jayne wants nothing to do with McGee, so he 
   interferes in her life, getting her fired from her job as a lounge 
   singer and making sure she can't get another job in any of the other 
   nightclubs around town. Broke and penniless, Jayne is forced to move 
   in with one of her girlfriends, while McGee and Morelli cut a bloody 
   path throughout L.A. trying to wrestle control of all the organized 
   crime activity. Russell is eventually rescued by some American 
   soldiers and he returns to L.A. to look for his wife, but he finds 
   his house empty and up for sale. After finding out about McGee's 
   treachery with his wife, Russell begins murdering all of McGee and 
   Morelli's men with a samurai sword while searching for his wife. Not 
   knowing that it is Russell who is killing their men (they still think 
   he is dead), Morelli and McGee hire some outside muscle to fix their 
   problem. Russell finally finds his wife and when he sets eyes on his 
   young son for the first time, he puts his revenge plans on hold just 
   long enough to make sweet love to his wife and play with his son in 
   the park. Russell then gets back to work, killing the outside muscle, 
   cutting off Morelli's head and delivering it to McGee (who is missing 
   an ear, thanks to an earlier run-in with Russell) in a box. McGee 
   retaliates by kidnapping Jayne and Jimmy and bringing them to his 
   heavily-guarded house in Mexico. Russell shows up, chops-off a few 
   heads and slices into McGee's stomach with his samurai sword in the 
   film's finale. Ah, good-old Nip know-how saves the day!&nbsp;

    the top-lined star here. There is fun to be had, especially the 
   interaction between the two Japanese soldiers, who have been living 
   alone together for so long on the island, they act more like an old 
   married couple rather than soldiers. When Russell suddenly appears on 
   the beach, you can see the jealousy in the eyes of the less-dominate 
   soldier (Gamboa). When he accidentally dies after falling out of a 
   coconut tree, you can view the hurt in the face of his long-standing 
   partner (Avellana). When Russell gets rescued, the lone Japanese 
   soldier chooses to stay behind (he even manages to kill one of the 
   American soldiers in rememberance of the good old days) rather than 
   face the new world. This section of the film is my favorite, as the 
   rest of the film is standard gangster and revenge stuff. The first 
   section of the film details the exploits of Morelli and McGee, as 
   they slaughter a mob hangout with machinegun fire and then kill a mob 
   bigshot and his men in an auto junkyard. The final third of the film 
   is Russell's revenge spree. He slices and kicks his way through a 
   cast of stuntmen until he gets even with Morelli and McGee. This 
   contains all the regular Santiago trademarks: Bloody bullet squibs, 
   numerous martial arts fights and a touch of gore, including Morelli's 
   head in a box and a few pretty good decapitations in the finale. 
   Jayne Kennedy also has a brief nude scene and delivers the film's 
   best line. When McGee offers to be Jimmy's new daddy, she looks at 
   him and says, &quot;He don't need a mother like you to be his

   to Caddo County, Texas to film some stunt scenes for his newest 
   picture and runs smack-dab into a child kidnapping ring. Kelly's 
   stuntmen friends Smilie (scripter Jordan Williams) and Mark (Brett 
   Rice) join Kelly for a night on the town and meet local girls Annie 
   (Deborah Morehart) and Lou Ann (Carla DeLane) and also meet Sheriff

   that happened ten years earlier. Mark warns stunt co-ordinator<A HREF="final_cut_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/final cut 1985 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Wes (T.J. Kennedy) not to trust the sheriff but will not explain why. 
   A little boy goes missing from the hotel the film crew is staying at, 
   which upsets Mark. Kelly starts up a romantic relationship with Lou 
   Ann (who is the sheriff's stepdaughter) and Smilie does the same with 
   Annie. The sheriff has his two hot-headed deputies, Deacon (Wes 
   Foreshaw) and Carter (S.W. Miller), keep a close eye on the foursome. 
   The sheriff corners Mark behind the bar, where we learn that Mark 
   sold his girlfriend's son to the sheriff ten years ago. The sheriff 
   has a lucrative side business where he and his men kidnap children 
   and sell them to the highest bidder. Deacon and Carter knock out 
   Smilie and Deacon rapes Annie. The sheriff then holds them captive in 
   a cabin in the woods until he can figure out what to do with them. 
   Kelly and Lou Ann arrive at Annie's house and find the door busted 
   and a piece of Smilie's front tooth in a puddle of blood on the floor 
   (which Carter broke off with pliers so he couldn't be called 
   &quot;Smilie&quot; any more). When Wes is shot in the back and killed 
   when he gets too close to the children's hideout, Kelly says enough 
   is enough and tries to rescue Smilie and Annie. Marks ends up getting 
   killed trying to save Kelly and Smilie. Kelly and his fellow stuntmen 
   band together to rescue the group of stolen children the sheriff is 
   holding hostage in a shack the deep woods. With a rocket boat and a 
   machine gun at his disposal, Kelly makes mincemeat of the sheriff's 
   men. One of the sheriff's &quot;children&quot; ends Thompson's 
   wretched life with a bullet in his back. This is mainly a showcase 
   for some pretty good stunts (an airplane lands on a moving tractor 
   trailer, the opening motorcycle/car chase and the rocket boat jump) 
   with a dash of mystery and social commentary thrown in for good 
   measure. Director/producer Larry G. Brown (<B><A HREF="pink_angels_1971.htm">THE
    PINK ANGELS</A></B> - 1971) uses the rural locations to good effect 
   as cars race through dirt roads and crash through shacks and the 
   river scenes where the rocket boat roars through the water are filmed 
   with maximum impact. Things start relatively tame but, from the 
   moment when Annie gets raped and Smilie has amateur dentistry 
   performed on his front teeth, things get somewhat nasty. Brown 
   treaded similar ground with his earlier <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Psychopath">PSYCHOPATH</A></B> 
   (1973), where children are the focal point in an otherwise unrelated 
   plot. <B><A HREF="final_cut_1985b.htm">FINAL CUT</A></B> is a 
   decently acted action film that manages to hold your attention thanks 
   to the natural interaction between the cast (you believe that Smilie, 
   Kelly and Mark have known each other for years). One funny running 
   gag concerns a double-jointed Smilie copping pain pills from an 
   apprehensive film doctor, each time telling him, &quot;This is the 
   last time, I promise.&quot; Actress Deborah Morehart would later 
   change her name to Hunter Tylo and appear in soap operas. A <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Vidmark">Vidmark

    goons invade the birthday party of Brown's son Johnny (Dad is away 
   at the store buying his son a toy gun at the time!), where they kill 
   the help, shoot little Johnny in the back and gang-rape Brown's wife 
   (One of the thugs says, &quot;Wanna see what I got in my pocket? as 
   he rapes her!), before shooting and killing her too. When Brown comes 
   home and sees the carnage, he vows revenge and, boy, does he get it! 
   After cornering one of Hawk's thugs and getting the names of the four 
   goons who killed his son and raped his wife, Brown goes off with list 
   in hand looking to do some major damage. Each of the four goons has 
   their own gang, so it's a non-stop barrage of fighting, gunfights and 
   explosions as Brown snaps necks, stabs, shoots and blows-up anyone 
   and anything that gets in his way. He saves the best kills for the 
   four thugs. One gets an axe planted in his back. Another gets shot in 
   the balls and, as he is pleading for his life, Brown puts a bullet 
   between his eyes. The third is blown-up by a grenade while trapped in 
   his overturned car. The fourth one is tied to a chair, has both of 
   his kneecaps shot-off as Brown places a timebomb on his crotch 
   (BOOM!). Finally, Brown invades Hawk's compound with his trusty 
   rocket and machine gun-equipped motorcycle and dispatches Hawk with a 
   maneuver best seen to be believed. Let's just say gravity has nothing 
   on Mr. Brown.&nbsp; This is grand entertainment for those who like 
   their action and bloodletting devoid of any logic at all. The carnage 
   comes fast and furious, some of it so unbelievable you'll be shaking 
   your head in amazement. In one scene, Brown is captured and being 
   tortured by having his back branded with a red-hot poker. He then 
   breaks free and shoves the same poker up the torturer's ass! There's 
   also a perilous car chase/shootout through the streets of Jakarta 
   that can best be described as delirious (especially the &quot;tree 
   through the windshield&quot; and the &quot;slippery tomatoes&quot; 
   gags). There are too many quotable lines of dialogue (supplied by 
   screenwriter Deddy Armand) to mention, but my favorite one comes 
   early in the film when a crook says to Brown: &quot;Who are you?&quot;
    Brown replies simply: &quot;Death.&quot; No one ever accused Chris 
   Mitchum of being a good actor (watch him trying to emote when he's 
   being tortured to see him at his &quot;best&quot;), but he excels in 
   roles like this where emotion is secondary to running around blowing 
   up shit. Single-monikered director Arizal (<B><A HREF="#SpecialSilencers">SPECIAL

   in this that you wonder if producer Gope T. Samtani was also in the 
   housing renewal business) and he also sprinkles a healthy dose of 
   black humor in some scenes. In one scene, where Brown is laying waste 
   to one of Hawk's warehouses, one thug says to another, &quot;You're 
   not afraid to die, are you soldier?&quot; The other one salutes, says 
   &quot;No sir!&quot; and then is promptly gunned down by Brown. 
   Priceless! The dialogue between the goons will make you laugh out 
   loud as they spout line like, &quot;Who are you calling an asshole, 
   you asshole?!&quot; and &quot;Fuck you AND your mother!&quot; So, 
   leave your brain at the door, sit down, press PLAY and enjoy the

   read the synopsis on the back of the VHS boxes before I watch a film 
   (most of them give away too much information), I thought this film 
   was going to be a straight war actioner (look at the front of the VHS 
   box and you'll get the same impression). For the first twenty minutes 
   it is, but then it takes a 180-degree turn and becomes a standard <B><A HREF="bloodfist_1989.htm">BLOODFIST</A></B>-style
    martial arts flick and not a very good one at that. Director/screenwriter

   [1987], among many others), can't seem to make up his mind what type 
   of film he wanted to make here. It sure didn't help casting non-actor 
   Dale &quot;Apollo&quot; Cook in the lead role, because he is one of 
   the worst real-life martial artists-turned-B-movie action heroes to 
   come out of the late-80's/early-90's. If his line readings were any 
   stiffer, he would be laying on a morgue table waiting for the 
   rib-spreader. Director Avellana, who seems to have a fetish for 
   explosions, does infuse the war portion of the film with a sense of 
   verve (something he picked up, no doubt, from Santiago) and the final 
   ten minutes are also action-packed, but the majority of this flick is 
   just a tired rehash of countless other martial arts tournament films. 
   Since Avellana also wrote the screenplay to the wacky-beyond-words <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Killing Satan">THE
    KILLING OF SATAN</A></B> (1983), I'll give him a pass on <B>FIST OF GLORY</B>.
    Besides, he does manage to include the appearance of a midget during 
   one of the fight sequences. Is there anything more adorable than 
   watching a tiny person running around in nothing but a pair of

   success of TV's <B><A HREF="charlies_angels_tv_series.htm">CHARLIE'S ANGELS</A></B> 
   (1976 - 1981) spawned many imitators, including this Indonesian 
   action flick. A scientist named Hardy invents a new type of explosive 
   (&quot;With this type of formula, people can blow up mountains 
   without any danger!&quot; What? How is that fucking possible?), but 
   he worries about it falling into the wrong hands (&quot;If crooks get 
   a hold of it, imagine the bloody big bang it would cause!&quot; What 
   a minute, I thought it was safe!). Immediately after making those 
   statements, Hardy and his girlfriend Yanti (Yati Octavia) are 
   kidnapped, blindfolded and taken to the home of the big boss, Mr. 
   Brutho, who tells Hardy that he either hands over the formula or he 
   will kill Yanti. Fortunately, Yanti (who is an expert marksman) 
   escapes and is saved on the side of a road by Anita (Debby Cynthia 
   Dewi; <B><A HREF="mystics_in_bali_1981.htm">MYSTICS IN BALI</A></B> - 
   1981), a chick in a black leather outfit (complete with black cowboy 
   hat) who beats the crap out of one of Mr. Brutho's goons in super 
   slow-motion, destroying his car in the process. Anita agrees to help 
   Yanti in her quest to rescue her boyfriend (It seems Anita is tired 
   of being mistreated by the &quot;greasers&quot; in town), but first 
   they have to save Yanti's mother and young sister from the clutches 
   of some kidnappers, leading to a comedic car chase that ends with the 
   kidnappers dying in a fiery crash (Not so funny now, is it?). Yanti 
   and Anita stop at a disco f<A HREF="five_deadly_angels_1980b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/five deadly angels vcd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="286" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>or
    some drinks (Killing bad guys makes you thirsty. It's a known fact. 
   Look it up.), where they watch Dana (Dana Christina; <B><A HREF="#Stabilizer">THE
    STABILIZER</A></B> - 1984) sing a disco tune in Indonesian and she 
   agrees to help in Yanti's plight (Dana is an expert knife thrower as 
   well as a singer). The trio turns into a quartet when crossbow expert 
   Lydia (Lydia Kandou) joins the team and then turns into a quintet 
   when kung-fu expert Lulu, The Lightning Lady (Eva Arnaz; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Warrior1981">THE
    WARRIOR</A></B> - 1981) takes up arms to join the fight. Lulu beats 
   the snot out of a male motorcycle gang in a restaurant (complete with 
   transvestite waitress!), where in one hilarious scene, a restaurant 
   patron swallows a raw egg and coughs-up a live baby chick! When two 
   of Brutho's goons kidnap Anita, the other four girls rescue her and 
   tie-up the two goons, leaving each one of them a &quot;gift&quot;: a 
   live crab shoved down their pants! When Mr. Brutho is finally 
   successful in kidnapping Yanti's mother and baby sister, Yanti and 
   the four superhero chicks perform a daring raid on Brutho's 
   compounds, resulting in death, destruction (including one hellacious 
   explosion) and a helicopter rescue, where each of the women use their 
   individual talents to good effect. Hooray for female power!&nbsp; 
   This is a hilariously bad action flick, complete with awful dubbing 
   (where everyone speaks with an Australian accent), badly-staged 
   action scenes (which are either cranked-up in the camera way too fast 
   or way too slow, giving some sequences, such as the car chases, a 
   Keystone Kops feel, and other sequences, such as the women running or 
   fighting in super slow-motion, a <B><A HREF="six_million_dollar_man_tv_series.htm">SIX
    MILLION DOLLAR MAN</A></B> look, complete with the patented Steve 
   Austin sound effects!) and comedy mixed with sudden tragedy. That's 
   what makes these Indonesian action films so wonderful to watch. No 
   matter how hard you try, you can't possibly anticipate what's to come 
   next. Director/screenwriter Danu Umbara (<B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#JungleVirginForce">JUNGLE
    VIRGIN FORCE</A></B> - 1982) consistantly surprises the viewer here, 
   such as when Lydia's obese female assistant Fatsy pisses in her pants 
   when Lydia shoots an apple off her head with a crossbow or the 
   head-scratching sequence where Dana breaks out into song to cheer-up 
   Yanti and we're then treated to a pre-MTV music video montage of Dana 
   singing on a beach while wearing a variety of bikinis. Particularly 
   funny is the dastardly Mr. Brutho, who precedes all his dialogue by 
   saying &quot;I'm a good man!&quot; and then doing simply awful 
   things, like shooting his own men for fucking-up, siccing his dogs on 
   his girlfriend for trying to help Hardy escape or hanging Yanti's 
   young sister over a pit of poisonous snakes to force Hardy to turn 
   over the formula. The film is also full of oddball characters (one of 
   Brutho's best goons has a scar on the side of his face that looks 
   like a giant leech), explosions and a smattering of gore, so why not 
   sit back, put your brain in neutral and just get lost in the 
   craziness that is known as <B><A HREF="five_deadly_angels_1980d.htm">FIVE

   there are no people there being kept against their will. The 
   detection of an undercover newspaper reporter who has infiltrated the

   (1985), may not represent Clouse at his prime, but there are glimpses 
   of brilliance here. Particularly interesting are when Jim and his 
   team break Willard out of prison, causing death and destruction, only 
   to discover that Willard is living the high life behind bars (his 
   cell is enormous and contains a huge projection TV, a sectional sofa 
   and a separate bedroom!) and is bedding the warden's beautiful 
   daughter. The only reason Willard agrees to go with them is because 
   they ruined the good thing he had going there (especially when the 
   warden finds out about his daughter!). There's also the mystery as to 
   what roams the basement corridors of the Reverend's Palace of 
   Celestial Tranquility (which is given away if you look at the patch 
   worn by the Reverend's followers); the Reverend's punishment of a 
   quartet of his men who fail to properly guard the huge stash of drugs 
   and guns he has in his warehouse (think very sharp spurs and exposed 
   necks); and lots of martial arts fights with plenty of over-amped 
   sound effects. It's apparent that Clouse based his screenplay on the 
   Jim Jones tragedy in Guyana (this is also an unofficial remake of 
   director Oscar Williams' <B><A HREF="hot_potato_1976.htm">HOT POTATO</A></B> 
   [1976], minus most of the humor), but Jim's team makes sure that the 
   outcome is not the same (no mass suicide here), just lots of fights, 
   a smidgen of gore (when Richard Norton kills a man by tossing a 
   rotary saw blade into his stomach, he says, &quot;Thank God for Black 
   and Decker!&quot;) and the Reverend's ability to turn himself 
   invisible (a talent I don't believe Jim Jones had). <B><A HREF="force_five_1981b.htm">FORCE:

   They make it to an enemy outpost, where we witness a bald-headed Thai

   - 1990), is so goofy and full of &quot;What The Fuck?&quot; moments, 
   it won me over almost immediately (In the beginning of the film, the 
   downed plane's pilot deploys his parachute and crashes through the 
   roof of a hut. The blind girl asks, &quot;What's that noise?&quot; A 
   little boy answers, &quot;Someone's dropped in!&quot;). There's also 
   a half-hearted attempt at social relevance about taking sides in a 
   political war where there can be no winners, but it's hard to take it 
   seriously when the film is full of scenes like the one where the 
   drunk General picks the tribal leader's daughter (&quot;Hey, I want 
   that young one there!&quot;) and removes his wooden leg before he 
   rapes her, only to have his leg stolen by the tribal leader's dog! 
   There's also the scene where the missile motorcycle (it's nothing but 
   a motor scooter mounted on a hang glider) takes flight in the air, 
   but not before magically sprouting two huge training wheels on the 
   back wheel (Where the hell did they come from?). Toss in two attacks 
   by the biggest red-eyed vampire bats I've ever seen, lots of bloody 
   violence (stabbings, bullet hits, knives tossed into the foreheads of 
   enemy soldiers, exploding bodies and a hatchet to the neck) and an 
   American villian called &quot;Dr. Pinkeye&quot;, and what you end up 
   with is a nonsensical, thoroughlly entertaining action flick with a 
   few surprises along the way. My favorite line comes towards the end

   What a total piece of crap! This is the type of film where everyone 
   exists in some type of screwed-up alternate universe, where a radio 
   disc jockey wears a space suit (complete with helmet) while doing a 
   solo show in his cramped booth and everyone owns their own portable 
   flight machine (be it airplane, glider, hot air balloon or 
   skycopter). When a motorcycle gang blows up the van of radio disc 
   jockey Jimmy Jet (Terry Michos), amateur pilot Will Powerski (Paul 
   Tanashian) drops out of the sky in one of his hand-built portable 
   airplanes and offers Jimmy a ride home. After explaining his last 
   name to Jimmy by simply stating, &quot;I'm Polish!&quot;, Will flies 
   Jimmy to his home and shows Jimmy his newest invention, the 
   &quot;skycopter&quot;, a combination helicopter/airplane. The main 
   plot deals with oil being found underneath the town of Libertyville 
   and a crooked real estate developer, by the name of Mr. L.B. Jason 
   (William '<B><A HREF="blacula_1972.htm">BLACULA</A></B>' Marshall, in 
   an embarassing low point in his career), who tries to keep the oil

   motorcycle gang that blew up Jimmy's van to terrorize the town and, 
   with the help of corrupt Sheriff Burgess (Aldo Ray, who else?), Mr. 
   Jason plans on scaring all the townspeople out of their homes, 
   thereby buying their properties at rock-bottom prices. Will and Jimmy 
   become fast friends and then business partners. They soon catch on to 
   Mr. Jason's plan and battle the motorcycle gang from the air. That's 
   about the whole plot in a nutshell. The rest of the unrelenting 96 
   minute running time is filled with endless scenes of skycopters in 
   flight (a late 70's fad that, thankfully, never caught on because 
   they are noisy as hell), a motorcycle gang that is about as scary as 
   a toothless old woman gumming corn on the cob and some of the worst 
   action scenes in late 70's cinema. The finale finds Will calling on 
   all his friends, who all own one type of flying machine or another, 
   to lead an aerial assault on the town of Libertyville, as they drop 
   explosives on the bikers while Wagner's &quot;Flight Of The 
   Valkryies&quot; plays on the soundtrack. The town then celebrates at 
   a disco. You've been hustled!&nbsp; When you find out that this film 
   was directed/produced and co-written by Lawrence D. Foldes, who also 
   made the notoriously-bad films <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Nightstalker">NIGHTSTALKER</A></B>

   (1986), you basically know what to expect here: Bad acting, 
   awkwardly-staged action sequences and some washed-up stars earning 
   some extra booze money (Aldo Ray stayed smashed thanks to roles in 
   films like this). Most of the film plays like some G-rated kiddie 
   fare but, every once in a while, Foldes throws in a swear word or 
   some nudity (including some bare-assed shots of male stars Michos and 
   Tanashian) to try to fool you into believing that you're watching 
   something adult. William Marshall seems to have filmed all his scenes 
   on one set in a single day. He looks extremely embarassed spouting 
   such cringe-worthy dialogue like, &quot;That lard-ass sheriff can be 
   bought with a keg of beer!&quot; or &quot;Oh God, how I love to take 
   advantage of the underdogs!&quot; in his distinctive baritone voice. 
   It's like watching Sir Laurence Olivier perform in a Three Stooges 
   short. The motorcycle gang seen here is about as frightening as a 
   bunch of 3 year-olds on tricycles. Their idea of scaring the town 
   into submission consists of setting cars on fire, disrupting some 
   drive-in restaurant customers' meals and one gang member steals a 
   girl's ice cream cone! <B><A HREF="gilligans_island_tv_series_1964-1967.htm">GILLIGAN'S
    ISLAND</A></B>'s Professor, Russell Johnson, puts in a quick cameo 
   as Will's friend, Professor Benson (typecasting 101), who supplies 
   Will with all the explosives he'll need to take back the town from 
   those nasty bikers. This awful action film was filmed in 1980, but 
   wasn't released until 1982. Doesn't that tell you all you need to 
   know? Believe it or not, this film was &quot;Produced in association 
   with the Academy of Science Fiction and Horror Films Internship 
   Program&quot;. That could explain why that academy's president, Dr. 
   Donald A. Reed, was Casting Director here. Also starring Alex Mann,

   The first CIA agent is blown-up in mid-air while parasailing. The 
   second agent is shot point-blank in a train car by a shady character 
   with a silencer-equipped pistol. The dunderheads back in Washington 
   D.C. are extremely worried, because those dead agents were sent to 
   Thailand to retrieve a stolen experimental missile, codenamed 
   &quot;Project Alpha&quot;, with a 20 megaton warhead. The D.C. 
   dickheads believe one of four people or groups can be responsible for 
   the theft of the missile and the deaths of the agents: Power-mad 
   General Yang; brutal businessman Jake Koo; a group of ninja-clad 
   nutjobs called the Fuji Terrorists; or that old Cold War standby, the 
   KGB. Washington decides to send another CIA agent to Thailand to 
   uncover the truth, the hugely successful and unorthodox Eddie Fulmer 
   (a badly-dubbed Christopher Mitchum; <B><A HREF="#Final Score">FINAL SCORE</A></B> 
   - 1986), who fakes-out Koo's waiting henchmen by dressing as a priest 
   as he steps off the plane (the henchmen end up following the wrong 
   guy!). Eddie is informed by his CIA contact that he must cozy-up to 
   Erica (Olivia Hussey, Mitchum's co-star in <B><A HREF="#SummertimeKiller">THE
    SUMMERTIME KILLER</A></B> [1972]), who happens to be Eddie's 
   ex-girlfriend AND the daughter of Jake Koo (boy, that's some 
   coincidence). Koo is working in cahoots with General Yang to gain 
   possession of Project Alpha (who really has possession of it is not 
   made clear). Eddie joins forces with Thai Secret Service Agent 
   Winlock and Officer Lila when they save Eddie from an attack by the 
   Fuji Terrorists. Luckily, today is Erica's birthday, so Eddie attends 
   her huge party and meets daddy Koo and his head henchman Zeke (Krung 
   Sivilat), who is instantly wary of Eddie after this hilarious 
   exchange: <B>Zeke</B> (after shaking hands with Eddie): &quot;You've 
   got a smooth touch.&quot; <B>Eddie</B>: &quot;Yeah, well I cream 
   twice a day with Bonds.&quot; (I nearly shit my pants!). Koo orders 
   Zeke to keep an eye on Eddie, who ends up falling back in love with 
   Erica, but her father has promised her hand in marriage to Zeke. 
   Someone tries to kill Eddie at the party, which leads to a car chase 
   that ends with the bad guy decapitating himself when he rams his car 
   into the blades of a crane at a junkyard. Things get complicated when 
   the KGB tries to kidnap Erica, but Zeke saves her (another car chase 
   with a couple of good stunts); the Fuji Terrorists make another 
   attempt on Eddie's life (Won't they ever learn?); and Eddie and Zeke 
   duke it out for Erica's hand (Eddie loses and ends up chained to a 
   dungeon wall, pumped full of truth serum). More complications arise 
   when Eddie is brough<A HREF="h-bomb_1976b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/h-bomb vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="126" HEIGHT="231" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>t
    on a raid of the Fuji Terrorists' camp by Koo and Zeke to test his 
   loyalty, only to have the raid be a trap set up by Koo's girlfriend, 
   who is actually a Fuji Terrorist (even the bad guys can't trust each 
   other!). The trio manage to escape by stealing a helicopter, which 
   leads to a finale involving a runaway train and a ship containing the 
   now-activated Project Alpha, ready to release its 20 megaton glory. 
   Who will survive?&nbsp; First of all, you must abandon all logic and 
   believable dialogue (the Australian dubbers hilariously mispronounce 
   &quot;Asia&quot; as &quot;Aser&quot;, &quot;Alpha&quot; as 
   &quot;Alpher&quot; and tend to add a hard &quot;r&quot; sound to any 
   word ending in a vowel) if you wish to experience the full joy that 
   is <B><A HREF="h-bomb_1976.htm">H-BOMB</A></B> (made in 1973, but not 
   released to English-speaking countries until 1976). Director P. 
   Chalong (real name: Chalong Pakdivijit) and screenwriter Pracha 
   Poonitwat (!) toss-in numerous gunfights, car chases, explosions and 
   good old hand-to-hand combat to go along with the ridiculous romantic 
   rivalry subplot. Throughout the film, Chalong manages to create some 
   oddball sights, such as topless bodypainted go-go dancers; Koo's 
   control room, where he not only keeps tabs on every room in his 
   palatial mansion, he also plays chess against a super computer (and 
   wins!); a helicopter explosion; a plane explosion; a head-on 
   collision between two trains (no models here, this is the real deal); 
   and other sequences best seen by the viewers, including a James 
   Bond-inspired opening and closing tune, where an unidentified male 
   singer, trying to sound like Tom Jones, informs us over and over, 
   &quot;Oh, the end is near!&quot;. There are enough double and triple 
   crosses here to fill a puzzle book, so be prepared to keep your eyes 
   and ears on the screen. <B><A HREF="h-bomb_1976b.htm">H-BOMB</A></B>

   can only shoot straight when he's drunk; expert climber Tarzan (Ben 
   Aladin); movie stuntman Bruce (Philip Castel); and expert 
   knife-thrower Slater (Robert Buharis); split-up into groups of two 
   and search different locations near the border for the drug factory 
   (but not before we get little peeks into their individual talents, 
   which culminates in a big fight on a lumberyard movie set). Johnny 
   and the Sergeant go digging in the woods looking for clues of 
   marijuana planting and Johnny asks a young girl named Michelle (Jenny 
   Ferris), who lives in a hut nearby, if he can borrow a pickaxe (he 
   lies to Michelle, telling her he's a geologist working for the UN).

    can get some intel on who is running the drug factory and end up 
   getting into a bar fight (What would a Filipino actioner be without a 
   bar fight?), when the Big Boss' girl Emma won't quit dancing with 
   Tarzan (who wears a loincloth instead of pants!). Ronald and Bruce 
   take jobs at the local quarry, where Ronald meets the foreman's 
   sister Vicky and two local workers take an instant dislike to the new 
   pair. Later that night, Johnny and the Sergeant have dinner with 
   Michelle and her widowed mother and a romance develops between Johnny 
   and Michelle. Her Mom gives the Sergeant a suspicious look when he 
   asks if she has noticed anyone planting a large amount of crops in 
   the area. The next morning, Ronald and Bruce end up fighting the 
   entire quarry when a $200 bet on a boxing match goes terribly wrong. 
   All of this activity naturally raises the suspicions of the big drug 
   boss, known as the Commander (a common name given to both bad and 
   good guys in Filipino cinema), so he orders his henchmen, Weasel and 
   Eddie, to kidnap Michelle. The Sergeant and his team formulate a plan 
   to bring the drug operation down and save Michelle, so they follow 
   quarry foreman Bobby as he makes a drug drop. After a small fight 
   where some of Bobby's contacts are killed or captured, Bobby spills 
   his guts to the team as long as they protect his sister, Vicky. It 
   seems the Commander's drug factory is located on a heavily guarded 
   parcel of land called Hill 171. The team devises a plan to sneak up 
   Hill 171, unaware that the Commander and his men are waiting for them 
   (The Commander says, &quot;This is going to be just like a turkey 
   shoot!&quot; as his men laugh hysterically). The bloody finale finds 
   everyone dead, except for two. Can you guess who they are? I bet you 
   can.&nbsp; Though way too comical for its own good (There are many 
   jokes made about Tarzan's smelly penis, which one member of the team 
   calls his &quot;stinky monkey&quot;) and an uncredited screenplay 
   that goes off on way too many tangents (mainly used as excuses to 
   introduce some badly choreographed martial arts fights), director 
   Romeo Montoya (as far as I can tell, his only directorial credit) 
   redeems himself in the final third of the film when members of the 
   team get to use their unique talents to assault the drug factory on 
   Hill 171. Up until this point, a gun is only fired on two occasions 
   (once to kill a drug smuggler in the film's opening shot and another 
   to shoot one of Bobby's contacts) and there are no explosions at all, 
   but once the team make it up the hill and enter the drug factory, the 
   bullets start to fly and things begin blowing-up in fiery glory. 
   Still, <B>HILL 171</B> lacks the non-stop insanity we've come to 
   expect from 80's Filipino action cinema and points are deducted when 
   the final assault is filmed in the dead of night and is woefully 
   underlit, making it impossible to make out who is getting shot or 
   dying. Thankfully, the battle rages until the sun rises, so we do get 
   to see some of the good guys use their talents and the bad guys 
   receiving their just desserts, before most of the good guys also end 
   up dead (usually by being shot in the back). In the end, though, <B>HILL
    171</B> merely registers as a minor example of what the Philippines 
   was capable of turning out in the action genre. It's not necessarily 
   a smelly monkey, but it's no breath of fresh air, either. This Sunny 
   Film Production (produced by Ann Hung and Sunny Lim), presented by 
   Davian International Ltd., never had a legitimate U.S. home video

   Hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake and everyone has their

   action films can make that statement?), this film could have failed 
   miserably but, thanks to the four leads, it hits nearly every one of

   The ineptitude that follows is truly staggering. The film opens with 
   Mob boss Mr. Feliciano (the stoic Jim Mitchum) ordering his goons to 
   kidnap a little boy from mother Rebecca (Julie Schoen), whose husband 
   stole six million dollars from Mr. Feliciano three years earlier (why

   Hollywood cop Turquoise (David Goss; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#She1983">SHE</A></B> 
   - 1983), or &quot;Turquey&quot; for short. We first spot Turquey 
   breaking up a rape in a motel room, where everyone involved is shot 
   multiple times and the rapist has his hand, then head, cut off by the 
   raped woman's husband (you have to see it to believe it). After being 
   chewed-out by boss Cameron Mitchell, Turquey and partner Jaguar (late 
   exploitation vet Lincoln Kilpatrick; <B><A HREF="omega_man_1971.htm">THE
    OMEGA MAN</A></B> - 1971) help Rebecca find her son. This leads to 
   an all-woman oil wrestling match, where Jaguar wrestles two women for 
   $20 and afterwards they get an address for Rebecca's husband. They 
   find him but he needs three days to get the money together.&nbsp; He 
   finally gets the money (I guess nothing happened for three days) and 
   they devise a plan to rescue the boy (it's not much of a plan, 
   really). Meanwhile, the little boy, who is always being threatened 
   with physical harm by a goon named Animal (&quot;Eat your sandwich, 
   you little chicken-shit!&quot;), befriends a dog he talks to through 
   his barred window. The dog helps the kid escape (!), which leads to a 
   chase where the dog is killed and the kid being smacked around by 
   Animal.&nbsp; When Rebecca's husband tries to pay the ransom with 
   counterfeit money (he's not the sharpest tool in the shed), he is 
   killed and the kid is not rescued. Turquey is booted off the force 
   after the failed rescue attempt and then goes on a one man vendetta 
   to bring those responsible to justice or to just meet their 
   maker.&nbsp; I can't begin to explain the wonderful awfulness of the 
   Iranian-funded film. Director Amir Shervan, who would later make <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#KillingAmerStyle88">KILLING
    AMERICAN STYLE</A></B> (1988) and the even more loopy <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#SamuraiCop">SAMURAI
    COP</A></B> (1989), hasn't the foggiest idea how to make a remotely 
   coherent film. The camera setups are all over the place (no two edits 
   in the same scene ever match), the action laughable (There's one 
   scene where Jim Mitchum is running with the kid in his arms and he 
   trips and falls right on the kid! I doubt that it was scripted.), the 
   acting piss-poor (It's apparent the director used a lot of non-actor 
   friends in the roles of Feliciano's goons, probably because they 
   contributed to the budget.) and the dialogue risable (&quot;You're no 
   Clint Westwood.&quot; and &quot;My stomach is a TUMS festival!&quot; 
   are two lines Cameron Mitchell has to deliver with a straight face.). 
   The film is also a racist's dream come true, as there are jokes about 
   Orientals not being able to say the word &quot;Chevrolet&quot; 
   correctly, jokes about Blacks being on welfare (not to mention Jaguar 
   being portrayed as someone more interested in chasing women than 
   dispensing justice) and the film is strewn with Italians with names 
   like &quot;Spaghetti&quot;. Toss in copious amounts of nudity, bad 
   dubbing, over-the-top violence, gore and Aldo Ray as an Oriental 
   Triad boss named Mr. Fong (!) and what you get is the <B><A HREF="plan_nine_from_outer_space_1959.htm">PLAN

    COP</A></B> look like they were shot in one take (some people can be 
   seen waiting for the director to yell &quot;Action!&quot; before they 
   move) and it's plain to see that Jim Mitchum (<B><A HREF="#Code Name Zebra">CODE
    NAME: ZEBRA</A></B> - 1986) looks like he wants out as soon as 
   possible. Still, it's entertaining, even if it is for all the wrong

   the eye of Johnny Rockford (Wang Tao), who summons her to his home 
   the next day (He's sitting in a hot tub and says to Allison in<A HREF="inferno_thunderbolt_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/inferno thunderbolt greek vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="318" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   dubbed halted English, &quot;The burden...of earning a living...rest 
   heavily...on pretty girls. I want to help you!&quot;). Allison turns 
   down his offer (and sexual advances), which doesn't sit too well with 
   Johnny. He orders a hit on reporter Claire (Claire Angela), who is 
   doing an in-depth article on the Rockford Family's illegal dealings. 
   This is where the newly-shot footage comes into play. Claire is the 
   wife of cop Richard (Harrison) and at first Johnny intimidates Claire 
   by leaving the decapitated head of her pet dog in her kitchen drawer. 
   Instead of giving up, Claire continues writing her story, much to 
   Richard's despair (She manages to keep his mind off the situation by 
   having a long, sweaty and nude lovemaking session with him!). Claire 
   is eventually killed by a paid assassin (Pierre Tremblay) hired by 
   Johnny (She is bloodily beaten across her back with a chain) and dies 
   in Richard's arms. Richard turns vigilante and uses photos in 
   Claire's camera to identify the assassin and begins hunting him down. 
   Meanwhile, with the help of ex-boyfriend Michael, Allison pretends to 
   be Johnny's girlfriend and he brings her home to meet Mama Rockford 
   (Mona Liu), the wheelchair-bound matriarch of the Rockford Family. 
   Mama takes an instant dislike to Allison (She says to Johnny, 
   &quot;Play around with loose women if you want, but as for bringing 
   them home, forget it!&quot;) and kicks Allison out of the house (By 
   saying, &quot;We're not a free charity...for freeloaders!&quot;). Of 
   course, Johnny doesn't listen to Mama's advice and begins courting 
   Allison (Johnny even goes so far as to commit his current girlfriend 
   Lily [Rose Kuei] to a mental institution, where she is forced to get 
   daily doses of electroshock treatment!). Allison begins to slowly 
   dismantle the Rockford Family, first by having Michael pretend to be 
   a rooftop sniper; purposely shooting Johnny in the shoulder and 
   making it look like Allison saved him. Johnny then brings Allison 
   home again, only this time he disobeys Mama's orders when she demands 
   Allison leaves the house (Johnny says, &quot;She saved my life and 
   could one day be the mother of your grandchildren!&quot;). As Allison 
   begins pitting son against mother, Richard (who, for some unknown 
   reason, now has an Asian sidekick) buys a big-assed handgun from the 
   black market and begins shaking down and beating the crap out of 
   street scum while looking for his wife's assassin. I have the feeling 
   things aren't going to turn out well for the Rockford Family and 
   their associates.&nbsp; Even though this has all the earmarks of Ho's 
   cut-and-paste actioners (badly-matched editing of old and new scenes; 
   a music soundtrack full of stolen cues; terrible English dubbing; 
   etc.), the fact is that it is still an entertaining mishmash of good 
   ideas. The older footage is especially interesting, as there is a 
   strange Oedipal relationship between Mama and Johnny (&quot;Don't 
   call me Mother! It's Mama!&quot; she screams at Johnny at one point 
   in the film) and things get really interesting once we discover that 
   Mama's wheelchair is tricked-out with matching spearguns! Allison's 
   taking advantage of that incestuous relationship is also pretty 
   ingenious until she takes it a step too far and it backfires on her 
   (you can't really separate a son from his mother no matter how hard 
   you try), as she, too, is sent to the mental institution for some 
   unwelcome electroshock treatments. In the long run, the Richard 
   Harrison footage is superfluous and destroys the flow of the film 
   proper. You should also be made aware that there is precious little 
   martial arts action or gunplay on view (until the finale), as <B><A HREF="inferno_thunderbolt_1985b.htm">INFERNO
    THUNDERBOLT</A></B> is more interested in the mechanics of revenge 
   than the actual act of revenge itself. That is not to say that 
   there's not plenty of death and destruction (Including a hilarious 
   shot of Claire dropping a melon in slow-motion when she discovers the 
   head of her precious dog. It smashes into a million juicy pieces on 
   the floor in a lame attempt by Ho to symbolize Claire's distress of 
   losing her pet. It's supposed to be sad, but it comes off as quite 
   the opposite.), it's just that most of it comes in the final minutes. 
   I especially loved the scene of Mama shooting a couple of spears into 
   the ass of her other, porn magazine-addicted, son just before she is 
   arrested (Now there's symbolism at it's best!). It's distressing that 
   these Ho/Lai pastiche films get panned as a whole, when there are 
   actually some very good ones in the bunch. <B>INFERNO THUNDERBOLT</B> 
   is one of the good ones. It's not perfect, but it sure is a blast to 
   watch. Also starring Jackie Lim, Donald Kong, Lewis Chan, Kirk Chow 
   and Raymond Wong. Never released on home video in the U.S.; the print 
   I viewed was sourced from a Greek-subtitled VHS tape on the Olympic

   others) the same people responsible for the must-see action flick <B><A HREF="#Stabilizer">THE
    STABILIZER</A></B> (1984), is another beyond-belief experience. In 
   the opening minutes, we are introduced to Rambu (O'Brian), an 
   out-of-work ex-cop who saves a woman from two thugs who have hit her 
   with their car (One thug says to the woman, &quot;Hey lady, look 
   where you're walking!&quot; She replies, &quot;I was!&quot;). Rambu 
   breaks the car's windows with a pipe, beats up the thugs and, to 
   teach them a lesson, repeatedly hits them in the head with his 
   gravity-defying multi-colored rubber ball, which returns to his hand 
   after every throw. Unfortunately, the thugs work for drug kingpin 
   John White (Craig Gavin), who orders his men to kill Rambu. They trap 
   him in a phone booth, put a black cloth sack over his head and beat 
   him with pipes, but he breaks free and beats the bejesus out of them. 
   Mr. White gets mad (He says, &quot;Rambu, Rambu, Rambu! I'm sick and 
   tired of hearing that name!&quot;) <A HREF="intruder_1986b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/intruder 1986 poster small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>and
    orders his right-hand man Bram (Kandar Sinyo) to do whatever it 
   takes to get rid of Rambu. Three of White's men rape and kill Rambu's 
   friend Jenny (Jenny Farida) after stripping her naked in a lake (One 
   thug says, &quot;I'm your lover now!&quot;). When Rambu finds out, he 
   goes to a pool hall where he's about to kill the thugs responsible 
   for Jenny's death, when the police arrest him. He agrees to work for 
   government men Mr. Andre (Kaharuddin Syah) and Steve (Harry Capri) to 
   bring Mr. White to justice. White has his men kidnap Rambu's 
   girlfriend Ella (Lia Warokka) and tie her up spread-eagle in the 
   middle of a field as bait (This is after Mr. White tries to rape her, 
   but is interrupted by his girlfriend). Rambu, his friend Bobby 
   (Adrian Nugraha) and a dozen men come to her rescue riding in three-wheeled
    electric carts in a scene that must be seen to be believed. Rambu 
   gets Mr. White's safe combination after he beats up Bram then, 
   dressed as a black ninja, goes to White's office and steals 
   incriminating documents out of the safe and hands them over to Mr. 
   Andre. We then find out that Mr. Andre is as crooked as Mr. White, as 
   he uses the documents to bribe Mr. White out of a million dollars. 
   When Rambu finds out, the shit (not to mention lots of food) hits the 
   fan. Rambu goes Rambo in the explosive finale.&nbsp; This crazy 
   action flick, directed by Jopi Burnama (<B><A HREF="ferocious_female_freedom_fighters_1982.htm">FEROCIOUS
    FEMALE FREEDOM FIGHTERS</A></B> - 1982; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#WarVictims">WAR
    VICTIMS</A></B> - 1985), is full of so many wild action sequences (I 
   still laugh out loud every time I picture Rambu and his rubber ball 
   of doom) and quotable dialogue, your head will swim. My favorite 
   sequence comes at a banquet, when Rambu finds out that Mr. Andre is 
   on the take. He enters the banquet with an aluminum bat and 
   proclaims, &quot;Fuck you! You dirty, lying, swindling bastards. 
   You're two of a kind. Fuck you!&quot; and then proceeds to smash all 
   the food on the tables! In slow motion! Other choice bits of dialogue 
   are: &quot;Just hold it right there, Rambu. We've got you covered 
   like a blanket!&quot; and &quot;Give him the blood red carpet 
   treatment!&quot; Priceless stuff. I also love how Mr. White manages 
   to kill more of his own people than the opposition. He kills his best 
   female drug mule (for ratting to the police), his right-hand man Bram 
   (for giving up the safe combination) and girlfriend Clara (for 
   turning on him). He's one tough man to work for! The final sequence, 
   where Rambu ties a red bandana around his forehead and seeks revenge 
   cements this film from ever getting a legal release on home video in 
   the United States. Forget for the moment that his name is 
   &quot;Rambu&quot;, Peter O'Brian bears such a striking resemblance to

   woman, who is taken to a secret island to be drugged and and

   Madam Kim Soo (Vilaiwan Vatanapanich).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The film opens with tourists Phyllis (Hansi Linder; <B><A HREF="harry novak.htm#Mad Butcher">THE
    MAD BUTCHER</A></B> - 1972) and her mother Maud Leighton (Loni 
   Heuser) taking in a kickboxing match and then taking a boat tour 
   through the canals of Bangkok (The tour guide calls Bangkok the 
   &quot;Venice of the Orient&quot;, but it looks like a dirty, stinking 
   hole!). When they stop to do some shopping, Phyllis is kidnapped by 
   two screwy goons, Fingers (Herbert Fuchs; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#MarkOfTheDevil1970">MARK

   It looks like it didn't work!). Maud asks friend Captain Rowland, who 
   is in Bangkok for a police conference, to find her daughter, so he 
   calls up Jo Walker in New York and tells him to come to Thailand. 
   Almost immediately, a woman, under orders from criminal mastermind

   his clothes. In a scene of very funny comedy, Tom borrows some 
   clothes from a bellboy (The clothes are so small on the Captain, the 
   pants look like shorts!) and tries rushing to the airport to pick up 
   Jo, but everything he tries doesn't work out for him. As he leaves 
   the hotel, a dwarf hotel employee chases him, thinking he is a 
   bellboy shirking his duties (!) so he hops into a taxi that drives 
   way too slow. He jumps out of the taxi and buys a motorized bicycle 
   taxi (!), but it runs out of gas. Meanwhile, Jo arrives at the 
   airport and gets a ride from a stewardess he met on the plane (Women 
   find him irresistable, a running joke in all the films in this 
   series). He then hops into a taxi, but a truck blocks its way. Jo 
   sees something poke out of a hole in the truck bed and jumps out, 
   just before a flamethrower turns the taxi into a flaming wreck (This 
   scene is very surprising because a real flamethrower was used to 
   destroy the taxi). It leads into a gunfight between him and Fingers 
   &amp; Curly, which then leads to a fistfight (there are many in this 
   film, all well done). Just when it look like curtains for Jo, Tom 
   arrives and hits Curly with the three-wheeled taxi (he got some gas), 
   sending him flying into a nearby lake.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The criminal organzation tries several times to kill Jo and Tom, but 
   each time they save each other's skin (Jo is injected with a 
   paralyzing agent while Landru puts a cobra on his bed and just as the 
   snake is about to bite him, Tom arrives and shoots the cobra in the 
   head). Jo notices that all the people who try to kill them have a 
   tattoo of &quot;Three Golden Serpents&quot; (an alternate title for 
   this film) on their wrists. Meanwhile, on the island, Phyllis is 
   befriended by Petra (Rotraut de N&egrave;ve), who escapes the island 
   by riding a mudsled (you have to see it in action!) out to the ocean 
   while the tide is low. After several close calls on his life 
   (Including the flamethrower truck trying to run him over and crashing 
   into the ocean. You can see that this was a dangerous stunt for the 
   stuntman, one who barely escapes with his life! This leads to another 
   gunfight/fistfight in a warehouse.), Jo discovers that the only way 
   on the island is to be drugged and put on a boat, only waking up when 
   they are on the island (The organization does this to all clients, so 
   they don't know where the island is located.). Tom fakes being 
   drugged by a creepy Chinese man and when he is put on the boat, Madam 
   Kim Soo knows he isn't drunk (&quot;You're detestable. All white men 
   are!&quot;), so when he reaches the island, Fingers and Curly tie him 
   to a post with the captured Petra (She is killed with a poisoned 
   blowdart). Luckily, Jo has a transmitter in a lotus flower he has on 
   his lapel, so Tom can track him. Fingers throws the lotus to the 
   ground and steps on it. Will Tom be able to track and save Jo? (A 
   police captain says to Tom: &quot;Take it easy. I'll make you a 
   scotch and soda.&quot;) Will the criminal organization be defeated? 
   The answer is yes to both questions, as Tom parachutes on to the 
   island and&nbsp; the film ends in one gigantic mud fight! (Tom to Jo: 
   &quot;After this, your name is mud!&quot;)</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This film is fun on so many levels, I was sad when it ended. The 
   comedy works, which is rare for a film like this. Most of the comedy 
   has to do with the normally stiff Brad Harris, but he and Tony 
   Kendall had worked together on so many occasions, you can see the 
   chemistry between them. There's also a hilarious scene where it is 
   obvious the English dubbers were having fun. It has to do with a song 
   a black singer is crooning in a nightclub. Very seldom do her lips 
   match the lyrics to the song and it is very funny when you listen to 
   the actual lyrics to the song (I'll leave it for you to discover). 
   Director Roberto Mauri (<B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Kong Island">KONG
    ISLAND</A></B> - 1968) uses the locations to good effect and shows a 
   sure hand in the action scenes. There's a boat chase/explosion, a 
   crocodile attack (Madam Kim Soo owns a crocodile farm), a few car 
   chases and plenty of fights. If you like your action films fast and 
   loose, I recommend this one highly. Now I have to get my hands on the 
   other six entries in this franchise! I saw this streaming for free on 
   Amazon Prime. The print is widescreen and full of emulsion scratches, 
   but it only adds to the charm. You would think with the subject 
   matter that there would be plenty of nudity, but there is very 
   little, yet the females are seen with very little clothing, showing 
   us their busty charms. Also starring Carlos de Castro, Monica Pardo, 
   Marsh Thomson and Chana Sriubol. <B>Rated R</B>, but there is nothing 
   here that bears out that rating, just good-natured fun.</FONT></FONT></P>

   Indonesia: Where everyone knows how to fight, women are cheap and bad 
   guys are bald. At least in their movies, that is. This Indonesian 
   rape/revenge action flick (from Rapi Films, Indonesia's main purveyor 
   of sleazy entertainment) opens with a bald, sweaty guy trying to rape 
   a woman in his bed. When she fights back, he gives up and has his men 
   toss her out of the house (his men blindfold and tie her hands behind 
   her back with strips of cloth torn from her dress and then roll her 
   down a hill!). The bald guy (everyone calls him &quot;Boss&quot;, a 
   fairly common name in Indonesian genre films) then smokes a joint 
   while scantily-clad women practice martial arts around him. We then 
   cut to him drinking in a disco, where we learn that his real name is 
   Cobra (Rengga Takengon). He hits on cashier Irma (Eva Arnaz), but she 
   turns him down, which doesn't make Cobra happy at all. The film then 
   switches to Rudy (Clift Sangra), who is the husband of Irma, who is 
   pregnant. Rudy has major anger issues, especially when he gets 
   sexually excited. Whenever he gets aroused, he turns violent, which 
   is not good news for Irma and the baby in her belly, especially since 
   her doctor warns Irma that she's going to have a rough pregnancy and 
   any violent jerks or pulls could endanger her baby. Meanwhile, Cobra 
   has his men return to the disco and kidnap Irma (What???). They shoot 
   her up with heroin and place her on Cobra's bed (One of Cobra's men 
   says to him, &quot;Enjoy yourself!&quot;). When Irma fights back, 
   Cobra gives her to his men and they gang-rape her (When one guy is 
   done, another one says to him, &quot;That was quick!&quot;). She 
   escapes before they can kill her and she is<A HREF="i_want_to_get_even_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/i want to get even vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="264" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   picked-up by a friendly pedicab driver and taken home. We then switch 
   to Rudy, who dumps Irma out of his speeding car when he finds out 
   that her baby is the product of the gang-rape by Cobra's men (He says 
   to Irma, just before she flys out the door, &quot;You and your baby 
   are going straight to Hell!&quot;). After slapping around a 
   prostitute, Rudy questions the pedicab driver that drove Irma home 
   and he then goes to beat-up Cobra's men (in an awful display of 
   martial arts), but he is badly punched-around instead. Luckily, the 
   police show up and save his ass, but the bad guys get away. Rudy then 
   throws Irma out of their home when she refuses to get an abortion 
   (&quot;Leave now! I never want to see your face again!&quot;). Things 
   take a turn into the Twilight Zone when Rudy rapes Mia (Nenna 
   Rosier), the sister of Cobra's top henchman Ronnie (Hendro 
   Tangkilisan), in retribution for Irma's rape. Ronnie and his men then 
   ride their motorcycles through Rudy's home, tie him up, drag him 
   behind a motorcycle until they get to Ronnie's hideout and then beat 
   him to a bloody pulp (&quot;I'll teach you for messin' with my 
   sister!&quot;). Irma gets the abortion (We get to see the bloody, 
   aborted fetus!) and Rudy takes her back. Rudy then goes to Ronnie's 
   hideout and kills a couple of Ronnie's men with gunfire. He then 
   heads to Cobra's house, where Ronnie, Mia, Cobra, Rudy and the police 
   duke it out. Irma then shows up dressed like Rambo (!) and kills 
   Cobra with a nifty rocket launcher. What the hell?!?&nbsp; It's 
   really hard to keep on track with this film because it's told in a 
   confusing, non-linear manner. The dubbing, as always, is atrociously 
   hilarious (You never know what's going to come out of people's 
   mouths, such as when Cobra rapes Mia. He says to her, &quot;Your 
   brother said you'd love it!&quot; while his female goon, who is 
   listening downstairs, performs fellatio on her own thumb!). Let's 
   talk about Cobra for a moment. Besides looking like Sid Haig's 
   retarded brother, it seems that he spends 90% of his screen time 
   raping women while dressed in nothing but white briefs. He's a rather 
   ineffectual rapist, too, as the only woman he really rapes is Mia. 
   When the other women fight back, he loses interest quickly and tosses 
   them to his men. For a film that deals with so much rape, there's 
   very little nudity. The women usually keep their bras and panties on 
   or are filmed at angles where objects in the forefront cover their 
   naughty bits. There is some nudity, but it is only a couple of quick 
   frames and you'll have to hit the Pause button if you want to get a 
   good look. Director Maman Firmansjah (<B><A HREF="escape_from_hell_hole_1983.htm">ESCAPE
    FROM HELL HOLE</A></B> - 1983) hasn't got the slightest clue how to 
   establish continuity or film an action scene. The timeline is 
   non-existant (I was scratching my head on several occasions, 
   especially with Irma's scenes) and the finale contains the slowest 
   car chase and badly-choreographed fight scenes I've ever seen in an 
   Indonesian actioner (and that's saying a lot). It does contain a 
   nifty body explosion, though, followed by a quote from the Bible! 
   It's still hard to fault a film when the most sympathetic character 
   is Ronnie, a drug dealer and arms smuggler, since he's the only male 
   member of the cast who doesn't rape anyone! He also gives an 
   impassioned speech in the finale, begging his men to give up to the 
   police and accept their punishment. They refuse and Ronnie is shot 
   dead a few seconds later. Ah, Indonesia, how I love thee! Also known

    HEAT</A><A NAME="JungleHeat1984"></A> (1984) -</B> During the final 
   months of the Vietnam War, the U.S. hires a bunch of Vietnam locals 
   to drive supply trucks behind enemy lines. Gordon (a horrendously 
   dubbed Sam J. Jones of <B><A HREF="flash_gordon_1980.htm">FLASH GORDON</A></B> 
   [1980]) is given three weeks to train them for combat and weapons use 
   and, since they are volunteers and not enlisted men, he wants to tell 
   them how dangerous their assignment is, but his Captain (Christopher 
   Doyle) refuses to let him (The Captain has no problems with the 
   locals losing their lives on this mission and goes off on a rant on 
   how he's tired of this war and would rather be at home with his wife. 
   Duh!). After a long and boring segment where we watch Gordon and 
   Nguyen (Bobby Ming) train the volunteer squad and pit them against 
   each other on a mock driving obstacle course, the film kicks into 
   gear. The squad goes on their first real assignment, driving a convoy 
   of trucks on a dangerous road behind enemy lines. It goes off 
   relatively smooth (except for some spikes in the road), so they all 
   go to a strip club to celebrate and get into a bar fight with some 
   drunk American soldiers (a common theme in films of this type). The 
   film begins to get weird when we see some Vietcong gooks soak local 
   men with gasoline while they are tied to the ground. They then set a 
   (real) rat on fire and set it loose. The gooks then place bets on 
   which of the gasoline-soaked locals the rat will run across, setting 
   them on fire and slowly burning them in an agonizing death (The one 
   local who comes out unscathed is also set on fire once the contest is 
   over!). The volunteer squad's second assignment doesn't go well at 
   all. One of the trucks loses it's brakes, goes over an embankment and 
   explodes. The entire squad is then taken prisoner by the Vietcong 
   (the <A HREF="jungle_heat_1984d.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/jungle heat 1985 british dvd front small2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="187" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>same
    gooks involved in the flaming rat episode) and brought to a jungle 
   camp, where they are tortured. One guy is buried up to his neck out 
   in the hot sun, has the hair on his head shaved off and the top of 
   his head slit in two with a razor, exposing his brain. It doesn't end 
   there. The camp's long-haired torturer pours a bottle of poison into 
   the open wound (we know it's poison because the bottle has a picture 
   of a skull and crossbones on it!) and the poor buried sap screams out 
   in pain (we hear a bubbling sound as he screams). The man is in so 
   much pain, he manages to jump out of his dirt-filled hole before he 
   dies! The rest of the film is a series of tortures, escapes and 
   retribution, as members of the squad are beaten, hung upside-down, 
   and bloodily abused. Nguyen (who has his hands impaled together) 
   manages to escape , by painfully pulling his hands down and removing 
   the spike the hard way, and frees his comrades. Nguyen recuperates 
   from his wounds and then leads his men on another convoy mission. On 
   their way back, they hear on the radio that the war is over, but they 
   are ambushed by the enemy (I guess they didn't hear). Some of the men 
   are recaptured by the long-haired torturer, while Nguyen and the rest 
   of his squad must traverse a boobytrap-filled jungle. Nguyen makes it 
   back to safety and hires some soldiers of fortune to free his friends 
   when the Americans refuse to help (The war is over after all). They 
   manage to save one comrade and kill the long-haired torturer. Be 
   prepared for an ironic and pathos-filled ending. I laughed so hard, I 
   nearly split my pants!&nbsp; This Hong Kong action film doesn't have 
   much to offer the viewer besides tons of hilariously-bad dialogue and 
   a few good deaths, but you'll have to slog through some boring spots 
   to get there. The worst (and most confusing) parts of the film 
   concerns a strip club bar girl who is constantly berating customers 
   about loyalty and how her &quot;dreams have been shattered&quot;. It 
   makes no sense. The whole film in general makes no sense, as 
   director/co-scripter Jobic Wong (who seems to have no other 
   directorial credits, but plenty of acting roles) tells the story in 
   such a fragmented manner, it's hard to keep up. One minute Nguyen and 
   his men are being tortured and the next minute we're watching a bunch 
   of men on motorcycles trying to ride underneath a moving logging 
   truck to win a $40,000 cash prize (one guy gets crushed under the 
   wheels of the truck). It's confusing as hell, as if we're watching a 
   film through the eyes of a retard. There are some pretty decent death 
   and torture scenes, including the aforementioned poison scene, a guy 
   getting cut in half with a manual tree saw, a pickaxe impalement, a 
   beheading and a guy (whose mouth is forced open) being made to drink 
   water until he looks like he's pregnant (it's a riff of a scene from <B><A HREF="caligula_1979.htm">CALIGULA</A></B> 
   - 1979). The problem is, most of these scenes come in the film's 
   final twenty minutes. I could have done without the live rat on fire 
   scene, though (It's plain to see that Hong Kong never heard of the 
   ASPCA). Sam J. Jones is wasted in his role and disappears through 
   most of the film. He doesn't take part in any of the action until the 
   conclusion. Speaking of the conclusion, the final three minutes are 
   so heavy-handed and unexpected, you'll probably vacate your bowels 
   due to the ridiculousness of it all. As far as this film goes, this 
   will probably best sum it up: Watch it for the deaths, stay for the 
   brain damage. Not to be confused with the Peter Fonda-starrer <B><A HREF="jungle_heat_1983.htm">JUNGLE

   includes General Douglas Conrad (Mike Monty) as a passenger, is 
   ambushed by the VC in South Vietnam in 1968, the General and some of 
   his men are taken prisoner and kept in cages in a secret underground 
   tunnel. The U.S. Government sends five elite &quot;Tunnel Rats&quot; 
   to rescue the General, which consists of team leader John

   to retreat (Rayo says, &quot;There are a lot of gooks out 
   there!&quot;). When Scout is leading them on a new course, he steps 
   on a land mine, but Smith saves him by using a boulder to replace 
   Scout's weight (If Rayo had his way, he would rather see Scout blow 
   up in a million pieces.). The group meet their inside contact, Mai 
   (Marilyn Lang), in a deserted shack in the jungle (She says to Rayo, 
   &quot;Don't call me bitch!&quot;, when he wants to kill her) and she 
   takes them down river to the entrance of the tunnel. Meanwhile, 
   General Conrad&nbsp; and his men are being tortured (They deliver a 
   human heart to the General's cell and tell him it belongs to one of 
   his men!) and the exasperated General makes a tape recording 
   renouncing the United States' role in the war to make the killing of 
   his men stop. (Turns out the the gooks tricked him, as the heart 
   delivered to his cell wasn't a human one after all.). After Smith and 
   his squad split up to check out some &quot;spider holes&quot; (small 
   tunnels manned by Vietcong snipers), they capture female enemy 
   soldier Votimo (Nancy Hung), who is about to give them the General's 
   location when Rayo rapes and kills her. The squad finally rescue the 
   General, but not before Mai, Ellis, Benson and Rayo (who comes down 
   with a case of tunnel fever) are all killed, either by the enemy or 
   at their own squad's hands.&nbsp; This Filipino war action film, 
   directed by Teddy Page (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Blood Debts">BLOOD
    DEBTS</A></B> - 1983), using the pseudonym &quot;Irvin Johnson&quot;,
    is a pretty good action flick that has lots of firefights, 
   explosions and even a few surprisingly graphic bits of male and 
   female nudity. Filled with plenty of familiar faces in 
   Philippines-lensed action films, it's nice to see Jim Gaines (<B><A HREF="#Rescue Team">RESCUE

   - 1986) get a big role for a change, probably because he wrote the 
   uncredited screenplay. Since he's the protangonist of the group (he 
   doesn't trust anyone and wants to kill everyone and everything that 
   gets in his way), he gets the best lines and does the most outrageous 
   things (including the rape of Votimo, whom he brazenly kills before 
   she can tell them the General's location and the cold-blooded murder 
   of fellow squad member Ellis, whom he shoots just for being injured 
   by enemy fire!). When he finally goes full-tilt crazy in a spider 
   hole and tries to kill Smith, his death becomes one of the film's 
   strangest moments. His story is the film's most engaging and director 
   Page wisely devotes the lion's share of screen time on him. You're 
   really not to sure what to make of him until the rape/murder of 
   Votimo, when he reveals that he's nothing but a psychopath in a 
   military uniform. If you like fast-paced war films, with plenty of 
   bullet squibs and explosions (the slow-motion shot of Smith 
   outrunning shacks blowing up behind him in the finale is quite 
   impressive, as is Benson's self-sacrifice, where he takes out a slew 
   of gooks while holding an active grenade), you could do a lot worse

    While they both do heroic deeds (Gortner grabs a gun off a merc; 
   Wulff comes to Van Pallandt's defense), they both suffer horrible 
   graphic deaths for their acts of bravery. This German-financed, 
   Mexico-lensed action film is short on logic (there's nothing like 
   rape to turn mousey, high-maintenance women into non-stop killing 
   machines) and has underdeveloped characters (Woody Strode's mute 
   character is a waste and all the models are interchangable), but 
   there's enough nudity, mindless carnage (John Vernon's death is a 
   highlight) and goofy dialogue (One guy says to Santiago, &quot;Fatman!
    Pig! You sleep with your sister!&quot; to which he replies, 
   &quot;She's only my half-sister, you know!&quot;) to keep you 
   entertained. I was taken aback by the level of violence here, 
   although it is apparent that some scenes (the mass rape and Vernon's 
   death in particular) were trimmed to achieve an R rating. Look very 
   closely after big Paul L. Smith (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#DeathChase">DEATH
    CHASE</A></B> - 1987) rips the door off the helicopter and lifts 
   John Vernon (door and all!) into the spinning blades. Although we 
   don't see the actual act, there is a shot very shortly thereafter of 
   Vernon's headless, bloody body lying on the ground as Smith takes off 
   in the helicopter. Smith's fight with one of Vernon's goons, where 
   Smith is shot, stabbed and has a bottle broken over his head and he 
   still comes back for more, is also a highlight. One thing that is not 
   a highlight is the theme song, sung by Marina Arcangeli, that plays 
   over the opening and closing credits. Arcangeli sings like someone is 
   tightening thumbscrews to her. It's a screeching, ear-splitting mess.

    he needs to track down and kill Ernst and his squad. The first one 
   to die is David, who is lured out of a bar by a paid-off hooker and 
   taken to a secluded section of town, where he is murdered by Titleman 
   with multiple throwing darts to his body (Titleman is an excellent 
   darts player), the final dart puncturing his eye when he refuses to 
   tell Titleman where the gold is. Titleman next sends some well-paid 
   Vietnamese troops to Ernst's home, where they kill his wife (they 
   shoot her in the back), but Cisco and Mark arrive in time to save 
   Ernst's ass. All bets are off, as both sides hunt each other down, 
   using torture (Mark shoves a switchblade in the hooker's mouth and 
   threatens to slit her mouth at the sides if she doesn't tell him who 
   ordered David's death), gunplay and explosives to achieve their 
   goals. Ernst kidnaps Titleman's girlfriend Helen (Cristine Leigh) and 
   threatens to kill her if Titleman doesn't fork over guns and 
   ammunition for Afghan rebels fighting for the freedom of their 
   country (Ernst is a big supporter of a free Afghanistan). When 
   Titleman calls his bluff and tells Ernst to kill her, Helen helps 
   Ernst and his squad raid Titleman's compound, which is full of 
   high-tech weapons and ammunition. Something tells me that there's

   (a line actually spoken by Titleman to describe Ernst) is sure to 
   please fans of war action films. It contains more bloody deaths than 
   you can shake a stick at and numerous action set-pieces, including 
   sequences set in such locales as a deserted amusement park, a Vietnam 
   nightclub (where Titleman expects to be entertained by a comedian, 
   but views two of his men hanging dead by their necks on stage 
   instead) and Titleman's compound in the finale. What I found 
   particularly strange about this film is the undercurrent of German 
   bias on display here, from Ernst's family history (Was his father a 
   Nazi or not? I'm afraid we never find out.), to Titleman constantly 
   referring to Ernst as &quot;The Kraut&quot;. There are allusions to 
   Ernst and his family changing their names when they moved to America, 
   but it is never expounded upon. Also unusual is that even though 
   Titleman is the villain here, he shows a huge amount of respect for 
   Ernst, even dressing in his old military uniform for the climatic 
   showdown. Even then, when Titleman has the drop on Ernst, he refuses 
   to fire his weapon. When Cisco fatally wounds Titleman, he tells 
   Ernst that he wouldn't have pulled the trigger, but all Ernst does is 
   give him a look of disgust and turns his back on him, which makes me 
   wonder who is actually the villain of this piece. Food for thought, 
   especially if Ernst is a card-carrying Nazi. Still, if you enjoy 
   seeing people getting riddled with bullets and watching things

   defects that are far from perfect and I'm glad to report that <B><A HREF="keeper_2009b.htm">THE

   hiring a director known for making offbeat films and a screenplay 
   that's not afraid to go places that may make the viewer feel a bit 
   queasy. Don't get me wrong, this is an action film first and 
   foremost, but it has a human heart that has been missing from the 
   Seagal canon for years. In this film, Seagal portrays Roland 
   Sallinger, an L.A. cop who is shot by his crooked partner, Trevor 
   (Brian Keith Gamble), when the temptation of two million dollars 
   sitting on a table of a drug bust gone bad is too much for him to 
   pass-up. When Roland still has a pulse after back-up arrives and he 
   is taken to the hospital, Trevor heads to the hospital to make sure 
   that Roland doesn't spill the beans. Roland fakes a coma and uses his 
   backup weapon to shoot Trevor dead when he tries to smot<A HREF="keeper_2009.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/keeper 2009 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="223" HEIGHT="316" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>her
    him with a pillow. Roland works hard to rehabilitate from his 
   injuries (even if he has grown dependent on painkillers) so he can 
   get back to work, but when a year passes and the police force him to 
   retire for medical reasons, Roland finds himself out of a job. That 
   doesn't last for long, though, as Roland's good friend, former Texas 
   cop and rich businessman Conner Wells (Stephan Duvall), asks for his 
   help in protecting his socialite daughter Nikita (Liezl Carstens), 
   who was just a victim of an unsuccessful kidnap attempt. Nikita is 
   also the girlfriend of up-and-coming boxer Mason Silver (Arron 
   Shiver), who proved himself a coward when Nikita was being kidnapped 
   (he ran away as fast as he could). Roland accepts the job and on the 
   limo ride to Conner's mansion, limo driver Manuelo (Johnny Hector) 
   sees his cousin Allegra (Kisha Sierra) being roughed-up by two goons, 
   so Roland takes care of the two thugs (in the usual Seagal arm-and-wrist-bending
    manner), earning the respect and gratitude of Manuelo and Allegra 
   (he'll need it later on). Roland dons a cowboy hat and becomes 
   Nikita's personal bodyguard and, at first, Nikita objects to having a 
   babysitter, but once she sees with her own eyes how he can take care 
   of himself (a dustup with a few goons at a disco), she soon comes to 
   respect and depend on Roland, even developing a crush on him (that's 
   the queasy part). Conner feels someone within his organization is a 
   traitor, so Roland updates the mansion's security system and makes 
   Nikita wear a necklace that's also a transponder. Roland doesn't care 
   to much for Mason, who mistreats Nikita, snorts cocaine off of other 
   sluts' breasts and is on the payroll of Conner's rival, Jason Cross 
   (Luce Rains), even though Conner is financing his boxing career. 
   Cross is also a violent separatist, who believes that Whites and 
   Mexicans shouldn't mix (he apparently has no problem with a naked, 
   big-breasted Latino girl giving him a back rub, though). Roland, on 
   the other hand, gets along with everyone and grows fond of Manuelo 
   and his extended family. When Nikita is eventually successfully 
   kidnapped (Was there any doubt?) with Mason's help, Roland must 
   figure out what Conner's relationship to Cross really is (it has 
   something to do with uranium rights) while trying to get Nikita 
   safely back with Manuelo and Allegra's brothers' help. Step One: 
   Teach Mason a lesson he will not soon forget. Step Two: Make everyone 
   else feel the pain they deserve.&nbsp; This is a good, old-fashioned 
   action film with a lot of human moments, especially between Roland 
   and Nikita. While the idea of a romance developing between the two 
   may seem a little creepy due to the age difference (thankfully, it 
   never happens), director Keoni Waxman (<B><A HREF="serial_bomber_1996.htm">SERIAL

    DANGEROUS MAN</A></B> - 2009, also starring Seagal) and screenwriter 
   Paul A. Birkett toss-in a lot of personal, emotional drama into the 
   action mix, something missing from Seagal's films for a long time. 
   This is probably Seagal's best film in the last ten years for that 
   fact alone, as he sheds his trademark ponytail and actually tries to 
   act (I'm not saying that he's successful, but at least he is 
   trying!). Although the plot device of his dependence on painkillers 
   is dropped as soon as he agrees to become Nikita's bodyguard, there 
   are plenty of other unusual personal touches on view, such as Roland 
   and Manuelo watching Nikita puking her guts out by the side of the 
   limosine in what Manuelo describes as her &quot;typical Friday night 
   out&quot; or the conversation between Nikita and Roland as she eats 
   half his sandwich. That's not to say that the action is sacrificed, 
   though, as there are plenty of gunfights (lots of bloody bullet 
   squibs), car chases, stabbings and Seagal's brand of martial arts 
   fighting (which he does on his own here, without the use of obvious 
   stunt doubles seen in his other recent outings). Here's hoping that 
   Mr. Seagal sticks with this type of action flick (something with a 
   little heart) and doesn't fall back to his usual lazy ways. If you

   the opening minutes of this crazy action film from Thailand, a cop 
   named Ching Ming is chasing a bunch of crooks, who dump barrels of 
   gasoline from their truck into the middle of the road and blow them 
   up with their guns, forcing Ching to crash his car. After getting a 
   tip that the crooks are hiding out in a lumber yard, Ching goes there 
   and defeats the crooks with his <A HREF="killer_elephants_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/killer elephants french vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="138" HEIGHT="192" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>superior
    kung-fu skills (he kills one guy by throwing a pitchfork into his 
   stomach) and with the assist of Cal Fei, an ex-friend of Ching's who 
   was framed for murder and is now on Ching's most wanted list. Cal Fei 
   is in charge of a gang of rebels who hide out in the jungle and use 
   elephants to do their dirty work (Early on, we watch as one elephant 
   uses his tusks to toss around the Police Captain's car like it was 
   made of balsa wood). The man who framed Cal Fei for murder is known 
   simply as &quot;The Boss&quot; (a name used for most crooked bigshots 
   in films from this region), a crime kingpin who has his horse-riding 
   bandits burn down villages so he can buy the land cheap. The Boss is 
   also public enemy #1 on Ching's most wanted list and he tries to kill 
   Ching and Cal Fei every opportunity he gets. On one such occasion, 
   The Boss sends a bunch of men to kill Cal Fei in his jungle hideout, 
   only to have all but one of his men killed by Cal Fei's rebels, by 
   gunshot, a knife through the neck and an axe to the head (The lone 
   surviving bandit runs into the elephants and one rebel says to him, 
   &quot;Do you wanna give up or would you rather fight the 
   elephants?&quot; to which the bandit replies, &quot;Yes, I think I'll 
   give up!&quot;). To complicate matters, Cal Fei kidnaps The Boss's 
   wife Jo and holds her in his jungle hideout, but since Jo and Cal Fei 
   use to be lovers, they reignite their passion for each other and she 
   becomes pregnant. Ching and Cal Fei also have a rivalry because, even 
   though Ching knows Cal Fei was framed, Ching considers it his duty to 
   bring Cal Fei in, which leads to a series of fights between the two 
   (which Cal Fei always seems to win). It becomes apparent after not 
   too long that if The Boss is to be brought to justice, Ching and Cal 
   Fei will have to learn to work with each other. When Jo goes into 
   labor, Ching rushes her to the hospital, where she has a baby girl.

    confusing turn of events, The Boss ends up dead and his replacement 
   kidnaps Jo, the baby and Ching's wife, which necessitates that Ching 
   and Cal Fei use the elephants to perform a rescue. It all ends with 
   the bad guys being defeated by a stampede of elephants and Ching 
   jumping out of a helicopter to save his wife.&nbsp; This 
   Thailand-lensed film, directed by Som Kit (who doesn't seem to have 
   any other film credits, but since this is a Thai film, I'm sure he 
   has plenty we in the West have never heard of), doesn't make an ounce 
   of sense, but it is so weird and out-there, you can't help but fall 
   for it's charms. It is filled with outrageous scenes, such as a naked 
   girl in body paint who dances in a nightclub for no other reason than 
   to show us a naked girl in body paint dancing in a nightclub; the 
   Elephant Carnival, where we watch pachyderms playing soccer with a 
   giant ball or competing in a game of Tug-Of-War with a bunch of men; 
   and the confusing death of The Boss in the middle of the film, where 
   a character not seen before named Mau Chien shoots The Boss and takes 
   his place (Did the actor who plays The Boss quit halfway through the 
   film?). The English dubbing is a hoot, my favorite exchange being 
   between the Chief of Police and one of his cops. When Jo escapes from 
   the hospital, thanks to an elephant crashing through the wall of her 
   room, the Chief asks the cop, &quot;Where'd she go?&quot; The cop 
   looks at him and says, &quot;How the hell do I know?&quot; Simply 
   priceless. There's really not much elephant destruction until the 
   finale, where they destroy an entire village, but there's plenty of 
   other blood and weirdness to keep the viewer highly entertained for 
   82 minutes. You haven't truly lived until you witness a man throwing 
   grenades while riding on an elephant's back. Also known as <B><A HREF="rumbling_the_elephant_1976.htm">RUMBLING

   a cigarette in his mouth (he can't even do that convincingly) and the 
   strange mixture of American and Spanish actors in French locations. 
   It is particularly distressing to see the late Margaux Hemingway in 
   this, as her face is ravaged by her real-life alcohol abuse and she 
   looks obliterated in every scene she's in. She committed suicide in 
   1996 by an overdose of Klonopin, further cementing the &quot;Hemingway
    Curse&quot; (she was the fifth member of the Hemingway clan to 
   commit suicide). The violence is much too restrained for a revenge 
   thriller, as the camera pulls back on the violence when it should be 
   moving in closer. George (Jorge) Rivero is a pretty weak action hero 
   here, because we never feel his pain of losing his wife. I was more 
   drawn to his thick, porn-style moustache, which seemed to out-act the 
   rest of his body. <B><A HREF="killing_machine_1984b.htm">KILLING MACHINE</A></B> 
   is a pretty tepid affair, offering only a few fiery explosions, a 
   smattering of blood, a brief glimpse of nudity and lots of bad 
   acting. The film is also technically sloppy, as the leg of a crew 
   member can be spotted during the fight between Rivero and Stiglitz 
   and camera and microphone shadows can be viewed in several scenes.

   Walker (Tony Kendall; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LoreleysGrasp1973">THE
    LORELEY'S GRASP</A></B> - 1973), a.k.a. &quot;Kommissar X&quot;, 
   joins a reluctant Tom in his search for Arthur Tracy and the missing 
   jewels.&nbsp; A sickly Robert Tracy (Fantasia again) is worried that 
   his twin brother will come visit him. Even more worried is Robert's 
   wife Elizabeth (Erika Blanc; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DevilsNightmare1971">THE
    DEVIL'S NIGHTMARE</A></B> - 1971), who was once Arthur's girlfriend, 
   telling Robert that she wants nothing to do with Arthur and if she 
   sees him she will call the police. Robert's nurse, Emily Lambert 
   (Corny Collins; <B><A HREF="high_season_for_spies_1966.htm">HIGH 
   SEASON FOR SPIES</A></B> - 1966), thanks Robert for the loan he is 
   about to give her. He is donating his prized possession, the statue 
   of the three blue panthers, to a local museum, the proceeds from the 
   donation to fund Emily's loan (Can this even be considered a 
   &quot;donation&quot;???), Robert having no idea that the key to the 
   safety deposit box is inside the statue.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    At the rodeo, we see some less-than-western attractions, such as a 
   man flying via a jet pack (!) and Tom as one of the bronco riders (it 
   turns out that he accidentally falls backwards on to a bucking bronco 
   and outlasts most of the professional riders!). Tom is alerted that 
   Arthur is leaving the rodeo, only it isn't Arthur, it's his double 
   and Tom watches as his car explodes by a remote controlled bomb put 
   in the car by Anthony and Smoky. Tom believes his search for Arthur 
   is over, but Jo is at the rodeo in disguise (wearing a gaucho and a 
   large floppy sombrero!) and overhears Anthony on the phone, telling 
   Arthur that they are heading to Robert's house in Montreal, so he 
   goes there, too. Jo, who is irresistable to women, makes friends with 
   Emily and has her pretend that he is her cousin &quot;Joe Romeo&quot; 
   (!), so he can meet Robert. Tom soon learns that the burned body in 
   the exploded car is not Arthur, so his search is back on. Jo follows 
   Robert to the rodeo and when Tom sees Jo pretending to be a 
   pickpocket, he has him arrested (throughout the series, they are 
   always playing practical jokes on each other). Jo tells Tom that if 
   he wants to find Arthur, he better let him join his team. Tom 
   reluctantly agrees, so they become a crimefighting team once again.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Robert meets Arthur on the tram ride of the Expo '67 World's Fair in 
   Montreal (I was there and it brought back many long-forgotten 
   memories, such as I suffered from a bad case of explosive diarrhea! 
   It was still a wonderful place to visit, cleaner than any city I have 
   ever been to. Whatever happened to the World's Fair?) The only 
   difference between Arthur and Robert is that Robert has a mustache, 
   so Arthur shoots and kills his brother on the tram ride, steals his 
   clothes and applies a fake mustache, telling the police that he has 
   just shot and killed his fugitive brother. The fake Robert then goes 
   on his merry way, only when he goes to his brother's house and kisses 
   Elizabeth, she knows that he isn't her husband. Elizabeth threatens 
   to call the police, so Arthur has Anthony and Smoky hold her prisoner 
   in her own home. Arthur can't find the statue, not knowing that his 
   brother donated it to a museum. Emily tells Jo that Robert is acting 
   strangely and also tells him about the statue, so Jo puts two and two 
   together, but it won't be easy because the bad guys know he is there. 
   A thug in a wetsuit tries to kill Jo, but he gets the upper hand. 
   Before he can tell Jo who sent him, Anthony shoots him in the back 
   with a speargun bolt, killing him (copying a scene from the earlier <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#SoDarlingDeadly1966">SO
    DARLING, SO DEADLY</A></B> - 1966). Their investigation leads Tom 
   and Jo to a karate school, where Tom single-handedly beats the snot 
   out of over a dozen students. Elizabeth escapes from Anthony and 
   Smoky, telling Jo and Tom that she doesn't know where the jewels are, 
   but by the way Anthony and Smoky were acting, she believes they are 
   in a safety deposit at the bank, but she has no idea where the key 
   is. Jo and Tom go to Robert's house to look for the key, finding 
   Arthur's dead body instead, the victim of cyanide poisoning. But who 
   killed him? Was it Elizabeth? Or could it be Emily? How about his two 
   partners in crime? It's not hard to figure out, as Anthony and Smoky 
   take Emily hostage when they discover that the safety deposit box is 
   empty. Emily tells them that she put the stolen jewels inside the 
   three blue panthers statue, so they head to the museum to steal the 
   statue., with Jo and Tom not far behind. It all ends with a good 
   old-fashioned shoot-out and fistfight at a ghost town, <A HREF="kill_panther_kill_1968.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/kill panther kill german dvd4a front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="214" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>mimicking

   will say is that you will never see it coming. But it's the chemistry

   show us his comedy chops, something he was unable to do in the many

   somewhat of an overbearing brat that is full of herself, finally

   spouts her racist views on &quot;pigs&quot; (this girl needs a good 
   slapping around). To shut her up, Doug takes her downstairs to gamble 
   and have some dinner. She turns $20 into a small fortune at the 
   blackjack table, buys some funky clothes at the casino store and has 
   dinner with a newlywed couple that they meet in the store (they are 
   not what they seem to be). It's not long before Cocoa and Doug fall 
   in love (I would have slugged her a good one instead). She betrays 
   Doug when she ducks out on dinner to meet gangster boyfriend Eddie in 
   a hotel room upstairs. Eddie basically betrays her and sets her up 
   for a sniper's bullet. Can Doug and Ramsey save her in time and get 
   her to the Grand Jury in one piece? There's a major deception at the 
   end that could spell doom for our too-spoiled-for-words heroine, but 
   good money says that you would have turned it off or fallen asleep

   mark), <B><A HREF="lady_cocoa_1974b.htm">LADY COCOA</A></B> plays 
   more like a clash-of-personalities tale, and a pretty bad one at 
   that. Las Vegas lounge star Lola Falana starts to get on your nerves 
   as spoiled bitch Cocoa, who always says something hurtful and makes 
   it difficult for the two cops to look after her. Disobeying their 
   every order, you'll be wishing that the hitmen would finish their job 
   as quickly as possible, especially when she yells lines of dialogue 
   like, &quot;I'm going to shit, shower and shampoo!&quot; (add 
   &quot;shut up&quot; to that and I would have been a happy man). She 
   is the ideal description of the word &quot;cunt&quot; (which some 
   sharp guy calls her in this). There's an unintentionally funny scene 
   where Doug chases the newlywed couple (who turn out to be a hit team) 
   on foot while they are in a car. The car flips over, drives into a 
   casino, exits out the back door and lands in a swimming pool. The guy 
   behind the wheel drowns, but the girl (played by Millie Perkins) gets 
   out and Doug chases her into a bathroom, where they fire at each

   partners in Casper's gymnasium business. You just know that isn't 
   going to last very long. Napoleon imports a fighter called Cannon 
   (Peter Dempster) to replace Roo in the illegal circle fights, while 
   his legitimate prize fighter Razor (Real Andrews) rises in the ranks 
   as a champion boxer (There's a lot of bad blood between Roo and 
   Razor). Roo begins falling in love with tomboyish mechanic Charlie 
   (Sonja Belliveau), who works at her father Gus' (Danny Burnes) garage 
   next door (and she's a pretty good boxer, to boot), but a violent 
   episode in Roo's past (we see fragments of it in flashback footage) 
   prevents him from consummating the relationship. A series of events, 
   including Gus owing Napoleon a fortune in gambling debts and Tunny 
   putting the pressure on Napoleon, forces Roo to fight Razor in a 
   circle match. Casper is disappointed, but agrees once again to be his 
   trainer/ringman, as Roo begins to fight a series of punishing circle 
   matches (he actually loses his first fight to Cannon). When Cannon 
   cripples Casper outside the ring and Razor leaves Napoleon for a 
   better manager, Napoleon and Tunny force Roo to fight a rematch with 
   Cannon or else they will throw him back in the loony bin (those 
   flashbacks Roo has been having are when he spent eight years in a 
   padded cell for killing a guy in a bar fight). With Charlie as his 
   corner(wo)man, Roo begins his road to retribution, first with his 
   rematch with Cannon and then with boxer Razor.&nbsp; This is a 
   thoroughly predictable 80's fight actioner, directed by Damien Lee (<B><A HREF="food_of_the_gods_part_2_1989.htm">FOOD
    OF THE GODS PART 2</A></B> - 1989; <B><A HREF="abraxas_guardian_of_the_universe_1990.htm">ABRAXIS,

   producer David Mitchell. The fight scenes are brutal, but not very 
   well choreographed and Vernon Wells sleepwalks through his role. The 
   scenes that should resonate with viewers, such as when Roo is forced 
   to fight his friend Batty (which ends with Batty committing 
   suicide!), falls flatter than a yeast-free pancake. As a matter of 
   fact, the only people who show any real emotion are Michael Copeman 
   as Napoleon and Franco Columbo as Batty (and, really, when have you 
   ever heard that before? Here's a question to ponder: Was he called 
   &quot;Batty&quot; before or after he lost his marbles? I'm only 
   asking because if he was called Batty before he had his brain

   &quot;Might as well call him Batty because he doesn't look like he'll

   else walks around in a somnambulistic state and William Sanderson's 
   role is so underwritten, a chimp could have played it. This is not 
   one of the better low-budget 80's actioners, so my advice would be to 
   avoid it unless you are a Vernon Wells fan. Even then, it's one of 
   his minor 80's flicks. Also starring Kim Coates (basically a cameo),

   there is no bail and Susan could end up in prison for five to twelve

   that Susan is freed, but it is plain to see all he wants is a huge 
   payday for doing nothing (and we never see him in the film after

    Cliff then phones the Coach to tell him what is going on, the Coach 
   telling him he's taking the next flight to the island nation. When 
   Cliff meets him at the airport the next morning, he's surprised to 
   see the entire football team has come with the Coach. They want to do 
   everything they can, even breaking all known laws, to get Susan out 
   of prison. While the Coach and Cliff are talking, the Head Guard 
   breaks into Cliff's hotel room, gun in hand. Instead of shooting 
   Cliff and the Coach, he offers to help in freeing Susan if they will 
   take his nine-year-old son back to America with them, as he wants his 
   son to have an American life full of money and prosperity! They agree 
   and what happens next is absurdity at its finest!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The football team comes up with a plan to free Susan from the prison 
   (Coach has brought a &quot;pile of money&quot; with him so they can 
   buy automatic weapons and other instruments of death), so they dress 
   in their football uniforms (!), complete with shoulder pads and 
   helmets (!!) and lay seige to the prison, with Coach calling all the 
   plays from a helicopter (!!!). They take on scores of prison guards, 
   killing them while firing their weapons and grenade launchers until 
   they get to the Prison Warden's office, where he is holding Susan 
   captive. Cliff uses a grenade launcher to blow a hole in the floor of 
   the office (Coach telling him exactly where to shoot the hole, as if 
   he could see through the walls!), climbs through it and shoots the 
   Prison Warden dead. Cliff grabs Susan and they, and the entire 
   football team, get into the helicopter (!!!!) and fly to the airport, 
   where a plane is waiting for them to fly to America. Just when it 
   looks like everyone is going to escape with their lives, a barrage of 
   bullets from outside slice into the airplane, hitting Coach in the 
   back and he dies while giving a moving (?) speech to Cliff, Susan and 
   his football team. We then see Cliff and the team playing a very 
   close football game (we also see Susan, George and the nine-year-old 
   son of the Head Prison Guard in the crowd), where they are losing in 
   the final seconds. Cliff looks to the sideline and sees Coach giving 
   him the thumbs-up, giving him the strength to throw the winning pass 
   as the game ends. Aww, don't you just love happy endings?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   once again uses his &quot;Larry Ludman&quot; pseudonym. It's also 
   apparent that the screenwriting team Gianfranco Clerici and Vincenzo

   nothing about American football and don't bother to give most of the 
   characters proper names (In all fairness, it looks like Martin 
   Balsam, Charles Napier and Henry Silva filmed their scenes in one day 
   or less for a quick paycheck and to give this film some &quot;name 
   value&quot;). Even Ernest Borgnine can't believe the words that are 
   coming out of his mouth, as in one scene, after saying something 
   incredulous and mind-bending, he turns his head to the side and 
   blurts out, &quot;What?&quot;, as if he couldn't believe what he just 
   said! This film also has a very cheap look to it, but that's not 
   surprising, because Italian genre films in the early-'90s had to work 
   with threadbare budgets. Most of the action scenes in this film were 
   cribbed from De Angelis' previously-mentioned <B><A HREF="operation_nam_1985.htm">OPERATION

   bloody bullet hits. Still, the weirdness factor is there for fans of 
   stupid cinema, especially fans of Fabrizio De Angelis awfulness. You 
   know who you are, so don't try hiding your faces, we can see you! 
   Seriously though, this action film is as bad as they come, so all

   the villagers to work in the rice patties unaccompanied, only to have 
   some VC soldiers disguise themselves as villagers and lead an attack 
   on the camp. Just when the prospects look bad for Sgt. Martin and his 
   men, Lieutenant and his commandos show up in the nick of time and 
   save the day. A short time later, a helicopter arrives carrying 
   Captain Barrett, who has a top-secret meeting with Lieutenant. The 
   Captain reveals that a French traitor named Bernard is supplying the 
   enemy with weapons, so the Captain and Lieutenant head alone into the 
   jungle to find Bernard, not to kill him, but to make him an offer he 
   cannot refuse (Lieutenant smells a rat and doesn't trust the 
   Captain). Lieutenant was right not to trust the Captain, because when 
   the Captain goes to meet Bernard alone, a squad of doped-up American 
   AWOL soldiers tries to ambush Lieutenant, but he manages to kill them 
   with some well-placed explosives. Sgt. Martin, Bob (Robert Marius; <B><A HREF="#CopGame1988">COP

   go on a recon mission and discover a series of VC tunnels in the

   recruit when they flush the VCs out of the tunnels. Lieutenant 
   discovers that Capt. Barrett is actually a traitor, too, partners 
   with Bernard (who the Captain kills to keep quiet), so he gathers up 
   his commandos to kill the Captain and his VC allies before the 
   Captain has them all killed to cover-up his treachery. The finale 
   finds Lieutenant, his commandos and Sgt. Martin's freshly-trained

   explosions and even some heartwarming moments (including Sgt. Martin 
   letting the new recruit listen to his wife's pornographic audio 
   cassette) to keep the viewer entertained. I was impressed that some 
   of Lieutenant's commandos are painted as rather heartless and 
   inhumane. Tony likes to rape Vietnamese women and disregards 
   Lieutenant's orders to leave the women alone. Tony rapes one village 
   woman (Tania Gomez; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#MagicOfTheUniverse">MAGIC

   injured husband, so it should come as no surprise that during the 
   final battle, Tony is killed when the husband plants a knife in his 
   back. In fact, the only likable Americans here are Lieutenant, Sgt. 
   Martin and Bob, as the rest are either corrupt (Captain Barrett), 
   drug addicts, AWOL soldiers or mercenaries (Bernard's men) or a pimp 
   (Mike). The nihilistic finale leaves no doubt as to everyone's fates 
   (Bob gets the most heroic death, being gunned-down while holding a 
   small boy's bullet-ridden body after failing to protect him), but 
   what comes before it is also very violent, as people are blown apart, 
   shot or stabbed and everything explodes in nice, big fireballs. <B><A HREF="leathernecks_1988b.htm">LEATHERNECKS</A></B>

   scientist is terrorizing San Francisco in this crazy Italian actioner 
   from director Enzo G. Castellari. The scientist has developed a new 
   contraption called Light Blast, a portable weapon (using 
   microwave-like rays) that is capable of frying and melting any object 
   it comes in contact with. He first tests it out in a railroad yard, 
   dissolving a few railway cars as well as a necking couple carrying on

   slugs into Ronn's driver after a small car chase. The scientist calls 
   the police and demands ten million dollars or he will unleash Light 
   Blast in a more populated area. As Ronn's investigation gets him 
   closer to the scientist (including a surreal shootout in a morgue), 
   the Mayor pays the ten million dollar ransom, only to have the police 
   mess it up, leading to an explosion killing all the cops following 
   the money. The next day, the Mayor receives a tape where the 
   scientist now demands twenty million dollars. When the scientist's 
   goons spray Ronn's house with machine gun fire and kill his wife 
   (Peggy Rowe) and wound his partner, it becomes personal and Ronn 
   becomes a one-man killing machine. After a shootout at a warehouse 
   where Ronn nearly gets crushed by a bulldozer, Ronn steals a (conveniently-placed)
    dune buggy and chases the scientist through the streets of San 
   Francisco. Ronn causes the Light Blast to malfunction, causing it to

   back of a moving pickup truck and tells the driver, &quot;I'm a cop.

   happens to him all the time! There's also another scene where he gets

   millions of dollars. It must be sabotage, as someone doesn't want the 
   United States to go to the Moon. The FSIC (Federal Security

   agent, Lt. Harry Sennet (Anthony Eisley; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NavyVsNightMonsters">THE

   her back), so he makes her a martini with one olive (shaken, not

   Patricia put on a show for him outside. Harry then catches Archie 
   searching his room and restrains him. Before Archie can talk, Mata 
   Hari shoots Archie and both he and Patricia follow her, not knowing 
   that a seriously wounded Archie has left Harry's room. Harry uses his 
   watch, which is also a geiger counter, to follow Archie, who is 
   slightly radioactive. It leads Harry and Patricia to an unusually 
   large basement, which then connects to an abandoned grain silo, as 
   the trail grows cold.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Suddenly, they are trapped inside the silo, as it begins to fill

   but it doesn't recede. Harry dives down to the bottom of the silo to 
   find a valve to drain the water, but the unknown man with the German 
   accents opens a portal, which sucks Harry outside. Harry then save 
   Patricia from drowning, which pisses-off the unknown man, vowing to 
   get even. Harry then pays Sylvia a visit and she points a gun at him 
   that shoots acid (&quot;You shouldn't have stuck your nose into our

   shoots and kills Sylvia (her gun shoots bullets) and both he and 
   Patricia watch as the silo they were just in explode. We then find 
   out that Mata Hari's name is Kary, and she works for the German man, 
   who tells her to keep a close eye on Harry. Harry discovers a secret

    Patricia calls Harry and tells him that another rocket is about to 
   be launched. Harry races to Cape Kennedy to stop the launch, but a 
   crowd of onlookers blocks his way (Remember when you would sit in 
   front of the TV to watch the latest rocket launch? I do, but it seems 
   that nowadays people don't care, believing it is a waste of 
   taxpayer's dollars. Stupid people!). Harry arrives too late, as the 
   rocket explodes, nearly killing Harry as flaming pieces of the rocket 
   fall to Earth, destroying his car (a well-done sequence, mixing stock 
   footage with some excellent miniature work, a specialty from this 
   film's director). The German man celebrates his latest victory by 
   popping a bottle of champagne, but why in the world is he exploding 
   the rockets?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   infiltrate Mr. Rehte's headquarters, but Archie, who is miraculousy 
   healed from the gunshot, is waiting for him. When Archie holds a gun 
   on Harry, he tells Archie that he has a pen with a transmitter that 
   will send his agency a notice of where he is. Archie checks out the 
   pen and is gassed, giving Harry enough time to grab his gun and shoot 
   Archie dead. Harry is then knocked out and when he wakes up, he 
   discovers that he is in a room with Professor Rooney, who is being 
   held captive by Mr. Rehte to develop a laser that will destroy 
   anything in its path, even hundreds of thousand miles away. Rooney 
   shows Harry the &quot;hibernation chamber&quot; where Mr. Rehte keeps 
   people in suspended animation to blackmail their family members to do 
   his bidding. Kary is one of those being blackmailed, as her father is 
   being held prisoner in the hibernation chamber. Harry then meets Mr. 
   Rehte, who tells Harry that very soon he will own Earth. Rehte's 
   hideout is directly beneath Cape Kennedy and he says that he is going 
   to launch his own rocket to the Moon, where he will place Professor 
   Rooney's laser, which will be pointed at Earth. Any country that

   Harry, who escapes, but Mr. Rehte captures Kary. Will Harry be able 
   to stop Mr. Rehte's evil plan and save Kary (and the Earth)? One 
   thing you can always depend on in Eurospy films is that the good guys 
   always win, but not without some blowback. The blowback here is Kary

   Everything about this film is cartoonish, but when Mr. Rehte kills 
   Kary's father and Kary herself, it throws the viewer for a loop, as 
   it runs opposite with the rest of the film. No one ever accused 
   Anthony Eisley of being a good actor and this film cements that 
   reputation, but he makes a serviceable action hero. What I also like 
   about this film is that everyone here speaks English and they dub 
   their own voices, unusual for an Italian production, but Margheriti 
   was no stranger to making films in the States. While nothing great, 
   it is still an enjoyable Eurospy romp. Shot under the title <B><A HREF="lightning_bolt_1966_foreign_ads.htm">OPERAZIONE

   isn't perfect, as it has the occasional emulsion scratch here and

   better than it does here, because Eurospy flicks are just not

   warden, tells Merill and the other new prisoners that escape is 
   useless and to prove his point, he shows them the half-eaten corpse 
   of a prisoner that tried to escape, only to end up as shark bait. 
   Almost immediately, Merill is attacked in the shower, but he manages 
   to fight them off. Merill is put in a cell with wise, old Uncle Coronad<A HREF="live_by_the_fist_1993.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/live by the fist vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="263" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>o
    (George Takei), a long-timer who takes Merill under his wing. He'll 
   need the help, because a lot of people in the joint want him dead, 
   including Alvarez (Romy Diaz), who was friends with the rapist Merill 
   killed. Alvarez has his Asian inmates attack Merill constantly, so 
   Warden Acosta assigns Merill to the all-white motorpool, run by white 
   supremacist Sacker (Ted Markland). When Merill saves a gook prisoner 
   from the wrath of Sacker and fellow missing-tooth mate Greasemonkey 
   (Nick Nicholson), he also becomes enemies with the white population. 
   Uncle Coronado tells Merill that Warden Acosta and his right-hand man 
   Vargas (Roland Dantes) are under investigation by a group called 
   Human Rights International, headed by Helen Ferris (Laura Albert). It 
   seems there have been 29 deaths in the prison in the last two years 
   and one of Uncle Coronado's friends stole a ledger that proves that 
   the Warden is stealing funds from the prison, but his friend was 
   killed before he told Coronado where he hid it. If Merill can find 
   the ledger and turn it over to Ms. Ferris when she arrives in one 
   week's time, he stands a good chance of being freed. Merill 
   eventually finds the ledger, but the Warden tries his best to kill 
   him before he has the chance of putting the ledger in Ms. Ferris' 
   hands. Good thing Merill is a champion martial artist, because both 
   the white and Asian prisoners assault him on a daily basis. Can Uncle 
   Coronado unite all the prisoners before a full-blown race riot breaks 
   out? It looks pretty grim when the Warden gets Sacker and Alvarez to 
   start a riot just as Ms. Ferris arrives at the prison, but Merill 
   steps in and dishes-out some much-deserved justice to all the guilty 
   parties just in the nick of time.&nbsp; This is the first of Filipino 
   director Cirio H. Santiago's trio of actioners he made with non-actor 
   Jerry &quot;Golden Boy&quot; Trimble in the early 90's , the others 
   being <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#OneManArmy">ONE MAN ARMY</A></B>

   (1994). Trimble is a terrible actor, but he is a decent martial 
   artist. He still gets hit more than any martial artist I have ever 
   seen in films (see if Steven Seagal or Jean-Claude Van Damme would 
   ever be allowed to take so many punches to the face and body as 
   Trimble does here), which at least makes his character much more 
   vunerable than you would normally see in these B-films. <B><A HREF="star_trek_1966.htm">STAR
    TREK</A></B>'s Mr. Sulu, George Takei, is the &quot;name&quot; actor 
   here and his character is the same type of person that was patented 
   so well by the late Mako in many films; namely, a wise, sage old man 
   who is the voice of reason. Takei is fine here, but I especially 
   liked the performance of Filipino staple Vic Diaz as Warden Acosta. 
   This is one of his biggest roles in the latter part of his career and 
   he's appropriately slimey as a man with no morals. <B>LIVE BY THE FIST</B>

    her in the face (she still doesn't let go of it!). Two undercover 
   cops, Tony (Ray Lovelock) and Fred (Marc Porel), witness the crime 
   and give chase on their motorcycles (Tony and Fred are initially seen 
   riding together on the same motorcycle until Tony steals one off the 
   street to join in the chase). This leads to a long motorcycle chase 
   through the city of Rome, as Tony and Fred chase the thieves up and 
   down stone steps, on the sidewalk and through a busy market (The 
   thieves even run over and kill a blind man's seeing eye dog as they 
   are crossing the street. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry!) 
   until the thieves crash into the back of a truck. One of the thieves 
   is killed instantly when he is impaled on the cycle's shifter (!) and 
   Fred snaps the other's neck after making sure he is 
   &quot;comfortable&quot;! As you can probably tell, Fred and Tony are 
   unconventional cops and are part of a &quot;Special Squad&quot; of 
   undercover lawmen, led by &quot;The Boss&quot; (Adolf Celi), that 
   deal with high profile robbery cases. Fred and Tony witness their 
   fellow cop, Rick (Marino Mase), being shotgunned to death in front of 
   their office, so they shoot one guy on a motorcycle in the back (he 
   hits a car, flips over the roof and is crushed when another car hits 
   him) and go after the man responsible, drug dealer Pasquini (Renato 
   Salvatore; <B><A HREF="omicron_1963.htm">OMICRON</A></B> - 1963). 
   They start off by burning down one of Pasquini's ritzy gambling 
   houses, which greatly pisses off Pasquini and he has one of his 
   crooked cops dig up all the information he can on Fred and Tony. 
   After Tony and Fred resolve a hostage situation at a private 
   residence (they kill all three hostage takers), they go after 
   Pasquini using any means necessary (even abusing Pasquini's innocent, 
   yet sex-starved, sister to get information on her brother). 
   Meanwhile, Pasquini is not sitting still. He uses a drug addict who 
   stole drugs from him (he has one of his goons manually remove one of 
   the addict's eyes!) to set-up Fred and Tony. The finale finds Fred 
   and Tony waiting for Pasquini on a docked boat wired with dynamite 
   and Pasquini has his hands on the plunger. Thankfully, Frank and Tony 
   have a guardian angel and he steps in to save the day.&nbsp; Director

   of blood and gore (including eye removal, impalements and plenty of

   is the implied homosexual relationship between Fred and Tony, even if 
   the producers made Fernando Di Leo (director of the excellent crime 
   film <B><A HREF="#Manhunt1972">MANHUNT</A></B> - 1972) tone down that 
   aspect in his script. They crack wise and make sexual remarks to The 
   Boss' sassy secretary Norma (Silvia Dionisio), but through all their 
   sexual innuendo and outright graphic talk (They banter about 
   deflowering their maid's underage daughter in front of the maid!), we 
   not once see them get cozy individually with a woman throughout the 
   entire film. One scene finds Fred slapping-around and feeling-up 
   Pasquini's sister and he eventually has sex with her, but then Tony 
   takes his turn when Fred is done. It seems they share everything, 
   including an apartment and a single motorcycle, which we see them 
   riding together at various times throughout the film. It's made very 
   clear how much they trust each other when they take target practice 
   in a quarry. They are on opposite ends shooting at cans inches away 
   from their bodies, sometimes firing their guns at each other while 
   rolling on the ground! It's also plain to see that if Fred and Tony 
   weren't policemen, they would make perfect hitmen. They have no 
   problem killing or torturing people to reach their objectives (One 
   scene shows Fred applying titty-twisters to two strung-up goons and 
   then using their bodies as punching bags when they won't give up 
   Pasquini's whereabouts). Ray Lovelock (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Let Sleeping Corpse">LET

   saving their asses in the explosive (and quick) finale. Some of the 
   English dubbing is risable (&quot;We are just sardines. What do we

    begin acting like a well-oiled machine, even earning the respect of

   their mission and trick out their Yamahas with machine guns and

   wondering), it becomes apparent that all the bikers were disgraced 
   soldiers returning to duty to settle old scores and find lost loves 
   as well as to serve their country for what they all know is a suicide 
   mission. Link also has a bad past with the American ambassador he is 
   hired to rescue, but he puts old gripes aside to do his duty. As a 
   matter of fact, all five bikers have good reasons to live, yet they 
   go on the mission anyway in what turns out to be a rousing, 
   action-packed rescue attempt. When one of the bikers deserts the 
   group and is ambushed and killed just hours before the assault is to

   as pathetic a human being you're ever likely to see. The fact that he 
   survives the blood-drenched finale will make your blood boil. 
   Although it takes a while for the film to get moving, the time is 
   well-spent as it fleshes the bikers' characters out so they become 
   people you actually care about. The script (by Alan Caillou; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#KingdomSpiders1977">KINGDOM
    OF THE SPIDERS</A></B> - 1977) makes some sharp political 
   statements, like the plight of abandoned American soldiers' love 
   children, something unusual for a film of this type and vintage. It 
   adds extra depth and meaning to the assault by the bikers, which is 
   well-staged and about as exciting a sequence you'll ever see in a 
   low-budget action flick. The cast of genre vets do a nice job here 
   and our old friend, Vic Diaz (who seems to appear in nearly every 
   film made in the Philippines), also puts in a turn as a mechanic who 
   doesn't understand English too well. This Joe Solomon-produced flick

   between Chinese gangsters and the Italian Mafia, rides a motorcycle 
   through various floors of the building and eventually escapes to 
   safety by motorized glider. Sam leaves a white glove at the scene of 
   the crime to make it look like the notorious English jewel thief 
   called &quot;White Glove&quot; committed the robbery. The Godfather 
   (a ridiculous-looking young white guy made-up to look fat and old, 
   not to mention sounding exactly like Marlon Brando) puts the squeeze 
   on White Glove to find the real thief and bring back the diamonds, 
   otherwise he will be sleeping with the fishes. Meanwhile, the British 
   government assign bald Chinese-American cop, Lt. Kodyjack (Karl Mak) 
   and female Chinese cop Supt. Hot Tongue (Sylvia Chang), to find the 
   diamonds. They eventually team-up with Sam when Sam's partner hides 
   the diamonds and dies before he can tell him where they are. He does 
   tell Sam that he hid clues to the location on tattoos he placed on 
   the asses of two women (Don't try to make sense of this. Your head 
   will hurt.). Along the way, Kodyjack and Hot Tongue fall in love, Sam 
   falls in love with Hot Tongue's sister Marge (Carroll Gordon) and 
   everyone's lives are threatened, first by a Chinese mobster named Al 
   Capone (he flips out when he spots Sam and Kodyjack taking a picture 
   of his sister's naked ass) and then by White Glove and his minions. 
   The rest of the film is nothing but a series of slapstick adventures, 
   as the trio tries to find the tattooed women and then locate the 
   diamonds. That's basically the entire plot. The film is nothing but 
   one comical gag after another, where Sam and Kodyjack have their 
   lives endangered every ten minutes or so, be it by hanging (a comic 
   highlight where they both have nooses slipped around their necks 
   while tied to opposite ends of a suspended pipe and they take turns 
   in the air hanging by their necks by jumping up and down), by 
   explosives or numerous car chases, while Hot Tongue sits on the 
   sideline, first hating Kodyjack and later swooning whenever he is 
   near (it's quite chauvinistic, actually). Ah, those darn Chinese and 
   their crazy customs!&nbsp; Lightweight in violence, but action-packed 
   from beginning to end, this Hong Kong comedy film (originally known 
   as <B>ACES GO PLACES</B>) was so popular that it spawned four 
   official sequels and numerous imitations. Director Eric Tsang (who 
   also directed the first sequel, <B><A HREF="mad_mission_2_aces_go_places_1983.htm">MAD

    as other films like <B><A HREF="tigers_1991.htm">THE TIGERS</A></B> 
   [1991]) keeps things extremely comical, even if people do die before 
   your eyes (Al Capone and his gang are blown-up in his car by his own 
   bomb in a comical mix-up). It's hard to take any of this seriously, 
   especially when Karl Mak (a co-producer here) dresses like Ming The 
   Merciless from the 1980 version of <B><A HREF="flash_gordon_1980.htm">FLASH
    GORDON</A></B> and dances on stage during a ballet (famed director 
   Tsui Hark portrays the ballet theater director). While the action 
   scenes don't have the &quot;pop&quot; of later Hong Kong films, it's 
   easy to see that this was one of the blueprints for later 80's Hong 
   Kong action cinema (especially Jackie Chan's <B><A HREF="project_a_1&amp;2_1983_1987.htm">PROJECT
    A</A></B> [1983]). Even though this film borrows liberally from many 
   films (the whole &quot;tattoo on the ass&quot; subplot was lifted 
   directly from Antonio Margheriti's <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#StrangerGunfight74">THE
    STRANGER AND THE GUNFIGHTER</A></B> [1974]), it also influenced 
   later films, including the Dirty Harry film, <B><A HREF="dead_pool_1988.htm">THE
    DEAD POOL</A></B> (1988). Watch it and you'll know what I mean. If I 
   do have a problem with this film, it's the English dub track, which 
   tries to be too cutsey-poo with the characters' names and most of the 
   dialogue, especially Karl Mak's conversations with Sylvia Chang. It 
   makes him look and sound like a real chauvinistic pig and hurts his 
   likability factor, especially for female viewers. I'm sure something 
   was lost in the translation, because Hong Kong humor sometimes fails 
   to register with Western audiences. While Samuel Hui was called 
   &quot;King Kong&quot; in the Hong Kong edit, he's inexplicably called 
   &quot;Sam&quot; here and the name &quot;King Kong&quot; is given to a 
   bumbling bearded cop. Mak's character Kodyjack is a play on TV's <B><A HREF="kojak_70s_tv_series.htm">KOJAK</A></B> 
   (he's called Detective Albert Au, or &quot;Baldy&quot; in the Hong 
   Kong version) and Chang's Supt. Hot Tongue was changed from 
   &quot;Supt. Ah Tung&quot;. Unfortunately, although the film looks 
   great in the widescreen version offered on DVD from Anchor Bay 
   Entertainment, only the English-dubbed version is available. This 
   version is also missing about 13 minutes of footage (a few sequences 
   are edited down and whole scenes are missing) that is available on 
   other editions that are subtitled in English. It's still an enjoyable 
   romp, but whoever wrote the English dub track should really suffer 
   from some painful affliction for needlessly subjecting us to some 
   cringe-worthy dialogue. An <A HREF="http://www.anchorbayentertainment.com">Anchor

    BIG RACKET</A></B> - 1976), runs a low-rent private detective agency 
   that is rapidly going broke. A big break comes with a letter in the 
   mail, asking him to find the daughter of a rich Austrian banker, Von

    The letter contains a check for two thousand dollars, so Wally and 
   Vinnie get to work. The photos in the letter contain a naked photo of 
   the daughter, Annalise (Annarita Grapputo; <B><A HREF="double_game_1977.htm">DOUBLE
    GAME</A></B> - 1977), with a man, who Wally identifies as street 
   pimp Strip (Salvatore Billa; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Blood&amp;Diamonds1977">BLOOD
    AND DIAMONDS</A></B> - 1977). Wally meets Strip on the street and 
   has to beat the crap out of him to get him to tell Wally where 
   Annalise is. It seems Annalise quit the prostitution game and joined 
   the Hare Krishnas, so Wally goes to the nearest Krishna chapter and 
   sees Annalise in the background. Unfortunately, career criminal Peg 
   Leg Vincenzo (Umberto Amambrini; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Frankenstein 80">FRANKENSTEIN
    '80</A></B> - 1972) and his boss, Strauss (Werner Pochath; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#TerrorExpress1979">TERROR
    EXPRESS</A></B> - 1979), are also after Annalise (they kill Strip 
   after he tells them where Annalise can be found), so Wally kidnaps 
   her and brings her back to his place. Annalise tries to seduce Wally 
   by stripping in front of him, but Wally isn't biting, so she fakes a 
   medical condition, forcing Wally to run to the drug store for her 
   medication, where Annalise escapes, only to be kidnapped by Peg Leg 
   and Strauss. Wally visits Peg Leg's wife (Luciana Turina; <B><A HREF="riot_in_a_womens_prison_1974.htm">RIOT
    IN A WOMEN'S PRISON</A></B> - 1974), a fat broad who is screwing a 
   skinny man who is not her husband (it's quite funny) and she tells 
   Wally that her husband ran off to Vienna, Austria, so Wally heads 
   there, too, leaving Vinnie to take care of the office in Rome (and 
   beat-off the bill collectors!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    In Vienna, Wally joins forces with private investigator Karl Koper 
   (Gastone Moschin; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#WeekendMurders1970">WEEKEND
    MURDERS</A></B> - 1970), the person who sent Wally the two thousand 
   dollar check on Von Staben's behalf (A running joke throughout the 
   film is Karl being quite proud of his ultra-modern office with all 
   the latest technological advances, but Wally makes him believe he has 
   better technology at his office in Rome. It's a running joke that 
   works quite well in the confines of this film.). When Karl and Wally 
   talk to Von Straben, he tells them to discontinue the search for his 
   daughter, Annalise has returned to the family fold, but it is quite 
   obvious she hasn't and Von Straben is being blackmailed for some 
   reason. As Wally is in Karl's office and about to return to Rome, he 
   meets elderly woman Mrs. Tricazzi (actress unknown), who has been 
   constantly bothering Karl to investigate the death of her 14-year-old 
   daughter Gina (Claudia Messner). She believes her daughter was 
   murdered and didn't die in a traffic accident, so Wally takes her 
   case and stays in Austria, much to the disappointment of Karl, who 
   believes Mrs. Tricazzi is just in mourning and can't accept that Gina 
   died in a simple traffic accident. Wally's investigation leads him to 
   young schoolgirl Renate (Jasmine Maimone; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Demons6-1989">DEMONS
    6: DE PROFUNDIS</A></B> - 1989), who was Gina's best friend, but

   Wally a &quot;moralist.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Wally is then beaten up by three of Strauss' hoods, one of them who 
   is named Kurdt (Giuseppi Marrocco; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Shoot1stDieLate1974">SHOOT
    FIRST, DIE LATER</A></B> - 1974). With Karl's help, Wally is able to 
   find out that Kurdt has a record for sexual assaults on minors and 
   realizes he may be responsible for Gina's murder. This leads Wally to 
   coroner Dr. Zimmer (Franco Ressel; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#ManiacResponsible">THE
    MANIAC RESPONSIBLE</A></B> - 1975), who performed the autopsy on 
   Gina and determined her death was accidental. Wally is sure Dr. 
   Zimmer is covering-up Gina's murder, so he implies to Dr. Zimmer that 
   he is going to have Gina's body exhumed and another autopsy by 
   another doctor being performed on her body, which doesn't sit too 
   well with Zimmer.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Wally also discovers that Strauss is the owner of the Queen Anne, an 
   upscale strip club, so Wally goes there and watches Brigitte (Joan 
   Collins; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#TerrorUnderHouse">TERROR 
   FROM UNDER THE HOUSE</A></B> - 1971) do a slow striptease in front of 
   a rapt audience. Brigitte doesn't take her eyes off Wally, but there 
   are men in the audience watching him, too, one of them telling Wally 
   to never come back to the club again. Wally then picks up Renate in 
   Karl's lime green Porsche and she hits on him, saying girls her age 
   often have sex and some of them even do it for money. When Wally 
   mentions Gina's name, Renate suddenly wants Wally to take her home, 
   saying she'll be late for dinner! Wally won't let up, telling Renate 
   that she knows what happened to Gina, so she better spill the beans. 
   Renate tells Wally to take her home, otherwise she'll yells rape and 
   he will be arrested and sent to jail.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Wally returns to the Queen Anne and asks the busty barmaid if 
   Strauss is looking for him. Brigitte walks up to the bar and begins 
   talking to Wally, telling him she tried to pick him up when they 
   first saw each other, but now it is too late; now it is his turn to 
   pick her up. They go out on a date, which turns out to be a set-up, 
   for as Wally walks Brigitte to her apartment building's front door, 
   two of Strauss' goons sneak up on Wally and give him a beatdown. 
   Wally is taken to a bowling alley (a popular location for Italian 
   [and American] genre films), where Strauss tells Wally to leave 
   Vienna; he has twenty-four hours to do so, otherwise he is dead. 
   Wally then goes to Brigitte's place and slaps the hell out of her for 
   setting him up, but they end up making love. Wally deduces that 
   Gina's murder and Annalise's kidnapping are related, so he and Karl 
   go to Von Straben and discover that he is being blackmailed by 
   Strauss for five million dollars for Annalise's safe return. But what 
   does Strauss have on Von Straben?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Wally then takes Brigitte to a fancy restaurant for dinner, where he 
   gets a phony phone call and then discovers Brigitte talking to Dr. 
   Zimmer. When Wally returns to the table, Brigitte excuses herself to 
   go to the ladies room (she tells Wally she doesn't feel well because 
   they made too much love that day!). When she doesn't return, the 
   maitre d' tells Wally he saw Brigitte leave with Dr. Zimmer. Just 
   what is going on here? When Wally drives back to his hotel room, he 
   discovers Dr. Zimmer's dead body in his bedroom, a bullet in his head 
   in what looks like to be a suicide. When Wally leaves, he discovers 
   his car has two flat tires, apparently sliced with a sharp knife. He 
   runs away fast, realizing that he is being set-up again. He is shot 
   at and chased on foot by a car and after some fancy acrobatics and 
   destroying the car, Wally is chased on foot by Strauss and his head 
   goon (Sergio Mioni; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BloodstainShadow78">THE 
   BLOODSTAINED SHADOW</A></B> - 1978). Wally hides in a subway station 
   phone booth and phones Karl, telling him to get here ASAP and to honk 
   his horn when he arrives. Karl saves Wally's ass and all he wants to 
   do now is go to sleep, but Wally is worried that Strauss will kill 
   Annalise, if he already hasn't done so. Wally still has one lead: 
   Renate, but what can she tell him? Turns out, quite a lot. Renate is 
   a member of an underage prostitution ring, in which Strauss is the 
   boss and Brigitte is the pimp and Madame. Renate tells Wally how 
   Brigitte tempted her with expensive clothes and jewelry, which is how 
   it all began. Gina was also a member, thanks to Renate introducing 
   her to Brigitte, but when Gina refused to become a prostitute, they 
   killed her to keep her from talking to the police, paying Dr. Zimmer 
   to say she died in a car accident.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Von Straben tells Wally and Karl that Strauss wants the five million 
   dollars today and also tells Wally that if Annalise is already dead, 
   to make sure Strauss pays for it with his life. Wally has an idea 
   where Annalise is being held, but can he save her in time? First, he 
   must save Renate from being murdered by Strauss, who found out she 
   talked to Wally. He arrives too late, as one of Strauss' goons 
   viciously hits Renate with a car and leaves her mangled, bloody body 
   at the side of a busy intersection (It's quite shocking in its 
   execution.). Wally demands that Von Straben tells him where he is 
   handing Strauss the money, saying it's his only hope if he wants to 
   see Annalise alive. Wally watches Strauss pick up the money and 
   follows him, leading to the film's bloody conclusion. Wally finds 
   Annalise dead, the victim of an intentional hotshot overdose. 
   Brigitte kills Strauss and takes the money, but Wally catches her and 
   makes her strip (&quot;All the way!&quot;). Wally puts a gun to her 
   face and can't believe someone so beautiful could be responsible for 
   such heinous crimes. Wally is then hit in the back of his head and 
   two shots ring out. When Wally awakens, he finds a completely naked 
   Brigitte dead on the couch, but who fired the shots? Wally finds a 
   hidden camera behind one of the room's paintings, which leads him to 
   a hidden room full of photographic equipment. When he develops the

   Maurizio Merli and Gastone Moschin, whose interplay together makes 
   this film very memorable and sometimes downright funny. Those who 
   only know Merli as a serious actor will be quite surprised here, as 
   he shows a deft hand at comedy, but it's Moschin who really shines in 
   his role as Karl, who is flabbergasted at some of Wally's<A HREF="magnum_cop_1977.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/magnum cop italy poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   dialogue with him, as he tries to one-up him at every opportunity, 
   making Karl feel inferior. The truth is Karl is very good at what he 
   does and supplies Wally with all the vital information he needs to 
   solve the case(s), but Wally never thanks him for a job well done. He 
   keeps making him feel inferior, but Karl keeps chugging along, even 
   saving Wally's life without a single thank-you. The truth is, they 
   make the perfect private detective pair and this film takes full 
   advantage of it. That's not to say that this entire film's a comedy, 
   because it's not. When it needs to be, this film can be very serious, 
   as the deaths are brutal (especially Renate's) and the blood flows 
   freely, but this film finds the perfect balance between these two 
   opposing scenarios and milks it to a tee (Werner Pochath is 
   appropriately slimy as Strauss). As a matter of fact, this would be a 
   perfect companion piece with director Massimo Dallamano's <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WhatDoneSolange1972">WHAT

   of wine on the prostitute's naked breasts and then fucks her doggy 
   style), he gets down to business and inserts an audio tape into a

   shoving two metal pins into his forehead!), Philip pays a visit to

    who has no idea Philip is an assassin (he thinks Philip owns a 
   slaughterhouse on Mainland China). Later that night, a cackling 
   psychopath takes a cop and his girlfriend hostage (where he not only 
   threatens to rape the girlfriend, he pulls down the cop's pants and 
   threatens to buttfuck him!) and Jackie intervenes, shooting the 
   psychopath dead. Jackie's boss is tired of his &quot;shoot first and 
   ask questions later&quot; behavior and warns Jackie that if there are 
   any more deaths on his behalf, he will get kicked off the force (It 
   seems Jackie and Philip are not that different). The film then goes 
   off on a tangent, where two rival crime organizations, one headed by 
   Mr. Chao (some badly-matched new footage is inserted to show that 
   John and Tom are partners with Mr. Chao, who wears a series of 
   ridiculous golf caps whenever he is on-screen, making him look about 
   as threatening as Ralph Malph on <B><A HREF="happy_days_tv_series_1974-1984.htm">HAPPY
    DAYS</A></B> [1974 - 1984]) and the other headed by Simon Chan 
   (Simon Liu), battle each other over drug trade dominance. It turns 
   out that Philip is friends with Simon, making his job of killing John 
   and Tom that much easier. Philip first kills Tom on the beach (in a 
   sequence that must be seen to be believed) and then turns his 
   attention to John (another sequence that will blow your mind), but 
   when brother Jackie is assigned to investigate the string of murders, 
   it becomes obvious that sooner or later they will face-off against 
   each other. Or so you would think. That never happens, though (this 
   is a Godfrey Ho film, after all), as Jackie is killed and Philip vows 
   revenge. When he discovers that Simon and Mr. Chao are actually 
   working together (What?!?), Philip uses all his assassin skills to 
   get even, shooting Mr. Chao in the back with a sniper rifle and 
   finally facing down ex-friend Simon in a haunted house (!), where no 
   one is left standing.&nbsp; This Hong Kong actioner has some truly 
   &quot;What The Fuck?!?&quot; moments, such as when Tom is taking 
   photos of a nude woman on the beach, which then turns absolutely 
   insane. He ends up tying her up spread-eagle on her back using four 
   posts in the sand, begins painting her body and then releases a horde 
   of baby turtles on her naked body, followed by placing a live eel 
   between her spread legs (her vagina tastefully hidden behind a bunch 
   of grapes). Philip comes by in the nick of time and kills Tom (it 
   turns into a hatchet/spade fight and ends when Philip manually 
   impales an arrow in Tom's chest), but instead of freeing the poor 
   girl, Philip just walks over her like she's not there! Another truly 
   WTF moment comes when John, disguised as a woman, tries to kill 
   Philip with an exploding baby stroller (!), only to have Philip pull 
   a boomerang (!!) out of his jacket and slits John's throat with it. 
   There are many more memorable moments, such as when Jackie goes to a 
   gym with a drug-sniffing dog and he makes all the female patrons 
   line-up in a single file while the dog sniffs their crotches. When 
   the dog hits on something, Jackie makes all the women take off their 
   panties and jump up and down, which results in bag-after-bag of 
   heroin to fall out of their snatches! The film's finale also totally 
   rips-off the conclusion of the Charles Bronson film <B><A HREF="mechanic_1972.htm">THE
    MECHANIC</A></B> (1972). The newly-shot footage with John Culkin and 
   John Ladalski is a little less obvious this time, mainly because 
   Philip Ko, who stars in the old footage, appears in the new footage, 
   too (the difference in film stock between the old and new footage is 
   rather apparent, though). As with all Godfrey Ho/Joseph Lai pastiche 
   films, this one is full of stolen music cues and hilarious English 
   dubbing. When Mr. Chao says to one of his contacts, &quot;What kind 
   of schmuck do you think I am?&quot;, I nearly shit my pants 
   (apparently the Chinese are just Jews at heart) and during a 
   nightclub sequence, one of the female dubbers confuses Chao and 
   Chan's names. Another winner in the Ho/Lai canon of

    MAN FROM HONG KONG</A><A NAME="ManFromHongKong"></A> (1975) -</B> 
   This sweeping Hong Kong/Australian co-production is a treat for both 
   the eyes and ears. After federal drug enforcement agent Bob Taylor 
   (Roger Ward) captures drug trafficker Win Chan (a young Sammo Hung) 
   in Australia while he is delivering a shipment of heroin (He says to 
   one of his agents when he asks Taylor if it's heroin: &quot;Well, 
   it's not sherbert!&quot;), Hong Kong supercop/playboy Inspector Fang 
   Sing Leng (Jimmy Wang Yu) is flown in to interrogate the suspect 
   since Win Chan can't speak English. Inspector Leng's interrogation 
   techniques consist of beating the crap out of Win Chan in his cell 
   and then sticking his head in the toilet. Chan tells Leng that the 
   kingpin behind the drug cartel is Jack Wilton (George Lazenby), but 
   when Leng, Taylor and his partner Morrie Grosse (Hugh Keays-Byrne, 
   Toecutter in <B><A HREF="mad_max_1979.htm">MAD MAX</A></B> - 1979) 
   are escorting Chan to the airport, he is shot dead by an assassin 
   (Grant Page). Leng chases the assassin, which leads to a long (and 
   exciting) martial arts fight in a crowded Chinese restaurant (where 
   the assassin splits his pants), resulting in the assassin getting 
   killed. It's apparent that Leng is a cop that doesn't like to play by 
   the rules, which is a good thing, because rich and<A HREF="man_from_hong_kong_1975.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/man from hong kong poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="164" HEIGHT="246" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   influential businessman Jack Wilton (who is also a black belt) will 
   stop at nothing to make sure that Leng ends up dead. After 
   unsuccessfully sending two men to kill Leng in his hotel room (Leng 
   fights them in his pajamas!), Leng calls on Australian reporter 
   Caroline Thorne (Ros Spiers), who he met (and bedded) in Hong Kong 
   when she landed her hang glider on his training grounds (after 
   screwing him, she says to Leng, &quot;You're my first Chinese!), to 
   introduce him to Wilton. She does, at an outdoor party, where Wilton 
   insults Leng (&quot;I never met a Chinese yet that didn't have a 
   yellow streak&quot;) and then challenges him to a martial arts fight 
   in front of all the party guests. After getting a few licks in on 
   Wilton and beating up a bunch of his men, Caroline steps in the 
   middle to break it up, just as Wilton was about to kill Leng with a 
   crossbow. When Leng later takes on Wilton's kung-fu school's entire 
   student body by himself, he is seriously hurt and is rescued by 
   Angelica (Rebecca Gilling), who nurses him back to health and they 
   fall in love. When Angelica is killed when the van they are driving 
   in is blown up by Wilton's men, Leng goes on a killing spree. The 
   finale finds Leng using a hang glider to invade Wilton's penthouse 
   apartment. After a well-staged fight between Leng and Wilton, Leng 
   tapes a grenade in Wilton's mouth, makes him sign a confession and 
   then pulls the pin. As Wilton and his penthouse explode in a 
   fireball, Leng, Taylor and Grosse have a good laugh about how it 
   takes a foreigner to achieve justice on Australian soil.&nbsp; This 
   is an excellent martial arts actioner from Australian director Brian 
   Trenchard-Smith (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#StuntRock">STUNT ROCK</A></B>

   short intervals of Leng screwing women (and some topless nudity), <B><A HREF="man_from_hong_kong_1975b.htm">THE

    OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINE</A></B> (made the same year as this), an 
   international star, but failed. Not for lack of trying, though. Yu is 
   an entertaining screen hero and his fighting skills are impressive, 
   but his (obviously) dubbed voice and deadly serious tone may have 
   been a turn-off for American viewers, who originally saw this in 
   theaters in a slightly-edited version titled <B><A HREF="dragon_flies_1975.htm">THE
    DRAGON FLIES</A></B>. Still, there's a lot to like about this film, 
   from the frequent fights, excellent stunts (including a damn-good car 
   chase in the latter part of the film, where Leng kills everyone 
   involved with Angelica's death) and the beautiful Australian scenery. 
   Ex-James Bond George Lazenby (who a year earlier starred as the title 
   character in the excellent Hong Kong actioner <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Stoner1974">STONER</A></B>),
    is quite good as the villain, spouting racist dialogue (&quot;I find 
   Chinese make the best servants.&quot;) and doing most of his fight 
   scenes without the benefit of a stuntman (even doing a fire stunt, 
   which resulted in Lazenby being hospitalized for severe burns to his 
   hands). I always liked Lazenby as an actor, (his style is loose and 
   natural) and thought he never got the recognition he deserved. This 
   film is a must for all martial arts and action junkies and the Hong 
   Kong DVD, by Fortune Star, is a thing of beauty.&nbsp; Not only do 
   you get a near-flawless uncut widescreen print, but the reworked 5.1 
   Dolby Digital soundtrack is very lively and will have you jumping out 
   of your seat during several scenes, particularly during the car 
   explosion in the beginning of the film and the theme song, &quot;Sky 
   High&quot; by Jigsaw, is an excellent choice considering the subject 
   matter and sounds great here. A required purchase. Trenchard-Smith's

   - 1988-1993), once again using his &quot;Larry Ludman&quot; 
   nom-de-plume. Unlike the <B>THUNDER WARRIOR</B> series (which I 
   happen to like), this film is flat and lifeless, not helped by the 
   fact that John Ethan Wayne is bland and boring, showing none of the 
   charisma of his famous father, The Duke. This is not much of a chase 
   flick, either, as the Stranger is not out to get revenge on anyone, 
   not the Prison Boss, not the Head Guard and, especially, not Bill 
   Robeson (who turns out to be a good guy, helping the Stranger escape 
   and telling him that when he comes back, his horses will be waiting 
   for him!). The Stranger just wants to find the man who sold him the 
   horses, so he can get a receipt to prove the horses are his! (Which 
   he does, in a finale that defies all common sense, but I'll leave 
   that for you to discover). The screenplay, by De Angelis and Dardano 
   Sacchetti (as &quot;David Parker Jr.&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Psychic1977">THE
    PSYCHIC</A></B> - 1977; <B><A HREF="#Blastfighter1984">BLASTFIGHTER</A></B> 
   - 1984; and De Angelis' <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#KillerCrocodile">KILLER
    CROCODILE</A></B> - 1989), if you want to call it that, is basically 
   one man's love for his two new horses, who is willing to serve three 
   years hard time to prove that the horses are his. It doesn't help 
   that the Stranger is a one-dimensional character, without a lick of 
   personality, so it's hard to believe that he would put himself 
   through all this just for two horses. It doesn't look like he is 
   capable of loving anything, nevermind two animals. And that is where 
   this film fails. We feel nothing for the Stranger, not even pity, 
   because he puts himself through hell and does stupid things to get 
   his horses back. Also, Borgnine's character changing from bad guy to 
   good guy also defies expectations and not in a good way. It hard to 
   believe he has compassion for the Stranger, especially the way he 
   treated him in the beginning of the film. All in all, this film fails 
   on so many levels, it's hard to recommend it to anyone but those who 
   have to see every Italian chase drama out there. I'm a fan of that 
   genre, but this film just doesn't cut it. It's slow, lazy and the 
   characters are stereotypes.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   (1972) -</B> The New York Mob sends two American hitmen, Dave 
   Cantania (Henry Silva) and Frank Webster (Woody Strode), to Italy to 
   kill Luca Canali (Mario Adorf), who they believe took part in a theft 
   of a six million dollar shipment of their heroin. The Mob <A HREF="manhunt_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/manhunt 1972 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>wants
    Luca's death to be flashy as possible, a warning to all those who 
   would even think about ripping them off in the future. The only 
   problem is, Luca (who is a beefy, but goodhearted, pimp) is innocent. 
   Dave and Frank make their way to Milan, where they are met by the 
   beautiful Eva Lalli (Luciana Paluzzi), who is assigned to show them a 
   good time and get their faces shown around town. Dave and Frank's 
   first stop is local Mafia kingpin Don Vito Tressoldi (Adolfo Celi), 
   who agrees to deliver Luca to them alive, but privately is very 
   suspicious of the two American's sudden presence. It's also apparent 
   that the two hitmen have distinct (and opposite) personalities. Frank 
   is all business and would rather just get the job done, while Dave is 
   a womanizer (he likes his hookers!) and a partier, which soons gets 
   him in trouble with some prostitutes and scooter-riding toughs in a 
   park one night (Frank reluctantly steps in and saves his ass). Two of 
   Don Vito's men pick up Luca and try to rough him up in a sawmill 
   (Luca says, &quot;Smells good. What's it's for, making 
   coffins?&quot;), but Luca beats the snot out of them before Don Vito 
   arrives. Luca then calls Dave and Frank and tells them to come to the 
   sawmill, to embarass Do Vito (Dave shoots Don Vito's two men in the 
   kneecaps to prove he means business. Don Vito then kills them to 
   prove he means business, too!). Luca is now one of the most wanted 
   men in Milan (even his live-in whore leaves him when one of Don 
   Vito's men gives her a titty-twister!), so he goes to friend Enrico 
   (Franco Fabrizi) for a gun and is forced to kill two of Don Vito's 
   men when they try to bring him in. Don Vito threatens the life of 
   Luca's ex-wife Lucia (Sylvia Koscina) and young daughter Rita and 
   when Luca goes to take them to safety, he helplessly watches as a van 
   driven by one of Don Vito's men runs them over and kills them (in the 
   film's most shocking scene). The hunted becomes the hunter and, after 
   he kills the van driver, Luca sets his sights on Don Vito. After 
   getting well-deserved justice, Luca must still contend with Dave and 
   Frank. He decides to do so on his terms in an auto junkyard, where a 
   giant claw on a crane comes into play.&nbsp; This early 70's

    performance as Luca, some excellent action set-pieces and a brassy 
   music score. My favorite sequence comes when Luca witnesses his 
   ex-wife and daughter's deaths. He chases down the van driver, first 
   by stealing a car and then in a foot chase in his quest to get 
   retribution. When he jumps on the speeding van and headbutts the 
   windshield until he breaks through the glass to get his hands on the 
   driver (where he eventually stabs the driver in the throat), you know 
   he really means business. What's truly remarkable about Adorf's 
   performance, though, is that he goes through nearly the entire film 
   not knowing why he is a wanted man. When he finally finds out as he 
   corners Don Vito (after killing all his men), you can see in his eyes 
   that he has passed the point of no return. Knowing that the American 
   hitmen will not give up until their contract is completed, Luca kills 
   Don Vito (another very good scene) and sets up a meeting with Dave 
   and Frank in a junkyard, in the film's uncompromising finale (there's 
   a scene with a kitten that will break your heart). Both Henry Silva (<B><A HREF="action.htm#Almost Human">ALMOST

    I was so upset that I never gave this film (nor <A HREF="film_ventures_international_film_releases.htm">Film
    Ventures International</A>, the distributor) the chance to stand on 
   its&#146; own merits. I still haven&#146;t forgiven Film Ventures, 
   but I decided to view this film again on its&#146; own merits. I am 
   now a much smarter consumer and should have no one to blame but 
   myself. This is an extremely violent actioner that is severely 
   compromised by the presence of Chris Mitchum. His non-acting style 
   (trying to emulate his father with no success) brings this film down 
   several notches, marring an otherwise bloody good time. Mitchum stars 
   as Rico Aversi, a recently paroled con who returns to his hometown to 
   seek revenge for the brutal murder of his mobster father (seen 
   getting his brains blown out in gory close-up at the beginning of the 
   film). The object of Rico&#146;s revenge is Don Vito (an excellent 
   Arthur Kennedy, who never achieved the recognition he deserved), a 
   local mobster who took over Rico&#146;s family business. Don Vito has 
   a very nasty way of disposing of his enemies: He has them thrown into 
   a vat of caustic acid that he has in his soap factory. He then turns 
   them into bars of soap that he uses for his drug running operation 
   (heroin hidden inside the bars). Rico begins to make life miserable 
   for Don Vito. He breaks into Vito&#146;s house and makes contact with 
   his old girlfriend Rosa (the terminally naked Melisa Longo), who is 
   now Don Vito&#146;s mistress. She agrees to help Rico bring Vito 
   down. Rico then steals a shipment of Vito&#146;s diamonds and 
   disrupts his drug running business. A very pissed-off Don Vito begins 
   to clean house. When he catches Rosa making love with one of his 
   thugs, he castrates the thug and throws him and Rosa into the vat. He 
   also sends his henchmen out to brutally gun down Rico&#146;s sister 
   and brother-in-law (in bed making love) as well as his 
   wheelchair-ridden mother. It all ends in a bloody shoot-out in an 
   abandoned junkyard where there are no happy endings. Chris Mitchum 
   leaves a lot to be desired as an actor (He really didn't hit his 
   stride until the string of films he did in the Philippines and 
   Indonesia, such as <B><A HREF="#AmericanCommandos">AMERICAN COMMANDOS</A></B> [1984]</FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="cauldron_of_death_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cauldron of death.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="270" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"> 
   and <B><A HREF="#Final Score">FINAL SCORE</A></B> [1986]). The script 
   calls for an anti-hero that can show emotion and he does not fit the 
   bill. When his family is brutally murdered at the end of the film, he 
   merely acts morose as if he does not care. It ruins the effect of the 
   revenge plot. Mitchum&#146;s presence aside, this film still has a 
   lot to offer exploitation fans. It has wall-to-wall nudity (supplied 
   by the aforementioned Longo and Barbara Bouchet as Rico&#146;s new 
   girlfriend), plenty of gunplay and some nasty bits of gore. One such 
   scene is the castration I mentioned earlier. While you do not see the 
   actual castration (a Venezuelan bootleg edition purportedly shows the 
   entire act!), if you freeze frame just before he is thrown into the 
   vat you can see the gory aftermath. It is not a pretty sight. Film

   himself up, but Massimo has taken the store owner hostage and demands 
   a car to escape, offering the owner in exchange. The police overpower 
   Massimo and the Commissioner pulls off his ski mask. The next time we 
   see Massimo, he is entering his prison cell for the very first time. 
   When prisioner Manolo (Emilio Messina; <B><A HREF="seven_magnificent_gladiators_1983.htm">THE
    SEVEN MAGNIFICENT GLADIATORS</A></B> - 1983), who knows everything 
   about Massimo, tells him not to sleep on the empty bunk above him, 
   saying he gets on his nerves and calling Massimo a 
   &quot;chickenshit&quot;, Massimo gets up and takes the top bunk over 
   another prisoner, Piero (Heinz Domez). The next morning, Piero tells 
   Massimo that his boss, underworld figure Giulianelli (Martin Balsam; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Blood&amp;Diamonds1977">BLOOD
    AND DIAMONDS</A></B> - 1977), wants to meet him in the yard. Manolo 
   keeps calling Massimo names (like &quot;sissy&quot;), so he throws a 
   glass of wine&nbsp; (sent by Giulianelli) in Manolo's face. Massimo 
   then meets Giulianelli in the yard and it's quite obvious that he 
   gets special treatment in prison, as he's a jailed Mafia Don who 
   still wears three-piece suits in prison. Giulianelli takes one look 
   at Massimo and he says to Piero, &quot;Let's see what he's made 
   of&quot; and then walks away. When time is up in the yard, everyone 
   goes back to their cells. Everyone but Massimo, that is. He has to go 
   mano-a-mano with Manolo in the yard, who is pissed about the wine in 
   the face and is out to kill Massimo, with Giulianelli watching the 
   action from a window, smiling and drinking a cup of cappuccino. 
   Manolo calls Massimo a &quot;pussy&quot; and the fight is on, both of 
   them doing damage to each other, but Massimo gets the upper hand&nbsp;
    and seriously hurts Manolo. Massimo looks up at Giulianelli and gets 
   a smile and a nod, Giulianelli saying to his personal valet, &quot;I 
   don't think Manolo's gonna be getting out of the infirmary that soon.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Massimo then gets a visit from Commissioner Sacchi and we discover 
   that Massimo is an undercover cop sent to prison to get the goods on 
   Giulianelli and his drug trade syndicate. A flashback shows us street 
   cop Massimo sitting in a park with his mother when two bank robbers 
   run into the park, one holding a shotgun and the other holding a bag 
   of money. Massimo goes to pull his gun out of his holster, but his 
   mother stops him, only for Mom to get shotgunned in the back, putting 
   her in a wheelchair for life. Massimo has a reason for going after 
   Giulianelli, as the two bank robbers were on his payroll. Massimo 
   tells the Commissioner that money gets things done in prison faster 
   when the Commissioner asks Massimo if he has heard of any escape 
   plans by Giulianelli.&nbsp; The Commissioner tells Massimo that he 
   will have Giulianelli transferred to his cell since Piero is a member 
   of his gang and no one will be suspicious about it. This way, if 
   Giulianelli plans an escape, they will have to take Massimo with 
   them. As the Commissioner leaves, he says, &quot;Massimo, try not to 
   bash your head on the wall&quot; (It's obvious that the Commissioner 
   thinks Massimo is too young and hotheaded for this assignment [he may 
   be right] and you can see on his face he cares about Massimo a lot).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    With the help of a crooked guard, Massimo, Piero and Giulianelli 
   escape from prison, but when they split up to go their separate ways, 
   a car full of hoods working for Giulianelli's biggest rival, Spittle 
   (co-screenwriter Peter Berling; <A HREF="#Manhunt1972"><B>MANHUNT</B></A> 
   - 1972), drive by and open fire, hitting Giulianelli in the shoulder. 
   Massimo saves his life by crashing his car intro theirs, shooting and 
   killing all the hoods. From this moment on, Massimo is Giulianelli's 
   most trusted friend (Piero wants to kill Massimo, but Giulianelli 
   says no, telling Piero, &quot;We owe him and we need new 
   people&quot;). Massimo and Piero kidnap a pusher who use to work for 
   Giulianelli, but he now works for Spittle. This pusher's traitorous 
   act is what sent Giulianelli to prison. This kidnapping leads to a 
   car chase (and a damned good one!), as Massimo kills the driver and 
   the shooter with his pistol, causing their car to flip and crash. 
   Back at the hideout, Giulianelli starts kicking the pusher around and 
   the pusher tells him he knows where and when Spittles's next drug 
   shipment is going to be delivered. He also tells Giulianelli that 
   Spittle will be there personally to pick it up (&quot;Spittle likes 
   to handle things in person. He wouldn't trust his own mother.&quot;). 
   The drugs are on a train due today from Holland. They are going to 
   make it look like repairs are needed on one of the freight cars, so 
   it has to go to the train depot. In some place on that freight car is 
   the drug shipment and Spittle will pick it up tomorrow afternoon. The 
   pusher begs for his life, but Giulianelli looks at him and says, 
   &quot;This shit is still a shit&quot; and tells Piero to shoot him, 
   which he does, twice, point-blank in the head. We then see Massimo 
   and Piero at the train depot, watching Spittle get the drugs. When he 
   does, Massimo and Piero shoot and kill Spittle and his goons. When 
   one of the goons is still alive, Piero tells Massimo to kill him, 
   which he does without much hesitation. As they are walking out of the 
   depot, a security guard who knows Massimo nearly blows his cover by 
   calling out his name, forcing Massimo to punch his lights out. When 
   Piero asks him how the security guard knew him, Massimo is quick on

    Giulianelli then has a meeting with the other drug bosses and tells 
   them now that Spittle is dead, everyone can have their own district 
   without fear of reprisal. The bosses are happy to hear this and vow 
   there will be no back-stabbing or double-crosses ever again. 
   Giulianelli assures them there's nothing more to fear from the 
   competition. When the district bosses leave, Giulianelli, Piero and 
   Massimo sit at a table (where a <A HREF="j&amp;b_scotch_whiskey_in_italian_films.htm">bottle
    of J&amp;B Scotch</A> sits, its distinctive label&nbsp; dead center 
   in the frame) and Piero tells his boss that Massimo is just the man 
   he wants and needs in his syndicate. Giulianelli hands them both fake 
   passports, telling them the cops are going to make it very hot for 
   them here, so they better get away for a while until things cool 
   down. Massimo almost blows his cover when Giulianelli mentions going 
   to the Riviera and he also mentions Genoa. Massimo says before he 
   goes, he has something personal to take care of, not telling 
   Giulianelli or Piero what it is. Piero wants to go with him, but 
   Massimo says no, it's something very personal. Massimo then meets the 
   Commissioner in the nosebleed seats of a soccer game, the 
   Commissioner wanting to know why he is killing people left and right. 
   Massimo says he does it to maintain his cover and Giulianelli now 
   considers him one of the boys. The Commissioner is worried, and 
   rightfully so, that Massimo is digging himself into a deep hole he 
   may not be able to escape from, but Massimo tells him the people he 
   killed were necessary&nbsp; to keep his cover intact<A HREF="meet_him_and_die_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("189","305") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/meet him and die british vhs front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="189" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   (this would never even be considered acceptable in the U.S.). &quot;A 
   man-eating tiger, that's what you've become&quot;, says the 
   Commissioner and Massimo replies, &quot;And what did you think this 
   operation could be, a Boy Scout venture?&quot; Massimo tells him that 
   Giulianelli is just a pawn, there are bigger bosses to capture. He 
   tells the Commissioner that Giulianelli is taking him to Genoa 
   tomorrow and the Commissioner asks Massimo if he thinks he can nail 
   them on his own without any help or is he overestimating himself 
   because they will nail him. &quot;It's revenge you want, Isn't 
   it?&quot;, says the Commissioner and Massimo replies that he's tired 
   of seeing his colleagues murdered in the name of the law. He in a 
   position to get even, even if it's considered a drop in the bucket. 
   The Commissioner says he will cover his ass, but Massimo gets up, 
   walks away and says he doesn't need his help. Has Massimo gone beyond 
   the point of no return? (As Massimo walks away, we see the soccer 
   game get out of control, as spectators storm the field over a bad 
   call, the police using water canons on them. It is an apt parable to 
   Massimo's situation.).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When Massimo gets back to the hideout, Giulianelli asks him to get a 
   car because he needs to see someone before they go to Genoa. Under 
   the pretense of needing to taking a leak, Massimo leaves Piero in the 
   car and spies on Giulianelli talking to two bigger bosses, Mr. Marti 
   (Philip Dallas; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#WarriorLostWorld83">WARRIOR
    OF THE LOST WORLD</A></B> - 1983) and Mr. Perrone (Ettore Manni; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#SilverSaddle1978">SILVER
    SADDLE</A></B> - 1978). Massimo hears his boss say that he is 
   sending him on an important task, but not to worry because he trusts 
   Massimo like a son. Then Massimo sees the bank robber that shotgunned 
   hos mother in the back enter the room. Piero wonders what is taking 
   Massimo so long and gets out of the car to find him, but Massimo is 
   one step ahead of him (He pays a hooker on the street to make it look 
   like she just got done giving him oral sex! She tells another hooker, 
   &quot;He gave me double my fee. What a windfall!&quot;).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Massimo doesn't know it, but the Commissioner is also in Genoa under 
   the alias &quot;Dr. Sacchi&quot;, so he can keep an eye on him. At 
   the hotel's pool in Genoa, Masimo and Piero meet Mr. Perrone, who 
   looks at Massimo and says, &quot;You're just a kid!&quot; &quot;He 
   looks big enough to me&quot;, says Perrone's nameless pretty 
   secretary (Elke Sommer; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Lisa&amp;TheDevil1973">LISA
    AND THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1973), who is in a revealing bikini. Massimo 
   and Piero are to pick up a shipment of drugs for Mr. Perrone and he 
   tells Massimo to be careful because the drugs are hidden in a 
   shipment of eggs and it's worth millions to some &quot;very important 
   people.&quot; As Massimo walks away, the nameless secretary 
   tells&nbsp; him she hopes to&nbsp; to meet him again, which perturbs 
   Perrone. &quot;Dr. Sacchi&quot; has lost sight of Massimo, so he 
   goes&nbsp; to the Police Captain (Consalvo Dell'Arti; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#KnifeOfIce1972">KNIFE
    OF ICE</A></B> - 1972) in Genoa to help him look for Massimo. 
   Massimo phones Perrone's secretary and asks for a date, but she says 
   no, telling him, &quot;My boss doesn't like to share his secretary 
   with employees. Sorry, but that's the way it is&quot; and hangs up 
   the phone with a smile on her face. When Piero goes to Monte Carlo to 
   transfer the drugs from a train to a truck, Massimo goes to his hotel 
   room and finds the secretary waiting for him and they do the mattress 
   mambo (Elke Sommer is a very beautiful woman in and out of clothes). 
   When they are done, she catches Massimo going through her purse, 
   finding a pistol, but he is more interested in her passport so he can 
   get her name (which is never revealed). When Piero picks up Massimo 
   and drives him to the drug shipment, they notice they are being 
   followed by a car. Piero pulls over to the side of the road and stops 
   the other car. He shoots the driver, who is an undercover cop, in the 
   head, but not before he yells out Massimo's real last name a couple 
   of times. Piero turns around, ready to shoot Massimo, but Masssimo 
   already has his pistol drawn and empties it into Piero's body, the 
   first bullet a direct hit to the heart. Massimo then drives to the 
   truck containing the drugs and drives off. Is he going to make the 
   scheduled delivery to Perrone or dioes he have other plans? (He has a 
   very close call at the border checkpoint)? When he comes across a 
   body blocking his way in the middle of the road, he falls for the 
   oldest trick in the book: a truck hijack. When the truck is stolen. 
   Massimo steals one of the thieve's motorcycles and the chase is on 
   (there's a terrifying stunt in the middle of the chase where it looks 
   like Lovelock's stuntman took a very nasty fall and hurt himself 
   badly). Massimo regains custody of the truck and delivers the drugs 
   to Mr. Perrone, telling him that the truck was hijacked, but he 
   handled it. Perrone pulls out his gun and goes to shoot Massimo but, 
   before he can pull the trigger, his secretary shoots him in the back, 
   killing him. It seems she knows Massimo is a cop and she even knows 
   the hotel the Commissioner is staying in. How? I'll leave that for 
   you to discover, but if you think she is also an undercover cop, you 
   would be wrong. So, does Massimo get the revenge he is looking for? 
   I'll also leave that for you to discover, but I'll tell you this: 
   When the whoile undercover operation turns out to be a bust, Massimo 
   decides to get some payback at Mr. Marti's house, but he's too late, 
   as someone has shot Mr. Marti in the head and the two bank robbers 
   are also dead. He hears a car pulling out of the driveway, pulls out 
   his pistol and points it at...</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This very entertaining EuroCrime film was directed by Francesco

    KING OF THE BARBARIANS</A></B> (1982) and <B><A HREF="throne_of_fire_1983.htm">THE
    THRONE OF FIRE</A></B> (1983). I should footnote this by saying 
   Francesco Prosperi was not related to Franco E. Prosperi, who gave us 
   such films as <B><A HREF="mondo_cane_1962.htm">MONDO CANE</A></B>

   (1983), even though they are constantly credited as the same person 
   on many reference sites and books. This film contains what I believe 
   to be Ray Lovelock's best performance (he even sings the <A HREF="meet_him_and_die_1976.htm#LovelockOST">opening
    and closing tunes</A>), even better than his role in <B><A HREF="#LiveLikeA Cop">LIVE
    LIKE A COP, DIE LIKE A MAN</A> </B>(1976), which was made just 
   before this one. His Massimo Torlani is a troubled soul, watching his 
   mother get shot when the shotgun blast was meant for him and he is 
   more than willing to break every law, even killing people in cold 
   blood, to satisfy his thirst for revenge. That's what makes the 
   ending of this film so satisfying. Massimo gets no satisfaction at 
   all, as no one finds drugs on Giulianelli and he can't even be 
   charged&nbsp; with breaking out of jail since the jailbreak was an 
   undercover operation. The worst the law can do is send Giulianelli 
   back to prison to serve out his original term, Massimo knowing first 
   hand&nbsp; that he will be treated like a king in prison. Massimo 
   can't even get the satisfaction of killing the bank robbers who put 
   his mother in a wheelchair, as someone else beat him to it. The final 
   shot in the film leaves you wondering if Masssimo will shoot the 
   person who killed them, which is why I love EuroCrime films so much, 
   as there are no easy answers. Hell, Massimo can't even take down 
   Giulianelli's bosses, as they are also killed by someone else. <A HREF="meet_him_and_die_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("229","305") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/meet him and die italy dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="229" HEIGHT="307" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Fans
    of EuroCrime films will find much to enjoy here, from Prosperi's 
   taut direction, wonderful performances (Riccardo Cucciolla is equally 
   good as Commissioner Sacchi, whom we can see really cares about 
   Massimo and hates what being undercover does to him), a couple of 
   well-filmed&nbsp; and exciting car chases and even some topless 
   nudity from Elke Sommer, who never looked as beautiful as she does 
   here. And let's not forget about Martin Balsam, who always 
   delivers&nbsp; a magnificent performance, be it in <B><A HREF="confessions_of_a_police_captain_1971.htm">CONFESSIONS

   (1979) or this film. He shines when he portrays people of 
   questionable character, as you never know if he is going to kiss you 
   or shoot you in the face. Speaking of face-shooting, this film 
   doesn't have a lot of bloody violence, but when it happens, it is 
   quite shocking, be it Massimo's mother's shotgunning, Piero shooting 
   the undercover cop in the head (the bullet exits out the back of his 
   head in an explosion of blood and brain matter) or Massimo shooting 
   Piero when his cover is blown. The best EuroCrime films know when 
   extreme violence is necessary to push the story forward and this film 
   is a prime example of that technique (Screenplay by co-star Peter

   a bunch of other female captives. When Erica doesn't hear from her 
   sister for three days, she flies to San Francisco and hires private 
   investigator Mike Penny (Steve Viall) to find Vanessa when the police 
   refuse to help. After some pretty quick (and utterly convenient) 
   detective work, Mike and Erica end up at Doug's warehouse, where 
   Erica finds one of Vanessa's earrings before her and Mike's cover are 
   blown and they are forced to flee. Doug, his equally evil wife Sue 
   (Susan Mannion) and even more evil assistant Frank (George A. Bryant) 
   know it's only a matter of time before the police raid the warehouse, 
   so they drug Vanessa and the other captive girls, place them in 
   wooden crates and drive them to the airport, where Victor is arriving 
   to pick them up in his personal jet. Mike and Erica follow them to 
   the airport, where Vanessa escapes from her crate, but is shot in the 
   neck by Sue when she tries to escape with sister Erica and Mike. 
   Victor escapes in his jet (without his new supply of girls), while 
   Doug, Sue and Frank are chased by the cops. Frank is killed in a 
   shootout and Sue is captured, but Doug escapes by stealing a plane 
   and having Victor pick him up at the next airport. Vanessa is rushed 
   to the hospital and survives her wounds, while Victor and Frank fly 
   back to Hong Kong, only to learn that rival Chan (Steve Sasaki) has 
   taken over Victor's strip club. While Victor plots his revenge 
   against Chan, Doug travels back to San Francisco, puts on a disguise 
   and rescues Sue during her trial (He kills the judge and all of the 
   court officers in a hail of gunfire), with Mike and Erica in 
   attendance. Erica ends up shooting Sue in the back in the court's 
   parking lot, killing her, with Doug vowing revenge. The finale finds 
   Doug trying to exact that revenge (and failing miserably), while the 
   explosives-loving Victor (who, throughout the film, shows his 
   proclivity for blowing up things buy remote control) gets his 
   comeuppance at the hands of Chan.&nbsp; This mediocre actioner, 
   directed/produced by Scott Pfeiffer (<B><A HREF="fire_fight_1988.htm">FIRE
    FIGHT</A></B> - 1988) and written by Pfeiffer and Marie Ann 
   Whitaker, isn't helped by the fact that the usually dependable Big 
   Bill Smith looks bored throughout (At one point he's sound asleep 
   while the sound of gunfire is heard on the soundtrack!) and mumbles 
   most of his lines until much of his dialogue is unintelligible (The 
   live sound recording doesn't help, either, as the further the actors 
   are away from the microphones, the harder it is to hear what they are 
   saying, thanks to background noise and no post-production looping). 
   The violence is also tame considering the subject matter (the 
   bloodiest it gets is when Erica shoots Sue in the back in the film's 
   slow-motion Peckinpah rip-off) and there's not much nudity as you 
   would expect (there is some naked flesh on view, but even Victor's 
   strippers are fully clothed!). Factor in that most of the acting is 
   below average (only James Pfeiffer, director Scott's brother, makes 
   an impression as the relentless Doug) and the characters merely 
   cardboard cut-outs (not to mention that Mike is one of the most inept 
   and luckiest private dicks I have ever seen), which makes <B>MERCHANT 
   OF EVIL</B> a less-than B-grade action film (even the car chases seem 
   like they were filmed in slow motion) that can only be recommended 
   for those rabid William Smith fans that must see every film he has 
   appeared in. You know who you are (Yeah, I'm one of them!). Also

    KILLFAST</A><A NAME="MissionKillfast"></A> (1982/1991) -</B> Here's 
   a little-seen actioner from director/producer/co-scripter Ted V. 
   Mikels that was started in 1982, but wasn't completed until 1991 due 
   to financial problems (and it shows). Someone steals two nuclear 
   detonators from a U.S. military base, so the government pulls ex-CIA 
   operative Tiger Yang (played appropriately by...Tiger Yang) out of 
   mothballs to retrieve them (he now runs a chain of successful martial 
   arts schools). The bad guys catch wind that Tiger is on their trail, 
   so they decide to strike first and assassinate him like President 
   Kennedy as he rides in a convertible while acting as Grand Marshall 
   of one of the most anemic parades in film history (a mixture of stock 
   parade footage combined with new footage of Tiger sitting in a car 
   with a cheap-ass handwritten &quot;Tiger Yang Grand Marshall&quot; 
   sign attached to the door). Before you can say &quot;second shooter 
   in the grassy knoll&quot;, Tiger's CIA associates stop the 
   assassination attempt, but pay for it with their lives. Meanwhile, a 
   ruthless businessman named Murak (Sonny King) plans on using the 
   stolen detonators to create<A HREF="mission_killfast_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mission killfast poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   his own nuclear bombs, so Tiger and several of his black belt 
   students intercept the shipment and a fight breaks out (using some of 
   the most exaggerated sound effects you will ever hear this side of a 
   dubbed 70's Hong Kong kung fu flick). Murak feels that there is a 
   snitch in his midst (and rightfully so) and, thinking that model 
   Chantelle (played by Shanti, a.k.a. Wendy O. Altamura) is the 
   perpetrator, has her shot in the head while she's modeling a bikini 
   in a desert photo shoot. Tiger's next assignment is to destroy the 
   base of a paramilitary terrorist group that is building up a supply 
   of powerful weapons (What does this have to do with the rest of the 
   film? I don't know, but I'm sure it has something to do with the 
   troubled production history.). Tiger joins forces with Catt (Sharon 
   Hughes), whose father was murdered by the bad guys, to stop the 
   terrorist group. This somehow involves Catt going undercover as a 
   model at an agency run by Shannon (Kyle E. Cranston). Catt is raped 
   by a crooked cop (who has more hair on his body than an ape), but 
   comes up with valuable information which could break the case (Which 
   case is it now? I'm confused!). When someone stabs Catt to death with 
   a hunting knife, Tiger shifts into shogun mode to get revenge on all 
   the bad guys.&nbsp; The first thing you'll notice about this flick is 
   the piecemeal feel and look of the entire production. It jumps from 
   one scene to the next without any connective tissue, like it's coming 
   directly from the fragmented mind of an institutionalized 
   schizophrenic. This only adds to the film's charms, because it 
   eventually becomes a game for viewers, as you try to spot the footage 
   shot in 1982 and the footage shot nearly a decade later. It's not 
   that hard to do because the film stock is noticeably different 
   between the two time frames, as are the fashions on view. It's 
   obvious that Mikels was trying to make Tiger Yang (who sports a 
   Charles Bronson-like moustache that changes in thickness from 
   scene-to-scene) his own personal Bruce Lee, but Tiger has the 
   charisma and English language skills of a tree branch and Mikels has 
   no idea how to frame a martial arts fight. This film also contains a 
   lot of Mikels' signature traits, including overuse of stock footage; 
   stock sound effects (whenever a moving car is shown, we hear the 
   sound of squealing tires, even if they are traveling in a straight 
   line or on a dirt road); threadbare sets; MOS sound (one scene shows 
   two guys talking by a lake filled with quacking ducks and it becomes

   footage shot in 1982. No bones about it, this is a terrible film that 
   makes no sense at all (people appear and then disappear, never to be 
   heard from again, as their story lines are simply dropped in hopes we 
   don't notice), but it's the film's innate terribleness that makes it 
   so watchable. Be prepared, though, because this is a loooong 97 
   minutes. Originally titled <B><A HREF="omega_assassins_1982.htm">OMEGA

    IN ACTION</A><A NAME="MovieInAction"></A> (1987) -</B> When it came 
   to Filipino action films, it was hard to beat the teaming of late 
   director Teddy Page (here using the name &quot;Ted Johnson&quot;) and 
   (usually) uncredited producer K.Y. Lim and his Silver Star Film 
   Company production outfit. <B>MOVIE IN ACTION</B> opens with a heated 
   battle between guys in military gear and Asian bad guys in Thailand, 
   only to be revealed to be nothing but a low-budget film shoot a few 
   minutes later. As they set up their next camera shot, we get to meet 
   the film crew, which includes Frank (Bo Svenson; <B><A HREF="#DeadlyImpact">DEADLY
    IMPACT</A></B> - 1984), the director; Billy (Mike Monty; <B><A HREF="#JustADamnedSoldier">JUST
    A DAMNED SOLDIER</A></B> - 1988), the producer; Brian (Jim Gaines; <B><A HREF="#JungleRats">JUNGLE

    WITHOUT END</A></B> - 1986), the special effects technician; Mike 
   (Don Holden), the lead actor; and Susan (Chantal Mansfield), the 
   prima-donna lead actress. As they roll for their next scene, things 
   take a turn for the worse when a group of real-life rebels kidnap 
   Susan and shoot-up the film set with real bullets, hitting Frank in 
   the leg. The movie is immediately shut down and Frank and Billy go to 
   the American Embassy for<A HREF="movie_in_action_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/movie in action dutch vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="171" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   help. When the Embassy and the Thai government offer little help in 
   rescuing Susan, Frank and his team of filmmakers spring into action 
   to rescue Susan on their own. Since Susan was wearing a wireless body 
   microphone when she was kidnapped, the crew is able to track her 
   location after stealing a signal-enhancing device from a military 
   outpost (using one of Robert's remote control cars as a decoy to 
   distract the guards). While Frank is unable to go with them because 
   of his injured leg and Billy mysteriously giving them only 72 hours 
   before he pulls the plug, the rest of the ragtag gang (they call 
   themselves &quot;Movie Warriors&quot;) illegally enter Cambodia and 
   each uses their separate talents to get closer to their goal of 
   rescuing Susan. Attention-whore Billy (ever know a producer who isn't 
   one?) may blow the whole enterprise when he holds daily press 
   conferences to report on the Movie Warriors' progress. After many 
   close calls, the Movie Warriors reach their objective and save Susan, 
   only to discover Billy is the brains behind the kidnapping as a way 
   to collect insurance money on a film he didn't want completed. Just 
   when things look dire for the Movie Warriors, Franks shows up and 
   saves the day. Luckily, Keith recorded everything on-camera and the 
   film turns into a giant hit. Next up: Maybe a film in Afghanistan as 
   a favor to President Reagan!&nbsp; Though light as a feather when it 
   comes to common sense (You mean to tell me that not one of the bad 
   guys bothered to frisk Susan? And how long does the battery on a body 
   mike last anyway?), <B>MOVIE IN ACTION</B> (also known as <B><A HREF="wartime_aka_movie_in_action_1987.htm">WARTIME</A></B>)
    delivers the goods when it comes to violence and pyrotechnics. Lots 
   of objects explode (including a booby-trapped dummy Robert rigs to 
   explode when a bad guy kicks it) and gunfights ensue as the film 
   progresses, as each member of the team puts their film knowledge to 
   real-life use (Combat trained Mike and special effects tech Robert 
   get the biggest workouts here). It's hilarious watching the usually 
   tough Jim Gaines play such a timid, gay character here, as Brian is 
   such a scaredy cat, he is literally ordered by Mike (who channels his 
   film's macho character) to join the team (Brian does have a redeeming 
   moment in the finale, though). There are some inventive gags (Lee 
   covering everyone in stage blood to make them look dead to the enemy; 
   turning a Jeep into an ox-driven hay cart; the team sporting rubber 
   horror masks to scare a local villager so they can steal his buffalo 
   cart), but this is mostly a humorous (if violent) tale about people 
   banding together for the common good. Nobody really likes Susan, but 
   as Frank says in the beginning of the film, &quot;We all came here 
   together and we'll all leave together!&quot; Not such a bad 
   philosophy to have, is it? Director Teddy Page (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Blood Debts">BLOOD

   major characters survive (even Billy, who gets a proper comeuppance 
   in the finale) and the deaths only come at the expense of the 
   faceless hordes of bad guys and one jerk (played by Anthony Young) 
   who clearly has the hots for Susan. Not as frantic as Page's full-on 
   action flicks, but a pleasant diversion nonetheless. Also starring

   is filled with shootings, stabbings, car crashes, impalements, 
   dismemberment, nudity, lesbianism and even a fairly graphic gang 
   rape, yet it still puts the viewer into a deep coma as it is filmed 
   in such a lazy, lackadaisical manner that the entire proceedings seem 
   boring. The film's thin storyline is about a gang of crooks (led by a 
   coked-out looking Russ Tamblyn and black actor J.C. Wells, who 
   portrays a character named &quot;Guido&quot;!) whom blackmail a 
   gambling-addicted girl (Jana Bellan) into giving them the route of a 
   money-carrying messenger who works at her stock brokerage firm. They 
   plan to rob the messenger, use the money to buy automatic weapons and 
   trade those weapons for drugs from some unnamed Latin American 
   country. Got it? What the gang didn't count on is being dogged by a 
   cop (Timothy Brown) who is out for revenge for the killing of his 
   partner by Tamblyn's hands.&nbsp; The film has many gaffes: The sound 
   of tires screeching and squealing on a dirt road, flubbed lines, 
   visible boom mikes and Regina Carrol's hilarious portrayal of a 
   lounge singer whose lips rarely match the lyrics she is crooning. 
   There is also some wild 70's fashions on view as the men walk around 
   in bell bottom pants and the women are either in bikinis, evening 
   gowns or pantsuits that were all the rage in that time period. A 
   subplot involving Brown and a lady TV reporter goes nowhere and is 
   just an excuse to show them in bed making love. The entire film is 
   shot in a series of long takes (some of them seeming to go on 
   forever) that will tax even the most patient viewers. They don't get 
   much worse than this and the only reason you can have for watching it 
   (besides being under the influence of a controlled substance) is for 
   the unintentional humor. Like most of Adamson's films it is known

   Priscilla (Kerry Lynn), and robbing the armored car driven by Bert

   plan: He takes Bert and the other two guards hostage and makes them

    wrath of his uptight boss, Mr. Mountgomery (Lloyd Nolan), who 
   dislikes Bert and follows behind the armored car with his beefy 
   bodyguard. This leads to a laughable car chase (Old lady with 
   shopping cart crossing the street? Check. Parked car opening door 
   just as car is whizzing by? Check. Driving the wrong way on a one-way 
   street? Check.), where Mountgomery's car crashes through a florist 
   shop (Well, at least it wasn't a fruits and vegetable stand!), 
   allowing the armored car to escape. Tommy and the gang knock-out Bert 
   and the guards with the gas again and return to the youth detention 
   center undetected, leaving the money with Priscilla. Back at the 
   police station, Bert is unable to identify the robbers and slugs a 
   detective when he insinuates that he was in on the robbery. 
   Mountgomery fires Bert from his job and tails him, but he eventually 
   helps Bert in investigating who the robbers really are (All Bert can 
   recall is that the leader of the gang's voice sounded familiar. 
   Hmmmmmm......). When Bert visits Tommy at the center, he finally puts 
   two-and-two together and reports his son's involvement to 
   Mountgomery, who goes to the facility and begins breaking down the 
   alibi's of Tommy and his friends (It's the film's best-written 
   section). The finale reveals that you should trust no one when it 
   comes to large sums of money.&nbsp; This tame thriller, directed by 
   Bethel Buckalew, who is best remembered for his string of 
   &quot;hicksploitation&quot; flicks, including <B><A HREF="country_cuzzins_1970.htm">COUNTRY

   (1971), amongst others, and co-written by Buckalew and Colleen Meeker 
   (Ralph's young wife), has a few action sequences, but is mostly a 
   dull drama about parent/child relationships. To say that this drama 
   is heavy-handed and unrealistic is a total understatement. Not only 
   is Tommy's relationship with Bert one of the bitterest father/son 
   dynamics on record, the husband/wife rapport between Meeker (a long 
   way from <B><A HREF="kiss_me_deadly_1955.htm">KISS ME DEADLY</A></B> 
   - 1955) and Lupino (who retired from filmmaking after appearing in 
   this) is one of the most hateful and acerbic marriages I have ever 
   seen. As a matter of fact, the only character in this film that 
   remotely has anything close to a human soul is kindly reformatory 
   guard Harry (David Doyle, &quot;Bosley&quot; from TV's <B><A HREF="charlies_angels_tv_series.htm">CHARLIE'S

   when he is interrogated by Mountgomery (In all fairness to Harry, he 
   murdered his abusive father when he was a teen, which now makes him 
   protective of &quot;my boys&quot; in the reformatory). You would 
   think that all this unpleasantness would make for good drama, but 
   Buckalew plays everything here squeaky clean. There is nary a profane 
   word spoken or a drop of blood spilled, which made this perfect TV 
   fodder, where it played in heavy rotation during the late 70's and 
   early 80's. To Buckalew's credit, he does try to throw in a surprise 
   ending (where character actor John Goff [<B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#PistolPackinLeroy">PISTOL</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="exploitation.htm#PistolPackinLeroy">-</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#PistolPackinLeroy">PACKIN'

   must admit that he is quite good here in a role that should have 
   bolstered his flagging career. Roddy Piper, in a supporting role, is 
   very menacing as the nearly indestructable Ice, who takes licking 
   after licking but keeps coming back for more. Filled with excellent 
   action and fighting scenes, including exploding bracelets and 
   countless gunfights that are well staged, this film also has 
   relentless tension that never lets up. This is a sure winner in a

   comes to his hotel door, Buddy grows a conscience and decides he is 
   not going to throw the game. He purposely breaks his arm in his 
   hotel's bathroom so he is not able to play. When his team wins in 
   double overtime, it pisses off Manuel's drug cartel boss, Carlos 
   (Robert Ahola), who sends Manuel and some goons to Buddy's house, 
   where they shoot Buddy's mother dead (the scene has some effect 
   since, when the mother slides down the bloodstained refrigerator, we 
   actually see a bullet hole in the refrigerator door, something most 
   low-budget films like this tend to leave out) and eventually shoot 
   and kill Buddy and his younger brother. Cut to the Honduras, where 
   Clete Harris (Wings Hauser; <B><A HREF="vice_squad_1982.htm">VICE SQUAD</A></B>

   - 1991), the older brother of Buddy, is working for The Peace Corps 
   (he's actually an undercover American agent passing info he hears to 
   our government). After making fun of his female counterpart Roberta's 
   (Nancy Locke, who was the real-life wife of Hauser at the time and 
   they both co-wrote the screenplay together) hairy armpits by showing 
   her a disposable razor and then mentioning deodorant, Clete learns of 
   his entire family's slaughter and heads back to the U.S. Yes, he is 
   now on a mission of revenge. Eventually (and I mean eventually, as it 
   seems to take forever), he hooks-up with Randy (Robert Tessier; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Nightwish1988">NIGHTWISH</A></B> 
   - 1988; in a larger than usual role), a mercenary who lives in a 
   plane graveyard with a young boy (who can strip and clean the most 
   complex of weapons!) and loves to blow things up, as he happily shows 
   Clete on several occasions. Clete doesn't want such powerful weapons 
   and decides to use a regular sidearm and a speedboat to get his 
   revenge on Manuel and his goons. He gets Manuel to follow him in 
   their speedboat and they do not see the explosives that Clete has put 
   in the water (I guess he really did want some powerful weapons after 
   all, one of the many unexplainable events in this film), blowing up 
   Manuel's boat, but when Manuel escapes the explosion, Clete runs him 
   over with his boat and watches Manuel sink to the bottom. He then 
   decides to go to South America to get revenge on Carlos, but he needs 
   help, something that Randy is glad to help with. After some comical 
   banter between the two about whether Randy knows how to fly a 
   helicopter (he does), Clete parachutes next to Carlos' compound and 
   sets timed explosives around the compound before beginning to 
   weed-out Carlos' goons. It ends with Carlos (who is duped into 
   letting Clete into the house when he displays the garrotted 
   decapitated head of Carlos' goon through the front door's peephole!) 
   being pulled up to the helicopter by Randy by way of a harness and a 
   well-placed hook (Randy begins to blow the hell out of the compound 
   with more rockets and machine gun fire than one helicopter could 
   possibly hold!), along with Clete on the ground shooting his way 
   through Carlos's massive goon squad while the timed explosives go 
   off. Randy picks up Clete (he jumps from a roof onto one of the 
   copter's landing gear) and they take off into the wild blue yonder 
   and drop Carlos off the helicopter without a parachute. THE END. It's 
   no wonder that this was Ronnie Rondell Jr.'s only directorial effort 
   because it is a disjointed film that contains scenes that make no 
   sense (like Clete screwing a girl in the back of a car as soon as he 
   gets home). Rondell is a supreme stuntman, but as a director, he 
   makes a good stuntman. The fault can't lie directly on his shoulders, 
   though, as Hauser and Locke's screenplay (they divorced in 1999) 
   doesn't make very much sense and a lot of the film is full of 
   nonsense dialogue that would even make a baby cringe (They also try 
   to throw in some social relevance into the film, like why Randy's 
   young boy doesn't go to school, but it falls flatter than a piece of 
   drywall). I am a big fan of Hauser (even though it seems his son Cole 
   Hauser has taken over the acting mantle, appearing in such films as <B><A HREF="2_fast_2_furious_2003.htm">2

   - 1961) rather than local talent and it suffers because of it. There 
   are plenty of action scenes (including a homage to <B><A HREF="wages_of_fear_1953.htm">WAGES
    OF FEAR</A></B> [1953], where Ted has to drive the truck over a 
   rickety bamboo bridge), but they lack the verve and the craziness 
   we've come to expect from this section of the Far East. The closest 
   this film comes to that craziness is the opening scene where Ted 
   spots the beautiful Judy in her Jeep, he gets instantly horny and he 
   chases her on his motorcycle, driving up on sidewalks, through an 
   outdoor cafe and generally ignoring anyone's safety until, finally, 
   he forces Judy to crash her Jeep into the front of a business, all 
   because he wanted to get laid! John Phillip Law looks like he is 
   having fun here (he's usually stiff as a hard-on in a whorehouse), 
   which is one of the film's saving graces. The other saving grace is 
   the scene where Van Cleef accidentally runs over one of his own men 
   in his Jeep and when Ted, Martin and Judy witness it, they all have a 
   good laugh after Martin says, &quot;He should have taken the 
   train!&quot; That's just what this film needed more of but, 
   unfortunately, it doesn't, so it's somewhat of a disappointment. It's 
   not awful, it's just that I expected more than what the final product 
   delivered. Christopher Mitchum, who would reach dizzying new heights

   in Curtis' crime syndicate and get even for friend Albert's murder. 
   Cut back to the old footage, where we watch Cindy shining shoes in a 
   cleavage-baring outfit, with a bunch of dirty old men waiting in line 
   for their turn (one horny man watches her through a hole he poked 
   through a newspaper, right next to a Hagar The Horrible comic 
   strip!). She is strong-armed by a street gang, who want her to 
   put-out sexually or pay protection money, but she beats them all to a 
   pulp with her kung-fu skills. Cindy and her three male friends are 
   just trying to find a way to survive on the mean streets of Hong Kong 
   without being caught by the cops and sent back to Mainland China. 
   They resort to petty theft and pick pocketing, but things take a turn 
   for the worse when Cindy picks the pockets of the Chief of 
   Detectives. Feeling guilty about stealing the Chief's wallet, Cindy 
   sneaks into his home and returns it, but instead of being happy about 
   getting his wallet back, the Chief orders his men to find Cindy and 
   her three male friends, no matter what it takes. Meanwhile, Ken has 
   infiltrated Curtis' organization, has gained Curtis' confidence and 
   is hired to be a member of his gang. Ken gets into several close 
   calls where his cover is nearly blown, but he manages to fight or 
   shoot his way out of them. The Chief and his squad relentlessly 
   pursue Cindy and her friends, but, time and time again, Cindy 
   escapes, leaving the Chief red-faced. When Frankie, one of Cindy's 
   friends, is caught, Cindy and her other two friends, Charles and 
   Paul, try to rescue him but are double-crossed by hobo Uncle Lee and 
   are also captured by the Chief. The Chief works out a deal with 
   Cindy: If she and her friends agree to go undercover and bring down a 
   crime syndicate in league with Curtis, he will let them live in Hong 
   Kong as legal citizens. When Cindy discovers that her rapist is part 
   of the syndicate, she's more than glad to take part. The finale finds 
   Cindy and her friends achieving their goals and Ken battling to the 
   death with Curtis in a Hong Kong water canal.&nbsp; This contains all 
   the normal Ho/Lai trademarks: Hilarious dialogue (script by Ho as 
   &quot;Benny Ho&quot;); obvious intercutting of old and new footage 
   (Whenever a phone rings in the old footage, you can bet that someone 
   in the new footage is on the other end); scenes of rape (Late in the 
   film, syndicate leader Eagle tries to rape Cindy and when she fights 
   back, he says, &quot;What's all the fuss? It's not as if you're a 
   virgin! What's wrong with a little cuddle?&quot;); stolen music cues 
   (Richard Band's theme from <B><A HREF="reanimator_1985b.htm">RE-ANIMATOR</A></B>

   those &quot;Ninja&quot; headbands) during one of Ken's fights. <B><A HREF="goddess_mission_1988.htm">GODDESS
    MISSION</A></B> is an entertaining mishmash that also contains a 
   catfight in a hot tub; a sub-plot about illegal aliens being 
   purposely abused and shafted by their employers; a couple of good 
   fight scenes (both in the old and new footage); and Mike Abbott's 
   steely glare. His eyes are so wide-open in some scenes (especially in 
   the opening and closing minutes), he looks like he's been on a 
   week-long coke-fueled binge. I'm a big fan of Mike's, since he's the 
   only actor I have ever seen that has a gap between both his upper and 
   lower teeth and still comes off as menacing. Also starring Gary

   and rescue American POWs that are still being held ten years after 
   the war has ended. Since the American government would rather the 
   public not be aware that there are Americans still being held in 
   captivity in Vietnam, the foursome enter Vietnam in secrecy and begin 
   their mission, aided by information supplied to them by their former 
   commanding officer, Major Morris (Italian genre director Enzo G. 
   Castellari; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Hammerhead1987">HAMMERHEAD</A></B> 
   - 1987), who was forced to retire because he wanted the government to 
   rescue the POWs. Once in Vietnam, our four heroes get help from 
   Father Lenoir (an extended cameo by Donald Pleasence), a French 
   priest who has been in Vietnam since the 1950's. He supplies the vets 
   with automatic weapons and explosives and then leads them on their 
   first leg of the journey. After helplessly watching a group of 
   Vietcong soldiers torturing an American POW in a river, the vets 
   follow the enemy back to their camp, where Richard's Nam flashback 
   nearly costs everyone their lives. Luckily, they are able to kill all 
   the guards and rescue a handful of POWs, including Mike (Ethan 
   Wayne), who tells them that the American government has been fully 
   aware of their captivity and location for the past ten years, even 
   sending government officials every year to check up on them, but have 
   done absolutely nothing in regards to their freedom. Now, our motley 
   group must make it out of Vietnam in one piece, which won't be easy 
   because both the Vietnamese and American governments don't want the 
   POWs to make it back to the States alive. After nearly making it to 
   safety, the three remaining vets are forced to make a decision that 
   will save their lives but certainly doom the POWs. In a scene that 
   will surely surprise most viewers, the trio agrees to the 
   arrangement, but as the final denouement reveals, the American 
   government can't be trusted to keep their word. It's one of the 
   bleakest endings of a war actioner that I have witnessed in quite 
   some time.&nbsp; Originally filmed as <A HREF="cobra_mission_1985.htm"><B>COBRA
    MISSION</B></A>, but changed to <B><A HREF="operation_nam_1985b.htm">OPERATION

   bloody war action and political intrigue (especially it's 
   anti-American slant), which I'm sure would not please Ethan Wayne's 
   father, John 'Duke' Wayne, if he were still alive at the time of this 
   film's production. This film has a striking hatred of American 
   policies and politics and there are some amazing scenes to illustrate 
   this bias, including a young Vietnamese woman who removes her blouse, 
   revealing her horribly burned breasts. She says just two words, 
   &quot;American napalm&quot;, before shooting Mark several times in 
   the stomach with a pistol, killing him. Up until that shocking 
   moment, the sequence is played as a love scene, where we are led to 
   believe that Mark and the woman were abo<A HREF="cobra_mission_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cobra mission dutch vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="156" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ut
    to have sex. The four vets are also the most unlikely heroes in a 
   war film. Roger is a slacker who lives off his wife's fortune and has 
   to be pulled away from playing video games on his TV on the day of 
   his daughter's wedding. Richard has spent the last ten years in 
   voluntary committal in a mental institution because he doesn't want 
   to live in society. Mark is a hothead who only finds satisfaction 
   when he beats up people who ridicule or put down Vietnam veterans 
   (There's one scene at a bar where the dialogue is so vitriolic, I 
   wanted to beat the shit out of the two bar patrons!). James is a 
   loner who takes odd jobs as he travels from town-to-town, because he 
   just doesn't know how to relate to people. Director Fabrizio 
   DeAngelis (<B><A HREF="#DeadlyImpact">DEADLY IMPACT</A></B> - 1984; <B><A HREF="#ManHunt1984">MAN
    HUNT</A></B> - 1984; <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#KarateWarrior">KARATE

   (under his frequent pseudonym &quot;Larry Ludman&quot;), A.J. Bleman 
   and European exploitation staple Erwin C. Dietrich, seems to be 
   implying that the Vietnam war has permanently damaged not only the 
   soldiers that fought in it, but also the governments responsible for 
   it. It's a nihilistic view that is best summed-up by the film's 
   remarkably downbeat finale, where American Colonel Mortimer (Gordon 
   Mitchell; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BloodDelirium1988">BLOOD DELIRIUM</A></B> 
   - 1988) rescues the three remaining vets, but makes them leave Mike, 
   the sole surviving POW, behind to be recaptured by the Vietcong. It's 
   an image you won't soon forget. The nihilism doesn't end there, 
   though. We're informed that Roger was killed in an auto 
   &quot;accident&quot; two weeks after he returned to the States; James 
   died while piloting a helicopter in Thailand; and the final image is 
   of Richard back in the mental hospital, only this time it's not of 
   his own choice. He sits in a wheelchair, obviously in a drugged-out 
   haze, his eyes showing no signs of humanity. As far as Vietnam war

   Thai government sends a man in undercover to a guerilla compound to 
   bring down Thailand's biggest drug lord, who supplies opium to most 
   of the world and buy guns and men with his profits. He joins a group 
   of thugs that the compound is training to become soldiers for the 
   drug lord's army. A local warlord stops by the camp to complain to 
   the drug lord (&quot;You do not respect me!&quot;), only to be 
   ambushed by Burmese troops as he leaves the camp. He is saved by a 
   mysterious stranger (actually another government spy) who guns down 
   all the troops. The warlord brings him back to his camp. The first 
   undercover guy <A HREF="opium_strike_force_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/opium strike force vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="102" HEIGHT="194" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>meets
    two other men that the government sent to help him. They watch the 
   camp carefully, looking for any weaknesses that they can exploit 
   later on. When the warlord finds out that the troops that attacked 
   him were not Burmese but, rather, the drug lord's men in disguise, he 
   goes back to the drug lord's compound , only to be beat up and 
   injected with drugs. After disciplining his men for being 
   insubordinate (he shoots three of them point blank), the drug lord 
   send his new recruits on their first drug run but, for some reason, 
   the undercover guy is chained-up and stays behind. He becomes friends 
   with the compound's only female soldier, Tulip (!), after fixing her 
   Jeep. (When he tells her that he was in prison, she asks him, 
   &quot;Were you in for robbery?&quot; He replies matter-of-factly, 
   &quot;No, I killed my wife and her mother in bed.&quot;) He sets up a 
   series of events that will pit the drug lord's men against the 
   warlord's men (turns out the warlord was Tulip's uncle). Many 
   gunfights and explosions follow once the drug lord shoots the warlord 
   in front of Tulip. I dare anyone to make sense of the 
   incomprehensible Indonesian piece of crap. I love Indonesian action 
   films, but this one sorely lacks the rapid-fire pace, violence and 
   kinetic energy associated with with many films from this region (i.e. <B><A HREF="#Final Score">FINAL
    SCORE</A></B> - 1986). This film just drags from beginning to end 
   and very little of it is interesting. The dubbing is especially dicey 
   (everyone talks like William Shatner, as there are long pauses in 
   mid-sentence) as is the photography (it's either extreme close-ups or 
   long shots). Even the most exploitable elements are handled poorly. 
   There's an auction for prostitutes at the compound (there aren't 
   enough women to go around) and the resulting nudity and gang rape of 
   one girl is so confusingly shot, it ruins the effectiveness. Even the 
   violence is tame by Indonesian standards. Just a few bullets to the 
   head and body and a couple of beatdowns. Of course, there's plenty of 
   gunfire, explosions and things on fire, but none of it interesting or 
   exciting. I must say I was highly disappointed. I expected craziness 
   and got laziness instead. You can't win them all. Also known as <B><A HREF="raiders_of_the_golden_triangle_1985.htm">RAIDERS

    THE IDOL</A></B> (1986; which utilizes most of the same people, both 
   in front and behind the camera), a group of ski mask-wearing 
   terrorists kidnap laser specialist Dr. George Brinkmann Jr. (Stephan 
   Krayn) in a daring raid at an awards ceremony in Geneva, Switzerland 
   and take him by helicopter to an unknown destination. In Washington, 
   D.C., we watch international super spy and expert thief Duncan Jax 
   (Ian Hunter, who resembles a balding Michael Bolton!) stealing a box 
   of big-ass diamonds from a secure facility run by a bunch of 
   towelheaded Arabs and escaping into the night in a small plane 
   piloted by his baboon sidekick, Boon (yeah, you read that right). 
   After delivering the diamonds to his boos, Star (C.K. Bibby), by 
   landing the plane in his boss's front yard while a cocktail party is 
   in progress, Duncan is informed that Dr. Brinkmann was kidnapped by 
   neo-Nazi group The Order Of The Black Eagle, which is headed by Baron 
   Von Tepish (William T. Hicks; <B><A HREF="house_of_death_1982.htm">HOUSE

    Duncan is informed that he and Boon must rescue Dr. Brinkmann from 
   the Baron's secret headquarters, an ancient temple in South America. 
   Star isn't sure why the Baron has kidnapped Dr. Brinkmann, but he is 
   sure of two things: 1) The Baron is having a lot of expensive laser 
   equipment shipped to his headquarters and 2) whatever is going to 
   happen is probably going to take place on Hitler's birthday, which is 
   rapidly approaching. By a stroke of extremely good luck (some would 
   say it is too good to be true), Duncan bears a striking resemblance 
   to an enemy agent recently captured who was supposed to deliver a 
   bunch of laser equipment to the Baron's headquarters, so Duncan takes 
   his place. He, along with Boon (how in the world will he explain the 
   baboon to the Baron?) and undercover Interpol agent Tiffany 
   Youngblood (Jill Donnellan), head to South America, but not before 
   they are equipped with some gadgets by their Q-like contraption 
   maker, Sato (Shangtai Tuan). The Baron has a new laser weapon called 
   the Proton Beam, which he demonstrates by blowing a satellite out of 
   the sky (He says, &quot;Tonight, many Americans will not get their 
   HBO!&quot;). He plans on using the Proton Beam to destroy America and 
   he also has the cryogenically frozen body of Hitler, which he plans 
   on reviving on his birthday and try once again to become ruler of the 
   world (Won't the Nazis ever learn?). Duncan and Tiffany's true 
   identities are soon discovered and Duncan escapes into the jungle, 
   where he joins Star and a squad of mercenaries, including females 
   Maxie (Anna Rapagna) and Spike (Flo Hyman; who died during filming, 
   which explains her absence in the finale), on a raid of the Baron's 
   headquarters to rescue Tiffany and Dr. Brinkmann, destroy the Proton 
   Beam and kill the Baron and Hitler. The finale is a mixture of gory 
   violence, heroic derring-do and explosive action, as the Baron's 
   headquarters is reduced to nothing but a pile of rubble and mangled 
   bodies.&nbsp; This ridiculously cheap sub-James Bond adventure, 
   directed by former Earl Owensby prot&eacute;g&eacute; Worth Keeter (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Dogs Of Hell">DOGS

   Unlike the Bond adventures, the action here is R-rated, as Duncan Jax 
   has no trouble decapitating, blowing-up or riddling his enemies with 
   bullets. Keeter throws-in every cheap trick in the book, including 
   Nazis who like to say the word &quot;Jew&quot; a lot; a hilarious 
   Spaghetti Western take-off where Duncan pretends to be gay (!) to 
   distract the banditos while Star and the mercenaries board a bus; 
   Boon the baboon, whose only talents seem to be flipping the bird to 
   anyone he dislikes, throwing grenades or driving vehicles; a couple 
   of high speed chases, one of the motorcycle variety (which ends in a 
   decapitation) and the other a speedboat chase (which results in a 
   couple of nifty boat explosions, complete with shredded bodies); and 
   the action-packed finale, where Duncan and the mercenaries use their 
   individual talents to slaughter their opponents. If you don't mind 
   awful acting (William T. Hicks' German accent is horrendous); a plot 
   that can best be described as outlandish; and some less-than-stellar 
   makeup effects (especially Hitler's demise in the finale), you may 
   find yourself enjoying this violent and stunt-filled James Bond 
   rip-off. Also starring Bill Gribble, Gene Sherer, Wolfgang Linkman, 
   Joe Coltrane, James Eric, Terry Loughlin and Dean Whitworth.

   of his duties, thereby becoming the New Master (I know it makes no 
   sense, but just go with it). This film is about Ben's exploits in 
   achieving that goal. Unfortunately, Ben's country has been invaded 
   and taken over by an army of feathery hat-wearing Spanish marauders 
   (this film looks to take place in the late 15th Century), led by 
   brothers Miguel (Dean Stockwell, who looks like he's trying out for a 
   dry run of <B><A HREF="dune_1984.htm">DUNE</A></B> [1984] and has a

   from Allan (which he pays) and Antonio tries to rape Allan's wife, 
   Maria (Gloria Seville), Allan and Ben break out the Arnis sticks to 
   defend her honor. They beat the crap out of Miguel and Antonio and 
   Ben makes them both get on their knees and apologize to his parents. 
   Since no good deed goes unpunished, the Governor and an army of 
   Spaniards pay a late night visit to Allan's house, where the Governor 
   kills Allan by running him through with a sword (but not before Allan 
   burns him on the face with a torch) and then rapes and viciously 
   stabs Maria, killing her, but not before Maria castrates him with a 
   knife (we see his castrated penis fall to the floor!). Ben is forced 
   to watch his parents being killed and is later convicted of &quot;acts

   slave ship in shackles and abused and jumps overboard during a 
   violent storm (but not before killing the ship's captain by throwing

   man?&quot;) hires Japanese samurai Mori (Hiroshi Tanaka; <B><A HREF="ninja_wars_1982.htm">NINJA

   Governor sends his sons and a battalion of soldiers to the tropical 
   island to look for all the slaves lost during the shipwreck, not 
   knowing that Ben is also there. The old white blind medicine man 
   takes Ben under his wing and hides him out. Leni and other native

   turns out to be a distraction so Ben and other native men can steal

    This latest chapter is much more ribald and sexual than the first 
   two and contains a lot of gay stereotypes, homosexual humor and fat 
   jokes. The underbosses, led by hook-handed Manny (Dick Adair, who 
   also co-wrote the screenplay with Joseph Zucchero), grow tired of 
   Devlin's mistreatment, so they kidnap his daughter, Debbie (Cynthia 
   Rodrigo) and give Devlin 72 hours to deliver one million dollars and 
   turn over all his business documents or they will kill Debbie. Devlin 
   calls Interpol agent Cleopatra Wong in Singapore to help him rescue 
   his daughter. Cleo agrees to help Devlin in exchange that when his 
   daughter is safe, he turns over to Cleo all the names and details of 
   his drug business. Devlin agrees and Cleo goes about putting together 
   a team, which includes flamboyantly gay corrupt ex-cop Terry (an 
   over-the-top Franco Guerrero, here billed as &quot;Chito 
   Guerrero&quot;) and an extremely overweight female psychic with the 
   descriptive name of Rotunda (Florence Carvajal). This extremely 
   unlikely trio then goes about finding the three underbosses, Manny, 
   Moe and Jack (!), with each one going after a different underboss. 
   Terry goes undercover (dressed as a female hooker!) to meet Manny at 
   his bar (Terry introduces him/herself to Manny by saying, &quot;I'm a 
   virgin...with lots of references!&quot; to which Manny replies, 
   &quot;Guess which hand has the peanut? [After placing Terry's hand on 
   his crotch] This one!&quot;). Rotunda goes to Moe's (Danny Rojo) 
   gambling parlor, where she uses her psychic powers to win at 
   blackjack. Cleo pretends to be a junkie to get close to Jack (Ted 
   Deelman). Unfortunately, all three strike out in their pursuits of 
   their prey, so they rethink their strategy and decide to work as a 
   team to rescue Debbie, which leads to many martial arts fights and 
   the unlikeliest motorcycle/car chase in film history. The finale 
   takes place on the beach, where the trio must not only save Debbie 
   (who is buried up to her neck in the sand with high tide 
   approaching), but also Devlin, who has decided to pay the ransom 
   (after witnessing how inept Cleo and her two friends really are), but 
   Manny, Moe and Jack double cross him anyway.&nbsp; Bobby A. Suarez is

    is nowhere as prolific as Cirio H. Santiago, but he is much more 
   consistent) and this film is a good indicator why. Suarez never takes 
   the material seriously (in lesser hands, the gay humor and fat jokes 
   would probably be considered offensive, but here they are just 
   goofy), yet he manages to give all the heroes and villains distinct 
   personalities and dishes out tons of intentionally funny one-liners, 
   including &quot;How would you like to get fingered by Captain 
   Hook?&quot; and &quot;I want Manny's ass, not his pants!&quot; (I 
   also like how Debbie teases Manny by calling him &quot;Hooky&quot; 
   and watching him doing a slow burn while saying, &quot;I'll show you 
   hooky!&quot; as he waves his metal appendage in the air.). The action 
   scenes are purposely staged to be humorous, especially Terry's 
   martial arts fights (he gets a precarious thrill every time he 
   touches a bad guy's ass) and the obese Rotunda (who is never without 
   some type of food in her purse, including sandwiches and bananas) 
   walking up a rickety wooden ladder and then trying to shimmy across a 
   trapeze wire, only to have the wire snap, causing her to crash 
   through a cement wall. The sight of Cleo, Terry and Rotunda riding 
   down the highway in a combination motorcycle/sidecar is an image that

   theaters under the title <B><A HREF="devils_three_1979d.htm">DEVIL'S

    SOLDIERS</A><A NAME="PhantomSoldiers"></A> (1987) -</B> War action 
   as only the Filipinos can do it. The film opens with a squad of 
   faceless (thanks to the gasmasks they are wearing) Phantom Soldiers, 
   all dressed in black bio-suits and impervious to bullets and pain, as 
   they raid a North Vietnamese village. They enter the village with 
   guns and grenade launchers blazing, slaughtering innocent men, women 
   and children until they corner the surviving villagers at a 
   beachhead, where they release canisters of poison nerve gas and watch 
   callously as the exposed villagers gasp their last breaths. As they 
   exit the destroyed village, one of the soldiers leaves their calling 
   card: a human skull on a pole with two crossed swords tattooed across 
   the forehead. At the Texas/Mexico border halfway across the world, 
   Texas Ranger Daniel Custer (Max Thayer; <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#Retrievers">THE
    RETRIEVERS</A></B> - 1982) leads some DEA agents on a raid of a 
   Mexican drug lord's compound, which leads to a massive gun battle 
   with multiple explosions, resulting in Daniel capturing his prey. 
   Back in Vietnam, Daniel's brother, Lt. Michael Custer (Corwyn Sperry; <B><A HREF="#BattleRats">BATTLE
    RATS</A></B> - 1<A HREF="phantom_soldiers_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/phantom soldiers german vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="153" HEIGHT="264" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>988),
    leads a platoon of soldiers on a recon mission and stumble upon the 
   slaughtered village. This isn't the first time that Lt. Custer has 
   witnessed the after-effects of the Phantom Soldiers (his commanding 
   officer has a collection of tattooed skulls back at base camp), so he 
   disobeys direct orders and hunts down the phantom platoon with his 
   own squad of soldiers, which includes tracker Red Legs (co-scripter 
   Jim Gaines). Lt. Custer and his men are led into a trap after meeting 
   CIA operative Colonel Hammer (Jack Yates), who offers to take them to 
   the CIA's secret camp. Lt. Custer ends up missing in action, so 
   Korean War veteran brother Daniel heads to Vietnam to search for him. 
   Daniel proves his worthiness as a soldier when he single-handedly 
   saves a squad of American soldiers from a VC surprise assault. When 
   The U.S. refuses to help him find his brother, Daniel gets help from 
   a captured VC soldier, who leads him to the secret CIA base, where 
   Daniel is knocked-out and captured by Colonel Hammer. As Daniel will 
   soon find out, his own government and Russia are behind the creation 
   of the Phantom Soldiers, but will he or his brother survive to tell 
   the world the truth?&nbsp; Action-packed and bloody as hell, this 
   Philippines-lensed flick, directed by action specialist Teddy Page (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Blood Debts">BLOOD
    DEBTS</A></B> - 1983; <B><A HREF="#JungleRats">JUNGLE RATS</A></B> - 
   1987), here billed as &quot;Irvin Johnson&quot;, contains many 
   well-staged action set-pieces and a good amount of weird visuals, 
   especially when the jackbooted, gasmasked Phantom Soldiers attack. 
   The opening slaughter of the North Vietnamese village has an 
   otherworldly feel to it, as the Phantom unit looks more like aliens 
   than they do soldiers, indiscriminately killing everyone in their 
   path, be it men, women or children, without the slightest sign of 
   hesitation or remorse. The script, by co-star Jim Gaines (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#BlackFire1985">BLACK
    FIRE</A></B> - 1985; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Robowar">ROBOWAR</A></B> 
   - 1988) and Rod Davies, is full of the prerequisite action scenes 
   we've come to depend on from these Filipino actioners (plenty of 
   bloody bullet squibs, including graphic gunshots to the head and lots 
   of things blowing up in huge fireballs) and some good slow-motion 
   scenes of death and destruction, but there's also some very unique 
   and unusual touches on view. For one, Daniel and Michael wear each 
   other's badges of honor as a sign of brotherly love. Michael wears 
   Daniel's Texas Ranger badge in Vietnam and Daniel wears Michael's 
   Bronze Star back in Texas. It's a simple and effective way to express 
   their commitment to each other without getting maudlin. There are 
   also a few bits of dialogue that reveals that Daniel is against the 
   war in Vietnam, even though his brother is fighting in it, especially 
   the scene where he sets his VC prisoner free, even tossing him a 
   nudie magazine as a souvenir. Unusual for a film of this type. Still, 
   this is a good, old-fashioned war actioner at heart and <B><A HREF="phantom_soldiers_1987b.htm">PHANTOM
    SOLDIERS</A> </B>(also known as <B><A HREF="commando_phantom_1987.htm">COMMANDO

   extra &quot;oomph&quot; raises it a notch or two above the norm. Also 
   starring Richard King, Mike Monty, David Anderson, John Fulch and 
   Edward Burnett. Never legitimately available on home video in the

    THE WARRIORS</A><A NAME="PlatoonTheWarriors"></A> (1988) -</B> When 
   producer Joseph Lai wasn't churning-out countless cut-and-paste 
   martial arts flicks (most with the word &quot;Ninja&quot; in the 
   title), he was cranking-out straight-ahead cut-and-paste actioners 
   such as this one, directed by Philip Ko (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#AmericanForce3">AMERICAN
    FORCE 3: HIGH SKY MISSION</A></B> - 1989). This one opens with 
   villain Rex (Mike Abbott; <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#HandsOfDeath1987">HANDS
    OF DEATH</A></B> - 1987) double-crossing Bill (Mark Watson) in a 
   drug deal. Bill runs for his life after Rex and his men gun down all 
   of Bill's crew and he runs smack-dab into two ninjas dressed in 
   yellow (Wait! Is this a ninja film after all? Nah, this is the last 
   we see them.), who steal Bill's briefcase full of money and deliver 
   it to Rex. Bill escapes with his life and vows revenge. We then cut 
   to the film proper (which looks to be some unreleased Filipino crime 
   film), where we watch a gang of crooks, headed by Ray, rob a liquor 
   store and then kill an eyewitness named Michael as they hop in their 
   car to make their getaway. In an awful example of intercutting old 
   and new footage, Rex calls the leader of another Filipino gang on the 
   phone to remind him that he has a lot of money riding on the big 
   prize fight and to make sure nothing goes wrong (<A HREF="platoon_the_warriors_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/platoon the warriors poster front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>After
    Rex tells the gang leader to murder anyone who gets in the way, he 
   hangs up the phone. The leader turns to his gang and says, &quot;That 
   was Rex. Nothing, really.&quot; What?!?). Meanwhile, Michael's older 
   brother Jack begins looking for Ray and his gang, based on a partial 
   license plate number Michael wrote down in his own blood while he was 
   dying. Jack starts tearing up the town looking for Ray and his three 
   cohorts, getting into a series of fights with various lowlifes and 
   stopping long enough to frolic in the ocean and screw his girlfriend 
   Amy. Jack turns down Bill's offer to join forces (more bad 
   intercutting), so Bill dresses in Army fatigues and, every twenty 
   minutes or so, interrupts the main film to begin killing members of 
   Rex's gang. When Jack's father is gunned-down at the big prize fight, 
   Jack steps-up his beat-downs, which pisses-off Ray, who shoots-up 
   Jack's house, killing his mother and sister and kidnapping another 
   sister named Jenny (Jack is not having a good week, is he?). To add 
   insult to injury, Ray rapes Jenny repeatedly and then offers her to 
   the rest of his gang, before releasing her (Well, at least he didn't 
   kill her!). Jack puts down his fists and picks up automatic weapons 
   (including a strange looking tommy gun) and begins killing everyone 
   associated with Ray, including the gang Rex is involved with (well, 
   at least in this bastardized version). The rest of the film is 
   nothing but a series of shootouts and fisticuffs and, in the finale, 
   Jack faces-off with Ray, while Rex and Bill (who are now dressed in 
   green army fatigues) shoot it out and then duke it out until Rex 
   blows himself up with a hand grenade. My brain hurts!&nbsp; It should 
   come as no surprise that the &quot;screenplay&quot; to this IFD Films 
   And Arts Ltd. production was written by Godfrey Ho (as &quot;Benny 
   Ho&quot;), because it contains all the priceless hilariously-bad 
   dubbed dialogue we've come to expect from him, such as one bad guy 
   saying to another, &quot;Did you meet a nice girl? With big 
   ones?&quot; or, on discovering that Jack is still alive, Ray retorts, 
   &quot;So, Jack's alive. We'll have to remedy that!&quot; The pinnacle 
   of hilarity comes when Rex, upon hearing that Bill is supplying 
   weapons to Jack, turns to one of his underlings and says, &quot;Damn 
   that bastard! Hold on, I gotta take a piss!&quot; He pulls out his 
   dick and begins pissing in the woods, just as Bill arrives on the 
   scene and begins shooting-up the woods. The shot of Rex running away 
   while trying to zip-up his fly will have you rolling on the floor. 
   The old footage is much more entertaining than the new footage 
   (sometimes it's the other way around on other pastiche films from 
   Lai, but not this time) and contains a <B><A HREF="raiders_of_the_lost_ark_1981.htm">RAIDERS
    OF THE LOST ARK</A></B>-inspired moment when Jack comes face-to-face 
   with an expert knife handler, but after he's done putting on a show 
   of his knife-twirling abilities, Jack shoots him dead and moves on. <B><A HREF="platoon_the_warriors_1988c.htm">PLATOON

   sister and then gets revenge through the barrel of a gun. The newly

   pretty disposable. Director Philip Ko is certainly no Godfrey Ho. I

    DEATHCAMP</A><A NAME="POWDeathcamp"></A> (1988) -</B> This Filipino 
   war action film opens up with an on-screen crawl informing us that, 
   in 1966, the U.S. Government planned on ending the Vietnam War by 
   dropping an atom bomb on Hanoi. When the person in charge of that 
   mission, Captain James Brooks, is captured by the enemy, a band of 
   mercenaries, led by Aviles (Rey Malonzo of <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Classified Operatio">CLASSIFIED
    OPERATION</A></B> - 1985), are hired to rescue Capt. Brooks. They 
   fight the enemy in the jungle while trying to avoid spiked booby 
   traps (one of Aviles' men steps on a tripwire and gets spiked through 
   his leg) and being massively outnumbered. They save a village girl 
   after she is bitten by a cobra, only they end up being captured by 
   the enemy and sent to a P.O.W. camp. Aviles and his men are tied-up 
   and forced to watch as the sadistic camp warden forces two prisoners 
   to <A HREF="pow_deathcamp_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pow deathcamp vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="231" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>arm
    wrestle each other, the loser getting shot in the stomach when his 
   opponent's hand touches a lever that pulls the gun's trigger. As the 
   deaths pile up, thanks to the arm wrestling contest and an 
   unsuccessful escape attempt by four American soldiers (who are all 
   shot and killed), Aviles and his men must come up with an escape plan 
   before they are killed. Aviles' second-in-command, Jun (Charles 
   Black), narrowly misses being killed in the arm wrestling contest 
   when he beats the ten-time champion, which leads to Aviles and Jun 
   escaping. They begin to systematically kill the camp guards, 
   eventually freeing all the prisoners. The sadistic camp warden 
   gathers his remaining men and hunts down Aviles and the P.O.Ws. 
   Easier said than done, as Aviles and his men are experts in jungle 
   warfare. The rest of the film is nothing but a series of gun battles 
   and fistfights, ending with a massacre on the banks of a river, where 
   everyone, including the snake-bitten girl from the beginning of the 
   film, loses their lives in a hail of bullets. Isn't war 
   wonderful?&nbsp; This film proves that not all Filipino action films 
   can be winners. Director Jett C. Espirito (<B><A HREF="vengeance_squad_1987.htm">VENGEANCE
    SQUAD</A></B> - 1987), working with a minimal script supplied by 
   Jeffrey Woods or Bonnie Paradez (since the opening credits lists 
   Woods and the closing credits list Paradez as the screenwriter), 
   doesn't have much to work with here, just a basic premise (that's 
   immediately dropped) followed by lots of shooting and hand-to-hand 
   combat. Ignore the synopsis on the back of the video box, as whoever 
   wrote it obviously didn't watch the film. The only part of the 
   synopsis that's even partly true is that Capt. James Brooks (called 
   &quot;Captain Steiner&quot; on the box) is at the P.O.W. camp that 
   Aviles (called &quot;Lt. Comez&quot; on the box) and his men are sent 
   to. Problem is, he's not alive, as the camp warden reveals Brooks 
   body to his new captives. It's a skeleton wearing Brooks' uniform! 
   All the other character names listed on the back of the box are also 
   false.&nbsp; The middle section of the film, when everyone is at the 
   P.O.W. camp, is filmed at night and most of the time it is too dark 
   to make out what is going on. For a war film, it's not very bloody, 
   just a few bloody bullet squibs and a couple of booby trap 
   impalements (and they both look to have been edited to delete the 
   gore, even though this tape doesn't carry a rating). I was kind of 
   excited to watch this when I found a copy on <A HREF="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</A> 
   since I never heard of it before, but once I got about twenty minutes 
   into it, I knew that I wasn't in for anything special. It lacked 
   craziness that makes a lot of other Filipino actioners so memorable. 
   Oh, well. They can't all be winners. Also starring George Estregan,

   works at the office, and her new husband Michael (Bob Fall), stop by 
   to pick up their airline tickets that Casey mistakenly left there. 
   Michael gets taken hostage by the hoods, but Casey gets away and 
   alerts a security guard (who gets himself killed) and is then 
   arrested by the cops.&nbsp; When two cops and Nick the Knife are 
   killed in a shootout, Casey convinces Police Captain Rader (McKeiver 
   Jones III) that she is a victim (and that her husband is an ex-NYC 
   cop). Word gets out to the TV news (the Mayor just happens to be 
   banging TV news reporter Carla [Ona Simms] when he gets the call from 
   Rader) and it turns into a major media event. Mad Dog demands 
   $100,000 and transportation out of town. To divulge any more would be 
   to spoil any little entertainment this wretched piece of flotsam has 
   to offer. Let's just say Casey has less brains than the crooks, as 
   she decides to take the law into her own hands. Good luck, Michael.

   (1959). Director Rick Pamplin (who, thankfully, switched to 
   documentaries) looks like he had a $500 budget to work with (the 
   crowd scenes consists of about five people) and hasn't got a clue how 
   to build suspense. As with most films of this type, the press is 
   portrayed as unfeeling and one-sided (Reporter Carla says to Casey, 
   &quot;You know your husband is probably dead, right?&quot;) and the 
   cops are clueless, taking orders from a mayor who is more worried 
   about his political future than the hostages' lives. The film is full 
   of illogical situations (Who in their right mind would send a 
   reporter into the building to interview the hostage takers and 
   broadcast it live?) and inane dialogue, such as when Big Mama says to 
   her son, &quot;No pussy without checking with me first!&quot; My mama 
   never said that to me. She could have saved me a divorce if she did. 
   When Casey just happens to run into Machine Gun Joe, an arms dealer, 
   in the middle of the street and gives her a prototype automatic 
   weapon for free (provided Joe goes with her on the assault!), you'll 
   throw your hands up in the air and scream, &quot;Aw, c'mon!&quot; And 
   let's not forget the rape scene where Loverboy and Slick rape one of 
   the hostages while all of them are fully-clothed! As with all Raedon

   Mercenary Sugar (James Mitchum of <B><A HREF="#Code Name Zebra">CODE

   fellow mercenary Mark (Cris Ahrens of <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Shocking Dark">SHOCKING

   sends his right-hand man, Tao (Franklin Dominguez), to go along with 
   them. As they trek through the jungle, the three are relentlessly 
   pursued by VC soldiers and get into a few firefights until they reach 
   an area called &quot;The Hell Which No One Returns&quot;, which is 
   strangely silent and lacks any wildlife. They find a boat (full of 
   skeletons) and use it to travel down river until they reach the 
   &quot;Territory Of The Monks&quot;, a ghastly-looking religious sect 
   that practices black magic and possibly cannibalism. After a couple 
   of close calls with spiked boobytraps and bulletproof monks, our 
   intrepid trio find the monks' hidden underground temple and the magic 
   ivory tablet (which lets whoever holds it to become invisible). After 
   stealing the tablet and saving a girl named My Lei (Clarissa Mendez) 
   from sacrifice, they fight their way back to the extraction point, 
   low on ammo and food. A betrayal two-thirds of the way through the 
   movie leaves our heroes looking for revenge.&nbsp; This Italian 
   action/adventure film is nothing special, but I have watched a lot 
   worse than this. Director Tonino Ricci (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Panic 1976">PANIC</A></B>

   1983), once again using his &quot;Anthony Richmond&quot; pseudonym, 
   crosses many genres here, mixing one part war, one part action, one 
   part horror and one part adventure into one uneven, but generally 
   entertaining flick. The script by Italian writer Dardano Sacchetti 
   (using his &quot;David Parker Jr.&quot; pseudonym) is full of the 
   dialogue we expect in films like this, such as, &quot;Were you born 
   an asshole or did you just work at it?&quot; and &quot;Up your ass, 
   motherfucker!&quot; Typical Oscar-worthy stuff. Be warned that the 
   bloodletting is rather tame and, save for some bullet hits and 
   explosions, is practically non-existant. James Mitchum is his normal 
   wooden self and adopts the same non-acting style that his brother 
   Chris Mitchum (<B><A HREF="#Final Score">FINAL SCORE</A></B> - 1986) 
   uses. I must confess, though, that I always wanted to see these two 
   star as brothers in an Indonesian action film, because those 
   Indonesian directors are hyper-crazy. The Italians don't seem to want 
   to take the chances that the Indonesians do. And that's the problem

    Brodie and Talbot save Sierra (Lani Lobangco) from the clutches of 
   two mutants, when Brodie discovers that she is a native of a 
   legendary place called the &quot;Gate To The Sun&quot;, where 
   &quot;black powder&quot; is plentiful thanks to a large potassium 
   mine there. Brodie and Talbot think it would be best if they split up 
   at the next town. Talbot will go undercover in Hoghead's gang looking 
   for his wife and Brodie and Sierra will go to her village where 
   Brodie can collect some gunpowder and bring it back to headquarters. 
   With the help of a group of dwarves (a recurring theme in nearly all 
   of Santiago's post-nuke films) from Sierra's village, Brodie (who is 
   injured protecting the little people) and Sierra make it to the 
   village. Hoghead and his gang go to the Captain's headquarters, where 
   they kill the Captain and steal most of their gunpowder. Talbot is

   Colonel Clay makes it to Sierra's village and Brodie and the 
   villagers must protect the village's huge potassium mine from the 
   invading forces. The finale finds Brodie (who has fallen in love with 
   Sierra) fighting arch-nemesis Coloney Clay in hand-to-hand combat and 
   Talbot and a freed Vera battling Hoghead (who actually wears a hat 
   made from a hog's head!). When Sierra ends up dead by Colonel Clay's

   (2008) -</B> While I generally don't review recent theatrical 
   releases, I'm going to make an exception here because I feel this is 
   an important, nay, essential, viewing experience for fans of action 
   cinema. Quite simply, this is the best 80's action film to be made in 
   the past twenty years and director/co-scripter/star Sylvester 
   Stallone has single-handedly restored my faith in American action 
   cinema. It's not perfect, mind you, but it is the most rousing, 
   bloody, audience-pleasing action flick that I have seen in theaters 
   in many years. Stallone returns for the fourth time as a much older 
   and even more world-weary John Rambo, who now lives in Thailand as a 
   fisherman and snake catcher. A bunch of Christian missionaries want 
   to hire Rambo and his boat to take them down river into Burma, where 
   they plan to give medical attention and teach the word of God to a 
   village of innocent souls. The missionaries, led by self-righteous 
   doctor Michael Burnett (Paul Schulze) and his do-gooder girlfriend 
   Sarah (Julie Benz), know that the Burmese people have been going 
   through a bloody genocide for over sixty years, where a cruel 
   National Army commits various atrocities against the people 
   (including a painful-to-watch game of forcing villagers to cross a 
   live minefield), but since they believe God is on their side, they 
   think they are safe from harm (yeah, right). At first Rambo refuses 
   (he turns his back<A HREF="rambo_2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rambo 2008 poster2 small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   on them and says, &quot;Fuck the world!&quot;), but Miss Goody Two 
   Shoes convinces him and he finally relents. He takes them down river, 
   drops them off (after a harrowing episode with some river pirates) 
   and returns to his simple (and still nightmare-filled) life. A short 
   time later, the entire village is wiped-out by sadistic homosexual 
   military leader Tint (Maung Maung Khin) and his army (in one of the 
   most bloody massacres ever committed to celluloid) and the 
   missionaries are all taken prisoner and held captive in bamboo cages 
   (one of them is fed live to a bunch of hungry pigs!). Rambo is then 
   hired by the head of the Christian missionary (Ken Howard in a cameo 
   role) to take a squad of mercenaries down river to save the 
   missionaries. After some conflict with head merc Lewis (Graham 
   McTavish), Rambo joins forces with the mercenaries (he's still mighty 
   handy with a bow!) to save the missionaries. The rest of the film is 
   non-stop carnage of the goriest kind and contains one of the best 
   bomb explosions I have ever seen as well as a final battle that will 
   have you on the edge of your seat repeating the phrase &quot;Holy 
   Shit!&quot; over and over.&nbsp; It's hard to believe Sylvester 
   Stallone had to fight for several years to get this film made on his 
   terms, but once you've seen it, you'll be glad that he fought a 
   winning battle. Stallone has turned in one of the hardest R-rated 
   action films in the history of American cinema. Nothing is left to 
   the imagination as bodies are blown apart, heads explode, limbs are 
   hacked off, people torn in half by gunfire and, in a scene that must 
   be seen to be believed, Rambo grabs a 50mm machine gun and pulverises 
   an enemy soldier's body until it is nothing but a bloody mist. 
   Stallone as Rambo is still a man of few words, but he's in excellent 
   shape for a man of 60+ years (thanks to his injections of human 
   growth hormones [HGH], which he swears by) and is still believable as 
   an action hero. The politics are pure 80's Reagan era, as the 
   holier-than-thou Christian doctor, Michael, chastises Rambo for his 
   violent ways (even threatening to turn Rambo in to authorities after 
   he kills four river pirates, who would have surely murdered him and 
   raped his girlfriend), only to take a life himself when he's pushed 
   to the point of no return in the nail-biting finale. Stallone also 
   pays tribute to the late Richard Crenna as Col. Trautman, using 
   scenes of him from the previous three Rambo films in a 
   black-and-white nightmare sequence, even using footage from the 
   alternate ending of <B><A HREF="first_blood_1982.htm">FIRST BLOOD</A></B> 
   (1982) where Trautman shoots and kills Rambo. There are also some 
   obvious uses of CGI (especially Tint's death), but most of it is very 
   quick and the explosion of the old WWII &quot;Tallboy&quot; bomb in 
   the forest is a thing of beauty and managed to jerk back the heads of 
   many audience members in a spectacular &quot;Holy Shit!&quot; moment. 
   Stallone is to be commended for making such a politically incorrect 
   action flick in a time where political correctness is akin to being a 
   &quot;patriot&quot;. This is Stallone's big &quot;Fuck You!!!&quot; 
   to all those who said he lost his chops (not to mention his mind) and 
   that ultra-violent action films were a thing of the past. After 
   viewing this film with a highly-appreciative audience, I implore my 
   readers to vote with your tickets as a way of telling studio 
   executives that we are tired of watered-down PG-13 rated crapfests 
   and want more of what <B><A HREF="rambo_2008b.htm">RAMBO</A></B> has 
   to offer: Balls-to-the-wall mindless carnage for no other reason then 
   to entertain us. We don't need &quot;message&quot; movies like Mel

   THE CHRIST</A></B> (2004) and <B><A HREF="apocalypto_2006.htm">APOCALYPTO</A></B>

   audience wanted and he delivered it in spades. Thank you! Also

   &quot;Extended Cut&quot;, where we see Rambo expose a bad guy's 
   collar bone and snap it in half with his bare hands. He also does the 
   same thing with the main bad guy Hugo Martinez's (Sergio 
   Peris-Mencheta) heart (after impaling him in the balls with an arrow, 
   using his trusty compound bow!), ripping it out of his chest and 
   crushing it with his bare hands, letting Hugo see it before he dies!

   After a few miles, he falls off, but before he dies, he tells a

   information. The C.I.A. then hires alcoholic mercenary Robert Burton 
   (Richard Harrison) to lead a rescue team and bring back an important 
   American P.O.W. that is being held at the prison. With the<A HREF="rescue_team_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rescue team french vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="125" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   promise of $100,000 for him and $50,000 for each team member, Burton 
   gets his old group together and plans for the mission, if going 
   bowling, visiting a strip club, screwing women and drinking 
   excessively is considered planning (one of the team members talks 
   about screwing his girlfriend, even though she's passed out, by 
   saying, &quot;She's good even when she's asleep!&quot;). They manage 
   to make it to Cambodia (disguised as archaeologists!) and set up camp 
   in the jungle. Burton manages to keep their official V.C. escort 
   occupied by teaching him how to swear in American (&quot;You can call 
   a woman a cunt, pussy or slit.&quot; is one exchange) until the 
   escort is killed in a surprise attack by jungle guerillas. The rescue 
   team then tranverse the jungle on their way to the P.O.W. camp, 
   avoiding booby traps, surprise attacks from the V.C. and other jungle 
   horrors. They meet their underground contact, Carla (Carol Roberts), 
   in the middle of the jungle and she guides them down the river until 
   they are ambushed and their boats and equipment are blown up. With no 
   weapons, the rescue team must find a way to make it through the 
   jungle in one piece and still meet their objective.&nbsp; While not 
   as delirious as some of the Indonesian action flicks (i.e. <B><A HREF="#Final Score">FINAL

   (also known as <B>OPERATION COLEMAN</B> [the last name of their

   for jungle traps and is then killed by a spiked booby trap, one team 
   member says, &quot;Well, there goes our mine sweeper!&quot; When they 
   finally raid the camp, it's rather sloppy as only one P.O.W.

   Harrison. I must raise my hand and admit I wrote the original 
   screenplay. I don't know if it came out as I conceived. It was a 
   straightforward script based on an abortive attempted rescue. I'm 
   quite unsympathetic about Harrison's complaints about having to 
   improvise scripts on the spot for the Z movies, where he appeared. In 
   Rescue Team, he had a completed one. I'm told he wouldn't let go of 
   it once he read it, but he had to rewrite it, not so much to improve 
   it, but to expand his part. K.Y. Lim was aiming for a better market, 
   but Harrison refused to play the role unless he was allowed to 
   rewrite it. When Mr. Lim asked my permission, I shrugged</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">.</FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B>

   graveyard, where Carruthers informs him that Zak was kidnapped by a 
   man named Petroli (D.W. Landingham), a Central American gun runner 
   that Steve pissed off (apparently in Part 1) and he kidnapped Zak in 
   retaliation. Carruthers wants Steve to go on one last mission to 
   bring Petroli down, but Steve passes and plans on getting Petroli his 
   own way. Steve contacts female operative Teri Anderson (Lynn 
   O'Brien), who finds out that Zak is actually being held by 
   Carruthers, who is working with Petroli, smuggling drugs into the 
   country. Teri rescues Zak and brings him to Steve. Steve then goes to 
   Petroli's headquarters and steals a van containing the latest 
   shipment of drugs and Carruthers' dirty money. Now, Carruthers wants 
   Petroli and Steve dead, Petroli wants Steve and Carruthers dead and 
   Steve wants Carruthers and Petroli dead. Steve turns the tables on 
   everyone when he takes over Petroli's warehouse, boobytraps it with 
   explosives and then blows up all the drugs while wiping out all of

   including plenty of bullet squibs, explosions and car chases. Ron

    place in some alternate universe). The film opens with Kohar (W.D. 
   Mochtar) and his gang trying to forcibly take a magical red stone 
   necklace from the neck of a white-robed sorcerer. After either 
   shooting, stabbing or blowing-up all the sorcerer's men, Kohar shoots 
   the sorcerer with his special rifle and the sorcerer disappears in a 
   puff of smoke, leaving the necklace on the ground. The necklace turns 
   out to be a fake (the real necklace will turn water red when 
   submerged, but it's power is never really explained), as Kohar 
   regrettably finds out when he hands it to his boss (who is also a 
   sorcerer). The white-robed sorcerer appears bathed in a glow of red 
   light in front of Maya (Dana Christina), after saving her from an 
   attack by some of Kohar's men (and one high-kicking woman). He gives 
   her the real necklace and tells her to protect it with her life. Maya 
   doesn't want to wear the necklace, so the sorcerer trashes her 
   apartment (!) until she agrees to wear it. Maya begins acting strange 
   (she gains fighting ability and magical powers), which worries her 
   boyfriend Ricky (Barry Prima). Ricky takes her to a medicine man (She 
   says, &quot;I don't believe in mumbo-jumbo!&quot;) to help her with 
   her problems. The medicine man (who has a hunchback assistant) turns 
   out to be Kohar's boss. He hypnotizes Maya, while Kohar and his men 
   search her apartment for the necklace (for some reason, she still 
   doesn't like to put it around her neck!). They are interrupted in 
   their search by a mysterious man in black (Advent Bangun, the closest 
   thing to a ninja in this film), who beats the shit out of all of 
   them. Meanwhile, Maya becomes possessed by the sorcerer and destroys 
   the evil medicine man's home (rather than leave through the door, she 
   kicks a hole in the wall!). The sorcerer reveals himself to Ricky and 
   explains what is going on (I wish he would explain it to me!) and 
   even imbues Ricky with some magical powers. The evil medicine man 
   frees a witch in exchange to locate the body a even more evil 
   sorcerer, who he plans on using to kill the good sorcerer and then 
   gain control of the necklace. After performing a ceremony involving a 
   freshly removed beating human heart, they locate the body. Now it 
   becomes really confusing. Ricky fights the man in black and he beats 
   the possessed spirit out of Ricky. The reanimated evil sorcerer and 
   his undead zombie army fight the good sorcerer, Maya, Ricky and the 
   man in black for possession of the necklace.

    people win in the end, at least I hope so!&nbsp; I'm still trying to 
   figure out just what the hell I watched here. Filled with nonsensical 
   scenes, like the one at a disco where the dancers on stage swing 
   their hips while the one in the middle turns a huge ship's steering 
   helm (!) or the scene where the man in black outraces a speeding car 
   on foot, jumps on the roof and rides it like a surfboard. He then 
   puches a hole in the roof with his bare hands, killing the driver and 
   forcing the car to crash and explode. He also kicks the hunchback so 
   hard, he stands up straight (the look on the hunchback's face is 
   priceless!). He then stomps on the poor man's hump, crushing it. 
   Director Ratno Timoer (<B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Devil'sSword">THE 
   DEVIL'S SWORD</A></B> - 1984) lays on the supernatural elements 
   pretty thick, as objects float in the air, the flames on candles 
   erupt like flamethrowers and, at one point, when Maya becomes 
   possessed, she looks like Linda Blair in <B><A HREF="exorcist.htm">THE

   disembowelment, an army of fast-moving zombies and Barry Prima (doing 
   his best Chuck Norris impression) jumping through the windshield of 
   Kohar's moving car, killing both Kohar and his boss. It also has the 
   man in black swallowing the necklace, in one of the most &quot;What 
   The Fuck?!?&quot; moments in Indonesian film history. There's also 
   some choice dialogue, such as when one of Kohar's assassins says, 
   &quot;I'll blow his brains out if I can find them!&quot;. All-in-all, <B><A HREF="revenge_of_ninja_1984c.htm">REVENGE

   on, only he tells the Police Inspector (Marc Mazza; <B><A HREF="my_name_is_nobody_1973.htm">MY

   quarreled and Harmakolis fired him. The Inspector tells Al that Jean 
   Daniel threatened Harmakolis and told him he would pay for what he 
   did. The Inspector then hits Al with a surprise revelation: Jean 
   Daniel was killed on the motorcycle when it was hit by a train, 
   taking Al to the morgue to identify Jean Daniel's twisted and bloody 
   corpse, which he does. The Inspector then tells Al that the inquest 
   into Harmakolis' murder is officially over, but I think we all know 
   by now it is anything but (The Inspector says it is just as well the 
   case is closed, because the inquest and Jean Daniel's trial would 
   have triggered off no end or arguments and accusations. If Al didn't 
   make this identification, the police force might have suspected 
   someone else, which would have been Al.). So who really killed 
   Harmakolis and why?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see Vito Cipriani (Oliver Reed; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Maniac! 1976">MANIAC!</A></B> 
   - 1977) and his new wife Anna (Agostina Belli; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightOfThe Devils72">NIGHT
    OF THE DEVILS</A></B> - 1972) return to Milan from their honeymoon 
   and about to make love&nbsp; (all we see are Anna's bare feet on top 
   of Vito's shoes as he walks to the bedroom and for every step he 
   takes, a piece of Anna's clothing falls to the floor). We then see 
   gangster Michel Granier (Frederic de Pasquale; <B><A HREF="french_connection_1971.htm">THE
    FRENCH CONNECTION</A></B> - 1971) getting off a plane in Milan and 
   two greasy-looking thugs getting off a train in the same location. Is 
   this all connected in some way? Count on it. Vito gets a phone call 
   and has to leave, disappointing Anna because she wanted to go 
   shopping with her new husband, but he promises that when he returns 
   they will go shopping together. We then discover that Vito is a 
   warden of a Milan prison and we watch him diffuse a situation at the 
   prison hospital where a suicidal prisoner (Sal Borgese; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Tormentor1972">TORMENTOR</A></B> 
   - 1972) threatens to kill himself with a knife (Vito asks the inmate: 
   &quot;Are you Japanese? Only the Japanese know how to kill themselves 
   with a knife.&quot; and he pulls the knife out of the inmate's 
   hands). When Vito gets home, he calls out for Anna, but she doesn't 
   answer. The phone then rings and the man on the other end tells Vito 
   that he has kidnapped Anna and if he ever wants to see her alive 
   again, he must release an inmate that is in his prison. The inmate's 
   name is Milo Ruiz and he even gives Vito Milo's block number and 
   prisoner number, finishing with, &quot;Find a way to spring him or 
   we'll fix your wife so you wouldn't recognize her!&quot; Vito does 
   some background research on Milo and discovers that he deserted from 
   the Foreign Legion and is in prison for attempted robbery. He 
   confronts Milo in his cell alone and demands to know who his friends 
   are and why they want him released. Milo plays ignorant (or maybe he 
   isn't playing), saying he has no idea because he has no friends, his 
   only friend died a short while ago. Vito then questions Milo's 
   cellmate and he tells him the only name Milo ever mentioned was a man 
   named Grappa (<A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_2.htm#PeterBerling">Peter
    Berling</A>; <B><A HREF="#Manhunt1972">MANHUNT</A></B> - 1972), who 
   Vito goes to see and gets a little bit of information that helps him. 
   We then discover that the men holding Anna are the two men we saw get 
   off the train. They call Vito again and to show they mean business, 
   they make him listen while they slap Anna around. Vito tells them if 
   they hurt his wife, he won't go to the police, he'll hunt them down 
   and kill them.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Vito then has Milo brought to his office and punches him silly, 
   telling him that when he goes to the prison hospital, he will make it 
   easy for him to escape, only when Milo escapes, Vito takes him 
   prisoner at gunpoint and tells Milo that if he wants to live, he 
   better call his friends and he will make a trade with them, him for 
   his wife, but Milo still says he doesn't know what he is talking 
   about, he doesn't have any idea who these friends are, he buried his 
   only friend a couple of months ago. So begins this uneasy partner 
   ship, full of double and triple crosses, as Vito searches for his 
   wife while Milo tries to figure out who wants him released and why. 
   But the real question still remains this: Is Milo playing stupid or 
   does he really not know who kidnapped Vito's wife?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    What the kidnappers don't count on is Vito being so stubborn and 
   unrelenting, not playing by the &quot;rules&quot;. He refuses to turn 
   Milo over to the kidnappers until he has Anna safely back in his arms 
   and learns that the kidnappers are getting instructions from someone 
   else. The Inspector tries to help Vito by following the kidnappers 
   (telling Vito it feels good being a cop again), but he pays for it 
   with his life (they run them over with their car and pose the body 
   for Vito to find). The kidnapper's boss, Michel Granier, grows tired 
   of the kidnappers' brutal ways and &quot;fires&quot; them, taking 
   possession of Anna. Vito inches closer and closer to Anna, leading 
   him to a Frenchman named Joe Lacours (Steffen Zaccarias; <B><A HREF="they_call_me_trinity_1970.htm">THEY
    CALL ME TRINITY</A></B> - 1970), who hands Vito a magazine with a 
   photo of Al Niko on the cover, Milo knocks out Vito and Joe tells him 
   he must kill him, he knows too much, but Milo is no killer and 
   refuses to do it (even when the hard-headed Vito taunts him to do 
   it!). As Milo holds a gun to Vito, he says, &quot;You're just like 
   those stupid bigots who think the confessional is the key to 
   goodness. For six days they sin and then get absolved on the 
   seventh.&quot; (Truer words were never spoken). He can't bring 
   himself to kill Vito because he never killed anyone in his entire 
   life, so he works with him instead, helping him uncover the truth. 
   While Vito was knocked out, Joe told Milo that Anna is in Paris with

   Vito and Milo meet while searching for Anna, including Carlotta 
   (Paola Pitgora; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#PsychoutMurder1969">PSYCHOUT 
   FOR MURDER</A></B> - 1969), who smuggles people across the French 
   border and Al Niko, who we see filming an early music video 
   (pre-dating MTV by nearly ten years), whom we discover is one of 
   Milo's friends. Then things get very strange. We discover that the 
   friend Milo buried in the beginning of the film was actually Jean 
   Daniel Ogeire, so who was the body that Al identified as Jean Daniel 
   in the morgue? It turns out that Al is not only a famous pop star, he 
   runs another nefarious and highly illegal business on the side, 
   giving his &quot;groupies&quot; something to seriously worry about. 
   But the best aspect of this film is the relationship that develops 
   between Vito and Milo. It first starts out as a relationship of 
   mistrust, but slowly becomes one of mutual respect and they begin to 
   depend on each other (Milo also does a trick with a smoked cigarette 
   butt that I have never seen done before!). There's also one final 
   twist that I never saw coming, making this film a treat for lovers of 
   the EuroCrime genre.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   (1983) -</B> This charming bit of Italian action sleaze tells the 
   story of mercenary-turned-commercial pilot Rolf (Tony Marsina), who 
   is trying to put his past behind him, but circumstances won't let 
   him. A flashback reveals that the local police refuse to believe he 
   has changed his ways, so he is arrested and one of the cops shoves 
   his hand into a shit-filled toilet, wipes his hand on a wall and then 
   makes a remark to Rolf that he now won't have to be fingerprinted! 
   When a member of his former mercenary squad offers him $50,000 to fly 
   drugs out of the country, he refuses, which upsets his girlfriend 
   Joanna (Ketty Nicols). Rolf explains to her the reason he turned it 
   down was because when he was a kid he saw his prostitute mother die 
   of a hot shot administered by her pimp when she refused to trick for 
   him anymore (in another one of the film's many flashbacks). When 
   Rolf's entire former squad show up and beat the shit out of him and 
   then tell him if he won't fly for them, he'll fly for no one, a 
   battered Rolf passes out in the woods (they dislocate his knee, which 
   he painfully resets himself), where insects and leeches attack his<A HREF="rolf_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rolf poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   body (!) A worried Joanna reports him missing to the police, but they 
   refuse to look for him, so she goes looking for Rolf herself (after 
   nearly being raped by two thugs!) and finds him in the woods! After 
   finding out the next day that he's been fired from his job (Rolf: 
   &quot;Why can't I fly for you anymore?&quot; Boss: &quot;Let's just 
   say I don't like your face!&quot;), Rolf puts two-and-two together, 
   hijacks the plane with the shipment of drugs, pisses on them (!) and 
   tosses the drugs out of the plane. His former buddies don't take too 
   kindly to it, so they kidnap Joanna, make her strip in front of them 
   and take turns raping her. After they are done with her, they shoot 
   Joanna &quot;dead center in the heart&quot; (according to a cop at 
   the crime scene). When Rolf finds out about his girlfriend's brutal 
   gang rape and murder, he sends a message to his former buddies to 
   meet them in the forest, where the film turns into a <B><A HREF="first_blood_1982.htm">FIRST
    BLOOD</A></B> clone (with Italian sensibilities). Rolf goes Rambo on 
   his former crew, hunting them down one-by-one, using spiked 
   boobytraps (are there any other kind?), explosions, gunfire and 
   hand-to-hand combat to achieve his retribution. When one of the 
   mercenaries escapes, Rolf must stay one step ahead of the police in 
   order to hunt down and kill his last nemesis.&nbsp; As you can tell 
   by my description, this action flick lacks logic of any kind, but 
   that's where this film's strength lies. Just when you think you've 
   seen it all, this film throws another head-scratching scene in your 
   direction. I was in hysterics when one of Rolf's former buddies 
   tortures another pilot (who was with Rolf when he hijacked the drug 
   plane), throwing boiling soup in his face, sticking his head into the 
   open flame on the stove and then shooting him in the head when he 
   refuses to give up Rolf's location. A couple of minutes later, as he 
   is walking out of the dead guy's apartment, the former buddy is 
   delivered a message telling him where to meet Rolf! Talk about bad 
   timing. Director/scripter Mario Siciliano (<B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#EvilEye1975">EVIL

   1978), using his frequent pseudonym &quot;Marlon Sirko&quot; (all 
   other credits on the film are also Anglicized), doesn't offer much in 
   the way of heady dialogue (It doesn't get more thought-provoking 
   than, &quot;Shut up, you bag of shit!&quot;), but the film is bloody 
   as hell and a wild ride until the final third, when it turns into a <B>FIRST
    BLOOD</B> rip-off. Still, it's an amazing Rambo clone, with 
   impalements, exploding bodies and Rolf screaming, &quot;God, help 
   me!&quot; after being shot in the hands. Whoever was in charge of the 
   dubbing has a hard time deciding whether the title character's name 
   is &quot;Rolf&quot; or &quot;Ralph&quot;. There's also an amazing 
   flashback scene towards the finale showing Rolf's mercenary squad (in 
   their final mission together) shooting up an African village full of 
   innocent women and children. What's truly remarkable about it is when 
   they throw one African boy up in the air and shoot him like skeet 
   over and over! Rolf, of course, is appalled and manages to save some 
   of the other children. I also love how, for an action hero, Rolf 
   spends a good portion of his screen time crying, either over the loss 
   of a loved one or in pain. He even carries a photo of his dead hooker 
   mother in his wallet and cries when he looks at it! This is classic 
   Italian nonsense and worth searching out. The lyrics of the cheesy 
   title tune (sung by Chris J. King), goes, &quot;Rolf, you've run out 
   of luck. Rolf, you've taken the road that leads to pain...&quot; Days 
   later, I was still humming it! Also starring Tony Roccosta, Malcolm

   This is an excellent example of &quot;Poliziotteschi&quot; or Italian 
   &quot;Tough Cop&quot; film. Maurizio Merli stars as no-nonsense 
   Inspector Tanzi, who is tired of arresting people and them having 
   them go free due to Article 20 (a big problem in Italy at the time). 
   After he arrests crook Savelli (Biagi Pelligra) at an illegal 
   gambling operation, Tanzi is forced to set him free for lack of 
   evidence, only to have Savelli kill a bank guard during a robbery the 
   next day. Complicating matters is <A HREF="rome_armed_to_the_teeth_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rome armed to the teeth dvd front small2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="162" HEIGHT="226" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>Tanzi's
    court psychiatrist girlfriend, Anna (Maria Rosaria Omaggio). After 
   he arrests two teens for stealing a purse, she sets them free rather 
   than sending them to a reformatory. They end up getting killed the 
   next day when their scooter jumps a curb after they steal another 
   purse. Tanzi wants to create a special squad that deals with 
   criminals on their own terms, but his boss, Ruini (Arthur Kennedy), 
   refuses, so Tanzi and his partner, Inspector Caputo (Gian piero 
   Albertini), go out and look for Savelli on their own and break every 
   rule in the book. They start with one of Savelli's friends, a 
   hunchback butcher named Vincenzo Moretto (the crazy Tomas Milian). 
   When Moretto refuses to talk, even after Tanzi kicks him square in 
   the nuts (Moretto says, &quot;If you was kicked in the balls, you'd 
   hurt too!&quot; when Caputo asks why he is crying.), Tanzi plants 
   drugs on him and brings the hunchback to the station, where Tanzi and 
   Caputo work him over pretty good. Moretto tries to slit his wrists in 
   the station's bathroom, so Ruini demotes Tanzi (He screams to Tanzi, 
   &quot;Can you see tomorrow's headline: Hunchback Battered By Vicious 
   Cop!&quot;). Savelli kidnaps Anna and brings her to an auto junkyard, 
   where they rough her up and threaten to crush her in a junked car. 
   They set her free after giving her a single bullet to give to Tanzi 
   as a warning. Tanzi is forced to work in the Licencing Bureau issuing 
   permits, but during his lunch breaks and evenings he searches for 
   Savelli (He visits Moretto at his house during dinner and forces him 
   to swallow the bullet that Savelli gave Anna.). After killing a kid 
   who was involved in a brutal gang rape (The kid says to the victim, 
   &quot;We're gonna ball you till you die!&quot; and then sodomizes her 
   with a piece of wood), Tanzi finally gets the chance to confront 
   heroin dealer Tony Parenzo (Ivan Rassimov), Tanzi's oldest nemesis 
   and best friend of Savelli. When Moretto shoots Parenzo and frames 
   Tanzi for it, Tanzi offers his resignation to Ruini, but a hostage 
   situation at a bank involving Savelli offers Tanzi a chance at 
   redemption.&nbsp; While the narrative structure of this film is all

   (1975), does a good job of displaying Tanzi's justified rage at a 
   legal system that favors the criminals over the victims. Time after 
   time, we witness the criminals getting off easy (or suffering no 
   consequences at all) for their crimes, including murder. If it 
   weren't for Tanzi, most of these crooks would get off scott-free. One 
   still has to wonder if Tanzi's brutal tactics are responsible for 
   hunchback Moretto's later crimes in the film (You've got to hear his 
   story about crapping out the bullet that Tanzi made him swallow!), as 
   he was pretty rough on Moretto, trying to beat information out of him 
   that he never really had in the first place. Tomas Milian (<B><A HREF="#Almost Human">ALMOST
    HUMAN</A></B>) is an absolute riot as Moretto. He is given the best 
   lines and his sudden change from helpless victim to bloodthirsty 
   murderer is simply amazing. I especially liked the scene where he 
   shoots a guy for not touching his hump for luck (&quot;I bet you wish 
   you touched it now!&quot;) and when he hijacks an ambulance (He asks 
   a guy in the back where he is going. Before he has a chance to 
   answer, Moretto shoots him with a machine gun and says, &quot;You're 
   going to the graveyard, that's where!). Maurizio Merli is the king of

   tournament, where Jag fights a hulking masked mutant with a chainsaw 
   (the blade of the chainsaw never spins, yet the over-amped sound 
   effects wants you to believe otherwise). After defeating the mutant, 
   Jag and the girls make it to Paradise City (but we don't get to see 
   it) and the Warden is left to stew in his own juices.&nbsp; There's a 
   good reason why this &quot;film&quot; wasn't released until now. By 
   the looks of what my eyes have just witnessed, <B>RUN LIKE HELL</B> 
   looks to be an unfinished film or, at least, a film made by someone 
   without even basic filmmaking knowledge. Director Eric Brummer 
   (better known as porno director &quot;Slain Wayne&quot;; <B><A HREF="terrors_from_the_clit_2_2000.htm">TERRORS
    FROM THE CLIT</A></B> - 2000; <B><A HREF="kung_fu_girls_2001.htm">KUNG
    FU GIRLS</A></B> - 2001) can't be bothered with simple things like 
   continuity, as scenes begin and end with little or no rhyme or reason 
   (the shooting death of the first escaped prisoner is particularly 
   confusing) and the screenplay, by Rundle, Steven Stein and Alan Hall, 
   introduces too many characters and sub-plots to sustain interest (A 
   sub-plot involving a bounty tracker named John Steele rescuing a 
   woman from prison ends unceremoniously when they are both shot dead 
   in the desert). While this film has plenty of topless female nudity, 
   the overall cheapness of the production, with it's flat, 
   shot-on-video camerawork, hopeless acting ability of the cast (all 
   Z'Dar does is slap a baton repeatedly in his palm and leer at the 
   topless women on his TV monitors like some masturbatory loon) and 
   lame-ass action sequences (badly-staged and choreographed martial 
   arts and gun fights), makes me wonder if this &quot;film&quot; should 
   have ever seen the light of day. Some movies go unreleased for a 
   reason. Run like hell from <B>RUN LIKE HELL</B> unless you want to 
   experience the filmic equivalent of having bamboo chutes shoved under 
   your fingernails. Also starring Dree Lang, Colleen Corrigan, Liz 
   Davies and Elizabeth Prince as the four escapees and featuring

    and his men not only contend with a serial killer dubbed the 
   &quot;Hollowpoint Killer&quot; by the press (due to the type of 
   bullet the killer uses), they also have to constantly keep the peace 
   between the American occupation and the locals who resent their 
   presence. Tensions are so bad, some locals slit the throat of Sgt. 
   Tim Bryant's (John Allen Nelson; <B><A HREF="killer_klowns_outer_space_1988.htm">KILLER
    KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE</A></B> - 1988) Vietnamese girlfriend while

   (P.J. Soles; <B><A HREF="halloween_1978.htm">HALLOWEEN</A></B> - 
   1978), who is assigned to ride along with Sgt. Stryker, only makes 
   his job more difficult. When the Hollowpoint Killer, who has murdered 
   ten Vietnamese locals, kills his first American victim, the pressure 
   is put on Sgt. Stryker to find him and find him fast. Complicating 
   matters is when Tim, who is grieving the loss of his girlfriend, 
   turns rogue and begins murdering locals in retribution. Not anonymous 
   locals, mind you, but prominent, influential locals. Sgt. Stryker, 
   who had an opportunity to bring Tim in, but let his personal 
   friendship with him get in the way, is framed by Col. Tranh (Joe Mari 
   Avellana) for the death of Stryker's commanding officer (Frederick 
   Bailey). When a lynch mob of locals try to grab Stryker as he is 
   taken into custody, he escapes with the help of Jean and some of his 
   MP buddies. He then sets out to clear his name, stop both Tim and the 
   Hollowpoint Killer and bring Col Tranh and his men down. To do that, 
   Stryker gathers all his Special Forces buddies together (he first has 
   to rescue them in the jungle while they are under heavy enemy fire) 
   and they then begin to lay waste to Saigon. When a nun and some 
   orphans are killed by a sniper, the locals blame Tim, but Stryker 
   knows better. The sniper is actually working for Col. Tranh, who is 
   also responsible for the Hollowpoint Killer. Col. Tranh hopes to get 
   the locals so riled up that they force all Americans out of Saigon. 
   The sniper then kills a bunch of Buddhists and tensions reach the 
   boiling point. When Jean is kidnapped, Stryker and his men swing into 
   action and save her. The finale takes place at an anti-American 
   rally, where Tim has the rally's leader, Nguyen HuuTri (Joonie 
   Gamboa), in his sights. Stryker must settle with Tim, the Hollowpoint 
   Killer and a corrupt political system all at the same time before the 
   film concludes.&nbsp; This is a halfway decent actioner that also<A HREF="saigon_commandos_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/saigon commandos dutch vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="232" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   attempts to address the difficulties the American occupation had to 
   endure while living amongst people quite different than us during a 
   time of war. While far from perfect (there's evidence of 
   post-production tampering by adding narration by Richard Young to 
   walk us through some scenes, which were probably never finished or 
   didn't contain enough footage to survive without an added 
   explanation), director Clark Henderson (who also gave us the god-awful
    <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#WarlordsFromHell">WARLORDS FROM HELL</A></B> 
   [1985] and the so-so <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#PrimaryTarget">PRIMARY
    TARGET</A></B> [1988]) at least tries to deliver something 
   different, mixing action, mystery, political intrigue, corruption and 
   racial tensions into a heady little brew. You've got to admire a film 
   that opens with a Vietnamese rock band (actually Filipino group 
   &quot;The Eurasia Band&quot;) grooving to &quot;House Of The Rising 
   Sun&quot; and &quot;Midnight Special&quot; while a group of American 
   GIs (led by Nick Nicholson) and Vietnamese locals face-off in a bar. 
   The script, by Thomas McKelvey Cleaver (<B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Sisterhood1987">THE
    SISTERHOOD</A></B> - 1987; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#TerrorWithin">THE
    TERROR WITHIN</A></B> - 1988), is much more political than most 
   films in this genre and the backdrop of cultural differences does 
   manage to generate some genuine suspense. <B><A HREF="saigon_commandos_1987c.htm">SAIGON
    COMMANDOS</A></B> also tries to play fair with both sides of the 
   political coin. Scripter Cleaver portrays the occupying American 
   forces and the native Vietnamese as flawed human beings with passions 
   that turn out tragically for both sides. Sure, there are villians 
   here, but most of them pay for their sins with their lives. Tim's 
   death is probably the film's most dramatic, kind of what law 
   enforcement calls &quot;death by cop&quot;, where Tim leaves his 
   buddies no choice but to kill him, even though his sniper rifle is 
   out of ammunition. To Tim, this is a hero's death. He would rather 
   his friends kill him then spend the rest of his life in prison. 
   Director Henderson fills the film with plenty of bloody bullet squibs 
   (including scenes of children getting killed), explosions, chases and 
   nudity, so action fans will not be disappointed, but this film has 
   loftier ambitions than a straight-ahead action flick. Give it a try. 
   If I didn't know better, I would say that Filipino director/producer 
   Cirio H. Santiago had a hand in this (it's full of his people, both 
   in front and behind the camera), but his name is nowhere to be found 
   in the credits. Also starring Jim B. Jr., Spanky Manikan, Willie

    and recapture her again! Mongo tries to kill her with the spiked 
   headband, but she escapes again, by walking on top of the heads of 
   Mongo and his gang (as she runs away, she turns around to face Mongo, 
   grabs her crotch and yells out &quot;Hey! Hey! Hey!&quot; like Fat 
   Albert!). She steals a police car, runs down a few of the gang and 
   then decides she's had enough. Suddenly, she turns into a one-woman 
   termination squad, fashioning weapons from farm tools, changing her 
   appearance from a schoolmarm to a sex vixen and killing nearly all of 
   Mongo's gang with various edged weapons and a whip! She kills Mongo, 
   steals all his drug money and walks off into the sunset. I guess she 
   deserved something for all her troubles.&nbsp; Where do I begin to 
   explain just how awful this film really is? First off, Debra Sweaney 
   as Susan is simply a horrible actress. She seems to think that she's 
   acting in a comedy and her line delivery, where she is always talking 
   to herself and smiling (even when she's being attacked) is annoying 
   and amateurish (Watch the scene where she jumps in the car with the 
   three horny teens and tell me that she isn't one of the worst 
   actresses of all time.) It's embarrassing to watch. Since this was 
   directed/produced/scripted by Patrick G. Donahue, who also gave us 
   the unbelievable <B><A HREF="kill_squad_1981.htm">KILL SQUAD</A></B> 
   (1981; his first and best film) and the so-bad-it's-good <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Parole Violators">PAROLE
    VIOLATORS</A></B> (1994), you know what to expect here: Action 
   sequences on a dime store budget (including an obvious junked car 
   being used in a crash gag), amateur actors (including Donahue's 
   brother, Sean Donahue, as Mongo's right-hand man Terk) and cheap, 
   unconvincing gore effects. The finale, where Susan takes on various 
   members of Mongo's gang with her homemade weapons is so badly done, 
   it's not even good for unintentional entertainment value. Her first 
   opponent is Chang (Steven Lee), who warns Susan that he has had 
   fifteen years of martial arts training. Susan then shoves a spike 
   into Chang's foot and says &quot;Ballet. Six months!&quot;&nbsp; She 
   then throws two giant nails into Chang's eyes and he is so dishonored 
   by her actions that he pounds the nails deeper into his skull until 
   they protrude out of the back of his head! The film's lame attempt at 
   humor comes when Susan shoves a twig in the ear of a black gang 
   member who tries to rape her and he spends the rest of the film 
   saying &quot;What?&quot; every time some talks to him. Also, for a 
   film with so many attempted rapes (I think there were a total of 
   five), there is no nudity at all. That's like shooting yourself in 
   the foot, isn't it? Truly painful to watch, almost like a filmic 
   version of having a colonoscopy. Just like in Donahue's <B>KILL SQUAD</B>,
    the lead villain is decapitated by an axe in the finale. Please,

   Pretty good Canadian-made actioner. A crazed Vietnamese assassin 
   (Park Jong Soo) with a deformed hand begins killing American soldiers

   Falls and when Kip Moore (Perry King) is notified by Police Captain 
   Fusqua (George Kennedy) that his business partner (and fellow squad

   badly and hospitalized and Kip tells Captain Fusqua that the assassin 
   use to be part of his squad until they were ambushed and they were 
   forced to leave him behind. It looks like he has returned for some 
   payback. Fusqua and his men tail Kip in hopes of catching the 
   assassin in the act, but he is much too smart for that. Kip visits 
   Buddy in the hospital and learns that Buddy is going to be a 
   quadraplegic for the rest of his life. He begs Kip to kill him, but 
   Kip doesn't want to do it until Buddy has some time to think about 
   it. The assassin kidnaps Kip's girlfriend and leaves a note (as well 
   as a dead cop) for Kip to meet him alone and settle the score (When 
   one of Fusqua's men wants to set up a stakeout, Kip says, &quot;See 
   to your dead and leave me alone!&quot;). Kip gets ready for battle by 
   arming himself to the teeth. He manages to turn the tables and makes 
   the assassin the prey after rescuing his girlfriend. The final 
   battleground turns out to be a busy city block where innocent 
   pedestrians are killed before Kip and the assassin fight it out on 
   the rooftops and then in a wooded city park. The war is on!&nbsp;

   - 1982; and many others), this film is different from most action 
   films because it paints a sympathetic picture for both sides. Kip 
   just wants to forget about the war, but he knows it is impossible 
   (his dreams won't let him) and the assassin can't forget about it 
   until he gets total revenge on the soldiers responsible for leaving 
   him behind and letting the enemy torture him, his mangled hand a 
   constant reminder of the pain he endured. Fruet and screenwriter Don 
   Enright don't play favorites as can be seen in the scene where Kip 
   tries to explain the war to his girlfriend Kate (Tisa Farrow, who 
   made <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Zombie">ZOMBIE</A></B> a short time 
   later), which is intercut with the assassin looking at his war 
   scrapbook and praying to a photo of Jesus. The scene between Kip and 
   a paralyzed Buddy in the hospital is heart-wrenching and is another 
   unusual thing in a film like this (even though the paralysis angle is 
   never resolved). The Niagra Falls locations are used to good effect, 
   especially the Maid Of The Mist/power plant and city block/park 
   scenes. Although the film is rated PG, this is not kid's stuff. The

   In retaliation, there is another shootout at a restaurant, courtesy 
   of crimeboss Morgan (Gordon Mitchell), who is looking to take over

   tricks his house with pyrotechnics and special effects, including a 
   remote control pickup truck, which he uses to follow the thugs back

   whole new pickle. Mancini's men try to stop him from delivering Doris 
   to Morgan, using a rocket-firing helicopter, but Steve shoots it down 
   with a grenade launcher (in one of the film's cheesier effects). He 
   delivers Doris to Morgan, but Morgan refuses delivery because Doris 
   doesn't have the money she stole from him. Morgan gives Steve and 
   Doris three hours to return the money or Kate dies. They must now go 
   back to Mancini's house and steal the money. Stealing the money is 
   easy (maybe too easy) and Steve makes the trip back to Morgan, not

   shot and killed Doris for her treachery. This is not going to be a

   watch these films for his acting ability, do we? He makes a 
   serviceable action hero and I especially liked the scene where he 
   rescues his wife, they make love and she screams out 
   &quot;Action!&quot; just as she reaches climax (while a &quot;best 
   of&quot; compilation of Steve's best special effects explosions are 
   spliced-in to represent her pleasure!). Speaking of explosions, there 
   are plenty here, as we are shown Steve blowing up stuff in a film he 
   is working on (a Vietnam War film), his truck is tricked-out with 
   hidden machine guns and grenade launchers and he even blows up his 
   own house as a diversion for Morgan's men! There are also plenty of 
   gunfights, a real sappy song plays on the sountrack while Steve 
   searches for Doris (the lyrics repeat the phrase, &quot;Get my baby 
   back&quot; over and over), Gordon Mitchell has a role here that isn't 
   a glorified cameo (like most of his 80's roles) and most of the cast

   Fuck?!?&quot; moments to process in one viewing. The film opens with 
   a bar fight (what else?), where Danny Clarin (Max Laurel; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Robowar">ROBOWAR</A></B> 
   - 1988) tries to stop a drunk American from fondling a female dancer 
   on stage. This turns into a melee where Danny has to beat the crap 
   out of three guys (at one point, Danny and a brawny fighter get into 
   a ball-grabbing competition!). Immediately after the fight, Danny is 
   introduced to a military man and he instantly<A HREF="sgt_clarin_bullet_for_your_head_1990.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sgt. clarin bullet for your head philippines vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="154" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   joins the Marines! After a basic training montage (where Danny excels 
   at every task), the film switches to a bunch of guerilla rebels 
   holding an American soldier captive at their base camp (he has two 
   live grenades tied around his neck by a piece of twine while live 
   ants crawl all over his body!). The Marines lay siege to the rebels' 
   camp, with Danny blowing the crap out of anyone and anything in his 
   way, eventually rescuing the American soldier after cleaving the 
   rebel commander's head in two with a sword. After being wounded in 
   battle, Danny is promoted in rank to Sergeant and gets to lead his 
   own platoon. When Danny's brother is killed and his mother is put in 
   the hospital by the goons of a local crimelord, Danny asks for a 
   leave of absence from his superiors, but is turned down because they 
   are on &quot;triple red alert&quot;. Seeing that his mother is a 
   basketcase (she witnessed Danny's brother being viciously gunned 
   down), Danny goes AWOL to get his revenge. He is framed for the 
   assassination of the town's mayor, so Danny becomes a one-man hit 
   squad, killing all the crimelord's goons, by crossbow, gunfire and 
   even decapitation before he finally blasts the crimelord to kingdom 
   come. Danny then gets married to his childhood sweetheart Mary 
   (Monica Herrera) and talks his platoon into secretly helping him in 
   ridding the area of the rebels who have been raiding and murdering 
   the people of his and neighboring villages. When the rebels take 
   Danny's entire village hostage and demand that Danny give himself up 
   in trade (or they will kill a hostage every twenty minutes), he has 
   no choice but to turn himself over to the rebels. After being 
   brutally tortured, Danny is rescued by his platoon. They then steal 
   an APC and head towards the rebel's base camp, where Danny throws the 
   rebel leader in a water-filled cage, followed by a two-grenade 
   chaser. The finale finds Danny and his AWOL platoon making a decision 
   to surrender to the Marines. Danny, with the help of new wife Mary, 
   makes a deal to surrender, but a series of miscommunications and 
   unfortunate events leads to the death of Danny's entire platoon and 
   Danny himself (while clutching a baby, no less!) by the Marines. Mary 
   arrives just in time to hear Danny sa<A HREF="sgt_clarin_bullet_for_your_head_1990b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sgt. clarin bullet for your head japanese vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="136" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>y,
    &quot;I love you!&quot; one more time before he croaks. Cue the 
   angelic choir (literally).&nbsp; This off-the-wall Filipino actioner 
   is nothing more than one bloody vignette after another. Every 15 
   minutes or so, the film switches to a new storyline (some plot 
   points, like the search for hidden gold, are completely dropped 
   without ever being resolved) and a different direction, the only 
   connecting link being Danny and his need to kill someone or blow 
   something apart. The film is bloody as hell, as people are shot in 
   the head, riddled with bullets, stabbed, impaled (one poor rebel is 
   impaled on a long pole and dragged across the ground by Danny) and 
   decapitated (there is a lot of violence to people's heads here). The 
   English dubbing is truly atrocious, the funniest example being that 
   the dubbers changed Danny's last name from &quot;Clarin&quot; to 
   &quot;Clark&quot;, totally ignoring the title of the film! This film 
   also has a slight religious subtext to it, as there is a lot of talk 
   of Heaven, Hell and having faith in God, but actor-turned-director 
   Willie Dado (this is his only directorial effort), working with a 
   script by Leleng Ubaldo Jr., has no problem showing scenes of bloody 
   torture (Danny is sliced repeatedly with a knife and then thrown into 
   a stagnant, water-filled cage), horrendous deaths or having a bad guy 
   press a gun to a baby's head. This mindless, gory actioner is a treat 
   for fans of Filipino action cinema and gets my highest 
   recommendation. Grab it if you're lucky enough to locate a copy. If 
   star Max Laurel looks familiar to Filipino movie fans, it's probably 
   because he essayed the title role in <B><A HREF="zuma_1985.htm">ZUMA</A></B>

    The film opens with the deaths of three high-ranking military 
   officials, all of them cold-blooded murders, but staged to look like 
   accidents or suicides. The first to die is Major Antonio Lorusso 
   (actor unknown), who has the brakes on his car tampered with causing 
   his car to roll several times and crash into a tree (stylishly done) 
   when he tries to avoid a collision with a truck. The next to die is 
   Colonel Giulio Scanni (cameo king Tom Felleghy; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DamnedInVenice1978">DAMNED
    IN VENICE</A></B> - 1978), who is knocked-out by two thugs, placed 
   in his office chair, has a gun put in his hand and pulls the trigger, 
   shooting him in the head and making it look like a suicide. General 
   Eugenio Stocchi (Giovanni Di Benedetto; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#NakedYouDie">NAKED
    YOU DIE</A></B> - 1968) is the next victim, as we watch three goons 
   place his unconscious body on railroad tracks, where an oncoming 
   train runs him over, cutting off his head (His decapitated head flies 
   directly into the camera, spraying blood all over the lens. I wonder 
   how many times it took to achieve this bloody effect, since it was 
   much too early for CGI?).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Police Inspector Giorgio Solmi (Luc Merenda; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#KidnapSyndicate">KIDNAP
    SYNDICATE</A></B> - 1975) and his assistant, Lt. Luigi Caprara 
   (Michele Gammino; <B><A HREF="confessions_of_a_police_captain_1971.htm">CONFESSIONS
    OF A POLICE CAPTAIN</A></B> - 1971), arrive at the house of a murder 
   victim, an electrician named Salvatore Chiarotti (Giancarlo Badessi; <B><A HREF="how_to_kill_a_judge_1974.htm">HOW
    TO KILL A JUDGE</A></B> - 1974), who had his head caved in with 
   three swings of a fireplace poker and there's a bunch of 10,000 lire 
   bills and bank wrappers scattered on the floor. Solmi wonders how a 
   simple electrician could afford such an expensive, elegant home in a 
   gated community. Then District Attorney Mannino (Mel Ferrer; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EatenAlive1980">EATEN
    ALIVE!</A></B> - 1980) arrives at the crime scene. A new law was 
   recently passed that put the D.A.'s office in charge of homicides and 
   when they learn from the community's guard that Chiarotti had a 
   female visitor last night around midnight, Mannino tells Solmi to 
   find her. Solmi is a damn good investigator, who discovers that 
   Chiarotti was not just an electrician, he was also a private 
   investigator. Solmi also deduces that Chiarotti's midnight female 
   visitor was a prostitute, leading him and Luigi to a whorehouse run 
   by Baronessa Grimani (Clara Colosimo; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#VampireInVenice1988">VAMPIRE
    IN VENICE</A></B> - 1988), who acts all cultured and proper until 
   Solmi threatens to send her to prison for using underage girls; then 
   she begins swearing like a truck driver (It's quite funny). Under 
   pressure from Solmi and Luigi, the Baronessa tells them that the 
   prostitute's name that visited Chiarotti is Giuliana Raimondi, a.k.a. 
   &quot;La Tunisina&quot; (&quot;The Tunisian&quot;), giving Solmi her 
   address. When Solmi and Luigi arrive at Giuliana's apartment, Solmi 
   catches a whiff of gas, but he is unable to stop Luigi from ringing 
   the doorbell in time, which results in the door blowing off its 
   hinges. Luckily, Solmi and Luigi escape harm and when they enter the 
   apartment, they find Giuliana (Paola Tedesco; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WatchMeKill1977">WATCH
    ME WHEN I KILL</A></B> - 1977) unconscious on the floor, her wrists 
   cut in an apparent suicide. They also discover an open dresser drawer 
   full of 10,000 lire bills. Solmi is able to save Giuliana's life and 
   at the hospital D.A. Mannino orders Solmi to arrest Giuliana for 
   murder; as far as he's concerned, the case is closed. Solmi has 
   another opinion, thinking that it is all just a little too pat; it is 
   obvious that Giuliana is being set up and couldn't possibly be the 
   murderer, because a woman her size couldn't possibly cave a man's 
   head in with three swings of a fireplace poker. Giuliana tells Solmi 
   she didn't try to commit suicide, saying someone entered her 
   apartment, knocked her out, slit her wrists and put money in her 
   dresser drawer to make her look like the murderer. She says she saw 
   the man who killed Chiarotti (he is a paid assassin known on the 
   street as &quot;Massu&quot; [Antonio Casale; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Autopsy1973">AUTOPSY</A></B> 
   - 1973]) and saw him take a bag full of money (Shown in flashback, 
   Massu chasing Giuliana out of the house and firing his 
   silencer-equipped pistol at her, but she managed to escape in her 
   car). Mannino doesn't believe Giuliana, but Solmi does, proving his 
   theory at a restaurant with part-time girlfriend Maria (Delia 
   Boccardo; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Shoot1stDieLate1974">SHOOT 
   FIRST, DIE LATER</A></B> - 1974, also with Merenda), a newspaper 
   reporter working on the story of the military officials' deaths. He 
   has Maria take three swings at a squash with a cricket bat, but she 
   is unable to break it open. Solmi does with just one swing.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Solmi is sure there is more to the story, so he has Luigi and 
   Detective Luca (Gianfranco Barra; <B><A HREF="#ExecutionSquad1972">EXECUTION
    SQUAD</A></B> - 1972) stakeout Chiarotti's house and they discover a 
   man using a key to open the front door and enter a secret room in the 
   house, which is full of recording equipment. He takes a reel of 
   audiotape and Luigi and Luca arrest him (after a short fight), taking 
   him to police headquarters, where Solmi questions him. The man says 
   he is a law enforcement official named Remo Ortolani (Carlo 
   Alighiero; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CatONineTails1971">THE CAT O' 
   NINE TAILS</A></B> - 1971), who works for the Special Information 
   Branch, headed by Captain Mario Sperli (Tomas Milian; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#SyndicateSadists75">SYNDICATE
    SADISTS</A></B> - 1975), showing Solmi his badge and credentials. 
   Solmi is certain he is lying and pays Captain Sperli a visit, where 
   he tells Solmi the man is lying, his credentials are an obvious 
   forgery. Captain Sperli wants to talk to Remo and Solmi agrees, but 
   he believes Sperli is not telling him the whole truth. Maybe the reel 
   of audiotape Remo stole holds clues to Chiarotti's murder? Solmi, who 
   previously listened to the tape (It contained General Stocchi giving 
   a man named Rienzi a list or coordinates and telling him to put 
   &quot;Operation Alpha 3&quot; into effect), sent it to the D.A.'s 
   office as evidence, but when he tries to listen to it again, it is 
   blank, as if it were magnetically erased. D.A. Mannino doesn't take 
   Solmi's accusation that he or someone in his office erased the tape 
   too kindly, saying it could have easily been done by someone in 
   Solmi's department, that is if there was anything on the tape to 
   begin with. The bigger question is this: What does all this have to 
   do with the deaths of the military personnel?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Captain Sperli talks to Remo in prison with Solmi in the room and 
   Remo says he wasn't trying to steal any particular tape, but any reel 
   he could get his hands on. He knew Chiarotti because they were both 
   in the same &quot;business&quot; together. He was hoping to get some 
   dirt on whoever was on the tape and blackmail them to make some easy 
   money. Captain Sperli tells Solmi that his agency is investigating 
   General Stocchi's &quot;suicide' and praises Solmi to D.A. Mannino, 
   but in the same breath says he wants Solmi to turn over all his files 
   on this case because it involves the General and Mannino agrees, 
   making Solmi very unhappy.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Solmi and Luigi continue their investigation by questioning the wife 
   of oil millionaire Mr. Martinetti (Claudio Gora; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SevenBloodOrchids72">SEVEN
    BLOOD-STAINED ORCHIDS</A></B> - 1972), whose name was in Chiarotti's 
   address book. It turns out Mrs. Martinetti (Loredana Nusciak; <B><A HREF="no_way_out_1973.htm">NO
    WAY OUT</A></B> - 1973) hired Chiarotti to get dirt on her 
   millionaire husband when she learned he was divorcing her (&quot;The 
   best defense is a good offence, like they say. As my husband's a 
   millionaire, I did what I had to.&quot;). It turns out Chiarotti was 
   an awful private eye, as Mr. Martinetti caught him in the act, but 
   then he decided to abandon the divorce. Solmi questions Mr. 
   Martinetti on the golf course and he calls Chiarotti a &quot;dirty 
   little blackmailer&quot; who, instead of turning over the 
   incriminating audio tape to his wife, he offered to sell it to him, 
   figuring he'll get more money that way. Mr. Martinetti paid Chiarotti 
   two million lire, but he tells Solmi it was no big deal, just part of 
   the life of a millionaire.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Massu and his nameless associate (Carlo Gaddi; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#KillPokerPlayer1972">KILL
    THE POKER PLAYER</A></B> - 1972) dressed as orderlies, who enter 
   Giuliana's hospital room, knock-out the cop who is guarding her and 
   inject her with a sedative, wheeling her unconscious body out of the 
   hospital on a gurney, killing two cops with machine guns when they 
   try to stop them from leaving. Solmi tells Mannino in the hospital 
   that this proves that Chiarotti was killed by hired professionals, 
   not by Giuliana and Mannino agrees, but what he doesn't agree with 
   are Solmi's methods, blaming him for Giuliana's kidnapping. Solmi 
   blames Mannino, saying his office refused his request for extra 
   officers on this case. Solmi says now is the time to sweat Remo for 
   the truth if they hope to get Giuliana back alive, but Mannino says 
   he released Remo from custody because he didn't have enough 
   sufficient evidence to hold him. Solmi arrests up a disguised Remo at 
   the airport and as he and Luigi are driving him back to headquarters, 
   a motorcycle cop pulls them over for speeding, only it's not really a 
   cop at all, as he pulls out a silencer-equipped pistol and shoots 
   Remo in the head and then shoots the police radio in the car, 
   disabling it. Solmi and Luigi give chase, but they are chased by 
   Massu in another car. Solmi shoots the fake cop off his motorcycle, 
   but Massu picks him up and another chase ensues, where Solmi's car 
   overturns and the bad guys get away.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Massu and his associate tell Giuliana that if she confesses to 
   Chiarotti's murder, she will do no more than six years in prison and 
   when she is released, there will be a hundred million lire waiting 
   for her in a Swiss bank account. They give her one day to think about 
   it, but when Massu leaves Giuliana alone with his associate to guard 
   her, she uses her female charms to seduce him. As they are doing the 
   dirty on a bed, she grabs his gun, shoots him and escapes. She finds 
   a phone booth at a closed gas station and phone Solmi, who tells her 
   to stay put, he'll be right there. As soon as she hangs up the phone, 
   she is strangled to death by Massu, but he doesn't know that Giuliana 
   has left Solmi a clue to her killer, writing the name 
   &quot;Massu&quot; in the phone book in the booth. This leads Solmi to 
   discover Massu's real name, which is Giovanni Andreassi (Solmi had no 
   idea who Massu was until this moment). An all points bulletin (APB) 
   goes out for Massu's capture and an undercover cop, dressed as a bum, 
   sees him enter a bar and radios Solmi. After a short foot chase 
   (where Massu kills a cop), Solmi disarms and beats the shit out of 
   Massu. Under questioning, Massu confesses to killing Chiarotti and 
   Giuliana, but says he was just following orders from his boss...Mr. 
   Martinetti. Martinetti was involved in something very big and 
   Chiarotti was blackmailing him because of it, so he ordered Massu to 
   kill him, but Giuliana was an unfortunate victim, being in the wrong 
   place at the wrong time. The only problem is, Solmi is having trouble 
   arresting Martinetti thanks to D.A. Mannino's constant interference, 
   telling Solmi it will take more than a confession by a hired killer 
   to arrest someone as important as Martinetti.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Massu is murdered in a fake prison riot, all but destroying any 
   hope of arresting Martinetti, Mannino decides to go to Solmi's side, 
   tired of all the senseless deaths in this criminal case, but when 
   Detective Luca is killed when he starts up Solmi's car in the police 
   parking lot and it explodes, it proves no one can be trusted, not the 
   cops, not the D.A.'s office, no one. And just who is this Rienzi, 
   whose name keeps popping up <A HREF="silent_action_1975.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/silent action italy poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="214" HEIGHT="308" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>throughout
    the film? Think you have an idea what is going on here? Is D.A. 
   Mannino somehow involved in all this? You'll have to watch the film 
   for the answers, but the clues are in this review. Like most 
   Eurocrime films, there is a bittersweet finale, which opens up a new 
   can of worms, but you'll have to watch very closely to pick it up.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Once again, Sergio Martino is able to coax a great performance from 
   Luc Merenda, giving him some off-the-cuff dialogue that is quite 
   funny (He tells Luca to save the &quot;fuck you's&quot; until he 
   leave the area after he reneges on Luca's deal for a day off with his 
   kids). The screenplay, by Martino, Massimo Felisatti (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#ManiacResponsible">THE
    MANIAC RESPONSIBLE</A></B> -1975), Fabio Pittorru (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#NightEvelynGrave71">THE

   Gianfranco Couyoumdjian (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Tornado1983">TORNADO:
    THE LAST BLOOD</A></B> - 1983) is full of little funny asides, most 
   of them coming out of Merenda's mouth (A close second is Gianfranco 
   Barra as Luca, who has some very choice and funny lines, making his 
   death that much more shocking). The truth is, Merenda was a hit or 
   miss actor, the misses being his roles in Fernando De Leo's <B><A HREF="nick_the_sting_1976.htm">NICK

   (1973; my favorite giallo film of all time). The fact is, this is an 
   excellent Eurocrime film, full of Martino's patented directorial 
   flourishes, violent and graphic deaths and a damn good mystery to 
   boot, as well as some excellently choreographed action set pieces, 
   including a raid on a mercenary camp in the finale, where Luigi 
   tosses hand grenades from a helicopter, while Solmi chases 
   &quot;Rienzi&quot; on foot, which results in a gunfight to the death. 
   If you want to be thoroughly entertained for 98 minutes, this film is

   project for the late Anna Nicole Smith (who was also an associate

   (she even does a nude shower scene in the first 15 minutes), but as 
   soon as she opens her mouth to speak, it's easy to see she can't act 
   a lick and her slurred speach shows that, even back in 1995, she had

   over a highrise building. Yes, this is a gender-reversal rip-off of <B><A HREF="die_hard_1988.htm">DIE
    HARD</A></B> (1988) and is only recommended for those who like to 
   watch tragic train wrecks. The train wreck is, of course, Anna Nicole 
   Smith and watching her try to act is truly a painful experience for 
   the viewer (she literally cannot walk and chew gum at the same time, 
   which is never more evident when she tries to run with a gun in her 
   hands). While the film is very violent (hardly a minute goes by 
   without someone getting shot, beat up or blown up), most of the film 
   lifts scenes and characters verbatim from <B>DIE HARD</B>, from Anna 
   Nicole's close call while swinging off the side of the skyscraper and 
   crashing through a window in the nick of time, only to almost be 
   pulled back out the window by the weight of the object falling from 
   the other end of the cable and the fact that some of the terrorists 
   have long blond hair and speak with a German accent. There's also the 
   co-worker that offers to bring Karen in for his freedom (only to be 
   shot dead), the gun-shy security guard (substituting for Reginald Vel 
   Johnson's cop) who uses his gun to save Karen's life and many other 
   instances which would give the makers of <B>DIE HARD</B> more than 
   enough evidence to sue for copyright infringement. There's a subplot 
   where Karen's detective husband Gordy (Richard Steinmetz) breaks into 
   the skyscraper trying to save her (In the beginning, she yells at 
   him, &quot;I want a baby!&quot; after they make love in the shower, 
   in one of the film's creepier moments), but it goes nowhere. Director

    who suffers from nightmares from his stint in the Vietnam War. It's 
   apparent to see from the opening shot that it is going to take some 
   heavy intestinal fortitude to get through the entire film. A 
   flashback (which looks like it was filmed in someone's back yard 
   [actually Tennessee and Florida]) shows Buddy cheating death when a 
   V.C.'s (Quan Nguyen T) gun fails to discharge and he shoots the gook. 
   He saves the faulty bullet and wears it around his neck. Sixteen 
   years later, he's a chain-smoking, drug-addicted, drunken bum who 
   obsesses over his time in Nam (and particularly, one episode during 
   the end of his tour), talking about it to himself in his dingy room, 
   arguing about it with his girlfriend (Lisa Leonard) or commiserating 
   over it with his uncaring shrink (Vic &quot;Bruno&quot; Akers), who 
   keeps interrupting the sessions to take personal phone calls. Buddy 
   has hallucinations of the gook raping and killing his girlfriend and 
   spray paints a scope sight on his cinderblock bedroom wall. He keeps 
   ranting to himself while taking sips from his booze bottle (and badly 
   superimposed stock footage of the war is projected on his face). It 
   gets to the point that you hope that bullet he wears around his neck 
   would spontaneously explode, so there would be a premature ending to 
   this film. Alas, the cycle of Buddy ranting to himself, his shrink, 
   his girlfriend and having flashbacks are repeated over and over until 
   the film ends a long 95 minutes later. If there is a moral to this 
   film, it is this: If you are part of a platoon who rape and kill 
   innocent gook women during the war, don't expect your girlfriend to 
   come out unscathed in the present.&nbsp; It's hard to describe what 
   one feels when watching this film. It's apparent the novice director 
   Allen Wright and screenwriter Kenneth Ward (who both have roles as 
   soldiers in Buddy's platoon) were trying to make a serious statement 
   about the plight of Vietnam vets that came home to an uncaring public 
   (as demonstrated by the shrink), but damn, it's hard to take this 
   seriously, especially when some hair metal bands' (Convicted and 
   Vandetta) music keeps popping up on the sountrack. The lyrics to 
   their original songs are way out of place (one song repeats the 
   chorus: &quot;Bang, Bang, You're Dead. You're Fucking Dead!&quot;) 
   and the ballad (&quot;Still Waiting&quot;) that plays during the 
   scene where Buddy is first making love, then fighting, with his 
   girlfriend, is so far over the top that you forget you're watching a 
   war film. Toss in endless dialogue scenes, solarized shots (a 
   favorite with SOV films because the button is right there on the 
   video camera, begging to be pushed), endless flashbacks (are there 
   maple trees in Vietnam?) and that tinny live sound that comes with 
   shooting on video, and you have one hard-to-find film that deserves 
   to stay that way. It felt like it lasted longer than the actual war. 
   This is another one of those films that my friend William Wilson 
   likes to send to me. I'm beginning to think he finds satisfaction in 
   torturing me. Also starring Steadman Stahl and Tony Akers.&nbsp; A

    SILENCERS</A><A NAME="SpecialSilencers"></A> (1979) - </B>Oh my God! 
   This is one of the most outrageously insane action/fantasy films I 
   have ever had the pleasure to view. This is one funny Indonesian 
   film, thanks to whoever was responsible for the hilarious dubbing and 
   the unusual screenplay (by Deddy Armand). The story is simple: 
   Conniving crook Gundar (Dicky Zulkamaen, who gets to spout the best 
   lines) wants to be mayor of the town. The only problem is that there 
   already is a mayor and he is bringing a special cop into town to 
   investigate some funny business that is going on. Luckily Gundar has 
   these red pills he keeps in a small box around his neck. They are 
   called &quot;Special Silencers&quot; and he stole them from his monk 
   grandfather (but not before his grandfather cut off his right leg 
   right below the knee!). When injested, the silencers grows plants in 
   the person's stomach and branches burst out of the chest, mouth and 
   eyes. Gundar (who has skin made of steel thanks to a practice he 
   learned from his grandfather) takes a meeting with the mayor and puts 
   one of the red pills into the mayor's coffee when he's not looking. A 
   couple of minutes later, the mayor is lying on the floor screaming 
   while plants shoot out of his stomach,<A HREF="special_silencers_1979.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/special silencers vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   mouth and eyes (I guarantee that you will be shocked as well as 
   laugh). Gundar has his henchmen destroy the bridge leading into town 
   to stop the special cop from making it into town. With the cop is the 
   mayor's daughter Julia (Eva Arnez) and they both meet Hendra (Barry 
   Prima), who stops on his motorcycle to help Julia and the cop (who is 
   her Uncle) refill their car's radiator with water. All three stop at 
   the bridge and Hendra goes on his motorcycle to bring back help to 
   fix the bridge (He jumps the broken bridge with his motorcycle like 
   Evel Knievel). While Hendra is away, Julia and her Uncle decide to 
   have a picnic. Unfortunately, Gundar's right-hand man Gumilar (W.D. 
   Mochtar) is waiting behind the bushes and puts a red pill in the 
   food. While Julia is off taking a dip at the river, her Uncle starts 
   eating the food on the bridge and he falls down and screams in pain 
   as plantlife comes bursting out of every orifice. Julia comes running 
   and passes out after seeing the condition her Uncle is in.&nbsp; The 
   rest of the film finds Gundar trying to kill Julia and Hendra, as 
   they are the only people standing in his way from becoming the mayor. 
   A few more people will swallow the red pills and there are many 
   martial arts fights between Julia, Hendra and Gundar's inept fighting 
   force.&nbsp; Believe me when I say that once you watch this you will 
   never ever forget it. Director Arizal (who also made the amazing<B> <A HREF="#Stabilizer">THE
    STABILIZER</A></B> - 1984 and the astounding <B><A HREF="#Final Score">FINAL
    SCORE</A></B> - 1986), peppers the film with constant fighting, 
   outlandish sound effects and a great amount of graphic gore and 
   carnage. The red pill scenes are very well done and extremely bloody. 
   I found myself laughing out loud on many occasions and I believe that 
   a lot of it was intentional, although some of the dubbing was to 
   blame, too. You know you're in for something special when right in 
   the beginning Gundar says to Gumilar, &quot;If you're going to be 
   tenderhearted about it, then take your tender heart some place 
   else!&quot; He also says on one occasion to Hendra, &quot;You'll 
   never kill me, so let me go!&quot; My favorite line comes after one 
   of Gundar's henchmen, named Tonto, gets impaled on a tree branch 
   after fighting with Hendra. Gundar later says to Gumilar, &quot;Why 
   didn't you bring Tonto's body back with you?&quot; Gumilar replies 
   back, &quot;I didn't have a saw!&quot;&nbsp; There are also some 
   outlandish setpieces on view, too, such as when Hendra and Julia are 
   at her father's grave when all of a sudden a dozen of Gundar's men 
   come popping up out of the ground and out of coffins to fight the 
   duo. Hendra also does a truck stunt that is very similar to the one 
   Harrison Ford does in <B><A HREF="raiders_of_the_lost_ark_1981.htm">RAIDERS
    OF THE LOST ARK</A></B> (1981), although this one was done three 
   years earlier! There's also a scene where Hendra rolls down a room in 
   a barrel while holding a sickle and slices off a fighters leg (and 
   knocks off Gundar's fake leg), a shot of a snake eating a rat, a 
   mouse attack on Julia while she is tied up (Gundar calls them his 
   &quot;black commandos&quot;) and plenty of the red stuff (some of it 
   shoots right into the camera lens), including a fight in a lumber 
   mill where Gumilar gets his head shoved into the spinning blade of a 
   giant lumber saw! I'll leave the rest for you, the viewer to enjoy as 
   there is so much more here to take in. This film officially makes it 
   into my CritCon top 20 films of all time! The version I viewed was

   When a genius professor (Kaharuddin Syah) is kidnapped by Victor 
   (Mark Sunglar), a henchman for international crimelord Greg Rainmaker 
   (Craig Gavin), the Indonesian government sends for FBI agent Peter 
   Goldson (Peter O'Brian), known as &quot;The Stabilizer&quot;, to 
   rescue the professor and bring down Rainmaker. Peter has a severe 
   hate for Rainmaker, because seven years earlier, he raped and killed 
   Peter's fiancee by stepping on her with spiked shoes, his weapon of 
   choice (As she lies there dying, her last words to Peter are, 
   &quot;Watch out for his shoes!&quot;). Rainmaker kidnapped the 
   professor because he has invented a &quot;narcotics detector&quot; 
   and he will not give Rainmaker the formula (this plot device is all 
   but dropped after the kidnapping). When Victor sets up and captures 
   Peter and his cop friend Johnny (Harry Capri), they are saved by crossbow-<A HREF="stabilizer_1984.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/stabilizer troma dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="171" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>wielding
    Christina (Dana Christina), the professor's daughter (I also think 
   this is the first time I have ever seen anyone killed with a weed 
   whacker!). Christina joins forces with Peter, Johnny and Peter's FBI 
   partner Sylvia (Gillie Beanz) to look for her father. They find him, 
   but he is killed in the rescue attempt. Rainmaker kidnaps Christina 
   (&quot;She should give me some fun!&quot;), so Peter, Johnny and 
   Sylvia travel by speedboat to Rainmaker's private island (after 
   avoiding some torpedos!) to rescue her. They find Rainmaker's 
   ex-mistress Nora (Yenny Faridha) tied-up with a bomb around her neck 
   (long story) and disarm it (if you count throwing it away from you 
   while it explodes disarming it). Nora agrees to take them to 
   Rainmaker's compound, but they are all taken prisoner and tied-up in 
   a burning warehouse (Rainmaker says to Peter, in one of my favorite 
   lines ever: &quot;You'll soon meet God. Tell him I'm doing fine 
   here.&quot;). They manage to break free and then get into one of the 
   bloodiest shootouts/matorcycle chases in film history. Peter finally 
   catches Rainmaker and stomps on him with Rainmaker's own spiked shoes 
   (&quot;This is for my wo-man!&quot;), but Rainmaker manages to escape 
   by helicopter. Not for long, though!&nbsp; This highly entertaining, 
   yet brainless, action flick made me laugh so many times, I thought I 
   was going to have a coronary. From the opening scene, when a guy on a 
   motorcycle crashes through a window of the professor's house, only to 
   get off his bike to open the front door to let Victor in (!), to the 
   unbelievable conclusion, where too many things happen to explain, 
   you'll be shaking your head so much in disbelief, you're lucky if you 
   don't come down with a case of whiplash. So many vehicles come 
   crashing through windows or walls, you'll wonder if anyone in this 
   film (besides Victor) knows how to use a door! Nevermind that lead 
   actor Peter O'Brian is the mirror image of Frank Stallone if he had a 
   permed mullet (Wait. He did at one time, didn't he?), just sit back 
   and enjoy all the mindless violence, nudity, explosions and car 
   chases/crashes. Not only does one of Victor's goons look like Mr. T 
   (who was popular at the time with <B><A HREF="a_team_tv_series_1983-1987.htm">THE
    A-TEAM</A></B> [1983 - 1987]), you will also see a guy geek lizards 
   (disgusting scenes of a man ripping apart lizards with his teeth), 
   watch in amazement as Rainmaker kills his own men for disappointing 
   him (he strings one guy up, gives him a couple of kicks to the knees 
   with his spiked shoes and then electrocutes him!) and listen to the 
   hysterical dialogue. This is Peter's opinion of Rainmaker: &quot;He's 
   the man I hate the most. I despise scum like Rainmaker!&quot; And 
   Rainmaker says this to Nora when he thinks that she's betrayed him 
   (she hasn't): &quot;If you weren't so good in bed, I'd kill you right 
   now!&quot; I especially loved Victor's remark to Nora, just before he 
   kills her: &quot;Dance to your grave, you dirty whore!&quot; So, if

    shoots Gage in the head. TechStar decides to test their prototype 
   soldier, dubbed &quot;Stealthhunter, Soldier of the 21st Century&quot;
    (impossibly cheap concoctions consisting of skinny guys all dressed 
   in black wearing masks that cover the top half of their heads), so 
   they use about a dozen of the prototypes to fight a platoon of real 
   soldiers, commanded by Captain Fields (Rocky Patterson; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Nail Gun Massacre">THE
    NAIL GUN MASSACRE</A></B> - 1985), in what is advertised as a 
   harmless &quot;wargame&quot;. Yeah, right. The dastardly Mitchell and 
   Dr. Landers (Gordon Fox), the lead scientist on the Stealthhunter 
   project, set their squad of computerized cyborgs on &quot;kill&quot; 
   and it's not long before they kill all the soldiers in the field 
   except for Burke (Bruce Walker), who manages to escape by hitching a 
   ride with five annoying teens on their way to a picnic, with the 
   Stealthhunters hot on their trail. Wouldn't you know it, the teens' 
   pickup truck runs out of gas (caused by a Stealthhunter's bullet to 
   their gas tank), forcing Burke and the teens to take shelter in a 
   deserted garage. While Captain Burke is held prisoner at TechStar 
   (Dr. Landers is about to turn him into a Stealthhunter), Burke tries 
   to protect the teens from the onslaught of black-clad cyborgs 
   (frankly, most of the teens don't deserve to live, especially Cy 
   [Vince Phillip], who seems to always do the wrong things at the most 
   inopportune times), teaching them how to fight back and defend 
   themselves. Can Captain Fields escape from the TechStar operating 
   room to rescue Burke and the teens?&nbsp; This impossibly cheap 
   shot-on-video wonder, directed/produced by Matthew Trotter (his only 
   feature film) and written by Trotter and Tom Anthony, is a total 
   mess, with plenty of amateur acting (lots of Texan accents here), 
   flat, smeary video photography, a grating synthesizer score and some 
   really bad dialogue (listen closely to two TechStar interns talking 
   about comic books during the end of the film to experience a truly 
   head-scratching moment). The film's only saving grace is the 
   plentiful gore, as limbs are hacked off, bodies are graphically run 
   over, people are riddled with bullets and shotgun blasts, throats are 
   slashed and body parts are stabbed with knives. The make-up effects 
   may be less than professional, but there are at least a lot of them 
   on view, nearly enough to get your mind off the amateur video look of 
   the film and the mawkish, sappy dialogue between some of the teens. 
   Plotwise, <B>STEALTHHUNTERS</B> is a run-of-the-mill actioner that 
   tries to copy it's big-budget counterparts (strangely, though, the 
   similarly-themed <B><A HREF="universal_soldier_1992.htm">UNIVERSAL SOLDIER</A></B> 
   would come out a year later) and fails miserably, but at least it has 
   the good sense to kill-off most of the teens before they can be 
   rescued. For that I am extremely grateful. Other Texas-lensed

    ARENA</A><A NAME="Steel Arena"></A> (1973) -</B> Stunt-filled car 
   crash actioner that mixes fact with fiction. Dusty Russell (playing 
   himself) drifts into a small Southern town and accepts a job from bar 
   owner Harry (Bill McKnight) driving and delivering moonshine in a 
   souped-up 1939 Dodge. Before he can make his first delivery, Dusty is 
   chased by an overweight sheriff (Eric Nord) and his deputies, which 
   leads to many wrecked police cars and Dusty barely getting away. When 
   Harry refuses to pay Dusty, it leads to a bar fight where Dusty meets 
   new friend Buddy Love (playing himself). Along with Harry's 
   ex-waitress Jo-Ann (Laura Brooks), Dusty's new squeeze, they head to 
   Jefferson, where they enter the Dodge in a demolition derby with 
   Dusty as the driver. Before the derby even starts, Dusty makes an 
   enemy in competing driver The Masked Marvel and, sure enough, Dusty 
   wins the derby by destroying the Masked Marvel's car. Dusty and Buddy 
   are hired to become members of owner Gene Drew's (playing himself) 
   Daredevils stunt driving team and, pretty soon, Dusty and Buddy are 
   doing barrel rolls, dive bombs and crashing through walls of fire in

    that travels throughout the South. Fellow stunt driver Crash 
   Chambers (Bruce Mackey) grows jealous of Dusty's new popularity (Gene 
   makes him the star of the show) and endangers everyone's lives when 
   he suddenly replaces the regular driver in one of the two-car head-on 
   collision stunts where Dusty is the other driver. Unbeknownst to 
   Crash, Buddy convinces Dusty to let him take his place in the stunt 
   and Buddy ends up seriously wounded when Crash purposely misses his 
   mark. Crash then slashes the safety harness in the car Dusty is about 
   to use in a record-breaking 80 foot dive bomb stunt. Dusty is wounded 
   and Gene fires Crash for his sabotage with Crash declaring that he 
   will get even. The finale finds Dusty about to do a hundred foot dive 
   bomb, with Crash watching in the audience. Dusty's fate is left 
   uncertain, as he completes the jump, is taken away in an ambulance 
   and the final scene is of Jo-Ann hopping on a Greyhound bus. The 
   lyrics of the song, playing over a shot of Jo-Ann's tear-stained 
   face, go &quot;I don't want you cryin' when I'm gone&quot;, which 
   could suggest two things: 1) Dusty has bitten the dust, or 2) Jo-Ann 
   has left Dusty because she cannot stand to watch him put his life in 
   constant danger night after night. You decide.&nbsp; While nothing 
   but a series of precision car stunts interspread with scenes of the 
   (mostly) non-professional cast trying their best to keep their heads

   - 1981) offers a fascinating, almost documentary-like, 
   behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to put together a car stunt 
   show on a continuing basis. This involves visiting local junkyards 
   picking out cars for use in the show and traveling countless miles 
   from one location to the next, with the team breaking up the constant 
   boredom by tapping their cars into each other on the back streets to 
   stay awake and pulling pranks in bars to break up the monotony. It 
   helps immensely that nearly all the members of the stunt team are 
   played by the actual members. They may not be good actors, but their 
   presence adds realism to the proceedings. I was especially impressed 
   with the older Dutch Schnitzer, who, show after show, blows himself 
   up with sticks of dynamite while laying in a wooden box. Now that's 
   dedication to your craft, especially when you take into consideration 
   that he's probably old enough to collect Social Security. This is 
   director Lester's first theatrical feature (his first non-theatrical 
   film, 1971's <B>TWILIGHT OF THE MAYAS</B>, was a documentary about 
   the mining industry in Mexico) and, while it's not great cinema, it's 
   an entertaining look at a subject that may be foreign to many viewers 
   (I went to many of these stunt shows during my youth). While there is 
   nothing remotely offensive on view (unless you find smoking and 
   drinking offensive, as everyone here does both), <B><A HREF="steel_arena_1973b.htm">STEEL

   tries to stop the nerve gas from being dispensed. Cooper must also 
   rescue the Congresswoman again when it is revealed that William

   Richter then takes his turn and gives it a go!). Never fear, because 
   Cooper isn't far behind. Expect lots of ass-kickings and 
   explosions.&nbsp; This is the third, and final, actioner that 
   Filipino director/producer Cirio H. Santiago made with martial 
   artist/non-actor Jerry &quot;Golden Boy&quot; Trimble (<B><A HREF="#LiveByTheFist">LIVE
    BY THE FIST</A></B> [1992] and <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#OneManArmy">ONE
    MAN ARMY</A></B> [1993] being the other two) and it is definitely 
   the worst of the trio. While the other two were nothing to write home 
   about, <B><A HREF="stranglehold_1994b.htm">STRANGLEHOLD</A></B> is a 
   tepid affair at best and the fact that it took three people (Mark 
   Evan Schwartz, Brendan Broderick and Rob Kerchner) to write the 
   generic screenplay speaks volumes on how desperate this film really 
   is. It's nothing but a series of badly-staged gun battles, martial 
   arts fights and chases, none of them particularly exciting or bloody. 
   It's pretty clear that at this stage in his career, director Santiago 
   was running on fumes and delivers a film that lacks any vibrancy or 
   life. It didn't help that Roger Corman, who financed the majority of 
   Santiago's films, forced Santiago to make this film on a budget that 
   wouldn't feed a hungry family at dinnertime. Most of the film takes 
   place at either the same boiler room set (filmed at different angles) 
   or at a boardroom where the American government representatives 
   (including Santiago staples Ken Metcalfe and Henry Strzalkowski) 
   endlessly discuss what to do about Richter and his demands (They, of 
   course, end up doing nothing and only serve to pad out the film's 
   paltry running time). We all know how bad Jerry Trimble is as an 
   actor (he also looks like he packed on a few pounds since <B>ONE MAN ARMY</B>),
    but the usually reliable Vernon Wells is simply horrible here and 
   looks like he's coke-out or high on meth. This is quite possibly 
   Santiago's worst film ever and even though it's only 73 minutes long, 
   it's a chore to sit through. A total dud from start to finish. 
   Santiago would go on to direct only a handful of films after this 
   (2005's <B><A HREF="bloodfist_2050_2005.htm">BLOODFIST 2050</A></B> 
   is his last as of this writing), but he is still active as a 
   producer. Also starring James Paolelli, Tony Carreon, Joe Sabatino, 
   Joseph Zucchero (also this film's Editor), Jim Broome, Paul Holmes 
   and Ramon D'Salva. Available on VHS &amp; <A HREF="stranglehold_1994_dvd.htm">DVD</A> 
   from New Horizons/New Concorde Home Video. <B>Rated R</B>. <B>NOTE:</B> 
   Sadly, Cirio H. Santiago passed away in 2008 and his last film, <B>WATER
    WARS</B> (co-directed by Jim Wynorski when Santiago passed away in 
   the middle of filming), is still looking for a U.S. home video 
   distributor. Word is, that as the films stands right now, it is 
   unsalable (From what I heard, lead actor Michael Madsen looks drunk 
   as a skunk throughout the entire film and the different styles 
   between the two directors is highly obvious). When even Roger Corman 
   can't sell a film, you know there has to be serious problems with it, 
   but eventually everything makes it to home video.</FONT></FONT></P>

   film opens with Max (Johnathan Gorman) and Spud (Darrel Guilbeau),

   Spider (Jude Gerard) and other members of the rival J.P. gang. Max's

    a gang of good guys from his high school, but Max will soon learn 
   after Spud's death that being the leader of a gang isn't all shits 
   and giggles. His major trouble will come from Priest (Jeff Rector; <B><A HREF="hundra_1983.htm">HELLMASTER</A></B> 
   - 1992), the leader of the J.P.s, who was just released from prison. 
   Priest has brought a new friend with him: the mute Tok (Jason Hwang), 
   who had his tongue cut out in a prison fight. After teaching Spider a 
   lesson for breaking the truce he imposed while he was serving time in 
   prison, Priest sets his sights on the Tigers, especially when Max's 
   straight-laced brother Troy (David Homb; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Camp Fear">CAMP
    FEAR</A></B> - 1991) becomes romantically involved with Julie 
   (Katherine Armstrong), Priest's ex-girlfriend who has just returned 
   to town after a long absence. The J.P.s invade the high school dance 
   and a rumble breaks out. Priest goes nutsoid and fires his gun in the 
   gymnasium (All the fighters hit the floor until Priest runs out of 
   bullets. They then stand back up and continue fighting each other 
   like nothing happened!). Charles and Troy becomes fast friends when 
   they defend each other during the rumble. Luckily, Charles' uncle is 
   Master Han and he teaches Troy how to defend himself using just his 
   hands, but first he must be taught discipline. Troy turns out to be a 
   natural and learns martial arts quite easily (in true 80's montage 
   fashion). As Troy and Julie's romantic relationship grows stronger, 
   Priest becomes more enraged and violent and tries to take his rage 
   out on Troy, Charles and Max, but they manage to escape (by jumping 
   off a bridge onto the back of a moving hay bale truck [thank God 
   these things are around when you really need them!]). Priest 
   retaliates by invading the Tigers' clubhouse, killing three Tigers 
   members and putting Max in the hospital. The police want Max to turn 
   state's evidence against Priest, but Max prefers to take care of 
   Priest himself. Troy and Charles are forced to join-in on the fun 
   when Priest tries to kidnap Julie. When Priest and the J.P.s 
   gang-rape Max's girlfriend Marie (Deborah Newmark) and put her in the 
   hospital, Max and the Tigers join Master Han's school to learn 
   martial arts. When Charles is killed and Priest finally does kidnap 
   Julie (he ties her up and forces booze down her throat), Master Han 
   joins the fight. God help the J.P.s! Not every good guy makes it 
   through the final (and well-done) rumble, because lessons have to be 
   learned that the streets play no favorites when bullets are 
   involved.&nbsp; This crazy gang actioner, directed by Lee Harry (<B><A HREF="silent_night_deadly_night_2_1987.htm">SILENT
    NIGHT DEADLY NIGHT PART 2</A></B> - 1987) and co-written by Harry 
   and Spencer Grendhal, contains so many outrageous set pieces and 
   sight gags (including Tok's fake &quot;cobra in a box&quot;, that 
   spits out a green blinding liquid when squeezed!), it's hard not to 
   enjoy this film, even though it has enough holes in the plot to make 
   swiss cheese jealous. Some of the preachy dialogue is also pretty 
   hard to swallow, but when Priest breaks out a roll of condoms whan 
   they are about to gang-rape Marie and he says, &quot;Better safe than 
   sorry!&quot;, it more than makes up for the preachy moments. There is 
   plenty on violence on view, including shootings, stabbings, 
   neck-snapping, martial arts fights and, of course, rumbles, and Jeff 
   Rector steals the show as Priest, playing his role like he is 
   channeling Clint Eastwood if he were to turn bad. There's also plenty 
   of humor on view (Troy trying to explain baseball to Master Han [who 
   is well aware of the sport] is very funny, if only for the look on 
   Charles' face; when Priest kidnaps Julie and Spider tries to hit her 
   father with a two-by-four, Priest yells out, &quot;Don't kill him. 
   He's paying for the wedding!&quot;), some unusual camera set-ups and 
   nicely choreographed fight scenes, making <B><A HREF="street_soldiers_1989b.htm">STREET

    make a serious statement about a black man&#146;s struggle to rise 
   above drug selling and gang violence only to become the boss of the 
   city&#146;s biggest drug-running outfits. Unfortunately, Fanaka 
   fumbles the ball and turns in an unintentionally hilarious fable 
   complete with badly executed action scenes, risable dialogue, 
   unbelievable characters and awful post-synch dubbing. Black military 
   student Sugarpop (Alan Joseph) comes home during summer vacation to 
   spend some time with his older brother Frank (Byran O&#146;Dell), the 
   head of a drug syndicate. When Frank is murdered by a rival drug 
   gang, Sugarpop takes over and uses his military training to exact 
   revenge. He trains his gang (including a drag queen!) on how to 
   operate motorized hang gliders and they use them to attack their 
   rivals from the air! The film ends on a high note when Sugarpop blows 
   away the white rival leader and rids the entire city of drugs, 
   turning his brother&#146;s syndicate into a legitimate business! This 
   is one of the most unbelievable endings of all times. Often surreal 
   at times (Frank&#146;s funeral is jaw-dropping stuff as Soul 
   Train-style dancers boogie around his coffin while Fanaka [real name: 
   Walter Gordon!!!] himself sings an awful gospel tune), this is by no 
   means a good film but is OK for a good belly laugh if you are in the 
   right frame of mind (say about a case of Bud or three good joints).

   singing some bad disco tune at a nightclub and she immediately blows

   drug deal is going down. This leads to a big shootout, where Patricia 
   and her fellow officers shoot all the bad guys (some in the back!) 
   and nearly destroy all the drug evidence in a hail of gunfire. On a 
   totally unrelated note, Patricia's father, a sheriff in the small

   in a few days, a quartet of her Miami cop buddies, Tom (Corwyn 
   Sperry), Tony (James Paolelli), Jack (Ernie Santana) and Max (Ned 
   Hourani), head to Wilbury County and run into the new sheriff: Mike 
   Gray! The four Miami cops get into a barroom brawl and are forced to 
   kill the shotgun-toting bartender. Mike arrests them and tosses them 
   in jail, where the crooked mayor, Bob (Anthony East; <B><A HREF="#FastGun">FAST
    GUN</A></B> - 1987; here using the pseudonym &quot;Albert 
   Bronsky&quot;), orders Mike to kill them all, but Patricia breaks 
   them out before Mike can carry out the order. Patricia brings them 
   all back to Jake's shack, where Jake tells them that something 
   illegal is going on, but he doesn't know what it is. What he is sure 
   of, though, is that it is going on at an abandoned plantation, so 
   Jake takes them there, where they overhear Mike and Bob talking about 
   a major cocaine shipment coming in tonight by plane. Also on the 
   plane is Alfredo Strocssner (Robert Marius; <B><A HREF="#FistOfGlory">FIST
    OF GLORY</A></B> - 1991; here using the pseudonym &quot;Edward 
   Burnett&quot;), a &quot;half-Nazi, half-Brazilian&quot; drug lord who 
   is responsible for killing Tom's partner in the past and getting away 
   with it on a legal technicality. Our heroic Miami cops wait for the 
   drug deal to take place, steal the shipment and try to fly back to 
   Miami, but Max is shot and injured (not to mention almost being 
   killed in a pretty impressive plane explosion) and they are forced to 
   escape into the woods. Alfredo becomes mightily ticked-off that his 
   cocaine is gone, so he brings in a lot of his own men to search the 
   woods. When Max dies of his injuries and Jake sacrifices himself, 
   Patricia and the two remaining Miami cops get vengeance on Mike, Bob 
   and Alfredo.&nbsp; Technically, the film is a mess, with a lousy 
   sound recording mix (the music drowns out most of the dialogue) and 
   some hinky editing and camerawork, but director/producer David Hung 
   (here using the name &quot;David Hunt&quot;) and screenwriter Steve 
   Rogers (both responsible for the comedic actioner <B><A HREF="#TripleImpact1992">TRIPLE
    IMPACT</A></B> in 1992) still manage to wrangle some suspense and 
   good action set-pieces on a paltry budget, including the 
   aforementioned plane explosion; a tense situation involving an 
   overturned pickup truck with Jake's leg trapped underneath it; a 
   helicopter/motorboat chase; and plenty of gunfights and explosions. 
   Thankfully, the acting talents of Andrea Lamatsch (who sounds like 
   she is channeling Arnold Schwarzenegger) takes a back seat to the 
   action and while there is very little blood or gore (just some bloody 
   bullet squibs and a nifty bullet-to-the-head shot), it's nice to see 
   a bunch of American expatriate actors like Corwyn Sperry, James 
   Paolelli, Ernie Santana, Ned Hourani, Jeff Griffith, Robert Marius, 
   Anthony East and Mike Monty get some major screen time for a change 
   instead of playing their normal secondary or background characters 
   (Monty gets the best death scene here, as Paolelli shoves a stick of 
   dynamite in his mouth and blows him out a window). Not a bad way to 
   spend 95 minutes as long as you don't set your sites too high. Shot 
   in the Philippines by Davian International Productions. Nick

    when he pulls-up next to his car while on his motorcycle and then 
   shoots another guy later on in a subway car. He then heads to Rome, 
   when he shoots another guy at a cocktail party. Crooked cop Captain 
   John Kiley (Karl Malden) is paid $10,000 to find out who is killing 
   all the Mob's semi-retired men (you never fully retire in the Mob, 
   unless you're dead). Ray travels to Madrid to kill his latest target, 
   Mob kingpin Alfredi (Raf Vallone), but this hit isn't going to go as 
   easy as the rest, because Alfredi lives in a well-guarded villa. Ray 
   gets romantically involved with Alfredi's secretary (Claudine Auger) 
   to try to find a way into the villa. Captain Kiley shows up at the 
   villa just as Ray is about to shoot Alfredi with a high-powered 
   rifle. The glare of Kiley's car windshield hits Ray in the eyes just 
   as he pulls the trigger, causing him to only wound Alfredi. Ray 
   barely gets away on his motorcycle when Alfredi's men chase him on 
   horseback. Captain Kiley starts piecing the puzzle together (Alfredi 
   and the three dead men were partners back in 1952, the year Ray's 
   father was murdered) and he goes to Alfredi's secretary for some 
   information, where he learns that Alfredi has a secret daughter, 
   Tania (Olivia Hussey; <B><A HREF="black_christmas_1974.htm">BLACK CHRISTMAS</A></B> 
   - 1974), who is going to school in France. Ray already has that 
   information and has kidnapped Tania and is holding her prisoner on a 
   boat anchored in the ocean, using her as bait to draw Alfredi out in 
   the open. The only problem is, both Captain Kiley and Alfredi now 
   know Ray's true identity and they both want him, but for different 
   reasons. Ray and Tania, after a rocky start (where Tania attempts 
   numerous escapes and tries to kill Ray with a sharpened closet pole), 
   begin to fall in love. Ray, who has lived his entire life with only 
   vengeance on his mind, has only experienced love previously through 
   the dogs he has owned as pets since his childhood, so his feeling for 
   Tania are alien to him. When Tania discovers that her kidnapping was 
   not for money, but revenge (She says to Ray, &quot;You're one of 
   them!&quot;), it sets the stage for a finale set at a bullfight, 
   where Ray, Alfredi and Captain Kiley converge. Ray's feelings for 
   Tania force him to hesitate to take the killshot, which results in 
   him getting wounded, stealing a motorcycle and leading everyone on a 
   long chase. When Ray returns to his boat, Captain Kiley is there 
   waiting for him, gives Ray an implied surprise revelation (Kiley may 
   be something more than just a cop) and an even more surprising scene 
   of knowing sacrifice in the film's closing shot.&nbsp; This Spanish/French/Italian

   actor to begin with, but given the right vehicle (like <B><A HREF="#Final Score">FINAL

   Unfortunately, this film is not that vehicle but, thankfully, Karl 
   Malden (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CatONineTails1971">THE CAT O' NINE TAILS</A></B> 
   - 1971) is here to pick up the slack. We are never quite sure what 
   Captain Kiley's true intentions are until the film's finale. What we 
   do know about him is that he has ties to the Mob and that he's a damn 
   good cop, as we watch him dig up clues to Ray's childhood, which will 
   eventually lead him to Ray's Madrid apartment. Ray's apartment is a 
   treasure trove of information, if only for what it lacks. The only 
   personal photo in the apartment is that of Ray as a young boy on the 
   beach with his mother and father. The only other objects in the 
   apartment are motorcycle models, pictures of sailboats and racing 
   trophies. We also find out that it was Ray's mother who instilled 
   this sense of vengeance into Ray when his father died, telling him 
   that it is better to seek justice &quot;within the family&quot; 
   rather than trust the police to do their job. While not overtly 
   violent (it was rated PG when released to U.S. theaters), <B><A HREF="summertime_killer_1972c.htm">THE
    SUMMERTIME KILLER</A></B> (the title makes no sense, unless we're

   couple of good car chase scenes (performed by Remy Julienne and his 
   crack stunt driving team), some quick bursts of violence (with that 
   bright red 70's blood that we've all come to love) and a surprising 
   shot of a skinned bull during the final chase. I was particularly 
   impressed with Ray's dog (a Boxer) sacrificing itself, biting a bad 
   guy on the neck while he is driving, causing a fiery car wreck, so 
   that Ray could escape. Man's best friend, indeed! Try to get past

   The bad guys eventually kidnap C.J. and Charles and bring them to the

   commune. The ringleaders finally make themselves known (it's really 
   no surprise) in the film's action-packed finale, where we find out if 
   the two million dollar stash really exists.&nbsp; This film, directed 
   and co-written by Herb Freed (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Haunts">HAUNTS</A></B>

    DAY</A></B> - 1981), clearly belongs to Seymour Cassel as an 
   over-the-hill hippie who has a hard time adjusting to modern day 
   society. The music soundtrack is full of classic 60s &amp; 70s tunes 
   like &quot;Louie, Louie&quot; (played during a chase between the bad 
   guys and Mike &amp; C.J.) and &quot;Lean On Me&quot; (during a 
   lovemaking session between Mike and C.J.), partly to convey Dr. 
   Dave's fragile state of mind (after all, he did name his daughter 
   &quot;Celestial Jewel&quot;, but she would much rather be called 
   &quot;C.J.&quot;). Those expecting a slam-bang serious actioner are 
   going to be bitterly disappointed, as most of the action scenes have 
   a comical tone. It's very clear to see that the acting gene doesn't 
   run in the Norris family (Mike, like father Chuck, is a better 
   martial artist than actor and when he looks into the camera, it's 
   like a deer caught in a car's headlights), but <B><A HREF="survival_game_1987b.htm">SURVIVAL

   Cassel is on-screen. Also starring Arlene Golonka (<B><A HREF="#TrainedToKill1988">TRAINED

   she dies. Jack then takes his best friend, Dr. Vincent Ryan (Cliff De 
   Young), and his nurse wife, Linda (Susan Blakely), out on the road 
   with him, in search of his son, who is away at summer camp. Jack is a 
   survivalist and has prepared himself for just such an occasion and he 
   will have to use this knowledge to fight bloodthirsty marauders, 
   mistrusting police and the relentless pursuit of Lt. Youngman and his 
   band of newly deputized men. Jack saves Vince and Linda from a 
   motorcycle gang, when they decide to leave Jack and head to the 
   nearest town to tend to the wounded (how cowardly of them!). After 
   Linda is nearly raped by the gang, they quickly change their minds 
   and stick with Jack. After running into a gun-toting wolf pack on the 
   side of the road, our trio stop at the house of kindly old timer Dub 
   Daniels (David Wayne), who feeds and gives them shelter for the 
   night. Vince has a falling-out with Jack and takes off in one of 
   Dub's old pickup trucks without Linda. Vince stupidly picks up a 
   couple of hitch-hikers, who kill him for his truck. After stopping 
   for a night of doing the mattress dance in an abandoned motel, Jack 
   and Linda must face off against Lt. Youngman and his biker pals. This 
   all happens when Jack finally locates his young son. Youngman attacks 
   from the air, while the bikers take care of the ground assault. 
   Everything ends on a happy note (except for Lt. Youngman, who gets a 
   knife tracheotomy followed by a bullet chaser).&nbsp; Directed by the

   human moments, from Jack's search for his son, a town that refuses to 
   allow anyone it doesn't know to enter city limits, to Vince's 
   examination of Dub's cat, who is his only companion. That's not to 
   say there isn't plenty of violence and bloodshed. People are shot, 
   garrotted, stabbed, blown up and run over. The final assault on Jack, 
   his son and Linda is well-handed and suspenseful, with good stunts, 
   plenty of firepower and some creative deaths. This Reagan-era 
   depiction of paranoia, power, greed and loss is pretty good

   to Coscarelli's skills, the beautiful location photography and a

   walks of life take a prop plane yo a runway deep in the mountains,

    juvenile delinquent Gray (Dermot Mulroney; <B><A HREF="point_of_no_return_1993.htm">POINT
    OF NO RETURN</A></B> - 1993), who chose this class over spending

   the group, whether it's climbing walls, walking on rope bridges or 
   rappelling down trees, Hank's motto being &quot;no man (or woman) 
   left behind&quot;. Gray has trouble assimilating into the group, but 
   Hank and the rest of the participants try their damnedest to make him 
   feel at ease. Their teamwork is about to be put to the test when a 
   rival group, part of the Blue Legion Survival School, run by the 
   extremely cruel Jake Connor (Mark Rolston; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HumanoidsFromDeep96">HUMANOIDS

   practice, first by using harmless paint guns, but graduating to 
   deadlier tactics as the film progresses, especially after Gray stop 
   Raider (Steve Antin), Jake's top student, from harassing the elderly 
   Hal. As Hank and his group trek through the woods, living off the 
   land (such as eating earthworms) and growing closer to each other, 
   not only as a team, but also as friends, Jake and his group make life 
   difficult for them, first by destroying a rope bridge, forcing Hank 
   and his group to make a dangerous detour over a snow-covered 
   mountain, nearly freezing to death in the process. When a demented 
   Raider shoots Hank and then slits Jake's throat, making it look like 
   Hank and Jake killed each other, Hank's team are hunted down by 
   Raider and the rest of the Blue Legion team, only this time they have 
   automatic weapons with live ammo. The Survival Quest group must 
   muster all of their teamwork to survive, but it turns out Hank and 
   Jake are not quite dead, as Hank teaches Jake the real meaning of 
   survival while the two opposing teams duke it out in the woods and 
   over the white rapids of a raging river. Watch out for that 
   waterfall!&nbsp; This action adventure film is a detour from what we 
   have come to expect from Coscarelli. Sure, there is violence to be 
   found here (although the majority of it doesn't happen until the 
   final third), but this film is more about human relationships and 
   bonding during difficult times than anything else (Or, as Hank says 
   to Jake when he and his team illegally shoot a deer with automatic 
   weapons; &quot;Survival in the wilderness is a matter of heart, not 
   hardware.&quot;). The simple fact is this: Rather than going the easy 
   route and making this just another bloodbath in the woods, Coscarelli 
   took the harder route and wrote a screenplay with well-rounded 
   characters that the audience can identify with and, not surprisingly, 
   the film works much better because of it. <B><A HREF="survival_quest_1989d.htm">SURVIVAL

   - 1988), Bradley's grandson (who is also a Vietnam vet, an architect 
   and an accomplished swordsman), decides to find out what really 
   happened to his grandfather since his body was never found. With the 
   help of a military information officer named Billie (Judy Green; <B><A HREF="get_the_terrorist_1987.htm">GET
    THE TERRORISTS</A></B> - 1987), Zac is able to pinpoint the location 
   in South Thailand where his grandfather's body is probably buried.

   heads to the jungles of Thailand with a native guide named Udom 
   (Prasert Khunthongchandra) and within a couple of days they find the 
   rusted wreckage of Bradley Connor's downed plane and soon the 
   headless skeleton of his body nearby. Before Zac can celebrate his

   who kill all the bandits. Suay takes Zac back to her village, only to 
   discover that bandits have destroyed the village and nearly everyone 
   has been killed, including the children and Suay's mother. Zac stays 
   to help rebuild the village and Suay begins to show a romantic 
   interest in him (&quot;He's a different kind of American.&quot;), 
   which doesn't sit too well with Chai, who challenges Zac to a fight. 
   Both are evenly matched in martial arts skills, but Zac wins because 
   Chai is too emotional. Zac confides in Suay that he is looking for a 
   katana sword that his grandfather stole from Japan just before his 
   plane crashed in the jungle. The sword, known as the &quot;Hand Of 
   The Goddess Of Mercy&quot;, is a Japanese treasure and Zac considers 
   it his duty to find the sword and return it to Japan. Zac learns from 
   Suay that there is a legend of a WWII Japanese soldier living in a 
   cave in the mountains, so Zac hires drunken American expatriate Gerry 
   (Jim Simmonds) to guide him, Suay and Chai to the cave. When they 
   arrive at the cave, Zac finds the sword, along with the corpse of the 
   Japanese soldier who killed his grandfather (he killed himself in a 
   ritualistic suicide over the shame of killing of Lt. Connors). Gerry 
   turns bad guy, steals the sword, kills Chai and runs into the cave, 
   only to be killed himself by an old Japanese booby trap that causes a 
   cave-in. Zac and Suay must find an alternate route of escape (which 
   they do) and then they head to the Japan Embassy to return the sword 
   and collect a $2,000,000 reward. Easier said than done, since a 
   Japanese creep named Yamaguchi (Toshishiro Obata; <B><A HREF="showdown_in_little_tokyo_1991.htm">SHOWDOWN
    IN LITTLE TOKYO</A></B> - 1991) sends some ninjas to steal the sword 
   before Zac can deliver it. When Yamaguchi kidnaps Suay, Zac must find 
   a way to rescue her and still return the sword to the Embassy. Expect 
   plenty of slicing and dicing before this fight is over.&nbsp; This is 
   a decent Thailand-lensed action adventure that is equal parts martial 
   arts actioner, jungle adventure and crime drama. Director Adrian Carr (<B><A HREF="mind_games_2003.htm">MIND
    GAMES</A></B> - 2003, also starring Norton) and screenwriter James 
   Wulf Simmonds (who shortened his name to &quot;Jim Simmonds&quot; to 
   essay the role of Gerry) keeps the film moving at a brisk pace by 
   constantly shifting gears and changing the direction of the plot. 
   Richard Norton is also given just enough screen time to show off his 
   martial arts skills as well as his skills at bedding women. Norton 
   may not be a good actor here (but, to be fair, he got better as the 
   years and films rolled by), but he does have enough goofy charm to 
   carry a film on his broad shoulders. What other action star do you 
   know that could pull-off stealing a kid's miniature go-kart and give 
   chase to the bad guys (who have kidnapped Suay) through the streets 
   of Bangkok and not make it look ridiculous? Can you imagine Seagal or

   Cleopatra Wong (Marrie Lee) is a globe-trotting Interpol agent who is 
   an expert martial artist and marks(wo)man. She travels from Manila to 
   Singapore to investigate a money counterfeiting ring, which has been 
   distributing phony bills all over the Far East. Cleo sets herself up 
   as a counterfeiter by paying for some expensive jewelry with bogus 
   money and getting herself arrested. Argo, the local kingpin of the 
   counterfeiting ring, bails her out of jail and has his goons bring 
   her to his mansion. When Cleo tells him the truth (that she's an 
   Interpol agent sent to catch him), he doesn't believe her (!), so he 
   has three brawny wrestlers try to beat her up. When they fail, Argo 
   brings out dozens of kung-fu fighters, but Cleo escapes (she jumps to 
   the top of a twenty foot wall with one leap!) and leads the bad guys 
   on a chase through Singapore, stopping every now and then to beat the 
   stuffing out of Argo's <A HREF="they_call_her_cleopatra_wong_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cleopatra wong german poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="245" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>men.
    Cleo captures Argo and his information leads her to Hong Kong, where 
   she follows a truck filled with crates of strawberry jam that are 
   concealing plastic bags filled with funny money. Cleo gets caught by 
   the crew on the truck, forcing her to kick the shit out of them (one 
   guy falls off a cliff). This leads Cleo back to Manila, where she 
   disguises herself as a reporter for &quot;Asian Weekly&quot; and 
   questions workers at a strawberry farm. This information takes her to 
   a Catholic monastary (!). She takes photos of the monastary and 
   notices a helicopter parked on the front lawn. Three thugs go to 
   Cleo's apartment and try to steal the negatives, but she shoots and 
   kills them all. Cleo and four hand-picked men assault the monastary, 
   armed with guns, bows and a high-tech shotgun, just as five of the 
   biggest heads of crime syndicates are holding a meeting there. 
   Disguising themselves as nuns, Cleo and her gang enter the monastary 
   and save all the real nuns, who are being held prisoner in the 
   basement. After getting the nuns to safety (the head nun gives them 
   her blessing to return to the monastary to kick ass!), Cleo and her 
   men clean house, killing all the bad guys. Cleo hops on her 
   tricked-out motorcycle (with hidden machine guns) and dishes out

   Richardson&quot;, is a light comical tale that's heavy on the martial 
   arts, but shys away from showing any real graphic bloodshed or 
   carnage. Most of the time, when people are shot, it's all bloodless 
   (there are some bloody bullet squibs in the finale, but nothing too 
   graphic). I did like Cleo's choice of men to go with her on the 
   monastary assault, as they are all veterans of Filipino cinema. They 
   include George (George Estregan), Dante (Dante Varona), Alex (Alex 
   Pecante) and Ben (Franco Guerrero, here billed as &quot;Chico 
   Guerrero&quot;). It's hard to watch a Philippines-lensed action film 
   made during the late 70's and 80's and not see at least one of these 
   four gentlemen appear in it. Like I said before, the majority of the 
   film carries a comical tone (nuns with moustaches; the head bad guy 
   at the monastary is called &quot;Mr. Monk&quot;), so don't go into 
   this expecting something like the hardcore action of <B><A HREF="#Final Score">FINAL
    SCORE</A></B> (1986) or <B><A HREF="#DeathRaiders1984">DEATH RAIDERS</A></B> 
   (1984), because you will be severely disappointed. This is more in 
   line with PG-rated fare, as the action is cartoonish and broad and 
   there is no nudity and very little foul language. Once you understand 
   this, you may find yourself liking this goofy little film, especially 
   when you hear dialogue like, &quot;Freeze, or you're a dead nun!&quot;

   night Tom is found dead, a shiv sticking out of his chest and a 
   crumpled piece of paper clenched in his fist (which is a letter of 
   introduction to King Cobra). Pang is released from prison and is 
   promptly picked up by men of the casino owner's rival and is driven 
   to his house, where the mobster offers Pang ten times the money the 
   casino owner offered him for the information of King Cobra's 
   whereabouts. Before Pang can answer, another rival gang breaks up the 
   meeting, a fight ensues and Pang gets away. Pang patiently waits for 
   his payment of $10,000, but is betrayed when the casino owner sends a 
   hitman to kill him after he gets the info on King Cobra's location. 
   Pang kills the hitman instead and becomes wanted by every crime 
   syndicate in the area because only he knows where King Cobra can be 
   found. After getting into a fight in a whorehouse, Pang heads to the 
   town where King Cobra is staying, where he meets a wealthy mine owner 
   and his beautiful daughter (Prichela Lee). Pang becomes the mine's 
   foreman, as well as the daughter's paramour, and foils an attempt to 
   sabotage the mine (which leads to a fight atop a dam) and kidnap the 
   daughter. The casino owner sends a hitwoman to kidnap Pang's brother, 
   which she does, and will only release him when Pang finds King Cobra 
   (who is now known as &quot;Wang Pu&quot;) and turns him over to her 
   (It seems Wang Pu killed the hitwoman's parents years earlier. Wow, 
   this is getting confusing!). Pang finally meets Tom's brother at the 
   coffee shop and hands him the letter of introduction. Pang then meets 
   King Cobra, who has been hiding out in a cave (!), and Pang must 
   defend his life (It turns out King Cobra once saved Pang's life. Now 
   I'm really confused!) when members from all the crime syndicates 
   flood the town and try to kill King Cobra. How the hell is all this 
   going to turn out? It has something to do with a hidden princess and 
   a secret list of names of undercover agents.&nbsp; Although the plot 
   of this film (also known as <B><A HREF="magnum_killers_1976.htm">MAGNUM
    KILLERS</A></B> and <B><A HREF="karate_tiger_1976.htm">KARATE TIGER</A></B>)
    is much too confusing to follow, director Vichien Sa-Nguanthai (who 
   directed <B><A HREF="#DirtyHeroes1979">DIRTY HEROES</A></B> [1979] 
   using the name &quot;Vachien Sakon&quot;) and the uncredited 
   screenwriter(s) offer plenty of awkwardly-staged fighting scenes 
   (Pang uses his legs more than his arms and fists when he gets into 
   his many scrapes, which is probably why this is titled <B>TIGER FIGHTING</B>)
    and bloody violence (including neck-snapping, bloody stabbings and 
   impalements) to keep the viewer occupied. The hilariously bad English 
   dubbing (the dubbers have a hard time deciding if the lead 
   character's name is &quot;Pan&quot; or &quot;Pang&quot;) will have 
   you roaring with laughter at the absurdities of the dialogue (&quot;My
    heart has chosen to guard you!&quot;), as well as voices that don't 
   match the actors (pay close attention to the gay owner of the 
   whorehouse). <B>TIGER FIGHTING</B> also contains a cockfighting 
   scene; a motorcycle that spits-out red smoke; torture by red-hot 
   poker (that looks surprisingly real) and meat hook (a graphic 
   effect); and a bit of female nudity that is creative for the way it 
   manages to show nothing obscene (all her naughty bits are hidden 
   behind a bathroom sink). Nothing earth-shattering, but a fun film 
   nonetheless. Also starring Boosith, Viboonlap, Anant-Choinanich and 
   Somkiat-Phranpriyachet. Released overseas by Joseph Lai's IFD Films 
   (although Lai's name doesn't appear on the credits). Originally 
   released on VHS in the U.S. by <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Unicorn">Unicorn

    official Colonel Barro (Vic Silayan; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightCobraWoman">NIGHT
    OF THE COBRA WOMAN</A></B> - 1972). Tava beats the crap out of 
   Barro's men a short time later when they follow him out of the 
   airport (Tava sports a fake leg cast to make him look like an easy 
   target), which pisses-off Barro to no end. It seems Colonel Barro has 
   kidnapped Karen and her friends to satisfy the lust of Vladimir 
   (Jaime Fabregas), a Russian arms dealer that is about to trade a huge 
   amount of weapons to Colonel Barro for a fortune in heroin. When 
   Tava, Cowboy and Tony show up unannounced at Madame Claude's, they 
   discover that they have missed saving the girls by mere minutes. 
   After beating-up a few more of Barro's men, the trio end up at an 
   illegal martial arts tournament, where Tava challenges Barro's 
   champion fighter, Ponsok (Roland Dantes), to a duel to the death 
   (where they are chained together and kick each other in the body and 
   head with metal blades attached to their feet) in exchange for Karen 
   and the other models. When Tava wins, Barro renegs on the deal and 
   tosses Tava a roughed-up Jan instead. Jan tells Tava that the models 
   have been transferred to a communist camp in the jungle, so Tava, 
   Cowboy and Tony gear-up (with a CO2-powered dartgun, a rapid-fire 
   crossbow and other weird weapons) and head for the camp, meeting 
   heavy resistance along the way (including an unfriendly cobra). The 
   finale finds our heroic trio assaulting the enemy camp, rescuing the 
   models (although one doesn't make it out alive), killing Colonel 
   Barro (Tava stabs him in the balls when he tries to rape Karen) and 
   striking a huge blow against communism.&nbsp; The biggest detriment 
   to this humorous action flick, directed by Emmett Alston; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#New Years Evil">NEW
    YEAR'S EVIL</A></B> - 1980; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Demonwarp">DEMONWARP</A></B> 
   - 1988), is the dreadful performance by lead Mike Stone (the brother 
   of actress Sharon Stone and considered by many to be in the same 
   league as Chuck Norris and Bruce lee as one of the pioneers of 
   American Karate), who also co-wrote the screenplay with Ivan Rogers (<B><A HREF="crazed_cop.htm">CRAZED
    COP</A></B> - 1986). Stone has the emotional range of, well, a 
   stone, and the film suffers when he is required to actually act. As 
   an action hero he's just fine; his martial arts skills are dandy, but 
   put him next to an established character actor like John Quade (in a 
   rare good guy role; he usually plays greasy scumbags or corrupt cops 
   and is probably best known as Cholla, the leader of the Black Widow

   element. The action here is plentiful and there is some graphic 
   violence (stabbings; the tournament fight; two guerillas shooting a 
   woman and a young boy in the back), but the majority of the violence 
   and pyrotechnics are saved for the finale, where our heroic trio 
   assaults the communist camp. There's also zero nudity, which is 
   strange considering the subject matter (Models and brothels and no 
   bare breasts? I'm deeply hurt.). Still, it's mindless fun if you can 
   get past the terrible performance of Mike Stone, who was also this 
   film's Fight Coordinator. Also starring Kasey Antonio, Jerry Bailey, 
   Eva Winnercrans, Jimmy Luspo, Taina Manigque and Pablo T. Manigque.

   mostly it's just martial arts fights. The print used for the Dollar 
   DVD release is a total mess. It looks like it had a long life running 
   through projectors as it has plenty of emulsion scratches and is 
   missing quite a few frames during reel changes. It's like you're

   80's, action films like this were a dime a dozen and I avoided them 
   like the plague whenever I went to the video store. The funny thing 
   is, over twenty years later, I'm eating these films up like they are 
   manna from Heaven. Why? I've asked myself that question many times 
   and the only reasonable answer I can come up with is that 80's action 
   films throw political correctness out the window. Terrorists are 
   sweaty Arab towelheads, drug lords are greasy Mexicans, pimps and 
   crackheads are Black men who slap their women around and government 
   officials are traitors actually working for our worst enemies. When 
   the 90's rolled in, so did the PC police and many action films 
   suffered because of it (there are exceptions, though) and many of the 
   bad guys became so vanilla, it was hard to tell them apart from each

   gunfights, car chases and martial arts battles. While the low budget 
   shows itself more than I care for (including numerous appearances of 
   the boom mike at the top of the screen, although this could be 
   because the film is shown &quot;open matte&quot;), this film has an 
   infectious energy that's hard to deny. Sure, it's a cheap B-actioner 
   (and, yes, it does contain topless female nudity), but it's an 
   entertaining one with the right mixture of humor, drama, violence and 
   action. You can do a lot worse (and I have). Kane Hodder puts in an

   desert of the Middle East, a British military outpost is living 
   peacefully with the local Muslim military and villagers. Lt. Rashid 
   (Anthony Alonzo; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#BloodWar1989">BLOOD WAR</A></B> 
   - 1989) is assigned by his superiors to drive American reporter 
   Leslie Prentiss (Nanna Anderson) around so she can take photos of the 
   area. Lt. Rashid doesn't think this is any place for a woman and just 
   as he makes his feelings known to her, the whole military base comes 
   under attack by rebel forces, leading to a heated battle (lots of 
   shots in the head and objects exploding). When the smokes clears, the 
   British come out the winners and Leslie and Rashid look like they are 
   about to make a romantic connection. We then switch to the Kremlin, 
   where we watch some fat and balding guy named Abu Hassad (Ed Gaerlan) 
   banging a poor boys asshole (!) before some Russian guy interrupts 
   him with a briefcase full of cash and a plane ticket (What they are 
   to be used for is not yet made clear). We then switch to Malaysia, 
   where a woman dressed head-to-toe in black leather hops on a 
   motorcycle, drives into the middle of an<A HREF="trident_force_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/trident force vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   open-air caf&eacute; and triggers a bomb on her body, killing herself 
   and the majority of the people in the caf&eacute;. We then switch to 
   the Israeli Ambassador's residence in Beirut, where we watch a pair 
   of hooded terrorists savagely gun-down the Ambassador (Paul Holme; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Spyder1988">SPYDER</A></B> 
   - 1988), his wife and two young kids as they are eating dinner. We 
   then learn that all these attacks were coordinated by the dastardly 
   Abu Hassad, who heads a terrorist organization called the Palestine 
   Revolutionary Legion. Lt. Rashid joins a top-secret group called the 
   Trident Organization to combat Hassad and the PRL (we also find out 
   that Leslie is a CIA operative), but first all the members of the 
   newly-formed Trident Force (which contains men from all cultures and 
   religions) must go through a rigorous training program (I smell an 80's-style
    training montage!) before they can be put into the field. Rashid 
   makes an instant enemy in Training Officer Ox (Nick Nicholson, also 
   the Casting Director), who calls Rashid such epithets as 
   &quot;camel-humper&quot; and &quot;Sinbad&quot;, but Rashid turns out 
   to be the best of the best and Ox turns out to be a pretty decent guy 
   after all. The Trident Force is set loose on the PRL, but 
   complications quickly arise when we discover Rashid's brother, Ahmed 
   (Mark Gil) is working undercover in the PRL. Abu Hassad discovers the 
   treachery and mails Ahmed's decapitated head in a box to Rashid. Oh 
   man, all bets are off now! I think we're going to see at least one 
   more person lose their head before this film concludes.&nbsp; Way 
   more plot-heavy and complex than the usual Filipino actioner, <B><A HREF="trident_force_1987b.htm">TRIDENT
    FORCE</A></B> plays more like a low-budget riff of <B><A HREF="dirty_dozen_1967.htm">THE
    DIRTY DOZEN</A></B> (1965), replacing the prisoners in <B>DIRTY</B> 
   with the best combat professionals from around the world, including 
   America (Jim Moss), China (Tony Lao), Spain (Carlos Terry), France 
   (Gerald Tosco), Germany (Rafael Schulz) and other countries. The 
   complex storyline (the opening credits don't appear until 18 minutes 
   in!), by screenwriters Rosanno Abelardo and Sigfried Sepulveda (Joe 
   Mari Avellana gets a &quot;Story By&quot; credit), follows a three 
   tier approach: 1) Display the PRL's terror tactics around the world. 
   2) Introduce all the members of the Trident Force and put them 
   through their paces (including personal dramas). 3) Unleash the 
   Trident Force on Abu Hassad and the PRL. Director &quot;Richard 
   Smith&quot; (actually a pseudonym for female producer Maria Sarrett) 
   offers the viewer plenty of violence, as people are riddled with 
   bullets (a lot of them in the skull region), Leslie is tortured with 
   a stun gun, plenty of people and buildings explode and the final 
   fifteen minutes is a non-stop barrage of death and destruction. This 
   may not be one of the best Filipino actioners I've seen, but it 
   contains enough weirdness (including forced gay sex and Anthony 
   Alonzo preparing himself for final battle by shaving-off all his body 
   hair, including his pubes, with a knife!), bloody violence and strict 
   Muslim morals (that doesn't come across nearly as preachy as it does 
   in <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#KrisCommando">KRIS COMMANDO</A></B>

   help him find the cave where he hid the golden Buddha, he will split

   located in Cambodia and then he is shot dead by McMann's thugs. Since 
   Dave and James are broke and need money to go to Cambodia, Dave 
   enters himself in a fight against the Philippines' best martial 
   artist, Cobra Cole (Mike Cole), for a $20,000 purse. After winning

   female martial artist Julie Webb (Bridgett &quot;Baby Doll&quot;

   died in a car accident. Julie is not too happy to see Dave (they have

   leads to a fight-filled finale full of flying fists and feet, a gun 
   battle or two and plenty of explosions. Our trio are the only ones 
   who make it out alive, but they do so without the statue. Dave has a

   ninja war ensues, complete with sword fights, gun battles, bazookas

   and screenwriter Phil Behrens, who both worked in the same capacities 
   on the sequel, fill the film with wall-to-wall action, but some of 
   the dialogue and set pieces are risible and outlandish, such as when

   the Scarlet Leader's constant need for quoting lines from <B><A HREF="wizard_of_oz.htm">THE

   trespassing ninjas.&quot; The fights and action sequences are all 
   very well choreographed and executed and the set direction,

    Giorgio (Merenda; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#KidnapSyndicate">KIDNAP
    SYNDICATE</A></B> - 1975) is a no-nonsense cop recently transferred 
   to Milan after getting into some unknown trouble in another Italian 
   city. He also has trouble keeping friends, as they usually end up 
   dead because of criminals with no respect for the law. One such 
   friend, a local cop who is transporting three violent criminals by 
   train, is killed when one of the criminals, Casardi (Antonio Casale, 
   as &quot;Anthony Vernon&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WhatDoneSolange1972">WHAT
    HAVE YOU DONE TO SOLANGE?</A></B> - 1972), tells another cop he has 
   to pee, so he leads him to the bathroom, only for Casardi to pull out 
   a knife he had hidden in his crotch, and stab the cop to death, 
   stealing his gun. Casardi then shoots and kills Giorgio's friend and 
   releases the other two criminals, including Cruciani (personal 
   favorite <A HREF="luciano_rossi_films_on_amazon_prime.htm">Luciano Rossi</A>;
    <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DeathSmilesMurder73">DEATH SMILES ON A MURDERER</A></B> 
   - 1973), but the third criminal gets shot in the back and dies, as 
   Casardi and Cruciani jump off the train and escape. We then see the 
   two crooks stop a car and kill the driver, stealing the car with the 
   driver's seven-year-old daughter still in the car. As the girl begins 
   to cry and she won't stop, Casardi tells Cruciani to kill the girl 
   (in a very tense scene). We then see Giorgio examining the stolen 
   car, the dead body of the young girl still inside. A radio call comes 
   in saying that the two criminals are trapped in the woods and Giorgio 
   goes there, telling the other cops to give them a minute to give 
   themselves up, while he circles around them. As Casardi and Cruciani 
   get into a gunfight with the cops, they can see that they are 
   outnumbered and there is no escape, so they give themselves up, still 
   holding on to their machine guns. Giorgio shows up behind them and 
   orders them to drop their guns. When they don't do it fast enough, 
   Giorgio shoots and kills them both, some cops saying he killed them 
   in cold blood, but Giorgio doesn't care, telling his superior (and 
   friend) Gianni (Silvano Tranquilli; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Slasher1972">THE
    SLASHER...IS THE SEX MANIAC!</A></B> - 1971) that Casardi and 
   Cruciani were already lifers, so what could the courts do to them for 
   killing a little girl and her father? He did Italy a favor by killing 
   them. Gianni tells Giorgio that his actions could get him kicked off 
   the force, but he will do all he can to make sure that doesn't 
   happen. Gianni has been working on a series of high-money bank 
   robberies all over town that has him stumped and suggests to Giorgio 
   that he help him on the case.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A short time later, Giorgio's boss, Captain Del Buono (Chris Avram; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BayOfBlood1971">A
    BAY OF BLOOD</A></B> - 1971), is murdered on the street by an 
   assassin who walks up to him and shoots him point blank. Giorgio 
   promises Del Buono's wife (Valeria Sabel; <B><A HREF="baron_blood_1972.htm">BARON
    BLOOD</A></B> - 1972) that he will catch her husband's killer to 
   make sure he gets the justice he deserves, but Gianni tells him that 
   he's been kicked off the force for using excessive force. Giorgio 
   decides to continue his investigation as a civilian, using his 
   experience as a cop to get to the bottom of why his Captain was 
   killed and who is the mastermind behind the bank robberies. What 
   Giorgio discovers is quite unusual, especially the reason why Del 
   Buono was killed and why banks are being robbed (they are related). A 
   reason ripped from Italy's history from that time period.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Giorgio starts his investigation by robbing a nameless prostitute 
   (Lia Tanzi; Martino's <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SuspicDeathMinor75">THE
    SUSPICIOUS DEATH OF A MINOR</A></B> - 1975) and beating up her 
   husband/pimp, Pepi (Rosario Borelli; <B><A HREF="loaded_guns_1975.htm">LOADED
    GUNS</A></B> - 1975), and telling him that he's his wife's pimp now! 
   (He also takes Pepi's car! Doing so gets his face known around town). 
   He then enters the Jolly Club, a poolhall known to be the place where 
   crime kingpin Padulo (Richard Conte; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Possessor1975">THE
    POSSESSOR</A></B> - 1975) hangs out. Giorgio starts intentionally 
   losing at the game of pool (When one of the pool players tells 
   Giorgio that he will lose his shirt, Giorgio tells him, &quot;I have 
   plenty of shirts!&quot;), just so he can get into a fight with the 
   tough guys and to prove to Padulo that he can handle himself. After 
   coming out the winner, Giorgio introduces himself to Padulo and 
   offers his services as a getaway driver, telling Padulo that he will 
   find no one better, but Padulo tells him his motto is &quot;Flying 
   Low&quot; (as in &quot;off the radar&quot;, his favorite saying) and 
   someone like Giorgio would get him exposure he doesn't need. Giorgio 
   starts a conversation with pretty girl Maria (Martine Brochard; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Eyeball1975">EYEBALL</A></B> 
   - 1975), the girlfriend of Giacomo (Luciano Bartoli; <B><A HREF="fifth_cord_1971.htm">THE
    FIFTH CORD</A></B> - 1971), one of Padulo's hoods. They leave the 
   poolhall together and Padulo tells his two best hoods (portrayed by 
   Claudio Ruffini [<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#MeanFrank1973">MEAN 
   FRANK AND CRAZY TONY</A></B> - 1973] and Sergio Smacchi [<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#MadDog1977">MAD
    DOG</A></B> - 1977]) to follow them. Giorgio steals an old classic 
   car and takes Maria to a restaurant, where she tells him her life 
   story (He ends up calling her &quot;Maria Ex&quot;, because she quits 
   everything she starts, never completing it [such as high school]). 
   After dinner, Maria invites Giorgio back to her place, but he becomes 
   disgusted when he discovers it is a squalid home for drug addicts and 
   prostitutes (Maria is both) that is nothing but a giant room with 
   dirty cots, where whores screw johns in front of everyone. Giorgio 
   walks out on Maria and loses the two goons following him (They think 
   he will spend the night with Maria, so there's no use waiting in the 
   cold for him). Padulo then sends three novice crooks, including 
   Giacomo, to rob a bank for him, with Giorgio as the getaway driver, 
   but when they rob the bank, one of the crooks shoots and kills a 
   pregnant woman in the stomach, which upsets Giorgio (and makes 
   Giacomo sick!) and he leads the police on a wild car chase throughout 
   the city of Milan. He drives the car right to the door of the police 
   station, but the cops shoot and kill all three bank robbers, making 
   Giorgio mad, telling them it was their only hope of solving who is 
   behind the robberies (Padulo is still untouchable). It seems the cops 
   are more trigger-happy than Giorgio, but no one is bringing them up 
   on charges because the robbers killed a pregnant woman (I guess an 
   unborn dead baby is more important than the life of a seven-year-old 
   girl, but, hey, this is justice, Italian style!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Long story short, Giorgio discovers that these bank robberies are 
   being committed to finance an anarchist organization that wants to 
   create chaos in Italy in order to &quot;build a new nation.&quot; It 
   turns out Padulo is not the head of this organization (telling 
   Giorgio that he's &quot;just a small cog in a very big wheel&quot;), 
   but Giorgio and Padulo get into a knock-down, drag-out fight (it is 
   obvious no stunt people were used in this fight), Giorgio telling 
   him, &quot;I'll hurt you so bad you'll wish mirrors were never 
   invented!&quot; The fight ends when Padulo falls down and hits his 
   head on the base of a marble statue, sending him to the hospital in a 
   coma. Giorgio becomes a wanted man, but he knows someone will come to 
   the hospital to try and kill Padulo just in case he does wake up. The 
   assassin who killed Captain Del Buono shows up in Padulo's hospital 
   room and disconnects his breathing tube, but Giorgio is hiding in the 
   room and a gunfight breaks out, Giorgio killing the assassin, but 
   ends up getting shot in the shoulder in the process (no one even 
   tries to reconnect Padulo's breathing tube, letting him die 
   instead!). Gianni once again pulls Giorgio's ass out of the fire, but 
   it becomes clear that Gianni is part of the anarchist organization 
   (Giorgio discovers one of Padulo's cigars in Gianni's ashtray), as he 
   asks Giorgio to join the organization because it needs a hero and 
   &quot;the people respect order only when you force them.&quot; 
   Giorgio agrees to join, but once he gets out of the hospital, he 
   tells Gianni no deal. This leads to a car chase between Gianni and 
   Giorgio, where Giorgio forces Gianni's car off the road and over an 
   embankment, where we watch the car do several rolls and Gianni dies. 
   Giorgio looks at his friend's bloody body, walks away and pulls his 
   gun from his belt, throwing it to the ground. THE END.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Merenda, who looks like he is having one helluva time here. His 
   stare with those stark eyes of his could melt glass and there's no 
   denying he has a presence. It's also easy to see why all women love 
   him in this film, even when he robs them (the unnamed prostitute) or 
   throws away the drugs they need to get high (Maria). A lot of actors 
   would have broadly played Giorgio, but Merenda adds just the right 
   amount of humor and pathos to make his role relatable to the audience 
   and not make him seem cartoonish. The violence level is also very 
   high in this film, as people are shot in the head or riddled with 
   bullets. I was worried they were going to show Luciano Rossi killing 
   the young girl, but Martino handles it in a way that still makes it 
   shocking without making it graphic. It's a highly intense scene that 
   will make you grasp the armrest of your chair in suspense and fear. 
   This film also has a lot of car chases and car stunts, more than I 
   have ever seen in a film in this genre. They are very well filmed (no 
   speeding up the film as most chases are) and are very involving. 
   Martino never fails to surprise me when it comes to his films. They 
   are very well photographed, acted and scripted, making them top-notch 
   entertainment for the masses out there who crave some plot with their 
   violence. Also look for various shots of <A HREF="j&amp;b_scotch_whiskey_in_italian_films.htm">J&amp;B

   normal relationship with his wife and son. Now, Ben will revert back 
   to his violent past to hunt down the crimelord and make him pay. And 
   make him pay hard. After making sure his son and the girl are safely 
   tucked away in a safehouse, Ben reconnects with his mobster cronies 
   and sets out to destroy the crimelord's life and businesses from the 
   bottom up. He takes out three guys at one of the crimelord's 
   whorehouses (he kills one of the guys who was present at his wife's 
   murder by blowing the top of his head off with a shotgun). Ben and 
   his cohorts torture the crooked INS agent with a power drill to get

   grab Ben's son and the girl from the safehouse. After a well-executed

   get the girl, but the bad guys get away with his son. Ben uses the 
   little girl as bait for a final showdown on a ship docked at the L.A.

   - 2003), the film moves at a brisk pace but doesn't lose it's 
   emotional center thanks to an eye-opening performance by Van Damme. 
   Age may have given him more wrinkles, but it has also given him more 
   character and it's apparent he cares about the quality of his work 
   (as opposed to most of Steven Seagal's recent work). Van Damme is 
   quite simply a revelation here as a committed husband who loses most 
   of his humanity once his wife dies. You can actually see it drain 
   from his face. The violence in this film is brutal. Not only are 
   people shot point-blank in the head, there's also shotgun deaths, 
   broken necks, the hard-to-watch power drill torture scene and the 
   bloody finale where Van Damme and his gangster brother assault the 
   ship (including a painful knife to the crotch). Although Van Damme 
   does let his feet do the talking in some scenes, he's equally at ease 
   with letting his gun finish off the bad guys, too. That's the true 
   sign that Van Damme is maturing not only as an actor, but also as a 
   human being. A man has to know his limitations and after watching him

   funeral, where Charles Stewart (Ted Earle) confronts his mother and 
   sister about his brother Rick's (Bill Redvers) death. Charles doesn't 
   believe that his brother is dead and is out to prove that Rick, who 
   disappeared during a top secret raid he participated in with his 
   brother in Vietnam years earlier, is still alive, despite a letter 
   his mother received from the government which states otherwise. We 
   then see a band of soldiers wipe out a town with gunfire when a 
   Spanish official and his daughter stop there to use the toilet and 
   get an ice cream cone. The soldiers graphically shoot everyone in 
   sight, including women and children. Charles gets in touch with 
   reporter Dean Daniels (Gunnar Ernblad) who, along with cameraman 
   Roger Hoover (David Gillies), took film footage of the town 
   slaughter. When both Dean and Roger are both savagely murdered (Dean 
   is shot repeatedly and then blown up with a<A HREF="wardogs_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wardogs vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   grenade, while Roger is garrotted out in public and left hanging on a 
   lightpole), Charles gets his hands on the footage and it shows 
   Charles' old Special Forces leader Spacek (Bengt Fridh) leading a 
   troop of top secret soldiers on the slaughter of the town and one of 
   the soldiers is his brother Rick. Charles is now a marked man, as 
   Spacek sends his &quot;WarDogs&quot; after him, nearly killing him at 
   a carnival and a restaurant, where many innocent people are 
   gunned-down. Charles is eventually captured by Spacek and tortured 
   with a metal hook to his chest and, after some hand-to-hand combat 
   with Spacek (where Charles loses), Charles escapes with the help of 
   his brother Rick, who has been fed a steady diet of experimental 
   drugs in an attempt to make him and those like him perfect killing 
   machines. Now, Charles and Rick must fight Spacek and his band of 
   chemically-altered soldiers. After Charles and Rick kill all the 
   soldiers and Spacek, Charles brings his brother home to meet his wife 
   Sheila and little son Ricky (named after his brother). The government 
   and Inspector Parnell (Sidney Livingstone) go after Rick, because 
   they feel he can never be cured. They are correct, as what happens 
   next at Charles' house is a slow-motion ballet of violence. Rick 
   snaps and Charles realizes that Rick was better left dead back in 
   Nam. You can never go home again.&nbsp; This insanely violent action 
   film is so bloody and without morals that it has no problem showing 
   innocent children getting blown away in painful-to-watch slow motion. Directors/producers/scripters
    Bjorn Carlstroem and Daniel Hubenbecher ladle on the bloody bullet 
   squibs. When someone gets shot, they don't just bleed, they explode 
   in a shower of blood. This plays like an ultra-low-budget version of <B><A HREF="universal_soldier_1992.htm">UNIVERSAL
    SOLDIER</A></B> (1992), made six years later (Hmmmm...), where 
   Charles saves his brother from a life as a &quot;perfect soldier&quot;
    and then being hunted down by the other soldiers before they can go 
   public with the secret. There are car chases (when Charles and Rick 
   try to escape in a Volvo, it is slowly torn apart piece-by-piece by 
   Spacek and his soldiers), explosions (too many grenades to count), 
   bullets to the head (ditto) and some people are literally torn apart 
   by gunfire. This is not a film for the faint of heart, especially if 
   you're squeamish about violence against children, as this flick pulls 
   no punches. The finale is a nail-biter and pits brother against nosy 
   neighbor, brother against brother, uncle against nephew and 
   government against soldier. All releases of this film are shorn of 
   the most violent images (it was cut by the producers in fear that no 
   one would release it in it's uncut form), but what's left will still 
   make every gorehound stand up and take notice. A German DVD, to be 
   released in late 2007/early 2008, promises to be the unedited print. 
   I will be the first online to buy it. When you think of Sweden, you 
   usually think of pretty blond-haired girls, not bloody, violent 
   films. But this film, along with Mats Helge's <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#NinjaMission">THE

   Grade Z actioners. Believe it or not, this one is worse than most as 
   there aren't even the frequent bloody bullet squibs that are usually 
   on view in Prior's films (When Tyler and Marcus shoot dozens of 
   people in the bank holdup, they all just drop to the floor and all 
   the furniture and the walls are undamaged). Everyone here dies nice, 
   dry deaths. Couple that with endless scenes of Danny's snowboarding

    CATS ATTACK!</A><A NAME="WildCatsAttack"></A> (1981) -</B> Here's a 
   rare misfire: A clumsily paced and somewhat boring Filipino war 
   actioner. A military base comes under attack by rebels, who steal a 
   red diary containing top-secret information before they retreat. Sgt. 
   Torez (Rey Malonzo; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Search Vengeance">SEARCH
    FOR VENGEANCE</A></B> - 1984) is one of the few survivors of the 
   rebel attack and becomes concerned when his girlfriend Perla (Leila 
   Hermosa; <B><A HREF="blind_rage_1978.htm">BLIND RAGE</A></B> - 1978), 
   who was visiting him at the base at the time of the attack, 
   disappears and is presumed dead. Sgt. Torez is promoted in rank to 
   Lieutenant and is given carte blanche to put together a team of his 
   choice to recover the red diary.&nbsp; He grabs a handful of people, 
   all experts in their field, including a demolitions expert on death 
   row for murder; an Army sharpshooter; a macho man who only has a few 
   weeks left to serve; and an AWOL soldier who is good with a crossbow. 
   The quintet's mission is to sneak into the mountain compound 
   commandeered by the ruthless Commander Commandant (!) and his force 
   of 250 rebels (Fifty-to-one? That's a mighty steep ratio!) and steal 
   back the red diary. Well, they can forget about sneaking in, because 
   as soon as Lt. Torez and his men parachute into enemy territory, they 
   get into a<A HREF="wild_cats_attack_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wild cats attack dutch vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="264" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   firefight with some rebels, who radio-in to the Commander and let 
   them know of their presence. The Commander makes it known in no 
   uncertain terms that the five invaders are in no way welcome in his 
   compound alive, so Lt. Torez and his men must contend with constant 
   enemy gunfire and traitorous villagers as they fight their way to the 
   compound. Lt. Torez still has time to contemplate the fate of his 
   girlfriend Perla and has flashbacks to past conversations with her 
   (clues which leads the audience to believe she may not be as innocent 
   as Lt. Torez believes she is). Torez and his men make it to the 
   compound and kill Commander Commandant, only to discover that the red 
   diary isn't there. It's now in the possession of one Commander 
   Sancho, which now means Lt. Torez and his men will have to go 
   undercover as political activists sent to prison in order to trick 
   the only person able to get close to Commander Sancho to break out of 
   prison and lead them to the red diary. War is never easy, is it? 
   Especially when your girlfriend turns out to be a total enemy 
   bitch.&nbsp; This early Kinevista International production (I had a 
   good laugh when the opening credits states: &quot;Kinevista

   - 1986) and scripted by Clem Santiago (also the Line Producer), is 
   full of lazily-staged action set-pieces and bad English dubbing 
   (&quot;Sir, I have to go over there to hit the head!&quot;). While 
   there are a lot of bloody bullet squib effects, the majority of the 
   shooting victims merely grab their head or chest when shot, which 
   cheapens the effectiveness of some of the battle scenes (Surely Lt. 
   Torez and his men don't deliver head and chest shots on every kill? 
   Or are they just that good?). That's not to say that there aren't 
   some decent action scenes on display. The attack on Commander 
   Commandant's compound contains some good slow-motion scenes of 
   grenades being thrown and blowing up their targets, resulting in some 
   nifty explosions. Unfortunately, right after that sequence the film 
   stops dead in it's tracks and takes forever to recover, thanks to the 
   film's new direction where Lt. Torez and his men go undercover as 
   prisoners to infiltrate Commander Sancho's compound. It takes nearly 
   thirty minutes for the action to kick in, an eternity to viewers when 
   all you have to entertain you is some hilarious dubbing (&quot;It's 
   dangerous if they find the body. Let's hide it&quot; and one of Lt. 
   Torez's men singing &quot;Camptown Races&quot; before attacking 
   Sancho's compound.). Bad dubbing only goes so far and thirty minutes 
   without a single death is stretching it to the limit. The 
   &quot;surprise&quot; ending, where a certain female is revealed as 
   the enemy ringmaster, is telegraphed early on. Oh, and did I forget 
   to mention that the theme music from <B><A HREF="raiders_of_the_lost_ark_1981.htm">RAIDERS
    OF THE LOST ARK</A></B> (1981) is &quot;borrowed&quot; for the

   actioners, but <B><A HREF="wild_cats_attack_1981b.htm">WILD CATS ATTACK!</A></B>

   sickly Dr. Johnson (Filipino staple Mike Monty) has his yacht boarded

   Romero assigns his best man, Lt. Valdez (Yusuf Salim), to rescue the

    is killed. This pisses-off head kidnapper Ernesto (a.k.a. &quot;The 
   Commander&quot;), who kills some innocent people and dumps their 
   bodies, along with a cassette tape, in the town square for everyone 
   to see. On the tape, Ernesto demands not only the two million 
   dollars, but also a huge cache of automatic weapons and thousands of 
   rounds of ammunition, or else he will kill his two captives. With 
   only five days to perform the rescue, Lt. Valdez gathers four of his 
   former squad members (which includes Benny, Nick, Danny and Hercules, 
   who lives in a foxhole!) to help him, but when Colonel Romero forces 
   Valdez to bring a female officer, Sgt. Jennifer, along for the 
   rescue, some members smell a rat. The newly formed squad, codenamed 
   The Wild Force (which now also includes black marketer Kimoporo), 
   follows a clue which leads the to the palatial estate of Alfredo 
   Montoya. This leads to a shootout with some of the kidnappers, where 
   Lt. Valdez and two other squad members are arrested by the local 
   police and locked-up in the local jail. Since they have to remain 
   undercover, they are unable to reveal their true identities to the 
   police, so Kimoporo, the crazy member of the squad (he walks around 
   dressed in nothing but a kimono), breaks them out of jail. Working on 
   a clue they got from Montoya before he was killed, the Wild Force 
   hops a ride on a helicopter and land in the jungle. They are welcomed 
   by a squad of gunfire-happy kidnappers who seem to have been 
   expecting their arrival. Is it possible that there is a traitor in 
   their ranks or is it all just a coincidence? I'm afraid you'll have 
   to watch the film to find out.&nbsp; While not as action-packed or 
   explosion-heavy as most Filipino actioners of the period, 
   director/screenwriter Frances &quot;Jun&quot; Posadas (<B><A HREF="they_call_him_bruce_lee_1979.htm">THEY
    CALL HIM BRUCE LEE</A></B> - 1979; <B><A HREF="#WildCatsAttack">WILD 
   CATS ATTACK!</A></B> - 1981) manages to hold the viewer's attention 
   thanks to some bloody shootouts and comedy relief, usually at the 
   expense of Kimoporo, who can't seem to keep his kimono on and exposes 
   his naked ass on one occasion. He also tries to sell members of his 
   squad fake gold jewelry (apparently fake gold turns black when you 
   dunk it in vinegar) every chance he gets. While <B><A HREF="wild_force_1986c.htm">WILD
    FORCE</A></B> may lack the excitement level of it's brethren, it 
   does contain some unusual set pieces to distinguish itself, such as 
   the scene where Kimoporo, whose knee has been shattered by enemy 
   gunfire, commits suicide by throwing himself off a cliff so he 
   doesn't slow down the rest of his squad, who want to carry him, but 
   he knows that if they do, they will not reach Dr. Johnson in time. 
   While the film does drag in spots, it conveys enough heart and soul 
   between the squad members (especially between Hercules and Kimoporo), 
   as well as scenes of female nudity (most notably when Barbara is 
   gang-raped by three kidnappers), torture and gun violence to keep 
   audiences entertained. It may not be one of the better Filipino 
   action films, but I have seen much worse. Also starring Robert Talby, 
   Danny Riel, Ben Morro, Nick Alladin, Hasmin Hassan and Roy Flores.

   various Philippines locations (including a slow-motion cockfight; a

   us plenty of women in various states of undress (there's no way in

   in the early 70's (yeah, I'm old) with the John Ashley flick <B><A HREF="beyond_atlantis_1973.htm">BEYOND
    ATLANTIS</A></B> on a fun double bill. Good times that most kids 
   today will sadly never experience. Also starring Joonee Gamboa, Gail 
   Hansen and Eleanor Siron. Originally available on VHS by <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Media Home Ent.">Media
    Home Entertainment</A> and not available on DVD, although it's 
   available on VHS &amp; DVD-R from <A HREF="http://www.somethingweird.com">Something
    Weird Video</A> for $10.00. <B>Rated PG</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>
