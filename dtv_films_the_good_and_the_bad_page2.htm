     TOMAHAWK</A></B> (2015) is one of those rare films: A Western with 
    horror trappings. To say it's gory as hell is a vast understatement. 
    The film opens with two bushwhackers, Buddy (the late Sid Haig; <B><A HREF="#ThreeFromHell2019">3
     FROM HELL</A></B> - 2019) and Purvis (David Arquette; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Tripper2006">THE
     TRIPPER</A></B> - 2006) slicing the throats of two sleeping settlers 
    and then stealing their belongings. Purvis didn't cut one of 
    settler's throat deep enough, but Buddy kills him, as the settler 
    gets off a shot with his pistol. The noise of the gunshot raises the 
    attention of the other settlers, so Buddy and Purvis <A HREF="bone_tomahawk_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/bone tomahawk dutch dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="215" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>beat
     a hasty retreat on foot and come across a strange Indian graveyard. 
    They then hear a strange howling noise (a high-pitched whistling 
    noise that will chill you to the bone) and Buddy is brutally killed 
    (an arrow to his throat and then something very, very gory) by a 
    weird tribe of Indians. Purvis escapes the carnage and ends up in the 
    town of Bright Hope, where he buries the settlers' belongings and 
    then goes to the local saloon. What Purvis doesn't know is backup 
    Deputy Chicory (a wonderful Richard Jenkins; <B><A HREF="shape_of_water_2017.htm">THE
     SHAPE OF WATER</A></B> - 2017) saw what Purvis did and reports it to 
    Sheriff Franklin Hunt (a grizzled Kurt Russell; <B><A HREF="death_proof_2007.htm">DEATH
     PROOF</A></B> - 2007; who has never been better) and they both go to 
    the saloon to question the stranger. Sheriff Hunt asks Purvis his 
    name and he says &quot;Buddy&quot;, but the Sheriff doesn't believe 
    him, showing Purvis the goods he buried. Purvis tries to run away, 
    but Sheriff Hunt shoots him in the leg and locks him in the town 
    jail.&nbsp; Samantha (Lili Simmons; the fantastic cable series <B><A HREF="banshee_tv_series_2013.htm">BANSHEE</A></B> 
    - 2013-2016), the town doctor, is called in to take a look at Purvis' 
    leg and remove the bullet (extremely gory footage). Samantha's 
    husband, Arthur (Patrick Wilson; <B><A HREF="ledge_2011.htm">THE </A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="ledge_2011.htm">LEDGE</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"> 
    - 2011) recently broke his tibia when he fell off the roof of his 
    house trying to repair it, and he loves Samantha with all his heart. 
    You may be asking yourself why I am describing what may seem 
    trivial&nbsp; matters, but take my word for it, everything in this 
    film is important down to the minutest details. When Sheriff Hunt 
    leaves Samantha and Deputy Nick (Evan Jonigkeit) to keep an eye on 
    Purvis so he can catch some sleep, he doesn't know that these strange 
    Indians have followed Purvis into Bright Hope, which results in 
    Samantha, Deputy Nick and Purvis&nbsp; being taken prisoner by the 
    Indians and brought back to the cave where they live. The next 
    morning, Sheriff Hunt finds a strange arrow inside his jail and a 
    local Indian tells the Sheriff that the arrow belongs to a tribe of 
    Indians known as &quot;Troglodytes&quot; and he knows where they 
    live, but refuses to go with him to rescue Samantha and Deputy Nick, 
    because just seeing a Troglodyte means certain death, as they are not 
    only ruthless killers, they are also cannibals! The whole town is 
    chickenshit after hearing this and the only people who will help 
    Sheriff Hunt on this rescue mission are Chicory, Arthur (broken leg 
    and all) and the nattily dressed Brooder (Matthew Fox; <B><A HREF="extinction_2014.htm">EXTINCTION</A></B> 
    - 2014), a gunslinger who has a severe hatred of Indians (when he was 
    young, he saw a tribe of Indians murder his mother and sister, so he 
    has killed over one hundred Indians, whether they deserved it or 
    not). These four people make a five day ride to the Troglodytes' 
    territory (filmed in Agoura, California by Benji Bakshi, who got his 
    start filming Billy Blanks Tae Bo videos [!], but you wouldn't know 
    it here, as the cinematography is lush and beautiful, with memorable 
    vistas you rarely see in films today). On the third day of their 
    travels, their horses are stolen by Mexican banditos, but Brooder's 
    beautiful horse Saucie won't let anyone but Brooder ride her, so the 
    Mexicans cut her throat (the horse is not quite dead, so Brooder has 
    to shoot what is his best friend in the head to end Saucie's misery. 
    This is a very heart-rendering scene that will put a tear in your 
    eye). Sheriff Hunt is determined to save the hostages before they are 
    eaten, so everyone makes the journey on foot, even Arthur with his 
    broken leg. Since this is the mid-1800's, Arthur stands the chance of 
    losing his leg to gangrene, but his love for Samantha proves to be 
    more important than his leg so he pushes on, telling the other three 
    to leave four rocks to mark their trail and he will catch up with 
    them when they bed down for<A HREF="bone_tomahawk_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/bone tomahawk dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    the night. What happens next will leave your jaw on the ground, as 
    Sheriff Hunt and Chicory are captured by the Troglodytes (Brooder is 
    killed in what turns out to be an act of self-sacrifice). Can Arthur 
    save his wife and from these cannibals or will this whole trip have 
    been for naught? I'm not going to tell you, because this is a film 
    best experienced without knowledge of what is to come. Directed and 
    written by S. Craig Zahler (<B><A HREF="#BrawlCell99-2017">BRAWL IN 
    CELL BLOCK 99</A></B> - 2017; <B><A HREF="dragged_across_concrete_2018.htm">DRAGGED
     ACROSS CONCRETE</A></B> - 2018), in what is his freshman debut as a 
    director, but you wouldn't know it because it looks like it was 
    directed by someone in the same league as Howard Hawks or John Ford, 
    only with ladles of bloody gore and unbearable violence. Zahler has 
    established himself with his first three directorial efforts as a 
    person to keep an eye on and I couldn't be happier to say that this 
    film is not only a visual treat, his screenplay is full of memorable 
    dialogue, mainly by Richard Jenkins as Chicory, who says the 
    strangest things at times when it is the least expected (his flea 
    circus story is one for the books). Some of the gore you will see is 
    Arthur killing a Troglodyte and cutting out a device from it's neck 
    (it's how they whistle/howl to each other) and using it by blowing 
    into it to kill other Troglodytes (it's quite ingenious). The 
    show-stopper is when Sheriff Hunt, Chicory and Samantha watch as the 
    head Troglodyte scalps Deputy Nick (exposing his brain) and then 
    tears him in half from crotch-to-neck (absolutely nothing is left to 
    the imagination). There's also a beheading and a really nasty top of 
    a foot being chopped off with a tomahawk made from a human coccyx 
    bone (hence the film's title). The film runs 132 minutes, but there 
    is not a wasted scene here, making it the quickest two hours and 
    twelve minutes I have ever experienced. Do yourself a favor and watch 
    this film as soon as possible. It is also filled with cameos from the 
    likes of Kathryn Morris (TV's <B><A HREF="cold_case_tv_series_2003-2010.htm">COLD
     CASE</A></B> - 2003-2010), James Tolkan (<B><A HREF="ministry_of_vengeance_1989.htm">MINISTRY
     OF VENGEANCE</A></B> - 1989), Sean Young (<B><A HREF="blade_runner_1982.htm">BLADE

     OF 1000 CORPSES</A></B> - 2002) and a blink-and-you'll-miss-it 
    appearance by Michael Pare (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Seed2007">SEED</A></B> 
    - 2007). My favorite film of 2015!;<A NAME="Insane2015"></A>&nbsp; 
    While I generally dislike the feature films of 
    director/producer/cinematographer/editor/writer (or co-writer) Eros 
    D'Antona, such as <B><A HREF="#Haunted2016">HAUNTED</A></B> (2016) 
    and <B><A HREF="#DieIn1Day2017">DIE IN ONE DAY</A></B> (2017), as 
    they are bland, uninteresting and copies of more successful films, I 
    must make an exception with his first feature film, <B><A HREF="insane_2015.htm">INSANE</A></B> 
    (2015), if only for its strange characters and, yes, insane set 
    pieces. Rather than a horror film this is a crime drama with revenge 
    themes. When a crime kingpin (Davide Gambarini) is murdered by Frank 
    (Alex Lucchesi), the wife of the kingpin, Vivien (Linda Hand), hires 
    the kingpin's nephew, mercenary/hitman Condom (Roberto D'Antona; 
    director/star of <B><A HREF="#RoadToHell2018">ROAD TO HELL</A></B> 
    (2018), a film I admire and he's Eros D'Antona's younger brother), to 
    find and kill Frank, who has gone into hiding with his brother 
    Christian (Steven Renso) and his young nephew Alex (Zac Zanghellini), 
    who idolizes Frank. Condom is no ordinary hitman; he's a 
    sado-masochist who loves to get the shit beaten out of him, but don't 
    dare turn your back on him when you think you have won, or he'll kill 
    your ass (One man tells Condom that he is crazy and he says, 
    &quot;Yes, my mother was a whore. She was the first to jerk me 
    off!&quot;). Condom may also be gay (the way he walks, dresses in 
    loose-fitting primary color zoot suits and uses his hands is quite 
    unique and impressive), but there is no doubt that his partner, Adam 
    (Ivan King), is as gay as Richards Simmons, but, unlike Simmons, he's 
    an expert martial arts fighter that can floor you with one punch (he 
    also carries an umbrella, which he uses as a weapon). Condom and Adam 
    meet in Italy to look for Frank, killing everyone that tell them they 
    don't know Frank. One such <A HREF="insane_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/insane 2015 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>unlucky
     person works in a junkyard, so Condom and Adam tie him to the blades 
    of a forklift while Condom pulls the hairs out of one of his nipples 
    with tweezers, sticks pins through the nipple and then cuts the 
    nipple off with a knife! He finishes off the man by cutting off his 
    penis and shooting him in the head (Condom laughs the entire time), 
    attaching a piece of paper to his forehead with a piece of pre-chewed 
    gum that only reads &quot;Frank&quot;. We then learn why Frank killed 
    the crime kingpin. The kingpin sent Frank a DVD video that shows him 
    killing the love of Frank's life by slitting her throat while she is 
    tied to a chair. The kingpin taunts Frank constantly on the video and 
    Christian asks him why he watches this DVD all the time. Frank 
    replies, &quot;I watch it when I want to get angry.&quot; And you 
    don't want to get Frank angry! He's an expert fighter, as we see when 
    he saves a woman from getting raped by three punks. Frank floors them 
    all and tells the woman to walk away. He also confronts a 
    &quot;Firespitter&quot; (Simone Fox) and challenges him to a fair 
    fight. The Firespitter, starts spitting fire at Frank, setting one of 
    the gloves on his hand on fire, so Frank grabs his knife and throws 
    it into the middle of the Firespitter's head. Meanwhile, Condom hires 
    a prostitute to get him off. Instead of having sex with her, he makes 
    her wear a golden mask and calls her &quot;mummy&quot; while she 
    jerks him off (I guess he was right about his whore mother!). When he 
    hires another prostitute from the same call-in service the next day 
    and the same prostitute shows up, he kills her by shoving a knife 
    into the back of her head until the blade exits out her mouth, but 
    not before she gets him off! Things come to a head when Frank and 
    Adam get into a knock-down, drag-out martial arts fight (it's quite 
    good), while Condom gets into a fight with Christian and Alex. Frank 
    defeats Adam, killing him, only Christian and Alex are not so lucky 
    (Remember what I said about turning your back on Condom?). When Frank 
    comes home, he finds Christian and Alex dead, lying in pools of 
    blood. He vows to kill Condom, but the film doesn't afford us that 
    chance. In my only real complaint about this film, it ends on a note 
    where nothing is resolved. Two police detectives, Mike (Mirko 
    D'Antona) and Joe (Gianluca Busco), shoot Frank in the shoulder just 
    as Frank and Condom are about to battle each other and the film ends 
    with both of them being handcuffed and Condom smiling at Frank. Maybe 
    Eros D'Antona was hoping to make a sequel, which hasn't happened yet 
    (review written in early 2020). I hope it eventually gets made, just 
    to see who wins the fight. Roberto D'Antona is over-the-top as 
    Condom, but it works here, as his character is supposed to be that 
    way. Alex Lucchesi is wonderful as Frank. We can actually feel his 
    hurt when he finds his brother and nephew dead and his fight scenes 
    are done without the help of a stuntman, proving he is very athletic. 
    This blood-drenched film may not be for everyone (You will know if it 
    is or isn't in the first five minutes), but I found a lot to admire 
    here. I just wish Eros D'Antona's other films were on this level. 
    Look for D'Antona Family regulars Michael Segal as a pimp, Crisula 
    Stafida as Katia, Annamaria Lorusso as Mary and David White as 
    Vivien's bodyguard, who gets his eye stabbed-out by Condom. Available 
    streaming on Amazon Prime (at the time this review was posted).;<A NAME="Deathgasm2015"></A>&nbsp;
     People have been telling me that I must see <B><A HREF="deathgasm_2015.htm">DEATHGASM</A></B> 
    (2015) for quite some time now and when I found it streaming for free 
    on Amazon Prime, I decided to give it a view. It's vile, 
    foul-mouthed, salicious, immoral, obscene, filthy, lecherous, coarse 
    and nearly every other synonym I could find in my thesaurus. In other 
    words, I loved it! This unclassifiable New Zealand flick reminds me 
    of the early gore films of director Peter Jackson, in its execution, 
    gore and, especially, humor. Heavy metalhead Brodie (an excellent 
    Milo Cawthorne; &quot;I brought about the demonic apocalypse. Biggest 
    dick-move ever.&quot;) is forced to move in with his uber-religious 
    uncle when his unbalanced mother is institutionalized (for blowing a 
    Santa Claus in the middle of a store with kids watching!). He is 
    picked on in school and out of school by his douchebag of a cousin, 
    David (Nick Hoskins-Smith; &quot;He's hospitalized more nerds than 
    asthma.&quot;), who beats him up constantly,<A HREF="deathgasm_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/deathgasm amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
    especially when he becomes interested in his girlfriend, Medina 
    (Kimberley Crossman; &quot;The #1 cause of boners in her high 
    school.&quot;). The only friends he is able to make in this boring 
    town are nerd Dungeons &amp; Dragon players Dion (Sam Berkley; 
    &quot;Probably the least embarrassing orifice dice has been shoved in 
    to.&quot; [his nose]) and Giles (Daniel Cresswell; &quot;He was once 
    suspended for violating the CPR training dummy.&quot;). The only 
    place that Brodie feels comfortable in is the alternative music 
    record store in town, where he meets Zakk (James Blake; &quot;A 
    tornado of chaos leaving a trail of destruction and teen pregnancies 
    in his wake.&quot;). They become fast friends and they, along with 
    Dion and Giles, form their own heavy metal band, which they name 
    &quot;Deathgasm&quot;. Zakk only thinks about himself and never 
    thinks about the repercussions of his actions, especially when he and 
    Brodie break into the home of heavy metal singer Rikki Daggers 
    (Stephen Ure) and steal a record album out of his sleeping hands. 
    Brodie and Zakk escape the house just before hitman Vadin (Tim 
    Foley), who works for evil bad guy Aeon (Andrew Laing), enters the 
    house and slits Rikki's throat (the blood flows like a river!) when 
    he won't tell him where &quot;it&quot; is. That &quot;it&quot;&nbsp; 
    is the Black Hymn, music so evil, it brings the demon apocalypse when 
    played correctly. And guess where it is? That's right, in the record 
    album that Zakk and Brodie stole! (When Aeon learns that Vadin failed 
    to get the Black Hymn, two of his henchmen cut off Vadin's head. When 
    Aeon complains that they got blood on his expensive oriental rug, he 
    makes them throw down some plastic on the rug and tells them to cut 
    off his head again, this time properly! What happens next will make 
    you howl with laughter). Brodie is able to read the Black Hymn's 
    music, so he and the band play it, causing nearly everyone in town to 
    turn into demons who throw-up a tremendous amount of blood on their 
    victims (This film goes to comic lengths to display how much blood 
    they throw up, especially what a demonic teacher does to one of his 
    female students). With no one to help them, the band has to come up 
    with a way to reverse the curse. Maybe if they play the song 
    backwards? I don't want to spoil this film for you, but there are 
    many funny and very gory scenes to be had here (Death by large black 
    double-sided dildo? Check. Penis dismemberment? Check again. Chainsaw 
    disembowelment? Right on!), especially how Medina handles an axe, 
    giving demons a splitting headache! This is a film where no one is 
    safe and nothing turns out the way you think it will, surprising the 
    viewer at every turn. First time feature film director Jason Lei 
    Howden (his next film was <B><A HREF="#GunsAkimbo2019">GUNS AKIMBO</A></B> 
    - 2019), a visual effects artist by trade, shows a deft hand with the 
    material, giving you a film that is so visual and so funny, it will 
    probably be one of your favorite films both during and after you 
    watch it. This film isn't for everyone (especially if you don't like 
    gory violence), but for those who appreciate this type of film, there 
    is so much to enjoy here and you will be overloaded with so many 
    memorable images and pieces of dialogue, you'll watch it twice in a 
    row (which is what I did). Gore films are not dead, they just come 
    from New Zealand now! Stay tuned after the final credits for a funny 
    stinger. A sequel is currently in production, its release predicted 
    sometime in late-2020/early-2021. <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">SIDE NOTE:</FONT></B>

     Nearly everyone who reads this site knows I can't stand most 
    &quot;Found Footage&quot; films, mainly because they go against all 
    common sense and defy reality (i.e. Would you still carry a camera 
    when your life is in immediate danger and film your own death?), but 
    I am willing to make an exception when the film is done properly and 
    has a lot of actual scares. That film would be <B><A HREF="hell_house_llc_2015.htm">HELL
     HOUSE LLC.</A></B> (2015), a found footage film with a great story, 
    scares aplenty and a mystery that gets you immersed in the story 
    right from the very beginning. The film opens with police cars, 
    ambulances and fire trucks arriving at a haunted house attraction in 
    a small town in Upstate New York called Abaddon (I don't know about 
    you, but that name screams &quot;Lovecraft&quot; to me!). The 
    attraction, at the old abandoned Abaddon Hotel, renamed &quot;Hell 
    House&quot;, is the site of 15 deaths, including four of the five 
    staff who created it and eleven tour goers, yet the police and <A HREF="hell_house_llc_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/hell house llc poster6a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>authorities
     covered-up the reason why they were killed. Five years later, a 
    documentary crew try to find out the reason why and how all these 
    people were killed, interviewing the only crew member who survived, 
    Sara Havel (Ryan Jennifer Jones). Sara brings with her a bag of video 
    tapes, telling the female interviewer, Miranda Kelly (Miranda 
    Robbins), that she took the tapes before the police could get their 
    hands on them and this will be the first time anyone will view them, 
    as Sara herself dared not look at them for all these years. We then 
    take a look at these tapes, where we see crew head honcho Alex Taylor 
    (Danny Bellini) and crewmembers Sara, her boyfriend Paul O'Keefe 
    (Gore Abrams), Tony Prescott (Jared Hacker) and Joey (Phil Hess) 
    enter the long-abandoned Abaddon Hotel for the first time. This place 
    has a bad history, as the owner of the hotel hanged himself in the 
    1970's for reasons unknown and anyone who tried to re-open the hotel 
    met similar fates. Sitting unused for the past fifteen years, the 
    hotel is in a state of disarray, perfect for a Halloween haunted 
    house. Paul, who was elected to film everything that is going on (so 
    the crew can view it at a later date to see what they did right and 
    what they did wrong for the next year's haunted house) begins to film 
    the crew putting together the exibits for the haunted house; they 
    have less than two months to get the hotel ready for business. After 
    setting up cameras in every room, including the spooky basement, 
    which has a giant pentagram painted on one of its walls (not put 
    there by the crew), strange things begin happening to Paul, all of 
    which he documents on camera. First, he sees what he thinks is Sara 
    sleepwalking one night, but it's not unusual for Sara to do that, so 
    he ignores it. Every night after that, Paul hears noises that wake 
    him up from a sound sleeps, so he turns on the camera and goes to 
    investigate. I'm not going to explain any further other than to tell 
    you it is very creepy (Including the actions of a clown mannequin 
    they put in the basement, which turns up all around the house, Alex 
    thinking one of the crew is playing a practical joke on him until the 
    clown's head moves, looking directlay at him. The clown's mannequin 
    head has no joints, so it cannot move!). On the first day of the 
    official opening, something awful happens, which is all on film, 
    including footage taken by a tour-goer. It results in the death of 
    fifteen people. The film is not quite over yet, as Sara has a 
    surprise in store for the documentary crew back at the site of the 
    Abaddon Hotel, which has been boarded up since the massacre five 
    years ago. This is a thoroughly creepy experience which raised 
    goosebumps on my body on several occasions. Director/screenwriter 
    Stephen Cognetti pulls great performances from his actors, making 
    their characters totally believable and vunerable to the point you 
    actually care what happens to them. Not only that, but the footage 
    Paul shoots demands 100% of your attention because there is always 
    something going on in the background which you will totally miss if 
    you don't pay attention. It is those things that will raise your 
    shackles and the finale is especially harrowing. While lacking any 
    blood, gore or nudity, this film doesn't need it because it's the 
    terror factor that stands out here, wondering from the beginning what 
    actuaslly happened to the crew and tour-goers. Unlike most found 
    footage films, which show you nothing, especially at the end of the 
    film, this film doesn't stoop to that low level, it delivers what it 
    promises: A scary and, above all, a soul-frightening experience. 
    Director Stephen Cognetti has made <A HREF="hell_house_llc_2015.htm#TrilogyPosters">two
     sequels</A> (so far), all of them getting good reviews as the 
    original, so look here for reviews of them in the future. If you are 
    an Amazon Prime member, you can see this streaming for free. Another 
    great reason for becoming a Prime member. I won't go as far as to say 
    I like found footage films, but I will say that this one did impress me.;<A NAME="HouseOnPineSt.2015"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Most modern-day haunted house films, especially those made in the 
    New Millennium, follow the same tired pattern, mainly plenty of jump 
    scares with no real frights to be had. And then there's <B><A HREF="house_on_pine_street_2015.htm">THE
     HOUSE ON PINE STREET</A></B> (2015), a haunted house film done 
    right. There's no graphic violence or nudity to be had here, yet the 
    scares are palpable, relying on mood and good acting to deliver the 
    frights. We see a married couple, seven months pregnant Jennifer (an 
    excellent Emily Goss) and Luke (an equally good Taylor Bottles) move 
    from Chicago to a rented house in a small town in Kansas, which 
    happens to be Jennifer's childhood town. We know something bad 
    happened to Jennifer in Chicago, but the film peels back layers of 
    Jennifer's past to get to it. It's obvious Jennifer is suffering from 
    some personal issues, which is why Luke moved them out of Chicago to 
    this small town where Jennifer's overbearing mother, Meredith (Cathy 
    Barnett, whom you just want to punch in the mouth), still lives. 
    Meredith insists on running Jennifer's life, which Luke is okay with, 
    for reasons still unclear. Meredith throws Jennifer and Luke a 
    partyin their new rented home, something<A HREF="house_on_pine_street_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/house on pine street poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    Jennifer is very unhappy with because she doesn't know most of the 
    people her mother invited to the party. At the party, Jennifer meets 
    the mysterious Walter (Jim Korinke), a man who seems to be interested 
    in the house's rooms upstairs (he just stares up the stairs with a 
    worried look on his face). Walter seems to know all about Jennifer's 
    life, including the recent &quot;incident&quot; in her past. Jennifer 
    soon learns from another partygoer that Walter is psychic and a 
    medium, something which Walter flatly denies. So how does he know 
    about her past and why is he looking intently upstairs? Strange 
    things begin happening to Jennifer in the house, like boxes moving on 
    their own and constant knocks on the front door, but when Jennifer 
    opens it, no one is there. Is it possible a ghost is haunting this 
    house or is it all in Jennifer's troubled mind? Even Jennifer doesn't 
    want to tell her husband what is happening, afraid he will think she 
    is losing her grasp on reality again, but when she is tossed down the 
    flight of stairs by an unseen force, Luke begins to believe that 
    Jennifer is having another &quot;episode'.&nbsp; It seems that back 
    in Chicago, Jennifer tried to give herself an abortion to get rid of 
    the baby because she hated being pregnant. Luke believes that the 
    tumble she took down the stairs was another attempt to get rid of the 
    baby, not believing that she was attacked by a mysterious 
    supernatural &quot;force&quot; (Would you believe it given her past 
    attempt to abort her baby?). Merideth and Luke double-down on keeping 
    a close watch on Jennifer, which just fills her with hate for both of 
    them (as well as her unborn baby), because neither of them will 
    accept that the house is haunted. We also begin to realise that it 
    all may be in Jennifer's fragile mind, but when an upstair closet 
    door explodes from its hinges, we do begin to believe her, but can 
    she get anyone else to? She goes to Walter for some help, but he 
    refuses to help her, saying he doesn't believe in ghosts, but he does 
    believe that inanimate objects, such as a house, can have a will of 
    its own. He looks Jennifer in the face and tells her she since is 
    filled with so much hate, is it no wonder that the house is hating 
    her back? Serious and deadly trouble happens when Jennifer delivers 
    her baby boy, whom they name Tyler (a name both Jennifer and Luke 
    picked when they found out she was pregnant with a boy). I'm not 
    going to tell you what happens next, but there are no happy endings 
    here. This is a haunted house film like no other, thanks to directing 
    brothers Aaron &amp; Austin Keeling, who also co-wrote the screenplay 
    with Natalie Jones. This is an adult take on the haunted house genre 
    that will not only leave you feeling sad by how it ends, but also 
    satisfied that you have watched something that doesn't cater to the 
    lowest common denominator. People that we hate, such as Meredith and 
    Walter (who's not afraid to say exactly how he feels), turn out to 
    actually be caring people, because we were seeing everything through 
    Jennifer's hateful eyes and not seeing the real truth. I recommend 
    this film wholeheartedly, as it was just what I needed to bring my 
    faith back to modern supernatural films. Available streaming on 
    Amazon Prime, Tubi and even YouTube, this is one film you should 
    definitely watch to get the stink of modern supernatural films out of 
    your nostrils.;<A NAME="Ghostline2015"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another 
    haunted house film worth your time is <B><A HREF="ghostline_2015.htm">GHOST</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="ghostline_2015.htm">LIN</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B><A HREF="ghostline_2015.htm">E</A></B> 
    (2015). It's just different enough to make you take notice, 
    especially the way all the main characters treat each other. They 
    treat each other as human beings, not punching bags or 
    mean-spiritedly; when they disagree, they don't resort to 
    name-calling or foul language. In other words, these people are more 
    realistic than in most other horror films. <A HREF="ghostline_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("159","212") --><IMG SRC="images/ghostline amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>In
     what is basically an extended version of <B><A HREF="twilight_zone_original_tv_series.htm">THE
     TWILIGHT ZONE</A></B> episode &quot;Night Call&quot; (1964; it even 
    gets name-dropped in the film), the film opens eight years ago, where 
    we watch someone bury a body wrapped tightly in a sheet in a shallow 
    grave and then drive away. We then see the dead body's spirit (or 
    soul, for those who believe in such things) ascending towards the 
    heavens, only to get cockblocked by a telephone line. In the present, 
    we watch as two in-love actors from Los Angeles, Chelsea Watkins 
    (Rachel Alig) &amp; Tyler Jantzen (Zack Gold), who have been living 
    together for over four years, move into the house of Tyler's 
    recently-deceased Aunt in a small town in California. It couldn't 
    have come at a better time, because acting jobs for the duo have come 
    few and far between and they are nearly broke. The only bad thing 
    about the Aunt's house is that cellphone service is very spotty, so 
    Chelsea and Tyler invest in a landline (an actor without a working 
    phone is a death knell for their career). It just may be the worse 
    decision they have ever made. And the deadliest. As soon as the 
    landline is installed, Tyler begins getting phone calls from a woman 
    named Ellen, who tells Tyler that she knows he is a man named Eric 
    and no matter how much Tyler tells her that isn't so, there's no one 
    in this house named Eric, she refuses to believe him. Every time 
    Tyler hangs up the phone, Ellen calls back and says the same thing, 
    Calling Tyler &quot;Eric&quot; and saying that she will soon be 
    seeing him to make him pay for what he did to her. The phone calls 
    come so frequently at all hours of the night, that Tyler is forced to 
    unplug the phone so he can get some sleep. The next morning, Chelsea 
    plugs the phone back in and discovers that Ellen has left over fifty 
    messages, not saying anything, just breathing heavily into the 
    receiver. After a few days of this, Tyler calls the phone company to 
    find out where the calls are coming from, only to learn from the 
    technician on the other end that the calls are coming from a 
    &quot;ghostline&quot; and it is impossible to trace. She recommends 
    Tyler changing the phone number to stop the bothersome calls. I guess 
    we can see where this is heading. Even with the phone number changed, 
    Ellen still calls Tyler at all hours of the night and says she 
    doesn't believe he isn't Eric. Things begin to get weird when Chelsea 
    and Tyler go out to dine at a restaurant and return home, only to 
    find the place ransacked. The police are called in and Detective Nick 
    Turner (Burt Culver; <B><A HREF="mermaid_down_2019.htm">MERMAID DOWN</A></B> 
    - 2019) and his partner Detective Darla Starr (Rachel Elizabeth Ames) 
    are put in charge of the case. Now it must be said that these two 
    detectives are the most understanding officers I think I have ever 
    seen in any horror film. They treat Chelsea and Tyler like human 
    beings and even puts them in touch with a ghost hunting couple when 
    the supernatural is mentioned as a possible cause.&nbsp; Detective 
    Nick even traces the phone number back to anyone who previously had 
    it and learns it was once owned by an elderly couple, whose nephew, 
    Eric Chambers (Justin Little; <B><A HREF="hellbenders_2012.htm">HELLBENDERS</A></B> 
    - 2012) was once a suspect in the disappearance of his girlfriend, 
    Ellen Pendleton (Andrea Bensussen), but since her body was never 
    found and no evidence against him, Eric was able to escape being 
    charged with a crime. Ever since Ellen's disappearance, seven more 
    women have mysteriously disappeared and Eric is a suspect, but 
    nothing can be done to him without evidence. The ghost hunting couple 
    then do an investigation of Tyler's house and when they see the 
    decomposing body of Ellen approaching them, they beat a hasty retreat 
    from the house, telling Tyler and Chelsea to put all the equipment 
    they left behind in their driveway, because they are never stepping 
    foot in that house again. A self-professed &quot;ghost exorcist&quot; 
    (he's a fraud only in it for the money) is then called in to rid the 
    house of Ellen, only to have the ghostly Ellen twist his head around 
    180&#176;, killing him. When Detective Nick spends the night in the 
    house wit<A HREF="ghostline_2015.htm"><IMG SRC="images/ghostline poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>h
     Tyler and Chelsea, he is possessed by Ellen's spirit, walks into the 
    unmarried couple's bedroom and points his pistol at Tyler's head, but 
    a quick-thinking Tyler wrestles the gun out of Nick's hand just 
    before he pulls the trigger. Since they are too broke to move 
    anywhere else, Tyler and Chelsea come up with an idea of how to rid 
    their house of Ellen. Chelsea comes on to Eric at his favorite bar 
    and invites him to come home with her, hoping Ellen will see him and 
    stop thinking Tyler is him. The plan works flawlessly, but Eric isn't 
    as stupid as he looks, tying up Chelsea and Tyler and telling them 
    that, yes, he is a serial killer and they will be his ninth and tenth 
    victims. Tyler gets Eric to tell him where he buried all the other 
    bodies, including Ellen's and he tells them. That's when the ghost of 
    a decaying Ellen appears and she rips Eric's heart out from his 
    chest, then turning into her beautiful self and finally ascending to 
    the heavens in a bright flash of light.&nbsp; Detectives Nick and 
    Darla then tell Tyler and Chelsea that they have discovered five 
    bodies, one of them being Ellen's, and they believe they will find 
    the rest shortly. Thinking that their troubles are over, the phone 
    rings and Chelsea picks it up. It's Eric on the other end and he 
    tells Chelsea that he will be seeing her very soon. THE END. Acted 
    with a sense flair by the cast, director/screenwriter/co-producer 
    Dean Whitney (his only feature film as director at the time this 
    review was written) has crafted a film that doesn't rely on gore and 
    extreme violence to make the film frightening (although there are two 
    eye-opening deaths on view), relying on atmosphere and the acting 
    talents of the cast to convey the fear. And it works. If you ever 
    wondered what it would be like to have your house haunted by a deadly 
    spirit, this is the perfect film to watch. There's a lot to recommend 
    in this film, things I never even touched on, so if you want to see a 
    haunted house film done right on a low budget, this is one you should 
    be seeking out.</FONT></FONT></P>

     God knows <B><A HREF="chair_2015.htm">THE CHAIR</A></B> (2015) is 
    not a film for anyone with a weak nervous system, as it is 
    relentlessly grim and dark in tone. It is also Roddy Piper's last 
    film role (He died during post-production), so I had to watch it 
    since I am a rabid Piper fan (and always will be). It is also based 
    on a graphic novel written by this film's Executive Producer, Peter 
    Simeti. This horror film takes place in Death Row at some unnamed 
    prison, where prisoner Richard Sullivan (Timothy Muskatell, who looks 
    like Charles Manson) has been sitting in a dank cell for fifteen 
    years waiting for the Governor to call to commute his death sentence, 
    as he professes his innocence to anyone who will listen. Sullivan is 
    accused of raping and killing over thirty children, but he swears 
    that he is not the type of man to do such a thing. Sullivan is also 
    haunted by memories of his white trash mother (Naomi Grossman) 
    abusing him as a boy; whipping the soles of his bare feet with a 
    leather belt, while he yells for his older brother Tommy to help him. 
    Mom blames Richard for driving <A HREF="chair_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/chair 2015 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="214" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>their
     father away, leaving her jobless with two young mouths to feed. 
    Every time Mom gets drunk (which is often), she takes it out on young 
    Richard, while Tommy (whom she doesn't abuse) hides in a closet 
    cowering. Richard is also accused of killing his mother, which he 
    also denies. Making life terribly difficult and painful for Richard 
    on Death Row are a quartet of guards, led by the extremely cruel 
    Murphy (Roddy Piper; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#ProWrestZombies2013">PRO
     WRESTLERS VS. ZOMBIES</A></B> - 2013), who pisses and spits into 
    Richard's meals, that is when Murphy feels like feeding him and the 
    other prisoners. Prisoner Sammy (John Siciliano) hasn't eaten in four 
    days, so during open cell time to stretch their legs, Richard lets 
    Sammy eat the food he has hidden away, which doesn't sit too well 
    with Murphy. He has the automatic cell door close in Sammy's cell, 
    while a terribly weak Sammy lies halfway out of his cell, the cell 
    door cutting Sammy in half! Also making all the prisoners lives seem 
    worthless is Warden Enrik (Bill Oberst Jr.; <B><A HREF="#ThreeFromHell2019">3
     FROM HELL</A></B> - 2019), who dons doctor scrubs, a white lab coat 
    and goggles and operates on the prisoners in various painful and 
    bloody ways.&nbsp; When it is Richard's turn, the Warden tells him he 
    will search for his &quot;Achille's heel&quot;, saying every person 
    has a weak spot and he will find his. But how does the Warden know 
    that Richard's Achille's heel are the soles of his feet? The Warden 
    then starts playing &quot;This Little Piggy&quot; with Richard's 
    toes, breaking some of them with pliers (a scene very hard to watch). 
    The film does seem like nothing but torture porn, but there's an 
    underlying theme that child abuse causes violence. One such torture 
    porn sequence comes when the four guards sexually abuse a prisoner 
    until he dies. Guard Riley (Zach Galligan; <B><A HREF="waxwork_1988.htm">WAXWORK</A></B> 
    [1988], if you can believe it) makes the prisoner give him a blowjob, 
    while guards Alvarez (Noah Hathaway; <B><A HREF="troll_1986.htm">TROLL</A></B> 
    [1986], if you can believe it) and Simmons (Derrick Damions) take 
    turns fucking him in the ass. Murphy finishes the prisoner off by 
    shoving his nightstick so far up the prisoner's ass, he kills him 
    (wiping off the nightstick with his tie when he is finished). Things 
    come to a boil when the Governor calls and refuses to commute 
    Richard's sentence; he is to die in the electric chair (the 
    &quot;Chair&quot; of the title) in 36 hours (This is after Johnny The 
    Janitor [Robert Rhine], starts mopping up the blood and gore of 
    Sammy's death. Richard grabs the mop handle and shoves it down 
    Johnny's throat, killing him.). So is Richard actually a killer or 
    does his treatment in prison cause him to become a killer? That 
    question is answered in the film's finale, where it is revealed that 
    the Warden is actually Richard's older brother Tommy (!) and 
    flashbacks show us that Richard is, indeed a killer, as we watch him 
    kill his mother with a butcher knife by stabbing her in the back and 
    raping and killing a boy while driving an ice cream truck. And, yes, 
    he did rape and murder 30 children; he just denied it so much that he 
    began to believe his own lies (Denial is not only a river in&nbsp; 
    Egypt!). The film ends on a rather dark note, as Richard gets even 
    with all the guards and his brother, but he doesn't escape, he takes 
    his own life (shooting himself in the mouth) after strapping Tommy to 
    the Chair and pulling the switch. This film is so dark, that it will 
    change your normally cheery tone to something quite the opposite. 
    Director Chad Ferrin, who also gave us the good low-budget horror 
    flicks <B><A HREF="unspeakable_2000.htm">UNSPEAKABLE</A></B> (2000) 
    and <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Ghouls 2003">THE GHOULS</A></B> 
    (2002), both also featuring Timothy Muskatell, has fashioned a film 
    with absolutely no light moments. Everything is fashioned to give you 
    a no-holds-barred look at life in prison, where there is no time for 
    jokes or comedy. This is a film made expressly to make you feel awful 
    and the prisoner rape sequence will make you run to the bathroom to 
    either puke or take a shower. Either way you will feel dirty. This 
    isn't a film to watch with a group, it is one to watch alone. It is 
    well made, yet not very bloody (even Sammy's death is not shown in 
    detail, yet the sound effects accompanying his death will startle 
    you). Like I said in the beginning, this film isn't for everyone, but 
    if you like films that are so bleak, it will make you glad you are 
    alive, no matter how awful your life is, then this is the film for 
    you. I actually admire it for not backing down from its original 
    premise. Life in prison, especially on Death Row, isn't a picnic in 
    the park and this film has no problem showing you that. Great job and 
    highly recommended for those who are willing to take a chance. The 
    film ends with a short tribute to Roddy Piper. I still miss him.

    (2019)! He carries this film as a man who is about to have the worst 
    few days of his life and he deals with it violently and wrongly, like 
    a person with nothing to lose. Buddy<A HREF="buddy_hutchins_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/buddy hutchins poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    Hutchins (Kennedy) is broke. His dry cleaning business is failing, 
    his wife Stephanie (Remington Moses) is cheating on him for the last 
    two years with his best friend Don (David Gere), his son Joel 
    (producer Richard Switzer) hates him with a passion unlike any son 
    for his father (even going as far as to lie about Buddy in court), 
    his ex-wife Evelyn (Sara Malakul Lane) is using her new black 
    boyfriend Ryan (Demetrius Stear) to harass Buddy for back alimony and 
    his father (Harwood Gordon) disappeared ten years ago after murdering 
    his brother, Buddy's uncle. Since his elderly mother Bertha (an 
    excellent Sally Kirkland, who is almost unrecognizeable), whom he 
    loves, is as broke as he is, Buddy hits up his rich gay brother Troy 
    (Steve Hanks) for twelve thousand dollars, which he gladly gives to 
    him, but warns him &quot;don't go back the way you use to be&quot; 
    (Troy doesn't visit his mother often because she doesn't agree with 
    the gay lifestyle, but in this film, she tries to live with it for 
    his sake). Buddy is a recovering alcoholic who hasn't touched a drop 
    in over a year. He was in constant legal trouble when he was drinking 
    and Troy had to bail him out of jail many times in the past, either 
    for driving drunk, getting into accidents or just being a bad, 
    violent drunk. Buddy was also a guitarist in a fairly well-known punk 
    band, but he quit when he got married, dried up and started a family 
    (not necessarily in that order). What is about to happen to him is 
    almost unbelievable and will drive Buddy back to the bottle, making 
    him do things in bloody retribution, his soused brain believing it is 
    the only way to settle things. The only good thing in his life is his 
    pre-teen daughter Molly (Milana Lev), whom he loves with all his 
    heart and she feels the same way about him, no questions asked, but 
    even that will not be enough to stop him from doing what he believes 
    has to be done. The bad things start happening when Stephanie hires a 
    lawyer to get a divorce, forbidding him to enter in his own house or 
    see his daughter without written permission (he is forced to live 
    with his mother). Things get much worse when Bertha dies in the 
    hospital from heart disease (Troy refuses to pay for a better 
    facility, telling Buddy that she's old and things like this happen), 
    but not before telling Buddy where he can find where his father is 
    hiding. When Buddy goes there, he accidently shoots his father in the 
    stomach with his own shotgun when trying to wrestle it away from him, 
    but before he dies, he tells Buddy that his mother was a whore and 
    that he's not actually his father, his uncle is. His brother got her 
    pregnant, which explains to Buddy why Troy looks nothing like him. 
    Things get even worse when Ryan comes to collect Evelyn's alimony 
    money. When Buddy tells him&nbsp; he has no money, Ryan begins 
    smashing everything Buddy owns, including his TV set and some 
    valuable glass items. When Ryan tries to destroy Buddy's electric 
    guitar, Buddy beats him to it, smashing it over and over on Ryan's 
    head, turning his skull into a crushed bloody mess. He then knocks 
    out Evelyn, ties her up and carries Ryan's body outside, dumping it 
    in his garden. He is then stopped by a cop friend of his, wondering 
    why Buddy is gardening in a business suit (he is on his way to 
    Molly's grade school play) and when he hears Evelyn yelling for help, 
    Buddy grabs his gun and shoots him in the head, also dumping his body 
    in the garden. Buddy then grabs a chainsaw and cuts Evelyn into 
    little pieces as she begs for her life. He then makes the long drive 
    to Troy's house, where he uses the chainsaw to cut off his 
    boyfriend's right arm and them decapitates him with it (nothing is 
    left to the imagination). He then blames Troy for their mother's 
    death and uses the chainsaw to cleave Troy's <A HREF="buddy_hutchins_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/buddy hutchins poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="137" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>head
     in two! When he goes to Molly's school to see her in the play, 
    Stephanie refuses to let him come inside, saying he has no right to 
    see her. Later, he goes to Don's house (it's implied that Don may be 
    sexually abusing Molly) and shoots him with a pistol, kidnaps a 
    willing Molly, which leads to a police chase back to his former home 
    (the police have discovered Troy and his boyfriend's bodies and it is 
    all on home security cameras, where they can clearly see Buddy 
    chainsawing them). A gunfight ensues, but Buddy leaves a secret 
    message on his phone for Molly, which he puts in her backpack, and 
    tells her to leave the house, but not to let the police search her 
    backpack. The house then explodes and the police believe Buddy is 
    dead. He isn't, of course, and while the ending may be a little too 
    pat for my liking, it does ends on a satisfying note. 
    Director/screenwriter Jared Cohn may not be what we would call a good 
    filmmaker (as witnessed by the previously mentioned <B><A HREF="devils_revenge_2019.htm">DEVIL'S
     REVENGE</A></B>), but hiring Jamie Kennedy to portray Buddy was a 
    brilliant choice, as he kills it (both literally and figuratively) 
    here. He's simply fantastic as Buddy, a man hit with so many bad 
    things at once he has no other choice but to deal with things the way 
    he sees fit (I know I would turn to alcohol if the same thing 
    happened to me, but unlike Buddy, I am a happy drunk). This film gets 
    extremely bloody at times, especially when the chainsaw is involved. 
    Nothing is held back for your imagination, as people are sliced apart 
    and lose appendages (could a head be considered an appendage?) and 
    even the various gunshots don't skimp on the sauce, as people are 
    shot in the head, stomach and other places. There's also bloody 
    baseball bat violence, guitar violence; hell, anything that can be 
    used as a weapon is put into play here. I went into this film not 
    expecting much, but was more than pleasantly surprised with the 
    outcome. Look for a cameo from WWE wrestler Dolph Ziggler as a 
    witness at Buddy's trial that runs during the closing credits. If you 
    want to watch something different (I wouldn't necessarily call this a 
    horror film, but it certainly has horror elements), I recommend you 
    give this film a try. You just may like it as much as I did.;<A NAME="FuryOfTheDemon2015"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Here's a really good one: In January of 2012, an American film 
    collector going by the name of Edgar Allan Wallace came to France 
    with a &quot;lost&quot; silent film short from 1897 and invited all 
    film scholars, critics and celebrities in the area to watch it, not 
    telling anyone the actual title of the film. The packed theater began 
    to watch the film, <I>&quot;La Rage Du Demon&quot;</I>, and almost 
    instantly everyone became violent, attacking each other with a 
    ferocity they never knew they were capable of. Six<A HREF="fury_of_the_demon_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/fury of the demon amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="214" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    people died when the theater caught fire and victims of the film's 
    showing tell the interviewer that they felt rage come over them when 
    watching the film and there was nothing they could do about it. All 
    they remember about the ancient film short is that the Devil 
    materialized in the flesh. The reel of film itself just up and once 
    again disappeared. So begins the sixty-minute pseudo-documentary <B><A HREF="fury_of_the_demon_2015.htm">FURY
     OF THE DEMON</A></B> (2015), a film so endearing in its 
    presentation, you may believe that the cursed film is real. Helping 
    the documentary are real French personalities, such as directors 
    Alexandre Aja (<B><A HREF="haute_tension_2003.htm">HIGH TENSION</A></B> 
    - 2003; <B><A HREF="hills_have_eyes_2006.htm">THE HILLS HAVE EYES</A></B> 
    - 2006) and Christophe Gans (<B><A HREF="brotherhood_of_the_wolf_2001.htm">BROTHERHOOD
     OF THE WOLF</A></B> - 2001; <B><A HREF="silent_hill_2006.htm">SILENT HILL</A></B> 
    - 2006), among many other real people, who tell the story so 
    earnestly that you may think this is fact, not fiction. The icing on 
    the cake, though, since the cursed film can be traced back to the 
    &#147;Father of Special Effects&#148;, Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s, 
    is the appearance of Pauline M&eacute;li&egrave;s, Georges 
    M&eacute;li&egrave;s' grandaughter, who tells us everything she knows 
    about her grandfather's association with the cursed film. The 
    off-screen narrator (who speaks French with English subtitles; the 
    entire film is English subtitled) explains the the cursed film has 
    only been shown once during each century and every time it was shown 
    was during a time of world upheaval, resulting in violence and death 
    to those who watched it. The first time it was shown was in Paris in 
    1897 (France was going through a bad period then, known as the 
    &quot;Dreyfus Affair&quot;), the second time was in New York City's 
    Virginia Theater in 1939 (the beginning of World War II) and the last 
    time in 2012 at Paris' Mus&eacute;e Grevin (another bad time for 
    France, known as &quot;The Race Riots&quot;). The narrator and some 
    talking heads tell us that the fictional Edgar Allan Wallace (a 
    combination of writers Poe and Wallace's names) found the lost film 
    in Russia in film canisters marked with swastikas (implying that the 
    Nazis wanted to use the film against their enemies in WWII). The 
    factual part of this fake documentary gives us a history of Georges 
    M&eacute;li&egrave;s film career, giving us snippets of his short 
    films (some of them colorized by hand by M&eacute;li&egrave;s) and 
    explaining to us that M&eacute;li&egrave;s made over 500 short films, 
    but only two-hundred survived, the rest lost to history (He was known 
    for shooting two negatives of his films; one for delivery to America 
    and one for France; he considered the United States an important 
    market and even opened an office in New York). Since editing film was 
    before M&eacute;li&egrave;s' time, he had to perform his visual 
    tricks in-camera and he did them with such a flair that some of his 
    techniques are still used today (I could watch all 
    M&eacute;li&egrave;s' films in one sitting, as they are fascinating 
    and full of fantasy and horror). M&eacute;li&egrave;s was also a 
    professional magician, using many of his tricks in his films. He was 
    also a non-believer in the occult, believing that people should be 
    exposed to the truth, not fantasy as reality, which is why many of 
    his short films deal with ghosts, skeletons and all cliches of the 
    supernatural, usually in a comical manner. The fictional part of this 
    film is that M&eacute;li&egrave;s had a protog&eacute; named Victor 
    Sicarius, who was a true believer in the occult, taking 
    M&eacute;li&egrave;s to mediums and seances to try and make him a 
    believer. M&eacute;li&egrave;s even let Sicarius use his camera 
    equipment in the late 19th Century to make his own short films, and 
    this cursed film may be a film made by Sicarius, not 
    M&eacute;li&egrave;s, but <A HREF="fury_of_the_demon_2015.htm#VictorSicarius">none
     of Sicarius' films survived</A> and it can't be proven as everyone 
    who has seen this cursed film short can't remember anything about it 
    other than Satan appearing in it. The fictional part continues with 
    Sicarius dating a female admirer of M&eacute;li&egrave;s, a pretty 
    woman named Juliette Andre, who appeared in some of 
    M&eacute;li&egrave;s' lost short <A HREF="fury_of_the_demon_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/fury of the demon france poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>films.
     The friendship ended between Sicarius and M&eacute;li&egrave;s and 
    he was not permitted to step foot in M&eacute;li&egrave;s' studio or 
    use any of his camera equipment. When Juliette disappeared and years 
    later her mutilated and murdered body was discovered, blame fell on 
    Sicarius, but since there was no evidence that he actually killed 
    her, he was never brought to justice. No one knows what happened to 
    Sicarius, but we do know that M&eacute;li&egrave;s was forced to stop 
    making films in 1914 because he never made a single dime off of any 
    of his films (due to thieves making copies of his films and using a 
    razor to scratch out the identifying bug that Melies would put on the 
    bottom right of his films, claiming them as their own. True story, 
    according to Pauline M&eacute;li&egrave;s.). Georges 
    M&eacute;li&egrave;s died in poverty in 1938, making a living by 
    being the proprietor of his own candy store and never using a camera 
    again (Even though he was awarded the French Legion Of Honor in 1931 
    for his contributions to cinema). While this documentary is short, it 
    passes by quickly due to the insertion of many actual 
    M&eacute;li&egrave;s film clips. Any film scholar will tell you that 
    M&eacute;li&egrave;s was decades ahead of his time, using his magic 
    techniques and in-camera trickery to make films that are still 
    effective (and sometimes frightful) today. He was truly a master of 
    his craft. Director/screenwriter Fabien Delage (the below-average 
    French found footage flick <B><A HREF="#ColdGround2017">COLD GROUND</A></B> 
    - 2017) doesn't show us one frame of footage of this lost cursed 
    film, rather relying on <A HREF="fury_of_the_demon_2015.htm#FakeNewspaperArticl">realistic
     fake newspaper articles</A> and witness testimony to advance the 
    film. This is really a loving tribute to the career of Georges 
    M&eacute;li&egrave;s and how we all are worse off for not seeing over 
    three-hundred of his films that remain lost. Hope does remain that 
    some of these lost films will be found in attics, warehouses, 
    abandoned theaters and other places before falling victim to mold, as 
    people don't know what treasures they really have. We can dream, 
    can't we? This is an excellent little film that you should watch to 
    get an idea how these lost films are a part of our history, but back 
    then film was considered a disposable media and that trend lasted to 
    the mid-1960s. It took a rather long time to learn from our mistakes, 
    didn't it?;<A NAME="Nine11OfficerDn2015"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp; Readers of 
    this site know my distaste for found footage flicks, but if they are 
    done right I will be the first to recommend them. Such is the case 
    for <B><A HREF="911_officer_down_2015.htm">911: OFFICER DOWN</A></B> 
    (2015), a twisted take on one of the original found footage TV 
    series, <B><A HREF="cops_tv_series_1989.htm">COPS</A></B> (1989 - 
    2020; which has recently been revived after being shut down during 
    the George Floyd debacle in 2020, where every cop was considered our 
    enemy. Yes, it was as ridiculous as it sounds.). This film takes 
    place in Los Angeles, California (exterior shots filmed there, but 
    the majority of the film was lensed in Vancouver, British Columbia, 
    Canada) where a two man crew of the TV series &quot;L.A. Beat&quot; 
    (the original title of the film), cameraman Franco (Javier Badillo) 
    and boom mike soundman Roger (Philip<A HREF="911_officer_down_2015.htm"><IMG SRC="images/911 officer down dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    McAlary), are going to film a police officer on his rounds for the 
    night. After stopping for a donut and coffee break in the car, 
    someone taps on the car window and when the officer opens the door, 
    he is tased by Blue (Mikal Grant), a cop wannabe dressed in full 
    police regalia. He throws the police officer in the trunk of the car, 
    takes the two man film crew hostage and makes them record&nbsp; his 
    actions as a fake police officer for the night. He pulls over an 
    asthmatic driver for driving too slow (25 in a 30mph zone!) and 
    tortures the man by making him blow way too long in the breathalyzer 
    (which he hasn't even turned on!) until his asthma acts up and he's 
    unable to breathe. Blue then locks the man in the trunk of his own 
    car and they drive off to the next fake bust, which turns out to be a 
    twentysomething white man spray painting graffiti in a tunnel. Blue 
    physically and emotionally taunts the young man for spray painting a 
    gang insignia in the tunnel (using the &quot;N&quot; word constantly 
    like a raving racist) and then handcuffs him and puts him in the car. 
    Instead of arresting the young man (which he couldn't do even if he 
    wanted to), Blue makes a deal with him: if he delivers a note to a 
    group of black men down the street (in the wrong part of town), he 
    will let him go free. As long as he doesn't read the note, he will be 
    a free man. The young man then cautiously walks over to the group of 
    black men and hands one the note. Suddenly, the group beats the snot 
    out of the young man until he lies unconscious on the ground. Both 
    Franco and Roger plead with Blue to stop this before the young man is 
    killed, so he turns on the sirens and the group of black men run 
    away. Blue then takes the note and shows&nbsp; Roger and Franco what 
    it says: &quot;I love to suck black dick&quot;. Things get really 
    serious when Blue takes a radio call of a man dealing drugs on a 
    street corner. He sees the drug dealer and a gunfight ensues, Blue 
    shooting the drug dealer in the ass. He handcuffs the drug dealer and 
    makes him sniff the large bag of cocaine he is holding over and over 
    until he overdoses and dies. Blue then picks up a hooker named 
    Sparkle (Devon Bree Baker) and butt-fucks her in the back seat of the 
    police car (Sparkle complains that he is fucking her in the wrong 
    hole, but he throws another hundred dollar bill at her and she stops 
    complaining!), while Franco and Roger film the whole thing. He then 
    offers Sparkle a lot of money to lead him to her pimp, Blue saying 
    that all he is trying to do is his part to clean up this dirty town 
    (He knows one man can't do much to clean up this town, but at least 
    he is doing something to make it safer for the innocent. Yeah, 
    right). He then brings the pimp to his hotel room and shoves his 16 
    inch collapsable police wand all the way up the pimp's ass until he 
    passes out (He makes Roger smell the wand after he pulls it out of 
    the pimp's ass!). Blue then tells Roger and Franco that he has 
    something really important to do, driving to a large garage, pulling 
    his captive police officer out of the trunk and tying his arms to the 
    cruiser's front bumper. He then drives forwards and backwards, the 
    tires rising as if they hit something. Blue then gets out of the car 
    and shows them the police officer's arms, which have been separated 
    from the rest of his body! After Franco blows chunks when seeing the 
    bloody dismembered arms, Blue takes them out to a shop that serves 
    the best hotdogs in the city, Blue telling them that hot dogs are a 
    cop's favorite food. As they are in the shop, a robber enters with an 
    automatic rifles and demands the money from the cash register, not 
    caring in the slightest that there's a cop inside because he's stoned 
    out of his mind. The film ends here, as a shootout ensues in which 
    Roger and the shop clerk are shot and killed and Blue empties his 
    pistol into the robber, as the police gather outside. Blue takes 
    Franco hostage, points his gun at his head and walks outside and it 
    all ends rather badly with both Blue and Franco getting shot and 
    killed. I hated this rather quick ending, but damn if I could think 
    of a better way for this highly involving film to end. The three 
    leads are very good in their roles, even though they all never acted 
    in another film before. I originally thought Philip McAlary as Roger 
    was overacting a bit, as his head would move back and forth when he 
    talked and his eyes looked unusual, like he was stoned. Then I 
    learned he was actually blind (!) in real life and it made sense (his 
    blindness is never talked about in the film). The real star of this 
    film is Mikel Grant as Blue, who makes his role believable when <A HREF="911_officer_down_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("139","212") --><IMG SRC="images/911 officer down aka l.a. beat poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="139" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>it
     could have come across as cartoonish. Little by little, we learn 
    about his life, such as he once was a cop who got kicked off the 
    force for killing the person responsible for his wife and child's 
    death, We also learn he is really named Blue because his 
    great-grandfather and grandfather were cops and his father was a 
    butcher, but he wanted to be a cop, so he named his son Blue, because 
    &quot;cops bleed blue&quot;. But let's not mistaken Blue for a good 
    guy because he isn't. He gets off on torturing people for offenses we 
    wouldn't think were against the law (at least not as much as Blue 
    does), such as driving too slow or creating graffiti. He also likes 
    his drugs, as he steals the drug dealer's cocaine, snorts it and also 
    forces Franco and Roger to take hits of it. They also beg Blue not to 
    kill them and he tells them it all depends how good they are at their 
    jobs at the end of shift. Blue is a psycho, no doubt about it, but 
    he's a damn likable psycho if you can skip past all the bad things he 
    does. Director/producer/screenwriter Christoph Kositza turns in a 
    pretty good film that you won't think of as a found footage film 
    because it is shot as professionally as the TV series it was based 
    on. No herky-jerky camerawork, just basically fluid camera shots by 
    someone well versed in how to use a digital video camera. All found 
    footage flicks should be this entertaining. <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">BITCHING

     after a 14 year absence, I wanted to see what he churned out. And I 
    wasn't disappointed. When former Black Ops agent Stanley Hill (a fit 
    Travolta, who is excellent if you can ignore his bad hairpiece) 
    watches his wife Vivian (Rebecca De Mornay) being murdered, he tries 
    legal means to find out why. It is apparent to Stanley that Detective 
    Gibson (Sam Trammell of <B><A HREF="true_blood_cable_series.htm">TRUE BLOOD</A></B>)
     and his group of other detectives are corrupt and may be in on his 
    wife's murder (Stanley beats up two detectives and forces them to 
    give back all the money to an old oriental woman they shook down 
    every month as &quot;protection&quot; for her restaurant. The next 
    day, Stanley watches as the two injured detectives in casts and 
    bandages carry a huge envelope of money into the restaurant and one 
    of the detectives says, &quot;I don't know what hurts worse, the beat-down
     or doing this.&quot;). Stanley and his best friend Dennis 
    (Christopher Meloni of <B><A HREF="law_and_order_special_victims_unit_tv_series.htm">LAW
     &amp; ORDER: SVU</A></B> and very good, as well as funny), another 
    former Black Ops agent, work together to get to the bottom of 
    Stanley's wife's murder. From this moment on, the film is nothing but 
    a series of well-staged shootouts, explosions and fisticuffs, where 
    no blood is spared. This was the quickest 92 minutes I have sat 
    through in a long time, as some of the set-pieces are nail-bitingly 
    suspenseful and this film goes way past what we would regard as an 
    R-Rating, as people are shot in the head, lose body parts and are 
    blown apart in explosions. It also has a satisfying conclusion, which 
    leaves the film open for more Travolta/Meloni films in the future 
    (and I hope there are, as they make a great team). I am glad Chuck 
    Russell is back and this is better than most action films I have seen 
    in theaters, but it seems to me that a lot of John Travolta films are 
    going straight to DTV simply because he is being punished for being a 
    Scientologist. It can't be because of the value of the film. He makes 
    a perfect action hero here and also has in some of the other films of 
    his that have gone the DTV route. I only hope this is Chuck Russell's 
    return to the directorial chair and we don't have to wait another 14 
    years for another film. This one has everything an action film fan 
    could ask for and more. Highly recommended.; <B><A HREF="other_side_of_the_door_2016.htm">THE
     OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR</A></B> (2016) is one of those horror films 
    you are either going to love or hate, there will be no middle ground. 
    I happen to love it because of its exotic location (Mumbai, India) 
    and some really terrifying scares. A husband and wife, Michael 
    (Jeremy Sisto; <B><A HREF="law_order_tv_series.htm">LAW &amp; ORDER</A></B> 
    - 2007-2010) and Maria (Sarah Wayne Callies; <B><A HREF="into_the_storm_2014.htm">INTO
     THE STORM</A></B> - 2014) are vacationing in India when Maria 
    announces she is pregnant. They decide to live in India because 
    Michael's job was looking to create an office there. Six years pass 
    and Maria is a wreck. It seems Maria and Michael had two children, 
    Oliver (Logan Creran) and Lucy (Sofia Rosinsky), and Oliver drowned 
    when the car Maria was driving went over a bridge into a raging river 
    during a monsoon. Oliver was trapped, so Maria was only able to save 
    Lucy. Maria is on a spiral of depression, until one day she decides 
    to overdose on sleeping pills, but Michael is able to save her by 
    getting her to the hospital on time. Michael and Maria's housekeeper, 
    Piki (Suchitra Pillai), asks Maria if she would like to talk to her 
    son for one last time and say the things she couldn't say to him 
    before he died. It involves a Hindu ritual where they dig up Oliver's 
    grave and perform a supernatural spell, where they burn Oliver's body 
    and then Maria goes into a temple and is only able to talk to Oliver 
    through the door. But by no means must she open the door or bad 
    things will happen. Maria agrees to do all this, but makes Piki swear 
    never to tell Michael. They perform the ritual and Maria talks to 
    Oliver through the door, but when Oliver says he must go, Maria 
    thinks she didn't have enough time with him, so she opens the door. 
    Big mistake. Something besides Oliver comes to our side and begins to 
    make life hell for Maria and Lucy. Michael is still oblivious to it 
    all because he spends so much time at the office. At first, Maria 
    believes that the ghost of Oliver has followed her home, because the 
    piano starts playing Oliver's favorite tune. But things turn nasty 
    mighty quick. Lucy starts ending up with bruises on her body. The 
    fish in their pond all die and so do the plants. Chairs slide across 
    the floor and pin Maria into one, where she is forced to sit and read 
    Oliver's favorite story. Scary looking Hindu people begin to appear 
    wherever Maria goes and scare the shit out of her and Lucy. And then 
    we find out the spirit is of a violent girl named Myrtu (played by 
    male actor Javier Botet, and this is not the first time he has 
    portrayed a female ghost or demon. He played a female in <B><A HREF="rec_2007.htm">[REC]</A></B> 
    - 2007 and <B><A HREF="mama_2012.htm">MAMA</A></B> - 2012), the 
    Gatekeeper of the Underworld. I'll leave the rest for you to 
    discover. What surprised me most is that this film was directed and 
    written by Johannes Roberts, who gave us one of the worst 
    money-making horror films of all time <B><A HREF="storage_24_2012.htm">STORAGE
     24</A></B> (2012; look for a review in the bad DTV section), so I 
    was surprised I would like this film so much. It may remind people of 
    all those American-made versions of Japanese horror films (which I 
    mostly hate), but this one has very unusual location work and some 
    truly scary scenes (it starts nearly in the beginning with a small 
    girl on the beach who points at Maria, screams and her face begins to 
    change into something horrible). See if you agree with me and watch 
    it when you get the chance.; I have to say that I wasn't expecting 
    much from director/producer/co-writer Stephen Chow's <B><A HREF="mermaid_2016.htm">MERMAID</A></B> 
    (2016), since I found most of his previous films overlong visual 
    effects festivals with a minimal of story. Boy was I surprised here. 
    The film starts off in a slapstick comical way (which almost made me 
    turn it off), but there was something about it that told me to stay 
    with the film. The basic plot of the film is about a self-absorbed 
    land developer named Liu Xuan (Chao Deng) and his partner, Li Ruolan 
    (Yuqi Zhang), who plans on developing a gulf with a shipwreck on it 
    into an vacation hotspot.<A HREF="mermaid_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mermaid 2016 china poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="245" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    Unfortunately, the area is also the home for the last of a horde of 
    mermaids and other creatures, including their leader, The Octopus 
    (Zhixiang Luo) and an elderly mermaid Queen, with the biggest 
    flippers you ever saw. The Octopus assigns female mermaid Shan (the 
    beautiful Jelly Lin, a.k.a. Yun Lin) to disguise herself as a human 
    hooker (the way it is done is quite ingenius) and kill Liu Xuan. She 
    tries using many undersea weapons, but is comically defeated every 
    time and never noticed by Liu Xuan. An American scientist (Ivan 
    Kotik, who speaks perfect Mandarin), has developed a sonic weapon 
    that will kill all dolphins from returning to the gulf (they try the 
    weapon out in a goldfish bowl and the poor goldfish explodes), but 
    that also means it will kill all the mermaids and other creatures in 
    the gulf. Unfortunately, Shan falls in love with Liu and things 
    become very complicated until it develops into Liu being betrayed by 
    Li Ruolan, who wants a live mermaid to become extremely rich and that 
    mermaid happens to be Shan. You'll have to watch the film to see how 
    it turns out. One thing I loved about this film is how it starts out 
    as a slapstick comedy and within its short 94 minutes (for Stephen 
    Chow films, anyway) slowly becomes more violent and violent until 
    there is an all-out war between the mermaids and Li Ruolan's 
    automatic weapon-carrying soldiers. It turns out to be a bloodbath 
    until Liu Xuan and The Queen intervenes and the tacked-on finale 
    gives it a happy ending, the only thing that seemed to be unoriginal, 
    but kind of touching anyway. Besides some dodgy CGI, the film is a 
    spectacle for the eyes, as the colorful underwater scenery seems to pop-out
     of the screen (it was shot in 3D). This is the most finacially 
    successful Chinese film ever made, bringing in nearly $500 million in 
    China in 2016 alone (it will also soon be adapted into a TV Series). 
    There is a reason for that. It is very entertaining, full of action 
    and some good comedy (watching two police officers trying to draw a 
    mermaid from Liu Xuan's description is a howl) and a really good 
    all-out bloody brawl during the finale (as well as an ecological 
    message like in the 2009 documentary <B><A HREF="cove_2009.htm">THE COVE</A></B>).
     Even though it was certified hit in China, it only got a limited 
    theatrical/VOD release in the United States before being dumped on 
    disc and cable TV. At least we get to see it as it was originally 
    intended, language in Mandarin with English subtitles. Look for 
    Chinese legend Tsui Hark as Uncle Rich (he uses the pseudonym &quot;Ke
     Xu&quot; here). Hark said he only took the part because he wanted to 
    see how Stephen Chow works, since all his films have been certified 
    hits in China. This is also the only Stephen Chow directed film 
    without Stephen Chow as the star. My highest recommendation; If <B><A HREF="kickboxer_vengeance_2016.htm">KICKBOXER:
     VENGEANCE</A></B> (2016) seems familiar, it is because the plot 
    follows nearly all the martial arts films since they were created in 
    the U.S and abroad in the 1980's. This one features a very good 
    performance by Jean-Claude Van Damme, who starred in the original <B><A HREF="kickboxer_1989.htm">KICKBOXER</A></B> 
    (1989), only this time he is the teacher rather than the fighter 
    (although he does a good amount of martial arts fighting on his own 
    without the benefit of a stuntman; more than I remember him seeing do 
    in the past several years, where he preferred guns over martial 
    arts). Like I said, the story is as old as the ages: When Kurt Sloane 
    (Alain Moussi; a stuntman-turned-actor and not bad at all) sees his 
    brother Eric (the late Darren Shahlavi, in his final film role) 
    killed at the hands of Muay Thai champion Tong Po (<B><A HREF="guardians_of_the_galaxy_2014.htm">GUARDIANS
     OF THE GALAXY</A></B>'s and WWE wrestler David Bautista) in an 
    underground martial arts combat ring (a caged squared circle) in 
    Thailand, the Muay Thai inexperienced (but martial arts <A HREF="kickboxer_vengeance_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/kickboxer vengeance 2016 poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="207" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="2"></A>proficient)
     Kurt promises that he will kill Tong Po for what he has done. Three 
    months pass and he has to prove himself to Eric's teacher Master 
    Durand (Van Damme, sporting a wicker fedora and sunglasses, even in 
    the rain!) that he is worthy enough to be taught Muay Thai. 
    Eventually, Master Durand gives in and agrees to train Kurt, while 
    Kurt's soon-to-be girlfriend Marcia (Gina Carano), a local Thailand 
    Royal Police detective (half of whom are on Tong Po's take), tries to 
    stop Kurt from getting himself killed (He saves her life once from a 
    bunch of Tong Po's thugs, part of the fight taking place on the backs 
    of two elephants!). The second third of the film is one big 80's 
    montage, as Durant gets Kurt into shape for his first fight (he has 
    to work his way up to Tong Po) and Van Damme seems to be having a 
    good time here (he's thinner than normal, but still built like a 
    brick shithouse and can still kick high). After some successful and 
    unsuccessful fights, Kurt decides he is ready for Tong Po, but Durant 
    proves to him that he isn't (Durant beats Kurt in a 
    well-choreographed martial arts fight, but then pro-Po fighter Kavi 
    {UFC fighter Georges &quot;Rush&quot; St-Pierre; <B><A HREF="death_warrior_2009.htm">DEATH
     WARRIOR</A></B> - 2009} comes to join in, which Durant makes 
    mincemeat of and convinces Kavi to be Kurt's sparring partner!). We 
    all know how all these films end, so there is no reason to tell you 
    what it is, but this film definitely belongs to Jean-Claude Van 
    Damme. I originally thought he was just going to put in a 5 minute 
    cameo, but the fact is, he looks like he is having so much fun making 
    this film, you can't help but like it, too. Van Damme may be getting 
    old, but with his age comes not just plenty of exercise to keep him 
    in shape, but a true ability to act. It also doesn't hurt that 
    everyone, including Gina Carano, know how to fight in real life and 
    director/actor John Stockwell (<B><A HREF="cat_run_2011.htm">CAT RUN</A></B> 
    - 2011; and made <B><A HREF="in_the_blood_2013.htm">IN THE BLOOD</A></B> 
    - 2013 with Gina Carano) fills this movie with little tributes to the 
    first film (and ignores the &quot;sequels&quot; starring Sasha 
    Mitchell and Mark Decascos). One such little tribute is when a 
    prisoner asks Durant and Kurt to take him with them when they escape 
    prison. The prisoner who asks that question is Michel Qissi, who 
    played Tong Po in the original film. The end of the film also 
    contains a funny scene for those who remember the original movie. 
    Dimitri Logotheti, the director of <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Slaughterhouse Rock">SLAUGHTERHOUSE
     ROCK</A></B> (1987), is co-writer of this film and is directing and 
    writing a sequel to this film starring both Van Damme and Moussi and 
    called <B><A HREF="kickboxer_retaliation_2017.htm">KICKBOXER: RETALIATION</A></B>,
     for release sometime in 2017. David Bautista is the person who puts 
    minimum time into this film, as we watch him kill Eric in the 
    beginning of the film (and then bed two naked ladies), see him kill 
    another opponent at the film's halfway mark and then gets into the 
    main fight at the end (but it is a lengthy fight, nearly 20 minutes 
    long). Instead of being bald or having short-cropped hair like we 
    normally see him, he sports an enormously thick ponytail and chin 
    hair which makes him look even more evil. If you just want to watch a 
    good old-fashioned mindless martial arts action flick like you did in 
    the 80's &amp; early-90's, I can't think of a better film to 
    recommend. Van Damme deserves to be on the big screen again. I love 
    his DTV films, but someone should give him a chance to be in 
    theatrical films again. His acting abilities will surprise you.; <B><A HREF="morgan_2016.htm">MORGAN</A></B> 
    (2016) is one of those modern-day technical sci-fi films with a 
    heart, even if the subject of the title (and someone else) may not 
    have a human one. Morgan (Anya Taylor-Joy; <B><A HREF="witch_2015.htm">THE
     WITCH</A></B> - 2015) is a woman in her young 20's who was created 
    solely without any human DNA (we see photos of the abominations that 
    were first born and killed before Morgan became a viable human-like 
    baby), created by a team of scientists consisting of such people as 
    Dr. Lui Cheng (Michelle Yeoh, still as beautiful as ever) whom Morgan 
    calls &quot;Mother&quot;, Dr. Simon Ziegler (Toby Jones; <B><A HREF="rite_2010.htm">THE
     RITE</A></B> - 2010), Dr. Kathy Grieff (Jenniffer Jason Leigh; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#AmityvilleAwake2015">AMITYVILLE:

     KNICK</A></B> - 2014-2015). When Morgan was two weeks old, she had 
    the body of a two year-old girl and five years later, she has the 
    looks and the body of a young woman in her twenties. One day, 
    apparently for no<A HREF="morgan_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/morgan 2016 poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    reason, Morgan rips the left eye out of Kathy, so corporate bigshot 
    Jim Bryce (Brian Cox in an extended cameo) sends his best problem 
    solver, Lee Weathers (Kate Mara; <B><A HREF="transsiberian_2008.htm">TRANSSIBERIAN</A></B> 
    - 2008), to decide whether Morgan should live or die. Since the 
    incident with Kathy, which Morgan doesn't have any explanation for, 
    she is kept in a large room with one side of the room encased in 
    bulletproof and unbreakable glass. Lee is somewhat a souless person, 
    who shows very little emotion (this was a small problem for me, since 
    I guessed the ending based solely on Kate Mara's performance, even 
    though she is a looker.) and when Skip Vronsky (Boyd Holbrook; <B><A HREF="walk_among_the_tombstones_2014.htm">A
     WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES</A></B> - 2014 and <B><A HREF="run_all_night_2015.htm">RUN
     ALL NIGHT</A></B> - 2015, both starring Liam Neeson), a worker at 
    the institute, kisses her, she looks at it as a new experience. Then 
    the shit starts hitting the fan. A psychiatrist, Dr. Alan Shapiro 
    (Paul Giamatti in a cameo), sits across a table asking Morgan some 
    questions, when she gets up and takes a huge bite out of Shapiro's 
    neck, killing him (a quite effective scene). Morgan locks Lee in the 
    glass encased room and starts killing everyone in various bloody 
    ways, except for her best friend Amy and Skip, who manages to avoid 
    Morgan. Morgan saves &quot;Mother&quot; for last as she is sending a 
    video to corporate headquarters that Morgan is an experiment who 
    failed. But is Morgan a failure? Lee manages to escape the glass room 
    (another giveaway) and she chases Morgan and Amy in a car chase, but 
    Morgan makes Lee's car slam into a tree. Skip comes driving by and 
    Lee takes control of his vehicle, with Skip as a passenger. Morgan 
    stops at the end of a dirt road and leads Amy to a dock by a lake. 
    Lee tries to kill Morgan, but Lee ends up impaled through the stomach 
    on a tree branch. Morgan joins Amy on the dock and looks at her 
    reflection in the water. Tears start coming out of Morgan's non-human 
    eyes, proving that even non-human genetically-created lifeforms can 
    have feelings. But the camera pans behind Morgan to find Lee standing 
    there with a gun. She shoots and kills Morgan, her body falling into 
    the water. Lee the puts a bullet right between Amy's eyes. When she 
    comes walking back to Skip's vehicle, she non-chalantly shoots and 
    kills Skip. A clean-up team is sent to the secluded laboratory and 
    the woods to get rid of all the bodies when Jim Bryce exposes that 
    Lee is also a non-human genetic creation made at another lab and she 
    is the best in the business. They have created the perfect assassin. 
    One with no feelings. This is Luke Scott's first film as a Director 
    of a feature film (he was Second Unit Director on some recent big 
    films for Ridley Scott, who is one of the Producers here) and he 
    keeps things moving at a lightning pace (especially the last 35 
    minutes) and the violence is quite shocking because it comes out of 
    nowhere. I guessed Kate Mara as Lee was also a laboratory creation 
    from nearly the first scene she was in. Her icy demeanor, Darren's 
    kiss and the way she escapes the glass room only further enhances the 
    theory that she is not human. Besides that major mis-step, this is a 
    cracking good action/sci-fi film that was made on a budget of $8 
    million, just a small pittance when compared to the films of Ridley 
    Scott, and you can see Scott's hand in some of the scenes (Morgan 
    always wears a hoody and in some scenes the hood seems to pulsate). 
    This had a small release to theaters in September 2016 in the U.S., 
    where it hardly made half of its budget back, but that is no reason 
    why you should not check this better than average flick. I enjoyed it 
    immensely, flaws and all.; Now give me a few minutes here before

     RACE 2000</A></B> (1975), but because, even though it takes place in

    a famous driver named Jed Perfectus (Burt Grinstead), who is gay but 
    refuses to believe it (He won't make love to his beautiful navigator

     vehicle named A.B.E. (voiced by D.C. Douglas), who finally passes 
    the point of being an A.I. and becomes human; and, of course, 
    Frankenstein (Manu Bennett; but I am sure David Carradine would have 
    reprised his role if he were still alive), who is sick and tired of 
    killing people and just wants to live a normal life. His navigator 
    happens to be Annie Sullivan (Marci Miller), who works for the 
    Rebels, headed by Alexis Hamilton (Yancy Butler), who wants this 
    waste of human lives to stop. The game is run by world leader The 
    Chairman (Malcolm McDowell, with the weirdest hairpiece he has ever 
    worn), who believes keeping the world's people jobless and replaced 
    by machines is the way for all corporations to become rich (a nuclear 
    experiment has made everyone sterile, so there have been no births 
    for years), but he is growing tired of Frankenstein's refusal to kill 
    innocent human beings (he even swerves his car so that he doesn't hit 
    a kitten swatting at a butterfly!) and plans to make sure that no one 
    crosses the three day cross-country race's finish line in New Los 
    Angeles, so he works with Hamilton and the Rebels to make sure that 
    happens. The people sitting at home are watching the race through 
    their VR headsets (much like today's youth with their video games) 
    and can put themselves in the eyes of anyone in the race. 
    Director/co-writer G.J. Echternkamp (this is his first sci-fi/horror 
    film) also brings up a lot of things that are wrong with today's 
    society, but it isn't a political film. There are gory kills, a 
    humorous homosexually-themed fight between Jed and Frankenstein and 
    plenty of racing action (the cars are not bad-looking). Frankenstein 
    knows that Annie works for the Rebels (at one time, Annie puts a 
    steel-trap devise up her vagina to sever Frankenstein's penis, but he 
    refuses her advances because she was in the shower so long and wasted 
    enough water for a month!), but Annie starts to come around to 
    Frankenstein's point of view and at the finale, Frankenstein does 
    something to make the populace of New Los Angeles to revolt against 
    each other and he and Annie fall in love as the city burns to the 
    ground. There's a lot of valid social commentary in this film 
    disguised as a gory horror film (and the gore flows freely and 
    frequently, as bodies are cut in half, blown apart, heads and body 
    parts hit the cars and other human carnage, all done very well), but 
    that is what B-Films like this should do: Make you think a little bit 
    while you enjoy the blood. I highly recommend the film, but get the 
    disc version, as the version shown on SyFy cuts out some of the 
    gorier parts, bleeps out all the &quot;fucks&quot; (but, 
    surprisingly, keeps everything else in) and blows up frames to crop 
    out the nudity. This is Producer Roger Corman's best film in years, 
    yet it made it's debut on Home Video. Don't pass this by because you 
    think it is cheap. It is probably Corman's best-looking film in a 
    long time thanks to a co-production between Universal Pictures (who 
    also handle the disc release in the U.S.) and New Horizon Pictures.; <B><A HREF="term_life_2016.htm">TERM
     LIFE</A></B> (2016 ) is a very interesting crime actioner if you can 
    get over Vince Vaughn's bad hairpiece (he looks like Moe Howard of 
    the Three Stooges!). It was also the second feature film directed by 
    Peter Billingsley, the child actor from <B><A HREF="christmas_story_1983.htm">A
     CHRISTMAS STORY</A></B> (1983). Instead of shooting his eye out with 
    a Red Ryder carbine action, two-hundred shot range model air rifle, 
    Billingsley has people shot in the groin, head,<A HREF="term_life_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/term life 2016 poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    stomach and chest. Vaughn is Nick Barrow, an unassuming crook who 
    plans robberies and heists down to the last detail and sells them to 
    the highest bidder. When one of his planned robberies goes wrong and 
    the brother of crime kingpin Viktor (an excellent Jordi Molla) is 
    killed, he puts a hit on Nick. A troubled Nick takes out an insurance 
    policy on his life and must remain alive for 21 days until his 
    estranged daughter Cate (Hailee Steinfeld; <B><A HREF="enders_game_2013.htm">ENDER'S
     GAME</A></B> - 2013) can collect the money. He hasn't talked to his 
    daughter in over 12 years, but he has kept a close eye on her 
    activities (His ex-wife is in rehab for drug addiction). Nick must 
    stay away from various hitmen, especially crooked police detective 
    Joe Keenan (the late Bill Paxton, in one of his final film roles), 
    who is the one who actually killed Viktor's brother, and his equally 
    crooked (and nervous) partner, Detective Matty Miller (Shea Whigham; <B><A HREF="boardwalk_empire_tv_series.htm">BOARDWALK
     EMPIRE</A></B> - 2010-2014), who stole the money from the botched 
    heist. Nick tries to reconnect with Cate, but it proves to be quite 
    difficult, because she never understood why he left her life. When he 
    explains to her what he does for a living, she starts to soften and 
    pulls his ass out of the fire several times, especially when Viktor 
    and his right-hand man Marko (Cain Velasquez) kidnap him and Viktor 
    tells Nick that he is going to die. Nick does not know how to talk to 
    his daughter, so he asks his best friend and partner Harper (Jonathan 
    Banks, who has some terrific one-liners) what to say to his daughter 
    (Harper says, &quot;Talk about Barbies&quot;!). Nick has very many 
    close calls, but he always manages to escape, until Cate comes up 
    with the perfect plan to clear her father (seems like she inherited 
    some of Nick's crime genes). This film is fast, funny, bloody and 
    violent. Paxton shoots people just for looking at him funny and 
    begins to kill his partners, beginning with Matty. (Mike Epps is also 
    one of his corrupt partners). This is a very satisfying crime/action 
    fan, as there are many shootouts where nothing is left to the 
    imagination. Look for both Terrence Howard (as a scared local cop who 
    gets into a disasterous shoot-out) and Taraji P. Henson in their 
    first film together. They would become huge on FOX's <B><A HREF="empire_tv_series_2015.htm">EMPIRE</A></B> 
    (2015 - 2020) as a rich music mogul and his scheming wife. Vaughn's 
    friend Jon Favreau and Annabeth Gish (<B><A HREF="x_files_tv_1993_2002.htm">THE
     X-FILES</A></B> - 2001-2002) both put in cameos. Based on a graphic 
    novel by Nick Thornborrow and A.J. Lieberman (who wrote the 
    screenplay as &quot;Andy Lieberman&quot;). Hard to believe that this 
    was a WWE production. Highly Recommended.;<A NAME="EvilWithin2016"></A> <B><A HREF="evil_within_2016.htm">THE
     EVIL WITHIN</A></B> (2016) is one of those films with a troubled 
    production history, but that doesn't mean it is a bad film. 
    Production of the film began in 2002, but was plagued by many delays 
    including: funding issues, conflicts with cast, and a lawsuit from a 
    studio assistant. After many stops and starts to the production, 
    filming was completed in 2008. Director/screenwriter Andrew Getty 
    (The grandson of billionaire Jean Paul Getty) began obsessing over 
    the final edit of the film and spent many years working to perfect 
    it, but he unfortunately died in 2015 (due to a hemorrhaging ulcer 
    caused by his ongoing methamphetamine addiction). before it could be 
    completed. Producer Michael Luceri, who had also assisted with the 
    editing, finished the film. It opens with Dennis (Frederick Koehler, 
    a very familiar face and under-rated actor on TV and films, such as <B><A HREF="death_race_2008.htm">DEATH
     RACE</A></B> - 2008 and it's first two <A HREF="death_race_2_2010.htm">DTV</A> <A HREF="death_race_3_inferno_2012.htm">sequels</A> 
    - 2010 &amp; 2013, with another one on the way in 2018) narrating his 
    dreams in a very inventive sequence (One where Michael Berryman; [<B><A HREF="hills_have_eyes_1977.htm">THE
     HILLS HAVE EYES</A></B> - 1977] unzips Dennis' back, does something 
    and zips it back up) that will bound to make you rewind the DVD 
    (especially when his mother takes off her sunglasses), ending with 
    him looking in a full length antique mirror. We then see Dennis in 
    real life having a picnic on his birthday with his brother John (Sean 
    Patrick Flanery; <B><A HREF="demon_hunter_2005.htm">DEMON HUNTER</A></B> 
    - 2005) and John's girlfriend Lydia (Dina Meyer; <B><A HREF="saw_franchise_2004-2010.htm">SAW
     I, II, III &amp; IV</A></B> - [2004 - 2007]). It is obvious Dennis 
    is slightly retarded, but when John gives him the mirror from his 
    dreams for his birthday (He tells Dennis he found it in a 
    &quot;Prohibition Vault&quot;), Dennis doesn't want it because it is 
    evil. John <A HREF="evil_within_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/evil within 2016 dvd front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="154" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>tries
     to talk him out of it, but Dennis screams for him to stop using 
    &quot;fifty cent words&quot;. The mirror is actually evil and begins 
    to affect Dennis' dreams. Dennis begins to talk to himself in the 
    mirror and sees things he would rather not see (Like Berryman biting 
    off the tips of his fingers, revealing his fingertip bones and then 
    slitting Dennis' throat). Dennis' reflection talks him into doing 
    many things. like killing the neighbor's cat and putting it in a 
    cooler. (His reflection tells him he is holding a new paint brush!). 
    John become suspicious when he notices that Dennis has VHS tapes 
    (showing its 2002 roots) on taxidermy, forensics and other subjects 
    (later on it changes from VHS tapes to books on tape) Dennis should 
    not be interested in and wonder what Dennis is building in the 
    basement since Dennis was never interested in carpentry (Dennis tells 
    John&nbsp; he will show him what he is doing in a couple of days). 
    Dennis is watching a documentary on venomous spiders when the 
    narrator says &quot;you fucking retard!&quot; and a giant spider 
    climbs on Dennis and sucks him dry until he is nothing but a 
    shriveled corpse. It was all a dream, of course, until Berryman 
    (Billed as the &quot;Cadaver&quot;) tells him through the mirror that 
    he will make all of it stop if he does him a favor: Kill a child. 
    Dennis kills a young boy on a swing and puts him in a freezer chest. 
    He sees himself in the mirror as not being retarded and his 
    non-retarded reflection tells him that all the things he sees in his 
    dreams are being whispered in his ear by him because where he is is 
    very dark. Dennis' reflection tells him as long as he is done what he 
    is told, he can come live where he is and his reflection can come 
    into the real world. His reflection convinces Dennis to become a 
    serial killer and his first intended victim is the girl at the 
    counter of the local ice cream parlor, Susan (Brianna Brown; <B><A HREF="night_of_the_living_dead_3d_2006.htm">NIGHT
     OF THE LIVING DEAD 3D</A></B> - 2006), who Dennis has a crush on. 
    Dennis scares the shit out of Susan and she runs out into the path of 
    an oncoming car and is killed (The whole scene is very well done and 
    has the feel of a nightmare). Meanwhile John asks Lydia to marry him, 
    but he finds out Lydia may be cheating on him (she isn't). Trying to 
    describe the rest of the film is just like trying to make sense of a 
    nightmare. It is indescribable, but it is also very watchable. 
    Frederick Koehler is a revelation here, managing to make you believe 
    he is both retarded and normal at the same time. This is also one of 
    those films where there is always something going on in the 
    background, so this is not a film you want to put on while vacuuming 
    your living room. This film demands all your attention. In other 
    words, a film that everyone should admire. This is as close to a 
    filmed nightmare as you can get. It doesn't surprise me that director 
    Andrew Getty had a methamphetamine addiction that killed him because 
    this is an extremely frenetic film with visuals that defy description 
    (like Dennis' favorite restaurant, where an anamatronic clown sings 
    and an octopus plays the drums!). John also seems to be having 
    psychiatric problems, as we see him talking to his psychiatrist, Dr. 
    Preston (Francis Guinan) on several occasions (We find out that John 
    pushed &quot;prodigy&quot; Dennis down a flight of stairs when they 
    were children, permanently damaging Dennis' brain), and it has 
    forever bothered him since it happened, making him as dependent on 
    Dennis as Dennis is dependent on him. John and Lydia go through a 
    &quot;Twilight Zone-ish&quot; experience. (There is a strange scene 
    where John and Lydia are at a restaurant and can't get anyone to 
    acknowledge them [Because Dennis killed everyone they know in town!]. 
    John confronts one guy and acts tough, but it turns out to be a giant 
    of a man who looks somewhat like Rhondo Hatton [Matthew McGrory of <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#House 1000 Corpses">HOUSE
     OF 1000 CORPSES</A></B> - 2003 and <B><A HREF="devils_rejects_2005.htm">THE
     DEVIL'S REJECTS</A></B> - 2005, who passed away in 2005, once again 
    a reminder of the film's troubled production history]) Unfortunately, 
    Michael Berryman has very few scenes in this film (he is prominently 
    displayed on the DVD Sleeve). But there are a lot of indescribable 
    scenes here (especially what happens to Lydia and the ending, which 
    can politely be said to be insane). If you like films that make you 
    feel creeped out, I can honestly say that this film is the one you 
    should watch. And in case you were wondering: Yes, there is some 
    blood, gore and female nudity, but this film is mostly about the 
    surreal visuals and the nudity is in no way titillating. One of the 
    best DTV films I have seen in a while. Look for Kim Darby (<B><A HREF="dont_be_afraid_of_the_dark_1973.htm">DON'T
     BE AFRAID OF THE DARK</A></B> - 1973) in an extended cameo as a

    performance by Nicolas Cage. But it<A HREF="arsenal_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/arsenal 2017 poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    works in this film. Ever since brothers Mikey and J.P. were young, 
    Mikey always looked out for his brother. He had a drunk father and an 
    old grandmother who was good for nothing. One day, Mikey comes home 
    and finds his father has blown half his face off with a shotgun. When 
    J.P. comes to enter the house, Mikey gives J.P. a bunch of quarters 
    to get him away from the house and to do his favorite thing: Go to 
    the arcade and play video games. When Mikey goes to the arcade to 
    pick up J.P. he accidentally spies Eddie King (Cage) killing a guy by 
    putting a baton in his mouth and hitting it with all his might with a 
    baseball bat. Eddie catches Mikey watching him and Mikey promises 
    that he saw nothing, so Eddie lets him go. 23 years pass and J.P. 
    (Adrian Grenier; <B><A HREF="entourage_the_movie_2015.htm">ENTOURAGE: 
    THE MOVIE</A></B> - 2015) is the head of a profitable construction 
    firm, while Mikey (Johnathon Schaech; <B><A HREF="culling_2014.htm">THE
     CULLING</A></B> - 2014) has just got out of the Marines on a 
    dishonorable discharge. Mikey is a total mess, divorced with one baby 
    girl. Mikey hits up J.P. for $10,000 to pay for rent and take care of 
    his little girl, but he buys a shitload of cocaine instead (&quot;Why 
    have $10,000 when you can turn it into $20,000.&quot; is what he says 
    to J.P. when he finds out what Mikey did thanks to his good friend 
    Sal (John Cusack; <B><A HREF="dragon_blade_2015.htm">DRAGON BLADE</A></B> 
    - 2015). A duo of masked robbers invade Mikey's house and steal the 
    cocaine, so now Mikey has nothing. The next day, someone with a 
    disguised voice over the phone demands $350,000 in three days for 
    Mikey's return. We find out that Mikey is doing it in cahoots with 
    Eddie (Mikey even has someone beat the shit out of his face to make 
    it look real), while J.P. and Sal look for him. Since they are 
    brothers, J.P. wants to sell his business, but his manager put all 
    the money from the company into building himself a new house. Eddie 
    (who is the disguised voice on the phone) lets Mikey talk to J.P. on 
    the phone and Mikey drops an important clue as to where he is (He had 
    second thoughts about screwing over his brother) and is almost killed 
    trying to get away, so Eddie kidnaps Mikey's ex-wife Alexis (Abbie 
    Gayle) to show he means business. J.P. manages to get the $350,000 
    (we see his manager wearing a neck brace!) and he also finds out that 
    Eddie King is behind it all. They say revenge is a dish best served 
    cold, but J.P. doesn't have that much time to wait for it to freeze, 
    so he picks up a gun and gets down to business. For once, this film 
    has a happy ending. Usually these films end up with some type of 
    tragedy happening, but not here. Director Steven C. Miller (<B><A HREF="scream_of_the_banshee_2011.htm">SCREAM
     OF THE BANSHEE</A></B>&nbsp; - 2011; <B><A HREF="silent_night_2012.htm">SILENT
     NIGHT</A></B> - 2012) makes sure the blood flows fast and freely, 
    Such as when Eddie beats his brother to death by punching his face to 
    a bloody pulp (while a gospel song plays on the radio) and the final 
    shootout is a thing of beauty, especially two scenes (Both in 
    slow-motion): J.P. blowing a guy's face off with a shotgun (better 
    than most horror films) and a bullet going through someone's cheek 
    (you see the bullet exiting his cheek). Screenwriter Jason Mosberg 
    (his first produced screenplay) gives John Cusack very little to do, 
    but everyone else figures importantly in the plot. Who says they 
    don't make good action movies any more? This one hooked me in from 
    the beginning. TRIVIA: Adrian Grenier and Johnathon Schaech both

    Speaking of Willis, I applaud HBO for showing director M. Night 
    Shyamalan's <B><A HREF="unbreakable_2000.htm">UNBREAKABLE</A></B> 
    (2000) before premiering Shyamalan's latest hit (one of the biggest 
    grossing films per dollar spent in 2017) <B><A HREF="split_2016.htm">SPLIT</A></B> 
    (2016). By HBO doing this, it shows that both films are intricately 
    linked, or like they say nowadays&nbsp; &quot;exist in the same 
    universe&quot;. You may have missed the connection when watching the 
    film, but I guarantee you won't miss it by the film's final shot 
    (both films end with the same line of dialogue and some scenes ape 
    the 2000 film.) in which a surprise visit will shock you. That is 
    Shyamalan for you, always throwing a twist into his films. He was 
    getting a bad rep until he started making low-budget films on his own 
    terms (This one for the notorious BlumHouse Productions, made for $9 
    million) and especially the goosebump-raising <B><A HREF="visit_2015.htm">THE

    2008) kidnaps three girls in their car in a store parking lot after 
    killing one of the girl's father and locks them in a room behind the 
    zoo he works at. The women Claire Benoit (Haley Lu Richardson), 
    Marcia (Jessica Sula) and especially Casey <A HREF="split_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/split 2016 poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Cooke
     (Anya Taylor-Joy), who has a history of mental and sexual abuse in 
    her childhood (as a young girl, she is raped by her brutish Uncle 
    John [Brad William Henke] when her cheerful father [Sebastian 
    Arcelus] dies at a young age. Like in <B>UNBREAKABLE</B>, Casey 
    points a gun at creepy Uncle John, but doesn't pull the trigger). 
    Dennis has multiple personality disorder and has 23 different 
    identities (we only see 8 in this film), but he tells his 
    psychiatrist Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley, who is simply 
    amazing) that a 24th personality is about to show itself, known as 
    &quot;The Beast&quot;, a muscular creature that is able to climb 
    walls. Dr. Fletcher finds all of this unbelievable, because no person 
    can change their appearance that much (Dennis is very thin) and no 
    one can climb walls. He makes plenty of unscheduled appearances at 
    Dr. Fletcher's office misleading her by saying he is not Dennis (He 
    is, because only Dennis uses a yellow cloth to clean the germs off 
    chairs and tables) and harping on the fact that The Beast is coming. 
    Casey knows how to deal with personalities like his and he really 
    does nothing to the girls (he does rape Marcia, and that is a 
    traumatic event) to mentally hurt them. Casey builds up Dennis' 
    respect for her (and she spots folders of all his personalities on 
    his computer, telling him on how to act like that personality (Is it 
    possible he is a fake?). Casey escapes and she ends up with Dr. 
    Fletcher, but Dennis does actually turn into the muscular Beast, 
    climbing the walls and squeezing Dr. Fletcher to death in a deadly 
    bear hug, while Casey frees the other two girls. We then see the 
    girls sitting at a diner counter when one of the girls says that 
    Dennis had some really freaky names (such as Hedwig), like that 
    person who caused the train wreck a few weeks ago. She can't remember 
    the name, so the man sitting next to her, David Dunn (Bruce Willis) 
    says simply &quot;Mr. Glass.&quot; Dennis is now at a crossroads in 
    his life , realizing that he can change his body with his mind, 
    making him invincible. We don't know where Shyamalan is going with 
    this film for half its running time, but he then springs two 
    surprises on us: The Beast and David Dunn from <B>UNBREAKABLE</B>. As 
    a matter of fact, Shyamalan is now directing a film called <B><A HREF="#Glass2019">GLASS</A></B> 
    (the <A HREF="glass_2019.htm#AdvancePoster">advance poster</A> is a 
    thing of beauty) for release in 2019, starring Willis, McAvoy, 
    Taylor-Joy and Samuel L. Jackson as the imprisoned Mr. Glass. This 
    promises to be one hell of a mash-up and I am so happy that Shyamalan 
    is once again getting the respect he deserves. See this film and try 
    to spot how many parallels you can make out between this and the 2000 
    film. My highest recommendation.</FONT></FONT></P>

    The film opens up with four high-tech robbers entering a branch of 
    the Hubert Bank and shotgunning its manager while stealing over 3 
    million dollars in cash. The bandits leave a bomb, telling the bank

    The bomb proves to be a fake, but it has the fingerprint of a dead 
    criminal, T.J. Jackson (Texas Battle; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#BoggyCreek2010">BOGGY

     (Christopher Meloni, who uses a lot of foul language, probably to 
    make up for all the times he couldn't use it on <B><A HREF="law_and_order_special_victims_unit_tv_series.htm">LAW
     &amp; ORDER: SVU</A></B>) and dirty Cincinatti Detective Mims 
    (Johnathon Schaech), whose wife is bedridden and dying of pancreatic 
    cancer. Somehow bank owner and president Mr. Hubert (Bruce Willis, in 
    what amounts to an extended cameo) is responsible for the robbers 
    (who wear metal skull masks and speak in electronic voices) for doing 
    what they do. It seems more like revenge rather than robbery. F.B.I. 
    Agent Wells (Adrian Grenier), who is new to Montgomery's team (which 
    includes Dave Bautista as Agent Stockwell and Lydia Hull as Agent 
    Chase) also looks like he knows more than he is telling and leaks 
    stories to news reporter Vanessa Adler (Tara Holt). The thieves 
    continue to rob branches of Hubert's banks, one time stealing 
    something out of a security deposit box and shooting the guard dead. 
    The boss of the robbers contacts Montgomery via laptop at his home 
    and tells Montgomery that those who died deserved it (at the second 
    robbery, the boss of the robbers stabs a seemingly innocent man 
    graphically in the throat outside the bank. What possibly could they 
    all have in common?). When Montgomery meets Hubert at his branch 
    office, the robbers strike again and Montgomery kills one of them and 
    gets in a tense Mexican standoff with the other three. Montgomery 
    says to take the money and go, just don't kill anyone else (Another 
    bank guard is shot in the head.). It looks like Mims and Montgomery 
    have something in common. Montgomery blames Mims for getting his wife 
    killed (&quot;My wife had her eyes cut out of her head while still 
    alive&quot; is what Montgomery says. His wife was an undercover DEA 
    agent whose cover was blown and Mims nearly got the person who did it 
    (T.J. Jackson) off of the charges when he lied on the stand during 
    the trial.). All of the plot points are resolved during the finale 
    and it doesn't end the way we think it will. I won't say anything 
    more, except director Steven C. Miller (<B><A HREF="automaton_transfusion_2006.htm">AUTOMATON

    shootouts and gory deaths and some genuine human emotions you usually 
    don't see in films of this type. This may be Bruce Willis' first DTV

    is a director to watch for in the future.;&nbsp; <B><A HREF="autopsy_of_jane_doe_2016.htm">THE
     AUTOPSY OF JANE DOE</A></B> (2016) is what a horror film should be: 
    scary, atmospheric and , most of all, engaging. I really don't 
    understand why such a horrifying film only gets a limited theatrical 
    release while PG-13 rated crap plays for weeks. This film opens with 
    the police at the scene of a mass murder in Virginia at a family 
    home. Everyone who lived in the home is brutally murdered (Lieutenant 
    Wade [Jane Perry] makes the observation &quot;It doesn't look like a 
    break-in, but rather the family was trying to break out&quot;). 
    Sheriff Burke (Michael McElhatton) is called down to the basement 
    where the corpse of a naked woman is found partially buried. She is 
    classified as a Jane Doe since she is naked and has no 
    identification. The body is taken to the home/mortuary of Tom (The 
    fantastic Brian Cox; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#TrickRTreat">TRICK 
    'R TREAT</A></B> - 2007; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Red2008">RED</A></B> 
    - 2008) and his son/assistant Austin (Emile Hirsch; <B><A HREF="darkest_hour_2011.htm">THE
     DARKEST HOUR</A></B> - 2011; <B><A HREF="once_upon_a_time_in_hollywood_2019.htm">ONCE
     UPON A TIME IN...HOLLYWOOD</A></B> - 2019) where Austin notices Jane 
    Doe's (played by Olwen Kelly) eyes are clouded gray. They also notice 
    that rigor has not taken place in her body and her wrists and ankles 
    were broken, like she was tortured. They also discover that her 
    tongue has been ripped out and there is peat under her fingernails 
    and toe nails. Tom is perplexed since peat is not found in Virginia, 
    but it is<A HREF="autopsy_of_jane_doe_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/autopsy of jane doe poster12 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="139" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    found further up north. They both think she was the victim of a 
    serial killer, but they will soon learn that is not the case. Tom 
    opens up Jane Doe's chest and blood comes pouring out, like she was 
    still alive. Tom assures his son that he has seen this happen before 
    (It happens due to gasses dead bodies produce, from pressure that 
    builds up and then the skin is punctured). After opening her chest 
    and using the rib spreader, Tom begins his internal autopsy. Jane 
    Doe's lungs are burned beyond recognition, but that would be 
    impossible since no other external or internal parts are burned. When 
    Tom opens her stomach, he finds an undigested poisonous plant and a 
    piece of cloth with the Roman numerals XXVII and a ritualistic 
    pentagram on it. Then things start to get weird. There is a big 
    thunderstorm outside and the power goes out, while the radio plays 
    the song &quot;Open Up Your Heart&quot; (by The Hamblens) all by 
    itself. The generator kicks in and Tom peels back her chest skin and 
    discovers the same ritualistic symbol found on the cloth is tattooed 
    inside her skin. How can that be? Austin discovers that if he folds 
    the cloth a certain way it spells out the word &quot;Leviticus&quot;. 
    Tom immediately knows that it is from the Bible, so he looks up 
    Leviticus 27, where it mentions the word &quot;witch&quot;. (Tom was 
    previously working on a body of an old man who had a bell tied around 
    his ankle just in case he was still alive, so everyone could hear it 
    ring.) Tom is attacked by something supernatural so he and Austin 
    head for the elevator where they hear the bell ringing. Tom grabs an 
    axe and buries it in what he thinks is the old man, but it turns out 
    he murders Austin's girlfriend Emma (Ophelia Lovibond), who was 
    supposed to meet Austin at 11:00 pm to go to a midnight movie. 
    Knowing that they are dealing with a witch, Austin pours flammable 
    liquid over Jane Doe's body and Tom lights up a matchbook and tosses 
    it on her body. The flames rise so high that it sets the entire room 
    on fire, so Tom whips out a fire extinguisher and puts the fire out, 
    only to discover Jane Doe is not burned at all. Austin opens her 
    skull with a bone saw, takes a piece of her brain and discovers the 
    brain cells are still alive. Tom makes the ultimate sacrifice for his 
    son (a really effective scene) after discovering that Jane Doe was a 
    witch from 16th centurty Salem, only to have Austin killed, too, in a 
    fall by trying to open the cellar door that will lead him outside. 
    The police arrive at the house/mortuary the next morning (turns out 
    there was no rain for four days) and they take away Tom, Austin and 
    Emma's bodies. Jane Doe gets her own ambulance and when the driver is 
    taking her body for another autopsy (Her body looks like it was never 
    touched), the radio starts playing &quot;Open Up Your Heart&quot;. It 
    looks like the ambulance driver is going to be Jane Doe's next 
    victim. I really can't describe how scary this film is, from a fly 
    buzzing out of Jane Doe's bloody nose, a refrigerated cold storage 
    door that keeps on opening by itself, to the hallways being filled 
    with smoke from Tom's dead cat Sydney (It was the only thing left to 
    remind Tom of his dead wife), which he throws into a furnace.

    - 2010)&nbsp; has made a film that should not be seen alone with the 
    lights out. Ian Goldberg &amp; Richard Naing's screenplay keeps you 
    guessing all the way. Olwen Kelly is brave to be shown totally naked 
    on the autopsy table and the autopsy looks just like a real one 
    (There are a lot of real scares in this film that I haven't even 
    touched on and this may be my favorite horror film of 2016). My 
    highest recommendation.; <B><A HREF="fender_bender_2016.htm">FENDER BENDER</A></B> 
    (2016) is one of those exceptional films made for the soon-to-be 
    defunct Chiller Channel (it will no longer exist on New Years Day 
    2018). The film opens with a women entering her house, talking on her 
    cell phone, telling her friend that she just had an accident with her 
    car but it was just a fender bender. She says she doesn't want to go 
    out that night. All she wants to do is go to sleep. She climbs into 
    bed, only to discover that a person dressed all in black leather and 
    a <A HREF="fender_bender_the_driver_photo_2016.htm">weird black mask</A> 
    is lying next to her. He stabs her in the throat and she is dead. 
    Turns out he is a serial killer known as The Driver (Bill Sage; <B><A HREF="we_are_what_we_are_2013.htm">WE
     ARE WHAT WE ARE</A></B> - 2013) and we next see him dressed in 
    street clothes buying gas for his car. He spends a weird amount of 
    money for the gas and lays it out on the counter, including coins. We 
    then switch to teenage ballerina Hilary (Makenzie Vega; <B><A HREF="saw_2004.htm">SAW</A></B> 
    - 2004) sitting in her car crying and&nbsp; talking to friend Rachel 
    (Dre Davis; <B><A HREF="pretty_little_liars_tv_series_2010.htm">PRETTY
     LITTLE LIARS</A></B> - 2010-2017) while in her mother's new car, 
    watching her boyfriend Andy (Harrison Sim) cheat on her. Rachel wants 
    her to confront him, but she is too late. Erik sees her behind the 
    wheel of the car and wants to explain, but a crying Hilary drives 
    away, saying they are through. She stops at a suburban intersection 
    to wipe away the tears, only to be rear-ended by The Driver. They 
    exchange names, insurance information and phone numbers and Hilary <A HREF="fender_bender_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/fender bender poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>takes
     photos of the damage to both cars and of The Driver on her phone for 
    insurance purposes. When Mom and Dad see the damage to mom's new car, 
    they ground her and say that she is forbidden to go to a ballerina 
    concert that she was looking forward to with her mother. Mom and Dad 
    head out to the concert without Hilary and Dad says to contact the 
    insurance company to report the damage (&quot;It's the least you can 
    do for your mother!&quot;). Hilary does that and gives her insurance 
    agent all the information given to her by The Driver. The serial 
    killer then begins to text her, saying how sorry he was for hitting 
    her car (He is using all the information Hilary gave him to his 
    advantage, including her address.). Rachel and gay friend Erik 
    (Steven Kelsey Leos Montoya) pay a surprise visit to Hilary to show 
    that they are real friends and support her decision for dumping Andy 
    for cheating on her. They order a pizza and find it lying next to the 
    front door. Rachel and Erik eat the pizza and Andy (who is drunk) 
    knocks on the front door, demanding that Hilary takes him back, but 
    she pushes him out of the front door and slams it shut. She gets a 
    frightening phone call from the insurance agent, who tells her that 
    the information she provided about The Driver is that of a woman who 
    was murdered the night before (The woman we saw in the beginning of 
    the film). Hilary immediately gets worried when the leather-bound The 
    Driver enters the house and murders Rachel and Erik by slitting their 
    throats (They can't get away from him because the pizza was drugged 
    and he also murdered Andy). He turns his attention to Hilary, but she 
    proves to be a difficult catch (probably due to her ballerina 
    training). She whacks The Driver on the head several times with a 
    tire iron in her garage and then pours a jug of gasoline all over his 
    black leather outfit. She tries to set him on fire by striking a 
    match, but he gets up before she has time to throw it at him. In the 
    film's most tense scene, Hilary hits him in the head a few more times 
    and enters The Driver's car and pushes the lighter in his 70's car 
    down to charge it (Remember those cigarette lighters next to the 
    ashtray in older cars?). The suspense builds (it is palpable) while 
    Hilary waits for the lighter to pop-up while The Driver makes it to 
    his feet and begins to approach the car. The lighter finally pops-up 
    and she throws it at The Driver and he is set aflame. He manages to 
    put out the fire by rolling around in a puddle, but he is either dead 
    or unconscious. Hilary cautiously approaches The Driver's body 
    because she sees that he has her phone (which also contains his image 
    from the accident. She goes into her house after seeing all of her 
    friend's bodies posed in peculiar ways. The Driver meets her in the 
    house and stabs her dead, removes his leather gear (and also 
    protective headgear under the mask, which is why he could take hits 
    to the head with a tire iron) and takes a shower. He then goes 
    through Hilary's pocketbook and takes all the money in her wallet 
    (including the coins). He drives to a gas station (his car now has 
    the license plates of Mom's new car (It reads &quot;DNCEMOM&quot;) 
    and buys an amount of gas that is the exact amount of money he took 
    from Hilary's wallet. He puts the money on the gas station's counter, 
    including the coins (Now we know why he did such a strange thing in 
    the beginning of the film). In this film, the bad guy wins and all 
    the innocent ones die. Bill Sage is completely frightening inside his 
    leather costume and out of it. His first encounter with Hilary is a 
    really tense moment and you don't know what is going to happen when 
    she takes his picture, but you do know that he is her next victim. 
    This was the first directing effort by Mark Pavia in 19 years, his 
    last film being 1997's <B><A HREF="night_flier_1997.htm">THE NIGHT FLIER</A></B>,
     based on a Stephen King story. While it contains no nudity and very 
    little foul language, it does have its fair share of gory moments, 
    especially when The Driver stabs Erik in the neck and the blood 
    squirts like a water fountain. While no reason is given why The 
    Driver does what he does (the inside of his car's hood is full of the 
    driver licences of his victims and there are about of 100 of them, 
    with Hilary's being the newest) there is plenty of edge of your seat 
    suspense, especially the sequence of Hilary pressing the car's 
    cigarette lighter and discovering the drivers licences over her head. 
    While nothing spectacular, this is a smart little slasher film that 
    hits all the right notes. You really don't get that too often.; I 
    really didn't initially know what to think of <B><A HREF="it_stains_the_sands_red_2016.htm">IT
     STAINS THE SAND RED</A></B> (2016), another zombie film, but its 
    outrageous ideas and situations won me over. It was directed by Colin 
    Minihan, one half of &quot;The Vicious Brothers&quot;, who gave us 
    the boring found footage film <B><A HREF="grave_encounters_2011.htm">GRAVE
     ENCOUNTERS</A></B> (2011), but partner Stuart Ortiz co-wrote the 
    twisty screenplay with Minihan (they both also co-produced this), 
    turning this film into a refreshing new take on the zombie genre. It 
    opens with coked-out and vodka-soused stripper Molly (Brittany Allen; <B><A HREF="saw_franchise_2004-2010.htm">JIGSAW</A></B> 
    - 2017, who is terrific here) driving in the Nevada desert, heading 
    for Las Vegas via Porsche with her gangster boyfriend Nick (Merwin 
    Mondesir). Too much vodka forces Nick to pull over to the side of the 
    road so Molly can throw up, but when she gets back in, Nick finds his 
    expensive car is<A HREF="it_stains_the_sands_red_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/it stains the sand red 2016 poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    stuck hopelessly in the sand (Porsches have real-wheel drive). They 
    see a person walking in the middle of the road and it turns out to be 
    a zombie (Juan Riedinger, who is also great), so Nick runs to his 
    car, pulls out a Glock and begins shooting at him. Even a bullet in 
    the head doesn't stop him, so Nick and Molly hide out in the car. The 
    zombie is relentless and doesn't stop trying to get into the car 
    until well into the night. Nick dropped his phone outside the car, so 
    when the zombie disappears, he goes outside to get it, only to become 
    the next meal. While the zombie is chowing down on Nick's intestines, 
    Molly runs out into the desert to get away, only to find out zombies 
    do not get tired like normal humans. Trapped on a rock, she feeds the 
    zombie, who she has named &quot;Smalls&quot; (for &quot;Small 
    Dick&quot;). her bloody tampon (!) to satiate his thirst for blood, 
    giving her time to escape. The zombie continues following her, so she 
    begins to talk to him like a normal person and will soon find out 
    that a zombie is the least of her problems. A sandstorm appears, 
    trapping Molly and Smalls in it and when it ends, she discovers a 
    pickup truck parked on the side of a road containing two men. Molly 
    soon finds out that these men are actually the people Nick was 
    supposed to meet at an airport on the outskirts of Vegas and one of 
    them begins raping her in the bed of the pickup. But Smalls rises 
    from the sand and saves Molly's ass, chewing on the rapist's neck, 
    while the other one drives away in fear. Molly also discovers that 
    Smalls is not the only zombie, as one of the men tells her it is a 
    different world now. Smalls actually becomes Molly's deadly friend 
    and she tries to protect him from a military Hummer platoon sent to 
    kill all the zombies (She uses Smalls as a means to carry her supply 
    of Vodka and cocaine buy putting a car tire around him and tying a 
    rope to the tire so he can pull a rubber raft with her supplies!). 
    Two Army men want to kill Smalls but Molly intervenes, standing in 
    front of the zombie and trying to talk them into not shooting him. 
    She is partially successful (one of the Army men shoots Smalls in the 
    leg as he is getting back in the Humvee), but Smalls bites her 
    finger. Fearing she is infected, she chops off her finger by slamming 
    a sharp rock on it until she no longer has it. Smalls can no longer 
    walk, so Molly does the human thing and crushes Small's head in with 
    a boulder! It turn out Molly has a young son and she will do anything 
    to get back to him. She walks the 30 miles to the airport, where 
    Molly's contact refuses to take her to her son (he takes off in a 
    plane without her). Molly finds a working car, but not before she has 
    to deal with a couple of zombies (She uses a portable drill on one 
    zombie's head). She drives to pick up her son, only to discover that 
    the neighborhood is in shambles. Is her son alive? You'll have to 
    watch the film to find out. I have to say it was hard to see Smalls 
    get killed. He kind of reminded me of &quot;Bub&quot; in George 
    Romero's <B><A HREF="day_of_the_dead.htm">DAY OF THE DEAD</A></B> 
    (1985) in his mannerisms and actions. While not a complete gorefest, 
    it does get bloody at times, especially during the zombie attack 
    scenes (Effects done by Ryan Nicholson of <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Gutterballs">GUTTERBALLS</A></B> 
    [2008] and <B><A HREF="collar_2014.htm">COLLAR</A></B> [2014] fame), 
    which is why this film was released Unrated. But this film is more 
    interested in the human angle, as we witness what is most important 
    to Molly in the beginning of the film: her cocaine and vodka. She 
    risks her life to retrieve a bottle of Vodka and yells at Smalls when 
    he interrupts her snorting coke and spilling it all over the sand. It 
    is not until she begins to look at Smalls as something other than a 
    zombie that she begins to think about her son. He bring out the true 
    Molly, not as a coked-out stripper, but as a mother. Director Minihan (<B><A HREF="extraterrestrial_2014.htm">EXTRATERRESTRIAL</A></B> 
    - 2014; also featuring Brittany Allen, but not near as good as this 
    film) does a nice job on turning the zombie genre on its head and 
    giving us an emotional film that should resonate with viewers. It is 
    also left wide open for a sequel. Worth checking out.;<A NAME="Barn2016"></A> 
    I have had the Blu-Ray of <B><A HREF="barn_2016.htm">THE BARN</A></B> 
    (2016) for nearly three years, yet I just watched it in the week 
    approaching Halloween 2019. While it is badly scripted and acted, 
    there's no denying that it has a certain '80s charm that will win you 
    over. Oh, and it's gory as hell. Really gory. A group of six overage 
    teenagers decide to have one more Halloween blast before they become 
    adults and accept responsibility for their lives. Sam (Mitchell 
    Musolino) and Josh (Will Stout), best friends since they were little 
    kids, are the biggest fans of Halloween and decide to kill two birds 
    with one stone by collecting candy for the tight-assed church lady 
    Ms. Barnhart (a cameo by Linnea Quigley) and going to a rock concert 
    on Halloween Night (hearing about the rock concert on TV from Dr. 
    Rock, played by Ari Lehman [the original Jason Vorhees in <B><A HREF="friday_the_13th_1980.htm">FRIDAY
     THE 13TH</A></B> - 1980]). They bring along Sam's childhood crush 
    Michelle (Lexi Dripps), friend Russell (Nickolaus Joshua), as well as 
    Chris (Cortland Woodard) and his girlfriend Nikki (Nikki Darling), 
    for the ride and stop at a strange town to do their 
    trick-or-treating. But they stop at a barn first and do something 
    really stupid. They do a chant at the barn, which wakes up three 
    demons from Hell: The Boogeyman, Hallowed Jack and The Candycorn 
    Scarecrow. They then go to town and collect their candy, not knowing 
    that the three demons are now loose and killing everyone they come in 
    contact with, first killing Chris and Nikki as they are having sex in 
    a tent in a cornfield. That's all there really is to the film, but 
    the kills are very gory, as heads are ripped off, various appendages 
    removed by force and everyone is graphically slaughtered at a 
    hootenanny. The finale takes place back at the barn, as survivors 
    Sam, Josh and Michelle battle the demons and the Preacher (Rik 
    Billock) who is using the townspeople as sacrifices to the demons so 
    their crops will be fruitful (Sam says to the Preacher, &quot;I 
    thought you believed in God!&quot; The Preacher replies, &quot;I do 
    believe in God. Just not yours!&quot;). While not a good film by 
    anyone's definition, it is enjoyable bloody fluff that does manage to 
    entertain, despite the bad acting and nonsensical script. 
    Director/screenwriter/editor and jack-of-all trades Justin M. Seaman 
    (who also portrays The Boogeyman) has turned in a film that is full 
    of very gory practical effects (some CGI is used, especially the fire 
    in Hallowed Jack's pumpkin-faced eyes), where nothing is hidden from 
    view, making this a good film to watch on Halloween (<B><A HREF="phantasm_1979.htm">PHANTASM</A></B> 
    [1979] has always been a Halloween tradition for me and this film 
    won't change that). Financed by crowdfunding site Indiegogo, director

    destination. The members of importance are owner Venus Virgo (Meg 
    Foster; <B><A HREF="they_live_1988.htm">THEY LIVE</A></B> - 1988), 
    manager Panda Thomas (Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Chance">CHANCE</A></B> 
    - 1990), dancer Charly (Sheri Moon Zombie; Rob Zombie's <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#House 1000 Corpses">HOUSE
     OF 1000 CORPSES</A></B> - 2002; and every other film he has made 
    since), engineer/mechanic Roscoe Pepper (Zombie's <B><A HREF="#ThreeFromHell2019">3
     FROM HELL</A></B> - 2019) and jack-of-all-trades Levon Wally (Kevin 
    Jackson; <B><A HREF="spider_man_2002.htm">SPIDER-MAN</A></B> - 2002). 
    They stop at a gas station run by Lucky Leo (a near-toothless Tracey 
    Walter; <B><A HREF="repo_man_1984.htm">REPO MAN</A></B> - 1984) and 
    Charly gets freaked-out by a mechanical puppet show Leo puts on at a 
    building's entrance. They continue on their way, when they run into 
    some strange roadblocks in the road during the middle of the night. 
    They get out to remove them, when they are attacked, kidnapped and 
    drugged by some masked assailants. Everyone else in the roadshow, 
    except for the five members I have mentioned, are savagely murdered. 
    When Venus, Charly, Roscoe, Panda and Levon wake up, they are all 
    tied up and Father Murder (Malcolm McDowell; Zombie's <B><A HREF="halloween_2007.htm">HALLOWEEN</A></B> 
    - 2007), introduces them to Sister Serpent (Jane Carr; <B><A HREF="crazy_as_hell_2002.htm">CRAZY
     AS HELL</A></B> - 2002) and Sister Dragon (Judy Geeson; Zombie's <B><A HREF="lords_of_salem_2012.htm">LORDS
     OF SALEM</A></B> - 2012) and tells them that they are about to play 
    a game called &quot;31&quot; in a building he calls 
    &quot;MurderWorld&quot;, saying they have 12 hours to play the game, 
    12 hours to kill and 12 hours to survive. Anyone who survives will be 
    set free (Father and the two Sisters are dressed in opulent 
    18th-Century garb, complete with large white powder wigs!). He 
    assigns each five members a number, their odds of winning the game 
    and the odds are extremely low (Charly's odds are 500-to-1). They 
    then are untied and handed simple weapons (a baseball bat, a 2x4, an 
    iron pipe, etc. Guns aren't allowed in this game on either side 
    because it would be too easy to win.). Their first opponent will be 
    Sick-Head (Pancho Moler; <B><A HREF="3_from_hell_2019.htm">3 FROM HELL</A></B> 
    - 2019), a dwarf dressed in full Hitler regalia (including a Hitler 
    mustache!) who speaks Spanish (!) and wields two very sharp daggers. 
    No one is allowed to leave Murderworld, as all the doors are locked 
    (There seems to be no outside windows in this building, as it looks 
    to be some abandoned warehouse). After some serious taunting, 
    Sick-Head kills Levon with his trusty daggers, before Charly and 
    Venus subdue him, Venus killing him with his own daggers, stabbing 
    him over and over in some kind of bloodlust trance for murdering 
    Levon. A short time later, Father Murder announces over the intercom 
    that he has a nice final meal prepared for them and when the foursome 
    enter the room, there's a table with a huge spread of different foods 
    on it. Charly and Venus refuse to eat it, but Panda immediately does, 
    telling them that poison is not a way of death in this game, it's a 
    &quot;kill or be killed&quot;-type of game, so they better eat 
    something because it's better to kill on a full stomach. Roscoe joins 
    him, but Charly is still unsure. Turns out she is right, for, as she 
    pulls the tablecloth off the table, it reveals that Levon's 
    disemboweled body is directly below the glass table, and the meat 
    they are eating may be Levon's! After listening to Father Murder 
    laugh (and Panda and Roscoe puking their guts out), they are 
    introduced to their next two opponents: Psycho-Head (Lew Temple; <B><A HREF="zombex_2013.htm">ZOMBEX</A></B> 
    - 2013) and Schizo-Head (David Ury; <B><A HREF="revenant_2009.htm">THE
     REV</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="revenant_2009.htm">E</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B><A HREF="revenant_2009.htm">NANT</A></B> 
    - 2009), chainsaw-carrying psychopath brothers who promise to 
    skull-fuck Charly and Venus before killing them (in typical 
    Zombie-style &quot;White Trash&quot; dialogue). The foursome run away 
    and find a room called the &quot;Wet Kitty&quot; (I think we know 
    what Zombie is trying to convey here!), where they find a woman 
    called Georgina (Devin Sidell) tied to the floor. Georgina says if 
    they free her she knows a way to escape, but Roscoe thinks it's a 
    trap. Turns out it is, but not in the way Roscoe thinks. The room is 
    nothing but a large iron cage and Venus and Roscoe become trapped in 
    it, while Charly and Panda are outside, unable to free them. Both 
    duos are then attacked, Charly and Panda by Schizo-Head and Venus and 
    Roscoe by Psycho-Head (he's been hiding under some hay in the cage). 
    what happens next is probably Rob Zombie's best edited scene in any 
    of his films (and I've seen them all), as we cut back and forth 
    between the two duos as they battle the chainsaw psychopath brothers. 
    Psycho-Head kills Georgina and then turns his attention to Venus, but 
    Roscoe turns heroic and makes Venus stand behind him as he fights 
    Psycho with a metal pipe. Panda is cut on the side by Schizo's 
    chainsaw, but both duos defeat their opponents. Psycho-Head falls on 
    his own chainsaw, cutting his body in half (Venus lays on his body so 
    he can't get up while the 'saw rips into his body) and Panda is able 
    to grab the chainsaw away from Schizo-Head when he sees his brother 
    being killed. Schizo pleads for his life, telling Panda and Charly 
    that he is just like them, he was forced to take this role in the 
    game, but Panda is not buying it, using the chainsaw to cut open 
    Schizo-Head's stomach, killing him. The cage door then opens and 
    Father Murder announces that they won again, only this time their 
    odds of winning are multiplied (Charly's is now a million-to-one). 
    Both Roscoe and Panda were seriously wounded in the battle (Roscoe 
    has a gaping chainsaw wound on his left arm), so the women tend to 
    them. Their next opponents are the giant, white tutu-wearing, German 
    man Death-Head (Thorsten Voges; <B><A HREF="8mm_1999.htm">8MM</A></B> 
    - 1999) and the tiny female Sex-Head (E.G. Daily; Zombie's <B><A HREF="devils_rejects_2005.htm">THE
     DEVIL'S REJECTS</A></B> - 2005; Roscoe knows who Sex-Head is since 
    he met her a Lucky Leo's gas station, but without her clown makeup). 
    Death-Head's weapon of choice is a large wooden club with huge metal 
    spikes sticking out of it and Sex-Head's is a length of chain that 
    she uses as a whip. Death-Head kills Panda with his club, but when 
    Roscoe appears with Sex-Head's chain wrapped around her neck, 
    Death-Head drops his club and pleads for Sex-Head's life (he loves 
    her!). Venus picks up the club and kills Death-Head, while Roscoe 
    strangles Sex-Head with the chain (If you are paying close attention, 
    all of the &quot;Head&quot;s are killed with their own weapons, at 
    least up until now). Father Murder and the two Sisters are now very 
    worried. They did not expect this group of &quot;victims&quot; to be 
    such ruthless fighters. They call in their only other choice: 
    Doom-Head, their best killer, who has never lost a game (his weapons 
    of choice are two switchblade knives). Want to find out how it ends? 
    Well, you are just going to have to watch the film, but I guarantee 
    this: You will never listen to Steven Tyler's &quot;Dream On&quot; 
    the same way ever again! This film has much to recommend, including 
    the lengthy documentary on the DVD/Blu-Ray, which runs longer than 
    the film itself (a Rob Zombie trademark), where you will learn many 
    interesting facts about why Zombie made this film. Zombie got the 
    idea for this film when he read a story about more people 
    disappearing on Halloween than any other day of the year. He doubts 
    the story's authenticity, <A HREF="31_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/31 amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>but
     he thought it would make a good film. He set the film in the '70s 
    because that was the decade he grew up in, saying those who never 
    experienced that decade could never understand how special it was. I 
    agree whole-heartedly. It's one of the reasons why I started this 
    website in the first place. What amazed me most is that he filmed the 
    dual chainsaw attacks in less than 8 hours, something that would take 
    most directors more than a week to film, yet it looks terrific, the 
    best thing Zombie has ever done. The editing in this scene is simply 
    jaw-dropping. Zombie crowdfunded this film on the Internet since no 
    studio would finance it and it looks terrific for a film made with 
    less than a million dollars. He had to edit the film three times 
    before the MPAA would give the film an R-Rating. Unfortunately, this 
    R-Rated version is what Lionsgate Entertainment released on DVD &amp; 
    Blu-Ray, but it is still quite violent (At the time, Zombie said it 
    was the most &quot;brutal&quot; film he ever made and I would have to 
    agree with that.). Hey, I know a lot of people don't like Zombie's 
    films and I can understand that. He's a polarizing figure, yet I love 
    every film he has ever directed. They are unlike any other films 
    being made today. If you are a Zombie fan, I suggest you search this 
    film out. If you are an Amazon Prime member, they offer it streaming 
    for free. Otherwise, the DVDs and Blu-rays are readily available at 
    an extremely affordable price. Just see it! Also featuring porn star

    - 1989) as Cherry Bomb, a woman Doom-Head is fucking when he gets a 
    phone call from Father Murder to come to MurderWorld to dispose of 
    the victims who are still surviving. Richard Brake is absolutely 
    frightening and terrifically devious and brutal as Doom-Head, the 
    highlight performance in this film. How he prepares himself for 31 is 
    certainly an eye-opener and not easily forgotten (It involves lots of 
    self-abuse!). The reveal on who Father Murder and the two Sisters 
    really are is also quite surprising (They're just bored millionaires 
    who put the game together every Halloween just for shits and 
    giggles!).; <B><A HREF="i_had_a_bloody_good_time_at_house_harker_2016.htm">I
     HAD A BLOODY GOOD TIME AT HOUSE HARKER</A></B><A NAME="HouseHarker2016"></A> 
    (2016) is one of those rare birds: A Kickstarter funded film that 
    actually works, mixing broad comedy with bloody practical makeup 
    effects (very little CGI is employed here when it comes to the 
    killings). The story is rather simple, yet ingenious. In the year 
    1812, Jonathan Harker killed Dracula, the Master Vampire. Without the 
    Master's power, vampires were no longer able to turn humans into 
    vampires with a bite on the neck. Harker burned Dracula's body and 
    destroyed the bones, except for Dracula's skull, which he kept. The 
    Harker family then left Romania and settled in a small midwestern 
    town in the United States, making sure to keep Dracula's skull hidden 
    from all mankind and vampires alike. In the present day, the 
    remaining Harker family, which includes Gerry (Jacob Givens), his 
    slightly retarded brother Charlie (Noel Carroll) and pretty sister 
    Paige (Whitney Moore), are about to lose their house because Gerry 
    blew the $50,000 given to them to fix up house and give it landmark 
    status on a cheapjack stage play about the Harker family. The Harker 
    family name is nothing but a joke in this unnamed small town (Gerry 
    once found short-lived fame as a baton twirler in a Lifetime 
    Movie-like film called <B>TWIRL</B> and the townspeople never let him 
    forget it!), but Gerry must find a way to keep the house before he 
    defaults on the loan. Gerry's best friend Ned (Derek Haugen), a 
    wood-obsessed chainsaw sculptor (!) who has the hots for Paige even 
    though she is engaged to the town's Sheriff Wayne (Nathan Lorch), 
    comes up with an idea of how to get the money. A series of 
    coincidences gives the Harker family a reason to celebrate. A serial 
    killer is on the loose and breaks into the Harker home, only to be 
    accidentally killed by a knife gag that was used in the stage play. 
    Ned uses a shopvac to&nbsp; suck up all the blood on the floor before 
    Paige sees it (she has no idea that they about to lose their home), 
    but when he leaves the room, the hose gets stuck<A HREF="i_had_a_bloody_good_time_at_house_harker_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/i had a bloody good time at house harker amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    on the serial killer's knife wound, sucking every drop of blood out 
    of his body. Ned gets the idea of dumping the body and spreading word 
    around town that a real vampire is on the loose and the Harkers set 
    up their home as a haunted house, tricking it out with an assortment 
    of gags (such as crucifixes attached to all the windows and doors so 
    vampires can't escape the house) and inviting the town to experience 
    a real vampire for one night only, hoping to collect the $50,000 to 
    keep their home (Charlie and Gerry are lousy at math, charging $10.00 
    a person for admittance into the house, which means that 5,000 people 
    would have to come to this &quot;one night only&quot; event for them 
    to pay off the loan!). They ask their friend Peter (Allen Cragin), an 
    actor, to portray the vampire for their haunted house. What they 
    don't count on is that a real vampire from Romania is one the way to 
    this small town, determined to destroy the Harkers once and for all. 
    When the vampire discovers Dracula's skull, he inhales it (!) and is 
    given the Master's powers, now being able to turn humans into 
    vampires with a single bite. Nearly the entire town shows up for the 
    haunted house, not knowing that the real vampire is in the basement 
    of the house. What happens next is a real bloody good time, as Gerry, 
    Charlie, Paige, Ned and Walter (Arlan Godthaab), the Harkers' next 
    door neighbor and a former priest (He left the priesthood after 
    continually getting puked on by possessed people in every exorcism he 
    performed, a funny flashback sequence where pea soup is thrown up on 
    him over and over) must find a way to destroy this vampire once and 
    for all. Will they succeed? While unevenly acted, this is still a 
    very funny film with some very good bloody practical effects, such as 
    when any vampire is staked in the heart, they don't just die, they 
    explode in a heavy spray of blood. Directed by first-timer Clayton 
    Cogswell and written by the cast, who are part of a collective comedy 
    group known as &quot;Good Cops&quot; (they have a popular YouTube 
    channel called &quot;<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/user/GoodCopsTV">GoodCopsTV</A>&quot;),
     this is a very funny film that skewers all of the modern day vampire 
    tropes, including sparkling vampires and author Stephenie Meyer's <B><A HREF="twilight_2008.htm">TWILIGHT</A></B> 
    series of books and films. Nothing is off limits here, but it is done 
    so humorously, I doubt even Meyer would be offended. While the 
    effects are very gory and bloody, they are done comedically, so I 
    think those who are turned off by gore will still enjoy this 
    film.&nbsp; While I generally don't care much for humorous horror 
    flicks, this very low-budget hidden gem should be on your must-see 
    list of films to be viewed. Any film that uses the Right Said Fred 
    tunes &quot;Lord Have Mercy&quot; and &quot;I Love My Car&quot; into 
    the plot is okay in my book! Available streaming for free on Amazon 
    Prime, if you are a Prime member. Yet another excellent reason to

     DTV Genre Films Part 20a (continued):<A NAME="Devil'sGate2016"></A> 
    I love alien abduction films, especially if they are done right. One 
    excellent example is <B><A HREF="devils_gate_2016.htm">DEVIL'S GATE</A></B> 
    (2016), a real mindfuck of a film that hits you with so many lefts, 
    you'll be begging for a right (Sorry, Chuck Norris!), but you'll get 
    not a single one. In the dusty North Dakota town of Devil's Gate, 
    something strange is going on at the old Pritchard Farm. As a driver 
    is passing the farm, his car suddenly stops working, so he goes to 
    the old, decrepit Prichard Farm to ask for help, since his cell phone 
    has no service (an old horror trope, but it is explained resonably 
    here). The main house and barn look deserted and boarded-up, but the 
    man hears a voice coming from the house's basement, so he looks in 
    the window and is scared out of his wits. He tries running away, but 
    he steps on a hidden bear trap. As he removes the trap from his leg, 
    he tries running away again, only to step on another booby-trap and 
    is killed when spikes made of rebar puncture every part of his body 
    (a quick bloody &amp; gory death that will make you wince). Jackson 
    Pritchard (Milo Ventimiglia; <B><A HREF="divide_2011.htm">THE DIVIDE</A></B> 
    - 2011) then walks outside and buries the man's body. The big 
    question remains: Why does Jackson have his farm tricked out with 
    booby traps and barb wire everywhere? We then switch to F.B.I. Agent 
    Daria Francis (a very good Amanda Schull; TV's <B><A HREF="12_monkeys_tv_series_2015.htm">12
     MONKEYS</A></B> [2015 - 2018]) landing at Devil's Gate's small 
    airport and meeting Deputy Conrad Salter (an equally good Shawn 
    Ashmore; <B><A HREF="day_2011.htm">THE DAY</A></B> - 2011), who tells 
    her to call him &quot;Colt&quot; (&quot;Everyone calls me that.&quot;)
     and then drives her to meet Sheriff Gruenwell (a nearly 
    unrecognizable Jonathan Frakes; <B><A HREF="star_trek_the_next_ generation_tv_series_1987-1994.htm">STAR
     TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION</A></B> [1987 - 1994]). Daria is in 
    Devil's Gate to investigate the disappearance of Jackson Pritchard's 
    wife Maria (Bridget Regan; <B><A HREF="john_wick_2014.htm">JOHN WICK</A></B> 
    - 2014) and young son Jonah (Spencer Drever), who have been missing 
    for over three days. Daria specifically asked to be put in charge of 
    this case because she is a new F.B.I. agent and her first case ended 
    very badly (She found a missing girl and brought her home, but the 
    girl committed suicide in front of Daria, because her father was 
    sexually abusing her at home, which is why she ran away. Daria is 
    haunted by the fact that the girl killed <A HREF="devils_gate_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/devil's gate poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>herself,
     even though the girl never told her the reason she ran away.). 
    Sheriff Gruenwell is not too pleased that Daria is in Devil's Gate 
    and orders her not to talk to Jackson; they already questioned him 
    and came to the conclusion that he had nothing to do with Maria or 
    Jonah's disappearance. Sheriff Gruenwell tells Colt (who went to high 
    school with Jackson) to take Daria to Maria's sister's house to 
    question her, but he is in no way to take her to Jackson's farm (The 
    Sheriff then mysteriously says to Daria, &quot;Some missing people 
    should never be found.&quot;). After questioning Maria's sister, 
    Theresa (Sarah Constible; <B><A HREF="haunting_in_connecticut_2009.htm">THE
     HAUNTING IN CONNECTICUT</A></B> - 2009), and finding a notebook that 
    Jonah hid in the closet Theresa&nbsp; set up for him (&quot;It's the 
    only place he felt safe.&quot; says Theresa. She then tells Daria 
    that her sister and her son would spend a lot of time at her house 
    since Jackson's temperment suddenly changed for the worst when Jonah 
    was born), Daria tells a reluctant Colt to take her to Jackson's 
    farm, showing him the notebook, which contains weird drawings of 
    strange symbols and a hand-drawn picture of Jackson abusing Maria and 
    Jonah (although the drawing can be interpreted much differently). 
    Colt takes her there and is surprised to see Jackson's farm all 
    tricked out with booby traps and barb wire, telling Daria that none 
    of it was there three days ago when he and the Sheriff questioned 
    Jackson. Jackson then comes out of his house pointing a shotgun at 
    Daria's head. Daria disarms him and Colt slaps on the handcuffs, but 
    Jackson swears he had nothing to do with his wife and son's 
    disappearance. He tells them that he is alone at the farm, but a 
    noise can be heard coming from the house's basement, so Daria goes 
    into the house (almost setting off a crossbow booby trap) while 
    Jackson begs her not to go inside. What Daria discovers in the 
    basement in a large barred cell will change her beliefs in everything 
    explainable. Jackson has captured an alien (but Jackson, who is 
    uber-religious, calls it a &quot;fallen angel&quot;) and is holding 
    it hostage. The &quot;fallen angels&quot; have taken Maria and Jonah 
    away and Jackson is keeping the alien in exchange for his wife and 
    son. What happens next is surprisingly creepy and is best if you 
    discover it for yourself (even though some of the major clues are in 
    this review). Director/co-writer (with Peter Aperlo) Clay Staub (His 
    only directorial credit at the time of this review, although he was 
    Second Unit Director on the remake of <B><A HREF="dawn_of_the_dead_2004.htm">DAWN
     OF THE DEAD</A></B> [2004] and <B><A HREF="thing_2010.htm">THE THING</A></B> 
    [2010] prequel) has fashioned a film that is full of unexpected 
    twists &amp; turns and surprises, many of which I never saw coming. 
    The alien designs are fantastic and frightening and the deaths are 
    very gory and flinch-worthy (what happens to one major character is 
    something I have never saw done before in a film!), as is the acting 
    from everyone involved. If you love movies that deal with alien 
    abduction (like <B><A HREF="fire_in_the_sky_1993.htm">FIRE IN THE SKY</A></B> 
    - 1993 and <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#AlmostHuman2013">ALMOST HUMAN</A></B>

     on your must-see list. It will not disappoint you.;&nbsp; Does<A NAME="Terrifier2016"></A>

    spine? If not, you haven't watched <B><A HREF="terrifier_2016.htm">TERRIFIER</A></B> 
    (2016), one of the best slasher movies of the New Millennium, with a 
    knowing wink to slasher films of the '80s. This is also one of the 
    most graphically violent films out there, leaving very little to the 
    imagination. Unlike like most modern-day slasher flicks, which 
    ladle-on the cliches one after the other, this film uses those 
    cliches to surprise the viewers, giving you a left when you are 
    expecting a right and making all the players in this film disposable, 
    even though we get to know them intimately and care about them. 
    Absolutely no one is safe here, which makes this film a refreshing 
    jolt for a slasher film lover as myself. The film opens with two 
    pretty young women, Tara (Jenna Kanell) and Dawn (Catherine 
    Corcoran), leaving a Halloween party and on their way home, but they 
    are too drunk to drive and walk to a pizza parlor to get something to 
    eat and sober up. They don't know that Art the Clown (David Howard 
    Thornton, in a silent performance that will chill you to your core), 
    a serial killer, is following them. As they are sitting in the pizza 
    joint waiting for their slices, Art enters the place and sits by 
    himself at a table (with a black plastic trash bag full of his 
    killing implements) and begins staring at Tara. She is creeped out, 
    but Dawn thinks it is a joke and sits on Art's lap to take a selfie 
    with her phone. The owner of the pizza joint asks Art what he wants 
    to eat (no one pays any attention to his creepy clown get-up because 
    it is Halloween Night), but Art says nothing and gets up and goes to 
    the restroom in the back when the owner tells him if he doesn't order 
    something, he will have to leave the premises. The owner asks Tara if 
    the clown is bothering her and she says yes, he is creeping her out, 
    so he says<A HREF="terrifier_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/terrifier poster16a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="186" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    he will get rid of him. A few moments later, the owner is screaming 
    at Art and throws him out of his joint. We soon find out why (He took 
    a crap and spread his shit all over the restroom!). When Tara and 
    Dawn leave the pizza joint, they discover Dawn's car has a flat tire 
    and she has no spare, so Tara phones her sister, Victoria (Samantha 
    Scaffidi), and begs her to come pick them up. While waiting for 
    Victoria to arrive, Tara has to pee, so she walks over to the nearest 
    building, an apartment complex/warehouse, and asks Mike (Matt 
    McAllister), who is there to exterminate the building of rats, if she 
    can use the bathroom. Mike reluctantly agrees and it is now that the 
    film goes off the rails, but in a good way (What happens to the pizza 
    joint owner is merely the tip of the iceberg when it comes to graphic 
    gore). To say any more would be a disservice to slasher film lovers, 
    but I will tell you this (not telling you the characters these things 
    happen to): You will see such graphic sights as a girl hung upside 
    down and spread-eagle, as she is cut in half with a hacksaw from 
    vagina to head (nothing, and I mean nothing, is left to the 
    imagination!), another young women gets shot in the face multiple 
    times, another woman gets skinned mid-torso-to shoulders, so Art can 
    wear the skin to fool one of his victims (!), someone getting their 
    head stomped on (with very big shoes!) until it is crushed like a 
    grape, the brains spattering on the floor, a manual beheading, 
    someone getting their face chewed off by Art and surviving (!) and 
    other very gory acts, all done expertly and rather realistically. Director/writer
     Damien Leone (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#FrankVsMummy2015">FRANKENSTEIN
     VS. THE MUMMY</A></B> - 2015) made this film, a semi-sequel to his 
    anthology film <B><A HREF="all_hallows_eve_2013.htm">ALL HALLOWS' EVE</A></B> 
    (2013; which is actually a collection of previous shorts Leone made 
    tied together by new wraparound footage), also featuring Art The 
    Clown (but played by a different actor; and it does make a 
    difference!), by crowdfunding it on internet site Indiegogo, turning 
    in a film that is professional on all fronts, be it acting, 
    photography, makeup effects (by Leone, who is a special effects 
    technician by trade) and all other technical departments. I loved 
    this film (the fact that Art doesn't utter a single word throughout 
    the entire film and is still scary beyond belief is a testament to 
    this film's effectiveness) and it is now my favorite slasher film in 
    the past twenty or thirty years. A sequel is coming sometime in 2020 
    (also partially funded by Indiegogo) and to say I am looking forward 
    to watching it is a vast understatement. If you haven't seen this and 
    you love slasher films, what are you waiting for?;<A NAME="Patient62-2016"></A>&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="patient_62_2016.htm">PATIENT 62</A></B> (2016) contains 
    all the elements I usually hate in a low-budget film, including CGI 
    bullet hits, gun muzzle flashes and blood, bad acting and &quot;comic 
    relief&quot;, but damn if I didn't have a good time with this sci-fi 
    actioner. A bartender named Lucas Chance (Reece Wagner) learns from 
    his mother, Anna (April Kasper) that his sister Angela (Anna Seibel) 
    has been missing for several weeks. Angela has gone missing before 
    since she is a drug addict, but his mother tells Lucas that Angela 
    has been &quot;clean&quot; for six months; she went through rehab and 
    kicked her habit. Lucas promises his mother that he will look for his 
    sister. He learns from Angela's former boyfriend, Dennis (Andrew 
    Valdez), that Angela was working as a stripper at a strip club he DJs 
    at, but she then stopped coming in a few weeks ago. Lucas makes 
    Dennis <A HREF="patient_62_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/patient 62 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>take
     him to the strip club, but Dennis will only take him there if Lucas 
    promises to let him DJ a set at the classy bar he works at (Dennis is 
    quite the selfish person, as we will discover later in the film). At 
    the strip club, Lucas runs afoul of club owner Abraham (Brian Dueck), 
    a religious fanatic (!) who orders Rick Ethan (Tyler W. Toppings) and 
    his brother Kelly (Glenn LaPointe; the actor who impressed me the 
    most) to kill Lucas, but first he wants them and his brawny bouncer 
    Herbert (Roman Corkery) to pick up some &quot;methadone&quot; and 
    deliver it to a female scientist, Dr. Carlson (Aubree Erickson), who 
    performs experiments on young women who won't be missed, you know, 
    prostitutes and strippers. Angela is part of her experiments, of 
    which we are not informed what they are...yet. Lucas and Dennis 
    follow the trio to a lab, where Rick kills the chemist and takes 24 
    bottles of &quot;methadone&quot;. Lucas sees this happen and when the 
    trio leave, he checks on the state of the chemist, cutting his hand 
    on a broken bottle of the &quot;methadone&quot; that the chemist had 
    in his lab coat. Of course, this isn't methadone at all, which Lucas 
    will discover very shortly. When Rick, Kelly and Herbert arrive at 
    Dennis's apartment to kill the pair, Lucas does something with his 
    mind that sends Rick flying through the air, killing him, and injures 
    Kelly and Herbert, forcing them to leave (Herbert throws up inside 
    the apartment and outside by what Lucas just did to him). It turns 
    out that this methadone is actually a new drug invented by the dead 
    chemist that turns the people who are injected with it to do amazing 
    things with their mind. Lucas, with the help of Dennis and lesbian 
    friend Twitch (Chrissy Mozylisky), learns how to use his newfound 
    powers (the best part of the film, as it is funny and creative) and 
    he starts having &quot;dreams&quot; where his sister talks to him, 
    which will eventually lead him to Dr. Carlson's laboratory. That's 
    basically the entire film, but it's a fast-paced 80 minutes with a 
    lot to recommend, including a major betrayal, a massacre at the strip 
    club and the brutal death of a family member. While some of the 
    visual effects are cheesy (especially the CGI bullet hits; they never 
    look real), most of them are very well done, especially when Lucas 
    learns how to use and control his powers. This film isn't kid's 
    stuff, as it is an adult tale featuring plenty of nudity and gory 
    violence, especially what happens to Dr. Carlson in the finale. 
    Co-directed by first-timers Bryce Schlamp and Rick Anthony (who also 
    wrote the inventive screenplay) with a lot of verve and imagination. 
    I'd like to see what they can do with a little more money. I'm sure 
    it will be interesting! You can watch this for free on Amazon Prime 
    or, if you are not a Prime member, it can be watched on YouTube on 
    channel &quot;Movie Central&quot;. It's worth seeing no matter where 
    you view it.;<A NAME="BooneBounty2016"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B><A HREF="boone_the_bounty_hunter_2016.htm">BOONE:

    likable actor, it's hard to dislike the film. As a matter of fact, 
    given enough time, Hennigan could be the next B-Movie action hero. 
    Even though this film took nearly five years to complete, due to 
    financial issues (Hennigan, who co-wrote the screenplay and is also 
    Executive producer, sold his dream home and emptied his bank account 
    to finish the film), it doesn't look like it and the action is 
    &quot;stylized&quot;, giving the film a shiny look that will impress 
    most viewers, especially Hennigan's parkour moves, which are quite 
    impressive and done without the use of a stuntman. Hennigan stars as

    The show's Producer, Olivia (Dominique Swain; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#FallDownDead07">FALL
     DOWN DEAD</A></B> - 2007), tells Boone that this fifth season will 
    be their last because of rapidly falling ratings. Boone comes up with 
    an idea to arrest a real criminal and increase the ratings, thereby 
    getting a sixth season, so he phones his old military buddy Cage 
    Bickle (a cameo by Corbin Bernsen; <B><A HREF="psych_tv_series.htm">PSYCH</A></B> 
    [2006 - 2014]) an FBI bigwig who owes Boone a big favor. Boone asks 
    him who is the worst criminal who is now wanted and he says it's Ryan 
    Davenport (Jonathan Lipnicki; <B><A HREF="#CircusKane2017">CIRCUS KANE</A></B> 
    - 2017), the son of drug kingpin Cole Davenport (Richard Tyson; <B><A HREF="#DeathKiss2018">DEATH
     KISS</A></B> - 2018), who is dumping a new cocaine-like drug on the 
    street, which is deadly if you take too much. One of Ryan's hooker 
    dates snorts too much of the drug at a party he is throwing and dies 
    on the spot, so he splits for Mexico. Boone tells his team that they 
    are heading for Mexico to take down a real criminal (Ryan has a ten 
    million dollar bounty on his head, which means they will get one 
    million dollars for his capture). Boone is able to talk Kat and Denny 
    into going with him, but Jackson refuses, saying Mexico has their own 
    laws (Remember Dog and his crew getting arrested in Mexico for 
    breaking their laws?) and he has a wife and kids to think of (He's a 
    rational man!). So Boone, Kat and Denny drive their van to a small 
    town in Mexico and take Ryan prisoner, but Kat and Denny get arrested 
    by the local police (who are on Cole Davenport's payroll) and Boone 
    has to rescue them, but first he locks Ryan in a porta-potty and tips 
    it over (!) in a deserted section of Mexico near the small town. 
    There's a lot that goes on in this film, a lot of it brutal-looking, 
    especially the martial arts fights and Boone's parkour moves, but be 
    aware it's &quot;stylized&quot; violence, so there's hardly any 
    blood, but plenty of deaths. Lots of people are shot and killed, but 
    there's no blood. People are beaten to a pulp, but there's no blood. 
    People fall out of windows, yet they do not bleed when they hit the 
    ground. I know I should hate this film, but John Herrigan's Boone is 
    such a likable character and can fight with the best of them (using 
    wrestling moves, as well as his parkour), it's very hard to dislike 
    this film, because Hennigan has the chops for both brain and brawn 
    and he's funny to boot. When someone says that he just destroyed a 
    ten thousand dollar item, he shoots back with &quot;10 thou? I've got 
    leather pants that cost more than that.&quot; The action never lets 
    up throughout the film and some of the stunts and fights are 
    outstanding (especially by the formidable Cardoza Brothers, played by 
    Lateef Crowder &amp; T.J. Storm, who beat Boone's ass every time they 
    meet), so this is a film any action lover is bound to admire. There 
    are also some very funny scenes, such as the grandmother who asks 
    Boone for an autograph and then opens her blouse so he can sign her 
    breasts! It's also left wide open for a sequel (It turns out Cage 
    Bickle is not quite such a nice guy and wanted Cole Davenport dead 
    for a reason), which I hope is made soon. Filled with cameos, 
    including Lorenzo Lamas (who has a scar on his face that runs from 
    his forehead to his chin!), Tommy 'Tiny&quot; Lister, Erika Eleniak 
    and Del Zamora. Nothing extraordinary, just a solid action flick.;<A NAME="PhantasmRavager2016"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="phantasm_ravager_2016.htm">PHANTASM: RAVAGER</A></B> 
    (2016). After reading god-awful reviews for this film when it had a 
    very limited theatrical/VOD release in 2016, with a disc release 
    shortly thereafter, I held off watching this film for nearly four 
    years, even though I purchased the DVD as soon as it was available. 
    Why? Nearly all readers of this site know that the original <B><A HREF="phantasm_1979.htm">PHAN</A><A HREF="phantasm_1979b.htm">TASM</A></B> 
    (1979) is my favorite horror film of all time and I didn't want to 
    tarnish my memory of it by watching this film, based on every 
    terrible review I read. After viewing it, all I have to say is I 
    don't get all the hate this film received. Sure, it's not directed by 
    Don Coscarelli (he co-wrote and produced this) and it relies a little 
    too much on CGI, but it is a perfectly fine horror film, even though 
    it can't hold a candle to the original (But what can?). It continues 
    the &quot;Tall Man&quot; (Angus Scrimm; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Satanic2005">SATANIC</A></B> 
    - 2005; in his penultimate film) mythos directly after <B><A HREF="phantasm_4_oblivion_1998.htm">PHANTASM
     IV: OBLIVION</A></B> (1998) ended and is basically all about 
    Reggie's (Reggie Bannister; <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm#BloodyBibleCamp2011">BLOODY
     BLOODY BIBLE CAMP</A></B> - 2011) search for his two best friends, 
    Mike (A. Michael Baldwin; <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm#Pickaxe2014">PICKAXE</A></B> 
    - 2014) and his older brother Jody (Bill Thornbury; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#LostEmpire1983">THE
     LOST EMPIRE</A></B> - 1983), as he is stuck in the desert on foot, 
    his 'Cuda stolen when he hid it in the desert. The film also throws a 
    monkey wrench into the proceedings, as Reggie &quot;wakes up&quot; 
    and discovers he has been committed to a hospital because he is in 
    the early stages of dementia, or at least that's what Mike tells him. 
    Is this really happening or is it all a trick by the Tall Man, who is 
    able to travel through alternate dimensions, <A HREF="phantasm_ravager_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/phantasm ravager poster2c small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>to
     stop Reggie from finding Mike and Jody? As the film progresses, we 
    get clues to Reggie's &quot;real&quot; condition, but I'm not going 
    to reveal that here, as &quot;real&quot; in the <B><A HREF="phantasm_2_1988.htm">PHANTASM</A></B> <A HREF="phantasm_3_lord_of_the_dead_1993.htm">universe</A> 
    is not always what it seems. In this film, Reggie gets his 'Cuda back 
    (the thief who stole it is made to strip naked by Reggie, gets killed 
    by a silver sphere and then Reggie runs over him!), meets a pretty 
    woman named Dawn (Dawn Cody), who takes him back to her farm, where 
    she is killed by a sphere and Reggie watches Dawn's Romanian-speaking 
    hired hand Demeter (Daniel Roebuck; <B><A HREF="#T31-2016">31</A></B> 
    - 2016) get drained of blood by another sphere. Reggie continues to 
    &quot;wake&quot; to discover himself in a wheelchair or hospital bed, 
    where the patient next to him is the Tall Man (who delivers a 
    spine-tingling piece of dialogue that will have the hairs on the back 
    of your neck standing up, especially when you realize Mr. Scrimm 
    passed away shortly after making this film). Reggie is then 
    transported to an alternate Earth wracked with disease brought on by 
    the Tall Man, turning our planet into a post-apocalyptic landscape 
    where the uninfected not only have to fight the infected, but also 
    giant big-assed speres that shoot lasers and destroy highrise 
    buildings. Reggie then meets Mike, Jane (also portrayed by Dawn Cody) 
    and diminutive Chunk (Stephen Jutras, who keeps calling Reggie 
    &quot;Baldy&quot;!), all soldiers fighting the Tall Man and his 
    forces. I could go on describing what happens in this film, but it's 
    Unrated for a reason. The minuses are that the spheres are all 
    computer generated and look it. The post-apocalyptic landscape is 
    also obviously computer generated, as are the muzzle flashes of some 
    the weapons. I believe even Angus Scrimm's face got some CGI 
    treatment to fill it out, as his skin looks very waxy, a sure sign of 
    CGI enhancement. The plusses are when the spheres drill into bodies 
    of the living, they are practical effects and the blood is not 
    computer generated (God, I hate CGI blood!). The main plus to this 
    film is Reggie Bannister's acting, which I find lacking in most films 
    he appears in. In this film he gives his all and is quite believable 
    as both the hero and the dementia-suffering patient. He's never been 
    better than he is here. So, if you were afraid of watching this film, 
    directed and co-written by David Hartman (a multiple Emmy Award&reg;-nominated
     animation director; this being his only feature film as a director 
    at the time of this review [May 2020]), I'm here to tell you not to 
    be. This is a perfectly good continuation of the <B><A HREF="phantasm_remastered_2016.htm">PHANTASM</A></B> 
    legacy, supposedly the last chapter in the story (18 years in the 
    making), although it is left wide open for another sequel (During the 
    finale, we see the return of Rocky [Gloria Lynne Henry] from <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Phantasm III">PHANTASM
     III: LORD OF THE DEAD</A></B> [1994], as she and Chunk join Reggie, 
    Mike and Jody for further adventures where it's very cold, since the 
    Tall Man has a major aversion to it). I wouldn't mind another 
    chapter, but it is unlikely, due to Angus Scrimm passing away (he did 
    get to see this film before he went on to the Great Beyond).&nbsp; If 
    you are an Amazon Prime member, the full Unrated version is available 
    free streaming (at the time of this review). The DVD &amp; Blu-Ray 
    has deleted scenes, some of which play during the closing credits, 
    but they are all tinted red. Some of the deleted scenes are really 
    gory and I wonder why they were cut from the film (especially Reggie 
    swinging a sword at the Tall Man's dwarf mutants).;<A NAME="Range15-2016"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="range_15_2016.htm">RANGE 15</A></B> (2016) is another 
    zombie comedy that's vulgar, in complete bad taste, contains too much 
    CGI blood and muzzle flashes and may be too self-aware for its own 
    good, but I still love it anyway. It could be because it is staffed 
    by real-life ex-soldiers, not actors, who do a completely wonderful 
    job in their roles. This film was able to raise over a million 
    dollars on funding site IndieGoGo, which allowed 
    director/producer/co-screenwriter/actor Ross Patterson to hire name 
    actors in cameo roles, but the film is fueled by the non-professional 
    cast. After a<A HREF="range_15_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/range 15 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="164" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    night of hard partying, a group of ex-military soldiers wake up in 
    jail to discover that the country is filled with zombies, thanks to a 
    plane crash that was carrying a top-secret virus. The soldiers, led 
    by Mat Best (Playing a bastardized version of himself. At least I 
    hope it's bastardized!), grab some automatic weapons and head to 
    Range 15, where scientists are trying to find a cure for the zombie 
    plague. Mat and his team have created a special brand of liquor 
    (spiked with viper jizz!) that turns zombies back to their human 
    selves, so they head to Range 15 hoping the scientist can make more. 
    Along the way, Mat and his team run into their old Commanding 
    Officer, Colonel Holloway (Keith David; <B><A HREF="they_live_1988.htm">THEY
     LIVE</A></B> - 1988), who makes Mat give the liquor to national hero 
    Gene Vandenham (director Patterson in a standout hilarious role), a 
    narcissist of the first degree who would rather jog to Range 15 than 
    take an armored military Humvee! As more bottles of the liquor get 
    broken during their travels, Mat and his cohorts must try to take the 
    last remaining bottle to their target or the world in in fucking 
    zombie trouble! Can they do it? Filled with really offensive humor, 
    such as an armless female ex-soldier (played by real-life amputee 
    Mary Dague) having sex with Mat (and then trying to pick up a set of 
    keys with her stumps and failing spectacularly!), zombie children 
    getting their heads blown off, sex with a female zombie at a gas 
    station, one soldier (Jack Mandaville) spending the entire film with 
    a female blow-up sex doll glued to his penis (!) and zombies William 
    Shatner, UFC champ Randy Couture and Danny Trejo (!) trying to bite 
    their asses, nothing is off-limits here (There's a really funny scene 
    where actress Mindy Robinson [<B><A HREF="killjoy_series_2000-2012.htm">KILLJOY
     GOES TO HELL</A></B> - 2012], who plays Eliza, one of two females 
    with the group since the beginning on the film, is shot in the head 
    by one of the solders for simply saying the wrong thing at the wrong 
    time!). While some of the humor doesn't work, a lot of it does and if 
    you don't laugh loudly, then you, my friend, don't have a sense of 
    humor. Nearly all of the non-actors register in their roles and have 
    very good timing (There's a reason why Mat is the leader. He's very 
    funny!) and the film moves at a very brisk pace. Besides the cameos 
    already mentioned, there's Sean Astin (<B><A HREF="#DeadAnt2017">DEAD ANT</A></B>

    kitchen sink comedies, where nothing is considered taboo, you are 
    bound to enjoy this extremely bloody (even though a lot of the blood 
    is CGI created) and ultra-violent film. Available streaming on Amazon

     Readers of this site know I'm not a fan of anthology films, 
    especially horror anthologies, as the wrap-around footage to all the 
    unrelated short films is tenuous at best. But I am making an 
    exception with <B><A HREF="patient_seven_2016.htm">PATIENT SEVEN</A></B> 
    (2016), a slam-bang anthology film where the wrap-around footage is 
    the best I have seen in a long, long time. And that is due primarily 
    to Michael Ironside, who delivers a performance so forceful and 
    memorable, I think it is one of his greatest acting achievements. It 
    also looks like he is having a ball doing it. The story is rather 
    simple: Dr. Daniel Marcus (Michael Ironside; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Visiting Hours">VISITING
     HOURS</A></B> - 1981) comes to the U.S.-based Spring Valley Mental 
    Hospital to interview six extremely unusual mental patients for a 
    book he is writing (he's a best-selling author on books pertaining to 
    mental <A HREF="patient_seven_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/patient seven poster10a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="215" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>illness).
     Most of these patients are very dangerous, but they are all hiding 
    secrets Dr. Marcus hopes to uncover and he does it in a way that 
    makes the patients very angry. Basically, he calls them out as fakes, 
    calling them such names as &quot;pathetic killers&quot;, 
    &quot;liars&quot; or &quot;phonies&quot;, saying all of them are 
    pitiful excuses for human beings. He sees the patients one-by-one, 
    and we then see six short films pertaining to their crimes. Most of 
    these short films were made long before the wrap-around footage with 
    Ironside was shot (One short film dates back to 2011), but it is 
    exceptional the way wrap-around director Danny Draven (a member of 
    the Charles Band filmmaking school, directing such lowgrade, 
    low-budget horror films as <B><A HREF="horrorvision_2000.htm">HORRORVISION</A></B> 
    [2000], <B><A HREF="cryptz_2002.htm">CRYPTZ</A></B> [2002] and <B><A HREF="deathbed_2002.htm">DEATHBED</A></B> 
    - 2002), makes all the short films work for the film, even though 
    most of the patients never appear in them! We get short films on 
    demons (one butt-ugly demon played by Doug Jones [<B><A HREF="shape_of_water_2017.htm">THE
     </A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="shape_of_water_2017.htm">SHAPE</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B><A HREF="shape_of_water_2017.htm">

    here, titled <B><A HREF="patient_seven_2016.htm#BodyShortFilm2013">THE
     BODY</A></B> [2013], directed by Paul Davis and starring Alfie Allen [<B><A HREF="game_of_thrones_tv_series_2011.htm">THE
     GAME OF THRONES</A></B>]), zombies, vampires and other creatures 
    that go bump in the night. After Dr. Marcus gets done interviewing 
    the six patients, he goes to leave the mental institution, where we 
    meet Patient #7 (and get a seventh short film). And it's a corker 
    (Pay close attention to the conversation Dr. Marcus has with mental 
    institution psychiatrist Dr. Paul Victor [Jack Plotnick] in the 
    beginning of the film for clues to who Patient #7 is)! The acting in 
    this film is uniformly very good, especially Ironside and Patient #2, 
    &quot;John Doe&quot; (Daniel Lench), who hates plastic wrap for 
    reasons that is explained in director Paul Davis' Halloween-themed 
    short film. So what does Dr. Marcus do? That's right, he takes a roll 
    of plastic wrap and wraps it around John Doe's body until he tells 
    him the truth. This is the way he treats all the patients. No kid 
    gloves here, just brutal therapy that no licensed psychiatrist would 
    ever perform. I must also say that the short films here are also very 
    good, one directed by Erlingur Thoroddsen (who later gave us <B><A HREF="#ChildEater2015">CHILD
     EATER</A></B> - 2015) in Icelandic and subtitled in English. This is 
    a modern anthology done right and even diehard anthology haters are 
    bound to love this, if only for Michael Ironside's outstanding 
    performance. Available streaming on Amazon Prime and now available 
    streaming free on YouTube, courtesy of channel &quot;Kings Of Horror&quot;.</FONT></FONT></P>

     DTV Genre Films Part 20b (continued):;<A NAME="Bloodrunners2016"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     I went into <B><A HREF="bloodrunners_2016.htm">BLOODRUNNERS</A></B> 
    (2016) with a lot of trepidation (after all, Ice-T is given top 
    billing), but after a very short time, I found myself enjoying this 
    film, even though some of the acting is amateurish and its low-budget 
    shines through in some scenes. It's 1933 in the fictional town of 
    South Hampton, New Jersey (actually filmed in Pennsylvania) and 
    Prohibition is in full swing. The entire police force in town are 
    corrupt and this film mainly concentrates on Officer Jack Malone (a 
    good Michael McFadden, who also co-wrote the story and screenplay, as 
    well as an Associate Producer here), who shakes down all the 
    speakeasys, bootleggers and other criminals in town, making them pay 
    a weekly &quot;luxury tax&quot; and splits the money evenly with all 
    the other cops in town, including his commanding officer, Chief Baker 
    (Danny Doherty). A new speakeasy opens in town, called 
    &quot;Chesterfield's&quot; and Jack has been checking it out 
    undercover for about a week. Jack's partner, Sam (Dan McGlaughlin), 
    joins him at Chesterfield's on this day, as we watch band leader, 
    trumpet player and Master of Ceremonies Chester (Ice-T) performing on 
    stage, as Jack sees a person being forcibly escorted to a back room 
    against his will to meet speakeasy owner Victor Renfield (Peter 
    Patrikios). The obviously gay Victor has the man tied to a chair and 
    Chester, who is the real speakeasy owner, as well as being a vampire 
    who is over 130 years old (Victor is his non-vampire 
    &quot;familiar&quot;, as you can tell by his last name), begins 
    cutting off the man's fingers with tin snips and putting them in his 
    mouth, sucking out all the blood (He also has a collection of human 
    fingers he keeps in a box)! Jack doesn't know that he is dealing with 
    vampires and he and Sam shake down the speakeasy, where Victor and 
    Chester gladly pay the luxury tax. Thinking it was way too easy, Jack 
    shakes down handyman Willie (Chris James Boylan), who works at the 
    speakeasy and also works at a whorehouse run by Rosie (Kerry McGann) 
    and is in love with Rosie's virginal daughter Anna (Airen DeLaMater) 
    and wants to marry her as soon as he makes enough money to give her a 
    life she deserves. Jack is able to squeeze some information out of 
    the unwilling Willie that makes him believe that Chesterfield's is 
    not only serving illegal alcohol, but also that they&nbsp; are 
    running it across borders, too, so he, Sam and two other cops stake 
    out the only road out of town to catch them in the act, in order to 
    squeeze more money out of them. While Jack acts as a sniper a short 
    distance away (he was a sniper on the Front during WWI),<A HREF="bloodrunners_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/bloodrunners 2016 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    Sam and the other two cops form a roadblock waiting for 
    Chesterfield's truck to try and pass them. When the truck arrives, a 
    man called Morton (John Groody) steps out the passenger side of the 
    truck. This causes Jack to have a major flashback to the war, where 
    he spots a medic on the German side of the Front feasting on the 
    bodies of injured German soldiers, forcing Jack to shoot the medic in 
    the head, which causes retaliation from the German side and all of 
    Jack's comrades are killed by the relentless shelling and machinegun 
    fire, leaving Jack as the only survivor. Jack has this flashback 
    because Morton is the spitting image of the German medic he shot in 
    the head! When a man tries to slink his way out of the back of the 
    truck unnoticed, Jack shoots and kills him, forcing Sam and the other 
    two cops to shoot and kill Luther and the driver, Davis (Jared 
    Malcolm). Sam and the two cops then discover that there is no booze 
    in the bottles they are running, it is actually human blood! It turns 
    out that none of them are dead, as Luther, Davis and the third person 
    bare their fangs and kill Sam and the other two cops, while Jack 
    helplessly watches. He runs to go help his friends but he smacks his 
    head on a tree branch in the pitch darkness and knocks himself out 
    cold. Rosie finds him and drives an unconscious Jack to her 
    whorehouse, where he recuperates from his wounds, before heading home 
    a couple of days later. We then learn that Jack was once in a serious 
    relationship with Rosie, but he came back a changed man from the war 
    (before PTSD was even a medical condition), causing them to break up. 
    Rosie has one other bit of information to drop on Jack, but that will 
    come later. The vampires then begin turning the prostitutes in Rosie 
    whorehouse into vampires, beginning with Violet (Tammy Jean), in 
    order to take over this town. They manage to get rid of all the cops 
    on the force except for Jack, who is forced to team with Willie and a 
    psychotic preacher, Luther (Jack Hoffman) to get rid of the vampires 
    in his town and also to rescue Anna, who has been kidnapped by 
    Chester because her virgin blood is highly sought after by his 
    vampire clients. Will they be successful? While this film has some 
    terrible CGI (especially some of the muzzle flashes and bullet hits), 
    this is still a very enjoyable low-budget effort (made for less than 
    $500,000). Director/producer/co-writer/cinematographer/Production 
    Designer Dan Lantz, who also made the god-awful <A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#BloodlustZombies11"><B>BLOODLUST
     ZOMBIES</B></A> (2011), seems to have learned from his mistakes, 
    using cars, clothing and locations from the early-1930's to make this 
    film seem fairly genuine (I also noticed that he didn't use any long 
    shots here, as it would be impossible to not film modern-day 
    automobiles on the streets, as this film couldn't afford location 
    shooting permits). There is also some extremely funny dialogue here, 
    especially what Preacher Luther says just before he dies and the 
    insults the Chief and Jack use against Victor and the vampires. While 
    the &quot;N-word&quot; is used here, it is only said by Ice-T and the 
    racism is kept to the minimum, or as Sam says to Jack, &quot;This is 
    1933, coloreds and white people talk to each other now without it 
    turning violent!&quot; While Ice-T only worked on this film for one 
    day (being flown by helicopter from the set of <B><A HREF="law_and_order_special_victims_unit_tv_series.htm">LAW
     &amp; ORDER: SVU</A></B> to film his scenes), he manages to turn in 
    a pretty good performance as Chester and is mainly seen during the 
    beginning and ending of the film, leaving it wide open for a sequel. 
    There is also quite a bit of female nudity here and while the film is 
    somewhat bloody, it is hampered by some poor CGI, but I am able to 
    forgive the film for that since it moves at a brisk pace and manages 
    to entertain thoroughly. Try it, you may just like it!;<A NAME="SurvivalGame2016"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Now I don't know the first thing about Russian genre films (I've 
    only seen a couple), but if they are as entertaining as <B><A HREF="survival_game_2016.htm">SURVIVAL
     GAME</A></B> (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="survival_game_2016.htm#MafiaSurvivalGame">MAFIA:
     SURVIVAL GAME</A></B> - 2016), then I need to see more. Based on the 
    popular Mafia franchise of video games (I never played it, so I don't 
    know how faithful the movie is to the game), this sci-fi/horror flick 
    is set in Moscow in the year 2072, where the popular worldwide 
    reality TV series &quot;Mafia Game&quot; is in its 75th season. The 
    game, where <A HREF="survival_game_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("149","212") --><IMG SRC="images/mafia survival game france dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>people
     actually die on screen, is waning in popularity (Death on TV is no 
    longer a rare event and the audience is growing tired of it), so the 
    Gamemaster/Game Creator (Viktor Verzhbitskiy) decides to throw a 
    couple of monkey wrenches into the mix, by adding two prison convicts 
    and a psychic named Constantine (Yuriy Chursin) as contestants in the 
    game (and also a surprise revealed at the end of the game). The rules 
    are pretty simple: Twelve players each have their own pods to sit in 
    (in a semi-circle) and two of the players are Mafia and the other ten 
    are Civilians.&nbsp; No one knows who the Mafia members are (they are 
    tattooed on the wrist when the game begins, two of them being branded 
    Mafia, the rest Civilians, but no one can see anyone else's tattoo), 
    so they are given a certain amount of time (which is reduced in each 
    round) to vote on the person they believe is Mafia. Even if they are 
    wrong, the person who gets the majority of the votes on being the 
    Mafia member is trapped their pod as it travels up into the game's 
    nexus (shaped like a planet on fire), where they die based on their 
    worst fears. The last person left in the game gets one million 
    dollars. We are then given small introductions to the players and why 
    they chose to participate in this deadly game. There's a ballerina 
    named Maria (Natalya Rudova) who got into a car accident and 
    destroyed the nerves in her legs. She became a game member because an 
    operation to restore her legs cost more than she can afford and if 
    she wins the game, she will use the prize money to have her legs 
    repaired and become a ballerina again. Her stalker, Vanya (Artyom 
    Suchkov), is also a game member (these are not the only two members 
    who know each other). Unfortunately, she is the first one the 
    majority of the players vote on as being a Mafia member and it's 
    revealed that she's actually a Citizen (Vanya begs the group to take 
    him instead, but the rules to the game cannot be broken), yet she 
    makes the trip to the nexus and dies from her worst fear (which I 
    will leave you to discover). One of the convicts, Krivoy (Aleksey 
    Grishin), is a violent thug convicted of multiple murders (He has a 
    huge scar on his face) and the next round of voting make him the next 
    one to die. When it is revealed that he is also a Citizen, we watch 
    him ride to the nexus and face his fear, where he is attacked by 
    multiple muscled brutes, but Krivoy manages to beat them all and goes 
    to walk away, only to trip and impale his head on a piece of rebar 
    sticking out of the floor. There is no way in this game to cheat your 
    death and this is a prime example of it. When &quot;nighttime&quot; 
    falls, the two unknown Mafia members get to vote a civilian out of 
    the game and they also die from their worst fears. Psychic 
    Constantine tells everyone he knows how the game will end but he 
    refuses to tell anyone how it will. As more people get voted off, all 
    of them Civilians, there are only seven members left. When the vote 
    to get Constantine out of the game is tied 3-3, Constantine votes 
    himself out of the game and reveals he is actually one of the Mafia 
    members. So who is the other member? Is it the 85-year-old Luka 
    (Venyamin Smekhov), a degenerate gambler (who always seems to win) 
    who looks much younger than he is due to youth treatments? Or is it 
    the other convict, 18-year-old Vladimir (Vyacheslav Razbegaev, and 
    thank God for cut-and-paste!), who is actually innocent of the crime 
    he was convicted of and one of the surviving members of the game 
    knows it, as she falsely testified against him in court? What about 
    Ilya (Andrey Chadov), who laughs<A HREF="survival_game_2016.htm"><IMG SRC="images/mafia survival game amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    at everything, yet he is dying of pancreatic cancer (even in 2072, 
    there's still no cure for it)? How about Katya (Violetta Getmanskaya) 
    and Kirill (Vadim Tsallati) who met and fell in love the day before 
    they joined the game? I'm not going to tell you how it ends because 
    that would deprive you of a real surprise. This film is 90% CGI, but 
    it is excellent CGI, better than the superhero blockbusters that come 
    from the United States, so it doesn't interfere with your enjoyment. 
    If you think the plot of this reality game is something that will 
    never happen, all I have to say is &quot;Really?&quot; We've been 
    heading in that direction for a long time, as <A HREF="odds_n_ends.htm#RealityTVSuicides">contestants
     on TV reality shows commit suicide</A> all the time when their 
    fifteen minutes of fame are up. How hard would it be to get twelve 
    people to risk their lives for one million dollars? The film is also 
    stunt heavy, especially when ex-military member Vanya (Artyom 
    Suchkov), who lost his entire platoon due to a terrible mistake he 
    made, must face his worst fear; the massacre of his platoon. This 
    sequence is full of terrific stunts, explosions and bloody bullet 
    squibs. Director/producer Sarik Andreasyan (<B><A HREF="guardians_2017.htm">THE
     GUARDIANS</A></B> - 2017) shows a sure hand with the material 
    (screenplay by Andrey Gavrilov) and always keeps you guessing, making 
    this a good choice for those who like unusual sci-fi stories mixed 
    with a little bit of horror (I didn't even mention the kaiju giant 
    monster in one of the contestant's fears or another player getting 
    devoured by several sharks!). Even the English dubbing is better than 
    usual and doesn't distract you from the movie. Available to watch for 
    free streaming on Tubi and on YouTube from channel &quot;V 
    Movies&quot;, who has the habit of giving the films he streams false 
    titles, labeling this one as &quot;2070 - Final Game&quot;, even 
    though the print bears the review title. This has been becoming a 
    regular practice on YouTube and for the life of me, I don't know why. 
    It's not like they are illegally streaming the films, because they 
    are not, so why give the film a fake title? Stupidity, plain and 
    simple. If there is a reasonable explanation, I would love to hear it.</FONT></FONT></P>

    (2017). Even though it was Executive Produced by Stan Lee, there is

    monoxide poisoning due to a defective garage door, but Dr. Valentine 
    is at the scene, too. A woman from CPS comes to Claire's house and 
    wants to take custody of Madison away from Claire, but she says no. 
    The CPS lady says she will return with law enforcement to make sure 
    she can take charge of her, but notices that Claire and Wyatt are 
    walking into the garage, so she illegally enters the house and goes 
    to Madison's bedroom. She doesn't want to go with her, so she makes 
    the Sandman appear and Claire and Wyatt hear the CPS lady's screams. 
    They both soon become believers when they see the Sandman turn the 
    lady to dust. Both Claire and Wyatt take different steps to resolve 
    the problem. Wyatt tries to kill Madison, but soon feels the 
    Sandman's deadly wrath, while Claire contacts a hypnotherapist, Dr. 
    Amanda Elliott (Amanda Wyss; <B><A HREF="nightmare_on_elm_street_1984.htm">A
     NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET</A></B> - 1984) who says she can cure 
    Madison. She hypnotises Madison and tells her to bring the Sandman to 
    life and to grab and hold him. She does that and the Sandman seems to 
    disappear. Seems to. Dr. Elliott gets ta cough and takes a drink of 
    water. She drops the glass and nothing but sand falls out of it. The 
    Doctor falls back on the chair and the Sandman bursts from her 
    stomach, so Claire and Madison run away. Madison is captured&nbsp; by 
    Dr. Valentine and put in a high tech windowed cell that is impossible 
    to escape from. Unless you are the Sandman. The creature breaks open 
    the door to the cell and kills all of Dr. Valentine's high-tech 
    solders, when Dr Valentine's boss says he is not interested in 
    advancing any further with Madison and try to kill her with poison 
    gas. (The Sandman squeezes one guy in a poison gas protection suit on 
    his head until it is nothing but a bloody pulp. Dr. Valentine tells 
    Claire and Madison to take his car and get the hell out of there 
    before he dies (although we never see him die) and that is just what 
    they do. It seems that Madison has telekenitic powers, too, as she 
    can move objects just by waving her arms, as the Sandman chases them 
    into a warehouse. Madison tries to stop him by using her powers to 
    drop the ceiling on him, but he just pops-up and continues the chase.

     the Sandman and he burns to death, this time for good. This film is

    - 2015) keeps the film moving at a fast clip and for once, the 
    Sandman is not a CGI creation, but an actual man (Mick Ignis) in a 
    monster suit and it is pretty effective. What CGI this film does have 
    is much better than SyFy standards and there is plenty of blood and 
    unusual deaths to go around for 5 films. I usually don't say this, 
    but SyFy has finally released a winner!;<A NAME="End?2017"></A> <B><A HREF="end_2017.htm">THE
     END?</A></B> (2017) is an Italian zombie film with a difference, as 
    it doesn't adhere to standard zombie conventions. It is basically a 
    one person film, capably handled by Alessandro Roja as Claudio 
    Verona, a businessman who is quite unlikable at the beginning, 
    ignoring his chauffeur's questions and trying to continue an affair 
    with a fellow businesswoman on an elevator. But things suddenly 
    change as soon as that woman exits the elevator. Claudio finds 
    himself trapped in the elevator between the sixth and seventh floors 
    as something quite deadly happens all around him. People are turning 
    into flesh-eating zombie-like creatures (the fast-moving kind) and 
    all of Rome is affected. Director/co-screenwriter Daniele Misischia 
    only gives us hints of what is happening by way of phone calls and 
    internet sites on Claudio's cell phone, as Claudio tries to get out 
    of the elevator. He is only able to open the doors of the elevator 
    about eight inches, not enough for him to get out or anybody to get 
    in, but enough for him to get an idea what is going on, as he sees 
    his fellow employees turning into flesh-eating creatures and killing 
    other fellow employees. Daniele Misischia and, especially, Alessandro 
    Roja turns Claudio into a person we begin to care about, as he 
    befriends a policeman named Marcello (Claudio Camilli), who helps him 
    understand what is going on and brings out the human side of Claudio. 
    Filled with bloody deaths, but surprisingly sparse gore, this film is 
    remarkable for the way it holds your attention since the main set is 
    the confines of a small elevator. It also doesn't end the way you 
    would expect it would. I wholeheartedly recommend you watch this 
    film. And I thought Italian horror was dead! I would like to see what 
    Daniele Misischia does next.;<A NAME="Trench11-2017"></A> <B><A HREF="trench_11_2017.htm">TRENCH
     11</A></B> (2017) is a dandy horror film with much to recommend, as 
    long as you are not claustrophobic. This may sound like a &quot;Nazi 
    scientist creates something sinister&quot; type of film, but it is 
    different enough to recommend. During the end of World War One, a 
    British Intelligence Unit discovers a series of underground tunnels 
    that go miles under the ground, all made by the Germans close to the 
    Front Line. A strict Maj. Jennings (Ted Atherton)&nbsp; has no other 
    choice but to use American soldiers as protection (his distaste for 
    Americans is quite obvious) and a shellshocked Canadian 
    &quot;tunneler&quot; and demolitions expert named Lt. Berton (Rossif 
    Sutherland), who just survived twelve days underground in a tunnel 
    cave-in, as a guide to collect any information they can find in the 
    tunnels, which is believed to be a<A HREF="trench_11_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/trench 11 dvd front2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    laboratory for an evil German scientist named Reiner (Robert 
    Stadlober), who is known as &quot;The Prophet&quot;. As they make 
    their way into the tunnels, they discover that they are not alone, as 
    there are some disfigured German soldiers there, who seem to be on 
    one mission, to kill everyone they come in contact with. The Germans 
    have also sent a squad of soldiers, led by Kapitan M&uuml;ller (Shaun 
    Benson), to accompany Reiner back to the tunnels to blow up the 
    laboratory and everything inside it, something they tried to do 
    before they retreated, but somehow it failed. Long story short, 
    nearly everyone is killed, some by the mutated soldiers, who have 
    worm-like parasites inside their bodies and brains, which turns them 
    violent, and some by Reiner himself, who we find out returned there 
    to continue his experiments (Even the German military is scared of 
    him). The only ones left alive are Reiner, Kapitan M&uuml;ller and 
    Lt. Berton. M&uuml;ller and Berton join forces to blow-up the tunnel 
    system, because even M&uuml;ller is tired of Reiner's methods. While 
    this all sounds pat, I am here to tell you it is anything but, as 
    there is plenty of graphic violence (one scared German soldier begs 
    an American soldier to shoot him in the head, which he does!), cringe-worthy
     practical effects (the worm parasites are appropriately disgusting) 
    and tense situations. Director/co-screenwriter Leo Scherman has a 
    definite grasp of the material and the tunnels come across as 
    extremely tight (hence the claustrophobic comment). The film moves at 
    a quick pace and doesn't give you time to think about some of the 
    plot holes. Both Robert Stadlober and Rossif Sutherland (who reminded 
    me of Vincent D'Onofrio in his acting and mannerisms) turn in good 
    performances and Ted Atherton is bound to get on your nerves as Maj. 
    Jennings, but he is supposed to, as he has a single mindset to 
    complete his mission, no matter how many lives are lost. This 
    Canadian flick hits all the right notes and should be a cult item in 
    the years to come (I finally am in sync with a blurb on the DVD 
    sleeve, which says, &quot;A Future Cult Classic!&quot;). See for 
    yourself. Available streaming on Amazon Prime or you can buy the DVD 
    on Amazon from Image Entertainment. This actually got a limited 
    theatrical run in Canada.; <B><A HREF="brawl_in_cell_block_99_2017.htm">BRAWL
     IN CELL BLOCK 99</A></B><A NAME="BrawlCell99-2017"></A> (2017) is 
    one of the most brutal films I have ever seen and I guarantee you 
    will never look at Vince Vaughn the same way again. Vaughn (<B><A HREF="term_life_2016.htm">TERM
     LIFE</A></B> - 2016) stars as Bradley Thomas (Do not call him 
    &quot;Brad&quot;, he doesn't like it!) and he is about to have a very 
    bad day. He loses his job at a garage and also discovers that his 
    wife, Lauren (Jennifer Carpenter; <B><A HREF="dexter_tv_series.htm">DEXTER</A></B> 
    - 2006-2013) is cheating on him. After tearing Lauren's car apart 
    with his bare hands (Vaughn put fifteen pounds of muscle on his frame 
    and took boxing lessons before appearing in this film), he sits down 
    with Lauren to discuss their marriage, which we learn hasn't been 
    good ever since Lauren had a miscarriage and lost their baby. They 
    decide to give their marriage another chance and Bradley takes a 
    &quot;temporary&quot; job with his friend Gil (Marc Blucas; <B><A HREF="thr3e_2006.htm">THR3E</A></B> 
    - 2006) to deliver drugs for him. Eighteen months pass and we see 
    that Lauren is pregnant and her marriage to Bradley is going 
    swimmingly, yet he is still working for Gil delivering and picking up 
    drugs. As a matter of fact, Bradley is Gil's number one guy, so he 
    asks Bradley to help him on a &quot;big&quot; deal. It seems Gil is 
    going into business with a South American drug lord named Eleazar 
    (Dion Mucciacito) and he wants Gil to help pick up a huge <A HREF="brawl_in_cell_block_99_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/brawl in cell block 99 amazon poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>shipment
     of heroin, but there is one caveat: Eleazar brought along two 
    lackeys, whom he insists go along with Gil to pick up the drugs. One 
    of the lackeys, the hulking Roman (Geno Segers), is using, so Bradley 
    doesn't trust him and refuses to pick up the drugs. Gil convinces him 
    to go (he gives Bradley three months off when Lauren has the baby), 
    but Bradley makes one thing clear to everyone: He is the boss on this 
    pickup, no questions asked. As you can guess, something goes very 
    wrong on the pickup, as the two lackeys get into a shootout with the 
    police. Bradley has no choice but to kill the lackeys (well, at least 
    one of them) when they start killing cops. Bradley is arrested and he 
    tells Detective Watkins (Clark Johnson; TV's <B><A HREF="homicide_life_on_the_streets_tv_series_1993-1999.htm">HOMICIDE:
     LIFE ON THE STREETS</A></B> - 1993-1999; in a cameo) that he knows 
    what he did was wrong, but he is not going to give him any names, he 
    will plead guilty and do his time (Bradley is a straight-up guy). 
    After telling Lauren not to come to prison to visit him and 
    especially not when their baby is born (They know it is going to be a 
    girl and Bradley doesn't want her to see him in prison, as it will 
    not make a good first impression), Bradley is sentenced to seven 
    years at a medium-security prison, but he will not stay there very 
    long, While he is there, he gets a visit from the &quot;Placid 
    Man&quot; (a terrific Udo Kier; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#MarkOfTheDevil1970">MARK
     OF THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1970), who tells Bradley that he works for 
    Eleazar and they have kidnapped Lauren (he shows him a picture of a 
    tied-up Lauren on his phone). He also tells Bradley that the failed 
    drug deal cost Eleazar $3,500,000 and if he doesn't pay it back, a 
    Korean doctor, who is proficient at cutting off an unborn baby's 
    limbs and still have it live, will do it to his baby unless he finds 
    a way to get transferred to Redleaf Maximum Security Prison and kills 
    an inmate called &quot;Christopher Knight&quot;, who is in Cell Block 
    99. If he kills this man, his debt will be clear and Lauren will be 
    released unharmed. Now I'm not going to tell you how he gets himself 
    transferred, but I will say that it is as brutal and violent as you 
    will ever witness in a film and it only gets worse as the film 
    progresses, culminating in a very gory and unbelievably violent 
    conclusion, the likes of which will leave your jaw scraping the 
    floor. This is grim, brutal stuff (&quot;Brutal&quot; is the only 
    word I can come up with to properly describe this film), as 
    director/screenwriter S. Craig Zahler (<B><A HREF="bone_tomahawk_2015.htm">BONE
     TOMAHAWK</A></B> - 2015; another extremely violent film which I have 
    yet to <A HREF="#BoneTomahawk2015">review</A>, but I will shortly) 
    fills the screen with gory violence and really tense situations. What 
    I found remarkable here, besides Vince Vaughn's excellent 
    performance, is Redleaf's Warden Tuggs is played by a nearly 
    unrecognizable Don Johnson, who turns in an exceptional performance 
    as a man who takes no bullshit from anyone, telling Bradley not to 
    think of this as a maximum security prison, but rather as 
    &quot;minimal freedom&quot; prison. And he couldn't be more correct, 
    as Bradley is fitted with a shock belt that delivers jolt after jolt 
    of electricity to his body as punishment for breaking some prisoners' 
    and guards' bones. It turns out Christopher Knight doesn't exist and 
    it was merely an excuse to get Bradley in this prison, where a 
    convicted Eleazar and Roman want him dead. The finale will make you 
    hit the rewind button several times to make sure you saw what you 
    just saw. This may be the best film that never got a theatrical 
    release in the United States (well, it got a limited theatrical 
    release while being released directly to VOD). It is 132 minutes of 
    pure hell (Vaughn has a shaved head with a huge crucifix tattooed on 
    the back of his cranium, making him look like a skinhead, but that 
    couldn't be further from the truth, as he is a fair man that is just 
    pushed too far.) and the fight scenes are very realistic, Vaughn 
    doing all of his own stunts and doing them with panache. I doubt you 
    will see a film this violent for years to come, so I recommend you 
    become an Amazon Prime member or buy the Blu-Ray. This is a film you 
    will want to see if ultraviolent, extremely gory scenes don't bother 
    you (especially Eleazar's death!). I think I found a new film to put 
    on my Top 20 List! S. Craig Zahler's next film was <B><A HREF="dragged_across_concrete_2018.htm">DRAGGED
     ACROSS CONCRETE</A></B> (2018; it is an appropriate description on 
    how one of Eleazar's goons gets killed in prison!), starring many of 
    the same actors in this film. Look for a review soon.;<A NAME="Unwilling2017"></A> 
    I liked <B><A HREF="unwilling_2017.htm">THE UNWILLING</A></B> (2017) 
    a little more than most people due to the characters, which are more 
    true-to-life than most modern horror films. That's not to say the 
    film doesn't have its share of problems, but, for me, the positives 
    outweigh the negatives. When the elderly Mr. Harris (Lance Henriksen; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#HarbingerDown15">HARBINGER
     DOWN</A></B> - 2015) lies dying in his hospital bed, a mysterious 
    man, claiming to be Mr. Harris' lawyer (Charles Gorgano), delivers a 
    strange-looking black box to his hospital room and then disappears. 
    Mr. Harris suddenly wakes up, touches the box and then touches his 
    nurse (Levy Tran), turning her into a possessed demon, who then kills 
    herself (by slicing her own throat). Mr. Harris then dies. We are 
    then introduced to Mr. Harris' relatives, as they travel to the house 
    of his OCD-riddled son David (an excellent David Lipper; <B><A HREF="lost_after_dark_2014.htm">LOST
     AFTER DARK</A></B> - 2014), who must do everything three times 
    before he is satisfied. Besides David, there's daughter Michelle 
    (Dina Meyer; <B><A HREF="evil_within_2016.htm">THE EVIL WITHIN</A></B> 
    - 2016), who's is obsessed with looking beautiful as she grows older 
    (letting us see how limber she is by performing an eye-opening yoga 
    scene); good girl niece Kelly Davis (Austin Highsmith) and drug 
    addict nephew Darren Davis (Jake Thomas; <B><A HREF="cell_2000.htm">THE
     CELL</A></B> - 2000), who just missed<A HREF="unwilling_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/unwilling amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="164" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    scoring with his dealer and will soon go through withdrawal. Also at 
    the reading of the will is Michelle's ex-husband Rich Lamplin (Robert 
    Rusler; <B><A HREF="sometimes_they_come_back_1991.htm">SOMETIMES THEY 
    COME BACK</A></B> - 1991), a money-hungry financier who made Mr. 
    Harris a lot of money, who brings along his very young fiancee Cheryl 
    Cates (Bree Williamson), just to make Michelle jealous. As they all 
    arrive at David's house, the doorbell rings and when David opens the 
    door (three times), no one is there, just a package sitting there. 
    When the package is opened, they all discover the strange black box 
    inside, but there are no seams or obvious ways of opening it. When 
    Darren tries to open it, six needles suddenly protrude from the top 
    of the box, Darren pricking his finger. Now this is the part I find 
    hard to believe. Rich says the six needles represent the six of them 
    at the reading of the will, so he talks everyone into pricking their 
    finger on one of the needles (like some DNA test!), hoping the the 
    box will open, which they all do! When they do, a drawer in the box 
    opens, revealing a solid bar of gold. Rich picks it up and is 
    extremely excited, saying the bar of gold could be worth millions, 
    but the bar suddenly turns very hot, burning Rich's hand, forcing him 
    to drop it. It is obvious the Rich is now possessed by some unseen 
    demon(s), as he begins acting strange, trying to rape Michelle as she 
    is taking a shower, forcing her to stab him in the neck with 
    scissors, killing him. It turns out the box gives you not only what 
    you want, but what you need, but it comes with deadly consequences. 
    Michelle is the next to suffer (a small opening in the box reveals a 
    mirror), as the bar of gold dissolves, possessing the wall mirror 
    above it to give Michelle a good look at her younger self. When 
    Michelle gets too close to the mirror, something pulls her inside it, 
    trapping her forever in the demon's world. The box then gives Darren 
    some of his favorite drug of choice, so he steals Michelle's car and 
    tries to drive away, but he always ends up at David's house, no 
    matter what direction he travels in. Since David has a severe case of 
    OCD and is agoraphobic (he hasn't stepped out of his house in over 
    ten years), the demons have a very hard time tempting him, trying to 
    get him to step outside with no success. Will they succeed? You'll 
    have to watch the film to find out. Capably directed by Jonathan Heap (<B><A HREF="greenmail_2001.htm">GREENMAIL</A></B> 
    - 2001), with just the right amount of humor mixed in with some 
    extreme bloodletting. Lance Henriksen's role is nothing but a 
    glorified cameo, making an appearance in the beginning and the end of 
    the film to give David some important information about the box and 
    how to defeat it. This is not a great film by any means, but it is an 
    enjoyable one for those who like their horror films with a little 
    meat on its bones. You can see it for free on Amazon Prime if you are 
    a Prime member. Originally released in 2016 to some film festivals, 
    the film was reworked somewhat after that and now carries a 2017 
    production date during the end credits.;<A NAME="MomAndDad2017"></A>

    could pull off, as it is remarkable from beginning to end. It will 
    make you howl with laughter, cringe in fright and play with all of 
    your emotions for 90 minutes non-stop. The film concentrates on one 
    family: father Brent (Cage), mother Kendall (Selma Blair; <B><A HREF="hellboy_2004.htm">HELLBOY</A></B> 
    - 2004), rambunctous &amp; rebellious teenage daughter Carly (Anne 
    Winters) and inquisitive young son Josh (Zackary Arthur). Both Brent 
    and Kendall are going through their own mid-life crisis and it is 
    obvious that their marriage is on the rocks. Over breakfast, Carly 
    says she wants to spend the night with her friends, but Kendall says 
    no, Brent's parents are coming over for dinner tonight and it would 
    be nice if they see their granddaughter. Brent says he knows what 
    Carly really wants to do tonight, spend the evening with her black 
    boyfriend Damon (Robert Cunningham), but he is adamant that he 
    doesn't want her to ever see him again. Carly says she knows the real 
    reason why he doesn't want her to see Damon, it's because he's black, 
    but Brent denies it, saying he was once seventeen, too, and he knows 
    how boys think at that age (Sex, Sex, Sex! Brent then says, &quot;Now 
    the world you kids are living in. The things you've seen on the 
    internet. Mouth to dildo, dildo to ass, ass to ass! Hi Brent! Anal 
    beads.&quot;!!!) and that's the reason he doesn't want her to <A HREF="mom_and_dad_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mom &amp; dad poster10a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>see
     him (It turns out later in the film that Brent is telling the truth; 
    the color of Damon's skin doesn't bother him, but he doesn't want his 
    daughter to turn out like her mother; pregnant at an early age, 
    destroying both of their lives!). While Brent is at his dead-end job 
    and Kendall is at a gym working out (she wants to have a 
    &quot;young&quot; body, like she had as a teenager), something 
    strange happens to every adult. For some undisclosed reason (we are 
    given very little information, except for a couple of quick shots 
    showing it could have come from TV screen static!) all adults now 
    want to kill their children, as Carly finds out with her best friend 
    Riley (Olivia Crocicchia) while she is in school. All the parents are 
    at the front of the school behind a police blockade, looking for 
    their children so thay can kill them! It doesn't take long for the 
    large group of parents to break-through the police blockade and rush 
    to find their children When they catch them, they put plastic bags 
    over their heads, impale them on flag poles and other grisly sights! 
    During this stampede, Carly and Riley escape and go to Riley's house, 
    where Riley's drunken Mom cuts her daughter's throat, but leaves 
    Carley alone. It seems the parents only want to kill their children 
    and no one else, that is, unless they get in the way (Even Damon's 
    father tries to kill him with a broken beer bottle, but Damon escapes 
    with only a cut on his arm. Then we get to the meat of the film, 
    where Carly rushes home to save her brother, only to discover 
    housekeeper Sun-Yi (Olivia Crocicchia) has murdered her own young 
    daughter and is cleaning up her blood on the floor. Since Carly knows 
    Sun-Yi&nbsp; won't hurt her or Josh, she tells her to go home, which 
    she does. Carly finds Josh under his bed and tells him to hurry, they 
    must get out of the house immediately before Mon and Dad get home, 
    but they are too late, as both Brent and Kendall arrive home with 
    murder on their mind. (In Brent and Kendall's state of mind during 
    this, they act like their marriage is perfect!). I won't tell you 
    what happens next, but I will say this: It is one of the most 
    inventive films of 2017, as Carly and Josh lock themselves in the 
    basement, so Mom and Dad come up with some very unique ways to force 
    their children out of the basement (Brent: &quot;Your motherfucking 
    mother said to open this door! And motherfuckers, you're going to 
    open this motherfucking door!&quot;). It's not only hilarious, but it 
    is also brutal, as the children always manage to escape just in the 
    nick of time. When they are cornered and it looks like it is the end 
    for Carly &amp; Josh, Brent's parents (played by an excellent Lance 
    Henriksen and&nbsp; Marilyn Dodds Frank) show up for dinner and guess 
    what they want to do? That's right, they want to kill Brent (and 
    Kendall when she gets in the way!). What happens next is best for you 
    to discover. If you are looking for answers why this is happening to 
    parents, you will be disappointed because this film gives you none 
    (It only implies it, as conspiracy nuts appear on TV saying that it 
    is a terrorist plot or our own government is doing it to control the 
    population. Even Doctor Oz has his own theory!), but this film needs 
    no answers because it is a riot from beginning to end. Nicolas Cage 
    is wonderful as a father who daydreams about his teenage years and 
    talks to Josh like he is an adult (I wish my father did this!). When 
    he threatens Carly with a battery-powered saw, he says, &quot;It's a 
    Sawzall. That means it saws ALL!&quot; I have to say that I laughed 
    so loud, soda shot out of my nose! Selma Blair is also remarkable as 
    the mother, who keeps on smiling and telling Carly, &quot;You're part 
    of a family, Carly, and that means you love each other even when you 
    can't stand each other, and you give a shit even when you don't give 
    a shit.&quot;, when all Kendall wants to do is kill her!

    will not want to murder their children after viewing it, but they 
    will understand all the nearly-hidden asides that tells them what it 
    takes to be a parent, warts and all. This is also a film that has the 
    perfect ending. I will not tell you how it ends, but the dialogue 
    spoken made me clap my hands in approval, even though I am not a 
    parent (This film basically showed me why I never wanted to become a 
    parent!). I haven't even touched on many of the film's outrageous 
    scenes, including Brent singing &quot;The Bunny Hop&quot; while he is

    this website know I'm not the biggest fan of anthology horror films, 
    but when they are done right, such as <B><A HREF="tales_from_the_crypt_1972.htm">TALES

    (1977) and <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#TrickRTreat">TRICK 'R TREAT</A></B> 
    (2007), they can be amazingly entertaining. So along comes <B><A HREF="ghost_stories_2017.htm">GHOST
     STORIES</A></B> (2017), a British anthology horror film with a 
    difference that is shocking and goosebump-inducing. Not so much the 
    three tales of supernatural horror that can't be explained 
    rationally, but, rather, the wraparound footage, which will have you 
    sitting on the edge of your seat. The wraparound footage concerns 
    Professor Goodman (co-director/co-screenwriter Andy Nyman; <B><A HREF="severance_2006.htm">SEVERANCE</A></B> 
    - 2006), the host of a show called &quot;Psychic Cheats&quot;, who is 
    a debunker of anything supernatural or psychic (We see him 
    interrupting a TV show of a fake psychic, who is getting his 
    information on an audience member via radio transmitter in his ear 
    from a woman backstage, telling the crying female audience member 
    that this psychic is a disgusting sham). Professor Goodman has spent 
    his entire life debunking the supernatural and has had no time<A HREF="ghost_stories_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ghost stories 2017 poster small1a.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    for a personal or family life; he a bachelor by choice and somewhat 
    of a prig who needs to be taken down a peg). Goodman receives an 
    audio cassette tape from his childhood hero, supernatural debunker 
    Charles Cameron (Leonard Byrne), who disappeared years ago and was 
    considered long dead, but the tape tells Goodman where to meet him, 
    he has something important to give him. This leads Goodman to a 
    trailer where the sickly Cameron tells Professor Goodman that he was 
    wrong his entire life, the supernatural is, indeed, real. Goodman 
    can't believe his ears, thinking Cameron is too ill to know what he 
    is saying, but Cameron hands him a folder that contains dossiers on 
    three men, telling him to investigate their experiences with the 
    supernatural and then make up his own mind if the supernatural is 
    real or not. This leads Professor Goodman to document the three men's 
    cases, starting with security guard Tony Matthews (Paul Whitehouse; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BurkeAndHare2010">BURKE

    - 2010), then creepy teenager Simon Rifkind (Alex Lawther, who is 
    chilling in his mannerisms) and, finally, new father Mike Priddle 
    (Martin Freeman; <B><A HREF="shaun_of_the_dead_2003.htm">SHAUN OF THE DEAD</A></B> 
    - 2003), as they relay their supernatural stories to Goodman. Believe 
    me, their stories are nothing spectacular (although Mike Priddle does 
    something shocking and totally unexpected at the end of his story), 
    it's what happens after the three tales are over that will have you 
    shaking in your boots. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but I will 
    say that all three tales are intercut with an establishing shot that 
    seems to make little sense until the film's finale. When the 
    establishing shot is revealed at the end, it will send chills 
    starting from your feet and traveling to the top of your head. At 
    least it did for me. If the film seems disjointed, it was done on 
    purpose (Such as when Professor Goodman says &quot;Can we cut?&quot; 
    in Cameron's trailer when he reveals he's not who he seems to be, 
    thinking he is taping an episode of his TV show), as the ending of 
    the wraparound episode exposes the shocking reveal and suddenly 
    everything begins to make sense. Are all three stories related? Damn 
    straight they are, but not in the way you would expect. That's all 
    I'm going to say. Co-directors/co-screenwriters Andy Nyman and Jeremy 
    Dyson do a bang-up job of keeping viewers on their toes (it was based 
    on a play they both put on a London stage) and it makes the film 
    totally re-watchable, thanks to the reveal in the end. That final 
    shot will stay in your memory for a long, long time (I doubt I will 
    ever forget it), not that it is shocking, but rather because it is 
    the perfect way to end the film. The makeup effects are outstanding 
    and are used judiciously and the jump scares are effective and don't 
    seem tacked-on like most modern day supernatural films. (especially 
    the ones coming from BlumHouse). This is my new favorite anthology 
    film (Not that I have many, although I do love &quot;The Raft&quot; 
    episode in <B><A HREF="creepshow_2_1987.htm">CREEPSHOW 2</A></B> 
    [1987]. That's my problem with anthology films. You may like one of 
    the stories and the others may suck.) and, once you watch it, it may 
    be your's, too. I saw it on Hulu and Amazon Prime also airs it 
    streaming, but even Prime members have to pay to see it. Just see it 
    and make up your own mind!;<A NAME="MadamYank2017"></A> <B>Handsome 
    men make the best tasting hot dogs.</B> At least I think so! I 
    usually don't review films that are devoid of horror, gory violence, 
    nudity or any of the other things that make horror films tick, but 
    along comes <B><A HREF="madam_yankelovas_fine_literature_club_2017.htm">MADAM
     YANKELOVA'S FINE LITERATURE CLUB</A></B> (2017), a dark Israeli 
    production that is half fantasy, half adult fairy tale and 100% 
    weird. In some alternate Earthly dimension, a group of women have 
    formed a secret club called &quot;The House Of Lordesses&quot;, a 
    place where love is forbidden, especially with a man. Younger members 
    of the club pick up men at the library they work in as librarians, 
    invite them to a weekly dinner/literary club reading, where the men 
    are then trapped in special chairs and have ball gags applied to 
    their mouths so they can't scream. The woman with the best looking 
    man (measurements are taken of his head, ears and distance between 
    his eyes!) and the man with the highest point score wins the woman 
    who brought him a plastic statue. When the woman wins 100 statues, 
    she becomes a senior Lordess. Those that don't win 100 statues or are 
    too old to entice men become members of the staff Cleaning and 
    Sanitation Department, who are tormented by the senior members (it is 
    basically a slave job). Now I don't know if the men are turned into 
    hot dogs, but it is implied earlier in the film, as member Sophie 
    (Keren Mor), who is getting on in years, has just won her 99th 
    trophy, must stab to death the man she brought to dinner (offscreen) 
    and we <A HREF="madam_yankelovas_fine_literature_club_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/madam yankelova's fine literature club poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>immediately
     see members of the cooking staff making hot dogs (lots of them!), 
    which they sell in a park carnival attraction. Sophie's best friend 
    is cleaning staff member Hannah (Hana Laslo), who doesn't want Sophie 
    to become a Cleaning and Sanitation Department member, because it is 
    looked down by all the other members of the club. She helps Sophie 
    get men that will win the weekly contest, but one day, Hannah up and 
    disappears. It turns out that Hannah has found a man who loves her 
    and she loves him, breaking the club's cardinal rule of &#147;Falling 
    In Love is Not Allowed&#148;, as it is considered a false emotion. 
    Sophie is relentlessly harassed by the senior members and the 
    beautiful Lola (Ania Bukstein) as to the location of Hannah, as 
    members are not allowed to leave the club ever, especially if they 
    fall in love. When Lola moves into the apartment next to Sophie (it 
    use to be Hannah's pad) to spy on her (Sophie finds a bug in the eye 
    of a portrait of Madam Yankelova [Leah Koenig], the most senior 
    member of the club, so Lola can listen to every word she says), it 
    becoames complicated for Sophie when she finds a man she really likes 
    (Yiftach Klein), sneaking him into her apartment to cook him dinner 
    (She drugs Lola's wine with sleeping pills so she is sound asleep 
    when he comes over and leaves very early the next morning). Long 
    story short, Sophie begins falling in love with him, not knowing that 
    he is an undercover cop who was hired by senior Lordess Razia (Razia 
    Israeli), who is Chief of Police (!), to locate Hannah. She doesn't 
    want to bring him to the weekly dinner to become a victim, but when 
    he follows her and locates Hannah, who is about to fly to Paris with 
    her true love, she really has no choice, since Razia tells Sophie if 
    she doesn't bring at least an &quot;8.5&quot; to the next dinner, she 
    will be demoted to the Cleaning and Sanitation Department 
    immediately. What happens next is pretty shocking (Both Hannah and 
    her lover are hung in front of everyone at the dinner) and Sophie is 
    handed the knife to stab her new love to death. Will she do it? While 
    the ending was a little too pat for my liking, there is no doubt that 
    this film is eerily atmospheric in a fairy tale-like way. All the 
    members of the club live frugal lives, as their apartments contain no 
    extraneous furniture (except for a shelf to display their statues), 
    paintings (except for Madam Yankelova's portrait) or other objects we 
    take for granted (such as TVs). Their lives are devoted to the club 
    and nothing else. Freshman feature film director/co writer (with 
    Yossi Meiri) Guilhad Emilio Schenker has turned in a film that is 
    very haunting and sparse at the same time. Its dark story covers up 
    what the film is really about: Finding true love and just going for 
    it, even if it is an emotion they were told doesn't exist. The heart 
    wants what it wants. There are many fine scenes in this film, such as 
    Sophie putting her new love's arms around her body while he sleeps 
    (she actually drugged him with the sleeping pills!) and discovering a 
    feeling she never experienced before. This English-subtitled film is 
    full of these &quot;new&quot; experiences and some of it is quite 
    touching. It is also shocking at the same time, as the viewer is 
    always kept guessing what is coming next. There's no blood or overt 
    violence here (well, there is some bloodless violence at the end of 
    the film), but viewers who are into such things (as I am) will find a 
    lot to enjoy here, especially the acting by the cast. It seems real 
    and immediate, unlike most films made today, especially Keren Mor as 
    Sophie and Ania Bukstein as Lola, who keeps her youthful looks by 
    injecting her face with Botox. You'll find yourself rooting for 
    Sophie, as she tries to keep her love a secret from everyone else, 
    not knowing that her true love is a cop, who is looking into the 
    disappearance of another cop (Sophie had him as one of her previous 
    victims!) and his father years earlier (which was one of Razia's 
    victims), as well as trying to locate Hannah. All the women keep 
    Polaroids of their previous victims in heart-shaped boxes (How's that 
    for symbolism!), but none of them realize that a heart means love. If 
    you want to watch something different (it may be too slow for some 
    viewers), I recommend you give this film a look. It is sure to be 
    something special to a lot of people who never heard of it before 
    (Available streaming on Amazon Prime and on YouTube, from channel 
    &quot;Horror Central&quot;). It's not perfect, but it is very involving.;<A NAME="ThisOldMachine2017"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="this_old_machine_2017.htm">THIS OLD MACHINE</A></B> 
    (2017) is an unusual tale of revenge and mystery where the acting and 
    dialogue is about as natural as it gets, but it's not totally 
    successful, yet still worth a viewing. From the moment the film 
    starts we can see that the marriage of Vint (Justin Geer; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#MotorHomeMassacre">MOTOR
     HOME MASSACRE</A></B> - 2005) and Kay (Sylvia Jefferies; <B><A HREF="#ThreeFromHell2019">3
     FROM HELL</A></B> - 2019) is a troubled one. Kay's parents hate Vint 
    and want Kay to leave him (he has a temper and is addicted to 
    vaping), but Kay wants to see if they can work things out. They take 
    a hiking trip into the woods, where they meet Lew (Lance Henriksen; <B><A HREF="#MomAndDad2017">MOM
     AND DAD</A></B> - 2017), an elderly man who is seemingly<A HREF="this_old_machine_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/this old machine amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    having a heart attack. Vint carries Lew to the car and goes to drive 
    him to the hospital with Kay attending to him in the backseat, but we 
    soon find out that Lew was faking it, as he injects something into 
    Vint's neck (it happened so quickly, it took me totally by surprise 
    and I jumped a little). Vint then wakes up in a small brook 
    completely naked and in terrible shape. Not only is one eye closed 
    shut and swollen, but Vint's penis has been cut off! Vint stumbles 
    through the woods until he is able to flag down a car, passing out 
    before he can know what is happening. Vint wakes up in a hospital, 
    the nurse telling him he has been in a coma for three months and when 
    he asks where Kay is, no one seems to know, the police declaring her 
    dead. Vint also has a case of amnesia and has no idea of what 
    happened to him (he now has to wear an ileostomy bag to collect his 
    urine since his penis was never found), but bits and pieces of what 
    happened to him and Kay come to his memory as the film progresses. 
    Vint goes to his home and finds Kay's sixteen-year-old daughter Mia 
    (Clair Danielle Canterbury) is living upstairs. He lets Mia stay when 
    she tells him she has nowhere to go, she is no longer welcome at her 
    parents house (for reasons not explained). Mia becomes Vint's ad hoc 
    nurse, taking care of him while Vint recuperates from his physical 
    and mental wounds. When Vint takes an overdose of pain medication and 
    Mia finds him lying next to the toilet, Vint begs her to let him be; 
    if he dies he dies, but if he lives through the night he will be a 
    changed man and will try to discover what exactly happened to him and 
    Kay. He makes it through the night and changes his attitude about 
    life and death. His neighbor is constantly playing heavy metal music 
    loudly in his car, so Vint confronts him, learning that he once knew 
    the man, Lyle (Kevin Sorbo; <B><A HREF="#BooneBounty2016">BOONE: THE 
    BOUNTY HUNTER</A></B> - 2016), a drug-addled junkie who talks in 
    riddles (Sorbo is pretty good here, something I never thought I would 
    say!), but Vint has no recollection of him. Long story short, Vint 
    breaks into Lyle's home and tries to steal one of his rifles, but 
    Lyle catches him, letting him keep the rifle, saying it's old and he 
    doesn't even know it it works (Lyle says, &quot;Ah, men with their 
    toys. They die just like us and their toys are worthless to 
    them.&quot;). Vint knows from the police what town he was in when he 
    and Kay disappeared, so he sets out to drive to the town, but Mia 
    tells him he is going nowhere without her. She, too, wants to know 
    what happened to her sister. They go to the only hotel in town and 
    the woman behind the desk gives him an address, but won't tell him 
    anything else because she values her life. Mia, meantime, gets the 
    same address from a young guy trying to hit on her as she is waiting 
    in the car. They drive to the address, an old farm that Vint has no 
    recollection of, yet someone fires a gun at them. Mia grabs the rifle 
    from Vint and proves to be a good shot, fatally wounding the person 
    who fired at them. The man whispers something into Vint's ear before 
    dying, leading them to the farm's house. Once Vint and Mia enter the 
    house, they can see two boys jumping out a second floor window and 
    running away. Vint goes upstairs while Mia goes outside and kills one 
    of the boys with the rifle, the other one getting away. Vint meets a 
    man upstairs who tries to kill him with a knife, stabbing Vint in his 
    stomach. The man recognizes Vint, but Vint has no idea who he is, the 
    man telling him that he's broke, he spent all the money. Vint shoots 
    him in the head with a pistol and heads outside, where he finds Irene 
    (Dee Wallace; <B><A HREF="#RedChristmas2016">RED CHRISTMAS</A></B> - 
    2016; in a two minute cameo) lying on the ground with a broken leg 
    after jumping out the second story window. She refuses to tell Vint 
    anything, so Vint kills her (we don't see it) and he and Mia pick up 
    the little boy who got away, telling them he was going to his 
    grandfater's house. That grandfather turns out to be Lew, who is 
    having a small birthday party for his granddaughter. When Vint holds 
    a rifle on Lew, he acts all innocent, saying he knows who he is, but 
    has no idea what he is talking about. Lew then gets the upper hand, 
    injecting Vint with the same drug he injected into him three months 
    ago, but Vint pulls the trigger and kills Lew's adult son. Mia tries 
    to run away, but Lew's teenage grandson punches her in the face, 
    knocking her out. Lew then puts Vint's unconscious body in a cart and 
    drive him into the woods. Vint wakes up, still unable to move, as Lew 
    opens a wooden hatch on the forest floor that dumps into a 
    quicksand-like marsh. Vint wants to know what happened to Kay, but 
    all Lew will tell him is that he will meet her soon, also telling him 
    that he got all the money he could milk out of the people who wanted 
    him hurt badly. We then discover that Vint was a dastardly, mean and 
    vicious person before he woke up in the hospital. He would beat up 
    Kay just for the hell of it, a worthless human being. Lew then dumps 
    Vint's body into the marsh, where he dies. Mia wakes up in the 
    basement of Lew's house and discovers that her hands are tied with 
    barb wire. There's a small refrigerator next to he and when she opens 
    it, she finds hypodermic needles in it. Lew's grandson then comes 
    downstairs and tries to ass-rape Mia, but Mia has a needle in her 
    hand and injects air into his penis, and he immediately dies. Mia 
    escapes, gets into the car and drives back to Vint's house, where she 
    finds Kay rummaging through a closet looking for her jewels. She 
    tells Mia that she paid for the hit on Vint, with their parents' 
    financial help, found a new man and is going away with him as soon as 
    she can find her jewelry. In a scene that very <A HREF="this_old_machine_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/this old machine korea poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>confusing,
     Mia tells her the jewelry is in the upstairs closet and we then hear 
    Kay scream out, dead on the floor (How in the fuck was she killed?). 
    Mia then runs outside and we hear her scream. Is everyone dead? I'm 
    afraid we never find out. While not a good film by any stretch of the 
    imagination, freshman director/screenwriter Brad Garris (who hasn't 
    directed anything since, as this review was written in April of 2021) 
    has made a film that is very interesting, yet also maddening in the 
    way things are revealed without any explanations. It's like Garris 
    wanted the viewer to make up their own minds as to what was 
    happening. Truth be told, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, 
    even though it is indifferently acted by some members of the cast 
    (I'm still trying to figure out why Dee Wallace took a two minute 
    cameo that is basically worthless and offers us nothing). Lance 
    Henriksen makes for a very believable bad guy, but only appears at 
    the beginning and end of the film, his screentime amounting to less 
    than ten minutes. The dialogue is the feast here, as it seems 
    natural, the way people in this type of situation would talk (except 
    for Kevin Sorbo's character, a religious fanatic in real life who 
    plays against type here). Justin Geer is amazing as Vint and his line 
    delivery is about as good as it gets. Some people on IMDb complain 
    about his acting and give the film one star out of ten, but they are 
    missing the point. There are no good people in this film, not even 
    Mia (watch the film to find out why). Everyone here has an agenda or 
    is a very bad person from the get-go, especially Vint, who is 
    probably the worst person of all, but he doesn't realize just how bad 
    he is after waking up from the coma. Lew has to remind him. There are 
    no heroes here, only people you would hate if you ever met them. 
    That's what makes this film so special to me. All I can say is give 
    this film a chance. You may like it as much as I did. It's available 
    streaming on Amazon Prime to members and also on YouTube for free.</FONT></FONT></P>

     WARRIOR 2</A></B> (2017). To tell the truth, I never saw the first 
    chapter of this China action film, but you really don't need to view 
    it to understand what is going on here. I'm also going to put my 
    political views aside strictly to review this film on its merits, as 
    it's very anti-American; shoving its Chinese propaganda in the 
    viewer's face, but there's no denying that this is one helluva action 
    flick, full of bloody, gory deaths and some excellent wire work 
    stunts, some so unbelievable, you'll have to rewind the film to make 
    sure you saw what you saw. A former China Special Forces soldier, 
    Leng Feng (Wu Jing, who also directed and co-wrote this film), is 
    jailed for three years for manslaughter, when he kills a ruthless 
    real estate developer who threatens the life of the family of his 
    best friend, who was killed on a previous mission. When in prison, 
    his fiancee, Long Xiaoyun (Nan Yu), is killed when she goes on a 
    mission in Africa, the only clue to who killed her is a special 
    spiral bullet that was removed from her body.&nbsp; Leng wears that 
    bullet around his neck and, three years later, he works security on 
    ships in Africa, preventing them from being hijacked by pirates (The 
    film opens with Leng saving a ship from a pirate attack all by 
    himself [impressive underwater stunts]). He has been trying to 
    identify the bullet, with no luck,<A HREF="wolf_warrior_2_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/wolf warrior 2 poster8a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    until a shopkeeper, whom he saves from a Rebel attack, tells him that 
    he knows where the bullet came from. This leads to the meat of the 
    film, where Leng fights a mercenary group led by American &quot;Big 
    Daddy&quot; (Frank Grillo; <B><A HREF="avengers_endgame_2019.htm">AVENGERS:
     ENDGAME</A></B> - 2019), who was hired by the leader of Rebel forces 
    to take over an African nation by any means possible, even if it 
    means killing women and children (this film has no problem showing 
    mercenaries and Rebels killing helpless women and children, 
    especially in one village where Leng witnesses it for himself, saving 
    a group of Chinese people and African nationals alike, while he 
    watches ruthless mercenaries/Rebels shooting kids and women 
    point-blank without showing any emotion whatsoever. It's quite 
    shocking.). The Rebels are after&nbsp; a certain Dr. Chen (Qiucheng 
    Guo), who may have found the antidote for a previously incurable 
    plague that is sweeping the country, killing everyone within four 
    hours of being infected with it. Long story short, violent mercenary 
    Bear (Oleg Prudius) kills Dr. Chen and before he dies, he makes Leng 
    promise to protect his adoptive daughter Pasha (Diana Sylla) and 
    fellow doctor Rachel (Celina Jade) from the Rebel forces. Leng then 
    teams up with an old grizzled soldier He Jianguo (Gang Wu) and 
    hotshot young soldier-wannabe Zhuo Yifan (Hans Zhang) and the fight 
    of good versus evil is on. The rest of the film is one battle after 
    the next, each one bigger and badder than the one before. The final 
    battle, involving tanks, is one for the record books, as I have never 
    seen a more outlandish series of stunts performed before, especially 
    watching one mercenary getting run over by a tank's treads, squishing 
    him to a bloody pulp. While there is some obvious CGI (involving 
    explosions and fire), it's not enough of a turn-off to take your eyes 
    off the screen, as bodies are ripped apart by large-caliber gunfire 
    and Leng uses the metal coils of a mattress to stop a hand-fired 
    rocket launcher grenade! There are so many outrageous stunts here 
    that it's hard to come up with anything negative to say, but I will 
    say this: it was mighty convenient finding out Pasha was a cure for 
    the plague, especially when Leng catches it and she cures him with a 
    simple blood transfusion! While I found it hard to ignore all the 
    anti-America propaganda that's littered throughout the film, I had to 
    remind myself that our action films do the same exact thing; 
    sometimes China is the enemy in those films and we portray them just 
    as they do us in this film, so turnabout is fair play. It should also 
    be noted that this&nbsp; film was China's highest grossing movie of 
    all time, making over 850 million dollars in China alone! So if it's 
    violent, bloody action you want, mixed with some very unique stunts, 
    you would be hard-pressed to come up with a better film than this. 
    Oh, and make sure to stick around after the end credits for a stinger 
    that will lead into Part Three.;<A NAME="DeadAnt2017"></A> Killer ant

     You gotta love a film that opens with a Native American named 
    &quot;Bigfoot&quot; (Michael Horse; TV's <B><A HREF="twin_peaks_tv_series.htm">TWIN
     PEAKS</A></B> [1990-1991]) and his diminutive sidekick Firecracker 
    (a hilarious Danny Woodburn; <B><A HREF="lavalantula_2015.htm">LAVALANTULA</A></B> 
    - 2015) selling peyote to a young pretty woman, Bigfoot telling her 
    the name of this peyote is &quot;Sun&quot; and she must only take it 
    when the sun goes down and whatever she does, she is not to kill 
    anything, not even an insect, because there will be hell to pay if 
    she does. We then see the pretty woman running away from a giant ant, 
    stripping off pieces of her clothing as she runs away, until she is 
    totally naked (nothing is hidden from the viewer). The ant then kills 
    her (offscreen). Was the pretty young woman simply tripping on the 
    peyote or did this actually happen? The film then switches over to 
    one-hit-wonder hair metal band Sonic Grave (Their only hit was a 
    power ballad in 1989), who are on their way to &quot;Nochella&quot;, 
    a third-rate Coachella-like festival (only with bands no one ever 
    heard of), located in the middle of the desert. The band members 
    include guitarist/songwriter Pager (Rhys Coiro; <B><A HREF="straw_dogs_2011.htm">STRAW
     DOGS</A></B> - 2011), lead singer Merrick (a great Jake Busey; <B><A HREF="starship_troopers_1997.htm">STARSHIP
     TROOPERS</A></B> - 1997), drummer Stevie (Leisha Hailey) and bassist 
    Art (a bloated Sean Astin; <B><A HREF="cabin_fever_patient_zero_2014.htm">CABIN
     FEVER: PATIENT ZERO</A></B> - 2014). Their manager, Danny (A 
    wonderful Tom Arnold; <B><A HREF="curse_of_downers_grove_2014.htm">THE
     CURSE OF DOWNERS GROVE</A></B> - 2014; who gets off some hilarious 
    one-liners, such as, &quot;I'm not a creeper. I have court documents 
    to prove it!&quot;), who has stuck with the band since their 
    inception, hopes this festival is the chance the band needs to become 
    popular again, because he has seen both the good and the bad and, for 
    the last thirty years, it has mostly been bad. Pager, Merrick, Danny 
    and band groupie Lover (Cameron Richardson; <B><A HREF="rise_blood_hunter_2006.htm">RISE:
     BLOOD HUNTER</A></B> - 2006) are in the trailer while Stevie drives 
    the truck, Art riding shotgun. They have to make one stop, an organic 
    fruit stand run by Bigfoot and Firecracker to pick up some peyote for 
    a last &quot;group trip&quot; before the festival (Stevie tries to 
    educate Art, telling him calling someone an &quot;Indian&quot; is 
    racist, the proper term in &quot;Native American&quot;. Art tells 
    Stevie, &quot;I'm from the Shire, so I never heard of that&quot;, a 
    wink towards the <A HREF="lord_of_the_rings_trilogy.htm"><B>LORD OF 
    THE RINGS</B> trilogy</A> [2001 - 2003] he appeared in, directed by 
    Peter Jackson). Stevie and Art meet the imposing Bigfoot, who sells 
    them some &quot;Sun&quot;, but warns them that if they even hurt a 
    fly, they will bring hell down upon them. Art doesn't take him 
    seriously and, after buying some Sun and getting back in the truck 
    (As he is leaving, Art yells out, &quot;Thanks, Chief&quot; to 
    Bigfoot!), eats some of the peyote early, not waiting for them to 
    camp out at Joshua Tree. When they finally get to their campsite, a 
    tripping Art wanders out in the desert, where he gets bitten by a 
    regular-size ant. Instead of stepping on it, Art pisses on it and he 
    imagines (?) the ant speaking to him just before it dies, telling him 
    he has opened a can of worms and he will be dead soon. While everyone 
    back at the campsite enjoys the peyote (except for a disappointed 
    Danny, because Pager eats a large amout of the peyote, leaving none 
    for Danny, so he turns to a bottle of Jack Daniels instead), Art is 
    attacked by a swarm of fist-sized ants, that cover his body, eating 
    off all his skin. Later, at sundown, the band notice Art is missing, 
    so they go looking for him (except for Merrick, who is tripping so 
    hard, he thinks he has wings and can fly, so he climbs a large rock 
    and jumps off, breaking his leg and saying, &quot;My wings failed 
    me!&quot;), discovering Art, who is still (barely) alive, is covered 
    with fist-sized ants. Pager and Stevie try to beat the ants off Arts 
    body, but when Pager pulls on Art's arm, it comes off (!), so Pager 
    kills one of the ants with Art's severed arm. A short time later, 
    everyone is attacked by even bigger ants, trapping them in their 
    trailer, along with a groupie named Sam (Sydney Sweeney; <B><A HREF="ward_2010.htm">THE
     WARD</A></B> - 2010), whose friend Lisa (Joi Liaye) is trapped in 
    their car. The trapped people in the trailer watch as Lisa tries to 
    fight the large ants off with some hairspray and a lighter, but she 
    dies when the car explodes, killing one of the large ants. A short 
    time later, everyone are attacked by even bigger ants, who carry the 
    trailer and truck a short distance, Danny losing one of his hands 
    when it is bitten off by a giant ants pincers, which is killed. 
    Stevie then realizes that when an ant is killed, they all become 
    exponentially larger after a short period of rest, so they use this 
    rest period and try to escape, only Art had the keys to the truck, so 
    they must find Art's body. When they find Art's body (or what's left 
    of it!), Stevie pulls the truck keys out of his pants pocket and they 
    drive off only in the truck, a horde of even bigger ants chasing 
    them. They make it to Nochella, but so do<A HREF="dead_ant_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/dead ant poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    the giant ants. Bigfoot and Firecracker are at the festival with bow 
    and dynamite-tipped arrows, hand grenades and a bazooka to stop the 
    ants, but there are just too many of them and the ants begin to 
    chow-down on the festival goers. Sonic Grave take to the stage and 
    play their old power ballad, where they discover Merrick's singing 
    voice makes the ants' heads explode (!), so he sings the power ballad 
    like he has never sung it before, killing all the ants and Sonic 
    Grave becoming a hit with the surviving audience members, who give 
    them a standing ovation. Sonic Grave is back, baby! I can go 
    on-and-on how funny this film is, but you'll have to see for yourself 
    (a lot of the dialogue is priceless), because that's half the 
    fun.&nbsp; To tell the truth, some of the ant CGI is very well done, 
    but the CGI blood is also quite noticable, bringing the film down a 
    peg for me (please stop doing this, as it takes you out of the 
    film!). The real highlight here, besides Tom Arnold, who has never 
    been better, is Jake Busey as Merrick, who not only kills his role, 
    he turns out to be an excellent singer, as we hear Sonic Grave's new 
    song &quot;<A HREF="dead_ant_2017.htm#SideBoob">Side Boob</A>&quot; 
    play over the closing credits. It's actually quite good, with lyrics 
    that will make you laugh out loud (rhyming &quot;cherry cola&quot; 
    with areola&quot;!). I would also speculate, that if more people 
    heard this song, it would get a lot of radio play, it's that good. 
    Truth be told, everyone is excellent here and director Ron Carlson, 
    who also wrote the screenplay, based on a story by Hank Braxtan (the 
    director/writer of <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm#ChemicalPeel2012">CHEMICAL
     PEEL</A></B> [2012] and <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm#Unnatural2015">UNNATURAL</A></B> 
    [2015]) and his writing partner Dan Sinclair, keeps the film moving 
    at such a fast pace so you don't realize how obviously corny the film 
    actually is. It won't hit you until the film is actually over, but 
    you won't be disappointed. I love this film and recommend it 
    whole-heartedly. Look for low-budget genre actor Shawn C. Phillips (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#WitchsBrew2011">WITCH'S
     BREW</A></B> - 2011) as a Nochella Festival-goer who gets trapped in

    as <B><A HREF="dead_ant_2017.htm#GiantKillerAnts">GIANT KILLER ANTS</A></B> 
    in the U.K. and <B><A HREF="dead_ant_2017.htm#MonstersVsMetal">DEAD 
    ANT - MONSTERS VS. METAL</A></B> in Germany. Under any title, this 
    film is must-viewing!;<A NAME="UltimateJustice2017"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The reason why I haven't reviewed many B-movie action films made in 
    the New Millennium in this section is because they usually boring, 
    follow the same old formula and, let's face it, they suck. Not so for <B><A HREF="ultimate_justice_2017.htm">ULTIMATE
     JUSTICE</A></B> (2017). It's a slice of '90s-era B-action flick 
    Heaven, with two actors that will make you nostalgic for action films 
    of the '90s: Mark Dacascos (<B><A HREF="drive_1997.htm">DRIVE</A></B> 
    - 1997) and Matthias Hues (<B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#Mission Of Justice">MISSION
     OF JUSTICE</A></B> - 1992), who have appeared in three other action 
    films together before this one. But the real star of this film (at 
    least I think so) is Mike M&ouml;ller, a man short in stature, but 
    high kicking when it comes to martial arts fighting, making him look 
    like a combination MMA fighter and a well-trained wrestler who knows 
    all the moves. His fighting skill is the main attraction of this 
    film, in my opinion. The film opens up with a team of ex-Special 
    Forces soldiers saving a kidnapped son from terrorists when his rich 
    father refuses to pay the ransom. It results in the death of a female 
    member, which is too much for the leader of the team, Gus von Behren 
    (Mark Dacascos; <B><A HREF="john_wick_chapter_3_parabellum_2019.htm">JOHN
     WICK: CHAPTER 3 - PARABELLUM</A></B> - 2019), so he sells his 
    security company, which he and partner Hans-Georg Sturm (Wolfgang 
    Riehm; <B><A HREF="fangoria_presents_dvds.htm">SIN REAPER</A></B> - 
    2012) had equal shares in. At a party a few months later, Hans meets 
    a beautiful woman named Michaela (Sandra Tauro), which makes him very 
    happy, since he is older than most everyone at the party. Eight years 
    pass and we see Gus and a date arriving at Hans and Michaela's home 
    to have dinner. Hans and Michaela are now married and have a 
    beautiful young 8-year-old daughter. Michaela pulls Gus to the side 
    and says something is bothering Hans; he has been to the doctor 
    several times and he refuses to talk about it. Gus says he will talk 
    to Hans and when he does, Hans tells him he has the feeling he is 
    being followed and his instincts are very seldom wrong. That night, 
    three masked people enter Hans' house and beat him up, making him 
    watch as one of the masked men punches Michaela in the face, rapes 
    her and then shoots her in the head. They then kidnap his young 
    daughter and tell him they will be in contact for the ransom. When 
    Gus discovers what has happened, he decides to put his old team back 
    together to rescue Han's daughter. The team includes the muscle of 
    the team, Frank Radowsky (Matthias Hues; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Digital Man">DIGITAL
     MAN</A></B> - 1994), heavy arms expert Joachim 'Joe' Weller (Mike 
    Leeder; <B><A HREF="pound_of_flesh_2015.htm">POUND OF FLESH</A></B> - 
    2015), close range combat expert Benjamin 'Benny' Scholz (Mike 
    M&ouml;ller; <B><A HREF="half_past_dead_2002.htm">HALF PAST DEAD</A></B> 
    - 2002), reconnaissance/light arms expert Heinrich 'Henry' Stelle 
    (Henry Muller), weapons expert Thomas Brenner (Mathis Landwehr), <!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ultimate justice 2017 poster1a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="164" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0">computer
     expert Florian 'Flo' Weisshaupt (Martin Baden) and 
    sharpshooter/sniper Julia Schwertbacher (Yazmeen Baker), the only 
    female on the team (As you can probably tell, this is a 
    Germany-financed film). The only member who is not on board is 
    Andreas 'Doc' Clemens (Brandon Rhea), who has a talent for making 
    anyone talk, usually by violent means (including blow-torches and 
    nailing people's hands to the chair). He is now a monk, who is trying 
    to atone for his past life (he is also having an affair with Julia), 
    but he soon comes on board when the team needs him the most. 
    Reviewing the security footage at Hans' house at the time of the 
    kidnapping, they discover a tattoo on one of the kidnappers' neck and 
    go to every tattoo parlor looking for the artist. After finding him, 
    Doc tortures him until he comes up with the name of the person who 
    has the tattoo. Frank holds that man by his legs over a building 
    until he gives them the names of his accomplices, but a bullet, 
    seeming fired by Julia across the street on another rooftop, hits 
    Frank in the chest and he drops the man before he can give them the 
    names. The team chases Julia until they catch her, but she says she 
    did not fire the shot, she had to leave her position for a minute and 
    when she came back, someone hit her on the head and used her sniper 
    rifle to shoot Frank. No one believes her except Doc, because no one 
    on the team ever leaves their position under any circumstances, yet 
    Julie refuses to tell them why she did leave her position. (it's not 
    that difficult to know why she did). That's all I'm going to tell 
    you, as this film is non-stop action from the get-go. The gunfights 
    are bloody, the chases are exciting and the hand-to-hand combat is 
    astoundingly violent, especially from Mike M&ouml;ller, who will 
    leave you slack-jawed at some of the moves he puts on the enemy. I 
    will tell you this: The kidnapping concerns a one-night affair 
    Michaela had with Gus before she married Hans eight years ago. 
    Director Martin Christopher Bode, in his feature film debut, shows a 
    sure hand with the material (the screenplay is by Marco Theiss, with 
    the English language version written by co-star Mike Leeder, who has 
    a very long resume in Asian actioners) and keeps things moving at a 
    very brisk pace, so much so that you'll probably ignore the gaping 
    plot holes in the story. Don't expect a happy ending here, as many of 
    the &quot;good guys&quot; end up dead in very violent and gory 
    fashion (one person is shot in the head and he has a gaping, bloody 
    exit wound on the other side of his head). I will say I enjoyed every 
    minute of the film, overlooking the obvious English dubbing done by 
    some of the cast (Decascos and Leeder are two people who use their 
    own voices, as I know both of theirs' very well), but it is in no way 
    a deal-breaker. This is one of the best B-action films I have seen in 
    a long, long time. It's ultra-violent, high kicking (M&ouml;ller's 
    moves are done without the help of wires, which is simply amazing, 
    and Decascos still can kick like back in the old days. In fact, he 
    doesn't seem to age!). Matthias Hues is, unfortunately, on the 
    sideline for most of the film, recuperating from his chest wound, but 
    he still has the muscle structure to be a very imposing figure. His 
    face may have aged, but his body is still impressive. If you like 
    '90s action films (If you do and have a Roku player, you should watch 
    B-Movie TV, as they show many '90s action flicks!), this one should 
    cure your jones for the time being. It's nostalgia Heaven!;<A NAME="Lost&amp;Found2017"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

     &amp; FOUND: THE TRUE HOLLYWOOD STORY OF SILVER SCREEN CINEMA 
    PICTURES INTERNATIONAL</A></B> (2017), not only for its long title, 
    but also because it's a faux documentary, but damn if I couldn't help 
    myself but like it, if only for the talking head sections, which are 
    full of people I know from the &quot;business&quot;. The film is 
    about the fake production company in the title, abbreviated as SSCPI, 
    an extremely low-budget company that produced grindhouse style films 
    for the drive-in circuit and local fleapits. For 18 years, beginning 
    in 1967, SSCPI made ultra-cheapie films that jumped on the bandwagon 
    of popular themes of their period, whether it be beach/monster 
    flicks, blaxploitation, WIP, <B><A HREF="star_wars_1977.htm">STAR WARS</A></B> 
    clones and slasher films.&nbsp; In 1984, SSCPI's founder, Morris 
    &#147;Stogie&#148; Carlisle (Dave Bailey), gathered every print of 
    every film SSCPI made at his warehouse for transfer to VHS, when the 
    warehouse caught fire and every print was lost, SSCPI becoming a 
    faint memory, the films long lost and basically forgotten (The film 
    tries to find out if &quot;Stogie&quot;<A HREF="lost_&amp;_found_the_true_hollywood_story_of_silver_screen_cinema_pictures_international_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/lost and found 2017 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    intentionally started the fire for an insurance settlement or if it 
    was an accident). Then, in 2013, SSCPI's longtime female editor 
    passed away and her children found a case containing reels of film of 
    eleven trailers she cut of SSCPI's output. This documentary shows 
    these cheap trailers as the main crux of the film. But it's not the 
    trailers that interested me, because they were just the regular, 
    shot-on-digital faux films with computer generated emulsion 
    scratches, missing frames, dialogue jumps and intentional bad acting, 
    none of them very interesting or funny. It's the talking head 
    sections between the trailers that interested me, as people such as 
    Fangoria's Michael Gingold and <A HREF="http://www.templeofschlock.blogspot.com">Temple
     Of Schlock</A>'s Chris Poggiali reminisce about the good old days, 
    mixing fact with fiction, while we are shown Photoshopped ad mats and 
    posters displaying the fake films. There's also hilarious testimony 
    from an actor named &quot;Dick Haze&quot; (Mac Welch) who appeared in 
    every one of SSCPI's films and what he has to say is very funny (and 
    also very true!). His deadpan delivery is priceless. As a matter of 
    fact this fake story could be about any real low-budget film company, 
    like Terry Levene's <A HREF="aquarius_releasing_newspaper_ad_mats.htm">Aquarius
     Releasing</A>, American International Pictures, <A HREF="bedford_entertainment_newspaper_ads.htm">Bedford

     Brenner Associates</A>, New World Pictures and dozens of 
    fly-by-night companies (nearly all of them get name-dropped), but the 
    one it fits the closest is Independent International Pictures, who 
    did nearly everything this film describes, such as cashing in on 
    fads, retitling their films so many times that audiences were bound 
    to be fooled more than once, and using a name star to appear in one 
    film, not telling him that the footage shot would appear in dozens of 
    future films and only paying him for one (The &quot;name&quot; star 
    here is &quot;Howard Clinton&quot;, played by Clint Howard!). The 
    cigar-chomping &quot;Stogie&quot; could be Sam Sherman and the story 
    could be IIP's (except for the fire), but then the filmmakers would 
    be sued, wouldn't they? Directors Jason Bailey (who also wrote the 
    screenplay) andMike Hull turn-in a film that hits the nostalgia 
    button for anyone who lived through the late-'60s to early-'80s genre 
    film scene. It will bring back many lost memories of times you went 
    to a grindhouse to see films you knew absolutely nothing about (maybe 
    seeing a deceptive trailer before going if you were lucky) and either 
    being severely disappointed or extremely satisfied. There was nothing 
    like those days and this film gives you a good idea what it was like. 
    I didn't care for the fake trailers, but it's what comes between them 
    that made me very happy. If you didn't experience those times first 
    hand (like I did and, yes, I'm fucking old!), you probably won't 
    understand this film or even like it, but those who have are in for a 
    good time.;<A NAME="EatLocals2017"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want 
    to see my smile turn into a frown, just mention &quot;vampire

     LOCALS</A></B> (2017), a British vampire comedy with a difference. 
    Not only are these special brand of vampires bloodsuckers, they are 
    also cannibals! The film begins with a group of these cannibal 
    vampires meeting at a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere, where we 
    discover that they are highly organized, with &quot;councils&quot; 
    all over the world. Not only that, but they are on strict quotas, 
    only allowed a certain amount of human deaths per year so as not to 
    bring suspicion to their species. When one of their kind begins 
    taking more than he is allowed (they generally kill people that would 
    not usually be missed, like homeless vagabonds, prostitutes and 
    Gypsies!), killing young children to satisfy his hunger (He says, 
    &quot;They are so tender at that age!&quot;), the group kills him 
    with a stake through his heart. They are now looking to introduce 
    another human to their group, <A HREF="eat_locals_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/eat local poster6a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="214" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>turning
     him into one of them, but the vote has to be unanimous. That human 
    would be Sebastian Crockett (Billy Cook) a man who is just returning 
    home from military duty, who was an orphan all his life (Making him a 
    perfect member of this group). Group member Vanessa (Eve Myles; <B><A HREF="torchwood_tv_series_2006-2011.htm">TORCHWOOD</A></B> 
    [2006 - 2011]) has taken a romantic interest in Sebastian, but when 
    another group member, Peter (Tony Curran; <B><A HREF="cat_run_2011.htm">CAT
     RUN</A></B> - 2011), votes &quot;no&quot; in making him the newest 
    member (Sebastian has a way of making people hate him for no reason), 
    the group has to kill Sebastian. He is saved from a certain bloody 
    death when a group of soldiers, led by Larousse (Mackenzie Crook), 
    surround the farmhouse and open up fire (The vampires are 
    cold-blooded and can easily be spotted by using heat-seeking 
    equipment). Long story short, Sebastian ends up saving only three of 
    the vampire group, including Henry (Charlie Cox; Netflix's <B><A HREF="daredevil_netflix_series_2015.htm">DAREDEVIL</A></B> 
    series [2015-2018]), but how he does it and what happens during that 
    time is best seen for yourself. I have to admit that I laughed often 
    and loudly on several occasions, such as when Vanessa is hiding in a 
    chicken coop and a clucking chicken is giving away her location to 
    the soldiers. Vanessa turns around and shows the chicken her true 
    face (it isn't pretty) and the chicken shoots an egg out of its ass 
    in fright! There are many funny and clever moments in this film, 
    including a vampire takeoff of the Steve McQueen motorcycle scene in <B><A HREF="great_escape_1963.htm">THE
     GREAT ESCAPE</A></B> (1963), complete with the film's theme music; 
    an old lady vampire named Alice (Annette Crosbie; <B><A HREF="hawk_the_slayer_1980.htm">HAWK
     THE SLAYER</A></B> - 1980) handling an automatic weapon like a pro 
    (&quot;I have one of these at home&quot;, she says); and the 
    Commanding Officer of the soldiers, Colonel Bingham (Robert Portal), 
    sacrificing his men to capture one of these vampires alive because he 
    is selling their blood to a cosmetics company (We see a commercial at 
    the end of the film where the company touts their new ageless beauty 
    formula, where the side effects are quoted as &quot;The secret 
    protein ingredient could cause sensitivity to sunlight, nausea, 
    uncontrollable aggressive behavior and an insatiable desire for human 
    blood!&quot;). This is the freshman directing debut of actor Jason 
    Flemyng (<B><A HREF="solomon_kane_2009.htm">SOLOMON KANE</A></B> - 
    2009), who does a fantastic job of steering clear of vampire 
    clich&eacute;s, taking the film in many unexpected and surprising 
    directions.&nbsp; All the actors register in their roles, especially 
    Tony Curran and Charlie Cox, who never play their roles with a wink 
    towards the audience, rather portraying their characters as something 
    real and dangerous, as well as making them humanistic, even though 
    they are cannibals and vampires. You'll root for this group, mainly 
    because they are more human and caring than the people who are after 
    them. Billy Cook also registers as Sebastian, a young man who uses 
    humor as a weapon. He gives his role a lot of depth with his very 
    funny dialogue (screenplay by Danny King). All in all, this is a film 
    that should be seen by anyone who is looking to make a horror comedy. 
    This film goes into all the right directions and, while some of the 
    humor is quite outrageous, an equal amount is subtle and knowing, 
    making this film a good bet for horror and comedy fans. Why isn't 
    this film more popular? It deserves to be.;<A NAME="DaveMadeMaze2017"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     I generally stay away from comedies, especially if they win the 
    &quot;Audience Award&quot; at the pretentious Slamdance Film 
    Festival&reg;, which the film <B><A HREF="dave_made_a_maze_2017.htm">DAVE
     MADE A MAZE</A></B> (2017) did, but since so many of my readers 
    recommend I watch the film, I decided to take the hit, but, damn, if 
    I didn't enjoy this film immensely. This is a fantasy comedy with 
    some definite horror overtones, but it's not bloody or very violent. 
    It doesn't need to be. Yes, it can be somewhat dark in tone at times, 
    but that's what I liked about it. The premise is this: Girlfriend 
    Annie (Meera Rohit Kumbhani) returns from a week-long business trip 
    to the apartment she shares with boyfriend Dave (Nick Thune), only to 
    find a cardboard maze in the middle of the living room (made from 
    refrigerator boxes), with the voice of Dave telling her he is trapped 
    inside (He says, &quot;It's bigger than it looks.&quot;). Annie has a 
    hard time believing him, telling Dave to get the hell out of the 
    boxes, but Dave says, he can't, he's lost. He tells Annie to call his 
    best friend Gordon (Adam Busch) and no one else, especially Harry 
    (James Urbaniak, who is excellent), to come over and try to help him 
    escape the maze, but he tells Annie not to come inside because it's 
    too dangerous. Pretty soon the apartment is full of people, including 
    the pretentious Harry, who<A HREF="dave_made_a_maze_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/dave made a maze poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    believes life is nothing but a documentary yet to be filmed, bringing 
    his own cameraman (Scott Narver) and sound guy (Frank Caeti, who 
    holds a boom mike through the entire film!) to record the situation. 
    Also along for the crazy ride is the eternally happy Jane (<B><A HREF="criminal_minds_tv_series.htm">CRIMINAL
     MINDS</A></B>' Kirsten Vangsness), Brynn (Stephanie Allynne), 
    Leonard (Scott Krinsky), Greg (Timothy Nordwind) a Hobo (Rick 
    Overton) and a Flemish tourist couple (Drew Canan &amp; Kamilla 
    Alnes), who made a wrong turn in their tour of the city. Over Dave's 
    objections, everyone decides to enter the maze and none of their 
    lives will ever be the same again. Yes, the maze is much bigger on 
    the inside than it is on the outside (reminding me of Doctor Who's 
    TARDIS) and it's a thing of beauty. There are many rooms in this 
    maze, each room having a theme and each room being more dangerous 
    than the last one (there's one that looks like a giant vagina that 
    will make you do a doubletake!). The first one to die is Jane, who is 
    decapitated by a cardboard pendulum, but instead of blood flowing out 
    of her neck hole it's red confetti and streamers! (It's quite funny 
    and ingenious). Everyone is also being chased by a Minotaur, a 
    creature with a body built like a brick shithouse (portrayed by 
    wrestler John Hennigan (<B><A HREF="#BooneBounty2016">BOONE: THE 
    BOUNTY HUNTER</A></B> - 2016) and the cardboard head of a Minotaur! 
    The rest of the film deals with this group trying to find Dave, 
    avoiding the Minotaur, escaping the dangers each room holds 
    (basically they begin to die one-by-one) and finding a way out of the 
    maze. I noticed a lot of homages to other films, including the trash 
    compactor scene in <B><A HREF="star_wars_1977.htm">STAR WARS</A></B>&nbsp;
     (1977), some nods to <B><A HREF="2001_a_space_odyssey_1968.htm">2001:
     A SPACE ODYSSEY</A></B> (1968) and other tips of the hat to many 
    other films. This isn't a laugh-a-minute comedy because some scenes 
    are quite dark, bordering on deadly, but I did laugh out loud quite a 
    bit when the group turns into cardboard puppets (the boom guy and 
    cameraman puppets are standouts in this scene) and when Brynn turns 
    into a cardboard creature (looking like the Cowardly Lion in <B><A HREF="wizard_of_oz.htm">THE
     WIZARD OF OZ</A></B> - 1939), who only says one thing, &quot;High 
    Five!&quot; over and over until it turns into something surreal and 
    quite frightening (you'll have to see for yourself to know what I 
    mean, but here's <A HREF="dave_made_a_maze_2017.htm#HighFive!">a hint</A>).
     This film is a wonder to look at, as the set direction is a thing of 
    beauty (everything is made out of cardboard) and 
    director/co-screenwriter (with Steven Sears) Bill Watterson has 
    turned in a very entertaining low-budget fantasy full of good acting 
    and absurd situations. This is the reason why I trust my readers! 
    Available streaming on Amazon Prime and other streaming sites at the 
    time of this review. This is something you should not miss. It's a 
    childhood nightmare come to life (who didn't make forts out of 
    cardboard boxes when they were kids?).;<A NAME="TerrorHallowsEve17"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     A few people pointed me to <B><A HREF="terror_of_hallows_eve_2017.htm">THE
     TERROR OF HALLOW'S EVE</A></B> (2017) and while this horror film 
    doesn't work on all levels, I still enjoyed the hell out of it, if 
    only for the acting talents of Caleb Thomas and the eerie performance 
    of Doug Jones as &quot;<A HREF="terror_of_hallows_eve_2017.htm#Trickster">The
     Trickster</A>&quot;. The film opens on Halloween Day in 1981, where 
    latchkey teen Timothy Stevens (Caleb Thomas, who is outstanding) 
    spends his time scaring people, this time teenage Stephanie (Christie 
    Nicole Chaplin). As she is walking home from school, she notices a 
    blood trail on the sidewalk, so she follows it and finds Timothy 
    (Don't you dare call him Timmy, because he hates that!) behind some 
    garbage cans, his chest ripped open and his ribcage showing. Blood 
    spurts on Stephanie's face and clothes, bringing out the ire of her 
    father Ed (Eric Roberts in a two minute cameo), who grabs Timothy and 
    knocks on the door of his house. Timothy's mother, Linda (Sarah 
    Lancaster; <B><A HREF="lovers_lane_2000.htm">LOVER'S LANE</A></B> - 
    2000), answers the door and tells Ed to let go of Timothy before she 
    calls the police. Ed says this is the last time Timothy performs one 
    of these bloody tricks on his daughter, saying if he does it again, 
    he will call the police. We then find out that Timothy's father, 
    Bobby (Christian Kane; <B><A HREF="donner_party_2009.htm">THE DONNER PARTY</A></B> 
    - 2009), deserted his family when Timothy was a young boy. Bobby was 
    a drunk and a cocaine addict who blamed Timothy for his unhappiness, 
    so he left one night, never to return. Linda has to work the night 
    shift at a hospital to support <A HREF="terror_of_hallows_eve_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/terror of hallow's eve dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Timothy,
     as Bobby cannot be located to pay child support and Linda is barely 
    making ends meet. Timothy still idolizes his father, not realizing 
    what a bastard he was (he use to physically abuse Linda) and 
    fantasizes him returning home. Timothy is also a horror film freak 
    (his bedroom is full of horror posters and memorabilia), who goes 
    with his mother to the local convenience store to pick up groceries 
    (and a monster magazine), where he discovers his childhood crush, 
    April (Annie Read), is working the register. Timothy again fantasizes 
    that April wants him for a lover, but reality hits when April's 
    bastard boyfriend, Brian (JT Neal), enters the store and kisses April 
    (after he steals a candy bar off the counter). This is the beginning 
    of Timothy's nightmare, as he accidentally chips the paint on Brian's 
    car and he gets beaten up by Brian and his two stoner pals, Spaz 
    (Mcabe Gregg) and Chuck (Niko Papastefanou). A battered, bruised and 
    bloody Timothy runs home, but finds a strange pumpkin on his way 
    there and brings it home, carves it and says he wishes he could get 
    even with Brian and his friends (&quot;I'd like to frighten them to 
    death!&quot;).&nbsp; Then The Trixter (Doug Jones; <B><A HREF="shape_of_water_2017.htm">THE
     SHAPE OF WATER</A></B> - 2017) appears and tells Timothy that his 
    wish will come true, but only if he does what he says. Timothy 
    agrees, so he goes back to the convenience store and breaks a door 
    window on Brian's car. Brian, April (who doesn't want to go), Spaz 
    and Chuck chase Timothy back to his house, which is now pure 
    nightmare fuel. Every room in the house is a room of horrors. Chuck 
    enters a room and finds himself in the middle of the woods, where a 
    creature named &quot;Scarecrow&quot; (also Doug Jones; <B><A HREF="raze_2013.htm">RAZE</A></B> 
    - 2013) chases Chuck, cuts his stomach open with a knife and begins 
    eating Chuck's intestines while he is still alive. Spaz enters 
    another room and finds himself in a room full of living marionettes, 
    who cut their strings, attack Spaz and stab him to death with knives. 
    I'll leave it up to you to discover what happens to Brian, but is 
    April also going to be one of The Trickster's victims? If you want to 
    know the answer, you are going to have to watch the film, which only 
    runs a quick 80 minutes. Let's just say it will be a lot of people's 
    last Halloween among the living. Director Todd Tucker, working with a 
    screenplay written by actor Zack Ward (<B><A HREF="dont_blink_2014.htm">DON'T
     BLINK</A></B> - 2014; who makes a brief cameo appearance on 
    Timothy's television), fills this film with a lot of atmosphere, but 
    some of the scenes are very dark, so you will have to do some 
    squinting. That's my biggest complaint about this film, but it is not 
    that much of a problem to not recommend this film to all horror film 
    lovers out there. Since Todd Tucker is a special effects makeup 
    artist by trade (supplying FX makeup effects to such films as <B><A HREF="pit_and_the_pendulum_1991.htm">THE
     PIT AND THE PENDULUM</A></B> - 1991; <B><A HREF="darkness_falls_2003.htm">DARKNESS
     FALLS</A></B> - 2003; and <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#TrailerParkOfTerror">TRAILER
     PARK OF TERROR</A></B> - 2008), most of the effects are CGI-free and 
    practical (and amazingly original). Doug Jones kills it as The 
    Trickster and every scene he is in will raise goosebumps on your arms 
    and make the hairs on your neck stand up in fright. For a low-budget 
    effort, this is surprisingly well acted and it gets my highest 
    recommendation. Not everything works here, but when it does, it does 
    it very well. It's September of 2020 as I write this review and Todd 
    Tucker has yet to direct another film. I'll just say this: If and 
    when he does, it will be a high priority for me to watch it. Look for 
    character actor supreme Peter Jason (<B><A HREF="prince_of_darkness_1987.htm">PRINCE
     OF DARKNESS</A></B> - 1987) in a cameo role at the end of the film.</FONT></FONT></P>

     DTV Genre Films Part 23<A NAME="Good2018"></A> (continued):<A NAME="Hereditary2018"></A> 
    One of the best horror films of 2018 is <B><A HREF="hereditary_2018.htm">HEREDITARY</A></B>,
     a nearly indescribable mash-up of supernatural horror and family 
    drama. It also contains some of the most brutal deaths I have seen in 
    a modern-day horror film, five-star performances from everyone in the 
    cast, some weird photography tricks that had me rewinding the film to 
    make sure I saw it correctly, as well as the ugliest child actress I 
    have ever laid eyes on! The film begins with the funeral of the 
    estranged mother of Annie Graham (an exceptional Toni Collette; <B><A HREF="sixth_sense_1999.htm">THE
     SIXTH SENSE</A></B> - 1999), where Annie's entire family, which 
    includes husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne; <B><A HREF="end_of_days_1999.htm">END
     OF DAYS</A></B> - 1999), teenage son Peter (a fantastic Alex Wolff; <B><A HREF="my_friend_dahmer_2017.htm">MY
     FRIEND DAHMER</A></B> - 2017) and not-quite-right young daughter 
    Charlie (Newcomer Millie Shapiro, who is, to put it simply, hard on 
    the eyes. What's up with her nose???), mourn the passing of Annie's 
    mother, each in their own unusual way. It's quite obvious that Annie 
    doesn't love son Peter as much as she does Charlie (it's explained 
    why in an incredibly hurtful line of dialogue spoken by Annie), but 
    there's something much worse on the<A HREF="hereditary_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/hereditary spain poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    horizon. Is it possible that Annie's mother was a witch and she has 
    plans for Peter, even though she's dead? Annie makes a living by 
    creating realistic miniature dioramas, which she fashions down to the 
    most minute of details (check out the opening of the film to see how 
    realistic her dioramas are), which she then displays and sells at at 
    art galleries, She spends more time on them than with her children 
    and we can see it affects them greatly. Peter wants to go to a party 
    with his friends, but Mom makes him take Charlie along. He leaves 
    Charlie alone at the party while he goes off to smoke some pot with a 
    girl he likes, but when Charlie has a piece of chocolate cake, she 
    has some type of allergic reaction and cannot catch her breath. Peter 
    puts her in the car and races to the hospital, but before he gets 
    there, he nearly hits a dog laying in the middle of the road and is 
    forced to swerve off the road, the same time Charlie has her head out 
    the window trying to catch her breath. In an unbelievably brutal 
    scene, Charlie is decapitated at the jawline when her head is smashed 
    against a telephone pole (!). So what does Peter do? Well, he simply 
    drives home and goes to bed (he's in a state of shock). The next 
    morning, we hear Annie scream when she discovers her daughter's 
    headless body in the car. The fact is that we never see her do it, as 
    the scene is played specifically on Peter's face when his mother's 
    screams wake him up, is one of the film's most telling scenes. This 
    film is full of these kind of scenes, which makes it all the more 
    remarkable. While the acting is way above average, it's the direction 
    and photography that got my attention. Directed with a sense of 
    urgency by Ari Aster, whose only other directorial credits are a 
    handful of short films, this is unlike any horror film that came 
    before it and is bound to spawn a bunch of imitators, which couldn't 
    possibly match this film's sense of style. Let me talk about this 
    film's style for a minute: The photography (by Pawel Pogorzelski) 
    plays with light the like I have never seen before, so much so, that 
    I found myself stopping the film, rewinding it and making sure I saw 
    what I saw. Every time there is a trick of the light, something awful 
    and violent happens. The entire film is like living an alternate life 
    in a dream. I really didn't know what to expect, but I found myself 
    jumping out of my seat more than a couple of times. Movies never do 
    that to me, but this one did. That's a testament to this film's 
    effectiveness. I've only revealed 10% of what happens in this film, 
    so be prepared for some major shocks and chills. Let me end this 
    review with this: <B><A HREF="hereditary_2018b.htm">HEREDITARY</A></B> 
    is my favorite new film of 2018 and that includes all genres, not 
    just horror. It's guaranteed to put you in a hypnotic trance and 
    plays with your emotions like no other film that came before it. I 
    can't wait to see what Ari Aster does next! A big thumbs-up to 
    everyone involved with this film, from cast to crew.&nbsp; The film 
    runs 127 minutes, but it never seems overlong. And, oh, that ending 
    (it's bound to piss off a lot of people, but I found it apt and 
    eerie). If you think modern horror films are spineless and 
    ineffective, may I recommend this film to you? To say I am looking 
    forward to Ari Aster's next film, <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Midsommar2019">MIDSOMMAR</A></B> 
    (2019), is a vast understatement.;<A NAME="StrangeNature2018"></A> <B><A HREF="strange_nature_2018.htm">STRANGE
     NATURE</A></B> (2018) may be a Kickstarter-funded film, but don't 
    let that fool you, it's an inventive and well-acted flick with much 
    to recommend. The story is fairly simple: Former pop star Kim Sweet 
    (Lisa Sheridan; star of the late, lamented TV Series <B><A HREF="freakylinks_tv_series_2000-2001.htm">FREAKYLINKS</A></B> 
    [2000-2001]) and her young son Brody (Jonah Beres) move back to 
    Duluth, Minnesota from L.A. to take care of her father, Chuck (Bruce 
    Bohne; <B><A HREF="dawn_of_the_dead_2004.htm">DAWN OF THE DEAD</A></B> 
    - 2004; in a winning performance), who is dying of liver cancer. 
    Years ago, when Kim was famous, she bad-mouthed the town of Duluth 
    and they have never forgiven her, especially when they find out she 
    pulled a Milli Vanilli (She had the look, but not the voice, so the 
    record label went along with the ruse until she was found out). Kim 
    tries to get Duluth's Mayor Paulson (Stephen Tobolowsky; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Keep Grave Open">KEEP
     MY GRAVE OPEN</A></B> - 1977) to do something about the rash of 
    mutated frogs in the area, believing it has something to do with the 
    pesticides that farms are using, but nearly everyone in town believe 
    that Kim just wants to get famous again and is using the frogs as an 
    excuse to do so. That couldn't be further from the <A HREF="strange_nature_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/strange nature poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>truth.
     The company providing the pesticides is an important company to this 
    slowly dying town, so people of importance don't want to rock the 
    boat, including the Mayor, but when Chuck's dog has a litter of 
    mutated puppies and pregnant women in town begin delivering mutated 
    babies and begin dying, it can no longer be overlooked. Kim begins a 
    romance with Brody's grade school science teacher Greg (voice-over 
    artist Carlos Alazraqui) and he helps her expose the company 
    providing the pesticide. That's the gist of the story, but there is 
    so much more, including a severely deformed man named Joseph (David 
    Mattey; also this film's editor and supplied the digital video 
    effects. He was also the stunt coordinator.) and his equally deformed 
    daughter Michelle (Chalet Lizette Brannan; <B><A HREF="#ClownMotel2018">CLOWN
     MOTEL</A></B> - 2018) whom Brody makes friends with, saving their 
    lives when the town bigots blame Joseph and his daughter for 
    spreading the &quot;disease&quot; in this town, believing he is the 
    one putting something in the water to get even with the town (Joseph 
    moved to Duluth from New Jersey. Why does Jersey always get blamed?). 
    A series of young people have gone missing in town and the police 
    think that kidnappings are involved, but we can see there is some 
    sort of mutated creature that is at fault for their deaths. As you 
    would expect, everything comes to a head, when Chuck dies and Kim 
    discovers that she is pregnant with Greg's baby, but will she get an 
    abortion before she is due to deliver? Half the fun of getting to the 
    answers is the trip director/screenwriter James Ojala (His first full 
    length feature, who is normally a special effects makeup artist; he 
    supplied this film's makeup effects and they are magnificent) takes 
    us on. There's rarely a false note to be had, as the story is based 
    on fact (mutated frogs are a sign of something deadly that would 
    affect all life on this planet and there are real stories about this 
    happening now). Everyone turns in spot-on performances and there are 
    many funny moments, as there are frightening ones. My girl Tiffany 
    Shepis (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HomeSick2007">HOME SICK</A></B> 
    - 2007) puts in a cameo as a photographer who gets killed in the 
    beginning of the film by the unknown mutated creature (it is revealed 
    in the finale and, boy, is it worth the wait!) and there is a 
    surprising humanity to the entire film (especially Chuck's death). 
    Even the people we think are the bad guys suddenly realize that they 
    are fighting a losing battle (The Mayor is one of them, but of course 
    he makes it look like he had it all under control). And yes, we do 
    see Kim's baby in the finale, but it is best that I don't tell you 
    what happens. There's also a hilarious scene where Chuck and Kim talk 
    to one of their neighbors and discover that he belongs to a 
    &quot;Furry&quot; cult (once again, it is best if you discover it for 
    yourself) and make sure you stay until after the end credits for 
    another funny sting. This could be my favorite low-budget<A HREF="possum_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/possum poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="215" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    horror film of 2018. Seriously, you should see it now if you can. It 
    is available streaming for free on Amazon Prime.;<A NAME="Possum2018"></A> <B><A HREF="possum_2018.htm">POSSUM</A></B> 
    (2018) is a British horror film that is pure nightmare fuel. The 
    story, about a man named Philip (a terrifying Sean Harris; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Creep2004">CREEP</A></B> 
    - 2004) and his best undescribed puppet (once seen, never forgotten) 
    that he keeps in a brown leather bag, is upsetting enough, but his 
    relationship with his creepy Uncle Maurice (an even more terrifying 
    Alun Armstrong; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#SplitSecond1992">SPLIT
     SECOND</A></B> - 1992) will send chills up your spine, as Maurice 
    only talks in two or three word sentences, yet Philip understands 
    completely what he is talking about (even if we don't, but it all 
    becomes clear later in the film). Director/screenwriter Matthew 
    Holness (his first full-length feature as a director; he was 
    writer/creator/actor on the cult limited six-episode British TV 
    series <B><A HREF="garth_marenghis_darkplace_2004.htm">GARTH 
    MARENGHI'S DARKPLACE</A></B> - 2004) keeps the viewer very off-center 
    (the music, by &quot;The Radiophonic Workshop&quot;, will 
    particularly put you on edge), as the film just reeks of mold and 
    rot, especially the house that Philip and Maurice live in. The house 
    is so filthy (look at the walls), you can actually smell the mold. 
    The core of the story takes its time to reveal itself, but you won't 
    mind because the film is ugly to look at, yet you won't be able to 
    take your eyes off the screen (even the outdoor scenes look drained 
    of color; this is no camera trick, as Holness purposely found the 
    most decrepit areas to film in). The original &quot;Possum&quot; 
    nursery rhyme that Philip created as a boy will haunt your memory for 
    years to come (Just like in <B><A HREF="babadook_2013.htm">BABADOOK</A></B> 
    [2013], I wish I could get my hands on the book Philip made as a 
    child, which contains the entire horrific nursery rhyme complete with 
    original drawings). There is also one of the best jump scares I ever 
    witnessed in a horror film towards the end of the movie (Believe me, 
    you'll know when it happens! I think my heart skipped a couple of 
    beats.). This is a film you won't soon forget, even after it is all 
    over. I love how it throws you a left every time you're expecting a 
    right. It will linger in your brain fo</FONT>r <FONT SIZE="2">quite 
    some time, even infecting your dreams (It did mine!). Films like this 
    don't come around too often, so see this one ASAP. If I say any more 
    about this film, it will deprive you of a totally original horror 
    film that is rare in this day and age, so discover and enjoy it for 
    yourself. It's available streaming on Amazon Prime, free to Prime 
    members. If you aren't a Prime member, what are you waiting for?;<A NAME="BloodFest2018"></A> 
    I have to say that I enjoyed director/screenwriter/actor Owen 
    Egerton's <B><A HREF="blood_fest_2018.htm">BLOOD FEST</A></B> (2018), 
    even though some fans of horror movies may find it disrespectful and 
    cow-tows to them. All I can say is ignore those slams and enjoy the 
    film for what it is, a pretty funny gore flick. The story is quite 
    simple, yet it contains numerous tropes from horror films of the '70s 
    &amp; '80s, but those tropes are needed to advance the plot. When Dax 
    (Robbie Kay; <B><A HREF="hannibal_rising_2007.htm">HANNIBAL RISING</A></B> 
    - 2007) was a young boy, he saw one of the psychiatric patients of 
    his psychiatrist father, (Tate Donovan; <B><A HREF="swordfish_2001.htm">SWORDFISH</A></B> 
    - 2001) kill his mother in their home (they were watching Bela 
    Lugosi's <B><A HREF="white_zombie_1932.htm">WHITE ZOMBIE</A></B> 
    [1932] on TV). Dax's mother was a fan of horror movies and passed 
    that love on to Dax. Now a teenager, Dax can't wait to go to Blood 
    Fest, a festival of horror and nothing but horror, overseen by 
    world-famous horror movie director Anthony Walsh (Egerton), who has 
    placed many horror film genre references (and cliches) on a 700 acre 
    plot of land. Dax's father refuses to let his son go to the festival, 
    telling him it was his mother's fault she was murdered and horror 
    films are what causes violence in society (yeah, that old wives 
    tale), so he takes Dax's ticket to Blood Fest and tears it up (yet 
    Daddy had no problem shooting his patient in front of Dax when he was 
    just a toddler! A little contradictory, no?). The tickets are nearly 
    impossible to get without paying ridiculous scalpers prices on eBay 
    and Craigslist. Dax's female friend Sam (Seychelle Gabriel; <A HREF="spirit_2008.htm"><B>THE
     SPIRIT</B></A> - 2008) and best friend Krill (Jacob Batalon; <B><A HREF="avengers_endgame_2019.htm">AVENGERS:
     ENDGAME</A></B> - 2019) tell Dax to get a ticket from his ditsy 
    friend Ashley (Barbara Dunkelman), who believes she is a serious 
    actress, even though her best role was &quot;Topless Girl #4&quot; in 
    a cheap horror flick (Dax says this about Ashley: &quot;She thought <B><A HREF="black_christmas_1974.htm">BLACK
     CHRISTMAS</A></B> was a Tyler Perry movie!&quot;). Long story short, 
    it turns out that Anthony Walsh is using all the attendees at the 
    festival as real victims, which he is filming for his ultimate horror 
    film. Dax, along with Sam, Ashley, Krill and a couple of &quot;red 
    shirts&quot; must use their knowledge of horror film tropes to make 
    it out of Blood Fest alive, but seven hundred acres is a pretty long 
    way on foot, especially when Walsh&nbsp; has the land sectioned off 
    with various horror types, such as zombies, killer clowns, possessed 
    dolls, vampires, werewolves and other horror film &quot;tropes&quot; 
    (that word is used a lot in this film!). There are a few bloody 
    surprises along the way, but it is best if you discover them on your 
    own, because if I spill the beans, I would ruin the film for you. 
    This is an extremely gory film, full of gushing blood and other 
    gruesome deaths (some of them done in CGI, which knocks this film 
    down a couple of pegs for me). But, even though this film has 
    problems, especially when Walsh tells his workers how he managed to 
    get actual zombies and vampires to kill the fans, this is an 
    extremely enjoyable horror film, with many surprises and comedy 
    moments that are actually funny, something that is very hard to do in 
    horror films. The acting is good across the board, especially by 
    Jacob Batalon as the virginal Krill. We also get many chainsaw 
    deaths, impalements, decapitations, drawn and quartering and other 
    methods of death, making this film an enjoyable experience for horror 
    film fanatics, where titles of past horror flicks are bandied about 
    like they are part of their lexicon and, unlike many other horror 
    comedies, it works here. So sit back, relax and take in a film that 
    pays respect to horror film fans, something that is very hard to do. 
    I am not a fan of many horror comedies, but the acting and writing 
    here won me over and it should do the same thing for you. There are 
    many other surprising moments in this film for you to discover. I am 
    purposely keeping everything vague so you can experience them on your 
    own. You can thank me later.;<A NAME="Halloween2018"></A> <B><A HREF="halloween_2018.htm">HALLOWEEN</A></B> 
    (2018) is a very tense sequel to the original <B><A HREF="halloween_1978.htm">HALLOWEEN</A></B> 
    (1978), which totally ignores <A HREF="halloween_1978_celebrating_40+_years_of_michael_myers.htm">all
     the sequels</A> (Including Rob Zombie's <A HREF="halloween_2007.htm">two</A> <A HREF="halloween_2_2009.htm">flicks</A>)
     in the plot, but pays tribute to them in visuals and dialogue. The 
    first aspect of this film that I completely loved is that the rumor 
    that Laurie Strode was Michael Myers' sister is shot down in some 
    very sly bits of dialogue. John Carpenter (who Executive Produced and 
    supplied music for this film, as well as getting&nbsp; a &quot;Based 
    On Characters Created By&quot; credit [along with the late Debra 
    Hill]) has gone on record stating that he wrote <B><A HREF="halloween_2_1981.htm">HALLOWEEN
     II</A></B> (1981) for the money and regretted making Laurie 
    Michael's sister in that film, so in this film the record is set 
    straight. If I do have problems with this film, it's that Jamie Lee 
    Curtis is made up to look very old, wearing the most ridiculous wig, 
    making her look like a crazy cat lady. Ms. Curtis is actually a very 
    beautiful woman, but she kicks ass in this film, so I can overlook 
    director <A HREF="halloween_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/halloween 2018 poster18a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>David
     Gordon Green (<B><A HREF="pineapple_express_2008.htm">PINEAPPLE EXPRESS</A></B> 
    - 2008) wanting Laurie to look like she suffered a life of hell. 
    Another thing that bothered me is that 80% of the killings are shown 
    after the fact, yet the visuals are quite graphic (i.e. A cop with a 
    cut throat holding a flashlight that is shoved up the severed head of 
    his partner, making it look like some twisted jack-o-lantern; a gas 
    store clerk with his jaw separated from his skull; Michael even kills 
    a young child in this film, a first for him). In this film, a 
    61-year-old Michael Myers (James Jude Courtney; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#FreewayManiac">THE
     FREEWAY MANIAC</A></B> - 1987) has been locked away in an insane 
    asylum for 40 years, looked after by Dr. Sartain (Haluk Bilginer) 
    ever since the death of Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence, who does not 
    appear in this film since he died decades ago, but Loomis' name gets 
    dropped quite often). Dr. Sartain is a strange man, who insists on 
    riding the bus when Michael and a bunch of other crazies are being 
    transported to a state asylum. As you can guess, the bus has an 
    accident and Michael is on the loose in Haddonfield, exactly 40 years 
    after his last killing spree, on Halloween Night (how he is reunited 
    with his trademark William Shatner rubber mask is quite ingenious). 
    Dr. Sartain, along with Officer Hawkins (Will Patton; the TV Series <B><A HREF="falling_skies_tv_series_2011.htm">FALLING
     SKIES</A></B> - 2011-2015), try to hunt Michael down, Officer 
    Hawkins looking to kill him (he supposedly stopped Dr. Loomis from 
    killing him in the original film) and Dr. Sartain having other 
    reasons for finding him (It looks like Michael's evil spread to him. 
    His death is particularly juicy!). Laurie's married daughter, Karen 
    (Judy Greer; <B><A HREF="carrie_2013.htm">CARRIE</A></B> - 2013), who 
    was taken away from Laurie by Child Protective Services when she was 
    12-years-old, and granddaughter Allyson (newcomer Andi Matichak) live 
    in Haddonfield, as does Laurie (she's estranged from her daughter, 
    but not her granddaughter), who resides in a fortress-like house, 
    complete with high-tech security, secret rooms, boobie traps and a 
    shooting range full of creepy mannequins riddled with bullet holes. 
    Laurie has waited 40 years for Michael to return (she's a crack shot 
    with any weapon, as is Karen) and she's prepared for him, as you will 
    see when you watch the film. The real star of this film is Laurie's 
    house, which is full of surprises and deadly traps, made just for 
    Michael. There are many unique tributes to the sequels in this film, 
    especially the &quot;Silver Shamrock&quot; masks from <B><A HREF="halloween_3_season_of_the_witch_1982.htm">HALLOWEEN
     III</A></B> (1982) the kids wear on the streets on Halloween Night. 
    See if you can spot the other homages, some quite obvious and others 
    hidden, especially in the dialogue. This film pays proper respect to 
    the original film, thanks to comic actor Danny McBride's dead-serious 
    screenplay, which he co-wrote with Jeff Fradley and director Green. 
    McBride and Green are long-time collaborators who worked together on 
    many projects, such as the HBO series <B><A HREF="eastbound_and_down_2010-2013.htm">EASTBOUND
     &amp; DOWN</A></B> (2010 - 2013). This is one sequel that is worth 
    your time. Will there be a sequel to this sequel? All I will say is 
    stay through the entire closing credits for some special audio hints. 
    Look for the original film's P.J. Soles in a cameo as a teacher. Nick 
    Castle also returns to portray &quot;The Shape&quot; in some scenes. 
    Co-Produced by Malek Akkad, this film is dedicated to his father, 
    Moustapha Akkad, who Executive Produced the original and all the 
    sequels. He was killed in the terrorist bombing in Amman, Jordan on 
    November 09, 2005.;<A NAME="Suspiria2018"></A> <B><A HREF="suspiria_2018.htm">SUSPIRIA</A></B> 
    (2018) is a really divisive film, one you are going to either love or 
    hate, there is no middle ground (check out the user reviews on IMDb 
    to see what I mean). I happen to love it, if only for Tilda Swinton (<B><A HREF="snowpiercer_2013.htm">SNOWPIERCER</A></B> 
    - 2013), who portrays three roles, one of them being a man! While not 
    really a remake of Dario Argento's <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Suspiria1977">SUSPIRIA</A></B> 
    (1977), it is more like a visually trippy reimagining of the basic 
    plot. It still concerns a fish-out-of-water young American dancer, 
    Susie (portrayed here by the excellent Dakota Johnson; <B><A HREF="beastly_2011.htm">BEASTLY</A></B> 
    - 2011), who, in the mid-'70s, comes to a mysterious Markos Tanz 
    Dance Company in Berlin, Germany (during the infamous &quot;German 
    Autumn&quot;; Google it) to be tutored by the prestigious Madame 
    Blanc (Swinton), only to find out she is being conditioned into 
    becoming something far more mysterious; as a member of the academy's 
    deadly witches coven. A former student,<A HREF="suspiria_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/suspiria 2018 poster1e small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="139" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    Patricia (Chlo&euml; Grace Moretz; <B><A HREF="carrie_2013.htm">CARRIE</A></B> 
    - 2013), was supposed to be the new member, but she told her secrets 
    to her psychologist, Dr. Klemperer (also Swinton, here billed under 
    the phony name &quot;Lutz Ebersdorf&quot;. A lot of critics complain 
    about the makeup effects, but the people in the audience with me when 
    I saw it in a theater had no idea it was Tilda Swinton or not a man 
    at all! I concur.), and ends up missing. Dr. Klemperer is obligated 
    to find out what happened to his patient, based on a diary Patricia 
    left at his office, but what he discovers will scar him for the rest 
    of his life. Filled with scenes of extreme brutality and beauty 
    (sometimes at the same time), including Susie's introduction to a 
    deadly dance that contorts and kills another dancer (it must be seen 
    to be appreciated), this film's visuals are not easily forgotten once 
    viewed. Director Luca Guadagnino, like Argento, bathes his film in 
    primary colors, the predominate color being red. Visually, this film 
    is second to none, but that's not what critics complained about. They 
    were more concerned with plot, something I didn't have a problem 
    with. If you just go along with the film's visual beauty, you 
    shouldn't have a problem with the film, either, but you should be 
    prepared for some extreme bloodletting, especially when &quot;Mater 
    Suspiriorum&quot; (&quot;The Mother Of Sighs&quot;), a.k.a. Helena 
    Markos (Swinton again), puts in an appearance, something you won't be 
    able to get out of your head for years to come. What she does towards 
    the end of the film is one of the goriest sequences ever in an 
    R-Rated film and that's saying a lot. The film also ends with a very 
    touching sequence, unusual for a film such as this. Jessica Harper, 
    who appeared in the original film as Suzy (it's just spelled 
    differently in this film), puts in an appearance here as the missing 
    wife of Dr. Klemperer, in a scene full of emotion and pathos. I 
    really don't know what all the naysayers are complaining about. Maybe 
    it is because Luca Guadagnino was remaking a beloved classic or maybe 
    they didn't watch it at all, but there's one thing I do know: It is 
    an unforgettable film, worthy of the original, with many differences 
    to stand on its own (There'a a WTF?!? scene where the witches laugh 
    and play with a police officer's penis!). Yes, it is over two and a 
    half hours long, but it is the quickest 152 minutes you will ever sit 
    through. This film gets my highest recommendation! See it! You can 
    watch it for free streaming if you are an Amazon Prime member (Amazon 
    financed and released the film, but only to select limited theaters 
    late in 2018, before releasing in on disc and their streaming service 
    early in 2019. I was lucky enough to be invited to a sneak preview 
    and the audience applauded when the film ended), but I had to buy the Blu-Ray,
     because I wanted it to be a permanent part of my film library. Also

    choreography in this film is so unusual, it's hypnotic.;<A NAME="Overlord2018"></A> 
    When I heard J.J. Abrams and his Bad Robot Production outfit were 
    making a World War II horror film titled <B><A HREF="overlord_2018.htm">OVERLORD</A></B> 
    (2018), all I could think about is it being another chapter of his <B><A HREF="cloverfield_2007.htm">CLOVERFIELD</A></B> 
    franchise, which I really don't care for in the least. Thankfully, 
    Abrams assured us it wasn't a <B><A HREF="10_cloverfield_lane_2016.htm">CLOVERFIELD</A></B>-related
     film, but that didn't stop most Internet trolls claiming that it 
    was. After watching the film for myself, I can honestly declare that 
    it has no relationship to that franchise at all, not even in the 
    smallest of details (Yet I have read some reviews from 
    &quot;critics&quot; trying to painfully point it to the franchise, 
    giving ridiculous reasons why it is part of that &quot;universe&quot; 
    and it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, as they don't want to 
    backtrack from their original statements that it is a <B><A HREF="cloverfield_paradox_2018.htm">CLOVERFIELD</A></B> 
    film. Just admit you were wrong, no one will think worse of you [I 
    mean, how could they?]). This is actually a very well-made film, full 
    of characters we begin to care about, some great action and 
    explosions, plenty of violence and most of all, some outstanding 
    bloody gore. A group of American paratroopers are sent into 
    Nazi-occupied France to destroy a radio tower atop a fortified church 
    in a small French village. D-Day is to happen in just a few hours, so 
    the radio tower must be destroyed before it begins, so the Nazi's 
    can't contact home base for extra troops. Almost from the start, the 
    mission turns out badly, as the plane they are in is bombarded with 
    shells, forcing the paratroopers to jump out of the plane before it 
    explodes. We see most of the film through the eyes of a green 
    paratrooper named Boyce (an excellent Jovan Adepo), as he parachutes 
    into Nazi-occupied territory and witnesses some German soldiers 
    executing one of his friends just after he lands. He is about to kill 
    the soldiers when he is stopped by his commanding officer Ford (Wyatt 
    Russell), who tells him to focus on the mission, not his friend's 
    death. The tower must be destroyed in just a few hours. They find two 
    other survivors of the parachute jump, Tibbet (John Magaro; my 
    favorite character in the film) and Chase (Iain De Caestecker) and 
    silently make their way to the small French village. On the <A HREF="overlord_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/overlord 2018 poster6a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="171" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>way,
     they run into a pretty young French girl named Chloe (Mathilde 
    Ollivier), who lives in the village and hides them from the Nazis, 
    who are swarming all over the village. To make a long story short, 
    there is much more going on in the church than just the radio tower. 
    A Nazi scientist, Dr. Schmidt (Erich Redman), has invented a serum 
    which can revive the dead. His aim is to create the perfect soldier, 
    one that is unable to die (again), so Germany will win the war. 
    Unfortunately, his formula has serious side effects. The dead 
    injected with the serum turn into deformed monsters and they kill 
    anyone they come in contact with. Not quite the perfect soldier, if 
    they kill members of your own military! Boyce infiltrates the 
    well-guarded church and finds another member of his paratrooper team, 
    Rosenfeld (Dominic Applewhite), still alive and connected to some 
    strange device. Boyce rescues him (after removing the device from his 
    body, an act that will make you squirm), steals a hypo full of the 
    serum and brings them back to Chloe's house, where he tells Ford what 
    is actually going on at the church. Ford once again tells Boyce to 
    focus on the mission, but he finds it hard to do when honest 
    villagers, such as Chloe's Aunt (who lives in a room in the house, 
    but we never see her, only hearing her belabored, monstrous 
    breathing), are being experimented on by Dr. Schmidt. Complicating 
    matters is evil Nazi officer Wafner (Pilou Asb&aelig;k, in a 
    performance that will make you stand up and take notice), who stops 
    by Chloe's house ever so often to rape her! When the paratroopers see 
    Wafner putting the moves on Chloe, even Ford cannot take it, so he 
    knocks out Wafner and takes him prisoner. After learning what is 
    really going on at the church, Ford still wants to blow up the radio 
    tower, but he also now wants to blow up Dr. Schmidt's laboratory and 
    end this madness. Wafner manages to escape after he gets his hands on 
    a pistol and shoots Chase in the head. He takes Chloe's young brother 
    (who has taking a liking to Tibbet) and heads to the church, but not 
    before Ford shoots him in the face. This now turns into a rescue 
    mission as well as their regular mission, as they must rescue Chloe's 
    brother and blow up the laboratory and radio tower. And it's only 20 
    minutes to D-Day! Can they pull it off? And what happens to Wafner 
    when he decides to <A HREF="overlord_2018.htm#BulletFacePhoto">inject 
    himself with the serum</A>, since it has never been tested on a 
    living body before? You'll have to watch the film to find out, but I 
    guarantee you have never seen anything quite like it before. This is 
    a remarkably affecting film, full of interesting characters we become 
    invested in. Some will live and some will die, but you'll never 
    forget a single one of them. Directed capably by Julius Avery, his 
    sophomore theatrical film, and written with a sense of verve and 
    horror by Billy Ray and Mark L. Smith, this is a film best 
    experienced than explained, but you'll see some very horrific moments 
    that won't leave your mind for a long, long time, especially when 
    Boyce injects Chase with the serum after he dies from the head shot. 
    It's one for the books, folks! I almost lost my lunch (and I'm not 
    lying)! A complete surprise from beginning to end. Recommended.; <B><A HREF="annihilation_2018.htm">ANNIHILATION</A><A NAME="Annihilation2018"></A></B> 
    (2018) is one of those films that may be confusing at first, but long 
    after it is over, it will still have you thinking of certain events 
    and how they fit together like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle before 
    you have that &quot;Aha!&quot; moment, where everything finally makes 
    sense. I will try to explain the film (without spoilers) to help the 
    uninitiated make sense of the film's many flashbacks and 
    flash-forwards, if they are, indeed, that, after all. Something from 
    outer space hits a lighthouse on the coast of the Florida swamplands 
    and, from that moment on, forms a weird misty barrier around it that 
    keeps growing and growing exponentially, threatening to envelope the 
    entire United States (and the rest of the world). Scientists and the 
    Government have dubbed this mist &quot;The Shimmer&quot; and have 
    secretly sent soldiers and scientists into it, none to ever return. 
    All except one, that is. That happens to be soldier Kane (Oscar 
    Isaac), the husband of soldier/biologist Lena (Natalie Portman), and 
    when he suddenly shows up at Lena's house after being missing for 
    three years, she is taken aback, but she can see something is 
    seriously wrong with him. She drives him to the hospital, only for 
    both of them to be kidnapped by government agents before they<A HREF="annihilation_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/annihilation amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    get there. When Lena wakes up, she demands to know where her husband 
    is and is told by Agent Lomax (Benedict Wong) that if she wants to 
    save her husband, she must enter The Shimmer with his hand-picked 
    team of female scientists, doctors and soldiers, which includes Dr. 
    Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh), Anya (Gina Rodriguez), Cass (Tuva 
    Novotny), Josie (Tessa Thompson) and Katie (Sonoya Mizuno). Their 
    mission is to discover The Shimmer's purpose and destroy it by making 
    it to the lighthouse and stopping its growth, if that is possible. 
    Lena agrees and all six women enter The Shimmer; from that moment on, 
    their lives will never be the same. What they discover refutes all 
    known laws of science and nature, as man and plant can mutate into a 
    totally new creation and other laws of science are proven contrary to 
    known beliefs. Anything can meld with anything in The Shimmer and the 
    results are completely unforgettable. Lena starts losing members of 
    her team to various strange creations that basically have no 
    scientific explanation or basis in reality as we know it (Wait until 
    you see the mutated wolf/bear here! It blows away anything you have 
    seen in <B><A HREF="prophecy_1979.htm">PROPHECY</A></B> [1979] and 
    the sequence when it is shown attacking can best be described as a 
    true lesson in nail-biting tension!). When Lena makes it to the 
    lighthouse, the entire sequence is like tripping on an 
    hallucinogenic; one long scene of weird, colorful &amp; trippy 
    visuals that will leave your jaw on the floor. It's beautiful, 
    expertly crafted and memorable; something like having a 
    non-threatening nightmare that will haunt you for days to come. Yet 
    there is a message to all these visuals; a message some will not 
    understand until after the film is long over (At least that's what 
    happened to me!), if they understand it at all. Is it a message of 
    hope, of doom or of both? I'm afraid you'll have to make that 
    judgment for yourself after you watch the movie. Directed and written 
    by Alex Garland (director/writer of the vastly underrated <B><A HREF="ex_machina_2014.htm">EX_MACHINA</A></B> 
    - 2014, and screenwriter of <B><A HREF="28_days_later_2003.htm">28

    - 2007 and <B><A HREF="dredd_3d_2012.htm">DREDD</A></B> - 2012) with 
    a flair for great-looking, colorful and downright unusual filmic 
    compositions, as well as unforgettable scenes of bloody violence, 
    this film should be on everyone's must-see list if you are fans of 
    science fiction films or lovers of anything strange and weird. You 
    will not be disappointed. How this flew under everyone's radar is 
    beyond me. A modern-day classic!</FONT></FONT></P>

     DTV Genre Films Part 24a (continued):<A NAME="RoadToHell2018"></A> 
    The Italian action/horror hybrid film <B><A HREF="road_to_hell_2018.htm">ROAD
     TO HELL</A></B> (2018) came as a complete shock to me, even though I 
    couldn't decide whether to put it in the Good or Bad Section, but 
    since I couldn't get the film out of my mind long after I watched it, 
    I thought it belonged in the Good Section. A quartet of small-time 
    thieves, headed by Rusty (director Roberto D'Antona) must perform one 
    last big robbery to save the life of Rusty's cousin (and robbery gang 
    member) Dario (Alessandro Carnevale Pellino), who was caught fucking 
    the daughter, Katia (Alice Vigan&ograve;), of crime kingpin Vincent 
    Costello (Massimo Cominato). Vincent threatens to kill Dario and the 
    rest of them if they don't pull off this big-time<A HREF="road_to_hell_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/road to hell 2018 amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    robbery and deliver the money to him immediately, so Rusty, Dario and 
    Anthony (Francesco Emulo), pull off the robbery while their getaway 
    driver drives them to Robert's Burgers, so they can get a bite to eat 
    (Stealing must make them hungry!). As they are being served their 
    burgers (My God, they are huge!) by pretty waitress Sara (Erica 
    Verzotti), Anthony falls in love with her, but a trio of robbers 
    enter the burger joint planning to rob it, only Rusty will have none 
    of it. Another man in the joint, who looks like a cop, pulls out a 
    gun&nbsp; and a gunfight ensues, resulting in the deaths of Rusty's 
    getaway driver, the trio of robbers and the cop. Only he is not a cop 
    at all, he is actually an agent of a top secret organization known as 
    &quot;Crisalis&quot;, so Rusty, Anthony and Dario, steal the agent's 
    camper van and drive away (but not before Anthony gets Sara's 
    telephone number!). This is when everything turns to sheer horror. As 
    they are driving away in the camper van, Anthony has the dead body of 
    another Crisalis Agent fall on him and then mysterious woman Julia 
    (Annamaria Lorusso) and her son Nicolas (Danilo Uncino) appear, Julia 
    holding a knife and telling the trio to get out of her camper van. 
    Rusty stops the van and disposes of the dead agent's body, telling 
    Julia that she is stuck with the trio until they deliver the money to 
    Vincent Costello, not knowing that the head of Crisalis, Edoardo Di 
    Caprio (Mirko Giacchetti), has sent two Men In Black-like agents, 
    Agent 066 (Michael Segal) and Agent 072 (Aaron T. Maccarthy), to 
    retrieve Julia and Nicolas, because Nicolas is &quot;special&quot;. 
    Rusty and his gang are about to find out how &quot;special&quot; he 
    is, as Crisalis scientist Dr. Davide Leonardi (Federico Mariotti) has 
    invented a serum that turns people who are injected with it into 
    unbeatable killing machines (Crisalis hoped to create the 
    unkillable/unstoppable soldier). Nicolas was injected with this serum 
    because it works better on children than it does adults and whenever 
    Nicolas is put in stressful situations, he morphs into a white-eyed 
    monster, who kills anyone he sees. The first time Nicolas morphs is 
    when Rusty and his gang meet Vincent Costello (who has been working 
    with Crisalis to locate them). They hand him the money, but Costello 
    shoots and kills Dario anyway (He even shoots and kills his daughter 
    Katia, saying, &quot;I can always make another.&quot;). Nicolas turns 
    into a monster and takes a huge bite out of Costello's neck, even 
    killing most of Costello's men (after a gunfight ensues) before Julia 
    manages to calm him down. This is the first part of a long journey 
    for everyone involved and I won't reveal more, except to say that 
    Rusty and his gang are joined by ex-cop Christian (Mirko D'Antona), 
    who has a love/hate relationship with Rusty, but he will prove to be 
    an asset to the gang, as they battle Agents 066 (Who we previously 
    see hire a hooker, kill her [by suffocation with a pillow] and then 
    fuck her dead body!) &amp; 072, Edoardo Di Caprio and his brutal son 
    Claudio Di Caprio (Andrea Milan), who is so mean, he would give Nazi 
    deathcamp officers the chills. What happens is best left for you to 
    discover. This film, directed and written by Roberto D'Antona is full 
    of comedy, horror and graphic bloodshed, things that don't often 
    blend together, which is why I couldn't <A HREF="road_to_hell_2018.htm#Italy Title"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/road to hell 2018 italy poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="215" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>decide
     whether this was a good or bad film, but since I couldn't get 
    certain scenes out of my mind (especially when Anthony&nbsp; suddenly 
    appears from a door with a huge boner in his underwear while Julia 
    and Christian are making love!), I just had to give it a positive 
    review. Doing research on Roberto D'Antona, I discovered that he is 
    kind of a big deal in Italy, as many people look forward to his 
    films. He first started out making a couple of fan films about 
    Italian comic strip character Dylan Dog, <B><A HREF="dylan_dog_the_beginning_2011_dylan_dog_the_devils_trill_2012.htm">DYLAN
     DOG: THE BEGINNING</A></B> (2011) and <B><A HREF="dylan_dog_the_beginning_2011_dylan_dog_the_devils_trill_2012.htm">DYLAN
     DOG: THE DEVIL'S TRILL</A></B> (2012), just to get the bad taste out 
    of his mouth that was the awful film <B><A HREF="dylan_dog_dead_of_night_2010.htm">DYLAN
     DOG: DEAD OF NIGHT</A></B> (2010), which starred Brandon Routh, that 
    was considered an insult in Italy (and the rest of the world!). Since 
    D'Antona was only 20-years-old (!) at the time and his fan films were 
    highly-regarded, this led to him becoming a director/actor on Italian 
    television, eventually morphing into feature films such as <B><A HREF="wicked_gift_2017.htm">THE
     WICKED GIFT</A></B> (2017), a horror film that was also given good 
    reviews. D'Antona is also known for staffing his films &amp; TV 
    series with the same actors (Francesco Emulo, who portrays Anthony, 
    was D'Antona's best friend since grade school and he's absolutely 
    hilarious here; he met Annamaria Lorusso, who portrays Julia, on a 
    short film they appeared in in 2014, so they formed their own 
    production company, L/D Productions, to make films such as this), so 
    there is an easy-going atmosphere in this film and it looks like 
    everyone is having the time of their lives, which results in 
    naturalistic acting. Hey, this isn't rocket science and the film does 
    have some faults (some parts of the film are non-linear, which causes 
    confusion), but the film moves at a brisk pace, is shot beautifully 
    and contains a damn good music score (by Aurora Rochez; <B><A HREF="italian_ghost_stories_2011.htm">PARANORMAL
     STORIES</A></B> - 2011). Try it, you might like it. Shot as <B><A HREF="road_to_hell_2018.htm#Italy Title">FINO
     ALL'INFERNO</A></B> (&quot;Until Hell&quot;). Available free 
    streaming on Amazon Prime (for Prime members), in Italian with 
    English subtitles. I'm looking forward to D'Antona's next directorial 
    feature, <B><A HREF="last_heroes_2019.htm">THE LAST HEROES</A></B> 
    (2019). I only hope it is half as memorable as this film.;<A NAME="Encounter2018"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B>&quot;I am all of you.&quot;</B> Not all aliens are friendly, but <B><A HREF="encounter_2018.htm">ENCOUNTER</A></B> 
    (2018) leaves you hanging until the final minutes of the film to find 
    out if this alien is friendly or not. And it's a really good ride to 
    get to the answer. The film opens in North Carolina, where Sheriff's 
    Deputies, a S.W.A.T. team and F.B.I. Agents storming a house, the two 
    head F.B.I. Agents, Tevis (Wendy Davis) and Banks (Peter Holden; <B><A HREF="under_the_bed_2012.htm">UNDER
     THE BED</A></B> - 2012), telling everyone to use &quot;lethal 
    force&quot; if necessary. We hear the sounds of gunshots and an agent 
    saying over the radio, &quot;We've got the pod.&quot; We are then in 
    Virginia, as we watch wheelchair-bound Will Dawkins (Luke Hemsworth; 
    HBO's <B><A HREF="westworld_tv_series_2016.htm">WESTWORLD</A></B> 
    [2016 - Present]) painting a picture of a little girl . Will lives in 
    his sister Teresa's (Cheryl Texiera; <B><A HREF="bunnyman_2009.htm">BUNNYMAN</A></B> 
    - 2009) garage and we know something major happened to him to put him 
    in a wheelchair, but we won't find out what it was until the film is 
    nearly over. All we do know is that it is highly emotional for Will 
    and Teresa. We then see three men drinking beer in a field, Brent 
    (Glenn Keogh), Teresa's husband, Johnny (Christopher Showerman) and 
    the deeply religious Marcus (Vincent M. Ward), discussing their 
    lives, when they see an object streaking in the night sky and landing 
    in a nearby field. They take their truck to where the object landed 
    and pour the ice water in their beer cooler on the object to cool it 
    down. The object lets out a screeching sound that sends all three men 
    to their knees and holding their ears. When it stops, they put the 
    object in the cooler and take it to Brent's house. You guessed it. 
    They open up the garage door, clear off one of Will's tables and pour 
    the object out of the cooler. Yep, it looks like a small pod and they 
    tell Will and Teresa that it must be valuable and someone should 
    stand guard over it during the night. Will volunteers, <A HREF="encounter_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/encounter 2018 poster8a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>over
     Marcus' objections (Marcus has something against Will; maybe because 
    he doesn't believe in God?), but Marcus is overruled by Brent and 
    Johnny and they all stay at the house because they don't trust each 
    other. While Will is standing guard over the pod late at night, he 
    doesn't see the pod opening, a tentacle coming out of it and 
    attaching to Will's neck. As soon as the tentacle is attached to his 
    neck, Will sees his entire life flash before his eyes (pay close 
    attention and you will see what happened that put him in a 
    wheelchair). The following morning, everyone goes to the garage to 
    make sure the pod is still there. What they find shocks them. Will is 
    standing on his own two feet, something doctors said wouldn't be 
    possible ever, but when they see the tentacle still in Will's neck, 
    they pull it off and Will's legs no longer work. Will wants the alien 
    to attach to him again, telling everyone that they should let the pod 
    attach to them, too; it means no harm. They carry Will to the living 
    room and then Brent says they need someone to come here to look at 
    the object, a scientist or someone like that. Johnny says his old 
    college biology teacher, Professor Westlake (an excellent Tom Atkins; <B><A HREF="#Trick2019">TRICK</A></B> 
    - 2019), would be the perfect one to come look at it, even if he 
    failed Johnny for never showing up for class. Brent and Johnny go to 
    speak to Professor Westlake, while Marcus takes a look at the field 
    where the pod landed to see if they missed anything. What no one 
    realizes is Agent Tevis and Banks are aware that the pod has crashed 
    and when Marcus goes to look at the field, they secretly watch him 
    and he becomes their &quot;person of interest.&quot; If you want to 
    know more, I suggest that you watch the film (it's available 
    streaming on Amazon Prime), as, if I tell you any more, I will 
    deprive you of a film that manages to surprise&nbsp; and affect you 
    in ways very few films have achieved. If you don't have a lump in 
    your throat and a tear in your eye when the film ends, you, my 
    friend, aren't human. Director/screenwriter Paul Salamoff (this is 
    only his second feature film as director) has delivered a film that 
    not only gets you involved mentally, it also get you involved 
    emotionally, because the cast here is simply amazing and act like 
    normal people would. There's hardly a false note in the film and 
    you'll be rooting for everyone to succeed in their plans, simply 
    because their plans aren't outlandish, they are what any normal 
    person would do. Would you want an alien to attach a tentacle to you, 
    even though Will swears the alien doesn't mean them any harm? 
    Everything comes into place when Professor Westlake, who is dying 
    from pancreatic cancer and has no friends or family, discovers what 
    the alien is really up to. I'm not going to say anymore except that 
    this is a film that will not only get you involved, it will touch 
    your heart, especially ther final line in the film (which is at the 
    beginning of this review). And the pod gets bigger every time it 
    attaches itself to a human. To find out how it all ends, watch the 
    film ASAP! You won't be sorry.;<A NAME="Antrum2018"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    The &quot;cursed film&quot; genre is very small, but that is because 
    it is a subject that is very hard to pull off. The only successful 
    ones in my opinion were not films at all, but a 2005 episode of 
    Showtime's <B><A HREF="masters_of_horrors_dvds.htm">MASTERS OF HORROR</A></B> 
    titled &quot;Cigarette Burns&quot;, directed by John Carpenter, and 
    the one-hour French pseudo-documentary <B><A HREF="fury_of_the_demon_2015.htm">FURY
     OF THE DEMON</A></B> (2015), directed by Fabien Delage. Other films 
    that tried were <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#MidnightMovie2008">MIDNIGHT
     MOVIE</A></B> (2008), <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HillsRunRed">THE 
    HILLS RUN RED</A></B> (2009) and <B><A HREF="cinemaphobia_2009.htm">CINEMAPHOBIA</A></B> 
    (2009; Which is so bad I refuse to review it!), but they were nothing 
    but generic horror flicks with nothing much to add to the genre. Then 
    along comes <B><A HREF="antrum_the_deadliest_film_ever_made_2018.htm">ANTRUM:
     THE DEADLIEST FILM EVER MADE</A></B> (2018), a film so unusual and 
    downright frightening, it tosses the genre on its head, stomps on it 
    and then delivers the goods. The film opens with a short 8-minute 
    &quot;documentary' explaining the cursed film named <B>ANTRUM</B>, a 
    horror film made in 1977 (it actually contains two date years on the 
    title screen, 1977 &amp; 1979, which just adds more mystery to the 
    film) that no one had actually seen and lived long afterwards. A 
    movie theater in Romania in 1988 showed the film and the audience of 
    56 people burned to death in a fire while the film was playing. The 
    fire didn't start in the projection booth, as many fires do in 
    theaters since celluloid is highly flammable, but in the audience 
    itself, which couldn't be explained by the fire marshalls 
    investigating the deadly fire. During the<A HREF="antrum_the_deadliest_film_ever_made_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/antrum poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    early-'80s, the film was submitted to three film festivals, but all 
    the people who screened the film to see it it was going to be 
    accepted into their festival died under mysterious (and violent) 
    circumstances. The film then was considered lost, until someone 
    recently found a print. After the documentary is over, we then see 
    the film in its entirety, with the usual <A HREF="antrum_the_deadliest_film_ever_made_2018.htm#LegalNotice">legal
     warning</A> that watching the film may cause your death (or worse). 
    The thing is, it actually works here, as the film is shot so 
    unusually, you can feel the desperation and horror in your body and 
    your mind. The story is quite unique. When his pet dog bites him, 
    young Nathan's (Rowan Smyth) mother takes the dog to a vet and has it 
    put to sleep, making Nathan watch his favorite pet die. Nathan has 
    recurring nightmares about his dog's death, especially when his cruel 
    mother tells him that his dog went to Hell instead of Heaven for 
    biting him. Nathan's older teenage sister, Oralee (Nicole Tompkins), 
    wants to help Nathan's nightmares stop, so she and Nathan take a 
    weekend trip to the forest, where Oralee shows him a book of spells 
    that will save his dog's soul and send it to Heaven. She tells Nathan 
    that they must go to the place where Satan landed when thrown out of 
    Heaven by God; they must dig a deep hole to Hell on that spot, rescue 
    the dog's soul and then send it to Heaven. There are &quot;Five 
    Layers&quot; to Hell, each layer with its own dangers, but if they 
    are successful in their task, his dog will have an eternity of 
    happiness. Yes, it sounds ridiculous, but directors/writers David 
    Amito and Michael Laicini pull it off in amazing fashion, as the film 
    has the look, the grain and the exact feel of a '70s supernatural 
    horror film, so much so that you will actually believe it was made 
    during that time period. There are many amazing and quite eerie 
    sights to behold, including two fanatical hunters (one whom we see 
    fucking the dead carcass of a deer!) who capture Nathan and Oralee 
    and try roasting the young boy alive in a hollow steel statue of a 
    goat-headed Devil (reminding me very much of <B><A HREF="wicker_man_1973.htm">THE
     WICKER MAN</A></B> - 1973). This film manages to bring goosebumps 
    because of some quite unique subliminal images throughout the film, 
    which not only brings on a sense of uneasiness, it also will make you 
    freeze the film to try and catch what those images are (not only are 
    there images of a nearly naked man and woman being torturerd for 
    reasons unknown, there are also symbols representing Asmodeus [over 
    170 of them!] and several terms in Latin, including &quot;Facilis 
    Descensus Averno&quot; [&quot;Descent To Hell&quot;] and &quot;Nihil 
    Pretiosius Veritate&quot; [&quot;The Truth Is More Precious&quot;], 
    which just adds more to the mystery of the film). There are plenty of 
    surprising revelations to be had here, especially the truth about 
    Oralee's supernatural book (If I tell you, it will ruin the surprise) 
    and some other things that if I told you, you would probably not 
    believe me. This is a film that demands to me watched more than once, 
    because there are things going on in the background and foreground 
    (and subliminally) that you quite probably won't see in one viewing. 
    I predict that this film will become a cult classic if enough people 
    see it. At the time of this writing, it is available streaming on 
    Amazon Prime or you can go on Amazon and purchase the DVD. Whatever 
    way you see it, this is bound to become a film you will think about 
    long after it is over. It took me nearly two weeks to write this 
    short review, just so I could get the film out of my head. Shouldn't 
    all films affect you this way? My highest recommendation.;<A NAME="Abrakadabra2018"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;

    (2015). I haven't seen those two films, but if they are anything like 
    this one, I will put them on my Must-See list. This film certainly 
    has the look and feel of a '70s Giallo flick and after watching it 
    for a few minutes, I totally forgot it was a modern film and enjoyed 
    the ride it offered. The mystery is excellent, the killer brutal and 
    the reveal of the killer in the finale surprised even me, a Giallo 
    fanatic who can usually spot the killer long before a film ends. The 
    film begins in 1951, where world-famous magician Dante The Great 
    (Raul Gederlini) is about to perform the &quot;Bullet Catch&quot; 
    trick, where he has a gun fired at him and he catches the bullet in 
    his teeth. Dante's assistant, Gennaro Bernardi (Abel Giannoni), fires 
    the gun and Dante lies dead, as someone loaded the gun with full-load 
    bullets, not the special low-load bullets that were supposed to be in 
    the gun. Gennaro is accused of murder, tried, convicted and is sent 
    to prison, but it couldn't be that easy, could it? Thirty years 
    later, we see Dante's son, magician Lorenzo Mancini (German Baudino), 
    on a motor scooter with his female assistant Antonella (Mar&iacute;a 
    Eugenia Rigon) as they are traveling down a road in Argentina (this 
    is an Argentina/New Zealand co-production) on their way to the 
    theater where Lorenzo is about to <A HREF="abrakadabra_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/abrakadabra poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="209" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>make
     his debut. When they get to the theater, there is a group of 
    bystanders and police in front of the theater, as Lorenzo's agent, 
    Fabrizio (Pablo Vilela), appears and tells Lorenzo not to worry, this 
    will not affect his opening night. What won't affect it, you may ask? 
    Why, there's an old woman on stage, dead, and her head is inside 
    Lorenzo's &quot;Box With Swords&quot; device. Her head has swords 
    stuck through it until the blades exit out her cheeks and there's an 
    Ace of Spades card in her mouth. The Detective on the case, Agent 
    Caruso (Claudio Rusiecky), questions Lorenzo, asking him if he knew 
    the victim and he says no, he has never seen her before. When Agent 
    Caruso asks about his whereabouts at the time of her death, Lorenzo 
    says he was with Antonella all night and all day, so the Detective 
    tells him he will need to speak to her to verify his alibi. As you 
    can probably guess, this will not be the only murder that will haunt 
    Lorenzo, as many more people end up dead, the closer Lorenzo, who 
    decides to act as a detective, gets to the truth. There's also a 
    chain-smoking man that keeps following Lorenzo around everywhere he 
    goes, which makes him extremely nervous. Could this man be the 
    killer? As with all Giallo films, the easy answer is never the right 
    answer. On opening night, Lorenzo bombs with the audience, but 
    Antonella takes the blame, telling Lorenzo she was late on her cue, 
    spoiling his magic trick. Add that to the fact that everyone Lorenzo 
    talks to ends up dead with one of his magic devices as the murder 
    weapon and what Lorenzo has is a big problem (Besides his alcoholism 
    [And, yes, <A HREF="j&amp;b_scotch_whiskey_in_italian_films.htm">bottles
     of J&amp;B Scotch Whiskey</A> are seen throughout the film!], he 
    also cheats at cards, gets caught by three other players at a Poker 
    game and is then beaten to a pulp.). He discovers that his father's 
    accused killer has been out of prison for the past ten years and when 
    he goes to talk to&nbsp; Gennaro Bernardi, he discovers that he is on 
    his deathbed and it was impossible for him to be the killer. Gennaro 
    soon ends up dead by the killer's hand (the killer injects a red 
    poison into Gennaro's IV line), but not before he tells Lorenzo that 
    he didn't murder his father and says that Lorenzo knows who killed 
    him, he just has wiped it from&nbsp; his memory at the place that 
    &quot;brainwashed&quot; him; a place he stayed for a long, long time 
    when he was a foster child. That's all I am going to tell you, 
    otherwise I would have to spill the beans, something I never do with 
    a Giallo review. The Onetti Brothers do an excellent job giving this 
    film the look and feel of an actual Giallo film of the past (the film 
    begins with an on-screen quote from Harry Houdini [<I><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;What
     the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes!&quot;</FONT></I>] 
    and the opening credits sequence is excellent), bathing the film in 
    primary colors and framing shots (judiciously using zooms to good 
    effect) that will remind you of many '70s Giallo films. They also 
    overdub all the actors perfectly. It's not until the end credits 
    (this film runs a scant 70 minutes) that the killer's identity is 
    revealed and it did surprise me (even if it is a trope used in many 
    films like this in the past). The Onetti Brothers also directed the 
    torture porn film <B><A HREF="what_the_waters_left_behind_2017.htm">WHAT
     THE WATERS LEFT BEHIND</A></B> (2017), which I will watch even 
    though I'm not a fan of the genre. Brothers with talents like they 
    show in this film should be supported, no matter what kind of film 
    they make. Luciano Onetti also supplied the wonderful Goblin-esque 
    music soundtrack to the film. This gets a high recommendation from 
    me, so if you are a fan of Gialli and believe that they don't make 
    'em like they use to, here is a great example to prove you wrong. <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">VERY

    First a word of warning about the following movie: If you are not 
    computer literate or tech savvy, do not watch <B><A HREF="h0us3_2018.htm">H0US3</A></B> 
    (2018), because it is a talky film full of computer and Internet 
    lingo that you will not comprehend and you will probably become bored 
    early in the film. But if you fully understand such things, you are 
    going to love this flick. A group of longtime college friends, 
    including hosts Rafa (Rub&egrave;n Serrano) and his wife Lucia 
    (Cristina Raya), David (Roc Esquius) and his girlfriend Sara (Diana 
    Roig), Julia (Anna Bertran) and her lawyer boyfriend Ricardo (Victor 
    Gomez), Dani (Bernat Mestre) and girlfriend Eva (Mariona Tena), and 
    the stag Monica (M&iacute;riam Tortosa) , an expert computer 
    programmer who just broke up with her longtime boyfriend, gather at a 
    house in the middle of nowhere to have a weekend of fun and 
    conversation, as they have not seen each other for quite some time. 
    Over dinner, we learn that Rafa (who comes across as a major asshole) 
    is an expert hacker and works in conjuction with the hacker group 
    Anonymous, where he got hold of a 350Gb file of secret government 
    information, including an app that will change the course of history, 
    only the file is protected by an ultra-secure password that would 
    take longer than a thousand lifetimes to crack. Somehow, Rafi was 
    able to crack the password and download an app from this file on<A HREF="h0us3_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/h0us3 spain poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    his phone. He has David, who has been his friend since childhood, try 
    out the app, which uses the phone's camera, and discovers that it 
    actually shows what is about to happen 31 seconds in the future (He 
    sees a water bottle on the table, which is standing upright, only on 
    the camera, it is tipped over on its side. He then accidentally tips 
    it over with his foot thirty-one seconds later)! Eva thinks it is 
    nothing but a joke, so she tries using Rafi's phone and discovers a 
    fully lit lamp's lightbulb is no longer lit on the camera. Thirty-one 
    seconds later the lightbulb fails and is no longer lit (Eva freaks 
    out, since she is not computer literate)! Everyone wonders if they 
    can increase the time the app can look into the future, but Rafi 
    tells them that the app is also password protected and he was not 
    able to crack it. Monica theorizes that she could break the password 
    since whomever created the app used a smaller password than the 
    entire file Rafi hacked. She is able to crack the password, which is 
    &quot;H0us3&quot; (people frequently use the number &quot;0&quot; in 
    place of the letter &quot;O&quot; and the number &quot;3&quot; in 
    place of the letter &quot;E&quot;. Admit it, you do the same thing, 
    right?) and is able to change the time from 31 seconds into the 
    future to three hours and five minutes into the future (They verify 
    it works by pointing the phone's camera at a clock). The group then 
    gets carried away and programs it to see thirteen days into the 
    future and what they find chills them all to the core. I'm not going 
    to tell you what they see because I will be destroying you of the 
    pleasure of discovering it for yourself, but there's a surprise twist 
    at the end that also contains another surprise twist as a denouement. 
    This Spanish film (which is expertly dubbed into English) was the 
    freshman debut of director/co-writer/co-producer Manolo Munguia 
    (Sergio Martinez, also a freshman, co-wrote and co-produced this, as 
    well as being Assistant Director, Editor and Production Manager 
    here), is dialogue-heavy, but I was never bored because it posed some 
    serious questions about time travel, such as this conundrum: If you 
    look into the future and saw you ate a bagel for breakfast, what 
    would happen if you changed it with an English muffin? Would it 
    change the course of history or would nothing happen? Rafi and David 
    also tell everyone that they can guess their passwords by asking five 
    simple questions, but they must be honest in their answers. How they 
    do it is simply amazing. These are serious things to think about, but 
    what would happen if they were not the only ones using this app and 
    could look into the future and see you using the app? There are 
    serious and deadly consequences to doing this, since this world has 
    changed drastically in little over a decade, when &quot;smart 
    phones&quot; are now more powerful than computers were a mere ten 
    years ago. All the dialogue rings true here, as it is all based on 
    fact (Mentioning the Sony hack, Julian Assange and the WikiLeaks 
    scandal, as well as Edward Snowden and the NSA hack. Did they both 
    use this app to avoid capture? [something not based on 
    fact...probably]) and the English dubbing is literate and 
    mesmerizing. I know a lot of people will complain that this film is 
    too talky because they don't understand any of it, but more and more 
    people are becoming computer literate today, because, let's face it, 
    if they don't, they fall behind the curve), as this world is 
    basically run and controlled by computers and the Internet. You 
    either embrace it or hate it, but there is no denying it. This film 
    displays all those positives and negatives just in the performances 
    of the cast. Well worth your time if you want to think long after the 
    film is over.</FONT></FONT></P>

     OF HELL</A></B> (2018) did exactly that to me. It's a horror Western 
    that plays more like nightmarish Gothic horror film that is set in 
    1872 on a train making a midnight run to Atlanta, Georgia. On <A HREF="west_of_hell_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/west of hell poster6a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>board
     this train is a freed slave named Jericho Whitfield (an excellent 
    Tony Todd; <B><A HREF="#CandyCorn2019">CANDY CORN</A></B> - 2019) who 
    is on this train for one purpose only: to kill Annie Hargraves 
    (Jennifer Laporte), the daughter of his former boss, a Southern 
    plantation owner where Jericho was a slave. Jericho watched as 
    Annie's father scalped Jericho's young daughter for a minor 
    infraction, killing her. In Jericho's mind, the only proper 
    retribution is to kill Annie, so his former boss will feel the pain 
    he feels. The only problem is that Annie has protection on this 
    train, a gunslinger named Roland Bursley (Michael Eklund; <B><A HREF="divide_2011.htm">THE
     DIVIDE</A></B> - 2011), whom Annie's father hired to protect her on 
    her travels to Atlanta and he is good at his job. Jericho and Roland 
    bump heads immediately, where Jericho tells Roland his plans, saying 
    there is no way Annie will make it off this train alive. It almost 
    leads to a gunfight, but there's something more deadly on the train. 
    Something evil is on the train murdering the passengers, so Jericho 
    and Roland form an uneasy truce and band together to battle it. It 
    turns out that everyone on board this train is hiding deadly secrets 
    of their own, including a former female slave, Desdemona Lark (Jeryl 
    Prescott), a wealthy, snooty woman, Grace McDowell (Jill Hoiles) and 
    a priest, Father Locke (producer/story writer Yousef Abu-Taleb), who 
    tries battling a demon sent by the Devil (an extended cameo by Lance 
    Henriksen; <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm#PenitentMan2010">THE
     PENITENT MAN</A></B> - 2010) and loses badly (Father Locke is guilty 
    of the sin of coveting naked female flesh). It seems that the Devil 
    is making this a train ride to Hell, as no one aboard this train is 
    worth saving, even Jericho and Annie (who is more evil than her 
    father). Will anyone survive this train ride to Hades? That's the 
    plot in a nutshell, but this film is shot so weirdly, it's almost 
    impossible to describe. The editing in this film is so confusing that 
    I began to think it was done on purpose to make the viewer feel 
    exactly as the people on the train, wondering what in the Hell is 
    going on. And it works, or at least it did for me, but others may 
    disagree strongly. There are atmospheric scenes that jump at the 
    viewer out of nowhere, some scenes to show us the passengers' deadly 
    sins and other times the scenes make no sense at all, but they are 
    beautiful and perplexing at the same time. Director/co-screenwriter 
    Michael Steves (<B><A HREF="clinger_2015.htm">CLINGER</A></B> - 2015) 
    has fashioned a fever dream of a film, as there is enough of a plot 
    to keep the film moving forward, mixed in with scenes so 
    otherworldly, they seem to belong in another film. But, unlike other 
    films where this technique might not work, it does here. I sat on the 
    fence for days wondering whether I was going to put this film in the 
    Good or Bad category, but since I thought so much about this film 
    after it was over, I could only put it in this category. I know a lot 
    of people are going to disagree with me, but I honestly could only 
    put it here. It's not often that a film makes me think so deeply, 
    looking for answers I know I will never get, but this is a special 
    film, at least to me. Mileage may vary for others as they take this 
    train ride. This film contains female nudity and some pretty good 
    blood and gore, but it doesn't dominate the film like some modern DTV 
    films do. Also featuring Richard Riehle (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hatchet2007">HATCHET</A></B>

    (2018), it was announced that this was comedian David Spade's first 
    dramatic role, so, of course, I just had to watch it to see Spade 
    fall flat on his face. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that 
    Spade was quite good in a role with no comedic elements at all. The 
    plot deals with Bobby (Spade) trying to gain the water rights to a 
    piece of property that his sickly grandfather, Calvin (Bruce Dern; <B><A HREF="hateful_eight_2015.htm">THE
     HATEFUL EIGHT</A></B> - 2015) was trying to<A HREF="warning_shot_2018.htm"><IMG SRC="images/warning shot 2018 poster6a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    purchase for half his life, but the man that owned the rights kept 
    refusing his offers. Bobby, who wants to get in the good graces of 
    his grandfather, figures that if he can buy the water rights from 
    this man, his grandfather will finally accept him as a good 
    businessman, as Calvin keeps putting him down. Bobby hires two men, 
    drug dealer Jawari (Dwight Henry; <B><A HREF="12_years_a_slave_2013.htm">12
     YEARS A SLAVE</A></B> - 2013) and the psychopathic Rainy (Guillermo 
    D&iacute;az; <B><A HREF="evilution_2008.htm">EVILUTION</A></B> - 
    2008; who steals the film from everyone else), to &quot;talk&quot; to 
    the man about signing away his water rights, but Bobby tells them 
    just to pressure the man, not kill him, as he will go to the house a 
    short time later to have the man sign the papers. We are then 
    introduced to single mother Audrey (Tammy Blanchard;) and her 
    pre-teen daughter Cheyenne (Onata Aprile), who have just returned 
    from Audrey's grandfather's funeral and are talking to his lawyer 
    Pendleton (James Earl Jones, in a brief cameo), who informs Audrey 
    that her grandfather's will will be read in a week, but she may want 
    to check out his house and eighty acres of property, as it might just 
    have been willed to her and Cheyenne. Audrey is going through some 
    tough financial problems and may be kicked out of the trailer they 
    live in, so she and Cheyenne go to check out Grandpa's house as 
    somewhere new to live. As you can probably guess Grandpa is the man 
    that Calvin was trying to buy the water rights from, but neither he 
    nor Bobby know that he is dead. As Audrey and Cheyenne drive to the 
    house, they are taken hostage by Jawari and Rainy, tied up and put 
    in&nbsp; the living room of Grandpa's house. When they learn that the 
    old man has died, Rainy, who is psychotic to the extreme, but not 
    stupid, says that Audrey can wait for Bobby to come to the house and 
    sign the papers since she is probably the new rightful owner of the 
    water rights. As Jawari smokes pot and sniffs cocaine, Rainy decides 
    to rape Audrey and when she refuses to go with him, Rainy picks up 
    Cheyenne and says he'll rape her instead (we will soon learn that 
    Rainy is a sociopath to the nth degree). When Audrey pleads to take 
    her instead, Rainy makes her say, &quot;I want you to make love to 
    me.&quot; and just about as she is about to say it, there's a knock 
    on the front door. Thinking it is Bobby, Rainy answers the door and 
    is surprised to find it's an uber-religious man called David (Frank 
    Whaley; <B><A HREF="vacancy_2007.htm">VACANCY</A></B> - 2007), who 
    wants to know if Rainy has found Christ in his life. David then sees 
    a tied-up Audrey by a window begging for help and goes to leave, but 
    Rainy takes him prisoner instead. Rainy puts a tied-up David on the 
    couch along with Audrey and Cheyenne and begins to play mind games 
    with the trio (when Jawari complains, Rainy knocks him out by gun-butting
     him in the head with his rifle. Don't ever call it a gun, if you 
    don't want to get hurt!), such as calling David gay (which he is) and 
    belittling him because the Bible and the word of the Lord says 
    homosexuality is a sin, to playing a game with Audrey where he asks 
    five questions and if she answers them truthfully, he will not 
    sexually abuse her or her daughter.&nbsp; His questions reveal that 
    Audrey was the class valedictorian in high school and she went to 
    college, but had to drop out. Rainey tells her she dropped out of 
    college because she became pregnant with Cheyenne and Audrey 
    confesses she was raped by a friend in college and when he denied it 
    to the college Dean and won, Audrey had no choice but to quit 
    college. These are all things Audrey did not want Cheyenne to know (I 
    must say that even though Rainy is a psycho madman, he is very 
    intellectual). Eventually, David tries to escape, only to get shot in 
    the leg and Rainy then uses his knife to stab Jawari to death (they 
    had a long and troublesome relationship when Jawari sold him a bag of 
    pot years ago that was full of stems. Rainy has never forgotten that 
    and holds a deadly grudge.), just as Bobby arrives at the house and 
    learns that Audrey owns the water rights now. Bobby makes Audrey sign 
    over the rights to him, just as David crawls over to Jawari's body 
    and grabs his pistol. This allows Audrey and Cheyenne to escape 
    (David gives them the pistol and holds Bobby at bay with Rainy's 
    knife) and run into the woods (turns out Rainy hates trees because he 
    had to hide out in the forest to avoid the cops, who wanted Rainy for 
    killing his girlfriend!), with Rainy chasing them. Bobby wrestles 
    David for the knife only to get it planted in his leg. He pulls the 
    knife out and stabs David viciously over and over until David dies, 
    leaving a big puddle of blood on the floor. Audrey plants a shovel 
    directly into Rainy's face (and nearly shoots his ear off when he 
    dares her to pull the trigger of the pistol she points at him), but 
    he still gets up and chases them. Audrey and Cheyenne must cross a 
    raging stream to get away, so Cheyenne rides on Audrey's back until 
    they get on the other side (Audrey nearly drowns in the process). 
    Rainy discovers a safer way to cross the creek (a bridge maybe?) and 
    holds his rifle in Audrey's face. Just as he is about to pull the 
    trigger, Cheyenne grabs the rifle's barrel and pushes it upward, 
    allowing Audrey to shoot Rainy with the pistol and kill him, his body 
    falling into the creek. Audrey then confronts Bobby at the house and 
    when <A HREF="warning_shot_2018.htm"><IMG SRC="images/warning shot 2018 poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>he
     tries to grab for his gun in his satchel, Audrey empties the pistol 
    into his body, killing him. At the reading of her grandfather's will, 
    where Audrey and Cheyenne inherit the house and property, Audrey asks 
    Pendleton who owns the water rights. He tells Audrey that the State 
    does, as her grandfather was too old to take care of the water pipes, 
    so the State took it away from him. If Bobby would have known that, 
    none of this would have happened, as the State would have sold him 
    the water rights very cheap. Maybe Bobby was actually a bad 
    businessman like his grandfather thought. The film ends with the 
    quote: <B>&quot;We never know the worth of water till the well is 
    dry.&quot; <FONT COLOR="MAROON">- Thomas Fuller</FONT></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     This is an excellent thriller with an award-worthy performance by 
    Guillermo D&iacute;az as Rainy. There's unquestionably nothing he 
    wouldn't do to get his way, as his sociopathic ways shows us, but he 
    is intelligent enough to know that emotional torture is more painful 
    than physical torture, as he proves with Audrey in the house. It not 
    only makes the viewer very uncomfortable, but he keeps Onata Aprile 
    as Cheyenne crying throughout nearly the entire film, as her mother 
    reveals that she quit college because she was pregnant with her, 
    right to discovering that she was a child of rape (there are a few 
    more surprises I will leave for you to discover). As a matter of 
    fact, everyone in the film does a fantastic job, even David Spade, 
    best known for juvenile comedies as <A HREF="black_sheep_1996.htm"><B>BLACK

    of the film takes place in the house's living room), as the film is 
    never boring and zips along, thanks to Guillermo D&iacute;az's 
    demented, but finely-layered, performance. If you like thrillers and 
    think there are no really good ones in recent history made on a 
    limited budget, then seek out this one. It won't disappoint. It's 
    available on YouTube, Amazon Prime and Tubi, so it's available to 
    anyone with an Internet connection to watch and enjoy (nervously as 
    it may be).</FONT></FONT></P>

    Zombie's <B><A HREF="3_from_hell_2019.htm">3 FROM HELL</A></B><A NAME="ThreeFromHell2019"></A> 
    (2019) is the long-awaited sequel to <B><A HREF="devils_rejects_2005.htm">THE

     OF 1000 CORPSES</A></B> (2002). Thankfully, it was worth the wait. 
    Now I know Rob Zombie is a polarizing figure; people either love him 
    or hate him, there is no middle ground, but what I love about Zombie 
    reminds me of that old saying: &quot;The Devil is in the 
    details&quot;, as Zombie is in control of everything, even to the 
    smallest detail. His films have a look and feel like no other films 
    being made today, something which I like to call &quot;White Trash 
    Horror&quot;. Nearly all the characters act like they just exited the 
    trailer park where they were raised their <A HREF="3_from_hell_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/3 from hell 2019 poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="215" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>entire
     lives. Call me weird, call me insane, but that type of character 
    interests me to no end. And this film has plenty of those characters. 
    To those of you who are fans of <B>REJECTS</B>, you may be asking 
    yourself, &quot;How can there be a sequel when the three main 
    characters were killed at the end of the film?&quot; I'm happy to 
    reveal that they didn't die. The film opens documentary-style, 
    showing us the story about what happens after the shootout at the end 
    of the second film. They were very seriously wounded and captured by 
    the police. All three were shot more than twenty times and spent over 
    a year in the hospital recovering before they were put on trial for 
    first degree murder of 38 people (the results of the first two 
    films). Baby Firefly (Sheri Moon Zombie; Rob Zombie's <B><A HREF="lords_of_salem_2012.htm">THE
     LORDS OF SALEM</A></B> - 2012) got life behind bars with the 
    possibility of parole after ten years. Both Captain Spaulding (the 
    late <A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_3.htm#SidHaig">Sid Haig</A>; <B><A HREF="spider_baby_1964.htm">SPIDER
     BABY</A></B> - 1964) and Otis Driftwood (Bill Moseley; Zombie's <B><A HREF="halloween_2007.htm">HALLOWEEN</A></B> 
    - 2007) were sentenced to death (Sid Haig has his sentence carried 
    out in prison because he was very ill at the time of filming and his 
    role is nothing but a cameo. You can see he is very ill just by 
    looking at him. Very sad). Cut to ten years later and it's 1988 
    (remember, the first two films took place in the late-'70s). Baby is 
    about to have her first parole hearing and it goes disastrously, as 
    she acts like a total loon and head-butts head female guard Greta (an 
    unrecognizable Dee Wallace; <B><A HREF="cujo_1983.htm">CUJO</A></B> - 
    1983), breaking her nose, when her parole is turned down (she will 
    have to wait five years for her next parole hearing). Otis is on road 
    duty (My only problem with this film. No Death Row inmate would ever 
    be put on road duty), when his half-brother, Winslow Foxworth 
    Coltrane (an effective Richard Brake; Zombie's <B><A HREF="#T31-2016">31</A></B> 
    - 2016), a.k.a. &quot;The Midnight Wolfman&quot;, breaks him free 
    from the chaingang and they murder everyone (including Danny Trejo [<B><A HREF="machete_2010.htm">MACHETE</A></B> 
    - 2010], who returns as bounty hunter Rondo from the second film), 
    which includes both guards and prisoners, as well as a documentary 
    crew doing a story on Otis. The first thing Otis wants to do with his 
    new-found freedom is break Baby out of prison, but first he has to 
    come up with a plan. Meanwhile, Greta is making Baby's life difficult 
    in prison, locking her in a cell with two overweight lesbians who 
    promise to &quot;wreck&quot; Baby for life, only Baby is too much for 
    them and when Greta returns, she discovers the two lesbians dead and 
    written in their own blood on the concrete floor is the message 
    &quot;Fuck you Greta&quot; with a drawing of a heart! Otis and 
    Coltrane then take the family and friends of prison Warden Virgil 
    Harper (a fantastic Jeff Daniel Phillips; Zombie's <B><A HREF="halloween_2_2009.htm">HALLOWEEN
     II</A></B> - 2009) hostage and threatens to kill them unless he 
    frees Baby from prison (Virgil is scared of Baby, saying as soon as 
    he takes the handcuffs off her, she will kill him, so Otis writes him 
    a note to hand to Baby!). Virgil frees Baby (she then kills Greta) 
    and delivers her to Otis at his home, but Otis being Otis, he, Baby 
    and Coltrane viciously murder Virgil, his family and friends. Baby, 
    it turns out, grew crazier while in prison and she gets the attention 
    of a neighbor of Virgil's (the old woman neighbor witnesses Baby 
    chasing a naked women outside and stabbing her over and over with 
    Otis' rather large hunting knife) who then calls the police (When 
    Otis notices Baby's over-the-top behavior, he says to Coltrane, 
    &quot;Who would think that I would ever be the voice of reason!&quot; 
    A very funny comment.). We now have a trio of serial killers once 
    again on the loose, but rather than hoping they die, Zombie makes 
    them seem like anti-heroes and the audience begins hoping they live! 
    This is what I love about Rob Zombie. The trio head to Mexico, where 
    they run afoul of a drug cartel headed by Aquarius (Emilio Rivera; 
    &quot;Marcus Alvarez&quot; on TV's <B><A HREF="sons_of_anarchy_tv_series.htm">SONS
     OF ANARCHY</A></B> [2008-2014] &amp; <B>MYANS M.C.</B> [2018 - 
    Present]), where we discover Rondo was Aquarius' father and he vows 
    revenge, sending his gang, The Black Zombies, to kill the trio. Will 
    they succeed? I will tell you this: There is plenty of room for 
    another sequel, one that I will be more than happy to watch! As I 
    said in the beginning of the review, all three films in this series 
    differ in tone and feel. <B>HOUSE</B> was a straight-up horror film. <B>REJECTS</B> 
    was a combination horror/thriller, while this film is a straight-up 
    thriller with action inserts and some welcome black humor. That's not 
    to say this film isn't extremely bloody and violent, because it is. 
    It is also packed with full-frontal female nudity. The only way to 
    view this film is through the Lionsgate Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack or the 
    4K Blu-Ray, as it is the only way to watch the <B>Unrated</B> 
    version. The version shown in theaters when it had a limited release 
    was the <B>R-Rated</B> version, missing many instances of extreme 
    gore (including Otis skinning the face of a female hunter) and nudity 
    (including Baby chasing the nude woman out of Virgil's house). The 
    DVD is also the R-Rated version. The way Rob Zombie turns this 
    cold-blooded trio into people we care about is quite remarkable, 
    something I believe only Zombie could achieve, as he understands 
    these characters and what makes them tick. When the masked Black 
    Zombie gang attack the Mexico hotel the trio are staying in, we 
    really hope they don't die because the gang is ten times worse than 
    they are, killing women indiscriminately and torturing the trio when 
    they are captured. There is a rather long documentary on the disc 
    which runs almost as long as the film itself. It's filmed in the way 
    of a video diary, as we watch Zombie prepare the film for the rather 
    small 20-day shooting schedule, which is full of twists and turns, 
    especially Sid Haig telling Zombie two weeks before shooting began 
    that he wasn't well enough to perform his role as written, so Zombie 
    had to do some serious script revisions, introducing Richard Brake's 
    character Coltrane in the process (Haig died a few days after this 
    film debuted in limited theatrical release). It's also full of 
    valuable information,<A HREF="3_from_hell_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/3 from hell blu-ray front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="214" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    such as Danny Trejo playing one of the masked Black Zombie gang for 
    free because his role as Rondo was so small. He is actually the one 
    who gets into a machete fight with Otis at the end of the film (a sly 
    in-joke to Trejo's <A HREF="machete_kills_2013.htm">Machete</A> 
    character). There are actually a lot of good extended cameos in this 
    film, where nearly all of them suffer horrible deaths, including 
    Clint Howard (Zombie's <B><A HREF="haunted_world_of_el_superbeasto_2009.htm">THE
     HAUNTED WORLD OF EL SUPERBEASTO</A></B> - 2009) as clown Mr. Baggy 
    Britches (Otis offers to let him live if he makes him laugh and it is 
    only when he pisses his pants in fright that Otis laughs, but that 
    doesn't stop Otis from sending him to &quot;Clown Heaven&quot;.); 
    Richard Edson (<B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Frankenfish">FRANKENFISH</A></B> 
    - 2004) as Mexico hotel owner Carlos Perro, who turns-in the trio to 
    Aquarius for $10,000 (Otis fills Carlos full of holes with a 
    machinegun as he tries to escape in his car); the diminutive Pancho 
    Moler (&quot;Sick-Head&quot; in Zombie's <B><A HREF="31_2016.htm">31</A></B> 
    - 2015) as the one-eyed Mexican dwarf Sebastian, who falls in love 
    with Baby and ends up saving the trio from certain death (In a bout 
    of &quot;normality&quot;, Baby tells Sebastian that he reminds her of 
    her brother Tiny [late actor Matthew McGrory, who appeared in the 
    first two films in the series]. It's a rather touching scene, but 
    that doesn't mean that Sebastian lives); and especially Dee Wallace 
    as Greta, who is so mean, she could make ice melt with one look. The 
    film is also full of blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameos, including 
    Daniel Roebuck (<B><A HREF="cave_girl_1985.htm">CAVEGIRL</A></B> - 
    1985), Steven Michael Quezada (<B><A HREF="rambler_2012.htm">THE RAMBLER</A></B> 
    - 2012), Sean Whalen (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LaidToRest2009">LAID

     OF THE DEAD</A></B> - 2014), Tracey Leigh (as Virgil's wife, who 
    gets her throat graphically slit open by Coltrane), Sylvia Jefferies 
    (as the totally nude woman Baby chases out of Virgil's house and 
    savagely kills), Wade Williams (<B><A HREF="candyman_day_of_the_dead_1999.htm">CANDYMAN:
     DAY OF THE DEAD</A></B> - 1999),Richard Riehle (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hatchet2007">HATCHET</A></B> 
    - 2007) and Austin Stoker (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#AssaultPrecinct1376">ASSAULT
     ON PRECINCT 13</A></B> - 1976) as a TV News Anchorman. And I must 
    say this: I never cared for Sheri Moon Zombie's acting, but she 
    really impressed me here. She's maturing as an actress and this may 
    be the best acting of her career (so far). So what are you waiting 
    for? Go out and purchase this film if you are a Rob Zombie fan. Even 
    if you're not, this one may change your mind!;<A NAME="LittleMonsters2019"></A> 
    I thought I was over zombie films, especially comical ones, but 
    imagine my surprise when I watched Hulu's Original Film <B><A HREF="little_monsters_2019.htm">LITTLE
     MONSTERS</A></B> (2019) and it was so good I didn't want it to 
    end!&nbsp; Well, it does contain an Academy Award&reg;-winning 
    actress (Lupita Nyong'o; Oscar&reg;-winner for Best Supporting 
    Actress in <B><A HREF="12_years_a_slave_2013.htm">12 YEARS A SLAVE</A></B> 
    [2013] and starring in Jordan Peele's <B><A HREF="#Us2019">US</A></B> 
    [2019]) and a screenplay that's completely bonkers, so what's not to 
    like? The film opens with slacker Dave (Alexander England; <B><A HREF="alien_covenant_2017.htm">ALIEN:
     COVENANT</A></B> - 2017) arguing everywhere with his girlfriend Sara 
    (Nadia Townsend; <B><A HREF="knowing_2009.htm">KNOWING</A></B> - 
    2009); the grocery store, the movies and even in a crowded restaurant 
    with friends. Sara wants to get married and have kids, but Dave 
    doesn't want to bring kids into this world, especially his. It turns 
    out he just plain doesn't like kids. David moves out of Sara's 
    apartment, but since he is a slacker, he doesn't think that he has no 
    place to stay, so he ends up at his sister Tess' (Kat Stewart) 
    apartment, sleeping on the couch. Oh, yes, Tess has a young son named 
    Felix (Diesel La Torraca), who has an inquisitive and intelligent 
    mind, asking Dave questions he rather not answer. Long story short, 
    Felix and Dave become friends and Dave comes up with a plan to 
    propose marriage to Sara, which involves Felix dressing as Darth 
    Vader (!) and barging into Sara's apartment, setting up Dave for the 
    proposal. As you can guess, things don't turn out so well, as when 
    Felix/Darth Vader bursts into Sara's apartment, he sees <A HREF="little_monsters_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/little monsters 2019 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Sara
     fucking her boss on the couch! A surprised Sara tells Dave that he 
    left her, so what she is doing should not come as a surprise, but 
    Dave says it's only been two days and tries to escort her boss out of 
    the apartment, only for the boss to beat the shit out of Dave. When 
    Tess finds out what Dave did with Felix, she is furious, telling Dave 
    to get the hell out and not come back, but Felix begs his Mom to let 
    him stay. Tess, relents, but tells Dave he has to keep up his own 
    end. First, he must take Felix to his school in the morning. Dave 
    does just that, but when he sees Felix's beautiful kindergarten 
    teacher, Miss Caroline (Nyong'o), it's love at first sight, at least 
    for Dave. Tess tells Dave that every father of the children in Miss 
    Caroline's class have hit on her with no luck, but that doesn't deter 
    Dave, as he volunteers to escort the kindergarten class with Miss 
    Caroline to Pleasant Valley, a children's park with a petting zoo. 
    This is when the film takes a turn for the deadly, as Pleasant Valley 
    is right next to a &quot;secure&quot; U.S. Army base and it's not as 
    secure as they thought, as zombies have escaped from it and are 
    heading for Pleasant Valley (If you are wondering what zombies are 
    doing at an Army base, you will get no answer here!). Who will live 
    and who will die? This is actually a very raunchy, foul-mouthed film, 
    especially by Josh Gad (<B><A HREF="pixels_2015.htm">PIXELS</A></B> - 
    2015), who portrays famous children's entertainer Teddy McGiggle, who 
    actually despises children when he is not in character. The zombie 
    attack brings out the worst in him, as every other word out of his 
    mouth is &quot;fuck&quot; or variations of the word. Him screaming 
    these obscenities in front of the children, while trying to put the 
    children between him and the zombies (he even shits his pants and 
    blames the smell on Dave, or at least he tries to!), comes as quite a 
    shock to the viewer, as we (or, rather, I) have never seen this done 
    before in a film, especially it being done so often. The film is also 
    very bloody and gory, once again shown in front of the children (some 
    other children visiting Pleasant Valley are turned into zombies, as 
    we watch them chow-down on their victims and the animals in the 
    petting zoo! Miss Caroline's class, along with Dave and Teddy 
    McGiggle, become trapped in the park's gift shop, surrounded by very 
    hungry zombies. After being duped by Teddy (who gets a gory 
    comeuppance), Dave and Miss Caroline must come up with a way to save 
    the children. Maybe Darth Vader will save the day? This Australian 
    horror flick was directed and written by Abe Forsythe (usually a Film 
    Short and Australian TV director) and he has fashioned a film that's 
    funny, foul-mouthed and very gory (the zombie makeups are excellent), 
    sometimes in the same scene (the sequence where Miss Caroline beheads 
    a group of zombies with a shovel is a deftly shot scene that is both 
    hilarious and frightening). I haven't even touched on the finer 
    points of the film, which I will leave for you to discover, but I 
    will say the music is great (Hanson, WTF?!? But it works! And Lupita 
    Nyong'o plays the ukelele and sings like a pro!) and the final scene 
    is touching and nearly brought a tear to my eye (Nearly!). I wouldn't 
    have even watched this film if Hulu didn't offer their streaming 
    service to me (with limited commercials, but only before the film 
    starts and after it ends) for only $1.99 a month for 12 months! That 
    is a great deal, as Hulu offers some very good films, (including the 
    fantastic <B><A HREF="#MomAndDad2017">MOM AND DAD</A></B> - 2017), 
    original series (The Emmy Award&reg;-winning <B><A HREF="handmaids_tale_hulu_series_2017.htm">THE
     HANDMAID'S TALE</A></B>) and original films (Such as their <B><A HREF="into_the_dark_hulu_films_2018.htm">INTO
     THE DARK</A></B>, Blumhouse Television's series of original films, 
    where they make a new horror film every month about 12 holidays of 
    the year [now in its second year]). If you have Hulu, give this film 
    a watch (Wait until you see the zombie that tried to eat a 
    porcupine!). I know you will like it, maybe even more than I did (and 
    I loved it!), as I was not expecting such a gory, swear word-filled, 
    funny zombie film. Well done, Hulu!;<A NAME="Us2019"></A> I was 
    somewhat impressed with director/screenwriter Jordan Peele's 
    sophomore film <B><A HREF="us_2019.htm">US</A></B> (2019), his 
    follow-up to the award-winning <B><A HREF="get_out_2017.htm">GET OUT</A></B> 
    (2017), but the heavy symbolism in this film practically demands that 
    you watch it more than once, which I did. I have to say that though 
    it's a good film, it's not as good as his first film, but then again, 
    what is? When Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o; see <B><A HREF="#LittleMonsters2019">LITTLE
     MONSTERS</A> </B>[2019] above) was a little girl, she broke free of 
    her parents when they were vacationing at a beach town and entered a 
    house of mirrors off the boardwalk and on the beach. Something 
    happened to her that struck her dumb, or she just flat-out refused to 
    speak, but it it was obvious she was scared to death (or, rather, we 
    are made to believe she was scared out of her wits). Now an adult, 
    Adelaide is married to Gabe (Winston Duke; <B><A HREF="avengers_endgame_2019.htm">AVENGERS:
     ENDGAME</A></B> - 2019) and has a young daughter, Zora (Shahadi 
    Wright Joseph), and an even younger son, Jason (Evan Alex) , who 
    wants to be a magician when he grows up. Adelaide now is speaking, 
    but when Gabe wants to vacation in the same beach town where her 
    trauma began, she doesn't want to go, but Gabe has just purchased a 
    new boat and wants to use it, so she is over-ruled by her family. 
    Gabe rents a beach house from his co-worker Josh Tyler (Tim 
    Heidecker; <B><A HREF="tim_and_erics_billion_dollar_movie_2011.htm">TIM
     &amp; ERIC'S BILLION DOLLAR MOVIE</A></B> - 2011) and his wife Kitty 
    (Elisabeth Moss; Hulu's <B><A HREF="handmaids_tale_hulu_series_2017.htm">THE
     HANDMAID'S TALE</A></B> [2017 - Present]), who will also be 
    vacationing at their own beach house a few miles away. As soon as 
    Adelaide enters the beach town, she is overcome with a foreboding 
    sense of doom and she's right on target, even tough Gabe brushes it 
    off as something silly. Adelaide hasn't told Gabe, or anyone, what 
    happened in the house of mirrors when she was a young girl, not 
    because she was afraid no one would believe her, but because she was 
    afraid they would. A few strange things happen to Adelaide's family, 
    such as Jason meeting what seems to be a man made out of straw with 
    blood on one of its hands at the beach and Zora walking towards the 
    house of mirrors as if in a trance (Yes, the house of mirrors is 
    still there), until Adelaide snaps her out of it, but she still can't 
    get Gabe to understand that<A HREF="us_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/us poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    she doesn't feel safe here and wants to go home (Gabe makes jokes out 
    of everything), until she tells him what happened to her on the beach 
    when she was a young girl. While she was in the house of mirrors, she 
    saw her doppelganger, an exact duplicate of her, but different in 
    some ways (especially attitude; the doppelganger looks especially 
    sinister). Gabe seems to understand, telling Adelaide he doesn't know 
    how she has held this in so long (And there's a reason for that!), 
    but he really comes to believe her when a family of four dressed in 
    red jumpsuits stand in the driveway of their beach house holding 
    hands, not speaking and not moving a muscle. While Adelaide calls the 
    police, Gabe politely asks them to go away, but he gets no answer. He 
    then grabs a baseball bat and tells them that he's not kidding, if 
    they don't go away, he's going to use the bat on them, but still no 
    answer or movement. Only when he tells them the police are on their 
    way, do they move quickly towards the house. It turns out the unknown 
    family of four are exact doppelgangers of Adelaide's family, except 
    for a few differences (Jason's double wears a mask, for reasons that 
    are made clear quickly). Only Adelaide's doppelganger can talk and 
    the others just grunt or groan loudly (Jason's double walks on all 
    fours, like a dog). Gabe's double uses the bat on his knee, disabling 
    Gabe and dragging him away to his boat, while Adelaide's doppelganger 
    explains why they are there. She tells Adelaide (in a raspy, hoarse 
    voice; a clue) that every living human being has a &quot;Shadow&quot; 
    that they are &quot;tethered&quot; to. For every good thing that 
    happens to a human being, something equally awful happens to their 
    Shadow (Adelaide's Shadow tells a terrifying story about what 
    happened to her when Adelaide gave birth to her two children. It 
    turned out quite differently and painfully for her Shadow, as both 
    her Shadow children are quite evil, which they will prove later in 
    the film). When Adelaide asks her Shadow who they are, she replies, 
    &quot;We are AMERICANS!&quot; She then tells Adelaide that it is now 
    the time for the &quot;Untethering&quot; and it turns out that the 
    Shadows are attacking and killing their human counterparts (and 
    anyone else who stands in their way) all over the world and when they 
    are done, they form a single line and hold hands, like some twisted 
    version of &quot;Hands Across America&quot; (tethering themselves 
    together, as it were). If you want to know why this is happening, you 
    better put on your thinking caps and start thinking hard, because 
    this film is ripe with symbolism, from all the Shadows wearing red 
    jump suits and unable to talk (except for Adelaide's Shadow, which is 
    a major clue), all Shadows carrying scissors as weapons, right down 
    to the Shadows living quarters (Hell?) being over-run with white, 
    fluffy bunny rabits! Even if you don't put on your thinking caps, 
    this film can still be enjoyed as horror film, kind of like a 
    modern-day version of <B><A HREF="invasion_of_the_body_snatchers_1956.htm">INVASION
     OF THE BODY SNATCHERS</A></B> (1956), but without the Communism 
    paranoia. That's not to say that there's not some humor in this film, 
    because there is plenty, but it's black as coal. One scene I really 
    laughed at is when Josh, wife Kitty and their two teenage daughters 
    are being murdered by their Shadows and a near-death Kitty yells out 
    to her Alexa-like A.I. device to &quot;Call the police!&quot; and it 
    starts playing NWA's &quot;Fuck The Police&quot; instead! Anyone with 
    an Alexa, Siri or other A.I. device can relate to that and I have to 
    say I laughed quite loudly! One thing I do have to admit: I did guess 
    the final twist in the film, but others may find it quite M. Night 
    Shyamalan-like in its execution (Clue: Why is it that only Adelaide's 
    Shadow has the gift of speech when none of the other Shadows do and 
    why does she talk in such a raspy voice?). For only a sophomore 
    effort, Director/writer Jordan Peele shows a deft hand behind the 
    camera, as it is beautifully filmed, quite shocking at times and full 
    of little filmic clues as to why this is happening (I like to think 
    of this film as a modern-day fable about the poor versus the rich. I 
    know that's not what is meant to be conveyed [or is it?], but it 
    works here.). It's not a total success (some scenes could have used 
    some trimming), but this is a perfect example of a horror film with a 
    message done right. I wait with baited breath for Jordan Peele's next 
    film. He's proving to be a modern-day Hitchcock or John Carpenter. We 
    all wear masks sometimes, don't we?;<A NAME="GunsAkimbo2019"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="guns_akimbo_2019.htm">GUNS AKIMBO</A></B> (2019) is the 
    return of New Zealand director/writer Jason Lei Howden, who gave us 
    the excellent <B><A HREF="#Deathgasm2015">DEATHGASM</A></B> (2015). 
    While not as good as that film (in my opinion), it is still a wild 
    treat for all action fans out there. It's fast-paced, bloody as hell 
    and really funny in spots, thanks to the talents of actors Daniel 
    Radcliffe, Samara Weaving and Ned Dennehy and the frenetic 
    cinematography of Stefan Ciupek, so if you liked to look of <B><A HREF="deathgasm_2015.htm">DEATHGASM</A></B>,
     you are bound to <A HREF="guns_akimbo_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/guns akimbo poster10c small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>like
     the look of this film, too. The basic story is about nobody Miles 
    (Radcliffe), who works as a computer programmer during the day for 
    one of those games you play on the phone, where it takes money to 
    progress in the game, sucking the cash out of players bit by bit (his 
    boss is also a giant dick) and at night he's a keyboard warrior, one 
    of those trolls that we all hate. Well, his keyboard antics bring out 
    the ire of criminal mastermind Riktor (Dennehy), who has developed an 
    underground fighting &quot;game&quot; where two people take on each 
    other with various deadly weapons (usually automatic rifles, rocket 
    and grenade launchers) and the one who survives wins. Only this game 
    is real, run by a computer program named &quot;Skizm&quot; and 
    there's no reversing the course of the game. Long story short, Riktor 
    kidnaps Miles, drills holes in his hands, bolts 50-shot automatic 
    pistols to his hands&nbsp; and attaches screws to his fingers to 
    screw them to the pistols' handles and triggers, thereby making 
    Mile's hands good for only one thing: shooting. When Miles wakes up 
    and discovers he can't use his hands, it leads to a bunch of comical 
    outings, including trying to take a pee, trying to put on pants and a 
    whole lotta other things where hands are needed. What Miles soon 
    finds out is that he is to battle the defending champion of Skizm, a 
    drug-sniffing, heavily tatted and body pierced young woman named Nix 
    (Weaving), who loves to kill. This leads to Miles trying desperately 
    to escape Nix's weapons fire and trying to reason with her with no 
    luck, that is, until he discovers who she truly is. I'm not going to 
    give away any more of the plot because this is a film best seen cold. 
    What I will tell you is this film is one wild set piece after 
    another, where people are murdered in a variety of bloody ways (what 
    happens to Mile's boss will make you smile), none of it hidden from 
    the viewer. Daniel Radcliffe is excellent as Miles, who at first is a 
    fish out of water, but, as the film progresses, he becomes someone we 
    all wish we could be, a man who just wants to live and appeals to 
    Nix's humanity (which she didn't know she had) to bring down Riktor 
    and his crew. Even though I like this film, I didn't love it the same 
    way as I did <B><A HREF="deathgasm_2015.htm#HeavyMetalApocalyps">DEATHGASM</A></B>.
     That film had something this film seems to be missing: it's too 
    self-aware; lacking a sense of the absurd. Don't get me wrong, 
    there's plenty of absurdity in this film, but some of it seems forced 
    and unnecessary (like Miles meeting a crack-smoking bum in an alley). 
    But it is still good enough to be put in this category. No doubt 
    about it, Jason Lei Howden is a talent to keep an eye on. I would 
    like to see him do something different in his next film, just to see 
    if he can handle a good story without all the crazy camera angles and 
    zippy editing both of his other films have. All-in-all, an 
    entertaining way to spend 97 minutes. (Available for free on Amazon 
    Prime at the time of this review).;<A NAME="ReadyOrNot2019"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="ready_or_not_2019.htm">READY OR NOT</A></B> (2019) 
    contains an excellent performance from Samara Weaving (see review for <B><A HREF="#GunsAkimbo2019">GUNS
     AKIMBO</A></B> [2019] directly above, which Ms. Weaving made 
    directly after starring in this) and she makes this film a worthwhile 
    and extremely bloody experience. The film opens in 1989 and we're at 
    the Le Domas mansion, where a wounded man is chasing Alex and Daniel 
    Le Domas, the young children of the extremely rich family, who have a 
    deadly secret. The wounded man catches up with Daniel and the kid 
    yells out, &quot;He's in here!&quot;, as the family, all wearing 
    masks, shoot two arrows in the wounded man's chest and drag him away. 
    Thirty years pass and we see the pretty Grace (Weaving) in a wedding 
    dress and about to get married to Alex (Mark O'Brien) at the Le Domas 
    mansion, where all the Le Domas family will attend, including drunk 
    brother Daniel (Adam Brody; <B><A HREF="jennifers_body_2009.htm">JENNIFER'S
     BODY</A></B> - 2009) and his wife Charity (Elyse Levesque), his 
    father Tony (Henry Czerny; <B><A HREF="fido_2006.htm">FIDO</A></B> - 
    2006) and mother Becky (a scene-stealing Andie MacDowell; <B><A HREF="hudson_hawk_1991.htm">HUDSON
     HAWK</A></B> - 1991), his Aunt Helene (Nicky Guadagni; <B><A HREF="cube_1997.htm">CUBE</A></B> 
    - 1997), his cocaine-addled sister Emilie (Melanie Scrofano; <B><A HREF="wolves_2013.htm">WOLVES</A></B> 
    - 2013), her husband Fitch Bradley (Kristian Bruun) and their two 
    young sons Georgie (Liam MacDonald) and Gabe (Ethan Tavares). At the 
    wedding, Grace notices Helene shooting nasty looks at her, as if she 
    disapproves of Grace and the marriage (Earlier, Grace tells Alex she 
    is marrying him purely for love and not the family's money. Charity, 
    on the other hand,<A HREF="ready_or_not_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ready or not poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    tells Grace that she married Daniel purely for the money!). After the 
    wedding is over, Grace and Alex are about to do the dirty, when Aunt 
    Helene appears through a secret door (it's the hired help entrance, 
    as they are not allowed to walk the hallways proper; the mansion is 
    full of secret tunnels that the hired help use, which are connected 
    to every room in the house) and interrupts them, saying they are both 
    expected to attend a meeting in the &quot;Play Room&quot; and 
    everyone else will also be there. It seems the rich Le Domas Family 
    made their fortune in the gaming industry and every new member of the 
    family must play a game to welcome them into the fold. Unfortunately, 
    the game Grace picks is &quot;Hide And Seek&quot;, the only game that 
    has a deadly outcome. Even though Alex loves Grace with all his 
    heart, he has no choice but to play the game against his wishes (He 
    tries to protect her, but family is everything), where Grace is to 
    hide in the mansion (all security cameras are turned off to make the 
    game &quot;fair&quot;) while the entire family hunts her down (with 
    weapons such as a shotgun, pistols, a crossbow and an ancient axe, 
    which Helene swings like a pro!) and then offer her as a human 
    sacrifice to the Devil in a satanic ritual. If Grace is still alive 
    at dawn, the Le Domas family will suffer a horrific fate at the hands 
    of their late patriarch Mr. Le Bail, who collects human souls. It 
    seems all the Le Domas Family sold their souls for riches and a life 
    of luxury and must do as Mr. Le Bail, a Satanist, decreed they must 
    do. (Another wealthy family also played the game and when the game 
    wasn't played correctly, the entire family died in a house fire, or 
    as Tony explains, &quot;That's what the media fed you&quot;, implying 
    that they died much more horribly at Satan's hands). The family gives 
    Grace a count to one hundred to hide and they they will try to find 
    her and end her life before dawn. That's all I'm going to explain 
    about the plot because this is a film that should be experienced 
    cold, as it is an effective horror comedy (most of the humor is of 
    the black variety, including many of the deaths). Directors Tyler 
    Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin are better known as members of 
    &quot;Radio Silence', the group that also directed and starred in the 
    episode &quot;10/31/98&quot; of the found footage film <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#VHS2012">VHS</A></B> 
    (2012), which happens to be that film's best episode. The blood in 
    this film flows rather freely and sometimes perversely, such as when 
    young Georgie finds Grace hiding in the barn and shoots her in the 
    hand, creating a huge bloody hole in it, and yells out, &quot;She's 
    in here!&quot;, before Grace punches the young boy squarely in the 
    face, knocking him out. (I actually applauded at this scene because 
    the brat deserved it. We usually don't see young snotty kids get 
    punched in the face by adults.). Grace then falls into the &quot;Goat 
    Pit&quot;, a basement area in the barn that hides all the corpses of 
    the family's previous victims (including the decayed corpse of the 
    wounded man we saw in the beginning of the film, two arrows still 
    protruding out his chest!). The wood ladder leading up to safety is 
    pretty rotten, but there is a nail at the top that can be used to 
    escape. In the film's most tense scene, Grace uses the nail by 
    slapping her wounded, bloody hand hole around the nail and slowly 
    pulls herself to safety as the ladder collapses from her weight (it's 
    actually very hard to watch, thanks to Samara Weaving's acting 
    talents). This film will have you laughing and cringing at the same 
    time, especially thanks to the butler, Stevens (John Ralston; <B><A HREF="pound_of_flesh_2015.htm">POUND
     OF FLESH</A></B> - 2015; in an amazingly evil performance), who 
    refuses to die, even when boiling water is thrown in his face and 
    other grisly things happen to him at Grace's hands (or, rather, 
    hand!). If you want to have a bloody good time watching a recent 
    horror film done right (not everything works here, but what does 
    outshines the mistakes), look no further than this film. The 
    unexpected explosive ending (which had me laughing hysterically) and 
    the final one word line of dialogue will stay with you long after the 
    movie ends. All films should be this entertaining.;</FONT></FONT></P>

     <B><A HREF="hunt_2019.htm">THE HUNT</A></B> (2019) has ingredients 
    in common with <B><A HREF="#ReadyOrNot2019">READY OR NOT</A></B> 
    (2019), as it deals with a group of rich people hunting down other 
    less fortunate people, with a strong female presence, but that's 
    pretty much where the similarity ends. This darkly humored tale (and 
    by 'dark', I mean 'pitch black') details a group of &quot;Elites&quot;
     hunting down what they consider &quot;Deplorables&quot; in Croatia, 
    where life is apparently cheap. The Elites fly twelve drugged 
    Americans they consider are second class citizens to somewhere in 
    Croatia, where they have set up an area to make them believe they are 
    still in America, including members of the Elite pretending to be 
    helpful. Actually only eleven people make it there as one of the Deplorables<A HREF="hunt_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/hunt 2019 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    wakes up on the plane and is killed by a pen impaled to his neck, 
    and, when he refuses to die, gets a high heel shoe planted in his 
    left eye (when the stewardess, or, excuse me, &quot;flight 
    attendant&quot;, who used her shoe to impale the man, pulls the shoe 
    from his eye socket, the eye is still attached to the heel!). He 
    still refuses to die and then has his throat cut (all in gory 
    close-up). When the eleven wake up in a field, all their mouths 
    gagged with a padlocked ball gag, they race to the center of the 
    field where a huge wooden crate sits. When the box is pried open, 
    inside is a live pig in a sweater (!), the key to the padlocks and 
    all sorts of deadly weapons. We are led to believe early on that a 
    certain group of Deplorables are going to be heroes of the film, but 
    when they are killed in various gory ways very quickly and 
    unexpectedly (blown up by a grenade, shot in the head, stepping on a 
    land mine and riddled with arrows, all leaving nothing to the 
    imagination), we are then led to believe that three other Deplorables 
    are going to be heroes, but when they run into a gas 
    station/convenience store run by a couple of married hicks, Ma &amp; 
    Pa (played hilariously by Amy Madigan and Reed Birney), and ask where 
    they are, they are told they are in Arkansas. Ma and Pa then kill all 
    three of the Deplorables with a sawed-off shotgun and place their 
    bodies in the store's freezer (and quickly quit talking like country 
    bumpkins!). They report back to their fellow Elites that three more 
    Inferiors are dead. Then entering the Store a short time later is the 
    real heroine of the film, Crystal (Betty Gilpin, in a role that 
    should have won her many awards, but more on that later), who orders 
    a pack of cigarettes from Ma and when she doesn't get the right 
    amount of change back, knows she isn't in Arkansas, grabs the 
    sawed-off from Ma and guns down both Ma &amp; Pa! The no-nonsense 
    Crystal begrudgingly joins forces with the only other surviving 
    Deplorable, Don (Wayne Duvall), who we find out runs a conspiracy 
    theory podcast that has mentioned &quot;Manorgate&quot; many times. 
    Manorgate is supposedly a long-standing <B><A HREF="most_dangerous_game_1932.htm">MOST
     DANGEROUS GAME</A></B>-like activity where rich people hunt down 
    poor people just for the fun of it. Needless to say, he doesn't last 
    very long in this film (even though we discover later in the film 
    that he was correct in calling a group of Mexican illegal aliens in a 
    train car as nothing but &quot;actors&quot; playing their roles to 
    get them believe they are still in America). Crystal is a force to 
    reckon with, as she is handy with both knives and guns and knows she 
    can't trust anyone (She runs over a diplomat's head with his own car 
    when she discovers he is working with the Elites). The head of the 
    Elites, the so-far unseen Athena, is getting slack from the other 
    Elites for allowing Crystal to be one of the hunted, especially as 
    she single-handidly kills a group of them hiding out in an 
    underground bunker, a scene so violent and funny at the same time it 
    must be seen to be believed! When we finally meet Athena (played to 
    perfection by Hilary Swank) in the finale, she and Crystal get into a 
    knock-down, drag-out fight (very painful and beautiful to watch), 
    especially since we find out that Manorgate never was a real thing at 
    all until this year, brought on by the twelve people chosen as 
    Deplorables who made the conspiracy theory seem like a real thing on 
    the Internet! Crystal also informs Athena that she never heard of 
    Manorgate until being taken prisoner, as Athena and her crew 
    kidnapped the wrong Crystal! Using nearly every item in the house as 
    a weapon, Crystal (a veteran of the war in Afghanistan) kills Athena 
    (best you discover how by watching the film), eats Athena's 
    specially-made grill cheese sandwich, dresses in Athena's expensive 
    clothes, hops on the waiting corporate jet (surprising the crew) and 
    delivers one hell of a comment that closes out the film. This 
    wonderful film, basically a diatribe against Trump's America, 
    surprises in ways you don't expect, always delivering a left when you 
    were expecting a right. The unexpected twists and turns, especially 
    in the first third of the film, keeps the viewers on their toes. 
    Films don't usually do that any more and we are all poorer for it. 
    The film also has two important flashbacks towards the finale 
    revealing the real reason why the Deplorables are being hunted down, 
    both from Athena and Crystal's point-of-view. This film was also 
    cursed from the start. It was supposed to premiere in theaters in 
    September 2019, but a series of real-life mass shootings in the U.S. 
    delayed the film's theatrical premiere until March 2020, the same 
    week the Covid-19 Pandemic forced the closure of all movie theaters, 
    so this film didn't get many viewers. Thankfully, we can watch it 
    streaming (or on HBOMax, where I saw it) on our own screens and enjoy 
    all the violence and black humor. Director/Executive Producer Craig 
    Zobel (<B><A HREF="compliance_2012.htm">COMPLIANCE</A></B> - 2012) 
    and Screenwriters/Executive Producers Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelhof 
    (both graduates of HBO's <B><A HREF="leftovers_tv_series_2014.htm">THE
     LEFTOVERS</A></B> [2014-2017]) have fashioned a film that can either 
    be taken as a straight-ahead bloody actioner or a parable on Trump's 
    only term as President, with the Elite being his rich friends and the 
    Deplorables (besides Crystal) as the uneducated Trumpsters who 
    believe everything that comes out of Trump's piehole and then spread 
    the lies on the Internet, infecting everyone like them (the Elite are 
    afraid of people believing this lie and decide to make Manorgate real 
    because they believe the lie will destroy their lives and careers, so 
    they kidnapped the people they believe who spread this lie the most 
    on the Internet). I would go as far as to say that if Trump did win a 
    second term as President, outings such as Manorgate may have become 
    commonplace. Please people, think for yourselves and don't let this 
    film become a documentary! Political rant over. This film also makes 
    many references to George Orwell's novel &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. The 
    pig (who doesn't survive the slaughter) is named &quot;Orwell&quot;, 
    many of the Deplorables are given nicknames straight from the animals 
    in the novel, Athena calls Crystal &quot;Snowball&quot; several times 
    and there are several verbatim quotes from the novel strewn 
    throughout the film. Crystal also tells a very graphic version of 
    &quot;The Hare and the Tortoise&quot; fairy tale (replacing the hare 
    with a jackrabbit and the tortoise with a box turtle) to Athena that 
    becomes very meaningful to the results of what is happening in the 
    film. Also featuring Emma Roberts, Ike Barinholtz, Ethan Suplee, 
    Chris Berry, Glenn Howerton, Sturgill Simpson and Kate Nowlin as the 
    Deplorables who meet quick deaths. Highly Recommended.;</FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">&nbsp;

    town, Joanne Sharp (Jolene Anderson), who is about to retire from her 
    job to move to the &quot;big city&quot; with her teenage daughter, 
    Samantha (Stef Dawson), must contend with animals dying horrible 
    deaths and infecting the majority of the townspeople with an alien 
    organism, forcing them to stand motionless in the street (really 
    eerie) and then trying to kill the uninfected. There is also a huge 
    alien monster, who seems to be working on the side of the uninfected, 
    grabbing the infected and killing them (later on we see the alien 
    burning their bodies). There is also a huge dust storm that envelopes 
    all the roads out of town, making it impossible for anyone to escape 
    or anyone to enter, so the uninfected, including Joanne's deputy, 
    Paul (Harry Greenwood), must stop the infected from killing the 
    uninfected (One infected father kills his young son and leaves his 
    torn-apart body in a public bathroom. When Joanne asks him why he did 
    it, the father says he was fully aware he was killing his son, but he 
    couldn't stop himself. He then begs Joanne to kill him before he 
    kills someone else.). While that is basically the entire film in a 
    nutshell, director/screenwriter Sandra Sciberras fills the film with 
    weird and creepy scenes of the infected standing motionless in the 
    streets, but when they find a victim to kill, they let out a vicious 
    scream and their mouths get unusually large, running at speeds no 
    human could ever hope to achieve, also doing acrobatics that defy the 
    laws of physics. It's also refreshing that the alien monster is on 
    our side for a change, but we don't know it until the final minutes 
    of the film. It's apparent it doesn't want the infection to spread 
    across the globe, or it is just covering its tracks. Either way, it's 
    a really good CGI creation that is used sparingly. We always hear it 
    and watch its tentacles grabbing the infected, but very rarely see it 
    until the final twenty minutes. This is nothing Earth-shattering, 
    just a good, old-fashioned monster flick that incorporates modern 
    conveniences into the plot. This time, there is a valid reason why 
    cell phones don't work in the town. Catch it if you can.;<A NAME="Prodigy2019"></A> 
    In the mood for a good killer kid movie? Then <B><A HREF="prodigy_2019.htm">THE
     PRODIGY</A></B> (2019) is the film for you. Not only is there an 
    excellent story, this film also contains some very good acting, 
    especially from child actor Jackson Robert Scott. The film opens with 
    a young woman escaping from a house and running away into the woods. 
    When she makes it to a road, she is nearly run over by another woman 
    in a car. She stops the car and the young woman raises her right arm, 
    showing nothing but a stump, screaming out, &quot;He took my hand! HE 
    TOOK MY HAND!&quot; We then switch to a very pregnant Sarah Blume 
    (Taylor Schilling), as she wakes up husband John (Peter Mooney) to 
    tell him the baby is coming early. John and Sarah go to the hospital 
    and she delivers a baby boy that they name Miles. At the same time 
    Sarah is delivering her baby, we see a SWAT team invade the house of 
    a serial killer named Edward Scarka (Paul Fauteux), the man who kept 
    the young woman captive. Scarka sees the SWAT team coming, so he runs

    of bullets and then discover what was in his hand. It wasn't a gun, 
    it was the young woman's dismembered hand! Scarka's MO was removing 
    the hands of his victims and hanging them on his wall!. What does 
    this have to do with Sarah's pregnancy, you may ask? You'll have to 
    watch the film to discover that, but I will tell you this: Miles 
    turns out to be a child prodigy. He begins talking at six months of 
    age, begins solving complex problems at the age of two and begins 
    humming a strange tune and speaking in a foreign language, a language 
    his parents never spoke. An 8-year-old Miles (Jackson Robert Scott; <B><A HREF="it_2017.htm">IT</A></B> 
    - 2017) also has problems around other children. He is put in a 
    school for gifted children and ends up beating one child student 
    nearly to death with a pipe wrench, when he partners up with a female 
    student Miles wanted as a partner. One night, Sarah hears Miles 
    talking in a foreign language in his sleep and tapes him. This will 
    prove important in properly diagnosing Miles' problems. Miles also 
    kills the family dog with a pair of garden shears and hides the body 
    in the basement. When Miles is taken to psychiatrist Dr. Strasser 
    (Paula Boudreau), Sarah hands her the tape recording of Miles talking 
    in a foreign language. Dr. Strasser listens to the tape and contacts 
    a specialist named Arthur Jacobson (the excellent Colm Feore; <B><A HREF="chronicles_of_riddick_2004.htm">THE
     CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK</A></B> - 2004), a specialist in a field I 
    cannot say without spoiling the plot, who hypnotizes Miles and 
    discovers the shocking truth, which he is not able to tell Sarah, 
    because Miles blackmails him in a way you must see and hear to 
    believe (I cannot believe an 8-year-old child could say such things 
    in films, but what he says is really shocking!). Miles' actions 
    causes a rift between John and Sarah, which leads to a conclusion 
    that is rather disappointing, but still surprising. This is like a 
    modern retelling of <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Mikey">MIKEY</A></B> 
    (1991) and <B><A HREF="good_son_1992.htm">THE GOOD SON</A></B> 
    (1992), but with a supernatural twist. There are two 
    jump-out-of-your-seat moments, which you will know as soon as they 
    happen. Have your heart medication ready. If you don't use any, you 
    may need some before this film ends. Jackson Robert Scott is simply 
    terrifying as Miles. He has a stare that would send shivers down the 
    spine of the Pope and make you never want to have children (If you 
    already have some, you may want to lock your bedroom door at night!).

    doesn't make good slasher films any more? Then let me point you to <B><A HREF="trick_2019.htm">TRICK</A></B> 
    (2019), one of the most bloody and fast-paced slasher films you are 
    likely to see. And it's a Halloween slasher flick to boot! In a small 
    New York town, during a Halloween party in 2015, a bunch of teens are 
    playing &quot;Spin The Blade&quot;, which works the same way as 
    &quot;Spin The Bottle&quot;, where a knife is spun and whomever the 
    blade points to, the spinner has to kiss. When Patrick 
    &quot;Trick&quot; Weaver (Thom Niemann) spins the blade and it points 
    to a male member of the game, the other players egg Trick on the kiss 
    the boy, but when it looks like he is about to, Trick picks up the 
    blade and begins slaughtering everyone at the party, not just the 
    ones playing the game (it's quite gory). Trick is stopped by 
    partygoer Cheryl (Kristina Reyes), who impales Trick with a fireplace 
    poker, sending him to the hospital. At the hospital, town Sheriff 
    Lisa Jayne (Ellen Adair) meets Detective Mike Denver (Omar Epps; the 
    TV Series <B><A HREF="house_md_tv.htm">HOUSE</A></B> [2004 - 2012]), 
    an F.B.I. agent put in charge of the case. Detective Denver goes to 
    interrogate Trick in his hospital bed (both his hands are handcuffed 
    to the railings of his hospital bed), over the objections of hospital 
    physician Dr. Steven (Jamie Kennedy; <B><A HREF="scream_1997.htm">SCREAM</A></B> 
    - 1996), resulting in Trick attacking Detective Denver and trying to 
    escape, concluding with Mike and Lisa pumping five bullets into 
    Trick's body as he crashes through a second floor window and falls to 
    the <A HREF="trick_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/trick 2019 amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>pavement
     below. When Mike and Lisa run downstairs to examine Trick's body, 
    it's not there, but there is a blood trail leading to a nearby river, 
    Lisa telling Mike that there's no way he can survive the freezing 
    temperature of the water, especially after getting shot five times 
    and falling twenty feet onto a hard surface. Mike, on the other hand, 
    has doubts, which will be proven true in a year. When doing a 
    background check on Patrick Weaver, all Mike and Lisa come up with is 
    a big dead end, no photos, no known mother and father and no history 
    at all, like he never existed and he can be anybody. At a 2016 
    Halloween party in a nearby New York town, another massacre occurs, 
    the killer unknown, but he was holding a knife that had the name 
    &quot;Trick&quot; on it. Mike thinks Trick has returned, but 
    everyone, including his boss and Lisa, think it is a copycat, saying 
    that there's no way Trick survived that night a year ago, even though 
    his dead body was never found. Mike is the only one who believes 
    Trick is still alive. When the same type of massacre occurs in other 
    small New York towns, during Halloween parties in 2017 and 2018 
    (including a gory decapitation death of Mike's boss, Chief Gunn [Tony 
    Mitchell], which puts any Rube Goldberg-like death in the <B><A HREF="saw_franchise_2004-2010.htm">SAW</A></B><A HREF="saw_franchise_2004-2010.htm"> Franchise</A> 
    [2004 - 2007] to shame in its simplicity!), Lisa starts to believe 
    Trick is still alive, but is he really? This killer, who dresses like 
    Trick, seems to be supernatural, such as appearing in two places at 
    once and avoiding capture by moving like The Flash. In other words, 
    Trick is very quick, quicker than any human should be.. Even bullets 
    can't stop him. When Mike figures out that Trick has returned to kill 
    anyone at the Halloween party in 2015 that is still alive, both he 
    and Lisa must protect Cheryl, whose father apparently tried to commit 
    suicide by jumping off the roof of his business, but he survived and 
    is now a paraplegic in a hospital bed in the same hospital where 
    Trick escaped back in 2015. Can they stop Trick once and for all? Let 
    me just say this: There is non-stop death and bloodshed in this film 
    from beginning to end, not giving the viewer a chance to catch their 
    breath. This rollicking gorefest, which was released Unrated to a few 
    theaters late in October 2019, was a joy to watch, and, even though I 
    guessed the final reveal (it's slyly referred to in this review), 
    it's a good watch for every slasher fan out there. Director Patrick 
    Lussier (<B><A HREF="dracula_2000_1999.htm">DRACULA 2000</A></B> -

    Farmer (<B><A HREF="jason_x_2001.htm">JASON X</A></B> - 2001, and all 
    the other films I just mentioned [except for the Dracula franchise]), 
    has fashioned a film that comes at you so fast and furiously, you 
    won't have time to notice all the holes in the story until long after 
    the film is over. Yet this film is full of memorable, gory deaths, 
    including one against one of Lisa's female deputies at a shipyard, 
    which you will have to experience for yourself. This is a good old 
    straight-from-the-Eighties slasher flick, that was, thankfully, never 
    submitted to the MPAA for a rating. If it were, the film would 
    probably be a thirty minute short! You actually can feel the pain 
    every time Trick uses his knife against his victims (especially 
    during the pain-filled finale, which will have you grimacing from all 
    the blade impalements). The ending may be a little too pat for some 
    people, but I was able to overlook it, as this was one wild ride that 
    deserves a sequel and will probably get one if there is justice in 
    this world. It was also nice to see Tom Atkins (<B><A HREF="halloween_3_season_of_the_witch_1982.htm">HALLOWEEN

     DTV Genre Films Part 27 (continued):<A NAME="Glass2019"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="glass_2019.htm">GLASS</A></B> (2019) is director/writer 
    M. Night Shyamalan's sequel to his <B><A HREF="unbreakable_2000.htm">UNBREAKABLE</A></B> 
    (2000) and <B><A HREF="#Split2016">SPLIT</A></B> (2016). It's also 
    one of the most accomplished films of his career. The real star of 
    this film is James McAvoy, who returns from the 2016 film as Kevin 
    Wendell Crumb, the man with 24 personalities, one of them being 
    &quot;The Beast&quot;, who has been kidnapping young women in 
    Philadelphia and mutilating them. Bruce Willis returns as David Dunn, 
    the man who was the only survivor of a train wreck and now believes 
    he is super strong and indestructible (or &quot;unbreakable&quot;). 
    He takes &quot;walks' through the Philadelphia streets looking for 
    the killer with the help of his son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark, who 
    returns from the 2000 film), who keeps in contact with his father by 
    radio transmission. Long story short, David finds Kevin, who turns 
    into The Beast, and begins to battle him, but they are stopped short 
    of a full-on assault by Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson; a regular on 
    TV's <B><A HREF="american_horror_story_tv_series_2011.htm">AMERICAN 
    HORROR STORY</A></B>) and the Philadelphia police force. It seems Dr. 
    Staple knows all about David and Kevin, including their weaknesses, 
    and puts them in separate cells in an insane asylum, the same asylum 
    Elijah Price, a.k.a. &quot;Mr. Glass&quot; (Samuel L. Jackson), has 
    spent the last twenty years. Dr. Staple doesn't believe in comic book 
    heroes or villains, telling David, Kevin and<A HREF="glass_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/glass 2019 poster6a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    Elija that they have brain injuries which make them believe they are 
    heroes and villains, but like Elija says, &quot;Just because there 
    are valid scientific explanations, it doesn't make them correct.&quot;
     David is unable to escape from his cell because when he tries to 
    escape, he is sprayed with water, which is his kryptonite. The same 
    thing with Kevin, as he is hit with a bright light, which is his 
    kryptonite. For the past twenty years, Elijah has been drugged to the 
    gills to keep him in line. Elijah may be the smartest man in the 
    world, his brain a total weapon, and the only way to keep him from 
    using it is to keep him drugged with powerful tranquilizers. Also 
    returning from both previous films are Mrs. Price (Charlayne 
    Woodard), Elijah's mother and Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy), who was 
    Kevin's last female captive in the 2016 film (He let her go because 
    he liked her and she had the same tragic family life he had when they 
    were children). As you can probably guess, all three escape from the 
    asylum, but it is what happens after the escape that is truly 
    phenomenal. I'm not going to tell you, except to say that M. Night 
    Shyamalan throws not only one surprise finale, but also a surprise of 
    the surprise! Actually, the film is full of little surprises, 
    including how Kevin is related to David and Elijah (not by blood, but 
    by circumstances) and how comic books are closer to the truth than we 
    realize. The ending is great and leaves the franchise open for 
    another sequel, but this one will have to go in a totallly different 
    direction (If I told you why, it would ruin the film for you). Let's 
    just say it's another trio who will carry the comic book torch. 
    Everyone in the film is fantastic, especially James McAvoy, who 
    switches his characters with such ease, you will actually believe he 
    has 24 different personalities and, unlike the 2016 film, he actually 
    portrays most of them here (there's a scene in the middle of the film 
    where an intern hits him with the bright light every few seconds and 
    he displays most of his personalities in a true tour de force 
    performance). He is amazing and deserves awards for his turn(s) here, 
    but he won't get them because a film of this caliber never gets 
    nominated for awards, which is a crying shame, as McAvoy also 
    physically transforms for every personality, especially as The Beast 
    and he's quite imposing. The film is a little long at 129 minutes, 
    but that's just a small gripe, as everyone gets their turn to shine, 
    even those in minor roles (like the asylum's interns). I 
    wholeheartedly recommend this film and it's nice to see M. Night 
    Shyamalan returning to his roots. This is a film where you will be 
    watching the magician's right hand while his left one is throwing you 
    a whammy. That's the best way to describe Mr. Glass, as in the end he 
    tells his mother he didn't want a &quot;hero vs. villian&quot; 
    ending, but a whole new origin story. That's what this film delivers 
    in the most satisfying way. See it! For an even more satisfying 
    experience, watch all three films back-to-back (which is what I did) 
    and you'll keep picking up certain things that you will miss if you 
    haven't seen the previous two films recently (such as the clover 
    tattoos). It's the closest you'll get to the perfect trilogy.;<A NAME="KnivesOut2019"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="knives_out_2019.htm">KNIVES OUT</A></B> (2019) is a 
    near-perfect old-fashioned murder mystery, with equal measures of 
    comedy, edge-of-your-seat thrills and fantastic acting and dialogue, 
    all wrapped in a very fast-moving 130 minutes. When family patriarch 
    Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), a best-<A HREF="knives_out_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/knives out poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>selling
     author of mystery novels, is found dead on the night of his 85th 
    birthday, his fucked-up family becomes the prime suspects, all of 
    them having a reason to kill him. The family includes real estate 
    magnate Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis), Harlan's daughter, her cheating 
    husband Richard (Don Johnson), and their trust fund son Ransom (Chris 
    Evans), as well as New Age guru daughter Joni (Toni Collette), her 
    daughter Meg (Katherine Langford) and also son Walt (Michael 
    Shannon), who runs his father's publishing company, his wife Donna 
    (Riki Lindhome), and their internet-obsessed son Jacob (Jaeden 
    Martell), whose eyes are attached to his cell phone. Also on hand for 
    all the madness is Harlan's fulltime nurse Marta Cabrera (an 
    excellent Ana de Armas), who can't lie without puking her guts out. 
    Oh, and I forgot to mention Harlan's ancient mother Greatnana Wanetta 
    (K Callan), who acts like a doorstop, yet she's not as senile as she 
    seems. Investigating Harlan's death, which looks like a suicide, is 
    Lieutenant Elliott (LaKeith Stanfield) and Trooper Wagner (Noah 
    Segan), with an assist from famous private detective Benoit Blanc (an 
    amazing Daniel Craig), who was hired to look into Harlan's death by 
    someone who wishes to remain anonymous, even to him, but they gave 
    him an envelope stuffed with cash, so he's going to do his best to 
    find out if it was a murder or a suicide. Almost immediately, we see 
    how Harlan actually died, but is it the entire story? Of course not, 
    because if it was, the film would end right there. I'm not going to 
    get into specifics because this is a film that should be watched 
    cold, without knowing anything. Like all good mysteries, the clues 
    are there, but only if you pay close attention. The cast is 
    fantastic, the dialogue pricelesss (Just hearing Chris Evans point at 
    everyone and say, &quot;You can eat shit&quot; is worth the price of 
    admission!) and the mystery is well thought out, making this film a 
    real treat for fans of mystery films, especially those from the pen 
    of Agatha Christie (this is not one of her films, although the 
    caliber of the cast reminds me of <B><A HREF="murder_on_the_orient_express_1974.htm">MURDER
     ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</A></B> [1974]). Director/screenwriter Rian 
    Johnson (<B><A HREF="looper_2012.htm">LOOPER</A></B> - 2012) has 
    delivered a delicious film full of bright spots, as everyone in the 
    cast gets their turn to shine. I'm going to cut this review short by 
    saying if you are a mystery fan, this is one film you should not 
    overlook. It got great reviews because it is a great film. See it!;<A NAME="ButtBoy2019"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="butt_boy_2019.htm">BUTT BOY</A></B> (2019) may not be 
    for everyone, as it is strangely acted (almost like everyone never 
    took acting lessons, never acted before or are from another 
    dimension!), leisurely paced and practically bloodless through most 
    of the film, but those looking for a lot of weirdness are bound to be 
    rewarded in spades. Chip Gutchell (director/co-writer/co-music 
    composer Tyler Cornack) is living a boring and uneventful life. One 
    of his co-workers at the computer business he works at (an ITT clone) 
    gets promoted before him, he has a loveless marriage to his wife Anne 
    (Shelby Dash), who would rather go out with<A HREF="butt_boy_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/butt boy poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    her girlfriends than spend time with him and their new baby boy 
    Marty, and his life is ho-hum taken to the tenth power. Chip is also 
    a closet alcoholic. When he goes to a doctor for a medical check-up, 
    the doctor gives him an anal exam and Chip discovers that he likes 
    the feeling of a hand up his ass; it gives him sexual pleasure. While 
    trying to make love to Anne, he wants her to put her fingers up his 
    ass, but she refuses to do so, telling him that it is disgusting and 
    she is done with the lovemaking, leaving their bed.&nbsp; Chip 
    discovers he can pleasure himself by sticking objects up his ass, 
    such as game pieces, the TV's remote control and other objects, such 
    as dishes and other chinaware. Once they go up his ass, they never 
    come out! It gets so exciting for Chip, that the next object to go up 
    his butthole is the family dog! We then see Anne and Chip putting up 
    missing dog flyers all over town and when they are at a park, Chip 
    sees a young baby boy and his mother having a picnic, so Chip tells 
    Anne he will put up the rest of the flyers and for her to go home and 
    get some rest. The next thing we see is the police knocking on Chip's 
    door, asking him and Anne if they saw anyone strange at the park, as 
    they know they were there when a baby boy disappeared. Chip even 
    joins in for the search for the baby boy, even though he is guilty of 
    shoving the baby up the middle of his ass cheeks (We never see him 
    doing any of these things, but it is implied in such a way that there 
    can be no other explanation). We then see Chip getting a case of the 
    guilts and trying to commit suicide by hanging himself in the garage, 
    but it seems he can't die because putting things up his butt makes 
    him stronger and nearly unkillable! Nine years pass and we are 
    introduced to a police detective named Russel B. Fox (Tyler Rice; who 
    always looks like he is constipated!) as he drives to an AA meeting 
    for the first time; he is an alcoholic trying to straighten out his 
    life. At the meeting, he is given a sponsor to guide him off the 
    sauce. That sponsor is none other than Chip, who has been clean for 
    years (he hasn't put anything up his ass since nearly being caught by 
    the police for shoving the baby up his hindquarters). Chip and 
    Detective Fox have an introductary meal to get to know each other, 
    but it doesn't go too well for either of them. After the meal, we see 
    Detective Fox climb a tree and peep on a woman and her black 
    boyfriend and Chip gets the urge to shove thing up his ass 
    again.&nbsp; Russel goes to his next AA meeting the following week 
    and asks the man running the meeting if he has talked to Chip, as he 
    doesn't return any of the phone calls he makes to him and he's not 
    being a good sponsor. He is told no, as a matter of fact, Chip hasn't 
    been to any meetings the past week, which is unlike him because he 
    never misses a meeting. Chip, who still works at the same boring job 
    as the IT administrator, is told that this Friday is &quot;bring your 
    child to work day&quot;, so he goes home to his same loveless wife 
    Anne and their now nine-year-old son Marty (Tyler Dryden) and eat 
    another boring meal together. When Friday arrives, we see Marty 
    sitting next to Chip as he explains what he does for a living, which 
    Marty finds extremely boring. Chip's boss decides to play a game of 
    Hide And Seek with his employees' kids and the child of a Chinese 
    worker hides under Chip's desk. Chip finds it a temptation too 
    difficult to pass up and the police are called in to investigate the 
    case of a missing child. The detective in charge of the case? That's 
    right, it's Detective Russel B. Fox! Russel becomes highly suspicious 
    of Chip when he learns that all of the security camera footage in the 
    business is missing and only Chip knows how to work the device since 
    he is the only IT administrator. Chip, of course, denies it, but 
    Russel is adamant to his Chief (Brad Potts) that Chip is the guilty 
    party and based on evidence he finds under Chip's desk (a small piece 
    of dooky with a human hair in it) and following Chip as he takes&nbsp;
     a cat into a tunnel and then disappears, he believes that Chip is 
    killing people by shoving them up his ass. The Chief thinks Russel is 
    insane (what he says to Russel is so funny, I'll leave it for you to 
    discover!) and what happens next is pushing the believability factor 
    to eleven. Russel visits Chip's house for dinner (Anne wants to meet 
    him) and just as he is leaving, he tells Chip he has a long way to 
    drive and he needs to take a shit right now and asks to use his 
    bathroom. Chip, who hid the disc containing the security camera 
    footage in&nbsp; the bathroom, reluctantly lets Russel use it, but 
    immediately regrets it and tries to open the locked door, finally 
    forcing it open, only to discover Russel with his gun drawn, the disc 
    in his other hand. Russel leaves&nbsp; the house and drives away, 
    only for Chip to follow him in his car. Things get nasty when Russel 
    stops his car and punches Chip silly until his face is all bloody. 
    Russel gets back in his car, only for all the windows in his car to 
    implode and when he looks into his car door's driver side mirror, he 
    sees Chip's naked ass facing him, the suction coming out of his blow 
    hole so strong that the disc comes flying out of the car and into 
    Chip's ass! Russel has no other choice but to drive away before he 
    becomes a victim of Chip's hungry posterior. Chip ends up in the 
    hospital and Russel is fired from his job for beating Chip to a 
    pulp.&nbsp; Russel begins drinking again and spies on the same woman 
    he peeped on in the tree. It turns out he use to know the woman and 
    her black boyfriend, who may or may not be the woman's husband. Chip 
    professes to Anne that he wants to turn his life around and tells her 
    he wants to be a loving husband again and put romance back into their 
    relationship. He takes his Marty to a lazer tag game for his birthday 
    and once they are playing the game in near drkness with a bunch of 
    other children, Russel <A HREF="butt_boy_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/butt boy poster14a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>appears
     with his gun drawn and shoots Chip in the leg, but Chip gets the 
    upper hand and sucks Russel up his corn hole. We then see Chip being 
    celebrated as a hero for stopping a rogue cop from shooting innocent 
    children, the Chief promising Chip that Russel will be found and 
    arrested. We then discover that everything that Chip shoves up his 
    poop chute doesn't disappear, it actually remains in some sort of 
    tunnel system in Chip's body and Russel, the missing child from work, 
    his pet dog and the baby boy Chip swallowed up his ass nine years ago 
    are alive and they don't age! Russel promises the missing Chinese boy 
    that he will discover a way out of Chip's ass and he finds a way to 
    make some of the objects and the dog exit out of Chip's dung hole. 
    But can he find a way for himself and the other boys to get out of 
    this messy third-eyed situation? That, my friends is left for you to 
    discover. needless to say, it will be something you won't forget for 
    a long, long time (I will tell you this: the baby boy that 
    disappeared nine years ago is actually Russel's son!). I heard about 
    this film early in 2020, but completely forgot about it until Amazon 
    Prime offered it free to members to watch streaming. I must admit 
    that I almost turned it off within the first fifteen minutes because 
    the film moved at a snail's pace, but I am here to tell you to stick 
    with it. The acting here seems to came from some alternate Earth, as 
    I doubt you have ever seen anything like it before. It takes some 
    getting used to, but once you do, I guarantee you will enjoy the 
    strange ride. While we never see much of anything being shoved up 
    Chip's fart hole (Thank God!), it is implied in such a way (such as 
    Chip moaning in sexual pleasure) that it leaves no doubt in your 
    mind. The finale is really explosive (both literally and 
    figuratively) and will leave you howling with laughter and completely 
    disgusted at the same time. That's not an easy thing to do, so if you 
    want to see a completely independent film done right and with a lot 
    of imagination, don't let this one pass you by. It's not for 
    everyone, but those that are into weird and totally offbeat films are 
    bound to love this.;<A NAME="ArtOfTheDead2019"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp; After 
    the disasterous and unfunny (but bloody) <B><A HREF="#BusPartyToHell2018">BUS
     PARTY TO HELL</A></B> (2018), director/screenwriter Rolfe Kanefsky 
    returns with the colorful (and bloody) horror film <B><A HREF="art_of_the_dead_2019.htm">ART
     OF THE DEAD</A></B> (2019). and while not everyone's cup of tea, I 
    must say I did enjoy it, even though the plot uses the same devices 
    as <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DevilsNightmare1971">THE DEVIL'S NIGHTMARE</A></B> 
    (1971), <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Redeemer 1976">THE REDEEMER</A></B> 
    (1976), <B><A HREF="se7en_1995.htm">SE7EN</A></B> (1995) and other 
    genre films throughout the years. Yes, this film is based on the 
    religious themes of &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot;, where seven 
    paintings by a cursed artist each represent one of the seven sins. 
    The film opens with Douglas Winter (Richard Grieco; <B><A HREF="#AttackUnknown2020">ATTACK
     OF THE UNKNOWN</A></B> - 2020; in an extended cameo), returning home 
    with the final painting of the &quot;Sinsation Collection&quot; (he 
    already has the other six), a colorful painting of a lion staring at 
    whomever views it (it represents Wrath and is the dominant force of 
    the seven paintings). Douglas wants his family to come and see the 
    painting, but whenever he talks to them, they refuse to answer, like 
    he's not even there. He returns to the room with the paintings and 
    blames his family for being jealous of his success and when he turns 
    around, he is covered in blood from head to toe. He sees himself in 
    the mirror and runs to warn his family, but they are all dead, sliced 
    to death by Douglas with a butcher knife (We will see him do the deed 
    in a<A HREF="art_of_the_dead_2019.htm"><IMG SRC="images/art of the dead poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    flashback later in the film), which he doesn't remember doing. He 
    grabs a shotgun and blames the paintings for making him murder his 
    family. He aims the shotgun at the Wrath painting, but an invisible 
    force grabs the shotgun out of his hands and we then see the lion now 
    has the shotgun! A pull of the trigger by the lion (!) kills Douglas 
    and we are then transported to an art auction run by Tess Barryman 
    (Tara Reid; <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm#Charlie'sFarm2014">CHARLIE'S
     FARM</A></B> - 2014; in another extended cameo), as she is about to 
    auction off the entire Sinsation Collection, not individually, but as 
    a set. Each painting depicts a certain animal (Lion = Wrath; Toads = 
    Greed; Goat = Lust; Peacock = Envy; Snails = Sloth; Snake = Pride; 
    Pig = Gluttony)&nbsp; Rich husband Dylan Wilson (Lukas Hassel; 
    Kanefsky's <B><A HREF="black_room_2017.htm">THE BLACK ROOM</A></B> - 
    2017) buys the collection for his wife Gina (Jessica Morris; <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm#Venom2011">VENOM</A></B> 
    - 2011) for half a million dollars. Also in the audience is Gregory 
    Mendale (Robart Donavan; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Final Examination">FINAL
     EXAMINATION</A></B> - 2002), an ex-priest whose left eye is dead and 
    white, who warns Dylan and Gina not to hang the paintings in their 
    home because it will turn out to be deadly. He tells them that they 
    were painted by late 18th Century artist Dorian Wilde (a takeoff of 
    Oscar Wilde's novel 'Dorian Gray') who made a pact with the Devil for 
    immortality if he painted the Seven Deadly Sins. Dorian then 
    disappeared and the paintings passed on from owner to owner, always 
    ending in death (A flashback shows Father Gregory's church being 
    donated the Pride painting and the snake (who slithers out of the 
    painting via some pretty good CGI) takes over his mind, showing him 
    what life would look like if he weren't a priest, but the good Father 
    is able to beat the snake's influence by stabbing himself in his left 
    eye with his crucifix necklace while quoting that old biblical 
    standby, &quot;If thine eye offends thee, pluck it out&quot;!). 
    Gregory says that it is best if they burn the paintings and stop the 
    evil from claiming any more victims, but they ignore him when Tess 
    orders the guards to throw Gregory out of the gallery. Tess tells 
    Dylan and Gina that the paintings will be delivered to their house 
    tomorrow afternoon. We then see a two man crew carefully boxing up 
    the seven paintings for shipment to the Wilson mansion, but one of 
    the crew looks too closely at the Gluttony painting (the pig's eye 
    looks directly at him and winks) and he goes to a water hose, turns 
    it one and shoves it down his throat, where his stomach expands to 
    ridiculous proportions and explodes, his blood splattering all over 
    the Gluttony painting, which it absorbs. We are then introduced to 
    Dylan's older son Louis (Zachary Chyz) who is visiting from college 
    to surprise his father and Gina (who is his stepmother). Louis has 
    brought along girlfriend Kim (Alex Rinehart), whom he plans on asking 
    to marry him (He has the engagement ring in his pants pocket), but he 
    wants to make sure his father and stepmom approve of her and vice 
    versa. It turns out that they all love each other (Dylan is a 
    much-in-demand ecology-minded architect and Gina is an entrepreneur 
    who donates lots of her money to charities, so they are unlike most 
    rich snobs) and they welcome Kim into the family. The paintings then 
    arrive and Dylan and Gina hang the paintings in various rooms (the 
    Lust painting hangs in their bedroom, the Greed painting hangs in 
    Dylan's office, the Envy painting hangs in teenage daughter Donna's 
    [Cynthia Aileen Strahan] bedroom and the Sloth painting hangs in 
    young children Jack [Jonah Gilkerson] and Suzie's [Sheila Krause] 
    playroom. [the Pride and Gluttony paintings also hang on walls in the 
    house, but since we have already seen what they can do, they are 
    basically ignored here]). Donna, who is a plain-jane and has 
    self-esteem issues stares at the Envy painting and immediately wants 
    to change her looks because she wants to land her crush Bobby (Aaron 
    Groben; <B><A HREF="#AttackDonuts2016">ATTACK OF THE KILLER DONUTS</A></B> 
    - 2016), a boy in school who is dating the head cheerleader Tiffany 
    (Tania Fox). Gina looks at the Lust painting and immediately becomes 
    sex-starved, pulling Dylan into the bedroom for some rare afternoon 
    nookie. When Dylan is in his office and stares at the Greed painting, 
    he instantly forgets about his ecology-minded designs and wants to 
    make as much money as he can (while a swarm of toads invade his 
    desk!). The Sloth painting oozes snail slime by the gallon and Jack 
    and Suzie play with it in their playroom. What about the Wrath 
    painting, you may ask? Well Dylan put it in a room where Louis, who 
    is in college to become an artist, puts it on an easel to give Louis 
    some inspiration for his latest creations. Instead of giving him 
    inspiration for the right reasons, it takes Louis over and Dorian 
    Wilde (Danny Tesla) appears and tells him that human blood is the 
    best red paint color and he should use it in his paintings. He also 
    tells Louis that the canvas used for his Sinsation Collection is 
    actually made of human skin (!) and has Louis help rip off the skin 
    off a prostitute's back Dorian has murdered and skinned with a 
    scalpel (He tells Louis that the scalpel was a gift from Jack the 
    Ripper and when he goes to tell Louis the Ripper's actual name, 
    Dorian hesitates and says, &quot;Perhaps that's a story better left 
    to a later date.&quot;). Louis then wants to paint Kim's portrait and 
    tries to tear off her clothes to Kim's objections, who runs out of 
    the house and hitches a ride with Donna to the mall, where Donna buys 
    slutty clothes for the party she is going to tonight where Bobby will 
    be. Kim walks to the art gallery and overhears Gregory arguing with 
    Tess about where the Wilsons live, as he needs to warn them about the 
    paintings. Tess refuses to tell him the address and, as Gregory walks 
    out of the gallery, Kim stops him and he tells her everything he 
    knows about Dorian Wilde and <A HREF="art_of_the_dead_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("148","213") --><IMG SRC="images/art of the dead poster6a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>the
     seven paintings, telling her the only way to stop their power is to 
    burn the paintings to a crisp. Now I could go on and on (which I have 
    already done!), but it's best to discover the rest by yourself. I 
    will tell you this:&nbsp; Nedless to say, the now-slutty Donna 
    attends the party and tries to hit on Bobby, but he refuses her 
    advances. Tiffany tells Donna to leave her party and Donna kills her 
    by bashing her head in with a rock, drags her home, cuts off 
    Tiffany's huge breasts (Donna's are quite small) and lips (&quot;These
     are the lips that kissed Bobby!&quot;) and wears them on herself 
    (It's quite the sight)! Dylan and his young kids become trapped in 
    their respective paintings and Gina tries to fuck everyone she can 
    get her hands on (including unsuccessfully trying to bed stepdaughter 
    Donna!). Louis picks up a hooker, brings her to his new studio and 
    paints her naked body with his own blood (WTF?!?). Kim goes back to 
    the mansion with hopes of setting the Wrath painting on fire and 
    destroying it, as, since it is the most powerful and dominant of the 
    seven paintings, should release everyone from the other paintings 
    (She also finds the engagement ring that Louis tossed to the ground 
    when he saw her go away with Donna). After Donna kills the prostitute 
    with an axe, Louis snaps out of it and collects all six of the 
    paintings left (the Lust goat monster, who has fucked Gina, pulls Kim 
    into the painting) and discovers that if he puts them in the right 
    order they fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. Who will live and who 
    will die when Louis pours paint thinner on the paintings and sets 
    them on fire? That, I'm afraid, you will have to discover for 
    yourself, but the film is not only inventive it's also the quickest 
    96 minutes you can sit through. Sure, it's a little bit campy, but 
    that's on purpose. Check out the end credits for a chuckle or two. 
    Great job Rolfe Kanefsky, you acquitted yourself nicely from the

     The special makeup effects, done by Vincent J. Guastini (<B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm#TakingDebLogan2014">THE
     TAKING OF DEBORAH LOGAN</A></B> - 2014), which includes the goat 
    monster and giant snails, as well as an axe to the head and other 
    bloody carnage are very well done for a low-budget film and the 
    acting is really good by everyone (although Robert Donavan over-acts 
    [perhaps on purpose?] in some of his scenes). What I really enjoyed 
    were the seven paintings, all done by artist Clint Carney, who also 
    acted as the film's Visual Effects Supervisor, which are a mixture of 
    the bizarre and macabre, as well as being painted in bright colors, 
    making all of them pop from the screen (in more ways than one). This 
    film was also edited by Jay Woelfel, better known as the director of 
    one of my favorite films, <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Beyond Dreams Door">BEYOND

     OF THE BODY SNATCHERS</A></B> (1956), only much gorier, with a

    is also one of Hulu's original movies under the <B><A HREF="into_the_dark_hulu_films_2018.htm">INTO
     THE DARK</A></B> banner; monthly films where Blumhouse Television 
    picks a holiday and celebrates it in horrific fashion. The holiday 
    here is St. Patrick's Day, as a group of college students go on a pub 
    crawl, not knowing that they are slowly being replaced by aliens, who 
    look, talk and act like them, only they bleed green instead of red. 
    The film is narrated by Shauna Shore (an excellent Giorgia Whigham), 
    the town drug dealer (!) whose mother (Virginia Louise Smith) is 
    labeled crazy ever since she saw an alien ship crash in the woods on 
    the outskirts of town during the late-'70s and has been warning the 
    town of an impending invasion ever since. The invasion is happening 
    now, as people are being replaced by exact alien duplicates, for 
    reasons not made clear, but I guess we can guess what they want: our 
    planet as their new home. Shauna is a loner, she has no real friends 
    in this town, only people who buy drugs from her, like 
    &quot;Molly&quot;, weed and other low-level prescriptions (but no 
    heroin or cocaine, as<A HREF="crawlers_2020_hulu_original_film.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/crawlers 2020 hulu poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    Shauna is against that!), but she kind of adopts college girl Misty 
    (Pepi Sonuga), who is trying to reconnect with her clique-y friend 
    Chloe (Jude Demorest), who didn't believe Misty when she told her she 
    was raped by fraternity boy Michael (Zachary Roozen). Misty has very 
    few memories of being raped since Michael slipped her a roofie, but 
    she is certain she was raped, but Chloe doesn't believe her. Chloe 
    has taken another girl, Yuejin (Olivia Liang), into her clique to 
    replace Misty, but Misty is determined to win back Chloe's friendship 
    (Why she would want to do this is beyond me, as Chloe only thinks 
    about herself and Misty knows it, but it is that selfishness that 
    will save Chloe's ass towards the end of the film). Chloe is in 
    charge of the pub crawl, but when she is kidnapped by Michael, Misty 
    enlists the help of Shauna, Yuejin and frat boy Aaron (Cameron 
    Fuller) to find her, only to discover that the alien invasion is just 
    beginning, but only Shauna and her mother believe it until it is 
    almost too late. So how do you know who is your friend and who is an 
    alien replica? Why you do like John Carpenter's <B><A HREF="thing_1982.htm">THE
     THING</A></B> (1982); everyone cuts a finger with a knife and if 
    they bleed red, they are human. If they bleed green, they are an 
    alien. Shauna believes the aliens behave with a hive mind, just like 
    ants, so they must find the hive and destroy it (Luckily, Shauna's 
    mother has an alien invasion kit ready, which includes plenty of 
    weapons and C4 connected to a timer!). The hive is located in the 
    building at the final location at the pub crawl, so our 
    &quot;trio&quot; (yes, one of them was proven to be an alien, but I'm 
    not going to tell you who that is!) plant a bomb at the hive and have 
    five minutes to vacate the building, but they try to save as many 
    humans as they can, including Chloe, who now has an exact double. 
    Misty has to decide who is the real Chloe and who is the alien Chloe 
    and she is able to do that by just asking one simple question, which 
    I am not going to reveal to you. Will they escape the explosion in 
    time? Capably directed by Brandon Zuck (his first full-length film), 
    with a teleplay by Catherine Wignall and Mike Gan, this film is full 
    of graphic deaths (including head-stompings and various impalements) 
    and enough foul language to make George Carlin cringe, but in a good 
    way. The film wouldn't work at all if not for Shauna's narration, 
    where most of the film's comedy comes from, as the film proper is 
    nearly comedy-free. There are a few scenes that will have you on pins 
    and needles, especially when Shauna and Misty find Aaron tied to a 
    bed, a huge chunk of flesh bitten out of his leg or when the foursome 
    try to figure out if one of them is an alien. I have been enjoying my 
    subscription to Hulu (I was able to score a &quot;deal&quot; late in 
    2019, where I only pay $1.99 a month for a full year. Yes, it is 
    ad-supported, but the ads don't play during the films, only before 
    and after and they are 30 seconds or less), especially their original 
    films, like <B><A HREF="#LittleMonsters2019">LITTLE MONSTERS</A></B> 
    (2019) and this one. I will be watching more of Blumhouse's series 
    and reporting here how good they are. I can only hope they are as 
    good as this one.;<A NAME="UnclePecker2020"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
    went into <B><A HREF="uncle_peckerhead_2020.htm">UNCLE PECKERHEAD</A></B> 
    (2020) with a lot of apprehension, because, I mean, who wouldn't with 
    a title like that? Five minutes in, I was totally absorbed in the 
    film, as it was hilariously funny, extremely gory and had a cast of 
    unknowns that will win you over with their performances. It also 
    didn't hurt that most of the film was shot in my home state of New 
    Jersey, including Asbury Park (the home of Bruce Springsteen) and 
    Toms River. It's a film about a three-person punk band called simply 
    &quot;Duh&quot;, whose members, female bass player/singer Judy (a 
    terrific Chet Siegel), guitar player/singer Scott (David Bluvband, 
    who is hilarious in his line delivery) and butch female drummer Mel 
    (Ruby McCollister), are about to be evicted from their home, just 
    when they get a six-day, six-city gig to tour. Judy's dream is to 
    open for her favorite all-female punk band at a local venue next 
    week, if only she can get the venue owner to listen to Duh's demo 
    tape. A day before their tour, their van get repossessed, so the 
    three members start putting flyers on parked vans asking the owners 
    if they could borrow it for a week. One van they put the flyer on is 
    not empty, though, as a strange older man with a southern accent 
    (David Littleton) is inside it. After some confusion, he offers <A HREF="uncle_peckerhead_2020.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/uncle peckerhead poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="208" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>to
     drive them on their six-city tour and become their roadie. They can 
    do nothing but accept his offer since no one else has contacted them. 
    On their way to the first gig on the tour, they ask the man what his 
    name is. he tells them his name is &quot;Peckerhead&quot;, but they 
    can call him &quot;Peck&quot;. What they don't immediately know is 
    every night at Midnight, Peck turns into a hideous monster that chows 
    down on people, bloodily ripping them apart and eating them. Judy 
    first discovers this after their first gig, when the bastard bar 
    owner pays the band three dollars for their performance, telling Judy 
    that is all they are worth. As Midnight approaches and Peck is 
    nowhere to be found, Judy goes looking for him and discovers Peck 
    cannibalizing the bar owner. Judy tells the other members what she 
    saw, when Peck appears and tells them of his affliction (it's quite 
    interesting and funny how he became this way, that is if he is 
    telling the truth!), but he asks if the bar owner didn't deserve his 
    fate since he was an arrogant prick. Peck promises never to kill 
    them, because if they give him a shot of medication he has in his 
    glove compartment just before Midnight, he will not turn into the 
    cannibal monster. The members decide to take him at his word and 
    later learn they shouldn't have, because he is not who he says he is. 
    That's all I am going to tell you, because this film should be 
    experienced cold first hand, as I laughed out loud often at the 
    antics onscreen. What I found particularly funny was another band 
    called &quot;Dominion Rising&quot;, whose lead singer, Max (Jeff 
    Riddle), thinks he is superior to Judy and Duh, but Duh always get 
    the upper hand, as their songs are better (they actually are, as 
    everyone here actually sings and plays their own instruments, no 
    shoddy dubbing at all), the songs are actually earworms and it has a 
    finale that changes tone rather quickly and it all works. This is a 
    well written and directed film that knows when to be funny and when 
    not to be. David Littleton is simply amazing and funny as hell as 
    Peckerhead. He will have you laughing until your chest hurts, as his 
    delivery is spot-on, especially when he tells a poolside Judy that it 
    is nearing time for his &quot;insulin shot&quot; while she is trying 
    to hit on a handsome man named Nick (Greg Maness), who loaned the 
    band his home for the night so they didn't have to pay for a hotel 
    room they couldn't afford (Nick turns out to be quite talkative and 
    very loud when he makes love to Judy, embarassing her!). Sophomore 
    feature film director/screenwriter Matthew John Lawrence has made a 
    fantastic film that fires on all cylinders, It's funny, bloody, 
    expertly acted, but it is not scary, because it wasn't meant to be. 
    While there is plenty of bloody gore, most of it is played for the 
    hilarious reactions of the cast, who can't believe what they are 
    looking at. What I especially liked was the clever way this film 
    ended, but if I tell you, it will be ruining the film for you. Let's 
    just say that it is left wide open for a sequel, one I definitely 
    look forward to and I don't say that often! If you want to spend 97 
    minutes deeply involved in a very funny film, there is no better 
    place to look than here, probably my favorite independent horror film 
    of 2020. This has been a year of pandemics and other dastardly 
    events, most of them political, so if you want to forget about it for 
    a little while, search this film out. If you are an Amazon Prime 
    member, it is available streaming for free. I went on Amazon and 
    ordered the Blu-Ray just to support the people involved in making 
    this film, as it has plenty of replay value (I'm sure I missed a lot 
    of comical dialogue by laughing so much!). Don't let this one pass 
    you by!;<A NAME="OneNightBangkok2020"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone

    director Michael Mann's <B><A HREF="collateral_2004.htm">COLLATERAL</A></B> 
    (2004), but I enjoyed this one much, much more, only because Dacascos 
    is a revelation here, in both acting and action, thanks to 
    director/producer/screenwriter Wych Kaosayananda (whom, as 
    &quot;Kaos&quot;, directed the ridiculous, but action-packed <B><A HREF="ballistic_ecks_vs_sever_2002.htm">BALLISTIC:

    actioner <B><A HREF="tekken_2_kazuyas_revenge_2014.htm">TEKKEN 2: 
    KAZUYA'S REVENGE</A></B> [2014]). While the story is nothing 
    original, it's the performances here that counts and there are more 
    than a few surprises to be had as the film advances. Hawaii resident 
    Kai Kahale (Decascos) arrives in a Bangkok airport at 9:00 PM without 
    any luggage, goes into the airport bathroom to pee (a running joke 
    throughout the film has Decascos washing his hands everytime he pees 
    and doesn't find any paper towels to dry his hands. Since this film 
    takes place in one night and Kai urinates four or five times, it 
    proves that he is getting older!) and waits on an outside airport 
    bench for a couple of hours. A motorcyclist pulls up, hands Kai a bag 
    and he jumps on the motorcycle for a short ride. We then see Kai at a 
    restaurant and walk into the bathroom, where he opens the bag, which 
    contains a cell phone and thousands of dollars in cash. Kai reads the 
    information on the cellphone and then hires an Uber-like service, the 
    driver being Fha (Vanida Golten), a female who speaks perfect 
    English. Kai's first stop is the office of a female lawyer, but 
    before he goes inside, he hands Fha $1,000 in cash and says there 
    will be $5,000 more if she will turn off her app and drive him to 
    four more destinations after this one, saying he will answer any 
    questions she has when he comes back from talking to the lawyer. If 
    he comes back and she's not there, he will understand her not waiting 
    for him and she can keep the thousand dollars. We then see Kai enter 
    the lawyer's highrise, take the elevator to the 23rd floor and enter 
    the lawyer's office, where he is greeted by the lawyer's female 
    secretary. She escorts him to the lawyer's office, where he opens his 
    bag, pulls out a silencer-equipped pistol and shoots the female 
    lawyer in the middle of her forehead at a very short distance. We can 
    see by the look on Kai's face that this upsets him very much, proving 
    that he is not a professional hitman (Ignore the synopsis on The DVD 
    sleeve, as none of it is correct, including whom a co-star 
    portrays!). He then exits the lawyer's office, talks to the secretary 
    like nothing is wrong and then exits the high-rise and finds Fha is 
    waiting for him. They converse for a short time and Kai tells her his 
    next stop is the police station, so Fha drives him there. We see Kai 
    exit the car and stealthily walk to an apartment complex, where he 
    knocks on a door and gets into a fight with a cop who lives there. 
    Kai then shoots and kills him with his silencer, finds some files 
    under his bed and reads them (The toolcase holding the files also 
    contains a big plastic baggy of a white powder drug, proving the cop 
    is crooked). Kai doesn't know it, but he sustained a gash on his bald 
    head, but when he walks back to Fha's waiting car, she notices it and 
    he tells her he tripped bumped into a wall. She patches up his gash 
    with her first aid kit and tells him he will need stitches, so she 
    offers to drive him to a hospital, be he says no, she has to take him 
    to his next stop, a nightclub. Meanwhile, a detective, who has 
    recently become a new father (this is important), is investigating 
    the lawyer's and cop's murder and seems to be one step behind Kai, 
    but that won't last for long. Fha, who is beginning to suspect 
    something illegal is going on, reluctantly drives him to the 
    nightclub, where Kai shoots and seriously injures a young man, who is 
    getting a blowjob by a young woman in a private stall. Kai runs out 
    of the nightclub when the body of the still-breathing young man is 
    discovered and everyone starts running out of the nightclub, which 
    Fha witnesses. When Kai gets back in her car and tells her to take 
    him to the hospital, she finally asks him what is actually going on 
    and Kai tells her the truth. He came to Bangkok to kill seven people, 
    who were guilty of the deaths of his daughter, son-in-law and his 
    baby grandchild, who were killed in a drunk driving accident, but no 
    one was ever arrested, because witnesses testified in court that the 
    son-in-law was at fault because he was driving in the wrong lane and 
    hit another car in a head-on accident. Kai knows this is not true 
    since his daughter and son-in-law never rented a car when they were 
    on vacation in Bangkok, so he hired a Japanese &quot;Fixer&quot; to 
    investigate the real story and who were involved in the deaths and 
    courtroom cover-up, giving all that information to Kai in the bag he 
    receieved once he arrived in Bangkok. On their last stop, he 
    purposely didn't kill the young man in the nightclub because he knew 
    he would be transported to the hospital and since the young man is 
    the son of one of Thailand's biggest crime lords (and the drunk 
    driver who killed his family), he knows he will also be there with 
    his wife (played by Mark Dacascos' real-life wife Julie Condra). Fha 
    drives Kai to the hospital, but she leaves once <A HREF="one_night_in_bangkok_2020.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/one night in bangkok 2020 poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Kai
     walks into the hospital, dressed in a white lab coat that he pulls 
    out of his bag, making him look like a doctor. Kai walks into the 
    injured son's hospital room, quickly shoots the mother in the head 
    and then also kills his father and his bodyguard, whom are all taken 
    by surprise. He then confronts the son in his hospital bed, who 
    pleads for his life, but Kai tells him, &quot;If you can drink and 
    drive, you can die&quot; and shoots him with the silencer. What 
    happens next I will leave for you to discover, but I will tell you 
    this: Kai's last stop is the home of the Japanese Fixer (Kane Kosugi; <B><A HREF="ninja_2_shadow_of_a_tear_2013.htm">NINJA

     SHADOW OF A TEAR</A></B> - 2013), who not only gave Kai all the 
    information he needed to kill all the guilty people, he also was 
    responsible for &quot;fixing&quot; the final outcome of his family's 
    deaths for the crime kingpin (He'll do anything if the price is 
    right)! While there is plenty of bloody violence (I love what 
    happened in the hospital after he killed the crime family. It gives 
    the detective a choice and his partner makes the wrong one), it's the 
    conversations that Kai and Fha have with each other that really gives 
    this film some heart and soul. None of it ever seems false; it seems 
    natural, as Kai never lies and knows the truth about everyone, 
    including Fha, in one of the biggest twists in the film that I never 
    saw coming (including the crucifix necklace she has hanging on her 
    rearview mirror). Mark Dacascos is simply spectacular as Kai, who 
    served two terms in the Special Forces in Vietnam, but has kept his 
    nose clean for the past 40 years. His anger turns him into a man with 
    no morals for the guilty, yet he still keeps his heart in a good 
    place, treating Fha with kindness, telling her, &quot;I don't want to 
    kill you&quot; for being an accomplice (in more ways than one!). This 
    film then ends on a note so emotional (throughout the film, Kai falls 
    asleep in the back of Fha's car and goes to his &quot;safe 
    place&quot;: a beach where he fishes, his favorite activity). His 
    conversation with Fha about the different types of fish there are, 
    revealing a lot of Kai's emotionally hurt heart and his feelings for 
    people, is one of the film's shining moments. So, if you like action 
    with a lot of heart and human emotions (I have to admit that I did 
    shed a tear at the finale), please give this film a look. You will 
    probably like it as much as I do. Mark Dacascos is once again on my 
    radar and I couldn't be happier.;<A NAME="BBsWildBoar2020"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B>&#147;Out there we eat them, in here they eat us.&#148;</B> I was

    since this Barney character decided to put his name before the title. 
    While doing research, I was quite stunned to learn that Barney Burman 
    is an Academy Award&reg;-winning special effects technician (for

    certain &quot;something&quot; that kept my mind thinking about the 
    film long after it was over. Any film that does that to me gets 
    automatically put in the Good Category, but that doesn't mean this 
    film is not without its problems. For one, it's horrendously edited, 
    as some scenes just appear without any connective tissue to the scene 
    that came before it, causing confusion for the viewer. Another 
    problem is the ending, which I will not discuss here, except to say 
    it makes no sense at all. But no matter how many faults I find with 
    this film, that certain &quot;something&quot; keeps pulling me back 
    in. One part <B><A HREF="hills_have_eyes_1977.htm">THE HILLS HAVE EYES</A></B>

    Wolf (Daniel Roebuck; <B><A HREF="#PhantasmRavager2016">PHANTASM: RAVAGER</A></B>

    (Michael Reed; <B><A HREF="disco_exorcist_2011.htm">THE DISCO EXORCIST</A></B> 
    - 2011) and his girlfriend Sable (Jessica Sonneborn; <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm#BloodyBibleCamp2011">BLOODY
     BLOODY BIBLE CAMP</A></B> - 2011) embark on the greatest Geocache 
    Challenge of them all: to find the geocache left by entrepreneur 
    Roger Foster (director/producer/screenwriter Barney Burman) in the 
    &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot;, the atom bomb tested region of the Nevada 
    desert, which is said to be worth millions. Using a GPS to track 
    Foster's geocache, they stumble on a grafitti-ravaged derelect 
    building in the middle of the desert. While Turtle is pissing 
    outside, he discovers Foster's GPS homing beacon and brings it to his 
    brother and the others (still dripping with his urine!). Unable to 
    open it, Wolf throws it against the wall, opening up a rabbit hole in 
    the wall that will prove to be the death of most of them. Lamb warns 
    the others about how, whenever this happens in horror films, it 
    usually leads to death and destruction, but Wolf convinces her to go 
    inside the opening with him and the others. This is the gateway to an 
    area of the desert not on any maps and when this group discovers it, 
    all the men are shot and killed by a Boar-Man known simply as 
    &quot;The Hunter&quot; (Douglas Tait; <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm#AlienHunger2013">ALIEN
     HUNGER</A></B> - 2013). Lamb is taken prisoner by The Hunter and put 
    in a small cage in a room that also has Robert Foster as a caged 
    prisoner. She watches as a Boar-Man named &quot;The Butcher&quot; 
    (also played by Daniel Roebuck, but you wouldn't know it because the 
    makeup is so good) hangs the naked body of Turtle upside down and 
    then proceeds to disembowel him and putting his entrails in a bucket, 
    finishing by searing Turtle's flesh with it's own personal brand. 
    Foster keeps telling Lamb not to try to escape, but she doesn't 
    listen to him, freeing herself from her cage, but then getting caught 
    and raped by The Butcher (who has eight large nipples that leak a 
    milk-like substance!), who brands her when he is done. Just when it 
    looks like Lamb is about to be killed, Sable (I was wonderinng what 
    happened to her!) saves the day and knocks out The Butcher. Now ready 
    to escape with the girls, Foster is immediately killed by The Hunter 
    with an axe to his chest as he is about to escape out the door. 
    Earlier, Foster told Lamb that it is fruitless to search for the 
    rabbit hole to escape, but there is a waterway that he heard leads to 
    the outside world, just beyond the tall grass that surrounds the 
    Boarmen's village. After some back-and-forth with the Boar-Men, <A HREF="barney_burmans_wild_boar_2020.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("142","212") --><IMG SRC="images/barney burman's wild boar poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>where
     Sable is shot and eventually dies, Lamb escapes in the waterway, 
    which sucks her under the water, She wakes up and discovers she is 
    back in her world, where three teens are smoking pot in a pickup 
    truck under a bridge. It's not over because The Hunter has followed 
    Lamb into her territory, killing the teens with his high-powered 
    rifle. I'm going to stop the review here, because the finale of the 
    film makes no sense at all. As a matter of fact, the ending stops the 
    film from being a modern-day classic, so it will have to do being a 
    cult film with a lot of problems. What I really liked about this film 
    is that we never find out if these Pigmen were actually human before 
    the radiation turned them into their present condition or if they 
    were wild boars transformed into upright walking beings. Since they 
    only grunt and don't speak English (except for one word: 
    &quot;Go&quot;), I'm leaning toward the latter and not the former. It 
    gets quite bloody at times, especially the butchering of Turtle, but 
    the film really isn't about the gore, it's about a race of 
    &quot;people&quot; who learned to like the taste of human beings, 
    just as we have learned to love bacon (mmmmm...bacon!) and ham and 
    cheese sandwiches. The makeup effects are vastly superior than most 
    other low-budget horror flicks (made for a measely $135,000) and 
    that's thanks to Burman and his crew, who makes sure to give the film 
    a much more expensive look than what the low budget would allow. The 
    Boar-Men's village is a very dirty place, full of rusty, crusty items 
    they picked up from human visitors/victims from before and only once 
    in the film do we see other members of the tribe besides The Hunter 
    and The Butcher, including young Boar-Children. If you want to watch 
    something quite different than anything else out there, give this 
    film a try. Even with its many faults, it's still an engrossing 
    experience you are bound not to forget for a very long time. Isn't 
    that what movies are all about? I'm still trying to decipher the 
    meaning of the opening and closing stop-motion boar puppet sequences, 
    though, but that only means I'm still thinking about the film, right 
    (The opening stop-motion sequence shows the boars being hit by what 
    looks like an atomic blast, which would explain their existence, but 
    the closing sequence still is way over my tiny little human-like head!)?</FONT></FONT></P>

    (2018) became very profitable for the Universal and Warner Bross 
    studios (both films earning the studios well over a billion dollars 
    each worldwide), Warner Bros. gave Wan carte blanche when he wanted to<A HREF="malignant_2021.htm"><IMG SRC="images/malignant 2021 poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    make another horror film. That film was <B><A HREF="malignant_2021.htm">MALIGNANT</A></B> 
    (2021). When Warner test-screened the film in front of an audience, 
    it bombed and shocked Warner Bros., who had no idea how to advertise 
    the film and what they came up with did the film no favors. It bombed 
    in theaters, but I was able to watch it on HBOMax, who had a deal 
    with Warner Bros. for the year 2021 to stream their films the same 
    time they were shown theatrically (thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic). 
    Let me say this: Wan either played the biggest joke on Warner Bros. 
    or delivered a film just oozing the '80s horror film vibe. While not 
    everything works here (there's some awful acting [on purpose?] and 
    dodgy CGI on view), it is still an interesting and entertaining 
    horror flick, something we haven't seen the likes of in over thirty 
    years. I believe that this will become a cult item in the years to 
    come, something I thought I would never say about a James Wan film. 
    With the right advertising campaign, this could have been a winner 
    for Warner Bros. in theaters, but horror films always get short 
    sheeted by studios, unless it's a sequel to a very popular and 
    money-making franchise. Not everyone is going to like this film, but 
    those of us who love 80's horror films, especially slasher films, are 
    bound to get their rocks off on this. Add an unusual (and totally 
    unexpected) tonal shift during the final thirty minutes to the mix 
    and you have a film that defies most modern-day horror movies. The 
    film opens in 1992 at a mental institution. Some patient named 
    Gabriel has escaped and is killing members of the staff. When an 
    orderly tries to shoot the unseen Gabriel with a tranquilizer dart, 
    Gabriel grabs him and breaks his arm (we can see the bone jutting out 
    of the skin). Dr. Florence Weaver (Jacqueline McKenzie) grabs the 
    tranquilizer gun and shoots Gabriel, incapacitating him. The still 
    unseen Gabriel then begins speaking through a radio and Dr. Victor 
    Fields (Christian Clemenson; <B><A HREF="csi_miami_tv.htm">CSI: MIAMI</A></B> 
    [2002 - 2012]) comments that Gabriel has the power to transmit his 
    thoughts through electronic devices. Dr. Weaver has had enough of 
    Gabriel's violent ways and the sequence ends with her saying, 
    &quot;It's time to cut out the cancer.&quot; In the present, Madison 
    Mitchell (Annabelle Wallis; <B><A HREF="annabelle_2014.htm">ANNABELLE</A></B>

    marriage. Her husband Derek (Jake Abel) abuses her and on this day he 
    shoves the back of her head into a wall, making it bleed. She locks 
    the bedroom door, not allowing Derek to come inside. That night, 
    while Derek is sleeping on the couch, he is woken up by strange 
    electrical malfunctions, like the lights going on and off and the 
    radio &amp; TV turning on by itself. Then Derek sees a shadow figure 
    with long black stringy hair, who grabs Derek and kills him by 
    twisting his head nearly off his neck. Madison hears the commotion 
    and comes downstairs (when she sees Derek's dead body, it's quite the 
    sight), only to be attacked by the shadow figure. She wakes up in the 
    hospital with her sister Sydney (Maddie Hasson) by her side. She 
    tells Madison that she lost her baby and when police Detective Kekoa 
    Shaw (George Young) tells Sydney that her sister already had three 
    miscarriages in the past two years, Sydney tells him she had no idea, 
    as Derek would not allow Madison talk to her family (Believe me, all 
    this information is vital to the film). Shorty after leaving the 
    hospital and heading home, Madison tells Sydney that she is not a 
    blood sister of hers; she was adopted by her mother and father when 
    she was eight-years-old and she has no memory of her first eight 
    years (It turns out that Madison tried to kill her adoptive mother 
    when she was pregnant with Sydney). Suddenly, Madison begins having 
    visions of a killer named Gabriel killing Dr. Weaver and Dr. Fields, 
    Madison being unable to move and watching the bloody carnage unfold 
    (This is where the bad CGI comes in, as the walls in her house melt 
    and she is then in the homes of Gabriel's victims). Detective Shaw's 
    partner, Detective Regina Ross (Michole Briana White; <B><A HREF="convict_762_1997.htm">CONVICT
     762</A></B> - 1997) believes Madison is responsible for the murders, 
    because her descriptions of the killing are too spot-on for her not 
    to have committed them. Gabriel then kidnaps a female tour guide of 
    the Seattle Underground (a real tourist attraction that was also used 
    as a location in <B><A HREF="night_strangler_1973.htm">THE NIGHT STRANGLER</A></B> 
    - 1973) named Serena (Jean Louise Kelly) and ties her up in an attic 
    at an unknown location, telling her that she will be the last one 
    that he kills. Long story short, it turns out that Madison had a very 
    troubled past and it has everything to do with the incident at the 
    mental institution during the beginning of the film (Madison's real 
    name is Emily). Sydney and her mother Jeanne (Susanna Thompson; <B><A HREF="slaughter_of_the_innocents_1993.htm">SLAUGHTER
     OF THE INNOCENTS</A></B> - 1993) do some digging and discover that 
    the mental institution is no longer in operation, so Sydney drives 
    there and discovers the files and some VHS tapes about Madison's 
    treatment in the basement of the closed institution (which sits on 
    the edge of as cliff next to <A HREF="malignant_2021.htm"><IMG SRC="images/malignant 2021 poster6a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>the
     ocean, looking like a castle from some Italian Gothic horror film). 
    When Sydney and her mother watch one of the VHS tapes, they make a 
    discovery that will either make you stand up and take notice or 
    you'll throw your hands in the air while saying, &quot;This is 
    ridiculous!&quot; Me? I just went along for the ride and it does pay 
    off in the end. That's all I'm going to say about the plot because 
    it's best if you watch it cold. Filled with flourishes that seem too 
    extravagant for a film like this (such as an overhead, birds-eye 
    view, shot of Madison running through her house), but everything 
    makes sense once you watch the entire film, such as why Gabriel 
    picked now to start his killings. The reveal during the final thirty 
    minutes is certainly one for the books, something I certainly never 
    saw coming (When Detective Ross discovers who Gabriel actually is 
    (?), she says increduously, &quot;&#147;Wait, you&#146;re saying that 
    the killer is...your imaginary friend?&#148; She doesn't know how 
    wrong or right she is!). There's also a cameo by Zoe Bell (<B><A HREF="death_proof_2007.htm">DEATH
     PROOF</A></B> - 2007; <B><A HREF="raze_2013.htm">RAZE</A></B> - 
    2013) as the butch Scorpion (who is wearing a blonde mullet wig!), a 
    prisoner in a crowded jail cell that Madison is thrown in (It turns 
    out the attic Serena was tied-up in was the attic of Madison's house! 
    Serena is able to break free of her binds, but falls through the 
    floor of the attic and lands in the living room, in front of 
    Detectives Shaw and Ross, leading to Madison's arrest. Is Serena 
    related to Madison, err, Emily. in some way?). This is the scene 
    where everything is exposed, showing us who Gabriel actually is, as 
    he gorily slaughters every woman in the jail cell and then goes on to 
    kill nearly every cop in the police station. If you have HBOMax, go 
    there and watch one of the most original horror films of 2021 (It's 
    only available in a 30-day window). Is it ridiculous? Yes, it 
    certainly is, but it maintains your interest throughout and manages 
    to entertain you in ways you thought wasn't possible anymore 
    (Gabriel's weapon of choice and the film beginning with a VHS look, 
    including rollouts, horizontal lines, etc., only add to the 
    enjoyability and hidden humor this film offers). This is the best 
    1980s horror film made in the New Millennium. Need I say more? Thank 
    you, James Wan, for restoring my faith in modern-day horror films. 
    You should keep making more like this, something I thought I would 
    never say!;<A NAME="HalloweenKills2021"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to 
    say that the only reason I subscribed to the Peacock app was to see <B><A HREF="halloween_kills_2020-2021.htm">HALLOWEEN
     KILLS</A></B> (2021) at the same time it appeared in theaters (I'm 
    still not ready to set foot in a movie theater because of Covid, even 
    though I'm probably being nothing but a big baby). I'm very glad that 
    I did. This is a slam-bang horror flick that doesn't skimp on the 
    bloody kills and gives everyone a chance to shine, but if you are 
    expecting Jamie Lee Curtis to face-off against Michael Myers here, 
    you are going to be bitterly disappointed. Even though <A HREF="halloween_1978_celebrating_40+_years_of_michael_myers.htm">all
     the sequels</A> to the original <B><A HREF="halloween_1978.htm">HALLOWEEN</A></B> 
    (1978) have been &quot;de-canonized&quot; (their description, not 
    mine), you'll have loads of fun trying to recognize the sly 
    references to nearly all the sequels<A HREF="halloween_kills_2020-2021.htm"><IMG SRC="images/halloween kills poster6a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    that director David Gordon Green sprinkles throughout the film. The 
    film picks up immediately after <B><A HREF="#Halloween2018">HALLOWEEN</A></B> 
    (2018) ends, after we watch Cameron Elam (Dylan Arnold), the son of 
    original film's Lonnie Elam (played here by Robert Longstreet), finds 
    a still-alive Officer Hawkins (Will Patton, who was stabbed in the 
    neck in the first film), which results in a 14-minute flashback to 
    the events in Haddonfield on Halloween Night, 1978. We see a young 
    Tommy Doyle nearly getting killed by Michael Myers, when a young 
    Officer Hawkins (Thomas Mann) and his partner unknowingly save him 
    and then enter the old Myers home, where his partner is grabbed by 
    Michael Myers. Officer Hawkins draws his weapon and tries to shoot 
    Myers, but he accidentally shoots his partner in the neck, killing 
    him. The police then surround the Myers home when Michael comes 
    walking out of it, all their guns drawn. We are then back in the 
    present, with Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) being transported to 
    Haddonfield General Hospital by ambulance after being stabbed in the 
    stomach by Michael. She is accompanied by her daughter Karen (Judy 
    Greer) and granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) when they hear fire 
    trucks approaching Laurie's burning home. Laurie yells out, &quot;Let 
    it burn!&quot;, knowing that Michael Myers is trapped inside. We then 
    see some graphic operating footage as doctors open up Laurie's 
    stomach and fix her injuries, while the Haddonfield Fire Dept. tries 
    to put out the fire in her home. When one of the firemen falls 
    through the floor into Laurie's basement, where Michael is trapped, 
    Michael graphically kills him with the fireman's own sharp tool, 
    escaping from the basement and killing all the firemen outside (and 
    inside) in very graphic manners (it's a complete bloody massacre). 
    Laurie is then put in a hospital room to recuperate, where she is 
    joined by a recuperating Officer Hawkins. Laurie tells Hawkins that 
    Michael is dead (she doesn't know he escaped from her burning home) 
    and Hawkins tells Laurie that he's glad he is dead, as it was him who 
    allowed him to live back in 1978. Another flashback shows us Dr. 
    Loomis (played by someone to look like Donald Pleasence) is about to 
    shoot Michael Myers in the head back in 1978, but Officer Hawkins 
    stops him from doing it. Up to this day, Hawkins blames himself for 
    all the deaths committed by Michael, if he only let Loomis finish 
    Michael off. After the slaughter of the firefighters, an adult Tommy 
    Doyle (a fantastic Anthony Michael Hall) rallies all the citizens of 
    Haddonfield to hunt down and kill Michael Myers, forming a vigilante 
    group to search for the killer. That's all I'm going to give away, 
    but if you are a fan of John Carpenter's original film, you are going 
    to find a lot to enjoy here. The blood flows freely and the gore goes 
    way beyond what is acceptable in most other horror films with an 
    R-Rating, but the MPA (formerly the MPAA) seems to give these films a 
    pass when it comes to gore and extreme violence. You will see the 
    grown up children of Haddonfield, now adults in their 40's &amp; 
    50's, getting killed by Michael in various gory manners, including a 
    knife in the eye, eyes being poked out with Michael's fingers, a 
    scalp being torn off (poor Nancy Stephens, who returns from the 1978 
    original) and various stabbings using Michael's favorite weapon, the 
    large butcher knife (there's a stabbing in the armpit that's very 
    hard to watch). What's particularly memorable about the film is that 
    everyone in the film is given a chance to shine. Even though Jamie 
    Lee never leaves the hospital in this film (shades of <B><A HREF="halloween_2_1981.htm">HALLOWEEN
     II</A></B> (1981) or even encounters Michael here (that will be the 
    premise of the final film in the trilogy, <B>HALLOWEEN ENDS</B>, 
    scheduled for an October 2022 release), she still registers as 
    Laurie, a no-nonsense broad who doesn't suffer fools gladly. Both 
    Judy Greer and Andi Matichak also give career defining moments, as 
    does Anthony Michael Hall, who promises Laurie &quot;Evil dies 
    tonight&quot;. The sequence towards the end of the film where a group 
    of citizens, led by Tommy, surround Michael Myers and begin shooting 
    and battering <A HREF="halloween_kills_2020-2021.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("140","210") --><IMG SRC="images/halloween kills 2020 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="208" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>him
     across the head and back with baseball bats (&quot;Old 
    Huckleberry&quot; puts in an appearance) and two-by-fours is a thing 
    of brutal beauty, but when they think he is dead, only for him to get 
    up and kill everyone, proves that evil is something that cannot be 
    killed so easily, if at all. The death of Cameron by Michael in front 
    of Allyson is probably the most brutal kill in the film, as Michael 
    knows that Allyson has feelings for Cameron, so he kills him slowly 
    and painfully, Cameron groaning while Michael slowly approaches 
    toward Allyson down the stairs, stopping to grab Cameron's head and 
    twist it 180&#176; in a sickening &quot;snap!&quot;, proving that 
    Michael has no humanity left in his body. The more he kills the 
    stronger he gets. I know some people are going to complain that 
    Laurie never even sees Michael in this film, but they are missing the 
    point. The whole town of Haddonfield is tired of living in fear and 
    wants Michael dead. The film ends with Laurie picking up a bloody 
    butcher knife and saying to Officer Hawkins that it is up to her to 
    kill Michael, even if it means her death. I guess we will have to 
    wait until the final chapter in the trilogy to see what happens, but 
    I think Officer Hawkins will also have a say in the matter. I have to 
    also mention&nbsp; that there are a few actors here that also deserve 
    mentions because of their roles. That would be Michael McDonald as 
    &quot;Little John&quot; and Scott MacArthur as &quot;Big John&quot;, 
    two gay men who are now living in the refurbished Myers home. Their 
    performances raise the film a few notches above most horror films, as 
    does Ross Bacon as escaped mental patient &quot;Tivoli&quot;, who has 
    come to Haddonfield General Hospital to give himself up, only to be 
    chased by a gang of vigilantes, who think he is Michael Myers, 
    through the hospital, which results in him committing suicide by 
    jumping out a hospital window. It should also be noted that Ross 
    Bacon died before the film was released. Also look out for 
    appearances by Charles Cyphers, Kyle Richards and Nick Castle, all 
    returning in their roles from the 1978 original. Originally slated to 
    be released in October 2020, it was delayed by a year due to theaters 
    in the U.S. being shut down by the Covid-19 Pandemic. Since the final 
    credits in the film lists it as a 2021 production, I put it here. I 
    know it's not a DTV film, but I just had to write about it! And you 
    should see it!</FONT></FONT></P>

     DTV Genre Films Part 17<A NAME="Bad2015"></A> (continued): I love 
    most horror films that are released by IFC Midnight. For some reason 
    they are smart and even brutal films with good stories. Not so with <B><A HREF="hallow_2015.htm">THE
     HALLOW</A></B> (2015), which is basically a &quot;monsters in the 
    woods&quot; film with a few effective scenes.&nbsp; A conservationist 
    from London, Adam (Joseph Mawle) travels to Ireland with his wife 
    Clare (Bojana Novakovic) and young baby boy to survey an area in the 
    Ireland forest believed to be hallowed ground (Which brings up a good 
    question: How would a conservationist know it was hallowed 
    land?)&nbsp; Adam searches the land and immediately comes upon a 
    horde of tiny creatures who prey among the lost. Pretty soon Alan's 
    windows are being broken (A window replacement man tells Adam, 
    &quot;If you trespass upon them, they'll trespass upon you&quot;). 
    It's not long before Adam and Clare's house is under full attack from 
    the creatures, who ooze a slimy black liquid that could change people 
    into one of them. Adam believes his baby boy is changing, but Clare 
    doesn't, so there is also some internal strife inside the house. In 
    fact, it is Alan who is changing and not the baby, which makes Clare 
    run out into the forest (Not a good idea Clare!) to try and escape. 
    Alan goes running after her and subsequently finds the creature's 
    home in a hollowed-out tree and it is full of the little buggers, who 
    don't seem scared of Adam. Clare finds a house of a local resident 
    and finds out the creatures are stealing the children of families 
    (which could be why they are so small). The creatures kill Alan and 
    Clare does something so stupid and unfathomable with her baby (yet it 
    works) that she would be arrested for child endangerment in the U.S. 
    But it satisfies both the creatures&nbsp;and at the end we see the 
    creatures' land being destroyed by a logging company during the 
    closing credits. That'll teach these creatures for fooling around 
    with a woman!&nbsp; The last shot we see is a log on a truck covered 
    with the slimy black substance, so the creatures will have to find a 
    new home, hopefully not next to mine! Directed and co-written by 
    first -time feature film director Corin Hardy (whose next film seems 
    to be a remake of <B><A HREF="crow_1994.htm">THE CROW</A></B>, titled <B>THE
     CROW REBORN</B>), who does one right thing that most &quot;monsters 
    in the woods&quot; films dont: He actually gives us a clear view of 
    the monsters. There is very little gore or blood, no nudity and no 
    foul language that I could hear, which makes me wonder why this film 
    got a &quot;NOT RATED&quot; tag (Probably because they never 
    submitted the film to the MPAA) I have seen hundreds of these types 
    of films and this one neither excites or makes you gasp. It just is 
    what it is.; I'm going to keep this review short and sweet because of 
    the bad taste topic, which happens to be suicide. The name of the 
    film is <B><A HREF="forest_2015.htm">THE FOREST</A></B> (2015) and 
    not only is it a bad film full of false scares and tepid dialogue, 
    the theme of suicide just makes my blood boil, especially since this 
    was being made at the time of Robin Williams' suicide and I knew 
    people who committed such an act. Anything for a buck. A woman named 
    Sarah gets a call from the Japanese police saying her twin sister 
    Jess, since she was seen entering the Aokigahara Forest, also known 
    as &quot;The Suicide Forest&quot; and &quot;Sea Of Trees&quot; (since 
    it is a real place, the Japanese would not let the crew film there 
    out of respect to the families of the victims, so they had to settle 
    for the Tara National Forest in Serbia), may have committed suicide. 
    Sarah travels to Japan and hires a guide and a newsman joins her, as 
    they find bodies of suicide victims on their travels and something 
    else may be in the woods following them. Since suicide should not be 
    a topic for a horror film. especially a PG-13 piece of shit like 
    this, I am going to stop here and never watch another film ever 
    directed by Jason Zada (this being his freshman feature directorial 
    debut). A film about a subject so serious should be a<A HREF="body_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/body 2015 poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    documentary or fictional film that traces the causes of suicide, not 
    a $10,000,000 horror film that will make more than its budget in one 
    week and then disappear (It made $26,500,000). The worst part of all 
    of this is that the grotesque posters for the film are actually 
    recreations of some of the real-life suicide victims that were found 
    in The Suicide Forest, some after years of being lost in the forest. 
    Way to pay respect to the families of the victims assholes!; <B><A HREF="body_2015.htm">BODY</A></B> 
    (2015) is a short 75-minute hipster horror drama, only this time the 
    hipsters are three young women. They banter endlessly on Christmas 
    Eve until one of the girls suggests they go to her Uncle's mansion 
    because he always goes away for Christmas. The only thing is the girl 
    is lying. The mansion belongs to a couple she once babysitted for and 
    she knows they always travel on Christmas. What they don't count on 
    is the couple have hired Arthur (screen legend Larry Fessenden) to 
    look after the mansion and when two of the girls spot him at the top 
    of the stairs, one of them pushes him down the stairs and think they 
    have killed him. His back is broken, but he is still alive and he 
    begs the girls to call for an ambulance. The leader of the girls 
    doesn't want to get in trouble for breaking and entering, even though 
    Arthur promises he won't say a thing, so they leave Arthur in another 
    room and hope that he dies during the night. When he doesn't, the 
    leader goes into the room and suffocates Arthur. They are now all 
    responsible for murder, so the other two girls come up with a plan 
    that will kill their leader and make it look like Arthur did it. And 
    they get away with it. That is the entire film in a nutshell, so you 
    don't have to watch this slowly-moving short feature film. Again, it 
    takes two directors, Dan Berk &amp; Robert Olsen (who both also wrote 
    the screenplay), this being their first barely feature-length film, 
    to come up with a film that has plenty of cursing, but no nudity and 
    barely any blood or gore. Even as a straight thriller, this film 
    doesn't pass muster (Why doesn't a huge mansion have a camera 
    security system?) and I would advise anyone wanting to see this film 
    to change their minds. The acting and technical aspects of the film 
    are fine. It is just the movie that stinks.; The crime film <B><A HREF="momentum_2015.htm">MOMENTUM</A></B> 
    (2015) starts out exciting enough, as four thieves in high-tech body 
    suits that hide their identities and distort their voices steal a 
    load of money and some diamonds from the bank's even more high-tech 
    safe. The person that hired them to pull off the heist, a U.S. 
    Senator (Morgan Freemen, in a five-minute cameo) doesn't want the 
    money or diamonds, but a USB drive with top secret blueprints on it 
    that is in the diamond's pouch that will bring governments to their 
    knees. One of the thieves, Alexis Farraday (Olga Kurylenko; <B><A HREF="hitman_2007.htm">HITMAN</A></B> 
    - 2007), who is a martial arts ass-kicker, finds the USB drive, while 
    the Senator has his men (led by Mr. Washington, played by James 
    Purefoy, the best asset of this film) kill the thieves and try to 
    kill Alexis, but she manages to get herself out of all types of 
    situations, including gunfights, hand-to-hand combat and car chases. 
    While all the fights and chases are terrific, we are cheated out of a 
    proper ending, when the Senator is told that Alexis is going to be a 
    martyr by releasing the contents of the USB drive on the internet and 
    the Senator says, &quot;Do you know what makes a martyr? You have to 
    be dead.&quot;, as we watch Alexis fly away in a plane. THE END. Huh? 
    Then I learned that this film was supposed to be the first part of a 
    franchise, yet when this movie (filmed mainly in South Africa) was 
    released in the United Kingdom, it just earned a paltry $69.00 on ten 
    screens on its opening weekend, so I can guarantee you that there 
    will be no second film in this series. We never learn what is on the 
    USB drive (except for a quick look at the end of the film) or who 
    Alexis really works for. Olga Kurylenko is great on the eyes and can 
    fight really well (as well as kill without emotion using a gun), but 
    an action film needs a plot that audiences can understand and leaving 
    everyone hanging at the end is a major no-no. Freeman's short film 
    time was shot in two days in Los Angeles as a favor for&nbsp; 
    director Stephen S. Campanelli because he was the Camera &amp;

    (by impalement). The only person to escape is Raul Baccaro (Steven 
    Michael Quezada; <B><A HREF="breaking_bad_tv_series_2008.htm">BREAKING
     BAD</A></B> [2008-2013]) when the police arrive. Will is arrested 
    and charged with involuntary manslaughter and the judge imposes a two 
    year suspended sentence, with five years probation after the two 
    years are up. Will drives to his father Frank's (Eric Roberts, in a 
    much bigger role than usual in these kind of films and the best thing 
    about this film) house and tells him he is giving up the bounty 
    hunting business he inherited from his father, who has retired. Frank 
    is none too happy that Will has given up a business that he gave him 
    and makes it known in no uncertain terms. Almost as soon as he comes 
    home, he is greeted by one of his old bounty hunting team, who tries 
    to kill Will in a bar. Turns out that Raul has turned all the bounty 
    hunting team against each other (using relatives' lives as a way of 
    making them do it) without Will's participation and he runs a very 
    lucrative high-stakes internet business, where helicopter drones (the 
    kind with four spinning blades on each four corner) equipped with 
    cameras keep an eye on the action, while the rich elite place bets in 
    an abandoned warehouse on who lives and who dies during each battle. 
    While there are plenty of gunfights, hand-to-hand combat (which is 
    particularly weak since Orton is a good wrestler) and big explosions, 
    the film fails for one big reason: We have seen this all done before 
    and done much better.&nbsp; There is plenty of blood (the female 
    cop's death is memorable) and bloody bullet squibs and a fiery 
    explosion-filled finale, where Will takes on Raul, who decided to put 
    himself in the game because two of Will's ex-team join with Will (as 
    does Frank) and refuse to kill each other, although the sniper on his 
    team tries his hardest to kill them all in his dune buggy at the most 
    inopportune times. Basically this film is <B><A HREF="hard_target_1993.htm">HARD
     TARGET</A></B> (1993; which Roel Rein&eacute; directed a <A HREF="hard_target_2_2016.htm">sequel</A> 
    of in 2016, starring new action icon Scott Adkins!) without enough 
    talent to make it believable (and Randy Orton has some big ears!). 
    Only Eric Roberts registers here as a disappointed father who slowly 
    realizes that son Will is being set up. Otherwise, this is ordinary 
    at best. Director Roel Rein&eacute; used the pseudonyn &quot;John 
    Rebel&quot; to direct two non-sequels, <B><A HREF="bear_2010.htm">BEAR</A></B> 
    and <B><A HREF="wolf_town_2010.htm">WOLF TOWN</A></B> (both 2010) 
    which get shown a lot on the Chiller channel. They are also pretty 
    bad horror flicks.; OK, now will someone tell me who wanted 
    practically a word for word remake (or as they rather call it, a 
    &quot;reboot&quot;) of director Eli Roth's 2002 horror flick<A HREF="cabin_fever_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/cabin fever 2015 poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> <B><A HREF="cabin_fever_2002.htm">CABIN
     FEVER</A></B>? Well it seems like director Travis Zariwny (who uses 
    the name &quot;Travis Z&quot; here) and screenwriter Randy Pearlstein 
    (who used most of Eli Roth's script verbatim) filmed their own 
    version of <B><A HREF="cabin_fever_2015.htm">CABIN FEVER</A></B> in 
    2015, with Eli Roth's blessing (he is one of this film's Executive 
    Producers and puts in an uncredited cameo) and made this idiotic 
    piece of deja vu, only with worse actors and some comedy that falls 
    flatter than a ten year-old girl's chest. The only real difference 
    between the two films is the opening of the new one, where a guy 
    camping out in the woods returns with a dead rabbit and tells his dog 
    that they now have dinner. He turns the dog over and it sprays him in 
    the face with blood. The dog's name? PanCakes (a take off on a 
    certain scene in the original). The rest of the film is basically an 
    exact retread of the original, only with two differences: 1.) Instead 
    of the partying cop Detective Winston (Giuseppe Andrews), this films 
    does a gender reversal and Detective Winston is now a female partying 
    cop, played by Louise Linton (and she gets much less time than 
    Giuseppe) and 2.) instead of the group having a single-shot rifle, 
    they now have a fully automatic rifle (Now where does an older 
    teenager gets his hands on a full auto?). This film also ups the gore 
    factor than the 2002 film, but the original was much better acted and 
    we never knew what was going to happen (and it was gory enough), only 
    here, 13 years later, we know EXACTLY what is going to happen. No 
    surprises, nothing new. Oh, and it completely omits the old man in 
    the backwoods store and his iconic line to the three black people who 
    walk into his store at the finale (We have to be politically correct 
    now and it pisses me off!). Instead, they substitute a scene that 
    leaves this film wide open for a sequel that I hope never happens. It 
    makes me wonder why this film was greenlit so soon after the 
    original. It is Rated R, so anyone born in 2002 would still not be 
    legally able to see it without a parent or guardian, Sometimes it 
    boggles the mind that people would remake a film that already had <A HREF="cabin_fever_2_spring_fever_2009.htm">two</A> <A HREF="cabin_fever_patient_zero_2014.htm">sequels</A> 
    and do it so soon (one sequel was made a year before this film!). 
    Doesn't anyone have an original idea in their heads? If you feel you 
    must see this film, remember one thing: It went the basic limited 
    theater/VOD route in 2016 before being dumped on Home Video and Cable 
    TV. If you haven't seen the original film, I would recommend that you 
    watch that one instead because it was a quasi-hit back in 2002 and 
    for a reason. It was somewhat original in its ideas and was acted so 
    much better than this one. This new reboot is for masochists only. 
    Especially if you have seen the original. This reminds me so much as 
    when director Gus Van Sant tried to remake Alfred Hitchcock's <B><A HREF="psycho_1960.htm">PSYCHO</A></B> 
    (1960) word-for-word, scene-for-scene in <A HREF="psycho_1999.htm">1998</A>.
     Just like this film, it stank, it bombed and all because the 
    directors and actors didn't have the talent to pull it off.; <B><A HREF="andron_2015.htm">ANDRON</A></B> 
    (2015) is exactly like those &quot;Young Adult&quot; films like <B><A HREF="maze_runner_2014.htm">THE
     MAZE RUNNER</A></B> (2014; actually based on an Italian TV movie 
    called <B>THE PLACE</B> [2012], made by the same director of this 
    abomination), but with more blood and foul language to give it an 
    R-Rating. In the far-off future, a group of people wake up in an 
    underground maze and must figure a way to get out. The problem is, 
    this is a game developed by Chancellor Gordon (Danny Glover) and 
    controlled by Gamemaster Adam (Alec Baldwin; both Baldwin and Glover 
    shot their scenes in one day) called &quot;The <A HREF="andron_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/andron 2015 poster10 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Redemption
     Game&quot; and the entire population are slaves. The slaves also bet 
    on which person will come out of the maze alive and if their pick is 
    killed, so are they. This entire game is nothing but a ploy to kill 
    as much as the population as the ruling government can, because in 
    the words of Chancellor Gordon, &quot;This planet can not sustain 
    more than 2 billion people&quot;. Cameras follow the group, as they 
    are attacked by cyborg-like soldiers and traitors within the group 
    and the group is whittled down little by little. They also manage to 
    defeat the Gamemaster from time to time, which pisses off Chancellor 
    Gordon, who promises Adam that he will be killed if anything else 
    goes wrong with the game (But Adam has more tricks up his sleeve than 
    a cheesy Vegas magician). In the finale, after all the fighting (much 
    of it shot in the dark, so it is impossible to make out), two people 
    make it out alive and they are welcomed by a voice that tells them, 
    &quot;Welcome to Level Two.&quot;, as the computerized outside 
    buildings morph into an ocean and our two heroes are standing on a 
    beach. Huh? C'mon now, throughout the entire film, there was no 
    mention of different levels of the game. This 
    Italy/Malta/UK/Canada-financed film, directed and written by 
    Francesco Cinquemani (his first theatrical feature and it shows), was 
    hoping for a sequel, which is made quite apparent by the ending, but 
    I can't see it happening unless the investors want to lose money. 
    This movie was filmed in 21 days and it is apparent as the mole on a 
    witch's nose. The fighting is horribly staged, the futuristic special 
    effects consist of Adam's computer and some quick shots during the 
    end (all done poorly) and both Baldwin and Glover (who is quickly 
    becoming the king of B-film cameos) look bored beyond belief. It had 
    a quick limited theatrical/VOD release in the Summer of 2016 in the 
    U.S. and then quickly went to pay cable. This is a cheap, grimy YA 
    wannabe that is not worth the time of YA enthusiasts. Even the 
    R-Rating makes no sense, because all we ever see are people being 
    electrocuted by futuristic weapons and puddles of blood, things we 
    have already seen in PG-13 films. It got the rougher rating because 
    people say fuck more times than a PG-13 film will allow. Please save 
    me from watching crap like this!;<B> <A HREF="thirst_2015.htm">THIRST</A></B> 
    (2015): Did you hear the one about a badly-rendered CGI metal 
    exo-skeletoned alien that crash-lands on Earth (in its meteor-like 
    spaceship) right in the path of a desert boot camp for troubled 
    teenagers, who accidentally kill the alien's baby? You have? Good, 
    then I won't have to explain any further with what you can expect 
    here, including all adults being killed, the troubled teenagers 
    turning on each other, the bad metal alien hunting them down 
    one-by-one and the frequent royalty payments that should have been 
    made to James Cameron. Director Greg Kiefer's only other feature film

     <B><A HREF="boy_2015.htm">THE BOY</A></B> (2015) is another one of 
    those horror films that was made for a minimal amount of money ($8 
    million) in hopes that the first week in theaters would make four 
    times the budget. Well, the film went on to make $11 million on the 
    first week in theaters (hardly a blockbuster) and made nearly $36 
    million by the time it left theaters 2 months later (it also made $23 
    million in all foreign territories). A nice haul for a film so absurd 
    it wouldn't scare anyone (thanks to its PG-13 Rating). American Greta

     movie</A>.) found out Greta was pregnant with his baby and he beat 
    her up, killing the fetus in the process. When she gets to the 
    mansion, she meets handsome food delivery man Malcolm (Rupert Evans; <B><A HREF="asylum_blackout_2011.htm">ASYLUM
     BLACKOUT</A></B> - 2011), who tells her she is in for a very strange 
    experience (and you know almost from the beginning that Greta and 
    Malcolm will become lovers). Greta meets Mr. &amp; Mrs. Heelshire 
    (Jim Norton [not the comedian; <B><A HREF="straw_dogs_1971.htm">STRAW DOGS</A></B> 
    - 1971] &amp; Diana Hardcastle), who introduce her to Brahms: A 
    creepy porcelain doll that the mother and father treat as if he is 
    alive. Even though Greta finds all this extremely strange, she 
    accepts the job (Mrs. Heelshire tells her that Brahms accepts her, 
    the first caretaker he has approved of in over two years) because she 
    is getting a pile of money to basically do nothing. The Heelshires 
    tell Greta that they are going on a much needed vacation (they 
    actually put rocks in their coat pockets and walk into the ocean, 
    killing themselves.), but there is a list of rules Greta must follow 
    to make Brahms happy. When the Heelshires are gone, Greta takes it 
    easy, ignoring the rules and she soon finds out by not following the 
    list of rules, that she is being punished. Her shoes, clothing and 
    necklace disappear and other strange things happen (Most of them jump 
    scares while Greta is sleeping, a turn-off for any real horror fan). 
    Greta decides to follow the list of rules and her items begin to come 
    back to her. Malcolm tells her that Brahms died in a fire at the 
    mansion twenty years ago, so the Heelshires made a doll to replace 
    him. About three quarters into the film, Cole tracks Greta down and 
    the film does a complete 180&#176; turn. A turn so unbelievable, that 
    you will immediately begin to feel ripped off. While Cole is abusing 
    Greta and Malcolm appears to try and stop him, it seems that the real 
    Brahms is still alive, wearing a porcelain mask to cover his 
    fire-scarred skin (which we never get a good look at) and spying on 
    everything and everyone that goes on in the house through secret 
    hallways behind the walls. Brahms wants Greta for himself, so he 
    kills Cole with a piece of the doll's head that Cole smashed on the 
    edge of a coffee table by stabbing him in the neck (we never really 
    see anything), knocks-out Malcolm (Why doesn't he just kill him?) and 
    chases after Greta. Greta manages to stab Brahms in the leg and 
    stomach with a screwdriver, rescues Malcolm and they both drive off 
    to safety. The final shot finds Brahms, who is somehow still alive, 
    gluing the pieces of the doll's head together. Next victim, please!

    (2015), a thriller about two young women, Emily (Anna Hutchison) and 
    Leslie (Dr&eacute;a Whitburn), who manage to piss-off a faceless 
    driver of a big tow truck in their cherry red Ford Mustang and are 
    chased for what seems like forever. When they do get out of the car, 
    Emily manages to pick on the wrong truck driver in a diner and then 
    later, manages to knock herself out by falling and hitting her head 
    on a rock and when she wakes up, Leslie is missing. She searches for 
    Leslie, but not in the obvious places. This film hits on all the 
    clich&eacute;s: From lack of cell phone service, nearly getting run 
    over by the Wrecker while making a phone call to the police in a 
    glass phone booth (Do those still exist?), an emergency phone on the 
    side of the road not working to being pulled over by an unbelieving 
    police officer (an unbilled Michael Biehn; good choice Michael!), who 
    gets hit by the Wrecker and disappears (now you see him, now you 
    don't). Emily finally gets the Wrecker to teeter over a cliff and she 
    finally checks her trunk where she finds the body of Leslie (We see 
    nothing except Emily scream and close the trunk!). Emily backs up her 
    Mustang into the back of the tow truck and it falls off the cliff (no 
    explosion, no nothing!). The finale is really perplexing, as another 
    young woman stops by the Wrecker's gas station and the camera pans 
    across the yard, where we see Emily's Mustang, a few other cars and 
    vehicles and finally the Wrecker. The headlights go on and the film 
    ends, Director/co-writer Micheal Bafaro (The director of the 
    interesting serial killer film <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Barber">THE

     PACK</A></B> (1977), you have nowhere to go but down. This was

    are in for. In Clouse's film, pet dogs turn feral and form packs when 
    tourists visit a small vacation island and leave the dogs there to 
    fend for themselves when they leave. In Red's film, a small town 
    experiences a meteor shower and a mysterious green meteor hits near 
    town, forcing all dogs (no other animals, just dogs) to turn into 
    vicious, teeth-showing and drooling killing machines (a seeing-eye 
    dog drags his blind master into the middle of the road, where he is 
    hit by a car.). Town citizens, including Dave (Rob Morrow, a long way 
    from TV's <B><A HREF="numb3rs_tv_series_2005-2010.htm">NUMB3RS</A></B>

     3</A></B> - 2000) and a bunch of other residents try to outrun all 
    the murderous dogs that use to be their pets (there is one small dog 
    that seems to be unaffected), only to be picked-off one by one by the 
    bloodthirsty dogs (a mixture of physical effects, real dogs and awful 
    CGI). Their only choice is to make it to a plane at the small airport 
    on the outskirts of town and only four people make it (Thank God; the 
    plane couldn't fit more than four people and a tiny dog!) and take 
    off just in the nick of time. They fly to another town hundreds of 
    miles away and, as they get off the plane, discover that they are 
    surrounded by drooling dogs ready to use them as chew toys. It looks 
    like the entire world now has a severe vicious dog problem. THE END. 
    All I can say is Eric Red (who has said he tried to shoot this film 
    with the same color gel lighting as Dario Argento's <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Suspiria1977">SUSPIRIA</A></B> 
    - 1977!) must have needed the work because this film contains none of 
    his regular suspenseful scenes (even the other <B>THE PACK</B> copy, 
    2006's <B><A HREF="breed_2006.htm">THE BREED</A></B>, was much more 
    entertaining than this; there was even an Australian version of 
    Clouse's film made in 2015, appropriately called <B><A HREF="pack_2015.htm">THE
     PACK</A></B>!) and since this was made for TV (Rated TV-14), there 
    is some blood and minimal gore, but not enough to make you take 
    notice as much as you will notice The Asylum's crappy CGI. If you 
    want to remake a film that offers thrills and bloody situations 
    galore, do not make it for TV. A film like this needs to be made for 
    theaters or DTV. Of course, The Asylum released this on DVD as being 
    &quot;Unrated&quot; because DVDs do not usually use TV ratings 
    (unless they are TV Series Season box sets). If you watch this film, 
    you will find it hard to believe that Eric Red wrote the screenplays

     AT THE DOOR</A></B> (2015) is a bad retelling of the Manson murders 
    in 1969. During The Summer of Love a sleeping husband and wife are 
    interrupted from their sleep in the middle of the night when Mary (a 
    cameo by Jane Kaczmarek; <B><A HREF="malcolm_in_the_middle_tv_series_2000-2006.htm">MALCOLM
     IN THE MIDDLE</A></B> [2000-2006]) is awoken by someone knocking on 
    their front door and husband John (Chris Mulkey - <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Tomcats1976">TOMCATS</A></B> 
    [1976]) goes downstairs to see who is knocking, but there is no one 
    at the door. John tells Mary that no one was there when someone 
    knocks on the front door again. Mary calls the police while John goes 
    downstairs to investigate. He runs upstairs and locks the bedroom 
    door while we see someone is trying to break it down. When the police 
    arrive they see &quot;LITTLE PIG&quot; painted in red on the front 
    door&nbsp; and &quot;LITTLE PIG&quot; painted on the wall leading 
    upstairs. When they get to the bedroom, the police see painted on the 
    bedroom door &quot;LET ME IN&quot;, but John &amp; Mary are fine. It 
    looks like Manson's followers were just going out on a dry run. We 
    then turn our attention to a pregnant Sharon (Katie Cassidy; and it 
    doesn't take a genius to know who she is supposed to be.) and three 
    friends celebrating the departure of one of them to Boston. Suddenly 
    Two men and two women invade the house in the middle of the night and 
    we then squint to see people being murdered because it is so dark The 
    victims turn out to be two of Sharon's best friends, Abigail 
    (Elizabeth Henstridge, TV's <B><A HREF="agents_of_shield_tv_series_2013.htm">AGENTS

    From what I could make out from this short, 73-minute film is that 
    some of the murders are bloody, especially when Sharon gets stabbed 
    in the stomach with a knife (we see the blade slowly being pulled out 
    of her stomach) and the film ends with David Brinkley (remember him?) 
    reporting on the real-life murders, along with a short interview with 
    the real Manson (actually, the scariest part of the film!). The film 
    really offers <A HREF="12_rounds_3_lockdown_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/12 rounds 3 lockdown poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="146" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>nothing

     ROUNDS 2: RELOADED</A></B> (with Randy Orton). The wrestling star 
    here is Dean Ambrose (real name: Jonathan Good) as police officer 
    John Shaw who is just back from injuries suffered in a gunfight that 
    got his partner killed (all the other officers in this precinct blame 
    him for his partner's death). He comes across some evidence in the 
    form of a credit card with a memory card attached to it that points 
    to Officer Tyler Burke (Roger R. Cross) and 11 more police officers 
    are dirty and just killed another officer the night before (We see it 
    happen in the beginning of the film). Burke knows Shaw has the 
    incriminating evidence, so he sets off a fire alarm and puts the 
    entire precinct in lockdown (It is the largest police precinct I ever 
    saw!). Shaw carries a 12 round .45 pistol and plans to use one bullet 
    on every crooked cop, while Burke convinces the higher-ups that Shaw 
    is the one who is dirty. Ambrose acts crazy in the WWE wrestling ring 
    , but plays it fairly subdued here, Sure, there is some wrestling 
    moves in the film, but it looks like half the film's budget went 
    towards blanks and bullet squibs. For a WWE film, this film is fairly 
    bloody (People get shot in the eye and have a knife shoved under 
    another crooked officer's chin), but we have seen this film a hundred 
    times before and director Stephen Reynolds (<B><A HREF="vendetta_2013.htm">VENDETTA</A></B> 
    - 2013) keeps things moving at a quick pace but it offers nothing new 
    for action fans. Even the double surprise ending, where a good cop 
    turns out to be crooked and Shaw redeems himself by using a sneaky 
    measure (Fuck cell phones that can record voices!) and uses his last 
    bullet on Burke's knee didn't surprise me. In these films, the good 
    guy always wins. And the viewer always loses. Some people may like 
    this just to see a calm Dean Ambrose instead of his over-the-top 
    performances in the ring (his nickname is &quot;The Lunatic 
    Fringe&quot; on WWE), but this is your standard WWE DTV sequel flick.

     DTV Genre Films Part 18 (continued): <B><A HREF="child_eater_2015.htm">CHILD
     EATER</A></B><A NAME="ChildEater2015"></A> (2015) is one of those 
    DTV films with no back story, but wants you to believe that 
    everything that is happening is real. We first see a young girl with 
    a bloody hand&nbsp; and carrying a doll while walking through the 
    woods, she walks and walks and walks until she gets to a river, where 
    she tosses the bloody doll into the water. She continues walking, 
    walking, walking until she gets to a park. As she is walking across 
    the street, a female driver stops her car and runs to the little 
    girl, who says, &quot;He hurt me.&quot; She turns around and we can 
    see that her right eye is missing. The camera pans down to her bloody 
    hand and when she opens it, she is holding her eye. Twenty five years 
    pass and we concentrate on Helen Connolly (Cait Bliss), a troubled 
    young woman who has just broken up with her boyfriend Tom (Dave 
    Klasko), so she asks her Sheriff father (James Wilcox) to get her 
    jobs to keep her busy. He gets her a job as a babysitter to young 
    Lucas Parker (Colin Critchley), a new boy in town who is sure some 
    old man is following him. Lucas has a crush on Helen, so he is not 
    happy when Tom pays Helen a surprise visit at his house. Helen tells 
    Tom that she is pregnant, so the callous Tom asks her, &quot;Is it 
    mine? Are you gonna keep it?&quot; Lucas disappears (Tom thinks it 
    because he has a crush on her), but it<A HREF="child_eater_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/child eater poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    is more serious than they both think. Lucas has been kidnapped by the 
    monstrous Robert Bowery (Jason Martin), a local legend in this neck 
    of the woods. It seems Bowery suffered from macular degeneration and 
    was slowly going blind, so he kidnapped children, put masks over 
    their heads so they were as blind as he was and then ate their eyes 
    (!), believing that eating eyes of children would reverse his 
    condition (Why? It is never explained). Helen's best friend, Deputy 
    Casey (Brandon Smalls) gets a phone call at the station by a person 
    who says her name is Ginger. She sings a nursery rhyme and then says, 
    &quot;He's awake now.&quot; This seems to trouble Sheriff Connolly, 
    as this has awoken something deep inside him and he begins to worry 
    for the safety of his daughter (Earlier in the film, a bird flies 
    into Lucas' house and he says to Helen, &quot;If a sparrow flies 
    through your house, it means someone is going to die.&quot;). Helen 
    and Tom go looking for Lucas in the woods (filmed in Catskill, NY, an 
    old stomping ground of mine). They end up at an old deserted camp 
    ground, which is considered &quot;off limits&quot; by the residents 
    and they find evidence that someone was staying there. What do they 
    do? Why, they split up, just like in hundreds of other horror films! 
    Tom steps on a bear trap and screams bloody murder. Helen arrives 
    just in time to see Bowery rip out Tom's eyes with his monstrous 
    hands (a decent effect). Helen runs away and ends up in a deserted 
    farm house, full of missing person posters and newspaper stories 
    about missing children taped to the walls. Ginger (Melinda Chilton) 
    then appears and Helen passes out. When she wakes up, she is tied to 
    a tree and we learn that Ginger is the young girl we saw holding her 
    own eye in the beginning of the film. She is holding a shotgun on 
    Helen and tells her, &quot;Call for him. This ends tonight!&quot; We 
    then see Lucas waking up, finding himself with a mask over his head 
    in a house full of dead bodies.&nbsp; Helen then breaks free and 
    knocks out Ginger. She calls the police and then accidentally (?) 
    stabs herself with a knife and passes out, She wakes up in a hospital 
    room, brought there by her father, who wants to know what happened. A 
    nurse comes in and tells Helen that she and her baby are going to be 
    okay. It seems that Bowery is on the loose once again, but how can 
    that be since he has been long dead? If you are looking for answers, 
    you won't find them in this trifle of a film, which is heavy on gory 
    eye removal (even Helen gets one of her orbs removed), but light on 
    explanations. This (Kickstarter-funded) film, based on a 2012 short 
    of the same name, makes very little sense and seems way too long for 
    its short 82-minute running time. Icelandic director/screenwriter 
    Erlingur Ottar Thoroddsen doesn't bother to explain why Bowery 
    returns or if it is even Bowery at all. He just appears and doesn't 
    look human at all, with a large mouth full of sharp teeth and sharp 
    talons for hands. Of course, bullets can't stop him, which makes me 
    wonder how he was caught 25 years earlier. Like most modern-day DTV 
    horror films, Helen's best friend Casey is gay and he ends up saving 
    her life when Bowery rips out one of her eyes and he shoots him in 
    the head (What?), leading to Helen grabbing a gun and shooting every 
    bullet into his head, too (Double What???), as we watch Bowery's body 
    transform into a pile of goo that is absorbed into the ground. It 
    also ends like most modern-day DTV horror flicks, as we watch a 
    pregnant Helen walking down a dark hospital corridor, when Bowery 
    appears behind her, saying, &quot;They're best when they're 
    fresh!&quot; setting up the film for an unwanted sequel. Stay tuned 
    after the end credits for a worthless stinger. Nothing about this 
    film stands out, not even the creepy Catskill location shoot, of 
    which I am very familiar. Available free streaming on Amazon Prime. 
    Why bother?;<A NAME="Containment2015"></A> <B><A HREF="containment_2015.htm">CONTAINMENT</A></B> 
    (2015) is one of those films that makes you think, even if it's for 
    the wrong reasons. What would you do if you woke up in your apartment 
    and found your doors and windows sealed shut (with some type of 
    epoxy), as well as your electricity, gas and water turned off? <A HREF="containment_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/containment 2015 poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="165" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>That's
     what happens to the residents of the Oslo Towers apartment buildings 
    in Southhampton, U.K. The buildings are then surrounded by people 
    dressed in orange hazmat suits, who set up camp on the apartment 
    buildings' grounds, with snipers on the roofs to kill anyone who 
    tries to escape. The residents on one floor break open the walls of 
    their apartments and join together to try and find a way to escape, 
    but they are the most cliched people ever to staff a film. There's 
    the level-headed Mark (Lee Ross), mute young boy Nicu (Gabriel 
    Senior), violent Sergei (Andrew Leung), who believes a punch in the 
    face resolves everything, young impressionable woman Sally (Louise 
    Brealey), insufferable Aiden (William Postlethwaite), who has a 
    snotty remark for every situation, and elderly lady Enid (Sheila 
    Reid), who thinks booze and cigarettes are a food group (she's the 
    best thing about the film). They discover that some type of new virus 
    is killing the residents of the buildings and the government have 
    trapped everyone inside to die. After watching the government killing 
    innocent residents, a group of residents join together and kill 
    everyone they think is involved in this, whether they are or not, 
    even going as far as to attack and kill some of our main players 
    simply because they captured Hazel (Pippa Nixon), one of the 
    hazmat-wearing government officials. The major problem with this film 
    is not only the cliched characters, but what they don't do in this 
    situation. Not once does someone even try to break a window, even 
    though one of them is armed with a hammer. And this brings up other 
    problems that have no proper explanation, such as how the government 
    sealed everyone's windows, even up ten floors, without waking anyone 
    up (I guess they gassed them)? How did they even do it all in one 
    night??? The film is outright sloppy in spots, as director Neil 
    Mcenery-West (his first directorial effort) piles on the 
    inconsistencies without any explanation, until the viewer throws 
    their hands up and cry &quot;Uncle!&quot; There's no graphic violence 
    or bloodshed to speak of, as the camera pulls back when it should 
    move forward and there a WTF?!? ending that has no legitimate 
    explanation (What's a mute boy going to do with a cell phone?). All 
    in all, this is a movie you can skip without hesitation. It offers 
    nothing new or interesting. Nice idea, bad execution.; <B><A HREF="quiet_hour_2015.htm">THE
     QUIET HOUR</A></B><A NAME="QuietHour2015"></A> (2015) is a British 
    post-apocalypse film about a worldwide alien invasion that has 
    crippled Earth. The aliens, who live in giant &quot;hives&quot; that 
    float in the sky, have killed most of the human population, as they 
    mine the Earth for its minerals. Only this film doesn't give us a 
    single view of the aliens (!), only showing us brief glimpses of 
    their ships. The film is about a girl named Sarah Connelly (Dakota<A HREF="quiet_hour_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/quiet hour 2015 poster3a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="164" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    Blue Richards) and her blind brother Tom (Jack McMullen), who was 
    blinded when the aliens first came to our planet in a bright flash of 
    light (killing their mother), as they try to survive the two hours a 
    day the aliens quit mining and return to their hives. Sarah has 
    recently buried their father, who committed suicide due to the 
    hopelessness he feels, but she refuses to tell Tom, letting him think 
    that their father will return shortly. Enter Jude (Karl Davies), a shotgun-toting
     stranger who breaks into their farmhouse looking for food, only 
    Sarah knocks him out with the butt of her rifle. Tom wants Sarah to 
    kill Jude, thinking that he is not worth saving (&quot;It's what 
    father would do!&quot;), but Sarah sees something in him that Tom 
    doesn't see (basically someone to have sex with!). There is also a 
    cannibalistic family (food is in short supply on Earth, so people 
    have taken up eating human flesh) who wants to kill Jude for killing 
    a member of their family. Jude tells Sarah and Tom that he killed the 
    man when he watched him murder his wife and young daughter, but is he 
    telling the truth? This is a boring, slow-moving film, where nothing 
    much happens until the final ten minutes, where Sarah and Jude fight 
    off the cannibal family and Tom rebels when he discovers his father 
    is dead.&nbsp; Filled with unrealistic scenes, such as the cannibal 
    mother, Kathryn (Brigitte Millar), sacrificing herself to the aliens 
    when her entire family is wiped out, this film, directed and written 
    by St&eacute;phanie Joalland (her only feature film at the time of 
    this review) seems twice as long than it really is, thanks to the 
    lack of blood, gore and nudity (Sarah is nearly raped by the cannibal 
    father and she makes love to Jude, but there is no naked skin to be 
    seen), making this film an extreme loser. I guess we are supposed to 
    admire that even though this is an alien invasion film, we never see 
    the aliens, but for God's sake, give us something to enjoy! Skip it.;<A NAME="Chatter2015"></A>&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="chatter_2015.htm">CHATTER</A></B> (2015) is a film that 
    lives up to its name. It's all talk and no action. The film starts 
    out interestingly enough, where Nate Terry (a bloated Richard Hatch; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Unseen Evil">UNSEEN
     EVIL</A></B> [1999/2001]) walks into the Department of Homeland 
    Security to show old friend, Chief Director Greer (James James; no, 
    that's not a typing error!) a video chat he had with his daughter. It 
    shows his daughter being taken by a demon spirit that traveled 
    through the internet from a haunted house Hatch was investigating to 
    his daughter's apartment and she disappears on camera. Nate wants 
    Greer to keep an eye out for his daughter, knowing the Department of 
    Homeland security &quot;monitors&quot; (i.e. illegally spies on) 
    video chats all over the world. Greer says he will keep an eye out 
    and Nate walks out of his office, but not before saying, &quot;Once 
    they know you can see them, they will come after you.&quot; That is 
    the last time in the film we will see Nate or any mention of his 
    daughter's disappearance. Instead, the film concentrates on 
    Department of Homeland Security worker Martin Takagi (Tohoru 
    Masamune) one of the &quot;monitors&quot; of video chats. He stumbles 
    on a chat going on between husband David Cole (Brady Smith; <B><A HREF="truth_or_dare_2018.htm">TRUTH
     OR DARE</A></B> - 2018) , a film music composer in Los Angeles, and 
    wife Laura (Sarena Khan), a lawyer in London. David has purchased a 
    new place to live and Laura has given her two weeks notice at her job 
    and plans on joining her husband in L.A.. Martin gets interested in 
    this <A HREF="chatter_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/chatter 2015 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>married
     couple for personal reasons, as Laura promises David some long 
    distance video sex that night, so Martin works overtime to see Laura 
    naked. Unfortunately, Laura keeps her bra and panties on during the 
    sex play, but something strange is going on in the apartment David 
    now lives in. Laura, who had a miscarriage a short time ago, keeps 
    seeing a ghostly little girl behind David during the video chats, but 
    every time David turns around, she's not there. Things get dangerous 
    when David finds a trap door in a closet, which leads him to a secret 
    basement, where a toy doll sits in one of the corners. David also 
    cannot get any sleep, as he keeps hearing a child cry during the 
    night. It gets so bad, that David asks his lawyer friend, Ted (Pete 
    Capella) to talk to his realtor, Alex (Laura Niles), to see if this 
    place has some kind of history. All Ted can come up with is the name 
    &quot;Hausland&quot;, as Alex refuses to talk to him, but the name 
    doesn't ring a bell to David. Then it starts getting very strange. 
    Everyone David talks to start getting into weird accidents. Ted takes 
    a stumble down the stairs in his house, but in actuality, something 
    supernatural throws him down the stairs. David's brother-in-law (and 
    Laura's brother) Charles (Derrick Redford) gets into a car accident 
    and David's mother has a heart attack. A next door neighbor informs 
    David that a little girl named Anna died in his place in 2007 at the 
    age of seven. It all starts coming together when Ted, who is still 
    alive, but a paraplegic, informs David that &quot;Hausland&quot; is 
    actually the maternal last name of Alex and Anna was her daughter. 
    David realizes that he had an affair with Alex back in 2000 and, 
    doing the math, comes to the conclusion that Anna may be his 
    daughter. Anna, meanwhile, travels through the internet to Laura's 
    apartment in London and Laura adopts the ghostly girl as her own! The 
    biggest problem with this film, directed by Matthew Solomon (his only 
    feature at the time of this review), is that the film is staffed with 
    unlikable characters. David cheated on his wife, not only with Alex, 
    but also with starlet Meghan Collins (Ashley Palmer), as well as 
    Laura's best friend, Jenna (Clementine Heath), while Laura had an 
    affair with her boss Bob (P.J. Marshall), so it's hard to root for 
    either of them. Martin is nothing but a perverted peeping tom, who 
    watches David and Laura's conversations, not for National Security, 
    but for his own thrills. He also leaves the room just when the 
    supernatural stuff begins to happen, seeing none of it. The film ends 
    on an abrupt note, where not one thing is resolved, making this film 
    nothing but a giant cheat on the audience (there is also a stinger 
    after the final credits where Martin seemingly gets his comeuppance). 
    I hate found footage films because, just like this film, it promises 
    something scary, but fails to deliver. There's no nudity, no one 
    actually dies on screen (they just get hurt badly!) and the violence 
    always happens in the dark. I can't believe people actually love this 
    genre of film. They promise you the moon, but all they give you is a 
    rock. Skip this film and watch some internet porn.;<A NAME="BeyondTheGates2015"></A> 
    A lot of people have been telling me that I must see <B><A HREF="beyond_the_gates_2015.htm">BEYOND
     THE GATES</A></B> (2015), but after viewing it, I have to wonder 
    what the big deal is. Sure, it brings back memories of visiting my 
    local video store in the '80s, walking among the shelves of VHS tapes 
    that seemed to go on forever, but it has little to offer most viewers 
    besides the nostalgia factor. In 1992, Bob Hardesty (Henry LeBlanc) 
    and his wife Marilyn (Caryn Richman; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Sleepstalker">SLEEPSTALKER</A></B> 
    - 1995) open their own video store (it's actually the front to Eddie 
    Brandt's Saturday Matinee video store in North Hollywood, 
    California), while their young sons, Gordon and John watch in 
    amusement. Cut to the present, where we see fully grown brothers 
    Gordon (Graham Skipper; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#AlmostHuman2013">ALMOST
     HUMAN</A></B> - 2013) and John (Chase Williamson; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#VictorCrowley2017">VICTOR
     CROWLEY</A></B> - 2017) packing up the store after the mysterious 
    disappearance of their father, who we learn was never the same since 
    Marilyn was in a car accident. Bob turned into a man who was mad at 
    everyone and sometimes brutally violent, especially when Marilyn left 
    him. While packing up the store, Gordon and John find a VCR game 
    titled &quot;Beyond The Gates&quot; in their father's office and 
    bring it to their father's house where they are both staying, along 
    with Gordon's girlfriend Margot (Brea Grant; <B><A HREF="halloween_2_2009.htm">HALLOWEEN
     II</A></B> - 2009). We learn that John is a regular fuck-up who 
    hangs around with the wrong people, such as his friend Hank (Justin 
    Welborn; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DanceOfTheDead">DANCE OF THE DEAD</A></B> 
    - 2008), a verbally abusive asshole who says what he pleases without 
    any guilt at all. We also learn that Gordon is an ex-alcoholic who 
    gave up booze after grabbing the wrist of Margot while drunk during 
    an arguement and breaking it. When Margot sees the VCR game, she 
    suggests that they all play it, not knowing that this is no regular 
    VCR game (as someone who played such games in the '90s, I can<A HREF="beyond_the_gates_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/beyond the gates poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    tell you all of them sucked): You don't play it, it plays you, and if 
    you don't follow the rules of the, game it will mean your death. As 
    soon as they put the tape into the VCR, they are greeted by the 
    Gamekeeper, Evelyn (Barbara Crampton;<B> <A HREF="reanimator_1985b.htm">RE-ANIMATOR</A></B> 
    - 1985; still looking hot as hell), who tells them they must find 
    four keys to save their father's soul. Evelyn talks to them like she 
    can actually see them (she can) and finding the keys will mean the 
    deaths of their friends, which neither Gordon and John are aware of 
    until it is too late. The first key is found buried in a metal box in 
    their backyard. The key is inside a cloth doll, but when John cuts it 
    open with a knife to retrieve the key, we see Hank in a bar, his 
    stomach being slit open by an invisible force in the same way as the 
    cloth doll. When John pulls out the key, we see Hank's intestines 
    rising in the air as if being held by some supernatural force, 
    resulting in Hank's gory death (I will give the film credit, it's a 
    death that is quite impressive). The second key is found in the head 
    of a clay figurine, but when Gordon pulls the key out, it causes the 
    head of his cop friend, Derek (Matt Mercer), to explode (another 
    impressive gore effect). When the gate appears in their basement 
    Gordon, John and Margot will have to make some hard decisions, but 
    will they still be alive when the film ends? Will their father's soul 
    be saved? So what's my problem(s) with this film? For one, it takes 
    forever to get to playing the game. The first forty minutes is spent 
    on getting to know Gordon, John and Margot and to make matters worse, 
    they are not interesting in the least (they are all vanilla and very 
    boring). I found myself freezing the film whenever they were in the 
    store, just to look at the titles on the VHS boxes and the posters 
    hanging on the walls. To me, that's the best aspect of this film, as 
    the rest of the story is not that interesting, including the game, 
    which doesn't seem to have any palpable rules at all, as if director/producer/co-screenwriter
     (with Stephen Scarlata; also a Producer) Jackson Stewart was making 
    it up as they went along (The actual printed rules they show are 
    actually instructions for using a Milton Bradley Ouija Board!). Add 
    to that a totally pat finale that makes absolutely no sense at all, 
    just so all the characters survive for a happy ending, and you have a 
    film that's totally ordinary in every way, except for a couple of 
    very gory deaths, but we all know that good gore doesn't make a good 
    film. More patient viewers may find themselves enjoying this film 
    much more than I did, but when I read that this was one of the best 
    horror films released in 2016, I expect a lot, something this film 
    failed to deliver. Too much filler and not enough meat.;<A NAME="AfterDeath2015"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Everyone wants to know what happens to us after we die, but the film <B><A HREF="afterdeath_2015.htm">AFTERDEATH</A></B> 
    (2015) tells it in such a heavy-handed way, it will make you want to 
    live forever. Basically a five character play, this film opens with 
    Robyn (Miranda Raison) waking up on a beach, not knowing how she got 
    there. Suddenly the beach begins exploding and smoke demons arise out 
    of the explosions, forcing Robyn to flee the beach. When she looks 
    back, she sees &quot;Even The Good Are Damned&quot; written <A HREF="afterdeath_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/afterdeath 2015 amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>in
     huge letters in the sand. After checking her pulse (she has none), 
    all Robyn can see in the distance is a beach house and a lighthouse, 
    so she goes to the beach house, where the lights are on. There is a 
    sign on the front of the house that reads &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;, 
    which is Latin for &quot;Clean Slate&quot;, so she enters the house 
    where she sees three people, Seb (Sam Keeley), Patricia (Elarica 
    Johnson Gallacher) and Livvy (Lorna Nickson Brown) engaging in 
    three-way sex. Robyn introduces herself, where the trio say they are 
    not alone, Onie (Daniella Kertesz) is in the bathroom. When Robyn 
    goes to check on her , she sees Onie cutting her wrist over and over 
    with a knife, but she doesn't bleed. Onie also has the habit of 
    disappearing into thin air in the blink of an eye, later returning to 
    the exact same spot where she disappeared (Livvy likes playing 
    practical jokes on Onie, by placing a bowl of water where she 
    disappeared, so when she returns, Onie gets her feet wet!). It turns 
    out everyone appeared the same way Robyn did, only Seb, Patricia and 
    Livvy appeared on the beach together, Seb saying the last thing he 
    remembers was being at a rave where something deadly happened. Seb 
    then says, &quot;We're all dead&quot;, but is he right? The 
    lighthouse's bright beam then hits the house, causing everyone to 
    fall to their knees in pain, as we see images of a baby in the womb 
    and hear the cries of a baby. What does this all mean? Are they in 
    Hell, as Seb believes? Slowly, everyone begins to realize that rooms 
    in this house are familiar to them. Seb says the living room looks 
    exactly like the room that he had in college, right down to the 
    furniture. Everyone else has a room in the house that is familiar to 
    them. Robyn says, &quot;This house was made for us specifically. What 
    did we do to deserve this? If we're being punished, then somebody 
    thinks we did something.&quot; They begin to play a game of Truth or 
    Dare with endless bottles of Vodka that magically appear in a wooden 
    cooler in the kitchen, a cooler no one recognizes. The more they 
    drink (but they don't seem to be getting drunk), the more everyone 
    confesses to minor sins they committed, but not the major ones that 
    may have put them here (Seb says, &quot;Once I didn't wear a condom. 
    I crushed a Morning After pill and put it in her morning 
    coffee.&quot;). Robyn then tells Seb that she was interviewed as a 
    witness to a rape he was accused of. Seb says he didn't rape anyone, 
    it was consensual and he wasn't charged. Robyn asks Seb if he 
    remembers the girl's name and he says no, asking Robyn if she knows 
    her name. Before she can answer, they are hit with the bright 
    lighthouse beam again, once again sending everyone to their knees in 
    pain (as well as seeing the baby in the womb and hearing its cries). 
    Seb wants to have a word with Robyn outside, where he says he played 
    her little game and it's time to fucking move on. Robyn tells Seb 
    that they are connected and it may have something to do with everyone 
    being here. Seb wants to know the real reason Robyn is here, but she 
    says nothing, even though it is obvious she is hiding something. 
    After Patricia and Seb have a fight, where Patricia breaks Seb's 
    hand, he takes a walk to the beach, where he sees &quot;Damned&quot; 
    written in the sand. He is then hit with the lighthouse beam and 
    chased by smoke demons, one of which throws him to the ground and 
    rapes him in the ass! Robyn looks at a wall mirror and tells everyone 
    this is not what she looks like in real life. The other three women 
    admit the same thing, Robyn saying she looks better, idealized. Onie 
    once again disappears and when she returns, she comes back with a 
    bracelet she didn't have before. Before Robyn can look at it, a smoke 
    demon appears and rips it out of Onie's hand. Robyn believes Onie is 
    their only hope of leaving this place, theorizing that she is 
    traveling between two planes of existence and when she disappears, 
    she goes to a place that is real and physical. (Like she is in a 
    hospital and is in serious condition, between life and death. When 
    she disappears, she regains consciousness and when she reappears, she 
    is back in an unstable state of death, not quite dead and not quite 
    alive). Seb returns to the house and says he was raped by a demon. 
    When Livvy laughs, he attacks her, forcing Patricia to stab him in 
    the head with a kitchen knife, killing him. Everyone drags Seb's body 
    into another room so they don't have to look at him. Robyn comes up 
    with an idea to trap a smoke demon in the wooden cooler (It's a 
    rather long-winded explanation) and when she is successful, Robyn 
    makes it tell them the reason they are here by spashing it with 
    vodka! The demon says, &quot;That's the way the system works&quot;, 
    following it with, &quot;Eternity insurance.&quot; Suddenly, Seb 
    comes out of the room (&quot;You can't kill me twice!&quot;),<A HREF="afterdeath_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/afterdeath 2015 poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    knocks Robyn to the floor and starts torturing the demom by spraying 
    it with vodka, until the demon escapes and possesses Seb. A possessed 
    Seb grabs Patricia by the neck and then breaks her back, saying to 
    Robyn, &quot;It knows what we all did. There is no escape!&quot; Seb 
    is then sucked through the front door and disappears into the ether. 
    So what ties all these people together, you may ask? Seb, Patricia, 
    Livvy and Onie were all at a concert in a club called J.J.'s when a 
    fire broke out and nearly everyone was killed due to the club being 
    overcrowded and above legal capacity. The owner of J.J.'s? Robyn, of 
    course. The final words in the film are Robyn's, as she says, &quot;If
     you see God, tell him to go fuck himself. Hell is other 
    people.&quot;, as the beach house implodes when the bubble 
    surrounding it gets too small to hold the house. This would have been 
    a much better episode of <B><A HREF="twilight_zone_streaming_tv_series_2019.htm">THE
     TWILIGHT ZONE</A></B> (the new version on CBS All Access) than a 
    feature film, as the pace is much too languid to hold the viewer's 
    attention. I had no problem with the acting, all except for Elarica 
    Johnson Gallacher as Patricia, who overplays her role as a complete 
    bitch. It took two directors, Gez Medinger &amp; Robin Schmidt (the 
    first feature film for both), to make this convoluted mess, even 
    though the screenplay, by Andrew Ellard (his first feature film 
    script), has a lot to say about life and death. It's a valiant try, 
    as the CGI effects are good (I did like the women walking toward the 
    lighthouse, yet no matter how far they walk, the lighthouse is the 
    same distance away and they only end up a few hundred feet away from 
    the beachhouse, as if they were all walking in place), as well as a 
    certain painting hanging in the beach house that tells the story 
    better as the film progresses than the film does itself. It's not a 
    complete loser, but it is bad enough for it to be put in the Bad 
    Category. More religious types may disagree, but like Robyn says, 
    &quot;Tell God to go fuck himself.&quot; The only good thing I can 
    say about this film is that it doesn't try to force religion down 
    your throat. It plays more like a horror film with religious 
    undertones (In this place, morning never comes, it is eternally 
    dark). Available streaming on Amazon Prime (at the time of this review).;<A NAME="DeathsDoor2015"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="deaths_door_2015.htm">DEATH'S DOOR</A></B> (2015) is an 
    abysmal haunted house horror film that contains awful acting, 
    aggravating characters and pacing that can be best described as 
    totally erratic, like an ADD-riddled teenager was given the job of 
    Editor. Twelve seemingly unrelated strangers are invited to a party 
    (by text) at a foreboding mansion, but once they are inside, they are 
    unable to leave, as all the doors and windows are locked (Not once 
    does anyone try to break a window!). They soon start dying in 
    mysterious ways (One woman is tied to a chair and devoured by rats. 
    Another woman has her legs cut off. A man voluntarily puts his head 
    in a guillotine, only to have his noggin' lopped off!) and the 
    mansion holds clues as to why they are there. It seems, sometime in 
    the 1920's, a magician named Mesmer The Magnificent (Obba 
    Babatund&eacute;; <B><A HREF="eye_2008.htm">THE EYE</A></B> - 2008) 
    was performing <A HREF="deaths_door_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/death's door 2015 dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>his
     &quot;Flaming Coffin&quot; trick, where he is handcuffed and chained 
    in a wooden coffin while the coffin is soaked in gasoline and set on 
    fire. Mesmer is unaware that his wife is cheating on him with his 
    assistant and they have rigged the coffin so that he can't escape. As 
    he is burning to death in front of a live audience, he pleads for 
    help and when his hulking friend Jomo (Tommy 'Tiny' Lister; <B><A HREF="#BooneBounty2016">BOONE:
     THE BOUNTY HUNTER</A></B> - 2016) tries to save him, his face is 
    horribly burned. In the present, the ghost of Jomo haunts the 
    mansion, killing members of the party indiscriminately, usually by 
    grabbing them by the throat with one hand and lifting them into the 
    air (which I have no doubt Mr. Lister can actually do!). But why? 
    Okay, in case you haven't guessed, the members of the party are 
    actually decendants of the assistant and the cheating wife and the 
    ghost Mesmer and Jomo have, for some unknown stupid reason, decided 
    that they must pay for his death. Idiotic, right? I do not know why 
    innocent descendants must pay for something they had no control over. 
    The fact is, most of these party members are so cliched, you'll look 
    forward to them dying. The main offender is Bruce (Chico Benymon; <B><A HREF="nite_tales_the_movie_2008.htm">NITE
     TALES: THE MOVIE</A></B> - 2008), a black man who sets race 
    relations in this country back 100 years.&nbsp; His character is so 
    annoying, you'll want to strangle him with your bare hands for the 
    things he says and does. When he finally dies, I believe I heard loud 
    applause coming from somewhere in the distance. But the main fact of 
    the matter is none of the party members act like normal people. All 
    the women do is scream loudly (a lot!), while the men argue with each 
    other about who is right or wrong. I really wanted to turn this film 
    off after the first fifteen minutes, but my conscience won't allow me 
    to do it because I'm thinking about you, my dear readers and how you 
    would suffer watching this piece of excrement. This is 
    director/screenwriter Kennedy Goldsby's (<B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm#IfITellYou2014">IF

    to laugh at the really skinny actor with hair so big, a good gust of 
    wind could make him airborne! Okay readers, you have been warned!;<A NAME="Encounter2015"></A> <B><A HREF="encounter_2015.htm">THE
     ENCOUNTER</A></B> (2015) is another bad found footage film that 
    contains all the elements I hate about the genre, mainly, that sickly 
    green night vision mode that affects nearly all of the last half of 
    the film; stupid people doing stupid things, like running away from 
    aliens when their lives are threatened while still holding a running 
    camera and showing us nothing; and headache-inducing shaky-cam 
    footage that infects nearly every found footage film. This is the 
    plot: When an alien spacecraft crashes in the woods of Arizona, three 
    separate groups of people (well, two groups and a single female park 
    ranger) get caught up in the mess. First to investigate the crash is 
    park ranger Alice (Eliza Kiss, the best actor in this film, but her 
    screen time is short) who goes to the crash site, sees the crashed 
    spaceshift and touches&nbsp; a slimy alien pod object, which bites 
    and infects her with some alien disease. She is unable to contact the 
    outside because, for some reason (which we will learn later on), her 
    radio and cell phone won't work in the area, so she goes home and 
    films her slow infection from this alien disease, hoping someone 
    finds the footage and learns from it. Her infection is rapid and she 
    transforms into an alien/human hybrid (the best part of the film), so 
    we never see her again (at least<A HREF="encounter_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/encounter 2015 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    not in human form). The second group of people are two hunters out 
    for a weekend of deer hunting in the same part of the forest where 
    the alien ship crashed. The younger member of the hunting duo, Trevor 
    (Owen Conway), has attached a Go Pro camera to his hat and another 
    one to his chest so he doesn't miss any of the hunting action (and 
    also to give this film an excuse to show the footage he filmed), 
    while tho older hunter, Duncan (Dan Higgins), gets fatally wounded by 
    an alien hybrid.&nbsp; Trevor treks through the woods looking for 
    help, but all he runs up against is a green light that emits from the 
    sky and places him on another alien spacecraft (footage we never 
    see!). When they release Trevor back into the woods, he seemingly 
    knows everything that has happened because the aliens told him (but 
    none of it is explained to us!). He finds the wounded alien from the 
    crashed spaceship (a typical CGI &quot;Gray&quot;) and loses his life 
    when he tries to help it. The last group of people are failed 
    documentary filmmaker-turned-teacher Collin (Clint James), his 
    girlfriend Kimberly (Megan Drust) and friends Ryan (Louie Iaccarino) 
    and Holly (Paulina Vallin), who go to the same neck of the woods for 
    a weekend of camping, pot smoking and sex (but absolutely no female 
    nudity is shown). They are attacked by one of the hybrids, who kill 
    Ryan and go after the other three (who all seem to have cameras in 
    their hands). Extremely long story short, the military show up in the 
    woods and find the only survivor, a naked Collin, lying in the woods 
    and they take him back to a lab. In a bitter disappointing finale, we 
    leard that Collin was apparently taken aboard an alien ship, where he 
    was told this entire incident was all an unfortunate accident and the 
    aliens never wanted this infection to spread, so they killed everyone 
    who was infected, destroyed the crashed ship and left. That is the 
    only explaination we get, as the film just ends. 
    Director/screenwriter Robert Conway (<B><A HREF="exit_to_hell_2013.htm">EXIT
     TO HELL</A></B> - 2013) offers nothing new here, just the standard 
    found footage tropes and very little in the way of entertainment. 
    Devoid of graphic violence or nudity, this is a pretty boring 80

    have to. Watch <B><A HREF="#Encounter2018">ENCOUNTER</A></B> (2018)

    If you must watch this film, don't view it on the YouTube channel

    life that he probably never had before: Love. He follows her around, 
    sends her flowers, eats where she works as a waitress and it is plain 
    to see that Holly thinks Seth is a creep. One day at work, the German 
    Shepherd is about to be put to sleep, which upsets Seth because it 
    was his favorite pet in the shelter. The veterinarian asks Seth if he 
    wants to take the dog home before he gives him the hypodermic needle 
    that will kill him, but Seth says his apartment doesn't allow 
    animals, so the dog is killed. This gives Seth an idea to capture 
    Holly and keep her as his own pet. He uses a paralyzing agent on her 
    and puts her in a box and brings her to the pet shelter in the middle 
    of the night (He is almost caught by the guard Nate [Da'Vone

    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> [1968] on TV when he hears Holly moan) and 
    brings her down to the bowels of the shelter, where there are tunnels 
    and a cage, which Seth puts her in. Most of the film is Seth telling 
    Holly that she has to throw away her inhibitions and accept her fate 
    as his lover, but when Nate discovers Holly in the cage, the film 
    takes a 180&#176; turn, which I will not explain here (In the film's 
    only funny moment, Seth is stabbing the huge Nate in the stomach with 
    a pen knife and Nate says, &quot;Are you stabbing me?&quot;). Let's 
    just say that Holly, even though she is still locked in the cage, now 
    controls Seth's life. The film becomes the same as the first half, 
    only the roles are reversed (Holly says to Seth, &quot;Maybe you're 
    not supposed to save me. Maybe I'm supposed to save you.&quot;). 
    Director Carles Torrens (<B><A HREF="apartment_143_2011.htm">APARTMENT

    slow-going, a hodge-podge of cheap psychological wording (it turns

    return to a twisted kind of &quot;normalcy&quot;) and the police

    (2016) is just another one of those supernatural horror films where a 
    family moves into a haunted house, strange stuff happens, they all 
    die and another new family moves in at the finale. That's basically 
    the whole storyline to this hackneyed film. The film opens up in the 
    1800's, where a couple go to a strange looking house to meet a 
    medium, Madame Addison (Maria Olsen; <B><A HREF="lords_of_salem_2012.htm">THE
     LORDS OF SALEM</A></B> - 2012), to find out if their daughter, who 
    has been missing for three weeks, is dead or alive. The medium asks 
    the couple to give her something that is important to them and the 
    husband (who is a non-believer) gives her his pocket watch. During 
    the seance, where Madame Addison tells the couple not to break the 
    circle (Guess what happens?), the medium becomes possessed by an evil 
    spirit, slit's the wife's throat with a knife (probably the most 
    bloody scene<A HREF="remains_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/remains 2016 poster6 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    in the film) and then kills the father. Cut to present times, where 
    recent widower John (Todd Lowe; &quot;Terry Bellefleur&quot; on <B><A HREF="true_blood_cable_series.htm">TRUE
     BLOOD</A></B> from 2008 to 2014), teenage daughter Izzy (Brooke 
    Butler; <B><A HREF="sand_aka_blood_sand_2015.htm">THE SAND</A></B> - 
    2015), and young son and daughter Aiden (Dash Williams) and Victoria 
    (Hannah Nordberg) are driving to look for a new house to live in, 
    when they run across the same house where the couple were murdered 
    100 years before and it is so cheap, John can hardly believe it, so 
    he buys it from real estate agent Claire (Ashley Crow), who knows the 
    history of the house, but dances around John's questions. It is not 
    long before the usual haunted house crap happens: Doors close by 
    themselves; the library has all the books strewn over the floor; 
    people see ghosts for a split second; an old Victrola keeps playing 
    buy itself; and John gets a warning from a ghost girl named Melissa 
    (Lisa Brenner), who suddenly appears in the attic and tells him to 
    burn everything because &quot;She&quot; is coming. Aiden and Victoria 
    find a chest full of stuff and show it to their father. It has the 
    pocket watch in it, a creepy doll that Victoria wants to keep, Tarot 
    cards, and &quot;ghost photos&quot;, which were usually fake photos 
    double exposed to make it look like ghosts were present. John asks 
    Claire about why all this stuff is in the attic and she tells him 
    about Madame Addison and the murders of the couple. John does some 
    research (Seems that there have been more murders in this house over 
    the years) and becomes highly concerned, because Aiden and Victoria 
    are changing their attitudes, talking in monotone and disobeying him 
    and he believes Claire is not telling him everything about the house. 
    He throws away everything that was found in the chest into the 
    garbage outside, but he discovers that all of it is back in the house 
    (He catches next door neighbor Melissa [Lisa Brenner] reading Aiden 
    and Victoria's future with the Tarot cards when he comes home and 
    John throws her out of the house. She comes back that night to 
    apologize and tells him that ever since her father entered that 
    house, he had a near-fatal heart attack and now she looks after him 
    next door). John tries a do-it-yourself home exorcism kit, but it 
    fails and John once again finds the pocket watch on the floor. It all 
    ends with the entire family either dead or joining &quot;She&quot; in 
    the depth of the Underworld and ends with another couple with kids 
    moving into the house, meeting Claire at the front door. I can 
    honestly say there is not one genuine scare in this film. This is 
    director/screenwriter Thomas Della Bella's first stab at a horror 
    film (he is usually a Production Assistant on TV Series and 
    Theatrical Films) and he has to learn if you are making a haunted 
    house film, put some scares in the damn thing. I can't complain about 
    the acting and technical aspects of the film because they are all first-rate,
     but as a horror film, it stinks. Don't waste your time unless you 
    have to see every haunted house film ever made (and this is no <A HREF="legend_of_hell_house_1973.htm"><B>THE
     LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE</B></A> [1973] by a long shot).; <B><A HREF="caretaker_2016.htm">THE
     CARETAKER</A></B> (2016) starts out creepy enough, when a male 
    caretaker digs up a box outside and gives it to sick old lady Birdie 
    (Sondra Kerr Blake; <B><A HREF="helter_skelter_1976.htm">HELTER SKELTER</A></B> 
    - 1976), the owner of the creepy house, who is listening to 78 rpm 
    records on her Victrola while sitting in her favorite chair. Inside 
    the box is a ragdoll named Scarlett and a pair of scissors. Birdy 
    takes the pair of scissors and cuts her right hand deeply, causing 
    blood to drip to the floor. The caretaker hears her cries and enters 
    her bedroom, where he finds her standing and she says to him, 
    &quot;Get out of my house!&quot; Birdie's granddaughter Mallorie 
    (Meegan Warner; <B><A HREF="scare_campaign_2016.htm">SCARE CAMPAIGN</A></B> 
    - 2016), gets a call from Birdie's doctor and he tells her that 
    Birdie needs a new caretaker. Little does Mallorie realize is that 
    the caretaker will be her. She was raised by Birdie when she was a 
    child after Mallorie's mother disappeared when she was four <A HREF="caretaker_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/caretaker 2016 poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="139" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>and
     just four months ago, she moved in with fiance August (Sean 
    Martini), so he goes along with Mallorie to take care of Birdie, but 
    the old lady takes an instant dislike to August (She says to him, 
    &quot;I wonder who is going to die first, you or me?&quot;) and warns 
    him not to have any type of sexual activity in her house (she makes 
    him sleep on the couch). Mallorie remembers Scarlett and Birdie gives 
    it to her, but whenever she holds it at night, she sleepwalks calling 
    August's name and August has to put her back to bed. Mallorie and 
    August put an ad in the newspaper for a new caretaker (Sebastian, 
    played the late Irwin Keyes, in one of his last films, shows up and 
    fills in the hole left by the last caretaker, but August thinks he is 
    too weird to take care of Birdie), but they can't seem to find anyone 
    who hasn't worked for Birdie before and has been fired by the old 
    bat. Birdy becomes more and more unhinged and so does Mallorie in her 
    own way, which worries August, who goes sees a psychiatrist to see 
    what she thinks about Mallorie's sleepwalking. The psychiatrist gives 
    August signs about Mallorie to look for. Mallorie and August find a 
    red folder full of documents which fill in the blanks and the 
    question now is: Can they ever leave this house? A search of the 
    attic gives them the answer (It is full of old VHS tapes and a creepy 
    room that awakens something in Mallorie). You have all the clues you 
    need to figure out how director/producer Jeff Prugh (his first horror 
    film) and screenwriter/producer Jeremy Robinson's (also his first 
    horror movie) film is going turn out (The only new caretaker to show 
    up is a Spanish woman, who takes one look at Birdie and calles her a 
    &quot;Bruja&quot;, Spanish for &quot;witch&quot;, and quickly leaves 
    the house.). While not a bad film, it is merely a regular one 
    (There's even a music video of Birdie and August dancing!), as Sondra 
    Kerr Blake (who was once married to accused murderer/actor Robert 
    Blake for 22 years) is simply terrifying as Birdie and Sean Martini 
    is awful as August (it was his first acting gig and it shows). Those 
    looking for lots of blood and gore and going to be very disappointed, 
    because this is more of a supernatural gothic thriller. Believe it or 
    not, Irwin Keyes, who is in this film for not more than two minutes, 
    won a Best Supporting Actor award in a Feature Film from the 
    FANtastic Horror Film Festival in San Diego. Maybe it was their way 
    of paying tribute to a recently passed actor, one that I always 
    loved, too. Otherwise, this is nothing but standard DTV pablum. Watch 
    out for the scissors (and lipstick)!; <B><A HREF="fight_valley_2016.htm">FIGHT
     VALLEY</A></B> (2016) is an extremely poor actioner because it stars 
    real-life UFC/MMA female and male fighters and the story is about as 
    old as it comes. Director/screenwriter Rob Hawk at least had the 
    sense to fill the film with some well-known female UFC fighters 
    (Meisha Tate, a star of this film, defeated Holly Holm to become the 
    women's bantamweight champion of the UFC. Holly Holm, another one of 
    the stars of this film, defeated Ronda Rousey to become the women's 
    bantamweight champion of the UFC), but to even attempt to call them 
    actors is doing the acting profession a disservice. As actors, the 
    entire cast are good fighters. The story is as plain as it comes: 
    When her sister Tori (Chelsea Durkalec), a &quot;knockaround 
    girl&quot; (a girl who streetfights with no manager in streets and 
    alleys), is murdered by some unknown person, Windsor (Susie Celek) 
    gets into a series of fights to find Tori's killer, even though she 
    is not a fighter. Windsor gets some much needed help in 
    streetfighting by Jabs (Tate), who puts her through an 80's montage 
    (nearly the whole second third of the film) of ways to learn how to 
    become a fighter quick. She learns about &quot;Fight Valley&quot;, 
    the place where her sister was killed by a champion fighter named 
    Church (Cris &quot;Cyborg&quot;). The only problem is that you have 
    to get invited to go to Fight Valley, otherwise everyone there will 
    stomp your ass. It doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out how 
    this story ends, but the terrible acting from everyone involved 
    (especially Salvatore Franciosa as Windsor and Tori's father Gino, 
    also a Producer and Executive Producer) makes the film seem twice as 
    long as it really is. If you have never heard of this film, good for 
    you. I had to watch it. The women aren't especially good looking and 
    the nudity is kept to a minimum, but there is plenty of lesbianism 
    and foul language for ten action films. And the violence is kept to 
    the the outside (There is only one fight in the UFC fighting 
    octangle) and none of it is very well staged. This looks like an 
    action film if it was made by the late Jess Franco. That is not a 
    good thing. Avoid it. It makes the female UFC/MMA fighters look like 
    a bunch of foul-mouthed, gay pseudo-martial artists. Filmed mostly in 
    New Jersey. Believe it or not, a sequel has been announced!; I really 
    wanted to admire <B><A HREF="nocturne_2016.htm">NOCTURNE</A></B> 
    (2016) because some scenes are downright effective, but the film 
    slits its own throat, as it were, by using too many 
    supernatural/possession film clich&eacute;s and the ending is one 
    where we know the filmmakers didn't have a proper conclusion, so they 
    fell back on the worst clich&eacute; of all. The film, partially 
    financed by Kickstarter, opens with Jo (Clare Niederpruem) driving 
    her car down a road, continuously looking behind her like she is 
    being followed. She stops at a high school graduation party at 
    Isaac's (Darien Willardson) parents' house and it is the most anemic 
    graduation party on film in a long time (everyone else who graduated 
    is at another party with a live DJ). It consists of only six people 
    (seven later on in the film, but more on that later): Jo, Isaac, 
    Maren (Hailey Nebeker), Gabe (Jake Stormoen), Vi (Melanie Stone) and<A HREF="nocturne_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/nocturne 2016 poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    Jo's ex-boyfriend Liam (Colton Tran, the best actor in this film, who 
    is a regular partying teen, but still dishes out quotes from the 
    Bible). Isaac is not only the town jock, but he is also an excellent 
    magician, as he proves to everyone by performing an unusual magic 
    trick involving two folded playing cards. Maren gets the idea of 
    performing a seance using an ouija board (What low-budget possession 
    film doesn't have one?), but Isaac doesn't have one, so they make 
    their own on a table using half a deck of playing cards representing 
    the alphabet, &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; written on the table 
    and an upside down wine glass as a planchette. Personal questions are 
    asked and everyone has dark secrets that come out (including Liam 
    cheating on Jo) and something happens to Maren (yes, she becomes 
    possessed, not by any old spirit, but by the Devil himself!). After a 
    soak in a hot tub where Maren, Liam, Isaac and a reluctant Jo (who 
    refuses to take her shirt off) play a game of &quot;Never Have I 
    Ever...&quot; (The possessed Maren says, &quot;Never Have I Ever had 
    sex.&quot;), everyone plays a game of Strip Blackjack, where the 
    losers who go above 21 have to take off a piece of clothing or take a 
    shot of Jack Daniels. Maren never loses a hand, as she hits 21 nearly 
    every time, even though Isaac is a magician and tries to make her 
    lose. Jo takes all her clothes off except her shirt, when she starts 
    drinking shot after shot for losing hands. Toward the end of the game 
    where Jo is so drunk, she can't drink another shot, Liam says the 
    game is over, and as Jo gets up, Gabe grabs her and drunkenly tears 
    off her shirt by mistake, revealing a lot of freshly-made huge 
    bruises on her back caused by her drunk father Hank (Corey Sondrup). 
    I guessed that was who Jo was looking for following her when she was 
    driving in the beginning of the film. I was wrong (kind of). Maren 
    (who now has the uncanny ability of saying the same exact things 
    everyone else says at the same time they say it) then goes on a 
    killing spree, first killing Gabe by making love to him and burning 
    him to death. Vi is next, as she is locked in the bathroom, has some 
    of the top of her fingers burned, has some teeth removed, as she 
    spits out blood and some molars and, in the most impressive moment, 
    Maren makes her cut her shoulder over and over with a lady disposable 
    razor and then makes her pull off her skin, where Vi bleeds to death. 
    Hank shows up to Isaac's house and wants to know where Jo is, but 
    Maren soon makes mincemeat out of him by pulling him under an 
    upstairs bed. Maren (who shows how evil she is by stepping on Isaac's 
    cat and crushing it to death) is threatened by Isaac with a gun, but 
    Maren makes him fire it towards Liam (just missing him) and then 
    putting a bullet through the floor (this shot is not by mistake). 
    Isaac disappears and wakes up in the covered hot tub, where Maren 
    turns up the temperature and boils him to death. When Liam looks for 
    where Isaac and Jo went, he finds himself suddenly trapped under the 
    floor. Remember the gunshot Isaac put in the floor? He hears the 
    discussion between Isaac and Maren from the time before and the 
    bullet shot through the floor hits Liam right in the neck, killing 
    him (The best sequence in the film because it shows a modicum of 
    thought). Jo is attacked by Hank under the bed, but she hits him with 
    a baseball bat and escapes through a shattered window (Just moments 
    before, none of the windows could be broken or the front door opened. 
    Jo hops out the window, only to be greeted by Maren on the lawn. Jo 
    hops in her car and takes off, driving her car down a road, 
    continuously looking behind her like she is being followed. The next 
    thing that happens almost made me throw my bottle of Coke at my TV 
    screen. Jo stops at Isaac's parents' house and Isaac says, &quot;I'm 
    glad you came to my party!&quot; Jo is doomed to relive this 
    nightmare for all eternity. Director, co-screenwriter, co-producer, 
    cinematographer Stephen Shimek (<B><A HREF="maze_2010.htm">THE MAZE</A></B>

    &amp; DRAGONS</A></B> - 2015 [which I didn't like]) keeps the budget 
    low by having a minimum of actors and they all do a pretty good job. 
    The last 30 minutes of the film (besides the convoluted ending) do 
    hold your attention, but all this has been done before and done much 
    better. Don't get me wrong, this is not a badly-made film, just one 
    you have seen done before under different titles. Some may like this 
    film a lot better than I do and I wouldn't blame you. Shimek does 
    have some talent and maybe with a bigger budget, he can wow me.</FONT></FONT></P>

     DTV Genre Films Part 20 (continued): <B><A HREF="isle_of_the_dead_2016.htm">ISLE
     OF THE DEAD</A></B> (2016) is one of those bottom of the barrel 
    &quot;SyFy Original Movies&quot; made by The Asylum, those pioneers 
    of awful films who make a mint off of copying big budget films at a 
    fraction of the cost (Fraction may be too much; lets say a pittance). 
    On an uncharted island, Colonel Aiden Wexler (D.C. Douglas) is trying 
    to make the perfect biological weapon: to create better soldiers that 
    don't die, but he creates mindless flesh-craving zombies instead. Ten 
    years later (Why ten years? Why not immediately?), a group of 
    highly-trained soldiers, including Lt. Paul Gibson (Joey 
    &quot;Whoa&quot; Lawrence; he actually says &quot;whoa&quot; in this 
    film, but not in his usual way) and Mikaela (Wrestling diva Maryse 
    Ouellet Mizanin, the wife of WWE superstar &quot;The Miz&quot;) are 
    sent to the island by helicopter to collect all the papers they can 
    find in the laboratory. The rest of the film is nothing but the 
    government military group being pared down by zombies as they shoot 
    the zombies in the head. Colonel Wexler, the scientist from the 
    beginning of the film, has injected himself with a serum that makes 
    him a zombie that can live forever, but he keeps all his memories and 
    can talk. Mikaela gets bitten by a zombie and injects herself with 
    the serum, turning her into the same type of zombie as the Colonel 
    Wexler. She gives the serum to Lt. Gibson, the last uninfected person 
    on the island and he is picked up by helicopter and nukes the island.

    no idea how to pace a film and the acting is so stiff here, you could 
    see branches growing out of their arms. Most of the shots to the head 
    are done by CGI, which also takes you out of the film. This film is

    bikini. The rest of the film is the same old story about being 
    prevented from coming to shore by an evil-tempered shark. Nancy 
    (Lively) takes a vacation to the favorite Spanish surfing spot of her 
    late mother (much to the dismay of her father and friends, one who 
    was supposed to go with her, but got sick). She goes out about 100 
    yards and sees something that upsets her: a dead whale with a big 
    chunk bitten out of its side. Soon she is the only one in the area 
    and a shark (both real life footage and mechanical) goes after her, 
    biting her surfboard in half and forcing her to take refuge on the 
    body of the dead whale. It seems that every time Nancy ends up in the 
    water, she gets hurt and this time she has a nasty cut on her upper 
    thigh, so she uses her belt to fashion a tourniquet to stop the 
    bleeding. After what seems like a lifetime, where she watches two 
    divers with cameras being killed by the shark and finds one of the 
    cameras (head not included because this is a PG-13 film) and makes a 
    &quot;save me' video before throwing the camera towards shore, she 
    hops on board a huge metal buoy (but not before getting hurt for like 
    the fourth time) and must fight the shark and kill it in a way not 
    seen before. It is not graphic, but it is interesting. OK, there are 
    two reasons to watch this film. A small Spanish boy finds the camera 
    and gives it to the young Spanish guy Carlos (&Oacute;scar Jaenada) 
    who drove Nancy to this location and he finds her on the shore as she 
    is spitting water out of her mouth. So the camera &quot;save me&quot; 
    video did her no good (it just took up time to make the film feature 
    length) and she had to rely on her own wits to kill the shark. Not 
    exactly original, but the shark's death is. A year later, Nancy (with 
    a hugh shark bite scar on her leg), brings her young sister Chloe 
    (Sedona Legge) and Father (Brett Cullen) to the exact spot where she 
    was attacked to teach Chloe how to surf. Is Nancy out of her mind or 
    is she working out some issues from her mother's death? Who fucking 
    cares?. Director/Executive Producer Jaume Collet-Serra (<B><A HREF="house_of_wax_2005.htm">HOUSE

     ON 7TH STREET</A></B> - 2010) are lazy in their approach of Nancy's 
    urgency. Case in point: Nancy finds a seagull with a dislocated wing 
    (listed as &quot;Sully 'Steven' Seagull&quot; in the credits) and 
    fixes its wing so it can fly. This is not one minute after being 
    attacked by the shark. The entire film is full of scenes such as this 
    (not to mention flares from a flare gun that get wet and only fly 
    about 20 yards, even though flares were made to work when they are 
    wet), which takes any reason the film could have had tension-wise out 
    of contention. If you just want to see Blake Lively in a teenie 
    bikini, fine. But if you want to see a scary film about a killer 
    shark, look someplace else.; <B><A HREF="lights_out_2016.htm">LIGHTS OUT</A></B> 
    (2016) is another one of those PG-13 Rated horror films which manages 
    to show as little as possible while throwing in plenty of jump scares 
    just for the hell of it. Based on the popular 2013 internet short of 
    the same name by David F. Sandberg (who also directed this film), 
    this is one of those &quot;make a horror film for less than $5 
    million dollars and get your money back (and then some) the first 
    week it is in theaters&quot;. This film went on to make nearly $22 
    million in its first week (and $67 million before its run ended in 
    the U.S., plus $90 million worldwide), making Sandberg the new 
    &quot;it&quot; horror director (He was hired immediately to direct <B><A HREF="annabelle_creation_2017.htm">ANNABELLE:
     CREATION</A></B> [2017; which made over $35 million on its opening

    - 2014, another low-budget, high financial return horror film). One 
    good thing I can say about this short, 81-minute, film, is that it 
    gets to the action right away. The stepfather of a family (a cameo by 
    Billy Burke of TV's <B><A HREF="zoo_tv_series_2015.htm">ZOO</A></B>) 
    and his female assistant Esther (Lotta Losten, in her feature film 
    debut) are killed by some demon who is afraid by the light. We then 
    go on to meet disillusioned stepdaughter Rebecca (Teresa Palmer; <B><A HREF="point_break_2015.htm">POINT
     BREAK</A></B> - 2015), her stepbrother Martin (Gabriel Bateman; the

     GOTHIC</A></B> - 2016, and one of the stars of <B><A HREF="annabelle_2014.htm">ANNABELLE</A></B>

     ON PRECINCT 13</A></B> - 2005), who once spent a couple of years in 
    a mental institution and somehow brought a demon named Diana (Alicia 
    Vela-Bailey) home with her to keep her company (Diana was once a 
    human friend of Sophie's in the institution and then died, turning 
    her into some kind of demon, which proves that all mental cases may 
    not be what they seem); Sophie's only stipulation is that Diana does 
    not hurt her family in any way. Martin is the only human living in 
    the house with Mom (Rebecca has her own place, and her boyfriend, 
    Bret [Alexander DiPersia], keeps trying, and failing, to get at least 
    some space to put some clothes so he can stay the night), so when 
    stepdad dies and Martin is shaking worse than a 8.0 earthquake, 
    Rebecca decides to move in with Sophie and Martin. Immediately, they 
    are attacked at night when the lights go out, so they learn to carry 
    flashlights and other means of light that don't depend on electricity 
    or battery (Diana can turn off all those devices). In short, Sophie 
    learns never to trust demons and ends up putting a bullet in her 
    brain to save her kids. No Sophie, no Diana, right? The film makes 
    you think so, but if you buy the DVD or Blu-Ray of the film, there is 
    an extra on how the film really ended, but advanced audiences hated 
    it so much, it was cut out of the film (In this instance, I think it 
    was a good idea, although a germ of an idea still remains). All we 
    ever get to see of Diana is her thin silhouette and grotesque hands, 
    which burn when light touches them. Sandberg decided to keep the 
    effects practical (the same way with the light, which makes some of 
    the action difficult to see), which is all fine and dandy, except 
    there are few physical effects in the film. Poor Alicia Vela-Bailey 
    had to wear a photorealistic prosthetic suit, so when the lights went 
    on, her body would disappear from the camera using the green screen 
    technique. While not the worst of the films of this type (<B><A HREF="ouija_2014.htm">OUIJ</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="ouija_2014.htm">A</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">

    recommend here. Which tells me one thing: Just because a short film 
    is successful, doesn't mean a full-length film based on that short 
    will have the same effect. This may scare children, but <A HREF="attack_of_the_lederhosen_zombies_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/attack of the lederhosen zombies 2016 poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>adults

     OF THE LEDERHOSEN ZOMBIES</A></B> (2016), a German film (filmed in 
    English, but the few portions filmed in German are subtitled) that is 
    about as funny as watching a live cat being dissected. The plot is 
    simple as can be: Climate change has reduced the amount of snow at 
    ski resorts (this one was filmed at the Mountains of South Tyrol, 
    Italy), so inventor Franz (Karl Fischer) has created a green liquid 
    that can produce instant snow that he hopes to sell to an investor. 
    At the same time, two champion snowboarders, Josh (Oscar Dyekj&aelig;r
     Giese) and Steve (Laurie Calvert), jump out of a helicopter, with 
    Steve's girlfriend/producer of this documentary, Branka (Gabriela 
    Marcinkov&aacute;), telling Steve that there is someone important 
    waiting for him at the end point. Steve stops down halfway and strips 
    off all his clothes, only to find out the &quot;special guest&quot; 
    was a nine year-old terminal girl in a wheelchair. The backers of the 
    documentary leave the threesome to get home on their own, as they 
    take the helicopter is disgust and leave them in the lurch. Franz 
    shows the investor how the liquid he has created can make snow, but 
    something goes wrong with the machine and Franz gets a face-full of 
    his own liquid, which turns him into a zombie. As you can guess, he 
    begins turning all the lodge guests into zombies by biting them, so 
    our threesome, plus obese, buxom barmaid Rita (Margarete Tiesel, the 
    best thing about this film), try to find a way to get to 
    civilization, which is impossible by snowboard or skis and they only 
    have one snowmobile (At a ski resort? C'mon now!). Rita saves their 
    asses more times than I can count (the only really good death is when 
    she drops a hinged trap door from a ceiling and it decapitates a 
    zombie). If you are a zombie comedy fan, I'll leave the rest for you 
    to discover, but director/co-writer Dominik Hartl (his first feature 
    length horror feature; his film before this was a romantic comedy) 
    piles on the gore, as you will see ripped-off body parts, intestines 
    falling to the ground, zombies taking big bites out of people and 
    even some zombie deer (fake-looking, but funny). Zombie fans may like 
    this, but I have seen too many to make me appreciate them unless they 
    have a special hook. I was watching this one and thinking to myself: 
    &quot;This is nothing but a seasonal change take on director Jorge

    cheap Producer Jason Blum and his BlumHouse Productions, known for 
    making horror films for less than 5 million dollars and more than 
    making a huge profit in the first week alone. Well, Blum has ventured 
    into Western territory and you can tell this is a BlumHouse film 
    because it has a small cast and only takes place in two areas: A town 
    called Denton and the area surrounding the town (filmed in New 
    Mexico). The plot is simple: An Army<A HREF="in_a_valley_of_violence_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/in a valley of violence poster6 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    deserter named Paul (Ethan Hawke; a BlumHouse regular, with films 
    such as <B><A HREF="sinister_2012_sinister_2_2015.htm">SINISTER</A></B> 
    [2012] and <B><A HREF="purge_2013.htm">THE PURGE</A></B> [2013] made 
    with Jason Blum as Producer), who accidentally killed an Indian woman 
    and adopted her dog, illegally leaving the Army in the process, is on 
    his way to Mexico, when he stops at the town of Denton to stock up on 
    water and supplies. He has sworn to God never to kill a person again, 
    but in Denton, that is an impossibility. At first, Paul knocks out 
    Gilly (James Ransone) for threatening to kill his dog. He is warned 
    by the wooden-legged Marshal (a very interesting John Travolta, who 
    seems to be becoming the new king of DTV) that Gilly is his son, so 
    he better leave town and never come back (Marshal is not a bad man; 
    he is just concerned for his family), even though a girl named 
    Mary-Anne (Taissa Farmiga) has taken an instant shine to Paul (her 
    sister Ellen [Karen Gillan] is pregnant with Gilly's baby). Paul 
    leaves town with his dog and camps out for the night only to be 
    awakened by Gilly and his gang (which includes Larry Fessenden, Toby 
    Huss and Tommy Nohilly) and Paul is forced to watch Gilly shoot and 
    then knife his dog to death. Paul is then thrown off a cliff and left 
    for dead, but the next morning, we see that he didn't fall more than 
    20 feet, as a ledge stopped him from falling all the way down. Paul 
    talks to God and tells him that he is sorry that he is going to have 
    to break his word about killing, as he vows to get even with everyone 
    who killed his dog (Where have we seen that scenario before?). Paul 
    steals a drunk priest's (Burn Gorman) mule and heads back to Denton, 
    where he begins to pick off Gilly's posse one-by-one. It doesn't take 
    a brain surgeon to know how this film ends. Hell, you don't even have 
    to have a brain at all. Marshal is the only one who has sense enough 
    to try and work things out between Paul and Gilly, but Gilly wants a 
    High Noon shootout in the middle of the town's only street and kills 
    his own father to get to Paul. Paul is injured, but gets the upper 
    hand on Gilly by first hanging him (&quot;Why did you kill my 
    dog?!?!&quot; he says to Gilly over and over) and then by beating him 
    across his face with Gilly's own boot, still yelling the question. 
    Paul stops because his injury is serious, so Gilly slowly gets up and 
    pulls out the knife that killed the dog and plans to now use it on 
    Paul. Mary-Anne shows up and shoots and kills Gilly in the back and 
    the film ends as the drunk Preacher enters the town. THE END. Besides 
    Travolta's interesting performance, this film has nothing going for 
    it. It is cheap to the extreme and it takes forever for some action 
    to take place. And we have seen the same plot done over and over at 
    least a hundred times and done much, much better. I don't know what 
    people see in Ti West, but he just seems like a hack to me. Not worth 
    your time unless you are a John Travolta fan.;<A NAME="Ouija3-2016"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="ouija_3_the_charlie_charlie_challenge_2016.htm">OUIJA 3: 
    THE CHARLIE CHARLIE CHALLENGE</A></B> (2016) is another horror flick 
    based on a &quot;Creepy Pasta&quot; story created in 2015 (in other 
    words, it's not based on reality at all) that exploded across the 
    world thanks to feeble minded kids who thought it was true (just like 
    the 'Slenderman' and the 'Rake' Creepy Pastas). The Charlie Charlie 
    Challenge is very simple: all you need is <A HREF="ouija_3_the_charlie_charlie_challenge_2016.htm#CharlieCharlieBoard">a
     piece of paper and two new pencils</A>. Balance one of the pencils 
    on top of the <A HREF="ouija_3_the_charlie_charlie_challenge_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ouija 3 amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>other
     on the piece of paper, which has &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; 
    written on the four opposite corners of the paper and ask a simple 
    question, such as &quot;Charlie Charlie, can you play?&quot; If the 
    balanced pencil moves to &quot;Yes&quot;, you can ask any yes or no 
    question you like, but you must close the game properly when done 
    asking questions, otherwise Charlie will kill everyone involved in 
    his summoning. This pitiful film opens with two female teens about to 
    play the game, but both of them are too scared to ask the first 
    question, so they get their roommate, Ryder (Abby Joy), who is 
    studying for finals, to ask the first question, which she does and 
    then walks away back to her room. Before she can make it there, she 
    is struck by a blue-colored optical effect and is knocked out, while 
    her two roommates are heard screaming. When Ryder wakes up, she finds 
    her two friends dead (one of them is in the closet, her body impaled 
    on metal hangers!). The film then switches to the owner of a haunted 
    house attraction, Gene (Tom Zembrod; <B><A HREF="#HighMoon">HIGH MOON</A></B> 
    - 2018), also known as &quot;The Ringmaster&quot;, upset because his 
    attraction is attracting zero people, forcing him to close early. He 
    is so much in debt, he hasn't paid any of his employees for over two 
    weeks, but he comes up with the bright idea to bring customers back 
    to his haunted house when he hears the news story on TV about Ryder 
    being arrested for the murder of her two roommates, but they have to 
    release her for lack of evidence. Gene invites five overage teens to 
    his haunted house to play the Charlie Charlie Challenge, locking them 
    inside the house, while his employees try to scare the crap out of 
    them. The five teens are headed by boyfriend/girlfriend team of 
    Charlie (Mason Dauti) and Sarah (Marissa Chibli) and also includes 
    intelluctual scaredy-cat nerd Skeeter (Aaron Green), fifth wheel Pete 
    (Dillon Vineyard) and Gina (Amanda Knapic), who always has her nose 
    buried in her cellphone (When Gene makes the group hand over their 
    phones so they cannot contact anyone outside, Gina later pulls out a 
    second phone and once again walks around with the phone at nose 
    level, not understanding why no one else has a second phone 
    [&quot;Doesn't everyone?&quot;, she asks amazingly!]). Gene's 
    employees, who include hothead Paulie (Todd Jenkins; <B><A HREF="#Arsenal2016">ARSENAL</A></B> 
    - 2016); who walks around with a shovel for some reason), Jerry the 
    Clown (Cliff McClelland; his makeup is quite good) and Stoner Stanley 
    (Cody Berry, who is dressed in a ridiculous-looking giant sombrero 
    and fake moustache, while smoking pot from a pipe and eating a sub 
    sandwich!), are supposed to walk the halls of the haunted house and 
    scare the five teens, but we all know they will be fodder for 
    Charlie, right? Gene regales the teens with an on-the-fly made-up 
    story about Charlie, saying he was a Mexican child who was sacrificed 
    and has come back from Hell to get revenge. He then leaves the teens 
    to play the Charlie Charlie Challenge, which they do, and pretty soon 
    they are being hunted down by the blue-colored optical effect and 
    killed, along with Gene's employees. Ryder then shows up at the 
    haunted house attraction to save the remaining teens, by properly 
    closing out the game with the pencils they used to summon Charlie, 
    but Gene now has them and throws them outside so they cannot retrieve 
    them, as all the doors are locked (Hey, kids, ever think about 
    breaking a window?) and Gene believe the teens killed his employees 
    (Why???). I can't begin to tell you how awful this film is. First 
    off, it's played as a comedy, as Tom Zembrod (also the Executive 
    Producer and Co-screenwriter<A HREF="ouija_3_the_charlie_charlie_challenge_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ouija 3 poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    [among other duties] of this piece of sludge) as Gene overacts 
    shamelessly, while the rest of the cast doesn't act much at all 
    because their characters are so underwritten (it also doesn't help 
    that they are lousy actors), it's hard to root for anyone (Gene gets 
    all the best lines. I wonder why? Hmmm...). Director/Story Writer 
    Derek Presley (<B><A HREF="cronus_2017.htm">CRONUS</A></B> - 2017) 
    hasn't got a handle on the any of the action going on here, as there 
    is practically no bloody gore and the violence is pulled back when it 
    should be going forward. There's also some secondary plots going on, 
    one about a horny married man parked outside of the haunted house 
    attraction who tries to get the woman he is having an affair with to 
    have sex with him, but she's having nothing of it, wanting to be 
    taken to a fancy hotel before she will put out. It goes nowhere to 
    help the very slow pacing of the film (The man ends up masturbating 
    in the car in front of the woman!). Another secondary story is the 
    Sheriff (Mitch 'Taco' Bell; yes, that's the way he is listed in the 
    credits), who would rather sleep in his car than investigate a 911 
    call made by Ryder to come to the haunted house attraction because 
    people are being murdered. Really??? It also goes nowhere. If you 
    think you are ever going to get a look at Charlie, think again, 
    because all we see of him is just the blue-colored optical effect as 
    it chases the cast around the haunted house. But, wait, there is one 
    positive thing I can say about this turgid flick! It was filmed at an 
    actual haunted house attraction, the Hangman&#146;s House of Horrors 
    in Fort Worth, Texas, and some of the rooms are actually quite well 
    done, even if director Derek Presley doesn't take full advantage of 
    them. This is a horror film without any horror, with comedy so bad it 
    went out with Vaudeville and acting that belongs in an Ed Wood film. 
    In other words, there's nothing here that is worth your time. If you 
    think this film is your cup of tea, make sure you stay tuned after 
    the closing credits to learn of Gene's fate, because I couldn't give 
    a flaming fart.</FONT></FONT></P>

    (2016) was a real mental institution that was a large complex located 
    in Nankin Township in western Wayne County, Michigan (filmed on 
    location) from 1832 until a tragic fire in 1984 closed it down (in 
    real life the fire was in 2016, but it did close down in 1984), and 
    in this fictional horror film, it killed many patients and a crazy 
    psychiatric doctor named Dr. H.H. Greiss (Robert Patrick; <B><A HREF="lost_after_dark_2014.htm">LOST
     AFTER DARK</A></B> - 2014), who treated all his patients based on 
    their worst fears, ending up in causing many deaths. In the present, 
    grease monkey Jacob Martin (Chace Crawford; <B><A HREF="haunting_of_molly_hartley_2008.htm">THE
     HAUNTING OF MOLLY HARTLEY</A></B> - 2008), who owes a lot of money 
    to bill collectors and has a stack of &quot;Past Due&quot; letters, 
    learns from a lawyer that his estranged father has died. He agrees to 
    meet the lawyer the next day, who tells Jacob that his father has 
    left him an estate worth $1.2 million, but there is a problem. Unless 
    he can dig up a death certificate for his aunt, who was a patient at 
    Eloise since 1965, he will have to wait seven years to inherit the 
    estate. Needing the money bad, Jacob and his friend Dell (Brandon T.

    - 2015) search the internet for someone who is an expert on Eloise 
    and comes up with Scott Carter (P.J. Byrne; who overacts terribly), 
    who is the brother of barmaid Pia Carter (Eliza Dushku; <B><A HREF="wrong_turn_series_2003-2014.htm">WRONG
     TURN</A></B> - 2003). She is against Scott showing Jacob and Dell 
    the asylum, but eventually agrees. They all sneak into the asylum and 
    almost immediately they begin to see things that no one else can see. 
    They eventually end up in 1965, where Dr. Greiss performs a lobotomy 
    on Scott by pushing a metal rod into the corner of his eye and 
    hitting the rod hard with a hammer, killing him (Thank God, he was 
    really getting on my nerves.). Dell goes mad and has a gun in which 
    he shoots at imaginary people and he soon ends up dead. Jacob and Pia 
    are eventually captured, where Dr. Greiss makes them face their worse 
    fears. Jacob is claustrophobic and fears on being buried alive, so 
    Dr. Greiss locks him inside a coroner's cold storage area in one of 
    the small coffin-like spaces in the mortuary. Pia has a huge fear of 
    needles and is subjected to a nurse sticking hypodermic needles in 
    her arm over and over and drawing blood. Pia eventually escapes and 
    takes a nurse uniform, walking the halls looking for Jacob. She finds 
    him and frees him by opening the mortuary cold storage door and they 
    try to get the hell out of Eloise. They see Jacob's aunt have a baby 
    and then die by bleeding to death. It turns out to be Dr. Greiss' 
    baby boy, but a nurse puts it in a box with holes poked in it and 
    gives it to a small girl, who runs away with it. The finale is so 
    inexplicable that I was scratching my head raw, as Jacob is the 
    reason why the fire started in 1984 and only Pia is left alive. We 
    then see Jacob in a small cage as Dr. Greiss approaches him and the 
    film ends with the camera pointed at a painting of a young boy next 
    to a dog. Huh? I must have missed something, as director Robert 
    Legato (His first film, his normal job being a visual effects 
    supervisor) and screenwriter Christopher Borrelli (<B><A HREF="marine_franchise_2006-2015.htm">THE
     MARINE 2</A></B> - 2009) offer nothing new, except for some 
    weird-looking patients that inhabited the institute and an unusual 
    dance between the nurses and the patients. Everything else is DTV 101 
    and the blood and gore is kept to a minimum. Only Scott's death 
    registers as something worth watching. While not badly made, you can 
    skip this one because it is nothing but your regular DTV movie. Fun

    (2012). Instead of three guys going to a bar, with one of them 
    wearing eyeglasses with a camera hidden in it, meeting a strange girl 
    named Lily (Hannah Fierman; <B><A HREF="gone_by_dawn_2016.htm">GONE 
    BY DAWN</A></B> - 2016), who says &quot;I like you.&quot; before 
    killing and eating two of them in a motel room and flying off with 
    the one with glasses (Lily is some kind of gargoyle creature), this 
    film fleshes out Lily's story (also played by Fierman). Four guys 
    drive to Garden City to have a bachelor party for Jonah (Chase 
    Williamson; <B><A HREF="john_dies_at_the_end_2012.htm">JOHN DIES AT 
    THE END</A></B> - 2012), including Jonah's brother Mac (Michael Aaron

    2016), his best friend and best man Rand (Hayes Mercure) and friend 
    Elliott (Randy McDowell), for a night of drunken debauchery. They hit 
    a bar that turns out to be a dud, but a stranger lets them know about 
    an underground club called &quot;50n / 40w&quot; where their are 
    plenty of nice girls to party with. They meet the club's owner, Mr. 
    Nyx (Justin Welborn; <B><A HREF="signal_2007.htm">THE SIGNAL</A></B> 
    - 2007), who escorts Jonah to a glass booth where he can see a naked 
    Lily and worries about her because she looks like she is being kept 
    prisoner (she is). Jonah breaks Lily out of her booth and they, along 
    with the other three escape from the club. Pretty soon they notice 
    Lily is extremely strange, as she says &quot;I like you&quot; a lot 
    to Jonah. Mr. Nyx and his posse, including a woman named Ash 
    (Brittany S. Hall), who has black worm-like creatures instead of hair 
    on her head (you have to see what she does with them!), are not far 
    away trying to get his star attraction back, when Lily and the guys 
    stop at a convenience store to pick up some food and drinks, but Lily 
    sprouts wings and flies away with Jonah to God knows wherein the 
    woods and she makes love to him before he escapes and runs into Ash. 
    Lily eventually returns, because she really does like Jonah, but the 
    other two guys are somewhat reticent about spending more time with 
    her and for good reason. Jonah begins falling for Lily, as Mr. Nyx 
    captures Lily and Jonah and Rand. Nyx has a special necklace that 
    keeps Lily in line, as they all are in an abandoned church used for 
    satanic rituals. Mr. Nyx is so pissed at Lily, he wants Jonah to 
    control Lily (who is naked throughout the entire film) with the 
    necklace, but Jonah refuses and Mac shows up in time to save both 
    Lily's and his brother's lives, but Mr. Nyx kills Mac by stabbing him 
    in his stomach and slitting his throat with his knife and he 
    approaches Jonah and a tied-up Rand to kill them. Lily sneaks up 
    behind him (and also uses her singing voice to control people) and, 
    when he turns around, she shoves her pointy tail through Nyx's mouth 
    and out the back of his head. Lily wants to go with Jonah, but he 
    tells her it will never work. Besides, he is in love with his fiance 
    Eva (Lindsey Garrett). One year later, one their first anniversary, 
    Jonah and Eva have sex in the upstairs bedroom and Jonah goes 
    downstairs to get something to drink out of the refrigerator, when he 
    notices Eva asleep on the couch. Jonah realizes he just had sex with 
    Lily and she attacks Eva, ready to kill her. Jonah tells Lily to stop 
    and he will go with her. The final shot is of Lily flying through the 
    air to God knows where with Jonah as her passenger. While not an 
    awful film (at least it is not a found footage film like <B>V</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">/</FONT></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B>H/S</B>),
     there is so much nudity in this film, you can spot the edits (but on 
    the other hand, besides a couple of &quot;fucks&quot;, all the foul 
    language is kept in the Chiller TV version) and we do get to see 
    frequent shots of Lily's naked ass. Besides a creepy Hannah Fierman 
    as Lily, the only other actor to register is Justin Welborn (<B><A HREF="crazies_2009.htm">THE

    much better CGI), but the problem is how do you upgrade something 
    that doesn't need upgrading? Though Bishop tries unique ways to cover 
    Lily's naked breasts and vagina, a lot of the nudity is blurred out. 
    Get the Unrated DVD if you want to see the entire magilla. But don't 
    expect more than what you saw and heard on the Chiller TV version. I 
    never heard so much swearing and foul terms used for body parts on a

     ORIGIN OF EVIL</A></B> (2016) and it only grossed $14 million the 
    first week of release and it was one of his company's biggest 
    disappointments, earning just $31 million in U.S. theaters (The first 
    film earned over $105 million in theaters on a $5 million budget). 
    Director/co-screenwriter Mike Flanagan (<B><A HREF="absentia_2011.htm">ABSENTIA</A></B> 
    - 2011, an arthouse horror film that I love) at least keeps the 
    prequel true to the first film as, in 1967, a mother and her two 
    daughters, after the death of their husband/father after he is hit by 
    a drunk driver (The mother being a fake medium), get an Ouija Board 
    and nine year-old daughter Doris (Lulu Wilson) becomes possessed by 
    the evil spirits in the house, where, in the basement, there is a 
    secret room where a Nazi doctor (&quot;The Devil's Doctor&quot;) 
    performed evil experiments on people, killing them. Like in all 
    horror films where Ouija Boards are used, the evil is terrible (well, 
    as terrible as a PG-13 film can get) and the older daughter Lina 
    (Annalise Basso) ends up sewing Doris' mouth shut (we don't see her 
    do it, just Lina going through the actions with a doctor's hook with 
    thread attached to it) and is then taken over by the evil spirits, 
    kills her mother Alice (Elizabeth Reaser) and ends up in a mental 
    asylum, where there is a shock ending (Once again the killing of the 
    mother is implied, not shown). Henry Thomas also stars as Father 
    Thomas, the Principal of the Catholic school where Doris and Lina are 
    students, who tries to help the family, only to be possessed and then 
    have his neck snapped by Doris in the basement, who crawls on the 
    ceiling and throws the Father onto the basement stairs. The only 
    effective scenes in the film are when Doris explains in detail what 
    it feels like to be strangled to Lina's new boyfriend Mikey (Parker 
    Mack), Doris being able to open her mouth wider than any human is 
    able to, a 78 rpm record music score made up of 1920's songs for 
    &quot;atmosphere&quot; and an effective stinger after the end credits 
    that links it directly to the first film that takes place in the 
    present (I'll never tell!). The problem with this film is that, if it 
    were Rated R, it would be allowed to show much of the violence that 
    this film pulls away from (there is also a scene involving a 
    slingshot that would have been much more effective with an R-Rating). 
    All it is is jump scares and evil faces made by Doris (Lulu Wilson is 
    the best actor in this film. You actually believe she is evil as she 
    grabs people by their head, whispers something into their ears and 
    they all end up possessed and then usually dead, all except for 
    Lina). I'm beginning to hate seeing the BlumHouse logo in the 
    beginning of horror films because I like about 10% of them. The only 
    reason most of them are Rated PG-13 is because they can put more 
    asses in the theater seats than with an R-Rated film. And they suck 
    for this reason alone. Avoid it like the plague.;<A NAME="Incarnate2013-2016"></A> 
    Speaking of Jason Blum and BlumHouse Production, there's the terrible <B><A HREF="incarnate_2016.htm">INCARNATE</A></B> 
    (2013/2016), another one of his PG-13 Rated horror films with a 
    budget of $5 million that they hoped would clean-up at the boxoffice. 
    Whoops, it only made $6,337,659 by the end of 2016, making it one of 
    BlumHouse Productions' biggest money losers in their career (But, 
    believe me, they can afford to have ten money losers. A 2016 poll of 
    the best money making film companies show BlumHouse to be Number One 
    with $6.30 returned for every dollar a person spends to see their 
    movies, making it a 630% profit!). Right away, I had the sense that 
    this film had some production troubles (I was right. It was filmed in 
    November 2013, released in December 2016, and the end credits lists 
    an &quot;Additional Photography&quot; team. And just what did the WWE 
    have to do with this film?) because the film only runs 80 minutes, 
    followed by 10 minutes of <A HREF="incarnate_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/incarnate 2016 poster6 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>the
     slowest moving end credits I have seen in quite a while (to pad out 
    the running time). The storyline is rather idiotic. Dr. Ember (the 
    always capable Aaron Eckhart; <B><A HREF="suspect_zero_2004.htm">SUSPECT
     ZERO</A></B> - 2004) loses his wife and young son in an accident 
    caused by a demon named Debbie (A demon named Debbie? Was she a 
    cheerleader in real life? You have to be kidding me!). Dr. Ember is 
    now permanently in a wheelchair, but ever since he was young, he had 
    the ability to enter in the mind of people possessed by demons and 
    bring them back to reality, but doing so is dangerous to him because 
    he has to be temporarily dead in order to do it. For most of his 
    life, he has hidden his gift, but since the death of his wife and 
    child, he has brought his power out into the open, using his 
    associates Oliver (Keir O'Donnell; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Amusement2007">AMUSEMENT</A></B> 
    - 2007) and Riley (Emily Jackson; <B><A HREF="headless_2014.htm">HEADLESS</A></B> 
    - 2014) to make sure he is dead for no more than ten minutes and then 
    bring him back to life before his death is permanent. Dr. Ember is 
    always on the lookout for the demon Debbie to bring out into the open 
    (She cannot possess anyone if no one is near her and she can't 
    repossess the person she just possessed, Confusing, isn't it?). That 
    chance comes to Dr. Ember when Debbie possesses a young boy named 
    Cameron (David Mazouz; <B><A HREF="darkness_2016.htm">THE DARKNESS</A></B> 
    - 2016, another BlumHouse production) by entering the body of a 
    homeless woman and she crawls on the ceiling of his divorced mother's 
    Lindsey's (Carice van Houten; &quot;Melisandre&quot; in <B><A HREF="game_of_thrones_tv_series_2011.htm">GAME
     OF THRONES</A></B> [2012 - 2017]; her ex-husband, Dan [Matt Nable] 
    is an alcoholic, but he will soon end up dead) kitchen ceiling and 
    falls directly on Cameron, instantly possessing him (Walking on walls 
    and ceilings are a trademark of BlumHouse horror films). When Dr. 
    Ember discovers it is Debbie possessing Cameron, he and his team 
    enter Lindsey's house and set up shop. A priest friend gives Dr. 
    Ember a serum he should take when he draws Debbie out (the priest 
    ends up dead), which will give him 10 seconds to leave the room and 
    leave Debbie without a human body to possess, sending her permanently 
    to Hell. Like all BlumHouse productions, Dr. Ember does everything by 
    the book (he jumps out the window and eventually ends up dead), but 
    the ending shows that Debbie is still able to travel to another body, 
    leaving the film wide open for a sequel. But don't look for a sequel 
    to this film any time soon, since BlumHouse lost money on it. Just 
    like all their PG-13 films, there are jump scares, but very little 
    blood and you would think after sitting through 10 minutes of closing 
    credits, there would be a stinger or two, but no, it just ends. 
    Director Brad Peyton (<B><A HREF="san_andreas_2015.htm">SAN ANDREAS</A></B> 
    - 2015) does what he can with a confusing screenplay by Ronnie 
    Christensen, but when you are handed shit, it is almost impossible to 
    turn it into gold. And this film is a pure unadulterated Grade-A #1 
    steaming pile of shit. Nothing to see here, move on please, but watch 
    where you step!;<A NAME="AttackDonuts2016"></A> It's really hard to 
    like <B><A HREF="attack_of_the_killer_donuts_2016.htm">ATTACK OF THE 
    KILLER DONUTS</A></B> (2016), as sloppy continuity and a lackluster 
    script do it more harm than good. The story is about slacker Johnny 
    Wentworth (Justin Ray) who is in his mid-20's and still working at a 
    donut shop (which never seems to sell any donuts!). His mother 
    (Kassandra Voyagis) wants him to be more assertive and make something 
    of his life, but he's in love with Veronica (Lauren Elise), who uses 
    him as a bank and cheats on him as much as humanly possible. His best 
    friend since high school and co-worker, Michelle (Kayla Compton), 
    sees Veronica for what she really is and she has the hots for Johnny. 
    The killer donuts come into play when Uncle Luther (Micheal Swan, and 
    yes I know Michael is spelled wrong, but this film is full of 
    sloppiness) invents a serum to elongate human life and it accidently 
    gets tossed into the donut fryer, causing all the free donuts they 
    give away to grow teeth and attack the customers. The only known 
    actor in this exercize in tediousness is C. Thomas Howell (credited 
    as &quot;C. Tommy Howell&quot; in the closing credits) as Police 
    Officer Rogers (His partner's name is Officer Hammerstein. 
    &quot;Rogers &amp; Hammerstein&quot;. Get it? Ugh!!!!). He stops in 
    the donut shop to pick up some free donuts and a perp he has 
    handcuffed in the back seat of the patrol vehicle asks for a donut, 
    which he readily gives him. Big Mistake. The perp slams Rogers &amp; 
    Hammerstein's heads together and kicks the back door of the car off 
    and escapes (When the officers wake up, the door has been magically 
    attached back to the car. There are too many of these sloppy scenes 
    to mention.).&nbsp; The rest of the film is about Johnny, Michelle 
    and Johnny's good friend Brian (Burt Rutherford, who is fucking 
    Johnny's mother!) trying to stop the killing by getting back all the 
    donuts they gave away. While there are some gory scenes (including 
    the disgusting scene of the perp &quot;shatting&quot; himself to 
    death!), the story makes absolutely no sense and it is filmed in a 
    way that one scene begins with no connective tissue to the last 
    scene. Directed by Visual Effects Producer Scott Wheeler (which is 
    probably why the CGI killer donuts look better than they have any 
    right to), who has also directed films for The Asylum (<B><A HREF="journey_to_the_center_of_the_earth_2008.htm">JOURNEY
     TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH</A></B> - 2008), which would explain the 
    weak screenplay (It took three people to write this mess. I'll 
    refrain from naming them to protect the guilty.). While played as a 
    broad comedy, most of the jokes fall flatter than bread made without 
    yeast and a good percentage of the acting is way below-par. Do 
    yourself a favor and eat a bearclaw instead.;<A NAME="IslandZero2016"></A> 
    I really wanted to like <B><A HREF="island_zero_2016.htm">ISLAND ZERO</A></B> 
    (2016) since it started out so creepy and foreboding, but then it 
    turns into a cheesy CGI monster flick, destroying all the foreboding 
    creepiness. Everyone on a small island in Maine is stranded when the 
    ferry never shows up from the mainland. As fuel, electricity and food 
    become scarce, the residents begin turning on each other until an 
    ocean biologist (Adam Wade McLaughlin) tells them that there is an 
    &quot;apex predator&quot; out in the ocean, a creature that has thus 
    far been unknown to humanity. It turns out these creatures, who have 
    skin that refracts light, making them nearly invisible, are 
    intelligent and there is a person on the island who is not who he 
    says he is. He's actually a government agent sent to the island to 
    communicate with the creatures, who tear people in half and rip out 
    their innards, They are not only in the water, they can also survive 
    on land for short periods of time, so all the remaining residents 
    hide out in a house while the creatures attack. The sad fact is these 
    creatures are awful CGI creations and, while bloody and gory, they 
    are not that scary. Toss in a huge amount of coincidences (the 
    biologist's late wife was killed by one of these creatures; the 
    biologist's young daughter has a thermal camera, the only device that 
    can &quot;see&quot; the creatures; etc.) and people doing the 
    stupidest things and what you have left is a film that held promise 
    but falls apart rather quickly when the creatures are introduced. 
    Director Josh Gerritsen, working with a screenplay supplied by wife 
    Tess, does populate the film with real Maine actors, giving it an air 
    of authenticity, but the film, made in 2016, but not released until 
    2018, is no better than a SyFy original movie. Proceed at your own risk.;<A NAME="OneByOne2016"></A> <B><A HREF="one_by_one_2016.htm">ONE
     BY ONE</A></B> (2016) is a sick Spanish knock-off of <B><A HREF="i_spit_on_your_grave.htm">I
     SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE</A></B> (1978), but it is too disjointed and 
    badly acted&nbsp; to be worthwhile. The film opens with John (Steven 
    Jeram) delivering a satchel containing a huge amount of coke to 
    three-man motorcycle gang leader Cuchillo (Guillem 
    Fern&agrave;ndez-Valls). We then see John<A HREF="one_by_one_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/one by one poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    bragging to girlfriend Sentenza (Elisabetta Montonato) that they are 
    now rich because he cut the coke he gave to Cuchillo and they can now 
    go anywhere they please. Sentenza says that it is dangerous to cheat 
    such a mean person, but John tells her not to worry, if and when 
    Cuchillo finds out the coke is cut, they will be so far away, he will 
    never find them. So what happens next? That's right, Cuchillo and his 
    gang of two, Rider (Carlos Reyes) and Santos (Oliver Novelles), show 
    up right where John and Sentenza are lounging (they don't even try to 
    hide themselves!) and Cuchillo rapes Sentenza while Rider and Santos 
    beat the crap out of John. When Cuchillo is done, he gives Sentenza 
    to his mates and they rape her, too. When they are done, they put 
    John in a hole, pour gasoline on him and set him on fire 
    (off-screen). Sentenza watches her boyfriend burn alive (all we hear 
    are his screams) as the gang rides away (Rider and Santos want to 
    kill Sentenza, but Cuchillo says leave her alone, she will not cause 
    any trouble. Yeah, right!). Sentenza then toughens herself up, 
    learning how to shoot a gun (by herself!), ride a motorcycle and 
    other things she will need, so she can kill Cuchillo and his gang one-by-one.
     First of all, this film looks like it was edited with a trowel, as 
    things just happen without any rhyme or reason, such as the scene 
    where Cuchillo and his gang have the detective (Sebi Alcaraz) 
    assigned to the case tied to a pole as Cuchillo skins him alive with 
    his sharp knife, finishing him off by pinning his badge on his bare 
    chest and Cuchillo then sticking his knife into his mouth. We have no 
    idea how Cuchillo and his gang captured the detective, he just shows 
    up tied to a post. Sentenza then sees the detective tied to the post 
    and shoots him in the head! The only reason I watched this short film 
    (It only runs 71 minutes, but the film itself only runs 63 minutes, 
    the rest of it is the very long end credits), was because the 
    synopsis read: &quot;It contains one of the most vicious scenes in 
    cinema.&quot; That &quot;vicious scene&quot; would be Cuchillo 
    capturing another girl named Samantha (Cintia Ballb&eacute;), but 
    instead of raping her, he stabs her over and over in the vagina with 
    his knife, the camera giving us a close-up view of him doing it! It 
    comes out of nowhere (Cuchillo tells Rider and Santos that they are 
    going on a &quot;cunt hunt&quot;!) and took this viewer by surprise, 
    but it seems that it was only added to shock the audience, as it does 
    nothing to advance the plot, which is paper-thin anyway. While we 
    expect Sentenza's revenge will be nasty, it isn't, because she just 
    simply shoots them one-by-one, no blood, no gore, they just die, even 
    Cuchillo. Freshman director/screenwriter Stefan Ruf (whose next film 
    would be <B><A HREF="sex_terrorists_on_wheels_2018.htm">SEX 
    TERRORISTS ON WHEELS</A></B> - 2018) has no idea on how to frame a 
    scene, even when Sentenza traps the gang in an area where there are 
    many hand-made crosses sticking out of the ground. He also tries to 
    get us to believe that this is taking place somewhere in the western 
    United States, but everyone has Spanish accents, some so thick, I had 
    to turn on the subtitles to understand what they were saying! Even 
    though it runs a little over an hour, it seems three times as long, 
    as Ruf also tries to get us to believe that Sentenza taught herself 
    how to become a silent killer who is an expert with a gun and a 
    motorcycle, failing spectacularly. Don't waste your time with this 
    one, folks, it is not even good for an unintentional chuckle. The 
    music soundtrack sounds like some cheap Spaghetti Western knock-off. 
    If you must watch it, Amazon Prime offers it streaming, free to Prime 
    members. All non-members have to pay for the &quot;privilege&quot;.;<A NAME="Flora2016"></A> <A HREF="flora_2016.htm"><B>FLORA</B></A> 
    (2016) can be considered an arthouse horror film, where nature runs 
    amok, but it is far too long and contains some sloppy writing, as 
    well as some amateurish acting, to be anything but an acquired taste. 
    I should have known something was wrong when the posters for the film 
    claims it won many awards at film festivals around the world, but as 
    we all know, that means nothing in real life. The film takes place in 
    1929 at <A HREF="flora_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/flora dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>some
     unknown thick forest (filmed in Canada), where a crew of Ivy League 
    college students, some of them botanists, are studying the local 
    flora. They become trapped in the area when they discover that all of 
    their food supplies have been burned by their professor, who has 
    disappeared, leaving no clues as to where he has gone. With the 
    nearest drop-off of supplies a month away, the group must find a way 
    to survive, but food is scarce, because there are no animals in the 
    forest, no fish in the water&nbsp; and no insects anywhere to be 
    found. What could cause all living things, besides plants, to 
    suddenly disappear? It turns out to be a new kind of fungi, which 
    travels around just like pollen, has infected all living, breathing 
    things, causing them to die painful deaths. The fungi begins to kill 
    members of the group, who are going hungry and must find something to 
    eat, causing their throats to close and die from lack of oxygen. The 
    remaining four of the group still left alive decide to walk to some 
    railroad tracks over 200 miles away, in hopes of stopping a train and 
    getting themselves away from harm. Not only is this hard to swallow 
    for the viewer (pardon the pun), especially since the fungi seems to 
    have the capacity to think and strike back (!), as the survivors walk 
    every day wearing gas masks and gear to keep the fungi from infecting 
    their lungs, clothes and body. Only one of them survives and makes it 
    to the railroad tracks. She hears a train approaching and the film 
    ends with the survivor looking towards the unseen train. This film 
    leaves more questions unanswered than answered (How do you stop a 
    train on the tracks when there is no station for it to stop at? Do 
    you throw yourself on the tracks and hope the train stops?) and the 
    way the fungi attacks the group is very uneven, especially one the 
    last persons to get infected. It's just very sloppy writing. The film 
    also runs about thirty minutes too long, as I was hoping for the film 
    to conclude, but it kept slogging along until the uneventful ending, 
    where I threw up my hands in frustration, hoping for a sensible 
    ending, but not getting it. Freshman director Sasha Louis Vukovic 
    sure could have used an editor for his screenplay, especially some of 
    the hoary dialogue, which tries to get us believe the &quot;hip&quot; 
    1920's dialogue, but it just doesn't sound normal coming out of the 
    mouths of the amateur actors, many of them who were also producers of 
    the film. One of the members even brings a gramophone into the forest 
    and uses it as his personal iPod! Some of the make-up effects are 
    excellent, but there's really not much to recommend here besides some 
    lush, colorful photography, which is nearly ruined by the digital 
    cameras being used to film this flick. Some people may enjoy this 
    meandering film, but those looking for a decent eco-thriller are 
    advised to look elsewhere. This isn't the film for you. Watch <B><A HREF="long_weekend_1977.htm">THE

    (2016) begins like a house o' fire, but quickly degenerates into 
    boring and quite familiar territory. In the woods of Northern 
    California, a marijuana grower named Brock (an excellent Bill Sage; <B><A HREF="fender_bender_2016.htm">FENDER
     BENDER</A></B> - 2016) has created a highly potent version of 
    crystal meth, but both he and his girlfriend Peggy (an equally 
    excellent Sabina Gadecki) are doing something no dealer should ever 
    do: sampling their own product and sampling it hard (Gadecki's makeup 
    is true of most meth addicts. Her lips are cracked and burned [from 
    smoking meth out of a hot glass pipe] and the skin on her face is 
    discolored, pocked and full of scab marks, making her look much older 
    than she is). Brock also believes that his marijuana farm is being 
    invaded by aliens, as he swears that he was once abducted by aliens, 
    but escaped and they have been after him ever since. As both he and 
    Peggy smoke a lot of this &quot;super meth&quot; (Peggy much more 
    than Brock), Peggy shares in his belief of aliens and swears she has 
    seen them, too. Trouble gets big when Brock's niece Courtney 
    (Anastasia Baranova; TV's <B><A HREF="z_nation_tv_series_2014.htm">Z NATION</A></B> 
    {2014 - 2018]) visits Brock unannounced and brings her best friends 
    with her (you know, the typical horny, sexed-up and pot-smoking 
    &quot;teens&quot;, who go crazy when they discover the marijuana 
    farm). The &quot;aliens&quot; start killing Courtney's friends in 
    various bloody ways (usually by beheading and then tearing their 
    bodies apart), but are they really aliens? I really wanted it to be 
    aliens, but in the back of my mind I knew it was Brock and Peggy 
    doing the killings and, sure enough, I was right. The problem with 
    this film is that anyone can guess what happens next and it usually 
    does. After Courtney's friends are murdered, Peggy chops-up the 
    bodies and puts the pieces in special plastic bags, as 
    &quot;proof&quot; aliens do exist (She believes, in her methed-out 
    mind, that the body parts are alien in origin). While the film has 
    some excellent bloody effects, director Trevor Ryan and his 
    screenwriting brother Tim Ryan (billed as &quot;The Ryan 
    Brothers&quot;) have fashioned a film with no surprises (Dolph 
    Lundgren [<B><A HREF="war_pigs_2015.htm">WAR PIGS</A></B> - 2015] is 
    involved in the film is a very weird way; as an actor on a detective

    (2016) could have been a good film, but freshman director Robert 
    Lawson Gordon fills his screenplay with one unbelievable plot 
    contrivance after another that you will throw your hands in the air 
    and yell out, &quot;REALLY???&quot; The contrivances start nearly 
    from the first frame, where we discover Tom Redding (producer Will 
    Hurst) is being supported by girlfriend Jamie (Karin Lee), as Tom is 
    a college student who is trying to find a subject for his film 
    documentary final thesis (Never mind that Tom looks at least fifteen 
    years older than any college student I know!). Tom then gets a phone 
    call from a lawyer telling him that his mother is dead, she committed 
    suicide and he is needed right away. Tom tells Jamie that he never 
    really knew his mother since she deserted his family when he was just 
    a young boy, but he decides to make the trip to the lawyer just to 
    see why he is needed. Tom then drives to the lawyer's office, where 
    he discovers his mother left him her house close to Mount Shasta in 
    California. The lawyer then hits Tom with another big bit of news: 
    Turns out he has a sister named Chloe, but she is not quite normal 
    and has been spending time in a mental hospital since their mother's 
    suicide. Tom insists on seeing Chloe (Grainne McDermott) at the 
    hospital, where Dr. Jorgenson (Mindee de Lacey) tells him that his 
    sister hasn't moved a muscle for years, as<A HREF="i_know_youre_in_there_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/i know you're in there dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    she just sits motionless in a wheelchair, not speaking and not 
    moving. Dr. Jorgenson tells Tom there is no medical reason why Chloe 
    is doing this and it's best if she stays in the hospital for proper 
    treatment, as she has to be bathed, dressed and fed by the staff 
    since she can't do it on her own. Now this is when the film really 
    goes off the rails. Tom decide s he wants to live in his mother's 
    house, sight unseen, and insists that he will take care of Chloe by 
    himself and secretly document her condition for his college 
    documentary thesis.&nbsp; Dr. Jorgenson tells Tom that is a bad idea; 
    he doesn't know how much work it will be to take care of his sister's 
    needs, but Tom is adamant, takes Chloe out of the hospital and 
    promises to call Dr. Jorgenson twice a day to update her on Chloe's 
    condition. Wanna bet? Tom tells Jamie that she needs some time away 
    from him and she agrees (Tom is an idiot), giving him two weeks 
    before she comes to his mother's house to visit him, so Tom drives a 
    motionless Chloe to his mother's house, documenting evey aspect of 
    the trip with his camera (He talks to Chloe as if she will talk back 
    to him, but she never does...yet). Before you can say, &quot;Boo! 
    Strange things are about to happen!&quot;, strange things begin to 
    happen at his mother's house. Items seem to move and suddenly 
    disappear by themselves and the room Chloe was staying in when their 
    mother was alive has a strong padlock and chain attached to the door. 
    Was that to keep somebody from getting in or somebody from getting 
    out? Long story short, Tom begins to unwind rapidly. We learn early 
    in the film that he's a recovering alcoholic and nearly as soon as he 
    arrives at the house he begins drinking heavily. He believes Chloe is 
    faking her condition and begins to leave a camera in her room to 
    record her to see if she ever moves. When he plays back the footage, 
    just when it looks like he is going to prove Chloe is a fake, the 
    footage gets all static and wonky, blurring out what is actually 
    happening. When two weeks pass and Jamie arrives, she immediately 
    sees that Tom is losing it, so she tells him to put Chloe back in the 
    hospital, quit drinking and come back home. Chloe then begins talking 
    to Tom, telling him that Jamie must be silenced, as she is 
    interfering in a serious brother/sister relationship. But is Chloe 
    actually talking to Tom or is Tom certifiably bonkers? If you went 
    with the latter, you would be correct, for when Tom photographs Chloe 
    talking to him and Jamie plays back the footage, she discovers that 
    Tom is actually supplying Chloe's voice. Will Jamie be able to leave 
    when Tom won't give her the keys to her car? Will Jamie be a murder 
    victim to Tom's psychopathology? Is Chloe actually faking it? Does 
    the film end on a note that's just as unbelievable as the rest of the 
    movie? What do you think? There is an interesting plot to this film, 
    but it is so heavy-handed and the denouement is telegraphed nearly 
    from the beginning that an infant could guess it, the germ of a plot 
    is destroyed rather quickly. Just the fact that Tom wants to take 
    care of Chloe after being with her for only a few minutes, says a lot 
    about how stupid this film actually is. No rational person would ever 
    make that decision so quickly without looking at her medical records 
    and taking the advice of her doctor, but Tom does it anyway. There is 
    no reason to watch this film, which is like a no-budget mash-up of <B><A HREF="carrie_1976.htm">CARRIE</A></B> 
    (1976) and <B><A HREF="shining_1980.htm">THE SHINING</A></B> (1980) 
    and about 50% of it is &quot;found footage&quot; (half the film is 
    seen through Tom's camera), but it is so idiotic, it's best avoided 
    just for the sake of your sanity. It could have been good, but 
    director/screenwriter Robert Lawson Gordon drops the ball quickly and 
    it never recovers. So far (it's September of 2020 as I write this) he 
    hasn't directed his sophomore feature film effort yet, if he is ever 
    allowed to.</FONT></FONT></P>

    The entire time I was watching <B><A HREF="shadow_people_2016.htm">THE
     SHADOW PEOPLE</A></B> (2016), a wave of deja vu rushed over me, as 
    if I had already seen the film. It turns out I was right, this is 
    nothing but a cheap remake of 1973's <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Nightmare1973">NIGHTMARE</A></B>,
     starring David Hemmings and his then-wife Gayle Hunnicutt. In this 
    update, Andrew (Bug Hall) is driving his wife Megan (Kat Steffens) 
    down a dark street in the pouring rain so they can get to their new 
    house. A girl darts out in front of the car, causing Andrew to swerve 
    off the road and into some mud, the car getting stuck. Rather than 
    calling and waiting for a tow truck, they decide to run the quarter 
    mile to their new home. Yes, these people are idiots. As soon as 
    Megan enters her new home (she is a painter and Andrew is a 
    successful author of books on the paranormal, but is not a believer. 
    Of course he isn't!), she begins to catch quick glimpses of 
    horrifying-looking faces staring at her through the house's many 
    windows with their mouths wide open, as if they are trying to tell 
    her something. These &quot;Shadow People&quot; include an old man and 
    woman, a man in a cowboy hat and a sinister priest (played by C. 
    Thomas Howell). As the days and nights pass and the rain never lets 
    up, Megan continues to see these Shadow People, but Andrew refuses to 
    believe her, even though they are very much in love (it's sickening 
    the way they continue to kiss and fondle each other!). Andrew 
    believes Megan has a high fever and wants to take her to a doctor, 
    but she refuses to leave the house, even swinging a hoe at him to get 
    him to stop dragging her out of the house (&quot;This is MY 
    house!&quot;). When fires starts breaking out in the house for no 
    reason at all, Megan begins to get worse and worse and Andrew fares 
    no better, as Megan keeps seeing him dead in bed. So, are the Shadow 
    People to blame, as Megan<A HREF="shadow_people_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/shadow people 2016 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="164" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    explains to Andrew that she has the &quot;gift&quot; to see them ever 
    since her grandfather told her they were real (and dying soon 
    afterward)? Legend states that if you begin seeing Shadow People, 
    that means you don't have very long to live. Andrew still doesn't 
    believe, that is until he sees the priest, who begins quoting the 
    Last Rites at them both. What's the kicker? If you haven't guessed 
    already, in the beginning of the film, their car did not survive the 
    near hit of the girl. Instead, the car overturns and Andrew dies at 
    the wheel. A mortally wounded Megan is trapped in the car, which is 
    on fire, as an emergency crew worker (in a cowboy hat) and an elderly 
    couple tell her to hold on, the jaws of life will get her out or the 
    car. Once out of the car, a priest (Howell) gives Megan the Last 
    Rites, tells her to &quot;let go&quot; and then she dies. Yes, 
    everything that seemingly happened for days and nights on end was 
    going through Megan's mind in a matter of minutes, as she is sitting 
    in the overturned wrecked car next to her dead husband, slowly dying 
    in the pouring rain. This two-character supernatural horror film, 
    directed by Brian T. Jaynes and written by David Wilson, is a total 
    rip-off of the previously-mentioned 1973 film, and it can't begin to 
    hold up when compared to that film, as the two actors here are no 
    Hemmings or Hunnicutt by a long shot (Who in the hell would name 
    their son &quot;Bug&quot;?). All this film has are one jump scare 
    after the next and, truthfully, they aren't that scary. C. Thomas 
    Howell is in the film for two minutes maximum, even though he gets 
    star billing (it could have something to do with him being one of the 
    Executive Producers on the film!). Overlong at a mere 78 minutes, it 
    seems three times as long, as the film just plods along, Andrew 
    continually praising his love for Megan and she for him, even if he 
    doesn't believe a word she is saying. This film is so cheap that when 
    Andrew calls for the Sheriff to come over when he sees the evil 
    priest, it cuts to Megan waking up after passing out and Andrew 
    telling her the Sheriff arrived, but then left when he didn't see 
    anything! I realize that this is all fragmented due to Megan's dying 
    condition, but it could have been done so much better with some 
    talent in front of and behind the camera. As it stands now, it's just 
    a boring supernatural tale with a pay-off that anyone with a working 
    brain could see coming. Avoid at all costs. You'll thank me later. 
    Not to be confused with the film <B><A HREF="shadow_people_2012.htm">SHADOW
     PEOPLE</A></B> (2012), which is a much more truthful (although 
    equally boring) take on the legend.;<A NAME="HotelDamned2016"></A> <B><A HREF="hotel_of_the_damned_2016.htm">HOTEL
     OF THE DAMNED</A></B> (2016) almost ended up in the &quot;Good&quot; 
    portion of this section except for one thing: The camera keeps 
    pulling back when it should be pushing ahead. Otherwise, it's a 
    decently acted film with some atmospheric sequences. American 
    criminal Nicky (Louis Mandylor; <B><A HREF="frankenstein_syndrome_2010.htm">THE
     FRANKENSTEIN SYNDROME</A></B> - 2010; who also was one of the 
    Producers) is released from a Romanian prison (filmed on location) 
    after serving five years for some unspecified crime. Meeting him 
    outside the prison is old friend/criminal partner Jimmy (Peter 
    Dobson; <B><A HREF="frighteners_1996.htm">THE FRIGHTENERS</A></B> - 
    1996; who was also an Executive producer here) and he wants to know 
    what they should do next (This film is interesting in the way it 
    doesn't adhere to standard timeline filmmaking, as it is full of 
    flashbacks and flash-forwards that clues us in on what is going on, 
    but I'm going to explain it in a straight linear fashion). Nicky and 
    Jimmy go to a boxing gym and Nicky beats the snot out of the owner 
    before Jimmy shoots him in the head. The owner apparently owed the 
    duo a large amount of money that he never paid them, so they take it 
    out of a safe in his office and put it in a satchel (I can only guess 
    that Nicky was in prison for robbery). Nicky then tells Jimmy that he 
    wants to see his daughter Eliza (Roxana Luca), so they go to the home 
    of Nicky's ex-wife Maria (Manuela Harabor), only for her to tell 
    Nicky that Eliza has turned to stealing all her money and jewelry and 
    has run away with her junkie boyfriend Bogdan (Bogdan Marhodin). 
    Maria doesn't know where Eliza is, but she tells Nicky and Jimmy that 
    Bogdan hangs out under a nearby bridge with his drug-addled friends. 
    The twosome go to the bridge and &quot;confront&quot; Bogdan's 
    friends (with a pipe and a baseball bat!), where they learn that 
    Eliza has turned into a junkie prostitute and that Bogdan plans to 
    sell her as a prostitute in Italy (Nicky doesn't take the news too 
    well and beats the crap out of Bogdan's friends, while Jimmy pummels 
    another one with the baseball bat). They <A HREF="hotel_of_the_damned_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/hotel of the damned amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>learn
     that Eliza and Bogdan are at a local sleazy motel, so they go there, 
    where Nicky sees Eliza half-naked and Jimmy pulls a nude Bogdan out 
    of the shower and brings him to Nicky. Eliza tells her father 
    something that he doesn't want to hear, saying that she is a junkie 
    whore and blames him for it. Bogdan tries to bribe Nicky with drugs, 
    so Nicky knocks him out and puts him in the trunk of his car (without 
    Eliza's knowledge) as he, Jimmy and Eliza drive to the airport for 
    America. As they are driving, they hit a screaming half-naked girl 
    and the car careens off the road and flips down a steep hill. While 
    the car lays on the ground overturned and wrecked, we see two rather 
    large bald men with machetes kill the screaming girl and carry her 
    off. The first one out of the destroyed car is Nicky, as we watch him 
    pull large shards of glass out of his leg. He checks on Eliza and 
    she's bloody, but not hurt seriously. Jimmy, on the other hand, is 
    severely injured, with broken ribs and hardly able to walk. Bogdan 
    then escapes from the trunk, basically unhurt, and Nicky makes him 
    survey the area looking for help or shelter since their cell phones 
    don't work there (an overused horror trope). Bogdan finds an 
    abandoned, creepy hotel nearby and tells Nicky about it. Nicky 
    decides everyone will stay there for the night, unaware that it is 
    the home of a family of grungy, dirty Nazi cannibals (!) who haven't 
    had an American meal for decades (they are the people who killed the 
    screaming girl). Eliza tells her father that she saw someone looking 
    at her when she was in the bathroom, so Nicky and Jimmy search the 
    hotel and find the cannibal family feasting on the screaming girl, 
    the head of the cannibal family (Floran Kevorkian) chowing down on 
    one of the girl's eyes! The rest of the film is basically nothing but 
    Nicky, Jimmy, Eliza &amp; Bogdan trying to escape from the cannibals, 
    who don't seem to understand that guns are more powerful than 
    machetes, but it's a rather large family. Who will survive this 
    onslaught and who will become the cannibals' next Happy Meal? That's 
    all there is to this film, which is basically nothing but a copy of 
    the <B><A HREF="wrong_turn_franchise_2003-2014.htm">WRONG TURN</A></B><A HREF="wrong_turn_franchise_2003-2014.htm"> </A><B><A HREF="wrong_turn_franchise_2003-2014.htm">franchise</A></B> 
    (2003 - 2014), but both Louis Mandylor and Peter Dobson make the film 
    more enjoyable than it has any right to be. Mandylor is memorable as 
    a father who is disappointed in his daughter and has a severe hatred 
    for Bogdan for turning her into a junkie prostitute, but both 
    Daughter and Boyfriend redeem themselves before the film is over, 
    which came as quite the surprise, especially on Bogdan's part, where 
    he sacrifices himself so everyone else can get away. Dobson is also 
    quite good as Nicky's sidekick, who says some very funny things 
    (usually as quick asides) and admires Nicky, standing by his side 
    until he, too, becomes cannibal chow. But this film's main problem is 
    that the camera pulls back when something gory is about to happen, as 
    besides the very brief scene where we see the cannibal family eating 
    the screaming girl (who is being roasted over a spit of fire!), we do 
    not see any more cannibal action and hardly any other gore (Parts of 
    the film, such as when Nicky pulls out the shards of glass from his 
    leg, are shot very dark). I have to say that I did enjoy this film to 
    some extent, but it could have been much, much better. The non-linear 
    storyline was quite pleasing, that is until they ran out of ideas for 
    the flashbacks and scrapped the idea halfway through the film. 
    Directed by Bobby Barbacioru (his feature film debut) and written by

    Mandylor was to star and Bercovici was to write, but it's the latter

    bad. Maybe it would have fixed the problems I had with this 
    film.;&nbsp; <B><A HREF="my_little_sister_2016.htm">MY LITTLE SISTER</A><A NAME="MyLittleSister2016"></A></B> 
    (2016) is nothing but torture porn Italian style. And we all know how 
    much I love torture porn (insert sarcasm here). The film opens with a 
    crazy old woman (Lucia Castellano) deep in the woods, playing with 
    leaves and dirt as if she wants to make love to it. We then see a 
    masked madman, &quot;Little Sister&quot; (Saverio Percudani), whom we 
    soon learn is named Igor (My, how original!). His mask is made out of 
    the faces of his former victims (My, how original!) and we see him 
    with three of his victims: Jessica (Astrid Di Bon), who is topless 
    and tied to a post; her boyfriend James (Antonio Pauletta), who is 
    chained to a wall, his head strapped in place to he can't move it; 
    and Nadine (Sofia Pauly), whom is fully-clothed and tied to a table. 
    Igor walks into the room, where he has some foreplay with everyone 
    with his knife, before slicing off James' face with a scalpel, 
    putting the skin in a bowl of liquid and then pulling out a 
    gas-powered weed whacker (the kind with metal blades), which he uses 
    to disembowel Nadine before cutting off her limbs. Jessica manages to 
    free herself and run away, but we'll see more of her later in the 
    film. We then see couple Tom (Mattia Rosellini) and Sheila (Holli 
    Dillon) prancing about in the forest, unaware that they are being 
    followed. They search for the campsite of their friends, James, 
    Nadine and Jessica, and find it, but all three of them are missing 
    and they can't call them on their cell phones because there is no 
    service (My, how original!). Suddenly a man with an axe, Ben (David 
    White; <B><A HREF="#DieIn1Day2017">DIE IN ONE DAY</A></B> - 2017; 
    another bad Italian horror film), appears and tells them to leave<A HREF="my_little_sister_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/my little sister amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    before Little Sister gets them, just like he probably got their 
    friends. Sheila makes fun of Little Sister's name, but Ben tells her 
    this is no joking matter; if they want to live, they will leave the 
    forest immediately. Of course, they don't listen to him and bed down 
    in one of the tents for the night, where they have sex (My, how 
    original!), when suddenly Sheila hears a noise outside. It's Ben and 
    he says they are very stupid for staying and he can no longer be 
    responsible for what happens next. Ben kills the romantic mood, so 
    Sheila and Tom sit in the tent, now scared. Igor, er, I mean Little 
    Sister, then strikes, swinging his axe into the tent over and over, 
    striking Tom several times, but Sheila escapes and runs away. Little 
    Sister drags a still-alive Tom away to his torture room, while Sheila 
    finds a house where a long-dead corpse is watching a VHS tape 
    containing home movies of Igor when he was a young boy. Igor and his 
    loving father are working outside together in the blazing sun, when 
    he asks Igor to fetch him another bottle of water, unaware that 
    Igor's sister is videotaping the entire thing. Igor grabs a bottle of 
    water that is sitting on a table and brings it to his father, who 
    opens it and pours it on his face, unaware that Igor's sister 
    replaced the water with acid, as their father screams on the ground, 
    the acid eating away his face. Turns out the corpse watching the tape 
    is Igor's father and the house she is in contains Igor's torture 
    room, so Sheila searches the house, finds Tom in the torture room and 
    they both escape, but Tom dies a short time later in the forest. 
    Sheila finds a still-alive Jessica and they both decide to get 
    revenge on Igor, but Jessica is captured and is tortured to death 
    (graphically). Then Sheila does something so outrageous, you won't 
    believe your eyes. She cuts off Tom's face and puts the skin over her 
    face, pretending to be Igor's mother! She manages to kill Igor and 
    when she is leaving, the crazy old woman we saw in the beginning of 
    the film offers Sheila an apple, which she eats. She then gives 
    Sheila a bottle of water to drink and when she swallows it, it turns 
    out to be acid and Sheila dies a horrible death. Yes, that crazy old 
    woman was Igor's sister! The film ends on that note. Directed by the 
    brother team of Maurizio &amp; Roberto del Piccolo, this film moves 
    at a snail's pace, even though it is very violent. Everyone speaks 
    English, but their accents are almost impossible to understand and 
    the dialogue was recorded so low, even a hearing aid wouldn't help (I 
    turned on subtitles when I watched it streaming on Amazon Prime, just 
    so I could understand what the fuck was being said!). This film 
    doesn't miss one horror trope, from the slow-moving Igor always being 
    ahead of Sheila no matter how fast she runs to having sex in the 
    woods even though their friends are missing. All I could do was <A HREF="red_christmas_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/red christmas poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="214" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>say,
     &quot;My, how original!&quot; at this film's total lack of 
    originality. Just stay away and watch something else. For torture 
    porn freaks only.;<A NAME="RedChristmas2016"></A> I love horror 
    movies made in Australia, but I must make an exception when it comes 
    to <B><A HREF="red_christmas_2016.htm">RED CHRISTMAS</A></B> (2016), 
    a horror film with a &quot;message&quot;. I have to admit I was 
    enjoying the film until the &quot;message&quot; kicked in. The 
    message is that this film is a Pro-Life Movement endorsement 
    disguised as a horror film. That's right, it forces down the viewer's 
    throat that abortion is a sin and that a baby's life begins at 
    conception, a &quot;fact&quot; disproven time and time again by 
    science, yet politicians and the clergy disagree, facts be damned. 
    Abortion is not what God or the conservative government wants! I 
    vehemently disagree, as people who believe in such things routinely 
    bomb abortion clinics, killing the people inside. If a baby's life is 
    sacred, isn't everyone's? Not to pro-lifers. This film starts with 
    such a bombing at an abortion clinic, where an aborted baby in a 
    plastic pail is found to be alive and taken home by the bomber.

    (Sarah Bishop; star and screenwriter of the Australian found footage 
    horror film <B><A HREF="last_ride_2011.htm">LAST RIDE</A></B> - 2011) 
    and her priest husband Peter (David Collins), Diane's Down Syndrome 
    son Jerry (Gerard O'Dwyer; <B><A HREF="#LittleMonsters2019">LITTLE MONSTERS</A></B> 
    - 2019; who actually has Down Syndrome) and adopted daughter Hope 
    (Deelia Meriel) are all gathered to celebrate Christmas and open 
    presents. Right away, we can see that these family members are quite 
    estranged, as Suzy and her husband Peter (who is obviously gay, 
    staring at Scott's naked ass when he makes love to Ginny in the 
    bathroom and when he gets caught by Joe, he goes to his bedroom after 
    grabbing a box of tissues and masturbates in a portable closet [which 
    looks like a confessional]!) have been trying to have a baby with no 
    luck and Ginny rubs her pregnancy is Suzy's face, Joe is a pothead 
    who offers no apologies, smoking it out in the open (occasionally 
    passing the joint to the pregnant Ginny), Ginny likes to say things 
    that hurt Diane, and Jerry likes to overeat cream pies, all to 
    Diane's displeasure. Diane is selling her house and taking a cruise 
    around the world, which makes her children very angry. She tells them 
    that their father, her husband, who died of cancer, made her promise 
    to sell the house and take the trip when she turned 65, telling her 
    it was time to think about herself for a change, but the children 
    (except for Jerry, who is being sent to an assistant living facility) 
    hate that their childhood home is being sold and blame their mother 
    for their unhappiness (all the children, besides Jerry, of course, 
    since he is &quot;special&quot;, are spoiled, morose brats). Then 
    something happens that will change all of their lives forever, as 
    short as that may be. They are visited by Cletus (Sam 
    &quot;Bazooka&quot; Campbell), a strange figure who mumbles (turn on 
    English subtitles to understand what he is saying) and is dressed in 
    a black hooded robe with layers of cloth covering his face, looking 
    like a modern-day version of the Elephant Man (and talking like him, 
    too), who knocks on the front door and says he wants to read a letter 
    (When we first see Cletus, he visits a farmer [Anthony Jensen] and 
    says that he is lost. The farmer looks at Cletus and says, &quot;You 
    are just wrong, boy!&quot;, tosses him to the ground and begins to 
    piss on him. Cletus then rips his penis off!). Diane lets him in, 
    over her children and Joe's objections, saying it's Christmas and 
    it's the time to show that we care (sure!). When Cletus doesn't know 
    what a present is, Diane gives him a jar of peanuts wrapped in 
    Christmas paper (Cletus says, &quot;It's the most beautiful thing I 
    have ever seen!&quot;). Cletus then begins to read his letter, 
    mentioning that he is the survivor of an abortion twenty years ago at 
    a clinic that was bombed. Diane gets very angry when he mentions the 
    name of the clinic and tells Joe to throw Cletus out of the house, 
    which he does, and Diane throws the jar of peanuts at him, beaning 
    Cletus on the head! We then learn that it was Diane who had the 
    abortion after learning that her baby was going to have Down 
    Syndrome. Since Jerry already has it and her husband was going 
    through chemo at the time for his cancer, Diane thought it was best 
    to have an abortion. She tells Peter this, since he is a priest, and 
    makes him swear not to tell anyone else, but since priests can't be 
    trusted (the only time this film wanted its cake and eat it, too) he 
    lets it slip and Jerry hears it, thinking his mother no longer loves 
    him and wants him dead, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Cletus 
    begins killing members of Diane's family one-by-one in various very 
    gory ways (but none of it done very convincingly), beginning with 
    Hope (of<A HREF="red_christmas_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/red christmas poster6a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    course, the adopted daughter is the fist victim; to pro-lifers, they 
    aren't considered family at all), whom he splits in half from head to 
    crotch with an axe. Scott has his head cleaved in half with the axe; 
    Joe is strangled in a car; Susy is impaled in the head with an 
    umbrella, which opens and spills her brain matter all over the ground 
    (!), Peter has his head ground with the blades of a kitchen mixer 
    until blood flies out of his eyes like a fountain; Jerry is 
    accidentally shotgunned dead by Diane when she mistakens him for 
    Cletus (this film's idea of &quot;irony&quot;) and Ginny is stabbed 
    to death while hiding in a giant stuffed bunny after delivering her 
    baby. The sheriff, who has come to save everyone, parks his car 100 
    yards away from the house (Why???) and Cletus kills him by tossing a 
    bear trap on his head, resulting in geysers of blood spurting from 
    his neck. Diane kills Cletus by impaling him with an anchor and 
    jumping out a window, hanging herself by the neck and decapitating 
    Cletis. We don't get a full view of Cletus' face until very near the 
    end of the film and I will say this: It is shocking and the best 
    aspect of the film. Only the baby is left alive at the film's 
    conclusion and the the biggest insult comes during the end credits. 
    As the end credits roll, it points us to some Pro-Life websites and 
    then suggests some films to watch that take the anti-abortion 
    political stance! Message films like this are why I hate films with 
    messages, especially horror films. It's no coincidence that the 
    newborn baby is the only life saved in this film, because to Pro-Lifers,
     that's the only life that counts, other human life be damned. 
    Weren't we all babies at one time? They rather not think about that. 
    While I enjoyed this film as a cheap horror flick (with acting from 
    Dee Wallace better than it needed to be), I can't honestly recommend 
    this as entertainment, thanks to it's rather large political slant. 
    If all aborted babies acted like Cletus in this film, wouldn't it be 
    better if they stayed aborted? Chew on that Pro-Lifers! And fuck you <B>RED

    (2016) is an Italian horror film by director/producer/cinematographer/editor/co-screenwriter
     Eros D'Antona (<B><A HREF="#DieIn1Day2017">DIE IN ONE DAY</A></B> -

    TO HELL</A></B> - 2018; a film I really liked). The biggest problem 
    with this <B><A HREF="insidious_trilogy_2010-2015.htm">INSIDIOUS</A></B> 
    trilogy (2010 - 2015) rip-off is that everyone speaks English and 
    it's plain to hear it's not their chosen language, as they speak it 
    so fast, it's really hard to understand what they are saying and the 
    auto-translated English subtitles don't help at all (Example: 
    &quot;The house has ghosts&quot; reads &quot;The horse needs 
    oats&quot; on the screen!). The film in a nutshell is this: Aspiring 
    writer Max (Roberto D'Antona) agrees to housesit for his sister Anna 
    (Annamaria Lorusso) and her young son Danny (Danilo Uncino) after her 
    husband commits suicide, causing Danny to go dumb. Anna wants to <A HREF="haunted_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/haunted 2016 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>take
     Danny away for two weeks so they can relax and get away from it all. 
    What Max doesn't know is that the house is haunted by seven Sumerian 
    demons: an old woman (portrayed by Robert and Eros' brother Alex 
    D'Antona); a naked woman with an ugly face who likes to slit her 
    wrists (the right way, up and down, not across); a little girl; and 
    others, including a demon who controls them all (a scrawl in the 
    beginning of the film states that once these seven demons invade your 
    house, they can never be forced to leave). Almost immediately, Max 
    begins to experience some strange shit, including knocking on the 
    front door, but every time he opens it, no one is there (he blames 
    the neighborhood kids, but not for long). Every time he locks the 
    front door, he finds it unlocked and open. He invites his sometimes 
    girlfriend Liza (Diandra Elettra Moscogiuri) to spend the night with 
    him, but as they are making love, Liza's face turns into the old 
    woman's hideous face and he throws up all over her, making Liza leave 
    immediately in disgust. Max tries to tell his best friend, musclehead 
    alcoholic Chris (Michael Segal), what is happening at the house, but 
    he doesn't believe him. He soon will when he spends two nights at the 
    house. Max then contacts an exorcist, Professor Sam James (David 
    White, a regular in all the D'Antona Brothers' films) and he comes to 
    the house, not to exorcise it, but to contact the demons and make 
    them leave on their own. It doesn't end too well, as the finale will 
    either leave you extremely mad or extremely satisfied. The real 
    problem with this film is that it is played as a broad comedy; 
    Michael Segal as Chris overplays his role so broadly (he's a sex 
    fiend, who watches a porn film in his mother's house, squirts some 
    lotion on his hands to masturbate and when Max calls him on his 
    cellphone, he answers it with his tongue!), that his character 
    becomes a parody. Some parts of the film are very funny, though, but 
    when the film turns very serious on a dime quite often, you will be 
    left wondering if the change in tone was worth it all, as the film 
    ends on a really downer of a note. Still, there are two good 
    jumpscares in the film, but a couple of scares don't make a good 
    film. It would have played better without the comedy, but it's not 
    really a bad film, just an ordinary one, enough for me to put it in 
    the bad category. I'm going to watch Eros D'Antona's <B><A HREF="#Insane2015">INSANE</A></B> 
    (2015) next, since it won some awards at film festivals around the 
    world, but one thing I have learned: even though a film may have won 
    awards at festivals I never heard of, it doesn't make it a good film, 
    but I love to be proven wrong (and I was!). Look for cameos by Mirko 
    D'Antona and Francesco Emulo, two of Roberto's favorite co-stars, in 
    roles as wisecracking police detectives. All of the Italian films I 
    mentioned in this review are available on Amazon Prime (at the time 
    this review was posted).;<A NAME="Brackenmore2016"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="brackenmore_2016.htm">BRACKENMORE</A></B> (2016) is a 
    supernatural horror film looking for some kind of hook, but doesn't 
    seem to find one. When Kate was a little girl, she caused the death 
    of her mother and father by screaming uncontrollably in the backseat 
    of the car (for some unknown reason, the car radio goes wonky at the 
    same time) as her father is driving, causing him to lose control of 
    the car and crashing it, killing her parents. Now a fully grown 
    woman, Kate (Sophie Hopkins) is living in London with her husband 
    Steven (Kieran Baker) and has no memory of the accident that killed 
    her parents, even though she is haunted every night by recurring 
    nightmares of her parents' deaths. It is obvious that Kate is a very 
    somber, troubled woman and her marriage is just as troubled, as she 
    and Steven sleep in separate bedrooms. Kate gets a letter from an 
    estate lawyer telling her that her uncle, whom she never met and 
    didn't know existed, has died and left her an inheritance: his home 
    and the thirteen acres of property it sits on in her ancestral home 
    of Brackenmore, a very small village in South Ireland. Steven wants 
    to go with her, but Kate sneaks out of her home early in the morning 
    and drives to Brackenmore by herself, leaving Steven a note. Once in 
    Brackenmore, Kate is forced to take a room in the home of Caroline 
    (Elaine Kennedy) and John Duffy (Bertie Brosnan), when she finds the 
    estate lawyer's office locked tight (she leaves him a note with her 
    cell phone number). Over dinner, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Duffy prove to be 
    extremely strange people. Caroline serves a dinner of meat stew, 
    which Kate thinks tastes funny, but she eats it all so she doesn't 
    upset her hostess. All Mr. Duffy wants to know is how long Kate is 
    going to be in Brackenmore, as he seems eager to see her leave. The 
    estate lawyer phones Kate and meets her at his office. He is also an 
    extremely strange man with greasy hair and he drives Kate to her 
    uncle's estate, which is now hers. Immediately after entering the 
    house, a feeling of deja vu rushes over Kate, as she gets the feeling 
    she's been in this house before. The estate lawyer tells<A HREF="brackenmore_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/brackenmore amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    Kate that her uncle killed himself (not telling her that he hanged 
    himself) and seems very anxious to leave the house. Entering the 
    house is local resident Tom (D.J. McGrath), a handsome young man, who 
    will be a part of Kate's life very soon. The estate lawyer tells Kate 
    that he has to leave and Tom will drive her to her car, but Kate says 
    that since this village is so small, she'll walk back to her car and 
    do a little exploring before she gets there. When the estate lawyer 
    leaves, Kate suddenly gets ill and throws up on Tom's shirt (I guess 
    Caroline's meat stew didn't agree with her). She apologizes to Tom, 
    but he takes it all in stride, telling Kate that in Brackenmore, 
    everyone knows everybody who lives here and he wants to know if Kate 
    is going to be their newest resident. Kate says she doesn't know and 
    she will have to think about it (Every time she phones Steven, she 
    gets his answering message. He never picks up.). It is obvious Kate 
    and Tom are beginning to have feelings for each other, but will they 
    act on them? And what does a strange symbol, seen everywhere in the 
    village and even on Kate's property, have to do with why the 
    residents act so strange? Tom chaperones Kate to one of Brackenmore's 
    festivals by the lake, where the residents wear masks and dance 
    around. Kate and Tom&nbsp; smoke a pipe filled with a local root, Tom 
    telling her everyone in Brackenmore smokes it; it's a tradition. Kate 
    becomes semi-conscious and when she comes to, she is in her house 
    with someone knocking on her door. When she opens it, she is attacked 
    by someone carrying a knife and wearing a white mask and a hooded 
    robe. The person tries to strangle Kate when she kicks the knife from 
    their hand, but Kate manages to pick up the knife and stab the person 
    through the neck, killing them, their blood gushing out of the wound 
    like a river and splashing all over Kate's face (It's quite bloody). 
    When Tom and a local constable arrive at Kate's house, the policeman 
    treats Kate like a perp, telling her he knew the young man she just 
    murdered, he was a good lad and accusing Kate of sexually coming on 
    to him and changing her mind once they arrived at her house. He 
    accuses Kate of murder and Tom tells him to get out of the house, but 
    the constable tells Kate that this is far from over. That's as far as 
    I'm going to go here, as this is a very slow-moving independent 
    chiller that will remind people of the much better <B><A HREF="wicker_man_1973.htm">THE
     WICKER MAN</A></B> (1973) and even <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Midsommar2019">MIDSOMMAR</A></B> 
    (2019), as all the residents of Brackenmore belong to a pagan cult 
    where they see everything in black and white terms, there are no gray 
    areas (such as Kate's marriage to Steven). It also has a 
    &quot;surprise&quot; reveal towards the end of the film that even a 
    blind man would see coming. It's obvious that this film, the feature 
    film directing debut of one Chris Kemble, had a troubled production 
    history, as J.P. Davidson is credited as &quot;Post Production 
    Director&quot;. Some plot points are left hanging, such as the 
    meaning of the strange symbol and people just enter the film and then 
    just as suddenly disappear, never to appear again. There are some 
    plusses to the film, such as the acting by Sophie Hopkins and the 
    striking cinematography by Justin MacCarthy and Rupert MacCarthy-Morrough,
     but it just isn't enough for me to give it a recommendation. It 
    moves way too slow to be entertaining. It's not a badly-made flick, 
    it just offers nothing we haven't seen before and done much better.;<A NAME="CarousHELL2016"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Several people have told me to take a look at <B><A HREF="caroushell_2016.htm">CAROUSHELL</A></B> 
    (2016) because they found it campy and full of nudity and bloody 
    gore. Well, I did watch it and I'm afraid I'm not of the same mind 
    about the film as they are. Sure it has plenty of female nudity, near 
    pornographic sex and extreme gore, but it's far too self-aware to 
    even be called campy. I wouldn't necessarily even call it funny, 
    although it does try to be different, but the lack of budget does it 
    no favors. As a matter of fact, I would even go as far as to say that 
    the film has no problem telling us that there was not enough money in 
    the budget to make a good film, so much so that director/co-screenwriter/co-star
     Steve Rudzinski (one of the main actors in <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#ScreamPark2012">SCREAM
     PARK</A></B> - 2012) goes as far as to focus on the things that 
    would have worked better with more money. And that is where the film 
    fails. The crazy storyline is this: A carousel (or 
    &quot;merry-go-round&quot; for those unfamiliar with the word) 
    unicorn named Duke (voiced by Steve Rimpici) gets sick and tired of 
    children abusing <A HREF="caroushell_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/caroushell dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>him,
     especially after a fat kid named &quot;Lunchbox&quot; (Teague Shaw) 
    begins kicking him and wiping his boogers on his head, so he breaks 
    free from his pole and starts killing everyone he meets, as he tracks 
    down Lunchbox, looking to murder him. Now here is where the film 
    fails in a big way.&nbsp; Duke is an inanimate object, with no moving 
    parts (his legs never move and his mouth doesn't, either, when he 
    talks); he just floats in the air (obviously helped by wires) and 
    kills everyone he runs into, starting with rodeo clown Jock-O (Andrew 
    Zibritosky), whom he stabs in the throat with his horn. The secondary 
    story finds Lunchbox's sister Laurie (S&eacute; Marie), an Internet 
    obsessed princess (she is always texting on her phone), being forced 
    to babysit her brother by their stripper mother (Judy H.R. Kirby), so 
    she takes him to an sparsely-attended house party, as Duke begins 
    killing the members of the party in various gory ways (stomping or 
    kicking them in the head with his hoofs; planting an axe in someone's 
    head; pulling out the intestines of a female partygoer), something an 
    inanimate object could never do. I guess we are supposed to suspend 
    belief as we watch this, but I guess I was in some kind of mood where 
    I just couldn't; it was just too ridiculous for me to accept, even as 
    a comedy. This is one time when I would have accepted some cheap CGI 
    to animate Duke, because it would be far more acceptable for me than 
    the way this film tries to pull it off (i.e. &quot;let's do 
    nothing&quot;). I get where this film gets good reviews from some 
    Internet film &quot;critics&quot;, but I demand a little more than 
    what this film delivers. The acting is awful, especially by Teague 
    Shaw as Lunchbox (and most of the partygoers). The only person to 
    register here is director Steve Rudzinski as Joe the Pizza Delivery 
    Guy, who drops off a load of pizza at the party and then spends a 
    good amount of the film looking for payment from anyone at the party, 
    only, just when he is about to get paid, Duke murders them and Joe 
    must try to collect from another partygoer; rinse and repeat. Even 
    that joke grows old quickly, because it goes on far too long to be 
    funny. There's also another subplot, where &quot;Cowboy Cool&quot;, a 
    man with a giant cowboy head on his shoulders (played by P.J. 
    Gaynard), hunts down Duke to kill him. That joke also grows old very 
    fast. There a scene where Duke fucks partygoer Sarah (Haley Madison) 
    in one of the house's bedrooms that crosses over into near-pornography
     territory, reminding me of a scene in <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Gutterballs">GUTTERBALLS</A></B> 
    (2008), another jokey gore film I didn't care for. You may have more 
    fun with this film than I did if you leave your brain at the door and 
    just go along for the ride, something I was unable to do. The film 
    runs less than 70 minutes, but it seemed twice as long to me. 
    Available streaming for free on YouTube and Tubi. I watched it on 
    Tubi, as YouTube has been showing far too many commercials inserted 
    willy-nilly during films and everything else on their site. Tubi does 
    show commercials, but they are short and very infrequent. Believe it 
    or not, you have to pay for this on Amazon Prime! A sequel is 
    currently being funded on crowdsourcing site Kickstarter (at the time 
    of this review).;<A NAME="Ravenswood2016"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I

    (2016) on Amazon Prime, it sounded like a found footage film with 
    some promise. Imagine my surprise to discover that it wasn't a found 
    footage film at all, just a regular horror movie. Calling it 
    &quot;regular&quot; is giving this film much too much credit, as it 
    is actually a cliche-ridden Australia horror flick that offers 
    nothing new to any serious horror fan. Ravenswood Psychiatriac 
    Hospital was one of Australia's most notorious (fictional) asylums, 
    known for giving patients electroshock treatments on a regular basis. 
    A flashback shows us a female patient named Sam (Celyren Phipps) 
    trying to escape the asylum on foot when two orderlies hit her with a 
    car (!) and drag her back to the asylum, where &quot;The Doctor&quot; 
    (Darren K. Hawkins) hooks her up to the electroshock device over a 
    nurse's protest. He tells her she doesn't understand how important it 
    is and then electrocutes Sam with the device. A short time later, The 
    Doctor commits suicide by electrocuting himself with the device and 
    Ravenswood Asylum is shut down for good. Back in the present, we see 
    a young couple about to make love in the abandoned asylum, when, 
    suddenly, their eyes shine a bright blue color and the film fades to 
    black with the sound of screams.. We then are introduced to four 
    Americans, Sofia (Madeline Marie Dona), her boyfriend Carl (Adam 
    Horner, who is one of the worst actors I have ever seen), Michael 
    (Shane Savage) and his<A HREF="ravenswood_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ravenswood 2017 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    girlfriend (and Carl's sister) Belle (Isabel Dickson), who arrive in 
    Australia on vacation. Right away, we see that even though Sofia and 
    Carl have been together for two years, they have never done the deed 
    together for reasons made clear later in the film (and it's the most 
    contrived excuse I have ever heard!). Sofia came to Australia for the 
    sole reason on taking a &quot;Ghost Tour&quot; of Ravenswood Asylum, 
    even though Carl thinks ghosts are a bunch of useless and phony crap. 
    When the foursome arrive at Ravenswood, they are greeted by tour 
    guides Zach (Jock Campbell, the only actor to give his character some 
    actual character) and Emma (Ashley Fitzgerald), who have secretly 
    tricked-out the entire asylum with false scares. Carl is a total dick 
    (even Zach callls him that), ruining the entire experience for 
    everyone with his constant put-downs and whining (you'll want to kick 
    him in the nuts). Things take a decidedly dark turn when Sofia meets 
    the female lover from earlier in the film, whom is possessed by the 
    spirit of Sam. She tells Sophia that she had to kill her boyfriend 
    because he was possessed by The Doctor (the possessed have shiny blue 
    eyes), who wanted to kill her and the spirit of Sam. Long story 
    short, Sophia is possessed by the spirit of Sam when Michael is 
    possessed by the spirit of The Doctor and he kills the other girl. 
    Everyone is then trapped in Ravenswood, as all the doors and windows 
    are locked. A reveal toward the end of the film changes things 
    drastically, as Sam is actually the evil spirit and we learn that The 
    Doctor didn't commit suicide, he was actually killed by the spirit of 
    Sam. Everything about this film is just plain ordinary, as 
    director/co-screenwriter (with Darren K. Hawkins) Jon Cohen offers 
    nothing in the way of scares or even a plausible plot. The majority 
    of the film has everyone running through the halls and rooms of 
    Ravenswood Asylum, either trying to escape the possessed Michael or 
    trying to get the spirit of Sam out of Sophia. It ends on a 
    fatalistic note, which is probably why this movie won awards at a few 
    film festivals you never heard of before. This film taxes your 
    patience, as it goes in no interesting directions until the final 
    shot and even that has been done to death hundreds of times before 
    and done hundreds of times better. I'm usually a huge fan of 
    Australian horror flicks, but this one didn't interest me at all, as 
    I was watching the clock rather than the screen the majority of the 
    time, waiting for it to finally end (I watch these films so you don't 
    have to!). Believe it or not, it would have played better as a found 
    footage flick and if you know me, you know I am not a fan of that 
    genre, so that is saying something. The total lack of blood, violence 
    or nudity also do it no favors. Skip it.:<A NAME="AllWrongFriends2016"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="all_the_wrong_friends_2016.htm">ALL THE WRONG FRIENDS</A></B> 
    (2016) held some promise, but the lazy writing by ten writers (!) do 
    the film in almost from the start. During the mid-1980's, loving 
    young couple Drew (Ricco Fajardo) and Nani (Krishna Smitha) are about 
    to drive to a music festival with Drew's troubled friend Adam (Tom 
    Gelo), but when they pick up Adam, they find out he invited three 
    friends to come with them, including the bossy and racist Logan (Sean 
    O'Connor), who makes an Ali Baba joke to Nani's face, who is 
    obviously Persian, Logan's girlfriend Alison (Brina Palencia), who is 
    a bitch with a capital &quot;C&quot;, and Simon (Dexter Hostetter), 
    who agrees and laughs at everything Logan says. This upsets Nani, who 
    doesn't like Logan one bit (and rightfully so) and wants to have some 
    alone time with Drew to work on their relationship, but Drew is able 
    to calm her down and she agrees to go with the flow. Almost 
    immediately, things take a wrong turn, for when Logan is driving 
    Drew's car to the music festival, he takes a detour to his friend 
    Mondo's (Nick Commella) house in the middle of nowhere and in the 
    middle of the woods. Logan says he has to pick up a package (drugs, 
    naturally) from Mondo, which he intends to sell at the music 
    festival. When they get to Mondo's house, Logan discovers that Mondo 
    is not there, so he bullies everyone in staying at <A HREF="all_the_wrong_friends_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/all the wrong friends amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>the
     house for the night and they will drive to the festival tomorrow 
    morning. Logan takes some of Mondo's cocaine stash, so he, Alison, 
    Simon and Adam snort huge amounts while Drew and Nani watch, refusing 
    to participate. Nani is really angry now and retires to one of the 
    bedrooms, where she discovers Mondo dead in one of the bathrooms, 
    apparently murdered and put in the bathtub. Drew wants to call the 
    police, but Logan breaks the phone by stomping on it (remember, this 
    is before everyone had cell phones) and tells everyone that he has a 
    better idea. He'll take Mondo's keys, open his safe, take the drugs 
    he was after and they will leave to go to the music festival. Nani 
    doesn't go along with it, so she and Drew go to leave in their car, 
    but it will not start (naturally). When Logan opens the safe and 
    discovers no drugs are in it, he convinces Adam, Alison and Simon to 
    stay until the drugs are found (he's convinced Mondo hid them 
    somewhere in the house). They really have no other choice to stay 
    since the car won't start and they can't call anyone to come pick 
    them up. Complications arise when a young couple, Brian (Andrew 
    Milbourn) and Erika (Boo Williamson), knock on the front door and ask 
    Logan for some help. It seems Erika fell on some rocks while they 
    were camping in the woods and has a huge gash in her leg that needs 
    immediate medical attention. They tell Logan they have been walking 
    for hours looking for some help and when they saw the house, it was a 
    blessing. But are they telling the truth? Long story short, someone 
    kills Logan by bashing his head in with a shovel and secrets are 
    revealed, such as Simon and Alison are lovers. Adam, who has been in 
    this house before, finds a hidden gun and shoots Brian in the 
    stomach, when it is revealed that he killed Mondo in a drug deal gone 
    wrong (Erika was injured during the scuffle). They tie Erika up, 
    while a dying Brian, who is a mechanic, tries to fix the car by 
    giving Drew instructions (Really?). Adam starts to lose his mind, all 
    sorts of tepid violence happens and we find out it was Simon who 
    killed Logan with Alison egging him on. No one in the film survives 
    the outcome. Where do I begin? Obviously, no one in their right mind 
    would ever agree to Logan's demanding attitude, barking out orders 
    like he was the cock of the walk and everyone immediately does his 
    bidding. All except Nani, that is, as she seems to be the only one 
    with a conscience, but Drew is able to talk her out of everything 
    with a simple kiss or a hug! It's not only unreal, it's insulting to 
    the viewing audience. Directors Ryan Hawkins and Mark Kerins, in 
    their first feature-length film, offer nothing for fans of horror 
    films, as the violence is rather subdued, there is minimal nudity and 
    the situations in the film&nbsp; are quite unbelievable, making me 
    throw up my hands several times, yelling out, &quot;C'mon now!&quot;. 
    No one ever acts this way, not even in the lowest budget horror film 
    and yet we are supposed to accept their actions and reactions. I 
    couldn't, which is why this film gets a big goose-egg from me. I've 
    seen better horror films in my dreams and they make more sense than 
    this film. It only runs 78 minutes, but it is a looooong 78 minutes.;<A NAME="CheckPoint2016"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;

    [2007 - 2017]) and many others, but the truth is this is a very weak 
    film, made weaker by some dodgy CGI during the action scenes. In the 
    small North Carolina coastal town of Port City, former Marine Roy 
    (Johnson) has turned vagrant and buddies up with fellow vagrant Grant 
    (Stephen Geoffreys; <B><A HREF="fright_night_1985.htm">FRIGHT NIGHT</A></B> 
    - 1985; in a role so restrained, you will not even recognize him!) 
    and they depend on the kindness of local cafe waitress Suzie 
    (Michelle Lee; <B><A HREF="supreme_champion_2010.htm">SUPREME CHAMPION</A></B> 
    - 2010) to supply them with her famous dumplings, even though her 
    husband, Kenny (comedian Ricky Harris; <B><A HREF="hard_rain_1998.htm">HARD
     RAIN</A></B> - 1998; who passed away shortly after the film finished 
    shooting. The film is dedicated to him.), a former Marine who served 
    in Roy's unit, wants Roy to straighten up and re-join society (Roy ditched<A HREF="check_point_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("145","213") --><IMG SRC="images/check point poster6a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    the normal life when his wife and his children were killed in a 
    sudden tornado that ripped through town, also killing his wife's 
    visiting parents). Also living in this sleepy little town and who 
    were members of Roy's Marine unit are: Sheriff Thomas Hancock 
    (Forsythe), the Sheriff's best friend Chester (Williamson) and T.J. 
    (Goldberg, who gained thirty pounds for the role), a 
    motorcycle-riding single father (he works as a U.P.S.-type delivery 
    driver), who is also trying to bring Roy back to his former self. The 
    TV and radio keeps announcing that members of the military are being 
    beheaded by an unknown terrorist group, for reasons still unclear, 
    and some former and still active military personnel are turning 
    traitor and joining this terrorist group. When Grant goes out on his 
    own in the middle of the night to forage the garbage bins for 
    something useful and edible, he hears the moans of people in a 
    building and looks through a hole in the building's wall, spying a 
    group of soldiers being beheaded by Suzie and the terrorist group 
    (whom film it), but Grant is captured and beheaded when he tries to 
    escape (He is wearing the dogtags that Roy gave him, so the 
    terrorists think he is a soldier, which makes no sense since Suzie 
    feeds him on a regular basis!). When Grant doesn't return to their 
    sleeping spot in the park, Roy goes out looking for him and discovers 
    the building where the soldiers and Grant were killed (he doesn't 
    know that yet, only seeing the terrorist symbol hanging on one of the 
    walls). He then sees a bunch of people watching a CNN-like report on 
    a TV which is showing the terrorists' newest video. He recognizes 
    Grant as one of the men being beheaded, but most of all he recognizes 
    the tattoo on one of the terrorists' hands as being that of Suzie 
    (and also recognizing the terrorist symbol). He tries to tell the 
    Sheriff that the murders are happening in town and Suzie is one of 
    the terrorists committing the atrocities, but the Sheriff doesn't 
    believe him, so Roy tries to attack Suzie in the cafe, screaming out 
    &quot;I know what you are doing!&quot;, but he is subdued and 
    arrested and put in the town's jail. He tells one of the Sheriff's 
    deputies, Parks (Niko Foster, who as &quot;Niko&quot; Executive 
    Produced this film), who promises he will check out the building and 
    search the area around it. When Deputy Parks searches the area, he 
    finds the dogtags of all the beheaded soldiers behind a trash bin and 
    goes back to the jail cell to free Roy, but Sheriff Hancock has his 
    other deputy, Stacks (Mane), shoot Deputy Parks point-blank in the 
    head, revealing that the Sheriff, Deputy Stacks and a group of other 
    citizens are the terrorist group. Roy escapes from his cell before 
    the Sheriff can kill him and joins forces with T.J., Kenny (who 
    shoots and kills Suzie when he discovers her treachery), Chester (who 
    had no idea his best friend was a homegrown terrorist) and T.J.'s 
    daughter's teacher Rebecca (Mindy Robinson), also a first class 
    soldier before turning teacher, to try and stop the terrorists. But 
    first they have to know why these terrorists are killing soldiers and 
    what their endgame is. And the reason for all this is more relevant 
    today than when the film was released. While Roy was locked in the 
    jail cell and saw Deputy Stacks murder Deputy Parks, the Sheriff told 
    Roy that he was going to take back the country from the President. 
    They were going to take command of a battleship that is being used as 
    a floating museum and steer it towards Washington D.C., while the 
    Sheriff and some men use the tunnel system under Chester's home (it 
    has been there since slavery days), which is said to lead directly to 
    the White House (WTF?!?), where they plan on murdering the President 
    and return the country back to the people. Pretty heady stuff, but 
    quite unlikely. Roy and his new unit first lay siege to the 
    battleship, where everyone has their own fight sequence (the best 
    part of the film, even though if you look closely, you will see some 
    tourists on the deck of the battleship as Roy and his unit enter the 
    ship!). They then enter Chester's property, where a huge battle 
    ensues (ruined by some very weak CGI bullet hits, blood and 
    explosions), where Kenny sacrifices his life by jumping on a live 
    grenade, Roy is shot several times (as well as taking a bazooka 
    blast!) and dies and Chester shoots Sheriff Hancock in the neck, 
    killing him. The terrorist plot defeated, T.J. and Rebecca take a 
    broken pole containing the American flag and restore it to its 
    upright position. The United States is now safe again. While I hoped 
    that this film would have been at least halfway decent, I was soon 
    disappointed as soon as I saw the terrible CGI gushots and spurting 
    blood, director/co-screenwriter (with A.J. Perez) Thomas J. Churchill 
    relying way too much on taking the cheap way out instead of offering 
    practical effects for more realism. And what about Kane Hodder, you 
    may ask? Well, he's given very little to do as terrorist Cyris, who 
    sends the sexy terrorist Libby (Krista Grotte; who has a pretty good 
    fight with Mindy Robinson during the finale) to seduce soldiers at 
    bars and murder them in hotel rooms. Hodder has less than two minutes 
    screen time, only to get shot in the head by Forsythe during the 
    Chester's property siege. Some people may find this film interesting 
    just for the eclectic cast alone (it also features Mel Novak [<B><A HREF="ultimate_warrior_1975.htm">THE
     ULTIMATE WARRIOR</A></B> - 1975] as a terrorist reverend of the 
    local church), but it's simple to see during the end credits that 
    nearly the entire cast was given a Producer or Associate Producer 
    credit, which means a little more extra cash in their pockets. The 
    plot is perfect for the Trump Presidency (and the January 6, 2021 
    siege of the Capital Building), which was just about to happen when 
    this film was being made, but the cheapness of the production may 
    ruin any enjoyment you may have, although wrestler Bill Goldberg has 
    a great mano-a-mano match with the equally muscled UFC fighter John 
    Lewis (<B><A HREF="blood_out_2011.htm">BLOOD OUT</A></B> - 2011) on 
    the deck of the battleship. Still, some people may find enjoyment 
    here, if they aren't as picky as I am when it comes to over-used 
    cheap CGI. I have no problem if CGI is used to good effect, but 
    that's not what this film does, it uses it every chance it gets to 
    avoid more expensive practical effects.</FONT></FONT></P>

    Such is the case with <B><A HREF="neverknock_2017.htm">NEVERKNOCK</A></B> 
    (2017; pardon the photos, as there is no advertising material...yet. 
    Problem solved (three years later!]). On Halloween in 1986, three 
    kids died while attempting to knock on the door of a haunted house on 
    59 Oakwood Lane. When a young policeman arrives, he finds the older 
    boy dead with &quot;NEVER NEVER KNOCK&quot; carved into his back. In 
    the film's most inventive sequence, we find out how legends are born 
    over 30 years through newscasts on TV. (You have to see it to 
    appreciate it.) Grace (Dominique Provost-Chalkley) and her younger 
    sister Jenna (Lola Flanery) agree to go out on a night of trick or 
    treating with fellow students Sydney (Eliana Jones), Amy (Kiana 
    Madeira), Ben (Jack Fulton) and Leah (Jodelle Ferland). To prove she 
    is scared of nothing, the younger Jenna climbs the chain link fence 
    (and cuts her hand) at 59 Oakwood Lane and knocks on the door. 
    Everyone is shocked to see the door absorb Jenna's blood and not soon 
    after a creature of some sort begins stalking the group, using their 
    worst fears against them after Jenna disappears. The creature 
    (thankfully, not a CGI creation, but a man [Troy James] in a suit) 
    attacks and kills Amy first. She has a severe scare of needles, so 
    the creature has needles come out of its hands and puncture her to 
    death. Ben has a severe fear of blood, so everyone he sees has blood 
    coming out of every orifice. Grace watched her mother burn alive in a 
    car fire and has a severe fear of it. The creature manages to kill 
    almost everyone except Grace and Leah, who are rescued by Officer 
    Rance (Nicholas Campbell; <A HREF="trapped_1981_blu-ray.htm"><B>TRAPPED</B></A> 
    - 1982). He tells the girls he was the young officer who found the 
    boy with the words carved on his back and for the past 30 years has 
    been doing research on the house. It seems it is not the house that 
    is the problem, but the house's front door, which was once the 
    entryway to a warehouse until a string of murders happened. The door 
    was transplanted to the house, where it remains till this day. Leah, 
    who has a fear of dogs, imagines she is being chased by a doberman 
    from her childhood. Officer Rance is killed by the creature and so is 
    Leah, but Grace finds sister Jenna inside 59 Oakwood Lane with her 
    hands nailed to the wall. The only way to defeat the creature is to 
    not be afraid and leave it to Jenna, the youngest of the group, to 
    defeat the creature by saying &quot;I'm not afraid of you any 
    more!&quot; and destroys the door. Director/screenwriter/executive 
    producer Sheldon Wilson (The sleeper <B><A HREF="shallow_ground_2004.htm">SHALLOW

    does provide some effective scenes, especially the sequence inside a

    up a probe that took samples from Mars<A HREF="life_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/life 2017 poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    and soon discover a single cell that shows life. Soon, the single 
    cell starts growing into an ever-growing intelligent octopus-like 
    translucent creature with flat tentacles that begins killing all the 
    scientists. In the film's most effective scene, the creature enters 
    the mouth of Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds, who gets top billing, but is 
    only in the movie about 40 minutes because he was filming <B><A HREF="hitmans_bodyguard_2017.htm">THE
     HITMAN'S BODYGUARD</A></B> at the same time.) after he tries to kill 
    it with a flame thrower and blood comes pouring out of his mouth in a 
    gravity-free environment (It really is creepy). The creature exits 
    Rory's dead body and starts to pick off the rest of the crew. This is 
    where the film's major problems occur. No matter what protocol is in 
    place, one of the scientists manages to breaks it, which would not 
    happen in real life. The creature can live both in space and in 
    oxygen, so one of the female Russian scientists, Ekaterina Golovkina 
    (Olga Dihovichnaya), puts on a space suit to try to capture it (This 
    is after they decide to kill it!) and the creature enters her 
    spacesuit and drains all the water out of her body and she drowns in 
    her own suit. The creature always finds a way to get into 
    impenetrable places and gets back into the space station and begins 
    killing off the scientists one-by-one. Soon, all that are left are 
    David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson) 
    and they decide to take off in separate escape pods in an attempt not 
    to bring the creature to Earth. David decides to to sacrifice himself 
    and take the escape pod into deep space, while Miranda takes her 
    escape pod to Earth. In a surprise twist everyone saw coming, the 
    creature enters David's pod and it enters Earth's atmosphere, while 
    Miranda's pod flies out to deep space (I told you this creature was 
    intelligent). The pod splashes down in Japanese waters and two 
    fishermen goes to the capsule. David pleads with them not to open the 
    pod, but they don't understand English and open it. What happens next 
    is left to our imagination. Besides some great creature CGI effects 
    and the scientists moving fast through the gravity-free station to 
    avoid the creature, the film is a total dud. It was released to 
    theaters, where it bombed and was quickly dumped on VOD, disc and 
    cable. Director Daniel Espinosa (<B><A HREF="safe_house_2012.htm">SAFE
     HOUSE</A></B> - 2012; also with Ryan Reynolds) tries his best to 
    make an effective Sci-Fi film , but he is let down by Rhett Reese 
    &amp; Paul Wernick's screenplay, where the scientists do the worst 
    possible things at the worst possible times (These scientists 
    wouldn't pass an Astronaut Training Camp). The creature sure is 
    impressive, though. Too bad the film stinks.;<A NAME="JeepersCreepers3-17"></A> Director/screenwriter/co-producer

    (2017) is so much worse than the first two films and I'll explain 
    why. First of all, it was announced to have a Spring 2017 release, 
    then a Summer release and then a VOD release. It ended up making its 
    premiere on the SyFy Network just before Halloween! Second of all, 
    the film spends way too much time on The <A HREF="jeepers_creepers_3_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/jeepers creepers 3 poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Creeper
     (Jonathan Breck, who played him in the first two films). So much 
    time, in fact, that The Creeper no longer seems scary. In the first 
    two films, The Creeper's screen time was minimal, which made his 
    appearance a lot more scary. And a lot of time is also spent on The 
    Creeper's truck (you know the one, a 1941 Chevrolet Heavy-Duty COE 
    [Cab Over Engine] whose license plate reads &quot;BEATNGU&quot; [Be 
    Eating You]) The truck is filled with many booby traps like a bone 
    spear shooting out of its tailpipe connected to a steel wire that 
    impales one teenager's leg. While there are a few effective scenes in 
    the film (like the slow motion sequence of Sheriff Tashtego [Stan 
    Shaw; <B><A HREF="monster_squad_1987.htm">THE MONSTER SQUAD</A></B> - 
    1987] firing a high power malfunctioning machine gun bolted to a 
    military vehicle and the bullets passing through the flying Creeper) 
    but the biggest surprise of all is how ugly they made Gaylen Brandon 
    (Meg Foster) look. She looks scarier than The Creeper itself and 
    talks to the ghost of her dead son Kenny (Jordan Sallou; Spike Lee's

    was killed by The Creeper, but not before cutting off The Creeper's 
    hand and burying it.). All Gaylen's daughter Addison (Gabrielle 
    Haugh) sees is her Mother talking to herself. Mom digs where Kenny 
    told her he buried The Creeper's hand but warns her not to do it. She 
    does it anyway and finds The Creeper's hand is still moving and the 
    Creeper is conscious of that fact. Whomever holds the hand is in for 
    a nasty experience. There is some bloody stuff, like The Creeper 
    throwing a carved bone spear (Like in <B><A HREF="jeepers_creepers_2.htm">JEEPERS
     CREEPERS 2</A></B> [2003]) just at the right time to impale two 
    teenagers to a tree. Unfortunately, hardly any of the film makes much 
    sense, (I guess the biggest explanation is for Sheriff Tashtego to 
    stop The Creeper from collecting enough bodies to eat [&quot;Every 23 
    years for 23 days it gets to eat&quot;; Salva must have a thing for 
    the number 23, because in his film <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#DarkHouse2014">DARK
     HOUSE</A></B> {2014}, that number plays an important part in the 
    hackneyed plot], but by the huge body count in this film [including 
    the Sheriff himself], he fails miserably)&nbsp; as the Creeper proves 
    he cannot be killed (we already knew that from the first film) and 
    Gina Philips returns from the first <B><A HREF="jeepers_creepers_2001.htm">JEEPERS
     CREEPERS</A></B> (2001) as Trish in what amounts to a thankless 
    cameo role in the finale, leaving room for yet another 
    sequel/prequel. Victor Salva (ugh, my stomach!) failed to learn to 
    keep the monster's appearance to a minimum amount of time, like he 
    did in 1 &amp; 2. Here, The Creeper has at least 80% of the screen 
    time and the films ends with Buddy Hooks (Chester Rushing; who has so 
    many freckles on his face and body, it looks like he has the 
    Measles!) boarding a school bus heading for a basketball championship 
    game. I guess Salva (I pooped my pants!) the screenwriter wanted it 
    to look like a prequel to <B>JC2</B>, but the story here doesnt jive 
    with that film. In this film, the Creeper has finished his 23 days. 
    but in <B>JC2</B>, the Creeper was very much active. If he was going 
    for such an inference, the story should have been much different and 
    it should have been called <B>JEEPERS CREEPERS 1.5</B>. That's 70% 
    too much screen time for the Creeper. With all the sex scandals going 
    on (at the time this review was written, Harvey Weinstein and Kevin 
    Spacey [who finally admitted he was gay!] were being blamed for 
    raping or sexually abusing over 50 women and boys), it wouldn't 
    surprise me if Hollywood was punishing Salva (barf bag not included) 
    for being a convicted pedophile by releasing this first to SyFy. If 
    this theory is true, it will be a long, long time before he directs 
    another film. So if you are one of those sick bastards who enjoys his 
    films (Child Protective Services must be present when he films kids 
    or teenagers) and even I have to admit he has made some good films (<B><A HREF="nature_of_the_beast_1995.htm">NATURE

    you would probably be right. When she was ten, Emma was sent to the 
    loony bin for killing her mother and younger sister. Emma has always 
    pleaded innocent,&nbsp; saying a creature was responsible for the 
    murders, for the only way to bring him to life is to say his name 
    (Just once instead of three), An adult Emma (Hayley Law) refuses to 
    tell anyone the killer's name (because it will bring him back to 
    life), but she has the poem that she keeps close to her person which 
    does mention The Stickman's name. Emma is sent to a Halfway house, 
    where a wiseass girl steals Emma poem and says The Stickman's name 
    out loud. Unable to convince anyone that this idiotic girl has 
    unleased the ultimate evil. The Stickman (a creature with movable 
    thin branches all over his body) begins to dispatch the girls and 
    orderlies at the Halfway House. This creature is able to make deadly 
    branches grow out of anything made of wood and even infects a girl 
    over the telephone, with branches growing out of her mouth. Jeremy 
    (Erik Knudsen), and old schoolmate of Emma's and fellow mental 
    patient confesses to Emma that he put the poem in Emma sister's 
    knapsack (he found it behind a brick in his basement wall) and it was 
    Emma sister who got Mom and sis dead. Emma makes Jeremy work with her 
    to destroy the thing, but how do they do it&nbsp;that is wood's 
    biggest enemy? Fire, of course, so Emma&nbsp; and Jeremy light him 
    up, until someone in the future mentions his name again. Now wasn't 
    that easy? Not like <B>THE HOLLOW</B> where the beast made of twigs 
    has fire in his mouth, but doesn't burn up. Sheldon Wilson seems to 
    be SyFy's go-to guy for original movies, but the only film he ever 
    made that I found interesting was 2004's <B><A HREF="shallow_ground_2004.htm">SHALLOW

    (2017) is a totally predictable crime thriller that we have seen 
    dozens of times before. Six people wake up tied to chairs in a locked 
    room around a table. A digital clock is above them and a disguised 
    voice on a loud speaker gives them two hours to decide which one is 
    going to live. After freeing themselves from their ropes and 
    introducing themselves to each other, Harry (Vincent Pastore), a 
    degenerate womanizer who found God is the first to be killed when he 
    rushes through the locked door after<A HREF="eyes_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/eyes 2017 poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="227" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    some masked men with masks and an Oriental woman enter the room with 
    coffee and donuts. Now the five prisoners must open up about their 
    lives. Victoria (Ana Isabelle) was a Miss Puerto Rico who has become 
    an adult film star; Arnold (Steven Hauck) is a college professor; 
    Robby (Greg Davis Jr.) was a normal man who got behind on the bills 
    and became a big-time losing gambler; Jeffrey (Danny Flaherty) is a 
    foul-mouthed twenty-something and Jaclyn (Megan West) is a lawyer; 
    but the voice on the intercom says they will have to do better than 
    that. They have all committed deadly crimes and he wants them to tell 
    the others in the group what they did. Victoria said that she killed 
    an adult film producer by running him over in a car, but she also 
    killed a baby in the process (which she purposely leaves out of the 
    conversation). Arnold says he murdered a college student Andy because 
    he was gay and had sex with Andy when he was 10 years old. Robby 
    murdered his wife and his wife's lover when he found them in bed 
    together. Arnold makes a run for the door when it is opened again and 
    is killed. The disguised voice turns out to be an FBI Agent named 
    Charlie (Nicholas Turturro) who wants everyone to tape their crimes 
    so there is no doubt that they are guilty. Jeffrey runs through the 
    door and is shot and Charlie yells out the door, &quot;I told you to 
    keep this door locked!&quot; Everyone admits to their crimes on 
    camera and then it is Jacyln's turn. Turns out she was once convicted 
    of murder in New Jersey, but was found not guilty. She thinks no 
    matter what she says will be double jeopardy, so she admits to 
    stealing a man's money from an offshore account and when he found out 
    she poisoned him and his wife in Delaware and dropped their car off a 
    cliff in New Jersey. Since we never saw anyone actually die, Charlie 
    brings out a very much alive Arnold, Robbie and Jeffrey and a female 
    FBI Agent arrests Jaclyn, saying double jeopardy doesn't apply since 
    the murders actually happened in Delaware, not New Jersey. All the 
    other people were actors hired by Charlie to play their roles. The 
    film closes with everyone celebrating with a shot overhead of the 
    camera (&quot;The Eyes&quot; of the title) watching them. I guessed 
    the ending of the film from the first death of Arnold. Everyone gets 
    killed when they walk or run through the door and we never see them 
    die. Director Robbie Bryan (<B><A HREF="imurders_2008.htm">iMURDERS</A></B> 
    - 2008) and screenwriter Robert T. Roe offer no suspense, just talk, 
    talk, talk, with absolutely no surprises. This actually reminds me of 
    a 2006 film called <B><A HREF="unknown_2006.htm">UNKNOWN</A></B>, 
    where 5 officers and detectives wake up in an inescapable warehouse 
    and must figure out why they are there. The first one to do so will 
    live. It is absolutely Hitchcockian when compared to this film, which 
    has the audacity to end with a quote from the Bible! I'll end this 
    review with my own quote from the Bible: If thine eyes offend thee, 
    pluck them out rather than watcheth this film (Sorry Jesus).; <B><A HREF="first_kill_2017.htm">FIRST
     KILL</A></B> (2017). Bruce Willis must like working with director

    - 2015; <B><A HREF="marauders_2016.htm">MARAUDERS</A></B> - 2016) 
    and, while I liked the two previous films, this one is not so good. 
    It was shot in 14 days and looks it. The story is rushed and the main 
    star (not Willis) is quite amateurish in his delivery. The story 
    centers on Danny (Ty Shelton), a young <A HREF="first_kill_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/first kill poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="153" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>boy
     who is always getting beat up in school by a bully. To toughen him 
    up, his investment banker father Will (Hayden Christensen) decides to 
    take him to the small town of Granville, Ohio (filmed on location), 
    where they go for a short while to stay with Aunt Dottie (Deb 
    Girdler). Dad decides to take Danny on his first deer-hunting trip. 
    First, he teaches Danny how to shoot a rifle (Sure, that will toughen 
    him up!) and then they go on the hunting trip. While in the woods, 
    Will and Danny spot two people in the distance, Charlie (Shea 
    Buckner) and Levi (Gethin Anthony). They are arguing over money that 
    Levi has from a big bank heist he has hidden from his partners. 
    Charlie shoots Levi in the chest and then hears Danny make a sound. 
    Charlie begins shooting in their direction, so Will has no other 
    choice but to fire back. Will kills Charlie, only to find out that he 
    was a cop. Levi is still alive, so Will puts him in the truck and 
    brings him back to the cabin, where wife Laura (Megan Leonard), who 
    is a nurse, patches him up on Will's orders. Quicker then you can say 
    &quot;instantly healed&quot;, Levi makes a miraculous recovery and 
    takes Danny as a hostage, telling Will that he will return Danny when 
    he retrieves the money that he has hidden (He threw a key befoire he 
    was shot, which both Will and Danny saw where it landed). Will 
    retrieves the key, while Danny finds out that Levi is not such a bad 
    man. Levi needed the money so his girlfriend's mother could have an 
    operation to remove an 85 lb. tumor in her stomach (They have no 
    healthcare insurance). Danny learns more from Levi on how to handle a 
    bully than Dad could ever teach, but retrieving the money may not be 
    as simple as imagined. Will has to deal with some crooked cops, 
    especially Police Chief Howell (Willis), who keeps a close watch on 
    Will and sets Levi up for a deadly fall. It all ends so predictably 
    that you will know the ending way in advance. The only thing good 
    here is Gethin Anthony (who played Charles Manson on the sadly 
    short-lived series <B><A HREF="aquarius_tv_series_2015.htm">AQUARIUS</A></B> 
    [2015 - 2016]). He gives Levi a layer of humanity not usually given 
    kidnappers in films. But Ty Shelton is simply terrible as Danny. 
    You'll wish that Danny doesn't make it through the film and Levi 
    lives. The story jumps from situation to situation without any 
    thought, a main problem with films shot on a tight schedule. 
    Especially Willis's character. He does things in the film that make 
    you doubt that he is crooked, but he proves to be in on the robbery 
    during the finale and his motives are rank (He thinks he deserves two 
    million dollars for serving his town as Chief for most of his adult 
    life! I wonder how the real-life Chief of Granville, Chief Bill 
    Caskey, thought of that turn in the story?). Willis is quickly 
    becoming a DTV staple. I'm still trying to figure out whether that is 
    a good or bad thing. One look at this film may give you the answer.; <B><A HREF="dont_sleep_2017.htm">DON'T
     SLEEP</A></B> (a.k.a. <A HREF="dont_sleep_2017.htm"><B>THE OTHER</B></A> 
    - 2017) starts out creepy enough, but then turns into a bunch of 
    supernatural mush. It starts out thirteen years ago, where a young 
    Zach (Dash Williams) has recurring nightmares about an old, blind, 
    nearly hairless, disfigured witch (Muriel Minot; who keeps saying 
    &quot;Don't be scared. There's nothing to be afraid of here.&quot; 
    Sure!) and masked deformed people (who could use some acne 
    treatments) trying to kill him. Young Zach refuses to go to sleep, so 
    his mother, Cindy (Jill Hennessy; <B><A HREF="law_order_tv_series.htm">LAW
     &amp; ORDER</A></B>), takes him to psychiatrist Dr. Richard Sommers 
    (Cary Elwes; <B><A HREF="saw_franchise_2004-2010.htm">SAW</A></B> - 
    2004) to see if he can cure Zach. Dr. Sommers tells Zach that this is 
    normal for kids to experience, so mom lies down in bed with Zach that 
    same night until he falls asleep. She gets up from his bed and he 
    instantly opens his eyes and says, &quot;You are going to die!!&quot;.
     The film then cuts to the present, where unmarried couple&nbsp; Zach 
    (Dominic Sherwood) and Shawn (Charlbi Dean Kriek) rent a house from 
    Jo (Drea de Matteo; <B><A HREF="sopranos_tv.htm">THE SOPRANOS</A></B> 
    - 1999-2006) and Vincent Marino (Alex Carter; <B><A HREF="csi_tv.htm">CSI:
     CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION</A></B> - 2003-2013) and Vincent's elderly 
    father (<A HREF="late breaking news.htm#AlexRocco">Alex Rocco</A> in 
    his final film). It's apparent that Zach is still suffering from 
    nightmarish visions (He is attacked by a hooded creep in his car and 
    sees strange monstrous figures on his laptop) and it doesn't help 
    that Jo thinks the house they are renting is haunted by spirits, 
    especially when Vincent's father goes looney when he sees a young 
    female ghost ghoul dining on his dog. Mr. Marino eventually hangs 
    himself by the neck with a chain in the garage telling the demons 
    &quot;Fuck you!!!&quot;&nbsp; Law student Zach becomes increasingly 
    unhinged as the days pass, so he goes to his mother (who is still 
    alive) and childhood friend Timmy (Andrew Caldwell). They both refuse 
    to talk<A HREF="dont_sleep_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/don't sleep 2017 poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="231" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    to him about what happened to him when he was a child (Timmy ends up 
    being dragged away to his death by the unknown forces). Zach's 
    nightmares and Jo's warnings to leave the house for good become too 
    much for Shawn, who tells Zach &quot;This is all becoming too bizarre 
    for me!&quot;. Zach goes back to Dr. Sommers to try and alieve his 
    nightmares (in the film's biggest flub, neither his mother or the 
    doctor have aged a day in thirteen years!), where we find out , that 
    as a kid, Zach was given electro-shock treatments to cure his 
    nightmares.&nbsp; It brings up the questions: What ever happened to 
    Zach's father? What happened to the Marinos (they disappear from the 
    film, never to return)? The main problem this film has is that it 
    keeps adding new stuff to the plot and never resolves any of it. 
    Director/producer/screenwriter Rick Bieber (one of the producers of <B><A HREF="flatliners_1990.htm">FLATLINERS</A></B> 
    - 1990 and <B><A HREF="stone_cold_1990.htm">STONE COLD</A></B> - 
    1991) offers no real frights, just useless jump scares that offer 
    nothing to advance the plot. How many times can we witness ugly, 
    deformed people jumping at us from nowhere before we say enough's 
    enough? Bieber throws in a kid from the school that Shawn teaches at 
    that acts the same way that Zach did when he was a child, another 
    young girl, Lilah (Sinclaire Schaefer) that is Shawn's friend, who is 
    the spitting image of the ghost ghoul that ate Mr. Marino's dog, 
    Zach's violent behavior when he makes love to Shawn and someone (or 
    something) that watches Shawn as she showers. None of these plot 
    points are ever resolved. What pissed me off most about this film is 
    when Dr. Sommers and his wife are attacked by the demons that Zach is 
    fighting. Dr. Sommers tells his wife that things will be alright and 
    they will be together forever. WHAT?@!? What the hell is that 
    supposed to mean? You'll give up when the film reveals that Shawn is 
    the reincarnated demonic soul of a woman that was searching for the 
    demonic soul that Zach possesses. It seems that ages ago, Zach once 
    save her life and gave his own and she has been searching for him 
    ever since that day. When you see Shawn complete with ugly sharp 
    teeth and demonic makeup, I dare you not to turn this film off. Too 
    bad that it is the final scene of the movie! All this film really is 
    is scene after scene of unanswered questions that never give answers. 
    If this is what modern horror has come to, count me out. <B>NOTE:</B> 
    Since the film has a production date of 2017 and Alex Rocco died in 
    2015 (The closing credits end with a tribute to him), it is easy to 
    come to the conclusion that this film had many production problems. 
    It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that once you watch the film.;<A NAME="CircusKane2017"></A> <B><A HREF="circus_kane_2017.htm">CIRCUS
     KANE</A></B> (2017) could have been a great addition to the Killer 
    Clown genre, but its overall cheapness ruins what good this film has, 
    mainly a terrific performance by Tim Abell as the titled clown, 
    Balthazar Kane, an '80s icon, whose tagline was &quot;Magic is 
    sacrifice&quot;. He supposedly died in a fire, but we know he didn't. 
    He invites a bunch of modern-day cliches (a gamer, a thief, a 
    musician, a movie memorabilia store owner, mysterious girl, etc.) to 
    his house, under the guise of winning half a million dollars each if 
    they survive till the next day. Each room contains a booby-trap that 
    they must survive to get to the next room (each room taking the life 
    of one of them) until only two are left. This film, directed by 
    Christopher Douglas Olen Ray (<B><A HREF="mercenaries_2014.htm">MERCENARIES</A></B> 
    - 2014), has some great ideas, but the meager budget cheapens the 
    overall effect of its lofty ambitions. Starring child actor Jonathan 
    Lipnicki (now an adult) and featuring a winning performance by Ted

    Ed&quot;, the movie memorabilia store owner, but as soon as he dies, 
    the film goes down the dumpster, only enlivened by Tim Abell (his 
    makeup is terrific) when he is on the screen, which is not often 
    enough. The &quot;surprise&quot; ending is anything but and the story 
    reminded me of several other better movies, like the <B><A HREF="saw_franchise_2004-2010.htm">SAW</A></B><A HREF="saw_franchise_2004-2010.htm"> franchise</A> 
    (there's an homage to those films here). While not terrible, it could

     film and for that reason alone, it fails because of its cheapness. 
    The story is about ex-sheriff Tom Mayfield (Boo Arnold), whose wife 
    disappeared two years ago (Tom thinks she left him) and his 
    brother-in-law, Ricky (Rawn Erickson), is a conspiracy theorist who 
    thinks he sees Bigfoot on his property. Strange things begin to 
    happen on Tom's ranch (he has over 200 acres in a small town in 
    Texas) and it's plain to see that it all has to do with Tom's 
    daughter, Hannah (Tahlia Morgan), who wants to become a writer, but 
    she keeps getting turned down by publishers. Ricky doesn't believe 
    his sister, Lillian (Tiffany Heath), left Tom at all. He believes she 
    was kidnapped by a bigfoot! The shit starts hitting the fan when Tom 
    discovers the bodies of three naked women on his property, all of 
    their internal organs missing. The idiotic detective on the case, 
    Detective Brendan Pitney (Kevin Sizemore), believes Tom is the 
    killer, and starts to realize he may be wrong (He hopes this case 
    will get him hired by the FBI). There is also cryptozoologist Rebecca 
    Otis (Stephanie Drapeau), who comes to Tom's property to investigate 
    the matter and tells Tom that Bigfoot is only interested in women 
    with O-Negative blood! It turns out the three dead women also had 
    O-Negative blood and Tom begins to believe when Detective Pitney 
    tells him that his wife's body was found a thousand miles away and 
    that she was with two other dead, naked women, all of their internal 
    organs missing. Yep, Lillian also had O-Negative blood. The rest of 
    the film details Tom trying to stop a Bigfoot from taking his 
    daughter. Yes, she also has O-Negative blood. Here's where the film 
    cheaps out. All we ever see of the Bigfoot are its arms, legs and 
    stomach breathing, we never see the full magilla. The film is also 
    atrociously acted by everyone involved. Director/screenwriter Dallas 
    Morgan (Nothing else interesting of note) offers nothing in the way 
    of entertainment to the viewing audience and Tom, who is supposed to 
    be the hero, acts in the worst ways possible when he finds out his 
    daughter is the next on Bigfoot's list of victims. It turns out that 
    Bigfoot is an alien who comes to Earth to kidnap women! It is never 
    explained why the creature needs women with O-Negative blood and the 
    nihilistic finale, where the aliens destroy all the evidence Tom and 
    security expert/bigfoot chapter member Akiro (Dante Basco) collected, 
    does the film no favors. Even if Dallas Morgan decided to give us a

    monsters? Then <B><A HREF="cold_ground_2017.htm">COLD GROUND</A></B> 
    (2017) is for you! This &quot;found footage&quot; film (Jesus, when 
    will people realize this genre died a long time ago?) purportedly 
    shows us a pair of French documentarians, who are also lovers, going 
    to the French Alps in 1976 to investigate a series of animal<A HREF="cold_ground_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/cold ground poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="162" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    mutilations and disappearances. Along for the trip are a detective 
    from Colorado (!), who is there to see if it is connected to the 
    &quot;Snoopy Case&quot; (Don't ask!) and a couple of guides, who are 
    going to the top of the mountain where the titled area is, an 
    unexplainable region where the ground is below zero, even in the 
    summer. As they make the three day trip up the mountain, they 
    experience an avalanche, find some human bones and remains and are 
    attacked by creatures we never get a good look at. The cameraman, 
    David (Geoffrey Blandin), breaks his ankle during the avalanche, but 
    continues filming as if nothing happened. When the group is thinned 
    out by the creatures until only David and Melissa (Gala Besson) are 
    left, they must find their way down the mountain before the creatures 
    kill them too, but they fail miserably. This film delivers nothing in 
    the way of entertainment, as it is nothing but 90 minutes of footage 
    of people walking in the snow and when the creatures attack, the 
    camera swirls so wildly, you never get a clear view of them. 
    Everything these people do are beyond comprehension and the camera 
    David uses is indestructible, surviving getting hit directly by an 
    avalanche and falling hundreds of feet down the mountain. We are 
    supposed to believe this footage was found forty years later, but you 
    wouldn't know it by the condition of the print (this is not supposed 
    to be video footage, but film!). Where did they find the camera, 
    encased in ice?!? Nothing is explained in this film, not what the 
    creatures are or where they came from, not why the area is a 
    &quot;cold ground&quot;, not why the creatures skin their victims 
    before killing them, not where the footage was found, nothing! And to 
    make matters worse, we never discover what happens to the last 
    victim, as the film just ends, explaining nothing. That is the 
    problem with these found footage flicks, they think that nothing 
    needs to be explained because it is supposedly &quot;real life&quot;, 
    but entertainment needs explanations, nothing near it is in this 
    film. Director/screenwriter (and I use that term loosely here) Fabien 
    Delage (the excellent pseudo-documentary <B><A HREF="#FuryOfTheDemon2015">FURY
     OF THE DEMON</A></B> - 2015) gives us nothing in the way of 
    entertainment, offering one unbelievable scene after the next (Why do 
    people keep on filming when their life is a stake???), even going as 
    far as to have Melissa cut David's broken foot off with what looks 
    like a butterknife and a sharp rock (!) and then, moments later, the 
    creatures kill him! Do yourself a favor and skip this one unless you 
    are a found footage freak (I am still wondering why people like these 
    kinds of films). I saw it for free streaming on Amazon Prime, but I 
    still felt like I was cheated. Christ, when will I ever learn?;<A NAME="RedEye2017"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     All the time I was watching <B><A HREF="red_eye_2017.htm">RED EYE</A></B> 
    (2017), all I could think of is how poorly written this film was, 
    like it was penned by high school students as their idea how a horror 
    film should be. Imagine my surprise to find out that 
    director/producer Tristan Clay and co-star/producer Destinie Orndoff 
    wrote this screenplay together as 17-year-old seniors in high school 
    and the next year, shortly after they graduated, financed this film 
    on crowdfunding site Indiegogo, raising the ten thousand dollars 
    needed to shoot this somewhat bloody, but very amateurish slasher 
    film. This is, indeed, a stereotypical no-budget slasher flick that 
    drops logic like we would drop a bowel movement and it stinks just as 
    bad. School chums Gage Barker (Scott King), Ryann O'Riley (Heather 
    Dorff), Jake Lockhart (Hayden Wilberger) and his girlfriend Rykyr 
    Jacobs (Destinie Orndoff) travel deep in the woods to shoot a 
    documentary on the urban legend of &quot;Red Eye&quot;, a serial 
    killer who murders those who dare to trespass or camp out on his 
    land, cannibalizing and raping the bodies of his victims (usually in 
    that order). On their drive there, they meet a woman on the side of 
    the road whose car won't start. The woman, Bea (Jessica Cameron; the 
    only real actor in this film, appearing in such horror flicks as <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#MrHush2011">MR.
     HUSH</A></B> - 2011; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Sleeper2011">THE SLEEPER</A></B>

    - 2019), thanks the young adults for stopping and fixing her car, 
    telling them that there's no cell phone towers in this vicinity and 
    it's a road not traveled by many <A HREF="red_eye_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/red eye 2017 amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>people,
     but she lives a mile down the road if they run into any trouble. Bea 
    also tells them that her brother once saw Red Eye and he hasn't been 
    the same since; she has been taking care of him ever since that 
    fateful day. The foursome then drive into the woods and hike by foot 
    for what seems like most of the day until they get to Red Eye's 
    territory. It should also be mentioned that Gage has been obsessed 
    with Red Eye for years and the only thing he wants to do is make his 
    documentary. It also seems that Jake cheated on Rykyr (what a stupid 
    fucking spelling of the name!) with Ryann and she is now two months 
    pregnant. The only reason she came on this trip was to tell Jake she 
    is pregnant and is keeping the baby. What happens next is right out 
    of Slasher Films 101, as Red Eye appears and kills Ryann just as she 
    tells Jake she is pregnant. Red Eye rips open her stomach (my, how 
    fitting!) with a meat hook, pulls out her intestines and then 
    masturbates by rubbing the bloody intestines all over his penis 
    (Thankfully not shown and only implied, as we see his body jerking 
    while we hear the intestines squishing!). Red Eye then decapitates 
    Jake (who is a total jerk throughout his time in the film, so no one 
    should be sorry to see him die) and then goes after Rykyr, just as we 
    learn that Gage is working in conjunction with Red Eye to shoot his 
    &quot;perfect&quot; horror film. Red Eye then cuts into Rykyr's arms 
    with a knife and then slashes her throat, while Gage films her death 
    (Gage then rapes Rykyr's corpse doggy style!). Gage then kills Red 
    Eye because witnesses are not allowed (A flashback shows us that Gage 
    hired Bea's brother [Clayton Abbott] to portray Red Eye and Bea's 
    appearance on the road was all a set-up staged by Gage). Gage then 
    kills Bea (who has no idea that her brother and the other three are 
    dead) by shoving a tree branch in her mouth and down her throat, 
    because, you know, no witnesses. The film ends with Gage telling us 
    that the film we just watched was the film he shot (try not to think 
    too much about that, because your head will explode)! Hoo, boy, what 
    a stinker. There are so many lapses in logic, it would make a 
    hillbilly with an IQ of ten say, &quot;Wait a minute, this makes no 
    sense!&quot; One scene shows Ryann getting her leg caught in a bear 
    trap and Rykyr running to the car to go get help. After seeing the 
    quartet walk the entire morning away from their car, it only takes 
    Rykyr a couple of minutes to get to it! She and Gage then walk to 
    Bea's house, which also takes them a couple of minutes, even though 
    they drove a long way from the house to get to their destination! The 
    acting is uniformly bad from everyone except Jessica Cameron, who 
    gives this film much more class than it deserves. I could go on and 
    on about how awful this film is (even at 73 minutes, it seems much 
    too long, especially the closing credits, which runs a good ten 
    minutes listing all the people who contributed to the crowdfunding), 
    but just by writing this short review, it takes me back to the 
    suffering that this film inflicted on me (Rykyr is portrayed as an 
    outcast in high school because she likes horror films! Really, in 
    this day and age?). Even though the film is bloody, none of the 
    effects stand out and the writing is typical teenager stuff, or at 
    least the way teenagers thinks the world operates (Rykyr sleeps 
    around, looking for love in all the wrong places, because her father, 
    who is now in prison on manslaughter charges, raped her constantly 
    when she was younger and her mother loves daddy more than her!). Not 
    worth wasting your time on, especially if you are a slasher film 
    fanatic. It's free to watch on Tubi and YouTube (both with 
    commercials), but you will have to pay to watch it on Amazon Prime.

     HOUSE ON THE HILL</A></B> (2017) is a simply abysmal supernatural 
    flick that makes no sense almost from the get-go. It is full of 
    unbelievable characters that grate on your nerves (besides, no people 
    ever acted this way...ever. They only act this way to advance the 
    film's slow-moving plot) and cliched situations, so take my word for 
    it, avoid this <A HREF="first_house_on_the_hill_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/first house on the hill amazon poster4b small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>piece
     of shit-cake at all costs. The plot (if you want to call it that) 
    concerns an uber-religious girl named Valerie (Christine Scherer), 
    who is about the spend the weekend at the titled rented house. She 
    goes to her priest, Father Matthew (Lou Volpe, who passed away before 
    this film was released), to tell him this will be her first time in a 
    coed environment, so he tells her to have some fun and gives her a 
    religious artifact to wear around her neck to protect her from 
    &quot;evil&quot; (Just because she will be spending a weekend with 
    another girl and two guys? C'mon now!). When they get to the house, 
    mysterious owner Madame Windsor (Helene Udy; <B><A HREF="my_bloody_valentine_1981.htm">MY
     BLOODY VALENTINE</A></B> - 1981; the best thing about this film, but 
    only because she is the only professional actor in this stinking pile 
    of dog droppings), makes all of them sign a contract without reading 
    it (I know this is a film, but don't you think someone, anyone, would 
    want to read it before putting their signature on it? These four 
    don't!). As expected, supernatural events begin to happen, such as a 
    strange force field that surrounds the house and makes it impossible 
    to escape. The quartet start playing with tarot cards (I mean, why 
    not? While you are at it, play with an Ouija board, too!) and begin 
    dying in non-bloody ways. But wait! Turns out they are not dead, they 
    were only pretending. Turns out Valerie is the long-lost daughter of 
    Madame Windsor and she needs to sacrifice Valerie to unleash all of 
    Satan's demons on Earth. (Pardon...What???). As you can see, this 
    film doesn't make a lick of sense and I should have known when I saw 
    all the unknown film festivals this film played in that were 
    mentioned on the poster (Never a good sign! What the fuck is the 
    &quot;Ferrera Film Festival&quot;? The &quot;Wayward Festival&quot;?).
     It turns out director/co-screenwriter Matteo Saradini left his 
    native Italy to come and live in Los Angeles so he could make films. 
    If this is the kind of film he will continue to churn-out, maybe he 
    should go back to Italy. One more thing: &quot;actor&quot; Umberto 
    Celisano, who portrays quartet member Samuel is probably the worst 
    actor I have ever laid my eyes upon. I wanted to reach into my screen 
    and rip his throat out, not because of the character he plays, but 
    because of his acting ability, which is non-existent. I caught this 
    for free streaming on Amazon Prime and I almost discontinued my 
    membership because of it, but if I did, I would be acting no better 
    than Umberto Celisano! This film should be used as a torture device 
    for terrorists. It's probably the worst thing you can do to them.;<A NAME="WishUpon2017"></A> <B><A HREF="wish_upon_2017.htm">WISH
     UPON</A></B> (2017) is one of those PG-13-rated supernatural horror 
    films that promises bloody horror, but, in the end, shows you nothing 
    but cheap jump scares. I was hoping for a little bit more when I 
    found an &quot;Unrated Director's Cut&quot; streaming on Amazon 
    Prime, but even this version would find a hard time getting an 
    R-Rating, as there is very little blood and absolutely no horror to 
    be found. When Clare Shannon was a little girl, she witnessed her 
    mother commit suicide by hanging her self in the attic, after 
    throwing something in the trash that was wrapped in a cloth. Twelve 
    years pass, and a teenage Clare (a good Joey King; <B><A HREF="white_house_down_2013.htm">WHITE
     HOUSE DOWN</A></B> - 2013) still lives in the same house with her 
    father Jonathan (Ryan Phillippe; <B><A HREF="catch_hell_2014.htm">CATCH
     HELL</A></B> - 2014), who collects trash for a living (He's not a 
    garbageman, but a person who looks for trash that may be valuable, 
    being a major embarrassment to Clare). Clare's life in high school is 
    not much better, as she is constantly shamed by a clique of girls 
    (and a token gay man) who think she is beneath them, posting photos 
    of her father collecting trash on social media (We all know people 
    like this, or at least I do!). One day, Jonathan finds a unique box 
    in the trash with Chinese writing on it and brings it home as an 
    early birthday present for Clare. She actually likes it but she can't 
    understand most of the words written on the box (She is taking a 
    Chinese language class in school), except for the words &quot;Seven 
    Wishes&quot;. Just for a joke, she wishes that the girl in school that<A HREF="wish_upon_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/wish upon amazon poster4b small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    bothers her most would &quot;rot&quot; and, sure enough, when the 
    girl wakes up in the morning, her body is beginning to rot, as she 
    has caught a flesh-eating disease! What Clare doesn't realize is that 
    every wish she makes means the death of someone she knows (the box 
    opens on its own and begins playing music). In this case it's her dog 
    Rex, the dog her mother gave her (Rex refuses to come in her bedroom 
    when she brings the box there, even though he has slept there every 
    night), as she finds him under the porch being devoured by rats.. 
    Clare hasn't put 2 + 2 together yet and continues to make wishes, 
    which causes the deaths of her nice neighbor across the street, Mrs. 
    Deluca (Sherilyn Fenn; <B><A HREF="twin_peaks_tv_series.htm">TWIN PEAKS</A></B> 
    [1990-1991], whose ponytail gets stuck in the garbage disposal until 
    it snaps her neck (!), and her rich Uncle August (Victor Sutton), who 
    slips in his bathtub, knocks himself out (twice!) and drowns. It's 
    only when Clare asks her friend Ryan (Ki Hong Lee) to take the box to 
    his cousin Gina (Alice Lee) to translate all the writing on it that 
    she discovers that she has a cursed &quot;Chinese Wishing Music 
    Box&quot; (akin to the Chinese Wishing Pot) and just what it does to 
    the person who owns it. It seems that the only way to pass the box to 
    someone else is to die (which is why Clare's mother hanged herself). 
    When Gina learns even more about the box, she dies in an extremely 
    painful manner (Even though we don't see it!), when she trips and 
    impales her head on a horned Chinese dragon statue in her apartment 
    (This is the best sequence in the film , as it plays with the viewer, 
    since Jonathan [who is changing a flat tire on a dark and twisty 
    road] or Gina could be the victim here). So, can Clare find a way to 
    destroy the box and bring her life back to &quot;normal&quot; or is 
    she cursed like her mother? At first, everything goes swimmingly for 
    Clare, as her pauper existence turns around and she becomes rich 
    (after wishing Uncle August's will would name her as the sole 
    beneficiary of his wealth and mansion!), but just like any film that 
    uses &quot;The Monkey's Paw&quot; as a primer (and there have been 
    plenty), it turns out that all the best-intentioned wishes will bite 
    you in the ass. Do not expect any happy endings here. The best way to 
    describe this film, directed by John R. Leonetti (<B><A HREF="annabelle_2014.htm">ANNABELLE</A></B> 
    - 2014; <B><A HREF="wolves_at_the_door_2015.htm">WOLVES AT THE DOOR</A></B> 
    - 2015), is ordinary PG-13-rated crap, as the camera always turns 
    away rather than facing the horror. This film is nothing but a 
    collection of unsurprising jump scares, especially Clare's fate, 
    which anyone with a brain could see coming a mile away. Even the 
    Unrated Director's Cut shows us close to nothing, except for 
    extending the deaths for a few frames, but still showing us very 
    little. This is nothing but a major disappointment which I urge you 
    to stay away from, unless you have to see every PG-13 horror film out 
    there. In that case, all I have is pity for you.;<A NAME="DieIn1Day2017"></A> 
    After watching director Roberto D'Antona's excellent <B><A HREF="#RoadToHell2018">ROAD
     TO HELL</A></B> (2018), I decided to watch a film called <B><A HREF="die_in_one_day_2017.htm">DIE
     IN ONE DAY</A></B> (2017), which was directed by Roberto's older 
    brother Eros D'Antona (<B><A HREF="#Haunted2016">HAUNTED</A></B> - 
    2016). I don't know if Eros was having a bad day, but this film is 
    nothing but a cheap knock-off of Rob Zombie's <B><A HREF="#T31-2016">31</A></B> 
    (2016), a film I admire, but this film has none of Zombie's verve or 
    excitement, because, let's face it, no one can do Rob Zombie except 
    Rob Zombie. The film begins with a masked figure meeting another 
    masked figure in a remote location. One of the masked <A HREF="die_in_one_day_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/die in one day italy poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>figures
     hands the other a bag and they then drive away in opposite 
    directions. The bag contains an envelope full of cash (Euros) and a 
    hard drive that contains information on a selection of people. The 
    masked figure then sends messages to a variety of rich, wealthy 
    types, telling them that &quot;New Auditions Are Available&quot; and 
    they all look very excited. We then switch to Richard (Co-Executive 
    Producer David White; <B><A HREF="zombie_massacre_2_reich_of_the_dead_2015.htm">ZOMBIE
     MASSACRE 2: REICH OF THE DEAD</A></B> - 2015), a British man who is 
    riding his bike in Rome. We see him get off his bike at a dirty 
    trailer park, where he meets his daughter Mindy (Lisa Marie 
    Picciolo), whom he hasn't seen in eight years when his slut of an 
    ex-wife, Paige (Cinzia Susino), absconded with her and left no 
    forwarding address. Father and daughter bond easily, but when Paige 
    shows up with her biker boyfriend Vinnie (Mirko D'Antona; another 
    brother that has appeared in nearly every D'Antona film by both 
    brothers), she tells Richard to beat it, even when he shows her some 
    letter saying that Child Services are going to take Mindy away from 
    her because she treats her daughter like a slave. Paige crumples the 
    letter, throws it to the ground and has Vinnie strong-arm Richard to 
    get him to leave, Paige telling Richard that he will never get 
    custody of Mindy. It will happen over her dead body. Richard then 
    goes to a bar to drown his sorrows in booze. A pretty lady named 
    Sasha (Kateryna Korchynska; Roberto D'Antona's <B><A HREF="wicked_gift_2017.htm">THE
     WICKED GIFT</A></B> - 2017) enters the bar and walks directly to 
    Richard. They begin to talk and it is rather obvious that Sasha has 
    ulterior motives in mind, but what are they? When Richard starts 
    talking about his daughter and his predicament, Sasha asks why he 
    doesn't hire a good lawyer to get custody of Mindy. Richard says he 
    is broke and doesn't have the kind of money to hire a good lawyer. 
    Sasha then tells him that she can have him enter a contest to win 
    25,000 Euros. She is taking part in an experimental improvised 
    theatrical play in and locked-down theater and the &quot;actor&quot; 
    who gives the best performance wins the jackpot.&nbsp; Richard thinks 
    it is too good to be true but agrees to join her, so the next morning 
    they arrive at the theater and a masked man (the same man who handed 
    the bag to the other masked man in the beginning of the film) sees 
    Richard and contacts the head of the &quot;game&quot;. The head of 
    the game, called &quot;The Director&quot; (voiced by Roberto 
    D'Antona) sends out messages to his wealthy clients, asking them if 
    they would like Richard to join their little &quot;game&quot;. It is 
    a resounding yes and when Richard and Sasha enter the theater (they 
    must first have to give up their cell phones before entering the 
    theater), they meet the two other participants in the game, Debbie 
    (Daniela Ladisi) and Kurt (Dario Grassi). A masked man then enters 
    the stage and points a gun at Debbie's head, pulls the trigger and we 
    hear a loud bang. Instead of Debbie being dead, we then see it's a 
    water pistol and The Director comes over the loudspeaker to announce 
    the rules of the game, called &quot;Die In One Day&quot;. The rules 
    are rather simple. The contestants will be hunted down and killed by 
    various masked &quot;Hunters&quot;, but anyone who survives in the 
    inescapable theater for 24 hours will win the prize, which is now 
    100,000 Euros. The theater is equipped with many cameras, so there is 
    no use in trying to hide, but the Hunters cannot simply kill their 
    prey, &quot;It must be done with style&quot;, so paying customers on 
    the Internet watching the game are entertained. When a masked Hunter 
    comes out with a sword, Kurt thinks it is nothing but a prank like 
    the water pistol, only for the Hunter to slice his neck open (one of 
    the goriest effects in the film). The Director comes over the 
    loudspeaker to reprimand the Hunter, reminding him that the killings 
    must be done with panache, Kurt's killing lacks the flair the viewers 
    are demanding. Richard, Sasha and Debbie run for their lives, but 
    Debbie is caught rather quickly and is run-through with a sword<A HREF="die_in_one_day_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/die in one day poster6a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    (after she kills a Hunter with a box-cutter, slicing his neck open). 
    Now only Richard and Sasha are left and this is the film's major 
    fault. There aren't enough contestants to make this film interesting, 
    especially since we think that Sasha is a knowing participant in the 
    game. Spoilers ahead: It turns out that Sasha is not a knowing member 
    of the game, she is actually Mindy's sister! It turns out that Paige 
    was once married to a Russian guy before she married Richard and she 
    got pregnant with Sasha. She entered the game to win the money to 
    take Mindy away from Paige. Long story short, Richard gets killed in 
    the game (he gets shot in the side with a speargun bolt and then has 
    his head caved-in with a crowbar by a Hunter who turns out to be 
    Vinnie) and Sasha wins the money, but what Sasha doesn't know is that 
    Paige is also part of the game and The Director is actually a police 
    detective who covers up the killings. When Sasha walks away with the 
    money, there is a stinger during the closing credits that shows The 
    Director setting up Part 2 of the game, telling Paige that Sasha will 
    definitely be part of it. I guess this is because there is to be a 
    sequel? Even though this film runs a scant 78 minutes, it still seems 
    twice as long than it actually is. The killings are nothing to write 
    home about (Richard kills one Hunter by crushing his head in with an 
    old computer CRT monitor and Sasha kills another Hunter by ramming a 
    metal hook into his neck, ripping out his throat and planting an axe 
    in his head) and the film just slogs along until the uneventful 
    conclusion. Since Eros D'Antona is an award-winning director and 
    writer (for <B><A HREF="#Insane2015">INSANE</A></B> - 2015), starring 
    Roberto D'Antona in the lead role), I was expecting a lot more than 
    what I got. This is a sparsely-occupied film that contains 
    uninteresting characters, pat situations and no surprises (except for 
    the unbelievable reveal that Sasha is Mindy's sister!). It's films 
    like this that give Italian modern-day horror a bad name. Skip it.;<A NAME="NightWatchman2017"></A> <B><A HREF="night_watchman_2017.htm">THE
     NIGHT WATCHMAN</A></B> (2017) is another cheap Italian horror film 
    with very little to recommend and a lot to complain about. Former cop 
    Jack (Jonathan Silvestri) is on his first night as night watchman at 
    a music school. He begins hearing noises and voices, but every time 
    he goes to investigate nothing is there. He also keeps getting phone 
    calls from a woman named Emma, who tells Jack that she is about to be 
    killed by &quot;him&quot;. Every time Jack tries to get information 
    from her, like where she is and what's her last name, he only gets a 
    tiny tidbit before the phone goes dead. What Jack can't see, we do, 
    such as a woman called &quot;HalfFace&quot; (Andreea Dragusanu) in 
    the <A HREF="night_watchman_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/night watchman 2017 poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>credits,
     a ghostly monster whose top half of her face is a mutated and 
    deformed mess (All she does is scream). Jack keeps phoning his new 
    boss (not a good thing to do on the first night on the job) and tells 
    him about the phone calls he keeps getting from Emma, but his boss 
    tells him he shouldn't be getting any phone calls at all since the 
    phone is transferred to an answering service every night at closing 
    time. Just who is Emma and why is she contacting Jack? When Jack 
    finally gets Emma's last name, he phones his boss, who tells Jack he 
    has a friend in the police force and he will give him Emma's 
    information, but not to call him back again tonight; he will call him 
    when his friend come up with any info on Emma. Of course, Jack 
    doesn't listen, as the noises keep getting louder and louder, pianos 
    start playing by themselves and one room stinks of death, so he calls 
    up his boss again, who tells him that his friend in the police 
    department just phoned him to say Emma was murdered in the building 
    that is now the music school, his boss saying he had no idea this 
    ever happened. The film ends with Jack, Emma (Vanessa Grappa), a 
    ghost woman named Nancy (Elena Vettori) and his boss lying dead on 
    the floor, pieces of paper on all the bodies where their names are 
    handwritten in block letters. WTF?!? There is so much wrong here, I 
    don't know where to begin. The fault lies firmly on one person's 
    shoulders, as director/producer/writer/cinematographer/editor/costume 
    designer/nose wiper/hall monitor Tiziano Cella has no idea how to 
    make a movie. It looks like it was shot on an iPhone and the story is 
    all over the place, but the worse thing about it is that midway 
    through this film, everything stops so that Jack can watch a short 
    film on his tablet! Obviously inserted to pad out the film's scant 
    66-minute running time, it has no other reason for being here than 
    for Tiziano Cella to whore out an 11-minute short he made in 2011 
    called <B><A HREF="imago_vocis_2011.htm">IMAGO VOCIS</A></B> 
    (&quot;Echo&quot;), about two deaf couples who stay at an evil bed 
    &amp; breakfast. It has nothing to do with the film proper and is as 
    boring as fuck. It is also obvious that English was a third language 
    for most of the &quot;actors&quot; here, as it is hard to understand 
    them, especially when there are no English subtitles. The slow-moving 
    end credits run a very long ten minutes and show bloopers during the 
    making of this film, none of them funny at all. Let me end this 
    review by saying this: If you are ever to see Tiziano Cella's name in 
    the credits of a movie you are about to watch, burn it immediately 
    and run away in the opposite direction. Believe me, it will save you 
    from suffering a lifetime of boredom. This is a hundred pounds of 
    shit in a five pound bag.;<A NAME="Cannibal Farm2017"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="escape_from_cannibal_farm_2017.htm">ESCAPE FROM CANNIBAL FARM</A></B> 
    (2017) opens up with this little nursery rhyme: <B>Don't venture near 
    old Hansen Farm...Where blazing fire brought them harm...For those 
    who travel past this place...Beware The Boy With The Melted Face...</B> 
    Charming, right? The film then shows us two young brothers who stuff 
    a younger boy named Sammy Hansen into<A HREF="escape_from_cannibal_farm_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/cannibal farm 2017 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    a burlap sack and go to a river to smoke cigarettes. One of the boys 
    accidently (?) throws a lit cigarette on the sack, setting it on 
    fire. They throw the sack into the river, but it's too shallow to put 
    the fire out. Sammy's mother, Bethany (Charlotte Roest-Ellis), and 
    father, Hunt Hansen (Barrington De La Roche), pull the sack out of 
    the river, open it and pull a still-alive Sammy out of it, but his 
    face is horribly burned. So begins the legend of &quot;The Boy With 
    The Melted Face.&quot; Bethany can't take the pain and anguish of her 
    son's horrible face, so she runs into the woods, douses herself with 
    ethanol alcohol and sets herself on fire in front of her husband, who 
    arrives too late to save her. Hunt keeps the skeleton of Bethany in 
    his attic, adorned in a dress and sitting on a chair (!), which her 
    deformed son Sammy visits frequently. We then watch the Harver family 
    jump into an RV and head to the Hansen Farm property for a camping 
    vacation. The family includes overbearing mother Jessica (Kate Marie 
    Davies), her new husband Wesley Wallace (Toby Wynn-Davies), her 
    daughter Katherine (Rowena Bentley) and her fianc&eacute; Kurt 
    Daniels (Joe Street), smart-assed older brother Toby (David Lenik) 
    and young pre-teen brother Sam (Dylan Curtis). To say this family is 
    dysfunctional is a vast understatement, as every one of them has 
    serious issues (it would take far too long to list them, so take my 
    word for it). On their way to the farm, Jessica makes Wesley stop the 
    RV and ask a man sitting by the roadside for directions, even though 
    Wesley says he isn't lost. That man would be Hunt Hansen, who has 
    long hair and looks like the Uncle no one talks about over 
    Thanksgiving dinner (they don't get much creepier looking than him!). 
    Hunt tries to sell them his brand of apple cider and lemonade, but 
    the Harver family declines and drives on (You would have to be insane 
    to even try to drink it!). Once they reach the Hansen Farm property, 
    Jessica and Wesley rough it outside in a tent while everyone else 
    sleeps in the RV. Sam sees a face in the window, but no one believes 
    him. Suddenly, everyone hears Jessica screaming and when they run 
    outside, they see Jessica and Wesley's tent is on fire (Wesley is 
    enjoying an expensive cigar and is not in the tent). Kurt and Toby 
    pull Jessica out of the tent, but her arms are horribly burned. They 
    go to drive to the nearest hospital, but the RV won't start, so they 
    leave Jessica nd Sam in the RV and everyone else walks to the 
    farmhouse to use the phone (If I told you why no one thought to bring 
    a cell phone with them, you wouldn't believe me!). As soon as they 
    arrive at the Hansen barn, they are met by a shotgun-toting Hunt and 
    a fully-grown Sammy Hansen (Jack Miller), who is carrying a chainsaw. 
    Hunt pulls the trigger and shoots a load of buckshot into Wesley's 
    chest, wounding him, while everyone else scatters to avoid the 
    shotgun blasts and chainsaw dismemberment. When Hunt runs out of 
    shells, he picks up a pitchfork and gores Toby in the ass as he tries 
    to climb to safety. When Hunt knocks out Katherine with the butt of 
    his shotgun (Katherine says, &quot;Please don't shoot me!&quot; Hunt 
    replies, &quot;Pity, girl, you'll wish that I did!&quot; just before 
    knocking her out cold), she wakes up and discovers the entire Harver 
    family, including Jessica and Sam, are in their own separate wire 
    cages, like some wild animals waiting to be slaughtered. Sammy Hanson 
    tries to brand the other Sam with a red-hot giant &quot;H&quot;, but 
    he is stopped by Hunt, who tells Sammy to untie everyone, while he 
    tells the the true story of Hansen farm. A flashback shows us that 
    Hunt got vengeance on the two brothers' family who burned Sammy by 
    entering their home, blowing off their father's foot with the shotgun 
    and shooting the mother point blank, killing her. One of the boys 
    tries to run away, but Hunt stops him with a shotgun blast full of 
    buckshot. He locks the family in the same cages the Harver family are 
    now occupying and he even went as far as to burn the escaping boy's 
    face, turning him into an exact duplicate of Sammy. Hunt then feeds 
    the flesh of the family to two cannibals who live in a cave; they 
    were also former victims of Hunt, both of whom he nearly starved to 
    death, Hunt turning them into cannibals by only feeding them human 
    flesh. Back in the present, Hunt warns everyone to not try to escape 
    from the cages because they are electrified. Kurt has a problem being 
    locked in a cage, so he tries to bust his way out, using his hands to 
    push the cage open, only to lose both his hands when the electricity 
    makes them explode! Kurt never even gets the chance to learn an 
    alternate way to hitch-hike, as Sammy appears and kills him with a 
    sledgehammer. I'm not going to bother to explain the methods of how 
    everyone else dies, because this film offers nothing new in the 
    torture porn genre. It's just a gory kill, rinse and repeat, ad 
    nauseum. I will tell you this: Wesley brought a &quot;clean white <A HREF="escape_from_cannibal_farm_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/cannibal farm 2017 amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>middle
     class family&quot; to Hansen's Farm to be slaughtered for their meat 
    for a rich class of cannibals that will pay Wesley handsomely for it, 
    but never trust a cannibal. Does this surprise you? I didn't think 
    so. This British horror film is nothing but pure torture porn (I hate 
    using that term, but it fits here) with a minimum of plot and lots of 
    gory kills. Director/Producer/Screenwriter/Editor Charlie Steeds (<B><A HREF="winterskin_2018.htm">WINTERSKIN</A></B> 
    - 2018; <B><A HREF="barge_people_2018.htm">THE BARGE PEOPLE</A></B> - 
    2018) manages to evoke some tension in a couple of scenes, one scene 
    in particular, when Toby is about to be turned into cannibal chow 
    (Sammy cuts the top of Toby's forehead with a handsaw), only him to 
    to turn the tables by freeing his hands, running Sammy through the 
    neck with a shish-kebob skewer and then hacking him to death with a 
    pickaxe. Toby then hides in a furnace, but Hunt turns it on and as 
    Toby cries out in pain, mother Jessica, still trapped in her cage, 
    sings a hymn while watching son Toby burn to death. It's the closest 
    thing to a &quot;soul&quot; this film has. There's also a character 
    named Reverend Hawksworthe (Jackson Wright), who represents the 
    unseen rich cannibal clientel. He gets his own flashback explaining 
    how he came to be that way. But this film is far too long at 
    102-minutes to hold your attention. Another thing that bothered me to 
    no end was that all the shotgun blasts sound like a low-level click, 
    like the film couldn't afford to use ADR to dub in the proper sound. 
    It's not only annoying, it takes you completely out of the film since 
    shotguns are never that silent when being discharged. The final 
    sequence is also especially maddening, but I'll leave that for you to 
    discover should you decide to watch this bloody film (I know who you 
    are!). This film tries to be something you have never seen before, 
    but its tone of hopelessness is sure to be a turn-off to any serious 
    horror fan. At least it was for me. The title was shortened to <B><A HREF="escape_from_cannibal_farm_2017.htm#CannibalFarm">CANNIBAL
     FARM</A></B> for its U.S. VOD and disc release. Available streaming 
    on Amazon Prime at the time of this review.;<A NAME="Devil2.0-2017"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="devil_2.0_2017.htm">DEVIL 2.0</A></B> (2017) is a film 
    best viewed while tripping on LSD or some other hallucinogenic, as it 
    will only make sense under those conditions. This film, which started 
    shooting in 2010 and finished in 2017 (proving to me that many 
    illegal drugs were ingested), tells the tale of Bobby Angel 
    (director/executive producer/screenwriter/star/steroid abuser Stace 
    Williamson), who, as a nine-year-old boy in 1975, saw his parents and 
    sister killed by a vampire named Toyfa (also portrayed by 
    Williamson), but he was saved from the same fate by his &quot;Space 
    Father&quot;, a blue-skinned alien. In the present time, Bobby is 
    wanted by the police for a crime he did not commit, so he becomes an 
    outlaw, who declares his innocence on the Internet via a &quot;video 
    diary&quot;. What comes out of Bobby's mouth during these 
    YouTube-like confessionals is pure metaphysical crap. In other words, 
    he couldn't look more guiltier. Bobby tells us that Toyfa is coming 
    for him and if he wins, it means the end of all human life on our 
    planet. You see, according to Bobby, vampires are aliens from another 
    galaxy (!) who steal people's souls as they suck out your blood. If 
    they get Bobby's soul,&nbsp; there would be no hope for our<A HREF="devil_2.0_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/devil 2.0 poster6a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    planet. As Toyfa draws nearer to Bobby, he acts like he is possessed, 
    only for his Space Father to return to tell him that he is not human 
    at all, he is an alien. Bobby has to learn how to &quot;beat a 
    bullet&quot;, so his Space Father begins shooting him in the forehead 
    (Bobby screaming, &quot;Son of a BITCH!&quot;) until he learns to 
    move faster than a speeding bullet. Did I mention that Bobby could 
    also &quot;dimension jump&quot;? As the film draws nearer to the 
    finale, Bobby's wife, Pam (Dorothy Dalba), and daughter Kayla 
    (Cassandra Ebner) fall victim to Toyfa, as Bobby prepares for the 
    battle of his life. Does Bobby win? Fuck if I know, I wasn't on drugs 
    when watching it! The shit that comes out of Bobby's mouth can be 
    best described as the mystical words that come out of some New Age 
    guru's blowhole (Williamson makes so many funny faces during his 
    confessionals, it will have you rolling on the floor, not with 
    laughter, but with uncontrollable seizures!). The film is one big 
    clusterfuck, as the photography is solarized so that nothing is its 
    natural color and the music is akin to scratching your nails over a 
    blackboard. I kept trying to turn this film off, but something inside 
    me made me watch it entirely. I only hope that &quot;something&quot; 
    never comes to me again! There is not one thing about this film that 
    I can recommend, as the acting is awful, the photography and music 
    headache-inducing and the dialogue is nothing but words fit for a 
    psychoanalist talking to a crazy person (and vice versa). And get 
    this: When the end of the final credits roll, it points us to the 
    website of Mr. Williamson, who is just as loony as his Bobby Angel 
    character. He tells us that he is visited by aliens all the time and 
    they have been on our planet just as long as we have. He offers no 
    proof of this, telling us that we must take him for his word. Really? 
    Why should I believe him? Conspiracy theorists are a dime a dozen. 
    This film is hardly worth anyone's time, yet some people may enjoy it 
    for its trippiness factor. I'm sure that jack-of-all-trades Stace 
    Williamson was trying to convey the duality of character since he 
    plays both the hero and the villain in this flick, but he does it in 
    such a heavy-handed and far-out way, he fails with everyone except 
    the drug crowd. After watching the entire film, you will finally 
    realize that drugs are bad. Those looking for female nudity are going 
    to be disappointed (just lots of shots of women in bikinis), as are 
    those looking for lots of gore (just Toyfa biting people on the 
    neck). Ugh, does anyone have any Rolaids?;<A NAME="HousesOctobr2-2017"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     I had no intention of ever watching <B><A HREF="houses_october_built_2_2017.htm">THE
     HOUSES OCTOBER BUILT 2</A></B> (2017), since I found the <A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm#HousesOctober2014">original
     film</A> such a chore to get through, but readers of this site were 
    relentless, telling me that it was better than the first film and I 
    have to watch it. Well, I relented and did watch it, but, just like 
    the first one, this is also a found footage flick and while it is 
    slightly better than its predecessor, it still wasn't good enough for 
    me to give it a passing grade. In the first film, it ended with all 
    five friends being buried alive by a haunt group called &quot;The 
    Blue Skeleton&quot;. This film takes up with what happened next. The 
    Blue Skeleton released all four male friends, Zack 
    (producer/co-screenwriter Zack Andrews), Mikey (Mikey Roe), Bobby 
    (director/co-screenwriter Bobby Roe) and Jeff (Jeff Larson) and had 
    to free female member Brandy (Brandy Schaefer) from the trunk of a 
    car when the police came too close to capturing them, dumping Brandy 
    in the middle of nowhere. All this happened on Halloween Night in 
    2013. A year passes and the four male members and Brandy become 
    YouTube celebrities, Brandy (who is known as &quot;Coffin Girl&quot; 
    on the Internet) wanting nothing to do with Halloween haunted houses 
    ever again (she even dyes her hair blonde to try and forget what 
    happened to her). The four guys start getting paid good money by 
    going to Haunts and rating them, but they will make a load more money 
    if Brandy will join them, so Zack guilts her into coming to five 
    Halloween Haunts in five days, saying she will get the lion's share 
    of the money they will get paid (Truth is, the four guys need the 
    money, but they are about to get fired if Brandy doesn't <A HREF="houses_october_built_2_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/houses october built 2 poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>join
     them). As you can probably guess, members of The Blue Skeleton, 
    including Porcelain Doll (Jayme Wakefield), begin to follow the five 
    member group around, as they tour five real-life Haunts around the 
    country in their updated RV. Zack keeps hearing about the ultimate 
    Haunt called &quot;Hellbent&quot;, where real scares, not 
    manufactured ones, are said to happen. Brandy wants nothing to do 
    with it, but one night, while all of them are sleeping in their RV, 
    members of The Blue Skeleton pump knockout gas into the RV and then 
    drive it to the site where Hellbent is located. When they wake up and 
    discover that they have been driven to Hellbent, instead of being 
    upset or worried, the four guys want to know what happens next, but 
    Brandy wants nothing to do with it, but no one has any choice to 
    leave, as everyone is forced into Hellbent to suffer their fates (A 
    major clue to this film is a sign the group passes in town that reads 
    &quot;Seek Out Hellbent&quot;, which is an anagram for...? [I'll let 
    you do the solving]). Now I'm going to spoil the ending for you, so 
    if you rather not know, stop reading now. It turns out that the four 
    guys are working in cahoots with The Blue Skeleton to snap Brandy out 
    of the funk she has been in for the last year, but The Blue Skeleton 
    is not to be trusted, as Porcelain Doll whispers something into 
    Brandy's ear and she is able to turn the tables on her four 
    soon-to-be-ex-friends. As they drive out of town, we see someone 
    rearranging the letters on the sign, forming the three words...? 
    While slightly better in the shaky-cam and darkness departments over 
    the first film, the truth is that this is basically a retread of the 
    first film, with slightly different results, so if you have already 
    seen the first one, there is no reason to see the second one. The 
    only real good things about these two films are the tours we get 
    through the real Haunts that are scattered throughout the United 
    States. The second film gives us a better, better lit view of the 
    insides of these haunted houses and we meet the real people who run 
    them, but it just isn't enough for me to recommend either film. There 
    is some nudity in this one (&quot;laser tits!&quot;) and the violence 
    is ramped up a bit, but no one dies in this film or the first one, 
    even though we are led to believe the four guys die in this one, but 
    it's nothing but fake special effects (Face being set on fire; hacked 
    to death by a chainsaw; being force-fed buckets of blood; death by 
    hanging) to get Brandy to loosen up and become her old self again. It 
    just doesn't make any sense to do this to a friend who has been 
    traumatized, but we also don't feel anything for Brandy because she 
    agrees to go to Hellbent for more money! I have had it with this 
    franchise and if any more are to be made (there is talk that a Part 3 
    will be coming sometime soon), I will not be watching it, no matter 
    how much my readers plead for me to do so. Found footage is not a 
    genre I love (although there have been some great ones, like <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Bay2012">THE

    tales that take place in a small suburban town on the eve of

    its face because the stories fail to ignite any horror. This film

    the ire of a male neighbor who use to be champion of Halloween 
    decorations on the block. The neighbor, along with another couple,

    deadly secret. She's actually a serial killer (the reason why she 
    moves from town-to-town) and begins hunting down the trio one-by one. 
    Well, I guess she is going to have to move again. #2). A lesbian 
    couple, along with their straight friends, illegally enter a corn 
    field to celebrate Halloween, not knowing the corn field's owner is 
    actually a witch. The witch brings an overweight scarecrow to life 
    and it begins hunting down the trespassers one-by-one, until only the 
    lesbians are left. They then find out the secret of the witch and the 
    scarecrow dates back centuries, where an entire town, including women 
    and children, were slaughtered by the witch, who was cursed and has 
    to kill a certain amount of people every year to satisfy Satan. Why 
    make the two women lesbians? Does that make them more deserving of 
    death? #3). A mysterious young woman can only see the love of her 
    life for a few minutes every three months. While we are led to 
    believe that this woman is part of the witness protection program and 
    her lover is her handler, we then learn that the woman is some kind 
    of demon who kills people who enter her house by pulling their spinal 
    columns out of their bodies and chowing down on their flesh. She is 
    forced to move from town-to-town to avoid a secret black ops 
    operation out to capture her. Well, I guess she is going have to 
    relocate again! That's the whole film in a nutshell, folks, and it's 
    not very well acted or written, as Director/Screenwriter/Executive 
    Producer/Cinematographer Christopher M. Carter fails to give any of 
    the tales any kind of satisfying kick, unlike the anthology film it 
    tries to imitate. Quite frankly, <B><A HREF="trick_r_treat_2007.htm">TRICK
     'R TREAT</A></B>, had a cast of great actors, which this film does 
    not, and it suffers greatly because of it. Also, the three tales end 
    rather abruptly and don't tie together so nicely, unlike the 
    previously mentioned movie. Yes, they all take place in the same town 
    at the same time, but that's as far as the three tales tie themselves 
    together. They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but 
    in this instance it is anything but. The stories aren't so special, 
    the acting is horrendous (Especially by the woman who plays the 
    witch. I was cringing as she was explaining her story to one of the 
    lesbians.) and while there is some blood and gore, none of it is 
    memorable in the least. I saw this for free on Amazon Prime, so you 
    didn't have to. Heed my warning! Especially if you are lesbians! 
    (Hey, just kidding!).;<A NAME="Follower2017"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp; Man, is 
    the found footage genre ever going to end or does every new director 
    feel the need to make their first feature-length &quot;film&quot; a 
    found footage flick? Case in point: <B><A HREF="follower_2017.htm">THE
     FOLLOWER</A></B> (2017) is a horrid found footage horror film about 
    a YouTube paranormal channel (titled &quot;Creepy Passion&quot;) host 
    named David Baker (Nicolas Shake) being invited by lonely woman Carol 
    Anderson (Chlo&eacute; Dumas) to investigate her creepy mansion 
    because she thinks it is haunted, as there have been quite a few 
    unexplained events happening in the house. When David arrives at the 
    house and meets Carol, she has only one rule she wishes not to be 
    broken: Not to go to her late grandmother's bedroom upstairs. When 
    grandma died years ago, she made Carol promise to keep her bedroom 
    door locked and not to allow anyone to enter it. It seems Carol also 
    has a split personality. At <A HREF="follower_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("142","213") --><IMG SRC="images/follower 2017 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>times
     she can be lovely and charming, but the next moment she can become 
    extremely angry and yell at David for not doing things the way she 
    want them to be done. So what does David do? Of course, he breaks 
    into Grandma's bedroom and allows something to escape, something 
    deadly and unforgiving. When Carol discovers David's treachery, she 
    becomes very violent and nearly kills him, but the next moment she 
    tells David she has fallen in love with him by watching his Creepy 
    Passion channel and the only reason she invited him into her home was 
    to begin a relationship with him. Unfortunately, David doesn't feel 
    the same way and tells Carol that he wants to keep everything 
    strictly professional, which disappoints Carol tremendously. Carol 
    tells David that her grandmother was extremely cruel when she was 
    alive and nearly killed her a couple of times. The paranormal 
    activity begins to happen more frequently, nearly killing David, 
    scaring him so much that he escapes the house and vows never to 
    return there (David is somewhat a non-believer [he's cheerful to a 
    fault] in the paranormal, but his experiences in the house has made 
    him a believer). When David goes back to his home, the film travels 
    four weeks ahead, where paranormal events begin happening there, so 
    much so that David believes the evil has followed him home (hence the 
    title). He tries phoning Carol, but when he discovers that her phone 
    number is no longer in service, he decides to do some investigating 
    into Carol's family, discovering she has a brother named Jerry (Peter 
    Lamarque), who police believed killed his grandmother (it seems her 
    body was never found) and was put in an insane asylum, but he has 
    been released a short time ago. David decides to go back to Carol's 
    house to see if she's okay, but when he knocks on the door, a man 
    answers and tells David he must be mistaken, no one named Carol has 
    ever lived here, he must be thinking of another house, as there are 
    plenty like it in the woods nearby. David is no fool and knows that 
    the man is Jerry, so he films Jerry leaving the house and entering a 
    shed. When Jerry exits the shed, David discovers Carol's and 
    Grandma's dessicated corpses inside, but before he can do anything, 
    Jerry appears and a fight ensues. Just when it looks like David is 
    about to be killed, the Follower intervenes and kills Jerry. Yes, the 
    Follower was the grandmother or Carol (it is never made clear), but 
    is it over? First off, this film was made for $23,000 in twelve days 
    and it looks it, as the &quot;film&quot; is nothing but handheld 
    digital video camera shots and, yes, there are plenty of &quot;shakey 
    cam&quot; shots to contribute to the headache you will have when 
    watching this. First-time feature director/writer/executive producer/producer/editor/digital
     effects artist K&eacute;vin Mendiboure, who has also made a handful 
    of short films, shows us nothing new or at least different than any 
    other found footage flick. It has the earmarks of amateurism, as 
    Nicolas Shake as David fails to register in his role. There is a 
    direct shift in the tone of the movie during the halfway mark, as 
    David is a happy, smiley person in the beginning, but once he returns 
    home things get deadly serious and Shake is unable to handle it. The 
    only decent acting in this cast-of-three-people is Chlo&eacute; Dumas 
    as Carol, but the film goes downhill once she is no longer on-screen. 
    This French Canadian flick (filmed in English) offers nothing for the 
    audience to remember, as the paranormal events amount to nothing but 
    chairs and other objects moving by themselves, shadows in the corner 
    of David's eyes and all the things we see on all those fake 
    paranormal channels on YouTube. In other words, don't waste your time 
    unless you have to watch every found footage flick ever made. And, 
    yes, people like that do exist!;<A NAME="Ghastlies2017"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    for a non-treat that seems to last for an eternity even though it 
    only runs 75 minutes. To call this a semi-pro effort is doing a giant 
    disservice to all the kids out there who want to make their first 
    movie. If they watch this slice of excrement to get an idea of what 
    it takes to make a film, most of them would give up on all their

    who walks around like she is in a coma) to a cabin in the woods 
    where, five years earlier, a trio of fuzzy stuffed aliens landed in 
    their unstabilized spaceship (Once you see it, you'll know what I 
    mean, but I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy!) and interrupted a 
    satanic ritual, where the aliens get locked in an underground bunker. 
    Wouldn't you know it, the bunker gets unlocked and the aliens escape. 
    They begin eating the sorority sisters and their boyfriends in the 
    most unprofessional ways possible, making the viewers cringe at what 
    they see on the screen. Not cringe in fear and disgust, but cringe in 
    embarrassment. That's basically the entire film, but there are two 
    bicycle cops (What are bicycle cops doing in the forest?) who play 
    MadLibs while fixing one of the bike's tires and a couple of 
    neighbors that have been feeding the aliens vagrants or anyone else 
    who dares enter their property. I could tell you how awful these 
    aliens look (just look at the image page), as they are nothing but 
    handmade stuffed creatures with no working parts except for their 
    mouths, allowing puppeteers to shove their hands up the aliens' asses 
    to make them look like they are tearing people apart. What we see in 
    the gore department is body parts falling to the ground and blood 
    spraying on walls and trees. Every &quot;actor&quot; in this film is 
    abysmal, not knowing how to emote in even the most basic of 
    situations. To mention any of their names would be a slap-in-the-face 
    to the profession of acting. This film is so threadbare, I imagine it 
    was funded by the change Brett Kelly found behind the cushions of his 
    couch. Yes it's that bad, probably worse than mere words can convey. 
    It also has a non-ending where the neighbors lock Sloane in the 
    bunker while a fleet of unstable spaceships land on Earth, unleashing 
    a slew of stuffed aliens on the planet (at least we don't have to see 
    that part, as the change from behind the couch cushions probably ran 
    out). Just before the film is about to show the end credits, a bit of 
    crappy animation appears, showing the aliens trying to kill a dog! 
    Just like the &quot;real&quot; aliens, none of their appendages move 
    except their mouths. It's like a sub-par version of <B><A HREF="south_park_movie.htm">SOUTH
     PARK</A></B>. Do yourself a favor and avoid this flick like the 
    plague (it's not even good for the occasional unintentional laugh), 
    but if you are a masochist at heart, it can be found streaming for 
    free on YouTube and Tubi. I mean, I have to watch shit like this so 
    you don't have to. Excuse me, I have to rinse my brain out with 
    kerosene, to wipe this film from my memory. Just thinking about it 
    makes me want to shit my pants.</FONT></FONT></P>

     HAUNTING OF THE SUICIDE HOUSE</B></A> (2018) For years I have been 
    talking about the benefits of being an Amazon Prime member, but now 
    it is time I tell you about one of the deficits, especially for me. 
    If it's one thing I hate more than &quot;Found Footage&quot; films, 
    it is the so-called &quot;Real-Life Paranormal Investigation&quot; 
    flicks, which use both found footage and herky-jerky camera footage. 
    Don't get me wrong, I love real paranormal footage (I'm a huge fan of &quot;<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBnbnH7DGXT9yBBVFbZeIwQ">Nuke's
     Top 5</A>&quot; on YouTube), but when you spend an hour or more 
    looking at footage that shows you nothing and they try to tell you 
    something is there, that is where I draw the line.&nbsp; The above 
    film is one of the worst of the lot, but <A HREF="paranormal_investigation_films_on_amazon_prime.htm">Amazon
     Prime is literally brimming with these cheap paranormal 
    investigation-type films</A>, made with a budget that can be found 
    jingling in my front pants pocket. This film deals with the exploits 
    of two Internet &quot;Stars&quot;, paranormal investigators <A HREF="haunting_of_the_suicide_house_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/haunting of the suicide house amazon poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Summer
     (Nichele Lambert) and Kai (Sariel Toribio), who, along with new 
    cameraman Steven (Jesse Ramos), go to investigate the &quot;Suicide 
    House&quot;, a one level ranch style house built in the 1970s (which 
    Summer calls &quot;ancient&quot; and a &quot;hella long time 
    ago&quot;!) where everyone who lived there were either murdered or 
    committed suicide. Right off the bat, we can see that this greedy and 
    selfish team are not about the paranormal investigation, but are only 
    interested in getting a high number of viewers, so they falsify most 
    of the so-called ghost activity (Kai slouches down out of camera view 
    and flips some pots and pans, making it look like ghosts did it), as 
    they no longer want to do this kind of stuff and want to graduate to 
    the &quot;big time&quot; (Even Steven is in on it). Good luck with 
    that, asswipes. When real ghost activity begins to happen, they just 
    go along with it, thinking that the other person is responsible and 
    not telling them (or making stupid assumptions; Ass = u + me). When 
    Kai begins acting strangely and wants to leave, they talk him into 
    staying for their &quot;big finale&quot;. They should have left, as 
    Steven is attacked by a spirit and wants to leave, but they talk him 
    into staying one more night. I would have flipped them the bird as I 
    walked out the door because Kai becomes possessed and kills Steven 
    with an axe, before he breaks Summer's arm and then stabs himself 
    with a large knife rather than killing Summer, killing himself. Oh 
    well, another suicide for the house. Ho-hum. To say that this 
    63-minute film is a bore is a vast understatement. It seems ten times 
    longer than it actually is, thanks to abhorrent acting, no special 
    effects whatsoever (all we get is a door closing by itself and 
    kitchen cupboards opening by their lonesome [you can see the strings 
    pulling the cabinet door open!]) and we never see Kai slaughtering 
    Steven. We know how everything is going to turn out because in the 
    beginning of the film, we see Summer sitting in a detective's office, 
    her arm in a sling, while the detectives view the footage Steven shot 
    from the past two days (Summer even says that both Kai and Steven are 
    dead!). Even the ending, where Summer and mental former resident Alex 
    (Lauren Searl) return to the Suicide House, pour gasoline over it and 
    strike a match, bottoms out. We don't see the house on fire, we just 
    hear it burning! So where's the surprise? The sad fact is that there 
    isn't any. No blood, no graphic violence and no nudity, so why even 
    bother? It took three directors to make this video garbage and they 
    made another piece of crap called <B><A HREF="haunting_of_the_whitlow_house_2018.htm">THE
     HAUNTING OF THE WHITLOW HOUSE</A></B> (2018), which I do not intend 
    to watch (It's also on Prime, if you like to beat yourself over the 
    head repeatedly with a blunt object, go for it!). My stool is more 
    interesting than this. So there is the only deficit I can think of 
    about being a Prime member. Seriously, I can't think of another 
    reason why you shouldn't be a member! Just stay away from this piece 
    of flotsam or you'll end up as jetsam.;<A NAME="Exposure2018"></A> <B><A HREF="exposure_2018.htm">EXPOSURE</A></B> 
    (2018) is basically a two-character film where a married couple, Myra 
    (Carmen Anello) and James (Owen Lawless), drive to his grandparent's 
    mountain home to repair their troubled marriage. Almost from the 
    beginning, we can see why this marriage is troubled. Myra keeps 
    getting text messages by her (former?) lover and James use to 
    physically abuse his wife. Something bad also happened to James' 
    grandparents, something he refuses to talk about, even getting 
    verbally abusive with Myra when she asks about it. That's the problem 
    with this entire film. It rests on the shoulders of this married 
    couple, only they are so despicable, we don't care what happens to 
    them. They also do stupid things at the worst time possible. When 
    James finally<A HREF="exposure_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/exposure poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    tells his wife what happened to his grandparents, we ask ourselves 
    why he brought her there in the first place. Flashbacks show us that 
    his grandfather (Bruce Smith) disappeared in the woods surrounding 
    the home and when he was found, he was never the same. He then killed 
    his grandmother (Lynn Lowry; <A HREF="horror d - i.htm#I Drink Your Blood"><B>I
     DRINK YOUR BLOOD</B></A> - 1971) and then disappeared in the forest 
    again, never to be found. When James and Myra begin repairing their 
    marriage by going fishing (!), James hooks what he thinks is a piece 
    of driftwood, only it is some unknown creature that bites him on the 
    hand. Then the same thing that happened to his grandfather begins to 
    happen to him. That's basically the entire film, but we never learn 
    what the creature is or why its bite <A HREF="exposure_2018_monster_photo.htm">turns
     James into some kind of monster</A> who can shoot tentacles out of 
    his body! And speaking of doing stupid things at the worst possible 
    time, after getting slashed in the face by a transforming James, Myra 
    hops in the car and drives away, only to come back when she sees a 
    photo of her and James during a happy time in their relationship! Are 
    you fucking kidding me? Not only did she cheat on her husband, only 
    to have him physically abuse her, she returns after he abuses her 
    again??? The #MeToo movement would have a lot to say about that 
    decision. Even I have a lot to say about it, but I think &quot;Are 
    you fucking kidding me?&quot; basically covers it. When she returns 
    to the house and shows her monster husband the photo, thinking it 
    will turn him back to his normal self (Are you fucking kidding me?), 
    she finds out the exact opposite, as he slashes her chest with his 
    clawed hands and then shoots a tongue out of his mouth that looks 
    like an uncircumcised penis (!) and begins licking her face. Myra 
    then bites it off, reaches into his chest (for some reason, there's a 
    hole there) and pulls out his heart! Made for only $20,000, this film 
    looks beautiful, but with characters we don't give two fucks about 
    (Lynn Lowry, who is only in the film for about five minutes, is the 
    best aspect here), I have to ask myself why bother? We don't even get 
    an explanation what the creature is or why its bite transforms 
    people. It just is what it is. Mercifully short at 77 minutes, this 
    film is still overlong by about 60 minutes. And let's not talk about 
    Myra's nose ring and her heavily tatted body (both a major turn-off 
    to me). There are brief flashes of nudity and some graphic violence, 
    but when it happens to two people we don't give two shits about, it 
    amounts to nothing. Director/producer/co-screenwriter Austin Snell 
    knows how to make a good-looking film (he was also the 
    cinematographer), but he needs better material to make audiences 
    care. Not a total failure (the practical makeup effects are pretty 
    good), but bad enough to be put in this category.;<A NAME="Flight666-2018"></A> <B><A HREF="flight_666_2018.htm">FLIGHT
     666</A></B> (2018) starts out like gangbusters, but quickly 
    degenerates into something all too common. Once you learn this film 
    is from The Asylum, that should tell you all you need to know. A 
    flight to New York is surrounded by a storm that doesn't seem to have 
    a beginning or an end, it seems to be following the plane, trapping 
    it inside. Passengers aboard the plane begin to become possessed by 
    female spirits, one missing an eye and another carrying a crying 
    decomposed baby. These women are trying to tell the passengers 
    something important, something that an air marshal on the plane, 
    Austin (Paul Logan), is determined to discover. After searching the 
    cargo hold of the plane, they find evidence that someone on board the 
    plane is a serial killer, someone who travels from city to city 
    killing women just because they love killing. When the serial killer 
    turns out to be the plane's pilot, Captain Jack Hanstock (Joseph M. 
    Harris), the passengers must find a way, with the help of the female 
    spirits on board, to punish the pilot and still land the plane 
    safely. It won't be easy, because the female spirits are only 
    interested in revenge, putting everyone's lives in extreme danger. 
    While there are some very good jump scares in this film, the basic 
    plot falls apart faster than a swimsuit made of paper and quickly 
    becomes a barrage of lousy CGI effects, something The Asylum is well 
    known for. Even the plane's crash landing is awful, a mixture of 
    crappy CGI and some forced perspective cinematography. Director Rob 
    Pallatina, who is usually an editor on some of The Asylum's 
    &quot;mockumentaries&quot;, including <B><A HREF="bigfoot_2012.htm">BIGFOOT</A></B>

    (2016; reviewed in this section) starts off with a sure hand, but he 
    can't sustain it with the screenplay's scene-after-scene of deja vu 
    and pat situations. I had high hopes in the beginning, but it quickly 
    turned into &quot;watching the clock for the film to end.&quot; Too 
    bad. This could have been something with a completed script. All it

    TEMPLE OF THE UNDEAD</A></B> (2018) is a ridiculously bloody and gory 
    horror film that is severely hampered by extremely bad acting and a 
    cliche-ridden script. It seems the U.S. government put Nazi 
    scientists to work after the end of World War II and in the 1950's, 
    one Nazi scientist, Dr. Baumgartner (Peer Metze), is trying to create 
    the perfect &quot;Master Race&quot; with his top-secret formula 
    somewhere in the jungles of South America, but he fails time and time 
    again, turning his subjects into zombie-like creatures that crave the 
    taste of flesh. Cut to the present day, where three stereotypical 
    young men, including jock John (Ryan Sobolski), wise-ass Ethan (Guy 
    Talon) and nerd Daniel (Jonathan Looper), <A HREF="dead_squad_temple_of_the_undead_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/dead squad temple of the undead poster6 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>meet
     three equally stereotypical young women, including the Paris 
    Hilton-like Tiffany (Bianca Zouppas, who is simply awful), tough 
    chick Aneesha (Alina Carson) and nerdy Jennifer (Elizabeth Morse), at 
    some tropical paradise in some unnamed South American country. Yep, 
    you guessed it, the same country where the illicit experiments were 
    performed in the '50s. The guys and gals hook up, get drunk and 
    decide to take a boat trip down the river, where they are warned to 
    stay on the marked trail. Quicker than you can say, &quot;Fuck the 
    rules&quot;, this sextet of worthless human meat take a right hand 
    fork in the river, where it is clearly marked &quot;Do Not Enter&quot;
     and find a beautiful waterfall paradise. Of course they lose their 
    boat when they decide to take a dip in the waterfall, forcing them to 
    travel by foot trying to get back to civilization. As night begins to 
    fall, they discover what they think is an ancient Mayan temple and 
    decide to stay there for the night. As you can probably guess, the 
    temple is actually the base of Dr, Baumgartner's experiments and the 
    six young people try to avoid all the zombies that are still living 
    there. Most of them are not successful, as they are ripped apart and

    to offer: The makeup effects are mostly practical and they are as 
    bloody and gory as they come (which makes me wonder if the film's 
    R-Rating is a fallacy), as heads and spines are torn out of bodies, 
    heads are crushed and brain matter squirts out in gallons, chunks of 
    flesh are eaten from bodies and Tiffany is one of the first to die 
    (Believe me, once you see Bianca Zouppas' acting, you will appreciate 
    this!). The Bali, Indonesia locations are also very colorful and add 
    a lot to the visual splendor of the film. Now the bad parts: The 
    acting is strictly second-rate and it is clear that 
    director/producer/writer/music composer Dominik Hauser (his first 
    film as a director; he's a music composer by trade) bit off more than 
    he could chew, as his script (which he shared with co-writer Nancy 
    Thornhill) contains so many holes and unbelievable coincidences, as 
    well as hackneyed dialogue, it is difficult to overlook and forgive. 
    It's just sloppy. Some of the character's actions are unbelievable 
    and you'll be throwing up your hands in total disbelief more than one 
    time, especially when Aneesha reveals who she actually is and why she 
    is doing it (This is where the film falls completely apart). But, if 
    it's blood and guts you want, this film is hard to beat. You'll see 
    such unusual sights as a zombie that is nothing but half a torso with 
    its spine and skull walking towards the cast, a &quot;Zombie 
    Wife&quot; (R&eacute;ka Gavaldi), who is seemingly married to Z13 and 
    a &quot;Zombie Queen&quot; (Erika Ervin), who wants Z13 as her own, 
    even performing oral sex on him! There are a lot of other good 
    practical effects on view and the blood flows like water, but the 
    film as a whole fails to entertain. It's too off-center to be 
    entertaining. Nice try, though, but it is still a disappointment. As 
    is usual for these DTV films, there is a mid-end credits scene which 
    sets the film up for a sequel. Let's hope it is more entertaining 
    than this one, if it is made at all.;<A NAME="DeathKiss2018"></A>&nbsp;

    third-rate version of <B><A HREF="death_wish_1974.htm">DEATH WISH</A></B> 
    (1974), with the added &quot;bonus&quot; of Robert Kovacs, a.k.a. 
    &quot;Robert Bronzi&quot;, who looks exactly like Charles Bronson, 
    but with one or two caveats: He can't act worth a lick and his voice 
    is obviously dubbed by someone else. It also comes as no surprise 
    that this film was directed by Rene Perez (<B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#DeadDamned2010">THE
     DEAD AND THE DAMNED</A></B> - 2010; <B><A HREF="burning_dead_2015.htm">THE
     BURNING DEAD</A></B> - 2015), who hires has-been actors (i.e. Daniel 
    Baldwin) for his films, but has no idea how to use them to their best 
    advantage. In other words, I have yet to see a Perez film that I 
    like, this one included. It is a slow-moving tale about an unnamed 
    vigilante (Kovacs) who goes around shooting criminals, including drug 
    dealers (one portrayed by Richard Tyson; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hayride2013">HAYRIDE</A></B> 
    - 2013; he looks embarrassed being in this, even though he also has 
    an Associate Producer credit here) and child slave traders, and then 
    sends a load of money to single mother Ana (Eva Hamilton, the best 
    thing about this film) and her paralyzed young daughter, who was shot 
    in the spine when she was younger when her mother tried to score 
    drugs at a drug den, while a radio talk show host (Baldwin) rambles 
    on and on about how the police are useless regarding serious crime. 
    Ana has cleaned up her act and the vigilante's money gave her enough 
    to put a down payment on a house in the country, but it doesn't take 
    a genius to know why he is sending her the money. Robert Kovacs being 
    dubbed takes the viewer completely out of the film, because it is 
    plain to see that he is speaking English, but his Spanish accent was 
    replaced with someone trying to sound like Charles Bronson and it 
    doesn't work. If I have one good thing to say about this film it is 
    that the bullet squibs are very bloody and whenever anyone gets shot, 
    nearly a pint of blood comes out of their bullet holes. Otherwise, 
    this is a chore to get through, as its situations are pat and there's 
    not much meat on its bones. The action scenes are also lazily staged 
    and downright sloppy at times. Avoid at all costs unless you want to 
    watch someone pretending to be Bronson. Perez also gave us the 
    terrible <B><A HREF="from_hell_to_the_wild_west_2017.htm">FROM HELL

    battles a transplanted Jack The Ripper in the Wild West! Both films 
    are available streaming on Amazon Prime for all the masochists out 
    there. Where does Perez get money to make these abominations?;<A NAME="Punished2018"></A> 
    Speaking of prolific badfilm director Rene Perez, his film <B><A HREF="punished_2018.htm">THE
     PUNISHED</A></B> (2018) is a badly-acted, haphazardly-staged action 
    film that is nothing but a paid tour through Turtle Bay Exploration 
    Park, a Redding, California water park. Mercenary Wolfgang (Austrian 
    bodybuilder/actor Robert Amstler, an Arnold Schwarzenegger stunt 
    double; Once you see him and hear him talk, you will know why!) is a 
    ruthless killer, hired by an old rich businesswoman (Lisa Murphy 
    Collins), who lost her three-year old grandson to a random act of 
    senseless street violence, to retrieve a collection of cell phones 
    for reasons better left alone (because of the stupidity of it all). 
    During one of Wolfgang's killing missions, he gets shot in the back 
    and has to go to the hospital (when a doctor looks at the wound on 
    Wolfgang's back and asks him how he got it, he just says, &quot;I 
    fell.&quot;), where he meets a young orphan girl named Maria (Leia 
    Perez), who needs medical attention every day of her life (&quot;I 
    was born sick.&quot;). Wolfgang decides to mix his life of violence 
    with random acts of kindness, so he takes Maria to Turtle Bay and 
    spoils her, hiring park worker Lisa (Nicole Stark) to be Maria's tour 
    guide. Long story short, in between violent escapades, Wolfgang 
    begins to care deeply for Maria and Lisa begins to care deeply for 
    Wolfgang, but will any of it be acted upon? Do we really care? This 
    film has zero entertainment value, thanks to director Perez, who has 
    an uncanny ability to have lens flares in nearly every outdoor scene. 
    If it isn't lens flares, it's bathing outdoor scenes in purple hues, 
    which becomes very bothersome, ruining most of the scenes. What this 
    film does display perfectly are all the attractions Turtle Bay 
    Exploration Park offers, as we see Wolfgang, Lisa and Maria enjoy 
    water slides, trampolines, rafting, jet boats (including the 
    &quot;Jetovator&quot;), paddleboard yoga (!)&nbsp; and other water 
    attractions the park offers. If this is a paid ad for the park, it 
    works, but as an action film it fails miserably. Wolfgang is a man of 
    few words, his sentences barely more than three words. This film 
    tries to get audiences to believe we are watching a <B><A HREF="punisher_netflix_series_2017.htm">PUNISHER</A></B> 
    film (Amstler even dons a Punisher mask in two of his violent 
    missions, in one, he forces an innocent man to kill someone so he 
    won't turn the security camera footage over to the police!), but this 
    no-budget film can't reach such lofty ambitions. Perez has found his 
    Bronson replacement in Robert Kovacs and he has also found his 
    Schwarzenegger replacement in Robert Amstler, but the sad fact is 
    neither of them can act a lick and they have zero chemistry on 
    screen. Oh, and <A NAME="ItCameDesert2018"></A><A HREF="it_came_from_the_desert_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/it came from the desert dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>did

    (2015-2019), but I keep trying. Will I ever learn? I doubt it.; <B><A HREF="it_came_from_the_desert_2018.htm">IT
     CAME FROM THE DESERT</A></B> (2018), based on the early-'80s 8-bit 
    video game of the same name, starts out well enough, but then 
    completely falls apart. Three typical young adults, Brian (Harry 
    Lister Smith), Lisa (Vanessa Grasse) and air-headed Lukas (Alex 
    Mills, who reminds me of a young Timothy Olyphant), head out to a 
    booze-filled weekend of partying and motocross riding, when they 
    discover a hidden laboratory in a cave that houses giant ants. It's 
    not long before these ants escape and attack everyone at the party, 
    bringing their still-alive bodies back to their nest to feed their 
    queen. It is up to this trio, who have serious personal problems 
    (Brian loves Lisa and doesn't know she feels the same way, thinking 
    she like Lukas better), to free the others before they become chow 
    for the queen and kill all the ants before they get to civilization 
    and multiply quickly to take over the world. That's the basic plot of 
    this Finland-lensed flick, directed by Marko M&auml;kilaakso (<B><A HREF="war_of_the_dead_2011.htm">WAR
     OF THE DEAD</A></B> - 2011), who co-wrote the generic screenplay 
    with Hank Woon Jr. and Trent Haaga (<B><A HREF="dead_girl_2008.htm">DEADGIRL</A></B> 
    - 2008), which is why this film is in this category. The CGI and 
    anamatronic giant ants are very well done, better than films with ten 
    times the budget, but the acting and plot leave a lot to be desired. 
    Only Alex Mills manages to register in his role of Lukas, as the rest 
    of the cast, including the minor players, are weak&nbsp; imprints of 
    the way real people would act when put in situations this film 
    offers. It's all played rather broadly and, as a viewer, we know 
    exactly what is going to happen next and it does, no surprises or 
    twists are on view. This is not a badly made film, just a typical DTV 
    horror/actioner. The photography is very well done for such a low 
    budget affair, especially the motocross scenes, as people try to 
    escape the invading giant ants on their motorcycles, but it is a 
    losing proposition because the ants are faster. As a player of the 
    actual video game, I can attest to the fact that this film follows 
    the game very closely, but what is fun on the computer is very 
    cliched as a film, which proves one thing to me: video games should 
    not be turned into films because more times than naught, they are 
    very boring and tepid. For its budget, this is a very well made film, 
    but the story is lacking in entertainment value. Stay through the end 
    credits for a view of a full replay of the entire video game. If you 
    have ever played it, nostalgia will rush over your body like a cold 
    wave of ocean water.;<A NAME="BookMonsters2018"></A> <B><A HREF="book_of_monsters_2018.htm">BOOK
     OF MONSTERS</A></B> (2018) is a British horror comedy that was 
    crowdfunded on Kickstarter. It is a film too cheap for its own good, 
    full of missed opportunities, sloppy writing and monsters who look 
    like people in Halloween costumes. Young lesbian Sophie (Lyndsey 
    Craine) is about to have her eighteenth birthday party, not knowing 
    she is about to unleash monsters that killed her mother when Sophie 
    was a young child. Mom loved reading Sophie bedtime stories from the 
    book of the title, but one night, some real monsters drag Sophie's 
    mom under her bed and kill her. Sophie's father (Nicholas Vince) 
    gives Sophie the book on the day of her 18th birthday, not knowing 
    that Sophie is needed by five monsters as a sacrifice to open the 
    gates of Hell and unleash all the monsters on Earth, turning it into 
    a planet of evil. Just for convenience, Dad leaves the house on 
    Sophie's birthday, so her schoolmates, Mona (Michaela Longden), Beth 
    (Lizzie Stanton) and Jess (Rose Muirhead), can throw her the birthday 
    party of all birthday parties, not knowing that the school snob, Arya 
    (Anna Dawson), has sabotaged the party, inviting only the dregs of 
    society to the party. One of those dregs is Pandora (Steph Mossman) a 
    shapeshifting monster who gets the ball rolling by killing a<A HREF="book_of_monsters_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/book of monsters poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    male virgin by tempting him with sex in Sophie's bedroom. This 
    triggers an onslaught of monsters to the party, one of them, called 
    the Beast, breaks down the front door and begins killing the partiers 
    in various gory ways, it's preferred method being ripping off heads 
    from bodies. Sophie uses the book, which turns out to be a monster 
    fighting bible written by her mother, to kill the monsters. This is 
    where the film falls apart. Killing these monsters is too damn easy. 
    The Beast has a huge boil on its back that is its weak spot, so 
    Sophie grabs her birthday cake knife and stabs it in the boil, 
    killing it instantly. There's another monster outside called The 
    Slasher, who kills nearly everyone that escapes the house with 
    well-placed sickles, which it throws at the partiers. The Slasher 
    also releases worm-like creatures that can take form of anything they 
    touch, so they take the form of three garden gnomes and attack male 
    stripper Carl (Arron Dennis, the best performance in the film), who 
    kills them with his vibrating dildo! (Ayra hired a male stripper just 
    to embarrass lesbian Sophie, because she's, well, evil). Sophie joins 
    forces with her three female friends and male party-goer Gary (Daniel 
    Thrace) to fight the monsters, discovering that Sophie's mom was a 
    kick-ass monster fighter in her day, leaving her daughter 
    instructions in the book as how to kill each individual monster. This 
    gory film, directed/co-produced by Stewart Sparke (<B><A HREF="creature_below_2016.htm">THE
     CREATURE BELOW</A></B> - 2016) and written by co-producer Paul 
    Butler (who portrays The Slasher in some scenes), fails to make an 
    impression, even though it is very gory and somewhat funny. For 
    starters, the gore is not very well done and the monsters not very 
    believable (they look like people in costumes rather than outright 
    monsters) and some of the scenes are far too convenient to be 
    believable. When the remaining people are trapped in the house, 
    Sophie suddenly remembers that her house went through a remodeling 
    when she was a child and they find a secret passage that leads to the 
    barn, where her mother had a secret room full of weapons and 
    monster-related information, along with a tape recorder that mom left 
    a final message for her daughter. Not only is this coincidence far 
    too unbelievable for its own good, when Sophie picks up a chainsaw in 
    the secret room to fight the monster with, it immediately starts up, 
    after sitting in the room for ten years! Sloppy writing like this 
    makes the film seem hackneyed and desperate. A missed opportunity 
    comes when the worm creatures turn into the garden gnomes, which are 
    killed off far too easily. It would have been nice to see these worms 
    turn into something else rather than have them killed off without 
    giving them any backstory (and they look like <B><A HREF="ghoulies_1985.htm">GHOULIES</A></B>!).
     I saw this film for free streaming on Amazon Prime and at 81-minutes 
    in length, it didn't chew up much of my free time, but when it ended 
    (stayed tuned during the final credits for a closing sting), it left 
    me feeling that it could have been so much better. It's not awful,

    (2018) is a Found Footage film made in Germany, but it contains 
    everything that is wrong with these cheaply-made flicks. It is also 
    full of so many clich&eacute;s, even clich&eacute;s are yelling out, 
    &quot;Enough already, you are making us look bad!&quot; A college 
    girl named Mary Sheffield (Olivia Dean) doesn't believe in ghosts and 
    believes the 99% of paranormal videos that are shown on YouTube are 
    fake (something I also believe) and the remaining one percent is just 
    unexplained (strange things happen that we have no explanation 
    for...yet). Her roommate and potential love interest (at least that 
    is what he would like, but she is too interested in other things, 
    like finding a subject for her final college thesis), Josh (Josh 
    Madry), shows her a paranormal video he found on the dark web that 
    shows three paranormal investigators being murdered by a <A HREF="paranormal_demons_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/paranormal demons amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>creature
     called &quot;The Golem&quot; (that's what it is named in the closing 
    credits, even if it is not spoken once in the film) and when Mary 
    views it, she finds a subject for her college thesis, debunking the 
    video as fake by traveling to the house where the three people were 
    supposedly killed and prove that all of it was faked, even though 
    Josh believes it is real. Mary hires a professional cinematographer 
    named David (played by director/writer/producer/editor/cinematographer/musician/toilet
     scrubber David Br&uuml;ckner) to give her film a polished look and 
    invites friends Julia (Ildiko Preszly) and Michael (Sebastian 
    Matthias Wei&szlig;bach) to come along with them as emotional support 
    (Josh wanted to handle camera duties, but Mary makes him the producer 
    instead, which forms an instant distrust between him and David). 
    Their first stop is medium Mrs. White (Kristina Kostiv), who forbids 
    Michael to come inside (he was rude to her), where a seance is 
    performed. As we expect, it doesn't go well at all, as something 
    possesses Mrs. White, forcing everyone to run outside, hop in their 
    van and head to their destination. Once they get to the 
    &quot;murder&quot; house, Mary is nearly choked to death by the 
    caretaker of the house (Michael Krug), but Michael pulls out a pistol 
    and forces the caretaker to leave (He tells everyone not to worry 
    because the pistol is full of blanks. Of course, he is lying.). After 
    about 75 minutes of nearly nothing happening, the Golem (played by 
    the single monickered Moloch) begins killing the group one-by-one, 
    but Mary is still convinced that all this can be explained reasonably 
    and none of it is supernatural. That is, until the finale, where the 
    Golem kills Mary, Josh and cameraman David and no one survives. THE 
    END. Where do I begin? Whenever the Golem is near, the cameras go all 
    wonky and static-y, so the viewer can't quite make what the Golem 
    looks like (at least not until the final minutes). It's quite 
    maddening, as half the footage in this film is of the wonky kind, 
    giving the viewers extreme headaches. And when we do see the Golem, 
    all it is is a huge man with a burlap sack over his head, that looks 
    like it was covered with paper mach&eacute; (we never do see his 
    face)! Toss in clich&eacute;s like no cell phone service and the car 
    refusing to start and what you have is a film that is better 
    forgotten. Better yet, don't watch it at all and save 96 minutes of 
    your life for more important things, like painting your crab grass 
    green so the neighbors don't complain. There's so many things wrong 
    with this film, such as director David Br&uuml;ckner's fascination 
    with a camera drone he most probably just purchased, using it various 
    times to show us nothing but overhead views of where the group is, 
    which offers nothing to the film (we hear the drone buzzing whenever 
    it is on screen, something most filmmakers edit out with music or 
    silence). There's not one nice thing I can say about the film, even 
    when the blood starts to flow, as it is only displayed with wonky 
    footage, such as when the Golem rips off David's head with his bare 
    hands or eviscerates Julia in the stomach with a scythe and fondles 
    her innards. It's all too little, too late and what stymies me is 
    that some reviewers actually like this film! Nothing is explained, 
    like most YouTube paranormal videos, so biting the hand that feeds 
    you (I saw this film streaming on YouTube [on channel &quot;Horror 
    Central&quot;], even though it's also available on Amazon Prime) 
    seems kinda simple-minded. Only for those who wish to have 96 minutes 
    seem like a lifetime, All others should just ignore it. I have to 
    watch this crap, so you don't have to.</FONT></FONT></P>

     DTV Genre Films Part 26 (continued): <B><A HREF="chair_to_everywhere_2018.htm">THE
     CHAIR TO EVERYWHERE</A></B> (2018) is a British sci-fi no-budgeter 
    whose aspirations are much larger than the measly budget allows, but 
    it is not without some positive points; mainly, it will have you 
    thinking long after the film ends. A father, Graham (Sean Botha), and 
    his daughter, Laura (Polly Tregear), invent a prototype teleportation 
    device (it couldn't look cheaper if it tried!) to transport people 
    from one place to another after losing their wife/mother in an 
    airline accident. But there are some serious issues with this device. 
    Instead of transporting a human body from one place to another, it 
    actually creates a duplicate, so the original human has to be killed 
    (!) while they are being teleported, otherwise there will be a 
    displacement in the time continuum (Don't think about it. Your brain 
    might explode!). Laura volunteers to be the guinea pig and the first 
    time they try to teleport her, her clothes catch on fire. Turns out 
    the device can only teleport organic matter (Shouldn't they have 
    known that?), so Laura strips completely naked (she's not bashful 
    about it) and tries again. The second time they try, <A HREF="chair_to_everywhere_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/chair to everywhere amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Laura's
     mouth becomes painful and it turns out she has a metal filling in a 
    tooth, so she makes her father pull out the tooth with a pair of 
    pliers! The third try is the charm, as the device teleports her 
    successfully, Graham killing his daughter by strangulation before her 
    duplicate appears (the dead bodies then disappear into the ether). 
    Since both the transmitting and receiving devices are in the same 
    room, Laura wants to move them further apart, so they move the 
    receiving device to the other end of the room (I told you this film 
    was cheap!). The fourth time they try (Instead of strangling Laura, 
    he injects an air bubble in her neck causing her to pass out, then he 
    strangles her with the rope!), it seems successful, but Laura 
    disappears and another naked girl appears in the receiving chair. 
    She's from a planet in a different universe and apparently their 
    teleportation device got cross-entangled in his, sending his daughter 
    to the other planet and this woman to his. She tells him if he wants 
    his daughter back, he needs to teleport her immediately, so he does, 
    but another woman appears, not his daughter. He does this dozens of 
    times, killing all these different naked women while they are 
    teleporting until his hands are bloody and raw with rope burns! His 
    next attempt turns out to be disastrous, as he accidentally kills the 
    naked woman before she teleports and no one comes back. So what does 
    he do? Luckily, a woman from a missing child agency (WTF?!?!) knocks 
    on his door and asks for a donation, so he knocks her out, strips her 
    and then teleports her, killing her at the right time. This time, 
    another woman comes back, but she says she knows Laura and if he 
    teleports her at the right time, she will come back to him. This time 
    he is successful, but there is a price to pay for his actions. I 
    won't tell you what it is, other to say that the CGI in this sequence 
    is way below par and ruins the finale, but like I said, you'll be 
    thinking about all this long after the film is over. I know I did, 
    but that doesn't excuse the film's cheapness and bad acting. Sean 
    Botha is simply awful as Graham. He always looks like he is about o 
    break out bawling at any time and his line delivery leaves a lot to 
    be desired. Thankfully, there is a lot of full-frontal female nudity 
    here, as every woman that comes back shows us the full monty, but why 
    do women from different planets in another universe all speak with a 
    British accent? And why are no men coming back? There's actually an 
    answer for that one in the finale, but like I said, the cheap 
    dimestore CGI ruins the overall effect of the film. I do give

    a film with high intellectual aspirations on a nothing budget, but it 
    simply isn't enough for me to recommend this film. There's also a 
    wince-inducing scene where Laura sleeps with her father the night 
    before she tries to teleport for the first that will make you feel 
    extremely uncomfortable, especially when Laura tells her wary father 
    that it's okay, she just wants to cuddle! UGH! It's not a complete 
    failure, but it's enough to be put in the Bad Category. Better luck

    Prime, is one of those films I wanted to turn off after watching it 
    for five minutes, but I can't, because once I start watching a movie, 
    I finish it (It's both a gift and a curse). This is one of the worst 
    acted pieces of crap I have ever laid eyes upon (All of the 
    &quot;actors&quot; here are mainly bit or background actors, except 
    for Ari Lehman, the original Jason Vorhees in <B><A HREF="friday_the_13th_1980.htm">FRIDAY

    [1978], but even they stink on ice here.), as well as being boring as 
    all fuck, with effects that are of the Ten Cent Store variety (I 
    could buy most of them at my nearest Army &amp; Navy store!). Based 
    on the real-life Clown Motel in Tonopah, Nevada, this flick also has 
    the nerve to depict the hotel as the only building in the middle of 
    nowhere, when Tonopah is actually a very bustling little town, with 
    its own gas station, eateries and even a casino! It's also a very 
    busy truck stop destination, a mid-point destination where truckers 
    can sleep for the night (it has several motels and hotels besides 
    this one), get something to eat, fill up their diesel tanks and lose 
    all their money at the same time! This film finds a trio of male 
    ghost hunters who are running a fledgling YouTube paranormal channel <A HREF="clown_motel_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/clown motel dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="153" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(they
     only have 200 subscribers!) running into a quartet of women, on 
    their way to Las Vegas to have a bachelorette party for their best 
    friend Brooke (Elinor Price), at the titled motel. The guys want to 
    tape a show at the Clown Motel since it is reportedly a hotbed of 
    paranormal activity and the women end up there when they drive into a 
    mysterious cloud, which results in them ending up at the motel no 
    matter what direction they travel. Too tired to drive any more, the 
    women bed down with the three man, after they falsely tell them that 
    it is the only room available (Can't they see that no one else is 
    there?). What they don't know is that the hotel was rebuilt about 30 
    years ago when some country hicks discovered that a family of clowns 
    lived there (headed by father Pyscan [Lehman; <B><A HREF="#Barn2016">THE
     BARN</A></B> - 2016]) and they are mining for gold in a nearby cave 
    and getting rich because of it. The clown family is non-violent, but 
    they don't trust &quot;humans&quot; because of their propensity for 
    violence towards things they don't understand (such as clowns), but 
    when the hicks burn down the motel, stealing the gold and killing the 
    entire clown clan, they return from the afterlife (from the cemetery 
    next to the motel, the only piece of truth in this entire film [the 
    cemetery, not the clowns returning from the dead!]) to kill anyone 
    who dares use their motel. That's basically the plot of the film, as 
    all of the humans are picked-off one-by-one (after their vehicles are 
    disabled) by the ghostly clown family, for every one they kill allows 
    another member of their clown family to return from the Great Beyond. 
    I can't begin to describe how awful this film is acted (it's like 
    watching a grade school play) and the clowns' makeups are so 
    threadbare and lousy, they wouldn't scare a baby. The effects are no 
    better, the most graphic being midget clown Loco (Martin Klebba; 
    &quot;Marty&quot; in the <B><A HREF="pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl_2003.htm">PIRATES
     FROM THE CARIBBEAN</A></B> franchise [2003 - 2017]) thrusting a 
    crowbar through Casey's (Amanda Kott) left breast. We really don't 
    see anything since it is done through her blouse. All the gore are of 
    the after-effects of the murders, as we never see a clown murder 
    anyone, except Crank the Clown (Robert B. Oliver) shoving a wiper 
    blade into Chris' (Donald Schell) mouth and blood comes gushing out. 
    Another clown rips off the arms of Ian (Steven Vogel) but it's quite 
    obvious his arms are tied to the back of his shirt (and he hardly 
    bleeds!). He is then beaten to death with one of his own arms. This 
    movie tries to be funny in spots, showing overweight clown Hammy 
    (Johnny Perotti) masturbating with a canned ham (!), before he grabs 
    Spencer (Eric Prochnau) and butt-fucks him, but the comic moments 
    (such as Pyscan killing Kristen [Angeline Mirenda] with a bowling pin 
    while yelling, &quot;Respect the testicles!&quot; after she kicks him 
    in the nuts), are flatter than the serious parts, so why bother? I 
    could mention director/screenwriter Joseph Kelly's other credits (he 
    also has a bit part here), but why would I want to torture you with 
    that? This is a film best avoided at all costs. Believe me. The only 
    positive thing I can say about this is that Pyscan's young daughter, 
    Silly Lilly (Chalet Lizette Brannan; <B><A HREF="#StrangeNature2018">STRANGE
     NATURE</A></B> - 2018) delivers the best performance in the entire 
    film. Leave it to a child to show the adults how to do something 
    right! Based on a short Kelly directed in 2016. The film also has a 
    non-concluding finale, where nothing is resolved, probably so Joseph 
    Kelly could film the eventual sequel (Due sometime in 2020). Pray it 
    doesn't happen. Pray hard.; The story behind the making of <B><A HREF="masked_mutilator_1994-2018.htm">MASKED
     MUTILATOR</A><A NAME="MaskedMutilator"></A></B> (1994/2018) is more 
    interesting than the film itself. Financed by a group of minor 
    wrestling figures and their managers, this film was started in 
    Pennsylvania in 1994, where 80% of it was finished before they 
    discovered that there were some gaping holes in the plot that they 
    thought couldn't be fixed, so they abandoned the project until they 
    could find a way to fix it. Flash-forward 24 years later (!) and&nbsp;
     a way to complete the film was discovered, but there was no money to 
    finish it. They took the film to Severin Films head David Gregory, 
    who agreed to film the wraparound segments that would complete the 
    film, but only if his sublabel, InterVision Picture Corp., could 
    distribute it on Blu-Ray &amp; DVD. An agreement was reached and this 
    was the result, a rather tame mash-up of wrestling and slasher 
    genres. I was hoping for something better than what was delivered, 
    but it still is a nice time capsule where wrestlers-turned-filmmakers 
    decided to make a horror film on celluloid, rather than video. The 
    results are semi-professional, but disappointing, because the 
    violence is pulled-back rather than going full-steam ahead. A 
    wrestler going under the name of the Masked Mutilator (former 
    wrestler Jeff Sibbach) accidentally (?) kills an opponent in the 
    ring, so he loses his right to wrestle anywhere and has to take a job 
    as the head of a group home for troubled youths that is under-funded 
    and under-staffed. He uses his real name, &quot;Vic Mangino&quot; so 
    no one knows he was the Masked Mutilator, but everyone, including the 
    snotty, overaged teens in his charge already do. He is forced to 
    take-in an apprentice college kid named Steve Carson (wrestler/actor 
    Brick Bronsky; Troma's <B><A HREF="sgt_kabukiman_nypd_1990.htm">SGT.

     say, &quot;Fuckin' overage teenagers!&quot;, someone dressed as the 
    Masked Mutilator begins killing the teens in the group home 
    one-by-one. It's not hard to figure out who it is because there are 
    precious few suspects, only Vic, Steve and the overweight cook, Carl 
    (Doug Yasinsky), but only one of them has the physique of the Masked 
    Mutilator killer. Yes, it's Steve. He is killing teens because, years 
    earlier, he watched teens from this very same group home rape and 
    murder his sister while making him watch. This short, 76-minute film, 
    is short on logic and, like I said before, the gore is sparse, which 
    is surprising, since Glenn Hetrick and Paul Sutt (who both have roles 
    in this film), are well-respected special effects makeup experts, 
    supplying bloody effects to films such as <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#King Ants">KING
     OF THE ANTS</A></B> (2004); <B><A HREF="300_2006.htm">300</A></B> 
    (2006); and <B><A HREF="feast_2_sloppy_seconds_2008.htm">FEAST II: 
    SLOPPY SECONDS</A></B> (2008). On this film, all they do is splash 
    plenty of blood on the victims' faces and bodies; no open wounds, no 
    gushing blood. In their defense, they were just getting started in 
    the field of special makeup effects. On the plus side, there's some 
    brutal wrestling and martial arts fighting in the film, made all the 
    more believable because they were wrestlers. The short running time 
    may find you more forgiving than if the film ran ten minutes longer. 
    So how did they &quot;fix&quot; this film? Well, the wraparound 
    segments are of a podcast where one of the teens, Brian Worth (Tom 
    Taylor, who returns from the original footage no longer a teen!), 
    explains what went on at the group home when the murders were taking 
    place. The 1994 film is then shown as a long flashback. It works in 
    the film's favor, at least to some degree, but the sad fact is that 
    the mystery is not much of a mystery at all if you don't have enough 
    red herrings to throw off the viewer (Screenplay by Ed Polgardy &amp; 
    Dale Schneck, their only writing credit, although Polgardy is a 
    respected Producer of such films as <B><A HREF="halfway_house_2004.htm">THE

     TO REST</A></B> - 2009). A nice try, but it ultimately fails. Look 
    for a young James DeBello (<B><A HREF="cabin_fever_2002.htm">CABIN FEVER</A></B> 
    - 2002) in a flashback as a young Steve Carson (which is actually a 
    flashback-within-a-flashback in the re-worked film!). Also starring 
    Heidi Shelhamer (as Brian's virginal new girlfriend, Leslie), Andrew 
    Denzel, Chet Cole and Amanda Kupchinsky as Marcy, the group home 
    slut, who provides the film's only topless nudity. Do yourself a

    Since I have been in charge of this website for over 20 years, I do

    (usually on Vimeo). I turn down nearly all of them, because I don't 
    want to feel beholden to anyone for giving me a film for free. I feel 
    as if I am put in a corner, obligated to giving the film a positive 
    review, which I would never do unless it is actually good. Then,

    (2018), an Italian horror film (filmed in English with 
    English-subtitles whenever someone speaks Italian [which isn't very 
    often]) that I have read many good reviews about. I accepted October 
    Coast Releasing's (the company who is distributing the film on VOD 
    early in December 2019, with an eventual DVD release later) offer to 
    watch the film (after they sent me the password to unlock the film on 
    Vimeo) and, low and behold, the film stinks on ice! Director Emiliano 
    Ranzani (his first feature film), who co-wrote the screenplay with 
    Davide Mela (his first feature film screenplay, as well as being this 
    film's Executive Producer), has delivered a horror film that lacks 
    horror or any type of coherent plot. The film opens with two 
    burglars, Tony (Riccardo Leto) and Alex (Emanuele Turetta), breaking 
    into an abandoned mansion to steal any valuables they can find (Which 
    begs the question: Why would these two thieves even think there were 
    valuables in an abandoned mansion?). A misshapen Creature sneaks up 
    behind Tony and stabs him repeatedly with a large knife, killing him. 
    When Alex sees Tony's dead body and the Creature coming after him 
    (apparently, the Creature can only see in black &amp; white, as its 
    frequent POV shots show<A HREF="blood_bags_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/blood bags poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    us!), he runs away, his fate left up in the air. We then switch to 
    two female friends, American architecture college student Tracy 
    (Makenna Guyler; <B><A HREF="coulrophobia_2015.htm">COULROPHOBIA</A></B> 
    - 2015), who has come to Italy to do her thesis on Italy's ancient 
    and beautiful architectual buildings (something I always wanted to 
    do!), and Italian slut Petra (Marta Tananyan), who will screw anyone 
    with two legs and a cock. These girls are the exact opposite of each 
    other, because Tracy has no time for boys or men, since she has to go 
    back to the United States very soon. When she hears about an 
    abandoned mansion that is unusual in its architecture, she drags 
    Petra along with her to take photographs of the mansion, inside and 
    out. I don't have to tell you what mansion this is, do I? Meanwhile, 
    a man is traveling around Italy, collecting bags of blood from 
    people, after they show the man written proof that they are disease 
    and HIV-free. When one woman demands more money from the man for her 
    blood, he simply kills her after collecting her blood and walks away. 
    We then see Tracy and Petra breaking into the mansion, not noticing 
    that elderly caretaker Bruno Cramori (Franco Olivero) has seen them 
    doing it and padlocks the front gate, so they cannot run away. It's 
    not long before the Creature kills Petra and chases Tracy upstairs, 
    but she is saved by Alex, who has been hiding in the house. They 
    can't escape the mansion because all the exits and windows are 
    boarded up, so they must try to kill the Creature. Tracy manages to 
    get one call to the police on her cell phone before the Creature 
    destroys it and two cops, Laura (Denitza Diakovska) and Antonio 
    (Salvatore Palombi) come to the mansion to check it out. Antonio 
    questions Bruno and he tells the officer that the mansion has been 
    empty for a long time, showing him the locked padlock on the front 
    gate, which is too dangerous for anyone to climb to get inside (or 
    outside!) the mansion's grounds. Laura and Antonio then leave, but 
    Antonio believes something is fishy with Bruno, so they return to the 
    mansion and make Bruno unlock the gate so they can enter the mansion. 
    While all of this is happening, we discover that the man collecting 
    the blood, Vittorio (Alberto Sette), is actually the Creature's 
    brother. He collects blood in blood bags so his Creature brother 
    (played by Mario Cellini; <B><A HREF="p.o.e._project_of_evil_2012.htm">P.O.E.:
     PROJECT OF EVIL</A></B> - 2012) can drink it. It's the only way his 
    brother can survive (Don't expect an explanation why he needs blood 
    to survive, because we are never told). So who will live and who will 
    die? It really doesn't matter, because the film throws-in the worst cop-out
     ending I ever witnessed in a long, long time. I can't really tell 
    you what it is because I get mad just thinking about it! Just take my 
    word for it, the final two minutes will make you throw your remote at 
    the TV screen, as both the screenwriters couldn't think of a proper 
    ending, so they just ended it as being all a dream (nightmare?) on 
    Tracy's part, after she is captured by the Creature and faints at the 
    sight of him. When she wakes up, the Creature then slices her to 
    death with his large knife while she is tied to a table (There, I did 
    tell you the fucked-in-the-head finale! Fuck you, film. Sideways!), 
    leaving the film wide-open for an eventual sequel, one I hope is 
    never made. The finale is better if you just ignore the final two 
    cop-out minutes, as it is a better ending than what comes after it 
    (Tracy kills the Creature by stabbing him in the head and body 
    over-and -over with the Creature's own knife, saving both her and a 
    wounded Alex). Although the film is very bloody, most of it is very 
    hard to see, especially the killings in the mansion, which is only 
    lighted with the victims' flashlights (The Creature is a very nice 
    creation, though). Most of the blood and gore comes after the fact, 
    only shown after the murders are committed (a chopped-off hand with a 
    small hatchet; various bloody neck slashings and other impalements, 
    etc.). The worst things about this film are the generic music 
    soundtrack (by Fabio Di Santo &amp; Daniele Prina) and its total lack 
    of pacing. It's a well-shot film, however, but that's not enough for 
    me to give it a positive review, because, frankly, it's rather boring 
    and uneventful. I recommend that you stay away from this film if you 
    don't want to waste 90 minutes of your precious time. There goes any 
    more offers for screeners, but I calls them like I sees them!;<A NAME="HerbertWestRe-An18"></A> <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;If

    consensus in the film community is that the stories by H.P. Lovecraft 
    are unfilmable as written, but that never stopped Italian director 
    Ivan Zuccon from trying to adapt Lovecraft to the screen. Among his 
    Lovecraft films are <B><A HREF="shunned_house_2003.htm">THE SHUNNED HOUSE</A></B> 
    (2003), <B><A HREF="colour_from_the_dark_2008.htm">COLOUR FROM THE DARK</A></B> 
    (2008) and a few others, all of them lacking a budget to give 
    Lovecraft's visions any chance of succeeding.&nbsp; He even directed 
    a few non-Lovecraft films, such as <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm#WrathOfTheCrows2013">WRATH
     OF THE CROWS</A></B> (2013), but they also have a Lovecraft 
    &quot;feel&quot; to them. With his latest, <B><A HREF="herbert_west_re-animator_2018.htm">HERBERT
     WEST: RE-ANIMATOR</A></B> (2018), he gives Lovecraft the old college 
    try, trying to be faithful to Lovecraft's story (a lot more faithful 
    than Stuart Gordon's classic <B><A HREF="reanimator_1985b.htm">RE-ANIMATOR</A></B> 
    - 1985). but lacking a proper budget to bring it to life. It's a 
    valiant try, but the film is mainly a collection of confusing 
    flashbacks and flash-forwards with little connective <A HREF="herbert_west_re-animator_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/herbert west re-animator amazon poster 4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="156" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>tissue
     between scenes and, unless you are a fan of Lovecraft (as I am), 
    you'll be lost as soon as the film begins. I will try to make it less 
    confusing here. When Herbert West's young daughter, Eleanor 
    (Valentina Bivona), dies in a car accident caused by West's wife 
    Elizabeth (Roberta Marrelli), he uses his serum to bring Eleanor back 
    to life, only to discover she has come back without a soul. When 
    Elizabeth commits suicide over the guilt of killing her only 
    daughter, Herbert tries to find a way to bring his daughter back with 
    her soul, which involves him killing Eleanor over-and-over (usually 
    by shooting her in the head with a pistol), only to discover that 
    every time he &quot;kills&quot; her, she returns back to life on her 
    own, each time being quicker than the time before, but still without 
    her soul. Herbert decides to inject himself with his serum to see if 
    her can locate Eleanor's soul. He learns about &quot;The 
    Darkness&quot;, a Purgatory-like place that is nothing but blackness, 
    where people go between life and death, just before they are 
    &quot;judged&quot; being good or evil and whether they will go to 
    Heaven or Hell. Herbert manages to escape The Darkness and return to 
    Earth, but he is sure Eleanor's soul lives there. One day, Eleanor 
    escapes from her father and goes out into the world, becoming a 
    famous violinist in an orchestra, Now an adult, Eleanor (played by 
    Rita Rusciano) is not only a world-famous violinist, she is also a 
    remorseless serial killer (Remember, she has no soul), murdering 
    anyone who stands in her way, usually by garotting them. This is when 
    the film loses all forward motion and becomes a really confusing mess 
    of a film, as Herbert's son, Herbert West Jr. (Alessio Cherubini) 
    enters the film and he knows all about his Father's work, even though 
    Herbert Sr. is sure he never had a son! Just who is this man and why 
    has he created three re-animated bodies, keeping them locked in 
    Herbert Sr.'s house (and keeps Herbert Sr. chained to a wheelchair!)? 
    If you are looking for answers, you'll get none in this film, as it 
    turns into a hodge-podge of confusing (but eerily affecting and 
    atmospheric) scenes of grue and symbolism, especially the bathtub 
    that is a portal between the living and The Darkness (Herbert Jr. 
    makes his first appearance when Eleanor is pulled under the murky 
    black water in the bathtub and Herbert Jr. suddenly appears, trapping 
    Eleanor in The Darkness! Confused yet? Yeah, so was I!). I really 
    wanted to like this film because it is beautifully shot and edited 
    (Zuchon does have a flair with the camera),&nbsp; but I just couldn't 
    give it a positive review because, even though I am a huge Lovecraft 
    fan, the film makes absolutely no sense, especially the sudden 
    finale, which will having you scratching your head until there is 
    blood under your fingernails. Keep trying Zuchon, but only when you

    must battle computer dinosaurs in a virtual world. If you die in the 
    game, you die in real life and the winner of the game will get their 
    freedom. Taking place in the near future, this film details the 
    trials and tribulations of the Death Row inmates, while the game does 
    nothing but expoit their eventual deaths as &quot;entertainment&quot; 
    for the 300 million people watching the games on their TVs, 
    especially by the game's master of ceremonies, known simply as

    and the other a mohawk-wearing loudmouth (Kyle Penington); Stephanie

    &quot;red shirts&quot; (who die quickly, so we don't get to know 
    them) and of course, Tucker (Adam Hampton), the only innocent convict 
    in the group, who was convicted of murdering his wife while she 
    slept. The game is played in four steps. the First Step is trying to 
    make it to a &quot;Safe Zone&quot; before they are attacked and 
    killed by raptors; the Second Step (and the most interesting) is 
    trying to make it through a maze, where the first one to do so is 
    given a laser rifle (It's Tucker, who refuses to shoot anyone, 
    because he is innocent); The Third Step is to make it through a mine 
    field without being blown to pieces while being attacked in the air 
    by pterodactyls (One convict is picked up by one of the flying 
    lizards and dropped on a mine!); and the Fourth Step is reserved for 
    the final two contestants, where they are chained together by a long 
    chain in the desert and must find the key to unlock the padlock (it's 
    somewhere buried in the sand) before they are eaten by approaching 
    Tyrannosaurus-Rex's. It's Tucker and Joy who are chained together and 
    in a &quot;surprise twist&quot; everyone saw coming, it was Joy who 
    killed Tucker's wife and The Host knew it, but opponents to the game, 
    called the &quot;Cavemen&quot;, sabotage the finale and The Host is 
    dispatched rather fittingly, getting swallowed whole by a T-Rex. If I 
    make this film sound interesting, my apologies, as the CGI dinosaurs 
    are pitiful, as is an attack on Joy by a Sabertooth Tiger and Albert 
    getting attacked by a carnivorous plant, spraying acid all over him 
    as we watch him dissolve. There's nothing here that's the least 
    interesting except for Ryan Merriman's portrayal of The Host, a real 
    scumbag of a human being who orchestrates the killing of nearly 
    everyone, until the tables are turned by the game's Associate 
    Producer (Raychelle McDonald), who was made to interview Tucker's 
    kids and they believe their father is innocent of killing their 
    mother. She joins the &quot;Cavemen&quot;, who sabotage the game's 
    final minutes, resulting in the death of Joy, and Tucker, being the 
    winner of the game, is set free. Just so there is no doubt there will 
    be a sequel on the horizon, the film closes with the game's Producer, 
    Savannah (Perrey Reeves; <B><A HREF="childs_play_3_1991.htm">CHILD'S 
    PLAY 3</A></B> - 1991), announcing on TV that the game will continue 
    next year with a new &quot;upgrade&quot;, showing us dinosaurs fitted 
    with machine guns and rocket launchers! Director/producer Ryan 
    Bellgardt (<B><A HREF="army_of_frankensteins_2013.htm">ARMY OF FRANKENSTEINS</A></B> 
    - 2013), who wrote the anemic screenplay with Galen Christy, fails to 
    give any of the characters interesting backstories (except for 
    Tucker), resulting in the viewer not caring about any of them, so 
    when they are killed, all that it ellicits is a ho-hum by the 
    audience. It could have been a much better movie with more 
    professional CGI (it gets worse as the film progresses, like they ran 
    out of money for good CGI and just winged it on a computer) and a 
    better written story. You can watch this streaming for free on Amazon 
    Prime, or if you aren't a Prime member, you can watch it streaming 
    for free (with ads) on Tubi, no membership required. Just go into it 
    knowing that it's not a very good film and you may find yourself 
    enjoying it, just for its badness. All-in-all, it looks like a 
    typical original film on the Sy-Fi Network, so you will know if you 
    will enjoy it or not.;<A NAME="HallowAuntEthel2018"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B><A HREF="halloween_at_aunt_ethels_2018.htm">HALLOWEEN
     AT AUNT ETHEL'S</A></B> (2018) is a horror comedy that just doesn't 
    work, thanks to a loss of logic and common sense. The story is about 
    the title character, Aunt Ethel (portrayed shamelessly by &quot;Gail 
    Yost&quot;, who is actually the mother of the film's director), who, 
    every Halloween, kills children for reasons unknown and uses their 
    body parts as &quot;Pickled Chocolates&quot;, which she gives to 
    other children who knock on her door. Two teenage girls, the innocent 
    and pure Melissa (Madeleine Murphy) and the whorish Mandy (Stephanie 
    Town), along with Mandy's boyfriend Mark (Sean Michael Gloria), spy 
    on Aunt Ethel to catch her in the act of killing children for reasons 
    only known to Mandy and Mark, Melissa being kept out of the loop. It 
    turns out both Mandy and Mark lost brothers and sisters to Aunt Ethel 
    during Halloweens past and they plan on killing her. It turns out 
    that, years ago, Aunt <A HREF="halloween_at_aunt_ethels_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/halloween at aunt ethel's poster10a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Ethel
     was cursed by a witch, who made her immortal if she kills thirty-one 
    people (it doesn't have to be children) every Halloween. If she 
    doesn't,&nbsp; bad things will happen to her. I know it doesn't make 
    very much sense and that's where this film fails, badly, very badly. 
    For one thing: if everyone in town knows Aunt Ethel is killing 
    children, why aren't the police involved? We do not see any cops in 
    this film at all. It's only in the film to advance the plot, where 
    Melissa has to face-off with Aunt Ethel, Melissa being the 
    thirty-first victim, but Aunt Ethel gives her a way out of this. She 
    must kill the next child who knocks on the door, which she does, 
    stabbing a little boy in the stomach, without any emotion at all! 
    Aunt Ethel then laughs and says the curse is now on Melissa, as the 
    only way to break the curse is to have someone else willingly kill 
    the thirty-first victim! Now Melissa must kill thirty-one people 
    every Halloween or something &quot;bad&quot; will happen to her! 
    There, I have given away the entire plot of the film. You can thank 
    me now, readers.&nbsp; I will say this: The film is chock-full of 
    nudity, usually by Mandy, who is a slut of the first degree and also 
    uses people like toilet paper. Why anyone is friends with her is 
    beyond me. There's also a sub-plot about a serial peeping tom and 
    masturbater named Ricky (Chris Cavalier), who peeps into everyone's 
    windows and jerks-off. When he does it to Aunt Ethel (Why???), she 
    captures him and cuts off his dick with pruning shears and then slaps 
    him in the head with it. Aunt Ethel is a ridiculous character with a 
    blonde fright wig, who talks to all of her dead victims (she even 
    plays checkers with one of her dead female victims and then accuses 
    her of cheating, slugging her in the face!). All of this is played as 
    a broad farce, but director/producer/screenwriter Joseph Mazzaferro 
    hasn't the foggiest idea of what is funny, using gags older than time 
    itself, none of them working. Do yourself a favor and ignore this 
    film. I wish I did. It doesn't work as either a comedy or a horror 
    film; it's just a poorly scripted and acted piece of celluloid that 
    shouldn't have been released. The only good thing I can say about it 
    is that it is only 70 minutes long, with a nearly ten-minute 
    &quot;rap&quot; song added during the end credits, bringing its 
    running time to 80 minutes. Like the film itself, the song is neither 
    memorable or good, as it sounds like thousands of rap songs that came 
    before it, only with scenes of Aunt Ethel and the cast dancing to the 
    music and doing it badly. Christ, no one does anything good in this film!</FONT></FONT></P>

     WAKE</A><A NAME="BlackWake2018"></A></B> (2018) is one of those 
    films that you hope gets better as it progresses, but all it does is 
    let you down. The main problem with this film is its main actress, 
    Nana Gouvea (great body, terrible actress). Her Brazilian accent is 
    very hard to understand and that wouldn't normally be a problem for 
    me, but she narrates 90% of the film! The second problem is that this 
    is a &quot;found footage&quot; flick. And the third, and most 
    important, problem is that this film can't make up its mind what type 
    of film this wants to be. It starts out as a zombie film, then turns 
    into a<A HREF="black_wake_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/black wake poster16a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    &quot;Government covers-up strange murders all over the Eastern 
    Seaboard&quot; scenario and then turns into some H.P. Lovecraft-like 
    tentacled monster film. The film opens with two C.I.A. agents 
    (wearing Google Glass, or optical head-mounted display smart glasses) 
    doing secret surveillance on Dr. Luiza Moreira (Gouvea), watching her 
    as she jogs and swims in a pool (in a tiny bikini, so we can see she 
    has a fantastic body [and a tattoo just below her navel]). She then 
    goes to her new job at some government building, where she is 
    introduced to her boss, Dr. Vincent Jones (Vincent Pastore; <B><A HREF="sopranos_tv.htm">THE
     SOPRANOS</A></B> [1999 - 2007]). Luiza is put in charge of 
    researching a series of strange &quot;murders&quot; happening along 
    the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, where people are found 
    with huge holes in their heads, exposing their brains. The strangest 
    thing about these &quot;murders&quot; is that it was like the brains 
    exploded out of their heads, not like someone cracked their skulls 
    open. And none of the many victims had anything in common with each 
    other. They were found hundred of miles apart, but all died at the 
    same time and in the same way. The only thing these people had in 
    common is that they were all near bodies of water before they died. 
    The only police official who seems to notice the strangeness of these 
    murders is Sheriff Williams (Chuck Zito; <B><A HREF="oz_tv.htm">OZ</A></B> 
    [1998 - 2002]), as he tries to warn the public of the danger, but he 
    is quickly silenced by the government. The building Luiza works in is 
    covered with surveillance cameras, the government keeping an eye on 
    everyone 24/7, but Luiza uses to web camera on her laptop as a video 
    diary, as she collects evidence which seems to reveal the the deaths 
    are not murder at all, but unknown &quot;worm-like&quot; creatures 
    (they actually look like alien scorpions) that enter the human body 
    through any opening they can find and after a short while they 
    explode out of the person's head. Luisa gets her hands on a 
    &quot;book&quot; (actually a lot of paper attached together) that is 
    titled &quot;The Seas From Whence They Came&quot; that was written by 
    a homeless young man named Tommy (Jonny Beauchamp; <B><A HREF="penny-dreadful_tv_series_2014.htm">PENNY
     DREADFUL</A></B> [2014 - 2016]) and full of strange, hand-drawn 
    pictures. As a boy, Tommy was on a boat with his mother and father, 
    when something strange happened. His father was killed and his mother 
    disappeared and was never found. Luiza gets her hands on some 
    documentary footage, where two teens interview Tommy about 
    homelessness. Tommy gives one of the teens his &quot;book&quot; and 
    he give the other a plastic jug that contains black liquid and one of 
    the &quot;worms&quot;, which shoots out of the jug and into the 
    teen's mouth. The surviving teen, Lucas (Jeremy Fernandez), is 
    interviewed by Detective Michaels (Tom Sizemore; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BottomFeeder">BOTTOM
     FEEDER</A></B> - 2006) and when he asks the teen what this 
    &quot;book&quot; means, Lucas laughs, grabs an officer's pistol and 
    shoots himself in the head (Even I know that no guns are ever allowed 
    in an interview room, just because of something like <A HREF="black_wake_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/black wake poster18a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>this
     very incident!). Somehow, Luiza gets her hands on this 
    &quot;book&quot; (There are a lot of &quot;somehows&quot; in this 
    film, too many to keep track of) and becomes obsessed with it. She 
    now believes the &quot;murders&quot; are caused by unknown creatures 
    that may not be from this planet. She tells her supervisor, Dr. Frank 
    (Eric Roberts; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#SelfStorage 2013">SELF STORAGE</A></B> 
    - 2013), about the creatures, but he tells her to stick with the 
    facts and quit believing in science fiction. I've told you all you 
    need to know about this poor independent film, directed/co-written by 
    Jeremiah Kipp, who really hasn't done anything else of note except 
    for dozens of short films (Nana Gouvea was this film's Executive 
    Producer, which explains why she got the key female role). If you 
    notice all the &quot;stars&quot; in this film, know this: They are in 
    one or two scenes (Eric Roberts' scenes could have been shot in less 
    than 30 minutes) and then disappear. Vincent Pastore gets eaten by 
    two topless &quot;sea zombies&quot; in a morgue, Chuck Zito turns 
    into a zombie and eats two bank robbers in their hotel room and Eric 
    Roberts is killed offscreen, his death mentioned in passing by Luiza. 
    The only one to survive is Tom Sizemore, who looks like he is making 
    up his lines as his two scenes progress. Most of the film is Luiza 
    talking to her laptop camera, her dialogue very hard to understand (I 
    had to rewind the film several times to understand what she was 
    saying), but there is a &quot;surprise&quot; near the finale that 
    tells us why the two C.I.A. agents are keeping a close eye on her. 
    When Luiza goes home to her husband and teenage daughter after being 
    away for nearly half a year, she discovers they are not her husband 
    and daughter at all. Care to guess who she really is (It's mentioned 
    in this review)? If I have to say one good thing about this film, 
    it's that the CGI of the small creatures and the honking big 
    tentacled creature we see in the finale are very well done. Better 
    than this film deserves. It won countless <A HREF="black_wake_2018.htm#FestivalAwards">awards
     at film festivals</A> I never heard of (including one for Tom 
    Sizemore as &quot;Best Actor&quot;!), making me think of the films 
    this flick went up against to get those awards. Could they have been 
    as bad, or worse, than this one? I highly doubt it!;<A NAME="Clownado2018"></A> 
    Director Todd Sheets is one of the originators of the Shot-On-Video 
    (SOV) genre, churning out <A HREF="todd_sheets_films.htm">scores of 
    films since the mid-'80s</A>. What's amazing is that he is still 
    going strong some 35 years later. While most of Sheets' films are 
    nothing but extreme gore with a minimal of understandable plot, he 
    has tried to up his game lately with story-driven, gore-drenched 
    films such as <B><A HREF="house_of_forbidden_secrets_2013.htm">HOUSE 
    OF FORBIDDEN SECRETS</A></B> (2013; his tribute to Italian Gothic 
    horror films), <B><A HREF="ouija_death_trap_2014.htm">OUIJA DEATH TRAP</A></B>

    (2018) is a step backwards for Sheets. Just look at the title and it 
    tells you all you need to know. A group of crazy psychotic circus 
    clowns, led by Big Ronnie (John O'Hara) murder the boyfriend of 
    circus worker Savanna (Rachel Lagen), so she goes to<A HREF="clownado_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/clownado dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    witch Autumn Moonspell (former porn star Jeanne Silver) to cast a 
    deadly curse on Big Ronnie, who raped her after killing her 
    boyfriend. Something goes wrong with the ritual and Big Ronnie and 
    his clown mates are now able to travel by tornado and touch down 
    anywhere they want to, killing anyone in their way in various gory 
    manners, but it almost always ends up with their victims being 
    disemboweled or torn apart, revealing to us that they are full of 
    various red-colored jellies and jams.&nbsp; A truck driver named 
    Hunter Fidelis (Bobby Westrick) teams up with a stripper named Bambi 
    (Dilynn Fawn Harvey), a runaway daughter named Rachel (Sierra 
    Stodden) and a black Elvis impersonator named Dion (Sheets regular 
    Antwoine Steele) to try and find a way to stop these murderous clowns 
    before they wipe out the entire town. That's the entire plot to this 
    film. The rest of the 99-minute running time is filled with awful CGI 
    twister effects and plenty of gory physical effects, including the 
    previously mentioned disembowelments, appendages being ripped or cut 
    off, several decapitations, stabbings, shootings, and female clown 
    Satchel (Cayt Feinics) growing teeth on her breasts (like in the film <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Mausoleum1982">MAUSOLEUM</A></B> 
    - 1982) and a huge tongue popping out of an opening in her stomach, 
    where she chews off a man's head and swallows it through her stomach! 
    When Satchel is shotgunned in the chest and stomach, she gives birth 
    to a midget clown named Shrinky Dink (Jeffery White), who crawls out 
    of her stomach! While I won't call the effects good, they do fit 
    perfectly into the story, but when reality sets in with the viewer, 
    they will realize that this isn't a good film at all. Sheets manages 
    to raise money to make his films through crowdfunding and it's 
    apparent that there are many fans of his work out there, because he 
    always manages to raise his funding goals. While I don't care for 
    this film, I have to say I am a fan of Todd Sheets. I have had 
    conversations with him on Facebook and he seems to be an easy-going 
    person who loves the horror genre. He also usually hires actors way 
    past their prime to appear in his flicks (such as the late <A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_3.htm#DyanneThorne">Dyanne
     Thorne</A>), his favorite being Linnea Quigley, who appears here as stripclub/bar
     owner Spider, a character she originally played in <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Sorority Babes Bowl">SORORITY
     BABES IN THE SLIMEBALL BOWL-O-RAMA</A></B> (1987). She only appears 
    for about a minute in this film, but she registers in her role, if 
    only because the rest of the actors here can politely be called 
    amateurs (except for Jeanne Silver, who also registers in her role). 
    As long as Todd Sheets makes films, I'll watch them, because he is 
    truly an American icon in the field of SOV horror. No one in his 
    field has lasted longer (the closest anyone comes to him is Mark 
    Polonia, but his films, nearly all of them, stink on ice. <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#AmityDeathHouse14">AMITYVILLE
     DEATH HOUSE</A></B> [2014] anyone?). Todd Sheets has talent to 
    spare, but in the overcrowded genre of clown horror films, this is 
    not a good one. Watch <B><A HREF="#Terrifier2016">TERRIFIER</A></B>

    When I was a kid growing up in Wanaque, New Jersey (one of the 
    strangest towns in Northern New Jersey), the major ghost story all 
    kids would tell was about the ghostly happenings on Clinton Road, a 
    ten mile stretch of county road in nearby West Milford. As a matter 
    of fact, the first thing I did when I got my first car at the age of 
    sixteen was drive to Clinton Road (In the daytime, never at night. 
    I'm not stupid!) and see for myself if the tales were true. Nothing 
    happened, but there is no denying that it is a creepy stretch of 
    road, a thick row of trees on both sides and very little traffic. 
    There were tales of a ghostly female hitchhiker, a white phantom 
    truck that would follow you at night, a ghost child that would stand 
    in the middle of the road, coins on a bridge that would fall into the 
    water below by themselves (causing someone to drown) and other 
    ghostly happenings, all on that stretch of paved road. That is why I 
    decided to watch the horror film <B><A HREF="clinton_road_2018.htm">CLINTON
     ROAD</A></B> (2018) and after viewing it, all I can say is 
    &quot;Phew, did you smell that?&quot; When extended cameos by Ice-T 
    and Vincent Pastore are the best acting in a film, you know that is a 
    sign of trouble. The rest of the film is as threadbare and anemic as 
    a low-budget horror film can get. <A HREF="clinton_road_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/clinton road 2019 amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>The
     story, as it were, tells the tale of Michael (Ace Young), whose 
    wife, Jessica (Sarah Pribis), disappeared on that ghostly stretch of 
    road a year ago and was never found. To get some much-needed closure, 
    Jessica's sister, Isabella (Katie Morrison) hires a psychic named 
    Begory (James DeBello, in a wince-inducing performance) to travel to 
    Clinton Road and contact her sister to find out what happened to her. 
    She invites Michael and his current girlfriend Kayla (Lauren LaVera), 
    as well as Michael's best friend Tyler (Cody Christopher Calafiore) 
    to join her, Begory and Begory's stuck-up girlfriend Gianna (Erin 
    O'Brien) to go to Clinton Road and try to contact Jessica at the last 
    known location where she was seen. As you can probably guess, nothing 
    goes as planned, but these are the most unlikable people ever to 
    grace a movie screen. They also do the stupidest things imaginable, 
    all so the story can separate them from one another and they can be 
    killed off in various non-gory fashions. There's a ghostly little 
    girl with blacked-out eyes who screams (that's all she does!), a 
    ghost woman who walks silently through the woods, a ghostly park 
    ranger (played by Carlos Leon, the former beau of Madonna!), and a 
    bald-headed, thickly bearded hulk of a man with a sledgehammer who 
    looks like a member of ZZ Top, all who kill members of the cast in 
    their own ways (usually offscreen). Directors Steve Stanulis and 
    Richard Grieco (yes, that Richard Grieco; he portrays the driver of 
    the phantom truck in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo) toss in all 
    the ghostly tales of the area that I mentioned, but they don't even 
    try to explain them. They are just there. With no backstory, what's 
    the point? Toss in a non-ending that will make you want to kick-in 
    your TV screen, performances that can best be described as amateurish 
    and absolutely no blood or gore and you have a film that fails on 
    nearly every front, except for topless female nudity, of which there 
    os a lot (Probably inserted to get your mind off on how bad this film 
    really is. It didn't work). The film's best scenes comes in the 
    beginning, where Michael and the gang visit Ice-T and Vincent 
    Pastore's bar in NYC. Ice-T is a hoot, as he tells a story about his 
    experience on Clinton Road and scares the crap out of &quot;the white 
    boys&quot; when they are smoking pot in a back room. There are also 
    cameos by Eric Roberts (playing himself, although the female bouncer 
    doesn't believe he is who he says he is), Bo Dietl as the mayor of 
    New York (!), and Real Housewives of New Jersey's Dolores Catania 
    (who???) as herself. The end credits thank <A HREF="weird_nj_magazines_ &amp;_books.htm">Weird
     New Jersey</A>, one of my favorite publications and infinitely more 
    entertaining than this film (It even published a couple of my 
    stories). Personally, I can think of better ways to spend 77 minutes.

    (2018) is a terribly unfunny horror comedy, whose only saving grace 
    is plenty of female nudity and some good, gory, mostly physical 
    makeup effects. The biggest negative about this film is Tara Reid, 
    one of the worst actresses working today (she may be the worst 
    actress working today!). Thankfully, she's only in five minutes of 
    the film, but it's in the beginning, where I almost turned the film 
    off, thanks to her. She is one of the most unexpressive actresses I 
    ever saw. She only has one &quot;look&quot; and that is confusion. 
    After watching Reid running through the desert for five minutes, 
    while mummies try to attack her (!), the film then switches to the 
    main plot (And we never see Reid again. Hooray!). A party bus in Las 
    Vegas picks up its<A HREF="bus_party_to_hell_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/bus party to hell poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    passengers, who are all going to the Burning Man Festival in the 
    middle of the desert. An unscheduled passenger, Lara (Stefani Blake), 
    who gets out of a car after being propositioned by the old man 
    driver, hops on the bus when its driver, Joan (Sadie Katz), tells her 
    the ride is free. The passengers on the bus are your typical 
    clich&eacute;d lot. There's lesbian Ivy (Shelby McCullough), 
    bickering married couple Reese (ViDonna Michaels) and Warren (Ben 
    Stobber), nerd Stuart (Ray Gutierrez), intellectual Peter (Demetrios 
    Alex), ladies man Alan (Richard Hochman) and a bunch of other 
    passengers who are about to be slaughtered very soon. When the bus 
    breaks down in the middle of nowhere (and of course, there is no 
    cellphone service!), everyone gets out of the bus and are attacked by 
    a cult of cannibal Devil worshippers, who begin slaughtering all the 
    red shirts on the bus, by tearing their limbs off, beheading them, 
    cutting them in half and other bloody mayhem. Only the seven people I 
    mentioned survive, running into the bus and locking the door. It 
    turns out Joan, the bus driver, wasn't the bus driver at all (she's 
    dead in the luggage compartment), she's actually a member of the 
    cult. The cult wants Lara as their sacrifice, since she is a virgin 
    (of course she is!). Then the blood and bad comedy really hit the 
    fan. As the passengers are killed one-by-one, it is up to Peter to 
    have sex with Lara, so she's no longer a virgin. But, in the act of 
    sex, Lara turns into a horned demon and begins killing everyone else 
    (starting with Peter) until only Ivy and Reese survive. The film ends 
    with the promise of a sequel. Where do I begin? The humor is 
    extremely juvenile and unfunny, such as when lesbian Ivy tells Joan 
    that Lara can't be a virgin, because they just had sex in the bus's 
    bathroom. Joan then says &quot;I'm sorry. You don't have the required 
    equipment to take her virginity!&quot; When Joan swallows the keys to 
    the bus so no one can drive away (Why didn't the cult just disable 
    the bus?), Alan shoots Joan in the head with his pistol and Reese 
    cut's Joan's stomach open, feels around in her guts and retrieves the 
    keys, like it's nothing! All of Joan's tatoos (of snakes, spiders and 
    lizards) disappear from her body and become real, attacking everyone 
    still alive, but killing no one. I mean, what's the point?

    to get your mind off the ridiculous story and it almost works 
    (there's a surprising amount of lesbianism here, not just on the bus, 
    but in the cult, too). Almost. This is a threadbare 
    IndieGoGo-crowdfunded film that basically fails in what it attempts

    production (made for about $8,000) about four young girls who go to a 
    secluded cabin in the woods and encounter a cursed TV! Yes, you read 
    that right. This film is nothing but a mish-mash of film cliches, 
    where everything is way too dark to see. When one of the girls 
    destroys the TV, a man called Remington (Joshua Winch) appears and 
    tells them they opened up a big can of whupass and only he can stop 
    it, since he was the one who trapped the evil demons in the TV. 
    Before he can even begin to fight the evil, the film ends! Director/cinematographer/editor
     Michael Crum has made a film that he thinks is a tribute to <B><A HREF="evil_dead_1983.htm">THE

    copies elements from <B><A HREF="poltergeist_1982.htm">POLTERGEIST</A></B> 
    (1982) and other horror films from the '70s &amp; '80s, and does it 
    in horrible fashion, as it looks like the camera lens was coated with 
    a thick layer of vaseline, Crum trying to be arty, but it looks like 
    amateur hour. Some of the makeup effects are good, at least what I 
    could actually see, but you will find yourself squinting more than 
    looking, which is guaranteed to be a pain in the head. It's simply 
    awfully acted, shot, scored and sound recorded, looking and sounding 
    more like one of those '90s SOV flicks than an actual film. <B><A HREF="lake_fear_trilogy_2014-2018.htm#LakeFear2">LAKE

    a monstrous creature that begins killing them one-by-one. The most

    suffering! <B><A HREF="lake_fear_trilogy_2014-2018.htm#LakeFear3">LAKE
     FEAR 3</A></B> (2018) is a true sequel to the first film and I held 
    out some hope for it, based on the opening scene and some of the 
    creature makeup creations, if you can get past the jumbled opening 
    credits and dark photography. Michael Crum returns as director and 
    Joshua Winch returns as Remington. This one finds Remington being 
    followed by the evil released in the cabin's TV in Part 1. Wherever 
    he goes, death happens, as we see Remington walk into a bar in a 
    small Texas town, where a fat lady becomes possessed and falls to the 
    ground. An old drunk man, thinking that the woman has suffered a 
    heart attack, tries pounding on her chest and before you can say 
    &quot;John Carpenter's <B><A HREF="thing_1982.htm">THE THING</A></B> 
    (1982)&quot;, the fat lady's chest opens up and bites the arms off 
    the drunk man! The whole bar becomes possessed by evil, so Remington 
    exits as quickly as possible. Then the film begins its main story, 
    where we see Revel (Shanon Snedden), the sister of one of the 
    murdered girls in the first film, and her bored friend Chloe 
    (KateLynn E. Newberry), in the same small Texas town putting up 
    missing person flyers for Revel's sister. Revel then sees that 
    &quot;Ghost Hunter&quot; Vincent (Devi Khajishvili; whose English is 
    not quite up to snuff) is at the local movie theater signing 
    autographs for his latest movie (where no one will pay $5.00 for his 
    signed headshot!). Revel, not knowing that Vincent is a phony, asks 
    him to perform a seance to contact her missing sister, but Vincent 
    refuses when Revel tells him she can't pay him anything. When Revel 
    leaves the theater, Chloe tells Vincent she will pay him, knowing 
    that he is not a real paranormal investigator, just a very bad actor, 
    saying to tell Revel that her sister is dead, so she can get on with 
    her life. Vincent agrees and they all go to a restaurant, when 
    Remington enters. Oh, no! The restaurant's female owner threatens 
    Remington with a shotgun, telling him to get out of her place, she 
    heard about him from other local business owners that he brings death 
    and destruction everywhere he goes. To make a long story short, the 
    shotgun goes off and shoots Revel in the face. Revel then becomes 
    possessed by evil (good makeup, at least what I could see!) and rips 
    the head off the restaurant owner and begins chasing Chloe, Vincent 
    and Remington. The only way to stop the evil is to return to the 
    cabin, with a possessed Revel not far behind. If I make this sound <A HREF="lake_fear_trilogy_2014-2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/lake fear 3 amazon poster4b small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>interesting,
     I apologize, because this film is even darker to look at then the 
    first film, Michael Crum learning nothing about lighting between the 
    first film and this one. Nearly half the film is shot so darkly, you 
    can never make out what is going on. When this film was over, I had a 
    headache so bad from squinting so long that I had to take a couple of 
    valium to get rid of it! And, to even insult me further, the film has 
    a non-ending, setting us up for a Part 4, which, hopefully will never 
    get made because I will have to watch it for the sake of my readers 
    of this site. It's late-March 2020 as I write this review and there's 
    still no talk of another sequel, but it was four years between this 
    one and the first film, so I'm not holding out hope that it will 
    never get made. This film is like a cheapjack version of <B><A HREF="evil_dead_2_1987.htm">THE
     EVIL DEAD 2</A></B> (1987), but without that film's wit or camera 
    wizardry. Crum tries to inject some comedy into the proceedings 
    (screenplay written by his brother Gerald Crum), but both Devi 
    Khajishvili and Joshua Winch's line deliveries are rote. We can't 
    understand half of what Khajishvili is saying because his English is 
    really bad (He could really use an English translator and I would 
    advise turning on the English subtitles!) and Winch talks in 
    monotone, making both their characters uninteresting and boring. 
    There's also a lot of extremely slow motion shots between edits, like 
    Crum didn't have money for a second unit to film the B-roll needed 
    for exposition between scenes. I wanted to scream &quot;Get on with 
    it!&quot; after experiencing just a couple of these slow-motion 
    sequences, which go on for far too long. After watching all three 
    films back-to-back in one night and taking a couple of valium, I felt 
    spent and traumatized, like I was just tortured by the Spanish 
    Inquisition. I don't recommend any of you do the same thing, because 
    I am a professional (You can laugh now). The things I do for my 
    readers. All three films are available streaming on Amazon Prime (at 
    the time of this review), but I will not be responsible if you decide 
    to watch them. You have been warned!;<A NAME="HighMoon"></A>&nbsp; <B><A HREF="high_moon_2018.htm">HIGH
     MOON</A></B> (2018) was a werewolf film I was enjoying until a 
    hurried finale ruined that enjoyment. A hundred and fifty years ago, 
    gunslinger Colt (Chad Michael Collins; <B><A HREF="rock_monster_2008.htm">ROCK
     MONSTER</A></B> - 2008) kills bad guy/werewolf Willie Price (Tom 
    Zembrod; <A HREF="ticked_off_trannies_with_knives_2010.htm"><B>TICKED-OFF
     TRANNIES WITH KNIVES</B></A> - 2010) and his gang of werewolves in a 
    small Texas town by using a sceptor an Asian monk gave him. It seems 
    Willie and his gang murdered Colt's wife and family, so he killed 
    hundreds of werewolves looking for Willie, who was the &quot;Alpha 
    Werewolf&quot;. The sceptor can only kill the Alpha Werewolf, putting 
    an end to the werewolf menace once and for all. Colt buries Willie 
    and his gang in coffins he made himself, putting the sceptor in 
    Willie's coffin to make sure he never rises from the dead. If he only 
    knew about climate change! We are now in the present, as the small 
    Texas town, now known as Temple Wells, experiences a weird weather 
    anomaly, bringing Willie and his gangs' coffins, as well as Colt's, 
    to the surface, bringing them all back to life (WTF?!?). Willie 
    murders a local fisherman, which gains the attention of Sheriff Ethan 
    Hardy (Matthew Tompkins; <B><A HREF="bad_ass_2_bad_asses_2013.htm">BAD
     ASS 2: BAD ASSES</A></B> - 2013) and his deputies. Local physician 
    Doctor Reed (Ted Ferguson; <B><A HREF="dylan_dog_dead_of_night_2010.htm">DYLAN
     DOG: DEAD OF NIGHT</A></B> - 2010) has never seen a murder so 
    vicious, blaming the death on a wild animal. Colt, who is now a fish 
    out of water, makes friends with young beauty Lucy Andrews (Chelsea 
    Edmundson; <B><A HREF="daylights_end_2015.htm">DAYLIGHT'S END</A></B> 
    - 2015), a widow who lost her husband in the war in Iraq. She teaches 
    him all about modern machinery, including teaching him how to 
    &quot;ride a truck&quot;, while they try to stop Willie and his 
    revived gang of werewolves, who<A HREF="high_moon_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/high moon amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    have just murdered a gang of bikers and are now all riding Harleys! 
    Eventually, our heroes team up with a disbelieving Sheriff Hardy and 
    Doctor Reed to end the werewolf menace in his town, but it will mean 
    gaining the confidence of corrupt Mayor Bob Barlow (Sean Patrick 
    Flanery; <B><A HREF="#EvilWithin2016">THE EVIL WITHIN</A></B> - 
    2016), who is having an affair with the Sheriff's wife and smuggles 
    guns for a living. The finale takes place in Bob Barlow's house, but 
    it is a finale so rushed, you will want to kick your TV screen in, 
    because it is obvious that the ending was put there just so a sequel 
    could be made (it even says &quot;Colt Will Return&quot; at the end 
    of the closing credits!). Fuck them and a big &quot;Fuck You!&quot; 
    to director/screenwriter Josh Ridgway (Executive Producer of the 
    rather good horror film <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hayride2013">HAYRIDE</A></B> 
    - 2013), who supposedly had $22,000,000 to work with (I'm willing to 
    bet it was much lower), yet he couldn't give us a complete film. 
    While much of the film is very gory, it is obvious that some blood, 
    gun barrel blasts and bullet hits were computer generated. With a 
    budget like that, you would think they could afford the real thing, 
    physical effects and special effects done the old-fashioned way, but 
    no, the film cheaps-out on nearly everything, including the crappy 
    werewolf makeups. I was willing to overlook the werewolf gang 
    becoming professional motorcycle riders after just a few minutes on 
    the bikes and Colt driving a truck like he was doing it all his life 
    after just one short lesson from Lucy, but when the film promises a 
    showdown between Colt and Willie Price and doesn't deliver, that's 
    where I draw the line. I was going to put this film in the good 
    section until I experienced one of the most rushed endings in horror 
    film history. It turns ot Lucy has turned into a werewolf, kills 
    Willie with the sceptor and says, &quot;You're not the Alpha 
    Werewolf, I am!&quot;, runs away and then the film segues to a news 
    reporter on the radio, who says Sheriff Hardy and Doctor Reed are 
    dead, Mayor Bob Barlow is alive, but he rants incoherently and Lucy 
    Andrews is missing, when we see Colt steal a sports car, yells, 
    &quot;YeeHaw!&quot; and drives off into the sunset, setting the film 
    up for an eventual sequel. Fuck you movie (filmed as <B><A HREF="high_moon_2018.htm#Howlers">HOWLERS</A></B>)!
     If I want to be fucked up the ass, I'll hire someone, not watch this 
    film again or its sequel, if it ever gets made (I hope it doesn't). 
    Interesting concept, poorly executed, playing the viewers for 
    were-asses. Watch <B><A HREF="werewolves_on_wheels_1971.htm">WEREWOLVES

     <B><A HREF="pumpkins_2018.htm">PUMPKINS</A></B> (2018) is a 
    ridiculous horror flick from the U.K. that can be best described as 
    &quot;lazy&quot;. It's lazy in its storytelling, lazy in its killings 
    and lazy in its acting. The film begins with Shelly 
    (director/co-screenwriter Maria Lee Metheringham) injecting a green 
    liquid into pumpkins in a farm patch (We are never told what the 
    liquid is. Is it fertilizer? Growth hormone? <B><A HREF="reanimator_1985b.htm">RE-ANIMATOR</A></B> 
    serum?), while her crazy Uncle (Terry Wood, who passed away during 
    filming) yells to her to give the pumpkins the right amount of the 
    green liquid. Uncle is crazy because he loves his pumpkins; he even 
    talks to them while he eats dinner in the patch with them! Along come 
    two punk teenagers, who hate the Uncle because he is a land owner (To 
    be fair, one of the teens said the Uncle pointed a rifle at him when 
    he got too close to the pumpkin patch). They decide to teach him a 
    lesson, where, one night, they sneak into the pumpkin patch and draw 
    faces on some of the pumpkins, smashing the rest of them. When Uncle 
    gets up the next morning to feed the pumpkins their daily dose of 
    green liquid, he sees what the teens did to his pumpkins and has a 
    heart attack, spilling the green liquid on the pumpkins and himself, 
    dying in the pumpkin patch. Somehow, the green liquid brings Uncle 
    back to life, but it also put some pumpkin genes into his system and 
    now he has a pumpkin head (an obvious rubber Halloween mask, as we 
    never see any facial movement on it)! When&nbsp; the two teens wait 
    for Uncle to see what they did to his pumpkins, &quot;Pumpkin 
    Man&quot; (co-screenwriter Will Metheringham; as he is now called, 
    but <B><A HREF="pumpkinhead_1988.htm">PUMPKINHEAD</A></B> would be

     film was made for the change they found in their sofa!!) sneaks up 
    behind them and kills them (like all of the killings in this film, we 
    never see Pumpkin Man actually kill anyone, we only see the bodies 
    after the killing is done. Really lazy!). Hearing the screams, Shelly 
    grabs a big knife she keeps in her boot (!) and runs outside, coming 
    face-to-face with Pumpkin Man. Instead of being scared and running 
    away, she hands Pumpkin Man her knife and goes back inside (again, 
    really lazy). We then switch to two lovebirds camping out in the 
    woods and making out in a tent. When the man walks outside to take a 
    pee, Pumpkin man cuts off his head (offscreen, but I would have cut 
    off something else!) and dumps his headless body in front of the tent 
    for the woman to see (all we see is a headless body with no blood on 
    the stump!). Pumpkin Man then enters the tent and murders the lady 
    (by cutting her head off, which we also don't see). We then see a 
    group of five cliched campers on a weekend survival class in the same 
    neck of the woods. These campers are the least likely to survive 
    anything, because they don't listen to their two tour guides and two 
    of them end up lost in the woods by themselves. One of them, a 
    female, finds the tent with the two headless bodies (which we never 
    see) and runs to find help, while the other lost camper is killed by 
    Pumpkin Man (offscreen). The two tour guides eventually go looking 
    for the two lost campers, only to be killed by Pumpkin Man (offscreen 
    again). The last three remaining campers decide to make pumpkin soup 
    (!), so the male of the group begins carving a pumpkin, only for the 
    pumpkin to bite two of his finger off (again, offscreen, although we 
    see his two severed fingers on the ground). You see, not only is 
    Pumpkin Man alive, so are the pumpkins, although we never see any of 
    the pumpkins do anything violent, we are only told they are alive. 
    The one female camper who found the tent and headless bodies, makes 
    it to a pub, where she tells the &quot;Punters&quot; what happened, 
    but they don't believe her until Pumpkin Man shows up and begins 
    killing them one-by-one (offscreen). You know they are going to die, 
    because every one of them, just before they are murdered, see a 
    pumpkin on the ground (are these Pumpkin Man droppings?). Just like 
    the rest of the film, the finale is very weak and unbelievable, even 
    the stinger that comes after the end credits, making this film a 
    loser of the first degree. It's one of the laziest horror film I ever 
    saw (especially the axe one of the women holds, which is obviously 
    made of plastic or paper mach&eacute;!), but many &quot;critics&quot; 
    give it glowing reviews, saying it's the best '80s throwback slasher 
    film they ever saw. Please give me what they are smoking! The film is 
    horrendously acted (especially by the late Terry Wood as Uncle and 
    the camper who has his fingers bitten off) and sloppily paced, so I 
    fail to see how anyone could like this, but taste has no bounds. 
    Fortunately, I do, and this is probably the worst horror film of 
    2018. The only fun I had with this film is when the Punters were 
    singing along with a two-man band in the pub and adding their own 
    filthy lyrics to the end of every stanza. Thankfully, Pumpkin Man 
    doesn't talk or crack wise, probably because the cheap rubber mask 
    wouldn't allow it. If you are a slasher completist, it can be found 
    streaming on Amazon Prime. Just be aware that you have been warned.;</FONT></FONT></P>

     DTV Genre Films&nbsp; Part 28 (continued): <A NAME="Lease2018"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     I almost put <B><A HREF="lease_2018.htm">THE LEASE</A></B> (2018) in 
    the Good Category, but the truth is, I knew how it was going to end 
    ten minutes into the film. It's one of the oldest horror/supernatural 
    film tropes out there: the car crash. If a film begins with a car 
    crash and everyone survives, the film is probably going to end with 
    that they are really dead and don't know it. It's one of the oldest 
    tricks in the books, but this film has a couple of things in its 
    favor, but it is just not enough for me to give it a recommendation. 
    It's an Italy/Philippines co-production and it is filmed very well; 
    the cinematography is lush and colorful and the acting is pretty good 
    for a low-budget production. The film opens in Venice, Italy, where 
    husband Romano (Ruben Maria Soriquez) is hired to head a big project 
    in the Philippines, so he moves his family, including Filipino wife 
    Clara (Garie Concepcion), pre-teen son Anton (Harvey Almoneda) and 
    young daughter Althea (Jill Demski) to the Philippines in a huge 
    villa he rented for two years. Yes, the villa is haunted by a dark 
    past, and the viewer gets small clues as the film progresses. There 
    are some good jump scares here, such as Romano looking at his 
    reflection in a<A HREF="lease_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/lease 2018 amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    stainless steel pot and seing a whole different man; Anton looking at 
    a clown drawing on his wall (Clara is deathly afraid of clowns) that 
    has his back to him and when he tells the clown to turn around and 
    look at him, and it does (!); Clara taking a photo of herself by a 
    Christmas tree&nbsp; and the image turns out to be that of a 
    different woman; Anton and Althea try to go swimming in the villa's 
    pool, only to see two bloody bodies float to the surface; and Althea 
    going all <B><A HREF="poltergeist_1982.htm">POLTERGEIST</A></B> 
    (1982) on the TV set, where an evil clown on screen tries to pull her 
    into the TV set after she sees a balloon that reads &quot;I Love To 
    Kill You&quot;. If I told you that the family got into a car accident 
    just before they arrived at the villa, would that clue you in to what 
    is actually going on? I thought so. Actually, even though I guessed 
    the ending early on, I did enjoy the film to some extent, but not 
    enough for me to recommend it to you. This film borrows cliches from 
    nearly every modern haunted house film, including Althea finding a 
    possessed doll named &quot;Jennifer&quot; that talks only to her; a 
    stringy black-haired girl ghost who hides under Althea's bed; four 
    shadow people who stare at Roberto and his family in bed; everyone 
    going to a medium and holding a seance to contact the ghosts who are 
    haunting the house (it ends badly), bloody footprints that appear on 
    the floor and the final reveal, where the car crash caused them to 
    take over the bodies of another married couple with two children who 
    were in the car ahead of them, which is why they always saw their 
    reflections as somebody else. In the end, Roberto and his family 
    release the bodies of the people they possessed and they all fly off 
    to heaven. Director Paolo Bertola, working with a screenplay written 
    by Nick Harvie Aquino, does give the film a sense of structure and 
    style, but it's just not enough to be a film you sit down to at night 
    and enjoy. It's too derivative for its own good. I do have to say I 
    was surprised to see expatriate actor Don Gordon Bell in a small role 
    (he was also the film's Still Photographer) and Jim Gaines (here 
    billed as &quot;James Gaines Jr.&quot;) was an Associate Director, 
    both of them appearing in dozens of Filipino war actioners during the 
    '80s that I review on this very site. I should also note that is 
    wasn't unusual to have Italy/Philippines co-productions, as many 
    Italian genre films were made there, including <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#LastHunter1980">THE
     LAST HUNTER</A></B> (1980); <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Raiders Of Atlantis">THE
     RAIDERS OF ATLANTIS</A></B> (1983), <B><A HREF="action.htm#CopGame1988">COP

     THE BEGINNING</A></B> (2007). It's nice to see that the tradition is 
    still alive, no matter how bad the films are.;<A NAME="MusicBox2018"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Speaking of Italian horror films, <B><A HREF="music_box_2018.htm">THE
     MUSIC BOX</A></B> (2018) won awards at many film festivals, mainly 
    for the acting talents of Rachel Daigh (well deserved, even if she 
    bears an uncanny likeness to Meryl Streep!) and the direction by 
    &quot;John Real&quot; (real name: Giovanni Marzagalli), but, at least 
    to me, it is nothing by rehashed supernatural cliches wrapped in a 
    nicely photographed package (cinematography also by John Real). After 
    watching a young girl being killed by a ghost girl after playing with 
    a music box (or an &quot;<B><A HREF="music_box_2018.htm#CarillonTitle">IL
     CARILLON</A></B>&quot;, the film's original title), we skip ahead a 
    few years and watch as Annabelle (Rachel Daigh) and very young girl 
    Sophie (Cearl Pepper) move into the house where the other girl was 
    killed. Annabelle is Sophie's Aunt; she was awarded custody after 
    Sophie's parents were killed in some sort of accident (the film fails 
    to tell us what it was). Ever since that day, Sophie hasn't said a 
    word and she's a real cunt with a capital &quot;C&quot; towards 
    Annabelle, who has no idea how to take care of a child (Annabelle was 
    estranged from her sister, Sophie's mother, right up until her 
    death). Sophie sees psychiatrist Dr. Loris (Antonio Lujak) regularly, 
    as he tries to snap her out of the psychological funk she is in, 
    hoping to get her to spaek again, but he's not very successful. While 
    Annabelle and Sophie are working in the garden, Sophie unearths a 
    buried wooden box with a strange symbol <A HREF="music_box_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/music box 2018 dvd front4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>carved
     on it. Annabelle takes it into the house and pries the box open. 
    Inside it is the music box, the same one we saw the murdered girl 
    playing with in the beginning of the film. Sophie grabs the music box 
    and becomes inseparable with it, even taking it to bed with her. 
    Annabelle starts to get worried, as she hears Sophie talking to 
    someone she cannot see. Dr. Loris, who communicates with Sophie 
    written word, Sophie answering his questions by writing responses on 
    a pad, is able to get out of her that she has an &quot;imaginary&quot;
     friend named Lania (Melissa Leone), who we know is the ghost girl, 
    but both Dr. Loris or Annabelle have no idea. It soon becomes obvious 
    to Dr. Loris that Lania is indeed real (he sees an image of her in 
    his videotaped sessions with Sophie), so he and Annabelle do some 
    research on the house (which has ugly gargoyle statues in nearly 
    every room in the house, as well as outside it). They learn that a 
    woman named Mrs. White, who lived in the house before Annabelle and 
    Sophie, was a medium who lost her daughter under mysterious 
    circumstances. Annabelle and Dr. Loris (who are now lovers!) contact 
    a local medium named Mrs. Nills (Fiona Whitelaw), who conducts a 
    seance (never a good thing) to contact Mrs. White and it doesn't go 
    very well (no surprise there). Mrs. Nills tells Annabelle to bury the 
    music box in the wooden box she found it in; the figure carved on the 
    box is a symbol of protection from the evil supernatural forces. 
    While Sophie is sleeping, Annabelle takes the music box and buries 
    it, but the following morning, Sophie has the music box in her 
    possession. Long story short, ghost girl Lania doesn't want to 
    possess Sophie, she wants to murder her and make Annabelle her 
    mother! That's what Lania wanted to do to Mrs. White, but she buried 
    the box before Lania could finish her dastardly plan. The spirit of 
    Mrs. White leads Annabelle to her hidden diary and inside it are 
    directions for keeping Lania at bay. Can Annabelle stop Lania from 
    killing Sophie and becoming a new ghost mother? What do you think? 
    While not a complete failure, this film relies more on jump scares 
    than real scares, which seems to be the going trend for supernatural 
    films lately. There's only so many times Lania can appear 
    unexpectedly (such as in Dr. Loris' office or in the house) before 
    the jump scares don't make you jump at all. It becomes old hat 
    (Screenplay by John Real and Adriana Marzagalli, his wife). I have to 
    give props to Rachel Daigh's acting, as she impresses as the Aunt who 
    has no idea how to take care of Sophie, yet she looks so much like 
    Meryl Streep, I found myself believing I was actually watching 
    Streep! And Cearl Pepper as Sophie also registers as a young girl who 
    is a total bitch to Annabelle. When Sophie decides to talk again, she 
    has a British accent so thick, it will take you aback (and reaching 
    for the subtitles. Thanks Amazon Prime!).&nbsp; Even though the film 
    is one clich&eacute; after the next, it moves along at a brisk pace 
    and I had no trouble watching it until the end. That's the best thing 
    I can say about the film. I wasn't watching the clock and I wasn't 
    bored, but the film still didn't impress me at all. I also see that 
    John Real is trying to become the next Italian horror director, as 
    his IMDb resum&eacute; is full of titles and TV series I never heard 
    of. Here's hoping he makes something worthwhile and scary. He has the 
    talent to do it, as long he doesn't keep falling back on cheap jump 
    scares. A valiant try, but a failure nonetheless. Filmed in English 
    (although it is obvious Antonio Lujak was dubbed by someone else) and 
    available streaming on Amazon Prime. If you are not a Prime member, 
    you can find it streaming for free on YouTube, on channel &quot;Movie Central&quot;.;<A NAME="MimesisNosferat2018"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;

     NOSFERATU</A></B> (2018; &quot;Mimesis&quot; means recreating 
    actions and events of something that have already happened). This 
    film does have some positive points, but the plotting and character 
    names brings the film down in the end. It starts off with a young boy 
    named Max (actor unknown), who is obsessed with the silent film <B><A HREF="nosferatu_1922.htm">NOSFERATU</A></B> 
    (1922), so much so that we see him shave off all his hair on his head 
    with a straight razor, spread white greasepaint all over his face and 
    head and put two front sharp teeth in his mouth, such as those actor 
    Max Shreck wore in the silent film. Max's mother (played by Kristy 
    Swanson [<B><A HREF="buffy_the_vampire_slayer_1992.htm">BUFFY THE 
    VAMPIRE SLAYER</A></B> - 1992] in a short cameo) is very worried 
    about her son, as all he does is sit in his bedroom and watch the 
    film (on an 8mm projector!). She talks to her ex-husband on the phone 
    and they agree to bring Max to a psychiatrist, but Max is having none 
    of that, and kills his mother by biting her on the neck with his fake 
    fangs and watching her bleed out. Ten years pass and we are at the 
    Harker Arts Academy (c'mon now!), where teacher Professor Frederick 
    Kinski (Joseph Scott Anthony; and double c'mon now!) is putting on a 
    multimedia stage play of Nosferatu. Student Tara Brewster (Julie 
    Kline) was hoping to get a better part in the play, but Professor 
    Kinski reminds her that she is here on a scholarship, her parents 
    couldn't afford the school without it and she should be happy that 
    she's an understudy to the main actress. (He's a creep).&nbsp; New 
    student Michael Morbius (Connor Alexander, who sports a rather big 
    scar on this right side of his chin that is never explained. During 
    times in the film, the scar switches sides!) wins the heart of Tara, 
    but her friends don't trust him. Someone in the academy is getting 
    directions from &quot;The Auteur&quot; (Lance Henriksen; [<B><A HREF="#Unwilling2017">THE
     UNWILLING</A></B> - 2017], who only appears on computer monitors in 
    what is an<A HREF="mimesis_nosferatu_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mimesis nosferatu amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    extended cameo, even though he credited as the featured top actor), 
    leading this person to kill the main actor and actress in this film, 
    which results in Michael and Tara getting the main roles. It doesn't 
    take much intelligence to deduce that Michael is this person (it is 
    revealed halfway into the film), who then hypnotizes Tara's friends 
    to believe he is their teacher and knows what is best for them. 
    Tara's friend Gerry (Jacob Pacek), who is gay and is developing 
    torture devices for the play, is taunted by the school bully, who is 
    a closeted gay, but when he almost gets caught coming on to Gerry, 
    another friend of the bully makes Gerry go down on a banana (!), 
    while being filmed doing so. The video is leaked to the academy and 
    the students relentlessly ridicule him. Michael tells Gerry he has a 
    plan to get back at the bully and Gerry goes along with it against 
    Tara's pleas not to. They drug the bully, tie him to a chair dressed 
    in women's clothes and film him. When everyone leaves the bully tied 
    to the chair, two of Michael's Nosferatu &quot;doubles&quot; (we see 
    them being &quot;created&quot;, by having their heads shaved and 
    their two front teeth removed with a hammer and chisel and replaced 
    with the sharp fangs, a scene that is very hard to watch) approach 
    the bully and kill him by slicing into his flesh with their sharp 
    fingernails and biting him all over his body with their fangs. Gerry 
    is now possessed by Michael and they kill the bully's friend with one 
    of Gerry's torture devices, a sharp spike that is driven into his 
    heart by turning gears with a handle. Gerry and Tara's friend Ben 
    (Derek Brandon) walks in on the killing, only to find himself a 
    victim of the Nosferatu doubles and Michael, while Gerry watches and 
    smiles. A subplot finds Duane (Allen Maldonado, who is also an 
    Executive Producer here), the only survivor from the first film, 
    playing private detective to find The Auteur, who was also 
    responsible for the carnage of the first film (that's news to me, 
    especially if you saw the first film!). He doesn't really come into 
    play until the finale of the film.&nbsp; When the multimedia play is 
    in previews for the school's staff, Michael and Professor Kinski 
    sacrifice Principal Dryer (Crystal Lucas-Perry) and a board member by 
    asking them to portray small roles in the play (The play is actually 
    the best part of this film), where they are killed on stage. This 
    leads to nearly everyone getting killed (the school's staff are 
    handcuffed to their seats while the Nosferatus, now including 
    Professor Kinski, slaughters them in various gory ways), as an 
    injured Duane and Tara watch a preview by The Auteur, as to what film 
    the next sequel to this mutimedia play will be about, something we 
    don't see. THE END. While extremely bloody and gory, the film's plot 
    leaves a lot to be desired and, frankly, it doesn't make much sense. 
    We never see the police investigate the murders, as the film just 
    jumps around from scene-to-scene, no connective tissue between them. 
    Lance Henriksen, whom I usually love, does his usual five minute 
    cameo for a paycheck, offering nothing to his character, something he 
    has been doing way too much of lately. The acting here is generally 
    good, but without any decent plot to go with it, or any character 
    development at all, it's hard to recommend this movie. The film, 
    which was finished in 2018, sports a 2020 copyright date in the end 
    credits (it was released streaming and on DVD-R in October 2020; I 
    saw it streaming on Amazon Prime), proving that some tinkering was 
    done to the film after it played in several film festivals. Whatever 
    tinkering was done, it did not improve this film at all. As a matter 
    of fact, some needed exposition was probably edited out of the film, 
    leaving some of the character's motivations unanswered (such as if 
    Michael is actually Max from the beginning of the film or why he has 
    that scar) and some important plot points up in the air (such as who 
    are the two Nosferatu doubles). All in all, this is a violent film 
    with no other redeeming factors besides some good acting and 
    better-than-normal makeup effects. If you are a fan of the first 
    film, you will probably like this one, too, but all others are warned 
    to stay away.</FONT></FONT></P>

     THE FOREST</A></B> (2019). Why do I keep doing this to myself? After 
    reading the synopsis for this film on Amazon Prime and deciding to 
    give it a watch, knowing full well that it was a &quot;found 
    footage&quot; film (a genre I despise, despite getting pulled-in by 
    every synopsis I read) and then discovering that the &quot;film&quot; 
    is a total waste of time, I decided that it was time to get a 
    lobotomy, because only braindead people could enjoy crap like this. 
    This shot-on-video disaster concerns three YouTubers who have their 
    own paranormal channel and hope to have the A&amp;E Network pick-up 
    their series and thus make it to the &quot;big time&quot;. They 
    decide to explore a haunted forest, where people, usually children, 
    end up missing and are never found, even though their parents can 
    hear them calling from the woods. The forest is also supposed to be 
    the home of a witch, who is said to be behind the string of 
    disappearances. The trio rent a cabin in the middle the forest and 
    weird things immediately begin to happen, like loud thumps being 
    heard, but it turns out to be the drunk son of the man who rented 
    then the cabin. The female of this trio, Amy (Kimberly Hough), who is 
    the girlfriend of member Nick (Aaron Sherry), is an epileptic and is 
    taking a new medication for her seizures (she has one as they are 
    driving to the cabin). Third member, Chase (John Michael McDonald) is 
    the &quot;handsome' member of the trio and therefore the camera's 
    main <A HREF="into_the_forest_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/into the forest 2019 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>focus.
     He tells them that A&amp;E picked up their series and what they are 
    now shooting will be the pilot, so they buy an expensive HD camera 
    and other goodies to make this entry look as professional as 
    possible. They bring a father of one of the missing children to a 
    section of the forest, hoping to catch his missing daughter call out 
    his name, but after hours being there with nothing happening, the 
    trio want to leave, but the father pulls out a gun and points it at 
    his head, saying he wants to join his daughter. Amy is able to talk 
    him down and they return to the cabin, but when Nick studies the 
    footage they shot that night, he hears children laughing on the 
    audio, something they all didn't hear when they were there. The trio 
    then decide to walk hours into the forest and set up camp, but Amy 
    realizes she didn't bring her pills with her, she left them at the 
    cabin (Really? C'mon now!). Rather than walking back to get the 
    pills, they decide to stay there and shoot their episode, based on 
    Chase's recommendation that A&amp;E would want them to. As you can 
    imagine, creepy things begin to happen, but we see none of it, as 
    Chase finally reveals that A&amp;E never signed a contract like he 
    said they did. Then the film &quot;ends&quot; at the 67 minute mark, 
    revealing or resolving nothing, after promising a surprise ending in 
    the synopsis! This shitstain of a film only gives us grade school 
    acting, jerky camerawork and nothing that could be considered 
    entertainment even in the minutest sense. The fact that it took two 
    directors, Brendan Rudnicki &amp; Josh Huffine (who also wrote the 
    idea-starved screenplay), to make this insulting piece of cinematic 
    sludge is quite frankly, astounding, as a dozen monkeys on 
    typewriters and behind the camera could make something much better 
    than this, even with their eyes closed (flinging their poop around 
    would even make it more entertaining!). If you think you are going to 
    catch a glimpse of the witch or any of the missing children, think 
    again, there's nothing here that is the least bit scary, just jerky 
    camera work that shows us nothing. Do yourself a favor and skip this, 
    the first film I have watched with a 2019 production date (believe 
    me, it won't be the last). Don't believe the positive reviews you 
    read on IMDb, because it is obvious they were written by people who 
    worked on the film. This stinks worse than a field full of cow manure 
    and that's being way too kind!; <B><A HREF="gags_the_clown_2019.htm">GAGS

    Carter), who, along with her cameraman Dale Russell (Wyatt Kuether), 
    look to scoop a rival female reporter and lift their news channel out 
    of last place. Some of the stories here are interesting (especially 
    the podcaster's), but the film is full of so many errors and cliches, 
    it is very hard to like the film, nevermind enjoy it. First, there is 
    Gags himself (herself?), a character so underwritten, it's hard to 
    grasp what the clown's intentions are. We see him murdering some 
    people in a parking garage in the film's opening minutes, but after 
    that, the clown is nothing but a figurehead, a character without a 
    reason for being scary at all. He has the the ability to appear (and 
    disappear) anywhere at will; has black balloons that pop and spill 
    some type of substance on people that make them gag (!) and turn them 
    into clowns (!!); circus music plays from out of the sky when he is 
    about to appear or disappear and it's even implied that he may be an 
    alien (!), but none of it is ever explained. The finale of the film, 
    where all the groups gather at an abandoned warehouse (Which reveals 
    the biggest mistake of all: Why would an abandoned warehouse of 
    fifteen years&nbsp; still have working security cameras?), where 
    inside is a circus big-top tent containing all of Gags' 
    victims-turned-clowns and everyone dies incoherently, is one of the 
    biggest letdowns of the film. Gags hands Heather a bunch of black 
    ballons, which turn into one big balloon that looks like her and it 
    explodes, killing her! I mean, WTF?!? It's only done so we can hear 
    her rival female reporter say something &quot;ironic&quot; and 
    &quot;funny&quot;. Well, in both cases, it's not. The film is 
    supposed to take place in a single (very long) night, so there's a 
    lot of dark scenes to watch here while squinting and while the 
    camerawork is not the usual shakey-cam stuff (utilizing dashcams on 
    police cars, street cameras and building security cameras, as well as 
    Dale's news camera,), it's still a found footage film, yet, we are 
    never told who found the footage! Much of the acting is amateurish, 
    especially by the teen group, the gore is nothing but throwing blood 
    against walls and cars, the editing is bad and the film just slags 
    along until the WTF finale. There's a reason why I hate most found 
    footage flicks and this one contains every reason why I do. This is 
    director/co-screenwriter Adam Krause's first feature film, based on 
    his 2016 short film of the same name, and I hope he has learned his 
    lesson here. Why do first-time filmmakers have to pick found footage 
    flicks as their first feature? Yes, they are cheap to make, but they 
    are also cheap to look at and have very little entertainment value. 
    Even though I saw this streaming for free on Amazon Prime, I still 
    felt that I was owed my time back from watching this piece of dreck. 
    So will you. I'm done with killer clown movies. You just can't beat <B><A HREF="#Terrifier2016">TERRIFIER</A></B> 
    (2016) when it comes to this genre.;<A NAME="Butcher2019"></A>&nbsp; <B><A HREF="butcher_2019.htm">THE
     BUTCHER</A></B> (2019) may be one of the most puerile and threadbare 
    horror films that I have laid eyes on in quite some time. Basically a 
    vanity project for director/producer/screenwritor/editor/star Michael 
    Moutsatsos, a man so unusual looking (I don't want to be mean by 
    calling him ugly, but his double chin is so prominent, it looks like 
    a small face is trying escape from his real face!), you'll do 
    constant double-takes. Moutsatsos plays Thaddeus Hyatt, a famous chef 
    in 1995 Los Angeles who owns five <A HREF="butcher_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/butcher 2019 amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>restaurants.
     He also has Mad Cow Disease and is a serial killer, kidnapping 
    foreign tourists, injecting them with his blood and then butchering 
    them, serving their flesh to unsuspecting diners at his restaurants, 
    infecting them all with Mad Cow. Helping him in his endeavors are Mr. 
    Cremator (Noel Jason Scott) and &quot;Slayer&quot; (Sam Mason), who 
    torture the tourists that Thaddeus captures, before slaughtering them 
    for their meat. Some of the tortures include: using&nbsp; a portable 
    drill to bore holes in a man's head; using an electric knife to slice 
    up a woman's torso and other implements used by butchers, while we 
    watch stock footage of real butchers cutting up and preparing various 
    meats. That's basically the entire plot. While the tortures are 
    sickening to watch, we really don't see anything truly gory, as if 
    Moutsatsos didn't have a budget for any type of physical effects. 
    There's lots of blood to be seen, but it's always after the murders 
    are committed. Also headache-inducing are the amped-up sound effects 
    used whenever someone is hit over the head or beaten. The sound 
    recording on this film is pretty poor, because a lot of it was shot 
    using an iPhone 7, giving the film a very cheap digital feel and 
    there was apparently no time or budget to fix the sound in ADR. 
    Moutsatsos plays Thaddeus as a normal human being with a very normal 
    voice, who is taunted by his dead mother, Beatrice (Maria Olsen), who 
    appears as a decaying corpse several times in the film (the only use 
    of practical effects in the film). How Thaddeus caught Mad Cow and 
    why he hates foreign tourists is never explained, as the film is 
    underwritten, edited with a trowel, photographed haphazardly (like a 
    Found footage film) and sounds like it was sound recorded using two 
    tin cans and a piece of string, so, of course, this won several 
    awards at film festivals I never heard of. Films this bad aren't 
    made, they escape and the viewer suffers for it. Do yourself a favor 
    and avoid this 75-minute &quot;film&quot; like you would Mad Cow 
    Disease. It's a jumbled mess that offers nothing in the way of 
    entertainment, just shot after shot of people screaming (or puking 
    their guts out). My Aunt Minnie has home movies that are more 
    entertaining than this (like her trip to the world's biggest elastic 
    band ball in Kentucky!). Moutsatsos is threatening us with a sequel 
    to be released sometime in 2021. If you must watch this, it's 
    available streaming on Amazon Prime (At the time of this review).;<A NAME="NightSitter2019"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     I applaud the makers of <B><A HREF="night_sitter_2019.htm">THE NIGHT SITTER</A></B> 
    (2019) for trying to make a film that's a tribute to Dario Argento's <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Suspiria1977">SUSPIRIA</A></B> 
    (1977), but that was already done in 2018, in the excellent 
    &quot;reimagining&quot; of <B><A HREF="#Suspiria2018">SUSPIRIA</A></B>.
     This film has the look and feel of an Argento film, as it is bathed 
    in bright neon colors, but the story falls apart long before the film 
    ends, proving that<A HREF="night_sitter_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/night sitter amazon poster4b small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="1" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    excellent art direction and lighting aren't necessarily the elements 
    needed to make a good film. Far from it, the story is the most 
    important piece of the filmic pie and, in this film, that's where it 
    falls apart, as there are too many convenient coincidences and bland 
    plot ingredients to make the story palatable. The story is rather 
    simple. Strange father Ted Hooper (Joe Walz), who is filthy rich and 
    hopes to make the big time as a paranormal investigator, hires Amber 
    (Elyse Dufour) to babysit his young son Kevin (Jack Champion) and his 
    girlfriend Charlotte's (Deanna Meske) son Ronnie (Bailey Campbell) so 
    they can have a date night. He takes Amber on a tour of his mansion, 
    pointing to a locked door to his office, which he says is off-limits 
    to everyone except him, as he has many valuable supernatural 
    artifacts in there from his paranormal investigations. What Ted 
    doesn't know is Amber is a thief and she plans to rob Ted blind. When 
    Ted And Charlotte leave on their date, Amber phones her cohort in 
    crime, Rod (Jermaine Rivers), and tells him to bring a truck over to 
    the house, they hit the mother lode. While waiting for Rod to arrive, 
    Amber must deal with the rambunctious Ronnie, who wants to find the 
    key to Ted's office door so he can do some exploring. Amber and Kevin 
    become quick friends because she doesn't treat Kevin as as a child; 
    she talks to him like she would to an adult (which is refreshing for 
    a change).&nbsp; Ronnie finds the key and he and Kevin enter Ted's 
    office, which is full of strange supernatural artifacts (I will give 
    the film this, the office is very impressive and full of trinkets 
    that horror film lovers will recognize from other films). Kevin is 
    drawn to a book on his father's desk, which is titled &quot;The Three 
    Mothers&quot; (that's right) and he cuts his finger on one of the 
    pages, causing his blood to drip on the page, which is instantly 
    absorbed, bringing the Three Witches to life and looking for 
    sacrifices. They grab Ronnie, while Amber greets Rod outside, 
    surprised to see that he brought ditzy girlfriend Lindsey (Amber 
    Neukum, who is easy on the eyes) with him. Amber also has to deal 
    with the arrival of Martin (J. Benedict Larmore), a nerdy guy who 
    wants desperately to be Amber's boyfriend, but she wants nothing to 
    do with him. Not only that, but nosey neighbor Vincent (Ben Barlow), 
    who lives in his parent's garage, is watching every move Amber makes 
    and pays unexpected visits every now and then (He will prove to be 
    important to the film later on). Things get nasty when Kevin sees the 
    Three Witches hang Ronnie by his feet and slit his throat while 
    chanting. They also possess Lindsey, who tries to kill everyone she 
    meets. Martin gets his head beaten in with a dumbell (a perfect 
    weapon to use against him since he's as bright as a three watt 
    lightbulb) until it's nothing but a bloody pulp. Amber then kills 
    Lindsey by plunging a butcher knife into the back of her head until 
    the blade exits out of her mouth (perhaps a little tribute to Lucio 
    Fulci's <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HouseByCemetery1981">HOUSE BY 
    THE CEMETERY</A></B> [1981]?). It is then that the film falls apart 
    in such a dramatic fashion, you'll be hitting your head against a 
    wall in disgust. When Ted and Charlotte come home, Ted is pleased to 
    see everything is turning out just the way he thought it would. You 
    see, he knew that Ronnie would find the key to his office and open it 
    (Ted gave Ronnie a clue to where the key was hidden by telling him 
    &quot;X marks the spot&quot; before he left on his date) , releasing 
    the Three Witches into this realm. He hopes to film the events and 
    become the world's greatest paranormal investigator, proving that the 
    supernatural is, indeed, real! This leaves so many open questions, 
    such as: How did Ted know that Kevin would cut his finger on the 
    book, which is actually how the Three <A HREF="night_sitter_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/night sitter poster4b small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="209" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>Witches
     were released? As well as all the unanswered questions you will have 
    swirling around in your head, toss in a non-ending, leaving the film 
    wide open for a sequel (For Christ's sake, I hate this ploy because 
    it gives the film an unfinished look. When are filmmakers today going 
    to learn to give their films a proper ending? It's not that hard! 
    Sequels can still happen if a film has an actual finale. Just look at 
    the horror films of the '80s as proof!). On the plus side, 
    directors/screenwriters Abiel Bruhn &amp; John Rocco toss-in some 
    nice neon lighting, giving each room in the mansion its own primary 
    color and the acting by the cast is better than this film deserves, 
    especially by Elyse Dufour and the young Jack Champion, who really 
    connect with the audience.&nbsp; When Kevin is hiding under the bed 
    in his father's room while playing a game of Hide &amp; Seek, he sees 
    Amber steal a wad of cash from his father's night table drawer. When 
    he confronts her about it, Amber doesn't lie to him, explaining that 
    his father is rich and she is poor, telling him it's like the story 
    of Robin Hood. Kevin knows she is trying to soften the blow for him, 
    he appreciates it and they then form a real connection that is 
    palpable. On the negative side is the story, which is nothing but a 
    series of bloody events, the gory killing nothing but an end to a 
    means to get your mind off how random everything is. When Ted appears 
    and says he expected all this to happen, you'll want to punch him in 
    the face, as he doesn't care in the least for his girlfriend's son 
    and he seems to care less about his own son; all he wants is fame for 
    the footage he is filming. But he'll never be able to get credit for 
    it as the Three Witches kill him almost immediately as he steps 
    through the door. All in all, this is not a terrible film, not even a 
    bad one when compared to the other films in this section. It's just 
    an infuriating one, where they want you to ignore the plot and just 
    go along for the ride. I couldn't do that, especially when they have 
    the nerve to try to copy Dario Argento. Many have tried and many have 
    failed, including the two directors here, for there is only one 
    Argento. A good try, but still a failure.</FONT></FONT></P>

     I was expecting a lot from <B><A HREF="curse_of_la_llorona_2019.htm">THE
     CURSE OF LA LLORONA</A></B> (2019), but came away bitterly 
    disappointed, as the film is nothing but a bunch of jump scares and 
    very little else. This film is predictable from the very beginning, 
    something a horror film should never be. I knew everything that was 
    going to happen later in the film thanks to a cliched plot. As 
    someone who subscribes to many YouTube paranormal channels, I knew 
    all about La Llorona, the &quot;Crying (0r 'Weeping') Woman&quot;, 
    who killed her children by drowning them to teach her husband a 
    lesson when she learned he was having an affair with another woman. 
    After realizing what she did, La Llorona killed herself in the very 
    same river where she murdered her children and now she roams the 
    Earth looking for her children, crying loudly and&nbsp; stealing 
    other children, killing them when she discovers they aren't hers. 
    Legend has it that whenever someone catches sight of La Llorona, they 
    will die very shortly. The movie opens with La Llorona (Marisol 
    Ramirez; <B><A HREF="right_at_your_door_2006.htm">RIGHT AT YOUR DOOR</A></B> 
    - 2006) killing her children sometime in the late 1600s and then we 
    are in 1973 Los Angeles, where widowed Child Services social worker 
    Anna (Linda Cardellini; <B><A HREF="scooby_doo_2002.htm">SCOOBY-DOO</A></B> 
    - 2002) is assigned to check up on Patricia Alvarez (Patricia 
    Velasquez; <B><A HREF="mummy_1999.htm">THE MUMMY</A></B> - 1999) and 
    her two young boys, who are getting into fights at school. Anna has 
    dealt with Patricia before and is assigned a police officer to go 
    along with her, &quot;just in case.&quot; When Anna arrives at 
    Patricia's apartment, she can see something is wrong and asks to come 
    inside. Patricia says Anna can come in, but not the police officer. 
    Inside Patricia's apartment there are hundreds of lit candles, but 
    Anna can't locate her boys, asking Patricia where they are, but 
    getting no answer. She then finds a closet door with a padlock on it 
    and asks Patricia for the key.<A HREF="curse_of_la_llorona_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/curse of la llorona poster14a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="169" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    Patricia goes crazy on Anna, telling her not to open the door. The 
    police officer arrests Patricia, and when Anna opens the closet door, 
    she finds the two young boys, scared out of their wits. Long story 
    short, the boys are taken away from Patricia and placed in a group 
    home. The first night they are there, La Llorona kills the two boys 
    by throwing them out of their window, falling to the pavement below. 
    Anna, whose husband, a police officer, was shot and killed a short 
    time ago, leaving her with two young children, Chris (Roman Christou) 
    and Samantha (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen), to love and support, gets a 
    phone call in the middle of the night from her cop friend Detective 
    Cooper (Sean Patrick Thomas; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Burrowers2008">THE
     BURROWERS</A></B> - 2008), telling her to come to the group home 
    immediately. Anna has no choice but to bring Chris and Samantha with 
    her, telling them to stay in the car while she talks to Detective 
    Cooper. Of course, kids being kids, Chris decides to spy on Mom 
    looking at the two boys' dead bodies, but he then hears a woman 
    crying and goes to investigate. La Llorona grabs Chris by the wrist, 
    her touch burning his arm, but he escapes and goes back to the car, 
    where La Llorona tries to open the car windows with her magic, 
    scaring the shit outta Chris and Samantha. When Mom comes back to the 
    car and sees how frightened her children are, she asks them what is 
    wrong. Not wanting to tell her that he left the car, Chris said it 
    was a bad nightmare he had when sleeping in the car. I guess we can 
    all see what's going to happen next. Anna and her children are next 
    on La Llorona's list of victims, but a priest, Father Perez (Tony 
    Amendola; playing the same character he did in <B><A HREF="annabelle_2014.htm">ANNABELLE</A></B> 
    - 2014), gives Anna the name of a former priest-turned-La Llorona 
    hunter, Rafael (Raymond Cruz; TV's <B><A HREF="major_crimes_tv_series_2012.htm">MAJOR
     CRIMES</A></B> [2012-2018]; the best thing about this third rate 
    film), to help her battle La Llorona. That's basically the whole film 
    in a nutshell, the rest of the film is nothing but jump scare after 
    jump scare, with no real horror to speak of. Father Perez also places 
    this film in <B><A HREF="conjuring_2013.htm">THE</A> <A HREF="conjuring_2_2016.htm">CONJURING</A></B> <A HREF="nun_2018.htm">uni</A><A HREF="annabelle_creation_2017.htm">verse</A>,
     by telling her about <A HREF="annabelle_comes_home_2019.htm">Annabelle</A> 
    (we see a brief shot of the doll and that's as far as the 
    &quot;universe&quot; goes!). I have to say I did laugh by Rafael's 
    comment after defeating La Llorona in the finale, but I know you will 
    want to watch this film for yourself, so I'll let you discover what 
    it is. The special visual effects in this film are pretty rote (just 
    look at the &quot;steam&quot; that comes off a coffee cup and the 
    &quot;umbrella&quot; scene) and director Michael Chaves (his first 
    feature film) ladles on clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, thanks 
    to&nbsp; Mikki Daughtry &amp; Tobias Iaconis' uninspired screenplay, 
    until you will be looking at your watch, waiting for it to end. When 
    it does, you'll see that it is left wide-open for a sequel, just like 
    all the films in this &quot;universe&quot; and since it was made on a 
    nine million dollar budget and grossed $122 million around the world, 
    I think it will happen, don't you? Some of you may like this film 
    more than I did, but it could have been so much better than it turned 
    out. You don't need a crystal ball to predict every chich&eacute;d 
    plot point that happens in this film, like Anna being investigated 
    for child abuse when Chris and Samantha have the same burn marks on 
    their arms. I knew that was going to happen as soon as La Llorona 
    grabbed Chris' wrist. Even though this film is Rated R, it's a very 
    soft-R, as the violence is rather restrained, when it should be gory 
    and bloody. This isn't much of a horror film; the Mexican film 
    industry has been making La Llorona films since the early-1930s and 
    nearly all of them are better than this (Check out <B><A HREF="curse_of_the_crying_woman_1961.htm">CURSE
     OF THE CRYING WOMAN</A></B> - 1961). This isn't the worst horror 
    film I have ever seen, but it's still bad enough to be put in this category.;<A NAME="ItsyBitsy2019"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     I almost put <B><A HREF="itsy_bitsy_2019.htm">ITSY BITSY</A></B> 
    (2019) in the good category due to the excellent acting, but the 
    story dragged on-and-on until all I could do is look at the clock, 
    waiting for it to end. I should also admit that I have a deadly fear 
    of spiders, not the large furry ones (I would let them crawl on me 
    without flinching), but the small, tiny ones. My fear started in the 
    mid-1980s when I was bitten by a small spider on the inside of my 
    elbow while sleeping, my automatic reflex swatting and killing said 
    spider (it's how I knew I was bitten by a spider). Within just a few 
    hours, the bite swelled to the size of a grapefruit, which resulted 
    in me not being able to bend my left arm (and it was painful like a 
    bitch!). I had to go to a doctor to have it drained, but within a day 
    or two it would swell up again. I finally had to go to a hospital 
    emergency room to have an operation, which was worse than the spider 
    bite, as I was unable to use my left arm at all for almost four 
    weeks. Ever since that day, whenever I see a small spider, my heart 
    races and I think back to the day I was bitten. It still goes on to 
    this day. Okay, enough personal drama, let's get to the film. It 
    opens with a tribe of South American natives sealing a thick web of 
    something into a &quot;Black Egg&quot;, which the tribe worships 
    (according to legend it contains the trapped soul of a Spider Queen). 
    Apparently, <A HREF="itsy_bitsy_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/itsy bitsy poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>some
     Indiana Jones-like characters steal the black egg which results in 
    one of them getting a blood-gushing wound on his leg, resulting in 
    another member shooting him in the head (offscreen). We then switch 
    to Kara Spencer (Elizabeth Roberts) driving her children, 13-year-old 
    Jesse (Arman Darbo) and very young Cambria (Chloe Perrin) from New 
    York City to an unnamed place in the country to be a full-time nurse 
    to Walter Clark (an excellent Bruce Davison; <B><A HREF="willard_1971.htm">WILLARD</A></B> 
    - 1971), a former tomb raider who suffers from multiple sclerosis. 
    Before Kara and her children arrive to live in a home next to 
    Walter's, Walter is visited by old, crooked business partner Ahkeeba 
    (Treva Etienne), who gives Walter the Black Egg and wants something 
    in return, but Walter says he doesn't believe in the Spider Queen of 
    South America and tells him to get out of his house. Long story 
    short, Ahkeeba sneaks back into the house while Kara is there, 
    smashes the Black Egg on the floor and releases the Spider Queen, 
    which bites Ahkeeba (offscreen) and sends him escaping the house, 
    driving away and crashing inhto a ditch, where he dies of the spider 
    bite. A rather large spider (the size of a small dog) is now on the 
    loose, but it keeps itself hidden from everyone else, laying eggs in 
    the attic of the home Kara and the kids now sleep in. It also turns 
    out Kara is a lousy mother; she's a pill-popping drug addict who got 
    fired from her nursing job in NYC for drugging it up. She also 
    depends (too much) on Jesse taking care of his young sister, thereby 
    taking away Jesse's childhood (Jesse acts more like a father to 
    Cambria than a brother). When Kara runs out of her pain pills, she 
    takes to stealing pills from Walter's medicine cabinet, but he 
    catches her and tells her to get out of his house (Walter is able to 
    figure out that Kara is a drug addict and not much of a mother to her 
    children just by the power of observation). When Jesse hears his 
    mother talking to Walter over a baby monitor (it is a way for Kara 
    and Walter to talk to each other when he needs help), saying that 
    having kids to take care of is a drag (really???) and takes up far 
    too much of her time, Jesse smashes the baby monitor. It turns out 
    this is the night that Walter will need it, as the spider bites a 
    chunk out of Walter's foot and then rips out both of his eyes (all 
    offscreen). I have to admit that once Bruce Davison died, I lost all 
    interest in the film because I knew exactly how it would end and I 
    was 100% right. It's far too predictable. That's right, Kara becomes 
    a good mother by protecting her children and fighting the spider with 
    her bare hands, ripping its mandibles off and throwing it to the 
    floor, dead. The film ends with a drug-free Kara and the kids leaving 
    for points unknown, but at least they are happy. Stay tuned after the 
    end credits are done for a final stinger that goes nowhere, but sets 
    the film up for a sequel. More a family drama than a horror film, 
    there are some good practical effects but the spider attacks take 
    forever to come to the screen and when they do, all the kills are 
    offscreen. It is better acted than most genre films and both Bruce 
    Davison and Arman Darbo are excellent in their roles. There's a 
    subplot about Kara losing another child named Stevie in a car 
    accident when she was high on pain pills, but it goes nowhere; it's 
    only there to bring a tear to viewer's eyes during the finale (but it 
    fails). Denise Crosby (<B><A HREF="mortuary_2005.htm">MORTUARY</A></B> 
    - 2005) also appears as the town Sheriff, but it's a wasted role that 
    amounts to nothing. Freshman feature film 
    director/producer/co-screenwriter Micah Gallo (who is usually a [what 
    else?] visual effects technician on films such as <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hatchet2007">HATCHET</A></B> 
    [2007], <B><A HREF="under_the_bed_2012.htm">UNDER THE BED</A></B> 
    [2012] and this film) spends far too much time on the family drama 
    and far too little time on the horror, especially when it comes to 
    the kills, which are all offscreen. He does show some talent when it 
    comes to camera placement (Check out the before-and-after scene of 
    Kara in Walter's bathroom, which is shot from above), but a couple of well-photographed
     scenes don't make for a good horror film. It's not a terrible film, 
    just an ordinary one and that's enough for me to put it in this 
    category. Others may disagree and I understand why, but this was just 
    not enough for me.;<A NAME="CandyCorn2019"></A> I don't mind horror 
    films taking place during Halloween because, hell, it's the perfect 
    setting for a horror flick (John Carpenter proved that way back in 
    1978). What I do mind is a horror film that advertises itself as a 
    new Halloween tradition; a film that will replace all the other films 
    you traditionally watch during the end of October. One such recent 
    film is <B><A HREF="candy_corn_2019.htm">CANDY CORN</A></B> (2019), a 
    film with a great cast and a very lackluster story; one that you have 
    seen done a thousand times and done a hundred times better. In a 
    sleepy little Ohio town during Halloween, a quartet of overage 
    teenagers decide to pull a prank on retarded teen Jacob Atkins (Nate 
    Chaney), by pantsing him at a traveling carnival that has stopped in 
    town. What these teens don't know is that diminutive leader of the 
    carnival and the main freakshow attraction, &quot;Dr. Death&quot;, 
    a.k.a. Lester (a very good Pancho Moler; Rob Zombie's <B><A HREF="#ThreeFromHell2019">3
     FROM HELL</A></B> - 2019) has hired Jacob and accepts him as 
    &quot;one of their own&quot;. When the four punks confront Jacob at 
    the carnival, he fights back, which causes the foursome to pummel 
    Jacob relentlessly, killing him. After the punks run away, Lester 
    tells his workers<A HREF="candy_corn_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/candy corn 2019 poster4b small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="137" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>

     He is also an Executive Producer here and is wasted in a nothing 
    role) to put Jacob's dead body in his trailer, where he performs a 
    voodoo ritual over Jacob's body, returning him to life as a rotting 
    corpse (It makes no sense that Jacob's face should decay so fast (it 
    looks like a rubber mask), as his hands and the rest of his exposed 
    body looks normal!). Jacob then begins killing the quartet of punks 
    who killed him in various bloody ways and finishes with stuffing an 
    enormous amount of candy corn (Jacob's favorite food) down their 
    throats. One of the punks happens to be the son of Sheriff Sam 
    Bramford (a nearly unrecognizable Courtney Gains, who is no stranger 
    to corn, starring in the original <B><A HREF="children_of_the_corn_1984.htm">CHILDREN
     OF THE CORN</A></B> [1984] as &quot;Malachi&quot;, his first film 
    role),&nbsp; who patrols this sleepy little town without even 
    carrying a gun, because &quot;nothing ever happens here.&quot; He's 
    in for a big surprise, as the gruesome murders are discovered&nbsp; 
    and his deputies can't handle all the blood and gore on view. Sam 
    tries to talk to Lester, but the dwarf has a major distrust of the 
    police and talks to Sam as if he were the enemy, taunting him. As you 
    can guess, Jacob saves Sam's son for his last victim, but can Sam 
    stop him? The answer is no, as Sam's head ends up as a hood ornament 
    on his cop car and Jacob rips off his son's arms before killing him. 
    That's the problem with this whole film; there's no one to root for, 
    as nearly everyone ends up dead or are intolerable people (especially 
    Sam's son). The film also features P.J. Soles (<B><A HREF="halloween_1978.htm">HALLOWEEN</A></B> 
    - 1978) as Marcy Taylor, who works at the police station and has a 
    thing for Sam, but like everything in this film, it goes nowhere (She 
    is good, though). The violence is rather restrained for a film with 
    no rating, as most of it is seen after the fact or shown with 
    overamped sound effects (Listen to the scene where Jacob rips out one 
    punk's spinal cord). Director/screenwriter/editor/music composer Josh

    bit off a little too much than he could chew, as he forgot one major 
    ingredient for a horror film: the horror. It's not a badly-made film 
    and some of the acting is better than it deserves to be, but it's 
    still a bitter disappointment. It will not replace my #1 Halloween 
    horror film, <B><A HREF="phantasm_1979.htm">PHANTASM</A></B> (1979),

    (2019) is an annoying British slasher film with minimal slashing and 
    a lot of bad histrionics. Taking place in the real London Tombs scare 
    attraction located underneath the London Bridge tourist site, this 
    film has a bunch of minor celebrities gather to try and survive a 
    trip down to the Tombs. Yes, it's another reality show-based horror 
    flick under the guise of of a publicity stunt to advertise the sequel 
    to a fictitious film called The Tombs, which was very popular in the 
    U.K. The star of the first film and the&quot;final girl&quot;, Piper 
    (Jessica Ann Brownlie, the director's wife), is joined by five other 
    cliched people, including a psychic, a blogger, a spoiled starlet, a 
    claustrophobic man and a veteran reality show producer, to take a 
    tour through the scarehouse-type attraction, which is live streamed 
    on the Internet, the first one finding an important skull being the 
    &quot;winner&quot;. They don't know that blood from the cut hand of a 
    worker has brought back to life a hulking supernatural killer, who 
    looks like the Elephant Man carrying an axe. When the power goes out 
    and the live stream is no longer working, the killer begins 
    dispatching the celebrities, using his axe to do the dirty deed. 
    Unfortunately, we never see the kills, which makes this film a loser 
    of the first degree. What's a slasher film without the bloody kills? 
    If you want to know, then watch this film and learn how to never make 
    a slasher flick. The acting is generally one note and annoying and 
    the gore is practically non-existant, making this 79-minute film a 
    really long slog to get through. Directed by Dan Brownlie in 2014 and 
    then finished by crowdfunding in 2015, it wasn't released until 2019, 
    which gives you an idea how really bad this film is. There's not one 
    good thing in this film that I can recommend, nothing. Do yourself a 
    favor and skip this without hesitation. If you don't you will never 
    get those 79 minutes back. Believe me, you'll want to after watching 
    this dreck.;<A NAME="Tabernacle101-2019"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B><A HREF="tabernacle_101_2019.htm">TABERNACLE
     101 (2019)</A></B> held a lot of promise, but some really bad acting 
    and terrible writing do this Australian film in. Frank (David Hov), 
    an athiest, hosts his own Internet video blog show trying to prove 
    that there is no life after death (Saying all those YouTube 
    &quot;real&quot; paranormal videos are fake and only exist to gain 
    likes and subscriptions, which is something I believe) and that God 
    and The Devil are just figments of our imagination. He makes money by 
    interviewing mediums and fortune tellers and tearing them apart with 
    words alone. Now I would have done it much differently, looking for 
    wires and electronic devices that mediums use to get their clients to 
    beleive them. Frank just looks like a bully in my eyes. Frank's 
    latest target is medium and new-agey fortune teller Meredith (Mikaela 
    Franco), whom Frank tries to rip to pieces with his words, but 
    Meredith warns him what he is about to do will be very dangerous for 
    the world and somehow Frank gets nervous and leaves without telling 
    his cameraman, Daniel (Rees Laird). Frank's girlfriend and business 
    partner, Sarah (Elly Hiraani Clapin), a scientist, has found a way to 
    revive animals from the dead, first killing a guinea pig with a 
    lethal injection of drugs and then using a device she created to 
    bring it back to life an hour later. Frank gets the brilliant idea 
    that, in order to prove there is no life after death, Sarah is to do 
    it to him, killing him with a lethal injection and then bringing him 
    back to life sixty minutes later. Sarah is first against the idea, 
    but Frank convinces her if he does it live on their vlog, it will 
    generate millions of watchers, earning them a tidy sum. Frank, live 
    on camera, is then put to death by lethal injection, earning the vlog 
    over thirteen million viewers and when an hour passes, Sarah tries to 
    bring Frank back to life, but her efforts don't work, even when 
    applying electric shocks to his heart and a shot of Adrenalin 
    directly into his ticker. Thinking that Frank is now permanently 
    dead, he comes back to life in 63 minutes and when he wakes up, he 
    tells everyone that he saw nothing but blackness when he was dead, no 
    conscience, no dead relatives, no light at the<A HREF="tabernacle_101_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/tabernacle 101 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    end of the tunnel, nothing. That's not true at all, because when 
    Frank leaves the laboratory and views the footage with Daniel of him 
    coming back to life, there is a demon (Eddy Price) standing directly 
    behind Frank, someone no one saw in the laboratory. When Frank tries 
    to return to his normal life, he begins seeing demons all over the 
    place, especially the one that stood behind him and a female demon 
    (Victoria Ferrara) holding an upside down glowing neon red crucifix 
    (the sign of the Devil) trying to kidnap him. Long story short, Frank 
    now believes in life after death and joins forces with Meredith, who 
    tells him that he has gained supernatural powers, but when he was 
    dead, he opened a gateway for demons to come to Earth and overtake 
    our world, by using a computer virus (!!!) that will infect every 
    device capable of accessing the Internet!!!! To make matter worse, 
    Sarah has left Frank and has become lovers with Daniel, kicked him 
    off his vlog permanently by changing all the passwords and she is now 
    the new host of the vlog (there's a ridiculous scene later in the 
    film where Sarah and Daniel contact Frank online and makeout in in 
    front of him, Sarah telling Frank that Daniel is a much better lover 
    than he ever was. WHY???)!!!!!! Meredith teaches Frank how to master 
    his supernatural powers, such as disappearing and then appearing 
    somewhere else, the art of telekinesis and talking without speaking, 
    reading other people's minds. He must stay near Meredith to remain 
    safe, because the demons want to use Frank for their plan of world 
    domination to come to fruition. So what does Frank do? He leaves 
    Meredith at various times and becomes kidnapped by the demons, who 
    first put him in a cage and then tie him to an upside down crucifix 
    (it is all rather confusing). Frank is able to overcome the demons 
    with Meredith's help, but both Sarah and Meredith end up dead 
    (Meredith is tied to a stake and burned like a witch) by the demons. 
    The finale finds Frank joining forces with a dead Meredith to fight 
    demons everywhere. Maybe a sequel is in the works? Let's hope not! 
    Where do I begin? First off, director/producer/screenwriter/editor 
    Colm O'Murchu doesn't have an idea how to connect scenes together, as 
    one scene jumps to the next without any connective tissue, especially 
    when Frank is kidnapped by the demons. It is just one unexplainable 
    scene after another, the viewer having no clue what is happening. It 
    is also obvious that David Hov is not a good actor at all, as his 
    choices of emotions run counter-productive to the film, such as when 
    he leaves Meredith after she told him he will only be truly safe when 
    with her. So why does he leave her? To go get some booze!!!!!!!! Of 
    course, this could also be blamed on sloppy writing, but Hov is not 
    capable of showing the right emotions in every scene. It's like 
    &quot;Opposite Day&quot; with him. Also questionable is when Frank 
    learns to master his supernatural powers. So what does he do to test 
    them out? Why he goes out on the streets and does a David Blaine, 
    performing magic tricks for people on the street!!!!!!!!!!!!! This 
    could have been a good film about a non-religious man finding out 
    that he was wrong all his life, but the film manages to mangle it to 
    pieces with very awful results, such as the entire town of Sydney, 
    Australia falling victim to the internet virus and everyone passes 
    out. After Frank defeats the demons, all the people wake up and don't 
    even question what happened to them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hey, I'm an 
    Athiest and proud of it, but even I wouldn't mind seeing my beliefs 
    shattered in some mind-altering way in a good flick, but this isn't 
    it. This film is a cheezy exploitation flick that wanted to be more 
    (It makes the lousy <A HREF="flatliners_2017.htm">2017 remake</A> of <B><A HREF="flatliners_1990.htm">FLATLINERS</A></B> 
    [1990] look like a polished diamond, rather than the polished turd it 
    really is), but doesn't have the intestinal fortitude to carry it 
    out. Thanks, but I'll stick with my own beliefs.</FONT></FONT></P>

     I was never a fan of the <A HREF="pet_sematary_1989.htm">1989 original</A> 
    and 2019's <B><A HREF="pet_sematary_2019.htm">PET SEMATARY</A></B> is 
    no exception. It tries to mix things up with some extreme blood and 
    gore and gender reversals, but it all still rings rather hollow and 
    unexceptional, which is sad considering the talent in front of the 
    screen. We all know the story: ER doctor Louis Creed (Jason Clarke) 
    and his wife Rachel (Amy Seimetz) move to a house in Maine with their 
    two children, young daughter Ellie (Jet&eacute; Laurence) and even 
    younger son Gage (played by twins Hugo &amp; Lucas Lavoie, who look 
    almost identical to the original's Miko Hughes, so much so that it 
    couldn't be a coincidence). Also along for the move is Ellie's cat 
    Church (named after Winston Churchill). The house has a lot of 
    property in the woods, including the mysterious &quot;Pet 
    Sematary&quot;, where animals are buried and come back to life, only 
    they are now evil and extremely violent. The Creed's neighbor is Jud 
    Crandall (John Lithgow, replacing the late Fred Gwynne), whom Ellie 
    takes a<A HREF="pet_sematary_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/pet sematary 2019 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="136" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
    shine to and the Creed family grow to like and trust him. One day, at 
    the hospital, a patient named Victor Pascow (Obssa Ahmed) comes to 
    the ER, a victim of a horrendous accident (One of the nurses screams, 
    &quot;I can see his brains!&quot;) and he dies right in front of 
    Louis before he can treat him. The torn-apart Victor will become 
    Louis' guide to the afterlife, appearing in front of him (only Louis 
    can see him) to warn him about what he is about to do. When Jud finds 
    Church dead on the road, a road in which eighteen-wheelers race down 
    without looking (a direct steal from the first film and Stephen 
    King's novel), he tells Louis to bury it in the Pet Sematary, knowing 
    how much Ellie loved it (only a family member can bury the body if 
    they want it to return from the dead, something Louis doesn't 
    believe, but he soon will be converted). The next day, Church shows 
    up at the house, meaner and violent than he ever was, so much so that 
    it attacks Louis every chance it gets (yet it still loves 
    Ellie).&nbsp; Louis takes Church, drives a very long distance away 
    and lets Church go free, thinking it will never find its way back to 
    the house and he can tell Ellie that cats sometimes decide to run 
    away. At Ellie's birthday party, Ellie sees Church walking down the 
    road and runs to meet it, with an unwatched Gage following her. We 
    then see an eighteen-wheeler barreling down the road and about to hit 
    Gage, when Louis pulls him out of the way just in the nick of time. 
    Only Ellie is not so lucky, as the truck jack-knives and the trailer 
    slides into Ellie, killing her instantly (in my opinion, the best 
    scene in the film). Heartbroken after Ellie's funeral, Rachel goes to 
    live with her parents for a short time, while Louis is left alone to 
    ponder what to do next. Care to guess what that is? Even though Jud 
    tells him not to do it (Saying matter-of-factly, &quot;Sometimes, 
    dead is better&quot;, but not the same way Fred Gwynne said it, the 
    only line which made the original so memorable), Louis digs up Ellie 
    and buries her in the Pet Sematary. What happens next is the same 
    old, same old, as Ellie comes back to life meaner and more evil than 
    any little girl should be. I'm not going to say any more just in case 
    someone has never seen the original or hasn't read Stephen King's 
    novel (which is a hundred times better than any of the films, also

    Greenberg and Jeff Buhler offer nothing different from the original 
    film (Except for the religious aspect to this film, which seems to be 
    a parable about whether God exists or not). Their idea of 
    &quot;different&quot; is to reverse gender roles and call it a 
    &quot;new idea&quot;. It's not and anyone with an ounce of 
    intelligence can see right through their trickery. This isn't a total 
    disaster, thanks to the acting talents of John Lithgow and Jason 
    Clarke, as well as some extreme gore, but it is just not enough for 
    me to recommend it. There's nothing on screen that screams out,

    this, it's weird, but weirdness doesn't necessarily translate into a 
    good film. I will say this, though, it made me think about it long 
    after it ended, but it still gets a failing grade from me, for 
    reasons I'll explain. Kindergarten teacher Gemma (Imogen Poots) and 
    her boyfriend Tom (Jesse Eisenberg) are looking for a house to live 
    in when they get married and find a company that looks like the 
    perfect fit for them, as they are showing homes in a new neighborhood 
    called <A HREF="vivarium_2019.htm#Yonder">Yonder</A>, it's motto 
    being &quot;You're Home. Right Now&quot;, but the young couple are 
    about to discover that Yonder's real motto is &quot;You're Home. 
    Forever&quot;. Tom and Gemma follow very strange realtor Martin 
    (Jonathan Aris) to Yonder in their car, only to discover that this is 
    a neighborhood like no other. All the houses look exactly the same. 
    Same sickly green color, same front and back yard, same everything, 
    right down to the smallest details. Martin takes them to the model 
    home, Number 9, and gives them the grand tour, only he disappears and 
    never returns, forcing Tom and Gemma to hop in their car to find 
    their way out of Yonder. Easier said then done, for no matter what 
    direction they drive, they always <A HREF="vivarium_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/vivarium poster6a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="156" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>end
     up at House Number 9. After trying to find their way out by driving 
    all day and night with no luck, their car runs out of gas, so they 
    decide to stay in House Number 9 for the night, thinking someone will 
    come the next morning to show them the way out. Unfortunately, that 
    never happens and it becomes very clear that they were never meant to 
    leave Yonder, as boxes of food and necessities show up at their door 
    every morning, so they can survive. They even try burning down the 
    house, thinking the fire and smoke will alert authorities, but as 
    they watch across the street as House Number 9 burns, they fall 
    asleep and when they wake up, House Number 9 is still standing, as if 
    it was never on fire. They then realize that they are trapped in some 
    kind of nightmare, but why? It doesn't take a genius to discover why, 
    as the trip this couple take should be memorable, but the film 
    falters during the second half, as everything becomes the same old, 
    same old, repeated ad nauseum. They find a box containing a baby at 
    their front door and they raise him to be a young, extremely strange 
    boy (Senan Jennings, in the film's most affecting performance), but 
    they refuse to give him a name because as Gemma says to him often, 
    &quot;I'm not your mother!&quot;. This Young Boy can mimick Tom and 
    Gemma perfectly, waking them up every morning by screaming at the top 
    of his lungs and then mimicking what the couple said the previous 
    night (a lot of what is repeated should never be said by a boy his 
    age!). The Young Boy also screams every morning until Tom and Gemma 
    make him a bowl of cereal. Tom hates the boy, while Gemma just raises 
    him because she has no other choice. The rest of the film is just 
    rinse and repeat, as Tom thinks he hears something when he puts his 
    ear to the ground in&nbsp; the house's front yard, so he begins 
    digging a hole until it is so deep, he needs a ladder to get in and 
    out. The Young Boy likes to watch TV when it is nothing but a series 
    of patterns and strange symbols (otherwise the TV doesn't work) and 
    Gemma realizes the Young Boy knows more than he is telling. (The 
    film's only real effective scene comes when Gemma tricks the Young 
    Boy into mimicking a man the boy says he talked to, but can't say any 
    more. What <A HREF="vivarium_2019.htm#YoungBoyTransforms">the boy 
    turns into</A> is really shocking and is the main clue why this 
    couple is trapped). While the film would ideally be better as an 
    episode of <B><A HREF="twilight_zone_original_tv_series.htm">THE 
    TWILIGHT ZONE</A></B>, it runs much too long and would have worked 
    better as a thirty minute short. But there are still some good bits 
    in the film, such as Tom painting &quot;<A HREF="vivarium_2019.htm#Help">HELP</A>&quot;
     on the roof of the house, hoping someone flying overhead will see 
    it, but it is obvious they are living in an enclosed environment, as 
    no planes are ever seen in the sky (as a matter of fact, all the 
    clouds look exactly the same and there's a scene where Gemma and the 
    Young Boy are lying on the ground looking at the clouds. Gemma then 
    says that these clouds look like nothing but clouds; none of them 
    look like anything else, like they do in the &quot;real world&quot;). 
    After realizing that there is no hope for rescue, Tom paints a <A HREF="vivarium_2019.htm#FukU">distinctly
     different message</A> on the roof, which did make me laugh. 
    Unfortunately, director Lorcan Finnegan doesn't infuse enough 
    imagination into this Ireland/Denmark/Belgium/UK co-production, for 
    if it contained some more imagination like the roof bits, it would be 
    a film to contend with. I get why people and critics love this film; 
    it's pure nightmare fodder, but it just plods along until the finale, 
    where we learn why the Young Boy, now an adult (Eanna Hardwicke), was 
    put in the care of Gemma and Tom (I won't spoil it for you), as Gemma 
    learns why she is trapped in the house (the curb is able to be lifted 
    by hand [!] and Gemma takes a trip under it she won't soon forget, 
    seeing things that explain everything, or nearly everything). As I 
    said, this film is weird, but when people live their lives the same 
    exact way day after day, month after month, year after year, it can 
    become boring, not only for the young couple, but also for the 
    viewer. It's a well made film, but I expected a little more. You may 
    like it a lot more than I did and I can understand why. It's well 
    acted and photographed, but some of the visual effects just don't 
    make the grade and if you can look beyond that, you may enjoy this. 
    The more I think about this film, the more disappointed I become.;<A NAME="DevilsRevenge2019"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Sure, <B><A HREF="devils_revenge_2019.htm">DEVIL'S REVENGE</A></B> 
    (2019) stars both William Shatner and Jeri Ryan, so there's a <B><A HREF="star_trek_1966.htm">STAR
     TREK</A></B> Universe connection there, but this straight-to-DTV 
    flick is as bad as they come. It's a horror film that makes 
    absolutely no sense at all and when it begins to make a little sense, 
    it defies its own twisted logic and then goes into WTF?!? territory 
    again. And I don't mean good WTF?!? territory, but mind-numbingly bad 
    WTF??? territory. It also doesn't help that Shatner (whose production 
    company partially financed this film) plays a father so mean and 
    pathetic, you want to kick him in the nuts and send him into outer 
    space. The story deals with the married with two college kids John (a 
    simply awful Jason Brooks) searching for an ancient artifact in a 
    cave with two of his closest friends. The artifact has cursed his 
    family for generations and his father, Hayes (William Shatner), won't 
    stop putting down his son until he finds the artifact and destroys it 
    (Really, he's a major prick to his son, vying for worst father of the 
    century!). John finds the artifact, touches it and it disappears. 
    Apparently it awakens the Devil,<A HREF="devils_revenge_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/devil's revenge amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    whose minions murder one of his friends in the cave (offscreen) and 
    turns his other closest friend against him. Now his father really 
    says things to John that no father should say to their son, calling 
    him a &quot;coward&quot; and a &quot;pussy&quot; for losing sight of 
    the artifact and bringing the Devil to Earth, demanding that he look 
    and find the artifact and destroy it before it's too late. Not only 
    does John put his life in danger, he also puts his wife Susan (Jeri 
    Ryan) and teenage kids Eric (Robert Scott Wilson) and Dana (Ciara 
    Hanna) in mortal danger when they demand to go with him to find the 
    artifact. Before they go, John begins to hallucinate, seeing people 
    act the exact opposite of what they really are (he sees a nice kid as 
    a punk and a store clerk as drug dealer) and everyone he comes in 
    contact with are killed by the Devil and his minions (usually 
    offscreen). That's basically the whole film in a nutshell, except 
    when John gets his hands on the artifact and destroys it, it doesn't 
    stop the family curse and the film ends with the Devil winning. See 
    what I mean? It doesn't even follow its own rules and there's a 
    comical scene where Hayes goes into the cave with a grenade launcher 
    and fires it at the Devil and his minions who are only a few feet 
    away, yet Hayes is no worse for wear (one of the minions knocks him 
    down and it's an obvious stunt double, as Shatner was 88-years-old at 
    the time!), when he also should have been blown to pieces. Where 
    should I start to describe how bad this film really is? First of all, 
    the location of the cave changes from scene-to-scene. It takes John 
    and his family a long time to get to it (traveling in a canoe to 
    access to it and that's only a partial trip), yet Hays drives an ATV 
    to it with no problem! Even though the Devil and his minions are 
    portrayed by men in full body makeup (Makeup effects by Vincent J. 
    Guastini and his crew), this film has the need to goose-up the 
    effects with terribly bad CGI, destroying whatever originality this 
    film had. All of the explosions and muzzle flashes are also CGI, as 
    is the blood that is spilled (CGI blood has yet to become realistic, 
    especially in low budget flicks like this), making this film very 
    hard to watch. Director Jared Cohn (a graduate of The Asylum school 
    of filmmaking, which is never a good thing) has basically made a 
    boring TV movie spiced up with a few swear words and a dollop of 
    blood. This is not worth you precious time unless you want to see 
    William Shatner play the father from Hell. Shatner has been in a few 
    hoary movies, but this is probably the hoariest of all. Shot in 
    Louisville, Kentucky, close to Shatner's ranch and stable of horses 
    (which are displayed in the film).;<A NAME="BigTopEvil2019"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Readers of this site know how much I love horror films that take 
    place in a carnival or circus, but even I can find nothing nice to 
    say about <B><A HREF="big_top_evil_2019.htm">BIG TOP EVIL</A> </B>(2019),
     a no-budget horror flick (made for $30,000) about a small-time 
    circus filled with cannibal clowns. It begins like most 
    under-budgeted horror flicks, with seven annoying twenty-somethings 
    on their way to the out-of-the-way location where the Mangrove 
    Slasher killed a bunch of people. Included in this group is slightly 
    retarded Donny (Morgan Ferreira, who is simply horrible, playing 
    retarded like it's some kind of comical situation!) and the morose 
    Jay (co-director/co-writer/producer Sean Haitz, who isn't good in any 
    of his duties, including acting), who has just broken up with his 
    long-time girlfriend, who cheated on him. There are also two more 
    guys and three girls on this trip, but none of <A HREF="big_top_evil_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/big top evil amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>them
     are worth mentioning, because they act like total amateurs. On their 
    way to the Mangrove Slasher location, they stop for gas and a pretty 
    woman named Candy (Austin Graham) begins hitting on Donny, telling 
    him he should come to the circus she performs at and they all can 
    stay in the hotel across the street from the circus. Since the group 
    wants to get Donny laid (he's still a virgin), they stupidly stay at 
    the run-down hotel and then visit the circus, where the weird 
    audience members look at them as if they are food (One kid bites one 
    of the male group members on his arm!). It turns out Candy is the 
    daughter of the circus boss (Mark Manning), who keeps a bunch of 
    cannibal clowns in a nearby warehouse to feed on audience members. 
    One cruel clown, Mr. Kharver (Bill Moseley, who acts like Otis 
    Driftwood from Rob Zombie's <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#House 1000 Corpses">HOUSE
     OF 1000 CORPSES</A></B> <A HREF="devils_rejects_2005.htm">trilogy</A> [<A HREF="#ThreeFromHell2019">2002
     - 2019</A>]. Even though his role is only a slightly extended cameo, 
    it is obvious that he took the lion's share of the budget as payment 
    for appearing in this turd.), who is not a member of this circus, 
    tries to hire clowns away from the Boss, but they are all turned-off 
    by Kharver's filthy put-downs (That's as far as Moseley's role goes 
    her. He disappears at the halfway mark and never returns.). When 
    Candy temps Donny with sex (He turns out to be a premature 
    ejaculator!), she knocks him out and when he awakens, he finds 
    himself tied to a wall covered in plastic. Candy enters with a 
    chainsaw and cuts him to pieces (offscreen). The rest of the film 
    details the group trying to avoid the cannibal clowns (The Boss yells 
    out, &quot;Release the horde!&quot;) and failing spectaculatly. The 
    only survivor is Jay, who is arrested and found guilty of first 
    degree murder and put on Death Row. The entire film is told as a 
    flashback, as a Innocence Project-like representative interviews Jay 
    from prison and he explains exactly what happened and how he is 
    innocent of murder. Eventually, he is found not guilty and released, 
    but that doesn't stop the clowns from trying to kill him. But that 
    will be another film, as it is left wide open for a sequel. 
    Co-directorsSean Haitz and Chris Potter (who has the role of Trevor, 
    one of the members of the twenty-something group) fail to elicit any 
    horror or terror here, as it is the typical low-budget stalk 'n' 
    slash horror flick without an original bone in its entire body. While 
    the film is very bloody, it seems to pull away from the gore as it is 
    about to happen (such as Donny's chainsaw death) and throws blood on 
    walls and people to illustrate the gore. There is one scene when one 
    of the girls gets her leg caught in a bear trap and a clown feasts on 
    her exposed leg flesh, but it's poorly done, just like the rest of 
    the gore. If it isn't found footage films, it's killer clown flicks 
    that first-time directors seem to pick as their first feature film 
    (Both Haitz and Potter are freshmen here) and none of them are 
    particularly good (this one is an editing nightmare; if you decide to 
    watch it, you will know what I mean), this film included. Unless you 
    have to see every killer clown film ever made, you can just skip this 
    one and move on to the next one. I wish I did!;<A NAME="AgramonsGate2019"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="agramons_gate_2019.htm">AGRAMON'S GATE</A></B> (2019) 
    had all the ingredients of being a good film, but disjointed 
    storytelling and an ending, that will want you calling the police to 
    report a robbery, destroys the film of any enjoyment you could have 
    had. Richie Stann (Kris Reilly) and his wife Cassidy (Kaiti Wallen) 
    invite some friends over for a party, also hiring gypsy psychic 
    medium Vesna (Aphrodite Nikolovski) to read everyone's fortune, even 
    though Richie doesn't believe in such things. Cassidy tries to get 
    Richie to have his fortune read, but he refuses, so Vesna says she 
    should have a seance, where everyone participates, even Richie. 
    During the seance, Vesna connects with one female's dead grandmother 
    and after that, all Hell breaks loose. Vesna becomes possessed by a 
    spirit saying he is the dead father of Richie, Vesna speaking in a 
    creepy voice telling Richie, &quot;This time, it will be 
    different&quot; and everyone holding hands is then struck by a force 
    that sends them reeling backwards. It turns out Richie has a secret 
    only Cassidy knows about. When he was twelve, he shot his father, 
    Carter (Yan Birch; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#SlumberPartyMass3">SLUMBER
     PARTY MASSACRE III</A></B> - 1990), in the head when he was choking 
    his mother, Sharon (Laurene Landon; <B><A HREF="hundra_1983.htm">HUNDRA</A></B> 
    - 1983). Carter was an evil man who abused Richie and Sharon 
    constantly, which lead to the shooting. The trouble is<A HREF="agramons_gate_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/agramon's gate poster6a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>,
     Sharon was admitted to a mental institution immediately after the 
    shooting, where she still resides today, refusing to speak to Richie. 
    Richie blames the seance on Cassidy, saying she must have told Vesna 
    about his past, but she denies telling anyone about his past. It 
    turns out that the spirit that posessed Vesna was not Carter, but a 
    powerful demon named Agramon (portrayed by Asian actress Calhoun 
    Koenig). Vesna's best friend and fellow supernatural expert, the facially-scarred,
     one-eyed Zeb (director/screenwriter/executive producer/casting 
    director Harley Wallen), tells Vesna and Richie, &quot;Even though 
    the demon Baal is considered the Devil's right hand, I would say that 
    Agramon is the Devil's left hand and the Devil is left-handed!&quot; 
    It turns out everyone at the party is about to be supernaturally 
    tortured by Agramon, who is able to shapeshift into anyone he wants 
    to be, be it Carter, Sharon or any of Richie's friends. Agramon 
    begins to make Richie's life unbearable, appearing as his father and 
    telling him that he should join him. When Richie visits his mother at 
    the mental institution, all she has to say to him is, &quot;He is you 
    and you are him!&quot;, screaming it over and over. It surprises 
    Richie when Sharon escapes from the mental institution and pays him 
    and Cassidy a visit at their home, but she disappears the following 
    morning. When Richie calls the mental institution, Sharon's nurse, 
    Katherine (Chevonne Wilson), tells him he must be mistaken, Sharon 
    didn't escape from the hospital, she has been here all night. Will 
    Vesna and Zeb be able to save Richie from Agramon, who gets stronger 
    by feeding off the fear of his victims? Damned as fuck if I know, as 
    the film just ends with nothing being concluded, as Agramon, 
    pretending to be one of Richie's friends, comes into the house, 
    attacks Zeb and we see a possessed Vesna telling Zeb (whom we don't 
    see) that he will be fine. THE END!!! I didn't spend 110 minutes for 
    nothing to happen! I mean, what the fuck did I spend nearly two hours 
    watching? It's nothing but a bunch of disjointed scenes slapped 
    together by the thinnest of connective tissue and I was scratching my 
    head wondering what exactly was happening until the blood from my 
    scalp wounds flowed intro my eyes. Toss in no blood or gore, zero 
    nudity and Vesna's thick French accent which is very hard to 
    understand (even the available English subtitles couldn't understand 
    her, as the word &quot;<I>unintelligible</I>&quot; [in parenthesis] 
    keeps popping up nearly every time she speaks!), making this film a 
    long slog to get through. I was hoping for some type of conclusion 
    (there's a huge ancient dagger that will kill Agramon, but it never 
    is used!), but the non-ending really was annoying, as 110-minutes is 
    a long time to invest in without getting any type of payoff. Fuck 
    Harley Wallen and fuck this film for promising me the world and 
    delivering me a small rock. It's not really a small rock, it's more 
    like some dried shit shaped like a small rock. If you see Harley 
    Wallen's name attached to any film, run in the opposite direction, 
    especially if a promised sequel happens. Fool me once, shame on you, 
    fool me twice and you'll get shot in the head!;<A NAME="Underwater2019"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

     forcing me to turn on the English subtitles, even though everyone is 
    speaking English! All the nasty things said about this film were well 
    deserved, because, frankly, I fail to see how anyone could enjoy 
    this. This film takes place completely underwater, as a matter of 
    fact, it takes place nearly 7 miles down in the Mariana Trench in the 
    Pacific Ocean, which is thought to be the deepest part of any ocean 
    on Earth. The Triton Corporation has built a drilling facility 
    looking for precious minerals, such as crude oil, on the bottom of 
    the ocean floor and when the film begins, the camera tracks an 
    elevator-like pipe that travels down to the seven mile-deep facility, 
    while newspaper articles inform us that there are rumors of trouble 
    down there, such as unknown noises and creatures not yet discovered 
    (if you look at the dates on some of these articles, you will see 
    that the film takes place in the year 2050). It is also said that 
    being down there too long under such extreme pressure and lack of 
    sunlight can cause dizziness, hallucinations and worse, setting up 
    the basis of the film for us. We are then introduced to the butch 
    Norah Price (Kristen Stewart; the, ugh, <B><A HREF="twilight_2008.htm">TWILIGHT</A></B><A HREF="twilight_2008.htm"> franchise</A> 
    [2008 - 2012]; who cut off all her hair and dyed what is left of it 
    blonde; she also has the flattest chest of any woman I have ever 
    seen!), as she brushes her teeth and spies a daddy long legs spider 
    coming out of the sink faucet (How the fuck did it get all the way 
    down there?). She begins to hear strange noises coming from above as 
    the lights flicker on and off in the station. Suddenly, the entire 
    facility starts to implode and Norah must run to the nearest control 
    room and shut the hull door to stop the imploding from continuing. 
    She meets fellow crew member Rodrigo (Mamoudou Athie) in the control 
    room and has to rewire the computer to close the hull door, but she 
    sees fellow crewmembers running towards the door while the corridor 
    is rapidly imploding behind them, but they will not make it in time, 
    so Norah is forced to close the door before she and Rodrigo are also 
    victims, killing her fellow crewmembers in the process. An explosion 
    then occurs in the control room, knocking out Norah and Rodrigo. When 
    they wake, they must find their way to the escape pods to go up top 
    to the surface before the nuclear core in this sector explodes in 30 
    minutes (sound familiar?). They must traverse destroyed sections of 
    the site, finding dead bodies along the way, but also finding crew 
    member Paul Abel (a simply terrible T.J. Miller; <B><A HREF="deadpool_2016.htm">DEADPOOL</A></B> 
    - 2016; who is the &quot;comedy relief&quot; here) buried under some 
    rubble and freeing him. The trio then make their way to the escape 
    pods, where they meet Captain Lucien (Vincent Cassel; <B><A HREF="brotherhood_of_the_wolf_2001.htm">BROTHERHOOD
     OF THE WOLF</A></B> - 2001), the man in charge of the facility, who 
    tells them that all the escape pods were used here, as he sent up 22 
    crewmembers (some of them dead!) to safety in them. The reason he 
    didn't go with them is, well, you know, the Captain always goes down 
    with his ship. Captain Lucien comes up with the only plan that can 
    save everyone before the core explodes. They must go further down to 
    the ocean floor, travel over a mile in their very heavy protective 
    diving suits and make it to the Roebuck Station, where there should 
    be enough escape pods for everyone. Also joining in on this trek are 
    crewmembers Liam Smith (John Gallagher Jr.; <B><A HREF="10_cloverfield_lane_2016.htm">10
     CLOVERFIELD LANE</A></B> - 2016) and Emily Haversham (Jessica 
    Henwick; Netflix's <B><A HREF="iron_fist_tv_series_2017.htm">IRON FIST</A></B> 
    [2017 - 2018]), who love each other (aww!). The only problem is they 
    are not alone, as tentacled creatures are stalking them. The rest of 
    the film is basically Norah trying to save everyone, especially 
    Captain Lucien, whom we think she is in love with, even though he is 
    married and has a 14-year-old daughter, and failing spectacularly. 
    The crewmembers die in the order Norah found them, first with 
    Rodrigo, who is pulled completely out of his suit by the tentacled 
    creatures, his suit filling up with blood. The next to go is Paul 
    (Thank God. If I had to hear one more of his &quot;comical&quot; 
    wisecracks, I would have slit my wrists!), who has an arm torn off 
    (it should have been his tongue!) while walking in his suit on the 
    ocean floor, killing him instantly (Or does it? This film never makes 
    it clear). The next to go is Captain Lucien, who is rapidly pulled 
    upwards while Norah is attached to him by a safety line, forcing the 
    Captain to disengage the line before both of them implode by rapidly 
    traveling upwards. Norah then watches helplessly as her Captain's 
    suit implodes above her. For some reason not made clear (there are a 
    lot of 'em in this film!), Liam disappears just as Norah and Emily 
    make it to the Roebuck Station (I bet Sears loves this film!), but 
    there are hundreds of sleeping tentacled creatures above in the area 
    surrounding the door entrance, all their tentacles hanging down in 
    front them. Emily makes it to safety and so does Liam (Where the fuck 
    was he?), but Norah must fight one of the creatures, who swallows her 
    whole! She uses a flare gun to shoot her way out of the creature and 
    she makes it to safety in the Roebuck Station, but she notices one 
    disturbing thing that she doesn't mention to Liam or Emily: There's a 
    Godzilla-sized tentacled creature outside the station (looking 
    exactly like Lovecraft's Cthulhu) and if it attacked, it will crush 
    the station easily. When they check the station for escape pods, 
    there are three available (What would have happened if everyone 
    survived? These are one-person pods!), but the third pod is 
    malfunctioning and will not work. Norah sends Liam and a worried 
    Emily on their way to safety, but when she sees a group of creatures 
    approaching the escape pods and will reach them very shortly, Norah 
    decides to sacrifice herself by overloading the station's nuclear 
    core and the Roebuck Station explodes, killing the giant creature and 
    all its offspring. Extinction be damned, we never knew these 
    creatures existed anyway, so why worry about killing them all? The 
    film closes with newspaper articles stating that the Triton 
    Corporation will rebuild the drilling station and the two survivors, 
    Emily and Liam, are not available for questioning. Another cover-up. 
    Hey, what about all the crewmembers that Captain Lucien sent up in 
    the escape pods? Didn't they make it? That's the exact problem with 
    this film. There are too many unanswered questions and stupid things<A HREF="underwater_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/underwater 2019 poster8a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    that are done here. The first thing that crossed my mind was this: If 
    they are seven miles beneath the surface, it is quite possible that 
    they are in entire darkness and anything living down there would be 
    eyeless or blind (because, evolution) and they would probably rely on 
    sound or smell to catch their food, so why does every person in this 
    film talk non-stop and loudly throughout the entire film? Wouldn't 
    that give away their position? It only makes sense, because these 
    creatures follow them wherever they go, so wouldn't these people of 
    science realize that? I guess not, because they never shut up, 
    especially Paul and his unfunny comments. For some reason there is 
    also an Alice In Wonderland vibe here, as Paul carries around a 
    stuffed rabbit and treats it as if it was alive and there are many 
    hidden images that reference Lewis Carroll's story, including a Queen 
    of Spades playing card that is spotted when the group treks to their 
    destination. Director William Eubank (who gave us the wonderful <B><A HREF="signal_2014.htm">THE
     SIGNAL</A></B> - 2014), working with a screenplay co-written by 
    Brian Duffield &amp; Adam Cozad, definitely had a large budget to 
    work with, but the murkiness of the photography and the hard-to-understand
     dialogue do this film no favors. We also don't get a good look at 
    the CGI creatures until the very end and the giant creature is also 
    very hard to see. There are many &quot;tributes&quot; to <B><A HREF="alien_1979c.htm">ALIEN</A></B> 
    here, especially the scene when a baby creature attacks Paul as he 
    watches a bunch of small creatures feeding on a dead body. He brings 
    it inside and it looks almost exactly like the creature that burst 
    out of John Hurt's body in the dinner scene and everyone looks at it 
    on a lighted table, the same way as the crew of the Nostromo looked 
    at the face hugger that attached itself to Hurt's face. Eubank has 
    gone on record saying this was done purposely, as well as the 
    creatures looking like Lovecraft creations, as he was a fan of both 
    the film and Lovecraft's works. They say imitation is the sincerest 
    form of flattery, but that makes no sense when it comes to movies, 
    Why watch an imitation of a classic when you know it can't be better 
    than the original? This shit has to stop. Try something original for 
    a change! This is a very claustrophobic film, so if you suffer from 
    that malady, or have a modicum of good taste, you should avoid this 
    film at all costs.</FONT></FONT></P>

     REDWOOD MASSACRE</A></B> (2014) and since I reviewed that bloody, 
    but awkwardly paced horror flick, I decided that I needed to review 
    this one, too (I actually purchased the film from Prime, as it was 
    not free [yet]). Just like the first one, it was 
    directed/written/edited/photographed/sound designed by David Ryan 
    Keith, who didn't learn from his mistakes from the first film, as it 
    is sloppy in spots, slow in spots and very gory in spots. It was also 
    filmed in Scotland in 20 days. It also contains acting by one of the 
    worst actresses of the New Millennium, Danielle Harris (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackWatersPond2009">THE
     BLACK WATERS OF ECHO'S POND</A></B> - 2009), who tries to redeem 
    herself here, but just doesn't quite pull it off. The only returning 
    actor from the first film is the killer himself (portrayed by 
    Benjamin Selway), but instead of being <A HREF="redwood_massacre_annihilation_2020.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/redwood massacre annihilation poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="155" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>called&nbsp;
     the &quot;Evil Maniac&quot;, as he was named in the first film, he 
    is known as the &quot;Burlap Killer&quot; here, thanks to the burlap 
    mask he wears. He also gets an origin story here (but is is never 
    quite explained properly), which was lacking in the first film. In 
    the first film, the only survivor of the massacre was a woman named 
    Pamela and the film opens with Pamela's husband Max (Damien Puckler; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#SixSixSixTheBeast07">666:
     THE BEAST</A></B> - 2007) torturing Pamela (not played by the same 
    actress as in the first film), keeping her secured to a wooden chair 
    by having huge nails hammered into her wrists (!). He wants Pamela to 
    tell him where the Burlap Killer hides out (for some unexplained 
    reason, Max worships him) and where the bodies of all her dead 
    friends are being kept, but she refuses to tell him, so Max kills 
    Pamela by graphically stabbing her in the stomach over and over 
    (&quot;This is fun!&quot;, says Max as he thrusts away with the 
    knife). He then goes to a sparsely attended book signing of author 
    Tom Dempsey (John Campling; <B><A HREF="zombie_massacre_2013.htm">ZOMBIE
     MASSACRE</A></B> - 2013), who wrote a book about the Redwood 
    Massacre, since his daughter was one of the missing teens who was 
    there with Pamela (Pamela refused to tell anyone what happened in the 
    woods, which led to her being committed to a psychiatric clinic for a 
    few years). After the book signing is over, Max convinces Tom to come 
    to his house because he has something important to show him. A 
    hesitant Tom agrees to go, where Max shows Tom the Burlap Killer's 
    mask and weapon of choice, a modified machete (Unexplained how he got 
    them, but I can guess that Pamela took them when her ordeal ended). 
    He tells Tom he knows where the killer is hiding out and Tom agrees 
    to go with him (he has searched to woods for his daughter for nearly 
    ten years), but first he needs to reassemble his team, which includes 
    mistrusting kickboxing daughter Laura (Danielle Harris; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HatchetIII2013">HATCHET
     III</A></B> - 2013), her sexy Asian friend Jen (Tevy Poe) and 
    hulking mercenary (and sex-&amp;-gun-loving) Gus 
    (Co-Producer/Stuntman Gary Kasper; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Butchers2014">THE
     BUTCHERS</A></B> - 2014 [also co-starring Damien Puckler]; the best 
    thing about this film), who brings a rather large caliber automatic 
    weapon, able to shoot through solid steel, along with him (it will be 
    extremely helpful in the finale). Max tells everyone that there is a 
    large military base in the middle of the woods, even though Tom's 
    group, especially Laura, doesn't trust Max and for good reason 
    (Before they leave, Max gets a phone call from someone giving him the 
    coordinates where the military base is located. We then discover that 
    Max is wearing the Burlap Killer's mask and is fucking a dead woman, 
    while her husband, who is tied to a chair, is forced to watch! After 
    he is done, Max kills the husband by slitting his throat and stabbing 
    him to death.). We then see the group in the woods getting nearer to 
    their destination, even though Laura is sure that they covered the 
    same ground years ago and there was no military base to see anywhere 
    around there. She is correct, because when they come to a deserted 
    house with a locked gate with a &quot;No Trespassing&quot; sign 
    attached to it, Laura discovers that it is an underground military 
    base directly beneath their feet, so they find the hidden entrance 
    and travel down to the base (which doesn't explain why one set of 
    stairs contains a window on the wall!) and get trapped inside. Max 
    then disappears and we see him placing the mask on a recently 
    decomposing skeleton's skull and the machete at the skeleton's feet, 
    yelling for the Burlap Killer to come get his special surprises, 
    items he has been missing for a long time. The Burlap Killer appears, 
    puts on the mask (this is the only time we gat a quick look at his 
    malformed face), takes the machete and walks away from Max, not 
    killing him (at least not yet!). Laura and Gus find a box full of 
    human body parts in jars. When Gus asks her what body part is in the 
    jar he is holding, Laura says, &quot;It's a dick!&quot;, so Gus 
    throws it to the ground and steps on it, where we can hear a 
    disgusting &quot;squishing&quot; sound! Long story short, this is not 
    a military base at all, but some kind of top-secret government 
    hospital, where all the personnel who worked inside have died 
    gruesome deaths (their mutilated bodies are littered all over the 
    place). The group finds documents telling them that soldiers were 
    operated on here, turning them into maniacal killers and the Burlap 
    Killer was one of them. Of course everyone splits up, only to become 
    fodder for the Burlap killer. The first to die is Jen, who is knocked 
    out by Max and chained spread-eagle, Max yelling for the Burlap 
    Killer to come get his surprise. The Burlap Killer then appears and 
    kills Jen with his machete (cutting her throat and running it through 
    her skull), carrying her dead body to another room (where Tom is 
    hiding in fear), placing it on a table, disembowling her with his 
    bare hands and sawing off all her appendages (nothing is left to the 
    imagination). Tom manages to escape with a shotgun, but is beheaded 
    by the Burlap Killer shortly thereafter. Laura and Gus discover a 
    beautiful nattily-dressed woman hiding in the base and ask her why 
    she is there. She tells them that her name is Donna (Stephanie Lynn 
    Styles) and she was hiking in the woods when the killer murdered her 
    boyfriend, so she ran away and ended up here with no way to escape. 
    She then disappears and Gus says he doesn't trust Donna one bit 
    because she is wearing high heels. Who in their right mind would wear 
    high heels while hiking? After watching the Burlap<A HREF="redwood_massacre_annihilation_2020.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/redwood massacre annihilation poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    Killer cutting off a hiker's legs with a tree branch saw (really 
    graphic), he then goes after Laura and Gus. Max tries to knock out 
    Laura, which upsets the Burlap Killer, who lops off Max's head with 
    an axe at Donna's request (Max may also be one of the hospital's 
    patients, but it is never made clear). Gus is able to get a radio 
    working in between the power going off and on. Laura is able to 
    contact someone to come to their rescue, as the Burlap Killer knocks 
    her out (after she uses some kickboxing moves on him unsuccessfully) 
    and Gus challenges him mano a mano. A stupid decision, as the Burlap 
    Killer drops his axe and Gus then drops his large caliber automatic 
    weapon (I would have shot him on the spot!). During the fight, the 
    Burlap Killer gets the upper hand and is about to kill Gus with the 
    axe, when Laura appears, automatic weapon in hand, and shoots the 
    Burlap Killer several times until he drops dead to the floor. To make 
    sure he is dead, she chops off his head with the axe. Then the 
    government official (Alec Westwood), who Laura talked to over the 
    radio, appears with a soldier and asks them if anyone else is alive. 
    When they reply no, the soldier shoots Laura and Gus in the head, 
    killing them! Donna then appears and tells the Man in Black that they 
    are moving the entire operation to Nevada (she is the one clearly in 
    charge of the operation), picks up the Burlap Killer's head, looks it 
    in the eyes and says, &quot;We are going to Las Vegas. Momma needs a 
    new pair of shoes!&quot;, leaving the film wide open for the 
    inevitable sequel. THE END. While very gory and bloody (the effects 
    are pretty good), the film is overlong at 104 minutes. There is too 
    much corridor walking by the cast to make the film scary or 
    effective. Just like the first film, jack-of-all-trades David Ryan 
    Keith handles too many jobs and the film falters for it. While 
    gorehounds may love this film, those who want an effective story to 
    go along with the gore are going to be disappointed. Technically, 
    it's a very professional-looking film, but there are bits and pieces 
    missing that would make this a good movie. Things such as common 
    sense (Why is Max so enamored with the Burlap Killer? Why drop your 
    weapon when you have a clear shot at the killer? Why split up in a 
    place you are not familiar with?), sensible plot points (Why were 
    they experimenting on soldiers? What was their purpose? What happened 
    to the other soldiers who were experimented on?) and an over-reliance 
    of slasher film tropes (including the downbeat finale), do this film 
    in in the long run. Not bad, but not good either. It just is.;<A NAME="Stuck2020"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <A HREF="stuck_trapped_in_the_dark_2020.htm"><B>STUCK - TRAPPED IN 
    THE DARK</B></A> (<I>Stuck - Intrappolati Dell'oscurita</I> - 2020) 
    is an Italian horror film that is trapped in mediocrity. It does have 
    a germ of originality and a twist you will never see coming (I know I 
    didn't), but it is nothing that will save this film from basically 
    being the same old, same old. A group of speleologists (cave 
    explorers) find an unknown bomb shelter somewhere in the mountains of 
    Genoa (filmed on location) and most of them are attacked, killed and 
    eaten by cannibalistic humanoid bat creatures created by a Nazi 
    scientist in 1942, hoping to make humans more adaptable to nature 
    (Something about humans living contrary to nature, needing houses 
    rather than caves to live in). A businessman, Ettore (Daniele Raco), 
    who sent the speleologists down into the cave to explore it, becomes 
    worried when <A HREF="stuck_trapped_in_the_dark_2020.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/stuck trapped in the dark amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>his
     crew doesn't contact him, especially his star employee Irene (Ilaria 
    Scaliti), so he sends a rescue team into the cave, headed by Princi 
    (Michela Gatto) and Leo (Mario Giustini), to find out what happened 
    to them. A secondary story involves a drunk divorced father named 
    Mauro (David Scarantino) trying to figure out why his nameless 
    daughter (Beatrice Giustini) is going to the same cave, drawing 
    pictures of the creatures in a sketch pad, feeding them (live sheep!) 
    and giving his clothes to them (He slaps his daughter hard across her 
    face when he finds her coming home from the cave, even though he 
    warned her to keep away from it). After all this drama, the film 
    becomes nothing but a series of people exploring the caves and trying 
    to (unsuccessfully) avoid the creatures (some have wings and walk 
    upright and some walk on all fours; one of them even wears a WWII gas 
    mask!), who graphically chow down on them.&nbsp; When Irene is the 
    only person who is left alive from the original speleologists and 
    Princi and Leo find her, it is revealed that Irene is actually the 
    nameless daughter of Mauro, only now she is an adult and still a 
    friend of the creatures. She feeds them by luring people into the 
    cave system for their dinner. That's right, the Mauro/Daughter 
    sub-story didn't take place in the present, as we were led to 
    believe, but about a decade earlier (think <B><A HREF="saw_franchise_2004-2010.htm">JIGSAW</A></B> 
    - 2017). Princi pays for it with her life by the creatures, but Irene 
    gets stabbed in the stomach before Princi is eaten, forcing&nbsp; a 
    suspicious Leo to leave a dying Irene in the cave while he escapes to 
    freedom. The finale finds Ettore's lawyers offering Leo a large sum 
    of money if he will sign a non-disclosure agreement, but he refuses 
    to do so, telling them he will only sign it if he can have a 
    face-to-face with Ettore. THE END. While the creatures are an 
    interesting concoction, wearing full-body suits to make their skin 
    look look different than ours, it is rather obvious that they are 
    body suits because they don't move or adhere to human movement, 
    bunching up unlike the skin of a human being. The graphic gore is 
    quite good, though, and plentiful, as members of the cast we become 
    involved with, such as Sara (Camilla Grilli), an original member of 
    the speleologist team, manages to escape a few times from the 
    creatures, but she is then unceremoniously eaten by them. This is a 
    film where no one is safe, but it is just not enough to make this 
    film rise from the pack. I will have to say that its short 78-minute 
    running time doesn't leave you time to get bored or watching the 
    clock, but freshman director/screenwriter Alessio De Bernardi fails 
    to make this film memorable in any way, unless you are a fan of 
    graphic gore (lots of shots of creatures eating people and ripping 
    out their intestines and dining on them). All others are warned to 
    stay away. In Italian with English subtitles and available streaming

    (1996) and <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#AssaultPrecinct1376">ASSAULT 
    ON PRECINCT 13</A></B> (1976), but cheap, unconvincing CGI and 
    terrible acting do the film no favors. Just as S.W.A.T. Team leader 
    Vernon (Richard Grieco; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#RaidersOfTheDamned">RAIDERS
     OF THE DAMNED</A></B> - 2005; who looks like he is pumped full of 
    Valium, even acting that way) learns he is dying of blood cancer, he 
    and his team raid the location where deadly criminal Hades (the 
    heavily-inked Robert LaSardo; <B><A HREF="anarchy_parlor_2014.htm">ANARCHY
     PARLOR</A></B> - 2014); and the best thing about this film) is 
    hiding out. As they are transporting him to a holding cell in an 
    understaffed police station (after a rather unconvincing CGI-enhanced 
    gun battle with Hade's men), aliens in huge fucking spaceship begin 
    destroying Los Angeles and other major towns across the world with 
    deadly rays, forcing the S.W.A.T. team van to crash. The aliens land 
    and begin hunting humans for their blood (That's right, they're Space 
    Vampires! Paging Tobe Hooper's <B><A HREF="lifeforce_1985.htm">LIFEFORCE</A></B> 
    [1985]!) and kill humans by shooting tentacles out of the palms of 
    their three-clawed hands and sucking out their blood until none is 
    left in their bodies (the tentacles are so phony-looking and the CGI 
    used to create them is so sub-par, it takes you right out of the 
    film). After losing some team members to the alien's tentacles, 
    Vernon and the rest of his team make it to the police station, lock 
    Hades in a cell (after some rowdy prisoners threaten to 
    &quot;skull-fuck&quot; Vernon and his team) and begin sealing off the 
    station so the aliens cannot get<A HREF="attack_of_the_unknown_2020.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/attack of the unknown poster42a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="146" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    inside. Of course, they fail miserably, and the aliens get inside and 
    begin thinning Vernon's crew until only him and female S.W.A.T. team 
    member Hannah (Jolene Andersen; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#HellraiserRevalat10">HELLRAISER:
     REVELATIONS</A></B> - 2011) are left. Before Vernon loses nearly his 
    whole team, Hades seems to know a lot about these aliens, telling 
    Vernon they have been coming to Earth for centuries (A flashback 
    shows us Hade's great-grandfather in the Wild West, as the aliens 
    come to Earth and begin killing everyone; men, women and children 
    alike. One of those women is Tara Reid [<B><A HREF="#BusPartyToHell2018">BUS
     PARTY TO HELL</A></B> - 2018], who does a three-minute cameo for 
    some quick booze/coke money). The aliens take what they need, leave 
    Earth and return when they need more blood (It's their food). Vernon 
    and Hannah discover that there's a tunnel that leads to another 
    police station a block away, but what they don't know is that the 
    aliens can read minds by putting their three-clawed hands on the 
    skull of their dead victims and steal their memories. The film ends 
    with Vernon killing one of the aliens by injecting it with his 
    cancerous blood, but before the alien dies, it shoots a tentacle into 
    Vernon's heart and he dies. Hannah is picked up by a helicopter and 
    taken to Area 51, where we learn that the government knows all about 
    the aliens and have given up on saving anyone. Hannah pulls out three 
    syringes of Vernon's blood and says we now have a weapon to defeat 
    them and the film ends, probably so a sequel can be made. First the 
    plusses: The only positive thing I can say about this film is the 
    aliens, created by Vincent J. Guastini (<B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm#TakingDebLogan2014">THE
     TAKING OF DEBORAH LOGAN</A></B> - 2014) and his crew, are pretty 
    good. It's the rest of the film that's problematic, as 
    director/screenwriter Brandon Slagle offers nothing new and pays 
    &quot;tribute' to so many films and does it in a way that's anything 
    but flattering. Richard Grieco sleepwalks through his role and shows 
    no emotion, especially when he shoots an innocent woman in the head 
    because she is dying from a tentacle attack. He simply pulls the 
    trigger and acts like it's no big deal. Also terrible is Johnny Huang 
    as Dallas, a YouTuber who joins forces with Vernon and his team, 
    thinking he can use weapons because he's an excellent gamer. He's 
    this film's comedy relief but he's anything but funny as his delivery 
    is flat and unconvincing, making his death a welcome relief. The film 
    also has over a hundred Executive and Associate Producers, which is 
    an instant sign that this film was financed by an Internet funding 
    site and none of these people were ever on set, yet they are all 
    listed in the end credits, making it a rather long affair. While I 
    applaud the idea of the film, in reality it's pretty poor and 
    executed in a very bad manner, thanks abysmal acting and cheezy CGI 
    that could be done on someone's home computer. I can't honestly 
    recommend this, even though it won awards at film festivals you never 
    heard of. To me, that's a sign of death. I lost interest in the film 
    as soon as Robert LaSardo was killed by an alien (who may be his 
    father!). You probably will, too.;<A NAME="CannibalTroll2020"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="cannibal_troll_2020.htm">CANNIBAL TROLL</A></B> (2020, 
    not 2021, as most reference sites list it. Watch the fucking end 
    credits, Bozos, and quit depending on IMDb for &quot;correct&quot; 
    information!) is one of those bad DTV flicks that offers nothing but 
    refried scares disguised as &quot;relevent&quot; modern-day truisms. 
    A group of four young women on a &quot;hen weekend&quot; (i.e. a 
    two-day bachelorette party) decide to spend the weekend camping in 
    the woods, unaware that there is a creature that loves to eat human 
    flesh who resides there. One of the young women, Lizzy (Megan 
    Purvis), is pregnant and another, Yara (Barbara Dabson), is a lesbian 
    who wants to hook up with best friend Casey (Georgina Jane). Another 
    member, Ava (Nicole Nabi), has brought along her mother, Emma (Kate 
    Sandison), to cook for them (all the other women don't seem to mind).

     Troll (Zuza Tehanu, in a hoary getup that looks as if it was 
    purchased from a costume shop) has a young black girl named Keily 
    (Faith Kiggundu) chained up in his shack, forcing her to eat meat 
    that is quite possibly human (we are never told) and perform sexually 
    for him (though we never see it). Keily escapes from the shack and 
    the chase is on, as she runs into the bridesmaids and the Troll kills 
    Emma first with his trusty arrows. The rest of the film details the 
    women trying to escape the troll and doing a real bad job at it, 
    leaving Casey and Yara as the only survivors, taking Lizzy's newborn 
    baby with them to raise as their own. THE END. This British horror 
    film has little to recommend, especially since the title promises us 
    cannibalism, yet we see absolutely none. Add to that that the 
    violence and gore in this film is very sparse, almost non-existant, 
    as we only see the troll hack away at Yara's back with a knife as she 
    is trying to escape, Casey pulling her away before she dies (she 
    spends the rest of the film moaning in pain and barely limping along, 
    as Casey tries to help her escape from the troll). The total lack of 
    nudity also does this film no favors, although it seems that most 
    modern day DTV films avoid nudity at all costs (If I see one more 
    shot of a woman making love to a man while wearing her bra and 
    panties, I'm gonna scream bloody murder! Give me '70s exploitation 
    any day!). The Cannibal Troll is not scary in the least, it's grunts 
    and groans eliciting laughter instead of fear. So how do Yara and 
    Casey battle the Troll? Why they simply go the the local church (The 
    priest, Samuel [Richard Harfst], was killed by the troll in the woods 
    as he was about to warn the women about the deadly danger they are 
    in) and play the organ! It has some kind of adverse effect on the 
    troll that was explained by Father Samuel, but his thick Cockney 
    accent was quite hard to comprehend and, really, I couldn't be 
    bothered with turning on English subtitles, as I just wanted the film 
    to end ten minutes after it began (I could guess how everything was 
    going to progress and end on those ten minutes alone). It took two 
    people to direct this piece of dried mule muffins, Scott Jeffreyand 
    Rebecca Matthews (who also both Produced), and they offer nothing to 
    the horror genre at all, except for bloodless violence (the camera 
    always pulls away just as it is about to get bloody), a lack of any 
    real scares and uninteresting characters, all wrapped up in 
    84-minutes of extreme tedium. Scott Jeffrey (who also wrote the 
    screenplay to this film) also directed another weak horror DTV film I 
    recently watched titled <B><A HREF="conjuring_the_genie_2021.htm">CONJURING
     THE GENIE</A></B> (2021), which starred many of the actors in this 
    film, but don't look for a review from me because all I would have to 
    do is change characters' names, the type of monster and resubmit this 
    review. He also has about ten more films coming out in the near 
    future, so if you see his name attached to any film, you can skip it 
    without feeling guilty. Available streaming on Amazon Prime (free to 
    Prime members) and for free on YouTube, courtesy of channel 
    &quot;Horror Central&quot;.;<A NAME="DollHouse2020"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Talking about multi-hyphenated directors, if the name Steven M. Smith 
    doesn't sound familiar, then you are a lucky one. I recently watched 
    two of his films (He has directed 27 films since 2005!) and decided 
    to review <B><A HREF="doll_house_2020.htm">DOLL HOUSE</A></B> (2020), 
    because the other one, <B><A HREF="doll_cemetery_2019.htm">DOLL CEMETERY</A></B> 
    (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="doll_cemetery_2019.htm#AlfredThe Doll">ALFRED THE DOLL</A></B>;
     <B><A HREF="doll_cemetery_2019.htm#HouseCemeteryHill">THE HOUSE ON 
    CEMETERY HILL</A></B>; and <B>THE SANCTUARY</B> - 2019), is not worth 
    the time it would take to type a single word. Not that this film is 
    any better, but it does have a few WTF?!? moments that are never 
    explained. Emma (Jennifer Leahey), a twenty-something big-breasted 
    woman, runs a house for troubled children. Emma has gone mute due to 
    a traumatic event that happened earlier in her life (it is never 
    explained; if it were, I probably missed it due to the fractured 
    narrative this film offers), so she communicates with everyone by 
    writing on different color Post-It Notes (it would be much better if 
    she did her writing on an eraseable board or on a tablet, but this 
    film is so threadbare, they probably couldn't afford it), which 
    litter the house on all the walls and furniture. When Emma learns of 
    a medium coming to town to put on two shows, she shows up late at the 
    first showing and the medium becomes possessed by an evil spirit that 
    tries to kill Emma (that also is never explained). Emma runs out of 
    the theater and calmly walks home (like nothing even happened), only 
    to be followed by an obese woman who is a journalist. She wants to 
    know why Emma attracts evil spirits, but Emma doesn't reply and hands 
    the fat chick a three ring binder that explains her condition (Emma 
    is nothing but thorough). A new troubled 11-year-old<A HREF="doll_house_2020.htm"><IMG SRC="images/doll house 2020 amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    female child is about to come to the house to live temporarily; a 
    creepy little girl named Ava (Saffia Larter-Green), who is also mute, 
    enters the house holding an even creepier doll. The doll never leaves 
    Ava's possession and goes everywhere Ava goes. A mysterious dollhouse 
    appears in Ava's bedroom and no one seems to know how it got there 
    (yet everyone just decides to ignore it!). It is an exact replica of 
    the house and there are miniature figures inside the dollhouse that 
    are tiny duplicates of the people who live or visit there. Pretty 
    soon people living or visiting the house are murdered by Ava (who 
    looks like a white-faced ghost with blackened eyes) and her doll and 
    disappear, their murders mimicked by their miniatures in the 
    dollhouse. Pretty soon Emma and Ava are the only ones left in the 
    house, as everyone else is dead, and Emma must fight the creepy Ava 
    (who now appears as a demon with glowing laser eyes) for her life. 
    Will Emma defeat the little demon girl? Will Emma get her voice back? 
    Will Emma sell the dollhouse to Director Steven M. Smith in the 
    film's finale? Will Emma expose her breasts so everyone can see them? 
    If you answered yes to all those questions, except for the last one, 
    you would be correct. Yet the film is so confusing and fractured, 
    you'll be scratching your head until your scalp bleeds. Too many 
    things in this film go unexplained, such as a psychiatrist who comes 
    in the house to talk to Ava and tries to get her to talk. He is 
    unsuccessful, but he is then bothered by bloody visions every time he 
    talks to Ava, only to end up murdered in the house's small attic by 
    the possessed Ava. The fat chick journalist returns towards the end 
    of the film to try and help Emma defeat Ava, only to end up murdered, 
    too. The medium also appears during close to the end of the film, but 
    it leads nowhere. As a matter of fact, the film is so confusing, I 
    doubt anyone could give an explanation about what is happening. There 
    are long stretches where nothing happens, such as an extremely long 
    scene of Emma walking home after witnessing the posessed medium 
    trying to kill her, that I doubt even the staunchest of viewers could 
    give a reasonable account about what the hell is going on. There is 
    some blood, but no gore, zero nudity, even when a teenage female 
    resident takes a bath and the photography is flat and uninvolving. 
    The end credits are full of bad jokes for some reason, as if director/producer/screenwriter/editor/sperm
     donor Steven M. Smith knew he made a bad film and tried to cover it 
    up by telling jokes during the end credits. A lot of Smith's previous 
    films concern dolls or small creatures terrorizing the cast, so he 
    can be considered the British version of Charles Band. It's hard to 
    find a film with nothing to recommend, yet I managed to find it. 
    There's nothing here even remotely interesting and I hope you take 
    heed of what I say and avoid this like the Plague. If not, you only 
    have yourself to blame. Available for free on YouTube and Tubi both 
    with commercials. You'll have to pay $1.99 to watch it 
    commercial-free on Prime, even if you are a member, so do yourself a 
    favor and use that money to buy yourself breakfast at BK. You'll 
    enjoy that, unlike this movie.;<A NAME="DetectDiRenjie2020"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <B><A HREF="detection_of_di_renjie_2020.htm">DETECTION OF DI RENJIE</A></B> 
    (2020) is a continuation of the Chinese franchise of Detective Dee 
    fantasy mysteries (also known as <B><A HREF="detection_of_di_renjie_2020.htm">DETECTION
     OF DETECTIVE DEE</A></B>) that have been made in the past twenty 
    years (I reviewed <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm#DetDeePhanFlame2010">DETECTIVE
     DEE AND THE MYSTERY OF THE PHANTOM FLAME</A></B> [2010], directed by 
    Tsui Hark, in this section). This is one of three Detective Dee films 
    released in 2020 and if they are all like this one, they are gorgeous 
    to look at, but they also suffer from a storyline only familiar to 
    those who know Chinese history. Detective Dee (portrayed by Du 
    Yiheng) is a Chinese Sherlock Holmes circa 700A.D. who doesn't 
    believe in the supernatural, saying all crimes can be solved by 
    physical evidence. The crimes here are the drowning death of a 
    Chinese nobleman and the death of a female dancer performing the 
    Dance Of The Fairies in front of an audience. They both died at the 
    exact same time and with smiles on their faces, but since they both 
    died a long distance away from each other, Detective Dee is called in 
    to investigate both cases. He is nearly killed by a female member of 
    the Royal Guard, Xie Yaohuan (Shu Yang), who was also sent to 
    investigate the case since the nobleman who was killed had ties to 
    the <A HREF="detection_of_di_renjie_2020.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("158","212") --><IMG SRC="images/detection of detective dee china poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Royal
     Guard. Xie Yaohuan is an expert swordsman (swordswoman?) and wants 
    to kill everyone she comes in contact with, but Detective Dee is able 
    to calm her down and try to imbue some sense into her (He is also a 
    better swordsman) and they soon grow fond of each other. That's about 
    all I could understand about the film, because it is spoken in 
    Mandarin with the tiniest white English subtitles that are very hard 
    to read, especially in bright sequences. Since Detective Dee doesn't 
    believe in supernatural mumbo-jumbo and finds out why these murders 
    were committed by using his deductive mind and vast knowledge of 
    poisons, it doesn't explain how he can jump high in the air and land 
    on roofs whenever he gets into a fight. That's right, Detective Dee 
    and every baddie he comes in contact with can defy the laws of 
    physics and gravity, flying through the air with the greatest of ease 
    while doing double and triple flips in the air. Every fight scene in 
    this film (and there are many) is enhanced with wire work and CGI 
    (which is ten times better than anything produced in Hollywood), 
    which makes me wonder why the Detective doesn't believe in the 
    supernatural. The confusing storyline, which has something to do with 
    the mass slaughter of a village years before, is not helped by the 
    tiny English subtitles, most of them flashing by so quickly, you 
    never get the chance to read them completely (I was going to pause 
    the film at the times when the subtitles flashed by too quickly, but 
    soon realized it would take me three hours to watch a 90-minute 
    film!). That's not to say that this film is bad, because it isn't, 
    but unless you can get full enjoyment from it, what's the point? 
    There are some scenes that do stand out, though, such as Detective 
    Dee and Xie Yaohuan having to fight a village full of deadly snakes, 
    slicing away at them with their swords until they meet a gigantic two-headed
     snake, which is defeated rather quickly. Another good example is the 
    way Detective Dee explains how a mural could magically appear on a 
    wall (it has to do with poisoned honey and thousands of ants). 
    Director Francis Nam keeps the film moving at a quick pace, letting 
    the story suffer and the action to come quick and furiously (some 
    sequences seem to end rather abruptly, like B-Roll footage was never 
    shot to bridge scenes), while cinematographer Jianhui Zhang gives the 
    film a very slick look, as the rain never seems to stop in this 
    cursed village. Like many Chinese fantasy films, the finale is 
    fatalistic and hardly anyone (except for Detective Dee) survives, 
    leaving the Detective once again alone and loveless (the film ends as 
    we watch Detective Dee wash Xie Yaohuan's corpse for burial). This is 
    definitely an example of style over substance and others may enjoy it 
    for the way it looks, but I still would like some coherent plot to go 
    with the beautiful photography. Am I asking for too much?</FONT></FONT></P>
