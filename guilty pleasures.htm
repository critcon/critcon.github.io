   (1974) -</B> This is one of Andy Milligan's least-seen, but most 
   enjoyable films (it also doesn't hurt that it's a tad under one hour 
   in length). Of course, to enjoy any Andy Milligan flick, you need two 
   things: 1) a tolerance for long-winded dialogue scenes and 2) an 
   understanding of why the homosexual Milligan thought so little of the 
   Catholic Church or its religion (reading Jimmy McDonough's book, <I>&quot;</I></FONT></FONT><I><A HREF="ghastly_one_the_sex_gore_netherworld.htm"><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">T</FONT></FONT></A></I><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><I><A HREF="ghastly_one_the_sex_gore_netherworld.htm">he
    Ghastly One: The Sex-Gore Netherworld Of Filmmaker Andy Milligan</A>&quot;</I> 
   should also be a prerequisite for anyone interested in Andy's films 
   or simply the life of a tortured soul). To me, at least, there's no 
   doubt that Milligan had talent; for no matter how much he prattled-on 
   about his distaste for religion, he at least transported the viewer 
   to some alternate universe where people spoke the Queen's English 
   even in the most extraordinary of circumstances. Watching a Milligan 
   film is akin to stepping in a time machine (anachronisms be damned!) 
   and being transported to an era that only existed in Milligan's 
   twisted mind. <B>BLOOD</B> opens sometime in the late Nineteenth 
   Century, with Dr. Lawrence Orlofski (Allan Berendt) returning to the 
   United States (Staten Island, NY, to be more precise) with his wife 
   Regina (Hope Stansbury), who suffers from a rare blood disorder where 
   exposure to five minutes of sunlight could burn her alive (We see the 
   effects of the sun on her face in the beginning of the film when Dr. 
   Orlofski and his servants fail to bring Regina into the new house in 
   a timely manner. Maybe they should have waited until nightfall. Just 
   a thought.). Regina must be injected weekly with a serum her husband 
   has created to allow her to live a n<A HREF="blood_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/blood 1974 british vhs front small2.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="194" HEIGHT="317" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>ormal
    life. Dr. Orlofski believes that their solicitor, Carl Root (John 
   Wallowitch), may be robbing them blind and plans on confronting him 
   about it in the near future because he needs the family fortune to 
   continue his research. Carrie (Patti Gaul), the good doctor's 
   assistant, is in love with Dr. Orlofski and a practicing Catholic, 
   which pisses-off Regina because she has an aversion to Carrie's 
   crucifix. Carrie also has a bad infection in one of her legs and may 
   have to have it amputated if Dr. Orlofski doesn't cure it soon. 
   Speaking of legs, the Orlofski's butler, Orlando (Michael Fischetti), 
   is missing both of his and gets around in a wheeled cart that he 
   pushes around with his hands. The maid, Carlotta (Pichulina Hempi), 
   is a deaf mute who also must take daily injections in her 
   junkie-scarred arm. As you can probably tell, this is one fucked-up 
   household and to add insult to injury, Orlando and Carrie drain a 
   couple of pints of blood from Carlotta nightly (for use in the 
   doctor's serum) and there are a bunch of man-eating plants in the 
   basement (the doctor uses extracts from the plants for the serum) and 
   they are growing hungrier by the minute (one of them tries to bite 
   Orlando's hand off!). When Dr. Orlofski finally visits Carl Root, he 
   discovers that there is not much money left in the family fortune 
   (Carl has been robbing them blind), but there's not much he can do 
   when Carl threatens to expose the doctor's real last name, Talbot 
   (Larry Talbot? Uh, oh!). When Carrie's brother, Tommy (David Bevans) 
   comes for a visit and sees what a sorry state his sister's leg is in 
   (it turns out that Carrie's leg was another victim of those damned 
   basement plants), he threatens to go to the police, but Regina lures 
   him down to the basement, buries a meat cleaver in his head (a 
   Milligan staple) and dissolves his body in a tub of acid (the bottles 
   have &quot;ACID&quot; crudely written on them with magic marker!). 
   Nosy realtor Mr. Markham (Martin Raymart), who is renting the house 
   to Dr. Orlofski, sneaks into the house and when he is caught snooping 
   around, Orlando knocks him out with a shovel and feeds him to the 
   plants, while Regina chops-off the head of a live mouse (there's 
   really no reason for showing it, but Milligan does) and eats it! Dr. 
   Orlofski gains the trust of Carl's secretary, Prudence (Pamela 
   Towers), they fall in love and she agrees to help him recover papers 
   from Carl's office that will return the family fortune. In a 
   not-so-surprising twist, we discover that Larry is a werewolf, Regina 
   is a vampire and their marriage was pre-arranged in the &quot;Old 
   Country&quot; between the Talbot and the Dracula families! The finale 
   finds a fully transformed Larry battling a dimestore-fanged Regina as 
   the house burns around them. In the Epilogue, the house is restored 
   and is then bought by Baron and Mme. Von Frankenstein! My hand to 
   God!&nbsp; The first thing you'll notice about <B><A HREF="blood_1974b.htm">BLOOD</A></B> 
   is how quickly it moves, which, if you're an Andy Milligan fan like 
   me, is highly unusual. This could be because of the participation of 
   producer Walter Kent (who also has a small role as a man in Carl's 
   office and whose entire movie career seems to be just this film) and 
   not Milligan's usual producers, the legendary William Mishkin 
   (Milligan's <B><A HREF="bloodthirsty_butchers_1970.htm">BLOODTHIRSTY BUTCHERS</A></B>

    RATS ARE COMING! THE WEREWOLVES ARE HERE!</A></B> - 1972) and later, 
   his son, Lew Mishkin (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Carnage">CARNAGE</A></B> 
   - 1983; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Monstrosity 1987">MONSTROSITY</A></B> 
   - 1987), who always &quot;tinkered&quot; with Milligan's finished 
   product. There are some noticeable jump edits here, especially during 
   the film's bloodier scenes (and there are a few, including Johnny's 
   murder, the lancing of Carrie's puss-filled leg, Prudence's 
   neck-biting and the mouse head-eating scene), but those were probably 
   done at the behest of distributor Bryanston Films, a Mob-run business 
   who were notorious for cutting films to their bare minimum for 
   playing on the bottom tier of double and triple features (just look 
   what they did to <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Jack Ripper West">JACK
    THE RIPPER GOES WEST</A></B> [1974] and <B><A HREF="porno horror.htm#Legacy Of Satan">LEGACY
    OF SATAN</A></B> [1972] for further proof). The IMDB lists a running 
   time of 74 minutes, a claim I find highly dubious. Still, this is one 
   of Andy Milligan's most accomplished efforts and Milligan fans (you 
   know who you are) should search it out. Also starring Hazel Wolffs, 
   Joe Downing and Eve Crosby as Petra, an old hag who gets her hands 
   cut off (the sight of her obvious mannequin arms during the aftermath 
   is hilarious). I don't believe this ever received a legitimate home 
   video release in the U.S.; the print I viewed was sourced from the 
   British VHS tape from Iver Film Services (which is supposedly a 
   boot). Now available on a <A HREF="legacy_of_satan_1972_blood_1974_blu-ray.htm">double

   Archives Entertainment</A> who sell it in a 69-minute version. I will 
   report the differences (there's over 10 minutes of footage not seen

   When people ask me how the giallo genre got started, I usually 
   mention this film. While not the first giallo movie, it is the one 
   best remembered, thanks to director/co-screenwriter Mario Bava's (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#FiveDolls1970">FIVE

   - 1977) use of color, sensuality and brutal violence, which was 
   copied by the many giallo films that followed it. Mario Bava was an 
   innovator in many genres and when he passed away (in 1980), it left a 
   large hole in Italian genre cinema, as no one (with the exception of 
   Dario Argento) was able to reproduce his way with a camera (Bava was 
   a cinematographer first and filmed many of the films he directed, 
   including this one) and creating an atmosphere of dread<A HREF="blood_and_black_lace_1964.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/blood and black lace dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="307" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   thick enough to cut with a knife (pun intended).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film begins in a very unusual way, by introducing the actors 
   individually, as they pose motionless next to mannequin counterparts 
   (it really is strange and memorable). We then see model Isabella 
   (Francesca Ungaro) arrive at the Christian Haute Couture agency in 
   the middle of the night, but she never makes it to the front door, as 
   someone dressed in black (with a large black floppy hat) and a 
   stocking over their head strangles her with their black gloved hands 
   and then drags her away. The owner of the agency, Countess Christina 
   Como (Eva Bartok; <B><A HREF="gamma_people_1956.htm">THE GAMMA PEOPLE</A></B> 
   - 1956), tells her partner in the business, Max Marian (a dubbed 
   Cameron Mitchell; Bava's <B><A HREF="knives_of_the_avenger_1966.htm">KNIVES
    OF THE AVENGER</A></B> - 1966), that this is the third time Isabella 
   is late and if she is ever late again, she is fired. There is a big 
   fashion show tomorrow and the Countess is very nervous, yelling at 
   some models for not properly taking care of the clothes they are 
   going to wear tomorrow. We then learn that the Countess recently lost 
   her husband in an automobile accident and she has not been the same 
   since, but is she ready for what happens next? When the Countess 
   opens a closet door, she discovers Isabella's bloody dead body. The 
   police arrive at the scene and Inspector Sylvester (Thomas Reiner; <B><A HREF="three_fantastic_supermen_1967.htm">THREE
    FANTASTIC SUPERMEN</A></B> - 1967) questions everyone at the agency, 
   including the visiting Marquis Richard Morelli (Franco Ressel; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#EyeInTheLabyrinth">EYE
    IN THE LABYRINTH</A></B> - 1972), the boyfriend of model Greta (Lea 
   Krugher; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#AchtungDesertTigers">ACHTUNG! 
   THE DESERT TIGERS</A></B> - 1977), but why does dress designer Cesare 
   Lazzarini (Luciano Pigozzi; <B><A HREF="#Libido1965">LIBIDO</A></B> - 
   1965; who doesn't use his pseudonym &quot;Alan Collins&quot; here, 
   which is a rarity) snicker when Greta tells the Inspector that 
   Richard is her fianc&eacute;? It is obvious that drug use is rampant 
   at the agency, because, earlier in the film, we saw Frank Scalo 
   (Dante Di Paolo; Bava's <B><A HREF="evil_eye_1963.htm">EVIL EYE</A></B> 
   - 1963) telling model Peggy (Mary Arden; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#AForAssassin1966">A</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="thriller.htm#AForAssassin1966">...</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><A HREF="thriller.htm#AForAssassin1966">FOR
    ASSASSIN</A></B> - 1966; she also wrote this film's adaptation as 
   &quot;Kelly Leon&quot;) that Isabella took his &quot;stuff&quot; and 
   he needs some now. We also saw agency employee Marco (Massimo Righi; 
   Bava's <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#PlanetVampires1965">PLANET OF 
   THE VAMPIRES</A></B> - 1965) popping some pills after fixing the 
   agency's sign, which slipped off one of its hinges and was swinging 
   in the breeze. The Inspector is sure he has seen the Countess before 
   and she says it was probably at the scene of her husband's fatal 
   accident, just before she walks away, saying she has some important 
   business to take care of. When the Inspector becomes unrelenting in 
   his questions to Isabella's two roommates, Peggy and Nicole (Arianna 
   Gorini), Cesare interrupts, telling the Inspector that he should talk 
   to Isabella's boyfriend, antique dealer Frank Scalo.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Inspector goes to Frank's antique shop and questions him, but 
   his answers are very elusive (Frank tells him that he doesn't believe 
   in &quot;exclusive&quot; relationships and Isabella was not his 
   girlfriend, just a mere acquaintance), especially when he sees the 
   Inspector holding a small bundle of cocaine. The Inspector asks Frank 
   if he ever saw the cocaine before, telling him a detective found it 
   in Isabella's room. Frank blatantly lies, saying he didn't know 
   Isabella used drugs. It is plain to see that the Inspector knows he 
   is lying, so he leaves, telling a nervous Frank that he will see him later.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At the fashion show at the agency the next day, the Countess can't 
   get any of her models to wear the dress Isabella was supposed to 
   wear, all of them saying that the dress is bad luck, that is until 
   Nicole volunteers to wear it (One of the models says this about 
   Nicole: &quot;She doesn't believe in anything.&quot;). We also see 
   Marco sneak off to pop a couple of pills. When Marco sees Nicole in 
   Isabella's dress, he says something is missing, a brooch. The 
   Countess says that the brooch belonged to Isabella, but she kept it 
   at the agency, so everyone begins going through boxes looking for it. 
   Nicole finds it in one of the boxes, along with Isabella's diary and 
   when she announces what she has just found, everyone stops in their 
   tracks, all of them having worried looks on their faces (Luciano 
   Pigozzi really looks like Peter Lorre here, thanks to Bava's use of 
   shadows and primary color lighting, one of his signature trademarks). 
   Nicole begins reading the diary to herself, saying, &quot;This is 
   gold!&quot; and begins reading it out loud, saying, <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;He
    is a man that awakens such deep feelings in me that, afterwards, I 
   feel limp, empty...&quot;</FONT></B>, but before she can read 
   anything else, Cesare rips it out of her hands and Marco says no one 
   should read it, these are Isabella's innermost private thoughts. The 
   Countess agrees and takes the diary out of Cesare's hands, saying it 
   should be handed over to the police. Nicole asks the Countess for the 
   diary, saying she is the one who found it and she will hand it over 
   to the police tomorrow. Nicole places the diary in her purse, sets it 
   on a table and the walks to the runway to display Isabella's dress to 
   an applauding audience. Everyone stares at the purse while Nicole is 
   on the runway, but no one dares to touch it. When Nicole is done, she 
   makes a phone call to Frank, telling him to come to the agency, she 
   found Isabella's diary and he is mentioned in it. What Nicole doesn't 
   know is someone is standing in the shadows listening to her 
   conversation. Frank tells Nicole he will be right over and if she has 
   &quot;some&quot; (drugs), he will feel better, so they can go through 
   the diary tonight before she hands it over to the police tomorrow.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As Nicole is preparing for her next runway walk, Frank phones her to 
   say he is not coming over because he is sick (&quot;I feel like I am 
   suffocating!&quot;) and tells her to come to his shop immediately. 
   Nicole tells him she will do her best to get there as soon as 
   possible, but she is not done with the fashion show yet, but she will 
   think of something. Nicole tells Peggy that Frank is sick and she 
   needs to go see him right away, asking for the keys to Peggy's car. 
   Peggy gets the keys out of her purse (pay close attention to the 
   purse) and gives them to Nicole, telling her to be careful of the 
   car's burglar alarm. If it goes off, the button to turn it off is 
   located in the back<A HREF="blood_and_black_lace_1964.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/blood and black lace dutch poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   of the glove compartment (Is this important? Damn right it is!). 
   Nicole drives to Frank's antique shop (she activates the car alarm as 
   she gets out), but when Frank doesn't answer the door, she lets 
   herself in (she has a key to the front door). When Frank doesn't 
   answer her shouts out for him, it's apparent he is not there, but the 
   killer is, turning out the lights and chasing Nicole through the shop 
   (wonderfully done, as Bava once again proves to be a master of gel 
   lighting and shadows), ripping off Nicole's dress (quite risqu&eacute;
    for 1964) and killing her by planting a suit of armor's metal claw 
   in her face. The killer escapes in Peggy's car (when the car's alarm 
   goes off, the killer knows where the button is to turn it off) and 
   drives away, unaware that a gas station attendant sees the car 
   speeding away, writing down the car's license plate number.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Peggy gets a ride home and Marco keeps her company until Nicole 
   returns with the car. We then meet Clarissa (Harriette White Medin; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Ghost1963">THE
    GHOST</A></B> - 1963), Isabella, Nicole and Peggy's housekeeper 
   (Bava leads us to believe that she is the killer [she is wearing the 
   same type of clothes as the killer] by filming her from behind as she 
   stokes the fireplace, until Peggy calls out her name and she raises 
   her head). When Clarissa leaves, Marco professes his love to Peggy, 
   but it is easy to see that he is jonesing (maybe he needs a couple of 
   pills?). When he reaches into Peggy's purse for a cigarette, she 
   yells for him to stop. Peggy then gets a phone call from the 
   Inspector, who tells her that her car was found abandoned, asking if 
   it was stolen. Peggy says no, Nicole borrowed it, yet she doesn't 
   tell him that Nicole went to Frank's shop, telling him instead that 
   Nicole went to a sick friend's place to take care of him. Why doesn't 
   she mention Frank's name? I bet you can guess (Remember, Frank 
   doesn't believe in &quot;exclusive&quot; relationships). The 
   Inspector tells Peggy he will be right over, it is best to talk to 
   her in person. Marco excuses himself and leaves, telling Peggy it is 
   best if the police didn't know he was there and Peggy agrees. When 
   Marco leaves, Peggy reaches inside her purse and pulls out Isabella's 
   diary (Remember when I told you to pay attention to Peggy's purse? 
   Well, it's an exact duplicate of Nicole's and Peggy pulled the old 
   switcheroo, giving Nicole her purse). Peggy begins reading the diary 
   and one entry gets her attention: <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;October 
   16: I caught Peggy trying to steal $1</FONT></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT COLOR="NAVY">,</FONT></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">000
    from my purse. She began to cry and explained how much she needed 
   it. She was pregnant and was not able to face the scandal. I felt 
   sorry and I loaned her the money. It means that tomorrow I will ask 
   him for $2</FONT></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT COLOR="NAVY">,</FONT></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">000.&quot;</FONT></B> 
   Peggy rips the pages out of the diary, throws them in the fireplace 
   and watches them burn. Then she throws the entire diary into the fire 
   (it's best to get rid of all the evidence, because the ripped out 
   pages would be easily spotted by the police).&nbsp; She stokes the 
   fireplace to make sure the diary is nothing but ash, when her 
   doorbell rings. Thinking it's the Inspector, she opens the door to 
   discover it is the killer. The killer grabs her and instead of 
   talking, writes down &quot;Where is the diary?&quot; on a pad (pay 
   close attention to the pad). Peggy screams out, &quot;I burned 
   it!&quot;, so the killer checks the fireplace to see if she is 
   telling the truth. Peggy then reaches for the phone, only for the 
   killer to slap and punch her about the face repeatedly until she is 
   unconscious. Hearing the police sirens approaching, the killer 
   carries Peggy's body out of the house just as the Inspector and his 
   men arrive, wondering why Peggy left the front door wide open.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A short time later, Frank arrives at the Marquis' house, where 
   Richard and Greta are having dinner. Frank tells Richard and Greta 
   that he found Nicole dead in his shop and he wants Richard to supply 
   the police with an alibi for him by telling them that he was with 
   Richard and Greta all day. Frank reminds Richard that he saw him at 
   the agency that day when he showed up to meet Nicole, but she wasn't 
   there (proving that the phone call Nicole received at the fashion 
   show was not Frank at all, but the killer pretending to be him). 
   Richard asks Frank why he didn't call the police when he found 
   Nicole's body and he says Nicole was his girlfriend and the police 
   wouldn't believe he didn't kill her, once again begging Richard and 
   Greta to supply him with an alibi. Frank then says to Richard, 
   &quot;You're just as much to blame as I am!&quot;, reminding Richard 
   that he signed an IOU to Isabella for a loan of several thousand 
   dollars, yet he knew he couldn't pay her back because he is flat 
   broke and pretending to be rich, not a penny to his name (Greta asks 
   Richard if it is true and walks away crying). Frank blackmails 
   Richard, saying it is a perfect excuse for killing Isabella, so he 
   better tell the police that he was with him all day, or else he will 
   tell the police about the unpaid loan. Richard can do nothing but 
   agree with Frank's demands, especially when Greta tells Frank that 
   she told Richard about Nicole finding Isabella's diary (Whew!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see Peggy tied-up and blindfolded in some dank basement, 
   where she tells the killer that she burned the diary because it 
   contained some personal information on her that she didn't want made 
   public, but the killer doesn't believe her, slapping her hard on the 
   face several times and then burning her hand on the metal of a 
   red-hot furnace. The killer then finishes her off by pressing her 
   face up against the hot metal furnace. The Inspector arrives at 
   Frank's shop and accuses him of supplying drugs Nicole and the rest 
   of the models. He is also not interested in hearing Frank's (fake) 
   alibi (we then get a close look at Nicole's bloody body as it lies on 
   the floor of Frank's shop).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The Inspector then pulls all the men in to the police station so 
   Clarissa can make an identification. Cesare accuses Marco of being 
   the killer (especially when Clarissa tells the Inspector that he was 
   with Peggy just before she disappeared) and Marco asks for his pills 
   as he collapses to the floor. It turns out he is not a drug addict at 
   all, the pills he was taking are for his epilepsy, so he doesn't have 
   an epileptic fit. The Inspector tells Max and Cesare that any of the 
   men could be the killer, even them, because none of them have alibis 
   that will clear them. The Countess and all her models meet at the 
   agency at 9:00 pm that night. Max then phones the Countess and tells 
   her that all five men, including himself, are being held by the 
   Inspector on suspicion of murder. The models, especially Tao-Li 
   (Claude Dantes; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#HyenaOfLondon1964">THE HYENA 
   OF LONDON</A></B> - 1964), believe that one of the men is the killer, 
   so they will all be safe tonight. Wanna bet? Greta wants to sleep at 
   the agency, but the Countess says no, there is another fashion show 
   here tomorrow, so it is best if she goes to her home in the country 
   and that Tao-Li is correct, she will be safe tonight.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When Greta gets to Richard's mansion, she discovers Peggy's dead 
   body in the trunk of her car. Rather than calling the police, she 
   drags Peggy's lifeless body into the mansion, just after getting a 
   hang-up phone call, doing it quietly so the butler doesn't discover 
   her doing it. The killer then appears and smothers Greta with a 
   pillow. Think you know who the killer is? All the clues are in this 
   review if you read between the lines (when an officer gives all the 
   men back their personal belonging after Greta is murdered, it is very 
   obvious who the killer is, but did they have an accomplice?). We know 
   who isn't the killer, but do you have the chops to know who it is? 
   (Here's an important clue, one I shouldn't have to tell you: The 
   killer only murders beautiful women in a way that destroys their 
   beauty, usually doing it to their faces). Nobody here is clean, as 
   they are either blackmailers, drug addicts or just plain despicable, 
   so finding a killer (or killers) amongst them will prove to be 
   difficult, but not impossible. Do you have what it takes?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    One look at this film and you will instantly understand why Mario 
   Bava was called a master of his craft. This may seem like rehashed 
   giallo tropes by some people, but they must understand that back in 
   1964 there was nothing quite like this film, it was totally original 
   in its concept and execution, which is why it was copied and expanded 
   upon in the years to follow, adding full frontal female nudity and 
   quite graphic violence into the mix, but there is no doubt that this 
   film is the granddaddy of all giallo flicks. It supplied the <A HREF="blood_and_black_lace_1964.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/blood and black lace italy poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="220" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>blueprints
    for giallo films to come (i.e. the killer dressed in black; the 
   killer's POV; plenty of red herrings; etc.). This is the film to 
   thank if you are a fan of giallo films. From the unusual opening, 
   Bava's use of color and shadows, some pretty brutal violence, to the 
   twisty mystery (co-written by Bava and Marcello Fondato [<B><A HREF="uncle_was_a_vampire_1959.htm">UNCLE
    WAS A VAMPIRE</A></B> - 1959]), it is clear why Bava is adored by 
   people who understand what makes films like this so special. There 
   was no one quite like Bava, although many tried, some making a name 
   for themselves (Dario Argento; Sergio Martino) and some failing 
   spectacularly (Riccardo Freda and Ruggero Deodato are good examples, 
   as is Bava's son, Lamberto Bava, who tried to follow in his father's 
   footsteps, but mostly came up snake-eyes). This is the giallo film 
   that every fan should watch, if only to see how the genre got its 
   start, but this is a great film when viewed on its own.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Summer of 1974, sex is running rampant (Ted Raimi puts in a cameo as 
   a condom salesman in the drive-in's mens room) and even Maddie 
   (Louise Lasser; <B><A HREF="slither_1973.htm">SLITHER</A></B> - 
   1973), the divorced mother of identical twins Todd and Terry (who are 
   sleeping in the back seat), wants a little lovin' from her new 
   boyfriend. The twin boys wake up and sneak out of the car while Mom 
   is necking and Terry picks up a hatchet,&nbsp; walks a few cars away, 
   whacks a necking guy about the face until it is nothing but a bloody 
   pulp and then gives the hatchet to Todd, wipes the dead guy's blood 
   on his face and screams for Mommy to look what Todd has done. Todd is 
   committed to a mental institution and ten years pass. Todd's 
   psychiatrist, Dr. Berman (Producer Marianne Kanter), informs Maddie 
   that Todd's memory has come back and he remembers Terry committing 
   the murder. Maddie, of course, doesn't believe Todd (Mark Soper; <B><A HREF="understudy_graveyard_shift_2_1988.htm">THE
    UNDERSTUDY: GRAVEYARD SHIFT II</A></B> - 1988) and continues to 
   treat him like a child, while Terry (Soper again) is seemingly living 
   the normal life of a teenager. While Dr. Berman tries to free Todd 
   from the institution, Maddie announces over dinner that she is 
   marrying her long-time fianc&eacute; Brad (Bill Fuller), the manager 
   of the Shadow Woods apartment complex they live in, which upsets 
   Terry, but he hides it with a fake smile. Todd escapes from the 
   institution before Dr. Berman can legally release him and soon the 
   murders begin. Dr. Berman shows up at Shadow Woods with her assistant 
   Jackie (Doug Weisner) and a tranquilizer pistol and begin their 
   search for Todd, while Terry (or is it Todd?) walks into Brad's 
   office and cuts off his hand with a machete. Todd/Terry make Jackie 
   the next victim by running him through with the machete. Dr. Berman 
   is next on the list when she is cut in two at her waist. Wouldn't you 
   know it, Terry's virgin girlfriend, Karen (Julie Gordon; <B><A HREF="super_fuzz_1980.htm">SUPER
    FUZZ</A></B> - 1980), decides tonight's the night she wants to pop 
   her cherry, but she asks Todd instead, who is more than happy to 
   oblige, but Karen figures out who he is before he can get in her 
   panties. It all ends in a bloody mess of mistaken identities, as 
   Terry goes about killing everyone in sight (he's a virgin, too, but 
   he only has eyes for Mommy!) and, once again, blaming Todd for it 
   all. Will Mother set everything right?&nbsp; There is not much that 
   is surprising story-wise in <B>BLOOD RAGE</B>, but director John M. 
   Grissmer (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Scalpel">SCALPEL</A></B> -

   - 1982, who takes the pseudonym &quot;Richard Lamden&quot; here) 
   offer so many gory deaths and unusual character traits, it's hard not 
   to get involved in the goings-on. Louise Lasser is her usual nutso 
   neurotic self. When she is not drinking heavily, she can be found 
   sitting on the kitchen floor in front of an open refrigerator, 
   pigging out on whatever is available or vacuuming the house while 
   soused. There's a long sequence where an intoxicated Maddie tries to 
   call Brad (who is already dead) on the phone and she gives the 
   operator a hard time or keeps dialing the wrong number. I'm flummoxed 
   why this sequence is even i<A HREF="nightmare_at_shadow_woods_1984.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/nightmare at shadow woods ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="338" HEIGHT="191" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>n
    the movie at all, when all Maddie has to do is walk a couple of door 
   down to Brad's office, which she ends up doing in the finale. Maybe 
   it was in Ms. Lasser's contract that she needed more screen time and 
   this is what Bruce Rubin came up with. But it's the gore on display 
   that will make you sit up and take notice. The sexually repressed 
   Terry kills without mercy, whether it's decapitating neighbor Julie's 
   (Jayne Bentzen) sugar daddy and hanging his head at her front door; 
   cutting off Brad's hand and positioning his head on the stump; 
   cutting Dr. Berman in two so that she can watch her legs twitching 
   before she dies; slicing-up Gregg (Chad Montgomery) and Andrea (Lisa 
   Randall) while they are making love on the pool's diving board; 
   shoving a barbeque fork into Artie's (James Farrell) neck; Karen 
   discovering Terry stabbing Julia in the chest with a machete, before 
   Karen grabs Julia's baby and makes a mad dash for their lives; Maddie 
   discovering Brad's posed body and then discovering that his head was 
   cleaved in two; and the frantic finale, where Maddie puts an end to 
   the horror at the apartment complex's indoor pool and then commits 
   suicide when she realizes she killed the wrong son! (In the <B>NIGHTMARE</B> 
   version, she doesn't commit suicide). Add copious amounts of nudity 
   and a twisted sense of humor (although Mark Soper is weak as an 
   actor) and most horror fans will probably have a good time with this.

   young daughter, Carol (Rosa Rodriguez; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#KnifeOfIce1972">KNIFE

   - 1973), the Butler, tells Susan that Carol is only twelve, she likes 
   to pretend she is older. Susan then asks Carol if she likes school 
   and she says yes, but her teacher recently died. The Housekeeper 
   tells Susan that she died in a car accident, Carol is still very 
   upset about it and she's starting with a new teacher tomorrow. Susan 
   asks if she was fond of her teacher and Carol shakes her head yes. 
   Andreu (which I will call him in this review since he doesn't have a 
   proper name. Will it be revealed later?) says he hasn't been to his 
   family castle in many years, telling Carol the last time he saw her 
   she was just a baby. As the Housekeeper shows Susan to her room, her 
   wedding veil gets snagged on a miniature cannon on the floor. Is this 
   a portend of things to come?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As Andreu tells the Housekeeper, &quot;It's been a long journey. And 
   full of exciting events&quot;, Susan looks out the window of the 
   master bedroom and sees a strange woman in a wedding gown with a 
   shawl pulled over her head walking away. We then find out Susan is a 
   virgin, Andreu saying to her, &quot;We should have made love 
   before.&quot; Susan shoots back with, &quot;You never asked me!&quot; 
   He asks Susan if he should turn around while she undresses or should 
   he undress her? &quot;Whatever you like&quot;, replies Susan, so he 
   rips her wedding dress off her body, revealing it was him who raped 
   her back at the hotel (It's not much of a surprise since Andreu has a 
   very prominent nose, one that cannot be hidden with a stocking pulled 
   over his head). Susan screams in terror and Andreu tells her to be 
   quiet or the servants will hear her. Susan then sits on the bed and 
   gives herself freely to her husband, like any obedient wife should 
   (if you are a sandwich short of a picnic, that is!). Andreu then rips 
   off her bra and panties and does the dirty, Susan with a look on her 
   face as if to say, &quot;What have I gotten into?&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next Morning, Andreu wakes up Susan and says, &quot;Sweet 
   morning. You lived through your wedding night.&quot; Susan says to 
   him, &quot;This isn't the first time you've been with a woman&quot;, 
   and he doesn't deny it, Susan saying it doesn't matter because he was 
   good, very good! She asks him how she was and all he has to say is 
   &quot;great&quot;, but he doesn't say it convincingly. He licks her 
   navel and makes her laugh, which the Butler hears and smiles. They 
   spend the whole day in the bedroom, the Housekeeper leaving their 
   meals by the bedroom door. We then discover Susan is an artist, 
   drawing a portrait of her husband. Everything seems happy and 
   peaceful for the newlyweds, as they make love nearly everywhere in 
   and around the castle (Carol listen to them making love while she is 
   feeding the many captive pigeons that are kept in a large walk-in 
   cage). Andreu shows his true colors when he goes fox hunting with the 
   Butler. A female fox has been caught in one of the traps and instead 
   of letting it free and giving it a chance to live, he puts both 
   barrels of his shotgun into the fox at point blank range. I wonder 
   what he would have done if it were a male fox?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Susan begins to notice all the portraits of her husband's male 
   ancestors hanging on the castle walls and particularly takes notice 
   that many of them died at an early age. She asks Carol if she knows 
   who any of them are and she says no, it's not allowed to talk about 
   them. Susan wonders why there are no portraits of women hanging on 
   the walls and carol Tells her that they are downstairs, in the cellar 
   (I don't know about you, but I'm getting a distinct feeling that it 
   is not safe being a woman in this unnamed family. It would be so much 
   better if this family had a proper fucking name, but something also 
   tells me there is a reason for that!). Susan asks her husband why all 
   the women's portraits are in the cellar and he says he doesn't know, 
   he didn't put them there. Susan doesn't want to hear it, demanding 
   that the portraits be &quot;rescued&quot;, brought upstairs and hung 
   next to their male counterparts. Andreu's answer is to scoop Susan up 
   in his arms, carry her to the bedroom and boink her, which she 
   doesn't seem to mind.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Susan in the woods, shouting out, &quot;It's me! Can you 
   hear me?&quot; We then see the woman with the shawl, whom Susan calls 
   &quot;The Bride.&quot; Andreu suddenly appears behind Susan and when 
   she asks him if he saw The Bride, his answer is to lift her up by her 
   hair and then forcing her to give him oral sex! Before he can finish, 
   Susan breaks free (spitting and wiping her mouth with her hand, 
   leaving no doubt to what had just transpired) and runs away, Andreu 
   calling for her, saying, &quot;Come on. Don't be silly!&quot; (like 
   forced oral sex isn't rape!). We then see (in a sequence that makes 
   no sense at all) some naked male legs walk into the bathroom and get 
   into the bathtub, where Susan is taking a bubble bath. Susan looks up 
   and says, &quot;Oh, no, please&quot;, as if this has happened before. 
   Andreu then begins calling for Susan, so she runs into the pigeon 
   cage and locks herself in. Andreu tells Susan to open the door, but 
   she then takes her hair ribbon, ties the cage's key to it, attached 
   it to a pigeon and lets it fly into the wild. Andreu gets so angry 
   she did this that he kicks the cage's door open. If you are looking 
   for answers from me, I'm afraid I am as in the dark as you are, but I 
   hope this film tries to explain half of the story's many confusing 
   scenes. It turns out that this scene does have an explanation. Susan 
   is teasing her husband so he will make love to her in the pigeon cage 
   (yeech!). He begins to, but then Carol appears to feed the pigeons 
   and the &quot;romantic moment&quot; is lost.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While Susan is painting Carol's portrait, she tells Susan that her 
   husband put all the women's portrait in the cellar; her mother told 
   her he did. She also tells Susan that her husband's grandfather 
   discovered that his newest bride was trying to poison him and she ran 
   away to Paris to get away from his abusive behavior. When Susan asks 
   Carol if her mother also told her that, Carol replies, &quot;No, at 
   school I heard that. Everybody knows about it!&quot; Susan says it is 
   nothing but wild stories, but Carol says it's all true and that's the 
   reason all the women's portraits were taken down and put in the 
   cellar. Carol then says, I think you like it when he hurts you&quot;, 
   but Susan tells her, &quot;Nobody hurts me&quot; and then hands Carol 
   her portrait. Carol acts disappointed, asking, &quot;Is that how I 
   look?&quot; Susan says she's even prettier than the portrait and then 
   asks Carol if she has seen the women's portraits in the cellar. Carol 
   says yes, she has seen them, so Susan grabs a flashlight and heads to 
   the cellar, looking at the portraits. Nearly all of the portraits are 
   of women who can politely be called homely, but one portrait gets her 
   attention. It is that of a beautiful woman holding a dagger and when 
   she looks at the nameplate, it reads &quot;Mircala Karstein&quot;. 
   But wait, is that dried blood streaming down the portrait or was it 
   painted that way? (There is also a fairly shocking jump scare during 
   this time.) When Susan looks at the portrait again, it has Carol's 
   face, Carol revealing that Mircala's portrait had her face cut out, 
   but why? Susan laughs at the funny faces Carol makes, but the 
   laughter quickly stops when Andreu grabs Susan's shoulder and shines 
   his flashlight in her face. He looks at the portrait and says, 
   &quot;Do you know who she was? If you knew, you wouldn't laugh.&quot; 
   He tells Susan to come with him and he will tell her all about 
   Mircala Karstein. He takes Susan to the family crypt, which is in 
   ruins, pieces of stone architecture piled up in the middle, forming a 
   small mountain of rock and rubble. He then shows her Mircala 
   Karstein's tomb, where he kicks it and it produces a hollow sound, as 
   if it were empty. Susan asks if this is really Mircala Karstein's 
   tomb and Andreu replies, &quot;I suppose so.&quot; She then asks if 
   Mircala belonged to his family and he replies, &quot;Yeah, in a 
   way.&quot; (For someone who promised to tell Susan all about Mircala, 
   Andreu's answers are very evasive, aren't they?). &quot;But your name 
   isn't Karstein&quot;, says Susan, her husband answering that it was 
   her maiden name and she didn't have time to change it (To WHAT for 
   Christ's sake? For crying out loud what is your fucking family name? 
   I'll even accept a nickname at this point!). Andreu tells Susan that 
   Mircala didn't have time to change her name because she killed her 
   husband, his grandfather, on their wedding night. Susan walks away 
   and her husband says that, according to legend, it was because her 
   husband tried to make her do &quot;unspeakable&quot; things (I guess 
   it runs in the family). When Susan asks what unspeakable things, 
   Andreu replies, &quot;Nobody knows&quot; because it was omitted 
   prudishly from family records, which is a shame, because &quot;it 
   would be the most amusing part of the story.&quot; Susan asks how 
   Mircala died and her husband says she didn't die, she was found 
   spattered with blood while still wearing her wedding dress, next to 
   the dead body of her husband. Her eyes were wide open and rigid, with 
   warmth and color in her body. &quot;They waited for two years before 
   they decided to bury her, but they never managed to take the dagger 
   out of her hand, burying it with her. You see, even though Mircala 
   was clinically dead and she had no pulse, her body didn't begin to 
   decompose, so they buried her and wiped her memory from the family 
   records.&quot; (Which would explain why her face was removed from her 
   portrait). I wouldn't be giving anything away by telling you that 
   &quot;The Bride&quot; is actually Mircala Karstein (Alexandra 
   Bastedo; <B><A HREF="i_hate_my_body_1974.htm">I HATE MY BODY</A></B> 
   - 1974) and if you know anything about Sheridan Le Fanu's story 
   &quot;Carmilla&quot;, you know that she is a lesbian vampire. Since 
   what I have explained to you happens in the first thirty minutes, 
   allow me to summarize what happens next before this turns into a

    This is a sexy, gory trip into Spanish Gothic horror, punctuated by 
   graphic bits of bloodletting (much of it involving the dagger) and 
   crammed with full-frontal female nudity. Director/screenwriter 
   Vicente Aranda (<B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Left-HandedFate1966">LEFT-HANDED
    FATE</A></B> - 1966; <B><A HREF="exquisite_cadaver_1969.htm">THE 
   EXQUISITE CADAVER</A></B> - 1969) has adapted Sheridan Le Fanu's 
   story (Changing the names slightly from &quot;Carmilla Karnstein&quot;
    to Carmila Karstein&quot; to avoid legal copyright laws), pre-dating 
   Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot; by twenty years, and placed it in 
   modern times, but there are many Gothic moments, including Andreu's 
   rather large and creepy castle<A HREF="blood_spattered_bride_1972_foreign_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/blood spattered bride spain poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>,
    as well as the stone edifices surrounding it (including the decrepit 
   family crypt) and the dark and dank cellar, placing it in the ranks 
   of some of the best Italian Gothic horror films of the '60s. It is 
   the nudity and sex, however, which makes this film so surprising. I 
   remember <A HREF="blood_spattered_bride_1972.htm#TVGuideAd">watching 
   this film on TV</A> in the late-'70s and not being impressed, because 
   all the nudity, sex and extreme violence were edited out, making the 
   film nothing but a shell of its former self. Simon Andreu is no 
   stranger to the genre, starring in <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Night Of Sorcerers">NIGHT
    OF THE SORCERERS</A></B> (1973), as well as many giallo flicks, 
   including <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#ForbiddenPhotos1970">THE FORBIDDEN 
   PHOTOS OF A LADY ABOVE SUSPICION</A></B> (1970), <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#DeathWalksHeels1971">DEATH

    OF CRYSTAL</A></B> (2004). He is still acting up to this day. Be 
   aware that this is a slow-moving film, yet it is never boring, thanks 
   to Aranda's keen eye for the little things, which will eventually 
   later morph into things very important to advance the plot (Mircala's 
   face being removed from her portrait being one of those &quot;little 
   things&quot;). This is a film that demands all of your attention, so 
   if you plan on cutting your toenails when watching this, I would 
   advise you not to because you're likely to miss some important info. 
   While I wouldn't go as far as to call it a classic of the Gothic 
   horror genre, this is still a quite enjoyable and eye-opening foray 
   into sex and violence, sometimes within the same scene, making this 
   the perfect film to watch on a rainy night with all the lights out. 
   Are you brave enough to watch it under these conditions?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    MELT</A><A NAME="BodyMelt1993"></A> (1993) -</B> I'm a sucker for 
   Australian horror films. They just have that something 
   &quot;extra&quot; that is missing from most American horror films. 
   This one is no different, even though it is basically nothing but a 
   gore comedy with the thinnest of plots. It's a beautiful day in the 
   cul-de-sac of Pebble's Court in the town of Homesville. Everyone is 
   doing their morning thing like jogging, going to work or wise-ass 
   kids telling jokes (&quot;Want to hear a joke?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Elton
    John!&quot;). That peacefulness and tranquility will soon be broken 
   and in one of the worst ways possible. You see, Pebble's Court is 
   being used by a pharmaceutical company to test out its newest dietary 
   supplement &quot;Vimuville&quot; and the side effects are killer. A 
   traitorous pharmacy representative drives towards Pebble's Court to 
   tell them what is going on, but by the looks of him, he's not doing 
   very well. Pharmacy executive Shaan (Regina Gaigalas) assures 
   Pebble's Court's doctor, Dr. Carrera (Vincent Gil), who knows all 
   about the trials and is keeping a personal track of Vimuville's 
   progress, that the man will never make it to Pebble's Court and, even 
   if he does, he will be too far gone to say anything. We then see the 
   man stopping at a gas station store and asking the counterman where 
   the detergent is. He then proceeds to drink an entire bottle of 
   dishwashing detergent as his neck begins to split open. He throws the 
   counterman his credit card and drives <A HREF="body_melt_1993.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/body melt reverse cover dvd3 front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="209" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>off,
    where he is chased by police. The man talks into a mini-recorder, 
   where he says the following things: &quot;Stage 1: 
   Hallucinations&nbsp; Stage 2: Organ Failure&nbsp; Stage 3: Body 
   Melt&quot; before crashing into a van in the cul-de-sac, his body 
   flying through the windshield. We then see tentacles come out of the 
   man's throat wounds and enter his mouth, but they quickly retreat 
   when the police get closer. Detective Sam Phillips (Gerard Kennedy; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Panic Station">PANIC
    STATION</A></B> - 1982; <B><A HREF="wolf_creek_2_2013.htm">WOLF 
   CREEK 2</A></B> - 2013) and his partner Johnno (Andrew Daddo) are put 
   in charge of the case and Sam finds the mini-recorder and plays it, 
   but doesn't understand what it means...yet (Johnno is mainly around 
   for comedy relief). The two wise-ass kids, Gino (Maurice Annese) and 
   Sal (Nick Polites) ask Sam if it is OK if they leave town to go get 
   laid and Sam says yes, so the stupid pair end up at some strange 
   establishment where everyone looks inbred (and they even have a 
   three-legged dog). Meanwhile, a man from Pebble's Court goes to the 
   airport and keeps on seeing women who aren't really there (Stage 1). 
   He then imagines that one woman in an airport hotel room removes one 
   of his ribs because it will complete her collection of 13 men's ribs 
   (we see her massage his chest and then pull the rib out of his body). 
   Sal gets lucky with one of the inbred daughters (who looks like a man 
   dressed as a woman), only to get a pitchfork impaled into his crotch 
   while they are making love in a chicken coop. Gino tries to get away 
   by stealing the family's truck, but all it does is drive around in 
   circles (!) and he is quickly surrounded and killed by the inbred 
   family. What does this have to do with the rest of the film? Read on. 
   Sam finds the Vimuville bottle in the man's car, so he and Johnno go 
   to the pharmaceutical company, where they get nothing but the company 
   line by Shaan. Sam finds that highly suspicious. As more and more 
   free samples of Vimuville are delivered to everyone in Pebble's Court 
   by mail, things begin to get weirder and weirder. Dr. Carrera begs 
   Shaan to step down the dosages of Vimuville, especially on the 
   pregnant Cheryl Rand (Lisa McCune), but Shaan step-ups the experiment 
   because she has outside investors interested in the supplement. 
   Cheryl lies on a bed and her stomach explodes and tentacles shoot out 
   her stomach and vagina (but no baby) and hit her husband Brian (Brett 
   Climo) in the face (Stage 2). Brian is taken away by the police and 
   charged with Cheryl's murder, but Sam believes there is something 
   fishy going on. The residents of Pebble's court begin experiencing 
   body changes and none of them are good. Thompson Noble (Adrian 
   Wright) begins to shoot so much snot out of his nose, he slips on it 
   and kills himself by hitting his head on the sharp edge of a bathroom 
   counter. His son Brandon (Ben Guerens) is rollerblading on a 
   skateboarding ramp and tries a fancy move, only to fall on his face 
   where all the skin on his face falls off (all we see are teeth 
   without lips). Dr Carrera kills a man with a hypo shot, but not 
   before he rips off the doctor's ear. When Sam and Johnno find the 
   dead man, the ear has grown on the dead man's palm (It gives a whole 
   new meaning to &quot;Talk to the hand!&quot;). An earless Dr. Carrera 
   goes to the inbred establishment, where we find out that the father 
   is actually Dr. Carrera's brother and he use to work in the 
   pharmaceutical company's laboratory and has developed and antidote 
   which he took with him (it still makes absolutely no sense why the 
   entire family is inbred). One muscular guy chokes his girlfriend to 
   death while they are making love as we watch his back split wide 
   open. Another guy's penis explodes and splatters all over a TV screen 
   (We see his erection through his shorts and then the bloody deed). 
   When Thompson Noble's wife Angelica (Jillian Murphy) sees that her 
   husband's body is literally encased in snot, she grabs her daughter 
   Elloise (Amanda Douge) and leaves the house (after witnessing 
   Elloise's boyfriend's head implode inside his body!). They drive to a 
   doctor's office and Angelica's tongue swells to about two feet long 
   and she chokes to death. The doctor says that Pebble's Court was 
   built over a chemical dump over twenty tears ago and that, mixed with 
   Vimuville, have caused all these strange deaths. Dr. Carrera goes to 
   kill Shaan, but finds out she has dissolved into a pile of goo (Stage 
   3). Sam and Johnno shut down the pharmaceutical company and save the 
   day, but as the final shot shows us, Vimuville is already on grocery 
   store shelves.&nbsp; This Australian gore comedy (which walks the 
   fine line between hard R-Rated and NC-17 territory, including a full 
   view of a dead man's penis on the coroner's table) is the only 
   directorial effort by Philip Brophy, who also wrote and mixed the 
   music, co-wrote the screenplay (with co-producer Rod Bishop), drew 
   all the storyboards and was sound designer. While the film doesn't 
   add up to much in the logic department for its 82-minute running 
   time, it will satisfy those looking for goofy, gory deaths (supplied 
   by Bob McCarron), with no CGI in sight. Just good, old bladder 
   effects, exploding body parts (the pregnancy death is a standout) and 
   lots of dripping goo and tentacles (Which are not explained. Are they 
   a new life form or just a side effect of Vimuville? I also believe 
   some of the deaths were edited to get an R-Rating, especially the 
   pitchfork scene.). Add a good sense of humor, put your brain in 
   neutral and just go for the ride. It is what it is. Nothing more. 
   Nothing less. Also starring Neil Foley, Anthea Davis, Matthew Newton, 
   Lesley Baker, Amy Grove-Rogers and Suzi Doughtery. Originally

   mathematics and astronomy. But one day, in the year 607 AD, this 
   people emigrated en masse towards the distant, wild north, abandoning 
   the sturdy dwellings, the pyramids and the temples they had built. 
   None of the Maya came back. The cities remained deserted and the 
   jungle slowly swallowed the streets and buildings, erasing<A HREF="caltiki_the_immortal_monster_1959.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/caltiki the immortal monster blu-ray front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="263" HEIGHT="308" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   every trace of their civilization. The scientific expeditions that 
   tried to shed light on these events were never able to provide a 
   satisfactory explanation. Some believe there was an enemy invasion, 
   but what powers at that time could have defeated the Mayan people? 
   There are no signs of natural disasters and what catastrophe could 
   have force a people to build a new kingdom, abandoning the land where 
   that had always lived? The mystery still remains today and the 
   nomadic Indians who travel across the region speak of how their 
   ancestors fled the land to escape the wrath of a terrible goddess, a 
   bloodthirsty goddess</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">...</FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B>Caltiki!&quot;</B></FONT></FONT><BR>

    So begins a film that scared the crap out of me when I was a child 
   (giving me nightmares for days), watching it on TV's &quot;Chiller 
   Theatre&quot; in the early-to-mid-'60s. I wanted to return to this 
   film for the longest time to see if my memory wasn't playing tricks 
   on me (Childhood memories can be disappointing when unmasked by an 
   adult brain), but this film was harder to find than the truth at a 
   Republican Party convention (No more politics, I promise). Thanks to <A HREF="http://www.arrowvideo.com">Arrow
    Video</A>, who released this film in a DVD/Blu-Ray combo pack, 
   giving it the respect it deserves (some may think the behind the 
   scenes stories are be more interesting than the film itself, but 
   there's no denying that this film is important on many levels), I can 
   finally see it the way it was meant to be seen, for the very first 
   time. While this Italy/USA co-production may be considered a 
   knock-off of the original <B><A HREF="blob_1958.htm">THE BLOB</A></B> 
   (1958), I would say that this is the better of the two films, even if 
   it lacks that film's color scheme (it's in black &amp; white, but I 
   love black &amp; white films). The cinematography (by Mario Bava, as 
   &quot;John Foam&quot;, but more on him later) is second to none and 
   the scares are here in spades. I would go as far as to say that this 
   film was way ahead of its time, as no 1950's horror film has its 
   mood, atmosphere and sense of style. I'm not trying to put this film 
   on a pedestal (even though it deserves to be), I'm just saying that 
   this is one of the few films that didn't disappoint me in the 50+ 
   years since I last saw it. It is actually better than I remembered it.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    After a volcano eruption in the lost city of Tikal, expedition 
   member Nieto (Arturo Dominici, as &quot;Arthur Dominick&quot;; <B><A HREF="castle_of_blood_1964.htm">CASTLE
    OF BLOOD</A></B> - 1964) stumbles back to base camp, a pistol in his 
   hand, and collapses in the tent of Professor John Fielding (John 
   Merivale; <B><A HREF="circus_of_horrors_1960.htm">CIRCUS OF HORRORS</A> </B>-
    1960) and his wife Ellen (Didi Sullivan). It seems Nieto is the only 
   surviving member of an expedition trying to find out what happened to 
   the Mayan people by exploring the rubble of Tikal, but he is unable 
   to tell anyone what happened because he is in a state of shock. When 
   John examines Nieto's pistol, he tells his associate and friend, Max 
   Gunther (Gerard Haeter; <B><A HREF="secret_agent_super_dragon_1966.htm">SECRET
    AGENT SUPER DRAGON</A></B> - 1966), that it is empty, no bullets in 
   it. Max wonders where the bullets went, since the area Nieto and his 
   group were exploring is completely deserted. When the Professor says 
   they will have to go to the Tikal cave to see what happened to their 
   friend Ulmer (Daniele Pitani), Nieto springs up from his bed and 
   screams, &quot;Ulmer...The Mummy...The 
   Mummy...Caltiki...Caltiki...Caltiki!!!&quot; and then falls back into 
   bed, unconscious. Max says that Caltiki is a Mayan deity, so John, 
   Max, Bob (Daniele Vargas; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Eyeball1975">EYEBALL</A></B> 
   - 1975) and the rest of the group leave for the Tikal cave, leaving 
   Ellen and Linda (Daniela Rocca; <B><A HREF="giant_of_marathon_1959.htm">THE
    GIANT OF MARATHON</A></B> - 1959) behind to take care of Nieto. Once 
   in the cave, everyone yells out Ulmer's name, but no one 
   answers.&nbsp; They find a new opening inside the cave, which John 
   says must have been caused by the volcanic eruption. They see 
   footprints leading into the opening and, thinking they are Ulmer's, 
   they follow them, but not before taking a Geiger counter with them, 
   just to be on the safe side. Once inside the opening, they discover 
   ancient stone steps, which lead them to an undiscovered temple, where 
   an enormous statue of the goddess Caltiki stands guard. They all 
   think they have made an amazing discovery, but they ain't seen 
   nothing yet. The Geiger counter then begins registering high doses of 
   radioactivity, the needle going to maximum. What could be causing 
   such high radioactivity? John and Max think it is coming from the 
   water, a &quot;sacred lake&quot; next to the temple where priests use 
   to drown their victims they sacrificed to their goddess Caltiki, but 
   it is actually coming from something far more deadly. They find 
   Ulmer's movie camera next to the lake, thinking that Ulmer must have 
   drowned, so they go back to base camp to get their scuba gear so they 
   can explore the bottom of the lake, not seeing Ulmer's desiccated 
   corpse on the other side of the lake as they leave.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Once back at base camp, John and Max discover that Nieto has gotten 
   worse. Bob has developed the film in Ulmer's movie camera, so they 
   all sit down to watch the footage. They watch Nieto and Ulmer 
   entering the area in the cave that they were just in, as Nieto finds 
   an ancient bracelet, holding it up for the camera. Suddenly, the 
   camera starts shaking and a visibly shaken Nieto pulls out his pistol 
   and begins firing, then the footage ends. Ellen wants to go back to 
   Mexico City immediately, fearing for her and everyone's lives, but 
   John says no, they have to go back to the caves to save Ulmer, if he 
   is still alive. John then goes to watch an Indian girl (Gay Pearl) 
   dance in an ancient ritual, while Max tries to comfort Ellen, telling 
   her that John is acting like a fool (Max has the hots for Ellen, but 
   she is not interested).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Back at the sacred lake, Bob puts on a wetsuit and scuba gear, 
   diving to the bottom of the lake, discovering numerous human bones, 
   as well as a wealth of gold and ancient pre-Columbian treasures. When 
   Bob exits the lake, he tells everyone they are rich beyond their 
   wildest dreams. All they have to do is dive to the bottom and collect 
   all the ancient gold and jewels below. John doesn't want Bob to put 
   his life in danger, but he insists, diving to the bottom and 
   collecting as much gold and jewelry as he can fit into a cloth bag. 
   Then something attacks Bob and when John and Max pull him up by the 
   rope attached to his waist, they find that Bob's head is nothing but 
   a skull covered in some gelatinous substance (yet his body is still 
   breathing!). The lake starts bubbling and all their native guides run 
   away in fear, as a massive blob arises from the lake and heads 
   towards John and Max. They run up the ancient stone steps, when Max 
   realizes that they left the bag with the jewels and gold next to the 
   lake. Greed gets hold of Max and he will pay for it, as when he goes 
   to retrieve the bag, the blob encases his right arm, but John cuts 
   off the piece of blob that has Max's arm and they escape, but not 
   before John kills the massive blob by driving a truck full of 
   gasoline drums into the cave, jumping out just before the truck 
   explodes, burning the blob to a crisp, killing it. But, if there is 
   one thing we know about blobs, it is that you must destroy 100% of 
   it, leaving no pieces of it alive and letting it grow exponentially.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    John cuts the piece of the blob from Max's arm and puts it in a 
   glass container. John becomes famous in scientific circles, holding 
   conferences all over the world, displaying his new discovery. His 
   piece of the blob is stored at his laboratory in his home, where 
   Ellen and their young daughter live. John tells Ellen that Max is in 
   serious condition (the right side of his body, including his face is 
   eaten away, like he was splashed with acid), John telling her that 
   Max's life depends on him figuring out what makes this new life form 
   tick. If he can figure it out, he may be able to reverse Max's 
   condition (a doctor at the hospital Max is in tells John that Max is 
   beginning to go insane). John gets the idea that radioactivity from 
   the volcanic eruption may have given life to the long-dormant blob, 
   so he contacts Professor Rodriguez (Vittorio Andre; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DeathLaidAnEgg1968">DEATH
    LAID AN EGG</A></B> - 1968) and asks if he can use his 
   &quot;Betatron&quot;, to bombard the blob with electrons, hoping it 
   will somehow lead to reversing Max's condition (The hows and whys are 
   never explained). John brings a piece of his piece of the blob to 
   Professor Rodriguez's laboratory, where the Professor's nameless 
   assistant (a young Giacomo Rossi Stuart; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#NightEvelynGrave71">THE
    NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE</A></B> - 1971) bombards it with 
   electrons. It seemingly works, but there is a more pressing problem. 
   Max has escaped from the hospital, as crazy as they come, killing a 
   nurse during his escape. Now the police are after him, too, using 
   dogs to sniff out his scent (This part of the film mimics <B><A HREF="quatermass_xperiment_1955.htm">THE
    QUARTERMASS XPERIMENT</A></B> [a.k.a. <B><A HREF="creeping_unknown_1955.htm">THE
    CREEPING UNKNOWN</A></B> - 1955] to some extant). I'll give you one 
   guess where Max is heading. That's right, he is heading towards Ellen 
   who, in his twisted, diseased mind, is the only woman he ever loved.<A HREF="caltiki_the_immortal_monster_1959.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/caltiki the immortal monster poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="195" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   John is forced to leave Ellen and his daughter alone when Professor 
   Rodriquez's assistant calls and tells him the blob is alive and 
   growing rapidly. John tells him that he will be right over, but he 
   should set fire to the laboratory and kill the blob. Once John gets 
   to the lab, he finds it completely destroyed by fire and the blob 
   dead. We then discover that an approaching comet in the sky is 
   somehow affecting the blob, as the piece of the blob that John has in 
   his home laboratory is growing rapidly. Somehow, the comet causes 
   Professor Rodriguez to lose control of his car, as he drives off a 
   cliff and it explodes, killing him. Just when Max arrives at John's 
   house, the blob grows to enormous proportions. Max kills Linda (Who 
   loved him!) and takes Ellen prisoner, but before he can rape her, the 
   blob bursts through a wall and engulfs Max, turning him into a 
   skeleton. The blob chases Ellen and her daughter upstairs and starts 
   to slowly destroy the house (The sight of the blob oozing upstairs 
   trying to devour Ellen is very well done). John, who is being held in 
   a room in a Mexico City police station, under arrest for assisting 
   Max's escape (!), escapes and races home, as the police follow him. 
   They will soon forget about John and have to deal with the giant blob 
   that destroys everything in its path. Can John save his wife and 
   daughter and kill the blob? Maybe flamethrowers will work.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   but, due to contractual obligations, could not be credited as a 
   director (Freda would later claim that he abandoned this film so Bava 
   could show everyone what a good director he was. That is simply 
   untrue, because it doesn't explain how Bava directed parts of Freda's <B><A HREF="#DevilsCommandment57">THE
    DEVIL'S COMMANDMENT</A></B> - 1957 and still didn't get directorial

    it is wonderfully photographed, full of Bava's patented lush and 
   atmospheric cinematography, especially the cave sequences. Even the 
   way the blob is shot (My friend from across the pond told me that the 
   blob was actually made of tripe, the stomach lining of a cow, which 
   Italians eat for dinner!), using miniature sets and forced 
   perspective, are very well handled (much better than the Steve

   Especially outstanding are the deaths, which are quite graphic for a 
   late-'50s production, especially Bob's skull-headed body still 
   breathing and Max's death, which are shocking and unforgettable. I 
   still remember those deaths after 50-odd years, when I first saw them 
   on TV. Seeing it now is no different. They are still as disturbing as 
   when I was a child, one of the few films to stand up to my childhood 
   memories of it. So, if you want to see a film that out-blobs <B>THE BLOB</B>,

    Five years later, David and Alice are living in that house with 
   their young son Billy (Calum Heath), but David thinks his wife is 
   having an affair, since she gets texts on her cell phone in the 
   middle of the night. Alice tells him the texts are from her boss 
   Steven (Conor Horgan), saying because Steven has no life he thinks 
   his employees are at his beck and call twenty-four/seven. While David 
   is watching a recently discovered short film from 1902, which is 
   showing an apparent real-life murder, David suddenly realizes that it 
   was filmed on the road he now lives on. He then realizes that the 
   murder took place in the house he now lives in, watching the police 
   taking away murderer William Jackson (Padraig Curran) in handcuffs 
   out of the front door of his house. That night, David tells Alice 
   that he had a really strange day today, saying that he watched a&nbsp;
    1902 film that their house was in. He says there was a murder in 
   their house; a man named William Jackson murdered his wife Margaret 
   (Alicja Ayres) in the very same bedroom they are in now. Alice tells 
   David not to worry about it; horrible things happen in every old 
   house. David doesn't know it (?), but more than one horrible thing

    David and Alice go to a fancy party thrown by her boss Steven and 
   his firm. They leave Billy in the capable hands of new babysitter 
   Sophie (Kelly Byrne). At the party, David becomes suspicious of his 
   wife, as men he has never met take special interest in Alice. She 
   tells David that they are new clients who wanted to talk business, 
   but she refused, saying this was neither the place or the time, 
   finishing by telling David, &quot;I love you.&quot; I don't know 
   about you, but as a divorced man, this sets off red flags to me! At 
   his work, Claire tells David that he looks terrible, but it is quite 
   obvious by her actions that she has a romantic interest in David. 
   David starts having nightmares about the 1902 murder, only he is the 
   one killing William Jackson's wife; the creepy William suddenly 
   appearing when a bedroom wall splits in half, revealing William 
   smiling approvingly at David. David is also haunted by visions of 
   Alice having sex with a faceless man in their bed, so he picks up a 
   claw hammer and walks slowly towards them, waking up before he kills 
   them. When Alice leaves for work late at night and doesn't come home, 
   he goes to the police to report her missing. This results in a large 
   search for Alice, police and volunteers combing the woods and 
   long-abandoned buildings near their home, but they come up empty. 
   Police Detective McNamara (Steve Oram; <B><A HREF="altar_2014.htm">ALTAR</A></B> 
   - 2014) begins to think David is involved in Alice's disappearance, 
   telling him that Alice's lover came to the station to say he was with 
   Alice the night she disappeared and he also said that Alice was going 
   to divorce him. David denies it, telling the Detective that his wife 
   loved him and asking if he questioned Alice's lover. The Detective 
   says that her lover has an ironclad alibi that can be backed-up by

   something he wasn't expecting. It turns out that Alice was pregnant. 
   As David leaves the morgue, he sees a man sitting nearby, and after

    Alice's mother Marie (Anneke Blok) believes David killed her 
   daughter and wants Billy to live with her, but David flatly refuses, 
   so she hurtfully tells David that Alice's lover, Alex (Carl Shaaban), 
   was so traumatized by her death that he had to be hospitalized. David 
   says he couldn't give a fuck and demands she leave his house 
   immediately. David then confesses to Claire that he followed his wife 
   the night she disappeared and he watched her having sex with Alex, 
   but he had nothing to do with her death, saying to Claire that all he 
   did was puke his guts out in one of the abandoned buildings near his 
   house (which was actually a public bathroom before it was abandoned). 
   David then begins to believe that ghosts are haunting his house and, 
   somehow, the 1902 short film holds the clues to Alice's death. Is 
   David going mad are is there truth to his beliefs? I'm afraid you are 
   going to have to watch the film to get any more answers, but this 
   film is so well made and scary, you'll thank me for not divulging more.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    It's hard to believe that this film flew under the radar when

   enjoying it now. Director/screenwriter Ivan Kavanagh (<B><A HREF="tin_can_man_2007.htm">TIN
    CAN MAN</A></B> - 2007; <B><A HREF="never_grow_old_2019.htm">NEVER

   fuel, as there are many scenes here that will chill you to your core, 
   especially the sequence where David is talking to Billy via Skype on 
   his laptop and something happens that I guarantee will give you 
   goosebumps the size of grapes. It also has one of the most

   time. Effectively acted by everyone involved (especially Rupert 
   Evans) and beautifully written by Kavanagh, this is one superb, 
   thoroughly frightening film you will never forget once you watch it. 
   Be prepared for several excellent jump scares (which I really hate, 
   but they are done well here), one of them so horrific (you'll know it

   by Margheriti, but unlike <B><A HREF="web_of_the_spider_1971.htm">SPIDER</A></B>,
    this film is in glorious black &amp; white, the perfect format for 
   an Italian Gothic horror film. Margheriti was an old hand at Gothic 
   horror, previously giving us <B><A HREF="horror_castle_1963.htm">HORROR

   a horror genre director, making films in many different genres (see

    Reporter Alan Foster (Georges Rivi&egrave;re; <B><A HREF="journey_beneath_the_desert_1961.htm">JOURNEY
    BENEATH THE DESERT</A></B> - 1961) enters the Four Devils Pub and 
   listens to Edgar Allan Poe (Silvano Tranquilli, as &quot;Montgomery 
   Gleen&quot;; <B><A HREF="#HorribleDrHitch1962">THE HORRIBLE DR. HICHCOCK</A></B> 
   - 1962) telling one of his short stories about life after death to a 
   rapt audience of imbibers. Alan wants to interview Poe (he has been 
   refusing Alan's requests for quite some time) and after hearing Poe's 
   story in the pub, he tells Poe he couldn't possibly believe in the 
   afterlife, because it is nothing but a fallacy (&quot;My fear is the 
   living&quot;, says Alan). Lord Thomas Blackwood (Umberto Raho, as 
   &quot;Raul H. Newman&quot;; <B><A HREF="#TropicOfCancer1972">TROPIC 
   OF CANCER</A></B> - 1972), Poe's friend, bets Alan that he can't 
   spend one night in his castle, which is said to be haunted by the 
   dead. Since Alan doesn't believe in life after death, Alan takes Lord 
   Blackwood up on his bet for ten pounds, but only if he can interview 
   Poe. Poe says he would be glad to give Alan an interview, but only 
   after he spends the night in the castle. Alan agrees, so Poe 
   accompanies Lord Blackwood and Alan on the two hour carriage ride to 
   the castle, Poe telling Alan he will be waiting for him at the front 
   gate of the castle at dawn, that is, if he lives through the night.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Once in the castle, Alan does some exploring, finding a thick layer 
   of dust covering everything, as if no one has been inside for years, 
   but the grandfather clock in the room starts chiming, even though its 
   pendulum is not swinging back and forth. Alan begins talking to 
   himself and taking notes, when he hears music and sees people dancing 
   in the next room. The door then slams shut and when Alan opens it, 
   there's no one there. He starts playing the harpsicord, when a woman 
   touches him on the shoulder, scaring the life out of him (so to 
   speak). She introduces herself as Elisabeth (Gothic horror queen 
   Barbara Steele; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightmareCastle1965">NIGHTMARE
    CASTLE</A></B> - 1965), the sister of Lord Thomas Blackwood. Alan 
   says Thomas told him the castle would be empty and Elisabeth says her 
   brother tells everyone that, because, &quot;To Thomas, I am 
   dead.&quot; Alan finds Elisabeth very beautiful and tells her so and 
   Elisabeth tells Alan he won't be lonely tonight. Another pretty 
   woman, Julia Alert (Margrete Robsahm), enters the room and Elisabeth 
   becomes angry and jealous, because Alan says she is beautiful, too, 
   and begins paying attention to her. Julia tells Alan she will not see 
   him in the morning and he asks if she is leaving the castle. &quot;I 
   did not say that&quot;, replies Julia mysteriously. When Alan excuses 
   himself to retire for the night and leaves the room, the two women 
   get into an arguement, Elisabeth telling Julia that Alan is hers and 
   she better keep her hands off him. Julia reminds Elisabeth that the 
   castle &quot;owns&quot; her and she can never leave it, but Elisabeth 
   says it doesn't matter, because she has an eternity to spend with 
   Alan. Elisabeth then sneaks into Alan's bedroom and they make love, 
   but Alan can't hear Elisabeth's heart beating, thinking she is dead, 
   yet she is alive. Suddenly, a bare-chested, muscular man named 
   Herbert (Giovanni Cianfriglia, as &quot;Phil Karson&quot;; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#GunanKing1982">GUNAN,
    KING OF THE BARBARIANS</A></B> - 1982) bursts through the bedroom 
   door and stabs Elisabeth in the heart with a dagger. Alan grabs his 
   pistol and chases Herbert, shooting him in the back, as he falls down 
   dead. Alan goes back to his bedroom, but Elisabeth's body is gone. 
   When he exits his bedroom, Herbert's body is no longer on the floor. 
   Alan can't understand what is going on, but if he believed in the 
   afterlife, he wouldn't be so confused.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Alan then meets Dr. Carmus (Arturo Dominici, as &quot;Henry 
   Kruger&quot;; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackSunday1960">BLACK SUNDAY</A></B> 
   - 1960; also starring Steele), a famous scientist and expert on 
   &quot;metaphysical science&quot;, who disappeared years ago and was 
   never found. He tells Alan that Thomas let him live in the castle to 
   perform his experiments away from prying public eyes (Dr. Carmus 
   believes the body lives long after death and shows a disbelieving 
   Alan it is true by cutting the head off a live snake, as Alan watches 
   the snake's head and body moving independently of each other). He 
   also tells Alan that today is All Hallow's Eve, the night when all 
   the dead in the castle must relive their crimes and deaths over and 
   over, including Elisabeth's death at the hands of Herbert. Alan 
   doesn't believe a word of what Dr. Carmus says, that is until Dr. 
   Carmus takes him on a tour of the castle, where &quot;The dead are 
   living tonight&quot;, as Alan watches a series of murders and deaths 
   involving Elisabeth, Julia and Herbert. Alan can't believe his eyes 
   and tells Dr. Carmus that all this is nothing but a perverse stage 
   play with actors. Dr. Carmus then disappears and Alan begins to 
   slowly go mad, as he watches people he has never seen before, who 
   were past castle visitors, get murdered in the castle. He then 
   watches Dr. Carmus opening Elisabeth's tomb, where her decaying 
   corpse is still breathing. Dr. Carmus then runs upstairs to his 
   office, where he is killed by Herbert. Dr. Carmus then appears behind 
   Alan, saying now Alan knows how he died, so it's too late for him to 
   leave the castle...alive. Alan tries to leave the castle, but all the 
   doors and windows won't open. All the dead people in the castle 
   approach Alan, telling him it's his turn to die (&quot;Your blood 
   will be our life!&quot;), but Elisabeth offers him a way to escape. 
   As dawn rapidly approaches, Alan find's himself in the castle's 
   crypt, all the dead people coming at him from all sides. Elisabeth 
   once again appears, and shows him a way out of the castle. Alan drags 
   Elisabeth with him, but she begs him to let her go, because she can't 
   leave the castle. Alan drags her outside, where Elisabeth turns into 
   a skeleton. Alan opens the front gate just as dawn arrives, thinking 
   he has won the bet, but the gate closes on its own, one of the gate's 
   iron spike impaling Alan in the neck, killing him. When Thomas and 
   Poe arrive at the castle and see that Alan is dead, Thomas pulls the 
   wallet out of Alan's coat, takes ten pounds from it, telling Poe a 
   bet's a bet, but he will make sure Alan's body is put in the castle's 
   crypt. Next All Hallow's Eve, the castle will have a new body to 
   haunt the next person to take Lord Thomas Blackwood up on his bet.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This is one of the last Italian Gothic Horror films I have yet to 
   review (there are some lesser-known ones that I will get 
   to...eventually) and now that I have, it has made me feel really sad, 
   because Gothic horror has become a lost art form on film and no one 
   did them better than Italy did. It also helped that Italy had (and 
   still has) many ancient castles to film in, so there was no need to 
   build sets, giving their films an extra layer of realism, missing 
   from Gothic horror films from other countries. And no one was better 
   at using castles to their full effect than Antonio Margheriti, who 
   knew exactly where to place cameras to make viewers feel there was 
   danger around every corner or in every shadow. This film displays 
   that talent expertly, as you never know what or who Alan will 
   discover as he walks through the castle, making us jump as he turns 
   every corner. You know a film is timeless when it affects me today 
   the same way when I first saw it in a theater over fifty years ago. 
   The screenplay, by Giovanni Grimaldi (as &quot;Jean Grimaud&quot;; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#BlanchevilleMon1963">THE
    BLANCHEVILLE MONSTER</A></B> - 1963) and Sergio Corbucci (as 
   &quot;Gordon Wilson Jr.&quot;; the director/writer of the superior 
   Spaghetti Western <B><A HREF="great_silence_1968.htm">THE GREAT SILENCE</A></B> 
   - 1968), is full of many surprising, unexpected plot reveals, making 
   it one of the best Italian Gothic horror films I have seen, but if I 
   am being truthful, I have to say that there are precious few films in 
   this genre that I genuinely dislike. Sergio Corbucci was this film's 
   original director, but left after one week of filming and was 
   replaced by Margheriti. I believe the Gothic horror film genre is 
   dead today due that it's more effective in black &amp; white and 
   shooting in that format is becoming a lost art form, as 
   &quot;modern&quot; audiences (i.e. Teens that have their cell phones 
   glued to their eyeballs) don't want to sit in a theater, or in front 
   of a TV, watching a black &amp; white film (I actually had a friend 
   say, &quot;Life is in color, so why should I watch a film that 
   isn't?&quot; I wanted to punch him squarely in the face!). That's too 
   bad, for if a black &amp; white film is done right, it can transport 
   you to a time and place where you don't realize, or care, you are not 
   watching a color film. I should also mention that people watching the 
   U.S. edit of this film are missing out on a scene containing 
   something very rare for a film of this vintage, namely a topless 
   scene by actress Sylvia Sorrente, who portrays Elsi Perkins, a 
   newlywed who comes to the<A HREF="castle_of_blood_1964.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/castle of blood italy poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   castle with new hudband William (Benito Stefanelli, as &quot;Ben 
   Steffen&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Slasher1972">THE SLASHER...IS 
   THE SEX MANIAC!</A></B> - 1972), only for the both of them to be 
   murdered by Herbert. Still, the U.S. print offers us plenty of 
   scares, but it would have been nice if the topless scene was 
   included, but audiences in the '60s weren't considered 
   &quot;adult&quot; enough to see naked tits on the screen, especially 
   in a horror film (sexploitation films were in their infancy at the 
   time). Also strange is that neither Barbara Steele or Georges 
   Rivi&egrave;re names appear in the opening credits of the film, which 
   is weird, because they both play major roles in the film (and Barbara 
   Steele was well-known by American audiences at the time). The music 
   soundtrack, by Riz Ortolani (billed as &quot;Ritz Ortolani&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SevenBloodOrchids72">SEVEN
    BLOOD-STAINED ORCHIDS</A></B> - 1972), is also very memorable, 
   increasing the scare factor in the castle by use of a theremin and 
   orchestral passages. Ruggero Deodato (billed here as &quot;Roger 
   Drake&quot;), the director of such films as <B><A HREF="jungle_holocaust_1976.htm">JUNGLE
    HOLOCAUST</A></B> (1977) and <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#HouseEdgePark1979">THE
    HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK</A></B> (1979), was the Assistant 
   Director here and has frequently said that working with Sergio 
   Corbucci and Antonio Margheriti on this film made him want to become 
   a director. The rest is history. This is not just a great horror film 
   it also has a history that was influential in many ways. If you 
   haven't seen this film, or even if you have in the past, jump on it 
   immediately! Gothic horror doesn't get much better than this.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    CHILDREN</A><A NAME="Children1980"></A> (1980) -</B> It's hard to 
   make a list of the best low-budget horror film of the early 80's and 
   not have this film appear in the top twenty. It's moody, scary and, 
   above all, shocking in the way it deals with children killing adults 
   and adults killing children. A toxic leak at the Yankee Power 
   Company's nuclear power plant causes a radioactive fog in which a 
   school bus full of children from the town of Ravensback passes 
   through (this film is a.k.a. <B><A HREF="children_of_ravensback_1980.htm">THE
    CHILDREN OF RAVENSBACK</A></B>). Sheriff Billy Hart (Gil Rogers) 
   finds the bus abandoned on the side of a road opposite a graveyard 
   (the motor is still running and all the children's belongings are 
   still on it), with the children and bus driver nowhere to be found. 
   The sheriff stops at the first house on the bus's route to see if 
   student Tommy Button (Nathaniel Albright) has made it home, but 
   Tommy's mother is too zonked out on codeine to notice, so her 
   personal physician (and probable lesbian lover), Dr. Joyce Gould 
   (Michelle LaMothe), helps the sheriff search for Tommy and the other 
   children. Billy has his deputy, Harry Timmons (Tracy Griswold), set 
   up a roadblock to the only entrance in town to stop anyone from 
   leaving and to only let residents enter, since he begins to think 
   this is <A HREF="children_1980.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/children poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="201" HEIGHT="318" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>looking
    like a mass kidnapping. We know this is not the case when the 
   acerbic Joyce declines a ride of from Billy (her distaste for men is 
   quite evident), discovers the bus driver's dead body in the graveyard 
   (his entire body looks burned to a crisp) and she is hugged by an 
   infected Tommy (you can tell the infected by their black 
   fingernails). Joyce suffers the same fate as the bus driver, as 
   Tommy's radioactive fingers burrow into Joyce's back and she 
   instantly becomes an overcooked steak. Katie, bar the door, because 
   some killer children are about to terrorize Ravensback! The children 
   instinctively head to their homes, but Billy seems to always be one 
   step behind. The only house he comes to before the children attack is 
   the one belonging to the loopy Dee Dee Shore (Rita Montone), who is 
   sunbathing topless by her pool while her muscle-headed boyfriend is 
   pumping iron. Dee Dee seems more excited about the prospect of her 
   daughter being kidnapped than her welfare (Most of the parents 
   depicted here are less than complimentary). Billy picks up John 
   Freemont (Martin Shakar), a parent of one of the missing children, 
   whose car has stalled on the side of the road and agrees to drive him 
   home after thay stop at the Chandler residence, but little Ellen 
   Chandler (Sarah Albright) has already given her mother and father the 
   hug of death. When Billy and John find Dee Dee's daughter, Janet 
   (Julie Carrier), walking down a dark road and discover her killing 
   power (she grabs Billy's hand and gives him a nasty burn), they race 
   to John's house, where his pregnant wife and young son (who was home 
   sick from school) are about to be attacked by their infected 
   daughter, Clara (Jenny Freemont). John and Billy have to make the 
   difficult decision to kill the children by the only means effective: 
   by chopping off their hands! The final coda should not come as a 
   surprise to eagle-eyed viewers who paid close attention when the 
   school bus passed through the radioactive cloud.&nbsp; What can I 
   say? This is one of those horror film that I can watch over and over 
   and never grow tired of. Director/co-producer Max Kalmanowicz (<B><A HREF="dreams_come_true_1984.htm">DREAMS
    COME TRUE</A></B> - 1984) and screenwriters Carlton J. Albright (a 
   co-producer here and also the director of the underrated <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Luther Geek">LUTHER
    THE GEEK</A></B> - 1990) &amp; Edward Terry (the star of <B>LUTHER</B>,
    who also has a role here as a deputized hick) have fashioned a 
   creepy, atmospheric and scary horror film about what happens when 
   children become killers and how responsible adults (although there 
   are too few in this film, which I believe was intentional) must deal 
   with the situation. The screenplay handles the situation in a frank, 
   straightforward fashion (but not without some intentional humor) as 
   parents are confronted with a truly unique situation. Most of them 
   naturally go for the hug (Who wouldn't when they stick their arms out 
   and say &quot;Mommy!&quot;?), but Billy, John and John's wife, Cathy 
   (Gale Garnett), must make the heartbreaking decision that all the 
   infected children (who have gathered outside of John's house in a sly 
   tribute to <B><A HREF="night_of_the_living_dead_1968.htm">NIGHT OF 
   THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> - 1968) must die and the only way to kill 
   them is to cut off their hands. There is very little here left to the 
   imagination, as the children are shot (but they get right up) and 
   chopped into pieces (where they let out a god-awful growling sound), 
   but that's what makes this film work so well (the special effects are 
   surprisingly well done, especially the radiation burnings). This is a 
   parent's worst nightmare and <B><A HREF="children_1980b.htm">THE CHILDREN</A></B> 
   illustrates that nightmare in a way very few horror films can. Harry

   with Dr. Sam Simon (Paul Coufos; <B><A HREF="food_of_the_gods_part_2_1989.htm">FOOD

   Woronov (who return as their characters Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bland from <B><A HREF="eating_raoul_1982.htm">EATING
    RAOUL</A></B> - 1982), so safe, in fact, that he plans on using 
   three of the robots to patrol the mall they are in for the next few 
   nights (too bad none of the many stores' employees are ever told 
   about it). This just happens when a bunch of teenage employees, from 
   various stores and restaurants, plan to spend the night at the mall 
   after the stores close and party (Drink and have sex, that is). A 
   freak electrical storm hits the mall and does something bad to the 
   robots. It's like they have become self-aware and don't care too much 
   for humans (The original and more fitting title for this film is <B><A HREF="killbots_1986.htm">KILLBOTS</A></B>,
    which it was first released theatrically as, but it did bad business 
   because people were expecting some type of robot-like kiddie film 
   that was popular at the time and not a gore film, so uncredited 
   Executive Producer Roger Corman cut over 15 minutes out of the film 
   [it originally ran 95 minites and now runs 77 minutes] and renamed 
   it, where it did much better business. The TV version adds several 
   minutes of outtakes, because the cut footage was gone and could not 
   be found, probably for good [another Corman trait], so the film could 
   fit in a 2 hour timeslot.). After the comical opening credits (Look 
   for Toni Naples [Wynorski's <B><A HREF="transylvania_twist_1989.htm">TRANSYLVANIA
    TWIST</A></B> - 1989] in a bikini and Rodney Eastman [<B><A HREF="i_spit_on_your_grave_2010.htm">I

   joint worker Alison Parks (Kelli Maroney; <B><A HREF="night_of_the_comet_1984.htm">NIGHT
    OF THE COMET</A></B> - 1984) being clumsy and dropping dishes, 
   annoying the cook and owner (Mel Welles; the director of <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LadyFrankenstein">LADY
    FRANKENSTEIN</A></B> - 1971), who says, &quot;Oh, you a-breaking my

   - 1985) sets up Allison on a blind date for the party tonight, which 
   happens to be nerd Ferdy Meisel (Tony O'Dell; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Evils of the Night">EVILS
    OF THE NIGHT</A></B> - 1984) who is acting as boss for his father's 
   furniture store and keeps getting taken advantage of by co-workers 
   Mike (John Terlesky; Wynorski's <B><A HREF="deathstalker_2_1987.htm">DEATHSTALKER
    II</A></B> - 1987, who went on to be a successful TV series 
   director), Suzi's boyfriend, and Greg (Nick Segal; <B><A HREF="school_spirit_1985.htm">SCHOOL
    SPIRIT</A></B> - 1985), who will also be at the party. Also at the 
   party will be husband &amp; wife Rick &amp; Linda (Russell Todd &amp; 
   Karrie Emerson) and Leslie (Suzee Slater; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Cartel">CARTEL</A></B> 
   - 1990), Mike's girlfriend. Mr. Todd (Arthur Roberts; Wynorski's <B><A HREF="big_bad_mama_2_1987.htm">BIG
    BAD MAMA II</A></B> - 1987) catches daughter Leslie and Mike kissing 
   and Leslie tells her father she and Mike are excited to be going over 
   to Suzi's house for her birthday tonight (a total lie). The first 
   casualty of the robots is Technician Marty (Morgan Douglas), who is 
   looking at the centerfold in an issue of Playboy, when a robotic arm 
   comes tearing through the centerfold and crushes his neck. Technician 
   Nessler (Gerrit Graham; <B><A HREF="#TerrorVision1986">TERRORVISION</A></B> 
   - 1986) is the next victim, as one of the robots shoots and kills him 
   with a miniature grappling hook to the back of his neck in the 
   Control Room. Without any technicians, the robots are able to do as 
   they please throughout the mall. After the mall closes, the party 
   begins and Ferdy is about to meet Alison for the very first time (We 
   can spot a poster for Jack Hill's <B><A HREF="sorceress_1982.htm">SORCERESS</A></B> 
   [1982] in the mirror and if you look hard enough, you can see a 
   poster of Wynorski's first film during the pizza joint shots.). It's 
   love at first sight for Ferdy, but since he's a nerd, he takes things 
   very slow, unlike the rest of the revelers. Everyone but Ferdy and 
   Alison are making out (of course, it's Barbara Crampton to first show 
   us her tits), while our blind dates are watching <B><A HREF="attack_of_the_crab_monsters_1957.htm">ATTACK
    OF THE CRAB MONSTERS</A></B> (1957) on TV (The film was directed by 
   Roger Corman, as a little in-joke since his name is nowhere to be 
   found on Wynorski's film. This film was produced by Roger's wife, 
   Julie Corman.). Ferdy and Alison hit it off and start kissing on a 
   couch in his father's furniture store. Meanwhile, the robots are 
   roaming the hallways of the mall, each one taking a separate floor. 
   The next person to die is janitor Walter Paisley (Character actor 
   supreme Dick Miller, who first used this name in <B><A HREF="bucket_of_blood_1959.htm">A
    BUCKET OF BLOOD</A></B> [1959] and has used it in several films as a 
   joke when he has small roles), as a robot rolls up behind him, tips 
   over Walter's water bucket and electrocutes him with a 50,000 volt 
   taser. The robot says, &quot;Thank you. Have a nice day.&quot; and 
   leaves, as Walter's body is burned beyond recognition. Leslie talks 
   Mike into going outside the furniture store to buy her a pack of 
   cigarettes from a machine (She shows him her lovely breasts an an 
   incentive). As he is about to buy the smokes, one of the robots 
   shoots a tranquilizer dart into him before snapping his neck. (When 
   Mike first sees the robot, he says &quot;klaatu barada nikto&quot; 
   from <B><A HREF="day_the_earth_stood_still_1951.htm">THE DAY THE 
   EARTH STOOD STILL</A></B> [1952] before being murdered.). Leslie, 
   dressed in a blouse and panties, goes looking for Mike and finds him 
   with his throat slit wide open. She runs from the robot (who is 
   hiding in the shadows in an emergency exit cubby hole), while it 
   fires pink laser pulses at her, hitting her once in the shoulder. As 
   everyone watches in the front of the furniture store, the robot blows 
   Leslie's head off in one of the best head explosions ever committed 
   to film (I remember when I had this film on VHS, moving the tape 
   frame-by-frame and still couldn't spot the change from live to dummy 
   head, unlike the easy to spot switch in the head explosion in <B><A HREF="scanners_1981.htm">SCANNERS</A></B> 
   [1981]. I still consider it one of the best head explosions in a 
   film.). When they realize that there are a lot more victims to be had 
   in the furniture store, two robots break through the glass and go 
   after them. The robots destroy the furniture store while firing at 
   the partiers, until the humans find shelter in a metal storage 
   closet. They have no way out until 6:00am, but the girls make it into 
   the air conditioning shafts to try and find a way outside. The robots 
   are smart enough to know what they are trying to do, so they shoot 
   very hot air through the ducts. The guys make it to a sporting goods 
   store, where they pick up shotguns and other supplies to try and 
   defeat the robots. They manage to destroy one robot with a 
   well-placed propane tank and some gunfire. It becomes too hot in the 
   ducts to make it down to the underground parking area, so they go 
   back to help their boyfriends. They grab some gasoline from some gas 
   cans in a store (which you would never find in any store in real life 
   because it is against the law), make some molitov cocktails and go 
   looking for their boyfriends. Seems like the robot that the guys 
   thought they killed isn't so dead. The molitov cocktails have no 
   effect on the robots and one robot burns Suzi to death with her own 
   gasoline. The cast retaliates by dropping one robot several stories 
   from an elevator. The remaining humans decide to go to the third 
   floor to go to the Control Room and shut down the robots, but Greg is 
   thrown down several levels of the mall by a robot and dies. The rest 
   run away from the other two robots and hide behind a metal grate. As 
   one of the <A HREF="killbots_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/killbots poster9 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="193" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>robots
    is using a laser to cut a hole through the metal grate, the 
   remaining four humans must try to find a way to the Control Room, but 
   they need to rest first (not the best time for that). With the hole 
   in the metal grate complete, for some reason, one of the robots goes 
   out of control and kills Rick and Linda before blowing up. Ferdy and 
   Alison decide to split up to look for the Control Room (never a good 
   thing) and Alison blows up the final robot to pieces in a paint store 
   with a flare. Ferdy and Alison live happily ever after. And remember: 
   &quot;Thank you. Have a nice day.&quot;&nbsp; I consider this to be 
   one of Jim Wynorski's best films not just because of the many cameos 
   (I'll let you discover some of them yourself, although there is a 
   quick appearance by Angus Scrimm [<B><A HREF="phantasm_1979.htm">PHANTASM</A></B> 
   - 1979; using the name &quot;Lawrence Guy&quot; here]), but because 
   the film doesn't let up from the get-go and the Killbots look really 
   good and functional (they could probably be used on malls today and 
   shoppers wouldn't give them a second look) and gives the film a sense 
   of realism, something, say, <B><A HREF="terminator_1984.htm">THE TERMINATOR</A></B> 
   (1984), still can't pull off. It's not that I don't love James 
   Cameron's film (actually, I love it), it's just there are robots and 
   then there are ROBOTS. The one in all caps are the kind that we won't 
   see the light of days for years, but the lower case ones are already 
   a reality, vacuuming our floors and keeping an eye on our houses 
   without being told what to do. Robots today still depend on the human 
   element, making them subsceptable to human error (Which is why there 
   is a Control Room in this film), so we still have to be wary and 
   attentive to what we think are robots (I consider computers robots, 
   too, because they are able to do things quicker, faster and do things 
   we are unable to do). Jim Wynorski, who co-wrote the screenplay with 
   Steve Mitchell (who is also Second Unit Director here and wrote the 
   screenplay to Wynorski's <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Against The law">AGAINST
    THE LAW</A></B> [1997]), throws in a lot of references to other 
   films and it's apparent that this film (also known under the 
   head-scratching title <B><A HREF="shopping_1986.htm">SHOPPING</A></B>)
    is a labor of love for him. Filmed for $800,000 at the Beverly 
   Centre Mall in Los Angeles, California at night under stipulation 
   that there would be no film equipment or messes around the mall when 
   it opened at 9:00am. Originally available on VHS from <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Lightning Video">Lightning
    Video</A>, but since the negative for the film is in legal limbo, 
   Lionsgate Entertainment used the same fullscreen video master as the 
   Lightning tape (even using the Lightning Video logo!) and squeezed it 
   onto one single-sided DVD with three other horror films on the 2-disc <B><A HREF="horror_collection_8_movie_pack_dvd_compilation.htm">HORROR
    COLLECTION 8 MOVIE PACK</A></B> (which is a shame because there are

   and <B><A HREF="class_of_1999_1990.htm">CLASS OF 1999</A></B> (1990). 
   Although there are a few compression artifacts (especially on my 
   60&quot; plasma TV), it is watchable, but it deserves a much better 
   fate than this. Maybe one day those 15 minutes of cut footage will be 
   found and we will get to see the original <B><A HREF="killbots_1986.htm">KILLBOTS</A></B>

   with Christmas and what it represents. It's thirty three years later

   even has a job in a toy factory and has just got a promotion, even if 
   he is not happy with the quality of the toys they manufacture or care 
   for the attitude of his greedy boss Frank (Joe Jamrog). When Harry 
   becomes stressed, he hums Christmas carols to himself and spies on 
   his brother Phil (Jeffrey DeMunn of <B><A HREF="haunted_1991.htm">THE HAUNTED</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"> </FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">-
    1991). Harry pines for the life of his brother, who has a beautiful 
   wife (Dianne Hull of <B><A HREF="fifth_floor_1978.htm">THE FIFTH FLOOR</A></B> 
   - 1978) and two kids. Harry knows that he will never have that kind 
   of life because he will be unable to find anyone who will understand 
   his obsession. As Christmastime rapidly approaches, Harry becomes 
   more and more disillusioned with the way people take Christmas for 
   granted. After trying to teach people the true meaning of Christmas 
   and failing miserably, he finally snaps and adds murder to his 
   ever-growing list. The Santa you see standing next to you may not be 
   of sound mind. Also known as <B><A HREF="terror_in_toyland_1980.htm">TERROR
    IN TOYLAND</A> </B>and <B>YOU BETTER WATCH OUT</B>, director Lewis 
   Jackson (his only effort) films this more as a psychological tale of 
   a man's descent into madness rather than the horror film the ads make 
   it out to be. Brandon Maggart (who got his start on <B><A HREF="sesame_street_tv_series_1969_present.htm">SESAME
    STREET</A></B>, believe it or not!) is wonderful as Harry, as he 
   makes his character sympathetic, even when he is doing creepy things 
   such as superglueing a fake white beard on his face so no one can 
   pull it off (thereby making him the real &quot;Santa Claus&quot;) or 
   replacing presents under Christmas trees that he thinks are more 
   appropriate for the bad boys and girls. While we may think that 
   Christmas has become too &quot;commercial&quot;, Harry has the balls 
   to do something about it (even if he does get carried away). He has 
   his faults, but his heart is in the right place, as the scene where 
   he delivers a vanload of stolen toys to a children's hospital shows 
   us. When he finally goes on his killing spree, all the right people 
   get what they deserve. He first kills three arrogant men who ridicule 
   him after they come out of church. He stabs one in the eye with a toy 
   soldier and kills the other two with axe-blows to their heads. As 
   with all vigilantes, he goes too far and is chased by an angry mob of 
   parents carrying torches (!) and ends in what has to be one of the 
   most whacked-out finales that you will ever see. But does it really 
   end the way it seems? You will have to use your ears here to really 
   know how it ends. It is memorable. The film also has some humorous 
   moments, such as the <A HREF="christmas_evil_1980_santa_claus_lineup.htm">police
    line-up of Santas</A> who are forced to say &quot;Merry 
   Christmas!&quot; in their best jolly voice or the kid who says he 
   wants a lifetime subscription to Penthouse for Christmas. There's 
   precious little violence here, besides what I have already mentioned 
   and the death of Harry's boss by throat-slashing. This film is not 
   about the violence and rightly so. Most reference books rate this 
   film as a bomb which makes me wonder if they have watched this film 
   at all. This is an excellent film that chronicles one man's foray 
   into madness in a world that doesn't deserve a man like him. Then 
   again, maybe I'm just reading too much into it. Either way, I enjoyed 
   it immensely. This film is available in many forms. The one I viewed 
   was on the 10 film DVD compilation titled <B><A HREF="tales_of_terror.htm">TALES

   Director Ted V. Mikels is an acquired taste. Some people love his 
   films to death, while others think he's nothing but a talentless 
   hack. I fall somewhere in the middle, but I must confess that I find 
   this film to be one of my guilty pleasures. The story here is rather 
   straightforward and simple: The owners of Lotus Cat Food Company, Mr. 
   Landau (Sanford Mitchell) and Mr. Malt<A HREF="corpse_grinders_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/corpse grinders dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>by
    (J. Byron Foster), manage to stay in business competing with the 
   larger pet food companies by keeping their overhead low. Very low. 
   They do this by substituting their meat by-products ingredients with 
   the flesh of human corpses, which they obtain from grave robber Caleb 
   (Warren Ball) and a couple of workers at a mortuary, who supply them 
   with fresh bodies of the recently interred or bums whose bodies will 
   not be missed. As the demand rises for for their product, Landau and 
   Maltby have a hard time keeping up with the supply, so they begin to 
   rely on murder to keep them stocked with fresh meat. The only problem 
   is, domesticated cats eating Lotus Cat Food begin attacking their 
   owners and some of those owners end up dead, which attracts the 
   attention of Dr. Howard Glass (Sean Kenney) and his nurse/lover Angie 
   Robinson (Monika Kelly), who are performing the autopsies. They begin 
   piecing the pieces of the mystery together and discover all the 
   murderous cats are being fed Lotus brand cat food. They go to the FDA 
   to have the cat food tested and discover what the mystery ingredient 
   really is but, remarkably, the FDA refuses to investigate further 
   without more proof, so Howard and Angie go undercover to get more 
   proof. They are not very good at undercover espionage (they really 
   suck at it) and Landau and Maltby, who see through their ruse 
   immediately, kidnap Angie. Howard must race to rescue Angie from the 
   jaws of the corpse-grinding machine before she is turned into the 
   ingredients for a new batch of pussy chow. Howard is given a helping 
   hand from a mysterious stranger (whom we see stalking Landau and 
   Maltby at various times throughout the film) and they save Angie in 
   the nick of time; both Landau and Maltby end up dead, one of them 
   getting chewed up by their own corpse-grinding contraption.&nbsp; As 
   undoubtedly everyone already knows, this film is mostly famous for 
   it's chintzy corpse-grinding machine, a plywood creation with 
   flashing lights and levers where bodies are fed through one end (all 
   the bodies are still in their underwear!) and come out hamburger meat 
   on the other end. To me, though, that's the least interesting aspect 
   of this film. What I find much more entertaining are the eccentric 
   and downright ugly characters on view here, including beef 
   jerky-chewing grave robber Caleb; his doll-carrying retard wife Cleo 
   (Ann Noble), who treats the doll as if it was a real baby; the mute, 
   one-legged Tessie (Drucilla Hoy), a Lotus Cat Food employee who 
   hobbles around on one crutch while delivering the mail; and Willie 
   (Charles &quot;Foxy&quot; Fox), the rubber-faced, impossibly skinny 
   Lotus janitor who becomes the first live victim of the grinding 
   machine. Director/producer/editor Ted V. Mikels (<B><A HREF="astro_zombies_1968.htm">THE

    to shots of Caleb's caged geese for no other reason than to hear 
   them squawk) and threadbare sets (the office of Lotus Cat Food is a 
   study in minimalism; just a desk, a couple of chairs and a cheap 
   hand-painted sign that reads: LOTUS CAT FOOD: &quot;For Cats Who Like 
   People&quot;!), which all together make this film seem like it was 
   made on some alternate version of Earth. Some people speak with a 
   thick Cockney accent for no reason at all and the cat attack scenes 
   are hilarious in their ineptitude (As the proud owners of two rescue 
   cats, I can assure you this is not the way cats would attack). While 
   there is no nudity in this film (the women walk or lay around in 
   their bra and panties), this impossibly cheap film does have it's 
   share of gruesome sights (including a graphic cat autopsy and a 
   basement full of body parts) and some intentionally funny scenes 
   (including Cleo feeding her doll soup at the dinner table). This film 
   is also the last credit for Arch Hall Sr. (director of the classic

   (1987) -</B> Before we get to the review, a little background about 
   the film and director/co-producer/co-writer David DeCoteau. This was 
   one of the last films to be shown as a double feature in theaters 
   (with <B><A HREF="slave_girls_from_beyond_infinity_1987.htm">SLAVE 
   GIRLS FROM BEYOND INFINITY</A></B> - 1987) and <B><A HREF="creepozoids_1987b.htm">CREEPOZOIDS</A></B> 
   was the bottom half of the double bill but, for me, the film should 
   have been at the top half because it still holds a fond place in my 
   heart for showing what one man can do with so little money. Sure, 
   there are indications of an ultra-low-budget (A lab that consists of 
   nothing but a computer and two aquariums filled with colored water; 
   filming in one location; a cast of five people, etc.), but it was 
   just such a crazy-ass film that even Fred Olen Ray directed a remake 
   of the film, called <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hybrid">HYBRID</A></B>,
    in 1996. And then there's David DeCoteau. He made no secret that he 
   was gay because he made a series of all-male porn (as well as 
   straight porn) films before he got into the genre filmmaking 
   business. He continued to make porn films while directing his first 
   few genre films (his first one was <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Dreamaniac">DREAMANIAC</A></B> 
   in 1986 and this was his <A HREF="creepozoids_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/creepozoids vhs front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>second),
    but his genre career took off like no one had ever seen before (as 
   of 2015, he has directed over 115 genre films (not counting his porn 
   films), and that's not counting the hundreds of other ones he worked 
   on in various other capacities) and during the 80's &amp; 90's, he 
   gave straight people what they wanted: naked female flesh mixed with 
   violence. But as gay rights began to gain steam in this country (and 
   it was about time), David DeCoteau formed his own production company, 
   Rapid Heart Pictures, and began to make homoerotic films of all types 
   for audiences that would appreciate them. They were (and are) never 
   hardcore, but they never shied away from the gay subtext, either. As 
   a straight man, I applaud him for that fact, but he also kept making 
   films for straight audiences, too. A lot of people consider David 
   DeCoteau a hack (don't get me wrong, he has made his share of 
   stinkers; but with that many films under his belt, how could he 
   not?), but we are talking about a man who worked since he was just a 
   young buck with such people as Roger Corman, Charles Band and Fred 
   Olen Ray and whenever I read that he is moderating or doing a running 
   commentary on a film, even if it's a film I don't like, I buy it on 
   DVD or Blu-Ray, because this is a man who knows more about filmmaking 
   than 99.9% of the people in the business and his commentaries are 
   pure gold. I have had the pleasure of communicating with David a few 
   times on Facebook (before I quit using the service; too many trolls) 
   and he has always come across as a pure gentleman and always answered 
   questions like he wasn't talking down to you. A person like that is 
   very rare commodity in the business and he should be celebrated. 
   Which brings us to the film at hand. There is only one thing that 
   really bugged me about this film: Linnea Quigley had no problems 
   doffing her clothes in this film, yet porn star Ashlyn Gere (here 
   using the name &quot;Kim McKamy&quot;) never appeared nude. I guess 
   she wanted to be taken seriously as an actress, but this was the 
   wrong vehicle for that. People come to see films like this for the 
   nudity and the violence, so I tip my hat to Linnea Quigley for 
   spending a good amount of her screen time unclothed to make up for 
   McKamy staying clothed (there was one point in the film where I 
   thought McKamy was going to get naked when she turned the shower on, 
   but it was nothing but a cheat). After watching an unnamed scientist 
   (Joi Wilson) getting killed in her bare-bones laboratory set by a 
   tall creature with giant pincers around its mouth, we are informed by 
   on-screen computer terminal-like writing that in 1998, six years 
   after the superpowers have engaged in a devastating nuclear exchange, 
   Earth is now a blackened husk of a planet. Tiny clusters of survivors 
   eke out a miserable existence in the ruins of the city, and bands of 
   military deserters roam the barren wastelands...hiding from mutant 
   nomads and seeking shelter from the deadly acid rain. We then meet 
   five deserters: Bianca (Quigley; <B><A HREF="silent_night_deadly_night_1984.htm">SILENT
    NIGHT DEADLY NIGHT</A></B> - 1984; also an associate producer); 
   Butch (Ken Abraham; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Bloody Movie">BLOODY MOVIE</A></B> 
   - 1988); Jesse (Michael Aranda; <B><A HREF="el_chupacabra_2003.htm">EL
    CHUPACABRA</A></B> - 2003), Kate (McKamy; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Evil Laugh">EVIL
    LAUGH</A></B> - 1986) and Jake (Richard Hawkins; <B><A HREF="close_encounters_of_the_third_kind_1977.htm">CLOSE
    ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND</A></B> - 1977), as they are trying to 
   find shelter from a fast approaching acid rain storm. They make it 
   just in time in the building that just happens to hold the lab where 
   we saw the lady scientist killed by the creature, so we know that 
   they are not alone. Since they are military deserters, they still 
   know how to clear a building, so they split up into two groups and 
   search the entire building (some of the rooms just don't look kosher 
   to Bianca), but all they find is a rotting head of the scientist's 
   assistant and nothing else. When Bianca finds a working shower, she 
   is ready to strip and has Butch join her. We see them both completely 
   naked, before and after the shower (something for both the guys and 
   the girls!). Jesse is using the lab's computer to try and learn what 
   they were working on there. Was this a military base or a private 
   enterprise? After trying to break into the computer's files with no 
   success (his access is always denied), he finds the scientist's 
   computer journals, where it says she was purposely cut off from 
   communicating with New L.A. (over 400 miles away) and she is worried 
   that New L.A. is in serious trouble. She mentions some new 
   experimental &quot;stuff&quot; that scares the shit out of her. If 
   this &quot;stuff&quot; is added to food, she has no idea what serious 
   repercussions that it will have to those who eat it. Jesse hears a 
   noise coming from under the desk and discovers a secret passageway, 
   which leads to a room that looks like it is full of giant cocoons. 
   While Jessie is crawling into the lair, the computer screen changes 
   and reads, &quot;Long time no see. No one suspects a thing. Covered 
   my tracks like a pro. The blood was a bitch to clean.&quot; Jesse 
   enters the room and sticks his hand in a puddle of blood, before the 
   creature attacks him and we think Jesse is dead. But, when morning 
   comes, Jesse awakens from his bed like he has no memory of what 
   happened the night before. A shirtless Butch sleeps with a topless 
   Bianca when everyone is awakened for breakfast, made by Kate. Jake 
   wants to do a more complete recon of the building to see how long 
   they can stay there (food supplies, water, etc.) when Jesse begins to 
   scream and starts to mutate in front of everyone (the fingers on his 
   hands fuse together) and he spits some black liquid out of his mouth 
   and dies face-down into his breakfast dish. Kate then says she 
   believes that this building is some kind of containment vessel. It 
   was not meant to keep people out, but to keep something in. This 
   building was meant to keep the outside world safe and she believes 
   they are all now infected with a virus where the body produces its 
   own amino acids, which means they will never have to eat food again 
   (Jesse overdosed when he ate breakfast [no one else had the chance to 
   eat yet] and it not only mutated him, it killed him). Jake and Butch 
   go to the lair, while Bianca does some investigating on her own and 
   his nearly killed by the creature. Jake is found unconscious, but 
   when he comes to, he believes the creature doesn't want to kill 
   anyone. It looks like the creature was once human and wants another 
   person to mutate like him so they can start a new intelligent species 
   on Earth. The generator goes out and Butch goes to fix it, but he is 
   attacked by a huge mother of a rat, so Jake pulls it off Butch and 
   kills it with a ray gun. The creature attacks Jake (always, and I 
   mean always, check under your desk) when he tries to send an SOS on 
   the computer. The creature, which not only has pincers on the side of 
   its mouth but extremely huge sharp teeth, attacks Butch, so now both 
   Butch and Jake are out like a light while the creature destroys the 
   computer, knocking out all communication with the outside world. The 
   creature drags Butch away, but what does he really want from them (It 
   seems Kate's reason just doesn't wash)? Another giant rat attacks 
   Bianca (even crawling up the back of her shirt, but Kate pulls it off 
   and gets bitten in the neck. Jake shows up and patches her up. The 
   creature has dragged Butch into its lair, where it sprays black 
   liquid on Butch from its mouth. He<A HREF="creepozoids_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/creepozoids dvd9 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   mutates in front of everyone's eyes when they hear him scream and 
   then he dies. The creature tries to attack Jake and Bianca, but they 
   get away. Bianca has discovered Kate has transformed into a mutant 
   and she tries to kill Bianca. You don't mess with Bianca unless you 
   want to get the horns and she kills the mutated Kate by dropping a 
   metal shelf on her and stepping on it hard until Kate stops 
   breathing. The creature brings Jake down to its lair and then kills 
   Bianca. Jake runs away and finds a medical kit on a shelf and puts 
   something into a huge hypodermic needle. After the creature nearly 
   kills Jake several times, Jake finally injects it with the hypodermic 
   needle and the creature dies, breaking into pieces. In the part of 
   the film people remember most about this film, one piece of the 
   creature delivers a mutated baby, which tries to kill Jake. Jake 
   thinks he chokes the baby to death with its own umbilical cord but, 
   as the final shot shows us, the baby gets up and the film freezes on 
   its image.&nbsp; As you can imagine, the story makes no sense at all 
   (DeCocteau wrote the screenplay with Burford Hauser; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Blood Nasty">BLOOD
    NA$TY</A></B> - 1989), but it is an entertaining 72 minutes that 
   gave audiences what they wanted: blood, boobs and gore. This was one 
   of Charles Band's Empire Films (he was the uncredited Executive 
   Producer) and it was apparent he gave David DeCoteau very little 
   money and told DeCoteau to give him what audiences wanted, story be 
   damned, This film is just weird enough to merit a viewing (I have 
   seen it about 20 times) and since it was one of DeCoteau's first few 
   horror films (porn directors know how to squeeze every penny out of a 
   buck), he gives us much more on screen then some established genre 
   director would. The success of this film (and a few others), would 
   make DeCoteau a house director at Full Moon when Empire Pictures 
   folded, where he would have to take pseudonyms, like &quot;Ellen 
   Cabot&quot; (a credit he used on this film as an Associate Producer), 
   &quot;Richard Chasen&quot;, &quot;Julian Breen&quot;, &quot;Mary 
   Crawford&quot; , Victoria Sloan&quot; and at least a half-dozen 
   others so people wouldn't think that DeCoteau was directing 80% of 
   Full Moon's features every year or working in so many capacities on a 
   film (He used the pseudonym &quot;David McCabe&quot; when directing 
   all-male and straight porn films and really is a jack-of-all trades 
   when it comes to filmmaking. I doubt there isn't one thing he could 
   do better than most artists). This film packs an awful lot into a 
   small amount of time and makes it one of my guiltiest of pleasures. 
   While David DeCoteau will never win an Academy Award for his body of 
   work, he has given millions of people countless nights of great genre 
   exploitation. David is still working up to this day, so expect to see 
   reviews of his films <B><A HREF="knock_em_dead_2014.htm">KNOCK </A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="knock_em_dead_2014.htm">'</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><A HREF="knock_em_dead_2014.htm">EM

   laughed my ass off at the absurdity of it all. It was obvious 
   DeCoteau was just having fun at/with the audience's expectations with 
   these films and it worked. I can't think of a nicer guy all this 
   success is happening to. Cinematographer/Second Unit Director/Special 
   Effects Supervisor Thomas Calloway directed the ridiculously bad film <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HeebieJeebies2012">HEEBIE
    JEEBIES</A></B> (2012). You have to see it to believe it (Or read my 
   review by clicking on the link). Released on VHS by Amazing 
   Factory/Cult Video and even though the <A HREF="full_moons_grindhouse_collection_ad.htm">Full
    Moon Grindhouse Collection</A> DVD series always get a bad 
   reputation, besides the DVD being in fullscreen, the picture was 
   sharp and looked great on my Blu-Ray and HD TV system. Only their 
   first ten releases looked like they were taken from video masters. 
   Their newer releases look great, so don't let what other people say 
   dissuade you from purchasing the DVD. I actually paid $4.98 for it on <A HREF="http://www.oldies.com">Oldies.Com</A>.
    That is a bargain at 4 times the price. Full Moon has finally

    We then see a jewelry store owner being tricked into believing his 
   store is about to be robbed by thieves. Three police officers show up 
   at his locked jewelry store and the owner hands one of them the keys, 
   telling him and his partner to be careful. A short time later the two 
   officers exit the store and tell the owner that there is no one 
   inside and that his store has not been robbed. The third officer 
   tells the owner that he will have to come to the station and fill out 
   a report and he drives him to the station. It is at this time we 
   discover that they are not the police at all; they are thieves 
   working for crime boss Rudy (John Steiner; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#PlotOfFear1976">PLOT
    OF FEAR</A></B> - 1976). The owner has handed the two 
   &quot;officers&quot; the keys to his store and they rob him blind as 
   their partner drives him to the police station. The third 
   &quot;officer&quot; is brazen enough to actually drop off the owner 
   inside the police station and leave him there, unaware that his store 
   is being emptied of all its valuable jewelry. Yes, criminals in Rome 
   are getting inventive in the way they do business, as the &quot;normal

    We then meet Police Officer Baldi (Leonard Mann; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#DeathStepsDark1977">DEATH
    STEPS IN THE DARK</A></B> - 1977), who is part of Rome's Mobile 
   Squad. He meets a former police officer named Rampelli (Ettore Manni; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#SilverSaddle1978">SILVER
    SADDLE</A></B> - 1978) at a park and he wants Baldi to head up a 
   special squad he is thinking of creating to fight the rampant crime 
   that is infecting Rome. Rampelli tells Baldi that he will have more 
   freedom than a normal police officer as himself will have when 
   dealing with criminals. Baldi is skeptical of Rampelli's claims, but 
   when he mentions that this new squad's goal is to stop three of 
   Rome's worst criminals, namely The Owl, Rudy and The Messino, who are 
   controlled by The Prince (we are only introduced to Rudy and The 
   Prince in this film), it gets Baldi's attention. Rampelli tells Baldi 
   that he has no proof that The Prince is behind most of the crimes 
   since he is considered &quot;above suspicion&quot; by law enforcement 
   and the judicial system. It also doesn't help that no one even likes 
   to mention The Prince's name, in fear that they will be murdered for 
   doing so. Baldi tells Rampelli that he will have to think about 
   heading up this new special squad since it could get him fired (or 
   worse) from his job, so Rampelli grabs a pen from Baldi's jacket 
   pocket (Baldi tells him not to use that pen and gives him a 
   &quot;better&quot; one) and writes down his phone number on a 
   business card and hands it to him, saying when he comes to a decision 
   to call him. Baldi is sick and tired of Italy's justice system and 
   looks at this secret squad as a way for him to get justice his way, 
   but joining such a squad could have severe consequences, so he has 
   Rampelli secretly assist him with his investigation to see if he is 
   up to snuff to create such a squad.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   the haul from robberies everyone gets, from the Mafia bosses right 
   down to even the most insignificant of people who were hardly 
   involved in the crimes. Since The Prince sets the prices of hauls, it 
   upsets the three thieves, because he lowballs the prices on stolen 
   goods, giving them a lower amount of money than they actually deserve 
   (and The Prince pocketing the rest).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Baldi then goes undercover as a thief to set up Rudy. While they

   notices a funeral procession slowly driving by and become suspicious. 
   Turns out he was right and the procession is staffed by undercover 
   cops. Baldi tells Rudy he is under arrest and a gunfight breaks out 
   between the cops and Rudy's gang and Rudy manages to escape unharmed. 
   Baldi doesn't know Rampelli is crooked as a corkscrew, as he is 
   feeding Rudy vital information, keeping him one step ahead of the 
   police. Rudy orders Rampelli to find out who set him up with the 
   police, promising Rampelli a hefty reward for doing so. Baldi then 
   meets the beautiful wheelchair-bound Laura Olivieri (Maria Rosaria

   him up and then shoot and kill him. It is revealed to the audience

    It turns out Laura is good friends with Professor Salviati and

   daughter he never had, but Laura has no idea it was he who murdered 
   her father. Some higher-up Mafia dons tell The Prince that Rudy is 
   getting out of hand and his actions could get them all sent to

   &quot;old fashioned way.&quot; Three men in ski masks beat up Baldi

   brought to his office on trumped-up charges and asks him, &quot;Did 
   you ever see a beetle die? They'll do the same thing as you. You're 
   good for the little jobs...Low risk...Preying on people who can't 
   defend themselves. You know what I mean.&quot; He then asks Rudy if 
   he owns a yellow, orange and blue checkered sports jacket and Rudy 
   says yes, he has many of them, wanting to know if it is illegal to 
   own them. Yes, Rudy is a smartass.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Rudy figures out that Rampelli is working both sides of the fence, 
   so he kidnaps him and locks him in a room. The Prince sends some of 
   his men to tell Rudy that he wants peace, but first he is to deliver 
   Rampelli to him and then they will have dinner together as a peace 
   offering. Rudy isn't stupid and instantly doesn't trust The Prince, 
   so he forces Rampelli to phone Baldi and tell him to meet him, he has 
   some important information to tell him. When Baldi shows up at the 
   meeting place, Rampelli gets a flash of conscience and tells Baldi to 
   hit the dirt, it's a set-up. Baldi does just that, but Rudy's men 
   shoot Rampelli in the back and kill him. Rudy then goes to The 
   Prince's house for dinner and, just like in the beginning of the 
   film, The Prince pulls out his gold-plated automatic weapon and 
   shoots Rudy, killing him (Rudy's final words are, &quot;You really 
   are a son of a bitch!&quot;). Baldi then gets a phone call, telling 
   him &quot;a friend&quot; is waiting for him in a building he knows 
   well. When Baldi gets there, he finds Rudy dead on the floor and 
   written in paint next to his body is a note that reads &quot;The 
   Friends Are Vindicated.&quot; Rudy is now wearing the yellow, orange 
   and blue checkered sports jacket, but is he really the one who 
   ransacked Baldi's home and killed his dog? Inside the jacket pocket 
   is a photo of Rudy posing with the bodies of the three dead Mafia 
   dons, as if to point the finger at Rudy as their killer. Baldi thinks 
   the photo is strange because Rudy was not the type of man who would 
   pose for a photo with dead bodies. He is obviously right, as the real 
   killer is stalking Laura in her home as she tries to pull her 
   lifeless lower body up a flight of stairs to avoid the approaching 
   killer. Will Baldi be able to save his new lady love? We then 
   discover a surprise or two and if I told you what they were 
   (especially why Baldi keeps two pens in his jacket) it would ruin 
   your enjoyment of the film should you choose to watch it (And, no, 
   Laura cannot walk!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This was one of director/co-writer (with Paolo Barberio; <B><A HREF="best_1976.htm">THE

   Leonard Mann). This is a very slow-moving Eurocrime flick with very 
   few action scenes, but it is never boring, thanks to John Steiner's 
   performance (I don't know about you, but Steiner gives off a very 
   strong gay vibe whenever I see him on screen, causing my 
   &quot;gaydar&quot; to go off repeatedly, but, hey, there's nothing 
   wrong with that! I do have some gay friends and they taught me how to 
   spot a gay person in a crowd. Steiner meets all those criteria. No 
   matter what I think, there's no denying that Steiner is fun to watch 
   on screen.), and the film's insistence that the story is more 
   important than action. That doesn't mean there is no violence here; 
   as the threat of violence permeates nearly every frame of film. You 
   never know who is the next to die, which is this film's strongest 
   point. Italy, especially Rome, was infested with crime and violent 
   murders throughout the '70s and this film is a window that shows us 
   how bad it really was and how criminals used new and inventive ways 
   (such as the jewelry store robbery) to obtain their goals. It wasn't 
   unheard of back then for the police to be involved in criminal 
   activities, as many prominent law officials were on the take to Mafia 
   dons, making it downright impossible for honest cops, such as Baldi, 
   to do their jobs. And the justice system in Italy at the time was 
   just as bad, if not worse, as judges and court officials were also 
   getting paid graft by the Mafia, throwing cases and perverting 
   justice for monetary gain, making it impossible for honest cops to 
   put criminals and murderers in prison. It wasn't unheard of for 
   honest cops to murder their prey because it was the only way for them 
   to get justice. This film shines a light on that problem and I 
   therefore recommend it. Just don't expect a slam-bang actioner and 
   you may enjoy yourself.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    CANNONS</A></B> [1990]), has fashioned what is probably one of the 
   best psychological horror/gore films of the 1970's. When Andy Brooks 
   (Richard Backus) is shot and killed in Vietnam, the Brooks family is 
   notified by the Army of his demise. Andy's overly-devoted mother, 
   Christine (Lynn Carlin) refuses to believe her son is dead and wishes 
   for his return home. Her wish comes true as Andy shows up at their 
   door, not quite acting himself. He has in fact turned into an undead 
   zombie that needs the blood of the living to keep him from rotting 
   away. Andy's alcoholic father, Charles (John Marley) knows something 
   is wrong with Andy after he witnesses him killing the family dog in 
   front of a bunch of children (a truly horrifying scene). Andy's 
   sister, Cathy (Anya Ormsby, wife of screenwriter Alan Ormsby) is just 
   glad that he is home, even if Mother always liked him best. Charles 
   brings the family doctor (Henderson Forsythe) to check Andy out, but 
   Andy refuses and later shows up at the good doctor's office and kills 
   him by stabbing him repeatedly with a hypodermic needle, injecting 
   the doctor's blood into his veins to stave off the decomposition of 
   his flesh. Things really get out of hand when Cathy sets up Andy on a 
   double date with his old girlfriend Joanne (Jane Daly) and Cathy's 
   boyfriend Bob (Michael Mazes). They go to a drive-in and Andy kills 
   Joanne and Bob, runs over an innocent bystander and drives home to 
   Mother as he begins to literally fall apart. Charles tries to kill 
   Andy with a pistol, but cannot do it because he's still his son and 
   uses the gun on himself instead, committing suicide. Mom drives Andy 
   to get away with the police in hot pursuit. Andy makes her stop at a 
   cemetery, where earlier he dug a grave and scratched his name on a 
   tombstone with his name, birth date and death date. He literally<A HREF="dead_of_night_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/dead of night aka deathdream ad mat small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="327" HEIGHT="99" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="2"></A> 
   throws dirt on himself before passing away, his flesh peeling away 
   from his body. There's a lot of subtext in this film concerning the 
   Vietnam war that would be lost on audiences today. That's OK, because 
   the film holds up as a truly frightening horror film with good 
   performances by all, some early gore effects by Tom Savini and the 
   last 20 minutes are the best twenty minutes of any horror film of 
   its' time. The scene where Joanne discovers Andy's forehead beginning 
   to blister open and drip yellow goo while trapped in the back seat of 
   a car at the drive-in is a scene you're likely to never forget and 
   Andy's final decomposition is handled for pure shock value. Many 
   people find the first hour of this film slow going, but I think that 
   director Clark and screenwriter Ormsby build the suspense to the 
   breaking point before all hell breaks loose. Drastically cut when 
   shown on TV in the 70's, you'll be surprised how much you missed when 
   viewing the videotape. This is one of those films known under a 
   myriad of titles, including: <B>THE NIGHT ANDY CAME HOME</B>, <B><A HREF="dead_of_night_1972.htm">DEAD

   brings Khorda to the local hippie commune. Khorda quickly becomes the 
   commune's spiritual leader, spouting philosophical mumbo-jumbo and 
   performing magical acts that put a sense of awe and wonder into the 
   commune's long-haired occupants. Khorda begins putting the bite on 
   the commune's residents, turning them into crazed, bongo-dancing 
   vampires. The disappearances and strange behaviour of some of the 
   commune's population bring out the suspicions of Pico (Bill Ewing), 
   the local Indian hippie who has the moves of Billy Jack. With his 
   girlfriend, Rona (Brenda Dickson), they try to escape the commune, 
   only to be stopped at every turn by Barbado and<A HREF="deathmaster_1972b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/deathmaster ad mat small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="84" HEIGHT="361" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   a growing horde of vampires. After they are captured, Pico refuses 
   Khorda's offer to become a vampire and escapes his shackles in the 
   commune's subterranean basement. He finds Khorda's resting place and 
   accidentally sticks his hand in a bowl of leeches. He disables 
   Barbado by drawing a cross on his face with his leech-drained blood 
   and escapes to town where he seeks the help of Pop (John Fiedler), 
   the local store owner. Pop doesn't believe Pico's story, even when 
   his dog is found dead with two puncture wounds on his neck. Pop 
   becomes hip when the local motorcycle tough is found dead and members 
   of the commune act like zombies in his store. Pico and Pop bring the 
   police to the commune, where Khorda convinces the cops that nothing 
   is wrong. Rona, under Khorda's control, refuses to leave the commune. 
   It's up to Pico and Pop to stop Khorda before the &quot;incubation 
   time&quot; expires and everyone at the commune become full-fledged

    RED</A><A NAME="DeepRed1975"></A> (1975) -</B> There is no doubt in 
   my mind that Dario Argento was the master of the giallo film during 
   the '70s &amp; '80s. This film is considered his crowning achievement 
   (even though I like <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Tenebre1982">TENEBRE</A></B> 
   [1982] better) and it is easy to see why. It is a masterwork of 
   visual delights, mixing some sly comic moments with graphic scenes of 
   death. It is also one of Argento's better-acted films, helped in part 
   by David Hemmings (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Nightmare1973">NIGHTMARE</A></B> 
   - 1973) and Daria Nicolodi's (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Shock1977">SHOCK</A></B> 
   - 1977) natural on-screen chemistry. Before I get into the plot of 
   this film, there are a couple of things you should know.&nbsp; First 
   off, when Argento directed this film<A HREF="deep_red_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/deep red blu-ray front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="260" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>,
    there was no such thing as home video, so when the first murder 
   happens, there is a quick flash of the killer's face, which can 
   easily be seen when advancing the film frame-by-frame in slow motion 
   and freezing the frame when advancing the disc in a DVD or Blu-Ray 
   player. I would advise you don't do this, especially if you have 
   never seen the film before, because it will destroy the film for you. 
   Secondly, if you want to see the on-screen chemistry between Hemmings 
   and Nicolodi, you'll have to watch the complete 126-minute 
   &quot;Director's Cut&quot; of the film, as the 105-minute English 
   language cut deletes most of the romantic wordplay and sexual energy 
   between them (but not the film's gory violence). Even worse is the 
   100-minute U.S. theatrical R-Rated cut, which not only omits that 
   chemistry, it also is missing most of the graphic gore and deaths, 
   something Argento is a master at. The 100-minute version is a 
   complete joke, so please ignore it, as it is only a shadow of a great 
   giallo film. With that out of the way, let's get to the film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film opens with some creepy children's music playing, as we see 
   and hear a murder take place (in silhouette, as shadows on a wall) in 
   a room of a house (notice the Christmas tree on the right). We hear a 
   scream and a bloody knife falls to the floor and a faceless young 
   child walks up to it (we only see the child's shoes). We are then at 
   a parapsychology conference, where Professor Giordini (Glauco Mauri) 
   and Mr. Bardi (Piero Mazzinghi; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#ApacheWoman1976">APACHE
    WOMAN</A></B> - 1976) introduce world-renown psychic medium Helga 
   Ulmann (Macha Meril; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Night Train Murders">NIGHT
    TRAIN MURDERS</A></B> - 1974) to their audience of doctors, 
   scientists and naysayers. Helga tells them she can see thoughts the 
   instant they are formed and some thoughts are so strong, <FONT COLOR="NAVY"><B>&quot;they
    linger around the room, like cobwebs.&quot;</B></FONT> She proves it 
   by telling one member of the audience that he is holding keys in his 
   hand and even tells him his name, even though they have never met. 
   Suddenly, Helga picks up some very violent thoughts, telling someone 
   in the audience, <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;I can feel...death in 
   this room. I feel a presence. A twisted mind, sending thoughts. 
   Perverted, murderous thoughts. Go away! You have killed...and you 
   will kill again. There is a child, singing, in that house. 
   Death...Blood...All blood! I'm scared! I'm scared! We must hide 
   everything, everything in the house back the way it was. No one must 
   know, no one, no one! Forget it, forget it, forget it...forever...forever.&quot;</FONT></B>&nbsp;
    We see an audience member's point of view as they get up and leave 
   the auditorium while Helga expresses these violent thoughts she is 
   picking up. When Helga comes to, she tells Professor Giordini that 
   she has to go home and write down what she experienced, telling the 
   Professor that she now knows the name of the monstrous murderer and 
   she will tell him all about it tomorrow morning, not knowing that the 
   murderer is hiding in the auditorium and has heard everything Helga 
   has said (earlier, we see the murderer walking into the auditorium 
   bathroom and putting on a pair of black leather gloves that zip-up in 
   the back). Helen does sense something, but she believes the strong, 
   murderous thoughts are still lingering in the room. That night, Helga 
   is talking on the phone to her agent when she hears the creepy 
   children's music and someone rings her doorbell. She goes to open her 
   door to her lush apartment, but those strange thoughts envelop her 
   and she backs away from the door, only to have the killer kick the 
   door open and attack Helga with a butcher's cleaver (lots of quick 
   flashes of blood and gore). The killer takes Helga's notes and the 
   film cuts to jazz pianist teacher Marcus Daly (David Hemmings; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Dark Forces 1983">DARK
    FORCES</A></B> - 1980) meeting his drunken pianist friend Carlo 
   (Gabriele Lavia; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BeyondTheDoor1974">BEYOND
    THE DOOR</A></B> - 1974) on the street as he is walking home (he 
   lives in the same apartment building as Helga). As they are talking, 
   they hear a woman screaming and a drunk Carlo tells Marcus that 
   someone is probably getting raped, making a joke out of it (like any 
   drunk would, raising his bottle of booze in the air and saying, <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;Hail
    to the raped virgin!&quot;</FONT></B>). Carlo tells Marcus <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;As
    long as I'm drunk, I'm happy as a lark. And I play better, too! The 
   difference between you and me is purely political. You see, we both 
   play good piano, right? </FONT></B>(Marco waves his hands back and 
   forth, as if to say, &quot;Not really.&quot;)<B><FONT COLOR="NAVY"> 
   But I'm the proletarian of the keyboard and you're the bourgeois. You 
   play for art and you enjoy it. I play for survival. That's not the 
   same thing.&quot;</FONT></B> Carlo then leaves to go to his job as a 
   pianist at a blues bar. As Marcus continues walking home, he sees 
   Helga getting her face pushed through one of her windows (an Argento 
   trademark) and then sees someone plant the cleaver in her back. 
   Marcus runs to her apartment, passing a corridor in her apartment 
   full of paintings (DO NOT advance this sequence frame-by-frame if you 
   do not want to know who the killer is!) and finds Helga dead, her 
   neck impaled on shards of glass. Marcus runs to the window and sees 
   someone wearing a long brown leather raincoat hurriedly walking away. 
   When the police arrive, Marcus tells Captain Calcabrini (Eros Pagni) 
   about seeing a person in a brown leather raincoat walking away, yet 
   when he walks past the corridor again, he gets the feeling that 
   something is missing, thinking it is a painting (like in most of 
   Argento's giallo films, memory is key to uncovering the mystery). The 
   Captain tells Marcus that no paintings are missing, but Marcus is 
   sure something is not the same and it will haunt him to the point 
   that he will try to solve this murder on his own. Also at the scene 
   of the crime is feisty newspaper reporter Gianna Brezzi (Daria 
   Nicolodi; Argento's <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Terror Opera">OPERA</A></B> 
   - 1987), who latches on to Marcus as a source for the story and will 
   not let go (almost literally). When Marcus leaves the apartment, he 
   sees Carlo and asks him if he saw someone wearing a brown coat 
   walking away and he tells Marcus, <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;You 
   know, sometimes what you actually see and what you imagine...get 
   mixed up in your memory like a cocktail...from which you can no 
   longer distinguish one flavor from another. It happens to me all the time.&quot;</FONT></B> 
   Those words give the usually insecure Marcus the impetus to solve the 
   murder on his own, but he will get help from the inquisitive Gianni, 
   who has the know-how and contacts to get things done quicker than he 
   could on his own. At Helga's Hebrew funeral, Gianna give Marcus the 
   skinny on Professor Giordani, telling him that he's a professor of 
   psychiatry, but he's mad about parapsychology. Giordani and Helga 
   were much more than friends, telling Marcus that Giordani practically 
   kept Helga. She also tells Marcus about Mr. Bardi. He is an expert in 
   paranormal phenomena and is also a clairvoyant.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Marcus is certain that Carlo is not telling him all he knows, so he 
   goes to Carlo's home, only to discover that he lives with his ditzy 
   mother Martha (Clara Calamai; <B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#Obsession1943">OBSESSION</A></B>&nbsp;
    - 1943), a former actress who has pictures of herself hanging on a 
   wall (Actual photos of actress Calamai in the films she starred in 
   the '30s &amp; '40s). Marcus also discovers that Carlo is gay 
   (Handled in a manner that is deeply touching for a giallo film. In 
   other words, Marcus doesn't treat him like some pervert, but still 
   like a friend), but it doesn't deter him from asking some important 
   questions. While Marcus is working on a new piano composition in his 
   apartment, he starts hearing the children's music and quickly locks 
   the door to his piano room. The killer whispers from behind the 
   locked door, <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;This time you're safe. I'll 
   kill you anyway, sooner or later.&quot;</FONT></B> Marcus becomes 
   obsessed with <A HREF="deep_red_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/deep red poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="195" HEIGHT="313" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>that
    child's tune and finds a record of it in a music store. He plays it 
   for Professor Giordani and Mr. Bardi and Giordani tells Marcus that 
   the song may very well be the leitmotif of the crimes. <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;The
    murderer is a schizophrenic paranoid. Anyone who kills with such 
   frenzy surely does it in a state of temporary madness. In everyday 
   life, this person could appear quite normal. As normal as you or I or 
   anyone else. And when he kills he must recreate these specific 
   conditions, which will trigger the release of all his pent-up 
   madness. Something that recreates the same images that frame a 
   context that provoked trauma in the past&quot;</FONT></B> (Remember, 
   Giordani is a psychiatrist). Mr. Bardi interjects and says, <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;I'd
    like to add something less scientific to this business about the 
   children's song. If you recall, Helga also mentioned a house, as well 
   as a child singing. I remember having read a little book quite some 
   time ago on folklore. I think the title was 'The Modern Ghost And The 
   Black Legends Of Today'. The author spoke about a haunted house from 
   which neighbors could sometimes hear singing, like that of a child. 
   The conjecture is that an act of bloodshed was once committed in that house.&quot;</FONT></B> 
   Marcus asks Mr. Bardi if he still has the book and he says no, but if 
   Marcus wants to find it, he should try The Library Of Folklore And 
   Popular Traditions.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Marcus finds the book and the author's name is Amanda Righetti. The 
   book contains a photo of a house and Marcus (who rips the page out of 
   the book while the library's guard is not looking) begins an 
   investigation to locate the house, his first step being contacting 
   Amanda Righetti. Marcus phones Gianna at a coffee bar (a very funny 
   scene) and asks her to find an address for Righetti, telling Gianna 
   that Amanda must know where the house is located. We then see that 
   Amanda Righetti (Giuliana Calandra; <B><A HREF="convoy_buddies_1975.htm">CONVOY
    BUDDIES</A></B> - 1975) is a collector of myna birds (!) and before 
   she can talk to Marcus, the killer leaves a naked doll hanging by its 
   neck in her home and then kills her by immersing her head in a 
   bathtub full of scalding hot water, but before she dies, she writes 
   something in the steam that has collected on the wall. Marcus then 
   arrives at her house and finds Amanda dead, along with all her myna 
   birds (Remember, these birds can talk!). Marcus leaves the house 
   without telling the police (being the first person at two murder 
   scenes is just too much for the police to overlook), but Professor 
   Giordani offers to go to the house to investigate further, especially 
   when Marcus tells him about Amanda pointing at the wall, as if she 
   was trying to say something. Giordani discovers what Amanda has 
   written by running the hot water taps in the bathroom and steaming up 
   the walls, but before he can tell Marcus what she had written (It 
   reads <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;It Was...&quot;</FONT></B>, but we 
   don't see the rest of the message), the killer strikes and bashes 
   Giordani's teeth against the edge of a fireplace mantle and his a 
   desk over and over (much in the way as the hard-to-watch curbside 
   death in <B><A HREF="american_history_x_1998.htm">AMERICAN HISTORY X</A></B> 
   - 1998) and then stabbing him through the neck, pinning him to the 
   desk, a pool of blood slowly forming on the floor (This comes after a 
   nerve-wracking scene of a mechanical doll rapidly approaching 
   Giordani through a door in his office. It doesn't make much sense, 
   but there's no denying that it is an effective, scary scene).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Marcus tells Gianna that he is not going to tell anyone (not even 
   her) his next move, asking Gianna how the killer knew he was going to 
   talk to Amanda. Marcus notices some strange foliage in the photo of 
   the house and a florist tells him it's a rare plant only found on the 
   Easter Islands, but one house nearby purchased it years ago. It leads 
   Marcus to &quot;The House Of The Screaming Child&quot;. He also 
   notices something else in the photo: A window in the house that is no 
   longer there. Long story short, it leads Marcus to a secret hidden 
   room, containing the desiccated corpse of the murder victim from the 
   beginning of the film. Before Marcus can investigate any further, he 
   is knocked out and when he wakes up, Gianna is beside him and the 
   house is in flames (an obvious model of the house). Marcus still has 
   one final clue. It's a child's drawing depicting a murder that leads 
   him to the archives of a school, where he discovers the child's name 
   who drew it in the mid-1950s. Marcus believes he has the identity of 
   the killer, but he is in for a rude awakening. I'm not about to tell 
   you who the killer is (although they are mentioned in this review), 
   but the way the killer is dispatched will come as quite the gory 
   surprise to those who have only seen the abortive 100-minute edit of 
   this film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This may be Dario Argento's most visual film of his career, as the 
   camera (cinematography by Luigi Kuveiller; strangely, his only film 
   for Argento; he did the cinematography on Elio Petri's <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#QuietPlaceCountry68">A
    QUIET PLACE IN THE COUNTRY</A></B> [1968]; Lucio Fulci's <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#LizardWomansSkin">A
    LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN</A></B> [1971]; and Lamberto Bava's <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#BodyPuzzle1992">BODY
    PUZZLE</A></B> [1992]) becomes a character unto itself. It glides 
   over children's toys on a desktop, surprising us by then displaying 
   murder weapons among the toys (including two switchblades with dried 
   blood on the blades). It shows us the miniature tape recorder as it 
   plays the haunting children's tune (music by Giorgio Gaslini and 
   Goblin; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BeyondTheDarkness79">BEYOND 
   THE DARKNESS</A></B> - 1979; this being their first music score for 
   Argento; they would also supply music for his <B><A HREF="#Phenomena1984">PHENOMENA</A></B> 
   [1984] and <B><A HREF="sleepless_2001.htm">SLEEPLESS</A></B> [2001]) 
   and it glides across scenes like a low-flying cloud, giving the film 
   a dreamy (or rather, nightmarish) quality lacking from most giallo 
   films. There's no denying that Argento gets what he wants in a scene, 
   because it is easy to see that many of the shots were well 
   thought-out and achieved with plenty of sweat and imagination 
   (especially how the camera glides across Marcus at the end of the 
   film, as he is about to re-enter Helga's apartment). Like I said 
   earlier, the walking mechanical doll may not make a lot of sense, but 
   there's no disputing that it has a visceral energy that slaps the 
   viewer across the face. Rather than making us mad, it actually shocks 
   us. While I prefer the 105-minute cut of the film (maybe it's because 
   it was the only version I saw before the full version was released on 
   DVD &amp; Blu-Ray, but more on that in the next paragraph), the 
   126-minute version does answer some nagging questions I always had 
   with the film, like how Marcus knew the House With The Screaming 
   Child contained plants indigenous to The Easter Islands (or how he 
   knew about the plants and the house at all) and other reveals, which 
   made no sense in the 105-minute version, but are cleared up in the 
   126-minute version. If you have never seen this film before, I would 
   advise that you watch the most complete version so you won't have any 
   questions when the film ends. This film also has some sublimely comic 
   scenes, such as Gianni's junker of a car (and how Marcus and Gianna 
   get out of it), what happens when Marcus tells Gianna that women are 
   the &quot;weaker&quot; sex (They get into an arm wrestling contest 
   and Gianna wins...twice!) and the way Martha keeps forgetting that 
   Marcus is a pianist, referring to him over-and-over as an engineer. <A HREF="deep_red_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/deep red italy poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="307" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Those
    who think that Argento lacks a sense of humor should check this film 
   out. The screenplay, by Argento and Bernardino Zapponi (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#PlotOfFear1976">PLOT
    OF FEAR</A></B> - 1976), is full of little humorous asides, 
   especially in the 126-minute version. This version contains a scene 
   in the beginning when Marcus is teaching jazz to some students. He 
   tells them they are playing extremely well, but jazz shouldn't be 
   played &quot;clean&quot;, it should be played &quot;trashy&quot;, a 
   telling moment about Marcus' frame of mind. The film is also full of 
   nasty, gory violence. One scene I failed to mention is one character 
   getting dragged behind a truck while attached to a chain. As the 
   truck makes a sharp turn, his head smashes against a curb and a car 
   runs over his head, crushing it like a grape. The cleaver attacks are 
   also very gory, as is the killer's demise. Blood flows like a fine 
   bottle of wine, leaving red puddles everywhere (especially in the 
   closing shot). Need I say any more?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This stark, but eerily beautiful, black &amp; white film then shows 
   Purificazione (Daliah Lavi; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#WhipAndTheBody1963">THE
    WHIP AND THE BODY</A></B> - 1963), whom everyone calls 
   &quot;Puri&quot; (so I will, too), sticking a pin in her right breast 
   and dabbing the blood with a white cloth. She then cuts some locks of 
   her black hair off with scissors and wraps them in the bloody cloth. 
   She then goes to an old wood burning stove in the kitchen and places 
   the bloody cloth in the embers of the fire. She sits and waits for 
   about a minute, opens the stove's iron door and retrieves the burnt 
   remnants of the bloody cloth, puts them on the kitchen table and 
   mashes the remnants together with her hands into the shape of a ball, 
   but she is interrupted when she hears her mother yell to her father 
   Vincenzo to wake up the boys, bedtime is over, forcing Puri to hide 
   the ball in a small loaf of bread. Vincenzo yells out for Puri, 
   wondering why she is not in her room. The scissors then fall to the 
   floor, one of its blades sticking in the floor in the shape of a 
   makeshift crucifix, but Puri grabs the scissors and puts it to her 
   face, staring intensely through the holes in the handles into the 
   nothingness, the scissors acting like some strange mask. I think we 
   can guess what she is trying to do, as some may call her insane or 
   mentally disturbed, but it may not be that at all (or it could very 
   well be). Is it possible that Puri may be in the early stages of 
   demonic possession or is there a more rational explanation? Puri then 
   takes the loaf of bread, dresses all in black, walks outside and 
   enters the local church, while the townspeople inside&nbsp; begin 
   whispering to each other, &quot;What little shame she has. How dare 
   she come to the church.&quot; (They think she is a witch). Puri walks 
   over to the priest performing Mass, kneels before him, clutching the 
   loaf of bread tightly in her hands, but when the priest sees her, he 
   turns his back on her and refuses to give her Communion. Puri says, 
   &quot;Blood of Christ. Demon. A curse upon this man. A curse that he 
   will never forget me. Blood of my body. Until the grave. A curse that 
   he will never forget me.&quot; The people kneeling beside her are 
   visibly shaken and horrified. Is Puri cursing the priest? We will 
   soon find out.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next time we see Puri, she is walking home, but she stops to spy 
   on Antonio (Frank Wolff; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#DeathWalksHeels1971">DEATH
    WALKS ON HIGH HEELS</A></B> - 1971), who is petting a dog. Puri has 
   a look of lust in her eyes and follows Antonio as he walks away, 
   keeping her distance so he doesn't notice her (When Antonio takes a 
   drink from his canteen, we see Puri licking her lips. I think that 
   tells us more than words could ever imply). Antonio walks down a 
   steep hill and through some thick brush, still not noticing that Puri 
   is following him. Or does he? He then sits down with three women (one 
   of them is nursing a baby) and one of them says, &quot;Antonio, why 
   have you come here?&quot; Another older (and dentally challenged) 
   woman asks, &quot;To check on the hope chest of your fiancee? Do you 
   not trust us?&quot; Antonio responds, &quot;Oh, I have no doubt that 
   her hope chest will be lovely. As will be my fiancee. And as will be 
   everything associated with her, if it pleases our Lord. I happen to 
   be in the neighborhood and I thought i would stop in to pay my 
   respects.&quot; That is obviously a lie when you take into 
   considertion the rough route Antonio had to walk. Antonio also lies 
   when he tells one of the women he wanted to see how she and her 
   daughters were doing. He also says that the marriage ceremony and the 
   arrangements are all taken care of, while Puri watches him from a 
   long distance away, unable to hear what he is saying. Antonio also 
   tells the three women (one of whom will be his mother-in-law) that he 
   has already settled his accounts and doesn't owe anyone, neither God 
   or man, so the wedding should be clear sailing, His toothless future 
   mother-in-law looks at him and says, &quot;To God always, Antonio. We 
   are always indebted to Him.&quot; Antonio says that God will bless 
   him with many children and the nursing woman asks him if he wants a 
   lot of children. Antonio says yes, he has already figured out all of 
   their names, but he cannot tell them what those names are because 
   once spoken, the names lose their charm and are lost forever. I know 
   what you are thinking. What does any of this have to do with the film 
   at hand? Quite simply, to show that this is a deeply religious town 
   that depends on God and all it means, maybe a little too much. But, 
   as the old saying goes, &quot;If you believe in God than you must

    As Antonio is walking home, he is stopped by Puri, who wants to know 
   why he is ignoring her. He says he has never pursued her and isn't 
   interested in her, telling her he is about to be married to another 
   woman. Puri says he may not want her, but she wants him, pulling him 
   to the ground, where they begin kissing and getting a little 
   touchy-feely. Antonio realizes what he is doing, gets up and begins 
   walking away, but Puri stops him and says if he will share a drink of 
   wine with her, she will stop pursuing him. Puri grabs his canteen and 
   pours the contents of what she put in the bread into his canteen and 
   then takes a drink from it, handing the canteen to Antonio, who is 
   also about to take a drink. Just before Antonio takes a drink, Puri 
   wants him to say, &quot;So that you rest&quot; before taking a drink, 
   but he refuses, saying those are the words of the dead. When he 
   drinks, Puri screams out, &quot;With that wine you have drunk my 
   blood! You have drunk my body and my substance! I have bewitched you! 
   Now you will love me whether you want to or not! Have no fear! But if 
   you do fear, all the worse! You will go to ruin! Misfortune will 
   befall you! I have bewitched you!&quot;, then she runs away. Antonio 
   believes every word she says, as he throws his canteen to the ground 
   and stomps on it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Puri lying on the floor of her bedroom talking to 
   herself and saying Antonio is a traitor. If he doesn't start loving 
   her, she will make sure he is dead. She hears footsteps approaching 
   and jumps into bed, pulling the covers over her head. Her father, 
   mother and two brothers enter the room and surround the bed, her 
   father pulling the covers off her and saying he knows she is only 
   pretending to sleep. He begins to viciously whip her with a leather 
   strap. After a short time, her mother begs him to stop, saying Puri 
   has had enough. The brothers intervene, stopping their father from 
   punishing Puri so harshly. It takes a lot of intervening to get good 
   old Dad to stop whipping Puri, as he yells out, &quot;I know what 
   horrible things you've done!&quot; It takes both brothers and Mom to 
   stop Dad, the mother telling him that she doesn't think their 
   daughter did such a horrible thing. They all then leave the bedroom, 
   with Puri lying on<A HREF="demon_1963.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/demon 1963 british poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="232" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>

    The next day, we see Antonio and his bride-to-be (Rossana Revere; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#QuietPlaceKill1970">A
    QUIET PLACE TO KILL</A></B> - 1970) walking to the church for their 
   wedding ceremony, while the church bells ring out loudly and Puri 
   watches the ceremony from a safe distance away (Truth be told, 
   Antonio's&nbsp; bride looks very plain and homely when compared to 
   Puri. Let's face it, she's downright fugly!). Puri, who once again 
   dresses all in black, looks heartbroken, as we watch the wedding 
   ceremony inside the church, where the candle on the bride's side 
   starts to flicker and get dimmer. One member in the church can be 
   heard saying that if the candle goes out, it means a bad omen for the 
   marriage. It brings misfortune, it brings death. Soon, everyone in 
   the church is looking at the candle, waiting for it to extinguish. We 
   then see Puri kneeling on the ground, crying while she says, 
   &quot;Blood of Christ. Demon. A curse on him. A curse that he will 
   never forget me. A curse until the grave.&quot; Just then, we see the 
   candle get brighter, the flame rising higher, as a sigh of relief can 
   be heard from everyone inside the church, including the bride and 
   groom. Puri steals a young shepherd's staff and uses it to make the 
   sheep try to interfere with the wedding, but fails. Puri then bangs 
   on the church's door, calling out Antonio's name over and over, but 
   some townspeople apprehend and carry her away.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see the bride's mother&nbsp; and some other people preparing 
   the wedding bed (An old Italian religious custom), sliding a scythe 
   under the bed while chanting, &quot;With this scythe under the bed, 
   you will protect them from demons.&quot; They then sprinkle grapes on 
   the bed while chanting, &quot;Here are the grapes that have soaked up 
   all the evil that there is in this room. Here are the grapes purged 
   of all their juices that we arrange in the form of a cross. Dry 
   sweet, sweet grapes (Why don't they just call them raisins? I always 
   thought they were the Devil's food!). You shall be the bait for bad 
   thoughts. If they want to enter here, you will poison them.&quot; The 
   mother then puts salt under one of the pillows and says it's 
   time&nbsp; for the children to enter. Antonio and his bride (whom 
   remains nameless throughout the film) enter the bedroom and get the 
   mother's permission to do the dirty (I'm surprised the mother and 
   other people don't remain in the bedroon to watch them having sex!). 
   We see Puri hiding outside, holding a dead cat (!), while the mother 
   of the bride posts two men to stand guard outside the house, telling 
   them not to move. We hear Puri chant, &quot;As this is born (the dead 
   cat), so, too, will be born the first son.&quot; She then repeats the 
   chant over and over, each time with more force in her voice. Puri 
   walks up to the two (sleeping) guards and throws the dead cat at 
   them. They chase her, but Puri loses them in a flock of sheep. The 
   elderly shepherd tells Puri he knows her, starts ripping her clothes 
   and hog-ties her. He then rips off all her clothes and rapes her (offscreen).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next morning, we see Puri sitting on the bank of a river, while 
   a boy tries to have a conversation with her, but she ignores him. She 
   then looks at the boy, smiles and says his name is Salvatore. She 
   says she knows he has been very ill, but he has already cured 
   himself. Salvatore says yes, he has cured himself and is well. When 
   Puri asks him what he is doing, Salvatore says he is watching the 
   water, asking Puri if she likes the water. Puri tells him, &quot;I 
   crossed to the east and came here in order to see the torrent&quot; 
   and Salvatore says he crossed the same way. Puri and Salvatore become 
   quick friends, but Puri says she must go home now. You may not 
   realize this, but this short conversation holds a deep meaning to the 
   film's core story. If I reveal to you what it is, I would be 
   destroying one of the many surprises this film holds. Okay, I'm going 
   to ruin it for you, so here is your only <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">SPOILER
    WARNING!!!</FONT></B>: Salvatore was a ghost, a spirit, for when 
   Puri arrives home, her mother tells her that Salvatore just died of 
   his illness. Puri runs to Salvatore's home and sees his dead body 
   laid out, while all the women in attendence cry. When Puri tells 
   Salvatore's mother that she was just talking to her son down by the 
   river, all the women call her a witch and begin to attack her, only 
   to be stopped by priest Father Tomaso (Giovanni Cristofanelli), who 
   tells the women that Puri is one of God's children. At Salvatore's 
   funeral, where everyone attending confesses their sins out loud 
   (another old religious Italian custom), Puri yells out, &quot;I have 
   spoken with a demon! Virgin Mary, forgive me! I am damned! 
   Damned!&quot; The Virgin Mary may forgive her, but she will get no 
   forgiveness from the townspeople, who look at her like she is the 
   Devil himself. <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">END OF SPOILER!!!</FONT></B> 
   The rest of the film is about Puri's journey into forgiving herself, 
   but it won't be easy, because a series of incidents paint Puri as a 
   real witch. You'll have to watch the film to discover Puri's hellish 
   journey and decide for yourself if she is actually damned or 
   suffering from a mental illness. You see, damnation does not only 
   come from God, it can come from within. Separating that line is not 
   as easy as you would think.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I wonder if director William Friedkin saw this film before making <B><A HREF="exorcist.htm">THE
    EXORCIST</A></B> (1973). There are too many scenes in this film that 
   are used nearly verbatim in Friedkin's film, including the 
   spider-walk sequence (Puri spider-walks inside a church while Father 
   Tommaso tries to exorcize the demon[s] he believes are possessing 
   her.). While the spider-walk sequence was edited out of Friedkin's 
   film, it was restored in the Special Edition of the film released 
   twenty-five years later. But that's neither here or there, as this 
   film is totally original and as bleak as they come. It is also full 
   of religious symbolism, such as the scene where Puri is sitting in a 
   tree eating an apple, as the townspeople curse the dark clouds that 
   are hanging over their town, thinking it is the Devil's work, while 
   chanting, &quot;Begone! Go! Ugly cloud! Away with you, cloud!&quot;, 
   even though the town is desperately in need of rain for their 
   starving crops. While not necessarily a horror film, this film plays 
   more like a psychological thriller with supernatuaral overtones, 
   where religion is used as a crutch, ruining many lives in this small 
   village by trusting that God will do right by them. Others in the 
   village use religion for their own personal gain, be it monetary or 
   sexually, which Puri soon discovers (An &quot;Exorcist&quot; examines 
   Puri's body to see if she is really possessed, but all he is doing is 
   copping a few cheap feels and he also eventually rapes her). Since 
   this was made in 1963, director Brunello Rondi (<B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#ViolentLife1962">A
    VIOLENT LIFE</A></B> - 1962; <B><A HREF="riot_in_a_womens_prison_1974.htm">RIOT

   sexually explicit material, but the screenplay, which he co-wrote 
   with Ugo Guerra (<B><A HREF="bullet_for_sandoval_1969.htm">A BULLET 
   FOR SANDOVAL</A></B> - 1969) and Luciano Martino (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#MurderClinic1966">THE
    MURDER CLINIC</A></B> - 1966), is able to get the point across, not 
   by showing skin (although there are several scenes that do show it, 
   but not in any titillating way), but from the expressions on Puri's 
   face, in which Daliah Lavi turns in a performance so emotional and 
   finely-tuned, you'll be wondering why she acted in so <A HREF="demon_1963.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/demon 1963 italy poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="220" HEIGHT="308" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>few
    films, as her performance is outstanding and, above all, believable 
   (Ms. Lavi passed away in 2017 at the age of 74). Frank Wolff, who is 
   equally excellent as Antonio, was a tragic figure in real life. He 
   suffered from a lifetime of depression, killing himself in a hotel 
   room in December of 1971 at the age of 43. Wolff, who got his start 
   appearing in several Roger Corman films (such as <B><A HREF="wasp_woman_1959.htm">THE
    WASP WOMAN</A></B> and <B><A HREF="beast_from_haunted_cave_1959.htm">BEAST

    WALKS ON HIGH HEELS</A></B> - 1971) before his depression got the 
   better of him. I believe one of the main reasons this film works so 
   well is because many of the background actors are not actors at all; 
   they are just &quot;regular&quot; people, this being their only film 
   and giving this village a population of real people (i.e. dentally 
   challenged, wrinkled and just plain ugly). The black &amp; white 
   cinematography, by Carlo Bellero (<B><A HREF="women_of_devils_island_1962.htm">WOMEN
    OF DEVIL'S ISLAND</A></B> - 1962), also adds to the film's 
   effectiveness, as many of the compositions are truly amazing (it must 
   be viewed in widescreen to be fully appreciated). This is a film 
   quite unlike any genre film to come out of Italy in the early-'60s. 
   As a matter of fact, I can't think of a genre to which this film 
   could be applied to totally, making it a unique and rewarding 
   experience for viewers looking for something different from 
   everything else. If you are one of these people, this is the film for 
   you. It is my favorite film to come out of Italy (or anywhere else) 
   during the 1960s. This was the first screen credit for one of my 
   favorite Italian directors of all time, Sergio Martino (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Torso1973">TORSO</A></B>

    <FONT COLOR="MAROON">Nostradamus</FONT></B> I don't know why it has 
   taken me so long to review this film; a guilty pleasure of mine ever 
   since I saw it in a theater during the mid-'80s. I watch it at least 
   a couple of times every twelve months, first on VHS, then on DVD and, 
   finally, on Blu-Ray over the years. Sure, the film makes very little 
   sense, but it has an atmosphere that just won't quit and the gore, by 
   Sergio Stivaletti (<B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Specters1987">SPECTERS</A></B>

   plentiful, as the blood and green puss flow freely throughout the 
   film. This may be my favorite film of director Lamberto Bava's 
   career, helped by the fact that Dario Argento was the producer and 
   co-writer of the screenplay, along with Bava and Dardano Sacchetti (<B><A HREF="beyond_1981.htm">THE
    BEYOND</A></B> - 1981; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NewYorkRipper1982">THE

   It definitely has the patented Argento &quot;touch&quot; and is full 
   of gel lighting, weird set pieces and violence that borders on the 
   insane (including bladder effects that explode the nasty green puss). 
   The film also moves super-fast and after the first fifteen minutes, 
   where we are introduced to the many characters who are future fodder 
   for the demons, the film doesn't let up and the 89-minute running 
   time seems like only thirty minutes has passed. This was also one of 
   the last Italian horror films to get a theatrical release in the 
   United States in the '80s, where it was released Unrated (and 
   rightfully so). So let's get to the film at hand.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We watch as the lovely college student Cheryl (Natasha Hovey) steps 
   off a subway car in West Berlin and is followed by a man dressed in 
   black, who is wearing a weird silver mask (played by future director

   to her and hands her a complimentary gold ticket to a sneak preview 
   film tonight at the new Metropol Theatre, who begins handing out 
   tickets to other people in the subway station. Cheryl then asks the 
   man for another ticket for her friend Kathy (Paola Cazzo; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CatInTheBrain">A
    CAT IN THE BRAIN</A></B> - 1990) and he hands her one. Cheryl meets 
   Kathy outside the subway station and they decide to ditch night 
   classes in order to see the unknown film at the Metropol (Kathy hopes 
   it's not a horror film. Boy, is she going to be disappointed!). They 
   find the creepy theatre and go inside, where we watch Ingrid, the 
   mysterious usherette (played by a grown Nicoletta Elmi, who, as a 
   young child, appeared in such films as <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BayOfBlood1971">A

   strangely decorated lobby of the theatre has a mannequin dressed in <B><A HREF="road_warrior_1982.htm">ROAD
    WARRIOR</A></B>-like gear sitting on a motorcycle holding a real 
   Samurai sword. Also on the motorcycle handlebar is a strange silver 
   demon mask, which Rosemary puts on to scare Tony and Carmen, but it 
   cuts her cheek when she puts it on. Everyone then enters the theatre, 
   as the movie is about to begin.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Everyone in the theatre begins watching the movie, where two couples 
   on motorcycles enter an eerie cemetery looking for the tomb of 
   Nostradamus. They find the tomb, but it is empty, except for a book 
   written in Latin and a mask very similar to the one Rosemary put on. 
   When one of the guys puts on the mask, it, too, cuts him on the cheek 
   and at the same time, the scratch on Rosemary's cheek begins to bleed 
   profusely, so she excuses herself and goes to the bathroom to take 
   care of it, not seeing the guy in the film turning into a 
   bloodthirsty demon and a single scratch from him turns anyone who 
   gets one into a demon. In a case of a film mirroring real life, 
   Rosemary looks in the bathroom mirror and watches as the cut on her 
   cheek turn into a huge boil, which bursts (a bladder effect still 
   hard for me to watch up to this day), spraying green bile all over 
   Rosemary and the bathroom sink. When Tony starts wondering where 
   Rosemary is, Carmen leaves to go check on her, finding Rosemary in 
   one of the bathroom stalls, now a full-fledged demon. She attacks 
   Carmen, slowly turning her into a demon. In the film's standout 
   sequence, a morphing Carmen stands behind the theatre's screen, as a 
   demon on-screen attacks a woman named Edith (Eliana Miglio; Bava's <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#YoullDieMidnight86">YOU'LL
    DIE AT MIDNIGHT</A> </B>- 1986) in a tent, tearing at the material 
   with a large knife, both Edith and Carmen screaming, but the audience 
   can only hear Edith's cries for help. As the demon makes one last cut 
   in the tent, Carmen comes bursting out of the screen and falls to the 
   theatre's stage floor (an impressive scene). Everyone comes running 
   to the stage, where they watch as Carmen's teeth and fingernails fall 
   out and are replaced by sharp fangs and claws. Meanwhile, Demon 
   Rosemary attacks Liz and her lover (Claudio Spadaro; <B><A HREF="belly_of_an_architect_1987.htm">THE
    BELLY OF AN ARCHITECT</A></B> - 1987; Liz only came to the theater 
   so she could make out with her lover, which she does in the seat next 
   to her blind father!), hanging the lover from the balcony using the 
   theatre's red velvet ropes.&nbsp;Father Werner has his eyes poked out 
   by Demon Rosemary's claws (a little overkill, if you ask me, since he 
   was already blind, but that's demons for you!). When Demon Carmen 
   attacks Frank, everyone runs for their lives, but soon discover that 
   the theatre is locked tight and there is no way to escape; the doors 
   are actually hiding solid walls behind them like some supernatural 
   force made the door openings disappear.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    After trapping Demon Rosemary in a room where there is no escape (by 
   dragging a soda machine to the door, trapping her/it inside), George 
   &amp; Cheryl and Kathy &amp; Ken try to find a way out of this deadly 
   mess, when someone mentions that the film (which is still playing) 
   may be the cause of the demons and if they stop the film, all this 
   may end, so Tony and nearly everyone else go to the projection booth 
   upstairs, but the door is <A HREF="demons_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("204","303") --><IMG SRC="images/demons 1985 spain poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>locked.

   projectors, they discover that their nightmare has just begun, as all 
   the people attacked are now turning into demoms with sharp claws and 
   glowing eyes (A sequence showing the demons running through a foggy 
   hallway in slow-motion, their eyes glowing as we hear their growls, 
   is one of the film's best-remembered [and rightfully so] scenes). Now 
   convinced that it is the theatre causing all this, our unhappy 
   heroes, along with their new girlfriends, try to find a way out of 
   the theatre, but when they have no luck, they, and the majority of 
   the unaffected audience, go to the balcony, and block the entrances 
   by ripping out all the seats and stacking them next to the doors, 
   thinking they will be safe until someone comes to rescue them. That 
   &quot;someone&quot; may be punker Ripper (Lino Salemme; Bava's <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#DeliriumGioia1987">DELIRIUM:
    PHOTO OF GIOIA</A></B> - 1987) and his three punk rocker friends, 
   who are in a stolen car and snorting cocaine from a Coca-Cola can 
   through a drinking straw (The Coke can was optically removed from 
   U.S. theatrical prints, but restored back into the DVD and Blu-ray 
   releases). When back seat passengers fight over the cocaine and spill 
   it out of the can, Ripper stops the car and makes them pick up all 
   the coke using razor blades (a scene deleted from U.S. theatrical 
   prints shows Hot Dog [Giuseppe Cruciano; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#MonsterFlorence1985">THE
    MONSTER OF FLORENCE</A></B> - 1985] removing spilled cocaine from 
   Nina's [Bettina Ciampolini] breast with a razor blade and cutting her 
   in the process. It was also restored on the disc releases). While the 
   car is stopped, two policemen approach it and the four punkers try to 
   escape, ending up in an alley next to the Metropol Theatre. When it 
   looks like they are trapped, a door opens and allows them to enter 
   the theatre. When the police arrive, they discover someone hiding 
   behind a car in the alley. thinking it is one of the Punks, they 
   approach with guns drawn and are attacked by Demon Werner, their 
   fates as yet unknown. Unable to find a way to escape the theater, the 
   punkers unblock the door that was trapping the Demon Rosemary inside 
   and when they see there's no exit in there, they all walk away, 
   except for Nina that is, who decides to look at herself in a full-length
    mirror while slime travels down it. She is then attacked by Demon 
   Rosemary and turned into a demon herself.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Tommy and Hannah try to escape through an air conditioner vent, but 
   Hannah, who was scratched earlier, turns into a demon and kills 
   Tommy. When the people in the balcony hear the punkers downstairs, 
   they mistakenly think they are their rescuers and beging clearing the 
   torn seats from the entrances, much to George's chagrin, who tries to 
   reason with the mob, but fails. Of course, a swarm of demons attack 
   everyone and they are killed, except for Cheryl, Kathy, George and 
   Ken, who escape. They, too, decide to escape through the air 
   conditioning vents, but when Kathy starts turning into a demon (she 
   swallowed some demon blood during the escape) and a baby demon bursts 
   out of her back (!) and scratches Ken across his chest. Ken begs 
   George to kill him before he turns into a demon, so he grabs the 
   samurai sword from the lobby and slices Ken to death (but not until 
   Ken turns into a demon! Some friend, right?). When Cheryl is trapped 
   in the theatre, George hops on the motorcycle in the lobby (which 
   seems to be full of gas!), rides it into the theatre while swinging 
   the sword, killing all the demons inside and saving Cheryl (Yes, it's 
   as ridiculous as it sounds, with George riding the motorcycle over 
   the theatre seats, but it works within the premise of the film). Then 
   something really strange and ridiculous happens.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A helicopter crashes through the roof and lands in the middle of the 
   theatre! With more demons approaching them, George uses an 
   air-powered bazooka-like weapon to propel a grappling hook attached 
   to the helicopter's winch, allowing him and Cheryl to escape to the 
   theatre's roof. George is attacked by the masked ticket man on the 
   roof, but George manages to impale the ticket man's eye and head on 
   some rebar sticking out of the hole in the roof, killing him. They 
   then descend the roof using some rope, but are followed by the Demon 
   Rosemary, whom George throws off the rope to the hard pavement 
   below.&nbsp; Now free of the theatre, they discover that the entire 
   town has been infected with demons (thanks to Demon Werner and the 
   two policemen he turned). George and Cheryl are saved by a family in 
   a Jeep (The Jeep driver is portrayed by Goffredo Unger; Bava's <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Devil Fish">DEVIL
    FISH</A></B> - 1984) and, as they pull away , the final credits 
   roll, but there's a surprise to be had mid-credits. I'll leave that 
   for you to discover on your own. Needless to say, if you deal with 
   demons, there will be Hell to pay.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    If you put your mind in neutral and just go along with the film, 
   there are many pleasures to be had here, especially Goblin member 
   Claudio Simonetti's <A HREF="demons_1985.htm#OST">pulsating 
   electronic music score</A> (the opening song, &quot;Demon&quot;, is a 
   killer track), one of the best scores of Italian genre films of the 
   '80s (I love it so much that I downloaded an MP3 version of the score 
   from Amazon, something I usually never do). Also containing songs 
   from such '80s artists as Billy Idol (&quot;White Wedding&quot; plays 
   during the whole cocaine-sniffing/spilling scene); Go West (&quot;We 
   Close Our Eyes&quot;); Motley Crue (&quot;Save our Souls&quot;); Rick 
   Springfield (&quot;Walking On The Edge'); Saxon (&quot;Everybody 
   Up&quot;); and a few more bands I never heard of, also enhance the 
   film's atmosphere (Just the song titles alone will make you chuckle 
   slightly when they play, as they fit what is happening on screen). 
   This is probably Lamberto Bava's most enjoyable film, which is thanks 
   to the participation of Dario Argento, who adds an edge missing from 
   most of Bava's films (besides the ones already mentioned in this 
   review, there are <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Macabre1980">MACABRE</A></B>

   regular Gianlorenzo Battaglia (he also shot <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Miami Horror">MIAMI
    HORROR</A></B> - 1985 and <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Witchery">WITCHERY</A></B> 
   - 1988), is also better than most Italian horror films, thanks to a 
   budget of approx. $1,800,000 due mostly to Argento's involvement, 
   which is a lot more than the usual budgets of Italian genre films 
   from the same period. Using a real helicopter (probably something 
   found in an airport graveyard) to crash through the<A HREF="demons_1985.htm"><IMG SRC="images/demons 1985 italy poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="209" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   theatre's roof was a brilliant idea (if you don't think too hard) and 
   watching it fall without the use of CGI or miniatures only adds to 
   the viewer's enjoyment. You don't see that in many horror films, at 
   least done practically without any computer or digital help. It adds 
   a sense of realism to the film, if you don't think too hard 
   (something I'm really good at). If you have never seen this film, I 
   would advise you jump on it immediately. It's one of the best Italian 
   horror films of the '80s, thanks to great makeup effects, a great 
   music score and a plot that whizzes by very quickly. A sequel 
   followed the next year, <B><A HREF="demons_2_1986.htm">DEMONS 2</A></B> 
   (1986), and I won't be reviewing it because it is bascially a 
   reworking of this film, substituting an ultra-modern apartment 
   building for a theatre and TV sets for a theatre screen, but it's 
   just as entertaining as this film (Some find it the better film, but 
   I wouldn't go that far. It is, in my opinion, an equally enjoyable 
   flick for fans of the first film and features some of the same cast, 
   but in different roles). I'll leave it for a better person to <A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#Demons2-1986">review</A>.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   worry, I will explain everything at the end of the review, but let's 
   get to the film proper.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The film begins with the body of a young woman being discovered 
   floating in the Seine River on the outskirts of Paris, France. The 
   coroner tells his assistants that her body has been totally drained 
   of blood, yet there are no injuries on her body, just like the three 
   other young women found murdered in Paris in as many weeks. Newspaper 
   reporter Pierre Lantin (Dario Michaelis; <B><A HREF="harry novak.htm#Mad Butcher">THE
    MAD BUTCHER</A></B> - 1972) is working on the story and has dubbed 
   the killer &quot;The Vampire&quot;, which gets on the nerves of 
   Police Inspector Chantal (Carlo D'Angelo; <B><A HREF="great_silence_1968.htm">THE
    GREAT SILENCE</A></B> - 1968). Pierre knows that discovering the 
   identity of the killer will be the greatest scoop of his career, so 
   he is not beyond taking some barely legal shortcuts to achieve his 
   goal, which is why the Inspector has such a low opinion of him.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see someone wearing black gloves opening a drawer and 
   looking at the file of twenty-year-old Nora Duval. We then see Nora 
   (Ronny Holiday), who is a dancer at a musical theater, telling her 
   three female friends (also dancers) that she can't go out with them 
   tonight; she has to wait at the theater for a phone call from her 
   boyfriend. Nora is a nervous wreck, not helped by reading Pierre's 
   latest newspaper story on the Vampire. The gloved man then enters the 
   theater, walks up the stairs and enters the room Nora is in. He puts 
   a chloroform-soaked rag over her nose and mouth and drags her 
   unconscious body away (We also get a very good look at the man who is 
   doing this in the mirror, the unmistakable visage of actor Paul Muller;<B> <A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LadyFrankenstein">LADY
    FRANKENSTEIN</A></B> - 1971). When Nora never makes it home, the 
   Inspector is called in and talks to the theater's concierge, who says 
   that he went out for a bite to eat and when he came back to the 
   theater, Nora was no longer there. The Inspector says that maybe Nora 
   went out with her boyfriend, but Pierre shows up and tells the 
   Inspector that Nora did not leave the theater willingly, showing him 
   a copy of his latest newspaper story, whose headline reads, 
   &quot;Vampire Kidnaps Dancer From Theater.&quot; The Inspector tells 
   Pierre he is getting ahead of the story, but Pierre says he can prove 
   it, showing him a shoe that the concierge identifies as Nora's (If I 
   were the Inspector, I would have arrested Pierre for tampering with 
   evidence!). Pierre give the Inspector the shoe, telling him he found 
   it in the theater's wings and then leaves, saying he has got other 
   places to snoop around in (Pierre is so callous to the Inspector, no 
   one would blame him for putting a bullet between his eyes!). The 
   forensics doctor (a cameo by Freda) tells the Inspector that he has 
   one good clue: all four victims had the same blood type and they all 
   had traces of needle marks on their bodies with no signs of struggle. 
   Now this is where there is some adult talk (missing from the U.S. 
   version). The doctor tells the Inspector that not only doctors know 
   how to use hypodermic needles, just think how skilled drug addicts 
   and people who need to give themselves an injection every day are 
   (like diabetics).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Pierre is talking to his photographer, Ronald (Angelo Galassi), when 
   he notices some of the photos he took at one of the Vampire's crime 
   scenes contain a man in the background who looks to be purposely 
   hiding his face (we can see it is Nora's abductor). Pierre decides to 
   talk to the latest dead girl's female school friends as they walk out 
   of school, in hopes of coming up with a clue. Lorette (Wandisa Guida; <B><A HREF="#Scorpion2Tails1982">THE
    SCORPION WITH TWO TAILS</A></B> - 1982) tells Pierre that a man was 
   following her the day her friend was murdered, describing him as tall 
   and thin and wearing a topcoat. When Pierre shows her the photo 
   Ronald took, Lorette says that is him. Pierre asks Lorette that if 
   she saw him again, could she identify him and she says yes, she'll 
   never forget the &quot;dazed look&quot; on his face. As Pierre is 
   talking to the girls, a jealous Giselle du Grand (Gianna Maria 
   Canale; <B><A HREF="hercules_1958.htm">HERCULES</A></B> - 1958) pulls 
   up in her car and calls for Pierre, telling him she feels as if he is 
   neglecting her and he half-heartedly apologizes, saying the Vampire 
   murders are keeping him busy (It is apparent by the look on Ronald's 
   face, as he watches by a newspaper stand, that he has more than a 
   passing fancy for Giselle, but she hardly notices him). Giselle 
   accuses Pierre of being more interested in the schoolgirls than her 
   and not-so-politely blackmails him to visit her in her castle 
   tonight, otherwise she will call his boss and demand Pierre do a 
   story on the castle. Pierre agrees to see her tonight because he 
   knows that the du Grand family has a lot of political pull in Paris, 
   but he is not happy about it. Ronald tells Pierre that the most 
   beautiful woman in Paris just made eyes at him and he acts like he 
   doesn't care, but Pierre tells Ronald it is a long story between 
   their families and to leave it at that.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The man that kidnapped Nora is going through withdrawal on a bed, 
   begging an unseen man for a fix, but the unseen man tells him if he 
   wants his fix, he has to kidnap another young girl, showing him a 
   photo of Lorette. He gives him the address where Lorette will be 
   tonight and how to get into the building without being seen, giving 
   him just a small injection of the drug and promising him a full fix 
   when he kidnaps Lorette (This entire sequence is missing from the 
   American edit). Pierre sees the man walking by Lorette's school and 
   follows him to an apartment. He knocks on the door and the man 
   answers, quickly closing the door when Pierre asks if a fictional man 
   is there. Pierre takes a Polaroid of the apartment door, showing the 
   apartment's number and then goes to the Inspector to tell him 
   everything he knows. He brings the Inspector to the apartment 
   building, but when they knock on the apartment door, a one-armed man 
   answers, telling him he has been in this apartment all day and had no 
   visitors. He tells the Inspector that he's a former police officer 
   who lost his arm in the line of duty and has no idea what Pierre is 
   talking about (even the window, which Pierre saw when the jonesing 
   man answered the door, is now all bricked up!). How could all this 
   have been done in a span of twenty minutes? Is Pierre losing his 
   mind? The Inspector sure thinks so, calling Pierre a 
   &quot;meddler&quot; and accusing him of looking for publicity at any cost.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The tall, lanky drug addict then goes to the office of Professor 
   Julien du Grand (Antoine Balpetre; <B><A HREF="hands_of_orlac_1960.htm">THE
    HANDS OF ORLAC</A></B> - 1960), where we discover the addict's name 
   is Joseph Signoret. He tells the Professor and his nameless 
   club-footed assistant (Renato Tontini) that he has to leave town and 
   he wants some money, a lot of money, otherwise he will tell the 
   police everything. The Professor tells Joseph he has no idea what he 
   is talking about, as the assistant sneaks up behind Joseph and 
   strangles him with a piece of rubber hose. The elderly Margherita du 
   Grand then enters the Professor's office and chides him for what has 
   happened, telling him there is only one way he can save face and 
   restore the good name of du Grand. The next day, newspaper headlines 
   read &quot;Professor Julien du Grand Dies Unexpectedly.&quot; 
   Everyone important in Paris, except for Giselle, attends the 
   Professor's funeral, held at the Du Grand Castle cemetery family 
   mausoleum. One old man says to another that the Duchess Giselle never 
   attends funerals, she never has. Ronald wonders why the elderly 
   Margherita du Grand always covers her face with a black veil and 
   Pierre tells him that no one has seen her face for a long, long time. 
   Pierre goes on to say that Margherita was once a very beautiful woman 
   who could never adjust to growing old. Margherita was in love with 
   Pierre's father, but he hated her and wanted nothing to do with her. 
   She was a heartless woman who destroyed Pierre's mother's life (It 
   helps explain why Pierre wants nothing to do with Giselle, but if he 
   knew the whole story, no one would blame him if he put a bullet 
   between Giselle's eyes!). Think you know the secret? If you don't 
   want to know, I would advise you skip the next three paragraphs.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">Warning: SPOILERS!!!</FONT></B> It turns out 
   that the body buried in the Professor's tomb is not the Professor at 
   all, but Joseph. Joseph's corpse is stolen from the tomb and brought 
   to the secret castle laboratory run by a still-alive Professor du 
   Grand, who is working on a way to extend human life eternally. 
   Lorette meets a blind man on the street (who isn't really blind), who 
   asks her to personally deliver a letter for him. When she delivers 
   the letter, she is kidnapped and awakens in a room full of skeletons, 
   apparent victims of the Vampire. Pierre's boss (who doesn't care too 
   much for Pierre) takes him off the Vampire story and re-assigns him 
   to cover a fancy ball at the Castle du Grand. Pierre is livid at 
   Giselle, because he knows it was her that got him re-assigned (just 
   like she promised). Pierre leaves the ball early, telling Ronald that 
   he couldn't possibly love a womanlike Giselle, mainly for what her 
   family did to his. Ronald sees this as his opportunity to profess his 
   love to Giselle and tells Pierre he is staying, not knowing that he 
   is about to discover a secret he will not get the chance to tell 
   anyone else.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Ronald goes back to the ball and gets Giselle alone, where he 
   professes his love for her. Giselle callously turns him down, saying 
   neither she nor her family could possible accept a 
   &quot;commoner&quot; like him into their family and, frankly, she has 
   no interest in him whatsoever. As she is saying this, Ronald sees 
   Giselle turn old before his very eyes, revealing Giselle and 
   Margherita are the same person! She tells Ronald that each young girl 
   that was killed restored her youthful beauty for a short time, but 
   the times are getting shorter and shorter. Then she reaches for a 
   pistol and shoots Ronald, killing him. Giselle then tells the 
   Professor that he better perfect his serum so she can stay eternally 
   young without growing old again. The Professor tells Giselle that the 
   injections are playing havoc with her psyche and he thinks giving her 
   another shot will make her lose her mind totally, but she doesn't 
   care, she can't stand being old. The Professor takes some of 
   Lorette's youthful beauty and injects it into Giselle.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Pierre begins to notice Giselle acting stranger than normal. A 
   chance meeting on the street takes Giselle and Pierre to an antiques 
   store where Pierre notices Giselle signing a check for a painting 
   with the wrong hand (She is right-handed, but signs her name with her 
   left hand). Things turn really bad when a revived Joseph wakes up in 
   the Professor's lab and escapes. Pierre brings Joseph to the police 
   station, where he confesses to kidnapping the young women, but tells 
   the Inspector he didn't kill them, the Professor and his assistant 
   did. Pierre, the Inspector and his men search the castle and find 
   nothing, but as they are about to leave, a totally wigged-out Giselle 
   (who is taunting Pierre and the Inspector for finding nothing) begins 
   to turn old before their very eyes, transforming into Margherita. Not 
   believing his own eyes, the Inspector tells his men to make a more 
   thorough search of the castle, where they find the Professor's hidden 
   laboratory, resulting in a gun battle, where the Professor and his 
   assistant are shot dead. They open the Professor's tomb and find 
   Lorette inside, still alive, and send her home with her father. And 
   what about Giselle? The Inspector tells Pierre a few days later 
   (wrapping-up the film) that he arrested Giselle and put her in a jail 
   cell, where she died of old age a short time later. <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">END

    If it seems that this film's finale seems rushed, it is because 
   director Riccardo Freda went into one of his patented snits and 
   stormed off set (just like he did on <B><A HREF="caltiki_the_immortal_monster_1959.htm">CALTIKI</A></B>),
    never to return, with the film only half finished, leaving 
   cinematographer Mario Bava to rewrite the script (screenplay by 
   Freda, Piero Regnoli [director of <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Playgirls&amp;Vampire60">THE
    PLAYGIRLS AND THE VAMPIRE</A></B> - 1960; and screenwriter of <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#ThirdEye1966">THE
    THIRD EYE</A></B> - 1966 and many more horror films] and Rijk 
   Sijostrom [his only film credit]) and complete the film in two days 
   (this film only had a twelve day shooting schedule). A lot of people 
   credit this film for jump-starting the Italian horror film industry, 
   since Benito Mussolini banned horror films in the '20s through the 
   '40s for stupid reasons relating to the beginning of World War II 
   (and being scared to death when watching Karloff's <B><A HREF="frankenstein_1932.htm">FRANKENSTEIN</A></B> 
   [1932] in a theater!) and this was the first talking Italian horror 
   film (which is reason enough to give it a place in history), but the 
   fact is this film tanked at the Italian boxoffice and lost money. It 
   wouldn't be until Bava released <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackSunday1960">BLACK
    SUNDAY</A></B> in 1960 that Italian horror films caught fire (and 
   rightfully so). That's not to say this film doesn't contain some good 
   stuff, because it does. Bava's black and white cinematography is 
   beyond reproach, evoking an eerie atmospheric vibe in every 
   fog-shrouded location (even though it was set in Paris, the entire 
   film was shot on stages in Rome, Italy). This film was also shot in 
   CinemaScope, a rarity for an Italian genre film and Bava takes full 
   advantage of the extremely wide frame. The film looks rather 
   expensive, even though it was a low-budget affair shot in two weeks. 
   Like I said in the beginning of this review, this film's plot is very 
   adult in terms of drugs and addiction. Turns out it was a little too 
   adult for American audiences because when it was released here in 
   1963 (under the review title), a full six years after it was made, 
   all scenes depicting drug use and addiction were excised from the 
   film and replaced with newly-shot footage, some of it featuring Al 
   Lewis, &quot;Grandpa&quot; on TV's <B><A HREF="munster_movies.htm">THE
    MUNSTERS</A></B> (1964 - 1966). Most of the original sequences were 
   drastically shortened and it contained a new opening credits 
   sequence, as well as a new five minute sequence of a young<A HREF="devils_commandment_1957.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/devil's commandment italy poster small2a.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   woman being killed in a restaurant, yet the original film's 85-minute 
   running time was shortened to 70 minutes. This review is based on the 
   uncut Italian version, which doesn't cater to prudes or those easily 
   offended. Those that are should watch the American edit instead, 
   which, surprisingly, contains new footage that treads closely to 
   female nudity in the opening credits sequence. I guess near-nudity 
   was more acceptable than drug use. This film is actually a modern 
   take on the Elizabeth Bathory legend, which was covered in such films 
   as <B><A HREF="countess_dracula_1971.htm">COUNTESS DRACULA</A></B> 
   (1971), <B><A HREF="daughters_of_darkness_1971.htm">DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS</A></B> 
   (1971) and <B><A HREF="legend_of_blood_castle_1972.htm">THE LEGEND OF 
   BLOOD CASTLE</A></B> (1972), but instead of bathing in the blood of 
   virgins to keep her youth, she just steals their youth with a simple 
   injection (the film fails to mention if the murdered girls were 
   virgins, but their friends certainly were!). There are a couple of 
   horrifying transformation scenes in this film, done with an eye for 
   shocking the audience and it succeeds. The transformation scenes 
   would still work in films today, because they are that good. This may 
   be the first Italian-made horror film in the Sound Era, but it 
   delivers in spades with shocks and scares.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   everyone to leave the building and go to safety, he will take care of 
   the baby. He christens the baby girl &quot;Camilla Von Rhoneberg&quot;

   and we then see the Baron in modern day (at least in 1971), talking 
   to a female psychiatrist (Yvonne Garden), who wants to take photos of 
   the Baron's castle, which he flat-out prohibits her from doing. She 
   goes to the castle anyway, snapping away with her camera. She will

    A busload of tourists are traveling down a road when their path is

   Maillet), asks a strange-looking pale man (Daniel Emilfork; <B><A HREF="city_of_lost_children_1995.htm">THE

   controlled fire with a pitchfork, how long it will take them to get

   take a ferry, but it doesn't leave until tomorrow. He tells them to 
   go to the Baron's castle and he'll give them room and board for the 
   night. We then see some people carrying the psychiatrist's dead body 
   into town, where a doctor says she probably died of a heart attack. 
   The doctor says, by the look on her face, she died from fear and his 
   assistant points to a strange wound on her arm. An old woman says,

   of a stone gargoyle that falls from the castle. The front door of the

    OF THE BLACK CAT</A></B> - 1972) is frightened by a frog that 
   crosses her path. The Baron's butler, Hans (Maurice Degroot), 
   welcomes the group and tells them he was expecting them, as a woman 
   called and said they were coming, even telling him their names. Hans 
   shows Father Alvin Sorel (Jacques Monseu), a theology student who is 
   not yet a priest, to his room, telling him to be careful where he 
   places his suitcase, because this room has the mark of the Devil (the 
   same symbol that was on the psychiatrist's arm) on the floor next to 
   the fireplace. Hans gives him a history of his room. The mark dates 
   back to December 8, 1575, the date Erika Von Rhoneberg plunged a 
   knife into a monk's heart, who was performing an exorcism her. Erika 
   then disappeared, leaving this mark of the Devil.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   to their room and they find an unconscious pigeon on the floor. Hans 
   then tells them the history of their room. In 1436, Prince and 
   Princess Hart had their throats cut when they were sleeping (He sure 
   has a way of making guests feel comfortable!). Hans then shows Max to 
   his room (while stroking the pigeon!) and then shows the elderly Mr. 
   Mason (Lucien Raimbourg) to his room, where he complains that the 
   room is stuffy. Hans says there is nothing he can do about it since 
   the window is sealed shut and then continues to tell him why. The 
   window has been sealed since 1738, when Lily Von Rhoneberg fell to 
   her death from that window. Hans then shows Corinne and Regine to 
   their room (Regine is too scared to sleep alone and I can't blame 
   her, but we find out there is another reason!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see the Baron in a laboratory in the castle basement, where 
   is is performing some unknown (for now) experiment. We then see Max 
   pull sausage and salami from his suitcase (He is always stuffing his 
   face with something), while Corinne and Regine have a lesbian 
   encounter. Nancy accuses Howard of cheating on her, going as far to 
   say that he only married her for her money (Howard makes a 
   half-hearted remark denying it). The Baron introduces himself to the 
   group over dinner, where he gives his guests a history of the Von 
   Rhoneberg family line. <B>&quot;In the 12th century, my ancestor, 
   Sigfried Von Rhoneberg, is said to have signed a pact with the Devil. 
   In exchange for his services, Satan demanded that the eldest daughter 
   of each generation of my family will will be in his service, where 
   she'll become a succubus.&quot;</B> Father Alvin explains to everyone 
   what a succubus is: Demons that adopt a feminine appearance in order 
   to seduce man and lead him to perdition. Howard and Mr. Mason don't 
   believe in such things, so Father Alvin asks them if they believe in 
   the Devil. They do not reply. Regine asks the Baron if he has a 
   daughter and all he can do is give her a forlorn look.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The castle housekeeper (who was the midwife in the beginning of the 
   film) recognises Corinne and says to her that she was told never to 
   come to the castle again. Who is she really? The castle is thrown in 
   to a state of turmoil when the phone goes dead and the castle is 
   visited by Lisa M&uuml;ller (Erika Blanc; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#DragonflyEachCorpse">A
    DRAGONFLY FOR EACH CORPSE</A></B> - 1973), a sexy young woman in an 
   even sexier outfit who is obviously a succubus. The castle's 
   harmonium begins to play by itself while Father Alvin and Mr. Morris 
   play chess, with Lisa making not-so-subtle advances to the good 
   Father. Howard hits on Corinne and she agrees to meet him behind the 
   stairs at midnight. Nancy, who fancies herself somewhat knowledgable 
   in the art of magic, insist on seeing the Baron's laboratory. We then 
   find out that the Baron is trying to turn lead into gold without the 
   aid of the legendary Philosopher's Stone. Then the shit goes off the 
   rails. Regina screams and everyone runs to her room, where she has a 
   bloody wound on her arm and she doesn't know how it got there. They 
   then hear another scream and run downstairs, finding a dead cat 
   impaled on an ancient torture device. Lisa suddenly appears in Father 
   Alvin's bed, strips naked and tries to temp the not-quite-Father, but 
   he is able to resist her ample charms and she disappears. Father 
   Alvin reads an old book on the Rhoneberg Curse and learns a lot, 
   maybe too much. Since Lisa wasn't successful with Father Alvin, she 
   turns her attention to Max, tempting him with his favorite food and 
   drink. Since Max's sin is GLUTTONY, he eats himself to death, while 
   Lisa smiles and turns a deadly shade of white. Nancy wants Howard to 
   help her look for gold in the Baron's laboratory, but he has other 
   plans, meeting Corinne at the appointed place and time. Nancy's sin 
   is GREED and as she searches for what she thinks is a fortune in 
   gold, Lisa has her drown in a pool of gold dust. Howard and Corinne's 
   sin is LUST and they also meet fitting ends at the hands of Lisa. Can 
   you guess what the other sins that the guests are guilty of (SLOTH, 
   WRATH, ENVY and PRIDE are left)? It's all in this review.&nbsp;

    I have seen this film at least a dozen times and it never gets old. 
   What is amazing to me is that director Jean Brisme'e (that's the way 
   it is spelled in the opening credits) never made anything else of 
   note before or after this. That's a shame, because he shows a sure 
   hand with the material, especially in the way he depicts the guests' 
   major sins and the way they die because of it. It's the minor details 
   here that makes the film so enjoyable to watch, such as Regine's 
   death by snake (A lesbian killed by a snake? How's that for 
   symbolism?!?). While much of the symbolism in this film will go over 
   many people's heads, those that are attuned to such things will be 
   richly rewarded. The screenplay, by Patrice Rhomm 
   (Director/screenwriter of <B><A HREF="fraulein_devil_1977.htm">FRAULEIN

   Garnier (Director of <B><A HREF="tango_of_perversion_1974.htm">TANGO 
   OF PERVERSION</A></B> - 1974) is that perfect blend of horror and 
   atmosphere which many films try to achieve, but which few films are 
   able to deliver. This is definitely a thinking man's horror film, but 
   casual viewers should enjoy it, too. It works on both fronts.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   reason: Walter E. Sear's effective electronic music score, which adds 
   a lot to what is basically a mash-up of&nbsp; Italian cannibal and

   corpse. This hospital has been experiencing a series of missing body 
   parts and organs, so they set up a trap for the thief. We then see 
   the thief cut out the heart of a still-living patient (some trap!) 
   and begins to eat it, but he is caught by Dr. Drydock (Walter 
   Patriarca; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Cannibal Apoc">CANNIBAL APOCALYPSE</A></B> 
   - 1980) and it turns out he is an orderly at the hospital named Toran 
   (Turam Quibo; <B><A HREF="adios_sabata_1970.htm">ADIOS SABATA</A></B> 
   - 1970, using the name &quot;Joseph Persaud&quot;), a native of the 
   Moluccas tribe in the West Indies who pray to Kito, the Cannibal God. 
   Before Dr. Drydock can question him, Toran bolts and jumps through a 
   hospital window, falling to his death (an obvious dummy loses its 
   right arm when it hits the pavement!). Nurse Lori Ridgeway (Alexandra 
   Delli Colli; <B><A HREF="new_york_ripper_1982.htm">NEW YORK RIPPER</A></B> 
   - 1982) notices that Toran has the symbol of Kito tattooed on his 
   chest, a symbol that represents a tribe of cannibals in the Moluccas 
   Islands. Lori knows this because she is an anthropology nut and she 
   has a ceremonial dagger with the symbol of Kito hanging on a wall in 
   her home (it ends up missing).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see Lori traveling to the West Indies with Dr. Peter 
   Chandler (Ian McCulloch; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Contamination1980">CONTAMINATION</A></B> 
   - 1980), N.Y. Express reporter Susan Kelly (Sherry Buchanan; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Eyes Behind Stars">EYES
    BEHIND THE STARS</A></B> - 1977), whose newspaper is financing this 
   expedition, and jack-of-all-trades George Harper (Peter O'Neal; his 
   only film), Once they arrive on one of the islands, they are greeted 
   by Dr. Obrero (Donald O'Brien; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Ghosthouse 1987">GHOSTHOUSE</A></B> 
   - 1987) and he assigns Molotto (Dakar; real name: Alejandro Dakar; <B><A HREF="ator_the_fighting_eagle_1982.htm">ATOR,
    THE FIGHTING EAGLE</A></B> - 1982) to guide them on their expedition 
   to find the tribe that worship Kito. That night, Lori finds a 
   severed, rotting head (complete with maggots) in her bed, along with 
   the symbol of Kito drawn in blood on the sheet. Dr. Obrero assures 
   Lori that if the natives wanted her dead she would be dead (How 
   comforting!). The next morning they begin their expedition through 
   the jungle (without Dr. Obrero), but it is obvious that Molotto is 
   not leading them to their intended destination.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The party lose some of their native crew to spiked booby-traps and 
   they are eventually taken prisoner by a tribe of cannibals, who 
   devour George alive (they slice open George's stomach and chow down 
   on his intestines; they even poke out his eyes with their fingers and 
   eat them!), but just when it looks like curtains for Peter and Lori 
   (Susan is nowhere to be found), some rotting zombies appear in the 
   jungle and scare the cannibals away. Lori, Peter and Molotto run 
   quickly through the jungle and discover that Dr. Obrero is waiting 
   for them. Just what is he doing in the jungle? Peter grows suspicious 
   of Dr. Obrero and rightfully so. It seems the not-so-good doctor 
   wants them to leave the island as quickly as possible. But just what 
   exactly is he up to? Peter aims to find out and takes Lori with him 
   (they decline Dr. Obrero's offer to have Molotto show them the way). 
   After surviving zombie attacks and other jungle booby-traps (Peter 
   kills one zombie with the spinning blades of an outboard motor to its 
   head), they finally discover what Dr. Obrero is doing. They think 
   they see Susan, but it turns out to be a zombie wearing Susan's 
   scalp! We see Dr. Obrero operating on a still-alive (but hairless and 
   scalpless) Susan (he cuts her vocal cords because her screams annoy 
   him!). Dr. Obrero is actually the Dr. Butcher of the title and he is 
   trying to transplant living brains into dead bodies, thereby being 
   the first person to successfully perform a brain transplant. All his 
   previous tries have been failures (which is why there are zombies 
   everywhere) and he tells Peter that he hopes to expand human life by 
   over a hundred years, but he believes he needs civilized brains for 
   his operation to be successful. He plans on using Peter's brain to 
   reach his goal. Will Dr. Butcher be successful?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    DEATH: SEEKER OF SOULS</A><A NAME="Doctor Death"></A> (1973) - </B>&quot;Enter
    that body! Enter that body! I command you, enter that body!&quot; 
   Once you hear this phrase, be prepared to laugh hysterically. This 
   little gem from the early 70's should fail on every level. It's 
   statically filmed like a 70's TV movie. The acting is so broad that 
   it becomes hard to overlook. And the plot is so absurd that it is 
   laughable. Guess what? I believe that all these points are deliberate 
   and gel together beautifully. Fred Saunders (Barry Coe) loses his 
   beautiful wife Laura (Jo Morrow) in an automobile accident. Before 
   she dies, she promises Fred that she will somehow come back and be 
   with him. He preserves her body and places it in a tomb where he 
   instructs the caretaker, Franz (Jim Boles), to leave it unlocked so 
   he can come back and look at her body. An obsessed Fred tries to <A HREF="doctor_death_seeker_of_souls_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/doctor death poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="262" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>find
    a way to bring his wife back from the dead, visiting a phony medium 
   and a crazy death-worshipping cult, with no success (but much 
   enjoyment for the viewer). He then spots an ad in an alternative 
   newspaper advertising a way to reincarnate souls. He answers the ad 
   and meets Tana (Florence &quot;<B><A HREF="queen_of_blood_1966.htm">QUEEN
    OF BLOOD</A></B>&quot; Marley), a representative for a doctor that 
   can solve Fred's problem. She takes him to a demonstration given by 
   Doctor Death (John Considine), who has found a way to transfer souls 
   from murdered bodies to corpses! His demo consists of transfering the 
   soul of a horribly-scarred girl (who he saws in half simply for the 
   &quot;theatrics&quot;) to the body of a dead beautiful girl. When she 
   rises to life, Fred at first rejects the notion of transferring 
   another soul to his wife's body (&quot;It won't actually be her 
   coming back to life, will it?&quot; he asks the Doctor) but soon 
   relents since he misses her so much.&nbsp; Doctor Death and his 
   facially-scarred mute servant Thor (Leon Askin) then murder Tana in 
   front of Fred, buy throwing a knife into her heart (theatrics again). 
   Fred, who is horrified, wants nothing to do with it but is forced by 
   Doctor Death to go along. When the good doctor tries to transfer 
   Tana's soul into Laura, it is unsuccessful, because Laura's will, 
   even in death, is too strong. Fred sees this as a sign to stop but 
   Doctor Death sees this merely as a challenge and soon (unbeknownst to 
   Fred) begins murdering young girls in various ways, capturing their 
   souls and, time after time, failing miserably in transferring their 
   souls to Laura's body (this is where the phrase at the top of this 
   review comes into play.). Meanwhile, Fred has moved on and begins 
   dating his secretary Sandy (Cheryl Miller). When Fred is delivered a 
   severed head of one of the murdered girls to his office by Doctor 
   Death (who leaves a note telling Fred that he will complete their 
   contract no matter how many girls he has to kill), Fred springs into 
   action and, with his physician friend Greg (Stewart Moss) and a 
   couple of policemen, sets out to stop Doctor Death. Unfortunately, 
   Doctor Death has kidnapped Sandy and is slowly bleeding her to death, 
   in hopes that her soul will be the final one he needs to bring Laura 
   back to life. Will Fred arrive in time and stop Doctor Death?&nbsp; 
   This wonderful little-seen gem delights in so many ways that it 
   should be viewed by all lovers of 70's horror. Surprisingly, it is 
   nudity-free (but full of beautiful women in various state of undress) 
   and the blood doesn't really flow until about the 45 minute mark. 
   When it does come, it is shocking and hysterical at the same time. 
   When Doctor Death is stabbed in the stomach by a young man he has 
   attacked, his blood squirts on the man's face, melting it like acid! 
   There are various other bloody bits that earned it an R-rating when 
   regionally released to theaters in 1973. I'll leave them for you to 
   discover. The real standout here is John Considine (<B><A HREF="thirsty_dead_1974.htm">THE
    THIRSTY DEAD</A></B> - 1974, and long-time soap opera actor), whose 
   over-the-top portrayal as Doctor Death lifts this film from simple 
   black comedy to the overly surreal. He digs his nails into this role 
   and the viewer is greatly rewarded for the experience. I was laughing 
   constantly at his failed attempts to revive Laura. Director Eddie 
   Saeta, who died in 2005, sadly never directed another theatrical film 
   (he previously directed a couple of series TV episodes) but was a 
   jack-of-all-trades in motion pictures, being producer, assistant 
   director and production manager on many major films right up till his 
   death. As I said earlier, the film has a TV-movie look, but switches 
   to almost dream-like sequences at the most unexpected moments (such 
   as Fred's visit to the death-worshipping cult), throwing the viewer 
   for a loop. Silver-haired Stooge Moe Howard (his last role) makes a 
   cameo as an audience member who assists Doctor Death in confirming 
   that a woman's body is dead (and makes a sexual quip about the 
   experience) as does horror host Larry &quot;Seymour&quot; Vincent, 
   who appears as a killer in a film shown on a victim's television. Add 
   a finale that is creepy (and should have spawned a sequel but, alas, 
   it never happened) and you have a great unsung minor classic that has 
   managed to stay mostly unseen (at least in the New York area) for 
   over 30 years. A <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Prism">Prism Entertainment</A>

   then on Public Domain DVD compilations, so I always hoped that 
   someone, anyone, would release a widescreen version, since all we 
   have gotten over the years were dupey-looking fullscreen versions. 
   Film Chest announced a &quot;Digitally Remastered&quot; DVD version 
   late in 2014, and while it looks better than most versions of the 
   film, it was still the fullscreen version. I've actually had people 
   tell me that it was filmed in fullscreen, but they are full of shit 
   because I have seen this film at least ten times in theaters <A HREF="don't_look_in_the_basement_1973b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/don't look in the basement-last house on the left ad mat14 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="232" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>and
    it most certainly was in widescreen. I think most companies don't 
   want to release a widescreen version because they think that the 
   fullscreen version has saturated the market and no one will buy it, 
   but just look at Code Red's widescreen version of <B><A HREF="#SilentNightBloody72">SILENT
    NIGHT, BLOODY NIGHT</A></B> (1972), which they released in 
   widescreen after nearly every DVD compilation company had their 
   fullscreen version and companies will see that there is success in 
   releasing PD features in their proper aspect ratio, as long as some 
   time is taken to restore the film (like Code Red did). Even though 
   Texan director/producer S.F. Brownrigg only did a handful of films, 
   they were memorable films, not just because they were sleazy (which 
   they certainly were), but because they were also well-acted by a cast 
   faithful to Brownrigg, who would appear in nearly every film he did 
   (and a lot of the actors go back to the 60's Texas exploitation 
   scene, where they were just as committed to Larry Buchannan). This is 
   Brownrigg's first film (shot in 12 days on a budget of $100,000) and 
   it is still my favorite (although his <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Poor White Trash 2">POOR
    WHITE TRASH PART II</A></B> [1974] runs a very close second). The 
   film is quite complex in its storyline: The film opens with Nurse 
   Jane (Jessie Lee Fulton) telling the head psychiatrist at Stephens 
   Sanitorium, Dr. Stephens (Michael Harvey), that she can't stay on any 
   longer and she is leaving because she finds his methods of dealing 
   with patients too unsettling. For instance, he has the violent Judge 
   Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross, who is simply terrific in the entire 
   film and will send chills down your spine) chopping a log with an axe 
   to release his aggressions, but he sneaks behind Dr. Stephen while he 
   is taking to Nurse Jane and plants the axe in his back, killing him. 
   Dr. Masters (Anne MacAdams) tells everyone to keep Dr. Stephens' 
   death a secret, at least for now. We are introduced to the patients: 
   Harriett (Camilla Carr), a mentally unstable woman who keeps a doll 
   and treats it as her baby. When someone steals the doll and puts it 
   in Nurse Jane's bedroom, Harriett kills her. Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh 
   Feagin), who spends every night looking out his bedroom window with 
   binoculars, trying to spot &quot;Them&quot;. Danny (Jessie Kirby), an always-laughing
    young red-headed adult who gets off on stealing Harriett's doll and 
   playing practical jokes on the rest of the patients and crew. 
   Jennifer (Maryette Warren), a very bashful girl who needs someone to 
   open her up (that person will be arriving shortly). Judge Cameron 
   (who we had the pleasure of meeting in the beginning of the film), 
   who is always passing judgment on the patients and the staff. Allyson 
   (Betty Chandler), who is such a nymphomaniac, if it has two legs, 
   she'll fuck it. And finally, the hulking black man Sam (William Bill 
   McGhee), who loves Dr. Masters just as much as he loves Popsicles and 
   will do pretty much what Dr. Masters says. Even though he's the 
   biggest patient of the bunch, he's just a gentle giant. Arriving at 
   the Stephens Sanitorium is Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik), who Dr. 
   Stephens hired as a nurse before he was murdered. This worries Dr. 
   Masters very much, but when Charlotte mentions that maybe she should 
   go to the local police to report Dr. Stephens missing, Dr. Masters 
   hires her rather reluctantly. It is then that Charlotte meets the 
   final patient in the Sanitorium, the elderly Mrs. Callingham (Rhea 
   MacAdams, who could scare the white off of rice; she was in her upper 
   80's when she took this role), who warns Charlotte, &quot;Get out! 
   Get out! And never ever come back for any reason!&quot; (It scared 
   the shit even out of me!). Charlotte is introduced to the rest of the 
   patients, who welcome her with open arms, especially Sam and Jennifer 
   (who is rather schizophrenic). Dr. Masters mentions to Charlotte that 
   she will be sleeping on the same floor as the patients, because Dr. 
   Stephens thought both patients and staff should live side-by-side 
   with no locks on the doors (this is unheard of in every sanitorium in 
   the world!). The next morning, Nurse Charlotte checks up on old Mrs. 
   Callingham, only to discover her on the floor, her face all bloody 
   and her tongue missing. Dr. Masters tells Charlotte that Mrs. 
   Callingham was into self-mutilation, but when Charlotte asks where 
   her tongue is, Dr. Masters says she probably ate it! (A conversation 
   I don't remember being in any version I ever saw). The phones haven't 
   been working for several days (I wonder why?) and Dr. Masters says 
   she will take care of it, but when she doesn't and telephone 
   repairman Ray Daniels (Robert Dracup) shows up on his own and asks 
   Dr. Masters why she never reported it (seems like the phone company 
   noticed the outage on their own and decided to check it out), Dr. 
   Masters has no choice but to let him fix the phones, but not before 
   chewing him out for talking to the patients. The phone board is in a 
   closet and nymphomaniac Allyson traps him in there (and makes him 
   promise to marry her) and we have to let our imaginations take over 
   as to what happens. Next, for some unknown reason, Jennifer tries to 
   stab Charlotte with a knife (I told you she was schizophrenic), but 
   Dr. Masters slaps her in the face (very unusual treatment by a doctor 
   to her patient). Dr. Masters then finds a handwritten note in 
   Sergeant Jaffee's room (we are not allowed to read it), so she 
   crumples it up. sets it on fire and makes the Sergeant hold it in his 
   hand untils it burns out completely (Say, what kind of doctor is 
   Doctor Masters? Doctor of Sadism?). Sam wants to tell Charlotte what 
   happened to Dr. Stephens, but he gives her Dr. Stephens' pocket watch 
   and hopes she figures it out on her own. Danny tries to rape 
   Charlotte (so much for not having locks on the doors), but Judge 
   Cameron is her savior and tosses Danny out of her room (He may be a 
   killer, but he does have a conscience). Some drugs end up missing 
   from the Infirmary (located in Dr. Masters' office), so Dr. Masters 
   checks everyone's rooms and finds the drugs in Jennifer's bureau 
   drawer (which would explain her schizophrenia). Jennifer enters Dr. 
   Masters' offices and sees the drugs on her desk, but before she can 
   steal them again, someone shoves her head on one of those pointy note 
   holders, which pierces her eye and goes into her brain, killing her 
   (what kind of Sanitorium has a pointy note holder?). Sam finds phone 
   repairman's Ray Daniel's body in a closet (his throat has been cut) 
   and Allyson freaks out. Allyson tells Charlotte that Dr. Masters is 
   actually a patient pretending to be a doctor and that is why the 
   phones are still not fixed. She will not let anyone enter or leave 
   the asylum alive. It seems that the inmates have been running the 
   asylum for some time now and inmate &quot;Dr. Masters&quot; is the 
   executioner. Judge Cameron tells Charlotte that everyone voted and 
   decided that she would be one of the inmates, which will save her 
   life from being murdered by Dr. Masters. Charlotte naturally becomes 
   concered and first asks Mrs. Callingham if Dr. Masters cut out her 
   tongue. She shakes her head yes. Screwball loony Danny scares the 
   shit out of Charlotte, so she runs upstairs to Allyson's room, where 
   Allyson is making love to Ray Daniels' corpse. Allyson has a bloody 
   face and says to Charlotte, &quot;You shouldn't interrupt us on our 
   wedding night!&quot; Charlotte is naturally repulsed and gets the dry 
   heaves, so she runs downstairs to Dr. Masters' office and sees the 
   body of Jennifer with the pointy note holder still impaled in her 
   eye. A bunch of other stuff happens that leads to Charlotte trying to 
   find Sam in the basement and discovering the rotting body of Dr. 
   Stephens. Dr. Masters then puts Charlotte on a bed and tells Sam to 
   kill her, but Sam likes Charlotte too much and leads her outside to 
   safety. Meanwhile, all the other patients, who are carrying axes and 
   knives, corner Dr. Masters in the bedroom and begin chopping and 
   stabbing away at her while she is lying on the bed (if you look close 
   enough, you can see one of the rubber axe blades fall off the 
   handle!). When Sam returns and sees what they have done to his 
   beloved Dr. Masters, he kills them all, their bodies in different 
   states of bloodiness. Sam goes downstairs to the kitchen, cries and 
   eats a Popsicle, his second favorite thing in the whole world. The 
   film ends with Mrs. Callingham saying directly to the audience, 
   &quot;Get out! And never ever<A HREF="dont_look_in_the_basement_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/don't look in the basement dvd8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="290" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   come back!&quot; (Still scary as fuck!).&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure the film is 
   hokey, but it has one of those regional sleaze factors not found in 
   many films. Brownrigg made all his films in Texas using Texas talent 
   and, for the most part, they were damn fine actors. I believe Gene 
   Ross was the most successful of Brownrigg's stock players, as he made 
   both independent productions (<B><A HREF="legend_of_boggy_creek_1972.htm">THE

    STREET BLUES</A></B> in 1984 and <B><A HREF="cagney_&amp;_lacey_tv_movies.htm">CAGNEY
    &amp; LACEY</A></B> in 1986). You can tell by his role as Judge 
   Cameron in this film that he had real talent. He is a murderer, who 
   we also feel pity for and he is not just a crazy mental patient 
   without a soul. Some of his scenes, especially his discussions with 
   Dr. Masters, are true forms of acting usually not found in films of 
   this type. Gene Ross is still alive today (at least at the time of 
   this review), but he hasn't done anything since 1999. Screenwriter 
   Tim Pope (his only screenplay) went on to be a successful director of 
   music videos, for musicians and bands such as Queen, The Cure, Men 
   Without Hats, The Pretenders, The Bangles, Iggy Pop, David Bowie, Ric 
   Okasek and even directed the movie <B><A HREF="crow_city_of_angels_1996.htm">THE
    CROW: CITY OF ANGELS</A></B> (1996). Originally released as <B><A HREF="dont_look_in_the_basement_1973.htm">THE
    FORGOTTEN</A></B>, the film did less than mediocre business. It was 
   only when <A HREF="hallmark_releasing_ad_mats.htm">Hallmark Releasing</A>

   &quot;It's only a movie...It's only a movie...&quot; did the film 
   take off and make bundles of money, none of which Brownrigg ever saw. 
   It was also later released as <B><A HREF="dont_look_in_the_basement_1973.htm">DEATH
    WARD NO. 13</A></B> and <B><A HREF="dont_look_in_the_basement_1973.htm">THE
    SNAKE PIT</A></B> to get audiences to think they were watching new 
   films. I enjoyed this film no matter what title it was released 
   under. Out of all the U.S. VHS releases this film had, (from <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#United-VCI">VCI
    Entertainment</A> [who also released a poor DVD] and <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#VidAmerica">VidAmerica,
    Inc</A>), the best looking edition would have to be from <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Gorgon">Gorgon
    Entertainment</A>, because the other editions are missing footage 
   (the VidAmerica edition looks to be the TV version, since it is 
   missing over seven minutes of footage). While none of the DVD 
   versions (Including the version in the <B><A HREF="vault_of_horror_10 movie_compilation.htm">VAULT
    OF HORROR 10 MOVIE COMPILATION</A></B>) look very good, the latest 
   offering from Film Chest does looked cleaned-up somewhat and some of 
   the scenes that were way too dark in other versions are now visible. 
   That's not a ringing endorsement, because it was obviously taken from 
   a beat-up film element, so how much more time would it have taken 
   them to make it widescreen instead of fullscreen? As soon as any 
   company releases a widescreen version, I will be the first on line to 
   buy it, because it is more than obvious that some information is 
   missing from the sides (and it is a very important film from my 
   teenage years). S.F. Brownrigg's (who passed away in 1996) son, 
   Anthony Brownrigg, made a reboot/sequel, <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DontLookBase214">DON'T
    LOOK IN THE BASEMENT 2</A></B> in 2014 (co-starring Camilla Carr, 
   who is portraying a different character than the one who died in the 
   first film). It was a crowd-funded project and from what I hear it is 
   pretty bad. I'll hold my tongue until I actually see it (see my 
   review <A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DontLookBase214">HERE</A>), but a

    on video for years in various dupey, unwatchable editions. I should 
   know. I own most of them. Why haven't I viewed any of them? Because 
   this film scared the shit out of me when I saw it on TV in the middle 
   1960's as a pimply-faced kid. It introduced me to the horrors of 
   leprosy, a disease I had never heard of before watching this film. It 
   left an indelible impression on me, an impression that is as fresh 
   today as it was 50 years ago. That is why I won't watch any of the 
   video versions I own. I don't want to destroy my memories of that day 
   with a crappy, third or fourth generation copy. Imagine my surprise 
   of finding this film on DVD while doing one of my weekly trash film 
   runs at the local Best Buy. And it cost only $5.99! Released by 
   company <A HREF="http://www.oldies.com">Alpha Video</A>, this DVD 
   contains the best-looking copy that you're likely ever to see of a 
   film of this vintage and pedigree (at the time of this review; things 
   have changed as you can read below). It's far from perfect, as the 
   colors have faded and the whole film has a brownish tint to it, but 
   it is watchable and therefore worth every cent it cost me. So, what's 
   the verdict? I am glad to report that my memories didn't deceive me 
   this time. As an adult, I can see that this is an impossibly cheap 
   film which opens with the lamest shipwreck ever committed to 
   celluloid (later, check out the rubber bat and giant toy spider), 
   contains acting that can politely be called wooden, has bad library 
   music and sets that are made of cardboard. But that just adds to its' 
   overall charm. On the plus side, there's a fair amount of blood for 
   an early '60's effort, some sadistic torture scenes and the last 20 
   minutes which involve a chained-up aristocrat being seduced by a 
   whacked-out leprosy-ridden Countess in a wedding dress. Want to know 
   more? Spend the six bucks and take this baby home. Directed by late 
   comic book artist Pat Boyette (who also directed the hard-to-find 
   films <B><A HREF="weird_ones_1962.htm">THE WEIRD ONES</A></B> and <B>N</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">O

   [both also in 1962]) more in the vein of a filmed theatrical 
   production than an actual movie. The whole film looks and sounds like 
   a stage play with just enough outdoor locations (filmed in San 
   Antonio, Texas) to relieve the claustrophobic interior scenes. 
   Boyette (who also wrote this with Henry Garcia) also gives this film 
   a real downbeat ending, something unheard of in a film of its time. 
   I'm glad I waited all these years. It was euphoric reliving a memory 
   that made such an impact on my youth. Starring Russ Harvey (also the 
   film's producer), Helen Hogan, William McNulty, Michelle Buquor,

   hospital, he tells a frightening story to the staff psychiatrist. He 
   and three college friends travel to their professor's cabin in the 
   mountains to assist in a dig. They find the cabin destroyed and

    Our heroine is Emma (Margherita Remotti), a Professor of Womens 
   Studies at a university in Rome. She makes a long trip to the town of 
   Voghera, Italy to take a tour of an archaeological dig next to &quot;<A HREF="evil_river_2016.htm#Shanda'sRiver">Shanda's
    River</A>&quot; (the original title of the film), named after a 14th 
   Century woman who was accused of being a witch and causing the deaths 
   of thousands of people, when they actually died of the Plague. The 
   superstitious townspeople banded together and drowned Shanda in the 
   river and ever since then there have been a series of strange murders 
   near the river where Shanda was killed, dubbed the &quot;Red River 
   Murders&quot;, where the police believe there is a serial killer on 
   the loose. Could it be Shanda who is actually killing these people in 
   retribution for her death? On the long train ride to Voghera, Emma 
   has a dream where she sees Shanda (Marcella Braga; <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm#WrathOfTheCrows2013">WRATH
    OF THE CROWS</A></B> - 2013) rip out her eyes with her own hands and 
   offer them to Emma. When she wakes up, Emma is at Voghera and waits 
   for someone to pick her up. While she is sitting on a bench, Emma 
   sees a <A HREF="evil_river_2016.htm#Symbol">strange symbol</A> drawn 
   on the ground, a red outline of a circle with a solid red circle in 
   the middle if it. Emma doesn't know it, but she will see that symbol 
   many, many times during her stay in this strange town, but what does 
   it mean?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Emma is picked up by Giulia (Claudia Marasca; <B><A HREF="broken_key_2017.htm">THE
    BROKEN KEY</A></B> - 2017), who will be her tour guide at the dig 
   site. She hands Emma a bottle of her wine, made from her family's 
   vineyard and takes Emma to her hotel room, telling her she will pick 
   her up tomorrow at 7:00 AM for the tour. Emma, who is very tired from 
   the long trip, immediately goes to bed and once again has the dream 
   of Emma ripping her eyes out and offering them to her. Emma wakes up 
   and it is 4:00 AM, so she takes a shower and waits for Giulia to pick 
   her up. Guilia knocks on her door at 7:00 AM and tells Emma that they 
   will have another person joining them on the tour, a Croatian 
   investigative reporter named Daniel Roth (Diego Runko), saying he 
   offered her so much money she couldn't say no, apologizing to Emma. 
   Daniel arrives and introduced himself to Emma and they make the drive 
   to the dig site. On the way, Giulia gives Daniel and Emma a short 
   history on Shanda and Emma interrupts and says her information is 
   wrong. Daniel asks Emma if she is a reporter, too, and she tells him 
   no, she's a Professor of Womens Studies who decided to write a book 
   on witches, only her book will be nothing but the truth, nothing made 
   up or sensationalized like Giulia's story. On the way to the dig 
   site, Giulia's car stalls and she gets out to check what the problem 
   is and notices that it is leaking oil. While she makes a phone call 
   to her brother to bring over his car for them to use and to call a 
   tow truck, Daniel and Emma get out of the car to offer some help. 
   Emma notices two strange people in black robes and very eerie demonic 
   masks walking towards them, so she warns Daniel to come back to the 
   car. One of the men knocks out Daniel and the other comes to the car 
   and knocks out Emma. When Emma wakes up, she discovers that she and 
   Daniel are tied to separate trees and on the tree opposite her is the 
   red symbol, seemingly painted in blood. One of the robed men walks up 
   to Daniel and disembowels him with a dagger, pulling out his offal 
   with his bare hands. He then walks over to Emma, says something in a 
   language Emma doesn't understand, makes her eat Daniel's guts (!) and 
   when she spits it out, he slices her throat (rather graphically) with 
   the dagger. Emma then wakes up in her hotel room and it's 4:00 AM. 
   She thinks it was nothing but a nightmare caused by drinking Giulia's 
   bottle of wine, so she goes to the bathroom, takes a shower and waits 
   for Giulia to arrive. Giulia arrives at 7:00 AM and tells Emma that 
   they will have another person joining them on the tour, a Croatian 
   investigative reporter named Daniel Roth. Uh, oh! Is Emma caught in 
   some time loop or is there another reason why this is happening? Emma 
   decides to go on the tour anyway and the same exact thing happens, 
   only this time when she wakes up tied to the tree, the robed man 
   kills Daniel and then walks over to her, mumbles something in a 
   strange language and bashes Emma's head in with his wooden staff. 
   Once again, Emma wakes up in her hotel room and it is 4:00 AM, but 
   this time when Giulia arrives at 7:00 AM, Emma tells her she is too 
   ill to go on the tour, so Giulia leaves. Thinking that she has 
   stopped the strange time loop, Emma relaxes and takes a shower, only 
   for the two robed men to break into her hotel room, once again 
   whispering something to her that she doesn't understand and then kill 
   her again. Once again she wakes up in her hotel room and it's 4:00 
   AM... To save time (and my slow typing skills), I will briefly tells 
   you the events that happen to Emma before she wakes up in her hotel 
   room at 4:00 AM. During each &quot;time loop&quot;, Emma will learn 
   something that will aid her in stopping this nightmare once and for all::</FONT></FONT></P>

    This excellent, thought-provoking horror flick, directed by Marco 
   Rosson (<B><A HREF="new_order_2012.htm">NEW ORDER</A></B> - 2012, 
   with Franco Nero; and many music videos for bands you never heard of) 
   and written by Nicola Pizzi (His only feature film screenplay, 
   although he has worked in various capacities on several genre films, 
   including an Electrician on <B><A HREF="at_the_devils_door_2013.htm">AT

    OR DARE?</A></B> [2018]), surprised me several times&nbsp; and even 
   made me twitch during a certain jump scare (you'll know it when you 
   see it). The major plus this film offers is the performance by the 
   basically unknown Margherita Remotti, who imbues her character of 
   Emma with a real heart and soul. While she is not an example of a 
   beautiful woman by any stretch of the imagination, it was certainly a 
   delight seeing a naked woman who was all natural, not injected with 
   silicone or plastic to make her look like a &quot;starlet&quot;. 
   She's a real woman and her performance is remarkable, especially when 
   she learns to accept her many deaths and how she deals with it. I 
   accidentally discovered this film while searching &quot;Italian 
   Horror Movies&quot; on Amazon Prime and this is one time the search 
   turned up a really great film, one that I can recommend to all my 
   readers, especially since it is free if you are a Prime member. I 
   love discovering unsung gems such as this and as I said before, it 
   restores my faith in modern day Italian genre films. Granted, there 
   is a lot of crap out there, but this isn't one of them! Also

   of Robert, the Earl of Binbrook (a scientist working on experiments 
   involving the &quot;transmutation of human cells&quot;), digging up 
   the grave of his wife Elizabeth. After a quick flash-forward, where 
   Michael says, &quot;I am leaving my ancestral home of Castle Binbrook 
   because I can no longer bear the silence of death&quot;, the film 
   then flashes-back a few days earlier to show us how Michael ended up 
   in this predicament. We see Michael arriving by train to his 
   ancestral home, expecting to see his wife Elizabeth (In&eacute;s 
   Morales, as &quot;Senny Green&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#HousePsychoticWomen">THE
    HOUSE OF PSYCHOTIC WOMEN</A></B> - 1973), after being away on 
   business for a few months, hoping to be told he is now a father, 
   since Elizabeth was pregnant with his child. He is met at the train 
   station by Robert's wife, Lady Anne (Catharine Ellison), and his 
   niece, Margaret (Beatriz Elorrieta, as &quot;Beatriz Lacy&quot;; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightOfThe Werewolf">NIGHT
    OF THE WEREWOLF</A></B> - 1980), but not by his wife. When he asks 
   where Elizabeth is, Michael can see by the looks on Lady Anne and 
   Margaret's faces that it is not good news, yet all they will tell him 
   is that Elizabeth and her baby (a girl) are dead, but they will not 
   tell Michael how she died. Michael then goes to the house of his 
   mother-in-law, Barbara (Mar&iacute;a Paz Madrid, as &quot;Yocasta 
   Grey&quot;), but she tells her two daughters, Pamela (Marisa Shiero) 
   and Lily (Titania Clement; <B><A HREF="specter_of_terror_1973.htm">THE
    SPECTER OF TERROR</A></B> - 1973), not to answer the door, yet Lily 
   ignores her mother and lets Michael inside. Michael demands to know 
   how Elizabeth died and Barbara blames her death on him, saying his 
   job was more important than his marriage to her daughter, telling 
   Michael that Elizabeth died of a broken heart, waiting every day for 
   his letters to arrive, but they never did. Michael says that isn't 
   true, he wrote her every day he was away, but Barbara calls him a 
   liar, telling him if he wants to know how Elizabeth died, he should 
   talk to Dr. Kinberg (Antonio Jim&eacute;nez Escribano; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#ScreamDemonLover70">SCREAM
    OF THE DEMON LOVER</A></B> - 1970), who signed Elizabeth's death 
   certificate. When Michael goes to Dr. Kinberg's office, he refuses to 
   tell Michael how Elizabeth died, saying that Robert's personal 
   physician, Dr. Lexter (Frank Bra&ntilde;a; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Pieces">PIECES</A></B> 
   - 1982), was taking care of Elizabeth. Dr. Kinberg also tells Michael 
   that Dr. Lexter made him sign Elizabeth's death certificate and if he 
   wants to know how his wife died, to go to town hall and get a copy of 
   the death certificate. Why won't anyone tell Michael how his wife 
   really died? And where is Robert (Michael hasn't seen him since he 
   came back)? What are they hiding?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Michael get a copy of the death certificate, it says that Dr. 
   Lexter had to perform a Caesarean section on Elizabeth to remove the 
   baby girl, which was stillborn and already dead. Elizabeth died 
   during the Caesarean because she was too weak. When Michael talks to 
   Dr. Lexter, he refuses to elaborate and Michael becomes very 
   suspicious, especially when Lexter won't tell him where Robert is 
   (All we hear is it will take six months before we know the truth 
   about Robert). Michael is even more determined to discover how his 
   wife died, especially to see if Robert had anything to do with it, so 
   he goes to family cemetery gravedigger Mr. Fowles (Victor Israel; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#HouseInsaneWomen71">HOUSE
    OF INSANE WOMEN</A></B> - 1971) and asks him to dig up Elizabeth's 
   coffin, but he refuses and tells Michael to leave immediately or he 
   will call the police. Michael has no other choice than to sneak into 
   the cemetery at night and dig up Elizabeth's coffin (bringing us to 
   the beginning of the film), but when he does, he finds her coffin 
   empty. There has been an unusually high amount of deaths in the 
   village recently, so Michael also digs up their coffins, also finding 
   them empty. Before he can report it to the police, two robed figures 
   wearing old men horror masks enter the cemetery and knock Michael 
   out, placing his unconscious body in a tomb next to a fresh mound of 
   dirt with medical tubing running into it; the dirt moving up and 
   down, as if to the beating of a heart. One of the robed figures 
   removes the tubing from the mound of dirt and walks away. When 
   Michael wakes up, he sees some type of monster arise from the dirt 
   (all we see are its eyes and hands), which attacks him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next day, Michael is reported missing (but we know he's alive, 
   thanks to the flash-forward in the beginning of the film, where he 
   has a cast on one foot and walks with the aid of a cane), but someone 
   is pretending to be him, playing Michael's favorite tune on his 
   harmonica (Michael always had it on him until Pamela stole it). It 
   wouldn't be too much of a give-away to state the person pretending to 
   be Michael is Police Inspector Harrison (John Clark; <B><A HREF="town_called_hell_1971.htm">A
    TOWN CALLED HELL</A></B> - 1971), who is investigating the abnormal 
   amount of deaths in the village, all of their death certificates 
   being signed by Dr. Lexter and Dr. Kinberg. Some type of monster 
   attacks a young boy playing in the snow, mauling his foot. The more 
   Elizabeth's sisters hear Michael's tune being played on the 
   harmonica, secrets are revealed, such as Pamela and Lily having 
   lustful crushes on Michael and trying their damnest to get him into 
   bed, but with no luck, because he only loved Elizabeth.&nbsp; When it 
   is revealed that it was Pamela who stole all of Michael's letters to 
   Elizabeth before she could read them, we begin to semi-understand 
   what is going on and who this monster really is. Why is Inspector 
   Harrison pretending to be Michael? Why is Dr. Lexter murdering people 
   (also making Dr. Kinberg sign some of the death certificates) and 
   robbing Lady Anne of all Robert's wealth? Why does the monster eat 
   the bodies of the murdered people and only leave their heads uneaten? 
   It's all related in a very twisted way, which you will discover if 
   you make it to the film's finale without losing your mind.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film plays like a 19th Century Gothic horror film and if it 
   weren't for some (very few) modern-day trappings (such as Michael's 
   car and<A HREF="graveyard_of_horror_1971.htm#Necrophagus"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/graveyard of horror aka necrophagus spanish poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="307" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   the train ride), you would swear it was taking place in the 
   late-1800's. Director/screenwriter &quot;Michael Skaife&quot; is 
   actually Miguel Madrid, director/writer of <B><A HREF="killing_of_the_dolls_1975.htm">KILLING
    OF THE DOLLS</A></B> (1975) and one of the screenwriters of <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#FeastOfSatan">THE
    FEAST OF SATAN</A></B> (1971). Since this was Madrid's freshman turn 
   at directing (his resum&eacute; is very thin, as he only directed 
   three features and has six writing credits; he passed away in 1996), 
   it's obvious he was learning here, as none of the scenes seem to have 
   any connective tissue to what came before or after it, making it a 
   nightmare for editor Mar&iacute;a Luisa Soriano (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CurseOfTheDevil1973">CURSE
    OF THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1973; <B><A HREF="mummys_revenge_1975.htm">THE
    MUMMY'S REVENGE</A></B> - 1975) to make sense of. But that's exactly 
   what makes this film such a surreal experience. You may not 
   understand it, but you won't be able to take your eyes off the 
   screen. There are a lot of unanswered questions in the film, though, 
   the main one being: Why does Mr. Fowles bleach the skulls of the 
   monster's victims and leave them in the cemetery for a &quot;Mr. 
   Skaife&quot; (Madrid, in an inside joke cameo) to collect and hand 
   over to Dr. Kinberg? The only thing I can think of is that Fowles is 
   covering-up the monster's murders, but I can neither defend or refute 
   that theory, since Dr. Kinberg tells Inspector Harrison that one of 
   the skulls he is examining is Elizabeth's.&nbsp; If you are wondering 
   why we don't fully see the monster until the film's finale, it's 
   because it is a hoary creation; quite cheap-looking and laughable. 
   This film may not be everyone's cup of tea (what is?), but those in 
   the right frame of mind (you know who you are) will find much to 
   enjoy here, even if it's for all the wrong reasons.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Besides having my favorite artwork on any VHS cover of all time (by 
   Wizard Video), this is a short mindfuck of a film that many people 
   put down (and I can see why), but it is still a grimy little horror 
   film about a man obsessed. The fact that it is badly edited, sound 
   recorded and has some of the most overwrought dialogue you will ever 
   hear delivered in a film, only adds to its twisted (you'll hear that 
   word again) charms. This strangely fascinating gore flick has the 
   production values of a porno flick from the time period, which should 
   come as no surprise, since Henri Pachard produced it using his common 
   pseudonym &quot;Ronald Sullivan&quot;. Pachard directed over 360 
   films, 99% of them porno, before he passed away in 2008. It is the 
   first film directed and written by Kent Batemen, whose next film 
   would be <A HREF="headless_eyes_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/headless eyes vhs front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="193" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>the
    G-Rated <B><A HREF="land_of_no_return_1978.htm">THE LAND OF NO RETURN</A></B> 
   (1978), starring William Shatner and Mel Torm&eacute;, but he is 
   better known as the father of actors Jason &amp; Justine Bateman and 
   even worked on some of his kids' TV shows and movies in various 
   capacities. I wish he would have stuck with films like this because, 
   as bad as it is, it still holds up today in sheer weirdness. It's 
   like hallucinating without the use of illegal drugs. The film opens 
   with basically unknown artist Malcolm (Bo Brundin; who had a major 
   role in Jerry Lewis' notoriously unreleased film <B><A HREF="day_the_clown_cried_1972.htm">THE
    DAY THE CLOWN CRIED</A></B> - 1972) breaking into a woman's 
   apartment to steal her valuables. The woman wakes up and starts 
   screaming, so Malcolm puts his hand over her mouth (while saying he 
   needs $65.00 to pay the rent!). The woman reaches for a teaspoon off 
   her night table and scoops-out Malcolm's left eye (there a bad edit 
   here where Malcolm has his hand over his eye [edit] and then it 
   starts to bleed through his fingers) and he screams &quot;My eye! 
   AIEEE!&quot; while he stumbles out of the apartment building via the 
   fire escape and we see his eye hanging out of its socket (his screams 
   are looped at least a half dozen times). He falls to the New York 
   City sidewalk, where a group of people gather around him to gawk (We 
   see it from his POV as the camera looks up from the pavement and the 
   screen turns red just as Kent Bateman's credits are shown on the 
   screen. None of the other three actors listed are given character 
   names and there are no end credits, so the rest of the cast's 
   fictional and real names are guesses on my part). A couple of years 
   later, the eyepatch-wearing Malcolm runs a small art store and it is 
   obvious that he is quite mad and obsessed with eyes, as the camera 
   pans over one of Malcolm's paintings of an eye, then a set of real 
   eyes encased in lucite and, finally, a shot of Malcolm's hands 
   performing some home surgery on a human eyeball (he even has a mobile 
   hanging from his ceiling made of nothing but human eyeballs!). 
   Malcolm has visions of blood flowing over a human eye, so he goes to 
   his refrigerator, pulls out a container from his freezer and runs hot 
   water over it until we see that there was an eye encased in the ice 
   (perhaps his own?). It's quite apparent that Malcolm is crazy as a 
   loon and has been killing people for their eyes, as he talks to 
   himself (Brundin's Swedish accent only adds to the creepiness). An 
   old drunk couple spot him through his store window that night and 
   make fun of his artwork, so he follows them back to their apartment 
   and bashes them both over the head until they are dead. Malcolm then 
   sits in their rocking chair, as we are treated to another one of his 
   POV shots when we see the camera moving up and down looking at the 
   couple's bloody corpses while Malcolm rocks in the chair. When he 
   exits the apartment building, a hooker notices his bloody hand and 
   takes him back to her apartment to patch it up. Malcolm uses one of 
   her kitchen knives to stab her in the throat and, while she is still 
   alive holding her throat, he puts her in the bathtub and turns on the 
   shower, watching her die as her blood goes down the drain (Hitchcock 
   this ain't!). We then see Malcolm reading a newspaper, where an 
   obviously pasted-on headline reads POLICE BAFFLED. &quot;EYE&quot; 
   KILLER SLAYS 14TH. He is then visited by his longtime ex-lover Anna 
   (Kelley Swartz), who calls him &quot;Mal&quot; and has traveled from 
   some expensive place other than NYC (she is loaded with money) to see 
   how he is doing. It seems the last two years they lived together was 
   a living hell for her and she accuses Mal of still living in a 
   fantasy world. She left NYC after they broke up and now thinks Mal is 
   incurable. Malcolm doesn't disagree and even says this about himself: 
   &quot;Because I am twisted. Because I want to find out something. 
   Because I am sick!&quot; He also tells Anna, &quot;I didn't just lose 
   an eye. Something happened.&quot; Anna offers to help Malcolm with 
   the best doctors money can buy, but he goes on a long rant about his 
   past and how he sold his first painting and was able to treat Anna to 
   dinner for the first time with his own money, all the while holding a 
   pair of human eyes encased in lucite. Anna becomes frightened and 
   leaves, while Malcolm stares into the nothingness that his life has 
   become. We then see a TV reporter interviewing people on the street 
   while waiting for Malcolm's 13th victim (who only had one of her eyes 
   removed) to be brought out of a funeral home in a casket and put in a 
   hearse. Malcolm is in the crowd, while the reporter asks the 
   wisecracking detective (Gordon Ramon) in charge of the case if there 
   have been any developments. The detective replies, &quot;Yeah, there 
   have been developments. If you want to call victim #14 a development. 
   There's nothing obvious about this guy. Nothing sticks out (Really?). 
   Let's hope we get him before he makes it #15.&quot; When the 
   detective calls the killer a &quot;pervert&quot;, Malcolm flashes 
   back to when he killed victim #13 on a building rooftop while she was 
   hanging laundry. He kills her and only gets the chance to remove one 
   of her eyes as he hears footsteps coming up the stairs. He beats a 
   hasty retreat, not forgetting that he didn't have the time to remove 
   her other eye. After listening to the reporter for a short time, 
   Malcolm leaves and walks down the street, where an old woman in a 
   chair (she is quite the sight) looks at him and repeatedly says, 
   &quot;I know who did it!&quot; Malcolm becomes freaked-out and begins 
   running through the streets (giving us a great glimpse of early-70's 
   NYC) until he happens upon a beautiful blonde woman brushing her 
   hair. Malcolm follows her to a modeling agency on the 9th floor of a 
   highrise building, where he cracks open the door and watches her doff 
   her top while showing the agent her photo portfolio (We don't get to 
   see her her topless. As a matter of fact, there is absolutely no 
   nudity in this film. Very weird.). Both Malcolm and the blonde woman 
   wait for the elevator for what seems like an eternity (And Malcolm 
   couldn't make it any more obvious that he is following her since he 
   is standing about ten paces to the side of the elevator door!). Once 
   they get out of the elevator, the blonde woman runs to her boyfriend 
   (pimp?) and she points out Malcolm to him, but they end up just 
   driving away. Malcolm decides to sneak into the modeling agency to 
   get the blonde woman's address, which he does, but he is caught by 
   the receptionist who returns back from lunch (She flips open his 
   eyepatch and Malcolm says, &quot;Pretty, isn't it?&quot;). Malcolm 
   strangles her with her own huge chain necklace (we see her feet off 
   the floor) and gouges out both her eyes with a special spoon he keeps 
   in its own black velvet pouch (!), making her victim #15, while 
   saying, &quot;I'm sorry! You'll never have to worry again!&quot;. He 
   brings her eyeballs home and puts them in the container in his 
   freezer. Malcolm really begins to lose it and fantasizes about 
   walking the empty streets of NYC, ending up at the huge locked doors 
   of St. Patrick's Cathedral. Someone leaves a note under Malcolm's 
   door, it saying that his artwork is unique and hopes that they can 
   meet. It is signed simply &quot;A Friend&quot;. Malcolm drives to a 
   graveyard and digs up victim #13 and removes the eye he failed to get 
   when he killed her (Now that's dedication!). The detective is waiting 
   there for him and catches him in the act. All Malcolm can say is, 
   &quot;I'm twisted!&quot; to which the detective replies, &quot;You've 
   twisted me into a big fat promotion!&quot; Somehow (I'm still not 
   sure how he did it) Malcolm manages to get the drop on the detective 
   (who is holding a gun) and beats him to death with his shovel. 
   Malcolm meets the note-writer, who turns out to be a young long 
   black-haired female named Gigi (Mary Jane Early) and she wants 
   Malcolm to teach her his<A HREF="headless_eyes_1971_dvd.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/headless eyes dvd front8c small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="213" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   &quot;technique&quot;. Malcolm is reluctant until Gigi tells him that 
   she hangs out by a lighthouse under the George Washington Bridge 
   because she doesn't get along with most people. Malcolm agrees to 
   meet her there the next morning and they strike up a friendship 
   because Malcolm finds her eyes &quot;different&quot;. He has finally 
   found a like-minded soul and she hands him an invite to an art 
   gallery showing (it's hand-drawn and quite lousy) which he says he 
   will meet her there on Saturday. But first, Malcolm follows the 
   blonde model (who turns out to be a drug mule) and traps her in a 
   freezer at a meat packing plant. He strangles her, removes her eyes 
   and puts them in his pocket, only to discover that the freezer has 
   locked behind him and he is trapped. When the workers open the 
   freezer door the next day, they discover Malcolm frozen stiff (He has 
   also written something on the freezer door in blood which contains 
   his name, but I couldn't quite make the rest of it out, even when 
   going through the scene frame-by-frame on the DVD.), while we hear 
   Malcolm's voice saying over-and-over, &quot;I'm not finished!&quot; 
   THE END.&nbsp; I know I should really despise this film because of 
   the lack of nudity (which is strange since Henri Pachard produced 
   it), the loose ends (What happens to Gigi and what is in that white 
   paper bag she is always carrying?) and all the technical faults, but 
   it is just so damn weird, I just can't help myself in loving it. It 
   is about as sleazy as a film can get (and it did obtain a theatrical 
   release, no matter what the retro Wizard Video &quot;Too Gory For The 
   Silver Screen&quot; promo says, which is included on the DVD and 
   brings back many memories) and Bo Brundin is just as crazy as any 
   actor can get portraying Malcolm. Kent Bateman has gone on record 
   saying that Henri Pachard wanted more blood and gore in the movie and 
   filmed some more bloody footage after the film was finished (the 
   blood flowing over the eyeball looks like one of those inserts) and 
   Bateman didn't know a thing about it until he saw a showing of the 
   film in a theater. Even with the extra footage, the film only runs 78 
   minutes, so it doesn't overstay its welcome. It is full of gory 
   eyeball removal scenes and they are not professionally done, but 
   somehow they fit in perfectly with the rest of the film. It was 
   originally released on VHS by <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Wizard Video">Wizard
    Video</A> in that distinctive artwork (Which Charles Band also used 
   in the VHS release of his awful film <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Killer Eye">THE
    KILLER EYE</A></B> - 1998) and then released on <A HREF="headless_eyes_1971_dvd.htm">DVD</A> 
   by Charles Band as part of his &quot;<A HREF="full_moons_grindhouse_collection_ad.htm">Full
    Moon's Grindhouse Collection</A>&quot; (I would advise you to watch 
   Band's skippable 10 minute intro before viewing the film because it 
   is damn funny and informative at the same time.). I have read where a 
   lot of people complain that it is the same fullscreen VHS transfer as 
   the one on Wizard Video (which was, and still is, owned by Band), but 
   since I own both of them, I can tell you that the DVD is much clearer 
   and the sound is much better. Hell, it only cost me ten bucks, so I 
   wasn't demanding perfection (and I didn't get it), but the transfer 
   (taken from a 16mm print) suits this grimy film just fine. Maybe 
   someday we will see a clear widescreen transfer of this film on disc 
   (but I wouldn't wait for it), but until then, this DVD will do. A <A HREF="http://www.fullmoondirect.com">Full

    A few years later, we see that Alex is a troubled teen, as he walks 
   in a park to collect his thoughts. He sees a man playing chess and he 
   invites Alex to partake in a game. Alex says he hates chess, but he 
   plays a game anyway and loses quickly. The man's name is Harry 
   Jelenik (Erick Kastel; <B><A HREF="offspring_2009.htm">OFFSPRING</A></B> 
   - 2009) and he shakes Alex's hand, telling Alex that he will teach 
   him the finer points of the game. Before they can play another game, 
   Alex suffers from what seems to be a huge migraine headache and 
   excuses himself. Alex doesn't know it (yet), but every time he has 
   one of these &quot;headaches&quot;, something bad happens and someone 
   dies bloodily. Alex is housesitting for an aquaintence and when his 
   best friend, Jason (Paul Sparks; <B><A HREF="midnight_special_2015.htm">MIDNIGHT
    SPECIAL</A></B> - 2015), pays him a visit, he finds Alex on the 
   floor, passed out after suffering from one of his headaches. Jason 
   calls an ambulance and Alex is taken to the hospital, where Dr. Ira 
   Gold (William Atherton; <B><A HREF="girl_next_door_2007.htm">THE GIRL 
   NEXT DOOR</A></B> - 2007) tells his associate, Dr. Denise Bell (Dee 
   Wallace Stone; <B><A HREF="cujo_1983.htm">CUJO</A></B> - 1983), that 
   Alex uses more of his frontal lobe for cognitive activity than anyone 
   who has ever been charted. He tells Dr. Bell not to release Alex, 
   even though Dr. Bell&nbsp; says that medically, he's fine. Dr. Gold 
   is more interested in Alex's abilities than his medical condition, 
   telling Dr. Bell, &quot;His chart alone is worth tens of thousands in 
   study grants.&quot; When Dr. Bell tells him she has no other choice 
   but to release Alex, Dr. Gold half-jokingly says, &quot;I suppose a post-mortem
    autopsy is out of the question?&quot;, which Dr. Bell does not find 
   funny. Dr. Gold is adamant on keeping Alex in the hospital and runs 
   more tests on him, but they aren't medical tests, they're to see how 
   intelligent Alex is. It turns out that Alex is a few steps above a 
   genius and he also has super-hearing, telling Dr. Bell he heard Dr. 
   Gold's &quot;post-mortem&quot; remark and all this new intelligence 
   is something he doesn't want. Dr. Bell sends Alex to psychiatrist Dr. 
   Karen Murphy (Olivia Hussy; <B><A HREF="black_christmas_1974.htm">BLACK

    Alex then goes to Harry's apartment to play some chess, admires 
   Harry's paintings (Harry paints live nude women and places them in 
   nightmarish scenes) and notices him popping some prescription pills. 
   Alex asks what the medication is and Harry says his doctor told him 
   he needs it to &quot;put some hair on my chest.&quot; Harry is 
   obviously lying, but why? We then see Dr. Gold in his office late at 
   night, when he is attacked and killed by some creature with very 
   sharp claws. Alex then goes to Jason's home, looks into a window and 
   spies on Jason and his girlfriend, Stacy (Pollyanna McIntosh; <B><A HREF="let_us_prey_2014.htm">LET
    US PREY</A></B> - 2014), making love. He then suddenly has one of 
   his attacks and runs back to the home he is housesitting, where he 
   plays some heavy metal music to drown-out the thoughts he is having, 
   while news on TV reports of Dr. Gold's mutilation murder. Alex lies 
   down in bed and stares at the ceiling, not noticing a strange mist 
   swirling under his closed bedroom door. What does this mean?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    At one of his sessions, Alex asks Dr. Murphy to pick out a book from 
   her library, which she does. Alex scans the book quickly by flipping 
   through the pages and asks her to pick out a page. When Alex quotes 
   the page verbatim, Dr. Murphy is quite shocked, but now she knows 
   what she is dealing with. Alex is drawn to his new friend Harry like 
   a moth to a flame, but is Harry really his friend? That night, Alex 
   is attacked by the clawed creature, but escapes. The same can't be 
   said of Sammy (Patrick Wang) and Lloyd (James Spruill), two park 
   chess players who don't like Alex (They confronted Alex earlier in 
   the day, telling him that he must play both of them before he can 
   play Harry again), as they are attacked and killed by the creature in 
   a public bathroom. The next day, Alex tells Dr. Murphy about being 
   attacked by the creature and shows her the claw marks on his chest 
   and stomach as proof, but she believes that Alex's wounds are 
   self-inflicted. They then hear about Sammy and Lloyd's murders on the 
   radio and Alex says, &quot;I killed them!&quot; before running out of 
   Dr. Murphy's office. Alex goes to Harry's apartment, where Harry is 
   drunk and grieving over Sammy and Lloyd's deaths, saying he can't 
   believe a &quot;beast&quot; mutilated both of them. Harry and Alex 
   play a game of chess, where Alex wins quite quickly. It's Harry's 
   first loss in over three years and demands that Alex plays another 
   game. Alex has another one of his attacks, only this time he sees his 
   father sign over the legal rights to Alex and his brother to the 
   State. The father has only one condition and before we can hear what 
   it is, Alex wakes up and bolts from Harry's apartment. Alex goes to 
   Jason's house and tells him and Stacy what is happening to him. He 
   says, &quot;Things from Hell are after me. I know that sounds.. that 
   sounds whatever, but...I can't call the doctors because they'll put 
   me in a straight-jacket. I can't...I can't sleep because there's a 
   fucking monster in my closet. And I have this headache because I know 
   things. I know a million things that I have no idea how I know them. 
   I'm mastering the game of chess; I'm reading Cervantes; I know these 
   things!&quot; He then tells them, &quot;I know you fucked an hour 
   ago&quot; and then says to Jason, &quot;Your brother doesn't know 
   that you talked your father into changing his will.&quot; He then 
   turns to Stacy and says, &quot;You say that you're true to Jason, but 
   when you wanted a raise at work, you flashed your supervisor your 
   tits!&quot; Stacy tells Jason that it isn't true, but Alex says it is 
   and she even let her supervisor feel her up. Jason tells Alex to 
   leave his house, so Alex gets up and leaves, but not before saying, 
   &quot;Yeah, I didn't think you could help me.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>

   You can see his transformation as soon as he shakes hands with Harry. 
   Denham would later direct and write the unnerving horror films <B><A HREF="home_movie_2008.htm">HOME
    MOVIE</A></B> (2008; produced by Andrew van den Houten.) and <B><A HREF="preservation_2014.htm">PRESERVATION</A></B> 
   (2014), both worth seeking out. This film, written by Steve Klausner 
   and William M. Miller (who was also this film's cinematographer), is 
   like a huge jigsaw puzzle and the pieces we are given throughout 
   don't seem to fit anywhere, but when we get to the film's conclusion, 
   we realize that the pieces fit perfectly. The hectic, fast-paced 
   editing is a perfectly effective realization of what is going on in 
   Alex's brain. Anyone who has suffered through a fever dream while 
   running a high body temperature will sympathize with Alex, as his 
   brain is working overtime in overdrive., where nothing seems to make 
   much sense, but that's because Harry has awoken something long 
   dormant in Alex that he hasn't experienced since he and Harry were 
   children. The film keeps the viewer off-balance and mystified, 
   questioning what is going on, but if you give this film your full 
   attention (turn off your phone, quit texting and stop surfing the 
   Internet), you will be able to solve the mystery before the film's 
   final reveal. All the clues are there, some overt and some cleverly 
   disguised, making this film a good bet for both horror and mystery 
   fans. While not extremely bloody or gory, the killings are very well 
   done, especially Sammy &amp; Lloyd's murders in the public restroom, 
   which is an excellent primer on how to build suspense. The film also 
   has more than its share of female nudity, especially by Jason's 
   girlfriend Stacy and a couple of Harry's female models.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    I originally viewed this film on pay cable station Showtime early in 
   2006 and instantly regretted not recording it, as it had a strange 
   effect on me, quite unlike most films I watch. It was never aired 
   again, so I basically forgot about it, that is until I discovered it 
   streaming on Amazon Prime in a &quot;Director's Cut&quot;. I can't 
   tell you how it differs from the original edit, but I will tell you 
   it affected me the same way as when I originally watched it in 2006. 
   Isn't that what all good films should do? Many attempt it, but few 
   succeed, so put this film on your must-see list. Just don't forget to 
   give it your full attention and enjoy this engrossing movie with a 
   perfect title. Also featuring Paula Kelly, David Austin, Mercedes 
   Renard and Quinn Lujan &amp; Daniel Manche as Young Alex &amp; Young 
   Harry. <B>Rated R</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

    Industrialist Robert Caine (Kirk Douglas; <B><A HREF="fury_1978.htm">THE
    FURY</A></B> - 1978) is about to realize his dream of building the 
   world's largest nuclear power plant in the Middle East's Holy Land to 
   combat the world's energy crisis. With the approval of the country's 
   Prime Minister (Ivo Garrani; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#AtomAgeVampire1960">ATOM
    AGE VAMPIRE</A></B> - 1960), Robert brings the Press on a tour of 
   the land on which he plans to build the plant. A female photographer, 
   Sara Golan (Agostina Belli; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightOfThe Devils72">NIGHT
    OF THE DEVILS</A></B> - 1972), catches Robert's eye and he shows her 
   a cave where the word <B>&quot;<FONT COLOR="MAROON">IESVS</FONT>&quot;</B> 
   is carved into a boulder. Robert tells her that the word actually 
   says <B>&quot;<FONT COLOR="MAROON">JESUS</FONT>&quot;</B>, since in 
   ancient times this country's language didn't contain the letter 
   &quot;J&quot;. Sara is fully aware of this and says that Robert may 
   have found the &quot;Cave of Prophecies&quot;, so she takes a photo 
   of him standing next to the boulder, a photo which will haunt Robert 
   for the rest of his life. It will also mean the death of anyone 
   important enough to stop the building of the nuclear power plant. At 
   a party at Robert's house for the Prime Minister, where a throng of 
   people are protesting the building of the plant (They chant, 
   &quot;What do our children want to be when they get older?&quot; 
   &quot;Alive!&quot;), a strange Arab man (Massimo Foschi; <B><A HREF="jungle_holocaust_1976.htm">JUNGLE</A> <A HREF="jungle_holocaust_1976_code_red_blu-ray.htm">HOLOCAUST</A></B>

   but Robert's son, Angel (Simon Ward; <B><A HREF="frankenstein_must_be_destroyed_1969.htm">FRANKENSTEIN
    MUST BE DESTROYED</A></B> - 1969), wrestles with the man and 
   accidentally kills his mother, Eva (Virginia McKenna; De Martino's <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BloodLink1983">BLOOD
    LINK</A></B> - 1983), by ripping open her stomach with the knife. It

   find out why as the film progresses.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At Eva's funeral, Robert notices that Angel doesn't seem sad at all 
   and asks him why. Angel replies that his mother always treated him 
   cruelly and doesn't understand why. Robert tells him that he once had 
   a twin brother, but he died during childbirth and Eva was never the 
   same after that. Robert doesn't tell Angel the reason why, something 
   else we will discover as the film progresses. At the cemetery, Sara 
   pays Robert a visit and hands him the photo she took of him in the 
   Cave of Prophecies, but instead of him posing in front of the word <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">IESVS</FONT></B>,
    he stands in front of a carving of the &quot;Dragon of the 
   Apocalypse&quot;, a seven-headed creature which bears a remarkable 
   likeness to the nuclear power plant he intends to build (Robert can 
   no longer go to the cave because he blew it up to clear the grounds 
   for construction of the power plant). Angel begins to take an 
   interest in the power plant's construction, much to Robert's 
   surprise, but his interest is constructive and informative, which 
   pleases his father. Angel tells Robert that the Prime Minister has 
   been voted out of office and the new Prime Minister, Harbin (Spyros 
   Focas; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#FlaviaTheHeretic74">FLAVIA THE HERETIC</A></B> 
   - 1974), is dead set against the power plant being built. Robert 
   flies out to talk to him, but Harbin says the plant will never see 
   construction, not just on moral grounds, but for religious reasons, 
   too, handing Robert a report on the reason why he is rejecting the 
   power plant. One of the reason in the report states that the ten 
   safety features in the plant are not good enough and must be studied 
   to verifiy they will never fail, so Robert has his head computer guy, 
   Professor Griffith (Anthony Quayle; <B><A HREF="study_in_terror_1965.htm">A
    STUDY IN TERROR</A></B> - 1965), enter all the data into the 
   computer to see if Harbin is correct. The computer 
   &quot;malfunctions&quot;, spitting out the code <B>&quot;<FONT COLOR="NAVY">2v231</FONT>&quot;</B> 
   (2 to the square root of 231) and Robert tells Griffith to figure it out.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While on a plane ride, a priest named Father Charrier (Romolo Valli; <B><A HREF="barbarella_1968.htm">BARBARELLA</A></B> 
   - 1968) notices Robert looking at the computer code and he laughs, 
   telling Robert he saw the code in reverse, which reads <B>&quot;<FONT COLOR="MAROON">IESVS</FONT>&quot;</B>.
    Robert, who is an Agnostic, goes to Father Charrier's home and 
   learns that the Devil's mark is Jesus' name in reverse, as a matter 
   of fact, everything the Devil does is the reverse of what Jesus does 
   (Example: Instead of Jesus' 12 Disciples, the Devil has 21. And so 
   on.). Charrier schools Robert in the ways of the Bible, showing him 
   ancient drawings of the Dragon of the Apocalypse and the signs of the 
   Antichrist, which is said to have been born or will be born in the 
   latter half of the 20th Century. &quot;The Antichrist will be the 
   second son&quot;, says Charrier. Even though Robert is a 
   non-believer, some of what Charrier says seems to hit a nerve and 
   they become fast friends. Robert and Sara start a relationship, which 
   soon becomes sexually intimate (She reveals that she works for 
   Harbin). Angel tells Robert that Harbin is making a surprise visit to 
   Geneva, Switzerland to announce his plans to not build the power 
   plant on his country's land. Robert seems defeated, but Angel tells 
   him that everything will work out, not to worry, the plant will be 
   built. As everyone watches live television footage of Harbin stepping 
   off the plane in Geveva, a large gust of mysterious wind blows 
   through the airport and Harbin has the back of his head sliced off by 
   the spinning blade of a helicopter, killing him instantly (it's quite 
   the sight!). Now back in business, Robert doubles his efforts, with 
   Angel's help, to build the power plant in the Holy Land, but when 
   Sara announces she is pregnant and it will be a boy, Robert takes 
   Father Charrier's words to heart, thinking that the baby boy may be 
   the Antichrist, since it will be his second son (he's not really 
   thinking this out, is he?). Robert wants Sara to talk to Father 
   Charrier, but she will not enter a church, which makes Robert even 
   more suspicious. Robert wants Sara to abort the baby, but she won't, 
   leaving him and going to live with Angel secretly, behind Robert's 
   back (Angel seems happy the baby is being born).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Professor Griffith figures out that the mysterious computer code is 
   actually a number to a medical file of one of the company's 
   employees. Griffith calls up Robert and says, &quot;Caine, you have 
   generated something that is not human!&quot;, telling him to meet him 
   in the computer room immediately. While Robert is going there, we see 
   the computer room going bonkers, which results in Griffith being cut 
   in half by a rapidly falling glass door. Robert checks out the 
   computer room for clues to Griffith's mysterious phone call and 
   discovers a secret message Griffith put into the computer, which says 
   that Angel is not human. Robert finally figures out that Angel is the 
   Antichrist, telling Father Charrier that Angel was actually his 
   second son. It turns out that Angel's umbilical cord strangled his 
   twin brother and Eva believed it was done on purpose by Angel, which 
   is why she never treated him like a son. Robert goes to confront 
   Angel, but before he does, he hands Charrier a letter, saying if he 
   doesn't return, to deliver it to Geneva, it's his letter rejecting 
   the building of the power plant. Robert then confronts Angel and he 
   doesn't deny anything, telling his father that he looks forward to 
   the end of the world in the near future and that he will kill his new 
   baby boy at &quot;his convenience.&quot; Robert tries to strangle 
   Angel, but some guards pull him off and commit him to an insane 
   asylum, the same place where the strange Arab man was placed when he 
   tried to kill Robert. The Arab man then kidnaps Robert, who is in a 
   strait-jacket, and rolls him into a padded cell, where all the other 
   crazy patients are waiting to kill him. They pile on Robert and begin 
   biting him, but Robert escapes from his strait-jacket and kills the 
   Arab man by bashing his head in with a piece of the gurney (very 
   bloody, but quick). At the same time, Father Charrier hops on a small 
   plane headed for Geneva, pretending to be Robert Caine, but the plane 
   refuses to leave the ground, hitting a wall and exploding, killing 
   everyone on board. Robert escapes from the asylum and goes to the 
   nursery ward of a hospital where Sara delivered her baby. Just as a 
   nurse is about to give all the baby's in the ward some poison (but 
   not on purpose), Sara takes her baby from the crib and saves him, 
   while all the other babies die in front of her and Robert. We then 
   see Angel, the new head of the company, which now has 21 board 
   members (instead of the usual twelve) praising his dead father (he 
   mistakenly believes he died in the plane crash) and saying the 
   nuclear power plant will complete construction and go into operation 
   on his 33rd birthday. The open ending finds Robert, Sara and their 
   baby living in exile, waiting for the world to end. Is that not the 
   way you remember this film ending? Well there's a reason for that

   a well-respected surgeon at a clinic, thanks to a new anesthetic he 
   invented which drastically lowers the heart rate and slows down the 
   decomposition of human organs, allowing him to work longer on 
   patients on the operating table without them waking up too soon and 
   dying from pain or shock (Which actually happened back then, due to 
   the unreliability of chloroform, the only anesthesia in use back in 
   the late-19th Century. Every patient reacted differently to it, many 
   waking up mid-surgery and dying, because no patient should wake up 
   seeing a surgeon with his hands wrist-deep in their bodies!). But 
   Professor Hichcock has another use for his anesthetic, one more sick 
   and twisted than anyone in society could accept. Since he can only 
   get sexually aroused with cadavers, his wife, Margaretha (Maria 
   Teresa Vianello, as &quot;Teresa Fitzgerald&quot;; <B><A HREF="giants_of_thessaly_1960.htm">THE

   woman, allows her husband to inject her with the anesthetic, whereby 
   her body goes into a death-like state while Bernard goes to town on 
   her. They even have their own special room in Bernard's rather large 
   Victorian mansion to do the deed. It's a secret only he, Margaretha 
   and housekeeper Martha (Harriet White Medin; <B><A HREF="#BloodBlackLace1964">BLOOD

   Bernard gets greedy, wanting more time with his wife's lifeless body, 
   so he doubles the dose of the anesthesia, which results in Margaretha 
   dying instantly in front of him. After her funeral, where 
   Margaretha's coffin is placed in the unkempt family crypt (we see a 
   broken casket where a human skull is sticking out!), Bernard becomes 
   inconsolable and can no longer live in his mansion due to the 
   memories it holds, so he quits the clinic and moves out of London, 
   leaving the mansion in the care of Martha. Before he leaves, he asks 
   Martha if she has seen Margaretha's black cat Jezebel, but Martha 
   says she hasn't seen it since his wife's unfortunate death. What they

    Twelve years pass and Bernard returns to London and his mansion with 
   a new wife, Cynthia (Barbara Steele; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LongHairDeath1964">THE
    LONG HAIR OF DEATH</A></B> - 1964).&nbsp; As soon as Cynthia steps 
   into the mansion, she is at unease. It could be all the portraits of 
   Margaretha that hang on many of the walls or the ear-piercing woman's 
   scream that she hears. Martha then enters the room with Jezebel in 
   her arms and tells Bernard and Cynthia that the screams they just 
   heard came from her sister. She is quite mad and she is committing 
   her to an asylum tomorrow morning. We can see that Bernard and 
   Cynthia haven't consummated their marriage yet (if you know what I 
   mean), as they are sleeping in separate bedrooms. It is also quite 
   obvious that Cynthia has no idea what her husband's sexual needs 
   involve, as she doesn't seem to be the type of woman that would be 
   willing to be put in a cadaver-like state so Bernard can get his jollies.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That night, during a raging thunderstorm, Cynthia looks out her 
   bedroom window and sees a woman in white walking towards the family 
   crypt. Is it possible that Margaretha is alive, a ghost or is it 
   something with a more rational explanation? The next morning Cynthia 
   tells her husband that she wants to move out of the house, but 
   Bernard tells her she is just nervous about living in a new house and 
   to give it time and she will get over it. Bernard is now back working 
   at the clinic as a surgeon and before he leaves, he tells Cynthia 
   that they have been invited to a concert tonight and to be ready by 
   8:00 p.m. At the end of the concert, Bernard is called to the clinic 
   for an emergency, so he has his assistant, Dr. Kurt Lowe (Silvano 
   Tranquilli, as &quot;Montgomery Glenn; <B><A HREF="castle_of_blood_1964.htm">CASTLE
    OF BLOOD</A></B> - 1964) accompany Cynthia back to the mansion and 
   then immediately join him at the clinic. On the ride to the mansion, 
   Kurt and Cynthia get to know each other better and there is even a 
   little flirtation going on. At the clinic, the woman Bernard is 
   performing surgery on dies on the operating table and there are 
   murmurs from the staff that the &quot;old man&quot; is losing his 
   touch. Kurt tells Bernard that the patient would have probably lived 
   if he used the anesthesia he invented on her, but Bernard says no, he 
   will never use it again until it is perfected. As the dead female 
   patient is being wheeled away, Bernard looks at her and his eyes tell 
   us it's the kind of look a man gives when he is about to get lucky. 
   Will he be able to control his perverse desires? Don't count on it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Bernard goes home, pours himself a couple of stiff drinks (The only 
   kind he enjoys!) and downs them quickly, not knowing that Cynthia is 
   passed out upstairs on the floor after discovering a human skull on 
   her pillow when she turned down the covers. When she wakes up, she 
   discovers that the skull is now missing. Before she can tells Bernard 
   what she saw, he is no longer in the mansion. He sneaked out to visit 
   the clinic at closing time. As he enters the morgue and is about to 
   get busy with the female cadaver, he is interrupted by the clinic's 
   janitor, who asks Bernard if he needs help in any way, Bernard beats 
   a hasty retreat out of the clinic and goes home (giving &quot;blue 
   balls&quot; a whole new meaning!). The next morning, Cynthia tells 
   Martha to keep her sister locked in her room because she heard 
   someone at her bedroom door last night, but Martha says it couldn't 
   have been her sister because she took her to the asylum the day 
   before. If it wasn't Martha's sister, then who was it? Cynthia tells 
   Bernard that she saw a woman walking down the hallway last night, but 
   she couldn't see her face because she was watching in fear through 
   her bedroom door's keyhole (She doesn't tell him about finding the 
   human skull in her bed, however.). What she is certain of is that the 
   woman was wearing exactly the same white slippers that Margaretha 
   wears in the painting that Bernard has in his bedroom. Bernard 
   reminds Cynthia that when he first met her, she wasn't well. The 
   shock of her father's sudden death left her in a highly nervous 
   condition. He tells her that she seems to be getting over it, but 
   warns her not to allow her imagination to get the best of her (It 
   seems more like a threat than a suggestion). Cynthia is adamant, 
   saying that she really saw it and that she waited up all night to 
   tell him, but he never came home. Bernard lies to her, saying he was 
   working late at the clinic and he got home extremely late. Cynthia 
   tells Bernard that she knows he adored Margaretha, but paintings of 
   her are in nearly every room, including his bedroom, and they make 
   her feel uncomfortable, as if Margaretha's eyes are watching her 
   every move. Bernard ignores her, telling Cynthia that he must leave, 
   but he reminds her that when he is not home, she is never to enter 
   his bedroom (There's also a door in the mansion that is always kept 
   locked, Martha telling Cynthia that even she doesn't have the key). 
   When Bernard leaves, Cynthia sees Martha exiting out a secret door 
   behind a full-length mirror in the hallway. Before she can see what 
   is behind that door, Kurt pays the mansion a visit to talk to 
   Bernard, but Cynthia tells him her husband is not at home. Kurt can 
   see something is troubling Cynthia and asks her what is wrong.&nbsp; 
   &quot;Do you believe in ghosts?&quot; asks Cynthia and when Kurt says 
   no, she says, &quot;Neither do I, but ever since I have been in this 
   house, it's been a constant fear to me. I'm beginning to believe in 
   them.&quot; She tells Kurt about the woman in white that seems to be 
   following her, but Kurt asks if she is certain or did she image it? 
   &quot;I knew you wouldn't believe me!&quot; says Cynthia and then 
   asks Kurt if he thinks Bernard is normal? &quot;As much a any man of 
   genius&quot; says Kurt, wondering why she asked that question. 
   &quot;Oh, nothing, just an idea&quot; says Cynthia. Kurt says he must 
   go back to the clinic, but he tells Cynthia if she needs help with 
   anything, don't hesitate to let him know. By the look in both their 
   eyes, it is easy to see they are falling for each other, but will 
   they act upon it? After dinner, Bernard and Cynthia are sitting in 
   the Study ignoring each other when Bernard rises and says he must go 
   to the clinic, as he has important work to do. Cynthia complains and 
   tells Bernard he has changed and accuses him of not caring about her 
   anymore. She says it was a mistake for her to move into this mansion 
   and, once again, Bernard ignores her, asking Cynthia if she wants 
   Martha to sleep upstairs tonight. Cynthia says no, she would prefer 
   to be alone and tells Bernard to hurry back home; she'll stay awake 
   for him. Bernard says he will probably be very late, but he will look 
   in on hr to say goodnight (Stop, you're making me horny!&quot; is 
   what no one would say in this situation, as Bernard makes it clear to 
   Cynthia that he doesn't consider her sexually attractive. Barbara 
   Steele? I'd give up screwing cadavers for her!). It's quite obvious 
   that Bernard would rather spend time with a corpse than be with her 
   and by the look on Cynthia's face, it tells us she now knows Bernard 
   is not a &quot;normal&quot; loving husband, but she doesn't know the 
   reason why. Martha overhears the conversation and realizes that 
   Bernard is having those sexual urges again.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Bernard enters the morgue and begins fondling the female cadaver (He 
   pulls the sheet of the naked corpse's body and while we don't see 
   anything, his eyes tell us how turned-on he is). Once again, he is 
   interrupted by one of the staff, this time by Dr. Lang (Spencer 
   Williams), who sees Bernard standing over a naked cadaver, but 
   Bernard is quick on his feet, telling Dr. Lang he was checking the 
   body's state of coagulation. Dr. Lang is confused and somewhat 
   suspicious, but Bernard makes a quick retreat from the morgue. This 
   bit of business will eventually lead to Professor Bernard Hichcock's 
   downfall, but he doesn't know it...yet.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Cynthia opens the secret mirror door and begins exploring. It leads 
   her to the mansion's dungeon, where she spots he human skull sitting 
   on a table. She also spots Martha taking care of an unseen woman in 
   white (she is sitting with her back to us) and Cynthia tells Bernard 
   Martha was lying. Her sister is being kept in a room in the basement. 
   Bernard asks if she actually saw the woman, which Cynthia finds to be 
   a strange question to ask. Cynthia then asks Bernard what's behind 
   the locked door she is not allowed to open and he tells her it's his 
   old laboratory and he wishes it to remain locked. She begs Bernard to 
   leave the house immediately because he has changed so much for the 
   worse since they have been here. Bernard tells her that he left this 
   house once and he bitterly regrets having done so and he shall not 
   leave it again, briskly telling Cynthia goodnight.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Bernard then hears the piano playing a tune that Margaretha use to 
   play when she was alive, so he races to the balcony and sees a woman 
   in white playing the piano. When he runs downstairs, all he sees is 
   Jezebel sitting on top of the piano. Bernard believes Margaretha has 
   returned from the dead, as the woman in white haunts his every waking 
   moment. He then finds Cynthia passed out next to the family crypt in 
   a raging thunderstorm. He brings her unconscious body to his old 
   &quot;laboratory&quot;, which is actually the special room where he 
   and Margaretha use to play their perverse sexual games. When Cynthia 
   wakes up, she sees Bernard with a horribly deformed face (it's quite 
   a shocking sight, as his face pulsates with early-in-the-game bladder 
   effects) and she faints once again. At the clinic, Kurt notices some 
   scratches on Bernard's neck and he tells Kurt that Jezebel scratched 
   him. Kurt doesn't believe him because they look like fingernail 
   scratches, not cat scratches. Bernard then &quot;confesses&quot; to 
   Kurt that Cynthia scratched him, telling him his wife is not well and 
   she believes Margaretha is haunting her. Kurt is not buying it, but 
   he plays stupid. We then see Cynthia at the mansion under the control 
   of Bernard, who tells her he is going to make her &quot;better&quot; 
   and then hands her a glass of milk, telling her to drink it. Cynthia 
   pretends to drink it (she actually pours it into a potted plant) and 
   she brings the glass to Kurt at the clinic to examine and find out 
   what drug Bernard tried to slip her.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It is at this time we have to ask ourselves if Bernard sexually 
   assaulted Cynthia when he brought her to his dead wife's 
   &quot;playroom.&quot; It would have been the perfect time to slip her 
   his anesthetic and then go to town on her body. At this time, it is 
   plain to see that Bernard has gone quite mad, He give Martha some 
   time off, telling her to leave the mansion and not to come back until 
   he calls for her. When Kurt discovers that the glass of milk 
   contained enough sleeping pills to kill Cynthia, he rushes to the 
   mansion, but will he arrive too late? Cynthia then wakes up in a 
   sealed coffin in the family crypt, but she is able to rock the coffin 
   off its base, breaking it and freeing her. She is then chase by the 
   woman in white, but is it really Margaretha? The answer may surprise 
   you (it did me!). The film concludes with the mansion burning to the 
   ground, but who, if anyone, will survive?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   introduced into the plot (giving the first ten minutes, which takes 
   place at a graveyard with no dialogue, a whole new meaning, since it 
   makes no sense when you first see it. Rather than trying to explain 
   it, it is best if you see it for yourself.). While we see absolutely 
   no sexual defilements of human corpses, it's quite obvious that 
   Bernard is a necrophiliac, thanks to Robert Flemyng's not-so-subtle 
   looks at cadavers. It's by no means cartoonish, but it leaves no 
   doubts in your mind what he is really after. Since the subject matter 
   was considered off-limits, even in Italian genre<!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/horrible dr. hichcock italy poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="311" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"> 
   films (and that is saying quite a lot!), Freda and Gastaldi have to 
   come up with ways to imply it and Flemyng nails it (pardon the pun) 
   just by his facial twitches and eye movements alone (When Flemyng 
   discovered that his character was a necrophiliac, he tried to quit, 
   but Freda talked him out of it, assuring him it would be done 
   &quot;tastefully.&quot;). The film was shot in 14 days, but it 
   doesn't look or feel like a rushed quickie, thanks to &quot;Donald 
   Green's&quot; (actually Raffaele Masciocchi; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#DeathFourposter1964">DEATH

   Hichcock&quot;, a relative of Bernard's. Both films were made during 
   the '60s &quot;pseudonym craze&quot;, in which audiences were made to 
   think that they were watching homegrown English language product, but 
   you would have to be braindead or severely retarded to believe that, 
   especially some of the names given to actors and behind-the-scenes 
   personnel. Some of the pseudonyms were brilliant, but some of them 
   were unfortunate, such as this film's Set Designer, Franco Fumagalli (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#PlotOfFear1976">PLOT
    OF FEAR</A></B> - 1976), who took or was given the nom de plume of 
   &quot;Frank Smokecocks&quot;, a name that would have given him a 
   lifetime of bullying if it were real (even though it's a literal 
   English translation of his name!). I've always considered Riccardo

   backs, among other atrocities. Also living at the boarding school is 
   Madame Fourneau's young teenage son, Luis (John Moulder-Brown; <B><A HREF="vampire_circus_1972.htm">VAMPIRE
    CIRCUS</A></B> - 1972), whom she keeps secluded away from the girls, 
   even though he occasionally escapes to peep on them. Madame Fourneau 
   doesn't believe these girls are good enough for her son, telling Luis 
   that the girls came to the school already &quot;marked&quot; and that 
   one day he will find a girl just like his mother, telling Luis, 
   &quot;You need a woman like me!&quot; (a creepy incestuous proposition).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It doesn't help that the school also harbors a killer, who murders 
   some of the worst students. Is Madame Fourneau covering up the 
   murders by telling the other students that they ran away from school 
   or is it possible that she doesn't know the truth (their bodies are 
   never found)? Not that there aren't enough red herrings on hand to 
   feed a family of five at dinner. Besides Luis (who we see playing 
   gently with an ant on an open book and then slamming it shut, 
   squishing the ant and showing us his dual personality), there's 
   Brechard (Victor Israel; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#HouseInsaneWomen71">THE
    HOUSE OF INSANE WOMEN</A></B> - 1971), the school's groundskeeper, 
   who likes to stare at the girls through windows. There is also the 
   mysterious Enrique (Clovis Dave), who visits the school every 
   Wednesday to drop off wood for the furnace and to screw one of the 
   lucky girls, who take turns with him every week! There is also Irene 
   (Mary Maude; <B><A HREF="crucible_of_terror_1971.htm">CRUCIBLE OF TERROR</A></B> 
   - 1971), who is Madame Fourneau's underling (and student), who is 
   more than happy to do all her nasty, violent punishments (she gets 
   off sexually by whipping the girls, as you will see on her face). The 
   truth is it could be anyone, since most of the students come from 
   troubled, even violent, backgrounds (Teresa's mother, who has never 
   been married, is a dancer at a cabaret, both things, being a single 
   mother and a cabaret dancer, are looked down upon during this time in history).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When Luis' secret girlfriend, student Isabelle (Maribel Martin; <B><A HREF="#BloodSpatBride1972">THE
    BLOOD SPATTERED BRIDE</A></B> - 1972), is viciously stabbed in the 
   greenhouse while arriving for a secret rendezvous with Luis, Madame 
   Fourneau tells the other students that she flew the coop and orders 
   that all the locks on the doors of the school be changed, with only 
   her, Irene and second-in-command, Madame Desprez (Candida Losada; <B><A HREF="supernatural_1981.htm">SUPERNATURAL</A></B> 
   - 1981), to have copies of the keys. We also discover that Madame 
   Fourneau is so sexually oppressed, she will not let the students take 
   showers in the nude, watching them shower in their nightdresses! When 
   one student decides to strip off her clothes and showers in the nude, 
   we can see on Madame Fourneau's face that she is taken aback, but is 
   getting a sexual thrill from it. Luis, who uses the school's heating 
   ducts to spy on the girls, spots Teresa and it is love at first peep 
   and Teresa reciprocates, getting Irene in a ire and threatening to 
   tell Madame Fourneau unless she does her bidding. Teresa is brought 
   to the school's basement, where Irene's secret torture room is 
   located. Irene lets Teresa know that Madame Fourneau lets her read 
   everyone's file and she knows that Teresa's mother is a cabaret 
   dancer (&quot;Only prostitutes work in cabarets. Is your mother a 
   prostitute?&quot;) and if she doesn't want all the other students to 
   know the truth, she will sing for her and the two other students in 
   the room, cohorts Ingrid (Maria Gustafsson: <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#FourthVictim1971">THE
    FOURTH VICTIM</A></B> - 1971) and Andrea (Teresa Hurtado), who all 
   belittle and degrade her relentlessly until Teresa cries (It is easy 
   to see that Irene really enjoys doing this and tells Teresa they will 
   do it again at the same place and time tomorrow). That night, Teresa 
   sneaks into Luis' room and tells him she is leaving. Luis doesn't 
   want her to leave, but when he realizes she is serious, he breaks 
   open his piggy bank and gives her all the money he has, telling her 
   the only way to escape the school is to climb the iron gate to the 
   entrance of the school because his mother ordered Brechard to cut 
   down all the &quot;creepers&quot; on the stone walls that surround 
   the school so no one could climb them to escape. All this is for 
   naught, for as Teresa tries to escape that night, someone sneaks up 
   behind her and cuts her throat. When Teresa comes up missing the next 
   morning, Madame Fourneau tells everyone that she's another escapee, 
   but Irene says that cannot be, she saw Teresa escape from her bedroom 
   window and she stood guard by the iron gate last night in the pouring 
   rain to make sure she didn't escape. Madame Fourneau tells Irene to 
   shut up, but when Irene threatens to tell people about her cruelty 
   and lawless tactics, Madame Fourneau takes away all of Irene's 
   powers, taking her keys and telling Irene she's just another student 
   now. Irene tries to escape the school in the middle of the night, but 
   she finds all the doors locked and hears Madame Fourneau approaching, 
   so she runs to the attic, where the film concludes, exposing the 
   killer's identity. Expect a truly twisted finale, one you will never

    I decided to view this film again after learning of the death of 
   director/screenwriter Narciso Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez Serrador on June 
   07, 2019 at the age of 83 (Serrador is credited as screenwriter on 
   this film as &quot;Luis Ver&ntilde;a Pe&ntilde;afiel&quot;). I had 
   forgotten how good this film was, on par with his <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#WhoCanKillAChild">WHO
    CAN KILL A CHILD?</A></B> (1975). Serrador worked mainly in Spanish 
   television (read my <A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_3.htm#NarcisoIbanezSerrad">obituary</A>),
    where he was considered a major influence of many of Spain's future 
   directors. He may have only made two theatrical films), but both of 
   them were very memorable. (His third theatrical film, <B><A HREF="master_of_terror_1965.htm">MASTER
    OF HORROR</A></B> [1965], was actually an edited version of episodes 
   of a late-'50s/early-'60s Spanish TV series titled &quot;<B><A HREF="master_of_terror_1965.htm#MasterpiecesOfTerro">Obras
    Maestras Del Terror</A></B>&quot; [&quot;Masterpieces Of

    OF THE WEREWOLF</A></B> - 1980], a famous Spanish actor who was 
   fondly known as Spain's Lon Chaney, due to him changing his 
   appearance in nearly every film he was in, thanks to his trusty 
   makeup kit, which he always had with him). This one is a whipsmart 
   story (pun intended) of sexual oppression/repression and the violence 
   it causes, but<A HREF="house_that_screamed_1969.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/house that screamed spain poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="207" HEIGHT="291" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   I was taken aback by the film's total lack of nudity and graphic 
   violence. There is plenty of female flesh on view, but I doubt anyone 
   would call it nudity in the purest sense. There is also some violence 
   on view, but, just like the nudity, director Serrador makes you 
   believe you saw more than there really was (Tobe Hooper would copy 
   this technique for <B><A HREF="texas_chainsaw_massacre_1974.htm">THE 
   TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE</A></B> - 1974). This is a masterwork of both 
   style and substance that fans of giallo and Gothic horror are bound 
   to enjoy, where scares lurk in every shadow, people say the most 
   hurtful things (both deliberately and unintentionally) and it is hard 
   to trust anyone. What we have here is a great mystery interspersed 
   among the Gothic horror, with a finale that will knock your socks 
   off. <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">SPOILER ALERT!!! Do not read if you

   (A.I.P.) in 1971, which was rated GP (the late'60s/early-'70s version

   film in the States. The first time this film appeared on disc was as 
   a <A HREF="house_that_screamed_1969.htm#ElviraDVD">double feature DVD</A>

   it compromises the atmospheric cinematography by Manuel Berenguer (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightOfThe Devils72">THE

    The film opens with a prostitute trying to thumb a ride and not 
   being successful at it, so she steps in front of the next car, the 
   driver stopping and telling her to get in. She offers to perform oral 
   sex on the driver, Eric (Howard Vernon; <B><A HREF="faceless_1987.htm">FACELESS</A></B> 
   - 1987), but he refuses, telling her he has a boss&nbsp; that will 
   pay her handsomely for her services. She agrees to it, so Eric drives 
   her to his boss' mansion. It is the home of failed (but rich) actor 
   Hector Doriani (Paul Naschy; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CurseOfTheDevil1973">CURSE
    OF THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1973), whose brother, Alex Doriani (Naschy 
   again; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hunchback Morgue">HUNCHBACK OF 
   THE MORGUE</A></B> - 1973) was a world famous horror film star until 
   he committed suicide by putting a pistol to his head and pulling the 
   trigger, leaving behind a wife, Lorena (Isabel Prinz; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#SlugsTheMovie">SLUGS:
    THE MOVIE</A></B> - 1987), and a young son, Adrian (Sergio Molina, 
   using the pseudonym &quot;Serg Mills&quot;; the Naschy-directed <B><A HREF="beast_and_the_magic_sword_1983.htm">THE
    BEAST AND THE MAGIC SWORD</A></B> - 1983). When Lorena was found 
   dead of a drug overdose a couple of years later, Hector was awarded 
   guardianship of nephew Adrian, along with his brother's vast fortune. 
   Hector abuses Adrian both mentally and physically and punishes him 
   often, because when he looks at him, he's reminded of his successful 
   brother. He won't allow Adrian to watch any of his father's horror 
   films, saying to him that they are &quot;trash&quot; (When he catches 
   Adrian watching one of his father's horror films, Hector puts his 
   beefy hand over Adrian's face and pushes him to the ground). He also 
   won't allow Adrian to have any friends, which troubles manservant 
   Eric and housekeeper/cook Carmen (Caroline Munro; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Demons6-1989">DEMONS
    6: DE PROFUNDIS</A></B> - 1989), who both tell Hector a boy his age 
   needs friends to play with. Adrian has found a solution to that 
   problem; for when he is alone, which is often, he imagines his father 
   visiting him as one of the characters of his horror films, be it <A HREF="howl_of_the_devil_1988.htm#FrankensteinMonster">The

    Now let's get back to the prostitute.&nbsp; After spending a long 
   time waiting for Hector to appear, she is about to leave when Eric 
   appears and escorts her to a room, telling her that when she enters 
   it, &quot;time has no meaning&quot; there, it is like &quot;time 
   stands still.&quot; She enters the room and is greeted by Hector, 
   whom is dressed and made-up like <A HREF="howl_of_the_devil_1988.htm#Nostradamus">Nostradamus</A> 
   (she has no idea who that is!). It's obvious that Hector is not only 
   jealous of his brother's horror film characters, he is also into very 
   rough sex and has a low opinion of women. After he is done with her, 
   Hector tells Eric to give the &quot;bitch&quot; $400 and kick her out 
   of the house. Eric offers to drive her to wherever she needs to go 
   since it is 4:00 AM and the mansion is a long distance from the city, 
   but Hector says no, all women are sluts and don't deserve any type of 
   kindness, ordering Eric to kick her out and be quick about it. We 
   then see the prostitute walking in the forest, lost, when someone 
   dressed as a giallo villain (fedora, black gloves and a long 
   overcoat) slices her stomach open with a knife, killing her. This 
   unknown killer will strike often in this film and there are many 
   suspects, or should I say, red herrings. There is Eric, who despises 
   Hector, but he stays for Adrian, whom he loves (and vice versa). Eric 
   is also into the Black Arts, as we see him summoning the spirit of 
   Alex, who promises he will return, but it is too early for him to do 
   so (he tells Eric to stop summoning him because it is very painful). 
   There's also priest Father Damian (Fernando Hilbeck; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DemonWitchChild1974">DEMON
    WITCH CHILD</A></B> - 1974), who once had an illicit love affair 
   with Carmen and threatens to kill her if she doesn't return to him 
   (his hatred for women matches Hector's). Also a suspect is Zacarias 
   (Cris Huerta; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Rage1984">RAGE</A></B> 
   - 1984), a drunken bum Father Damian has hired to spy on Carmen, to 
   make sure she's not having sex with Hector or has any lovers visiting 
   her at the mansion. And, of course, there is Hector, who hates all 
   women except for the dead Lorena, whom he adores, having a photo of 
   her on a table that he orders Eric not to touch. Yet Hector keeps 
   hitting on Carmen, telling her that one day he will bed her and she 
   will be his. Carmen wants nothing to do with Hector, telling him the 
   only reason she stays is because of Adrian, whom she cares for just 
   as much (if not more) than Eric (and, just like Eric, Adrian loves 
   her, too).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As more women come to the mansion and have sex with Hector (who 
   dresses and is made-up like Richard III and <A HREF="howl_of_the_devil_1988.htm#FuManchu">FuManChu</A>!),
    they, too, are murdered by the unknown killer after Hector is done 
   with them. One is disemboweled, her innards falling on the forest 
   grounds. Another has her throat cut from ear-to-ear and still another 
   has a <A HREF="howl_of_the_devil_1988.htm#KnifeInHead">knife thrust 
   into the back of her head until the blade exits out of her mouth</A>. 
   We even see the killer use a giant pair of tongs to rip off one of 
   his female victim's nipples (with nothing left to the imagination). 
   The mansion is also invaded by a&nbsp; male/female team of wanted 
   criminals and they threaten to kill everyone, including Adrian, but 
   when the police knock on the front door and tell Hector that they 
   will return in an hour to check-up on him, the criminals get spooked 
   and leave, only to get bloodily dispatched by the gloved killer. As 
   things get bloodier and bloodier, Eric is able to conjure-up Alex 
   from the other side, this time for good, but Eric has upsetted <A HREF="howl_of_the_devil_1988.htm#Devil">Satan</A> 
   (also portrayed by Naschy) and Alex is nothing but a <A HREF="howl_of_the_devil_1988.htm#Alex'sCorpse">decaying
    corpse</A> (Alex says to Eric: &quot;Your summoning forced me into a 
   condemned body. Unfortunately, I was murdered in the state of sin. 
   Therefore, I'm condemned forever. You weren't thinking. You have 
   unleashed Hell. You have brought Satan!&quot; Try to figure that one 
   out!). Alex then rips out Eric's eyes for pissing off the Devil. We 
   then discover that it was Adrian who was killing everyone, as 
   flashbacks show us that Lorena and Hector were lovers, not knowing 
   that Adrian watched as Lorena put a pistol to Alex's head while he 
   was passed-out drunk on his bed, pulling the trigger and making it 
   look like Alex committed suicide, while Hector watches, smiling and 
   laughing. Adrian then much later murdered his mother (proving that 
   revenge is, indeed, a dish best served cold), making it look like an 
   accidental drug overdose. He killed all the women because he watched 
   Hector make love to them (spying on them though a hole in the eye of 
   one of the portraits hanging in Hector's makeout room) and imagined 
   them as his mother making love to Hector. Now it is Hector's turn to 
   die... painfully. Adrian now has his father back, not caring that he 
   is a rotting corpse. He longed for this day, his father telling him 
   that one day his reign will end and Adrian will rule...as the 
   Anti-Christ! WTF?!?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Some people may call this film misogynistic and they wouldn't be 
   wrong...to a degree. While most of the women&nbsp; here can be 
   considered &quot;loose&quot;, there is a strong female presence in 
   Carmen, who continually refutes male chauvinist Hector's sexual 
   advances, even when he offers her expensive jewels to go to bed with 
   him. Yes, she did have a brief affair with Father Damian (Who meets a 
   fitting demise. When he sneaks into the mansion, he is met by Alex's 
   decaying corpse, who lifts the sinful priest up in the air by the 
   neck with one hand, crushing his throat) but she knew what she did 
   was wrong, as Father Damian was a woman-hating bastards who still 
   preached to his mostly female flock every Sunday, so she broke it 
   off. Zacarias (who gets an axe planted in his back) verbally and 
   physically abuses Carmen, blaming his alcoholism on a woman who 
   wronged him in the past and taking it out on Carmen, making nearly 
   every male character in this film a misogynist. Carmen knows it, but 
   still pays for it in the end when she agrees to go to bed with Hector 
   after nearly being raped by Father Damian (She only does it because 
   she knows Zacarias is watching and will tell the sin-filled priest, 
   pissing him off to no end). Both she and Hector are murdered by 
   Adrian when he impales them with a<A HREF="howl_of_the_devil_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/howl of the devil spain poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   metal spear while Hector is on top of Carmen, screwing her (He 
   imagines Carmen is his mother). Still, this is an interesting horror 
   film with a lot of symbolism if you know where to look (especially in 
   the room where Eric performs his black magic rites). Late in the 
   film, we learn some unsavory things Eric has done in his past (such 
   as having underage sex with male children) that makes his gory death 
   fitting (When he stumbles outside, eyeless, during a thunderstorm, he 
   is hit by a bolt of lightning and explodes!), even though we cared 
   for him until the revelation about his past. Paul Naschy does a solid 
   job with his direction (other films he directed include <B><A HREF="inquisition_1976.htm">INQUISITION</A></B> 
   - 1976; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightOfThe Werewolf">NIGHT OF

    BEATS</A></B> - 1983) and the screenplay, which he co-authored with 
   an uncredited Salvador S&aacute;inz (a bit actor in Naschy's 
   previously mentioned <B><A HREF="panic_beats_1983.htm">PANIC BEATS</A></B> 
   and <B><A HREF="beast_and_the_magic_sword_1983.htm">THE BEAST AND THE 
   MAGIC SWORD</A></B>), hits all the right notes, even if the story is 
   unsavory. Fans of full-frontal female nudity and graphic violence are 
   sure to have a ball with this film and no one can do unsufferable, 
   unfeeling men better than Naschy. Even though this was made in the 
   late-'80s, it has the look and feel of a '70s Spanish horror film, 
   thanks to Naschy's knowledge of the time period. And that's why it 
   comes recommended from yours truly. I love '70s horror films made in 
   Spain and, even though this isn't one of them, it sure has all the 
   ingredients that makes them so entertaining.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Shot as <B><A HREF="howl_of_the_devil_1988.htm#Spain Title">EL 
   AULLIDO DEL DIABLO</A></B> (a literal translation of the review 
   title), this film received very little distribution around the world 
   due to its troubled production history, making its premiere on 
   Spanish television in 1989. No theatrical or home video release in 
   any format in the United States or in most of the rest of the world, 
   this film is screaming for an official Blu-Ray release&nbsp; with all 
   the bells and whistles. I know it will be a big seller because there 
   are many Paul Naschy fans out there. I caught it streaming on 
   YouTube, on channel &quot;deedeekingisdead&quot;, in a very fuzzy 
   fullscreen print (it was impossible to read the opening red credits), 
   which shouldn't be too much of a surprise since it was a dupe of a 
   VHS tape from the defunct Video Search Of Miami (VSOM), a gray market 
   company who were known for their lousy-looking prints, but they had 
   some amazingly obscure films (especially back then) in their library, 
   many of them that they subtitled in English (like this film) for the 
   very first time. I admit that I used them a few times, even if they 
   made you join their &quot;club&quot; (costing you more money) before 
   you could order their expensive tapes. This film is still watchable, 
   but I would pay handsomely for a remastered print, as would many 
   other people. Are you listening Code Red, Blue Underground or Shout

   (1980) -</B> Since I have been reviewing basically nothing but 
   Italian genre films for the past year, I decided it was time to turn 
   my attention to the master that jump-started the giallo genre in the 
   early-'70s, namely Dario Argento. Yes, there were many giallo flicks 
   being made in Italy and abroad before Argento came onto the scene, 
   but Argento's first two directorial efforts, <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BirdCrystalPlum1970">THE

    CAT O' NINE TAILS</A></B> (1971), were not just unqualified 
   successes in Italy, they were extremely popular across the world, so 
   there were a glut of giallo films being produced after that (the majority<A HREF="inferno_1980.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/inferno 1980 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="209" HEIGHT="310" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   of them reviewed on this site), most of them with a number or a 
   species of animal or insect in the title, hoping to catch a ride on 
   Argento's comet-like tail. A lot of excellent giallo films followed, 
   as well as many below-average or average ones, but they would have 
   never been made at all without Argento's input in this genre. While 
   this film isn't a giallo, it is Argento's middle film in his 
   &quot;Three Mothers&quot; trilogy, starting with <B><A HREF="#Suspiria1977">SUSPIRIA</A></B> 
   (1977; Mater Suspiriorum - &quot;The Mother of Sighs&quot;) and 
   ending with <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#MotherOfTears">MOTHER OF TEARS</A></B> 
   (2007; Mater Lachrymarum). This film pertains to Mater Tenebrarum, 
   the &quot;Mother of Darkness&quot;, and she's the most malevolent 
   Mother of them all, yet, for some reason, this film doesn't get the 
   recognition it so richly deserves and it could be because of the 
   stiff and lackluster performance of the main male actor, Leigh 
   McCloskey (<B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#BermudaDepths">THE BERMUDA DEPTHS</A></B> 
   - 1978), who used his &quot;talents&quot; to become a soap opera star 
   in the States. But I had no problem overlooking his performance and 
   just went along for the ride. There is also something else you should 
   know about the film before watching it. Argento became severely ill 
   with a bout of hepatitis during filming and was bedridden. According 
   to various sources, Mario Bava (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BayOfBlood1971">A
    BAY OF BLOOD</A></B> - 1971), who was the visual effects 
   creator/second unit director/camera operator on this film, filled in 
   as director when Argento was too ill to direct and he ended up 
   directing much of what you see in the film (following Argento's 
   meticulous notes). Mario Bava passed away a few weeks after this film 
   premiered theatrically in Italy, so this is Bava's true last film 
   behind the camera. With all of the trivia out of the way, lets get to 
   the film itself.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We see Rose Elliot (Irene Miracle; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Night Train Murders">THE
    NIGHT TRAIN MURDERS</A></B> - 1974) reading a book about the Three 
   Mothers, while an offscreen narrator reads this chapter: &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">Each
    of the Three Mothers live in their own separate dwellings. One in 
   Rome, one in New York and one in Freiberg, Germany. The Three Mothers 
   rule the world, with sorrow, tears and darkness. Mater Suspiriorum, 
   the Mother of Sighs, and the oldest of the three, lives in Freiburg. 
   Mater Lachrymarum, the Mother of Tears and the most beautiful of the 
   sisters, holds rule in Rome. Mater Tenebrarum, the Mother of 
   Darkness, who is the youngest and cruelest of the three, controls New 
   York. Each dwelling contains the repository of all their filthy 
   secrets. Those so-called mothers are actually wicked stepmothers, 
   incapable of creating life. The land on which the three houses have 
   been constructed will eventually become deathly and plague-ridden, so 
   much so that the area around will reek horribly. And that is the 
   first key to the Mothers' secret. Truly, the primary key. The second 
   key to the poisonous secret of the Three Sisters is hidden in the 
   cellar under their houses. There you can find both the picture and 
   the name of the Sister living in that home. This is the location of 
   the second key. The third key can be found under the soles of your 
   shoes. There is the third key.</FONT></B>&quot; Rose then writes a 
   letter to her brother Mark (Leigh McCloskey; <B><A HREF="camerons_closet_1987.htm">CAMERON'S
    CLOSET</A></B> - 1987), who is studying music in Rome, but we are 
   not privy as to what is in the letter...yet.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Rose is living in a foreboding building in New York and walks 
   outside to put the letter in a mailbox, She then talks to Mr. 
   Kazanian (Sacha Pitoeff; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#PatrickStillLives80">PATRICK
    STILL LIVES</A></B> - 1980), a bookstore owner in the building next 
   door who sold her the book on the Three Mothers. She tells him that 
   there's an awful smell emanating in the area and he tells her to give 
   it time, she will get use to it. He also tells her that the only true 
   mystery is that &quot;our lives are governed by dead people.&quot; 
   What could he possibly mean by that? We then discover that Rose is 
   looking for the second key, so she goes down to her building's cellar 
   (after a black cat crosses her path, uh oh!) and amongst the cobwebs 
   she discovers a leaky pipe that must have been leaking for quite some 
   time because the water has carved a path into the concrete floor. She 
   follows the flowing water and comes to a small pool. He necklace 
   falls into the pool and she discovers that the pool is rather deep, 
   so deep that Rose has to swim underwater to search for her heirloom. 
   She sees her necklace at the bottom but has to come up for some air. 
   She then swims to the bottom, picks up her necklace and is assaulted 
   by a rotting corpse. She tries to surface, but can't seem to find the 
   opening. Just when it looks like Rose is about to drown, she finds 
   the opening and runs out of the cellar, not noticing that she has 
   dropped her lighter. We then see a black-gloved hand picking up the 
   lighter and then the ceiling collapses in the cellar.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then switch to Rome, where Mark is at a class on classical music 
   in a huge auditorium at a university. Mark is reading his sister's 
   letter, which begins with, &quot;My dear brother Mark. As you know, 
   here in New York, I've been living in a rather old building for quite 
   some time...&quot; As Mark is reading the letter, he sees a beautiful 
   young woman holding a white Persian cat talking to him, but no words 
   are coming out of her mouth. Mark puts the letter back in the 
   envelope, not reading the rest, and follows the woman out of the 
   auditorium, forgetting the letter on his desk. Fellow student Sara 
   (Eleonora Giorgi; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#BlackBellyTarantula">BLACK
    BELLY OF THE TARANTULA</A></B> - 1971) picks up the letter and reads 
   it. It affects her in ways she cannot understand and asks a cab 
   driver to take her to a very old library, which she has never been to 
   before. As soon as she steps out of the taxi, she smells a very 
   strange odor (uh oh!) and goes inside, asking an elderly bookbinder 
   (Luigi Lodoli; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Rush1983">RUSH</A></B> 
   - 1983) where she can find the book on the Three Mothers. Sara finds 
   a diary written in Latin and from that moment on, her life will never 
   be the same, if she has any life left at all. When she tries to leave 
   the library, she gets the feeling she is being followed and gets 
   lost, entering a room that looks like an alchemist's laboratory. A 
   man grabs the diary out of Sara's hands and she runs for her life, 
   taking a taxi home and meeting friend Carlo (Gabriele Lavia; 
   Argento's <B><A HREF="sleepless_2001.htm">SLEEPLESS</A></B> - 2001) 
   in the elevator. Sara tells him she's scared and doesn't want to be 
   alone tonight, so Carlo accompanies Sara to her apartment. She then 
   calls Mark and tells him to come over, he has to read his sister's 
   letter immediately. The lights suddenly go out in Sara's apartment 
   and Carlo checks the fusebox. When Carlo re-enters the room, he has a 
   huge knife sticking in his neck, the blade protruding out the other 
   side. The black-gloved killer pulls the knife out of Carlo's neck and 
   stabs Sara in the back, killing her. Mark then arrives at the 
   apartment and discovers Sara's dead body. When the police arrive at 
   the apartment, Mark notices the beautiful catwoman in the back of a 
   taxicab, riding away from the scene of the crime and smiling at Mark. 
   He then phones Rose and she tells him to come to New York 
   immediately, then the phone goes dead.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then watch as Rose is being stalked by the black-gloved killer. 
   For some reason I don't understand (Maybe to find her lighter?), Rose 
   goes back down to the cellar and notices a broken window that is 
   letting the pouring rain flood the floor. Suddenly, a pair of 
   grizzled, monstrous hands grab Rose's head, putting her head under a 
   sheet of glass (a Argento trademark), slamming the edge of the sheet 
   of glass repeatedly across her throat, nearly decapitating her, her 
   blood spurting on the walls. Mark arrives in New York and goes to 
   Rose's apartment, meeting a nurse (Veronica Lazar: Argento's <B><A HREF="stendhal_syndrome_1996.htm">THE
    STENDHAL SYNDROME</A></B> - 1996) and the elderly wheelchair-bound 
   Professor Arnold (Feodor Chaliapin; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Church1989">THE
    CHURCH</A></B> - 1989) in the elevator. Rose is nowhere to be found, 
   but Mark finds the word &quot;MATER&quot; carved into the top of her 
   desk. Mark then meets Rose's friend and neighbor, Elise (Daria 
   Nicolodi; Bava's <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Shock1977">SHOCK</A></B> 
   - 1977), who shows Mark a small hole in the wall, telling him every 
   apartment has one and they are connected to a series of pipes. The 
   pipe in Rose's wall leads to Elise's apartment and they used it to 
   talk to each other late at night (This is important information, so 
   pay attention!). It seems that Elise is rather wealthy and she has a 
   butler named John (Leopoldo Mastelloni; <B><A HREF="to_be_twenty_1978.htm">TO
    BE TWENTY</A></B> - 1978) who dotes on her. Elise notices that she 
   has blood on the sole of her foot and could have only come from 
   Rose's apartment. Mark and Elise discover a trail of blood (which 
   neither of them first noticed because the carpet in the apartment is 
   blood red in color) leads to a service entrance, which Elise says is 
   never used. Mark follows the trail of blood alone (Elise is too 
   scared) down a metal spiral staircase and then passes out. Elise 
   finds a bloody handprint hidden in a curtain and runs to go tell 
   Mark, but she sees someone or something dragging Mark's body away. 
   Elise is then attacked by a pack of cats (look closely and you can 
   see the hands of a crew member throwing a cat at her!) and the killer 
   stabs her to death with a knife. We then find out that Mark may have 
   a heart condition and any sudden jolt could render him unconscious or 
   kill him (Mark denies having a heart condition, but is he telling the truth?).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Mark talks to Mr. Kazanian, whom he spots complaining to the 
   building's caretaker, Carol (Alida Valli; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#KillerNun1978">KILLER
    NUN</A></B> - 1978), about the proliferation of cats in his 
   bookstore, which he blames on her building. Mr. Kazanian tells Mark 
   nothing about his sister, but tells him there will be a rare lunar 
   eclipse tonight. We then see Kazanian killing a cat in his bookstore 
   (brutal) and then stuffing a bunch of cats in a burlap sack, which he 
   drowns in a nearby lake. Unfortunately for the crippled Kazanian, who 
   walks with the aide of crutches, he falls into the lake and is 
   devoured by rats! A butcher hears Kazanian's cries for help and runs 
   to him (watch closely as he walks, or rather runs, on water!), but 
   instead of helping, he cuts off Kazanian's head with a large knife! 
   What in the hell is going on here???</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    John, who is working in conjunction with Carol and the nurse, who 
   turns out to be Mater Tenebrarum, has his eyes ripped out of their 
   sockets (a great shock cut) by the Mater. Carol then bursts into 
   flames and falls out her apartment window, through a glass ceiling 
   below (Argento has a thing for breaking glass, as it is in most of 
   his films). Mark figures out where the third key is hidden when he 
   looks at a photo of the front of the building and figures out that 
   the decorative ornaments that adorn every floor are actually musical 
   notes, leading him to the location of the third key. Will Mark get to 
   the key in time to stop this madness or is all his effort for naught? 
   C'mon now, you didn't actually think I would tell you,<A HREF="inferno_1980.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/inferno 1980 british blu-ray front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="258" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>

    While this film fails to satisfy the logical mind, there is no 
   denying that it has an atmosphere of dread that just won't quit. I 
   actually like this film much more than <B><A HREF="suspiria_1977.htm">SUSPIRIA</A></B> 
   or <B><A HREF="mother_of_tears_2007b.htm">MOTHER OF TEARS</A></B> 
   because of its atmosphere and the well-crafted set-pieces, many of 
   them shocking and unexpected. What Mark finds when locating the third 
   key is so well done and surprising, you'll rewind it several times 
   just to take it all in (and this was done before CGI!). Argento 
   wanted to scrap this shot, but Mario Bava showed him that it could be 
   done realistically and cheaply. There is no doubt in my mind that 
   Argento is a master visual storyteller, because he can make even the 
   most disjointed of stories, such as the one in this film, 
   entertaining and ensuring that you not take your eyes off the screen. 
   I have always said that he gives David Lynch a run for his money, 
   maybe even surpassing him in sheer visual weirdness alone. The only 
   negative point is Leigh McCloskey's unemotional acting. His facial 
   expression never changes, whether terrified or running out of a 
   burning building. He would probably wear the same expression if he 
   were squeezing a hard turd out his asshole, but he really does 
   nothing to hurt this film because it is 90% atmosphere, 10% plot. The 
   music score, by the late Keith Emerson (Lucio Fulci's <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#MurderRock">MURDER-ROCK:
    DANCING DEATH</A></B> - 1984) is appropriately haunting and 
   effective. They don't get much better than this, folks.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This film had an uneventful theatrical release in the United States 
   because Twentieth Century-Fox really had no idea on how to promote 
   this film properly, so it came and went fairly fast, even though the 
   film was not edited (a first for an Argento film). It then showed up 
   on fullscreen VHS from Key Video (owned by Twentieth Century-Fox) 
   with an incorrect running time of 84 minutes listed on the sleeve, 
   even though it was the full 106-minute edit. In 2000, Anchor Bay 
   Entertainment (who else?) released an uncut print in its OAR on <A HREF="inferno_1980.htm#Anchor BayVHS">VHS</A> 
   and <A HREF="inferno_1980.htm#AnchorBayDVD">DVD</A>. A few years 
   later, Blue Underground (who else?) released it on DVD and Blu-Ray. 
   All the discs have a very interesting interview with Argento and 
   Lamberto Bava, who was this film's first assistant director, working 
   alongside his father. Argento tells us that all the shots of the 
   killer's hands are his (as they are in all of his films) and Bava 
   tells us that this film made him hate cats because he had to wrangle 
   them here and he grew to hate the smell of their fur. He still can't 
   stand them up to this day. Also starring Paolo Paoloni (<B><A HREF="cannibal_holocaust_1980.htm">CANNIBAL

    AMERICAN STYLE</A><A NAME="KillingAmerStyle88"></A> (1988) -</B> For 
   those of you (like myself) who like their action films that seem to 
   come from some alternate universe, where everyone knows martial arts, 
   the cops are about as helpful as a tick on a deer, guns never seem to 
   run out of bullets and the bad guys somehow multiply out of thin air, 
   then there is no one better at that than director/screenwriter Amir 
   Shervan. He previously gave us the WTF?!? action film <B><A HREF="action.htm#Hollywood Cop">HOLLYWOOD
    COP</A></B> (1986) and would just a mere year later after this film 
   deliver his cinematic masterpiece called <B><A HREF="#SamuraiCop">SAMURAI
    COP</A></B>. Shervan (who passed away in 2006) was independently 
   wealthy and made films his own way (and it shows), but there seems to 
   be no gray area when it comes to his films. Either you love 'em or 
   hate 'em. Me? I love them with all my heart just because we get to 
   see one man make films his way and not by committee and he had a 
   stable of actors who would follow him to the ends of the Earth. They 
   knew they weren't making anything classic, but since each film took 
   about 30 days to shoot, these people had good-paying jobs with a 
   person who treated them and their ideas like gold. Everyone I have 
   heard speak about Amir Shervan speaks about him as a man who just 
   wanted to make films (at one time, he owned about 70% of all theaters 
   in Iran, before he moved to the U.S.) and was willing to take chances 
   with unknown actors and give well-established actors parts in his 
   films, too. True, the well-established actors were at the low-ebb of 
   their careers, but at least he gave them jobs. And he simply loved 
   the late Robert Z'Dar, who appearred in every film he made (there are 
   still two more Shervan films out there still <A HREF="killing_american_style_1988htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/killing american style dvd9 front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="229" HEIGHT="318" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>waiting

   [1992], which should be available on DVD a short time after you read 
   this). Yes, I know, Shervan was Iranian, but his heart was pure 
   American cheese, and we should all be happy about that and put our 
   prejudices aside and just go along for the weird trip. The film 
   starts out with scumbag crook Lynch (John Lynch) 
   &quot;interviewing&quot; five young female dancers for one opening he 
   has in his club. The first two fail, but the third one hits his zone 
   (he must be a tit man because she has the biggest ones) and he takes 
   her to a dressing room for her &quot;interview&quot;. Head bad guy 
   Tony Stone (the late Robert Z'Dar; it still hurts my heart to say 
   &quot;late&quot;) comes walking into Lynch's club and he knocks on 
   the dressing room door, saying, &quot;I have a big job. Zip it 
   up!&quot; Lynch tells his new dancer to &quot;keep it warm&quot; for 
   him (which she does by pinching her nipples!), as Tony, his brother 
   Jessie (G. Alexander Virdon, Virden or Verdan, depending what film he 
   was in), Lynch and Loony (Co-Procucer and Production Designer Jimmy 
   Williams), who is a little slow in his head, rob what looks like a 
   graveyard for old ice cream trucks with the help of a guard working 
   for them on the inside. Turns out today is the day all the employees 
   get paid and Tony and his mob rob the joint of a bagful of money 
   (employees get paid with cash?) after killing three guards and 
   leaving the premises. The head of the business (Will someone please 
   tell me what kind of business it is?) notices that the crooked guard 
   is shooting into the air rather than at Tony and his gang, so Tony 
   and Lynch get pinched by the police thanks to testimony from the 
   guard. We then see them all on a bus being driven to a maximum 
   security prison, when the bus driver notices what is obvious to the 
   viewer to be a staged accident and stops the bus. Loony (dressed as a 
   woman) and Jessie (playing a man pinned under a pickup truck) then 
   begin to kill all the guards and free Tony and Lynch, but Jessie gets 
   shot and seriously hurt in the process. Tony decides that they will 
   use the first house they find as a place to patch-up Jessie and not 
   leave until he is ready to be moved. It is then that the movie turns 
   into a perverse take on <B><A HREF="desperate_hours_1955.htm">THE 
   DESPERATE HOURS</A></B> (the 1955 Bogey version, since the <A HREF="desperate_hours_1990.htm">1990
    Mickey Rourke version</A> wasn't even made yet), but with the usual 
   Shervan twist. Tony just happens to pick the house of musclehead John 
   Morgan (Harold Diamond, who made three films with Shervan), a horse 
   farmer by trade who has a beautiful wife and sister-in-law and a son 
   who just wants to be like his father, so Dad takes him to martial 
   arts school. While Tony and his gang kill horse trainer Jose (Jessus 
   Quebus) and threaten the sunbathing bikini-clad sisters by the pool. 
   John and his son are at martial arts class, where a boy pushes around 
   John's son, but John reminds him of his training. It's when the kid's 
   father starts pushing around John that they take the battle to the 
   ring and John beats the snot out of him. Remember, do what Daddy 
   says, not what he does. John's wife Doris (Veronica Paul) tells John 
   that she is a nurse (what are the chances?) and she will do her best 
   to patch up Jessie as long as they promise to leave as soon as 
   possible. John and his son arrive home to all this mess (John gets a 
   little beat-down from Tony and Lynch). When Doris decides she doesn't 
   have enough training to fix Jessie, she calls Dr. Fuji (regular 
   Shervan player Joselito C Rescobar; also an Executive Producer; he's 
   about as Japanese as I'm Korean!) to have John drive over to pick him 
   up so he can take care of Jessie's wounds and to make sure he doesn't 
   tell anyone where he is heading. Tony then calls his stepmother 
   (Sandy Palms; also Production Manager) to go to a motel to pick up 
   his bag of money (Wait a second, how did it get hidden there? That 
   room must have been rented out plenty of times after Tony was 
   convicted! My head hurts!) Stepmom makes some kind on boneheaded 
   remark that it may not be best to give him all the money at once 
   (Greedy little bitch!). John and Dr. Fuji are chased by the police, 
   but John manages to lose them in a really bad car chase (I would have 
   stopped for a second, explained my situation to the officers and had 
   the cops surround the place, but that's just me.). Meanwhile, Lt. 
   Sunset (a bored-looking Jim Brown, but you could never tell when 
   Brown was bored or excited) starts his own investigation and ends up 
   at a whorehouse that Tony's stepmother worked at, but is told she 
   hasn't been there for days (Lt. Sunset thanks a whore for putting her 
   tongue in his ear before he leaves!). John takes a chance and tries 
   to kill Tony, but Lynch knocks him out and later rapes Doris 
   doggie-style in their own bedroom while she is taking a bath and John 
   is unconscious on the bed (Wait a second. A bedroom with it's own 
   bathtub? Has anyone ever seen that? Anyone have a Tylenol?). John's 
   son manages to steal a gun from a sleeping Loony and he tries to give 
   it to his still groggy father (some hero he is!), so he gives it to 
   his mother, but Tony and the gang get the gun back when they threaten 
   to blow the boy's head off. (Loony goes off on Tony by asking, 
   &quot;Why do you keep calling me Loony? You know my name is 
   Charles!&quot; We then find out that Loony is Tony's Uncle and he 
   nicknamed him &quot;Loony&quot; because he's not all there in the 
   head.). Not trusting his stepmother, Tony sends John to pick up the 
   bag of money at the motel, which Lt. Sunset and his squad already 
   have staked out. They are keeping a close eye on Tony's stepmother 
   when John enters the scene and all the cops become so confused, they 
   make the Three Stooges look like MENSA members. John collects the 
   money (along with a handgun) and, after kicking a couple of cops in 
   the butt, manages to get away. Lt. Sunset (probably named that 
   because that is where his career is headed) and his Keystone Kops 
   look through the area for John, when Lt. Sunset finally hits on a 
   good idea. Find the house closest to the bus disaster. When John gets 
   home, he sees that Jose is dead. John hides the money and throws the 
   gun on the roof. When he gets into the house, he tells Tony and his 
   gang that stepmom fucked them over and took off with all the money. 
   While the gang tries to figure out what to do next, John has his son 
   climb on the roof to get the gun and Lynch calls in for enforcements. 
   His son gives John the gun and Loony is the first to die (Doris now 
   has Loony's shotgun). Lynch is the next to die while he tries to 
   circle around and ambush John, but John is too smart for that and 
   puts a slug in his chest (Doris finishes him off with a shotgun blast 
   to the balls for raping her). Dr. Fuji calls the police (who still 
   couldn't find John's farm!) and gives them all the information, while 
   Tony and Jessie (who is such a bad actor, he makes Tara Reid look 
   like a pro. He has an interview on the DVD, so you can judge for 
   yourself) try to get away. John begins to kill all the backup Lynch 
   called for (usually by gunshot, but there is some bad hand-to-hand 
   combat in there, too, as well as a fire gag). Tony grabs the dead 
   Jose's young son Fernando (Played by Jessus Quebus Jr., the real-life 
   son of the actor who played Jose) and uses him as a hostage. He will 
   give John the kid if he gives him the keys to his car. Before this 
   can happen, the police sirens rapidly get louder and John shoots and 
   kills Jessie. Lt. Sunset finally arrives and Tony uses Fernando as a 
   human shield. For some reason only known to Shervan, Tony throws away 
   his gun and Fernando and decides he would rather go hand-to-hand with 
   John. After a short fight, it ends with John and Lt. Sunset shooting 
   and killing Tony. John gives the bag of money to Jose's widow and 
   kids. Forget murder and rape, money solves everything, especially 
   money that is not yours to give away!&nbsp; Yes, this is as goofy as 
   it sounds, but there is so much more dialogue I haven't written down 
   that will make your head spin. One example is when Tony points a gun

   and says, &quot;Who's that bear?&quot; While not nearly as bat-shit 
   crazy as Shervan's other two previously released films, it is still a 
   mess of a film that will have you in stitches. Nearly everyone either 
   wears suits or sleeveless shirts and parachute pants, which makes it 
   totally 80's and 100% insane (just take a look at the martial arts 
   fight in the ring). Just enjoy it for what it is. If you can tell me 
   exactly what it is, you are a better person than I am. In any case, I 
   would recommend that you make Amir Shervan's films a permanent part 
   of your film library. Also known as <B><A HREF="american_murder_1988.htm">AMERICAN

   with an alien (portrayed by makeup effects artist Steve Neil), armed 
   with a laser weapon that fits over the hand and forearm, trying to 
   escape from a dinosaur-like alien duo (stop-motion effects by Dave 
   Allen), who<A HREF="laserblast_1978b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/laserblast vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="138" HEIGHT="252" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   are chasing him through the Arizona desert. The laser-carrying alien 
   is killed, but before the dino-aliens can collect the laser weapon 
   and the crystal medallion that operates it, a plane flies overhead 
   and the two aliens beat a hasty retreat back to their spaceship 
   before they are spotted. We then switch over to teen Billy Duncan 
   (Kim Milford; <B><A HREF="corvette_summer_1978.htm">CORVETTE SUMMER</A></B> 
   - 1978; who was well into his late-twenties when he essayed this 
   role), a lonely guy who lives with his absentee divorced mother, who 
   is once again leaving him alone to go on another &quot;business 
   trip&quot; to Acapulco (in other words, Mom's a slut).&nbsp; Billy 
   drives his yellow and white van to girlfriend Kathy's (Cheryl Smith; <B><A HREF="caged_heat_1974.htm">CAGED
    HEAT</A></B> - 1974) house to commiserate, but he is blocked by her 
   senile grandfather, Colonel Farley (Keenan Wynn; <B><A HREF="piranha_1977.htm">PIRANHA</A></B> 
   - 1977), who babbles-on about &quot;Operation Sandust&quot; and 
   people not being who they say they are. Billy finally gives up, gets 
   in his van and leaves. To make his day even worse, Billy is pulled 
   over by pot-smoking cops Deputy Pete Unger (Dennis Burkley; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Nightmare Honeymoon">NIGHTMARE
    HONEYMOON</A></B> - 1973) and Deputy Jesse Jeep (Barry Cutler), who 
   ticket him once again for speeding (Unger also makes an uncalled-for 
   remark about Billy's mom). To add insult to injury, Billy is 
   challenged to a race by town bullies Chuck (Mike Bobenko) and Froggy 
   (Eddie Deezen, in his film debut and the only time I can remember him 
   ever portraying a bully!), but his van won't start. When he finally 
   does get it started, Billy takes a drive out to the desert, where he 
   finds the laser weapon and the crystal medallion (he's a smart lad 
   and quickly learns how to use the weapon, blowing up cacti and tree 
   stumps). From this moment on, Billy's life will never be the same and 
   neither wll those who pick on him. There's one deadly caveat in using 
   the weapon, though: Every time Billy wears the crystal medallion and 
   fires the weapon, he slowly begins to transform into an alien 
   creature and starts to lose his compassion and humanity. To make 
   matters worse, government agent Tony Craig (Gianni Russo; <B><A HREF="lepke_1975.htm">LEPKE</A></B> 
   - 1975) and the two dino-aliens are looking to gain possession of the 
   weapon. When Chuck and Froggy try to rape Kathy at a pool party, 
   Billy dons the medallion and uses the weapon to blow-up Chuck's car, 
   nearly killing Chuck and Froggy. Billy begins growing a metallic lump 
   on his chest and, as it gets bigger and bigger, a worried Kathy makes 
   him go see Dr. Mellon (Roddy McDowall; <B><A HREF="legend_of_hell_house_1973.htm">THE
    LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE</A></B> - 1973) for a check-up. Dr. Mellon 
   removes the metallic fragment from Billy's chest and plans on driving 
   it to a lab out of town later that night to have it analyzed, but the 
   alien Billy uses the weapon to blow up Dr. Mellon in his car as he is 
   driving down the highway. Billy then uses the weapon to kill Deputy 
   Ungar (he blows him up in a gas station outhouse!) and Deputy Jeep 
   (incinerated point-bla<A HREF="laserblast_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/laserblast-end of the world ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="195" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>nk)
    and then turns his attention towards Chuck and Froggy (after blowing 
   a government search plane out of the sky); killing them by blowing 
   them up in Chuck's new muscle car. The alien Billy then kills a 
   stoner and steals his van (blowing up a <B><A HREF="star_wars_1977.htm">STAR
    WARS</A></B> billboard along the way, in a humorous bit), driving it 
   to town and using the weapon to lay waste to everything he can find, 
   including cars, telephone booths, a couple of newspaper stands and 
   the town's sheriff (Ron Masak). The dino-aliens put an end to the 
   madness by killing Billy with a death ray and take the weapon and the 
   medallion with them as they streak off in their spaceship.&nbsp; This 
   is a fun, if disjointed, little horror film, directed by Michael Rae 
   (his only directorial effort, although he was a Producer and Second 
   Unit Director on <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#SinnersBlood1970">SINNER'S
    BLOOD</A></B> - 1970) and written by Franne Schacht (who appears as 
   the sheriff's secretary) and Frank Ray Perilli (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Zoltan">ZOLTAN,
    HOUND OF DRACULA</A></B> - 1978), that contains a little bit of 
   everything, including action, aliens, explosions, stunts, minor gore 
   and even a small bit of topless nudity, all wrapped-up in a tight 
   little PG-rated package. Kim Milford, who tragically died in 1988 of 
   complication of heart surgery at the age of 37, is quite good as 
   Billy and his transformation into a soulless alien creature is quite 
   effective, but the film basically falls apart during the second half, 
   as it seems some scenes were never filmed (or were filmed and didn't 
   work) and the final twenty minutes are a disjointed, confusing mess 
   where the alien Billy just goes bonkers for no rhyme or reason. 
   Still, <B><A HREF="laserblast_1978b.htm">LASERBLAST</A></B> contains 
   enough weirdness (Dennis Burkley and Barry Cutler are the unlikeliest 
   cop duo in screen history, smoking dope, eating each other's food and 
   ogling women with wild abandon) and inventiveness (the stop-motion 
   aliens and the weapon itself) to be recommended viewing. Also

    As a young boy, Christian saw his father kill a young woman in a 
   bedroom whose walls are mirrors. Now an adult, Christian (an 
   impossibly young Giancarlo Giannini, here billed as &quot;John 
   Charlie Johns&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#BlackBellyTarantula">THE
    BLACK BELLY OF THE TARANTULA</A></B> - 1971) is going to live in a 
   creepy house he inherited from his father, who died twenty years 
   earlier, the same house where he saw his father kill the woman. 
   Joining Christian on this trip are his fiancee Eileen (Dominique 
   Boschero; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#IguanaTongueFire71">IGUANA 
   WITH THE TONGUE OF FIRE</A></B> - 1971), Paul (Luciano Pigozzi, using 
   his pseudonym &quot;Alan Collins&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Devil7Faces1971">THE
    DEVIL WITH SEVEN FACES</A></B> - 1971), Christian's ad-hoc guardian 
   since his father's death, and Paul's young wife Brigitte (Gastaldi's 
   wife Maraa Chianetta, using the name &quot;Mara Maryl&quot;; she was 
   one of the writers of <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#GreatAlligator">THE
    GREAT ALLIGATOR</A></B> - 1979). Christian is to inherit the house 
   and his father's vast fortune in three months, when he turns 25, but 
   until then, Paul, who is executor of his father's estate, is in 
   charge, of the house and the fortune. Christian and Paul have a 
   volatile relationship, as we discover early in the film (Paul likes 
   to remind Christian that he is in charge until he turns 25 and 
   Christian has anger issues). Christian tells Eileen that he doesn't 
   feel right about coming to the house (He hasn't been here for over 
   two decades, ever since his father murdered the woman), but her 
   presence makes him feel better. Paul and Brigitte take the mirrored 
   room as their bedroom and, that night, Christian watches Brigitte 
   dance the can-can and then do a striptease in the mirrored room, 
   stopping to make love to Paul. While watching the show (Brigitte may 
   very well know he is watching), Christian gets an eerie feeling and 
   runs away, saying, &quot;Not like my father! God, I'm not like my 
   father!&quot; Also that night, Eileen notices someone jiggling the 
   door knob to her bedroom, but then it stops. Could it have been 
   Christian? (Since this is the '60s and they are not married, 
   Christian and Eileen have separate bedrooms.)</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next morning, everyone is outside enjoying the sunny weather. as 
   we discover that the house is located next to a cliff that overlooks 
   the ocean. Brigitte, who is wearing a skimpy bikini (With smiling 
   cats imprinted on it. I'm sure Freud would have a lot to say about 
   it!), asks Paul about Christian, Paul telling her that when Christian 
   was a boy, he had a nervous breakdown, Paul finding him passed-out 
   outside the mirrored bedroom. As a boy and a teenager, Christian 
   spent time in a mental institution, but he told no one what happened 
   on that fateful day. Brigitte asks Paul if Christian is dangerous and 
   Paul replies, &quot;I hope not.&quot; Later in the day, Christian 
   hears music coming from his favorite childhood toy, a Jiminy Cricket 
   wind-up spinning ceramic figurine, and he goes to investigate. When 
   he opens the door, he discovers his father's rocking chair seemingly 
   rocking on its own and on a table next to it is his father's favorite 
   pipe, still smoking, as if someone was using it. We then discover 
   that Brigitte is a cocktease, coming on to Christian, but when he 
   asks her why she married such an &quot;old fogey&quot;, she gets 
   defensive and walks away in a huff. During a thunderstorm that night, 
   Christian sees someone dressed as his father when he looks out a 
   window. He grabs Eileen, telling her what he saw, so they both go 
   outside, but find nothing. Christian wonders if Paul is trying to 
   drive him mad, but Eileen tells him to stop being ridiculous, Paul 
   has been a &quot;father&quot; to him ever since his real father 
   passed away. We then discover that something is going on between Paul 
   and Eileen, Paul telling her that they must &quot;act quickly&quot;. 
   Just what is going on?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next morning, Paul and Eileen go to town together in Paul's car. 
   Something Brigitte mentions to Christian in passing, makes him jump 
   in his car and try to follow them. He finds Paul's car parked next to 
   a hotel, waiting for hours in his car (a taking a pistol out of his 
   glove box) until Paul and Eileen exit the hotel. When hee sees Eileen 
   putting her arms around Paul and kissing him, Christian drives home 
   and begins to choke Brigitte with his bare hands as she lays on a bed 
   in the mirrored room. Paul enters and a fight ensues, Christian 
   pulling the pistol on him. He accuses Paul of trying to drive him 
   crazy so he will inherit his father's fortune. He even accuses Paul 
   of marrying Brigitte because she looks just like the woman his father 
   murdered. He then calls Eileen a &quot;whore&quot;, telling her that 
   he saw her and Paul exiting the hotel. Eileen can't take it any more 
   and tells Christian that she and Paul went to the hotel to talk to 
   his psychiatrist, Dr. Berge. When Christian asks Eileen why they had 
   to talk to his doctor, she removes a scarf from her head revealing a 
   couple of deep gashes on her face, telling Christian that he did that 
   to her last night. Christian lowers the gun, telling Eileen that he 
   has no memory of doing it. She tells him that ever since he came to 
   this house, he would enter her bedroom at night with a wild look on 
   his face and he behaved &quot;horribly&quot;, but he would have no 
   memory of it the next morning. She told Paul what was happening and 
   they thought it was best not to say anything until they talked to his 
   doctor, who is coming to the house tomorrow. Christian tries to shoot 
   himself in the head, but Paul grabs the gun in the nick of time, 
   Christian collapsing and passing out from exhaustion. The next 
   morning, Paul drives to the hotel to pick up Dr. Berge, but he's not 
   there. When Paul calls the doctor's office, he discovers something 
   that will change the course of everyone's lives. Think you know what 
   it is?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When Christian wakes up, he discovers Eileen's semi-nude body lying 
   on the floor, bloody and dead. Did he have one of his episodes and 
   kill Eileen? Or is there another explanation? Since this is a 
   four-character play and one of them is dead, you may think you know 
   the answer, but you'd be wrong! When Brigitte discovers what 
   Christian has done, she locks him in his bedroom, while Paul races 
   back to the house. Paul then discovers why the rocking chair 
   seemingly moves by itself (it's quite ingenious) and he starts 
   putting the pieces together. But will he survive the day? What are 
   the killer's motivations? Let me just say that nothing is as it seems 
   (it surprised me and I am not easily surprised) and money is a deadly 
   motivation. Oh, and the sins of the father can be repeated by the 
   son, but for different reasons (The ending it totally apt, in a 
   twisted sort of way).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    You would think that a film with only four characters would have 
   some boring stretches, but you would be wrong. It is surprisingly 
   adult in its approach, something unusual for a film made in this time 
   period, especially a genre film. This is also Ernesto Gastaldi's 
   first film as a director, co-directing and co-writing it with Vittorio<A HREF="libido_1965.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/libido 1965 italy poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Salerno (<B><A HREF="no_the_case_is_happily_resolved_1973.htm">NO, 
   THE CASE IS HAPPILY RESOLVED</A></B> - 1973), both taking the 
   singular directorial pseudonym &quot;Julian Berry Storf&quot; 
   (Gastaldi using &quot;Julian Berry&quot; and Salerno using 
   &quot;Victor Storff&quot; as screenwriters, based on a story from 
   Gastaldi's wife Mara). This is a quick moving film with excellent 
   performances all around (Much later, Giannini would spill his guts 
   [literally!] to Hannibal &quot;The Cannibal&quot; Lechter in <B><A HREF="hannibal_2001.htm">HANNIBAL</A></B> 
   - 2001) and a conclusion you will never see coming. It surprises me 
   that Gastaldi (who is still alive at the time of this review and has 
   been married to Mara since 1960) only directed five films during his 
   career, as he works wonders here with what has to be a very low 
   budget. Supposedly made in 18 days on a bet, it doesn't look it, as 
   the sequences shot in the house, especially in the mirrored room, are 
   shot with a visual flair not usually seen in low budget genre films. 
   The lush black and white photography, by Romolo Garroni (listed in 
   the credits as &quot;Romy Garron&quot;), also belies the low budget. 
   While there is no nudity or extreme violence here, some scenes are 
   daring for its time, especially Eileen's death and the nihilistic, 
   unexpected ending (once you see it, you'll know what I mean). 
   Recommended to me by a friend across the pond (Thanks, Steven!), I 
   enjoyed this slice of supreme retribution and if you're a fan of 
   obscure giallo flicks, you are certain to enjoy this one, which is as 
   rare as they come. Never available theatrically or on home video in 
   any format in the United States, the only way to see it is on YouTube 
   (Search &quot;Libido1965&quot;), who offer a serviceable widescreen 
   print in its original Italian with non-removable English subtitles. 
   Ever since I installed YouTube on my Roku 3, the site has been 
   getting quite a workout from me, because it is the only way to see 
   these obscure films. Believe me when I say that you can find nearly 
   anything there (Except for my Holy Grail, <B><A HREF="voodoo_heartbeat_1972.htm">VOODOO
    HEARTBEAT</A></B> - 1972!). While I know that black and white films 
   are not in &quot;fashion&quot; (One of my friends refuses to watch 
   black and white film because, and I quote, &quot;Real life is not in 
   black and white!&quot;. I really need to get better friends!), I wish 
   some daring company would license these rarely-seen films so those of 
   us who appreciate them can see them remastered. I can dream, can't I? 
   Gastaldi and Salerno would later join forces and co-direct the

    up to the casket, is aroused sexually (you can see it in her face, 
   especially her eyes) and gives the bearded corpse (played by the 
   film's director, but more on him later) a lingering kiss on the lips 
   that doesn't go unnoticed by funeral director Fred McSweeney (Timothy 
   Scott; <B><A HREF="farmer_1977.htm">THE FARMER</A></B> - 1977). We 
   next see Fred picking up street hustler Billy-Jo (I. William Quinn), 
   paying him twenty-five dollars for sex and then telling him that he 
   is married and will have to do the deed where he works (He tells 
   Billy-Jo that he is a veterinarian!). Billy-Jo strips naked 
   (surprisingly full frontal naked shots) and lays on a metal table, 
   where he complains that it is cold. Before he can do anything, Fred 
   straps Billy-Jo to the table, sticks a huge needle in his arm to 
   drain him of his blood, cuts his neck with a scalpel and embalms him 
   alive (This scene is very effective, as Billy-Jo pleads for his life 
   over-and-over as he slowly dies.). Fred belongs to a necrophilia cult 
   and plans to use Billy-Jo's embalmed body for their naked 
   sex-with-the-dead ritual. Fred also wants Lindsay to join in with 
   them, but that will have to wait a while. Lindsay throws a party at 
   her house, where we meet Wade Farrow (the late Christopher Stone; <B><A HREF="howling_1981.htm">THE

   that teddy bear) and tries to make love to her, but she is so 
   turned-off by the thought of making love to a man with a pulse that 
   she scratches his face. He leaves and she goes back to the party. The 
   next time we see Lindsay, she looking at the funeral notices in the 
   local newspaper and finds a new corpse for her to visit. She waits 
   for everyone to leave and then tries to kiss the corpse, only to 
   discover that his nose has been reconstructed with putty, which makes 
   her scream and run away, directly into the arms of the deceased's

   performance here). Alex looks strikingly like Lindsay's dead father, 
   which stirs something inside her, enough for her to check him out 
   with binoculars at his brother's burial and peeping at him through 
   his art gallery front window before running away when he notices her. 
   When Lindsay goes to her next funeral, she is approached by Fred, who 
   tells her that he knows what she likes (He says, &quot;It's called 
   necrophilia!&quot;) and he will be contacting her by letter when his 
   cult has their next ritual. Lindsay forgives Wade for his attempted 
   rape and asks him to accompany her to an opening at Alex's art 
   gallery. Before you know it, Lindsay ends up with Alex and Wade hooks 
   up with a female patron at the gallery and all four of them have 
   dinner together at a restaurant (this whole sequence is done without 
   dialogue, just a love ballad titled &quot;You're Something 
   Special&quot;, sung by Kit Fuller [who also sings the title tune], 
   playing on the soundtrack). Alex discovers early on that Lindsay 
   doesn't like to be touched sexually, but he proposes marriage, 
   thinking she will change her mind once they are wed. She accepts and 
   they get married, but Alex soon finds out that she still can't stand 
   to be touched and ends up sleeping in a separate bedroom until she 
   changes her mind. Lindsay gets her first letter from Fred and decides 
   to go to the funeral home at midnight, but her car is seen by Wade, 
   who is on a pay phone trying to make a late night visit to another 
   girl (yet he still has feelings for Lindsay), and he follows her to 
   the funeral home. Fred sees that Lindsay is not ready for a communal 
   necroplilia session, so he offers her some one-on-one time with a 
   dead body. Wade enters the funeral home and begins searching for 
   Lindsay, only to run into one of Fred's fellow ritual colleagues 
   (Louis Joeffred), who stabs Wade through the stomach with a huge 
   embalming needle, killing him. Lindsay screams, but Fred and his 
   ritual cult use Wade's strung-up body for one of their naked 
   necrophilia parties (this entire sequence is so well done, it's 
   nightmareish). Meanwhile, Alex becomes more and more concerned by 
   Lindsay's lack of sexual feelings for him and when he intercepts one 
   of Fred's registered letters to Lindsay, he decides to act on it and 
   discover the truth. He gives Lindsay the letter (he never opens it) 
   and waits outside in his car to see what she is up to. He follows her 
   to the funeral home and discovers her making love to a naked corpse. 
   He is repulsed, but before he can do anything, Fred stabs him to 
   death and embalms him. He<A HREF="love_me_deadly_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/love me deadly dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="154" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   transports Alex's embalmed corpse to Lindsay's house and puts him in 
   her bed. Now she can make love to Alex all she wants, as we learn the 
   truth on how Lindsay's father actually died.&nbsp; While the subject 
   matter may seem tasteless to most people, first and only time 
   director/writer Jacques LaCerte (from 1977 through 1981, he was a 
   Drama and English instructor at Inglewood High School in Inglewood, 
   CA. and passed away at age 60 in 1988) manages to make the film a lot 
   more classier than most films that would later deal with the subject 
   of necrophilia, especially director Jorg Buttgereit's highly 
   over-rated <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Nekromantik">NEKROMANTIK</A></B> 
   (1987). There is a sheen of professionalism on display here, 
   something highly unusual for a film from a first-time director. The 
   editing (by Leo Shreve; <B><A HREF="queen_of_blood_1966.htm">QUEEN OF BLOOD</A></B> 
   - 1966) of some of the scenes is extremely effective, especially the 
   intercutting of a young Lindsay with her father and a grown Lindsay 
   with Alex. The entire sequence of Wade's death and the cult's use of 
   his naked body is also one of the film's editorial highlights (You'll 
   know what I mean once you see it with your own eyes). While there is 
   some gore and blood (the bright red kind used in most of the 
   early-70's horror films), the film doesn't revel in it and it doesn't 
   need to because of the subject matter. Mary Wilcox is absolutely 
   convincing here, especially the way her face looks when she sees a 
   dead body. The real surprise is Lyle Waggoner, who is as good as he 
   would ever get. One wonders if Carol Burnett ever saw this film or 
   even knows about it (If she did at the time, would he even be one of 
   her sidekicks of her highly popular TV series?). All-in-all, <B><A HREF="love_me_deadly_1972_campus_corpse_1977_dvd.htm">LOVE

   - 1978) tells a group of village mercenaries that he will pay them 
   handsomely if they raid a caravan of nuns, telling them to bring back 
   the monk and a few nuns to him alive. They attack the caravan, 
   killing and raping nuns and doing what Albino asked of them. We then 
   see the monk and three nuns in the village square, being accused of 
   witchcraft and of consorting with the Devil (One villager yells to 
   the monk, &quot;You don't look horny now!&quot;). The monk has his 
   hand chopped off, stripped naked and then tar-and-feathered, while a 
   crowd of villagers laugh and applaud. He is forced to run through the 
   village while people chase him (and eventually kill him). The nuns 
   are burned alive at the stake, with one burning nun cursing the 
   village and everyone in it to a fate worse than death. The villagers 
   don't realize that they are already living that life, as anyone can 
   point at them and call them a witch and, just like the nuns, be 
   killed without even a fair trial. They are living in a time of mass 
   hysteria, where death is preferrable to the treatment they will 
   receive. An on-screen scrawl and narrator announces: &quot;<B>This 
   motion picture shows three cases taken from authentic documents from 
   the time when witch-hunting had reached its peak&nbsp; and can only 
   give a slight idea of the cruelties of one of the blackest pages in

    Barmaid Vanessa Benedikt (Olivera Vuco; <B><A HREF="ann_and_eve_1970.htm">ANN

   Meruh (Udo Kier; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#FallDownDead07">FALL

   Cumberland&nbsp; will be arriving in town soon and it is his job to 
   rid this village of all witches. Albino complains, saying he is this 
   village's Witchfinder General, but Christian has a document proving 
   otherwise (but Albino can't read!). Before he leaves the bar, Albino 
   makes a lewd remark about Vanessa (He saw her and Christian making 
   eye contact). Later on, Albino comes back to the bar and puts the 
   moves on Vanessa. The following conversation takes place: <B>Vanessa:</B> 
   &quot;I don't sleep with pigs!&quot; <B>Albino:</B> &quot;I could 
   denounce you as a witch!&quot; <B>Vanessa:</B> &quot;It's the only 
   way you can get women!&quot; Albino then forces himself on Vanessa, 
   but she runs out to the bar and screams that Albino is trying to rape 
   her. Albino appears and accuses Vanessa of being a witch, pulling out 
   his &quot;witch detector&quot; (A sharp needle with a handle, 
   resembling an icepick) and sticks it into a mole on her face and then 
   her back, saying Vanessa must be a witch because she doesn't scream, 
   but Vanessa is simply a strong woman. Christian accuses Albino of 
   lying and proves that Albino's advocate (Johannes Buzalski) made up 
   the charges on Albino's orders. he has Jeff whip Albino in the bar 
   for all to see. Big mistake. Christian and Vanessa soon become 
   lovers, but their happiness will be short-lived.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Lord Cumberland (Herbert Lom; <B><A HREF="dorian_gray_1970.htm">THE 
   SECRET OF DORIAN GRAY</A></B> - 1970; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Sect1991">THE
    SECT</A></B> - 1991) arrives and we learn that Christian studied 
   under him for three years. Albino has his advocate write-up charges 
   on Vanessa for being a witch. Lord Cumberland holds court and it 
   looks like he is a reasonable man, as he releases one innocent woman 
   on charges of being a witch, but that changes rather quickly. He 
   sentences the next woman, Deidre von Bergenstein (Gaby Fuchs; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Werewolf Shadow">WEREWOLF
    SHADOW</A></B> - 1970), to be stretched on the rack until she admits 
   that her baby is the Devil's (She was actually raped by a Bishop). 
   Then Vanessa is brought before Cumberland. Albino's advocate reads a 
   list of made-up charges against her and Cumberland sentences her to 
   prison, where she is to be tortured until she confesses. Christian 
   tells Lord Cumberland that she is innocent, but he replies, 
   &quot;She's beautiful, I'll give you that, but she's a witch!&quot; 
   Walter, a nobleman (Adrian Hoven; the director of <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#CastleCreepFlesh68">CASTLE
    OF THE CREEPING FLESH</A></B> [1968] and <B><A HREF="long_swift_sword_of_siegfried_1971.htm">THE
    LONG SWIFT SWORD OF SIEGFRIED</A></B> [1971]), is accused of being a 
   sorcerer and Cumberland tells him that if he turns his fortunes and 
   the deeds to his lands over to the Church, he will find him not 
   guilty. Walter's answer is spitting in Cumberland's face. We then see 
   Walter's wife (Ingeborg Sch&ouml;ner) being tortured, first with 
   thumbscrews and then on the rack, where she is stretched and has the 
   bottom of her feet branded with an iron poker. She will suffer much 
   more before she dies, as will her husband, who is slowly being 
   tortured with drops of water hitting his forehead 
   (drip...drip...drip...), slowly driving him mad (The film breaks 
   every so often to show how the water torture affects Walter. It's not 
   pretty.). Diedre says to Cumberland, &quot;I have nothing to confess. 
   I thank you for your mercy. May God have mercy on your soul.&quot;, 
   but Cumberland does not want to put her to death yet because, &quot;I 
   want confessions, not corpses!&quot; The poor woman is then put 
   through the worse torture of them all. She has her tongue ripped out 
   (A scene that had many audience members leaving the theater I was at 
   [The Colonial Theater in Pompton Lakes, NJ, where I saw many horror 
   films during my childhood]). When Albino is walking down the street, 
   he sees a nude woman in her bedroom window. He then breaks into her 
   house and rapes her. It's the only way this ugly man can have a 
   woman. It's either be raped by him or be accused of being a witch.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Lord Cumberland relieves Albino of his duties and we he protests, 
   calling Cumberland &quot;impotent&quot;, Cumberland strangles him 
   with his bare hands (A very effective scene, for what happens in the 
   background, as a brass plate rattles against the ground like a hubcap 
   and stops rattling when Albino dies.). Christian sees his teacher 
   kill Albino and is taken aback, finally realizing that all this witch 
   stuff is just a power play. How can a so-called religious man so 
   callously kill a man? Lord Cumberland steps up the violence, killing 
   Diedre by burning her alive (it's hard to scream when you have no 
   tongue). he also makes Walter sit on a chair of nails while a fire 
   burns beneath him. Things get really out of hand, especially when a 
   puppeteer is accused of consorting with the Devil by Albino's 
   advocate (You really have to hear his accusations towards the 
   puppets!). The puppeteer's wife stabs the advocate in the eye with 
   Albino's witch detector. Will this madness never end? Will Christian 
   and Vanessa live happily ever after? We have yet to see the 
   &quot;Spanish Boot&quot; (Google it) or other painful torture devices 
   being used, as well as a very nihilistic ending, where no one lives 
   happily ever after.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This was strong stuff back in the day and, quite frankly, it is 
   still strong today. Not for the violence and torture but, rather, for 
   how innocent people fall under the spell of absolute power over life 
   and death. This was also my first taste of Udo Kier, who is horribly 
   dubbed here, but I didn't know how Kier spoke until I saw him in <B><A HREF="andy_warhols_frankenstein_1973.htm">ANDY
    WARHOL'S FRANKENSTEIN</A></B> &amp; <B><A HREF="andy_warhols_dracula_1973.htm">DRACULA</A></B> 
   (both 1973). At least Herbert Lom dubbed his own voice, because in 
   1971 (when I saw this film) I already knew what he sounded like. He 
   is quite good here as a basically honest man who allows himself to 
   cross over to the dark side, where being devoutly religious meant 
   being a murderer. But the film clearly belongs to Reggie Nalder. I, 
   and countless others, wanted to know as much as possible about him 
   (his face was like a skull covered in tight, burned skin) but, since 
   this was before the internet, we had to make do with his other 
   performances, especially the TV films <B><A HREF="dead_dont_die_1974.htm">THE
    DEAD DON'T DIE</A></B> (1974) and <B><A HREF="salems_lot_1979.htm">SALEM'S
    LOT</A></B> (1979), where he excelled at being evil. This film is 
   quite relevant today, where one man's lies and deceitfulness are 
   accepted by<A HREF="mark_of_the_devil_1970_german_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mark of the devil german pressbook page 1 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="218" HEIGHT="306" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   the masses, no questions asked. But just like most disappointed 
   masses, they strike at even the innocent when the quilty ones can't 
   be touched, just like in this film where the villagers kill Christian 
   when Lord Cumberland realizes that the villagers want blood and he 
   successfully escapes. They string up Christian by his hands and put a 
   nutcraker-like device around his waist, sending metal spikes into his 
   body. The sad music, by Michael Holm (<B><A HREF="hobo_with_a_shotgun_2011.htm">HOBO
    WITH A SHOTGUN</A></B> - 2011), enhances the film's desperate tone, 
   as director/co-screenwriter Michael Armstrong (<B><A HREF="horror_house_1969.htm">HORROR
    HOUSE</A></B> - 1969; <B><A HREF="screamtime_1983.htm">SCREAMTIME</A></B> 
   - 1983, using the pseudonym &quot;Al Beresford&quot;), with an 
   uncredited assist from producer/co-screenwriter/actor Adrian Hoven 
   (who directed the unrelated sequel, <B><A HREF="mark_of_the_devil_part_2_1973.htm">MARK
    OF THE DEVIL PART II</A></B> [1973], featuring many of the same 
   actors here, but in different roles), fills the film with ungodly 
   torture, both physical and mental (I am a firm believer that mental 
   torture is so much worse than physical torture. Physical pain goes 
   away. Mental torture is hard to get rid of.). Armstrong wanted to end 
   the film with a supernatural finale, where the dead rise from their 
   graves and surround Christian, but Hoven, who took over directing the 
   film, filmed the ending we have all seen, which I think works far 
   better (Supernatural themes have no place in this movie). Armstrong 
   actually filmed his ending, which Hoven reportedly burned. All that 
   exists of Armstrong's footage are photographs, some of which are 
   shown in the German lobbycards for the film.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    NAME IS BRUCE</A><A NAME="MyNameIsBruce"></A> (2006) -</B> Bruce 
   Campbell, who also directed, has fun lampooning his image in this 
   amiable horror comedy. The small mining town of Gold Lick (whose 
   population is either 333 or 339, depending on what sign you read) is 
   besieged by a Chinese demon called Guan-Di (James J. Peck), when 
   Bruce Campbell-loving teen Jeff (Taylor Sharpe) wakes it up from a 
   long-dormant sleep after removing a protective medallion from the 
   entrance of an old mining shaft where the demon was being held 
   captive. Jeff manages to escape, but his three teen friends don't 
   fare too well, as Guan-Di dismembers and beheads them with his trusty 
   staff sword. We are then introduced to Bruce Campbell the 
   (fictitious) actor, who is in the middle of starring in <B>CAVE 
   ALIENS 2</B> and is considered an insufferable wanker by cast and 
   crew alike (So much so, that when he orders crewmember Tiny [Adam 
   Boyd] to fetch him a lemon water, he grabs an empty bottle out of the 
   garbage, pisses in it, hands it to Bruce, only to have Bruce complain 
   that it's too warm, but he drinks it anyway!). Bruce's boorish 
   behavior knows no bounds, whether it's handing one of his rabid fans 
   a stick of deodorant (&quot;Here, you know how to use this?&quot;), 
   pushing a paraplegic's wheelchair away with his foot or demanding 
   free a free lap dance in a strip club (he is flatly refused). Bruce's 
   personal and professional lives are a complete mess. He's recently 
   divorced from wife Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss; Campbell's<A HREF="my_name_is_bruce_2006b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/my name is bruce dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="207" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   co-star in <B><A HREF="evil_dead_1983.htm">THE EVIL DEAD</A></B> - 
   1983), is an alcoholic (he drinks so much, even his dog is a drunk!), 
   drives a junker car and lives in a dilapidated trailer (Things are so 
   bad, he drinks the alcohol in his dog's dish when he discovers that 
   there is no booze left in the trailer. It's a laugh-out-loud scene.). 
   When Jeff shows up at his trailer door at 4:30 in the morning and 
   begs him to come to Gold Lick to help the citizens fight Guan-Di (who 
   we find out is the Chinese patron saint of bean curd!), Bruce thinks 
   Jeff is pitching an idea for a new film and slams the door in Jeff's 
   face. Jeff ends up knocking-out Bruce with a baseball bat, throwing 
   him in the trunk of his car and driving him to Gold Lick, where Bruce 
   is welcomed as a hero by the Mayor (Ben McCain, who along with 
   brother Butch McCain [as &quot;The McCain Brothers&quot;], interrupt 
   the film a few times to play guitar and sing the song &quot;The 
   Legend Of Guan-Di&quot;, whose lyrics keep the audience up-to-date 
   with the proceedings) and the entire Gold Lick population, who are 
   dwindling in number and losing their heads to Guan-Di's sword. Bruce 
   thinks the whole situation is a low-budget film shoot; a birthday 
   present set-up by his agent Mills (Ted Raimi; <B><A HREF="skinner_1995.htm">SKINNER</A></B> 
   - 1993), so he plays along, thinking everything that is happening is 
   nothing but an elaborate joke to bolster his fragile ego (Little does 
   he know that Mills is fucking his ex-wife!). Bruce begins falling for 
   local girl Kelly Graham (Grace Thorsen), Jeff's divorced mother, 
   still not realizing that his life is actually in mortal danger. As 
   the film progresses, Bruce begins to actually do some good (after a 
   particularly cowardly start) and slowly gains back his humility and 
   humanity. Only Kelly seems to realize that Bruce is not taking the 
   situation as seriously as he should, but she play along for the good 
   of the town and finds herself falling for Bruce's charms. The finale 
   finds Bruce, Kelly and Jeff facing Guan-Di alone, armed only with 
   bean curd, some Campbell movie memorabilia and a few sticks of 
   dynamite.&nbsp; This reverential comedy has some laugh-out-loud 
   moments and some spot-on dialogue (When the entire town interrupts 
   his first kiss with Kelly, Campbell screams out, &quot;For the love 
   of God, I can smell her Chapstick!&quot;), but a lot of it will go 
   over the heads of those who never heard or are not fans of Campbell. 
   It also makes some poignant statements about the state of celebrity 
   and fandom in the world today, but not at the expense of either the 
   celebrities or the fans. Bruce Campbell has a field day parodying his 
   image and Mark Verheiden's screenplay spares no Campbell film from 
   some very sharp barbs (When Campbell carjacks an old lady's car while 
   retreating Gold Lick in a cowardly moment, the old lady screams at 
   him, &quot;You were the worst thing about <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Moontrap1988">MOONTRAP</A></B>!&quot;).
    There are some laugh-till-you-cry moments on view here, such as the 
   miniature angel and devil on Campbell's shoulders debating him 
   returning to Gold Lick (both angel and devil portrayed by Campbell in 
   the appropriate costumes) or the director of <B>CAVE ALIENS 2</B> 
   replacing an absent Campbell with a stunt dummy and no one notices! 
   Campbell does a grand job as actor and director (much better than he 
   did with <B><A HREF="man_with_the_screaming_brain_2005.htm">THE MAN 
   WITH THE SCREAMING BRAIN</A></B> - 2005), making <B><A HREF="my_name_is_bruce_2006b.htm">MY
    NAME IS BRUCE</A></B> a rare treat: A horror comedy that actually 
   delivers the goods. It's funny, gory and moves at a brisk clip. Ted 
   Raimi plays three roles here: Mills the agent; Ted the sign painter 
   (who keeps changing the population number on Gold Lick's welcome sign 
   as Guan-Di dispatches the townspeople); and Wing, a Chinaman who 
   warns the town of their impending doom. Two of them have their heads 
   cut off. Be sure to stick around during the closing credits to see 
   The McCain Brothers get their long overdue comeuppance. Also starring

   bleeds into a bigfoot's footprint. Yes folks, this is the only 
   bigfoot gore film to see if your taste is<A HREF="night_of_the_demon_1979.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/night of the demon 1980 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   for bloody, atrociuosly-acted and badly-plotted flicks about a 
   sasquatch with a grudge. After discovering a newly discovered reel of 
   film which purportedly shows a bigfoot, Professor Nugent (Michael J. 
   Cutt) and five of his students go on a field trip to the area where 
   the film was found (the photographer was never found), in hopes of 
   finding proof that bigfoot does exist. They begin by asking the 
   townspeople for some info and learn about Crazy Wanda (Melanie 
   Graham), a woman who lives deep in the woods and may have some kind 
   of connection to the bigfoot. After learning some background info 
   about Crazy Wanda and a sect of inbred religious fanatics who live in 
   the forest, our stupid group of need-to-know-it-alls decide to trek 
   through the woods and look for them. Meanwhile, bigfoot is going on a 
   tear, savagely butchering a naked couple screwing in a van, killing a 
   camper in a sleeping bag by swinging him wildly overhead and impaling 
   him on a tree branch and, in the film's highlight, yanking the penis 
   off a biker when he stops to take a leak. Our thirsty for knowledge 
   sextet break up a ritual being performed by the fanatics and have 
   their boat stolen, which is their only way to return to civilization. 
   Instead of being worried like normal people would, they decide to 
   stick with their plan and try to locate Crazy Wanda. Professor 
   Nugent's wife, Susan (Lynn Eastman), is having terrible nightmares 
   back home, where she dreams of her husband having his throat torn out 
   by the bigfoot (this does not lead anywhere later on in the film). 
   After one of the student is mauled on the back by the bigfoot (he 
   survives), they find Crazy Wanda's house and notice that all her 
   windows have bars on them. Wanda lets them in (after the Professor 
   gives her a cinnamon stick), but all she does is sit in her rocking 
   chair and stare at a locked room. The Professor then tells his 
   students a couple more horror stories about the bigfoot: He kills a 
   guy chopping wood with his own axe by planting it in his shoulder and 
   he kills two knife-wielding Girl Scouts (!) by grabbing their arms 
   and making them stab each other. Why the Professor decides to tell 
   his students such horrific stories at this point only the 
   screenwriter (Mike Williams) can say. It is finally that time in the 
   movie for our six heroes to face the bigfoot and it turns out that it 
   may not be<A HREF="night_of_the_demon_1979c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/night of the demon 1980 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="127" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   a bigfoot after all (OK, it's half-bigfoot), just Crazy Wanda's son 
   who was born malformed years earlier after she was raped by a real 
   bigfoot and her preacher father made her drink poison to try to abort 
   the baby. It didn't work and, boy, is he one pissed-off individual. 
   In a finale that can best be described as surreal, bigfoot traps and 
   kills all the students in Wanda's house, each proceeding kill getting 
   gorier and gorier (it's also hilarious, as each student just stands 
   there waiting for their turn to be slaughtered) until only the 
   Professor is left (barely alive). Did I forget to mention that this 
   entire sequence is shot in super slo-mo?&nbsp; I just love <B><A HREF="night_of_the_demon_1979e.htm">NIGHT
    OF THE DEMON</A></B>, even though everything in it is just plain 
   wrong and politically incorrect, not to mention piss-poor technically 
   in every department. This film wallows in the gore and director James 
   C. Wasson (who, regrettably, never made anything else) linger on the 
   red stuff lovingly, some would say a little too long for comfort. The 
   crank-yanking scene and the finale are particularly juicy as a man is 
   beaten to death with his own intestines and the Professor has his 
   face forced down on a hot stove until his flesh stretches like string 
   cheese when pulled away. These aren't top-of-the-line special 
   effects, but they are rather unnerving. It's also filled with a lot 
   of &quot;What The Fuck!?!?&quot; moments, like the rocking chair cam, 
   the student who takes photos while he is being attacked and Girl 
   Scouts carrying big-ass knives (I'm sure the GS didn't OK this). The 
   acting is generally poor but, surprisingly, hardly hurts this film at 
   all, as you will probably sitting there slack-jawed at the frequent 
   bloody visuals on view (and I'm not exagerrating, this is one bloody 
   film). The only piece of &quot;acting&quot; that was noticable was 
   when one of the female students, seeing that their boat is missing, 
   says, &quot;Oh my God, my God! What are we going to do?&quot; like 
   she was reading it off of cue cards for the first time. This is one 
   of those films where everything should fail but, somehow, it all gels 
   together for a wildly outrageous experience which words (such as 
   these) cannot begin to describe. This gets my highest recommendation.

    OF THE LEPUS</A><A NAME="Night Of The Lepus"></A> (1972) -</B> Let 
   me preface this review by stating the following: This has to be the 
   silliest horror film ever financed by a major studio (MGM). Anyone 
   who thinks giant bunny rabbits are scary should have their heads 
   examined. That said, this film is one of my favorite guilty 
   pleasures, for all the wrong reasons, of course. When Rancher Cole 
   (Rory Calhoune) loses his best horse when it breaks it's leg in a 
   rabbit hole, that is the last straw, as the overabundance of wild 
   rabbits have destroyed most of Cole's grazing land for his cattle. 
   Fed up, Cole goes to the university to look up old friend Professor 
   Elgin Clark (DeForest Kelley) for some help in getting rid of the 
   rabbits. Elgin recommends Roy and Gerry Bennett (Stuart Whitman and 
   Janet Leigh), two ecologists who have solved similar problems with 
   wolves. The <A HREF="night_of_the_lepus_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/night of the lepus dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="227" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Bennetts
    take back a dozen rabbits to their lab and treat half of them with 
   an experimental hormone, hoping to disrupt the rabbits' reproductive 
   cycle. The treated rabbits were never supposed to be released back to 
   the wild (the hormone is still untested), but that's just what 
   happens when the Bennett's young daughter Amanda (Melanie Fullerton) 
   switches an untreated rabbit with a treated one and accidentally sets 
   it free to join the other wild rabbits. Pretty soon after, giant 
   rabbits (&quot;The size of wolves!&quot;) are killing the populace, 
   leaving mangled bodies in their wake. Roy, Gerry, Elgin and Cole find 
   the giant bunnies' hiding spot (in an abandoned mine) and blow it up 
   with dynamite. But, since rabbits are burrowing animals, they escape, 
   so our group has to come up with another way to destroy them. Maybe 
   electricity will work? Ah, good old electricity. A giant monster's 
   worst enemy.&nbsp; This film works best as an unintentional comedy. 
   The sight of normal size adorable bunnies running around in slow 
   motion on miniature sets should bring a smile to everyone's lips. But 
   the truly laugh-out-loud moments come from the attack scenes, as 
   hordes of confused rabbits run around with fake blood smeared on 
   their furry faces, the camera closing in on their buck-toothed mouths 
   while grunts and growls of what sound like dobermans wail on the 
   soundtrack. Let's not forget the awful full-size rabbit suits worn by 
   some hapless extras that are on view whenever a human is attacked. 
   Surprisingly, director William F. Claxton (who was mainly a director 
   of episodic TV until his death in 1996) plays everything super 
   seriously and it is very bloody for a PG rated film.&nbsp; There's 
   bloody shots of mutilated kids, adults and rabbits (who are 
   mercilessly hit with red paintballs whenever cast members fire 
   rifles, shotguns or machineguns at them) and the attacks on humans 
   are especially bloody. It's that bright red blood that was used in a 
   lot of early 70's horror films. It's not the least bit believable, 
   but it sure does look good on screen. I was surprised that the cast 
   of pros were able to keep a straight face throughout this entire 
   ridiculous film, but they do. Personally, I would have fired my 
   agent, but appearing in this didn't seem to do too much damage to 
   their careers. Besides, I wouldn't trade the sight of giant bunnies 
   running down a highway and jumping over the camera in slow-motion for 
   anything in the world. Am I glad this film was made? Hell, yes! Long 
   sought after by collectors and traded for years on the grey market in 
   terrible third generation dupes (usually with Dutch subtitles),

   - 2016), but none are more terrifying than the one in the film I am 
   about to review. This clown will blow your mind (literally) with his 
   non-stop slaughtering and doing it without uttering a single word, so 
   there are no wisecracks like in other killer clown movies. Even 
   though this ultra-low-budget horror film was once harder to find than 
   a funny bit in a Carrot Top comedy routine, it is now available in an 
   &quot;Extended Director's Cut&quot;, which adds a lot more gore and a 
   little more exposition to give the characters some extra backbone in 
   the extra 7 minutes. The film begins in a bleak-looking room, where 
   Gurdy The Clown (Jack Amos) is applying his makeup while the camera 
   pans around his room, showing us all types of creepy clown 
   paraphenalia and then a bloodied girl tied-up on a mattress on the 
   floor. Instead of Gurdy killing the girl, a shot rings out, blood 
   splatters on the camera lens and it looks like Gurdy committed 
   suicide (This scene is pivital to the entire film, which made me even 
   enjoy the film more after it was over). We then switch to a week 
   earlier, where tabloid reporters Jennifer Stevenson (Georgia Chris) 
   and Mark Webb (screenwriter &amp; producer Joe Davison) decide to 
   change from exploitative fictional stories to something real and 
   focus on a serial killer case where the killer is known as &quot;The 
   Teardrop Killer&quot; and try to do research on what makes a serial 
   killer tick. Meanwhile, at a halfway house where Gurdy the Clown is a 
   resident, he suddenly turns extremely violent, as he slices up a 
   black resident's face over-and-over with a big-ass meat cleaver (his 
   weapon of choice) and then cleaves another resident's head in two 
   while he is watching TV (both deaths are gory beyond belief and are 
   more realistic than the deaths shown in big-budget films). Gurdy then 
   gets into a fight with the halfway house's cook (the blooper reel on 
   the DVD shows that the meat cleaver is not a prop, as it puts a huge 
   hole into a steel pot!) and, after a short fight, he cuts off the 
   cook's head with the cleaver (another extremely effective gory 
   death). When an intern hears the commotion, Gurdy slices open his 
   back with the cleaver, spurting blood all over a wall. Another intern 
   runs for her life, only for Gurdy to stomp her head to a bloody pulp 
   and then he turns his attention to a wheelchair-bound resident, who 
   can't escape because there are a large set of stairs blocking her 
   way. Gurdy decapitates her and then pushes her wheelchair and 
   headless body down the flight of stairs (Man, this is a great way to 
   start a horror film!). Jennifer does some research on the internet on 
   the Teardrop Killer and discovers that at every murder site there 
   were traces of greasepaint. Gurdy continues his killing spree at the 
   halfway house, trapping a woman in the bathroom and disemboweling 
   her, her intestines falling to the floor (his cleaver has many uses), 
   slicing another male resident by nearly cutting him in half from the 
   crotch-up (Ouch!) and then snapping the janitor's neck before 
   escaping the halfway house. Jennifer's FBI sister (who we never see), 
   sends her a text message on her phone telling her about the brutal 
   slayings at the halfway house, so she and Mark go there to see if 
   they can get inside (The New Mexico license plate on Mark's car reads 
   &quot;ROUTE66&quot;). Lucky for them that Detective Duncan (Rod 
   Grant; and yes his name is a reference to Dunkin Donuts) is at the 
   murder scene, as he has a crush on Jennifer and lets them inside to 
   videotape what is left of the carnage (the coroner has already taken 
   the bodies away but, according to Det. Duncan, two people are still 
   missing and unaccounted for), but Mark finds the cook's head in the 
   oven and as our investigating team are taking a tour of the halfway 
   house, they find a living little girl. They bring her outside to a 
   surprised Det. Duncan, where the little girl cries, &quot;He was 
   killing everyone!&quot; We then see that Gurdy has tied a young woman 
   to a wooden table, both of her legs missing below the knees (her 
   character's name is identified as &quot;Legs McPhinney&quot;, played 
   by Alanna Baker), screaming to her boyfriend Jeff (actor unknown, but 
   his hands are tied behind his back and there's a noose around his 
   neck) that &quot;my legs are cold!&quot;. Gurdy tortures Jeff for a 
   little while and then makes him watch as he suffocates his girlfriend 
   and then kills Jeff with the cleaver. Young woman Christine (Raine 
   Brown) is headed out for a night on the town with her girlfriends 
   (Her mother tells her she is &quot;dressed like a clown&quot; [Clue 
   alert!]) while Gurdy kills a mechanic with his own portable circular 
   saw, cutting open his stomach and playing with his intestines, which 
   he pulls out slowly and puts in a bucket. For good measure, he cuts 
   off the mechanic's head with the cleaver. Christine is actually alone 
   in a dive bar, then gets oral sex from some male patron in the alley 
   (she also like to cut herself with a straight-razor) and generally 
   acts like a degenerate. Jennifer and Mark deduce by the pattern of 
   the killings throughout the years that the Teardrop Killer, could be 
   a carny or possibly a clown in a traveling circus, but is the 
   Teardrop Killer actually Gurdy or someone else? All of what I 
   described has happened in the first 30 minutes of the film, so there 
   is so much more bloodshed ond plot developments on view for the next 
   67 minutes (such as the guy who was performing cunnilingus on 
   Christine is found sliced to death in the alley), that this review 
   could go on forever describing every kill and the fine points on what 
   makes Gurdy tick. Besides the very realistic gore effects (done by 
   the director and his crew), you will see such sights as Jennifer and 
   Mark getting into a footchase with a midget named Drago (Norberto 
   Santiago), who knows more than he is willing to say, learn much more 
   about the mysterious Christine and even why Gurdy spares Drago's 
   life. You will also see a man get his feet chopped off, another man 
   gets his arms chopped off and still another man being cut in half, 
   his innards spilling onto the sidewalk, as Jennifer and Mark get 
   closer and closer to the truth that it becomes fatal to one of them. 
   We also learn from Drago that Gurdy's real name is &quot;Luther 
   Edward Baxter&quot; (Why do most serial killers have three names, 
   even the real-life ones?) and he once worked at the same circus Drago 
   did. There are actually two serial killers on the loose, but are they 
   connected in any way? I won't tell, but I have given you enough clues 
   to draw your own conclusions.&nbsp; For such a low-budget film, it is 
   chock-full of wall-to-wall unrated gore, a really decent plot (where 
   the &quot;suicide&quot; at the beginning is explained in a very 
   satisfying way) and not the normal bad acting you usually see in 
   films with budgets like this. <A HREF="100_tears_2007.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/100 tears dvd reverse cover6 front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="213" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Director

    7</A></B> [2009] and <B><A HREF="frost_bite_2011.htm">FROST BITE</A></B> 
   [2011]) turns in a really good script full of funny one-liners (most 
   of which he reserves for his character), but don't mistaken this film 
   for a comedy in any way. Most of the funny stuff are throw-away lines 
   of dialogue which you have to pay attention to appreciate and there 
   is an actual story here between the frequent gore scenes (This film 
   has a prediliction for showing human intestines as, besides the kills 
   I have already described, there is another guy who gets impaled with 
   the curved end of a crowbar, his intestines being pulled out and then 
   being strangled with them! There are so many intestines on display, a 
   sausage factory would be jealous.). You will also see nearly every 
   human appendage being chopped off, watch as a human eyeball is bitten 
   out of the head of a living victim and watch in amazement as a living 
   human body is reduced to a pile of bloody mush as it is repeatedly 
   hit with the cleaver and a sledgehammer. Nearly every way you can see 
   a person killed (even with a gun, because one does come into play in 
   an important scene) is shown on-screen without hiding anything, which 
   will have gorehounds squealing with delight. I have seen my fair 
   share of gory films, but I have not seen a film start with so much 
   gore and keep it coming throughout 97 minutes than I have with this 
   film. What's also even more amazing is this is a gore film with 
   characters you actually care about, very rare for a film of this 
   type. Sometimes the film's low-budget roots show, such as in some 
   scenes where fake grain was added in-camera to give it a more 
   &quot;grindhouse&quot; look, but you won't mind because of all the 
   amazing kills on view and how the film wraps itself up nicely at the 
   end. There is some clunky, inappropriate music in some scenes, but 
   don't let that deter you from one of the bloodiest experiences you 
   are bound to have in a long, long time. I can't recommend this film 
   enough and the ending will bring a big, sadistic smile to your face. 
   Make sure you stay through the end credits (the last few lines are a 
   howl!), for a final stinger. Originally released on a limited edition 
   DVD in 2008, which sold out quickly and was next to impossible to 
   find anywhere, but the fine folks at Unearthed Films and MVD Visual 
   released a longer Director's Cut on DVD in 2014 (with a reversable 
   cover), which contains the same extras as on the original DVD. along 
   with new ones. I especially liked the funny outtake reel (I'm a 
   sucker for those!), where things go wrong and people act like idiots 
   (There's one outtake where Mark is pelted by debris as he is on his 
   back and suddenly a big round aluminum vent falls on him, something 
   that wasn't planned. Thankfully, he wasn't hurt and laughed about 
   it.). Ted Geoghegan, who was screenwriter on such gore films as <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Barricade2006">BARRICADE</A></B>

    excellent action/sci-fi story concerning two aliens, one good, 
   Townshend (Lance Edwards), and one a serial killer, Yates (the always 
   excellent Robert Forster), battling it out on Earth. With the help of 
   coroner Dr. Dori Caisson (Hilary Shepard, who sees about 20 bullet 
   wounds disappear on Townshend after a fight with the police), the 
   good alien (who is a cop on his home planet) try to track down and 
   kill the bad alien and also retrieve the black keycard to his 
   spaceship, which he lost during the scuffle with the police. His ship 
   is in the ocean and he needs to get into it before the tide washes it 
   out the sea. The only problem is, is that the Yates is tracking him, 
   along with a detective (Robert Davi) who thinks that Dori is being 
   held captive. The aliens can take as many hits to the body as 
   possible and survive. It just takes some time to regenerate (as when 
   Yates rips his hand off to escape a pair of handcuffs). The only way 
   to kill them is to put a bullet in their brainpan, whereby they 
   disintegrate within 20 seconds. Filmed on a low budget, this is still 
   good old-fashioned nail-biting stuff as director Tenney films the 
   frequent chase and fight scenes with verve and a sense of urgency. 
   The film also has a good sense of humor as when Townshend learns 
   English overnight by watching TV and Dori's interrogation by the 
   detectives when she tries to explain that both men they saw were 
   aliens. (She also says to one of the detectives: &quot;The only 
   difference between a brown-noser and a shithead is depth 
   perception.&quot;) When Yates kidnaps Dori to trap and kill 
   Townshend, the story takes a shocking turn. In a surprise twist, none 
   of the aliens turn out who you think they are as Yates tells Dori 
   that he is a Peacemaker, the real good guy and he has been on Earth 
   for 20 years, sent to this planet as a intergalatic relocation 
   program. He tells Dori that there are hundreds like him on Earth and 
   that Townshend was sent here to kill one of the relocators. As a 
   matter of fact, the rest of the film is full of twists and turns and 
   action-packed. Nobody turns out to be who they say they are. Director 
   Kevin S. Tenney has never done better. He has made some pretty good 
   films (<B><A HREF="witchboard_1986.htm">WITCHBOARD</A></B> - 1986; <B><A HREF="night_of_the_demons_1988.htm">NIGHT

   version some sixteen years later, when<A HREF="phenomena_1984.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/phenomena italy poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Anchor Bay Entertainment released it &quot;uncut&quot; (it wasn't) 
   and in widescreen on VHS and DVD in 1999, still thinking that Argento 
   lost his patented &quot;touch&quot;, beginning with this film and 
   continuing with all the other films he directed in the '80s &amp; 
   '90s. He still had flashes of brilliance, but I found his later films 
   bitterly disappointing, like he was trying way too hard to impress 
   audiences and failing miserably. I purposely put Argento's films on 
   moratorium after watching this film again back in the beginning of 
   the New Millennium and held off reviewing any of his films on this 
   site, with the exception of <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#MotherOfTears">MOTHER
    OF TEARS</A></B> (2007) and <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Terror Opera">[TERROR
    AT THE] OPERA</A></B> (1987), both of which I found exceptional. 
   Since I have been doing nothing but reviewing Italian and European 
   genre films for the past year, I decided to re-watch some Argento 
   films for the first time in over two decades, beginning with this 
   film, but I don't know if my brain has changed or my criteria on what 
   makes a good film has differed, because I was somewhat impressed with 
   this film, only with some minor caveats. For one thing, Argento's 
   choice of music (by Iron Maiden, Motorhead, Andi Sex Gang and Franky 
   Goes To Hollywood) is off-putting and seems to go against the grain 
   of what he was trying to convey (contrasting Simon Boswell &amp; 
   Goblin's eerie, evocative score). It's like Argento was playing to 
   the stoner teen crowd in order to put asses in the seats, but when I 
   went to see this film on opening day, the theater was nearly empty 
   and there was nary a stoned teen to be seen. Another caveat is that 
   people in the film do the most stupid things possible at the worst 
   possible times, merely to advance the plot. If you can put up with 
   loud head-banging music and stupid people, you should have a good 
   time with this film. After this long-winded introduction, let's get 
   to the film itself.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   somewhere in the outskirts of Switzerland. She walks for miles and 
   finds a seemingly abandoned house, only it isn't because someone or 
   something is chained to a wall and we see it break free. After having 
   her hand pinned to a wall with scissors, the Dutch girl screams and 
   runs away into a tunnel system near a steep waterfall (perfect for 
   one of Argento's patented &quot;one take, no edits&quot; Steadicam 
   sequences), where the killer stabs the girl in the stomach with the 
   scissors and pushes her head through a plate of glass (in super

   arrives in Switzerland to attend the Richard Wagner School For Girls, 
   an exclusive academy for the daughters of the elite. Jennifer is 
   different from all the other girls, as we see in her first scene, 
   where she is in a chauffeur-driven limousine with Frau Bruckner 
   (Daria Nicolodi; Argento's <B><A HREF="#Inferno1980">INFERNO</A></B>

   school for the first day, a bee flies into the limo and Frau Bruckner 
   and the chauffeur go to kill it, but Jennifer stops them, the bee 
   flying into her open hand. Jennifer tells them the bee will not sting 
   her and it doesn't, as we see Jennifer stroking the bee with one of 
   her fingers, telling Frau Bruckner that she loves insects and they 
   love her back. Once at the school, Jennifer meets her new roommate 
   Sophie (Federica Mastroianni) and the very strict nameless 
   headmistress (Dalila Di Lazzaro; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Frankenstein 80">FRANKENSTEIN
    '80</A></B> - 1972) takes away Jennifer's poster of her father, 
   saying such things aren't allowed in school, not even in her dorm 
   room. That night, Jennifer has a nightmare and sleepwalks out of her 
   dorm room and walks aimlessly outside, going in no particular 
   direction. She is then picked up by two German students, who try to 
   rape her in their car, but she manages to jump out of the moving car 
   and rolls down an embankment into the forest.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Jennifer then wakes up, but she has no idea where she is. Inga then 
   appears, takes Jennifer's hand and leads her to the Professor's 
   house. The Professor notices that Jennifer has a strange effect on 
   insects (all of his insects, which he keeps in glass cages, begin to 
   buzz and make other noises very loudly), especially when a 
   &quot;spitting beetle&quot; begins secreting a sweet smelling liquid 
   when Jennifer holds it, meaning that it wants to mate with her. Since 
   it is nowhere near the beetle's mating season, the Professor knows 
   that Jennifer is an exceptional girl and she confesses that she has 
   always been able to summon insects and they always come to her rescue 
   when she is in trouble. The Professor tells Jennifer that many 
   species of insects are able to use telepathy to communicate with 
   other insects vast distances away and Jennifer is special because she 
   also has that power. He asks her why she is out so late, but Jennifer 
   tells him she can't remember much because she was sleepwalking and 
   all she can recall is that two boys tried to sexually assault her, 
   but she couldn't wake herself up. The Professor tells her she is 
   always welcome to come to his house and gives her Greta's jacket to 
   keep her warm, telling her that the next time she sleepwalks, she 
   must say to herself, &quot;I am sleepwalking. I must wake up.&quot; 
   She then leaves his home and walks back to the school, where the 
   headmistress is pissed, telling Jennifer that no one leaves her 
   school at night and makes her get an EEG of her brainwaves, calling 
   her an epileptic (!) and if she doesn't suffer from epilepsy, she 
   must be crazy! Jennifer has had enough of the headmistress' bullshit 
   and rips the electrodes off her head and storms out of the room, 
   making Sophie promise to watch her at night so she doesn't sleepwalk.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    That night, instead of watching Jennifer, Sophie meets her boyfriend 
   on the school grounds. When her boyfriend leaves, Sophie is attacked 
   and murdered by the serial killer, who uses a long metal pole with a 
   sharp blade on one end to impale Sophie in the back of her skull, the 
   blade exiting out of her mouth. Jennifer hears Sophie's screams and 
   goes outside, where a single firefly leads her to a woolen glove 
   hanging from a tree branch. Jennifer then goes back to her room and 
   screams, waking up the rest of the school. The schoolgirls are 
   relentless in their mocking of Jennifer, especially when one girl 
   steals a letter Jennifer wrote to her father, explaining her power 
   over insects, which she reads to the headmistress (she calls Jennifer 
   &quot;crazy&quot; and a Devil worshipper, saying the name 
   &quot;Beelzebub&quot; is Latin for &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, 
   referring to Jennifer as &quot;Lady of the Flies&quot;! This 
   headmistress is a piece of work.). The students taunt Jennifer 
   relentlessly, saying over and over, &quot;Call to your insects! We 
   worship you!&quot; Suddenly, all the windows in the school are coated 
   with winged insects, so thick that it turns the inside of the <A HREF="phenomena_1984.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/creepers aka phenomena poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>school
    pitch black, scaring both students and teachers alike. Then they 
   just as suddenly disappear in a large swarm that blocks the sun in 
   the sky. Jennifer then gives the woolen glove to the Professor, the 
   only person she now trusts. The inside of the glove contains maggots 
   and larvae of the &quot;Master Sarcophagous Fly&quot;, an insect that 
   only appears on dead flesh. Now fully understanding Jennifer's power 
   with insects, the Professor comes up with the idea of pairing 
   Jennifer with a Sarcophagous fly, the fly leading her to the location 
   where the serial killer lives, the Professor believing that the 
   killer keeps the rotting corpses of the victims close by (so he can 
   &quot;play&quot; with them), hence the appearance of the larvae 
   inside the glove. The Professor also believes that the killer lives 
   within a fifty-two kilometer area, since the first victim (the Danish 
   student) and every one after that were on the same route as the tour bus.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    That night, while Inga is outside taking her nightly stroll, the 
   door to the Professor's house slams shut and locks, leaving Inga 
   outside with no way to get in. Knowing that the Professor's life is 
   in danger, Inga starts screaming and begins tearing away the wooden 
   slats covering one of the windows. The Professor hears the commotion 
   and, thinking that Inga has locked herself out, he puts himself and 
   his wheelchair on the electric stair climber and heads downstairs, 
   only when he gets to the bottom, the killer stabs him in the stomach 
   with the spear-like metal pole, killing him. Inga witnesses the whole 
   thing and lets out a heart-breaking yelp (For those that don't 
   believe man evolved from the apes, I suggest that you watch this 
   scene. It will change your mind.). Inga then aimlessly walks through 
   the forest and hunger forces her to forage through garbage cans, 
   where she finds a straight razor...</FONT></FONT><BR>

    who has left the school for good, vowing to never go back, hops on 
   the tour bus with a single Sarcophagous fly in a glass cage and 
   watches it closely as the bus travels its 52 kilometer route. The fly 
   starts buzzing loudly at one location and she makes the driver stop 
   the bus so she can get off, not noticing that the bus was being 
   followed by a car as soon as Jennifer stepped on the bus and became a 
   passenger. Jennifer lets the fly out of the cage and follows it, the 
   car silently following Jennifer. The fly leads Jennifer to the house 
   the Dutch girl found in the beginning of the film. Jennifer find the 
   room where the killer was chained-up, but before she can discover 
   anything else, a real estate broker comes into the house and wants to 
   know why she is there because no one has live in the house for eight 
   months. Jennifer leaves the house and we then discover that the car 
   following her was being driven by Police Inspector Geiger, who 
   questions the broker, wanting to know who lived in the house 
   previously (information the audience is not privy to). Jennifer, who

   goes there, the bank teller saying that no transfer in her name has

   to have Frau Bruckner show up, saying that Morris Shapiro phoned her

    Jennifer agrees and Frau Bruckner drives Jennifer to her home, which 
   surprises Jennifer because her house is so huge. She asks Frau 
   Bruckner how long she has lived in the house and she replies eight 
   months (uh, oh!). Once in the house, Jennifer notices that all of the 
   mirrors are covered with sheets, Frau Bruckner telling her that her 
   nameless son suffers from Patau Syndrome (a real malady that causes 
   severe deformation of the face) and he can't stand looking at 
   himself. Jennifer uses the bathroom to wash up and discovers that the 
   soap and towels are covered in Sarcophagous fly larvae and quickly 
   puts two and two together. She tries to phone the police, but Frau 
   Bruckner hits Jennifer on the back of her head with a blunt object, 
   rips the phone cord out of the wall and places the phone in the next 
   room. When Frau Bruckner sees the Inspector's car pull into the 
   driveway, she knocks out Jennifer to stop her from yelling for help, 
   flicks a switch on the wall which drops heavy sheets of metal on all 
   the windows, making the room inescapable and locks the door behind 
   her. Jennifer wakes up when she hears an ear-piercing scream and 
   tries to escape the room, but fails. Knowing that the phone is in an 
   adjoining room, Jennifer crawls through a window above the door, 
   plugs the phone in and makes a call to the police, but another scream 
   causes her to drop the phone, which falls through a hole in the floor 
   (that is covered in Sarcophagous fly larvae). Rather than pulling the 
   phone up by the cord, Jennifer crawls into the hole (I told you that 
   people do stupid things in this film, didn't I?) to retrieve the 
   phone, but she ends up falling into a pit filled with the remains of 
   decaying bodies, which can best be described as a pool of putrefied 
   flesh stew (which will give your gag reflex a good workout!). Next to 
   the pit is Inspector Geiger, who is chained to a wall. As Jennifer 
   escapes the pit of rotting body parts, Frau Bruckner appears and 
   tries to kill her, but Inspector Geiger (who we saw break his thumb 
   to escape his shackles) grabs Frau Bruckner. Jennifer escapes and 
   runs into a room where a young boy is sitting in a corner, telling 
   Jennifer to go away, as she doesn't belong here. Jennifer tries to 
   comfort the boy (once again doing something very stupid), but when he 
   turns around, she discovers he has the face of a monster. Yes, it is 
   Frau Bruckner's son and he tries to kill Jennifer, but she escapes 
   into a tunnel that leads outside to a dock by a lake. Jennifer 
   quickly hops in a motorboat, but she is not quick enough, because the 
   monstrous boy jumps into the boat with his spear-like weapon and 
   tries to kill Jennifer with it but misses, piercing a plastic 
   container of gasoline. Suddenly, a swarm of insects cover the boy, 
   eating away the flesh on his grotesque face and he falls into the 
   lake (Don't fuck with a girl who can summon insects!). Jennifer 
   starts the boat's motor, only for it to ignite the gasoline, turning 
   the boat and the water around it into a fiery inferno. Jennifer jumps 
   into the lake and holds her breath, swimming away from the 
   gasoline-soaked water, only the boy is not quite dead yet. He grabs 
   Jennifer and a struggle ensues, where the boy surfaces and burns to 
   death. Jennifer swims to shore and believes her ordeal is over. 
   Morris Shapiro appears, telling Jennifer that he flew to Switzerland 
   to personally accompany her home, but he doesn't get the chance. A 
   piece of sheet metal, swung by Frau Bruckner, decapitates Morris 
   (Quite shocking, one of the best jump scares I have ever seen on 
   film). Frau Bruckner then holds the piece of sheet metal to 
   Jennifer's throat, telling her that she killed Sophie and the 
   Professor to &quot;protect&quot; her son, also telling Jennifer that 
   she is about to die, so she should call her insect friends one last 
   time, only they will not be able to protect her, they will see her 
   die. Inga then appears, slashing Frau Bruckner about her face and 
   throat with the straight razor, killing her in retribution for 
   murdering her beloved Professor. The nightmare is finally over.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    If you can look past people doing the most insane things at the most 
   inopportune times (such as Jennifer crawling into a maggot-infested 
   hole to retrieve the phone, when all she had to do is pull the phone 
   up by the cord) and the headache-inducing heavy metal music playing 
   during scenes that run contrary to the music being played (Hey, I

   advance the plot or set a mood), you may find yourself enjoying this 
   film. Be aware that the 82-minute version, titled <B>CREEPERS</B> 
   (released by New Line Cinema to <A HREF="phenomena_1984.htm#CreepersPoster">theaters</A> 
   and on <A HREF="phenomena_1984.htm#CreepersVHS">VHS</A> from <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Media Home Ent.">Media
    Home Entertainment</A>), is an abomination, missing over 30 minutes 
   of footage, and excises some important exposition that is needed to 
   make sense of the story. It also edits some of the more graphic 
   violence so we don't see the &quot;money shot&quot; on any of the 
   murders. Even the Anchor Bay <A HREF="phenomena_1984.htm#AnchorBayDVD">DVD</A>,
    which runs 110 minutes, is missing a few key scenes, including the 
   Danish girl being impaled in the hand with scissors, Sophie being 
   stabbed in the back of her head with the blade exiting out of her 
   mouth and Inspector Geiger breaking his thumb to escape his 
   handcuffs. Thankfully, the Synapse Films <A HREF="phenomena_1984.htm#SynapseBlu-Ray">Blu-Ray</A> 
   and the streaming version on Amazon Prime (free to Prime members) 
   offer the full 116-minute version, which is the way this film should 
   be viewed (Arrow Films also issued a four-disc &quot;Limited 
   Edition&quot; <A HREF="phenomena_1984.htm#ArrowVideoBlu-Ray">Blu-Ray</A> 
   of this title, but it is way too expensive for the likes of me.). 
   This is purportedly Dario Argento's favorite film of his oeuvre, 
   since it contains many aspects from his own personal history, 
   especially the story Jennifer tells Sophie about her mother (missing 
   from most prints), which actually happened to Argento. This film also 
   contains many of Argento's patented flourishes, including the 
   aforementioned single-take Steadicam tracking footage, death by glass 
   and other strange sights, done with a sense of imagination and 
   professionalism as only Argento can deliver. I am really glad I 
   decided to revisit this film, because it gave me the impetus to 
   explore Argento's other films, from the beginning of his directorial 
   career (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BirdCrystalPlum1970">THE BIRD WITH 
   THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE</A></B> - 1970), right up to his most recent 
   film, <B><A HREF="dracula_3d_2012.htm">DRACULA 3D</A></B> (2012; at 
   the time of this review). I will sporadically be posting reviews of 
   most of his films, as I am finding myself discovering something new 
   every time I re-watch them. Argento is one of the few directors from 
   the Golden Age of Italian genre Cinema still working today. There's a 
   reason for that, as even his most recent films, while not 
   masterpieces, show a certain brilliance missing from most films 
   today. Luigi Cozzi&nbsp; (director of <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#KillerMustKillAgain">THE

   months ago, he was in a terrible car accident in London and lost his

   &quot;Peter Smith&quot;. Peter tries to get on with his life, but he

   takes Philip to his apartment and as soon as they walk through the 
   door, Philip punches Ted in the face, pulling a gun on him and saying 
   that it is time to stop pretending, he wants the item he hid that's 
   worth a million dollars. Ted tells him he is not faking, he really 
   lost his memory eight months ago, Philip telling him if he doesn't 
   give up the location of the goods, he will shoot him and then his 
   wife, who lives in Portofino, Italy. When Ted tells him he has no 
   idea what he is talking about, Philip tries to pull the trigger, but 
   a bullet flies through one of the windows and hits Philip in the 
   back, killing him. There's a knock on the door and it's a telegram 
   delivery from a woman named Sara, who tells him to come to Portofino, 
   giving him a time, location and a date. Ted puts Philip's body in the 
   hide-a-bed and closes it, leaves his apartment and is told by the 
   lobby desk that he has a letter. When Ted opens it, there's a plane 
   ticket to Rome and a train ticket to Portofino. Ted doesn't know 
   this, but he is about to experience something that will make him 
   question who he really is. He will ask himself, &quot;Am I a killer 
   or is this a case of mistaken identity?&quot; After all, he had a 
   passport on him at the time of the accident and nothing has been able 
   to get him remember who he really is. That's about to change.

    The film then switches to Sara (Senta Berger; <B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#DiabolicalYours1967">DIABOLLICALLY
    YOURS</A></B> - 1967), who works as a swimming instructor to 
   children at an indoor pool at a youth center in Portofino. Her 
   neighbor, ten-year-old Luca (Duilio Cruciani; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#SyndicateSadists75">SYNDICATE
    SADISTS</A></B> - 1975), is one of her students who has a severe 
   crush on her and takes her picture as much as possible with the 
   camera that's always hanging around his neck (Luca is also wise 
   beyond his years). The sports doctor at the youth center, Daniele 
   Reinhart (Umberto Orsini; <B><A HREF="smiling_maniacs_1975.htm">SMILING
    MANIACS</A></B> - 1975), also has a severe crush on Sara, driving 
   her to and from her home and hoping a romance will develop, but Sara 
   would rather their relationship remains as good friends only. One 
   night, Sara is attacked from behind in her home and chloroformed, 
   waking up with her home in complete disarray, yet nothing was taken. 
   She tells the policeman (Rosario Borelli; <B><A HREF="death_rage_1976.htm">DEATH
    RAGE</A></B> - 1976) that this wasn't the first time that her home 
   was ransacked and nothing taken and they both come to the conclusion 
   that it's hooligans out for a thrill who are responsible. They don't 
   know haw wrong they are. And why does Sara have a chainsaw in one of 
   her kitchen cabinets (we learn later that the handyman uses it to cut 
   firewood)? When Sara gets a telegram from Ted, stating that he will 
   be arriving in Portofino by train today, Sara seems upset, but she 
   tells Reinhart that she needs to meet her husband alone. Her life is 
   also about to change. Drastically and violently.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When the train arrives and Ted gets off, he walks up the stairs and 
   passes Sara whithout recognizing her, but a sniffling hood named 
   George (a fantastic Bruno Corazzari; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#KillerWoreGloves74">THE
    KILLER WORE GLOVES</A></B> - 1974; who is always wiping his nose 
   with a handkerchief) tells Ted that he just walked past his wife; 
   she's standing at the top of the stairs. Ted walks over to Sara and 
   tells her that he has no idea that she's his wife, as he has had 
   amnesia for the past eight months. Sara has a hard time believing 
   him, but invites Ted to her home (He mentions the telegram that Sara 
   sent him, but Sara says she didn't send him a telegram). Once there, 
   Sara tells Ted that they met in New York a little over a year ago and 
   were married in London only after a week of dating. Ted was always 
   secretive about what he did for a living, but she believes it had 
   something to do with antiques, showing Ted the expensive antique desk 
   clock he gave her as a present. He then disappeared a short time 
   later and Sara moved back to Portofino to get on with her life. When 
   Ted looks at the clock, a fragment of a memory comes back to him: a 
   man getting his throat cut with a stiletto knife while Ted stands 
   behind him. Sara can see that he is remembering something and begins 
   to believe his plight, telling him he can stay in the guest bedroom 
   until he decides what to do. When Ted watches Sara teach the children 
   at the pool, he is introduced to Reinhart, who seems to be a really 
   nice guy, accepting the fact that Sara now has a husband and 
   remaining friends with her and hopefully her husband. Ted sees George 
   watching him and runs to go meet him. George tells him if Ted doesn't 
   give him the location of the one million dollar shipment (fifteen 
   pounds of heroin stuffed inside sausage casings) in one week, he will 
   kill both him and Sara, because people above him are threatening his 
   life unless he delivers the heroin. To show how serious he is, he 
   cuts the throat of Sara's dog, Whiskey, and leaves it on her bed, 
   Sara screaming when she discovers the body (Later in the film, George 
   denies he killed Whiskey, saying he would never kill a dog. So who 
   did kill Whiskey? George does cop to sending Ted the telegram in 
   Sara's name.).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Ted sees George skulking around the outside of Sara's home, he 
   chases George, but loses him, only to run into a woman named Mary 
   Caine (Anita Strindberg; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WhoSawHerDie">WHO 
   SAW HER DIE?</A></B> - 1972), who kisses Ted on the lips like she 
   knows him. Meanwhile, George sneaks into Sara's home and confronts 
   her, telling Sara that if her husband doesn't deliver the goods in 
   five days, she is dead. Late that night, someone breaks into Sara's 
   home, waking her up. When she gets up to investigate, she discovers a 
   bloody stiletto sticking in the kitchen door, making Sara scream. 
   When Ted hears her screams and runs downstairs, he looks at the knife 
   (which is stained with Whiskey's blood) and has the<A HREF="puzzle_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("241","305") --><IMG SRC="images/puzzle 1974 dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="236" HEIGHT="299" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   same memory of the man getting his throat cut, only this time a 
   little more information is offered: the leader of the gang Ted 
   belonged to, only seen in silouette, is standing in front of the 
   clock Ted gave Sara. This is a clue that will later give Ted his full 
   memory back, but there's even more danger afoot. Sara agrees to go 
   back to New York with Ted, but it's obvious George doesn't want them 
   to leave without turning over the goods. While Sara is leaving the 
   youth center with Reinhart, she is hit by a car driven by Mary Caine. 
   Reinhart takes Mary's phone number and takes Sara to his office, 
   where he tells her that her leg is broken in two places, so he will 
   have to put a full leg cast on it. Sara is now on crutches and cannot 
   go to New York in two days, but Reinhart asks her when she does go to 
   New York with Ted, he would like to go along with them because he 
   needs a relaxing holiday. While Ted is away, Sara is once again paid 
   a visit by George, who pulls out a box of matches and begins flicking 
   lit ones in rapid succession on Sara as she is unable to escape (a 
   very nerve-wracking scene), thanks to the cast on her leg. While Sara 
   tries to put out the lit matches on her, George says he is serious 
   about getting the one million dollars in goods. If she doesn't get 
   Ted to tell her where they are, they are dead. He tells Sara to tell 
   Ted to meet him at the abandoned villa across the way. When Ted comes 
   home and discovers that this wasn't the first time George paid Sara a 
   visit, he goes to the abandoned villa and confronts George. They get 
   into a violent fistfight and George pulls out his gun and shoots Ted, 
   hitting him in the arm, but Ted knocks George over a wall, where he 
   falls down a cliff onto the rocks and ocean below. Then someone 
   knocks out Ted and hogties him inside the abandoned villa, saying he 
   will come back later to free or maybe kill him (we don't see who it 
   is because his face is covered by some ivy on the villa door).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Luca arrives at Sara's house with an album of photos he has taken of 
   her and Ted. One of the photos shows Ted with Mary Caine and Sara 
   gets very suspicious and calls Mary's car insurance company to see 
   where Mary lives, only to be told they have no customer named Mary 
   Caine. Sara thinks that is funny because she heard Reinhart talking 
   to Mary on the phone and he gave Sara the name of Mary's insurance 
   company and policy number. Sara begins having doubts about Reinhart 
   and even has doubts about her leg being broken since she feels no 
   pain. She begins cutting off the cast (with tin snips!) with Luca's 
   help and once it is off, she discovers the heroin in the sausage 
   casings inside the cast. Just as she discovers it, Reinhart knocks on 
   the door, so Sara and Luca try to hide the opened cast and she gives 
   the heroin to Luca and tells him to take it to his house and hide it 
   in one of his toys.&nbsp; She puts the heroin in a bag and Luca walks 
   out with it, as Reinhart enters the house and finds Sara sitting on a 
   chair with her legs covered by a blanket. Luca then arrives with a 
   toy truck and places it on the floor, Sara telling Luca to go home. 
   Reinhart sees Luca's photo album and begins to look through it, 
   stepping on a piece of the broken cast as he does so. He then rips 
   the blanket off Sara and pulls out a straight razor, saying he will 
   kill her unless she tells him where the heroin is. At first Sara 
   doesn't say anything until Reinhart viciously slashes Sara's palm and 
   arm with the straight razor. She then tells him the drugs are in the 
   toy truck and when Reinhart verifies it is true, he says to Sara that 
   he now has to kill her, slashing her across her back with the razor. 
   Sara runs to the kitchen, pulls out the chainsaw&nbsp; and tries to 
   start it, as Reinhart begins breaking down the locked kitchen door. 
   Just when it looks like Sara is dead meat, the chainsaw starts up and <A HREF="puzzle_1974.htm#ChainsawPhoto">Sara
    attacks Reinhart with it</A>, Reinhart using a chair to block the 
   spinning saw blade. Ted (who escaped from the abandoned villa in a 
   manner you will have to experience for yourself) then arrives and a 
   fight between him and Reinhart breaks out, ending with Reinhart 
   falling on the spinning blade of the chainsaw, which is lying on the 
   floor, disembowling him (I'm pretty sure, even back then, chainsaws 
   have a safety device that doesn't allow the chainsaw to work when the 
   trigger is not pressed, but just go along with it, as Reinhart died a 
   perfect death). The police then arrive (thanks to Luca) and Sara 
   tries to make excuses for Ted, but Ted won't allow her to, telling 
   the police that his memory has returned and he needs to tell them 
   everything, Sara looking at him and smiling. <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">THE

    QUIET PLACE TO KILL</A></B> - 1970) has a lot to recommend, be it 
   the acting by the more than capable cast, especially Bruno Corazzari 
   as George, who steals every scene he is in. Duilio Cruciani as Luca 
   is unlike any child portrayed on film. He's intelligent, has the 
   mouth of a truck driver and actually knows that nothing romantic is 
   going to happen between him and Sara, yet he calls her his 
   &quot;fiancee&quot; and really cares about her. All kids should be 
   portrayed like this, as he stands out here in his many scenes. The 
   story may have more than enough holes to make swiss cheese jealous 
   (why doesn't the sight of Reinhart set off memories in Ted, since he 
   was the head of Ted's gang?), but it is played so earnestly by the 
   cast, it's hard to find fault with the film. There's hardly any 
   nudity, just quick flashes of Senta Berger's breasts and ass when she 
   changes clothes or goes to bed (She sleeps naked. Everyone should!) 
   and the violence level is very tame until the film's final twenty 
   minutes (except for the sight of <A HREF="puzzle_1974.htm#WhiskeySlitThroat">Whiskey
    with his throat cut</A>, which is cut so deeply, his head is almost 
   separated from his body), when George plunges off the cliff (an 
   obvious dummy that hits its head on a rock as it plunges into the 
   ocean, yet it is still an effective scene since Corazzari is so 
   memorable as George) and Reinhart slashes Sara with the razor, which 
   is done so violently, it will make viewers upset because Reinhart was 
   a pretty nice guy <A HREF="puzzle_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("207","303") --><IMG SRC="images/puzzle 1974 italy poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="207" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>throughout
    the film, so when he dies by the chainsaw, it is a death deserving 
   of such a violent two-faced person (He's the one who slashed 
   Whiskey's throat. Anyone who could kill an animal so viciously gets 
   no remorse from me). I also like how Sara never has sex with Ted 
   because she is unsure of him. Is he telling the truth about his 
   memory loss or is he lying? Hell, she won't even allow him to kiss 
   her on the lips (When he tries, she turns her head away and he kisses 
   her on the cheek). It's little things like this that makes the film 
   so outstanding. In most other Giallo films, Sara would be fucking Ted 
   the first chance she gets, but not here, making the film more 
   realistic than most of its ilk. It also has a nice jazzy <A HREF="puzzle_1974.htm#OST">soundtrack</A> 
   by Gianni Ferrio (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#DeathWalksMidnite72">DEATH
    WALKS AT MIDNIGHT</A></B> - 1972) that will get your toes tapping 
   every now and then. This is a Giallo flick that is story-driven, not 
   depending on gore or sex, and it works. This one gets the highest 
   recommendation from me and all Giallo lovers are going to enjoy it.

   mentally-challenged actioner that contains plentiful nudity,

   action sequences ever committed to celluloid. Toss in one of the most 
   unbelievable, pretty-boy leading men in film history and what you 
   have is a total package of ineptitude. Matt Hannon (real name: Mathew 
   Karedas) stars as Detective Joe Marshall, a cop in L.A. (on loan from 
   San Diego) who speaks fluent Japanese (although we never hear him 
   speak a single word of it) and was<A HREF="samurai_cop_1989c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/samurai cop dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="227" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   somehow trained in the way of the Samurai (as a matter of fact, 
   &quot;Samurai&quot; is his nickname). Joe (who has hair down to his 
   shoulders, is irresistible to most women and has the emotional range 
   of a cucumber, like some mutant Fabio) teams up with L.A. detective 
   Frank (Mark Frazer) to bring down Japanese drug kingpin Fujiyama 
   (Joselito Rescober; and, yes, you read that correctly, a Spanish 
   actor playing a Japanese!). After catching one of Fujiyama's men 
   after a memorable car chase (where Joe repeatedly says to Frank, 
   &quot;Shoot! Shoot him!&quot;) and putting him in the hospital with 
   burns over 90% of his body (his van simply taps the side of a hill 
   and explodes!), Joe and Frank hope to get him to talk (!), but 
   Fujiyama sends his #1 muscle, Yamashita (Robert Z'Dar; yeah, you read 
   that correctly, too!) to cut the burned guy's head off so he can 
   &quot;place it on his piano&quot;. Yamashita does just that, sneaking 
   into the hospital room while hiding in a garbage can and cutting the 
   guy's head off with a Katana while he lies in bed, all bloodied and 
   bandaged. When Police Captain Roma (Jimmy Williams) finds out, he 
   nearly bursts a blood vessel (He says, &quot;I feel like somebody 
   stuck a big club up my ass...and it hurts! I've gotta figure out a 
   way to get it outta there!&quot;), but he gives Joe and Frank one 
   more chance to bring Fujiyama down. That &quot;one more chance&quot; 
   includes numerous fights, by sword (where one guy gets his arm sliced 
   off), gun and fist; a hilarious encounter with a gay Costa Rican 
   waiter; an invasion on henchman's Okamura's (Gerald Okamura) house, 
   where Joe and Okamura have one of the most badly choreographed 
   martial arts fights in memory (not to mention the constantly changing 
   location photography); and a visit from some New York hitmen. After 
   various attempts on Joe and Frank's lives, they kill Fujiyama, Joe 
   and Yamashita have a sword and fist duel (where Yamashita commits 
   hari-kari for losing face) and Joe falls in love with Fujiyama's new 
   girlfriend, Jenny (Janis Farley). Is that a tear in your eye? Here, 
   let me get you a tissue.&nbsp; I can't begin to explain how bad this 
   gem truly is. I don't think there's a second in this film where one 
   thing goes right, whether it the acting, editing, music, action 
   sequences or some of the poorest post-sync dubbing and sound effects 
   this side of a Doris Wishman film. Matt Hannon (who was once a 
   bodyguard for Sylvester Stallone) is so stiff and wooden as the 
   long-haired American Samurai, I was waiting for my TV set to start 
   spitting out splinters. Mark Frazer, as his black partner Frank, must 
   have studied acting from the Steppin Fetchit school of emoting, as 
   all he does is stare <A HREF="samurai_cop_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/samurai cop polish vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>bug-eyed
    into the camera in a series of reaction shots or talk about his 
   &quot;black ass&quot; or how big his dick is. He sets back the cause 
   of African American acting (not to mention Civil Rights) by at least 
   fifty years. Robert Z'Dar (<B><A HREF="maniac_cop_1988.htm">MANIAC COP</A></B> 
   - 1988; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EvilAltar">EVIL ALTAR</A></B> - 
   1989) covers-up his extraordinary big chin with a beard and proves 
   how mean he is by pouring a frying pan-full of bacon grease onto the 
   legs of nymphomaniac cop Peggy (Melissa Moore of <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Vampire Cop">VAMPIRE
    COP</A></B> [1990]) to get her to talk. Otherwise, his expression 
   never changes throughout the entire film. Director Shervan (who, at 
   one time, owned the majority of movie theaters in Iran) manages to 
   throw in as much nudity as possible (always a good thing), but the 
   entire film looks like it was shot and edited by someone with a 
   severe case of ADD, as it jumps from one scene to the next with no 
   establishing shots or connecting structure and contains gunfights 
   where it's plain to see that the weapons are nothing more than cap 
   pistols (in some scenes, you can actually hear the clicks of the 
   pistols where they forgot to overdub the sounds of actual gunfire) 
   and some of the most unbelievable dialogue I have ever heard. The 
   Police Captain gets the best lines, including where he incredulously 
   tells Joe and Frank to &quot;kill everyone&quot; and &quot;make sure 
   it's a bloodbath&quot; in the film's finale or the scene where he 
   tells Fujiyama's lawyer (who simply says to him, &quot;I'll see you 
   in court!&quot;), &quot;You motherfucker! I'll see you in Hell! Leave 
   me alone! Get a job!&quot; Wow. Who knew being a lawyer wasn't a job? 
   There's also a surreal scene between Joe and a hospital nurse that 
   must be heard and seen to be believed. I can't recommend this film 
   highly enough for all badfilm lovers. It's the best anti-action 
   action film you will ever see. Filmed in Los Angeles in 1989, but not 
   released until 1991. Joe Bob Briggs does his usual hilarious, biting 
   commentary on this film's DVD release from Media Blasters. The DVD 
   also contains a funny interview with co-star Robert Z'Dar (If his jaw 
   gets any bigger, it will have it's own gravitational orbit!), who 
   reminisces about this film, his life and his real-life romance with 
   co-star Krista Lane (here billed simply as &quot;Cameron&quot;), who 
   he swears ignorance to her porn star credits at the time, even though 
   his first filmed scene with her was a nude lovemaking bit in a bed 
   (which had to be reshot, after a bottle of wine, because she was too 
   &quot;stiff&quot;!). Great stuff. Unbelievably, followed by a sequel 
   in 2015, <B><A HREF="samurai_cop_2_deadly_vengeance_2015.htm">SAMURAI

   Crown International film has been floating around on stand-alone VHS 
   &amp; DVD compilations in a cut 86-minute R-Rated version, even in 
   U.S. theaters. I was never keen on the film because it seemed like 
   something was missing and I never really could pinpoint one character 
   in the film (turns out it was two characters; I'll explain in the 
   review) and why he did the things he did. Now, thanks to Walter Olsen 
   and Scorpion Releasing, we have a completely uncut version of the 
   film on widescreen anamorphic DVD with three minutes of excised 
   footage restored and it makes it seem like a different film. A better 
   film. Not only does the three minutes restore some nasty bits, 
   full-frontal female nudity (and lots of it!) and extend the gore 
   briefly shown shown in the R-Rated version and give us a previously 
   unseen death of a character, almost from the beginning it shows some 
   exposition about the character I was talking about. It gives us the<A HREF="satans_slave_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/satan's slave 1976 dvd7 front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="206" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   motivations of a sociopath. And since Norman J. Warren was the 
   director and David McGillivray the screenwriter (they worked together 
   again on the so-so <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Terror">TERROR</A></B> 
   - 1978), you know the film will be interesting in this incarnation 
   (McGillvray is better known for writing the screenplays to the films 
   of director Pete Walker, such as <B><A HREF="frightmare_1974.htm">FRIGHTMARE</A></B>

   - 1975; and <B><A HREF="schizo_1976.htm">SCHIZO</A></B> - 1976, which 
   were nearly all nasty indictments of the Catholic Church or the 
   British penal system disguised as horror films). The film begins with 
   a robed and goat mask-wearing Alexander Yorke (the unmistakenable 
   voice of Michael Gough; <B><A HREF="horror_hospital_1973.htm">HORROR HOSPITAL</A></B> 
   - 1973) and his group of hooded followers performing a Satanic mass, 
   where Alexander leads a young woman (which we later find out was his 
   wife) on to an altar and strips her naked (full-frontal nudity within 
   the first three minutes; whats not to love?). He calls her a 
   &quot;vessel of reversal&quot;, as the naked woman writhes in 
   pleasure and pain, with Alexander hoping some female spirit named 
   Camilla will enter his body because she was once a powerful witch. He 
   hopes this female sacrifice will be enough to entice her to enter his 
   body, so he will have all her powers, including immortality. The 
   woman sits up and screams and we are suddenly at a dinner with 
   Stephen Yorke (Martin Potter; <B><A HREF="goodbye_gemini_1970.htm">GOODBYE
    GEMINI</A></B> - 1970) and some unnamed young woman (played by Paula 
   Patterson). The young lady gets sleepy (Could Stephen have drugged 
   the wine?) and uses Stephen's bed to lay down, only to find Stephen 
   standing over her and putting a pillow over her face, knocking her 
   out. He then gags her, ties her hands behind her back and begins to 
   rape her, when he notices scissors on the night table. He picks them 
   up, cuts off her clothes and runs the scissors over her completely 
   naked body (there is a long scene of female pubic hair in this 
   scene), stopping the scissors at certain parts of her body (Will her 
   cut off one of her nipples? Will he shove the scissors up her 
   vagina?), before she breaks loose, running out of the room and 
   calling Stephen an &quot;animal&quot;. Stephen just lays on the bed 
   and laughs. The young woman tries to find a way to leave the mansion, 
   but Stephen slams a door against her head a few times, forcing blood 
   to come out of her ears and mouth. He finishes her off by stabbing 
   her repeatedly in the torso with a large knife and begins dragging 
   her body away on a rug, when a woman comes through the front door and 
   sees what he is doing (Only a fragment of this sequence exists on the 
   R-Rated version, the scissors sequence is completely missing and it 
   gives us a much better psychological profile of Stephen in the uncut 
   version.). We then switch to Catherine Yorke (Candace Glendenning; <B><A HREF="tower_of_evil_1972.htm">TOWER
    OF EVIL</A></B> [a.k.a. <B><A HREF="horror_on_snape_island_1972.htm">HORROR
    ON SNAPE ISLAND</A></B>; <B><A HREF="beyond_the_fog_1972.htm">BEYOND 
   THE FOG</A></B> - 1972]) and her boyfriend John (Michael Craze; <B><A HREF="madhouse_1974.htm">MADHOUSE</A></B> 
   - 1974) in bed. Catherine is rapidly approaching her 20th birthday 
   and she is going to spend it with her parents at her Uncle 
   Alexander's mansion for a week. She is also prone to premonitions and 
   feels that she needs to do this for some reason she cannot explain. 
   Before she leaves, John gives her an expensive silver bracelet that 
   once belonged to his mother as an early birthday present, since he 
   was not invited to go on the journey with her (it's family only). 
   Catherine and her parents make the 60-mile trip to Alexander's 
   mansion out somewhere in a secluded part of the country. As 
   Catherine's father is driving down the long driveway that leads to 
   Alexander's mansion, he hears a god-awful noise which makes him slam 
   the car against a tree. Catherine's mother is knocked unconscious, so 
   her father says he will stay with her while Catherine runs to the 
   mansion to call for an ambulance. Suddenly, for seemingly no reason, 
   the car bursts into flames and explodes, killing Catherine's parents. 
   As you can guess, Catherine is an emotional mess, but we know that 
   Uncle Alexander and Stephen have her just where they want her. 
   Alexander's secretary, Frances (Barbara Kellerman; <B><A HREF="monster_club_1980.htm">THE
    MONSTER CLUB</A></B> - 1980), who loves Stephen even though she 
   knows he is a sociopath (she was the woman that walked through the 
   door when Stephen was moving his first victim away), puts Catherine 
   to bed (after Alexander gives her some &quot;sleeping pills&quot;) 
   and takes care of her needs. She wakes up the next morning and 
   Stephen takes her on the tour of the grounds and Catherine learns 
   that Stephen lost his mother when she was just 29 years-old. She also 
   notices that her parents' car is missing (&quot;The police took 
   it.&quot; is Stephen's reply). Stephen says that he and his father 
   talked a lot about Catherine when they lived in Africa (if Africa has 
   any meaning in this film, it is lost on me). Catherine has a 
   premonition (it's actually a premonition flashback and flashforward) 
   where three Puritans tie a totally naked Camilla Yorke to a tree, 
   brand her a couple of times with a cross, whip her back until it is 
   bloody and raw and then Catherine sees herself being burned alive 
   like a witch (much of this scene is missing from the R-Rated cut). 
   When she comes out of her state, Stephen is nowhere to be found. 
   Catherine gets back to the mansion and sees Stephen reading on a 
   couch. When she asks him where he went, all he tells her are lies. 
   Catherine tells Uncle Alexander that she doesn't trust Stephen at all 
   and Alexander says Catherine is a wise young woman. He has been 
   cleaning Stephen's messes up since he was a child. Alexander insists 
   that Catherine's parents be buried at a small gathering at the family 
   cemetery on the mansion's grounds (In an ironic in-joke, David 
   McGillivray cameos as a priest). When everyone leaves, Catherine is 
   drawn to a headstone buried in the thicket with the name &quot;Camilla
    Yorke&quot; chiseled on it. While Catherine is asleep that night, 
   someone dressed in black, including black gloves, sneaks into her 
   bedroom (giving this sequence a giallo feel) and steals the silver 
   bracelet that John gave her as an early 20th birthday present. 
   Frances can't stand that Stephen has pushed her aside for Catherine, 
   so she sneaks into Alexander's study and unlocks a drawer to his 
   desk, stealing some important papers which we don't know what they 
   contain. Yet. John has not heard from Catherine in a few days and her 
   birthday is tomorrow, so he leaves his apartment and gets into the 
   elevator (probably to drive to Alexander's mansion), when he hears 
   that god-awful noise that Catherine's father heard before he crashed 
   the car (We can hear the name &quot;Asmodeus&quot; mentioned among 
   the noise. Asmodeus is constantly associated as being the Devil, but 
   it is actually one of the Seven Princes of Hell. He is the Prince of 
   Lust.). John non-chalantly takes the elevator to the roof of the 
   building and walks off it, the results being John's body torn to a 
   bloody pulp when he hits the pavement (This is the second character I 
   was talking about. In the R-Rated cut, we see John in the beginning 
   and then he just disappears. His death is certainly a gory shocker in 
   the Uncut version and is the first time in the U.S. that we see him 
   die.). Alexander keeps on giving Catherine &quot;sleeping pills&quot; 
   and this time she has a dream of laying on an altar completely naked, 
   while another woman draws a pentagram on her chest using a dagger and 
   human blood. Stephen kisses her naked body, she has blood and snakes 
   thrown on her body (Miss Clendenning insisted on a body double with 
   the snake scene, but the rest of the sequence is all her) while a 
   group of hooded Satanists watch the action. She awakens from the <A HREF="satans_slave_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/satan's slave 1976 poster10 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="294" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="4"></A>nightmare
    (or was it a premonition?) before she can be killed on the altar. 
   But what could all of this mean? I believe I have given you all the 
   clues you need to figure it out (there's also a betrayal by someone 
   very close to Catherine). Why are there no police questioning 
   Catherine? What are in the papers that Frances took and what happens 
   to her when Stephen finds out? Does Catherine escape or is she 
   sacrificed since it is her 20th birthday today? Since this comes from 
   the 70's, it could go either way.&nbsp; The extra three minutes add 
   greatly to the enjoyment of the film. I never liked the R-Rated 
   version, but this Unrated version gives us characterization, gore 
   (some of it really nasty, especially Stephen's extended eye-gouging 
   demise and John's death) and plenty of full-frontal nudity (I haven't 
   seen so much bush except in a porn film, some of it shot in extreme 
   close-up, especially in Stephen's scissor scene) not only makes the 
   film highly watchable, but is also integral in enjoying the film as 
   pure horror with plenty of surprises. The film now seems whole, 
   rather than leaving you asking questions where you get no answers. 
   Speaking of the scissors scene in the beginning of the film: It 
   finally shows us what type of psychopath Stephen really is, rather 
   than just implying it throughout the rest of the film in the R-Rated 
   cut. We also find out what happens to John, which was also a nagging 
   question. The amount of female nudity in this cut is staggering and 
   no body part is missing by the camera's lens. Director Norman J. 
   Warren could run hot (<B><A HREF="alien_prey_1978.htm">ALIEN PREY</A></B>

   this new Uncut version, it will definitely get repeat viewings from 
   me. It's amazing what a little restored footage can do to vastly 
   improve a film. Let me just say that I now consider this one of 
   Norman J. Warren's best films. It was available on VHS in it's 
   R-Rated edition by various bootleg companies (I can't find one 
   legitimate VHS release in the United States), but there are many DVD 
   incarnations, including a <A HREF="satans_slave_1976_terror_1978_dvd.htm">double
    feature DVD</A> (with the previously mentioned <B><A HREF="terror_1978c.htm">TERROR</A></B>)
    by the defunct Deimos Entertainment (the line was taken over by <A HREF="http://www.codereddvd.com">Code

   as Rhino Video's <B><A HREF="horrible_horrors_collection_volume_1_dvd_compilation.htm">HORRIBLE

   both of which were all films released by Crown International Pictures 
   to movie theaters. If you want to see the Uncut version, though, you 
   can only see it on this DVD, which comes with a plethora of extras, 
   including deleted scenes, old and new featurettes and <B>FRAGMENTS</B> 
   (1965), the first short film directed by Warren. Also known as <B>EVIL
    HERITAGE</B> (the name of the shooting script), but changed to the

   the shooting title, but I'll be damned if I could find any material

   Moira Young as Alexander's wife (also an Associate Producer), Monika

   Paul and Jill leave the rest of the group back at the wreckage and 
   head-off in search of civilization and rescue, not aware that the 
   directions given them by Eric are completely wrong. When Anna 
   discovers that Eric is a couple of sandwiches short of a picnic, she 
   and the remainder of the group head out to catch up with Jake and his 
   gang and put them in the right direction. They do catch up, but a 
   lack of water puts them all in a weakened state. Louis is the first 
   to fall victim. Too weak to walk, the<A HREF="savage_hunger_1984.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/savage hunger vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   group are forced to leave him behind as they move forward (Paul takes 
   one last picture of him, but a disgusted Jill breaks his camera). 
   Eric takes his life the next day by swallowing a handful of sand, 
   imagining it to be water. The remaining seven survivors trek on 
   through the blazing sun and hot sand, all of them moments away from 
   dying of dehydration and heat stroke (Alex gets so thirsty, he drinks 
   his own urine). Anna and Alex steal the last bit of water and 
   break-off from the rest of the group, selfishly heading out on their 
   own. Too bad for them, because the rest of the group find a man-made 
   mini oasis, complete with a well full of water. They have two major 
   problems, though. The first one is that though they have plenty of 
   water, they have nothing to carry it in, forcing them to stay at the 
   oasis and hoping someone finds them. The second problem is food. 
   Besides a couple of lizards, there is no nourishment to be had. They 
   are in quite the conundrum, which is further complicated by a wound 
   on Jill's foot that is turning gangreinous and Jake going looney from 
   hunger. He wants to kill Jill and cannibalize her body, but Paul 
   protects her until she dies and he then buries her in a secret 
   location. Jake goes quite mad and murders Paul while Matt and 
   Jennifer (who are now lovers) watch and do nothing. Jakes slices-up 
   Paul's body (it's a pretty graphic scene) and cooks his flesh over an 
   open fire. Matt refuses to eat it, but Jennifer gobbles it down and 
   becomes Jake's bitch. Will Matt finally cave-in and eat human flesh 
   or will he fight the craving and realize that when the Paul buffet 
   runs dry, he will be next on the menu? Man, I get the feeling that 
   things are going to get hot at the oasis.&nbsp; I remember watching 
   this film (also known as <B>THE OASIS</B>) on the CBS Late Movie in 
   the mid-80's, but finally seeing it on home video is like watching a 
   whole different film, since the sanitized TV edit deleted all the 
   nudity, violence and the entire cannibal subplot! Director Sparky 
   Greene (sadly, this is his only feature film credit) holds off on 
   most of the graphic violence and nudity until the final third of the 
   film, so when it does come, it's shocking and totally unexpected. The 
   scene where Jake cuts into a dead Paul's arm with a jagged piece of 
   metal is about as graphic as a film can get. Until then, Greene was 
   more interested in showing us the plight of the survivors as they 
   traverse the barren desert (filmed in Death Valley, California) in 
   search of food and shelter. Watching their suffering is an emotional 
   ordeal and I dare you not to reach for something to drink while 
   viewing this. The script (by Tom Klassen) has minimal dialogue, but 
   the words are chosen carefully and some lines resonate, thanks to a 
   cast of veteran actors. Just listen to what Louis asks of the group 
   before they walk off, leaving him in the hot sun to die: &quot;Every 
   once in a while, just think of me, okay?&quot;<B> </B>You can 
   actually see the pain and anguish on the other people's faces when he 
   gasps that out. Not a typical line of dialogue for a film like this. 
   I especially liked the downbeat ending, where Jennifer knocks-out 
   Jake when he is choking Matt. When Matt and Jennifer leave the oasis 
   with a full jug of water (Matt finds the jug next to the corpses of 
   Anna and Alex, who have been picked-clean by vultures), Matt asks 
   Jennifer why she picked him over Jake. When she answers, &quot;There 
   was more of him!&quot;, it leaves little doubt what is in the 
   backpack Matt is carrying. They then spot a road and think they are 
   saved, throwing the water and backpack to the ground and running 
   towards the road, but as the camera pans overhead, it reveals that 
   nothing but miles of barren, empty terrain lies ahead of them. That's 
   just mean but, boy, does it ever pack a punch. If you can find the 
   VHS tape of this film from <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Vestron Video">Vestron

    We watch an ancient Etruscan mass human sacrifice in a large grotto 
   containing a deep pit that is spewing out unknown fumes. We watch 
   young couples walking into the pit as priest talks Etruscan and 
   someone grabs their heads and turns them 180&#176; (ouch!). It turns 
   out this is part of a nightmare Joan Barnard (Elvire Audray; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#VampireInVenice1988">VAMPIRE
    IN VENICE</A></B> - 1988) is having in her apartment in New York 
   City. But is it a nightmare or a vision? The next morning, she tells 
   scientist co-worker Mike Grant (Paolo Malco; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NewYorkRipper1982">THE
    NEW YORK RIPPER</A></B> - 1982) that she had another dream where 
   someone spoke Etruscan to her and Mike jokingly says he could think 
   of better things to do with her at night. Joan reminds him that she 
   is married to archaeologist Arthur Barnard (John Saxon; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Tenebre1982">TENEBRE</A></B> 
   - 1982) and Mike replies that she hasn't seen him in months and every 
   time she talks to him on the phone they get into an argument. Mike 
   continues to say that when Etruscan women had disagreements with 
   their spouses, they would get revenge by jumping in bed with the 
   first man they see. We then find out that Arthur has been away from 
   home for ten months researching Etruscan ruins in Italy, financed by 
   Joan's rich father, Mulligan (Van Johnson; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#KillerCrocodile">KILLER
    CROCODILE</A></B> - 1989), and his foundation. Joan tells Mike that 
   she has been having these nightmares for quite some time and she 
   believes they will end when Arthur comes home. Joan then notices some 
   photos of ruins on Mike's desk and he tells her Arthur sent them for 
   him to analyze. When Joan picks up one of the photos, she sees 
   maggots crawling on it (thousands on 'em!). She starts screaming, 
   calling out Arthur's name, but when Mike touches her, the maggots 
   disappear. What is going on here?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Arthur by a river somewhere in Italy. He sees an old man 
   playing a flute (Luigi Rossi), making a deadly snake retreat from 
   Arthur's feet. Arthur thanks the old man and discovers he is well 
   versed in Etruscan lore. The old man tells Arthur he has something to 
   show him and they walk away. At the same time, Joan is taking an 
   afternoon nap and has another nightmare, only this time she sees an 
   Etruscan woman (who could be Joan's double [as a matter of fact, 
   Elvire Audray portrays her]) twist Arthur's head the way no head 
   should ever be twisted. The phone then rings and it's Arthur, who 
   tells Joan he won't be home any time soon because he has made an 
   important discovery. He tells Joan that he is shipping some crates 
   back to the foundation and to tell her father that before the crates 
   can be shipped, he needs to send a telex (an 80's version of a fax or 
   email). Joan is pissed, telling Arthur she isn't doing anything until 
   he tells her why he isn't coming home. Arthur tells her he found an 
   ancient Etruscan tomb hidden in a cave in an enormous grotto and this 
   may be the greatest discovery in archaeological history. It's the 
   richest Etruscan tomb ever discovered. Joan tells Arthur that there's 
   a pit in the grotto that is spewing out noxious fumes and Arthur is 
   stunned, asking her how she knew that. &quot;I dreamt it&quot; says 
   Joan, describing the location in more detail. While she is talking on 
   the phone, someone sneaks up behind Arthur, grabs his head and twists 
   it 180&#176;, killing him (Hey, better he's dead, because re-learning 
   how to take a piss will be messy!). As Joan screams out Arthur's 
   name, she hears someone speaking Etruscan on the other end of the 
   phone and then passes out. We then see Arthur dead on the floor. If 
   he could lift his head, he would see his ass!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A few days later, Joan is sitting in her father's office, Mulligan 
   telling her that either a lunatic or a burglar murdered Arthur, even 
   the Italian police believe that. Joan wants to go to Italy to 
   investigate Arthur's death herself, but her father starts 
   bad-mouthing Arthur, telling Joan the only reason Arthur married her 
   was for his foundation and money. He seems more interested in the 
   crates than Arthur's murder, telling Joan that he put Heather Hull 
   (Wandisa Guida; <B><A HREF="action.htm#LightningBolt1966">LIGHTNING BOLT</A></B> 
   - 1966) in charge of the operation and she will makes sure the crates 
   are shipped to him. The biggest questions becomes this: Why is 
   Mulligan so interested in the crates and what's in them? Joan reminds 
   her father about the telex and he blows it off, telling his daughter 
   that Arthur demanded $100,000 for some tomb he found (He says this 
   about Arthur: &quot;You can be a great archaeologist and still be a 
   fink.&quot;). He tells Joan that Heather will be back at the end of 
   the week and she will tell her anything she wants to know, but until 
   then she should go to the ranch and relax. Joan says she will do just 
   that...when she gets back from Italy. She's sure Heather's &quot;field
    report&quot; will tell her nothing.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Joan flies to Italy with Mike, who insists on going with her. She 
   then talks to the Police Commissioner (Gianfranco Barra; Martino's <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SuspicDeathMinor75">THE
    SUSPICIOUS DEATH OF A MINOR</A></B> - 1975), who takes Joan and Mike 
   to the home of Contessa Maria Volumna (Marilu Tolo; <B><A HREF="confessions_of_a_police_captain_1971.htm">CONFESSIONS
    OF A POLICE CAPTAIN</A></B> - 1971), who says Arthur was a guest in 
   her home. It's obvious that she is lying to Joan, telling her that 
   Arthur stayed with her for a week, he wanted to look at her library 
   of old and ancient books for some research. Heather then arrives and 
   Joan asks her for the location of the Etruscan tomb Arthur found, but 
   Heather says she doesn't know what Joan is talking about. When Joan 
   goes through Arthur's personal belongings, she finds a slip of paper 
   and written on it is, &quot;There is twelve!!&quot; (Apparently, 
   Arthur failed English sentence structure in school!) There is also a 
   receipt from a local jeweler and when she goes to the shop, the 
   jeweler shows her an ancient gold amulet in the shape of a scorpion 
   with two tails, telling her that Arthur brought it in to his shop to 
   turn it into a necklace (A scorpion with two tails is a symbol of 
   divinity in ancient Etruscan culture). The jeweler gives Joan the 
   necklace, telling her that Arthur said he was giving it to 
   &quot;someone special&quot; and believes it was for her.&nbsp; Is she 
   the special one?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Heather takes Joan and Mike, along with bodyguard Nick Forte 
   (Jacques Stany; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#FourFliesVelvet1971">FOUR 
   FLIES ON GREY VELVET</A></B> - 1971), to the ruins Arthur was 
   supposedly examining and a stone statue of an old man playing the 
   flute gets Joan's undivided attention. It's obvious that these ruins 
   are nothing but a tourist trap, but Joan walks off on her own, as if 
   she were in a trance, interrupting a photographer, Gianni Andrucci 
   (Franco Garofalo; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Possessor1975">THE
    POSSESSOR</A></B> - 1975), who is taking photos of two models in 
   swimsuits. Joan starts seeing people from her nightmares and millions 
   of maggots flow out of the eyes of one ancient stone statue until 
   Mike, once again, snaps her out of it. Nick Forte is then found dead, 
   his neck snapped and his head twisted 180&#176;. Joan tells Mike that 
   she saw Nick die and she is sure her &quot;visions&quot; are 
   prophecies of things to come. That night, Joan walks among the ruins 
   by herself and meets the old man with the flute. She asks him if he 
   knows who killed Arthur and he replies, &quot;It is not easy to 
   understand the designs of the gods. Tomorrow you will see the 
   light.&quot; Why does everyone have to talk in riddles in films like 
   this? Why don't they just come out and tell it like it is? (That's a 
   rhetorical question and I already know the answer!)</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Eleven crates arrive at the foundation and Mulligan is excited to 
   open one particular crate, which is marked. A couple of goons 
   (obviously bad men because they wear sunglasses at night!) open the 
   crate and it is full of cheap vases, not what Mulligan was expecting. 
   Thinking that he opened the wrong crate, Mulligan orders the goons to 
   open all the crates, but mob boss Masaccio (Maurizio Mattioli; <B><A HREF="special_cop_in_action_1976.htm">A
    SPECIAL COP IN ACTION</A></B> - 1976) tells the goons to stop, they 
   were hoodwinked, giving Mulligan two weeks to make good, otherwise 
   he's a dead man. Since the mob is involved, it's not difficult to 
   figure out what was supposed to be in that crate: drugs, heroin to be 
   precise. Three hundred pounds of it, with a street value of seven 
   million dollars. When Masaccio and the goons leave, Mulligan opens 
   all the crates by himself, finding nothing but cheap vases with the 
   image of a man playing the flute on them in all the crates. How's 
   that for irony?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next day, the old man takes Joan to the cave with the enormous 
   grotto. Joan recognizes it from her nightmares and knows where she 
   has to go without being told (The old man hands her an oil lamp and 
   says, &quot;The light is yours!&quot;). She finds the crate full of 
   heroin and figures out what &quot;There is twelve!!&quot; means 
   (there were eleven crates shipped to the foundation and this was the 
   twelfth one). Joan is then kidnapped by the two goons and thrown into 
   the back of their car. Mulligan arrives in Italy looking for the 
   missing crate and when Heather and Mike tell him that Joan is 
   missing, he doesn't seem worried and he drives to the Contessa's 
   house. She lies to Mulligan, telling him she was lucky to find Joan 
   walking alone on a dark street and hands her over to her father. Joan 
   calls her father a drug dealer and he doesn't deny it, telling her 
   sure, he has drugs shipped to his foundation in New York City, but 
   he's just a &quot;link in a chain&quot;, saying if she doesn't want 
   to see him dead, she will show him where the twelfth crate is. Joan, 
   Mulligan, the Contessa and her driver go to the cave, but when they 
   get out of the car, someone takes a shot at them, forcing them to get 
   in the car and drive away. They go back to the cave at night, where 
   they find both Heather and the old man dead, their necks snapped the 
   same way as everyone else. While the pit is spewing toxic fumes, Joan 
   goes into one of her trances and she, her father, the Contessa and 
   the driver are shot by Masaccio's goons, Joan being the only 
   survivor. She is operated on in a hospital, where a surgeon removes a 
   bullet from her heart, telling Mike it is a miracle she survived. 
   Joan's recovery is quick and she tells the Police Commissioner that 
   she is not leaving Italy until she discovers the truth of what 
   happened to her husband and father. Another archaeologist, Paolo 
   Domelli (Claudio Cassinelli; Martino's <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Screamers1980">SCREAMERS</A></B> 
   - 1980) appears and tells Joan she bears a striking resemblance to a 
   painting in an Etruscan tomb he has discovered. When Joan goes to the 
   tomb and sees the painting, she knows that she is the reincarnation 
   of a female Etruscan goddess, who was said to be immortal. Together 
   with Paolo and photographer Gianni, who may have taken a photo of the 
   killer during his shoot at the tourist trap, Joan begins to unravel 
   the mystery to solve who killed her husband and everyone else. When 
   Mike is found dead in the twelfth crate, his head given the old 180 
   and the drugs missing, Joan begins to lose control, as if someone is 
   taking over her body and soul. What happens next is pure WTF?!? 
   cinema, best seen than explained, but I will tell you this: One of 
   the murder victims is not dead at all and another person close to 
   Joan is the killer. Will Joan begin to walk and see what's behind her 
   at the same time or will she survive this Etruscan nightmare? And 
   just who is snapping all of these necks and why?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    If this film seems highly fragmented and lacking any bloody graphic 
   violence or female nudity (although a <A HREF="scorpion_with_two_tails_1982.htm#FranceLobbycard">French
    lobbycard</A> shows there was some nudity in this film), it was 
   because this was originally filmed as a three hour TV miniseries 
   titled <B>IL MISTERIO DEGLI ETRUSCHI</B> (&quot;The Mystery Of The 
   Etruscans&quot;), but it was scrapped and never aired. It was edited 
   down to 97 minutes, which explains some of the jumps in narrative 
   logic (such as Joan's extremely quick recovery in the hospital) and 
   why John Saxon is in it for no longer than five minutes (his role was 
   much larger in the TV version). That's not to say that this version 
   is a waste of time, because it's not. Sergio Martino's long-time 
   cinematographer, Giancarlo Ferrando (Martino's <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#YourViceLockedRoom">YOUR
    VICE IS A LOCKED ROOM AND ONLY I HAVE THE KEY</A></B> - 1972 and <B><A HREF="action.htm#ViolentProfession73">THE
    VIOLENT PROFESSIONALS</A></B> - 1973), does a great job giving the 
   grotto and pit a sense of dread and the many neck snappings are still 
   hard to watch, even though they are bloodless (although, I must say, 
   one such victim of a neck snapping walking on both feet during the 
   finale of the film did bring a smile to my face). Since Martino is 
   the director, you know you can count on him delivering a film full of 
   atmospheric sequences, especially Joan's nightmares, which are 
   brimming with otherworldly charm and multiple neck snappings. Van 
   Johnson, a great actor from the &quot;Hollywood System&quot; of the 
   '40s &amp; '50s, adds a touch of class in his role as a rich 
   drug-running father, making me understand why he was used numerous 
   times in Italian genre films from the '60s to the '90s (<B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#PriceOfPower1969">THE

   offset Elvire Audray's role as Joan, who is simply terrible here, 
   appearing like she is reading her lines off cue cards or looking like 
   a deer in the headlights when she is supposed to be frightened or

   this film, even though it plays like a horror film. While this isn't 
   prime Martino, it is still and enjoyable and offbeat way to spend 97 
   minutes of your time. The final 30 minutes are especially memorable. 
   It's like living in a waking fever dream, where up is down, black is 
   white and God is the Devil. Maybe its nightmarish feel is because of 
   the condensed narrative, but whatever it is, it works. The film ends 
   with a skyline view of New York City, where the Twin Towers are 
   framed in the center, a reminder that they are no longer there and 
   that this was a simpler time in our history.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   theater, pay fifty cents to get in and see all kinds of movies, not 
   just horror. Wiping all nostalgia aside and not realizing at such a 
   young age that I was watching a heavily edited version of the film (a 
   common practice by American International Pictures [A.I.P.], who 
   distributed this film in the United States), let's get on with the 
   review of the uncensored version.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Based on Oscar Wilde's novel &quot;The Picture Of Dorian Gray&quot;, 
   the film opens with Dorian Gray (Helmut Berger; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BloodstainButter71">THE
    BLOODSTAINED BUTTERFLY</A></B> - 1971) complaining to some unseen 
   elderly man that the &quot;portrait&quot; is the cause of all his 
   troubles. We then see him washing blood off his hands and then 
   covering up a painting in his attic (in an effective unedited 
   sequence where he walks through his home). Dorian is a troubled young 
   man who stares into his fireplace while stroking his black cat. We 
   then travel back in time to discover why he is so troubled. It starts 
   in 1920s London, where Dorian is the audience of a nightclub with 
   friends Basil (Richard Todd; <B><A HREF="asylum_1973.htm">ASYLUM</A></B> 
   - 1972) and Alan (Renato Romano; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Frankenstein 80">FRANKENSTEIN
    '80</A></B> - 1972), watching a transvestite dance on stage. Dorian 
   is looking for an act to perform at his rich Aunt's newly renovated 
   retirement home. He and his friends agree that this isn't the act and 
   leave. They part ways after leaving the nightclub and Dorian drives 
   home worrying about finding an act worthy enough to please his Aunt. 
   He sees a theater where &quot;Romeo And Juliet&quot; is being 
   rehearsed and stops the car, goes inside and watches Sybil Vane 
   (Marie Liljedahl; <B><A HREF="ann_and_eve_1970.htm">ANN AND EVE</A></B> 
   - 1970) rehearsing the role of Juliet. When their eyes meet, it's 
   love at first sight (for the both of them). They have a wonderful and 
   loving relationship. While making love, Dorian is surprised to 
   discover that Sybil is a virgin and he is happy that she gave up her 
   virginity to him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Dorian tells Basil about Sybil and he tells Dorian that she must be 
   someone special, as he paints Dorian's portrait. Basil's paintings 
   are admired by the wealthy Henry Wotton (Herbert Lom; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Sect1991">THE
    SECT</A></B> - 1991) and his sister Gwendolyn (Margaret Lee; <A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SlaughterHotel1971"><B>SLAUGHTER
    HOTEL</B></A> - 1971), especially Dorian's portrait. While Gwendolyn 
   lustfully watches Dorian taking a shower outside, Basil tells Henry 
   that Dorian's portrait is not for sale as it is not yet finished. 
   Basil introduces them to Dorian and mentions that he is about to get 
   married (Henry says, &quot;What is vice anyway? Simply pleasure 
   without shame.&quot;). This doesn't phase Gwendolyn, who we can see 
   has the hots for Dorian. Sybil lives with her brother James (Stewart 
   Black) and their mother and James doesn't have a high opinion of 
   Dorian, who picks her up and drives her to his parents dilapidated 
   country cottage. He shows her the bed and Sybil accuses him of 
   bringing other girls to the cottage and runs away. Dorian denies it 
   and runs after her and they then make love under a beautiful tree.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Dorian is than at his rich Aunt's retirement home with friend Alan, 
   when Henry shows up and quizzes him about Sybil and then says one day 
   he will be old and wrinkled, beautiful no more (Henry says, 
   &quot;Beauty lasts a very, very short time.&quot;). Basil finishes 
   Dorian's portrait, where Dorian asks, &quot;Why should I get old, 
   while this stays young? Why can't it be the other way around?&quot; 
   Henry hears Dorian say he would give up his soul to make that happen 
   and buys the portrait as a present for Dorian. From that point on, 
   Dorian is a different person and it is not for the better. A man with 
   no soul can never be a real man.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Dorian becomes obsessed with his portrait and Sybil becomes jealous, 
   asking Dorian if he would leave her when she becomes old. The old 
   Dorian would have said no, by the soulless Dorian, who is obsessed 
   with youth, has a totally different answer. Dorian cheats on Sybil 
   with Gwendolyn at a party the very next day. He then goes to the 
   theater with rich (and horny) old lady Mrs. Ruxton (Isa Miranda; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BayOfBlood1971">A
    BAY OF BLOOD</A></B> - 1971) to watch Sybil in the play, only to 
   discover she is a lousy actress, seemingly blowing her lines on 
   purpose as a way to make Dorian mad. Sybil then commits suicide after 
   losing Dorian and it doesn't bother him one bit. As the years pass 
   away, Dorian remains young while his portrait bears the wrinkles of 
   time, getting uglier as the passage of time progresses. Dorian begins 
   to live the life of a rich, spoiled playboy, who uses sex as a way to 
   climb the ladder of success. But at what price? We are also let in on 
   who Dorian was talking to in the beginning of the film and why he had 
   to wash blood off his hands. The film ends with a final quotation 
   from Oscar Wilde's novel, telling us that immortality is not as great 
   as you hope it will be.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Filmed many times, including a silent version made in 1910 and the 
   best known one in 1945 (as <B><A HREF="picture_of_dorian_gray_1945.htm">THE
    PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY</A></B>, starring Hurd Hatfield as Dorian), 
   it is this version that is the most faithful to Oscar Wilde's (who 
   was openly gay) novel. It is also the most sexually charged version, 
   which leaves little to the imagination. Director/co-screenwriter 
   Massimo Dallamano (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WhatDoneSolange1972">WHAT 
   HAVE YOU DONE TO SOLANGE?</A></B> - 1972; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightChild1975">THE
    NIGHT CHILD</A></B> - 1975) has crafted an exquisite portrait 
   (pardon the pun) of a man obsessed with age and how he uses his never-ending
    youth and beauty to his advantage until it consumes him. While his 
   friends and family grow old and die around him (Dorian even resorts 
   to murder), Dorian is determined to understand how to live without a 
   soul. When Sybil commits suicide, Dorian becomes angry rather than feeling<A HREF="dorian_gray_1970.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/dorian gray 1970 ad mat16 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   remorse and he finally accepts living without a soul, but it's harder 
   than you may think. But how long can a person live before becoming 
   disillusioned with life (or as Dorian says, &quot;Even youth becomes 
   boring&quot;)? Dallamano and Helmut Berger (who is excellent) show us 
   down to the tiniest detail what it is like to live a soulless life. 
   An elongated life full of sex (including homosexuality) and 
   debauchery takes its toll on Dorian as the decades pass until there 
   is only one thing left to do and that is accept death. Only he and 
   Henry don't age, which brings up the question: Is Henry the Devil or 
   is he a Devil's disciple? He very well may be one of those, as he 
   haunts Dorian through the decades, making him do things that he 
   really doesn't want to do. But how do you cheat the Devil?&nbsp; This 
   is a wonderfully mounted film, as the screenplay by Dallamano, 
   Marcello Coscia (<B><A HREF="yeti_1977.htm">YETI: GIANT OF THE 20TH CENTURY</A></B> 
   - 1977) &amp; G&uuml;nter Ebert (<B><A HREF="sadomania_1981.htm">SADOMANIA</A></B> 
   - 1981) shows us how the sexual mores have changed over the decades, 
   leading us into the mod, anything goes contemporary London of the 
   late-'60s. We watch an aging Alan, who is newly married, having sex 
   with a black model named Adrienne (Beryl Cunningham; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#WeekendMurders1970">WEEKEND
    MURDERS</A></B> - 1970), while Dorian seduces Alan's new wife Alice 
   (Maria Rohm; <B><A HREF="night_of_the_blood_monster_1970.htm">NIGHT 
   OF THE BLOOD MONSTER</A></B> - 1970), appearing nude in her bathroom 
   doorway and then screwing her. There is no boundary Dorian won't 
   cross. The music, by Peppino De Luca (<B><A HREF="man_with_icy_eyes_1971.htm">THE
    MAN WITH ICY EYES</A></B> - 1971), changes through the decades and 
   adds to the film's effectiveness. This is a great discovery for me 
   as, I have previously mentioned, this was my first R-Rated film, but 
   this film goes beyond an R Rating and crosses over the line, not in 
   violence, mind you, but in depictions of sex.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This Italian/West German/United Kingdom co-production was released 
   theatrically in the U.S. by A.I.P., with the same edited version 
   showing up on VHS from NTA Home Entertainment. The widescreen, uncut 
   DVD from <A HREF="http://www.rarovideousa.com">Raro Video</A> (my 
   review is based on this DVD) is an absolute revelation, as the print 
   is flawless, looking like it was shot yesterday. The extras on the 
   disc are sparse, just a filmography of Massimo Dallamano and an 
   interview with assistant director Maurizio Tanfani, who has lots of 
   great stories to tell (Franco Nero was considered for the role of 
   Dorian; Dallamano got turned on by the sex scenes!; Herbert Lom's 
   nose was so crooked, they had to use putty on it every day to 
   straighten it out), not all about this film (he had a great career 
   and worked with some of the genre greats). A nice presentation at a

    Gail Bland (Daniela Giordano; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#YourViceLockedRoom">YOUR
    VICE IS A LOCKED ROOM AND ONLY I HAVE THE KEY</A></B> - 1972), an 
   advertising executive, is sent to Cairo, Egypt to talk to the people 
   who run Isis Cosmetics, but when she gets to the Cairo airport, no 
   one from Isis is there to meet her. To make matters worse, a man at 
   the airport bumps into Gail and steals an important letter she needs 
   to do business. As she takes a taxi to her hotel, it is blocked by a 
   crowd of people dancing wildly in the streets, all of them noticing 
   Gail's red hair. A witch-looking woman sticks her head into the taxi 
   and tries to sell Gail a ring, but she shows the woman that she is 
   already wearing a ring that looks exactly like it, so the woman 
   laughs and leaves. A man then gives Gail a pack of Egyptian 
   cigarettes, telling her she really needs them, but when she says she 
   doesn't want them, the man disappears like a ghost. Once Gail gets to 
   her hotel, the man at the desk seemingly knows her, but he says 
   someone told him she was arriving, mentioning Gail's red hair. 
   Apparently, no woman in Egypt has red hair, except for Gail. When 
   Gail asks him who told him she was coming, he tells her he doesn't 
   know, also mentioning to her that there were two phone calls for her, 
   but they didn't leave a message. Gail thinks it was her agency 
   calling to make sure she arrived safely or someone from Isis 
   Cosmetics explaining why they didn't meet her at the airport. She is 
   then given the key to Room 3, a beautiful apartment overlooking the 
   hotel's garden. As Gail unpacks her bags and takes a shower (Nudity 
   alert!), she gets a phone call from the front desk telling her that 
   someone is on the line wanting to talk to her, but when they connect 
   her, no one is on the other end of the line. Gail notices a 
   strange-looking small cloth doll in one of the plants in the room and 
   when she picks it up it pricks her finger. She then looks out her 
   window and sees a dark-haired woman looking directly at her (played 
   by Carol Lobravico in her only film role. Her tragic death will be 
   explained at the end of this review.), but she quickly walks away 
   when she realizes Gail has seen her. Exactly what is going on here?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At the hotel's bar, Gail meets a strange man (William Berger; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#MurderClinic1966">THE
    MURDER CLINIC</A></B>&nbsp; - 1966) who says to her, &quot;She is 
   the mistress of my soul, the one who wears the ring of Isis&quot;, 
   referring to the ring Gail wears on her finger. She tells him she has 
   been wearing the ring for a year, but she had no idea it had any 
   meaning. The man asks her how she got it and Gail replies from her 
   mother, it's always been in her family. The man knows Gail's name and 
   when she asks how, he replies, &quot;This is a country of mystery, 
   where no one can keep a secret.&quot; Gail then tells the man that 
   Isis Cosmetics insisted she come alone to Egypt to discuss a new 
   perfume they are launching, called &quot;Isis&quot;, but they failed 
   to meet her at the airport or call her at the hotel, referring to 
   them as &quot;the ghosts who brought her here.&quot; Little does she 
   know that she is not far off her assessment of them. No one knows 
   anything about Isis Cosmetics; they're not even in the phone 
   directory, but Gail does have the address they gave her and that is 
   her next step in unraveling the mystery. The man looks at the address 
   and tells her it is a small street in the &quot;old town&quot; and 
   the bartender says it's directly behind the Mosque of Omar, only it 
   is not an area where a woman should go alone. When Gail asks the man 
   his name, he tells her to call him Caleb and he offers to accompany 
   Gail to the address tomorrow at 10:00 am and she accepts. She also 
   accepts Caleb's offer to be her tour guide for the night. When she is 
   on the dance floor of a disco, Gail meets the brother and sister team 
   of Seth (Antonio Cantafora; <B><A HREF="baron_blood_1972.htm">BARON BLOOD</A></B> 
   - 1972) and Nephthys (Krista Nell; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Slasher1972">THE
    SLASHER...IS THE SEX MANIAC!</A></B> - 1972), Seth calling her 
   &quot;the girl with the flaming red hair&quot; and how they were 
   waiting for her because &quot;It was pre-destined that we meet.&quot; 
   When Gail asks how they know her, Seth says, &quot;It's better if you 
   don't ask too many questions. It could be dangerous, as a fact.&quot; 
   Gail smokes some of the Egyptian cigarettes the man left for her in 
   the taxi and it's plain to see that they were laced with some 
   acid-like drug, as she dances the night away with Seth and his sister 
   (who doesn't speak), but she does notice that Caleb is no longer 
   there. Gail stumbles into her hotel room and when she tries to go to 
   sleep, all she can see are close-ups of strange people's faces and 
   they are all laughing at her (The visuals, including a naked Nephthys 
   walking towards an equally naked Gail, are filmed like she is 
   tripping on LSD). When Nephthys begins making Sapphic love to Gail, 
   she sees that everyone are watching them, as if they belonged to some 
   type of coven. &quot;Cult&quot; would be a more appropriate term.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    At 10:00 am, Caleb meets Gail at her hotel and they go to the 
   address written on a piece of paper. They ring the doorbell and no 
   one answers, so Caleb finds another way into the building and lets 
   Gail in. He and Gail go exploring, but the building seems to be 
   empty. When Caleb goes upstairs to see if anyone is there, Gail meets 
   a young girl who is singing &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot;, who tells 
   Gail she doesn't belong here because &quot;the walls have arms like 
   tentacles&quot; and to leave immediately because it's a trap. When 
   the young girl sees Caleb approaching, she quickly runs away and 
   Caleb wants to know what she said to Gail. She tells Caleb she 
   doesn't know and wants to leave the building as quickly as possible. 
   Gail now believes Isis Cosmetics doesn't exist and wants to call her 
   agency back in New York, but Caleb tells her to calm down and not to 
   let a little girl frighten her; telling Gail she is safe with him. 
   But is she? When Gail gets back to her hotel, she tries to call New 
   York, only to be told that it is impossible because there was a 
   breakdown in the line overseas and they don't know when it will be 
   fixed. Why does Caleb give a sly smile when he hears this? Caleb 
   tells Gail to quit worrying about her job and pretend she is on 
   vacation until the phone lines are fixed. Caleb tells her he will 
   take her places where she can breathe the air of the pharaohs, who 
   have been sleeping for thousands of years, encased in their tombs! 
   Unlike me, Gail is not creeped-out by this at all and when Caleb asks 
   her if he can call her by her first name, we can see a romance is 
   developing, but is this wise?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Caleb takes Gail to all the tourist attractions, including the 
   pyramids and the Sphinx, riding on camels and falling in love. Caleb 
   knows his Egyptian history, taking Gail to the Cairo Museum and 
   showing her statues of Horus, the son of Osiris and Isis. He then 
   shows her the statue of Seth, the &quot;Prince of Evil&quot; and the 
   jealous brother of Osiris. Osiris is the &quot;Lord of the 
   Shadows&quot; and the symbol of resurrection. Isis is the 
   &quot;Goddess of Fertility.&quot; Caleb makes a remark that Isis 
   resembles Gail (Isis wore the same ring Gail wears and it is said 
   that she also had red hair) and Gail says that Osiris resembles Caleb 
   (But Caleb asks Gail how she knows that since Osiris always wears a 
   mask. Caleb wears a different kind of mask; one you cannot see.). 
   They both are right, but what does this have to do with anything? 
   Actually, quite a bit, but be patient, we'll get there eventually. 
   Legend has it that Seth and his sister Nephthys were jealous of 
   Osiris and plotted to kill him. They divided his body into little 
   pieces and scattered them throughout Egypt so no one could ever put 
   them back together again. Seth desired Isis for his wife, but she 
   missed her loving husband, wandering throughout the land in search of 
   the pieces of his body. Ra, the Sun God, took pity on Isis when she 
   found all the pieces and restored Osiris back to life. Gail then 
   says, &quot;And they lived happily ever after&quot;, but Caleb says 
   no, they didn't. Isis later disappeared and since then Osiris has 
   been searching the land for her, to take her back with him to the 
   Kingdom of the Dead. &quot;One day, Isis will return, with a magic 
   symbol on her finger and her flaming red hair&quot;, Caleb concludes. 
   Is anyone making a connection yet? Allow me to continue to clarify 
   some things.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;Every legend is born of the truth&quot;:</FONT></B>&nbsp;
    Caleb tells Gail that the people she met at the disco are part of a 
   hippie cult that are gathered in Egypt to &quot;resume an ancient 
   cult&quot;, telling Gail to stay away from them because they are 
   dangerous. They are trying to invoke Osiris to put his power at their 
   disposal, but Caleb says they are not prepared for what comes next. 
   It will be fatal for them, saying to Gail, &quot;Everything is 
   superstition, but once proved, it becomes science.&quot; As an 
   example, he asks Gail if she believes in love and she says yes. He 
   then asks if she has ever seen love and Gail answers no. &quot;In 
   that case love is a superstition to you, isn't it?&quot; asks Caleb. 
   Gail just smiles and they walk out of the museum, holding hands. Gail 
   tells Caleb that she wants to walk around town on her own (&quot;I'll 
   confess, your charm is beginning to scare me!&quot;) and they part 
   ways, Caleb telling her if she needs or wants him, he is just a phone 
   call away. A towel-headed Egyptian man walks up to Gail and offers to 
   show her some genuine Egyptian souvenirs. Gail agrees, but tells him 
   to be quick about it. He takes her to a nearby bazaar and when she 
   begins looking at a red scarf, Seth and his sister suddenly appear, 
   Seth telling Gail she should buy the blue scarf because it goes with 
   her red hair. It turns out the entire hippy cult is also at the 
   bazaar and a fight breaks out between the hippies and the merchants. 
   Seth leads Gail away from the fray, telling her it is much too 
   dangerous for her to be there, so he drives Gail and his sister to an 
   unknown location and stops the car. Gail knows the fight was nothing 
   but a set-up so Seth could get her alone (Seth doesn't deny it), but 
   she asks him why he is so interested in her. Seth tells Gail, 
   &quot;There is a little oasis in the desert about ten miles out of 
   town, where you'll find the ruins of a temple dedicated to Osiris. 
   There, once every month when the moon rises to the sky to her full 
   splendor and the shadows of night turn into day, all of the true 
   believers gather to celebrate the victory over the Prince in Black. 
   It's really a sight not to be missed.&quot; Seth tells Gail the 
   celebration is tomorrow night and wants to know if Gail will come. 
   Something tells me she will have no choice in the matter, since Seth 
   forgot to mention that the ritual needs a human sacrifice and since 
   Gail looks so much like Isis, the sacrifice will be her. That's the 
   story, but what happens next, I'll let you discover. I will tell you 
   this: Gail arrives at the celebration, is stripped completely naked 
   and tied spread-eagle to a stone altar, where the hippie cult offer 
   her as a sacrifice to Osiris in exchange for his power over death. 
   Before that happens, Gail receives a box of chocolates from the 
   dark-haired woman. The chocolates are drugged with an LSD-like 
   substance, leaving Gail unable to defend herself when she arrives at 
   the oasis. More trippy visuals follow as the cult dance around Gail 
   naked in a ritualistic dance that must be seen to be appreciated. 
   Will Gail escape the ritual or will the hippies succeed? And how is 
   Caleb involved? It not far off the mark to imagine that Gail is the 
   reincarnation of Isis and Caleb is actually the reincarnation of 
   Osiris, but is that enough to save Gail? You'll have to watch the 
   film to find out.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This Gothic supernatural horror film succeeds thanks to the 
   on-location Egyptian visuals, including getting to film at the feet 
   of the Sphinx, which is a rarity, since it has been off limits to 
   people for quite some time (Legend has it that Napoleon's soldiers 
   destroyed the Sphinx's nose, but that is a fallacy; the Sphinx is 
   made primarily of limestone and Egypt's wicked weather eroded the 
   nose). To see the Sphinx up-close, such as in this film, is a real 
   treat for viewers, especially those who are archaeology nuts, such as 
   myself. Both Daniela Giordano and Krista Nell spend a good part of 
   their screen time completely naked (When is Nell not naked on film?), 
   making this film easy on the eyes (There is also some bloody '70s 
   gore, but it is very sparse). As for your ears, Carlo Savina (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#NakedYouDie">NAKED

    GOD SAID TO CAIN</A></B> - 1970) offers an excellent music score, 
   full of Egyptian instruments during the ritualistic sacrifice 
   dancing, some trippy acid rock during the disco scenes and guitar 
   ballads when the hippies gather together in a circle and sing around 
   a campfire. There's also a strange rape scene late in the film when 
   the hippie cult discover a man and a woman spying on them. The men 
   gang rape the female, while the dark-haired woman whips the man 
   viciously with a cat 'o nine tails. It really doesn't make much sense 
   since they let them go once they are done with them. Director Mario

   tragedy to this film is what happened to actress Carol Lobravico

   students to the island in search of the same Yeti with disasterous

    alive, their bodies mutilated. On the island, the four students meet 
   Ernst's associate, Dr. Karl Werner (Tawm Ellis), and his mute Indian 
   servant, Laughing Crow (Ivan Agar), who serves them some unknown meat 
   which they all dislike except Keith Henshaw (Michael Harris), Ernst's 
   favorite student. Tom (Jack Neubeck) is the first student to be 
   attacked and killed by the Yeti (all that's left of him is a severed 
   leg). Lynn (Darcy Brown, who is a dead-ringer for Velma in the <B><A HREF="scooby_doo_animated_tv_series.htm">SCOOBY-DOO</A></B> 
   cartoons) is the next student to be offed by the white-haired demon. 
   Ernst uses Tom's severed leg as bait and is attacked by the Yeti but 
   survives. Karen (Jennifer Stock), another student, finds the rest of 
   Tom's body hidden in a greenhouse but can't get Keith or Ernst to 
   believe her. Ernst and Keith use Lynn's body to snare the Yeti in an 
   elaborate trap. The Yeti gets away and Keith follows it, only to 
   discover that this whole trip was just a ruse. They have been set up 
   by Ernst and Karl, as their bodies are to be served for breakfast for 
   Ernst's cannabalistic associates, who are staying in a motel a few 
   miles away. It seems the best-tasting human meat is that of someone 
   who is frightened to death (or as they say, &quot;Untouched by the 
   blade.&quot;), which they do to Karen using the Yeti (actually Karl 
   in a costume). Keith is given a choice: Join the cult or end up as 
   Karen (this is after they all attack Keith with forks!). The film

   the beginning of the film. It has been replaced by some public domain 
   music track and it sticks out like a sore thumb since it's the only

   than it actually is. The scene early on of a wife getting even with 
   her crazy husband with the help of a plugged-in toaster in a bathtub 
   is a classic of trash cinema. The cast of non-professional actors 
   acquit themselves rather nicely and on the whole deliver a sense of

    (it was filmed under the title <B>THE NIGHT OF THE DARK FULL MOON</B>)
    so seeing it in widescreen on a 60&quot; plasma TV screen was really 
   an eye-opener. And a word of warning: This is a film that demands 
   100% of your attention, so if you are thinking of putting this film 
   on while you do chores or work on your computer, pick another film. 
   This is a literal film where you have to actually use your brain to 
   figure things out, because not everything is spelled out in black and 
   white. There are some surprising scenes of brutal violence that hold 
   much more of an impact if you watch the film with all your attention 
   and the extended flashback tinted goldenrod (or a color close to it) 
   during the finale of the film is full of familiar faces if you were 
   ever into any of Andy Warhol's &quot;Factory&quot; work. Quite 
   frankly, if you don't give this film your full attention, you have no 
   right to watch it.&nbsp; The film is narrated by Diane Adams (genre 
   vet Mary Woronov, who was married to this film's director from 1970 
   to 1973). She talks about the history of the Butler House, and it's a 
   pretty sad story. On Christmas Eve, 1950, Wilfred Butler comes 
   running out of his house totally on fire and dies in the snow of his 
   burns. Wilfred Butler was a stranger to his hometown due to something 
   that happened in the house 15 years earlier and he hardly ever lived 
   in that house since then, which was why his death at the house was a 
   surprise to the residents. The town coroner officially announces that 
   Wilfred's death was an accident (actor Philip Bruns; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Return Dead 2">RETURN
    OF THE LIVING DEAD PART II</A></B> [1987] plays Wilfred in all the 
   photos, but we never meet him in person), but Mary was one of the 
   only one to think the opposite (she just has a feeling) and while 
   Wilfred is being buried (NO ONE showed up for his funeral; his 
   headstone reads: &quot;Who Bears The Cross Shall Wear The Crown&quot;)
    and we see a strange person playing the organ at the Butler House 
   the same time Wilfred is being buried and he is very interested in 
   the Butler family photos that fill the house (Stay with me, this will 
   all make sense). Diane grew up in this town (as a matter of fact, her 
   father is the Mayor) and she hears that Jeffrey Butler (James 
   Patterson; who died of cancer shortly after this film was finished 
   [it was filmed between 1970 to 1972] and his voice had to be looped 
   by someone else) is selling the beautiful house for $50,000 and she 
   wants to take one more look at it before the town buys it and tears 
   it down. You see, back in 1950, Wilfred Butler left the house and 
   everything else he owned to his only living relative, Jeffrey, with 
   just one codicil in the will: Jeffrey has to leave the house as 
   Wilfred left it &quot;to remind the world of its inhumanity and 
   cruelty&quot; (Believe me, all these obtuse clues really do lead 
   somewhere). News of the sale of the house reaches across State lines 
   and one crazy inmate (whom we cannot see) escapes using a pipe wrench 
   as a weapon and stealing a car, heading for the Butler House. The 
   lawyer that Jeffrey hired to sell the house, the married John Carter 
   (Patrick O'Neal; <B><A HREF="chamber_of_horrors_1966.htm">CHAMBER OF HORRORS</A></B> 
   - 1966), brings along is mistress &quot;secretary&quot; Ingrid 
   (Astrid Hereen; <B><A HREF="thomas_crown_affair_1968.htm">THE THOMAS 
   CROWN AFFAIR</A></B> - 1968) for a little nookie action between 
   business. John goes to talk to the Mayor (Walter Abel), Mary's 
   father, about selling the house, but he is ambushed by the Sheriff 
   (Walter Klavun), &quot;Communications Director&quot; Tess (Fran 
   Stevens), who is nothing but the switchboard operator, and the hard 
   of hearing and talking head of the local newspaper, Charlie (John 
   Carradine), who rings a bell (the kind you find at the desk of a 
   motel) everytime he disagrees with something, who are also in the 
   room. John offers the house for $50,000, but the Mayor says he will 
   have to travel to the next town tomorrow to take out a loan at the 
   bank, so John and Ingrid decide to stay in the Butler House, even 
   though everyone else warns him against it. He should have listened to 
   them. Ingrid gets a phone call from Tess, just to make sure the phone 
   is working. While they are in bed (after eating a meal, which they 
   bought at a local deli!), the killer brutally slaughters John and 
   Ingrid with an axe (it's really bloody) and the killer reads a 
   passage from the Bible and leaves a crucifix in John's bloody hand. 
   The Sheriff then gets a phone call from the killer and thinks it is 
   Jeffrey Butler. The killer tells him he is sick and needs the Sheriff 
   to come ro the Butler House immediately, which he does. Busy-body 
   Tess overhears the conversation and the killer knows she is listening-in,
    so he tells her he knows what happeded to Wilfred Butler's 15 
   year-old daughter Marianne (Donelda Dunne) and all those responsible, 
   including Tess, will pay with their lives. (The fact that most of the 
   people in this town are old should start to be setting off alarms 
   with some better film detectives). Tess becomes unhinged, because no 
   matter who she calls, no one answers. Jeffrey Butler steals John's 
   car (he wouldn't answer the door, so why not take his car on a cold 
   night?) and drives to Diane's house, where Diane holds a gun on him 
   until she finds out who he is. It seems Jeffrey gave his only key to 
   the house to John and since he is not answering the locked door, he 
   wonders if Diane knows of anyone else who would have a key. She tells 
   him the Sheriff's Deputy probably has a key and Jeffrey departs on 
   good terms with Diane. Meanwhile, the Sheriff notices an old oil lamp 
   lit up on Wilfred Butler's grave and discovers Wilfred's diary on the 
   ground. Before he can read it, the killer murders him with a shovel 
   (he was burying John and Ingrid). Jeffrey returns to Diane's house 
   because he couldn't locate the Sheriff's Deputy. When Diane mentions 
   that she keeps on getting phone calls from a woman looking for her 
   father, saying she is staying at the Butler House in the Reception 
   Room, both Jeffrey and Diane head to the Butler House in John's 
   stolen car (They have a funny back and forth about the stolen car 
   earlier before she mentioned the woman). They find the Sheriff's car 
   (with the lights flashing) at the gravesight of Jeffrey's 
   grandfather, so they think with both the lawyer and Shefiff missing, 
   it may not be a good idea to go to the Butler House (It's refreshing 
   to see two people act level-headed). They head to town to try and 
   find some help, but when they cannot find the Deputy, they head to 
   Charlie's newspaper office, who writes down that Tess went to the 
   Butler House. While Diane stays behind to do some research, Jeffrey 
   and Charlie head to Tess' house to see if they can stop her before 
   she leaves, but they are too late (the house is full of chirping 
   birds, which is a sly clue to the whole story). The killer drives the 
   Sheriff's car to the Butler House and leaves the flashing lights on. 
   Diane gets another call from &quot;Marianne&quot;, who tells her to 
   mention Christmas Eve, 1935 to her father. Tess arrives at the Butler 
   House and the killer tells her to take his hand, except he takes hers 
   by chopping it off. Diane digs through Charlie's newspaper archives 
   and comes up with some disturbing facts, which even affects her. In 
   1930, Wilfred's beloved wife died of tuberculosis. A short time 
   later, his daughter Marianne was raped (possibly by Wilfred himself) 
   and she had a baby, which turned out to be Jeffrey. Even more 
   disturning is that Wlfred Butler allowed his house to be used as a 
   mental institution, but the doctors and psychiatrists were more 
   interested in living the good life than curing their patients. 
   Wilfred made a big mistake a couple of years earlier by having 
   Marianne committed to the asylum (Jeffrey has always believed his 
   mother died at childbirth. He didn't even know his mother was 
   Marianne.). The rest of the story is purposely missing from Charlie's 
   archives and we soon find out why. Diane and Jeffrey find Charlie's 
   car burning and his dead body nearby (his hands were cut off). Diane 
   blames all the deaths of Jeffrey (Wouldn't you?), but the truth 
   finally comes out thanks to the long flashback sequence at the end if 
   the film. It seens on Christmas Eve, 1935, all the doctors were 
   getting drunk at the big hall table in the Butler House. Wilfred 
   thinks this is the perfect time to save his daughter&nbsp; and 
   release all the other patients, who have been<A HREF="invasion_of_the_blood_farmers_1972_silent_night_bloody_night_1972_dvd.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/invasion of the blood farmers-silent night bloody night dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   mistreated by their doctors (see if you can count the many Andy 
   Warhol Factory stars playing inmates and doctors. There is Candy 
   Darling, Ondine, Tally Brown, Lewis Love, Jack Smith and Susan 
   Rothenberg. Hell, even Mary Woronov got her start appearing in 
   Warhol's Factory films). Unfortunately, the inmates not only kill 
   their doctors, they mistake Marianne for one of the staff and kill 
   her, too. Wilfred is only able to escape with Jeffrey. Yes, you 
   guessed it, since 1935, the entire town has been occupied by crazy 
   people, who have procreated and filled the town with their equally 
   crazy offspring (Diane included). The inmates have taken over the 
   town. But over time, they have begun to live normal lives and 
   assimilate themselves into society. So just who exactly is the 
   killer? When Mayor Adams enters the Butler House, he and Jeffrey 
   shoot each other at the same time, both ending up dead. But neither 
   of them are the killers. The killer is none other than an 80 year-old 
   Wilfred Brown, who has been hiding himself in loony bins until the 
   day his house would be destroyed. He wanted the house to remain 
   standing forever to remind everyone from town exactly what they had 
   done. He faked his death in 1950 to see if Jeffrey was a man of his 
   word, and for 20 years he was, but he nows needs money and decided to 
   sell the house at a really reduced price (it is actually worth five 
   times more). It's too late for him. Since Jeffrey and everyone else 
   involved in Marianne's murder is dead, he goes after Diane, but she 
   kills him by shooting him with a revolver belonging to Jeffrey. A 
   year passes and we watch as bulldozers approach to destroy the Butler 
   House, but nothing will destroy Diane's memories. This is the first 
   time that I remember an octogenarian&nbsp; serial killer (even the 
   institution he lived in didn't know his name but, in the film's 
   biggest mistake, they could have mentioned his age) and

   theater in 1976 that people walked out during the attack scenes 
   because it just freaked them out. There were a lot of &quot;Ews!&quot;
    and &quot;Yucks&quot; being gasped in the audience and rightfully 
   so. This was a really effective little &quot;nature gone amuck&quot; 
   horror film about the unlikeliest of killers: Earthworms, or rather, 
   bloodworms, a breed of worm that can actually bite with pincers 
   attached to their mouths. That it was based on an actual incident 
   (but with a lot of liberties taken), just makes it all the <A HREF="squirm_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/squirm vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="288" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>more
    effective. The opening on-screen crawl explains it all: &quot;<B>Late
    in the evening of September 29, 1975, a sudden electrical storm 
   struck around a rural sea coast area of Georgia. Power lines, felled 
   by high winds, sent hundreds of thousands of volts surging into the 
   muddy ground, cutting off all electricity to the small, secluded town 
   of Fly Creek. During the period that followed the storm, the citizens 
   of Fly Creek experienced what scientists believe to be one of the 
   most bizarre freaks of nature ever recorded. This is the story....</B>&quot;
    We then view the opening credits, where a young girl on the 
   soundtrack sings an eerie song with lyrics such as &quot;I can hear 
   the dark coming up the stairs&quot; as we watch the storm knock down 
   an electrical tower, sending a live electrical wire to touch the over-soaked
    ground with over 300,000 volts of electricity (we will see that live 
   wire several times in the film), turning normal, everyday bloodworms 
   into murderous little killers We hear the worms scream (actually 
   electronically altered sounds of pigs squealing in a slaughterhouse) 
   and see them in extreme close-up thanks to excellent macrophotography 
   (which is very creepy and effective). The day after the storm, we 
   watch Geri Sanders (Patricia Pearcy; <B><A HREF="house_where_death_lives_1981.htm">THE
    HOUSE WHERE DEATH LIVES</A></B> - 1981) taking a&nbsp; shower, while 
   worm farm co-owner Roger (R.A. Dow; a stage actor, this being his 
   only film) cleans up debris on the front lawn of the Sanders' 
   farmhouse (reportedly in real life to be the most haunted house in 
   Georgia!) and gets an eyefull of Geri after she steps out of the 
   shower (he has an extreme crush on her). Geri's mother, Naomi (Jean 
   Sullivan, in her final film), who just lost her husband (and Geri's 
   father) a few months ago, is not too pleased that Northerner Mick 
   (Don Scardino; <B><A HREF="he_knows_youre_alone_1980.htm">HE KNOWS 
   YOU'RE ALONE</A></B> - 1980) is coming to visit Geri for five days. 
   Geri asks Roger if she can borrow his truck (which is full of 100,000 
   earthworms in the back) so she can pick up Mick, because the family 
   station wagon was not built to travel the rough back roads. He 
   reluctantly allows her, but Mick's bus is unable to get past a downed 
   tree five miles from Fly Creek, so the wise-assed bus driver tells 
   Mick to take a shortcut through the woods if he wants to get to Fly 
   Creek quicker. After nearly having a large tree branch fall on him 
   while taking a pee in the woods and falling into a water-filled hole, 
   he meets Geri on the road and they drive to town, where she has to 
   pick up a block of ice for home because the electricity is out. While 
   Geri is getting the ice, Mick stops in to get an eggcream from the 
   local eating establishment (he has to explain to the girl behind the 
   counter how to make it), only to discover one of the killer worms in 
   his drink. The counter girl blames Mick for playing a unfunny 
   practical joke (because he is a Northerner) and the Sheriff (Peter 
   MacLean; <B><A HREF="action.htm#ForceFive1981">FORCE: FIVE</A></B> - 
   1981) tells Mick to get out of the diner and wants to know what 
   business he has in town. Mick replies, &quot;No business, just 
   pleasure.&quot; and walks out. When Geri returns the truck, all of 
   the worms are missing, which pisses-off Roger's father, Willie (Carl 
   Dagenhart), who says, &quot;Cost me over $300, sonny boy!' to Mick, 
   but he blames Roger for the lost worms and chews him out in front of 
   Geri and Mick, which makes Roger hate Mick even more. Geri and Mick 
   take the station wagon to go antique shopping and stop at the home of 
   antique dealer Mr. Beardsley, but all they find is a skeleton in the 
   front yard that looks like it was picked clean. They bring the 
   Sheriff back, only to discover that the skeleton is gone (we find out 
   later Roger stole it and hid it in a shed). The Sheriff is not to 
   pleased with Mick and tells him to get out of town and then chastises 
   Geri and says, &quot;I have no time to book this little city weasel. 
   I have a town to put back together.&quot; He then turns to Mick and 
   says, &quot;If I see you one more time, you won't be able to call a 
   city lawyer...because all the phones are dead.&quot; Now that we have 
   the setup to the film out of the way, including introducing Geri's 
   younger smart-assed, pot-smoking sister Alma (Fran Higgins, in her 
   only film appearance), who comes on to Mick and relentlessly makes 
   fun of Roger (asking him earlier in the film, &quot;Where did you get 
   that shirt, Roger? Out robbing corpses again?&quot;) and their mother 
   Naomi acting a little psychotic over the loss of her husband, we get 
   down to the nitty-gritty: the bloodworm attacks. Mick, Geri &amp; 
   Roger take a boat to go fishing, but one of the worms bites Mick and 
   tries to burrow into his arm, so he goes to shore to treat it, 
   leaving Geri and Roger alone on the boat. Geri accidentally knocks 
   over the box of worms and when Roger tries to sexually attack her, 
   she knocks Roger to the floor of the boat, where the flesh-hungry 
   worms burrow into his face (once you see this scene, you will never 
   forget it). Roger and Geri go overboard, where Roger runs to shore, 
   screaming bloody murder. Mick discovers the missing skeleton in the 
   shed, so he and Alma break into the doctor's office and find x-rays 
   of Mr. Beardsley and discover that the skull is missing the same 
   three teeth as the x-ray. While Mick and Alma are doing this, Geri 
   goes home to take a shower, where worms start to slither out of the 
   showerhead, but they retract when Geri looks up. Geri meets Mick and 
   Alma, where they all share their stories about what just happened, so 
   Geri and Mick go to the worm farm, where Mick discovers the corpse of 
   Willie, his entire torso eaten away and full of hungry worms. They 
   hop in the car and go to see the Sheriff, but interrupt his spaghetti 
   dinner (symbolism alert!) with a floozy date. The Sheriff blows them 
   off because he's more interested in his dinner and scoring with his 
   floozy. While Mick, Geri, Alma and a weirded-out Naomi are eating 
   dinner, a tree crashes through the roof (the tree's roots eaten away 
   by the worms) but, thankfully, no one was injured, but the dining 
   room is destroyed (this all the more realistic because an actual tree 
   was dropped by a crane onto the set with the actors not using stunt 
   people! The fear on their faces is real.). Mick figures out that 
   light is the worms' kryptonite, so he heads out to get some plywood 
   to repair the damage before night falls. As he is returning back to 
   the house, he is attacked and knocked-out by a crazed, worm-riddled 
   Roger, who tells Mick he spoiled everything for him (He yells out, 
   &quot;You gonna be spoiled. You gonna be the wormface!&quot;). 
   Nighttime arrives and the worms attack the Sanders home and the town, 
   first making a meal out of the Sheriff and his floozy as they are 
   making love in a jail cell (!) and then attacking the town's bar, 
   Quigleys, killing all the patrons. Mick wakes up and makes a torch 
   out of his shirt to keep the worms at bay and heads back to save 
   Geri. Mick arrives to discover Naomi's corpse covered in worms and 
   must fight a deranged Roger, who has Geri tied-up in the attic. Mick 
   manages to throw Roger into the sea of worms covering the house's 
   first floor. but Roger's worm-infested body slithers upstairs and 
   nearly kills both Geri and Mick as they climb out a second floor window<A HREF="squirm_1976_blu-ray.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/squirm blu-ray front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="241" HEIGHT="286" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   and hide in a tree. Morning arrives and Geri and Mick are woken up by 
   a power company employee, who tells them the electricity has been 
   restored (therefore ending the murderous worm problem). Alma is also 
   discovered alive, as she was hiding from the worms in the house in a 
   cedar chest. Fall Creek can now go back to normal, minus a Sheriff 
   and a bunch of local drunks.&nbsp; This was the debut feature film by 
   director/writer Jeff Lieberman (<B><A HREF="blue_sunshine_1977.htm">BLUE

   his career as a director because most of his films are unusual gems, 
   including this one (Lieberman previously worked as an Associate 
   Producer on <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Death Hooker">WHO KILLED

   thriller <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Blade1972">BLADE</A></B> 
   [1972]). This one has many memorable scenes and still is able to 
   creep you out. Making worms scary is not an easy feat, but Lieberman 
   pulls it off in excellent fashion, using the macrophotography of the 
   screaming worms to jolt you and some very good special makeup effects 
   (by Bill Milling and multi-Academy Award&reg;-winner Rick Baker, who, 
   at the time of the writing of this review, officially announced his 
   retirement) to gross you out. The scene of Roger pulling worms out of 
   his face was censored from all TV prints and when theatrical 
   distributor American International cut the film by a minute for a 
   PG-Rated re-release, this scene was also deleted (along with a couple 
   of scenes of female topless nudity). This 92-minute version was 
   offered on VHS first by <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Vestron Video">Vestron

   watching this film. While there are a few speckles of dirt onscreen 
   here and there, the print is a revelation of details you may not have 
   noticed in previous versions. What makes the film even more special 
   is that only a handful of the actors on view were actually actors. 
   Most of them were locals from Port Wentworth, Georgia, where the film 
   was made, and it adds realism to the proceedings. Star Don Scardino 
   would have a healthy career as an actor, but reached far greater 
   success as a TV series director, which he continues to do today (he 
   also directed the theatrical film <B><A HREF="incredible_burt_wonderstone_2013.htm">THE

   than this film. Also starring William Newman, Barbara Quinn, Angel 
   Sande, Carol Jean Owens and Kim Iocouvozzi. The Blu-Ray also has a 
   wealth of new extras (as well as Lieberman's commentary from the MGM

   applying little or no DNR to the film prints, so they look like they

   catches poisonous snakes for their venom, which he sells to local Dr. 
   Everett (played by screenwriter Gary Crutcher) for research. Since 
   Tim never hurts the snakes he catches, he builds up a friendship with 
   them, especially a rattlesnake he calls Stanley. Tim butts heads with 
   local businessman Mr. Thomkins (the sleazy Alex Rocco), who wants Tim 
   to help him trap and kill snakes for their skins. Tim refuses 
   Thomkins' offer, partly because he was responsible for Tim's father's 
   death (he was shotgunned down, mistaken for an alligator!), partly 
   because because Thomkins is a raving racist (he calls Tim a 
   &quot;redstick&quot; ) and mostly because Tim likes snakes better 
   than people. Tim also supplies snakes to exotic dancer Gloria (Marcia 
   Knight), who uses them harmlessly in her act at a club run by her 
   money-grubbing husband Sidney (Rey Baumel). Tim also has to deal with 
   Thomkins' two right-hand men, Crail (singer Steve Alaimo) and Bob 
   (Mark Harris), who travel around the swamps capturing snakes for 
   skins. Tim gets into a fight with Crail and Bob (after catching them 
   with a truckload of snakes) and Bob gets bit in the ass by Stanley. 
   Tim reaches the breaking point after getting hit on all sides with 
   troubles that have to do with his snakes. Thomkins hires a loose 
   cannon called Psycho Simpson (Paul Avery) to help Crail and Bob with 
   their snake hunting. When Crail and Bob get caught in some quicksand 
   and Tim just watches them sink to the bottom, Psycho breaks into 
   Tim's house and kills Stanley's mate Hazel and their three offspring. 
   Psycho threatens Tim with an outboard motor but Stanley bites him on 
   the neck and kills him. Gloria is talked into biting the heads off 
   snakes in her act by her husband in hopes it will increase business 
   for his failing club. It does, but when Tim sees the act in the 
   packed club, he later kills both Gloria and Sid by throwing a bag of 
   snakes in their bed (in slow-motion, an effective scene) while they 
   plead for their lives. Tim then kidnaps Thomkins' daughter Susie 
   (Susan Carroll), who we see earlier is being hit on by her own father 
   with an incestuous leer, after she sees Tim kill her father by 
   filling his swimming pool with snakes. It is at this time the 
   audience is allowed to see that Tim is not the sympathetic hero we 
   thought him to be. He is actually quite psychopathic and the snakes 
   revolt when they see he has no respect for anyone but himself.

   concerned. When he realized that Tim is talking about snakes, his 
   look is absolutely hilarious.&nbsp; There are also copious amounts of 
   carnage, as we see snakes bite people, snakes themselves being killed 
   by shotgun, machete and having their heads bitten off. Add in the 
   incest angle and Tim's character at first portrayed as sympathetic 
   and eventually as psychotic and you get one strange film that would 
   not get a PG rating today, especially the scenes in the finale of Tim 
   killing live snakes by flinging them against the floor and walls 
   (it's clear they're not fakes). Hell, a film like this couldn't get 
   made today! In case you didn't know: I like this film a lot. I never 
   said I had good taste. WARNING: The only uncut version of this film

   name: Steve Gallon; <B><A HREF="petey_wheatstraw_1977.htm">PETEY WHEATSTRAW</A></B> 
   - 1977) stars as Steve, a &quot;nigger off the streets&quot; who is 
   kidnapped by crooks Bob (Benny Latimore) and Jim (Lee Cross) and 
   brought to the laboratory of dwarf mad scientist Dr. Dippy (Peter 
   Conrad, who can't speak a single line without tripping over his 
   tongue), who injects Steve with a new serum that gives him 
   supernormal powers, but unless he gets a neutralizer shot within one 
   week's time, he will die, There's one caveat: The neutralizer shot 
   has not been invented yet, but that means very little to Bob and Jim, 
   who want to use the superhuman Steve to pull-off a multi-million 
   dollar diamond heist and then let him die (this way, they don't have 
   to pay him his &quot;cut&quot;). Before any of that happens, we are 
   subjected to some of the most cheaply filmed dialogue and exposition 
   scenes that take up nearly three-quarters of the film's running time. 
   Steve is nothing but a wino (the first time we meet him, he's getting 
   the shit kicked out of him by three homeless guys for stealing a 
   newspaper!), but Dr. Dippy's beautiful black assistant, Peggy 
   (Joycelyn Norris), who is (naturally) a virgin, falls in love with 
   him and he deflowers her in a swanky apartment (I'm being kind here) 
   loaned to him by Jim (<B>Peggy:</B> &quot;Steve, don't hurt me with 
   that ring on your finger!&quot; <B>Steve:</B> &quot;Peggy, that's no 
   ring. It's the watch on my wrist!&quot;). After getting a shot of the 
   serum, Bob and Jim convince Steve to pull a &quot;practical joke&quot;
    on their friend, which turns out stealing a (Styrofoam) safe from a 
   jewelry store while Dr. Dippy and his girlfriend, the big-breasted 
   Monica (the obviously pseudonymous &quot;Wild Savage&quot;), keep the 
   saleswomen occupied by arguing over the price of a diamond engagement 
   ring (I never laughed so hard in my life!). When Bob tries to kill 
   Steve by shooting him in the face and the bullets just bounce-off 
   (&quot;Goddamn, this nigger is bulletproof!&quot;), Steve knocks-out 
   Bob, hides the diamonds under a huge (Styrofoam) boulder and heads to 
   Peggy's house, where he himself creates the neutralizer by putting 
   the ingredients in a flower vase and drinking it! Bob, Jim and Dr. 
   Dippy force Pe<A HREF="six_thousand_dollar_nigger_1979.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/six thousand dollar nigger ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>ggy
    and Steve at gunpoint to retrieve the diamonds, but the trio end up 
   shot dead ($100 to the first person who can tell me who shot Dr. 
   Dippy!) and Steve and Peggy live happily ever after with an on-screen 
   scrawl that promises &quot;This Nigger Is Coming Back&quot; (he 
   didn't).&nbsp; It's hard to describe how utterly cheap and ridiculous 
   this film really is. Director Rene Martinez (who also gave us <B><A HREF="road_of_death_1973.htm">ROAD
    OF DEATH</A></B> [1973], as well as the aforementioned <B>THE GUY 
   FROM HARLEM</B>) makes any Rudy Ray Moore film look polished and 
   professional in comparison. The acting is worse than amateurish 
   (especially Wildman Steve [who passed away in 2004] and Peter Conrad, 
   who smokes a cigar that is almost bigger than he is!) and the sets, 
   sound recording, editing, music and camerawork are all sub-level 70's 
   porn quality. What makes this film so watchable are the quotable 
   pieces of crazy (and racist) dialogue and silly sight gags 
   (screenplay written by Martinez and Laura S. Diaz). Wildman Steve 
   mainly does his dirty nightclub comedy act (&quot;A white woman once 
   offered me fifty dollars to 'knock her out'. I fucked her three times 
   and then hit her over the head with a brick!&quot;), but he says some 
   other crazy things like telling Jim's maid (Addie Williams), 
   &quot;Wash my butt, not my back!&quot; and &quot;Come in this water 
   and let's have a fuck!&quot; when he is taking a shower. My favorite 
   line is when he describes why marijuana is illegal, but homosexuality 
   is not, by saying, &quot;If you get caught with a joint in your 
   mouth, it better be connected to two balls!&quot; The fact that it 
   takes nearly two-thirds of the film's running time for Steve to do 
   anything slightly superhuman shows the cheapness of the production, 
   but when he proves his super-strength by bending an iron bar, lifting 
   and obvious Styrofoam safe (which supposedly weighs 2000 pounds!), 
   beating up (and killing) two of the three bums who picked on him when 
   he lived on the streets (in some of the worst fight choreography I've 
   ever seen) and then stealing the safe (it's the same safe that was in 
   Dr. Dippy's lab!) from the jewelry store (When he puts the safe in 
   the trunk of Bob's Cadillac, the shocks don't even move! Now that's 
   one well-built car!), you'll either laugh yourself silly or turn the 
   damn film off. There is no middle ground with this film. Either 
   you'll love it for its awful cheapness or you'll hate it for its 
   awful cheapness. Also starring John A. Jacobs, Larry Hannah, Eric 
   Gregory Gallon and Herbert Murray. A <A HREF="http://www.xenonpictures.com">Xenon

   pouring rain, as no taxi will stop to pick her up until she steps in 
   front of one (the taxi driver, played by Argento regular Fulvio 
   Mingozzi [<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Tenebre1982">TENEBRE</A></B> - 
   1982], refuses to get out of the cab to help her with her bags). Once 
   in the taxi, Suzy give the driver the address where she needs to go 
   and he takes her to the dance academy, an imposing old red building 
   (red is the primary color of this film) with a huge front double 
   door. As Suzy walks towards the door, student Pat Hingle (Eva Axen) 
   comes out of the door muttering something, but all Suzy can hear are 
   the words &quot;secrets&quot; and &quot;irises&quot;. Suzy rings the 
   doorbell and a female voice on the intercom tells her to go away, 
   even when Suzy gives her name, so she has no other choice but to get 
   back in the taxi and go to a hotel (the front door is locked). We 
   then follow Pat as she is running nervously in the rain, always 
   looking behind her. She arrives at friend Caroline's (Renata Zamengo; <B><A HREF="perfume_of_the_lady_in_black_1974.htm">THE
    PERFUME OF THE LADY IN BLACK</A></B> - 1974) apartment building and 
   Caroline tells her she is welcome to stay as long as she wants, as 
   long as she doesn't mind sleeping on the couch. All Pat will tell her 
   is that she was kicked out of school, not telling her why, but it is 
   obvious she is frightened of something or someone. When Pat uses the 
   bathroom, a gust of wind blows the window open, scaring the crap out 
   of Pat, but Caroline closes the window and tells her to relax. When 
   Caroline leaves the bathroom, the door slams shut and locks. Pat is 
   grabbed by an arm that bursts through the window, as Caroline tries 
   to get in, hearing Pat's screams fade, seemingly moving to the roof 
   of the apartment building, which leads Caroline to the lobby. 
   Suddenly, Pat's bloody body comes crashing through the lobby's 
   stained glass ceiling (an Argento trademark) and an electrical cord 
   wraps around her neck, hanging her, as she swings back and forth. We 
   then see Caroline lying dead on the lobby floor, her body impaled by 
   the falling stained glass.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   headmistress Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett; <B><A HREF="house_of_dark_shadows_1970.htm">HOUSE
    OF DARK SHADOWS</A></B> - 1970; in her final big screen appearance), 
   who introduces her to Miss Tanner (Alida Valli; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#KillerNun1978">KILLER
    NUN</A></B> - 1978), the strict woman who controls the classes and 
   the day-to-day activities. The police are also there investigating 
   Pat's death, so Suzy interjects, telling the police what she saw last 
   night. Madame Blanc tells Suzy that her room is not ready, so she is 
   having her stay with one of the students in town. Miss Tanner takes 
   Suzy to the locker room and introduces her to the other students. The 
   only two students of importance are Olga (Barbara Magnolfi; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SisterOfUrsula1978">THE
    SISTER OF URSULA</A></B> - 1978), a snotty girl whom Suzy is about

    WARHOL'S BAD</A></B> - 1977), another American student who is going 
   to be Suzy's best friend. Also at the academy are male student Mark 
   (popular Spanish singer Miguel Bose; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Star Knight">STAR
    KNIGHT</A></B> - 1986), who takes an instant shine to Suzy; and the 
   blind Daniel (Flavio Bucci; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#TexLordDeep1985">TEX
    AND THE LORD OF THE DEEP</A></B> - 1985), who walks around with the

   there's also someone else: a hulking silent servant named Pavlo 
   (Giuseppe Transocchi; <B><A HREF="black_jesus_1968.htm">BLACK JESUS</A></B> 
   - 1968), whom Miss Tanner tells Suzy had all his teeth pulled out so 
   he could be fitted with false teeth, which is why he smiles so much 
   (his dentist must have been a quack because his dentures are ill-fitting!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This is when the strange shit begins to happen. As Suzy walks out of 
   the recital room, she sees an ugly maid polishing silverware and one 
   item lights up and engulfs Suzy. The next day, Suzy goes to her first 
   dance class and passes out, waking up in a bed and being attended to 
   by Professor Verdegast (Renato Scarpa (<B><A HREF="dont_look_now_1973.htm">DON'T
    LOOK NOW</A></B> - 1973), who puts Suzy on a restricted diet and 
   tells her to drink a glass of wine when she first gets up and when 
   she retires for the night. Madame Blanc tells Suzy not to worry, her 
   room is now ready and Pavlo will make sure she eats right and have 
   her wine ready for her. Suzy never wanted to live in a dorm room, but 
   it is quite clear that she is being influenced by some unknown force 
   and that everything that happens to her happens for a reason.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    One night, while Suzy is brushing her hair, she finds maggots on her 
   brush, looks up and notices that a mass of maggots are falling from 
   the ceiling. As a matter of fact, all the female students come 
   screaming out of their dorm rooms, as maggots are falling on them, 
   too. Miss Tanner and Mark go to the attic and find a wooden crate 
   crawling with thousands of maggots. Miss Tanner tells the students 
   that the maggots came from a crate of food they ordered from a new 
   vendor, but no one bothers to ask why a crate of food is being stored 
   in the attic (That would be my first question!). Madame Blanc tells 
   them that everyone will be sleeping together on cots in the recital 
   hall, even the teachers, until an exterminator comes tomorrow to get 
   rid of the maggots. What happens next is pure WTF?!? cinema of the bizarre.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In the recital hall, the students are sleeping on one side of the 
   room while the teachers sleep on the other side, sheets hanging on 
   ropes separating them, Sara is awoken by a strange snoring noise and 
   Suzy says it is probably Madame Blanc, but Sara says it couldn't be, 
   all the teachers in the school live in town; they leave the school 
   precisely when dinner is over. So who's snoring on the other side of 
   the sheet? A couple of days later, Sara discovers that none of the 
   teachers live in town, so they must be staying somewhere in the 
   school, but where? Sara aims to find out, so when night comes and 
   everyone is asleep, she searches the school, only the school 
   apparently doesn't like it, leading Sara to a room full of razor 
   wire, which she becomes trapped in. The more she struggles, the more 
   painful it becomes for her (and the viewer), leading to her death. 
   The next morning, Miss Tanner tells Suzy that Sara suddenly left the 
   school earlier in the morning, but Suzy doesn't believe her because 
   Sara would have least have said goodbye to her. Suzy calls Sara's 
   guardian, Dr. Frank Mandel (a dubbed Udo Kier; <B><A HREF="#MarkOfTheDevil1970">MARK
    OF THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1970), who tells Suzy that Sara said nothing 
   to him about leaving school and he thinks Suzy should know the 
   history of the school she is attending.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    In 1895, a witch by the name of Helena Markos moved into the 
   building before it became a dance academy. She wrote several books on 
   witchcraft under the name &quot;The Black Queen&quot;, but she was 
   constantly persecuted by people in town. In 1905, Helena burned to 
   death when the building mysteriously caught fire and burned to the 
   ground. It was rebuilt and turned into a dance academy, but it was 
   plagued with unexplainable deaths and other supernatural occurrences, 
   some people believing that Helena never died in the fire and she is 
   now looking for a successor, which she has not found...yet. After 
   hearing that story and finding it hard to swallow, Suzy decides to 
   search the school herself, but she is not going to like what she 
   finds. Is history about to repeat itself?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While the film doesn't make much sense (screenplay by Argento and 
   Daria Nicolodi, who has a quick cameo as a woman at the airport), <A HREF="suspiria_1977.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/suspiria italy poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>there's
    no denying that it has a style unlike any film that came before or 
   after it. Many films tried to copy it, but failed and there can only 
   be one reason why. Only Dario Argento can deliver an Argento film. 
   The first thing you'll notice is Argento's use of primary colors, 
   which permeate this film. There's a reason why red is the primary 
   color most used and I don't think I have to explain why (Only Mario 
   Bava, who directed such films as <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackSabbath1963">BLACK
    SABBATH</A></B> [1963], <B><A HREF="blood_and_black_lace_1964.htm">BLOOD
    AND BLACK LACE</A></B> [1964] and <B><A HREF="kill_baby_kill_1966.htm">KILL,
    BABY...KILL</A></B> [1966] could trump Argento when it came to the 
   use of color). The killings are also shocking, including Daniel 
   getting his throat ripped out by his guide dog, Pat and Caroline's 
   deaths and especially Sara's death by razor wire, all of them painful 
   to watch. What more can I say about this film that hasn't been said 
   before? This film forever changed the way we look at supernatural 
   horror films and its influence is felt, even today. This was also the 
   first film that the &quot;Goblins&quot; scored musically and it is 
   really intense and effective at eliciting an atmosphere of terror and 
   dread (Argento played the score during filming to get the proper 
   responses from his actors, as the film was lensed MOS [without sound] 
   and would be dubbed later in post-production). Be aware that though 
   this film is about &quot;Mater Suspiriorum&quot; (The &quot;Mother of 
   Sighs&quot;), her name is never uttered here and is first mentioned 
   at the beginning of <B><A HREF="inferno_1980.htm">INFERNO</A></B> 
   (1980). Here she is only mentioned by her earthly name, Helena 
   Markos. The actress portraying Helena, Lela Svasta, was, according to 
   Jessica Harper, a 90-year old ex-prostitute that Argento found on the 
   street. Now I don't know if that is true, but there's no denying that 
   her visage packs a visceral punch.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Larry Benjamin (Kaufman) is trying to make his gore masterpiece, but 
   a female serial killer begins murdering cast and crew members in 
   increasingly bloodier and gorier ways (The film opens with her 
   tearing-off a chauvinistic guy's leg and beating him to death with it 
   and then ripping a sunbathing pregnant woman's baby out of her womb 
   and running away with it!). Larry not only has to deal with the rash 
   of killings, but also the difficult cast and crew of the film, 
   including diva star Christine (Debbie Rochon; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#ChainsawCheerleader">CHAINSAW
    CHEERLEADERS</A></B> - 2008); her white trash boyfriend D.J. (Mario 
   Diaz); extremely strong boom mike handler Casey (Will Keenan); 
   special effects technician Jerry (Trent Haaga; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Ghouls 2003">THE
    GHOULS</A></B> - 2003); shy gofer Jennifer (Alyce LaTourelle) and 
   other assorted n<A HREF="terror_firmer_1999.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/terror firmer dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>itwits,
    halfwits and twits who make creating a movie look like a fraternity 
   toga party gone out of control (and, yes, there's a toga party in 
   this film!). When soundman The Toddster (Gary Hrbeck) walks off the 
   film, he is later murdered by the mysterious female killer when she 
   stabs him repeatedly about his head and chest with a broken bong 
   (this is after she shoves a funnel up his ass and gives him a bong 
   water and cocaine enema!) and then ripping out his brains with her 
   bare hands (and doing a &quot;This is your brain on drugs&quot; PSA 
   parody). Larry also has a young daughter named Audrey (Lloyd's 
   real-life daughter Charlotte Kaufman) who was struck dumb when she 
   witnessed her mother being killed during a stampede at a taping of 
   The Jerry Springer Show (her mother's head is trampled over and over 
   until it is just bloody mush). While Larry is trying to finish the 
   film, whose script gets changed daily, he's also trying to teach 
   Audrey how to speak again. There's also a competition between Casey 
   and Jerry for Jennifer's affection, which Casey wins due to his 
   unusual strength (he keeps beating-up and humiliating Jerry) and his 
   unusual love of pickles. As the murders continue, including the 
   killing of the film's financial backer, Jacob Gelman (portly Troma 
   regular Joel Fleishaker), who is graphically torn apart by an 
   escalator (!), it becomes clear that Jennifer has a deadly sexual 
   secret she is hiding from the crew (her sex scene with Jerry is one 
   for the books). But is she the killer or could it be another 
   crewmember that has a much more serious problem? Maybe the jar of 
   pickled red herring is a clue? The entire crew bands together to 
   defeat the killer in the film's blood-soaked (and painful) finale, 
   which ends with an impassioned speech about independent filmmaking 
   that is both inspiring and hilarious.&nbsp; In <B><A HREF="terror_firmer_1999b.htm">TERROR
    FIRMER</A></B>, there is no joke so juvenile or sight gag so low 
   that Lloyd Kaufman won't use it on screen. You want people shitting 
   their pants in graphic detail? It's in the movie. You want to see a 
   guy throwing up and then immediately kissing his girlfriend? It's 
   here. How about jokes about A.I.D.S., shameless self-promotion of 
   other Troma films, a cameo by Lemmy of Motorhead (C'mon, Lemmy, a 
   doctor could probably remove that fucking mole! But then he wouldn't 
   really be Lemmy, would he?), fart, pissing, puking and shitting sight 
   gags, ventriloquist dummy crucifixion, penis stretching, references 
   to <B><A HREF="seinfeld_tv_series.htm">SEINFELD</A></B>, <B><A HREF="jaws_1975.htm">JAWS</A></B> 
   and too many other TV shows and blockbuster films to take-in in one 
   viewing? All here. The funny thing is, a lot of this stuff is 
   actually funny and sometimes side-splittingly so. There is also 
   plenty of full-frontal nudity on view, both male and female (and 
   transgendered) and some of it approaches porn level, but it is done 
   so over-the-top, you can't possibly be offended by it. Yet for all of <B>TERROR
    FIRMER</B>'s excesses (and there are plenty), Patrick Cassidy, 
   Douglas Buck and Kaufman's screenplay (inspired by Kaufman and James 
   Gunn's book, &quot;<B>All I Need To Know About Filmmaking I Learned 
   From The Toxic Avenger</B>&quot;) is still a biting satire on 
   ultra-low-budget independent filmmaking, including the camaraderie, 
   in-fighting and unexpected setbacks, and it still finds time to have 
   a cohesive murder mystery plot. And, surprise, it's not really that 
   easy to solve; and the rest of the story is linear and resolves most 
   of the major plot points (including Audrey's speech problem). If it's 
   a tad overlong at two hours (slightly over two hours if you play the 
   film with all the excised bits, a special DVD feature), there is so 
   much going on both in the forefront and the background, time will fly 
   right by. The gore is plentiful (and very well done), the women are 
   beautiful and the jokes non-stop. What more could you ask for? Also 
   starring Yaniv Sharon, Sheri Wenden, Mo Fischer, Lyle Derek, Roy 
   David, Brigida Costa, and funny cameos by Ron Jeremy, Joe Franklin,

   (1986) -</B> Cult horror comedy from Executive Producer Charles Band 
   and his late, lamented Empire Pictures production outfit (Band would 
   form Full Moon Pictures after Empire went belly-up). When the planet 
   Pluton's Creature Disposal Unit accidentally beams an alien criminal 
   off the planet, the transmission is picked-up by a newly installed 
   satellite TV dish (&quot;The Do It Yourself 100&quot;) belonging to 
   the wacky Putterman family, which included dad Stanley (Gerrit 
   Graham; <B><A HREF="phantom_of_the_paradise_1974.htm">PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE</A></B> 
   - 1974); mom Raquel (Mary Woronov; <B><A HREF="eating_raoul_1982.htm">EATING

   everyone else is out of the house (Mom and Dad are at a swinger's 
   party and Suzy is on a date with her punker boyfriend), Grampa and 
   Sherman watch an all-night monster movie marathon hosted by Medusa 
   (Jennifer Richards, who wears a wig made of plastic snakes), only to 
   have a real monster come out of the TV and kill Grampa (by liquefying 
   him) in front of Sherman's eyes. Sherman calls the police, but they 
   think it's a crank call and when his<A HREF="terrorvision_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/terrorvision british dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="183" HEIGHT="286" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   parents come home with another swinging couple (played by Alejandro 
   Ray and Randi Brooks), Mom locks Sherman in Grampa's fallout shelter 
   to shut him up (Terrific parenting, Mom!). It's not long before the 
   monster makes quick meals out of Mom and Dad and the other swinging 
   couple (Rey's character turns out to be bisexual, but leaning more to 
   gay!), so Sherman makes another call to the cops and one to Medusa 
   and when they both blow him off, he blows the door on the fallout 
   shelter using Grampa's WWII explosives, just as Suzy returns home 
   with her punk rocker boyfriend O.D. (Jonathan Gries; <B><A HREF="fright_night_part_2_1988.htm">FRIGHT
    NIGHT PART 2</A></B> - 1988). The monster attacks, but stops in it's 
   tracks when it sees O.D.'s studded armband (a flashback shows that it 
   reminds the monster of it's kind owner back on the planet Pluton), so 
   Sherman and Suzy don studded armbands, too, and attempt to 
   domesticate the monster. The trio plan on making a million bucks off 
   the monster, so Sherman calls Medusa again and Suzy talks her into 
   coming to the Putterman home to look at the monster. Things go 
   horribly wrong when Officer Nutky (Ian Patrick Williams) shows up to 
   arrest Sherman for making crank calls and the monster eats both O.D. 
   and Nutky. Pluthar (William Paulson), a friendly alien from the 
   planet Pluthon, beams through the TV screen to save Sherman and Suzy, 
   but Medusa sees him as competition and kills him, which leads to the 
   film's bitterly funny conclusion. Let's just say that when Medusa 
   hosts her next horror marathon, the monsters in the films she will be 
   showing will pale in comparison to the hostess.&nbsp; This is one of 
   the better horror comedies to come out of the mid-80's, thanks to 
   director Ted Nicolaou's (<B><A HREF="subspecies_1991.htm">SUBSPECIES</A></B>

    THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL</A></B> (1982; What do you feed a starving 
   monster? Everything!) and our never ending obsession with TV. John 
   Carl Buechler's life-size creature is a ridiculous concoction of 
   sharp teeth, big eyes, a huge crab claw and plenty of latex and 
   slime, but it totally works in the framework of this wacky universe. 
   Besides a quick shot of the planet Pluton in the beginning of the 
   film (look closely and you'll see the wrecked remains of <B><A HREF="star_trek_1966.htm">STAR
    TREK</A></B>'s USS Enterprise in a junkyard), the entire film is set 
   within the confines of the colorful Putterman home, which includes 
   one of the biggest indoor hot tubs I have ever seen (It plays an 
   important part in the death of Alejandro Ray and Randi Brooks). The 
   sets are a masterwork of primary colors (filmed on stages in Rome, 
   Italy) and offer every excess the coke-fueled 80's had to offer. 
   While some of the effects are disgusting, you will notice the total 
   lack of blood here. When people are killed, they simply dissolve into 
   a puddle of ooze. Sure, some of the humor seems forced and dated, but 
   everyone plays it so broadly, it's hard not to fall for it's many 
   charms (Grampa, who sells lizard tails on the sidewalk, expounds the 
   eating of the tails by saying, &quot;You cut it off, eat it and it 
   grows back. And you can eat that one, too!&quot; He may have 
   something there.). This actually got a theatrical release through 
   Band's Empire Pictures distribution arm and shortly thereafter 
   obtained a VHS release from <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Lightning Video">Lightning

    Count Frederic Regula (Christopher Lee; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HorrorCastle1963">HORROR
    CASTLE</A></B> - 1963) is drawn and quartered for sacrificing twelve 
   young female virgins (He is fitted with a spiked mask [the spikes are 
   on the inside!]&nbsp; so he suffers before he dies), but before he 
   loses all four of his limbs, he curses Roger von Marienberg (Lex 
   Barker; <A HREF="invisible_dr_mabuse_1962.htm"><B>THE INVISIBLE DR. MABUSE</B></A> 
   - 1962) and all his descendants for sentencing him to such a gruesome death.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Thirty-five years pass and stranger Roger Mont Elise (Barker again) 
   arrives in a village and gets the attention of a one-legged man, who 
   was at Count Regula's drawn-and-quartering and is giving the 
   villagers a history of Count Regula (he performs in a traveling 
   show). He delivers a personal written invitation to Robert from 
   &quot;Graf von Andomai&quot;, to meet him at his castle on Friday. 
   The message also goes on to state that von Andomai will tell him 
   about his family line. Roger is intrigued because, even though he is 
   rich, he doesn't have an idea who he is, as he never met his mother 
   or father and knows nothing about his family line. Robert tells his 
   coachman (Dieter Eppler) to head to the castle. They arrive in the 
   village square where Count Regula was killed, but they are lost. 
   Robert asks several villagers for directions to the castle and all of 
   them turn away scared, not saying a word. Roger then meets priest 
   Father Fabian (Vladimir Medar; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#CastleCreepFlesh68">CASTLE
    OF THE CREEPING FLESH</A></B> - 1968), who offers Robert directions 
   if he can come along for the ride, because he has a baptism to 
   perform on a young boy along the way. Robert agrees and they go on 
   their way, but not before they witness a strange ritual to ward off 
   evil, where an old man walks through the village dragging a huge 
   wooden crucifix (much in the same way Christ did before he was 
   crucified). While making the long trip, Roger and Father Fabian meet 
   Baroness Lilian von Brabant (<A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_2.htm#KarinDor">Karin
    Dor</A>; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#AssignmentTerror69">ASSIGNMENT
    TERROR</A></B> - 1969) and her charge Babette (Christiane 
   R&uuml;cker). Lillian (who likes to be called Lily, so I will, too) 
   has also received a written invitation to the castle from the 
   one-legged man, only her message states that Graf von Andomai will 
   tell her about the inheritance she is about to recieve, since her 
   parents recently passed away under mysterious circumstances. What 
   happens next cements this film as one of the most atmospheric horror 
   flicks of all time. As night approaches, the Coachman sees the 
   strangest forest in film history. Every tree has human body parts 
   protruding from it, as if the trees swallowed people whole, growing 
   around them (Once seen, never forgotten).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Coachman tells Roger that he wants to turn around, but he orders 
   him to proceed forward. The Coachman then has a heart attack and 
   dies, falling off the carriage, frightened to death from what he has 
   just seen. Lily and Babette are then kidnapped by the castle's butler 
   Anatol (Carl Lange; <B><A HREF="creature_with_the_blue_hand_1967.htm">CREATURE
    WITH THE BLUE HAND</A></B> - 1967) and when Robert and Father Fabian 
   get to the castle, they find Lily in a trance and Babette hanging 
   over a pit, where the bottom is full of spikes. Father Fabian frees 
   Babette and Anatol tells Robert that he saved the women from highway 
   robbers (not even trying to explain Babette's predicament!). Anatol 
   tells Robert that Count Regula will see him tonight (<B>Robert:</B> 
   &quot;The Count has been dead for thirty-five years!&quot; <B>Anatol:</B> 
   &quot;He will rise from the dead to talk to you!&quot;). We then find 
   out that Father Fabian is not a priest at all, he is a thief that was 
   looking to rob the castle, but he will have to put that on hold for 
   the moment, since everyone's lives are in deadly danger. Anatol, who 
   proves to Father Fabian that he is one of the living dead (Father 
   Fabian puts a bullet in his chest and we see the bullet hole heal by 
   itself, thanks to some nifty stop-motion animation), shows everyone 
   the drawn and quartered corpse of Count Regula in a glass coffin, 
   telling them that the Count will rise from the dead on Good Friday, 
   which is today. The Count then rises from the dead and everyone 
   watches his dismembered limbs reattach themselves to his body (more 
   stop-motion animation). Count Regula tells Lily and Roger that he 
   needed the blood of thirteen virgins to become immortal, but he was 
   killed before he could kill his thirteenth virgin. Since he drank the 
   blood of the twelve virgins he killed before he was drawn and 
   quartered, he only needs one more and that person is...Lily. The 
   Count tells Lily that she is related to Roger and at midnight he will 
   drink her blood. Roger tries to intervene, but he is gassed, waking 
   up tied to the floor while the sharp blade of a huge pendulum inches 
   closer to his torso on every swing (the opening credits say the film 
   is based on Edgar Allan Poe's 'The Pit And The Pendulum&quot;, but 
   only this sequence bears any similarity). Will Roger escape this 
   deadly trap and save Lily, who is trying to save him, but is caught 
   in another trap, where the floor is disappearing under her, a pit of 
   snakes beneath her? Will Count Regula get his vengeance on Roger and 
   Lily's family and become immortal?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    What shocks me the most in watching this film for the first time in 
   widescreen is how much visual information was lost on the fullscreen 
   versions, especially the memorable trip through the haunted forest. 
   Director Harald Reinl (he was married to Karin Dor when this film was 
   made), who is best known for the series of German Edgar Wallace films 
   he directed during the early-to-mid-'60s (<B><A HREF="carpet_of_horror_1962.htm">THE

   film out of the park, hardly ever delivering a false note. While not 
   particularly bloody (pay attention to how Reinl handles the Count 
   being drawn and quartered), this film still has many grotesque 
   sights, including the trek through the forest and Robert discovering 
   the one-legged man's dead body in the castle's barn. There's also no 
   nudity (this was 1967, after all), but it comes damn close, showing 
   the naked, dead bodies of the twelve virgins, all their breasts (and 
   other private parts) hidden by objects or by the way their bodies are 
   posed (I froze the DVD on this scene to see if Reinl tried to sneak 
   in some nudity but, no, all of their naked bodies were placed in 
   strategic positions. It must have taken a lot of planning to film 
   this sequence, because the camera is always moving.). It's the little 
   things like this, that most people wouldn't notice, that makes this 
   film so special to me (and makes people believe they saw more than 
   there really was to see!). Lex Barker (who passed away in 1973) is 
   his normal stiff self, but he makes a serviceable action hero (he 
   once played Tarzan in a series of films during the late-'40s &amp; 
   early-'50s). One thing about this film did bother me, though: If Lily 
   is related to Roger, why does he give her a long passionate kiss in 
   the finale? It's definitely not a kiss an uncle would give his niece! 
   I guess that is a subject for another film (such as <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Byleth1972">BYLETH:

   a real strange one, folks. Part giallo mystery, part horror flick and 
   part mondo travelogue, this Haiti-lensed film offers a lot of good 
   stuff for fans of Italian genre movies; namely, plenty of 
   full-frontal nudity (By both men and woman. The only time I have seen 
   more penises is when I mistakenly rented a gay porn film!), plenty of 
   bloody, gory deaths (there is one murder that is so graphic, you will 
   not forget it as long as you live) and, unfortunately, real life 
   animal slaughter disguised as a way of life for Haiti's voodoo 
   community. There's also a major character in this film that is quite 
   unlike any<A HREF="tropic_of_cancer_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/tropic of cancer 1972 poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="229" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   other in Italian genre films. He's another aspect of this film that 
   makes it unforgettable.&nbsp; It's really hard to explain what is 
   going on here, but I will do my best to describe it to you.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Fred Wright (Gabriele Tinti; <B><A HREF="death_occurred_last_night_1970.htm">DEATH
    OCCURRED LAST NIGHT</A></B> - 1970) and his beautiful wife Grace 
   (Anita Strindberg; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WhoSawHerDie">WHO SAW HER DIE?</A></B> 
   - 1972) land in Port Au Prince, Haiti under the guise of going on 
   vacation and working on their troubled marriage. It's obvious Fred is 
   there for another reason, but I'll get to that later. Fred is a real 
   hothead, a man who gets angry at the drop of a hat, even over little 
   things such as blocks of ice falling off a truck as he and his wife 
   arrive at their hotel, the El Rancho (Okay, I guess that is not a 
   little thing, but he yells to the driver of the truck, &quot;You 
   should be shot for your stupidity!&quot;). While Fred is yelling at 
   the driver, Grace looks at him with lust in her eyes (She has a thing 
   for black men, which will be revealed in an eye-opening sequence 
   later in the film). Also at the hotel is Garner (Stelio Candelli; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#KillerWoreGloves74">THE
    KILLER WORE GLOVES</A></B> - 1974), who is in Haiti for the same 
   reason as Fred, but neither one of them knows it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We are then introduced to Dr. Williams (Anthony Steffen; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#NightEvelynGrave71">THE
    NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE</A></B> - 1971), a brilliant 
   scientist who invented a new hallucinogenic aphrodisiac that will 
   make millions for anyone who owns the formula, but there is a major 
   problem. Two of Dr. Williams' assistants stole the formula four weeks 
   ago and disappeared. Without the formula, Williams cannot create any 
   more of the drug, but he doesn't seem too worried, because he is 
   content being a doctor at a local hospital who takes care of his 
   patients. The locals love him, as do the police. He is going to need 
   that love because someone wearing black gloves is killing everyone 
   Dr. Williams knows and he may very well be next. We first see 
   Williams in his office at home, when he gets a phone call from one of 
   his missing assistants, Douglas, who sounds overwrought, begging 
   Williams to meet him immediately, even offering to give the formula 
   back. When Williams leaves his home to meet Douglas, we can see he 
   was not alone in his house; also inside is the black-gloved killer, 
   who rifles through Dr Williams' office looking for something and not 
   finding it. Care to guess what that is? (Dr. Williams' office is full 
   of dead spiders, which are kept pinned behind glass-encased frames 
   like someone's bug collection.) When Williams arrives at the location 
   to meet Douglas, he seems not to be there, not answering Williams' 
   call for him. Williams searches the place and finds Douglas dead, his 
   skin as white as snow.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We are then introduced to the obese white-haired Mr. Peacock (Gordon 
   Felio; <B><A HREF="do_you_like_women_1964.htm">DO YOU LIKE WOMEN?</A></B> 
   - 1964; a cannibal comedy written by Roman Polanski!), an obviously 
   gay man who is sitting by the edge of the hotel's pool, while his 
   personal &quot;assistant&quot;, Jean-Paul (Pierre Richard Merceron) 
   rubs suntan lotion on his back (Once you see Peacock, you will never 
   forget him, I was going to describe him as looking like a Cabbage 
   Patch Doll until my friend Steve mentioned that he is a <A HREF="tropic_of_cancer_1972_mr_peacock_before_&amp;_after_photo.htm">dead
    ringer for the kid</A> in <B><A HREF="bad_santa_2003.htm">BAD SANTA</A></B> 
   [2003] if he were all grown up. Truer words were never spoken!). Mr. 
   Peacock then jumps in the pool with some naked cabana boys and an 
   equally naked Jean-Paul, telling them to join him before the water 
   gets too warm (The blocks of ice we saw earlier in the film are put 
   in the pool to cool down the water in Haiti's sweltering heat!). 
   Later in his office, Mr. Peacock talks to Garner, telling him that 
   his proposition is &quot;delightful&quot;, but it won't be easy to 
   convince Williams because he's a very strange man. &quot;His idealism 
   is like an affliction&quot;, says Peacock. He tells Garner that 
   Williams is very kind and quite committed to his work as a doctor; he 
   once cured one of his &quot;beauties&quot; (Peacock lives up to his 
   name because his &quot;beauties&quot; are his collection of living 
   peacocks he keeps as pets. One is by his side as he talks to 
   Garner!), so he sent Williams a stuffed peacock out of gratitude. 
   &quot;He saves birds, animals and children&quot;, says Peacock. 
   Garner says he will put the pressure on Williams; &quot;My clients 
   will be happy to let us handle this in our own way.&quot; His clients 
   want their hands on the &quot;merchandise&quot; as soon as possible, 
   telling Peacock that they may get anxious if it takes too long. 
   Peacock says he understands, &quot;But a matter of this magnitude 
   needs both time and tact.&quot; Garner is worried that someone else 
   may be after the formula and stealing it away from his clients. 
   Peacock assures him not to worry, he understands this country and 
   knows how to handle Williams. Garner says a hallucinogen with those 
   potentials is money in the bank; the market is ready and waiting. He 
   promises Peacock that his take will be more than enough, so he is 
   counting on him to deliver the formula.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Dr. Williams is in the crowd at a cockfight, when he notices a drug 
   dealer named Oca (Fred Ade) in the audience staring at him intensely. 
   When they lock eyes. Oca leaves the cockfight quickly, with Williams 
   chasing him close behind.&nbsp; Oca runs in to a disco, grabs a woman 
   and dances with her, his face buried in her shoulder. Williams then 
   grabs him, punches him in the face and demands to know where his 
   second missing assistant, Crotz (Richard Osborne), is. After a few 
   more punches to his face, Oca runs away and hides in a cabana where a 
   naked couple is making love. When Williams opens the door, Oca tries 
   to stab him with a switchblade, but Williams disarms him and once 
   again asks where Crotz is. Oca tells him where he can find Crotz and 
   also says that Crotz is meeting someone tonight, but he doesn't know who.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Fred and Grace are driving down a busy Port Au prince road when Fred 
   mentions that he wants to visit his old friend, Dr. Williams, telling 
   Grace that he is a doctor, biologist and a philosopher &quot;but he's 
   kind of a has-been.&quot; Williams let fantastic opportunities slip 
   out of his hands and he's happy having nothing (That's not a 
   has-been, that's a content man!).&nbsp; Fred and Grace drive to 
   Williams' house only to discover his home is huge and foreboding, 
   like a haunted house (Grace says, &quot;It looks like something out 
   of Charles Addams!&quot;). When Fred rings the doorbell and no one 
   answers, they go on their way. Grace has no idea that her husband is 
   also after the formula and he is willing to do anything, even 
   sacrifice her well being to get it. When their car is rear-ended by 
   another car, Fred goes into one of his fits, but Dr. Williams 
   suddenly appears to calm him down. Grace invites him to have dinner 
   with them tonight and he agrees. As they drive away, the Police 
   Inspector (Bob Lemoine) pulls up to Williams in his car and tells him 
   that they found Douglas, dead. Williams plays stupid, even when the 
   Inspector tells him that there was something strange about the 
   condition of Douglas' corpse. It's as if the body contained water 
   rather than blood. Williams wryly says, &quot;We call that an anemic 
   condition&quot; and the Inspector smiles, telling him if he hears 
   anything from Crotz to give him a call, then he drives away.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Williams, Fred and Grace are about to have drinks at the pool, when 
   Garner, who is at the pool, yells out that he was just bitten by a 
   spider (It's apparent Garner did deep background on Williams and 
   knows about his years studying spiders, even being ballsy enough to 
   purposely getting bitten by a very poisonous spider just to get close 
   to Williams!). Williams runs up to him, sees the spider that bit him 
   and pulls out a syringe out of his medical bag, while the hotel's 
   manager, Mr. Philips (Umberto Raho; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#FlowerDeadlySting73">THE
    FLOWER WITH THE DEADLY STING</A></B> - 1973), captures the spider. 
   Williams inserts the syringe into the spider's mouth and sucks out 
   the venom (shown in extreme close-up), which he then injects into 
   Garner. Within a few moments Garner is feeling better and to show his 
   (fake) gratitude, he invites Williams, Fred and Grace to join him and 
   Mr. Peacock for dinner, which they gladly accept. At the dinner table 
   in the hotel's restaurant, Williams explains how he studied spiders 
   for many years, but quit when it became &quot;too dangerous for my 
   line of work.&quot; A friend of Garner's, Mr. Pratt (Alfio Nicolosi), 
   stops by the table to invite everyone over to his table after dinner 
   for champagne. As he walks back to his table, Williams give Mr. Pratt 
   a long, angry stare. Grace then mentions that she is fascinated by 
   voodoo, so Williams gives everyone at the table a history lesson on 
   the subject, likening voodoo to Catholicism (or, rather,<A HREF="tropic_of_cancer_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/tropic of cancer 1972 italy poster8a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="299" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   anti-Catholicism). Williams then sees a man sitting alone at a table 
   and excuses himself, walking to the front desk an telling them to 
   page a person (We can't hear the person's name because someone at the 
   front desk is stepping on his dialogue; and, as we will find out 
   later, this was done purposely). Williams then walks outside and 
   waits for the man to appear, but when he doesn't, Williams walks back 
   inside and finds the man's dead body hidden behind some plants. Also 
   on the body is a strange-looking small wooden object (it looks like 
   an eye), so Williams pockets it and walks back to the table, telling 
   no one about the dead body. Grace begs Williams to take her to a 
   voodoo ritual, so everyone gets up from the table to join Grace while 
   Williams takes them all to a genuine voodoo ritual.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Once at the ritual, they see a bunch of topless native women dancing 
   in a circle around the sacrifice - a bull. When the (quite sexual) 
   dance is over (It is obvious by they way their breasts flop around 
   that none of their titties are fake or augmented!), the voodoo priest 
   stabs the bull in the back of its neck with a sharp dagger. When the 
   bull falls to the ground, the priest then slits the bull's throat and 
   collects the gushing blood in a bowl, which everyone will take a 
   drink of. The priest then cuts off the bull's penis and throws it on 
   the bull's dead body, as the women fight over it, taking bites and 
   eating it!&nbsp; (If you get queasy by real-life animal deaths, I 
   recommend you don't watch this sequence, as it is pretty graphic). 
   The women then go into a frenzy, falling to the ground and twitching 
   wildly, as if they were having a grand mal seizure. Then all the men 
   dance in a circle around the dead bull, but one of the men happens to 
   be Oca, who then falls to the ground, dead. Williams tells Fred to 
   get a knife and Williams then cuts Oca's leg open, telling Fred that 
   there's not any blood coming out of the wound, just a water-like 
   substance. Fred asks how that could be and Williams says, &quot;Who 
   knows the answer? Whenever a man tries to go beyond the accepted 
   limits, the spirits punish him.&quot; Williams is obviously lying, 
   because he realizes that Oca was using his new wonder drug, just like 
   Douglas was. Both of their bodies lack blood, but where did Oca get 
   the drug? When Williams goes home, he is attacked by Mr. Pratt's 
   &quot;assistant&quot;, Murdock (actor unknown). Sitting on a chair is 
   Mr. Pratt, who says, &quot;I'm sorry I had to hurt you Doctor. I 
   never use these methods because I'm a businessman.&quot; When 
   Williams tells him they have no business to talk about, Murdock gives 
   him a couple of kick to his ribs and then beats the crap out of him. 
   When Williams still refuses to do business with him, Mr. Pratt gives 
   him 48 hours to change his mind or else he is a dead man. While 
   Williams is doing rounds in the hospital, Mr. Peacock tells him that 
   a friend of his, a representative from an important chemical firm, 
   has come all the way from Boston to talk to him. Williams tells 
   Peacock that he is not interested, because &quot;at the present I'm 
   only interested in being a doctor.&quot; Peacock says he sees no 
   wrong in profiting from the fruits of his labors and Williams is 
   steadfast (That's what I like about him!), telling Peacock once again 
   that he's not interested, even when Peacock makes a veiled threat to 
   expose the condition of Douglas' body. The biggest problem I have is 
   this: Why is everyone after this new miracle drug when it's apparent 
   it has very deadly side effects? It's a fair question, one I hope is 
   answered before the film concludes.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Peacock goes back to his opulent home and tells a waiting Garner 
   that Williams won't cooperate. Peacock has the feeling that Williams 
   wants to protect someone, even himself. Garner believes it a bluff 
   and that someone else has gotten to Williams. Garner believes that 
   whoever finds Crotz will get the formula (he's not as stupid as he 
   looks). Garner tells Peacock to find Crotz and he will deal with 
   Williams. Garner's way of &quot;dealing&quot; with Williams is to try 
   to run him over with his car (!), but Williams eludes him and Garner 
   chases him down the dirt roads of Port Au Prince until he gets to a 
   busy marketplace, forcing him to get out of the car and chase 
   Williams on foot, but Williams is too fast and gets away. Fred and 
   Grace are at another busy marketplace, when Fred disappears. Williams 
   suddenly appears (he has a nasty knack for doing that!) and Grace 
   tells him that Fred has been acting strange lately, so Williams goes 
   looking for him with no luck. Grace wants Williams to take her back 
   to her hotel, but he has to make one stop first, a slaughterhouse, 
   where he has to inspect the meat to certify it is safe to eat 
   (Williams is a man of many talents). He leaves Grace alone to do his 
   inspection, while a worker gives her a tour of the slaughterhouse, 
   where she sees live steer being slaughtered (suddenly the voodoo 
   sacrifice doesn't seem inhumane after all!). Grace watches the slabs 
   of meat passing her by on hooks when she sees the dead body of 
   Murdock hanging on one of the meat hooks and screams. When Mr. Pratt 
   is talking to the Inspector at the police station, we learn that 
   Murdock was strangled before he was hung on the hook. Mr. Pratt 
   orders the Inspector to find out who killed his beloved 
   'secretary&quot; (Wait a minute. I thought Murdock was his 
   &quot;assistant&quot;?). The Inspector tells Mr. Pratt that he knows 
   Murdock was his bodyguard, not his secretary, telling him to watch 
   his step while he's in this country, otherwise he will be arrested. 
   When Mr. Pratt is in his hotel room packing, the black-gloved sneaks 
   into his room and strangles him with a garrote.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Robin (Kathryn Witt; <B><A HREF="cirio_h_santiago_film_reviews.htm#DemonOfParadise">THE
    DEMON OF PARADISE</A></B> - 1987), the girl behind the front desk of 
   the hotel, walks into the office of her boss, Mr. Philips, and 
   overhears a conversation he is having with the Inspector over the 
   phone. The Inspector wants Philips to do a private investigation of 
   the guests at his hotel and Philips refuses, telling the Inspector he 
   owns a lot of businesses on this island and investigating his guests 
   or employees is bad for business, so he tells it inspector no, he 
   won't do it. We then discover that Robin is having an affair with Mr. 
   Philips. She is also sleeping with the Inspector!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Grace is in her room about to take a shower (full-frontal nudity 
   alert!) when a bellboy delivers her a bouquet of flowers. She smells 
   the flowers, not knowing that they have been laced with a 
   hallucinogen. Williams catches Fred rummaging through his office and 
   floors him with a punch to the face. Fred tells him he has a 
   proposition, but Williams says no deal, telling him to get the hell 
   out of the country, he's already in serious trouble. When Fred 
   leaves, Williams gets a phone call from Grace, telling him to come to 
   her room immediately. Grace is on an acid trip and what happens next 
   is the definition of &quot;trippy&quot;. She sees a bunch of spiders 
   crawling on her bed and then she's in a never-ending red corridor, 
   where naked Haitian men are motioning for her (I've never seen so 
   many &quot;franks 'n beans&quot; in an Italian genre film. Even 
   Gabriele Tinti has a full-frontal scene! This sequence alone would 
   garner it an X or NC-17 Rating from the MPAA.) The scene ends with 
   her in the arms of the naked ice truck driver and they make love, 
   while Mr. Peacock (who is, thankfully, not naked) laughs at them. A 
   tripping Grace leaves her room and gets into her car, but Williams 
   stops her before she can drive away.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Garner accuses Peacock of pulling a double-cross and threatens his 
   life. Fred accuses Grace of screwing Williams. Grace accuses Fred of 
   only thinking about himself. As we can see, everyone's lives are 
   falling apart, but that's the least of their worries. At least they 
   have their lives...for now. There's still a killer on the loose. 
   Peacock gets a phone call from a man saying he is Crotz, who tells 
   him he wants to meet. Crotz tells him he has the formula and he will 
   give it to him for $70,000. Peacock agrees and goes to the arranged 
   meeting place with the money, but Crotz doesn't show up. The 
   black-gloved killer does and shoots a speargun bolt into Peacock's 
   chest and finishes him off by stepping on his head while he lies in a 
   mud puddle, drowning him in a few inches of water. But it's the next 
   murder you will never forget, just for its sheer brutality. Garner is 
   in a rum factory, when someone sprays him in the face with some 
   caustic substance, the skin on this face and hands melting and 
   falling to the ground. As Garner screams in pain, the killer throws 
   him on a conveyor belt, where he is dropped into an industrial sugar 
   cane grinder. As Garner tries to get out of the machine, the killer 
   uses a metal pipe to beat Garner's acid-scarred hands (It is almost 
   too brutal to watch!), before turning on the machine and grinding 
   Garner into a fine bloody mist.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Williams takes Grace to the rum factory for a tour and we find out 
   it is one of the many business that Mr. Philips owns. Grace and 
   William tour the factory on their own when something catches 
   Williams' eye.&nbsp; An old wood carving on one of the machines is 
   missing a piece (an eye), the same object he found on the dead body 
   in the restaurant. He puts the missing piece where it belongs and 
   someone tries to kill him by dropping a barrel of rum on him from the 
   second floor. Williams runs upstairs hoping to catch the person, but 
   he gets away. Then Williams does the unthinkable; he takes Grace back 
   to his place and makes love to her, not knowing that Fred is watching 
   them through a window. Remember the stuffed peacock that Mr. Peacock 
   gave to Williams? Well. Fred sees that Williams uses it as a secret 
   hiding place, watching as he places a small black journal into a 
   hidden drawer.&nbsp; Could it be that Williams had the formula the 
   entire time? I'm not going to tell you. You are going to have to 
   watch this film to get the answers to the many questions you now 
   have, but I won't be giving too much away by telling you that the 
   dead body Williams found in the restaurant was actually Crotz. Think 
   about that for a minute and read the review again. Think you know who 
   the killer is? All I will tell you is the name of the killer is in 
   this review, so good luck!</FONT></FONT><BR>

   the on-location Haiti photography. You can almost feel the sweltering

    your eyes will be glued to the screen in every scene he is in. Let's 
   not forget the lovely Anita Strindberg. She is a beautiful woman in 
   or out of her clothes, but she spends equal time doing both. This is 
   a highly sexual film, full of nudity and the male nudity surprisingly 
   takes up more screen time than the female nudity, something very 
   unusual for an Italian genre film, but it does give the film an 
   eerie, sexually-charged glow, especially the lone black man who 
   stares at Grace at the beginning and end of the film, book-casing 
   Grace's love of men of color. Even when she is tripping, her 
   hallucinations put her in the arms of black men. It is never 
   explained, but it really doesn't need an explanation. It's just 
   entertaining, erotic and highly watchable. Also helping the film is 
   Piero Umiliani's effective music score, full of heavy drumbeats 
   during the voodoo rituals and some orchestral tunes during the 
   killer's stalking and striking. He also supplied the scores to Lucio 
   Fulci's <B><A HREF="oh_those_most_secret_agents_1964.htm">OH! THOSE 
   MOST SECRET AGENTS!</A></B> (1964), as well as <B><A HREF="argoman_the_fantastic_superman_1967.htm">ARGOMAN

   during a voodoo wedding ceremony, where the bride and groom are tied 
   nude to the ground facing the dirt while people throw water on their 
   naked asses. When the killer interrupts the ceremony, the villagers 
   kill him in a way that can best be described as fiery. I had trouble 
   keeping up with the finale and had to watch it three time to make 
   sense of it, but people smarter than me should have no problem with 
   it. There are double and triple-crosses, a chase through a field of 
   harvested sugar cane and a few unexpected deaths, making this film a 
   delight for giallo and mystery fans alike. So what are you waiting 
   for? One other thing: It is never explained why anyone would want 
   this new drug, as it seems to kill anyone who uses it!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    VENGEANCE OF LADY MORGAN</A><A NAME="VengLadyMorgan1965"></A> (1965) -</B> 
   In Scotland, Lady Susan Blackhouse (Barbara Nelli; <B><A HREF="bloody_pit_of_horror_1965_foreign_ads.htm">BLOODY
    PIT OF HORROR</A></B> - 1965) is madly in love with architect Pierre 
   Brissac (Michel Forain), but he is not in the same social class as 
   Susan. She doesn't care and tells Pierre she loves only him, even 
   though Sir Harald Morgan (Paul Muller; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightmareCastle1965">NIGHTMARE
    CASTLE</A></B> - 1965) has loved her since childhood and expects to 
   take her hand in marriage. When Pierre gets a message that he is 
   needed in Paris, Susan tells him that she is going to tell her uncle, 
   Sir Neville Blackhouse (Carlo Kechler; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Ghost1963">THE
    GHOST</A></B> - 1963), that she loves only him and wants to marry 
   him. With Harald sitting between them, Susan tells her Uncle that 
   she's madly in love with Pierre and wants to be his wife,<A HREF="vengeance_of_lady_morgan_1965.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/lady morgan's vengeance italy poster6a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   apologizing to Harald, telling him she loves him like a sister loves 
   a brother (Ouch!). When Pierre takes a boat to Paris, someone sneaks 
   up behind him, knocks him out and tosses him overboard. Pierre is 
   reported missing and presumed dead, the police believing he 
   accidently fell overboard and drowned. Heartbroken, Susan agrees to 
   marry Sir Harald Morgan (She and Sir Neville are the only Blackhouses 
   alive and Sir Neville would like Susan to produce some children to 
   keep the bloodline alive), but only if she can leave with her Uncle 
   directly after the marriage ceremony to spend three months alone to 
   collect her thoughts and grieve internally, Susan promising Harald 
   that when she returns, she will be an obedient wife. Harald agrees 
   and they get married, Susan leaving with Sir Neville for three 
   months, not knowing that Pierre is actually alive in a hospital. He 
   was rescued by a passing boat, but the hit he took in the back of his 
   head caused him a severe case of amnesia, unable to even tell the 
   doctor his own name.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When the three months are up, Susan returns to Castle Blackhouse, 
   only to discover that Harald has dismissed all her longtime servants, 
   except for one, Terry (Edith MacGoven), and replaced them with scary 
   butler Roger (Gordon Mitchell; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#SkinUnderClaws1975">THE
    SKIN UNDER THE CLAWS</A></B> - 1975) and creepy housekeeper Lillian 
   (Erika Blanc; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#ThirdEye1966">THE THIRD EYE</A></B> 
   - 1966). It's apparent from the start that Harald, with the help of 
   Roger, Lillian and a reticent Terry, are trying to drive Susan insane 
   to inherit her fortune and take over the castle. Lillian hypnotizes 
   Susan at night when she goes to sleep, making her do and see things 
   that scare the crap out of her (such as placing a snake in Susan's 
   bed and then showing her it's nothing but a canopy bed cord). Roger 
   does his best to make Susan believe she is seeing things, such as 
   when he fakes pouring wine in her glass a dinner time and telling her 
   she drank it when she sees that her glass is empty (Good help is hard 
   to find!). After a few instances of making Susan display erratic 
   behavior, Harald has a Doctor (Luciano Catenacci; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#KillBabyKill1966">KILL,
    BABY...KILL!</A></B> - 1966) examine Susan, the Doctor telling 
   Harald he has no idea what is wrong with Susan. Harald tells the 
   Doctor that he was expecting a more &quot;precise&quot; diagnosis, 
   the Doctor saying to him, &quot;I'm a doctor, not a magician.&quot; 
   Harald apologizes, saying it's his wife's condition that makes him 
   forget his manners (Harald puts on a good show feigning that he cares 
   for Susan, I'll give him that). The Doctor says that Susan's symptoms 
   are very strange and contradictory. Susan's state is abnormal, her 
   mind is lost, her pupils dilated and she has an absent gaze. He 
   doesn't know what is wrong with her; he's never seen it before. He 
   tells Harald that Susan was hallucinating and hearing voices. She 
   thinks she is insane. Harald asks the Doctor if he thinks his wife is 
   insane and he says, &quot;As long as she is able to say she's insane, 
   she isn't.&quot; Harald then says, &quot;But could she be?&quot; and 
   the Doctor replies, &quot;Let's hope not.&quot; The Doctor says he 
   will return in a few days when Susan's symptoms will either have 
   worsened or disappeared. Harald asks if he can see Susan and the 
   Doctor says no, she's in a state of shock, but he's sure she will 
   recover soon enough. Harald says he will take his advice, but he 
   would like to be near her as much as possible (I bet he would!). As 
   the Doctor is walking out the castle's (very small) front door 
   (everyone has to duck their head when they walk through it!), he asks 
   Harald where Sir Neville Blackhouse is. When Harald asks why, the 
   Doctor says Susan wants to see him. Susan gave him a letter to give 
   to Sir Neville. When Harald asks to see the letter, the Doctor says 
   no, that will be unethical, but he'll make sure Sir Neville gets the letter.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That night, Susan looks out her bedroom window and sees Sir 
   Neville's carriage pulling up to the castle. Excited, Susan runs 
   outside in the pouring rain to greet him, but the carriage is no 
   longer there. Lillian pulls Susan inside and Harald tells her that 
   Sir Neville is not here, she's seeing things. When Roger walks in 
   from the pouring rain, Harald tells him to contact the Doctor, Susan 
   is now insane. While sitting alone in a room with Harald, Susan hears 
   a man's scream coming from outside, Harald nervously telling her it 
   is just the wind from an approaching storm. When Lillian puts Susan 
   to bed, Susan tells her that she was sure it was a man's scream, but 
   Lillian tells her Sir Harald was right, it was nothing but the wind. 
   We then discover that Lillian and Sir Harald are lovers and have been 
   for some time. Susan is awoken by the screams and sneaks outside, 
   following the screams past the castle's cemetery&nbsp; and into the 
   castle's dungeon, where Susan discovers Roger mercilessly whipping 
   Sir Neville, who is chained to a wall, Roger laughing like a maniac. 
   Sir Neville begs Roger, &quot;What have you done to my little 
   Susan?&quot;, Roger replying, &quot;Lady Susan is subject to our most 
   devoted attention!&quot; Sir Neville screams out, 
   &quot;Murderers!&quot; and Roger begins whipping and kicking him some 
   more. Susan passes out after witnessing the brutality and we then 
   watch Harald and Lillian in bed, Harald telling her that in a few 
   days, perhaps in a few hours, she will be one of the masters of this 
   castle. Roger then enters the room, surprised and angry to see 
   Lillian in bed with Harald. He tells Harald that Susan saw him 
   whipping Sir Neville and now she knows everything, but she fainted 
   and he carried her back to her bedroom. A furious Harald (Who says to 
   Roger, &quot;Since when do you enter a room without knocking?&quot;) 
   says he will take care of Susan, leaving the room, telling Roger to 
   &quot;take care&quot; of Sir Neville.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Susan wakes up, Harald is sitting on the bed, staring at her. 
   She tells him that she saw Roger whipping and hitting her Uncle, so 
   Harald tells her to take him where she saw it happen, but, of course, 
   Sir Neville is no longer there (We see Roger with his hand over Sir 
   Neville's mouth, hiding in another room in the dungeon). Harald takes 
   Susan back to her bedroom, where later that night, Lillian hypnotizes 
   her, just as the Doctor arrives, Harald telling him that his wife had 
   a relapse and she's getting worse every day. Lillian leads Susan to 
   the castle's roof, orders her to stand on a ledge and tells her she 
   can't move a muscle. Lillian then runs downstairs and tells the 
   Doctor that Susan is on the roof, threatening to jump. They all hurry 
   to the roof, where Harald yells out Susan's name, breaking the trance 
   and making Susan lose her balance, plummeting off the roof to her 
   death on the rock below. Susan's final word is &quot;Pierre&quot; and 
   Pierre actually hears her from his hospital bed, calling out Susan's 
   name. Like all good Gothic horror films, revenge is a dish best 
   served when you're a ghost hellbent on revenge to those who have 
   wronged you.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Susan calling out his name has made Pierre regain his memory, 
   telling his doctor his name and that he must go to Scotland because 
   Susan Blackhouse is probably worried about him. When Pierre arrives 
   at Castle Blackhouse, he finds it deserted and in a state of 
   disarray, sheets covering all the furniture. Suddenly, Susan appears 
   and tells Pierre that she was expecting him to come and that 
   &quot;coldness surrounded me&quot; waiting for his arrival. After 
   they make love, Susan tells Pierre she is dead, but he has a hard 
   time believing her, that is until she tells him the entire story 
   about how she got even with Harald's deadly treachery <B>(Cue the 
   long flashback!)</B>. Life is not so rosy for Harald, Lillian, Roger 
   or Terry, as they discover that Pierre is alive and could spoil their 
   plans. Harald turns out to be a lying prick, reneging on his deal to 
   make Roger a master of the castle. It turns out Roger and Lillian are 
   lovers and plan to kill Harald when the time is right. Harald doesn't 
   trust Terry, believing she will talk to police, so he threatens her, 
   saying if she doesn't keep her mouth shut, she will end up like Susan 
   (This comes right after Roger nearly rapes Terry!). Strange things 
   begin happening at the castle, like candles blowing out when all the 
   windows are closed and relighting by themselves, furniture moving on 
   its own, a vase exploding and acid being pit in Roger's bottle of 
   bourbon, forcing Roger to go off the deep end and stabbing Terry to 
   death when he thinks she is Susan's ghost. Susan also turns Harald 
   against Lillian, putting Roger's boots at the foot of her bed, so 
   Harald strangles Lillian with his bare hands. He and Roger bury 
   Lillian's body in the cemetery after Harald agrees to make Roger a 
   master of the castle, but they still don't trust each other. Harald 
   tries to poison Roger's drink, but Roger catches on and chases Harald 
   outside and inside the castle, where they meet on the castle roof, 
   Roger putting Harald in a spinning fireman's carry and tossing him 
   off the roof (even though it's not meant to be humorous, I must admit 
   that I laughed out loud when I saw an obvious dummy being thrown off 
   the roof). Immediately as Roger walks outside, Susan appears on a 
   horse and the horse stomps and kicks Roger in the head over and over 
   until his face is nothing but hamburger (if you freeze the film at a 
   certain frame, you can see Roger's right eye is hanging out of its 
   socket!). Now everyone in the castle is dead <B>(End of long flashback!)</B>.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Pierre still has a hard time believing Susan is a ghost until she 
   tells him to hug her and his arms go right through her. &quot;Do you 
   believe me now?&quot;, asks Susan, disappearing and re-appearing on 
   the bed, telling Pierre that he can touch her now. &quot;Kiss me, 
   kisse me for the last time&quot;, says Susan and Pierre does. Pierre 
   says he wants to be with Susan forever, but Susan says, &quot;Go, 
   Pierre, they're drinking blood. So you will be in danger. They appear 
   every night, human blood nourishes them. That's why they kept Uncle 
   Neville alive.&quot; Pierre realizes Sir Neville is still alive and 
   rushes to the dungeon to save him, ignoring Susan's objections. We 
   then see the ghosts of Harald, Lillian, Roger and Terry walking up to 
   a chained Sir Neville, who is close to death, each of them taking 
   turns sucking the blood out of his body. When Terry takes her turn 
   (she's last, of course), Sir Neville dies and Harald says it is over 
   for them, they have no more blood to drink. Pierre appears in the 
   dungeon and the four ghosts <A HREF="vengeance_of_lady_morgan_1965.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/lady morgan's vengeance germany film program2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="221" HEIGHT="306" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>realize
    that his body can give them the blood they need to survive, so they 
   try to subdue him by caving the roof of the dungeon in, but Susan 
   saves him. The evil ghosts don't give up, cornering Pierre in the 
   castle, but Susan cuts Pierre's hand and his blood drips on the 
   floor. The ghosts scurry to the floor and begin lapping it up! Susan 
   collects some of Pierre's blood in a champagne glass and offers it to 
   the ghostly foursome, but they fight over it and it spills on the 
   floor, where they once again lap it up like dogs! Susan tells Pierre 
   to go outside, he'll be safe there, but Terry appears at the front 
   door, begging for his blood. Pierre runs to the roof and the ghosts 
   follow, but Susan saves him once again and Pierre runs outside. Think 
   Pierre is safe? Think again, as the quartet of ghosts drop a chimney 
   on Pierre, killing him! Now Pierre can spend an eternity with Susan, 
   his one great love. Isn't love grand?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   (1986) -</B> Here it is, folks: the badfilm to end all badfilms! It's 
   got incoherent editing, terrible sound, grade school stop-motion 
   effects, a grating music score that gets under your skin like a staph 
   infection, amateur makeup and gore effects, a cast that couldn't act 
   their way out of a paper bag (including a lead actor whose moustache 
   changes from scene-to-scene) and, above all, a storyline that could 
   confuse a Mensa member, yet the film is such a train wreck, you would 
   have to be dead not to enjoy it (I can't speak for the dead, though. 
   Maybe they'd like it, too!). The film opens with Sergeant Bill 
   Whitman (Tim R. Morgan, the man of many moustaches) having a very 
   violent nightmare and then being called into a Ranger's station to 
   interview Ranger Sally Bradford (Lissa Breer), who was rescued in the 
   woods by a weird character named Dick Sargent (Bill McLeod, who looks 
   nothing like the late <B><A HREF="bewitched_tv_series.htm">BEWITCHED</A></B> 
   star). While Ranger Stillman (Mike Magri) and Dick trade homosexual 
   barbs, Bill questions Sally about the disappearance of Ranger Tello 
   (David Mica) at an abandoned hunting lodge deep in the woods. Sally 
   doesn't have much to say except, &quot;I don't like that place. It's 
   so quiet, it's...so dead!&quot;, so Bill asks Dick to take Stillman 
   to the abandoned lodge the following morning to look for clues into 
   Tello's disappearance. Before that happens (this is where the 
   disjointed editing comes into play), Bill and Sti<A HREF="winterbeast_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/winterbeast dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>llman
    (who is obsessed with nudie magazines and drinking beer) take a trip 
   to the Wild Goose Lodge, the area's only operational tourist lodge, 
   to talk to owner Dave Sheldon (a lisping Bob Harlow) to see if he 
   knows anything about Tello's whereabouts. Meanwhile, a wooden Indian 
   totem comes to (stop-motion) life and pulls a topless female extra 
   through the window of her home, tossing her (obvious rag doll) body 
   against the outside of the house, killing her (If you aren't laughing 
   out loud at this sequence, you have no sense of humor!). After Bill 
   questions Dave and comes up with nothing (somebody should have 
   questioned Bill about the wild fluctuation of the bushiness of his 
   moustache in this sequence) and Stillman manages to win the lodge's 
   toaster raffle (it's a fucking used toaster, for Christ's sake!), 
   Dick finally takes Stillman up the mountain to where he found Sally 
   (and to confuse the viewer even more, Bill and Sally suddenly appear 
   on the mountain with a fellow named Charlie Perkins [Charles Majka] 
   and Dick is nowhere to be seen!). They all spot a gruesome sight 
   where human skeletons are posed with Indian totems just like in 
   Bill's nightmares. Bill wants to shut down the Wild Goose Lodge until 
   all the murders and rumors of Indian legends are laid to rest, but 
   Dave refuses since this is prime tourist season. Or does he have a 
   more sinister reason? As more creatures begin killing hikers (and 
   Sally), Bill and Charlie (who is an expert on Indian legends) uncover 
   the truth and destroy the source of the Indian curse, or so they 
   think. In the finale, Stillman has his head bitten off by a dinosaur-like
    creature, Charlie is chased though town by a giant chicken creature 
   (complete with loud cackling sounds!) and Bill must face the 
   Winterbeast (Chris Lenge), an ancient Indian creature who likes to 
   strip humans of their flesh. I couldn't make this stuff up if I 
   tried!&nbsp; Not since <B><A HREF="#Equinox">EQUINOX</A></B> 
   (1967/1970) have I been so enthralled by what is basically a film 
   made with no money and pure imagination. Like <B>EQUINOX</B>, this 
   film is filled with stop-motion creatures but, unlike <B>EQUINOX</B>, 
   the creatures here elicit laughter rather than awe (not necessarily a 
   bad thing). I'm sure that's not what one-and-only-time 
   director/screenwriter Christopher Thies and producer/editor Mark 
   Frizzell were aiming for, but, by golly, this is one of the funniest, 
   most incoherent films I have witnessed in quite some time. <B><A HREF="winterbeast_1986b.htm">WINTERBEAST</A></B> 
   is entertaining as hell and the humor, whether intentional or not 
   (for an example of the former, pay close attention as Charlie stands 
   next to a statue of a cigar store Indian), drives the film to 
   delirious heights that you will not see anywhere else. Just as it 
   takes special talent to make a classic film, it also take that same 
   kind of talent (only on another plane of existence) to make a film 
   like this, where all of it's deficiencies add-up to pure 
   entertainment. I guarantee you will never see stop-motion creatures 
   as unusual and cheap as you'll see here, whether it's living totem 
   poles, a furry creature that bursts out of the ground and drags away 
   two female hikers or (my favorite) a four-armed drooling creature 
   that attacks a guy rappelling down a cliff and rips off his head. The 
   only non-stop-motion creature is the Winterbeast itself and it's a 
   rather creative and effective full-body make-up job. But, by far, my 
   favorite creature is Bob Harlow as the dastardly Dave Sheldon, whose 
   lisp makes him seem gayer than Paul Lynde going as Rock Hudson's date 
   to a Liberace concert. When he dons a 20's-style harlequin mask, 
   lip-synchs to some old tune on a 78 rpm record and begins fondling 
   human corpses he keeps in a secret room at his lodge, it's the film's 
   creepiest moment and worth the price of admission alone. So what are 
   you waiting for? This film can be purchased on DVD for a mere $7.99 
   directly from the filmmakers at <A HREF="http://www.winterbeast.com">www.winterbeast.com</A>.
    It's full of special features, including deleted scenes and outtakes 
   and is worth every penny. I can't recommend this enough. Also 
   starring Dori May Kelly as Barbara, Charlie's girlfriend/assistant. 
   Originally filmed in 1986, but not released on home video until 1992

   as the crazy &quot;Hank Kimball&quot; on the <B><A HREF="green_acres_tv_series_1965-1971.htm">GREEN

    to investigate a series of murders of women who were strung up 
   upside down from trees with their throats slit and all the blood 
   drained from their bodies. One of the group, Tasha (Thordis Brandt), 
   is a &quot;sensitive&quot; whose grandmother was a witch and quickly 
   catches the eye of Luther the Berserk (John Lodge, who left acting 
   shortly after this film to become Governor of Connecticut!), a 
   Warlock who has been committing the murders to keep his love Jessie 
   (Warrene Ott), a witch, young forever. Luther wants to bring Tasha in 
   as the 13th member of his coven and begins knocking off the rest of 
   Dr. Hayes' team sometimes using Tasha as his instrument of death. A 
   lone reporter on the trip, Vic (the prolific Anthony Eisley of <B><A HREF="mighty_gorga_1969.htm">THE
    MIGHTY GORGA</A></B> - 1969; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Tormentors">THE TORMENTERS</A></B> 
   - 1971 and many other genre films) begins to unravel the mystery with 
   Dr. Hayes as they begin to find the members of their party hanging 
   upside down drained of all their blood. Dr. Hayes puts Tasha under 
   hypnosis and finds out the truth: Tasha will take part in a Blood 
   Sabbath tomorrow and become the 13th member of Luther's coven. Luther 
   attacks the cabin and uses the body of one of the dead researchers, 
   Owen (Tony Benson), to attack the group. Vic and Dr. Hayes decide to 
   find Luther and Jessie and shoot them both in the head. They come up 
   with a plan to defeat the coven (which includes becoming invisible 
   wearing a necklace of wild garlic!), using the remaining female 
   researcher (Robyn Millan) as bait. They manage to subdue Luther and 
   tie him up as Vic (who is wearing the garlic neclace) invades the 
   coven and replaces the human blood for the sacrifice with pig's 
   blood. Luther breaks free of his bonds and knocks out Dr. Hayes and 
   the girl and tries to race back to the coven to stop them from 
   drinking the pig's blood. Alas, Luther is too late and his entire

   killed. Tasha becomes herself again and Luther chases her and Vic 
   through the swamps, where Vic puts the garlic necklace on Luther and 
   pushes him into quicksand. Vic meets the same fate as Tasha knocks 
   him into the quicksand. I guess she didn't become herself again after 
   all. Director William O. Brown (whose only other known film is <B><A HREF="one_way_wahini.htm">ONE
    WAY WAHINI</A></B> [1965], also starring Eisley) has crafted an 
   atmospheric chiller with good visuals (filmed in Marksville, 
   Louisiana), especially the shot of Brandt running through the woods 
   in slow motion holding her bare breasts in her hands. Rumors abound 
   that this film was shot with much nudity, but that's simply not true. 
   Even though this film was rated &quot;<B>M</B>&quot; when originally 
   released, <B><A HREF="witchmaker_1969b.htm">THE WITCHMAKER</A> </B>is 
   practical when showing nudity, using branches and other objects to 
   cover breasts and showing nudity from the back instead of the front.

   amazing that all the films we remember seeing time after time on TV

   - 1971) and Police Inspector Bouffet (Andrea Montuschi; <B><A HREF="merciless_man_1976.htm">THE

    as if someone or something wants to get to her. Dr. Meyer grabs 
   Gabriella and says, &quot;It's time, Gabriella. C'mon sweetheart, 
   it's all up to us now!&quot; and begins running down to the basement, 
   Gabriella in his arms kicking and screaming. Inspector Bouffant says. 
   &quot;If you think it's wise, we could hold off on this thing!&quot;, 
   trying to hand Dr. Meyer a pistol, but Meyer refuses, telling him a 
   flashlight would be more handy. As he carries a screaming Gabrielle 
   down to the basement, we see the stairs shake and rattle, while we 
   hear very heavy breathing on the soundtrack. &quot;Show me where your 
   hiding place is&quot;, says Dr. Meyer to the young girl, &quot;Where 
   are you? You're in here, aren't you?&quot; Gabriella falls to the 
   dirt floor, digging with her bare hands and Dr. Meyer becomes 
   excited, asking, &quot;Is this where you are? Is this where you are 
   hiding?&quot;, Gabriella shaking her head yes. &quot;We found him! 
   C'mon down here!&quot; screams Dr. Meyer, running upstairs and 
   leaving Gabriella alone in the basement, only she is not alone at 
   all, as we hear her let out an ear-piercing scream. We then see an 
   ambulance taking Gabrielle to a hospital, her right leg horribly 
   mangled. The Inspector's men begin digging at the spot Gabriella 
   pointed out and they find a wooden crate containing a skeleton. They 
   are able to identify the skeleton as that of Paolo Zeder, thanks to a 
   wallet found in the crate. Dr. Meyer yells out, &quot;We found Paolo 
   Zeder! He stumbled across a K Zone!&quot; What is very unusual is 
   that as soon as Dr. Meyer opens the sealed crate, he finds a slipper 
   belonging to Gabriella inside, the slipper to her mangled right foot. 
   How could it be in there when they just dug it up? That question, and 
   many others, will be answered in this extremely atmospheric and 
   frightening tale about immortality and the consequences that go along 
   with it.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We are then in Bologna, Italy in 1983. Budding author Stefano 
   (Gabriele Lavia; <B><A HREF="#Inferno1980">INFERNO</A></B> - 1980) 
   and his wife Alessandra (Anne Canovas) are celebrating their one-year 
   wedding anniversary. Stefano bought his wife a nice bracelet and she 
   purchased a used electric typewriter for him at a pawnshop.&nbsp; He 
   is so delighted with the gift, that after making love to his wife, he 
   runs out of the bedroom to try it out (Alessandra tells him that the 
   only thing wrong with the typewriter is that it was missing the 
   electric cord, so she had an electrician make a new one). While 
   Stefano is trying out his new toy, the used ribbon comes loose and he 
   becomes extremely interested in what the previous owner wrote, 
   staying up all night transcribing it. What he discovers will haunt 
   him for the rest of his life, if he has that long to live, that is. 
   He goes to his university teacher, Professor Chesi (John Stacy; <B><A HREF="yeti_1977.htm">YETI,
    GIANT OF THE 20TH CENTURY</A></B> - 1977), to try and make sense of 
   it, but by the look on the Professor's face, it's obvious he thinks 
   no good will come from it. He reads from the paper Stefano hands him: 
   &quot;The barriers of death shall at last be destroyed thanks to our 
   work and my return to life will signal the return of all. The place I 
   have discovered is the place the hierophant (i.e. <I>any interpreter 
   of sacred mysteries or esoteric principles</I>) was looking for.&quot;
    The Professor wants to know where he discovered his, because only a 
   scholar, an expert on religious history, can explain what it means. 
   He wants to know from whom precisely he got this from. Stefano shows 
   him the ribbon from the typewriter and the Professor tells him to 
   look on the ribbon for any mention of &quot;K Zones&quot;. Stefano 
   unspools the ribbon and finds this: &quot;Found a K Zone completely 
   free and above suspicion. Ideal place...&quot;, but before Stefano 
   can finish, the Professor says an old colleague of his, Dr. Meyer, 
   wrote a thesis on K Zones, so he pulls out some binders and looks for 
   the thesis, but it is missing. He tells Stefano that the idea of K 
   Zones came from a man named Paolo Zeder, who one day just up and 
   disappeared. &quot;He sustained that all the places of antiquity 
   where contact was made with the beyond, places like Delphi, Epheris 
   and Dordunne all contained common properties, which he called 
   alchemical, but what we call geological similarities. Now these 
   sites, which he called K Zones, were supposed to be different, that 
   is they defied all natural laws and they existed in a state of 
   suspension, on time, on season, on growth and on death. 
   Idealistically zero time and it will allow a return from the dead and 
   beyond.&quot; (In layman's terms, K Zones are pet semataries).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Stefano begins his search for the name of the man who previously 
   owned the typewriter, asking his policeman friend, Guido (Alessandro 
   Partextano; <B><A HREF="sword_of_the_barbarians_1982.htm">SWORD OF 
   THE BARBARIANS</A></B> - 1982), if he could get the owner's name from 
   the pawnshop, which he does. The name of the man is a priest, Don 
   Luigi Costa, so he goes to his church to question him. Don Luigi 
   (Ferdinando Orlandi; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Macabre1980">MACABRE</A></B> 
   - 1980) chews out Stefano, telling him he never owned a typewriter 
   (even though there's an empty typewriter stand in his office) and to 
   never come back to this church again, so Stefano leaves. After taking 
   a swim at a health spa with Guido, Stefano notices that the 
   typewriter ribbon and the letters he created from them are missing 
   from his locker, so he goes back to the church, thinking that he left 
   them there.&nbsp; He discovers from another priest that Don Luigi 
   hasn't been a member of this church for years. The man who told 
   Stefano he was Don Luigi was a fake, an imposter. Priest Don Mario 
   (Aldo Sassi) tells Stefano Don Luigi's sordid history. He was a 
   wonderful priest who took children to camp every summer, but then he 
   started losing his faith in God and deserted the church. He tells 
   Stefano that Don Luigi has a sister, Anna, in Remini, so Stefano and 
   Alessandra drive there. While Alessandra suns herself on the beach 
   (she has no interest in her husband's quest for the truth), Stefano 
   goes to Anna's (Maria Teresa Tofano; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#NightEvelynGrave71">THE
    NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE</A></B> - 1971) address and 
   discovers she is blind as a bat and renting a room in the house, so 
   Stefano makes up a lie and tells Anna that he was good friends with 
   Don Luigi and she lets him see the room, which was Don Luigi's. In 
   the room, Stefano discovers a badge that his wife gave to Guido, so 
   he calls his friend, only to discover that he has been transferred. 
   Both Stefano and Alessandra find that strange, since Guido never told 
   them that he was being transferred (And how did the badge get in the room?).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As Stefano and Alessandra are about to leave Remini, Stefano sees 
   the fake Don Luigi putting Anna in a car, so they follow it, ending 
   up in a cemetery, where the fake priest takes Anna every week to pay 
   respect to her brother's grave, only she doesn't know it isn't her 
   brother's grave at all, but some stranger's grave! Stefano learns 
   that the real Don Luigi died in a Remini hospital and talks to Dr. 
   Melis (Marcello Tusco; <B><A HREF="django_shoots_first_1966.htm">DJANGO
    SHOOTS FIRST</A></B> - 1966), an old family friend of Alessandra. He 
   tells them that when Don Luigi died, he didn't want to be buried in 
   Remini and gives them the address of the crypt where he was laid to 
   rest. Stefano discovers that Don Luigi's crypt is empty. We then 
   discover that Dr. Melis is working for Mr. Big (Bob Tonelli; <B><A HREF="balsamus_man_of_satan_1970.htm">BALSALMUS,
    MAN OF SATAN</A></B> - 1970), a rich businessman who is financing 
   experiments pertaining to K Zones, where an elderly Dr. Meyer and an 
   adult Gabrielle (Paula Tanziani) are performing experiments on Don 
   Luigi's dead body to see if he comes back to life. They have buried 
   Don Luigi in a K Zone, the same location where Gabriella nearly lost 
   her leg as a child (she now walks with a limp), a &quot;holiday 
   summer camp&quot; for children, which has been long deserted. Stefano 
   makes his way to that location, too, and what he discovers may end up 
   costing him and his wife their lives.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   treasure and is still making films up to this day. He takes his time 
   showing us how K Zones work, but once he does, showing us a toothless 
   Don Luigi rising from the dead and slowly chasing Stefano while 
   laughing creepily, it's an image you will not soon forget. I've been 
   reading reviews of this film where people accuse Stephen King of 
   ripping off this film for his book <B><A HREF="pet_sematary_1989.htm">PET
    SEMATARY</A></B> (made into a film in 1989), but that is just being 
   ignorant, as the plot of this film is hardly original, but Avati does 
   put a nice atmospheric spin on it to get your mind off the fact that 
   the story has its roots in ancient folklore, yet he makes it seem 
   totally original. While lacking any nudity and very little blood or 
   graphic violence, this film doesn't need it, because it is not that 
   kind of film. When the violence does come, it is totally shocking and 
   surprising (especially a close-up of young Gabriella's mangled leg). 
   I wish someone would have told me this when I first went to a movie 
   theater to see this film in 1984. Motion Picture Marketing (MPM) 
   released this film to theaters under the title <B><A HREF="zeder_revenge_of_the_dead_1983.htm#USPoster">REVENGE
    OF THE DEAD</A></B> (they also released it under the review title), 
   using a phony advertising campaign that made you believe you were 
   going to see a film in the vein of Lucio Fulci's <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Zombie">ZOMBIE</A></B> 
   (1979), even releasing it Unrated, bypassing the MPAA! When I was 
   watching it onscreen, many people walked out of the theater 
   disgusted, feeling deceived and rightfully so, thinking they were 
   going to see a gore film and getting something completely different. 
   Even though I was angry for being fooled, the film won me over. I 
   have seen the film many times since then and it keeps getting better 
   on each viewing, as I pick up things that I didn't notice before. 
   This is a film that demands 100% of your time when watching it, as it 
   is cerebral as well as entertaining. If you can't give this film your 
   full attention, I recommend you not watch it until you can. I love 
   films that play with your perceptions of love and death and this film 
   fits the bill nicely.&nbsp; I'm going to review some of Pupi Avati's 
   films in the near future, but most of them are harder to find than 
   tits on a rock, although I did find a couple of them (Thanks, <A HREF="http://www.roguevideodvd.com">Rogue
