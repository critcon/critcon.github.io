   psychosexual thriller about a woman-hating office worker named Bob 
   Bellings (Anton Rothschild) who becomes a rapist/murderer. When we 
   first meet Bob, he's following a woman home from the grocery store. 
   He forces his way into her apartment, rapes her and beats her over 
   the head with a heavy glass ashtray, killing her. We next see him at 
   his job (where he seems to be the only man in an office <A HREF="breaking_point_1975.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/breaking point 1975 swedish poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="246" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>full
    of women), stamping paperwork, calling his co-workers 
   &quot;bitches&quot; under his breath and watching a newscast of his 
   crime, where a psychiatrist named Sigmund tells the viewing audience 
   that 87% of women want to be raped and maybe this latest victim 
   wouldn't have been killed if she just let the rape happen and didn't 
   fight back. It becomes apparent after a short while that we are 
   seeing the world through the balding and mousey-looking Bob's eyes 
   and not everything we see and hear may be the truth. A beautiful 
   female co-worker comes on to Bob, so he takes a long lunch hour and 
   follows her home, where she gives him a blowjob (yes, this film is 
   full of hardcore sex scenes), he ejaculates on her face and, after 
   she pleases him some more, he gets dressed and returns to his boring 
   job (When he returns, he hears a story on the TV news that everyone 
   will be issued a permit to carry guns!). Yes, Bob is a schizophenic 
   (he listens to tapes on the subject in his car), and the only time he 
   seems happy is when he is playing with his model trains or reading 
   train magazines. It seems to get him sexually excited and one time, 
   when reading a train magazine, he fantasizes about getting a blowjob 
   from a beautiful woman and a fly lands on the tip of his erect penis. 
   He goes to flick it off and hits his dick instead, making him scream 
   out in pain. Bob rents a car and travels the streets looking for his 
   next victim. He finds a woman, follows her home, forces her to strip 
   and has sex with her. While he is raping her from behind, she picks 
   up a pair of scissors and stabs him in the leg. She escapes in her 
   car, but Bob chases her and she dies in a fiery auto accident when 
   her car slams into a house and explodes. The next time we see Bob, he 
   is giving a cup of coffee to one of his female co-workers that is 
   full of his sperm (&quot;I'll teach that bitch!&quot;). He then goes 
   to a gun dealer, where he purchases a pistol and &quot;fragmentation 
   ammo&quot; (they explode on contact) and then goes to a schoolyard to 
   watch the children play. He picks up a young girl from the playground 
   and drives her to a secluded section of the snowy forest, where he 
   feeds her candy. Thankfully, nothing happens (I was nervous as hell 
   that something would) and he drives her home (She asks him, 
   &quot;Shall we meet again?&quot; and he sternly says, 
   &quot;No!&quot;). After another episode where Bob picks up a hooker 
   and they fuck in his rental car, the film takes a strange turn. While 
   Bob is walking down the street<A HREF="breaking_point_1975b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/breaking point 1975 swedish vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="138" HEIGHT="194" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>,
    he is taken hostage by some bank robbers and driven to a secluded 
   section of the forest. DO NOT READ THE FOLLOWING IF YOU DO NOT WANT 
   TO KNOW THE FINALE! Bob gets the drop on the bank robbers and kills 
   them all with his pistol and fragmentation ammo. When a police 
   helicopter overhead mistakens him for one of the bank robbers, Bob 
   grabs a machine gun and shoots the helicopter out of the sky. He 
   hijacks a car off the highway and drives to the airport, where he 
   picks up his wife and young daughter, who were away on vacation. When 
   his wife asks him how things have been, he replies, &quot;You know 
   nothing ever happens in this shit town!&quot; END OF SPOILER.&nbsp; 
   Since this is a well-made film, I was taken by surprise when the 
   first hardcore sex scene appeared. Director Bo Arne Vibenius used 
   hardcore shots for his previous film <B><A HREF="thriller_a_cruel_picture_1974c.htm">THRILLER</A></B>,
    but <B><A HREF="breaking_point_1975b.htm">BREAKING POINT</A></B> is 
   much more pornographic and misogynistic in it's approach to sex (if 
   that's possible to imagine). All the sex depicted here is how Bob 
   thinks it should be: For the man's pleasure only. It's mostly 
   blowjobs and doggy- style, with some titty-fucking and a scene of a 
   girl pleasuring herself with the gearshift of Bob's rented car (When 
   he returns the car to the rental office, the gearshift knob is 
   missing!). Truth be told, I liked this film better than <B>THRILLER</B> 
   because it's use of sex and violence as a metaphor is much more 
   pronounced and profound. There's a scene where Bob is walking through 
   a park one night and he witnesses a mugging and walks right past the 
   victim's body, only to be mugged himself immediately afterward. It 
   seems that Bob is mugged often, because he keeps money hidden 
   underneath his watchband. He simply gives it to the knife-wielding 
   mugger and they both move on as if nothing happened. The surprise 
   ending is a shocker and a perfect way to end the film. I can honestly 
   say I did not see it coming. Director Vibenius (who uses the 
   pseudonym &quot;Ron Silberman Jr.&quot; for his directorial and 
   scripting credits and &quot;Stan Kowalski&quot; [an inside joke] for 
   the producer credit) never directed another film after this, which is 
   a shame because <B>BREAKING POINT</B> (not to be confused with the <A HREF="breaking_point_1976.htm">1976
    thriller starring Bo Svenson</A> or the <A HREF="breaking_point_1993.htm">1993

   psychosexual thriller. Also starring Irena Billing, Jane McIntosh, 
   Susanne Audrian, Bertha Klingspor, Adolf Deutchand and Joachim

   boring and unexciting. When a girl (Deborah Whitney) turns 21, her 
   lawyer tells her that she has inherited her dead parents&#146; home, 
   which is run by her aunt (Tara Blair), a centuries-old witch who 
   worships Satan. She travels to her home, has 
   hardcore&nbsp;sex&nbsp;with&nbsp;faceless devil worshippers, finds 
   out that she has a twin sister who is mad and then is sacrificed to 
   Satan. Her boyfriend and, then, her professor travel to her home to 
   find out why she has not contacted anyone for several weeks. They are 
   both sucked and fucked and then sacrificed to Satan. It all turns out 
   that this was the aunt&#146;s plan to replace the good sister with 
   the bad one so she can lure unsuspecting suitors to the house for 
   sacrifice to the Master. Besides a few atmospheric scenes, this 
   hardcore sex/horror film has little to offer. It was shot silent with 
   bad dubbing added later that does not match the actors&#146; lip 
   movements. The sex scenes are boring and there are too many scenes of 
   big dicks entering tight assholes. This film can only be recommended 
   for porno/horror completists and anal sex deviates. Also starring

    location photography, sets and costumes, good-to-great acting by a 
   cadre of porno vets and sex scenes that are sure to please the 
   raincoat crowd.&nbsp; When Count Dracula (the late Jamie Gillis, who 
   has never been better and starred in the similarly-themed <B><A HREF="dracula_sucks_1978.htm">DRACULA
    SUCKS</A></B> the previous year) falls in love with local girl Surka 
   (Samantha Fox), everything seems fine and dandy. When his family 
   forbids him to marry her because of his social standing, he becomes 
   very depressed and while at a party/orgy (with an obligatory cameo by 
   Ron Jeremy as a party guest who gets a blowjob while juggling three 
   apples!) gets drunk and rapes Surka. She commits suicide and Dracula 
   curses himself to never be accepted by God or the Devil, therefore 
   turning himself into a vampire (a novel concept on the vampire 
   mythology). Cut to 1980 and Castle Dracula is turned into a tourist 
   attraction. Dracula spots a tourist named Sally (Fox again) who is 
   the spitting image of his long-lost Surka. What Dracula doesn't know 
   is that Sally is an undercover agent for the F.I.B. (no, I spelled it 
   right). Dracula gets a visa to travel to America where he hopes to 
   get Sally to fall in love with him. The Americans think he is a 
   Russian agent and assign Sally to keep her eye on him. While on the 
   ship to America, Dracula spots Vita Valdez (the incomparable Vanessa 
   Del Rio) making a drug deal with three thugs. After a four-way sex 
   scene, Dracula kills the thugs and puts the bite on Vita, asking her 
   as he sinks his teeth into her flesh: &quot;Can you type?&quot; When 
   she replies: &quot;Yes. Fifty words a minute.&quot;, Dracula bites 
   her in places that only you and I can dream of. Vita becomes 
   Dracula's secretary in the States while Sally keeps a close eye on 
   him. What Dracula doesn't realize is that his trusted sidekick 
   Renfrew (a hilarious Gordon G. Duvall) is a traitor and is reporting 
   all the Count's moves to the government. There's also a police 
   detective (Mark Dexter) who is trying to solve a series of murders 
   where the<A HREF="dracula_exotica_1980.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dracula exotica ad mat small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="263" HEIGHT="195" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   bodies of the victims are drained of blood. In the end, the good 
   Count does get Sally to love him and they both turn into doves (!), 
   flying into the sunset. Director Warren Evans, who has directed many 
   porno films using the names Shaun Costello, Helmuth Richler (using 
   this name to direct the nasty Vietnam rape/intruder film <B><A HREF="forced_entry_1972.htm">FORCED
    ENTRY</A> </B>- 1972) and many other pseudonyms, gives this film 
   more of a B-movie feel than porno as the sets are elaborate, the 
   camerawork above par for a bishop-slapper and the script (written 
   under another Evans' pseudonym &quot;Kenneth Schwartz&quot;) filled 
   with witty asides and situations not normally seen in X-Rated films. 
   Star Jamie Gillis was still making porno films and had dabbled in 
   legitimate films, including <B><A HREF="nighthawks_1981.htm">NIGHTHAWKS</A></B> 
   (1981) and Joel M. Reed's <B><A HREF="night_of_the_zombies_2_1981.htm">NIGHT

   (1981) up until his death in 2010. Based on his performance here, he 
   should have gotten more mainstream roles, but the studio system looks 
   down on this unless you're a good-looking girl like Traci Lords 
   (although Vanessa Del Rio did play herself on <B><A HREF="nypd_blue_tv_series_1993-2005.htm">NYPD
    BLUE</A></B> in 1996 and it was hilarious). Also starring Eric 
   Edwards as &quot;Big Bird&quot;, the head agent for the F.I.B. who 
   makes Fox give him a blowjob in a porno theater, Herschell Savage as 
   a morgue attendant who has his way with Del Rio's corpse before she 
   comes back to life to give him a surprise and the late Bobby Astyr as 
   a foreign diplomat who gets a German Luger enema. It also features a 
   bunch of other X-Rated stars in various small roles, including Randy 
   West, Marlene Willoughby, Dave Ruby and Tony Mansfield. To all those 
   out there afraid to rent a porno film: <B><A HREF="dracula_exotica_1980b.htm">DRACULA

   is to pick up a man at a bar, take him to a motel room, then stab him 
   to death just before he is about to finish the dirty deed. You see, 
   Sarah is a traveling preacher dedicated to the cause that sex for 
   pleasure is a sin punishable by death. On her travels she befriends a 
   lesbian (Sandra Henderson) who is willing to help Sarah lure men to 
   her apartment. Sarah even goes as far as killing her lesbian friend's 
   lover to be sure that she has no illicit sex. This wild film borders 
   on the pornographic and is definitely not for anyone who is easily 
   offended or religious. (Producer Bob Chinn has produced and/or 
   directed many X-Rated sex films in the 70's and 80's) The hair styles 
   and clothing of the early 70's will evoke laughter as will the 
   extremely bad acting and dialog. Cheap gore effects, religious 
   symbolism (in the shape of a hippy with a guitar, played by perennial 
   porn star John Holmes), and a preoccupation with oral sex fill out 
   the bill and make this a once in a lifetime experience. Director Walt

   oral sex, but no shots of intercourse or &quot;money shots&quot;, 
   except from puppets with huge dicks, which this film is obsessed 
   with). Director Robert J. Kaplan (<B><A HREF="scarecrow_in_a_garden_of_cucumbers_1971.htm">SCARECROW
    IN A GARDEN OF CUCUMBERS</A></B> - 1971), who co-wrote the 
   screenplay with Paul &amp; Sam Cohen, seems to think that putting a 
   bunch of rubber chickens in the water and calling it &quot;The Famous 
   Chicken Of The Sea&quot; or giving the Caucasian Mayor White a huge 
   black dick is what constitutes funny, but whenever Brother Theodore 
   is on screen, the film shines, because director Kaplan had the common 
   sense to let Theodore do his own thing, which, if you ever watched 
   David Letterman's show during his NBC years, you know you are in for 
   a bizarre treat (One scripted line has him saying, &quot;That's not 
   fish you smell, that's pussy!&quot;, which still had me rolling on 
   the floor. The man is a master of timing.). Besides a preoccupation 
   with bizarre puppets, oral sex and weird set designs (check out the 
   interior of Captain Clitoris' house and boat), the film also features 
   two talking homosexual fucking dogs, a naked woman riding a miniature 
   Shetland pony while a bunch of guys jerk-off in a stable and a 
   miniature submarine shaped like a penis. There's also some decent 
   underwater photography, more location photography than usual for a 
   porn film and a music score that sounds too much like John Williams' 
   score for <B>JAWS</B> to be a coincidence. I'm surprised Spielberg 
   &amp; Co. never sued to stop this film from being released, but 
   Brother Theodore did star in the Spielberg-produced <B><A HREF="burbs_1989.htm">THE
    'BURBS</A></B> in 1989, so I guess there were no hard feelings. <B>GUMS</B>

   around for the puppet music video (a bastardized version of &quot;Mack
    The Knife&quot;) that plays over the closing credits. Beware of the

    Maya (Linda Christian) to be part of their next ritual. Maya's role 
   in the ritual is unclear, but one thing is certain: it has something 
   to do with sex and blood. Maya begins having nightmares and it seems 
   the only way she feels better is to have late night sex with her 
   husband George (Paul Barry). Maya starts going through a personality 
   change and begins seeing things, including a painting on the wall 
   that bleeds from the eyes and being attacked by a woman with a 
   rotting face. Maya and George are invited to a costume party at Dr. 
   Muldavo's mansion where they both drink drugged wine. George passes 
   out and Maya joins the party where all the guests are cutting each 
   other and drinking the blood. Dr. Muldavo then asks Maya to join the 
   coven and become his queen. At the ceremony, just before Maya is to 
   become queen, George bursts in with a glowing toy sword and burns Dr. 
   Muldavo's face with it (one of the worst makeup jobs of all time). 
   Maya doublecrosses George and he ends up dead. Maya takes over the 
   coven and tries to nurse Dr. Muldavo back to health with blood taken 
   from murdered coven members. She fails, he dies and Satan punishes 
   her for her failure.&nbsp; The first thing you'll notice about this 
   flick is the ear-splitting synth score by Arlon Obler. It drones on 
   incessantly and pounds on your brain until it turns to mush. That may 
   have been intentional, put there to get your mind off the 
   non-existant plot, porno film production values and minimal acting 
   talents of the cast. Some of the dialogue is risable, such as when 
   underling Arthur (James Proctor) disobeys Dr. Mulvado and the evil 
   doctor turns to him and says, &quot;You pitiful worm under my feet! 
   You dare thwart me?&quot; It's apparent after watching this film for 
   just a few minutes that this was a porn feature heavily edited to 
   achieve an R rating. At 68 minutes long, there are many jarring jump 
   cuts, some right in the middle of dialogue scenes, as not to show 
   hardcore sex going on in the background. It is never more obvious 
   than at the costume party, which is nothing more than a series of 
   severe edits, so severe that it makes the entire sequence incoherent. 
   It's also quite obvious that most of the bloodletting was also edited 
   out. Here's my question: What's the point? One wonders who would have 
   been an audience for this version of the film? It has no violence for 
   the horror crowd and no sex for the raincoat crowd. I have the 
   feeling that even the unedited version would satisfy no one. Like the

   daughter-in-law (played by porn perennial Serena) visciously raped, 
   the former member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff hires Vietnam vet Joe

   in warehouses, massage parlors, restaurants and deserted backroads 
   until, in the finale, Napoli goes one-on-one with Mandano in his 
   palatial mansion. I was quite surprised with this film. It contains 
   good acting, an intricate plot and, for once, the hardcore sex plays 
   an important part in the storyline. One scene shows Mandano 
   sentencing demented rapist Spike (who assaulted the General&#146;s 
   daughter-in-law) to a fate worse than death. If he can make love to a 
   woman without ejaculating, he lives and the woman dies. If he 
   squirts, he dies and she lives. Everything goes well for Spike (who 
   likes to slap women around) until the woman starts munching on his 
   baloney pony. Trying as hard as he can to keep control, he loses it, 
   cums and gets a bullet in the head. Even the Mob has their standards. 
   Spike was punished because he raped an innocent person. A 
   relationship develops between Napoli and the General&#146;s secretary 
   Louise (played by porn regular Sharon Kelly who uses the name 'Sara 
   Bloom' here). Napoli tells Louise his motivation for accepting the 
   General&#146;s plan to wipe out the Mob: When he was a child he saw 
   his Uncle Alfonso &quot;split in half on a railroad track&quot; by 
   the Mafia, so he has a score to settle of his own. Unfortunately, 
   when he does get to settle the score, someone else has a score to 
   settle with him. It is not a happy ending. Toss in multiple shootings 
   (in the crotch, in the head, etc), a pitchfork to the back and hot 
   sex scenes and you come up with a satisfying brew of graphic sex and 
   violence. As a matter of fact, this film could have worked without 
   the hardcore sex (softcore would have done it), but it wouldn&#146;t 
   have been as much fun. Director Norbert Meisel also made the non-porn

    abysmal porn flick that's only good for one reason: An early 
   appearance by George &quot;Buck&quot; Flower as the leader of a 
   satanic cult who disguises himself as a producer of a Hollywood film 
   production company called &quot;Satanic Films&quot; (not much of a 
   false identity if you ask me). The film begins with the cult leader, 
   Manheim Jarkoff (Flower, who is buck naked except for a cape), and 
   his two disciples performing a ritual over a tied-up Carla (it's 
   extremely choppy and looks as if all the hardcore footage was edited 
   out). At the end of the ceremony, the male disciple, Boris (Ron 
   Darby), pours oil over Carla's naked body and sets her on fire 
   (offscreen). They cover up her death by making it look like she died 
   in a fiery car crash (also offscreen). Carla's good friend Pamela 
   Goodright (Judy Angel) doesn't buy the car crash story (Carla didn't 
   know how to drive!), so she goes to ex-boyfriend Wayne's house to ask 
   him for help (They first have sex, where they suck on each other's 
   tongues, Pamela sucks on Wayne's index finger and they both have slow 
   motion scenes where their sweaty heads shake back-and-forth as they 
   reach climax). Pamela and Wayne go to the studio of Satanic Films, 
   where Jarkoff tells them that Carla was a hopeless drug addict. As 
   Pamela and Wayne leave the studio <A HREF="satans_lust_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/satan's lust-horny devils dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>unsatisfied
    with Jarkoff's explanation, Boris tries to contact &quot;The 
   Master&quot; to kill them both, but a cackling Jarkoff stops him and 
   says, &quot;I'm going to test the girl for her reaction! Heh, heh, 
   heh...!&quot; While Jarkoff's female disciple, Edith, keeps Wayne 
   busy (She first appears to him as a cat and then has sex with him 
   [offscreen]. He's so good that she falls in love with him!), Jarkoff 
   hypnotizes Pamela back at his studio, makes her strip and the fucks 
   her from behind (while he's fully clothed!), stopping midway to 
   lube-up one of his fingers and insert it up her ass (a jump-edit cuts 
   out all the ass action and resumes when he wipes off his finger with 
   a tissue!). Jarkoff and his two minions then perform a ceremony where 
   Satan appears (a guy in a cheap rubber Devil mask) and tells Edith 
   that she must be punished for falling in love with a mortal. She's 
   tied to the altar and Jarkoff whips her with a piece of rope with a 
   knot tied on the end. Boris then climbs through Pamela's bedroom 
   window, chloroforms her while she's sleeping (naked) and then rapes 
   her (He says, &quot;I remember! My little Katrina!&quot; 
   over-and-over and ends the rape by saying, &quot;My little eleven 
   year-old Katrina!&quot; as if to imply he's a pedophile), but Wayne 
   saves her before Boris can take her to The Master. When Edith goes to 
   warn Wayne what's going on (&quot;I'm a 300 year-old witch!&quot;), 
   Satan turns her into a skeleton while she's fucking Wayne (We see a 
   skeleton with a candle protruding out of it's snatch, which tells us 
   that Edith was having some one-on-one action with a candle while she 
   was on top of Wayne!). In the finale, Jarkoff and Boris die in a 
   fiery car crash (offscreen) while trying to outrun the police and 
   Pamela learns she is pregnant with Satan's baby. Now, I'd pay a 
   dollar to see that birth!&nbsp; This short (just shy of 51 minutes), 
   severely hacked-up film is just terrible. Even the usually reliable <A HREF="george buck flower.htm">George
    &quot;Buck&quot; Flower</A>, who has appeared in everything from 
   G-rated family films to X-rated porn (like this), fails to make this 
   film interesting and the cheap sets, terrible acting and bad library 
   music score (where we even hear a musak version of The Beatles' 
   &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;!) further drag this film down into 
   desperate mediocrity. While there is no hardcore footage on view (the 
   frequent jump cuts suggests they were all edited out), the softcore 
   footage that remains (including the late Flower's flaccid penis, an 
   image I'm still trying to purge from my memory) is explicit, but not 
   the least bit titillating. The unknown director (Does anyone know who 
   he is? There are credits in the beginning of the film, but they are 
   too small and blurry to make out) has the bad habit of focusing the 
   camera on inanimate objects, such as skulls, candles and the altar's 
   horned symbol, when he should have pointed it at the supposed action 
   that was going on. The problem is that nearly everything that could 
   have remotely been considered exciting happens offscreen and what is 
   onscreen (including sped-up photography of a van speeding down a 
   road, the cheap Devil mask and lots of softcore boning) is boring to 
   the point of inducing narcolepsy. This just proves that some 
   little-seen films from the 60's &amp; 70's are better left off that

    perverted flick delivers the goods nonetheless. Nick and Eva (Widow 
   Blue) agree to kill each other&#146;s spouses, take the insurance

   meat cleaver to the neck after he has gay sex with Eva&#146;s brother 
   Marshall. Nick and Eva then have sex on top of her dead husband (she 
   sucks her dead hubby&#146;s limp dick while fucking Nick!). They then 
   place Jerry&#146;s bloody body in a coffin and Marshall, Nick and Eva 
   have three-way sex on top of the casket. After more sex scenes

   Nick&#146;s wife. Under the ruse that they are having dinner at 
   Eva&#146;s house, Nick&#146;s wife arrives and the plan goes into

   and will be back in 30 minutes. Nick persuades his wife to make love

    The plot deals with a drug-sniffing homosexual killer (Zebedy Colt, 
   a true sicko of 70&#146;s hardcore who can really act. Or is it an 
   act?) who kills all the acquaintances of the helpless Ken (Harry 
   Reems) for reasons which will not be made clear till the end of the 
   film. The first victim on his slate is Ken&#146;s fiancee Faye (C.J. 
   Laing). Wearing a stocking over his head, he forces himself into her 
   apartment, <A HREF="sex_wish_1975c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sex wish.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="168" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ties
    her up with leather harnesses and rapes her graphically with a 
   vibrator, all the while talking like a little child who has done 
   something naughty (he does have quite a mother complex). After 
   jerking off on her, Colt (he is never given a name in this film) then 
   slits her throat with a rapier he has concealed in a cane. Ken 
   returns to the apartment and to his horror finds Faye dead, her body 
   a bloody mess. Ken remembers bumping into someone in the hallway 
   (Colt wears an overcoat, bowler hat and carries&nbsp; a briefcase and 
   that dangerous cane) and vows to hunt this man down and kill him. A 
   dropped matchbook in the hallway gives him his only clue. Ken may be 
   heartbroken, but he is also horny as hell and proceeds to screw all 
   the females in the cast. Colt then proceeds to dispatch them in in 
   brutal ways. The most brutal is when Colt forces a black couple to 
   have sex while he watches. He orders the man to do sexual acts to the 
   woman (still talking like a child) and then tells him to &quot;Bite 
   off her nippie&quot;. When he refuses, Colt stabs then castrates him 
   (offscreen, thankfully, although you do see the rapier next to his 
   dick). He then forces the girl to give him a blowjob. When she bites 
   his dick, Colt slits her throat. Ken, meanwhile, is getting closer to 
   discovering who this maniac is. He stakes out the streets of New York 
   and has a couple of close encounters with Colt, but he manages to 
   elude Ken. The dropped matchbook leads Ken to a gay bar called the 21 
   Club. Ken calls the police detective involved in the case and they 
   both stake out the club. They discover that Colt is playing piano for 
   a transvestite cabaret singer. A gunfight breaks out and the 
   detective is killed. Ken corners Colt and shoots him in the heart, 
   but not before Colt professes his love for Ken! Wow! Remember when 
   porno films had a plot? This one does and it&#146;s a pretty good 
   one. Not that </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">SEX

   is by any means a well made film. It looks like it was edited with a 
   butterknife and the frequent sex scenes are graphic but passionless 
   (maybe it was meant to be that way but I doubt it). But it is well 
   acted, something you do not find in today&#146;s hardcore films. I 
   guess audiences were more demanding back in the 70&#146;s (before the 
   advent of home video, when any hack could film people having sex and 
   release it on video). This movie seems more concerned with the plot 
   and the exploits of Zedeby Colt who is excellent in this role. When 
   we witness his preparation for an assault, it is truly frightening. 
   We see him strip naked, slip on a cock ring, snort amphetamines, 
   apply lipstick to his mouth and pull a stocking over his head. We all 
   know what is going to happen next. It is not a pretty sight and is 
   quite unbearable to watch, but watch we will (there is a voyeur in 
   all of us). The subject matter is not for the faint of heart 
   (feminists would have a field day with this one and rightly so). 
   Although the gore is amateurish (fake blood on bodies with no open 
   wounds) the squeamish should still stay away. Some people may say 
   that this film crosses the line, even for a porno film. They are 
   entitled to their opinion. Only the sickest of people would get a 
   rise out of what transpires in this film. The torture scenes are not 
   played to arouse. They are played to show how helpless a person can 
   be when their life is threatened; when they are no longer in control 
   of their own destiny. Do we need to see these kinds of acts? It&#146;s
    not for me to say, but I for one came away with a better 
   understanding on how it might feel to be in that type of situation. 
   The question still remains if I would recommend this film to you, the 
   readers. Not to be sexist, but I would have to say that if you are a 
   female, please do not watch this film alone. My wife had to get up 
   and leave the room when the first attack took place. She did not come 
   back until the film was over. I do not blame her. It affected me too. 
   If you are a male, please do not view this as a documentary. The last 
   thing we need is someone watching this film and copying the actions 
   on screen. Right-wingers and so-called &quot;guardians of the 
   public&quot; are just looking for an excuse to reopen the censorship 
   bandwagon. I believe everyone has the right to view what they please 
   (except pedophiles, those sick bastards!). Director Tim McCoy (a 
   pseudonym for New York ad man Victor Milk) also made the X-raters </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="erotic_dr_jekyll_1976.htm">THE
