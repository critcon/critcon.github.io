    section, as they are not necessarily foreign flicks, but 
   bottom-of-the-barrel, no-budget films usually in English that somehow 
   escaped from film prison and made their way onto DVD. Like TEN FOOT 
   POLE, these are films that I wouldn't watch on my best (or worst) 
   day, even if I swallowed an LSD sugar cube with a fifth of jack. 
   These are no-budget DTV films that, even those with a strong iron 
   constitution, would drive the most sane person to pick up a straight 
   razor and slit their wrists (vertically, not horizontally; if you are 
   going to do it, do it right!). This section is titled MAN VS. FILM 
   because it's Steven against the film and we will find out at the end 
   of each review whether Steven wins or the film does. If there is a

    Attendant</A><A NAME="Attendant2004"></A> (2004, USA, Horror, 
   Director: Corbin Timbrook)</FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT FACE="Arial Black,Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE="3">In 1972, four 
   tourists killed themselves in a group suicide at a remote camping 
   spot, leaving the police baffled.</FONT></FONT></P>
  <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In 2004, six other campers head for the same campsite, unaware they 
   face the same fate. This film is the story...of their journey there, 
   plus them setting up camp, with a little bit of horror thrown in at 
   the end. For a couple of minutes.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Often, film enthusiasts wonder what would happen if filmmakers took 
   everyone&#146;s favourite bit of a horror movie, that being the 
   banter between the victims, and made that the entire film. <B>THE ATTENDANT</B> 
   answers the call and delivers on that, giving us a full excruciating fifty-five
    minutes of nothing before anything happens.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But it doesn&#146;t stop there. Oh, no. <B>THE ATTENDANT</B> goes 
   one step further by making two of the potential victims the most 
   excruciating, annoying people who have ever appeared on screen. You 
   have Grace, a lawyer who nags her boyfriend Marco for calling in sick 
   to work so he can go camping with her because &#145;he has a duty of 
   responsibility to his employer&#146;. She&#146;s also supposed to be 
   the rational, level-headed one, which apparently involves shouting at 
   the top of her voice.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Grace, however, is like having an itchy elbow compared to the full 
   body psoriasis of character Deuce. Played by a guy called Stephen 
   Saux, who should remove that &#145;a&#146; from his name so it can 
   serve as a warning of his acting quality, Deuce simply cannot cross 
   the screen without doing something annoying. I&#146;m guessing his 
   acting instructions were &#145;you&#146;re the funny one, so do that 
   every single second you&#146;re on screen, even if you are in the 
   background with no dialogue. Hell, even if the script calls for you 
   to sit in a chair. Do it funnily.&#148;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    So while Deuce is larking it up and bouncing around and speaking bad 
   Spanish, there&#146;s four other people here &#150; Marco, a lame-o 
   who hasn&#146;t been camping before. Zoe, whom I think was the one 
   getting &#145;feelings&#146; about stuff that isn&#146;t followed up 
   on, a blonde girl I&#146;ve forgotten the name of and Jack, the 
   sensible one.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Be glued to your chair as we watch this lot enter a caf&eacute; to 
   ask for directions to a gas station! Try and conceal that priapism 
   from your family as they drive along a road talking about how Marco 
   can&#146;t swim! Sweat profusely as Deuce struggles to carry his 
   backpack! Laugh until blood spurts from your eyes when he hilariously 
   falls over onto his back! Cringe painfully as the spooky attendant 
   forces Deuce to buy a hand drawn map for ten cents.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Tremble as these moments are occasionally punctuated by someone 
   watching them from bushes or a ghost girl turning up or some <B><A HREF="blair_witch_project_1999.htm">BLAIR
    WITCH</A></B> stuff, a feeling of dread building and building within 
   you as you slowly realise you&#146;ve wasted an hour watching a 
   horror film full of what sounds like improvised dialogue among some 
   amateur dramatics people, filmed with a camcorder.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Worst part for me is the campfire scene, where Grace relates a story 
   of how she fought off a would-be rapist in her apartment. It goes on 
   forever and involves her telling everyone &#145;you don&#146;t know 
   what fear is&#146; before saying &#145;I wasn&#146;t scared at 
   all&#146; and ending with &#145;it was really scary&#146;. Like some 
   hideous punctuation mark, Jack then tops this off with a Jack 
   Nicholson impression so bad you can literally see a bit of the 
   actor&#146;s soul die as he says it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This film is truly one of the worst. An absolute waste of time from 
   start to finish which actively goes out of its way to annoy and 
   disappoint you. I would conclude that at least it&#146;s short at 
   seventy-one minutes, but it feels three or four times longer.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The film: A bunch of actors pretending to be soldiers running around 
   a park firing guns at a bunch of actors pretending to be aliens. For 
   the entire duration of the film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I understand budgets were low &#150; you can tell that by the 
   horrific CGI job on the helicopters, but the decision to film a small 
   group of actors arguing with a backdrop of some trees and grass for 
   an hour and a half is simply torture. I was ready to switch this one 
   off after ten minutes, and my quality standards for films are subterranean.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The plot as it is this: A paramedic is sucked into a war with some 
   aliens that have invaded Earth. The helicopter transporting him and 
   his fellow grunts is shot down and they have to wander around a park 
   evading aliens, trying to get a landing zone for uplift. Two Special 
   Ops guys who have joined them have a secret thing in a box which 
   turns out to a creature that organises the aliens (it looks like a 
   giant testicle!). Everyone argues and people die here and there until 
   the film ends with no resolution as to the alien invasion.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    And, Jesus, that&#146;s it. That&#146;s pretty much it. There 
   isn&#146;t even that much action involving the aliens (guys in rubber 
   masks). Just skirmishes with CGI muzzle flashes. One character starts 
   wearing a gas mask at one point, so I guess that was to cover up a 
   different actor being used for those scenes.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Wait, it says on the IMDB that actor Richard Alfieri, who plays 
   annoying artist Michael, also wrote the story for the film, so does 
   that mean he thought to himself &#147;I better put more scenes in 
   where I have a hissy fit for no reason&#148; and also &#147;this 
   story needs less horror, more painting&#148;?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Tortured NYC-based artist Michael is plagued by a recurring dream 
   where he has a moustache, which is bringing on his asthma, and a 
   tortured NYC is plagued by Michael. He&#146;s self-obsessed, bitchy, 
   non-punctual and in-subordinate in his art class, and it&#146;s 
   everyone else&#146;s fault that he&#146;s dreaming of a past life.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Things get serious when, one night while dreaming in his apartment, 
   his index finger suddenly pokes out and his cat goes flying straight 
   through the window into the street. That is the single interesting 
   moment in this entire film, which contains so little action or 
   suspense that I highly recommend it to people with serious heart 
   conditions and old ladies suffering with severe anxiety. You&#146;ve 
   got nothing to worry about here.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Michael somehow attracts the attention of ballet dancer Christine, 
   and she makes the mistake of moving in with him as his dreams 
   intensifies and he becomes louder, ruder and more abusive towards 
   her, making him unbearable to live with. That sounds like it might be 
   interesting, but actor Alfieri makes it look like a newly born kitten 
   getting angry at a ball of cotton wool.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Michael alternates between going to a medium who enables all his 
   crazy behaviour, alienating all his friends and colleagues by having 
   hissy fits, and hanging around with his mother. As the film goes on 
   the dreams reveal more and more but as you&#146;ve already guessed 
   Michael is dreaming of a past life where his brother kills him over a 
   woman and now his brother, who failed to be born as his twin, is 
   trying to ghost-boogie his way into Michael&#146;s life. Probably to 
   slap him around the face and tell him to shut the fuck up already. 
   Oh, and Michael was an artist in his past life too. Most likely a 
   shrill, insufferable one.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Even when he runs out of people to fall out with, Michael just has 
   an argument with himself instead, until the white knuckle ending 
   where he kills his ghost/twin brother in a car crash (don&#146;t ask 
   me) and everything&#146;s fine again, perhaps. The song at the end 
   gave me diabetes.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This one long, draggy, uneventful film, and I&#146;m a sucker for a 
   ghost story. The film&#146;s relentless single tone just goes on 
   forever, to the point where it causes amnesia. This film was released 
   in the UK by dodgy DVD company 23rd Century, who churned out about 
   one hundred and fifty films, all priced at a pound and mostly obscure 
   as they hadn&#146;t licensed any of them. You had awesome Italian 
   films like <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#LastHunter1980">THE LAST HUNTER</A></B> 
   and <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#After Fall NY">2019: AFTER THE

   this) but no one would mistake <B>FINAL SCREAM</B> for anything other 
   than a soulless cash grab executed without a hint of creativity.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The shitty slasher-film referencing script is bad enough, but the 
   all-white cast are so irritatingly perfectly coiffured and presented 
   that surely they can&#146;t exist in real life? It&#146;s almost as 
   if they themselves were manufactured, like there&#146;s a factory in 
   L.A. that produces cast members on demand. I&#146;m from the UK, how 
   do you think I feel looking at a cast of people with all their own 
   teeth? And wearing clothes they didn&#146;t steal from dead homeless people.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The premise to get all the victims of this thing in one place is 
   simple: rich jerk Kristin wants to reunite with estranged sister 
   Angela, and therefore arranges a party at a remote house with some 
   friends. However, what she really wants is to trial a murder mystery 
   weekend project she wants to sell to folks and is using Angela and 
   boyfriend Charlie as guinea pigs by not telling them what&#146;s 
   happening. Hell, there might be an added bonus in there if it drives 
   Charlie insane, seeing as how his family were previously murdered and 
   Kristin hates his guts because (memory missing &#150; film too crap).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Kristin sets up her fake murder night, but there&#146;s a real 
   killer in their midst who picks them off one by one as they wander 
   about in the dark looking for each other. Who cares? A little blood 
   there, a little self-reference here, a non-sensical reveal of the 
   killer&#146;s identity, and lame-ass twist and that&#146;s your rip-off.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Director David DeCoteau (who made another film in the exact location

   he&#146;s doing that he leaves errors such as the entire crew being 
   reflected in Kristin&#146;s sunglasses right at the start of the 
   film. If HE doesn&#146;t care about this film, why should I care?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    They all know the place is haunted. In fact, one of them tells the 
   story of what happened there years before, involving some douchebag 
   named Jake and a mechanic called Axel. Both worked in the yard but 
   hated each other, resulting in Jake &#145;pranking&#146; Axel by 
   having a car crush him to death. Now the ghost of Axel wanders the 
   yard, killing everyone because he thinks they&#146;re Jake, but to be 
   honest he just looks like a mechanic that&#146;s pissed off that

   again encountering Axel and his Hot Rod. He doesn&#146;t do too much

    This film is so bad that trying to explain the opening sequence is 
   bringing on a headache. In the future, a journalist goes to an 
   abandoned town on the instructions of an insane old lady and 
   retrieves a journal, only all the pages are ripped out. The old lady 
   chuckles and mutters &#147;Oh, they&#146;re good,&#148; and proceeds 
   to tell the events of the film, which is the source of what people 
   call the &#145;modern plague&#146;, but don&#146;t worry about that 
   because this is all just some sort of set up for the ridiculous 
   ending of the film. Also, the old lady is played by a young actress 
   in possibly the most cliched, pantomime way possible. I&#146;m 
   surprised she didn&#146;t shout &#147;What&#146;s that sonny?&#148;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Back in the present, town pariah Deke has just come home after a 
   stint in jail for murdering his stepfather (in self-defence). His 
   mother won&#146;t talk to him (as she doesn&#146;t know the truth 
   &#150; that Deke caught his stepfather in bed with his first wife), 
   his ex-girlfriend Sarah (the old lady) doesn&#146;t really want to 
   see him for the same reason, and the local sheriff is a total 
   douchebag who wants to run him out of town. Also, Sarah has another 
   ex/potential stalker in the form of Billy, who also wants to get rid 
   of Deke. This soap opera-level crap is interrupted when a meteor 
   lands outside of town, dispensing rubbery aliens that must have 
   watched <B><A HREF="they_came_from_within_1975.htm">SHIVERS</A></B> 
   on their way to Earth, because they invade people&#146;s bodies and 
   cause them to, well, not do much at all.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Sheriff Douche thinks that Deke is responsible for all the sudden 
   weirdness and throws him in jail, but Deke, with the help of Sarah 
   and Billy, manages to talk the Deputy into letting him go and even 
   giving him his gun (there&#146;s realism right there). This leads to 
   Deke and Douche having a tense standoff until one of the infected 
   pushes the Sheriff over and promptly runs away, leading to an uneasy 
   alliance of Deke, Douche, Billy and Sarah. Fortunately, the director 
   then decides to get everyone to hide out in a house so they can use 
   up the rest of the running time arguing with each other and not doing 
   much. Lucky escape for all those boredom addicts who were worried 
   something exciting was going to happen!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Where to begin with this one? <B>INFECTION: THE INVASION BEGINS</B> 
   is simply the lamest alien invasion film I&#146;ve ever seen. The 
   infected don&#146;t do much of anything. One appears in the 
   sheriff&#146;s office to scare the deputy, then disappears, as if 
   they remembered they had an important appointment somewhere else. 
   Most simply drag their victims to the ground to try and infect them. 
   The cook in the diner Sarah works in had been bitten on the knee by 
   one but you don&#146;t see it happen, and I&#146;m not sure if 
   it&#146;s the same guy who tries to bite Deke on the knee shortly 
   afterwards. Who knows when the focus on the film strictly on the main 
   characters doing the usual interminable arguing that sinks any low 
   budget film?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Further compounding the horror is the terrible script, which is 
   riddled with hackneyed lines lifted wholesale from other, better 
   films, spouted by actors who look familiar only because they&#146;ve 
   been picked for their generic appearance, and just when you think to 
   yourself &#145;oh, well, at least they&#146;re using practical 
   effects&#146; they pull out the shitty CGI card at the end, just to 
   erase any positive thoughts you&#146;d have about this one.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The final boot to the knackers is the ending, where the film returns 
   to the future. A young Deke turns up and rescues an old Sarah from 
   the loony bin, and when she asks why he&#146;s still so young, the 
   film cuts away before he explains. Thanks for that bit.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Almost devoid of blood and gore, nudity and violence, I get the 
   feeling that this film was made purposely to fill a slot on Sunday 
   afternoon TV.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">THE

    Gilbert Gill is a nineteen-year-old (sure, buddy) guy living with 
   his parents and seventeen-year-old (chortle) sister Janet. As usual, 
   Gilbert&#146;s father is berating him for burning the carpet, but 
   Gilbert&#146;s stepmother sends Gilbert away (she has the hots for 
   him), and Gilbert goes to the garage, where he makes strange objects 
   from children&#146;s toys, nails and knives. Janet goes to console 
   him but says the wrong thing, causing him to throw a hammer at her 
   head. Janet leaves and her dad falls asleep on the couch. Gilbert 
   then sneaks in, hits his dead on the head with the hammer, then 
   graphically smashes in his stepmother&#146;s face.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Either three years or one year later (depending on the dialogue and 
   on-screen text), Gilbert is tucked away in the worst mental 
   institution ever, where the inmates all wander around freely, the 
   staff laugh and berate the inmates (calling Gilbert a weirdo and 
   freak) and generally lounge around. Back home, Gilbert&#146;s father 
   is going to bring him home for the first time since the murder (try 
   not to apply logic) while Janet has her reservations. Not enough 
   reservations to stop her going to her friend&#146;s house to watch 
   horror films, that&#146;ll be the teenage Brook (who has laughter 
   lines and large breast implants). Also coming along is other friend 
   D.J (breast implants, hip replacement), and horny teenage boyfriends 
   Dane (grey hair, enlarged prostrate), Josh (grandchildren, wig) and 
   Lance (one testicle, PTSD from the Korean War). These 
   &#145;youngsters&#146; better watch out, as Gilbert is going to 
   escape in the stupidest way possible!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    You see, I think it&#146;s standard practice to give deranged 
   murderers things like metal forks unsupervised and then just decide 
   whether or not to check if he&#146;s hidden somewhere before being 
   murdered and having your colleague just listen through the door at 
   your corpse hitting the ground before they shout: &#145;Did you drop 
   something?&#146;, before they get killed too. Also, when senior staff 
   can&#146;t be bothered checking on all the screaming, it almost makes 
   sense that the worst insane asylum in history would just leave their 
   back door open. Why not?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Gilbert steals his father&#146;s car and heads home to start killing 
   his sister&#146;s friends, but things are padded out a bit as he 
   can&#146;t find her, his father can&#146;t find him, and Janet runs 
   afoul of a group of young kids who have a fantastic repertoire of 
   songs about her brother. Things culminate at the slumber party and

    The quality of this film is a bit higher than other films on this

   is so slow and depressing it only makes your day worse, like

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In New York City, depressed, forlorn Tom shares a crappy apartment 
   with lustful, bitter Nordi, where they languish, speaking of how they 
   can&#146;t pick up women or hold onto a decent job. Sometimes they 
   sit on the stairs outside and watch young women walk by. Sometimes 
   for variety they sit in an alleyway and watch nothing.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    If this film was set in the modern day I would guarantee that Nordi 
   would self-identify as one of those Incel freaks. He thinks 
   there&#146;s something up with women and that he never had any 
   trouble back in the &#145;Nam picking up chicks, and that it&#146;s 
   got nothing to do with him literally creeping out any young lady he 
   approaches. He gets the bright idea to put up an ad for a female 
   lodger in his local supermarket while Tom kind of mopes around 
   between his psychiatrist and his apartment, suffering the odd 
   flashback (in his head &#150; we don&#146;t get to see it).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Tom is slightly more successful with the ladies, however, even 
   picking up a girlfriend along the way, and he&#146;s also made some 
   headway with reconciling with his father, a headstrong macho-man who 
   works in the docks. It&#146;s a pity that Nordi derails everything by 
   raping and murdering a potential lodger in their apartment and 
   cajoling Tom into helping him dispose of the body. And then&ldots;the 
   film kind of falls back in the depressed rut it was trundling along 
   until about three minutes from the end.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There is sub-plot about the cop investigating the murder being an 
   old army buddy of Tom but that kind of dwindles away too, until some 
   activity happens at the end in the form of randomly appearing 
   character Danny Disco &#150; who tries to seduce Tom using dance!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    He initially comes looking to lodge at the apartment but kind of 
   breaks in instead and seems to like what he sees in Tom. He tells 
   them &#145;There&#146;s no stop signs on my street&#146; then begins 
   this ridiculous dance, each movement ending with Danny shouting 
   &#147;ZAT!&#148; and clutching his crotch. Somehow, this results in 
   him getting shot, then Tom and Nordi end up in jail and the film ends.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    I get that the film is trying to highlight the lack of support that 
   Vietnam vets received after the war and the lack of services to help 
   them manage the psychological damage they sustained while over there, 
   but did it have to be so boring? Or maybe that was the point &#150; 
   to show how burned out and unemotional these guys were that even rape 
   and murder is pretty banal. Peter Maloney from <B><A HREF="thing_1982.htm">THE

   This depressingly bad horror film makes you wonder how much random 
   fortune there is in the universe. There are those out there who have 
   the talent to create something truly unique that would forever be 
   burned into the memories and even the society that it is unleashed 
   upon, and yet the series of events that would lead to the creation of 
   said something never happens &#150; a prodigal artist distracted by 
   money concerns who ends up working a drive-thru just to pay the rent, 
   the greatest composer who ever lived never even getting the chance to 
   hold an instrument because his parents are worthless drug addict. 
   Life is full of cul-de-sacs and diversions, and not many of us ever 
   really get to see our dreams and aspirations made flesh.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   So how fucking annoying is it to see that someone as talentless as 
   Paul Gagne managed to be lucky enough to get a budget together only 
   to make a horrendous slasher film that just steals all its ideas from 
   other, better films, and squanders its running time on the usual 
   time-padding tricks like people wandering around looking for each 
   other? </FONT></FONT><BR>

   In some town that no one cares about, two horny teenagers (the 
   ancient kind you only get in slasher films) are getting it on when 
   the girl involved gets the idea to get it on in the local 
   slaughterhouse because something about suffering animals turning her 
   on, maybe. As they are going for it big style, the slaughterhouse guy 
   kills them with a sickle. Not that you really get to see anything.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   Five years later, some even older looking teenagers are having a 
   party. There&#146;s the jock guy and another guy and their 
   girlfriends, and then there&#146;s a stoner guy. Please note that 
   from the kills at the beginning of this film, nothing happens until 
   the forty-five minute mark, and a lot of that time is spent at this 
   party, with nothing particularly plot-relevant happening. There&#146;s
    even a lame soft-core lesbian session thrown in for no reason that 
   leads nowhere. </FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   The shitty plot is this: the two guys want to take their girlfriends 
   to the slaughterhouse in an abandoned town in order to scare them 
   with the legend of Marty Sickle, who was killed by the locals after 
   he murdered the two from the start of the film. In reality they are 
   going to scare the crap out of them with the help of stoner friend, 
   er, Stoner. They inadvertently raise Sickle from the dead with an 
   incantation, not knowing he&#146;s like Freddy Kruger&#146;s 
   unemployed cousin who is crap at everything.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   And that&#146;s the plot. Sickle is up and wandering about, the cast 
   are wandering about looking for each other, and eventually some kills 
   happen, some with terrible CGI and terribly one-liners, if you&#146;re
    lucky, then the film ends. </FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   There are literally no redeeming features to this film whatsoever and 
   I hated every second it was on my television, stinking my living room

   slasher film before taking a left turn into body horror, which would 
   have been entertaining if it wasn&#146;t so boring and badly handled.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    A year prior to the events of the film, young Melinda somehow 
   psychically sees her mother being murdered by a guy in a gas mask who 
   cuts in her half. In the present day, Melinda is having a birthday 
   party with her friends, who as you would imagine, are highly 
   irritating. They aren&#146;t worth naming either as most of them are 
   killed off in the first forty minutes of the film by the gas mask guy 
   who then reveals himself as Melinda&#146;s once-conjoined brother who 
   takes her off to a weird hospital run by a mad doctor</FONT></FONT><BR>

    What happens next is pretty much spoiled by the title of the film, 
   and its tag line &#147;Reunited &#150; one stitch at a time&#148;, 
   and the entire synopsis given on the back of my crappy Film 2000 DVD 
   (there&#146;s a terrible DVD company right there). I don&#146;t even 
   know how I ended up with this film. It just appeared in the 
   collection one day. Or maybe there&#146;s some traumatising memory 
   I&#146;m repressing involving the purloining of the film (there&#146;s
    no way I would have paid for it).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Anyway, I&#146;m all for making allowances for low budgets and such 
   like, but director Johnson seems more interested in style over story, 
   so we get the footage randomly switching from colour to black and 
   white for no good reason, quick-fire editing and flashbacks, but that 
   doesn&#146;t distract from the emptiness of the story and the 
   hackneyed slasher elements. Fine, there&#146;s a mad doctor in a 
   hospital experimenting with patients, but Johnson doesn&#146;t do 
   much with it outside of setting up the premise, and the pay off is lame.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    I don&#146;t have internet at home so in order to torture myself 
   I&#146;m pulling out the worst DVDs in my collection to review for 
   Fred&#146;s amusement. Wish me luck.</FONT></FONT><BR>
