   Ocean (near Los Angeles) and only two of them survive: Newman 
   (director/producer/screenwriter/editor/nose wiper Steve Barkett) and 
   Williams (special effects technician Jim Danforth). As they are 
   walking along the beach, they see the dessicated bodies of sunbathers 
   still in their beach chairs, which gives them their first glimpse 
   that something cataclysmic has happened. When they camp out that 
   night, they are attacked by deformed mutants, but fight them off. 
   This gives them their second glimpse that something very, very wrong 
   occurred. The next morning, they discover that Los Angeles is nothing 
   but a burned-out shell and they go to the nearest Civil Defense 
   station where Newman listens to a recording by a dead broadcaster 
   (voice supplied by Dick Miller) which tells Newman the story of the 
   apocalypse and how he is glad he has died before &quot;they&quot; 
   could get to him. Newman and Williams set up home base in an 
   abandoned mansion, where they set up a broadcast station looking for 
   survivors. Newman leaves the mansion with a Jeep and a rifle to look 
   for his wife and kids (apparently, as luck would have it, they lived 
   in Los Angeles). He drives through L.A. looking for his family and 
   must deal with radioactive acid rain, having nightmares about his 
   family turning into mutants, meeting a dying museum curator (an 
   extended cameo by Forrest J. Ackerman) who gives him a brief history 
   of what he missed while he was away in space and saddles him with a 
   little boy named Chris (Barkett's real-life son Christopher Barkett). 
   Newman and Chris have a run in with a roving band of pillagers and 
   rapists, led by Cutter (the always dependable Sid Haig), the 
   &quot;they&quot; that the dead broadcaster warned about. Newman and 
   Chris save a young woman named Sarah (Lynne Margulies, who has 
   nipples that could cut glass) from a mutant attack (she recently 
   escaped from Cutter's camp after he tried to rape her). Newman brings 
   them back to the mansion, where they become a surrogate family and 
   live <A HREF="aftermath_1980.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/aftermath vhs front3 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="132" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>a
    life of love and happiness (along with teaching Chris how to shoot a 
   pistol). Newman, Williams, Sarah and Chris raid Cutter's compound to 
   rescue some captives that Sarah knew, which leads Cutter to retaliate 
   with a raid on the mansion where he kills everyone except for Newman, 
   Williams and Chris. This leads to a bloody showdown in which only one 
   person will be left alive.&nbsp; Surprisingly (at least for me), 
   there are moments of extreme gore on view here, as can be witnessed 
   early on when Cutter and his gang graphically shoot some men they 
   have captured, ending with one old guy getting his head blown off 
   with a shotgun. The film pulls no punches when it comes to the 
   violence. Kids are shot and killed, women are graphically raped, 
   people are stabbed in the eye, blown up, set on fire and hit with 
   lots of bloody bullet squibs. It's kind of disorienting, because the 
   film also tries to be a loving family drama that is sometimes too 
   preachy for it's own good. The main problem with the film is that 
   it's much too ambitious for it's budget. One man auteur Steve Barkett (<B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#EmpireOfDark1991">EMPIRE

   - 1991) tries to cram too many ideas and ineffective special effects 
   into a film that must have cost less than most A-list films catering 
   budgets. He does get some help from effects experts Robert Skotak and 
   his brothers (who also play bit parts in the film), but most of the 
   effects are unconvincing, especially the matte painting of a 
   nuked-out Los Angeles. Another problem is that Barkett's screenplay 
   is all over the place. Newman first sets out to look for his family, 
   but quickly abandons his search once he picks up Chris and Sarah. It 
   then turns into a family drama and then a revenge plot as Newman gets 
   even with all those responsible for killing his new friends (and 
   lover). Still, <B><A HREF="aftermath_1980c.htm">THE AFTERMATH</A></B> 
   is an interesting misfire. If you can get past some of the hokey 
   effects (most are in the first few minutes) and some of the sugary 
   sweet sentimentality, you may find yourself liking it. One gets the 
   feeling when watching this that a bunch of movie fans got together 
   and decided to make a film. Everyone seems to have worked both in 
   front and behind the cameras on this. Even Eric Caidin, one of the 
   biggest collectors of movie memorabilia, has a role in this (as the

   - 1986) that has a good B-movie cast, but the storyline is nothing 
   but rehashed themes from countless other post-nuke epics. The 
   worldwide devastation is not caused by nuclear war, biological 
   warfare or another man-made disaster this time, but by a series of 
   off-the-Richter Scale earthquakes, which have reduced the Earth to 
   nothing but a pile of rubble (most of this film looks to have been 
   filmed in some abandoned industrial park). The world is now ruled by 
   an oppressive dictatorship led by Commander Eastern (Richard Lynch), 
   who has his second-in-command, Captain Quinn (John Saxon), and his 
   army search out and kill &quot;unregistered humans&quot; from their 
   hiding places (Nearly all humans have an identifying barcode tattooed 
   on their arms and this film doesn't hide the comparison to Jews 
   during the Nazi occupation in WW II). During one of these raids, a 
   female alien named Sabina (Elizabeth Kaitan) appears in a burst of 
   light and is captured by Quinn's army. <A HREF="aftershock_1989b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/aftershock 1989 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="174" HEIGHT="320" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>When
    Quinn notices that Sabina has no barcode and her bright red outfit 
   is made out of some unknown metal, he becomes intrigued, especially 
   when he discovers that she is carrying some photos and patches with 
   her (one photo is of Nancy Reagan!). It seems Sabina is a blank 
   slate, but she is a very quick learner (She learns English by reading 
   a dictionary/thesaurus on a 5.25&quot; floppy disk!) and becomes more 
   knowledgeable when Quinn sends her to a laboratory to be observed and 
   get a psych work-up. Meanwhile, sword-carrying and motorcycle-riding 
   loner Willie (Jay Roberts Jr.) travels the barren landscape looking 
   for a cause he can believe in. He stops at a bar run by Hank Franklin 
   (Russ Tamblyn) and is arrested by Quinn's right-hand man Mr. James 
   (James Lew, also the Stunt Coordinator) when he tries to defend an 
   underground female freedom fighter. He is brought to the same 
   facility where Sabina is being held and, after a series of events, he 
   escapes with Sabina and fellow prisoner Danny Girrard (Chuck 
   Jeffries, doing his best Eddie Murphy impression). They steal a car 
   and end up at the underground base of freedom fighter leader Colonel 
   Slater (Christopher Mitchum), who has a history with Willie. 
   Commander Eastern orders Quinn to bring back Sabina no matter what 
   the cost because the tests they performed on her in the lab proves 
   that she is an alien (and a newborn one to boot!), so Quinn hires 
   top-notch &quot;Apprehender&quot; Brandt (Chris DeRose) to bring her 
   back alive and kill everyone else. This leads to a series of chases, 
   fights and shootouts, as Willie tries to protect Sabina while falling 
   in love with her (Ewwww! He's falling in love with an alien baby!). 
   Willie must return Sabina to her original entry point before time 
   runs out or else she will die. The remainder of the film details 
   Willie's efforts to get Sabina off the planet so she can stop the 
   Earth from being destroyed. From what I just witnessed, our planet is 
   better off without us.&nbsp; There's not much to recommend here 
   except watching a bunch of talented actors trying to keep a straight 
   face while spouting groan-inducing dialogue. The screenplay, by 
   Michael Standing (who also gives himself the role of Gruber, Colonel 
   Slater's right-hand man), is nothing but a mishmash of post-nuke 
   clich&eacute;s, most of them done much better in the Italian 
   post-apocalypse rip-offs of the early-to-mid-80's (The only funny bit 
   comes when Quinn tells Brandt that Willie's barcode scanned as a 
   &quot;can of Chinese mushrooms manufactured in Taiwan in the year 
   1987. Obviously a mistake.&quot;). The action scenes, including the 
   car chases, fight scenes and gun battles, are strictly second-rate 
   and the violence is rather subdued for an R-rated flick (Not to 
   mention that Ms. Kaitan has no nude scenes). Director Frank Harris 
   takes a lazy approach to nearly every aspect of this film, which may 
   be why he gave up directing and is mainly a cinematographer now (he 
   photographed the reprehensibly bad <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Transformed2003">TRANSFORMED</A></B> 
   in 2003). <B><A HREF="aftershock_1989.htm">AFTERSHOCK</A></B> is the 
   equivalent of eating a bad Chinese meal. Not only will you be hungry 
   again one hour later, you'll still have an awful taste in your mouth 
   that just won't seem to go away (Maybe it's from that can of Chinese 
   mushrooms from 1987!). Michael Berryman and Matthais Hues put in 
   extended cameos as two muscle-headed idiots named Queen and Cassidy 
   who kidnap Sabina towards the end of the film. Berryman wears bright 
   red lipstick and, at one point, dons a bright red wig, which makes 
   him looks like a freakish drag queen. Originally available on VHS

   This is one of the few Italian post-nuke films to actually get a 
   theatrical release in the States and is one of the better ones. In 
   2019, after a nuclear war, the entire Earth is a burned-out wasteland 
   where there hasn't been a human birth for over twenty years. The 
   Earth is controlled by two factions: The iron-fisted European-African 
   Conference (Eurac) and the much more malevolent Pan American 
   Confederacy (PAC). Eurac, which controls New York, is in the middle 
   of performing an ethnic cleansing, killing all those infected with 
   radiation or deformed in any way. Enter Parsifal (Michael Sopkiw), a 
   loner and part-time bounty hunter who makes money on the side by 
   participating in deadly car races. While in Nevada, he is knocked-out 
   and brought to PAC's headquarters in Alaska, where PAC's president 
   (Edmund Purdom) informs him that the last fertile woman is in New 
   York City and he wants Parsifal to find her <A HREF="after_the_fall_of_new_york_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/after the fall of new york vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="131" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>and
    bring her back to headquarters, his reward being a seat on a rocket 
   to the Alpha Centauri galaxy, where a habitable planet awaits to 
   start the human race over again. He joins forces with Bronx (Vincent 
   Scalondro) and Ratchet (Roman Geer), two PAC soldiers, and begins 
   their search in the bowels of NYC, where they must fight and kill a 
   series of increasingly difficult undesirables and degenerates, not to 
   mention some hungry sewer rats. The trio meet a group of people (who 
   dine on rats), led by Rat Eater King (post-nuke regular Al 
   Yamanouchi), and are taken prisoner. When Eurac soldiers invade the 
   camp, they take Parsifal and Bronx (Ratchet avoids capture), along 
   with Rat Eater girl Giara (Valentine Monnier), back to headquarters 
   for torture and experimentation. When they finally escape from Eurac 
   headquarters (with Ratchet's help), Bronx is killed and they travel 
   through the sewers with the help of a tribe of dwarves, led by Shorty 
   (Louis Ecclesia). Shorty leads them to the fertile woman, who is the 
   daughter of a scientist who has kept her in a state of suspended 
   animation since before the bombs were dropped. They must use an 
   ancient station wagon (upgraded with some added armor) to travel 
   through a heavily protected Lincoln Tunnel to escape to safety, but a 
   deception within the group (one of them is a cyborg) may bring the 
   whole mission to a screaming halt.&nbsp; Director Sergio Martino

   moving non-stop and throws in a lot of bloody carnage, too. People 
   have their eyes poked out (and have a new pair inserted into the 
   empty sockets!), their stomachs slit open, shot, stabbed, impaled, 
   you name it and it's here. George Eastman (<B><A HREF="grim_reaper_1980.htm">THE
    GRIM REAPER</A></B> - 1980) makes a welcome appearance in the final 
   third of the film as Big Ape, the leader of a neanderthal-like tribe, 
   who believes he's the last fertile man in the world (he's quite funny 
   at times). Eastman also displays an intimate and memorable attachment 
   to the sleeping beauty as he offers himself up for sacrifice for the 
   sake of the future, but not before leaving the future a surprise they 
   will not likely ever forget. Michael Sopkiw (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Massacre Dinosaur">MASSACRE
    IN DINOSAUR VALLEY</A></B> - 1985) is a pretty one-note actor but 
   makes a serviceable action hero, fighting and shooting his way 
   through numerous encounters. The sequence where the motley group must 
   drive through the booby-trapped Lincoln Tunnel may remind you a 
   little of <B><A HREF="escape_from_new_york_1981.htm">ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK</A></B> 
   (1981), but it stands out as an exciting action sequence anyway. So, 
   if you like films that depict the future as a dark, desolate 
   landscape with very little hope for redemption, this film should be 
   right up your alley. This is pretty grim shit. A <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Vestron Video">Vestron

   sneaks onto a helicopter and escapes, jumping out of the copter when

   snake hunter. Bob tricks the guards into following him and Jane into 
   a cave, where the guards are bitten by cobras and die. Bob brings 
   Jane to his base camp (a converted, hollowed-out school bus) and 
   introduces her to his collection of snakes, including his pet cobra, 
   Blossom (When Jane misinterprets Bob's motives, she screams at him, 
   &quot;Don't touch me, you snake squeezer!&quot;, but ends up screwing 
   him anyway). As Jane and Bob formulate a plan to save Lee, Col. 
   Kovacks and his crew have a new problem: The appearance of a UFO and 
   it's alien occupant, which lands in the ocean next to the E-Chem 
   plant. The alien (which has giant black crab claws) moves underground 
   as it heads to the E-Chem plant, occasionally popping-up to the 
   surface to kill or infect anyone it touches, including a rescued Lee, 
   who commits suicide by jumping off a cliff once he becomes infected 
   and starts to decompose. It's not long before everyone is fighting 
   for their lives, as the alien attacks E-Chem, leaving only Jane and

   any sense at all. Major plot points are simply dropped to advance the 
   film and the silly alien (A giant claw? Really?), who we finally see 
   in all it's giant glory in the finale (it's a life-sized mechanical 
   puppet that looks like something H.R. Giger would create if given 
   $3.00), really makes this a slog to sit through. Charles Napier (who 
   seems to be the only one in the cast to dub his own voice) is wasted 
   here in his role as a one-note villain. This lackluster cross between <B><A HREF="raiders_of_the_lost_ark_1981.htm">RAIDERS

   action flick. A squad of hooded crooks invades the Hastings 
   Supermarket in Buck Lake, Arizona just as it is closing, but after a 
   very short period of time, it becomes obvious that these people may 
   not be crooks at all and they're certainly not after money. Spooky 
   (Philip Newby), a member of the gang who has extrasensory powers, 
   begins scanning all the remaining people in the supermarket (by 
   grabbing their heads in his hands), saying either &quot;They are 
   one&quot; or &quot;No, they aren't one&quot; and those that &quot;are 
   one&quot; quickly get a bullet in their brain and their bodies thrown 
   in the market's freezer. Before Spooky can scan everyone, he is shot 
   dead by a customer that happens to be a cop, forcing Ritter (Carlos 
   Bernard - TV's <B><A HREF="24_tv_series.htm">24</A></B>), the head of 
   the squad, to improvise. As the local police surround the

   of a dead victim and tries to <A HREF="alien_raiders_2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/alien raiders dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="183" HEIGHT="267" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>come
    up with a plan of action to find out if the rest of the hostages are 
   &quot;one of them&quot; or not. Transplanted Chicago cop Seth 
   Steadman (Matthew St. Patrick - <B><A HREF="six_feet_under_tv_series_2001-2005.htm">SIX
    FEET UNDER</A></B> [2001 - 2005]), whose stepdaughter Whitney 
   (Samantha Streets) is one of the hostages, tries to figure out why a 
   highly-trained military group picked this place to rob, while Ritter 
   and female medical officer Sterling (Courtney Ford) make all the 
   hostages drink large quantities of milk (to change their pH level) 
   before performing a &quot;snip test&quot; on them (which involves 
   cutting off one of their pinkies!). As the film progresses, it also 
   becomes obvious that some of these hostages are infected with an 
   alien organism that crash-landed in a meteor in Buck Lake; an alien 
   organism so deadly, the Earth is doomed unless Ritter and his squad 
   can stop the infection from spreading. Some stupid heroics by the 
   hostages leads to the infection spreading, but the arrival of 
   drug-addled Charlotte (Bonita Friedericy), a former member of 
   Ritter's squad who has the same powers as Spooky, may be a solution 
   to the problem, but she wants massive amount of drugs first before 
   she will help. Meanwhile, Ritter begins losing members of his squad 
   to a &quot;King&quot;, the strongest member of the alien species. 
   Seth begins to uncover the truth, while Whitney and stock boy Benny 
   (Jeff Licon) join forces with Ritter and Sterling to hunt down and 
   kill the King. Just when it seem that they've achieved their 
   objectives (but not without more deaths), the surprise ending reveals 
   that the King is still alive, baby, and ready to appear in a 
   sequel.&nbsp; This is a tense, well-acted horror/action film that 
   doesn't immediately play all it's cards like most modern genre films 
   do. It builds slowly, but not boringly, offering the audience kernels 
   of knowledge as the film progresses. We know almost immediately that 
   the market &quot;robbery&quot; is not a robbery at all (it's more of 
   a cleansing), but director Ben Rock (who, before this, directed the 
   fake documentaries <B><A HREF="burkittsville_7_shadow_of_the_blair_witch_2000.htm">THE

   of the cold, have visited this planet on more than one occasion and 
   are known about by the government, yet they offer no help to Ritter 
   and his crew when they desperately need it. For a film that spans so

   Back at the cave, the aliens kill the last remaining deputy and 
   Professor Chambers and kidnap Stacie (Ashley Shemrick), leaving 
   Towers and Carol (Jodi Seronick) to fight for survival (maybe for the

   bug-eyed kind (which are intelligent) and the larger, more dangerous, 
   lizard-like kind, which are the aliens' muscle. Towers and Carol 
   stumble on an alien breeding ground, where humans are put in cocoons 
   and injected with alien DNA, turning them into zombie slave labor. 
   After saving her friend Stacie from a cocoon, Towers and Carol blow 
   up the mine with dynamite. They drive back into town, only to find 
   everything destroyed. With the use of his laptop and an alien device 
   that Towers stole off of a dead alien, scientist Max (Aaron

   The aliens are pretty good (they are physical effects), but all the 
   ships and much of the destruction is created by computer and it is 
   painfully obvious by the long shot of the alien ships attacking the 
   city (CGI fire effects still have a long way to go to look 
   believable). The damn cheat of an ending is still pissing me off 
   because nothing is resolved. Charles Napier (who gets top billing) is

   on board the transport ship is reporter Ray Peterson (Rik Van Nutter; <B><A HREF="foxbat_1977.htm">FOXBAT</A></B> 
   - 1977), who is there to film a story on man's first trip to Mars. He 
   takes a spacewalk (with his camera and without a safety line!) to 
   board artificial satellite ZX34, the ship taking the trip to Mars. 
   Once on board ZX34, Ray meets the ship's doctor King 116 (Joe 
   Pollini; <B><A HREF="man_with_icy_eyes_1971.htm">THE MAN WITH ICY EYES</A></B>

   Ray butts heads with the ship's commander, George (David Montresor), 
   who doesn't like him being on his ship, but he has orders to 
   cooperate with him. Ray then takes another space walk to watch the 
   crew at work, without George's permission, and sees that one of the 
   crew members is in the path of an approaching meteor. Ray pushes the 
   crew member out of the way and nearly ruins everyone's chance of 
   going to Mars. George chews-out Ray, telling him if he wants to do 
   anything, he will have to ask his permission first (Hey, George, can

   out-of-control abandoned space station is heading towards Earth and 
   if they don't stop it, all life on Earth, and the planet itself, will 
   be destroyed (the space station's photon generators are radiating 
   enough heat to destroy Earth). Ray and George (who also has a thing 
   for Lucy) will have to put their differences aside and come up with a 
   plan to stop the rudderless ship from reaching Earth's atmosphere. 
   Ray, once again without George's permission, takes another spacewalk 
   and boards the errant space station to try and rectify the problem. 
   He doesn't notice that he is running low on oxygen until it is too

   This film is a slog to get through because 'Executive Producer&quot; 
   Samuel Z. Arkoff (who had nothing to do with the making of this film) 
   felt the need to add narration from Ray to the whole film, repeating

   life trying to save Earth (and failing). On the negative side, all of 
   the actors are as stiff as overly-starched underwear and the special

   about the delicate balance between what is man and what is machine. 
   Olivier Gruner, one of action film's better martial artists and 
   actors (he has this sly look that's disarming), gives a nuanced 
   performance as a &quot;Tick&quot; (a derogatory term for an 
   Automatic) who, at first, seems cold and unemotional, but as he and 
   Nora make their way through the different levels of the RobGen 
   Building (it's like a live-action video game), he begins to realise 
   that there's barely any difference between him and most humans, 
   especially the heartbreaking sequence where he discovers a laboratory 
   where his fellow Automatics are experimented on in various painful 
   ways. Since they all look like him, it's a turning point in his 
   education on the human condition. As a matter of fact, as the film 
   progresses, Nora and J269 seem to switch personalities, as she begins 
   killing people to protect him. This is one of the better DTV sci-fi 
   action flicks of the 90's, thanks to plentiful gunfights and 
   explosions, biting humor, social commentary and a really good 
   surprise reveal towards the end of the film that ties everything 
   together rather nicely. It really is a stunner that I didn't see 
   coming. I like a film that can still surprise me in this day and age.

   not-too-distant future. While Trash is supplying ammunition to a 
   group of underground revolutionaries, led by Dablone (Antonio

   President Henry Clark (Thomas Moore), is killing all the occupants of 
   the Bronx to make way for total urban renewal, a brand-spanking new

   The violence is over-the-top, as people are burned alive, shot, 
   blown-up or have their skulls crushed with a baseball bat or butt of 
   a rifle, all done in super slow motion. While the script (by 
   Castellari and Tito Carpi) is generic chase-and-kill stuff, the 
   action set-pieces are pretty good, including the chase through the 
   sewers and the slaughter witnessed by Moon and Jay, where one poor 
   sap has a bomb involuntarily strapped to his body, which explodes 
   when some street gang members try to remove it. As far as the acting 
   goes, let's just say that it doesn't really matter. Henry Silva (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CryOfAProstitute">CRY

    Opulus, where Maria is reunited with her long-lost father Zeus, a 
   scientist who is working on a cure for radiation poisoning. We also 
   find out that Malsam is afflicted with a strange disease where he 
   begins to mutate every time he looks at the moon (When he sees the 
   moon one night, he tells his men, &quot;Take it away and I'll cover 
   it in blood!&quot; Double what!?! Some of his men turn to each other 
   and say, &quot;He has a devil inside him!&quot; and &quot;He's not 
   just crazy. He's a lunatic!&quot;). Malsam will not rest until Rex is 
   dead, so he hires a band of beefy warriors to capture Rex and bring 
   him back, which they do (without very much trouble at all). Rex must 
   fight a series of battles in the arena, each one more dangerous than 
   the last. Just when things begin looking grim for Rex, Maria shows up 
   with a &quot;Liquidation Squad&quot;, an army of rocket launcher and 
   machine gun-carrying men who help Rex defeat Malsam's men. The rest 
   of the film is just a series of gunfights and explosions until Rex 
   confronts Malsam for a lightsaber duel (!), where Rex quickly defeats 
   Malsam (he explodes into a million little pieces when Rex cuts him in 
   half with the lightsaber!) and Maria and Rex share a passionate kiss 
   before Rex jumps on his horse and heads off on another adventure, 
   which audiences never got to see (because it was never filmed). Maybe 
   he died of radiation poisoning.&nbsp; This is strictly lower-tier 
   Filipino action cinema that's pretty rough going for the viewer. I 
   guess it would help to view the first film (which I didn't at the 
   time of this review, but have seen since), but I really doubt if it 
   would make a big difference. The Greek subtitled version I viewed 
   edits out most of the gory footage and the English dubbing is so bad, 
   it's almost surreal. Most of the impalements, axe fights (which seems 
   to be the weapon of choice here) and gun battles end abruptly and 
   those edits get quite annoying after a short period of time. We don't 
   watch these films for the storylines, you know, so editing out all 
   the gore kind of defeats the whole purpose of watching it in the 
   first place. I'm sure director Willie Milan (<B><A HREF="ultimax_force_1986.htm">ULTIMAX
    FORCE</A></B> - 1986) didn't mean for this film to be as awful as 
   this edition makes it out to be, but the atrocious dubbing (the word 
   &quot;arena&quot; is pronounced &quot;areener&quot; and the dubbing 
   crew can't seem to make up their minds if Gabby Parro's character 
   name is &quot;Maria&quot; or &quot;Reya&quot;) and lack of bloody 
   violence in this version makes it a tough sitting for the viewing 
   audience, even if it's only 73 minutes long. The only interesting 
   (and weird) points this film has to offer are Malsam's aversion to 
   the moon (which is quickly dropped) and counting how many times you 
   spot people standing around in a circle (which is a lot!). Also

   kills one of their crew. Running dangerously low on air and knowing 
   that they will eventually have to go back to the German ship, they 
   run into Hans (Klaus Kinski), the lone survivor of the German crew 
   who doesn't seem to be telling all he knows about the death of his 
   crew. What he does tell them is that they have discovered some 
   alien's &quot;butterfly collection&quot; or zoo, a collection of 
   creatures from other galaxies and one of them has woken up. This 
   creature is a parasite, able to control anything it touches by 
   placing a smaller alien creature on it's victim's head, the smaller 
   creature taking over the brain. Hans leads an expedition back to his 
   ship and they are attacked by some reanimated corpses (all with those 
   little creatures attached to their heads). It becomes obvious after a 
   short time that the alien is using the reanimated humans as manpower 
   it needs to operate the German ship and get it back to Earth. As the 
   alien takes over more of the American crew, the remaining unaffected

   an environment where oxygen (or lack of) is a commodity that we take

   (I'm sensing a theme...), mangled corpses, death by raygun and flesh

   turns into a cutesy family drama, where the seemingly parent-free duo 
   of Susan and Brandon welcome the cyborg into their opulent home 
   unconditionally, it loses all forward momentum and never regains it's 
   footing. What's even more mind-numbingly irrational are the tactics 
   Hammer employs to kill the cyborg, murdering innocent people on the 
   street and in a crowded restaurant (where Susan tries to teach the 
   cyborg to dance!) without the slightest hint of regret. Quite the 
   contrary, Hammer (played with usual wide-eyed intensity by Henry 
   Silva, as he spouts lines like, &quot;Piece of shit sardine 
   can!&quot;) seems to relish the violence and the police are nowhere 
   to be found to offer him any resistance. Frank Zagarino is perfect as 
   a cyborg because, let's face it, he has about all the personality of 
   a cash register at Denny's (Zagarino later perfected his robotic 
   skills by portraying an android in <B><A HREF="project_shadowchaser_1991.htm">PROJECT:

   Peter Weller in <B><A HREF="robocop_1987.htm">ROBOCOP</A></B> (1987), 
   while over-exaggerated mechanical sound effects are heard on the 
   soundtrack and every time he speaks, the dubbed-in voice makes it 
   sound like he's talking in a tunnel. Considering De Rossi's 
   involvement, the effects are particularly low-rent; just plenty of 
   bloody bullet squibs and a scene where the cyborg peels off half his 
   burned face, revealing his metal skeleton underneath (Where have I 
   seen that before?) and then pouring some liquid skin over the exposed 
   area (Where the hell did he get liquid skin?). <B><A HREF="cy_warrior_1989c.htm">CY

   DeAngelis was once contracted to direct this using his &quot;Larry

   move.), is a pretty weak sci-fi actioner that didn't impress me in 
   any department. As a matter of fact, I've seen better robotic 
   movements by drunk relatives on the dance floor of wedding 
   receptions. Also starring James Summers, Bill Hughes, Ron Lang,

   Made-in-Australia sci-fi/horror film that is a freshman effort for 
   nearly evereyone behind and in front of the cameras, and while the 
   plot may be old hat, the frenetic presentation adds a shot of 
   adrenaline to the proceedings. In the distant future, Reaserch 
   Station 320, located on some unnamed planet, places a distress call 
   stating that they are under attack from at least &quot;five different 
   mutations&quot; and the situation looks dire. The captain of a 
   passing ship owned by the rich and powerful IDGAF Corporation orders 
   that the research station be sealed and to keep it a secret. We then 
   watch as a female (Tonia Renee) wakes up in a totally white room. She 
   has &quot;SC17&quot; tattooed on her arm and seems totally confused. 
   She takes a shower and begins to have a massive nosebleed, when two 
   guys in bio-contamination suits enter the room and try to kill her, 
   but a creature slaughters the two guys and the woman escapes. We then 
   learn that the <A HREF="dark_lurking_2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dark lurking dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>woman
    is one of eight survivors of Research Station 320, yet she has no 
   memory of how she has gotten here. It seems the research station has 
   been contaminated with some biological virus, which has turned most 
   of the humans there into all sorts of flesh-hungry mutations. Those 
   who haven't been infected with the virus must avoid even being 
   scratched by the mutations for fear of instant contamination and 
   transformation. The survivors, who include mercenaries Dare (Anthony 
   Edwards), Michaels (Bret Kennedy) and Kirkland (Ozzie Devrish), as 
   well as scientists and &quot;lab rats&quot; Yutani (Roslyn Van 
   Doorn), Canning (Davyd Williams) and Jen (Cassia Rosenstraus), try to 
   make their way to the planet's surface while battling the hordes of 
   mutations, many of them whom were once their friends. The mysterious 
   amnesiac woman begins to have seizures and, while she is unconscious, 
   can see what the mutations are doing, like she has some psychic 
   connection to them. As you can probably guess, the mutations begin 
   chowing-down on the survivors one-by-one as they try to make their 
   way to safety, while the mercenaries argue among themselves if it is 
   worth risking their lives trying to protect the civilians (in the 
   mercs' defense, most of the civilians are a thankless lot). When 
   their numbers start dwindling, they become trapped in a laboratory 
   occupied by Konieg (Dirk Foulger), a scientist who knows more about 
   the amnesiac woman than he is letting on. What is this woman's 
   connection to the mutations and will anyone make it out alive before 
   the IDGAF Corporation nukes the station and denies all 
   knowledge?&nbsp; Although obviously shot on a shoestring budget with 
   less than stellar acting (most of the mercenaries are portrayed by 
   professional stuntmen), first-time director/screenwriter Greg Connors 
   manages to pack a lot of action and gory bloodshed, not to mention 
   some excellent makeup effects, into the mix. Besides the various 
   mutated creatures, there are head explosions, limb removals (Yutani 
   has her hand ripped-off and Kirkland cauterizes the wound with a 
   flare), disembowelments, various bloody clawings and slashings and 
   lots of squishy bullet squibs. If there's a quibble about this film, 
   it's that it relies a little too much on the shakey-cam 
   cinematography technique or strobe light effects during the action 
   scenes (probably used to hide its low-budget roots) and a ridiculous 
   (although inventive) third act explanation about the mutations (It 
   has to do with the Nazi's finding a fossil of the original angel, 
   Lucifer, during World War II and Konieg using DNA from the fossil for 
   cloning experimentations. Far-fetched? You betcha!). Those are just 
   minor distractions, though, in an otherwise thoroughly enjoyable and 
   gory &quot;monsters-on-the-loose&quot; sci-fi flick. Sure, it's an <B><A HREF="alien_1979c.htm">ALIEN</A></B> 
   (1979) clone (although it reminds me more of the Roger

   of human life&quot; or else the robots will be activated and wipe out 
   all traces of human life, putting our planet back in the state it was 
   before we began ruining it. When the U.S. government stupidly ignores 
   Sky's warning and try to destroy one of the robots with missiles 
   (which are ineffective and result in the destruction of three jets), 
   the whole world loses electrical power. Josh breaks Sky out of 
   captivity and he tries to show her the value of human life (good luck 
   there!), with Prewitt and the military not far behind. Can a simple 
   schmo like Josh convince Sky to stop the Earth from spinning off its 
   axis and stopping dead in it's tracks? When he takes Sky to church 
   and tries to explain the concept of God (good luck there!), she taps

   old!), as it is nothing but talky pseudo-babble about man's worth and 
   cheap CGI effects (we hear about 666 robots, but we only see one at a 
   time). Like I said earlier, only Ms. McCafferty's nude sequence in 
   the beginning holds the viewer's interest and when she is finally 
   clothed (apparently, alien women wear bras), the film stops dead in 
   it's tracks, much like the Earth in this film. Not even a 
   late-in-the-film cameo by Judd Nelson (who gets second billing in the

   interesting Charles Band production (pre-Empire and Full Moon), a 
   family gets caught in a time vortex when their new solar powered home 
   in the desert is hit with a strange phenomenon after three far-away 
   stars go supernova. A green-glowing alien object (which looks like a 
   miniature pyramid) suddenly appears in their backyard and when it is

    it into the house. Things start to get weird when the family 
   patriarch (Jim Davis) and matriarch (Dorothy Malone) see two UFOs 
   flying overhead while taking a stroll at night. Things get 
   progressively stranger when a large cracked mirror seems to fix 
   itself, rooms start glowing green, small alien creatures start 
   roaming the house and a miniature spaceship chases everyone around 
   while shooting lasers at them. After a while it becomes apparent that 
   they are caught in a time warp, where the past, present and future 
   all exist at the same time (hence the mirror seemingly fixes itself 
   when, if fact, they were looking at the mirror before it was 
   cracked). Son-in-law Richard (the expressionless Chris Mitchum), who 
   was away on a business trip, worries when he cannot contact them by 
   phone, so he begins a drive back to the house. Meanwhile, the family 
   try to leave the house, but are stopped by strange lights in the sky. 
   Before the night is through, the family will view plenty of alien 
   ships, two giant creatures fighting each other (the winner then turns 
   his attention to the family), they are transported to some alien 
   technology graveyard and trapped in a never-ending series of travels 
   back and forth through time. When Richard gets to the house, he sees 
   it disappear but, for some unexplained reason, he is reunited with 
   his family and they start a new life on an alien planet. What?!?&nbsp;

   destroyed by the opening narration) and, although the story line is 
   somewhat unique, the cheapness of the production hampers it's overall 
   effectiveness. Nearly all the effects are done via stop-motion 
   animation (supervised by Dave Allen) and some of them look 
   unfinished, especially the scenes of the two giant aliens fighting. 
   The optical effects are even cheaper looking, especially the scenes 
   of the time warp surrounding the house. Still, for a small film, it 
   is effects-laden and attempts to tell a story that, clearly, the 
   budget couldn't sustain. The ending really doesn't make a lick of 
   sense and seems tacked-on, as if the screenwriters (Wayne Schmidt, J. 
   Larry Carroll and David Schmoeller) couldn't figure out a way to end 
   it properly with the budget they were given, so they left it 
   open-ended. Since a sequel was never made, let's hope they lived 
   happily ever after. This played theatrically on a <A HREF="day_time_ended_laserblast_ad_mat.htm">double

   In the future world of 1997 Earth, disease has spread throughout the 
   land and there are three distinct groups of people: The uninfected, 
   who are free to move about wherever they please; The diseased, who 
   are put into &quot;Plague Zones&quot; and can never leave, and: 
   &quot;Zero Men&quot;, males who are infected with a non-transmittable 
   strain of the disease and only have one to two years to live. The 
   Zero Men are known to have extremely tempermental behavior because of 
   their short life expectancy. One ultraviolent Zero Man, Decker (Brion 
   James), escapes from a prison van and heads into the nearest Plague 
   Zone to hide. He, along with a couple of other prison escapees, stop

    Zone, knowing full well that the police will never follow. Chaz 
   (Jeffrey Combs), Leila's chauffeur (and possible lover) hires devil-may-care
    Zero Man John Luger (Wings Hauser) to lead him into the Plague Zone 
   to rescue Leila. As Luger and Chaz track Decker, they find nothing 
   but death and destruction (including a boobytrapped severed head) 
   left in his wake. Decker catches Luger and Chaz off-guard and buries 
   them up to their necks in the blazing sun. They are rescued by a 
   nomad farmer (Leland Crooke) and his hideously deformed sister Pookie 
   (Penelope Sudrow). After giving the farmer Chaz's &quot;pain 
   pills&quot; in exchange for oil (for their car), guns and Pookie (who 
   dies the next morning from the disease), Luger and Chaz head to Cafe 
   Death, where the dregs of society go to drink, fight and watch a live 
   stage show where infected people are killed in graphic ways. Decker 
   gets the drop on Luger (again) and uses jumper cables and a car 
   battery to torture Luger. Chaz rescues Luger and they have a final 
   showdown with Decker in a junkyard, where Chaz makes a startling 
   revelation to Luger about his &quot;pain pills&quot; and Leila puts a 
   few rounds into Decker. Luger then makes a move that will change all 
   of humanity.&nbsp; This is one of Gregory Dark's (here using the 
   pseudonym &quot;Gregory Brown&quot;) rare forays into mainstream 
   filmmaking (others being <B><A HREF="street_asylum_1990.htm">STREET ASYLUM</A></B> 
   [1990 - also with Hauser] and the recent <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#See No Evil 2006">SEE

    INSTINCTS: THE SEDUCTRESS</A></B> (1995) using the name 
   &quot;Alexander Gregory Hippolyte&quot;. Dark borrows motifs from 
   many films for <B><A HREF="dead_man_walking_1987b.htm">DEAD MAN WALKING</A></B>,
    most notably the recurring TV news breaks from <B><A HREF="robocop_1987.htm">ROBOCOP</A></B> 
   (made the same year as this), right down to using the same actor (the 
   late Mario Machado) to play the news anchor (he played &quot;Casey 
   Wong&quot; in all three <B>ROBOCOP </B>films). Some parts of this 
   film are highly inventive, such as our initial introduction to Luger, 
   where we see him in a bar playing a deadly Russian roulette game with 
   another patron that involves a chainsaw, their necks and a pull on 
   the starter rope. Another funny sight is Luger's car: It's a 
   hollowed-out AMC Pacer made to look like a dune buggy. The film is 
   violent (plenty of gunshots to the head, a neck snapping, a man 
   turned into a fireball), funny (Chaz's first meeting with Luger 
   involves him holding a ticking bomb while Luger tries to disarm it) 
   and it has something to say about society and how it classifies 
   people (Luger says in one moment of weakness, &quot;I don't want to 
   die!&quot;). Some scenes reminded me of porn films, such as the stage 
   show at Cafe Death, which looks like a twisted take-off of <B><A HREF="cafe_flesh_1982.htm">CAFE
    FLESH</A></B> (1982). The jazz score, by Claude &quot;Coffee&quot;

   this type. <B><A HREF="dead_man_walking_1987c.htm">DEAD MAN WALKING</A></B>

    The Black Knights don't have enough business, they cause accidents

   respond to a new woman in their lives. It turns out to be totally

   becomes complicated when both The Black Knights and Becky's 
   grandparents turn up the heat (The Black Knights set fire to Steve's 
   motorcycle and the grandparents hire some thugs to kidnap Becky).

   must find a way to get Becky back, especially since Leslie turns into 
   the grandmother from Hell and refuses to let Steve see Becky (She 
   tells Becky, &quot;Your father doesn't love you anymore.&quot;). 
   Steve begins to unravel, so he decides to open his own towing company 
   with friend Pete (Ancel Cook). He builds his own indestructible tow 
   truck and soon becomes the premiere towing company in the area, 
   raking in the cash hand over fist. When Nelson learns he is dying of

   away from her grandparents) when he, Surf and Pool push the trailer 
   she's in over a cliff (the film's most effective scene), forcing 
   Steve and his tow truck to go on a ride of vengeance. This sets the 
   stage for a bloody showdown, where both the good and the bad get 
   ugly.&nbsp; A strange mixture of action and soap opera elements

   that was found in the beginning of the film, such as when Nelson and 
   Surf try to force severely injured accident victims to sign release 
   forms as they lay bleeding in their wrecked cars, but the film 
   quickly discards that quirkiness for more standard fare. As it 
   stands, this Philippines-lensed film passes muster (barely) thanks to 
   the energetic action scenes. The sci-fi aspects of Patrick 
   Edgeworth's screenplay are dropped very early on, so there's not much 
   on screen to make you believe this film takes place in the future. 
   Also starring James Brewer, Joey Aresco, Paul Holm and Nigel Hogge.

   warrior Michael (David Carradine), who wants William's head on a 
   stick for some past transgression. William sends his head goon, the 
   pith helmet-wearing Tomas (Nick Nicholson), on an advance mission to 
   a village known to contain plenty of water. The first thing Tomas 
   does when he reaches the village is kill the brother of village girl 
   Val (Jilliam McWhirter) to show he means business. Since the local 
   village men are too scared to take on Tomas and his small force of 
   men, who have taken over the village, Val escapes and begins a voyage 
   to search for some brave men to free her village from the tyranny. 
   Val runs smack-dab into a tribe of pygmie cannibals and is saved by 
   Michael, who drives her to Freetown, a village full of misfits and 
   mercenaries. After watching a motorcycle jousting tou<A HREF="dune_warriors_1990.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dune warriors vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>rnament

   (Rick Hill), Dorian (Blake Byod) and Ricardo (Dante Varona) to help 
   Val regain control of her village before William arives in one week's 
   time. Along the way, they also recruit shotgun-toting female warrior 
   Miranda (Isabel Lopez), who knows about Michael's past with William, 
   but William stops her from telling the others. Val and her five 
   warriors regain control of her village rather easily and begin 
   training the villagers, who are mainly farmers, how to fight in 
   preparation for William's arrival. Val's fiance, Luis (Henry 
   Strzalkowski), becomes jealous when Val shows an interest in Dorian, 
   so he turns traitorous and frees Tomas, who warns William what is 
   waiting for him in the village. William has a hard time believing 
   that only five people could defeat Tomas' squad, so he sends an 
   advance force to kill them, which fails terribly. William eventually 
   recaptures the village and takes Val and Dorian prisoner, but in an 
   incredible stroke of luck (some would say too incredible), John finds 
   a cache of weapons and explosives hidden in a cave. He arms all the 
   villagers and they assault the village, while Michael and William 
   settle an old score, having a swordfight with each other in the 
   middle of the raging battlefield. Just what was their beef anyway?

   is one non-stop action set-piece after another, with just enough 
   exposition to connect those scenes together. Santiago follows the 
   Roger Corman Principle (Corman financed many of Santiago's films, 
   including this one): Keep it short (this film is barely 77 minutes 
   long), keep it simple and give viewers what they expect, which is 
   explosions, gun battles, martial arts fights, gore and nudity (both 
   Jillian McWhirter and Isabel Lopez have topless scenes). Even David 
   Carradine, who was usually just slumming around in low-budget films 
   during this point in his career (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#KarateCop">KARATE
    COP</A></B> - 1991), looks to be having a good time here, playing an 
   &quot;old timer&quot; with an agenda.&nbsp; Most of the cast is made 
   up of Santiago regulars, including Rick Hill (<B><A HREF="action.htm#Devastator">THE

   film must have been like working with family and friends (Santiago's 
   son, Christopher, was in charge of the production and worked on many 
   of his father's films). There's not much meat to T.C. McKelvey's 
   (Santiago's <B><A HREF="action.htm#FieldOfFire">FIELD OF FIRE</A></B>

   flicks, <B><A HREF="dune_warriors_1990d.htm">DUNE WARRIORS</A></B> is 
   a pretty safe bet. The closing song that plays over the end credits

    as New Idaho looking for infected mutants to kill and non-infected 
   females to rape or get pregnant to propagate their species. A lone 
   female warrior named Danielle (Melanie Kilgour) teams up with escaped 
   military prisoner Orion (Thom Schioler) to look for Danielle's sister 
   Jasmine (Ann Louise Meyer), who has been kidnapped by Shepherd and 
   his gang. While Danielle is taking a topless shower in a cave, Orion 
   is knocked-out and kidnapped by some mutants (who look like the Sand 
   People in <B><A HREF="star_wars_1977.htm">STAR WARS</A></B>) and then 
   brought to their compound (an abandoned industrial park), where they 
   plan to drain and drink his blood and remove his bone marrow (the 
   mutants need the blood and marrow to combat their low white blood 
   cell count). Meanwhile, Shepherd and his warriors attack a human 
   settlement (actually an auto junkyard), where they kill all the men 
   and capture all the women (half of Shepherd's warriors are lesbians 
   dressed in black leather outfits). Danielle sneaks into the mutants' 
   compound and saves Orion's ass (he makes love to her as a way of 
   saying &quot;Thanks!&quot;). Orion enlists the aide of his father's 
   old army buddies, Iodine (James Stevens) and Chuck (Sandy MacKenzie), 
   to help them raid Shepherd's camp and rescue Jasmine. With a 
   cheapjack version of The Doors' &quot;Born To Be Wild&quot; playing 
   on the soundtrack, the quartet enter the camp, kill Shepherd and his 
   followers, save Jasmine and drive off into the sunset (The closing 
   tune on the soundtrack sounds too much like The Rolling Stones'

   As I have stated previously, <B><A HREF="empire_of_ash_2_1988b.htm">EMPIRE
    OF ASH (II)</A></B> is a cheap, cheesy flick with very little going 
   in its favor except for some unintentional humor (when a mutant drops 
   an IV bag of blood in the mud and it breaks, he scoops up the muddy 
   blood and tries to put it back into the bag!) and lots of low-rent 
   chases and shootouts. Co-directors Lloyd A. Simandl (<B><A HREF="chained_heat_2_1993.htm">CHAINED
    HEAT 2</A></B> - 1993) and Michael Mazo (<B><A HREF="crackerjack_1994.htm">CRACKERJACK</A></B> 
   - 1994), who would both go on to co-direct an actual sequel to this, <B><A HREF="#LastOfTheWarriors">EMPIRE
    OF ASH III</A></B> (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="#LastOfTheWarriors">LAST OF 
   THE WARRIORS</A></B> - 1989), try their best with the screenplay 
   supplied by John Ogis, but the fact is the scope of the script far 
   surpasses what this film's paltry budget will allow. There are simply 
   too many characters to keep track of here and the film seems more 
   like a series of vignettes than an actual linear story. While the 
   acting is generally weak across the board, Simandl and Mazo at least 
   have the good sense to let the pretty females do some nude scenes and 
   spice-up the film with some blood and gore (bloody bullet squibs; 
   dismembered body parts), including the killing of children. Alas, the 
   action scenes have a substandard look to them, as the camera 
   placements are off and the blocking of the fight scenes are lousy. 
   Still, there are a few good tries and in-jokes, such as Iodine &amp; 
   Chuck's firefight with some warriors that is staged like a videogame, 
   or Iodine throwing darts at a Jane Fonda magazine cover. It's not 
   nearly enough to overcome the general cheapness of the entire 
   production, though. The film is so threadbare, I'm surprised anyone 
   is wearing clothes. Also starring Misha Lachat, Eric Horsfall, 
   Michael Bernardo and David Gregg as &quot;Rocket Man&quot;, who fires 
   rockets from a helmet he wears on his head. Originally released on

   (1983) -</B> Out of the numerous post-apocalyptic thrillers to come 
   out of Italy during the 80's, this is my absolute favorite. The 
   beginning of this film is similar to Steven King's story <B><A HREF="running_man_1987.htm">THE
    RUNNING MAN</A></B>, written around the same time this film was 
   being produced and was turned into a film in 1987 with the same name 
   starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Bronx has been turned into a 
   radioactive cesspool in the year 2025 and one of the very few 
   distractions the people have is a reality show called Endgame, where 
   three &quot;hunters&quot; try to kill the &quot;prey&quot;, the 
   winner getting fabulous prizes (including a lifetime supply of 
   LifePlus, an energy drink that tastes like shit). On this, the 25th 
   episode of Endgame, the prey is former hunter Ron Shannon (Al Cliver) 
   and he is being stalked by three of the game's best hunters, 
   including personal enemy Kurt Karnak (big George Eastman, who wrote 
   the script as &quot;Alex Carver&quot;). It seems that this episode of 
   Endgame is serving a dual purpose as, while everyone in the city is 
   glued to their sets watching the show, the SS-like government, headed 
   by Col. Morgan (Gordon Mitchell), is systematically wiping out all 
   the Mutants, fearing that their superior powers (including telepathy 
   and the ability to read <A HREF="endgame_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/endgame vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>people's
    minds) will lead to the government's downfall. During the middle of 
   the game, Shannon is contacted by telepathic mutant Lilith (Moira 
   Chen, a.k.a. &quot;Laura Gemser&quot;) and is asked to escort her and 
   some fellow mutants out of the city where they will be safe. 
   Shannon's pay will be a fortune in gold. Shannon kills the first two 
   hunters and defeats Karnak (with Lilith's help), but spares his life. 
   He then runs afoul of the government when he saves Lilith from some 
   government goons. Shannon agrees to lead the Mutants out of the city 
   and hires Ninja (Al Yamanouchi), a (what else?) martial arts expert 
   and Kovack (Mario Pedone), a brute man, to come along as extra 
   muscle. After a brief run-in with Col. Morgan, where Karnak saves 
   Shannon's life (now they're even), Shannon starts leading the Mutants 
   out of the city, with Karnak not far behind. It's a long and deadly 
   trip and not everyone will survive. Expect to be entertained and 
   pleasantly surprised along the way.&nbsp; Much more literate and 
   creative than most Italian post-nuke films, director Joe D'Amato (he 
   uses the pseudonym &quot;Steven Benson&quot; here) anticipates 
   reality television over 15 years before it would become commonplace 
   and tosses in some pretty good set pieces to boot, including 
   telepathy used to defeat enemies remotely (as Lilith does in helping 
   Shannon Defeat Karnak in Endgame) and when they run into a town full 
   of psychopathic blind monks (who are also being controlled by an 
   enslaved telepathic mutant). That's not to say that <B><A HREF="endgame_1983b.htm">ENDGAME</A></B> 
   skimps on the action or violence, though. Heads are split open with 
   axes and run over by cars, there are numerous car and motorcycle 
   stunts and chases, stabbings, impalements, explosions, bullet squibs, 
   a nasty neck-twisting and dismemberments, not to mention acts of 
   self-sacrifice you don't normally see on films of this type. The real 
   surprise is Karnak's turnaround from bad to good guy. Or is he? You 
   are never sure until the finale (which is a hoot). There's also a 
   heartbreaking scene where Shannon and Lilith are speaking to each 
   other telepathically while she is being raped, only she talks to 
   Shannon as if nothing is going on because she does not want him to 
   know. Another unusual scene for a film of this type. On the minus 
   side, some of the Mutant makeups are shoddy (some of the members of a 
   renegade motorcycle gang look like outcasts from <B><A HREF="planet_of_the_apes_1968.htm">PLANET
    OF THE APES</A></B>) and, as usual, the dubbing is horrendous with 
   lines like, &quot;Look at me while I rape you, damn it!&quot; 
   littering the script. Don't let that deter you from watching this, 
   though (the late Joe D'Amato has said in several interviews that this 
   was his favorite film), because it really does have much more to say 
   than most Pastaland flicks. Future director Michele Soavi (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Church1989">THE
    CHURCH</A></B> - 1989) was one of the assistant directors here 
   (using the name &quot;Mike Soft&quot;) and has a cameo at the end as 
   a helicopter pilot. D'Amato, better known for his horror films like <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BeyondTheDarkness79">BURIED

   have melted and most of the potable water has disappeared. The Earth 
   is nothing but a scorched shell and the remaining humans are ruled by 
   a brutal dictatorship known as The Ownership, whose main base sits on 
   top of the Alaskan oil pipeline. Those who control the oil controls 
   the world. A faction of the rebel forces, who are fighting for a 
   supply of oil, capture Ownership member Captain Slade (Richard 
   Norton) during a battle and hope to use him in a prisoner exchange, 
   but he escapes. Meanwhile, a sexy, leather-clad woman named Karen 
   (Corrine Wahl) rips-off a group of black marketeers (who dress like 
   Southern rebels during the Civil War), led by Alamo (Henry 
   Strzalkowski) and Deke (Robert Patrick), and takes off with a few 
   crates of their explosives (this was supposed to be a 
   gas-for-explosives trade, but when the goofballs put the moves on 
   Karen, all deals are off). This leads to a <B><A HREF="road_warrior_1982.htm">ROAD

   while The Ownership recruits Alamo and Deke's gang to look for Slade. 
   Dixon (Rex Cutter), the leader of Karen's village, has developed a 
   multi-barreled handheld weapon called the Equalizer 2000, capable of 
   firing bullets, shotgun shells, grenades and rockets. Slade <A HREF="equalizer_2000_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/equalizer 2000 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="153" HEIGHT="251" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>helps
    refine the weapon in hopes of using it against Colonel Lawton 
   (William Steis), a sadistic Ownership member and former friend of 
   Slade's who has become power-hungry. Lawton and his men travel the 
   barren landscape, killing anyone who don't agree with The Ownership 
   rules. Lawton eventually makes it to Karen's village and a huge 
   firefight breaks out, but Slade and the Equalizer 2000 manage to hold 
   Lawton back until the villagers escape to safety. Once Lawton sees 
   the new weapon, he must have it, so he orders his men to get it any 
   way they can. Alamo and Deke manage to steal the weapon, kidnap Karen 
   and break off from The Ownership. Deke betrays Alamo (never trust a 
   black marketeer) and takes off with the weapon, giving it to Lawton 
   (and paying for it with his life). Lawton uses the Equalizer 2000 to 
   take control of The Ownership and the finale finds Karen's village 
   joining Slade and the rebels in storming The Ownership's 
   headquarters. After the good guys win, Slade destroys the Equalizer 
   2000, so no one else is tempted to take over the world. Everyone else

    This film lacks the playfulness of Luigi Cozzi's film, as well as 
   it's cheezy stop-motion animation, rather relying on space science 
   mumbo-jumbo (&quot;Fire up the irridium laser rays!&quot;) and 
   bottom-of-the-barrel special effects (including reversing footage 
   that shows Lithan jumping a high distance). The only things this has 
   in common with <B><A HREF="star_crash_1978.htm">STARCRASH</A></B> are 
   the costumes and the sexy outfits Cheryl Buchanan wears, showing off 
   her best &quot;assets&quot;. Otherwise, this is an excruciating bore 
   that offers nothing in the way of entertainment value. Director/co-screenwriter
    Bitto Albertini (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#HumanCobras1971">HUMAN

    KING OF THE JUNGLE</A></B> - 1972), here using the pseudonym 
   &quot;Ben Norman&quot;, has no idea what makes a science fiction film 
   work, even going as far as to have one race of aliens dress as if 
   they were ancient Romans, using costumes probably left over from some 
   Italian peplum flick. To keep costs down, this race of aliens don't 
   have bow and arrows or spears, they just throw rocks! This film's 
   idea of &quot;comedy&quot; is Belle &amp; Lithan mimicking an alien 
   couple who are kissing, because Belle &amp; Lithan's race don't touch 
   each other to show love. As a matter of fact, for the last 45 minutes 
   of the film, it turns into a softcore sex flick, more interested in 
   showing Belle and Lithan's sexual awakening, as Lithan and a male 
   alien member get into a competition to be the first one to pop 
   Belle's cherry, but it is so sloppily done, it is not titillating at 
   all. The film's shooting title was <B><I>Giochi erotici nella terza galassia</I></B> 
   (&quot;Erotic Games In The Third Galaxy&quot;), but the only 
   eroticism you will experience would not shock a grade schooler. I'm 
   not sure if Albertini wanted to make a science fiction or sex film 
   (much in the same way as Alfonso Brescia's X-Rated <B><A HREF="beast_in_space_1978b.htm">THE
    BEAST IN SPACE</A></B> - 1980), but he failed on both counts. I 
   tried to find something positive to say about this film, but damned 
   if I could find it. It's not even worthwhile for an unintentional 
   laugh. Oh, and those Roman-dressing aliens? Turns out they are human 
   and the planet Belle and Lithan landed on was ancient Earth!</FONT></FONT><BR>

   This Italian/Spanish co-production is one of the worst <B>ROAD WARRIOR</B> 
   (1982) imitations that I have ever seen and I've seen plenty. In a 
   post-nuclear apocalypse world, the Earth is running dangerously low

   town of scientists experimenting in hydroponics sends a convoy of 
   tanker trucks out to a secret location where water is plentiful, but 
   on their way there they are attacked by the Exterminators, a band of 
   dirtbike and dune buggy-riding mutants led by Crazy Bull (Fred 
   Harris). The only survivor of the attack is ten year-old Tommy (Luca 
   Vententini) and he enlists the help Alien (Robert Jannucci), a loner 
   anti-hero (in the mold of you-know-who), to help him <A HREF="exterminators_of_the_year_3000_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/exterminators of the year 3000 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="134" HEIGHT="231" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>bring
    a tanker full of water back to his town. At first, Tommy get's on 
   Alien's nerves (he sure got on mine), but after a few close calls 
   together, they become to depend on each other and Alien becomes 
   somewhat of a father figure to Tommy (whose real father died at the 
   Exterminators' hands a short while ago). After Tommy has an accident, 
   Alien takes him to a mechanic named Papillon (Alan Collins) for 
   repairs (turns out Tommy has some bionic parts) and he gives Tommy an 
   upgrade. Alien meets old flame Trash (Alicia Moro) and Tommy tells 
   her the secret location of the water (he still, at this point, has 
   trust issues with Alien). Trash and Alien go to the site and find the 
   water, but must deal with some angry religious zealots who guard the 
   water and work their way around various booby traps (not to mention 
   being double-crossed by Trash) before making the long journey back to 
   Tommy's town. Expect lots of resistance from Crazy Bull and his gang 
   of Exterminators (who he keeps calling &quot;mother grabbers&quot; 
   and &quot;ball breakers&quot;) on the return trip. After an accident 
   depletes the supply of water, all hope is lost. Or is it? Hey Alien: 
   Are you crying or is it raining for the first time in over a hundred 
   years?&nbsp; Quite simply put, George Miller should have sued. Not 
   only are entire scenes copied from <B><A HREF="road_warrior_1982.htm">THE

   was tied between two motorcycles and his arm is torn off, but then it 
   turns out he has a bionic arm and he wasn't hurt. To add insult to 
   injury, Alien picks up the arm and duct tapes it to Tommy's shoulder 
   (!) until he can have it attached properly. Tommy also gets drunk on 
   beer at one point, proving that the Italians never heard of child 
   labor laws. The fact that it took three people to write the 
   threadbare script (including genre vet Dardano Sacchetti) and the 
   best they could come up with are lines like, &quot;A snake bite is

   I remember coming home late from a night of boozing sometime in the 
   early 80's and turning on the TV (to CBS TV's The Late Late Show) 
   just as this flick was starting. The mixture of rocket fuel in my 
   system and the eerie vibe this film possessed creeped me out at the 
   time and I never forgot the experience. Since I am a glutton for 
   punishment, I decided to watch this again over twenty five years 
   later, this time perfectly sober. Knowing full well that I would 
   probably be bitterly disappointed, I was pleasantly surprised when I 
   wasn't. The film starts off like a ufologist's version of <B><A HREF="blow_up_1966.htm">BLOW-UP</A></B> 
   (1966) where fashion photographer Peter Collins (Franco Garofalo) 
   notices something strange in the background of one of the photos he 
   has taken. He goes back to the location to investigate when he is 
   chased and captured by aliens and brought aboard their spacecraft, 
   where he is put on a table and probed. <A HREF="eyes_behind_the_stars_1977.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/eyes behind the stars vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="127" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Peter's
    model friend, Karen (Sherry Buchanan), goes to his studio and finds 
   the negative of the photo. She calls her friend Tony (Robert 
   Hoffman), a reporter for the Daily Herald, who comes over and takes 
   the negative with him. Right after Tony leaves, a blinding flash of 
   light engulfs the studio and all the photos disappear. Karen walks 
   out of the studio in a trance and disappears. The next day, the 
   police, headed by Inspector Grant (Martin Balsam, badly dubbed with 
   an English accent), find Peter and Karen's vehicles abandoned in a 
   park, a huge circular burn in the grass nearby. Tony begins an 
   investigation and finds out that an old man and his dog were blinded 
   that night a short distance away from the cars and that there were 
   multiple reports of UFO sightings that night. The old man dies soon 
   after (of radiation poisoning) and the military covers it up. Tony 
   become suspicious and consults a noted ufologist, who tells him that 
   UFOs are real and the military is aware and may be working in 
   conjunction with them for nefarious reasons. He gives Tony some top 
   secret documents and tells him to be careful.&nbsp; Soon, the aliens 
   and the military are trying to silence Tony and everyone Tony talks 
   to ends up dead or too scared to talk. Can Tony get the information 
   out to the public before the Men In Black (yes, they're here, but 
   they are called &quot;Silencers&quot;) and aliens shut Tony's trap 
   for good? Prepare yourself for a nihilistic ending.&nbsp; A mixture 
   of paranoia, deceit and uncertainty permeate every frame of this 
   film. The eerie electronic score, along with the use of fisheye 
   lenses, give the film an otherworldly quality that greatly enhances 
   the atmosphere. Director/screenwriter Roy Garrett (real name: Mario 
   Gariazzo), who also directed the abysmal <B><A HREF="#Brother Space">BROTHER
    FROM SPACE</A></B> (1984) and the even hoarier <B><A HREF="coming_of_aliens_1978.htm">THE
    COMING OF ALIENS</A></B> (1978), which both also deal with 
   extraterrestrial visitations, gives us a straight-up verbal history 
   of UFO cover-ups across the world, all wrapped up in this little 
   tale. He should know because during his opening directorial credit it 
   states that he's a member of the National Investigation Committee on 
   Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) and a field investigator for the Aerial 
   Phenomena Research Organization (APRO). I don't know if any of that 
   is true (Gariazzo died in 2002), but he sure does play everything 
   that goes on in this film very seriously. On the minus side, the 
   aliens are laughable. They're basically men in silver jumpsuits with 
   a huge visor to hide their faces. The dubbing is also atrocious. 
   Everyone speaks with a proper English accent even though it's 
   abundantly clear that this wasn't filmed in England (the steering 
   wheels on the cars are on the wrong side). <B><A HREF="eyes_behind_the_stars_1977b.htm">EYES

   This is another in a long line of Italian post-nuke films that 
   flooded the marketplace during the 80's. After stock shots of atomic 
   bomb explosions and volcano eruptions, a voice-over informs us that 
   the future world contains two societies: The wealthy minority who are 
   uncontaminated and the radiation-diseased majority. The wealthy amuse 
   themselves by playing &quot;The Hunt&quot;, a sick game where they 
   hunt infected humans for fun, profit and bragging rights. Future 
   hunters Erasmus (Harrison Muller of <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#She1983">SHE</A></B> 
   [1983]) and Edra (Marina Costa) are competitors in the latest hunt; 
   the prize being ownership of a white sniper rifle (One hunter says, 
   &quot;Whoever painted <A HREF="final_executioner_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/final executioner vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>it
    didn't know the color of bullshit!&quot;). Edra and her group 
   savagely gun down over 25 people while Erasmus takes a more hands-on 
   approach and kills six people with a samurai sword. Since Edra also 
   killed six people, she and Erasmus are tied in the competition. They 
   capture player Alan Tanner (William Mang) and decide to let him go 
   (after raping and killing his wife!), agreeing that whoever hunts him 
   down and kills him will win the game. After being shot by Edra and 
   presumed dead, Alan is rescued by old-timer ex-cop Sam (Woody 
   Strode). After repairing Sam's car, Alan and Sam stakeout a food 
   drop, where they witness gangs of infected people fight each other to 
   the death for tins of meat. We then find out that Alan had proof that 
   the Earth and it's people are no longer infected by radiation and he 
   was made &quot;target material&quot; by the wealthy minority, who 
   don't wish the world to know the truth. After Sam teaches Alan 
   fighting and survival techniques, Alan sets out to get revenge on 
   those who raped and killed his wife. It won't be that easy since 
   Erasmus and Edra still have a contest to win. Alan infiltrates the 
   Hunters' compound and begins killing everyone there one-by-one (he 
   even boobytraps a motorcycle so that when one female hunter tries to 
   get away on it, it explodes underneath her). In the finale, it's Alan 
   against Erasmus and Edra, where Alan gets an unexpected hand from 
   Sam, just when things look hopeless.&nbsp; This is a pretty weak 
   apocalyptic tale thanks to the almost non-existant blood and gore. <B><A HREF="final_executioner_1983b.htm">THE
    FINAL EXECUTIONER</A></B> is plenty violent, as people are shot, 
   stabbed, punched and blown up, but very little of it is bloody. The 
   action scenes are handled well, but there's an over-reliance of 
   slow-motion shots and nearly every death is handled this way. As with 
   many Italian films of this type, there's a brutal rape which leads to 
   the death of the woman being raped. This film is not without some 
   effective moments, though. The Hunters have this device they put on 
   their heads which allows their memories to be displayed on a TV 
   screen and everyone gathers around to watch them like it's a night 
   out at the movies. When one hunter puts the device on his head, it 
   plays back the brutal rape. Hunter Diana (Margi Newton) gets 
   turned-on from watching it and ends up screwing the guy projecting 
   the memory. One wishes that director Romolo Guerrieri (<B><A HREF="sweet_body_of_deborah_1968.htm">THE
    SWEET BODY OF DEBORAH</A></B> - 1968; <B><A HREF="covert_action_1978.htm">COVERT
    ACTION</A></B> - 1978) would have used more of these imaginative 
   moments instead of focusing much of the screen time on William Mang 
   as Alan. Mang has such an unexpressive face, it's hard to tell if 
   he's taking a shit or just pissed off at the world. Another Italian 
   post-nuke flick, <B><A HREF="#Endgame">ENDGAME</A></B> (1983), told

   (Dale &quot;Apollo&quot; Cook; <B><A HREF="action.htm#FistOfGlory">FIST

   bleak landscape, only to be recaptured by a band of roving nomads, 
   led by the dentally-challenged Mainframe (Gregg Douglass). Mainframe 
   snaps Lyssa's neck and has his men crucify Amp in the sand (Which 
   raises the question: How do the spikes driven through Amp's hands 
   hold him in the sand?), but an unexpected sandstorm offers Amp an 
   opportunity to escape. Amp stumbles through the desert until he is

   her village. The village leader (Mike Monty) doesn't approve of Amp's 
   presence (Amp is a fighter called a &quot;Spiker&quot;, who fights in 
   tournaments for food and water), so as soon as Amp's wounds are 
   healed, he leaves the village with an unwanted Wild in tow. It's a

    because a short time later, Mainframe's men invade her village 
   looking for Amp and murder everyone when they don't find him. Amp and 
   Wild travel from village to village, surviving on food and water Amp 
   wins in Spiker tournaments. Amp teaches Wild the finer points of 
   fighting so she can pull her own weight. After battling some mutant 
   sand lepers, Amp and Wild end up in the next settlement, where Amp is 
   reunited with old friend Scudder (Jim Gaines; <B><A HREF="action.htm#JungleRats">JUNGLE
    RATS</A></B> - 1987), an ex-Spiker who gave up fighting due to a 
   traumatic event in his past. Amp enters into a tournament where the 
   winner will fight the champion fighter, Mainframe, in the Spiker 
   Championship Tournament. Amp takes on a series of increasingly 
   difficult opponents and ends up the winner, but Mainframe's 
   second-in-command, Wires (Don Nakaya Neilsen), nearly wrecks Amp's 
   chances of getting even with Mainframe. The sand lepers kidnap our 
   heroic trio and Amp is forced to fight their best fighter to the 
   death. After Amp defeats the rotting-faced leper, the trio head to 
   the next village, where Amp faces Mainframe in a final battle to the 
   death.&nbsp; Though nothing but a series of increasingly complex 
   martial arts fights, <B>FIST OF STEEL</B> (also known as <B><A HREF="eternal_fist_1991.htm">ETERNAL
    FIST</A></B>) is an enjoyably goofy and bloody Filipino actioner. 
   Late director Teddy Page (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Blood Debts">BLOOD
    DEBTS</A></B> - 1983; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#WarWithoutEnd">WAR
    WITHOUT END</A></B> - 1986), using his &quot;Irving Johnson&quot; 
   pseudonym, and screenwriter Anthony Jesu have fashioned a fast-paced, 
   if derivative, post-apocalypse tale that's short on plot, but 
   contains more than enough bloody violence and even some comedy 
   (Filipino staple Nick Nicholson is a hoot as a pot-smoking fight 
   promoter) that fans of this genre should enjoy. There's nary a dull 
   moment here, as people are pummeled, beaten to a bloody pulp, 
   stabbed, shot with a crossbow, axed in the head or run-through with 
   spears. What you won't find here, which is highly unusual for a film 
   in this genre, is gunplay of any kind. Guns don't exist in this 
   universe, as everyone either carries spears, knives, crossbows or 
   other edged weapons. Mainframe and his men still drive around in dune 
   buggies and gas is mentioned as a highly sought-after commodity, but 
   there is not one mention of guns. I find that very refreshing, even 
   though I'm sure the only reason we don't see firepower of any kind 
   was strictly a cost-cutting measure on the production end. Bullet 
   squibs and blanks aren't cheap, you know. This film has several 
   &quot;What The Fuck?!?&quot; moments, including Mainframe's gleeful 
   killing of Scudder (Gregg Douglass clearly relishes his role, which 
   makes his limited screen time a treat for viewers) and Amp getting 
   drunk and coming-on to Wild by asking, &quot;I guess a blowjob is out 
   of the question?&quot; The fighting scenes are solidly filmed and 
   well choreographed and the acting by Cook (who made <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#BloodRing1991">BLOOD
    RING</A></B> with Page the same year), Khan and Gaines gets the job 
   done without being embarrassing, which is surprising, since Cook is 
   usually stiffer than a corpse in Winter in all the other films I have 
   seen him in (Try watching <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#AmericanKickboxer2">AMERICAN

   is Bert I. Gordon's best giant animal film, because the effects are 
   better (even when you take the obviously fake puppets heads out of 
   the equation), there are many different species of giant animals and 
   insects, there are some downright atmospheric scenes (The forced 
   perspective shots are a lot better than normal) and there's a 
   gruesomeness factor not seen in most films Rated PG. The film is 
   narrated by professional football player Morgan (Marjoe Gortner; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BobbieJoOutlaw">B</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BobbieJoOutlaw">OBBIE</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BobbieJoOutlaw"> 
   JO AND THE OUTLAW</A></B> - 1975), as his coach suggests that he and 
   a couple of his friends take a small vacation before the big game 
   (Professional football has changed a lot since 1976!). so Morgan's 
   friend Davis (Chuck Courtney) and P.R. man Brian (Jon Cypher; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Blade1972">BLADE</A></B> 
   - 1972), take a nice peaceful trip to a secluded island, but 
   something sticks in Morgan's&nbsp; mind that his father told him when 
   he was a child: &quot;Morgan, one of these days Earth will get even 
   with man for messing her up with his garbage, Just let man continue 
   to pollute the Earth the way he is and nature will rebel. It's going 
   to be one hell of a rebellion.&quot; Morgan, his friends and some 
   strangers are going to have a first-hand look at that rebellion 
   sooner than they think. The first thing Morgan and his two friends do 
   is ride horses while two hunting dogs chase a deer. Once to dogs 
   corner the doe, Morgan lets it go, but Davis wants to kill it, so he 
   heads out on horseback to go after it. All of a sudden the horse 
   bolts and Davis is thrown off while we hear a buzzing sound in the 
   air. Davis is then attacked by giant wasps (done with Gordon's usual 
   superimposition and practical effects) and when his friends hear 
   Davis' yells for help, they arrive too late. When Morgan turns over 
   his body, we see that Davis' face is grossly swollen (an effect that 
   could never be shown in a PG film today). While Brian stays with the 
   body, Morgan goes looking for some help and finds the Skinner Farm, 
   but when he knocks on the door, no one answers. He hears a noise 
   coming from a nearby shed, so he opens it and is attacked and nearly 
   pecked to death by giant chickens (the heads are obviously plastic 
   puppets) and barely makes it out of the shed alive. Then he meets 
   Mrs. Skinner (Ida Lupino; <B><A HREF="devils_rain_1975.htm">THE 
   DEVIL'S RAIN</A></B> - 1975), who begs Morgan to come into the house 
   to look at something. Morgan notices some rat holes in the walls and 
   Mrs. Skinner tells Morgan that there's a white goop that is somewhere 
   on the farm's ground. No animal will eat it unless it is mixed with 
   feed, but only the young grow to huge heights, the adults remain the 
   same, but the adults don't live too long, because in Mrs. Skinner's 
   words the young ones &quot;et them&quot;. She also says that the 
   white goop is &quot;the way it comes to us from the Lord&quot;: out 
   of a hole in the ground. Morgan notices a wasp on a jar marked with 
   &quot;F.O.T.G.&quot; and knows this is the substance that is causing 
   all the problems. Morgan and Brian take Davis' body back to the 
   mainland for burial (the only way to and from the island is by 
   ferry), while Mrs. Skinner is left by herself and has her hand 
   attacked and mutilated by some giant slug-like creatures (it's bloody 
   and pushes the PG boundary again). Mr. Skinner (John McLiam) comes 
   back from the mainland after making a deal with some company about 
   selling the white goop. He hopes it will solve the world hunger 
   problem. He drives his VW Beetle on the road back to his farm when he 
   gets a flat tire. He goes out to change it when he notices a pack of 
   giant rats heading his way. He jumps in his car and locks all the 
   doors, but it is little help as the rats (or rather rat puppet heads, 
   which this time are rather good) break the car's windows and make a 
   meal out of Mr. Skinner (another very bloody scene). At Davis' 
   autopsy, the coroner states that Davis died from no less than 250 
   wasp stings, so Morgan and Brian head back to the island to warn Mrs. 
   Skinner, while the callous company representative that Mr. Skinner 
   hired to handle the sale of the goop, Mr. Bensington (Ralph Meeker; <B><A HREF="#WithoutWarning1979">WITHOUT
    WARNING</A></B> - 1979) and his disgusted assistant, Lorna (Pamela 
   Franklin; <B><A HREF="legend_of_hell_house_1973.htm">THE LEGEND OF 
   HELL HOUSE</A></B> - 1973) arrive at the Skinner Farm, not even 
   bothering to stop and help Tom (Tom Stovall) and his very pregnant 
   wife Rita (Belinda Balaski; <B><A HREF="piranha_1977.htm">PIRANHA</A></B> 
   - 1977) get their RV out of the mud they are stuck in and never see 
   Mr. Skinner's totally wrecked Beetle. Yes, Bensington is a real 
   bastard and it begins to worry Mrs. Skinner, who is afraid that he 
   will takes all of their goop and leave her with nothing (which he 
   would have done if not for the interference of Lorna, who has a 
   conscience and knows how Bensington works). Morgan and Brian just 
   arrive in the nick of time and skeet shoot some giant wasps as they 
   begin to attack Bensington, but, being the heartless bastard that he 
   is, he doesn't even say thanks, rather telling them that he owns the 
   goop lock, stock and barrel. Morgan and Brian find the giant wasps' 
   nest and blow it up with a homemade bomb. Lorna falls down a giant 
   rat hole and Morgan goes in to fetch her, but a cave-in force them to 
   look for another way to escape, which they do with the help of Morgan 
   and Brian's shotguns (Rats are shot in slow motion with red 
   paintballs, and any one who has been shot in an unprotected area with 
   a paintball knows how much it hurts, so I am sure some rats were 
   killed in this film). After Brian saves their skins, they discover 
   Bensington filling his Caddy's trunk up with jars of the goop and 
   plans to drive through the rats with his car. Morgan and Brian take 
   the Jeep out to see how many rats they are dealing with (Driving a 
   Jeep with no roof? Good luck Sherlock!) and discover hundreds of rats 
   and the RV is swarming with them (Luckily, Tom and Rita have made it 
   to the Skinner Farm). Morgan seems to have a<A HREF="food_of_the_gods_1976_frogs_1972_blu-ray.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/food of the gods-frogs blu-ray8a front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="261" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   plan: Rodeo the rats into the lake by electrifying the fence with a 
   portable generator and hoping the rats will drown (Brian says, 
   &quot;Rats can swim! Have you ever seen a hippo sink to the 
   bottom?&quot;). It works for a moment, but the rats disable the 
   generator. Of course, as soon as Brian says that, he is devoured by 
   some pissed-off giant rats (another very bloody scene). When Morgan 
   makes it back to the farm, he destroys all the goop in the Caddy's 
   trunk, while Bensington is eaten by the rats (Hooray!). Everyone else 
   fortifies the inside of the farm as the rats attack (some of the rat 
   shooting, done in slow-motion with the rats squealing, and the rat 
   attacks are very well done) and notice there is a giant white rat 
   outside that seems to be the leader. Morgan makes some pipe bombs and 
   some molotov cocktails to take out the rats and blow up the local 
   dam, which will flood the whole area (unfortunately, Mrs. Skinner is 
   eaten by some rats while Morgan is driving to the dam). Rita also 
   decides that this is the perfect time to have her baby, which turns 
   out to be a boy (I hope she doesn't call him Willard or Ben). Morgan 
   blows up the dam and the water begins to flow, as Morgan races back 
   to the farm (The effects of the water escaping from the dam is the 
   worst special effect in the film, all of which were done by Bert I. 
   Gordon himself). Morgan and the rest of the survivors run upstairs to 
   an alcove on the roof, while they watch all the rats drown (this is a 
   pretty effective and well-done shot). The white rat makes a surprise 
   appearance on the roof, but Morgan beats it to death with the butt of 
   his shotgun. Once the water recedes, Morgan and Tom put all the dead 
   rats in piles and burn them and hope the nightmare is over. The next 
   winter, we see two jars of goop floating down a river where dairy 
   cows are feeding. We then watch the cows being milked and then see a 
   schoolgirl drinking a small carton of milk as the end credits rolls 
   (Remember, the goop only affects the young). I have the feeling that 
   the nightmare is just beginning.&nbsp; Say what you want about Bert 
   I. Gordon, but he does seem to get a cast of pros to act in his 
   films, no matter how silly they seem. I have always liked this film 
   and own both the <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Vestron Video">Vestron

   - 1972; a film which takes the same conceit, but applies it to 
   normal-sized animals and insects). The print is flawless and it even 
   has a commentary by Mr. B.I.G. himself (ported over from the MGM 
   DVD), a new interview with Belinda Balaski and the original 
   theatrical trailer.. To me, he has been a legend since the 1950's and 
   that's a long time to be in the business. The fact that people are 
   still interested in his films (either as drunk Friday night viewings 
   or serious film watching) speaks volumes about his popularity. At 
   least one of his films played each week during the 70's, back when 
   watching these old films was considered a privilege, not something 
   for instant gratification. Still, it's nice to see his films get the 
   Blu-Ray treatment. Now, if only Susan Hart will loosen her 
   pursestrings! Followed by an unrelated Canadian tax shelter film

    also created a creature called &quot;Subject 20&quot;, a metamorph 
   that is constantly changing its genetic makeup to adapt to its 
   surroundings. It seems Subject 20 broke free and slaughtered a bunch 
   of lab animals and when it stopped its killing spree, it put itself 
   in a large incubator, where it now rests in a cocooned state. Mike 
   wants to kill it immediately, by Dr. Hauser and Dr. Cal Timbergen 
   (Fox Harris) talk him out of it by convincing him that by studying 
   the creature, they could open up new discoveries in rapid genetic 
   changes (Imagine turning a single grain of rice into something big 
   enough to feed a large family). Well, that turns out to be a big 
   mistake, as Subject 20 springs back to life and attaches itself to 
   the face (Hey, where have I seen this before?) of lab technician 
   Jimmy (Michael Bowen), where it gestates inside his body before 
   hatching into a totally new creature which begins hunting down and 
   devouring the laboratory staff, beginning with Earl (Scott Paulin). 
   The more the creature (which now looks much more like the <B>ALIEN</B>)

   off-balance and the gore flowing at a steady pace. The acting is 
   uniformly flat (especially Jesse Vint, who looks bored throughout,

   - 1988), are secretly taking over all the crime enterprises in the 
   big city, either by killing the competition (one guy gets crushed in 
   a car in an auto junkyard) or by joining forces with their biggest 
   competitor, Grimes (Patrick Culliton), who may or may not be a priest 
   (he wears a priest's collar during most of his screen time). Since 
   Adams also owns C.O.P.S., he puts a bounty on the head of T.V. news 
   reporter Marion Sims (Anna Rapagna), who has a videotape that shows 
   Adams participating in illegal activities. Tucker picks up Marion to 
   collect the bounty, but he slowly becomes disillusioned when rival 
   C.O.P.S. personnel try to kill him and Marion before he can bring her 
   in. The rest of the film details Tucker and Marion's misadventures, 
   as both rival C.O.P.S. and street thugs, all on Adams' payroll, try 
   to kill the duo. When Tucker isn't killing people with his 
   six-shooter, he's killing people with his power glove, which not only 
   shoots deadly electric bolts, it also gives Tucker superhuman 
   strength, such as the ability to tear doors off their hinges and stop 
   cars dead in their tracks. After Adams puts a $100,000 bounty on 
   Tucker's head for murder, the entire C.O.P.S. force, both those on 
   Adams' payroll or not, hunt down Tucker and Marion for a huge payout. 
   This leads to plenty of gunfights, car chases and fistfights, as 
   Tucker and Marion are helped by C.O.P.S. agent Roxanne (Dawn 
   Wildsmith; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#PhantomEmpire1987">THE PHANTOM EMPIRE</A></B> 
   - 1987), who gets her throat cut by Becker when he discovers her 
   treachery. The finale finds Tucker taking-on Becker one-on-one in the 
   auto junkyard (with an assist from the remote-controlled power 
   glove), while a mortally wounded Billy turns the tables on Adams, 
   putting a bounty on his head and ending up riddled with bullets by 
   his own greedy C.O.P.S., proving you get what you pay for.&nbsp; By 
   no means a good film by any stretch of the imagination, <B><A HREF="future_force_1989b.htm">FUTURE

   and William Zipp's wild overacting (I never thought I would be saying 
   that about Zipp, who is usually stiff as a piece of cardboard) carry 
   this film, as do the laughable special effects, especially the scene 
   where Tucker uses the power glove's remote control to beat the crap 
   out of and then strangle Becker. But Becker is a tough nut to crack, 
   as the &quot;surprise&quot; finale shows. If you don't mind the 
   overall starvation of the budget (this is the type of film where,

   throw-off sparks rather than breaking the glass), you'll probably

    He found a benefactor in United Arab Emerites' Sultan Saeed Al 
   Darmaki, who was Executive Producer on such films as <B><A HREF="zombie_hunter_2013.htm">ZOMBIE
    HUNTER</A></B> (2013) and <B><A HREF="lord_of_tears_2013.htm">LORD 
   OF TEARS</A></B> (2013). This is the result. On June 25, 1982 (the 
   date Carpenter's film opened in theaters), a Soviet spacecraft 
   crashes into the Arctic ice; the cause of the crash looks like some 
   red gooey alien organism. We then cut to the present in Dutch Harbor, 
   Alaska, where a group of scientists board a crabbing ship named the 
   Harbinger to follow a pod of whales that they have tagged with GPS 
   chips. One of the scientists is Sadie (Camille Balsamo), who is a 
   close personal friend of the Harbinger's Captain Graff (Lance 
   Henriksen). She informs Graff that her team is following a pod of 
   Beluga whales to determine what they do in the chilly Arctic waters 
   and they brought all the fancy electronic gadgetry to follow them. 
   Graff agrees to let the group follow the whales during the day, as 
   long as he and his crew can crab at night. Sadie notices a large blip 
   on her tracking screen and it is not a whale, so Graff and his crew 
   snag it in their nets. They discover that it is the frozen wreckage 
   of the Soviet spacecraft complete with the frozen remains of a Soviet 
   cosmonaut. It is also reasonable to assume that something alien has 
   infected the remains. Stephen (Matt Winston), who is the head 
   scientist of the group, claims the spacecraft as the property of the 
   university who funded this expedition. Over Stephen's objections, 
   Graff informs him that it is the property of the Harbinger and orders 
   his crew to quarantine the ship in the hold and let it thaw out (a 
   bad idea). I think you can guess where the film is headed. Sadie 
   breaks protocol and takes a sample of the cosmonaut's flesh. She 
   discovers that the flesh is infected with an extremely rare species 
   called the &quot;water bear&quot;, only it is different in some way. 
   It seems to be growing larger. Stephen threatens to sue and bankrupt 
   Graff for allowing Sadie to expose everyone to a possibly deadly 
   pandemic unless Sadie signs a release allowing the university to 
   claim the spacecraft and everything inside it. Before Sadie can sign 
   the release, the cosmonaut's body disappears and a creature kills one 
   of Graff's crew. Stephen then begins to act strangely and three 
   arm-like appendages burst out of his back (the film's best scene), 
   killing him (everyone watches as the alien goo joins together and 
   exits down a drain). We finally get a good look at one of the 
   creature's forms, as it can change from solid to a liquid in the 
   blink of an eye. It kills crew member Atka (Edwin H. Bravo) by 
   shooting tentacles at him, impaling and infecting his body (Earlier 
   in the film, they decide to use liquid nitrogen to kill the creature 
   and when Graff&nbsp; sees crew member Sergei [Executive Producer 
   Jason Speer] carrying a bucket of liquid nitrogen, he says, 
   &quot;You're gonna need a bigger bucket!&quot;). The alien organism 
   disables the ship by bending the driveshaft and complicating matters 
   is when crew member Svet (Milla Bjorn) is exposed as a Russian agent. 
   She was put on the ship to destroy the alien organism and has planted 
   explosive charges on the ship that, in 60 minutes, will scuttle the 
   ship and sink it into the icy waters, disabling the organism while 
   she catches a Russian submarine sent to pick her up.&nbsp; (This 
   brings up the big questions: How did the Russians even know that 
   there was an alien organism and how did they know that this would be 
   the time to find the spacecraft?). Svet presses a button that will 
   detonate the charges in 60 minutes, but she never catches that 
   submarine, as the alien organism has her for chow.&nbsp; Now Graff 
   and the remaining people on the ship must try to find and disable the 
   explosive charges before the hour is up. They must also try to steer 
   clear of the alien organism, that is growing bigger the more it eats 
   (It has devoured two tons of crab in storage). Will anyone survive or 
   will the alien organism infect the entire planet?&nbsp; Although the 
   creature physical effects are quite good, the plot is unfortunately 
   too familiar. The acting ranges from professional (Henriksen) to rank 
   amateur (Reid Collums, who plays crew member 'Bowman&quot;), but if 
   you want to see plenty of deadly alien creatures made the 
   old-fashioned way before there was such a thing as CGI, this film 
   will probably do the trick, It's only 82 minutes long, so it doesn't 
   overstay its welcome. For a film made out of pure revenge, it's not 
   that bad even if you have seen it all before. I had fun spotting all 
   the little tributes sprinkled throughout the film as homage to 
   Carpenter's classic. It is clear that Alec Gillis was a big fan of 
   that film. Also starring Winston James Francis, Giovonnie 
   Samuels,&nbsp; Michael Estime and Mick Ignis as the creature. A

   of those futuristic &quot;Earth In Peril&quot; films that the 
   Italians did so well in the 80's. This is one of the later ones. In 
   the near future (actually 1997!), Earth is being ravaged by 
   radiation, toxic gases and acid rain, causing the population to 
   become diseased and sickly. The blind wheelchair-bound Reverend 
   Arthur Mosely (Franco Fantasia) is one man who may have a solution to 
   reversing Earth's problems, but almost never gets the chance as a 
   cyborg named Paco (Daniel Greene), is sent to kill him in his hotel 
   room, but <A HREF="hands_of_steel_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hands of steel vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="264" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>stops
    short of doing so, the human side of him overtaking his mechanical 
   side. The corporation that sent Paco out on his mission, led by the 
   nefarious Francis Turner (John Saxon), must now hunt down and kill 
   Paco before he is captured by the police and they discover Turner's 
   plan of exploiting Earth's problems for his greedy gains. On his 
   travels to escape, Paco meets many people that change him from cyborg 
   to human, finally fighting on the side of right to battle the corrupt 
   Turner and his corporation goons. His first stop is at a diner/motel 
   where he meets owner Linda (Janet Agren), who gives Paco a job 
   chopping wood and cleaning up the place. When truck driver/arm 
   wrestler Raoul (George Eastman) arrives at the diner, he challenges 
   Paco to an arm wrestling contest, which Paco at first declines. After 
   some taunting (&quot;He's as strong as a wet fart.&quot;), Paco 
   obliges and beats Raoul easily. He then beats Raoul and his trucker 
   buddies in a fist fight. Paco is then challenged by arm wrestling 
   champion Anatola Blanco (Darwyn Swalve) to a championship bout. Along 
   the way, Paco tries to save a carload of Native American kids trapped 
   in a car teetering on a cliff, only to find it was a trap set by 
   Raoul and his friends. They drag him from the back of a tow truck and 
   beat him with metal pipes, just hours before the championship match. 
   Paco frees himself and shows up for the match, where a deadly 
   rattlesnake will bite the loser. Paco easily wins the match, but 
   kills the rattlesnake before it can bite Blanco. Meanwhile, the 
   corporation strong-arms Professor Olster (Donald O'Brien), the man 
   who created Paco, to come up with a way to control him. When the 
   Professor give them some ideas, they shoot him dead. They send Peter 
   Hallo (Claudio Cassinelli), the world's best hitman, to track down 
   and kill Paco. Things come to a boil when Paco, who has fallen for 
   Linda (he shows her his mechanical hand and it does not bother her), 
   must deal with hitman Peter, corporation head Turner, a female hooker 
   cyborg (!) and countless faceless cronies in his quest for the world 
   to know the truth, and gets some unexpected help from Blanco. In an 
   unusual move for mindless action films like this, the final shot will 
   leave you pondering whether Paco is part-human after all and whether 
   machines can have souls. Directed by Sergio Martino (using his

   (1986) -</B> In this futuristic thriller that takes place in the year 
   1997, Dr. Charles Kesselman (Edward N. Fallon) has invented a new 
   energy source called Hellfire and the first energy plant to use the 
   new technology has just gone online, with equal amounts of fanfare 
   and protests. Even though Hellfire is supposed to be a clean, 
   non-polluting energy source, the protesters feel that it hasn't been 
   tested long enough to be put into everyday use (And, c'mon, why would 
   you give it the name &quot;Hellfire&quot; in the first place? It 
   doesn't inspire confidence!). Meanwhile, extremists have hijacked a 
   space freighter and accidentally crashed it on an asteroid where a 
   mining colony os digging up the main ingredient of Hellfire; the 
   crash causing a leak in the core. The extremists, Boyle (Steve 
   Langone) and Santhany (Susan Farrell), steal a vile of pure Hellfire 
   and escape, blowing up the mining colony and killing all its 
   employees as they leave. T<A HREF="hellfire_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hellfire british vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="338" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>his
    doesn't sit too well with Hellfire Energy Company president Olan 
   Robert Foster (Stephen Caldwell), who sends an assassin to kill Boyle 
   and Santhany (they are impaled by a sword while they are making love) 
   and retrieve the vial. We then switch over to private investigator 
   and amateur gambler Corby McHale (Kenneth McGregor) as he accepts a 
   job from pretty Caitlin Foster (Julie Miller), the sister of Olan 
   Robert Foster. She wants Corby to investigate her brother's 
   activities because she believes that he is responsible for her 
   fianc&eacute;'s death, as well as other murders. Corby, an ex-cop who 
   was kicked-ff the force, teams up with ex-partner and ex-lover 
   Samantha Keller (Sharon Mason) to uncover what secret Mr. Foster is 
   willing to kill for time and time again. What Corby discovers is that 
   Hellfire is not as safe as it is advertised. It begins infecting 
   those who come in close contact with it, eventually causing them to 
   spontaneously combust. Things start getting hairy when Corby and 
   Samantha are nearly blown up in their car by a couple of rocket 
   equipped flying drones and Mr. Foster burns to a crisp after 
   injecting himself with Hellfire. A battered and bruised Corby must 
   figure out who has enough juice to murder Mr. Foster (he didn't 
   intentionally inject himself with Hellfire), as all his friends and 
   contacts end up missing or dead. It turns out Corby didn't have to 
   look any further than his client, as Caitlin was working in cahoots 
   with Boyle (who was her fianc&eacute;) to steal the secrets of 
   Hellfire and somehow had those secrets injected into Corby's body. At 
   least I think that's the explanation, but the film is so badly 
   written, it is hard to be sure.&nbsp; This cheap and confusing piece 
   of no-budget cinema, directed and written by one-shot wonder William 
   Murray, is a loony mixture of detective and sci-fi genres with a 
   dollop of gore thrown in for good measure. The entire film has an 
   Andy Milligan-ish feel to it, as the actors are either really awful 
   or over-the-top (an example of the latter is Martin Hodge as Anton 
   Kirar, who, for some reason unknown to viewers, speaks all of his 
   dialogue with a thick Cockney accent, even though the film takes 
   place in Philadelphia and New Jersey!); the editing is downright 
   choppy (it looks like there was a lot of post-production tampering 
   that eliminated entire subplots); the special effects are laughable 
   (especially the spaceship effects, which look like someone was 
   holding the model ships just off-screen and moving them up and down 
   over a real sky while someone else blows smoke into the frame); and 
   the entire film looks to have been shot with handheld cameras using 
   short ends. Besides a couple of effective spontaneous combustion 
   scenes, <B><A HREF="hellfire_1986b.htm">HELLFIRE</A></B> (also known 
   as <B><A HREF="primal_scream_1986.htm">PRIMAL SCREAM</A></B>) is a 
   totally amateurish production that should only be viewed with the aid 
   of illegal substances or some cheap booze. The saxophone-heavy music 
   score (not to mention a cameo appearance by a punk band called the 
   &quot;Sadistic Exploits&quot;) will either have you jamming peanuts 
   in your ears or watching this film with the sound off. The closing 
   tune, an 80's love ballad titled &quot;In The Line Of Duty&quot;, 
   will make your ass bleed with its rank awfulness. Also starring Jon

   bottom-view shot of a large spaceship flying overhead. The evil Lord 
   Graal (Ivan Rassimov, made to look like Darth Vader's trailer-trash 
   cousin) has escaped from a prison planet and is looking to get even 
   with his Great Brother (Massimo Serato), who sent him to prison for 
   crimes against mankind. Before Lord Graal can get his revenge on his 
   brother on the planet Metropolis (the future name of Earth), he makes 
   a stop on another planet to visit ex-love Lady Agatha (Barbara Bach), 
   who is being kept eternally youthful by the dastardly Dr. Kraspin 
   (Arthur Kennedy), who drains the youth of other women to make the 
   serum (There's a surprising scene of female nudity showing the 
   process). Dr. Kraspin tells Lord Graal that he plans on creating an 
   &quot;army of humanoids&quot; to help him conquer Metropolis, but he 
   needs a test subject to create the first humanoid. His test subject 
   turns out to be a good space lawman named Golob (Richard Kiel). Dr.

   new regeneration serum created by Dr. Carradine (Tim Morgan), that is 
   supposed to reverse dead tissue, but it turns its subjects into 
   flesh-hungry zombies. When a small earthquake leaks the serum onto 
   two thousand cadavers Dr. Carradine was storing illegally outside, it 
   creates quite a zombie problem that Dr. Carradine and his associates 
   cover-up so they don't lose their government funding. When the zombie 
   horde devour Dr. Carradine and his team, they head for the wilderness 
   where, you guessed it, is the same place Paul, his girlfriend Lexa 
   (Marie-Eve Lemire), Sebastien (Luc Rivard), Francine (Valerie 
   Tremblay) and tracker Simon Roy (Patrick Baby) are about to go on 
   their hunting expedition. Sebastien is harboring a secret that could 
   put everyones' lives in jeopardy (his father is an important 
   government official) and Francine is under the impression that this 
   is just another virtual reality game (not only is she a stupid bitch, 
   when she finds out this trip is real, she pukes her guts out!), but 
   all that gets put on the back burner when the hunters suddenly become 
   the hunted. Instead of hunting helpless animals, Paul and his group 
   find themselves under siege from the hungry living dead. They are 
   helped by the sole survivor of Dr. Carradine's laboratory, female 
   military personnel Lt. Aria Palmer (Emilie Gilbert Gagnon), who 
   recognizes Simon Roy as a wanted criminal; a serial killer who brings 
   people on &quot;hunts&quot;, but no one ever returns alive. Simon 
   escapes into the forest and Sebastien dons a top-secret cybersuit 
   (that he was conveniently carrying) and when he gets bitten by the 
   zombies, he becomes an indestructable member of the undead, thanks to 
   the suit. When Sebastien's father (Louis Amiot) shows up with some 
   soldiers, it sets off a series of events, which finds Paul and Lexa, 
   the last remaining of the living, fighting for their lives against 
   cyber-Sebastien and the living dead. Mon deiu, how are they going to 
   get out of this mess?&nbsp; There are two major flaws to this film 
   (not to mention a bunch of minor ones), directed/produced/co-written 
   by Eric Bilodeau (his first feature film, which he also edited, 
   photographed and had a hand in the special effects), that really 
   detract the viewer's enjoyment. The first major flaw is that it is 
   apparent that English is most of this film's actors' second language 
   and they struggle with some of their English dialogue, sometimes even 
   reverting to their native French in the middle of a sentence. 
   Director Bilodeau (who co-wrote the screenplay with Jonathan Gagne) 
   should have filmed the entire movie in French (about 25% of the film 
   is subtitled in English anyway) because the acting suffers from the 
   poor line readings. The second major flaw, and it's a big one, is the 
   film's over-reliance on terrible CGI effects, including 
   computer-enhanced blood squibs and muzzle flashes. They are so 
   obvious, they take you immediately out of the film. I still don't 
   know why low-budget science fiction and horror films continuously go 
   this route, since none of it ever looks good, nevermind believable. I 
   can understand using CGI for difficult effects shots, but when it is 
   used in the place of practical effects, like shots to the head and 
   exploding bodies, it is unforgivable in my book (and I'm tired of 
   hearing all this crap of stopping valuable filming time to clean up 
   the blood, because this film takes place in the woods!). Even the 
   wilderness looks like it was created using Blender on a Mac! Ugh! 
   It's just pure laziness. Also starring Jean Francois Potvin-Tremblay, 
   Dave Harvey, Marie-Elaine Fortin and Francois Soucy. I dare anyone to 
   count how many times Eric Bilodeau's name appears in the closing 
   credits. It's easy to lay the blame of <B><A HREF="hunting_grounds_2008b.htm">HUNTING
    GROUNDS</A></B> shortcomings on his shoulders since his hands were 
   in nearly every piece of the pie. I don't believe this film has had 
   an official U.S. home video release (yet), but it can be purchased 
   from online stores that deal with DVDs fairly easily. <B>Not Rated</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

   actioner opens interestingly enough when cop Thomas Stanton (Richard 
   Norton; <B><A HREF="action.htm#SwordOfBushido">THE SWORD OF BUSHIDO</A></B> 
   - 1989) comes face-to-chest with a giant hulking psycho (played by 
   late wrestling legend Big John Studd; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Shock Em Dead">SHOCK
    'EM DEAD</A></B> - 1990) who is holding a decapitated human head in 
   one of his meaty hands (Stanton yells out, &quot;Hold it!...Release 
   the head!&quot; which the psycho does, throwing it at Stanton and 
   knocking him on his ass!). A fight breaks out between the two (the 
   terrified expression on Norton's face looks real because Studd towers 
   over him), which results in Stanton setting the psycho on fire and 
   killing him (Stanton goes to light up a cigarette after the brawl, 
   but can find no matches, so he looks at the psycho's burning corpse 
   and, for a split second, you think he's going do it, but he says to 
   himself, &quot;I gotta quit smoking&quot;). We are then informed (by 
   an on-screen scrawl) that by the 21st Century, the nuclear waste 
   problem became so severe, a worldwide corporation created a starship 
   to dispose of the radioactive waste in a distant region of the 
   universe known as &quot;Hyper Space&quot;. Then we are introduced to 
   the crew of the starship as they wake up from months of hyper-sleep. 
   The crew consists of ex-Ranger Stanton (it turns out his fight with 
   the psycho may have been nothing but a hyper-sleep nightmare); his 
   friend Tubbs (Ron O'Neal; <B><A HREF="action.htm#TrainedToKill1988">TRAINED

   - 1987); and Roberta &quot;Lobo&quot; Villalobos (newcomer Rebecca 
   Cruz, whose first scene in the film is a nude shower!). Arias, who 
   doesn't like to be touched, informs Stanton the ship's computer 
   system has gone bonkers and that they have lost all communication 
   with Earth. Is it possible that someone on board is a saboteur and if 
   there is one, what is their motive? It seems that while they were all 
   in hyper-sleep, the ship went off-course and with the computers not 
   working properly, they have no idea where they are. Captain Scully is 
   only interested in delivering the payload and going home, but Tubbs 
   informs everyone &quot;We are out of gas!&quot; and won't be able to 
   make it back to Earth. Stanton has another nightmare (this one not 
   hyper-sleep induced) where his Ranger partner Matt (stunt coordinator 
   Jeff Imada) is beheaded by an android (Professor Toru Tanaka; <B><A HREF="perfect_weapon_1991.htm">THE
    PERFECT WEAPON</A></B> - 1991) and he sustains a knife wound to the 
   shoulder (We now discover that neither of Stanton's nightmares were 
   nightmares after all, but recollections of his past life on Earth as 
   a Ranger). Arias comes up with a plan to send one, and only one, of 
   them back to Earth in a modified shuttlecraft. The trip will take 
   nearly three years, but it is their only chance for survival (all the 
   others will be stuck on the starship for 22 years). Since everyone 
   wants to be the one on that shuttlecraft, they draw straws and Tubbs 
   wins, which pisses-off Captain Scully to no end (others show the same 
   feelings as the film progresses). Stanton seems to be the only one 
   that is truly happy that Tubbs won the draw. When Tubbs is found 
   dead, the apparent victim of an alien creature he kept as a pet, 
   Stanton must use his cop training to figure out who really killed his 
   best friend, while the rest of the crew fight each other over who is 
   going to be the next shuttlecraft passenger. It's going to be 
   survival of the fittest.&nbsp; This is a talky sci-fi actioner 
   partially financed by executive producer K.Y. Lim and is Silver Star 
   Film Company, who also gave us so many of those Filipino war 
   actioners during the 80's that I am so fond of. Unfortunately, <B><A HREF="hyper_space_1989b.htm">HYPER
    SPACE</A></B> is nothing at all like those films, as it just 
   meanders along at a much too leisurely pace, interrupted every so 
   often by one of Stanton's violent flashbacks to when he was a Ranger. 
   Director David Huey (<B><A HREF="capital_punishment_1991.htm">CAPITAL PUNISHMENT</A></B> 
   - 1991; <B><A HREF="full_impact_1993.htm">FULL IMPACT</A></B> - 1993) 
   and screenwriter Richard Dominguez seem more interested in the 
   interpersonal relationships of the crew; whether it is Captain 
   Scully's drug habit; Arias' dislike of being touched (the secret she 
   is hiding is quite obvious; think <B><A HREF="alien_1979c.htm">ALIEN</A></B> 
   [1979]); why Stanton really quit the Rangers; Lobo's pre-occupation 
   with using her curvaceous body to get her way; or why Drezak is such 
   a violent prick. Since most of the characters are underwritten, which 
   is a shame considering the cast (only the late Ron O'Neal gets to 
   shine), it is really hard to give two shits about what happens to 
   them, especially when they violently turn on each other during the 
   final third of the film. Besides Lobo's nude scene and Tubb's gory 
   death, there's nothing here to hold your attention unless you are a 
   Richard Norton completist (I guess that is not such a bad thing).

   Van&quot; (a sight to behold), to rob a heavily guarded bank vault. 
   To the police (who lose quite a few men and women in the ensuing 
   firefight) and nosey reporter T.Q. Zhuang (Tony Leung; <B><A HREF="infernal_affairs_2002.htm">INFERNAL

   it steals the entire vault itself and flies away with it, but not 
   before informing the police that The Hero is going to take over the 
   entire city in one month's time. Back at home base, an angry Maria 
   asks her second-in-command, B12 (Lam Ching Ying; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#HerVengeance">HER
    VENGEANCE</A></B> - 1988) why The Van didn't kill all of the police 
   after stealing the vault, only to be informed that the robot's 
   computer malfunctioned and needs to be rebooted (My first IBM 
   computer in the 80's was always doing that to me, too!). When Maria 
   demands that it be fixed within 48 hours and is told that it is 
   impossible, she shoots one of the American scientists in the head to 
   make her point a little more clear (An American scientist working for 
   a crime syndicate in Hong Kong? Of course he's going to die!). During 
   a press conference with the police, T.Q. meets Curly (John Sham), a 
   scientist who is working with a team of scientists to create a 
   &quot;special weapon&quot; to fight The Van (During the testing of a 
   new gun, we watch as Curly's boss [Dennis Chan] uses him as a human 
   guinea pig to demonstrate the effectiveness of the armor-piercing 
   bullets). What the police don't know is that The Hero's head villain, 
   Saviour (Ben Lam; <B><A HREF="meltdown_1995.htm">MELTDOWN</A></B> - 
   1995), Maria's brother and lover (!), has created a human cyborg 
   called &quot;Van II&quot; that is much more mobile and easier to 
   manuever than The Van. Maria acts disappointed and jealous (since the 
   new cyborg has a kicking metal body of a well-endowed woman!) that 
   Saviour has hidden this creation from her until now. Curly is also 
   having some personal and professional problems because his boss has 
   burned his blueprints for a prototype Electric Cannon that he was 
   sure to defeat any robot that stands in its way (The boss is jealous 
   that Curly will take over his position if this weapon is created). 
   Curly saves the life of Chu (Tsui Hark; director of such films as <B><A HREF="were_going_to_eat_you_1980.htm">WE'RE

   &quot;Whiskey&quot; (because that is all he drinks), not knowing that 
   Whiskey is an ex-member of The Hero. When Maria finds out that Curly 
   is a member of the police task force, she automatically believes that 
   Whiskey is a traitor and orders a hit on him and Curly. Saviour sends 
   the Van II (who now has an incestuous facsimile of Maria's face) to 
   carry out the assassination, but the bumbling Curly and the drunk 
   Whiskey manage to defeat it (in an amazing display of pyrotechnics, 
   stunts and special effects), leaving the Van II in pieces. Whiskey 
   buries <A HREF="i_love_maria_roboforce_1988b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/roboforce dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="155" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>the
    pieces, since he and the real Maria were once very good friends. 
   Things get complicated when the police think Curly is a traitor 
   (thanks to his boss), leaving Curly and Whiskey in the middle of this 
   whole mess, trying to figure out a way to solve it. They hide out in 
   an old abandoned church working on a way to clear Curly's reputation 
   and find a way to defeat The Hero (as well as arguing with each other 
   the best way to kill a dog so they can eat it [don't worry, they 
   can't do it]). Curly digs up the remains of the Van II, reassembles 
   and reprograms it (he gets it to obey commands by saying, &quot;I 
   love Curly.&quot;) to fight The Hero. Good thing, too, because 
   Saviour has sent the original giant The Van and a pissed-off human 
   Maria to kill Whiskey and Curly, turning the remainder of the film 
   into a battle royale, the likes of which you wish Michael Bay would 
   have made in his <B><A HREF="transformers_2007.htm">TRANSFORMERS</A></B> 
   movie franchise. Luckily, Curly made some backup blueprints for his 
   Electronic Cannon (always, I mean always, back up your data!), 
   because it comes in mightily handy in the over-the-top finale. While 
   some may argue that this film contains too much broad humor, 
   especially between Whiskey and Curly, there can be no denying that <B><A HREF="i_love_maria_roboforce_1988b.htm">I
    LOVE MARIA</A></B> contains many kick-ass action set pieces, amazing 
   special effects and a fair amount of gore (but I get the impression 
   that the Fortune Star DVD I watched has edited some of the more 
   gorier bits and nudity). Director Chung Chi Man (a.k.a. &quot;David 
   Chung&quot;; <B><A HREF="magnificent_warriors_1987.htm">MAGNIFICENT WARRIORS</A></B> 
   - 1987) and screenwriter Yuen Kai Chi (<B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#SeventhCurse1986">THE

   bunch of bad guys as they all swing on vines in the jungle), but 
   still make this film a very unique viewing experience. Since all the 
   special effects are practical and free of CGI, the action sequences 
   seem more natural and organic, even the robotics (if that makes any 
   sense). If you can forgive some of the juvenile humor (although some 
   of it is quite funny) and the simply awful English subtitles (no one

    average science fiction tale, greatly enhanced by terrific special 
   effects (courtesy of director Philip J. Cook) and a quirky sense of

   Disaster (Hans Bachmann) accidently uncovers an alien plot to take

   some Army personnel. It seems a couple of years ago the government

   computer system (called ASMODS, pronounced &quot;asmodeus&quot;). 
   They were able to use the obtained information to develop new 
   technology for fighter jets and defense systems. The bad news is that 
   this new technology has a mind of its' own, overwriting existing 
   programs and eventually taking over the minds of the personnel of an 
   Army base, turning them into zombie-like minions who obey ASMODS' 
   every command. The reporter joins forces with a Departmant of Defense 
   agent (A. Thomas Smith) in notifying Washington of the impending 
   doom. ASMODS takes the shape of a high-tech flying saucer and dogs 
   our two heroes' every move. In the end we find out that the saucer is 
   only a component to a greater machine (the saucer is the brain). Our 
   heroes, along with an Army general, also discover that the saucer is 
   the machine's Achille's heel and try to find a way to destroy it 
   before the world is destroyed in a hail of nuclear missiles. While 
   indifferently acted by a cast of unknowns, this film has some 
   knock-out model effects and stop motion animation. The saucer, 
   elevator and jet fighter sequences are some of the best you'll ever 
   see in a low budget film. There is also plenty of humor, as when 
   Bachmann (who really wants to be a serious journalist) must interview 
   loonies for outrageous stories his ragazines carries, such as a 
   couple with a two-headed dog or the taxi driver who said Elvis got 
   into his cab last week and wanted to give him a handjob. The funniest 
   bit of dialogue comes at the end, when the giant robot ASMODS 
   delivers a patriotic monologue that must be heard to be believed! 
   Special effects veteran Cook turns in a good directorial effort here 
   (his first). Finally, something good from 21ST Century Film Corp.!

   her, depending on your state of mind), gets tied spread-eagle to a 
   bed and has as eel enter her vagina, turning her into an 
   indestructable killing machine. She sets out on her search for the 
   great-granddaughter (Claudia Rademaker), castrating some local males 
   and killing nearly every cop in town in the process. An American cop 
   (Christopher Hart) is Rademaker's only protection, as he tries to 
   keep one step ahead of the reincarnated South Sea Queen. The rest of 
   the film is nearly a scene-by-scene (albeit surreal) steal of </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="terminator_1984.htm">THE

   blowing away anyone who gets between her and Rademaker. The Queen

   ends when Rademaker plunges her great-grandfather's eel dagger into

   short 83 minute running time. But violence is the name of the game 
   here, as bullets fly fast and furiously and everything blows up real

    OF DOOM</A><A NAME="LandOfDoom"></A> (1985) -</B> Simply awful 
   post-nuke film that, for once, doesn't come from Italy (it's 
   American-made, but lensed in Turkey). Harmony (Deborah Rennard) is 
   the lone survivor when her village is attacked by a band of 
   motorcycle-riding raiders led by Purvis (Frank Garet), who rape and 
   kill the women and shoot everyone else in the back. Harmony escapes 
   to a cave, where she encounters an injured man named Anderson 
   (Garrick Dowhen), who is wanted by Purvis' boss Slater (Daniel 
   Radell). Slater now must wear a mask over his horribly-burned face, 
   the result of his last encounter with Anderson. Slater orders Purvis 
   and his raiders to capture Anderson at any cost and bring him back so 
   Slater can exact his revenge. After setting some ground rules 
   (Harmony doesn't like to be touched), Harmony and Anderson band 
   together and set out to find the legendary city where there is no 
   shortage of food or water and the people live together in paradise. 
   They have a run-in with Slater's crazy brother Demister (also 
   portrayed by Radell), but Harmony bashes his head in with a rock, 
   killing him. They steal Demister's motorcycle and search for food and 
   water for their trip, stopping at the ranch of an old man, who <A HREF="land_of_doom_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/land of doom vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="155" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>offers
    them a hot meal. Harmony soon finds out that the meat is actually 
   human flesh, as the old man and his followers are cannibals and he 
   has a barn full of dead bodies hanging on hooks. Anderson and Harmony 
   make a hasty retreat and escape on foot, only to be attacked by a 
   group of plague-infected nomads. After successfully fighting them 
   off, our duo spot Purvis and the raiders attacking another village, 
   so they steal another motorcycle (and are nearly captured by Purvis) 
   and continue on their journey. They save a man named Orland (Aykut 
   Duz) and his pet puppy from a pack of wild dogs, so Orland follows 
   them on his bicycle (!), only to watch helplessly as Anderson and 
   Harmony are ambushed and captured by Slater's men. Orland and his 
   puppy get help from a bunch of hooded dwarves to raid Slater's 
   compound and save Anderson and Harmony. They all band together to 
   defeat Slater, Purvis and the raiders, but the cop-out ending will 
   have you screaming for the filmmakers' blood. Talk about failing to 
   deliver on a promise. Where's my lawyer?&nbsp; <B><A HREF="land_of_doom_1985c.htm">LAND

   to emulate <B><A HREF="road_warrior_1982.htm">THE ROAD WARRIOR</A></B> 
   (1982), but comes up way short in nearly department. Deborah Rennard 
   as Harmony is one of the most unlikable heroines you're ever likely 
   to see. Her constant rants of &quot;Don't touch me!&quot; aimed at 
   Anderson actually had me hoping that he would rape her while she 
   slept, just to teach her a lesson about being constantly obnoxious 
   and annoying (I know rape is no laughing matter, but she really is a 
   bitch!). She also carries a crossbow that she never uses (it's always 
   in an uncocked state). The chase scenes are so slow and awkwardly 
   filmed, you half-expect everyone to jump off their motorcycles and 
   run after each other just to pick up the pace. This is also the type 
   of film where people make believe they are firing their guns (they 
   jerk their hands as they pull the trigger like kids playing &quot;cops
    and robbers&quot;), as there is no muzzle flash and the sounds of 
   gunshots are dubbed in post-synch. I guess Maris didn't have the 
   budget to use blanks. The pack of &quot;wild&quot; dogs are probably 
   the crew's pets and look about as threatening as a teething baby. The 
   hooded tribe of dwarves are definitely children in disguise (Hey, 
   it's Turkey, so there were probably no messy child labor laws to 
   worry about!) and the gore and nudity are sparse to the point of 
   being non-existent (just a bloody head bashing, a quick look at the 
   cannibalized bodies hanging in the barn and a few bullet squibs). 
   Toss in a non-ending that leaves the film wide-open for a sequel 
   (which, thankfully, never happened) and you'll swear that this film 
   should have been titled LAND OF CRAP. The only entertaining bit comes 
   when one of the raiders says, &quot;You stink!&quot; to one of his 
   fellow raiders who gives him a lift on his motorcycle. The other 
   raider gets off his motorcycle, punches the guy in the head (knocking 
   him on his ass) and then gets back on his cycle, only to immediately 
   ride his bike over a cliff! It's a real &quot;What the fuck?!?&quot; 
   moment. If only the film managed to sustain that level of lunacy but, 
   sadly, it doesn't. Avoid it unless you are a post-apocalypse 
   completist. Also known as <B><A HREF="raiders_of_death_1985.htm">RAIDERS

    just been kidnapped by Lucas and his right-hand female sidekick 
   Baalca (Nancy Pataki). Enter Danielle, who saves Harris (Scott 
   Andersen) from Lucas' Border Patrol after they kill his mother. 
   Harris, who is Claudia's boyfriend, talks Danielle into accompanying 
   him to the Raiders' compound, where they plan on rescuing Claudia and 
   Zak. Lesbian Baalca has her own plans for Claudia (we watch as 
   Baalca's female assistants give her a naked oil rubdown), but Lucas 
   wants her for his bride instead, which leads to some internal 
   turmoil. Baalca kills Zak after he gives her the location of arms 
   dealers Chuck (Ken Farmer) and Iodine (Joe Maffei), two characters 
   returning from the first film (but played by different actors). 
   Baalca leads the Raiders on an attack on Chuck and Iodine's compound, 
   which is protected by a computer named Dolores, who guards the 
   compound like a video game (another returning theme from the first 
   film). Meanwhile, Danielle is kidnapped by a band of cannibals and

   mutated father's seed into Claudia, in hopes of delivering a 
   superbaby that will eventually lead a new race of superhumans (When

   and the screenplay (by Chris Maruna) tosses aside the series of 
   vignettes that made the fist film so disjointed, opting this time for 
   a more linear story. <B>LAST OF THE WARRIORS</B> is still a cheesy, 
   low-rent production, but at least this time the stunts are bigger, 
   the car crashes better, the gunfights and explosions 
   well-choreographed and the makeup and special effects gorier and more 
   believable. The entire production is much glossier than the first 
   film, as the budget allows for bloody bullet squibs, some decent

   (1988) -</B> It really is true what they say: You never see how 
   cheaply a film has been made until you watch it on Blu-Ray. Well, 
   this 1988 film never made that so true. It has been a favorite of 
   mine since its VHS release, but now I look upon it a little 
   differently (in good and bad ways) after watching it on Blu-Ray. The 
   story is simple:&nbsp; On July 20, 1969, astronaut Neil Armstrong 
   never knew how close he and his lunar module became alien property 
   when a robot alien (who travels under the lunar surface) spots 
   Armstrong blasting off the moon and hooking up with his waiting 
   orbiting comrade. Cut to 20 years later where Shuttle commander Col. 
   Jason Grant (<B><A HREF="star_trek_1966.htm">STAR TREK</A></B>'s 
   Walter Keonig, in the biggest film role of his career) and co-pilot 
   Ray Tanner (Bruce Campbell; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#MyNameIsBruce">MY
    NAME IS BRUCE</A></B> - 2006, where a joke is made about this film!) 
   are orbiting the Moon when they come across what looks like a 
   derelict alien spacecraft floating in space. Jason decides to make a 
   spacewalk to see what he can discover and finds a brown pod-like 
   device (Never a good thing. Hasn't he ever watched horror films?) and the<A HREF="moontrap_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/moontrap vhs front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="171" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   skeleton of a humanoid-like creature. He brings both aboard and lands 
   on Earth, where scientists study the skeleton, but are unable to open 
   the pod with any known Earth tool (Uh, oh!). A government exec thinks 
   this is NASA's way of increasing their budget for the year (he thinks 
   both items were planted!), so they all go out to the coffee room to 
   talk. While they are there, the pod opens and a smaller robot like we 
   saw in the beginning takes control on NASA's computers and uses parts 
   from the corpse and electronic parts to make a giant robot of itself, 
   which it then proceeds to kill the NASA Security Team (it shoots 
   electric rays out of its head), until Jason gets the idea to use the 
   vent above the robot to shotgun it in its brain, the robot's only 
   weak spot. When Jason pulls the trigger, the robot explodes into a 
   million pieces. Jason and Ray think this is the perfect time to make 
   another moon landing to try and find this robot race's headquarters 
   (it has been 20 years since anyone landed on the moon and, as of 2015 
   (when this review was written), we still haven't. Jason always wanted 
   to walk on the moon but thought he was &quot;too young in the 60's 
   and too old in the 80's&quot; to command a spacecraft to the moon. 
   But that is just what he gets and with Ray by his side. The next time 
   we see the duo, they are walking on the Moon (the budget wouldn't 
   allow them to show an actual landing) and take the lunar rover to go 
   look around. While they are doing that, a giant alien robot steals 
   their lunar lander (more on that later) and Jason and Ray find some 
   kind of homebase that isn't the robots'. It looks like some sort of 
   temple for a humanoid alien race because it has five fingers 
   indentations to open doors (maybe our ancestors?) and discover a 
   female humanoid named Mera (Leigh Lombardi; <B><A HREF="murphys_law_1986.htm">MURPHY'S
    LAW</A></B> - 1986) in a state of cryogenics, She wakes up and cries 
   when she sees the skeleton of her husband guarding her sleeping 
   chamber. Now our trio (Mera still hasn't learned English, but she is 
   catching on) begin the walk back to the lunar module, when they are 
   told by their orbiting buddy Beck (Tom Case), that something moved 
   the module and they must look for it. As soon as Beck says that, his 
   ship goes bonkers and crashes on the Moon's surface. Suddenly, giant 
   robots jump up from beneath the Moon's surface (the film's most 
   effective scene) and Jason, Ray and Mera must fight them (I like the 
   fact that the firing space weapons made no sound because there is no 
   sound in space), until Ray is killed by one of them and Jason blows 
   it away. Jason and Mera rest in a portable Moon tent (you really have 
   to see it to believe it), where they make love (C'mon now!) until a 
   brief glimpse of a robotized Ray appears at the window (Jason blows 
   its head off). Jason and Mera are then knocked out by two giant 
   robots and taken to the derelict spaceship that Jason explored 
   earlier in the film. It is at that time Jason discovers that he and 
   Mera are just merely parts for the alien robots and the real thing 
   they were looking for was the lunar module, which will make the 
   spaceship fly (A super-intelligent alien race needs 20 year-old 
   American technology to make their spaceship run? And they waited 
   14,000 years for it to happen? My brain hurts!). Jason manages to 
   break free while one of the robots tries to remove a piece of Mera, 
   saves her and blows up the lunar module, using the propulsion of his 
   firing weapons to allow him and Mera to leave the ship through a 
   breach in the hull (the ship explodes) and being picked-up by the 
   crew of waiting shuttle Intrepid. Back on Earth, Jason and Mera (who 
   are now living together) wonder if these aliens will ever make it to 
   Earth. We then cut to an auto junkyard, where a brown pod opens and a 
   small robot appears. THE END. It's obvious that director/producer 
   Robert Dyke (the vastly underrated and underseen <B><A HREF="timequest_2000.htm">TIMEQUEST</A></B> 
   - 2000; there are talks that he is making a sequel to <B><A HREF="moontrap_1988.htm">MOONTRAP</A></B> 
   in 2015, but it is still a rumor) and screenwriter Tex Ragsdale (his 
   only screenwriting credit, although his name is attached to the 
   rumored sequel) were working here on a very low budget and what 
   low-resolution VHS was able to cover-up, film-quality Blu-Ray just 
   exposes. The miniatures used in this film are now quite obvious (so 
   is the stock footage supplied by NASA), as are the cheap optical 
   effects. While we can see the robots in all their full-featured 
   glory, we can also see that they are not as complex as we once 
   thought they were, but it was a nice touch using the skeleton's torso 
   as a robot body part for the scene back on Earth. This still isn't a 
   bad film; quite far from it, but Walter Koenig is really not a great 
   actor (that is probably why he was not offered more major parts other 
   than as &quot;Chekov&quot; in the <B><A HREF="star_trek_2_the_wrath_of_khan_1982.htm">STAR
    TREK</A></B> series and film sequels) and the normally manic Bruce 
   Campbell seems to be running on autopilot here. There's a lot to 
   like, including taking scientific facts about space seriously (except 
   for that damned Moon tent!) and some of the robot scenes do make you 
   jump. It's a minor film for sure, and I'm surprised it received the 
   Blu-Ray treatment (it looks absolutely wonderful), but you could do a 
   lot, lot worse than watching this sometimes involving science fiction 
   film that seems to imply that we all came from the Moon. Also 
   starring Robert Kurcz, John J. Saunders, Reavis Graham, Judy Levitt 
   and Reuben Yabuku. There are longer versions of this film in Japan 
   and other countries that offer more exposition (but no further 
   violence) between Jason and his son (Doug Childs), but since it is 
   just talk, it would do nothing to improve the film. This version says 
   all you need to know. I'm still a little stymied as to why this film 
   received an R-Rating, since the majority of violence is robots 
   blowing up (even robot Campbell's exploding head lasts less than a 
   second) and most of the human deaths are bloodless (all we see of 
   Campbell's death is blood coming out of his mouth and nose), so a 
   PG-13 Rating would seem more appropriate. But this film was released 
   at a time when the MPAA was cracking down on violence on all 
   independent horror and science fiction films, so I am not surprised.

   determined scientist who translates the writings <A HREF="moontrap_target_earth_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/moontrap target earth poster6a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>and
    discovers this isn't an alien spacecraft at all, but it was built by 
   an advanced human civilization called the &quot;Krell&quot; that 
   predates recorded history, some 14,000 years ago (sound familiar?). 
   It also turns out that one of the members of this race of advanced 
   humans was called Garen (Tarick Salmaci), whom every religious person 
   on Earth now prays to as their Lord God! For reasons not explained, 
   the Krell disappeared off the face of the Earth, just like the 
   Aztecs. With that premise, you are either going to abhor this or hate 
   it with a mighty passion (anyone who likes it must be a sandwich 
   short of a picnic basket!), as a cabal of rich elite people hire 
   Richard Kontral (Charles Shaughnessy, the only actor in this film to 
   give a winning performance) to destroy the spaceship and kill Scout 
   and her boyfriend, scientist Daniel Allen (Damon Dayoub), before the 
   truth about who God really is destroys the cabal's hold on the people 
   on Earth (Imagine being told that God was actually a human man and 
   not an all-seeing being. Religion would cease to exist, except for 
   those who would believe this was some sort of government conspiracy, 
   as well as people who still have a false sense of &quot;faith&quot;.).
    Putting that ridiculouis notion aside, a red robot inside the 
   spaceship kidnaps Scout and Kontral and flies to the Moon, where the 
   red robot is eventually attacked by a blue robot, which results in 
   the red robot exploding and the blue robot having its faceplate 
   ripped off. Kontral, who studied the red robot piloting the 
   spacecraft to the Moon, steals the spacecraft when the red robot and 
   Scout walk on the Moon's surface, but he ends up crashing the 
   spaceship back on the Moon and dying. An ancient temple rises up from 
   the Moon's surface, revealing to Scout that Galen's body is inside in 
   a state of suspended animation and she is to replace Galen's lover as 
   his mate (for some unexplained reason, Galen's lover, Mya [Niki 
   Spiridakos] failed him somehow and died before her mission was 
   complete, so Scout is to take her place), also in a state of 
   suspended animation (huh?). Just as she is about to become God's 
   bride, the blue robot enters the temple with Kontral's torn-off face 
   replacing its missing faceplate (sound familiar?). Scout manages to 
   destroy it (by poking it in Kontral's eyes with her fingers!), just 
   as the temple shoots out a giant yellow ray that envelopes the Moon 
   and terraforms it into a miniature Earth, complete with blue sky and 
   breathable oxygen. Scout then joins her Lord and lover God Galen in a 
   state of suspended animation, but not before writing this message to 
   all Earthlings on the entrance of the temple: <B>&quot;A New World; 
   Don&#146;t Screw it Up &#151; Scout&quot;</B>, as we watch a small 
   plant rise up out of the Moon's surface, offering a new hope for 
   mankind. Sweet Jesus, son of Galen, this &quot;sequel&quot; sucks in 
   so many ways, I won't even bother explaining it. Needless to say, 
   this film jumps from scene-to-scene with no connective tissue between 
   them, such as when Daniel is gunned down and killed by a helicopter 
   gunship (and it doesn't see Scout sitting right next to him!), and 
   Scout wakes up and thinks it was all a nightmare. Turns out it wasn't 
   a nightmare at all (her nightmare was the nightmare, or so I think!) 
   as the next scene shows Scout mourning the death of Daniel (the cabal 
   made it look like Scout killed Daniel and she is now wanted by the 
   authorities) and trying to kill Kontral, but is stopped by Kontral's 
   right hand female assassin Nicole (Jennifer Kincer), who is a really 
   lousy assassin (her love of cigarette breaks is what allowed Scout to 
   get close enough to Kontral to try and kill him!). Let's talk about 
   the robots for a minute. Better yet, let's not talk about them at 
   all, as their movements are sloppy and simply terrible. They shuffle 
   in small steps rather than walking, so anyone could run away from 
   them with ease, but none of them even try to (because they shoot 
   deadly rays from their faceplates, as Nicole is the first one to feel 
   the red robot's wrath!). To say that this film is total amateur hour 
   is to give it too much credit, as it is cheap looking, the CGI is 
   terrible and the acting (except for Shaughnessy, who is a hoot) is 
   simply awful (Unlike the many robots in the first film, there are 
   only two robots in this one, but it is never explained why the blue 
   and red robots are bitter enemies). There are dribs and drabs of gore 
   and some nudity, but none of it is worth writing home about (Nicole 
   kills Scout and Daniel's assistant with an automatic weapon fitted 
   with a silencer and then pours gasoline over his body and sets it on 
   [CGI] fire. Simply terrible looking). Most reference sites give this 
   film a 2017 production date (including the IMDb), but the end credits 
   inform us that it is actually a 2015 production. It just took two 
   years for this crapterpiece to escape, thanks to Sony Pictures Home 
   Entertainment. For the love of our God Galen, stay away from this film!</FONT></FONT></P>

   player, gets lost in a transporter beam for 23 years until the crew 
   from the U.S.S. Bounty accidently bump into him. Due to a malfunction 
   in the ship's transporter room, Max materializes in mutated form, his

   The captain of the ship dies of a heart attack after seeing Max's

   works for the company that commissioned the Bounty to explore distant 
   planets for plant life, frequently gets on the crew's nerves with his 
   constant demands that they follow company policy (sounds like </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="alien_1979c.htm">ALIEN</A></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">,

   accident causes Max's suitcase to be switched with one that contains 
   a germ warfare weapon owned by a pair of murderous theives. The 
   theives trace the case to the Bounty and take the crew prisoner. This 
   is a hit or miss affair and a lot of the humor depends on what frame 
   of mind you are in. The ship's doctor performs a delicate operation 
   while smoking a cigarette. A man is sucked down a toilet bowl. Max's

   the film the go-ahead to be made. Then a screenplay had to be written 
   so something showed on screen. The truth is that Max has very little 
   to do with the plot, except to introduce the suitcase. High concept

   want to know what really pisses me off? Nearly all of the late Lucio 
   Fulci's output is given the loving treatment it deserves on U.S. DVD 
   and Blu-Ray, except for this film, Fulci's only foray into the 
   post-apocalypse genre. And it's not a half-bad film. But there hasn't 
   been an upgrade of this film on disc since Troma's awful fullscreen 
   DVD transfer in 2001, which was obviously taken from a video master. 
   To add insult to injury, before the film plays, Troma president Lloyd 
   Kaufman comes on screen in a video segment to make fun of the film 
   (saying the film was made 17 years before Ridley Scott's <B><A HREF="gladiator_2000.htm">GLADIATOR</A></B>,
    which this film bears absolutely no resemblance to). For Christ's 
   sake, he can't even pronounce Fulci's name correctly and he mentions 
   Fulci's death due to diabetes while a &quot;funny&quot; <A HREF="new_gladiators_1983_italian_versions.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/new gladiators italian poster10 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="286" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>altercation
    between a Troma crackhead and a citizen plays in the background! 
   I've never seen such insolence in my life (Kaufman did these 
   videotape introductions for many of Troma's early DVD releases and 
   they all were unprofessional and obviously being read off of cue 
   cards, since Kaufman has no idea about genre film history and their 
   important figureheads like Fulci, even though his company has a 
   library of over 200 genre films). He even had the nerve to say this 
   was the unedited Director's Cut, but Fulci passed away four years 
   before Troma even released it and I'm sure a &quot;director's 
   cut&quot; wouldn't be in fullscreen; the director would want to make 
   sure that the film was shown in its proper aspect ratio. After the 
   &quot;hilarious&quot; video segment is done, the film begins to play 
   and the actual title on-screen is <B><A HREF="rome_2072_ad_new_gladiators_1983.htm">ROME,
    2072 A.D. NEW GLADIATORS</A></B> (I bought a DVD under this title 
   off eBay in what I thought was a legitimate widescreen foreign 
   version, only to discover that it was a poor widescreen DVD-R boot of 
   the Japanese VHS tape with Japanese subtitles that fill up half the 
   screen, from gray market company Underground Empire! This is one of 
   the major reasons why I don't use eBay anymore. Just take a look at 
   the DVD cover [by clicking on the title link] to see how much care 
   they put into their illegal releases [The scan was not altered in any 
   way].). Now let's talk about the actual film. This film (Shot under 
   the title <B><I><A HREF="new_gladiators_1983_italian_versions.htm">I 
   guerrieri dell'anno 2072</A></I></B>. Translation: &quot;Warriors Of 
   The Year 2072&quot;) actually predates <B><A HREF="running_man_1987.htm">THE
    RUNNING MAN</A></B> by four years (almost the same scenario used in 
   Joe D'Amato's excellent post-nuke flick <B><A HREF="#Endgame">ENDGAME</A></B> 
   in 1983). After decades of war and death, two television networks 
   compete with reality TV series that show real people getting killed, 
   fighting for their lives for fame, money and fabulous prizes (It 
   seems to me that we are not far from it actually happening, since 
   reality stars today are committing suicide when their 15 minutes of 
   fame are up and they have nowhere to go but down. Can actual death on 
   screen be far behind? It seems to be the only &quot;reality&quot; not 
   being exploited today.). But enough with the social commentary. Both 
   Fulci and D'Amato came up with reality TV a good 15 years before it 
   actually happened, only their reality shows don't show selfish and 
   vain people bitching and moaning at each other. They are shown 
   fighting to the death. In Fulci's film, &quot;Super Champion 
   Drake&quot; (Jared Martin; Fulci's <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Aenigma1987">AENIGMA</A></B> 
   - 1987) is the star of the show &quot;KILL BIKE&quot; (which the 
   announcer says, &quot;Bought to you live, until the death!&quot;), 
   where people from different &quot;sectors&quot; from around the world 
   battle each other on motorcycles to the death. We see Drake perform 
   stunts on his bike (like standing on the seat, where he kicks 
   opponents off their bikes) while killing the competition. In this 
   episode, Drake is once again the winner, as his final competitor 
   crashes his bike into a wall, it exploding into flames while he is 
   still on it. Competing network WBS has a reality show called &quot;THE
    DANGER GAME&quot;, where each week a contestant faces their worse 
   fear and, if they survive, they win a big cash prise. This week's 
   contestant is a woman, whom we see is tied up under a swinging sharp 
   pendulum. She can't control her fear and screams, as the swinging 
   pendulum slices her throat until her head is nearly severed (This 
   being a Fulci film, little is left to the imagination). The 
   differating factor in both competing series is that the people on THE 
   DANGER GAME are really not in any real danger. They have a computer 
   hooked up to their brain and their worst fears play out in virtual 
   reality, so if they die in the computer, they still survive in real 
   life. They just don't win the cash prize. Unfortunately, WBS' ratings 
   are taking a nose dive, so Sam (an uncredited appearance by Giovanni 
   Di Benedetto; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EerieMidnight1974">THE 
   EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW</A></B> - 1974), the owner of WBS, orders 
   his executives to come up with a show that brings back the days of 
   ancient Rome, where gladiators fought each other to the death in an 
   arena (they are actually going to film it in the ruins of Rome's 
   Colosseum!). He gives the network executives, which include Cortez 
   (Claudio Cassinelli; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#FlaviaTheHeretic74">FLAVIA
    THE HERETIC</A></B> - 1974) and Sarah (Eleonora Brigliadori, billed 
   here as &quot;Eleonor Gold&quot;; her first film), 40 days to create 
   the show and tells them that if the ratings don't beat KILL BIKE, 
   they will become contestants on their own show. The show will take 
   twenty Death Row inmates who will fight each other to the death, the 
   winner promised a pardon. When Drake is coming home one night, he 
   sees three whistling thugs murdering his wife Susan (Valeria Cavalli; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#BladeInDark1983">A
    BLADE IN THE DARK</A></B> - 1983; billed here as &quot;Valerie 
   Jones&quot;). Drake supposedly kills the three thugs and is sentenced 
   to Death Row for their murders, so he becomes the new star gladiator 
   on his rival network's soon-to-debut show, which is called &quot;THE 
   BATTLE OF THE DAMNED&quot;. Drake, along with the other Death Row 
   contestants, has a metal band burned into his wrist to keep track of 
   him, and is told by old foe Cortez (who tells Drake he would go to 
   Hell if it would improve ratings) that he has hired evil guard Raven 
   (Harold Ross; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#KillerReserved9Seat">THE 
   KILLER RESERVED NINE SEATS</A></B> - 1974; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#WerewolfWoman1976">WEREWOLF
    WOMAN</A></B> - 1976) to keep him in line and has instructed Raven 
   to use a painful force field weapon on him if he tries to escape. 
   Drake meets his Death Row opponents: Abdul (Fred Williamson; <A HREF="#Nine90BronxWar1982"><B>1990:
    THE BRONX WARRIORS</B></A> - 1982); Kirk (Al Cliver; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Man Hunter 1980">THE

    TEXAS GLADIATORS</A></B> - 1982; another great post-nuke film); and 
   several other who are not given much screen time. Also on hand is 
   Drake's old friend Monk (Donald O'Brien; <B><A HREF="zombie_holocaust_1980.htm">ZOMBIE
    HOLOCAUST</A></B> a.k.a. <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DoctorButcher1980">DOCTOR
    BUTCHER M.D.</A></B> - 1980), an unjustly convicted Death Row inmate 
   with a deformed face and synthetic eyes, who will act as Drake's 
   trainer. The problem is, Drake is actually innocent, as the conscience-stricken
    Sarah shows him footage that reveals that Cortez's goons killed the 
   three whistling killers while Drake was unconscious as he crashed 
   through a window to save his wife (We see one of the goons shoot one 
   of the killers in the face with a ray gun and his face melts away 
   into a pile of goo). It seems Cortez wanted Drake to star on his new 
   show, serving two purposes: To steal him from the rival network and 
   to torture Drake for their past experiences together (which is never 
   really revealed). In the film's most tense moment, Drake tests 
   Raven's dominance by threatening to walk into a disintegration field 
   if Raven doesn't turn it off (Drake knows Cortez and WBS need him 
   alive for the premiere episode) and Raven caves-in, with Drake 
   winning the respect of the Death Row contestants, especially Abdul 
   and Kirk (who Raven was going to kill just for the hell of it after 
   beating him to a pulp). When Drake and Abdul try to escape and are 
   caught, all of the contestants are forced to hang from a bar for 
   thirteen minutes over a deadly electrified floor. When an already 
   battered Kirk can't hang on for the full thirteen minutes, Drake and 
   Abdul come up with a novel way to save him, which pisses off Raven to 
   no end. Sarah goes to Professor Towman (Cosimo Cinieri; Fulci's <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#MurderRock">MURDER
    ROCK-DANCING DEATH</A></B> - 1984), the creator of WBS' 
   super-computer, which he named &quot;Junior&quot;, to tell him that 
   Junior may have become &quot;self-aware&quot;, but the Professor is 
   killed by someone we can't see before he can do anything about it. 
   Another show producer, Sybil (Penny Brown; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CutAndRun1985">CUT
    AND RUN</A></B> - 1985), is also murdered, but who can be doing it? 
   The first episode of THE BATTLE OF THE DAMNED premieres and it's a 
   bona-fide ratings smash, as the Death Row inmates ride motorcycles 
   and use swords, maces and jousting spears in the Colosseum to kill 
   each other or knock them off their bikes (One gladiator on a 
   motorcycle is decapitated when he rides into a taught wire and 
   another gladiator is blown-up on his bike). They then go into 
   hand-to-hand combat using various deadly weapons (lots of stabbing 
   and impalements). During the second half of the show, two gladiators 
   pair-up and ride motorcycles with side cars that are made to look 
   like chariots, as the various &quot;chariots&quot; fight each other 
   for twenty<A HREF="new_gladiators_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/new gladiators dvd9 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="209" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   laps (We see one chariot rider have his head torn off when the 
   chariot hits a fence with sharp spikes on top and another set on fire 
   with a flame thrower and dragged from the back of a chariot).&nbsp; 
   Sarah learns that twenty minutes after the episode is over, Cortez 
   plans to terminate the remaining gladiators by 
   &quot;de-materializing&quot; them using the metal wristbands they all 
   wear, so Cortez can discredit Sam and take over WBS. Sarah shows up 
   on the track to warn Drake and Abdul about what is going to happen, 
   so the only way to stop them from being killed is to destroy the 
   control tower at the top of the Colosseum (When Raven runs out onto 
   the track to stop Sarah, he is stabbed with a sword and run over with 
   a chariot). Cortez, to save his own life, tells Drake, Abdul and 
   other surviving gladiators that Sam is behind it all and they have 
   six minutes to live before their wristbands vaporize them (When Kirk 
   removes the band from his wrist, he dies instantly). They discover 
   Sam isn't human at all, but just a human avatar created by 
   super-computer Junior. Sarah has one last way to destroy Junior (who 
   is hidden in a satellite high above Earth). Monk won't let anyone 
   destroy Junior because the computer gave him back his sight with the 
   synthetic eyes it created for him. Drake has to blast his friend with 
   a ray gun (one of Monk's artificial eyes pops out of its socket, 
   which they all discover is a hidden camera that kept a visual eye on 
   them all) and they now know that Monk was a spy for Junior. It turns 
   out that Junior's destruction code sequence can be found in the 
   memory of the eye Monk used to spy on them and they destroy the 
   satellite just in the nick of time before all the gladiators die. The 
   future doesn't change because of this, but a lot of Death Row killers 
   can now walk the streets freely, so that should make everyone feel 
   safe (ahem).&nbsp; Entertaining from beginning to end, thanks to a 
   screenplay from Fulci, Cesar Frugoni, Dardano Sacchetti and Elisa 
   Briganti (the last two [who have been married to each other for a 
   long time] also co-writing the screenplays to <B><A HREF="inglorious_bastards_1978.htm">THE

   not one of Fulci's gorefests). I'm surprised this film doesn't get 
   the recognition it deserves for predicting the Reality TV craze, 
   critics rather pointing to <B><A HREF="running_man_1987.htm">THE 
   RUNNING MAN</A></B> as the most influential (proving that most 
   critics don't know their ass from their elbow, even though the Arnold 
   Schwarzenegger film mentions this movie in a quick bit of dialogue). 
   Some of the futuristic miniature effects (from Al Passeri, future 
   director of the absolutely terrible <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#creatures abyss">CREATURES
    FROM THE ABYSS</A></B> - 1994) are very well done for such a 
   low-budget affair, but the same cannot be said for the optical 
   effects (also by Passeri), which are cheap and unconvincing. People 
   with epilepsy should be warned because many of the scenes have a 
   quick flashing effect (done on purpose) and it may cause you to have 
   fits. Originally released on VHS by <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Media Home Ent.">Media

   fullscreen DVD release from Troma, so I think it is time for some 
   label to pick up the slack and give this film its proper due on 
   widescreen DVD &amp; Blu-Ray. There are a lot of Fulci fans out there 
   and this one is guaranteed to be a big seller. My only worry is that 
   Troma outright owns this film in perpetuity, which means we will 
   never see a proper version of this. That would suck. Also starring

    the genre, usually using Anglicized pseudonyms. But, for my money, 
   no one made more entertaining post-apocalypse films better than Enzo 
   G. Castellari, who used not only post-nuke themes, but 
   &quot;borrowed&quot; ideas from other films as well. This film was 
   one of the first to be released theatrically after the success of the 
   Mel Gibson blockbuster and it not only contains themes from that 
   film, but also has major nods to <B><A HREF="warriors_1979.htm">THE WARRIORS</A></B> 
   (1979) and <B><A HREF="escape_from_new_york_1981.htm">ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK</A></B> 
   (1981). In the beginning of the film, we are informed that &quot;In 
   1990, the Bronx is officially declared 'No Man's Land'. The 
   authorities gave up on all attempts to restore law and order. From 
   then on, the area is ruled by 'The Riders'&quot; (I know some people 
   in the Bronx today that would agree with that very statement!). We 
   then see young woman Ann (Stefania Girolami; Castellari's <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Last Shark">THE
    LAST SHARK</A></B> - 1981; she's the daughter of the director) 
   running across a bridge into the Bronx. It seems some important 
   people want to get their hands on her, but she thinks hiding out in 
   the Bronx will deter their search. It won't. Ann escaped from a 
   private school she was forced to attend, so when she escapes, the CEO 
   of The Manhattan Corporation, Samuel Fisher (Enio Girolami; 
   Castellari's <B><A HREF="action.htm#DayOfTheCobra1980">DAY OF THE COBRA</A></B> 
   - 1980; he's the brother of the director), hires &quot;The 
   Hammer&quot; (Vic Morrow, in one of his last movies before he was 
   beheaded by a helicopter accident on the set of <B><A HREF="twilight_zone_the_movie_1982.htm">TWILIGHT
    ZONE: THE MOVIE</A></B> - 1983) to capture Ann, who we see is being 
   harassed by The Zombies, a rollerskating gang that carry hockey 
   sticks. Along come the motorcycle-riding gang The Riders, whose 
   leader, Trash (Mark Gregory; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#WarBusCommando">WAR
    BUS COMMANDO</A></B> [1989]; whose one expression is that of someone 
   cutting a wet one and he can't get the stink out of his nose,) saves 
   Ann after he and his three gang members take out The Zombie members 
   in memorable ways (One Rider member has a motorcycle equipped with 
   spring loaded blades. He makes one pass at two Zombie members running 
   away and cuts their legs, causing them to fall. When he returns, he 
   cuts the throats on the prone-position Zombie members with the 
   blades.). Trash is actually a nice guy and asks Ann he he would like 
   him to return her to the safety of Manhattan, but Ann says she would 
   rather stay in the Bronx (Trash says, &quot;Nothing is worse than 
   this hellhole!&quot;, to which Ann replies, &quot;That's what you 
   think!&quot;). Ann joins The Riders (she even gets her own 
   motorcycle) and their first stop is a pier on the ocean where one of 
   Trash's buddies is found impaled on a huge shard of wood (to make the 
   scene even weirder, we see a drummer in the distance playing his drum 
   kit, like it is the theme music for The Riders!). Enter The Tigers 
   (and a different drumming tune!), another gang that drives impeccably 
   souped-up versions of classic hot rods. The head of The Tigers, The 
   Ogre (Fred Williamson, who is no stranger to Italian post-nuke films, 
   appearing in four of them!), tells Trash that he killed his friend 
   because he was working undercover for the police in Manhattan and 
   pulls out a tracking device (which looks like a digital wristwatch) 
   that he says his friend was wearing (In this film, the police are the 
   worst of the worst, putting any of the Bronx gangs to shame when it 
   comes to dirty deeds, something else I'm sure a lot of people in the 
   real Bronx actually think is true!). The Ogre tells Trash to watch 
   his back, because if his friend was working for the police, odds are 
   another member is, too (He's right, as we will soon find out). Sam 
   Fisher assures his boss (played by the director using the name 
   &quot;Enzo Girolami&quot;, which is what the &quot;G&quot; stands for 
   in Enzo G. Castellari) that he will bring Ann (Which he calls 
   &quot;The most influential woman in the world&quot;) out of the Bronx 
   and to the safety of Manhattan, a feat which will prove difficult 
   because, for the first time in her life, Ann feels safe in the arms 
   of Trash and makes him promise to never let anyone take her away. 
   Problems arise when The Hammer (which Fred Williamson must have been 
   pissed at, since he was known as &quot;The Hammer&quot; as far back 
   as his 1972 blaxploitation film <B><A HREF="hammer_1972.htm">HAMMER</A></B>.
    Even I still call him Fred &quot;The Hammer&quot; Williamson and he 
   loves to be called that!) shows up at The Riders headquarters and 
   kills two members at point-blank rage with blasts fron his shotgun, 
   so Trash and the rest of the gang chase him, seeing him jump on the 
   running board of a semi truck traveling down the street. Trash and 
   his gang manage to stop the semi, but the only person they find 
   inside is the club-footed Hot Dog (Christopher Connelly; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Raiders Of Atlantis">THE
    RAIDERS OF ATLANTIS</A></B> - 1983); somehow The Hammer has escaped. 
   Before Trash and his gang give their two dead members a Viking-style 
   funeral, Trash finds a ring in the shape of a tiger's head next to 
   their bodies, which vocal member Ice (John Loffredo; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LadyFrankenstein">LADY
    FRANKENSTEIN</A></B> - 1971), Trash's right-hand man, takes to mean 
   that The Tigers are responsible and wants to have a rumble with them, 
   but the level-headed Trash thinks this whole situation is a little 
   too pat and is nothing but a trap. Then Ann tells Trash who she 
   really is. When she turns 18 years-old in a few days, she will 
   inherit the Manhattan Corporation, which controls 60% of the world's 
   arms production and many people want to kidnap her (including her 
   father, the vice-president of The Manhattan Corporation), so she 
   signs the controlling interest over to them before they kill her. In 
   other words, she is worth a shitload of money. Ann is kidnapped by 
   The Zombies, whose leader is Golan (Italian staple George Eastman; 
   real name: Luigi Montefiori, who has done more for Italian genre 
   films than any other actor, appearing in five Italian post-nuke 
   films, starring in classic films like Mario Bava's <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Rabid Dogs">RABID

    HUNTER</A></B> [1981] and directing <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Metamorphosis">METAMORPHOSIS</A></B> 
   [1989]), so Trash and three of his men must travel to the other side 
   of the Bronx, battling several costumed gangs, to get to The Tigers 
   headquarters and ask The Ogre for his help. Trash makes a deal with 
   the female head&nbsp; (Carla Brait; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Torso1973">TORSO</A></B> 
   - 1973) of The Iron Men Gang (who look like they stepped out of a 
   dress rehearsal of Pippin!) to cross her territory without fighting, 
   but Trash and his three men will have to fight a few other gangs (one 
   of them dresses as mummies!) to get to The Tigers and not all will 
   make it. Meanwhile, Ice has become a turncoat and is now working with 
   The Hammer, who murders one of The Ogre's lieutenants and pins it on 
   Trash. Just like Trash, The Ogre is a level-headed leader and doesn't 
   for a minute believe that Trash is responsible for the death (It's 
   nice to watch a film where leaders of gangs use their brains as much 
   as they use their fists), so he agrees to join Trash (with his trusty 
   whip-wielding right-hand woman Witch, played by Betty Dessy [her only 
   film]) and rescue Ann. The despicable Ice also makes a deal with 
   Golan to make money off of Ann and control the entire Bronx together. 
   Trash finds friend and fellow Riders member Leech (Angelo Ranguso) 
   strung-up and nearly dead. He tells Trash of Ice's plans and then 
   dies. Hot Dog is also tired of being used by The Hammer and the 
   Manhattan Corporation and decides to do something about it. The Ogre 
   kills Golan and Trash frees Ann, while Hot<A HREF="1990_the_bronx_warriors_1982_blu-ray.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/1990 the bronx warriors blu-ray8 front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="251" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Dog delays Ice long enough (but dies in the process when Ice kicks 
   him in the stomach with a knife blade that protrudes out of the toe 
   of his boot) for Trash to reach him and fight Ice in a battle to the 
   death. Ice falls down a hole in the floor and is impaled in the 
   stomach by a piece of rebar sticking out of the floor. The gangs 
   party, while Ann plays piano, as they celebrate her 18th birthday and 
   give her a cake in the shape of the Bronx. But The Hammer and his 
   flame-thrower goon squad interrupt the celebration and kill nearly 
   everyone, including Ann, while The Hammer just stands there laughing 
   maniacally (The Ogre and Ann's deaths are particularly poignant, as 
   are a few people, including Witch, that we see burning to death). The 
   film ends with Trash killing The Hammer and dragging his body 
   throughout the streets of the Bronx on the back of his motorcycle as 
   the end credits roll. Don't worry, because Trash will return to take 
   on a slew of new bad guys in Castellari's sequel <B><A HREF="#BronxWarriors2">BRONX
    WARRIORS 2</A></B> (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="escape_from_the_bronx_1983.htm">ESCAPE
    FROM THE BRONX</A></B> - 1983).&nbsp; Although there are much more 
   violent post-nuke films, the screenplay, by Castellari, Dardano 
   Sacchetti and&nbsp; Elisa Briganti (the last two also co-wrote the 
   screenplays to Lucio Fulci's <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Zombie">ZOMBIE</A></B> 
   [1979] and Lamberto Bava's <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#BladeInDark1983">A
    BLADE IN THE DARK</A></B> [1983]), manages to give some of the 
   leaders of the gangs a sense of humanity, even if they are living in 
   subhuman conditions. That's not to say that they won't get violent 
   when the circumstances demand it (The Ogre beheads a rival gang 
   member when he tries to bite Trash, but Trash politely says 
   &quot;Thanks&quot; to The Ogre.). Since most of the major players 
   (besides Christopher Connelly) are dubbed, even though it looks like 
   everyone is speaking English, the dialogue can sometimes be clumsy, 
   but Enzo C. Castellari manages to build suspense and turn in a quite 
   depressing finale, something I didn't expect. Castellari is an old 
   hand at directing Italian genre films of every kind, making Spaghetti 
   Westerns, Giallo films, Poliziottescos (Italian police and crime 
   films), War Films (<B><A HREF="inglorious_bastards_1978.htm">THE

   that's not to say that some of them couldn't be enjoyable. 
   Unfortunately, this movie can't be considered one of those films. 
   It's more like an endurance test. We see a voodoo ritual where people 
   (both black and white) are gyrating to native music (some women even 
   go topless), while two men in tuxedos are begged to stop the voodoo 
   ritual by a girl (she ends up garroted with a wire by one of the 
   men). We then witness a man lying on a table at the voodoo ritual, 
   his chest cut open with a huge knife by voodoo priestess Mama Dora 
   (Betty Vaughn) and having his skin removed from his body while he 
   screams. Soon-to-be groom Barney Sanford (Joe Reddig) has inherited a 
   security firm from his deceased father and Barney is unintentionally 
   running the company to the ground. We then see cyborg investigator 
   Waldo Warren (Rick Gianisi) saving a girl from a kidnapping he was 
   paid to protect. Also watching him are four mysterious men who want 
   him dead. Barney can get a security contract from the country of San 
   Caribe, a small (fictional) Caribbean island, but he is going to have 
   to get Waldo Warren's help as protection (There is no explanation on 
   why Waldo Warren is a cyborg. He just is.). Barney and Waldo meet in 
   a bar and then go outside to talk, where Waldo must save Barney's 
   life from a man &amp; woman hit team. Another woman (Luz Vargas) 
   explodes when Mama Dora puts a strange-looking bomb on her back. 
   Barney and company executive Harold (Richard Mooney) go to San Caribe 
   with female assistant Jane (Kate Goldsborough) and meet the island's 
   President Davalos (Anibal Lleras) and his uptight, snotty wife 
   Marianna (Mizan Nunes) at a party at the consulate. Those same four 
   men are also there. One of the men is the head of a competing 
   security firm named Ciprian Lane (Doug Delaughter) and his company 
   has no scruples. They'll take jobs from known U.S. enemies if the 
   price is right. Waldo is also at the party protecting the President's 
   daughter Anjanette (Jennifer Kanter), when three black-hooded 
   assassins with automatic weapons open fire, killing the President and 
   nearly all the other people at the party. It looks like Barney's 
   company is not doing such a great job securing the people, or is he 
   purposely being sabotaged by Ciprian Lane, who wants the San Caribe 
   account? Or is Marianna working in conjunction with the evil Colonel 
   Esteves (Matt Mitler) for more nefarious means? As the camera pans 
   across all the bloody dead bodies at the party, it gives the viewer 
   enough time to figure out that the film has yet to make any sense. 
   And where are Waldo's cyborg powers? Marianna is now in charge of San 
   Caribe. Waldo informs anyone that is still alive (Barney, Harold and 
   Jane made it) that the guard manning the security cameras was the 
   first to die, his throat slit before he could set off the alarm. This 
   means it must be an inside job. Colonel Esteves says it could only be 
   Anjanette (That came out of his mouth a little too quickly and 
   easily). Marianna tells Waldo that there are some people on her 
   island who still believe in the &quot;Dumbala&quot; (voodoo) and will 
   use any means possible to get rid of her. Seems like she is not 
   involved in the assassination at all (at least not in the way it went 
   off). Barney and Harold are attacked by the same male/female hit team 
   we have seen throughout the film, but Barney and Harold fight them 
   off (They are one of the worst hit teams in film history and are 
   eventually killed later in the film. We never learn who hired them.). 
   Marianne and Anjanette take Waldo to a voodoo ceremony, while Ciprian 
   Lane and his men watch from above. Marianne walks through hot coals 
   while Lane's men open fire. Waldo kills one of them and they run 
   away. Turns out Marianne <A HREF="occultist_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/occultist vhs front8 back small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="153" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>and
    Colonel Esteves were in on it, but Marianne swears it was never 
   meant to go this far. Her husband was only meant to get injured. But 
   it turns out the President is actually still alive, but Colonel 
   Esteves deep-fries his face and kills him. The Colonel kills two 
   voodoo men with a weird silver-chained object with a metal spiked 
   skull on the end. It seems to be attached to a briefcase containing 
   $17 million, taken from the country's bank. The voodoo gang capture 
   one of Ciprian Lane's men and Mama Dora kills both him and Marianne 
   by stabbing them in the stomach, but Barney throws Mama Dora on the 
   burning embers, she catches on fire and dies horribly. The voodoo 
   group disappears into the darkness and Anjanette becomes the ruler of 
   San Caribe, but first they have to escape the vengeful Colonel 
   Esteves. Waldo makes his thumb and index finger into the shape of a 
   gun and shoots the Colonel from below and the bullet exits out of the 
   top of the Colonel's head. While Anjanette gives a press conference, 
   Harold informs Barney that his bride-to-be has cancelled the wedding. 
   All Barney can do is shrug his shoulders and try to make his business 
   better.&nbsp; This is one of Tim Kincaid's worst non-porn films, 
   although there are a few funny scenes, such as when Waldo guns-down a 
   couple of people in a mens room with his penis (He tells Barney, 
   &quot;This is going to cost you extra.&quot;), which is actually an 
   automatic weapon, or killing someone with a bullet that fires out of 
   his foot (&quot;I just had that installed.&quot;). The screenplay, by 
   Kincaid, is all over the place and leaves more unanswered questions 
   than answered ones (The biggest ones being: What the hell happened to 
   Ciprian Lane? Who created Waldo Warren?), the acting is worse than 
   terrible (Rick Gianisi appeared in most of Kincaid's straight films,

   minutes, the film seems much too long. The only saving graces are a 
   bit of nudity and the grisly makeup effects by Ed French, who gives 
   us a skinning, Mama Dora's fiery death, the face-frying and multiple 
   bloody bullet hits. Otherwise, I really fail to see what type of

   Railsback, got their start appearing in the no-budget productions 
   from <A HREF="http://www.theasylum.cc">The Asylum</A>, so you know 
   what to expect). The crew of the spaceshup U.S.S. Pandora are on 
   their way back to Earth after a year in space when all hell breaks 
   loose. New captain Darian Holloway (Alexis Zibolis), who inherited 
   the duty when the previous captain died in an accident in an air 
   lock, must contend with a crew who dislike her being the captain, as 
   well as a new alien power source called Thanatos (a glowing neon

    matters is a distress call from a derelict ship where a woman can be 
   heard screaming for her life. The crew doesn't want to answer the 
   distress call since they are so close to finally reaching Earth and 
   there are stories floating around of other ships answering distress 
   calls and never being heard from again, but Captain Holloway orders 
   the crew to dock with the derelict ship and check it out. She should 
   have listened to her crew. As they attempt to dock with the ship, the 
   new power source aboard the Pandora goes haywire and they nearly 
   crash. Flight Officer Briggs (Chad Nell) comments that it was like 
   the Pandora didn't want to dock with the other ship. A search party, 
   consisting of Mason (Robert James; <B><A HREF="dead_men_walking_2005.htm">DEAD

    NIGHT</A></B> - 2006), board the derelict ship and discover that the 
   inside has been gutted and the crew are nowhere to be found, except 
   for four young women who seem scared out of their minds. Once 
   on-board the Pandora, the women tell how they were attacked by space 
   pirates and left for dead, but Captain Holloway believes there is 
   something fishy with their story and rightfully so (it turns out that 
   these four women are actually the pirates). Soon, these four nameless 
   women are seducing the male crew members with the sole purpose of 
   taking over the ship. The only crew members that don't fall for their 
   charms are Science Officer Tarver (Steve Railsback; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Ed Gein">ED
    GEIN</A></B> - 2000), female doctor Landon (Maija Polsley) and 
   Captain Holloway, but it is too late. The four women have taken over 
   the ship, killing Briggs, but during the takeover one of the women 
   accidentally cracks-open the new power source and is sprayed with an 
   unknown liquid within the orb. She transforms into a puss-filled 
   fanged mutant, who begins infecting the Pandora's inhabitants. As 
   Captain Holloway regains control of the Pandora, she and the 
   survivors (It is revealed that Tarver is actually an android. Gee, I 
   wonder what movie they got that idea from?) must find a way to put 
   the power source in an air lock and flush it out into space before 
   they reach Earth. More complications arise when the power source 
   takes complete control of the Pandora, turns off the supply of oxygen 
   and sends its mutants (including the recently-revived body of the 
   first captain, who was Holloway's lover) to kill everyone else. Will 
   Earth be saved or will its entire human population become mutant 
   chow? While it's apparent that director/screenwriter <A HREF="brad_sykes_films.htm">Brad
    Sykes</A> (besides the <B><A HREF="films_on_the_fringe.htm#Camp Blood">CAMP</A> <A HREF="films_on_the_fringe.htm#Camp Blood 2">BLOOD</A></B>

   many times (unmasking Tarver as an android two-thirds into the film 
   is a dead giveaway), he manages to combine it with the again popular 
   zombie genre to at least put a new spin on it. Most of the acting is 
   strictly second tier (even the normally reliable Steve Railsback 
   seems like he's slumming), but there are some good makeup and gore 
   effects on view to keep fans of this film happily occupied. The best 
   effect is when one of the female mutants gets the top half of her 
   head ripped off and she simply grabs her severed noggin off the floor 
   and reattaches it! There's plenty of other gore on view, especially 
   during the final third, including flesh munching, chest-ripping, neck 
   stabbings, face-eating and lots of arterial spray. This is also a 
   very claustrophobic film due to the fact that most of the film takes 
   place on the narrow corridors of the Pandora (an old Roger Corman 
   trick) and the CGI used for the outer space scenes, especially 
   Pandora's destruction in the finale, isn't very good at all. Add it 
   all up and <B><A HREF="plaguers_2008b.htm">PLAGUERS</A></B> is a 
   hit-or-miss flick with a lot to offer gore lovers, but very little 
   else (there is zero nudity considering the mostly female cast) for 
   fans of sci-fi or horror. It's a nice try, but it could have been a 
   lot better. Also starring Noelle Perris, Paige La Pierre, Stephanie

    The crew of the Argos receive an SOS message from the Galliot, 
   Captain Sallas begging for help, saying that he nor his crew have 
   very long to live. When the message goes dead, Mark and his crew 
   pinpoint where the Galliot has landed and go on foot looking for it, 
   but it won't be easy because Aura's surface is very hot and the 
   atmosphere is full of a strange fog-like mist. Mark and his crew 
   carefully make their way to the Galliot and once they get there, they 
   find two crewmembers lying dead outside the ship and it is obvious 
   that they killed each other. The hatch of the Galliot is locked from 
   the inside, but when they look into a window, Mark can see that 
   everyone, including his brother Toby, are dead, all lying of the 
   floor covered in blood; the result of them attacking and killing each 
   other. Mark and his crew search the outside of the ship and find 
   another dead body, so they wrap all three bodies in plastic and bury 
   them in their own steel coffins on the surface of Aura. Mark tells 
   crewmember Eldon (Mario Morales; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#CrossCurrent">CROSS
    CURRENT</A></B> - 1971) to stand guard outside the Galliot while he 
   and the rest of the crew head back to the Argos to get a welding 
   torch to open the Galliot's hatch door. As Eldon is standing guard, 
   he hears some creepy voices calling his name, as if it is coming from 
   the mist on Aura's surface. When Mark and his crew return, they 
   discover that not only is Eldon missing, so are the&nbsp; dead bodies 
   of the crewmembers inside the Galliot. Dr. Karan mentions that they 
   could all be suffering from a shared hallucination, that is until 
   Wess shows him the blood where one member of the crew was lying. So 
   how did the bodies disappear? It doesn't take long to find out, as we 
   watch the three buried crewmembers burst out of their steel coffins, 
   tearing the plastic off their bodies and walking on their own, no 
   longer looking quite human and more alien in appearance (a really 
   effective scene guaranteed to send chills down your body).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When everyone is back at the Argos, luminous globes of light 
   surround the ship and Bert (Franco Andrei), who is standing guard 
   outside, screams in pain and dies, his last words being, &quot;Captain
    Sallas!&quot; Mark and Wess carry Bert's body inside the Argos, when

   what happens next.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    A member of the crew sees something shiny in the distance, so Mark, 
   Sanya (Norma Bengell; <B><A HREF="i_do_not_forgive_i_kill_1968.htm">I 
   DO NOT FORGIVE...I KILL!</A></B> - 1968) and Carter (Ivan Rassimov; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EatenAlive1980">EATEN
    ALIVE!</A></B> - 1980) go to investigate, finding an ancient 
   derelict alien ship and the skeleton of an alien, three times the 
   size of a human. Mark and Sanya go inside the ship while Carter 
   stands guard outside. The interior of the ship seems functional, yet 
   it is full of debris, inches of dirt on the floor and cobwebs are 
   everywhere, as if it hasn't been occupied for centuries, if not 
   longer (There's another huge&nbsp; alien skeleton in the Control Room 
   and if it doesn't remind you of a certain scene in <B><A HREF="alien_1979c.htm">ALIEN</A></B> 
   [1979], then you, my friend are as blind as a bat!). Sanya notices a 
   piece of alien technology next to the skeleton that seems to be 
   functional and when she touches it, it shocks her with 200 volts of 
   electricity (Of course, Mark has to touch it, too!). When Mark 
   presses a button on the alien control panel (always a good idea), he 
   hears the alien voice and tells Sanya that the skeleton must have 
   been this ship's captain and what they are listen to is the captain's 
   final log (too bad they can't translate it). But Mark and Sanya have 
   a more serious problem, as the hatch door closes, trapping them 
   inside the control room. Mark calls for Carter, but there is no 
   answer, so Mark destroys some alien technology, knocking over the 
   skeleton, thinking it will open the hatch door, but it doesn't. As 
   all the oxygen is being sucked out of the control room, Sanya finds a 
   huge alien tuning fork on the floor, so Mark tries the tuning fork on 
   the hatch, with no luck. Mark throws the tuning fork to the ground in 
   anger, which activates the piece of alien technology that shocked him 
   and Sanya. Mark picks it up and it shocks him badly, but he painfully 
   carries it to the hatch and it opens, so he and Sanya run outside, 
   but Carter is nowhere to be found. Thinking he ran back to the Argos 
   to get some help, they return to the ship, only to discover that 
   Carter isn't there. To make matters worse, Tiona is very ill, telling 
   Mark and Sanya that she saw the three Galliot crewmembers they buried 
   yesterday and they were very much alive.&nbsp; Not believing Tiona, 
   Mark goes to the burial site and opens the steel coffins, finding 
   them empty (Make sure you watch the piece of plastic as it flies out 
   of one of the graves. It's a little shocking piece of terror that was 
   carefully planned). He believes Tiona now.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The Argos is then visited by &quot;Captain Sallas&quot; and Galliot 
   crewmember Keir (Federico Boido; <B><A HREF="roy_colt_and_winchester_jack_1970.htm">ROY
    COLT &amp; WINCHESTER JACK</A></B> - 1970) and Mark has no other 
   choice but to give them the benefit of the doubt and let them into 
   the Argos, but when Keir steals an important piece of the Argos' 
   propulsion system, the only means of leaving this planet, Mark grabs 
   an escaping Captain Sallas and discovers that his chest is skinless, 
   exposing his ribcage. &quot;Captain Sallas&quot; says to Mark, <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;No,
    it's not Sallas, just his body. I inhabit the body of your late 
   captain and I'm just one of many beings on this planet. Many beings 
   who are desperate. We've been in trouble many years now and we're 
   fighting to survive. We arranged for several of you to kill each 
   other&nbsp; so that we could take over your bodies. You are our last 
   chance. It's imperative that our race continues to exist.&quot;</FONT></B>&nbsp;
    Mark asks, <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">&quot;At our expense?&quot;</FONT></B> 
   and the alien replies, <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;If you were in our 
   place, you would understand. On your planet, I know you humans have 
   fought and killed for centuries. Do you really expect us to be any 
   different? We cannot be wiped out. We'll stop at nothing, We must 
   fight, no matter how. We are a race that exists on a vibratory plane 
   different from yours. Our limitations are entirely different, our 
   technology. We cannot build anything, spaceships like this. We need 
   ships to get away. perhaps our survival is possible somewhere else.&quot;</FONT></B> 
   Wess asks the aliens if they tried this before (luring people in with 
   a fake SOS message) and he says yes. Sanya then realizes that the 
   alien ship she and Mark were just in were also victims of this alien 
   race. Mark says, <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">&quot;We'll never submit to 
   a breed of parasites!&quot;</FONT></B>, but the alien says it won't 
   be parasitical, it will be symbiotic. In any case they have no 
   choice; either everyone, both alien and human, goes back to Earth or 
   no human goes, at least not alive. The alien gives them a choice: Die 
   on this planet or they will return the propulsion unit and everyone 
   can leave for Earth. Mark promises that will never happen, telling 
   the alien that they will sacrifice themselves to save their race. 
   When the alien hears that, it vacates Captain Sallas' body, so Mark 
   comes up with a plan to save themselves and the human race. Can he 
   pull it off? More importantly, can Mark kill his own brother, even 
   though he's no longer human? Watch the film to get the answers to 
   those questions. You may be surprised.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    It should come as no surprise that this colorful and very 
   atmospheric science fiction/horror film was directed and co-written 
   by Mario Bava, who practically invented the bright, gel-colored 
   lighting we see in this film, seen in such previous films as <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackSabbath1963">BLACK
    SABBATH</A></B> (1963) and <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#BloodBlackLace1964">BLOOD
    AND BLACK LACE</A></B> (1964). Since Bava started his career as a 
   cinematographer, which Antonio Rinaldi (Bava's <B><A HREF="knives_of_the_avenger_1966.htm">KNIVES
    OF THE AVENGER</A></B> - 1966) is credited here, it contains Bava's 
   patented touches, including the opening shot, where the camera glides 
   across the floor of the Argos' large Control Room, so you know you 
   are in for a special treat, something the likes you have never seen 
   before. The entire film is a visual treat and many of the effects are 
   done in-camera, whether it be the use of mirrors (&quot;The Schufftan 
   Process&quot;), forced perspective shots, the use of miniatures or 
   all three in the same shot, making this film a once-in-a-lifetime 
   experience you will not soon forget. The sets are no different than 
   what you would see in an episode of TV's <B><A HREF="star_trek_1966.htm">STAR
    TREK</A></B> (1966 - 1969), , but they are given the &quot;Bava 
   Touch&quot;, using fog and gel lighting (red being the primary color) 
   to give every set an eerie and creepy feel. And Bava doesn't skimp on 
   the blood and gore, either (especially for 1965), as the dead bodies 
   we see in the Galliot are covered in the red stuff (excised from 
   prints when shown on TV as <B>THE DEMON PLANET</B> in the '60s &amp;<A HREF="planet_of_the_vampires_1965.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/planet of the vampires italy poster small2a.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="214" HEIGHT="308" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   '70s). The aliens rising from their steel graves is another sequence 
   not easily forgotten, as it gave me nightmares when watching it as a 
   kid on TV. The screenplay, by Bava, Ib Melchior (director/writer of <B><A HREF="angry_red_planet_1959.htm">THE
    ANGRY RED PLANET</A></B> [1959] and screenwriter of <B><A HREF="reptilicus_1961.htm">REPTILICUS</A></B> 
   [1961] and <B><A HREF="journey_to_the_seventh_planet_1961.htm">JOURNEY
    TO THE SEVENTH PLANET</A></B> [1961]), Alberto Bevilacqua (<B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#AtomAgeVampire1960">ATOM
    AGE VAMPIRE</A></B> - 1960), Callisto Cosulich, Antonio Roman and 
   Rafael J. Salvia, based on Renato Pestriniero's short story &quot;One 
   Night Of 21 Hours&quot;, may not seem like much today, but back in 
   1965 it was totally original, with an ending that doesn't offer much 
   hope for the human race. Mario Bava once again proves that he was 
   easily Italy's top director of genre films, whether it be Horror, 
   Science Fiction, Peplum, Giallo, Western or Fantasy. All you have to 
   do is look him up on IMDb to see for yourself what he gave us and how 
   it influenced those who came after him, especially the aforementioned <B><A HREF="alien_1979c.htm">ALIEN</A></B> 
   (1979), even if director Ridley Scott denies it (but screenwriter Dan 
   O'Bannon doesn't!). Everything in this film is first rate, including 
   the costumes (which would be &quot;borrowed&quot; for other Italian 
   science fiction flicks), the acting, the photography, the set designs 
   and, especially, the atmosphere, which is so thick it would take the 
   sharpest knife in the drawer to cut through it. This is also the 
   first film that Bava's son, Lamberto Bava (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#BladeInDark1983">A
    BLADE IN THE DARK</A></B> - 1983), worked on with his father, as 
   &quot;Assistant To The Director&quot;, his first film credit. Those 
   who admire Bava's sense of style and use of color will love this 
   film. So should those who have no idea who Mario Bava is. It's just a 
   great film.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   sabotage, but Professor Miller (Peter Dane; <B><A HREF="violent_city_1970.htm">VIOLENT

   happened, all of them showing someone who looks like Robert Landersen 
   is at every site. What is strange is that the failed rocket launches 
   in Cape Canaveral and Atomgrad happened at the very same time on the 
   very same day. How can one man be in two places at the same time, 
   thousands of miles apart? Professor Miller says we must find this 
   unknown man to discover what he is up to and everyone agrees. The 
   worldwide manhunt is on.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Meanwhile, Professor Giorgio Borri (Jacopo Tecchi) has invented a 
   new gas that, with just a very small amount, can paralyze an entire 
   city for two or three days (We see him test the gas on a monkey, who 
   instantly freezes in place once it sniffs the gas). The Professor's 
   fiancee, Marina Ferri (Maria Pia Luzi; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#WomenCellBlock71973">WOMEN
    IN CELL BLOCK 7</A></B> - 1973), is about to become a pawn in a 
   deadly game of cat and mouse, as &quot;Robert&quot; and his unknown 
   mission seems to be to get close to Marina in order for him to steal 
   the Professor's paralyzing gas. But why? It's obvious that Robert 
   isn't Robert at all, as he acts inhuman, seldom speaks, has eyes that 
   seem to look through people and wears black leather gloves in the 
   middle of Summer. We then see Professor Borri and Marina sitting 
   poolside with Marina's best friend, Audrey Bradbury (Jany Clair; <B><A HREF="hercules_against_the_moon_men_1964.htm">HERCULES
    AGAINST THE MOON MEN</A></B> - 1964), a painter of portraits who is 
   kind of whorish and likes her alcohol, maybe a little too much. 
   Audrey begins hitting on a total stranger, Major Michelotti (Otello 
   Toso), who will become a major figure in trying to capture the 
   stranger. He rebuffs Audrey's sexual advances when he gets an 
   important phone call and has to leave. &quot;Pity, another 
   disappointment&quot;, says the drunk Audrey about the Major, who then 
   begins putting down Professor Borri's sexual prowess, as well as his 
   profession as a biologist, until he gets up and leaves, but not 
   before saying this: &quot;Audrey, give up the gin. Alcohol's killed 
   off better painters than you. That's biological.&quot; When the 
   Professor hails a cab, Major Michelotti steals it from him and tells 
   the driver to take him to the Ministry of Defense.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next day, Audrey is sketching a streetwalker's portrait on the 
   side of the road, when she notices &quot;Robert&quot; standing on a 
   bridge staring intently at the water. She begins to sketch his 
   portrait, when he notices, walking up to her and saying, &quot;Did 
   you ask me for my portrait?&quot;. He then grabs the sketch, tears it 
   into pieces and throws it to the ground. Instead of being mad, Audrey 
   gets turned on and introduces herself. They both leave in her car 
   when the police arrive to bust all the streetwalkers, but the 
   prostitute Audrey was sketching picks up the pieces of Robert's 
   sketch and puts them in her pocketbook, which will soon prove to be 
   an important clue in discovering Robert's true identity. In Audrey's 
   car, Robert introduces himself as &quot;Bronco&quot; (which is what I 
   will call him in the rest of the review) and Audrey, being a whore, 
   tells Bronco, &quot;I rarely meet anyone as special as you. Your eyes 
   have a mystery I want to unravel. I want to find out why it is you're 
   afraid. In bed, of course.&quot; (Wow, she's only known him for less 
   than five minutes and she's already mentioning sex!&nbsp; Did I tell 
   you she's a whore?). Audrey drives Bronco to her studio so she can 
   &quot;paint his portrait.&quot; Is that how they say &quot;getting 
   laid&quot; in 1962?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see all the busted streetwalkers in a detective's office 
   complaining about being arrested for doing the community a service. 
   The prostitute shows the detective the pieces of the sketch she 
   picked up and tells him Audrey Bradbury drew it, thinking it will 
   help her case. When the detective puts the pieces together, he 
   noticed it looks like the photo of the man every law enforcement 
   agency in the world is looking for. He phones Police headquarters and 
   talks to Captain Carloni (Marco Guglielmi; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#MillStoneWomen1960">MILL
    OF THE STONE WOMEN</A></B> - 1960), the person in charge of the case 
   in Italy. He tells Captain Carloni about Audrey Bradbury driving the 
   man away and he tells the detective he will take care of it. Now they 
   have a solid lead; an address to look for Bronco, so they issue a 
   nameless officer (Piero Palermini; <B><A HREF="gambling_city_1975.htm">GAMBLING
    CITY</A></B> - 1975) and his equally nameless partner a video camera 
   (one that gives us the most unusual angles and POV shots without any 
   editing!) and stake out Audrey's studio, under orders just to keep 
   track of the man and not to interfere with him (they have no idea 
   this man looks like Robert Landersen or that he calls himself 
   Bronco). In her studio, Audrey hits on Bronco, wondering why the 
   expression on his face never changes. She says to Bronco, &quot;Tell 
   me, what Earth do you inhabit? Never had a drop of whiskey, never 
   heard of the black market or the police? I must know your mystery. I 
   just need more time.&quot; Bronco tells her time is precious for him, 
   not explaining why. Bronco then stares at a fish bowl and we see the 
   water instantly boil, killing the goldfish. Bronco admires Audrey's 
   portrait of Marina and asks if she is married. A visibly hurt Audrey 
   says Marina is &quot;pretty, rich and wouldn't appeal to you.&quot; 
   Audrey tells Bronco that she's invited to a huge party tonight and 
   she knows that Marina will be there, asking Bronco to come to the 
   party with her. Audrey and Bronco go to the party, with the two 
   officers following them with the video camera, which Bronco spots 
   immediately (How in the world do they get the shot of Audrey and 
   Bronco in the front seat, shot through the car's front window??? The 
   video camera, apparently, also has a live satellite feed connection 
   so Captain Carloni and Major Michelotti can watch it at Police 
   Headquarters!). The party is a typical la dolce vita Italian 
   get-together, complete with butlers and a drunk man who strips naked 
   and uses a swing to jump in the pool (we see nothing, just hear it). 
   As soon as Bronco spots Marina, he ditches Audrey and hypnotizes 
   Marina with his eyes. They then hop in Marina's car (Apparently, 
   every woman in Italy drives a convertible sports car!) and, without 
   speaking (talking directly to Marina's mind), Bronco tells her to 
   take him to Professor Borri's workplace. After Bronco kills two swans 
   in a pond by simply looking at them (!), Marina tries takes Bronco 
   there, but they are stopped by police officers who didn't get the 
   message not to interfere. As one of the officers walks up to the 
   passenger side of Marina's car, Bronco removes the black leather 
   glove from his right hand and touches the officer, killing him 
   immediately and turning him into nothing but a burned skeleton when 
   Captain Carloni and Major Michelotti get to the scene (Marina and 
   Bronco speed away from the scene when the officer is killed). Tests 
   on the officer's skeleton prove he died from a massive dose of 
   radiation. Yes, Bronco is radioactive, but is he human?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A series of circumstances allow the police to take an x-ray of 
   Bronco's body, revealing that he is not human, he's a cyborg! (Even 
   though the film never utters the word &quot;cyborg&quot;, I believe 
   this is the first film to depict them). Professor Miller then appears 
   at the U.N. and tells everyone his theory (telling everyone that a 
   UFO shot down Professor Landersen's plane and stole Robert's body to 
   make duplicate robots in his image; and then after showing a 
   slideshow of real photos of human deformities caused by the atomic 
   bombing of Hiroshima!). He believes there is more than one Bronco, 
   which explains how he could be in two places at the same time. The 
   Professor goes on to say that he believes that aliens have put 
   cyborgs on Earth to disable our plans to explore outer space, by 
   destroying all our launch facilities around the globe. The Professor 
   also believes that this cyborg is in Italy to steal Professor Borri's 
   paralyzing gas, so the aliens can put all humanity to sleep while 
   they conquer our planet and when we wake up, we will discover we are 
   slaves to the aliens. All the dignitaries of the world instantly 
   believe him (!),&nbsp; so they come up with a plan to destroy Bronco 
   by using Professor Borri and his gas as a trap. Audrey pays for her 
   whorishness, as Bronco returns to her studio and, as she tries to 
   kiss him, Bronco removes a glove and touches her, turning Audrey into 
   a skeleton (using stop-motion animation), as she falls on her bed and 
   then evaporates into thin air, leaving nothing but a black skeleton 
   stain on her sheets. Bronco once again hypnotizes Marina and makes 
   her drive him to Professor Borro's laboratory. Marina does it, but 
   she passes out due to being exposed to Bronco's radiation (Not helped 
   when she kisses him on the lips! Are all Italian women whores?) So, 
   will the aliens win or will we defeat them? Marina's no help because 
   when she is hospitalized for acute radiation poisoning, she loses her 
   memory and the doctor says it is permanent (being a whore does have 
   its drawbacks!). Bronco is defeated when a Special Services Agent 
   (Osvaldo Ruggieri; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#WerewolfWoman1976">WEREWOLF
    WOMAN</A></B> - 1976) shoots him in the stomach with a weapon we 
   have never seen before. An injured Bronco kills the Agent by touching 
   him with a gloveless hand, steals the Agent's car, where the Agent's 
   two young sons are sitting in the backseat! A deteriorating Bronco 
   leads Captain Carloni and Major Michelotti on a car chase (the two 
   young boys in the backseat don't seem sad at all that they just saw 
   their father killed, telling Bronco to step on it!), where Bronco 
   crashes into a light pole (after letting the two boys go free. Damn!) 
   and a UFO overhead shoots a ball of light into the car, turning 
   Bronco into a mass of melted metal.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Then, the most unbelievable thing happens, something you don't see 
   very often in films of this type. Professor Miller appears on screen 
   and delivers a monologue, which begins, <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;No
    gentlemen, Bronco is finished, but our struggle has only begun. 
   Other terrifying beings, not much different than Bronco, are all

   while saying, <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;Even at this moment, this

    I must confess, I hated this film when watching it as a kid on TV in 
   the '60s because it offered nothing for a young child's mind. As an 
   adult, however, I can see that it drips with sensuality and 
   sexuality, being much more adult that any science fiction film from 
   1962 should be, but nothing surprises me anymore, especially if it 
   comes from Italy. This black &amp; white film is crazy to the 
   extreme, thanks to the gonzo performance by Michel Lemoine (<B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#CastleCreepFlesh68">CASTLE

    Not that this is a good film, far from it. Director Romano Ferrara, 
   who has done nothing else of note, paces this film like it's a snail 
   race. It's very slow, as it seems to be just a bunch of talking heads 
   relentlessly discussing not much of anything. It really doesn't pick 
   up until Bronco takes center stage. The effects in the film are also 
   very low tech, including a UFO (full of duplicate Broncos) that makes 
   the one in Ed Wood's <B><A HREF="plan_nine_from_outer_space_1959.htm">PLAN

    OF THE BODY SNATCHERS</A></B> [1956]). I must say that Bronco's 
   stop-motion disintegration of his chest and stomach, even though done 
   very low-rent, was still enjoyable and is even a little gory, as it 
   comes out of left field and is somewhat graphic for people not 
   expecting it (it was also edited out of the TV prints, depriving kids 
   of the film's only enjoyment to be had in their young brains). 
   Bronco's intense interest in water (i.e. standing on a bridge looking 
   down at it; the killing of goldfish and swans) is quite mysterious 
   and never explained. The screenplay, by Ferrara and Piero Pierotti 
   (Mario Bava's <B><A HREF="erik_the_conqueror_1961.htm">ERIK THE CONQUEROR</A></B>

   scare and copies many of the films that played on that fear, but like 
   I said earlier in the review, this is the first film I can remember 
   that dealt with cyborgs and, for that reason, it may have its place 
   in science fiction film history. While I won't recommend it, I will 
   say this: it's enjoyable if you are in the right frame of mind.

   (supplied by the aliens) and throws the body parts into the light in 
   the cave, which is actually a portal to the aliens' home planet. Buck 
   (Martin Landau), the town's sheriff, is stumped by the cattle 
   mutilations (all photos taken of the mutilations are fogged), 
   especially since all the cattle are owned by the town's hotheaded 
   patriarch Walt (Neville Brand), who wants results quickly. When the 
   bodies of two tourists from a nearby dude ranch are found mutilated 
   (by the prospector after they caught him carving up cattle), some 
   stupid townspeople, led by Walt's idiotic son Eddie (Brad Reardon), 
   blame Jennifer and her fancy electronic equipment for the 
   mutilations. Wayne saves her from the mob mentality (and possible 
   rape) and brings her to his home, which is full of books on UFOs and 
   alien abductions. That's when they both realize that they were the 
   two kids on the street 25 years ago and they fall in love. Jennifer's 
   father figures out that the mysterious flashing marker is a star map 
   telling us when the aliens plan to return and it's going to be 
   tonight. What do the aliens want and why are they returning? It all 
   has to do with Jennifer, Wayne and the prospector and ends on a 
   metaphysical note.&nbsp; This film is one strange bird. I remember 
   first viewing this on a late night TV showing in the early 80's and 
   thinking the next morning that I must have dreamed it. I did finally 
   manage to get my hands on a VHS tape of it and am glad I did. Most of 
   the gore was missing from the TV print (a lot of it involving 
   Schiavelli and his laser saw, including Neville Brand's facial 
   reconstruction and Martin Landau's arm removal) but, even without the 
   gore, this film is hard to categorize. This film holds a fond place 
   in my heart and, even though it's by no means a good film, it's an 
   interesting one that manages to hold your attention throughout. The 
   screenplay (by genre vets Ken &amp; Jim Wheat and Curtis Burch) 
   throws a lot of ideas into the mix and, while not all of them 
   register, it still does have it's moments. This is my favorite 
   Greydon Clark film. He made <B><A HREF="#WithoutWarning1979">WITHOUT WARNING</A></B>

    NINJA</A><A NAME="RobotNinja"></A> (1989) -</B> Nerdy comic book 
   artist Leonard Miller (Michael Todd) is not a happy camper. It seems 
   television producers have bought the rights to his serious comic book 
   superhero, Robot Ninja, and turned it into a campy TV series, just 
   like the <B><A HREF="batman_1966.htm">BATMAN</A></B> show in the 60's 
   (that show's Robin, Burt Ward, puts in an extended cameo here). While 
   driving home one night, Leonard spots a trio of hooligans raping and 
   robbing a young couple and he tries to intervene. Leonard ends up 
   getting the couple killed (the woman gets her jaw blown-off with a 
   shotgun and the man is repeatedly stabbed in the throat) and he is 
   sent to the hospital, bloody and bruised. Leonard decides to use this 
   experience for a new Robot Ninja strip, but Leonard's publisher, 
   Stanley Kane (Ward), thinks it is much too dark and will turn-off 
   viewers of the TV series. A rash of killings in Leonard's town 
   (Ridgway, Ohio) prompts Leonard to have his friend, Dr. Hubert 
   Goodknight (Bogdan Pecic), build him a real Robot Ninja suit, which 
   Leonard means to wear while he fights crime, using his exploits as 
   plots for his comic strip. Leonard drives around town at night 
   wearing the suit (which is nothing but a black body suit with some 
   throwing stars sewn on the shoulde<A HREF="robot_ninja_1989b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/robot ninja vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="134" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>rs)
    and listening to a police radio, waiting for crime to occur. 
   Wouldn't you know it? The same trio that put him in the hospital are 
   robbing a video store, so Leonard, or rather, Robot Ninja, catches 
   them coming out of the video store and kills one of them (by stabbing 
   him in the eyes with specially-made blades that are attached to his 
   forearm), but a young boy is also killed in the process. To make a 
   very long, drawn-out story short, Leonard becomes an obsessed 
   pill-popping superhero who forgets what being a superhero is all 
   about. After being seriously wounded, Leonard leads the gang back to 
   the home of Dr. Goodknight. The gang kills Dr. Goodknight (in the 
   film's gore highlight), which leads Leonard to don the Robot Ninja 
   costume one last time. After disposing of the rest of the gang, a 
   mortally-wounded Leonard stumbles home and commits suicide with a 
   bullet to his brain. The finale shows that there's an upside to 
   killing yourself: Leonard's Robot Ninja comics, especially his last 
   one, makes Stanley Kane a rich man.&nbsp; This undeniably amateurish, 
   though extremely gory, sci-fi horror film was the second directorial 
   effort by one-man ultra-low-budget auteur J.R. Bookwalter, made a 
   short time after is first (and still best) film, <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Dead Next Door">THE
    DEAD NEXT DOOR</A></B> (1989). As with most of Bookwalter's films (<B><A HREF="ozone_1993.htm">OZONE</A></B> 
   - 1993; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Sandman">THE SANDMAN</A></B> - 
   1996), the scope of his ambitions are too much for his amateur casts, 
   meager budgets and lack of real talent to pull it off. <B><A HREF="robot_ninja_1989.htm">ROBOT
    NINJA</A></B> just ambles along at a snail's pace, tossing in a gory 
   kill every few minutes (including a pistol jammed into an eye socket 
   before being discharged; a face being kicked-in until it collapses 
   like a rotting pumpkin; a man pulling out his intestines; various 
   limbs being hacked off; and lots of stabbings). I guess that if your 
   only interest is gore, this film is a pretty safe bet, but I like my 
   films to have something more than blood and guts to hold my interest. 
   Unfortunately, this film has nothing but bad acting (and characters 
   have names like Spinell, Cameron, DePalma, Hickox, O'Bannon and such, 
   just to let us know how hip Bookwalter is as a scripter), not one 
   single sympathetic character, a droning synthesizer score (also by 
   Bookwalter) and fight scenes that look like they were choreographed 
   by Stevie Wonder. Besides Burt Ward, there are cameos by Linnea 
   Quigley, David DeCoteau (<B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Leeches">LEECHES</A></B> 
   - 2003; also this film's Executive Producer), Kenneth J. Hall (<B><A HREF="evil_spawn_1987.htm">THE

   - 1989), doing his best Jerry Lewis impression. Bookwalter tries to 
   be different by making the chief bad guy a woman (Maria Markovic), 
   but she's so butch, she's indistinguishable from any man in the cast. 
   Toss in headache-inducing handheld camerawork (about 90% of the film) 
   and absolutely no nudity (the women keep their bras and panties in 
   while being raped) and <B><A HREF="robot_ninja_1989c.htm">ROBOT NINJA</A></B>

    that some of them are robots (called &quot;Untouchables&quot;), Rush 
   is captured and brought back to the compound. When it is discovered 
   that Rush is not contaminated by radiation, Yor has him locked up and 
   tortured out of fear that if his slaves learn that it is actually 
   safe to leave the compound without becoming contaminated, they will 
   revolt. Rush is eventually put to work at the compound's nursery, 
   where old timer Homer (Osiride Pevarello) teaches him how to plant 
   seeds in radioactive soil without being exposed. Rush catches the eye 
   of pretty kitchen worker Carol (Laura Trotter; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#City Walking Dead">CITY

   Rush also make enemies with the nursery's alpha male, Steel (Richard

   some guards, Rush is chained to a concrete column, where Yor sends 
   his chief interrogator Lorna (Rita Furlan) to use her womanly ways to 
   find out where Rush lives on the outside. Rush almost falls for the 
   ruse, but Carol convinces him to lead a revolt out of the compound 
   with the help of Steel and Homer. Rush also needs to get revenge on 
   Yor for previously killing his brother and freezing his body (this 
   plot point suddenly comes out of nowhere and really makes no sense at 
   whatsoever). Rush, Steel and Homer lead a violent escape out of the 
   compound, but only Rush makes it out alive (Steel is shot dead and 
   Homer blows himself up with a grenade when he is surrounded by 
   guards). Rush is hunted down by Yor and his men (he even has a run-in 
   with a mutant rat!), but he uses his Rambo-like training (including 
   forest booby-traps and a runaway tractor) to avoid capture. Rush 
   steals a Jeep and returns to the compound to save Carol (he manages

   by a brown dust caused by a catastrophic volcanic eruption in Japan, 
   putting the world in endless darkness, called 
   &quot;Econight&quot;.&nbsp; At a penal colony on the Moon, psychotic 
   prisoner Adrian Dunn (Billy Drago) kills another prisoner for 
   stealing one of his cigarettes. He then purposely infects himself 
   with an alien organism, which gives him the appearance of being dead. 
   His body is then shipped back to Earth for burial, where he wakes up 
   and goes on a rape and murder spree. Adrian Dunn is beginning to 
   mutate into an alien lifeform and anyone he rapes is infected with a 
   highly contagious virus which begins spreading throughout the city. 
   Dr. Kirbie Younger (Jayne Heitmeyer), an infectious disease 
   specialist, is called in to investigate when one of Adrian's rape 
   victims, Tricia (Donna Sarrasin), becomes extremely ill and is 
   quarantined. A &quot;Black Shield&quot; police detective (the highest

   jealous rage and was sent to lunar prison. As the hours pass, Adrian 
   begins to mutate in an accelerated fashion, first losing his 
   fingernails as his fingers begin to fuse together. As his condition 
   begins to worsen, so does his rage and he begins to rape and murder 
   more women. When Trish's condition begins to look grim (she develops 
   tumors all over her body and seems to be exhaling methane gas), Dr. 
   Younger and Det. Grayson begin to work together to find Adrian before 
   his reign of terror becomes a fullblown epidemic. Trish's body 
   explodes in quarantine and spits forth alien organisms, one of which 
   attaches itself to Dr. Gene Washington (Tyrone Benskin), a good 
   friend of Dr. Younger. Dr. Washington seals off the room and uses 
   himself as a human guinea pig, transmitting his results to Dr. 
   Younger via close circuit TV. Grayson, meanwhile, has caught-up with 
   Adrian and finds out quickly that bullets are useless. Adrian sets 
   his sights on Dr. Younger, who bears a striking resemblance to Katy 
   (even Grayson notices it), so it's up to Det. Grayson to keep her 
   safe. He fails on several occasions to do so, which sets the stage

   stomach-bursting scene; several bloody murders) and some truly 
   head-scratching scenes, such as Adrian's murder weapon of choice: A 
   golden penis-shaped dildo with a spring-loaded blade. There's also a

   would argue too restrained (no wrestling moves here, just plenty of 
   gunfights). The film is a little too leisurely-paced for it's own

   Grayson that the newest rape victim in the hospital hasn't 
   &quot;exploded yet&quot;, the look on Piper's face is priceless). The

    may have something to do with Cameron's influence. As the year 2000 
   approaches, the city of Venice, Italy has become a polluted mess. 
   Something strange has happened to a secret underground facility 
   beneath the city as all communications to the outside have been 
   cut-off except for one last transmission by a scientist who begs for 
   a rescue. The Tubular Corporation sends a squad of Marines called the 
   MegaForce, led by Samuel Fuller (Cristofer Ahrens), to breach the 
   underground facility and retrieve a diary by a scientist who was 
   performing top secret experiments. Almost as soon as they are 
   underground, the MegaForce run into a scientist who has been infected 
   with an alien lifeform, whose scream temporarily paralyzes everyone. 
   As they delve further underground, they discover alien lifeforms and 
   humans who are encased in alien goo who beg the MegaForce, 
   &quot;Please kill me!&quot; They even find a little girl named 
   Samantha (Doninica Coulson), who a female member of the force becomes 
   attached to. Uh, oh! I think I know where this is going. It's not 
   long before members of the MegaForce are killed by rampaging aliens 
   and we also find out that the Tubular Corporation has a hidden agenda 
   and does not want anyone coming back alive. See if you can spot who 
   plays the Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen and Paul 
   Reiser characters in this. It's really not hard at all. This is one 
   of Bruno Mattei's (here using his pseudonym &quot;Vincent Dawn&quot;) 
   &quot;homages&quot; to American blockbuster films of the 80's (see <B><A HREF="#Robowar">ROBOWAR</A></B> 
   above). Besides a few minor plot changes, this is nearly an exact 
   copy of <B>ALIENS</B> that veers off into <B>TERMINATOR</B> territory 
   in the finale as the last two survivors are chased by a cyborg and 
   there's even a time machine! I doubt <B>ALIENS</B> has dialogue like, 
   &quot;If I'd known Wops were coming along, I would have brought my 
   anti-grease spray!&quot;, though. Unredeemingly cheap in it's 
   execution, <B><A HREF="shocking_dark_1989b.htm">SHOCKING DARK</A></B> 
   looks like it was shot in a huge boiler room and you never see more 
   than one alien on the screen at the same time. That's probably 
   because they could only afford one costume. The actors are all pretty 
   bad (especially Geretta Giancarlo Field as Kuster, the Black female 
   member of the squad, who spouts the most racist dialogue here, 
   including the previously-mentioned &quot;Wop&quot; comment), as all 
   they do is scream at each other and try to forget that English is 
   their second language. You'll want to reach through the screen and 
   strangle Samantha, as all she seems to scream is &quot;SARA!&quot; at 
   the top of her little lungs. If I had a shotgun, I would have blown 
   her head off and said I had mistaken her for an alien. Still, it's 
   good cheesy fun, with dollops of gore, unbelievable wooden dialogue 
   and so many &quot;spot the rip-off&quot; moments that you can make a 
   drinking game of it. The only problem is that you'll be hammered by 
   the 30 minute mark and probably not remember the rest of the film. 
   Maybe that's a good thing. Also starring Haven Tyler, Tony Lombardo, 
   Mark Steinborn and Italian exploitation staple Alex McBride. The copy

   post-nuke time again and you know what that means: Lots of gun 
   battles, chases and explosions with the barest of plots to hold it 
   all together. Two women, Alee (Rebecca Holden) and Vera (Barbara 
   Hooper), members of a group of legendary Amazons called The 
   Sisterhood, travel on horseback through the scorched post-apocalyptic 
   landscape on a rescue miss<A HREF="sisterhood_1988b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sisterhood vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ion.
    They are one their way to free their fellow Sisters from 
   imprisonment by the evil Lord Kragg (Kenneth Peerless), who is 
   holding them in a dungeon and plans on using them for world 
   domination. You see, each member of the Sisterhood has a magical 
   power, like the ability to shoot laser beams from their eyes or heal 
   wounds with the touch of a hand, so Lord Kragg figures on using their 
   powers to defeat all the other nomadic tribes on Earth. Alee and Vera 
   are being followed by warrior Mikal (Chuck Wagner) and his men. Mikal 
   wants Vera, since she has the power to heal. With her by his side, he 
   cannot be killed in any battle he's in. Mikal and his raiders destroy 
   a village and he kills the young brother of stablegirl Marya 
   (Lynn-Holly Johnson), who has the ability to speak with her pet hawk. 
   Marya joins forces with Alee and Vera and she swears to get even with 
   Mikal for her brother's death. As the female trio are on their way to 
   free the Sisterhood, Vera is captured by Mikal, so Alee and Marya 
   work together to rescue her. Mikal and his men bring Vera to a camp 
   run by the evil Lord Jak (Anthony East), where Mikal joins forces 
   with Jak and his men. Alee and Marya have a run-in with a caravan led 
   by Lord Barak (Robert Dryer), but Barak turns out not to be such a 
   bad guy and everyone settles their differences amicably. Alee and 
   Marya then run into a tribe of horribly-scarred scarred mutants and, 
   as they are fleeing from the mutant horde, they find a cave that 
   contains a bunker full of automatic weapons, explosives and an 
   armored vehicle that has been sitting there before the &quot;Great 
   War&quot; between the United States and Russia (talk about a stroke 
   of good luck!). Alee and Marya use their new wealth of goodies to 
   first free Vera and then head-off to save the rest of the Sisterhood. 
   As the trio storms the village where the Sisterhood is being held 
   captive, Mikal discovers that one of them is actually his sister! The 
   mystical female goddess of the Sisterhood appears in the finale to 
   unshackle all the women and transport them to safety, away from the 
   cold hands of the male population. Mikal follows them on his chopper, 
   the only man who has the Sisterhood's best interest at heart (I guess 
   Marya has given up on making him pay for her brother's death. Maybe 
   she just forgot.).&nbsp; Yes, this is another of prolific Filipino 
   director/producer Cirio H. Santiago's 80's post-nuke flicks <A HREF="sisterhood_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sisterhood dutch vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="156" HEIGHT="232" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(which

   - 1986) and, yes, it doesn't make a lick of sense but, damn, it sure 
   is entertaining in an absurd, brain-dead sort of way. Santiago 
   creates his own future Earth where spears, swords and horses co-exist 
   with guns, rocket launchers and armored personnel carriers. Each has 
   their place in this futuristic society and each has their advantage. 
   Unlike most post-nuke films (including the remainder of Santiago's), 
   this one doesn't concern itself with oil or water or a lack thereof. <B><A HREF="sisterhood_1988.htm">THE
    SISTERHOOD</A></B> is about a battle of the sexes. In this future 
   society, women fall into two distinct categories: They are either sex 
   slaves or strong-willed, independent individuals. No gray areas here; 
   everything is either black or white. Of course, this being a Santiago 
   film, both types of women spend a lot of time in various states of 
   undress, except for the chaste Lynn-Holly Johnson (<B><A HREF="alien_predators_1984.htm">ALIEN
    PREDATORS</A></B> - 1984), who never seems to take her clothes off 
   in any film she's in (I'm beginning to think she's actually a man!). 
   Robert Dryer (Santiago's <B><A HREF="action.htm#FastGun">FAST GUN</A></B> 
   and <B><A HREF="action.htm#BehindEnemyLines87">BEHIND ENEMY LINES</A></B> 
   [both 1987]) takes the prize here as the weirdest character. His Lord 
   Barak speaks with a Boris Karloff-like lisp, which makes him seem 
   like a bad guy but, as we soon find out, he's a very reasonable man. 
   I also like the twisted logic used here (script by Thomas McKelvey 
   Cleaver, screenwriter of other Santiago epics like <B><A HREF="#DuneWarriors">DUNE
    WARRIORS</A></B> and <B><A HREF="action.htm#FieldOfFire">FIELD OF FIRE</A></B> 
   [both 1990]), especially concerning Mikal. Even though he murders 
   innocent people (including Marya's pre-teen brother), he's allowed to 
   live in the finale based solely on the revelation that Alee is his 
   sister. Innocent victims be damned! Santiago also offers some gore 
   (swordplay violence, various slashings and impalements and a hand 
   being lopped-off), lots of explosions and two of his trademarks: 
   pygmie cannibals and his patented &quot;running man on fire&quot; 
   gag. In other words, your typical Santiago action flick. If you like 
   his other films, you're bound to like this one, too. Also starring

   Here's a real rarity: A blood-soaked gore/slasher film with sci-fi 
   trappings. The fact that it took 4 years to complete makes my head 
   spin (the director has stated that making this film was akin to 
   having teeth pulled without the benefit of novocain!). I do have to 
   say that this film did keep me glued to the couch, even with loads of 
   bad CGI (that gets better as the film progresses). The film opens 
   with five women and one man crash-landing their spaceship on some 
   unknown planet (The reason why is never related to us. It just 
   happens.) and another space ship, piloted by the appropriaterly named 
   Captain Terror (Jay Wesley Cochran), who has butchered <A HREF="spaceship_terror_2011-2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/spaceship terror poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="174" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>and
    killed many people, including everyone on his ship (The opening 
   credits show his carnage, as we see human hands and feet on a table, 
   heads cut off at the jawline and human torsos hanging on the walls 
   and other gory sights, all very well done), lands to pick them up. 
   The crash survivors, Laura (Kristen Springer), Janet (Lacey Blair), 
   Annie (Ronda Olshefski), Mia (Yulia Hancheroff), Kelly (Jenny Lin) 
   and an injured Hardwick (Stephen Lestat) see Captain Terror's Ship 
   land (His name is never mentioned once in this film, but it lists him 
   as &quot;Captain Terror&quot; in the closing credits), and see it is 
   appropriately named &quot;TERROR&quot;. The hatch door opens and, 
   even though some of the women do not want to enter, Laura convinces 
   them to get inside, where the hatch slams shut and they are greeted 
   by Chris (Emma Lee Nguyen), who tells them &quot;You are on a death 
   ship. You're all going to die!&quot; and that she has been a prisoner 
   on this ship for over two years. She has been hiding out trying to 
   stay away from Captain Terror (A fat hulking bald man who talks in an 
   electronic voice and has a hose going up his nose), who can see 
   everything on his ship. It seems that Captain Terror likes to play a 
   game where he booby-traps the corridors of the ship and whenever 
   anyone dies, he give part of a keycode that will lead them to an 
   escape pod. The problem is that five people have to die before the 
   final number keycode sequence is completed and the survivor(s) have 
   to remember them in the sequence they were given within 5 minutes or 
   else he will re-program the code. Kelly said that she once was a 
   survivor of this deadly game, but she couldn't remember the keycode 
   in the proper sequence, so she couldn't get off the ship.&nbsp; 
   Captain Terror has two safe rooms that he will not enter and it 
   includes a dining area and a bathroom. As long as they stay in these 
   rooms, he will not kill them. What do you think these women do? Well, 
   Captain Terror breaks his promise and a rotating speargun comes out 
   of the ceiling and fires three metal arrows into Hardwick, pinning 
   him to a wall. He then has a spinning drill-like machine come through 
   the wall and it enters the back of Hardwick and comes out of his 
   chest, killing him. (In Captain Terror's defense, he didn't 
   personally show up to do the killing). Laura screams that this was 
   supposed to be a safe room and Captain Terror answers over the ship's 
   intercom, &quot;We play by my rules, not yours! I'm going to do 
   things to your bodies that you never dreamed of!&quot; Laura goes to 
   the safe bathroom and water begins pouring from a pipe into a bathtub 
   (It is very hot in both rooms) and Captain Terror makes Laura strip 
   naked and take a bath so he can watch (There is tons of female full 
   frontal nudity in this film, none of it titillating). He likes to 
   degrade the women. Chris tells the women that the Captain walks 
   around with a harpoon-like weapon, which he uses to impale his victim 
   to drag them to his torture chamber. Annie tries to escape, but has 
   her hand caught in a closing metal door. She manages to free herself, 
   but becomes the first victim of Captain Terror, who harpoons her on 
   the leg, drags her away and straps her-spread-eagle on a table 
   totally naked. He then opens up her stomach and puts a hose into the 
   opening where we can hear a sucking sound over her screams. He then 
   chops her to pieces with a hand axe. The other women decide to make a 
   rod-shooting gun (it does what it says) and Chris says she knows 
   where they can find the parts to make the weapon, so she and the rest 
   of the women head out of the safe room to where Chris leads them. 
   Kelly steps on a pressure plate in one of the corridors and a 
   spinning circular saw come outs of the wall and cuts her feet off at 
   the ankles (a good effect) and then she is dragged through a vent to 
   her doom. We see Captain Terror put the footless Kelly on a table and 
   he bites off one of her nipples (another disgustingly good effect). 
   Chris falls through an opening in one of the corridor's floor and we 
   see Captain Terror torturing her with electrical cables to her 
   breasts. Chris is then killed in another booby-trap when she is 
   crushed to a bloody pulp when a metal wall quickly closes in on her. 
   All the time someone is killed, Captain Terror give out two numbers 
   to the escape pod keycode, which Laura carves into her arm because 
   she doesn't have a pen! Mya is then dragged off by the murderous fat 
   man and has her throat graphically cut, which he proudly shows to a 
   still-alive (and<A HREF="spaceship_terror_2011-2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/spaceship terror dvd front2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="167" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   nippleless) Kelly. In a final bid to escape, Janet and Laura head off 
   to the escape pod, where Janet is harpooned by Captain Terror and 
   beheaded (a terrible CGI effect). He holds her head in his hand and 
   goes after Laura, but he wants to &quot;play&quot; with her a little 
   longer. Laura has all five code numbers (the last code is a trick on 
   a wall), but first she fires the homemade rod-shooting gun into 
   Captain Terror's neck. It doesn't stop him, so when he tries to stop 
   Laura from typing in the keycode, she impales him in the eye with her 
   last rod. She gets into the escape pod, but Captain Terror still 
   isn't dead. He tries to stop her from lifting off, but he is too late 
   (He says, &quot;I'm gonna rip your fucking tits off!&quot;). The 
   flames from the exhaust of the escape pod engulfs him and he is

   answered by a member of another ship, who tells her they will be in

   was nothing but a ghost ship? Jack-of all-trades 
   director/screenwriter/producer/editor/cinematographer/set 
   designer/art director Harry Tchinski (who also made <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BloodDemonRisn16">BLOOD
    DEMON RISING</A></B>, which took four years to make between the 
   years 2012 to 2016, using many of the same cast members in this film) 
   had financial difficulties on this film, which is why it took him 
   four years to make. You can spot different hair styles on many of the 
   female cast members over the four years, but the fact is this film 
   should fail wildly, but it doesn't. It is gory as hell and doesn't 
   shy away from the full monty. But most of the women are naked on 
   Captain Terror's torture table, so you would have to be a sick 
   bastard to find it in any way a sexual turn-on. The physical makeup 
   effects are very well done (most of them supplied by the director's 
   wife Wendy Tchinski and Doug Hudson, who both also do many more 
   behind-the-scenes duties). It won a STIFFY Award (Seattle True 
   Independent Film Festival) as &quot;Most Kickass Film&quot; in 2011 
   in the original first cut of the film. Time does fly while watching 
   this film (which I viewed streaming on Amazon Prime), even though it 
   is horrendously acted by nearly everyone in the cast, but if you look 
   past that, you will find a bloody good slasher film under the bad 
   layers. The sets are bare-bones, but well done (They look dirty and 
   blood-soaked, giving the film an extra edge). The feeling is 
   claustrophobic and the ambient soundtrack, which is full of women's 
   screams does put you in a paranoid state of mind (I watched it using 
   headphones on my Roku 3 player's remote). This is nothing 
   extraordinary, just a good time-waster that delivers on its promises. 
   I should hate this film, but I don't. A SGL Entertainment Blu-Ray and 
   DVD Release. <B>Not Rated</B> (and for good reason).</FONT></FONT></P>

    SECOND</A><A NAME="SplitSecond1992"></A> (1992) -</B> &quot;London: 
   2008. After forty days and nights of torrential rain, the city is 
   largely submerged below water, a result of the devastating effects of 
   continued global pollution where day has become almost endless 
   night...&quot; Damn! I guess Al Gore was correct all along. In this 
   futuristic sci-fi/horror/action flick, renegade cop Harley Stone 
   (Rutger Hauer), who has been suspended from the force, is on the 
   trail of a serial killer who murdered his partner three years 
   earlier. For some reason (which will be revealed later in the film), 
   Stone has a psychic link with the serial killer (who rips the hearts 
   out of his victims and eats them), but he is always one step behind. 
   Stone is reinstated back on the force with the provision that he 
   takes on a new partner, nerdy serial killer expert Detective Dick 
   Durkin (Neil Duncan). At first, their partnership works as well as 
   oil and water, but they will soon become to depend on each other's 
   talents in order to survive. The serial killer taunts Stone, 
   delivering a half-eaten heart to his precinct, leaving his dead 
   partner's gun at a crime scene and revealing a c<A HREF="split_second_1992b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/split second vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="136" HEIGHT="246" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ryptic
    clue at the latest murder scene: A drawing of the zodiac sign 
   Scorpio scrawled on the ceiling in the victim's blood. When Stone's 
   dead partner's wife, Michelle (Kim Cattrall), returns to London, she 
   and Stone reignite their passion for each other that started shortly 
   after her husband's death. Stone may be the only person to believe 
   that the serial killer may not be a man at all, but some kind of 
   genetic mutation brought on by years of global warning. Casts taken 
   from the bite marks of the delivered heart reveal that it couldn't 
   possibly come from a human being and the zodiac sign painted on the 
   ceiling shows that the killer may be ten feet tall! When the killer 
   bites Michelle and eventually kidnaps her, we find out why Stone has 
   a psychic link. He was mauled on the shoulder by the killer three 
   years earlier (the killer absorbs it's victim's DNA and memories) and 
   Stone can now sense when it is near. Stone and Durkin put their 
   differences aside and head down to the flooded London subway system 
   (after the creature carves a map on Durkin's chest!) to save Michelle 
   and kill the creature. It's a trap, of course, but Stone and Durkin 
   work together to destroy the creature. Or do they?&nbsp; This 
   fast-paced hybrid film, directed by Tony Maylam (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Burning 1980">THE
    BURNING</A></B> - 1980), is a fun and bloody ride, even if the 
   vision of future London has, by now, been proven wrong (Give it 
   another twenty years!). This is a very wet film in the sense that 
   there is water in nearly every scene, but it doesn't shy away from 
   the other &quot;wet&quot; aspect in this film: Blood. It flows rather 
   freely here, as hearts are ripped-out, bodies explode and there are 
   plenty of bloody gunfights. The gun blasts just don't enter bodies, 
   they go &quot;splat!&quot; The action sequences are exciting and 
   well-executed, especially the shootout in the morgue and the finale 
   in the flooded subway, which was directed by Ian Sharp (<B><A HREF="rpm_1998.htm">RPM</A></B>

   comic timing that brings a smile to the viewer's face, especially 
   Duncan's line &quot;We need bigger fucking guns!&quot; after catching 
   his first glimpse of the creature. There are many snappy lines in 
   Gary Scott Thompson's script. So many, in fact, it's worth repeat 
   viewings to truly appreciate them all. <B><A HREF="split_second_1992d.htm">SPLIT

   camp filmmaking of the highest order. Everything about this film 
   screams out camp, from the garish neon-lit sets, broad acting,

   (using forced perspective, laughable double exposures and jerky 
   stop-motion animation), outlandish costume designs (including some 
   revealing, skimpy outfits worn by the lovely Ms. Monro) and a future 
   society where everything is domed or bubble-shaped (the set designs 
   are a hoot). I was really taken aback by the appearance of the 
   usually dignified Christopher Plummer in a film of this caliber. I'm 
   sure this is one film he doesn't list on his resume, but he looks 
   like he's having a helluva time in the few scenes he's in. Both 
   Robert Tessier and Joe Spinell are dubbed by other voice-over 
   artists, but everyone else dubbed the film using their own voices. 
   David Hasselhoff wears so much makeup and eyeliner here, he looks 
   like a young Michael Des Barre. Most of the secondary space outfits 
   worn in <B><A HREF="starcrash_1979c.htm">STARCRASH</A></B> look to be 
   hand-me-downs from Mario Bava's <B><A HREF="#PlanetVampires1965">PLANET

   operas from the 70's, such as <B><A HREF="#Star Odyssey">STAR ODYSSEY</A></B> 
   (1978). The entire film is highly enjoyable, mostly for the wrong 
   reasons (I wonder how many pre-teen and teen boys pumped out knuckle 
   children to the sight of Caroline Munro in her skin-baring outfits?), 
   but it's always good for a hearty laugh (Count Zarth Arn's mothership 
   is shaped like a giant robot hand, complete with moveable fingers!). 
   In his own ridiculously low-budget way, Cozzi manages to pay tribute 
   not only to space films, but also to the movies of Ray Harryhausen 
   and a sly wink to the original <B><A HREF="invaders_from_mars_1953.htm">INVADERS

   (1979) clone snoozefest. In the year 2032, a crew exploring a crater 
   on Mars discovers a strange-looking rock and bring it on-board their 
   space shuttle. The rock splits open, spilling ooze on the floor and 
   exposing a light-pulsating crystal inside the shell. From the ooze, a 
   small alien creature begins to develop and the crystal shuts down all 
   the shuttle's power, including life support, killing the entire crew. 
   Two months later, the shuttle is found and docked at an orbiting 
   space station. A crew is assigned to go into the shuttle and 
   investigate the mysterious deaths. As soon as they are all on-board, 
   the shuttle suddenly takes off and the crew watches helplessly as the 
   space station explodes into a million pieces. The crew is now stuck 
   on this spacebound coffin, with minimal power, not enough food to 
   last more than a couple of months and a tentacled creature that likes 
   to snack on human blood. The creature begins killing the crew 
   one-by-one as they try to make their way back to Earth which, at the 
   rate of speed they are <A HREF="star_crystal_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/star crystal dvd insert small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>traveling,
    will take more than two years to reach. The creature kills all but 
   two members of the crew, Roger Campbell (C. Juston Campbell) and Dr. 
   Adrian Kimberly (Fay Bolt), and they go through the videotape logs of 
   the previous crew looking for clues on how to defeat the creature 
   (they don't find any, but it takes up a good portion of screen time). 
   It's apparent that the crystal has full control of the shuttle and 
   the creature has plans for the two surviving crew members. I really 
   became pissed-off when the creature began reading passages from the 
   Bible on the shuttle's computer screen. It is at this time I realized 
   I was actually watching an alien converting to Christianity. All the 
   flamethrowers, blood, gore and carnage in the world can't cover the 
   fact that the viewer was duped into watching this filmmaker's 
   religious beliefs disguised as a science fiction film, especially 
   when the bloodthirsty alien (a cross between <B><A HREF="et_the_extra_terrestrial_1982.htm">E.T.
    THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL</A></B> [1982] and <B><A HREF="blob_1958.htm">THE
    BLOB</A></B> [1958]) explains to the two surviving humans that he 
   didn't know the meaning of &quot;kill&quot; until he ran into our 
   species. After reading the Bible, he saw the error of his ways and 
   helps the two humans make it safely back to Earth, sacrificing his 
   own life in the process while a sappy love song plays on the 
   soundtrack (&quot;Crystal of the stars, tell me who you are...&quot;).
    Oh boy! Now I've truly seen it all.&nbsp; This sci-fi/horror film 
   contains some of the worst acting I have ever had the displeasure of 
   witnessing and sets that are so threadbare, a porn film seems lush by 
   comparison. This is one film you'll be rooting for the alien, as the 
   &quot;actors&quot; (and I use that term lightly) constantly bicker 
   with one another (&quot;You can't use that computer!&quot; <I>&quot;Why?&quot;&nbsp;
    </I>&quot;Because it only responds to my voice!&quot; <I>&quot;Well, 
   what happens if you are killed?&quot;</I>&nbsp; &quot;I didn't think 
   of that!&quot;) or do the exact opposite of what logic dictates. I 
   came very close to turning this film off a couple of times because 
   it's about as interesting as watching home movies of your cousin 
   Ricky being bathed as a baby. The special effects are anything but 
   (When Mars is shown in a shot in the beginning, it is transparent!) 
   and consists of grade school model effects, objects 
   &quot;floating&quot; on visible strings and creature effects that can 
   best be described as impoverished. The tentacle effects are achieved 
   by running the film backwards and what little gore there is shows the 
   tentacles sucking all the fluids out of the bodies, leaving 
   shriveled-up corpses (just like in Tobe Hooper's <B><A HREF="lifeforce_1985.htm">LIFEFORCE</A></B> 
   [1985], but in reverse). Director/scripter Lance Lindsay (who's only

   films). An alien race has attacked Earth (destruction scenes supplied 
   by stock WWII footage) and the military hires a ragtag group of 
   criminals and fuck-ups to infiltrate the alien base and defeat them. 
   The group includes master thief Dirk (who has hypnotic and 
   telekinetic powers) and military man Hollywood, named because of his 
   love of movies (he has the funniest pencil-<A HREF="star_odyssey_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/star odyssey vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="106" HEIGHT="175" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>thin
    moustache I have ever seen!). They stop at a prison on the Moon to 
   break out a man and a woman who have talents they will need to 
   complete their mission. Meanwhile, a group of alien races (consider 
   this the cantina scene) are at an auction where they are bidding for 
   rights to conquer and enslave planet Earth, which the auctioneer 
   states has &quot;millions and millions&quot; of slaves (and, in a 
   stroke of bad taste, they show stock shots of black people being 
   herded into groups, calling them &quot;dark-skinned units&quot;!). 
   The lizard-looking race of aliens wins the bid (for &quot;one hundred 
   million credits&quot;, which is a pretty good deal if you base it per 
   person) and begins their invasion of Earth. Confused yet? Not as 
   confused as you will be actually watching this disaster as it seems 
   to jump all around the place, having no sense of place or time. It 
   becomes apparent after a short while that Brescia patterned this film 
   after <B>STAR WARS, </B>where Hollywood is Luke Skywalker, Dirk is 
   Hans Solo, there's an old bald guy with psychic powers (and a very 
   large collar) that is Obi-Wan and the head lizard alien is Darth 
   Vader. There's even a female cast member that both Hollywood and Dirk 
   lust after (I wonder who she's trying to be?). You also view (and 
   probably cringe at) a pair of male and female robots (who tried to 
   commit suicide, but failed!) who are also added to the mission. The 
   female robot has curly eyelashes (!), they both have antennaes on the 
   top of their heads that look like the Star of David (!!) and they 
   both crack wise (just like C3PO). There's also an R2D2 thingamajig

   After the final nuclear holocaust, the Earth is a dry, scorched shell 
   and water is in short supply (Why does this sound so familiar?). 
   Whoever controls the water controls the world. Lone wolf Stryker 
   (Steve Sandor; <B><A HREF="trained_to_kill_usa_1973.htm">TRAINED TO 
   KILL U.S.A.</A></B> - 1973) saves a young woman named Delha (Andrea 
   Savio) from a pack of bandits, who are after her body and something 
   more important (more on that later). She pays Stryker back by 
   stealing his <B><A HREF="road_warrior_1982.htm">ROAD WARRIOR</A></B>-inspired
    car and taking off without him. He travels on foot with new pal 
   Bandit (William Ostrander; <B><A HREF="red_heat_1985.htm">RED HEAT</A></B> 
   - 1985), who was sent to retrieve Delha and bring her back to Trun 
   (Ken Metcalfe; <B><A HREF="action.htm#FastGun">FAST GUN</A></B> - 
   1987). After giving water to a tribe of dwarves, Stryker and Bandit 
   catch up with Delha (Stryker has a gas shut-off switch in hiis car), 
   only to watch her being taken away by the men commanded by the evil 
   Kardis (Michael Lane; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Code Name Zebra">CODE 
   NAME: ZEBRA</A></B> - 1986). It seems Kardis and Stryker have a 
   history, as flashbacks reveal that Kardis killed Stryker's wife years 
   earlier. Stryker was able to get some payback by chopping off Kardis' 
   left hand (he now sports a stylish hook in place of his hand), but 
   Kardis escaped before Stryker could finish him off. Delha knows the 
   secret location of an underground spring full of potable water and 
   both bad guy Kardis and good guy Trun would like to know where it is. 
   Stryker and Bandit steal one of Kardis' water<A HREF="stryker_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/stryker vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   trucks and use it as a diversion to sneak into Kardis' compound. 
   Kardis, who's compound is running out of water (He cuts back on water 
   rations to his own men and completely cuts-off rations to his 
   wounded, declaring, &quot;Water is only for those that are 
   productive!&quot;), tortures Delha for the location of the water 
   (three of his men strip and rape her), but before she can say 
   anything, Stryker and Bandit save her and escape. This, of course, 
   pisses-off Kardis to no end. Stryker and Bandit take Delha to Trun's 
   camp (Turns out Trun and Stryker are brothers), but when they get 
   there, they find that Trun has been kidnapped by Kardis' men (we 
   watch one of Kardis' henchmen, played by an uncredited Nick 
   Nicholson, piss on Trun's face as he's buried up to his neck in the 
   sand). Stryker and Bandit lead a raid on the remote outpost and not 
   only save Trun, they also save the tribe of dwarves we met earlier in 
   the film and get some unexpected help from a tribe of 
   crossbow-weilding female Amazons. The Amazons are actually protecting 
   the secret spring (which is located in a remote cave) and once Delha 
   tells Trun where it is, he turns out not to be so different from 
   Kardis. Trun and his men rule the cave with an iron fist, much to the 
   chagrin of Stryker (Who says to Trun, &quot;You have a mirror in your 
   mind. I think you should look in it!&quot;), who leaves in disgust. 
   When Kardis attacks the cave, he captures a departing Stryker and 
   puts the hurt on him really bad. The dwarves appear to rescue Stryker 
   and they all return to the cave for a final battle. When the battle 
   is over, God rewards the winners by making it rain for the first time 
   since the nuclear bombs fell. God is funny sometimes.&nbsp; This is 
   the first of Filipino director/producer Cirio H. Santiago's many 
   post-nuke films and it is probably his best. Other films in 
   Santiago's post-apocalyptic palette include <B><A HREF="#WheelsOfFire">WHEELS

   edges them out for one main reason: Unlike those other films,

   substitute water for oil), but Santiago tosses-in so many chases, 
   gunfights, martial arts fights and nudity, you can't help but be 
   entertained. Santiago also supplies more gore than usual, including 
   decapitations, dismemberments, slashings, bloody bullet squibs and 
   some splattery gunshots to the head. There is also a slight attempt 
   to give Stryker an emotional core. When Stryker watches the three 
   goons raping Delha, he flashes back to his wife's rape/decapitation 
   and he loses it, punching one of the rapists in the face until all 
   that's left is a bloody pulp. When Delha tries to kiss him later on 
   as he leaves the spring, all he can muster for her is a hug, his 
   wife's memory still burned in his brain. Hey, it's not much, but it's 
   more than you usually get in films of this type. Besides, watching a 
   tribe of dwarves (a Santiago trademark) running around with blowguns 
   and talking their own special brand of gibberish is what makes 
   Santiago's films so special. It's outlandish, but he somehow makes it 
   work. Also starring Joseph Zucchero, Julie Gray, John Harris III,

   gang invade the Sisters Of The Holy Spirit Hospital and School, where 
   they beat a nun to death and force a mute girl to commit suicide 
   rather than letting herself be gang-raped by these creeps (It is 
   implied early on that this gang may also be cannibals, as we watch 
   Bigman kill one of his own and the rest of the gang strip his body 
   and hover over it with knives in hand before the film cuts to the 
   next scene). We then watch Ben and his family at Eden Farms, where 
   Ben spends a good chunk of his time on a ham radio, looking for signs 
   of life on other parts of the planet. Ben and his family then drive 
   to the nearest deserted town to loot supplies and gas for the 
   generators back home (they also load-up boxes full of dresses, canned 
   goods and comic books). Seventeen year-old Rachel pines for a 
   boyfriend so she can show off the sexy dresses she has just stolen. 
   Meanwhile, handsome Adam Strong (Morgan Stevens), who has just buried 
   his mother, sets out alone in the Survival Zone looking for 
   adventure. After spending a night in a seemingly haunted town (he's 
   chased out of a motel room by flying furniture, mirrors that break by 
   themselves and a strange wind that appears out of nowhere), Adam 
   drives to the Sisters Of The Holy Spirit, only to find human bones by 
   a roasting pit and the decapitated head of the mute girl (We then 
   learn that every member of the motorcycle gang, except for Bigman, 
   drank contaminated water and it has turned them into flesh-hungry 
   mutants). When the gang finally reaches Eden Farm and nearly kill 
   Uncle Luke, Ben and his family batten down the hatches and prepare 
   for the worst, moving Lucy and the children to a cave when darkness 
   comes. When Uncle Luke is stabbed to death while tending to his 
   horses, Ben is joined by Adam, who proves invaluable in fighting-off 
   the gang (As expected, romantic sparks fly between Adam and Rachel). 
   Can this family-plus-one defeat the gang and live happily ever 
   after?&nbsp; Director/producer/co-screenwriter Percival Rubens (who

   trappings, but comes up snake eyes thanks to clumsily edited action 
   scenes, a biker gang that wouldn't scare a kindergarten tricycle club 
   and violence that is pulled-back rather than embraced. Whenever 
   something gory is about to happen, the camera either pulls away or 
   cuts to the next scene (except for a shovel decapitation in the 
   finale). Rubens and co-scripter Eric Brown crams the film with 
   &quot;Family is stronger if Daddy makes the decisions&quot; crap, 
   including Ben heading back to the farm by himself to take on the 
   biker gang (he even knocks-out Adam so he won't follow him), which 
   totally takes the audience out of the film, since Ben is a farmer, 
   not a fighter. The mixture of American (Lockwood), Swedish (Sparv) 
   and South African (Marki and nearly everyone else) accents also lends 
   an air of ridiculous unreality to the film since it is supposed to 
   take place somewhere in the American Southwest (I guess Ruben also

   films, such as this pulpy sci-fi flick directed by the late Freddie 
   Francis (<B><A HREF="craze_1973.htm">CRAZE</A></B> - 1973). When a 
   group of meteorites land in a perfect &quot;V&quot; formation in an

    to investigate. The meteors contain alien life forms and they take 
   over the bodies of the scientists in what starts a chain reaction. 
   The aliens begin taking over the bodies of local labor, construction 
   workers, other scientists and the military and use them as labor to 
   build a secret underground base located in a nearby lake. What the 
   base is to be used for will be slowly explained throughout the film. 
   The one person in the area that the aliens can't seem to control is 
   Dr. Curtis Temple (Robert Hutton - <B><A HREF="slime_people_1963.htm">THE

   [1963]), who has a silver plate in his head due to a recent serious 
   car accident. The silver plate seems to block the aliens' attempts to 
   control him. After the aliens have infected the area with a deadly 
   disease the press is calling &quot;The Crimson Plague&quot;, Dr. 
   Temple begins a one-man crusade to find out the truth. What he finds 
   is that the aliens are using the infected people as labor and they 
   are sending them to the Moon in a rocket they have built under the 
   lake. Once on the Moon, the humans are helping the aliens fix their 
   spacecraft, which accidentally crashed there years before. Dr. Temple 
   attempts to hitch a ride on the next rocket to the Moon to free the 
   enslaved humans and bring them back to Earth. He has many stumbling 
   blocks to tackle before he reaches his destination. Once he gets to 
   the Moon, he finds out that the aliens only want to get back to their 
   home planet so they can die. After talking to Dr. Temple, the head 
   alien simply says, &quot;We need only have asked?&quot;, before the 
   movie ends on an upbeat moment. It's not so upbeat for the people 
   that have died, though, which is something I'm sure the filmmakers 
   would like you to forget. This film used to play quite frequently in 
   trunicated form during the 70's and early 80's on TV's THE 4:30 MOVIE 
   (it's now in the public domain). The screenplay (by Amicus co-founder 
   Milton Subotsky) plays like a Republic Pictures serial of the 30's, 
   as every 10 or 15 minutes Dr. Temple would get into a new fix with 
   seemingly no way out. But he always escapes to the next leg of the 
   trip. Director Freddie Francis seems to be just a hired hand here, as 
   it contains none of his patented camera flourishes that he is so 
   well-known for. The special effects are very Dr. Who-ish (spartan 
   sets and model effects) and the jazzy score seems out of place. There 
   are some absurd scenes (melting down silver trophies to make silver 
   helmets to block the aliens' control) but not really much else to 
   recommend unless you don't mind mindless entertainment that's easily 
   forgotten shortly after you've watched it. Consider it Chinese food 
   for the eyes. Also starring Jennifer Jayne, Zia Mohyeddin, Bernard 
   Kay and Michael Gough as the &quot;Master Of The Moon&quot;.

   German sci-fi TV movie that was re-edited and dubbed for English 
   speaking territories. In the near future, after a devastating 
   worldwide nuclear holocaust, every living person is issued an 
   &quot;Energy Card&quot;, which determines how long you have left to 
   live. Energy Cards can be recharged depending on such factors as 
   procreation or being energy efficient, but once your card runs out of 
   energy, an elite force of law officers called &quot;Exit Men&quot; 
   are sent to extinguish your life by any means necessary (Shades of <B><A HREF="logans_run_1976c.htm">LOGAN'S

   understanding Len Barta (Albert Fortell) and the cruel and inhumane

   eliminating people who have no energy credits left on their cards.

    is playing fast and loose with people's lives, as his latest 
   termination assignment, an aging female breeder, still has credits 
   left on her Energy Card, yet he is ordered to kill her (She commits 
   suicide by jumping out of her highrise window after planting seeds of 
   doubt about Centron's motives in Len's mind). Jacob is envious of Len 
   because he is considered the number one Exit Man, so he watches Len's 
   every move very carefully, looking for any excuse to report him to 
   Centron. It doesn't help that Len's Centron-appointed girlfriend, 
   Sarah (Hannelore Elsner), is actually a member of an underground 
   rebel movement who was sent to assassinate Len, but instead of 
   killing him she begins to fall in love with him while trying to 
   change his views of love and death. It also doesn't help that Len has 
   just killed the last married couple left in the world; an elderly 
   Jewish couple that Len murders with a single sniper bullet that 
   passes through both their heads while they are having supper together 
   (A small boy praises Len for killing them both with a single shot, to 
   which Len responds, &quot;It's more energy efficient that way.&quot;).
    Len's next assignment is an old man who turns out to be Sarah's 
   grandfather, but when Len discovers Sarah's involvement, he covers it 
   up and lets the old man escape. This is exactly the opening Jacob 
   needs to bring down Len and become the number one Exit Man. After one 
   last execution that finally opens his eyes to the uselessness of 
   killing, Len joins forces with Sarah and they plan on escaping to the 
   &quot;Outside&quot; where Centron has no control. When Jacob kills 
   Sarah before they can make it there, Len uses all his Exit Men 
   knowledge to hunt down Jacob and kill him, but not before making 
   Jacob know exactly how it feels to be the person staring down the 
   barrel of a gun rather than the one pulling the trigger.&nbsp; This 
   is a slow-moving, yet effective sci-fi drama about how saving energy 
   of every kind, whether electrical, human or environmental, is more 
   important than human life. Director L.E. Neiman and screenwriters 
   James Wager, James Beckett and Byrd Ehlmann (the original edit of 
   this film credits Peter Samann as director and Hans Bachmann as 
   screenwriter, but the differences between the two edits are drastic) 
   display the not-too-distant future as a colorless, sterile 
   environment, where commercials play on TV extolling the use of 
   suicide pills over bullets for those whose Energy Card credits have 
   expired because it &quot;saves energy&quot;. Another telling scene 
   comes when Len kills the last married couple and, shortly thereafter, 
   all references to the word &quot;marriage&quot; are wiped from the 
   world's computer databanks because the practice of marriage is now 
   considered archaic and useless in this utopian society. The most 
   effective sequence comes when Len is sent to kill a middle-aged 
   novelist, only to discover that the novelist is hosting a huge last 
   Energy Card-depleting party with all his friends (He says to Len, 
   &quot;I could have saved a few credits and lasted a few months more, 
   but that kind of life is tedious!&quot;). He insists that Len kill 
   him in front of all his friends and Len complies, but instead of 
   bringing gasps and screams, all the novelist's friends applaud, which 
   visibly upsets Len and proves to be his turning point. This is a 
   society where even dancing is considered a waste of energy and could 
   eventually cost you your life (I bet Al Gore never thought of this in 
   his wildest dreams!). While there is very little actual action or 
   bloodshed on view, <B>TIME TROOPERS</B> is a thought-provoking 
   parable on how energy conservation can be taken to levels that most 
   would never think possible. It's not for everyone, but it is food for 
   thought. Also starring Wolfgang Gasser, Judith Estermann, Wolfgang 
   Muellner, Barbara Rudnik and Dietrich Siegl. Originally released on

   serious problems to deal with: First is that a trio of prisoners plan 
   to steal his ship to escape the penal colony. The rules are pretty 
   tough here. Make one mistake and you are killed by the guards. No 
   exceptions. Wolf's second problem is a little more urgent. Every time

   monster (hence the title). Each time he gets an erection it gets 
   worse and it begins to put a cramp on his relationship with the 
   nurse. To satisfy his animalistic urges he begins screwing the female 
   prisoners (killing one of them) which causes his disease to spread 
   among the population. The prison's priest (Patrick Macnee) has seen 
   this happen 26 years before on another planet. He believes the female 
   alien is a Succubus, sent by the Devil to spread his evil and destroy 
   mankind. With the help of Wolf he plans to stop the spread of the 
   plague. This also means they have to stop the trio of prisoners from 
   escaping so the plague doesn't infect another planet. Can they do it?

   favorite Italian post-apocalypse film of the 80's. It comes as no 
   surprise that both films were directed by Joe D'Amato (using the name

   Cliver). In a nuked-out Texas, Nisus (Cliver) and his band of Texas 
   Rangers save the life of Maida (Sabrina Siani; <B><A HREF="conquest_1983.htm">CONQUEST</A></B> 
   - 1983) from a bunch of rapist thugs who crucify a priest and rape 
   some nuns (one nun slits her own throat with a shard of glass, but it 
   doesn't stop one thug from screwing her corpse). Tired of all the 
   violence and bloodshed, Nisus quits the Rangers and joins Maida's 
   commune. A few years pass and Nisus is married to<A HREF="2020_texas_gladiators_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2020 texas gladiators vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="234" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Maida and they have a young daughter. The commune is thriving and 
   they have their own power plant, where they produce a new form of 
   energy which everyone wants. One day, the commune is invaded by a 
   motorcycle gang led by Catch Dog (Daniel Stephen; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#WarBus">WAR
    BUS</A></B> - 1985), a disgraced Ranger Nisus kicked off the force 
   years earlier. The gang is working in tandem with a jack-booted 
   military force called the New Order, whose boss is a chrome-domed 
   facist called the Black One (Donald O'Brien; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DoctorButcher1980">DOCTOR
    BUTCHER M.D.</A></B> - 1980). They take over the commune and put the 
   citizens under strict military rule. Nisus is tied up and forced to 
   watch as Maida is raped. Nisus eventually frees himself but is shot 
   repeatedly and killed. Maida is passed around from man to man until 
   she ends up at a bar, the property of someone who won her in a card 
   game. Also in the bar are two ex-Rangers and friends of Nisus: Jab 
   (Harrison Muller; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#She1983">SHE</A></B> - 
   1983) and Halakron (Peter Hooten; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#NightKiller1989">NIGHT
    KILLER</A></B> - 1989). They get into a bar fight and are arrested 
   and sent to work in the salt mines as punishment. Their friend 
   (another ex-Ranger), Red Wolfe (Al Yamanouchi; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#After Fall NY">AFTER
    THE FALL OF NEW YORK</A></B> - 1983), helps them escape the mines. 
   Their next stop: The commune, where they help Maida get some old 
   fashioned Texas payback and help her find her daughter. With the help 
   of some Native Americans, they prove that the Texas Rangers always 
   get their man.&nbsp; Though not as thought-provoking as <B><A HREF="endgame_1983b.htm">ENDGAME</A></B>,
    D'Amato supplies enough violence, gore and nudity for a dozen films. 
   Hardly a moment goes by where someone isn't shot in the head, 
   stabbed, run over, set on fire or raped (both men and women). Besides 
   the scene of a nun committing suicide, you'll see a game of Russian 
   roulette, numerous motorcycle stunts and crashes, a tribe of 
   futuristic Indians (best seen to be believed, they even bang on 
   tom-toms, ride horses and live in teepees!) and even some toothless 
   Mexicans. This twisted futuristic take on the American Western 
   contains all the old standbys: A one-on-one Cowboy vs. Indian knife 
   fight, the metaphorical circling of the wagons (the initial seige of 
   the commune), the charge of the cavalry (the fight to gain control of 
   the commune in the finale), an Indian raid on horseback (where spears 
   and arrows defeat the New Order's futuristic force field) and even a 
   final showdown at high noon. Granted, this is nonsense, but it is 
   enjoyable nonsense. It's bloody enough to keep gorehounds happy and 
   fast moving for those who crave action. As in <B>ENDGAME</B>, George 
   Eastman (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Anthropophagus1980">THE GRIM REAPER</A></B>

   thought I had seen every 80's Italian post-nuke film, this 
   craptacular flick crossed my path. To add insult to injury, this 
   ridiculously-dubbed effort was released on VHS as part of Cannon 
   Video's short-lived &quot;<B><A HREF="michael_dudikoff_presents_action_adventure_theater_vhs_series.htm">Michael

   where Dudikoff (who doesn't appear in the film proper) stiffly 
   introduces the feature, obviously reading off cue cards (follow his 
   bouncing pupils!) while sitting in a screening room. The storyline to <B><A HREF="urban_warriors_1987d.htm">URBAN
    WARRIORS</A></B> is generic post-apocalyptic stuff: Three 
   technicians, led by Brad (Karl Landgren), working in an underground 
   bunker, are seemingly the only people on Earth left alive when a 
   nuclear war breaks out (queue the stock footage, including a 
   head-scratching shot of a volcano erupting), leaving the surface of 
   the planet a burned-out shell. After digging their way to the 
   surface, the trio search for food (They find cans of chili and begin 
   to pig out. One guy says to Brad, &quot;Be careful or you<A HREF="urban_warriors_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/urban warriors vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>'ll
    get sick!&quot;, to which Brad replies, &quot;In my considered 
   opinion, who cares!&quot;) and soon find out that they are not alone. 
   The radiation on the surface has turned some of the survivors into 
   violent, bloodthirsty headhunters and after Brad finds one of his 
   comrade's decapitated head laying on a car hood, he and Marty (Bjorn 
   Hammer) make a hasty retreat in a car with the headhunters chasing 
   them with motorcycles and jeeps. Luckily, the headhunters pass out 
   when darkness approaches, allowing Brad and Marty to escape and find 
   a place that they will use as their new hideout. They stupidly come 
   up with a plan to split up and look for unaffected humans by day and 
   return to their hideout before night falls (Um, shouldn't they do the 
   exact opposite?). Realizing their mistake (Marty nearly gets captured 
   by three headhunters on motorcycles), Brad and Marty decide to stick 
   together and only look for human survivors after the sun sets but, 
   wouldn't you know it, the first night they go out their car breaks 
   down and, as the sun rises, Marty is shot in the back and killed by a 
   shotgun-toting headhunter. Brad is not alone for long, though, as he 
   runs into Julia (Rosenda Schaschmidt) and they quickly become lovers. 
   It turns out Julia is actually a headhunter sent to entrap Brad. The 
   headhunters capture Brad (and kill Julia when she tries to kill Brad 
   for his &quot;spinal marrow&quot;, which the headhunters need to stay 
   alive) and convict him of &quot;crimes against nature&quot; (What?). 
   Crap, do I need to go on? Okay, Brad meets an unaffected girl named 
   Angela (Malisa Longo, here billed as &quot;Malisa Lang&quot;), they 
   escape the headhunters and walk hand-in-hand into the sunset, their 
   future hopeful, but uncertain. I may just pass out from boredom.&nbsp;
    This is a dreadfully slow and uninvolving post-nuke thriller that 
   lacks the violence and gore usually found in these Italian <B><A HREF="road_warrior_1982.htm">ROAD
    WARRIOR</A></B> rip-offs (Rosenda Schaschmidt gives an extended 
   full-frontal nude scene for those who keep track of such things). The 
   plot is extremely convoluted and lacks logic of any kind (it is never 
   explained how the headhunters were able to organize themselves in 
   such a short period of time) and if nearly all of the action scenes 
   look familiar, it's because they are &quot;borrowed&quot; from the 
   earlier Italian post-nuke flick, <B><A HREF="#FinalExecutioner">THE

    After this long-winded introduction comes a film so devoid of 
   entertainment value that everyone should see it at least once, if for 
   no other reason than to see how to make a filmic version of Ambien 
   with a 20mg Valium chaser. The hero of our story (if you want to call 
   him that) is simply known as The Rider (Robert Ginty; <B><A HREF="exterminator_1980.htm">THE
    EXTERMINATOR</A></B> - 1980; <B><A HREF="cop_target_1990.htm">COP TARGET</A></B> 
   - 1990), a man who rides around on a motorcycle with a talking 
   computer named Einstein, that only seems to talk in slang, calling 
   Omega law enforcement &quot;very bad mothers&quot; and a Geek tribe 
   of Marginal teenagers &quot;dorks&quot;, &quot;dickheads&quot; and 
   &quot;veg-outs&quot;. Too bad Einstein doesn't protect Rider, because 
   in the first few minutes of the film he is shot in the shoulder, 
   takes a crossbow bolt in his leg, and is shot in the helmet, the 
   bullet grazing his skull and to make matters worse, Einstein steers 
   the cycle into the side of a mountain and it explodes! It turns out 
   the side of the mountain is actually the &quot;Secret Wall of 
   Illusion&quot;, put there by the Enlightened Elders, because 
   &quot;only the pure at heart can pass though it and live.&quot; We 
   then see the Enlightened Elders levitate in the air and instantly 
   heal Rider's wounds with a light that emits from their hands, while 
   The Henchman (Fred Williamson; <B><A HREF="take_a_hard_ride_1975.htm">TAKE
    A HARD RIDE</A></B> - 1975) tells the leader of the Elders (Vincio 
   Ricci) that it doesn't look like Rider is going to make it, the Elder 
   telling him, &quot;In our world, the spirit is stronger than the 
   flesh&quot; (In the only bit that made me laugh, Williamson puts his 
   arm on the levitating leader's shoulders to bring him back down to 
   earth). After healing him, the Elders ask Rider to help them defeat 
   The Omega, but he refuses, that is until Nastasia (Persis Khambatta; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#SheWolvesWasteland">SHE-WOLVES
    OF THE WASTELAND</A></B> - 1987) holds a laser pistol to his crotch, 
   telling him if he doesn't help free her father from Prossor and The 
   Omega, she will blow his balls off. He agrees and we then see him and 
   Nastasia walking in a cave full of spiders and snakes (There's a song 
   in there somewhere!), as wells as Mutants, but Rider pulls out a 
   disposable miniature flame-thrower and fries their ass (It seems 
   Nastasia isn't scared of spiders or snakes, but Mutants aren't what 
   it takes to love her!).The cave takes the pair to Club Utopia and 
   Nastasia tells him whatever he does, not to show any emotion, because 
   it is outlawed by Prossor. The club is a place where people go to get 
   their jollies by dancing sexually with each other, but can show no 
   pleasure outwardly, because it, too, is outlawed, explaining to Rider 
   that emotions are only for the elite in this society. We hear Prossor 
   (Donald Pleasence; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#VampireInVenice1988">VAMPIRE
    IN VENICE</A></B> - 1988) saying over-and over on a loudspeaker, 
   &quot;Work is everyone's freedom. Work must be neat and efficient. 
   Food and entertainment are provided. Silence is its own reward&quot;, 
   as Rider and Nastasia walk among the throngs of people, all of them 
   with the same blank expression on their faces (the look you'll have 
   watching this film).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Nastasia and Rider, who are dressed as workers, enter the main 
   computer bank room of the city, where Nastasia discovers where her 
   father, Professor McWayne (Harrison Muller Sr.), is being held, which 
   is guarded by The Omega, who dress and walk like Nazi Stormtroopers. 
   They then watch as some &quot;non-efficients&quot; are terminated by 
   a machine that electrocutes them and then The Omega guards burn their 
   bodies with flame-throwers, while the populace watches the action 
   stone-faced. They manage the free the Professor and a gunfight ensues 
   (the machineguns make laser noises!). Luckily (?), they find a 
   helicopter and make their escape, only Nastasia is hit and doesn't 
   make it to the copter, leaving Rider no choice but to take off 
   without her. The Professor begs Rider to go back and save his 
   daughter, but he tells the Professor that he was only hired to rescue 
   him and that's what he is going to do, nothing more. We then see 
   Prossor (who looks and dresses exactly like <A HREF="you_only_live_twice_1967_blofeld_photos.htm">Blofeld</A>,
    a character Pleasence played in <B><A HREF="you_only_live_twice_1967.htm">YOU
    ONLY LIVE TWICE</A></B> - 1967, complete with white pussycat in his 
   arms!) questioning and slapping Nastasia around and when he doesn't 
   get the answers he wants, he tells his men to take her to the 
   &quot;Assembly Line&quot;, where she will have her brain wiped clean 
   and be just like everyone else in this emotionless society.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Professor takes Rider to where four Marginal tribes (The 
   Amazons, The Geeks, The Martial Artists and The Mercenaries) are 
   fighting each other, telling Rider that he is going to need to get 
   their help if his plan to defeat Prossor and The Omega is going to 
   succeed. He tells Rider to get their attention, so after taking a few 
   kung fu kicks to his head, he starts kicking some ass until only he 
   and the leader of The Amazons tribe (Geretta Geretta; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Rats">RATS:
    NIGHT OF TERROR</A></B> - 1983) are left. Rider punches her in the 
   face, knocking her lights out and then gets everyone's attention. The 
   Professor then gives a rousing (?) speech, telling them that The New 
   Way needs them to defeat The Omega and when Rider raises his fist in 
   the air, everyone cheers and he becomes their new leader (jeez, that 
   was easy!). We then see Nastasia on the Assembly Line, as she is 
   about to have her mind wiped and become an emotionless zombie, but

    Einstein gives the best performance in this film, you know you are 
   watching a flick everyone is ashamed to appear in. Both Robert Ginty 
   and Donald Pleasence look bored beyond tears, turning in performances 
   as emotionless as the citizens of The Omega town. There is some good 
   action and things blow up rather well, but when it is mixed among 
   some of the worst stunts imaginable, it negates all the good. When 
   Einstein dies (His final readout is &quot;Got Me!&quot;), it's the 
   most emotional performance in the film, which should tell you how 
   awful this movie really is. I could tell you everything that is wrong 
   with this film, but I haven't got the time or the available website 
   space, so you should check it out for yourself if you are a masochist 
   or just take my word for it. This film just rambles on endlessly 
   (like this review), none of the scenes connected to each other for 
   what seems like an eternity. Even Fred Williamson (no stranger to the 
   post-apocalypse genre, appearing in <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Nine90BronxWar1982">1990:

   he appears in the opening minutes and then disappears until the 
   conclusion, his role nothing but an extended cameo. If the future of

   Filipino post-nuke flick from director Bobby A. Suarez, so you know 
   you're in for some fun. Set&nbsp; 120 years in the future, the film 
   opens with Trapper (Michael James) and his band of nomads/warriors 
   walking the nuked-out countryside looking for drinkable water and 
   food. They happen upon a rival gang of nomads, led by Giant Bill 
   (Pete Cooper), and a battle breaks out. Out of the shadows comes Anuk 
   (Franco Guerrero) and he saves Trapper's life. After the battle is 
   over, Trapper discovers that Anuk is well-supplied with food and 
   water. Anuk tells Trapper that he comes from the &quot;Mountain of 
   Life&quot;, a mystical place where it is said the survivors of the 
   last war moved and started a new, prosperous civilization (and Anuk 
   is over 150 years old!). Anuk agrees to take them there and the rest 
   of the film is their adventures as they travel to &quot;Voodoo 
   Mountain&quot; (A nickname Trapper gives their destination). They are 
   first captured by a tribe of cannibals, but the two black slaves they 
   rescued from Wild Bill's gang saves them (and they are still <A HREF="warriors_of_the_apocalypse_1985b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/warriors of the apocalypse vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>loyal
    to Wild Bill, who is now very sick). Trapper and his men then run 
   into a tribe of bloodthirsty dwarves who refuse to die (they're 
   immortal like Anuk).&nbsp; They take the gang prisoner and lead them 
   to their village (it's also Anuk's village, as he turns out to be a 
   traitor), where there seems to be an overabundance of scantily clad 
   white women and the Queen who rules there (Deborah Moore) has 
   telekinetic powers. The high priest (scripter Ken Metcalfe), who also 
   has telekinetic powers, helps Trapper and his men escape, but they 
   are being tracked by the dwarves and some female warriors and are 
   soon recaptured. Surprisingly, the men are treated well by the women, 
   but this village holds a dark and nasty secret. Trapper and his male 
   buddies are to be sacrificed in some weird fertility ritual, where 
   they drink freshly-slaughtered chicken's blood and have sex with the 
   women before they are about to be killed. When the Queen's horribly 
   radiation-scarred slaves revolt and attack her, it throws a monkey 
   wrench into her plans. Trapper and his gang escape and Trapper 
   decides to help rebuild the village after the Queen dies and he kills 
   Anuk (who is no longer immortal now that the Queen is dead).&nbsp; 
   Since this is a Bobby A. Suarez film, you know what to expect: Lots 
   of violence, lots of fighting and humor from situations where you 
   don't expect humor to be present. The immortal dwarves are a hoot 
   (What is it with the Philippines and midgets? Is there something in 
   the water?) as is the cave near the village where the Queen renews 
   her powers by getting zapped by a huge metal rod. The comedy relief 
   comes from an extremely fat woman (the only fat one, actually) in the 
   Queen's village.&nbsp; She hits on all of Trapper's men and is the 
   only woman during the fertility ritual to go without a man. The 
   reveal of what's actually in the cave (it's an old nuclear power 
   plant that's been converted somehow to be a magical device that gives 
   the villagers immortality, but kills the slaves working there with 
   radiation poisoning) comes totally out of left field and is never 
   properly explained, which just adds to the film's goofy charms. 
   There's also the battle where Ken Metcalfe (frequent Suarez scripter 
   and co-star) and Deborah Moore fight each other by shooting laser 
   beams out of their eyes!&nbsp; While the film makes little sense, 
   there's enough offbeat charms here for a dozen films, including 
   topless women, mutants with bad skin, a black slave with the tightest 
   afro in post-apocalyptic history, explosions, gun battles, midget 
   kung-fu and two of Trapper's men stop dead in their tracks while 
   being pursued to smoke a joint! Of course they get caught, but they 
   are laughing when they do. <B><A HREF="warriors_of_the_apocalypse_1985e.htm">WARRIORS

    TO BLOOD CITY</A><A NAME="WelcomeBloodCity"></A> (1977) -</B> In 
   this futuristic thriller, a group of diverse people wake up in a 
   desert, with no memory of who they are or how they got there. They 
   are all dressed in prison gray uniforms and each of them has a card 
   in their shirt pocket telling them the number (or &quot;score&quot;) 
   of how many people they supposedly have killed. Lewis (Keir Dullea) 
   tears up his card (&quot;You shouldn't have done that!&quot;) and 
   leads the group on the long trek through the desert. They are 
   attacked by two fat hillbillies with shotguns, who steal all their 
   boots and one of them rapes Martine (Hollis McLaren). They are then 
   met by Frendlander (Jack Palance), a cowboy lawman on horseback, who 
   leads them to Blood City, a seemingly Wild West town full of people 
   just like Lewis' group. Frendlander informs them that they will be 
   treated like slaves. The town is policed by a bunch of black-dressed 
   cowboys (with big red cross patches on their chests) and all the 
   &quot;slaves&quot; are assigned numbers (Lewis becomes number 9). We 
   then realize that this is all some weird secret experiment being 
   performed by the government, as scientist Katherine (Samantha Eggar) 
   and &quot;The Supervisor&quot; (Barry Morse) closely monitor the 
   action on close-circuit TV screens in a control center. This seems to 
   be some giant virtual reality game where the scientists are looking f<A HREF="welcome_to_blood_city_1977.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/welcome to blood city vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="134" HEIGHT="246" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>or
    &quot;survivors&quot; (of what is not explained) and Lewis seems to 
   fit the bill. He's a loose cannon and kills a man in town who wants 
   to buy him as a slave. He's made a &quot;citizen&quot; for killing 
   the man and Katherine enters the game under various guises to tempt 
   and control Lewis, but when Lewis and some of the other people in <B><A HREF="welcome_to_blood_city_1977b.htm">WELCOME
    TO BLOOD CITY</A></B> begin having flashbacks of their former lives, 
   the experiment begins to unravel. When Lewis begins to question his 
   existence in this world, the scientists keep changing the scenario to 
   throw him off. When Sheriff Frendlander also begins to have his 
   doubts (he may have been a former lover of Katherine), The Supervisor 
   changes the rules of the game, which doesn't sit too well with 
   Katherine. When Katherine realized that she can no longer control 
   Lewis, she programs Frendlander to become his enemy, but Frendlander 
   wants nothing to do with it and takes his own life.&nbsp; The finale 
   finds The Supervisor deciding that Lewis has the right stuff and 
   pulls him out of the game. When Lewis sees the type of life he has to 
   look forward to, he booby traps and cripples the game so that he will 
   now be the permanent new sheriff of Blood City.&nbsp;&nbsp; Think of 
   this as a more cerebral (and surreal) version of <B><A HREF="westworld_1973.htm">WESTWORLD</A></B> 
   (1973) and you'd be partly right, but this film's aspirations reach 
   higher than that. Long before &quot;virtual reality&quot; became a 
   recognizable phrase in the English vocabulary, this film was 
   exploring how such technology could be used to control and change 
   people but, in the long run, it's the human spirit (and maybe the 
   soul) that's stronger than anything science can throw in our 
   direction.&nbsp; Using a Wild West town as the virtual world is a 
   natural choice because everyone can picture a Wild West town in our 
   minds, thanks to the plentiful Western films and TV shows we've 
   watched during our lifetime. It's the most recognizable time period 
   in human history. This existential thriller contains plenty of action 
   (mainly gunfights), but seems to be mainly concerned with clever 
   wordplay (people in the game that have memories of their former lives 
   are said to be in &quot;consciousness crisis&quot;) and the strength 
   of the human will. The late Jack Palance (<B><A HREF="alone_in_the_dark_1982.htm">ALONE
    IN THE DARK</A></B> - 1982) is excellent as the town sheriff who 
   thinks he's immortal (thanks to Katherine's programming), but past 
   memories tell him otherwise and he acts on it accordingly, in a 
   moment of self-sacrifice. Keir Dullea (<B><A HREF="2001_a_space_odyssey_1968.htm">2001:
    A SPACE ODYSSEY</A></B> - 1968) and Samantha Eggar (<B><A HREF="brood_1979.htm">THE
    BROOD</A></B> - 1979) don't have much to do here, even if they have 
   the biggest roles. This film's not about acting anyway, it's about 
   ideas and this film poses a lot of thought-provoking questions. It 
   may not be everyone's cup of tea, but this little-seen Canada/United 
   Kingdom co-production is an early precursor to such films as <B><A HREF="ghost_in_the_machine_1995.htm">GHOST

   hood ornament!) and bring her back to <A HREF="wheels_of_fire_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wheels of fire dutch vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>base
    camp, where she is raped by Scourge and then given to his men to be 
   gang-raped (Bo is also raped by Scourge's men and then dragged behind 
   a car, forcing Trace to shoot Bo rather than leaving him in 
   excruciating misery). Trace gets some help in his quest to save his 
   sister from black leather-clad female warrior Stinger (Laura Banks; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DemonOfParadise">DEMON
    OF PARADISE</A></B> - 1987) and her pet falcon. Stinger is also 
   after Scourge for reasons of her own, but both she and Trace get 
   sidetracked when Stinger is captured by a tribe of cannibalistic 
   white-haired dwarves called the Sandmen (Hey, no Santiago film is 
   complete without dwarves!), who live (where else?) under the sand. 
   Trace saves Stinger and a telepathic girl named Spike (Linda 
   Grovenor) from being the Sandmen's next Happy Meals and they continue 
   on their journey. They pick up another member when they save a mute 
   midget named Mud from some mutants and then drive to a village 
   occupied by crackpot Whiz (Joseph Zucchero) and his followers (Whiz 
   is building a &quot;rocket&quot;, which he plans on flying his 
   followers to a better planet, although it's obvious to any sane 
   person that this rocket will never achieve lift-off, especially since 
   parts of it are made out of wood!). Trace leaves everyone behind in 
   the village and sets out to rescue his sister on his own, but he is 
   captured by Scourge and tortured. Stinger, Spike and Mud lead a 
   friendly squad of fighters (who belong to a government group known as 
   &quot;The Ownership&quot;) to save the day, leaving a freed Trace to 
   face-off with Scourge. Not everyone, both good and bad, will make it 
   out alive.&nbsp; This is totally entertaining junk from start to 
   finish. Not only does Santiago offer us non-stop action, gun battles, 
   explosions, car crashes and weird characters, he also has co-star 
   Lynda Wiesmeier go topless for 90% of her screen time. That alone is 
   worth the price of admission. Santiago, whose other 80's post-nuke 
   actioners include <B><A HREF="#Stryker1983">STRYKER</A></B> (1983), <B><A HREF="#Equalizer2000">EQUALIZER
    2000</A></B> (1986) and <B><A HREF="#Sisterhood1987">THE SISTERHOOD</A></B> 
   (1987), never takes frequent collaborator Frederick Bailey's 
   clich&eacute;-ridden script too seriously, although there is a scene 
   later in the film where Trace has to watch sister Arlie, who has been 
   raped by nearly all of Scourge's men during her captivity, beg for 
   something to eat from her captors, offering her body for a morsel of 
   food. This is as close to pathos as this film gets, because the 
   remainder of the flick is a series of action set-pieces, where Trace 
   and his new partners get in and out of trouble. Trace likes to burn 
   his victims to a crisp with his portable flame-thrower, giving 
   Santiago ample opportunities to showcase stuntmen running or doing 
   high falls while on fire, one of Santiago's signature trademark moves 
   in nearly every action film he made during the 70's, 80's &amp; 90's. 
   As a matter of fact, <B><A HREF="wheels_of_fire_1985.htm">WHEELS OF FIRE</A></B>

   Numerals, learn them! Yes, I am talking to you, Scream Factory!) a 
   lot of people have been making unfair comparisons between this film 
   and <B><A HREF="predator_1987.htm">PREDATOR</A></B> (1987), thanks to 
   a ten second throw-away piece of dialogue spoken by Jack Palance at 
   the end of the film. The only real connections these two films have 
   in common is that there's a tall alien on Earth (the locations 
   between both films couldn't be more different) and both aliens were 
   played by the late Kevin Peter Hall (who is credited as &quot;Kevin 
   Hall&quot; in this film), who doesn't make an appearance in this film 
   until the closing minutes (not to mention that the aliens couldn't be 
   more different in the looks department). Actually, if you want to 
   make comparisons, this film bears more of a resemblance to <B><A HREF="it_conquered_the_world_1956.htm">IT
    CONQUERED THE WORLD</A></B> (1956; You can thank Susan Hart, the 
   widow of A.I.P. co-founder James H. Nicholson, for holding this film 
   hostage for a disc release. The IMDb says she has direct ownership of 
   10 A.I.P films, including <B><A HREF="i_was_a_teenage_werewolf_1957.htm">I
    WAS A TEENAGE WEREWOLF</A></B> [1957], but there are those, myself 
   included, who think she directly owns many more of A.I.P.'s films, 
   which is why they are not on DVD or Blu-Ray.) thanks to the flying 
   little creatures the aliens throws at the humans like Frisbees (but 
   for different purposes) and attach themselves to the skin. 
   Thankfully, there's no &quot;Carrot Monster&quot; in this film. And 
   since it comes from director/producer Greydon Clark (who made the 
   underrated <B><A HREF="#Return 1980">THE RETURN</A></B> [1980] after 
   making this film), you know you are in for some good, gory fun. The 
   film opens up with a five minute cameo by Cameron<A HREF="without_warning_1979_blu-ray.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/without warning dvd6 front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="282" HEIGHT="325" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Mitchell (<B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#Raw Force">RAW FORCE</A></B> - 
   1981; probably for some booze money), who is out hunting by a lake 
   with his pascifist son Randy (Clark regular Darby Hinton; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Hi-Riders">HI-RIDERS</A></B> 
   - 1978), who is more interested in reading a book than firing a 
   shotgun (he dumps the two shotgun shells from his double-barrel 
   shotgun to the ground, something he will quickly regret doing). All 
   of a sudden, some small circular creatures come flying through the 
   air and attach themselves to Mitchell's face and back, their 
   tentacles burrowing underneath his skin (good effects by Greg Cannom 
   and his crew) and their toothy middle section chewing on his flesh 
   (they are quite the sight). When Randy sees what is happening he goes 
   to fire his shotgun at the creatures in the air coming for him but, 
   oops, he already discarded those shells on the ground. We are then 
   introduced to Sandy (Tarah Nutter; whose entire acting career 
   encompassed four years) and Beth (Lynn Theel; <A HREF="humanoids_from_the_deep_1980.htm"><B>HUMANOIDS
    FROM THE DEEP</B></A> - 1980) as they are about to go out on a date 
   to the lake with Beth's boyfriend Tom (the first film appearance by 
   David Caruso [<B><A HREF="csi_miami_tv.htm">CSI: MIAMI</A></B> - 
   2002-2012], who wears blue short shorts in all his scenes!) and set 
   up Sandy on a blind date with Greg (Christopher S. Nelson; <B><A HREF="tag_the_assassination_game_1982.htm">T.A.G.:
    THE ASSASSINATION GAME</A></B> - 1982). Before they get to the lake, 
   they stop at the local gas station and when they find the girl's 
   bathroom locked, Sandy decides to use the Mens Room, but sees the 
   words &quot;No Chance. No Escape. No Help.&quot; written on one of 
   the stalls and becomes creeped out, even moreso when the obviously 
   crazy Fred 'Sarge&quot; Dobby (Martin Landau; <B><A HREF="action.htm#BlackGunn">BLACK
    GUNN</A></B> - 1972) starts babbling something about aliens 
   infecting the city when he walks out of one of the stalls, but gas 
   station owner Joe Taylor (Jack Palance; <B><A HREF="alone_in_the_dark_1982.htm">ALONE
    IN THE DARK</A></B> - 1982; also with Landau) tells her to pay him 
   no mind (but Joe knows something he is not sharing with anyone else). 
   While this is going on, we see a Scoutmaster (Larry Storch; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Sweet Sixteen 1982">SWEET
    SIXTEEN</A></B> - 1982) and his group of young Scouts at the same 
   location on a nature hike. The flying creatures attach themselves to 
   the Scoutmaster and something large scares all the kids away. After 
   our two couples go to the lake, Tom and Beth head out to take a swim. 
   When they don't come back at nighttime, Greg and Sandy (who are 
   beginning to hit it off) go looking for them. They come upon a shack 
   in the middle of a field and when they look inside, the discover the 
   bosies of Tom, Beth, the Hunter and his son and the Scoutmaster, all 
   in various degrees of mutilation, with mustard-colored goo coming out 
   of all their wounds (some of the makeup effects are very good). It is 
   apparent that something is eating them and this shack is being used 
   as a food lacker, but the damn flying creatures chase Sandy and Greg 
   back to their van and attach themselves to the windshield. After 
   fumbling around looking for the keys and then having trouble starting 
   the van, our couple finally makes their getaway, but they decided to 
   stop at a bar (a bar???), leaving Sandy in the van (leaving her in 
   the van???) to get some help. He tells his story to the bar patrons, 
   which includes Leo (Neville Brand; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Mad Bomber">THE
    MAD BOMBER</A></B> - 1972); Dave (Ralph Meeker; <B><A HREF="#FoodOfTheGods1976">THE
    FOOD OF THE GODS</A></B> - 1976) and barmaid Aggie (Sue Ane Langdon; <B><A HREF="zapped_1982.htm">ZAPPED!</A></B> 
   - 1982), all in glorified cameos, but the only one to believe him is 
   Sarge, who says he has seen flying saucers in the area for years. The 
   rest think Sarge is a drunk ex-soldier who is suffering some form of 
   P.T.S.D. (they don't say &quot;P.T.S.D.&quot;, because it wasn't a 
   term used back then, but they imply it.). Just because he is drunk 
   and crazy, doesn't mean he is wrong. Joe than comes into the bar 
   carrying the body of Sandy. Seems she has seen the head alien and has 
   passed out. Suddenly, the electricity goes out and when the door of 
   the bar opens, Sarge uses his gun and shoots, thinking it is the 
   alien, but he shoots the Sheriff (But he did not shoot the deputy. 
   Old joke). Jim knows all about the aliens (he keeps a live flying one 
   in a jar back at his gas station to study it) and knows how to remove 
   tham from a body without killing the person (it's quite gross). Greg 
   and Sandy take Jim to the shack in the woods (where Jim makes a ten 
   second remark that the aliens may be hunting us for sport, but the 
   bodies are probably being used to feed the alien), where Jim sees all 
   the dead bodies, which are in worse condition when Greg and Sandy 
   originally saw them (Mitchell, Hinton and Storch'e bodies are 
   particularly in bad condition, especially Hinton's missing eye). Jim 
   is smiling and tells the couple that the alien will have to return 
   shortly to feed, but a flying creature attaches itself to Jim's leg 
   as he tells Greg and Sandy to leave because he has dangerous work to 
   do. While Greg and Sandy are dodging flying creatures left and right 
   as they are running through the woods, Jim cut's off the creature on 
   his leg. It seems like the main alien sends these little creatures to 
   incapacitate the humans until the alien can retrieve their bodies, 
   injecting them with some paralyzing venom and having a tiny meal with 
   their sharp teeth while they do so. Greg and Sandy flag down a police 
   car, only to find out too late after they jump into the caged, locked 
   back seat that Sarge is driving. He accuses them both of being aliens 
   in human bodies and has totally lost his mind, but they somehow 
   escape the police car and jump off a bridge into the water below. 
   Meanwhile, Jim is digging holes around the shed and filling them up 
   with explosives while Greg and Sandy find an empty house to get 
   clothes to replace their wet ones (for some reason, Sandy goes into a 
   crying jag over a broken music box that reminded her of her past). 
   It's also obvious that this house isn't occupied by just Greg and 
   Sandy. When Sandy wakes up from a short nap, she goes into the other 
   room to wake up Greg, who is sitting with his back to her on a big 
   comfy desk chair. When Sandy turns the chair around after Greg 
   doesn't answer her, she discovers one of the flying creatures&nbsp; 
   is attached to Greg's face (one of the biggest surprises of the film) 
   and the rather tall alien is seen for the first time (a first-rate 
   makeup job by Cannom). Rather than running for her life, Sandy 
   decides to hide in a shed under the porch of the house, but the alien 
   is too smart to fall for an old trick like that. Before the alien can 
   grab her, she is saved by Jim, who brings her back to the shack. 
   Sarge nearly ruins everything, but the alien kills him. Jim's body is 
   then covered with a whole bunch of the little flying suckers, so he 
   decides to give up his life by luring the alien to the shed while 
   Sandy uses the plunger to destroy everything. After the prerequisite 
   wiring problems (one of the wires has slipped off the connector), 
   Sandy manages to reconnect it and destroy the alien, Jim and the 
   shack in a huge explosion, putting an end to the alien menace. But 
   then we hear Sarge's crazy voice just before the end credits saying, 
   &quot;We ain't! We ain't alone!&quot; Full of gooey, juicy pieces of 
   gore and other messiness, this is one of Greydon Ckark's most 
   accomplished films (although, like I said before, I like <B><A HREF="return_1980_dvd2.htm">THE
    RETURN</A></B> better). Clark made a substantial amount of films of 
   all genres (he's still alive today, but hasn't directed a film since 
   1998. Some of his films include (beside the ones previously 
   mentioned): <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Bad Bunch">THE BAD BUNCH</A></B>

   am sure even Clark didn't expect: That two of the stars in this film 
   would have career resurgences in the 90's and both win Academy 
   Awards&reg;: Jack Palance as Best Actor in a Supporting Role, for his

   his portrayal as Bela Lugosi in Tim Burton's <B><A HREF="ed_wood_1994.htm">ED
    WOOD</A></B> (1994). It took four screenwriters, Lyn Freeman, Daniel 
   Grodnik, Ben Nett and Steve Mathis, to come up with the rather unique 
   story, but most of the characters are woefully underwritten, even the 
   two young leads. Only Martin Landau and Jack Palance get time to 
   shine, but we don't really watch these film for character 
   development, do we? <A HREF="http://www.screamfactorydvd.com">Scream Factory</A>,

   trailer. This is a great little time-waster that gives fans of these

   group of military misfits are sent to an uncharted island under the 
   pretense of cleaning up unexploded bombs left over from World War II. 
   What they find is something totally different. The island was 
   actually used by the government as a secret base for experiments on 
   the occupants of a crashed UFO. The soldiers find a roll of film that 
   shows scientists performing an autopsy on a live alien, while 
   it&#146;s mate watches horrified in a steel cage. The mate escapes 
   and kills all the scientists except one, who is now living on the 
   island as a hermit. The soldiers accidently release the alien again 
   and they are hunted down not only by the alien, but also by the 
   government who would like to cover-up the mess. This is the first 
   film to cash in on the supposedly &#147;true&#148; alien autopsy that 
   has received much publicity in the mid 90's. This is not a very good 
   film except for a few good gore scenes. The acting, screenplay and
