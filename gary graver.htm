   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">When
    low-budget filmmakers need a director of photography, Gary 
   Graver&#146;s name is usually on the top of their lists. A filmmaker 
   since the early 60&#146;s, Graver understands the business, thanks to 
   his varied and unusual background in the business. Gary Graver 
   graduated from Los Angeles City College in the early 60&#146;s. He 
   studied acting with Bruce Dern, Jeff Corey and Lee J. Cobb, where he 
   learned what w<!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/wild free &amp; hungry.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="106" HEIGHT="202" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0">ent
    on behind the cameras as well. The non-acting aspect of filmmaking 
   intrigued him and he decided to pursue a career in directing and 
   cinematography, occasionally acting to pick up some loose change. 
   What better way to hone his craft than in the field of exploitation 
   and sexploitation? Graver&#146;s first film as director of 
   photography was on </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="girls from thunder strip.htm">THE

   and became very much in demand. In the late 60&#146;s and early 
   70&#146;s he worked for the late Al Adamson (acting in and

   (both 1970). During the early 70&#146;s, Graver caught the eye of 
   none other than Orson Welles, who used Graver as director of 
   photography on most of his later film and TV projects, many of them 
   unfinished due to Welles&#146; huge ego (and even larger girth). What 
   does survive can be found in the Welles-directed documentary </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="f for fake.htm">F

   (1990). If you think Graver&#146;s output is staggering, consider 
   this: All the while he was working on A and B type films, he also had 
   a successful career as a director of hardcore adult films, directing 
   scores of pornographic titles using the pseudonym &quot;Robert 
   McCallum&quot;. Graver started making porno flicks to finance his 
   legitimate films, since they could be made on the cheap <A HREF="trick_or_treats_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/trick or treats.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="101" HEIGHT="195" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>in

   many more followed, right up to this day. Graver had a knack for 
   making porno films and many of his earlier stroke flicks have won 
   many Adult Film Awards, the porno equivalent of the Oscars. Films 
   such as<B> <A HREF="garage girls.htm">GARAGE GIRLS</A></B> (1977)</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"> <A HREF="800 fantasy lane.htm">800

   (1982) are considered adult film masterpieces and have been lauded 
   with awards, giving Graver more recognition than he will ever get in 
   the mainstream filmmaking community. But he had to hide his true 
   identity from the mainstream so he would not be blacklisted from 
   participating in making &quot;normal&quot; films. Ironic, isn&#146;t 
   it? His early porno films are extremely well made. They have good 
   stories (remember when they had stories?), nice photography (usually 
   done by Graver himself) and are shot on film. His later hardcore 
   efforts, with titles such as </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="east la law.htm">EAST

   (1992) are generally run-of-the-mill, shot-on-video porno pablum. But 
   hey, it&#146;s a living! You&#146;ll have a hard time finding a 
   personality that is more hard-working or has a more varied career. 
   Staying in a business that is as fickle as it is and to keep on 
   working in it for more than thirty years is a testament to Gary 
   Graver&#146;s talent and ambition. He has worked with some of the 
   best and some of the worst and even though most&nbsp; of the people 
   he worked with are either dead or no longer in the business, he is 
   still around and still going strong. Who else can say that they 
   worked with both Orson Welles and John Holmes? Although Gary Graver 
   may get a paragraph here and there in publications, he has never 
   gotten the recognition he rightly deserves. This article is my 
   tribute to him as a real artist. UPDATE: It is my sad duty to report 
   that Gary Graver died of cancer on November 17, 2006. The world has 
   lost a very talented cinematographer. R.I.P. Mr. Graver.</FONT></FONT></P>

   telephones her lover (Alexander Chapuies) to come on over after her 
   husband (Alain Mayniel) leaves on an overnight business trip. When 
   hubby comes home early and finds them taking a shower together, he 
   hits the lover repeatedly with a seashell ashtray. Thinking him to be 
   dead, the husband turns his attention to his wife. Trying to stick 
   her hand down the garbage disposal, the husband is stabbed and killed 
   by his wife. She hides his body in a closet. While trying to think 
   what to do next, a pair of burglars (including a woman with the

   wife with heroin and proceed to sexually assault her. Enter her 
   bloody, but still alive, lover who shoots the male burglar and chases 
   the topless female down the street until she is struck and killed by 
   a car. The wife and lover load her dead husband into her car and 
   drive away. A cop chases their speeding car and during the pursuit 
   they lose control of the car and perish down the side of a mountain. 
   The end. What?! Although there is plenty of nudity (Darc looks great 
   in the raw), this is still an unwatchable film. It is filled with 
   post-synch dubbing which frequently doesn't match the actors' lips 
   (especially during the lovemaking scenes) and is also chock full of 
   headache-inducing zoom shots that Jess Franco would love.

   her face. Several years pass and Joan has remarried to a guy named 
   Richard (David Carradine) and they are about to go to a Halloween 
   party. Yes, it's Halloween Night and Joan has hired aspiring actress 
   Linda (Jackelyn Giroux; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#WalkingTheEdge">WALKING
    THE EDGE</A></B> - 1983) to baby-sit her precocious son Christopher 
   (Chris Graver), who likes to play annoying practical jokes using the 
   many magic props in his collection. While Linda is handing out candy 
   to the kids, Christopher makes her life miserable using his magic 
   tricks and collection of rubber masks. Wouldn't you know it, Malcolm 
   escapes from the insane asylum and vows revenge on Joan. He plans on 
   returning to the only place he knows: The house where Linda is 
   babysitting Christopher. Linda grows weary of Christopher's pranks 
   and recites to him the cautionary tale of &quot;The Boy Who Cried 
   Wolf&quot;, but Christopher doesn't seem to comprehend the moral of 
   the story as he continues making her night with him a living hell, 
   including faking his own death by making it look liked he drowned in 
   the pool (When Linda revives him with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, 
   Christopher says to her, &quot;Thanks for the kiss, baby!&quot;). 
   Christopher will soon regret his actions. When Linda begins receiving 
   threatening phone calls from Malcolm (who mistakenly believes she is 
   Joan), she believes she is being pranked by Christopher and ignores 
   them. Christopher tries to tell her that he is not responsible, but 
   he has been such an insufferable prick all night, she doesn't believe 
   him. Malcolm, who is dressed like a nurse (complete with wig and red 
   lipstick), begins his journey to the house, running into winos, 
   drunks and street people who act crazier than him. He forces a wino 
   (a cameo appearance by Paul Bartel) to strip, steals his clothes and 
   then heads for the house, where he kills one of Linda's friends and 
   then terrorizes Linda and Christopher (who may or may not be 
   Malcolm's son). Christopher kills Malcolm with his homemade 
   guillotine and he swears to Linda that he is finished playing 
   practical jokes. The final shot shows that Christopher may, indeed, 
   be Malcolm's blood relation, as he seems to have graduated from 
   practical jokes to murder. This is a cheap-as-dirt horror flick (the 
   Insane Asylum set is nothing but a bunch of tables and beds on a 
   black backdrop) that actually got a theatrical release. It also tries 
   way too hard to be funny and lacks any blood or gore. It<A HREF="trick_or_treats_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/trick or treats ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="172" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>

   - 1990) made this film to showcase the talents of his son Chris, 
   who's such an annoying little twerp here, I wanted to reach through 
   the screen and throttle him myself. If that was what Mr. Graver was 
   going for here, he succeeded in spades, but I seriously doubt that 
   was the effect he was aiming for. Mr. Graver was an expert 
   cinematographer (he also photographed this film), but he's a very 
   lousy storyteller. This film just plods along at an all-too-leisurely 
   pace, as Christopher endlessly pranks Linda, who is way too patient 
   with this kid (I would have tied the little fucker to his bed and 
   called in an Exorcist!). The fact that hardly anyone dies (and when 
   they do, it's in complete darkness, another fault with this film), 
   coupled with absolutely no nudity, also makes this film a must-miss. 
   The only enjoyment here comes when film editor Andrea (Jillian 
   Kesner, who was also Graver's real-life wife. She appeared in a few 
   films, such as <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EvilTown">EVIL TOWN</A></B>

   clip of a lousy horror movie she is working on and proclaims that it 
   is the film editor who is the real magician of horror filmmaking, 
   because they can polish crap until it looks like gold. She talks 
   about how editors put segues into films to pad out the running time 
   and, damn, if that isn't what Graver does with this scene (Graver was 
   also this film's editor). It's the film's only inspired moment. It's 
   also apparent that Graver called in a lot of favors from his actor 
   friends. How else can you explain the presence of Snodgress, 
   Carradine, Bartel and even Steve Railsback (who plays Linda's 
   boyfriend in a couple of scenes) in an impoverished production such 
   as this? None of them have more than a couple of minutes of screen 
   time and it's clear that Graver used them because their names on the 
   marquees would draw more people into theater seats. The rest of <B><A HREF="trick_or_treats_1982.htm">TRICK
    OR TREATS</A></B> is a tired &quot;babysitter in peril&quot; flick 
   you've seen a thousand times before and done much better than this. 
   Orson Welles, who was a good friend of Graver's, is credited as the 
   consultant of the magic tricks used in this film. Also starring J.L. 
   Clark, Catherine E. Coulson and John Blyth Barrymore as a mad doctor 
   in a film-within-the-film. Released on VHS by <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Vestron Video">Vestron
