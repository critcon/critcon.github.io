     thoughts on the 2016 - 2017 TV Season.</B> All times are Eastern 
    Standard Time (EST): Since most of the new genre shows of the 
    beginning of the season are based on movies or previous popular TV 
    series, let's get started. First up: FOX's <B><A HREF="lethal_weapon_tv_series_2016.htm">LETHAL
     WEAPON</A></B> (Wednesdays 8:00pm) is almost an exact replica of all 
    four <B><A HREF="lethal_weapon_films_1987-1998.htm">LETHAL WEAPON movies</A></B>,
     with just a few small changes. Clayne Crawford (<B><A HREF="donner_party_2009.htm">THE
     DONNER PARTY</A></B> - 2009) portrays Martin Riggs, who in the 
    beginning of the first episode, is chasing a truck full of bad guys 
    through the Texas <A HREF="lethal_weapon_tv_series_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/lethal weapon 2016 season premiere tv ad2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="244" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="2"></A>desert,
     when his pregnant wife calls and tells him to meet her at the 
    hospital because she is having the baby. Riggs stops his vehicle, 
    pulls out a sniper rifle from the back of his truck and with one shot 
    overturns the bad guys' truck over 200 yards away. He races to the 
    hospital, not knowing that his wife and baby were just killed by a 
    18-wheeler slamming into her car at an intersection. Riggs loses his 
    will to live after losing his wife and baby. Six months later, 
    22-year police veteran Roger Murtaugh (Damon Wayans; <B><A HREF="bulletproof_1996.htm">BULLETPROOF</A></B> 
    - 1996), who is about to rejoin the Los Angeles police force after 
    recuperating from a heart attack, learns that he has been assigned a 
    new partner. I'll give you one guess who it is. Their first case 
    together is a bank robbery with three masked robbers, one with a bomb 
    strapped to his chest and carrying a kill switch. Riggs walks into 
    the bank carrying boxes of pizza (Murtaugh has yet to meet Riggs and 
    none of the other police know what he is doing) and Riggs eventually 
    kills the three robbers, but sets off the timer on the bomb and all 
    of the hostages run out of the bank. Riggs non-chalantly walks out of 
    the bank eating a slice of pizza and introduces himself to Murtaugh, 
    the bank exploding and one of the flying pieces turns into the show's 
    title (a pretty good effect). The rest of the first episode is Riggs 
    and Murtaugh trying to prove a guy didn't commit suicide, while 
    Murtaugh tries to talk Riggs from acting suicidal in some touching 
    scenes featuring Murtaugh's family, including a newborn baby 
    (Murtaugh had the heart attack in the hospital while the baby was 
    being born!). It all has to do with a pile of heroin, while Riggs 
    takes chances no sane man would take and there is action aplenty. 
    Those who are fans of the four movies will probably like this series 
    because it keeps the humor along with the death and the action 
    (Although Clayne Crawford and Damon Wayans are no Mel Gibson and 
    Danny Glover), but those who have never seen the films will never buy 
    that Damon Wayans is getting &quot;too old for this shit&quot; (since 
    this series is shown at 8:00pm, you will not hear this iconic piece 
    of dialogue, even though the series is Rated TV-14). Action 
    specialist McG (<B><A HREF="charlies_angels_full_throttle_2003.htm">CHARLIE'S
     ANGELS: FULL THROTTLE</A></B> - 2003) directed the pilot and Shane 
    Black (The screenwriter of the first <B><A HREF="lethal_weapon_1987.htm">LETHAL
     WEAPON</A></B> - 1987) wrote two of the episodes, so it is not a bad 
    way to introduce the premise to those unfamiliar with the films. I 
    have seen a lot worse action series make it past one season and I am 
    dying to find out if Leo Getz (played by Joe Pesci in the films) will 
    make it into this series and who will play him. One bit of trivia: In 
    the series, Riggs talks with Murtaugh's teenage daughter about the 
    legalization of pot, a scene which was cut from the first film in the 
    series for its U.S. release (in the film it was a &quot;should 
    marijuana be legalized&quot; argument between Murtaugh and his 
    daughter.), but remained in all the foreign releases. My verdict: 
    Worth your time if you have nothing better to watch. <B>NOTE: </B>Since
     the series delivered Fox's highest fall premiere in two years, FOX 
    has ordered a full season of episodes, if 18 episodes is considered a 
    full season.<B> NOTE #2:</B> On February 21, 2017, FOX renewed the 
    series for a 22-episode Second Season. <B>NOTE #3:</B> It looks like <B>LETHAL
     WEAPON 5</B> will go into production starring Mel Gibson and Danny

    - 2013) having a crisis of faith because he has romantic feelings for 
    the married Angela Rance (Geena Davis; <B><A HREF="fly_1986.htm">THE FLY</A></B> 
    - 1986), whose oldest daughter Kat (Brianne Howey) killed her best 
    friend while she was driving in college, so she took a leave of 
    absence, came home and is beginning to show signs of demonic 
    possession. Angela tells Father Tomas that she believes Kat is 
    possessed, because the furniture rearranges itself in an instant and 
    other strange things are happening in her house. None of this began 
    to happen until Kat returned home. Just as Father Tomas tells her 
    that demonic possession is usually a psychological disorder, a black 
    crow flies into the window and gets stuck, bleeding all over Father 
    Tomas' Bible. Meanwhile, 18 months ago in Mexico City, Father Marcus 
    Keane (Ben Daniels; <B><A HREF="doom_2005.htm">DOOM</A></B> - 2005) 
    is performing an exorcism on a young boy, much to a visiting priest 
    from the Vatican's displeasure (Father Marcus pulls a gun on the 
    visiting priest when he says he is taking the boy to a hospital). 
    Father Tomas has dinner at the Rance's house, where he finds Angela's 
    husband Henry (Alan Ruck; <B><A HREF="happening_2008.htm">THE HAPPENING</A></B> 
    - 2008) in a catatonic state and Kat slapping her father in the face 
    to prove it. As Father Tomas is leaving, Henry mentions that he can 
    find Father Marcus a few miles away at a religious retreat, because 
    the exorcism he was performing on the boy in Mexico City failed and 
    the young boy died. How did Henry know this, since Father Tomas has 
    been having nightmares about Father Marcus' failed exorcism for the 
    past 18 months? Father Tomas drives to the religious retreat to find 
    out if exorcisms are real and if demons can possess the human soul. 
    He is not happy with Father Marcus' answer and leaves the retreat. 
    Father Tomas goes to the Rance household and tells Angela that God 
    spoke to him today and told him that he wants Father Tomas to stay at 
    the Rance House and help them in any way he can (Is this a lie or is 
    this true? You will find out in future episodes.). Almost 
    immediately, Father Tomas has a supernatural experience with Kat (who 
    begins to look like Linda Blair in the original) in the attic of the 
    house, but when Angela comes up and turns on the lights, Kat looks 
    normal and tells her mother that she and Father Tomas were killing a 
    rat (which Kat had partially eaten!) and ends it with, &quot;Don't 
    they say when there is one there is probably a whole bunch?&quot; As 
    Father Tomas is throwing away the partially eaten rat, Mike 
    Oldfield's &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; plays on the soundtrack (the 
    only overt reference to the 1973 film) as Kat (or is it Angela?) 
    watches him through the window as he walks away while Father Marcus 
    puts together his exorcism kit and is on his way to Chicago. While 
    the pilot tries to cram a little too much information into 43 minutes 
    (like the homeless man that seems to be following Father Tomas and 
    why Henry is in a semi-comatose state), this is an effective little 
    shocker that does improve as the series progresses (I was sent the 
    first 5 episodes by FOX as screeners and there are some legitimate 
    jolts and a huge surprise and once you find out who Geena Davis 
    really is, it throws a welcome monkey wrench into the proceedings) 
    and if you like supernatural horror you could do much, much worse 
    than this. I am not going to tell you anything, but the series is 
    full of little Easter Eggs, dedicated to the original film. Just keep 
    your eyes on the background, like photos hanging on the wall and some 
    of the location work. My verdict: A must-see. <B>NOTE:</B> Even 
    though the 10-episode first season has been getting abysmal ratings 
    (about 2 million viewers per episode), the Executive Producer of the 
    series, Jeremy Slater (who is leaving the series), is asking for 
    viewers' help in giving the series a Second Season by using Twitter 
    and other social media sites. With numbers as low as that, it doesn't 
    look like FOX will renew it. The 10th (and maybe final) episode airs 
    December 16, 2016. Too bad.&nbsp;<B>NOTE #2:</B> FOX has yet to 
    cancel the series, so don't give up hope yet. FOX is one of the few 
    stations to give their new series a chance to catch on. A decision on 
    the fate of the series will come sometime in May 2017. Keep your 
    fingers crossed!&nbsp;<B>NOTE #3:</B> Miracles of Miracles, on May 
    12, 2017 Fox announced that the series would return for a Second 
    Season!&nbsp; <B>*</B>&nbsp; The CW's <B><A HREF="frequency_tv_series_2016.htm">FREQUENCY</A></B> 
    (Wednesdays 9:00pm) is based on the <A HREF="frequency_2000.htm">2000 film</A> 
    directed by Gregory Hoblit, where young man John Sullivan (Jim 
    Caviezel) was able to talk to his 30 year-dead firefighter father 
    Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid) using a ham radio. He tries to use the 
    ham radio to save his father from the fire he died in (it was arson) 
    and change time so his father was still <A HREF="frequency_tv_series_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/frequency 2016 series premiere tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="246" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>alive.
     The film had its moments (especially when a cigarette burns the 
    father's table and the same table the son uses 30 years later 
    suddenly has a burn mark on it and the highly emotional ending), but 
    this new show is one of three new series based on time travel (one of 
    my favorite subjects) and is probably the weakest. In the new show, 
    female NYPD detective Raimy Sullivan (Peyton List) is able to contact 
    her 20 year-dead detective father Frank Sullivan (Riley Smith) 
    through a ham radio. Raimy was estranged from her father when he died 
    in 1996, but she tries to put that all aside (sometimes 
    unsuccessfully) to help her solve crimes today and his murder in 
    1996; sometimes using her father to stop the crime from happening at 
    all. But when you screw with time, there are bound to be some 
    changes, some good, but mostly bad (known as &quot;The Butterfly 
    Effect&quot;). Although the new series has a promising premise, the 
    pilot episode frankly smelled worse than fish left in the noonday sun 
    and I am surprised The CW picked it up for series, so I hope future 
    episodes get better. If future episodes are as bad as the pilot, 
    expect this series to be cancelled quickly, even if this is The CW. 
    What surprises me most is that the pilot episode was directed by the 
    usually dependable Brad Anderson, who was responsible for such 
    spine-chilling films as <B><A HREF="session_9_2001.htm">SESSION 9</A></B> 
    (2001); <B><A HREF="transsiberian_2008.htm">TRANSSIBERIAN</A></B> 
    (2008), the excellent <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Vanishing7thSt2010">VANISHING
     ON 7TH STREET</A></B> (2010) and plenty of TV, including 12 episodes 
    of <B><A HREF="fringe_tv_series_2008-2013.htm">FRINGE</A></B> from 
    2008 to 2011. Here, he seems to be directing on auto-pilot because he 
    is really never given anything exciting to do (thanks to a teleplay 
    written by Jeremy Carver, bastardized from the 2000 screenplay by 
    Toby Emmerich). Believe me, when Brad Anderson is on his game, you 
    won't sleep for a week. My verdict: Skip it, unless you have hopes of 
    it getting better. Her father comes back to the present when Raimy 
    successfully stops her father from being murdered, but Raimy now has 
    two sets of memories: Those where her father has been alive all the 
    time and her mother is murdered by a serial killer named The 
    Nightingale, and a second set of &quot;remnant memories&quot; from 
    when her father was dead. How will Raimy handle these two sets of 
    memories (or is all this nothing but a strange time-traveling 
    nightmare?) Anyway you look at it, this is just a series populated by 
    young people, something The CW is famous for. I had high hopes for 
    this, but The CW's insistence on casting young people dashes any hope 
    of making this show different then their dozen other series (mostly 
    superhero related). <B>NOTE:</B> The pilot episode of <B>FREQUENCY</B> 
    opened with a measly 1.4 million viewers. It may survive on The CW 
    with those numbers for a few weeks (CBS, NBC, FOX &amp; ABC would 
    have cancelled it immediately), but look for it to be cancelled soon 
    unless it gets at least 2 million viewers the next episode. <B>NOTE #2:</B> 
    November 16, 2016: The CW announced its MidSeason schedule and it 
    looks as if this series is not getting any additional episodes and 
    will end after the original 13 episodes air, leaving the fate of the 
    show up in the air. The CW hasn't announced a cancellation, but it 
    doesn't look good. <B>NOTE #3:</B> on May 9, 2017, The CW officially 
    cancelled the show. &nbsp; <B>*</B>&nbsp; HBO's <B><A HREF="westworld_tv_series_2016.htm">WESTWORLD</A></B> 
    (Sundays 9:00pm) is vastly different, yet vaguely similar to the 
    famous <A HREF="westworld_1973.htm">1973 movie</A>. I know that may 
    sound confusing, but I think you will get what I mean after watching 
    the first two episodes. The first episode shows the inner workings of 
    the world's most vast and violent amusement park, where people 
    (called &quot;newcomers&quot;; the robots are called 
    &quot;hosts&quot;) pay dearly to live out their fantasies. The park 
    is run by Dr. Robert Ford (Anthony Hopkins), who we first encounter 
    talking to one of<A HREF="westworld_tv_series_2016.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/westworld 2016 series premiere tv ad6 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="168" HEIGHT="246" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    his oldest robots (probably from as far back as the 1973 film, since 
    director/screenwriter of the original film, the late Michael 
    Crichton, wrote this and all the episodes, as interpreted by 
    Executive Producers Jonathan Nolan &amp; Lisa Joy Nolan [J.J. Abrams 
    is also an Executive Producer]). Dr. Ford and his crew (which 
    includes Jeffrey Wright, Sidse Babett Knudsen, Simon Quarterman and 
    others) can control the robots by using certain phrases, but Dr. Ford 
    still has feelings for one of his first creations, an old, grizzled 
    Wild West gunfighter (who zips himself into a body bag after his 
    conversation with Ford, which is a terrific analogy between the old 
    and the new robots, who bleed and &quot;feel emotions&quot; just like 
    humans). The problem is, the robots (or androids, if you like) are 
    becoming self-aware (In the telling beginning of the episode, none of 
    the robots would even swat an insect away if it landed on their face, 
    adhering to the law of not killing any living thing, but at the end 
    of the episode, robot Dolores Abernathy [Evan Rachel Wood] kills an 
    insect when it lands on her neck). All while all this is happening, 
    robot &quot;The Man in Black&quot; (an excellent Ed Harris and, yes, 
    the first episode ends with a Johnny Cash song) travels the vast 
    Western countryside searching&nbsp; for malfunctioning robots to kill 
    (He scalps one of them and attaches the scalp to the saddle of his 
    horse), while talking in smooth Shakespearian dialogue (he really is 
    something). But maybe he is doing something more sinister. There is a 
    lot to recommend here, including a rambunctious Wild West 
    shootout/safe theft set to an orchestral version of The Rolling 
    Stones' &quot;Fade To Black&quot; (other modern songs are heard on a 
    player piano) with a zinger of a conclusion. Also, other 
    &quot;people&quot; to look out for are Maeve Millay (Thandie Newton), 
    a &quot;host&quot; barmaid/prostitute, who is beginning to remember 
    her past &quot;lives&quot; (all robots are recycled from other 
    &quot;worlds&quot;, including one that deals with a mad doctor in a 
    horror film setup) and malfunctioning robot Peter Abernathy (Louis 
    Herthum), who warns Dr. Ford he will not be able to contain what is 
    about to come (Dr. Ford doesn't take him seriously and has him 
    operated on and &quot;fixed&quot;). A lot happens in the first 
    episode, including several ways that robot Teddy Flood (James 
    Marsden) is killed in Westworld and how Dolores may really be falling 
    in love with him. Like I said, the first episode deals with the way 
    human scientists deal with their robots, but the second episode will 
    deal with the exploits of newcomers named William (Jimmi Simpson) and 
    Logan (Ben Barnes), who are there for different reasons. The 
    mysterious Lawrence (the always interesting Clifton Collins Jr.) 
    appearance and purpose in Westworld slowly unfolds. This is a series 
    everyone should be watching, because it is dark (it is obvious Dr. 
    Ford doesn't like windows or real people, but it is also dark in 
    other ways), intelligent and suspenseful (Just where exactly is 
    Westworld located? Is it a real place or a VR illusion?). It is also 
    filled with little tributes to the original film. My verdict: Highly 
    recommended. <B>NOTE:</B> It turns out that The Man In Black is not a 
    robot at all, but human. He is traveling throughout Westworld looking 
    for &quot;The Maze&quot;. What it is and why he needs to find it has 
    not been explained...yet. Also, the story is not told in linear 
    fashion, as the parts with William and Logan takes place decades 
    before the present (For those of you watching the series, think about 
    this. Why don't William and Logan interact with any of the robots in

    It was also mentioned in <B><A HREF="dtv_films_the_good_and_the_bad.htm#BadAss2">BAD
     ASS 2: BAD ASSES</A></B> [2013] where Danny Glover calls Danny Trejo 
    a &quot;Mexican MacGyver&quot;). In this reboot, Lucas Till portrays 
    Angus MacGyver, a brash, braggart of a man (who also narrates part of 
    every episode) who still can make something out of nothing, but we 
    don't see how he does it (Mainly because some of his on-the-spot 
    inventions would take days to complete, yet he does it in 5 minutes 
    or less. The only similarity with the two series is both MacGyvers 
    carry Swiss Army knives. but it ends there). He lacks any humility, 
    which does the audience no favors. At least Anderson had the ability 
    to show genuine human emotions. Also terribly missing from this 
    reboot are the talents of the late Dana Elcar as MacGyver's boss of 
    the secret agency they both worked for (They actually liked each 
    other). Here, ex-<B><A HREF="csi_tv.htm">CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION</A></B>

    of three original cast members left [the others being Robert David 
    Hall &amp; Eric Szmanda], who did 335 episodes [more than any other 
    series regular] from 2000 to 2015, yet the bastard refused to 
    participate in the finale!) is MacGyver's boss Jack Dalton, who works 
    for a U.S. Government secret clandestine organization and blackmails 
    MacGyver into joining it to save innocent lives. There is something 
    sinister about the organization and future episodes may get the 
    chance to expose why, but ratings have gone down as the episodes 
    progress (the first episode got an amazing 10.9 million total 
    viewers, but it is rapidly declining). The pilot episode is a total 
    mess (James Wan, who was a huge fan of the original series, directed 
    the new pilot, as the old pilot, directed by David Von Ancken, was 
    scrapped. And it shows. In the original pilot, Till sported much 
    longer hair.) and, although it has some good action scenes (CGI 
    enhanced, of course), the story is vanilla and from MacGyver's 
    opening narration, he comes off as an egotistical jerk, not a hero or 
    someone you would want your kids to emulate. Here's my verdict: 
    Change the channel when this show comes on, because it defaces 
    Richard Dean Anderson's legacy as the character. I have suffered 
    through three episodes and that is my limit with bad TV. And believe 
    me, this is bad TV. Do yourself a favor and buy the box sets of the 
    original show's seasons. I can't see this reboot lasting more than 
    one season, if that long, if ratings keep declining. But it is a 
    Friday Night series, one of the least-watched days of TV besides 
    Saturdays, so who knows? <B>NOTE:</B> On October 18, 2016, <B>MACGYVER</B> 
    was given a full season order, along with Michael Weatherly's new 
    series <B><A HREF="bull_tv_series_2016.htm">BULL</A></B> (based in 
    the life of the abysmal person Dr. Phil McGraw when he was a Jury 
    Trial Consultant for a company he and a partner created in 1989 
    called CSI [Courtroom Sciences, Inc.], which is still going strong, 
    but Dr. Phil has not been associated with CSI since 2002.), which I 
    will not be reviewing for this season. I just can't stand Dr. Phil 
    because of all the bad things he has done in the past (Google him) 
    and the wrong advice he gives to his guests on his TV Show (Those who 
    live in glass houses...), so I will not promote him in the present.<B> 
    NOTE #2: </B>March 23, 2017: CBS has renewed the series for a Second 
    Season.&nbsp; <B>*</B>&nbsp; The reason why there are no new reviews 
    of premiering TV Series is due to the fact that most networks are 
    giving the new shows a chance and there has been a lack of 
    cancellations, leaving behind a logjam of new TV Shows waiting in the 
    wings. Some new shows that were due to premiere in the Winter have 
    been pushed back to the Spring or Summer and some are going to 
    premiere during the 2017 - 2018 TV Season. The fact is that the 
    networks ordered too many new series and don't know where to put 
    them. The only new shows I reviewed that are probably going to be 
    cancelled are <B>FREQUENCY</B> (but all 13 episodes will air) and <B>THE
     EXORCIST</B> (which may be toast already since at the time I am 
    writing this it is Winter Hiatus and it doesn't look like FOX is 
    going to air the last 5 of the series' 10 episodes [FOX changed its 
    mind and will let it run for the entire 10 episodes]). Neither one 
    has officially been cancelled at the time of this writing (November 
    23, 2016), but there are dozens of new show waiting to air, yet there 
    are no time slots available. This is the first time I ever saw this 
    happen. We are in the new Golden Age of Television, but programmers 
    have to take into consideration that some series are going to be hits 
    (about 80% of new show are just that)., It is just like one executive 
    of a network proclaimed last year: &quot;There is too much on TV to 
    watch.&quot; Most other people made fun of him, only for his 
    prediction to turn out correct. While there are lots of new series 
    premiering this year (not to mention quite a few series lasting five 
    years or more still going strong), only a handful will appeal to 
    readers of this site. That is also something new. All the decent 
    horror/sci-fi/action series are not on the top networks, but on 
    cable, where an audience of 2 million is considered a hit. That is 
    why cable is able to take chances networks can't. Two million viewers 
    on a network, which is about what <B>THE EXORCIST</B> is receiving, 
    usually means instant cancellation, but FOX decided to let it run for 
    the entire 10-episode First Season, leaving other new series waiting 
    to premiere sitting on a shelf collecting dust (Even the Second 
    Season of <B><A HREF="scream_queens_tv_series_2015.htm">SCREAM QUEENS</A></B> 
    is only averaging a measly 1.5 million viewers weekly, but FOX has no 
    plans to pull it off their schedule.) and the fate of the show, which 
    still could be renewed according to FOX executives, won't be decided 
    until May, 2017. Hopefully, the New Year of 2017 will give me 
    something to write about. I still have <B><A HREF="timeless_tv_series_2016.htm">TIMELESS</A></B> 
    to review, but I am going to wait so my readers have something new to 
    read after Christmas. I predict that the top 4 networks will start 
    following what streaming services and cable have been doing for 
    years: Every new show will only run 10 to 13 episodes a season, 
    leaving room for other series to air all year long. Doing this will 
    also cut down on the &quot;fluff&quot; episodes, that are filmed 
    using previous footage because the budget allotted for the series was 
    running low. This way you get all of the cream and none of the crap.</FONT></FONT></P>

    Beside Spike TV&#146;s upcoming rebrand to The Paramount Network, 
    here are the renewals and cancellations of TV Series across the 
    spectrum of TV and Streaming: FX has already given <B><A HREF="american_horror_story_tv_series_2011.htm">AMERICAN

     HORROR STORY: ROANOKE</B> (partially based on a true story; the 
    difference this time being that half the season is shot like a 
    documentary, complete with re-enactments, but the series has not cut 
    down on the bloody set-pieces), is averaging 13 million viewers per 
    episode. <B>NOTE:</B> January 12, 2017: FX has renewed Ryan Murphy

    episode of the Second Season even aired. Wise decision. When you have 
    Bruce Campbell starring in a funny/gory series that doesn't overstay

    children of famous rap stars. It will run for 6 episodes. Can that 
    even be considered a series? Once you take out all the commercials, 
    it is more like a two-hour movie. MTV is also set to air a two-hour 
    installment of <B>SCREAM</B> on Tuesday, Oct. 18, 2016. The Halloween 
    special will pick up eight months after Season 2, which concluded in

     &amp; ORDER: SVU</A></B>, titled &quot;Unstoppable&quot;, from its 
    October 26, 2016 air date until sometime after the November 8, 2016 
    Presidential Election because of the plethora of women coming out 
    accusing Trump of sexual assault (The new date is November 16, 2016). 
    At first NBC wanted to pull the episode permanently, but level heads 
    prevailed. Aren't some of the show's episodes ripped from the 
    headlines? You don't shelve an episode because it hits its mark, but 
    I can understand how they would prefer to air it after the election. 
    You don't want to influence idiots. Expect Trump to sue NBC once the 
    episode airs (Gary Cole plays an excellent fake Trump), even though 
    his name is never mentioned (He fails to understand that once you 
    become important, such as President of the United States, it opens 
    you up for all types of lampooning). That is what he is famous for. 
    And just like most of his other lawsuits, he will lose. He is so 
    paranoid, he is blaming <B><A HREF="saturday_night_live_tv_series_1975.htm">SATURDAY
     NIGHT LIVE</A></B> for influencing the election (Alec Baldwin does a 
    top-notch job of portraying Trump as a buffoon) and demands that the 
    series be cancelled! He wants a 40+ Season series to be taken off the 
    air because he can't stand to see himself lampooned on TV (Even 
    though he was a guest host on the show two times, in 2004 &amp; 
    2015!). <B>NOTE:</B> Now that Donald Trump has been elected President 
    (that was extremely hard for me to type), the episode has been moved 
    again until sometime in 2017, after his swearing-in. Now <B>SVU</B> 
    is kissing Trump's ass and should be ashamed of themselves. Something 
    tells me that the episode will be permanently shelved. <B>NOTE #2:</B> 
    According to Ice-T, the episode may never be shown, not because of 
    being scared of backlash from Trump, but because it was not one of 
    their better episodes, Ice-T says he got paid, so he doesn't give a 
    fuck if it is ever shown (It will probably not be part of the Season 
    18 disc set).; FOX has renewed <B><A HREF="simpsons_tv_series_&amp;_movie.htm">THE

    shown on a local UHF channel in Minnesota, moved to Comedy Central 
    and finished its run on SyFy (then the Sci-Fi Network) in 1999, 
    before 47,000 people donated $6.3 million to see another season (14 
    episodes) happen. Only Mike Nelson will not be part of it. All 
    previous characters will return. Patton Oswalt has joined the cast as 
    a regular and there will be an array of well-known guest stars, such 
    as Jerry Seinfeld.; Amazon Prime has renewed their excellent series <B><A HREF="man_in_the_high_castle_tv_series_2015.htm">THE
     MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE</A></B> for a Third Season. Unlike that 
    revived sitcom on Netflix, this one actually entertains.; Netflix has 
    also renewed Norman Lear's Latino version of <B><A HREF="one_day_at_a_time_netflix_series_2017.htm">ONE

     DUSK TILL DAWN: THE SERIES</A></B> will not continue after Season 3. 
    The network has released the cast of the TV Series ahead of the 
    November 3, 2016 Season 3 finale. Word is that Robert Rodriguez (he 
    directed the original <A HREF="from_dusk_till_dawn_1995.htm">1995 movie</A>),
     who created the El Rey Network will not make an official 
    announcement until the beginning of 2017 whether the series is 
    cancelled or not. He wants to change-up the series and make it a 
    limited series or mini-series, using the same actors they are using 
    now, which would explain why he released the actors from their 
    contracts so they can find other work until a decision is made 
    between El Rey and Miramax (who own the rights to the movies and 
    series).; Bobby Cannavale joins the cast of Season 3 of USA's <B><A HREF="mr_robot_tv_series_2015.htm">MR.
     ROBOT</A></B> when it premieres in October 2017. I think Cannavale 
    is a fantastic actor, but his last two series, HBO's <B><A HREF="boardwalk_empire_tv_series.htm">BOARDWALK
     EMPIRE</A></B> and <B><A HREF="vinyl_tv_series_2016.htm">VINYL</A></B>

    Season. The First Season can be seen subscribing to Hulu or buying 
    the Season One disc set. Worth your time. It was also renewed for a

    2017, that their new series, <B><A HREF="riverdale_tv_series_2017.htm">RIVERDALE</A></B>,
     based on Archie Comics (but much more darker), was renewed for a

    originally cancelled the series in 2015.; David Lynch's <B><A HREF="twin_peaks_revival_series_showtime_tv_2017.htm">TWIN
     PEAKS</A></B> revival series will premiere on Sunday, May 21, 2017 
    at 9 p.m. on Showtime. Lynch directed all 18 episodes and Lynch and 
    Mark Frost wrote all the episodes as a team. There are over 200 
    actors who have speaking parts, one of the few series to claim that. 
    And look for David Duchovny to put in an appearance as transvestite 
    DEA Agent Dennis/Denise Bryson, the same as he did in the original 
    series. This is going to be good. In advance of the reboot [David 
    Lynch is actually calling it &quot;Season 3&quot;], Showtime will air 
    the first two seasons of <B><A HREF="twin_peaks_tv_series.htm">TWIN PEAKS</A></B>

    PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME</A></B> (1992) as a primer for those who 
    never saw the show before or need a refresher course. And Showtime 
    announced that the series will not be shown like any of their other 
    series, which is strange (and unknown at the time of this writing), 
    but just like David Lynch (It has been revealed that some episodes 
    watched on Showtime Streaming, Showtime Anytime and Showtime On 
    Demand may differ slightly from the same episodes Showtime airs on 
    cable. Only David Lynch can get away with that. I can't wait until 
    the box set is released!).; Showtime has also renewed <B><A HREF="billions_tv_series_2016.htm">BILLIONS</A></B>

    after just two episodes. CBS refuses to say the series is cancelled, 
    but it got ratings that would make The CW turn it down. Expect the 
    rest of the episodes (11 of 13 episodes) to be burned off during the 
    Summer or on some streaming service. Right now, I am willing to bet 
    that Katherine Heigl regrets quitting <B>GREY'S ANATOMY</B> and Dule

    revealed that some of the more gruesome scenes in the first half of

    a few customer complaints. Hey, idiots, you are watching a zombie 
    show. Zombies eat people! What do you want the walking dead to do, 
    sit at a dinner table with napkins tucked-in at their necks and dine 
    on the recently dead with knives and forks? Spoons for the eyeballs? 
    Future episodes will not be as violent as they were before and 
    repeats of episodes will have the violence &quot;toned down&quot;. It 
    should be noted that two other Producers of the show say that none of 
    this is true. We shall see when the repeats are shown if what those 
    two Producers are saying are &quot;alternate facts&quot;.).; Speaking 
    of zombies, SyFy has renewed <B><A HREF="z_nation_tv_series_2014.htm">Z
     NATION</A></B> for a Fourth Season on November 29, 2016. Now here is 
    a zombie show worth watching! I have also been meaning to thank SyFy 
    for showing the entire series up to the middle of the Third Season 
    during Thanksgiving Day 2016 and the day after, leading to the latest 
    new episode. A perfect way for those who have never seen the show to binge-watch
     it and make it part of their weekly routine. AMC has also renewed <B><A HREF="fear_the_walking_dead_tv_series_2015.htm">FEAR

    3, 2017 at 9:00pm. I believe this series has had the most day and 
    time changes of any show on TV that I can remember, yet its faithful 
    fans always followed it (all the day and time changes usually means 
    the kiss of death, but this series bucked the trend, along with CW's <B><A HREF="supernatural_tv_series_2005.htm">SUPERNATURAL</A></B>),
     giving up other series it played opposite against. I haven't watched 
    the series in quite a while, but you have to admire a show where fans

    Bryan Fuller has said that there most probably will be a fourth 
    season of <B><A HREF="hannibal_tv_series_2013.htm">HANNIBAL</A></B> 
    and maybe even more. Talks will start in 2017. The rights to <B><A HREF="silence_of_the_lambs_1991.htm">SILENCE
     OF THE LAMBS</A></B> (1991), which the fourth season was supposed to 
    be based on, revert back to the De Laurentiis production company in 
    August, 2017 (Martha De Laurentiis is Executive Producer of the 
    series). Fuller has said that he invisions the series as an 
    irregular-based mini-series, with 6 to 8 episodes each. Mads 
    Mikkelsen, who plays Hannibal, says the series will likely return to 
    television in the next &quot;Two to three years&quot;. That is great 
    new to fans of the formerly deceased series (of which I am one). 
    Let's hope it comes to fruition. It was the most mature series on

     NEW CELEBRITY APPRENTICE</A></B> (if there is another season) 
    because of the remarks of Donald Trump, who is still Executive 
    Producer of the series. I hope the series dies a painful death and 
    Trump will have one less thing he can't Tweet about. Trump thinks 
    Arnold Schwarzenegger ruined his show (the show got the lowest 
    ratings ever), when in actuality, no one wants anything to do with 
    Trump (Trump said he fired Arnold Schwarzenegger a day after Arnold 
    made his announcement. Who do you believe? If you believe Trump, I 
    can make you a member of Mar-A-Lago for just $300,000!). He is such a 
    sociopathic egoist, that he refuses to accept that people hate his 
    guts. Enough so, that they will refuse to watch any TV show he is 
    involved in. My best bet is that NBC will try to keep the show on the 
    air because they don't want to get on the bad side of our batshit 
    crazy President. Those chicken-hearted wimps.; FX has given their 
    extremely weird comedy <B><A HREF="baskets_tv_series_2016.htm">BASKETS</A></B> 
    the green light for a third season. The series stars&nbsp; Zach 
    Galifianakis as a rodeo clown Chip Baskets and Emmy Award&reg; winner 
    Louis Anderson as Chip's mother Christine Baskets (He deserved the 
    Emmy&reg;, showing the right mixture of humor and pathos.).; SyFy has

    and it helped SyFy re-enter its Golden Years, back when the channel 
    (then known as the Sci-Fi Network) had series worth watching. 
    Besides, I am a sucker for time travel stories and this series 
    delivered the best. If I was given the choice of only picking one 
    time travel series to watch (the Networks and Cable have more than 
    three of them this year), I would pick this show. As a way of saying 
    thanks to fans of the show, SyFy will premiere the show&#146;s 
    10-episode Third Season over three consecutive nights, from May 19 
    &#150; 21, 2017 starting at 8 p.m.; Believe it or not, NBC renewed <B><A HREF="shades_of_blue_tv_series_2016.htm">SHADES
     OF BLUE</A></B> for a Third Season after airing just two episodes of 
    the Second Season. I'm sure this makes Jennifer Lopez very happy,

    not holding my breath, though. There is certainly too much TV on TV! <B>NOTE:</B> 
    The CW has given fans a little surprise for both cancelled series. On <B>FREQUENCY</B>,
     Dad was able to fix the ham radio so his daughter could give him the 
    info about the serial killer and murder him, so the present is now 
    all happy (it was a four-minute addendum). On <B>NO TOMORROW</B>, it 
    was shown whether the asteroid was real or not (A two-minute 
    addendum, but you won't get the answer from me!). At least The CW 
    cares about their viewers and decided to end both series properly.;

     which I had a whole season story written. No use in putting it on 
    now. Another time travel series that didn't last. As a matter of 
    fact, all of them premiering during the 2016-2017 TV Season were 
    cancelled this year. This NBC series was better than <B><A HREF="frequency_tv_series_2016.htm">FREQUENCY</A></B>

    the First Season (and was funny as hell), but since his storyline was 
    resolved this season, he may not return for the Second Season. That 
    would be a shame. NBC has also renewed <B><A HREF="taken_tv_series_2017.htm">TAKEN</A></B>

    Netflix loses money on every new episode. This is the fist time a

    question I would ask Netflix corporate offices is how they allowed 
    themselves to gather up such a huge debt and how in the world do they 
    think they will ever begin making a profit? Streaming companies like 
    NBC's Seeso are closing down shop and Amazon and Hulu are doing just 
    fine, but Netflix is going to have to be more frugal with their money 
    and unfortunately cancel some series. Netflix was never one to give 
    out their ratings, but being that much in debt tells me that not as 
    many people we think have Netflix subscriptions. Those that do have 
    subscriptions can look forward to paying a larger monthly bill. But 
    that is like putting a band-aid on a bullet wound.&nbsp;The first 
    major Netflix series to be cancelled is the Naomi Watts/Billy Crudup

    revival, this time being 10 episodes instead of six (FOX said that 8 
    of the 10 new episodes will be &quot;monster of the week&quot; 
    episodes and, according to footage shown at the NY ComicCon, it looks 
    like <A HREF="lone_gunmen_dvd_box_set_2001.htm">The Lone Gunmen</A> 
    will be back!.). The show&#146;s three principals, stars David 
    Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, and creator/executive producer Chris 
    Carter, are back for the new installment. The event series (which 
    rabid fans call the &quot;11th Season&quot;) is set to air during the 
    2017-2018 season (during mid-Season in 2018), with production set to 
    begin in Summer 2017. Now that is what I call the power of positive 
    thinking! Gillian Anderson wants more women behind the scenes (only 
    two females ever directed an episode [over 220 of them] of the series 
    and one of them was Anderson!) and has petitioned Carter to use 
    female directors this season or else she will have nothing more to do 
    with the series after this upcoming season. Note to Chris Carter: 
    Listen to her! She is right and you know it. <B>NOTE:</B> Season 11 
    will be Gillian Anderson's final season.&nbsp;Carter should have

    in it but no one&#146;s ever spoken seriously to me about that (That 
    is bullshit! - Ed.). I always feel that there are more of those 
    stories to tell as well. After three seasons, we pulled the plug on 
    that show but the ratings were still very good so I think that there 
    is a new approach to that show building on the solid foundation that 
    was already there. IF this actually happens, I will kiss Chris 
    Carter's ass in Macy's window! Now let's work on supporting the 
    makers of <B><A HREF="hannibal_tv_series_2013.htm">HANNIBAL</A></B>

    In the early morning of November 20, 2016, supposedly 
    &quot;supernatural educational&quot; cable channel Destination 
    America aired The Asylum's <B><A HREF="haunting_in_salem_2011.htm">A 
    HAUNTING IN SALEM</A></B> (2011), starring Bill Oberst (who publicly 
    apologized for appearing in this film on IMDb) in a 90-minute spot 
    and what they did to this film, even though it was from The Asylum, 
    is not only troubling, it also harkens back to the old 4:30 Movie, 
    where they edited movies to fit into 90-minute time slots. 
    Destination America not only cut out the entire opening credits 
    sequence (except for the film's title), they showed commercials every 
    ten minutes, actually beeped out the foul language (rather than 
    overdub them like most other stations do) and video created the end 
    credits while the final scene played, destroying the surprise ending 
    when Oberst flicks his Zippo (Then immediately went on to the next 
    show). This was the first time I watched Destination America and it 
    will be the last. It seems the channel deals mainly with ghost 
    hunting &quot;reality&quot; shows, like one called <B><A HREF="ghost_brothers_tv_series_2016.htm">GHOST
     BROTHERS</A></B> (renewed for a second season), about a team of 
    Black brothers and their relatives that search supposedly haunted 
    places and sets back the Black race progress 30 years (one of them 
    actually said, &quot;Feets don't fail me now!&quot;). The entire 
    channel plays older shows based on &quot;false trueness&quot; (like 
    Donald Trump), airing series about UFOs and abductions, monsters 
    (especially Bigfoot), ancient mysteries and, of course, haunted 
    structures (many of the shows taken from other channels who cancelled 
    them). In other words, this channel is about as interesting as what 
    comes out of my ass every morning. And what they are doing to the 
    films they show is very close to criminal. If you see a film on that 
    station that you want to see and DVR it (They only show films late at 
    night), remember that you are only getting the Cliff Notes version of 
    the film. The next film to get their Cliff Notes version is The 
    Asylum's <B><A HREF="amityville_haunting_2011.htm">THE AMITYVILLE HAUNTING</A></B> 
    (2011; a &quot;found footage&quot; film with no beginning or end

    A big thanks to the Encore Channels (especially Encore Action) for 
    showing the complete martial arts films of Bruce Lee's short action 
    film career from <B><A HREF="bruce_lee_martial_arts_films_1971-1973.htm">1971
     to 1973</A></B>. They even showed the piecemeal film <B><A HREF="game_of_death_1979.htm">GAME
     OF DEATH</A></B> (1979), in which footage that Bruce Lee shot in 
    1972 was combined with new footage featuring a Bruce Lee lookalike 
    (very easy to spot). When the film was over, Encore showed the 
    complete footage Lee shot in 1972, much of it edited out of the 1979 
    film. You usually don't see pay cable pay this much attention to 
    films made in the 70's. They ended it all with a 1984 documentary 
    called <B><A HREF="bruce_lee_the_legend_1984.htm">BRUCE LEE</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="bruce_lee_the_legend_1984.htm">:

    interviews with Bruce Lee himself and many of the people behind and 
    in front of the camera, it was an interesting take of his life, 
    including footage of a very young Lee starring in a bunch of Chinese 
    &quot;juvenile&quot; films in the late 1950's and early 1960's, 
    before he would become a legend on screen. And it doesn't hold back 
    on how Hollywood turned their back on him, even after his success on 
    the TV Series <B><A HREF="green_hornet_tv_series_1966-1967.htm">THE 
    GREEN HORNET</A></B> (1966 - 1967), which many people remember 
    because of Lee's role of Kato and not the late Van Williams role as 
    The Green Hornet. (Hollywood producers would combine episodes of the 
    series in the mid-1970's as theatrical films after Lee's death and 
    popularity. One of the piecemeal films was called <B><A HREF="kato_in_the_green_hornet_1974.htm">KATO
     IN THE GREEN HORNET</A></B> [1974] and another <B><A HREF="fury_of_the_dragon_1976.htm">FURY

     The End Of The Season:</B> As I write this, it is May 15, 2017 and 
    most of the Networks have decided what will be renewed and what will 
    be cancelled. What surprises me is that only four new Network 
    hour-long dramas have made the cut for a Season 2: <B><A HREF="macgyver_tv_series_2016.htm">MACGYVER</A></B>;
     <B><A HREF="timeless_tv_series_2016.htm">TIMELESS</A></B>, <B><A HREF="designated_survivor_tv_series_2016.htm">DESIGNATED
     SURVIVOR</A></B> and <A HREF="lethal_weapon_tv_series_2016.htm"><B>LETHAL
     WEAPON</B></A> (besides one that wouldn't interest readers of this 
    site, <B><A HREF="this_is_us_tv_series_2016.htm">THIS IS US</A></B>, 
    the #1 new show on any of the five Networks). Two of these renewed 
    series were based on an older series with the same name and another 
    based on a series of movies also with the same name. This is a very 
    bad time to be a Network. because Pay Cable and Streaming sites are 
    producing series that could never be made on Networks and a lot of 
    them are superior to Network fluff. This proves <A HREF="american_gods_tv_series_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/american gods 2017 series premiere tv ad2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="130" HEIGHT="193" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>one
     thing: There IS too much TV on TV and people would rather watch the 
    quality stuff over fluff (although fluff is fine once or twice a 
    week). This is what is going to have to happen if the Networks want 
    to compete: The FCC will have to loosen their over-tight belts and 
    let some things that cable shows do be shown on Networks. When 
    Stephen Colbert gets investigated by the FCC for saying the word 
    &quot;cock-holster&quot; after 11:30 pm, there is a big problem, 
    because children should be in bed and only adults watching. I think 
    we can handle someone saying &quot;cock-holster&quot; (The FCC 
    decided they wasted enough time and did not fine Colbert). The FCC 
    also has to stop investigating Network shows for content because some 
    uptight Bible Belt assholes decide to Tweet that they don't like what 
    they see because it is against their religious beliefs. For Christ's 
    sake, there are many religious channels to watch and no one is 
    forcing you to watch anything you don't want to. Which brings up 
    another valid point: Quit listening to the Internet. They don't speak 
    for all of us and I hate to see shows like <B><A HREF="law_and_order_special_victims_unit_tv_series.htm">LAW
     &amp; ORDER: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT</A></B> completely delete an 
    episode (or as NBC described it early in 2017, &quot;shelved 
    indefinitely&quot;) called &quot;Unstoppable&quot; because they are 
    afraid of hurting Number 45's feelings. All the time and work that 
    went into that episode will not be seen this year on TV. Maybe never 
    any year. I&nbsp; am not even sure it will be part of their Season 18 
    Box Set. This is deplorable. That is not to say that the internet is 
    all bad. At first NBC cancelled <B>TIMELESS</B>, but three days later 
    they &quot;uncancelled&quot; it because of all the fans that used 
    Twitter or some other social networking program to discuss their 
    displeasure of NBC's decision to cancel it. I haven't seen a Network 
    reverse itself so fast. Sure, it is one of those fluff shows that 
    displays a bit of comedy and intelligence every once in a while, 
    proving what I said before, every TV viewer needs some fluff in their 
    week. And this is the show. I guess the point I am trying to make is 
    this: Loosen up FCC and let Network TV get away with stuff you would 
    have never let them get away with before. Otherwise, all the 
    advertisers will be on the Internet, since Pay Cable and most 
    Streaming services don't have advertising. The first quarter of 
    advertising hasn't been this low on Networks in many years. If not, 
    within 10 years, there will be no ABC, CBS, FOX or NBC on the air. 
    And that makes me sad. When new shows are just getting ratings of 2 
    million viewers or less (ratings not even good for regular cable 
    shows), that should tell the FCC and Networks that their days are 
    numbered unless they do something to change the way programs are 
    shown. Since all these Networks are advertiser-driven, it will not be 
    long before they jump ship for a cheaper and more looked at staple in 
    our lives, the Internet. I want less advertising on the Internet, not 
    more. All we will be left with is The CW with their low-rated 
    superhero shows. Do we really want that to happen? I don't. I've 
    never seen a flatter year for TV until this 2016-2017 Season and I 
    hope I never see it again. I grew up with TV and it taught me some 
    valuable lessons; lessons I didn't know I learned until they actually 
    happened, but there is nothing to learn from TV today unless you want 
    to be a gangster and that is so unrealistic, it will get you killed. 
    TV can entertain and also teach, but there was none of that this year 
    on Network TV. The worst TV year in my entire life. Right now all the 
    good stuff is non-Network: <B><A HREF="american_gods_tv_series_2017.htm">AMERICAN

    problems with advertising commercials saying &quot;Food you want to 
    fork&quot; or tell you that your shit stinks, so let the Network 
    shows get away with some risque stuff and let them say 
    &quot;shit&quot; from 9:00pm-on (Remember when 8:00 pm to 9:00 pm was

    will be airing at 8:00 pm starting next Season. That is definitely

    an episode of the late <B><A HREF="aquarius_tv_series_2015.htm">AQUARIUS</A></B>

    moment.&nbsp;Rebooting old series like <B><A HREF="will_and_grace_revival_tv_series_2017.htm">WILL

    (NBC renewed the rebooted series for a Second Season before the First 
    Season even aired. They also increased the First Season from 12 
    episodes to 16.) and <B>ROSEANNE</B> is not the answer. It will never 
    be the answer.&nbsp; *&nbsp; Another thing that really bothers me is 
    that A&amp;E announced after the finale of the excellent series <B><A HREF="bates_motel_tv_series_2013.htm">BATES
     MOTEL</A></B>, that they will not produce scripted series any more. 
    They will go back to making reality series (some of which are more 
    scripted than drama series) and leave scripted series up to other 
    cable channels. Count me out as an A&amp;E watcher from now on. Some 
    entertainment web sites are saying that MTV, Freeform and other cable 
    stations are slowly backing off scripted series and will soon be all 
    reality shows (I remember when MTV began and was nothing but music 
    videos, but they stopped that a long time ago. I bought a lot of 
    music thanks to <B>120 MINUTES</B>.). Now is the time for Networks to 
    put on their big boy pants and step up to the plate. I wish I could 
    delete these channels from my cable line-up, but most skinny bundles 
    contain cable stations I have never watched in my life and never 
    will. Skinny bundles are cheap because the channels are very rarely 
    watched (Have anyone seen the channels offered by Sling TV as part of 
    their $20 skinny bundle? I think I watched just one of them years ago 
    and it doesn't include local channels of the Networks.). Why can't 
    cable give us only the channels we want? Because they would lose 
    money, that's why. What people don't understand, if you add up the 
    cost of Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and other streaming services so you can 
    watch on your TV and see the programs you want (I use the Roku 3, 
    which is an excellent device), it costs just as much, if not more, 
    than what you are paying for cable or satellite service. Add in 
    charges for internet and what you have is a mighty expensive 
    alternative.&nbsp; *&nbsp; One thing that made me laugh out loud was 
    reading that Snoop Dogg will be hosting a revival of the old game 
    show <B>THE JOKER'S WILD</B> daily on TBS during the 2017-2018 TV 
    Season. For anyone who remembers the show, this is how I think it 
    will go now: The winning player presses a button to spin the playing 
    card wheel and Snoop yells out, &quot;Joker...Joker...Joker...Blunt! 
    Here, take a puff off this!&quot; I love Snoop and he's not afraid to 
    make fun of himself, so this game show may be fun to watch. Time will 
    tell, but it's a genius decision to make Snoop the host.&nbsp; *&nbsp;

     SyFy's <B><A HREF="blood_drive_tv_series_2017.htm">BLOOD DRIVE</A></B> 
    (Wednesdays 10:00pm) is probably SyFy's best series since <B><A HREF="battlestar_galactica_tv_series_2003-2009.htm">BATTLESTAR
     GALACTICA</A></B> (2003 - 2009), but both series are like comparing 
    apples and oranges. This new series is perhaps the bloodiest, goriest 
    and sexiest (Although the censors cover the women's and men's naughty 
    bits with black bars rather <A HREF="blood_drive_tv_series_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blood drive 2017 series premiere tv ad2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="207" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>than
     optically fogging them out. The Season 1 Blu-Ray set, when released, 
    better restore all the nudity!) ever on non-pay cable TV and that 
    includes <B><A HREF="walking_dead_tv_series.htm">THE WALKING DEAD</A></B>!
     The premise of the series may remind you a little bit of <B><A HREF="death_race_2000_1975.htm">DEATH
     RACE 2000</A></B> (1975), but after a short period of time it has a 
    face of its own. In the alternate dystopian future of 1999, water and oil/gasoline
     are hard to find and expensive due to climate change, so street 
    racer Grace D&#146;Argento (Christina Ochoa) and by-the-book cop 
    Arthur Bailey (Alan Ritchson) are forced to work together when they 
    are kidnapped and must participate in a road race from Los Angeles, 
    California to Phoenix, Arizona, the losers losing their lives. The 
    rules: Kill as many people as you can along the way, because all the 
    cars' fuel is human blood (and some of the dead are cannibalized)! 
    The more human blood you collect, the farther your car will go (Grace 
    and Arthur have a blood red Chevrolet Camaro). Arthur soon learns 
    that there is no by-the-book in this game, so he and Grace join 
    together and do their best to kill only the people who deserve 
    killing. And believe me, in this future, there are many freaks, 
    thieves and psychopaths to kill, while the other drivers (such as the 
    freakishly weird stovepipe hat-wearing Julian Slink [Colin 
    Cunningham] and ruthless killer Aki [Marama Corlett], a synthetic 
    being created by the ironically named Heart Industries) have no 
    problem killing innocent people and enjoy it just a little too much. 
    The blood flows like water, there are some amazing torture devices 
    and limbs and other body parts fly through the air. There is a reason 
    why this series is Rated TV-MA. So far I have seen three episodes of 
    the first 13-episode season and I have been blown away. SyFy said 
    about a year ago they were going to go back to their past and this 
    series is a good starting point. There have been trouble with censors 
    and the amount of sex, blood and gore shown, but since it has a TV-MA 
    rating (and, again, we will probably see what had to be cut on the 
    Season 1 Blu-Ray set), it still gets away with a lot more than most 
    any series on non-pay TV. This is 70's and 80's storytelling in the 
    New Millennium and I couldn't be happier. I never thought SyFy would 
    keep their promise of returning to their roots, when people use to 
    watch the channel for the old sci-fi/horror films and new TV Series 
    like <B><A HREF="lexx_tv_series.htm">LEXX</A></B> (1997 - 2002) and 
    others, but they seem to be off to a good start with this series. 
    Watch it and be amazed that you are watching this on a channel that 
    doesn't cost you extra to subscribe to. My highest recommendation. 
    The pilot episode first appeared on &quot;The Bloodlist&quot;; the 
    list of the best unproduced dark - genre scripts and pilots of the 
    year. <B>NOTE:</B> The SyFy Channel had to set up a complaint line 
    for viewers to call and vent/complain what was offensive to them. 
    Calling this number gave you choices on which was most disturbing. 
    The voice on the recording is that of Slink. (325) 400-3423 is the 
    hotline for <B>BLOOD DRIVE</B> and was the idea of the censors for 
    the SyFy Network/NBC Universal.&nbsp; *&nbsp; <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">Summer

    her face against a supermarket window with her lower jaw missing at 
    the end of the episode, there was really nothing to offer here. If 
    you have seen the <A HREF="mist_2007.htm">2007 movie</A>, you 
    remember the heart-breaking and surprising climax, as well as some 
    good creatures and deaths, but all this TV Series offers is talk, 
    talk, talk, (so far), with a little horror thrown into the mix. The 
    story concerns a deadly mist encasing a small town and the unseen 
    horrors that hide in it. I will be watching future episodes to see if 
    the series gets better, but from what I have seen so far, the acting 
    is vanilla, the story crawls at a snail's pace and there are way too 
    many people to keep track of. Remember the CBS Summer series <B><A HREF="under_the_dome_tv_series_2013.htm">UNDER
     THE DOME</A></B> (2013-2015), also based on a Stephen King story? It 
    started like gangbusters and slowly developed into a mess of soap 
    opera-like situations and ideas that triggered confusion in our 
    brains. Well, this new series starts off with nothing to offer except 
    to introduce us to the many residents of the small town and the 
    problems they have. Remember when you wanted to rip Marcia Gay 
    Harden's head off because of all her religious rants in the 2007 
    movie? Well, there's also a religious woman trapped in the grocery 
    store here, but she just doesn't have the chops to hate her like we 
    did Harden. I can't see this 10-episode series lasting more than one 
    season unless something amazing happens in future episodes. I can 
    guarantee that those who watched the boring pilot of this series will 
    probably be avoiding it in the future. If you are going to introduce 
    a new series, the first episode has to grab you, not want you to slit 
    your wrists if you have to watch more. But that is my job. To watch 
    shit to tell you if it gets any better. I hope it does, but I'm not 
    counting on it. There are some Stephen King movies that are very 
    good, but I have yet to see a King TV series that was able to 
    maintain interest. TV Guide loves it, of course. <B>NOTE:</B>

     - 2014), only this time, the series is on Network TV and holds back 
    when it should push forward. Just the premise of the series begs 
    ridiculous: The titled town is a safe haven for all kinds of monsters 
    and supernatural beings (called &quot;Midnighters&quot;), including 
    fallen angels, witches, were-tigers, vampires, psychics, ghosts, a 
    gunfighting Wild West preacher and other types of beings of yore who 
    live together in relative peace with each other (If you can get over 
    that premise, which I couldn't, you may enjoy this series more than I 
    did.) until &quot;Outsiders&quot; (living humans) come to their town. 
    The premise is how these creatures interact with living human beings 
    and the pilot (made over a year ago and just being shown now; the 
    problem of there being too many Series on TV) barely delves into it 
    because it spends way too much time spent on introducing the 
    Midnighters in the town. There is a little more blood than you would 
    normally see on Network TV, but not enough to make you believe the 
    premise. At least Harris' HBO Series had blood and guts galore, along 
    with plentiful bad language and nudity, but NBC toned down her new 
    series of books until they are nothing but a shell of themselves 
    (And, yes, I read the ones released, so far). The only positive thing 
    I can say about this series is that it contains some very good actors 
    and actresses including Yul Vazquez (<B><A HREF="southern_gothic_2006.htm">SOUTHERN
     GOTHIC</A></B> - 2006) as the gun-toting Wild West padre; Dylan 
    Bruce (who starred in last year's failed Summer Series <B><A HREF="american_gothic_tv_series_2016.htm">AMERICAN

     DOGS</A></B> - 2015) as Manfred Bernardo the Medium (actually the 
    series's lead); Peter Mensah (instantly recognizable from the late, 
    lamented Starz TV Series <B><A HREF="spartacus_tv_series_2010-2013.htm">SPARTACUS</A></B> 
    - 2010-2013) as vampire Lemuel; Arielle Kebbel (<B><A HREF="grudge_2_2006.htm">THE

    Strong, the fallen angel and many others. This may last for more than 
    one season for the sole reason that it is based on a series of 
    popular books by Charlaine Harris, but I won't be watching it. It 
    just doesn't contain Harris' spirit in the books.</FONT></FONT></P>

    all contact with Spacey, even canceling a biography of Gore Vidal 
    that Spacey was set to star in.; Yes, this Television Season may 
    actually be time to cut the cord and go streaming. Netflix (which is 
    raising its rates), Amazon Prime and Hulu offer first-run movies, as 
    well as quality original programming and both HBO and Showtime offer 
    separate services where you pay about $8.00 - $12.00 a month without 
    having cable, and services like Sling offer you skinny bundles that 
    you can pick and choose channels from, starting at $20.00 a month. 
    Nothing at all like cable, because if you want Chiller (which is now 
    moot since NBCUniversal announced the horror channel will be 
    permanently off the air at the end of 2017), you have to have a pay 
    Cable service for a whole bunch of useless religious channels. And 
    all of these online services can play on HD TV with the right devices 
    (I swear by my Roku 3) and once I did the math, the only bad part is 
    that you may not save as much money than you think. In a lot of 
    cases, you will end up paying more. But your choices are more solid. 
    I have been a cable TV customer since 1977 (40 years!) and this TV 
    Season I am seriously thinking of cutting the cable. The only problem 
    with that is you have to keep basic cable if you want to see all the 
    local channels. I can't go to sleep unless I watch the local news and 
    my internet price will also go up because I will have a lot less 
    channels than I did before. I live in the mountains so using an 
    antennae does me no good. And it is always a good idea to have an 
    internet-ready phone, too, which I also have through my cable 
    company. The monthly price for having that will also go up. So, do 
    your math before making any rash decisions and pick the cheapest 
    service you can get. Cheap service doesn't mean cheap programming. 
    The only real problem is that your monthly bill paying time is about 
    to increase, because rather than pay one company for cable, internet 
    and <A HREF="ghosted_tv_series_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ghosted 2017 series premiere tv ad8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>phone,
     you will be paying at least 10 to 12 different places for the same 
    thing. Are you prepared for that? One other caveat: When you give up 
    cable, you give up renting the cable box and even the remote! All you 
    really need is one remote for your TV (Mine would be the Roku remote 
    with the earphone jack in the remote!). One more caveat: Trying to 
    DVR a program may be close to impossible, but there are plenty of 
    chances to watch a movie or TV show without the use and cost of a 
    DVR. Factor that into your pricing. I pay $14.00 per month for my 
    TIVO.; One other new TV series I have watched was FOX's supernatural 
    comedy <B><A HREF="ghosted_tv_series_2017.htm">GHOSTED</A></B> 
    (Sundays&nbsp; 8:30 pm), which is about as funny as a newborn baby in 
    a barrel full of plastic bags. Really, it stinks. This 30 minute 
    show's two main stars, Adam Scott (<B><A HREF="krampus_2015.htm">KRAMPUS</A></B> 
    - 2015) and Craig Robinson (<B><A HREF="dragon_wars_d_war_2007.htm">DRAGON
     WARS: D-WAR</A></B> - 2007), are actors who I admire, but the plots 
    of the episodes are so badly written (especially the episode where an 
    artificial Intelligence named SAM takes over the Top Secret L.A-based 
    agency called Bureau Underground, who recruit cop Leroy [Robinson] 
    and nerdy scientist Max [Scott] to join the agency to fight 
    supernatural evil forces, and frames Max as a traitor, while it tries 
    to destroy the Bureau Underground) is so unfunny, that I was groaning 
    instead of laughing. The only good thing I can say about this show 
    are that the special effects are better than normal and the Halloween 
    episode had some great make-up effects, but since this show is 
    supposedly a comedy, the jokes are stale and juvenile, wrecking the 
    whole episode. The same happens with the SAM episode. It opens with 
    Max (dressed as a bishop) and Leroy chasing a possessed nun, with 
    Leroy shooting and killing her when she tries to kill Max. There is 
    no background on the nun; it just opens with them chasing her and she 
    can jump long distances. Why? How? We will never know, since the 
    story then switches to the self-conscious artificial intelligence 
    plot as it frames Max. If I were FOX, I would have canceled this show 
    after the Halloween episode because it just gets worse and worse, 
    Scott and Robinson have zero chemistry and the plots are unusual, but 
    destroyed by the writing. This is a buddy comedy that just doesn't 
    cut it and since it follows <B><A HREF="simpsons_tv_series_&amp;_movie.htm">THE
     SIMPSONS</A></B>, it only makes that old animated series look 
    hilarious in retrospect. I never thought that could happen. If this 
    series lasts a single season, I would be surprised as hell. It had 
    promise (think of <B><A HREF="x_files_tv_1993_2002.htm">THE X-FILES</A></B> 
    as a 30 minute comedy), but juvenile humor and extremely bad writing 
    make this show a ghost of what it could have been. There are a lot of 
    bad new network series this season, but the only one of interest to 
    viewers of this site is a total disappointment. Actually, it is a 
    travesty (<B>NOTE:</B> Word is that it is as good as canceled!).; CBS 
    has pulled the plug on its 30 minute sitcom <B><A HREF="me_myself_&amp;_i_tv_series_2017.htm">ME,
     MYSELF &amp; I</A></B> (Mondays 9:30 pm). I don't know what the 
    casting directors were smoking , but the series is about one person 
    through three generations: Young Alex (Jack Dylan Grazer), Mid-life 
    Alex (Bobby Moynihan) and Older Alex (John Larroquette). Not only 
    does Bobby Moynihan look nothing like Larroquette, he is 9 1/2 inches 
    shorter than Larroquette (Who always has TNT's <B><A HREF="librarians_tv_series_2014.htm">THE
     LIBRARIANS</A></B>&nbsp; [2014 - Present] to fall back on. <B>NOTE:</B>

    second actress to accuse Tambor of making sexual comments.), similar

     X-FILES</A></B>&nbsp; (Fox Wednesdays at 8:00 PM) began in extremely 
    poor fashion. It seems that Chris Carter just wanted to wipe the 10th 
    Season cliffhanger under the rug and offered nothing to advance the 
    plot. If he wanted to ignore the 10th season finale, he could have 
    just made believe it never happened rather than offer us this piece 
    of tripe. I can't believe I am saying this about my favorite TV 
    Series of all time, but this episode was worthless. After all the 
    hype, especially Gillian Anderson announcing that this season would 
    be her last, this episode (titled &quot;My Struggle III&quot;) tossed 
    in so many ideas (especially Scully and her son would be the saviors 
    of the world and the 1969 Moon landing was faked!) and offered no 
    payoff. The only thing this episode was good for was the conclusion, 
    where Scully tells Mulder that the best thing they can do is continue 
    investigating the X-Files, bringing back the &quot;monster of the 
    week&quot; episodes that this series was known for before it became a 
    conspiracy series. I'm all for that, but couldn't they have just 
    jumped to one of those episodes without airing this one? It's not 
    like they haven't done this before (some conspiracy episodes picked 
    up a few seasons later!). People that were not fans of the series are 
    probably not going to watch any more episodes of this 10-episode 
    season, which could very well be the last we see of our favorite 
    paranormal investigative team. The 11th Season started out with a 
    wimper and not a bang. Let's hope that it was an abnormality and not 
    the direction the series takes. I am willing to give it a chance. Are 
    you? I Want To Believe. I Want To Lie. <B>UPDATE:</B> I'm very happy 
    to report that the second episode of the 11th Season was much, much 
    better. It contained a story line that was in line with an X-files 
    investigation and brought back some welcomed characters. Titled 
    &quot;This&quot; (directed by Glen Morgan, who helmed some of the 
    best episodes of the series), the story concerns Mulder being 
    contacted by one of the <A HREF="lone_gunmen_dvd_box_set_2001.htm">Lone
     Gunman</A>, Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund), on his cell 
    phone. Langly asks Mulder &quot;Am I Dead?&quot; and the story then 
    moves on about a top secret experiment where a person's mind can be 
    downloaded to a huge server and that person is then murdered; their 
    minds living on for all eternity. Langly then contacts Mulder again 
    and tells him everything is perfect where he is now. Maybe a little 
    too perfect. Langly wants him to destroy the server. Mulder and 
    Scully then find out that this is a government conspiracy to take the 
    next step in human evolution. Your mind can be downloaded in bits and 
    pieces through your cell phone until everything that makes you 
    &quot;you&quot; no longer exists. The episode leaves you with much to 
    chew on, like all good episodes of The X-Files. It also gets it's 
    licks in on the Trump Administration, especially the final scrawl on 
    the opening. Instead of saying &quot;I Want To Believe&quot;, it says 
    &quot;Accuse Your Enemies Of That You Are Guilty&quot;. It also 
    contains some welcome bits of humorous dialogue, such as when Mulder 
    says, &quot;Who needs Google when you have Scully?&quot; Just in case 
    you were wondering: Yes, the three Lone Gunmen are dead. We also find 
    out that Deep Throat's (Jerry Hardin, who was assassinated in the 
    First Season) name is actually Ronald Pakula (a tip of the hat to 
    director Alan J. Pakula, who directed the 1976 classic <B><A HREF="all_the_presidents_men_1976.htm">ALL
     THE PRESIDENT'S MEN</A></B>). Barbara Hershey also returns from the 
    10th Season as Erika Price. Thank God The X-Files returned to normal. <B>UPDATE
     #2:</B> The fourth episode of the 11th Season, titled &quot;The Lost 
    Art Of Forehead Sweat&quot;, was one of the funniest hours of 
    television that I can remember. It was about memory and how it can 
    play tricks on you. Mulder is contacted (using the old standby: 
    Putting an &quot;X&quot; on his window in tape) by a man named Reggie 
    (Brian Huskey, in an Emmy&reg;-worthy performance), who tells him 
    that a Dr. They (Stuart Margolin, who is totally unrecognizable) is 
    working with the government to wipe people from other's memory. 
    Reggie also goes on to state that he and Mulder were once partners on 
    The X-Files, but Mulder has no recollection. Scully (whom Reggie 
    calls &quot;Sculls&quot;, as if they are old friends) is in total 
    disbelief, while Mulder (whom Reggie calls &quot;Foxy-Poo&quot;!) has 
    to think about it more (he even theorises that Reggie may be from 
    some parallel dimension or suffering from &quot;The Mandela 
    Effect&quot;! [Google it]), but it is not the story that counts here, 
    it's the visuals. Pay close attention when Reggie relates his story 
    about how some collector helped him on his quest to find out the 
    truth. In the background in one scene you will see a poster of 
    Richard Nixon with the tagline &quot;They can't lick our Dick!&quot;. 
    I have to wonder if the network censors saw that!!! (The collector is 
    found dead with a lawn dart in his mouth, it's metal tip impaled out 
    the back of his head!). There is also an alternate dimension version 
    of the opening titles of The X-Files, where Reggie is inserted into 
    the credits (Listed as &quot;Reggie Something&quot;) and he is also 
    inserted into classic snippets of the original series (featuring 
    Peter Boyle as Clyde Bruckman and Doug Hutchinson as Eugene Victor 
    Tooms), all of it laugh-out-loud hilarious. I knew we were in for 
    something special right from the black-and-white opening, which was a 
    takeoff of a classic <B><A HREF="twilight_zone_original_tv_series.htm">TWILIGHT
     ZONE</A></B> episode (you'll know the episode when you watch it). 
    Also extremely funny is the flashback Mulder has when he was watching 
    TV as a child. Scully also says some things that are absolutely 
    priceless (&quot;The lemon-lime version tasted like a leprechaun's 
    taint&quot;!). Darin Morgan wrote and directed this episode, just as 
    he had done on the original series' funniest episodes. This is an 
    example of classic TV with a modern twinge. When you witness an alien 
    land on Earth and speak words like our current President (He hands 
    Mulder a book which will answer every question everybody will have as 
    long as they never contact him again. It seems we are sending his 
    race illegal aliens that are criminals and rapists!!!), I am sure 
    that you will appreciate this episode for what it is: a classic 
    example of The X-Files done right. This episode really resonated with 
    me because, the night before, I had a dream that I swear was true 
    from my past, but the more I thought about it, I knew it couldn't be 
    so. Or could it? Memory is a very tricky thing. Just like people who 
    remember comedian Sinbad starring in the film <B>SHAZAM</B>. It never 
    happened. Or did it in some parallel universe? <B>UPDATE #3:</B> The 
    fifth episode of the 11th Season, titled &quot;Ghouli&quot; also 
    resonated with me because I went through the same thing as Scully 
    did. While mainly a story about Scully and Mulder reconnecting with 
    their son William, his adopted name is Jackson Van De Kamp (Miles 
    Robbins) and he can make people see things that aren't there, the 
    episode opens up with Scully waking up from a deep sleep, unable to 
    move (Scully calls it &quot;hypnagogia, the third state of 
    consciousness&quot;). The same thing happened to me recently. It's 
    called &quot;sleep paralysis&quot; and it is scary as hell. You're 
    wide awake, but unable to move and you get a strong feeling that 
    someone is watching you in the shadows. It is a phenomenon that is 
    just recently making news and people who have gone through it also 
    report that they, too, are being watched by &quot;shadow people&quot;.
     While this episode uses the phenomenon to justify William contacting 
    his birth mother Scully, it fairly represents what happens to a 
    person experiencing sleep paralysis. Mine lasted 15 minutes (my eyes 
    were on my bedroom alarm clock the entire time) and, suddenly, I was 
    able to move. I wish <B>THE X-FILES</B> would stay out of my head! 
    Keeping with this season's episode, the opening text does not read 
    &quot;I Want To Believe&quot;, but rather &quot;You See What I Want 
    You To See&quot;, which describes William's powers. Gillian Anderson 
    gives an Emmy&reg;-winning performance, especially when she talks to 
    her dead son's body (just like most things on this show, not 
    everything you see is to be believed).;<B> NOTE #4:</B> The sixth 
    episode of the 11th Season, &quot;Kitten&quot;, finally gives us some 
    vitale background information on Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and 
    why he got involved with The X-Files. Mulder and Scully are pulled 
    into the office of FBI Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens Jr.) and 
    told that Skinner is missing. The uncompromising Kersh blames Mulder 
    and Scully for not allowing Skinner to be promoted because he always 
    backs their play (which is not true at all) and gives the pair an 
    ultimatum: Find Skinner while he still has a job in the FBI. This 
    leads our favorite pair to the town of Mud Lick, where people are 
    dying in booby traps that were used by the Vietkong during the 
    Vietnam War. There have also been multiple reports of people seeing 
    monsters. (The episode opens up with a young Skinner and some 
    military buddies escorting a crate marked &quot;MK Naomi&quot; though 
    a Vietnamese Village. The crate is shot by enemy sniper fire and 
    releases a gas that makes anyone who breathes it in to see 
    &quot;monsters&quot;.). People in town are also beginning to lose 
    their teeth. Mulder and Scully investigate the claims and discover 
    that one of Skinner's old military buddies was committed to a 
    government-run looney bin on the outskirts of Mud Lick. This person, 
    Davey James (an unrecognizable Haley Joel Osment from the film <B><A HREF="sixth_sense_1999.htm">THE
     SIXTH SENSE</A></B> - 1999), was put in the looney bin after Skinner 
    testified against him after the war ended. Skinner goes to the cabin 
    in the woods owned by Davey James (who was released from the insane 
    asylum a month ago) and meets his son, John 'Kitten' James (Osment 
    again). Kitten leads Skinner to another booby trap and Skinner falls 
    into a hole full of spikes (there's a graphic scene of a bamboo spike 
    protruding out of his side). Kitten blames Skinner for his father's 
    mental state (Kitten killed his own father!) and leaves Skinner in 
    the hole to rot. Kitten didn't count on Mulder and Scully to come to 
    the rescue. Mulder manages to pull Skinner out of the hole and 
    Skinner gets into a fight with Kitten, who falls victim to one of his 
    own booby traps. When Mulder and Scully confront Skinner and ask him 
    if they are responsible for him not being promoted, Skinner says that 
    he will always back their play because he has learned to not trust 
    the government. You can see in their eyes that both Mulder and Scully 
    are touched by Skinner's words and they promise Skinner that they 
    will always back him. Skinner was right. The Department of Defense 
    (DOD) is testing out the gas on the town of Mud Lick (At the end of 
    the episode, we see a crop duster spraying the gas on a farm on the 
    outskirt of town). Mud Lick is the guinea pig to see if the gas can 
    be used to turn normal, peaceful people into blood-thirsty murderers 
    (just like it did to Skinner's buddy, Davey James). The episode ends 
    on an ominous note, where Skinner reaches into his mouth and pulls 
    out a tooth (one of the side effects of the gas). Bravo, <B><A HREF="x_files_tv_1993_2002.htm">X-FILES</A></B>,
     on another excellent episode! Rather than &quot;The Truth Is Out 
    There&quot; in the opening credits, it says &quot;A War Is Never 
    Over.&quot; Truer words were never spoken.; <B>NOTE #5:</B> I am 
    never surprised when <B>THE X-FILES</B> tries something different, 
    but the seventh episode of the 11th season, titled 
    &quot;Rm9sbG93ZXJz&quot;, threw me for a loop. That's a good thing. 
    After opening with a self-aware A.I. narrating how learning from 
    people may lead to our own doom, we then find Mulder &amp; Scully 
    sitting silently at an empty ultra-modern sushi restaurant. After 
    ordering their food from a computerized menu, Mulder is dissatisfied 
    with his choice (in one of the episode's most laugh-out-loud moments, 
    he is served a <A HREF="blobfish_photo.htm">blobfish</A>), so he 
    takes his meal to the kitchen, only to discover that all the cooking 
    is done by computer and robots (All the robots stop and look at him 
    in a funny/frightening scene). When it comes time to pay the bill, 
    Mulder pulls out his &quot;Bigly&quot; credit card and inserts it 
    into a slot at the counter. When he refuses to tip the &quot;sushi 
    bots&quot; is when the nightmare begins for our intrepid duo. Be 
    aware that this entire sequence was filmed dialogue free! Scully gets 
    into a &quot;Whipz&quot; driverless car (that she didn't order) to 
    take her home, while Mulder has to rely on his car's GPS system to 
    take him home. The Whipz driverless car turns out to be a nightmare 
    for Scully as it drives too fast and refuses to stop or slow down on 
    Scully's orders. The GPS system in Mulder's car keeps returning him 
    to the sushi restaurant, while his phone keeps reminding him that he 
    has a certain amount of time left to tip the sushi bots (His Bigly 
    credit card became &quot;stuck&quot; in the slot). Scully finally 
    makes it home (And the Whipz app asks her on her phone if she was 
    satisfied with her ride!), where we find out that she has a totally 
    computerized home. Her alarm system refuses to accept her password 
    (&quot;Quequeg&quot;, which longtime viewers of the show will know 
    was the name of her dog) and her nightmare begins. Her home turns 
    against her while Mulder goes &quot;oldschool&quot; and uses a map to 
    get home. Mulder's life is invaded by drones with cameras. Soon, his 
    entire house is filled with miniature drones (they look like 
    fireflies in the long shots!) as he escapes and drives to Scully's 
    house. She also gets visited by a drone (just like Amazon began 
    doing), who drops her off a Roomba-like vacuum called the &quot;Zuemez
     9000&quot;, which causes more damage than it does good (it has a 
    mind of its own). Just before her gas fireplace explodes, she is 
    saved by Mulder (who says in one of the episode's few spoken moments, 
    &quot;Why is your house so much nicer than mine?&quot;). They decide 
    to ditch their phones because Mulder thinks that is how they are 
    tracking them, but they are chased to a computerized warehouse, where 
    a 3-D printer is making assault rifle bullets which fire at Mulder 
    and Scully. They are then visited by a mean-looking robot, which 
    hands Mulder his phone and he finally tips the sushi bots 10%, which 
    ends their nightmare. The screen on his phone then reads &quot;We 
    learn from you&quot; and Mulder ends the episode by saying, &quot;We 
    have to be better teachers!&quot; (The episode actually ends with 
    Mulder and Scully at a packed diner, putting their phones aside, with 
    both of them holding hands while Scully rests her head on Mulder's 
    shoulder.) This excellent episode was probably not seen by a lot of 
    people because FOX did not advertise the show (they spend their money 
    pushing <B>9-1-1</B> instead) because this season has been getting 
    low numbers in the ratings. I laud Chris Carter and director Glen 
    Morgan for trying to be different (a TV show without dialogue is rare 
    today). Having the computers play the Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash song 
    &quot;Teach Your Children Well' is one of the little highlights of 
    this episode and instead of the opening stinger saying &quot;The 
    Truth Is Out There&quot;, it says 
    &quot;VGhlFRydXRoIGlzIE91dCBUaGVyZQ=&quot; which is computer code for 
    something which I have been not able to decipher. This episode is a 
    entertaining reminder on how we rely on our phones and tablets, maybe 
    a little too much. It hits the nail on the head. C'mon, people and 
    support this show! It doesn't get much better than this episode.; <B>NOTE
     #6:</B> The eighth episode of the 11th Season, titled 
    &quot;Familiar&quot; is classic X-Files, right down to introducing a 
    new, eerie killer called <A HREF="mr_chuckleteeth_photo.htm">Mr. Chuckleteeth</A>.
     In the town of Eastwood, Connecticut, the young son of Police 
    Officer Eggers (Jason Gray-Stanford, who was &quot;Lt. Randall 
    Disher&quot; on <B><A HREF="monk_tv_series_2002-2009.htm">MONK</A></B>)
     is found brutally murdered in the woods. The arrival of Mulder and 
    Scully at the murder scene spells bad news for Police Chief Strong 
    (Alex Carter; &quot;Detective Vartann&quot; on <B><A HREF="csi_tv.htm">CSI</A></B>)
     and the entire Eastwood Police Department when Scully contradicts 
    Chief Strong's opinion that the little boy was attacked by a wolf. 
    Scully says it is more likely a person who did this and he (or she) 
    lives in Eastwood (Mulder says to Scully, &quot;You're my homey&quot; 
    when she thanks him for backing her profile, but he thinks the 
    killing was caused by a Hell Hound). Eastwood is a regular Peyton 
    Place, as the married chief Strong is cheating on his wife with the 
    wife of Officer Eggers and Eastwood itself was the site of witch 
    burnings in the 16th century. But what does this have to do with the 
    young boy's death? Chief Strong loses his young daughter when she 
    follows one of her favorite kids show characters (called the 
    &quot;Biggle-Tiggles&quot; a take-off on the Tele-Tubbies) and she is 
    murdered in the same area of the woods as the young boy. Officer 
    Eggers discovers that someone in town is a registered child sex <A HREF="9-1-1_tv_series_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/9-1-1- 2018 series premiere tv ad3 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="231" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>offender
     and he goes to his house, where the crowd cheers him on to kill him. 
    In a case of mass hysteria, Officer Eggers shoots the man in the head 
    in front of nearly the entire town. Mulder makes a discovery in the 
    woods (the young victims were killed in a circle of salt), which 
    leads him to the real killer. But what does Mr. Chuckleteeth have to 
    do with all this? Basically nothing, except that the real killer is 
    using the child's favorite characters to kill the children (Mr. 
    Chuckleteeth is a part of the Biggle-Tiggles Show and in a scene of 
    great horror we hear the Mr. Chuckleteeth theme song with a twist: 
    &quot;Mr Chuckleteeth, we all love you so/Stay with us forever, and 
    never let us go/Mr Chuckleteeth, it's time to say farewell/If you try 
    to run...we'll send you straight to HELL!&quot;, as Mulder watches 
    the TV screen turn to fire. You have to see it for yourself!). Just 
    like most classic episodes of the X-Files, there are memorable 
    characters and a really twisted plot. Mr. Chuckleteeth will make the 
    hair on the back of your neck stand up. The episode ends with Mulder 
    saying, &quot;There's no getting out of this town, Scully. Not these 
    days.&quot;, a none-too-subtle swipe at Trump. Great episode.; Right 
    after <B>THE X-FILES</B> was the premiere of the new FOX series <B><A HREF="9-1-1_tv_series_2018.htm">9-1-1</A></B> 
    (Wednesdays&nbsp; 9:00PM) which was even worse than the premiere of <B><A HREF="x_files_tv_1993_2002.htm">THE
     X-FILES</A></B>. It tells the story of Los Angeles 9-1-1 operator 
    Abby Clark (Connie Britton), as she handles calls of every type (she 
    even gets a call from a fast food customer who complains that she was 
    cheated on the amount of chicken nuggets she received!) and decides 
    who will handle them: Fire and Rescue head Bobby Nash (<B><A HREF="six_feet_under_tv_series_2001-2005.htm">SIX
     FEET UNDER</A></B>'s Peter Krause), who must deal with new team 
    member Buck (Oliver Stark), whom he catches making love to one of the 
    female victims they rescued (she was being choked-out by her pet boa 
    constrictor!), or policewoman Athena Grant (Angela Bassett) who must 
    deal with her husband, Michael (Rockmond Dunbar) outing himself as 
    gay in front of their two kids. We see such things as Bobby rescuing 
    a newborn baby who was flushed down the toilet (!); Athena trying to 
    rescue a young girl who is trapped in her house when some 
    smash-and-grab burglars invade it; and Bobby unsucessfully trying to 
    talk down a teen girl who is threatening to jump off a high rise 
    construction site, while Abby listens to everything going down on her 
    phone (The only thing that registers here is that Abby never hears 
    the conclusion to these rescues since the person who calls usually 
    hangs up the phone when the rescuers arrive). Missing is the 
    emotional impact that we hope to achieve witnessing such heroic acts. 
    It is all done so matter-of-factly, that any enjoyment to be had 
    disappears. Don't look for this to be renewed. We have seen it all 
    done before. <B>NOTE:</B> It seems <B>THE X-FILES</B> tanked in the 
    ratings, but <B>9-1-1</B> delivered over 10 million viewers (counting 
    DVR viewing over three days). It is highly doubtful that Chris Carter 
    will get a 12th Season, even if he did come up with a way to explain 
    Scully's departure. (The Second Episode dropped 29% from the previous 
    week's Season Premiere). <B>UPDATE:</B> January 17, 2018: After 
    airing only two episodes, FOX has renewed <B>9-1-1</B> for a Second 
    Season. <B>UPDATE #2:</B> After watching the series for a few 
    episodes, it has gotten better, but it is still nothing remarkable. <B>JUNE
     2018:</B> I don't know how HBO<A HREF="succession_hbo_series_2018.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/succession 2018 series premiere tv ad4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="172" HEIGHT="231" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    does it, but every time I think about canceling their service, they 
    come up with a new weekly series that hooks me from the first 
    episode. I am talking about <B><A HREF="succession_hbo_series_2018.htm">SUCCESSION</A></B>,
     a black comedy/drama about the ailing Logan Roy (a terrific Brian 
    Cox) and his family of back-stabbing sons and daughter who think they 
    are going to inherit his billion dollar cable news business. Everyone 
    here is terrific, but the surprising (at least for me) standout is 
    the ascerbic son Roman Roy (Kieran Culkin and, yes, he is from that 
    family of Culkins), who pretends that he doesn't care about his 
    father's business, but the fact is he cares more about it than his 
    other brothers and sister. What Roman does when he enters his new 
    office for the first time took me and the rest of the viewers by 
    surprise: He enters the office, pulls the blinds so other people in 
    the office can't see him and then masturbates in front of the huge 
    outside window, ejaculating on the glass with a look of satisfaction 
    on his face, telling us he has finally made it. Also starring in the 
    series are Jeremy Strong as Kendall Roy, the natural successor to the 
    family business, since he is able to handle financial matters as well 
    as day-to-day operations; Alan Ruck as Connor Roy, the brown-nosing 
    son who dotes on his father to the point of obsession (what he does 
    at his father's company party is shocking as well as uproarious) and 
    Sarah&nbsp; Snook as Shiv Roy, Logan's only daughter, who acts likes 
    she loves her father, but secretly hopes he dies so she can have the 
    life she thinks she deserves. This is one fucked-up back-stabbing 
    family and it is fun to watch them sabotage each other. Also very 
    good is Matthew Macfadyen as Shiv's fiance Tom, who proposes marriage 
    to Shiv when her father is in the hospital, after suffering a 
    near-fatal heart attack. Tom fucks with insecure Roy cousin Greg 
    Hirsch (Nicholas Braun) in ways you have to see to believe 
    (especially what Tom makes Greg do during Thanksgiving dinner). 
    Filled with scenes of sharp humor and unexpected violence (check out 
    what Logan does to one of his grandsons during Episode 4), this is a 
    series that will have you begging for more and waiting a week for the 
    next episode makes you think that it is much too long of a wait. It's 
    not surprising that HBO already greenlit a Second Season after airing 
    only one episode. This is one series that belongs on HBO, a natural 
    successor (pardon the pun) to their <B><A HREF="westworld_tv_series_2016.htm">WESTWORLD</A></B>,

     Bad News:<A NAME="ChillerTV"></A></B> Chiller is soon to be dead. 
    NBCUniversal confirmed today (November 16, 2017) that its 10-year-old 
    horror-fied cable channel, which reaches about 40 Million homes, will 
    be put on ice for good at 2017's year&#146;s end after struggling to 
    secure carriage deals with the likes of Dish, Verizon and others. We 
    hear that NBCU doesn&#146;t plan to pull the plug on any of its other 
    networks and that no staffers will be impacted when Chiller goes cold 
    on New Year&#146;s Day. This is a sorry day for horror fans. First we 
    lost MonstersHD, which showed horror films uncut and commercial-free 
    (also being the first to show the complete, unedited versions of <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Burning 1980">THE
     BURNING</A></B> - 1980 and <B><A HREF="from_beyond_1986.htm">FROM BEYOND</A></B> 
    - 1986) and now we are losing Chiller. Horror has always been treated 
    like the bastard red-headed stepchild on TV, even though <B><A HREF="american_horror_story_tv_series_2011.htm">AMERICAN
     HORROR STORY</A></B> and other horror-related shows have been 
    popular with audiences. I think what killed Chiller is that they 
    became the new SyFy of the Millennial Generation, even showing the 
    same crappy movies that SyFy did (Even though SyFy is trying its best 
    to change their image). This will be one less channel where we could 
    watch DTV films that were never shown in theaters and Chiller 
    Original Movies (It's last original film is the <A HREF="dementia_13_2017.htm">2017
     remake</A> of Francis Ford Coppola's <B><A HREF="dementia_13_ 1963.htm">DEMENTIA
     13</A></B> [1963]), which were much more intelligent than SyFy 
    Original Films. This one hurts people! Let's hope that some other 
    network creates a horror channel that doesn't show commercials every 
    10 to 15 minutes and shows films uncut, including bloody gore, foul 
    language and nudity. There are streaming channels like that (like 
    Shudder and Shockwerks), but I would like<A HREF="disney_fox_merger_matt_groenig_illustration.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/disney-fox merger illustration8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="408" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    to see a pay cable station that shows nothing but unusual DTV horror 
    films. The closest we have now is Showtime Beyond, but they show so 
    many repeated movies, some for over five years! I would be one of the 
    first to purchase such a pay cable station. I guess I am going to be 
    using my Roku 3 device a lot more now.; The second season of pay 
    channel Starz's <B><A HREF="american_gods_tv_series_2017.htm">AMERICAN
     GODS</A></B> has been delayed indefinitely because of the unexpected 
    depature of co-showrunners Bryan Fuller and Michael Green, who have 
    &quot;creative differences&quot; with producer Freemantle over the 
    length and direction of Season 2. No date on when the show will 
    continue shooting. Let's hope it doesn't take too long.; Gillian 
    Anderson is confirming that the <B><A HREF="x_files_reboot_tv_series_2016.htm">THE
     X-FILES</A></B>' forthcoming 11th season will indeed mark her swan 
    song as Dana Scully. &#147;I&#146;ve said from the beginning this is 
    it for me,&#148; Anderson maintains in a new interview with TV Guide 
    magazine. Jesus, my favorite TV Series gets a good reboot and now one 
    of the icons of the series announces her retirement. The show will 
    not go on without her! (Although, who knows what plans are ahead? The 
    show ran for two season when David Duchovny left the original series 
    and Robert Patrick took his place.). <B>Now the really bad news:</B> 
    December 12, 2017: Disney has bought 20th Century Fox Studios for a 
    reported 66 billion dollars in stock, which will mean less choices 
    for the TV watcher and some TV series, such as <B><A HREF="simpsons_tv_series_&amp;_movie.htm">THE
     SIMPSONS</A></B> (Creator Matt Groening released an <A HREF="disney_fox_merger_matt_groenig_illustration.htm#MickeyMouseHomer">illustration</A> 
    showing Homer Simpson choking out Mickey Mouse!), will now be a 
    Disney property. Disney already announced that they are not 
    interested in releasing R-Rated movies, so that will mean less 
    variety at the theaters for movies made for adults (and no more 
    R-Rated <B><A HREF="deadpool_2016.htm">DEADPOOL</A></B> films or 
    other R-Rated superhero films, such as the wonderfully human <B><A HREF="logan_2017.htm">LOGAN</A></B> 
    [2017]). This merging of major production companies has to stop 
    immediately. Not does it just hamstring viewers (ever since Disney 
    bought ABC studios, nearly all their shows have awful Disney-related 
    ads and product placements), it nearly cuts what we like to see by a 
    good percentage. If you want to watch adult shows on TV, Fox will no 
    longer be the place to see them (it may mean the end of <B><A HREF="american_horror_story_tv_series_2011.htm">AMERICAN
     HORROR STORY</A></B>, which is a FOX property). They didn't buy Fox 
    News, though. Too Bad. Maybe if they did, there would be little-to-no 
    lies being spread disguised as news. Disney also bought Fox's library 
    of films, so that could possibly mean that the R-Rated films of the 
    past will no longer be released on disc. Let's hope saner heads 
    prevail. No company should own two major television networks because 
    it will destroy TV.</FONT></FONT></P>

    <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">There
     is a debate raging right now in the U.S. Government about the safety 
    of vapor cigarettes vs. regular cigarettes. The U.S. Government wants 
    to ban the sale of vapor cigarettes and yet not do the same thing to 
    regular cigarettes. Here's the way I see it: The government makes so 
    much money from cigarette taxes that they never want Big Tobacco to 
    go out of business, but since vapor cigarettes are slowly but surely 
    catching on, the Government is losing a valuable (to them) taxation 
    item, so they are trying everything in their power to declare vapor 
    cigarettes dangerous and illegal. So they had Big Tobacco hire some 
    &quot;scientists&quot; to declare that vapor cigarettes are more 
    dangerous than tobacco (because they are losing billions of dollars a 
    year to vapor products). That right there should throw up a red flag 
    to anyone with even half a brain. Mainly unscented vapor is more 
    dangerous than smelly tobacco that leaves its smell on your clothes? 
    Vapor that leaves no black spots on your lungs, vs. the millions of 
    people who died of lung cancer or disease because of tobacco smoking? 
    It doesn't take a genius to figure out that the Government doesn't 
    want to lose their billions in taxes due to cigarette sales (where a 
    pack of cigarettes run over $10.00, over half of that going to 
    taxes), due to regular taxes (just like any other item, vapor items 
    are taxed like shampoo and peanut butter) that vapor products 
    produce. Tell the government that even though we all know smoking is 
    bad (same thing for alcohol consumption, which also has a vaporizer 
    that has been declared illegal) for everyone's health, you would 
    rather have an alternate means for people to smoke and not die from 
    cancer. So far, there has been no proof that vapor cigarettes cause 
    the body any harm, no matter what Big Tobacco's paid scientists say. 
    This is just another reason why more and more people do not trust the 
    United States Government. And rightfully so. Show me the unedited 
    data. But we will never see it. The government would rather smokers 
    get sick, so Big Pharm can charge an arm and a leg (literally) for 
    their chemo and cancer drugs. I am an ex-smoker (since 2000), but I 
    look at it this way: If Stephen Dorff can be the spokesmodel for <A HREF="e_cigarette_ads.htm">E-Cigarettes</A>,
     they can't be as bad as scientists say.</FONT></FONT></P>

     The closest I could come to identify it is a dream I had where 
    &quot;Advocate of the Lesser Dignitaries&quot; was spoken by a 
    threatening shadow directly under a sign that contained this symbol. 
    I seem to remember that the dream took place in 1985. I know it 
    doesn't make much sense, but I feel my subconscious mind is trying to 
    tell me something. Something important. If anyone could give me some 
    help, it would be very much appreciated. It will end my nightmares. 
    (Click on the image for a larger version.) <FONT COLOR="MAROON">UPDATE:</FONT> 
    A few days ago, my friend Walter Archinski came to me and said that 
    the symbol is, indeed, real. The AotLD is an actual organization that 
    has been around since the late-'50s. He explained their mission 
    statement and it made a lot of sense. I actually met members of the 
    organization when I was a child, where I witnessed a strange event in 
    my hometown of Wanaque, NJ during the Winter of 1966, which was also 
    witnessed by scores of other people, including the police. Wanaque 
    was (and still is) a hotbed of strange events (Google Wanaque to see 
    for yourself), a lot of them witnessed by me, some of which I 
    detailed in the pages of <A HREF="weird_nj_magazines_ &amp;_books.htm">WEIRD
     N.J. magazine</A> (and their <A HREF="weird_nj_magazines_ &amp;_books.htm#Books">hardcover

    sense, but there is still one thing that bothers me. Arch has been 
    dead for over three years.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

    Mahershala Ali; look for him to add an Emmy Award&reg; to his Academy 
    Award&reg; [for <B>MOONLIGHT</B> - 2016]), as he remembers a certain 
    case that has haunted him, through three time periods: 1980, when the 
    crime happened; 1990, when the case is reopened because a new 
    important clue is discovered; and 2015, when Hays is 70-years old, 
    suffering from the <A HREF="true_detective_tv_series_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/true detective season 3 tv ad small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="206" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>onset
     of Alzheimers and being interviewed by a 20-20 like TV documentary 
    crew about the case. The 1980 case concerns a a 13-year old brother 
    and his 10-year old sister who go missing in the town of West Finger, 
    a hick town deep in the Ozarks. State Detectives Hays and his partner 
    Roland West (an equally excellent Stephen Dorff, who really surprised 
    me here) are assigned to the case and begin by interviewing the 
    children's father, Tom Purcell (Scoot McNairy, who really registers 
    in his role), and whorish mother, Lucy (Mamie Gummer), who was out on 
    the town with girlfriends when her children disappeared and hasn't 
    slept with Tom for over six months (they sleep in separate bedrooms). 
    Long story short, Hays finds the boy's dead body in a cavern next to 
    a Ranger's station, his hands poised in prayer with strange handmade 
    dolls made of straw positioned near the cavern, as if they were 
    markers for some strange religious sect. The girl is never found. We 
    learn in the 1990 segments that the girl's fingerprints have been 
    found at a recent crime scene, which means she is still alive. Hays, 
    who is no longer working on Major Cases, is interviewed about the 
    1980 case and he becomes suspicious about their motives and in the 
    2015 segments, we discover Hayes needs to speak into a tape recorder 
    to remind himself about what transpired the day before, as he plays 
    the tape every morning to &quot;refresh&quot; his memory, but he has 
    no problem remembering the case, because it is forever etched in his 
    memory. This season, like previous seasons, requires your full 
    attention, so don't be doing something else while watching it because 
    you will miss some very atmospheric photography (such as the overhead 
    shot of the fog-shrouded marsh that the police search) and some very 
    unique segues into the different time periods (one concerning the 
    reflection of the moon in a puddle that really impressed me). This is 
    not only a mystery, but also a love story, as the usually loner Hays 
    (whose only friend is his partner) connects with pretty school 
    teacher Amelia Reardon (Carmen Ejogo), who helps Hays on the case and 
    they fall in love, get married and have two children of their own. In 
    the 2015 segments, we learn that she has passed away, but we don't 
    know how or why. What we do know is that she became an award-winning 
    author, her first book dealing with the case and Hays has never read 
    it, but wishes he did, because if he read it now, he wouldn't 
    remember reading it. The old-age makeup on Mahershala Ali is 
    excellent and believable, thanks to Ali's nuanced performance as a 
    man who is not perfect and he knows it. This is the shining moment 
    for the 2018 - 2019 TV Season for me and is the only &quot;must 
    see&quot; show on my list. If you haven't seen it, I suggest you do 
    as soon as possible. It is great television. Once again, Nic 
    Pizzolatto wrote all the episodes (but only directs two of them) and 
    it is as intricate as a plot can get, which is why you need to give 
    it your full attention. HBO is to be commended for turning out one 
    quality TV Series after another and entertaining the viewer in the 
    process. This is not just HBO. This is great TV.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

    comedian Samir Wassan, who can't get anyone in the audience to laugh 
    at his &quot;jokes&quot;, that is until he meets his idol, 
    world-famous comedian J.C. Wheeler (Tracy Morgan), who just up and 
    disappeared after gaining fame, at the bar. He tells Samir that if he 
    wants the audience to laugh at his jokes, he has to put his life 
    under a microscope and mention people who made a difference in his 
    life, whether good or bad, in his set. But he has to be aware that 
    once he mentions them, they are gone forever. So Samir goes on stage 
    and mentions his dog, who he has named &quot;Cat&quot;, in his set 
    and the people laugh wildly, but when he gets home and looks for Cat, 
    his girlfriend asks him what he is talking about, they never owned a 
    dog. The next day he goes on stage and mentions his girlfriend's 
    ten-year old cousin, who is visiting and staying with them, in his 
    next set and kills it with the audience, but when he gets home, his 
    girlfriend tells him she never had a ten-year old cousin and nobody 
    is staying with them. When he mentions a photo hanging on the wall 
    that contains the cousin's image, he then notices that he is not in 
    it. It finally dawns on Samir that whomever he mentions in his set 
    never existed after the set is over, so he writes down the names of 
    people who wronged him in his entire life and then mentions them in 
    his set, all of them disappearing and never existing. Is it murder if 
    the person never existed? But doing this has dire consequences and 
    changes the course of history (when he mentions the name of his 
    girlfriend's mentor in a set, who he thinks is having an affair with 
    his girlfriend, he discovers she is no longer a lawyer and works as a 
    waitress in a greasy spoon!). What can Samir do when it gets out of 
    hand? The only thing he can do, mention himself in his final set, so 
    he no longers exists. This is a very well done episode (it runs 55 
    minutes in length) with a fairly shocking denouement in the final 
    scene (check out the images painted on the comedy club's wall). I 
    have to say if all the episodes are as good as this one, I may have 
    to subscribe to CBS' streaming channel, but unlike most channels of 
    this type, they are only releasing one episode a week and not all the 
    episodes at the same time, so there will be no binge-watching (unless 
    you subscribe late in the series and watch all the repeats). It may

    especially its 5-part miniseries <B><A HREF="chernobyl_2019.htm">CHERNOBYL</A></B>,
     which will be a big winner come awards season. Rather than waiting 
    each week for a new episode to be delivered, I watched the entire <A HREF="chernobyl_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/chernobyl 2019 hbo ad4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="130" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>series
     streaming in one sitting on HBO's streaming channel HBO GO (No 
    longer active, replaced bu HBOMax). Based on the Chernobyl nuclear 
    power plant disaster, this miniseries will not only make your blood 
    boil by the way the Russian government handled this disaster (putting 
    millions of people's lives at risk), you will shed a tear or two (or 
    more) for what happens to some of the characters herein. This is a 
    highly emotional journey into one of modern-day's worst disasters. 
    You have to admire how they show one of the major characters 
    committing suicide (by hanging) in the beginning of the very first 
    episode. In most cases, this would have set off alarms in some 
    viewers who will think &quot;Why should I watch this, I know how it 
    ends?&quot;, but most viewers will want to know why he took his own 
    life. This miniseries wastes no time showing the power plant going 
    into meltdown stage, with people in charge refusing to believe it 
    could ever happen, yet they begin dying in some of the worst ways 
    possible (since this is HBO, nothing is held back, as people puke, 
    have radiation burns all over their bodies and die of radiation 
    poisoning, all in graphic detail). This is not for the faint of 
    heart, yet this is required viewing for people interested in this 
    planet's history and how man can permanently damage it to a stage 
    that is almost irreversible (at least for a few hundred years). The 
    Soviet government still claims that only 37 people died from this 
    disaster, but we would have to be goddamned idiots to believe such a 
    claim. Nearly all the firefighters that came to the plant to put the 
    fire out died from radiation exposure and that number is well over a 
    hundred. Not only will this miniseries give you the facts to what 
    actually happened (it does mix fact with fiction, though), it will 
    make you angry at how a government has very little concern for its 
    people, putting communist party line beliefs ahead of human life. You 
    don't just watch this miniseries, you become involved with it. Isn't 
    that what good television is about? Bravo, HBO, for giving us another 
    winner! </FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">UPDATE:</FONT></B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="BLACK"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">

    recommend Amazon Prime's 8-part series <B><A HREF="boys_amazon_prime_series_2019.htm">THE
     BOYS</A></B> (The series is based on the long-running <A HREF="boys_comics_series.htm">comic
     book series of the same name</A> by Garth Ennis and Darick 
    Robertson, giving the term &quot;graphic novel&quot; a literal 
    meaning). It is an unflinching look at how superheroes (referred to 
    here as &quot;supes&quot;) are packaged for the Internet Age by a 
    corporation based in New York known as&nbsp; Vought-International. 
    This is no Justice League, folks (even though many of the supes are 
    loosely based on them)! The story is very complicated but absolutely 
    fun to watch. It is also very, very adult in its depiction of sex, 
    language and graphic violence, so be prepared to take the trip of 
    your life. During the '70s &amp; '80s, a bunch of babies were born 
    with special superpowers, none of their powers the same as the 
    others. The biggest group of supes are known as &quot;The Seven&quot;,<A HREF="boys_amazon_prime_series_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/boys amazon prime series poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
    led by Homelander (Antony Starr) the only one of the seven that can 
    fly, as well as emitting deadly lasers from his eyes (a twisted 
    version of Superman). Also in the group are A-Train (Jessie T. 
    Usher), the world's fastest men (The Flash); The Deep (Chace 
    Crawford, who is really excellent), who can swim underwater without 
    coming up for air (he was born with gills on his stomach and chest) 
    and can talk to any aquatic creature (Aquaman); Queen Maeve 
    (Dominique McElligott), who is super strong (Wonder Woman); Black 
    Noir (Nathan Mitchell), who is dressed all in black and also has 
    super strength (as well as being an expert with knives); and 
    Translucent (Alex Hassell) whose power is invisibility. When one of 
    The Seven retires, they hold auditions for a new member and pick 
    Annie January (Erin Moriarty), a.k.a. Starlight, who can blind people 
    with a bright burst of light from her eyes and is also super 
    powerful. Annie is about to get a rude awakening to what it means to 
    be a corporate superhero. The Deep makes her give him oral sex, 
    otherwise he will make sure she never works in New York again with 
    The Seven, so she obliges, but it becomes a real problem for her. She 
    was brought up very religious and, although street smart, she doesn't 
    like to be used. The real boss of The Seven is Vought director 
    Madelyn Stillwell (Elisabeth Shue as you have never seen her before) 
    a normal human who controls everything The Seven do, down to the 
    minutest detail. Being a supe is big business, so Vought has a cadre 
    of employees who assign each supe what crime to foil and also 
    controls every aspect of their lives. To say that these supes are 
    despicable is an understatement, as The Deep proved with Annie. But 
    the real story here concerns young adult Hughie Campbell (Jack Quaid) 
    who works in an electronics store and is about to move into an 
    apartment with his girlfriend Robin (Jess Salgueiro). As he is 
    holding hands with Robin at a curbside, A-Train runs right through 
    her, turning her into a fine mist of blood spray and loose flesh. 
    When Hughie looks down he is still holding Robin's hands (and nothing 
    else)! Instead of stopping, A-Train takes off and Hughie is really 
    pissed off that a supe would leave the scene of a crime (and, of 
    course, the cause of his girlfriend's bloody death). Vought's lawyers 
    try to get Hughie to sign a non-disclosure contract for 45 thousand 
    dollars, but he refuses, even though his father (Simon Pegg) tells 
    him they could use the money. Then Hughie meets Billy Butcher (Karl 
    Urban, who is simply awesome), who identifies himself as an FBI agent 
    who wants Hughie to plant a bug into The Seven's office so he can 
    keep a close eye on the supes and hopefully give Hughie some closure 
    into Robin's death and to find out why A-Train was in such a hurry 
    (there were no reported crimes in the area when A-Train killed 
    Robin). Hughie reluctanty agrees and tells Vought's lawyers that he 
    will sign the non-disclosure contract, but only if A-Train is there 
    so they can look at each other in the eye. Long story short, Hughie 
    plants the bug, not knowing that Translucent was watching his every 
    move. Translucent attacks Hughie in the electronics store, but 
    Butcher drives his car through thestore's front window and 
    incapacitates Translucent. Hughie give him a big jolt of electricity 
    and Butcher puts him in the trunk of his car. Even though electricity 
    can stun Translucent, it doesn't kill him. He has an outer layer of 
    special skin that is virtually impervious to any known weapon. 
    Butcher takes Translucent and Hughie to the residence of a man named 
    Frenchie (Tomer Capon, my favorite character in the series) a jack of 
    all trades, who tries to find a way to kill Translucent. They take 
    Translucent to an abandoned fast food joint (called &quot;Tony 
    Ciceros&quot;, who is the actor that played Paulie Walnuts in <B><A HREF="sopranos_tv.htm">THE
     SOPRANOS</A></B>!) and put him in an electrified cage so he cannot 
    escape. Frenchie tries everything to penetrate Translucent's skin 
    with no luck, but he watches a documentary on turtles and hits the 
    jackpot with an ingenious idea. After shocking Translucent with a 
    jolt of electricity, Frenchie shoves some C4 explosive up 
    Translucent's ass, and if he doesn't tell them everything he knows 
    about why A-Train was in such a hurry, he will blow him up from the 
    inside out. That's all I'm going to give away, because this series 
    should be viewed to be fully appreciated. I will tell you one <A HREF="boys_amazon_prime_series_2019.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/boys amazon prime series poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="These are &quot;The Boys&quot;, not the supes!" BORDER="0"></A>more
     thing and it's important: It turns out A-Train was juiced an a new 
    steroid called &quot;Compound V&quot; and Butcher, along with Hughie, 
    Frenchie, another member called Mother's Milk (Laz Alonso) and, 
    later, the silent &quot;The Female&quot; (Karen Fukuhara), a.k.a. 
    Kimiko, who only Frenchie understands, try to find a sample of 
    Compound V and hand it over to FBI Deputy Director Susan Raynor 
    (Jennifer Esposito) so she can shut down Vought and The Seven and 
    expose them for the creeps and murderous lawbreakers they actually 
    are. What they discover about Compound V will change the course of 
    human history. This is only a small sample what goes on here, as this 
    is a very explicit series, full of extreme violence and sex. At one 
    point, A-Train's girlfriend, a minor supe called Popclaw (Brittany 
    Allen) injects herself with Compound V and sits on her landlord's 
    face, popping his head like a grape as she reaches orgasm! Believe me 
    when I say kids should not watch this. One thing I really enjoyed 
    about this series is that Hughie starts out as an inexperienced spy, 
    but soon becomes a better agent than even the experienced Butcher, 
    even resorting to murder when he is threatened. It is also filled 
    with many cameos, including Billy Zane, David Andrews (what happens 
    to him is hilarious!), Jimmy Fallon, Ann Cusack, John Doman, 
    Giancarlo Esposito,Wallace Langham, Jim Beaver, Seth Rogan (who 
    developed this series) and Haley Joel Osment, who portrays supe 
    Mesmer, who with one touch can tell you your life story. Karl Urban 
    is downright brilliant here as an &quot;independent contractor&quot; 
    (not an FBI agent, which Hughie soon surmises) who has a hidden 
    reason for getting even with the supes, especially Homelander. He 
    calls everyone &quot;cunts&quot; and &quot;twats&quot; and does it in 
    such a way that it does not seem derogatory. The entire cast are 
    great and this series was so involving, I just had to binge watch all 
    eight episodes. This series contains a lot of welcome humor (The Deep 
    with a rescued dolphin and a grocery store lobster being prime 
    examples) and extreme tragedy (Homelander and Queen Maeve trying to 
    rescue a hijacked plane in flight, which will just break your heart, 
    especially Homelander being a heartless prick who smiles at the 
    passengers, knowing that they all are about to die). If you are not 
    an Amazon Prime member, this is a great reason for becoming one! I'm 
    not the biggest superhero fan (it's destroying movies and TV, in my 
    opinion), but this is my favorite series of the 2018 - 2019 TV 
    Season! </FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2"><B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">UPDATE</FONT></B></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="BLACK"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="2">:
