     savvy movie executive who transformed Crown International Pictures 
     from an unremarkable independent film company into an exploitation

     president and CEO of Crown at the time of his death and did not want 
     his age to be revealed. His wife, Marilyn Tenser, who survives him, 
     worked alongside him for more than four decades and produced several 
     of Crown's most notable releases. After Tenser took the reins in 
     1973, Crown targeted the underserved teen market that the Hollywood 
     major studios had cast aside with movies that revolved around cars, 
     young men and women and lighthearted sex. The low-budget flicks also 
     played well at the drive-in. Crown was named Motion Picture Company 
     of the Year by the National Association of Theatre Owners in 1976. 
     That year, it distributed the &quot;teensploitation&quot; classic <A HREF="pom_pom_girls_1976.htm">THE
      POM POM GIRLS</A> [1976]; produced for less than $1 million, it 
     brought in more than four times that, making it one of the 
     highest-grossing non-Hollywood films of the year. &quot;Sex can be 
     treated from the standpoint of young people with fun,&quot; Tenser 
     once said. Other films distributed by Crown in an era before the 
     explosion of home video included the action comedy <A HREF="exploitation.htm#Superchick">SUPERCHICK</A>

     International Pictures and New World Pictures. Crown had been founded

     Tenser excelled at throwing the javelin and discus in high school and 
     played football on the varsity team. He graduated with a degree in 
     business administration from the University of Miami in Florida, then 
     came to California to work with his father in sales. Tenser's first 
     job at Crown was as a distribution manager, and his credits as a 
     producer included COACH and THE HEARSE. He was an active member of 
     the executive branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
     Sciences. Survivors also include his sister, Dorothy, and several 
     nieces, nephews and godchildren. A funeral is set for noon on Sunday 
     at Hillside Memorial Park and Mortuary in Los Angeles. In lieu of 
     flowers, his family asks that donations be made to the N.P.

     became as well-known as his comedy. He then became part of the 
     Playboy circuit and made a few appearances on THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW 
     before becomeing a regular on THE JUDY GARLAND SHOW [1963-1964], 
     where he played his goofy self. He also appeared a few times on his

      As you can see by his filmography, Bradford Dillman appeared in many 
     films that will bring back fond memories to Baby Boomers. He could do 
     anything from comedy to drama. I always liked him on TV because he 
     had an intensity like no other actor on ther small screen. Here's 
     what Dillman said about his career as an actor: </FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;I'm
      not bitter, though. I've had a wonderful life. I married the most 
     beautiful woman in the world. Together we raised six children, each 
     remarkable in his or her own way and every one a responsible citizen. 
     I was fortunate to work in a profession where I looked forward to 
     going to work every day. I was rewarded with modest success. The work 
     sent me to places all over the world I'd never been able to afford 
     visiting otherwise. I keep busy and I'm happy. And there are a few 
     good films out there that I might be remembered for. I like as great 
     a variety as possible, hopefully to avoid getting stuck in one kind 
     of character, having to do it over and over again. I seek to 
     challenge myself as an actor -- and at the same time support my 
     family.&quot; </FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN">When Dillman quit acting, he 
     became an author of several books and even was a talent scout for the 
     San Francisco 49ers Football team! Thanks for all the pleasant 
     memories, Mr. Dillman. You were definitely one of a kind. Bradford

     Farrow's character was monopolizing the story lines. She was quoted 
     as saying, &quot;I live much more drama and tragedy in my own life 
     than I ever do on 'Peyton Place'!&quot; She was written out of the 
     show in 1968 and sued 20th Century Fox for breach of contract. The 
     case was settled out of court. This coming after, in 1965, while 
     working on PEYTON PLACE, she suffered a near-fatal illness that 
     included a pulmonary embolism, blood clots on both lungs, an enlarged 
     heart and pneumonia. Upon fully recuperating, she returned to the 
     series after being temporarily replaced by Lola Albright. Dorothy 
     Malone received a Star on The Walk Of Fame On February 8, 1960 at

     took him 8 years to write the songs. Salling definitely had a dark 
     side. On December 29, 2015 Salling was arrested in connection with 
     possession of child pornography. He was booked in downtown Los 
     Angeles. Police obtained a warrant to search his house in Sunland, 
     California where officers found 50,000 child porn images on his 
     computer and a USB thumb drive. This was not his first brush with the 
     law. He paid an ex-girlfriend $2.7 million for knocking her to the 
     ground after she confronted him with a charge of sexual battery. So 
     much for the Christian upbringing. To further add salt to the 
     religious wound, he lied about his age when he auditioned for GLEE.

     Murphy called him out on his lie, but Salling was relieved to find 
     out that his role was meant for an older actor. His death may be due 
     to the fact that he was typecast as the mohawk-headed Puck and he was

     about the Bond films, his other films and how they compare: </FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;In
      the Bond films characterizations are non-existent. Nobody's worried 
     about what Bond did as a child or how his mother treated him--we 
     don't even know if he had a mother! That's not what the Bond films 
     are about. They're all action and fun. But with a film like EDUCATING 
     RITA, it's you and the actors and the words. It depends on the 
     characterizations and the interplay. You don't get to rely on 
     exciting ploys--like a bomb going off. Instead, you rely on two 
     people talking, so those people better be saying the right things at 
     the right time.&quot; </FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN">Lewis Gilbert passed

      me, Los Angeles was the total antithesis of that fictional city in 
     which HILL STREET BLUES took place. I wanted L.A. LAW to be the polar 
     opposite thematically. One show at its core was about despair and the 
     inevitable failure of a kind of system. At the other end, I got L.A. 
     and the land of dreams and wealthy, young, upwardly mobile attorneys 
     who drive Porsches. It's the same legal system, yet these people are 
     masters of the universe.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN"> In 1985, he 
     was fired from MTM Enterprises for his inability to bring in HILL 
     STREET BLUES on-time and on-budget. To a Baby Boomer like myself, 
     Bochco was one of the most important voices of our generation. He 
     will be missed. Steven Bochco died of complications from leukemia and

     was with Star Trek [1966] creator Gene Roddenberry, who had Ellison's 
     famous television script [Star Trek: The City on the Edge of Forever 
     {1967}] heavily rewritten to fit with Roddenberry's more utopian 
     ideas of the future. Roddenberry would not allow him to put his 
     pseudonym &quot;Cordwainer Bird&quot; on the project. To add insult 
     to injury, for the rest of his life Roddenberry took credit for 
     having &quot;saved&quot; the story, which is consistently ranked as 
     the best of the series by critics and fans and as one of TV's 100 
     greatest moments by &quot;TV Guide&quot;. Following a lawsuit, his

     the movie were ripped off by James Cameron and never credited to him. 
     Cameron, in turn, denies having ever been influenced by Ellison's 
     work. However, Cameron's producers said that if he would lose the 
     lawsuit, he himself would be responsible for the financial losses, 
     giving Cameron no other choice than to begrudgingly settle the case 
     out of court. Stephen King, in &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; describes 
     the scene in the pitching sessions for STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE 
     [1979] where an executive kept rejecting ideas, saying, &quot;No, 
     we've got to think big!&quot; Ellison tired of this and said, 
     &quot;How about this? The Enterprise travels light years out of the 
     galaxy, breaks through the wall of the Universe, and there in front 
     of them is the massive face of God. How's that?&quot; The executive 
     fidgeted for a moment then said, &quot;No, that's still not big 
     enough. We need an idea that's big.&quot; Ellison said, &quot;Screw 
     this. I'm a writer. I don't know what the hell you are&quot;. This is 
     what Ellison said about the people who made him famous: </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;This

     Here's what Mr. Roeg had to say about the importance of 
     cinematography: </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;I can't think how 
     anyone can become a director without learning the craft of 
     cinematography. I was very glad later when I was directing that I 
     wasn't in the hands of a cinematographer and hoping that he would do 
     it well. I would know what he was doing, and we could discuss how 
     that scene would look. It was just lucky in a way that I didn't go to 
     film school and just learned all this on the floor.</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">You
      make the movie through the cinematography - it sounds quite a simple 
     idea, but it was like a huge revelation to me. Curiously, it sank for 
     a while when video and commercials came in. Because they had very 
     little story to tell and they just had one thing to sell, they could 
     have magnificent photography but not great cinematography. So quite a 
     lot of people who've come into cinema from the commercials world have 
     had to learn the very fact of what cinematography is over again.&quot;

     Cinergi Pictures, but that company eventually failed in the late 
     1990s. Vajna eventually re-teamed with Kassar in 2003 to form C-2

     permanently damaging his voice. In 2012 Vincent had to have the lower 
     half of his right leg amputated due to a leg infection he contracted

     productions during his life. He holds a place in my heart because he 
     appeared in my late mother's favorite soap opera, SOMERSET [1970 - 
     1976] and we would watch it together when I came home from school. 
     Mr. Sirola's face is indelibly etched into my mind due to that fact 
     and I thank him for it. You made my mother very happy during a 
     difficult time in her life and I have no way to repay you for what 
     you did, so I hope this obituary does you justice. Joseph Sirola died

     (Director/Writer: A lot of people will recognize the name as the 
     director/writer of two extremely effective Spanish horror films, THE 
     HOUSE THAT SCREAMED [1969] and WHO CAN KILL A CHILD? [1975], but in 
     Spain, Serrador was a major TV personality, directing and writing 
     dozens of TV movies and TV series since the early-'60s, none of them 
     ever being shown outside of Spain. Rather than talk about those 
     series and TV films [one of his TV series, a game show he created 
     titled UN, DOS,TRES...RESPONDA OTRA VEZ {&quot;One, <!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/narciso ibanez serrador photo1a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="103" HEIGHT="120" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="Narciso Ibanez Serrador" BORDER="0">Two,
      Three...Answer Again&quot;}, ran an amazing 32 years, from 1972 to 
     2004!], I would rather talk about his contributions to theatrical 
     films, which have been few, but they are pieces of quality 
     entertainment that transcend Spain and were felt all over the world. 
     His first contribution to horror cinema was the screenplay to <A HREF="master_of_terror_1965.htm#MasterpiecesOfTerro">OBRA
      MAESTRAS DEL&nbsp; TERROR</A> [MASTERPIECES OF TERROR - 1960], 
     directed by Enrique Carreras, which turned up in American theaters in 
     abridged form as <A HREF="master_of_terror_1965.htm">MASTER OF HORROR</A> 
     [1965]. His next film, as director/screenwriter was the highly 
     effective <A HREF="house_that_screamed_1969.htm">THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED</A> 
     [&quot;La Residencia&quot; - 1969], a tale of sexual repression in a 
     girls school in 19th Century France. This film evokes sex and 
     violence without dwelling on either in graphic terms, earning it 
     praise, and rightfully so, by both critics and fans alike. His next 
     film as director/screenwriter would be <A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#WhoCanKillAChild">WHO
      CAN KILL A CHILD?</A> [&quot;&#191;Qui&eacute;n Puede Matar A Un 
     Ni&ntilde;o? - 1975], a creepy tale about a childless British couple 
     who vacation on the fictitious island of Almanzora, just off the 
     southern Spanish coast, only to discover that the island's childrens 
     population have been stricken with a rare form of madness. They have 
     killed all the island's adult population, none of them fighting back 
     against them, for the simple reason, &quot;Who can kill a 
     child?&quot;. This poignant, terrifying tale shows us how a normal, 
     loving couple can be pushed far enough by children to make them want 
     to murder the tykes, because they are the personification of evil. 
     This would be Serrador's final theatrical film, but he worked in 
     Spanish TV a great deal until he passed away. His father, actor <A HREF="master_of_terror_1965.htm#Father">Narciso
      Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez Menta</A>, was considered the Spanish Lon 
     Chaney, due to him changing his appearance in nearly every film he 
     appeared in using his makeup kit. Narciso Ibanez Serrador died of

     appeared in, no matter how small the role, because I knew he would 
     entertain me and he always did [except for DEATH SQUAD - 2014; WTF

     was an eye-opening experience for me and the ending hit me very hard. 
     You see, &quot;adults over 30&quot; never understood this way of life 
     and what they didn't understand they destroyed. That's what this film 
     was all about and it is thanks to Peter Fonda, who not only starred,

     this important counter-culture film, that hit teens and young adults 
     with the impact of a cannonball to the stomach. Goodbye, Mr. Fonda,

     never met Ryan in person, but I knew him well through internet and 
     social media correspondence and he is featured among the interviews 
     in my book &#147;Exploring the Underground.&#148; He was very happy 
     to be included in it and I feel very fortunate to have gotten his 
     participation in it. Ryan also had an extensive career in special FX 
     makeup in many big budget movies including FINAL DESTINATION, SCARY 
     MOVIE, THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK, BLADE: TRINITY, and many more. He 
     was also teaching makeup classes in Canada, his home country, over 
     the past couple years and still getting FX gigs. Earlier this summer, 
     it was revealed that Stephen Biro and Unearthed Films purchased the 
     rights to all his directing efforts made under his production company 
     Plotdigger Films. Unearthed will be releasing his films on Blu-Ray 
     starting with FAMINE (never officially released in the US) and the 
     never released BIG FUCKING MONSTER and GUTTERBALLS 2. There was some 
     controversy over the Indiegogo campaigns for BFM and GB2 in recent 
     years with fans not receiving the DVDs and perks they paid for which 
     led to Ryan&#146;s reputation really taking a hit within the scene. 
     Dealing with his illness and all the complications it caused him 
     mentally and physically really made it hard for him to handle the 
     task of finishing the movies and getting them distributed on his own. 
     Unearthed stepping in to help get BFM and GB2 finished and released 
     to everyone who ordered them and never received them will hopefully 
     heal some of the wounds that were left among fans who were upset with 
     Ryan. I made it a point to stay out of that drama and stay friends 
     with Ryan. I never contributed to those Indiegogo campaigns so he 
     never owed me anything. I also think Ryan must have known he 
     didn&#146;t have much time left so he probably figured giving his 
     films a home with Unearthed would probably be best to make sure his 
     legacy is preserved. Stephen has always been a class act, so kudos to 
     him for taking the reigns to clean up the Indiegogo mess and preserve 
     Ryan&#146;s work. I&#146;ll definitely miss Ryan. He was a dedicated 
     genre fan and always fun to talk to. RIP big guy.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="MAROON">Ryan

     Pollard's [real name: Michael John Pollack Jr.] death, what did come 
     as surprising is the total lack of Press his death received, 
     especially here in the States. I find that unforgivable, since 
     Pollard turned in so many memorable performances in films and on TV, 
     especially his groundbreaking role as &quot;C.W. Moss&quot; in BONNIE 
     AND CLYDE [1967], in which he was nominated for both an Academy

     guess that wasn't important enough news here in the U.S., as his 
     death was basically ignored by the Press. But I'm here to celebrate 
     Michael J. Pollard's career so we don't forget his many memorable 
     performances. There was no one quite like him, a cherub-faced actor 
     known for his twitchy, strange acting and a voice that can best be 
     described as the Uncle no one talks about over Thanksgiving dinner. 
     He was a unique person that no one should overlook, an actor with a 
     special blend of creepiness and an air on fun; two things that don't 
     often blend together unless you are Michael J. Pollard. </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">His

     was one of those rare actors that immediately improved anything he 
     appeared in, be it a Movie, TV Series or on Stage. Born Daniel Louis 
     Aiello Jr. in New York City, Mr. Aiello's first gained my attention 
     for his role in Spike Lee's DO THE RIGHT THING [1989], the best film 
     about race relations in the United States that has yet to be beaten. 
     Before that, he was nominated<!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/danny aiello photo1a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="121" HEIGHT="121" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="Danny Aiello" BORDER="0">

     his acting style: </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;I was 40 when I did 
     my first movie. I didn't know what the hell I was doing. My 
     interpretation of acting at the time, because I didn't know how to 
     build a character, was pure energy. People call me an instinctive 
     actor. I used to consider that an insult early on, only because I had 
     never studied. Now... I love it.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN"> 
     Danny Aiello died of an undisclosed infection and was 86 years-old. I 
     will miss his smile. It was so infectous, that it would always make 
     me smile along with him. Sleep well, you smooth-talking devil. Sleep

     could do anything and do it with flair. Later in his life, after 
     having a major stroke and being paralyzed on the right side of his 
     body, losing his power of speech (which he got back with plenty of 
     hard rehabilitation), Douglas became a best selling author with the

     Ambassador for the US State Department [winning the Presidential 
     Medal of Freedom in 1981 and the Jefferson Award in 1983], and many

     which two fellow occupants were killed. He was left with a 
     debilitating back injury. He married his second wife Anne in 1954 and 
     stayed married to her until his death, Kirk saying that whenever they 
     would get into an arguement, they would always solve it with a kiss. 
     Anne is still alive and kicking and celebrated her 100th birthday in 
     2019. It proves to me that true love is ageless. Kirk Douglas was the 
     perfect example of a &quot;gentleman&quot; and I, for one, am truly 
     sad he is no longer with us. I hoped that he would live forever

     with bandleaders Johnny Gilbert, Jim Redd, and a jazz trio. He also 
     did all of his stunts, which worried the makers of THE WILD WILD 
     WEST, afraid he would get injured and production would have to halt, 
     but Conrad was the consummate professional, refusing the offer of 
     stuntmen and doing all the dangerous stunts himself, never getting

     (Actor: Max von Sydow [born Carl Adolf von Sydow in Sweden] was one 
     of those classically trained actors who improved every film he 
     appeared in and was generous with other actors who shared the screen 
     with him. He made eleven films with Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, 
     usually playing a man of few words, telling his life story<!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/max von sydow photo5a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="81" HEIGHT="120" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="Max von Sydow as &quot;Father Merrin&quot; in THE EXORCIST (1973)" BORDER="0"> 
     by using his face and body as a canvas. These films brought him 
     international fame and soon he was being offered roles in productions 
     around the world, including Hollywood. His biggest film is probably 
     THE EXORCIST [1973], where his iconic image as priest Father Merrin 
     standing in front of possessed girl Regan MacNeil's [Linda Blair] 
     home made him a household name around the world. Many other roles 
     followed, earning him two Academy Award&reg; nominations and winning 
     many other awards worldwide. Speaking of THE EXORCIST, many people 
     believed von Sydow to be an elderly man, since his role as the 
     Exorcist made him appear very old, but the truth was it was makeup 
     and von Sydow was actually in his early-'40s! Max von Sydow's credits

     (Director/Producer/Writer: The death of Stuart Gordon during the 
     COVID-19 Coronavirus outbreak came as a complete surprise to me, even 
     though his death had nothing to do with the virus. I was shocked 
     because it actually made the news when all we were getting from the 
     TV, Internet and Cable news outlets was nothing but Coronavirus news 
     and very little else. Stuart Gordon was one of my heroes, a director 
     and writer who<!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/stuart gordon photo2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="113" HEIGHT="120" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" ALT="Stuart Gordon" BORDER="0"> 
     managed to make even the little things scary and funny, as his humor 
     was on the very black side [The way I like it!]. I first noticed him, 
     as did mostly everyone else, for RE-ANIMATOR [1985], the gore-filled 
     extravaganza that was also a very surreal comedy. But Gordon's true 
     love was Chicago's Organic Theater, which he and his wife, Carolyn 
     Purdy-Gordon [who appeared in many of her husband's films and plays], 
     created after he dropped out of college [after being arrested on 
     obscenity charges for directing his psychedelic portrayal of 
     &quot;Peter Pan&quot; as a political allegory at his college's 
     theater] and moved to his hometown of Chicago. This theater was 
     really Gordon's one true love [besides his wife, whom he married in 
     1968], as he loved it more than directing films and it still 
     continues today, even after his death. He collaborated with famous 
     playwright David Mamet on several occasions, even turning his play 
     &quot;Edmond&quot; into a film in 2005. But it is his films that 
     became better known, for their gore and surreal humor, which were his 
     trademarks. But, Gordon didn't only make horror films, he made a few 
     films that stand out in their genres only because of his sense of 
     humor and, sometimes, extreme violence. Mr. Gordon also wrote the 
     story in which the HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS [1989], its sequels and 
     eventual TV Series were based. Stuart Gordon's credits as a director 
     included [Theatrical Film unless marked with a &quot;TV&quot; for TV

      the titles THE INCREDIBLE TORTURE SHOW and SARDU, MASTER OF THE 
     SCREAMING VIRGINS. I became a huge fan of the film, not for it's 
     extreme gore or nudity, but because of its wicked sense of black 
     humor, something I have never seen in a film of this type [at least 
     way back in 1976]. This film earned an X-Rating from the MPAA, not 
     because it was considered pornographic, but because of its underlying 
     tone of helplessness and hopelessness, as the MPAA apparently didn't 
     have a sense of humor or simply didn't understand what Mr. Reed was 
     trying to convey. It's hard to believe Joel M. Reed only directed six 
     films, but he was involved in filmmaking in many ways, usually under 
     pseudonyms, which I will explain at the end of this obituary. Mr.

     2003 for a revival of Eugene O'Neill's &quot;Long Day's Journey into 
     Night.&quot;. Mr. Dennehy was also a serious drinker and had this to 
     say in 1993, when he kicked the drinking habit: </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;I
      used to be a pretty serious drinker. Heavy in defiance of knowing my 
     family situation, which is chock-full of alcoholism. For a long time 
     I was a functional alcoholic, though it never got in the way of my 
     work. But it affected relationships. I never killed anybody, but I 
     made people unhappy, including myself and people who are extremely 
     important to me, like my kids. It's easy to say I had a wonderful 
     time and a lot of great years, and I did. There were some bad times, 
     too. So that was not a major give-up. That time was due.&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="GREEN">

     From now on I am ceasing to add names of celebrities who passed away 
     to this section and will put them on the Home Page under <A HREF="index.htm#LatestNews">LATEST
      NEWS</A>. The reason I am doing this you may not understand, but I 
     feel that I have to. You see, this pandemic has caused many elderly 
     and non-elderly celebrities to pass away from COVID-19 and there 
     really was no reason for this, because Number 45 mishandled the 
     pandemic crisis from the get-go and was not interested in saving 
     human lives, only caring about himself. I refuse to turn this site 
     into a political diatribe (the only place on this site where I talk 
     politics is the Home Page), so to stop myself from blaming #45 for 
     every celebrity death due to Covid, I have to quit posting 
     obituaries. I don't know how long this will last, but I feel it is my 
     duty to do so. I would like to apologize to any of my readers who 
     read my obituary pages on a regular basis, but I will keep reporting 
     on genre celebrity's deaths on the Home Page. </FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">-
