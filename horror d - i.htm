   (1986). After their boat crashes on some rocks during a sudden storm, 
   Paul (Ezra Gordon) and girlfriend Barbara (Raquel Merono) manage to 
   make it by raft to the tiny fishing village of Imboca. Paul charters 
   a fishing boat to go back to his boat to rescue his friends while 
   Barbara goes off with the local priest to get the police. When Paul gets<A HREF="dagon_2001b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dagon small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="210" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   to his boat, he finds his friends missing and when he gets back to 
   shore he finds that Barbara has also gone missing. The residents of 
   Imboca start pursuing Paul as he starts to realize that these are not 
   normal people. They are a misshapen, deformed lot, with tentacles for 
   hands, gills on their necks and sunken, bulging eyes. While Paul is 
   hiding from these mutants, he meets the town drunk (Francisco Rabal 
   in his final performance), the last human resident alive in Imboca. 
   He tells Paul the story of how this town became this way: When he was 
   a boy, the town was going through tough times. There were no fish to 
   be caught and the people were getting desperate. The people rejected 
   God and began worshipping Dagon, an undersea creature/deity who 
   promises them gold in return for their obedience and faith. Soon, the 
   fishing nets are bringing up gold artifacts and the people are happy 
   (and rich). But this type of happiness comes with a price. Dagon 
   begins demanding human sacrifices and the people start mutating into 
   what Paul sees today. It seems Barbara has been chosen to be Dagon's 
   bride and bear his children. Paul tries to stop this from happening 
   and also must deal with the strange feeling that he's been here 
   before (he has recurring dreams about swimming underwater into a 
   strange symbol-filled cavern). This film has a dream-like quality 
   which you don't find in most horror films. The constant rain and 
   weird set pieces make this film seem like one long fever dream, but 
   without the lapses in logic. Stuart Gordon is masterful here, slowly 
   pulling you into his world, not giving away too much information 
   until you need to know it. The town of Imboca is the main star here, 
   with its' dark cobblestone streets, dank rain-soaked houses and total 
   lack of humanity. The hotel is not fit for human occupancy as Paul 
   soon finds out when he first steps into town. Things go downhill very 
   quickly for him soon after. I know what you're thinking: &quot;What 
   about the blood?&quot; I'm glad to report that there's plenty on hand 
   here, some pushing the boundries of its' R rating. Francisco Rabal's 
   skinning alive is particularly cringe-inducing as is the shocking 
   death of Barbara (sorry, spoiler!) and other surprise bits, including 
   the unmasking of some of the mutants (including the High Priestess, 
   played by Macarena Gomez, who has a thing for Paul). <B><A HREF="dagon_3.htm">DAGON</A></B>

    TOWER</A><A NAME="DarkTower1987"></A> (1987) -</B> Failed horror 
   film that is better known for its troubled production history. 
   Producer Sandy Howard replaced Freddie Francis (<B><A HREF="tales_from_the_crypt_1972.htm">TALES

    III</A></B> (which was made a full year later!), severe deja-vu is 
   about to set in. The construction of a new highrise tower in 
   Barcelona, Spain is plagued with many mysterious accidents; such as 
   when a window washer is supernaturally attacked by some unknown force 
   after watching Unico Ltd. architect Carolyn Page (Jenny Agutter; <B><A HREF="logans_run_1976c.htm">LOGAN'S

   (Michael Moriarity; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BloodLink1983">BLOOD LINK</A></B> 
   - 1982), is called in to investigate and finds Carolyn's story hard

   washer committed suicide), yet he begins to have strange psy<A HREF="dark_tower_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dark tower vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="156" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>chic
    visions from the moment he steps into the building (like having sex 
   with Carolyn, a woman he has just met). A security guard is the next 
   to be killed when the elevator he is riding in develops a mind of its 
   own and freefalls 30 stories. Carolyn can feel that something is 
   wrong with the building when the windows start bleeding and her 
   office door handle jiggles by itself. When Dennis' partner, Williams 
   (Robert Sherman), investigates the elevator death, he becomes 
   possessed, pulls out his gun and begins randomly shooting at people 
   exiting the elevator, almost killing Carolyn before an injured guard 
   shoots him in the back. Dennis is rightfully perturbed 
   (&quot;Something screwy is going on here!&quot;), but when he starts 
   seeing ghosts, he begins to look into Carolyn's background and the 
   building's history. It turns out that the ghost he has been seeing is 
   Carolyn's dead husband, who passed away two years earlier. Dennis' 
   visions come much more frequently, including one of Carolyn running 
   through the hallways of the building; her clothes all torn and 
   disheveled. Dennis asks his girlfriend, Elaine (Anne Lockhart; <B><A HREF="troll_1986.htm">TROLL</A></B> 
   - 1986, also starring Moriarity), to dig up some dirt on Carolyn's 
   dead husband and she finds Maria (Patch Mackenzie; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#GraduationDay1981">GRADUATION
    DAY</A></B> - 1981), who tells Dennis that Carolyn's husband was a 
   &quot;prick&quot; and he drowned, yet his body was never found. It 
   also seems that Carolyn may be responsible for his death and probably 
   tried to kill him two times previously, but failed. Dennis contacts 
   prominent parapsychologist Dr. Max Gold (Theodore Bikel), where we 
   discover that Dennis has strong psychic powers called 
   &quot;precognition&quot; (well, duh!). The doctor agrees to help 
   Dennis uncover the truth and he begins interviewing Carolyn's 
   executive assistant, Tilly Ambrose (Carol Lynley; <B><A HREF="beware_the_blob_1977.htm">BEWARE!
    THE BLOB</A></B> - 1972), who doesn't like the questions the doctor 
   is asking. When Carolyn shows up at Dennis' apartment and Max tries 
   to interview her, she hurries out the door mumbling stuff about 
   &quot;witch doctors and gypsies&quot; (a bad looping job obviously 
   done by someone other than Ms. Agutter). Max enters the haunted 
   building on his own, detects a supernatural presence and is nearly 
   killed in an elevator. Max asks a real medium named Sergie (Kevin 
   McCarthy; <B><A HREF="invasion_of_the_body_snatchers_1956.htm">INVASION
    OF THE BODY SNATCHERS</A></B> - 1956) to help him and Dennis unravel 
   the mystery and, in the finale, most of them die as Dennis becomes 
   possessed by Carolyn's dead hubby, turns into a prune-faced demon and 
   makes Carolyn pay for her murderous sins.&nbsp; There's not much to 
   recommend here since the film moves at a snail's pace (there's an 
   awful lot of extraneous elevator footage here, much of it used to 
   bridge scenes that were apparently not finished) and the actors, 
   especially Michael Moriarity and Jenny Agutter, look bored beyond 
   tears to be starring in what is obviously a troubled set. It's not 
   only obvious very early on what is going on at the building; it's so 
   easy to figure out, a nine year-old could guess it and probably write 
   a better screenplay (which is credited to Ken Blackwell, Robert J. 
   Avrech and Ken Wiederhorn). The final third of the film is severely 
   disjointed and makes very little sense, especially the participation 
   of Kevin McCarthy, who is supposed to be a world-class medium, but 
   all he does is walk around the building in a drunken haze. Add to 
   that a violence level that is very low (most of the killings occur 
   off-screen), absolutely no nudity and a storyline that just meanders 
   along until its uneventful conclusion, and <B>DARK TOWER</B> is 
   nothing more than a failed supernatural thriller whose 
   behind-the-scenes controversy is far more interesting than the film 
   itself. Also starring Rick Azulay, Radmiro Oliveros and Josh Batalla.

   walking dead, just in time for the Hawaiian Hula Prom at Cosa High 
   School. Before that happens, though, we are introduced to the 
   students and faculty of the high school, including: Jimmy (Jared

   hours before the prom; Steven (Chandler Darby), the leader of the 
   Sci-Fi Club who never goes anywhere without a video camera attached

    eat Gwen's new boyfriend as they are necking in the cemetery and 
   chowing-down on a member of the Sci-Fi Club when they are filming an 
   amateur horror video, Jimmy teams with Kyle and Gwen and make their 
   way to Lindsey and Steven, who escape the graveyard and hole-up with 
   the remainder of the geeky Sci-Fi Club. Along the way, Jimmy 
   discovers that the nuclear power plant has been illegally dumping 
   waste in the sewers, which is causing everything dead to come back to 
   life (including a dissected frog in Biology class, which jumps down 
   the throat of cruel teacher Mr. Hammond [Jonathan Spencer], turning 
   him into a zombie). When Jimmy and the gang get to the house that 
   Lindsey is hiding in, they discover that it is actually a funeral 
   home, which makes everyone's lives a little bit harder, as they not 
   only have to fend-off the zombies outside, they must also contend 
   with the dead customers inside. Kyle becomes the first victim, bitten 
   on the neck and turning into a zombie, forcing Jimmy to kill him with 
   repeated blows to the head with a pipe. The survivors steal a hearse 
   and head to the prom and on their way discover that Nash Rambler and 
   his band have found a way to neutralize the zombies for a short 
   period of time: Playing their music live! With the help of football 
   Coach Keel (Mark Oliver; <B><A HREF="sleepaway_camp_3_1989.htm">SLEEPAWAY
    CAMP III: TEENAGE WASTELAND</A></B> - 1988) and his arsenal of 
   weapons, they all head to the prom for the ultimate battle.&nbsp; I 
   must say I was quite impressed with this gory horror comedy. Director 
   Gregg Bishop (<B><A HREF="other_side_2006.htm">THE OTHER SIDE</A></B> 
   - 2006) and screenwriter Joe Ballarini (also the 2nd Unit Director) 
   have fashioned a very funny flick (with lots of name-dropping, 
   including a couple of funny lines of dialogue involving Craig's List 
   and Red Bull) without skimping on the red stuff. Particularly 
   impressive is Greyson Chadwick as Lindsey, a character who is so 
   religious, she demands that everyone forms a prayer circle before the 
   climatic battle and also refuses to swear, using the term 
   &quot;effin&quot; every time she wants to say &quot;fuck&quot;. She's 
   a hoot-and-a-half to watch, especially when she has a weapon in her 
   hand killing zombies left and right (It seems religion doesn't get in 
   the way of killing, as long as those being killed are already dead!). 
   There are a lot of impressive kills on view, all imaginatively done 
   and gory as hell, with plenty of decapitations and other head 
   violence, appendage-yanking, a funny scene of a body being torn in 
   half and a really nasty tongue-biting scene, followed immediately by 
   some hilarious hot zombie sex. There's a fine line that is usually 
   crossed in these horror comedies, where the humor detracts from the 
   horror and vice versa. I'm glad to say that this is not the case with <B><A HREF="dance_of_the_dead_2008b.htm">DANCE
    OF THE DEAD</A></B>. It finds that rare balance where the laughs and 
   blood actually compliment each other. I know I am probably going to 
   get a lot of angry emails for saying this, but I haven't enjoyed a 
   zombie comedy this much since <B><A HREF="return_of_the_living_dead_1986.htm">RETURN

   producing, writing and starring in a zombie horror film. And wouldn't 
   you know it, besides the clumsy direction, badly-recorded sound and 
   general ultra-low-budget look, this film actually has some effective 
   moments. Engaged couple Jeffrey (Joe Estevez) and Renee (Amanda 
   Bauman) buy a house sight-unseen in the California desert at a place 
   called Heaven Valley, not aware that the previous occupants, a 
   Mexican family, were savagely shotgunned to death by an unknown 
   assailant. Renee instantly falls in love with the place, but she soon 
   begins having visions of the Mexican family being murdered and a dead 
   little girl keeps showing her visions of things past and future. 
   Renee also finds some Mayan artifacts scattered throughout the 
   property and brings them into the house, which is also festooned with 
   Mayan artwork on the walls. <A HREF="dawn_of_the_living_dead_2004.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dawn of the living dead dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>In
    the sky, a rare aligning of the planets is taking place and the dead 
   Mexican family rise from their unmarked graves in the desert as 
   bloodthirsty zombies and begin their path of destruction by eating a 
   couple of &quot;jackals&quot; (Steven Bracy and Carrie Gonzalez, who 
   has a nude scene) and the two wetbacks they have tied-up. Renee finds 
   a book and homemade CD that explains that when all the planets align, 
   the people that died an unjust death will rise from their graves to 
   get their revenge. Renee meets electric windmill operator Michael 
   Richards (Heavener) on one of her daily walks and invites him to 
   dinner. At dinner, Renee reveals that she spent the last two years in 
   a mental institution after her daughter (from a previous marriage) 
   was killed by a drunk driver. Jeffrey was the doctor that helped her 
   regain her sanity and they've been a couple ever since. Michael 
   reveals to Renee and Jeffrey that the house they are living in use to 
   be a safehouse for wetbacks that illegally crossed the border (he 
   also makes his hatred of Mexicans known to the couple). To make a 
   long story short, Jeffrey gets drunk and jealous and then tries to 
   rape Renee, Michael and Renee begin an affair and Jeffrey is 
   graphically devoured by the zombie family. Renee and Michael must 
   defend themselves from the zombie horde, but a twist in the story 
   shows that not everyone is as good as they pretend to be.&nbsp; This 
   cheapjack production is actually enjoyable if you ignore the gaping 
   plot holes and just go along for the ride. While the acting is 
   nothing to write home about (Can it be possible that Joe Estevez 
   actually has no talent?), I've definitely seen worse and some of the 
   zombie effects are pretty gory, including Estevez's head being torn 
   off and the birth of a zombie baby, who gets revenge on his daddy, in

    OF THE ANIMALS</A><A NAME="DayOfAnimals1976"></A> (1976) -</B> The 
   first thing that came to mind when I inserted this Blu-Ray of the 
   PG-Rated &quot;nature gone amuck&quot; horror film into my player was 
   that how many of the main stars are no longer with us (Only two are 
   still alive!). The director also passed away in a helicopter crash 
   (he was only 30 years-old) after making one more film (<B><A HREF="manitou_1977.htm">THE
    MANITOU</A></B> - 1977), which was released theatrically in the U.S. 
   three months after his death in January 1978. This film was very sad 
   for me to watch; not that it is a bad film (far from it), but because 
   I always was an ardent fan of the director and all of the deceased 
   actors (who appeared in many of the director's films).

   premise for this film is very 1970s: Because of the abundant use of 
   fluorocarbon gases in aerosol spray cans, the Earth's protective 
   ozone layer is severely damaged, letting dangerous amounts of 
   ultra-violet rays reach the surface of our planet, starting with 
   high-altitude areas. The opening on-screen scrawl says that this 
   motion picture dramatizes what <U>COULD</U> happen in the near future 
   IF we continue to do nothing to stop this (A mere two years later, in 
   October of 1978, the FDA would order the phaseout of 
   &quot;non-essential&quot; uses of fluorocarbons in spray products. 
   Could this film have helped this happen? Who knows?). The film opens 
   with Steve Bruckner (Christopher George; <B><A HREF="grizzly_1976.htm">GRIZZLY</A></B> 
   - 1976; R.I.P.) leading a group of hikers on a two week trip down a 
   5,000 foot mountain, not heeding the warnings of Ranger Tucker 
   (Walter Barnes; <B><A HREF="pigs.htm">PIGS</A></B> - 1972; R.I.P.), 
   who tells Steve that there have been many reports of 
   &quot;accidents&quot; at that high altitude. The group of hikers and 
   Steve take two helicopters to the top of the mountain and we are 
   introduced to them and their quirks: Bossy and racist advertising 
   executive Paul (Lesiie Nielsen, who would become a comedy icon in <B><A HREF="airplane_1980.htm">AIRPLANE</A></B> 
   - 1980; R.I.P.); Native American tracker Santee (Michael Ansara; <B><A HREF="its_alive_1973.htm">IT'S
    ALIVE</A></B> - 1973; R.I.P.), the brunt of Paul's racist remarks; 
   former football player Roy (Paul Mantee; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Wolf Lake 1978">WOLF
    LAKE</A></B> - 1978; R.I.P.), who blew out his knee and was forced 
   to retire; cheating husband Frank (Jon Cedar; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#LittleCigars1973">LITTLE
    CIGARS</A></B> - 1973; R.I.P.) and his unforgiving wife Mandy (Susan 
   Backlinie), who are on this trip to try and save their marriage; 
   Professor MacGregor (Richard Jaeckel; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Dark1979">THE
    DARK</A></B> - 1979; R.I.P.), who is on this hike to study nature; 
   divorced mother Shirley (Ruth Roman; <B><A HREF="impulse_1974.htm">IMPULSE</A></B> 
   - 1974; R.I.P.) who has brought her inquisitive young son John (Bobby 
   Porter) for some bonding time; young couple Bob (Andrew Stevens; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#TerrorWithin">THE
    TERROR WITHIN</A></B> - 1988) and girlfriend Beth (Kathleen 
   Bracken); and TV reporter Terry Marsh (Lynda Day George; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Pieces">PIECES</A></B> 
   - 1982; who, like Stevens, is still with us at the time this review 
   was written). As soon as our group starts their hike, they see such 
   unusual sights as buzzards and eagles perching together in trees and 
   when they camp out for the first night, Santee says to Steve, 
   &quot;There's something strange in the woods and I don't know what it 
   is.&quot; Steve asks Santee to keep it between themselves for now 
   because it won't take much to panic the &quot;city folks&quot;. That 
   night, a wolf attacks Mandy, so, the following morning, Frank takes 
   her up the mountain to the nearest Ranger station to get her medical 
   attention, while the rest head down the mountain on their hike. Paul 
   keep making racial epithets of Santee's ancestry (stupidly calling 
   him &quot;kemo sabe&quot; and other Native American insults) and 
   generally making himself a pain-in-the-ass to the rest of the group 
   (even challenging Steve's role as leader). Frank and Mandy continue 
   to fight about his adultery while they head up the mountain, until 
   Mandy is attacked by a flock of buzzards and falls to her death over 
   a cliff to the boulders below (an awful optical effect), even though 
   Frank tries to save her. Frank finds a young, dirty mute female child 
   (Michelle Stacy) and when he gives her a slice of an orange, he is 
   attacked by an eagle, so he grabs the young girl and heads for the 
   nearest town (he just lost his wife, so he has a new purpose in 
   protecting this young girl, since it's apparent that her parents have 
   been killed). When the rest of the group discover that their first 
   food drop has been raided by animals, Paul blows a gasket and wants 
   to be the new boss, but the rest of them vote him down, preferring to 
   stay with Steve. Meanwhile, Ranger Tucker gets a call from the main 
   Ranger station telling him that animals are attacking people at 5,000 
   feet, so the Army is called in to evacuate the town and then the 
   hikers on the mountain. Tucker is attacked by a pack of rats in his 
   home (a very good and bloody scene that could never be shown in a PG 
   film today), but he escapes after pulling a rat off his face and 
   cutting its head off with a knife. He sends his wife to safety and 
   then heads to town to help with the evacuation, but there a 
   rabid-looking, scroungy dog that seems to follow his every move (more 
   on the dog and Tucker later). Steve and his hikers are attacked by a 
   pack of cougars that night and everyone chips-in to help one another, 
   except Paul, who looks out for himself like the selfish jerk he is. 
   Paul, once again, tries to assert his authority, only this time 
   Shirley (and her unwilling son John), Bob and Beth stupidly aligned 
   themselves with Paul (thinking it will be easier to hike 15 miles 
   uphill to the Ranger station than 30 miles downhill to the town). 
   Steve tries to tell them they are making a big mistake, but Santee 
   tells him, &quot;You can't save fools from themselves.&quot;, as the 
   rest head down the mountain with Steve. Paul shows what a bastard he 
   is to his four new recruits by violently abusing everyone (including 
   repeatedly throwing young John to the ground) and trying to rape 
   Beth. When Bob tries to intervene, Paul impales him in the stomach 
   with a homemade spear, killing him. As a raging thunderstorm hits, 
   Steve and his group find and abandoned mine for shelter, while Paul 
   and his remaining three scared-to-shit prisoners are exposed to the 
   elements. The now quite-mad Paul curses God (&quot;You see what you 
   want and you TAKE it!&quot;) and tries to rape Beth again, only this 
   time he is interrupted by a grizzly bear and decides that he is 
   strong enough to kill the mighty beast, so he charges the bear (they 
   both put each other in a bear hug, in a winking moment to the 
   audience), only for Paul to be mauled to death (How's that for 
   cursing God?). Frank and the young mute girl make it to town, only to 
   find it abandoned (except for a whole lotta rattlesnakes and that 
   pesky mangy mutt). Frank puts the young girl in an abandoned vehicle 
   for safety while he goes looking for a car that works, only to be 
   bitten by rattlesnakes and attacked by the dog, killing him while the 
   little girl watches horrified. Beth is bitten by a pack of wild dogs <A HREF="day_of_the_animals_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/day of the animals dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="207" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>when
    she, Shirley and John discover a destroyed helicopter (the dogs are 
   making a meal out of the helicopter's pilot nearby), so all three 
   lock themselves in the copter and wait for help. Steve and his group 
   find some abandoned, windowless cabins and are immediately chased by 
   another pack of dogs. They try to keep the dogs at bay in one of the 
   cabins, but Roy and the Professor are killed, while Steve, Terry and 
   Santee use a small dock as a raft and head down the rapids with two 
   angry dogs as passengers. The following morning, everyone wakes up to 
   find all the animals dead, thanks to our Government using an 
   experimental virus on them. Some people are immune to the virus, but 
   others, like Ranger Tucker fall victim to it, and the Army wants to 
   know why some people survived it, so I guess it won't be smooth 
   sailing for our survivors! Terry says, &quot;It's finally over!&quot;,
    but we all know that it won't be for them.&nbsp; Directed by William

   his own while scouting locations for a film in the Philippines, 
   doesn't give the large cast much to do (except for Leslie Nielsen, 
   who get a chance to show his acting chops), except act scared while 
   being attacked by various animals. But the attack scenes are 
   well-filmed, using actual animals, building suspense, and Nielsen 
   really does come across as a violent racist bully. The screenplay, by 
   the late William Norton (<B><A HREF="i_dismember_mama_1974b.htm">I

    OF THE JUGGLER</A></B> - 1979) and his wife Eleanor Norton, is 
   nothing but scenes of animals attacking people, but it is strangely 
   satisfying all the same, since all of the effects are old-school and 
   it is filled with great genre actors who are no longer with us. 
   That's what surprised me most: for a film made in 1976, very few of 
   the actors in it are alive today. For that fact alone, it is a great 
   time capsule for seeing all of these actors collected together in one 
   film. It also makes me realize how old I am since I originally saw 
   this in a theater. Also starring Michael Andreas, Gil Lamb and an

   that it is capably acted by Debbie Rochon (who has appeared in over 
   100 films from 1995 - 2006!) and some of the effects are absolutely 
   surreal (the dead plants growing out of the heads of the undead 
   victims is very well done). Thankfully, the film has a short running 
   time of 72 minutes, so it doesn't overstay it's welcome. It was 
   executive produced by Charles Band and J.R. Bookwalter. This was the

   (2004) -</B> Hey, I'm a fan of horror movies that take place during 
   the Western period of America, but this film would try the patience 
   of even the most open-minded viewer. Besides a few jump scares, this 
   film offers very little in the way of a coherent storyline. A group 
   of criminals pull off a bloody bank robbery (the best part of this 
   film) in Alabama after the end of the Civil War. They then head off 
   to an abandoned plantation (which seems to be surrounded by miles of 
   dead corn stalks) to hide out. Once inside the house, and after a 
   confrontation with a creepy scarecrow and a skinned animal in the 
   field, the criminals begin to act strangely, seeing dead children and 
   slaves. It all has something to do with the house's previous owner (a 
   cameo appearance by Muse Watson), who sacrificed his children and 
   slaves in order to bring his wife back to life. It's all very 
   confusing, slow and boring, with occasional CGI scares and a dabble 
   of gore. The talents of Henry Thomas, Patrick Fugit, Nicki Aycox, 
   Isaiah Washington, Mark Boone Junior and Michael Shannon are 
   completely wasted here as they do nothing more than walk around the 
   house in a trance (and getting killed) as we are given very little 
   information about their characters to really give a shit about their 
   fate. They are cold-blooded killers after all, as the opening bank 
   robbery shows, so why should we care about what happens to them? 
   Director Alex Turner, in his first full-length feature, does imbue 
   the film with loads of eerie atmosphere (a haunted well; a locked 
   door that holds secrets; footprints that turn from human into animal) 
   but atmospherics do not necessarily make a good film. The whole film 
   reminded me of a dumbed-down Western version of director William 
   Wesley's <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Scarecrows">SCARECROWS</A></B> 
   (1988), without the scares and shudders. Can someone please tell me 
   what the ending was all about? Does it have something to do with the 
   circle of life? I had high hopes for this film after reading a bunch 
   of positive reviews from the festival circuit. Don't believe

   Environmentalist Stanley (Patrick Lawlor) is taking his girlfriend 
   Dora (Audrey Lowe), her friend Hope (Kirstin Leigh) and Hope's 
   boyfriend Rudy (Brady Fischer, also this film's producer and 
   co-scripter) to a cabin in the middle of the woods to celebrate 
   Dora's birthday and to also collect some water samples (Stanley could 
   have done both things much more easier if he took her to Burger King 
   and tested the water in the bathroom!). Stanley hasn't been to the 
   cabin since he was a child, yet he doesn't seem too concerned with 
   the little stone demon statues that litter the property. While 
   Stanley and Dora are out in the woods collecting water samples and 
   documenting their finds with a video camera, jokester Rudy discovers 
   that the previously-locked door to the cabin's basement has now been 
   mysteriously unlocked, so he heads down there to take a look (yeah,

    do!). While holding his nose from the foul stench and stepping over 
   an axe on the floor that looks to have dry blood on it (yep, that's 
   something I would do!), Rudy discovers a weird box with the word 
   &quot;Gift&quot; emblazoned on it and a strange brass demon head 
   padlock, so he would do what every other conventional horror 
   character would do and brings the box upstairs. He nearly breaks the 
   demon head padlock with a screwdriver, but Hope lures him up to the 
   second floor for some sex (phew, dodged a bullet there!). While Rudy 
   and Hope are doing the nasty upstairs, the box begins to shimmy and 
   shake on the coffee table. We then discover that Stanley's uncle, the 
   owner of the cabin, is an expert on European folklore and has been 
   collecting objects for years, storing them in the basement (we also 
   discover that Dora's biggest fear is porcelain clowns! Well, they are 
   a little creepy.). Later that night, everyone celebrates Dora's 
   birthday (Her &quot;cake&quot; is a single Hostess Cupcake with a 
   candle in it! I guess the Craft Service budget was non-existant on 
   this film!) and then sit down in the living room to watch the video 
   footage Dora shot earlier in the day. Dora is mysteriously drawn to 
   the box on the coffee table and notices that the demon head padlock 
   is unlocked, so she removes it and opens the box (another rookie 
   move). Biggest. Mistake. Ever. An invisible evil force escapes from 
   the box and begins playing games with the foursome. Rudy's reflection 
   in the mirror tells hin, &quot;You are dead!&quot; Stanley's van 
   takes off by itself without any apparent driver. Rudy becomes 
   possessed (in a really crappy makeup job) and begins terrorizing 
   everyone else. Stanley is attacked by a stone demon statue and then 
   chops-up Rudy into little pieces with the basement axe (all of it 
   off-screen). Stanley, Dora and Hope (who should change her name to No 
   Hope) become trapped in the cabin when a mysterious wailing force 
   surrounds the outside of the cabin (and Dora has a nightmare where 
   she is attacked by a porcelain clown). Rudy comes back to play some 
   more deadly games with the living (I guess the dead have a special 
   supernatural glue that works with human body parts), but by the time 
   the film finally ends, you'll be rooting for Rudy to finally finish 
   off these people, who all have the charisma of a rock and the brains 
   to match. NOTE: Apparently &quot;Gift&quot; in German means 
   &quot;Poison&quot;. I looked it up and they were right.&nbsp; Oh, 
   boy. Director/co-scripter Vince Di Meglio (<B><A HREF="christmas_nightmare_2001.htm">CHRISTMAS
    NIGHTMARE</A></B> - 2001) may have been &quot;inspired&quot; by <B>EVIL
    DEAD</B>, but he's no Sam Raimi. Where much of <B>EVIL DEAD</B> 
   depended on the &quot;anything goes&quot; performance of Bruce 
   Campbell and Raimi's frenetic directorial style and camera 
   placements, <B><A HREF="deadfall_2000b.htm">DEADFALL</A></B> has the 
   dull-as-dishwater Patrick Lawlor (and later on, Kirstin Leigh) in the 
   Campbell role and while Di Meglio tries hard with his camera 
   placements and movements, by the year 2000 it had all been done to 
   death in countless other horror films. The total lack of blood and 
   gore throughout most of the film's running time certainly doesn't 
   help its cause and the stabs at comedy (a possessed Rudy getting face-planted
    with a frying pan; Stanley going after Rudy with electric hedge 
   clippers before running out of electric cord) seem more forced than 
   funny. When the &quot;tree rape&quot; scene in <B>EVIL DEAD</B> is 
   replaced here by Dora getting attacked by leaves (!), you'll say 
   enough is enough. Why parody a film that was a parody to begin with? 
   Don't waste your time with such tripe. There's also no nudity besides 
   a shot of Rudy's ass pressed against the glass shower door. Really, 
   is that what we really want to see when watching a horror film (gay 
   men excluded)? If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, <B>DEADFALL</B> 
   can be considered a swift kick to Sam Raimi's ballsack. This is such 
   a blatant rip-off of Raimi's film, but neither Di Meglio or Fischer 
   bother to thank him (or recognize his huge contribution) in the 
   closing credits. Screw them. Available on DVD from Lincoln Media

   Peaks. While Bob is at work, Wendi has the gas and electric turned on 
   in their house and the utility man makes sexual advances towards her. 
   When she turns him down, he walks outside and pisses on the house. 
   The two elderly people who live next to them are deaf and strange. 
   The old lady likes to drive her car on Bob and Wendi's lawn while 
   honking the horn and later we see the two old farts taking a shower 
   with bottled water. Someone leaves a bouquet of flowers at the front 
   door for Wendi with a welcome letter (that looks more like a ransom 
   note!), but as Wendi will find out later that night, the flowers are 
   covered in poison oak (she wakes up in bed with her face covered in 
   blisters and has<A HREF="deadly_end_2005.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/deadly end aka neighborhood watch dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="173" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   to be rushed to the hospital). Wendy begins acting strange, hiding in 
   moving boxes and not wanting to leave the house. Bob meets another 
   strange neighbor named Adrien (Nick Searcy), who covers&nbsp; his 
   windows with newspapers and spend his days and nights listening to a 
   religious radio call-in show. Adrien delivers some chocolates to Bob 
   and Wendi's house as a welcoming gift, but as they will find out, the 
   chocolates are filled with a horse laxative (Bob has a particularly 
   bad bathroom accident at work, that's both nasty and hilariously 
   funny). Adrien returns the next day with a gift of grape preserves, 
   but Bob tells him to take his preserves and get lost. Adrien then 
   threatens both Bob and Wendi's lives, calling them &quot;damn sex 
   whores&quot; and returns in the middle of the night to sabotage the 
   food in their refrigerator. Bob catches him in the act and calls the 
   police, but as Bob will soon find out, the police are just as crazy 
   as Adrien and everyone else on the block. When Bob tries to gather 
   all the neighbors together to form a neighborhood watch, he and Wendi 
   find out that no one dares speak badly about Adrien. When Bob and 
   Wendi discover that she is pregnant, the film takes a gross turn that 
   will most certainly make you laugh and wince in pain at the same 
   time.&nbsp; This sick and twisted film is like a black comedy version 
   of the 1984 thriller <B><A HREF="impulse_1984.htm">IMPULSE</A></B>, 
   where a chemical spill causes a town to lose all their inhibitions. 
   In this case, whatever was spilled (it's never explained or expanded 
   upon after Scotty's off-hand remark about it to Bob) caused the 
   people to turn totally insane and director/scripter Graeme Whifler 
   (who scripted the equally outrageous <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Sonny Boy">SONNY
    BOY</A></B> [1989] and the above-average horror comedy <B><A HREF="dr_giggles.htm">DR.
    GIGGLES</A></B> [1992]) piles on the depravity, but always with a 
   wicked sense of humor. My favorite scene is when we watch Adrien 
   &quot;masturbate&quot; in his bedroom. He inserts a finger into a 
   stitched-up incision in his stomach and repeatedly jams a hypodermic 
   needle into his crotch while moaning like some schoolboy reaching 
   orgasm. Both Jack Huston and Pell James prove to be good sports, as 
   they spend a good portion of their screen time in the bathroom, 
   either with a bad case of the &quot;Hershey squirts&quot; or puking 
   their guts out, thanks to Adrien fucking around with their food and 
   water. I don't recommend this low-budget film to new home owners, 
   because it will make you very wary of your neighbors. Everyone has a 
   neighbor they don't particularly care for, but this film amps up that 
   fear to a whole new level. While not very gory (Until the outrageous 
   finale, where Adrien performs a homemade C-section on Wendi and 
   sticks his hands into her open stomach and then performs the same 
   operation on himself, fondling his internal organs and removing a 
   large tumor, only to be interrupted by the deaf old man. What happens 
   next is truly mind-boggling!), the film makes you feel uncomfortable, 
   such as the scene where Adrien spits into an unconscious Bill's mouth 
   or when he turns off the electricity to the deaf old lady's 
   ventilator. Nick Searcy (a great character actor probably best known 
   to readers as portraying Deputy Ben Healy on the cult TV series <B><A HREF="american_gothic_tv_series.htm">AMERICAN
    GOTHIC</A></B> [1995 - 1996]) is outstanding here as an insane 
   individual who performs unnecessary operations on himself, including 
   surgically removing his own penis (he shouts out, &quot;No more dirty 
   sheets! No more stinky juice!&quot;). The ending of the film is 
   somewhat of a letdown, but I guarantee that you will be sitting there 
   with your mouth wide open, wondering if what you just witnessed 
   wasn't just some bad fever dream. This is a darkly comic trip into a 
   perverse sector of Twilight Zone, which should come as no surprise 
   once you discover that Graeme Whifler started his career directing 
   music videos for such eclectic bands as The Residents and Oingo 
   Boingo. Originally filmed under the title <B><A HREF="neighborhood_watch_2005.htm">NEIGHBORHOOD
    WATCH</A></B> which is a much more fitting title if you ask me. Also

   (which is film-speak for &quot;We didn't care for the film.&quot;) 
   and, as of this writing, has yet to achieve a legitimate U.S. home

    out of the way first: There's plenty of sub-par acting, enough plot 
   holes to start a swiss cheese factory and some really crappy 
   (although quick) CGI shots of the monsters, in this case giant 
   scorpions. All is not lost here, though, because there are some 
   really good and gory makeup effects and the majority of the giant 
   scorpion effects are practical. The story is simple (screenplay by C. 
   Courtney Joyner [<B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Lurking Fear">LURKING
    FEAR</A></B> - 1994] as &quot;Gene Yarbrough&quot; and Bookwalter as 
   &quot;Lance Randas&quot;): Some unscrupulous land developers allow 
   toxic waste to be dumped on their desert property. Normal-size 
   scorpions frolic in the toxic substance and turn into six foot 
   killing machines (their POV shots make them see like flies), tearing 
   apart the population of a small town, beginning with high school 
   wrestler Eric (Jeff Dylan Graham), who gets his insides ripped-out by 
   one of the sharp-clawed buggers just as he is about to rape Joey 
   (Sarah Megan White), the sister of Alice (Marcella Laasch), a doctor 
   who runs Fairview House, a halfway house full of ex-cons and 
   recovering junkies. Mayor Carl Baxter (Jay Richardson; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Tomb Werewolf">TOMB
    OF THE WEREWOLF</A></B> - 2003), who hates the halfway house, blames 
   the residents of said abode for the disappearance of some of the 
   town's residents and the murder of Eric. Besides Alice and Joey, 
   other members of the halfway house includes Jim Crane (Nicolas Read; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Slaughter Studios">SLAUGHTER
    STUDIOS</A></B> - 2002), who may or may not be responsible for the 
   murder of his wife, and crankhead Elroy (Trent Haaga; <B><A HREF="#Ghouls 2003">THE
    GHOULS</A></B> - 2003), who sees imaginary demons due to his 
   excessive past drug abuse (or is he pulling a fast one on Alice?). 
   Mayor Baxter pressures Sheriff Evans (Stephen O'Mahoney) to arrest 
   Jim for Eric's murder, but when the mayor gets killed by one of the 
   snapping critters and county coroner Collins (Sewell Whitney, who 
   pukes at the sight of dead bodies) narrowly escapes a scorpion 
   attack, Collins and the residents of Fairway House must defend 
   themselves as the scorpions lay siege to the building once the 
   Sheriff is butchered by a scorpion. How do you kill mutant scorpions? 
   Why, you find a way to use their deadly tail venom against them, 
   that's how!&nbsp; While not a badly-made film, <B><A HREF="deadly_stingers_2003b.htm">DEADLY
    STINGERS</A></B> has so many lapses in common logic that it becomes 
   painful at times to watch. Why in the world would Jim be serving time 
   in a halfway house in the same town where he supposedly killed his 
   wife? If he didn't kill his wife, wouldn't it give the real killer 
   just more opportunities to make Jim look guilty? How in the hell did 
   Elroy get his hands on a gun when he's not allowed to leave the 
   halfway house? How come the rest of the town isn't panicking? If you 
   can get past these huge plot holes, some of the intentionally funny 
   dialogue (much of it not funny at all) and the lousy CGI (which is 
   usually just shots of multiple scorpions in the same frame), you may 
   enjoy some of the bloody gore on view and the practical rubbery giant 
   scorpion mock-ups (Trent Haaga, who is the best actor in the film, 
   has the most memorable death. A scorpion rips-off both his legs and 
   he tells the rest of the cast, &quot;It looks a lot worse than it 
   actually is&quot; before dying). In some ways, this film is a 
   throwback to all those giant creature feature films of the 50's, but 
   then modern technology once again raises its ugly head to remind us 
   otherwise. Look for blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameos by Brinke 
   Stevens, Ariauna Albright and Debbie Rochon. Also starring Lilith 
   Stabs (seriously?) Jeffrey Sisson and Sunny Leone. The print I viewed 
   was a DVD-R taken from a British cable telecast. No U.S. label 
   available at the time of this review, although it would make perfect 
   SyFy fodder. <B>Not Rated</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

   until her skull bloodily splits open). Instead of wondering what 
   happened to Sam and the realtor, Matthew and his girlfriend JJ (Robin

   plays one of the dusty slot machines (that, surprisingly, still 
   works!) and it pays out in human teeth. Skeeter takes a crap in a 
   toilet that overflows with blood. Emily meets a blackjack dealer 
   (Rico Simonini), one of the ghosts of the massacre forty years 
   earlier, who challenges her to a game of blackjack (Emily is not only 
   a lesbo, she's a math genius, to boot!). Skeeter meets another 
   murdered ghost, Melissa (Jessica Morris; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BloodyMurder">BLOODY
    MURDER</A></B> - 1999), and suddenly there's some spring to his

   Roy Donahue and Gil Wachetta (Michael Berryman; <B><A HREF="hills_have_eyes_1977.htm">THE

   Franco hid two million dollars in silver in the casino and they want 
   it (What in the hell are ghosts gonna do with a fortune in silver? 
   They're fucking ghosts for Christ's sake!). Everyone becomes trapped 
   in the casino (Suddenly, cellphone service stops, because, as we all 
   know, supernatural forces can block the cellphones' service 
   providers. Give me a fucking break!), as Roy, Gil and the other 
   ghosts begin dispatching Matthew's friends in various, 
   cost-conscious, low-budget ways, all having to do with games of 
   chance. In the finale, Matthew must play Roy one hand of Poker, the 
   winner getting both the silver and a chance to escape with their 
   lives.&nbsp; This has all the earmarks of a latter-day Charles Band 
   flick: It's filmed on limited sets; has more talk than action; has 
   most of the females in skimpy clothing, but stops short of actual 
   nudity; and has special effects that are a combination of cheap CGI 
   and even cheaper practical effects (The Melissa demon, who has 
   one-armed bandit slots instead of eyes, elicits laughter rather than 
   fear, as does the roulette wheel demon, who looks like a <B><A HREF="ghoulies_1985.htm">GHOULIES</A></B>

    HEADS</A></B> - 2009), is just a collection of stereotypical 
   characters and clich&eacute;d situations, many of which don't make 
   any sense at all. The only line of dialogue that made me laugh was 
   when Skeeter says to Melissa, &quot;Popping a boner over a dead 
   chick? I gotta have my head examined!&quot; Michael Berryman is 
   totally wasted here, relegated to saying &quot;Good one, boss!&quot;

   Newbury are very popular and have huge turnouts. Nora soon finds out

   necrophiliacs and when they feel the urge they run some young girl

   Squad, who go around shooting all the zombies that they see. There's 
   also the Reverend Jones (Robert Kokai) who plans on using the zombies 
   for his own nefarious means. The story is inconsequential, as scenes 
   of zombies biting into their victims or Zombie Squad members killing 
   the zombies are shown very frequently (the film only runs about 70 
   minutes if you don't count the long end credits sequence). Flesh and 
   guts are ripped apart, heads are severed or blown off and other body 
   appendages are chewed or torn off. The effects are quite good (by

   Sleeper of a film that never quite got the recognition it deserved, 
   thanks to it's generic title (at least ten films share it) and lack 
   of publicity or distribution.&nbsp; Serial killer Leo Rook

   prison ship headed for an isolated prison island and sets foot on a 
   island with a lighthouse (<B><A HREF="lighthouse_1999.htm">LIGHTHOUSE</A></B> 
   is the film's original title). After killing most of the lighthouse 
   residents, Rook turns off the light in the lighthouse causing the 
   prison ship to crash on the jagged rocks. The surviving prisoners and 
   guards, including new prison doctor Kirsty McCloud (Rachel Shelley), 
   must learn to trust each other while Rook begins killing them in very 
   gory ways. Dr. McCloud forms an uneasy alliance with prisoner Richard 
   Spader (James Purefoy), who says he is innocent. Is he really? What 
   secret is Dr. McCloud concealing? And what are Rook's motives for 
   causing this shipwreck? While this might seem a generic description 
   for hundreds of slasher films, <B><A HREF="dead_of_night_1999b.htm">DEAD
    OF NIGHT</A></B> delivers where it counts. It's scary, involving and 
   gory as all hell. I'm quite surprised that this actually received an 
   R-rating in the States as there are many scenes of dismemberment 
   (Rook really likes to decapitate people) and tense scenes of terror 
   (try to watch the scene with the rolling aerosol can in the bathroom 
   and not jump out of your skin). First time director Simon Hunter (<B><A HREF="mutant_chronicles_2007.htm">THE
    MUTANT CHRONICLES</A></B> - 2007) gives the whole film a genuinely 
   creepy atmosphere, filming the kills in unusual ways (one kill can 
   only be seen in a swinging window's reflection) and using fog, light 
   and sound to great effect. The final 15 minutes are a spectacular 
   white knuckle ride, so the less said about it the better. This is one 
   film that should be on every slasher film fanatic's must-see list. 
   What are you waiting for? This film reminded me of 1972's <B><A HREF="tower_of_evil_1972.htm">TOWER

   in the early-90's that everyone was clamoring to get their hands on 
   the <A HREF="dead_pit_1989_imperial_vhs.htm">Imperial Entertainment VHS</A> 
   of this title because of the raised plastic cover (Imperial also 
   released <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Black Roses">BLACK ROSES</A></B> 
   [1988] in a raised plastic cover), where you pressed the creature's 
   finger and its eyes would light up with a green color (Imperial also 
   released a flat slipcase version, which was much easier to find). It 
   took me a good couple of years to finally purchase the film in that 
   raised plastic cover (pardon the look of the scan because it is 
   nearly impossible to scan a raised cover clearly) and the eyes still 
   lit up until about 2007 (now that's long battery life!), but I was 
   kind of disappointed in the film, because to my eyes, it looked 
   severely edited to achieve an R-Rating. A few years back, Code Red 
   released a widescreen <A HREF="dead_pit_1989_dvd.htm">Unrated 
   Director's Cut double-disc DVD</A> of this film, adding over nine 
   minutes of footage to the 92-minute R-Rated version (much of it the 
   missing blood and gore), and the difference in watching the two 
   versions is like night and day. The film no longer has a disjointed 
   feel to it<A HREF="dead_pit_1989_imperial_vhs.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dead pit vhs front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   and the story, while still the same, makes more sense. The film opens 
   at a mental health facility, where Dr. Gerald Swan (the late Jeremy 
   Slate; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Born Losers">BORN LOSERS</A></B> 
   - 1967) disagrees with the ways Dr. Colin Ramzi (Danny Gochnauer) is 
   treating his patients. We then watch Dr. Ramzi giving one of his male 
   patients a lobotomy by sticking a metal probe through the base of his 
   eye and carrying him to an abandoned wing of the facility that is 
   located in the basement under the clock tower. Dr. Swan discovers the 
   still-living body of the patient lying on a table in the basement, 
   his brain exposed with wires pulled tight to keep the skin separated, 
   while formaldehyde is being pumped into his brain and arteries. Dr. 
   Ramzi suddenly appears and tries to give Dr. Swan one of his patented 
   lobotomies, but Dr. Swan pulls out a pistol and shoots Dr. Ramzi 
   right in the middle of his forehead, killing him instantly. Dr. Swan 
   then puts his foe's dead body in a basement room and seals the door 
   with cement so the room cannot be discovered. Twenty years pass and 
   Dr. Swan is still the head of the facility. A new patient, who they 
   dub &quot;Jane Doe&quot; (Cheryl Lawson; <B><A HREF="vineyard_1989.htm">THE
    VINEYARD</A></B> - 1989) because she can't remember her name or 
   anything about her life, is admitted for her severe amnesia. Jane 
   protests, screaming that she doesn't have amnesia because her 
   &quot;memories were taken from me!&quot; As soon as she speaks those 
   words, an earthquake suddenly happens, and the basement door that had 
   held the dead body of Dr. Ramzi for twenty years bursts open. Jane 
   then says, &quot;The people in the cellar need help!&quot; Dr. Swan 
   immediately knows what she is talking about, but even he will not be 
   prepared for what is to come. Dr. Ramzi returns to life (or a 
   facsimile of it), only now he has red glowing eyes and the bullet 
   hole is still in the middle of his forehead. He begins to 
   systematically kill staff and patients alike, usually by giving them 
   eye lobotomies first (there is a lot of gory eye violence in this 
   film) and then bringing them to the basement under the clock tower 
   (which is now known as the &quot;Dead Pit&quot; because he disposes 
   his victims' bodies in a pit in the floor). Somehow, Jane is involved 
   in this mess (Dr. Swan hypnotizes her and finds out her name is Sara, 
   but I'll keep calling her Jane in this review), as Dr. Ramzi taunts 
   her relentlessly, first by throwing the decapitated head of the Head 
   Orderly (Get it?) at her. Jane also has nightmares about Dr. Ramzi, 
   whom she is sure is the one who stole her memories. Dr. Swan believes 
   her, but Head Nurse Kygar (Joan Bechtel) treats her like a crazy 
   loon. Jane finally realizes that her nightmares about Dr. Ramzi and 
   flashes of her childhood are true, so she asks fellow patient Chris 
   (Stephen Gregory Foster) to help her escape the facility. Chris 
   manages to pry an outside door open and Jane escapes, but Chris is 
   caught and thrown in a rubber room (the guards don't notice Jane 
   running away). Jane hides in the abandoned clock tower until she 
   figures out a way to get through the facility's high fences, but 
   since that area is Dr. Ramzi's base of operations, she has to try to 
   keep one step ahead of him when she discovers the mutilated corpses 
   of his victims in the Dead Pit. Alas, Jane is caught by Dr. Ramzi and 
   is knocked out. When she wakes up, she finds herself strapped to a 
   table with Dr. Ramzi ready to perform his experiments on her. Jane 
   sees all of Dr. Ramzi's victims, both past and present, rise from the 
   Dead Pit as zombies. They begin laying siege to the facility, first 
   making a meal of two security guards outside after ripping them apart 
   (one zombie holds a freshly removed liver of one of the guards in 
   front of the camera). Chris escapes from the rubber room during the 
   mass slaughter (We see a bunch of zombies sitting at a table, eating 
   the brains of some of their victims, like it is some formal dinner 
   party!) and saves Jane, but they can't find a working car because the 
   zombies have removed the distributor cap from all of them (Chris says 
   something funny about the intellect of the zombies during this 
   sequence). Dr. Swan hides and watches horrified as the zombies (all 
   of them are literally drenched in blood) chow-down on his staff and 
   patients and he is soon joined by Jane and Chris, where Dr. Swan 
   tells them what he did to Dr. Ramzi twenty years earlier. Dr. Swan 
   heads out on his own to destroy Dr. Ramzi, but soon finds himself 
   strapped to the evil doctor's table, his brain exposed with Dr. Ramzi 
   picking at it with needles (Picking his brain. Get the joke?). It's 
   not long before Dr. Swan ends up dead. Meanwhile, Jane and Chris 
   watch as crazy mental patient Sister Clair (Geha Getz) dissolves a 
   zombie by throwing holy water on it. Chris get an idea of ending this 
   whole horrible mess: He will have Sister Clair bless the large water 
   tower on the premises and then Chris will collapse the water tower 
   with a homemade bomb, flooding the facility, including Dr. Ramzi's 
   Dead Pit, thereby dissolving Dr. Ramzi and his horde of zombies. But 
   can they pull it off? Jane suddenly <A HREF="dead_pit_1989_dvd.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dead pit dvd front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="191" HEIGHT="269" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>remembers
    her long-suppressed childhood memories, realizing that Dr. Ramzi is 
   actually her father (&quot;Come to Daddy!&quot;). The film ends just 
   the way most 80's horror flicks end: Just when you think the evil is 
   destroyed, it is revealed that the evil actually survived, leaving 
   the film wide-open for a sequel (which never happened with this 
   film).&nbsp; This is the first film by director Brett Leonard (he 
   co-wrote the film with producer Gimel Everett). Based on the home 
   video success of this film, Brett Leonard was given directorial 
   reigns on several big-budget Hollywood films, including <B><A HREF="lawnmower_man_1992.htm">THE
    LAWNMOWER MAN</A></B> (1992), starring Pierce Brosnan; <B><A HREF="hideaway_1995.htm">HIDEAWAY</A></B> 
   (1995), starring Jeff Goldblum; and <B><A HREF="virtuosity_1995.htm">VIRTUOSITY</A></B> 
   (1995), starring Denzel Washington and one of the first U.S. films 
   for Russell Crowe. Each of those three films dealt with cyber-reality 
   in one form or another, but Leonard's film career stalled for almost 
   ten years (he became a well-respected director of music videos, 
   especially the groundbreaking ones by Peter Gabriel, and the 
   long-running 3-D IMAX Short &quot;T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous&quot; 
   [1998]). Leonard wouldn't return to films until 2004, when he made 
   the low-budget Marvel film <B><A HREF="man_thing_2004.htm">MAN-THING</A></B> 
   (which gets a lot of bad press, but I quite enjoyed it), then the 
   really disgusting cyber-thriller <B><A HREF="feed_2005.htm">FEED</A></B> 
   (2005; if you have never seen this one, be prepared and have a barf 
   bag handy), and then the really lousy <B><A HREF="highlander_the_source_2007.htm">HIGHLANDER:
    THE SOURCE</A></B> (2007). While <B><A HREF="dead_pit_1989.htm">THE 
   DEAD PIT</A></B> is really nothing special, there is a sense of humor 
   and symbolism everywhere, as Leonard seems to be winking at the 
   audience in several scenes (such as a POV shot where the camera looks 
   like it is being shown through a large keyhole, only to discover that 
   it is the shape of cutouts on the walls in the clock tower). The 
   blood flows rather freely in the Director's Cut, as we see one victim 
   with a hemostat impaled in his eye, various body parts and internal 
   organs ripped off bodies and eaten and Dr. Ramzi suffering a 
   particularly juicy demise in the finale. We also get the old standby 
   of a lighter not working trying to light the fuse to a bomb, while 
   zombies are rapidly approaching. While the film is really nothing but 
   zombie nonsense, it is enjoyable zombie nonsense with great makeup 
   effects and is a good addition to your horror library. The Code Red 
   DVD is long OOP (it was the ninth Code Red DVD, released in 2008), so 
   you may have to shell out a large amount of moola to purchase it, but 
   Jeremy Slate gives a running commentary during the film (along with 
   Leonard and Everett) and he also has an on-screen interview as one of 
   the double-disc's extras, just months before he passed away in 2006 
   (There's a nice, short tribute to him before the film plays). If you 
   can find it for an affordable price, grab it (Sometimes, Code Red 
   sells excess stock at their <A HREF="http://codereddvd.bigcartel.com">STORE</A>,
    so check there before you buy it elsewhere.). Also starring Mara 
   Everett, Jack Sunseri, Frederick Dodge, Netti Heffner, Luana

    SNOW</A><A NAME="DeadSnow2009"></A> (2009) -</B> After hearing and 
   reading good things about this Norwegian horror film about Nazi 
   zombies on the loose in the snow covered mountains, I must admit that 
   maybe my expectations were set too high, because after watching it, I 
   found it to be nothing more than an average horror flick with some 
   great location photography and some good gore and makeup effects. 
   Storywise, it's the same old scenario that has been used in hundreds 
   of horror films since <B><A HREF="friday_the_13th_1980.htm">FRIDAY

   is a horror film nerd). Seven twenty-somethings take a weekend party 
   vacation to a cabin in the mountains that is only accessible by 
   snowmobile or a 45-minute walk. They get drunk, have sex and play 
   Twister (Why? Because they saw it in a horror movie!), until a lone 
   wanderer (Bjorn Sundquist) comes knocking at their door and warns 
   them that the area they are in was once the location of a Nazi 
   atrocity during World War II, where hundreds of people were 
   mysteriously slaughtered. Up to this day, people still go missing, 
   which worries Vegard (Lasse Valdal), since hi<A HREF="dead_snow_2009.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dead snow dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="231" HEIGHT="318" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>s
    girlfriend Sara (Ane Dahl Torp) decided to ski to the cabin instead 
   of joining everyone else on the car/snowmobile trip and she hasn't 
   arrived yet (What Vegard and the group doesn't know, but the audience 
   does, is that Sara is already dead, as we watch her being murdered by 
   persons unknown in the film's opening minutes). The wanderer should 
   have listened to his own advice and left the area, because later that 
   night he has his throat cut and is then torn to pieces in his tent by 
   an unseen growling figure. When Sara doesn't show up at the cabin, 
   Vegard takes the only snowmobile to look for her, while the rest of 
   the gang amuse themselves with sled races and heavy drinking. Erlend 
   (Jeppe Beck Laursen), the horror film nerd (he walks around in a <B><A HREF="braindead_1992c.htm">BRAINDEAD</A></B> 
   [1992] tee shirt), discovers a small chest full of old gold jewelry, 
   while Vegard discovers the disemboweled remains of the wanderer and 
   then falls through a hole in the snow. Chris (Jenny Skavlan) becomes 
   the first casualty of the group (second, if you count Sara) when she 
   is attacked and killed in the outhouse and then Erlend becomes the 
   next victim when a zombie rips his face apart at his eye sockets. It 
   then becomes survival of the fittest, as the rest of the group tries 
   to make it to safety or stay put in the cabin, while an army of Nazi 
   zombies descends upon them. Using whatever weapons they can find 
   (including a sledgehammer, a chainsaw, a WWII-era German hand grenade 
   and tree branches), the group tries to fend off the zombies (most are 
   unsuccessful), while Vegard (who was bitten by a zombie) makes an 
   important discovery in a cave and races back to his friends (his 
   snowmobile is now equipped with a mounted machine gun!). The 
   resulting bloodbath is guaranteed to please even the most jaded of 
   gorehounds, but disappoint those who were hoping for a more 
   fleshed-out story.&nbsp; Besides taking nearly forty minutes to get 
   to the first kill in the group, director Tommy Wirkola (<B><A HREF="kill_buljo_2007.htm">KILL
    BULJO: THE MOVIE</A></B> - 2007), who also co-wrote the screenplay 
   with Stig Frode Henriksen (who co-stars as Roy), throws-in every 
   horror film clich&eacute; in the book, including false jump scares, 
   jokey film reference dialogue (God, I hate that crap! Curse you, <B><A HREF="scream_1997.htm">SCREAM</A></B>!
    [1997]) and unbelievable situations (The major offender being Chris 
   entering the outhouse while Erlend is taking a shit and then making 
   love to him. Yech!). Thankfully, the nice snowy scenery (which, even 
   on the hottest summer day, will cool you down just by looking at it) 
   and gory makeup effects redeem the film to a certain degree, offering 
   some novel and imaginative sights (My favorite being Vegard hanging 
   off the side of a cliff using a zombie's intestines as a rope, while 
   another zombie tries to bite him. Vegard's death is also memorable.). 
   Watching Nazi zombies rising and running through the snow is also a 
   creepy sight (the finale is particularly effective), but I could have 
   done without all the semi-humorous &quot;ain't it cool&quot; dialogue 
   and some particularly noticeable CGI effects and just stuck with the 
   straight-ahead horror aspects of the film. That's where <B><A HREF="dead_snow_2009b.htm">DEAD
    SNOW</A></B> (original title: <B><A HREF="dod_sno_2009.htm">DOD SNO</A></B>)

   I've had this DVD in my &quot;To Be Watched&quot; pile for over three 
   years because, frankly, this film couldn't possibly live up to it's 
   hype. Lost for over 25 years (Well, not exactly lost. Just mostly 
   unseen except for a small cult following since it was pirated on VHS 
   in 1983), <B>DEATH BED</B> has slowly built word-of-mouth raves that 
   I have read on various websites and publications. That has always 
   bothered me since <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Malatesta">MALATESTA'S
    CARNIVAL OF BLOOD</A></B> (1973) got the same type of press and I

    Well, I'm glad to report that <B><A HREF="death_bed_1977b.htm">DEATH BED</A></B> 
   is a laugh riot and not in some unintentional way. This is a 
   deliberate horror comedy that hits all the right notes. The film is 
   broken into chapters, titled &quot;Breakfast&quot;, &quot;Lunch&quot; 
   and &quot;Dinner&quot; and each chapter tells a different story about 
   separate victims of the bed, which our imprisoned narrator (who was a 
   victim of the bed) mocks continually, especially for it's 
   &quot;stupidity&quot; for not being able to move. The bed is located 
   in an abandoned castle, it's always-clean white sheets and purple 
   canopy inviting people to come and try it out. Little do they know 
   that the bed is hungry and will devour their flesh (not to mention 
   their bucket of chicken, apples or whatever else they bring to bed 
   with them) with it's acidic juices, sometimes only leaving bone in 
   it's wake. Our narrator sits helplessly behind a painting facing the 
   bed, witnessing the murdering mattress from Hell doing it's business. 
   The film is just a series of funny (and sometimes frightening) 
   imaginative kills, enhanced by the bed's absurd sound effects, some 
   creative (and downright hilarious) visuals and our narrator's 
   continuous verbal attacks addressed to the bed. 
   Director/producer/writer George Barry, who started this film in 1972 
   but didn't strike an answer print until 1977, never made another film 
   after this, thanks to it never getting a legal distribution deal in 
   the U.S.. It's a shame, too, because Barry had talent. Though not 
   overly bloody (gorehounds will be disappointed), Barry does splash 
   the red stuff around, though much of it (but not all) is used for 
   comical effect. By the end of the film, you will think the bed is a 
   real character because, between the crazy visuals and the narrator's 
   verbal and visual history of the bed, it seems to take a life and 
   personality all it's own.&nbsp; That's one of the hardest things to 
   do as a filmmaker and Barry hits it out of the ballpark on his first 
   try. Since he is still alive, maybe someone will give George Barry 
   the funds to make another film. If the actor who loses his hands at 
   the end of the film looks familiar, that because the credited actor 
   &quot;Rusty Russ&quot; is actually the excellent character actor 
   William Russ, who you have seen in films like <B><A HREF="unholy_1988.htm">THE
    UNHOLY</A></B> (1988) and <B><A HREF="american_history_x_1998.htm">AMERICAN
    HISTORY X</A></B> (1998) and has appeared on too many TV shows to 
   mention. This was his first acting role in a film. After watching <B><A HREF="death_bed_the_bed_that_eats_1972-1977_blu-ray.htm">DEATH
    BED</A></B>, one has to wonder how many other undiscovered gems are

   rotting away, never getting their chance in the spotlight like this

   Linda Bond, Patrick Spence-Thomas and Dave Marsh. A Cult Epics DVD 
   &amp; Blu-Ray Release. <B>Not Rated</B>. Contains female nudity, Russ 
   with skeleton hands and a lengthy scene of a Black girl trying to

   This lightweight, made in Staten Island, NY, horror film is just 
   slightly above the quality of the films of Staten Island's own Andy 
   Milligan, but just slightly. It is a talky flick that opens up in a 
   Dutch Village in the 1700's, where a woman named Lise (Shelby 
   Leverington) is accused of being a Southern Tribes witch by town 
   leader Peter Vroot (Aaron Phillips). We really never see what happens 
   to her, but she puts a curse on the Vroot family, telling Peter that 
   in 300 years, his ancestors will suffer her wrath. We then cut to 
   1971, where ancestor Peter Vroot (Phillips again) is having dinner 
   with his wife Naomi (Sarnell Ogus), daughters Sarah (Sylvia 
   Pressler), Coral (Rhonda Russell) and young-un Elly (Leslie Knight), 
   sons Roger (Denver John Collins) and Michael (Bruce Brentliner) and 
   Coral's fiance Jake (Norman Paige). Family friend Lise (Leverington 
   again) shows up late for dinner, but seems like a good companion to 
   Naomi and her daughters<A HREF="death_by_invitation_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/death by invitation poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="182" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   Sarah and Elly. Little do the Vroot family know that the 300 years 
   are up and Lise is about to exact revenge. Lise first lures the 
   virginal Roger to her home, which is full of black candles and other 
   witchcraft-related items. She takes Roger's shirt off and puts her 
   hands on Roger's shoulders as the camera pans down and we see blood 
   running down Roger's back. When Roger doesn't come home, Peter calls 
   the police and the detective (Tom Mahoney) accuses Roger of selling 
   or using drugs, implying to Peter that his son is probably passed out 
   in a gutter somewhere after getting high. The rich Peter doesn't 
   believe his ears and forces the detective to leave his house. The 
   rich Peter offers Jake a job and wants him to come to his office to 
   talk about it (There's a head-scratching long sequence where Jake 
   arrives Peter's office building, only to discover that you need a map 
   to find his office. Once he is in Peter's office, the music playing 
   on the intercom increases, making the conversation between Jake and 
   Peter hard to make out. This sequence serves no purpose except to pad 
   out the film's paltry 81 minutes). At another dinner at the Vroot 
   house, Lise goes to talk to Sarah in her bedroom, only for Lise to 
   tear Sarah's head off (off-screen). When little Elly goes to check up 
   on them, she opens Sarah's door and sees Lise holding Sarah's 
   decapitated head. Elly screams, falls down the stairs and hits her 
   head on a chair, killing her. The Vroot family is destroyed, but Lise 
   isn't done with them yet. The only problem is, Jake knows something 
   is up with her, so he comes on to Lise and gets himself invited to 
   her house for a makeout session. Jake doesn't know that both young 
   Michael and Peter follow him (Peter is more concerned about Jake 
   cheating on Coral!). Once at the house, Lise tries to seduce Jake, 
   but he is having nothing of it. Michael sneaks into a room covered by 
   a heavy curtain and discovers blood on the floor. When Jake sees 
   Michael's pale face as he exits the room, he goes to investigate and 
   discovers the chopped-up remains of Roger hanging in a plastic bag, 
   his blood dripping on the floor. Peter grabs an axe and tries to kill 
   Lise, only to have the axe slice Peter's throat (at least that's what 
   I think happened, because it is filmed in a way that we never see the 
   action performed clearly). Peter dies and the curse is lifted. Well, 
   I think it is because the film suddenly ends.&nbsp; Although there 
   are a few sparse scenes of bloody gore (especially the scene of Lise 
   holding Sarah's decapitated head), the film is badly acted (most of 
   the people who starred in this, except for Shelby Leverington, never 
   appeared in another film), they step on each other's lines and it 
   moves at a snail's pace. Director/writer Ken Friedman only directed 
   one other film, the 1987 road drama <B><A HREF="made_in_usa_1987.htm">MADE

   the film's more unintentional humorous moments, the detective's 
   police sidekick, Sam (Jay Lanno), has no idea where to walk once he 
   delivers his lines. He walks directly into the detective and then 
   looks straight into the camera as if to ask the director where he 
   should go! There's not much to recommend here except some wild 
   70's-styled flowered and striped shirts (worn by the male cast!), 
   long sideburns and fleeting glimpses of nudity. Executive Producer

   throughout the 70's about an ancient Seminole Indian witch doctor out 
   to get revenge on those who desecrate his sacred burial ground. The 
   film opens with an explorer (an uncredited Brad F. Grinter; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Blood Freak">BLOOD
    FREAK</A></B> - 1972) discovering a secret cave in the Florida 
   Everglades, which contains the sarcophagus of Tartu (played by makeup 
   effects technician and magician Doug Hobart). The huge stone door 
   (which is obviously made of Styrofoam) closes behind him, trapping 
   the explorer as Tartu rises from his coffin, kills the explorer and 
   opens a manuscript in the explorer's possession, the pages revealed 
   to be the opening credits of the film (which Tartu slowly flips 
   through for the viewers'<A HREF="death_curse_of_tartu_1966.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/death curse of tartu vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="195" HEIGHT="320" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   pleasure)! We then switch to Indian guide Billy (Bill Marcus) and 
   explorer Sam Gunter (Frank Weed) paddling a canoe through the 
   Everglades until they reach a destination on Sam's map. Billy refuses 
   to go any further (&quot;Ever since I was a young boy, I've seen my 
   people bring back the bodies of dead men who have invaded this sacred 
   burial ground.&quot;), so Sam heads out on his own (&quot;Any ghost 
   that bothers me will have his hands full!) after handing Billy the 
   map and telling him to give it to Ed Tison (Fred Pinero) and his wife 
   Julie (Babette Sherrill) so they can come here in airboats. Sam 
   continues his trek, ignoring ancient warnings like human skulls 
   hanging on tree branches and then setting up camp. After doing a 
   little exploring, Sam discovers an ancient Seminole artifact buried 
   under an alligator skull, which wakes up Tartu once again. Tartu 
   transforms into a huge boa constrictor and crushes Sam to death while 
   Indian drums and warrior chanting fills the air. Bill gives Ed and 
   Julie the map, but refuses to go with them, so they, along with 
   archaeology students Cindy (Mayra Cristine), Johnny (Sherman Hayes), 
   Tommy (Gary Holtz) and Joann (Maurice Stewart), take the airboats to 
   their destination and look for Sam. When they find the camp, but no 
   Sam, Ed tells the students that he must be out hunting a deer, but he 
   knows something is wrong. Ed begins deciphering the artifact Sam left 
   behind (It tells how witch doctor Tartu can take the shape of any 
   creature to exact revenge and that only nature can destroy him), 
   while the students go to the lake to &quot;roast marshmallows&quot; 
   (a code phrase for making out and doing the Twist in their bathing 
   suits). Apparently, Tartu doesn't appreciate cheap 60's rock-and-roll 
   or woman shaking their asses, as he turns into a shark and devours 
   Tommy and Joann as they take a swim, an occurrence Ed finds 
   impossible (&quot;Sharks don't live in fresh water.&quot;). The drums 
   and warrior chants fill the air once again, so Ed, Julie, Cindy and 
   Johnny beat a hasty retreat to the airboats, only to discover that 
   they have been destroyed by alligators. Johnny leaves to find help on 
   his own, but is soon repeatedly bitten in the face by a poisonous 
   snake and dies. Ed decides that the only way to stop this madness is 
   to find Tartu's grave and destroy his body, but Cindy panics and is 
   killed by an alligator. When Tartu transforms into a young version of 
   himself and chases Julie into a pit of quicksand (caves, quicksand, 
   sharks...man, the Everglades have everything!), Ed has to find a way 
   to save her and destroy Tartu at the same time. Hmmmm...maybe if you 
   could find a way to toss him in the quicksand!&nbsp; Ah, memories. 
   What scared me as a young 'un now seems awfully quaint and cheap, but 
   not without its charms. There's some nice on-location Everglades 
   photography and some surprisingly gory effects on-view (including Ed 
   dragging the lake and latching-on to one of Tommy's dismembered arms 
   and Cindy having her hand bitten off by an alligator) and the acting 
   could be a whole lot worse than it is. Unfortunately, the pacing of 
   the film is deadly slow and director/screenwriter William Grefe does 
   no one any favors by inserting long scenes of people running or 
   walking through the Everglades, a silly &quot;dancing by the 
   lake&quot; sequence or the unbelievable bit where Ed moves the giant 
   stone door by using the powder of a single rifle bullet! Still, the 
   sight of the skeletal Tartu rising from his coffin is very effective 
   (and has been burned in my brain since I was a child) and there's 
   some choice 60's gore on view (man, 60's blood was really bright 
   red!), so <B><A HREF="death_curse_of_tartu_sting_of_death_dvd.htm">DEATH

   which led to the prison being closed down permanently. No one knows

    (a flashback reveals that Elias may have been the catalyst, but he 
   talks about himself in the third person and the kids don't make the 
   connection), where he had to cut off both of his legs off at the 
   knees in order to survive (he hid in the prison's gas chamber while 
   everything burned around him), our trio (with two additional friends) 
   head to the abandoned prison to begin filming. Unfortunately, they 
   are not alone in the prison, as six fugitives of a diamond heist, led 
   by Marco (Jake Busey; <B><A HREF="frighteners_1996.htm">THE FRIGHTENERS</A></B> 
   - 1996), use the prison as a hideout (the irony of the situation is 
   not lost on the crooks). One of the fugitives, Vincent (James Leo 
   Ryan), has a serious leg injury and when his blood drips on the 
   prison floor, it wakes up vengeful spirits who died there (they move 
   in herky-jerky motions) and they begin killing the living in various 
   gory ways. Marco has a history with this prison, since his 
   grandfather (a badly made-up Busey; they should have spent a few 
   bucks more and used his crazy father Gary Busey!) was a guard there 
   and then became a prisoner (the grandfather and Elias had a history) 
   before he died in the bloody riot. The rest of the film is nothing 
   but a series of gory set-pieces, as the prison's pissed-off- spirits 
   begin murdering the living while the prison becomes inescapable. 
   Fugitive Ron (Marco Rodriguez) is squeezed through a chain link 
   fence, turning his body into bloody puree. Anibal (Russell 
   Richardson) gets sliced into little pieces when his body is forced 
   through a license plate cutting machine. Hector (Rey Gellegos) is 
   fried on the electric chair (Is it standard for a prison to have both 
   a gas chamber and an electric chair? Oops, I forgot, this is Texas!). 
   Angel (Danny Arroyo) is impaled on a pipe sticking out of a wall. 
   Jasmine (Jamie Mann) is cut in half by a ceiling fan. Marco, who is 
   more interested in his share of the diamonds than the bloody deaths 
   of his comrades, becomes unglued when Jasmine hides the diamonds and 
   takes their location to her grave. Missy finds the diamonds and she, 
   Keith and Brian must avoid a now-psychotic Marco, as well as the 
   vengeful spirits, while trying to find a way to escape the prison. 
   Will their documentary ever see the light of day? Do you even 
   care?&nbsp; This is typical DTV crapola: Lots of blood and gore (even 
   some of the lousy CGI kind) and a story that makes very little sense, 
   not to metion the outrageous coincidences that dot the screenplay 
   (What are the odds that Marco would pick this abandoned prison to 
   hide in? Why does no one have a cell phone and even if they did, it 
   would probably show &quot;No Service&quot;? Why does an abandoned

   feeling of isolation the viewer gets; being trapped in the middle of 
   the ocean, hundreds, if not thousands, of miles from the nearest dry 
   land and at the mercy of a derelict ghost ship that wants nothing 
   more than to make sure that your soul stays on board for all

   death ship? Most of the time in these films, the radio is on the 
   fritz, all the lifeboats are gone and food and drinkable water are at 
   a minimum, so your only real choices are to fight the evil and hope 
   to God that you win (which usually means that you'll be rescued by a 
   passing ship) or just give up and jump overboard, where you will

    to the next ship's captain, Trevor Marshall (Richard Crenna; <B><A HREF="leviathan_1989.htm">LEVIATHAN</A></B>

   but disdain to both crew and passengers and hates the thought of 
   forced retirement (One of his crew members says, &quot;Bastard! Thank 
   God this will be his last trip.&quot;). Trevor's wife, Margaret 
   (Sally Ann Howes) and their two young children, Robin (Jennifer 
   McKinney) and Ben (Danny Higham), are also on-board the cruise ship 
   to celebrate his promotion. He should have left his family at home. A

   spending several days floating in the sweltering sun, the ghost ship 
   suddenly appears next to them, anchored and not moving. They all 
   board the floating rust bucket, but the ship tries to kill Trevor, 
   Nick and Captain Ashland before they even set foot on-board (a quick-thinking
    Trevor saves the day). Jackie is the first casualty when the ship 
   snares his leg on a rope and drops him overboard, where the ship's 
   spinning propellers grind him to pieces. The ship, which is a German 
   WW II frigate that had a Nazi crew, possesses the vulnerable Captain 
   Ashland (Hey, he gets to captain another ship!), while the rest of 
   the survivors search the ship for food dry clothes and other signs of 
   life. German voices in Captain Ashland's head tell him that this is 
   now &quot;his ship&quot;, so he begins killing the survivors, 
   beginning with Sylvia (who breaks out in facial pustules after eating 
   a peppermint candy she found in a cupboard), whom he strangles when 
   no one else is around and blames her sudden death on &quot;a 
   seizure&quot;. The Captain's obsessive behavior (he now dresses in a 
   German Captain's uniform!) troubles Trevor (When he asks Captain 
   Ashland, &quot;Where do you plan to sail her?&quot;, Ashland replies, 
   &quot;Eternity, Marshall. Eternity!&quot; Oh boy, this does not sound 
   good at all.), so he tries to take control of the ship from Ashland, 
   but the ship won't let him. As Ashland bellows &quot;No one leaves my

   responsible for her death. The film then flashes back, showing us how 
   Franz and Greta ended up this way. Greta is in love with Dr. von 
   Ravensbr&uuml;ck (Giacomo Rossi Stuart; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#NightEvelynGrave71">THE
    NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE</A></B> - 1971) but, right from 
   the start, we know Franz has incestuous feelings towards his sister,

   Greta's hair, wishing he were the doctor.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film then flashes back further in time. It begins with the crash 
   of a horse-drawn carriage in which Greta is a passenger. The coachman 
   lies dead, impaled by one of the carriage wheel shafts (a really 
   graphic shot) and no one knows who Greta is, as she lies unconscious 
   inside the overturned carriage. She is rescued by Walter (Sergio 
   Doria; <B><A HREF="violent_breed_1984.htm">THE VIOLENT BREED</A></B> 
   - 1984), Dr. von Ravensbr&uuml;ck's son, and he brings her back to 
   his mansion, where she is treated by Dr. Sturges (Klaus Kinski; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SlaughterHotel1971">SLAUGHTER
    HOTEL</A></B> - 1971). When Greta wakes up, she has no idea who she 
   is or how she got there, but Dr. Sturges finds a heart-shaped locket 
   on her that has &quot;Greta 1906&quot; engraved on one side and a 
   strange chemical formulation engraved on the other side, which 
   immediately gets the interest of the doctor. Gertrude (the prolific 
   Carla Mancini; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#RedQueenKills1972">THE RED 
   QUEEN KILLS SEVEN TIMES</A></B> - 1972), the von Ravensbr&uuml;ck's 
   maid, seems to recognize Greta and is disturbed by her sudden 
   appearance. Franz shows up at the house to haunt Gertrude (is he a 
   spirit?), while Dr. Sturges is up to no good, injecting Greta in the 
   eye with some unknown solution and then fiddles with the coffin of 
   the dead coachman. Walter is happily married to Eva (Angela Bo; <B><A HREF="secret_confessions_in_a_cloistered_convent_1972.htm">SECRET
    CONFESSIONS IN A CLOISTERED CONVENT</A></B> - 1972) and is seemingly 
   very faithful to her. He asks his butler, Simeon (Marco Mariani; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WhatDoneSolange1972">WHAT
    HAVE YOU DONE TO SOLANGE?</A></B> - 1972), why Gertrude handed in 
   her resignation and Simeon says he doesn't know, but she seemed very 
   troubled when she left. We then see a suitcase-carrying Gertrude 
   outside, running away from someone (Franz?) holding a shotgun. The 
   unknown person corners Gertrude, who says, &quot;No, I won't say 
   anything! I never said anything to anyone!&quot; and then gets both 
   barrels to her face, turning it into raw hamburger (another very 
   graphic scene).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Greta becomes friends with Walter and Eva and Eva even throws a 
   party in her honor, while Dr. Sturges works feverishly in his 
   laboratory.&nbsp; Greta still has no idea who she is, telling Walter 
   that she sometimes feels like a prisoner. At her party, Eva 
   introduces Greta to ballet dancer Maier (Giorgio Dolfin; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Torso1973">TORSO</A></B> 
   - 1973), while both Walter and Eva look at her, passion in their 
   eyes. Dr. Sturges finishes his experiments, pouring his green 
   solution into a bottle, while Greta, Eva and Walter go quail hunting, 
   where Walter tells Greta that he &quot;loves her desperately&quot; 
   and they kiss, Eva seemingly aware what her husband is up to. We then 
   discover that Dr. Sturges has a secret room beneath his laboratory 
   where he experiments on human cadavers. He tells a male corpse that 
   he will live again, because &quot;I possess the secret of life!&quot; 
   Is he on the verge of success? Does he have the power over life and 
   death? And what does Greta's locket have to do with it? Yes, it is 
   true, his formula works, maybe too well, because his male cadaver 
   springs to life, choking the life out of Dr. Sturges and then goes on 
   to kill the doctor's assistant.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Meanwhile, Eva tries to drown Greta in the bathtub, but she stops, 
   telling Greta that she love her, too. Yes, there is a very strange 
   love triangle sandwich in the Ravensbr&uuml;ck home, with Greta as 
   the meat, as Walter and Eva take turns making love to Greta. It turns 
   out Eva is quite jealous. She drags Greta to a basement room, sealing 
   the door with brick and mortar, telling Walter that Greta left 
   without a word. Walter phones Inspector Dannick (Attilio Dottesio; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#EscapeGalaxy3-1981">ESCAPE
    FROM GALAXY 3</A></B> - 1981) and he tells Walter he will look for 
   her. Two weeks pass and the Inspector tells Walter and Eva that Greta 
   is nowhere to be found and it would be hopeless to look for her any 
   longer. Eva is so happy, she throws a masquerade ball, where she sees 
   a mask-wearing Greta in the crowd. Eva runs to the basement and 
   starts tearing down the wall she built, where a black cat jumps out 
   and scares her half to death. Before she can check the room, she sees 
   Greta at the top of the stairs and tries to escape, but no matter 
   where she turns, Greta is there (sometimes with the face of a 
   decomposing corpse) and Eva falls out of a window, splattering her 
   brains on the cobblestones below. The Inspector, who discovers the 
   empty bricked-up basement room and interviews guests at the party, 
   believes Greta is alive and out for vengeance. Walter's father shows 
   up for Eva's funeral and sees Greta off in the distance, watching the 
   funeral. Is it possible Dr. von Ravensbr&uuml;ck knew Greta long 
   before she lost her memory in that carriage accident? And what about 
   the reanimated cadaver? What has he been up to all this time? And 
   what is Franz's involvement in all this? If you want to know, I 
   suggest you rent or buy this film.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This is easily Joe D'Amato's most accessible film, for the simple 
   reason that the story is linear and easy to understand, unlike his 
   later films,<A HREF="death_smiles_on_a_murderer_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/death smiles at murder dvd8a front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   where sequences jump from scene to scene without reason.&nbsp; Yet, 
   this film lacks D'Amato's usual sleaze factor, which makes most of 
   his films memorable. Sure, there is plenty of female nudity (some 
   full-frontal) and lots of graphic violence, but it lacks D'Amato's 
   sleazy touch. Most of the sex and violence is shown matter-of-factly, 
   without any flair at all. The screenplay, by D'Amato, Claudio 
   Bernabei &amp; Romano Scandariato (<B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DoctorButcher1980">DOCTOR
    BUTCHER M.D.</A></B> - 1980), pays homage to the works of Edgar 
   Allan Poe, such as being buried alive behind a brick wall (&quot;The 
   Cask Of Amontillado&quot;), the masquerade party (&quot;The Masque Of 
   The Red Death&quot;), a cat attacking (&quot;The Black Cat&quot;) and 
   even Sergio Doria as Walter looks and dresses like Poe, making this a 
   good little film to play &quot;Spot The Reference&quot;. Not that 
   this is a good film, it's not, but it is a well-photographed (by 
   D'Amato) little horror film that has some history to it. I remember 
   seeing this on TV in the mid-'70s and being bored to tears. It was 
   one of 13 Spanish and Italian horror films that Avco Embassy released 
   as part of their &quot;Nightmare Theater&quot; package, all of them 
   severely edited for nudity and violence. Without either of those (the 
   TV version was missing the scene of Greta making mincemeat of Walter 
   with a surgical saw and then impaling his naked body to a door, as 
   well as most of the other scenes I mentioned in this review), this 
   film was a complete bore on TV, as well as making no sense at all. It 
   does make sense in its unedited version, though, and is not quite as boring.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   version of this outrageous and unpredictable low-budget gem. Glenn

    porno movie. Not knowing her name, he tracks her down with a little 
   investigative work and finds out her name is Greta and she plays 
   piano at a bar run by the mysterious George (J. Martin Sellers). 
   Greta is a strange girl. She likes to walk around half-naked, use 
   profanity and fuck Glenn like a rabbit (much to the pleasure of 
   Glenn's elderly neighbors; a running gag throughout the film). Greta 
   and George indoctrinate Glenn into their club, whose members meet 
   regularly and try to cheat death. Glenn's first meeting with the club 
   involves sitting around a table while a poisonous giant beetle is let 
   loose, flying around the table picking out a victim to sting. 
   (Stop-motion animation was later added to the edited version in </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">NIGHT

   to make the scene more believable.) Glenn is disgusted with the

   crash landing (the wino's immediately killed by the creature as soon 
   as he stumbles out of the police station), Ian and Jerry head back to 
   the crash site only to be refused entry by government soldiers 
   carrying automatic weapons. Ian smells a rat (or rather, an alien) 
   and his suspicions are confirmed when Captain Robertson informs him 
   that the case is closed (all the deaths are classified as 
   &quot;accidents&quot;) and he then suspends Ian and Jerry from the

   (Julie Newmar; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Evils of the Night">EVILS

   female cop Carla (Ann Turkel; <B><A HREF="humanoids_from_the_deep_1980.htm">HUMANOIDS

   like a giant cockroach egg, they bring it to Professor Whately (Fox 
   Harris), who opens the pod and is killed by a miniature version of 
   the creature. After killing the small monster, Ian realizes that 
   Jerry has a pod at his house. Ian and Carla race over there, but they 
   are too late. Jerry is dead and is being eaten from the inside out by 
   the second small creature. Lady Wentworth informs Ian that if he 
   wants to stop the infestation, he is going to have to kill the large 
   creature, which is capable of laying many more eggs. Ian, Carla and 
   Captain Robertson confront the creature in a warehouse in the film's

   in horror film history, where Charles Napier (who is excellent, as

   she agrees to take off her clothes if he stops playing! The film is 
   full of little comical moments and dialogue and, while some of it is 
   groan-inducing, there are some inspired scenes, like when Ian pulls 
   the small creature off of Professor Whately and accidentally tosses 
   it right into Carla's face. There's also some pretty good gore (the 
   main creature has tentacles that shoot out of it's vagina-like 
   opening that attach themselves to the victims' bodies and tear them 
   apart) and the creature itself is a goofy, but effective, concoction

   story begins with clumsy novice reporter <A HREF="bestoink_dooley_horror_host_photo.htm">Bestoink
    Dooley</A> (George Ellis, an Atlanta, Georgia-based TV horror host 
   during the '60's) investigating the legend of a monster residing on 
   Blood Mountain. While on the mountain he meets a doctor, his 
   daughter, his female assistant and a forest ranger. After countless 
   scenes of driving and bad post-synch dubbing, the monster finally 
   appears. You'll wish it didn't. It is a laughably bad creation. 
   Dooley destroys it with a flame thrower after a protracted,

   for the actual film itself. Notorious director, producer and 
   all-around roustabout Donn Davison added some scenes featuring a new 
   monster, some gore and himself as a respected professor, cut out all 
   the previous monster footage and released it as <B><A HREF="legend_of_mcculloughs_mountain_1965_1976.htm">THE

    The original version was released on video in the late '80's by Camp 
   Video missing an entire reel at about the 50 minute mark. The 
   approximately 80 minute film has an actual running time of 65 minutes 
   in this version! To add insult to injury, Camp Video's box trumpets 
   the fact that this film features rare footage of Kenny Roger's 
   ex-wife, Marianne Gordon. It's rare indeed. She is shown drinking 
   Pepsi out of a vintage can for about 30 seconds and she doesn't have 
   a speaking part! Add to that endless scenes which seem to go on 
   forever, such as in the beginning where Dooley is in bed eating 
   cookies and drinking milk for what feels like hours and what you get 
   is a film that can only be viewed if your sense of enjoyment leans 
   towards the masochistic. Also starring Erin Fleming, Sheila Stringer

    Once in Sicily, Liza becomes obsessed with the ruins of the Santa 
   Rosita Monastery, even though Professor Evans tells her that the 
   monastery has nothing whatsoever to do with the expedition. The mayor 
   of the small village pays the Professor a visit and warns him not to 
   ask the villagers any questions, they are very private people and 
   don't like to talk to strangers and trying to question them could be 
   extremely dangerous, even deadly. The Professor and Liza then go to 
   visiting oceanographic anthropologist Porter (Al Cliver; Fulci's <B><A HREF="beyond_1981.htm">THE
    BEYOND</A></B> - 1981) on his boat and he tells Liza to stay away 
   from the monastery, because the locals will kill to keep their 
   secrets. Porter tells them that the locals will refuse to help them 
   at all, because they believe that the &quot;past belongs dead.&quot; 
   He is right, of course, as the locals refuse to even acknowledge Liza 
   when she walks into the village and one local, butcher Turi DeSimone 
   (Lino Salemme; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#GraveyardDisturb88">GRAVEYARD
    DISTURBANCE</A></B> - 1988), threatens Liza's life if he sees her at 
   the monastery again. One night, Liza walks to the monastery in a 
   trance-like state and destroys a fresco of a nun with her pickaxe, 
   opening a hole in the wall that leads her to the room where the nuns 
   were crucified over 500 years ago, their skeletons still hanging on 
   the large wooden crosses. The sight of the murdered nuns snaps Liza 
   out of her trance and she screams and runs away. This discovery leads 
   to a series of gory murders perpetrated by the ghosts of the nuns.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The first to die is Porter, who returns to his boat after going on a 
   booze run. He finds the lights on, which seems strange since he knows 
   he turned them off. He enters the boat's living quarters, only to 
   have a headless ghostly nun (!) kill him with a spear gun bolt to his 
   chest. Expedition crewmembers Kevin (Pascal Druant; <B><A HREF="blue_tornado_1990.htm">BLUE
    TORNADO</A></B> - 1990) and Sean (Grady Thomas Clarkson; <B><A HREF="arena_1989.htm">ARENA</A></B> 
   - 1989) use the monastery as a place to secretly drink, away from the 
   nasty Professor (who just got done yelling at his crew for singing!), 
   when they hear the sound of women laughing in the distance. They both 
   go to investigate and fall into a pit full of sharp spikes and end up 
   dead with several wooden spikes impaled through their bodies. When 
   their bodies are discovered, Interpol agent Inspector Carter (Lucio 
   Fulci, in an extended uncredited cameo) and his partner Lt. Andi 
   (Michael J. Aronin; <B><A HREF="lone_runner_1986.htm">THE LONE RUNNER</A></B> 
   - 1986) question Professor Evans and Inspector Carter tells him he 
   will hold him responsible if there are any more deaths. He tells the 
   Professor that his wife is from this village, so he better not talk 
   to any of the locals if he knows what's good for him. Inspector 
   Carter and Lt. Andi then look for the missing Porter on his boat and 
   find his severed head attached to the boat's anchor. Lt. Andi accuses 
   the Professor of being the murderer of Porter based on a ten-year-old 
   story (and Lt. Andi's love for detective novels!) where the Professor 
   refuted one of Porter's discoveries, which resulted in the Professor 
   losing his profession and his standing among his peers when he was 
   proved wrong. The Professor denies the allegation, telling Lt. Andi 
   that it is all water under the bridge; he and Porter made up and were 
   now friends, but the Professor wonders if he and his crew should pull 
   out of Sicily and head back to Toronto.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Liza then meets a medium/cat lady named Lilla (Carla Cassola; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Sect1991">THE
    SECT</A></B> - 1991), who tells Liza that the five crucified nuns 
   were actually beautiful satanic witches who (cue the flashbacks!) 
   invited young men to join them in orgies and would kill them (by 
   stabbing them in the neck) as they reached orgasm, drinking their 
   blood and then going insane with delirium. If any of the nuns became 
   pregnant, they would deliver their babies and then immediately throw 
   them into a fire as a sacrifice to Satan (end of the flashbacks!). 
   Lilla tells Liza not to tell anyone what she has just heard if she 
   wants to stay alive; what she needs to do is ask God for help. When 
   Liza leaves Lilla's home, Lilla's collection of cats go on a flesh 
   frenzy and attack Lilla (after she hears the nuns laughing), 
   graphically tearing out her eyes and eating them.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    A ghostly nun enters Turi's butcher shop and impales Turi in the 
   neck with a meat hook. She's not done with him, though, as she nails 
   his tongue to a butcher's block (!) and finishes him off by locking 
   him in the freezing meat locker (in typical Fulci overkill). 
   Inspector Carter finds a piece of ancient cloth next to Turi's frozen 
   body and now knows that the Professor is not involved.&nbsp; Robbie 
   (Francesco Cusimano), a young boy who is the son of crewmembers Susie

   booby trap, both his legs tied between two bent trees. His father 
   tells him not to move, but Robbie doesn't listen and steps on the 
   tripwire. He watches his father being torn in half, from nuts to neck 
   (really graphic and gory) as his blood sprays all over a shocked 
   Bobby's body.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Just as the Professor is ready to call it quits, one of his 
   crewmembers tells him he has made an important discovery and the 
   Professor changes his mind, but makes it clear to Liza that she has 
   to stop obsessing about the monastery, that's not why they are here. 
   Liza doesn't listen and goes back to the monastery, which riles up 
   the locals, who band together and crucify Liza on a wooden cross, 
   just like their ancestors did to the five nuns. But they take an 
   extra step and burn Liza alive, as the Professor enters the room and 
   mourns her death. But Liza then appears dead on the stone floor, her 
   body no longer burned. For the Professor, it's all too little, too 
   late, as the film ends with the image of a dead Liza lying on the floor.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While this film looks very cheap, especially the low-quality gore 
   effects (by Franco Giannini; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#rATMAN">THE 
   RAT MAN</A></B> - 1987), Lucio Fulci does manage to imbue this film 
   with a dream-like quality. One such scene shows the Professor yelling 
   to Liza from a far distance not to enter the monastery, while Liza is 
   standing in the middle of the ruins of an ancient stone amphitheater. 
   You have to admire Fulci's sense of style, even<A HREF="demonia_1990.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/demonia poster1a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="206" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   though it is obvious he didn't have a lot of money to work with, yet 
   he instills a sense of extreme mystery and awe with his camera 
   setups, none more imaginative than this sequence, shot from both 
   protagonist's point-of-view. It is a beautiful well-shot scene, 
   worthy of a big-budget epic, not a low-budget horror film, yet here 
   it is. That's not to say this film doesn't have its share of 
   problems. The screenplay, by Fulci and Piero Regnoli (<B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#PatrickStillLives80">PATRICK
    STILL LIVES</A></B> - 1980; and Fulci's <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#VoicesFromBeyond91">VOICES
    FROM BEYOND</A></B> - 1991), is pretty weak. It seems to be just a 
   series of shock/gore sequences with very little connective tissue 
   between scenes. The pacing is also languid and Brett Halsey's 
   Professor Paul Evans is off-putting, denigrating Liza when he should 
   be supporting her and putting his expedition before Liza's 
   well-being. He's not a very nice man, to Liza or his crew, who let 
   off a little steam at night by singing songs around a campfire, only 
   to have the Professor yell at them for not allowing him to sleep. 
   Even though some of the cinematography is very lavish, the film still 
   has the look and feel of a TV movie, such as Fulci's <B><A HREF="sweet_house_of_horrors_1989.htm">SWEET
    HOUSE OF HORRORS</A></B> (1989), <B><A HREF="house_of_clocks_1989.htm">THE

    OF DEATH</A></B> (1990; also starring Halsey). Still, the film's 
   dream-like quality, mixed with bloody gore (no matter how cheap it 
   looks), manage to propel this film past the ordinary and into a 
   territory I recommend whole-heartedly. It's not prime Fulci, but it 
   still contains more plusses than negatives. A lot of critics give 
   this film bad reviews, but I invite them to view this film again and 
   reassess their opinions. I am willing to bet a lot of them will, for 
   the simple reason that time heals most wounds. It's funny how films 
   we hated when we were younger become classics or semi-classics as we 
   become older. This is one of those films, at least for me. Parts of 
   this film may remind viewers of Fulci's <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CityLivingDead1980">CITY
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> (1980; the opening s&eacute;ance scene) 
   or any of his early-'80s gore flicks and that's never a bad thing, 
   but this film contains enough atmosphere to survive in its own 
   universe, especially the real ruins that are actually in Sicily, 
   Italy, giving this film an authentic look and feel, something which 
   couldn't be done on a stage with sets (even though Fulci was also a

   a personal style. But when you have to work with hack producer 
   Charles Band and his Full Moon Productions, you can basically throw 
   all your personal visions out the window. Even though Jay co-wrote 
   the screenplay (along with Tim Sullivan), this is still <A HREF="demonicus_2001.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/demonicus vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="176" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>standard
    Full Moon crap about a group of students who are on a hike (and some 
   type of contest) in the Italian Alps (actually filmed at Angeles 
   National Park in L.A.). When James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) finds a cave 
   with a preserved Gladiator, he dons the costume and becomes possessed 
   and begins killing the rest of the group one-by-one, cutting off 
   their arms, legs and heads and bringing back their body parts to the 
   cave where he performs a ritual to try and bring back to life the 
   long-dead Gladiator Demonicus. He nearly succeeds a couple of times 
   but is thwarted by knowledgable female professor Maria (Jennifer 
   Capo) and nerdy Dino (Brannon Gould). Budget restraints 
   notwithstanding, this film is very bloody in spots (courtesy of 
   legendary badfilm director and effects master Joe Castro of <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Jackhammer">JACKHAMMER
    MASSACRE</A></B> [2003] fame), as arms are hacked off, a leg is 
   sliced off, Dino is run-through with a sword and there's a pretty 
   convincing beheading. But the plot is so absurd and the situations so 
   unbelievable, that I doubt that even Jay would count this as one of 
   his favorites. The real problem though is that Jay didn't do his own 
   music soundtrack for the film. This one has a droning synthesizer 
   score that's headache-inducing (courtesy of Danny Draven), something 
   that Jay would never do. His scores are haunting and add a great deal 
   to his films atmosphere. At least it's only 72 minutes long, so it 
   doesn't overstay it's welcome. While this is better than most of the 
   latter-day Full Moon films (thanks to Jay's POV blood shots and 
   better-than-average acting), it's still nothing to write home about. 
   Would someone please give Jay Woelfel the money he needs to make a 
   film on his terms? When that happens, he always turns out quality 
   product, not by-the-numbers stuff like this to make a living. Also 
   starring Venesa Talor, Kyle Tracy, Allen Nabors, Candace Kroslak and 
   Todd Rex as Demonicus. Released under <A HREF="http://www.fullmoondirect.com">Full

   (Mike Lane) that traps everyone in the house and begins possessing 
   people to do his bidding, which usually ends in murder. Harris tells 
   Remy that the only way to find out what the demon wants is to perform

   appears and tells the group that since they have awakened him from

   (1987). <B><A HREF="demon_keeper_1993b.htm">DEMON KEEPER</A></B> is a 
   bland horror film that only comes to life during the several nude 
   scenes (one guy is crushed between the legs of a possessed woman 
   while they are having sex, in the film's most inspired moment). Both 
   Edward Albert and Dirk Benedict are simply awful here and look like 
   they would rather be drinking in a bar than appearing in this dreary 
   film. The script, by frequent Tornatore collaborator Mikel Angel (<B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Love Butcher">THE
    LOVE BUTCHER</A></B> - 1975), is a slow-paced and uneventful haunted 
   house thriller where nothing much happens during the film's scant 72 
   minute running time. The gore is also minimal and pretty badly done. 
   There is a quick shot of a dog tearing-out a woman's throat, a couple 
   of stabbings (one shown in silhouette) and plenty of bad optical 
   effects (by David L. Hewitt). The demon costume is pretty good, but 
   it is never used in a manner to induce fear or shocks, even though he 
   is the most animated person in the whole film. Everyone else in this 
   film acts as if they are in some sort of trance, giving the whole 
   film a lethargic pace. I really can't see any point in spending more 
   time explaining just how boring this film really is. Let's just say 
   it's bad and leave it at that. The film is set in Connecticut, but 
   was actually filmed in Zimbabwe, Africa. Also starring Andre Jacobs,

    OF PARADISE</A><A NAME="DemonOfParadise"></A> (1987) -</B> A group 
   of fishermen in Kihono, Hawaii are illegally fishing with dynamite 
   when they unleash a long-dormant creature (in other words, a man in a 
   rubber suit). After causing the fishermen to blow up their own boat, 
   the creature then goes on a killing spree. The local natives believe 
   that a mystical beast called Acua has returned, so they perform an 
   ancient ritual (lots of hula dancing) to keep the creature at bay so 
   they can continue fishing. It doesn't work. Local cop Keefer (William 
   Steis), who use to be a sheriff in Reno, Nevada until a serial killer 
   made him lose his edge, joins forces with visiting herpatologist 
   (it's a reptile expert, stupid!) Dr. Annie Essex (Kathryn Witt) to 
   get to the bottom of the killings. Complicating matters is nosey 
   tabloid reporter Ike (scripter Frederick Bailey), who is working in 
   cahoots with down-on-her-luck resort owner Cahill (Laura Banks) to 
   publicize the creature's sudden appearance, so it makes the resort a

    shipment of TNT to arrive, which they plan on selling to the local 
   fishermen (the ones that aren't superstitious, that is). As the 
   tourists start pouring in, the killings begin to escalate and Keefer 
   wants to close down the resort's lake, but in true <B><A HREF="jaws_1975.htm">JAWS</A></B> 
   (1975) fashion, Cahill refuses and tells Keefer to do his job 
   (&quot;I'm not going to let anyone railroad me!&quot;). Cahill holds 
   a &quot;Creature Egg Hunt&quot;, where the tourists search for eggs 
   hidden around the resort (you've got to be kidding me!), but when 
   Keefer and his men have a shootout with Langley and Shelton and the 
   creature puts in an appearance and kills Shelton, all the tourists 
   leave the resort in a panic. Keefer calls in the National Guard and 
   they drop grenades on the creature from a helicopter. This just 
   pisses-off the creature, as it then walks on land for the first time 
   and traps everyone in the resort's main cabin. The creature begins 
   picking off people one-by-one and then chases the remaining survivors 
   to the ruins of an ancient temple, where the creature faces-off with 
   Keefer, Annie and the National Guard in the film's explosive 
   finale.&nbsp; This is prolific Filipino director Cirio H. Santiago's 
   second horror film (after <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Vampire Hookers">VAMPIRE
    HOOKERS</A></B> - 1979) and it's easy to see why he didn't make any 
   more. He stinks at it. This is basically a remake of <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#UpFromTheDepths">UP
    FROM THE DEPTHS</A></B> (1979; which Santiago produced) and it's a 
   boring mess, with long stretches where nothing happens, followed by 
   an explosion every now and then, followed by an appearance of the 
   creature, which is laughable at best. The subplot about Keefer's past 
   is never fleshed out, besides him saying &quot;I came here to get 
   away from this stuff!&quot; when the murders begin to happen and then 
   later mentioning to Annie that he is a widower (we never really know 
   if the serial killer back in Reno murdered his wife). The film is 
   also rather dry and relatively gore-free for a horror film. The 
   creature attack scenes are few and far between (the sparse gore 
   consists of after-effects of the creature attacks, like slash marks 
   on the face and chest of it's victims), as Santiago would rather 
   focus on the action elements of the film, like Langley and Shelton's 
   dynamite exploits and several gunfights and explosions. Santiago 
   could be an efficient director when faced with the right material 
   (see reviews of <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#FinalMission1984">FINAL MISSION</A></B>

   but he seems uncomfortable when it comes to directing horror. He 
   plays it way too safe, which is probably why he didn't make more of 
   them after this. Almost all of Santiago's action and post-nuke flicks (<B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Stryker1983">STRYKER</A></B>

   (1981) -</B> Mexican-made horror film with an international cast. The 
   film opens with a woman stealing a severed hand out of a silver case 
   (which is shaped like a hand) in a cave occupied by a religious sect 
   dressed like the Ku Klux Klan (only with yellow hoods and robes). The 
   woman becomes instantly possessed and gains superhuman powers in her 
   left hand, but is overpowered by members of the sect, who chain her 
   now-topless body to a cave wall and chop-off her left hand with an 
   axe (nothing is left to the imagination). The hand tries escape on 
   its own, but a sect member stabs it with a knife and puts it in the 
   silver case, waiting patiently for the next person to open it and 
   become possessed. We then switch to the present day, where Jennifer 
   Barnes (Samantha Eggar; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Curtains1982">CURTAINS</A></B> 
   - 1982) arrives in Guanajuato, Mexico to spend some time with her

   Jenson&quot;), an investor in a silver mine. Jennifer enters the mine 
   by herself (in high heels and an evening dress, but she still has 
   enough sense to wear a hardhat!) and accidentally disturbs some 
   rocks, exposing a rotting corpse missing its left hand (the woman 
   from the beginning, perhaps?) and a huge chunk of silver (Which begs 
   the question: How did Jennifer discover this so easily in an area the 
   miners walk through on a daily basis?). Pepe (Jose Chavez Trowe), 
   Mark's right-hand man (no pun intended), tells Mark and Jennifer that 
   the mine is cursed with the &quot;Devil's Hand&quot;, a <A HREF="demonoid_messenger_of_death_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/demonoid ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="168" HEIGHT="320" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>centuries-old
    legend, and now that she has exposed the one-handed corpse, none of 
   the superstitious locals will enter the mine and do their jobs. 
   Jennifer hopes to shame the locals into going back to work by 
   traveling down to the deepest part of the mine with just her husband 
   and they make it there after several close calls (A human skull falls 
   into Jennifer's hands and Mark jokingly says, &quot;What, are you 
   collecting those?&quot;). Mark falls through a sand pit into a lower 
   chamber that contains a sacrificial temple to the demon with only one 
   hand. After Jennifer joins him in the chamber, they find the silver 
   hand case and bring it topside. All hell breaks loose after that. 
   Mark shows the case to the workers and they all run away in fear. 
   That night, a drunk and distraught Mark opens the case and discovers 
   nothing but ash inside. He goes to sleep, but the ash transforms into 
   a crawling hand that tries to attack Jennifer. Mark grabs the Devil's 
   Hand and becomes instantly possessed; his left hand has a mind of its 
   own and it's up to no good. The next morning, Mark forces all the 
   mineworkers back into the mine and blows it up with dynamite, killing 
   everyone. Mark escapes to the Sands Casino in Las Vegas, where his 
   possessed left hand makes him a big winner at the craps table, but he 
   is knocked out in the parking lot by hustlers Frankie (Ted White) and 
   Angela (Russ Meyer regular Haji, billed here as &quot;Haji 
   Catton&quot;) and driven to a shack in the desert, where he is tied 
   to a table and questioned about his &quot;system&quot; for winning. 
   Mark breaks free and kills them both and, in a moment of clarity, 
   douses himself in gasoline and sets himself on fire, but the left 
   hand buries itself in the sand to avoid being burned. Mark's body is 
   claimed by Father Cunningham (Stuart Whitman; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Night Of The Lepus">NIGHT
    OF THE LEPUS</A></B> - 1972) and buried in Los Angeles (Why he 
   claims Mark's body is never fully explained, but it does move the 
   action to L.A.). Jennifer is convinced that her husband is still 
   possessed and not technically dead, so she goes to Los Angeles, where 
   the burnt corpse of Mark rises from the grave, severs his left hand 
   in the door of a police car and possesses the body of Sgt. Leo Matson 
   (Lew Saunders), a cop friend of Father Cunningham. Can the good 
   Father and Jennifer get the hand back in the silver case before more 
   people get the nickname &quot;Lefty&quot;?&nbsp; Silly beyond belief, <B><A HREF="demonoid_messenger_of_death_1981b.htm">DEMONOID</A></B>

   - 1989), who co-wrote the mind-numbing screenplay with David Lee Fein 
   and F. Amos Powell, has made an unintentionally hilarious 
   supernatural chiller, as he tries to show how many different ways 
   people can sever their left hand from their bodies. Besides the axe 
   and car door dismemberments, there's removal by laser at a doctor's 
   office, getting run over by a train, cut off by car windshield during 
   an auto accident and removal by blowtorch. There's not much more to 
   the story than that, as the possessed hand passes from body-to-body. 
   Samantha Eggar knows fully well that she picked a stinker to star in, 
   so she plays her role so earnestly, she becomes a parody of herself 
   (especially during the &quot;What The Fuck?!?&quot; finale). Toss in

   make. I originally watched this film after picking up a bootleg VHS 
   tape of it in the late-'90s at a Fangoria convention in New York 
   City. It bored me to tears, thanks to the tape not being dubbed or 
   subtitled in English. I have been watching a lot of late-'80s Italian 
   genre films lately, so I decided to give this film another chance 
   since I found an English-dubbed print streaming on YouTube. I wanted 
   to see if my opinion changed about it, since most of the other 
   late-'80s flicks have drastically altered my opinion about them<A HREF="demons_6_de_profundis_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/demons 6 de profundis aka the black cat amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="199" HEIGHT="293" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>,
    whether it be because I am older and wiser (?) or that I gleaned

    Two women in a car stop at a building, where one woman gets out and 
   shouts for a man named George, calling him a murderer while a black 
   cat (the first insert) watches in the shadows and the woman in the

   what it is about until he finds a producer to finance it (Marc is 
   very superstitious). Marc is also very worried about making a flop 
   and ending up directing game shows, telling Anne that some producers

   and Anne drive home, where they talk to Sara (Luisa Maneri; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Bodycount">BODY

    Nora (Caroline Munro; Cozzi's <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Starcrash">STARCRASH</A></B>

   screenwriter Dan Grudzinski (Maurizio Fardo; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Raiders Of Atlantis">RAIDERS
    OF ATLANTIS</A></B> - 1983), who is writing the script for Marc's 
   new film. While Dan and Nora are having dinner with Marc and Anne, 
   Marc announces that his new film has found a producer. His name is 
   Leonard Levin (Brett Halsey; <B><A HREF="#Demonia1990">DEMONIA</A></B> 
   - 1990), a producer who was big in the 1960's, but since then has

   the new film is based on Thomas De Quincey's novel &quot;<B><I><FONT COLOR="NAVY">Suspiria
    de Profundis</FONT></I></B>&quot; (de Profundis meaning &quot;From 
   The Depths&quot;), which deals with Levana, the Third Mother, better 
   known as The Mother Of Tears (Marc even drops Dario Argento's name in 
   the conversation). When Nora and Dan leave, Marc tells Anne he wants 
   her to portray Levana, saying the part was written just for her. I 
   guess he should have told Dan that, because Nora also wants the part 
   badly and she tells Dan she will do anything to get it, even if it 
   means sleeping with Marc! Dan just laughs and doesn't take her 
   seriously, but he should.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While Anne is rehearsing the role of Levana in front of her living 
   room mirror, the demon Levana (a pustuled creature with glowing eyes) 
   crashes through the mirror and tells Anne that she, nor anyone else, 
   will portray her or tell her story in a film. If they try they are 
   dead. Levana then disappears (after puking a slimy green substance 
   and blood all over Anne's body) and when Anne looks at the mirror, 
   it's no longer broken. So, did this actually happen or is it all in 
   Anne's fertile imagination? What do you think (It is a horror film, 
   after all)? Marc doesn't believe Anne when she tells him what just 
   happened, pointing to the mirror to show her it isn't broken and 
   telling her she is just stressed, so they go to sleep. Levana's voice 
   wakes up a sleeping Anne, telling her she no longer needs the mirror 
   to materialize and threatens her life once again if she continues 
   acting in the film. This is when the strange shit begins to happen.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   is an invalid in a wheelchair. He tells Marc and Dan he is impressed 
   with the short story treatment they have supplied him, complaining 
   that other filmmakers and screenwriters submit screenplays that are 
   hundreds of pages long and don't tell as much as their four page 
   treatment does. He agrees to finance the film, but he insists on 
   taking a hands-on approach to making the film, as he considers it to 
   be his comeback into the world of movies. Marc is taken aback, 
   thinking a director should be the boss of the film, but he needs 
   financing so badly, he agrees to Leonard Levin's terms. When Marc and 
   Dan leave, it is quite apparent that Leonard and Nadine are working 
   with Levana, but why?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   &quot;electrical malfunction&quot; in the house the night before) and 
   he tells her it is all fixed, handing her the bill. She then meets 
   Sara's young cousin William (actor unknown), who is watching Baby 
   Marc in his room. When Anne talks to Sara, telling her that she has 
   just spoken to William, Sara tells her that it couldn't be, William 
   called her and told her that he couldn't make it. Anne runs to Baby 
   Marc's room and nobody is there, just the baby, so she goes 
   downstairs to talk to the repairman, only to discover the 
   refrigerator is still broken and the bill she was given is now

    FROM BEYOND</A></B> - 1991), a professor of mysticism and the 
   occult, as well as a medium, to act as a consultant on the film, to 
   give it a sense of realism. She makes Marc aware that Levana is real 
   and was the most evil witch that ever lived. She can possess anyone 
   who concentrates on her long enough. She prefers to possess women, 
   but only if they were born under a certain constellation of stars 
   (Can you guess where Anne was born? There's also confusing sequences 
   set in outer space where a &quot;star child' is born, which will

   must sacrifice a newborn child to get revenge on those who burned her 
   at the stake (Confused yet? I am, too!). Unfortunately, Esther 
   doesn't get a chance to be a consultant on the film, for as she is

    To make matters more confusing, Anne meets little girl Sybil (Giada 
   Cozzi, the director's daughter), who she can only talk to on her TV 
   set! Sybil tells Anne she's a fairy and Anne has also been one all 
   her life, she just doesn't know how to use her powers. She also tells 
   Anne that there is very little difference between a fairy and a 
   witch, which is what Levana is. We then watch Anne putting makeup on 
   herself to look like Levana and then she stabs Marc, who then stabs 
   Anne and they both die. It all turns out to be one of Anne's 
   nightmares, but why is &quot;You Are Not Levana&quot; written in 
   blood on one of Baby Marc's bedroom walls and why is Baby Marc 
   missing? Marc believes Anne is responsible for both and storms out of 
   the house in a huff.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then discover that Marc has been having an affair with Nora and 
   offered her the role of Levana in his film. Marc tells Nora he 
   believes Anne is responsible for Baby Marc's disappearance, but he is 
   sure she will never harm him. He is worried that her mind won't be 
   able to accept the news that she is no longer the star of his film, 
   but Nora insists he tells her. A badly injured Dan, who was 
   mysteriously attacked in his country home when he was writing the 
   film's actual screenplay, drives his car into Marc's house and 
   implies to Anne that Leonard Levin is responsible for all the deaths 
   and Baby Marc's disappearance, then he dies. Anne drives to Levin's 
   house and finds him dead, but still able to talk! He tries to get 
   Anne to commit suicide by shooting herself in the head, but she uses 
   her powers to turn the gun on Levin and shoot him in the head, which 
   stops him from talking. Anne then shoots and kills Nadine, who comes 
   at her with a knife. Before she dies, Nadine tells Anne that Nora has 
   her baby.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    It turns out that Nora and Marc are working with Levana to stop Anne

   seriously disappointed with both of them for failing to stop Anne, so 
   she kills Marc by blowing up Nora's car as he is waiting for her to 
   return. Levana hands Nora a straight razor and demands she kills 
   herself, which Nora does by slitting her own throat.

   Baby Marc and Levana decides to kill Anne on her own. It won't be 
   easy, especially when Anne discovers how to use her fairy powers, 
   which she seemingly has the ability to shoot lasers from her 
   fingertips and bend time and space. Who will win this battle? Expect 
   lots of cheap optical effects in this battle, where Sara reveals 
   herself to be the reincarnation of Levana. Just when it seems that 
   Anne won and the world is back in order now, baby Marc reveals he has 
   glowing eyes, just like Levana. Jesus Christ, does this mean there's 
   going to be a sequel? Don't worry, it never happened, but Cozzi is 
   still with us, so never say never!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    One thing I always admired about Luigi Cozzi is that no matter how 
   low budget and cheap his films are, he manages to imbue them with a 
   sense of awe, wonder and playfulmess, something this film is 
   definitely missing. It's not like he doesn't try here and there 
   (especially in the film-within-the-film, which is lit with neon 
   colors like Argento's films, but this film's dominate color is a 
   nauseating neon pea soup green), but he fails miserably. Most of the 
   film doesn't make a lick of sense, especially Anne's newfound powers 
   and her spirit guide Sybil, who can only be seen on the TV screen. I 
   can always forgive a film not making much sense, but this film is 
   just too boring and slow for me to do that. It is apparent Cozzi is a 
   big fan of Argento, as he peppers this film with a lot of homages to 
   the first two Three Mothers films (see how many you can spot). 
   Cozzi's next film after this one would be the documentary/love letter 
   to his idol, titled <B><A HREF="dario_argento_master_of_horror_1991.htm">DARIO
    ARGENTO: MASTER OF HORROR</A></B> (1991). Even Michele Soavi made 
   his own documentary of the Master (just like Cozzi, he worked on many 
   of Argento's films in some capacity), titled <B><A HREF="dario_argentos_world_of_horror_1985.htm">DARIO
    ARGENTO'S WORLD OF HORROR</A></B> (1985). Both those documentaries 
   are much better than this film. I really don't have much more to say 
   about this film, other than to ask why Italian horror films of the 
   '80s depend so much on heavy metal songs to transition from 
   scene-to-scene, like this one does? My opinion hasn't changed much 
   about this film when I first saw it in the late-'90s. Cozzi's film 
   just before this, titled <B><A HREF="paganini_horror_1989.htm">PAGANINI
    HORROR</A></B> (1988), is just as ridiculous, but much more fun. I

   foggy neon lighting and solarized flashback footage that recent

   daughter killed and taken away by a bigfoot creature. A bunch of 
   teenagers rent the same cabin where the bigfoot attack took place and 
   soon they are also attacked by the bigfoot, the majority of them 
   being killed and taken away. The rest of them team up with George 
   Kennedy, who has set up camp nearby in hopes of killing the bigfoot 
   in retribution for the death of his daughter. But all is not what it 
   seems. It turns out that the alien whose spacecraft crash landed one 
   hundred years ago is still alive and is turning all the humans into 
   zombie slaves so they can fix his ship. The preacher from the 
   beginning is still alive and has not aged. He performs sacrifices on 
   some humans, cutting out their hearts and feeding them to the alien. 
   The alien also has the power to turn any human into a bigfoot, 
   thereby providing him with a way to kidnap and kill campers 
   (including an almost always nude Michelle Bauer) and keep his supply 
   of zombie workers. Nearly everyone dies and the film ends on is it or 
   is it not a dream finale. There's a lot to like here: Plenty of 
   nudity, a great bigfoot costume (by John Carl Buechler, who also 
   wrote the story the screenplay is based on), lots of gore including 
   heads and various body parts being ripped off and a really 
   one-of-a-kind storyline that makes you want to stayed glued to the

   some of the little nuances in the story, such as why the bigfoot 
   didn't kill the main teenager Jack (David Michael O'Neill) when he 
   had the chance in the cabin. This is by far director Emmett Alston's

   the opening shot, where the camera lovingly pans over a variety of 
   firearms and ammo, to the actors' accents, where everyone calls each 
   other &quot;son&quot; or &quot;mam&quot;, you know you are about to

    director/producer/co-scripter Frank Patterson forgot the cardinal 
   rule of horror filmmaking: Cut to the chase and get to the good 
   stuff. Neil Willard (Wiley M. Pickett) and girlfriend Sarah (Leslie 
   Mullin) bring some friends to Neal's family property (who the locals 
   refer to as &quot;The Old Willard Place&quot;) for a weekend hunting 
   trip (This is Texas after all. What else would they do on their 
   weekends?). There have been many unexplained deadly 
   &quot;accidents&quot; on the property in the past, but since Neal is 
   not a superstitious man, he decides to ignore all the warnings and 
   put his friends' lives in jeopardy. It seems the Willard propery use 
   to belong to the local Indians and Neal's ancestors forced them off 
   the land, which made an Indian shaman put a curse on the property. A 
   &quot;Demon Warrior&quot; (Lee Barret) inhabits the property, killing 
   anyone who steps foot on it (Don't try to rationalize it or you'll go 
   crazy). It's not long before the Demon starts killing Neal's friends 
   using various Indian methods (death by stone sacrificial knife, arrow 
   and tomahawk). The sudden appearance of a friendly Indian (Jon 
   Langione) proves beneficial to Neal and Sarah, the only two people in 
   the hunting party still left alive. He explains to the duo that the 
   legend of the land is true and only he can lift the curse. As he 
   performs an ancient ritual his grandfather taught him, the Indian is 
   shot in the chest with an arrow by the Demon. Neal grabs the Indian's 
   bow and shoots an arrow at the Demon, who grabs the arrow in mid-air 
   and disappears in a bolt of lightning. The dying Indian informs Neal 
   and Sarah that the curse is now lifted. Umm......what?!?&nbsp; More 
   silly than scary, <B>DEMON WARRIOR</B> is a lethargically-paced 
   horror film that takes forever to get to the first killing and when 
   it does, the camera pulls away before we see anything. Director Frank 
   Patterson (<B><A HREF="black_snow_1989.htm">BLACK SNOW</A></B> - 
   1989), who co-wrote the script with Mark Baird and Alan Stewart (who 
   directed the Texas-lensed horror western <B><A HREF="ghost_riders_1987.htm">GHOST
    RIDERS</A></B> [1987], on which Frank Patterson was Associate 
   Producer and Music Composer), tries to inject some drama into the 
   tired plot by having Sarah and Neal's best friend Brent (Jerry R. 
   Coiteux) express their love for each other behind Neal's back, but 
   when Brent is killed by the Demon (an arrow in his chest), Neal later 
   tells Sarah while they are sitting around a campfire that he knew 
   about her infidelity, but he wanted to see how it &quot;played 
   out&quot; before he confronted her. I guess the advantage goes to 
   Neal! To further stretch the boundaries of believability, the Indian 
   that arrives to save Neal and Sarah tells them that he is actually a 
   wealthy investment banker! The Demon is basically nothing but 
   bodybuilder Lee Barret dressed in a tiny buckskin loincloth with some 
   horribly lame-assed makeup applied to his face. It is one of the 
   worse monsters that I have ever seen and it sometimes reminded me of 
   the turkey monster in <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Blood Freak">BLOOD FR</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Blood Freak">EAK</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"> 
   (1972). There's also minimal gore (just a couple of arrow impalements 
   and a tomahawk to the head), one of the limpest finales in horror 
   film history (Really, I can't remember when another film left me 
   saying, &quot;Is that it?&quot;) and only one instance of nudity (in 
   the beginning of the film, no less!). The acting is amateurish (try 
   not to laugh when Jerry R. Coiteux is shot with an arrow and says to 
   his friend, &quot;Hassmiler, help me!&quot; in one of the weakest 
   cries for help my ears have ever heard) and the only halfway decent 
   thing about this film is a pretty good car crash/explosion. Faint 
   praise for a totally lackluster regional horror flick. Which just 
   proves that not everything that comes out of Texas is big. Also 
   starring John Garrett, Bruce Carbonara, Vonda Borski, Martin Smith

   of the women, Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) loses her husband and daughter 
   on the trip home in a truly shocking accident (one of the best

    Mountains (actually filmed in Scotland and on film stages in 
   Pinewood Studios, England) to explore some newly discovered cave. 
   Sarah is still not over her loss but decides to go on the trip to get 
   her mind off of it. What they discover down there will leave you 
   gasping for breath, as Sarah and her mates must fight off some 
   human-like blind creatures (their origin is never explained, but they 
   may have been the decendants of some lost explorers who were in the 
   cave 100 years earlier, known as &quot;crawlers&quot; in the end 
   credits), a cave-in, as well as some infighting among themselves. 
   Only we, the viewers, know that Sarah is experiencing flashbacks and 
   hallucinations of her daughter's birthday (we see her blowing out the 
   candles on her cake as a symbolic gesture of giving up), but the real 
   menace (beside the creatures taste for human flesh) is expedition 
   leader Juno (Natalie Mendoza), who is harboring some secrets of her 
   own and commits one of the worst bits of violence in this film. It 
   all ends on a final note of desperation, the only logical conclusion 
   for the film. Now the bad news: <A HREF="http://www.lionsgatefilms.com">Lions
    Gate</A> is releasing the film to theaters in the US devoid of the 
   downbeat ending (they plan on including it as an extra when they 
   release it on DVD). I can think of no better time to buy a multi-region
    DVD player than now. I'm tired of film companies like Lions Gate and <A HREF="http://dimensionfilms.com">Dimension
    Films</A> giving us watered-down tripe so American audiences can 
   walk out of the movie happy. I don't know about you, but I don't mind 
   using my brain while watching films. Back to the movie: Marshall 
   directs with a sure hand with an all-female cast and builds 
   atmosphere by using only available light, greatly enhancing the 
   tension and making you jump at certain sections of the film. The 
   creatures are amazing and move quickly, but the women hold their own 
   against them until they are separated. Soon, scenes of gut-munching 
   (gory, but shot in a way not to give away too much), crossing 
   crevasses to escape the terror and unexpected bits of violence by the 
   women soon follow. Marshall is to be congratulated for making a film 
   about women with grit and character, which makes their deaths all the 
   more shocking. Well done and must viewing for any horror fan. Also 
   starring Alex Reid, Saskia Mulder, MyAnna Buring, Nora-Jane Noone and 
   Molly Kayll. Skip the Lions Gate DVD and get the English DVD from 
   Pathe Distribution, Ltd. (available from <A HREF="http://www.amazon.co.uk">amazon.co.uk</A>).
    <B>Rated R</B>. NOTE: Shauna Macdonald returned in 2009 (I quess the 
   downbeat ending in the original was just a dream) with a DTV sequel 
   called (what else?) <B><A HREF="descent_part_2_2009.htm">THE DESCENT 
   PART 2</A></B>, which is merely a shadow of the original that takes

   unoriginal monster movie with lots of nasty bits of gore thrown in 
   (and the usual shock &quot;surprise&quot; ending that taints most 
   horror films today). You can tell almost immediately that Neil 
   Marshall had nothing to do with it. And neither should you. Watching 
   it ruins the effect you had viewing the first film.</FONT></FONT></P>

   one of the unlikely heroes, helping the two remaining girls kill-off 
   the cannibalistic clan, whose flesh-hunger seems to be caused by some

   slow-going, the film picks up in the second half dramatically as

   generally chopped-up. Buer gives a grating performance in the 
   beginning and you think that he will be one of the early victims.

   Nick is now convinced he killed Sammy (thanks to all the psychotropic 
   drugs pumped into his body), but Dr. Willard (David Gant) wants to 
   discover the truth about what really happened to Sammy, so he has 
   Nick released from the hospital under his care. Dr. Willard plans to 
   write a book about the subject, so he brings Nick back to Blackwater 
   Asylum, along with psychology students Rachel (Elize Du Toit), Brett 
   (Matt Berry) and Dr. Willard's assistant, Melissa (Louise Griffiths). 
   Nick is not too keen on the idea, but since he really has no choice 
   in the matter, he reluctantly agrees and, once they all set foot in 
   Blackwater Asylum, it is plain to see that Nick has a good reason to 
   feel uneasy. Not only is it apparent that some deadly supernatural 
   force possesses the chair, but Nick has to put up with the sarcastic 
   bullying remarks of Brett (who is an asshole of the first degree), 
   the untrusting attitude of Melissa (who believes that Nick is a 
   murderer) and Dr. Willard's ulterior motives (which have to do with 
   the experiments run by the asylum's namesake, Dr. Blackwater, before 
   he went mad and disappeared in 1963). Only Rachel seems sympathetic 
   towards Nick, but he is going to need more than sympathy if he (or 
   anyone else) is going to survive their stay at the asylum. By the 
   time we get to the film's convoluted finale (which makes absolutely 
   no sense if you bother to think about it deeply enough), Nick will 
   face his demons, both imagined and real, while everyone else dies 
   nasty, violent deaths.&nbsp; This English horror film, directed by 
   Adam Mason (<B><A HREF="13th_sign_2000.htm">THE 13TH SIGN</A></B> - 
   2000) and co-written by Mason and Simon Boyes (who both co-directed 
   the much better <B><A HREF="broken_2006.htm">BROKEN</A></B> the same 
   year as this film), suffers greatly because Mason tips the hands of 
   everyone's fates at the beginning of the film. The framing device of 
   Nick narrating the entire film (where he utters the word 
   &quot;cunt&quot; much too often) and showing all the major characters 
   meeting their fates in the opening minutes of the film (even showing 
   the demon, who doesn't come into play until the final third of the 
   film), leaves very little room for surprises, no matter if Nick is 
   insane or not. The decision to give the entire film a bleached-out 
   look (an effect of draining the footage of normal fleshtones and 
   natural colors that is over-used in horror films today and really 
   serves no purpose here) wins no favor with me, either. The only 
   plusses this film has to offer are some gory makeup effects (the 
   mechanics of the chair are very effective, if absurd) and David 
   Gant's over-the-top performance as Dr. Willard, which reminded me of 
   the late Ferdy Mayne (<B><A HREF="fearless_vampire_killers_1967.htm">THE
    FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS</A></B> - 1967; <B><A HREF="#HorrorStar1981">THE
    HORROR STAR</A></B> - 1981). Nick's narration is much too juvenile 
   for the film's own good and, at one point, his narration reveals an 
   utter contempt for the type of audience who would watch this film in 
   the first place. The reveal of Nick's true mental state is not much 
   of a surprise and Andrew Howard (who looks and acts like Jason 
   Statham's hyperactive third cousin) does nothing to make the 
   character the least bit interesting. It's nothing but a cardboard 
   cut-out of a psychotic living in a world of his own making. Also

    wife Ruth (Shelley Morrison), nymphomaniac Lovely (Carolyn Steller), 
   good-girl daughter Julie (Joan McCall) and her good-guy boyfriend 
   Rick (Taylor Lachler), and mentally retarded (and abused) servant 
   Ralph (John Durren). When the kids first enter the home, they are 
   treated as poor helpless tots, but it soon becomes clear that they 
   are way more dangerous than meets the eye. David (Leif Garrett, 
   already an established child star [and future rock star and 
   flameout]) likes to play chess and is a closet transvestite. Hannah 
   (Gail Smale) likes to dress as a nun but is not above using a butcher 
   knife. Moe (Dawn Lyn) likes to play with her doll but likes playing 
   with dead bodies more. Susan (Tia Thompson) likes to play with a 
   lighter and Briann (Tierre Turner) likes to carry a toy rifle and 
   thinks he's in the military. When Ralph is found dead (hanged by a 
   boobytrapped generator) as well as the phone disconnected, the family 
   become suspicious of the kids, and rightly so. Papa Doc's collection 
   of rifles end up missing as does all of the sharp-edged silverware 
   (Rick wryly says to Papa Doc: &quot;I hope you can butter your toast 
   with a spoon.&quot;). Soon they all end up dead thanks to piranhas in 
   the bathtub (!), an ingenious use of a scythe, being soaked with 
   gasoline and set afire, a child-made spear and bear traps capped-off 
   by a throat slashing. The most unusual death comes in the beginning 
   when one of the surviving doctors in the accident tries to warn the 
   people in the house, only to be attacked by the kids with garden and 
   construction tools. The scene turns to black-and-white and 
   slow-motion as the kids stab and whack the doctor with a pitchfork, a 
   sledgehammer, a claw hammer and other instruments until he slowly 
   dies. I was also taken aback that the kids would first target Ralph, 
   the person who would probably cause the least resistance due to his 
   mental state. These kids mean business! Director Sean MacGregor (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#NightmareCounty1971">NIGHTMARE

   in drag; the intense piranha kill sequence) and, surprisingly, no 
   female nudity (but there is a instance of male nudity) to hold your 
   attention throughout, even if the screenplay (by co-star John Durren 
   and Sandra Lee Blowitz) has enough holes to pass a train through.

   OF ALFERD PACKER</A><A NAME="Devoured2005"></A> (2005) -</B> Everyone 
   knows (or should know) the story of Alferd Packer (born Alfred G. 
   &quot;Alferd&quot; Packer in 1842), the first U.S. citizen to be 
   successfully prosecuted for cannibalism when he and a group of 
   frontiersman and women got caught in a heavy snowstorm at Donner's 
   Pass on 1874 and they didn't have enough food to survive, so when 
   members of the party began to die of frostbite and hunger, Packer 
   began to eat them. When he ran out of corpses, he murdered some 
   members of the party and ate them (I hear it tastes like chicken). He 
   did survive, but hid for nine years to avoid the law and was 
   eventually caught, where he was given the death sentence. He 
   eventually won a retrial and was convicted of manslaughter, where he 
   was sentenced to 40 years. he was paroled in 1901 and passed away in 
   1907, where he stipulated in his will that he be eaten (OK, I made up 
   that last part). What I didn't make up is that many people said he 
   became a vegetarian before he died. No matter what is written about 
   Alferd Packer, only he knew the truth and was a true enigma. 
   Scientists have dug up the bodies of his supposed victims and the 
   results have always been inconclusive, but that didn't stop 
   filmmakers from making historical and horror films about his life, 
   some truer than others (This one being reviewed is one of the most 
   outlandish). There was the 1978 TV Movie <B><A HREF="donner_pass_the_road_to_survival_1978.htm">DONNER

   nothing but a modern bloody slasher film. If you like you cannibalism 
   shown in a bloody comical light, there is always Trey Parker and Matt 
   Stone's not-so-biographical Alferd Packer <B><A HREF="cannibal_the_musical_1993.htm">CANNIBAL!
    THE MUSICAL</A></B> (1993), which I would advise everyone to see at 
   least once. In the film that is being reviewed, it is implied that 
   Packer's cannibalism has made him immortal, as long as he keeps 
   eating human flesh. It is also the worst film on the subject. Hell, 
   it is just a bad film. After an absolutely untrue History class on 
   Packer (where the Professor states that he was never known as 
   &quot;Alferd&quot;, making collective historians shake their heads in 
   shame). teaching assistant Aaron (AarinTeich) takes (or rather, 
   makes) a group of college students take a trip to Miller's Pass, 
   California to search for the remains of Packer, who supposedly killed 
   Aaron great-grandfather. Little do they know that Packer is still 
   alive, he has some followers and he swings a pretty mean pickaxe. 
   College student Holly (Hollis Evermon; who bugs her eyes out until 
   they nearly pop out of their sockets) hears a girl (Eileen Papa) 
   screaming in a hole in the ground and she tries to pull her out, but 
   the entire area is full of underground tunnels (this use to be gold 
   mine territory) and Packer (Jeff Muzi) kills the girl while blood 
   squirts all over Holly's face. We then see Packer's mummy-like hand 
   burst out of the ground and Holly scream. Aaron and his group run 
   into a creepy guy (Brian Spellman) with explosives when they are 
   looking for Holly and Mr. Creepy tells the city slickers that they 
   better head for civilization before they become chow. Aaron is a 
   weird man, who makes his students stop and form a circle with their 
   feet touching, because he feels the presence of Packer. We then 
   experience a freak-out scene full of solarized shots, dead rotting 
   miners, and strange double exposures (none of it makes any sense). 
   Tara (Q. Taylor Park) is the first one to wake up, but she can't get 
   anyone else to, so she does the only natural thing that a rational 
   person can do: she heads out into uncharted territory looking for 
   Holly by herself (did she think that none of the other students or 
   Aaron would wake up?). She finds an entrance to a cave and naturally 
   enters it looking for Holly. Meanwhile, the rest of the students and 
   Aaron wake up, so Laura (Mia Lynne) leads the rest on a search party 
   for Tara (who is looking for Holly, who is looking for...). Laura 
   finds the same entrance to the cave that Tara did and they go inside, 
   except for chicken student Curtis (Patrick Todd), who remains 
   outside. We see plenty of P.O.V. shots of an ugly old miner (probably 
   Packer) running through the mine's tunnels and killing Tara with an 
   axe, followed by punching his fist through her chest. Curtis 
   eventually enters the mine and arrives just in time to see Packer 
   chowing-down on Tara's body. Laura locates Packer's living area 
   inside the mine, which contains plenty of strange objects, including 
   hanging bloody burlap bags full of human body parts and a large chest 
   full of chunks of gold. Aaron finally finds the entrance to the mine 
   and goes looking for everyone (I use to find pieces of teacher's 
   assistants in my stool during my college days, because they were 
   usually behind the students when it came to keeping up with the class 
   and Aaron just proves me right). Curtis sees a rat next to a 
   dismembered human finger and he is killed in a giant mouse trap, when 
   he steps on the triggering device and is impaled on the spikes that 
   spring down on him (All of these students seem a little light in the 
   head). Packer has Laura gagged and chained with her arms 
   outstretched, while he stands behind her and looks to be doing 
   something very painful to her. Aaron hears Laura's screams, but 
   Packer knocks him out with an axe handle. He wakes up on a locked 
   room with Tara (but how is that possible?), while we watch Packer 
   boil some flesh off of human bones. Aaron and Tara (Wasn't she just 
   seen killed a few minutes ago?) walk through a gauntlet of human 
   bodies and body parts and then see a young naked couple making love 
   (WTF?!?) in a mine tunnel. Aaron and Tara see it and just walk away 
   without giving the couple a warning. Seems there are a whole pack of 
   dishelveled old followers of Packer and they go after the couple 
   making love. After the girl is killed, the guy is chased through a 
   tunnel and is run over by a huge round boulder (Hmm... I wonder where 
   they got that idea?). We watch Packer pickaxe a young girl to death 
   and then eat her foot. It seems the mine is some type of 
   out-of-the-way tourist attraction that keeps Packer alive by 
   supplying him with human bodies to eat, but some of these 
   &quot;tourists&quot; are cannibals, too! Tara escapes the room that 
   she, Aaron and the cannibal couple are in (no, none of this makes any 
   sense!), while Packer kills a cannibal girl with a pickaxe. Tara is 
   captured once again (After coming back to life. I mean, there's 
   suspension of belief and then there's just plain stupidity.) and is 
   about to be incinerated by being tied to a railway car heading for a 
   tunnel of fire, but Aaron saves her ass (but not before thinking 
   whether he could get away with a few bags of gold instead). Packer 
   does such things as bang a drum and a gong and ring a large bell to 
   alert all the other cannibals that there are intruders. As Aaron and 
   Tara light a fuse to some dynamite, Aaron hears Holly's voice, but 
   she is quite mad and almost kills the couple before they break free 
   and the tunnels explode. Aaron and Tara get a lift on the back of a 
   pickup truck (Why, did Aaron's SUV explode?) back to Los Angeles. The 
   last shot shows Packer and his pickaxe looking at the city from a 
   nearby mountain. It looks like Packer will have more than his share 
   of human food.&nbsp; This film is maddening to the extreme. Not only 
   does director/co-producer/co-writer Kevin Rapp (<B><A HREF="reflex_action_2002.htm">REFLEX
    ACTION</A></B> - 2002) get every single fact about Packer wrong, the 
   continuity and supposed deaths are a complete mess. As a matter of 
   fact, this film didn't have to be about Packer at all, but any 
   cannibal (films are full of many of them, including Wes Craven's <B><A HREF="hills_have_eyes_1977.htm">THE
    HILLS HAVE EYES</A></B> [1977] and the <B><A HREF="wrong_turn_series_2003-2014.htm">WRONG
    TURN</A></B> franchise [2003 - 2014]), so why make a film about 
   Alferd Packer and fill it with outright lies? 80% of the film is 
   nothing but shots of people running up and down the mine tunnels and, 
   besides a few good makeup and gore effects, the film is boring as 
   hell. The editing is worse than poor and full of inconsistencies (but 
   in the editor's [co-writer/co-producer Mark Workman] defense, Rapp 
   probably didn't give him enough to work with to make a coherent 
   film). Considering that Kevin Rapp hasn't directed a film since this 
   one seems to back up my claims. Do yourself a favor and just say no 
   to this film. Eat your own arm instead. Also starring Evelyn Brewton, 
   Fred Kerpsie, Cynthia Margol, Jeff Salsworth, Rita Branch, Tim 
   Scanlon and Erica Rapp. A <A HREF="http://www.troma.com">Troma Team Video</A>

   and, finally, a run-in with some nasty National Guardsmen. The crew 
   finally settle-in at the isolated mansion of actor Ridley's (Phillip 
   Riccio) rich parents. The mansion has security cameras in every room 
   and Debra notices that Ridley is acting weird (Was the first clue 
   that he's still in his mummy costume?). It turns out he's been bitten 
   and turns into a zombie, shuffling around the mansion in his mummy 
   costume, biting Jason and forcing Debra to finish Jason's film on her 
   own and warn the world that in order for us to defeat the zombies, we 
   first must learn to treat each other as &quot;human&quot; beings and 
   not as disposable &quot;product&quot;. Debra concludes the film by 
   asking, &quot;Are we worth saving? You tell me.&quot; as we watch 
   footage of two hunters shooting tied-up zombies for kicks.&nbsp; This 
   is a low-budget, but highly effective horror film that, thankfully, 
   doesn't induce the same &quot;shakey-cam&quot; queasiness or 
   headache-inducing effect as <B><A HREF="blair_witch_project_1999.htm">THE
    BLAIR WITCH PROJECT</A></B> (1999) or <B><A HREF="cloverfield_2007.htm">CLOVERFIELD</A></B> 
   (2007) did, even if it uses the same &quot;found footage&quot; 
   premise as those films. George Romero is much more crafty here, using 
   a mixture of handheld cameras, including regular retail video 
   cameras, professional digital video cameras and even camera phones, 
   with fixed cameras, such as the mansion's security cameras, and even 
   YouTube, to tell his tale. First and foremost, this is a horror film, 
   but it is also a parable about modern society's need to catch 
   everything on camera, as if to say, &quot;If it's not documented on 
   video, it can't be very important.&quot; We are a culture of video on 
   demand (thanks to the internet) and our constant desire to view 
   everything immediately or when it suits us comes with dire 
   consequences. The character of Jason Creed represents that need. As 
   his friends and colleagues fall victim to the zombie horde, not once 
   does he put the camera down and offer help. Instead, he rolls tape, 
   callously catching footage of his friends dying or shooting zombified 
   friends in the head. He becomes an extension of the camera, as he 
   inoculates himself from all human emotions, proving to be just as 
   hungry as the zombies, except his hunger is for the &quot;perfect 
   shot&quot;. Only Debra seems to understand the gravity of the 
   situation and <B><A HREF="diary_of_the_dead_2007b.htm">DIARY OF THE DEAD</A></B> 
   is actually her document of the entire affair. She edits all of 
   Jason's footage, along with TV news clips and other people's home 
   video footage (including a child's birthday that turns nasty when the 
   hired clown turns out to be a zombie), to form a cautionary tale 
   warning any potential survivors in the world that the living may be 
   more dangerous than the living dead. If this film has a fault, it's 
   that Romero augments the practical gore effects with way too much CGI 
   enhancement, which is a disappointment since Romero and practical 
   effects use to go hand-in-hand. Too many of the gore effects (and 
   there are many) have noticeable CGI help, including the deaf Amish 
   guy's death by scythe and a lot of CGI blood, which gives the deaths 
   a fake, plastic feel. Still I admire the new direction Romero has 
   taken the series, offering an up-to-date revision of his ground 
   breaking 1968 classic. Low in budget, but not low in imagination. 
   Many genre directors, including Wes Craven, Guillermo del Toro, 
   Stephen King and Quentin Tarantino, put in voice cameos as TV 
   newsreaders. Also starring Shawn Roberts, Amy Lalonde, Joe Dinicol,

   - 1972) is a noted researcher who is working on a serum that will 
   regenerate dead liver cells, thereby curing deadly liver diseases 
   (one which killed his mother). While treating prostitute Linda Monte 
   (Marie O'Henry) on one of her weekly hospital visits (she has a minor 
   liver disease), Dr. Pride is chastised by Linda for acting too &quot;white&quot;<A HREF="dr_black_mr_hyde_1975.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dr. black mr. hyde poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   and she tells him to loosen up a little. Little do they both know 
   that what she said will come all too true. When Dr. Pride injects one 
   of his mice (a white one) with the newest version of his serum, it 
   becomes agressive, bites Dr. Pride and then kills all the other rats 
   (all black) in it's cage. After seeing the results of his latest 
   experiment, Dr. Pride decides he needs a &quot;human factor&quot;, so 
   he injects a terminally ill elderly black woman in the hospital with 
   his serum, turning her into a homicidal albino (!), who attacks a 
   nurse and then dies. Dr. Pride's lab assistant/wannabe lover, Dr. 
   Billie Worth (Rosalind Cash), makes a remark that maybe the old 
   woman's heart was too weak, so, like all mad doctors, Dr. Pride 
   injects himself with the serum, transforming him into a superhuman 
   murderous honky (!), Mr. Hyde (his alter ego's name is never 
   mentioned once in the film, though). Mr. Hyde hops into his Rolls 
   Royce and goes looking for Linda, stopping long enough to beat the 
   crap out of three black thugs who try to rob him. Linda has problems 
   of her own, as her ex-pimp Silky (Stu Gilliam) tries to talk her into 
   working for scumbag drug dealer Preston (Marc Alaimo). When Mr. Hyde 
   finds Linda at her nightclub hangout, a huge fight breaks out and Mr. 
   Hyde throws everyone (including Silky) around like ragdolls until 
   Silky cuts him with a switchblade and a few minutes later he turns 
   back into Dr. Pride (and no one recognizes him!). Dr. Pride brings 
   Linda back to his house and tries to inject her with the serum but, 
   when Dr. Pride injects himself with the serum (to prove it's 
   harmless) and turns into Mr. Hyde, Linda runs away. Suddenly, there 
   are a series of prostitute murders in the area and the cops assigned 
   to the case, Lt. Jackson (the late Ji-Tu Cumbuka; <B><A HREF="mandingo_1975.htm">MANDINGO</A></B> 
   - 1975) and Lt. O'Connor (Milt Kogan), try to find out who is behind 
   the killings and put an end to the bloodshed. They get help from 
   Linda, who tells the cops the whole story. At first they don't 
   believe her, but Lt. Jackson decides to check it out. After 
   interviewing Dr. Worth, Lt. Jackson becomes convinced that Linda is 
   telling the truth. Dr. Pride is no longer able to separate himself 
   from his alter ego, so he hunts down Linda and is killed in a hail of 
   police gunfire.&nbsp; This is one of the last horror blaxploitation 
   flicks to get a theatrical release and, since it was directed by 
   William Crain, who kick-started the genre with <B><A HREF="blacula_1972.htm">BLACULA</A></B>

    it's merits. It's not as well-made and acted as <B>BLACULA</B> 
   (Ji-Tu Cumbuka is pretty mediocre here and star Bernie Casey looks to 
   be sleepwalking through his role), but the screenplay (by Larry 
   LeBron) has a lot of comical, as well as serious, touches. My 
   favorite scene is when Mr. Hyde chases Silky down in his Rolls Royce 
   and pins him against the wall. As Mr. Hyde puts his car into reverse 
   for one more hit on the seriously-injured pimp, Silky pulls out his 
   switchblade in defiance, as if a sliver of metal could stop a ton of 
   charging steel. Even though I can sympathize with Dr. Pride's 
   motivation for developing the serum (He delivers an impassioned 
   speech about his mother's sad life to Linda while they are in his 
   car.), I have to say that the way he goes about achieving those goals 
   doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense. I can see his interest in 
   Linda, since she suffers from liver disease, but why the hell would 
   he inject himself when he's healthy as an ox? My favorite bit of 
   dialogue comes when Lt. Jackson tells his partner that they are 
   probably dealing with a &quot;haint&quot;. Lt. O'Connor turns to him 
   and says, &quot;What the fuck is a haint?&quot; Jackson replies, 
   &quot;That's a cross between the Abominable Snowman and Willie the 
   Werewolf!&quot; Although the film's not very bloody, it is violent 
   and the scene where Mr. Hyde kills a police dog and tosses it's 
   lifeless body in front of a shocked crowd of cops is very well done. 
   The finale takes place on the world-famous Watts Towers in California 
   and the film was later retitled <B><A HREF="watts_monster_1975.htm">THE
    WATTS MONSTER</A></B> to capitalize on it. Bernie Casey's 
   transformation into Mr. Hyde (makeup by Stan Winston) is quite 
   simple: Just pancake makeup on his face and arms (with an undersized 
   jacket on his torso, the sleeves rolled up to his elbows), a 
   salt-and-pepper afro and white contact lenses. Not very convincing or 
   frightening, but it is unintentionally funny. Rosalind Cash (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Death Spa">DEATH

    IMMORTALIZER</A></B> - 1989), with 99.9% of them failing miserably 
   This is one of those films, especially after I saw &quot;Vista Street

   turning out quality entertainment. As a matter of fact, this company 
   has failed to release anything remotely watchable. <B>1909: The Dawn 
   Of Modern Medical Science:</B> Dr. Elliot Hackenstein (David Muir; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NeonManiacs1985">NEON
    MANIACS</A></B> - 1985) is using his new serum and plenty of 
   electricity on a dead baby piglet to try and bring it back to life 
   (One of the few instances that the filmmakers got correct; the pig 
   has the closest blood and respiratory systems to humans. Pig hearts 
   are sometimes used for<A HREF="dr_hackenstein_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dr. hackenstein vhs front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="281" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   temporary transplants until a suitable human donor can be found.). He 
   hopes it works because his beloved wife was in an accident and he was 
   only able to save her head, which he keeps alive by having it 
   hooked-up to electronic apparatus in his laboratory. He must find 
   fresh pieces of the female anatomy to stitch his wife back together 
   and use his serum on. Turns out his serum does work, as the bloody 
   baby piglet does come back to life (a very cheap effect). After being 
   shown various Pyrex glassware in different food-colored water and 
   bubbling dry ice during the opening credits (an anachronism, because 
   Pyrex [you can plainly see their logo] wasn't introduced until 1915) 
   to show us how serious a scientist Elliot is, Dean Slesinger (Michael 
   Ensign) is seen having dinner with Elliot and wants to know when he 
   will move his experiments to the college for the students to see. It 
   is a teaching college, after all (But aren't all colleges?). Elliot's 
   mute and deaf servant, Yolanda (Catherine Cahn), holds up a series of 
   cards asking Dean Slesinger if he wants cream or sugar in his coffee 
   (This is as high as the humor goes, so just be prepared). Elliot 
   tells the Dean that he has found a way to bring life back to the 
   lifeless, but the Dean thought Elliot gave up on this three years 
   ago, when his wife was killed in the accident. Elliot takes the Dean 
   to his laboratoty, where he shows him the living dismembered head of 
   his wife (Elliot's wife Sheila [Sylvia Lee Baker] was killed by the 
   spinning blades of the Lusitania during her maiden yoyage in 1906 
   [which was true; the maiden voyage, not the head]) and how he plans 
   on finding female body parts to reassemble her. The Dean is horrified 
   (he was in the maiden voyage of the Lusitania and doesn't remember 
   Elliot or Sheila being there or there ever being an accident), so he 
   accuses Elliot of murdering his own wife with his new serum, to which 
   Elliot replies, &quot;Ridiculous! Things just got out of hand!&quot; 
   The Dean recommends that Elliot no longer comes to the college 
   because as of now he has lost all teaching privileges. Elliot gives 
   the Dean a fatal heart attack when he shows him some of his revived 
   critters, as the head of Sheila moans, &quot;Elliot, I have such a 
   bad headache. Will you get me an aspirin?&quot; (We're only 10 
   minutes into the film and already I can't wait for it to end.). Three 
   young women and a&nbsp; man, snooty rich sisters Leslie (Catherine 
   Davis Cox) and Wendy (Denise DeRosario), brother Alex (John Alexis) 
   and good girl niece Melanie Victor (Stacey Travis) are driving a car 
   (This looks to be a late 1920's model), when they get into an 
   accident near Elliot's home (I mean, what are the chances?) They drag 
   Alex to Elliot's house because he has a broken leg. Elliot fixes up 
   Alex's leg the best he can and invites them to spend the night, even 
   though Leslie and Wendy bust Elliot's balls every chance they get. 
   They are real bitches. Elliot is then paid a visit by the local 
   graverobbers, the Rhodes (The late Logan and Anne Ramsey), who 
   deliver Elliot a man's corpse. He tells them that he needs the fresh 
   corpses of three young women, when it hits him that he has exactly 
   that in his home right now. He pays off the Rhodes and begins to look 
   at the three women in his home as body parts rather than women, while 
   Alex watches his sisters and Melanie undress in their bedroom, but 
   Wendy puts an end to it by jamming a lit cigarette through the door's 
   keyhole and burns Alex in the eye. The threesome's snooty mother, 
   Mrs. Trilling (Phyllis Diller), goes to Detective Olin (William 
   Schreiner) about the disappearances of her three children and her 
   niece, but this is the first the Detective or Officer Robbins (Jeff 
   Rector) have heard about it. Mrs. Trilling wants her children found 
   immediately, but says if they don't find her niece, it's no big deal. 
   Meanwhile, Elliot is grabbing the girls one-by-one, beginning with 
   Wendy, and saws off the parts he needs (He says to Wendy, 
   &quot;Please, I'm not going to kill you!), while Leslie sees her 
   sister's body parts in a freezer. He begins to make his nude female 
   Frankenstein monster (complete with panties!) while Detective Olin 
   interrogates the captured Rhodes. They are quick to give up Elliot, 
   so the Detective heads out to Elliot's house in his very slow car. 
   Elliot invites Melanie Victor into his labotatory and she tells him 
   her life story about being treated like dirt by an uncaring family. 
   Elliot begins to actually fall in love with Melanie, but Alex acts 
   like a third wheel, saying that Melanie loves him instead (Elliot was 
   going to use Melanie's eyes to put in his wife's eye sockets) and 
   Melanie runs out of the lab embarassed. Alex snoops around the house 
   and discovers Elliot's journals on human re-animation. He also finds 
   a pistol. Alex finds the Dean in a bedroom, where it turns out the 
   Dean is not so dead, so Elliot keeps on investigating the mansion, 
   while Elliot treats the Dean. Alex discovers Elliot treating the 
   stitched-together corpse, so Elliot grabs <A HREF="dr_hackenstein_troma_dvd_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dr. hackenstein dvd9 front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="191" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>him
    and gives him a tranquilizer shot. Detective Olin finally makes it 
   to Elliot's house and Elliot asks Melanie to act as nurse to both 
   Alex and the Dean (who was injected with the serum). Melanie 
   eventually finds out the truth about Elliot and it takes forever for 
   the Detective to park the car and walk to the house, but no one 
   answers the door (Yolanda is deaf). Elliot changes his mind and tells 
   Melanie he is going to use her eyes for his wife's corpse. Yolanda 
   sees the stitched-together corpse (she had no idea what Elliot was 
   doing) and finally answers the door, but since she has no cards to 
   express what she has just seen, she has to do it in pantomime. 
   Detective Olin hears Melanie scream, making all of Yolanda's hard 
   pantomime work useless. Detective Olin shoots the locked door of the 
   laboratory, but Elliot knocks him out with a blow to the head with a 
   pipe. Elliot advances towards Melanie with a dagger, but finds 
   himself unable to kill her (He screams out, &quot;I am in 
   Hell!&quot;). Detective Olin gives Elliot a hypodermic shot and he 
   falls on the dagger, but they all see the naked (but still wearing 
   panties), eyeless Sheila rise from the operating table complaining 
   about the body parts Elliot picked out for her. She turns out to be a 
   bitch of the highest order (Is it any wonder that Elliot may have 
   murdered her in the first place?). In the finale, both Leslie and 
   Wendy are found alive, but the body parts he took have been replaced 
   with hairy male body parts (He did say that he wasn't going to kill 
   them.). Elliot (who was given a shot of the serum by Detective Olin) 
   jumps off the house's top floor outside balcony and chases after an 
   escaping Sheila. The film concludes with unfunny future lives of the 
   film's characters, like Yolanda becoming a famous silent film star 
   and Leslie and Wendy becoming circus freaks.&nbsp; This SOV effort is 
   simply terrible, except for the far too few special makeup effects 
   from the KNB Effects Group and some nudity.The only really funny part 
   of the film is how long it takes the Detective to travel from his 
   station to Elliot's house. It would have taken less time if he 
   walked, but the rest of the film, not surprisingly the only 
   directorial and screenwriting effort by Richard Clark, is about as 
   funny as watching a baby die while it's on fire. The print on the 
   Troma DVD is in fullscreen (just like the <A HREF="forum_home_video_vhs_covers.htm">Forum
    Home Video</A> VHS tape that came before it) and, if you thought the 
   film was unfunny, wait until you get a gander at a facially bandaged 
   Lloyd Kaufman's opening (something he does on nearly every Troma DVD, 
   just without the bandages) where he turns out to be a dickhead puppet 
   (talk about truth in advertising!). If you look in the background, 
   you will see a photo of Michael Jackson with the 
   &quot;N.A.M.B.L.A.&quot; logo below it, an O.J. Simpson photo with 
   the word &quot;GUILTY&quot; below it or various video inserts of 
   Troma interns, both male and female, full-frontal naked. It makes the 
   film look like a masterpiece in comparison. This film was dedicated 
   to Anne Ramsey, who passed away in 1988. Unfortunately, this was one 
   of her very last films. There are no other actors to list in this 
   film, because, like the budget, the acting staff was threadbare. A <A HREF="http://www.troma.com">Troma

    JEKYLL AND THE WOLFMAN</A><A NAME="Dr. Jekyll Wolfman"></A> (1971) -</B> 
   English newlyweds Imre and Justine decide to spend their honeymoon in 
   Imre's home town of Baliavasta, located in Transylvania. While 
   visiting the gravesite of his parents, Imre is attacked and killed by 
   three brothers robbing his car. Justine is nearly raped by the three 
   when Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy) steps in, kills two of them and 
   saves her. He brings Justine back to his castle and looks after her, 
   along with an old witch who also lives there. The surviving brother 
   vows revenge and brings two friends to the castle looking to rob 
   Waldemar, then kill him. Too bad they decided to do this during a 
   full moon. Waldemar turns into a werewolf and kills the two friends, 
   but the surviving brother escapes again. Waldemar opens up to Justine 
   about his affliction when she sees him turn into a<A HREF="dr_jekyll_and_the_wolfman_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dr. jekyll and the werewolf poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   werewolf from her bedroom window. The brother kills the witch woman 
   (he cuts her head off and parades it around on a stick) and gets the 
   townpeople to storm the castle. Justine and Waldemar escape and 
   Justine brings him back to London. Justine goes to her good friend 
   Dr. Henry Jekyll (Jack Taylor) and asks him to try to help Waldemar 
   find a cure for his condition. Skeptical at first, Dr. Jekyll invites 
   Waldemar to come to his office for tests. Waldemar gets accidentally 
   stuck in an elevator on the way to Jekyll's office and turns into a 
   werewolf, slaughters the nurse trapped in there with him and 
   eventually escapes, beginning a reign of terror the newspapers are 
   calling &quot;Worse than Jack The Ripper&quot;. Dr. Jekyll uses an 
   altered version of the serum his grandfather invented on Waldemar and 
   turns him into Mr. Hyde who, with the help of Jekyll's jealous female 
   assistant Sandra, escapes and begins his psychopathic urge to kill 
   women, eventually turning his attention toward Justine. Can Waldemar 
   fight off both his Mr. Hyde and werewolf personalities and find true 
   love with Justine? You just know this will all turn out badly.&nbsp; 
   This is the sixth in the series of the exploits of Waldemar Daninsky 
   and it is probably the tamest, until the final third, that is. 
   Directed by Leon Klimovsky, who directed Naschy in <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Werewolf Shadow">WEREWOLF
    SHADOW</A></B> (1970), one of the better Daninsky sagas, he keeps 
   the nudity and most of the gruesomeness to a minimum until the final 
   30 minutes, when it really kicks into gear. Mr. Hyde's rape and 
   eventual flogging of Justine certainly will wake you up if you were 
   losing interest. Naschy chews up his role of Mr. Hyde, walking the 
   streets of modern London in his overcoat, ascot, hat and cane (with 
   hidden sword), picking up prostitutes and killing them. He even 
   tosses one unlucky lad into the Thames for a final swim. This is 
   probably the most dated of the Daninsky flicks as he invades a mod 
   discoteque (complete with go-go dancers) as Mr. Hyde, changes back to 
   Waldemar Daninsky and then promptly turns into a werewolf in front of 
   all the disco patrons' frightened eyes. If this film has one problem, 
   it's that the Mr. Hyde angle is never satisfactorily concluded. Once 
   he changes from Mr. Hyde back to the werewolf, the Hyde story is 
   dropped as Daninsky bites Justine and, just before she kicks off, she 
   pumps a couple of silver bullets into his chest and they die 
   side-by-side. The bloodletting is sparse, limited to a head being 
   crushed with a rock, a couple of torn throats (with pieces of bloody 
   meat hanging from Naschy's mouth), an off-screen beheading, a couple 
   of stabbings and Justine's topless flogging. This is a minor chapter 
   in the Daninsky saga, but it does have it's good moments, enough to 
   keep you entertained for 90 minutes. As with all the Daninsky films, 
   this was written by Naschy using his real name, Jacinto Molina. Also

    and hotshot new college professor Michael Fitzgerald (George Wyner; <B><A HREF="spaceballs_1987.htm">SPACEBALLS</A></B> 
   - 1987) try to figure out what is causing all these deaths, but it is 
   obvious to the viewer early on that normally harmless domesticated 
   dogs are responsible, as they seem to pack together at night with the 
   singular purpose of ripping apart anything that crosses their path. 
   What Harlan and Michael find so strange is that while the attacks are 
   savage, none of the corpses seem to have been eaten, like the animals 
   are killing not from hunger, but for the sake of killing. It's not 
   long before our two heroes trace the cause of the attacks to the 
   government facility and their extremely huge particle accelerator 
   experiments, but they have a hard time convincing the powers-that-be 
   of their concerns. That all changes when the canines at a local dog 
   show break their leashes and attack their masters, but instead of 
   listening to Harlan's advice of going home and locking their doors, 
   some of the macho men form a hunting party, which leads to a mass dog 
   attack where all those involved are savagely mauled to death. The 
   dogs take over the town, attacking and slaughtering everyone they 
   come in contact with. The dogs then turn their attention to the 
   college campus, trapping all the students and faculty at the campus 
   library, which leads to the deaths of nearly every person trapped 
   there. Harlan and his girlfriend, Caroline (Sandra McCabe), flee the 
   town and see nothing but death in their wake (including Michael's 
   chewed-up body). The closing shot shows that's it's not just Fido 
   that is now infected (Meow!).&nbsp; <B><A HREF="dogs_1976b.htm">DOGS</A></B>

   so it should come as no surprise that this has the look and feel of a 
   70's Movie of the Week (As far as I can discern, Brinckerhoff has 
   only one other non-TV credit in his extensive career, 1978's <B><A HREF="acapulco_gold_1978.htm">ACAPULCO

   domesticated dogs turn nasty, and in order to pull it off on-screen, 
   you have to make normally harmless-looking dogs seem deadly. While it 
   may be easy to make Dobermans, German Shepherds and other larger 
   canines look threatening, the trick is to make poodles, Jack terriers 
   and other smaller dogs look the same way. That's where <B><A HREF="dogs_1976c.htm">DOGS</A></B> 
   falls short. It's hard to take some of the attack scenes here 
   seriously, especially when the little nippers are wagging their tails 
   and look as happy as when they lick peanut butter off their trainer's 
   private parts. Brinckerhoff doesn't hold back on the blood and shows 
   the effects of the dog attacks in great detail (the attack on the 
   campus library is very bloody), not to mention the scene of Michael 
   accidentally shooting and killing a man when he is trying to shoot a 
   dog, but most of the film is flat and bland. David McCallum 
   sleepwalks through his role and Sandra McCabe is extremely bad in her 
   debut film performance (She is one of the worst screamers in film 
   history and had a very short acting career). I did like how 
   excellent, unsung character actor George Wyner, who usually has small 
   roles on TV and in films, is given the chance to shine here in one of

    OF HELL</A><A NAME="Dogs Of Hell"></A> (1982) -</B> This is regional 
   producer/star Earl Owensby's stab at the 3-D revival craze of the 
   early 80's and, since it's his most violent and bloody film, it's 
   also one of his best (in the realm of low-budget moviemaking, that's 
   still not saying much). The government uses a commercial big rig to 
   transport a pack of genetically altered rottweilers (bred to be the 
   military's newest weapon) to a military laboratory in Fort Bragg. The 
   truck crashes not too far from the summer resort town of Lake Lure in 
   North Carolina, spilling it's cargo, setting the killer canines free 
   to roam the countryside. The dogs attack and kill a group of models 
   and a photographer camped out on a photo shoot. Lake Lure's sheriff, 
   Hank Willis (Owensby), biggest problems used to be breaking up fights 
   at the local bar's female mud wrestling contests or fining people for 
   fishing without a license, but when local residents start turning up 
   savagely torn to pieces, Sheriff Willis at first <A HREF="dogs_of_hell_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dogs of hell vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="227" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>thinks
    he's dealing with a rogue cougar or a &quot;knife-weilding psycho 
   with sharp teeth&quot; (um, what?). Compounding his problems are the 
   government, who are being led on a wild goose chase by the head 
   scientist in charge of the project, Dr. Fletcher (Bill Gribble), who 
   wants to save his dogs and Sheriff Willis' rebellous son Ben (Mike 
   Craig), who has been ignoring his father's commands as of late. Dr. 
   Fletcher comes to town and offers his assistance to the sheriff, 
   saying he never intended the dogs to be used as weapons. He has a 
   device that makes the dogs docile and wants to capture the dogs 
   alive, even if it means a few innocent people die in the process. 
   Sheriff Willis forms a hunting party and head to a religious retreat 
   that the local reverend is holding in the woods. They are able to 
   kill one of the dogs, but not before they sink their teeth into a few 
   people. When the dogs finally reach town and kill one of Sheriff 
   Willis' closest friends (he responds by shooting the jaw off of one 
   dog with a revolver that would make Dirty Harry proud), he gathers 
   all the locals and tourists in the hunting lodge for a last stand 
   against the dogs. He must also contend with the dastardly Dr. 
   Fletcher, a raging fire in the lodge and his son, who is trapped in 
   the attic with other people and the dogs close behind.&nbsp; Owensby 
   proves once again that he's a better producer than an actor. When he 
   opens his mouth, the words don't matter, because his delivery is 
   always the same: A monotone reading so wooden, you'll swear cedar 
   chips fall out of his mouth every time he opens it. Owensby, who 
   prided himself in making wholesome family films, definitely didn't 
   follow that rule here, as the blood flows rather freely and the gore 
   is graphic (but quick). People are torn apart, there's gaping wounds 
   that spurt blood and when the dogs are shot, they don't just bleed, 
   they explode. Many of the 3-D effects are incidental rather than 
   integral to the plot (except in the finale) and consist of a pointer 
   and darts thrust or thrown directly at the camera, some forced 
   perspective shots and people and dogs crashing through windows. The 
   dog attacks are handled pretty well, as the rottweilers actually look 
   threatening and the aftermath is pretty gruesome. Owensby, who got 
   his start with <B><A HREF="action.htm#Challenge 1973">CHALLENGE</A></B> 
   (1973) and appeared in nearly all his productions, fancies himself a 
   low-budget John Wayne and even quotes one of the Duke's most famous 
   lines when he decks a drunk at the mud wrestling match. Director 
   Worth Keeter worked steadily on many of Owensby's films, including 
   directing him in the only other Owensby horror film, <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Wolfman1979">WOLFMAN</A></B> 
   (1979).&nbsp; Even though very few of Owensby's films ever played 
   theatrically above the Bible Belt, they were popular enough to make 
   Owensby millions (estimates say he made about $70 million!) and home 
   video opened up a whole new fan base for him. <B><A HREF="dogs_of_hell_1982c.htm">DOGS

   compulsion for fire. When he was a child and did anything wrong, his 
   mother would put his arms over the lit stove and burn the 
   &quot;evil&quot; out of him (Mom considers him evil because she got 
   pregnant from a man who did not bother to stick around). Mother may 
   be dead, but she isn't in Donny's mind. In true <B><A HREF="psycho_1960.htm">PSYCHO</A></B> 
   (1960) fashion, she haunts him, both in body and in words. Still, 
   Donny prefers to celebrate, first by playing his record albums loud 
   (mother would never allow this) and then by covering a room in the 
   house from floor to ceiling in sheet metal. But Why? Since everyone 
   who loves horror films already knows the answer, let me just say that 
   Donny has a fiery personality that will eventually be the death of him.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Donny drives to a flower shop at closing time under the guise that 
   he is picking up a bouquet for his sick mother . At first the 
   florist, Kathy Jordan (Johanna Brushay), does not want to let him in 
   because it is after closing time, but Donny is persistent, so she 
   relents and lets him in ($4.50 for a bouquet of flowers? Only in the 
   late-'70s folks!). When Kathy misses her bus home, Donny offers her a 
   ride in his beat up pickup truck, but only if he can stop at home 
   first. Kathy agrees and he manages to talk her in to coming inside 
   the house to meet his mother (like I said, he is persistent!). Once 
   inside the house, Kathy gets a bad feeling and Donny knocks her out 
   before she has a chance to leave. She wakes up totally nude (We see 
   everything. I don't remember seeing the full monty when I saw this 
   film in a theater.), hanging by her hands in the middle of the 
   metal-encased room. Enter Donny in an asbestos fireproof suit holding 
   a flame-thrower. He pours gasoline over Kathy's nude body, fires-up 
   the flame-thrower and burns the poor girl to death, her screams 
   bringing a smile to Donny's face. We know that this pleases Donny 
   because he does it two more times (offscreen), first to a woman whose 
   car has broken down and then to a woman he picks up in a supermarket. 
   He burns them beyond recognition, dresses them in his mother's 
   clothes and poses them in another room upstairs, where he begins to 
   talk to them, telling the burned corpses about how he was punished 
   for being evil by his mother and how all women are no good (He 
   imagines one of the women laughing at him, so he slaps the corpse 
   about the face).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Donny has a bigger problem: He thinks his mother is still alive and 
   taunting him. He is suffering from a guilty conscience (He has a 
   nightmare where all of his victims drag him into a mass grave), so he 
   goes to Church (Catholic guilt at its finest!). Donny asks Father 
   Gerritty (Ralph D. Bowman) if he believes in the Devil and evil and 
   the good Father answers back that he believes that evil walks the 
   Earth, but he doesn't believe in the typical devil, with horns and a 
   trident. Donny doesn't like the answer he gets, so he shows Father 
   Gerrity the burn scars on his arms and explains that his mother did 
   it to him when he was a child (and possibly when he was an adult), 
   saying she was burning the &quot;evil&quot; out of him. Just like 
   most religions, Father Gerritty tells Donny that he must forgive his 
   mother (Could you? I sure as hell couldn't!). Donny goes home, holds 
   his mother's burned hands (Yes, he toasted his mother's dead body, 
   too!) and forgives her. The thing is, Mother doesn't forgive Donny 
   and she taunts him relentlessly.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Donny calls his only friend, married co-worker Bobby Tuttle (Robert 
   Osth, real name: Robert Carnegie; <B><A HREF="mothers_day_1980.htm">MOTHER'S
    DAY</A></B> - 1980) and asks him if he wants to go to the movies 
   (Donny is trying to bring some normalcy back into his life). Bobby 
   talks Donny into meeting him at a disco that night because he has two 
   hot girls ready to party (Did I mention that Bobby was married with 
   children?). Donny reluctantly agrees and goes to a department store 
   to pick up some new clothes (the obviously gay clerk talks him into 
   buying the most expensive disco suit). Donny arrives at the disco and 
   Bobby sets him up with one of the girls, Karen (Kim Roberts). When 
   Karen pulls at his hands to get Donny on the dance floor, his arms 
   are over a lit candle on the table (Uh-oh!!!). Danny has a flashback 
   of his mother putting his arms over the lit stove, so he picks up the 
   candle and smashes it over Karen's head, setting her hair on fire. 
   Donny makes a hasty retreat out of the disco, only to get beaten up 
   by Karen's brother (&quot;You scarred her for life!&quot;). Donny 
   escapes to his truck and turns a bad situation to his advantage, as 
   he picks up two drunk girls and brings them home (He explains to the 
   girls that his face is bloody because he just got jumped, but since 
   he was a Marine and a Green Beret, he beat them up instead. When one 
   of the girls says &quot;I thought the Green Beret was the Army, not 
   the Marines&quot;, Donny replies, &quot;Well, it was a secret 
   division of the Marines!&quot;).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Meanwhile, Bobby goes to Father Gerritty and tells him what Donny 
   just did. They hop into Bobby's station wagon and head for Donny's 
   house. They rescue the two girls just before they become burgers, but 
   Father Gerrity is on the receiving end of the flame-thrower and he 
   runs out of the house on fire, where Bobby puts out the flames with 
   his jacket (He going to have to do a lot of explaining to his wife!). 
   Donny then imagines that all of his victims are walking towards him 
   saying, &quot;We hate you. We always hated you. We won't forgive 
   you!&quot;, so he sprays them with some flame-thrower action, setting 
   the room on fire. As Donny tries to escape the room, Mother is at the 
   door and drags him to his death in the flames. The film ends with a 
   young boy named Michael (Christian Isidore) watching television 
   (where a news reporter talks about Donny's death and the house 
   burning down), while his mother screams at him to clean up his room. 
   When Michael doesn't listen to her, she slaps him repeatedly across 
   his face. The look on Michael's face tells us another Donny has been created.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Releasing</A> is nine minutes longer (clocking in at 91 minutes vs. 
   the 82 minute theatrical R-Rated version released by Edward L. 
   Montoro's <A HREF="film_ventures_international_film_releases.htm">Film
    Ventures International</A>) than any other previous version (The 
   title on the print is <B>THE BURNING</B>, but the disc also has an 
   alternate title card available of the title we are all familiar 
   with). While the print is generally crisp (only one instance of 
   emulsion scratches that I saw), it has an annoying clicking sound in 
   the film's quieter scenes, but it is no deal-breaker since there 
   aren't many quiet scenes in the film. One has to wonder if William 
   Lustig saw this film before he made the gory <B><A HREF="maniac_1980.htm">MANIAC</A></B> 
   (1980), since both films are extremely similar. Both protagonists 
   keep the dead corpses of their victims and they come to life at the 
   end which results in their deaths. Also on the Blu-Ray is a recent 
   interview with Dan Grimaldi (he is best known for playing &quot;Patsy

   regular guest on many TV series and also appeared in two films by the 
   late H.B. Halicki: <B><A HREF="junkman_1982.htm">THE JUNKMAN</A></B> 
   [1982] and <B><A HREF="deadline_auto_theft_1983_gone_in_60_seconds_2_1988.htm">DEADLINE
    AUTO THEFT</A></B> [1983]). This was Grimaldi's feature film debut 
   and he brings up an interesting point about the film: If Donny's 
   mother's movements since she was dead are all in Donny's head, why is 
   it that Donny doesn't see his mother when he walks right past her and 
   the audience does? It's a valid point that should be investigated 
   furthur (but not by me). Director Joseph Ellison, whose only other 
   directorial effort was the musical drama <B><A HREF="joey_1986.htm">JOEY</A></B> 
   (1986), imbues this film with a lot of thought-provoking scenes. It 
   has a lot to say about child abuse and what such abuse can create, 
   but the screenplay, by Ellison, Ellen Hammill (who has an uncredited 
   cameo as Bobby's wife) &amp; Joseph R. Masefield (a Sound Editor on <B><A HREF="evil_dead_1983.htm">THE
    EVIL DEAD</A></B> [1981] and <B><A HREF="alone_in_the_dark_1982.htm">ALONE
    IN THE DARK</A></B> [1982]), leaves no doubt in the viewer's mind 
   that this is first and foremost a horror film. But whomever said that 
   a horror film could not leave you asking some valid questions long 
   after the film is over? Some of the best horror films are ones with a 
   message and I consider <B>DON'T GO IN THE HOUSE</B> a minor classic 
   of the genre. While there are a couple of stunt fire gags in the 
   film, the metal room burnings are done with overlays, but they are 
   very well done. This is one horror film where you don't have to leave 
   your mind at the door. The house where Donny lived was a real house 
   known as the &quot;Strauss Mansion&quot;. There a documentary on the 
   Blu-Ray that shows the house as it stands today, a museum rescued 
   from destruction by the Atlantic Highlands Historical Society in New 
   Jersey. A tour through the house (which was a low-income apartment 
   house when this film was made) shows that much of the house hasn't 
   changed in 37 years. Also starring Darcy Shean, Jim Donnegan (as the 
   gay department store clerk), Commander Johnny G. (as the disco's 
   D.J.), David Brody and&nbsp; Eileen Dunn as Michael's abusive mother.

   fact, it may be the stupidest (you'll be reading that word in several 
   forms a lot during this review) horror films ever made. And for that 
   reason alone. everyone must at least see it once. Really, you must. 
   The first two-thirds of this 82-minute film is mostly a showcase for 
   showing how a killer in the woods can murder people in various bloody 
   ways (in this film's defense, the body count is very high for this 
   genre) while intercutting <A HREF="dont_go_in_the_woods_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/don't go in the woods 1981 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>footage
    of the four stupidest people on Earth: hikers Peter (Jack 
   McClelland), Ingrid (Mary Gail Artz; now a successful Casting 
   Director), Craig (James P. Hayden) and Joanie (Angie Brown; they list 
   her name as &quot;Joanne&quot; in the credits, but call her 
   &quot;Joanie&quot; in the film) as they traverse the woods for God 
   knows what reason. The film opens with a woman running through a 
   stream from some unknown killer, who finally gets her, as we see the 
   water turn blood red.&nbsp; We then see a bird watcher getting hit in 
   the cheek by a rock thrown with a sling (the rock just doesn't hit 
   his cheek, it goes through it) and then getting his arm cut off, 
   blood spurting everywhere. We then switch to our stupid four hikers, 
   where the bossy Craig tells the other three the do's &amp; don't's of 
   hiking in the woods (even managing to mention the film's title). Cut 
   to a middle-aged couple in the woods, who get split-up from each 
   other. The man is throttled by the unseen killer and thrown off a 
   waterfall, landing on the rocks below (oblivious to two teenagers 
   frolicking in the water). The woman is shown crawling on the ground, 
   bleeding profusely, and then being dragged away by our killer. The 
   Sheriff (Ken Carter) and Deputy Benson (David Barth) get a report of 
   a missing person in the woods (they believe it is a bear attack 
   without even thinking that the person could actually be lost!), so 
   they go to the local store owner (Larry Roupe) to see if they can get 
   a description of the missing person. After the Sheriff gets a 
   description, he has to drag Deputy Benson away from a pinball machine 
   (My God, but it gets much, much stupider!). The Sheriff begins 
   driving the back roads of the woods to see if he can spot the missing 
   person and barely misses hitting a young girl in short shorts who is 
   rollerskating on the rocky road (What the Fuck?!?). We then switch 
   back to our hiking foursome, where Craig tells the worst horror 
   campfire story I have ever heard and the other three groan (and 
   rightfully so). Back to more killing, as we see Dick and Cherry 
   making out in a van (Dick has a poster of Farrah Fawcett on the 
   ceiling), when Cherry stops and says she sees someone outside. Dick 
   grabs his pistol and goes outside to investigate (He yells out, 
   &quot;Show yourself, you pencil-necked geek!&quot;) and Dick is 
   murdered. Cherry hears his screams and locks all the doors in the 
   van, only to have the killer bash Dick's bloody face over-and over on 
   one of the van's windows. The killer then overturns the van until it 
   rolls down an embankment and bursts into flames, burning Cherry 
   alive. Back to our foursome, where Peter wakes everyone up after 
   having a bad nightmare and they continue on with their hike (after 
   the three play a stupid practical joke on Joanie that could have 
   killed her). Cut back to the Sheriff, as he takes a plane to fly 
   above the woods to see if he can spot the missing person. He then 
   abruptly tells the pilot to head back to the airport because he 
   thinks he'll give the person one more day to show up. (What the 
   Fuck?!?). The pilot says, &quot;It's your nickel!&quot; We then view 
   a female landscape painter in mirrored aviator sunglasses (the iconic 
   image on most of the film's advertising materials), who has her baby 
   daughter in a bouncy harness a good thirty yards away (Is she stupid 
   or what?). She is stabbed repeatedly by the killer as she faces her 
   painting and we see her entrails hanging through a hole in the back 
   of her canvas. Her young baby daughter's bouncy harness is now empty. 
   We then switch back to our four hikers, where Peter stupidly decides 
   to head out on his own, but becomes scared when he thinks someone is 
   chasing him and heads back to his group. Turns out what was 
   &quot;chasing him&quot; was just another hiker (Who calmly says, 
   &quot;Sorry if I frightened you.&quot; after he passes our stupid 
   foursome). Peter cannot take the other three relentlessly making fun 
   of him, so when they make camp, Peter once again stupidly decides to 
   go out by himself and make his own camp (Peter really is a mental 
   midget). Now we go to two campers in sleeping bags, who are our next 
   victims. The female is trapped in her sleeping blanket and hung from 
   a tree and is bashed to death until blood flows out of the bottom of 
   the sleeping bag. The male victim is stabbed in his throat while 
   hiding in his sleeping bag and his blood gushes freely. Back to our 
   hikers. The threesome wonder if something has happened to Peter (who 
   is about a mile away scared shitless, yelling into the darkness that 
   he has a shotgun!) and Craig says that if he isn't back by 10:00 am 
   (Why 10:00 am? Wouldn't as soon as day breaks have been better?), 
   they will go looking for him. Peter spies on three people splashing 
   each other in a pond and then sees a fisherman (played by the film's 
   cameraman, Hank Zinman) take a bear trap to the face and then stabbed 
   by the killer, who we see for the first time. He looks like a tall 
   grizzled Mountain Man (played by Tom Drury) dressed in animal skins 
   (and a weird beaded object criss-crossing his face) who carries a 
   homemade bladed weapon (which is also covered in animal fur). Peter 
   is once again scared shitless (this time for real) and runs for his 
   life, with the Mountain Man not far behind. Joanie plays a painful 
   practical joke on Craig, so Craig reciprocates and traps Joanie in 
   her sleeping bag and hangs her from a tree, saying, &quot;Now I've 
   got you, bitch! Let's hear you say uncle! Say uncle! Say it, bag of 
   bitch! Say it! Say it, bag of bitch! Say it! Say uncle!&quot; 
   (Seriously, are these people stupid or what?). Joanie looks through a 
   hole in the sleeping bag and watches as the Mountain Man stabs Craig 
   several times and then cuts off his arm with his furry weapon. Joanie 
   escapes from the sleeping bag and runs for her life, while Ingrid 
   hears Craig's screams and heads for the campsite. After seeing all 
   the blood, Ingrid runs away and meets Peter (he informs her what is 
   going on). They find a cabin in the woods and (stupidly) go inside, 
   where it reeks of death. Peter sets off a booby trap which reveals 
   Craig's bloody corpse wrapped in plastic (All Ingrid can do is put 
   her hands over her eyes and yell out &quot;No! No! No!&quot; over and 
   over again.). They quickly exit the cabin and run for their lives. A 
   hiker (the one who scared the shit out of Peter earlier in the film) 
   finds the Mountain Man's jingly walking stick and Peter stabs him in 
   the stomach with a sharpened branch (Peter doesn't carry a knife, so 
   how did he sharpen a big branch so quickly?) when he mistakes him for 
   the killer. The Mountain Man finishes him off with a well-placed 
   flying spear and wounds Ingrid in the arm and head with two glancing 
   spears, but Ingrid and Peter manage to escape, while the Mountain Man 
   jumps up and down, cackling like a caveman. Peter patches Ingrid up 
   and assures her that they will make it back to civilization, which 
   they do (The Sheriff stupidly says, &quot;I should have went in there 
   earlier.&quot; when Deputy Benson tells him about Peter and Ingrid's 
   ordeal.). Peter still worries about Joanie and stupidly heads back 
   into the woods alone without any weapons (I mean, really, was Peter 
   born without a brain?). Joanie finds the cabin and, yes, you guessed 
   it, she goes inside, where she is sliced to death over and over with 
   a machete, in one of the film's bloodiest highlights. We then switch 
   to a guy in a wheelchair who repeatedly tries to make it up a 
   mountain trail (A guy in a wheelchair? What the Fuck?!?), but gravity 
   always gets the best of him (either rolling downhill or falling out 
   of his chair). He's no<A HREF="dont_go_in_the_woods_1981_dvd.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/don't go in the woods 1981 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   quitter, though, and keeps on trying.The Sheriff and Deputy Benson 
   are unable to get a helicopter (probably due to this film's low 
   budget), so they and a search party head out by foot (When Deputy 
   Benson learns that Peter is out there he says, &quot;You mean we have 
   to deal with a mental case, too?&quot;). The Sheriff heads out alone 
   to the cabin and discovers Joanie's sliced-up corpse. He is soon 
   joined by Deputy Benson and they carry Joanie's body to the recovery 
   area, where five other bodies have already been found. Peter watches 
   from the bushes as they carry Joanie's body. Now he's pissed! In the 
   stupidest part of this whole stupid movie, Ingrid's doctor brings her 
   to the recovery area, thinking Ingrid may be able to talk Peter into 
   turning himself in (Jesus Christ, this is getting ridiculous!). In 
   case you were wondering what happened to the wheelchair guy, he 
   finally makes it to the top of the trail, only to be instantly 
   beheaded, his headless corpse and wheelchair tumbling down the 
   mountain. Surprises of all stupidest surprises, Ingrid sneaks out of 
   the recovery area and heads out into the woods armed with a machete. 
   In the finale (Finally!), Peter and Ingrid reunite and kill the 
   Mountain Man with repeated spear and machete impalements (Deputy 
   Benson calmly says, &quot;Cute couple.&quot;). But one thing has been 
   left unanswered until now: What happened to the artist's baby girl? 
   When we see her at the end, she is alone in the woods holding an ax 
   (and looks to have aged a couple of years in a couple of days!). Will 
   she be the next killer in the woods?&nbsp; It comes as no surprise 
   that this film was directed by James Bryan (<B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Lady Street Fighter">LADY

   am a fan of his 1970 sexploitationer <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#DirtiestGameWorld">THE
    DIRTIEST GAME IN THE WORLD</A></B>), but at least the blood and high 
   body count will help you get through this stupidly scripted film, 
   which comes as no surprise (again) was written by one-timer Garth 
   Eliassen (who also cameos as a cop by the lake). The simplistic score 
   was composed by H. Kingsley Thurber (<B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Executioner Part 2">FROZEN
    SCREAM</A></B> - 1981), who also composed and sings the stupid song 
   that plays over the end credits (He did it as as joke, but Bryan put 
   it in the film anyway). The entire film was dubbed after being shot 
   and it is very obvious because some of the voices don't match the lip 
   movements. It's hard to believe that actor Vincent D'Onofrio would 
   direct a <A HREF="short reviews.htm#DontGoWoods2009">semi-remake of 
   this film in 2009</A> as a hipster musical (it is as equally terrible 
   as this film). Like I said in the beginning of this long review, 
   everyone must see this film at least once, if only to see the word 
   &quot;stupid&quot; come to life. Byran has gone on record saying that 
   he purposely made the movie cheesy, but judging from his other films, 
   I find that a highly dubious claim. Also starring Laura Trefts, Gerry 
   Klein, Carolyn Braza as Cherry and Frank Millen as Dick (who was 
   dubbed by Bryan when he wasn't available after the film was shot).

    OPEN THE DOOR!</A></B> (1975). When the film opens, we are 
   introduced to Dr. William Matthews (Andrew Sensening), a new 
   psychiatrist at Green Park Sanitarium, who is from the &quot;big 
   city&quot;. Sanitarium director Emily (Camilla Carr, who played 
   &quot;Harriet&quot; in the original film; she was a stock player in 
   many of S.F. Brownrigg's films) tells Dr. Matthews that he will be in 
   charge of a patient that is arriving tomorrow and to get Room #4 
   ready for his arrival. She hands Dr. Matthews the new patient's file 
   and later on he reads the file and says, &quot;Great. My first chance 
   to impress the boss and it's a lobotomized patient with no 
   brain!&quot; We also find out that Dr. Matthews left New York due to 
   the mysterious death of his wife (He tells Emily the details, as sad 
   music plays on the soundtrack). The next day, the new patient 
   arrives. It is Sam (Willie Minor Jr., played in the original film by 
   the late William Bill McGhee), who arrives to the sanitarium in a 
   wheelchair, but instinctively gets up and walks to Room #4 (Clue 
   alert!). Dr Matthews greets him in his room and the 74 year-old Sam 
   asks, &quot;Where is Dr. Stephens?&quot; Dr. Matthews informs Sam 
   that Dr. Stephens died a long time ago (he got an axe in the back in 
   the original film) and asks Sam what he likes to do. &quot;I like to 
   draw boats.&quot; is Sam's reply. (no lust for popsicles like in the 
   original film, although it is mentioned). We are then intriduced to 
   some of the patients at the sanitorium, straight out of Stereotypes 
   101. There's the elderly Milly (Lilly Hall), who has twitchy eyes, so 
   Dr. Mark Westmore (Earl Browning III) sticks a hypodermic needle in 
   her right eye (shown lovingly in close-up) and then hallucinates that 
   the room is being riddled with machine gun fire (Dr. Westmore is put 
   in another locked room, Emily saying that he is over-stressed). 
   Another patient is Karl (Gordon K. Smith), who repeats everything 
   that everyone says. Also on-board is Clive (Brady McInnes), who 
   always wants a cigarette, so Dr. Lance White (Frank Mosley) 
   continually shoves cigarettes in his mouth, saying &quot;You want 
   cigarettes? Here are your cigarettes!&quot; and gives him the option 
   of smoking or eating lunch (Clive picks lunch). The Stephens 
   Sanitarium is mentioned a few times, which interests Dr. Matthews, so 
   one night he goes on the internet and searches for it, coming up with 
   no hits. He searches Sam's name and comes up with more than a million 
   hits (too much for him to look for). Then his phone rings and it is a 
   drunk Dr. Lucy Mills (Arianne Margot), who hits on Dr. Matthews and 
   reveals that she is drunk on scotch. Then Dr. Matthews loses internet 
   access (Another clue!). The next morning Dr. Mills has no 
   recollection of calling Dr. Matthews (Dr. White says she called him, 
   too), saying that she hates scotch. It doesn't take a crazy person to 
   realize that the insane are running the asylum and when Dr. Matthews 
   realizes that Green Park is actually a renamed Stephens Sanitarium, 
   he grows suspicious of everyone (Like how Dr. White is visiting Sam 
   behind his back). The inmates start murdering the staff, such as 
   patient Roman (Chester Rushing) pulling hard on Nurse Sophie's (Kim 
   Foster) tongue and stabbing her in the stomach (the last time we see 
   Nurse Sophie is when her corpse is shown with her tongue hanging out 
   of her mouth!). Emily believes that Sam's presence is the cause of 
   the violence. She confesses to Dr. Matthews that she killed Dr. 
   Stephens and that she is actually Miss Charlotte (played by Rosie 
   Holotick in the original film) and then cuts her own throat in front 
   of him!. Nurse Jennifer (co-screenwriter and Associate producer Megan 
   Emerick) comes up with the idea of injecting all the violent patients 
   with Thorazine to sedate them and calm them down, but she only has<A HREF="dont_look_in_the_basement_2_2014b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/don't look in the basement 2 2015 poster12 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   enough for twelve injections. She hands out two needles full of the 
   sedative to Dr. Matthews, Dr. White and orderlies Bishop (Scott 
   Tepperman) and Billy (Jim O'Rear) and they go about sedating the 
   patients. Bishop and Billy discover a female patient in a closet 
   feasting on Emily's intestines, so they lock the closet door rather 
   than taking the chance of injecting her (Bishop and Billy are not 
   crazy and are in this film for &quot;comedy&quot; relief). In the 
   film's finale, the staff begin murdering the patients, especially Dr. 
   White, who we find out was a good friend of Dr. Stephens (he doesn't 
   even look 41 years old!) and was Sam's doctor when he was committed 
   to a State asylum after the massacre in the original film. Dr. White 
   is now down in the basement with a gagged and tied-up Dr. Lucy Mills 
   and he injects Dr. Matthews with half a dose of the sedative so he 
   can watch him stab Dr. Mills to death (shown off-screen). Sam shows 
   up and stabs Dr. White to death. The film ends with Dr. Matthews and 
   Sam sitting by a lake, while a smiling Sam pilots a remote-control 
   toy boat. We also find out the fates of Bishop, Billy and Nurse 
   Jennifer, none of who were crazy. A happy ending for all the 
   &quot;normal&quot; people. Although professionally made, <B><A HREF="dont_look_in_the_basement_2_2014b.htm">DON'T
    LOOK IN THE BASEMENT 2</A></B> is rather tame when compared to the 
   original film, Besides the intestine eating, the tongue pulling, 
   throat slashing and the needle in the eye, this film is restrained 
   when showing bloody violence (and when we do see gore, it is just 
   quick glimpses). It is also missing the sleaze factor, which is what 
   made the original film so memorable. The surprises are telegraphed 
   way ahead of the reveals, so if you are looking for a good mystery 
   mixed in with your horror, look somewhere else. There are some blurry 
   black &amp; white flashbacks that contain snippets of the original 
   film (it is in the public domain) and the acting by the cast is 
   pretty good, but, all in all, this film is just a pimple on the 
   original movie's ass. The closing credits end with &quot;for 
   dad&quot;. I'm not sure if he would approve. The screenplay is a 
   mess, as people can't determine when the massacre at the Stephens 
   Sanitarium occurred. They mention two dates: 1972 and 1973. You would 
   think Anthony Brownrigg would know the exact date. Also starring 
   Carolyn King, Joseph Spector and Cathrine Hatcher. Competently made, 
   but boring as hell. This didn't get a disc release until 2017, when <A HREF="http://www.brinkvision.com">BrinkVision</A> 
   picked it up for a <A HREF="dont_look_in_the_basement_2_2014b.htm">Blu-Ray</A>

    and we then see the ouija board's planchette move by itself,

   in his past that only he and friend Tony (Juan Ignacio Aranda) know 
   about, Michael believes in the Devil, and has even given him a 
   nickname: &quot;Virgil&quot;. It's not long before Michael begins 
   having terrible nightmares of bloody hands bursting through his 
   bedroom ceiling and knives being thrusted into the bodies of his 
   friends and he wakes up with terrible headaches. But are these 
   nightmares or prophecies of things to come? Michael falls in love 
   with beautiful schoolmate Alex (Gabriela Hassel) and pops her cherry 
   in his bedroom. He gives her a single red rose and says to her, 
   &quot;As long as there is love between you and I, this rose will 
   never wither.&quot; (Wow. If I were in high school and popped a 
   girl's cherry in my bedroom, that would be the last thing on my mind! 
   Besides, what teenage boy talks like that anyway?). Michael has a 
   vision (whenever he gets a vision, the pupils of his eyes turn blood 
   red) of his friend Debbie (Cecilia Tijerini) being viciously slashed 
   to death in her bedroom (the knife ends up buried in the top of her 
   head). Michael begins popping Tylenol like they were candy and takes 
   to wearing sunglasses all the time, even when he is indoors. A head 
   pokes through his TV set and tells him that his friend Cristy 
   (Melinda McCallum) will die if he doesn't take her out of town by 
   midnight. This puts a strain on his budding relationship with Alex 
   and Mom makes him go to a doctor for a checkup, who then tells Mom 
   that David needs to see a psychiatrist and pronto! When Cristy is 
   killed with the same strange knife as Debbie, Michael tells his Mom 
   that he thinks best friend Tony is possessed by Virgil and is 
   responsible for the killings. Rather than believe him, sauced-up Mom 
   has the doctor sedate him and when his father, Fred (Eduardo 
   Noriega), shows up, things take a turn for the worse. While Mom and 
   Dad are downstairs arguing, Cristy's brother, John (Roberto 
   Palazuelos), kidnaps Michael thinking he is responsible for his

   lead Jon Michael Bischof (although he's not the only offender), some 
   rather convenient (and unbelievable) plot contrivances and because it 
   was filmed in English rather than it's native Spanish. It's apparent 
   that co-scripter Galindo Jr. (working with Bruce Glenn) didn't have a 
   handle on the English language as most of the dialogue is stilted and 
   even though it's plain to see that nearly everyone here is speaking 
   English, they are all obviously overdubbed. <B><A HREF="dont_panic_1987b.htm">DON'T
    PANIC</A></B> is very bloody in spots, but most of the running time 
   is spent on endless scenes of Michael trying to convince everyone 
   else that he is not crazy. The film plunges into the depths of 
   unbelievability when Michael and John rescue drunk friend Robert 
   (Raul Arauza Jr.) from Virgil's wrath, only to leave him alone in a 
   car while Michael goes back to the apartment to retrieve Robert's 
   pants (!) and a shotgun-toting John goes to the grocery store to pick 
   up a couple of packs of smokes (!!). Robert then gets his throat 
   graphically sliced open by a possessed Tony and all I wanted to do 
   was kick scripters Galindo Jr. and Glenn in their nuts for making it 
   so goddamned obvious. Don't get me started on the scene where Michael 
   bursts into Alex's house and interrupts a dinner party being thrown 
   by Alex's rich father. Rather than tossing him out on his ass, Alex's 
   father offers him a glass of wine (I guess there's no minimum age 
   requirement for drinking alcohol in Mexico). Alex then pulls out a 
   gun and begins shooting-up the place, grabs Alex by the arm and runs 
   out of the house. What the flying fuck?!? This is a dreadful excuse 
   for a horror film with nothing but a few bloody scenes (mostly knife 
   violence), lots of inane dialogue and piss-poor acting. Watching this 
   film is the equivalent of having bamboo chutes shoved under your 
   fingernails. Also starring George Luke, Edna Bolkan, Evangelina

   director Andreas Schnaas has a one-track mind and is quickly becoming 
   a one-trick pony. All he seems to care about is gore, gore, gore, 
   letting the story take a back seat. While I have nothing against gore 
   (believe me, it has its place in horror films and I'll be the first 
   to admit it!), it sure would be nice if Schnaas took some time to 
   wrap all that bloodshed around a decent plot. <B><A HREF="dont_wake_the_dead_2008b.htm">DON'T
    WAKE THE DEAD</A></B> opens with voiceover narration telling us that 
   a long time ago, a group of Knights Templar were killed at a castle 
   and every 66 years, they rise from their graves and go on a bloody 
   murder spree for one night. The only two things that can stop them 
   are the morning sun and the Sword of Mecca, the weapon originally 
   used to kill them all. We then switch to modern day, as a bus load of 
   buxom women are on their way to that very same castle to help their 
   friend Lana (Sonja Kerskes) renovate the place, where a bad German 
   thrash band called Gang Loco (they have their own topless woman 
   dancing on stage while they all play their one annoying chord) is the 
   featured musical guest. Ignoring a warning from a mortorcycle-riding 
   Vincent (Ralph Fellows) to turn the bus around, the girls make it to 
   the castle, where they <A HREF="dont_wake_the_dead_2008b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/don't wake the dead poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="207" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>are
    greeted by Herr Janowitz (Wolfgang Cloris Wobeto), a gaunt, 
   pasty-faced butler (Flashbacks show that he was involved with the 
   Nazis at this castle during the 1940's and they battled the revived 
   Knights Templar.). The girls ignore Herr Janowitz (one of them calls 
   him &quot;freakshow&quot;) and hook-up with Lana, who assigns the 
   girls bedrooms that come complete with peepholes. While Vincent 
   performs some blood ritual on the castle grounds (complete with CGI 
   spirits), the girls decide to explore the castle, not knowing that 
   K.C. (Maren Lisner), one of their own, has slipped in the bathroom 
   and bashed her head against the edge of the bathtub. The girls 
   stupidly split-up to check out the castle&nbsp; (horror film 
   stereotype 101), with Herr Janowitz showing a couple of the girls the 
   castle's graveyard. As the film progresses, we learn that Vincent's 
   grandfather stopped the last Knights Templar attack (during the 
   castle's Nazi reign) and has passed down the Sword of Mecca to him, 
   for tonight is the night of the Templar's rising and no one is safe. 
   The rest of the film is nothing more than a series of extreme gore 
   set-pieces, as the Knights Templar begin slaughtering everyone in 
   sight, beginning with the members of Gang Loco (I'm an athiest, but 
   this is one time I thanked God) and then moving on to the girls, who 
   manage to do the stupidest things as possible at the most inopportune 
   times (horror film stereotype 102). Can Vincent manage to save any of 
   them before the Templars and some revived Nazi zombies (packing 
   still-working machine guns!) kill them all before calling it a 
   night?&nbsp; My, oh, my. Where do I begin describing how truly awful 
   this film really is? Let's begin with the dialogue. While everyone 
   speaks English here, it's quite apparent that it is their second (or 
   third) language because their line readings are simply atrocious.

    THE IMPALER</A></B> - 2003) and screenwriters Klaus Dzuck &amp; Ted 
   Geoghegan haven't got a clue how to use the English language to their 
   advantage, especially the scene where Beth (Fiana de Guzman) puts the 
   moves on Vincent, just after he tells her that he's a monk who took a 
   vow of chastity. Forget that all this is happening while everyone 
   around them is being sliced to pieces, it's just something that would 
   never happen in the real world. And therein lies this film's major 
   problem: While everyone is being killed in the most gruesome of 
   fashions (sword impalement to the vagina; manual disembowelments; 
   beheadings; head crushed in a van door; body sliced vertically in 
   half; knife in head; etc; all the effects are rather well-done), the 
   girls fight among themselves about who is going to be the first to 
   deflower Vincent. Un-fucking-believable. Since most of the girls are 
   uglier than sin (Hey, I'm German, so I can make that statement, 
   especially the bald-headed Cristiane Malia, who plays Shannon), the 
   plentiful nude scenes aren't even eye candy (they are more like eye 
   poison), and just when you think it couldn't get any worse, the 
   zombified members of Gang Loco take center stage and put on a concert 
   (this is one of the reasons why I am still an athiest)! Oh, my aching 
   eyes and ears! Schnaas plays much of the film as broad comedy 
   (Vincent utilizes a flying guillotine on some of his victims; a 
   tribute to the Hong Kong martial arts flick <B><A HREF="master_of_the_flying_guillotine_1975.htm">MASTER
    OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINE</A></B> - 1975), but the film falls flatter 
   than a half-cooked wienerschnitzel. To add insult to injury, Schnaas 
   closes the film with a music video by...Gang Loco, who apparently 
   only have one song on their playlist (at least in this film). For 
   better films about the Knights Templar check out director Amando de

   New England, where we see a power company employee driving to a 
   notorious haunted house (the same house used in the other three 
   haunted house films mentioned above) to turn on the electricity. When 
   he was a kid, he broke some of the house's windows and when he goes 
   down to the basement to turn on the electricity, a demon comes out of 
   nowhere and pushes him into the fusebox and he is electrocuted. Four 
   college students get free rent for the semester and $10,000 to stay 
   at the house and fix it up. The college kids meet the always-angry 
   Mr. Hoskins (Ricco Se) at the front of the house and he hands 
   would-be actor Rick (Christian Harmony; who idolizes W.C. Fields) an 
   envelope which details all the work they need to do at the house. The 
   other three kids take one good look at the outside of the house (all 
   the windows are boarded-up and half of the porch railing is lying on 
   the ground) and they rip into Rick since he took the job without even 
   coming to see the house first. Rick says, &quot;It's not like the 
   house is haunted or anything.&quot; which jokester Owen (Don Maloney, 
   who gets the lion's share of funny lines) replies, &quot;Rick, I 
   doubt any self-respecting ghost would live here!&quot; (Oh, if they 
   only knew!). Owen and Tammy (Lauren Woodland; &quot;Emily 
   Francisco&quot; on the <B><A HREF="alien_nation_the_series_1989-1990.htm">ALIEN
    NATION</A></B> TV series [1989 - 1990] and series of TV movies) get 
   pissed and Tammy says she is leaving, but Rick's girlfriend Susan 
   (Suzanne Bridgham) talks her out of it. Tammy says she will stay as 
   long as she gets first pick of the bedrooms. They all enter the house 
   and see what an awful state of disrepair it is in (Owen says, 
   &quot;The dorm's looking pretty good right now!&quot;) and are 
   greeted by a mouse scurrying on the floor. Tammy chases it away, 
   saying rodents don't bother her because she was raised on a farm. We 
   are then treated to an 80's-like montage of the four college kids 
   cleaning the inside of the house, while a funky tune titled &quot;Love
    In The House&quot; (sung by Michele Vice) plays on the soundtrack. 
   After we get to know a little info and quirks about the four kids 
   (Like Tammy has a doll collection and Susan's parents aren't too 
   pleased that she is dating an actor), Owen (who has a secret crush on 
   Tammy) finds a dusty book in the house's library titled 
   &quot;Superstitions Of Early New England&quot;, which happens to be 
   the subject of his college thesis &quot;Mystery And Magic In Colonial 
   America&quot;. Owen discovers that the house was built on the site 
   where, back in the 1600's, people use to perform sexual Devil 
   worship. The house was built by Walter Van Buren (Robert G. Hall) a 
   couple of centuries ago and we are treated to a flashback (narrated 
   by Owen) of what went on during that time (all using gore and nudity 
   footage from earlier Corman films, like <B><A HREF="haunting_of_morella_1990.htm">THE
    HAUNTING OF MORELLA</A></B> [1990], <B><A HREF="burial_of_the_rats_1995.htm">BURIAL
    OF THE RATS</A></B> [1995] and even a scene of Claudia Christian 
   from <B><A HREF="#HauntingHellHouse98">THE HAUNTING OF HELL HOUSE</A></B> 
   [1998]), as Van Buren raised demons and ghosts from Hell until the 
   town revolted and killed him. The kids keep hearing strange moaning 
   coming from the house, but fool themselves into believing that old 
   houses like this make those kind of noises all the time (I would have 
   beat a hasty retreat as soon as I heard the first moan!). We then 
   watch as Susan takes a shower (new nudity alert!) when a severed 
   demon hand appears on one of her shoulders. Thinking that Rick as 
   joined her in the shower, she scream out loud when she discovers what 
   it really is, as Rick and Tammy run to the bathroom (Owen is 
   blissfully ignorant, as he has headphones on, listening to music 
   while typing his term paper on his computer). When they get there, 
   the demon hand has disappeared. Tammy goes back to her bedroom, only 
   to find that all her dolls have been moved (two dolls are positioned 
   like they are performing oral sex on each other!). She thinks Owen is 
   responsible, so she goes into his bedroom and yanks the headphones 
   out of his ears, but Owen denies doing it. The next morning, Tammy 
   discovers that all her dolls have been returned to their proper 
   place, but someone altered Owen's term paper on his computer, adding 
   sex-filled passages (Tammy thinks Owen did it himself and is 
   disgusted when she reads the first entry). All four of them gather 
   together in the kitchen to discuss the strange occurrences happening 
   in the house, so Rick and Owen go down to the basement to check if 
   there is anything hinky down there. While Rick is checking the 
   fusebox, Owen has a close encounter with a female demon, who floats 
   in the air, her fingernails grow into claw-like objects in front of 
   our eyes and she has a split tongue like a snake. The female demon 
   almost gets Owen, but she disappears when Rick enters the area. They 
   then hear the two girls screaming upstairs and discover the kitchen 
   sink is overflowing with maggots. That night, Rick is possessed by a 
   demon while making love to Susan (more new nudity alert!). After he 
   is done with Susan, he goes to Tammy bedroom and has sex with her 
   (while her creepy dolls eyes move to watch the action), where he also 
   sports a split tongue and tries to shove it down Tammy's throat. When 
   Tammy wakes up in the morning, she believes it was all a dream, but 
   she is naked and a naked Rick is lying next to her. Susan enters the 
   room and sees both of them in bed and runs out crying. Rick has no 
   memory of even going into Tammy's bedroom, so everyone discusses what 
   happened downstairs, where the female demon shows herself to all of 
   them and floats above the floor while saying, &quot;Come to me!&quot; 
   to Rick. Rick says, &quot;Back off, bitch!&quot; and the female demon 
   grows her fingernails once again and tries to slash Rick, but they 
   all escape the house and get in their cars to drive to the college. 
   They go to talk to paranormal expert Professor Lamont (Top-billed Roy 
   Scheider; <B><A HREF="jaws_1975.htm">JAWS</A></B> - 1975; who appears 
   36 minutes into the film and lasts for about thirty minutes, but he 
   doesn't phone his performance in. He throws himself into the role and 
   looks to be having a great time.), who has given up on investigating 
   the occult because he had a prank pulled on him which nearly cost him 
   his job at the college (It has to do with Cotton Mather. Google 
   him.). After listening to their story, the Professor believes he is 
   being pranked again and says to the four of them, &quot;Get the hell 
   out of here before I fuck you right on the spot. Class 
   dismissed!&quot; (Scheider is really funny in his delivery. He also 
   says, &quot;I don't do ghosts anymore...and I never did 
   demons!&quot;). When Owen mentions that the house they are staying in 
   is the Van Buren house, the Professor says that an electrician was 
   found dead there a week earlier, something the four college kids were 
   never told before. When the kids notice that the Professor's 
   assistant Lydia (Teresa DePriest) bears an uncanny resemblance to the 
   female demon in the house (who we find out was named Evelyn), the 
   Professor becomes interested again because Lydia is a direct 
   descendant of the Van Buren family and she is also a clairvoyant. The 
   six of them head back to the Van Buren house (Where the Professor 
   tells the kids that they should read his book on the occult. When 
   Owen mentions that they are penniless college students, the Professor 
   tells them that he has 500 copies sitting in his garage and will 
   gladly give each of them a copy and sign it, too!). Once inside the 
   house, the Professor sets up his electronic equipment, while the 
   clairvoyant Lydia checks out each room for ghosts and demons. Lydia 
   watches her evil doppelganger Evelyn making love to a man in one of 
   the upstairs bedrooms and then she rips off his head. Lydia passes 
   out and when she comes to, she tells everyone that Evelyn isn't the 
   only demon in this house. She says that something important is hidden 
   behind one of the walls in the basement. While Rick is breaking down 
   the wall with a pickaxe, Evelyn tries to attack Tammy, but Owen 
   impales her with a broom handle and they both run outside. Rick 
   breaks through the wall, where they find the chained-up skeleton of 
   Evelyn. The Professor believes the danger is over because of the 
   discovery, but Evelyn appears behind him and rips his face off (A 
   really graphic effect that comes unexpectedly. Effects were done by 
   the Almost Human effects house.). Lydia tells Susan to burn the 
   skeleton, so she throws an oil lantern at it and it bursts into 
   flames. So does Evelyn. All the kids go to the police while Mr. 
   Hoskins returns to the house, only to discover that the inside of the 
   house is destroyed. The college kids are forced to come back to the 
   house by Deputy Abbott (Brendan Murray), who wants them <A HREF="doorway_2000b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/doorway british dvd front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="203" HEIGHT="290" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>to
    show him where the Professor's body is. Mr. Hoskins goes down to the 
   basement and finds it full of demons. He is sucked through the fiery 
   hole in the basement wall, which turns out to be a gateway to Hell. 
   Burning the skeleton allowed it to open. Deputy Abbott forces the 
   four kids to enter the house, but he allows them to remain upstairs 
   while he goes down to the basement to look for the Professor's body. 
   Evelyn has returned, as the college kids find all their possessions 
   destroyed (including Tammy's dolls and Owen's computer). Rick is once 
   again possessed by a demon and Lydia gets a psychic image and races 
   to the house in her car. Sadly, Rick has a pickaxe planted in his 
   head and the demon materializes (he looks like a <B><A HREF="hellraiser_1987.htm">HELLRAISER</A></B> 
   reject) and Susan is killed. Tammy and Owen discover that a medallion 
   is needed to close the doorway to Hell and Tammy finds a secret 
   passageway in a bookcase as they are being chased by Evelyn. It leads 
   them to the basement, where we see Lydia grab the medallion and jump 
   into the fiery hole. Evelyn tries to stop her, but the wall closes up 
   and Evelyn is decapitated when she is caught between one side of the 
   wall and the other and the house burns to the ground. The film ends 
   with this comic coda: <B>&quot;Although no bodies were ever found,

   a pretty funny haunted house film that surprises you with the gory 
   demise of Roy Scheider, which should seem out-of-place with the rest 
   of the film, but somehow it doesn't. Director/screenwriter Robert B. 
   Druxman (who is credited for the story to <B><A HREF="#Demon Slayer">DEMON

    AND CAPONE</A></B> [1995]) keeps the pace quick and some of the 
   dialogue is laugh-out-loud funny. That doesn't means that he skimps 
   on the gore and nudity, because there is plenty throughout the film 
   and, besides the short flashback segment, it is all original. Like 
   all the other films Corman made in Ireland (which also includes <B><A HREF="bloodfist_8_hard_way_out_1996.htm">BLOODFIST

   only. These films really need to be remastered in their original 
   aspect ratio and be released on DVD or Blu-Ray, so we can appreciate

   During Christmas vacation, five college students volunteer to close

   groups constant pranking on each other, as well as deal with 
   unwelcome illegal resident John Hemmit (Woody Roll), strange horny 
   furniture buyer Bobby Lee Tremble (Dennis Ely) and a handyman (Jake 
   Jones) whose power tools end up missing. Could any of these people be 
   the sneaker-wearing psycho? When the group try to locate John and run 
   him off (he's always scaring the girls by peering into the windows at 
   night), they are unable to find him. The handyman is the next to die, 
   thanks to a power drill to the back to his head. As the days wear on, 
   it becomes apparent that the students have issues of their own. One 
   disappears for hours on end, one has anger problems and Joanne is 
   uncertain of her future with her boyfriend Tim (Robert Frederick). 
   When the phone lines go dead and the electricity is shut off, the 
   killing begins to intensify. Brian (David Snow) is attacked with a 
   machete. Patti (Pamela Holland) is put in a vat of boiling water and 
   cooked alive. John attacks Joanne and Craig (Stephen Sachs), but they 
   both get away and Joanne finds Brian dismembered body. While Joanne 
   thinks John is the killer (she clobbers him over the head with a 
   baseball bat), she soon finds out that the killer is much more 
   familar, too familar for Joanne's good, as he shows her the results 
   of all his murderous handiwork that he has hidden in a tunnel under 
   the dormitory.&nbsp; This is the first film for 
   directors/screenwriters Stephen Carpenter and Jeffrey Obrow (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Power1983">THE

   standard &quot;killer on the loose in a building full of teens&quot; 
   plot. Some of the kills are pretty inventive (effects courtesy of 
   Matthew Mungle), although some of the gorier deaths look to be 
   trimmed to receive an R rating. There's still plenty of blood to keep 
   gorehounds happy and the acting doesn't suck, which is a big plus for 
   a film like this. Woody Roll resembles a slightly demented Paul Le 
   Mat and he's pretty scary for someone who isn't the killer. The 
   killer's motivation is pretty weak (He's in love with Jennifer, but 
   she's not in love with him, so he murders anyone who even talks to 
   her. That's taking devotion a little too far.), but the standoff 
   between him, Bobby Lee and the police is ingenious and very well 
   executed (literally!). The ending is also very nasty without being 
   graphic. It's not a happy ending, by the way. This is a pretty 
   enjoyable way to spend 85 minutes if you don't set your sights too

    A.D. 1972</A><A NAME="DraculaAD1972"></A> (1972) -</B> This was one 
   of the Hammer Dracula films that I absolutely hated when I originally 
   saw it in a theater in 1972. I hated it so much, I never watched it 
   again. That is until it made its premiere on Turner Classic Movies 
   (TCM) on October 30th, 2015 and I decided to watch it for the first 
   time in 43 years. You know what? I actually liked it this time. I 
   remember when first going to see it that taking the Hammer Dracula 
   saga out of the Gothic era to modern times was a big mistake, but 
   call it nostalgia or call it old age, I now look at it as one of 
   Hammer's fastest-paced Dracula films they made. For the first time 
   since Christopher Lee portrayed Dracula and Peter Cushing portrayed 
   Prefessor Van Velsing, this film doesn't follow the continuing story 
   and rebirth of Dracula from the previous film, since Peter Cushing 
   didn't appear in <B><A HREF="scars_of_dracula_1970.htm">SCARS OF DRACULA</A></B> 
   (1970; which some people think is the most violent of Hammer's 
   Dracula films and they may be right). This film starts woth one of 
   the most exciting openings of any Hammer Dracula. It's 1872 and 
   Dracula and Van Helsing are battling on a <A HREF="dracula_ad_1972_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dracula a.d. 1972 poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>runaway
    carriage. The carriage hits a tree and Dracula gets impaled by the 
   spokes of a wooden wheel. Just before he dies of a severe concussion, 
   Van Helsing helps in driving the spokes in deeper Dracula's heart and 
   then Van Helsing collapses on his back, his finale visage looking up 
   into the sky before he passes away. We then see a mysterious stranger 
   collect Dracula's ring and some of Dracula's dust a glass vial. While 
   Van Helsing's funeral is being held, the stranger digs a small hole 
   in unconsecrated ground on the other side of the fence of the 
   cemetery and pours some of Dracula's dust into it. The camera then 
   pans into the sky and we see a jet airplane fly overhead (it's a 
   clever segue). It's now 1972 and we are at a swinging party where a 
   British band called Stoneground is playing (the famous band Faces 
   were originally to play in this scene, but they pulled out at the 
   last moment) and the young people are having a good time and the 
   older people are horrified. A young man called &quot;Johnny 
   Alucard&quot; (an incredibly young Christopher Neame; <B><A HREF="hellbound_1993.htm">HELLBOUND</A></B> 
   - 1993), a descendant of the mysterious stranger 100 years earlier, 
   crashes the party and ingratiates himself with the young people, 
   including Jessica Van Helsing (Stephanie Beacham; <B><A HREF="horror_planet_1980.htm">HORROR
    PLANET</A></B> - 1980), who lives with her father Professor Van 
   Helsing (Cushing). He gets off on torturing one old woman by making 
   believe that he is going to break one of her valuable porcelain 
   statues, but he puts it back on the table as he walks out the door. 
   Then his arm comes inside the door and knocks the statue down, 
   breaking it. The police dub them a &quot;fringe group&quot;, so 
   Johnny says why don't they all go to an unconsecrated church that 
   night and peform a satanic ritual for shits and giggles? Of course we 
   know it is for more nefarious reasons and the only one to have 
   reservations about the whole thing is Jessica, but her boyfriend Bob 
   (Philip Miller; this was his only acting role of note) talks her into 
   going. In order to get to the church, they must first pass through a 
   graveyard, where Jessica discovers that her great-great-grandfather 
   died on that very exact date. This is the 100th anniversary of both 
   his and Dracula's deaths. Bob says it is nothing but a coincidence 
   and they meet everyone at the church. Johnny Alucard performs a 
   ritual for the Demon of Forbidden Knowledge and says &quot;I demand 
   an audience with his Satanic Majesty!&quot; and says that they all 
   have to swear in front of the Devil to keep this Black Mass a secret 
   or a curse will befall them. He needs a female &quot;sacrifice&quot; 
   and asks Jessica to join him, but she refuses, so Laura (Caroline 
   Munro; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Starcrash">STARCRASH</A></B> - 
   1978) offers her services instead. Laura lies down on an altar while 
   Johnny slices his arm with an ancient dagger, collecting all his 
   blood in a goblet and then pouring it on Laura, who is shocked. All 
   the other members of the group leave in disgust, except for Johnny 
   and Laura, who go to the graveyard and pours the final amount of dust 
   on Dracula's grave (which looks like it is breathing). Dracula (Lee) 
   suddenly appears and Johnny says that it was he who raised him from 
   the dead. Dracula simply says &quot;It was my will!&quot; and sucks 
   Laura dry. Johnny becomes Dracula's vampire servant and he tells the 
   group that Laura was in on the gag from the beginning (and that the 
   blood was nothing but blood capsules) and she is on a train to 
   collect some money from a relative (Jessica is not buying it for a 
   minute). Meanwhile, three young boys kicking a ball around find 
   Laura's dead body in a pile of loose cement rubble. The police think 
   it is the work of a sex maniac and that she was already wearing a 
   shroud (What one has to do with another is still a mystery to me). 
   Luckily, her fingerprints are on file for a drug arrest four months 
   ago and people say she hung out with a &quot;fringe group&quot; (What 
   in the hell does that mean? They are just having fun, smoking hash 
   and partying like everyone young person did in the 70's), including 
   Jessica Van Helsing (Who is the most normal woman I have seen in a 
   horror film). Inspector Murray (Michael Coles; <B><A HREF="dr_who_and_the_daleks_1965.htm">DR.
    WHO AND THE DALEKS</A></B> - 1965) talks to Professor Van Helsing 
   and when he mentions that Laura's body was completely drained of 
   blood, it strikes a cord in the Professor. He tells Inspector Murray 
   that they may be dealing with vampires. In a refreshing change of 
   pace, the Inspector actually believes the Professor (after a short 
   time not believing him), but tells them to keep it between 
   themselves, because other people in power won't be so understanding. 
   Jessica walks into the house and the Inspector talks to her, where 
   she learns for the first time that Laura is dead. The Inspector wants 
   to talk to Jessica's friends, but his partner says kids won't talk to 
   him, but Inspector Murray says that when he finds a piece of hash on 
   one of them, they will be more than willing to talk. Meanwhile, 
   Johnny brings Dracula Angel Gaynor (Marsha Hunt; <B><A HREF="howling_2_1985.htm">HOWLING
    II:...YOUR SISTER IS A WEREWOLF</A></B> - 1985)&nbsp; and he drains 
   her of all her blood, but he yells to Johnny, &quot;She's not the 
   one!&quot; and will only make Johnny truly immortal if he brings 
   Jessica to him. Dracula hopes to wipe out the Van Helsing bloodline 
   from the Earth, so the Professor dies a lonely man with no one to 
   carry on his work. Johnny starts turning members of the fringe group 
   into vampires or killing them and when Professor Murray mentions that 
   two more girls from the group were murdered last night. He is amazed 
   when Van Helsing describes both murders perfectly (He also explains 
   that Johnny's last name is &quot;Dracula&quot; spelled backwards). 
   Bob (wearing a scarf around his neck, uh, oh!) takes Jessica for a 
   ride, even though she doesn't want to, and they meet Johnny. They 
   both bare their fangs to Jessica and she is knocked out. When Bob 
   goes to put the bite on her, Johnny (who had his hand burned grabbing 
   Jessica's crucifix) tells him not to touch her. She is Dracula's 
   property now. Anna (Janet Kay; <B><A HREF="and_now_the_screaming_starts_1973.htm">AND

   and Inspector Murray where Johnny lives (she spent a short time there 
   once and became so freaked out, she had to leave) and he asks the 
   Inspector to give him an hour before he and his men enter Johnny's 
   house. Johnny tries to put the bite on the Professor as the sun 
   begins to rise, but the Professor throws a Bible with a crucifix 
   around it into Johnny's coffin, making sure Johnny has no place to 
   sleep during the day. In an ingenious move, the Professor uses a 
   round hand mirror to reflect the sun onto Johnny, forcing him to fall 
   into the bathtub and accidentally turning the shower on (vampires 
   can't survive in flowing water, a legend that was created in one of 
   Hammer's previous Dracula films). Johnny dies and his skin begins to 
   peel, just as the Inspector and his men arrive (Johnny managed to 
   stab the Professor in the arm with a switchblade, which a medic 
   patches up). The Professor knows where Jessica is, but he once again

   The Professor is seen tinkering around in a barn and then goes to 
   save Jessica and stabs Dracula in the heart with a sacrimonial 
   dagger. Janet is still under Dracula's control, so she pulls the 
   dagger out of Dracula and he's good as new. This leads them all to 
   the barn, where the Professor had booby-trapped it. He gives Dracula 
   a face-full of holy water and then pushes him face-first into a 
   grave, which has a sharp stake protruding from it. The Professor 
   pushes Dracula's body down with a shovel until the stake protrudes 
   out his back and Dracula once again turns to dust. Jessica snaps out 
   of her spell and is no worse for wear, but all her friends are dead.

   CBS Late Movie changed the title of this film to <B>DRACULA TODAY</B>,
    where it went over like a lead balloon. Not only were the clothes 
   and hairstyles completely different from 1972 to 1981, the slang used 
   in the film was completely different than what was spoken then. CBS 
   went back to calling it by its proper name after only one showing 
   under that ridiculous title. I actually has a good time watching this 
   film after 43 years and consider it one of the best 70's Hammer 
   Dracula films. Besides, Christopher Lee has more dialogue in this 
   film than in three of his 60's Dracula films combined. Since both 
   Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are no longer with us, the world is 
   a sadder place. This film was released theatrically two days before <B><A HREF="horror_express_1972.htm">HORROR

   Diana wakes up and finds her engagement ring missing (she lost it in 
   her nightmare), she and Jenny head to the basement, only to find Paul

   believe that her nightmares are real, so Jenny stays with her on a

   Grace is a high fall artist who draws people to the church with her 
   30 foot dives, while her fiance's brother, Jesse (Michael Pataki),

   starts to slip into an &quot;imaginary world&quot; (as the film's 
   narrator tells us). While searching for her father in a seedy hotel 
   she meets a pimp/mortician (Marc Lawrence, who has a stable of the 
   ugliest whores this side of Afghanistan!) who tells her that he knew

   withholding &quot;The Secret&quot; from her, especially about her 
   rapidly-approaching 18th birthday, but the obvious question remains 
   why Horny is killing the kids of other parents who all graduated 
   tegether years earlier. While Mackenzie tries to avoid Horny's 
   cleaver with Fisher's help, she also tries to figure out who is 
   dressing as Horny and killing her friends. Don't hink too hard 
   Mackenzie, otherwise you'll become retarded. The audience (including 
   those with an IQ that matches their age, have figured out his 
   identity long before the film ended).&nbsp; It's hard to believe that 
   it took the joint effort of two people to direct and write this 
   abomination (Maybe I shouldn't be surprised. Too many cooks spoil the 
   stew and how many films can you count on one hand that were directed 
   by more than one person that can be considered good? Maybe <B><A HREF="blair_witch_project_1999.htm">THE

   trusted with a computer or a camera ever again. While there are a few 
   bloody practical gore effects (Cleaver in the head [a very easy 
   effect to pull off], decapitation at the jawline), there are also 
   some crappy CGI effects, none so bad as a girl getting her head

   island of Tasmania, Australia to search and photograph the 
   thought-to-be-extinct Tasmanian Tiger. Nina has a secondary reason 
   for going: Her sister &quot;fell off the radar&quot; eight years ago 
   while in the same area and Nina would like to discover the truth 
   about her drowning death, as the last thing she sent Nina before she 
   died was a photo showing a paw print of a Tasmanian Tiger. The 
   Tasmanian locals don't take too kindly to the foursome's sudden 
   appearance (and the fact that troublemaker Jack punctures the tire of 
   a local's car for no apparent reason at all), especially when they 
   announce they are lo<A HREF="dying_breed_2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dying breed dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>oking
    for a tiger. It could be because most of the locals are descendants 
   of prisoners who were sent to the island when it was a penal colony 
   from 1788 to 1868; it's most famous prisoner being cannibal Alexander 
   &quot;The Pieman&quot; Pierce (Peter Docker), who escaped from the 
   prison into the woods and was never heard from again (A flashback in 
   the beginning of the film shows Pierce taking a bite out of a prison 
   guard's neck and tossing the bit of bloody flesh to a hungry 
   Tasmanian Tiger.). After a memorable night in town, where someone 
   keys Jack's new truck and Jack beats up a local for spying on him and 
   Rebecca making love, the foursome heads to the area in the photo that 
   Nina has, first by boat and then on foot. It's apparent that they are 
   not alone in the woods, but the question soon becomes: Do the 
   foursome have any right to be in these woods, especially the jackass 
   Jack, who brings a crossbow on what is supposed to be a photographic 
   hunt? Jack really is a first-degree prick, as he uses the crossbow to 
   kill a helpless rabbit and then skins it in front of Nina, who is an 
   animal rights activist. Rebecca is the first to die when some 
   grunting feral man bites off her fingers, snaps her neck and then 
   chews off her face. The appearance of a small girl in the woods (who 
   looks at a photo of Nina's sister and says &quot;Mama!&quot;), leads 
   to Nina and Matt joining two local hunters to search for Rebecca and 
   Jack (who disappeared while looking for Rebecca). When Jack is found 
   and they discover the shack owned by twin brothers Harvey and Rowan 
   (both portrayed by Bille Brown), Harvey being the &quot;normal&quot; 
   one and Rowan the deformed one (they are the incestual descendants of 
   Alexander Pierce), our trio finds out what generations of inbreeding 
   hath wrought: Two cannibal brothers that raped Nina's sister eight 
   years earlier, resulting in a baby girl. Is history about to repeat 
   itself, only this time with Nina as the unwilling sperm 
   receptacle?&nbsp; This Australian production, the feature debut of 
   director Jody Dwyer (who co-wrote the screenplay with producers 
   Michael Boughen and Rod Morris), is nothing more than an updating of 
   Jeff Lieberman's <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#JustBeforeDawn1980">JUST
    BEFORE DAWN</A></B> (1980) with an added subplot about the search 
   for a Tasmanian Tiger. Although it take a while for the film to find 
   its pulse (it crams way too many different storylines in the first 
   hour, including the search for the tiger, Nina's nightmares about her 
   sister, the townies' incestuous secrets and Jack's generally 
   assholiness), once the foursome actually get in the woods, the flick 
   starts delivering the gruesome goods, including cannibalism (the 
   sight of Rebecca's body hanging in Harvey/Rowan's backyard is an 
   image you won't soon forget); a crossbow bolt shot through Harvey's 
   cheek and pinning him to a tree; Jack stepping on a bear trap and 
   then falling head-first onto another one; a hunter getting his head 
   cleaved in two by a machete; a pickaxe through Rowan's heart and 
   other gory mayhem. If I have one big problem with <B><A HREF="dying_breed_2008b.htm">DYING
    BREED</A></B>, it's that it drops the Tasmanian Tiger hunt to focus 
   on the human hunt and then returns to the tiger in a quick, two 
   second shot that closes the film. I would have liked to have seen 
   more of the tiger and a lot less of Jack's annoying habits. Also 
   starring Ken Radley, Elaine Hudson, Sheridan Harvey and Boris Brkic.

    and the story itself is rather boring. It tries to be different by 
   mixing religion and cannibalism, but it comes off rather hollow. The 
   film begins in Niagra Falls, where a native-looking fellow fires a 
   blowgun dart in to another man's throat and he dies instantly. The 
   film then switches over to New York City (most of the best Italian 
   gore films start out here, including Lucio Fulci's <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Zombie">ZOMBIE</A></B>

   fellow kills two more men with his blowgun before he is run over by a 
   truck when trying to escape. The police are able to ascertain that 
   the darts were dipped in cobra venom and the killer had a roll of 8mm 
   film on his person. They show the footage (where a man has his back 
   pierced by two hooks and he is then attached to a swing-like device; 
   a tip of the hat to <B><A HREF="man_called_horse_1970.htm">A MAN

    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> - 1980). Sheila, who is an heiress to an 
   Alabama cotton mill plantation (!), is able to identify her sister 
   Diana (Paola Senatore; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#KillerReserved9Seat">THE
    KILLER RESERVED NINE SEATS</A></B> - 1974) in the footage. She 
   disappeared six months earlier when she joined a religious cult run

   Italian cannibal genre), who now runs his &quot;Purification

   Jonas: &quot;A first-class nut. Dope fiend probably.&quot;).&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After Sheila talks to Professor Carter (a glorified cameo by Mel 
   Ferrer; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#City Walking Dead">CITY OF THE 
   WALKING DEAD</A></B> - 1980) to get more information on Jonas and his 
   jungle camp, she hires drunken Vietnam War deserter Mark Butler 
   (Robert Kerman, who also starred in <B><A HREF="cannibal_holocaust_1980.htm">CANNIBAL
    HOLOCAUST</A></B>, as well as starring in hundreds of porno films 
   using the name &quot;Richard Bolla&quot;) to guide her through the 
   jungles of New Guinea (for $20,000 cash and another $80,000 when her 
   sister comes home). While in the jungle, the native guides are 
   attacked by a tribe of cannibals, who hack away at their bodies and 
   chow down on their arms and legs (all in loving close-up). Mark and 
   Sheila make it to the camp, where they are introduced to Jonas, who 
   keeps his brethren in line by making them drink a drugged liquid. 
   Sheila finally meets Diana (Sheila: &quot;She looks different. I can 
   hardly recognize her.&quot; Mark: &quot;She's stoned out of her 
   mind!&quot;) and Sheila talks her into escaping the camp, but it is 
   surrounded by the same tribe of cannibals, making escape nearly 
   impossible. Nearly. Unfortunately, Sheila becomes hooked on Jonas' 
   spiked cocktail and Jonas tests her devotion to him by raping her 
   with a dildo dipped in cobra blood!. He also paints her nude body 
   gold for reasons only known to Jonas. Mark tries to escape on his 
   own, but when he spies the cannibal tribe cutting off the penis of 
   one of their own and eating it (!), he goes back to the camp and begs 
   Jonas to forgive him. Jonas is not buying it (and rightfully so), so 
   he has Mark tied-up in the jungle sun. A member of the flock frees 
   Mark from his binds and begs him to let him go with Mark when they 
   try to escape. Mark tells Sheila not to drink any more of the drugged 
   liquid, but she's hooked. Mark and Diana have to bound and gag Sheila 
   so she doesn't warn Jonas that they are escaping. Sheila's actions 
   cause the death of Diana (the cannibals cut off her left breast and 
   leg and eat them; they then cut her stomach open and feast on her 
   innards!) and when Sheila sees what's left of her sister (her severed 
   head lying on the ground), she snaps out of her drugged stupor. 
   Helicopters sent by Professor Carter pick up Sheila and Mark just 
   before they are about to become cannibal chow, while Jonas makes his 
   flock drink cobra venom (it tastes worst than Kool-Aid judging by the 
   looks on the flock's faces!), causing a mass suicide back at 
   Purification Village. Back in New York City, Sheila listens in her 
   hospital bed as a news crew talk about the mass suicide and how 
   Jonas' body has yet to be discovered. Mark never gets his $80,000 
   because Diana gave her fortune away to Jonas, meaning Sheila is 
   penniless. The film ends on that note.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While the film is gory as hell (besides what I have mentioned, you 
   will see the cannibals chewing on human ears and nipples!) and full 
   of full-frontal female nudity, it's the real-life animal violence 
   that is a constant turn-off for me (Much of the footage of animal 
   killings was lifted from Umberto Lenzi's <B><A HREF="man_from_deep_river_1972.htm">THE
    MAN FROM DEEP RIVER</A></B> [a.k.a. <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Sacrifice!1972">SACRIFICE!</A></B> 
   - 1972]). We watch as the cannibals slice the throat of a baby 
   alligator and then slice open its stomach, while the alligator 
   twitches in pain. I know some people are able to overlook this, but I 
   can't. If you can fake human deaths, you can damn well fake animal 
   deaths. Also on view are a mongoose attacking a cobra (mongeese are 
   immune to cobra venom); a snake swallowing a monkey and a large 
   lizard being skinned alive. The Italian's favorite drink, a bottle of 
   J &amp; B Scotch, also makes an appearance here. Director Umberto 
   Lenzi, who passed away in October of 2017, has made much more 
   entertaining films than this, including the brutal <B><A HREF="action.htm#Almost Human">ALMOST

   the first time I actually witnessed fast-moving zombies, which would 
   become commonplace years later). Lenzi was also responsible for what 
   many consider the ultimate Italian cannibal gore film, <B><A HREF="cannibal_ferox_1981.htm">CANNIBAL
    FEROX</A></B> (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="make_them_die_slowly_1981.htm">MAKE
    THEM DIE SLOWLY</A></B> - 1981), but, it too, wallows in real-life 
   animal killings. So much so, that I refuse to watch it again, even 
   though I own the stunning Grindhouse Releasing Blu-Ray set. <B><A HREF="eaten_alive_1980.htm">EATEN

   was the title Continental Video was going to release it theatrically, 
   but they went out of business before they could do so. Everyone but 
   Mel Ferrer was dubbed, even though it is plain to see that all were 
   speaking English. The voices for Sheila and Diana are a ridiculous, 
   exaggerated Southern twang, as if all people from Alabama talk like 
   this (they don't). The Blu-Ray from Severin Films is above reproach. 
   The film is crystal clear and the extras, including a feature-length 
   documentary of &quot;Queen Of The Cannibal Films&quot; Me Me Lai (<B><A HREF="crucible_of_terror_1971.htm">CRUCIBLE
    OF TERROR</A></B> - 1971; who appears here as &quot;Mowara&quot; a 
   native girl whose husband committed suicide, so she is fucked by her 
   husband's three brothers, a native ritual as a way of saying 
   goodbye!) and an interview with Lenzi (among others) and a CD of the 
   motion picture soundtrack (music by Carlo Maria Cordio, listed in the 
   credits as &quot;Budy-Magliony&quot;) make this a must-own 
   collection, even if the film is not so memorable (If you want to see 
   a real sleazy Jim Jones-like film, I would recommend the Mexican-made <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#GuyanaCrimeCentury">GUYANA:

   shows Times Square as I remembered and loved it. We see billboards

   one of the films being <B><A HREF="cry_rape_1970.htm">CRY RAPE</A></B>

   the nostalgia factor that compelled me to watch this film again after 
   I long decided never to watch it again. Other people may be more 
   forgiving, but not me. Animal killing for entertainment purposes is

   (2010) -</B> At this point in my life, I'm sick to death of zombie 
   films. Ever since the gory (but nonsensical) <B><A HREF="walking_dead_tv_series.htm">THE
    WALKING DEAD</A></B> began to pull in huge numbers on TV, there has 
   been a glut (and that's putting it politely) of low-budget zombie 
   flicks. You can't turn around without some DVD company releasing a 
   new zombie film and this has been going on for years now. I decided 
   to give this one a try since it was made in Italy by Italians and 
   because I'm a fan of most Pastaland genre films, I was hoping that 
   this one would be different. Sadly, it isn't. It is most defininitely 
   a reworking of George Romero's <B><A HREF="day_of_the_dead.htm">DAY 
   OF THE DEAD</A></B> (1985), except for a couple of original ideas. 
   The film opens by laying the groundwork for the premise. During the 
   opening credits, we see several TV anchors telling the viewing public 
   (or what is left of them) that a mysterious plague has ravaged our 
   planet causing the dead to come back to life, with over 600 million 
   reported deaths (so far); we have reached the day when not one baby 
   has been born (the plague hits the female population very hard); 
   Neo-Nazi skinheads have taken over several countries (which I find 
   hard to believe, even in this scenario); governments around the world 
   are creating &quot;extermination camps&quot; where they kill the 
   infected and the walking dead by shooting them in the head; and even 
   the Pope has taken his own life by putting a bullet in his brainpan, 
   leaving a note saying that he &quot;doesn't want to come back&quot; 
   (I guess the cardinal sin of suicide no longer applies when the world 
   is in<A HREF="eaters_2010.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/eaters dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   turmoil. You would think it would be the exact opposite.). We then 
   travel a few years ahead, where zombies outnumber the living, as we 
   witness the lives of two mercenary-type survivors, Igor (Alex 
   Lucchesi) and Alen (Guglielmo Favilla), who are working with 
   scientist Gyno (Claudio Marmugi) and other survivors in a compound 
   that is protected by an electrified fence. Gyno is trying to find a 
   cure for the plague (At least that is what he is saying, but he seems 
   to enjoy his job a little too much), while every once in a while Igor 
   and Alen leave the safety of the compound to look for survivors, food 
   and supply Gyno with zombies to experiment on (Sound familiar?). Gyno 
   has a wide area fitted with hidden cameras, so he can secretly watch 
   what is going on, not just in the compound, but also in &quot;Sector 
   B&quot;, a town that he seems to hold a lot of interest in. Igor is 
   the more gung-ho of the duo and Alen is the more level-headed one, 
   but they get along like good friends, ribbing each other as often as 
   they can, while killing zombies that try to take bites out of them. 
   Alen also has fiancee Alexis (Roselli Elmi) in an electrified cage, 
   as flashbacks show she volunteered to use an experimental serum to 
   get her pregnant (no human babies have been born for years and 
   finding an uninfected female is nearly impossible), but it seems she 
   became infected with the plague and did not turn into a zombie, 
   something Gyno seems to find very interesting. Alen believes that 
   Alexis may be the answer to ending the plague, but no one else seems 
   to agree with him (Gyno has more nefarious plans for her). We watch 
   as two compound employees seem to enjoy using a female zombie (who is 
   missing her lower half and tied to a wall) as target practice, 
   something both Alen and Igor find disgusting. Humanity is becoming 
   worse than the zombies (Sound familiar?). The remainder of the film 
   is really nothing but a showcase for finding ways to kill zombies in 
   gory ways; such as a zombie stripper still in her dance outfit; a 
   mechanic Alen once knew who is run over by their Jeep and cut in 
   half, a painter that likes to draw the severed heads of zombies in 
   exchange for cans of beer, and so on. We also witness a band of 
   Neo-Nazis (the head of the band is called &quot;Fuhrer&quot; [Fabiano 
   Lioi]) as they turn killing zombies into a deadly game: Participants 
   are given one bullet in their weapons to kill an approaching zombie 
   and if they don't shoot them in the head, they get eaten. We also 
   watch as Gyno lets all his zombies go free in the compound (He kept 
   them docile by letting them watch TV, the only instance in the film 
   that holds any Romero-type social commentary) and concentrates on 
   Alexis. While Igor and Alen are out of the compound, the freed 
   zombies begin chowing-down on the only humans left in the now-unsafe 
   compound (the two assholes who used the female zombie as target 
   practice get nice, juicy deaths). Alen becomes disenchanted with life 
   when he discovers Patient X, the original spreader of the plague 
   (played by Steve Sylvester, who also supplied some songs to the 
   soundtrack), is nothing but a female-hating wannabe-priest who took 
   joy is spreading the disease (Alen puts a bullet in his head), but 
   when Igor discovers an uninfected female by the name of Cristina 
   (Elsa Ferretti), Alan regains his faith in humanity. For some reason 
   the zombies kidnap Cristina but don't eat her, which causes both Alen 
   and Igor (who may have been infected) to go to Sector B, where they 
   discover that some zombies can talk and are becoming organized. It 
   seems that Gyno knew this all the time (thanks to his experiments and 
   watching them on his hidden cameras) and he is using Alexis to give 
   birth of the first zombie baby, in hopes of creating a new living 
   dead society, which he calls &quot;a continuation of our 
   species&quot;, that will replace humans on Earth. Will Gyno succeed 
   in his plan? (Nope) Will Alen &amp; Alexis reunite? (Nope) Will I 
   ever watch another zombie film again? (Yeah, probably)&nbsp; It took 
   two directors, Marco Ristori &amp; Luca Boni, to make this film 
   (Ristori also co-wrote the screenplay with Germano Tarricone), and 
   Uwe Boll (<B><A HREF="rampage_2009.htm">RAMPAGE</A></B> - 2009) is 
   the Presenter of the film, even though he really had nothing to do 
   with the making of it (He gets a &quot;Very Special Thanks&quot; in 
   the closing credits). I don't know why the directors thought they 
   needed Boll's name above the title since a lot of people consider him 
   a hack (Personally, I don't. I think he has made some very 
   entertaining and socially relevant films in the past few years), but 
   Boll then did take an active producing role in their next three films 
   as directing partners: <B><A HREF="zombie_massacre_2013.htm">ZOMBIE MASSACRE</A></B> 
   (2013); <B><A HREF="morning_star_2014.htm">MORNING STAR</A></B> 
   (2014) and <B><A HREF="zombie_massacre_2_reich_of_the_dead_2015.htm">ZOMBIE
    MASSACRE 2: REICH OF THE DEAD</A></B> (2015). Although <B><A HREF="eaters_2010b.htm">EATERS</A></B> 
   has it's share of very gory moments, such as watching a zombie eating 
   his own guts, various living dead makeups that are quite effective as 
   they eat humans like they would a pizza, and some bloody head shots, 
   some scenes are enhanced with quite noticable CGI, including blood 
   spurts and a particularly hoary explosion in the finale. The film 
   also dates itself by mentioning that Osama Bin Laden has never been 
   caught. Since this takes place in the future, it's a mistake that 
   should have been fixed in post-production (I know it was made in 2010 
   before Bin Laden was shot and killed, but the DVD was not released in 
   the U.S. until 2013). The DVD offers you two choices to watch this 
   film: In Italian with English subtitles (the preferred method) or 
   English-dubbed. Be aware that the dubbed version contains some 
   cringe-worthy dialogue, such as when Igor makes a promise to Alen and 
   Alen replies, &quot;Swear on that worm between your legs!&quot; The 
   film does have some funny incidental scenes, such as Igor reading the 
   real magazine &quot;<A HREF="girls_and_corpses_magazine.htm">Girls 
   And Corpses</A>&quot; (a zine I never understood the allure for, but 
   to each their own) and some other quick flashes that I'll leave for 
   you to discover if you decide to watch this film. It is by no means 
   the worst zombie film I have seen, but that should not be considered 
   a ringing endorsement. I will say this: It was photographed a lot 
   better (by Paco Ferrari) than most low-budget films and does have a 
   sense of danger at every turn, but in the end, the film doesn't add 
   up to much and leaves it wide-open for a sequel (which hasn't 
   happened yet). Proceed at your own risk. Also starring Paolo Spartaco 
   Palazzi, Roberto Mariotti, Riccardo Floris, Matteo Cantu and 
   Francesco Malcom. An E One Entertainment DVD Release. <B>Not Rated</B>.

    in it's original aspect ratio</A> on U.S. home video for the very 
   first time and I have to say for all the inherent flaws in the print 
   (emulsion scratches, speckling of dirt), it has never looked better. 
   It actually made me appreciate the film a lot more than I did when 
   watching all those muddy PD fullscreen prints that have been floating 
   around for years. After opening with the standard horror scrawl 
   &quot;This Film Is Based On A True Story&quot; (yeah, right), we are 
   introduced to art restorer Danila (Stella Carnacina; <B><A HREF="no_way_out_1973.htm">NO
    WAY OUT</A></B> - 1973) and her boyfriend Carlo (Gianrico 
   Tondinelli) as they head to a closed-down deconsecrated church to 
   meet one of her professors to look for statues to buy (besides being 
   an art restorer, Danila is also an expert on statues). In Carlo 
   words, they look at some &quot;moldy old statues&quot;, and one in 
   particular catches Danila's eye immediately: A statue of a strange 
   man crucified on a cross. The seller tells her that last year a 
   female tourist took one look at that statue, screamed out that it was 
   &quot;the work of the Devil&quot; and ran away. Danila asks the 
   seller why this church was deconsecrated and he replies that a 
   century earlier, some of the church's members were caught holding 
   &quot;satanic orgies&quot;, so the church was shut down and 
   deconsecrated. The Professor buys the statue based on Danila's 
   expertise and they take it back to the restoration room at the 
   University (Danila rides in the back of the truck to makes sure the 
   statue doesn't slip off and we can see that the statue is affecting 
   her somehow). Back at the University, they remove the life-sized 
   figure from the cross and notice that it was carved out of a single 
   piece of olive wood (Carlo says, &quot;It's almost like he was born 
   inside the tree.&quot;). That night, Danila goes to a party thrown by 
   her parents, Mario (Chris Avram; <B><A HREF="bay_of_blood_1971.htm">A 
   BAY OF BLOOD</A></B> - 1971) and Luisa (Lucretia Love; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#KillerReserved9Seat">THE
    KILLER RESERVED NINE SEATS</A></B> - 1974), where people dance to 
   Hammond organ-heavy instrumental pop music. While Mario is playing 
   cards with some friends, Luisa and her secret nameless lover 
   (Gabriele Tinti; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Endgame">ENDGAME</A></B> 
   - 1983) sneak into one of the bedrooms for some hanky panky. We then 
   see Luisa totally nude on the bed while her lover throws rose petals 
   on her body and then begins whipping her body with the thorny rose 
   stems, cutting up her breasts and torso. And she likes it! Danila 
   spies on them going at it through the venetian blinds and then leaves 
   the party in disgust, heading back to the University to continue 
   restoring a painting. While she is working on the painting, the 
   wooden figure behind her comes to life (in the visage of genre actor 
   Ivan Rassimov; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Humanoid1979">THE HUMANOID</A></B> 
   - 1979), whom we soon find out is good old Satan himself!&nbsp; He 
   strips Danila naked (with one yank of her clothes!) and makes violent 
   love to her on a table, while fire and brimstone twirl around them 
   (including the cross he was crucified on catching on fire). We then 
   see Danila's eyes, as she is continuing to restore the painting. Was 
   what just happened all in her head? Don't bet on it. Danila tells 
   Chris what she just experienced, so they decide to move in together, 
   but first Chris has to go to her parents house to get their blessing, 
   so he doesn't come off as &quot;irresponsible&quot;. Danila goes back 
   to her apartment to pick up some things, but as she is walking up the 
   swirling staircase to get to her apartment, she hears footsteps 
   behind her and then a chorus of people chanting some satanic verse. 
   She is overcome with sexual desire and starts moaning loudly while 
   touching herself. When Danila's parents arrive and notice her 
   pocketbook outside her apartment door, they let themselves in, only 
   to discover Danila masturbating wildly in her own bed, scratching her 
   torso with her own fingernails (Luisa immediately thinks back to when 
   her lover whipped her with the rose stems). While Luisa leaves the 
   bedroom to call a doctor, Mario asks his daughter, &quot;Did it 
   hurt?&quot;, to which she replies, &quot;I nearly died of 
   pleasure!&quot; and tries to get Daddy into some incest action. Mario 
   slaps her senseless and when the doctor arrives, he sedates Danila, 
   telling her parents that the cause of her bizarre behavior is 
   probably due to the stress of her job and what she really needs is 
   some quiet time in the country (Where can I find a doctor like 
   this?). Danila's parents drive her and Chris to their country estate 
   (While in the car, Danila, Chris and Mario have a mind-boggling 
   discussion about bridges and Mario's profession as an architect, 
   where he says that he designs houses &quot;on a planned economic 
   program and are designed for a very specified socio-economic 
   need.&quot; WTF?!?), while Luisa acts disinterested and distant. They 
   get a flat tire and, while Chris and Mario change the tire, Danila 
   goes exploring and discovers an old building. The caretaker explains 
   to her that it was once an Etruscan Temple to the god Ba'al and tells 
   her she is welcome to explore. While she is walking through one of 
   the building's many underground tunnels, she watches as a satanic 
   ritual takes place, where a naked woman is on an altar and Satan 
   himself make an appearance. Satan crucifies Danila by driving spikes 
   through her hands and feet on a wooden cross (the only real gory 
   sequence in the entire film). Danila screams, only to discover that 
   she is in bed in the country estate. Was all that just happened in 
   her head? Don't bet on it. Mario discovers the scratches on Luisa's 
   torso and accuses her of &quot;masochistic tomfoolery&quot;. He tells 
   Luisa that he would rather see Danila dead than have her turn into a 
   whore like her mother. When the doctor notices signs of the stigmata 
   on Danila's hands and feet, he calls in a psychiatrist and other 
   professionals. They notice that all signs of the stigmata are 
   suddenly gone, so they recommend that Danila go through an exorcism 
   so it will convince her psychologically that she is cured. What they 
   don't realize is that she is actually possessed. Luisa talks to 
   Reverend Antonio (Piero Gerhini; <B><A HREF="convoy_busters_1978.htm">CONVOY
    BUSTERS</A></B> - 1978), who assures her that an exorcism is nothing 
   to be taken lightly and insists on seeing Danila before he agrees 
   that an exorcism is needed. As soon as Reverend Antonio steps into 
   Mario &amp; Luisa's country home, Danila begins screaming and banging 
   her noggin on the headboard of her bed. After just seeing this, the 
   Reverend believes an exorcism is in order (Really? For screaming and 
   repeatedly banging her head? She could at least spider-walked down 
   the stairs or rotated her head 360&#176;.) and has Danila taken to 
   the Convent Of Our Lady Of Sorrow to prepare her for the exorcism. 
   The Reverend pulls Father Xeno (Luigi Pistilli; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#MilanoCalibro9">MILANO
    CALIBRO 9</A></B> - 1972) out of retirement to perform the exorcism, 
   but Father Xeno is well aware before the Reverend and Chris arrive at 
   his doorstep that the Devil is afoot (he is already dressed in his 
   &quot;exorcism&quot; outfit). Before he can perform the exorcism, 
   they must catch Danila, who has torn the metal grate off her window 
   and has escaped into town, banging on all the doors with her 
   blood-soaked hands. They manage to catch her, but Father Xeno's first 
   try at exorcising Danila turns out badly, as the <A HREF="eerie_midnight_horror_show_1974_blu-ray.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/eerie midnight horror show blu-ray front8a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="256" HEIGHT="307" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>good
    Father Xeno nearly succumbs to Danila's sexual charms. He goes back 
   to his room for some self-flagellation to cure him of such sexual 
   desires. The next time he tries, it becomes much more physical, but 
   not in a sexual way. Danila rips off several links of a big-ass chain 
   and begins to whip Father Xeno with it while he speaks the words of 
   exorcism. Danila froths at the mouth and then begins to throw-up 
   green chunks of something. We then see Chris touch Danila's face, 
   which now looks possession-free and the film freezes at that frame 
   while the end credits roll. There is a lot to dislike about this 
   film, especially the direction of hack Italian exploitation 
   specialist Mario Gariazzo, best known on U.S. shores as &quot;Roy 
   Garrett&quot;, who directed such films as the average

   passed away in 2002). Bad direction and makeup effects aside (This 
   film's idea of showing Danila possessed is to blacken her eyes and 
   give her severely chapped lips!), screenwriter Ambrogio Molteni (with 
   additional dialogue supplied by overseas dubbing artist supreme Ted 
   Rusoff) does have a germ of an idea that nearly succeeds, but the 
   lack of support from the director (In his defense, the disjointed 
   feel of the film may have something to do with the way it was edited 
   to achieve an R-Rating in the States, such as Luisa's lover 
   reappearing two-thirds into the film and threatening her life. We 
   then never see him again.) and the almost total lack of any 
   substantial gore nearly does the film in. Nearly. The ample 
   full-frontal nudity and horrendous dubbing, as well as some highly 
   atmospheric sequences (the statue first coming to life; the Etruscan 
   Temple ritual), will keep your mind fully occupied, as you'll be 
   wondering half the time what in the hell these people are talking 
   about. Some of the things that come out of their mouths 
   matter-of-factly will make you rewind the Blu-Ray to make sure you 
   heard it right. And you probably did. While there are far better

   better unless some other company decides to do a major restoration on

   Submitted for your approval...oops! Wrong anthology. While Rod 
   Serling is the (offscreen) narrator of this low-budget supernatural 
   anthology film, he had nothing to do with the script of any of these 
   three tales and we are all worse off for it. The film opens with an 
   on-screen crawl (narrated by someone other than Serling) that states 
   that between the years of 1949 to 1970, a certain Dr. Jonathan Rankin 
   (who never existed) documented 453 cases of the paranormal and 
   discovered that the 453 people involved in those cases are buried in 
   only 23 cemeteries. These cases have been dubbed the &quot;Rankin 
   Cluster Phenomena&quot; and the stories that follow are taken from 
   those case files (Yeah, right!). The first story is about a trio of 
   friends playing pool who send a horny geek to the house of a girl of 
   ill repute. Problem is, they send him to the wrong address and he 
   ends up getting accidentally shot dead by the old woman who lives 
   there. At the cemetery, the dead geek's mother puts a curse on the 
   three friends and tells them every seven days one of them will die a 
   horrible death. After one friend is killed when he is hit with a car, 
   the second friend hops on a plane on the 14th day after the funeral 
   and ends up sitting next to a priest. He tells the whole story to the 
   priest, but the priest tells him it was just a coincidence and God 
   will protect him. When<A HREF="encounter_with_the_unknown_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/encounter with the unknown vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   the priest disembarks the plane at his stop, the plane crashes on 
   takeoff, killing the second friend. When the priest (who now believes 
   the story) tries to warn the third and final friend on the 21st day, 
   he's too late. He went skydiving. The second story is about a young 
   boy who loses his dog and discovers a mysterious hole in the middle 
   of a field. Spooky sounds eminate from the hole, so some townspeople 
   go to investigate and disagree with each other about what could be in 
   the hole. The people lower the boy's father down the hole, he screams 
   (and a photo of him falls off the wall at home, breaking in front of 
   his wife) and when they pull him up, he's nothing but but a babbling 
   insane idiot who is eventually committed to an asylum for the rest of 
   his life. That's the (w)hole story. The third tale is about a Senator 
   and his wife who stop at a bridge to give a girl a lift (All she says 
   is, &quot;Take me home!&quot;), only to later discover that she is a 
   ghost who died when her car went over the bridge many years earlier. 
   It's an old urban legend told many times before (and much better than 
   this). The finale recaps all three stories (again!) in painstaking 
   detail, as the offscreen narrator (again, not Serling) tries to find 
   a rational supernatural explanation for each story. He fails 
   miserably and the viewer suffers in ways that would make a hooker 
   blush.&nbsp; The best way to simply describe this film is awful. 
   Amateurish in nearly aspect, from the acting, the photography, the 
   library music score and, especially, the direction by Harry Thomason, 
   who also gave us <B><A HREF="so_sad_about_gloria_1973.htm">SO SAD

    OF EVIL</A></B>) and <B><A HREF="day_it_came_to_earth_1977.htm">THE 
   DAY IT CAME TO EARTH</A></B> (1977), among others. While the second 
   tale (about the hole in the ground) does have some creepy moments (it 
   reminded me a little bit of <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Pit">THE PIT</A></B> 
   - 1981), the rest of the film is pretty rough going for the viewer. 
   It's endlessly talky and padded out with scenes of people walking or 
   running through fields, cars driving down roads and nature scenes. 
   The third tale is especially superfluous, as it insists on giving us 
   the complete backstory of the ghostly girl on the bridge. All that 
   information (including an achingly-long love ballad that plays while 
   scenes of the girl and her boyfriend frolic in a field) kills any 
   supernatural interest the story holds. We all know how that story 
   ends anyway. This segment never seems to end. The most painful part, 
   though, is the finale, which condenses the previous 75 minutes and 
   explains to us what we just saw for another 15 minutes (!), while the 
   narrator prattles on-and-on, spouting supernatural mumbo-jumbo. It's 
   rather obvious that this was tacked-on to further pad-out the film's 
   running time to feature length. For Rod Serling completists only, 
   although I believe that Harry Thomason must have had something to 
   hold over Serling's head (Maybe some incriminating photos?) to get 
   him to narrate a turd like this. Speaking of Thomason, he later 
   became a successful TV producer with his wife Linda 
   Bloodworth-Thomason (<B><A HREF="designing_women_tv_series_1986-1993.htm">DESIGNING

   1985) stars as Bold Cheung, a poor fat slob who prides himself on his 
   bravery, when in fact he's scared all the time (even when he sleeps, 
   he dreams about two angry ghosts who chase him and take bites out of 
   his flesh). One day, a friend of Cheung's (who has a nasty mole on 
   the side of his nose that sprouts a huge hair!) challenges him to a 
   game of &quot;Peel Apple&quot;, where Cheung must peel an apple in 
   front of a mirror without breaking the skin. If the skin isn't in one 
   piece when he is done peeling, bad supernatural things will happen to 
   him (Those crazy Chinese and their even crazier superstitions!). 
   Cheung reluctantly agrees to the challenge and that night begins 
   peeling an apple alone in front of a mirror at his friend's house, 
   unaware that his friends have tricked-out the house in an elaborate 
   practical joke in an attempt to get Cheung to break the skin. Cheung 
   does <A HREF="encounters_of_the_spooky_kind_1980.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/encounters of the spooky kind british dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>just
    that; he breaks the skin and actually unleashes a female ghost with 
   a horribly burned face and extremely long arms, who pulls Cheung's 
   mole-faced friend into the mirror and tries to do the same to Cheung, 
   but he cuts-off one of her hands and pins it to the floor with a 
   knife. Cheung returns home and nearly catches his wife cheating on 
   him with his boss, Master Tam (Wong Ha). Master Tam wants Cheung 
   dead, so he has his underling, Lau (Cheung Ti-Hong), hire an expert 
   in witchcraft, Chin Hoi (Chan Lung), to kill Cheung using his 
   supernatural powers. Using Cheung's claim to being the bravest man in 
   town, a deadly trap is set when Cheung is challenged to spend the 
   night in a haunted temple. Cheung gets some unexpected help from Tsui 
   (Fat Chung), an associate of Chin Hoi who doesn't believe in using 
   witchcraft to do harm, especially death. Cheung is locked in the 
   temple and must follow Tsui's instructions to the letter if he is to 
   survive the night. The night includes reanimated corpses, hopping 
   vampires and several close calls, but Cheung escapes with his life, 
   only to let his damned pride make him accept another bet to spend 
   another night in the temple for 50 pieces of silver. Cheung once 
   again gets some help from Tsui to combat Chin Hoi's magic spells, but 
   when one of the counterspells fails to work, Cheung will have to use 
   his martial arts skills to battle a hopping vampire, defeating it and 
   putting Chin Hoi in traction. Cheung returns home to find a pool of 
   blood on the floor and his wife missing. He is arrested and 
   imprisoned for his wife's murder (even though her body is not found), 
   where he learns that he's to be beheaded the following morning! 
   Cheung breaks out of prison and joins forces with Tsui, where they 
   fight Chin Hoi in the finale to a battle of witchcraft, which 
   includes zombies, tiger fighters and Cheung transforming into a 
   fighting Monkey God (complete with monkey sound effects!).&nbsp; Full 
   of Samo Hung's patented broad humor and kung fu skills (the man may 
   be fat, but he can move as quickly and agilely as a man half his 
   size), as well as some gruesome makeup effects and gravity-defying 
   wire work, <B><A HREF="encounters_of_the_spooky_kind_1980b.htm">ENCOUNTERS

   and countless copycats) is engrossing and sometimes hilarious hybrid 
   of martial arts and horror genres. Samo Hung's much put-upon Cheung 
   is a comical everyman whose only sin is his vanity. He's says he's 
   afraid of nothing (the opposite is true) and he suffers greatly for 
   that sin. Not only does he have to fight reanimated corpses, ghosts 
   and hopping vampires sent upon him by Chin Hoi, he must also suffer 
   the indignities of a cheating wife and a boss who would rather have 
   him dead than find out. This leads to a series of comical martial 
   arts fights, including one where Cheung fights everyone in a 
   restaurant with a possessed left arm. Some of the art direction is 
   truly inspired, especially in the haunted temple, and the weird 
   visuals on view, including the sight of a naked Cheung painted 
   head-to-toe with protective spells, makes this film a sure bet for 
   fans of Hong Kong weirdness. The closing shot, between Cheung and his 
   unfaithful wife, is one of the most audacious conclusions of any film 
   I have seen in recent memory. You'll either be cheering Cheung on or 
   making a call to a battered wife helpline reporting a serious crime.

   Something strange is happening in the Montreal subway system and only 
   nurse Karen (Ilona Elkin) seems to be picking up on it. The hospital 
   she works at has seen an upswing in crazy people screaming about 
   &quot;demons&quot; (one intern comments that there's a full moon 
   tonight and an eclipse is about to happen in a couple of hours as 
   well), but when one of Karen's patients, Viviane (Christine Lan), 
   commits suicide by jumping in front of a subway train after seeing 
   one of the demons (A man whose mouth has been fused shut with maggots 
   and worms) and leaves Karen an envelope containing drawings depicting 
   demons at the hospital and subway, Karen heads down to the subway to 
   investigate. After nearly getting robbed and raped by scumbag Patrick 
   (Robin Wilcock) on the platform, Karen is saved by good guy Mike 
   (Nicolas Wright) and they board the train. This is when things get 
   extremely weird. The train grounds to a complete stop and Mike is 
   stabbed in the back by seemingly normal middle-aged Betty (Joan 
   McBride), who is suddenly brandishing a knife in the shape of a 
   crucifix after she receives a message on her pager. As a matter of 
   fact, many people on the train receive the exact same message on 
   their pagers and they all begin pulling the same type crucifix knife 
   out of their matching satchels and start stabbing and slicing the 
   rest of the passengers <A HREF="end_of_the_line_2006b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/end of the line 2007 poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="189" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>while
    muttering &quot;God is love!&quot; or &quot;God loves you!&quot; 
   over and over. It seems all these psychos are under the control of 
   some cult-like figurehead called the &quot;Reverend&quot; (David L. 
   McCallum; who, up to this point, we only see on poster and pamphlet 
   covers strewn throughout the hospital and subway system), who leads a 
   doomsday group called &quot;Voice Of Eternal&quot; and tonight's the 
   night that the Reverend's prophecy is fulfilled. A bunch of 
   survivors, including Karen, Mike, Neil (Neil Napier), John (Tim 
   Rozon), Sarah (Nina M. Fillis), Julie (Emily Shelton), Davis (Danny 
   Blanco Hall) and Frankie (John Vamvas), escape into the subway 
   tunnels and temporarily hide in a workers break room, where they 
   discover all TV and radio signals are blocked (every channel on TV 
   has a blood-red liquid flowing on-screen). Everyone except Davis and 
   Frankie (who are subway workers) leave the break room and head 
   through the tunnels in hopes of reaching the freedom of outside, but 
   the will have to run a gauntlet, which includes a gang of possessed 
   young children (one of whom gets a crowbar planted in his head); that 
   scumbag Patrick, who nearly rapes both Karen and Julie; and a horde 
   of the Reverend's unholy rollers. When the Reverend makes an 
   appearance on TV and pleads to all his followers to continue the 
   killings to &quot;save all their souls&quot;, things get even 
   weirder. By the end of the film, all of the non-believers have 
   split-up and gone their separate ways looking for ways out of the 
   subway while being chased by different factions of the Reverend's 
   followers. Just as it all seems hopeless, all the pagers go off again 
   with another message and all of the Reverend's followers, with the 
   exception of Patrick, stop their killing and swallow cyanide 
   capsules. Is the Apocalypse truly upon us? You'll have to watch the 
   movie to find out.&nbsp; This is a tight, suspenseful thriller that 
   greatly benefits from not playing its entire hand too soon. 
   Director/producer/screenwriter Maurice Devereaux, who previously gave 
   us the awful <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Blood Symbol">BLOOD SYMBOL</A></B> 
   (1984/1991) and the decent <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Slashers">SLASHERS</A></B> 
   (2001), brings his &quot;A&quot; Game here, as there are scenes on 
   view that will send chills down your spine. One such scene is when 
   the religious fanatics, led by Betty, tells Frankie to kill his 
   pregnant wife Brenda (Lori Graham), but when he refuses, Brenda stabs 
   him instead and then the fanatics take turns stabbing Brenda, 
   removing her unborn baby from the womb and placing it between Frankie 
   and Brenda's bodies. Once you witness this atrocity, you will not 
   soon forget it. Devereaux keeps the viewer on their toes throughout, 
   as we are never really certain of the extent of this apocalypse (Is 
   it confined to the subway or is it global, as the Reverend would have 
   us believe?) and who among the cast is part of the conspiracy. I 
   won't reveal the ending here, because it will ruin your enjoyment of 
   what precedes it. The film is bloody as hell, with multiple 
   stabbings, slit throats, a nasty axe to the head, near-decapitation 
   by sword, a lower lip bitten off and other gory mayhem, yet there is 
   no gunplay at all, which is totally refreshing. The standout here is 
   Robin Wilcock as the rape-happy Patrick, who is willing to go against 
   the Reverend's puritanical wishes just to get some pussy and when he 
   reveals later in the film that he's still a virgin, it brings new 
   layers to the evil he causes. <B><A HREF="end_of_the_line_2006.htm">END

    ETERNAL EVIL OF ASIA</A><A NAME="EternalEvilOfAsia"></A> (1995) -</B> 
   Crazy Hong Kong horror film about hexes and enchantments. We are 
   first informed about how the bodies of recently deceased children are 
   used to carry out hexes (apparently, dead children like to go to the 
   movies, so if one asks you to take him/her to the bathroom in the 
   middle of watching a film, you will more than likely not come back 
   alive!). The film then switches to a father who is yelling at his son 
   for eating too much Cup O' Noodles (&quot;Don't you know they kill 
   you!&quot;). We then see a mysterious man walking down an alley 
   (stray cats explode as he walks by!) carrying a voodoo doll with the 
   father's photo on it. The father, who has just buried his elderly 
   parents, gets a phone call from his mother and father telling him 
   that it's cold where they are. As the mysterious man throws dirt on 
   and then pierces the voodoo doll's head with a needle, the father 
   sees his dead parents in the apartment and hacks away at them with a 
   meat cleaver, not knowing he is actually killing his wife and son 
   (and two neighbors who show up at his door to complain about the 
   noise). When the doll is set on fire, the father falls off his 
   terrace and is impaled on some flourescent l<A HREF="eternal_evil_of_asia_1995.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/eternal evil of asia dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="174" HEIGHT="246" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ight
    tubes below. We then view a bunch of chatty women at a hair salon 
   talking about marriage, sex and enchantments. The mysterious man has 
   put a hex (using another voodoo doll) on May's (Ellen Chan) 
   boyfriend, Bon (Chan Kwok-Bong), and when they have sex later that 
   night, Bon is unable to perform (He hits himself in the crotch and 
   screams, &quot;My little dick!&quot;). After some supernatural, 
   ghostly stuff happens at the salon, May goes to a good witch, who 
   believes all this bad luck is related to a trip her boyfriend took to 
   Thailand a few weeks earlier with three of his friends (the father 
   who took a header off the terrace was a member of that party). The 
   good witch puts an enchanted worm into May's body for protection 
   (don't ask) and tells her to find out exactly what happened on that 
   Thailand trip.&nbsp; May confronts Bon (who is visited by the ghost 
   of the dead father, who has flashing flourescent tubes protruding out 
   of his body) and he reluctantly tells her the truth. It seems that 
   when they were in Thailand, Bon and his three friends visited a 
   whorehouse, got into trouble (a hooker in the whorehouse screams out, 
   &quot;I've got AIDS!&quot;), ended up lost in the woods and happened 
   upon the mysterious man's house, who turns out to be a wizard. Things 
   rapidly go downhill from there. It involves sex slaves, competing 
   wizards, lots of ooze, some wirework stunts and a love potion that 
   ends up it the wrong hands.&nbsp; Things pick up considerably in this 
   Cat III film once Bon relates his Thailand flashback. Some of the 
   surreal scenes include: The wizard turning the head of Kong (Elvis 
   Tsui) into a giant penis, complete with piss squirting out of the top 
   when he gets nervous (One of his friends says, &quot;You are an ugly 
   dickhead!&quot;); Two competing male/female wizards who fly through 
   the air while fucking doggie-style; A cursed friend turns into a 
   cannibal in a busy restaurant (he bites off the hand of a female 
   patron), which results in him eating his own left arm before he dies; 
   and many more outrageous scenes. As with many of the Cat III titles 
   of the time (the equivalent of an NC-17 rating in our country), there 
   is plenty of nudity and sex to go along with the violence, but some 
   of the sex scenes seem edited, especially the scene of Bon's three 
   friends raping the wizard's sister (it's really not their fault, 
   since the sister meant the love potion to be delivered to Bon, but 
   his three friends receive it instead), which is the reason why the 
   wizard (who looks like Jet Li's twin brother) is killing the four 
   friends. Director Chin Man Kei (<B><A HREF="sex_and_zen_2_1996.htm">SEX

   to watch one that's a throwback to 70's &amp; 80's Hong Kong horror 
   cinema, with a modern sexual twist (wait until you witness the 
   invisible fellatio scene!). Worth your time. Also starring Lily 
   Chung, Ben Ng, Julie Lee, Bobby Au Yeung, Ng Shui Ting, Yuen King Tan 
   and Baat Leung Gam. Available on DVD by <A HREF="http://www.taiseng.com">Tai
    Seng Video Marketing</A> with burned-in Mandarin and English 
   subtitles, some of the translations being extremely funny. I 
   especially liked when the Thai wizard called Bon and his three

   been a major subject in horror films since the days of the silents, 
   but the 70's turned out some very good (if not great) ones, including <B><A HREF="legend_of_hell_house_1973.htm">THE

    AMITYVILLE HORROR</A></B> (1979); and many more. More than most of 
   them have been a doorway to Hell which is blocked by a religious 
   object or person, who sometimes win and sometimes fail spectacularly. 
   Well, I'm glad to report that this Roger Corman-financed film (he's 
   an uncredited Executive Producer) manages to work all of those ideas 
   into a scant 89 minutes and it is gory (but, sadly, no nudity) as the 
   70's would allow an R-Rated film. The film opens as caretaker Sam (Ed 
   Bakey) enters the cursed &quot;Vargas House&quot; and mumbles to 
   himself how rumors of death to those who broke in have occurred 
   there. He is preparing the house for a new couple (more on them 
   later) and goes down to the basement to clean the boiler which, by 
   the looks of it, hasn't been used in 100 years. Suddenly, the boiler 
   shoots out a large plume of fire and Sam is engulfed in flames, 
   running aimlessly for his life. Cut to Professor C. J. Arnold 
   (Richard Crenna (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DeathShip1980">DEATH SHIP</A></B> 
   - 1980), a college professor who has no room for God in his life 
   because he only believes in the tangibles, and his wife Dr. Caroline 
   Arnold (Joanna Pettet; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#DoubleExposure1982">DOUBLE
    EXPOSURE</A></B> - 1982), who will soon prove has powers that her 
   husband will put his life on the line for.<A HREF="evil_1977.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/evil-eaten alive ad mat8a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="234" HEIGHT="340" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   They are being shown the &quot;Vargas House&quot; by a Realtor (the 
   late Milton Selzer), who explains the whole sordid history of the 
   house (it hasn't been occupied for the last hundred years since Dr. 
   Vargas died and no one wants to live in it; one time the city council 
   voted to tear it down but changed their minds) and since C.J. doesn't 
   believe in curses or such things, he immediately accepts the offer to 
   buy the house. As soon as Caroline enters the door, she sees a 
   specter (turns out it is the spirit of Dr. Vargas), who points her to 
   a plaque outside which says: &quot;Disturb not he who is held in here 
   with chains.&quot; Since Caroline knows her husband won't believe 
   her, she keeps what she has seen and read to herself. The Professor 
   and his wife are soon joined by a few of their friends: Professor 
   Raymond Guy (Andrew Prine; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Barn Naked Dead">BARN
    OF THE NAKED DEAD</A></B> - 1974), who is much more down to Earth 
   and is willing to believe anything (within reason); his not-so-secret 
   squeeze Laurie Belman (Mary Louise Weller); Pete Brooks (George 
   O'Hanlon Jr.); Felicia Allen (Lynne Moody); Mary Harper (Cassie 
   Yates) and her dog Kaiser; and handyman Dwight (Robert Viharo; <B><A HREF="bare_knuckles_1977.htm">BARE
    KNUCKLES</A></B> - 1977; here billed as &quot;George Viharo&quot;). 
   It's not soon after everyone is in the house that the supernatural 
   fun begins. When one of the girls finds herself trapped in the air, 
   hanging by a cable, Dwight offers to help, only to have an electric 
   cable fall from the ceiling, wrap around his neck and electrocute 
   him. Kaiser starts acting strange and runs to hide in the house; when 
   he is found by Mary, he attacks her and seriously punctures her neck. 
   Two of the girls find the toasted body of Sam when they check the box 
   of a dumbwaiter and he comes rolling out. But the real fun starts 
   when C.J. goes down to the basement and finds a hidden door in the 
   floor with an iron cross across the handles protecting whatever is 
   inside from coming out. C.J. pulls out the cross and is then called 
   by his wife to come upstairs to see something. It is then, as soon as 
   C.J. leaves the basement, that the door bursts open and the house 
   starts to shake like it was hit by an earthquake. All the window 
   shutters and doors close (most of the windows have bars on them, so 
   there is no escape from them) and no matter how hard they try, there 
   is no way out of the house. Felicia is attacked by an invisible 
   force, who tosses her around like a ragdoll and tears off all her 
   clothes except for her bra and panties, all while an unseen voice 
   cackles with delight. When C.J. and Pete find a way to escape from an 
   upper floor, they use some cable to try and lower Pete down, but the 
   cable becomes too hot and Pete catches on fire and falls to his death 
   (Fire plays an important part in the plot, which everyone will soon 
   find out). Raymond nearly cuts off his hand with a portable circular 
   saw when he is possessed and Mary is pushed off a stairway balcony by 
   Kaiser, where she and the dog die on the hard floor below. Pretty 
   soon no one but C.J. and Caroline are left (You didn't think I was 
   going to tell you how everyone died did you? OK, just one more: 
   Raymond dives through an unshuttered, unbarred window and screams 
   &quot;I'm free!&quot;, but he ends up sinking to his death in a pit 
   of quicksand where the plaque stands. The window then becomes whole 
   again [thanks to reverse photography] like nothing happened.) and 
   they have to go into the open door in the floor in the basement to 
   face whatever is down there. Turns out it is The Devil himself 
   (played very creepily by the late Victor Buono; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Moonchild1972">MOONCHILD</A></B> 
   - 1972), who is trapped in an all-white room, and he decides to have 
   some fun with C.J. because of his disbelief in Heaven and Hell. He 
   encourages C.J. to yell out God's name to see if he will give him any 
   help, but before C.J. gets the chance to, Caroline plants the iron 
   cross into The Devil's chest, just long enough for them to get away 
   (The Devil pulls out the cross and throws it in their direction. 
   Stupid move, Satan!). Caroline and C.J. manage to make it to the 
   basement and close the door, sealing it with the iron cross. The 
   world is safe once again from the Devil's Doorway to Earth. All the 
   doors and windows open, allowing C.J. and Caroline to leave the 
   house, and C.J. finally sees the specter of Dr. Vargas, who was a 
   good spirit all along. Maybe C.J.'s views of Heaven and Hell will 
   change in the next semester he teaches. Director Gus Trikonis (<B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#SwingingBarmaids">THE

   films, TV movies and TV series episodes until he suddenly stopped in 
   2001), who was married to actress Goldie Hawn from 1969 to 1974, 
   delivers an pretty good horror film from what is obviously a low 
   budget (I'm sure the lion's share went to Richard Crenna's paycheck). 
   There are plenty of scares and inventive deaths (late actor Galen 
   Thompson [who appears here as the specter of Dr. Vargas] co-wrote the 
   screenplay [with Trikonis] using the pseudonym &quot;Donald G. 
   Thompson&quot;, the same name he used to write the screenplay to the 
   eerily similar <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Superstition1982">SUPERSTITION</A></B> 
   in 1982, even using a circular saw blade gag). It's hard to believe 
   that some TV showings of this film completely edited out Victor 
   Buono's appearance. He is very effective here and downright 
   believable as The Devil (His delivery of some of his dialogue will 
   send chills down your spine). Maybe network execs were afraid that 
   the film would make children afraid of the Devil (well, duh!). 
   Cutting out Buono's performance is like cutting Marlon's Brando's in <B><A HREF="apocalypse_now_1979.htm">APOCALYPSE

   cracked over the head with a baseball bat at a local baseball game. 
   Weller gets pissed off because he specifically said &quot;no local

   (Marcus Wyatt) from a gas station and his worried father Daley (Tal

   (Robert Z'Dar) to start searching for his son. When local hunter Stu

   undying loyalty. The sheriff delivers Troy and the Collector's body 
   to Weller, who performs a ritual and brings the Collector back to 
   life. Daley begins asking questions in town and the only person who 
   will talk to him is Josh (Jack Vogel), Teri's brother. It seems Teri 
   is a virgin and will be Weller's 103rd sacrifice when the time is 
   right. The Collector appears to Teri one night (he pulls the bullet 
   she shot out of his heart in front of her) and tells her that she'll 
   be next. She then begins to see him everywhere; on the street, in her 
   bedroom and even on the TV. No one will believe her except Josh, who 
   knows something has been very wrong in this town since his and Teri's 
   mother was killed and their father's bimbo mistress moved in the very 
   next day (all thanks to Weller's satanic powers). When a magical 
   floating baseball (!) crashes through Teri's bedroom window one 
   night, destroys her room and nearly kills her, Teri, Josh and 
   girlfriend Lisa (Connie Lolan) douse the Collector with gasoline and 
   set him on fire. The sheriff shows up and Josh realizes that they are 
   on their own. When Teri is kidnapped by Weller, Josh, Lisa and Daley 
   team up to rescue Teri and Troy. They are too late to save Troy 
   (which only makes Daley more pissed), so they raid Weller's house and 
   must fight Weller's supernatural powers as well as the sheriff and 
   his itchy trigger finger. Can the forces of good defeat the powers of 
   evil? Prepare yourself for one head-scratcher of an ending.&nbsp; I 
   really don't know what to make of this weird little horror film. 
   Stuntman-turned-director Jim Winburn (<B><A HREF="death_merchant_1991.htm">THE
    DEATH MERCHANT</A></B> - 1991) has crafted a tale of small town 
   horror, but there is precious little back story to go along with the 
   horror. My biggest question is this: Since it's quite apparent that 
   Reed Weller has the power to perform many supernatural acts (like 
   raise the dead and grant the townspeople's wishes), why does he need 
   to kill 103 kids? How much power does one person need? The film's 
   heart is in the right place, though (screenplay by Brent Friedman, 
   Scott Rose and John Geilfuss), as big Bill Smith (with satanic 
   symbols tattoed on his bald head) is effective as Weller, Pepper 
   Martin (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Scream 1981">SCREAM</A></B> - 
   1981) is creepy as the Collector and some scenes are inventive (Stu's 
   death after disobeying Weller is one such scene, as well as when 
   Daley realizes that he has to kill his son to find peace). There's a 
   lot to like here (it's not very gory, but it is very violent), but I 
   wish there were more motivations behind the killings. It would have 
   added a little meat to go along with the potatoes. This film is 
   usually rated as a bomb (or lower) by nearly every reviewer I have 
   read. Either I watched this while I was having a very good night or I 
   managed to look past some of the mistakes (the boom mike in the 
   frame, flubbed lines, etc.) and chose to enjoy it as an atmospheric 
   little chiller. Nothing special, mind you, just enjoyable. Also

   this one dealing with supernatural possession. A bulldozer in a 
   quarry unearths a huge stone tablet with ancient writing on it that 
   is covering a deep shaft. When the tablet is lifted by the quarry 
   crew, revealing the shaft, a surge of electrical energy shoots out of 
   it, which seems to affect Master Cheung (Lar Kar Leung) clear across 
   town. He walks home and pulls a bow and three magical arrows from 
   under his bed and then mutters, &quot;It has been 50 years that you 
   finally appear!&quot; He treks over to the quarry and a flashback 
   reveals how fifty years earlier, he and his father trapped a demon 
   known as Evil Cat down the shaft, but Cheung had to kill his father 
   in the process. With his dying breath, his father warns him that 
   &quot;this possessed cat has nine lives&quot; and it has already been 
   defeated eight times by members of his family every fifty years for 
   the past four hundred years. It is now Master Cheung's turn to fight

   medical records, he is dying from cancer and only has a short time to 
   live. We then switch over to the highrise building which houses the 
   Fan Holding Company. It seems Evil Cat has taken up residence in the 
   building, killing multiple security guards and personnel before 
   possessing the body of the business's millionaire owner, Mr. Fan 
   (Stuart Ong). Master Cheung, with the help of Mr. Fan's limo driver,

    Cat (Cheung gives Long a magical necklace, but tells him to throw it 
   away if he's still alive in seven days). Inspector Wu (Wong Ching, 
   who also wrote the screenplay), is assigned to investigate the 
   slaughter at the highrise and is happy to find female TV reporter Siu 
   Chen (Tang Lai Ying) is already on the scene, since he has a huge 
   crush on her. As luck would have it, Siu Chen is the daughter of 
   Master Cheung, but when she sees her father at the crime scene, she 
   doesn't believe his story and threatens to send him to a sanitarium 
   for his final days (What a bitch!). She doesn't believe in spirits or 
   evil and thinks her father is an old, superstitious fool. Mr. Fan 
   begins acting strange, ordering his staff at home (including Long) to 
   go to bed early and not to disturb him after midnight. Long gets 
   hungry late that night and goes to the kitchen, only to spot Mr. Fan 
   outside with his face immersed in the coy pond. When Mr. Fan comes up 
   for air and has a live fish in his mouth (!), he spots Long and 
   attacks him, which leads to a wild car ride to Long's mother's house. 
   His Mom fights off Evil Cat/Mr. Fan by throwing a statue of Buddha at 
   him (!) and Long goes to Master Cheung, who is now staying at Siu 
   Chen's home, for help. Siu Chen thinks Long is as crazy as her 
   father, but even she will soon come to believe as more murders take 
   place. Cheung kills Mr. Fan with one of the magical arrows but is 
   stopped from finishing off Evil Cat when Inspector Wu intervenes. 
   Evil Cat has now jumped into the body of Mr. Fan's sexy mistress, 
   Tina (Tsiu Suk Woon), and it's very, very, pissed.&nbsp; This wild 
   horror film contains many action-packed and gory set-pieces but, 
   thankfully, doesn't take itself too seriously. Where director Dennis 
   Yu's <B>THE BEASTS</B> was a relentlessly grim rape/revenge 
   exploitationer (with hardcore sex inserts), he gives <B><A HREF="evil_cat_1987b.htm">EVIL
    CAT</A></B> a much lighter tone, but doesn't sacrifice shocks or 
   gore in the process. The relationship between Master Cheung and Long 
   is a delight, especially the sequence where Cheung tries to teach an 
   impatient Long how to gain magical powers and Long tries to cheat at 
   every opportunity, usually with disasterous results. There are many 
   &quot;out-there&quot; scenes, including the car ride, a sequence 
   where Mr. Fan traps Long in his office and the rape/possession of 
   Tina, but they all take a backseat to the amazing final twenty 
   minutes, when Tina/Evil Cat lays waste to an entire police station, 
   where she/it decapitates cops by swatting at their heads, thrusts her 
   hands through bodies, tosses people around like they are ragdolls, 
   detaches her own arms to strangle Master Cheung (who is at least 50 
   feet away from her!), all while taking multiple bullet hits to her 
   head and body. It's guaranteed to get your heart racing. But, until 
   then, there's plenty of carnage to keep you happy, including 
   impalements, limb removal, a tongue biting and a comical case of mass 
   vomiting. If there are any complaints about this film, it's that Wong 
   Ching's portrayal of Inspector Wu is a little too broad for my tastes 
   (How did a buffoon like this become an Inspector?), the English 
   subtitles leave a lot to be desired and the final shot defies the 
   legend of Evil Cat that was explained in the beginning (Cats don't 
   have ten lives). Don't let these minor quibbles stop you from seeing 
   this, though. It's a wonderful piece of Hong Kong horror/action

   followed them. He tells the couple that the Alps are evil and things 
   are more dangerous than they seem. Cindy and Tony tell him to get 
   lost, so he wishes them nothing but fun and leaves. Tony and Cindy go 
   hiking in the woods, whistling a Snow White tune (!), when Cindy is 
   nearly crushed by a falling tree. They stop at a stream to get some 
   water (Camping without water?) and they see Arva is there. She 
   invites them to stay at her house and they stupidly agree. We then 
   see something is following them (more Stedicam work) and when Cindy 
   feels it, Arva says don't worry, it's nothing. We also see that 
   Algernoon is following them. After a long trek, they arrive at Arva's 
   house (the shack we saw at the beginning of the film). The shack is 
   surrounded by ruins and Arva tells them that there's a secret tunnel 
   in the ruins that leads to a fresh water spring. Is this important?

   ruins and a mysterious flammable liquid (<B>Tony:</B> &quot;What's

    I could go on detailing what happens next, but it is obvious 
   director/screenwriter Andreas Marfori (<B><A HREF="soviet_zombie_invasion_2016.htm">SOVIET
    ZOMBIE INVASION</A></B> - 2016) has seen both <B><A HREF="evil_dead_1983.htm">THE
    EVIL DEAD</A></B> - 1981 and <B><A HREF="demons_1985.htm">DEMONS</A></B> 
   (1985) one too many times. Like the former, it shows the evil in the 
   woods as a fast-moving POV, as the camera moves quickly through the 
   forest (While Sam Raimi and friends achieved this look using a 
   makeshift Stedicam by attaching their camera to a 2X4, this film 
   looks like it is using the real thing). Like the latter, the makeup 
   of the demon Fango (a transformed young man in overalls from the 
   beginning of the film) is strikingly similar to Lamberto Bava's film. 
   Sadly, nothing here makes a lick of sense. It's like suffering 
   through a fever dream, as the film is nothing but a collection of 
   gore scenes, none of them connected to each other. We see Fango use 
   Cindy for fishing practice, as he grabs a fishing pole and hooks her 
   on her face, but the next scene shows her face untouched. Cindy even 
   uses a chainsaw on Fango, but the next scene shows Fango whole again. 
   It's sloppiness like this that makes the film a tough slog (at least 
   for me) to finish. People get decapitated, lose their limbs (and 
   manhood), Tony has his hands crushed by Fango and other bloody 
   hijinks, all of it extremely gory and well done, but good gore 
   without a coherent story does not make a good film. When Cindy yells, 
   &quot;Is there an end to all of this?&quot;, you'll be wondering the 
   same thing, as it runs an extremely long 86 minutes, proving that 
   gore without story is boring (at least to me, but gorehounds will 
   probably disagree). Shot as <B><A HREF="evil_clutch_1988_foreign_ads.htm">IL

   he blew his head off by sticking a hand grenade in his mouth! Our new 
   editor doesn&#146;t particularly enjoy the job but, because he needs 
   the money, agrees to edit the 8-part series. After viewing scene upon 
   scene of hacked-off limbs and bloody murders, Ed begins to 
   hallucinate various graphic acts, such as cutting into an arm when he 
   is actually slicing a loaf of bread and viewing a grotesque 
   vulgarity-spewing monster in his refrigerator. Ed starts killing for 
   real and likes it, so he starts murdering anyone he can get his hands 
   on. Neck snappings, beheadings, electrocutions and a skull split down 
   the middle follow. One wonders what director/screenwriter/photographer/editor
    Anders Jacobsson was trying to say here. Does he believe that 
   watching violence causes violent behavior or is it his way of making 
   fun of this controversial issue? I tend to lean towards the latter 
   but I&#146;ll bet that some anti-violence media whores will view this 
   as a documentary of our society today. Available in Unrated and 
   R-rated versions, you should probably avoid the R-rated cut as it 
   excises all the bloody deaths that Ed is supposed to be editing out 
   of the films. Maybe Ed edited the R-rated version as it destroys any 
   impact that the film has in the first place. Ironic isn&#146;t it?

   is offed with a power drill (off-screen), a couple having sex are

   College student Mark (Daniel Gillies) is doing his thesis on myths

   (Clayne Crawford), as well as lesbian lover friends Kristy (Estella 
   Warren) and Sharon (Ashley Scott), along with him to the Bryce 
   property to help him document his thesis with video and sound. As 
   soon as they set foot on the property, the three brothers investigate 
   the inside of the house, while Kristy and Sharon walk through the 
   woods surrounding the house. From the moment they step into the 
   house, the brothers begin to hear voices and creaking floorboards and 
   Tyler photographs a figure in a dog skull mask on his Polaroid camera 
   in the basement. Eric ends up missing, so Mark and Tyler head to the 
   attic after witnessing one of the bedroom walls seeping blood. They 
   find Eric hanging upside down, his throat slashed and tied to boards 
   like an upside down Jesus on the cross. Paranoia quickly begins 
   setting in both Mark and Tyler, who blame each other for Eric's death 
   and there's talk about Tyler murdering their abusive father when they 
   were kids. Meanwhile, Kristy and Sharon find a whole bunch of animal 
   traps littering the woods (Kristy frees a rabbit caught in one) and 
   Sharon accidentally steps on one, injuring her foot.&nbsp; Kristy 
   uses a tree branch to set off every trap she finds and, as she 
   disables the final one while heading back to the house with a limping 
   Sharon, Tyler is killed in the attic when he walks directly into a 
   giant bear trap that impales his body from head to toe. Mark is then 
   chased throughout the house by Carl and as Mark makes it out the 
   front door, Kristy and Sharon see him pulled inside by the dog skull 
   masked killer. Kristy and Sharon then fall into a trap next to the 
   house and are locked inside it by Carl. Kristy is able to loosen some 
   bars that lead to a tunnel to the house's basement, as they both 
   become more and more paranoid (especially Sharon, who I wanted to 
   kick in the face). Sharon is killed by Carl and Kristy is chased 
   through the woods, finally making it to freedom when a tractor 
   trailer hits Carl and splatters him into a million pieces. Four years 
   later, a girl interviews Dr. Rosen about Kristy, who now permanently 
   resides in a mental institution, convicted of killing all her friends 
   when no trace of Karl can be found on the truck that hit him. Dr.

   Louisiana scenery and a cheap jump scare here and there. All the 
   characters are terribly underwritten, so we really feel nothing for 
   them when they die. The only interesting thing about this film 
   (besides Kurtwood Smith, who is listed in the opening credits, but 
   not the closing ones) is the insane music that plays over the closing 
   credits. It's genuinely creepy, something which the rest of the film 
   tried to achieve, but failed miserably. Although the film is not 
   terribly acted, there is almost a total lack of blood (except for the 
   bedroom wall, the sight of a murdered Eric and the stabbing death of 
   a welder who calls the police for Kristy). Why bother making a stalk 
   'n' slash flick and be stingy on the slash? I can't in good 
   conscience recommend this film. It's not terrible, just boringly 
   ordinary. Also starring Brandon Martin, Rusty Tennant and Jeff Galpin

    and extremely boring. The majority of the film concerns the creepy 
   isolated burg of Smalltown (the sign on the way into town reads 
   &quot;Population: 666 Elevation: 13&quot;, just so we know it's 
   creepy), which seems to be populated only by senior citizens. We soon 
   find out that when any young people (including kids) stray into town, 
   they are knocked-out and sent to a clinic run by Dr. Schaeffer (Dean 
   Jagger, who was called &quot;Dr. Shagetz&quot; in the original edit), 
   who uses their youth to keep the elderly population immortal. Trouble 
   arises when a camper containing Christopher (James Keach), wife Linda 
   (Doria Cook), friend Mike (Robert Walker Jr.) and girlfriend Julie 
   (Michele Marsh) breaks down as they enter Smalltown. Instead of 
   spending the night in the house of &quot;kindly&quot; old Lyle (Dabbs 
   Greer) and his wife (Lurene Tuttle), the quartet decide to camp out 
   in the woods, making it more difficult for the old geezers to kidnap 
   them. Every few minutes, the newly-shot (and badly-matched) footage 
   intrudes on the proceedings, showing Harry and Wally kidnapping some 
   necking couples (including a lesbian couple), bringing the men to Dr. 
   Schaeffer's clinic and saving the women for themselves, restraining 
   and raping them in their garage (Harry says to Wally, after they have 
   raped one girl, &quot;Don't say a word about her!&quot; Wally 
   replies, &quot;I won't. Cross my legs!&quot;). When the old cronies 
   discover that the camping foursome are moving to L.A. (for some 
   reason that's a bad thing in their eyes), they make sure that the 
   camper is permanently disabled. Christopher, who is moving to L.A. to 
   start his medical residency, becomes mighty suspicious of the town's 
   old farts, especially when he sees the white-haired population 
   carrying Mike and Julie's drugged bodies to Dr. Schaeffer's clinic. 
   Christopher and Linda are eventually captured and brought to Dr. 
   Schaeffer, who shows Christopher his operation and asks him to 
   carry-on with his experiments in perfecting the immortality serum. 
   After seeing a cage full of Dr. Schaeffer's failed experiments (a 
   gaggle of young people in straitjackets and acting crazy), 
   Christopher gives his answer by strangling Dr. Schaeffer with his 
   bare hands, grabbing Linda (Mike and Julie are dead) and setting the 
   clinic on fire.&nbsp; This patchwork film fails to register, thanks 
   to the obvious inserts (the film stock, fashions and dialogue just 
   don't gel with the old footage) and boring nature of the reworked

   idea previously in <B>EVILS OF THE NIGHT</B>, was trying to pull a 
   fast one on VHS renters during the release-anything 80's but, 
   unfortunately, he forgot the golden rule. If you want to pull a fast 
   one on us (especially with the misleading VHS cover art), at least 
   have the courtesy to throw a little bloody violence into the new 
   footage (the nearest he comes to it is when a clinic escapee gets 
   into a martial arts fight with an orderly!). The closest this film 
   come to violence is when James Keach punches-out a couple of

    FANGLYS</A><A NAME="Fanglys"></A> (2003) -</B> Ultra-low-budget 
   regional horror film (filmed in and around Justin, Texas), reportedly 
   made for less than $2,500 and it shows. As with a lot of these 
   no-budgeters, it takes place during Halloween and concerns itself 
   about a local legend; a family of cannibals called the Fanglys, who 
   haunt the woods around Storm Creek during the candy-giving holiday, 
   slaughtering those who dare enter their territory. The young adults 
   in the area don't take the legend too seriously and use it as a rite 
   of passage to haze the non-believers, but Sheriff Pete (Burton 
   Gilliam; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#TerrorWithin2">THE TERROR 
   WITHIN II</A></B> - 1990) knows that the legend is real and has been 
   covering-up the Fanglys murderous doings for many years, especially 
   the killings performed by witch matriarch Fanglady (played by Justin 
   Hamilton in drag) and her retarded son Chubb (director/scripter 
   Christopher Abram, acting under the name &quot;J. Christopher&quot;). 
   A group of obnoxious twenty-somethings, including Mark (Robert 
   Harvey), his wife Kelly (Laurie Reaves), perpetual coward Jerry (Tim 
   Boswell), prankster Steven (Josh Gobin) and <A HREF="fanglys_2003.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/fanglys dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="189" HEIGHT="263" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>new
    girlfriend Camille (Natalie Woods), think it would be a good idea to 
   party in the cemetery of Storm Creek on Halloween Night (yeah, none 
   of them are the sharpest tools in the shed). They build a campfire in 
   the middle of the cemetery using wooden grave markers as firewood 
   (again, these are studid people) and Kelly tells ghost stories about 
   Fanglady stealing the lifeforce of her victims and Chubb taking the 
   lifeless corpses and skinning them (which we are barely shown in 
   flashbacks), which scares the crap out of Jerry and new-to-town 
   Camille (hint, hint). I guess we all know what happens next. After 
   Steven steals more wooden grave markers to add to the campfire (he 
   deserves to die just for doing that), they are discovered by Chubb, 
   who disables their car (and steals a porno DVD from the back seat!) 
   when he notices the grave markers missing in the cemetery (he uses 
   the graveyard to bury the bones of Mommy's victims). Camille ends up 
   missing, Chubb knocks-out Steven and then terrorizes the rest, 
   eventually kidnapping Kelly. Mark comes to the rescue, only to 
   discover that Camille is actually a Fangly's family member, but he 
   manages to kill Chubb (after the retarded Chubb accidentally kills 
   Camille with a pitchfork) and Fanglady before he, Kelly and Steve 
   escape. They then learn from Sheriff Pete that the Fanglys can never 
   truly be killed and they will surely rise from the dead next 
   Halloween.&nbsp; This is a terribly slow moving horror flick that has 
   very little (if anything) going in its favor. It's poorly acted (the 
   only professional here is Burton Gilliam, who looks embarrassed), 
   talky as hell and contains nearly no gore, which, considering the 
   subject matter, was a very poor decision. It's hard to determine if 
   director/writer/actor/editor/dishwasher Christopher Abram (<B><A HREF="after_sundown_2005.htm">AFTER
    SUNDOWN</A></B> - 2005; <B><A HREF="by_the_devil's_hands_2008.htm">BY
    THE DEVIL'S HANDS</A></B> - 2008) purposely set out to make a campy 
   film, but it's difficult to take this as a serious horror film. The 
   character of Chubb elicits laughs rather than gasps with his 
   oversized crooked (and obviously fake) upper teeth and he acts more 
   like a brainless moron than someone who is supposed to scare us. 
   Director Abram manages to break every cardinal rule of horror 
   filmmaking: He pulls back on every gore shot when he should be moving 
   in for the close-up (There's one maddening scene where Chubb 
   threatens a necking couple with a machete, but then tosses it to the 
   ground and snaps the man's neck with his bare hands instead! I swear, 
   I nearly stopped watching the film there and then, but I soldiered-on 
   in hopes that it would get better. It didn't.); he has the women keep 
   their bras and panties on during their sex scenes (Even when Chubb 
   rapes one of them in his bedroom!); and there's even a thing in a 
   cage that Chubb keeps as a pet, but we never see it! We are even led 
   to believe that Chubb kills Jerry (and, believe me, you'll want this 
   whiny shit dead as soon as you meet him), but if you survive through 
   the end credits, you'll learn that even he survives. What's the 
   point? No, really, will someone tell me why anyone would make a 
   horror film but leave out the horror? I've taken dumps that scared me 
   worse. Also starring John William Galt, Natali Jones, Jason Skeen and

    Love) is next to die, as the killer returns one of Joe's throws and 
   nails him through the torso (There goes our best suspect!). The 
   coaches and doctors are worried that three of their best athletes are 
   missing and again Diane wonders if the medications are involved 
   (&quot;Maybe they had adverse reactions.&quot;). Diane finds Annie 
   (Lynn Banashek) lying down in the middle of the hallway, screaming in 
   pain (from the medication) and Diane takes her home where we learn 
   that Diane's mother was an Olympic gold medal winner. Frank (Michael 
   O'Leary) breaks his leg dismounting off the parallel bars and, that 
   night, his girlfriend Lynn (Teal Roberts) is speared by the javelin 
   while doing laps in the pool. Dr. Jordine finds a team photo with all 
   the dead athletes x'ed out and suspects the other doctors and 
   coaches, since they are the only ones with keys to the office. Frank 
   begins snooping around and finds some incriminating evidence and 
   discovers all the dead bodies stuffed in lockers, but is 
   &quot;javelinized&quot; by the killer before he can tell anyone. 
   Annie is wounded by the killer, but boyfriend Phil (Sean Masterson) 
   saves her and brings her to Diane. Bad move. Turns out that Diane was 
   born a man and had a sex change operation, but lost her Olympic gold 
   medal (in the javelin throw) when drug tests proved she had too many 
   male hormones in her system. Now she's making all athletes pay.&nbsp; 
   Pretty blah as a mystery and a slasher film (a blind man could spot 
   the killer and there are only so many ways you can kill with a 
   javelin), the only redeeming quality this film has to is the constant 
   full frontal female nudity from nearly every female cast member 
   except, surprisingly, Sally Kirkland (who had many naked moments in 
   the vastly superior <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#In Heat Passion">IN THE

   has the emotional range of a piece of fruit and looks like she would 
   rather have a really painful bikini wax than be here. The gore is 
   practically non-existant, too. Just a few javelin impalements and 
   Kirkland's final fall onto a first place trophy (oh, the irony). 
   First (and only) time director Michael Elliot sure has a lot of 
   pretty girls in the cast (including blink-and-you'll-miss cameos from 
   Linnea Quigley as an athlete and Brinke Stevens as a naked shower 
   girl), but it's hard to believe that it took three people (Elliot,

   SOV (Shot On Video) flicks. Most of them are so cheap and boring, 
   they make Sunday School look appealing. This is one of the worst 
   examples of what was foisted onto unsuspecting renters looking for 
   something new during the video boon of the late 80's. The film opens 
   with a serial killer murdering an undercover female officer while 
   taking her picture in his photo studio. As the police close in, the 
   serial killer sits down in a director's chair, takes a self-portrait 
   of himself with a rare VDeluxe camera and then simply passes away, 
   pissing off the dead undercover cop's detective boyfriend. Ten years 
   later, a photographer named Amy (Lane Coyle) goes to a pawn shop 
   looking for some props for a photo shoot (the pawn shop looks like 
   someone's garage). The slimy pawn shop owner sells Amy the serial 
   killer's VDeluxe camera for fifty bucks and tells her that the camera 
   already &quot;has film in it. It always has film in it!&quot; Rather 
   than questioning him about that statement, Amy stupidly buys the 
   camera and takes a picture of a drunken bum as she is walking out of 
   the pawn shop. A short time later, the bum is slashed to death by the 
   seemingly-revived serial killer. It seems that whomever Amy shoots

   VDeluxe camera ends up dead by the serial killer's hands and when Amy 
   develops the photos, they show the people in their murdered states. 
   It takes Amy a few more murders to catch on as to what is happening 
   (she's not the sharpest tool in the shed) and the police detective 
   (the same one who's girlfriend was killed ten years earlier) begins 
   to notice striking similarities between the new wave of murders and 
   the killings ten years earlier. He's also got a new cop girlfriend 
   and, yep, you guessed it, Amy takes her picture with the damned 
   camera. Can Amy and the secretive Chan (don't ask) stop the serial 
   killer before he kills everyone who stopped for a photo op? Why does 
   the camera never run out of film? Do we really care? Did anyone see 
   my pants?&nbsp; As with most SOV features, the sound is bad, the 
   acting atrocious and the camerawork static. Director Dennis Devine, 
   who has unleashed other shitty SOV horror flicks to a rightfully 
   agitated audience, including <B><A HREF="hell_spa_1992.htm">HELL SPA</A></B>

   PIRATE DEATH</A></B> (2006), pads out this feature (I don't want to 
   call this a film because, let's face it, it's not) with long static 
   shots of people talking (the funniest being the two cops in a car in 
   the beginning of the film who, upon hearing that an undercover cop is 
   in trouble, take the time to buckle their seatbelts before starting 
   the car!) and POV shots of the serial killer stalking his victims. 
   The sets are cheap (the police detective has a poster of <B><A HREF="lethal_weapon_1987.htm">LETHAL
    WEAPON</A></B> (1987) hanging in his sparsely-decorated office) and 
   the violence is nothing more than splashing blood on victims, one 
   fake-looking arm being yanked-out of it's socket and the 
   after-effects of an offscreen decapitation (believe it or not, the 
   effects were supplied by Gabe Bartalos, who must have owed someone a

    Ahab (Adam Brooks) was convicted of murdering an innocent man he 
   thought was Chris Fuchman (pronounced &quot;Fuckman&quot;), a rapist 
   and serial killer of fathers. Fuchman (Mackenzie Murdock) raped and 
   murdered Ahab's father when he was just a kid and then sliced Ahab's 
   right eye with a box cutter (all shown lovingly in close-up) and 
   since then Ahab was on the search for the deadly serial killer. After 
   being set-up for murder and sent to jail, Ahab does his time and is 
   released from prison, where he goes into hiding at a cabin in the 
   woods, collecting toxic berries (don't ask) and making maple syrup 
   from trees that aren't maples (really, don't ask). Priest Father John 
   Sullivan (Matthew Kennedy) finds Ahab and talks him into coming back 
   to civilization. The raping and killing of fathers starts again as 
   soon as he is released from prison, so Detective Stegel (Brent Neale, 
   who talks and bears a resemblance to James Woods) thinks Ahab is 
   responsible. The latest victim is the father of male prostitute/thief 
   Twink (Conor Sweeney), who is fucked in the ass and then set on fire. 
   Twink joins Ahab and Father Sullivan to try and bring Fuchman down, 
   but first Ahab tries to talk his sister Chelsea (Amy Groening) into 
   leaving the strip club she works at and live a normal life. Chelsea 
   wants to join the trio in their pursuit of Fuchman (she has been 
   tracking his progress over the years in a journal she keeps), but 
   Ahab refuses. Fuchman tries to kidnap Chelsea after raping and 
   killing Twink's best friend Walnut (Garrett Hnatiuk) by biting his 
   dick off (it seems Walnut got several girls pregnant, which 
   technically makes him a father), but Ahab and his new-found friends 
   foil it. Fuchman finally kidnaps Chelsea at the strip club, killing 
   all the strippers (one has her head sliced in half with a chainsaw) 
   and the patrons. Ahab nearly dies after giving chase in a car to save 
   Chelsea (he is impaled on the tire iron he is carrying after falling 
   off Fuchman's truck) and Twink and Father Sullivan crash their car. 
   This leads to a night in the woods, where Twink and Father Sullivan 
   eats some of Ahab's toxic berries and trip out (it's one of the 
   film's funny highlights) and force feed Ahab some of the berries. The 
   berries heal Ahab and they end up at Fuchman's hideout (after the 
   film stops for a short fake commercial for a film to be shown later 
   that day, which ends with a hilarious stinger), where they find 
   Chelsea chained up and Fuchman on the run. Ahab kills Fuchman by 
   shotgunning him in the groin, stomping on his head and throwing him 
   off a dam wall, thereby ending the menace (there's a funny shot at 
   the end of this scene that involves a train coming out of a tunnel). 
   Do you really think it would be that easy? Father Sullivan finds a 
   book under the murdered Father O'Flynn's (Kevin Anderson) bed, which 
   details that the Fuchmanus is actually a demon reincarnated in Hell 
   after incest between a brother and sister that produces an offspring. 
   When Chelsea shows up at Ahab's motel room dressed scantily and 
   coming on to him, Ahab gives in and has sex with his sister 
   (cringeworthy to say the least). Chelsea is now in Hell (see if you 
   can spot the <B><A HREF="star_wars_1977.htm">STAR WARS</A></B> [1977] 
   homage) and the trio decide to kill themselves so they can go to Hell 
   and save her. Ahab and Twink end up in Hell, but Father Sullivan ends 
   up in Heaven, where he puts a gun to his angel guide's (Falcon Van<A HREF="fathers_day_2011b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/father's day blu-ray front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>

   head Lloyd Kaufman, who released this film on home video). Father 
   O'Flynn appears in God's office and forces him at gunpoint to send 
   Father Sullivan to Hell (since Father O'Flynn is blind, he really 
   doesn't know where to aim the gun, which leads to a bit of funny 
   dialogue by Kaufman). What happens next is best for the viewers to 
   discover, but I will say that the final stinger is funny as hell

   was a surprise to me from the start. It contains everything I usually 
   hate, including giving it that fake &quot;grindhouse&quot; look by 
   inserting emulsion scratches, some out of fucus photography and hairs 
   on the projector bulb, but this is a great way to spend 99 minutes if 
   you just want a good, old-fashioned 70's or 80's-like gore film with 
   a plot that is sometimes inventive and sometimes offensive. Nothing 
   is left to the imagination, including the aforementioned dick-biting, 
   gunshots to the head, bodies torn in half and many other bloody bits. 
   The comedy and acting are definitely hit-or miss, but that just adds 
   to its charm. Troma founders Kaufman and Michael Herz produced the 
   film and released it in a four disc limited edition Blu-Ray, 2 DVDs 
   &amp; a CD music soundtrack box set, with many extras (a Troma 
   trademark), including a couple of Astron-6 short films and liner 
   notes by acclaimed Canadian independent director Guy Maddin (<B><A HREF="saddest_music_in_the_world_2003.htm">THE
    SADDEST MUSIC IN THE WORLD</A></B> - 2003), who gets a

   most of the crap that Troma releases and it gets my highest

   must battle Andrew and his horde of the living dead for the souls of 
   every human being on Earth.&nbsp; The first film by a then 26 
   year-old Frank LaLoggia (<B><A HREF="lady_in_white_1988.htm">LADY IN WHITE</A></B> 
   - 1988), <B><A HREF="fear_no_evil_1980b.htm">FEAR NO EVIL</A></B> is 
   probably the most definitive case of style over substance. The 
   atmosphere is laid on thick and consists of wonderfully-used camera 
   tricks (the feeling of hopelessness between Andrew's mother and 
   father for Andrew's first 18 years of life could not have been done 
   better than the time-lapse photography mentioned earlier) and the use 
   of the entire widescreen image to convey alienation (used expertly in 
   a funeral scene) is fantastic. If I have a complaint, it's that the 
   screenplay (also by LaLoggia) is too derivative of other films, like 
   1976's <B><A HREF="carrie_1976.htm">CARRIE</A></B> (there's a shower 
   scene where the jocks pick on Andrew, only to have it bite the main 
   bully in the ass) and <B>THE OMEN</B> (the whole Anti-Christ angle), 
   which I am sure were on LaLoggia's mind when he was writing this as 
   they were both fairly fresh films at the time. The fantastic finale 
   (at the town's annual re-enactment of Christ's birth and death), 
   which is full of scenes of the dead rising from their graves mixed 
   with foggy neon lighting and laser effects (also fairly new at the 
   time) are what previous viewers remember most about this film as it 
   is fast-paced, bloody and comes out of nowhere. Mix in a soundtrack 
   with songs by The Ramones, Boomtown Rats, Sex Pistols, Patti Smith 
   and other punk bands and this was quite a treat for teens both in 
   sight and sound when it originally played in theaters in 1980, 
   especially after a joint or two (that's how I saw it). This 
   low-budget gem may seem a little creaky today, but it still holds up 
   as an atmospheric foray into the supernatural. I dare you not to 
   smile when Andrew's drunken father (Barry Cooper) yells in a bar, 
   &quot;My son's the Devil!&quot; over and over. It's also the only 
   horror film where you'll witness a death by dodgeball and see a man 
   grow breasts (and then kill himself!). There's also a surprising 
   amount of full frontal male nudity but very little female nudity as 
   the film has an underlying theme of homosexuality or, I should say, a 
   fear of homosexuality as the shower and breast-growing scenes so 
   beautifully display. Good stuff. <B><A HREF="fear_no_evil_1980d.htm">FEAR

   (2006) -</B> This is the film that was made during Season 3 of <B><A HREF="project_greenlight_season_3.htm">PROJECT
    GREENLIGHT</A></B> and, after watching all the hoops first-time 
   director John Gulager had to jump through to get this made, I'm glad 
   to report that it's probably the best horror film released in 2006. 
   After a humorous opening, which gives a brief bio and life expectancy 
   of each character, the film immediately kicks into gear. A barfull of <A HREF="feast_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/feast dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="231" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>lowlifes
    and losers must band together and fight four creatures which are 
   trying to get inside. The creatures, which have huge teeth and razor 
   sharp claws, are hungry for flesh and looking to get even with the 
   woman (Navi Rawat) who hit and killed one of them (possibly the 
   grandfather of the pack) when driving with her husband (who is the 
   first to get killed after bursting into the bar and announcing, 
   &quot;I'm the one who's gonna save your asses!&quot; and then 
   promptly gets decapitated). As the occupants bitch and moan and then 
   finally band together, the creatures pick them off one-by-one in 
   various gory ways (dismemberments, eye gougings, head squishings, 
   dissolving bodies by spitting a slimey green goo on them). That's 
   basically all there is to the plot and I know it sounds generic, but 
   Gulager's execution is anything but generic. The whole film has a 
   manic comic tone to it, like a Three Stooges short taken to the next 
   level. Clothes are ripped off, body appendages are accidentally blown 
   off and, just when you thought you've seen it all, the film reminds 
   you that you haven't. I loved the part where they introduce Kevin 
   Smith regular Jason Mewes (playing himself) only to immediately have 
   his face ripped-off by a baby creature and then get shotgunned in the 
   chest by the bartender (a welcome return to films by genre vet Clu 
   Gulager [<B><A HREF="return_of_the_living_dead_1986.htm">RETURN OF 
   THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> - 1985], the director's father). The whole 
   film is full of little surprises like that and the script (by Patrick 
   Melton and Marcus Dunstan) is full of choice one-liners sure to bring 
   a smile to your face. My favorite line comes when one of the men (who 
   was drenched in the creature's goo) asks one of the women how he 
   looks (he lost an eye and his face is dissolving). She takes one look 
   at him and throws up. He just looks at her and says, &quot;You 
   shoulda been a nurse&quot;. If there's one complaint I could lodge 
   against this film, it would be that some of the editing is way too 
   quick, making some of the action hard to distinguish. It was probably 
   done to cover-up some of the more low-budget aspects of the film. 
   But, that's just a minor quibble as <B><A HREF="feast_2006b.htm">FEAST</A></B> 
   is a bloody good show for fans of horror. I can't wait to see what 
   John Gulager does next without all the cameras and interference that 
   dogged him during the shooting of this one. It should be a doozy (It 
   turns his next assignments would be to direct two sequels to this 
   film: <B><A HREF="feast_2_sloppy_seconds_2008.htm">FEAST II: SLOPPY SECONDS</A></B> 
   [2008] and <B><A HREF="feast_3_the_happy_finish_2009.htm">FEAST III:

    3DD</A></B> [2012], which was supposed to go for a theatrical 
   release, but went the DTV route instead). Dimension Films gave this a 
   cursory one week theatrical release (using the R-rated cut) before 
   dumping it to DVD. With the right marketing campaign, Dimension could 
   have had a winner on their hands, but we know how fickle executive 
   producers Bob &amp; Harvey Weinstein are. Just be happy this film was 
   released and didn't end up sitting on a shelf for a couple of years

   and Andrea murder his new girlfriend, Paula (Carla Conti), in some

   plays along so she can find clues about her sister. What Hilda 
   doesn't know about Dr. Nescu is that he is a powerful mentalist (He 
   proves is powers to a doubting visiting Prince by making a male 
   lounge singer lose his voice while singing a song in a cocktail bar) 
   and Hilda falls under his black powers, falling madly in love with 
   him and revealing who she really is. Hilda is warned several times by 
   complete strangers to stay away from Dr. Nescu (one crazy lady even

   confusing finale finds Dr. Nescu trying to make Hilda his new Sheba, 
   but a jilted Andrea (don't ask, I know she's supposed to be a 
   lesbian) stabs Dr. Nescu in the back before he can finish the 
   ceremony. Or does he?&nbsp; This Spanish/Italian co-production, also 
   known as <B><A HREF="feast_for_the_devil_1971.htm">FEAST FOR THE DEVIL</A></B>,
    is a dreary, slow-moving horror thriller that contains horrible 
   pacing, god-awful dubbing (try watching the scene where Dr. Nescu 
   uses his mentalist powers on the male lounge singer and try not to 
   laugh) and a plot that makes very little sense, as well as stretching 
   credibility a little too far. Why on earth would Hilda fall in love 
   with the man who is quite possibly responsible for her sister's 
   disappearance and why the hell would her good friend Carlos (who also 
   harbors secret feelings for her) or Inspector Gonzales let her? This 
   film relies on too many convenient coincidences to advance the plot 
   (Dr. Nescu is a playboy, yet he has a severe hatred for his mother, 
   whom he use to watch whipping his father with a belt as a child. 
   Shouldn't he be a homosexual instead?). Director Jose Maria Elorrieta (<B><A HREF="curse_of_the_vampire_1972.htm">THE
    CURSE OF THE VAMPIRE</A></B> - 1972), using the pseudonym &quot;Joe 
   Lacy&quot;, offers very little for the viewer to enjoy, as there is 
   minimal blood, only a touch of nudity (both Nell and Gimpera do strut 
   around in bikinis on several occasions, though) and the script (by 
   Jose Luis Navarro, Marino Girolami and Miguel Madrid [as &quot;Micael 
   Skife&quot;]) that will have you scratching your head in complete 
   confusion and desperation, as you try to make sense of all the 
   characters' actions (Especially the ludicrous finale, where two 
   people commit suicide and Hilda suffers the same white-haired fate as 
   her sister, even though Dr. Nescu is dead. What the fuck?). File this 
   under &quot;What The Hell Were They Smoking When They Made This?&quot;
    This is nothing but plenty of camera zooms on Dr. Nescu's eyeballs 
   and garish early-70's fashions. I was hoping &quot;Tills Nescu&quot;

    BEST FRIEND IS A VAMPIRE</A></B> - 1988) seems to have forgotten 
   what makes a slasher film work: Lots of inventive bloody deaths. 
   After the initial car stabbing, it takes nearly 55 minutes for the 
   next murder to take place. The murders are always clouded in 
   darkness, so you never see the payoffs. I will give one concession to 
   the killer: When he stabs someone, it's usually multiple times, not 
   &quot;one stab and you're dead&quot;. For a slasher flick, <B><A HREF="final_exam_1981c.htm">FINAL
    EXAM</A></B> is way too tame. The acting, by a cast of unknowns, 
   isn't too bad, but the story just meanders along at a much too 
   leisurely pace, playing like a low-rent version of <B><A HREF="animal_house_1978.htm">ANIMAL
    HOUSE</A></B> (1978) until the final 30 minutes, when all the campus 
   fun stops and the killer dispatches everyone except Courtney who, in 
   the finale, stabs him about a dozen times (all of it placed 
   conveniently just off-screen). The killer's (played by Timothy L. 
   Raynor) motivation is never explained, so the killings really have no 
   meaning. While many real-life serial killers may kill for no reason, 
   it helps in low-budget horror films like this if we understand why 
   the killer is killing. There's also no nudity (although there's 
   plenty of sex talk amongst the cast) and very little foul language. 
   The reason for this is probably because director Jimmy Huston got his 
   start working for producer/star Earl Owensby (this movie was filmed 
   at his E.O. Motion Picture Studio in Shelby, North Carolina, but 
   otherwise Owensby had nothing to do with it), whose early films were 
   advertised as &quot;family friendly&quot;, a mindset that Huston 
   probably found hard to shake when he was writing the script for this. 
   Although the film is rated R, a couple of small edits amounting to 
   less than 5 seconds would put it in PG (not even PG-13) territory.

   be waiting to drive them home. When Eggar hears they are going to 
   Mill Creek, he becomes agitated and tells them the place is not safe 
   and he should drive them to another location. Eggar is treated like 
   an outcast by the rest of the crew because he acts strange (to put it 
   politely), so when Eggar starts driving them to their destination and 
   they pass a mental institution, Cerone (Adrian Zmed - TV's <B><A HREF="t_j_hooker_tv_series_1982-1986.htm">T.J.
    HOOKER</A></B> [1982 - 1986]) says, &quot;Hey Eggar, there's your 
   former home!&quot;, to which Eggar shoots him a dirty look. Once at 
   their first destination, Boone (Lewis Smith in his film debut; He 
   would next make <B><A HREF="southern_comfort_1981.htm">SOUTHERN COMFORT</A></B> 
   - 1981, which is similar in plot to this film) tells a horror story 
   around a campfire about a murderous lumberjack who gets a woman 
   pregnant. She has the baby boy and then goes crazy, being committed 
   to the very same mental institution that they passed. Years later, 
   the crazy woman's son comes for her and they escape from the mental 
   institution and she is hiding somewhere in the same part of the 
   forest they are in now (it ends with the typical second person 
   jumping out of the darkness to finish the practical joke and scaring 
   the crap out of everyone else). Eggar does not find the story funny 
   and leaves to drive the bus to the final destination. Speaking of 
   practical jokes, the gung-ho Zorich (John Friedrich, who gets top 
   billing) and Nathaniel (Ernest Harden Jr.) play a practical joke on 
   Cerone, where they agree to cut him in for one-third of a 
   non-existent marijuana crop, as long as he stays behind and howls 
   like a wolf (to keep away unwanted visitors) until they come back 
   with some weed . Cerone continues to howl like a wolf through the 
   night, while Zorich and Nathaniel return to the camp to get some 
   sleep. When Mike (Mark Metcalf; <B><A HREF="animal_house_1978.htm">ANIMAL
    HOUSE</A></B> - 1978), the leader of the group, discovers the 
   practical joke and Cerone is missing from his sleeping bag, he, 
   Zorich and Nathaniel go looking for him, only to discover Cerone's 
   bandanna wrapped around a bloody animal skin. Mike sends Zorich and 
   Nathaniel back to get Mike's girlfriend, Melanie (Cindy Harrell), who 
   also knows these woods well, to search for Cerone. Mike and Melanie 
   decide to stop their search long enough for a little lovemaking in a 
   stream, but Mike is brutally murdered by someone wearing animal skins 
   and a homemade blade that is attached to the wrist (Melanie's fate is 
   at-yet unknown). Zorich and Nathaniel find a dilapidated shack in the 
   middle of nowhere, that is full of dead animal parts and evidence 
   that the shack belongs to Eggar. The rest of the group, which 
   consists of the whiny Margaret (Rachel Ward; <B><A HREF="night_school_1981.htm">NIGHT
    SCHOOL</A></B> - 1981), Windy (Daryl Hannah; <B><A HREF="hide_and_seek_2000.htm">HIDE

    BLOW</A></B> - 1986), are worried when Mike and Melanie don't return 
   (Cerone is fine and was playing a practical joke of his own on Zorich 
   and Nathaniel, but the killer makes a visit to their camp to run it's 
   dirt-encrusted hands through Margaret's hair and then disappear) and, 
   that night, Vanessa discovers Mike's severed head in the outhouse and 
   they all believe that Eggar is to blame. All of them head to the 
   shack, where they discover Mike's severed hand in a jar (the killer 
   is still holding a still-alive Melanie in a hidden room beneath the 
   floor), so they decide to hop in the raft and head down river and 
   pray the bus is there waiting for them. After Margaret warns everyone 
   that she cannot swim (Why the hell is she even doing on this 
   outing?), they jump in the raft and head down river, where at one 
   point where the river is small, the killer dumps Melanie's now-dead 
   body into their raft (her throat has been cut from ear-to-ear). Still 
   thinking that Eggar is the killer, they are happy to find the bus is 
   at the final destination, but the engine has been destroyed and it is 
   going nowhere. The group (after burying Melanie's body) decide to 
   spend the night in the bus and hike to civilization the next morning, 
   but the killer attacks the bus at night with an ax, a spear and the 
   wrist blade, but everyone escapes through the emergency exit window 
   in the back of the bus. Windy manages to get separated from the rest 
   of the group and the killer slices her neck, but the group manage to 
   make it to her before she can be murdered. Cerone and Zorich go back 
   to the bus to get the first aid kit <A HREF="final_terror_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/final terror vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="267" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>to
    patch her up and after she is treated, the group devises a plan to 
   trap and capture Eggar. They find the perfect place for an ambush, 
   but Zorich begins to act strange because he has eaten some &quot;magic
    mushrooms&quot; he found in the shack (this actually turns out to be 
   in the group's favor, as Zorich sets up the best booby trap because 
   he is so high, the danger of setting it up doesn't affect him). Once 
   they are ready, Cerone starts yelling out, &quot;We're going to get 
   you Eggar!&quot;, and Eggar takes the bait, wrapping a piece of rope 
   around Cerone's neck, but everyone else except for Zorich is 
   camouflaged and attack and beat Eggar to within an inch of his life. 
   It is now discovered that the killer is actually Eggar's mother 
   (played by male Tony Maccario, who was also in charge of Props), who 
   kills Zorich and then sets off the booby trap: a log with sharpened 
   wooden spikes sticking out of it that swings on a rope and impales 
   Eggar's mother, killing her.&nbsp; Although the film carries a 1983 
   copyright date, it was actually made in 1981 and took two years to 
   find a distributor (Samuel Z. Arkoff was Executive Producer), thanks

   [1979] fame was one of the screenwriters], but because the body count 
   was so low, the opening scene with the biker couple was shot after 
   principal photography was completed to increase the amount of deaths 
   (it is still a small body count considering the size of the group) 
   and the short running time. Rachel Ward is extremely bad in this 
   because she screams out every one of her lines and generally acts 
   like a bitch. It would have been great if she were the first victim 
   because the film would have been so much better for it. As it stands, 
   the film is at least bearable and not a total loss (some of the 
   effects are rather bloody), but there are much better &quot;terror in

   It's always a good idea when you're making a horror film to have at 
   least one character you can sympathize with or at least root for. 
   This ultra low-budget 16mm epic has none. After a lengthy set-up

   doctors and high school<A HREF="flesh_eating_mothers_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/flesh eating mothers dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="133" HEIGHT="193" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   hooligans, the film kicks in gear when an unknown virus (passed by a 
   cheating husband to a bunch of his married conquests) infects the 
   women, causing them to become hungry for the taste of human flesh. 
   When divorced cop Clyde McCormick (Mickey Ross) goes to his ex-wife's 
   home and finds her chowing-down on their son, he shoots her in the 
   head, since that seems to be the only place on her body that a bullet 
   works (fuckin' George Romero and his mythology!). He's arrested for 
   her murder when no one believes his story, although the one-armed 
   Police Commissioner (Ken Eaton) should since he lost his arm years 
   earlier due to a similar incident. Clyde escapes custody determined 
   to find out what the hell is going on and why the commissioner is 
   covering it up. It's not long before every mother and wife begins 
   eating members of their families in very graphic ways. Clyde works 
   with the vertically-challenged medical examiner, Dr. Grouly (Michael 
   Feuer, one of the worst actors I have ever seen), while the surviving 
   kids band together trying to find a way to stop their flesh eating 
   mothers. Armed with a new vaccine (which turns out to be penicillin!) 
   which will reverse the virus, the kids try to &quot;stick it to&quot; 
   their mothers before the police kill them all.&nbsp; I guess the best 
   word to describe this film is amateurish. It's apparent when watching 
   the film that no one in it has any acting experience as there's not a 
   decent performance in the bunch. Director James Aviles Martin (who 
   has since gone on to make documentaries) tries to make this a gore 
   comedy, but fails miserably on both counts, as the gore, while 
   extremely bloody, is not very convincing and the comedy consists of 
   people saying lines like, &quot;What's eating you?&quot; and 
   &quot;Fuck you, you fucking cannibal!&quot; The Elite Entertainment 
   DVD offers the full unrated cut (<A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Academy Ent.">Academy
    Entertainment</A> offered both an R-rated edit as well as the 
   Unrated cut on VHS), but the widescreen transfer is very grainy at 
   times, thanks to it's 16mm origin. Like I said in the beginning, the 
   total lack of sympathetic (nevermind believable) characters sink this 
   film and the bad acting and chintzy make-up effects don't help 
   either. My advice is to avoid this one unless you like sitting 
   through 89 minutes of tedium. Also starring Robert Lee Oliver,

   Frederick, who has perfected a rejuvenation procedure that involves

   applied to live people, give that person new youth and vigor. When 
   some shady South American dudes in dark suits and black sunglasses

   Jose (Bill Rogers), one of the South Americans who have taken over 
   Frederick's house. When Dr. Frederick performs a practice experiment 
   on Max Bauer (Martell), an old man with a scarred face (to satisfy

   Adolph Hitler (!) and Dr. Frederick has revenge on her mind, since 
   her mother died in one of Hitler's concentration camps. The film ends 
   abruptly with Dr. Frederick using her maggots on Hitler in a whole 
   new way, while she cackles &quot;Heil Hitler!&quot; in front of a 
   portrait of her dead mother.&nbsp; Even at 72 minutes, the film seems 
   hopelessly padded as the Jose subplot and another involving a 
   newspaper reporter/C.I.A. agent Dan Carter (Kerwin) go nowhere and 
   neither one is resolved. The entire film looks to have been shot 
   silent and the post-synch dubbing, though done by the actors, barely 
   match the lip movements. The film is also hopelessly dated, as every 
   male character wears a dark suit with a skinny tie and most of the 
   women sport beehive hairdos, except for Lake, who still wears her 
   hair as she did when she was a femme fatale in films such as <B><A HREF="this_gun_for_hire_1942.htm">THIS

   (2006) -</B> Here's a question I have for all the big movie

   version of <B><A HREF="snakes_on_a_plane_2006.htm">SNAKES ON A PLANE</A></B> 
   (2006), this film is a hoot and a half to watch. After being 
   introduced to all the major characters on Flight 239 heading to 
   Paris, including a cop named Truman (David Chisum); his prisoner 
   Frank (the wonderful Kevin J. O'Connor), who profoundly professes his 
   innocence; pro golfer Long Shot (Derek Webster); his alcoholic wife 
   and several dozen other passengers, we learn that the evil Dr. Leo 
   Bennett (Erick Avari), who is also on the plane, has brought a new 
   virus on-board that can bring the dead back to life. When bad 
   turbulence causes the cargo to shift, the virus is set loose when the 
   cryogenically frozen body of Dr. Kelly (Laura Cayouette) is released 
   and she begins biting and infecting passengers. As more people begin 
   getting exposed (and turning into decaying zombies), the unafflicted 
   passengers band together and try to figure out how to stop the 
   infection from spreading. Dr. Bennett tries to cover-up the truth 
   (even resorting to <A HREF="flight_of_the_living_dead_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/flight of the living dead dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>murder),
    so Truman, Long Shot, flight attendant Megan (Kristen Kerr), TSA 
   agent Paul Rudd (Richard Tyson) and even Frank (who has escaped 
   Truman's custody during the turbulence) pitch in and fight the zombie 
   onslaught. With the plane's radio out of order and the government now 
   well-aware what is loose on-board, the motley group must find a way 
   to defeat the virus and stop the government from vaporizing the plane 
   before it flies over a populated area. Things take a turn for the 
   worse when both the pilot and co-pilot are infected and the plane 
   goes on auto pilot. It will take some quick thinking and 
   self-sacrifice to rid the plane of the zombies, stop the fighter jet 
   from firing it's rockets and, finally, crash-landing the plane so the 
   four survivors can walk away.&nbsp; While this film is nothing more 
   than your basic &quot;zombies-on-the-loose where no one can 
   escape&quot; scenario that we have seen dozens of times before, this 
   film has plenty of attitude (and altitude) to spare and generates a 
   good share of scares and tension. It's also got a wicked sense of 
   black humor. Also unusual for a film of this&nbsp; type are the 
   calibre of actors involved, some in nothing but bit parts. Besides 
   the ones already mentioned, there's Brian Thompson (as the soldier 
   who guards the virus on the plane and becomes it's first victim), 
   Raymond Barry (as the pilot), Dale Midkiff (as Dr. Lucas, one of the 
   early victims), Tucker Smallwood (as Colonel Wolff) and David 
   Spielberg (as Dr. Conroy). The film also has some very well-done 
   action and horror set-pieces, such as when Paul accidentally fires 
   his weapon in the cargo hold and the bullet ends up killing a flight 
   attendant above or the scene in the plane's bathroom, where we are 
   led to believe a zombie is going to pop out of the toilet, only to 
   have it suddenly appear somewhere else. There's even a scene of 
   zombies rising up out of the ground, only in this case they are 
   tearing their way from the plane's floors rather than from graves. 
   The film is very bloody and goes way past an R-rating, as people are 
   graphically eaten, shot (Paul says, &quot;Two in the chest, one in 
   the balls!&quot; as he and Truman use the zombies for target 
   practice) and dismembered. One scene shows a nun (There's one on 
   every plane, isn't there?) having her legs chewed off as she crawls 
   away, minus any lower limbs. So much for divine intervention! The 
   visual humor is in some of the zombie attacks and aftermath and most 
   of the verbal humor is supplied by Kevin J. O'Connor (<B><A HREF="deep_rising_1998.htm">DEEP

   and Long Shot using his golf clubs to decapitate a zombie) speak for

   &quot;terror in the woods&quot; horror film is from a director I 
   respect (but more on him later), so I guess I was expecting more than 
   I got. It begins with a married couple hiking in the woods, the wife 
   fearing that someone is following them. She takes the lead and then 
   the husband starts to feel the very same way. They forge ahead, but 
   the husband loses sight of his wife&nbsp; and someone stabs him in 
   the stomach (one of the film's few examples of quick gore) with a 
   shiny hunting knife (When the wife hears her husband's death throes,

   sees her husband's bloody corpse, but she then becomes the prey and 
   eventually ends up with her throat cut with the very same knife. We

   sweltering heat and traffic jams<A HREF="forest_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/forest vhs front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="169" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   (&quot;It took us two hours to go four miles!&quot;). Steve tries to 
   calm him down, telling Charlie that he needs a vacation and he knows 
   the exact place: a secret camping site that no one knows about (<B>Charlie:</B> 
   &quot;Why?&quot;&nbsp; <B>Steve:</B> &quot;Because they don't know 
   about it!&quot;) and talks Charlie into joining him there. It doesn't 
   take the sharpest tool in the shed to realize where they are heading, 
   which only means more trouble and death. Steve says he and his 
   &quot;jailer&quot; (i.e. wife) are not getting along and are thinking 
   about divorce. The two couples have dinner that night, where Charlie 
   mentions to his wife Teddi (Ann Wilkinson) that he and Steve are 
   going camping next weekend, so Teddi and Steve's wife Sharon (actress 
   Tomi Barrett, who uses the name &quot;Elaine Warner&quot; here) tell 
   their husbands they are going camping...tomorrow...alone. Charlie and 
   Steve come up with the idea to follow them there (Sharon knows the 
   secret camping place because she and Steve have been there before) 
   but, as they begin to the next day, the radiator on Charlie's Mazda 
   truck springs a leak and they are delayed by four hours while a 
   garage mechanic fixes it. The wives know that their husbands are 
   following them and Sharon becomes concerned when Steve doesn't show 
   up, but the women start hiking by themselves and eventually make it 
   to the secret camping spot. They notice that a thunderstorm will hit 
   in a few hours and try to pitch a tent, but neither one of them knows 
   how to do it. By the time Charlie and Steve make it to Steve's wife's 
   parked car, it is rapidly approaching sundown and a Forest Ranger 
   (played by the director) shows up and warns the two that it is 
   dangerous to travel in this part of the forest at night because 
   people have entered and never been seen again. Charlie and Steve 
   ignore his advice and begin their hike and, as night falls, Charlie 
   depends on Steve to find his way to the secret camping site. Teddi 
   and Sharon are sitting around a campfire wondering where their 
   husbands are and getting scared by the sounds of the forest (we hear 
   a panther roar, but there are no panthers in the forest!), not 
   knowing that two ghost children, John Jr. (Corky Pigeon) and Jennifer 
   (Becki Burke) are talking nearby (we know they are ghosts because, 
   when they talk, their words echo and reverb). Suddenly, the ghostly 
   apparition of the children's mother (Jeanette Kelly) appears before 
   the two frightened women and she asks, &quot;Have you seen my 
   children? If you do, send them home. They must be punished!&quot; 
   (The mother has blood dripping down her forehead). The two women are 
   now scared witless and Sharon starts brandishing a knife, while Steve 
   and Charlie get lost. The two ghost children go to their house in a 
   cave, where their father, John (Genre vet Gary Kent, here using the 
   name &quot;Michael Brody&quot;. You really need to read his 
   autobiography, <B>&quot;Shadows &amp; Light: Journeys With Outlaws in 
   Revolutionary Hollywood&quot;</B> from Dalton Publishing. It one of 
   the best books about doing nearly everything in low-budget 
   filmmaking, laced with personal stories that will make you laugh and 
   surprise you.), tells his kids that their mother was looking for 
   them. John is an odd duck to say the least, sitting in a wicker chair 
   wearing ripped jeans and a t-shirt and sporting a trucker's cap. When 
   his children tell him that two women are camped out by the river, he 
   jumps up and goes to get them, but the two ghost children show up 
   first, John Jr. holding a bloody knife in his hand, the blood 
   dripping on Teddi's forehead, as the children say, &quot;You must 
   run. Daddy's coming.&quot; Turns out Daddy is a cannibal and hasn't 
   eaten for days, so he gets his hands on Teddi, stabs her repeatedly 
   with his knife as she tries to crawl away and finishes her off by 
   slitting her throat. Sharon runs away and jumps off a cliff into the 
   river below to escape John, as John returns to collect Teddi's body 
   and carries her corpse back to his cave as it begins to rain. The 
   pouring rain just delays Steve and Charlie more, as they are forced 
   to go into a cave to stay dry, but of all the caves to pick, they 
   pick the one John resides in. Charlie sees a huge chunk of meat 
   cooking over a fire pit, not knowing that it is actually a chunk of 
   flesh taken from his wife's dead body. The two ghost children tell 
   them that their father will not be too pleased that they are there, 
   but John suddenly appears and offers to share his meal with them. 
   Steve says he is not hungry, but Charlie says he will try a piece and 
   ends up eating a piece of Teddi. Charlie tells John that it is tasty, 
   but then he gets a sudden chill and doesn't want to eat any more. 
   When Charlie asks John why he lives in a cave, John actually is 
   relieved to tell his story to someone for the very first time (cue 
   the flashback!). John tells a long story about how his wife was 
   always calling repairmen to fix some piece of kitchen appliance that 
   has broken down. He really thinks nothing about it until one day when 
   he comes home early from the butcher shop he works at, sick as a dog. 
   He catches his wife in bed with the refrigerator repairman and she 
   flaunts it in John's face, laughing at him. When John asks where 
   their two children are, he finds his wife has locked them in the 
   bedroom closet, so he frees them and tells them to go play outside. 
   The repairman leaves the bedroom to repair the refrigerator, as 
   John's wife calls him &quot;impotent&quot; and tells him she 
   regularly breaks appliances so she can sleep with the repairmen that 
   arrive. John begins to strangle her and then bashes her head against 
   the edge of the night table, killing her (hence the blood in her 
   forehead when she is a ghost). John then grabs a butcher knife and 
   goes outside, tries to kill the repairman and, after a short scuffle, 
   finally kills him on the large round blade of a huge circular saw (we 
   really don't see any blood). He brings his children to the forest to 
   hide, but when the children kill themselves because they are not 
   &quot;happy&quot; (He doesn't tell Charlie or Steve that part of the 
   story), John is regularly paid visits by their ghosts as well as his 
   wife's, who still wants to hurt the children (Can one ghost actually 
   hurt another? I guess that's a discussion for another time.) The 
   children don't like their Daddy's killing habits, so they always give 
   his victims a warning before he attacks, but they still love him 
   nonetheless. Charlie and Steve leave the camp the following morning 
   and discover that their wives' campsite is empty. They split up to go 
   look for them, but have no luck, so they meet back at the campsite, 
   where Steve finds a trail of blood. Meanwhile, Sharon runs into the 
   children, who warn her to hide because &quot;Daddy is hunting.&quot; 
   (She finds a great hiding place in a crevass in a boulder). Steve 
   knows something is wrong and wants to make the six hour hike back to 
   alert the authorities. After one more quick search, Steve heads back 
   to civilization, while Charlie remains behind at the campsite in case 
   the women return. Steve takes a tumble down the rocks and breaks his 
   leg (there's a quick shot of a leg bone sticking out of his skin), 
   while the children tell Sharon that one of the men is hurt and the 
   other one is back at the campsite. Charlie has a scary encounter with 
   the ghost mother just before being attacked by John (<B>Charlie:</B> 
   &quot;What are you, crazy?&quot;&nbsp; <B>John:</B> &quot;Crazy? We 
   all are! I need some food because Winter's coming!&quot;). Charlie 
   beats up John and runs away, <A HREF="forest_1981_dvd2.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/forest dvd6 front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="306" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>with
    John close behind. They get into a fight in a river, where John 
   drowns Charlie, strings him upside-down from a tree and starts 
   skinning him for meat (like a hunter does with a deer, but we really 
   don't see anything). Sharon sees it all and when John is about to 
   kill her, the children threaten to disappear and never see him again 
   (which will leave him alone with his bitch wife's ghost), so he lets 
   Sharon go. John goes and finds Steve and just as he is about to kill 
   him, Sharon appears and stabs John to death with his own knife. I 
   guess Steve and Sharon have reconciled and divorce is off the table, 
   but John's wife watches as John and the children disappear forever, 
   leaving her to roam the forest alone for all eternity. The only one 
   that will be &quot;punished&quot; is her.&nbsp; Since this film was 
   directed and written by Don Jones, who was responsible for some good 
   horror films and thrillers (<B><A HREF="who_did_cock_robin_1970.htm">WHO

    AND THE GHOST</A></B> - 1991), I was expecting a little more than I 
   got in this film. The bloodletting is kept to a minimum, which is 
   weird because of the cannibalism angle. I guess Jones was just doing 
   this film for the hell of it, as he offers none of his usual tension 
   or black humor like in most if his other films and is very light on 
   the gore that people would expect in horror films from the 
   early-80's. Besides being a director and screenwriter, Jones was a 
   cinematographer and director of photography (he shot this film using 
   the name &quot;Nod Senoj&quot;, which will have cryptographers 
   working overtime...not!), shooting such films as <B><A HREF="house_of_seven_corpses_1973.htm">HOUSE

   Gary Kent, who worked on a lot more worse films with Al Adamson (<B><A HREF="dracula_vs_frankenstein_1971.htm">DRACULA

   Although this film runs a tad too long at 115 minutes, at least the 
   title delivers on its promise. This is not your 30's &amp; 40's

   him with fresh corpses for his experiments. Victor is a teacher at 
   the same university and this week's subject is &quot;The Philosophy 
   of Medicine&quot;, where he asks his students what it means to 
   &quot;exist&quot;. One student replies so we try to be immortal like 
   God and Victor agrees, telling all of them that they have a piece of 
   God in them; they just have to find it and use it to their full 
   potential (Victor is most probably an Atheist and the word 
   &quot;God&quot; basically means to him the &quot;creation&quot; of 
   life.). Another teacher at the university, Naihla Khalil (Ashton 
   Leigh; <B><A HREF="american_horror_house_2012.htm">AMERICAN HORROR HOUSE</A></B> 
   - 2012), who is Victor's girlfriend, has just returned from an 
   expedition to Egypt to study pyramids and has come back with a 6th 
   Dynasty, 3,000 year-old mummy named Userkara and has brought him to a 
   lab in the university (&quot;Artistic License #1&quot;: No country, 
   especially Egypt, would let an artifact like that ever leave their 
   country). This is one of the oldest mummies ever found in the world 
   and Victor notices that his ears are missing, where research 
   scientist Isaac (Robert MacNaughton; the oldest brother of Henry 
   Thomas in <B><A HREF="et_the_extra_terrestrial_1982.htm">E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL</A></B> 
   [1982], in one of his very few films as an adult) tells Victor that 
   his ears were cut off while he was still alive (Victor says, &quot;He 
   must have really pissed someone off!&quot;, to which Naihla replies, 
   &quot;You don't know the half of it.&quot; I wonder what she meant by 
   that?). Isaac also says that an ancient scroll was found next to the 
   mummy, written in a language not seen before (apparently, he was an 
   evil pharaoh not written about in any texts or ancient books) and 
   when Naihla translated the scroll, it says in effect that Userkara's 
   soul is trapped within his mummified body for eternity and anyone who 
   dares to desecrate the body are doomed to an agonizing death 
   (&quot;Artistic License #2&quot;: If the scroll was written in an 
   ancient language no one has ever seen before, how did Naihla 
   translate it?). The piece of scroll describing how to release 
   Userkara's soul is missing, but &quot;greater-than-thou&quot; 
   scientist Professor Walton (T. Boomer Tibbs; <B><A HREF="paranormal_asylum_2013.htm">PARANORMAL
    ASYLUM</A></B> - 2013) thinks the scroll is nothing but a scare 
   tactic put next to the body to deter tomb raiders from stealing 
   artifacts from Userkara's crypt. He couldn't be more wrong. It seems 
   Carter doesn't acquire corpses for Victor, he creates them, as we 
   seem him viciously stab a homeless man (Martin Pfeffercom) in the 
   stomach with a long knife and then cut the top of the bum's head off 
   with a hacksaw, removing his brain. Cut to Victor and Naihla having a 
   romantic dinner, where she jokingly accuses Victor of being an 
   Atheist (which I believe he is) or a Satanist (which I firmly believe 
   he isn't), for having different views than her on life and the 
   afterlife (She says that old standby: &quot;There are powers on Earth 
   greater than anyone can imagine.&quot;). Professor Walton, not 
   heeding the scroll's warning, cuts open the mummy's chest when no one 
   is around and a gas is released from the incision, knocking the 
   Professor out. When he comes to, he now has some type of psychic 
   connection to Userkara and Isaac returns from his dinner break to 
   discover that the Professor has removed the oldest known stone 
   carving of the Eye Of Horus (an ancient Egyptian symbol of 
   protection) from the mummy's chest. The Professor then proceeds to 
   slit Isaac's throat with a scalpel, making sure that the blood 
   flowing out of the gaping wound covers Userkara's face. The mummy 
   absorbs all the blood like it was never there and then we hear the 
   sound of a beating heart. Victor tells Naihla that he got into 
   medicine for a reason: His mother committed suicide (she slit her 
   wrists in a bathtub) when he was a very young boy and, since then, he 
   wants to know if death is permanent or if it can be reversed, 
   something he has never told anyone before (then we have the 
   prerequisite nude lovemaking scene). The next morning, Naihla goes 
   down to her lab (Victor has left earlier without saying goodbye, 
   which pisses her off) and discovers that something was removed from 
   Userkara's chest. She also notices that Professor Walton is acting 
   very strangely (he tells her he has been suffering from headaches) 
   and he also acts very strange when he is teaching his students about 
   Horus (the ancient Egyptians' national patron god who was usually 
   depicted as a falcon-headed man wearing the pschent, or a red and 
   white crown) and cuts the class short. Female student Lenora 
   (Stefanie Merola) agrees to meet the Professor later that night at 
   the lab to talk about an internship. We finally see Victor working in 
   his laboratory, when Carter enters and demands $30,000 for the bum's 
   brain. If Victor doesn't pay him the money, he will implicate him in 
   the murder of a homeless man. When Carter notices a dismembered human 
   hand moving by itself, Victor has no choice but to throw acid into 
   Carter's face and then stab him to death (In Victor's defense, he was 
   lying down on his back holding the knife when Carter tripped and fell 
   on it so, technically, Victor is not a murderer). With the bum's 
   brain in pieces on the floor, Victor has no option but to use 
   Carter's brain (that would not be my first choice), so he grabs a 
   hacksaw, cuts off the top of Carter's head and removes his brain, 
   then stitching his piecemeal body together and shooting it full of so 
   much electricity, the body begins to smoke. He is heartbroken because 
   he thinks his experiment was a failure and he totally misses a date 
   he set up with Naihla that night, which even pisses her off more. But 
   was Victor's experiment actually a failure? Lenora shows up at the 
   lab to talk to the Professor about the internship, but Userkara 
   (Brandon deSpain; who also played the mummy in the Danny Glover DTV 
   disaster <B><A HREF="day_of_the_mummy_2014.htm">DAY OF THE MUMMY</A></B> 
   [2014]) rises from his table for the first time, rips out her heart 
   with his bare hands and eats it (he even makes the Professor eat a 
   piece!). Userkara orders the Professor to bring Naihla to him, while 
   Victor chops-up Carter's body, stuffs the pieces in plastic bags and 
   hides them under a grate in his floor. He also notices that his naked 
   creature is missing from the gurney and, when he turns around, the 
   creature (Constantin Tripes) bites Victor's hand, but Victor is able 
   to knock out the creature with some chloroform and chain him to a 
   wall (in a tribute to the original Boris Karloff <B><A HREF="frankenstein_1932.htm">FRANKENSTEIN</A></B> 
   [1932], Victor yells out, &quot;It's alive!&quot;). The creature, who 
   has the ability to speak and read, is still as ugly as my Aunt Martha 
   without her makeup. Detective Brynner (Rahul Rai) is brought in to 
   investigate the disappearances of Lenora and Isaac and Naihla thinks 
   that the Professor is responsible, but she has no proof. The 
   Professor tries to get Naihla to get close to the mummy, but she 
   doesn't trust him and leaves the lab. Victor tries to apologize to 
   Naihla for the missed date and leaving her bedroom early without 
   saying goodbye, but she sees the bite on Victor's hand and follows 
   him back to the lab. She watches Victor talking to the creature, when 
   Victor notices her spying on him and catches her as she tries to run 
   away. He tries to explain to her what he is doing. but all she can 
   say to him is, &quot;You're insane!&quot;. The creatures breaks free 
   of his shackles on the wall and plots revenge against Victor 
   (remember, this is Carter's brain in the creature). A nosy security 
   guard enters Victor's lab and the creature rips his innards out, 
   followed by removing his lower jaw with his bare hands. When Victor 
   returns alone to his lab, he discovers the creature is now dressed in 
   Carter's clothes and knocks Victor out. When he wakes up, Victor is 
   chained to a pipe and the creature tells him that if he doesn't 
   transplant his brain into a better-looking body, he will kill Naihla 
   (a few moments before, he sees his monster face in a mirror and 
   breaks it, not worrying about a seven year curse). Userkara then 
   kills student William (Daniel Rodas) next, pulling out a piece of his 
   brain through his nose using a thin metal instrument with a hook on 
   the end (the way Egyptians prepared their mummies in ancient times). 
   Both Frankenstein's Monster and Userkara are interested in Naihla, so 
   I think we can all see what is coming: a monster brawl. Poor Naihla 
   can't catch a break no matter where she runs, so she grabs a gun on 
   the lab's floor, pumps a few shots into Userkara's body (with no 
   effect) and then heads to Victor's lab, where she frees him with a 
   well-placed shot to the chain. Naihla is one smart cookie, though, as 
   she convinces Userkara that she is his superior by talking in his 
   ancient language (&quot;Artistic License #3&quot;: How did Naihla 
   learn to speak a heretofore unknown language in such a short time?) 
   and tells him to kill the Professor. Userkara stabs Professor Walton 
   and then cuts off his tongue, nose, ears and eyes (he squishes the 
   eyes in his hands) then kills Victor and impales Naihla on the leg 
   with an ancient spear, but the final 15 minutes are pure monster 
   destruction. Frankenstein's <A HREF="frankenstein_vs_the_mummy_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/frankenstein vs. the mummy poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="213" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Monster
    and Userkara get into a royal rumble, where they fly through walls 
   and use anything they can find as weapons. Frankenstein's Monster 
   finally wins, cutting off one of Userkara arms, ripping out his heart 
   and pulverizes his head by using his fists like a vise. Seeing that 
   Victor is dead, the Monster tries to kill Naihla, but Victor isn't 
   quite dead yet, as he plant's a cleaver into his creation's cranium, 
   killing him. Victor then actually dies, but not before telling Naihla 
   that he loves her and telling her to burn his journal so no one can 
   replicate his experiment. She takes a can full of gas, douses 
   everything with it and sets it on fire, watching her love, what 
   remains of the two creatures and Victor's journal burn to a crisp. 
   Now taped off as a crime scene, one of Victor's students, Trevor 
   (Sean Rogers), tears down the tape and finds Victor's microcassette 
   recorder beneath the burned journal (&quot;Artistic License #4&quot;: 
   Wouldn't the Crime Scene Unit have found that recorder as evidence?). 
   The recorder still works, as Trevor listens to Victor describe his 
   experiment from beginning to end. A new Victor Frankenstein is 
   born.&nbsp; Like I said earlier, the film is overlong, has some major 
   plot holes and could use some judicious trimming, but

    NIGHT</A></B> - 2013) makes a pretty good monster film, complete 
   with some excellent makeup and gore effects (both Frankenstein's 
   Monster and Userkara look terrific and the gore scenes go far enough 
   for this film to be released without a rating and they are expertly 
   done). My only real problem with this film is that Max Rhyser as Dr. 
   Victor Frankenstein is a little too genteel to be taken seriously as 
   a person who would defy the law to get what he needs. He comes off 
   like some stable person who wouldn't hurt a soul (and would attend 
   peace rallies), even though his experiments scream otherwise (Let's 
   not get into a discussion on whether desecrating a corpse is nothing 
   but a misdemeanor. It does affect the victims' family, whether they 
   know about it or not.). He just isn't menacing enough. He's like the <B><A HREF="twilight_2008.htm">TWILIGHT</A></B> 
   (2008) version of Dr. Frankenstein. It seems like his experiments are 
   merely a sideline, as it takes more that half the film to actually 
   see him in his lab. The scene where Carter is talking to the homeless 
   guy before he kills him is one of the film's most effective scenes. 
   Carter asks the guy all types of questions, like why he doesn't stay 
   at a shelter (&quot;I'd rather be in prison instead!&quot;), if he 
   has any friends, his daughter (the bum has a blanket his daughter 
   made him and he tells Carter as long as he has this blanket, it 
   doesn't matter where he sleeps) and other personal questions, leading 
   up to the homeless guy getting stabbed in the gut, with Carter's 
   other hand over the bum's mouth telling him, &quot;Your daughter will 
   never have to worry about you again.&quot; It's a telling scene about 
   how Carter picks out his victims because, even though he's a 
   psychopath at heart, he still wants to make sure that his victims' 
   deaths affect as few people as possible. Even though the film sports 
   a 2015 copyright, I had the feeling that this film was made earlier, 
   because the last description of Victor's experiments that he left on 
   his microcassette recorder was dated 2013. Besides the film's length 
   and some very apparent plot holes, this is a pretty decent monster 
   film that delivers on its promise and tosses in plenty of bloody 
   gore. Also featuring Malika Franklin, Nicholas Deluca, Alexis Lear, 
   Nick Siano, Bryan Payor, Tien Law and Christine Simon. An <A HREF="http://www.us.rljentertainment.com">RLJ

   (1997) -</B> Nine years ago, in Vahalla Mills, Ohio, a fat, 
   disgusting (and pregnant) abusive mother keeps her facially deformed 
   son locked in the attic, slapping him around and chaining him up like 
   a dog. Mom unlocks the chains so he can eat and then goes into labor, 
   running downstairs to deliver her baby girl, which she then throws 
   into a burning barrel outside. The son sees her throw the baby into 
   the fire and rescues it, then going to his mother (who is 
   recuperating in bed) and caving her head in with a rock. A few days 
   later, the police arrive and, since they can't find the mother, the 
   baby girl is sent to Child Services and the deformed boy is sent to 
   an institution. <A HREF="freak_1997.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/freak dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="122" HEIGHT="174" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>In
    the present day, Stacy (Amy Paliginoff) and her nine year-old 
   adoptive sister Jodi (Andrea Johnson) are moving from Indianapolis to 
   Virginia Beach after the sudden death of Stacy's parents. At the same 
   time, the malformed boy, now an adult called Keller, is being moved 
   to a different institution, when he escapes. As Stacy and Jodi enter 
   Ohio on their way to Virginia Beach, they will cross paths with 
   Keller and neither Stacy or Jodi will come out unaffected. I submit 
   that you should look at Jodi's age and the fact that she's adopted to 
   connect the dots. Keller kidnaps Jodi and heads to his mother's 
   house. Stacy joins forces with Jason (Travis Patton), the security 
   guard that let Keller escape, to find Jodi and stop Keller's killing 
   spree.&nbsp; This ultra-low-budget film by first time 
   director/producer/writer Tyler Tharpe takes a while to get moving, 
   but once it does it's pretty entertaining. It's not hard to spot the 
   telegraphed connection between Keller and Jodi and Tharpe reveals it 
   at the halfway mark. Although the premise for Keller's escape is kind 
   of weak (Jason is on probation, so he doesn't report the escape 
   because he doesn't want to lose his job!), the film does build a fair 
   amount of suspense without being overly bloody. There's a surprising 
   reveal about Keller's condition near the end of the film (he lost one 
   of his senses, which explains his behavior all his life). The 
   showdown between Stacy and Keller is much too quick and is somewhat 
   disappointing. The film suffers from a grainy transfer and the 
   non-acting talents of little Andrea Johnson, who looks and acts like 
   she would rather be any place but here. The ending is also a letdown 
   as it seems Keller is way too easy to kill. Still, for a debut film, 
   it's none too bad and is worth at least one look. Also on the DVD is 
   a short black &amp; white film called <B>HEADCHEESE</B> (2001), a 
   pretentious <B><A HREF="texas_chainsaw_massacre_1974.htm">TEXAS

   quick-cutting and weird visuals, this insipid film induced headaches

    trying to do is fuse humans with the mutant carnivorous plants he 
   has created, the result being a human/plant hybrid that will survive 
   our uncertain future. The Professor has the horribly ugly Mr. Lynch 
   (Tom Baker) snatch students from the university for use in his 
   illicit experiments in exchange for the Professor reversing the 
   effects of Mr. Lynch's deformed face (a task you know immediately 
   that Nolter will never honor). The mistakes of Nolter's experiments 
   are sent to Mr. Lynch's freak show, where paying customers scream and 
   faint at the sight of them after paying an extra charge for the 
   privilege. During the middle part of the film we are shown an actual 
   freak show, where the diminutive co-owner and ringmaster Burns 
   (Michael Dunn, who died shortly after making this film) introduces us 
   to the Monkey Woman (Madge Garnett), the Human Pincushion (O.T.), the 
   Frog Boy (Felix Duarte), the Alligator Girl (Ester Blackmon) and the 
   infamous Popeye (Willie Ingram), a tall black man who can pop his 
   eyes out of their sockets (I swear I threw up in my mouth a little!). 
   Some university students (Julie Ege and Jill Haworth) and a visiting 
   professor (Brad Harris) become suspicious when their friend Tony 
   (Scott Anthony) turns up missing after visiting the freak show. After 
   operating on Tony and transforming him into a walking Venus Flytrap 
   mutation (who escapes), Nolter shows his true colors: a meglomaniac 
   who cares only about his results and nothing about human life. After 
   he has Lynch kidnap Ege for another experiment, his escaped mutation 
   comes back for some payback. Not to be outdone, when Lynch shows his 
   contempt for the freaks, it ends up biting him in the ass. Originally

    FREEWAY MANIAC</A><A NAME="FreewayManiac"></A> (1987) -</B> Here's 
   the film in a nutshell: An escaped mental patient terrorizes and 
   kills the cast and crew who are filming a low-budget sci-fi flick in 
   the middle of the desert. Yeah, I know. Big deal. The psychopath, 
   Arthur (James Courtney), who has severe mother issues (We watch him, 
   as a child, kill his slutty mother and her one night stand white 
   trash boyfriend with a butcher knife), escapes from the loony bin 
   rather easily (this mental hospital has the worst security ever!) and 
   begins his path of death and destruction. He kills a guy walking his 
   dog, steals his car and drives towards the desert. At the same time, 
   a young model/actress named Linda (Loren Winters) comes home early to 
   find her boyfriend screwing another woman. Hurt deeply, she hops in 
   her car and drives blindly into the desert, where her car breaks down 
   and she is forced to walk to the nearest gas station, a ramshackle 
   dive run by the lecherous Ray (Jeff Morris). When Ray puts the moves 
   on her, Linda runs away, right into the arms of Arthur, who decided 
   to stop for gas. Arthur murders Ray and tries to do the same to 
   Linda, but she fights him off (by hitting him with a car) an<A HREF="freeway_maniac_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/freeway maniac vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="152" HEIGHT="267" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>d
    escapes to safety. Linda becomes a local celebrity when Arthur is 
   recaptured; he grows more and more obsessed with Linda the more she 
   is profiled for her bravery on the TV news. Linda uses her new-found 
   fame to secure a starring role in a cheap sci-fi film and when Arthur 
   catches wind of her new fame, thanks to newspapers and daily news 
   reports, he goes full-tilt bozo and escapes the asylum again 
   (Everyone that works there should be fired for incompetence, not only 
   for letting him escape again, but also for supplying him with 
   newspapers and TV that feeds his obsession!). The Linda-obsessed 
   Arthur steals a big rig (after killing the driver), kills a bunch of 
   wise-ass teens in a pickup truck (by running them over) and then 
   heads towards the film shoot by foot once the truck breaks down, 
   stopping long enough to kill a couple necking in yet another pickup 
   truck and a couple of hikers. When the producer of the film, Bert 
   (Sheperd Sanders), and Linda's agent, Steven (Donald Hotton; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#OneDarkNight">ONE
    DARK NIGHT</A></B> - 1982), are notified that Arthur has escaped, 
   they decide not to tell Linda for strictly personal financial 
   reasons. As more cast and crew of the film shoot end up missing, 
   Linda's cheating boyfriend arrives on the set and saves Linda from 
   the clutches of Arthur. Or does he? Thankfully, the threat of a 
   sequel never materialized.&nbsp; The best way to describe this 
   low-budget horror film with one simple word?: Lacking. The only thing 
   this film has going in it's favor is some female nudity, as the rest 
   of the film is dreary, from it's one-note villain, the terrible 
   acting, the static camera work and the dearth of any notable gore. 
   Director/co-producer Paul Winters (<B><A HREF="red_blood_2001.htm">RED
    BLOOD</A></B> - 2001), who also co-wrote the screenplay with master 
   of the macabre illustrator Gahan Wilson, misses every opportunity 
   possible to offer the audience something to like or at least find 
   interesting. The killings are mostly bloodless, with the camera 
   pulling away rather than focusing-in on the blood and gore. The sad 
   fact is that the little snippets we see of the film-within-the-film 
   seem infinitely more enjoyable than the actual film itself. At no 
   time does Arthur seem like someone who could scare a ten year-old, 
   never mind an adult. He looks and talks like some regular Joe, yet he 
   survives getting shot, being thrown off the hood of a speeding car 
   and other situations that would kill, or at least maim, a normal 
   person. I love where films like this try to get away with making 
   their villains superhuman or supernatural for the mere fact that 
   they've spent most of their lives in a mental institution. It seems 
   to me they would be the exact opposite, weak and slow. Basically, <B><A HREF="freeway_maniac_1987b.htm">THE
    FREEWAY MANIAC</A></B> is a complete bore, offering nothing new or 
   remotely interesting to it's intended audience. This is an 
   anti-horror horror film that's a slap in the face to anyone who 
   watches it. Gahan Wilson (who designed the film's only funny prop, 
   the &quot;Sand Clam&quot; used in the film-within-the-film) would 
   rather we all forget this film was made (he refuses to talk about 
   it). Follow his advice. Robert Bloch and Stan Lee are thanked in the

   (1971), American International Picture wanted their own &quot;nature

   the first real true 70's &quot;nature gone amuck&quot; film because 
   it actually dealt with man's inhumanity to &quot;lower&quot; species, 
   polluting their grounds until they just had nothing else to do but 
   retaliate. This was a huge success for A.I.P. (who kind of misled

   (Adam Roarke; <B><A HREF="dirty_mary_crazy_larry_1974.htm">DIRTY MARY

   equipment when his canoe overturns, so, after he pulls Clint in the 
   water (Clint knows he deserves it), he and Karen take Pickett to the 
   island owned by Clint &amp; Karen's perpetually drunk 
   wheelchair-bound father Jason Crockett (Ray Milland; an Academy

   with, to put it politely), as well as black maid Maybelle (Mae

   and butler Charles (Lance Taylor, Sr.; <B><A HREF="blacula_1972.htm">BLACULA</A></B> 
   - 1972) who have served Jason for years. When the perpetually drunk 
   Jason finds out that Pickett is an ecologist, he hires him to find 
   out why so many frogs (of every type) are swarming on his island 
   (some of the bullfrogs are as large as a cat) and also to see if he 
   can find one of his employees who was searching for the downed wire 
   of the telephone service, since the phones aren't working in the 
   mansion right now. It's not very long before Pickett discovers that 
   there is more than a frog problem on this island. as he finds the 
   dead body of Jason's employee, with swarms of snakes of every type 
   crawling all over his body (which is unheard of in nature). Pickett 
   flips the body of the employee, where we get a good look at his 
   snake-bitten swollen face, one of the first instances of where this 
   would never pass for a PG Rating today. Pickett decides to keep the 
   man's death a secret between just him and Jason, because he does not 
   want to panic anyone, but it is apparent that the reptiles and 
   insects want to take over the island. Pickett believes Mother Nature 
   is in a state of revolt because of the way we are abusing her, as the 
   big-assed frogs jump at the windows and deadly snakes hang from a 
   chandelier (Jason just pulls out his pistol and nonchalantly shoots 
   it!). Even tough most of the family wants to leave to island, Jason 
   demands that they stay, because tomorrow is his birthday and &quot;We 
   are the ugly rich!&quot;. A romance begins brewing between Karen and 
   Pickett as they celebrate Jason's birthday, but Jay and Tina think it 
   will be funny to scare some frogs by throwing firecrackers at them 
   (They will soon learn that it is not funny at all). Since the phone 
   still isn't working, Stuart takes the Jeep and follows the phone line 
   down the road until he can find the break in the line. while Pickett 
   does some exploring of the island of his own (where he discovers many 
   instances of nature out of balance). Stuart steps out of the Jeep to 
   shoot a pheasant he sees in the air and when he goes to recover the 
   body, he trips and shoots himself in his knee with the shotgun. While 
   he is on the ground writhing in pain, hundreds of spiders spin a web 
   around him like a cocoon until he is unable to move. He is then 
   bitten to death by the spiders (good macro-photography of a real 
   spider's mouth as it is about to bite) and is then covered completely 
   by webs so no one can find him (I'm sure he'll make a good meal for 
   all these spiders). Kenneth is the next to die when he is in the 
   greenhouse and lizards of every kind (including Gila monsters) knock 
   some poison off a shelf and Kenneth dies of asphyxiation due to the 
   poisonous gas that quickly fills up the greenhouse. As Bella and 
   Pickett discover his body, the frog population starts to grow 
   enormously, so it is apparent that the deaths will be coming a lot 
   quicker. Iris is killed while butterfly hunting while she is soused. 
   She is nearly attacked by snakes, but she manages to get away, only 
   to land in a bog and be covered with leeches (as she is pulling the 
   bloody buggers off her face, we are again reminded how this would 
   never pass with a PG Rating today). She is then bitten by a 
   rattlesnake and dies, while the frogs watch. (It was originally 
   filmed that she dies in a pool of quicksand while chasing 
   butterflies, but it was deemed too ridiculous for the movie, but you 
   can still see that death in the film's theatrical trailer, which is 
   included on the Blu-Ray). Michael searches for Iris, only to be 
   killed and eaten by a bunch of alligators, as the frogs gleefully 
   watch and croak away (The stunt man substituting for Michael wrestles 
   a real alligator). We then see his bloody body being dragged away by 
   an alligator, another scene you would never see in a PG film today. 
   Karen, once again, wants to leave the island, but Jason will not let 
   anything or anybody ruin his special day. Pickett wants everyone off 
   the island, but Jason once asserts his authority again, only allowing 
   Bella, Maybelle and Charles to leave (he fires both Maybelle and 
   Charles, even though they have given the better portions their lives 
   serving him), instructing Clint to return the speedboat once he drops 
   them off at the dock on the other end of the lake. When they arrive 
   at the dock, they find it strangely empty and full of frogs, as 
   Bella, Maybelle and Charles are attacked by birds, their fates still 
   unknown. Clint is at the dock when he notices the speedboat's mooring 
   rope has been chewed through and the boat is several hundred yards 
   out in the lake. He jumps in the lake to swim to the boat, but he 
   doesn't make it, as first something bites him under the water and 
   then a deadly cottonmouth snake bites him just as he is about to get 
   into the boat, killing him. Jenny sees all this happen while she is 
   watching through binoculars at the lake's edge, but her feet get 
   stuck in the mud and she is killed by a large snapping turtle. 
   Pickett, Karen and the kids escape by using the canoe, but it becomes 
   snagged on something, forcing Pickett to get out of the canoe and 
   free whatever it is stuck on. Several cottonmouths try to bite him, 
   but he fights them off and frees the canoe and they make it to the 
   other dock (he fires a shotgun and kills an alligator following 
   them). They notice how extremely quiet it is (Pickett discovers 
   Bella's suitcase destroyed and knows that she, Maybelle and Charles 
   are dead). A stubborn Jason stays alone in his mansion, as the frogs 
   break the windows and invade the mansion (He even thinks the phone is 
   ringing, but there is nothing but croaking on the other end of the 
   line. Man, these are smart frogs!). He falls out of his wheelchair,

   and killer bee films out of this because I consider them completely 
   different genres). There were literally dozens of these films made in 
   the 70's (I've barely scratched the surface in my choice of titles) 
   and in nearly all the cases, it was man who turned these species 
   against us. The 70's was an ecology-minded decade (where the 80's was 
   all about &quot;Me! Me! Me!&quot;) and then we became more concerned 
   with terrorists with politicians turning their backs on the ecology 
   (and global warming) and instilling a different fear into the 
   population: The fear that your next door neighbor could be a 
   terrorist. This is why the films made in the 70's had much more meat 
   to them and were meaningful, if a little myopic (They were very 
   serious issues back then, but playing armchair quarterback today, 
   nothing much became of them). Director George McCowan (who passed 
   away in 1995) was mainly known as a TV director, directing episodes 
   of plenty of TV series while occasionally turning out a TV Movie (the 
   under-appreciated <B><A HREF="love_war_1970.htm">THE LOVE WAR</A></B>

   make films like <B><A HREF="shadow_of_the_hawk_1976.htm">SHADOW OF

   insect attacks connected together by the thinnest of plots (Mainly, 
   Ray Milland acting like a bully), but it is a well-made film that 
   doesn't overstay its welcome. Originally released on VHS by Warner

   reptiles and insects were used in the making of this. No cheap CGI or 
   anamatronic puppets. If you like horror films from the 70's (don't 
   worry about the PG Rating because, back in the 70's, the rating was

    -</B> Simply horrid Canadian horror film with enough plot 
   inconsistencies to fill a book. After a rather atmospheric opening 
   where we watch Dan Kentley (Blake Retter), who looks like he is 
   turning into something inhuman (one of his eyes is yellow and his 
   body is full of black sores and veins), throwing a young girl into a 
   lake and something grabs her, we then switch to the film proper, 
   which goes downhill so fast, you'll feel as if you're watching a 
   soapbox derby. Unmarried couple Sam (Lauren Watson) and Jason (Jamie 
   Temple) drive to the desolated farmhouse (you can tell this movie is 
   Canadian because they use the word &quot;kilometers&quot; instead of 
   &quot;miles&quot;) of her sister Elizabeth, husband (who is Dan 
   Kentley) and two young daughters, who have started an internet 
   business and want solitude. They get to the house and find it empty, 
   so they follow a path outside in which they find a creepy barn and 
   then go further, where the path ends at the lake we saw at the 
   beginning of the film. They decide to take a swim in the lake (even 
   though when they were in the barn we could see their breath, telling 
   us it <A HREF="from_beneath_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/from beneath poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>was
    freezing outside), strip down to their underwear (don't expect any 
   nudity because there isn't any) and jump in. When they get out, Jason 
   spots a leech-like creature crawling on Sam's back, so he knocks it 
   off and steps on it. That's when he notices that he has one of those 
   creatures crawling inside his leg. They go back to the house and Sam 
   dresses the wound on Jason's leg, they make love (Really?) and she 
   tells him that she loves him, but he can't say it back (he has 
   committment issues due to something that happened in his childhood). 
   The wound becomes more and more infected, causing the same types of 
   black veins on his leg as we saw on Dan's body. Sam tries to call for 
   an ambulance on a land line in one of the many phones in the house 
   (her cell phone doesn't work because they are in a dead zone, one of 
   the oldest excuses in a horror film since cell phones became 
   commonplace), but the lines are dead, so they decide to drive back to 
   civilization. Of course, the car doesn't work (another horror film 
   stereotype), so they go back to the house, where Jason begins 
   hallucinating and tries to strangle Sam a couple of times. Rather 
   than running away, Sam stays with Jason because he finally says 
   &quot;I love you&quot; (C'mon now!), as his leg becomes more and more 
   infected. They notice a locked door and find the key under a 
   waterproof flashlight. They open the door and find Elizabeth's 
   decomposing body. Jason talks Sam into moving the body out of the 
   house and leave it by the lake (He doesn't want it to be put where 
   Sam can see it out the window!). Jason finally becomes a monster 
   while Sam goes back to the lake, where she finds a sign hidden under 
   the grass that says the lake is off limits for swimming due to 
   biological contamination (The closest you'll ever find out exactly 
   what these creatures are). When she goes back to the house, Jason 
   knocks her out and carries her back to the lake, where tentacles grab 
   Sam on her leg and begin dragging her underwater. Noticing that 
   bright light seems to be the creatures (and Jason's) kryptonite, she 
   uses the flashlight on the tentacles and on Jason, getting out of the 
   water in the nick of time. For just a moment, Jason become human 
   again, grabs the flashlight and jumps into the lake, where we see a 
   blast of bright light and nothing else. At the finale, Sam discovers 
   she is pregnant, lifts up her shirt and has black veins on her 
   stomach. She screams. THE END. I can't begin to tell you how bad this 
   film is, but I can tell you who to blame. His name is David Doucette 
   and he directed, wrote, co-produced, did the cinematography and 
   edited this hellish effort, every one for the first time on a 
   feature-length film (it clocks in at a scant 82 minutes and the end 
   credits only last for about 30 seconds because the majority of names 
   are Doucette's. It doesn't even have a copyright date.). His 
   screenplay for this ultra-low-budget effort is the biggest problem of 
   the film and contains so many holes, it would make a swarm of moths 
   in a sweater factory jealous. The biggest hole is why there are no 
   computers in Sam's sister's house when they are running an internet 
   business? Not one single computer is seen (not to mention not a 
   single TV), probably because the budget wouldn't allow it, so why 
   doesn't the screenplay give the family another reason for living 
   there? There is a small digital camcorder that Sam finds in one of 
   her neice's bedroom that details what happened to her sister and 
   family, but it doesn't add anything to further the plot. And since 
   bright light seems to kill these creatures, wouldn't the sun hitting 
   the lake qualify as a bright light? While basically a two character 
   film, these are two people that deserve their fates because they do 
   things that just defy reason (especially moving the corpse of the 
   sister and not noticing her car is covered by brush). There's very 
   little blood or gore; just close-ups of Jason's leg wound as it gets 
   worse, dripping green puss and Jason hallucinating a couple of times 
   where blood flows out of Sam's mouth. The acting is also a step below 
   amateurish (Lauren Watson has had uncredited bit parts in films like <B><A HREF="rise_of_the_planet_of_the_apes_2011.htm">RISE
    OF THE PLANET OF THE APES</A></B> [2011], but everyone else here is 
   an acting virgin) and the sound recording is technically sub-par. Do 
   yourself a favor and spend the 82 minutes doing something else, like 
   trying to clip the nails of a rabid raccoon while blindfolded. 
   Anything you do would be better than watching this boring mess. Also 
   starring Bella Hawkesboyd as the corpse of Elizabeth. A <A HREF="http://midnightreleasing.com">Midnight

   stepmom Trish (Laura Allen; <B><A HREF="4400_tv_series.htm">THE 4400</A></B>

   Natalie tells Lindsay that a strange woman has been following her 
   since her boyfriend offed himself and to tell Bernard to check 
   outside. A few seconds later, Natalie is found dead with a pair of 
   scissors sticking out of her neck, another apparent suicide. Since 
   Natalie and her boyfriend were the goth couple in town, no one 
   (besides her father) makes too much of the suicides, but it is 
   apparent to the viewer that something much more sinister is going on. 
   Later that night, Bernard is visited by some unseen form and is 
   killed, which will also be deemed a suicide since he is found hanging

   boyfriend Dylan beats-up Aidan and she drives Aidan home. This 
   doesn't sit too well with drunken stepmom Trish, who warns Lindsay to 
   stay away from Aidan and stick to her current boyfriend Dylan, who 
   also warns that &quot;this town takes care of its own.&quot; Lindsay 
   goes to Aidan's house to warn him about upcoming reprisals and she 
   meets Aidan's cousin, Sadie (Margo Harshman), who warns Aidan to keep 
   &quot;outsiders&quot; out of their business (there's a lot of 
   &quot;warning&quot; in this movie). Things get downright creepy when 
   Bernard's niece is visited by a spooky woman who slits her wrists on 
   some broken glass. The next day, Lindsay's best friend Claire 
   (Brittany Robertson) passes by the spooky woman's dead body and is 
   infected. A short while later, Claire gets into a car accident and is 
   burned alive.&nbsp; Trish witnesses the accident&nbsp; and becomes 
   infected. She is tricked into drinking a bottle of drain cleaner by

   opens with a real-life violent time in French history. In 2005, a 
   major race riot broke out on the streets of Paris due to the police 
   chasing two teens on a minor charge, which resulted in the teens 
   accidentally electrocuting themselves while trying to hide in a power 
   plant. Thousands of teens and other sympathizers protested in the 
   streets and eventually it turned into a violent riot, thanks once 
   again to the police mishandling the situation by using brutal 
   violence on the crowds (This film does play loose with the actual 
   facts, changing the riots to coincide with a volitile political 
   election). Within this background of violence in the streets, we meet 
   Yasmine (Karina Testa), who is three months pregnant and looking for 
   a safe way to get out of Paris. With her brother Sami (Adel 
   Bencherif) shot and bleeding during the riots, Yasmine calls 
   ex-boyfriend Alex (Aurelien Wiik), the unborn baby's father, for some

   to make sure that Tom and Farid are made to feel at home (This also

   both girls seem to love it). At the dinner table, Goetz feeds the 
   guys some mystery meat (thinking it is pork, Farid declines because 
   of his Muslim upbringing) and they then watch Goetz and his sisters 
   force-feed their comatose mother at the dinner table. Later that 
   night, Goetz's equally brawny and bald cop brother, Karl (Patrick 
   Legardes), tries to steal Tom and Farid's money bag, which results in 
   Tom being beaten with a pipe before getting a couple of fingers 
   blown-off with Karl's gun. Tom and Farid manage to escape in their 
   car, but Goetz runs them off the road and they crash down a mine 
   shaft. Goetz thinks they are dead, but Tom and Farid manage to get 
   out of the car and crawl through the mine shaft, only to have Tom's 
   head caved-in withy a sledgehammer by another one of Goetz's 
   bald-headed brothers, Hans (Joel Lefrancois). With Farid and his 
   trusty night-vision video camera trapped in the mine with crawling 
   cannibalistic dwellers chasing him, Yasmine and Alex arrive at the 
   inn and, you guessed it, are about to have a night they will never 
   forget, but only if they make it out alive. It seems that Goetz and 
   his rather large family are not only cannibals, they are also white 
   supremacists ruled over by their elderly father Von Geisler 
   (Jean-Pierre Jorris), an escaped Nazi from World War II, who wants to 
   make Yasmine &quot;pure&quot; so she can marry Karl and keep the 
   family bloodline flowing. Let the torture begin.&nbsp; 
   Director/screenwriter Xavier Gens (<B><A HREF="hitman_2007.htm">HITMAN</A></B> 
   - 2007; <B><A HREF="divide_2011.htm">THE DIVIDE</A></B> - 2011) may 
   have thrown a little historical accuracy into the horror mix, but 
   when all is said and done (and yes, I do get the irony that the 
   &quot;frontier&quot; is more dangerous than the riot-torn streets of 
   Paris), it's easy to see that Gens fashioned his film on the 
   unexpected success of <B><A HREF="#Hostel">HOSTEL</A></B> (2005). 
   It's obvious that the second half of the film exists solely to show 
   human beings being mistreated and tortured in the worst ways 
   possible, whether it is Tom hanging upside down, suspended by his 
   ankles that are impaled on curved blades (he eventually has his 
   throat cut and bleeds out); Farid being caught in a huge pressure 
   cooker and slowly roasted to death (Yum!); Alex having his achilles' 
   tendons sliced with a huge set of tongs; or a pregnant Yasmine having 
   to swin through pig shit to escape, but she is eventually recaptured, 
   has all her hair cut off (it is too dark for dear old Nazi dad) and 
   is forced to eat the cooked flesh of Alex. What about Yasmine's 
   unborn baby? Well, the film implies that she wants to keep it (she 
   did make a promise to a dying Sami) after she is brutally punched, 
   kicked and gun-butted, yet ends up killing most of the Nazi family 
   single-handedly (including a nasty buzzsaw death and biting a meaty 
   chunk out of Gilberte's neck). Whatever political statement Gens was 
   trying to make with this film gets lost in a flood of unflinching 
   bloodshed (nothing is left to the imagination), lots of 
   &quot;shakey-cam&quot; photography (especially in the first half) and 
   trying to humanize (not to mention feeling sorry for) some members of 
   the Nazi clan. It just doesn't wash. I don't like using the term 
   &quot;torture porn&quot;, but that is exactly what the second half of <B><A HREF="frontiers_2007c.htm">FRONTIER(S)</A></B> 
   is. Why the &quot;S&quot; is in parenthesis is a head-scratcher and 
   open to many interpretations. Mine would be that there are many such 
   places in the world (The actual name of the sign is 
   &quot;Frontiere&quot;, which is French for &quot;border&quot;) that 
   deal with this type of degradation and our group of unlucky victims 
   just happened upon one of them. Others believe the &quot;S&quot; 
   stands for the Nazi &quot;SS&quot;, but I find that explanation a 
   little hard to swallow. Or maybe it's just a French cultural thing 
   and has no purposeful meaning. Also starring Maud Forget and Rosine

    FUN PARK</A><A NAME="FunPark2007"></A> (2007) -</B> Regional 
   Oklahoma-lensed horror flick. When Wilson Creek police find a bloody 
   and bruised Megan Davis (Jillian Murray) on the side of the road, she 
   relates to them a story about five of her friends being murdered at 
   an abandoned amusement park; a story so brutal, the police have 
   problems believing her. And rightly so, since there is no evidence of 
   foul play at the Fun Park to back up her story and a background check 
   of Megan's past reveals that she hasn't had the best childhood and 
   may be suffering psychological problems because of it. That is not to 
   say that the Fun Park hasn't had its share of controversy in the 
   past. The story begins years earlier, when crazy mother Waureen 
   Renquist (Verna Vaughn) would physically and mentally abuse her son, 
   Kestor (Mike Leipart), forcing him to wear clown makeup and making 
   him perform private shows for her. When the police found out about 
   the abuse, they institutionalize Waureen (until she died) and Kestor 
   bounced from foster home to foster home until he was murdered twenty 
   years ago. So why does Megan i<A HREF="fun_park_2007.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/fun park dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>nsist
    that Kestor is responsible for the deaths of her five friends? That 
   question falls into the lap of Megan's court-appointed psychiatrist, 
   Dr. Marissa Jade (Jennifer Ferguson), who must separate the fact from 
   fiction. She investigates Kestor's past and discovers that when he 
   became an adult, he still wore the clown makeup and called himself 
   Bobo, working at the Fun Park as a water-dunking clown for several 
   years, where he was quite popular (even with the ladies). Then, for 
   some unknown reason, Kestor snapped and murdered the judge that 
   committed his mother to the insane asylum (Kestor was found wearing 
   the judge's face!). He was then committed to the same asylum as his 
   dead mother, but he soon escaped and DNA blood evidence found at the 
   Fun Park revealed that Kestor was dead, even though his body was 
   never found (that's never a good sign). The Fun Park was closed down 
   for good and it remained shut down until Megan told her horrible 
   story (and if it is true, Kestor is now 55 to 60 years old). Dr. Jade 
   has a session with Megan and the film switches to a series of 
   flashbacks mixed with the current session. We learn that Megan's 
   mother was a whore and she never knew her father. We also learn that 
   Dr. Jade has recently suffered a miscarriage and this is her first 
   case since losing her baby. As more flashbacks reveal what actually 
   happened to Megan and her five friends at the abandoned Fun Park, 
   including her boyfriend Justin (Randy Wayne), who is moving far away 
   to attend college, it becomes clear to the viewers that what we see 
   through Megan's eyes and mind may not be as cut and dried as it 
   seems. Will Dr. Jade be able to separate fact from fantasy or is 
   Megan doomed to spend the rest of her life in a rubber room? Perhaps 
   a video camera found at the scene of the crimes will clear things 
   up?&nbsp; This is by no means a normal modern day horror film. It is 
   more like a picture puzzle that the viewer must piece together as the 
   film progresses; the only problem being is that two or more pieces of 
   the puzzle may fit into the same empty slot, so we must decide which 
   piece actually belongs there. Director/screenwriter/co-producer Rick 
   Walker (an Oklahoma radio DJ whose only other film is the 2002 love 
   story <B><A HREF="sam_and_janet_2002.htm">SAM &amp; JANET</A></B>) 
   does a good job keeping the audience guessing, but there are many 
   long stretches where nothing really happens, especially when the 
   flashbacks take us to Megan and her five friends at the Fun Park 
   during that fateful night. We are treated to so many false 
   &quot;jump&quot; scares during this sequence that when we actually 
   get to the violence, it loses its effectiveness. There are also a few 
   huge leaps in logic (The biggest one being: Why would an abandoned 
   amusement park closed for the last twenty years still have 
   electricity and working video games?), the gore quotient is pretty 
   low (those expecting a non-stop bloodbath will be bitterly 
   disappointed) and the flashback scenes are lensed using a sickly 
   green filter (making it look like it was shot through a bottle of 
   Mountain Dew), but for the most part <B><A HREF="fun_park_2007b.htm">THE
    FUN PARK</A></B> is just different enough to merit a rental even if 
   the final denouement is a cop-out. As far as psychological horror 
   films go, this one gets a few extra points for its somewhat unique 
   story structure (the ambient noise soundtrack and the dialogue-less 
   killings during the flashbacks are sure to raise a few goosebumps).

    FURY OF THE WOLFMAN</A><A NAME="Fury Of Wolfman"></A> (1970) -</B> 
   This is the third, and weakest, of Waldemar Daninsky's (Paul Naschy) 
   werewolf sagas thanks to the lazy direction of Jose Maria Zabalza 
   (who, according to Naschy, was drunk through most of the filming) and 
   the soap opera-like plot (by screenwriter Naschy, using his real name 
   Jacinto Molina). Professor Waldemar Daninsky (here renamed 
   &quot;Walter&quot; for it's American release) returns from his trip 
   to Tibet afflicted with lycanthropy, a pentagram burned into his 
   chest. He finds out from fellow teacher Dr. Ilona Elmann (Perla 
   Cristal) that his wife Erika (Pilar Zorrilla) has been having an 
   affair. At first, Waldemar doesn't believe Ilona (who secretly is in 
   love with him), but when his car's brakes are tampered with and he 
   gets into a serious accident, he comes around. He goes home, turns 
   into a werewolf, bites Erika and kills her lover. He then runs amok 
   and is electrocuted by a power line. Everyone but Ilona thinks 
   Waldemar is dead, so they bury him. Ilona has him dug up and brings 
   him back to her laboratory, where she straps him to a table and begins<A HREF="fury_of_the_wolfman_1970.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/fury of the wolfman vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="124" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   experimenting on him, hoping to cure him of his werewolfism and turn 
   him into one of her loyal zombies. Meanwhile, the police and a nosy 
   reporter are investigating Daninsky's death and the subsequent grave 
   robbery. While Ilona performs her experiments, Waldemar&nbsp; turns 
   into a werewolf. She chains him to a wall and tries to whip the 
   werewolf out of him but he escapes and kills a university student and 
   nearly kills a young woman going to bed, but stops himself. He does 
   manage to kill a husband and his wife in their kitchen, though. The 
   police use dogs to track Daninsky, but lose his scent when he turns 
   back into a human. Waldemar and new friend Karen (Veronica Lujan) try 
   to escape Ilona's lab and find her hidden basement of failed 
   experiments. They set them free and then find Ilona's diary, where 
   Waldemar learns that Ilona has set him up from the start. His wife 
   Erika is now a werewolf and is under Ilona's control. As with all of 
   the Daninsky films, it ends rather badly for nearly everyone.&nbsp; 
   This film makes absolutely no sense (How does Waldemar break his 
   chains? Why does he go back to Ilona's lab after he has just escaped 
   from it?) and, therefore is enjoyable for all the wrong reasons. It 
   jumps all over the place and I'm still trying to wrap my head around 
   the orgy scenes, Waldemar's fight with a man in shiny armor (what the 
   fuck?) and the purpose of Ilona's experiments. Characters pop in and 
   then disappear, never to be seen again. Ilona's basement of freaks 
   and failed experiments is another head-scratcher. Why would Karen and 
   Waldemar set them free only to fight and kill most of them a few 
   minutes later? If you're looking for answers, don't bother, as there 
   aren't any. There's an unbelievable trite scene near the end of the 
   film where the reporter gets all the answers he needs by asking some 
   previously unseen girl questions in a bar. It's just lazy writing as 
   it tries to tie up all the loose ends with a 30 second scene. The 
   fight between Waldemar and Erika in the finale elicits grins rather 
   than fright. Storywise, this is the worst film in the series and 
   director Zabalza adds nothing of worth visually to the film, probably 
   because he was hammered for the entire shoot. It's also very light in 
   the blood and nudity department, but this could be because the print 
   I viewed came from Avco Embassy (the version titled <B>WEREWOLF NEVER SLEEPS</B> 
   purportedly has more blood and nudity). It's not a TV print, though,

   and ambushes them, causing the inmates to crash the truck, not only 
   killing them but also drenching them in spilled formaldahyde. The 
   warden orders the other inmates to bury them (in what has to be the 
   shallowest graves ever committed to film) and to keep their mouths 
   shut. Wouldn't you know it? The dead inmates rise from their dirt 
   blankets to exact revenge for their deaths. Their only weakness: 
   Light. Any kind of light. Flashlights, headlights, lightbulbs, etc. 
   While the living population of the prison camp try to keep the 
   generator going, the formaldahyde zombies pick them off one-by-one. 
   Where do I start to describe what's wrong with this dizzying exercize 
   in ineptitude? For starters, there's no blood! I've often heard 
   rumors that there's a longer version available, but so far that's all 
   it is: a rumor. The version I viewed is rated PG and it does show 
   some jump cuts which does make me believe that it's edited. Garden 
   tools are shown thrusting down on the victims but never hitting them. 
   If you look closely, you can see blood on the garden tools. That's 
   all the blood on view here. The zombies are another cheap creation. 
   This was an early job for Joe Blasco (who created and played the 
   creature in <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Track Moonbeast">TRACK OF 
   THE MOONBEAST</A></B> - 1972) and it looks like he slapped some 
   green-gray makeup on their faces and blackened out their eyes. Their 
   hands look completely normal. The disintegration scenes consist of 
   the zombies letting an Alka-Seltzer dissolve in their mouths. Add to 
   that: a prison a blind man could escape from; total lapses of logic, 
   reason or continuity and absolutely no foul language or sex and you 
   come up with a film that should be viewed only while under the 
   influence of a controlled substance (formaldahyde will do). Directed 
   rather shabbily by the late John Hayes, who has done much better. See <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Dream No Evil">DREAM

   (1988) -</B> You know a film is in trouble when it opens with a 
   dedication to the memory of Lucio Fulci. The problem is, Lucio Fulci 
   was still alive in 1988! The Texas-lensed film then proceeds with a 
   voiceover by lead actress Tamara Hext, who plays Sandra Curtis, where 
   she says such mind-numbing things as, &quot;In the morning, my sister 
   will still be dead.&quot; I certainly hope so! As this regional 
   no-budgeter moves ahead, it's easy to see that the filmmakers try to 
   emulate Fulci's style (it even has two guys on phones speaking 
   English-subtitled Italian), but only Fulci could do Fulci and even 
   then, he had a hard time doing it. I will give this film some proper 
   respect for being confusing as an 80's Fulci film, as this whole 
   production has a disjointed feel to it; like it is nothing but a 
   series of unrelated scenes edited together. Supposedly, this is a 
   film about &quot;separate realities&quot;, as one minute we see 
   Sandra's sister, Marilyn (Tracy Baldwin), waiting by her car on some 
   dark, deserted road, when someone in a car pulls next to her and then 
   we switch to two guys&nbsp; (one of them wearing a &quot;Dallas Naval 
   Air Station&quot; trucker cap) who are rock climbing and discover a 
   corpse before both of them are chased and killed by a grunting demon. 
   We <A HREF="gates_of_hell_2_dead_awakening_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/gates of hell ii dead awakening dvd front2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="193" HEIGHT="281" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>then
    switch to three people in a bar discussing something bad (One guy 
   says, &quot;I don't like it. I think we should call this off.&quot; 
   While another guy says, &quot;It's too late.&quot;) and suddenly it 
   is five weeks later and Sandra is in a bar getting sloshed and has 
   the cops called on her for throwing a drink on the bartender. The 
   cop, Nick Berkley (Tom Campitelli), takes pity on her drunk ass and 
   drives her passed-out body home after rifling through her purse for 
   her address (and ogling her legs). Being a woman, Sandra takes 
   advantage of the situation and invites Nick to a bar the next night, 
   where she offers to pay him to work on his off-duty hours to find 
   Marilyn, who has been missing for (you guessed it) five weeks. Sandra 
   tells Nick about the nightmares she's been having since Marilyn went 
   missing, where she and Marilyn are standing on the top of a cliff and 
   Marilyn falls down it. Nick agrees to help her and immediately takes 
   a week's vacation (I guess that's how long it takes to find a missing 
   person in Texas).&nbsp; We then cut to an ominous group of men (all 
   shown in extreme close-up, probably because the budget couldn't 
   afford a set) discussing a bad situation and saying stuff like, 
   &quot;We called it to serve us!&quot; We then switch to a security 
   guard in a warehouse calling his wife and then listening to her being 
   murdered over the phone. What The Fuck?!? When Sandra and Nick check 
   out Marilyn's office (she was a travel agent), they find a mysterious 
   medallion and get paid a visit by the even more mysterious Randy 
   Sternman (Randy Strickland), who is looking for Marilyn. Meanwhile, 
   the group of ominous men continue to make arcane statements about 
   &quot;conjuring demons&quot; and then one of them is hit over the 
   head by a flying Bible. More confusing shit happens, like a mother 
   being killed in her garage by the demon while her two young boys 
   watch. Sandra and Nick begin questioning the relatives of the other 
   missing people in the area, including those of the two missing rock 
   climbers, and come up with an important clue on the rock climbers' 
   map. How will all of this tie together? Will it all tie together? Why 
   are things always bigger in Texas? And why doesn't a Hebrew demon 
   know better than to go on a killing spree in Texas, especially since 
   every citizen owns a gun, an automatic rifle and a couple of 
   grenades?&nbsp; There's not so much an air of a Fulci influence here 
   that I could detect, except for an air of mass confusion. The film 
   (also known as <B><A HREF="through_the_fire_1988.htm">THROUGH THE FIRE</A></B>),
    directed by G.D. Marcum (his only film as director), bears very 
   little resemblance to Fulci's original <B><A HREF="gates_of_hell_1980.htm">GATES
    OF HELL</A></B> (a.k.a. <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CityLivingDead1980">CITY
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> - 1980), as that film was full of blood 
   and gore, something this film severely lacks (Not to mention that the 
   camera turns away just as things are about to get bloody). The 
   screenplay, by Marcum and Brad Potter, bites off way more than its 
   paltry budget could ever hope to chew and the only Fulci-inspired 
   moment, where Nick and Sandra are attacked by evil forces at a 
   s&eacute;ance held by P.J. (Billie Carroll) is ruined by cheap 
   optical effects. Everything about this film screams out poverty, from 
   the muffled sound recording, bare-bone sets, stupid stabs at comedy 
   (there's a dead cat in P.J.'s freezer and Nick ignores it and reaches 
   for an ice cream bar instead; Nick tries to commandeer a citizen's 
   car, only for the citizen to pull a gun on him) and poorly-blocked 
   action scenes. Christ, even when Sandra takes a shower, we see no 
   nudity! Fulci would have been spinning in his grave if he were 
   actually dead at the time. If you decide to dedicate a film to his 
   memory, you better deliver, but it takes more than some fog and a 
   couple of fake-ass zombies to achieve that goal. Also starring Dan 
   Shackleford, John Davies, Wendy Wade, Terry Wegner, Martin Smith, 
   Lourdes Regala and Dan Robbins. A Creatures Features VHS Release and

    GAME</A><A NAME="GhostGame"></A> (2005) -</B> Let me know if you 
   heard this one before: A group of idiotic college students (with the 
   combined IQ of a small rock) rent a remote cabin on the middle of an 
   island only accessible by canoe, where, thirty years earlier, a trio 
   of teenage witches were murdered after performing some magical 
   ceremony. The remainder of the film intercuts past and present, as we 
   slowly learn what the three witches were actually doing at the cabin 
   and how it affects the college students now staying there. Dara 
   (Alexandra Barreto; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#ToothAndNail">TOOTH 
   AND NAIL</A></B> - 2007) finds a diary at the cabin, but the last few 
   pages are torn out. That's too bad, because if those pages were still 
   in there, these stupid college kids (did I mention they had the 
   combined IQ of a toenail?), which also includes Nate (Peter Cilella), 
   his girlfriend Abbey (Shelby Fenner), wise-ass Randy (Curt 
   Cornelius), Cousin Ted (Robert Berson, who became a millionaire by 
   copyrighting the word &quot;extreme&quot; (and every alternate 
   spelling of the word!), Sebastian (Aaron Freeman) and his obnoxious 
   girlfriend Talia (Danielle Hartnett), would never do what they are 
   about to do (again: combined IQ &lt; -1). They find a metal box in a 
   closet and open it, only to find an Ouija board-like device, a map 
   and one missing page of the diary <A HREF="ghost_game_2005.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ghost game dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="207" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>with
    &quot;Don't Play This Game!&quot; written on it. Instead of heeding 
   this dire warning, Cousin Ted starts palying the game, which releases 
   the spirits of the three witches, who begin killing the college 
   students. Nate is the first to be killed (choked to death) and Randy 
   is drowned after finding that the canoes are missing and trying to 
   swim for help. Dara, Abbey and Cousin Ted figure out the only way to 
   survive is to finish the game, which isn't a game at all, but a 
   Wiccan ceremony, the same ceremony performed by the three witches 
   thirty years earlier. Sebastian is stabbed to death while having sex 
   with Talia, which leaves only four lives left. The quartet must find 
   a number of objects that are drawn on the map found in the metal box 
   and place those objects around a metal pole that acts like a moondial 
   (it lets our students know how much time they have left). Skanky 
   Talia dies next (she's impaled through the neck and stomach by tree 
   branches), so Dara stays by the moondial while Abbey and Cousin Ted 
   look for the remaining objects. Abbey is the next to die (she has her 
   neck broken with a piece of rope) and before the film is over, both 
   Cousin Ted (the only non-teen in the group, yet he's the only 
   virgin!) and Dana will also be dead. Groundskeeper Simon Brady (Eric 
   Scott Woods) buries all the bodies and waits for the next group to 
   rent the cabin. It seems Mr. Brady has been doing this for many years 
   and even makes some money on the side by selling the cars of those 
   unlucky enough not to return from their canoe trips (try not to think 
   too hard or you'll realize the absurdity of it all). I hope this 
   doesn't mean there's gonna be a sequel? Father, Son, Holy Ghost, make 
   it stop!&nbsp; Competently made, but boring to the extreme and 
   illogical as hell, <B><A HREF="ghost_game_2005b.htm">GHOST GAME</A></B> 
   suffers the same fate most of these modern DTV &quot;teens in 
   peril&quot; flicks are stricken with: Too much unfunny hipster 
   dialogue, an over-abundance of jackhammer-style editing (not to 
   mention that the flashback footage looks to have been filmed using 
   nightvision goggles) and not enough common sense.

   - 2007) seems to think that a little blood and nudity goes a long 
   way, but the fact is we watch these films to see lots of blood and 
   nudity, not the anemic amounts on view here. While the storyline had 
   possibilities (screenplay by Ben Oren, a staff writer for MTV's 
   now-defunct <B><A HREF="andy_milanokis_show_tv_series_2005-2007.htm">THE
    ANDY MILONAKIS SHOW</A></B> [2005 - 2007], which would explain the 
   juvenile humor spoken by the cast here), such as the mixing of past 
   and present in the narrative, the execution leaves a lot to be 
   desired. Not only are most of the deaths bloodless (two 
   strangulations, a drowning and a bloodless head-bashing), but the 
   comical dialogue spoken by the cast totally belies the situation they 
   are in. The most groan-inducing line is spoken by Talia when she 
   says, &quot;I thought he (Sebastian) was taking me to a spa!&quot; as 
   she lies dying with two tree branches impaled in her body (the film's 
   bloodiest effect). This film also suffers from a case of fatalism 
   that seems to be infecting many of the newer horror films. Just 
   because everyone dies by the film's conclusion, don't think that a 
   statement is being made. It's a cop-out that is used much too often 
   when a screenwriter can't come up with a proper ending and it just 
   comes off as a lazy way to end a film. Pretend you're a ghost and let 
   this one slip through your hands. Also starring Caroline D'Amore,

   (1987) -</B> This is a late entry in the Italian pantheon of haunted 
   house thrillers that flooded the VHS shelves in the 80's. This one is 
   directed by Umberto Lenzi using his Americanized &quot;Humphrey

   by locking her and her oversized clown doll in the dark basement. 
   Soon after, the father is killed by an axe to his head and the mother

    the clown's hand while all the lightbulbs and mirrors in the house 
   shatter. Twenty years later, Paul (Greg Scott) and Martha (Lara 
   Wendel) investigate a series of ominous radio messages that Paul is 
   picking up on his ham radio. They trace the signal to the site of the 
   murder house, which is now abandoned. They find a ham radio setup in 
   the attic which is owned by a family camping out in a trailer in the 
   back yard. It's not long before the house starts playing with the 
   unwelcome occupants as glass objects begin shattering, clocks shoot 
   fire and Martha sees a decapitated head in the washing machine. As 
   they investigate further, people begin to die, as Henriette (Kristen 
   Fougerousse) and her clown doll appear just before someone meets a 
   gruesome death. One has is throat slit by a flying fan blade. Another 
   is cut in half by a guillotine blade. Another nearly dissolves in a 
   pool of lye and is stabbed in the back with a pair of hedge clippers 
   by his own girlfriend who mistakens him for a supernatural demon. 
   Meanwhile, Paul and Martha dig into the history of the house and 
   discover that the only way to end this madness is to burn Henriette's 
   body, which is entombed in a local graveyard. A final stinger at the 
   end proves that it's not that simple.&nbsp; This Massachusetts-lensed 
   Italian production has a few good kills but nothing much else going 
   for it. The acting is poor and the pacing slow, which is the norm for 
   most Italian haunted house films (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Witchery">WITCHERY</A></B> 
   - 1988, immediately comes to mind). The scene where Martha is trapped 
   in Henriette's bedroom and is attacked by a flying Mickey Mouse is 
   the film's high point and should have raised Disney's ire. <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DoctorButcher1980">DOCTOR
    BUTCHER M.D.</A></B> (1980) himself, Donald O'Brien (here spelled

   portrayed as a hitch-hiking pompous asshole who annoys everyone he 
   meets with a mechanical corpse hand he keeps in his backpack. His 
   death is the only one not shown in detail. There's also plenty of 
   chuckle-inducing dialogue (courtesy of screenwriter Cinthia McGavin)

   to girlfriend Jenny's disgust. Jenny also has the feeling that they <A HREF="ghostkeeper_1980.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ghost keeper small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="121" HEIGHT="227" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>are
    not alone in this hotel. She is right. It is also occupied by an old 
   woman (Georgie Collins) and her weirdo son Danny (Billy Grove). She 
   is known as the Ghostkeeper and, unknown to our trapped trio, she 
   keeps a furry human-like creature locked-up in the ice cellar which 
   she must feed human flesh. The old woman also shows and unusual 
   interest in Jenny and Jenny in turn feels like she has been brought 
   to this hotel for some unknown purpose. Chrissie is abducted by Danny 
   while taking a bath. He drags her down to the ice cellar, slits her 
   throat and gives her to the creature. The next morning Marty goes 
   outside to find his snowmobile has been intentionally disabled and 
   Chrissie's snowmobile missing. While Marty tries to fix the 
   snowmobile, Jenny is drugged and brought to the cellar. She awakens 
   to find books on ancient Indian legends and old newspaper articles on 
   people found slaughtered at the hotel. She finds the locked ice 
   cellar, opens it and sees the creature. Before she can do anything 
   she is attacked by Danny with a chainsaw. A chase to the attic ensues 
   which results in Danny falling off the roof, impaling himself on the 
   wrought-iron fence below. Seeing this, Marty freaks out, paints his 
   face with grease and runs off into the woods! Jenny finds a shotgun, 
   confronts the old woman (who tells Jenny that she's her mother!) and 
   blows a hole in her belly. She then goes downstairs to the ice cellar 
   and tells the creature not to worry; she will take care of him now. 
   Jenny then finds Marty frozen to death in the woods. She is now the 
   Ghostkeeper and must now keep the creature fed.&nbsp; Based in part 
   on the Wendigo legend (here spelled &quot;Windigo), this little-seen 
   Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada-lensed horror film also shows that it 
   owes some of its' storyline to the then recently released <B><A HREF="shining_1980.htm">THE
    SHINING</A></B>. The authentic lush snow-filled landscapes and hotel 
   in the middle of nowhere reminds one of that film even if the

   (played by John MacMillan) is only viewed in the shadows to maintain 
   its effectiveness. The film does show some tampering in the editing 
   as nearly all scenes that show bloodshed are excised or trimmed. This 
   is odd since the tape's packaging carries no rating. Still, it's an 
   interesting little shocker which shouldn't disappoint fans of things

   beautiful Tatum Adair) has been taking care of her family ever since 
   her father was confined to a wheelchair. One night she decides she 
   needs a break and goes to a nightclub, where she meets a stranger and 
   screws his brains out in the back of his car. While this is happening 
   her parents are succumbing to a gas leak in the home and they both 
   die. Filled with guilt (and maybe seeing things that are not there), 
   Rebecca goes to her parents' cabin in Rushford Lake, NY (a real town) 
   to rest and recuperate. The only problem is, Rebecca is seeing 
   murders occur at the lake and talks to a little girl that no one else 
   sees. She slowly learns that the lake has a history that involves 
   people disappearing every 13 years. It seems that this is a man-made 
   lake and a whole town was submerged to make it. Some of the residents 
   did not make it out alive. So every 13 years the dead rise from the 
   lake and take 13 lives. Rebecca has picked the wrong year to 
   convalesce here. At first the local police think that she is just 
   plain crazy, but soon come around when they begin finding bodies in 
   the lake. Can Rebecca and the police stop more murders from 
   happening? You'll have to watch the film to find out for I do not 
   want to spoil the surprise. Filled with goosebump-inducing scenes of 
   the denizens of the lake decaying before your eyes, <B><A HREF="ghost_lake_2004c.htm">GHOST
    LAKE</A></B> is the kind of film that stays with you long after it 
   is over. The scene where Rebecca is confronted by a dead fisherman at 
   her door who has come to redeem himself only to be touched by the 
   hand of death is a classic of fright and effects.&nbsp; Director 
   Woelfel (who also wrote, composed the eerie, effective score and 
   plays the &quot;Shadowy Figure&quot;) has a winner here and should be 
   congratulated for making a horror film that does not compromise the 
   story for shocks (although there are plenty). Well done, Jay! Also

    TOWN</A><A NAME="GhostTown1988"></A> (1988) -</B> This supernatural 
   horror western was one of the best films to come out of Executive 
   Producer Charles Band's Empire Pictures during the late 80's, but, 
   just like everything Band touches, it had a troubled production 
   history. Director Richard Governor (his only film) walked off the set 
   two weeks before the film finished principal photography (apparently 
   due to an ever-changing unfinished script by Duke Sandefur [<B><A HREF="phantom_of_the_opera_1989.htm">THE
    PHANTOM OF THE OPERA</A></B> - 1989] and continuing interference 
   from Band), which forced Director of Photography Mac Ahlberg to take 
   over and finish it. It's surprising the film turned out so well, even 
   if some of the scenes look frazzled and others look unfinished. The 
   film opens with runaway bride Kate (Catherine Hickland; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Witchery">WITCHERY</A></B> 
   - 1988) driving through the Arizona desert when she comes up against 
   a downed telephone pole blocking the road. She exits onto a dirt road 
   to get around the blockage, but as she is driving, she can hear the 
   sounds of a horse's hoofs following close behind her, but she sees no 
   horse. Her car breaks down in the middle of nowhere and she is 
   suddenly abducted by someone on horseback, who appears in a strange 
   cloud of dust. Cra<A HREF="ghost_town_1988b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ghost town 1988 poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="186" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ck
    shot lawman Langley (Franc Luz; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Nest1987">THE
    NEST</A></B> - 1987) is assigned to find Kate when her car is 
   discovered abandoned on the side of the dirt road and it's so rusted, 
   crumbling and full of sand, it looks like it has been sitting there 
   for a hundred years. Langley is about to go on a long, strange trip, 
   where past and present collide. While looking for Kate in the desert, 
   Langley is attacked by the mysterious man on horseback and his police 
   vehicle (a Ford Bronco, which is used as a sly joke later in the 
   film) spontaneously combusts, forcing Langley to travel by foot. He 
   comes upon a headstone for a sheriff who was killed in 1870 and when 
   he lifts the headstone off the ground, the sheriff's rotting corpse 
   suddenly springs-up from underground, grabs Langley by his arms and 
   says, &quot;You're the one! You'll rid my town of evil. Don't fail or 
   risk a fate worse than death!&quot; The corpse then crumbles to dust 
   (Langley steals his badge) and Langley takes refuge in a nearby ghost 
   town when a torrential thunderstorm hits. He falls asleep and when he 
   wakes up the next morning, he begins searching the ghost town for 
   Kate (the audience is aware that she is there) and spots many things 
   that shouldn't be there, like rotting corpses littering the entire 
   town and meeting &quot;The Dealer&quot; (Bruce Glover; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Night Scarecrow">NIGHT
    OF THE SCARECROW</A></B> - 1994), a blind man who speaks in riddles 
   and percentages before suddenly disappearing. To make a long story 
   short, Langley becomes the new sheriff in town (he should have never 
   pinned the dead sheriff's badge to his chest) and must face-off 
   against ghost gunslinger Devlin (Jimmie F. Skaggs; <B><A HREF="oblivion_1994.htm">OBLIVION</A></B> 
   - 1994) and his gang. Devlin is holding (and raping) Kate and the 
   ghost town suddenly springs to undead life with the ghosts of the 
   residents who died there by Devlin's hands. Can Langley defeat Devlin 
   and his gang, put the residents of the ghost town at eternal peace 
   and return Kate to the present?&nbsp; While the plot hardly makes a 
   lick of sense, what this film does have in spades is a creepy 
   atmosphere that will chill you to the bone. A lot of it can be 
   attributed to Mac Ahlberg's excellent cinematography, but there are 
   scenes here that transcend the photography (such as prostitute Etta 
   [Laura Schaefer] suddenly being surrounded by Devlin's ghost gang on 
   a flight of stairs) and sets a mood that goes beyond creepy and 
   enters a new plateau. There are a few gory scenes on view, such as 
   Devlin getting shot in the cheek that leaves a gaping exit wound (as 
   well as Etta getting pitchforked to death, various slashed throats 
   and gun violence), but this is more a psychological horror film about 
   accepting the cards that are dealt to you and finishing the game on 
   terms that are not always in your favor. <B><A HREF="ghost_town_1988.htm">GHOST
    TOWN</A></B> falters somewhat in the final third (you can almost 
   spot the point where Governor walked off the set and Ahlberg took 
   over, not to mention suddenly completely dropping the secondary story 
   of Langley's boss trying to locate him and an ending that seems 
   rushed and incomplete), but don't let that discourage you from 
   searching-out this unusual film. It's worth the effort. Also starring 
   Penelope Windust, Zitto Kazann, Blake Conway and Michael Alldredge.

   - 1985) for airing on the local news. Eric is also a drunk, 
   chain-smoking, crank-sniffing piece of scum who will stoop as low as 
   possible to get the money shot. One night he spots three men dragging 
   a woman into an alley. He picks up his camera thinking that he is 
   about to film a rape in progress. He's in for a big surprise. What he 
   finds instead is the three men are actually ghouls and they are 
   tearing the woman apart, eating her guts and appendages. The ghouls 
   spot him, but Eric gets away and brings his camera to the news 
   director. There's only one problem: Eric, in his crank-induced, 
   booze-fueled stupor, forgot to put a cassette in the camera. The 
   director calls him a loser and throws him out. Eric enlists Clift 
   (Trent Haaga, also an associate producer), another crime videographer 
   (and probably the closest thing he has as a friend in this world 
   because Eric's girlfriend has just left him), to help him find these 
   ghouls and get them on tape. Clift gets captured by the ghouls and 
   Eric has his camera stolen (after getting shots of the ghouls) by a 
   retarded boy at a bus stop. Eric is then knocked-out and brought to 
   the sewers where the ghouls live. He spots Clift hanging by a hook, 
   the skin stripped from his body, but still alive. Eric uses the hook 
   to escape from the locked sewer room and, with a gun he had hidden on 
   his body, kills all the ghouls (including a mother ghoul and her 
   baby!). Back on the surface, Eric spots the retarded boy with his 
   video camera and beats him up and takes the camera back. He goes back 
   to the news director with footage of what he thinks is of the ghouls 
   eating people. What he finds on the tape instead is the retarded boy 
   reciting the famous &quot;You talkin' to me?&quot; scene from <B><A HREF="taxi_driver_1976.htm">TAXI
    DRIVER</A></B> (1976) and then knocking on a door and killing a 
   woman for no reason! The director, realizing that he has footage that 
   is headline material, says to Eric: &quot;It looks like our boat has 
   come in.&quot; Eric, chainsmoking a cigarette, just replies: 
   &quot;You're in the boat. I'm in the water.&quot; THE END. This is a 
   powerful little horror film (about 75 minutes long) which tries to 
   point out who is more evil: the people who live above ground and 
   murder, rape and deceive to get what they want (Eric leaves one of 
   the people, a corrupt cop he owes money to, unconscious on the ground 
   as bait for the ghouls, who end up ripping him in half) or the 
   &quot;monsters&quot; who live below the surface, who usually eat the 
   homeless or people who will go unnoticed to stay alive. Ferrin leaves 
   it up to you to decide who is worse. Most of the movie is filmed with 
   a hand-held camera to give it a realistic look and the lighting is 
   all natural. I watched this film with the lights out and I must say 
   that it really affected me. It probably will do the same for you. 
   Since it is such a low-budget flick, it does have some problems with 
   sound and graininess, but, man, it just adds to the atmosphere. Also 
   starring Tina Birchfield, Casey Powell, Stephen Blackehart, James 
   Gunn, Joseph Rhodes and Tiffany Shepis as the mother ghoul. A Silver

   believe that Charles Band (who directed and produced this turd) has

   and many others), he has also single-handidly destroyed what little 
   self-respect Gary Busey had left. When this film opens, serial killer 
   Millard Findlemeyer (Busey) is robbing a diner and kills everyone 
   inside, except for Sarah Leigh (Robin Sydney). Two years pass and 
   Findlemeyer has been caught and executed, thanks to Sarah's 
   testimony, who now runs her alcoholic mother's bakery. One night, 
   Sarah gets a surprise package at the door marked &quot;Grandma's 
   Gingerbread Seasoning&quot; and, without batting an eyelash or 
   questioning why she's getting a package in the middle of the night, 
   adds the seasoning to her latest batch of gingerbread dough. As we 
   all could have guessed, she shouldn't have done that. The seasoning 
   contained the cremated ashes of Findlemeyer, put there by his 
   vengeance-seeking mother (E. Dee Biddlecome). A series of

    a baker bleeding into the dough and an electrical surge into the 
   oven, create the title character, a killer gingerbread man (voiced by 
   Busey and created by John Carl Buechler) that begins killing bakery 
   customers and employees, cracking wise at every opportunity. The 
   killer cookie's real target is Sarah, who he wants to kill in 
   retribution for his execution. The rest of the film is nothing but a 
   series of badly-staged death scenes, as the Gingerdead Man cuts off 
   fingers (insert lame &quot;ladyfingers&quot; joke here), hits people 
   over the head with a frying pan (that's one strong cookie!) and even 
   drives a car (using a rolling pin to step on the gas pedal!) to 
   achieve his goal of killing Sarah. When all seems lost, baker Brick 
   Fields (Jonathan Chase) returns to the bakery and bites the head off 
   the cookie. He then becomes possessed by Findlemeyer's spirit, turns 
   into a monster (with black makeup around his eyes) and is finally 
   thrown into the oven and burned to a crisp. Thank God!&nbsp; I 
   actually had a friend tell me that I should watch this, as it was one 
   of the campiest films he can recall viewing. After watching ten 
   minutes of this, I came to this conclusion: I need to get myself some 
   new friends. This is one of the poorest, most poverty-ridden and 
   boring horror films that I have seen in quite a while. It's as if 
   Charles Band (who, nowadays, seems more interested in merchandising 
   than actual filmmaking) forgot everything he learned in over thirty 
   years in the filmmaking business and started from scratch, only this 
   time he's using the brain of a retard with an IQ of 60. Or maybe he 
   just doesn't give a crap anymore. The film plods along at such a 
   lethargic pace, that the scant 71 minute running time (ten minutes of 
   it being slow-running closing credits!) seems three times as long and 
   the script (by Silvia St. Croix and August White, who both should be 
   shot) is nothing but tired old cliches and bad puns (including some 
   of the characters' names, take-offs of food company's names). When 
   Amos Cadbury (Ryan Locke) first catches sight of the Gingerdead Man 
   and says, &quot;How much dough can you make from a talking 
   cookie?&quot;, that's about as cerebral as it gets, folks. Gary Busey 
   probably needed some quick coke money, because his face is on-screen 
   for less than three minutes and his looping of his cookie character 
   could have been done in less than an hour. Appearing in shit like 
   this is committing career suicide and if he still has the same agent, 
   he has no one but himself to blame. This is nothing but another one 
   of Band's ultra-low-budget latter-day disasters that, believe it or 
   not, spawned three sequels, <B><A HREF="gingerdead_man_2_the_passion_of_the_crust_2008.htm">GINGERDEAD

   unless they want to view Busey fall off the bottom rung of the career 
   ladder. There's no nudity, very little blood and talentless people in

   (1983) -</B> What does the suicide of a certain Dickie Cavanaugh at 
   the Weston Hill Sanitarium have to do with someone in a bear costume 
   killing the students at nearby Dewitt University? It seems Dickie 
   Cavanaugh killed the daughter of college security guard Mac (Hal 
   Holbrook) years earlier and was committed to the sanitarium after 
   being found insane. While Cavanaugh is getting a pauper's midnight 
   burial, someone dressed in black attacks and kills the two 
   gravediggers with a shovel and buries them in the grave instead, then 
   taking off with Cavanaugh's corpse. After a lengthy series of 
   exposition scenes where we are introduced to the college's many 
   students and personnel (there are almost 20 separate characters with 
   their own story arcs!), the killings begin. At a huge sorority party, 
   where students drink heavily, play strip poker, have sex and cheat on 
   each other, someone viciously stabs the student who plays the 
   basketball team's mascot and steals <A HREF="girls_night_out_1984.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/girls night out vhs small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>his
    bear costume. The killer accessorises the costume with a nasty sharp 
   homemade claw, which will be used to rip apart the female cast. The 
   killer also steals the details of the big sorority scavenger hunt, 
   which becomes useful as the killer waits at various sites to target 
   victims. The list of potential suspects (and red herrings) is large. 
   Besides Mac, who seems to harbor resentment against the student body, 
   there's Mike Pryor (David Holbrook, Hal's son), who just caught his 
   girlfriend cheating on him at the party and calls everyone 
   &quot;whores&quot; before storming out (the killer calls the female 
   victims &quot;whores&quot;, &quot;bitches&quot; or &quot;sluts&quot; 
   while killing them); Pete 'Maniac' Krizaniac (Mart McChesney), the 
   school's star basketball player who seems to be repressing a secret; 
   and Ralph (John Didricksen), the school nerd who can't score with 
   women, even when he gets them drunk. The killer calls the college 
   radio station after each kill to announce the name of the victim and 
   to proclaim, &quot;Dickie Cavanaugh is back!&quot; So who is the 
   killer and why all the killings? Is it possible that Dickie has a 
   relative on campus?&nbsp; This early 80's slasher flick is pretty 
   good for what it is, even if it does take nearly 45 minutes for the 
   first college murder to occur. What's unusual is the film's approach 
   of the women as the aggressors and the men as the followers. The 
   girls are shown smoking pot, talking graphically about sex and 
   actually being the ones talking the guys into having sex, rather than 
   vice-versa as in most other horror films. It comes as no surprise 
   then to find out that it is a female doing all the killing, too. 
   While it does take a while for the killings to start, director Robert 
   Duebel (usually a short film and documentary filmmaker) keeps the 
   film moving at a brisk pace, mixing comedy (including fart jokes), 
   personal drama and college hijinks in a pleasing stew and plays 
   plenty of 60's &amp; 70's pop hits (from such artists like The Lovin' 
   Spoonful, Ohio Express and Tommy James) on the soundtrack. The 
   murders, committed with a bear paw with serrated knives as claws, are 
   fairly bloody and the red stuff flows freely. Since the killer 
   primarily targets female victims, the first thing that popped into my 
   mind was that the killer must be male, so I was surprised when the 
   killer was unmasked. Also unusual for a slasher film is that it shows 
   two cops (one of them is the late Richard Bright) interviewing all 
   the male characters and each interview ends with the suspect saying, 
   &quot;You don't think I had anything to do with this, do you?&quot; 
   Mac ends up solving the case thanks to tapes the radio station made 
   of the calls and the film ends on a really strong image that will 
   stay in you mind for a few days. This is a damned good mystery as 
   well as a horror film and should please fans. Also known as <B><A HREF="scaremaker_1983.htm">THE

    a bloody dead cat that she just ran over like she was picking up a 
   piece of paper); her henpecked boyfriend, Ed (Hiram Bleetman); 
   virginal Jill (Rachel Mitchem) and her horny, practical joke-playing 
   boyfriend Jack (Nigel Croft-Adams); and best friend Matt (Oliver Lee 
   Squires), who has a thing for Lorrie. When they walk into the house 
   and discover that a veritable feast of food of every type is laid-out 
   on the dining room table, rather than question its presence, they 
   chow down and eat it, starting with the steak and kidney pie, but 
   when a human hair is found in it, they decide to stick with the 
   desserts instead (good thing, too, because I'm willing to bet both 
   the steak and kidney are of the human variety). It's quite obvious 
   that the masked killer also occupies the house and has a crush on 
   Lorrie (who is harboring her own secrets, as she is prone to 
   sleepwalking and puking her guts out). Could he be related to the 
   house's creepy owner, Mrs. Obadiah (Carrie Cohen), who suddenly 
   appears and begins cooking for the group in an effort to fatten them 
   up? I guess we can all see where this is heading. The killer begins 
   slaughtering the group one-by-one, beginning with Hannah and Ed (both 
   are stabbed with a pitchfork; Hannah in the stomach and Ed in the 
   back [after he steps on a bear trap!] and then both are fed through a 
   meat grinder after being cut into pieces with a chainsaw). He then 
   turns his attention towards Jack, who is tied to a table and has his 
   tongue ripped-out with a pair of pliers. Jill is next on the list, 
   leaving Matt and Lorrie to fend for themselves. When it is revealed 
   that the killer (Gary Faulkner, who is listed in the credits as 
   &quot;The Slaughterman&quot;) is actually Mrs. Obadiah's son and Matt 
   is killed (in a scene where I wanted to throw my remote at the 
   screen), Lorrie must defend herself from the killer's totally insane 
   mother. The finale, which takes place one year later, made me 
   actually throw my remote at the TV. Luckily I missed the TV and hit 
   my wife instead, so there was no damage done (Just kidding. I broke 
   my remote.).&nbsp; This highly derivative horror flick, directed by 
   freshman Gregory Mandry and written by Michael Bell and Max Waller, 
   contains all the usual horror clich&eacute;s, including being in a 
   location where there is no cellphone service; discovering a room that 
   contains all the previous victims' personal effects; finding rings 
   and other belongings in food and not questioning it; a heroine that 
   doesn't eat meat; and the worst clich&eacute; of all: Trying to hide 
   from the killer in the dark while holding a lit flashlight (Why don't 
   you just shoot-up a flare?). The killer, when unmasked, looks no more 
   scary than a soccer hooligan with a shaved head and things go from 
   bad to worse for the viewer when the asthmatic Matt, who has the 
   killer on the ground and is just about to impale him with a 
   pitchfork, decides to drop it and pick up his inhaler instead. It's 
   moments like this that makes <B><A HREF="gnaw_2008.htm">GNAW</A></B> 
   the type of experience that shakes your faith in the horror genre. I 
   almost didn't want to watch another modern horror film ever again. 
   Add to that one of the most stupefying finales in recent memory (yes, 
   it's really that bad) and what you are left with is a film so devoid 
   of characterization or plot (it is very bloody, but blood without 
   story is just blood) that I doubt anyone but diehard gorehounds (and 
   Fangoria) would have anything good to say about it. A <A HREF="http://www.darkskyfilms.com">Dark

    MET ZOMBIE CHEF FROM HELL</A><A NAME="GoreMetZombieChef"></A> (1986) -</B> 
   After watching the first few minutes of this unfunny horror comedy, I 
   was instantly reminded of how anything, no matter how threadbare and 
   poverty-stricken, could obtain a VHS release in the 80's. All you 
   needed was some attention-grabbing cover art and you were guaranteed 
   a healthy shelf life. This is exactly one of those films and, Christ, 
   it's an endurance test to sit through. In 1386, the Holy Order of the 
   Righteous Brotherhood (which seems to only have three members) 
   convicts fellow member Goza (Theo Depuay, who also handled the lousy 
   makeup effects) of high treason and make him drink a potion that 
   gives him immortality, but forces him to eat human flesh daily or 
   else his body will begin to decompose (Is it just me, or does anyone 
   else fail to see the logic behind the <A HREF="goremet_zombie_chef_from_hell_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/gore met zombie chef from hell british vhs small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Brotherhood's
    punishment? Aren't they putting countless human lives at stake for 
   the sake of one man's punishment?). Six hundred years pass and Goza 
   is now the owner of &quot;Goza's Deli and Beach Club&quot;, where he 
   kills customers (and a nosy health inspector) and, what he doesn't 
   eat himself, uses the uneaten body parts in the stew he serves his 
   clientele. The bulk of the film is Goza choosing victims and cutting 
   them up with a portable band saw (unconvincingly, mind you), while 
   the Brotherhood tries to find a way to stop him (Which, again, brings 
   up the question: Isn't this the Brotherhood's fault in the first 
   place?). The appearance of a woman named Missy (Kelley Kunicki), the 
   reincarnation of someone Goza knew six hundred years earlier, holds 
   the key to Goza's destruction. She superglues (!) Goza's mouth shut, 
   nails his feet to the floor (with a strangely convenient nailgun) and 
   watches as he decomposes. Now why didn't anyone think of that 
   before?&nbsp; Atrociuosly acted, edited, photographed and scored 
   (Porn films have better production values), this shot-on 8mm horror 
   flick, directed/produced/co-written/edited/photographed by Don Swan 
   (who, rightfully, never directed anything else), is the filmic 
   equivalent of watching paint dry. The jokes fall flat and lifeless 
   (To give you an example, when Goza kills a girl named Stella and 
   serves a burger made from her flesh to her boyfriend and he finds her 
   engagement ring in the meat, he screams out, &quot;Stella! 
   Stella!&quot; like he's in a high school version of A Streetcar Named 
   Desire. It doesn't get any better than that, folks, especially when 
   Goza advertises for a short order cook and a midget shows up to apply 
   for the job.) and the gore is nothing but dimestore props covered in 
   fake blood. I can't properly describe how mind-numbingly illogical 
   this film really is, from the robed guy carrying a staff who stands 
   outside of Goza's deli (Which isn't a deli at all. It's a 
   bar/restaurant.) and warns everyone not to go inside (Wouldn't Goza 
   just simply make him stew meat and be done with it?), to the state of 
   Goza's kitchen, which is always strewn with human body parts, Don't 
   get me started on the scene where a cop discovers the body parts, 
   sits down in a chair (with his back facing the camera) and is then 
   decapitated with one punch to the head by Goza's assistant cook! At 
   certain points in the film, Goza breaks the fourth wall and talks 
   directly into the camera, chiding the audience for judging him, 
   saying he's no worse than Joe Sixpack ordering food from McDonalds or 
   Burger King! Watching this film is akin to smelling a piece of liver 
   sitting in the blazing sun for three days. If the film itself doesn't 
   question your film-watching habits, the droning electronic music 
   score (coupled with a bad 50's-styled ditty, sung by a local black 
   guy accompanied by a saxophone player) which drowns out much of the 
   dialogue, will surely make you believe that you have a brain tumor. 
   Really, what other explanation could it be? Also starring C.W. Casey,

   slasher film helped by a veteran cast of genre actors. Tragedy 
   strikes at a high school track meet when sprinter Laura Ramstead 
   (Ruth Ann Llorens) drops dead after winning the hundred-yard dash 
   (turns out she had a bad ticker). It's not long before both male and 
   female members of the track team are dispatched in various gory 
   manners. Laura's sister, Anne (Patch Mackenzie; <B><A HREF="#DarkTower1987">THE

   and arrives in town just as a female student is killed while jogging

   Graduation Day is rapidly approaching and some of the athletes blame 
   Coach George Michaels (Christopher George; <B><A HREF="grizzly_1976.htm">GRIZZLY</A></B> 
   - 1976) for Laura's death because he's a no-nonsense kind of guy who

    only plans to stay until graduation is over (a special trophy in 
   Laura's honor is to be given to Anne) and she has no desire to keeps 
   Laura's life insurance payout, which pleases a drunken Ronald. The 
   black-gloved killer begins crossing out the faces of his victims on a 
   team photo in red lipstick, while Anne tries to figure out why Laura 
   really died; beginning with Laura's boyfriend, Kevin Badger (E. Danny 
   Murphy; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#FinalMission1984">FINAL MISSION</A></B> 
   - 1984), who keeps a shrine of Laura in his home (as well as a crazy

   necklace she was going to give her sister at graduation. Coach 
   Michaels forces gymnast Sally (Denise Cheshire) to do her entire 
   uneven bar routine just for a newspaper photo op and the killer 
   (again with stopwatch in hand) murders her by thrusting a sword 
   through her neck while she is shaving her legs in the shower. Music 
   teacher Mr. Roberts (Richard Balin) is seduced by topless student 
   Dolores (a baby-faced Linnea Quigley) and Principal Guglione (Michael 
   Pataki; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Grave Vampire">GRAVE OF THE VAMPIRE</A></B> 
   - 1972), who carries a switcblade (red herring alert!), is having an 
   affair with his secretary Blondie (E.J. Peaker), so it's no wonder 
   that no one notices that students are going missing. Mr. Roberts 
   hears a tapping on the pipes and checks out the boiler room (Hasn't 
   he ever watched a horror film?), where someone is playing a cassette 
   tape of his makeout session with Dolores (It's a practical joke by 
   Dolores and Tony [Billy Hufsy] and the entire sequence leads 
   nowhere). Dolores and Tony get caught smoking pot by Officer 
   MacGregor (Virgil Frye; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#UpFromTheDepths">UP
    FROM THE DEPTHS</A></B> - 1979), but he lets them off with a warning 
   and tokes-up on the joint he confiscated from them. Anne accuses 
   Coach Michaels of killing her sister, but he tells Anne he 
   &quot;loved&quot; Laura, just like all his students (He also lost his 
   coaching job after graduation is over). The stopwatch killer then 
   dispatches football player Pete (Tom Hintnaus) with a spike-tipped 
   football to his midsection. Think you know who the killer is? I've

   and gore. Sure, there are plenty of deaths and some practical makeup 
   effects, but they lack the &quot;oomph&quot; needed to make them 
   memorable. Tony suffers from one of the driest decapitations this 
   side of an Andy Milligan film and Herb Freed hopes the editing, which 
   is full of shock cuts and pre-MTV flash editing (some of it almost 
   subliminal), will keep our minds occupied. It doesn't. The closest 
   thing this film comes to actual gore is when a pole vaulter lands on 
   a bunch of spikes and Anne discovering the dead bodies (and body 
   parts) under the bleachers while being chased by the killer. This is 
   the type of horror film where every major character acts like they 
   could be the killer by doing or saying ominous things (Such as Anne 
   saying to Coach Michaels, &quot;We'll meet again!&quot; Of course 
   they'll meet again. They'll both be at the graduation ceremony!). 
   It's no wonder that Herb Freed gave up filmmaking to become a rabbi!

   her with Satan's seed. He is caught before he is able to finish the 
   deed and is tortured on the rack. When he refuses to repent his sins,

    (Maria Rebeca) join their other two grave robbing friends down the

   and open it, even after Rebecca (who is psychic) begs them not to

   profanation!&quot;). They find the body of the Noble Executioner and 
   remove the jewel-encrusted axe from his chest. As soon as the axe is 
   removed, a storm brews outside and the bloodshed begins. The four 
   graverobbers hop in their truck to leave, but it's hopelessly stuck 
   in the mud (not much of a surprise there). The revived Executioner 
   grabs his axe out of the back of the truck and goes on a killing 
   spree, first killing two peasants on horseback who try to help the 
   foursome free the truck from the mud. Police Captain Lopez (Fernando 
   Almada) happens to be driving by and sees a riderless horse dart by 
   him. Once he sees the two slaughtered bodies of the peasants, he 
   arrests the four graverobbers for murder. At first he doesn't believe 
   the story they have to tell, but when more bodies turn up brutally 
   murdered, he has no choice. Captain Lopez has another reason to 
   worry: His virginal daughter Olivia (Edna Bolkan) is camping out in 
   the woods with three other female friends and she is the perfect 
   candidate to bear Satan's son. Captain Lopez finds a book bearing the 
   coat of arms of the Holy Inquisition that will put an end to this 
   menace, but it is written in Latin. He goes to his local church to 
   enlist the help of the Padre (Roberto Canedo) in hopes of unlocking 
   the books secrets. As two of the graverobbers meet a bloody end, 
   Captain Lopez must find a way to stop his daughter from becoming

   but it's apparent that they're a labor of love and a breath of fresh 
   air when compared to the sterile CGI effects of today. The film has a 
   low-budget atmosphere that's infectious, so it's various shortcomings

   (1999) bears no resemblance to the first two films (which includes 
   2002's <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BloodyMurder2">BLOODY MURDER 2</A></B>,
    the best in the series) and if it didn't take place in Camp Placid 
   Pines (and Placid Pines Cemetery), it would have nothing in common 
   with them. Which brings up the question: Would you send your kids to 
   a summer camp if you knew it came with it's own namesake cemetery 
   right next door? The film opens with six friends going to the 
   cemetery one night and playing a practical joke on Eric (Mark 
   Salling), where Bobby (Patrick Scott Lewis) dons a rubber fright mask 
   and track suit and chases Eric around the graveyard with a butcher 
   knife. Unfortunately, Eric takes it a little too seriously and 
   impales himself on a wrought iron fence while running away and dies. 
   Bobby is sent away to prison on a manslaughter charge and, when he is 
   paroled five years later, he and the four remaining friends (along 
   with some guests) return to the graveyard for a weekend (they stay in 
   Camp Placid Pines' cabins) to work out their issues. While Bobby acts 
   all mysterious and morose, someone wearing the same costume Bobby 
   wore that fateful night five years earlier begins killing the members one-by-<A HREF="graveyard_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/graveyard 2006 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="155" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>one.
    Bobby's ex-girlfriend Michelle (Lindsay Ballen) tries to get 
   everyone to share in Bobby's guilt, but some members, including 
   skirt-chasing Jack (Leif Lillehaugen), look on this excursion as a 
   vacation. When Michelle and Sarah (Erin Michelle Lokitz) go to pay 
   their respects at Eric grave (Lucky for them he was buried in the 
   same cemetery where he died!), they find the grave has been recently 
   dug up and Eric's body is missing. Jack's new girlfriend Veronica 
   (Eva Derrek) is strangled by the killer when she's taking a shower 
   and while cook/caretaker Peter Bishop (Markus Potter) leads a search 
   for her through the woods, Sarah's lesbian ex-girlfriend Zoe (Natalie 
   Denise Sperl) shows up and threatens everyone's lives (Never mess 
   with an angry lesbian!), but she dies shortly after when the killer 
   slits her throat (thereby eliminating her as a suspect). After Bobby 
   and Jack play the worst (not to mention unbelievable) practical joke 
   possible, the group finds all their cars disabled, the tires slashed 
   and wires cut. Bobby leaves by himself to make the ten mile trek to 
   the next town, while the masked killer begins slaughtering everyone 
   else in earnest. As bodies begin to pile up, Bobby is arrested by the 
   sheriif he flags down, while the remainder of the group try to figure 
   out who the killer is. You'll have to be stupider than a tree stump 
   not to figure it out yourself.&nbsp; The best way to describe this 
   film is &quot;yawn&quot;. It's not badly made or amateurishly acted 
   (except for a couple of people), but the film offers nothing remotely 
   interesting to horror fans. Like most DTV flicks, the script (by 
   Michael Hurst, who directed the much better than expected <B><A HREF="house_of_the_dead_2_2005.htm">HOUSE

   [2005], as well as <B><A HREF="pumpkinhead_4_blood_feud_2007.htm">PUMPKINHEAD

   sense. When Bobby and Jack pull their practical joke in the latter 
   half of the film, that's the straw that breaks the camel's back, 
   because it's so unrealistic, it's laughable. Director Michael Feifer (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#EdGeinButcherPlainf">ED
    GEIN: THE BUTCHER OF PLAINFIELD</A></B> - 2007) is downright sloppy 
   in a lot of scenes (Eric impalement is pathetic) and has the habit of 
   pulling back when he should be pushing forward. There's an offscreen 
   decapitation, a really bad throat slashing (you can see the blood 
   coming from the blade of the knife), a bloodless strangulation, an 
   electrocution (in the film's second unrealistic plot twist), a 
   hatchet to the chest and other killings, none of them remotely 
   interesting. There's also some nice female nudity (all courtesy of 
   Eva Derrek), but it's not nearly enough to get your mind off on how 
   ordinary the whole film is. The reveal of the killer's identity is 
   telegraphed from the time of the reunion and the actor who plays the 
   sheriff (Sam Bologna) is horrendous and keeps saying, &quot;I haven't 
   fired my gun since 1974!&quot;. If you're expecting something special 
   to happen when he finally does fire his gun, forget it. This film's 
   not that inventive. The &quot;surprise&quot; stinger ending leaves it 
   wide-open for another sequel. After enjoying <B>BLOODY MURDER 2</B> 
   so much, I was expecting something much more entertaining than this.

   developer Joshua (Mel Ferrer) has created a tourist trap called 
   Paradise House in some tropical jungle and has invited photographer 
   Daniel Nessel (Claudio Cassinelli) and model Sheena (Geneve Hutton) 
   to come and view the new attraction a few days before it officially 
   opens (When Joshua mentions to Sheena that Eve may have been a black 
   woman, the black Sheena replies, &quot;All I know is that Adam was a 
   stupid shit!&quot;). Joshua assigns his personal assistant, Alice 
   (Barbara Bach), to show Daniel around, but when Daniel views members 
   of the local Kuma tribe being used as menial and dangerous labor for 
   Joshua's new resort, he becomes concerned that Joshua is taking 
   advantage of them. Daniel also becomes worried when he spots Joshua's 
   right-hand man, Peter (Romano Puppo), feeding live pigs to the 
   crocodile population, in order to keep them close to Paradise House 
   as a tourist attraction. Sheena is eaten by a giant alligator while 
   making love to a Kuma tribesman on the eve before the resort's grand 
   opening and, as a busload of tourists arrive to stay at the resort, 
   Daniel finds Sheena's canoe with huge bite marks in it and fears she 
   is dead. When Daniel relays his fears <A HREF="great_alligator_1979.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/great alligator vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>to
    Joshua about a man-eating alligator on the loose, Joshua prefers 
   that Daniel keeps quiet as not to disturb the resort's full house. 
   Daniel and Alice travel down river to the Kuma tribal village, where 
   they review a ritual being performed by the tribe and they're getting 
   pissed off. They are told by a tribe member that the &quot;Great 
   God&quot; (the giant alligator) has been disturbed by the 
   deforestation and blasting done to create Paradise House and are led 
   to the secret hiding place (in a cave behind a waterfall) of crazy 
   Father Jonathan (Richard Johnson), a missionary who fought the giant 
   alligator years earlier and was the only member from his mission who 
   survived. What a giant alligator is doing living with the crocodile 
   population is never explained, but when Daniel and Alice barely make 
   it back to the resort after being attacked by the alligator and 
   report it to Joshua, he has Peter beat Daniel up when he tries to 
   call for help on the radio. That night, the resort's helicopter is 
   mysteriously dragged into the lagoon and someone destroys the radio's 
   antennae just as the alligator begins to chow-down on the tourists 
   and resort staff. When Joshua refuses to cancel the tourist boat ride 
   down the river (called &quot;Tarzan's Raft&quot;!) and the Kuma tribe 
   kidnaps Alice and plan to use her as their next sacrifice to appease 
   the Great God, Daniel has to spring into action to try to save Alice 
   and the boatload of tourists. He manages to save Alice, but when it 
   comes to the tourists, let's just say the natives are as restless as

   &quot;George Eastman&quot;), holds most of the gore to a minimum 
   until the finale, which shows the tourists fighting for their lives 
   from two sources: The deadly alligator in the water and the Kuma 
   tribe, who have had enough debasement and begin killing the tourists 
   with flaming spears and arrows as soon as they make it to shore. It's 
   the film's best sequence, as the tourists must decide which is the 
   worst death; in the jaws of an alligator or a flaming sharp stick in 
   the gut. Some of the tourists, in their panic, end up impaling 
   themselves on the crocodile fence that surrounds the lagoon. 
   Unfortunately, the rest of the film is fairly routine and bloodless. 
   There's also an annoying subplot where a little girl tourist named 
   Minou (Silvia Collatina) wanders around the resort saying 
   &quot;adorable&quot; things, while her mother and new boyfriend avoid 
   her. Two minutes after listening to her drivel, I was wishing the 
   alligator would make her a snack. Speaking of the alligator, it's 
   kept mainly off-screen or at least clouded by the water, which is a 
   good thing considering what is viewable is not very believable. The 
   scene where the van that Daniel and Alice are in plunges into the 
   lagoon is obviously (bad) model work. The Sri Lanka locations are 
   pretty to look at, though. Also starring Fabrizia Castagnoli, Enzo

   hours at the Xcaliber Bowling Center, which results in Lisa (Candice 
   Lewald) getting gang-raped and violated with a bowling pin (in a 
   needlessly graphic and overlong scene) by four miscreants, one of

   stalked by an unseen killer, who wears a modified bowling bag over 
   his head and uses various bowling-related items to dispatch the cast. 
   Steve and his team are surprised to see Lisa at the tournament, 
   especially since it looks as if she has told no one about the 
   gang-rape the night before. Lisa corners the weakest member of

   electronic scoreboard using the initials BBK, strikes first when he 
   suffocates opposing team member Dave (Scott Alonzo) and bimbo Julia 
   (Danielle Munro) as they are performing oral sex on each other (Julia 
   chokes to death on Dave's cock and Dave is asphyxiated on Julia's 
   pussy in graphic close-up). BBK then kills transvestite AJ (Nathan 
   Dashwood) by shoving a bowling pin down his throat and then slicing 
   his penis in half (again in graphic close-up) like a piece of 
   sausage. As BBK continues his killing spree, stabbing one guy 
   repeatedly in the head with a sharpened bowling pin, crushing a 
   girl's head between two bowling balls, strangling another girl with 
   the laces of a pair of bowling shoes, grinding a guy's face to a pulp

   bowling pin and sending his dismembered head up the ball return, the 
   final two bowlers, Jamie and Sarah (Mihola Terzic), try to escape the 
   bowling alley, only to find every exit blocked. The final reveal of 
   the killer(s) is one of the most incoherent and unbelievable endings 
   in modern slasher film history. This X-rated gore flick, 
   directed/written by Ryan Nicholson (<B><A HREF="torched_2004.htm">TORCHED</A></B> 
   - 2004; <B><A HREF="films_on_the_fringe.htm#LiveFeed">LIVE FEED</A></B> 
   - 2006), is a foul-mouthed, sex-filled horror film that tries to be a 
   throwback to the gore-drenched slasher flicks of the 80's (including 
   a lot of songs from the 70's &amp; 80's on the soundtrack), but the 
   amateur acting and general cheapness of the production proves to be 
   it's undoing. While the gore effects are very well done (some are 
   absolutely hard to watch, especially the penis slicing) and the 
   inclusion of hardcore sex scenes an added bonus (although it's 
   unlikely most viewers will ever see these scenes when this film gets 
   a distribution deal), the absence of any likable characters (they are 
   either sex-crazed perverts [including the women] or curse word-filled 
   cretins) makes it hard for the audience to give a damn about anyone's 
   fate. If it's gore you want, this film delivers. If it's a coherent 
   plot and interesting characters you crave, you're better off sticking 
   with the actual slasher films of the 80's, where a semblance of plot 
   and character development were more paramount. BBK is a ridiculous 
   looking serial killer, wearing a bowling bag over his head and 
   donning two bowling pins in holsters like they were six-shooters. The 
   unmasking (or rather, unbagging) of BBK and the explanation of what 
   the initials stand for is laughable to the point of being insanely 
   stupid. Let's just say that <B><A HREF="gutterballs_2008b.htm">GUTTERBALLS</A></B> 
   is bloody as hell but it doesn't have a brain cell in its tiny little 
   head. I also have the feeling that the music soundtrack, which 
   contains songs by Loverboy, Bachman Turner Overdrive, April Wine and 
   Trooper, will probably be altered before it is legally distributed. I 
   seriously doubt an ultra-low-budget film like this could afford the 
   licensing fees for these songs. BBK would return in the equally

   person with his equally-talented wife Megan. The sequel was funded by 
   a Kickstarter campaign and they reached their goal in less than a 
   day, which says a lot about the popularity of the first film. I don't

   (one of the film's alternate titles). Grandpa's influence has left 
   its mark on Tommy. He likes the taste of blood, dresses in black 
   clothing, likes his room stuffy and keeps a satanic altar in his 
   bedroom closet. This worries Mom quite a bit as well as Tommy's 
   sister (Carla Baron) and policeman brother (Jeff Brown). To make 
   matters worse, someone wearing a Devil costume is slaughtering the 
   town's population in various ways. When his sister's boyfriend turns 
   up dead (a shovel buried in his head), she blames Tommy and crashes 
   his inauguration with the Devil to exact revenge. She is captured and 
   Grandpa orders Tommy to kill her. He frees her instead which greatly 
   disappoints Grandpa. The climatic showdown at the town's annual 
   Halloween party pits Grandpa against the masked killer. Grandpa dies 
   (but not before passing his powers on to one of his grandkids) and 
   the killer is unmasked (no real surprise). This is an OK horror item

   nudity to hold your interest. A beheading, a hoe to the side of the

   (2007) -</B> This regional horror film, lensed in Austin, Texas, 
   opens with someone murdering all the school children (by hanging, 
   stabbing, bashing in the head with a rock) in a one-room schoolhouse 
   in 1901 Texas and then burying the young bodies somewhere in the 
   forest. Cut to the present, as we watch Tyler Jensen (Derek Lee 
   Nixon) attending the funeral of his grandmother Hanna Myers. He has a 
   flashback to when he was a child and Grandma Hanna grabbed his hand 
   and cryptically said, &quot;It stops with you!&quot;. Tyler has been 
   away at college and when he returns back to the town of 
   Hallettsville, it opens a floodgate of memories and bad emotions, the 
   toughest being the breakup with his girlfriend April (Katie 
   Fountain). She is till trying to get back together with Tyler (even 
   offering to move so she can go to college with him), but she hurt him 
   so bad, he wants nothing to do with her. When Tyler finds out that 
   his parents are about to sell Grandma Hanna's ranch house, he gathers 
   his friends, Luke (producer Logan Patrick Brown), Mark (Jordan 
   Brower), Jonathan (Jesse Janzen), Candice (Brooke<A HREF="hallettsville_2007.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hallettsville poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Baker) and Kristin (Karoly Giardello), to come with him to spend one 
   more weekend at the house. Even April is able to talk her way into 
   coming with them. On their way to the ranch house, they are stopped 
   by Sheriff Dave Ketchum (a slurred-speech Gary Busey), who warns them 
   not to cause any trouble while they are here. Tyler's mother (GiGi 
   Erneta) is not very keen on Tyler and his friends going to Grandma 
   Hanna's house because, when she was a little girl, she found the 
   dead, mutilated body of her brother and later saw a horned demon in 
   her bedroom, but she closed her eyes real tight and it went away. 
   That night, around a campfire on the ranch house property (Where 
   Jonathan tells this joke: <B>Q:</B> &quot;What's funnier than a dead 
   baby?&quot; <B>A.</B> &quot;A dead baby in a clown suit!&quot;), 
   Tyler tells everyone that on this property in 1901, a black-clad, 
   mustached stranger visited school teacher Adam Lemmerich (Aidan 
   Marus) in the middle of the night and possessed him. The next morning 
   he killed all the school children in his charge, buried them and then 
   disappeared, never to be seen again. Before you can say, &quot;Hey, 
   is this ranch house haunted?&quot;, the house begins fucking with 
   everyones' heads, so much so that Jonathan wants to go home. Tyler 
   agrees to drive him home, but when April tells Tyler that she's 
   pregnant, Jonathan's problem suddenly takes a back seat. Too bad, 
   because Jonathan is being haunted by the ghosts of all the dead 
   school children. He steals Tyler's truck, flips it over trying to 
   avoid a coyote in the middle of the road and is killed by one of the 
   ghosts, leaving everyone else trapped at the haunted ranch house with 
   no way out (Hey, don't they have feet? And conveniently, cell phones 
   don't work there.). Mark is the next to die (drowned in a pond), 
   followed by Kristin (tied to a tree and butchered), leaving the 
   remaining foursome to grab some weapons to fight the ghost children 
   (What do you use to kill ghosts? They're already dead!). But is it 
   only the children they should worry about?&nbsp; This totally 
   ordinary low-budget horror flick, directed and co-written (with star 
   Derek Lee Nixon and Tim Massey) by freshman Andrew Pozza, offers no 
   real surprises to the viewers. The story has enough holes to drive a 
   train through (The convenient discovery of Adam's journal, which 
   explains everything. Where has it been for over a hundred years?) and 
   the gore is very restrained, consisting of quick, almost subliminal, 
   edits or showing the after-effects of the kills. Gary Busey (who 
   looks very gaunt here, but no less crazy than usual) seems to be 
   embarrassed to be involved in this film (which may be why they gave 
   him a Producer credit) and is given the lion's share of awful 
   dialogue (Tyler: &quot;Can we have a minute here?&quot; Sheriff: 
   &quot;You have 59 seconds.&quot; What is this, <B><A HREF="lets_make_a_deal_tv_series_1963-1977.htm">LET'S
    MAKE A DEAL</A></B>?). The majority of the film finds the cast 
   walking or running through the woods, while ghost children and 
   grunting demons pick them off one-by-one. <B><A HREF="hallettsville_2007b.htm">HALLETTSVILLE</A></B> 
   has as much meat on its bones as a starving Somalian child. The 
   downbeat finale, which we have seen a thousand times in modern DTV 
   horror flicks (Busey quits the police force and gets drunk [there's a 
   stretch!] and April has her baby, who has pitch-black eyes), only add 
   to its ordinariness. It's not a badly-made film, just a forgettable 
   one. Also starring Dorian Ingram, Andrew Rice and Zach Freeman. A

    is expecting a marriage proposal. The trouble is, Chris has just 
   killed party guest Todd (Nicholas Daly Clark) when he stops at a gas 
   station bathroom to change into his costume (a masked medieval knight 
   complete with an armory of real edged weapons, in one of the film's 
   most offensive coincidences). Chris dons Todd's costume and, after 
   killing Todd (a sword through the mouth) and his girlfriend (repeated 
   blows to the stomach with a miniature battleaxe until her guts spill 
   out), he heads to David's party. David punks all his friends with an 
   ultimately tasteless practical joke that involves friend Daryll 
   (Jared Michaels; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Plaguers2008">PLAGUERS</A></B> 
   - 2008), a fake cop and Todd as a hostage, but since Todd isn't 
   actually Todd, the joke does not play out as planned and real cops 
   show up and shut the party down. &quot;Hostage&quot; Chris (still 
   dressed as Todd) impales Daryll with a sword and kills the fake cop 
   (away from everyone else) and heads back to the house, where a 
   pissed-off Shannon (who wasn't in on the prank), David and a few 
   friends (including a couple of horny lesbians) still remain. Chris 
   begins dispatching the few remaining guests with his arsenal of sharp 
   weapons (he favors the battleaxe), but he doesn't harm Shannon 
   because she reminds him of his mother, including the necklace she 
   wears around her neck that David just gave her. The questions soon 
   become: Is it the same exact necklace and where did David get it 
   from? While Chris keeps Shannon tied-up in one of the bedrooms, the 
   killings continue and secrets are revealed (Such as: This is the same 
   house where Chris was disfigured and his mother was raped and killed 
   ten years earlier.). I think we can all see where this is heading; 
   right up to the ready-made finale that leaves this film wide-open for 
   a sequel.&nbsp; Purportedly based on a true story (yeah, right), <B>HALLOWEEN
    NIGHT</B> is nothing but a series of gory stalk 'n' slash scenes 
   with a minimum of plot. Director Mark Atkins (<B><A HREF="evil_eyes_2004.htm">EVIL

   Gingold (<B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Leeches">LEECHES!</A></B> 
   - 2003) have fashioned a horror film that exists solely on 
   clich&eacute;s, coincidences and stereotypes (The only person who 
   puts up much of a fight with Chris is one of the lesbians and she 
   gets a wooden clothes hanger shoved through her eye at the end of the 
   fight). The major problem with this film, though, is the performance 
   by Derek Osedach as David. He delivers all his lines (even the most 
   serious ones) in such a glib, almost unrehearsed, manner that he 
   comes across as a younger, less funny, version of Adam Carolla (if 
   you can imagine that). While there is plenty of blood and gore on 
   view, none of it is particularly well done or memorable. It's usually 
   quickly-edited shots of someone being impaled or sliced, followed by 
   shots of the victims spitting-up blood. In other words, another 
   typical flick from the The Asylum, who have never been accused of 
   trying too hard. Also starring Sean Durrie, Alicia Klein, Erica Roby,

    19th Century Scotland: We watch a funeral procession for a Count, 
   which concludes at his creepy tomb. The priest performing the service 
   gets so creeped out, he rushes through the service and runs out of 
   the tomb. Then we see the daughter of the Count, Mary (Aurora de Alba;<A HREF="hanging_woman_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hanging woman poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="196" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> <B><A HREF="vengeance_of_the_zombies_1972.htm">VENGEANCE
    OF THE ZOMBIES</A></B> - 1972), sneaking into the empty tomb and 
   searching her father's corpse. She finds a document, but before she 
   is able to read it, someone or something grabs her (whatever it is, 
   it is impervious to her derringer). Mary is found hanging by her neck 
   in the cemetery by Serge Chekov (&quot;Stan Cooper&quot;; real name: 
   Stelvio Rosi; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#SomethingCreeping71">SOMETHING 
   CREEPING IN THE DARK</A></B> - 1971), the Count's nephew, who 
   traveled a long distance to be at his funeral (and the reading of his 
   will). He starts banging on doors, but no one will answer, until he 
   gets to the castle of Countess Nadia Mihaly (Maria Pia Conte; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Spasmo">SPASMO</A></B> 
   - 1974). He notices a painting hanging on the wall that looks exactly 
   like Mary and when he tells the Countess that he found her hanging in 
   the cemetery, she yells out , &quot;She is my step-daughter!&quot; 
   and then faints. The police are called in (but not before we witness 
   Mary's gory autopsy, as we see her chest cut open and her internal 
   organs are removed), where the Inspector (Pasquale Basile) announces 
   to everyone in the castle that Mary was murdered and it was made to 
   look like a suicide. Since Mary was to inherit her father's fortune, 
   the next in the family line to reap the dead Count's fortunes will 
   be... Serge Chekov.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This news doesn't sit too well with the Countess, so she comes up 
   with a plan to get rid of Serge with the help of her sometimes lover, 
   cemetery caretaker Igor (Paul Naschy; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#PeopleOwnDark1975">THE
    PEOPLE WHO OWN THE DARK</A></B> - 1975). The major problem with this 
   plan is that the Inspector believes Igor killed Mary, so he will have 
   to stay hidden until the heat blows over. The Countess offers Serge a 
   room in the castle, but the butler (Charles Quiney) has objections 
   (he may also be the Countess' lover!) and they get into a fight, 
   Serge winning and chasing the butler out of the house by shooting his 
   pistol at his feet. Igor tries to kill Serge that night, but fails, 
   so the Countess plays stupid and invites Serge into her bedroom. She 
   asks Serge if he believes in the occult and then they both strip and 
   make love (this is intercut with Igor opening Mary's casket and 
   fondling her autopsied body. Necrophelia is implied!). Serge then 
   meets his Uncle's partner, Professor Leon Droila (G&eacute;rard 
   Tichy; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Pieces">PIECES</A></B> - 1982), a 
   scientist who has a laboratory in the castle. The Professor is 
   nervous that Serge will sell the castle, thereby discontinuing his 
   experiments on reanimating dead tissue. Serge tells him that he can 
   continue his experiments because he has no plans on selling the 
   castle. This being a castle, there are all sorts of secret 
   passageways and peep holes that the Countess and Igor can use to spy 
   on Serge.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Professor's daughter, Doris (Dianick Zorakowska; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#VampiresNightOrgy72">THE
    VAMPIRES NIGHT ORGY</A></B> - 1972) and Serge begin a tentative love 
   affair because she does not want Serge to sell the castle, so her 
   father can continue his experiments (The first time they meet, Serge 
   makes her strip in front of him. If she doesn't her father is out of 
   a job. When Doris does strip, Serge calls her &quot;the most stupid 
   girl I have ever known&quot; because he already agreed to let her 
   father continue his experiments. Yet she still falls in love with 
   him!). By a fluke of luck, Serge finds the Count's secret hidden 
   diary, but it is written in Russian. He has Doris translate the last 
   entry in the diary. It says, &quot;I will take my secret to the 
   tomb&quot;. Serge believes that the Count has a document on his dead 
   body that could explain his death and who killed him, so he plans, 
   with Doris' help, to break into the tomb and retrieve the document. 
   With Doris playing decoy for the Inspector, he breaks into the tomb, 
   but the Count's body is not there. The Countess proposes that they 
   perform a seance to contact Mary, so she can tell them what was in 
   the document (Why not contact the Count? He would know better than 
   Mary!). Alas, the seance comes off better than expected, as a 
   zombified Count appears in the room and strangles the life out of the 
   Countess. For some unknown reason, Serge believes Igor is to blame 
   and runs to the tomb. Serge is knocked out and the zombie Count kills 
   Igor, sealing his body in an empty chamber in the tomb. When Serge 
   comes to, the Inspector is expecting answers. The Count's body is now 
   in the tomb and the Inspector discovers Igor's dead body in the tomb 
   chamber, where he has written &quot;No37&quot; in his own blood on 
   the chamber wall. What could it possibly mean?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Inspector puts Serge under house arrest, mistakenly thinking he 
   killed Igor, but he and Doris are determined to discover the truth. 
   Are the dead coming back to life? Are the Professor's reanimation 
   experiments successful? Who is the woman Serge sees wearing Doris' 
   cape? Has the Countess come back to life? (To make sure Igor is 
   really dead, Serge stabs his corpse in the heart with a knife!). It 
   is at this point that the film switches from a mystery to a 
   straight-up horror film, as Serge and Doris are attacked by the 
   reanimated corpses of the Countess and the butler. The Inspector 
   captures Serge, but Doris is trapped in the castle's catacombs, a 
   series of tunnels <A HREF="return_of_the_zombis_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/return of the zombies poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>that
    run beneath the castle into the cemetery. Serge is able to figure 
   out that when &quot;No37&quot; is read upside-down, it reads 
   &quot;LEoN&quot; or &quot;Leon&quot;, the Professor's first name. The 
   Professor reanimates Igor (He still has the knife sticking out of his 
   chest!) and explains his dastardly plans to Serge. It seems that the 
   Count went mad and wanted the Professor to supply him with an army of 
   zombies (WTF?!?), and he wanted nothing to do with it, but he didn't 
   want to lose his laboratory, so he killed the Count (and had one of 
   his zombies kill Mary). He used the castle's underground tunnels to 
   steal bodies from the cemetery for his experiments. The Professor 
   doesn't know that his daughter is trapped in the catacombs and when 
   he realizes he has no control over Igor (Serge has to cut Igor's head 
   off with a sword!), he and Serge try to rescue Doris from his other 
   zombies. How do you kill a zombie in 19th Century Scotland (Serge 
   tries by pumping nine bullets into the butler's body with his 
   six-shooter, without reloading!)? Fire is a good idea, but expect a 
   surprise ending.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    I think I know know what that &quot;missing something&quot; thing is 
   that I mentioned at the top of this review. This film is far too 
   schizophrenic for its own good. It doesn't know whether it wants to 
   be a mystery or a horror film and it fails at both. Too bad, because 
   the horror in this film is palpable, but it is under-utilized. The 
   zombies are frightening in their appearance, but we see too little of 
   them. Director/co-screenwriter (with Enrico Colombo; <B><A HREF="night_of_the_blood_monster_1970.htm">NIGHT

   care what happens to Serge or Doris since they are so broadly written 
   (Serge especially, since he treats Doris like a two dollar whore and 
   she gladly accepts it). Paul Naschy took a secondary role in this

    THE 13TH</A></B> (1980), they quickly commissioned their own slasher

    FORBIDDEN SUBJECTS</A></B> - 1989). The choice of casting Western 
   film and TV star Glenn Ford to offset the young cast was also an odd 
   choice, in what amounts to an extended cameo (although he does have 
   more screen time here than he did in the strange Italian/German 
   horror film <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Visitor1978">THE VISITOR</A></B> 
   - 1978), but this whole film has this same odd feel, like its whole 
   purpose was to rush it out to theaters before the slasher craze ran 
   its course. The story is fairly simple: Troubled teen Virginia 
   &quot;Ginny&quot; Wainwright (Melissa Sue Anderson; <B><A HREF="midnight_offerings_1981.htm">MIDNIGHT
    OFFERINGS</A></B> - 1981) re-enrolls as a student at Crawford

    of her new clique of friends begin dying bloody deaths. Previously, 
   Ginny was involved in a car accident where her mother died and Ginny 
   laid in a coma for several months, but an experimental procedure to 
   regrow brain tissue was performed on her, which made Ginny wake up. 
   Her memory is a bit foggy, but as every day passes, she gets bits and 
   pieces of it back with the help of her psychiatrist, Dr. David 
   Faraday (Ford). Harold (Lawrence Dane; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Rituals">RITUALS</A></B> 
   - 1977), Ginny's very rich father, seems to be holding something back 
   from his daughter, but when more and more of Ginny's friends end up 
   missing (they are actually killed, but only the audience is let in on 
   that), even his money may not buy his way out of this situation. We 
   watch as Ginny's friends meet various bloody demises by a killer 
   dressed in black leather (including the prerequisite gloves): 
   Bernadette (Lesleh Donaldson; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Funeral Home">FUNERAL
    HOME</A></B> - 1981) has her throat slit with a strait razor; 
   Etienne (Michel Rene Labelle) has his face turned into a bloody pulp 
   when his scarf is tossed into the spinning wheels of his motorcycle; 
   Greg (Richard Rebiere) has his trachea crushed when the killer drops 
   a 20 lb. weight on his balls while he is bench-pressing way too much 
   weight; Alfred (Jack Blum) is stabbed in the stomach with garden 
   shears; Steve (Matt Craven; <B><A HREF="intruder_within_1981.htm">THE 
   INTRUDER WITHIN</A></B> - 1981) is skewered through the mouth with a 
   shish-kebab tong; Ann (Tracy Bregman; <B><A HREF="concrete_jungle_1982.htm">THE
    CONCRETE JUNGLE</A></B> - 1982) has her throat cut and is placed in 
   a bathtub; and Dr. Faraday has his skull split open with a fireplace 
   poker. All evidence points to Ginny being the killer and as her 
   eighteenth birthday rapidly approaches, it sets the all-too-familiar 
   scene of all the dead students sitting around Ginny's birthday table, 
   complete with birthday hats and party favors, but an unbelievable 
   final coda reveals if Ginny is really the killer or not (bet on 
   not).&nbsp; Way too overlong at 111 minutes, <B><A HREF="happy_birthday_to_me_1980b.htm">HAPPY
    BIRTHDAY TO ME</A></B> suffers from that old corporate curse: Yeah, 
   we want to make a teen slasher flick, but let's fill it with 
   characters that were born to be red herrings (not to mention that 
   they don't act like teens I ever knew), adults that act like they 
   were never kids (they either yell at, ignore or patronize the teens) 
   and edit the killings so that they show a hint of red, but never goes 
   &quot;all the way&quot; (You have to hit the freeze frame button on 
   your remote to get the full effect). Another important aspect this 
   film lacks is nudity, something teen slashers must have. The closest 
   it gets is showing Ms. Anderson in her bra. She even takes a shower 
   and we see nothing! So basically what we have here is what a big 
   studio thinks a slasher film should be and, of course, they miss the 
   whole point by a mile. The late Glenn Ford looks and acts bored 
   beyond tears and the screenplay, by John Saxton, Peter Jobin and 
   Timothy Bond, is full of those handy coincidences and surprise 
   reveals that makes audiences groan loudly in disbelief (especially 
   that perfect Melissa Sue Anderson mask that the killer wears in the 
   finale that would make <B><A HREF="mission_impossible_tv_series.htm">MISSION
    IMPOSSIBLE</A></B> envious!). Worth viewing if only to see how big 
   corporations fuck-up the slasher genre. Also starring Lisa Langlois (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Nest1987">THE

   What starts out as a strange and eerie experience quickly turns into

   killed and dismembered five pledges of the same fraternity and has 
   spent the past quarter century sitting motionless in his cell, the 
   outside world protected by a crucifix attached to his cell door. As 
   you can guess, the pledges fuck-up and release Malius (whose pale, 
   skeletal features make him a sight to behold) and he goes on a 
   killing spree at the college. There's a sub-plot involving a pledge 
   and his brother (the fraternity president) who are both in love with 
   the same girl, but it's not very interesting. Darren McGavin portrays 
   the two brothers' father, a survivor of the original massacre who 
   harbors some secrets of his own. The rest of the film is merely a 
   series of brutal (and unrated) killings, as Malius slashes throats, 
   removes limbs and thrusts an ice hammer through the bodies of 
   unsuspecting college kids having sex, including the welcome death of 
   a video peeping tom (Ted Clark, who looks like comedian Richard 
   Belzer on a herion binge). McGavin arrives to save his kids and 
   confesses that it was he who performed a satanic ritual twenty-five 
   years earlier, raising Malius from the dead (he thought it was a 
   harmless fraternity prank until it was too late). McGavin is then 
   stabbed in the back with his own ice hammer by Malius and as he lays 
   mortally wounded he tells the kids that only the reading of a magical 
   passage, performed at the original massacre site, will return Malius 
   to the grave. They do. He does. The end. Or is it? While this film 
   does have a few atmospheric touches (including a statue of Jesus on 
   the cross coming to life) and plenty of extreme gore, it is basic 
   &quot;Teens have sex, teens get killed&quot; formula filmmaking made

    This type of film went out of style years ago. Charles Cragin is 
   terrifying as Malius and one wishes that there were a better 
   storyline to showcase his talents (the ending of this film points the 
   way for a Part 2, but I doubt that will ever happen). Darren 
   McGavin's role in this film is no more than a extended cameo and he

   (2007) -</B> When one of the blurbs on the DVD package states 
   &quot;Amongst the greatest slasher flicks of all time&quot;, your 
   expectations are automatically set to &quot;high&quot;. Sadly, it 
   fails to meet those expectations, but I will give it points for being 
   extremely bloody and downright funny in spots. This Louisiana-set 
   (but filmed on sets in Los Angeles) horror comedy opens with a 
   father/son gator hunting team (played by Robert Englund and Joshua 
   Leonard) being savagely disemboweled and dismembered by some unknown 
   killer with superhuman powers. We then cut to Mardi Gras, where 
   downbeat Ben (Joel David Moore; the paranoid computer game genius 
   &quot;J.R.&quot; in <B><A HREF="grandmas_boy_2006.htm">GRANDMA'S BOY</A></B> 
   [2006]), who is trying to get over a recent breakup with his

    3</A></B> - 2000) into taking a haunted midnight swamp tour, run by 
   huckster Shawn (Parry Shen), who knows less about the swamp than his 
   paying customers, which includes know-it-all Mr. Parmetteo (Richard 
   Riehle) and his wife (Patriko Darbo); a Girls Gone Wild-type producer 
   named Doug Shapiro (Joel Murray) and two bimbos, Misty (Mercedes 
   McNab) and Jenna (Joleigh Fioreavianti), who doff their tops at the 
   drop of a <A HREF="hatchet_2007.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hatchet 2007 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="188" HEIGHT="268" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>hat;
    and morose local girl Marybeth (Tamara Feldman), who is the daughter 
   and sister of the two missing gator hunters. When the inexperienced 
   Shawn accidentally sinks the tour boat and Mr. Parmetteo is bitten on 
   the leg by a gator, the tour group must traverse the swamp at night. 
   Marybeth tells everyone that the swamp is haunted by the ghost of 
   Victor Crowley (Kane Hodder; also the film's Stunt Coordinator), a 
   horribly disfigured man who was accidentally axed in the head by his 
   father (also played by Hodder in flashbacks) when trying to save him 
   from a house fire (a prank gone wrong perpetrated by local kids with 
   fireworks). Victor makes his presence immediately known and begins 
   killing members of the tour group in extremely graphic ways, while 
   everyone bickers amongst themselves and reveal secrets about each 
   other (Some are damn funny, such as when Jenna reveals that she was 
   not accepted at New York University, so she had to attend Hoffstra 
   instead!). Only Ben and Marybeth are able to keep their wits about 
   them (not to mention their heads) as Victor dispatches the rest of 
   the group. The quick finale (a direct steal from the first <A HREF="friday_the_13th_1980.htm"><B>FRIDAY
    THE 13TH</B></A> [1980]) will have you cursing at the screen in 
   utter disappointment.&nbsp; The only way to watch this film is by way 
   of the unrated DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment. It did have a 
   limited theatrical run, but it was a heavily-cut R-rated edit, that 
   trimmed most of the bloody deaths. Director/scripter Adam Green (<B><A HREF="spiral_2007.htm">SPIRAL</A></B> 
   - 2007; co-directed by star Joel David Moore) spends too much time on 
   character development and jokey dialogue throughout the first half of 
   the film, but once Victor Crowley starts his killing spree, it's 
   pretty much a non-stop gorefest. Special effects master John Carl 
   Buechler (who has a cameo here as a swamp hick named Jack Cracker) 
   and his MMI effects house supply some truly eye-opening and, 
   refreshingly, non-CGI gore set-pieces, including bloody dismemberment 
   by hatchet, a head getting manually ripped apart at the jawline, a 
   head being twisted-off at the neck like a bottlecap, dismemberment 
   and decapitation by shovel, a face being ground to chuck by a 
   gas-powered belt sander (!), arms being ripped out of their sockets 
   and other bloody mayhem. Believe me when I say that nothing is left 
   to the imagination. Green's joke-filled script contains more groaners 
   than hits, but I found myself laughing out loud on several occasions. 
   It's also apparent that Green is a huge fan of slasher films, as he 
   slips in various homages to slasher flicks of the past, especially 
   the <B>FRIDAY THE 13TH</B> series (Parts <B><A HREF="friday_the_13th_1980.htm">1</A></B> 
   &amp; <B><A HREF="friday_the_13th_part_2_1981.htm">2</A></B> are 
   predominantly featured). My biggest complaint, though, is the sudden, 
   senseless ending, which either shows that Green could never figure 
   out a proper finale or he wanted to set it up for the inevitable 
   sequel. Either way, it's nearly an unforgivable cop-out. Die-hard 
   gorehounds should really enjoy this, though. It's well-made, decently 
   acted by a cast of familiar faces and bloody as hell. Tony Todd (who 
   is becoming the Cameron Mitchell of the new millennium) puts in a 
   cameo as the litigious-wary Reverend Zombie, a swamp tour guide who 
   refuses to take Ben and Marcus on a tour because his last customer 
   sued him. An <A HREF="http://www.anchorbayentertainment.com">Anchor

   including a &quot;making of&quot; documentary, plenty of 
   behind-the-scenes docs on the gore effects and other background info, 
   full-length commentaries by the cast and crew and a funny gag reel.

    While slightly better than its predecessor, this second sequel still 
   leaves a lot to be desired storywise, unless you watch these films 
   only for the gore. If that's all you want, this film delivers the 
   grue in bucket loads. It begins where the first sequel left off, 
   where Marybeth (Danielle Harris, who is still as bad as she was in 
   the first sequel, replacing Tamara Feldman in the original film) 
   shoots Victor Crowley (Kane Hodder) in the face with a shotgun 
   (although it looks like much more damage was done to his face in the 
   first sequel) and walks away, only to have Crowley get up and chase 
   her. During their struggle, Crowley falls on an operating chainsaw 
   and is cut in half from stem to stern (Outrageously graphic, but 
   don't chainsaws have safety switches so this type of thing doesn't 
   happen?). Marybeth, who is soaked in blood, takes a piece of 
   Crowley's face and walks into the local police station, still 
   carrying the shotgun. She is immediately arrested, washed down by a 
   power hose (What about preserving the evidence?) and put in a cell 
   under suspicion of multiple murders, where Sheriff Fowler (Zach 
   Galligan, a long career slide since his starring role in <B><A HREF="gremlins_1984.htm">GREMLINS</A></B> 
   - 1984) interrogates Marybeth and she tells him that Victor Crowley 
   was responsible, not her. Not believing her, he sends out a search 
   team into the area she was in the swamps, only for the team to 
   discover <A HREF="hatchet_3_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hatchet iii poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="191" HEIGHT="286" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>multiple
    body parts and bodies missing most of their skin. As the Sheriff 
   heads to the area, with a boat crew of paramedics (including Andrew 
   [Parry Shen, who returns from the first two films, but in a totally 
   different role] and Randy [Sean Whalen; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LaidToRest2009">LAID
    TO REST</A></B> - 2009]) and a S.W.A.T. team (headed by Hawes [Derek 
   Mears, who played Jason Vorhees in the 2009 <B><A HREF="friday_the_13th_2009.htm">FRIDAY
    THE 13TH</A></B> reboot]), the Sheriffs ex-wife, Amanda (Caroline 
   Williams; <B><A HREF="texas_chainsaw_massacre_2b.htm">THE TEXAS 
   CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2</A></B> - 1986, who overacts here to the point of 
   parody), a disgraced reporter who hopes to prove her theory that 
   Victor Crowley is real, talks Deputy Winslow (Robert Diago DoQui) 
   into releasing Marybeth from her cell to defeat Victor Crowley once 
   and for all. Amanda believes that only the people related to the 
   persons responsible for Victor Crowley's father's death can kill him 
   (Marybeth is the daughter of one of the deceased men, played by 
   Robert Englund in the first film), so she, Marybeth and Deputy 
   Winslow drive to the house of Abbott McMullen (Sid Haig, in a funny 
   cameo performance as a hard-of-hearing racist), who has the cremated 
   remains of Crowley's father in an urn. Amanda thinks that if Marybeth 
   gives the urn to Victor Crowley, he will disappear for good and not 
   be able to repeat the same day over-and-over. After nearly everyone 
   is killed in the swamp by Crowley (gore-soaked deaths, including the 
   decapitation of Sheriff Fowler using the gas-powered belt sander, 
   which was also used in the first two films but doesn't exist in real 
   life), the trio turn up in the swamp, where Amanda and Deputy Winslow 
   are butchered by Crowley. Marybeth manages to throw the ashes of his 
   father on Crowley's face after she is impaled on a tree branch. 
   Crowley begins to disintegrate, but Marybeth makes sure that he is 
   dead by blowing his body to bits with a shotgun blast. As Marybeth 
   begins to takes her final breaths (?), the film cuts to black and the 
   movie is over (a trademark of this franchise).&nbsp; None of the film 
   makes any sense at all and there are plot holes galore, but there are 
   a few redeeming bits and pieces (pardon the pun), including a 
   uncredited cameo from the first film's star, Joel David Moore, where 
   we finally learn his fate. The gore is laid on hot and heavy and is 
   very well done (by &quot;Aunt Dolly's Garage&quot;), but the film has 
   a overall cheapness to it. Adam Green doesn't direct this time (he 
   just wrote the screenplay and executive produced it, along with six 
   other people), handing over the reins to freshman director BJ 
   McDonnell, who usually is an expert Steadicam operator on such films 
   as <B><A HREF="collector_2009.htm">THE COLLECTOR</A></B> (2009) and 
   its sequel <B><A HREF="collection_2012.htm">THE COLLECTION</A></B> 
   (2012) and worked on the first two <B><A HREF="#Hatchet2007">HATCHET</A></B> 
   films as well. McDonnell does all he can with a weak script (there's 
   a funny scene concerning a man's testicles hanging from a tree 
   branch), but it's apparent most of the film's meager budget was spent 
   flying everyone to Louisiana (the film's locale and the first time 
   the series has filmed there, lensed during the Spring and Summer of 
   2012, where many of the crew were hospitalized with numerous bug 
   bites and heat exhaustion), the massive gore effects (all physical 
   and no CGI enhancement, which is always a plus), weapons fire and 
   explosions. But if you're just in the mood for a blood-spattered 
   gorefest, you may overlook the film's many shortcomings and just go 
   along for the ride. I'm sure there will be a Part 4 sometime in the 
   future, but as of this review, none has been announced. I just hope 
   they replace Danielle Harris this time. She's great on the eyes (she 
   has a nude scene in this, revealing that she has a giant tattoo on 
   her back), but her acting in the two sequels borderlines on 
   amateurish. Also starring Cody Blue Snider, Rileah Vanderbilt, Jason

   (2003) -</B> Here's an original idea: Someone sporting a latex horror 
   mask and a black hooded sweatshirt is killing the strippers who work 
   at a titty bar run by DiAngelo (Gino Maurizio). The unknown killer is 
   particularly interested in the strippers' hands, as he has the 
   tendency to cut them off with his trusty sharp steel hatchet and take 
   them with him. Claudia (Cheryl Burns), a college girl by day/stripper 
   by night (are there any other kind?), is dating cop Sonny (Jon 
   Briddell), who supports Claudia's night job (stripping is helping her 
   pay her way through law school), but really wants to marry her and 
   get her out of the stripping lifestyle. Every time he goes to pop the 
   question, another stripper ends up dead and he has to leave to 
   investigate. The list of suspects (i.e. red herrings) is rather 
   small, but obvious: There's Daniel Strong (Daniel Brown), a 
   ex-boyfriend of one of the dead strippers who was just released from 
   jail; Marty (Matt McDonald), a perverted <A HREF="hatchetman_2003.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hatchetman dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="203" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>auto
    mechanic who lives in the same apartment complex as all the 
   strippers (a plot device that is too coincidental to believe) and 
   likes to sneak into their apartments and try on their underwear; 
   apartment manager Rob (Chris Moir), who has a crush on snooty 
   stripper Star (Mia Zottoli) and has installed a spycam in her 
   apartment so he can watch her; and Rob's friend Curtis (Darren Keefe 
   Reiher), a surveillance specialist and apartment maintenance man who 
   has a thing for novice stripper Molly (Nina Tapanin). When stripper 
   Chloe (Racquel Richard) is found dead in her apartment with her hands 
   missing (her nose-picking days are over), Claudia decides this is the 
   perfect time to re-evaluate her life. Does she give up stripping and 
   marry Sonny? Hell, no, she does the exact opposite! She breaks up 
   with Sonny, the only person who can protect her, and continues 
   stripping, while trying to solve the murders on her own (she is such 
   a fucking idiot!). When Rob spots someone in a black hooded 
   sweatshirt in Star's apartment on his spycam, he alerts a cop, who 
   enters Star's apartment and shoots Marty (who was only there to 
   ransack Star's panty drawer), killing him. Star is then killed in her 
   car, Daniel is arrested and a cop is killed in the apartment after 
   Daniel is captured, which proves that Daniel is innocent and the 
   killer can be only one of two people. The idiotic Claudia and the 
   rest of the strippers celebrate Daniel's arrest by partying with Rob 
   at Curtis' home deep in the woods (c'mon now, I may be gullible but 
   I'm not fuckin' gullible!). I think everyone with half a brain can 
   guess what happens next.&nbsp; Well, if it's tits and ass you are 
   looking for, <B><A HREF="hatchetman_2003b.htm">HATCHETMAN</A></B> 
   certainly delivers, much more so than any horror film in recent 
   memory. Hardly five minutes go by without some good-looking gal 
   exposing her breasts (some natural, but most silicon-enhanced) or 
   giving us some gratuitous crotch shots, but the horror elements 
   usually amount to nothing more than showing us the killer swinging 
   his hatchet, followed by shots of blood splashing against walls, 
   windows and other objects. Director Robert Tiffi (a.k.a. Robert 
   Tiffe; <B><A HREF="sword_of_honor_1994.htm">SWORD OF HONOR</A></B> - 
   1994) does let us see some of the handless corpses after the fact (as 
   well as a pretty lame CGI-enhanced throat slitting), but the 
   screenplay, co-written by Tiffe and Steven Jones, just piles-on one 
   plot convenience and contrivance after another until all the viewer 
   can do is roll their eyes in disbelief. Not only are we expected to 
   believe that all the strippers live in the same apartment complex and 
   that Claudia couldn't have picked the worse time to break-up with 
   Sonny, we are also supposed to believe that Claudia is better at 
   police work than her ex-boyfriend, based solely on the fact that she 
   will soon be entering law school! Once you hear the killer's 
   motivation for the hand removals (&quot;Mommy did bad things with her 
   hands!&quot;), I doubt you'll stay until the film's sorry non-ending. 
   The whole film plays like some third-rate Americanized giallo film, 
   so why don't you watch one of those instead? The acting runs from 
   decent to truly awful (Chris Moir as Rob is simply terrible) and the 
   cinematography is sometimes very atmospheric, but <B>HATCHETMAN</B> 
   fails as a horror film thanks to it's absurd screenplay full of 
   coincidences and mind-numbing motivations. As a T&amp;A flick, on the 
   other hand, it succeeds completely. Also starring Elizabeth Ryan, 
   Fonta Sawyer, Leila Renae and Christina Lepanto. A Showtime

   During the mid-to-late-90's, producer Roger Corman shot several

   back-to-back with this film, a short, but not-so-sweet, supernatural 
   tale based on the Henry James short story &quot;The Ghostly 
   Rental&quot; (the film's shooting title). The film opens up in 1800's 
   Boston, where James Farrow (Andrew Bowen; <B><A HREF="big_bad_wolf_2006.htm">BIG
    BAD WOLF</A></B> - 2006) and his secret girlfriend Sarah (Aideen 
   O'Donnell) find what they think is an abandoned mansion and make 
   love. A couple of months later, Sarah discovers she is pregnant, so 
   artist college student James convinces her to get an illegal 
   abortion, otherwise he will have to drop out of school. He takes her 
   to a sleazy back alley abortionist/doctor, where something goes wrong 
   and James is forced to take Sarah to a motel room above a bar, while 
   she slowly bleeds to death. He leaves the room, telling her he will 
   be right back and will get her help, but the callous James leaves her 
   there while he goes back to his normal business. He catches a case of 
   the guilts and goes back to the motel, only to discover the police 
   carrying her bloody corpse away and put it on a cart. For some 
   reason, James decides to go back to the mansion where he got Sarah 
   pregnant, only to see a ghostly Sarah staring back at him through a 
   window. He is also nearly trampled to death by a horse ridden by the 
   sickly Professor Ambrose (Michael York, with huge muttonchops), who 
   is racing away from the mansion at a high rate of speed. Professor 
   Ambrose teaches at the same low-class college that James goes to and 
   has an obsession with death (it all has to do with something that 
   happened <A HREF="haunting_of_hell_house_1998.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/haunting of hell house 1998 dvd9 front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="228" HEIGHT="320" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>in
    his past). James is somehow drawn to that mansion, where he passes 
   out on the porch and has a strange dream of a naked, bleeding Sarah 
   lying on the floor while the room fills up with a geyser of blood 
   (most of the bloody visions are taken from the cost-cutting Corman's <B><A HREF="haunting_of_morella_1990.htm">THE
    HAUNTING OF MORELLA</A></B> [1990], which wouldn't be a problem if 
   there wasn't a trailer for that film on this DVD and it shows some of 
   the same images we see in this film!), only to be chased away by a 
   cane-swinging Professor Ambrose, who says that this is his house. The 
   police are investigating the death of Sarah and the lead Inspector on 
   the case, Lt. Ryan (Mike Finn), checks out the room Sarah died in and 
   comments, &quot;We are looking for a man with dirty fingernails.&quot;
    Meanwhile, James' bloody nightmares are now manifesting themselves 
   in the real world, as he wakes up from a nightmare with bloody 
   scratches on his stomach. James watches Sarah's funeral from afar 
   (where he has another strange waking nightmare), where he notices a 
   sickly-looking Professor Ambrose sitting in the graveyard. James 
   tells Professor Ambrose that he is being haunted by the spirit of a 
   dead woman and he believes the Professor is experiencing something 
   similar, too. Professor Ambrose tells James to meet him at his study 
   tomorrow night and not to breathe a word about it to anyone (rumors 
   from some of James' college friends believe Professor Ambrose left 
   teaching at the exclusive Harvard University and took a low-paying 
   job at their meager college because he murdered someone in his past). 
   At the study, Professor Ambrose tells James at one time he was 
   married and he and his wife had a happy life in the mansion that 
   James is drawn to. His wife got pregnant and died at childbirth, 
   leaving the Professor to take care of his daughter on his own. He and 
   his daughter made a pact with each other to look out for one another 
   for all time. Years pass and Professor Ambrose comes home early after 
   giving a lecture at Harvard, finding his daughter Lucy (Claudia 
   Christian; <B><A HREF="hidden_1987.htm">THE HIDDEN</A></B> - 1987) 
   kissing and getting ready to make love to a man the Professor never 
   met before. When Lucy tells her father that they are going to get 
   married, Professor Ambrose reminds Lucy of the pact they made and 
   tells her intended husband that if he ever sees him again, he will 
   destroy the man's reputation (and, back then, he had the power to do 
   so). He also tells Lucy that she is dead to him now and storms out of 
   the mansion. A few weeks later, Professor Ambrose comes to his senses 
   and returns to the mansion, only to find a note written by the 
   intended husband saying that Lucy slipped into a coma and died. From 
   that day on, Professor Ambrose became a broken man. He also became a 
   haunted one, too. Lt. Ryan is getting closer to the truth in Sarah's 
   death and James increasingly sees the ghostly Sarah as she creepily 
   asks him to join her in the Netherworld. Professor Ambrose tells 
   James in the cemetery that one night while he was sleeping at the 
   mansion, he was awoken by something or someone scratching at his 
   bedroom door. Just as he puts the chain on the door, a female hand 
   comes thrusting through the opening. The apparition of Lucy appears 
   that same night and tries to strangle Professor Ambrose while he 
   sleeps, so he decides to sell the mansion. Every time a potential 
   buyer comes to look at the mansion, the spirit of Lucy scares them 
   away. One night, Lucy's ghost appears to her father and tells him to 
   leave the house to her. She will be the tenant and gives him a bag of 
   coins. There was one condition attached: Professor Ambrose must 
   return to the mansion every week to pick up the rent and drink a 
   glass of wine (something he refused to do when Lucy announced she was 
   getting married). Professor Ambrose tells James that none of the 
   coins are dated later than his daughter's death. He survives on this 
   ghostly rental (the job at the college pays but a mere pittance), but 
   the line between dream and reality have eroded for him (he also seems 
   to get sicker by the day and coughs a lot). James wants to go with 
   Professor Ambrose on his next rent pickup, but the Professor refuses 
   and tells him to go out and live his life (James has never told 
   Ambrose that he was responsible for Sarah's death). Professor Ambrose 
   leaves the cemetery, telling James not to follow him, but James sees 
   Sarah's ghost (there is blood coming out of her eyes and mouth) and 
   decides that he must break his promise to the Professor, if not only 
   for him to keep his sanity. Lt. Ryan finds the back alley abortionist 
   and arrests him, but he is able to point out James walking down the 
   street as the person who brought Sarah to him and a footchase 
   commences. James and an officer tussle, but James gets away, losing 
   his sketchpad in the process. James hides-out at friend Fletcher's 
   (Jason Cottle) house, but the nightmares won't stop, as Sarah keeps 
   haunting him (this time he sees her stab him in the back and we get a 
   fleeting glimpse of James' innards spilling out his stomach). Lt. 
   Ryan is able to locate Professor Ambrose (who is now at the point of 
   death) through the drawings in James' sketchpad, which leads Lt. Ryan 
   to Fletcher's house. James is able to escape through a window and a 
   severely ill Ambrose picks up James off the streets and brings him to 
   his home. A dying Ambrose tells James that finally telling his story 
   to someone has released him of his otherworldly torments and he will 
   now die in peace. James believes the only way to redeem himself is to 
   go to the mansion and give himself to Sarah, but once he gets to the 
   mansion, what he discovers is nothing he expected. It seems that Lucy 
   was never dead. She was tormenting her father for breaking up her 
   wedding and was slowly poisoning him with small doses of arsenic in 
   the glasses of wine he was drinking every week when he picked up the 
   rent. James drinks the glass of wine (Lucy tells him that this was to 
   be the final glass of wine for her father, as she added a lethal dose 
   of arsenic in it) and is the captured by the police and thrown in 
   prison. It what turns out to be the film's most ironic scene, the 
   back alley abortionist is his next cellmate and volunteers to look at 
   a very ill James. The abortionist tells Lt. Ryan that James will have 
   to wait for the poison to leave his system because to induce vomiting 
   will kill him (he then has a hearty laugh at James' expense). Lucy 
   goes to visit her father at his home, only to discover he has died. 
   As Lucy is sitting on the stairs of the mansion (the very same place 
   James and Sarah made love in the beginning of the film), she hears 
   her father's ghostly voice and the mansion explodes (Talk about 
   retribution!). James (who has black gunk dribbling out of his mouth) 
   dies in his straw-strewn prison cell, his last words being 
   &quot;Forgive me.&quot;, as the abortionist wails away in the next 
   cell. It seems that sometimes being alive is much worse than death 
   itself (but don't tell Catholics that!).&nbsp; This is a tidy little 
   supernatural tale that does manage to send some shivers up and down 
   your spine. Michael York (<B><A HREF="omega_code_1999.htm">THE OMEGA CODE</A></B> 
   - 1999) is fantastic as the tortured soul who believes that he is 
   being haunted from beyond the grave when, in fact, it is simply an 
   act of living revenge. I believe it is some of the best acting he has 
   done in any film he has appeared in. I can honestly say I wasn't 
   surprised by the ending because the death of Lucy is tossed off as an 
   aside and we never see her body or funeral, just the letter Professor 
   Ambrose finds on the fireplace mantle. This is one of two of Roger 
   Corman's Ireland-filmed movies to take place in the United States 
   because Mitch Marcus finished the last film early, so Marcus and 
   co-screenwriter Lev L. Spiro (using the pseudonym &quot;L.L. 
   Shapira&quot;, who wrote the screenplay to Corman's non-supernatural 
   Ireland-lensed <B><A HREF="game_of_death_2000.htm">THE GAME OF DEATH</A></B> 
   [2000], an adaptation of Robert Lewis Stevenson's &quot;The Suicide 
   Club&quot;, who also directed the rather gory sci-fi comedy <B><A HREF="welcome_to_planet_earth_1997.htm">WELCOME
    TO PLANET EARTH</A></B> [1997] and plenty of A-List TV series) 
   whipped up a quick script and filmed this one in less than two weeks 
   (using much of the gore and nudity shots from previous Corman films, 
   like the one I mentioned above). Like the other three 
   previously-mentioned made-in-Ireland haunted house films, these are 
   rather good Corman productions and better than most of Corman's 
   output during that time (All four films use the same mansion in 
   County Galway, Ireland). It could be because of the beautiful Irish 
   scenery (this is the only one of the four that is a period film), but 
   it is Michael York that makes this film worth watching. <B><A HREF="haunting_of_hell_house_1998b.htm">THE
    HAUNTING OF HELL HOUSE</A></B> is only available on DVD in 
   fullscreen, so some company like Code Red should pick-up all of 
   Corman's Ireland films and release them in widescreen. They are all 
   well-made films that would benefit even more if they were shown in 
   their original aspect ratio. They may be B-Films, but they are highly 
   enjoyable and good for a few scares. Also starring Brian Glanney,

    Mitchell) has a hard time believing Ingrid since she has a history 
   of accusing men of rape since she was sexually abused as a little 
   girl. Even the alcoholic Sheriff (Aldo Ray) has his doubts about her 
   claims. More women end up getting murdered by the scissor-weilding 
   psycho, with one of the bodies being dumped at Ingrid's farm, left as 
   chicken food for the chickens. The list of suspects is large: Frankie 
   (William Gray Espy), the local delivery boy who's a real horndog; 
   Uncle Carl, whose appearance in town coincides with the murders; Bill 
   Spry (Robert Hippard), the new guy in town who happens to be in 
   Ingrid's church choir; the Sheriff, who takes his time in coming to 
   Ingrid's rescue; and Ingrid herself, who cannot stand the touch of a 
   man and who's religious convictions are on the obsessive side. Are 
   Ingrid's attacks real or in her imagination? Was she raped by Frankie 
   while she was taking a shower or was that a fantasy? When Bill Spry 
   is shot dead after trying to rape a girl, everyone in the town, 
   except Ingrid, thinks the killer has been silenced. She kills Frankie 
   after he tries to rape her again and Uncle Carl buries him in the

   loon as Frankie is alive, the police find her favorite goat buried in 
   the back yard and her Uncle Carl has never lived with her. She 
   commits suicide by slitting her wrists in the bathtub, the same thing 
   her mother did years before. An autopsy reveals that Ingrid died a 
   virgin and all of the memories that she had of being sexually abused 
   as a child were all in her head. When Uncle Carl comes to town to 
   claim the body, he tells the Sheriff Ingrid's sad history. Flashbacks

   and most fans of horror will find that it moves far too slow. As a 
   study of an unstable mind and the things it takes to trigger the 
   insanity, it hit its' mark. As a horror film, it doesn't get too 
   bloody and, as I have mentioned before, it crawls at a snail's pace.

   (2013) -</B> In Mobile, Alabama (filmed on location), the police 
   surround an abandoned building. When the S.W.A.T. team enters, they 
   find the rotting remains of six young girls, their bodies so badly 
   decomposed, it will take a coroner to identify them. A serial killer 
   named Guffin (Shannon Box) is chasing girl #7 in the adjoining woods 
   and he kills her before the police arrest him. He's a brooding, 
   overweight man whose stare could melt ice. The last time we see him 
   (for the moment), he is in the back of a police car being transported 
   to a penitentiary. We then see a young couple, Steven (Jeremy D. Ivy) 
   and Amanda (Sherri Eakin; <B><A HREF="earthrise_2014.htm">EARTHRISE</A></B> 
   - 2014) at a barbecue joint talking about making the long ride to 
   participate in Steven's Uncle Morgan's (Richard Tyson; <B><A HREF="#FlightLivingDead">FLIGHT
    OF THE LIVING DEAD: OUTBREAK ON A PLANE</A></B> - 2006; a character 
   actor I have admired since the 1980's) annual Halloween Hayride, 
   where characters such as &quot;Pitchfork&quot; and &quot;Rawhead 
   Bloodybones&quot; run out of the darkness and scare the crap out of 
   the people on the hayride. There is also a stop in the middle of the 
   ride, where all the paying<A HREF="hayride_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hayride 2013 poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="213" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   customers take a scary tour through a terror-filled barn. We are then 
   at a crime scene on the side of the road, where there is a dead 
   police officer in his car, an unknown male dead in the bushes nearby 
   and Guffin, the serial killer, has escaped. Detective Loomis 
   (Corlandos Scott; his screen name is probably a tribute to Donald 
   Pleasence in <B><A HREF="halloween_1978.htm">HALLOWEEN</A></B> - 
   1978), the lead detective on the case, says no one really knows 
   Guffin, except he is &quot;bat-shit crazy&quot; and his next move 
   would be to find clothes so he can discard his bright orange 
   jumpsuit. Since neither of the two dead men are Guffin's large size, 
   chances are he will be traveling to the nearest farm to try and find 
   clothing. It looks like if they don't catch this murderous bastard, 
   there just may be a new Pitchfork for the Hayride this year (You may 
   think you know what is going to happen, but most of you would be 
   wrong). Steven takes Amanda to meet Uncle Morgan, but first Steven 
   runs into cousin Corey (Jeremy Sande; <B><A HREF="universal_soldier_day_of_reckoning_2012.htm">UNIVERSAL
    SOLDIER: DAY OF RECKONING</A></B> - 2012), who is glad to see Steven 
   back in town, but they always make fun of each other (Corey gets the 
   last licks in by calling Steven a &quot;dick&quot; and then driving 
   off in his truck). Uncle Morgan is a womanizing letch (he has two 
   women with him; one called &quot;Beautiful&quot; [Kara Riann Brown] 
   and one called &quot;Dumb&quot; [Kelly Houk]), but he is also a very 
   good guy who cares about the quality of the Halloween Hayride to make 
   sure that people get their money's worth (He jokingly hits on Amanda, 
   but pulls Steven aside and tells him not to let this one go. She 
   seems like a keeper. Steven agrees.). A short distance away, Guffin 
   steals some rope from the back of a truck and kills the driver 
   (off-screen) with a sledgehammer. Around a campfire that night, 
   Steven asks Uncle Morgan who is playing Pitchfork this year (Morgan 
   retired &quot;Rawhead Bloodybones&quot; from the hayride when his 
   grandfather passed away, since he was the one who created and played 
   him), but since Steven is just a paying customer this year (but he is 
   still family and helps all he can before the hayride commences), 
   Morgan won't tell him. Morgan relays a story to everyone (in a really 
   bad flashback technique) that Pitchfork was once an actual person. He 
   was a farmer named R.W. Rayborn (Wayne Dean), who always carried a 
   pitchfork with him whenever his beautiful daughter was with him to 
   keep all the young men away from her. Morgan believes Pitchfork 
   murdered his wife (with a meat cleaver) for letting his daughter run 
   away with a young man. Since Pitchfork doesn't know who the young man 
   is, he goes from farm to farm killing everyone in his path, both man 
   and woman, leaving a trail of dead bodies in his wake. Morgan 
   believes that Pitchfork never found his daughter or the young man and 
   then Corey comes jumping out of the darkness carrying a pitchfork, 
   scaring the shit out of everyone around the campfire. Morgan says 
   that the story of Pitchfork is still true. The night before the 
   Halloween Hayride, it rains like hell, destroying a lot of the props 
   outside, but Morgan is an optimist and his unending drive to rebuild 
   everything is infectious, so everyone (including Amanda) chips in to 
   restore the hayride's attractions to their former state. Two police 
   officers are doing a house-to-house search for Guffin and they check 
   out an abandoned house, only to be run through and chopped-up with a 
   machete by someone dressed like Pitchfork. The Halloween Hayride 
   begins and Morgan only has one rule: Make the first couple of rides 
   children-friendly so they don't go home scared shitless (this man 
   really cares about his customers), but go balls-to-the-wall on all 
   the rides after that. But I highly doubt that Morgan meant that in 
   the literal sense. Pretty soon, Pitchfork is using his favorite 
   weapon to start dispatching some of the hayride riders. Detective 
   Loomis and Deputy Wincer (Randy Hicks) show up at the hayride and 
   Wincer tells Loomis that the legend of Pitchfork is real (most 
   legends are based on true events that are over-amplified, except this 
   one). By the time they get to the hayride, half of the workers left 
   or are dead and a S.W.A.T. team finds the remains of the two police 
   officers in the abandoned house, so Loomis and Wincer go there. As 
   more and more people end up dead (and hidden), Morgan wants to put on 
   the last hayride for the night, but he is short-handed, so Amanda 
   volunteers to portray the victim that gets pulled off the cart by the 
   resident psycho. By now, Pitchfork is killing people out in the open, 
   because the audience (many of them drunk) think that it is part of 
   the show. When Steven accidentally knocks himself out in the woods 
   and comes to, he discovers a dead body and races to save Amanda on 
   the hayride. Pitchfork plants an axe in the skull of a Jason Voorhees-wannabe
    and then attacks everyone on the hayride with a chainsaw (and 
   killing a few), Morgan intervenes and tries to keep Pitchfork busy 
   with a machete. It doesn't last long, as Pitchfork thrusts the 
   chainsaw into Morgan's body and kidnaps Amanda (it will make sense in 
   a little while). A couple of days earlier, Morgan complained that 
   someone stole all his bear traps and we now see them in use, as the 
   survivors of the hayride run into the woods and have their legs 
   caught in bear traps or killed with other booby-traps. Steven makes 
   it to the hayride a little too late, where he finds his Uncle Morgan 
   dead and severed body parts littering the hayride carts, so he grabs 
   a machete and goes out to save Amanda and get a little payback, to 
   boot. He finds Amanda tied-up in the Terror Barn, the hayride's 
   midway-through walk-through horror maze, and gets into a fight with 
   Pitchfork. Both an untied Amanda and Steven are still trapped in the 
   barn's maze (Pitchfork sees a fake arm come out of a wall to scare 
   customers, pulls it out and throws it to the floor). Pitchfork runs 
   his favorite weapon through one of Steven's hands, but Steven manages 
   to get away and runs outside. Amanda is now being chased by 
   Pitchfork, but he is impaled in the stomach by a broken handle of a 
   pitchfork sticking out of the ground. He pulls himself off the handle 
   and moves closer and closer to Steven and Amanda, but he falls to the 
   ground just before he gets to them. Amanda then tells <A HREF="hayride_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hayride 2013 redbox ad8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="372" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Steven
    she is pregnant (Really? This is the right time to make such an 
   announcement?) and Corey comes jumping out of the darkness telling 
   the couple that everyone is dead (a little late bonehead!). Detective 
   Loomis, Deputy Wincer and the police force finally show up, where at 
   least a dozen people are dead and dozens injured (Thankfully, bear 
   traps don't kill unless you fall face-first into one of them). When 
   Loomis and Wincer pull the burlap bag off of Pitchfork's face, it 
   turns out to be R.W. Rayborn (Who we see in flashback kill serial 
   killer Guffin for being in his barn. Imagine that; a serial killer 
   being killed by another serial killer.). Wincer asks Loomis, &quot;Is 
   he dead?&quot;&nbsp; to which Loomis replies, &quot;No!&quot; (Amanda 
   reminded Rayborn of his daughter). Start the end credits, but stick 
   through to the end for two small stingers which sets up the basis for 
   the 2015 sequel <B><A HREF="hayride_2_2015.htm">HAYRIDE 2</A></B>, 
   which contains some of the same characters in this film (Steven, 
   Amanda, Corey, Detective Loomis, Pitchfork, all played by the same 
   actors here and made by the same director/screenwriter) and borrows a 
   lot of footage from this film (which is why Richard Tyson is listed 
   as being in the cast). Only this time Pitchfork is a bigot, too (look 
   for clues in this film when the two police officers check out the 
   abandoned house) This is enjoyable for what it is, but totally 
   predictable, especially to fans of slasher films. I guessed that 
   Guffin wasn't Pitchfork halfway through the film and most slasher 
   fanatics probably did, too. The always dependable Richard Tyson (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackWatersPond2009">THE
    BLACK WATERS OF ECHO'S POND</A></B> - 2009) throws himself into the 
   role even though it is obvious this was a low-budget film that was 
   going directly to DVD and streaming. He's a dog in this film when it 
   comes to women, but family is his top priority, proving so by paying 
   tribute to his grandfather by taking &quot;Rawhead Bloodybones&quot; 
   out of the hayride because his grandfather portrayed him. This is 
   director/producer/screenwriter Terron R. Parsons' first full-length 
   film and the sequel is his second. While this film gets generally 
   favorable reviews (Hint: Never read the reviews on IMDb because you 
   will probably not watch any film, ever), the sequel doesn't fare too 
   well because too much footage from this film is cribbed. You can tell 
   most of the actors are local, because they have that Alabama twang 
   which just sounds like poetry to people like myself and makes the 
   film more realistic. Besides the awful flashback technique used to 
   tell Pitchfork's origin, the technical aspects are good. So just put 
   your brain in neutral and go along for the bloody hayride. Oh yes, 
   there will be blood! Also starring Josh Nelson, Jessica Blevins, 
   Mitch Bryars Jr., Dustin Hicks, Brandon Wright, Tiffany Parsons

    JACK</A><A NAME="HazardJack2013"></A> (2013) -</B> In slasher films, 
   there is usually no boundary that you can't cross, but I take 
   exception to this one because the villain is a returning soldier from 
   Afghanistan suffering from PTSD. I know our government and the 
   Veterans Administration treat many of our returning soldiers with 
   emotional problems or war-caused brain damage as disposable goods 
   (which is why we have private charities like the Wounded Warrior 
   Project, of which I am a proud member), but to make one a ruthless 
   killer for the sake of showing some &quot;social relevance&quot; is a 
   slap in the face to every soldier that returned home after putting 
   their lives on the line for our safety. It's just<A HREF="hazard_jack_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hazard jack dvd9 front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="213" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   irresponsible. I consider <B><A HREF="hazard_jack_2013b.htm">HAZARD JACK</A></B> 
   the filmic equivalent of the Veterans Administration. In other words, 
   it pretends to care about soldiers coming home emotionally scarred, 
   but all it really does is exploit them. The film begins with our 
   faceless killer (he wears a hard hat with a tinted plastic visor over 
   his face or the camera makes sure that his face is not shown 
   (probably because he was played by two muscular stuntmen, Quincy 
   Taylor and Will Harris) torturing a girl at the decade-abandoned 
   Railroad Hospital, her screams heard by a neighbor who calls the 
   security dispatcher to report it. He sends a guard to go check out 
   the hospital, but Jack ends up running a drill bit through his head 
   with a portable drill (at least I think it was his head since he dies 
   so quickly). After the opening credits (which are full of Jack's 
   nightmarish visions of being in Afghanistan and losing his girlfriend 
   back home), Jack is called into the office of his boss (Joe Orrach), 
   who runs a construction company, and he chastizes Jack for his 
   violent outbursts while paying him lip service about appreciating him 
   serving our country (The boss says, &quot;My son has done two tours 
   himself!&quot;, but he has no idea what psychological damage that war 
   has done to many soldiers). While the boss is talking, all we see is 
   Jack's hand clenching tighter and tighter, because he knows what is 
   about to come. He fires Jack (he calls him &quot;James&quot;) on the 
   spot and denotes that old standby since 9-11: Zero Tolerance. The 
   idiotic boss tells Jack that he needs to get some help (without a job 
   or health insurance?) and stupidly extends his hand like Jack would 
   shake it (Would you?). Jack leaves the office before he does 
   something stupid. We are then introduced to a group of obnoxious 
   college students (Wait until you get a gander of the oversized 
   eyeglasses dyke Stella [Alison Lani] wears. She couldn't be more of a 
   charicature if she tried!), as they plan on using the abandoned 
   Railroad Hospital as the site of their annual paintball &quot;Capture 
   The Flag&quot; wargame. Randall (Josh Jacques) says, &quot;We don't 
   go looking for trouble!&quot;, while his best friend Kyle (Zachary 
   Meyer) finishes, &quot;But it always seems to find us!&quot; I don't 
   think they will be equipped to handle the trouble they will soon walk 
   into. Of course, the good girl, Bridget (Amanda Maddox), has a secret 
   she is harboring from boyfriend Dillon (Macauley Gray) and she is the 
   spitting image of the girl who dumped Jack (How's that for the king 
   of coincidences?). When Jack sees Bridget entering the hospital, he 
   loses it and drags another unknown girl by her leg while she screams 
   bloody murder. He takes her into a basement room and impales her 
   stomach with a jackhammer (as blood and gore splatters against the 
   wall and the camera lens). Our partying group doesn't hear a thing (I 
   mean a loud jackhammer? C'mon now!). Before these stupid college kids 
   start their wargame, they get drunk, high, have sex and Randall &amp; 
   Kyle play a game of strip paintball with bimbos Muffy (Ashley Walsh) 
   and Barbie (Deanna Meske), where the girls show off their silicon 
   boob jobs and the guys show their naked asses (something for 
   everyone). As Jack has some more Afghanistan flashbacks, he chops his 
   latest female victim into pieces with a meat cleaver (off-screen). To 
   add clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, cell phones don't work in the 
   abandoned hospital, so some of the students go exploring the dark 
   hallways with flashlights, where nerd Earl (Kevin Sporman) and Dillon 
   are nearly killed by Jack, but don't even know it. All the college 
   kids gather together and pick sides for the two teams and plan on 
   starting their wargame at Midnight (They don't even wear protective 
   gear like a vest or goggles. Anyone who has played paintball knows 
   that if you get hit in an unprotected area, it stings like a 
   motherfucker and leaves a nasty welt.). Bridget, who has been moody 
   since she arrived at the hospital, finally tells Dillon that she is 
   pregnant, but instead of breaking up with her (like she thought he 
   would), he is overjoyed and tells her that they will make great 
   parents. Before you can say &quot;Jack be nimble, Jack be 
   quick.&quot;, our killer decapitates both Randall and Muffy with a 
   meat cleaver while they are having sex (This is the first sight of 
   actual physical gore, as the headless bodies still thrust away at 
   each other!) and Jack walks away with their heads in his hands. Jack 
   then uses a nailgun to pin Kyle's hands to a wall before he delivers 
   a nail right between his eyes and he drags a screaming Barbie away. 
   The rest of the college kids hear her screams and, instead of staying 
   together while they investigate, they break off into groups of two 
   (just like every other stupid slasher film). It turns out that Stella 
   is not a dyke at all, as she makes love to nerd Earl. Amateur 
   filmmaker LaDanian (Jason O'Neil Hudson) is the next victim, as Jack 
   runs a drillbit through a door and it impales LaDanian's back and 
   comes out his stomach. The pregnant Bridget leaves a sleeping Dillon 
   and does some investigating herself, where she sees a pack of rats 
   feeding on what looks like the remains of a cat and then a 
   dismembered human hand lying on the floor. She screams and tries to 
   go running back to Dillon. Gay couple Ricky (David Rivera) and Mendel 
   (Jeremy Ebenstein) run into Jack, who throws Barbie's decapitated 
   head at them and then throws an axe, which lands in the middle of 
   Mendel's face (a really nasty scene). Briget can't find Dillon, but 
   Jack finds her, knocking her out. In a WTF?!? moment, we then see 
   Bridget running away from Jack (I got the feeling that the filmmakers 
   forget to film a scene explaining how she was knocked out and then is 
   shown running away). She hides in a hole in a wall, but Jack finds 
   her and ties her to a boiler pipe in the basement. She calls Jack a 
   &quot;coward&quot; and dares him to take off his helmet, but all he 
   does is lift his visor a little to show us his chin and mouth, and he 
   walks away without touching her (I was hoping that Bridget was 
   actually the girl that dumped Jack when he returned from Afghanistan, 
   but this film doesn't have those lofty ambitions). Ricky makes it to 
   the hospital's chapel and starts to pray, only for Jack to appear and 
   burn him to a crisp with a flame-thrower (In the immortal words of 
   the despicable late Fred Phelps and his Westboro Church: &quot;God 
   hates fags.&quot;). Dillon, Earl and Stella finally wake up from 
   their naps (the fact that they were sleeping at all is beyond belief) 
   and go searching for the missing Bridget, paintguns in hand as if 
   those weapons will stop the menace. Earl and Stella make it outside, 
   only to discover all the cars had the wires pulled from under the 
   hood and the main gate is padlocked. They are trapped in the hospital 
   or, as Earl says, &quot;It's too late. We are trapped in our own 
   game!&quot; (or, they could have acted like normal human beings by 
   climbing the fence and alerting the proper authorities). Dillon goes 
   out looking on his own (not one slasher film clich&eacute; is 
   overlooked) and finds a room full of his friends' decapitated heads 
   (It's obvious that holes were cut in cardboard boxes for the actors 
   to stick their heads through. Hell, if you look close enough, you 
   will see some of the heads move!). Dillon finds Bridget tied to a 
   table (after we are earlier led to believe that she was escaping her 
   bonds in the boiler room), but Jack comes after him with a portable 
   circular saw after his drill's battery runs out of juice. After 
   cutting Dillon a couple of times with the saw, Earl and Stella enter 
   the room and push Jack into some acetylene cylinders with a metal 
   cart. His saw causes a spark which sets off the tanks and an 
   explosion occurs (cue the CGI explosion!). They all save Bridget and 
   Dillon fixes one of the cars. They crash through the gate, but like 
   all lousy slasher flicks, we see Jack crawl out of the smoke-filled 
   room to walk the streets once again, hoping this film will be 
   successful enough for a sequel (God, I hope not!). The closing 
   credits try to keeps this awful film socially relevant by showing the 
   homeless living on the streets (while some sappy ballad plays on the 
   soundtrack) and then give us <A HREF="hazard_jack_2013b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hazard jack advance poster10 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="196" HEIGHT="290" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>an

   While there is plenty of nudity, simulated sex (lots of oral sex for 
   some reason) and bloody gore, this is the type of slasher film that 
   no matter how fast a victim runs away, the lumbering killer always 
   catches up and dispatches them. This is like hundreds of DTV slasher 
   films, except for making the main protagonist a soldier who returned 
   home after serving his country a broken man. That premise just left a 
   bad taste in my mouth and if you know someone that served in the 
   military, it's bound to leave a bad taste in your mouth, too. Besides 
   the usual cast of clich&eacute;d characters (the nerd, the lesbian, 
   the gay couple, the bimbo airheads, the muscleheads, the amateur 
   filmmaker who name-drops other horror films and his horny girlfriend, 
   and the good girl and guy), there are some interesting kills in the 
   film (especially the two headless corpses still having sex), most of 
   them using practical effects, and the cast, for the most part, does 
   the best they can with their underwritten characters. There are 
   plenty of plot holes in the film (especially Bridget being knocked 
   out and then being seen running away), which would account for the 
   film's short 81 minute running time. David Worth was also 
   cinematographer here (although in the end credits, it lists &quot;Mark
    Lester&quot; [not that Mark Lester] as Director of Photography), 
   which accounts for the film looking so good (he shot the Clint 
   Eastwood film <B><A HREF="any_which_way_you_can_1980.htm">ANY WHICH 
   WAY YOU CAN</A></B> - 1980) and he also directed and photographed 
   porn films under the pseudonym &quot;Sven Conrad&quot;. Producer

   was actually a woman, truth be told, I was taken aback a little bit. 
   Not because this is a bad film, but because there is not one bit of 
   feminism in this slasher film. As a matter of fact, two of the main 
   actresses' characters are real pain in the asses. The film opens with 
   two young women trapped in a hotel with a psycho chasing them. One of 
   the girls stabs the psycho and he shoots her dead. The psycho points 
   the gun at the other woman and says, &quot;Are you scared?&quot;. It 
   all turns out to be a prank played by the dead girl on the living one 
   on a TV show called &quot;Scary Antics&quot; hosted by David (Todd 
   Bruno), also known as &quot;Scary Dave&quot; and their regular psycho 
   player is Tim (Mario Nalini). The show is in trouble of getting 
   cancelled if the ratings don't improve, so David makes the pranks 
   being pulled meaner and meaner, which upsets makeup<A HREF="hazmat_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hazmat 2013 poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   person/special effects artist Brenda (Aneila McGuinness), who also 
   happens to be in love with David. Their next episode is set up by 
   Adam (Reggie Peters). His friend Jacob (Norbert Velez) is getting 
   weirder and weirder, so much so, that his nickname is now &quot;Creepy
    Jacob&quot;, so David wants to shock him back into reality. Also in 
   on the joke are Carla (Daniela Larez) and Melanie (Gema Galero), who 
   are really doing this for the TV exposure, hoping to turn their 
   appearances into show business jobs (How many real-life reality stars 
   have done the same thing and failed miserably? Some even committing 
   suicide because their dreams didn't come true?). Adam picks an old 
   warehouse, where there was a deadly fire years ago that killed many 
   people and now it is said to be haunted, but it seems Jacob knows 
   everything about it because his father worked there (More on that 
   later.). Something tells me that this practical joke is going to go 
   very, very wrong, especially since most psychiatrists would diagnose 
   Jacob as being emotionally unhinged. The foursome enter the warehouse 
   after David and his crew have set up the internet and hidden cameras 
   (their budget is so low, they are only able to rig the front half of 
   the warehouse, so everything in the back of the warehouse is not 
   covered) and Jacob heads directly for the office, which is the 
   Control Room for David and his team. The walls are thick and a big 
   metal bar slides across the metal door, so it is impossible to get in 
   unless you are let in. If Jacob were strong enough to break down that 
   door, the joke would be blown and the episode scrapped, which would 
   mean certain cancellation, so Adam talks him out of it and they all 
   go exploring. Jacob use to spend a lot of time at the warehouse when 
   he was a kid, so he and Adam go off together, while the two girls are 
   left on their own. Jacob tells Adam that his late father once worked 
   here and he believed the place was haunted. Jacob says his father 
   once saw a man's skin dissolve off his body, but when the police 
   arrived, the man was dead, but he had all his skin (Is it possible 
   that Jacob's father was a murderer?). Adam is disgusted by the story 
   and tells Jacob that he is losing touch with reality before he walks 
   away. Jacob finds a white hazmat suit in a locker and puts it on, 
   which scares the hell out of Adam. You see, Tim is supposed to appear 
   in the very same type of hazmat suit and &quot;kill&quot; Adam. Tim 
   puts on the suit and Adam screams (part of the joke). When Jacob and 
   the two girls find Adam, he is bloody and &quot;dead&quot; (also part 
   of the joke). Jacob and the two girls run in different directions 
   and, so far, the practical joke is going perfectly. Both girls scream 
   in different directions, leaving Jacob to decide which way to go 
   (again, still part of the joke). Tim comes behind Jacob in his white 
   hazmat suit and gets a fire axe planted in his stomach (definitely 
   not part of the joke). David and his crew witness the whole thing 
   from the Control Room and Jacob disappears from the hidden cameras by 
   going to the back of the warehouse. Adam and the two girls have no 
   idea what is going on, so David leaves the Control Room to warn them 
   and to also tell Jacob that this was all a practical joke. It seems 
   Jacob has picked up some of his dead father's bad habits, though, as 
   he kills Adam with the axe to his stomach when he sees he's really 
   alive. Everyone in the Control Room know that everything that happens 
   is now their fault. Jacob, dressed in a bloody white hazmat suit and 
   gasmask, begins destroying all the cameras he can see, which limits 
   what the Control Room can see (Steven [Tom Stedman] says, &quot;I 
   think he knows he's on the show!&quot;). David finds Adam's dead body 
   and is nearly killed by Jacob, but he ducks Jacob's axe swing and 
   barely makes it back to the safety of the Control Room. One of their 
   technicians, Gary (Geordan Deaz), is still outside the Control Room, 
   so David tries to radio him to call the police, but the thick walls 
   and metal door garbles the transmission and Gary makes it to the 
   Control Room (Of course, David made everyone leave their cell phones 
   in the van so there would not be any interruptions). Carla and 
   Melanie discover Tim's dead body and realize the joke is over (but 
   only after kicking his dead body a few times!). Jacob appears behind 
   them and plants the axe in Carla's back, as Melanie runs towards the 
   Control Room. David doesn't want to let her in, but level-headed 
   Brenda opens the door and lets her in just in time. Ed (Dennis 
   Spain), one of the show's techs, returns to the warehouse to pick up 
   the equipment (the show should have been long over), but Jacob pulls 
   him into the building and chops off one of his arms. Ed and Jacob 
   appear at the Control Room door and Ed says Jacob will kill him in 30 
   seconds if they don't let him in. Needless to say, Ed ends up with an 
   axe blade implanted in his stomach. David and Steven sneak out of the 
   Control Room to find the back door (the map is on Tim's dead body), 
   but Jacob finds them and Steven ends <A HREF="hazmat_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hazmat 2013 poster6 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>up
    with the axe planted in his skull. David tells Brenda (via helmet 
   camera) that he loves her and he makes it to the back door, only to 
   be pulled back in by Jacob and we see David's decapitated head fall 
   to the ground. Jacob kicks David's head back into the warehouse and 
   closes the back door. The last three left, Brenda, Gary and Melinda, 
   leave the safety of the Control Room to get out the front door, but 
   Jacob has made it impossible to open. They head back to the Control 
   Room and find another exit on the map. Brenda leaves to see if it is 
   open. Alas, it isn't, so Jacob chases her back to the Control Room, 
   only they aren't able to close the door in time and Jacob gets in. He 
   impales one of Gary's eyes with the pointy end of the fire axe, while 
   Brenda and Melanie run for their lives. Melanie is killed when she 
   has one of her arms cut off while holding hands with Brenda as they 
   are running away and Brenda is choked and lifted off the ground by 
   her neck while Jacob reaches for the axe, which is propped against a 
   wall. The axe falls to the ground and Brenda is able to break free. 
   She is able to make it to the door and outside, but then she is 
   pulled back in and the film ends with the screen turning red.&nbsp; I 
   could have thought of a better ending with my eyes closed (How about 
   the whole thing was a huge practical joke on Brenda for wanting to 
   leave the network?), but director Lou Simon apparently ran out of 
   ideas with her screenplay (my suggestion would have worked perfectly) 
   and gave us the cop-out ending, leaving it wide open for a sequel, 
   but for a slasher film (also known as <B><A HREF="hazard_2013.htm">HAZARD</A></B>),
    it's not that bad. It's a mixture of &quot;found footage&quot; and 
   normal filmmaking, but since all the cameras are basically 
   stationary, it didn't hurt the story (it still had that sickly green 
   night-vision that I hate with a passion). This is slightly 
   above-average for a slasher film, but would have been so much better 
   if Jacob used various weapons, not just an axe. While there is 
   extreme gore on view, some of it goes by so fast that you have to 
   pause the disc (or your streaming service) to see it better. I get 
   the feeling that Ms. Simon was trying to create a new horror icon 
   here and it would have worked if we didn't see his normal human face 
   and if he had above-average powers (although he did a good job 
   lifting Brenda in the air by her throat). It's apparent that Jacob 
   has a few screws loose, but there's nothing here that puts him in the 
   same class as Michael, Jason or Freddy. It works perfectly as a 
   slasher film (using a reality show as a backdrop is old hat by now, 
   though) and it would be interesting to see what direction it would 
   take in a sequel, but give him more than an axe to work with the next 
   time. All technical levels of the film are above-average and so is 
   the acting by a cast of relative unknowns, but it could have been 
   much, much better if Jacob was given more to work with besides an 
   axe. Everyone is talking about the Soska Sisters, but this film is 
   better than most of their films. People should start talking about 
   Lou Simon. Made in Miami, Florida. Also featuring Brandi Rudicil and 
   Massiel Checo as the two women in the beginning of the film. An <A HREF="http://www.uncorkedentertainment.com">Uncork'd

   (2006) -</B> More Canadian Tax Credit DTV horror crap. Satanic serial 
   killer Jonathan Chambers (James Binkley) is executed in the electric 
   chair and his death is witnessed by Sheriff Berger (Robert Englund, 
   the crowned king of DTV crud), who captured him, and Dr. Hitchens 
   (Michael Cram), whose interest in serial killers goes way beyond what 
   we would consider professional. It's apparent that Chambers' 
   execution is also anything but professional, as the electric chair is 
   struck by lightning (!) and Chambers' face is horribly burned. While 
   Sheriff Berger and Dr. Hitchens are transporting Chambers' body to 
   the local hospital for an autopsy, they hit suicidal teen Sara Wexler 
   (Meredith Henderson), who is sitting in the middle of the road with 
   her back turned to traffic (she's despondent over her fellow students 
   calling her &quot;Slut&quot;!). They put the injured Sara into the 
   same ambulance as Chambers' corpse (really?) and she witnesses his <A HREF="heartstopper_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/heartstopper 2006 dvd front (unrated edition) small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="182" HEIGHT="264" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>hands
    move, but she can't get anyone to believe her, including her 
   insensitive mother (Lori Hallier), who seems more disturbed about 
   driving to the hospital during a raging thunderstorm than her 
   daughter's condition (She's a bitch with a capital &quot;C&quot;). 
   While Dr. Hitchens is performing an autopsy on Chambers, he notices a 
   cyst over Chambers' eye that is oozing yellow puss, so he takes a 
   sample for analysis. Unfortunately, Dr. Hitchens will never get the 
   chance, because Chambers comes to life and rips-out the good doctor's 
   heart with his bare hands (his signature move when he was alive). 
   Chambers then stalks the hospital looking for Sara (they have some 
   as-yet unknown bond), killing everyone else who he comes in contact 
   with, including Sara's mother (he sets her face on fire with a 
   cigarette lighter in a laughable CGI effect), Sheriff Berger (who is 
   shocked with a defibrillator, followed by a manual heart removal) and 
   an entire E.R. room full of staff, patients and visitors. Sara, along 
   with fellow student Walter (Nathan Stephenson) and Nurse Grafton 
   (Laura De Carteret), spend the rest of the film trying to avoid 
   Chambers, as the hospital is running on emergency power, the phone 
   lines are down and all the roads are flooded due to the storm. Need I 
   say more?&nbsp; This ridiculously cheap horror film, directed by Bob 
   Keen (<B><A HREF="to_catch_a_yeti_1995.htm">TO CATCH A YETI</A></B> - 
   1994; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Proteus1995">PROTEUS</A></B> - 
   1995), who is better known for his effects work than his directorial 
   skills, is a stereotypical stalk 'n' slash horror flick that delivers 
   some decent unrated gore effects (various heart-rippings; a patient 
   having his chest ripped open until his ribs and internal organs are 
   exposed; a scalpel in the eye; a face slashing), but the storyline 
   (screenplay by Vlady Pildysh and Warren P. Sonoda) is generic to the 
   point of being tiresome. The majority of the film is Sara running 
   through the hospital corridors, while Chambers, who may be possessed 
   by the Devil himself (or &quot;Dark Lord&quot; as Chambers calls 
   him), tries to capture her and take over her body (who better than a 
   suicidal teen, right?). This is the type of film where the villain 
   spouts sarcastic remarks while dispatching his victims and everyone 
   else does the most illogical things possible at the most inopportune 
   times just to advance the plot. Most annoying is Nurse Grafton, who 
   at first is understanding and kind to Sara when she is first 
   admitted, but once the shit starts to hit the fan, she turns into a 
   quivering jackass who tells Walter that Sara has &quot;abandoned 
   them&quot; when she is actually risking her life to find blood so she 
   can give Walter a much-needed transfusion. Nothing here makes very 
   much sense and the film just plods along to its inevitable crappy 
   conclusion (ready-made for a sequel). <B><A HREF="heartstopper_2006b.htm">HEARTSTOPPER</A></B>

   Ridiculously horrible creature feature which made its premiere on the 
   SyFy Network (but is not one of their Original Films, even though the 
   streaming print that I viewed on my Roku 3 streaming player has 
   fade-outs to show where commercial breaks should be inserted) that 
   asks more questions than it answers and has the most 
   horrendously-rendered CGI monster I can ever recall seeing. The story 
   is simple: Gold-loving Billy Butler (an over-acting Michael 
   Badalucco; <B><A HREF="summer_of_sam_1999.htm">SUMMER OF SAM</A></B> 
   - 1999) re-opens his ancestor William Butler's gold mine, where in 
   1840, five Chinese slave labor workers died in a cave-in. A Chinese 
   witch created a &quot;Five Heads Beast&quot; (one head for each of 
   the dead cave-in victims) that haunts the mines, killing anyone who 
   dares look for gold. Back in the modern day, two men sneak into the 
   mine looking for gold, only to set free the lumbering beast, which 
   has fives heads, eats gold, has a stomach full of sharp teeth, emits 
   a paralyzing gas so it can kill its victims easier (usually by 
   turning their heads 360 degrees and ripping the flesh from their 
   faces) and bleeds gold when it is injured! When the creature begins 
   killing the town's citizens, police officer Todd Crane (Robert 
   Belushi, the son of James <A HREF="heebie_jeebies_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/heebie jeebies 2013 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="286" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Belushi
    and nephew of the late Jim Belushi), who suffers severe headaches 
   and panic attacks whenever he is put in a stressful situation (Which 
   brings up the film's biggest unanswered question: Why would he become 
   a police officer when it is one of the world's most stressful jobs?), 
   Sheriff Tatum (Carl Savering) and town coroner Teresa Lim (Cathy 
   Shim), who is helping Todd cope with his condition using ancient 
   Chinese methods, try to find out just who or what is committing these 
   brutal killings. The first to be killed (after the two illegal 
   miners) is Federal Mine Inspector Eve Moore (Jennifer Rubin; <B><A HREF="bad_dreams_1988.htm">BAD
    DREAMS</A></B> - 1988, who is given second billing, but is in the 
   film for less than five minutes), who takes a bribe in gold from 
   Billy Butler to look the other way because he is illegally using 
   explosives, crashes her SUV when she spots the creature and is then 
   killed by the creature, who eats all her ill-gotten gold just before 
   her car blows up (more bad CGI). Todd's sister Veronica (Evie 
   Thompson), her boyfriend (and Sheriff Tatum's son) Mace (Dave Davis), 
   best friend (and Teresa's sister; this is a small town) Tracey 
   (Olivia Ku) and her boyfriend Rick (Tyler Forrest) decide to sneak 
   out to the mine to spend a night drinking beer and having sex, even 
   though Todd tells Veronica to stay inside (He looks after her since 
   the death of their parents) and Tracey's Chinese-speaking mother Zu 
   Mu (Lucille Soong) forbids her to leave the house. The second to die 
   is crotchety old Agnes Whitehead (Marion Ross of <B><A HREF="happy_days_tv_series_1974-1984.htm">HAPPY
    DAYS</A></B> [1974 - 1984], who is the best thing about this film), 
   who lets her dog outside to take a shit (She says to her dog, 
   &quot;Pinch it off and come inside!&quot;, the comedy highlight of 
   the film) and is attacked by the creature, who kills her and then 
   steals the newly-installed gold fillings in her teeth! While Billy 
   Butler is making one of his many TV commercials (He's one of those 
   &quot;Send me your gold for money&quot; kind of guys), he witnesses 
   the entire commercial crew getting slaughtered by the creature, but 
   he is impervious to the creature's paralyzing gas. When he sees that 
   the creature bleeds gold, Billy comes up with a plan to capture, not 
   kill, it, because (as he explains to the Sheriff, who he has 
   handcuffed to the back seat of his own patrol car) &quot;You don't 
   kill the goose who lays the golden eggs.&quot; Todd and Theresa try 
   to save Veronica, Tracey and their boyfriends when Zu Mu (who could 
   speak English all along) tells Todd the history of the mine, but the 
   Sheriff has already sent a party of hunters to track down the 
   creature and kill it. After the creature makes a hasty meal of the 
   hunters, Billy Butler kidnaps Theresa and brings her inside the mine 
   as bait for the creature. Will Todd get over his panic attacks in 
   time to save his love Theresa and the others? What the hell do you 
   think?&nbsp; This is just plain bad from the first minute.

   cocktail napkin, as it is full of stock characters and situations we 
   have seen in hundreds of horror films before it. Director Thomas L. 
   Callaway, a cinematographer by trade (his first film as photographer

   any by making the film move slower than a snail walking across 
   molasses and the carnage, what there is of it, is mainly CGI blood 
   spewing across the screen while the camera shakes wildly (every once 
   in a while we do see practical effects like a human eyeball being 
   squeezed through a chain link fence), only showing us the results of 
   the creature's attacks after the fact (which is mainly bloody faces). 
   The creature itself is the main distraction, though. It's an 
   incredibly phoney-looking combination of mutated heads attached to a 
   body that couldn't possibly move as fast as it does on-screen. When 
   you watch it eating bars of gold, I dare you not to laugh. Do 
   yourself a favor and just take my word for it. There is no reason for 
   you to even bother watching this film unless you are a bad film

   (1990) -</B> In 1969, a secret government project called the Nietzche 
   Experiment is being run at a private college by Dr. Jones (John 
   Saxon), where he has invented a superman drug that is supposed to 
   increase psychic abilities of anyone who is injected with it. 
   Unfortunately, it also caused many people to mutate and the many 
   college students injected with it died and Dr. Jones mysteriously 
   disappeared and the whole thing was covered up by the government. 
   Twenty years later, Professor Damon (Robert Dole) restarts the 
   experiments on a new batch of college students. One student, Shelly 
   O'Deane (Amy Raasch), begins to have visions of a mysterious man in 
   the campus chapel. That man is Robert (<B><A HREF="dawn_of_the_dead_1978.htm">DAWN

   causing them to become deformed and psychotic and all but four of 
   them died. That man turns out to be Dr. Jones (he's been perfecting

    to stop Robert from investigating further, he has devoted his life 
   to tracking down Dr. Jones and putting a stop to his experiment once 
   and for all. Robert has tracked him back to the college where it all 
   began. There's also another problem that has come to the college: The 
   four vagrants (which Dr. Jones has adopted as his &quot;family&quot;) 
   that survived &quot;The Reward&quot; have arrived at the college in a 
   strange religious-themed school bus and begin killing the students, 
   teachers and workers, including Shelly's brother Adam (Todd Tesen), a 
   campus security guard. Pretty soon, the entire Jones clan, all 
   hideously deformed, begin stalking the campus, killing some people 
   and injecting others with the serum. Kelly and her best friend Jesse 
   (Jeff Rector), a disabled student, try to stay one step ahead of Dr. 
   Jones and his clan. Shelly's psychic abilities come in handy, but 
   they will need Robert's help, too. Armed with a crossbow that shoots 
   undiluted serum (which causes those already infected to dissolve into 
   a pile of goo), Robert works his way through the Jones family tree, 
   while Shelly and her friends try to beat a hasty retreat. It all ends 
   in the campus chapel, the same location where it ended in 1969, as 
   Shelly finds the secret underground tunnels beneath the chapel and 
   faces off with Dr. Jones, who wants Shelly to join his family because

   minutes shorter than this version). It's obvious that scenes have 
   been re-shuffled and shown out of order (probably to alleviate the 
   lagging pace), but all it does is increase the &quot;Huh?&quot; 
   factor, as you'll be scratching your head wondering what the hell is 
   going on. There are plenty of decent makeup effects, including face 
   meltings, impalements and the horrendous faces of the entire Jones 
   clan (Stooges guitarist Ron Asheton plays the nun, &quot;Mama 
   Jones&quot;), but the storyline makes very little sense and John 
   Saxon (in what amounts to an extended cameo) overacts terribly while 
   spouting some of the gamiest dialogue your ears will ever hear 
   (&quot;If I can make them, I can make God!&quot;). My favorite line 
   comes from Jesse, when he is chastising a girl who has just seen her 
   boyfriend melt after having a drum of medical waste dumped on him. 
   When she refuses Jesse's advances, he says to her, &quot;My handicap 
   was born. Yours was chosen!&quot; Unbelievable! <B><A HREF="hellmaster_1990b.htm">HELLMASTER</A></B>

    A leak in a facility called &quot;The Hope Center&quot; (an

   anthropoligist and reporter Lia Rousseau (Margit Evelyn Newton; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#FinalExecutioner">THE
    FINAL EXECUTIONER</A></B> - 1983) is fretting over a young boy, who 
   was bitten by one of the infected. They stop at a jungle village to 
   get some fresh water, when they are attacked by zombies. Lia and her 
   documentary cameraman, Mack Osborne (Luis Fonoll), run into Mike and 
   his men (no explanation on why they are there) and rush back to 
   father Pierre (Gaby Renom), whom Lia discovers is being eaten in 
   their Land Rover by his son (!) Mike has one of his men kill the 
   young zombie by shooting him in the head (&quot;These mothers have 
   more lives than a cat!&quot;). Lia hitches a ride with Mike and when 
   he doesn't like the sound of native drums coming from jungle, Lia 
   strips naked, paints her nipples white (!) and goes it alone in the 
   jungle to see what the natives are up to (She lived with the natives 
   for over a year and, like most Italian jungle films from this period, 
   we see the natives butchering a live animal). Lia is able to find out

   Mike's Jeep breaks down, they are forced to take Lia's Land Rover, 
   throwing a year's worth of documentary footage away so&nbsp; his men 
   can fit in, which leads to an indescribable scene of pure stupidity 
   (you have to see it!). In another scene that screams WTF?!?, SWAT 
   member Zantoro (Frank Garfield; real name: Franco Garofalo; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Eyes Behind Stars">THE

    We are then at the U.N. building, where one representative of New 
   Guinea puts down the United States for allowing this virus to be 
   released in his country (intercut with stock footage that has nothing 
   to do with New Guinea). Lia, Mike and the ragtag group of SWAT 
   members come upon the dilapidated ruins of a jungle mansion, where 
   Mike finds the dead body of an elderly white woman. When he touches 
   her body, a zombie cat bursts out of her stomach and it is not long 
   before the mansion is crawling with zombies. The living dead kill one 
   member of the SWAT team (Zantoro says, &quot;They're eating him like 
   pigs!&quot;) and they escape in the Land Rover, but not before 
   Zantoro (who seems to be infected with a form of the virus, which 
   makes him cackle like some idiot) once again walks into the middle of 
   a group of zombies and sets them on fire with a torch (He says to the 
   zombies, &quot;Sorry, guys, it looks like I'm not on the menu!&quot;).
    Mike makes it to the ocean shore, where he and his SWAT team take a 
   rubber raft to The Hope Center and we learn what his mission is: To 
   kill anyone still left alive so none of this will be made public (it 
   doesn't make any sense, especially if you take the U.N. scene into 
   consideration). Who will be left and what will be left of them? HINT: 
   No one lives, as Lia has her tongue ripped-out by a zombified 
   Zantoro, who then shoves his arm so far up her mouth that her eyes 
   pop out of their sockets! The film ends with the rest of the world 
   hearing the story on an emergency broadcast, but none of them believe 
   it. They soon will, as we<A HREF="night_of_the_zombies_1980.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/night of the zombies poster10 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>

    This boring, yet gory, Italy/Spain co-production can only be enjoyed 
   for its unbelievable dialogue and sound effects. The stock footage 
   shows animals which couldn't possibly live in New Guinea and I dare 
   you not to laugh when they show a flock of flamingos who cackle like 
   turkeys! While most of the actors are dubbed (and it sounds like the 
   dubbing artists, including Ted Rusoff, were having a good time 
   improvising their dialogue, including the line of dialogue that opens

   when her boss Charles Richmond (the unfortunately named Simon Kunz) 
   pulls her in his office and has her watch a videotape he has just 
   received. It shows a secret group called the &quot;Deaders&quot;, led 
   by the charismatic Winter (Paul Rhys), bringing a woman name Marla 
   (Georgina Rylance) back to life after she commits suicide by shooting 
   herself in the head. Charles wants Amy to run with the story, but all 
   he has is Marla's address in Bucharest, Romania (where this movie was 
   filmed). Amy heads for Bucharest and goes to Marla's apartment (she 
   slips the superintendent a couple of twenties to let her in), only to 
   find Marla dead in the bathroon, her eyes whiter than snow, insects 
   crawling out of her mouth and a cord tied around her neck. There is 
   an envelope with the words &quot;Help Us&quot; written on it and 
   Marla is holding the dreaded Lament Configuration box in one of her 
   rigored hands. Amy grabs the envelope and the box, only for Marla to 
   seemingly come back to life for a few seconds and scare the shit out 
   of Amy. Back at the hotel, Amy opens the envelope to find a VHS tape 
   and a key. She plays the tape, where Marla tells whomever is watching 
   it to please help her and other members of the Deaders cult and to 
   talk to Joey (Marc Warren), who has commandeered the last subway car 
   on one of the subway lines, because he knows where the Deaders 
   compound is located. Amy also plays with the Lament Configuration box 
   and accidentally opens it. Suddenly, large chains come flying out of 
   the box and wrap themselves around her head and Pinhead appears, 
   telling Amy her soul is now his, but she still has work to do. From 
   that point on, Amy's life becomes a living nightmare, where she is 
   unable to distinguish what is real and what is fantasy (Amy is 
   already a troubled girl, as she frequently has flashbacks to her 
   childhood, where her father constantly beat her with his belt, locked 
   her in a closet and may have even sexually abused her.). She hops on 
   the subway car to meet Joey (the car is quite the sight, as the 
   windows are covered with newspapers and naked women and men gyrate in 
   various sexual positions, some even being tortured). Joey tells her 
   the location of the Deaders compound, but also tells her if she knows 
   what is good for her, she should head back to London immediately (He 
   says to her, &quot;We're all just pieces in Winter's puzzle.&quot;). 
   Amy doesn't take his advice and goes to the Deaders compound, only to 
   find the gate chained with a padlock. Remembering the key in the 
   envelope, she uses it to open the padlock to enter the compound. She 
   begins to explore the labyrinth of hallways in the compound, which 
   seem to get tighter and tighter as she progresses (a really 
   atmospheric sequence, with a jump-scare that deals with a lighter and 
   a wall full of bugs), getting so tight, in fact, that she is unable 
   to progress any further. Suddenly an arm with a knife appears behind 
   her and she suddenly wakes up in the same room she saw on the first 
   videotape, with Winter and his followers looking down at her while 
   she lies on a bed. Winters wants her to stab herself so he can bring 
   her back to life, but she refuses, so Winters goes to stab her. She 
   then suddenly wakes up in a mental institution, restrained to a bed 
   with Charles beside her saying that he is working on getting her 
   released. The doctor removes her restraints and she walks around the 
   institution, where a little girl offers to draw her picture. When Amy 
   sees the finished product, half her face is normal and half is 
   monstrously decayed. She then wakes up in her hotel room, where she 
   discovers that she has been stabbed in the back with a butcher knife, 
   the blade protruding from her stomach, but she feels no pain even 
   though she is bleeding profusely (She can't reach the knife to pull 
   it out, so she uses a cabinet door in the bathroon to hold the 
   knife's handle while she pulls away. This sequence is almost too hard 
   to watch.). She then heads back to the subway car to talk to Joey, 
   only to find him and the rest of the crew dead, looking the same way 
   Marla did in her bathroom (If you look closely, you can spot a couple 
   of Cenobites playing with the corpses). In the finale, Amy ends up 
   back in the Deaders' suicide room, with Winter wanting Amy to open 
   the Lament Configuration box. She refuses and throws the box to the 
   floor, where it opens by itself. Pinhead and a couple of Cenobites 
   appear and Pinhead is pissed because Winter is messing around in his 
   territory, taking human souls for himself. Like any good Cenobite, 
   Pinhead has chains with hooks shoot out of the walls&nbsp; and pierce 
   Winter's body, graphically tearing him apart limb-from-limb. <A HREF="hellraiser_deader_2003.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hellraiser deader dutch dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="176" HEIGHT="251" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Pinhead
    has two other huge chains shoot out of the walls to run through the 
   midsections of Winter's followers, leaving large gaping holes in 
   their stomachs before they die. Pinhead then switches his attention 
   to Amy, saying it is now time for her to give him her soul. We then 
   flashback to Amy's childhood and find out that when she was a little 
   girl, she stabbed her father to death for all his abuse. Amy then 
   looks at Pinhead, tells him he will never get her soul and then 
   commits suicide by stabbing herself in the stomach. Pinhead screams, 
   as he and the other Cenobites disappear in a flash of bright light. 
   The film closes with Charles bringing a new wet-behind-the-ears 
   female reporter into his office, telling her he has a tape he wants 
   her to watch. And so, the cycle continues. While not a barn-burner, 
   this film is better than most sequels (most of the <B><A HREF="hellraiser_2_hellbound_1988.htm">HELLRAISER</A></B> <A HREF="hellraiser_3_hell_on_earth_1992.htm">sequels</A>

   supplied by Gary Tunnicliffe (who was also Second Unit Director) and 
   his crew and lots of nudity (Yes, you do get to see Kari Wuhrer

   camera on a tripod that makes him see Cenobites torturing him live on 
   a monitor. The police are nearly ready to arrest him for the murder 
   of his wife when they find out that he stands to inherit a vast 
   amount of money from her estate (a reference to the first film is 
   made here, since Laurence is playing the same role she did in that 
   film). Trevor keeps alternating between two worlds, both which make 
   no sense to him. When the final coda is revealed it is a doozy, so I 
   will not spoil it for you here. Suffice to say, all the piece of the 
   puzzle fit together quite nicely. Directed with flair by 
   cinematographer Rick Bota, who must have impressed the bigshots at 
   Dimension Films as they hired him to direct two more films for the 
   series: <B><A HREF="#HellraiserDeader03">HELLRAISER: DEADER</A></B> 
   and <B><A HREF="#HellraiserHWorld03">HELLRAISER: HELLWORLD</A></B> 
   (both filmed back-to-back in Romania in 2003, to be released in 
   2005). Pinhead and the Cenobites are used sparingly here, mainly to 
   good effect. There are a few gory scenes, including an icepick to the 
   head, the aforementioned needle through the neck, a suicide by 
   gunshot from the chin through the brain and various Cenobite 
   violence, including the prerequisite chains and hooks. Not bad for a <B><A HREF="hellraiser_2_hellbound_1988.htm">HELLRAISER</A></B>

    are called by Chelsea (Katheryn Winnick) and told to look at a 
   certain window of the house to see her, all the cops can see is an 
   empty window. Every once in a while Pinhead (Doug Bradley) and his 
   Cenobites show up to kill a main character and I'm glad to report 
   that the blood and gore flows rather freely. When the only game 
   players that are left are Chelsea and her semi-boyfriend Jake 
   (Christopher Jacot), The Host plays his hand and tells them that they 
   have been drugged from the beginning and buried alive (with plastic 
   tubing as breathing airholes) with only their cellphones as 
   companions, letting their imaginations, some deft instructions from 
   The Host through the cellphones and Hellworld to destroy themselves. 
   It seems that everyone else that was buried alive are now dead at 
   their own hands (scared to death, asthma, tearing one's throat apart) 
   and only Chelsea and Jake are still buried alive, but alive. Why has 
   The Host done all this? Well, it seems that his son, Adam (Stelian 
   Urian), who invented Hellworld, committed suicide after opening the 
   Lament Configuration box and he blames all the other players, who 
   were his friends, for his son's death (Seems like The Host never even 
   went to his son's funeral.). The police arrive just in time to save 
   Chelsea and Jake, but The Host gets away, hiding out in a 
   roach-infested motel. Inside his briefcase is the Lament 
   Configuration box and he fools around with it. Big mistake. The box 
   opens and Pinhead and his Cenobites appear. One of the Cenobites cuts 
   The Host into three pieces with what looks like a giant axehead 
   attached to a metal chain (one of the film's gory highlights) and The 
   Host appears one more time in the car of Chelsea and Jake to remind 
   them that he will always be with them. I'm not saying that this is a 
   great film, but it is an enjoyable extension of the <B><A HREF="hellraiser_2_hellbound_1988.htm">HELLRAISER</A></B>

   to make love to his girlfriend Vicky (Catherine Rowlands) by a 
   roaring fireplace, only to be interrupted by the incessant banging of 
   a cane on the wall by Neville's sickly, abusive and wheelchair-bound 
   father, Alfred (Al Greer), who wants to be put to bed. Vicky wonders 
   out loud how much longer Neville will have to endure his father's 
   constant maltreatments (When Neville carries his father to bed, the

   &quot;He'll be dead soon and we can leave this place for good&quot;, 
   to which Vicky replies, &quot;Will we?&quot;. Neville's father is 
   filthy rich and lords his fortune over Neville's head, also calling 
   Vicky a &quot;slut&quot; who only stays with him because one day he 
   will be rich. The next day, Neville has had enough of his father's 
   verbal and mental abuse, leaving him in his wheelchair on a rocky ro<A HREF="hereafter_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hereafter vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="164" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ad.
    The brakes give out on the wheelchair and good old Dad rolls off a 
   cliff, lands in a lake and dies. Neville is finally free and believes 
   he can now sell his father's mansion and sawmill business for a 
   million pounds, but at the reading of the will, Daddy gets his 
   revenge by stating that Neville must live in the mansion for at least 
   eleven months of the year or else the mansion and the sawmill will be 
   given to charity. Neville and Vicky get married and move into the 
   mansion and Vicky discovers that the house holds some deadly secrets 
   of its own. There's a room in the mansion that Neville keeps locked 
   and he explains to Vicky that his great-great uncle committed suicide 
   in that room (by flinging himself through the window) after watching 
   his commoner girlfriend being gang-raped and drowned by men hired by 
   his uncle's disapproving father. Neville was accidentally locked in 
   that room as a small child and swears he saw the ghosts of his 
   great-great uncle and his girlfriend, which is why he keeps the room 
   locked. Vicky thinks this is all a steaming pile of bunk, so she 
   orders housekeeper Dorothy (Wendy Young) to open the room. Vicky also 
   throws a costume party and has her friend Sylvia (Yvette Gunter) hold 
   a s&eacute;ance. At the s&eacute;ance, Sylvia becomes possessed by 
   Neville's father and soon Neville begins seeing the rotting corpse of 
   his father at the most inopportune times. The question soon becomes: 
   Is Neville actually seeing ghosts or is someone trying to kill him? 
   If it is the latter, who can it be? Karate-loving groundskeeper 
   Patrick (David Slater)? Housekeeper Dorothy? Devoted wife Sally? Or 
   could it be a combination of any two? When Neville takes a header out 
   the window of the once-locked room and nearly dies and the guilty 
   parties exposed to the audience, a now-paraplegic and 
   wheelchair-bound Neville (Oh, do you see the irony?) plays a cat-and-mouse
    game with the guilty parties after discovering the treachery, 
   setting a plan into motion that proves deadly for everyone 
   involved.&nbsp; If you ever had the (dis)pleasure of watching a 
   Michael J. Murphy film (he directed and wrote this one using the 
   pseudonym &quot;Michael Melsack&quot;), you know what to expect here: 
   Static camerawork (with plenty of Dutch angles); extremely cheesy 
   makeup effects (a pickaxe to the eye; the rotting corpse of Neville's 
   father; an arm caught in a bear trap; a bloody stabbing); amateurish 
   acting (Murphy has a stock company of actors, many who appear in most 
   of his films [both Steven Longhurst and Catherine Rowlands also 
   appear in Murphy's <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Bloodstream1985">BLOODSTREAM</A></B>]);
    bad post-synch dubbing; and a droning synthesizer score. That 
   doesn't mean <B>THE HEREAFTER</B> (originally known as <B><A HREF="qualen_1983.htm">QUALEN</A></B>,
    since this film was expressly made for export to Spain!) is 
   unwatchable, though. For some reason, Murphy's films have a nasty 
   edge to them and, in this film, that nastiness comes in Neville's 
   revenge once he figures out he is being played for a fool (and 
   eventual murder victim). Watching Neville dragging his lifeless lower 
   half up a flight of stairs and discovering all the evidence he needs 
   to put the guilty parties in prison is about as creepy as it comes, 
   yet instead of turning them into the authorities, he devises a 
   devious plan of retribution that will have your attention to the 
   bitter end, bad acting aside. This is by no means a good film, but it 
   is an interesting no-budget horror flick for non-discriminating genre 
   fans. Besides that, it's as rare as fuck. The only legitimate English 
   language home video release in the entire world was the U.S. VHS tape

    BREED: THE LEGEND OF SAMHAIN</A></B> [2003]). A group of teenage 
   spelunkers go cave exploring in the middle of the California desert, 
   armed only with a bag of marijuana, some bottles of Jagermeister and 
   their raging hormones. It's not long before they are attacked and 
   graphically killed (one of the girls is cut in half and gets to see 
   the lower half of her body dragged away before she dies) by a tribe 
   of mutant cannibals who speak in a thick Irish brogue. It turns out 
   the leader of the cannibals is good old Sawney Bean himself (how he 
   got to California is never explained) and he's been able to keep his 
   clan going by eating wayward people who stray into their territory 
   and occasionally accepting a new member into the fold, like they do 
   with Ben (Tom Nagle), one of the spelunkers. Only Linda (Heather 
   Conforto), Bill's girlfriend, escapes the clutches of the cannibal 
   clan (thanks to an understanding cannibal member), but when she is 
   picked-up by the Sheriff (Louis Graham), he doesn't believe her story 
   and thinks she's high on drugs (not to mention that she's a teenage 
   runaway reported missing by her parents). Linda escapes from the 
   Sheriff (turns out he works in cahoots with the cannibals) and 
   decides to deal with the situation on her own, so she heads back to 
   the caves, rescues Bill and then are both pursued through the desert 
   by the cannibals. Bill is quickly recaptured and tortured (some of 
   his fingers are cut off with a pair of scissors and eaten in front of 
   him), leaving Linda to join forces with Ted (Chriss Anglin), another 
   survivor who witnessed his family being killed by the cannibals and 
   vowed to get revenge. They both go the the caves and...hell, I can't 
   go on with this charade. This film blows so hard, it would make a 
   professional hooker give up her profession. This film doesn't 
   conclude, it just ends, like the filmmakers ran out of film and hoped 
   you didn't notice.&nbsp; It's films like this that gives tripe a bad 
   name. It's horrendously photographed (some shots are blocked so 
   poorly, heads are cut off at nose level, which leads me to believe 
   that this film was filmed open matte and cropped to look widescreen), 
   badly acted and full of dime store gore effects. This is just a lazy 
   film filled with too many questions and no answers. Even if we take 
   for granted that Sawney Bean somehow made the trip to California 
   unnoticed, when it's revealed that the Sheriff is actually working in 
   conjunction with the cannibal clan (even going as far as to set up 
   road blocks so the cannibals can attack unwary motorists), it just 
   shows how lazy director Leigh Scott (<B><A HREF="beast_of_bray_road_2005.htm">THE

   besides some cheap gore (a face being removed and then worn by one of 
   the cannibals; some throat slittings; flesh eating; various 
   dismemberments), but, again, the laziness factor comes into play by 
   giving the cannibals horribly mutated faces, but leaving the rest of 
   their extremities (like their arms and hands) totally untouched. 
   There's no other excuse for doing something like that except for 
   sheer laziness and shooting with a budget that wouldn't pay for the 
   craft service on the film that &quot;inspired&quot; it. The Asylum 
   has nothing but contempt for their audience, so why bother supporting

   horror films of the new Millennium are a mixed bag. Most of them rely 
   too much on CGI effects, even on practical makeup effects. They may 
   be saving themselves a few dollars, but CGI still hasn't progressed 
   to the point (at least in my eyes) of replacing good, old-fashioned 
   prosthetics blood and gore and those films that try to do it stick

   reluctant girlfriend Serina (Janet Montgomery; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#WrongTurn3">WRONG

   stripper at a titty bar who tries to give Tyler a lapdance on their 
   first meeting), head-out to the locations where the film was shot in 
   hope of locating Concannon and a copy of the film (But not before 
   Tyler cures Alexa of her heroin addiction and Serina cheats on Tyler 
   by sleeping with Lalo! Yeah, this is a screwed-up bunch.). While 
   Tyler films a documentary of their exploits, Alexa (whose memory is 
   fuzzy, but she believes her father died ten years ago) leads the 
   group to the film's locations and they eventually end up at the 
   film's main location: a house deep in the woods, where Tyler hopes to 
   discover a copy of the film in its attic (Talk about wishful 
   thinking!). What they don't count on is that the film's villain, 
   Babyface, may actually be real (Alexa tells everyone that Babyface 
   was portrayed by a local non-actor who was &quot;slow in the 
   head&quot;). It's not long before the documentary shoot turns into a 
   quest for survival, as Babyface begins his killing spree, 
   infidelities (of all kinds) are exposed and it looks as if someone

   lost film's gory killings (especially one poor girl getting torn in 
   half with the help of barb wire and a tree booby trap) reveals that 
   most of them were achieved with the help of CGI (In 1982? C'mon!). 
   Things go from bad to worse when a bunch of local yokels, led by 
   Sonny (Ewan Bailey), take the foursome captive in the middle of the 
   woods and begin to film their own porno film, with Alexa as the star 
   (we learn later that this was all a ruse), only to be saved by

   foursome has set-up this whole scenario from the start and has been 
   doing it for years, helping Daddy remake the film over-and-over since

   hollow for most of its running time, especially the ridiculous 
   torture porn finale, William Sadler's shameless over-acting and the

   Christopher Lee appears on screen to give us a brief history of the 
   human soul and how, throughout history, it is able to leave the body 
   and then return. Mr. Lee then goes on to describe evil spirits 
   throughout history. What does this have to do with the rest of the 
   film? Not very much, but it does lend a touch of class to a rather 
   classless film. The film proper opens with occult history teacher 
   Professor Cantrell (James Habif) giving a class to his college 
   students on an evil spirit called Morak, which legend says will do 
   your bidding if you chant his name. When the professor makes <A HREF="hollywood_meatcleaver_massacre_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/meatcleaver massacre dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>student
    Mason (Larry Justin) look like a fool in front of his classmates, he 
   and three of his buddies decide to teach the professor a lesson 
   (after getting drunk and stoned). Wearing stockings on their heads, 
   they break into the professor's house, where they knock out the 
   professor, savagely stab and kill his daughter, strangle her 
   boyfriend, murder the maid and even kill the dog. The professor 
   sustains a serious head injury and he is paralyzed from the neck 
   down, unable to speak but able to hear everything around him, 
   including a police detective saying to a doctor that they have no 
   idea who murdered his daughter. The professor summons the spirit of 
   Morak from his hospital bed and it's not long before this vengeful 
   spirit dishes out justice to the four punks who broke into the 
   professor's house. At first the spirit infects their dreams, showing 
   them they are about to die horrible deaths. The first one, Sean 
   (Robert Clark), takes a hike in the desert and is savagely slashed to 
   death by a cactus plant, his guts spilled all over his white tee 
   shirt. The second one, Dirk (Doug Senior), is repeatedly impaled in 
   the head by the latch of a car hood, which mysteriously slams itself 
   down over and over on his cranium. The third one, Phil (Bob Mead), 
   has his face burnt off by an exploding fuse box at the movie theater 
   he works at. Mason is saved for last and, as he searches the 
   professor's house for a way to fight the spirit, has his eye ripped 
   out by Morak, who takes physical form (he looks like a bigfoot 
   drop-out). Mason survives, but he lives the rest of his life as a 
   babbling idiot in a padded cell at the local looney bin.&nbsp; The 
   only way to properly describe this film is CHEAP. It looks like a 
   student film with all it's shakey hand held camerawork (which is 
   surprising because the director of photography was Guerdon Trueblood, 
   who directed the excellent thriller <B><A HREF="candy_snatchers_1973.htm">THE
    CANDY SNATCHERS</A></B> in 1973), trippy visuals and so-so acting by 
   a cast of unknowns. I'm willing to bet that one-time director Evan 
   Lee had nothing to do with the Christopher Lee wraparound segments. 
   They were probably added by the distribution company to pad out the 
   running time and possibly to increase it's boxoffice potential 
   (believe it or not, this did get a theatrical release). There are 
   some bloody moments and effective visuals on view but, overall, it's 
   just a minor horror film whose history is much more interesting than 
   the actual film itself. Notorious badfilm director Edward D. Wood Jr. 
   makes one of his final on-screen appearances as a photographer and

   actors gather at a house in the middle of the California woods to 
   rehearse various exercises for an acting class. Unfortunately, 
   sixteen years earlier in the same location, a special effects film 
   crew blew up the wrong house for the movie they were working on, 
   killing all eight members of the innocent Glouster family. Yeah, you

    NIGHTMARE</A></B> - 1982) puts his young thespians through their 
   paces, using the woods for various &quot;acting exercises&quot; with 
   deadly results. On one of those exercises, Vinnie sends all his 
   students out into the woods to find objects that they can interact 
   with in class. While most of the students come back with sticks, pine 
   cones or rocks, Mitch (Joe Balogh: <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#HitcherInTheDark">HITCHER

   bones, which belong to the deceased Mother Glouster. This even 
   pisses-off the three undead Glouster boys more than usual and they 
   step-up their killing spree, gut-stabbing one guy with a knife and 
   slicing the throat of a girl (both off-screen) as they are making out

   each other (or themselves) and countless sequences of the same people 
   (and camera POV shots) walking or running through the woods, 
   infrequently interrupted by some of the lamest murder scenes ever 
   committed to celluloid. Apparently, the special effects budget was 
   non-existent, so we never see any of the actual killings, only the 
   after-effects, which consists of nothing but throwing stage blood on 
   the dead bodies. No gaping, blood-spurting wounds here, folks. The 
   undead Glouster clan is no better; just three guys in flannel shirts, 
   stupid-looking hats or wool caps and plenty of burnt cork and oatmeal 
   rubbed on their faces and hands. They are about as frightening as the 
   hobos and vagabonds you see begging for spare change on street 
   corners. This film is like injecting a syringe containing 20 mg. of 
   valium into your veins: Your eyes will lose focus, your brain will 
   feel like mush and your body will go limp, yet with this film you'll 
   still have to endure 77 minutes of sheer inanity (The film proper is 
   only 66 minutes long, but it is padded with over 11 minutes of silent 
   previously-viewed footage in the finale, while the crappy 
   ear-bleeding title tune endlessly drones on until the final credits 
   roll and the film mercifully ends). Skip the movie and just pop a

   and doesn't seem too happy to be back (she's a real downer), as the 
   attempted suicide scars on her wrists bear out. The makeshift party 
   is unexpectedly crashed by Mr. Suitcase (Bill Moseley; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BabysitterWanted">BABYSITTER
    WANTED</A></B> - 2008), a smiling, bowtie-wearing stranger that no 
   one knows who is carrying a suitcase. He parks himself on the couch 
   and announces, &quot;I am here to give and not receive.&quot; He puts 
   on a pair of yellow latex gloves, opens his briefcase and reveals 
   that it is full of loose razorblades. He says that this is a 
   &quot;healing exercise&quot; and asks everyone to give him the name 
   of one person they really hate. Everyone is understandably freaked 
   out, but he forces them to answer. Robert hates his boss. Candice 
   hates her ex-boyfriend (who happens to be Ben, from earlier in the 
   film). Mark hates Matthew (Patrick Engel), a drug dealer. Claire 
   hates Anthony (L.C. Holt). Tim hates &quot;everyone in this fucking 
   room.&quot; With each announcement, Mr. Suitcase reaches into his 
   case, picks out a razor and slashes his own arm (the same arm that is 
   holding Candice in a headlock) and we are shown brief flash-forwards 
   of the hated people dying. Just as quick as he enters, Mr. Suitcase 
   then leaves, but not before singing a hobo song and wishing everyone 
   a &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;. Since we already saw Ben die a nasty 
   death in the beginning of the film, I guess we can all see where this 
   film is heading. Everyone who the group said they hated begins dying 
   gory deaths at the hands of a black-hooded demon, until we come to 
   Tim's pick: The entire group themselves. Can they find a way to 
   reverse this curse before they all end up dead? After getting to know

   killing from <B><A HREF="american_history_x_1998.htm">AMERICAN

   are the most unlikable or morose bunch of people you'll ever meet 
   (Candice and Tim are cokeheads; Mark and Robert work in a funeral 
   home; Claire is just a sad excuse for a human being), that when they 
   do die, there's no emotional involvement on the viewer's part (and 
   why do most of them wear dark makeup under their eyes?). As a matter 
   of fact, the group that told Mr. Suitcase who they hate are much 
   worse than those who are hated. I'm a big fan of Tiffany Shepis (who 
   gets her foot sliced in half between her toes with a knife before 
   having her skull caved-in with a ballpeen hammer), but even I was 
   embarrassed for her here (even though she does go topless and pukes 
   on a corpse!), so I was glad when she was killed early on. <B><A HREF="home_sick_2007c.htm">HOME

    in the head and has a thing for Nina, finds the leader of the rats 
   (a female white rat) caught in a trap and frees it, naming it 
   &quot;Tara&quot; (&quot;a rat&quot; spelled backwards), after 
   jokingly saying he's going to name her Ben (this is basically an 
   urban version of <B><A HREF="willard_1971.htm">WILLARD</A></B> - 
   1971, its sequel <B><A HREF="ben_1972.htm">BEN</A></B> - 1972 and was 
   filmed under the title <B>TARA</B>) and they become fast friends. 
   Before you know it, Tara is stealing food out of Mr. Souilliez's 
   apartment and bringing it to a hungry Max and introducing Max to all 
   her rat friends. While Mr. Souilliez learns the hard way about life 
   in the tenements (the screams and gunfire at night; getting cold 
   because the boiler doesn't work; the electricity going on and off), 
   Tara and her rat pack begin killing people who pick on Max, beginning 
   with the two street thugs who stole his father's watch. Max falls 
   into a funk when he discovers Nina making love to her ex-boyfriend, 
   who has returned for some nookie. This leads to Courtney freezing to 
   death when he falls out of his wheelchair outside during a cold 
   Winter's night. Max doesn't hear his cries for help, but the two 
   crackheads and Mr. Souilliez do, but they all choose to ignore him. 
   When Mr. Souilliez discovers Max in the basement and thinks he's a 
   squatter (Grady has been pocketing the fifty dollars a month without 
   telling his boss), he beats Max repeatedly with a metal pipe and 
   tosses him outside into the cold, all under the watchful eyes of 
   Tara. When Max discovers Courtney's frozen corpse outside and Grady 
   denies to the police that he was ever allowed to live in the tenant 
   building's basement, the police arrest Max when he goes bonkers and 
   calls them all liars, the police thinking he is drunk. When Max is 
   released from custody, he and Tara get even with all the people who 
   have wronged him and Courtney. Things begin to go terribly wrong when 
   Tara grows jealous and kills Nina, which makes Max finally see the 
   errors of his ways. He blows up the tenement building to kill 
   himself, Tara and her pack of rats. But is he successful? As I have 
   previously mentioned, this is basically a black version of <B>WILLARD</B> 
   (which was <A HREF="willard_2003.htm">itself remade in 2003</A> with 
   Crispin Glover as the star), where Max befriends a rat and reaps all 
   the benefits of the relationship before he goes too far and ruins it. 
   Director Leslie Small (who usually directs comedy concert films, 
   including comedian Kevin Hart's highly affecting comedy 
   concert/documentary film <B><A HREF="laugh_at_my_pain_2011.htm">LAUGH 
   AT MY PAIN</A></B> - 2011) and screenwriter Stan Foster (<B><A HREF="hangmans_curse_2003.htm">HANGMAN'S
    CURSE</A></B> - 2003) pepper the film with plenty of black 
   stereotypes (the horny black crackhead couple; the mean-as-dirt 
   slumlord; the dastardly boyfriend that Nina just can't resist) and a 
   lot of bad editing tricks (freeze frames; film speed-ups and 
   slow-downs, usually in the same scene), but some of the rat attack 
   scenes are convincing (when they aren't using obvious CGI), as is the 
   gore (lots of chewed body parts). Max's transformation from a halfwit 
   to lord of the rats is a bit rather much (he goes from speaking in 
   broken sentences to full-fledged prose, like he is rehearsing for a 
   role in a Shakespeare play!), but this is not nearly as bad as other 
   reviewers are making it out to be. It is competently acted, has a 
   sense of humor amongst the carnage and is professionally made on all 
   technical levels. This film is nothing like those SOV urban films on 
   DVD that flooded supermarket shelves from Maverick Entertainment 
   (read my review of <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Recoil2001">RECOIL</A></B>

    head. They are heading to the home of the Reverend Salo Jr. (Vincent 
   Lamberti), who visited the center the day before and gave Luck a bag 
   of goodies, which included some psychedelic mushrooms. While driving 
   to the home, they eat the mushrooms, which causes one of them to turn 
   blue and get sick, while the others have hallucinations, including 
   Luck, who sees two demon pumpkins floating in the air. Reverend 
   Salo's daughter, Grace (Lizzy Mahon), is slowly losing her mind, 
   thanks to her father and abusive mother (Christie Sanford) drugging 
   and brainwashing her (for reasons which are kind of explained later 
   in the film). Grace's only comfort comes from the kind attention of 
   her grandfather, Reverend Salo Sr. (The Amazing Kreskin), a mentalist 
   who is able to calm Grace with mere words and the power of 
   suggestion. But things turn real crazy when Grace finds out that her 
   grandfather has been dead for a week (was she really talking to him 
   or was she dreaming?), Luck kills Salo Jr and his wife after a rather 
   strange hallucination (or does he kill them?) and Grace meets the 
   five teens and they are chased and threatened by an unseen force 
   (which manifests itself in many forms, including a little girl with a 
   horribly burned face). What does this all mean and why does a horned 
   goat show up just before something really bad happens? No really.

   the sountrack is full of eerie, ambient effects. You'll see a man 
   whose brains are leaking out of his head, a forect full of zombies, 
   various shots of burnt and rotting faces and other random atmospheric 
   tricks which gives the film an otherworldly feel. It is as if this is 
   all happening on some alternate universe. If it seems like some of 
   the actors are in a trance, it's because Kreskin would use his 
   mentalist powers on them to &quot;suggest&quot; how the scenes should 
   be played just before the camera rolled. That has to be some kind of 
   film first and it really does show in the cast when they are on 
   screen. It's kind of spooky and unsettling. There's an amazing (no 
   pun intended) special feature on the DVD where Kreskin displays his 
   powers of suggestion on a group of disbelieving people. They become 
   believers when he is done with them. Filmed during the Winter of 2001

   Hunter (Rossana Podest&agrave;; <B><A HREF="seven_golden_men_strike_again_1966.htm">SEVEN

    BENEATH THE DESERT</A></B> - 1961), is not in bed, so she goes 
   looking for him through their creepy castle, the screams getting 
   louder. She enters the castle's ancient torture room (every castle 
   has one, especially in Italian gothic horror films) and notices drops 
   of blood next to the Iron Maiden, a.k.a. the &quot;Virgin of 
   Nuremberg&quot; (An alternate title for the film. If you don't know 
   what it is, Google it). She opens it and discovers a dead woman's 
   body inside, her eyes poked out by the spikes inside it. Mary passes 
   out and&nbsp; the device closes on its own. The anglicized credits

   - 1973), who tells Max that she suffered a severe shock. Max shows

   Punisher&quot; (He looks similar to Mickey Hargitay in <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#BloodyPitHorror1965">BLOODY

   Erich (Christopher Lee; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#WhipAndTheBody1963">THE
    WHIP AND THE BODY</A></B> - 1963, another eerie gothic horror film), 
   a close friend of Max's father whose face was hideously disfigured in 
   World War II. Mary doesn't understand why Max lets him live in the 
   castle because she finds him creepy. While Mary is pretending to 
   sleep, she watches Max get dressed and walk out of their bedroom, so 
   she follows him. She watches as he enters the torture room and after 
   almost getting caught by Martha (Laura Nucci; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BloodstainShadow78">THE
    BLOODSTAINED SHADOW</A></B> - 1978), the castle's housekeeper, Mary 
   enters the torture room and is caught by Erich, who tells her that 
   all of the torture devices belonged to &quot;The General&quot;, Max's 
   father. Erich also tells Mary that Max took the car into town, but 
   she is sure that she saw him enter this room, which only has one way

    Mary goes outside, where she meets John Selby (Jim Dolen; <B><A HREF="evil_eye_1963.htm">EVIL
    EYE</A></B> - 1963), who tells her he is interested in German 
   castles and begins asking her questions about her husband's family, 
   but he makes a hasty retreat when he sees Martha, who tells Mary that 
   he is an international policeman. She also tells Mary that the 
   Punisher has returned after three centuries and that she is the 
   reason he has returned. Mary doesn't want to hear such foolishness 
   and then spies on Erich in the family tomb, where he yells out, 
   &quot;Mein herr, mein herr, where are you?&quot; Mary is then 
   confronted by the Punisher, who tells her he has something to show 
   her, but Erich's yells scare him away. Martha tells Mary to go to her 
   bedroom and lock the door, not letting anyone in. Is she trying to 
   drive Mary mad? Has the Punisher come back from the dead?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   conversation. That night, someone pretending to be Max tries to break 
   down the door to Mary's bedroom. When he puts his fist through the 
   door and tries to unlock it, Mary stabs him in the hand with a 
   dagger. As morning comes, Mary leaves her bedroom, where she watches

   death is the fate I have in store for you!&quot;). Mary becomes 
   trapped in the castle's cemetery, where she watches as the Punisher 
   puts a cage with a rat inside on Annabelle's face, where the rat 
   begins chewing away. When the Punisher leaves, Mary pulls the cage 
   off her face, half of her nose eaten away. Annabelle passes out (She 
   says, &quot;I can't live like this!&quot;) and when Mary leaves the 
   cemetery, she sees the body of Max on the ground, dressed as the 
   Punisher and she faints. When she wakes, Max is next to her, alive. 
   She tells him what she saw and Max pleads with her to give him a few 
   hours and he will explain everything. Mary agrees and then confronts 
   Martha, who tells her that the Punisher is not evil, he is 
   &quot;sick&quot;. Is Max the sick one? Or is Erich? Could it be 
   someone else? Mary decides to leave the castle, but that is easier

    Filled with great sets (filmed at Villa Sciarra, Rome, a real

    VERGINE DE NORIMBERGA</A></B>, is hard to beat when it comes to 
   Italian Gothic horror films. The screenplay, by Margheriti, Ernesto 
   Gastaldi (billed as &quot;Gastad Green&quot;; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Almost Human">ALMOST

    HANDS OF ORLAC</A></B> - 1960), hits all the right notes, even if 
   the mystery is easy to solve. If I have one complaint, it is that 
   Christopher Lee didn't dub his own voice and whenever he speaks, it 
   takes you out of the film if you know what he actually sounds like. 
   This is a minor quibble, though, as this is a wonderfully filmed 
   slice of Gothic horror. Although the violence is tame by today's 
   standards, it was quite graphic back in the day, especially the 
   rat/face scene, the opening sequence and the unmasking of the 
   Punisher. The finale is also touching, as Erich comforts the dying 
   Punisher as the castle burns around them. Another childhood memory

   his pet guinea pig Mr. Mumps than any other class he takes. He is 
   working on a serum that can change animal and man back to their more

   her desk and gives Vernon an F on his English paper without even 
   reading it. Back at the lab, a black cat belonging to mean janitor 
   Mr. Griggs (Jeff Alexander) is sitting on top of Mr. Mumps' cage, so 
   Vernon shoos it away with a broom, causing Mr. Griggs to threaten 
   Vernon's life. Phys-Ed Coach McCall (John Niland, a Dallas Cowboys 
   linebacker from 1973 to 1982) refuses to excuse rail-thin Vernon from 
   class and he gets hassled by Roger (Mike McHenry), Robin's boyfriend 
   and football star, and his friends, who play keepaway with Vernon's 
   notebook, his only means of rewriting his biology paper. In other 
   words, Vernon's life is a living hell at high school, but that is 
   about to change. Vernon tries his serum on Mr. Mumps, only to later 
   find Mr. Griggs' black cat dead dead in Mr. Mumps' cage, with Mr. 
   Mumps covered in blood. When Mr. Griggs catches Vernon trying to 
   dissolve the cat in a drum of sulphuric acid in the lab, he attacks 
   Vernon with a huge pestle and makes him drink his own serum. Mr. 
   Griggs then bloodily kills Mr. Mumps with the pestle (footage missing 
   from the edited print) while Vernon turns into a monster (which is no 
   more than just throwing some hair on his face and knuckles and giving 
   him a limp), shoving Mr. Griggs face into the sulphuric acid, killing 
   him (the R-rated print lingers longer on Griggs screaming in pain 
   with his face melting away). Vernon disposes of the bodies of Mr. 
   Griggs, Mr. Mumps and the cat in the acid drum, only to have Griggs

   bones of a cat and a guinea pig were also discovered in the acid drum 
   by the crime lab, but he can't prove anything. The monster Vernon 
   resumes his killing ways, this time paying attention to Miss 
   Grindstaff, whom he chops off her fingers and decapitates her with 
   her own paper cutter (scenes missing from the edited print, where it 
   is only implied). He then pays close attention to Coach McCall (who 
   wanted Vernon to cheat on the biology test for the failing Roger, 
   otherwise Roger would be ineligible for football the following year), 
   whom he meets at 10:00 PM in the gymnasium. The super-strong monster 
   Vernon throws McCall onto the bleachers and stomps him to death while 
   wearing a pair of spiked shoes (extended much longer in the R-rated

   moving swiftly and Pat Cardi (his last acting effort; he did many TV 
   series guest roles in the 60's &amp; early-70's) as Vernon is a very 
   sympathetic character. The restored scenes make this film worth 
   viewing again, especially if you have only seen the TV version, in 
   which there are six minutes of footage of Vernon's widowed salesman 
   father talking to him on the phone (we never see Vernon during this 
   footage) and arguing with his rich girlfriend. The excision of this 
   footage gives the film the right pacing that it needs and the 
   restored footage contains a lot of blood. This film isn't a must-see 
   by any means (Especially the 70's-style flowered shirts worn by the 
   male students. Did I actually dress like that? Yes, I did!), but it 
   is a nice time capsule of the way independent regional horror films

   $67,000.00). Also starring pro footballer Joe Greene (<B><A HREF="action.htm#Black Six">THE

   films has been going on since the days of silent films) and the film 
   is about 50% new footage and 50% of the Filipino film. The finished 
   film finally got a theatrical release in 1970. This is probably one 
   of my favorite of Adamson's films because I'm a huge fan of films 
   shot in the Philippines and this one is a real corker. The film 
   begins with overwrought offscreen narration by Brother Theodore (God, 
   I loved that man! People called him a &quot;performance artist&quot;, 
   but to me, he was one of the funniest people I ever had the pleasure 
   to see perform live.) who described how vampirism has taken over the 
   Earth, as we watch people being bitten by vampires in teeth so fake, 
   it makes those plastic vampire teeth you bought during Halloween look 
   professional. We see a man being bitten in a warehouse, a necking 
   couple in a car, where the girl turns out to be a vampire and bites 
   her boyfriend on the neck, another vampire (played by Adamson 
   himself) attacking a woman walking down a dark street, while Brother 
   Theodore prattles on how this affliction came to Earth from a distant 
   planet and it cannot be destroyed. We are then given a demonstration 
   of the wonders of Spectrum-X, where a vampire changes colors on 
   screen, just to let us know what to expect in about 20 minutes. We 
   then watch a vampire (played by the late Gary Graver) attack a mother 
   while her young son (played by Graver's son Sean) runs away and then 
   all the vampires we have just seen group together and attack a 
   teenage boy while Brother Theodore says a scientific team is being 
   sent by spaceship to the planet where the affliction started to try 
   and find a cure. We then get to view one of the cheapest Mission 
   Control rooms ever seen on film (the chairs are nothing but plastic 
   ones you would find in 1960's cafeterias!), as Commander Bryce (Bruce 
   Powers) lifts off in spaceship XB-13 with his crew, which includes 
   cranky Dr. Rynning (John Carradine), Willy (Joey Benson), Bob Scott 
   (Fred Meyers) and Linda (Britt Semand). The only two people at 
   Mission Control (Two people for a major mission like this????) are 
   Dr. Manning (Robert Dix) and his wife Valerie (Vicki Volante). As 
   soon as XB-13 takes off, it is hit by a solar storm magnetic field 
   and everyone on board is knocked out and the XB-13 is sent veering 
   off course. Dr. Manning and Valerie try to get in radio contact (wait 
   until you get a gander at their microphones!) with Commander Bryce 
   and finally do when he wakes up (When Willy wakes up, he says, 
   &quot;Next time I'm gonna go Greyhound and leave the driving to 
   them!&quot;). Once Dr. Rynning gets up after being knocked 
   unconscious, he starts barking out orders like a rabid dog (Carradine 
   is not very likable in this film and that is putting it mildly). Dr. 
   Manning tells Dr. Rynning that his instruments indicate that the 
   storm has depleted most of their oxygen, so Dr. Rynning finds a 
   planet that may be able to sustain human life if the spaceship and 
   the crew makes in there in 3-4 days. They manage to land on the 
   planet and this is where Spectrum-X comes into play. Dr. Rynning 
   makes up some mumbo-jumbo to cover the fact that we are about to see 
   a bunch Filipinos play cavemen in a black &amp; white film tinted in 
   different colors. Dr. Manning also informs Dr. Rynning that he must 
   remain on the spaceship since the storm gave him a mild heart attack 
   and if he were to walk, he could die (Carradine probably took this 
   role because all he would have to do is sit around and act like an 
   asshole). The tinting of the film keeps changing colors, as the crew 
   investigates outside and sees stock footage of dinosaurs and giant 
   lizards attacking each other (in footage borrowed from <B><A HREF="one_million_bc_1940.htm">ONE
    MILLION B.C.</A></B> [1940] and <B><A HREF="unknown_island_1948.htm">UNKNOWN
    ISLAND</A></B> [1948]) as Dr. Rynning spews out orders to make sure 
   they collect samples for him to analyze. We then see the first scene 
   from the Filipino film. Two warring cavemen tribes are going at it 
   and one tribe member gets an arrow in his back (as far as I know, 
   cavemen didn't have bow and arrows!). This and other Filipino footage 
   are the most entertaining parts of the film. as we see the tribes 
   (the &quot;Tagani Tribe&quot; are the good guys) beat each other over 
   the head with clubs, impale each other with spears, shoot each other 
   with arrows and throw fire bombs at each other. The Tagani are 
   running out of &quot;fire water&quot; (i.e. oil) and need to find 
   some soon or the other nasty tribe (who sport huge fangs) will win 
   the war. Our spacemen capture a prehistoric woman named Malian 
   (Jennifer Bishop) and install a &quot;communicator&quot; device in 
   her head (some on-the-fly unclean surgical operation), so she can 
   understand what they say and they can understand what she says (Which 
   begs the question: Why do we hear members of the Tagani Tribe speak 
   English before this device was installed?). She relays a flashback 
   (more extended footage from the Filipino film) of the two tribes 
   beating the snot out of each other. For reasons known only to the 
   late Al Adamson, we then cut to Dr. Manning and his wife making love 
   through some electronic machine with different colored neon tubes and 
   then go back to the Filipino flashback. Then, once again, we are back 
   with Dr. Manning and his wife as he gives a demonstration of 
   Spectrum-X (which we already were shown in the beginning of the film) 
   and Dr. Manning says that red seems to be considered the most 
   dangerous color (it never comes into play in this film) and then they 
   go back to making electronic love with their machine. I mean, what 
   the hell? We then go back to the Filipino film, where the leader of 
   the bad tribe cuts open a Tagani Tribe member's chest with a sharp 
   object and starts drinking his blood. Malian tells the spacemen that 
   she knows a place where the tribe can find the fire water and 
   Commander Bryce asks Dr. Rynning if they can convert the oil to work 
   in their cooling system so they can take off in their spaceship. Dr. 
   Rynning says it is possible, but first Malian needs to help her tribe 
   collect some fire water to battle the other tribe. In the film's 
   weirdest scene, we watch as the leader of the Tagani Tribe battle a 
   lobster man in a river. The creature has huge claws for hands, yet 
   the leader kills it and the rest of the lobster people see it and go 
   underwater (it is a creepy scene). We than see the Tagani Tribe (but 
   no Malian) enter a cave where the fire water is located and get 
   attacked by a group of flying batmen (the bat man in <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#TwilightPeople1972">TWILIGHT
    PEOPLE</A></B> [1972; another Filipino film], looks like a Rick 
   Baker creation in comparison). The Tagani kill all the creatures and 
   collect their fire water and after they leave Malian miraculously 
   appears and leads the spacemen to the cave with Commander Bryce 
   telling Bob to head back to the spaceship to get some containers to 
   put it in. After watching more dinosaur and giant lizard stock 
   footage, Bob returns with the containers and the spacemen collect all 
   the fire water they can carry. Commander Bryce and Linda find a <A HREF="horror_of_the_blood_monsters_1965-1970.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/horror of the blood monsters dvd9 front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="203" HEIGHT="286" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>solid
    steel metal case while they are leaving the cave and wonder what 
   something like that would be doing on a planet full of cavemen who 
   are just learning about fire. Dr. Rynning tells them to bring back 
   the steel case and everyone has ten minutes to get back to the 
   spaceship or they will die. Seems there is a virus in the atmosphere 
   that eats the red corpuscles in the blood. Malain wants Willy to 
   stay, but he gets dizzy and everyone makes it back to the spaceship 
   in time and takes off (this is really an embarassing effect, even for 
   1966), leaving Malian and everyone else on the planet to die. THE 
   END. Huh? What about the steel case? They don't care what happens to 
   the Tagani, especially Malian?&nbsp; It's apparent Al Adamson had no 
   idea on how to end the film, which is why it could have taken four 
   years to make it to theaters through Sam Sherman and Independent 
   International, who throughout the next two decades would re-release 
   the film under a myriad of titles, including <B><A HREF="astro_vampire_1970.htm">ASTRO-VAMPIRE</A></B>;
    <B><A HREF="space_mission_to_the_lost_planet_1970.htm">SPACE MISSION

    MEN OF THE LOST PLANET</A></B>; and at least a half-dozen more. Most 
   of Adamson's films have at least five titles, especially the ones 
   handled by Independent International, who didn't own a film they 
   didn't retitle at least once. The lovemaking scenes between Robert 
   Dix and Vicki Volante were probably put in the film to make it 
   feature length, but Adamson couldn't have picked a worst place in the 
   film to insert the scenes. It interrupts the flow of the only 
   interesting part of the film. Adamson doesn't even give <B>TAGANI</B> 
   director Rolf Bayer (<B><A HREF="pacific_inferno_1979.htm">PACIFIC INFERNO</A></B> 
   - 1979) any credit at all or even mention the film, even though 50% 
   of the film is his. Actually, there were three versions if the film 
   made: Two shot in the Philippines languages of Tagalog and Visayan 
   called <B><A HREF="tagani_1965.htm">KAHARIANG BATO</A></B>&nbsp;

   same cast. Maybe someday we will see the English version released on 
   legitimate disc (it is available on torrents, but I will not use 
   them), but until then, you get a taste of half of the film by 
   watching this movie. It's a hell of a mess with more questions than 
   answers, but if you like obscure Filipino films, you could do a lot 
   worse than <B><A HREF="horror_of_the_blood_monsters_1965-1970b.htm">HORROR

   Everyone has defining moments in their life. It's those times that 
   something happens that you'll never forget no matter how long you 
   live. This film gave me one of those moments. Back in the 70's, all 
   you had on TV were over-the-air channels. Cable was just in it's 
   infancy and many towns weren't even wired for it yet. You had to make 
   do <A HREF="horror_rises_from_the_tomb_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/horror rises from the tomb dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="192" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>with
    whatever channels you could get with the antennae on your roof or 
   the rabbit ears on top of your set. A lot depended on the area where 
   you lived (distance + topography) and how big that roof antennae 
   really was. I was lucky where I lived in New Jersey. We got all the 
   major channels: CBS (2); NBC (4); ABC (7); plus all the independents: 
   WNEW (5); WOR (9); WPIX (11) and PBS (13). We were also lucky to pick 
   up some UHF channels, like the one that showed Uncle Floyd (who 
   helped shape my demented teenage years) and Channel 48, the Spanish 
   station broadcasting out of beautiful downtown Paterson, NJ. Since my 
   father was somewhat of a raving racist, the only time I watched 
   Channel 48 was when he went to bed. I didn't know a lick of Spanish 
   but, somehow, I was always drawn to that station because they showed 
   wrestling (Lucha Libre) in two hour blocks and they showed movies, 
   all without commercials and all unedited. Mainly, the movies they 
   screened were Mexican comedies starring Cantiflas or soap operas 
   (novellas), but every once in a while they would slip you a mickey 
   and show a film completely unsuitable for TV (at that time). This 
   film (broadcast under the title &quot;<B><I><A HREF="el_espanto_surge_de_la_tumba_1972.htm">El
    Espanto Surge De La Tumba</A></I></B>&quot;) was one of them. It was 
   my first exposure to the Spanish horror films of Paul Naschy and I 
   haven't looked back since. This film was quite an eye-opener for this 
   teenager (this was 1974) because I was just beginning to &quot;get 
   into&quot; horror films and this was one of the bloodiest films I 
   ever saw. Let me also set the record straight: Until recently (the 
   Mondo Crash DVD), the English-dubbed versions floating around now 
   can't hold a candle to the Spanish-language I saw this one time. It 
   had much more gore and nudity (including bush) than the dubbed 
   versions. The story is simple: Back in the 16th century, a satanist 
   (Naschy) is beheaded, his body and head buried in separate locations 
   so they can never be joined together again. Before he dies, he puts a 
   curse on his brother and his descendants. His wife also suffers a 
   similar fate. In the present day, Hugo (Naschy again) goes to a 
   seance with some friends, where he sees the apparition of his 
   bodyless ancestor's head and it tells him the location of his body 
   and his head. They all travel to his ancestral home where some of 
   them (and the help) become possessed and join the head back to the 
   body. The parts merge back together, he comes back to life and then 
   revives his long-dead wife. They both go on a terror spree and begin 
   to hunt down Hugo and his friends, using zombies, possession, a 
   shotgun and their bare hands to exact their revenge. The last<A HREF="horror_rises_from_the_tomb_1972b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/horror rises from the tomb vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="89" HEIGHT="156" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   two surviving members form a plan to defeat this demonic duo. I know 
   this film may not seem like such a big deal today, but back in 1974 
   it was something else, especially all the bloody mayhem that my eyes 
   had not seen (at least not in one single film). The opening minutes 
   show a man being decapitated and a naked woman hung upside down and 
   then having her heart cut out. The rest of the film contained 
   full-frontal female nudity, breast-fondling, breast slicing, lesbian 
   trysts, blood drinking, a really atmospheric mass zombie attack, a 
   shotgun murder, a really graphic scene of a heart being ripped-out of 
   a chest (the film's highlight), an axe in the chest, a needle through 
   the heart, not to mention one final decapitation. Seeing all this on 
   TV in 1974 was certainly something I never expected to see. Finding 
   any information about this film, or any Spanish horror film, back 
   then was next to impossible. There was no internet or those plentiful 
   reference books that are available today. It wasn't until a year or 
   two later, when Embassy Pictures released a bunch of Spanish titles 
   as part of a TV package, that I saw my next Spanish horror film. The 
   package included <B><A HREF="bell_from_hell_1971.htm">A BELL FROM HELL</A></B>

   table and throw a weekend party in his honor (they also dance with 
   his corpse!). That will prove to be a stupid and deadly mistake on 
   their part. When his body is discovered missing by the cops the next 
   morning, Conrad's widow Etta (Barbara Pilavin) goes to medium Mrs. 
   Rohmer (Nita Talbot; <B><A HREF="#Island Claws">ISLAND CLAWS</A></B> 
   - 1981) to contact the spirit of her dead husband to find out where 
   his body was taken. Conrad talks through the body of Mrs. Rohmer and 
   tells Etta that he went directly to Hell when he died (When Etta 
   discovers this, she tells her dead husband to get revenge of those 
   who stole his body by screaming out, &quot;Burn them! Burn 
   them!&quot;). Conrad's dead body springs to life and begins killing 
   the film students, beginning with Oscar (Alan Stock), who has his 
   tongue ripped out of his mouth, and his girlfriend Donna (Donna 
   McDaniel), who spontaneously bursts into flame (thanks to Conrad's 
   telekinetic powers). Bobo (Scott Thomson) dies next, killed when he 
   is trapped in Conrad's tomb and <A HREF="frightmare_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/frightmare 1981 poster small2a.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="174" HEIGHT="250" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>succumbs
    to deadly crypt gas (Is there such a thing?). Conrad kills Eve 
   (Carlene Olson) when he telekinetically floats a coffin in the air 
   and uses it as a battering ram against her body, When Stu loses his 
   head to Conrad's sword (his head is then feasted upon by a raven), 
   Saint and Meg decide to return Conrad's body to the crypt, but one 
   more will die before Conrad is finally laid to rest.&nbsp; While just 
   another &quot;teen trapped in a haunted house&quot; scenario, this 
   film does have the advantage of having great character actor Ferdy 
   (billed here as &quot;Ferdinand&quot;) Mayne as it's villain. He's a 
   strikingly imposing figure here, not only when he's creeping around 
   the dark corridors of the deserted funeral parlor, but also in the 
   unnerving short films that play whenever anyone enters his crypt. 
   Director/scripter Norman Thaddeus Vane, who also gave us the weird 
   horror-tinged <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Black Room 1981">THE 
   BLACK ROOM</A></B> (1981) and the black comedy <B><A HREF="midnight_1989.htm">MIDNIGHT</A></B> 
   (1989; starring Vanessa Redgrave as a bitchy Elvira-like horror 
   host), keeps the film moving at a quick pace, but one has to question 
   the actions of the film students. I know this is only a film, but 
   c'mon, not only are they grave robbers, they also defile Conrad's 
   corpse by dancing, kissing (yech!) and partying with it. Can you 
   imagine someone doing that with Karloff or Price's dead bodies? I 
   can't. If you can get past that major faux pas, you may find yourself 
   liking this film (it's better known under the title <B><A HREF="frightmare_1981.htm">FRIGHTMARE</A></B>).
    It has some effective scenes (greatly enhanced by the atmospheric 
   soundtrack, which is full of distorted sound effects and music), a 
   few instances of gore and a wicked sense of sick humor (especially in 
   Conrad's filmed shorts). Not a bad little film. Verkina Flower (the 
   late George &quot;Buck&quot; Flower's daughter) was Wardrobe

    MASSACRE</A><A NAME="Hospital Massacre"></A> (1981) - </B>In 1961, 
   young Susan receives a Valentine's Day card from Harold, which she 
   promptly crumples up and throws to the floor. Harold, who is watching 
   through a window, is not amused and impales her brother David's head 
   on a coat rack. Nineteen years pass and an adult Susan (Barbi Benton) 
   is in a hospital on Valentine's day to pick up some test results from 
   a check-up she had the week before for insurance purposes for her new 
   promotion at her job. Almost immediately, she gets stuck in an 
   elevator while a psycho (dressed as a mask-wearing surgeon) kills 
   Susan's doctor (with a huge knife) and switches Susan's x-rays with 
   someone else's (probably his). The psycho then kills an orderly by 
   sticking his head in a sink filled with acid after he finds the 
   doctor's dead body. Susan meets another doctor named Harry (Chip 
   Lucia), who takes a look at her false x-rays and sends her to Dr. 
   Saxon (John Warner Williams), who makes her get undressed (yay!) and 
   examines her topless (it's filmed to look as if he's feeling her up). 
   Thus begins Susan's nightmare, as the doctors, based on the false 
   x-rays, force her to stay in the hospital to run further tests. After 
   the doctors run a battery of unknown tests (and drunk patient Hal [Lanny<A HREF="hospital_massacre_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hospital massacre vhs front small2a.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Duncan] watching her topless through a crack in the window shades), 
   things start to get extremely bloody. A nurse typing up Susan's new 
   test results is murdered and the killer replaces the test results 
   with false ones. The list of suspects is pretty wide by now. Besides 
   all the people mentioned, there is also Susan's bitter ex-husband Tom 
   (Jimmy Stathis) and her present boyfriend Jack (Jon Van Ness). You 
   can wipe Jack off the suspect list because he is the next to be 
   killed. He comes to the hospital at Susan's urging and the killer 
   uses an electric bone saw to cut off his head, which he puts in a hat 
   box and delivers to Susan's room. When Dr. Saxon finds Susan's real 
   x-rays, the killer plants an axe in his head. Susan is strapped to a 
   bed (the doctors now believe she is psychotic) as the killer murders 
   a nurse with a hypo full of acid to the heart and Dr. Bean (Den 
   Surles) with a knife through the neck. The killer brings Susan to an 
   operating room, where he unmasks himself and makes his intentions 
   known (he wants her heart).&nbsp; Israeli director Boaz Davidson (<B><A HREF="last_american_virgin_1982.htm">THE
    LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN</A></B> - 1982; <B><A HREF="american_cyborg_steel_warriors_1993.htm">AMERICAN
    CYBORG: STEEL WARRIOR</A></B> - 1993) has crafted a suspenseful, if 
   unremarkable, slasher flick. We are not let in as to what condition 
   the doctors think Susan is in until the film is nearly over. We know 
   it's something extraordinary by the way the doctors and nurses react 
   to the phony x-ray and test results, but we are never really told. 
   That fact alone keeps the viewer glued to the screen because, in 
   Susan's words to Jack, &quot;They've been treating me like I've got 
   leprosy or something!&quot; Playboy Playmate and ex-Hugh Hefner 
   squeeze Barbi Benton puts in a welcomed extended nude scene and 
   actually holds up quite well in her role as a woman who need answers 
   but gets none. The real star of this film is the hospital itself. The 
   smoke-covered hallways (the 9th floor is being fumigated!), forboding 
   wards, where one floor is nothing but old, dying people groaning and 
   hooked up to IVs and another has rows of people bandaged from head to 
   toe and doctors and nurses who act as if they are working in a looney 
   bin rather than a normal hospital, adds an air of mystery to an 
   otherwise ordinary story. There's enough red herrings here to keep 
   you guessing, but if you have been paying close attention (especially 
   to the prologue), the killer's identity shouldn't be too much of a 
   surprise. Still, it's pretty good for what it is, as it has plenty of 
   bloody kills, weird atmosphere and, of course, Barbi Benton's huge 
   nipples to keep you pleasantly entertained. This Cannon Films

    today. It's just that this Eli Roth (<B><A HREF="cabin_fever_2002.htm">CABIN
    FEVER</A></B> - 2002)-directed film is just plain nasty in it's 
   second half. Unnecessarily nasty. Three guys travel around Europe 
   before getting serious in their life. While they were staying in 
   Amsterdam (getting stoned and fucking every girl in sight), they meet 
   a guy (with a tremendous mole above his lip), who tells them about a 
   hostel they can stay in in some Slavik country (actually filmed in 
   the Czech Republic), where they can get all the good looking pussy 
   they want. Little do they know that they are being set up in one of 
   the most perverse situations ever committed to film. Once they get to 
   the hostel, they meet two girls who promise them a really good time. 
   After some of the prerequesite naked sex scenes, the film takes a 180 
   degree turn as the guys begin to disappear one-by-one. It seems that 
   they are being killed for sport or just plain for the thrill of it by 
   rich people looking to see how it feels to kill a person. An American 
   specimen gets the highest price. They are strapped down to chairs and 
   murdered in various ways in an old abandoned building filled with 
   hallways and killing rooms. The first of the guys, Oli (Eythor 
   Gudjonsson, the best thing about this film) a man from Iceland who 
   the other two hooked up with (he's the kind of funny dude anyone 
   would want to hang out with), has his head cut off. The second guy, 
   Josh (Derek Richardson), is strapped to a chair and impaled several 
   times with an electric drill before being cut to pieces by a Dutch 
   businessman (Jan Vlas&aacute;k, who raises the creep factor several 
   notches), who the three met on a train to the hostel. The last guy, 
   Paxton (Jay Hernandez) is handcuffed to a chair and has two of his 
   fingers cut off by a chainsaw by a German guy (Petr Janis), but 
   escapes after the German slips on Paxton's blood and cuts off his leg 
   with the chainsaw. Paxton, who first hides underneath a pile of body 
   parts (including his best friend Josh) being chopped-up by a butcher 
   and thrown into a fire, saves a Japanese girl (Jennifer Lim), who is 
   being blowtorched in the face (one of the most cringe-inducing scenes 
   in American cinema, as Paxton must cut off the Japanese girl's right 
   eye, which is hanging out of it's socket) by an American businessman (<A HREF="suits_tv_series.htm">Rick
    Hoffman</A>, who played the agent on <B><A HREF="bernie_mac_show_tv_series_2001-2006.htm">THE

   the lawyer we love to hate on <B><A HREF="suits_tv_series_2011.htm">SUITS</A></B> 
   [2011 - 2019]). They escape and a car chase begins which leads to the 
   death of the two complicit girls and the mole-lipped man (one of them<A HREF="hostel_2005.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hostel poster2 small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="127" HEIGHT="178" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   being run over graphically by her own team). When they get to the 
   train station, the Japanese girl sees her reflection in the glass and 
   throws herself in front of a train, splashing blood all over the 
   waiting passengers. Paxton gets on the train and sees the Dutch 
   businessman and follows him when he gets off the train into the men's 
   room. He cuts off the Dutch guy's two fingers with a scalpel, shoves 
   his head in the toilet and slashes his throat. THE END. The film 
   starts out with some really funny humor, especially from Oli, as the 
   guys party till they pass out and play jokes on each other. The jokes 
   end abruptly as soon as they reach the hostel and the gore comes 
   quickly soon after. There is so much blood in this film, that it 
   reminded me of director Nick Palumbo's <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Murder Set Pieces">MURDER-SET-P</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Murder Set Pieces">IECES</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">

   of the story and doesn't give us enough background of the main 
   characters to really care about their fate. The unrated DVD will put 
   you off traveling to any Slavik nation, as it is shown to be a dingy 
   place where all the cops are crooked and the children are a bunch of 
   bloodthirsty killers (they kill two guys in a car with bricks and 
   sticks after being bribed by Paxton with a bag of candy!). My wife 
   just sat there horrified at some of the scenes, covering her eyes at 
   certain places. I got a queasy feeling in my stomach while watching 
   this film. Neither one of us usually act like that. If this was what 
   Eli Roth was going for, all I have to say is: &quot;Bravo!&quot; On 
   the other hand, if he was trying to make a social statement he failed 
   miserably. If you like seeing people suffer, by all means rent or buy

    on some champagne he has drunk (he was probably drugged) and when he 
   wakes up in the hotel room with Carter and Justin, they find that 
   Mike is missing. They try calling Mike, but he has turned his phone 
   off (he doesn't want to take any calls from his nagging wife), so the 
   trio, with the help of a business card Nikki gave to Justin, try to 
   locate where Nikki lives, figuring Mike is staying with her for the 
   weekend. They locate Nikki's house. It is a mobile home at a trailer 
   park and when they break inside, they find nothing but roaches 
   crawling under a rug and a closet full of sex toys. As they are 
   leaving, they run into Kendra, who says Nikki is missing, too, so 
   they all try to find the pair. Little do they know that Mike and 
   Nikki were kidnapped by members of the Elite Hunting Club (the same 
   dastardly business in the first two films, who all adorn tattoos of a 
   bloodhound in a circle somewhere on their bodies, which act like keys 
   to open doors in their compound), where Mike is the first one to be 
   tortured. His is strapped to a chair and a curtain opens, where whe 
   see a bunch of rich people, led by Master of Ceremonies Flemming 
   (Thomas Kretschmann; <B><A HREF="grimm_love_2006.htm">GRIMM LOVE</A></B> 
   - 2006; <B><A HREF="transsiberian_2008.htm">TRANSSIBERIAN</A></B> - 
   2008), playing a game of &quot;Wheel Of Misfortune&quot; on their 
   laptops, where they win money if the wheel stops at a particular 
   torture that will be used on Mike. A torturer comes in dressed as a 
   doctor, threatens Mike with a power drill, puts a ball gag in Mike's 
   mouth, picks up a white mask, puts it on Mike's face, traces the 
   outline in grease pencil and then begins slicing Mike's face off with 
   a scalpel (graphic doesn't begin to describe it). The winners behind 
   the glass watching the action (both live and on large screen 
   monitors) clap and the losers moan. Next up is Nikki, who is strapped 
   to a table, sprayed with a sweet substance and has a whole lotta 
   roaches dumped on her body (You just know director Spiegel couldn't 
   resist a POV shot of the roaches crawling into Nikki's mouth!). 
   Flemming's right-hand man, Travis (Chris Coy; <B><A HREF="treme_hbo_series.htm">TREME</A></B> 
   [2010 - 2013]), takes a photo of Nikki's face (the roaches ate away 
   her insides, leaving her face looking normal) and then sends a text 
   on Mike's phone to the rest of his friends, telling them to meet him 
   and Nikki at Room 6 of a local hostel (he attaches the photo of Nikki 
   to prove that she is there with him), the same room where, in the 
   beginning of the film, Travis drugged the beer he gave to a married 
   Ukranian couple, Viktor (Nikola Shreli) and Anka (Evelina Oboza), and 
   had their drugged bodies taken away though a secret door located 
   behind a mirror in the bathroom. When Scott, Carter and Kendra 
   (Justin stays in the car because his leg hurts) get to the room, they 
   are gassed by members of Elite and put in the back of a black SUV. 
   Justin notices the act and tries to save them, but Travis gets the 
   upper hand and Justin joins his friends. When they all wake up, they 
   are in locked cages at the Elite facility, where they meet prisoner 
   Viktor (Anka has already been taken away and tortured to death 
   off-screen). Justin is the first to be tortured, strapped into a 
   chair while a female in a black leather getup and a strange mask 
   shoots numerous crossbow bolts into his body (including his 
   testicles). He dies without once screaming in pain, which not only 
   pisses off his torturer, but it also disappoints the audience 
   watching it. A major surprise (Warning: SPOILER!) awaits Scott and 
   Kendra when Carter reveals that he is a member of the Elite Hunting 
   Club (He sports the tattoo on his upper arm). Scott is picked to be 
   tortured next and his torturer is to be Carter. When Scott asks 
   Carter why he is doing this, he reveals that he is still in love with 
   Amy and says, &quot;When it comes to pussy, I have no friends!&quot; 
   He plans on killing Scott, consoling Amy and eventually becoming her 
   lover. When Carter begins preparing Scott for torture by chainsaw, 
   Flemming orders Travis to release the automatic metal restraints from 
   Scott's chair, making it more of a fair fight (Turns out that 
   Flemming doesn't care too much for Carter). Scott knocks out Carter 
   and cuts off his tattoo with a knife, using it as a key to get out of 
   the room. When Viktor gets free by electrocuting a guard with his own 
   cattle prod (He shoves the prod into the guard's mouth and lets her 
   rip!) and stealing the keys, he heads to the electrical room and 
   disables the electricity to the building with a few swings of an axe. 
   Viktor is shotgunned to death by another guard just as he plants the 
   axe into the guard's chest. Scott runs to the cages to free Kendra, 
   but she is shot dead by Travis, who chases Scott around the 
   incinerator room with a meat cleaver (there's a nasty shot where 
   Travis swings the cleaver, missing Scott, but cleaving the dead 
   Mike's skinless head in half). Scott gets the upper hand and kills 
   Travis with Justin's metal crutch (a fitting demise). Meanwhile, 
   Flemming has all his members leave the building and activates a 
   self-destruct sequence for the building. When Flemming gets into his 
   SUV, Carter is waiting in the back seat and stabs him to death, 
   stealing his car (Carter uses Flemming's dead body as a tire shield

   foot. When Carter notices Scott chasing him, he locks the compound's 
   gate behind him and the building blows up, killing Scott. The next 
   time we see Carter, he is consoling Amy in her living room, both of 
   them looking at Scott's urn on a mantle above the fireplace. Amy goes 
   to get some wine and when she comes back, she shoves a corkscrew into 
   Carters hand, pinning him to the table, while Scott suddenly appears 
   behind him, his face and head burned badly on one side, but still 
   very much alive. He and Amy tie up Carter in the garage, where they 
   kill him with a gas-powered garden tiller. Justice is done. Although 
   not as stomach-churning as the first two films (especially the 
   eyeball sequence in Part 1 and the penis-yanking in Part 2), director 
   Scott Spiegel (who also acted in such films as <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Dead Next Door">THE

   guessing, especially the surprise reveal two-thirds into the film. 
   The only problem I have with this film is that Thomas Kretschmann's 
   character is woefully underwritten. He doesn't have much to do except 
   tower over his fellow members or stick his head between the breasts 
   of one of his female workers. It's never revealed why he dislikes 
   Carter enough to put his whole enterprise in jeopardy by releasing 
   Scott during the torture session. Besides that one gaffe, <B><A HREF="hostel_part_3_2011b.htm">HOSTEL

   Doria) is looking for her boyfriend after using the abandoned house 
   for a place to have sex. She finds her boyfriend's mutilated body and

    A new family is moving into the Freudstein home: Lucy Boyle

   young girl peering out of one of the windows. When Lucy looks at the 
   photo, she is not there. Norman and his family are moving into the 
   house from New York City (where many Italian horror films from this 
   period start out) after a colleague, Peterson (whom we never see), 
   committed suicide while working on a top-secret &quot;project&quot; 
   (which is never fully explained). Norman is taking over the project 
   (Lucio Fulci maskes a cameo as &quot;Professor Muller&quot; as he and 
   Norman are walking down a NYC street discussing why he has to go to 
   Boston) and he is taking his family with him (not a good idea!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

   agent Laura Gittleson's (Dagmar Lassander; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackCat1981">THE
    BLACK CAT</A></B> - 1981) office to pick up the keys to their new

   with little girl Mary Freudstein (Silvia Collatina; <B><A HREF="#GreatAlligator">THE
    GREAT ALLIGATOR</A></B> - 1979), the little girl he saw in the 
   window of the photo, who may be a ghost (Earlier in the film, we see 
   Mary staring at a female mannequin in a store window, which then 
   loses its head when it falls down on a piece of broken window glass. 
   Why does the mannequin bleed?). Laura tells the Boyles that they will 
   have to follow her to their new home, since it is hard to find and in 
   the middle of the woods.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   visions. Ann (Ania Pieroni; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Tenebre1982">TENEBRE</A></B> 
   - 1982), their new nanny, looks exactly like the headless mannequin 
   (Why is Lucy having the same visions as Mary?). Norman has set up an 
   office in their new home and, that night, he hears a child crying, 
   but when he checks up on Bob, he finds him sound asleep. He then 
   hears Lucy trying to pry open the boards blocking the basement door 
   (What's behind the door?).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next morning, Norman goes to the local library, where he talks 
   to librarian Daniel Douglas (Gianpaolo Saccarola; <B><A HREF="beyond_1981.htm">THE
    BEYOND</A></B> - 1981). Daniel has some papers belonging to his late 
   colleague Peterson, who was doing research on Dr. Freudstein. Daniel 
   then tells Norman that Peterson hanged himself in this very library 
   (he shows him where). While cleaning the hallway, Lucy discovers a 
   stone grave marker under a rug that belongs to Jacob &amp; Tess 
   Freudstein (Why were they buried inside the house?). Lucy then hears 
   someone (or something) trying to break free from the tomb. She also 
   hears other noises, such as a child crying, that makes her scream in 
   terror. When Norman gets home, he discovers Lucy cowering in the 
   hallway, crying. He then decides to open the basement door to prove 
   to Lucy that there is nothing evil down there. After having problems 
   opening the door (the lock is nearly rusted shut), he is able to go 
   downstairs to the basement, where he finds a mens gold wedding ring 
   (he puts it in his pocket). Almost immediately, he and Lucy are 
   attacked by a very angry bat and Norman must use a pair of scissors 
   to stab the bat to get it off his hand (The blood from the bat 
   spraying on Lucy and Bob's faces). Norman and Lucy then go to Laura's 
   office to ask for a new place to live, but Laura's assistant tells 
   them she is not there (she is). Later on, Laura goes to see Norman 
   and Lucy to see what the problem is (She has been getting plenty of 
   complaints from previous residents), but when she gets to the house, 
   no one is there (that she knows about). While Laura is looking for 
   the Boyles, she steps on the stone grave marker, breaks it and a 
   grunting and moaning figure stabs her in the chest and neck with a 
   large metal spike (very graphic) and drags her bloody body down to 
   the basement. The next morning, we see Ann cleaning the blood off the 
   floor (<B>Lucy:</B> &quot;What are you doing?&quot; <B>Ann:</B> 
   &quot;I made coffee!&quot;).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Meanwhile, Norman does some research on Dr. Freudstein and discovers 
   that he was an early-20th Century doctor with a &quot;penchant for 
   illegal experiments&quot; and gets a cassette tape from Daniel where 
   we hear Peterson say &quot;Blood! Blood! I can hear it 
   everywhere!&quot; (WTF?!?). Norman tells Lucy that he will have to 
   make a short trip to NYC to do some further research.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see Bob playing with Mary in a cemetery next to the house 
   (we see Mary's gravestone). Then we see Bob playing with a remote-controlled
    car inside the house and loses it when it accidentally falls into 
   the basement, so he goes down to collect it. Ann goes down to the 
   cellar to look for Bob and the door locks behind her. Someone (or 
   something) slices her throat over and over with a butcher knife 
   (another very gory scene). Bob, who is not in the basement, goes 
   looking for Ann in the basement and discovers her decapitated head 
   (just like Mary &amp; Lucy's vision). When Lucy gets home from food 
   shopping, she finds Bob crying in his bedroom. He tells his mother 
   what he saw, so Lucy goes down in the basement and finds nothing.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Norman is now at a cemetery in New York City looking for the tomb of 
   Dr. Freudstein (What about the marker in the hallway?), but the 
   cemetery caretaker (Elmer Johnsson) tells Norman that Dr. Freudstein 
   is not buried there and he is not the only person to make that 
   mistake (What could this possibly mean?).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    That night, Bob goes down to the basement (<B>Bob:</B> &quot;Ann?

   glowing pair of eyes staring back at him. He runs up the stairs, only 
   to find the door locked. Lucy tries to open the door, but breaks the 
   key off in the lock. Norman shows up and breaks the door down with an 
   axe (A hand holds Bob's head to the door hoping the axe blade will 
   slice into his head and split his skull open, but no such luck). We 
   then discover the mutated corpse of Dr. Freudstein lives in the 
   basement (Bob discovers the bloody corpses of Ann and Laura hanging 
   from the rafters). Norman stabs Dr. Freudstein with a knife (maggots 
   come pouring out of the wound) before it rips Norman's throat with 
   its bare hands <A HREF="house_by_the_cemetery_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/house by the cemetery ad mat11 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(another
    memorable scene). Lucy and Bob try to escape through the cracked 
   grave marker, but Dr. Freudstein drags Lucy to her death. Just when 
   it looks like curtains for Bob, Mary lifts him out of the grave 
   marker and Mrs. Freudstein takes him outside. Is Bob dead? It's hard 
   to say, as the film ends with this quotation: <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;No

    </B>Like I said in the beginning of this review, the film makes very 
   little sense, but the gore flows rather freely. There is no 
   explanation on why Dr. Freudstein looks the way he does, or even if 
   it is Dr. Freudstein at all, except to say that he was fond of 
   &quot;illegal experiments&quot;. What sort of illegal experiments? I 
   guess we can only speculate, as the film offers us no explanations. 
   The screenplay, by Fulci, Giorgio Mariuzzo (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Contraband1980">CONTRABAND</A></B> 
   - 1980) &amp; Dardano Sacchetti (<B><A HREF="#Devil Fish">DEVIL FISH</A></B>

   - 1985) tips its hat to H.P. Lovecraft, but I believe even ol' H.P. 
   would be scratching his head trying to figure it out. To show you how 
   confusing this film really is, when Vestron Video released this on 
   VHS, they showed two reels of film out of order and very few people 
   noticed! Lucio Fulci does give this film a nice atmospheric sheen, 
   which was one of the things he was a master at. The exteriors were 
   filmed in Concord, Massachusetts, but all the interiors were shot at 
   the De Paolis Studios in Rome, Italy. The fact that they do not look 
   like sets, imbues this film with a dark tone that only Fulci could 
   pull off. It may not make any sense, but it is a great film to look at.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   2003 from Legacy Entertainment and a widescreen uncut version on DVD 
   from <A HREF="http://anchorbayentertainment.com">Anchor Bay Entertainment</A> 
   followed, but the beautiful-looking Blu-Ray from <A HREF="http://www.blue-underground.com">Blue
    Underground</A> is the only way to view this film. I saw it 
   theatrically in the mid-'80s and I can honestly say that the Blu-Ray 
   looks better. The extras on the Blu-Ray are second-to-none, as there 
   is a great original featurette called &quot;Meet The Boyles&quot; 
   where the lovely Catriona MacColl and the rugged Paolo Malco 
   reminisce about making this film. They recall Fulci as always yelling 
   on set, being a bit of a sadist to his actors and not liking 
   children. On another extra on the disc, an interview with the adult 
   Giovanni Frezza, he seems to back up their claims. I especially like 
   the TV trailer for this film, where Brother Theodore narrates in his 
   typical overwrought manner, making the film seem more sinister than 
   it actually is. I remember seeing this trailer on TV and love that it 
   was included here (there is also an international trailer and the 
   U.S. theatrical trailer included on the disc). Also on the disc is an 
   extended scene of the bat attack, which has never been seen before. I 
   applaud Blue Underground for giving this film the deluxe treatment 
   and urge everyone to buy this disc. Also starring Carlo De Mejo (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#TerrorExpress1979">TERROR

   promising and well-photographed beginning, this gory horror film 
   quickly degenerates, thanks to some truly amateur acting and long 
   stretches of boredom (at 102 minutes, this film runs at least twenty 
   minutes too long). A busload of prisoners on their way to a jail in 
   Seattle (this was actually filmed in Germany and Austria) crashes 
   into a car driven by Dr. Douglas Madsen (Christopher Kriesa; <B><A HREF="#Dentist">THE
    DENTIST</A></B> - 1996), which allows four prisoners to escape, kill 
   their guards (one has his head blown off with a shotgun blast, 
   another is shot point-blank between the eyes and still another has 
   his face torn apart at the jaw line) and take Douglas as a hostage as 
   they trek by foot towards the Canadian border. They have to find 
   shelter soon because Spence (Luca Maric), the brother of hot-headed 
   escapee Arthur Palmer (Simon Newby), has a bullet in his arm that 
   needs immediate removal before the wound gets infected and Spence 
   loses his arm or, worse, his life. As the quintet, which also 
   includes Vincenzo (Mehmet Yilmaz) and Stephen (Jaymes Butler), travel 
   deeper into the woods, they stumble upon a cabin occupied by a 
   strange family that speak in an Olde English dialect (lots of 
   &quot;thees&quot;, &quot;yees&quot; and words that end in 
   &quot;est&quot;). Arthur and the cons take the family hostage and, 
   thanks to Arthur's stupidity and anger, that <A HREF="house_of_blood_2005.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/house of blood dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="199" HEIGHT="286" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>results
    in the loss of Douglas' medical bag, Douglas is forced to amputate 
   Spence's arm the old-fashioned way, using the strange family's 
   collection of hammers and knives and fire to cauterize the open 
   wound. Family member Alice (Martina Ittenbach; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#DardDivorce">DARD
    DIVORCE</A></B> - 2007), who was spotted earlier bleeding a goat and 
   using some strange black paste, assists Douglas in the amputation 
   while the rest of her family prays and young girl Karen (Lisa 
   Sachsenweger) begins growling like a dog. While Spence hovers between 
   life and death, the other three cons and Douglas begin to notice that 
   this family and their cabin are downright deadly (Maybe it was the 
   chains on the walls and ropes on the beds that tipped them off?). It 
   turns out that the family is a bunch of indestructible ghouls (When 
   Arthur blows one of their heads off, it grows back!), who make 
   mincemeat out of all the cons, but Douglas escapes into the woods 
   with Alice's help. Douglas is rescued by a SWAT team looking for the 
   cons and when he is questioned by a police detective (an extended 
   cameo by Jurgen Prochnow; <B><A HREF="house_of_the_dead_2003.htm">HOUSE
    OF THE DEAD</A></B> - 2003), Douglas has a flashback to his 
   childhood (Alice may actually be his mother!) and he refuses to 
   cooperate. Douglas is then arrested, becomes a prisoner and is 
   shipped off to jail on a bus on the same route as the first fateful 
   bus. It's deja-vu all over again, as the bus crashes on nearly the 
   same spot and Douglas leads a new group of four prisoners to the same 
   cabin in the woods, like lambs to the slaughter. Is it possible that 
   this is Douglas' pre-ordained mission in life? You'll find out if you 
   make it to the film's long-overdue finale.&nbsp; This horror film is 
   basically nothing but the same story told twice, with brief bits of 
   ultra-gore thrown in to keep the viewer awake. 
   Director/co-screenwriter Olaf Ittenbach (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Burning Moon">THE
    BURNING MOON</A></B> - 1992; <B><A HREF="legion_of_the_dead_2001.htm">LEGION

    THE LIMITS</A></B> - 2003) offers some interesting visual touches 
   (including a nice shock cut involving a picture frame in the film's 
   opening minutes) and camera setups (the cause of the first crash, a 
   chain reaction where a dead bird falls out of a tree, dislodges a 
   rock, which rolls downhill and crashes into Douglas' windshield, is 
   very well done and creepy, to boot), but the acting talent of the 
   cast (Kriesel and Prochnow excluded), especially Martina Ittenbach 
   and pug-nosed Dan Van Husen as Paul, the leader of the second group 
   of escaped cons, is simply atrocious and drags the film down into the 
   pit of mediocrity. I'm still trying to figure out why director 
   Ittenbach chose to set this film in the Seattle area, since the 
   majority of the actors speak with thick German accents. The gore on 
   view is very graphic (especially in the Unrated edition; it's also 
   available in a toned-down R-Rated edition, but why bother?), 
   including head explosions, a nasty arm amputation, flesh eating, 
   multiple bloody bullet squibs and other extreme scenes (including an 
   operation on a con's testicle), but there are long stretches of 
   painful-to-watch dialogue sequences between those gory bits. While 
   Ittenbach has definitely progressed from his SOV roots, he really 
   needs tighter scripts and better actors to achieve more watchable 
   films. <B><A HREF="house_of_blood_2005b.htm">HOUSE OF BLOOD</A></B>

   it really needed to reign-in all that bad dialogue and the amateurs

   though. Quite the opposite; some of them die very gory deaths. It 
   should also be noted that the first half hour seems like a long 
   commercial for the theme park (showing the establishment's name on 
   screen on a black background a few times and Tim Bunch giving a 
   real-life interview to a Buffalo news reporter), but then all that 
   bullshit stops and we get to the meat of the story. A building code 
   inspector, Doug (Doug Brunch), comes to the House Of Horrors to 
   perform his yearly code inspection. He sees employee Kage (Kyle 
   Garrison) working on a bloody corpse prop and the Doug says he's more 
   of a Christmas guy than a Halloween one (the cross hanging around his 
   neck is a dead give-away). Since Doug stands around 6'6&quot;, is 
   bald and well-built, Kage offers him a job as one of the park's 
   psychos, but he politely turns him down. Kyle leaves the building to 
   do some business, leaving Doug to do his thing. Almost immediately, 
   the electricity goes out and Doug has to use a flashlight to traverse 
   the haunted house's many hallways, being scared to death by all the 
   theme parks bloody mechanized killers and one of them calls Doug by 
   his name (At that time, I would have shit my pants and beat a hasty 
   retreat, but Doug continues his inspection). He enters room after 
   room of bloody haunted house goodness, but then hears a young child 
   laugh and goes to investigate (My underwear would be sagging down to 
   my knees trying to hold all the shit that was coming out of my ass). 
   Doug enters a room where a mechanized female in a rocking chair is 
   sitting with the skin missing from the lower half of her face, but 
   then the rocking chair stops (At this point, my white crew socks 
   would have turned brown). He takes a closer look at the woman sitting 
   on the chair and she suddenly springs in front of Doug's face and he 
   notices the room is full of dismembered dolls' heads mounted on the 
   walls (This is the time that my socks would have turned green, from 
   my pee mixing in with my now-brown socks, with me then fainting and 
   passed out in my urine and shit-filled clothes). Doug then finds a 
   room with an eerie Satanic altar (it doesn't look like it has been 
   touched for years, as it is full of real cobwebs, not the fake 
   spray-on kind) and we immediately know he is in trouble because we 
   see a red P.O.V. shot taken from his back (Hmmm. I wonder what 
   creature loves the color red?). Doug touches the altar and then he 
   immediately rubs the crucifix around his neck and runs for his life, 
   only to have his huge frame flung through the air and attach itself 
   to the top of a large wall like Jesus on the Cross (It's a 
   well-executed scene). He then burns to death when a large bolt of 
   fire appears (one of the few examples of CGI). Dusty (Michael Riso) 
   is the man put in charge by Tim and he gathers all his employees 
   together and tells them they have a month to build two haunted houses 
   inside this giant warehouse and says the theme this year will be 
   &quot;The Gates Of Hell&quot;. He assigns everyone a particular task. 
   Dusty puts Kage in charge of making sure everything gets done on time 
   and like all groups there is one dickhead, this one mentioning to Art 
   Director Jamie (Danielle Tewell) that she is a psychic and hopes she 
   doesn't blow her brains out like her mother did. We then see Father 
   Michaels (Michael O'Hear; the only actor returning from the first 
   film in the same role) watching the head of Jesus blow off the 
   desktop statue of the deity crucified on the cross, just as the 
   second hand of his wall clock stops. We then see a newspaper article 
   hanging on the wall with a photo of him, the headline saying 
   &quot;PRIEST ADMITS TO SEVERAL SUICIDE ATTEMPTS&quot;. Father Michael 
   is not your normal priest, as his office is in the back of a strip 
   club, he has written a book on demonology and makes a living by 
   charging not just an outrageous price for his book, but also holds 
   seminars telling people that Hell, in fact, doesn't really exist 
   (He's a complicated man, who is still a priest, but is a man of 
   mystery). We then see an 80's-like montage scene of all the workers 
   getting the two houses ready while some heavy metal music plays. 
   Jamie is always being drawn into the Satanic altar room, like some 
   force is pulling her there. Colin (Steve Podosek) is in charge of 
   taking photos of the progress of the houses daily (for their yearly 
   brochure) and he and Dusty look at the slides he took (they see a 
   topless girl in one of the photos, bump fists and Dusty tells Colin 
   to &quot;print it'). Dusty sees a slide of Tim giving the camera the 
   middle finger but notices something strange in the background (I had 
   to freeze the frame to see that there is something like a red eye 
   staring through a hole in the wall over Tim's right shoulder), so he 
   tells Colin to &quot;print it&quot;. The air conditioning in the 
   building goes out and Tim tells Kage to go to the roof and fix it. As 
   Kage is going there, he sees Doug's burned inspection report, while 
   we see someone adds an object to the Satanic altar. As Kage is on the 
   roof trying to get the air conditioning unit to work (it takes a kick 
   to get it working), he hears the same child's laugh that Doug did 
   earlier in the film. Something unseen (with a red P.O.V.) chases Kage 
   across the roof and a bolt of fire hits him until there is nothing 
   left but a skeleton with a little flesh on the ribcage. Someone 
   dressed in a creepy clown costume kills a female employee by stabbing 
   her in the vagina with a machete while in a bathroom (we see the 
   offal fall into one of the toilets). In the film's most comedic 
   scene, maintenance man Pops (Ronald &quot;Pops&quot; Garrison), 
   brings in a pretty girl to audition for one of the roles in the 
   Halloween show. Even though the girl doesn't have a car, can't scream 
   and can't act, she has great set of breasts, so everyone gives her a 
   &quot;10&quot;, even though her &quot;scariness factor&quot; is below 
   a &quot;0&quot;. Jamie, Dusty and Colin discover blood on the wall 
   next to Kage's shirt and hat and call Tim, but he tells them Kage is 
   fucking with them and to ignore it. Dusty and Colin go to a lecture 
   by Father Michaels to show him the photos, while Jamie traverses the 
   woods and finds a small cabin hidden there. Inside the cabin is a 
   nearly hairless creepy old woman who said she knew Jamie's mother. 
   The old woman warns Jamie that the Satanic altar is actually a lock 
   to the actual Gates of Hell and if it becomes unlocked, there will 
   literally be Hell on Earth. The old lady then disappears into thin 
   air. Father Michaels is very disinterested in Dusty and Colin's 
   photos (and the fact that they didn't spend $50 for his book!) until 
   he sees a photo of the Satanic altar, and he also tells Dusty and 
   Colin that the altar must not be unlocked. Back at the haunted house, 
   a man wearing a human skin face mask repeatedly shocks a tied-up girl 
   with a cattle prod, she being unable to scream because her mouth is 
   sealed with duct tape (Someone should really do an article about duct 
   tape being used in horror films, because it is one of the most-used 
   horror tropes, even beating the opening of films that use old 
   newspaper articles to fill the audience in on the history of a town 
   or person). When the killer removes the duct tape, blood comes 
   pouring out of the woman's mouth, but she is still alive and just 
   unconscious (The killer eventually lubes-up a hand grenade and shoves 
   it up her hoo-haa and we watch it explode as the killer enjoys a good 
   cigar).Two security guards are watching the cameras, when they see a 
   figure in the Satanic altar room, so the older guy sends the younger 
   girl guard to go check it out, but the killer enters the security 
   office and kills the old man by bashing his head in.<A HREF="house_of_horrors_the_gates_of_hell_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("191","299") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/house of horrors gates of hell poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="191" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Since the cast is dwindling, we have to ask ourselves who is the 
   person that can unlock the Satanic altar (it's someone we all know). 
   How many more people will die before we find out if the altar will be 
   unlocked or stay locked? Colin finds a homemade DVD that is full of a 
   worker's &quot;best-of&quot; compilations of his kills (we see a 
   auditioning girl get shot in the head and another girl having a spike 
   hammered in her eye) and that person blows off Colin's head with a 
   shotgun (probably the film's best effect). Someone dressed in a 
   creepy creature costume decapitates Dusty. Father Michaels shows up 
   at the haunted house and shoots Tim (yes, Tim is the killer) and then 
   hands the gun to Jamie. We think Jamie is going to shoot herself in 
   the head, but she shoots Father Michaels, because he is actually an 
   evil person who knew how to open the altar. Jamie walks out of the 
   House Of Horrors alone, but she has actually opened the Satanic altar 
   by killing Father Michaels (the whole place breaks out in CGI fire 
   and we all know that CGI fire looks about as real as a Playboy 
   model's tits), as the old hairless woman appears and thanks Jamie for 
   being so stupid and gullible. The Devil and his many minions appear 
   in the fire and Jamie then shoots herself in the head, while the old 
   woman says, &quot;Like mother, like daughter.&quot; Evil wins once 
   again.&nbsp; There's not much I can say about this film that I 
   haven't already said, except to mention that there are some welcomed 
   sight gags (instead of the internet search engine being called 
   &quot;Yahoo&quot;, it is called &quot;Yippie&quot;) and one liners 
   (Colin tells Dusty to go to Tim's house to search for something 
   because &quot;Tim's at a Gwar concert and he will be there for a 
   while.&quot;). The makeup and special effects are all above par and 
   make most Hollywood films look like amateurs. A lot of care went into 
   making these props because they were meant to scare real people. The 
   decapitations are excellent (Watch Colin's frame-by-frame to see 
   where they substituted the real Colin for the fake one; it's almost 
   as good as the head explosion in <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#ChoppingMall1986">CHOPPING
    MALL</A></B> - 1986), but most of the gory violence is just kept 
   off-screen (We don't see Tim stab the girl in the crotch, but we see 
   the after-effects. Same for the grenade blowing up inside the girl's 
   vagina.). The Satanic altar plot is a little far-fetched and 
   confusing (Exactly what unlocked the altar? Father Michael's death? 
   If that is what opened it, how?), but you have to admire Tim Bunch 
   for showing his establishment in a less than flattering light. I know 
   they are only playing fictional caricatures of themselves, but Tim 
   and his staff do a good job of pulling it off. This is also a 
   thousand times better than any other film released by Brain Damage 
   Films, as they are known for releasing SOV dreck I wouldn't let my 
   dog take a crap on. This film, on the other hand, is professionally 
   made and is entertaining, once you get past the self-promotion bits 
   during the first 30 minutes. I can think of a lot worse ways of 
   spending 91 minutes and if you are a fan of haunted Halloween houses 
   and how they operate, this will also give you some more entertainment 
   value. We need films like this every once in a while so we can put 
   our brain in neutral, but this is still tasty cotton candy for the 
   mind. Also starring Brenda Richart, Codie Kremblas; Danielle LaBelle,

   vile clan.&nbsp; Needless to say, the two couples are subjected to 
   every type of torture imaginable, dying in horrible ways that you 
   have to see to believe. There's always a feeling of dread permeating 
   this film as director Zombie mixes film, videotape, documentary-like 
   footage, solarization and quick cuts to induce fear into the viewer. 
   My favorite moment of the film is the cringe-inducing scene when Otis 
   holds a gun to the head of Officer Naish (Walt Goggins of <B><A HREF="shield_tv_series_2002-2008.htm">THE
    SHIELD</A></B> [2002 - 2008]) as the camera pans up for what seems 
   like an eternity. You know what's going to happen, but not when. When 
   it does happen, it's guaranteed to make you jump. There are some 
   mistakes this film makes (such as the jump in logic of some scenes, 
   probably due to editing for an R rating), but don't let that deter 
   you from buying this DVD. You'll watch it many times. There are many 
   extras on the disc as well as some well-hidden Easter Eggs starring 
   Captain Spaulding, Otis and Baby filmed expressly for this DVD. The 
   menu sections are a hoot and one of the extra features called 
   &quot;Tiny Fucks A Stump&quot; is so funny I was actually crying. 
   Unfortunately this is the R-rated cut of the film as Rob Zombie was 
   too busy to put the cut parts back in, due to prior commitments, but 
   there's enough red stuff and good music (used to terriffic effect) to 
   satisfy any gorehound. More DVDs should be as entertaining as this, 
   as the menus and special features show special care and a true 
   appreciation for the horror genre. Run out and get ths DVD!!! Cameo

   (Andy J. Forest; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#MarkOfTheScorpion">MARK OF 
   THE SCORPION</A></B> - 1986) having a recurring nightmare where he is 
   being chased by a pack of dogs (we hear them, but never see them) 
   down a long tree and hedge-lined road until he gets to the gates of a 
   secluded house, which magically open and let him in. Once in the 
   house, Luke spots an ugly witch (Maria Clementine Cumani Quasimodo; 
   wow, that's a mouthful!), who is cooking something in her cauldron 
   and beckons him to come nearer. He does just that (that's right, he's 
   an idiot!) and watches as she throws his decapitated head into the 
   cast iron pot and begins stirring, at which point Luke always wakes 
   up. Luke is under the care of psychiatrist Dr. Elsa Palmer (Susanna 
   Martinkpva), his sister-in-law (she was married to Luke's brother, 
   who died in a<A HREF="house_of_witchcraft_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/house of witchcraft british vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="167" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   car crash), who tries to help him make these nightmares stop, but all 
   she is able to gather is that these nightmares started six months 
   earlier, when Luke married Martha (Sonia Petrovna). Luke also tells 
   Elsa that Martha is obsessed with the occult sciences and spends 
   entire nights studying tarot cards and the symbols of the Kabbalah. 
   Luke believes that Martha is not normal (duh!) and he would probably 
   be better off if they never married, because she scares him (double 
   duh!). Luke and Martha decide to give their marriage one last chance, 
   so Martha rents a house in the country to work with Luke on 
   rebuilding their relationship. You don't need to be a bright bulb to 
   know how this is going to turn out. As they are driving in the 
   country, a car coming in the opposite direction suddenly loses 
   control, nearly hits them and then flips over. Luke tells Martha to 
   stop the car, but all she will say is, &quot;It's no use. They're 
   dead.&quot; Luke makes her stop the car anyway and, sure enough, both 
   men in the other car are dead and Martha tells Luke to get back in 
   the car before the police arrive. When Luke and Martha arrive at the 
   country house, Luke is surprised to discover that it is the same 
   house as in his nightmares (At this point in the film, I would have 
   demanded Martha drive me back to civilization, but we all know that 
   never happens in films like this.). Luke and Martha meet the house's 
   owner, blind concert pianist Andrew Mason (Paul Muller), who informs 
   them that his niece, Sharon (Marina Giulia Cavalli), will also be 
   staying in the house. That night, Luke looks out his bedroom window 
   and sees the ugly witch of his nightmares killing a priest. When he 
   goes outside to investigate, all he finds is Sharon arriving and 
   Martha walking around in a trance in her nightgown with a nasty gash 
   on her hand. Feeling overwhelmed (and probably too stupid to describe 
   in words), Luke phones Elsa and begs her to come to the house, but 
   before she does, Luke is attacked by feathers (!) in one bedroom and 
   a seemingly possessed Martha nearly runs-over Andrew's seeing-eye dog 
   and Sharon with her car. Andrew tells Luke that years before, a 
   skeleton was found behind one of the walls of the house and he 
   believes it was the body of the witch. When Luke goes to talk to the 
   local priest, he finds out that the priest was murdered the night 
   before, just like he saw it (triple duh!). Luke finally realizes that 
   he is now living his nightmare in real life, but can he unravel the 
   mystery before his severed head ends up in the witch's cauldron?&nbsp;
    This is a rather dry supernatural horror film that shows its Italian 
   TV roots (they still could get away with more on TV in 1989 than we 
   in the U.S. could have ever hoped for). While there is a dollop of 
   gore here and there, it in no way reaches the blood/gore ratio of 
   Italian genre theatrical films, including this film's 
   director/screenwriter Umberto Lenzi's similarly-themed <B><A HREF="#Ghosthouse 1987">GHOSTHOUSE</A></B>

   much blood and gore in this film, such as the scene where the witch 
   attacks Steven (Alberto Frasca) with a pair of hedge clippers. Not 
   once do we see the clippers enter the body, only brief glimpses of 
   Steven's bloody sweater. There's also one of the most bloodless 
   decapitations ever committed to film, something that would make even 
   Andy Milligan proud! Lenzi's script offers no surprises, just all the 
   usual haunted house cliches (furniture and objects moving or breaking 
   by themselves; the electricity going kaput at the worst possible 
   time; doors opening and closing on their own; secret passages; etc.) 
   and none of it is helped by the flat, monotonous English dubbing. <B><A HREF="house_of_witchcraft_1989b.htm">THE

   One of the better early-80's slasher films, thanks to tight 
   direction, a good script and effective performances. The prologue 
   opens on June 19, 1961, where a doctor rushes into the home of

   sorority girls are about to graduate college and move out of their 
   sorority house. Seven sorority girls, including virginal Katey Rose 
   (Kathryn McNeil), plan on having one final blowout party at the 
   house, <A HREF="house_on_sorority_row_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/house on sorority row poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="222" HEIGHT="320" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>but
    the house's strict den mother, who happens to be the now middle-aged 
   Dorothy Slater (Lois Kelso Hunt), wants the girls out of the house 
   immediately (for reasons not yet made clear). Sorority girl Vicki 
   (Eileen Davidson) decides to play a practical joke on Mrs. Slater 
   when she catches Vicki and her boyfriend Rick (Michael Sergio) 
   screwing in Vicki's bedroom (Mrs. Slater uses her cane to puncture a 
   hole in Vicki's waterbed). The prank goes terribly wrong when Vicki 
   threatens Mrs. Slater with a gun she thinks is loaded with blanks. 
   Unfortunately, someone put real bullets in the gun and Mrs. Slater is 
   shot dead. The girls dump her body (over Katey's protests) in the 
   house's unkempt outdoor pool (the water is dark green and full of 
   leaves and debris because Mrs. Slater refused to pay for its upkeep), 
   with plans of removing the body once the blowout party is over. 
   During the party, some unknown person begins murdering the guests 
   (mostly by using Mrs. Slater's cane) and hiding the bodies. Is it 
   possible that Mrs. Slater is still alive (her body turns out to be 
   missing from the pool) or is someone close to her responsible for the 
   murders? What does Dr. Nelson Beck (Christopher Laurence), the same 
   doctor responsible for delivering Mrs. Slater's stillborn baby twenty 
   years earlier, know about all this and why is he fretting over a 
   bunch of x-rays showing someone with psychotic brain deterioration? 
   As the sorority house girls and their party guests begin meeting 
   their maker in gory ways, Katey and new boyfriend Peter (Michael 
   Kuhn) try to unravel the deadly mystery. They discover a child's 
   bedroom in the attic of the house, which holds clues to the killer's 
   identity, but once Dr, Beck shows up at the house, things take a 
   bizarre turn as he tries to capture the killer alive, using Katey as 
   bait. What kind of doctor is he anyway?&nbsp; Director/screenwriter

   (he also produced this film with John G. Clark) in turning what 
   should be a routine slasher flick into something quite involving and 
   effective. Though not particularly gory, the murders and nonetheless 
   nasty and upsetting, as the unknown assailant impales the girls and 
   party guests with Mrs. Slater's cane; in the head, neck, hand, 
   stomach and other parts of the body (there's even a decapitated head

   together a great cast of female actors, including McNeil, Davidson,

   whose daughter, Kim (Danielle Weeks), is dating Matt, which 
   disappoints him because he's also Canco's publicity director. A 
   series of ocean attacks and boating &quot;accidents&quot; are at 
   first attributed to a rogue shark (Wade is hoping it's the same shark 
   that attacked him [leaving the right side of his body badly scarred] 
   so he can get revenge), but when Kim and a bunch of skinny-dipping

   only one not recovered. Matt also has an incriminating videotape 
   exposing Taylor's dumping operation and Taylor would do anything to 
   retrieve the tape, including murder. Wade believes Matt's monster 
   story after witnessing first-hand one of the creatures relieving a 
   poor fisherman of one of his legs, so he saves Matt's life when

   who tells them the creatures are actually five death row inmates that 
   were genetically altered in some top-secret experiment to turn them 
   into super soldiers for the government. The experiment was deemed a 
   failure, but the creatures escaped before they could be destroyed 
   (hence, the beginning of the film) and have found their way to Harbor 
   Shores, where the hormone-spiked waters have not only made them 
   stronger, but also hornier for the female of the human species. When 
   one of the female victims escapes from the creature, stumbles into a 
   bar and gives birth to a baby creature, it gives Wade hope that Kim 
   is still alive. Can Wade get over his fear of the water so he can

   the arrival of government soldiers inhibit Wade's search for Kim? If

    Gotho is picked-on constantly, by the medical interns in the 
   hospital (who make fun of his love for Ilsa) and the schoolkids who 
   throw rocks at him when he walks down the street. When Ilsa dies, he 
   kills two morgue attendants who try to steal Ilsa's crucifix necklace 
   (he lops the head off one attendant with an axe and slits open the 
   stomach of the other, spilling his guts on the floor). He steals 
   Ilsa's corpse and brings it to his underground lair and then goes 
   about killing those responsible for making his life miserable. While 
   he is strangling an intern at the hospital a pack of rats is feasting 
   on Ilsa's body. When he comes back to the lair and find the rats 
   chowing down on his love, he sets the rats on fire (WARNING: Scenes 
   of real rats on fire!) and moves Ilsa's rat-bitten body to a safer 
   location, a hidden ancient torture chamber in a subterraneous cave. 
   Gotho asks a scientist, Professor Orla (Alberto Dalbes), to help him 
   &quot;wake up&quot; Ilsa and, when he sees Gotho's underground lair, 
   facetiously agrees under the condition that Gotho allows him to use 
   the underground lair for his illicit and illegal experiments 
   involving human corpses. After getting the cave ready for the 
   Professor (including the installation of a sulphuric acid pit to 
   dissolve unused body parts), Ilsa's body is thrown into the acid pit 
   by three callous workers. Gotho goes bonkers and kills them all but 
   is calmed down by the Professor who promises Gotho he will build him 
   a new female friend as long as Gotho supplies him with fresh bodies 
   to experiment on, even if it involves murder. Poor Gotho does the 
   Professor's bidding and the Professor creates a creature (which he 
   calls a &quot;Primordial&quot;) which eventually gets loose and 
   spells doom for everyone involved.&nbsp; This bloody Spanish 
   production has me divided. It's extremely bloody (one scene involving 
   the removal of a head is rumored to have been performed on an actual 
   corpse, but I sincerely doubt it) and well-made, but I fail to see 
   the point of it all. The screenplay (co-scripted by Naschy using his 
   real name, Jacinto Molina) wants you to feel sorry for Gotho, yet he 
   murders numerous people for no other reason than because the 
   Professor said to. While the Professor is made out to be the real 
   villian, he actually kills no one. The sight of actual rats set on 
   fire and running around squealing in pain is also a turn-off. 
   Director Javier Aquirre (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CountDraculasLove">COUNT
    DRACULA'S GREAT LOVE</A></B> - 1972), much to his credit, does pull 
   off some of the graphic killings with a certain amount of panache, as 
   this is one of Naschy's bloodiest Spanish films and that's saying a 
   lot. The dubbing, though, is atrocious, as the voice actor who dubbed 
   Naschy is about three pitches too high, making him sound more comical 
   than frightening. Still, there's plenty of the red stuff and enough 
   atmosphere to appease horror fans. The print I viewed, from <A HREF="http://www.midnight1.com">Midnight

   (1984). It contains my opinions on why Fred Olen Ray's 80's films are

   movies, including Fred's own <B><A HREF="#DeepSpace">DEEP SPACE</A></B> 
   (1987). It's quite distracting at times because the recycled footage is<A HREF="hybrid_1997.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hybrid dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="233" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>

   in. Let's just say if you're a fan of <B><A HREF="damnation_alley_1978.htm">DAMNATION
    ALLEY</A></B> (1977), you won't be disappointed. Lucky for us, they 
   ditch the vehicle early on (probably because they ran out of usable 
   footage). Secondly, this film is a remake of David DeCoteau's <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Creepozoids1987">CREEPOZOIDS</A></B> 
   (1987). Fucking <B><A HREF="creepozoids_1987b.htm">CREEPOZOIDS</A></B> 
   for fuck's sake! Better decisions have been made on the deck of the 
   Titanic. You can't make a remake of a film which really didn't have a 
   story to begin with (Don't get me wrong, I love the original). In the 
   year 2069, a group of doctors and technicians, headed by Dr. Paul 
   Hamilton (John Barrymore III), are trekking through the desert 
   looking for shelter before a deadly ion storm hits (I hate when that 
   happens). They stumble upon a deserted research facility where they 
   find the mangled corpses of the previous occupants. With the ion 
   storm rapidly approaching, the ragtag group are forced to stay there. 
   The problem is they are not alone. An alien creature is roaming the 
   halls, looking to make mincemeat of the men and baby recepticles of 
   the women. Two military men, McQueen (Tim Abell) and Sgt. Frank 
   Blaine (good old Orville Ketchum himself: Peter Spellos, using the 
   screen name &quot;G. Gordon Baer&quot;) are the only line of defense 
   between them and the alien (played by Fred's son, Christopher Ray). 
   There's also a subplot about a hidden cache of stolen gold that is 
   all but forgotten about when the film ends. That's about it, 
   folks.&nbsp; By this point in his career, Fred Olen Ray could direct 
   films like this in his sleep. On <B>HYBRID</B>, it looks like he has. 
   Case in point: As soon as they find the facility, what do the two 
   female members (Brinke Stevens &amp; JJ North) do? Why, they head for 
   the nearest shower for a lesbian tryst! And this is just after 
   finding a half-eaten corpse. Now, I'm not asking for realism, mind 
   you. Just common sense. The whole film is full of instances like 
   that, as the screenplay (by Sean O'Bannon) is derivative of all those 
   &quot;monster loose in a building&quot; movies which flooded the home 
   video market in the 80's and 90's. When you hear, &quot;Our best bet 
   is to split up&quot;, you know it's nothing but pure laziness on the 
   writer's part.&nbsp; On the plus side are the presence of Peter 
   Spellos and Tim Abell, who never take anything they do or say very 
   seriously and there's a couple blink-and-you'll-miss-it background 
   jokes, including a &quot;Rush Limbaugh For President&quot; poster and 
   a framed picture of Ray with Brinke Stevens which triggers a 
   flashback (and some real Ray home footage). But, if you're like me, 
   you'll realize after sitting through the entire film that it didn't 
   have an original idea in it's head and you'll forget you ever watched 
   it by the next morning. It's not a bad film. It's just a blah film. 
   Also starring Ted Monte, Bobby Bragg, Nikki Fritz and a quick cameo 
   by Robery Quarry, who uses the pseudonym &quot;Robert Connell&quot; 
   here. Good move. An episode of Nite Owl Theater, which is on the DVD, 
   is much more enjoyable than the film. Fred answers a viewer's 
   question on how to get a woman to take off her top. He shows a couple

    Looks aside, he may also be the most talented of the Howard clan 
   (which includes brother Ron and father Rance). He eludes a greasy 
   charm, even when appearing in lowbrow trash such as this. Clint plays 
   a former mental patient who takes over the local ice cream route of

   ingredients to his ice cream: namely human body parts! A group of

   enemy Cory, poor schlub Jeff (Dan Smith) decides to ski off the side 
   of a mountain and lands face-first on a rock (shattering his 
   goggles), killing himself. Four years later, the girlfriend, Trina 
   (Debra DeLiso), now married to Cory (Doug Stevenson) travel to a 
   secluded ski chalet with some friends, invited there on a free 
   weekend to look at the property by a real estate agent. Meanwhile, 
   someone with broken goggles (cue POV shots) is killing his way to the 
   chalet. Could it be Jeff come back to life to get some revenge? Of 
   course not! This ridiculous Z-grade horror film contains amateur 
   acting, horrid pacing and it pulls away just as the murders are about 
   to get interesting. Why bother? There's death by bulldozer, 
   electrocution in a hottub, impalement by icicle, stabbing with a 
   butcher knife and&nbsp; a couple more. The problem is we never get to 
   see the carnage as the camera cuts away just as it is about to get to 
   the payoff. The main problem with this film is the skiing sequences. 
   This is some of the slowest skiing action you are ever about to see 
   as it looks like the steadicam operator was afraid of falling down so 
   everyone skis like they are on the bunny slope. This should have all 
   skiers rolling on the floor with laughter.&nbsp; Another negative is 
   the ability to spot the killer long before the film is over as first-time
    director Jeff Kwitny (<B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Beyond Door III">BEYOND
    THE DOOR III</A></B> - 1989) drops the ball in nearly every aspect

   of <B><A HREF="big_chill.htm">THE BIG CHILL</A></B> (1983). All he 
   ends up with is a small shiver.&nbsp; Oh well. At least it does have 
   some nudity to keep your eyes busy. It also looks as if the movie was 
   made on videotape and transferred to film, giving it a soap-opera 
   look. That's never a good thing.&nbsp; A recent film, <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Shredder">SHREDDER</A></B>

   causes a dreaded fear of water and the color red as well as causing 
   the infected to have murderous tendencies. Thank God that our hero 
   drives a red car and there are plenty of garden hoses on hand! The

   serial killer The Fisherman (the only link to the first two films) 
   and chases everyone at the local Fourth of July carnival with a

    to kill his previous victims off eBay for $39.00 and wonders if it 
   is cursed! They burn it in a campfire to cover-up their crime. Don't 
   these idiots know that metal doesn't burn?). One year passes and all 
   the friends return to Broken Ridge (some were away at college or 
   simply moved away after their friend's death) after they receive 
   invitations to a Fourth of July party. Before you can say &quot;Oops, 
   I did it again!&quot;, they begin to receive notes or text messages 
   on their phones (this is the 21st Century, after all!) that say 
   &quot;I Know What You Did&quot; and they begin getting slaughtered 
   one-by-one by someone dressed as The Fisherman. The friends begin to 
   suspect each other (there's also an insufferable amount of personal 
   drama here), but the final denouement will have you throwing heavy 
   objects at your TV screen for being duped into believing you were 
   watching a straight horror thriller, not a supernatural horror 
   thriller. I will leave it to you to discover what I mean. Why should 
   I have to suffer alone? What a lousy film! This is the type of horror 
   flick that depends on total suspension of logic or reason, as 
   everything that happens here has to be some of the world's biggest 
   coincidences or they live on some alternate Earth. To illustrate my 
   point, one of the murders committed by The Fisherman finds him 
   slicing the throat of one of the teens with his hook, but since 
   there's a circular saw next to the body and a suicide note nearby, 
   the police declare the death as self-inflicted. Nevermind that a 
   circular saw wound looks totally different than a hook wound and a 
   coroner could spot the difference in a microsecond, this film would 
   rather you don't on such things as common sense. This is also the 
   type of film that offers more false jump scares (where the music and 
   sound effects suddenly become ultra-LOUD!) and teen angst than any 
   normal person can possibly tolerate. When one of the teen girls 
   mistakens a gondola worker for The Fisherman (the crowbar he carries 
   looks exactly like The Fisherman's hook when shown in silhouette) and 
   then, a few moments later, when the killer actually tries to kill her 
   as she rides the gondola down the mountain, her dropped digital 
   camera continually snapping photos on it's own, you'll be groaning, 
   &quot;Enough already! Do you think I'm a retarded idiot?&quot; But 
   nothing is as bad as the finale of the film, which totally throws all 
   logic out the window (not to mention betraying the spirit of the 
   first two films) when it explains away the killings in one of the 
   most atrocious codas in sequel history. Shame on director Sylvain 
   White (<B><A HREF="stomp_the_yard_2007.htm">STOMP THE YARD</A></B> -

   so you don't have to. I sincerely wish that silly-ass teens would 
   stop doing stupid things so films like this will stop getting made.

   transplant their brains into young, healthy bodies. When one of the

    as a drug addict. The next day the sergeant takes Gregg back to the 
   institution to find out if his story is true. They are greeted by Dr. 
   Divine's wife, Nurse Blaine (Melody Patterson of <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Blood And Lace">BLOOD
    AND LACE</A></B> [1970]), and she shows them around, everything 
   changed from the night before. Gregg escapes from the police and 
   hides in the house of Agnes (Elmarie Wendel), whose son disappeared 
   when the institution opened across the street a year before. Agnes 
   agrees to help Gregg and goes undercover as a new patient of the 
   clinic. Agnes gets a little too nosey and is attacked and chowed-down 
   on by Gregg's brother Darrell (Greg Roche), who turns out to be one 
   of Dr. Divine's failed experiments. Gregg breaks back into the 
   institution with a gun, planning to put an end to the experiments, 
   but falls through a trap door where all the creatures are kept. He 
   blasts his way out of the lair (killing a female creature), but is 
   kept prisoner in an adjoining cell. The doctors perform their 
   experiments, throwing the leftover bodies into a giant meat grinder 
   which feeds the creatures. In a final twist, the old Dr. Divine then 
   has his brain transplanted in the much-younger Dr. Timmons (Steve 
   Jamieson). Nurse Blair, who is having an affair with Dr. Price 
   (Clarke Lindsley), blackmails Price into performing one more 
   transplant. She wants the body of June (Bekki Armstrong, Playboy's 
   September 1986 Centerfold), the last of the remaining college 
   students. Gregg, meanwhile, talks his mutant brother into setting him 
   free and he and the creatures run amok in the institution. Dr. Price, 
   with the aide of a cattle prod, disposes of two of them into the meat 
   grinder and thinks he kills Darrell with a shotgun. Gregg also gets 
   thrown into the grinder but escapes in the nick of time. Darrell 
   comes to to Gregg and June's rescue and throws Dr. Price into the 
   grinder. The new Dr. Divine and the middle-aged Nurse Blaine escape

   Government doesn't want to scare the populace. Ted walks around the

   brushes him off, saying those issues will be decided by &quot;future 
   generations&quot;. When Cass escapes from the mental institution and 
   conveniently ends up at Roger's ranch, he becomes turned-on by the 
   sight of a bikini-clad Linda lounging by the pool. He ties-up Roger 
   and kills groundskeeper Andrew (Larry Vincent) by hitting him over 
   the head with a garden hoe and then kidnaps Linda and drives away. 
   Max arrives to untie Roger and they catch up with Cass and mortally 
   wound him with a shotgun. Max (who has ulterior motives) talks Roger 
   into grafting Cass' head onto the body of Andrew's hulking retarded 
   son, Danny (John Bloom; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BrainOfBlood1971">BRAIN
    OF BLOOD</A></B> - 1971). Danny has the mind of an eight year-old 
   since he was trapped in a mine cave-in as a boy and his brain was 
   deprived of oxygen, so Roger performs the operation and creates what 
   can be best described as a two-headed conundrum: One head is docile 
   and retarded and the other head is psychotic and murderous, both 
   connected to the body of a massive giant (see how many times you can 
   spot the fake Cass head on Danny's body throughout the rest of the 
   film). When Cass becomes the dominant personality and escapes Roger's 
   laboratory (Danny: &quot;My neck hurts!&quot;&nbsp; Cass: &quot;Our 
   necks hurt, stupid!&quot;), it leads to all kinds of hijinks, best 
   discovered by the viewer. Ridiculous doesn't begin to describe how 
   ludicrous the premise is (so ludicrous and popular [it was highly 
   profitable for American International Pictures], that it spawned a 
   semi-remake in 1972 with the Ray Milland/Rosey Grier 
   horror/action/racial melodrama <B><A HREF="thing_with_two_heads_1972.htm">THE
    THING WITH TWO HEADS</A></B>, Executive Produced by John Lawrence, 
   co-written by James Gordon White and containing plenty of motorcycle 
   action), with a rape-happy two-headed monster on the loose, killing 
   necking teenagers in a local Lover's Lane and Roger covering-up the 
   escape by tying-up Linda and sedating her (he treats her no better 
   than Cass did). The epitome of outrageousness comes when Cass/Danny 
   kill a couple of bikers (one is bashed in the head with a rock and 
   the other is beaten to death with a chain) and then drowns a biker 
   chick in a lake. Casey Kasem makes for a pretty bland hero, Bruce 
   Dern is his normal wacky self and Pat Priest really has nothing 
   better to do than wear revealing clothing, take a bubble bath and 
   faint a lot. There is some blood on view, but it is rather quick and 
   subdued (this was a PG [originally GP] Rated film). Director Anthony 
   M. Lanza does try some flashy editing tricks in the beginning of the 
   film, but drops them in favor of &quot;standard&quot; storytelling 
   shortly thereafter (He must have also realized how ridiculous the 
   premise was and decided that fancy editing was not needed). This film 
   is good for a hearty laugh, but is no means a serious horror film.

   think that this film (the on-screen title is just &quot;<B>INCUBUS</B>&quot;)
    is slow-moving and has a cop-out ending, but I think there are 
   layers to this film that people are missing. The film opens with an 
   extreme close-up of an eye and as the camera pulls back, we can see 
   that the eye belongs to Dr. Sam Cordell (John Cassavetes; <B><A HREF="rosemarys_baby_1968.htm">ROSEMARY'S
    BABY</A></B> - 1968; <B><A HREF="fury_1978.htm">THE FURY</A></B> - 
   1978), who moved into the small New England town of Galen with his 
   teenage daughter Jenny (Erin Flannery) a year earlier and is still 
   considered a stranger in town, even though his is the only medical 
   practice in town (besides the hospital). Sunbathing teenage girl 
   Mandy (Mitch Martin) is brutally raped and her boyfriend murdered by 
   being hit on the forehead with a board with a nail sticking out of it 
   and being thrown in the lake by someone (or something) and Sam rushes 
   to the hospital to save Mandy's life. It seems she was raped so hard 
   that her uterus was ruptured and Sam had to perform a hysterectomy on 
   her to save his life. The unusual part (besides her being raped like 
   no one has seen before) is the total lack of semen in her. The Chief 
   of Police, Hank Walden (John Ireland; <B><A HREF="welcome_to_arrow_beach_1973.htm">WELCOME
    TO ARROW BEACH</A></B> - 1973) and Mayor Joe Prescott (Harvey <A HREF="incubus_1981c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/incubus 1981 reverse cover dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="207" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Atkin;
    <B><A HREF="#Funeral Home">FUNERAL HOME</A></B> - 1980) want a quick 
   and quiet resolution to all the crimes, but with no semen in the 
   Mandy's body and no evidence on her dead boyfriend's body (except for 
   unusually large handprints around his snapped neck), there is little 
   in the way of evidence that Sam can offer. And there's also the 
   sudden appearance of newspaper reporter/new local newspaper owner 
   Laura Kincaid (Kerrie Keane in her film debut; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Spasms">SPASMS</A></B> 
   - 1982) who is always taking photos and writing stories on the crime 
   (she tells Sam that she inherited some family money and bought the 
   newspaper because that was her dream). When the middle-aged curator 
   of the local Galen museum is brutally raped and murdered in the same 
   way as Mandy, there is one difference: There was a very large amount 
   of sperm left in her body (more than any regular man could ever 
   deposit) and Sam believes that it was left there by one rapist, 
   rather than several, which is what Hank and Joe think. When Sam 
   inspects the sperm, he discovers that it is, indeed, all from the 
   same offender, but it is unlike any semen that Sam has ever seen. It 
   is red in color like blood is part of the semen. Jenny, meanwhile, is 
   dating troubled teen Tim Galen (Duncan McIntosh), the adopted son of 
   town matriarch Agatha Galen (Helen Hughes; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Visiting Hours">VISITING
    HOURS</A></B> - 1981), who has a recurring dream about a naked woman 
   being tortured on a rack by people in hoods. It seems that every time 
   he has that nightmare, some woman is raped and killed. He hasn't had 
   the dream for several years, but they started appearing again the day 
   Mandy was brutally raped (seems her boyfriend interrupted the rape, 
   which is why there was no semen in her). As more and more women end 
   up being brutally raped and killed by the same method, Sam joins 
   forces with Laura to get down to brass tacks with the town's history. 
   It seems the same thing happened in the town 30 years earlier, but it 
   was hushed-up by the Galen family. Sam finally gets Agatha to admit 
   that Tim was taken away from his mother and she was murdered on the 
   rack as a witch, because the Galen family have always been &quot;witch
    killers&quot;. The finale finds Sam, Jenny, Laura, Tim and Agatha in 
   Sam's house because he wants his daughter to be safe and protected. 
   When Agatha tells Sam that Tim is dreaming about his mother and she 
   was an &quot;Incubus&quot; (a creature that sexually attacks women 
   with supernatural force, but can take the identity of either a man or 
   a woman), Sam finally puts two-and-two together and figures out that 
   the rapes started as soon as Laura came to town. He rushes upstairs 
   to discover that Tim is calling Laura &quot;Mother&quot; and he looks 
   on the bed and sees Jenny's lifeless body, bleeding profusely between 
   her legs. Laura hugs Sam and the camera moves in for an extreme 
   close-up of Sam's eye, the exact opposite of what we saw in the very 
   beginning of the film. Sam has lost everything he loves.&nbsp;

   go unnoticed (like Sam looking a few seconds too long at his 
   daughter's naked body as she gets out of the shower, implying that he 
   wants an incestual relationship; he divorced his wife for cheating on 
   him, and at one time in the film gives Jenny a kiss on the lips that 
   doesn't look like a father/daughter kiss) and some very weird camera 
   angles (such as the girl who is brutally raped in a bathroom stall of 
   a theater and the camera rolls in under the stall door). A lot of 
   people seem to think that John Cassavetes phones his performance in, 
   but I disagree. I think he does a beautiful job as a man who is 
   neither accepted as part of the town or a true citizen, yet does his 
   best to fit in. The reveal of the actual Incubus lasts ten seconds at 
   best, but it doesn't really need to be seen (even though its sudden 
   appearance does give you a jolt) because we see what power it has. 
   There are also some other nasty bits of gore, like a man blowing his 
   foot off with a shotgun, that will keep you on your toes (pardon the 
   pun) and if you look closely you will see an early appearance of 
   Bruce Dickinson&nbsp; as part of a band called &quot;Samson&quot; 
   playing in a theater before he became famous as the lead singer of 
   Iron Maiden. The theater also has posters for both <B><A HREF="children_shouldnt_play_with_dead_things_1972.htm">CHILDREN

    ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW</A></B> (1975) prominently on display. I 
   found the film to be rather involving with nice little touches you 
   normally don't see in a film of this nature (the nudity is mostly not 
   titilating, but rather post-mortem) or dealing with material such as 
   this (George Franklin based his screenplay on the novel by Ray 
   Russell of the same name, which you should read), so if you are

   (2011) -</B> Interesting horror film that is somewhat marred by its 
   shot-on-HD-video look (filmed using Canon 5D Mark II cameras). Most 
   of the film is shown in flashback, as we watch seemingly disturbed 
   ex-Detective Tom Caretti (Joey Fatone; ex-member of the boy band 
   NSYNC and one of this film's many Executive Producers), who is in a 
   strait-jacket in a rubber room, telling his psychiatrist what 
   happened to him and his wife Erin (Michelle Ray Smith), also a cop, 
   on a fateful day in the near past. Tom believes his wife gave birth

   into the station holding the decapitated head of a <A HREF="inkubus_2011.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/inkubus poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="189" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>recently
    murdered girl (the police already have a suspect in custody for her 
   murder and didn't believe his story when he told them that someone 
   mysteriously appeared out of thin air and cut off his girlfriend's 
   head with a large retractable blade while they were making love). 
   Inkubus instantly begins playing heads games with the skeleton crew 
   after they arrest and handcuff him, starting with Officer Tech 
   (Jonathan Silverman; <B><A HREF="weekend_at_bernies_1989.htm">WEEKEND 
   AT BERNIE'S</A></B> - 1989). While Tech begins typing his report 
   (Inkubus insists his name be spelled with an inverted &quot;k&quot;, 
   which Tech does on his computer with a simple keystroke!), Inkubus 
   effortlessly slips out of the cuffs, disappears, reappears this time 
   with his hands cuffed in front of him and seemingly makes Tech's gun 
   disappear and reappear. Tom and the rest of the small crew check out 
   Inkubus' van, where they find a whole bunch of blood and human body 
   parts. Inkubus demands his one phone call and makes the phone dial by 
   itself; the call being to retired Detective Gil Diamante (a 
   white-haired William Forsythe; <B><A HREF="rig_2010.htm">THE RIG</A></B> 
   - 2010), who nearly caught Inkubus thirteen years earlier after he 
   killed Gil's wife and his young son disappeared. He wants Gil to come 
   to the station, but first Gil needs to bring along his personal 
   psychiatrist, Dr. Emily Winstrom (Dyan Kane), who has to accompany 
   Gil everywhere since his wife was slaughtered. Meanwhile, Inkubus 
   tells the stationhouse residents that he was responsible for most of 
   the unsolved (and some that were thought to have been solved) murders 
   throughout history (including the Jack The Ripper murders), but he 
   needs to be reborn every hundred years. Since he is very near that 
   date, I guess you can already determine what is about to happen. None 
   of the cops believe his story, thinking that he is just some crazy 
   serial killer, except Gil, who shows up with Dr. Winstrom. Their 
   minds are about to be blown. Inkubus disappears and begins to slowly 
   force everyone to face their most personal demons, killing some by 
   himself with his large retractable blade and making others believe 
   they are killing Inkubus when they are, in fact, killing each other. 
   At the end of the day, only Tom and Erin are left alive, which leads 
   to the birth of the demon baby. Or was it all in Tom's mind?&nbsp; 
   The screenplay (by Carl V. Dupre; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HellraiserHWorld03">HELLRAISER:
    HELLWORLD</A></B> - 2003), effects and acting are basically above 
   par for such a low-budget effort (Even Joey Fatone, who in flashbacks 
   is bearded and is clean-shaven in the rubber room, is somewhat 
   effective), but since director/co-producer Glenn Ciano (<B><A HREF="infected_2013.htm">INFECTED</A></B> 
   - 2013, also starring Forsythe) decided to film it using HD cameras, 
   it gives the movie a washed-out cheap look which detracts from some 
   of the film's more scary moments. Some of the gory effects push the 
   film's R-rating, especially the death of Dr. Winstrom, who is cut in 
   half by Inkubus using his handy blade. When he pulls her two halves 
   apart and her guts and intestines spill out, you'll be wondering if 
   the MPAA was asleep at the wheel when they viewed this. Robert 
   Englund is very effective in his role and seems to throw himself into 
   it. The delivery of his dialogue and his overall acting here doesn't 
   make it seem like he's phoning it in, like some of his roles in other 
   recent horror films (like <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Heartstopper2006">HEARTSTOPPER</A></B>

   this is a halfway decent horror flick that should satisfy genre fans.

   someone wearing surgical gloves sets all the patients free at a 
   mental institution and murders cruel Nurse Higgins (Patti Heider) 
   with a garden claw (which may belong to a badly-burned trustee who is 
   the hospital's groundskeeper). The surgical-gloved killer steals 
   Nurse Higgins' car and escapes; the news seems to upset Frances and 
   Dwight greatly. Kelly asks one of the teacher's assistants, Peter 
   Adams (James Read), to help her solve the meaning of her recurring 
   nightmare (since he is doing his thesis on dream interpretation) and 
   cure the amnesia she has had since a young child (Frances told her 
   that she fell on her head after falling out of a tree house and spent 
   three months in a coma, but I'm willing to bet the farm that story is 
   nothing but bunk). Peter hooks Kelly up to a bunch of machines to 
   monitor her brainwaves and her EEG shows that when she is having her 
   recurring nightmare, her brainwaves are weirdly calm. Peter believes 
   the mirrors that punctuate her nightmares symbolize something very 
   important, but when Frances finds out about the experimentation, she 
   demands that Kelly stop seeing Peter (Frances also tells Dwight that 
   she's tired of keeping a &quot;horrible lie&quot; from Kelly). 
   Shortly after Kelly hears Dwight over the telephone setting up a date 
   with a secret lover, he is murdered by the surgical-gloved killer 
   with the garden claw to his throat and then is beheaded (offscreen) 
   with a machete. After attending a fraternity costume party, where

   that her real last name is Randall when Frances bursts in on the 
   session and threatens to throw Peter in jail if he has any more

   movie) or the rather easy-to-guess mystery screenplay by Charles 
   Pratt Jr. It also doesn't help that many of the murders are saved for 
   the final thirty minutes and they're nothing to write home about (a 
   few garden claw stabbings; an axe to the forehead; an arrow to the 
   chest [it's horrendously done and you'll know what I mean when you 
   see it]; a throat slitting; a knife stabbing; a speargun impalement) 
   and the blood is used sparingly. There is some nice topless and 
   full-frontal female nudity, but the sad fact is that the mystery can 
   be solved in the film's opening minutes (I solved it without even 
   trying). Not worth your time unless you are a slasher completist.

   (2010) -</B> A lot of reviewers have given this Swedish-made slasher 
   film bad press, but I think it's an effective little chiller. Sure, 
   it is derivative of such films as <B><A HREF="peeping_tom_1960.htm">PEEPING
    TOM</A></B> (1960) and <B><A HREF="psycho_1960.htm">PSYCHO</A></B> 
   (1960), but it puts a nice little spin on the story, the acting by 
   Lars Bethke (a Swedish TV veteran) is appropriately creepy, some 
   camera tricks are very inventive and the location work and extreme 
   gore make this work a lot better than it should. Bethke is David, the 
   sole proprietor of the huge Bridgeburn Hotel, which lost almost all 
   its customers due to a section of Route 56 being built that bypassed 
   the hotel. Every once in a while David gets the occasional visitor 
   who took a wrong turn and he goes out of his way to make sure they 
   are comfortable. Maybe a little too far out of his way. We se an 
   unnamed woman taking a bubble bath <A HREF="insane_2010.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/insane 2010 poster6 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="196" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>listening
    to her iPod when we see the flash and hear the sound of a Polaroid 
   camera. The woman goes to sleep and when she wakes up, she sees a 
   Polaroid photo of her taking a bath on her pillow. She is then chased 
   by someone wearing a gasmask and a knee-length black leather jacket, 
   but she is unable to escape the hotel because all the doors are 
   locked. The killer lobs a gas grenade at her and she passes out, 
   waking up chained and hanging by her arms in a room. The 
   gasmask-wearing killer pulls out a bayonet and stabs her through the 
   back of her head, the blade sticking out her mouth. The camera then 
   flips 180&#176;, turning the killer's silhouette (the killer is 
   listed as &quot;The Silhouette&quot; in the end credits) into an 
   upside-down &quot;A&quot; in the film's title, as the film's opening 
   credits begin. A young woman named Jenny (Alida Morberg; <B><A HREF="sensoria_2015.htm">SENSORIA</A></B> 
   - 2015) gets lost an her way to a music festival, when she comes upon 
   the Bridgeburn Hotel. David is glad to accommodate her every need, 
   giving her Room 13, cooking her a meal and serving her cocktails 
   (Jenny refuses to talk about who she is &quot;liaising&quot; with at 
   the festival. It is apparent that both she and David are hiding 
   secrets.) David tells her that a woman disappeared from the hotel and 
   was never heard from again and, when he takes her to her room, he 
   makes it a point to show her the creepy-looking quarry she can see 
   out her bathroom window (He tells her he likes to take walks there at 
   night). While Jenny is sleeping, we again see the flash and hear the 
   noise of the Polaroid camera and, when she wakes up, she finds the 
   photo of her sleeping on her night table. When she goes to David to 
   report someone was in her room, they both go back there and the photo 
   is missing (David mentions that the Polaroid is missing, but no one 
   ever told him it was a Polaroid. Oops!).&nbsp; That night, the 
   gasmask-wearing man returns and Jenny jumps out her bedroom window, 
   and she ends up in a strange room, which looks like an altar to all 
   the killer's victims. There is blood on the walls, candles burning 
   next to a human skull and a wall filled with Polaroid photos of his 
   victims (including the girl in the beginning of the film). The killer 
   throws a gas grenade and when Jenny wakes up, she is chained up in 
   the same room as the girl in the beginning of the film. David enters 
   the room and frees her, then &quot;calls&quot; the police, but Jenny 
   notices the phone line is cut, runs away and it looks like David is 
   an apparent psycho (David has Black &amp; White flashbacks several 
   times during the film when he was a boy at the hotel; his mother 
   massaging his shoulders and then closing his bedroom door.). Jenny is 
   eventually caught by the gasmask killer, as she hears him unsheathe 
   his bayonet and is stabbed once in the stomach and once in the back 
   (This came as a complete surprise to me because I thought Jenny was 
   going to be the heroine in this film. David also has dreams about the 
   gasmask man killing him, too, but he always wakes up before he is 
   slaughtered.). Two weeks later, Jenny's sister Sarah (Johanna Leamo) 
   pays the Bridgeburn Hotel a visit and shows David a photo of her 
   sister to see if he has seen her, since she had never shown up at the 
   music festival. He says no and gives Sarah a room for the night (She 
   wonders why one person would run such a large hotel by himself, 
   especially when there are few or no customers, and David replies that 
   he has &quot;emotional ties&quot; to the hotel and will never leave 
   it.). He makes her dinner and offers her cocktails, but she fakes 
   that she is tired and goes to her room, leaving shortly to check out 
   the hotel's computer to see if her sister was there, but David 
   catches her. David isn't mad at all and gives her a cigarette to 
   smoke with him outside, while they talk about the quarry and her 
   sister (David is an odd duck who spends all his spare time 
   hand-painting tiny pewter figurines). A bald, fat man named Frank 
   Donut (Lennart Str&ouml;m) pays David a visit and says he is looking 
   for an old couple that disappeared after visiting the hotel. Franks 
   finds the old couple's van in the back of the hotel, but he has his 
   lower jaw ripped off with a large hook wielded by the gasmask killer 
   (a very effective scene, as we see the jaw hanging on the hook). 
   Sarah goes to town to file a complaint with the police department, 
   but the doors are locked, so she starts hanging missing person 
   posters of her sister all over town (we never see anyone on the 
   streets and it actually may be a ghost town). A stranger riding a 
   four-wheel ATV happens upon Jenny's camouflaged car in the quarry's 
   snow, but the gasmask killer murders him with his bayonet. Sarah is 
   soon joined by her fiance, musician John (David Lenneman; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Ice Crawlers">ICE
    CRAWLERS</A></B> - 2002), and neither John or David are pleased to 
   see each other, especially when John first walks into the hotel and 
   notices that there is a dinner table set for two (meaning David has 
   romance on his mind for Sarah). David and John walk down to the wine 
   cellar, where John warns David to stay away from his girl and David 
   apologizes, saying he had no idea she had a fiance. Sarah discovers 
   proof that Jenny was at the hotel, so she grabs an semi-automatic 
   handgun out of her purse (it has one of those extended clips so it 
   holds more bullets!) and finds John unconscious in the wine cellar 
   with a bloody head wound. She drags John out of the wine cellar, but 
   she has to leave him downstairs to make a phone call (no cell service 
   in the hotel's cavernous basement), where she is attacked by the 
   gasmask killer, but he disappears when she turns around holding the 
   gun. She and John try to escape the hotel, but as far as they get is 
   the creepy altar room, where Sarah notices her sister's Polaroid 
   hanging on the wall and another piece of evidence that really upsets 
   her (I'll leave that for you to discover). The killer strikes again 
   and just as he is about to pull the pin on a gas grenade, John shows 
   up with the gun<A HREF="insane_2010.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/insane 2010 poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   and fills the killer full of lead. John pulls off the gasmask and it 
   turns out to be David (not really a surprise there), but Sarah 
   refuses to let John touch her and tells him to go look in the altar 
   room to find out why. It turns out David was wearing a bulletproof 
   vest and he bashes John's face in with a pipe (a really graphic 
   effect), while Sarah crawls through a boarded-up window (just barely 
   making it out) and runs, but she can't go any further because she has 
   come to the cliff of the quarry. David catches up and begins to choke 
   the life out of Sarah, while she tells him she can help him (A final 
   flashbacks shows that when David was a kid, his mother actually hired 
   him out to pedophiles. But as she is closing the door, just like in 
   all the previous flashbacks, there is now a man with David in his 
   bedroom and he is unzipping his pants.). David chokes Sarah until she 
   is dead, while we are led to believe she is going to stab him with 
   his bayonet (That is what I like about this film. When you think this 
   film is going left, it goes right.). He dumps Sarah's body in the 
   quarry's lake and, as she is sinking to the bottom, we see all of 
   David's many other victims throughout the years, including Jenny. The 
   Bridgeburn Hotel is once again open for business.&nbsp; While nothing 
   exceptional (the five screenwriters should tip you off), this is 
   still a worthwhile slasher film because everyone you think is going 
   to be a heroine or hero ends up dead and some of them are holding 
   secrets and, though not as bad as David's, are still sinful 
   nonetheless. Lars Bethke is really good in his double role of 
   David/The Silhouette, as both of their personalities couldn't be more 
   different. It is nearly impossible to get David mad at anything, but 
   his other personality more than makes up for it. The killings go way 
   past what would be acceptable for an R-Rating (the jawbone removal 
   sequence is a prime example, as it is especially nasty), The 
   actresses that play Jenny and Sarah are dubbed, but it is done so 
   well, you will never notice it (I believe they were speaking English, 
   but it came off more as what I call &quot;Swenglish&quot;, so they 
   were dubbed as to not tip-off viewers that this was a Swedish film). 
   This was the first directorial effort by Anders Jacobsson since his 
   1995 extreme gore film <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Evil Ed">EVIL ED</A></B> 
   and it was co-directed by first-timer Tomas Sandquist (who were also 
   two of the five screenwriters, the other ones being Michael Fuchs, 
   Nathan Berry and Henrik Koelman [who also wrote the storyline and 
   produced]). The snowy Swedish scenery, the large foreboding empty 
   hotel, the creepy acting by Bethke and the mysterious quarry help 
   immensely in making this film better than it has any right to be 
   (like realtors say, &quot;Location, location, location.&quot;) and 
   the final quarry lake scene is really creepy and raised a few 
   goosebumps on my arms. I actually like this little piece of gory 
   Swedish cheese and if you want to see it, you will have to watch it 
   streaming (I watched it using my Roku 3 on Amazon Prime and it was 
   free since I am a Prime member) or buy the DVD from Eagle One Media. 
   Nice kills, a plot that move quickly and takes unusual turns, a 
   take-no-prisoners killer, and an atmospheric setting makes for a 
   creepy and engaging little splatter film. Also starring Sanna Messo, 
   Tommy Hall, Anton Jacobsson (as the young David), Maria Litorell and 
   Leif Henriksson. An Eagle One Media DVD Release. <B>Not Rated</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

   (2005) -</B> I remember watching this film on SyFy and laughing my 
   ass off at the badness of it all (especially the lousy giant CGI 
   insects), but it looked to me that something was missing and, boy, 
   was I correct. I bought the film on DVD rather cheaply on a 4-movie,

    GORE PACK</A></B> for $6.00 (If there's only one film per DVD, it is 
   more worth the price, no matter what the films.). Depending on your 
   mood, this film will either have you laughing hysterically (some of 
   the humor is intentional) or falling asleep in record time. Count me 
   in the former category. My guess is that they could have went with 
   physical rather than CGI effects (even a regular-sized scorpion is 
   CGI), but we would probably end up with fewer giant insects (as it 
   stands, there aren't many in the film to begin with), but they would 
   look no better than their CGI counterparts, but at least the actors 
   would have something real to touch instead of grabbing or <A HREF="insecticidal_2005.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/insecticidal dvd8 front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="270" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>swatting
    at empty space, with the CGI creations added later on. Oh, and the 
   feeling that something was missing from the SyFy showings? Well, 
   there's tons of nudity in this film so, yes, there's about ten 
   minutes of footage missing (or replaced with clothed footage, 
   although someone wearing clothes in the shower is somewhat 
   ridiculous). If this film had physical effects rather than CGI, it 
   would probably have some small cult following. As it stands now, it

    BUILDING</A></B> (2015). Now that you have a little background, 
   here's the plot in a pupae cocoon: The females at a college sorority 
   house, especially Josi (Rhonda Dent), are sick and tired of Cani's 
   (Meghan Heffern) collection and obsession of bugs and other general 
   creatures that look like bugs. When a scorpion gets loose while Josi 
   and boyfriend Mitch (Travis Waters) are having sex (plenty of nudity) 
   and the scorpion escapes through the heating vent back to Cami's 
   room, Josi bursts into Cami's room and sprays all her insects with a 
   bug spray called &quot;Game Over&quot; and says that collecting bugs 
   is &quot;so not hot&quot; (in her best Paris Hilton imitation). Cami 
   is devastated and even her wannabe boyfriend Martin (Shawn Bachynski) 
   cannot console her. She puts each bug into a small plastic garbage 
   can, saying goodbye to each of them by name (Yes, she named every one 
   of them). Problem is, they are not dead. One of the ingredients in 
   Game Over is changing them and making them ten times bigger than they 
   normally were. We are then at a sorority party, complete with 
   lesbianism, topless girls in a hot tub and a male security guard 
   peeping on Fumi (Vicki Huang) practicing Tai Chi in skintight 
   clothes. A naked chick in the shower (I told you there was a ton of 
   nudity) is attacked by the giant scorpion and we watch it bite huge 
   chunks out of her and her flesh almost clogging the tub's drain (it 
   was a scene you only saw heavily edited on SyFy). When Cami discovers 
   that all her dead bugs are gone from her garbage can, she tells 
   Martin that she believes that insects were much bigger in prehistoric 
   times and they got smaller as the rest of the animals got smaller or 
   became extinct (kind of like reverse evolution; shit, just go along 
   with it!). Cami now believes that Game Over has reactivated the giant 
   gene. She is right, but is not prepared for what is to come. A giant 
   preying mantis kills the peeping tom security guard (You have to see 
   the praying mantis to believe how bad it is. It is the worst CGI 
   effect in the film.), while Martin has an argument with Cami about 
   her non-stop interest in insects, which earned her the nickname 
   &quot;Creepy Cami, The Bug Lover&quot; at the sorority house. He 
   thinks she should do other things, like go out and have some fun and 
   maybe have some sex with him (there's a funny line later in the film 
   dealing with that subject). Trouble is, a giant horned beetle has 
   secreted a substance on the doors and windows of the sorority house 
   that makes it impossible for anyone to leave (Super Glue should look 
   into this.). We then see a topless girl (who has a single chain 
   pierced on each nipple) wanting her boyfriend to go down on her for a 
   third time (Three times? I wanna meet this girl!), so he goes under 
   the covers and tells her she's so wet (She replies, &quot;You 
   wish!&quot;), but when she doesn't feel anything going on down there, 
   she flips the covers and discovers her boyfriend's face is covered by 
   something that looks like a giant insect egg with teeth. Don't worry, 
   there's one that falls from the ceiling onto the girl's face, so they 
   both get to die together without alerting anyone else (this is one of 
   the few examples of physical effects and is probably one the film's 
   most effective scenes, but once again, it is severely edited by 
   SyFy). As this is happening, Cami's lesbian sister Sophi (Samantha 
   McLeod) is telling her there is no such things as giant bugs. More 
   female nudity comes when Josi thinks Mitch gave her crabs (I know 
   what you are thinking, but it never happens), so she jumps in the 
   shower (She has small breasts, which is refreshing, since most of the 
   girls in this film are not silicone-enhanced) and begins spitting-up 
   maggots, as well as getting a disgusting rash all over her body. 
   Another couple are having oral sex in the hot tub outside (they use a 
   stopwatch to see who can stay underwater the longest!), when the guy 
   has to take a leak, so he goes into the woods and pees by a tree (he 
   was originally going to piss in the hot tub! Ewww.). He notices a 
   deserted pizza delivery car on the road and when he tries the 
   &quot;meat lovers&quot; pizza, he is attacked by the giant horned 
   beetle, as we watch the inside of the car's windows splatter with 
   blood. Josi is inside pouring stuff down her throat, like a giant bag 
   of sugar, a bottle of tequila (I wonder if she ate the worm?) and the 
   entire contents of the refrigerator. The rest of the girls, including 
   Sophi, now believe in the giant bugs, when they look out the window 
   and see the giant praying mantis kill the girl in the hot tub. The 
   mutant Josi then takes a few bites out of Jeni (Anna Amaroso), but 
   she escapes Josi's grip, only to get stung to death by the giant 
   scorpion. While walking down the second floor stairs in back of Cami, 
   Sophi and Fumi and Twisti<A HREF="insecticidal_2005.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/insecticidal poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="185" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   (Natalia Walker; and, yes, all the actresses' character names end 
   with the letter &quot;i&quot;), maggots fall out of Josi's snatch and 
   she chases them to the basement, where they run into a huge web and a 
   giant spider. Even Josi is forced to enter the basement, where she 
   loses an arm. Mitch, who is outside, breaks the front door open, 
   which allows all the giant insects to escape outside and enter the 
   basement through the windows. Mitch takes one look at his mutated 
   girlfriend and the giant praying mantis and drives off like a coward. 
   The giant horned beetle seemingly kills Cami, so Martin vows revenge. 
   It turns out Cami isn't dead (she injured the beetle by ripping off 
   it's horn). Cami uses herself as bait, while the others fashion some 
   weapons. They manage to electrocute the spider and the scorpion, 
   while Sophi kills the beetle with the spinning blades of a blender. 
   The praying mantis kills Sophi's lesbian lover Fumi, so Cami uses a 
   home-made spear and kills it. When morning comes, they go outside and 
   are attacked by a hideously deformed Josi, who looks like she is 
   about to give birth to millions of insects who will grow into giants. 
   Cami throws Josi into the hot tub, while Martin finishes her off by 
   throwing the electric bug zapper into the hot tub, killing Josi and 
   her millions of insect babies (Cami says, &quot;She's done.&quot; 
   after her skin is toasted by the electricity.). As the survivors are 
   walking down the street's sidewalk, Cami explains how insects will 
   never die, while a bug-infested Sluggo (Sean Whale) walks between 
   them and they don't even notice. I mean, what the fuck?&nbsp; 
   Hopefully, there will never be a sequel, even though I would like the 
   Sluggo thing explained to me. I mean, the mutation could only have 
   been done by the Praying Mantis (Although, in a gaffe, the giant 
   horned beetle is in a pizza box on the outside. Since it sealed all 
   the doors and windows, how did it get into the pizza box?). While it 
   is apparent that director Jeffrey Lando and screenwriter Jeff O'Brien 
   were aiming for a more comedic tone, the cast of unknown artists are 
   not up to the job, although there are a few funny lines and the 
   actresses have no problem doffing their tops. While the CGI is 
   typically lousy for a low-budget horror film, the few physical 
   effects are impressive (Josi's transformation; the pupae bugs 
   attacking the couple, human body part eating), which proves that 
   physical effects will always trump computer generated ones, 
   especially in low-budget horror films. The physical effects and 
   female nudity don't make this film a total failure, but it comes damn 
   close. If you decide to watch this on SyFy, it will be a total 
   failure. Also starring Anna Farrant as &quot;Belli&quot;, Chris Guy

   he co-wrote with producer Gianni Paolucci (<B><A HREF="dracula_3d_2012.htm">ARGENTO'S
    DRACULA 3-D</A></B> - 2012), so you would think it was just as 
   terrible as Mattei's first film. Well, in a way, it is, but somehow 
   Mattei manages to show a little restraint here in the gore department 
   (while there still is plenty for those looking for such things), but 
   the biggest difference from the first film is that this one is 
   basically a rip-off of <B><A HREF="predator_1987.htm">PREDATOR</A></B> 
   (1987; which Mattei also ripped-off for his <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Robowar">ROBOWAR</A></B>

    of &quot;Spot The <B>PREDATOR</B> References&quot; and be drunk 
   within 20 minutes. The daughter of an important Senator, Sara 
   Armstrong (Cindy Matic; the star of Mattei's first 2003 cannibal 
   film) is somehow captured by a tribe of cannibals in the Brazilian 
   Amazonia jungle (just how it happened is not made clear) and the 
   first commando mission sent out to rescue her was never heard from 
   again. So, our government tries again, this time with another 
   commando squad, led by Lt. Wilson (Lou Randall), who is only on his 
   second mission (!), whose other commandos include female ass-kicker 
   Vasquez (Ydalia Suarez), token black commando Sgt. Cameron (Silvio 
   Jiminez), Kruger (Santi Larrauri) and Irishman Smith (Kenny Krall). 
   Their trackers will be Romero (Claudio Morales, who was dubbed by the 
   late Ted Rusoff in that distinctive voice) and local Isias (Brando, 
   Jr., basically in the Sonny Landham role from the original film this 
   one rips off). Also along for the trip is a captive cannibal from the 
   tribe who stole Sara (Why is beyond me.). The film opens with a tribe 
   of cannibals having a human lunch when two helicopters fly overhead. 
   They land at a command post, where Lt. Wilson and his team are 
   introduced to their trackers and what exactly their mission is by 
   Oliveira (Brando, Sr.). The fact that everyone finds out that this is 
   only Lt. Wilson's second mission hardly instills any confidence in 
   him with his team or the trackers. Everyone traverses the jungle 
   carefully and they find a small encampment where C-Rations were 
   eaten, so Romero and Isias know they are on the right track 
   (Cannibals don't eat anything that comes in a can unless it's a gay 
   man's ass. Bad joke.). Romero discovers a maggot-ridden corpse, which 
   Romero determines was the last tracker sent out with the previous 
   commando team. Romero says that he was a better tracker than him or 
   Isias (while one of the commandos pukes) and that he knew this land 
   better than him. Not a good sign. Romero can also tell by their 
   captive cannibal's actions that they are well-within his tribe's 
   territory, so he makes the cannibal snort a cocaine-like substance 
   which will keep him happy and docile (something cocaine definitely 
   doesn't do!). Isias finds a wild pig and kills it (off-screen, but we 
   do see him pull out the guts and throw a piece to the cannibal) and 
   the entire commando team have a dinner of the other white meat. Now 
   is where the <B>PREDATOR</B> references and rip-offs kick-in. Isias 
   stands on a log and just stares out into the jungle, saying something 
   is in the trees but he can't see them. He makes some obscure 
   &quot;hummingbird&quot; reference (which makes absolutely no sense) 
   and the commandos move on. The captive cannibal escapes by hitting 
   Kruger in the face with a rock (Hey, wait a minute. I thought he was 
   given a happy drug!) and Smith catches him but is hit in the arm by a 
   curare-tipped blow dart. Instead of dying a painful death (there is 
   no antidote for curare), Romero shoots and kills him (Vasquez 
   promises that she will carve his name in the flesh of the cannibal 
   that killed him [she doesn't]). Lt. Wilson and his team then kill a 
   bunch of attacking cannibals by blowing the hell out of the jungle, 
   but a few of the cannibals get away. We then watch a cannibal at the 
   side of a lake killing his wife with a stone knife for being 
   unfaithful to her (this scene is surprisingly tame for Mattei, as the 
   cannibal eats her innards, but there are no close-ups of him doing 
   so). Romero says this cannibal will lead them to their target, even 
   though Vasquez wants to kill him. They follow him back to his tribe, 
   but the commandos are surprisingly treated as equals (lots of exposed 
   women's breasts here). The Chief of the tribe shows them the dead 
   rotting bodies of the commandos sent before them, caused by the tribe 
   that kidnapped Sara Armstrong. The friendly tribe have a meal with 
   the commandos, which consists of a dish made with monkey testicles. 
   The commandos head down river with some canoes supplied by the tribe 
   and find skinned human beings hanging from a tree (Sound familiar?). 
   They then find the cannibal tribe they are looking for, as they are 
   smoking a woman out of a tree and then eating her when she falls out. 
   The commandos follow the cannibal tribe to their village and begin to 
   kill every tribe member they see. They are thanked by another tribe 
   (But can they be trusted?), in which Romero strips naked (with a 
   loincloth) to gain their trust. The rest of the commandos follow 
   suit, but all they find is the rotting bodies of the rest of the last 
   commandos and learn that Sara Armstrong is the new Local Love Goddess 
   of another cannibal tribe (cannibals have never seen a blonde-haired 
   woman before), but keep her in a drugged state. If they were to take 
   Sara away out in the open, none of the commandos would make it out 
   alive, so they have to come up with a plan that will keep them all 
   alive. The commandos set the village on fire that night, but keep the 
   native deaths to a minimum by firing their weapons in the air (they 
   only kill the ones that confront them). Lt. Wilson knocks-out a 
   whacked-out, uncooperative Sara and radios-in for backup, but the 
   response they get is that it is not possible where they are (I guess 
   this Senator doesn't have as much pull as he thinks he does!). The 
   cannibal natives are mad (When Vasquez is informed that she is 
   bleeding, she replies, &quot;I got no time for bleeding&quot; in her 
   best Jesse Ventura voice) and since the commandos are on their own, 
   they have to make it to the next checkpoint in the jungle, which is 
   easier said than done. Rather than giving you a detailed description 
   of the film's final 30 minutes, I'll just give you the bullet points.

    I said in the beginning, the gore quotient is very low for a 
   cannibal film (Maybe Mattei spent most of the special makeup effects 
   budget in the first cannibal film), but there is still more gore than 
   in most American-made horror films. The acting is atrocious and Ted 
   Rusoff's voice definitely doesn't match Claudio Morales' looks. And 
   it is filled with dialogue such as, &quot;It's official. WE'RE ALL 
   FUCKED!&quot; Still, it's a helluva lot better than the first film 
   and all the footage (made in the Philippines) is original, unlike 
   Mattei's next film <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Tomb2004">THE TOMB</A></B> 
   (2004), which is filled with footage &quot;borrowed&quot; from some 
   major motion pictures. Intervision Picture Corp. released both of 
   Mattei's 2003 cannibal films on DVD in fullscreen (they released his 
   latter films in their OAR), but they are blemish-free and it really 
   doesn't hurt either film. This film is nothing special when it comes 
   to the cannibal genre, but Mattei was still the only Italian director 
   churning out sleazy films in the New Millennium, so that should count 
   for something. There is plenty of gunfire, explosions, plenty of 
   nudity (none of it titillating, if you'll pardon the pun), a 
   smattering of gore (it is used sparingly, but effectively), lots of 
   natives throwing spears and using blowguns (at least these don't look 
   like white people dressed as natives like in some of the 80's Italian 
   cannibal films) and some spectacular Filipino jungle scenery. I'm 
   sure if Mattei were still alive (he passed away in 2007), he would 
   still be churning out these sort of films. I still think that one of 
   the best films he ever made (and also the sleaziest) was 2006's <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#JailWomensHell2006">THE
    JAIL: THE WOMEN'S HELL</A></B>, so he still had more stories to 
   tell. There was no one on Earth like Mattei and his passing left a 
   huge hole in sleazy filmmaking that actually entertained.&nbsp; While 
   all others passed away or just gave up and worked in Italian 
   television, Mattei was still making films that instantly transported 
   us back to the 1980's. And for that we should thank him, no matter 
   how bad or good his films were. Also starring Brad Santana. An <A HREF="http://www.intervisionpicturecorp.com">Intervision

   Ballard&quot; written on the wall in her blood. The police suddenly 
   turn up at his apartment and Harry must flee before he is falsely (?) 
   arrested. He ends up at a fleabag hotel and calls his friend Johnny 
   (an over-the-top Tony MacIver) for help. Johnny soon ends up dead 
   (Harry finds him in an alley with his chest torn apart, his ribcage 
   exposed and his body covered in cockroaches, a recurring theme in 
   this film) and Harry has another run-in with Le Valliant and is 
   chased by a real demon (or is it?). Harry is rescued by spooky girl 
   Bennie (Katie Wolfe), who tells Harry that she is a former member of 
   the Black Lodge and that his brother Richard was also a member. Soon 
   they are both being chased by a nasty black demon and they must find 
   Le Valliant's home to reverse the curse put on both of them. We, the 
   viewers, must figure out if all this is happening or if it's just a 
   figment of Harry's imagination, especially when we discover that 
   Harry is also a closet junkie. The surprise ending ties everything up 
   nicely, but if you expect me to reveal it here, you must be high on 
   something. Let's just say that cockroach-puking is involved.&nbsp; 
   Half the fun of watching this well-plotted horror film, directed and 
   scripted by Glenn Standring (<B><A HREF="perfect_creature_2006.htm">PERFECT
    CREATURE</A></B> - 2006), is discovering the hidden clues about 
   Harry's life that are sprinkled throughout and trying to discern what 
   is fact and what is fiction. Karl Urban (who doesn't try to hide his 
   accent here as he does in his later films) is very good as the much 
   put-upon Harry, who steadfastly refuses to believe in the existence 
   of demons, even after seeing one with his own eyes. He would much 
   rather put his faith in man's inhumanity towards his fellow man, 
   believing that &quot;people get off shitting on each other&quot;. 
   There's a gag-inducing scene of Le Valliant dumping a canister full 
   of live cockroaches into Harry's mouth (No special effects here. 
   Actual live cockroaches were dumped into Urban's mouth!), which seems 
   to prove Harry's philosophy, but we still have to determine if all 
   this isn't just in Harry's troubled mind, the result of his drug 
   addiction and his grief over his brother's death. This is a fairly 
   intense film that doesn't shy away from the gore (there's a manual 
   heart removal and other bloody mayhem), but this is more of a 
   psychological puzzle that the viewer must try to piece together as 
   the film progresses. This is one of those films that requires at 
   least a second viewing to be fully appreciated, much in the same way <B><A HREF="sixth_sense_1999.htm">THE
    SIXTH SENSE</A></B> (1999) was once the denouement was revealed. The 
   only thing that hurts this film from being a totally satisfying 
   experience (besides the overacting of Tony MacIver) are the 
   badly-rendered CGI demons that show up at various times throughout 
   the film. They are really not that necessary to advance the plot and 
   therefore seem more of a distraction than a benefit. That's just a 
   minor quibble, though. This is a film that demands you use your brain 
   as well as your eyes for maximum enjoyment. Not many films can stake 
   that claim, so enjoy it for that fact alone. Also starring Peter 
   Daube, Kelson Henderson, Neill Rea, Robert Tripe, Mel Johnston and

    (Steve Hanks), becomes involved with Jan (Jo McDonnell), the 
   daughter of the owner of the nuclear power plant, who also is 
   responsible for the death of Pete's parents years earlier. Jan is 
   attacked by a pack of crabs while riding her bike and Pete comes to 
   her rescue and finds a huge crab shell in the process. Since Pete 
   works for Dr. McNeal, he brings the shell to the laboratory. Dr. 
   McNeal comes up with an anti-serum but they need to find the giant 
   crab to use it on. The crab attacks increase in intensity, as the 
   agressive crabs move further inland. It's not before Moody, Pete, 
   Jan, Rosie (Nita Talbot) and the rest of the living townspeople are 
   fighting for their lives against the marauding hordes of very hungry 
   normal size crabs and the huge crab that has the humans on his menu. 
   Can Dr. McNeal arrive in time to save the day?&nbsp; Much more 
   character-centric than most horror films of this calibre, this film 
   has more than a passing resemblance to the giant monster films of the 
   50's with a little social relevance thrown in for good measure. The 
   arrival of the Haitians into town is as first treated the same as the 
   arrival of the crabs: An intrusion. When Moody's dog is attacked and 
   killed by the crabs, everyone (but Moody) blames the Haitians (and 
   their voodoo) and they form an armed posse to hunt them down. The 
   townpeople shoot at them, until a little Haitian girl is attacked by 
   the crabs, which brings everyone together. Director Hernan Cardenas 
   (who never directed anything else) injects politics into the mix and 
   it makes for an interesting parallel, as the debate on illegal 
   immigration (in this film, it is both the Haitians and the crabs) is 
   still a hot-button issue today. Well acted by everyone, the script, 
   by Jack Cowden and Florida legend Ricou Browning (<B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Mr. No Legs">MR.
    NO LEGS</A></B> - 1981), is full of believable characters doing 
   believable things while something unbelievable is happening around 
   them. The late Robert Lansing (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Scalpel">SCALPEL</A></B> 
   - 1976; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#EmpireOfTheAnts77">EMPIRE OF 
   THE ANTS</A></B> - 1977) is really quite good here as a displaced 
   Irishman with a conscience, whom everyone in town trusts with their 
   lives. His first reaction to the giant crab is priceless. Speaking of 
   the crabs: The sight of hundreds of real crabs walking sideways on 
   land is really unnerving because, face it, that's not something you 
   see every day. The filmmakers save the appearance of the giant crab 
   for the final 15 minutes and, I have to say, it doesn't suck. This is 
   an actual full-size working model and it is impressive as it is 
   expertly photographed for maximum effect. Not particularly a bloody 
   film (it's roots, after all, come from such 50's films like Roger 
   Corman's <B><A HREF="attack_of_the_crab_monsters_1957.htm">ATTACK OF 
   THE CRAB MONSTERS</A></B> - 1957), it contains a couple of crab 
   attacks and a guy being crushed to death to in the claw of the giant 
   crab. The worst death shown here is Moody's dog. A lot of reference 
   books trash this film (originally titled <B><A HREF="giant_claws_1981.htm">GIANT

    There's the evil land developer (Malcolm McDowell) who hopes to turn 
   the island into Hope City, where the dregs of society are sent to 
   live out their pitiful lives. There's also a missing-persons 
   detective (Talisa Soto of <B><A HREF="vampirella_1996.htm">VAMPIRELLA</A></B> 
   [1996]) looking for the last victim of a case she is working on and a 
   trio of short-term cons (including Bruce Ramsay [<B><A HREF="hellraiser_bloodline_1996.htm">HELLRAISER:
    BLOODLINE</A></B> - 1996] and rapper/poet Mos Def [<B><A HREF="civil_brand_2003.htm">CIVIL
    BRAND</A></B> - 2003]) sent to the island to bury the dead. Soto and 
   Ramsay are the interesting characters here as they at first seem at 
   odds with each other because they both have something in commom 
   (which I will not divulge here) but then become to admire each other 
   when the going gets tough. And get tough it does. It seems that there 
   is a strain of flies on this island that one single bite causes the 
   person to deform and burst out with maggots in a matter of minutes. 
   The maggots then turn into flies. Where they came from or how they 
   mutated is never explained. They are just here and have to be 
   avoided. After most of the people on the island are killed by the 
   flies, it's just McDowall, Soto and Ramsay that remain. The neat 
   thing about this movie is that dastardly McDowall never loses his 
   cool, even when the flies trap them in a building with no discernable 
   way out. He still barks orders like he owns all of humanity and shows 
   little respect for his fellow man. Even when he is eventually bitten, 
   he shows a comical dignity in his death, picking up his favorite 
   watch off the ground as his face and body bloat out and explode 
   maggots all over the place. No one plays bastards better than Malcolm 
   McDowall. The ending finds Soto and Ramsay escaping the island and 
   getting back to NYC, where she gets him off on the trumped-up charges 
   he was incarcerated for. What happened to the swarm of killer flies 
   is never explained. Director/co-writer Tim Southam (who has made many 
   shorts and other non-genre movies in his native Canada) infuses the 
   film with little touches of humanity and humor (such as when Mos Def 
   asks another nose-pierced con what happens when he gets a booger in 
   his nose) to make this film more than just a horror film. There's 
   also some grisly deaths and insect POV shots that, at first, had me 
   confused until I realized that I was watching a scene through a fly's 
   eye. Daniel Pilon (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Scanners 3">SCANNERS 
   III: THE TAKEOVER</A></B> - 1991) has a cameo as the Mayor of New 
   York City. This film has more meat on it's bones than most horror 
   films because it's not just about the horror: It's also about the 
   people. There's nothing wrong with that. A Key Video DVD Release that 
   can be picked up for less than 10 bucks at any local Best Buy.</FONT></FONT></P>

   This is late director Bruno Mattei's (using his frequent pseudonym 
   &quot;Vincent Dawn&quot;) penultimate film, a tale of zombies and 
   vampires on an uncharted island. The frustrated treasure-hunting crew 
   of the salvage ship The Dark Star (a tribute to John Carpenter?) 
   encounter a strange fog bank one stormy night and wake up the 
   following morning next to an island that is not on any map, an island 
   where, centuries before, a zombie uprising and an attack by a vampire 
   pirate crew killed an entire village of Spanish missionaries and a 
   battalion of Conquistadors. With The Dark Star in need of repair, the 
   crew takes a trip to the island to see if they can find any treasure 
   to plunder. They do indeed find treasure, but more importantly, they 
   discover that the island is crawling with zombies. When The Dark Star 
   explodes (thanks to a gas leak during a zombie invasion) and the 
   lifeboat ends up missing, the crew, which includes Captain Kirk 
   (Ronald Russo), Sharon (Yvette Yzon), Snoopy (Filipino regular Jim 
   Gaines; <B><A HREF="action.htm#PhantomSoldiers">PHANTOM SOLDIERS</A></B> 
   - 1987), Fred (Alvin Anson), Mark (Gary<A HREF="island_of_the_living_dead_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/island of the living dead-mattei poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="184" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   &quot;King&quot; Roberts) and Victoria (Ydalia Suarez), must find a 
   place to hide out and defend themselves from the living dead hordes. 
   They find an old church and settle in, while Captain Kirk (a favorite 
   joke name that Mattei used in many films) tells them that this must 
   be the final resting place of an old Spanish ghost galleon called the 
   Natividad, said to be carrying a king's fortune in gold. The next 
   morning, the group (stupidly) split-up into three teams of two and 
   explore the catacombs of the church. Sharon and Fred run into an 
   undead monk and Fred blows it's head off with a shotgun. Victoria and 
   Mark find a cask of old wine and proceed to get drunk, not realizing 
   the the wine is crawling with maggots. The Captain and Snoopy make 
   discoveries of their own, including a creepy old zombie woman who 
   plays the lute. When the crew discovers the hidden treasure of gold, 
   they won't get a chance to enjoy it, because they are attacked by 
   hordes of flesh-hungry zombies. Fred (stupidly) sacrifices his life 
   to the zombies so the others can escape. Sharon discovers a book that 
   says whoever discovers the treasure will be killed by the pirate crew 
   of the ghost galleon, who will rise from the ocean floor (apparently 
   as vampires!) to exact revenge. Oh, great. Now the crew has to 
   protect themselves from vampire pirates as well as zombies. To make a 
   long story short, the crew dies one-by-one in various bloody ways 
   (usually eaten in one manner or another) until only Sharon is left. 
   She manages to make it off the island and is rescued by a helicopter, 
   her story to be continued in Mattei's final film, <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#ZombiesTheBeginning">ZOMBIES:
    THE BEGINNING</A></B> (2007), although with slight alterations (The 
   surprise final reveal here shows that Sharon is now a vampire zombie, 
   but the sequel drops that plot point, making it a nightmare sequence 
   in a hospital room instead).&nbsp; While not a very good film in many 
   departments (the dubbing and dialogue are terrible and the acting is 
   way too bland), director Bruno Mattei (<B><A HREF="#HellLivingDead1980">NIGHT
    OF THE ZOMBIES</A></B> - 1980; <B><A HREF="action.htm#CopGame1988">COP

   - 1989), who co-wrote the screenplay with Antonio Tentori and 
   Producer Gianni Paolucci, does his normal routine of copying scenes 
   verbatim from other well-known horror films and claims them as his 
   own. Here, he lifts scenes directly from <B><A HREF="night_of_the_living_dead_1968.htm">NIGHT
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> (1968; The &quot;They're coming to get 
   you Barbara!&quot; graveyard scene), Lucio Fulci's <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Zombie">ZOMBIE</A></B> 
   (1979; The pointy wood shard in the eyeball scene) and John 
   Carpenter's <B><A HREF="fog_1980.htm">THE FOG</A></B> (1979; the 
   ghostly, fog-shrouded pirate crew) and tries to tie it all together, 
   but doesn't accomplish the task. The film seems too disjointed to 
   make much sense and it's one of those films where the characters make 
   the stupidest decisions possible (especially Fred sacrificing his 
   life and offering his arm for the zombies to chew on!) just to 
   justify the gory deaths that follow. Still, the makeup and gore 
   effects aren't horrible and the Philippines location photography is 
   very colorful, making this a perfect film for Mattei fans: High on 
   gore, low on believable characters and originality. You'll know 
   within the first five minutes of watching this whether it is a film 
   for you. The film concludes with a dedication to actor Mike Monty (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#NinjaWarriors">NINJA
