    THE COLORS OF THE DARK</A><A NAME="AllColorsDark1972"></A> (1972) -</B> 
   Right off the bat, I could see that this Italy/Spain co-production 
   was going to be a very interesting giallo flick. It stars a cast of 
   giallo pros, it's directed by the man who made my favorite giallo 
   film of all time (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Torso1973">TORSO</A></B> - 
   1973; the majority of his films have never let me down) and it begins 
   with one of the most surreal dream sequences I have seen in quite a while.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The dream consists of a dentally challenged ugly woman (Vera Drudi; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Let Sleeping Corpse">LET
    SLEEPING CORPSES LIE</A></B> - 1974) in a Baby Jane wig showing off 
   her blackened teeth, while a pregnant woman on a hospital gurney is 
   in the position to drop her baby, holding her stomach. We also see a 
   clock with no hands lying on the floor, as well as a close-up of a 
   man's haunting and unusual deep-blue eyes. We then see Jane (the 
   beautiful <A HREF="edwige_fenech_most_beautiful_italian_actress.htm">Edwige
    Fenech</A>; <B><A HREF="#StripNudeKiller">STRIP NUDE FOR YOUR KILLER</A></B> 
   - 1975) screaming,<A HREF="all_the_colors_of_the_dark_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/all the colors of the dark dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   while the ugly woman is taunting her. The dream ends with Jane dead, 
   her stomach cut open and bloody, the ugly woman turning into a 
   mannequin, as we then see a car's POV as it slams into a tree. Jane 
   then wakes up and takes a shower in her bedclothes (Giving us a great 
   wet t-shirt shot of Fenech. Damn, she is beautiful!). Her 
   fianc&eacute;, Richard (George Hilton; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#KillerMustKillAgain">THE
    KILLER MUST KILL AGAIN</A></B> - 1973), a London pharmaceutical 
   salesman, comes home, finding Jane in the shower (he knows what is 
   wrong with her or, he thinks he does) and puts her back in bed, 
   making her take her pills (which turns the glass of water a bright 
   blue color), telling her that they are &quot;vitamins&quot;, but they 
   make her sick. We then see Richard making love to Jane (did I mention 
   how beautiful Fenech is?), but she starts screaming. She tells 
   Richard that her sister Barbara (Nieves Navarro, as &quot;Susan 
   Scott&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Tormentor1972">TORMENTOR</A></B> 
   - 1972) said she should see her psychiatrist boss, Dr. Burton (George 
   Rigaud; <B><A HREF="#Eyeball1975">EYEBALL</A></B> - 1975), because he 
   could probably make the nightmares stop. Richard says no, she should 
   keep psychiatry away from her &quot;problem&quot;. We then find out 
   what is causing the nightmares. Jane recently lost her unborn baby in 
   a car accident and Richard thinks she doesn't need her head shrunk, 
   she just needs time to recover. Richard reminds her not to forget, it 
   was his baby, too. Richard leaves for work, walking outside and 
   seeing two young lovers hugging each other, the look on Richard's 
   face telling us he wishes Jane wouldn't be so afraid of a little 
   affection like that. Who is the woman in the apartment across from 
   Jane's, who looks out her window at Richard with lust in her eyes? 
   Jane, who is looking out her window, sees the woman, who then closes 
   her curtains. That woman is Mary Weil (Marina Malfatti; <B><A HREF="#SevenBloodOrchids72">SEVEN
    BLOOD-STAINED ORCHIDS</A></B> - 1972) and very soon she will be 
   involved in Jane's life, with deadly results.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Jane tells Barbara that she knows Richard loves her, but he doesn't 
   understand her, Barbara saying she knows that and has set up an 
   appointment with her with Dr. Burton, fully aware that it is against 
   Richard's wishes. While sitting in Dr. Burton's waiting room, Jane 
   sees the man with the blue eyes (Ivan Rassimov; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Spasmo">SPASMO</A></B> 
   - 1974) from her nightmares sitting on the other side of the room, 
   staring at her. When talking to Dr. Burton, Jane explains that the 
   pregnant woman in her nightmare is her mother, describing to him how 
   she saw her mother murdered by a man with piercing blue eyes when she 
   was five years old. When the doctor asks Jane if she has told her 
   husband the details of her nightmare, she tells him no, she and 
   Richard are not married and she's afraid he will not understand. She 
   also tells the doctor that ever since the car accident, she is not 
   &quot;comfortable&quot; with sex, but she does not believe the 
   accident is the cause, she believes the image of the blue-eyed man is 
   the cause, but she can't tell Richard because she's afraid that he 
   will leave her (&quot;I already make his life so difficult.&quot;). 
   She tells the doctor about the blue-eyed man in the waiting room and 
   he says she must be mistaken, he never has his patients wait 
   together. He takes her to the waiting room and, sure enough, no one 
   is there. Jane asks Barbara if she saw a man in the waiting room and 
   she says yes, he wasn't a patient, but he wanted to talk to the 
   doctor. He suddenly got up and left without saying a word. The doctor 
   apologizes to Jane, also telling her that at their appointment they 
   will talk about why she is so frightened of the blue-eyed man and to 
   stop taking the &quot;vitamins&quot; Richard is giving her, telling 
   Jane, &quot;Your worst enemy is loneliness.&quot; Jane then takes the 
   subway home and at the next stop, everyone else get off, leaving Jane 
   alone with a solitary figure at the other end of the subway car. It's 
   the blue-eyed man and he approaches Jane (the subway car goes from 
   darkness to light and every time it goes to light, the man is closer 
   to her), but she is able to get out of the car at the next stop. The 
   man meets her on the street, causing Jane to run home screaming, 
   &quot;Why are you following me?!?&quot; She meets Mary at her front 
   door and she invites Jane over for some tea. Over tea, Mary invites 
   Jane to have lunch at her place tomorrow, telling Jane that she knows 
   she is alone all day and could use some company. Jane agrees and goes 
   home, where she gets a phone call from a lawyer named Francis Clay 
   (Luciano Pigozzi, as &quot;Alan Collins&quot;; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Libido1965">LIBIDO</A></B> 
   - 1965), who tells her to come to his office tomorrow at 3:30 PM 
   because he has something important to tell her. When Jane asks him 
   what it is about, he hangs up the phone.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Jane looks out her window that night, she sees the blue-eyed 
   man walking down the street, so she goes outside to investigate, 
   accidentally locking herself out of her apartment building. Jane 
   begins to get very nervous and begins knocking on Mary's door, but no 
   one answers. Just when Jane is about to lose it, Richard shows up and 
   unlocks the door. She tells him about her day and, the next morning, 
   Richard is at Barbara's apartment, chewing her out for taking Jane to 
   a psychiatrist (and ogling her while she is getting changed!). 
   Barbara tells him, like it or not, Jane will continue to see Dr. 
   Burton, saying &quot;Jane is a slave to her childhood, but I bet you 
   blame that on me!&quot; What did she mean by that and is there 
   something romantic going on between Richard and Barbara? We then 
   discover that Richard was driving the car that hit the tree, killing 
   Jane's baby.&nbsp; Barbara asks Richard if he wonders if that's the 
   reason Jane won't marry him and he storms out of her apartment. Yes, 
   this film is full of little surprises, but the best is yet to come.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Mary and Jane are walking in the park, where Jane begins talking in 
   strange ways, first saying, &quot;Listen to the birds. They are 
   complaining that we are here.&quot; Jane asks Mary if she would 
   believe that a killer from her childhood is following her. Mary turns 
   to her and says, &quot;I believe in a lot more.&quot; What does she 
   mean by that?&nbsp; Mary tells her that she, too, had major problems 
   when she was a child, but she found a way to destroy those memories. 
   She then asks Jane if she knows what a &quot;Black Mass&quot; is (Uh, 
   oh!) and Jane says that Mary is scaring her. Mary says don't be 
   frightened, you, too, can put all your bad memories behind you. Jane 
   then says, &quot;But...what do you want from me?&quot; Mary tells her 
   to stop going to a psychiatrist, she has a &quot;friend&quot; who can 
   cure her of her troubles. Jane asks who is this person, Mary 
   replying, &quot;My friends don't like questions. They just want 
   trust. They're waiting for you.&quot;&nbsp; Jane wants to meet her 
   friends, so Mary tells her to meet her at her apartment at exactly a 
   5:30 this afternoon. If she is not on time, she will leave without 
   her. Jane then drives to go see lawyer Francis Clay and begins to 
   walk up several flights of stairs to get to his office. Suddenly, an 
   animal skull comes rolling down the stairs, followed by the blue-eyed 
   man, who tries to kill Jane with a hand axe. Jane runs down the 
   stairs, out the building and into her car, where, after a few false 
   starts (her car won't turn over), she drives to go meet Mary. She 
   tells Mary that the blue-eyed man tried to kill her, so Mary drives 
   her to a mansion, where they witness (and participate in) a Black 
   Mass. Jane sees the cult's leader, J.P. McBrian (Julian Ugarte; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#FangsLivingDead1969">FANGS
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> - 1969), slit the throat of a live fox 
   (!) and drain its blood in a ceremonial goblet, which the cult 
   members and Jane drink, culminating in an orgy, where Jane is passed 
   around, naked, to the cult members and, finally, to their leader (who 
   sports enormous black metal fingernails on all his fingers). That 
   night, Jane is able to make love to Richard without being repulsed, 
   for the first time since she lost the baby. So, is witchcraft the 
   answer to Jane's problems? Jane thinks so, but if we know one thing 
   about the supernatural, it is this: No matter how good the results, 
   you always have to pay the Devil. What does this cult want from Jane? 
   Could it be her soul or something more dastardly?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Richard is so happy with Jane's lovemaking that he takes a rare day 
   off of work so he and Jane can have lunch at a restaurant. Richard 
   leaves the table to make a phone call and Jane sees Mr. Blue Eyes 
   skulking outside. Jane runs out of the restaurant's back door, hails 
   a cab and goes home, not thinking about Richard. Jane finds a book on 
   magic and the supernatural among Richard's things and when Richard 
   comes home, demanding an explanation on why she left him in the 
   restaurant, she demands to know why Richard has this book.&nbsp; He 
   tells her he bought it at a used bookstore, but doesn't tell her why 
   he bought it (looking guilty about something). The next time we see 
   Jane, she is back at the mansion in the middle of another Black Mass, 
   where she stabs and kills Mary with a ceremonial dagger (Mary 
   welcomes it). Jane believes she is finally free, but when she is in 
   the park, the blue-eyed man, whose name is Mark Cogan, grabs Jane by 
   the arm and says, &quot;Now you're one of us. You can't turn your 
   back on us any more. Come, he is waiting for us!&quot;, leading her 
   into the mansion and the blood-filled Black Mass room. J.P. McBrian 
   appears and says to Jane, &quot;With us you won't be alone any more! 
   You belong to us forever, Jane!&quot; She asks where Mary is, 
   demanding to see her <A HREF="theyre_coming_to_get_you_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/they're coming to get you poster12 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="309" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>and
    McBrian says, &quot;As you wish. Mary wanted to be free. Anyone who 
   wants to go free has to bring a new adept (replacement).&quot; Guess 
   who that is? What has Jane gotten herself in to? If you want to find 
   out, you'll have to watch the film, because most of the grisly 
   thrills and surprises come after what I have just described to you. I 
   will tell you this: The harder Jane tries to get away from the cult, 
   the more painful it becomes for her (physically and emotionally), 
   until she cannot trust those closest to her.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Director Sergio Martino hasn't let me down yet when it comes to the 
   giallo films he has directed (<B><A HREF="#StrangeViceWardh71">THE 
   STRANGE VICE OF MRS. WARDH</A></B> - 1971; <B><A HREF="#YourViceLockedRoom">YOUR
    VICE IS A LOCKED ROOM...</A></B> - 1972; the aforementioned <B><A HREF="torso_1973.htm">TORSO</A></B> 
   - 1973; and even <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Scorpion2Tails1982">THE
    SCORPION WITH TWO TAILS</A></B> - 1982 to some extant) and he 
   certainly doesn't disappoint with this film (the only Martino giallo 
   film I haven't seen is <B><A HREF="#CaseScorpionsTail71">THE CASE OF 
   THE SCORPION'S TAIL</A></B> - 1971, but that will be rectified soon). 
   Filmed much in the same way as his other giallo flicks 
   (cinematography by Miguel Fernandez Mila [<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LoreleysGrasp1973">THE
    LORELEY'S GRASP</A></B> - 1973; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#PeopleOwnDark1975">THE
    PEOPLE WHO OWN THE DARK</A></B> - 1975] and Giancarlo Ferrando [who 
   shot many of Martino's other genre films, including <B><A HREF="action.htm#ViolentProfession73">THE
    VIOLENT PROFESSIONALS</A></B> - 1973; <B><A HREF="#SuspicDeathMinor75">THE
    SUSPICIOUS DEATH OF A MINOR</A></B> - 1975; and <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#MountainCannibal78">MOUNTAIN
    OF THE CANNIBAL GOD</A></B> - 1978]) and loaded with his patented 
   flourishes, such as using a fisheye lens to film the Black Mass and 
   orgy scenes, giving them an otherworldly feel, as well as implying 
   that psychiatry is a cure for witchcraft (!), this film is never 
   boring. Weird? Yes, but boring? Never. Besides those flourishes, 
   there is plentiful nudity by Edwige Fenech, who I consider to be one 
   of the most beautiful and talented women in Italian film history (and 
   not just genre films). Most of the other actresses also have nude 
   scenes, making this film easy on the eyes. If I do have one complaint 
   (and it's minor), it's that this film is missing the graphic violence 
   we expect in a giallo film, but when it does happen (the fox being 
   killed, seeing Mary's dead body for the first time, the bloody 
   finale), it is shocking. When it comes to mixing giallo and 
   supernatural horror elements together, this film would be 
   hard-pressed to be beaten, mainly because Martino is at the helm. He 
   knows what makes these films work and he doesn't disappoint here. The 
   screenplay for this film was written by his longstanding 
   collaborator, Ernesto Gastaldi, who also knows what makes a giallo 
   film work, as he has written some of the best of them, including <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#AForAssassin1966">A...FOR
    ASSASSIN</A></B> (1966); <B><A HREF="sweet_body_of_deborah_1968.htm">THE
    SWEET BODY OF DEBORAH</A></B> (1968); <B><A HREF="#DeathWalksMidnite72">DEATH
    WALKS AT MIDNIGHT</A></B> (1972) and many, many more. So sit back, 
   try to relax (it won't be easy here) and enjoy a film from one of the 
   best giallo directors. And, oh, that ending! It certainly surprised 
   me and I hazard to guess it will you, too.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    NIGHTMARE</A><A NAME="AmerNightmare81"></A> (1981) -</B> I've always 
   considered this film a sleazier low-budget Canadian version of director/writer
    Paul Schrader's <B><A HREF="hardcore_1979.htm">HARDCORE</A></B> 
   (1979) and once you watch it, I think you will see the similarities, 
   too. Just like Schrader's film, this one is about a man completely 
   out of his element, who makes some surprising choices along the way 
   in search of someone he loves. The film opens with stripper/hooker 
   Isabelle (Alexandra Paul; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Spectre1996">SPECTRE</A></B> 
   - 1996) in a cheap motel room, naked in bed and smoking a joint. She 
   is talking to a man in the bathroom (we never see his face or hear 
   his voice), who is washing his hands and putting on a pair of 
   surgical latex gloves. Isabelle is apologizing about some videotapes 
   being made and swears she didn't know anything about it. The man 
   comes out of the bathroom dressed in<A HREF="american_nightmare_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/american nightmare 1981 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   nothing but a towel, mounts Isabelle and then graphically slits her 
   throat with a straight-razor. We are then introduced to Isabelle's 
   brother Eric (Lawrence S. Day), a Classically-trained pianist and 
   best-selling recording artist (he has the gold records hanging on his 
   walls to prove it!), as he knocks on Isabelle's apartment door (he 
   hasn't talked to Isabelle in quite a while, but she sent him a letter 
   saying that she was in big trouble and needs his help), but gets no 
   answer. Her cross-dressing across-the-hall neighbor Dolly (Larry 
   Aubrey; <B><A HREF="vindicator_1986.htm">THE VINDICATOR</A></B> - 
   1986) informs Eric that Isabelle is a stripper that uses the name 
   &quot;Tanya&quot; (&quot;They always change their names when they do 
   it.&quot;) and that he hasn't seen her in a couple of days. This 
   leads Eric on an odyssey of the seedier side of life, where the 
   streets are full of strip clubs, porno stores, porno theaters and 
   prostitutes. He is truly a stranger in a strange land. When Isabelle, 
   a.k.a. &quot;Tanya&quot;, doesn't show up for her normal stripping 
   gig, club manager Wally (Peter Lavender) asks the off-duty Tina 
   (Lenore Zann; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HappyBirthdayToMe">HAPPY 
   BIRTHDAY TO ME</A></B> - 1980) to fill in for her (Wally says about 
   &quot;Tanya&quot;: &quot;Shit, she's probably so spaced out on 
   'ludes, she can't dial a phone!&quot;). Tina agrees because Tanya is 
   a friend and doesn't want her to be fired, so she goes on stage (she 
   wears a Devil costume and dances provocatively with a pitchfork), 
   much to the dismay of her boyfriend Mark (Page Fletcher; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Humongous">HUMONGOUS</A></B> 
   - 1981), who would rather Tina come home with him. Eric confronts his 
   estranged father, Hamilton Blake (Tom Harvey), the owner of the huge 
   corporation Blake Industries (who are holding some kind of telethon 
   called &quot;UNI Saves&quot; in the very near future), with the note 
   Isabelle sent him and asks for help in finding her, but Hamilton says 
   it was her and Eric's choice to leave the family and he wants nothing 
   more to do with her. When Eric leaves, Hamilton pulls a photo of 
   Isabelle out of his desk and fondles it, so we know there is more to 
   the story. Eric starts interviewing &quot;Tanya's&quot; friends: 
   strippers Louise (Lora Staley; <B><A HREF="thief_1981.htm">THIEF</A></B> 
   - 1981) and Andrea (Claudia Udy; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Nightforce">NIGHTFORCE</A></B> 
   - 1986), but comes away with little information. He then goes to the 
   police, where he talks to Sgt. Skylar (Michael Ironside; <B><A HREF="scanners_1981.htm">SCANNERS</A></B> 
   - 1980; here billed as &quot;Mike Ironside&quot;), who tells Eric 
   that he doesn't have much faith in what strippers say, but he will 
   look into it. Meanwhile, the faceless killer murders Andrea by 
   slitting her wrists and drowning her in the bathtub, making it look 
   like a suicide. As the killer is exiting the building, he bumps into 
   the cross-dressing Dolly and he gets a good look at the killer's 
   face. Louise doesn't believe that Andrea committed suicide and Eric 
   asks her for help at Andrea's funeral. At first she turns him down 
   (&quot;You're asking me for help at a funeral?!?&quot;), but when the 
   killer tries to murder her and fails, she forms an uneasy alliance 
   with Eric to discover the truth. Hamilton's right-hand man, Tony Shaw 
   (Neil Dainard), asks Eric to play the piano at his father's telethon, 
   but Eric tells Tony to tell his father to go to hell (clue alert!). 
   Eric thinks he can trace Isabelle/Tanya's whereabouts by finding out 
   what telephone calls she received from her answering service (the 
   same service Louise uses). Eric and Louise get a list of numbers 
   after bribing the lady at the answering service and notice there were 
   several calls made by someone known as &quot;The Fixer&quot; at a 
   cheap hotel. Dolly decides he is better off leaving town for good, 
   but he chooses too late, as the killer grabs him in an alley and 
   stabs him in the heart. Eric and Louise are nearly mugged, until Eric 
   intervenes and turns the table on the mugger (I guess playing the 
   piano gives you strong hands!). After Louise witnesses Eric saving 
   her life, they become lovers and have sex at Eric's palatial 
   apartment. While Louise is sleeping, Eric sneaks out and heads to the 
   cheap hotel and strong-arms the hotel manager (Paul Bradley). The 
   manager tells him that The Fixer videotapes all the girls having sex 
   with their tricks, but only The Fixer has the videotapes and he has 
   no idea where he is. Eric and Louise look through the slimier streets 
   of town (where we see a theater marquee advertising the porn film <B><A HREF="second_coming_of_eva_1974.htm">THE
    SECOND COMING OF EVA</A></B> - 1974) looking for The Fixer (this is 
   after Louise goes through an embarrassing &quot;audition&quot; for a 
   role in the UNI Saves telethon, but she has a callback) and when 
   Louise goes home because she is tired, Eric finds The Fixer (Mike 
   Copeman) in a porno theater and uses The Fixer's own gun to force him 
   to tell Eric where the videotapes are (at a bus station locker). 
   While Mark is being sweated by Sgt. Skylar as the possible killer, 
   the real one shows up after hours at the strip club and slices Tina's 
   throat with a knife. When Eric watches the videotapes, he sees a 
   familiar face on one of the tapes and it ain't his sister's (well, 
   half of it is)! It's Hamilton fucking his own daughter and when Eric 
   confronts him with the evidence (Hamilton says he been screwing his 
   own daughter since their mother died!) and says he is going to turn 
   it over to the Press and the police, Hamilton commits suicide by 
   shooting himself in the head. As you can guess by now, Hamilton is 
   not the killer; it was Tony (Eric also discovers it <A HREF="american_nightmare_1982b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/american nightmare reverse cover dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="193" HEIGHT="271" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>is
    him when he finds Dolly's body and he is holding a key piece of 
   evidence in his dead, clenched hand), who was trying to keep his boss 
   squeaky clean by burying the evidence and the people involved. Eric 
   must race to the UNI Saves auditions, where Louise is 
   &quot;rehearsing&quot; for Tony. Can Eric save Louise in time before 
   Tony takes her life?&nbsp; This is a cheap, tawdry look at a slice of 
   life that most of us never see and, therefore, is must viewing for 
   people interested in the subject matter. It is full of tits and ass 
   (but no bush) and has enough bloody violence to satisfy early-80's 
   gorehounds, too. Director Don McBrearty is better known for directing 
   episodes of Canadian TV series and TV movies (such as <B><A HREF="haunting_of_lisa_1996.htm">THE
    HAUNTING OF LISA</A></B> - 1996), which he is still doing at the 
   time this review was written. Screenwriter John Sheppard (<B><A HREF="bullies_1986.htm">BULLIES</A></B>

   movie, except it is much more down and dirty than the George C. 
   Scott-starrer. I actually prefer <B><A HREF="american_nightmare_1982b.htm">AMERICAN
    NIGHTMARE</A></B> over Schrader's film because it is able to go 
   places and show things not acceptable in a big-budget film. Producer 
   Ray Sager got his start as an actor in a few films by goremaster H.G. 
   Lewis (eventually appearing in the title role in Lewis' <B><A HREF="wizard_of_gore_1970.htm">WIZARD
    OF GORE</A></B> - 1970), before becoming a respected Producer of

   well as many Canadian TV movies and television series up to this day. 
   This film was his first as a Producer. One of the Executive Producers 
   was Paul Lynch, who also has a healthy career as a director, making 
   the aforementioned <B>PROM NIGHT</B>, <B>HUMONGOUS</B> and <B>BULLIES</B>,

   that the DVD offered by Scorpion Releasing is also a fullscreen print

   disclaimer before the film starts that says this was the only element 
   of the film that could be found and is not up to Scorpion's usually 
   great quality, but it is still better than the VHS print because you 
   can see what is going on in some of the darker scenes. It is full of

   You would think that a film that begins with a quote by Charles

    then see high school punker Josh (Graham Emmons) get out of bed at 
   6:56 AM and then look at himself in the cracked bathroom mirror (a 
   not so subtle way of saying this boy has some problems; we also hear 
   his thoughts telling him to stay in bed and not go to school). He 
   then has some breakfast while his mother and father totally ignore 
   him and gets picked up by friends (and fellow punkers) Ray (Joseph 
   Abplanalp, in a terrific performance) and Sammy (Taylor Hulett) in 
   Roy's van and head off to another day of school punishment. Brandon 
   (Nathan Green) and his usual bunch of superior-thinking jocks make 
   comments like &quot;Cheerleader pussy rocks&quot; and Brandon's 
   cheerleader girlfriend Tasha (Louise MacDonald) hears him and remarks 
   that he will be lucky if he gets any. Brandon and the jocks do their 
   daily bullying routine of the three punkers, telling them<A HREF="american_terror_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/american terror 2012 dvd front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   they need Brandon's permission to cross the football field and 
   Brandon hauls off and punches and spits on Ray for talking back to 
   him. We then see the three punkers in a basement watching a revenge 
   movie on TV that night and when they get out of school the next day, 
   someone has spray-painted &quot;FAGS&quot; across the passenger side 
   of Ray's van. The cheerleaders laugh hysterically and take pictures 
   of the van with their camera phones. The punkers are tired of being 
   bullied because they dress and act differently from everyone else 
   (this goes on daily in reality in almost every school in America), so 
   Ray blurts out &quot;We need guns!&quot; (He wants to pull off a 
   Columbine on the jocks and cheerleaders). The best they can do is 
   come up with a 50 year-old handgun from Sammy's stepfather, but Ray 
   sees a redneck (an unrecognizable Brian Thompson [<B><A HREF="cobra_1986.htm">COBRA</A></B> 
   - 1986; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Nightwish1988">NIGHTWISH</A></B> 
   - 1988]) hauling a refrigerator away from Tasha's house (she needed 
   to get rid of it and offered it free on an internet site saying 
   &quot;first come, first served&quot;) and makes Josh write down the 
   company's phone number down. Ray says to the other two that the best 
   place to get guns is from a redneck, so they do a reverse phone 
   search of the number and find that the redneck's location (the end 
   credits list Thompson's character name as &quot;The Junker&quot;, but 
   I'll stick with &quot;redneck&quot; since that is what the punkers 
   call him) is 40 miles away from Denver (this film was lensed in 
   Denver, Colorado). Ray and Josh plan to drive the 40 miles to the 
   redneck's junkyard, while Sammy goes to the hardware store to get the 
   components he needs to make pipe bombs. Ray tells Sammy if they don't 
   return on time, he is to go through with the act of revenge, but make 
   sure it is during Homecoming Night, when the jocks and their 
   cheerleader girlfriends will be there. Ray and Josh drive to the 
   junkyard, where Josh makes a phone call to the redneck saying there 
   are some antiques that need to picked up immediately in Denver (Josh 
   give him Brandon's address!). The wait for the redneck to leave in 
   his truck and the two punkers break into the redneck's trailer, but 
   find no guns. They do find a secret passageway in the trailer that 
   leads to a huge underground bunker and they will need to use it when 
   the redneck makes an unexpected return. They see that the bunker is 
   full of automatic weapons and they suddenly hear loud gunshots, 
   thinking that the redneck is shooting at them, so they run further 
   down the bunker until they find what looks to be some type of torture 
   room. They still hear the gunshots, so they hide in the room. The 
   sounds they hear are not shots at all, but the sound of the redneck 
   tipping the refrigerator ass-over-tea kettle until he gets it to the 
   torture room. When he opens the refrigerator, Ray and Josh see that 
   Tasha is inside, still alive but has duct tape over her mouth (it 
   really does have many uses in films!) and is tied-up. The redneck 
   puts Tasha in a special torture chair, but Ray talks Josh out of 
   saving her, because she was going to be one of the targets on 
   Homecoming Night anyway. The redneck hears Ray talking and grabs him 
   (he doesn't see Josh), while Josh hides for his life.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    DAY 11:27 AM:</B> The redneck has Tasha and Ray prisoner. The 
   redneck straps some strange gear on his body (including a mask with a 
   huge beak on it, not unlike the one Nivek Ogre wore in <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#ScreamPark2012">SCREAM
    PARK</A></B> - 2012) and begins to videotape what is about to 
   happen. The redneck pulls off Ray's eyebrows with a pair of pliers 
   (ouch!) while Ray prattles on about how they could work together to 
   kill their enemies. The redneck has heard enough and puts a bullet in 
   Ray's head, killing him, and then leaves the room. Tasha is still 
   alive and Josh tries to save her. The first thing he does is pull the 
   duct tape off her mouth and she screams (the stupid bitch), so Josh 
   puts the duct tape back over her mouth. The redneck returns to the 
   room carrying the corpse of another woman and he screws the corpse on 
   top of a table while watching Woody Woodpecker cartoons (which could 
   explain the mask). The redneck then falls asleep and Josh frees Tasha 
   (who seems to be drugged) and they try to escape the underground 
   bunker, while a groggy Tasha hampers their speed and keeps passing out.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    DAY 3:42 PM:</B> We watch Sammy making some pipe bombs, totally 
   unaware of what has happened to Roy or what Josh is going through. 
   The redneck wakes up and notices that Tasha is missing, so he grabs 
   his pistol and goes looking for her. Josh and Tasha are still in the 
   bunker thanks to Tasha's drugged-out state, but the more they get 
   through the many corridors, the more dead bodies they find, which 
   means that the redneck has been doing this for a very long time. The 
   redneck soon finds the pair and chokes Josh unconscious, while Tasha 
   grabs the redneck's pistol from its holster, but she misses the 
   redneck with her first shot and drops the gun (We could blame the 
   drugs for making her miss, but she was no more than three feet away 
   from him, so even a blind man could have hit him. And she drops the 
   gun because it makes a big bang, proving that it takes a special 
   breed of idiot to become a cheerleader). The redneck knocks her out 
   with one punch. When Josh wakes up, he is tied-up and in an empty hot 
   tub with the redneck. The redneck (who is smarter than you think) has 
   created a machine that will slowly burn Josh's body away as acid 
   fills the tub and he whispers into Josh's ear (the first time we 
   really get a good look at Thompson's face) that he knows what Josh 
   was going to do that night (thanks to Ray telling him), but it looks 
   like he is not going to be there. The redneck flips the switch that 
   turns on the acid machine and Josh can see the acid traveling down 
   some clear tubes. Tasha suddenly appears and hits the redneck over 
   the head several times with a sledgehammer and tries to free Josh, 
   but she's too stupid to figure it out in time and just pumps bullets 
   into the hot tub, so the acid flows out. The redneck wakes up with 
   what is probably Excedrin Headache #1, but Josh and Tasha have 
   booby-trapped the room and the redneck trips it, causing a big metal 
   gate to come flying at the redneck, hitting him hard. Josh and Tasha 
   make it outside by crawling through a window in the trailer, but the 
   redneck grabs Tasha's leg and Josh chains his arm to a pole. Josh and 
   Tasha use a bulldozer to drop a bunch of junked cars on the trailer, 
   killing the redneck. Suddenly, Josh says, &quot;Fuck, it's not over!&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>

    NIGHT 7:15 PM:</B> Josh has to stop Sammy from going through with 
   the massacre, but he doesn't have the keys to the car, so he has to 
   go down to the bunker and get the keys out of Ray's pants pocket (he 
   also leaves a sign in the torture room as a tribute to his two 
   friends). He gets the keys and he and Tasha race back to Denver, but 
   it is 40 miles away and time is coming close to the massacre. Sammy 
   walks into a convenience store, where he asks the nerdy teen behind 
   the counter why he is not at the Homecoming Dance. The teen says 
   &quot;Are you kidding me? Just look at me!&quot; and Sammy shakes his 
   hand (It's a telling moment.). While Sammy is walking down the road, 
   he gets hassled by a cop, who wants to know where he is going 
   (&quot;The Homecoming Dance.&quot;) and why he is dressed that way 
   (&quot;This is the way I always dress.&quot;), but the officer makes 
   his life a living hell, just like the jocks, so he blows up the 
   police car and the officer with a pipe bomb. Josh makes it to the 
   high school just in time and tries to talk Sammy out of the massacre, 
   but then suddenly Josh is woken up by his alarm clock at 6:56 AM, 
   goes to the bathroom and looks at his reflection in the cracked 
   mirror and has breakfast while his parents ignore him. Is Josh caught 
   in a time loop? Turns out that Josh actually talked Sammy out of the 
   massacre and he has become the hero of the school. Donald and the 
   rest of the jocks still treat him like shit, but Josh has a new 
   outlook on life and puts Brandon in his place, something he has never 
   experienced before. Tasha (who is now Josh's girlfriend) yells to 
   Brandon: &quot;Cheerleader pussy...it does rock!&quot; and kisses 
   Josh. Make sure you stay through the end credits, because the final 
   stinger is very important (I'm not going to spoil it for you, except 
   to say that the redneck is not alive), as the title of the film

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">What
    looks like a film that is going to turn into a tale of violent 
   revenge and retribution (Something we have seen much too often in our 
   schools <A HREF="american_terror_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/american terror 2012 poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>the
    past few years, turning our educational system into a virtual prison 
   with &quot;zero tolerance&quot;, such as a fourth grader who drew a 
   gun in art class and was suspended from school. For drawing a gun!!!! 
   Another younger kid took a two week rip for making his thumb and 
   forefinger in the shape of a gun!!!!! That is not &quot;zero 
   tolerance&quot;, that is adult ignorance.) actually turns into a 
   parable about redemption and forgiveness. Everyone, including Josh, 
   can change the future (and sometimes become a hero in the process), 
   but you have to apply yourself and sometimes turn the other cheek. 
   Director/screenwriter/editor/sound designer Haylar Garcia (this was 
   his first feature-length fictional film), was actually an acclaimed 
   musician/songwriter/music producer before he decided to go into 
   filmmaking (I must confess that some of the thrash metal songs 
   playing during some scenes were a distraction to me, but I get the 
   feeling that Garcia was actually speaking to teenagers with this film 
   and not old fogies like myself) and I sincerely hope he sticks with 
   filmmaking, because he actually pulls great performances out of the 
   young cast (This is the first feature film for the actors who play 
   Josh, Ray and Sammy) and holds you in suspense in some scenes. This 
   film is basically serious stuff (but a hand gesture Thompson's 
   character makes sure gave me a good laugh) and teaches both young and 
   old what effect bullying has on people (I know some people who still 
   have emotional scars from being bullied in school and that was over 
   40 years ago. These are emotional wounds that are hard to heal.) This 
   film may not be for all tastes because, at times, it can be a little 
   &quot;torture porny&quot;, but people looking for some social 
   significance to go along with the thriller elements should appreciate 
   this film. It may have cliched portrayals of cheerleaders (Tasha does 
   some really stupid things in this film, but not all cheerleaders are 
   as ditsy as her), but Tasha has one of the best final comeback lines 
   I have heard in quite a while. An enjoyable low-budget film that is 
   as inventive as it is relevant. Besides, any film that makes Charles 
   Manson look like an ass is OK in my book. We are all individuals. We 
   just have to remember that. Also starring James Miller, Michael 
   Haskins, T. Alex Demos, Jennifer Wilde, Kathryn Gould and Troy Alan.

   assistant (Ann Margaret Hughes; <B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#BlueTornado1991">BLUE
    TORNADO</A></B> - 1990) that John is &quot;tedious&quot; and she

    John and Eva can't keep their hands off each other and have sex as 
   much as possible, but they can't hide it from the maid, Rosy 
   (&quot;Roxana Cox&quot;; Real name: Rossana Coggiola), because maids 
   see and know everything that goes on in the homes they work at (Yet, 
   Rosy won't talk to the Police Inspector.). When the Inspector is 
   questioning Angela and Eva, Angela get a phone call from the 
   mysterious man, who tells her he will be visiting her again very 
   soon. For some reason, Angela searches Eva's purse and finds a 
   receipt from a local joke shop, so Angela goes there and purchases a 
   joke cigarette lighter shaped like a small pistol. Oh, and it also 
   shoots blanks. The clerk tells Angela that the cigarette lighter can 
   be dangerous, even deadly, if the blank cartridges were replaced with 
   actual gunpowder (This film is beginning to push the unbelievability 
   factor to eleven, as it telegraphs everything that will come later in 
   the film).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Angela finds a child's doll in her car with a switchblade shoved in 
   its mouth and reports it to the Inspector. She tells Angela that she, 
   too, was sexually assaulted when she was a young girl. We then find 
   out that fifteen years ago, it was a young Angela who was raped by 
   the butcher and her father was arrested for killing her rapist, 
   forcing Angela to spend her teenage years in a &quot;home&quot; until 
   she became of legal age to be on her own. The Inspector apologizes to 
   Angela for judging her too hard, but we then discover that Angela may 
   have indeed killed her rapist fifteen years ago, not her father, who 
   may have taken credit to save his daughter from serving prison time. 
   In flashback, we see someone killing the butcher by using his meat 
   slicer to cut off his hand and then slice his throat open, the blood 
   gushing out like a river.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    John and Eva continue to fuck like rabbits, John telling Eva not to 
   worry about Angela catching them in the act because she takes a 
   handful of sleeping pills every night just before she goes to bed. 
   Not this night, though, as Angela watches from the shadows as her 
   husband and her best friend do the dirty in the swimming pool (I hope 
   there's a lot of chlorine in the water to kill the deposits!). The 
   next morning, Angela is reading the newspaper, where the headline 
   reads &quot;PROJECTIONIST KILLED BY HIT AND RUN DRIVER&quot;. We then 
   see Angela with the mystery man in blue jeans and sunglasses. Turns 
   out he's Angela's brother, David, who everyone thinks is dead. He is 
   actually the one who killed Angela's rapist fifteen years ago and 
   when their father discovered David was the killer, he went to the 
   police and confessed to the crime. We also learn that their father 
   died in jail. It shouldn't come as a surprise that David also killed 
   the projectionist, as we watch Angela give her brother an envelope 
   full of money and an airline ticket to Brazil. She also gives him the 
   joke cigarette lighter as a going away gift (I know what you are 
   thinking and you're right!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Eva tells John to be nice to Angela so she doesn't get suspicious 
   that she won't be around much longer. John then makes love to Angela 
   (Where does he get the stamina?!?), but Angela lies on the bed like a 
   corpse, showing no emotion while John bumps and grinds away. The 
   Inspector's assistant tells her that the dead projectionist worked at 
   the same sex cinema that Angela was raped in and she becomes 
   instantly suspicious. We then discover that Angela and Eva are 
   actually working together to kill John so Angela can inherit all his 
   money and split it with Eva. Rosy hears their plans, but they catch 
   her, chase her down and kill her. As they are shoving her dead body 
   in the trunk of a car, they are almost caught by the Inspector. She 
   tells Angela that Frank Evans was probably her stalker, because since 
   his death, she has had no threats on her life. Does the Inspector 
   really think this or it it only a ruse? John leaves on a business 
   trip and gives Angela a pistol to protect herself if the <A HREF="appointment_in_black_1990.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/appointment in black aka blind date dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>stalker
    should come back when he is gone. We then learn that John is not on 
   a business trip at all, as he meets Eva in a local hotel to prepare 
   for Angela's murder that night. So who's playing who? Are Angela and 
   Eva really together or is Eva actually working with John? Or is this 
   story open for another &quot;twist&quot;? If you want to find out, 
   I'm afraid you'll have to watch the damn film for yourself. I'll just 
   say this: Think of the most outrageous thing that could possibly 
   happen and you are probably correct. Oh, and that joke cigarette 
   lighter? It plays a major role in the film's closing shot.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This cliche-ridden pseudo-giallo flick, an Italy/Germany&nbsp; 
   co-production, has one good thing going for it, namely a ton of 
   full-frontal nudity from the mostly female cast. Director Antonio 
   Bonifacio (who also made another late-in-the-game giallo called <B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#StrangeStoryOlgaO">THE

   during the film's final five minutes, where all logic is tossed out 
   the window in favor of the film's &quot;surprise&quot; final twist. 
   It wasn't a double-cross, a triple-cross or even a quadruple-cross, 
   but a quintuple-cross! I have to say that even though the film is an 
   assault on the brain of any logical thinking person, it is still very 
   easy on the eyes, thanks to the non-stop female nudity. That is by no 
   means a ringing endorsement, but I have certainly seen much worse 
   pseudo-giallo films in&nbsp; my life. So enjoy the non-sensical plot 
   and stay for the constanty naked female flesh. Remember when you

    The job of finding answers falls on pathologist Simona Sanna (Mimsy

    PERFUME OF THE LADY IN BLACK</A></B> - 1974), who is interning at a 
   teaching hospital until she finishes her college thesis on 
   &quot;simulated and authentic suicides&quot; (try not to think too 
   hard about this!). Simona, who is over-worked and over-heated, has a 
   freak-out scene where she imagines all the dead bodies in the morgue 
   come to life and have sex with each other (it must be seen to be 
   believed!). Simona is a new resident at an apartment complex, where 
   she meets her upstairs neighbor, red-headed Betty Lenox (Gaby 
   Wagner), who knocks on Simona's door to borrow an envelope. Betty 
   hears her phone ring, runs upstairs and we can tell by the look on 
   her face that the phone call is trouble. She runs out of the 
   apartment complex, nearly gets raped by two drunk pedestrians, goes 
   to church and then is picked up by someone she knows (but we don't 
   see) . The mystery begins.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next day, Simona is in the morgue when the newest 
   &quot;suicide&quot; is brought to her. It is the body of a young 
   woman who stuck a pistol under her chin and pulled the trigger (We 
   see her face which is missing teeth and one eyeball is hanging out of 
   the socket!). We then watch as demented morgue assistant Ivo (Ernesto 
   Colli; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Tempter">THE TEMPTER</A></B> - 
   1974) fixes her face with putty so the police can take a picture of 
   her for the newspaper (Ivo makes sure that his hand brushes against 
   her cold naked breast). It turns out that this female stiff is the 
   body of Betty Lenox without her red wig. A priest named Father Paul 
   (Barry Primus; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Dion Brothers">THE DION BROTHERS</A></B> 
   - 1974) shows up at the morgue and insists that Betty was murdered 
   and could not have possibly committed suicide because he gave her 
   absolution from her sins the night before. You see, Father Paul's 
   last name is Lenox and Betty was his sister. Simona's 
   photographer/race car driver boyfriend, Riccardo (the late Ray 
   Lovelock; <B><A HREF="#LastHouseBeach">LAST HOUSE ON THE BEACH</A></B> 
   - 1978), recalls that Father Paul was once a famous race car driver 
   that was committed to a mental institution after causing a major 
   accident at a racetrack where people were killed (Riccardo tells 
   Simona that it is not such a far leap from a loony bin to a man of 
   the cloth!). Right away, we see that Father Paul is a sandwich short 
   of a picnic, as he yells to Simona, &quot;Show me some respect! Show 
   me some respect!&quot; when she questions his sanity after seeing him 
   punch out the apartment complex's caretaker (Leonardo Severini) for 
   calling Betty a prostitute. Making matter worse, someone is stalking 
   Simona, trying to kill her. But why?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There are many people who could be the stalker, as they are also 
   hiding secrets of their own. Besides Father Paul and the caretaker 
   (whom we see beating his dog for barking), there's Riccardo, who 
   seems to know more than he is telling; Simona's father, Lello (Carlo 
   Cataneo), who buys a pistol from the caretaker for reasons not yet 
   made clear; Lello's former lover Danielle (Angela Goodwin), who is an 
   artist of grotesque paintings of death (she works at a &quot;criminal 
   museum&quot; that is full of photos of real-life death and wax 
   figures of murderers); Simona's Uncle Gianni (Massimo Serato; <B><A HREF="dont_look_now_1973.htm">DON'T
    LOOK NOW</A></B> - 1973), who lies to Simona on when he arrived in 
   Rome. Even Simona herself is a strange bird, as she cannot make love 
   to Riccardo without seeing the bodies of corpses coming to life. It 
   seems that everyone in this film has secrets they would kill for.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Simona and Father Paul find the caretaker hanging by his neck in his 
   bathroom (he used his belt as a noose). Father Paul tries to revive 
   him (in one of the strangest resuscitation methods that I have ever 
   seen, moving his arms up and down like some air pump!), only to 
   witness him take a final breath before he foams at the mouth and 
   dies. Then Lello jumps (or is pushed out) a window in Betty's 
   apartment and he fractures his back, causing him to become a 
   paraplegic, unable to talk. Just moments before, Lello and Gianni 
   discover a letter written by Betty where she says she wishes she 
   could become Lello's wife, but since she can't, she has taken the 
   only action that makes sense. Yes, this could be looked at as a 
   suicide note, but an important document (a revised will) is missing, 
   which could prove Betty was murdered. Simona and Father Paul decide 
   to hook up Lello with an experimental machine that will enable him to 
   answer questions with his eye movements. Once hooked up to the 
   machine, they ask him if he tried to commit suicide, but all he is 
   able to communicate are the letters &quot;SIMONASEI&quot; before he 
   convulses and dies, foaming at the mouth just like the caretaker did 
   (The letters are part of a quotation in Italian, but it is not 
   translated for English speaking audiences. It really doesn't matter, though.).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The reveal of the killer is a cheat on the audience, as we are never 
   clued-in on the killer's motivations until the film's final minutes. 
   It seems that Riccardo was injecting people with a deadly paralytic 
   agent to cover up the fact that he killed his father years earlier so 
   he could inherit his father's fortune. Betty had his father's revised 
   will, which disinherited Riccardo (which is why Betty wanted to 
   borrow an envelope from Simona). He killed everyone to get his hands 
   on that will to destroy it. <A HREF="autopsy_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/autopsy 1973 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>His
    last act is to inject Simona and Father Paul with the agent, strip 
   them nude, put them in Simona's bathroom and turn on the gas to make 
   it look like a double suicide. Only God is on the side of Father Paul 
   and Simona. They miraculously revive and ruin Riccardo's plans. He 
   dies by falling off scaffolding on top of an old church after getting 
   into a scuffle with Father Paul. Riccardo's final image is of 
   tourists crowding around his crushed body.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While we are never given a valid reason why some people are 
   committing mass suicide, Simona theorizes that it has something to do 
   with the solar flares that are causing the heatwave (It's a 
   throw-away line that is the only part of the film that is in Italian 
   with English subtitles). Every time someone kills themselves, we are 
   shown close-ups of solar flares shooting off the Sun. Besides the 
   sudden reveal of the killer and his motivations, this is an 
   atmospheric and creepy delight. It has wall-to-wall full frontal male 
   and female nudity and the music score, by Oscar&reg;-winning composer 
   Ennio Morricone (who wrote the my favorite score of all time, the 
   soundtrack to <B><A HREF="duck_you_sucker_1971.htm">DUCK, YOU SUCKER</A></B>

   Klondike (Harrison Page; <B><A HREF="lionheart_1990.htm">LIONHEART</A></B>

   While they are getting drunk at the house, Klondike throws Frank an 
   envelope and tells him it contains a USB drive (Frank has no idea 
   what that is), explaining that if anything happens to him, he should 
   turn it over to someone he trusts. When Klondike leaves the house to 
   pick up a pack of Camels, he is shot dead by two guys looking for the 
   USB drive. They work for Panther (Charles S. Dutton; <B><A HREF="mimic_1997.htm">MIMIC</A></B>

   illegally. When Frank is notified of Klondike's death, he goes to the 
   police precinct to see what progress they are making. After being 
   assured everything is being done and then watching the detectives 
   playing a game of foam basketball in the precinct's break room, Frank 
   decides to take the law into his own hands. He becomes friends with 
   foul-mouthed kid Martin (John Duffy), who lives next door with his 
   physically abused mother Amber (Joyful Drake), who gets beat-up by 
   her boyfriend nearly every night. When Frank steps in and stops one 
   of those beatings, it becomes apparent that Frank and Amber will 
   become much more than friends (even though he is old enough to be her 
   father, but Trejo pulls it off magnificently). Martin shows Frank how 
   to use the USB drive that Klondike gave him and discovers Panther and 
   the Mayor's plan for their neighborhood. Frank gives the USB drive to 
   the only cop he trusts, Patrol Officer Malark (Patrick Fabian), who 
   Frank has gone on many &quot;ride-alongs&quot; with and have built-up

   walking out of the house, he says to the goon, &quot;I hope you're a 
   righty!&quot;, one of the film's many little jokes that make this 
   film a joy to watch). Trouble is, Panther is waiting for him at the 
   warehouse and some more goons knock Frank out. When Frank wakes up, 
   he is connected to an electrical torture device (shades of <B><A HREF="lethal_weapon_1987.htm">LETHAL
    WEAPON</A></B> - 1987) and is shocked to give up the location of the 
   USB drive, Panther not knowing that Frank was tortured the same way 
   during his time as a POW and was never broken. Frank breaks free and 
   blows up the warehouse, which leads to Panther and Frank stealing 
   busses (Well, Panther really only steals a bus, as Frank is happily 
   offered another bus because the driver recognizes him as &quot;Bad 
   Ass&quot;!). A bus chase ensues (the only disappointing part of the 
   film, because it is obvious that this footage was cribbed from the 
   Schwarzenegger film <B><A HREF="red_heat_1988.htm">RED HEAT</A></B> - 
   1988 and digitally altered to substitute Los Angeles for Chicago), 
   both of them crashing the busses. Panther heads to Frank's home to 
   kill Amber, but Franks stops him in the nick of time, beating the 
   crap out of Panther. The next day the Mayor is arrested, thanks to 
   Officer Malark turning over the USB drive to the right people, 
   everyone else is brought to justice and Frank becomes an honorary 
   police officer.&nbsp; Not just a revenge film, but also an essay on 
   how we are so dependent on &quot;instant access&quot; in the Internet 
   Age, this thriller/action/comedy, directed and written by Craig Moss (<B><A HREF="breaking_wind_2012.htm">BREAKING

   thousands of half-eaten fish are discovered washed ashore, Papa Jack 
   tries to cover it up with the help of some shady looking characters 
   wearing dark suits and sunglasses, but things take a turn for the 
   worse when the townspeople begin to get sick and act out violently, 
   like they have lost control of their emotions (something that was 
   covered more thoroughly in the similarly-themed film <B><A HREF="impulse_1984.htm">IMPULSE</A></B> 
   [1984]). As more people end up dead at the beach, Mike is now getting 
   help from the Sheriff when the water samples Mike collected turn out 
   to have an unknown trace element that seems to change the behavior of

    BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE</A></B> - 1962), who has been treating far 
   more sick patients than normal, only to discover that Dr. Snow may 
   just be the driving force behind all this secrecy. Mike, Eliza and 
   the Sheriff try to get outside help, but the subversive 
   powers-that-be do a pretty good job of covering it up, killing Mike 
   and the Sheriff in a typical nihilistic ending that the 70's so loved 
   to give audiences.&nbsp; This slow-moving thriller, directed by Harry 
   Kerwin, who co-wrote and produced with star Wayne Crawford (Crawford 
   is also credited with directing the underwater scenes), really 
   doesn't have much to recommend and seems to suffer from severe edits 
   to achieve a PG rating. As usual, Crawford sleepwalks throughout the 
   entire film and looks bored (or stoned) whenever he is on-screen. 
   Both Harry Kerwin, brother William (who also acted using the name 
   &quot;Thomas Wood&quot;) and Crawford (who occasionally acted using 
   the name &quot;Scott Lawrence&quot;) have worked together several 
   times before, most notably in Harry's two underrated films, <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#God's Bloody Acre">GOD'S
    BLOODY ACRE</A></B> (1975) and <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Tomcats1976">TOMCATS</A></B> 
   (1976), which makes <B><A HREF="barracuda_1977.htm">BARRACUDA</A></B> 
   a bitter disappointment in comparison. The violence here, unlike the 
   previous two films, is sparse and uninspired (the barracuda attacks 
   consists of someone shaking the camera while fake blood is released 
   into the water, followed by close-ups of obviously fake barracuda's 
   open mouths) and notable edits (even the music soundtrack jumps, 
   which seems to indicate that the films PG rating was decided after 
   post-production) robs the viewers of any carnage. The 70's turned out 
   a lot of &quot;They Are Us&quot; conspiracy thrillers thanks to 
   Watergate and it's aftermath, but <B><A HREF="barracuda_1977b.htm">BARRACUDA</A></B> 
   is one of the weakest of the lot. One funny scene shows Mike turning 
   down a roll in the hay with Eliza because he doesn't want to 
   disrespect her father by screwing her in his house. Now I've heard

    OF THE CATS</A><A NAME="BecauseOfTheCats"></A> (1973) -</B> 
   Compelling thriller about a gang of well-dressed young men who rob 
   and rape wealthy people and the police inspector who is determined to 
   catch them. When the film opens, we watch as the six youths break 
   into the home of a wealthy couple and gang-rape the woman while 
   forcing the husband to watch. As the wife tells her story to 
   Amsterdam Police Inspector van der Valk (Bryan Marshall; <B><A HREF="punisher_1989.htm">THE
    PUNISHER</A></B> - 1989), she remembers something unusual that one 
   of the masked youths said when he refused to take part in her rape: 
   &quot;The cats won't like it.&quot; The Inspector, who believes the 
   youths are well-bred and perform the robberies and rapes strictly for 
   kicks (they especially seem to find joy in destroying property more 
   than stealing it), begins his unorthodox investigation, first 
   sleeping with an expensive call girl named Feodora (Alexandra 
   Stewart) to get clues as to who these spoiled youths may be. It turns 
   out that the Inspector's suspicions were correct. Each one of these 
   youths comes from a well-to-do family and they have bonded together, 
   calling themselves &quot;The Ravens&quot;. The only problem the 
   Inspector has is getting proof, since he runs into brick walls when 
   trying to get anyone to s<A HREF="because_of_the_cats_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/because of the cats poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="168" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>pill
    the beans, since the kids' influential families can ruin them for 
   life. The newest recruit to The Ravens, Kees van Sonneveld (Nicholas 
   Hoye), may be the one person that breaks under the Inspector's 
   questioning, but first the Inspector must navigate the unfamiliar 
   world of society's rich, where the parents of the youths are just as 
   corrupt (if not more so) as their children. The parents put pressure 
   on the Inspector's superiors to get him to back off, but he keeps 
   chugging ahead trying to find out the meaning of &quot;The cats won't 
   like it.&quot; The rest of The Ravens mistakenly believe that Kees 
   has spilled his guts to the Inspector, so they try to kill him by 
   running his scooter off the road, but he manages to escape. When Kees 
   is eventually found dead on the beach dressed in scuba gear, the 
   Inspector knows The Ravens are responsible, but will have a hard time 
   proving it, so he begins his own intimidation campaign against them. 
   Eric (Anthony Allen), the leader of The Ravens, begins an 
   intimidation campaign of his own, threatening Feodora for talking to 
   (and sleeping with) the Inspector. She finds her pet cats graphically 
   slaughtered in her apartment, a warning to keep her mouth shut or she 
   will be next. The truth is eventually exposed and the Inspector 
   arrests The Ravens for murder, but he also discovers just who the 
   &quot;Cats&quot; are (I won't spoil it for you) and that The Ravens 
   weren't acting on their own. They also have a Manson-like leader who 
   was guiding their every move. Can the Inspector find enough evidence 
   to bring this monster down?&nbsp; This slow, methodical thriller, 
   directed and produced by Fons Rademakers (whose 1986 film, <B><A HREF="assault_1986.htm">THE
    ASSAULT</A></B>, won the Academy Award for best foreign film in 
   1987), begins with a graphically unpleasant and hard-to-watch gang 
   rape (which is edited out of some prints) and then proceeds to give 
   the viewers clues as to why these spoiled, privileged brats do what 
   they do. The screenplay, by Hugo Claus (based on a novel by Nicolas 
   Freeling), is not only an indictment against the wealthy and the 
   influence they hold over the common people, it's also an indictment 
   against parental neglect. Some parents, like Kees' father, are never 
   around (he's not even available to the police when his son is found 
   dead), some are protective only because they don't want their family 
   name sullied and some just don't give a shit. While the violence 
   (besides the rape) is fairly restrained (the shots of Feodora's 
   slaughtered cats is the bloodiest this film gets), the nudity, 
   including both full-frontal male and female, is graphic and borders 
   on pornography in some scenes (It was originally Rated X when 
   submitted to the MPAA and had to be shorn of some footage to receive 
   an R-rating). The final thirty minutes, where The Ravens' 
   Svengali-like leader is exposed and we witness a flashback involving 
   Kees' murder, an orgy and a ritualistic cat sacrifice, is about as 
   sexually graphic as a film can get without being covered in a plain 
   brown wrapper. While some of the ideals and morality (not to mention 
   the fashions) may seem dated today, <B><A HREF="because_of_the_cats_1973b.htm">BECAUSE
    OF THE CATS</A></B> is still an entertaining mix of heady themes 
   that makes for a satisfying thriller. The mod, brassy score, by Ruud 
   Bos, is also a highlight. Also starring Edward Judd, Sebastian Graham 
   Jones, Derek Hart, Christopher Blake, Delia Lindsay, Roger Hammond, 
   George Baker and Sylvia Kristel, who plays an important role in the 
   film's conclusion, besides being completely nude for the majority of 
   her screen time. Originally available on VHS from <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Prism">Prism

    Arabella (model Tini Cansino; who is called &quot;Deborah&quot; in 
   the English dub, so I will call her that in this review) is married 
   to novelist Francesco Veronese (Francesco Casale), who is permanently 
   in a wheelchair, put there when Deborah decided to give him oral sex 
   while he is driving away from the church they just got married in, 
   causing him to get into a bad car wreck and losing the use of his 
   legs. Francesco hasn't made love to Deborah since the accident, 
   causing her to look for sexual thrills on her own in the middle of 
   the night. On one of those nights, Deborah visits an S&amp;M 
   whorehouse and she watches, spellbound, people performing degrading 
   acts on each other (A woman shoving a baton up a male client's ass; 
   two gay men wrestling with each other; a two man, one woman 
   m&eacute;nage a trois). Two men then walk up to Deborah and begin to 
   feel her up. She likes it, but when she is slapped by one of the men, 
   she tells him to stop (it is an S&amp;M whorehouse, after all) and he 
   pulls out a switchblade, pressing it up against he neck. Luckily for 
   Deborah, the police raid the joint. Deborah hides and when she thinks 
   it is safe, she sneaks back to her car, only to get collared by a 
   cop. As the cop slaps the handcuffs on her, putting her hands behind 
   her back, she pleads with him, saying she is not a prostitute, she 
   just came to pick up a friend. The cop then rapes her (standing up, 
   the Italian's favorite way of having sex, at least in films of this 
   type) and when he is done, he removes the handcuffs and says, 
   &quot;You were right, you are not a whore!&quot;, telling her to go 
   home. The whole time this is happening, a Private Detective (Giose 
   Davi) is snapping away with his camera, taking photos of Deborah, but 
   who hired him?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next morning, Deborah makes breakfast for Francesco and brings 
   it to his home office, where he sits by a typewriter, suffering from 
   a severe case of writer's block. He screams at Deborah, telling her 
   to get out of the room (&quot;Look at my wife. She's in love with a 
   cripple!&quot;). She runs out of the room in tears and Francesco's 
   mother, Marta (Evelyn Stewart; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightChild1975">THE
    NIGHT CHILD</A></B> - 1975), comforts her, saying her son will 
   apologize to her because he's a good boy at heart. The buzzer to the 
   front gate of their home goes off and Deborah can see by the security 
   camera that it is the cop who raped her the night before (she dropped 
   her purse when he raped her, which is how he knew where she lived). 
   Deborah runs to the front gate and offers the cop money to go away. 
   He's not interested in money, he just wants more of Deborah's sweet 
   body. Deborah tells him not here, as her husband might see them and 
   leads him to a nearby shed, where they begin to do the nasty. 
   Meanwhile, Francesco has come to apologize and when he can't find his 
   wife, he wheels himself outside, even though his mother tells him not 
   to. Francesco spies on his wife making love to the cop, but what he 
   doesn't expect is what Deborah will do next. Just as the cop is about 
   to climax, Deborah hits him over the head with a mallet, killing him. 
   This act of violence snaps Francesco out of his writer's block, 
   creating a character called the &quot;Black Angel&quot;, about a 
   female vigilante who kills men who deserves to be killed, but he 
   needs more material to finish the novel, so he sends his wife out in 
   the night and when she comes back home, she tells him what she did 
   and saw that night, which Francesco &quot;fictionalizes&quot;, giving 
   his novel an air of realism.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    About the time this is all going on, a serial killer, who the press 
   have dubbed the &quot;Scissors Murderer&quot;, is killing men at 
   night cutting off their penises (!), beginning with the Private 
   Detective we saw back at the S&amp;M whorehouse. Female Police 
   Inspector Gina Fowler (Valentina Visconti) is put in charge of 
   finding the Scissors Murderer, but she has a secret that she only 
   tells to her lesbian lover and police partner, Agnese (Rena Niehaus; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DamnedInVenice1978">DAMNED
    IN VENICE</A></B> - 1978): When she was a young girl, she saw her 
   mother cut off her father's penis for being a serial adulterer. Not 
   one to keep a secret and looking to advance her career, Agnese 
   betrays her lesbian partner and tells her secret to the press, where 
   it makes the front page on all the newspapers the following morning, 
   calling Gina the Scissors Murderer. Sure enough, Gina is pulled off 
   the case and Agnese is now in charge, but something happens which 
   makes Gina look like the serial killer that even the police can't 
   ignore. The real Scissors Murderer calls Gina's phone, not knowing 
   she has been discharged from the force, and talks to Agnese, who 
   pretends to be Gina. She agrees to meet the killer that night, as he 
   has something he wants to give to Gina. Stupid dyke. Agnese is 
   viciously murdered that night and guess who's the prime suspect? 
   That's right, it's Gina and the police have issued an all points 
   bulletin for her arrest. Gina, who is hiding and trying to find the 
   serial killer on her own to prove her innocence, has a friend on the 
   force, a male detective named De Rosa (Carlo Mucari; <B><A HREF="bridge_to_hell_1986.htm">BRIDGE
    TO HELL</A></B> - 1986). She asks him to give her 24 hours to find 
   the real killer and if she doesn't, she will turn herself in. So what 
   does this have to do with Deborah and Francesco? This is where the 
   believability-straining coincidences come into play (besides the big 
   one I have just described).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    About two-thirds into the movie, we find out that Gina is 
   Francesco's sister (!). Think about that for a moment (I'll 
   wait)...... But, wait! It turns out that Francesco was never 
   crippled, he can walk! It turns out that he wasn't hurt in the 
   accident, he was pretending because, as he tells Deborah, it gave him 
   ideas for a book. Think about that for a moment (I'll wait)...... 
   Yes, he purposely didn't make love to his wife all for the sake<A HREF="black_angel_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/black angel italy vhs front2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="187" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   of his book! So why did he have writer's block??? So who is the 
   killer? It's not that hard to figure out (Gina's Mother + Dad's Penis 
   = Francesco's Mother). About the only surprise this film offers is 
   when Francesco makes love to Deborah outside at night and Marta, who 
   was following Deborah every night and doesn't know her son can walk, 
   stabs Francesco in the back, killing him, thinking he was a rapist 
   attacking Deborah! The next time we see Deborah, she is back at the 
   S&amp;M whorehouse, only this time she is a changed woman, much 
   different than she was when she first walked into the joint. Is it 
   possible she inherited her mother-in-law's penchant for cutting off 
   penises? Is she the new Scissors Murderer?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   You gotta love a film that opens with a nude Barbara Bouchet getting 
   a full body massage from a blind man (and getting aroused by it!). 
   Bouchet portrays Maria Zani, who we next see getting slapped around 
   by her husband, Paolo (Silvano Tranquili), after he receives nude 
   photographs of her with another man. After accusing her <A HREF="black_belly_of_the_tarantula_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/black belly of the tarantula dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="174" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>of
    being a nymphomaniac and telling her he is being blackmailed, he 
   demands to know the man's name, but she refuses to tell him. We then 
   see some unknown person, wearing a trench coat, a big floppy hat and 
   flesh-colored latex gloves, preparing a long needle, then creeping 
   into Maria's house and inserting it into the back of her neck, 
   paralyzing her. As she lays motionless on her bed, she can only watch 
   (she can't even scream) as the killer slowly stabs her in the stomach 
   and moves the blade upwards, killing her. Police Inspector Tellini 
   (Giancarlo Giannini) interviews Paolo and finds out he and Maria were 
   separated for three months. Tellini also finds a torn half of the 
   blackmail photo, showing only a nude Maria and the mystery 
   gentleman's hands, but Tellini finds a smudge in the upper right hand 
   of the photo, which turns out to be a clue. Paolo has the other half 
   of the photo and hires a private investigator to find out the man's 
   name and where he lives. The killer then murders another female 
   victim, using the same method that was used on Maria: A paralyzing 
   needle to the neck followed by a knife to the stomach. Tellini can 
   find no connection between the latest victim (a cocaine trafficker) 
   and Maria. Paolo is considered the main suspect, but after professing 
   his innocence to Tellini, he goes on the lam and swears to find the 
   real killer. Tellini breaks one case (cocaine being transported in 
   containers of tarantulas!), but it brings him no closer to unmasking 
   the killer (he does learn about the symbiotic relationship between 
   tarantulas and wasps, though, which he will learn later is also an 
   important clue). Paolo, with the help of the private investigator, 
   finds his wife's lover in the photo, but a series of mishaps results 
   in Paolo falling off the roof of a highrise building and dying, while 
   the lover is run over by the killer (who's driving a red sportscar) 
   as Tellini is chasing him. Tellini discovers that all the killings 
   may be tied to a blackmail ring, but the killer keeps knocking-off 
   any potential witnesses. When the killer tries to take Tellini's life 
   (with a runaway pipe truck), Tellini must find a way to stop the 
   killer before it becomes even more personal.&nbsp; This early 70's

   contains all the giallo staples: A mysterious gloved killer, some 
   brutal murders, plenty of red herrings and lots of nudity. Scripter 
   Lucile Laks also puts us deep into Inspector Tellini's personal life,

   one point, sells all the furniture in their apartment, leaving them 
   only with a bed (!), but it proves <A HREF="black_belly_of_the_tarantula_1971b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/black belly of the tarantula poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="233" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>to
    be an integral part of the film. When Tellini discovers homemade 
   movies the dead blackmailer had in his apartment, the whole detective

   and anger from Tellini. Throughout the film, Tellini tells his wife 
   that he's going to quit the force because he feels that he's not 
   &quot;up to it&quot;, but time and time again he proves to us that he 
   is probably the smartest man in the department. The murders, while 
   not particularly gory, are still brutal in their execution; the 
   beautiful Barbara Bouchet's (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CryOfAProstitute">CRY

   important clue to the killer's identity. Also, the use of primary

   Frederic follows Melinda into her apartment complex, where he 
   brutally kills her using karate moves and slamming her head 
   over-and-over on a stair bannister. High-price call girl Karen (Raina 
   Barrett; <B><A HREF="stigma_1972.htm">STIGMA</A></B> - 1972) descends 
   the stairs after her weekly meeting in the penthouse with her wealthy 
   john and spots Frederic in the complex entrance (but she doesn't see 
   the murder), even offering to make a date with him in the future 
   (Frederic follows her home to find out where she lives). It turns out 
   that Melinda was the daughter of crooked Congressman Powers (William

   of the newspapers. Since Rearson is as crooked as a corkscrew, he 
   agrees, but he has to contend with Lieutenant Tommy Blade (John 
   Marley; <B><A HREF="car_1977.htm">THE CAR</A></B> - 1977), a 
   no-nonsense honest cop (practically the only one in this film) who 
   decides to investigate Melinda's murder his own way after arresting 
   Henry and knowing he is not the killer (Reardon threatens to put in 
   Blade's retirement papers if he doesn't listen to him). Blade is a 
   divorced cop who lives with much younger novelist Maggie (Kathryn 
   Walker) and doesn't see his young son as much as he should (He 
   confiscates a .22 caliber zip gun off his son, which will prove handy 
   later on). Blade gets a call and pays a visit to Black Panther-type 
   leader Chris (an early role for Morgan Freeman), who tells him that 
   he better release Henry, otherwise there will be a black militant 
   uprising. Blade treats everyone the same: He says what he means and 
   doesn't care what the consequences are. When Frederic murders Karen 
   (he gives her a few katate chops and kicks, then strangles her with a 
   telephone cord) so she can't identify him to the police, only Blade 
   notices the similarities between Melinda and Karen's deaths. Another 
   crooked cop, also on Congressman Powers' payroll, steals Karen's red 
   appointment book (which could sink the Congressman's presidential 
   aspirations) and locks it in his car's glove compartment (but he 
   doesn't even bother locking his car doors!). Blade picks the glove 
   compartment lock and steals the appointment book, which is a treasure 
   trove of important information. Meanwhile, female secretary Jill 
   Connors (Karen Machon) knows something is hinky with new hire 
   Frederic Peterson and does some investigation into his background 
   with the help of ex-CIA operative Gail (a cameo by Rue McClanahan) 
   and discovers that Frederic Peterson's name is actually Frederic 
   Powers and he was dishonorably discharged from the Marines during the 
   Korean War for the brutal beating death of a Korean girl. Yes, 
   Frederic is actually Congressman Powers' brother and the Congressman 
   has been<A HREF="blade_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/blade video gems vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="136" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   covering-up Frederic's murderous ways ever since he was released from 
   a mental institution after the war. Frederic was sent to live with 
   his elderly Aunt Cynthia (Katherine Squire), who makes sure he stays 
   out of trouble (she doesn't do such a good job). When Frederic kills 
   Jill and then Aunt Cynthia (for ratting on him to his brother), he 
   sets up Blade (who quits the police force in disgust) for a final 
   showdown in a wooded park with Maggie as bait, where he beats the 
   snot out of Blade before Blade shoots him dead with the zip gun. A 
   final on-screen scrawl tells us that Congressman Powers won the 
   election by only 1,800 votes and Blade was found not guilty of 
   murdering Frederic (after Reardon and several cops were convicted of 
   corruption), being reinstated to the police force.&nbsp; First of 
   all, the print used by Code Red, although shown in its proper aspect 
   ratio, is a total mess (They did much better with their uncut DVD 
   version of director Bert I. Gordon's <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Mad Bomber">THE
    MAD BOMBER</A></B> - 1972 [under its alternate title <B><A HREF="police_connection_1972b.htm">THE
    POLICE CONNECTION</A></B>], which was butchered for U.S. TV and 
   VHS). It is full of emulsion scratches and dirt (even a hair or two), 
   is missing some frames (which makes us miss some dialogue here and 
   there) and even shows us the reel change dots in the upper right hand 
   of the screen (Code Red founder Bill Olsen wants us to believe this 
   is a grindhouse experience, as it is apparent that no restoration at 
   all was even applied to the film's less-than-stellar celluloid 
   elements). There's not much action in the film and even less 
   violence, just Frederic kicking the shit out of women and Blade (it 
   is brutal, but not as bloody as it could have been). There is plenty 
   of nudity, though, including Karen's ditzy porn actress roommate, 
   Claudell (Geri Miller), who is topless in all her scenes (Steve 
   Landesberg puts in a comedic appearance as Claudell's porn director). 
   The film looks like it was edited with a trowel, as one scene jumps 
   to the next, many of them without any connective tissue at all (The 
   majority of the film also looks to have been lensed with hand-held 
   cameras). John Marley is good in the role (much of his dialogue seems 
   improvised), but his attire, including wearing a hankerchief around 
   his neck like it was a tie, definitely shows the film's early-70's 
   roots. <B><A HREF="blade_1972_ring_of_death_1969_dvd.htm">BLADE</A></B> 
   doesn't quite deliver as a thriller, action or exploitation film. It 
   feels more like a 70's TV cop movie with added nudity and curse 
   words. It's good as a time capsule (many of the actors here have 
   since passed away), but not much else. Also starring Michael McGuire,

   young boys pressuring another young boy to enter the basement of what 
   is probably a haunted house. They tease him by repeating. &quot;You're
    a female! You're a female!...&quot; and throw a tennis ball down the

   go down the stairs and get the ball. The young boy slowly walks down

   to such genre films as <B><A HREF="mountain_of_the_cannibal_god_1978.htm">THE
    MOUNTAIN OF THE CANNIBAL GOD</A></B> [1978]; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Alien 2">ALIEN
    2: ON EARTH</A></B> [1980] and many others, sometimes using the name 
   &quot;Oliver Onions&quot;) The only other person around, who lives in 
   a guest house next to the villa, is caretaker Giovanni (Stanko 
   Molnar; Bava's <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Macabre1980">MACABRE</A></B> 
   - 1980), who basically keeps to himself, even though he looks 
   sinister. When Bruno goes to sit at his piano and record his first 
   session to the soundtrack, he notices that a nude photo of one of the 
   women in his girly magazines has been sliced-up (We earlier see an 
   unknown person with one of those retractable X-Acto knives [the kind 
   that &quot;clicks&quot; when you move the blade up or down], slicing 
   up that picture while Bruno is not present), but Bruno thinks it was 
   Giovanni and one of his quirks and continues composing. Bruno think 
   that Giovanni is the only other person around. That is, until he 
   finds Katia (Valeria Cavalli; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#MotherOfTears">MOTHER
    OF TEARS</A></B> - 2007) hiding in one of his closets (She is a 
   neighbor from down the road and wanted to meet her new neighbor). 
   Before they can talk, Tony calls on the phone and Katia goes to use 
   the bathroom, but when Bruno is done talking to Tony, Katia has 
   disappeared. He discovers Katia's diary in the closet and begins 
   reading it, where she says that she is about to reveal a big secret 
   to someone very soon. Bruno continues to record the soundtrack, while 
   a killer with the same X-Acto knife attacks Katia outside, slicing 
   her face and her hand, but she gets away, only to get caught behind 
   some chicken wire fencing where the killer graphically cuts Katia's 
   stomach and slices her throat through the openings in the chicken 
   wire. Bruno can't hear her screams because he is playing the piano 
   and recording it. He plays back his recording while the killer is 
   dragging the dead corpse of Katia away, where he hears a strange 
   abnormality on the tape. It sounds like a woman's voice, but he can 
   only make out &quot;Secret...yes, Linda...no one must know&quot; and 
   writes it down on a piece of paper (It seems to be almost the same 
   thing Katia wrote in her diary). Bruno steps outside to smoke a 
   cigarette and nearly catches the killer dragging Katia's body away, 
   but when he steps back inside to find droplets of blood on his pants, 
   he goes outside again to discover even more blood, but no body. He 
   once again returns to the inside of the villa, only to find his 
   recording destroyed and pages from Katia's diary burning in the 
   fireplace. Someone is trying to cover up their tracks. Bruno's 
   actress girlfriend, Julia (Lara Naszinski; Lucio Fulci's <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Aenigma1987">AENIGMA</A></B> 
   - 1987), pays him a surprise visit, and when he mentions that Katia 
   payed him a visit and he thinks she now may be dead, she acts like a 
   jealous bitch and&nbsp; leaves (not even caring that Katia, whom she 
   thinks Bruno believes is more beautiful than her, may have been 
   murdered). Bruno does some research and discovers that a woman named 
   Linda rented the villa before him and Tony tells him that he put some 
   of her stuff in a locked room in the cellar. Tony tells him to forget 
   about the room and finish his music soundtrack when Bruno asks for 
   the key. Katia's friend Angela (Fabiola Toledo; Bava's <B><A HREF="demons_1986_starmaker_vhs.htm">DEMONS</A></B> 
   - 1985) stops at the villa to talk to Bruno and ask if she can <A HREF="blade_in_the_dark_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/blade in the dark dvd9a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>use
    the pool. Bruno has no objections and we then see the killer 
   watching Angela strip naked in the pool-house to get into her bathing 
   suit. While Angela is swimming in the pool, she discovers the X-Acto 
   knife at the bottom and places it at the edge of the pool. Bruno has 
   made a trip to the film studio, where both we and Bruno discover that 
   the scene we saw at the beginning of the film with the three boys is 
   actually part of the final reel of Sandra's horror film, while Bruno 
   plays the scene in forward and reverse to get a sense on how to score 
   it (What the two mean boys call the other boy turns out to be a major 
   clue as to who the killer is). The killer, who we now discover has 
   hands with red nail polish and wears a nice pair of black pumps, 
   plunges a knife into Angela's hand while she is washing her hair in a 
   sink, pinning her hand to the counter. The killer murders Angela by 
   putting a clear plastic bag over her head and banging her cranium 
   over and over on the porcelain sink until the plastic bag fills with 
   her blood (there's a particularly nasty scene of the knife that is 
   pinning Angela's hand slicing it until her hand is free). The killer 
   pulls the knife out of the counter and cuts Angela's throat for good 
   measure. Eerily, the killer seems to be disturbed by all the blood 
   that is scattered throught the bathroom (and it is a lot!) and takes 
   the time to clean it up before leaving. Now is the time I ask readers 
   a few questions, because I never give away the ending of a giallo 
   film in my reviews. Here are the questions: Is the mysterious Linda 
   involved because she is hiding something (or someone) in that locked 
   room in the basement? Is Julia so jealous that she will kill any 
   woman who gets close to her boyfriend (she shows up during the final 
   third of the film holding a big knife)? Is Sandra using Bruno as a 
   pawn to come up with a good final act to her film? Could Bruno 
   actually be the killer since we never see him and the killer in the 
   same shot (not even when he discovers the blood on his pants)? What 
   about Giovanni, as we never see him leave the property or even have a 
   girlfriend? And what does a cedar chest full of tennis balls have to 
   do with it all? I've given you more than enough clues. Now you need 
   to figure it out.&nbsp; Actually, the killer's identity is rather 
   easy to figure out since there are precious too few red herrings. I'm 
   not going to tell you who it is, but it all makes sense in the end. 
   Lamberto Bava borrows many themes from other giallo and slasher 
   films, but he gives us some wince-inducing moments here, especially 
   Angela's pinned hand slowly being sliced open between her fingers as 
   the killer is bashing her head in, putting pressure on her hand to 
   move backwards, as the camera lovingly stays on the hand as it is 
   being sliced open. As a giallo film, this is just average and full of 
   holes (The villa that Bruno is living in is supposed to be secluded, 
   but he sure gets a lot of visitors and it seems to be a short car 
   ride to the film studio), but it is still entertaining nonetheless. 
   The trick here is that every person in the film holds some type of 
   bladed weapon at one time or another in the film, so any of them 
   could be the killer but, as the film progresses and the small cast 
   begins getting killed, it is obvious at the halfway point that only 
   one person could be the killer. There's a quite surprising death in 
   the finale, but I will not spoil it for you, other than to say I 
   thought that person would survive. The film made its premiere in 
   edited form on VHS from <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Lightning Video">Lightning
    Video</A> and then was released supposedly uncut on VHS and DVD 
   early in the New Millennium by Anchor Bay Entertainment in a 
   104-minute version. Blue Underground then gained home video rights 
   and delivered a beautiful fully uncut 109-minute version in 
   anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) from original vault materials. If you 
   are a giallo completist (and what genre fan isn't?), then <B><A HREF="blade_in_the_dark_1983c.htm">A

   This is probably the sleaziest and bloodiest film to ever receive a 
   PG (or GP) rating. As I was watching it, all I could do is think 
   about how the MPAA must have been napping when this film was 
   submitted for a rating. The film open with an unseen killer murdering 
   a women sleeping in bed with the claw end of a hammer (the 
   imaginative POV shots are taken from the perspective of the hand 
   holding the hammer) and then setting fire to the room. Ellie (Melody 
   Patterson), the dead woman's wise-ass daughter, looks to find out who 
   killed her mother, even though she knows her mother was the town 
   slut. Since Ellie is underage,<A HREF="blood_and_lace_1971b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/blood and lace dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="153" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   she gets put in the orphanage run by Mrs. Deere (Gloria Grahame; <B><A HREF="nesting_1980.htm">THE
    NESTING</A></B> - 1980), who receives a $150 a month stipend for 
   every orphan she houses. That's all fine and dandy, until we find out 
   that Mrs. Deere likes to spend the money on herself and leaves the 
   orphans hungry most of the time and is not above killing those who 
   try to run away. She simply puts their bodies in the basement freezer 
   and puts them in the infirmary when the clueless Dr. Mullins (Milton 
   Selzer) comes to visit to take his monthly head count. When Ellie 
   arrives there, she almost immediately knows something wrong is going 
   on (it doesn't help that she finds one poor girl chained up in the 
   attic, dying of thirst). Ellie strikes up a friendship with fellow 
   orphan Walter (Ronald Taft) and makes an enemy in female orphan Bunch 
   (Terri Messina), who has a crush on Walter. Meanwhile, Tom (Len 
   Lesser), the orphanage handyman, has just chopped-off the hand of a 
   runaway orphan with a meat cleaver, which upsets Mrs. Deere. Not 
   because he chopped-off the hand, but because the orphan got away! 
   Mrs. Deere will do anything to keep collecting $150 per orphan. It 
   doesn't matter if they are dead or alive, but she must have a body. 
   As Ellie investigates further, she becomes aware of Mrs. Deere's evil 
   doings and finds out that when the orphan supply becomes low, parents 
   turn up dead in town. Is it possible that Mrs. Deere is responsible 
   for Ellie's mother's death? If you think you have it figured out, 
   think again.&nbsp; The subject matter of this film is so slimy, 
   you'll need to towel-off after watching it. Every adult in this film, 
   including the film's part-time detective Calvin (Vic Tayback), who 
   considers Ellie &quot;good breeding stock&quot;, are portrayed as 
   sleazy, conniving individuals who only care about their own 
   satisfactions. When the killings begin, it plays like a mystery film 
   with enough blood and guts to keep you asking yourself, &quot;Is this 
   really rated PG or did someone fuck-up royally?&quot; There's hammer 
   and cleaver violence, attempted rape, catfighting teens in their 
   underwear, partial teen nudity, kids being tortured, implied incest, 
   shots of open wounds bleeding and other politically incorrect doings 
   going on. By the time the killer is unmasked (literally) in the 
   film's finale, you'll be shaking your head in disbelief at some of 
   the things you'll see and hear. This is the closest thing to PG-rated 
   porn that you will ever see. In other words, if you haven't seen 
   this, you should as soon as possible. Be on the lookout for a very

    We see a young man (Fran&ccedil;ois Montagut) sitting in front of a 
   piano, listening to classical music on his Walkman (remember them?) 
   while thinking about a motorcycle accident, where he apparently died. 
   He then goes to a confectionery store and stabs the clerk over and 
   over with a large knife, all the while listening to classical music 
   through his earbuds. He then goes to the home of book editor Tracy 
   (Joanna Pacula; <B><A HREF="kiss_1988.htm">THE KISS</A></B> - 1988), 
   sneaks in (almost getting caught by Tracy's saint bernard, Beau) and 
   leaves something in her refrigerator. We don't see what it is (at 
   this moment), but police detective Michael (Tomas Arana; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Sect1991">THE
    SECT</A></B> - 1991) arrives at the confectionery store and 
   discovers the killer cut off one of the clerk's ears. The next 
   morning, when Tracy goes to the cemetery to visit the grave of her 
   dead husband Abe, the cemetery director (Gianni Giuliano) tells her 
   someone stole her dead husband's body out of his grave. To make 
   matters worse, when Tracy goes home and grabs something to drink out 
   of the refrigerator, she discovers the ear in a plastic bag, her name 
   written on a piece of paper in what turns out to be in her dead 
   husband's handwriting. Michael questions Tracy and discovers a clue 
   under her refrigerator, a piece of cloth from her husband's coffin. 
   Why is the killer obsessed with Tracy and why does classical music 
   turn him in to such a vicious killer?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next time we see the killer, he is in a womens bathroom in a 
   mall. He grabs a woman's right hand from under a stall and cuts it 
   off, the hand falling into a toilet. When Michael and his team arrive 
   at the mall, he discovers the woman's chest was also cut open. He has 
   a couple of officers watch Tracy's home in hopes the &quot;homicidal 
   maniac&quot; will return. Michael pays another visit to Tracy and 
   tells her there has been another murder. He checks her home to make 
   sure it is secure and tells her to lock her windows and doors as he 
   leaves. A short time later, Beau begins whimpering at the front door 
   and Tracy stupidly takes him for a walk outside. She gets the feeling 
   that she is not alone and turns around, finding the severed right 
   hand hanging from her front door. Once again, Michael comes to her 
   house and asks Tracy to tell him about her dead husband. She tells 
   Michael that Abe was well-liked by her family and friends and, oh, he 
   was a concert pianist! Michael then goes to the home of Abe's best 
   friend, Morangi (Giovanni Lombardo Radice; <B><A HREF="#HouseEdgePark1979">THE
    HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK</A></B> - 1979), who tells him that he 
   identified Abe's dead body after his motorcycle accident (Tracy never 
   did see his dead body). He then shows Michael a photo of Abe (with 
   another man). It comes as no surprise that the photo of Abe is also 
   the killer we have been seeing.&nbsp; Morangi lets Michael search 
   Abe's work desk and he finds an address book hidden in one of the 
   drawers. One of the officers protecting Tracy discover a case in her 
   refrigerator that is dripping blood. He calls Michael to tell him 
   what he found, when Abe appears (a stocking pulled over his head) and 
   he throws the officer in Tracy's indoor pool and makes a hasty retreat.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The only name that pans out in the address book is that of a female 
   psychiatrist named Dr. Jennifer Corti (Erika Blanc; <B><A HREF="#NightEvelynGrave71">THE
    NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE</A></B> - 1971). She tells 
   Michael that Tracy was her patient and that she changed her last name 
   when her brother died, She also tells him that she had a patient 
   named Timothy Bell, who was obsessed with Tracy. Dr. Corti knew 
   Timothy could be very violent, so she had him committed to a 
   psychiatric facility for Tracy's well-being and safety. She also 
   tells Michael that she never met Tracy's husband. It doesn't take a 
   genius to figure out that all this has something to do with the 
   killings, but what comes next is truly mind-boggling (and not in a 
   good way!). Michael and Tracy soon have romantic feelings for each 
   other, putting his life in danger. Abe then kills a lifeguard 
   swimming in a pool and cuts off his penis and, yes, mails it to 
   Tracy. Michael intercepts it before Tracy can see the lifeguard's 
   package in the package. The coroner (Guido Quintozzi) tells Michael 
   that he discovered something he didn't notice before: all three 
   victims had some of their internal organs removed, as if the killer 
   were a skilled surgeon. The Police Chief (Gianni Garko; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightOfThe Devils72">NIGHT
    OF THE DEVILS</A></B> - 1972) warns Michael to act professional and 
   not to have feelings for Tracy, but he can't help himself, as he and 
   Tracy make love that night. Michael discovers that Timothy Bell 
   escaped from the loony bin fifteen months ago, but what is his 
   connection to Abe? I have no idea, because this film is all over the 
   place! The coroner tells Michael that all three murder victims 
   received transplanted organs, the same organs the killer removed. The 
   coroner also tells him that all the victims received their 
   transplanted organs from the same donor: Abe. OK, now I'm really 
   confused. Is Abe alive or what?!?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Morangi tells Michael that he just saw Abe and he must have 
   misidentified his body when he &quot;died&quot; in the motorcycle 
   accident. Michael notices that Morangi is drunk and scared, but is he 
   lying? Michael discovers that two other people are still alive with 
   transplanted organs from Abe. Both of them are women. One is a 
   teacher of young children and the other one is pregnant and in the 
   hospital. Can Michael save them in time? Michael also discovers (He 
   does a lot of discovering in this film!) that the photo Morangi 
   showed him of Abe also contains the image of Timothy Bell. That's 
   right, the person we (and Michael) thought was Abe is actually 
   Timothy Bell, who worshiped Abe and is collecting Abe's organs to 
   make him whole again (remember, he stole Abe's body from the 
   cemetery). Or so I thought...</FONT></FONT><BR>

    In a series of coincidences that would even make God blush, we 
   discover the killer is actually Abe (I know, I know!) and he kills 
   the school teacher in front of her young charges (her blood splashes 
   on a young boy sitting in the front row). Since only the pregnant 
   lady is left, can Michael save her and solve this extremely confusing 
   mystery? Let's hope so, because I can't think straight!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While this film has plenty of violence, all I could think about is 
   that the camera pulls away just as it is about to get interesting. We 
   never see the killer remove the organs, or even the ear and the 
   penis. We only see them after the deed is done (As for the penis, we 
   never see it at all, as <A HREF="body_puzzle_1993.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/body puzzle italy poster6 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>the
    camera gets close to showing us the lifeguard without his pecker, 
   but just as the camera moves down his body, it switches to another 
   scene). Since this film is considered a giallo, the mystery is at the 
   forefront, yet it is so confusing and senseless (screenplay by Bruce 
   Martin, his only film credit and it's easy to see why, from a story 
   by Domenico Paolella, director of <B><A HREF="stunt_squad_1977.htm">STUNT
    SQUAD</A></B> - 1977), that I got a migraine headache trying to 
   unravel it. It is obvious that Lamberto Bava saw <B><A HREF="body_parts_1991.htm">BODY
    PARTS</A></B> (1991) before making this film because the plot of 
   this film follows that film very closely, almost to the point of 
   plagiarism. There is also no nudity here (just like the organ 
   removal, when Tracy removes her clothes to make love to Michael, it 
   switches to another scene) to keep our minds off the amazing 
   coincidences that happen, which is a major sin for a giallo film. 
   Director Bava has delivered a polished film which, unfortunately, 
   goes nowhere, especially the super-quick finale which tries to wrap 
   things up, but delivers more questions than answers. Films like this 
   are why giallo flicks went out of fashion. People didn't grow tired 
   of them, they grew tired of all the cliches filling the later films, 
   such as this one. This film doesn't conclude, it just ends.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    BOSTON STRANGLER: THE UNTOLD STORY</A><A NAME="BostonStranglerUnto"></A> 
   (2006) -</B> It's time once again for another one of director/producer/screenwriter
    Michael Feifer's wildly inaccurate accounts of a well-known serial 
   killer. This time it is Albert De Salvo, a.k.a. &quot;The Boston 
   Strangler&quot;, and like most of Feifer's serial killer flicks (see 
   my review of <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BTK2007">B.T.K.</A></B> - 
   2007), this one is more about stunt casting rather than actual facts 
   (although there are a few truths in this film here and there). David 
   Faustino (&quot;Bud Bundy&quot; on TV's <B><A HREF="married_with_children_tv_series_1987-1997.htm">MARRIED
    WITH CHILDREN</A></B> [1987 - 1997]) plays the vertically-challenged 
   Albert (with a piss-poor Boston accent) who, during the 1960's, 
   supposedly strangled and raped thirteen women, sending Boston into a 
   serial killer panic. The film opens in 1973, with an already 
   incarcerated Albert agreeing to tell his life story to a 
   psychiatrist. We then flashback to the early 60's, during the middle 
   of the Boston Strangler panic, as we witness the Strangler killing 
   Jennifer Mitchum (Jen Nikolaisen) in her home. Police detective John 
   Marsden (Andrew Divoff; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Rage2007">THE RAGE</A></B> 
   - 2007) is assigned to the Strangler case, but he is handcuffed by a 
   police captain (Timothy Oman), who keeps supplying the newspapers 
   with vital information that should be kept secret. <A HREF="boston_strangler_the_untold_story_2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/boston strangler the untold story dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="199" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Marsden
    believes that there are two stranglers at work here (he's right), 
   but Mayor Arthur Winfield (Joe Torry, in a wince-inducing 
   performance) doesn't want to hear it and threatens Marsden's job if 
   he makes that fact public (Marsden dreams of a future when forensic 
   evidence, like DNA, will help nab killers, but the police chief 
   shakes his head and says, &quot;Not in my lifetime.&quot;). Albert 
   fools one young woman into believing he works for a modeling agency 
   and talks her into going back to her place so he can take her 
   &quot;measurements&quot;. As soon as he tries to guess her breast cup 
   size (by putting his hands on her tits!), the young woman realizes he 
   is a fake, so Albert rapes and strangles her with a stocking tied in 
   a bow, based on evidence he read in the newspapers. This film 
   purports that the real Boston Strangler was an unknown criminal and 
   that Albert De Salvo was merely a copycat killer, raping and killing 
   because his mail-order Russian bride, Claudia (Tara Shayne), won't 
   have sex with him. In 1964, Mayor Winfield creates a &quot;Strangler 
   Squad&quot; and appoints a clueless paper-pusher to head it, 
   insulting Marsden even more because he has to report to him, which 
   turns his job into nothing but an unfunny and political joke. Albert 
   is arrested and put in a cell with violent criminal Frank Asarian 
   (Kostas Sommer; Feifer's <B><A HREF="drifter_henry_lee_lucas_2009.htm">DRIFTER:
    HENRY LEE LUCAS</A></B> - 2009) and, before long, Frank has scammed 
   Albert into confessing that he's the Boston Strangler to shyster 
   lawyer Stuart Whitmore (Corin Nemec; Feifer's <B><A HREF="chicago_massacre_richard_speck_2007.htm">CHICAGO
    MASSACRE: RICHARD SPECK</A></B> - 2007), who agrees to take the case 
   for a third of the reward money. Marsden doesn't believe it for a 
   second, but the case is a political hot potato and the rest, as they 
   say, is history (at least revisionist history).&nbsp; Triple-threat 
   Michael Feifer, who is also responsible for the serial killer films <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#EdGeinButcherPlainf">ED
    GEIN: THE BUTCHER OF PLAINFIELD</A></B> (2007) and <B><A HREF="#BundyLegacyEvil2008">BUNDY:
    A LEGACY OF EVIL</A></B> (2008), manages to coax pretty good 
   performances out of David Faustino (phony accent not withstanding) 
   and Andrew Divoff (who doesn't even attempt an accent), but the film 
   is so flat and uninvolving, it's hard to get worked-up over the 
   proceedings. The violence level in this film is bloodless, since most 
   of the killings are stranglings and the instant comraderie between 
   Albert and Frank when they meet in their cell seems forced and 
   unreal. The film's implication that Frank may have been the real 
   Boston Strangler may be this film's biggest conceit has to offer (not 
   to mention the HUGE coincidence that Albert is thrown into the same 
   cell with him!), not to mention that the flick also suggests that 
   Albert was killed in prison in 1973 because he was about to expose 
   Frank as the real Strangler. It's not only a jump in logic, it's a 
   giant leap of faith. The film ends with a disclaimer that in 2001, 
   the Strangler's last victim was exhumed for DNA evidence under her 
   fingernails and undergarments (You mean to tell me she was buried in 
   the same panties she was raped in?) and the evidence came up with two 
   different individuals. Neither of those individuals was Albert De 
   Salvo. Read into that what you want, but as far as movies go, rent or 
   buy the DVD of the 1968 film, <B><A HREF="boston_strangler_1968.htm">THE

    A LEGACY OF EVIL</A><A NAME="BundyLegacyEvil2008"></A> (2008) -</B> 
   Another &quot;true-life&quot; serial killer flick from 
   director/producer/screenwriter Michael Feifer, who also gave us other 
   serial killer films such as <B><A HREF="#BostonStranglerUnto">THE 
   BOSTON STRANGLER: THE UNTOLD STORY</A></B> (2006), <B><A HREF="#EdGeinButcherPlainf">ED

   (2007). In this film, which mixes some facts with mostly fiction, Ted 
   Bundy (Corin Nemec; <B><A HREF="mansquito_2005.htm">MANSQUITO</A></B> 
   - 2005) is first seen drunk around a campfire, pulling a tied-up girl 
   out of his Volkswagen Beetle (the real Bundy did drive a Beetle) and 
   telling her in no uncertain terms that she is about to die 
   (&quot;After I kill you, I'm going to burn you. I'm going to burn 
   your head in the fucking fire and I'm gonna watch your pretty face 
   melt and your eyeballs fall out of your fucking head! Look at the 
   sky. I want you to see the stars while you die!&quot;). He then kills 
   the poor girl by pummelling her with a shovel and then challenges God 
   to strike him dead. The next time we see Bundy, he's in a prison cell 
   awaiting execution. The Warden (Kane Hodder; who played both Ed Gein 
   and the B.T.K. killer in Feifer's other films) informs Bundy that his 
   latest appeal has failed and his &quot;luck&quot; has run out. Bundy 
   would rather think of it as &quot;fate&quot;, since he has found 
   religion in prison (don't they all?) and the Warden hands him a tape 
   recorder so he can record all his sins before he does the dead man 
   walking routine. The<A HREF="bundy_a_legacy_of_evil_2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/bundy a legacy of evil dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   film then flashes back to when Bundy was a young boy, reading violent 
   comic books (yeah, they turns us all into killers!), while the adults 
   in his life argue about telling Teddy &quot;the truth&quot; (his 
   sister is actually his mother; a true fact). We then switch to the 
   University of Washington in 1966, where handsome student Bundy woos 
   pretty co-ed Stephanie (Jen Nikolaisen, a regular player in Feifer's 
   films) by quoting Shakespeare and eventually moving in with her (It's 
   really the only stable relationship he's had with anyone in his 
   entire life before it all turns to shit). Bundy has a problem with 
   premature ejaculation when he tries to make love to Stephanie, which 
   causes all kinds of problems in their personal life (She callously 
   says to him: &quot;I can have better sex with a damn retard!&quot; Yee-ouch!).
    Stephanie breaks-off the relationship and Bundy begins his killing 
   spree, leaving school and traveling to Burlington, Vermont, where he 
   was born (another true fact). He goes to the county hall of records, 
   where he finally learns the truth about his sister/mother and the 
   next time we see him, he has just raped an unfortunate hitch-hiker 
   (no premature ejaculation here), tied her up like a dog and then 
   kills her in the basement of a burned-out home in the middle of the 
   desert. Now it's 1971 and Bundy is working at a suicide hotline in 
   Seattle, Washington, where he proves to be a natural (many sociopaths 
   are good at adapting to their surroundings, especially when they can 
   relate to the subject). At the same time, he is luring a series of 
   girls into his red Beetle and then raping and killing them (at one 
   point, we watch as he throws the severed head of one of his victims 
   into a fireplace and he gets-off watching it burn!). It's now 1973 
   and Bundy is working on Washington State's gubernatorial election. 
   Bundy reconnects with Stephanie while on a trip to San Francisco. He 
   proposes marriage to her in a crowded restaurant and she accepts, but 
   when he goes to the mens room, he doesn't return, leaving Stephanie 
   to look like a fool (Maybe she should go fuck a damn retard!). 
   Meanwhile, Bundy continues his cross-country killing spree (we will 
   never know the exact number of his victims), until he is captured by 
   a cop while sleeping in his car. Bundy escapes from a Colorado jail 
   (his first of two jail breaks) and continues his killing spree until 
   he is eventually caught again and sentenced to the electric chair, 
   which we see carried out.&nbsp; As with most of Michael Feifer's 
   serial killer films, there are germs of truth to Bundy's life story, 
   but there is more &quot;artistic license&quot; than fact. Corin Nemec 
   (who also had a role on Feifer's Boston Strangler film and also 
   portrayed Richard Speck in Feifer's <B><A HREF="chicago_massacre_richard_speck_2007.htm">CHICAGO
    MASSACRE: RICHARD SPECK</A></B> - 2007) is quite good as Ted Bundy, 
   who is appropriately charming when he needs to be and then creepy as 
   hell the next moment. While there are a couple of gory killings, most 
   of Bundy's murders are kept off-screen, as director/writer Feifer 
   seems more interested in Bundy's internal demons (he keeps flashing 
   back to when Bundy was a little boy in a cowboy hat). Don't get me 
   wrong, there are some graphic scenes of violence on display, 
   especially during the final third (including Bundy killing two 
   sleeping co-eds with a baseball bat and then breaking into another 
   girl's apartment, where he brutally beats her with his fists and a 
   telephone), but this film is more of a psychological piece, showing 
   how Bundy used his good looks and high intelligence to nearly get 
   away with all his killings, but like all narcissists, his own 
   inflated ego gets the best of him (especially when he acts as his own 
   defense attorney in his trial for killing the two sleeping co-eds). 
   As far as Feifer's serial killer films go, this one rates better than 
   most, so if you are hesitant about which one of Feifer's serial 
   killer films to start out with, try <B><A HREF="bundy_a_legacy_of_evil_2008b.htm">BUNDY:

   bright red hat (making her stand out from the crowd). When she gets

   Kurt (Fulvio Mingozzi; <B><A HREF="#SevenBloodOrchids72">SEVEN BLOOD-STAINED
    ORCHIDS</A></B> - 1972, in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo, but his 
   photo is prominently displayed throughout the film), has left for 
   Tokyo and she really needs to see him, so come over right away. When 
   he comes over they make love (look for a <A HREF="j&amp;b_scotch_whiskey_in_italian_films.htm">bottle
    of J&amp;B Scotch</A> next to the record player, one of many 
   appearances it makes in this film), which is juxtaposed with footage 
   of Kurt's plane in the air, headed for Tokyo. Just as they finish 
   making love, we then see the plane explode, giving a whole new 
   meaning to the word &quot;climax&quot;! A short time later, Lisa (who 
   is sleeping in bed with her lover) gets a phone call telling her that 
   her husband is dead, one of thirty-five people killed when the plane 
   exploded. The question becomes: Did Lisa or her lover have anything 
   to do with the plane exploding or is it something even more sinister? 
   (Martino keeps the viewer off-balance, zooming the camera in tight on 
   Lisa and her lover's eyes and even zooming in on a photo of Kurt that 
   resides on Lisa's nightstand, so we can't decide who the killer 
   actually is, making them all look guilty. It's an often-used giallo 
   trope, but it works here.).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A short time later, an insurance executive named Mr. Brenton (cameo 
   king Tom Felleghy; <B><A HREF="#Eyeball1975">EYEBALL</A></B> - 1975) 
   contacts Lisa and tells her to come to his office. When she arrives, 
   he tells Lisa that her husband took a life insurance policy on 
   himself while he was in Greece, naming her as the beneficiary. Lisa 
   tells Mr. Brenton she had no idea her husband took out the policy, 
   explaining that she and Kurt led independent lives. His business was 
   located in Greece, where he spent most of his time and every once in 
   a while he would come to London, staying no longer than a couple of 
   days (Where can I get a marriage like that!?!), Mr. Brenton then 
   tells Lisa that the policy was for one million pounds, payable to 
   her, but only after the &quot;necessary formalities&quot; are 
   completed. When Lisa walks out of the room, Mr. Brenton tells his 
   secretary to contact &quot;Peter Lynch&quot;, he needs to talk to 
   him. I wonder if Peter Lynch is part of those necessary formalities?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Lisa leaves Mr. Brenton's office, it is obvious she is being 
   followed by a man with blond hair. He follows her taxi and watches 
   her exit the cab and go into a phone booth, where she calls her lover 
   and tells him everything went smoothly, she will travel to Greece to 
   cash-in the life insurance policy and then they can be together all 
   of the time, revealing to the viewer that she knew about the policy 
   well before Mr. Brenton told her, but did she have anything to do 
   with her husband's death (making her a mass murderess)? When Lisa 
   exits the phone booth, she notices that the blond-haired man is 
   following her. It turns out he is an ex-lover of Lisa's named Philip 
   (actor unknown, but familiar), who tells her he has a certain letter 
   she wrote that will implicate her in her husband's murder.&nbsp; It 
   turns out Lisa left Philip because he became a hopeless drug addict, 
   so she asks him how much he wants for the letter (he knows about the 
   insurance policy). He tells her it is going to cost her a large sum 
   of money, because his drug habit has become bad. He needs five hits a 
   day and that is an expensive habit. Lisa agrees to pay him and gives 
   him a hundred pounds to start him off, promising to give him more 
   money later that night, neither of them noticing that another man in 
   sunglasses is watching them. A short time later, Lisa sneaks into 
   Philip's apartment to look for the letter, but she finds the place 
   ransacked, the letter missing. She then notices Philip stabbed in the 
   stomach, his dying words are Lisa's name (Just before Lisa entered 
   the apartment, we see a man in a hat and a trenchcoat walking away, 
   putting a letter in his coat pocket. Could it be the letter Lisa is 
   looking for? Count on it!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Lisa then flies to Greece and checks into a hotel, a strange 
   handsome man following her (Lisa seems to attract strangers!). When 
   the man approaches Lisa at the dinner table, she tells him she knows 
   who he is. He's Peter Lynch (George Hilton; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CaseOfTheBloodyIris">THE
    CASE OF THE BLOODY IRIS</A></B> - 1971) and Lisa knows he is an 
   insurance investigator for the company that her husband insured his 
   life with, telling Peter that she, too, has informants. Peter is not 
   surprised, telling her that nothing is really private these days (He 
   should see what it's like today!) and admits defeat. Lisa tells him 
   to quit wasting his time, confessing that she cheated on her husband 
   and then excuses herself, saying that she must leave, she has another 
   appointment. She gets up from the table and walks away, but we see 
   another man, John Stanley (Alberto De Mendoza; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#LizardWomansSkin">A

    We then see Liza take a taxi to her next appointment and goes to an 
   empty theater, where she meets Lara Florakis (the late <A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_3.htm#JanineReynaud">Janine
    Reynaud</A>; <B><A HREF="blindman_1971.htm">BLINDMAN</A></B> - 1971) 
   and her lawyer Sharif (Luis Barboo; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LoreleysGrasp1973">THE
    LORELEY'S GRASP</A></B> - 1973), the man in the sunglasses who was 
   watching Lisa in London and who may be responsible for Philip's 
   murder. Lara accuses Lisa of killing Kurt, telling her that her 
   husband was going to divorce Lisa and marry her. Kurt was going to 
   change the life insurance policy and name Lara as the beneficiary, 
   accusing Lisa of finding that out and killing Kurt before he could 
   make the changes. Lara says the million pounds belong to her, but 
   Lisa tells her that no court in the world would recognize that Lara 
   had any right to that money (she has a point). Lara tells her 
   (actually, she threatens her) that Sharif is not much of a lawyer, 
   but he has a special talent for making people disappear without a 
   trace (Sharif doesn't say a word, he just stands there looking 
   extremely dangerous). Lara once again accuses Lisa of killing Kurt 
   and tells her she is going to pay for what she lost. Lisa says she 
   didn't kill anyone, so Lara says she can tell that to the inquest 
   commission who are investigating the plane crash. If Lara reports her 
   to the commission, the insurance company will block payment of the 
   million pounds. She then tries to make a deal with Lisa. If she were 
   to sign a document giving Lara half the money, Lisa could count on 
   her showing her &quot;gratitude&quot;, otherwise she will get revenge 
   on Lisa for killing Kurt. Sharif slowly approaches Lisa, so she runs 
   away, Lara telling Sharif to stop her. As Sharif and Lara chase Lisa 
   down a long metal spiral staircase (there are two spiral staircases 
   in this film), Peter is waiting at the bottom, saving Lisa from 
   certain harm.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next morning, Lisa goes to the bank to cash her million pound 
   check, the bank manager telling Lisa that it would be safer to 
   transfer the money to her London bank, but Lisa says no, she wants it 
   in cash, so they give it to her in a black leather case (it looks 
   like a woman's makeup case), She then goes to a travel agency and 
   books a first class plane ticket to Tokyo, which leaves at 9:00p.m. 
   that night. Why in the world does she want to go to Toyko? Think you 
   know? You may be right in your assumption, but there are many more 
   surprises to be had in this twisty mystery, which is like a 
   crossbreed of giallo and Eurocrime genres. What I have described in 
   this review happens in the first thirty minutes of the film and if I 
   tell you any more, it would deprive you of discovering why Sergio 
   Martino is a master of the giallo genre. The screenplay was also 
   written by three masters of the giallo genre, namely Ernesto Gastaldi (<B><A HREF="#DeathWalksHeels1971">DEATH
    WALKS ON HIGH HEELS</A></B> - 1971), Eduardo M. Brochero (<B><A HREF="#HumanCobras1971">HUMAN

    AND DEATH IN THE GARDEN OF THE GODS</A></B> - 1972), who supply a 
   very intriguing mystery as well as offering a nice dose of police 
   work, courtesy of Inspector Stavros (Luigi Pistilli; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#KillersGuests1974">THE
    KILLERS ARE OUR GUESTS</A></B> - 1974), an Athens Police detective 
   who becomes involved in the case when people end up murdered. One 
   memorable gag shows an unfinished jigsaw puzzle on Inspector Stavros' 
   office desk. We see the puzzle being slowly pieced together to 
   completion the closer he gets to solving the murders (Pay close 
   attention to who completes the puzzle). I can't tell you who ends up 
   dead because I need to leave you, my dear readers,<A HREF="case_of_the_scorpions_tail_1971_foreign_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/case of the scorpion's tail italy poster18a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   with something to discover on your own. Needless to say, the people 
   killed in this film are important to cracking the case, so if you 
   want to know if Lisa murdered Kurt (or if there is some other 
   explanation), you are just going to have to watch the film. I can 
   promise you one thing: If you are a giallo fan (and who isn't?), I 
   can guarantee you will not be disappointed. There is violence (some 
   of it quite graphic for its time), female nudity, especially by the 
   lovely Evelyn Stewart and Anita Strindberg (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WhoSawHerDie">WHO
    SAW HER DIE?</A></B> - 1972), who portrays female reporter Cleo 
   Dupont, a character I haven't mentioned in this review, who teams up 
   with Peter to try and solve the case (and becoming his lover), as 
   well as some unusual camera angles (check out the scene where 
   Inspector Stavros asks to check Peter's hands) and unusual locations 
   (including the Parthenon and an underwater cavern). I can't tell you 
   much about Cleo without giving away the core of the story, but I will 
   tell you this: She is important to getting to the bottom of the 
   murders, but, please, don't make me tell you any more. Believe me 
   when I say I want to, but I can't in good conscience (Okay, just one 
   slight hint: The killer wears a wetsuit.). So what does a scorpion 
   have to do with anything, since it is mentioned in the title? It 
   seems the killer lost a cufflink during one of his murder attempts 
   and it is, yes, a scorpion cufflink. Tracking down the Turkish 
   jeweler who made it leads to the killer's identity (Now I've said too much!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

   vast fortune and estate. She runs into problems with Behrouz (he 
   can't stand her) and his cat, Samson, who attacks her at every 
   available moment. The first problem with this film is the cat. Samson 
   is as about as vicious as a toothless frog (having two cats myself, I 
   know what I'm talking about). The film's idea of showing his 
   viciousness is by dangling a piece of string in front of him and 
   photographing him swatting at it. In one flub, the cat is shown 
   rubbing against Danning, showing her affection. Another detraction is 
   the presence of Wossoughi (who is given an English name &quot;Tony 
   Bova&quot; in the end credits), a Pakistani (?) actor (?) who looks 
   out of place among the other players. He looks as much like De Kova's 
   son as Eddie Murphy would look like David Duke's. It looks like 
   someone owed somebody a big favor. Even though Colleen Camp (<B><A HREF="death_game_1977.htm">DEATH

   Wossoughi's girlfriend (she's a great actress) and sing the title

    Andrew Prine disposes of various naked centerfold girls with his

   her to drink alcohol and nearly rape her. She escapes and runs to the 
   camp where owner Aldo Ray saves her. Ray then attempts to rape her,

   diverse people are drugged and helicoptered to a top secret 
   underground government base, where a female government official with 
   the name of Mary Louise Borden (Kelly Lange) pops-up on a giant 
   computer screen to inform them that a global nuclear war has broken 
   out and they were picked to &quot;continue the human race&quot;. Ms. 
   Borden also informs them that there are twelve other installations 
   just like theirs scattered throughout the United States and that they 
   have enough food and provisions to live underground for the next five 
   years. Ms. Borden also tells them that when radiation levels on the 
   surface reach the point that allows human life again, the elevator 
   doors will open and let them return above ground. Major Gordon Ellis 
   (Richard Jaeckel) then appears in person and shows them satellite 
   footage of a nuclear-ravaged Earth. We are then introduced to all the 
   characters and their idiosyncracies: Ray Couzins (Jackie Cooper), a 
   corporation genius who doesn't buy into the nuclear war scenario and 
   is looking for a way out; Peter Macomber (Bradford Dillman), a 
   psychologist who studies the group and makes observations into a tape 
   recorder; Kristen Lerner (Christina Moreno), a nutritionist who 
   doesn't want to live; Alana Fitzgerald (Diana Muldaur), a 
   Congresswoman; Woody Russo (Lincoln Kilpatrick), an Olympic gold 
   medal win<A HREF="chosen_survivors_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/chosen survivors poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ner;
    Steven Mayes (Alex Cord), a novelist; Luis Cabral (Pedro Armendariz 
   Jr.), an oceanographer; Carrie Draper (Gwenn Mitchell), an ecology 
   expert; Dr. Lenore Chrisman (Barbara Babcock), a Nobel Prize-winning 
   medical researcher; and Claire Farraday (Nancy Rodman), a biologist. 
   Before this group has a chance to worry about the predicament that 
   they are in, they are attacked by a hungry swarm of rabid vampire 
   bats. That's right, vampire bats. The bats have disrupted the 
   lighting system (they only attack in the dark), so Major Ellis sets 
   up an alarm system to warn them when the lights go out (the first 
   attack happens when everyone is sleeping). Ray starts getting drunk 
   and begins telling everyone how he feels (He tells Woody, &quot;You're
    nothing but a goddamn stud!&quot;), thinks this is all a conspiracy 
   (he just may be right) and tries to rape Dr. Chrisman (turns out she 
   likes it!). When Luis is killed by the bats, one of the members 
   reveals that this was all an experiment (not much of a surprise), but 
   when he tries to contact his superiors, he finds the bats have 
   destroyed the rescue signal. He also makes it known that the 
   government planned to kill them once the experiment was over. They 
   have five more days of avoiding the bats (there's a failsafe 
   involved) before troops come down to the base. Will anyone make it 
   out alive?&nbsp; This study in paranoia and isolation went virtually 
   unseen after it's 1974 theatrical release (It did play on Canada's 
   Scream channel, but how many people actually have that channel?) 
   until it was released on DVD in 2007 as part of 20th Century Fox's <B>Midnight
    Movies</B> series. This is a rare bad guy role for Jackie Cooper and 
   he's pretty good here, boozing it up and spouting vitriolic dialogue. 
   He goes around pitting people against each other, bribing some with 
   money and blackmailing others and does it with glee, making his 
   character just as dangerous (if not moreso) as the bats. Even though 
   he's the bad guy, it's his actions which gets everyone saved (even if 
   they were strictly self-serving). The rest of the cast are pretty 
   dreary (to be fair, their roles are underwritten) and take backstage 
   to the bat attacks, which are filmed with a blue filter, probably to 
   hide the more bloody attacks (since this is rated PG). The novel 
   approach with how the group handle the bats (everyone gives a pint of 
   blood, which they smear on a homemade electrified fence) is very well 
   done, even if it doesn't work. I also liked how the daily 
   pre-programmed videotaped announcements by Ms. Borden still played 
   every morning, even after the ruse was exposed. Ms. Borden would tell 
   them in different ways every day how important they were and how they 
   should get on with repopulating humanity, making everything after the 
   expose quite sarcastic. The film reminded me of <B><A HREF="andromeda_strain_1971.htm">THE

   slashed) by someone wearing a rubber witch mask. Nick's manager 
   Webster Jones (David Doyle) sets him up in an old mansion in England 
   to settle down and write and record some new songs. Pretty soon he 
   begins hearing the cries and screams of a woman at night and views a 
   rotting body in a wheelchair and then the maggot-filled head of his 
   ex-wife (who he doesn't know is dead) in a hatbox in the

   years) and the outcome bloody and inconclusive (as the final

   singer than actor, but he begins to get into a groove here that makes 
   the proceedings seem more realistic than if a professional actor were 
   to have taken the role. There are exactly three murders here and they

    The film opens with a new tenant in a house in a small Chinese town. 
   The nosey female neighbor spies on a gentleman wearing a large black 
   hat, sunglasses and a white hankerchief around his face, as he 
   carries a very sickly woman into their new home. The neighbor even 
   goes as far as to listen to her new neighbors making love every 
   night, as she can hear the man moan loudly. She gossips about him her 
   two biddy female friends and when one of them complains about a fetid 
   odor permeating the area of the house, they knock on the new 
   neighbor's door, but the door is padlocked and no one answers. A 
   policeman breaks into the house and the smell is so bad, everyone 
   nearly pukes their guts out. They discover the naked body of a woman, 
   dead for several weeks and covered (and I mean covered) in maggots 
   and worms. The Chief of Police, Inspector Chang (Wang Jung; <B><A HREF="hex_1980c.htm">HEX</A></B> 
   - 1980), is called in to investigate and when the coroner tells him 
   that the dead woman's body was sexually violated after she died, it 
   reminds Chang of a similar case a year ago in a nearby province. 
   Chang and his assistant, Deputy Liu Chun-Te (Tai Chun-Te; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#CentipedeHorror">CENTIPEDE
    HORROR</A></B> - 1987), travel to that province, where Chief 
   Inspector Wu (Tso Tat-Wah; <B><A HREF="action.htm#MadMission">MAD MISSION</A></B> 
   - 1981) tells Inspector Chang and Deputy Liu about the case of 
   necrophilia that happened a little over a year ago (told in an 
   extended flashback). We are in a busy brothel run by the 
   chain-smoking Madame Lan (Tien Ni, a.k.a. &quot;Tanny&quot;; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackMagic2">BLACK
    MAGIC 2</A></B> - 1976) and&nbsp; a man in wearing dark sunglasses 
   in the middle of the night, Li Cheng-Wen (Lin Wei-Tu; <B><A HREF="mighty_peking_man_1977.htm">THE
    MIGHTY PEKING MAN</A></B> - 1977), wants to buy the freedom of

   $500 and he accepts.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then are introduced to a bicycle-riding liquor delivery man, as 
   he delivers a shipment of booze to the brothel. On his ride back, a 
   tire of his bicycle blows and he notices a hole in a wall leading to 
   Li Cheng-Wen's house. He sneaks inside the house and watches as Li 
   Cheng-Wen rubs a white powder (quicklime?) on a naked and dead Li 
   Hung-Mei's body. The next time the liquor delivery man passes by the 
   house, he notices the the hole in the wall is patched up, so he finds 
   another way to get into the house. He then spots Li Cheng-Wen making 
   love to the maggot and worm-ridden body of Li Hung-Mei (a scene which 
   will give your gag reflexes a workout). He calls the police and they 
   arrest Li Cheng-Wen, where he is charged for sexually violating a 
   female corpse and is sentenced to two years in the loony bin. Back in 
   the present, Inspector Chang calls the psychiatric institution where 
   Li Cheng-Wen is prisoner, looking to talk to him and get some 
   information on how a necrophiliac operates, only he learns that Li 
   Cheng-Wen was discharged a month ago. Inspector Chang now has a 
   suspect in the crime committed in his town: Li Cheng-Wen. But when 
   many of the prostitutes in Madame Lan's employ begin to be killed by 
   a man dressed in a black hat, sunglasses and a white handkerchief 
   over his face, Inspector Chang and Deputy Liu stay in the province 
   and try to capture Li Cheng-Wen before he murders again. The 
   Inspector learns from Li Cheng-Wen's brother that he sold some 
   valuable family antiques for twenty thousand dollars, which he 
   intended to use to pay Madame Lan for the freedom of all her 
   prostitutes, but it looks like he decided to kill them instead. 
   Still, Madame Lan is hiding a secret of her own, such as paying a man 
   named Bearded Nine (Gam Biu, a.k.a. &quot;Piao Chin&quot;; <B><A HREF="cleopatra_jones_casino_of_gold_1975.htm">CLEOPATRA
    JONES AND THE CASINO OF GOLD</A></B> - 1975) two thousand dollars. 
   Bearded Nine begins blackmailing Madame Lan and the killer slices him 
   to pieces in his own car (another very bloody and well-shot sequence).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Inspector Chang believes the killer will strike Madame Lan next, so 
   he comes up with a plan to capture the killer in the brothel (There's 
   a giant fakeout scene when someone dressed like Li Cheng-Wen enters 
   Madame Lan's bedroom and tries to attack her, only for her to ring 
   the alarm and have the police surround the &quot;killer&quot;. It 
   turns out to be a dry run by Inspector Chang to see if his plan will 
   work). We then watch as the killer murders Madame Lan's adopted 
   daughter Yen-Erh (Yu Tsui-Ling) as she is walking back to the brothel 
   (the killer even murders a man who tries to stop the attack, by 
   holding the man's head underwater and slicing his throat with the 
   large knife until the water turns bright red). At the busy brothel, 
   it's business as usual, only the police are everywhere inside the 
   house, waiting for Madame Lan to ring the alarm. Unfortunately, the 
   killer is hiding under Madame Lan's bed, so he grabs the Madame by 
   her feet and pulls her to the floor, unable to ring the alarm. 
   Inspector Chang hears Madame Lan's screams, so they go to run 
   upstairs, only to witness a woman's body falling to the floor from 
   the landing above. Everyone thinks it is Madame Lan's body, but the 
   bloody body has its face cut off (another gory and gooey sight). 
   After unsuccessfully chasing the killer and losing him. Inspector 
   Chang inspects the dead woman's fingers and comes to the conclusion 
   that the body isn't Madame Lan's (He doesn't tell anyone that, but 
   notices that there are no nicotine stains on the dead woman's fingers 
   and Madame Lan was a chain-smoker). That night, we see Madame Lan 
   exiting from a secret room in the brothel and going to a hidden box 
   containing twenty thousand dollars. The killer then appears just as 
   Inspector Chang and Deputy Liu enter the brothel. The killer cuts off 
   Madame Lan's head with his trusty knife (!) and it rolls down the 
   stairs. The Inspector and the Deputy then unmask the killer and 
   discover it's not Li Cheng-Wen at all, it's (<I>Name redacted due to 
   it being a major spoiler!</I>). It seems that&nbsp; the killer 
   murdered Li Cheng-Wen a long <A HREF="corpse_mania_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("202","305") --><IMG SRC="images/corpse mania poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>time
    ago and took over his identity, thanks to Madame Lan stealing his 
   twenty thousand dollars, as she had no intent to free any of her 
   prostitutes, so he had the killer murder him. The killer murdered 
   Madame Lin because he realized she was greedy and not going to share 
   the loot with him. The killer leads the Inspector to where he buried 
   Li Cheng-Wen's body and the film ends with the killer being shot by a 
   firing squad for his henious crimes (the sergeant of the firing squad 
   then puts a bullet in his head to make sure he is dead!), as 
   Inspector Chang and Deputy Liu watch in the pouring rain.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This is a damn fine Shaw Brothers production (Produced by the late <A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_2.htm#MonaFong">Mona

   painting, especially the inside of Li Cheng-Wen's house, which 
   couldn't have been possibly been done with sets, as it is way too 
   large to be one, as the sweeping photography reveals. The screenplay,

   Italian Giallo films, as we get many of the killer's POV shots, 
   bloody deaths, constant nudity and all of the other ingredients we 
   associate with that genre, only done with an Asian sensibility. It 
   rivals the best Italian ones, especially when it comes to shocking 
   scenes of violence and trying to guess the mysterious identity of the 
   killer, as we know it couldn't possibly be Li Cheng-Wen, as that 
   would be too easy. If you want to see how other countries treat this 
   genre, you should start with Hong Kong because they know what makes 
   the genre work.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    the boat to crash while traveling at a high rate of speed and 
   putting Marco in the hospital with serious head trauma. The doctor 
   explains to Marco's wife, Monica (Elga Andersen) and his brother, 
   Burt (Ivan Rassimov; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Spasmo">SPASMO</A></B> 
   - 1974), that the only way to save Marco's life is with a risky brain 
   operation. Monica tells the doctor to perform the operation and Marco 
   survives, only he has lost his memory. Marco returns home (he insists 
   that he drives home, even though he has a chauffeur, something he 
   never did pre-memory loss) and is surrounded by people that are his 
   friends, although he doesn't remember any of them (he does have quick 
   flashes of the boating &quot;accident&quot;). At a dinner party at 
   his home, Marco receives a phonecall by someone claiming to be Sante, 
   Marco's former gardener. He tells Marco that he &quot;must 
   remember&quot; and to meet him at the cemetery alone at midnight, 
   which seems to visibly upset both Monica and Burt. That night, while 
   Marco waits at the cemetery, someone wearing black gloves strangles 
   Sante and then runs over him with a car. Police Inspector Baldini 
   (Julio Pena), who is already investigating Marco's boating mishap (he 
   hints that he thinks it was sabotage), arrives at the villa to inform 
   everyone that Sante is dead and he believes the last phonecall made 
   to him came from a phone booth located just outside the villa gates. 
   Both Monica and friend (and fellow boat pilot) Tommy Brown (Franco 
   Ressel; <B><A HREF="#EyeInTheLabyrinth">EYE IN THE LABRYINTH</A></B> 
   - 1972) let Marco believe that they saw him sneak out of the villa 
   the night before, but Marco denies it. That night, someone stabs 
   Tommy at the boatyard, killing him. As the plot becomes much too 
   complicated to describe here, Marco begins to get his memory back 
   little pieces at a time. As he tries to fit the puzzle pieces of his 
   life back together, a few questions rise to the forefront: Why won't 
   Monica make love to Marco? Just what was Terry's (Rosanna Yanni; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hunchback Morgue">HUNCHBACK

    his accident? Is it possible that Marco is actually the killer or is 
   someone setting him up? When Marco seemingly kills himself trying to 
   get away from the police in a car chase, the antagonists turn on and 
   then kill each other until only one is left. If you haven't already 
   guessed, there's a surprise ending that explains everything.&nbsp; 
   This fairly standard giallo film, directed by Tonino Ricci (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Panic 1976">PANIC</A></B> 
   - 1982; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Raiders Magic Ivory">RAIDERS OF THE 
   MAGIC IVORY</A></B> - 1988), is pretty rough going for seasoned 
   giallo fans, but casual viewers will probably be more entertained. 
   The fact that it took five people (including Ricci) to write this 
   film's screenplay, a routine &quot;lets frame the brother/husband for 
   murder since our attempt on his life failed and another attempt to 
   murder him would throw up too many red flags&quot;, makes the viewer 
   wish there were more meat to the plot. Setting the film in the realm 
   of cigarette boat culture (where the speedboats spend more time in 
   the air than the water as they zip across the surface of the ocean) 
   is a unique idea, but it's unfortunately underused. Toss in a severe 
   lack of nudity (only one scene) and bloody violence and all the 
   viewer has to occupy their time is the mystery itself and it's not a 
   hard mystery to solve. The use of amnesia as a major plot element is 
   nothing new, especially in mystery films, and it's woefully 
   mishandled here. As with most 70's giallo films, there's a scene at a 
   disco (miniskirt alert), POV shots by the killer (always wearing 
   black gloves, of course) and a short car chase. I really can't 
   recommend this film (just because it's rare doesn't mean it's good) 
   unless you're a gialli completist or newbie. The only true highlight 
   is Giorgio Gaslini's infectious music score, including the unusual 
   opening tune, which has a hook that will take days to leave your 
   head. Future director Flavio Mogherini (<B><A HREF="#PyjamaGirlCase">THE

   a year before. A woman&nbsp; was chopped to pieces with an axe and 
   her head was never found. As soon as the wife steps through the door 
   she begins to have visions of the murder much to the disapproval of 
   her husband. She had a nervous breakdown due to alcoholism years 
   before and her husband does not want it to happen again. This 
   self-serving bastard cares more about making a good impression with 
   his boss than with the welfare of his wife. She meets some strange 
   people in her neighborhood: Her next door neighbor, a woman with a 
   cheating husband, introduces herself with some sexually frank talk. 
   Her gardener, a balding weirdo, loves to get media attention.. An 
   ex-cop (Aldo Ray) has the same visions she does. He believes the 
   wrong man was convicted of the murder and the killer is still at 
   large. He was right. It turns out that their visions are not of the 
   past murder but of a future murder. Choppy editing, canned music, 
   vaseline lenses, flubbed lines and bad acting actually add to the 
   ambience of this rarely seen film. This one was made during the nadir 
   of' the late Aldo Ray's career and he lends an air of professionalism 
   to an otherwise amateur affair. While most of you will probably think 
   I'm nuts for recommending this one, it did keep my attention. That's

   watching 85 minutes of his film without getting a payoff. The action 
   is bloodless, the suspense lacking and the nudity is non-existant

   It's not long before everyone becomes hungry and people begin

   directly involved in giving an old man (Tim Whelan) a heart attack, 
   killing him. The old man's son, Charles Ennis (David Brown) vows 
   revenge. Ennis goes to black marketeer Mort Logan and makes a deal 
   with him. Ennis knows that Grant's daughter Susan (a young Kim 
   Cattrell) is getting married tomorrow (where all the neighbors plan 
   to show up with gifts of food) and he will give Logan all the details 
   for a percentage of the food. Logan and his goons invade the wedding, 
   steal the food and kill Grant's wife Leah (Dawn Greenhalgh) and 
   Susan's new husband John (Jim Henshaw), when Wilcox and Michael get 
   into a shootout with them. The normally peaceable Grant shifts into 
   revenge mode and heads to the big city to get some justice. Grant 
   first stops at Ennis' house, where he learns of Michael's involvement 
   in the death of Ennis' father and that Logan is on his way back to 
   Grant's farm for some payback (A guilt-ridden Ennis poisons his 
   family's last meal, killing them all [off screen]). Grant races back 
   to his farm, where Michael is holding off Logan's men with a rifle. 
   Grant arrives and has a final showdown with Logan, crushing him in 
   his car with a bulldozer. I just love a happy ending.&nbsp; This 
   minor Canadian-made thriller is too preachy for it's own good. While 
   director Timothy Bond (<B><A HREF="shadow_men_1998.htm">THE SHADOW MEN</A></B> 
   - 1997, and too many Canadian TV series to mention) does a good job 
   portraying a society that would do nearly anything to get their hands 
   on their next meal, he pulls back when it comes to showing the 
   violence. The bleak Canadian landscapes (substituting for the Midwest 
   U.S.) greatly enhance the proceedings (global warming has made it 
   snow in August), but the total lack of action, even during the 
   wedding raid and the final assault on Grant's farm (which consists of 
   a couple of bullet hits and a lame-ass car chase) makes it a long, 
   boring ride for most viewers. Clint Walker (<B><A HREF="killdozer_1974.htm">KILLDOZER</A></B> 
   - 1974), who normally makes for a stiff hero, is positively wooden 
   here and is not given very much to do but act as the voice of reason.

   it with a stiff upper lip. The Al Gore documentary on global warming, <B><A HREF="inconvenient_truth_2006.htm">AN

   director Donald Farmer's no-budget madness, a revenge thriller in 
   need of a better editor (at 106 minutes, it's at least 30 minutes too 
   long). Auto body shop owner Art Gary (producer &amp; co-scripter 
   Phillip Newman) is driving his wife and young daughter Sally to 
   church one lazy Sunday morning when they are run off the road by some 
   punk and his two never-do-well female companions, who have just

   clerk (played by Robert Z'Dar; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EvilAltar">EVIL

   staged car wrecks in recent memory), killing his wife, putting Sally 
   in a coma and giving Art a permanent limp (Art nearly dies, but his 
   wife comes to him as an angel and convinces him to return to life for 
   the sake of their daughter!). Two years pass and Art still runs his 
   auto body business and the still-comatose Sally lives with him at 
   their house next to the business, yet there is something drastically 
   different about Art. He's still a religious man, but there is 
   vengeance in his heart, which may be why he is now having severe heart<A HREF="deadly_memories_2002.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/deadly memories dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="188" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   problems that can only be controlled by medication. A surprise visit 
   by the robbed convenience store clerk (who now sports a large facial 
   scar from the attack two years earlier) gives Art the chance to get 
   revenge on Hailey (Tina Krause), one of the female teens involved in 
   the fatal crash. Her car is disabled on the side of the road, so Art 
   tows it and offers Hailey a warm bed to sleep in until her car part 
   arrives the next morning. That night, Hailey is stripped naked, bound 
   and gagged, brought to the car painting shed in Art's garage and 
   spray painted a nice shade of blue by someone wearing a welder's 
   mask. The question soon becomes: Is Art the murderer or is it someone 
   else? Could it be the convenience store clerk? How about Billy Ray 
   (L.P. Brown III), an old friend of Art who has just returned to town 
   after a mysterious two-year absence? Could it be Sheriff Taggart 
   (William Smith; <B><A HREF="action.htm#MerchantOfEvil">MERCHANT OF EVIL</A></B> 
   - 1991), who has a lot of respect for Art? Or is it someone else? 
   When a snooty female representative from the Department of Human 
   Services threatens to take Sally away from Art and put her in a 
   state-run hospital unless she sees progress in her condition within 
   thirty days, Art goes to a bar with Billy Ray to blow off some steam. 
   In the bar is the punk who ran him off the road and Art nearly chokes 
   him to death on a pool table, but Billy Ray intervenes. Later that 
   day, someone blows up the punk and his girlfriend in their car with a 
   rocket launcher, the same rocket launcher that Art keeps in his home 
   (What the hell would a church-fearing man be doing with a rocket 
   launcher? Oh, never mind!). After an obnoxious customer and the 
   female DHS representative are brutally murdered, the identity of the 
   killer is revealed. The finale is a mish-mash of useless 
   sentimentality (Sally wakes up from her coma at the same moment the 
   killer is dispatched) and &quot;What The Fuck?!?&quot; moments (How 
   does someone survive a point-blank shotgun blast to the chest?).&nbsp;
    Though not as gory as most of his other films, director/co-scripter

   - 1990; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#ChainsawCheerleader">CHAINSAW CHEERLEADERS</A></B> 
   - 2008) keeps many of his other trademarks in abundant supply: 
   Questionable acting (Big Bill Smith and Robert Z'Dar excepted); 
   painfully long takes that tax the viewer's patience; cut-rate special 
   effects (done here by Brett Piper, director of such films as <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Psyclops">PSYCLOPS</A></B> 
   [2002] and <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Bacterium2007">BACTERIUM</A></B> 
   [2007], who is also this film's cinematographer); and, of course, 
   copious amounts of female nudity (At one point in the film, a topless 
   female is seen jumping up and down on a trampoline in the middle of a 
   rock quarry. What the hell is a trampoline doing in the middle of a 
   rock quarry?). Phillip Newman, who looks like Conway Twitty's brother 
   (the soundtrack is also full of third-rate Country music tunes), does 
   a halfway decent job in his role as Art, but the character is 
   woefully underwritten, making Art a hard person to root for even 
   though it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out he's not the 
   killer. And therein lies this film's major problem: While the film is 
   dialogue-heavy, most of it is useless to the audience, as it does 
   nothing to advance the plot. Besides a bloody 
   drillbit-through-the-forehead gag and lots of nudity, <B>DEADLY MEMORIES</B> 
   (originally shot under the title <B>BODY SHOP</B>) is a deadly long 
   and boring revenge thriller. Filmed in Tennessee, where, apparently, 
   acting is cheap. Also starring Rachael Robbins, Colby Newman, Sabrina

   young Luddy Dublin makes a living drawing portraits in chalk for 
   $1.50 each. It's apparent from the opening moments that Luddy has a 
   screw loose, as she primps in front of a mirror, complains about the 
   heat, talks to her mother (who never answers back) and pines for her 
   lover Don (his photo is in a frame with cracked glass), who she says

   the front of her slip (exposing a pregnant belly!) is covered in 
   blood. And her Mother? Well, she is dead and leaning up against the

   broad (yet, she still talks to her dead father for advice) and, 
   together with family lawyer Roy Jurroe (Will Geer; <B><A HREF="mafu_cage_1978.htm">THE

   - 1974). Luddy, who is prone to blackouts (especially whenever she 
   sees an axe), finds an ally in Alonzo, who is a doctor with a bad 
   drug habit (besides Alonzo being a junkie, they do have a lot in 
   common, like their love of children) and they become fast friends. 
   Ellen, who is Delilah's nurse, knows all about Luddy's history and 
   hires her to be a housekeeper anyway (Ellen tells Luddy that she'll 
   keep Luddy's murderous history a secret. Now why would she do that?). 
   Richard is having an affair with Grace and they are plotting to 
   murder Delilah. Luddy and Delilah also become fast friends and she 
   tells Luddy that as long as she is here, she's part of the family 
   (While Delilah is saying this, Luddy is getting mighty queasy 
   watching two men chop wood with axes). When Morgan arrives on the 
   estate with his ditsy girlfriend Buffy (Ruth Baker), Delilah 
   announces over dinner that she has sixty days to live and she has 
   willed the estate to the State of Tennessee. She leaves her brothers 
   and sister the paltry sum of $5,000 each, but tells them that 
   somewhere on the estate, their dead Papa has hidden $600,000 and 
   whoever finds it can keep it. Let the killings begin!&nbsp; As a tale 
   of gothic revenge, <B><A HREF="dear_dead_delilah_1972c.htm">DEAR DEAD DELILAH</A></B> 
   works in the same vein as <B><A HREF="whatever_happened_to_baby_jane_1962.htm">WHATEVER

    SWEET CHARLOTTE</A></B> (1964; also featuring Moorehead), as 
   director/screenwriter John Farris places the majority of the action 
   on a Southern plantation with plenty of unlikable characters. It's 
   obvious someone is setting up Luddy to take the fall for all the 
   murders, but which family member is it? As the film progresses and 
   more members end up dead (Roy has his hand chopped-off and dies in 
   front of Luddy and Alonzo while grasping his severed hand in his 
   other hand; Morgan and Buffy meet the sharp end of an axe when they 
   are digging for the treasure at night; Delilah is &quot;killed&quot; 
   [offscreen] by someone pretending to be Papa; a drunk Grace is 
   beheaded by someone on horseback while she is taking a ride in 
   Delilah's wheelchair [the film's standout gore scene]; Alonzo is 
   given an overdose of his drug of choice and is left to die), it is 
   obvious who the killers are, but they didn't count on Luddy being the 
   sanest member of this whole crazy clan, as Richard gets a face-full 
   of buckshot from a not-quite-dead-yet Delilah (a very gory scene) and 
   Luddy saves Alonzo and then turns the plantation into an orphanage 
   (or at least I think they do, although the ending can also be read as 
   two extremely fractured people living in a world of their own 
   delusion). The acting is excellent across the board (Agnes Moorehead 
   is both cantankerous and sympathetic, a rare trait that most young 
   actresses today could take lessons from) and the gore is sparse, but 
   effective. This story about a group of privileged people (who argue 
   whether martinis should have olives in them or not!) getting their 
   comeuppance should appeal to those that appreciate a good, 
   old-fashioned gothic tale with some gore trimmings. Also starring

   the killer (Luciano tells him, &quot;I photograph beautiful women, I 
   don't go around killing them!&quot;) The Inspector has four other 
   suspects he must question besides Luciano: Lebanese Catholic priest 
   (!) Omar Effendi (Antonio &quot;Nino&quot; Maimone; <B><A HREF="horror_express_1972.htm">HORROR
    EXPRESS</A></B> - 1972); mysterious snobby woman Ida Tuclidis 
   (Barbara Seidel; this film's Assistant Director); button-down 
   businessman Ben Amuchin (Nazzareno Macri) and ditzy Swedish model 
   Ingrid Stelmosson (Vera Kruska), who all give the Inspector the 
   details of what they were doing when the train car went black, but 
   one of them is lying&nbsp; (When the Inspector questions Ingrid, 
   asking her if the murder &quot;struck&quot; her in any way, she takes 
   off her hat and checks her head!). Maybe all of them are lying, but 
   does it make any of them the killer?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Ingrid, who knows Luciano, trys to help him solve the murder, along 
   with Luciano's black female friend Ulla (&quot;Susy Jennings&quot;, 
   real name: Marie Elise Eugene; who we first see having a lesbian 
   encounter with a beautiful white woman back at her place. Nudity 
   alert!), only Luciano doesn't know that Ulla has a friend and lover, 
   Raul (Nikos Verlekis; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#DevilsMen1976">THE 
   DEVIL'S MEN</A></B>&nbsp; - 1976), who was also on board the train 
   and he is blackmailing the unknown killer, as he has one of the 
   killer's gloves he found on the train, asking for $10,000 to return 
   it. Raul watches the killer deliver the money at the agreed-upon 
   location and then drive away, only when Raul goes to collect the 
   money, the killer is waiting for him and slashes Raul's throat, 
   killing him and taking both the glove and the money. When the 
   Inspector arrives at the crime scene, he finds two train ticket stubs 
   on Raul's body (The Inspector says to his nameless partner [Lefteris 
   Giftopoulos], &quot; A man doesn't buy another man a first class 
   ticket from Istanbul to Athens unless he's gay... Wait a minute, was 
   he gay?) The Inspector then questions the train's conductor, who 
   tells him that the punch marks on the stubs are his, but he has no 
   way of identifying who the tickets belonged to. The Inspector gets a 
   search warrant for Luciano's home after discovering that Luciano 
   withdrew $10,000 from his bank a few hours before Raul's murder. 
   Luciano knows he looks guilty, so he dons a disguise (a blond woman's 
   wig!) and calls his home, where Ingrid is waiting, not realizing the 
   Inspector is already there, listening on the phone (a really comical 
   moment). Luciano then goes undercover as a hooker in a bright green 
   miniskirt (!) to contact his friend, Greek dockyard worker and petty 
   criminal Salvatore (Anestis Vlahos), to give him a place to hide out, 
   not knowing that the Inspector is much smarter than he looks. 
   Salvatore gives Luciano a shack next to the railroad tracks to hide 
   out in and, a few days later, Ingrid stops by to give him newspapers 
   and food (and another comic scene, where a train rumbles by, shaking 
   the shack as if an earthquake hit it). Luciano tells Ingrid he used 
   the $10,000 he withdrew from the bank to buy some black market 
   cameras, but he couldn't tell the Inspector that because the 
   transaction was illegal. Ingrid then mentions that the &quot;black 
   chick&quot; (Ulla) was Raul's lover, so Luciano says he will talk to 
   Ulla, but first, he makes love to Ingrid (nudity alert!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then discover that the uptight Ida is getting a divorce from her 
   nameless husband (Andrew Johnson). She has the divorced planned out 
   to the very last detail, as we watch her tell her soon-to-be-ex how 
   it is going to be played out. Her husband asks her if there is 
   another man and she says no, if he wants to know why she wants a 
   divorce, he should talk to her lawyer. Is this going anywhere to 
   advance the plot? Read on... The husband tells Ida that he wants a 
   separation immediately and asks her if she wants the name of the 
   hotel he is staying at. Ida says no, it's not important to her (I can 
   see why divorce is imminent!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see Ulla singing in a nightclub (Her lips don't match the 
   lyrics we hear!), while Luciano and the nameless businessman watch in 
   the audience. Luciano threaten Ulla, saying that he will spill the 
   beans about her lesbian habits to her boss if she doesn't tell him 
   what Raul was up to. Ulla says not here, meet her back at her hotel 
   room tomorrow morning. I think we all know what that means. Ulla 
   phones her nameless (there's a lot of it in this film!) lesbian lover 
   (Imelda Marani; <B><A HREF="#MilanoCalibro9">MILANO CALIBRO 9</A></B> 
   - 1972) and tells her to clean out her hotel room of any 
   incriminating evidence. When her lesbian lover arrives at the hotel 
   room, she is murdered by the killer (all we see of the killer is an 
   extreme close-up of one of the killer's blue eyes), who first drowns 
   her in the swimming pool's filter (!) and then slices her throat with 
   the straight razor (talk about overkill!). Ulla then comes home, 
   strips naked (nudity alert!) and takes a bath. While she is in the 
   bathtub, she turns on the faucet, but all that comes out is bloody 
   water (it is never explained how the pool's filter is connected to 
   the bathtub's water supply!). She screams out her lesbian lover's 
   name (I couldn't make out what the name was, even after rewind the 
   scene several times), only to have the killer pin her head with the 
   bathroom door and finish her off with the straight razor to her neck 
   (shown in extreme close-up, as we watch the razor bloodily slice her 
   neck open).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    A short time later, the Inspector looks over the two bloody bodies 
   and wonders out loud why everyone Luciano knows is being murdered 
   (The Inspector's partner asks him how he knew the bodies were there. 
   &quot;I received an anonymous phone call&quot; says the Inspector. 
   The partner then says, &quot;From who?&quot;!). The hotel's female 
   concierge (Jessica Dublin; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#SexOfWitch1973">SEX
    OF THE WITCH</A></B> - 1973) informs the Inspector that she may have 
   heard a scream last night, but she has no idea what time it was. When 
   the Inspector shows her the front page of the newspaper, where the 
   photos of all five suspects are displayed, she recognizes one of them 
   (but we are not privy as to which one it is), telling the Inspector 
   that &quot;he&quot; tried to rent a room the previous day. Does this 
   mean that Ida is off the hook?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see Omar Effendi in a hotel room with a naked woman. It 
   turns out he is not a priest at all, telling his lover that he had to 
   don that disguise when leaving Istanbul, because someone was 
   following him. Meanwhile, Luciano comes up with a plan to unmask the 
   killer, but Ingrid will <A HREF="death_steps_in_the_dark_1977_italy_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/death steps in the park italy poster6 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>have
    to pretend to be a Swedish journalist so she can interview an art 
   gallery owner (Nikos Vandoros), who has an expensive gold plated bust 
   of Ulla in his gallery (he was also Ulla's &quot;sugar daddy&quot;). 
   Is the bubble headed Ingrid up for the challenge? The Inspector 
   catches Luciano in yet another disguise (as a bearded hippy!), but 
   when a drug dealer offers hashish and cocaine to Luciano in front of 
   the Inspector, he slaps the cuffs on the drug dealer and gives 
   Luciano 48 hours to prove his innocence. Will Luciano be able to 
   unmask the killer with Ingrid's help or will he fall victim to the 
   killer's wrath? What do you think?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   healthy dose of humor. Nearly every scene that Robert Webber is in 
   has at least one comic moment, some that work and some that don't

   on the train, he says, &quot;Hundreds of them, There's a beauty in a

   two I mentioned), is not interested in proper names, but contains all 
   the giallo staples, including full-frontal female nudity, gory

   ends much in the same way as Pradeaux's <B><A HREF="tormentor_1972_italy_ads.htm">TORMENTOR</A></B> 
   did, by breaking into a house and discovering the evidence needed to 
   reveal the killer's identity. The dialogue between Ingrid and a woman 
   we have never seen before the finale is priceless, where the woman 
   describes to Luciano and Ingrid how her grandfather, a master 
   safecracker, swallowed all the tools of his trade just before he was 
   arrested, crapping out the tools (using a powerful magnet!) and using 
   them to escape from prison! While I wouldn't say that this film is

   - 1983) is separated from his father Paul (Edward Herrmann; <B><A HREF="lost_boys_1987.htm">THE

   uproots Billy from his New Jersey home and heads to Death Valley, 
   Arizona, where Sally reconnects with high school boyfriend Mike (Paul

   dislike to Mike and proves to be a handful, as the trio head off on a 
   road trip through the desert, their destination being a Wild West 
   show at a popular ghost town tourist attraction. On their way, they 
   pull over to stretch their legs and Billy wanders off, ending up in a 
   parked RV where an unseen serial killer has just murdered a young 
   couple. Billy notices a frog-shaped necklace on the RV's floor and 
   pockets it, but before he can discover the dead bodies, Mike enters 
   and they leave. The killer, who drives a late-50's gold-colored 
   Chevrolet (the<A HREF="death_valley_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/death valley ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="256" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   type with a bullet-shaped front bumper), thinks Billy knows something 
   and begins following the trio. When they stop at a diner for a bite 
   to eat, Billy notices that one of the workers, Hal (Stephen McHattie; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#The Dark">THE
    DARK</A></B> - 1993), is wearing the identical frog necklace that he 
   stole from the RV. At the scene of an accident (it's actually the RV 
   that the killer dumped over an abutment), a guilt-ridden Billy turns 
   the necklace over to the Sheriff (Wilford Brimley; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#AmericanJustice">AMERICAN
    JUSTICE</A></B> - 1985), who immediately recognizes it. It seems a 
   series of similar murders have been plaguing the area for years and 
   the Sheriff&nbsp; now has a clue as to who the killer is. When the 
   Sheriff goes to Hal's home and confronts him with the evidence, Hal 
   tells him that it must be his brother Stu's necklace, but when the 
   Sheriff leaves the house, someone plants a pickaxe in his chest. At 
   the Wild West show, the killer disguises himself as one of the 
   stuntmen and tries to kill Billy with real bullets, but fails. 
   Oblivious to what is happening to them, Billy, Sally and Mike 
   continue on with their vacation and Billy begins to warm to Mike. Mom 
   and Mike leave Billy with a babysitter while they have a night on the 
   town and the killer strikes, slitting the babysitter's throat. Hal 
   makes an unannounced visit to Billy's motel room, but Billy manages 
   to escape. The film concludes with Mike killing Hal and the real 
   killer finally revealing himself. If I have to tell you who it is, 
   it's time for you to get a brainscan, because you may have a tumor 
   blocking your basic reasoning skills (And, no, it's not Billy's 
   father!). This is an unfortunately easy-to-solve whodunit which is 
   marred by way too much family drama and too many convenient 
   coincidences (especially the conversation Mike overhears in a bar 
   that lets him know that Billy is in real peril). Director Dick

   it should be clear to even the most brain-damaged individuals that 
   when Hal mentions his brother Stu, it has to be a twin brother. That 
   can be forgiven if all the personal issues between Billy and Mike 
   weren't so pat and unrealistic. While I have no problem with Billy 
   disliking possible new stepfather Mike, I do have a problem with Mike 
   telling outright lies to Billy about the history of the Wild West, 
   especially since Billy is so well versed on the subject. Wouldn't 
   Sally have informed Mike about what a smart little pecker Billy 
   really is? This film is so full of questionable situations like that 
   and they all go unanswered. The violence is also fairly mild for a 
   slasher flick, just a couple of sliced throats, the pickaxe murder 
   and a shooting. There's one brief shot of nudity early in the film 
   and then it's boob-free (unless you count some of the characters' 
   motivations). Peter Billingsley, in his feature film debut, gets to 
   fire a real gun in the finale, which is the film's most disturbing 
   scene. An unsuccessful mixture of <B><A HREF="kramer_vs_kramer_1979.htm">KRAMER

   young woman being murdered by a man wearing a large leather glove 
   where spikes protrude from the knuckles (we get a good look at the

   a mask to protect her identity, Gio reneging on the last part of

   She goes to leave when the man exits the elevator and begins chasing

   can't hear her. She then breaks a mirror (Seven years bad luck!) and 
   uses a piece of it in the sun to try to get Stefano's attention and 
   he finally sees her screaming bloody murder. The man breaks down the 
   door with his iron glove, but before he can kill her, Stefano shows 
   up. He doesn't believe Valentina's story, thinking it is nothing but 
   a publicity stunt (Hey jerk, look at the fucking door!), as we see 
   the killer silently sneaking away (taking full advantage of the 
   widescreen image). Gio meets Valentina and Stefano in the lobby of 
   her apartment building and Stefano says to Valentina, &quot;Next time

    Valentina can't get anyone to believe her story, but Gio tells her 
   that a young woman was killed with an iron glove...six months ago and 
   she probably had the vision because she read it somewhere (it still 
   doesn't explain how she saw the killer's face). Gio even goes as far 
   as to accuse Valentina of lying to him when they have lunch together, 
   but she sees the killer in a crowd and runs after him, with Gio not 
   far behind. The killer loses them and Gio accuses her of leading him 
   on a wild goose chase (Why is she still friends with him?). Inspector 
   Serino tells Valentina that the man who killed the young woman six 
   months ago is currently in prison. The man volunteered to be a guinea 
   pig in prison, being dosed with HDS. Gio does some digging and then 
   tells Valentina that the woman who was killed spent four years in 
   prison in Hamburg, Germany for being a drug dealer and her killer was 
   never in prison, he was committed to an insane asylum and the asylum 
   director, Professor Otto Wuttenberg (Ivano Staccioli; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Devil7Faces1971">THE

   Valentina is stopped by a woman, Verushka (Claudie Lange; <B><A HREF="flashman_1967.htm">FLASHMAN</A></B>

   that she is the sister of the murdered woman and she shows Valentina 
   photos of her sister. Valentina tells Verushka that it is not the 
   woman in her vision, she was a brunette and her sister isn't. 
   Verushka drives her to the asylum to meet the killer, but what is she

   portrayed comically by Giacomo Pergola; <B><A HREF="harry novak.htm#Mad Butcher">THE
    MAD BUTCHER</A></B> - 1972)). The nun shows them to Nicola Ravelli 
   (Giorgio White), the supposed killer, who has his back to them. 
   Verushka wants Valentina to walk up to him and identify him as her 
   sister's killer. She does just that, but it is not the man she saw in 
   her vision. For some reason, Verushka runs away and Valentina meets 
   the crippled asylum director, Professor Otto Wuttenberg, who shows 
   her the way out, Valentina not seeing the iron glove hanging on a 
   door as she leaves (I would not be giving too much away by telling 
   you that Verushka is Professor Wuttenberg's sister). Valentina takes 
   a taxi home, when she sees the killer in a hearse passing them. She 
   tells the taxi driver to follow the hearse and when the hearse gets 
   to its destination, the taxi driver, knowing who Valentina is, tries 
   to get fresh with her (!), so she knees him in the balls, losing the 
   killer. She flags down the police, who take her to the Inspector. She 
   tells him everything, but the Inspector accuses her of lying to him 
   and threatens to arrest her and Gio (For what???), but she does learn 
   some important information on the murdered woman, which leads her to 
   a nightclub, where she participates (partially) in a drug-fueled 
   orgy, but leaves before it gets interesting. As she is walking home, 
   she is chased by the killer, but loses him when she hails a cab. She 
   goes to Stefano's workshop, where he is watching a Japanese friend's 
   two young children. Valentina begins to cry, so Stefano comforts her 
   by taking her to bed and making love to her. They later play with the 
   children, who tell her that they saw her sleeping with &quot;Uncle 
   Stefano&quot;. Stefano takes her to an art gallery displaying some of 
   his sculptures. The art gallery owner tells Stefano that someone 
   hired him to build a funeral sculpture at a local graveyard, so 
   Valentina accompanies him. She meets Verushka at the graveyard and 
   someone tries to kill Valentina by toppling a heavy metal&nbsp; angel 
   statue on her, but fails. She then meets Professor Wuttenberg at the 
   graveyard and he acts strange, calling her a strange name. She and 
   Verishka drive away, but they are being followed. Think you have it 
   figured out? Why does the dead woman's handyman, Pepito (Fabrizio 
   Moresco; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#RedQueenKills1972">THE RED QUEEN 
   KILLS SEVEN TIMES</A></B> - 1972), keep bumping into Valentina? I

   when it happens, it is quite brutal. It is also light in the nudity 
   department, just flashes of Valentina's breasts and very quick 
   glimpses of the orgy, but this film has a wicked sense of humor, 
   especially the way Valentina reacts when she is accused of lying. Her 
   scenes with the Inspector are priceless and Susan Scott (who was 
   married to Luciano Ercoli from 1972 until his death in 2015) has 
   never been better than she is here. She and Sim&oacute;n Andreu have 
   a chemistry that cannot be faked, thanks to them appearing in a few

   excellent (and superbly choreographed) rooftop finale as Hans

   There's a funny scene where the Inspector and his assistant stop 
   talking in their native language and switch to talking perfect 
   English, showing us that he is much more intelligent than he lets on

    An eyepatch-wearing man on a train gets ready for bed, putting the 
   German Luger he keeps tucked in his waist under his pillow. There is 
   a knock on his cabin door and the man on the other end tells him it's 
   the conductor and he needs to check his ticket, but when he opens the 
   door, a man wearing a ski mask (all we can see are his pale blue 
   eyes) slices his neck with a knife and then rifles through his 
   belongings, but apparently doesn't find what he is looking for. We 
   are then in Paris, where Nicole Rochard (Nieves Navarro, using her 
   pseudonym &quot;Susan Scott&quot;; <B><A HREF="#AllColorsDark1972">ALL
    THE COLORS OF THE DARK</A></B> - 1972) and her fianc&eacute;, Michel 
   Aumont (Simon Andreu; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#BloodSpatBride1972">THE
    BLOOD SPATTERED BRIDE</A></B> - 1972), are in the back seat of a 
   taxi. It is obvious that they are very much in love, but as we have 
   learned in many giallo films, love is not the most important aspect 
   in a relationship. They arrive to their destination, the office of 
   the Chief of Police, who tells Nicole that over 700 million French 
   francs worth of diamonds have been stolen from the safe of a dealer 
   in Paris. Nicole's late father was a professional thief, his 
   specialty was cracking safes. It turns out that Nicole's father was 
   the eyepatch-wearing man we just saw murdered by someone trying to 
   get their hands on the diamonds. Nicole tells the Chief that her 
   father retired from the safecracking business a long time ago, he was 
   on the train because he was tired and needed a vacation. The Chief 
   warns Nicole that she better tell him all that she knows, asking her 
   if her father gave her the diamonds. If he did, then she is in 
   danger. Nicole says that her father gave her nothing, the last time 
   she saw him was two months before he was murdered. Nicole tells the 
   Chief that he's on the wrong track, smiling and laughing at the 
   unintentional (?) pun she just made, but the Chief is not smiling, 
   telling Nicole that she is making a big mistake. He hopes it won't be 
   too late when she realizes it. Michel interjects, saying to the 
   Chief, &quot;Listen...if the sermon is over, I guess we'll be 
   off&quot; and he and Nicole leave the Chief's office, but the Chief 
   tells them not to leave Paris without giving him the address where 
   they will be staying.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Nicole, who is a performance artist/stripper, gets a phone call from 
   a stranger using a portable voice box, pressing it against his throat 
   and saying that he must see her privately as soon as possible. Nicole 
   tells him to quit busting her balls, her performance at the Crazy 
   Club starts in two minutes and she will be stark naked, thinking it 
   is Michel playing a practical joke on her. We then see Nicole 
   performing at the Crazy Club, dancing provocatively in a sequin bra 
   and g-string, wearing a short black wig and wearing dark makeup all 
   over her body, making her look like a black woman (and a damn fine 
   one at that!). A man in the audience then begins filming her with an 
   8mm movie camera. He asks one of the waiters her name and to ask her 
   to join him at his table, but the waiter (after giving him her name) 
   tells him he doubts she will join him because she has another show to 
   do at the Kit Kat Klub right after this performance. Nicole is met in 
   her dressing room by Michel (He says to her, &quot;I like it when 
   you're all black&quot;, rubbing cold cream on her body to remove the 
   dark makeup [Lucky guy!]) and she gets turned on when he continues 
   rubbing his greasy hands all over her body, so they make love. As 
   Nicole leaves to do her other show, Michel asks her why they only 
   make love between her shows and she says sarcastically, &quot;Listen, 
   darling...someone has to work to keep things going, while you wait to 
   be offered a position as an ambassador. So in the meantime, it's all 
   up to me.&quot; Michel tells he she's not funny and she leaves by 
   taxi to do her second show, telling Michel not to drink too much. 
   Remember what I told you about love in giallo flicks?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At the Kit Kat Klub, the same man who was filming Nicole at the 
   Crazy Club is in the audience for this performance (Here, she looks 
   like Cher, complete with shiny beaded wig [looking very bonable!]). 
   This time, the man is waiting for her in her dressing room, telling 
   her that he enjoys watching her performances. She strips naked in 
   front of him and has him zip up her dress, promising to return for 
   future performances and then shakes her hand and leaves. When he 
   leaves, Nicole gets another phone call from the voicebox-using man, 
   who tells her if she doesn't want to end up like her father, she'll 
   tell him where the diamonds are. She tells him that she doesn't know 
   anything, a sound of fright in her voice. The man says, If you don't 
   talk, I'll kill you. You'll see, you'll recover your memory very 
   soon.&quot; Nicole walks home, but a woman is following her. Nicole 
   walks faster and faster, only to discover that the woman is an 
   overweight street hooker looking for a light for her cigarette (When 
   Nicole walks away in a huff, the hooker says, &quot;How rude!&quot;).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Nicole gets home, she pours herself a drink and a knife goes 
   whizzing past her and sticks in the wall. It was thrown by a drunk 
   Michel (they have been living together for two years) and he laughs, 
   but Nicole doesn't find it funny, telling Michel if he is so good at 
   throwing knives, he should get a job at the circus. Michel then makes 
   fun of her, telling her to &quot;wiggle her ass&quot; for him, but 
   Nicole has heard it many times before from Michel, especially when he 
   has been drinking, which has been happening a lot lately. Michel 
   tells Nicole that she's a beautiful woman (she really is), but he can 
   manage without her, her money or her ass. He's tired of people 
   thinking that he is her pimp, which is why he drinks. He's also tired 
   of waiting for her at home all night (Hey, Michel, get a hobby!). 
   Michel then drunkenly leaves their home, where we see someone in a 
   ski mask and carrying a straight razor is watching Nicole. He enters 
   the home, puts the razor to her throat and rips off all her clothes. 
   He throws her on the bed and says (in his robot-like voice), 
   &quot;With this razor you won't feel the pain right away, but it will 
   leave your body covered with horrible scars. Tell me where the 
   diamonds are and I'll leave.&quot; Nicole tells him she has no idea 
   where they are, so he traces the dull edge of the razor down her 
   body, telling her to think it over carefully, the next time he'll use 
   the sharp edge of the blade, then he leaves. Nicole goes looking for 
   Michel at his favorite bar, only to run into her not-so-secret 
   admirer, who tells her his name is Dr. Robert Matthews (Frank Wolff; <B><A HREF="great_silence_1968.htm">THE
    GREAT SILENCE</A></B> - 1968) and even though he is slightly buzzed, 
   he would like to take her away by plane and have breakfast with her 
   (Handing her his business card and telling her that he is staying at 
   the Ambassador Hotel). Nicole is too frightened to hear a single word 
   he is saying and hops in a taxi to continue looking for Michel. When 
   she gets home, she finds Michel in bed and she tells him what 
   happened to her, but he doesn't believe her, telling her it was all 
   probably a dream (Why is she with this guy???). He then apologizes to 
   her, saying that trying to find a job and people thinking that he's 
   her pimp is driving him to drink (excuses, excuses). Then they make 
   love!!! (Maybe they do deserve each other).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next morning, Nicole enters the bathroom, opens the medicine 
   cabinet and a piece of cloth falls out. Inside the cloth are two blue 
   contact lenses and what immediately comes to her mind is how her 
   assailant from the night before had the same blue eyes. She believes 
   Michel is the guilty party, so she leaves and goes to the Ambassador 
   Hotel to have Dr. Matthews whisk her away from here, but he tells her 
   that he must be in London tomorrow on business. Nicole goes to London 
   with Robert to get away from all the craziness in her life, but she 
   will soon discover that the craziness has followed her, there's no 
   escaping it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Robert treats Nicole like a queen, buying her expensive clothes and 
   taking her to fancy restaurants, but it is quite clear he has only 
   one thing on his mind, getting Nicole out of those expensive clothes 
   and into bed. Nicole wonders why Robert doesn't ask her about her 
   past and he tells her questions like that lead to answers that are 
   disappointing, he stopped asking questions like that a long time ago 
   after years of a &quot;stupid, monotonous marriage&quot; to a woman 
   named Vanessa (Claudie Lange; <B><A HREF="flashman_1967.htm">FLASHMAN</A></B> 
   - 1967). It turns out he is still married to her, as she refuses to 
   give him a divorce. He tells Nicole that thanks to Vanessa's money, 
   he has a successful clinic and considers himself a good doctor, but 
   his wife won't give him a divorce unless he returns all the money she 
   gave him, something he is not willing to do because it would mean the 
   end of his clinic (All this small stuff is essential to the plot, so 
   pay close attention!). Nicole shows her appreciation to Robert by 
   putting on private strip shows for him (Robert doesn't want her to 
   take her boots off when they make love because he likes the way they 
   look on her, contrasting with her body).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Back in Paris, Michel is trying to find Nicole and discovers from 
   the Ambassador Hotel's doorman that she left for London with Dr. 
   Matthews. Robert sets up Nicole with a nice seaside cottage as their 
   love nest, which Vanessa knows nothing about. Robert and Nicole enter 
   the small town's local bar, where he introduces Nicole as his wife to 
   barmaid Peggy (Rachela Pamenti) and the mysterious Hallory (Luciano 
   Rossi; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#StrangersGundown69">THE 
   STRANGER'S GUNDOWN</A></B> - 1969), who holds a cat in his left hand, 
   which is covered with a studded black leather glove. We learn that 
   Hallory is the cottage's caretaker and since he is played by Rossi, 
   it could only mean one thing: Wild and dangerous times are ahead. But 
   why does everyone stare at Nicole and why does Peggy give her the 
   cold shoulder? Hallory accompanies Robert and Nicole to the cottage, 
   which sits near the ocean and has it's own private dock, including a 
   small motorboat. Robert tells Nicole that when he is away on<A HREF="death_walks_on_high_heels_1971_italy_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/death walks on high heels italy poster small2.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="196" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   business or at his clinic, if she needs anything, she should phone 
   Hallory, he's reliable. Nicole tells him that Hallory makes her 
   nervous and scared, so he shows her a hidden drawer under the 
   fireplace mantle that hides a pistol (I don't know about you, but red 
   flags are being raised in my mind!). He tells Nicole that she will 
   never have to use the weapon because nothing ever happens in this 
   old, backwards town (Telling her the residents consider the tango a 
   &quot;sinful dance&quot;). When Nicole goes to town to pick up a few 
   personal items, we can see that Hallory is following her. He even 
   watches her paint her toenails with lust in his eyes, but is he doing 
   all this on his own or did Robert tell him to keep a close eye on her?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then watch as someone with a telescope is keeping close tabs on 
   Nicole, breathing heavy and watching her strip nude and go to bed. A 
   short time later, Robert and Nicole go to the bar and meet Captain 
   Lenny (George Rigaud; <B><A HREF="#Eyeball1975">EYEBALL</A></B> - 
   1975). Robert is looking to buy a bigger boat and Captain Lenny has 
   some photos for him to look at. Nicole then hears a voice that sounds 
   all too familiar and when she turns around, she sees a man on the 
   phone using a portable voicebox and the bad memories come flooding 
   back, begging Robert to take her back to the cottage.&nbsp; Once 
   there, she tells Robert to take her to London because she does not 
   like the way people look and talk about her in this small town, 
   calling it a &quot;village of the dead&quot;.&nbsp; Robert tells her 
   to be patient, he'll ask Vanessa for a divorce and then they can be 
   married. He tells Nicole that he loves her and she apologizes to him 
   for being harsh at the bar. Later that night, the person with the 
   telescope watches Nicole get a visitor, a woman whose face we don't 
   see. She tries to hand Nicole a wad of cash, but she refuses to take 
   it, so she throws it at her and leaves the cottage. We then see 
   Nicole hide the money (so does the person with the telescope). When 
   Robert returns to the cottage, Nicole isn't there and Hallory tells 
   him he has no idea where she is, he thought she was at the cottage. 
   At the bar, Captain Lenny tells Robert that everyone in town knows 
   Nicole isn't his wife (&quot;The village is too small to hide such 
   things. And people like to gossip, which is worse.&quot;). Robert 
   tells Captain Lenny that he is sure Nicole will return and gives him 
   his phone number in London, telling him to call him when she returns.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    There is a damn fine mystery in this film, particularly since no one 
   here is who they pretend to be, even Smith, who isn't as blind as he 
   acts, as he is connected to Nicole's father and the diamond robbery. 
   What confounded me is how underutilized Luciano Rossi is in this 
   film, unlike his role in <B><A HREF="death_walks_at_midnight_1972.htm">DEATH
    WALKS AT MIDNIGHT</A></B> (1972). In that film, he had a standout 
   fight scene on a rooftop that ended very badly for him, but in this 
   film he's nothing but a red herring (you can cross him off your 
   suspect list). We are given no <A HREF="death_walks_on_high_heels_1971_italy_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/death walks on high heels italy poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>reason
    as to why he wears that studded glove on his left hand (unless I 
   missed it, but I'm particularly meticulous when it comes to giallo 
   films). Ha! Ha! Ha! Gotcha! Rossi's role is key to this film, but if 
   you want to see how, you'll have to watch the film yourself. Needless 
   to say, it's wild and memorable, something I have come to depend on 
   from him. He never disappoints. No one does crazy like Luciano Rossi! 
   But is he the killer? I'm not telling. It's a shame that Luciano 
   Ercoli only directed eight films in his career (including <B><A HREF="magnificent_dare_devil_1973.htm">THE
    MAGNIFICENT DARE DEVIL</A></B> - 1973; and <B><A HREF="killer_cop_1975.htm">KILLER
    COP</A></B> - 1975), as he was a Producer by trade. All eight of his 
   films starred his wife &quot;Susan Scott&quot; and she's used to 
   eye-opening effect here, as her stripteases show off her fantastic 
   body, proving Ercoli was a very lucky man. I have never seen her more 
   fetching than in this film. (Ercoli passed away in 2015, still 
   married to her). The screenplay, by giallo veteran Ernesto Gastaldi (<B><A HREF="#StrangeViceWardh71">THE

   giallo films, is a cornucopia of female nudity and fairly restrained 
   violence, that is until Vanessa is murdered, making her death all the 
   more shocking and about as gory as any modern-day slasher flick 
   (especially the blade ripping her throat open). If you are a giallo 
   fan, this film should be on your must-see list. It's intriguing, well 
   paced, titillating and full of surprises. It should also be noted 
   that the music soundtrack, by the late <A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_3.htm#StelvioCipriani">Stelvio

   (1960)-type role: an anal retentive, woman-hating strangler who can 
   only get his jollies by making love to a mannequin he keeps locked up 
   in the basement of the apartment complex he lives in. We can trace 
   his problems back to his childhood (shown in flashbacks). When his 
   mother died, he was forced to live with his aunt who treated him like 
   a girl. One flashback shows Perkin's aunt making him babysit a infant 
   girl while she goes out. He sticks the baby continuously with a 
   safety pin and washes out the bloody diaper to hide what he has done. 
   This leads to a series of unsolved strangulations of women which has 
   lasted well over twenty years. When a man (Uwe Bohn), who has the

   We first see Stefano (Tomas Milian; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#SyndicateSadists75">SYNDICATE
    SADISTS</A></B> - 1975) lying in bed, taking fake photos of a naked 
   Fabienne (Katia Christine; <B><A HREF="#FiveWomenKiller1974">FIVE 
   WOMEN FOR THE KILLER</A></B> - 1974) by using his hands as an 
   imaginary camera. Stefano is co-owner of a successful designing firm; 
   his latest customer being a chocolate candy company in which he used 
   Fabienne to star in their commercial (It's a weird commercial with 
   Fabienne flying through the air everywhere she goes). <A HREF="designated_victim_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/designated victim british dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>The
    married Stefano wants to sell his half of the company when someone 
   offers him 220 million lire for it, but his wife, Luisa (Marisa 
   Bartoli), who actually owns his half of the business, refuses to 
   sell. It's easy to see Luisa controls the money in their marriage 
   (she's rich with family money) and she refuses to sell because she 
   believes if she does, Stefano would leave her (She's probably right). 
   Stefano angrily tells her that she may have put up the money for his 
   half of the business but it was he alone who made it successful, 
   therefore he should be able to sell it, but Luisa stands pat in her 
   decision. Stefano is a womanizer and gambler who often loses big and 
   Luisa usually pays his debts, but she is growing tired of it. Stefano 
   keeps running into a strange rich man who introduces himself as Count 
   Matteo Tiepolo (Pierre Clementi; <B><A HREF="year_of_the_cannibals_1970.htm">THE
    YEAR OF THE CANNIBALS</A></B> - 1970), who tells Stefano that this 
   is the third time in one day they have bumped into each other and if 
   it should happen a fourth time, their relationship will 
   &quot;evolve&quot;. Guess what? Yes, they run into each other for a 
   fourth time that day and begin to have a conversation. Matteo asks 
   Stefano if he ever had the urge to kill someone and Stefano laughs, 
   not taking him seriously but answering yes, saying that his wife is 
   ruining his life. Matteo then agrees to kill Luisa if Stefano will 
   murder his brother Balsamo (Ottavio Alessi; one of the screenwriters 
   of <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DamnedInVenice1978">DAMNED IN VENICE</A></B> 
   - 1978), who often physically and mentally abuses him. Stefano thinks 
   Matteo is one strange duck and tells him he will think about it, not 
   taking Matteo seriously. Stefano will soon learn that Matteo is more 
   than he seems to be; he's a cold-blooded killer who is meticulous in 
   his planning and will soon destroy Stefano's life if he doesn't 
   complete his half of the plan.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    For one thing, Matteo keeps showing up in all the same places as 
   Stefano, telling him it is just a coincidence, but we know it isn't. 
   Luisa also knows that her husband is having an affair with Fabienne, 
   thanks to a note Matteo attached to a card with a bouquet of flowers 
   he sent her; the card telling her everything about Stefano's plans 
   for the future, such as selling his half of the business behind her 
   back and moving to Venezuela with Fabienne. Luisa kicks Stefano out 
   of their home, telling him that when they first met he was a nobody 
   and now he is a nobody again; she's divorcing him and not giving him 
   a penny of her fortune. Matteo then keeps playing mind games with 
   Stefano, pushing him to the point of no return, but will he kill 
   Matteo's brother?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Stefano also has a one-night stand with pretty German tourist 
   Christina Muller (Alessandra Cardini; <B><A HREF="action.htm#RomeArmedTeeth">ROME:
    ARMED TO THE TEETH</A></B> - 1976) and after a night of passion, he 
   wakes up and can't remember a thing about the night before, only 
   knowing that he met a girl named Christina and nothing else. He 
   phones Luisa, hoping she will take him back, but Police Commissioner 
   Finzi (Luigi Casellato; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BloodstainShadow78">THE
    BLOODSTAINED SHADOW</A></B> - 1978) answers the phone, telling 
   Stefano to come immediately, his wife is dead. With no recollection 
   of the night before, the time Luisa was murdered, Stefano must try to 
   get Commissioner Finzi to believe him that he had nothing to do with 
   his wife's murder, even though all evidence points to him as the 
   killer. Since Luisa's killer wiped all fingerprints from the crime 
   scene and walked away with all of her expensive jewelry, Stefano 
   becomes prime suspect #1, even though he swears to Finzi that he 
   didn't do it. The only person that Stefano trusts is his best friend 
   Bosco (Enzo Tarascio; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BloodstainedLawn73">THE
    BLOODSTAINED LAWN</A></B> - 1973), but even he comes under suspicion 
   in Stefano's untrusting mind. When someone leaves Stefano an envelope 
   at the hotel he is staying at, which contains a piece of Luisa's 
   jewelry, Stefano trusts no one. It doesn't help that Christina has 
   vanished, as if she never existed. Could Matteo be behind all this? 
   If you answered yes, you would be right. When Matteo's framing 
   evidence against Stefano is more than he can handle, Stefano decides 
   to go through with his half of the bargain, murdering Matteo's 
   brother, but in the surprise finale, where Stefano grabs a 
   high-powered rifle Matteo has left him and pulls the trigger with the 
   police rapidly approaching, we discover what Matteo was actually 
   trying to achieve. <A HREF="designated_victim_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/designated victim italy poster4b small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>Don't

    COP</A></B> - 1978), contains some wonderful cinematography and 
   quite a few plot twists that should surprise you. Filled with copious 
   nudity, but very little graphic violence, this film is worth watching 
   if only to see a clean-shaven Tomas Milian portray a man whose life 
   is rapidly getting out of hand. Milian usually portrays a character 
   who makes other people's lives difficult, so it is refreshing to see 
   him playing an everyman whose life is being meticulously controlled 
   by Matteo, played extremely well by Pierre Clementi, who looks like 
   Russell Brand here. The more that Stefano tries to prove to 
   Commissioner Finzi that he is innocent, the guiltier he looks, thanks 
   to Matteo planning every aspect of Luisa's murder down to the 
   minutest detail, forcing Stefano to do the unthinkable, but as the 
   closing shot shows us, Stefano doesn't know what he has really done. 
   This is a quick-moving film that has much to recommend (Milian is 
   always good no matter what film he is in. He always makes a film seem 
   better than it actually is), so it comes recommended from this reviewer.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   on the eyes, too) that she elevates any film she appears in, even if 
   it is just a cameo role. One of the biggest mysteries in life is why 
   she hasn't become a major star in A-List Hollywood films. Besides 
   being a great actress, she has no problem shedding her clothes if the

   time and she brought him along on the shoot in Pennsylvania. Haim

   snorts them, he becomes paralyzed, because Don laced the cocaine with 
   a paralytic agent. He puts Stan in the bathtub and removes his 
   appendix while he is alive and puts the organ in his freezer wrapped 
   in tin foil (Don wears a mask of a human face and a blonde wig when 
   he commits acts of violence), stitching up the incision when he is 
   done. Don's agent, Ava Collins (Shepis), who still has faith in Don, 
   even though he hasn't written anything in two years, makes an 
   unexpected appearance at Don's door and wants to know why he is 
   living in a fleabag hotel. All Don can say is, &quot;I'm tired&quot;, 
   which infuriates Ava because she knows what potential he has. She 
   tries to get his blood boiling by saying &quot;There are a line of 
   good writers waiting to fill your shoes.&quot;, but Don retorts, 
   &quot;Are they any good?&quot; Ava comes back by saying that she 
   could throw a stone and find a great writer, but Don says, &quot;What 
   about a Killer? Could you find a great killer?&quot; Things take a 
   sharp turn when Don Tells Ava to go look in the bathroom (<B>Don:</B> 
   &quot;It's my greatest work.&quot;&nbsp; <B>Ava:</B> &quot;Do you 
   want me to flush it for you?&quot;). Ava sees Stan in the bathtub 
   filled with ice, still alive, but unable to speak, and she thinks Don 
   and Stan are collaborating on a script when Don shows her the 
   appendix in his freezer. She wants to see Don and Stan in her office 
   tomorrow morning to sign an exclusive contract, but Don says that she 
   has to come back to the hotel tomorrow night instead. Ava leaves and 
   Don goes back to the bathroom, where he removes one of Stan's kidneys 
   and stitches up the incision. Don plans on keeping Stan alive as long 
   as possible, feeling the pain that his love once felt. Ava arrives 
   the next night expecting to be handed a script, but Stan comes 
   stumbling out of the bathroom and Ava maces Don in his eyes because 
   she is scared for her life. Don assures Ava that he means her no harm 
   (He tells Ava that he is doing to Stan what Stan has done to him: 
   Tearing him down piece-by-piece for the past two years). When Ava 
   leaves, saying she expects a screenplay about his ordeal, Don takes 
   Stan back to the bathroom and hits him over his head several times 
   until he is still alive, but basically brain dead. He asks his 
   neighbor Spitz (Ezra Buzzington) for a major favor: He wants to 
   borrow his wheelchair (he is legless from the war), where he wheels 
   the braindead Stan to the hospital and drops him off, returning the 
   wheelchair to Spitz, where Stan is barely alive and put in Intensive 
   Care. Ava visits Don (he makes her take her shirt off to make sure 
   she is not wired, the closest we get to see Shepis nude in this 
   film), where she is worried that once Stan becomes conscious, he will 
   implicate Don, but Don tells her not to worry; he will never be able 
   to say anything. Ava thinks this screenplay will be a huge moneymaker 
   for her when Don writes the screenplay, but Don tells her he hasn't 
   written a word yet, it is still all in his head. Later that night, 
   Spitz wheels himself into Don's apartment with a huge open gash on 
   his chest and says he is calling in the favor. He wants Don to kill 
   the prostitute he was with because she is the one who cut him badly. 
   Spitz wants Don to take her behind the hotel and bash her brains in 
   with a brick. Don checks out Spitz's room and the naked prostitute is 
   still there and tells Don that Spitz is a degenerate. Don pays her 
   the $100 she is owed and tells her to leave, while Don checks out 
   Spitz's apartment and discovers that he is actually a degenerate. He 
   finds boxes of mutilated Barbie dolls and videotapes of Spitz abusing 
   the prostitutes he hires, including the last one he just let leave 
   (Don is appalled at what he sees on-screen). Don goes back to his 
   apartment and begins to stitch-up Spitz's gaping chest wound, while 
   listening to Spitz complain about his time in the military and what 
   happened to him (&quot;All I can do now is eat pussy. And I have to 
   pay for it!&quot;). Don mentions the torture tapes he found in 
   Spitz's apartment, where Spitz says he actually is fond of them and 
   watches them all the time. Don then gives Spitz a shot that he says 
   is a pain killer, but after Don gives it to him, he tells Spitz that 
   it is actually a paralyzing agent. Spitz will be unable to move but 
   will be able to see and feel everything. Spitz begins to wheel 
   himself out of Don's apartment, but only makes it halfway down the 
   hall before the drug takes effect. Don brings him to his bathroom, 
   puts on his face mask and blonde wig, throws Spitz into the bathtub 
   and cuts him into pieces while he is alive (The film's biggest flaw 
   is that we don't actually see any of the murders; they are only 
   implied. Only once in a while do we see the aftermath, like when Don 
   removed Stan's kidney). When another agent named Carter Ball (James 
   Grabowski) wants to steal Don away from Ava (We also learn that Stan 
   died in the hospital), Ana sets it up so Carter visits Don, expecting 
   Don to kill him. Another one of Don's neighbors, Jasper (Haim, doing 
   the lamest British accent I have heard in a while), mentions that he 
   saw Don wearing his mask and wig when he was wheeling Stan down the 
   hallway, so Don has no other choice but to beat his brains in with a 
   rock when they leave a bar. Don returns to his apartment, only to 
   discover that the police have taped-up his floor as a crime scene, 
   thanks to the police finding Spitz's body. Detective Turkovich 
   (Robert Di Donato) questions Don because Spitz's body was found in 
   pieces by a garbageman and the stitches on Spitz's chest are exactly 
   the same as the ones that were found in Stan's body in the hospital. 
   Don says he knows nothing about it and the detective leaves. Carter 
   pays Don a visit thanks to a collaboration between Ava and Carter's 
   prostitute girlfriend Rebecca (Tara Sukustis). Don wants to buy his 
   contract and Don tells him to come back tomorrow (uh-oh!). Don makes 
   love to the prostitute that Spitz abused, when he is visited by Ava. 
   The prostitute leaves and Ana demands a script, but Don tells her it 
   is still all in his head. Don wants Ava to just forget about him, but 
   Ava has a way of speaking <A HREF="new_terminal_hotel_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/new terminal hotel aka do not disturb poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="232" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>to
    Don to make him stay in the game. Don says that she has to come to 
   his apartment tomorrow when Carter arrives (He says to Ava, &quot;I'll
    spin the web, but you're the black widow!&quot;). When Ava leaves, 
   Don is once again visited by Detective Turkovich, telling Don that 
   there is video footage of Don and Stan entering the motel, but no 
   footage of either one of them leaving. Don kills the detective in the 
   bathroom with a claw hammer, scrubs the bathroom clean, fills a bunch 
   of hypodermic needles with all types of deadly drugs, puts a gun 
   under his chin and pulls the trigger, committing suicide (He leave a 
   note saying he is sorry and wishes Ava luck). Ava kills Carter after 
   seeing Don's body and reading the note. She stabs Carter with the 
   hypodermic needles Don left on the bathroom sink until Carter's chest 
   looks like a pin cushion. She laughs like a mad woman and then the 
   film ends with her screaming over Don's death (which she was mostly 
   responsible for and she realizes that there is no way she can get out 
   of this).&nbsp; More of a character study than a horror film or 
   thriller, this movie makes Don a decent guy who is deeply depressed 
   and he was just looking for revenge for his girlfriend's death and 
   then other people (especially Ava) get involved and it spirals out of 
   control. Don never wanted to be a mass murderer, but forces beyond 
   his control made him one. The fact that Don pays Spitz's prostitute 
   her $100 fee and then she joins him in bed a few days later proves 
   that he is a decent guy at heart. But revenge only leads to more and 
   more violence and Don learns it the hard way, but he gets his revenge 
   by blowing his brains out, since his &quot;screenplay&quot; was all 
   in his head. His suicide is a complete surprise to the viewer because 
   it is shown so matter-of-factly, but when you think about it long 
   after the film is over, you realize that it was the only choice that 
   made sense. The acting is effectively sleazy across the board 
   (Stephen Geoffreys pulls-back his normal over-acting here [unlike <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#MrHush2011">MR.
    HUSH</A></B>] and comes off like a depressed man who is just trying 
   to cope as things get worse and worse), but Corey Haim comes off the 
   worst because of his ridiculous British accent (which he said was a 
   tribute to Jason Statham!). While the blood and gore is kept to a 
   minimum (I can't really speak if there is more gore in the original 
   version, but it doesn't look like there was, since most of the 
   carnage takes place in Don's bathroom), there is plenty of topless 
   nudity (but none by Shepis, dammit!). The whole atmosphere of the 
   film feels dirty and grimy (like a fleabag hotel should), which I 
   think director/producer/writer BC Furtney (<B><A HREF="werewolf_rising_2014.htm">WEREWOLF
    RISING</A></B> - 2014) was aiming for. Still, for a film of this 
   type, a little more blood and guts wouldn't have hurt but, like I 
   said in the beginning of this review, I'll watch anything with 
   Tiffany Shepis in it and she shines here as an agent without a soul.

   third boy, who says, &quot;They're coming!&quot; &quot;They&quot; are 
   prostitutes, who have set up a meeting place in an old shack near the

   boys, Michele, uses a slingshot to shoot lizards off a rock (This may 
   not make sense now, but it will later in the film). Michele goes 
   home, where his frustrated mother (Rosalia Maggio) complains

    That night, we see 12 year-old Bruno running for his life outside 
   his house when someone hits him and knocks him out. We then see the 
   Police Commissioner (Virgilio Gazzolo) and his entire force looking 
   for Bruno. His parents tell the Commissioner that they received a 
   ransom phone call demanding six million lire in cash for Bruno's safe 
   return. They are very poor and can't afford to pay such a large sum. 
   The Commissioner tells them not to worry about the ransom. Also 
   interested in this case is newspaper reporter Andrea Martelli (Tomas 
   Milian; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Almost Human">ALMOST HUMAN</A></B> - 
   1974), who alerted the police to the ransom demand, even though the 
   caller said that if anyone alerted the police, Bruno would be killed. 
   The police set up a sting at the ransom drop-off location and capture 
   Guiseppe Barra, who pleads he is innocent. The police make him talk 
   to Bruno's parents over the phone to see if the can identify his 
   voice as that of the kidnapper, and they do. Guiseppe then leads the 
   police to Bruno's grave, but he tells them he found Bruno's dead body 
   and all he did was bury the boy. Is he telling the truth? The 
   Commissioner calls Guiseppe an &quot;imbecile&quot; and believes they

    The killer strikes again, as we see an old woman scream when she

   Martelli then interviews new town priest, Don Alberto Avallone (Marc

   her off to this town until the heat blows over. One night, while it 
   is raining out, Michele discovers someone is digging a hole. He 
   smiles at the unseen stranger and then the killer strangles Michele 
   and throws his body in the newly dug hole. Police Captain Modesti 
   (Ugo D'Alessio), who is relieved when he is told none of the dead 
   boys have been sexually assaulted, questions Patrizia about Bruno's 
   murder. He believes she may have seen the killer, but Patrizia tells

   a witch who works with old man Francesco (George Wilson), who may

    The State police are called in to perform a search and Martelli

   priest's mother.&quot; What does he mean by &quot;put up&quot;? The 
   police get a phone call from Mrs. Avallone and she tells them that 
   Maciara is hiding in a cave. The police go to the cave, but Maciara 
   is not there. A police dog uncovers the grave of a missing pre-teen 
   boy, who disappeared fifteen years earlier. It turns out the missing 
   boy was the son of Maciara and Francesco. The dogs also catch the 
   scent of Maciara and the police soon capture her. She confesses to 
   killing the three boys and her son, who she calls &quot;the son of

    This is a fantastic giallo film with many effective visual touches. 
   For those who think director Lucio Fulci is mainly a director of 
   mindless gore flicks and is not capable of delivering something 
   literate and intelligent, look no further than this film, as Fulci 
   gives us an experience that is so involving, you won't be able to 
   take your eyes off the screen. Pay particular attention to how 
   Michele firsts spots a nude Patrizia or the music used during 
   Maciara's killing by the villagers to see a true master of 
   storytelling at work. The screenplay, by Fulci, Roberto Gianviti (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Psychic1977">THE
    PSYCHIC</A></B> - 1977) &amp; Gianfranco Clerici (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NewYorkRipper1982">THE
    NEW YORK RIPPER</A></B> - 1982), is simply wonderful and sharp as a 
   tack, as the story doesn't take a single wrong turn. The old ways 
   clash with modern times in a battle that will make you think. Is all 
   this modern thinking just a waste of time? Old towns have old legends 
   and, like most legends, they are based on a morsel of truth. I really 
   don't know why I waited so long to watch this film because I have had 
   the DVD for five years. Fulci throws so much up on the screen, from 
   human drama to haunted house themes, and none of it seems extraneous. 
   It feels necessary, as all the left-field plot devices gel to a 
   delicious whole, like finding that missing jigsaw puzzle piece that 
   you have been trying to locate for weeks, just so you can see the 
   entire picture. I really cannot recommend this film enough. It is an 
   important entry in the giallo genre that bridges the gap from pure 
   mystery to gory violence (the killer's death is especially juicy and 
   memorable). One of my new favorite films. I don't say that often.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   talking to Drew's psychiatrist (Dennis Christopher), he learns that 
   Drew's father repeatedly raped her as a child. Drew's brother caught 
   him in the act and threw his father out the window, killing Dad and

    DRAGONFLY FOR EACH CORPSE</A><A NAME="DragonflyEachCorpse"></A> 
   (1973) -</B> A junkie buys some smack off the street and drives home, 
   unaware that an unknown black-gloved, hooded killer is following him. 
   As the junkie is shooting-up in his home, the killer pulls out a 
   sword hidden in his/her overcoat and hacks the junkie to death. 
   Inspector Paolo Scaporella (Paul Naschy) is assigned to the case 
   because, just like another murder he is investigating, the killer has 
   left a dragonfly on the dead body. What could this possibly mean? The 
   killer strikes again, this time stabbing a prostitute to death as she 
   walks on the sidewalk. The dragonfly murders are a 
   make-it-or-break-it case for Paolo, as his superiors view him as a 
   hot-headed violent cop (when we first see him, he's about to strike 
   an elderly flasher), who's career could be over if he doesn't solve 
   this string of murders. The hooded killer than chops-up three naked, 
   drugged-out people in an apartment with a hatchet and then destroys 
   their stash of pot and pills. He also leaves a dragonfly on each 
   victim. Paolo sees a pattern emerging (can you?) and finds an 
   important clue: One of the latest murdered victims is clutching a 
   button that was ripped-off the killer's overcoat. Paolo's wife, 
   Silvana (Erika Blanc), who works for one of the country's top fashion 
   designers, is able to discern that the button has come from a woman's 
   coat, and an expensive one <A HREF="dragonfly_for_each_corpse_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/dragonfly for each corpse british vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="154" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>at
    that. Paolo goes to a party thrown by Silvana's boss and a Professor 
   (Eduardo Calvo) there gives Paolo an historical (and valuable) lesson 
   in dragonflies and their signifigance in the murders. It becomes 
   apparent to the viewer that one of the guests at this party is the 
   killer, but which one is it? The Professor is into kinky, 
   necrophelia-like sex (where prostitutes lay in a coffin motionless), 
   but the stripper he is about to do it with is hacked apart by the 
   killer with a hatchet as she lays waiting in a casket (We see the 
   killer chop-off her hand). Paolo's investigation leads him to a 
   high-class pimp named Muhammed, who has secret dealings with Ingrid 
   (Maria Kosti), a member of the party that Paolo and Silvana attended, 
   but Paolo is beaten-up by a gang of Nazi paraphenalia-wearing goons 
   before he can question him. On Paolo's birthday the next day, a 
   giftwrapped package arrives at his home, containing the head of 
   Muhammed and a note from &quot;The Dragonfly&quot; telling Paolo that 
   he/she is going to clean up this &quot;corrupt city&quot; and that 
   he/she plans on murdering all those responsible &quot;one-by-one 
   until the city is clean&quot;. When Paolo's stoolie ends up dead 
   (with a dragonfly stuffed in his mouth) after phoning him saying he 
   has important information, Paolo figures out that the killer is 
   someone he knows. Silvana's boss also supplies an important clue 
   about the origin of the button: A Hitler-worshipping designer who 
   committed suicide a week earlier. Can Paolo solve this mystery before 
   more people end up dead? Like all good mysteries, the denouement is a 
   killer.&nbsp; This Spanish/Italian giallo, written by Paul Naschy 
   (using his real name, Jacinto Molina) and directed skillfully by 
   frequent Naschy collaborator Leon Klimovsky (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Werewolf Shadow">WEREWOLF

   murder mysteries of the early 70's. This contains all the giallo 
   staples: A gloved, masked killer; plenty of gory murders; nudity; and 
   slowly unravelling clues. This mystery is very involving and some of 
   the murders are quite good, especially the stripper in the coffin. As 
   with most giallo films, there is no shortage of red herrings, but <B><A HREF="dragonfly_for_each_corpse_1973b.htm">A
    DRAGONFLY FOR EACH CORPSE</A></B> contains people who are 
   necrophiliacs, transvestites, obviously gay (Silvana's boss), Nazi 
   bikers and gangsters. Also, as with a lot of giallo films, a photo 
   (and a drawing) holds an important clue in solving the mystery. When 
   Silvana thinks she's figured it out, a stubborn Paolo says to her, 
   &quot;Conclusions! Intuitions! What I need are realities!&quot; as he 
   storms out the door. This sets up the film's excellent conclusion, 
   which I will leave for you to discover. This is a rare example of 
   Naschy portraying a good, if flawed, regular joe rather than a 
   werewolf, hunchback or bloodthirsty criminal. The rest of the cast,

   plays fast and loose with the facts, stretching the credibility of 
   it's &quot;Based On A True Story&quot; disclaimer. The first fact you 
   will have to erase from your mind (if you are familiar with the Ed 
   Gein story) is that hulking actor/stuntman Kane Hodder (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hatchet2007">HATCHET</A></B> 
   - 2007) is portraying Wisconsin killer Ed Gein. It is well known that 
   the real-life Gein was a somewhat scrawny man (Steve Railsback, who 
   portrayed Gein in <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Ed Gein">ED GEIN</A></B> 
   [2000], was much closer in body build and stature), so this was a 
   serious mistake on Feifer's part (nothing against Hodder here) if he 
   wants us to take the story seriously. Another distraction is the many 
   anachronisms on view (Calling 911 in 1957? I don't think so!), which 
   also hurts the film. The film opens with one of Gein's female victims 
   waking up, only to realize she is in Ed's barn, hanging by two hooks, 
   which have pierced the flesh of her shoulders. She wriggles free (the 
   flesh on her shoulders rips open, releasing her from the hooks) and 
   tries to escape, but Gein is waiting for her. The credits then roll, 
   showing a mixture of real newspaper and crime scene photos (even 
   showing a photo of the real Ed Gein!) with obviously fake ones 
   (including staged b&amp;w gore photos of Ed's victims). The story 
   then shifts focus between Gein and way-too-earnest <A HREF="ed_gein_butcher_of_plainfield_2007.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ed gein the butcher of plainfield dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="209" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Deputy

   Gein's latest female victim and vows to solve the crime. Bobby (who 
   is based on real-life Deputy Frank Worden) has a lot going on in his 
   life, as he lives with his sickly religious mother, Vera (Priscilla 
   Barnes; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#TrailerParkOfTerror">TRAILER 
   PARK OF TERROR</A></B> - 2008), wants to marry his virginal 
   girlfriend Erica (Adrienne Frantz) and is investigating a series of 
   grave robberies in the local cemetery. Those grave robberies, of 
   course, are being committed by Gein, with an assist by friend Jack 
   (Michael Berryman; <B><A HREF="hills_have_eyes_1977.htm">THE HILLS 
   HAVE EYES</A></B> - 1977; <B><A HREF="deadly_blessing_1981.htm">DEADLY
    BLESSING</A></B> - 1981), but when Jack refuses to help Gein 
   anymore, Gein kills him with a shovel and drags his body behind his 
   pickup truck, right pass a necking Bobby and Erica! When Gein 
   strangles local barmaid Sue (Caia Coley) and disposes of her body, by 
   crucifying and then cutting her into pieces with a hacksaw (Gein has 
   severe mother issues, as he sees his abusive dead mother's face 
   nearly every time he talks to a woman), her husband files a missing 
   persons report and Bobby is put in charge of finding her. Bobby makes 
   a connection between the grave robberies and the missing women when 
   he finds a key piece of evidence, but when his mother Vera ends up 
   missing from her job in the General Store, Bobby gets into a bad car 
   accident when he races back to Plainfield and Erica is badly injured 
   when she is thrown from the car. In one of the biggest plot 
   contrivances in film history, Bobby leaves Erica by the side of the 
   road while he sets out on foot to find help, only to have Gein show 
   up and kidnap her. When Bobby returns with help, Erica is gone (she 
   is now in Gein's barn having her broken leg set) and Bobby calls the 
   police station (He dials 911 on a rotary pay phone!), but nobody 
   answers! Can Bobby and the police department save Erica before she 
   becomes his next victim?&nbsp; While this pretends to be a serious 
   look at the life of an infamous serial killer (including numerous 
   references to God and religion, which is a cop-out in my opinion), 
   director/writer Michael Feifer (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Graveyard2006">THE
    GRAVEYARD</A></B> - 2006), who lately seems to be carving (pardon 
   the pun) a career out of making &quot;true life&quot; serial killer 
   flicks (for more titles, see my review of <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BTK2007">B.T.K.</A></B>,
    also starring Hodder), piles-on inaccuracy after inaccuracy until 
   this film is nothing but a joke. When the Sheriff (Tim Oman) says, 
   &quot;We want Plainfield to return to being...plain&quot; to a bunch 
   of reporters outside the police station, I let out an audible groan. 
   When Bobby discovers his mother's butchered body in Gein's barn and 
   delivers a long speech to her corpse about telling his Daddy in the 
   afterlife that he will not give up until Gein is captured, I laughed 
   out loud. I hardly doubt that was Feifer's intentions. This is also 
   one of those films that is purposely drained of color, giving the 
   film a predominantly reddish brown tinge. I guess it's supposed to 
   give the film a 50's documentary feel, but it looks to me that it was 
   also done to soften some of the gruesome makeup effects, such as when 
   Gein wears the skins of his victims; his setting of Erica's broken 
   leg (the film's toughest scene to watch); and the cops' grisly 
   discoveries in Gein's house. One unintentionally funny death finds 
   Gein pinning a cemetery security guard's head between the fork of a 
   tree and then smashing his head in with a tree branch. I hardly think 
   that the life of a serial killer has to be embellished with 
   non-existent characters, half-truths and deaths that never happened, 
   but, apparently, that's exactly what Feifer thinks is needed to sell 
   DVDs. Also starring John Burke, Stan Bly and Matteo Indelicato. A <A HREF="http://www.lionsgatefilms.com">Lionsgate

   Robert Knight (Bernie White; <B><A HREF="quarantine_2008.htm">QUARANTINE</A></B>

   since he was a young boy, totally disagrees about his uncle; he is 
   convinced that he saw Uncle Charles kill his father and rape his

   spent at the mental hospital have not been good for Robert's psyche, 
   because he is now convinced that he is an instrument of God who must 
   save his nine year-old cousin Deborah (Lauren Woodland; the <B><A HREF="alien_nation_the_series_1989-1990.htm">ALIEN

   to his doctor: &quot;She is beautiful and innocent. She is not yet 
   infected with their sin.&quot; He also says this about Joanne and 
   Charles: &quot;She and that vile man are the foxes. They're the 
   little foxes that spoil the vines.&quot; Charles and Joanne have been 
   trying to get Robert declared legally insane (they stand to inherit 
   the family fortune if he is) through their lawyer, Ralph Duris (Grag 
   Mullavey; who has appeared in many Leder films), but Robert's doctor 
   and orderly friend (James Avery; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Nightflyers">NIGHTFLYERS</A></B> 
   - 1987) think Robert can be fixed and released back into society. 
   Charles has a nurse at the hospital on his payroll (she does arm 
   curls at her desk with white dumbbells!) and she does everything in 
   her power to drive Robert over the edge so she can perform

   on the color white (see how many objects you can spot using that

   sex from an middle-aged motel clerk (who then threatens to turn him

   his killing spree so shocking. Sure, most of these people deserve 
   their fates (not too sure about the chauffeur, though), but he thinks 
   of himself as a man of the cloth and he takes his &quot;orders&quot; 
   from God, so he's not murdering these people, he is &quot;saving&quot;
    them (just like all devoutly religious nutbags throughout history). 
   While not very bloody (just a couple of stabbings and bloody bullet 
   squibs), <B><A HREF="11th_commandment_1987b.htm">THE ELEVENTH COMMANDMENT</A></B>

    A group of people are taking a bus tour of Barcelona, Spain (filmed

   the left eyes of his (or her) victims. We are introduced to the group 
   and nearly all of them seemingly have something to hide. There's 
   Paulette Stone (Martine Brochard; <B><A HREF="action.htm#ViolentProfession73">THE

    Mark calls the asylum to check up on his wife, only to learn that 
   she was never admitted. He discovers that she is in Barcelona. This 
   triggers a flashback where Mark finds Alma unconscious next to a 
   pool; in her left hand is the same bloody dagger that the killer 
   uses. Also next to her is a human eye. Mark picks up the dagger and 
   pockets it, not telling anyone what he saw. This is why Alma was 
   supposed to be in the asylum. Back in the present, Mark discovers 
   what hotel Alma is staying at in Barcelona, but he just misses her, 
   as she has just checked-out. He discovers she is about to leave for 
   New York, so he goes to the airport, only to learn that she canceled

   was killed in a muddy area). Inspector Tudela has no other choice but

    Lisa is the next to be killed as she is developing some photos in

   ponchos to go along with the gloves, stabs Lisa in the torso and then 
   slits her throat, but doesn't take an eye. The killer rifles through 
   some developed proofs and almost gets caught by Lisa's lesbian lover

   Father Bronson goes to visit Naiba in the hospital, but he disappears 
   just when the killer tries to kill Naiba, but fails. Now Inspector 
   Tudela is looking at the good Father as a suspect. He also discovers 
   that all the missing eyes were the same color and the killer is 
   right-handed. Once back in her hotel room, Naiba receives a package 
   sent by Lisa, which are some photos she developed previously. One of 
   the photos show who the killer really is. Naiba tries to find Rev. 
   Bronson, but he is nowhere to be found, not even in the local church. 
   Naiba makes a discovery at the church that puts her life in mortal 
   danger. She watches as the killer removes the eye of a dead young

   Julie (Rosemary Dexter) has a nightmare where her boyfriend Lucas 
   (Horst Frank) is viciously stabbed to death by some black 
   glove-wearing assailant. When she wakes up, she finds out that Lucas 
   is missing and hasn't shown up at the psychiatric hospital, where he 
   worked as a doctor. After leaving the hospital and going back home, 
   Julie finds a mysterious sunglass-wearing stranger waiting for her. 
   He slaps her around while asking her where Lucas is and when she 
   answers that she doesn't know, he leaves but warns her to keep her 
   mouth shut. Of course, curiosity gets the best of Julie and one word, 
   &quot;Maracudi&quot;, seems to be the link to Lucas' disappearance. 
   The investigation leads Julie to the small strange town of Maracudi, 
   where someone tries to kill her (by dropping a ceiling on her in an 
   abandoned building) when she mentions Lucas' name. She meets an 
   all-too-friendly elderly gentleman named Frank (Adolfo Celi) in town 
   and he puts her up in a boardinghouse run by a weird spinster and a 
   peeping tom artist named Saro (Benjamin Lev). The boardinghouse walls 
   are full of paintings done by local artists and one of them will lead 
   Julie to the truth about Lucas' disappearance. Frank sends Julie to a 
   villa owned by Gerda (Alida Valli) that's a commune full of oddball 
   artists and actors, in her search for Lucas. Julie spends the night 
   (her clothes are stolen when she goes <A HREF="eye_in_the_labyrinth_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/eye in the labyrinth italian poster small2.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="232" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>skinnydipping
    in the ocean), plays Scrabble with the residents (she spells 
   &quot;assassino&quot;, which visibly upsets some players) and notices 
   a book in Gerda's library which looks exactly like a book she gave 
   Lucas, but Gerda denies it (Later on, Julie sneaks down to the 
   library for a peek at the book and it is, indeed, the same book she 
   gave Lucas). Frank (who we find out is an American gangster living in 
   exile) takes an unhealthy interest in Julie, checking-up on her 
   constantly (even phoning her and hanging up) and he eventually tries 
   to kiss her, but she rebuffs him. In Julia's continuing 
   investigation, she discovers that Frank and Gerda were once lovers 
   and business partners (their business being of the illegal variety), 
   Lucas raped one of Gerda's residents, photographer Toni (Sybil 
   Danning, here billed as &quot;Sybill Dunning&quot;) and that Saro may 
   have painted Lucas' murder. This all leads to another attempt on 
   Julie's life, where she is locked in a garage with a running car. 
   Frank saves her, but it becomes clear that everyone in this town 
   (including Julia) is harboring one secret or another. Will Julie be 
   able to uncover the truth about Lucas' disappearance before it's too 
   late?&nbsp; This Italian/German co-production, directed by Mario

   - 1977) is an interesting giallo film, full of weird angles and 
   camera flourishes. As the film progresses, it becomes apparent to the 
   viewer (and eventually Julie) that Lucas is/was a real 
   son-of-a-bitch. As we learn in flashbacks from the people in town who 
   have had contact with Lucas, he was a rapist, blackmailer (a 
   surprising scene where one of the major characters turns out to be a 
   transgender), drug dealer and much worse. We just have to figure out 
   who hated him the most (The answer is not that surprising, as the 
   clues are there if you look for them). While not particularly bloody 
   (save for the opening nightmare sequence, which looks to have been 
   influenced by German impressionist films of the 20's), the film is 
   still an enjoyable murder mystery, where the actresses get naked as 
   much as possible and Julie is constantly put in a lot of danger (the 
   brake line in her car is cut; someone shoots a speargun bolt at her; 
   etc.), but she somehow survives it all. The weird jazz soundtrack 
   also enhances the film, adding a spark of atmosphere to the chase and 
   death scenes. Adolfo Celi (<B><A HREF="action.htm#Manhunt1972">MANHUNT</A></B>

   sympathy and menace, sometimes in the same scene. Director Caiano 
   bathes the film in yellows (a giallo staple) and blues, lighting 
   scenes in neon colors and outfitting people in bright primary colors 
   (at one point, Julie drives her yellow Fiat into a BP gas station and 
   all we see is yellow!). Colors also play an important part in solving

   (1972) and many other Italian genre films. He really shines here as a 
   Chief Detective who is dying of a brain tumor, whose fragile memory 
   may hold clues to who is killing people and collecting their body 
   parts. Before I get too far ahead of myself, here's a long synopsis 
   (Is there such a thing?) of the film's plot.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film opens with Inspector Giacomo Amaldi (Luigi Lo Cascio) and 
   his partner, Inspector Nicola Frese (Jose Angel Egido), chasing down 
   a rapist, cornering him in an alley. After Giacomo slaps the cuffs on 
   him, he shoots the rapist in the leg, knowing his partner will back 
   him up, saying the shooting was necessary. As the opening credits 
   roll, we see someone killing a live squirrel (by injection), cutting 
   it open and then performing taxidermy on it, giving us a step-by-step 
   procedural of the process. The taxidermy man then goes to a field 
   with a high-powered rifle, pours resin on a tree branch and sprinkles 
   live worms on it, dropping a spool of fishing line in the process. He 
   hears a woman moaning and goes to investigate, finding an elderly 
   voyeur watching a young couple making love in the field. He shoots 
   and kills the old voyeur and turns the rifle towards the couple, 
   shooting the young man in the back and putting a big bullet hole in 
   the young woman's left breast (a very graphic image). He then 
   finishes off the woman by crushing her head with the butt of his 
   rifle, slamming it on her cranium over and over (the killings are 
   juxtaposed with a bird screaming on the tree branch, as it is stuck 
   in the resin and can't fly away). What we have just witnessed is a 
   serial killer in the making.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Giacomo and Nicola arrive at the crime scene and notice that whoever 
   performed these killings did so with extreme violence. Even stranger 
   is that the killer took the time to cut up a blanket and stuffed the 
   pieces in the woman's left breast, sewing it shut with fishing line, 
   as if he was trying to repair it. Is this the killer's signature? 
   Well, yes and no. Once the two Inspectors are back in their office, 
   Chief Detective Augusto Ajaccio (Simon Andreu; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#BloodSpatBride1972">THE
    BLOOD SPATTERED BRIDE</A></B> - 1972) tells them that he has to go 
   to the hospital because he hasn't been feeling well lately, so he 
   will be there for a few days while they run some tests. Pretty young 
   college girl Giuditta (Lucia Jimenez) walks into the department and 
   wants to talk to a detective, so Giacomo volunteers. She tells him 
   someone is following her and leaving creepy phone messages for her. 
   It's like this man knows everything about her life. It is rather 
   obvious that Giuditta and Giacomo are attracted to each other, so he 
   gets involved in her case heavily, maybe too much, but other more 
   pressing matters may push it to the background.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At the hospital, Chief Detective Ajaccio tells Giacomo and Nicola 
   that he just found out that he is dying of an inoperable brain tumor 
   and he only has a short time to live, continuing with he's led a 
   &quot;wasted&quot; life and that no one will mourn him when he passes 
   away, his whole life has been devoted to the police department and he 
   has no personal life. He then has some type of spell, caused by the 
   brain tumor, saying that he smells something burning and he travels 
   back to when he was a child living at an orphanage, where he sees a 
   mysterious young boy looking at him while the orphanage burns (later 
   we learn that two nuns and five young boys died in the fire). He 
   shows the two Inspectors some burn scars on his chest, something they 
   have never seen before, also not knowing that he was an orphan. 
   Ajaccio's physician, Dr. Civita (Eusebio Poncela; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Apartment13thFl72">THE
    APARTMENT ON THE 13TH FLOOR</A></B> - 1972), tells Giacomo and 
   Nicola that the brain tumor is playing tricks with Ajaccio's memory, 
   but, as we discover as the film progresses, these memories are key to 
   solving the case.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see antique dealer Viviana Justic (Yordanka Kuzmanova) phone 
   the killer, telling him she has found an antique, anatomically 
   correct life-size doll, just as he requested. She tells him not to 
   worry about the price because his mother was good to her when she was 
   alive, so her price will be more than fair. When the killer arrives 
   at her shop, he is not interested in price, so he kills her. When 
   Giacomo and Nicola arrive on the scene, they discover that Viviane 
   Justic's arms have been cut off and replaced with the life-size 
   doll's arms, which are surgically connected to her body (the rest of 
   the doll is nowhere to be found). But it is what they discover the 
   killer did to her face, applying two hooks to the ends her mouth and 
   using fishing line to pull the hooks tightly, tying it to the back of 
   her head, giving her a macabre smile, that both Giacomo and Nicola 
   realize that this death is connected to the killings in the field. 
   They have a serial killer on their hands. Giacomo searches the 
   antique shop and discovers three small leaves tacked to the underside 
   of a drawer of Viviane Justic's desk. He knows they mean something, 
   but he doesn't know what, so he goes to his old college anthropology 
   teacher, Professor Avildsen (Carmelo Gomez), to find out what the 
   leaves mean. The Professor, who is also Giuditta's teacher, says he 
   is certain it does mean something, but before he says anything 
   concrete, he will have to do some research and will get back to him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Back at the hospital, Dr. Cerusico (Ernestina Chinova) tells Dr. 
   Civita that some supplies are missing from surgery, namely a bone 
   saw, some scalpels and red grease pencils. Dr. Civita seems more 
   interested in romantically connecting with her (they were lovers 
   previously), but she tells him she is busy tonight, she has a date. 
   When Dr. Cerusico checks up on Chief Detective Ajaccio, she discovers 
   that someone has written his full name across his chest in red grease 
   pencil. Giacomo and Nicola question her about the grease pencil 
   (Giacomo found a red grease pencil line on Viviana Justic's neck) and 
   she tells them that red grease pencils are used to mark the area 
   where a surgeon is to make an incision, but before she can say any 
   more, she gets a phone call and tells the person on the other end 
   that she will see him tonight at her apartment, she is looking 
   forward to it. Wanna bet?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Giacomo does some research on the importance of leaves at the 
   library and runs into Giuditta, so they decide to go out to dinner. 
   In the middle of dinner, out of nowhere, Giacomo realizes that Dr. 
   Cerusico is in mortal danger, so he calls Nicola and tells him to 
   meet him at the doctor's apartment immediately (We see Dr. Cerusico's 
   &quot;date&quot; drug her wine and then see her tied-up on the floor, 
   where he approaches her with a bone saw). Giacomo gets up and leaves, 
   not even saying goodbye to Giuditta and when he and Nicola get to Dr. 
   Cerusico's apartment, they discover that her legs have been cut off 
   and surgically replaced with the doll's legs. Giacomo finds two small 
   leaves at the crime scene and now knows what they mean (even though, 
   previously, Professor Avildsen told him the supernatural meaning of 
   leaves in various cultures). It means the serial killer has two more 
   victims to go. All evidence points to the killer needing a human 
   torso and a human head to complete his &quot;masterpiece&quot;. 
   Giacomo and Nicola also discover a phrase in Latin, written in Dr. 
   Cerusico's blood on a wall that will eventually lead Giacomo to 
   discover what &quot;V.I.T.R.I.O.L.&quot; stands for. Will the serial 
   killer be able to complete his masterpiece and who will be his final 
   two victims? Or will Giacomo and Nicola be able to stop him?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   playing a practical joke on Giuditta (some fucking joke!). Just as

   closer to the giallo films of the '70s in both spirit and execution, 
   helped by the fact that Simon Andreu is involved and one of the 
   screenwriters is Franco Ferrini, who wrote or co-wrote the giallo 
   flicks <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#RingsOf Fear1978">RINGS OF FEAR</A></B>

   (1987) and many of his other films in the '90s and New Millennium. 
   But the film really belongs to director/co-screenwriter Eros 
   Puglielli (<B><A HREF="eros_puglielli_films.htm">AD PROJECT</A></B> - 
   2006; <B><A HREF="eros_puglielli_films.htm">NEVERMIND</A></B> - 
   2018), who gives this film some great location photography (filmed 
   mainly in Bulgaria, which is why many of the actors here have the 
   letter &quot;v&quot; in their names) and some great cinematography 
   (including a shot of a fly Ajaccio sees in his hospital room that 
   must be seen to be appreciated). The technical and acting credits are 
   all above board, especially the acting by Luigi Lo Cascio as Giacomo 
   and Simon Andreu as Augusto Ajaccio, who has his head actually shaved 
   for the later scenes in this film (and it is easy to see it is not a 
   bald cap). What I particularly admired is that nearly every character 
   in the film is hiding a secret from their past that helps explain 
   their actions today. Giacomo tells Giuditta a story about something 
   that happened to him as a sixteen-year old that helps explains why he 
   shot the rapist in the beginning of the film. All these secrets a 
   make a nice heady stew for the viewer, giving each character more 
   depth than usual in this type of film. Another thing I admired is 
   that Giacomo and Nicola make a great team, but they do their best 
   work when they are alone, separated from each other. Those two 
   ingredients make this film memorable to me, as it has enough meat on 
   its bones to make a tasty gourmet dinner for your brain. I wish most 
   films today aspired to such lofty goals, but the sad fact is, most of 
   them are junk food. Yes, junk food is good every now and then, but 
   not every day, which is what makes this film a revelation to me and 
   gets my highest recommendation.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   (1988) -</B> Lower-tier slasher film nonsense with a slight giallo 
   vibe. When college boy Jeff (Ken Roberts) refuses the sexual advances 
   of the nearly naked Stephanie (the single-monikered Kitty) and leaves 
   her sorority house, she is visited a few moments later by an unknown 
   black-gloved killer, who chases Stephanie to her bedroom and 
   strangles her with one of her silk stockings. It seems Jeff is still 
   in love with ex-girlfriend Lisa (Michelle McCormick; <B><A HREF="sweet_justice_1992.htm">SWEET
    JUSTICE</A></B> - 1992) and, after talking to Professor Caldwell 
   (Alex Courtney; <B><A HREF="programmed_to_kill_1987.htm">PROGRAMMED 
   TO KILL</A></B> - 1987) about losing his one true love years ago (all 
   this is happening while they are playing a game of chess, which Jeff 
   loses), Jeff decides to confront Lisa and win her back. It won't be 
   easy, though, because Jeff's ex-best friend Brad (Steven Henry) is 
   also romantically interested in Lisa and when Stephanie's body is 
   found by the police (one of the detectives is portrayed by porn star 
   Herschell Savage, here using the name &quot;Harvey Cowen&quot;), Brad 
   implicates Jeff of the murder in front of Lisa (Brad saw Jeff leaving Stephanie's<A HREF="fatal_pulse_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/fatal pulse vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   sorority house just before she was murdered). Jeff and Lisa rush over 
   to the sorority house just in time to see the body carted away and 
   when the detective asks Jeff his name, he runs away (Don't make 
   yourself look too guilty, Jeff!). The list of suspects in Stephanie's 
   murder doesn't just include Jeff. There's sorority house owner Ernie 
   (Joe Estevez; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Lockdown1990">LOCKDOWN</A></B> 
   - 1989; here using the pseudonym &quot;Joe Phelan&quot;), who suffers 
   from frequent Nam flashbacks; Professor Caldwell, whose discussion 
   with Jeff about lost loves makes him appear to be a misogynist; Brad, 
   who may be killing girls to make Jeff look guilty; Jeff's pot smoking 
   pal Mark (Blair Karsch), who may be hiding a deadly secret; or any 
   one of the sorority girls themselves, including Lisa. The next victim 
   of the black-gloved killer is music student Carol (Sky Nicholas), who 
   has her throat slit open with a record album (the film's most unusual 
   kill). Jeff tries to talk Lisa into moving in with him after Carol's 
   death and they get it on, which doesn't please Brad at all. Jeff and 
   Mark go to Carol's murder site to look for clues (because the police, 
   you know, don't know how to look for them), but they find nothing 
   except a chalk outline of Carol's body and a big bloodstain where her 
   neck was. Sheila (Maureen O'Hanlon) is the next to die, drowned in 
   her tub by the killer. Cassie (Cindra Hodgdon) is the next to bite 
   it; she's kidnapped while jogging and then electrocuted by the killer 
   with some strange get-up in the shower. Ann (Roxanne Kernohan) is 
   tossed out of the top floor window of the sorority house and Karen 
   (Christie Mucciante) is smothered in plaster of paris, as Brad and 
   the police chase Jeff throughout the college. When Jeff accidentally 
   knocks-out Brad, he makes a discovery that will clear his name and 
   point the police to the right person. Will Jeff save Lisa in time 
   before the killer makes her the final victim?&nbsp; The first thing 
   you'll notice about <B><A HREF="fatal_pulse_1988b.htm">FATAL PULSE</A></B>,
    directed/produced by Anthony J. Christopher (<B><A HREF="platinum_triangle_1989.htm">THE
    PLATINUM TRIANGLE</A></B> - 1989; <B><A HREF="day_of_redemption_2004.htm">DAY
    OF REDEMPTION</A></B> - 2004) and written by James Hundhausen, is 
   how unlikely a heterosexual romantic lead Ken Roberts is as Jeff. 
   It's quite obvious by his speech patterns and mannerisms that Roberts 
   is a homosexual (if he's not, then I'm sincerely sorry, but I think 
   the only way you can accept him as straight is if you delude yourself 
   into believing that Kiki Dee actually broke Elton John's heart), so 
   casting him as the romantic lead is a huge misstep. His, and nearly 
   everyone else's, stabs at acting are of a sub-soap opera level. As a 
   matter of fact, the entire film has an 80's porn feel to it, from the 
   over-cranked synth score, barebones sets, substandard acting and flat 
   photography. At least director Christopher had the good sense to have 
   most of the female cast get naked, but the majority of the time, 
   their nakedness comes at the points of their demises (the killer has 
   a nasty habit of ripping off their tops before doing them in), so the 
   nudity is not erotic or titillating. Most of the killings are 
   bloodless (besides the record album throat slitting), as the killer 
   likes to use his hands more than any foreign objects. The killer's 
   identity is way too easy to guess, since it's obvious that all the 
   other suspects are blatant red herring material. The explanation for 
   the killer's motive comes straight out of Stevenson's &quot;The 
   Strange Case Of Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde&quot; and is as ridiculous as 
   it gets. Good for an unintentional laugh or two, but not much else.

    done much better (There's no one humming &quot;Time is on my side, 
   yes it is.&quot; in the first film), but since this 1990 film was 
   directed and written by Robert Resnikoff, whose only other claim to 
   fame was co-writing the screenplay to the awful Jay Leno/Pat Morita 
   action comedy <B><A HREF="collision_course_1986.htm">COLLISION COURSE</A></B> 
   (made in 1986, but dumped directly to home video in the U.S. in 
   1989), this film offers very little to the supernatural action film 
   genre lover except for a larger-than-usual role for character actor 
   supreme Jeff Kober (<B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Automatic1994">AUTOMATIC</A></B> 
   - 1994) and trying to spot some genre actors in small, nothing roles 
   (like Bill Moseley as a bartender). Besides a couple of good stunts 
   (you will know them when you see them), the film mostly comes up 
   snake eyes because the plot is very underdeveloped and once this film 
   was finished, Robert Resnikoff was never seen or heard from in the 
   filmmaking business again. That right there should tell you 
   something. Since MGM released a perfectly good anamorphic widescreen 
   release of this film on DVD in the early 2000's, it surprises me that 
   Kino Lorber/Scorpion Releasing would give this film the DVD and 
   Blu-Ray treatment (probably using the same print master as the MGM 
   DVD) when there are so many more MGM titles screaming to be released 
   on disc for the very first time. Maybe it was a contractual thing, 
   but it was a poor choice to release it as a stand-alone feature. This 
   at least belongs on a double feature Blu-Ray with some other film so 
   you can get more bang for your buck. This is just a minor potboiler 
   with lofty aspirations that it fails to achieve. The film opens with 
   Sister Marguerite (Elizabeth Arlen; <B><A HREF="lucky_stiff_1988.htm">LUCKY
    STIFF</A></B> - 1988; also with Jeff Kober) pleading with the 
   Cardinal (Philip Abbott; <B><A HREF="hangar_18_1980.htm">HANGAR 18</A></B> 
   - 1980), the Monsignor (David Gale; <B><A HREF="reanimator_1985b.htm">RE-ANIMATOR</A></B> 
   - 1985) and Father Brian (Hansford Rowe) that something must be done 
   about Satan and his minions. She tells them that Satan's powers are 
   growing and that there have been 15 women murdered this year alone in 
   this town with an inverted pentagram carved in their stomachs. As is 
   normal with religion, the males belittle the woman (The Monsignor 
   makes a joke about ending up on &quot;Geraldo&quot;) and tell her to 
   go back to her convent and keep her mouth shut. Detective Russ Logan 
   (Lou Diamond Phillips; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Route 666">ROUTE 666</A></B> 
   - 2001) is after a murderer called the &quot;Pentagram Killer&quot; 
   (the same person Sister Marguerite was talking about) and has hit a 
   dead end until he gets a phone call from Tess Seaton (Tracy Griffith; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Skeeter">SKEETER</A></B> 
   - 1993), telling him that the Pentagram Killer will strike again 
   tonight on Sunset Boulevard (when Logan marks the location on the 
   murder map, it forms a perfect pentagram, a trope used in many other 
   horror films), but she has one strange request: If Logan catches him, 
   he cannot let the killer die on Death Row and she makes Logan 
   promise. Logan makes the promise, but he has no intention of keeping 
   it. That rainy night, a stakeout crew is sent out to the location 
   (including Brian Libby, who played a serial killer in the underrated 
   Chuck Norris film <B><A HREF="silent_rage_1982.htm">SILENT RAGE</A></B> 
   [1982], who pretends to be a bum lying on the ground covered in 
   newspaper and he says, &quot;Only a psycho fucking killer is smart 
   enough to stay out of the rain.&quot;). Logan is cruising the area 
   with his partner Detective Oliver Franklin (Mykel T. Williamson 
   [a.k.a. Mykelti Williamson]; <B><A HREF="species_2_1997.htm">SPECIES II</A></B> 
   - 1997) when they get word that Officer Carmen (Sue Giosa), who was 
   the bait, is missing. They both race to an abandoned concrete 
   structure to save her, where we see her tied to the ground with the 
   Pentagram Killer (Jeff Kober) waving a knife around and wearing an 
   ugly old man mask. He is very polite in the way he tells Carmen the 
   way he is going to kill her and puts the mask over her face. Before 
   he can do anything to her, Logan and Franklin intervene. Franklin 
   gets knocked out, but Logan chases and catches him, even after being 
   seriously stabbed in the stomach by the killer (Logan is a highly 
   decorated officer who caught three serial killers in his short 
   career). We find out that the Pentagram killer is really Patrick 
   Channing, a mild mannered worker for the Public Water Department and 
   no one can understand how he could do such horrible things. He is 
   convicted in a court of law for 15 murders and sentenced to die in 
   the gas chamber in San Quentin Prison. Logan once agan gets a call 
   from Tess, who says he must keep his promise, but he and Franklin 
   watch a smiling Channing die in the gas chamber. Logan sees 
   Channing's hand move after he is dead and then he breaks his straps, 
   shatters the chamber's glass window and heads towards Logan with a 
   knife in his hand while Logan empties his gun into him. with no 
   effect. That last part is a recurring nightmare Logan has had since 
   he witnessed Channing die and he starts having more vivid 
   halucinations, like one of the rooms in his apartment covered in 
   blood and then it disappears when two cops come knocking on his door. 
   The two cops actually arrive at his door to tell him that Carmen has 
   been murdered and it is in the same place he and Franklin saved her 
   months before. Carmen's throat has been cut and an inverted pentagram 
   carved into her stomach. Tess arrives at the police station and will 
   only talk to Logan. She tells him that she is a professional psychic 
   who has helped many police departments find missing children, but a 
   disbelieving Logan tells her that this has nothing to do with missing 
   children and blows her off. Tess tries to tell Logan that Channing is 
   back and his evil soul is on the loose thanks to Satan. He can jump 
   from body to body (the weaker the person's will, the easier it is for 
   Channing to take over the body), but he can disguise his appearance 
   to look like himself. She tells Logan that Channing is not just after 
   him, he is after her, too. They find the person that killed Carmen 
   and it is a skinny drunk drug abuser, the perfect kind of person for 
   Channing to take over. When Logan decides that this guy is too out of 
   it to kill anybody, he walks away, but he hears the guy say &quot;See 
   you later, buddy boy!&quot; in Channing's voice. No one else in the 
   room heard it. Logan and Franklin illegally break into Tess' lavish 
   home (Franklin says, &quot;Psychics must get paid well.&quot;, when 
   he sees the indoor pool) and Logan listens to the messages on her 
   answering machine. The third message is from Channing and he says 
   that he will be seeing them all soon. Tess catches them in her house 
   and when Logan goes to play the third message, there are only two on 
   the answering machine. Logan then accuses Tess of belonging to the 
   same occult cult as Channing, while Tess takes one look at Franklin 
   and tells him he is in mortal danger. The third message on the 
   answering machine told Logan where the next murder will be, so all 
   three of them head there, where Franklin is trampled to death by a 
   horse his dying words to Logan are, &quot;I saw him Russ. It was 
   him!&quot; Logan and Tess chase the horse-drawn carriage and Logan 
   watches in amazement as Channing jumps off a ten story building and 
   run away (One of the film's highlights, even though you can see the 
   rope harness). Logan's boss, Commander Perkins (Dennis Lipscomb; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Retribution1987">RETRIBUTION</A></B> 
   - 1987) finds Logan's story hard to swallow while hard-drinking Lt. 
   Grimes (Carmen Argenziano; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#HellraiserInferno">HELLRAISER:
    INFERNO</A></B> - 2000) makes fun of Logan's story and lets Tess go 
   home. When Mazza (Clayton Landey), another cop at Carmen's original 
   scene, is found murdered and hung like Jesus on the cross on the 
   underside of a high expansion bridge (One cop says, &quot;How'd they 
   get him up there?&quot;), Commander Perkins takes Logan off the case 
   and puts Lt. Grimes in charge. Logan goes to a church confessional to 
   ask about possession, only to discover that the priest he was talking 
   to was Channing in the other confessional room. Tess has a vision of 
   Logan in danger (he's supposed to get an axe in the head by Channing) 
   and she saves his life, but Channing chases them through the hallways 
   of a cheap motel with the spinning blades of a ceiling fan before 
   Channing jumps on the hood of a car that Logan and Tess have 
   commandeered and Logan must destroy the car to get Channing off it 
   (As a joke, Logan tells the car's owner to contact Lt. Grimes 
   directly for reimbursement). Logan now believes Tess, even if they 
   don't see eye-to-eye on all the details. That will change soon. They 
   go to talk to Sister Marguerite at the convent, but she refuses to 
   talk to them. They then go to Channing's grandmother (Julianna 
   McCarthy), where they inadvertantly learn that Channing&nbsp; was a 
   product of incest, his mother having sex and getting pregnant by his 
   grandfather (Satan must love incest!). Logan and Tess find Channing's 
   &quot;special place&quot; since he was a child: an abandoned and 
   unsafe section of the underground water system where a reservoir 
   worker (Grand L. Bush) tells them that the water will still flood the 
   tunnel if you spin the handle. Tess suddenly gets two bloody 
   pentagrams on her palms. Channing chases Logan and Tess to a highrise 
   construction site, where Tess knocks Channing off the building and he 
   is impaled on a metal pole below. When they get to the bottom, they 
   discover that the body is actually Lt. Grimes' (he was a hard 
   drinker, therefore easy to possess). Commander Perkins is slightly 
   more than agitated, but he gives Logan one more chance to solve the 
   murders (Really? You would let a prime suspect take over the case? 
   Are we sure this is the United States?). Sister Marguerite suddenly 
   gets a conscience and leaves the convent to help Tess and Logan (If 
   you haven't guessed by now, they have also become lovers.). Logan and 
   Tess are attacked once again by Channing, who this time takes over a 
   bag lady's body. It leads to Logan flipping his car on the highway 
   (Clearly, the film's best scene), with both Tess and Channing 
   disappearing from the wrecked car. A bloody Logan meets Sister 
   Marguerite, who gives Logan the only tool that can defeat Channing 
   and his body-hopping abilities: An ancient crucifix with a hidden 
   blade. She also explains the three evil powers that Channing 
   possesses: <B>3)</B> The ability to take over other people's bodies 
   (well, duh!). <B>2)</B> The gift of knowing the future and <B>1)</B> 
   Resurrection and immortality (The First Power). The ancient bladed 
   crucifix should be able to stop all three. Logan and Sister 
   Marguerite go to Channing's &quot;special place&quot; in the water 
   tunnels where Logan knows Channing is with Tess, but after killing 
   the bag lady and saving Tess' life, Channing jumps into Sister 
   Marguerite's body (I wonder what her weakness was? Not listening to 
   men?). The ridiculous ending finds Tess turning the wheel and 
   flooding the tunnels as all three of them go on their own private 
   amusement park water flume ride, where they all end up on a metal 
   grate with a pool of acid<A HREF="first_power_1990.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/first power dvd8 front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   below (Say what now?). Tess manages to toss Channing into the acid, 
   but she learns that it takes more than acid to kill him. Logan finds 
   the ancient crucifix knife (After that long water ride, it ends up 
   right next to him! What are the chances of that actually happening?) 
   and goes to stab Channing in the heart with it, but he is shot twice 
   by two officers at the scene. Logan still manages to plunge the 
   ancient dagger into Channing, ending the evil satanic menace and we 
   see Tess sitting by Logan's hospital bed as he recovers from his 
   wounds. But was he weak enough to have Channing's evil soul travel 
   into his body when he killed Channing (remember, he was already shot 
   and weak when he stabbed Channing)? The film ends and I got into my 
   car wondering what in the hell I just watched. I still was wondering 
   that after watching the Blu-Ray. The film is weak except for a few 
   good stunt sequences and the story is cookie-cutter stuff. There's 
   nothing here that screams, &quot;Look at me! I'm special!&quot; 
   Everyone walks through their roles, especially Lou Diamond Phillips, 
   who doesn't go out of his way to act any way special except for the 
   basic stuff. He comes off as flat and disinterested in the story, 
   just like the audiences must have felt when the theaters took their 
   hard-earned money to watch this film. I'm not saying that it is 
   awful, because it isn't. It's just one of those films that could have 
   worked better as a DTV VHS during the time period, than as a 
   theatrical film. Some of the decisions made by the characters will 
   make you shake your head until you get whiplash, but it was the only 
   way to advance the plot. That is a sign of sloppy screenwriting and 
   Robert Resnikoff takes full blame for this since the story was solely 
   his baby (It could also be the reason he left filmmaking). It should 
   be noted that Stewart Copeland, the drummer for The Police, composed 
   the film's musical score and Ed French did the very few special 
   makeup effects, which are really the only positive things throughout 
   the film. This is the kind of film that when you see a person 
   standing in front of an empty window, you just know someone is going 
   to come crashing through it. I'm a big fan of Jeff Kober and even 
   though this is one of his biggest roles, he has done much better in 
   shorter ones. If you don't have the original MGM DVD (which is really 
   all you need for this film), you can always purchase this film on DVD 
   &amp; Blu-Ray from <A HREF="http://www.kinolorber.com">Kino Lorber</A>/<A HREF="http://www.scorpionreleasing.com">Scorpion

   in this film, died the following year of cancer. He managed to star

    The film opens with the teenager Isabel (Justine Gall; <B><A HREF="naked_massacre_1976.htm">NAKED

   debauchery inside. Marie Chaney (Edwige Fenech; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CaseOfTheBloodyIris">THE
    CASE OF THE BLOODY IRIS</A></B> - 1971) is dancing to some groovy 
   music at a small party of people, removing her clothes in an

   island, has the houseboy, Charles (Mauro Bosco), hand out daggers to 
   his guests and then says that they are going to sacrifice a virgin to 
   the god Kraa (WTF?!?). The lights go out and when they come back on, 
   Marie is lying on the floor, covered in blood with a dagger in her 
   stomach. Trudy Farrell (Ira von F&uuml;rstenberg; <B><A HREF="fifth_cord_1971.htm">THE

    Industrialists Nick Chaney (Maurice Poli; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#UrbanWarriors">URBAN

   Ross; <B><A HREF="#WerewolfWoman1976">WEREWOLF WOMAN</A></B> - 1976), 
   along with George, beg Gerry to sell them an interest in his

   them no, for once he is not interested in making money, he is going 
   to give his invention away at a conference in Geneva next month. For 
   some reason, George has sent his yacht away, trapping everyone on the 
   island. Marie is cheating on her husband with housebay Charles, but 
   when she finds Charles dead, a dagger protruding out of his ribcage, 
   she goes running to Nick to tell him what has happened. Even though 
   they have an &quot;open&quot; marriage (Do they even work???), Nick 
   calls her a &quot;dirty whore&quot; and accuses her of murder (Marie 
   takes a shower she he can now call her a &quot;clean whore&quot;!). 
   Marie says she is innocent. Is she? Is Charles faking like Marie did 
   the night before? Apparently not, as they decide to hang Charles' 
   body in the house's walk-in freezer.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then find out that Nick is cheating on his wife with Trudy and

    HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE</A></B> - 1969), Jack's wife (This is 
   getting very confusing!). It's a regular Peyton Place with this group 
   and it comes as no surprise that all this infidelity and individual 
   secrets everyone holds would lead to murder. But why does Isabel hide 
   Marie's flowing white cape under some rocks at the beach? And who is 
   George's wife, Jill (Edith Meloni), looking at through the scope of a 
   rifle? A shot rings out and Gerry is found dead on the beach by Jill. 
   Jill drags his body into the ocean and doesn't try to cover her 
   footprints in the sand, so when everyone else comes running to the 
   beach, her footprints are clearly visible. What is she up to? (Now 
   there are two bodies hanging in the freezer).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Earlier, Nick tried to sway Gerry and stab George and Jack in the 
   back (not literally) by handing him a million dollar cashiers check, 
   but when Gerry is discovered dead, he tries to get the check back, it 
   is missing. Who took it? (A cashiers check is as good as cash). The 
   next one to die is Jill. Nick finds her outside his bedroom, on the 
   porch, a bullet in her head (Yes, they were sleeping together!). Now 
   there are three bodies in the freezer. Marie is then found dead, her 
   body pinned to a tree by a large knife in her chest (four bodies in 
   the freezer). The next death is Peggy. She is found dead in an 
   oversize bathtub, &quot;Forgive me. I can't go on&quot; written in 
   lipstick on a mirror. Did she commit suicide or was it murder? (Five 
   bodies in the freezer).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Trudy records an account of what is going on in the house on a 
   reel-to-reel tape recorder, but forgets to turn it off. Then George 
   and everyone else are drugged (it was in the champagne) and they all 
   fall to sleep (or do they?). The Coast Guard then show up on the 
   island, but when they search the house, no one is there. Thinking 
   that they must have found another way of getting off the island, the 
   Coast Guard leave the island (without searching the freezer???). We 
   then watch as Trudy, George<A HREF="5_dolls_for_an_august_moon_1970_foreign_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/5 dolls for an august moon italy poster10 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="193" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>&nbsp;
    and Jack waking up from their drugged slumber in the house's living 
   room. Trudy finds one of the reels of the tape recorder spinning and 
   plays it back, where they discover that the Coast Guard were there. 
   Why didn't they see them? Did someone move their bodies and hide 
   them, only to place them in the living room when the Coast Guard 
   left? Oh, and Nick's dead body is found hanging in the freezer. Who 
   is responsible for all this? If you are a fan of Christie's &quot;Ten 
   Little Indians&quot;, it's not hard to figure out that one dead 
   person is not dead and was working in conjunction with one of the 
   living. Will the killer(s) get away with it or will proper justice be 
   meted out?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    It's easy to see that Mario Bava was coasting here, but a coasting 
   Bava is still better than most directors who try their hardest. While 
   Bava was not a cinematographer on this film, it still contains his 
   sense of visual flair and atmosphere, especially the sequence&nbsp; 
   where George and Jack get into a fight and knock over a bowl of glass 
   marbles. We follow the marbles like a wave of water, as they travel 
   down the stairs&nbsp; and into the tub containing Trudy's body. Very 
   effective, as is the sight of all the dead bodies in the freezer, 
   swaying in unison like some bizarre dance. Very creepy. The film, 
   originally titled <B><A HREF="5_dolls_for_an_august_moon_1970_foreign_ads.htm">5
    BAMBOLE PER LA LUNA D'AGOSTO</A></B> (a literal translation of the 
   review title), moves at a brisk pace (it is only 81 minutes long) 
   and, unlike <B><A HREF="bay_of_blood_1971.htm">A BAY OF BLOOD</A></B>,
    both the nudity and violence are fairly restrained. Sure, who 
   wouldn't want to see the beautiful Edwige Fenech naked? But it's not 
   that kind of film. Filled with late-'60s fashions, music (a catchy 
   score by Piero Umiliani; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BlackCobra1976">BLACK
    COBRA WOMAN</A></B> - 1976) and interior decor, this film is about 
   the idle rich wanting to become richer and doing everything in their 
   power to achieve that goal, even if it means sleeping with their 
   opponents' wife or husband. This film was reviled by critics&nbsp; 
   and Bava fans when it was originally released but, like most of 
   Bava's films, it has gained a cult following, and rightfully so. This 
   may not be essential Bava, but it's a nice diversion.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Never released theatrically or on VHS in the United States, it was 
   originally released on DVD from Image Entertainment early in the New 
   Millennium. It says it is uncut, but it is actually missing more than 
   three minutes of footage. The one you want is the DVD or Blu-Ray 
   released by <A HREF="http://www.kinolorber.com">Kino Lorber</A>. It 
   is uncut and in its original OAR and it looks fantastic. Bava bathes 
   the film in primary colors and the image is crisp and clean. While it

   fact, it is probably better than 90% of the shot-on-video shit that

    couples in Chicago. Two distraught cops try to search for clues to 
   the killer&#146;s identity while trying to avoid a nosey female 
   reporter who is not fond of the police. The cops are able to trace 
   the killer&#146;s tracks back 20 years. It seems that every five 
   years he kills five couples in five days (hence the title) and then 
   disappears. Since four couples have been killed this time, time is 
   running out. The cops unmask the killer after the reporter supplies 
   them with some vital information on someone she used to date. This is 
   by no means a good film, but it does have some positive points. It is 
   decently acted, something you usually don&#146;t find in a film of 
   this type. The effects aren&#146;t halfway bad either. There&#146;s a 
   decapitation, a throat slashing, a knife shoved clear through a neck 
   and various sharp blade mayhem. Just remember that we&#146;re talking 
   about a home movie budget here, so don&#146;t expect anything on par 
   with shot-on-film movies. Director Wally Koz tries really hard to get 
   the most out of his meager budget and he generally succeeds. It may 
   have helped that the entire Koz family worked both behind and in 
   front of the camera. With more money and a 16mm camera, he may be 
   able to make something that I could praise. Until then, he&#146;ll

    Giorgio Pisani (Francis Matthews; <B><A HREF="dracula_prince_of_darkness_1966.htm">DRACULA:
    PRINCE OF DARKNESS</A></B> - 1966) is a journalist and author who 
   has just returned home after a lengthy assignment overseas. At the 
   airport, he phones his pregnant wife Erica and discovers that she is 
   in labor. He races home after grabbing a doctor when Erica tells him 
   that her regular physician, Dr. Lidia Franzi (Pascale Rivault; <B><A HREF="beast_1975.htm">THE
    BEAST</A></B> - 1975), is not with her and cannot be reached. When 
   Giorgio and the doctor arrive home, Giorgio hears a baby crying and 
   sees Lidia descending the stairs, a look of sorrow on her face. Erica 
   has died during childbirth, the premature baby boy is then rushed to 
   the intensive care unit at the clinic Lidia works at and put in an 
   incubator. Giorgio is heartbroken at his wife's funeral, where we 
   learn that Erica's brother, Fabrizio (Alessandro Quasimodo), who is 
   married to Lidia, is a real bastard who only cares about himself. 
   Fabrizio is looking for an envelope Erica was supposed to give to 
   Lidia, but she died before she could hand it over. Whatever is in 
   that envelope, Fabrizio is willing to do anything to get his hands on 
   it. Does that include murder? Giorgio then gets some distressing news 
   while waiting for Lidia in her office. On her desk is a folder with 
   Giorgio's name written on it in big black letters. Inside the folder 
   is a medical document that states Giorgio is sterile. When Lidia 
   enters the office, Giorgio wants to know why he was never told he was 
   sterile. Lidia tells him she knows he is sexually virile and 
   handsome, but Erica didn't want him to be told he was unable to have 
   children. It then dawns on Giorgio that if he is sterile, then how 
   did his wife get pregnant? Lidia tells him not to think about it; he 
   knew his wife was desperate to have a baby, but Giorgio can't help 
   wondering who the baby's father is. When Giorgio leaves the office, 
   Lidia calls in her nurse and asks why she put Giorgio's medical 
   folder on her desk. The nurse tells her she didn't, she put the 
   folder in the filing cabinet, just like she does with all the medical 
   folders. It is apparent the folder was purposely put on Lidia's desk 
   so Giorgio would read it, but who is responsible?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While Giorgio is walking towards the clinic, he sees foreign tourist 
   Tiffany (future porn star Ilona Staller; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#ManiacResponsible">THE
    MANIAC RESPONSIBLE</A></B> - 1975; a.k.a. &quot;Cicciolina&quot;, 
   here using the name &quot;Elena Mercuri&quot;) nearly get hit by a 
   car, so he goes to her to see if she is hurt. She's not, but she asks 
   him to drive her home. At her place, Tiffany strips naked and wants 
   to make love to Giorgio because she just learned that she is 
   pregnant. Giorgio seemingly refuses her advances (it's not made 
   clear), but, later, we see someone wearing gloves (which aren't black 
   for a change, but tan driving gloves) slicing a naked Tiffany from 
   vagina to stomach with what looks like a box cutter in some sort of 
   perverted and deadly abortion. The killer also slices and mutilates 
   Tiffany's left breast, carving a strange symbol on it (a symbol of 
   fertility) as their &quot;calling card&quot;. An unnamed Police 
   Commissioner (Howard Ross; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#FiveDolls1970">FIVE
    DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON</A></B> - 1970, who is credited on some 
   advertising materials under his real name, &quot;Renato Rossini&quot;)
    and his harried assistant, Palumbo (Ugo Bombognini; <B><A HREF="44_specialist_1976.htm">THE
    .44 SPECIALIST</A></B> - 1976), are assigned to the case, not 
   realizing that this is just the first of several graphic murders of 
   pregnant women that will happen in the days to come and their only 
   common link to all the crime scenes is Giorgio, whom we hope is not 
   killing all these women because of his dead wife. But that would be 
   too easy, wouldn't it? Let's hope so.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Giorgio's newspaper editor (cameo king Tom Felleghy; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DamnedInVenice1978">DAMNED
    IN VENICE</A></B> - 1978) wants to send him on an assignment to 
   Cambodia, but Giorgio says he cannot go, he has a baby to take care 
   of now and recommends he send female reporter Oriana (Catherine 
   Diamant). The editor pulls Oriana into his office and tells her about 
   the new assignment, but she declines to go, telling him that she 
   found out this morning that she is pregnant. Uh, oh! Fabrizio, who 
   was standing outside the editor's office for reasons not yet made 
   clear, also hears the news. That night, while Oriana is driving home, 
   she gets the feeling that she is being followed, so she rushes to her 
   apartment and bolts the door. It is then revealed that the gloved 
   killer was already in her apartment, so the killer strips Oriana 
   naked and slices her from labia to navel with a sharp blade. This is 
   the second brutal murder where the only common link is Giorgio and it 
   doesn't go unnoticed by the Commissioner, who questions Giorgio. he 
   seems to have valid answers to all the questions the Commissioner 
   asks him (yet he lies about knowing Tiffany and being in her 
   apartment), but he is still the number one suspect to the 
   Commissioner. Maybe he and Palumbo should dig a little deeper for 
   other common links. Giorgio can't get over that his wife had sex with 
   another man, yet he treats the baby as if it his own.&nbsp; Deep down 
   inside, Giorgio lizes that his wife was willing to have sex with 
   another man just to get pregnant, because she really wanted a baby so 
   they could start a family. Giorgio wants to know who that man is, if 
   only to see if he had anything to do with the murders.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Sofia (Gabriella Lepori; <B><A HREF="action.htm#RomeArmedTeeth">ROME:
    ARMED TO THE TEETH</A></B> - 1976) making love to the married 
   Professor Aldo Betti (Giorgio Albertazzi; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#FatalFrames1996">FATAL
    FRAMES</A></B> - 1996), a doctor at the clinic (Sofia is a nurse at 
   the clinic). She asks him when he is going to leave his wife and Aldo 
   tells Sofia that his wife knows all about his dalliances with other 
   women and she just doesn't care, but since she is a &quot;good 
   Catholic&quot;, she will never give him a divorce. Aldo also tells 
   Sofia that all women are alike, all they want to do is get pregnant 
   so they can be called &quot;mommy&quot; (remember this was the 
   early-'70s; it's nothing like it is today!). Sofia says to him, 
   &quot;I'm not sure how much this will interest you, perhaps you don't 
   care...but I'm already pregnant. Aldo gives her a surprised look, but 
   I think we know how this will all turn out: rather badly. Fabrizio, 
   who is also having an affair with Sofia, accuses her of caring more 
   about Aldo than him, but Sofia says she loves him and Aldo is nothing 
   but a meaningless fling. She then makes love to Fabrizio.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The Medical Examiner (Franco Moraldi; <B><A HREF="#DeathWalksMidnite72">DEATH
    WALKS AT MIDNIGHT</A></B> - 1972) tells the Commissioner that the 
   same set of fingerprints were found at both crime scenes (Which is 
   weird because the killer wears gloves and doesn't take them off. It's 
   also a major clue.). The Commissioner is sure that Giorgio was lying 
   when he said he never met Tiffany, as the fingerprints are his. Just 
   to be safe, he is willing to give Giorgio the benefit of the doubt, 
   saying further evidence is needed before accusing Giorgio of two 
   murders. Giorgio tells Lidia everything, holding nothing back, and 
   she tells him not to worry because he is innocent. Lidia wants to 
   know why Fabrizio was at the newspaper and Giorgio tells her Fabrizio 
   was trying to sell one of his stupid ideas to his editor; another one 
   of those scandal columns that was prevalent in newspapers <A HREF="5_women_for_the_killer_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/5 women for the killer italy poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="209" HEIGHT="306" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>during
    that time, but the editor refused and Fabrizio said he would take 
   his idea to another newspaper. It seems that Fabrizio did just that, 
   as another newspaper agreed to his scandal column and the person he 
   turned his attention (and ire) to was Aldo, who is extremely rich, 
   thanks to his wife. After complaining about the column to his wife, 
   Aldo gets a phone call from Sofia, who wants to see him right away. 
   His wife tells Aldo to do three things: <B>1)</B> Find out if Sofia 
   is really pregnant (Aldo says he already has, as he talked to Lidia, 
   Sofia's gynecologist, who said yes, Sofia is pregnant). <B>2)</B> Get 
   some new clothes because he looks ridiculous (Aldo tells her if they 
   were good enough for his grandfather, then they are good enough for 
   him!), and <B>3)</B> Be careful. She says to Aldo, &quot;I've given 
   up everything, even having children, but I'm not prepared to lose my 
   dignity.&quot; Aldo asks her to explain herself and she says, &quot;If
    she causes a scandal and it's in all the papers, I won't be on your 
   side!&quot; (Aldo calls her a &quot;bitch&quot; under his breath). 
   She may be a good Catholic, but she has her limits.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The Commissioner and Palumbo arrive at Giorgio's house unannounced, 
   the Commissioner lying to housekeeper Aunt Marta (Maria Cumani 
   Quasimodo; <B><A HREF="#AllColorsDark1972">ALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK</A></B> 
   - 1972), telling her that he and Giorgio are good friends. When she 
   discovers who he really is, she throws a fit, but Giorgio tells her 
   to calm down by saying they might not be friends, but they are also 
   not enemies (Giorgio is nothing if not diplomatic). The Commissioner 
   meets the beautiful Alba Galli (Katia Christine; <B><A HREF="#DesignatedVictim71">THE
    DESIGNATED VICTIM</A></B> - 1971), whom Giorgio hired to act as a 
   nanny to his baby son, who is home from the clinic.The Commissioner 
   only has one question to ask Giorgio and that is where Aunt Marta 
   resides. When Giorgio tells him she lives in an apartment above the 
   garage, the Commissioner excuses himself and he and Palumbo exit the 
   house. Curious, no?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Aldo fails to meet Sofia, she calls his home and talks to his 
   wife, who tells her, &quot;He didn't come? I don't know, try the 
   clinic. Do what you like! Jump off a cliff!&quot;, then hangs up the 
   phone. Sofia then gets in her car and drives away, unaware that 
   Giorgio is watching her out a shop window across the street. When 
   Sofia arrives home, she phones Fabrizio, but he's not there. She runs 
   the water to take a bath and undresses, when her phone rings. Sofia 
   picks it up, thinking it is Aldo, but we can see it is the gloved 
   killer, calling her from a phone booth across the street from her 
   home. The killer says nothing and hangs up the phone. As Sofia is 
   about to take a relaxing soak in the bathtub, the killer strikes, 
   slashing Sofia across her chest and then slicing her open from 
   clitoris to bellybutton. When The Commissioner arrives at the crime 
   scene and says this is the third pregnant woman murdered, the Medical 
   Examiner informs him that Sofia wasn't pregnant. He says the killer's 
   technique was like the others, but he is sure it isn't the same 
   killer, telling the Commissioner, &quot;It's a variation on a theme. 
   Good luck, Commissioner!&quot; So was Sofia murdered for another 
   reason, making it look like the other killings? Damn right it was! 
   But who killed her? The Commissioner and Palumbo question Aldo and he 
   tells them that Sofia was a nurse at his clinic, but he fails to tell 
   them&nbsp; he was having an affair with her. When the Commissioner 
   asks him where he was at the time of Sofia's murdewr, he uses that 
   old chestnut, that his profession protects the confidentiality 
   between him and his patients and he refuses to break it. When the 
   Commissioner and Palumbo leave, Aldo phones Lidia and tells her to 
   come to his office immediately to have her back up his alibi should 
   the Commissioner question her. What Aldo doesn't know is the 
   Commissioner is talking to Pellegrini (Lorenzo Piani; <B><A HREF="riot_in_a_womens_prison_1974.htm">RIOT
    IN A WOMEN'S PRISON</A></B> - 1974), Aldo's chauffeur and part-time 
   clinic worker, whom the Commissioner once arrested for being a pimp, 
   which he failed to tell Aldo. The Commissioner then questions Lidia, 
   telling her he knows Aldo was having an affair with Sofia, but that 
   is not important. Lidia tells him that Aldo asked her to visit Sofia 
   yesterday morning for an examination to see if she was pregnant. It 
   turns out Lidia didn't visit Sofia, saying Sofia wasn't stupid and 
   would know it was a setup orchestrated by Aldo. Lidia pretended she 
   did visit Sofia and then phoned Aldo to say that Sofia was pregnant, 
   which was a lie. This bit of information only makes Aldo look 
   guiltier, something Aldo is aware of, as we see him talking to Lidia, 
   telling her that only he and her knew Sofia was pregnant (He still 
   doesn't know that Lidia lied to him). But Lidia tells him one other 
   person also knew... his wife, whom the Commissioner and Palumbo are 
   now questioning, when Aldo walks in and says he needs to talk o the 
   Commissioner in private, telling his wife to leave the room. Aldo 
   tells the Commissioner that he and Sofia weren't madly in love, 
   &quot;It was just a bit of fun, a distraction.&quot; The Commissioner 
   asks Aldo if he had a key to Sofia's apartment and Aldo says he never 
   had a key. When the Commissioner and Palumbo leave abruptly 
   (something they do quite often in this film), Aldo's wife says the 
   key is an important clue. Aldo then goes to the Commissioner's office 
   to tell him everything when the Commissioner tells him the killer 
   must have had a key to Sofia's&nbsp; apartment, since she was 
   completely naked and about to take a bath and wouldn't answer the 
   front door nude if anyone knocked on it. Aldo tells the Commissioner 
   about Sofia's phone call to meet her, but he was late showing up 
   because he had to see a friend's son who live outside the city, 
   saying he was there until 7:00pm, long after Sofia was murdered. He 
   then says that he drove back to meet Sophia at the agreed place, but 
   the car broke down, so he called Pellegrini to come pick him up (not 
   knowing that the Commissioner already talked to Pellegrini). When the 
   Commissioner tells Aldo that Pelligrini was once a pimp, all Aldo can 
   think about is how the Press will run with this story and ruin his reputation</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Fabrizio tells Giorgio that Aldo's wife was once locked up in an 
   asylum for attempted murder. When she was 15-years-old, she tried to 
   kill her entire family by putting rat poison in their dinner, but she 
   didn't use enough and nobody died. She was locked up for a few years, 
   then released. Why is Fabrizio telling this to Giorgio, who couldn't 
   give a shit? Fabrizio looks at Alba pushing a baby carriage and says 
   that she's his kind of woman. He then callously says at least his 
   wife is still alive, even though she is cold as ice. He the looks at 
   the baby and says, &quot;He looks like no one!&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Okay, as you can probably guess, there are two killers on the loose. 
   I've given you all the clues you need to figure out who the killers 
   are. Still need to know more? I will tell you this: The Commissioner 
   pulls Pellegrini into his office and discovers he was very, very 
   close to Sofia. He even came up with the idea of Sofia being 
   pregnant, so they could blackmail Aldo for a lot of money. Pellegrini 
   also tells the Commissioner that Sofia was incapable of having 
   children, because she told him when they first met that she had 
   something hereditary, something inside her, a condition he can't 
   remember the name of, but the clinic was aware of it. But who in the 
   clinic knew about it? It certainly wasn't Aldo.&nbsp; Lidia phones 
   Giorgio and tells him to come to the clinic, she has&nbsp; something 
   important to tell him, also saying that she is frightened and 
   believes she is being watched. Giorgio tells Alba and Aunt Marta that 
   he is going to the clinic and when he arrives, he hears Lidia 
   screaming. He rushes into the clinic and discovers that it is dark 
   and no lights are on. He hears Lidia quietly calling out his name, 
   telling him the light switch is next to the front door. When he turns 
   the lights on, he finds a naked Lidia cowering in a corner and she 
   tells him......That's enough. It's time for you to put your thinking 
   cap on and start doing some deducing.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This is a damn fine mystery which doesn't cheat the audience with a 
   final reveal that comes out of left field. It's quite the opposite, 
   actually, as screenwriters Gianfranco Clerici (<B><A HREF="#HouseEdgePark1979">THE
    HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK</A></B> - 1979), Vincenzo<A HREF="5_women_for_the_killer_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/5 women for the killer aka day-killer germany vhs front &amp; back2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="189" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Mannino (<B><A HREF="#KillerOnPhone1972">THE KILLER IS ON THE PHONE</A></B> 
   - 1972) and Roberto Gianviti (<B><A HREF="#DontTortureDuck72">DON'T 
   TORTURE A DUCKLING</A></B> - 1972) have crafted a finely-tuned 
   mystery that's quite hard to solve, but all the clues are there if 
   you watch the film a second time, which is what I did (Clerici and 
   Mannino also wrote the screenplay to Lucio Fulci's mean-spirited <B><A HREF="new_york_ripper_1982b.htm">THE
    NEW YORK RIPPER</A></B> [1982], borrowing a few pages from this 
   film). When Alba tells Giorgio that she is pregnant and the baby is 
   his, not knowing he is sterile, you will start thinking that his 
   sterility is a fabrication, because Alba doesn't seem like a woman 
   who would lie. I love films that play with your expectations and this 
   film plays with them expertly. You will not know what to believe. The 
   final fifteen minutes of this film rivals anything by Dario Argento 
   or Sergio Martino, as the killer (at least one of them) chases Alba 
   and the baby with an axe through the house until Giorgio arrives and 
   unmasks the killer. The Commissioner then arrives and reveals the 
   identity of the second killer, the final line of dialogue in the film 
   being, &quot;You filthy whore!&quot; The <A HREF="5_women_for_the_killer_1974.htm#OST">freeform

    OF THE DEVILS</A></B> - 1972), also injects some class into the 
   proceedings. I kept finding myself digging the music and almost 
   ignoring the plot, it's that good. It's one of the best giallo 
   soundtracks I have heard in a long, long time, but the biggest 
   surprise is the solid direction by Stelvio Massi. I found most of the 
   films he directed to be exploitative, but bland and uneventful 
   (granted, I haven't seen many), but this film changed my opinion 
   about him greatly. This film is filled with little camera tricks, 
   such as when we see the Commissioner talking to the Medical Examiner 
   through a set of magnified fingerprints hanging on a lightbox. Little 
   things like that go unnoticed by most people, but not by me. It shows 
   me that some thought and care was put into making this film. So you 
   can now consider me a fan of Stelvio Massi and I look forward to 
   reviewing more of his films in the near future.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   their separate ways. Dr. Valenti drives home, noticing a familiar car 
   parked in his lot. When he walks into his house, he sees that one of 
   his lovers is still there (Even though we never see the woman's face, 
   we can't help but believe that it is Daniela. Once you watch this

   but she says nothing, which just pisses him off. He starts screaming 
   at her, but she still says nothing, so Adrian gives her a shove and 
   walks away. Realizing that he may have been too rough on her, he 
   apologizes, but she still says nothing. He then finds out why. When 
   he gave her a shove, she fell to the floor, knocking over a heavy 
   metal sculpture of a flower, one of its sharp metal petals impaling 
   her body, killing her. Adrian doesn't know what to do, so he turns 
   out the lights and looks out his window to make sure no one saw what 
   he did. He then comes up with a plan to dispose of his lover's body. 
   He drags her to the bathroom and places her naked body in the 
   bathtub, where he cuts her body into pieces, using scalpels and a 
   bone saw (we see him cutting up the body in quick flashes, some of 
   them purposely out of focus), placing the pieces (and his bloody 
   clothes) in plastic bags and a suitcase (When he realizes what he has 
   just done, seeing all the blood and viscera in the bathtub, he pukes 
   into his toilet!). He then puts the plastic bags and suitcase in the 
   trunk of his car, driving to a building with a rather large grinder. 
   He then turns on the grinder, tosses the plastic bags and suitcase 
   into it and watches as the grinder turns everything into dust, 
   obliterating all the evidence into nothingness.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next morning, Adrian is awakened by his doorbell. It's Evelyne 
   and she demands to see Daniela, Adrian telling her that she is not 
   here. She looks around his home, stopping to take a long look at the 
   flower sculpture and then asks him where Daniela went. Adrian is 
   adamant, telling Evelyne that he hasn't seen her sister in quite a 
   while. &quot;So why is her car here?&quot; asks Evelyne and by the 
   look on Adrian's face, you can see the guilt, but he asks Evelyne if 
   she is sure it is her sister's car. &quot;Look for a better excuse, 
   Adrian. You're going to need it.&quot;, replies Evelyne, as she walks 
   out the door, adding, &quot;You better pray nothing has happened to 
   her!&quot; Adrian then goes to the hospital and does his daily 
   rounds, acting as if nothing has happened. Nurse Lena (Pilar 
   Vel&aacute;zquez; <B><A HREF="#NakedGirlPark1972">NAKED GIRL KILLED 
   IN THE PARK</A></B> - 1972), another one of Adrian's lovers, tells 
   him that she tried to call last night, but he tells her he 
   disconnected the phone because he didn't want to be disturbed. When 
   Adrian goes to his office, Police Inspector Garrano (Ivano Staccioli; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Devil7Faces1971">THE
    DEVIL WITH SEVEN FACES</A></B> - 1971) is there, wanting to have a 
   short talk with him. He tells the doctor that Evelyne contacted him 
   to report her sister missing, so it is his duty to investigate, 
   apologizing to the doctor for taking up his valuable time. It seems 
   Evelyne told the Inspector about Daniela's sexual relationship with 
   Adrian and the Inspector asks him if the relationship was serious, 
   Adrian saying no, it was just a fling (Telling the Inspector, 
   &quot;Not important, I would say.&quot;). We then discover that 
   Daniela is Evelyne's stepsister, Adrian telling the Inspector that 
   Evelyne and Daniela haven't been getting along as of late, diverting 
   suspicion to Evelyne, but when the Inspector leaves his office, he 
   asks Adrian why Daniela's car is parked by his house. Adrian says he 
   doesn't know, the Inspector telling him not to worry, he'll get to 
   the bottom of it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Adrian gets home, he finds Evelyne in his house waiting for 
   him. He asks her how she got in and she shows him the key, saying her 
   sister gave it to her. She once again demands to know where Daniela 
   is and Adrian says that this has nothing to do with her sister, she 
   is jealous, as they were once lovers, too. Evelyne tries to slap 
   Adrian, but he grabs her arm, almost breaking it and throws he onto 
   his bed. He then sees some strange footprints on his rug that come 
   from his bathroom and lead outside his living room's double glass 
   doors to his backyard. He then kisses Evelyne and she kisses him 
   back. He tells her that if she wants a relationship with him, she 
   will have to drop the investigation. Evelyne walks out of the house 
   in a huff and Adrian follows the footprints outside. They seemingly 
   lead to a window across an alleyway that looks directly into his 
   house. Could whoever was at that window have seen Adrian kill Daniela?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Adrian is about to go to work, the Inspector shows up and tells 
   him there is something important he needs to know, but he must come 
   to his office. When Adrian gets there, Evelyne is also in the office. 
   The Inspector asks him about the phone call he made to Daniela the 
   day she disappeared and what the phone call was about. Adrian tells 
   him it was nothing important, but Evelyne interrupts and says that 
   isn't so, she overheard the phone call and it was quite contentious. 
   Adrian was cursing at her and then he invited her to his house. When 
   the Inspector mentions the word &quot;murder&quot;, Adrian goes on 
   the defensive, telling the Inspector that he feels he is being 
   illegally detained, saying his lawyer should be present, as he storms 
   out of the Inspector's office. He couldn't look more guilty if he tried.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Evelyne enter the building across the alleyway from 
   Adrian's house, by ringing a buzzer. We then see Adrian sneaking into 
   the very same building. It doesn't take a genius to know why Adrian 
   is there, but why is Evelyne there? Adrian discovers nothing about 
   the window, except it is in a room full of creepy broken dolls (it is 
   quite the sight!). When Adrian gets home, Lena is waiting for him, 
   wondering why he hasn't reconnected his phone, because she has been 
   calling him for days. They then make love and when Adrian is done, 
   his doorbell rings. It's a neighbor, who has a package for him. When 
   Adrian asks her who it is from, she says she doesn't know, it was a 
   young man who handed her the package. Adrian then opens the package 
   and inside it is a wooden box. Inside the box is a single metal 
   petal, the same exact kind found on his sculpture. His phone then 
   rings. It is a man, who says, &quot;Do you think you got rid of 
   me?&quot; Adrian asks who this is, the man replying, &quot;You know 
   me very well. I don't want to see you with anyone else&quot; and then 
   hangs up. Adrian hears something on the phone (it's a broken doll 
   saying &quot;Mama! Mama!&quot;) that makes him go back to the room 
   with the creepy dolls. When Adrian gets there, he finds Daniela's 
   corpse hanging on a wall, all her removed appendages crudely sewn 
   back on her body. How can this be when Adrian ground up her body into 
   bloody dust? The film then cleverly juxtaposes the image of a 
   rotating grinder turning into a child's merry-go-round in a park, 
   where we see Evelyne talking to the Inspector, telling him she is 
   sure Adrian killed her sister, saying ever since Daniela has been 
   seeing Adrian, &quot;he changed her&quot;. The Inspector tells her he 
   has no evidence to arrest Adrian, so Evelyne hands him a document, 
   telling him that Adrian is being protected by &quot;influential&quot; 
   people. The Inspector reads the document and by the look on his face, 
   this is all the evidence that he needs. Just what is in that document 
   to make him change his mind so fast?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Inspector then goes to an insane asylum, where he (and we) watch 
   all the patients act crazy, but he is only interested in one woman. A 
   psychiatrist (Umberto Raho; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#SoDarlingDeadly1966">SO
    DARLING, SO DEADLY</A></B> - 1966) tells him that this woman was 
   committed here after losing her virginity to her newlywed husband. 
   That husband would be Adrian and the woman is the daughter of a rich 
   deceased industrialist. It seems Adrian married her so he could then 
   have her committed, thereby making him the sole beneficiary of her 
   father's vast fortune (Nice guy, huh?). The doctor tells the 
   Inspector that his job is getting in the way and influencing his 
   opinion of Adrian and the Inspector shoots back, asking the 
   psychiatrist if he really believes that every patient committed to 
   this asylum is actually crazy (He makes a good point). The 
   psychiatrist says it is all moot anyway, as Adrian's wife has been 
   recently released and she is free. So where is Adrian's wife?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Adrian is at the hospital when Lena tells him he has a phone call, 
   but when he picks up the receiver, no one is there. We then see it 
   was Evelyne, as she puts down the phone and continues having dinner 
   with the Inspector at a restaurant. Are they in a relationship? 
   Adrian can't figure out how Daniela's body ended up in that room, his 
   memory taking him back to the grinder and Evelyne showing him 
   Daniela's key back at his house. Is there a connection between those 
   two memories? We then see Adrian pick up a briefcase full of cash at 
   a lawyer's office and when he leaves, the lawyer calls the Inspector. 
   We also see Lena and Evelyne in the backseat of a taxi. Are they 
   working together? OK, I have given you all the clues you need to 
   figure it out, so light your pipe, grab your magnifying glass and 
   start doing some detecting!</FONT></FONT><BR>

   actually had a U.S. theatrical release, as I have never heard of it

   to prove it (thanks <A HREF="http://www.templeofschlock.blogspot.com">Temple
    Of Schlock</A>!). This has a fairly involving mystery and some 
   shocking scenes (the sight of Daniela's stitched-together corpse 
   being one of them and the unbelievable underwater reveal during the 
   finale being another one). The film opens with a scuba diver swimming 
   at the bottom of the ocean and I wondered what that had to do with 
   the rest of the film, but it is answered, rather titillatingly, close 
   to the end of the film, where one character from the film removes 
   their wetsuit, swimming completely naked (nothing is left to the 
   imagination) with one of their lovers. I will say no more, because it 
   will ruin the finale. All I will say is, just when it looks like they 
   are going to get away with it, the police (and the Inspector) show up 
   to ruin their plans. Director/co-screenwriter Gianfranco Piccioli (<B><A HREF="hokey_pokey_gang_1976.htm">THE

   makes perfect sense, but you really have to WATCH the film to pick up 
   some of the finer nuances, otherwise you will be hopelessly lost. If 
   you like using your brain to enjoy a film, look no further than this

   U.S. Theatrical release, but I have no idea who distributed it (IMDb 
   doesn't list it as having a U.S theatrical release). This film never

   get a quick glimpse of Carroll Baker in the nude. Baker, who was no

   takes a shower early in this film, we do get a peek. Most of the 
   other actresses in this film go much further in the nudity

    Nancy's husband will be away for the weekend on a business trip, he 
   plans for a long weekend of rape and degradation, all at Nancy's 
   expense. But first, Carl gets beaten to a pulp by a pimp who 
   discovers him peeping on his hooker girlfriend in the Ladies Room at 
   the gas station. Carl works out his frustrations by raping and 
   killing a young woman who stops at the station to put some air in her 
   bicycle tire (Vaginal rape by beer bottle is explicitly implied, 
   followed by shots of a bloody wrench swinging up and down). Carl then 
   picks up a hitchhiker (a cameo by Nancy Allen; <B><A HREF="dressed_to_kill_1980.htm">DRESSED
    TO KILL</A></B> - 1980), ties her up, rapes her and then drops her 
   lifeless body in a field. He then goes to Nancy's house, where he 
   breaks in, ties Nancy up and slowly begins to systematically rape and 
   torture her. After slapping her around and forcing her to sleep with 
   him in the same bed she shares with her husband, Nancy tries to 
   escape while Carl is sleeping, but he recaptures her and then murders 
   a nosy delivery boy. Carl (who wears a &quot;Camp Weedawong&quot; tee 
   shirt during this sequence) is eventually killed by Nancy, who grabs 
   a butcher knife and repeatedly stabs him to death, just as her kids 
   are walking through the front door.&nbsp; Relentlessly repellant and 
   hard to watch, one begins to wonder why director Jim Sotos (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Sweet Sixteen 1982">SWEET
    SIXTEEN</A></B> - 1982; <B><A HREF="hot_moves_1985.htm">HOT MOVES</A></B> 
   - 1985) chose to remake an equally repellant porno film (the first 
   film directed by Shaun Costello, using the pseudonym &quot;Helmuth 
   Richler&quot;) as his first directorial effort. There's not much 
   point to this film except to show one man's total hatred and 
   disregard for the female of the species. Screenwriter Henry Scarpelli 
   (who co-produced this with Sotos) seems to imply that impotence leads 
   to murder, as Carl can't seem to close the deal (if you know what I 
   mean) with his rape victims, so he gets off degrading his victims, 
   usually by tying their hands behind their backs, screaming out 
   obscenities and penetrating their bodies with foreign objects before 
   killing them, all of which Sotos is glad to show us, usually in super 
   slow-motion. Carl also stutters when faced with talking to women 
   under normal circumstances and only loses the stutter when he has 
   complete control of his victims' lives. Since we are never given any 
   clear information on Carl's background (until the obviously tacked-on 
   ending), most of Carl's actions ring hollow and unnecessary, 
   especially all the hate-filled diatribes that we hear as Carl's 
   thoughts. There's nothing remotely enjoyable about this film because 
   it serves no other purpose than to show a sick man's hatred for 
   women. It doesn't have the same significance of other films like <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Bloodrage">BLOODRAGE:

   wife and all of them died under mysterious circumstances. This 
   &quot;coincidence&quot; doesn't escape the attention of Police 
   Superintendant Dunphy (Jos&eacute; Luis L&oacute;pez V&aacute;zquez), 
   who charges Arthur with Gladys' murder, since she had a rather large 
   life insurance policy that he was going to collect. Arthur is brought 
   to trial and as it looks like the evidence is about to convict him,

   taken aback and asks the woman if they have met before, the woman 
   saying nothing and walking away quickly. Arthur and Julie get married 
   and Julie takes a &#163;50,000 life insurance policy on herself to 
   show Arthur she trusts him. Arthur catches Julie searching his attic, 
   which is full of his three dead wives' belongings. They get into a 
   fight, Arthur slapping her and Julie runs away and disappears. Arthur 
   goes searching for her, finding Julie's car next to some steep 
   cliffs. Arthur believes Julie jumped off a cliff, committing suicide 
   and reports it to the police. One officer is surprised to hear that 
   Arthur married Julie Spencer, because, three years ago, she was 
   accused of killing her husband and was committed to an insane asylum. 
   Arthur then talks to Julie's psychiatrist, Dr. Shepherd (Manuel

   and not to mention to her anything about her first husband's death, 
   because it will upset her and to play along with her, which Arthur

   it. Add to that no nudity and very little violence and, as a giallo

   This mystery thriller, narrated by French Police Inspector Pontaine 
   (Humphrey Bogart lookalike Robert Sacchi), opens with the Inspector 
   and his men chasing an unknown figure up the Eiffel Tower. When the 
   figure falls off the top of the tower, the Inspector flashes-back to 
   how it all began. Thief Antoine Gottvalles (Peter Martell) is in love 
   with prostitute Francine <A HREF="french_sex_murders_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/french sex murders dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="165" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(Barbara
    Bouchet) and will do anything to be with her, including robbing 
   mansions of expensive jewelry to finance his visits to see her at the 
   high-class brothel run by Madame Coletta (Anita Ekberg). When 
   Francine is brutally murdered at the brothel, the Inspector thinks 
   Antoine is the guilty party because he was Fancine's last customer 
   before she died (We see Antoine slap her around and call her a 
   &quot;whore&quot; when she goes to meet her next customer, but we 
   don't see him kill her). The Inspector catches Antoine rather easily, 
   he is brought to trial, found guilty and sentenced to death by 
   guillotine. Antoine swears his innocence and curses all those in 
   attendance at his trial, including the judge, Madame Colette, ex-wife 
   Marianne (Rosalba Neri), forensics expert Professor Waldemar (Howard 
   Vernon), writer Randall (Renato Romano) and other prostitutes that 
   testified against him. Antoine escapes from custody when being 
   transferred to prison and steals a motorcycle, but he is beheaded in 
   a freak accident while evading the police. Why then are the people he 
   lashed-out against in court being murdered? Inspector Pontaine now 
   believes that Antoine was set-up and intends to find out who did it. 
   The Professor pulls some strings and obtains Antoine's severed head 
   and orders his assistant, Roget (William Alexander), who is having a 
   secret affair with the Professor's mysterious daughter Elenora 
   (Evelyn Kraft of <B><A HREF="mighty_peking_man_1977.htm">THE MIGHTY 
   PEKING MAN</A></B> - 1977), to remove the right eye from Antoine's 
   head. As Roget is doing so, he swears that he saw the pupil of the 
   eye contract, which is a medical impossibility. Madame Colette is 
   brutally murdered with a lamp by an unknown gloved assailant. The 
   next to die is the judge. His throat is cut while his cheating wife 
   is screwing her lover in the next room. When some of the prostitutes 
   and Marianne are murdered next, the Inspector finds a clue in 
   Randall's writings that proves that one of the women still alive use 
   to be a prostitute in Madame Colette's brothel. As the Inspector and 
   his men race to warn Randall that he may be next, they are too late 
   (they find Marianne beheaded and another girl with her eyes cut out). 
   Randall has been run<A HREF="bogeyman_and_the_french_murders_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/bogeyman and the french murders british vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="133" HEIGHT="214" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>-through
    with a sword, but he has scrawled an &quot;M&quot; on the floor in 
   his own blood. After a short investigation, the Inspector realizes 
   that Randall actually wrote a &quot;W&quot; on the floor, which leads 
   to the real killer and the chase to the top of the Eiffel Tower in 
   the beginning of the film.&nbsp; This early 70's French/Itallian 
   giallo, directed by Ferdinando Merrighi (who was also First Assistant 
   Director on <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CryOfAProstitute">CRY OF A PROSTITUTE</A></B> 
   - 1974), using the pseudonym &quot;F.L. Morris&quot;, contains enough 
   red herrings to satisfy the appetite of an overweight seal. While 
   it's quite obvious who the killer is (at least to me), the film has 
   enough eye-popping nudity and gross-out moments, including an 
   uncomfortable dissection on what looks to be a real eye (hopefully, 
   it's a cow's or some other animal's eye and not an actual human 
   eyeball), to keep the viewer entertained. The casting of Bogart 
   doppelganger Robert Sacchi (<B><A HREF="man_with_bogarts_face_1980.htm">THE
    MAN WITH BOGART'S FACE</A></B> - 1980) as the police inspector also 
   holds some novelty value (this was also released under the title <B><A HREF="bogeyman_and_the_french_murders_1972.htm">THE
    BOGEYMAN AND THE FRENCH MURDERS</A></B> to cash-in on Sacchi's 
   uncanny likeness). The character name of the sleazy writer Randall 
   was a little in-joke in reference to the late Dick Randall (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Pieces">PIECES</A></B> 
   - 1982), who was one of the producers (with Marius Mattei) here. As 
   with a lot of European genre films of the 70's, incest plays a key 
   role in the plot. This is an enjoyable and violent (including two 
   beheadings) murder mystery that should satisfy fans of giallo as well 
   as fans of nudity. Barbara Bouchet (<B><A HREF="#MilanoCalibro9">MILANO

   White Man's treatment of Indians hasn't changed much since the days 
   of Plymouth Rock and, if we wait long enough, we will see the Indian 
   exact his special brand of revenge. Camper John Allen (William Smith; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Invasion Of The Bee">INVASION

    a beer from white girl Betty Schaeffer (C.J. Hincks), telling her,

   him, but John leads them on a chase with his motorcycle before he is 
   caught and brought to the police station, where Ken and a battered 
   Betty accuse him of rape. The town's entire white population wants to 
   hang Camper John, with Ken egging them on and they nearly kill John's 
   deaf brother Richard (Ned Romero) at Beeker's Bar (They step on his 
   head and grind his face on some broken glass). The townspeople also 
   beat-up a few teenage Indians just for walking on their streets. 
   While Camper John is being escorted to county jail, some Indian 
   friends, including Gayle, rescue him, drive to the desert and let 
   Sheriff McVaney and Deputy Moody go free, only they are handcuffed to 
   each other (in a very unusual manner) and stripped to their 
   underwear. Things really get bad when the easily-manipulated 
   townspeople destroy the Indian village (they drive their pickup 
   trucks through all the shacks) and Ken kills Richard by shotgunning 
   him in the back and then hanging him. Now it's Camper John's turn to 
   get revenge, but at what cost?&nbsp; As directed and co-written by 
   Sean MacGregor (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#NightmareCounty1971">NIGHTMARE
    COUNTY</A></B> - 1971; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Devil Times Five">DEVIL
    TIMES FIVE</A></B> - 1974), <B>GENTLE SAVAGE</B> is much too slowly 
   paced to register with exploitation fans. The film has a hard time 
   deciding whether it is going to be a revenge thriller, a comedy 
   (you're guaranteed a comical moment whenever Joe Flynn, who died a 
   year later, is on-screen) or some Indian mysticism bullshit (the 
   screenplay was co-written by someone named &quot;Jaguar Long 
   Dancer&quot;. Yeah, and my Indian name is &quot;Running With 
   Shingles&quot;!), The violence is rather tame considering the subject 
   matter and includes a few gunshots, explosions and vehicle 
   destruction. For all the talk of rape, there is not one instance of 
   female nudity, although it is implied that Ken has sexually assaulted 
   Betty in the past (it is not until late in the film that we discover 
   Betty is actually Ken's stepdaughter, so it tempers the incest angle 
   somewhat). The entire film lacks the proper edge that makes a movie a 
   good revenge thriller. All the characters are thinly-drawn (William 
   Smith's Camper John has no backstory at all) and the actions scenes 
   are rather anemic. There's not much here to recommend except a cast 
   of seasoned character actors given very little to do. That's the

    IN ROOM 2A</A><A NAME="GirlInRoom2A"></A> (1973) -</B> This film 
   opens with a girl named Edie being kidnapped, injected with drugs and 
   waking up tied-up and naked in a room while a long spike (coming out 
   of a hole in the wall) punctures her chest and stomach several times. 
   Then someone wearing red gloves cuts her loose, impales her through 
   the back with a blade (until the blade protrudes between her breasts) 
   and throws her body over a cliff to make it look like a suicide (It's 
   all very fragmented and looks to be heavily edited). We are then 
   introduced to Margaret (Daniela Giordano). She has just been released 
   from a women's prison and rents a room (#2A) in a nearby 
   boardinghouse run by Mrs. Grant (Giovanna Galetti). As soon as she 
   settles in her room, she notices a huge bloodstain on the floor that 
   she can't seem to wash away. That night she has a dream that someone 
   dressed in a red stocking mask, cape and gloves (the same person who 
   killed Edie) invades her room and looms over her bed. <A HREF="girl_in_room_2a_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/girl in room 2a vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="267" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Was
    it a dream? Could it have something to do with Mr. Dreese (Raf 
   Vallone), the leader of some strange cult who resorts to murder to 
   keep his secret? Margaret strikes up a friendship with Mrs. Grant's 
   son, Frank (Angelo Infanti), but things sour quickly when Frank 
   doesn't believe her when she says that she was unjustly sent to 
   prison. Margaret wants to move out of the boardinghouse (that damn 
   bloodstain keeps reappearing every time she scrubs it away), but her 
   lack of a job and her parole officer (Rosalba Neri) make it 
   impossible for her to do so. Margaret meets Edie's brother, Jack 
   (John Scanlon), who doesn't believe his sister committed suicide. 
   Jack talks to Edie's former boyfriend Charlie (Brad Harris) and 
   learns that Edie also spent a short time in the same prison as 
   Margaret did. What is the connection between the prison, Mrs. Grant's 
   boardinghouse and the mysterious Mr. Dreese? And who is the 
   mysterious masked killer in red we see killing people with a cane 
   equipped with a spring-loaded blade? As both Margaret and Jack get 
   closer to the truth, we also learn that the death of Frank's father 
   years earlier plays into this mystery. A trip to an insane asylum, 
   where one of the previous female tenants of Room 2A was committed, 
   gives Margaret and Jack further evidence of the dastardly goings-on 
   at the boardinghouse, but before they can do anything about it, 
   Margaret is drugged and kidnapped from Room 2A that night. Is she to 
   suffer the same fate as Edie or can Jack save her in time?&nbsp; This 
   early 70's gaillo, directed/produced/scripted by William L. Rose (who 
   also scripted <B><A HREF="frankensteins_castle_of_freaks_1973.htm">FRANKENSTEIN'S
    CASTLE OF FREAKS</A></B> - 1973) is not much of a mystery (maybe 
   I've just seen too many of these films), but it does have it's share 
   of tense moments and bloody set-pieces (although it looks like some 
   of the more violent and sexual bits were trimmed to achieve an 
   R-rating). You'll witness naked women being whipped, a woman getting 
   decapitated (mostly off-screen, but we do get to see the bloody 
   head), a man being forced to put his hand on a red-hot fireplace 
   grate and various stabbings. The final twenty minutes, where the 
   mystery is revealed and how the bloodstain on the floor of Room 2A 
   keeps reappearing (it's the film's most ingenious moment) is kind of 
   a letdown. The cult turns out to be nothing but a bunch of crazy 
   fanatics (including Mrs. Grant, who is getting retribution for her 
   husband's hit-and-run death years earlier) who get off on punishing 
   naughty girls released from prison and they use someone dressed like

    OF PSYCHOTIC WOMEN</A><A NAME="HousePsychoticWomen"></A> (1973) -</B> 
   Penniless drifter Gilles (Paul Naschy), who has nightmares about 
   strangling a woman, is picked up hitch-hiking by Claude (Diana 
   Lorys), a woman with a hideously burned arm and a prosthetic hand. 
   She hires him to be the handyman at the house she shares with her two 
   sisters. Arriving at the house, Gilles meets the other two sisters: 
   The sexy Nicole (Eva Leon) and the wheelchair-bound Ivette (Maria 
   Perschy). Nicole begins hitting on Gilles immediately, feeling his 
   muscles while chopping wood shirtless and later coming to his bedroom 
   to make love. Claude spies on them doing the nasty, becomes jealous 
   and voices<A HREF="house_of_psychotic_women_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/house of psychotic women vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="231" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   her displeasure to Gilles the next morning (while cutting a chicken 
   with a cleaver). A new nurse, Michelle (Ines Morales), arrives at the 
   house to take care of Ivette (we do not know why she is in the 
   wheelchair, only that the doctor thinks it's psychosomatic), but she 
   may be there for more nefarious reasons. Gilles is attacked outside 
   by the former handyman Jean and a knife fight ensues. Gilles gets 
   slashed on the side (Jean is stabbed in the stomach, but runs away) 
   and the police are called, where we learn that Ivette's old nurse was 
   found strangled on the side of the road. While Gilles is recuperating 
   in bed, Claude visits and they make love. Another woman in town is 
   found stabbed to death with her eyes missing. The police suspect 
   Gilles (he is the only new person in town and he is having those 
   nightmares), but it is apparent after a while that he is just but one 
   of a town full of red herrings, as more women turn up brutally 
   murdered with their eyes removed. How does this all tie in with 
   Claude's prothetic hand and Ivette in the wheelchair? Why are only 
   blond women with blue eyes being murdered? You'll just have to see 
   for yourself.&nbsp; Originally titled <B><A HREF="blue_eyes_of_the_broken_doll_1973.htm">BLUE
    EYES OF THE BROKEN DOLL</A></B> (which really gives away too much of 
   the film's punch line), Sam Sherman's Independent International 
   Pictures picked this up for distribution in 1975, edited some of the 
   murders and nudity so it could obtain an R rating and retitled it 
   with this more exploitative title. Director Carlos Aured (who also 
   made <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Horror Rises Tomb">HORROR RISES 
   FROM THE TOMB</A></B> [1972] with Naschy) co-wrote this with Naschy 
   (who uses his real name, Jacinto Molina, for screenwriting credit) 
   and gives <B><A HREF="house_of_psychotic_women_1973b.htm">HOUSE OF 
   PSYCHOTIC WOMEN</A></B> a nice giallo feel. The unseen killer (the 
   hands are all that's seen) begins murdering the female cast with 
   various weapons, using meat cleavers, knives, a garden claw and other 
   utensils and then removing their eyes and carrying them carefully in 
   black-gloved hands before depositing them in glass jars. 
   Barrel-chested Paul Naschy dies a particularly nasty death in this 
   one as his foot is caught in a bear trap while police (who mistakenly 
   think he is the killer) pump a dozen bullets and shotgun shells into 
   him in slow motion. The mystery element in this is quite good 
   (although the killer is obvious, or is it?) and the music soundtrack, 
   which switches from breezy jazz to a sinister version of &quot;Frere 
   Jacque&quot;, keeps the film suspenseful without being pretentious. 
   The revelation in the final minute is really a gruesome sight. 
   Worthwhile viewing for fans of Spanish horror.&nbsp; Also starring

    They arrive at the party and meet Gloria (Lorraine De Selle; <B><A HREF="cannibal_ferox_1981.htm">CANNIBAL

   model Glenda (Marie Claude Joseph). It's plain to see that these 
   people are just as bad as Alex, if not worse. They see that Ricky is 
   a little light in the head and talk him into doing a striptease to 
   some disco music. Alex is none too pleased that they are making a 
   fool out of Ricky, but Ricky tells him he is enjoying himself. Lisa 
   then puts the moves on Alex but she is nothing but a giant cocktease. 
   She strips naked and takes a shower in front of Alex, asking him to 
   wash her back and join her. But when Alex strips naked and gets into 
   the shower, she jumps out and says, &quot;Rinse your brains out, King 
   Kong!&quot; Alex then catches Tom cheating a poker, making Ricky lose 
   all his money. A fight breaks out where Alex puts his strait razor to 
   Tom's throat and he makes them play poker his way, where Ricky just 
   says he has a royal straight without showing them his cards. Alex 
   then says, &quot;We're going to have fun with these cunts!&quot; and 
   has Ricky pick out a girl to fuck in front of them. Ricky picks 
   Gloria, but when he puts the moves on her, Tom And Howard rush Alex 
   and try to take the strait razor from him. They fail, as Alex cuts 
   Tom's face and throws Howard into the pool (Alex then pisses on 
   Howard and into the pool). Alex locks all the doors and then the 
   &quot;fun&quot; begins, if your idea of fun is total human 
   debasement. The problem is, we don't know who is being debased.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Alex rapes Lisa, but the more she fights him off, the more turned-on 
   she becomes. Alex bashes Tom's face into a table over-and-over, but 
   he never makes a sound (in fact, he smiles). Alex makes Lisa and 
   Glenda make love to each other, but they are into it. Everything 
   changes when next door neighbor Cindy (Brigitte Petronio; <B><A HREF="cynic_the_rat_and_the_fist_1977.htm">THE

   escapes, with Ricky chasing her (&quot;Don't act like this! I don't

   very hard to watch because Cindy has the body of a young teenage 
   girl), Gloria and Ricky are making love in the garden (the most 
   unnerving part of this sequence is when Alex sings a topless Cindy a

   down her pants). Do you think you know how this is going to end? Do

    There are plenty of extras on the Blu-Ray to get your mind off this 
   film, the most importand being the 30-minute interview with David 
   Hess, who died just a few months after recording this. He talks 
   openly about this film (making it seem more important than it is), 
   but refuses to answer if the girl he raped in the park (Karoline 
   Mardeck) was his wife in real life (all he says is, &quot;I'll let 
   her answer that!&quot;) and, sure enough, another extra on the disc 
   is an interview with Mardeck, where she gives an answer to that 
   question (buy the Blu-Ray if you want the answer!). Otherwise Hess is 
   open and honest about every question thrown at him (He says that he 
   and Annie Bell actually made love during her rape scene! He goes on 
   to say it is not as uncommon as we think!). Hess also said he only 
   took this role if he could get a percentage of the profits from the 
   film's American rights. Smart man who left us far too soon. Hess also 
   starred in Deodato's <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Bodycount">BODY

    We see Tony falling in love with the beautiful Leslie (Erika Blanc; <B><A HREF="#NightEvelynGrave71">THE
    NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE</A></B> - 1971), immediately 
   followed by him dodging machine gun fire. An unseen voice yells out,

   shouldn't have crossed their path. I got a contract out on you! But I 
   can't do it. Get the hell out of here! Don't ever come back to the

    Back on the plane, Tony lands at Kennedy Airport in New York City, 
   makes a phone call (no answer) and hails a cab. He notices that 
   someone is following him, so he jumps out of the cab and loses his 
   tail in the busy subway system. He makes another unanswered phone 
   call and then goes to an apartment and knocks on the door. The door 
   is already open, so he lets himself in, finding the inside of the 
   apartment ransacked. The phone then rings and no one is on the other 
   end. After almost killing the apartment building's janitor (who 
   enters the apartment after finding the door open), the phone rings 
   again and it is Leslie. This is Leslie's apartment and Tony asks her 
   if she knows her place was broken into. Leslie tells him he shouldn't 
   be there, it's too dangerous and begs Tony to come get her; she is at 
   a friend's place in Brooklyn. Tony takes a taxi to the address, not 
   noticing that there's a creepy looking man watching the building, as 
   he enters the apartment building. We then learn why Tony is back in 
   the States after being warned never to return. Tony asks Leslie how 
   his brother, Johnny, died. Leslie tells him that she and his brother 
   were at a football game last Sunday (Leslie calls it 
   &quot;rugby&quot;, but no one has ever played that professionally in 
   NYC!), as a flashback shows us what happened to Johnny. As Leslie and 
   Johnny are sitting in the stadium, an unseen assassin's bullet rips 
   through Johnny's skull, killing him instantly. Johnny falls to the 
   ground while everyone is cheering a touchdown and Leslie cradles him, 
   getting his blood on her hands. Leslie tells Tony that the police 
   told her that Johnny was killed by a high-powered rifle, the assassin 
   firing the deadly bullet from a far distance. Tony thinks his 
   brother's murder was a vendetta against him, but Leslie tells him 
   that Johnny was doing business with crook George MacGreves (Alberto 
   de Mendoza; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#LizardWomansSkin">A LIZARD IN A 
   WOMAN'S SKIN</A></B> - 1971) in Kenya and his murder may have 
   something to do with that. Johnny traveled back and forth from Kenya 
   to NYC, also doing business with a man called Terence Mortimer 
   (Luciano Pigozzi; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Tornado1983">TORNADO</A></B> 
   - 1983) in this city, which is why he was in NYC last Sunday. Tony 
   knows who Mortimer is, as a look of anger appears on his face. Just 
   what was his brother doing that would get himself killed in cold 
   blood? Tony aims to find out and he isn't taking any prisoners.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Mortimer was a member of Tony's old gang and he tells Leslie that he 
   knows someone who can tell him where to find this &quot;shady 
   guy.&quot; Leslie begs him not to go because he'll get himself 
   killed, but Tony tells her, &quot;I gotta find out who did it!&quot; 
   Tony goes looking for old gang member Maxie (Gilberto Galimberti, as 
   &quot;Gill Rolland&quot;; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Manhunt1972">MANHUNT</A></B> 
   - 1972) at his place of work, only to be told that Maxie hasn't 
   worked there for three years, but he lives nearby and everyone on 
   Foster Street knows him. Tony finds out where Maxie lives by talking 
   to people on the street and when he knocks on his door, Maxie is 
   quite surprised (and scared) to see Tony, telling him he hasn't been 
   in the &quot;racket&quot; since Tony left the States three years ago. 
   Tony is not convinced, grabbing Maxie by the collar and demanding to 
   know where Mortimer is, so Maxie tells him to talk to Manuel (Miguel 
   del Castillo; <B><A HREF="#StrangeViceWardh71">THE STRANGE VICE OF 
   MRS. WARDH</A></B> - 1971) at the Pamplona Restaurant in Flatbush. 
   Tony then talks to Manuel at the restaurant, asking him where 
   Mortimer is, when two hoods walk into the restaurant and tell Manuel 
   to lock the front door. One hood tells Tony that he has a message to 
   deliver and since the mailmen are on strike, he and his hood friend 
   are here to deliver it personally. A fight breaks out and Tony beats 
   the snot out of the two hoods and then leaves the restaurant. Tony 
   knows who sent the two hoods to rough him up, the same man who spared 
   him three years ago, telling him to never return to the States.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    His name is Mr. Humphrey (Luis Induni; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#WerewolfAndTheYeti">THE
    WEREWOLF AND THE YETI</A></B> - 1975), a New York crime kingpin, and 
   when Tony meets him, Humphrey tells him he was not supposed to come 
   back here. Tony tells him he came back because of Johnny's murder and 
   asks where Mortimer is. Humphrey tells him he never knew Johnny and, 
   as for Mortimer, he has no idea where he is; Mortimer hasn't worked 
   for him for three years. Humphrey does give Tony Mortimer's current 
   address, but gives Tony this warning: &quot;We don't cross your path 
   unless you don't cross ours. Got it?&quot; (The person who supplied 
   the English subtitles has a tenuous grasp of English sentence 
   structure, but it's not hard to decipher the true meaning of the 
   warning and other badly worded dialogue). Tony then walks to 
   Mortimer's address (he should have rented a car!), breaking down the 
   door to his apartment, but a profusely sweating Mortimer holds Tony 
   at bay with a pistol. Tony knocks the gun out of his hands and asks 
   Mortimer if he killed Johnny, but Mortimer denies it, telling Tony 
   this story: &quot;I wasn't scoring well...Johnny had been living in 
   Kenya for a year...One day he came to see me. He told me that down 
   there grass is cheap. Here the price is more than doubled! I needed 
   some serious dough and he helped me out. Things were going pretty 
   well, but they put a bullet in his brain. Why did they take off just 
   him and spare me? So I locked myself here. Our little business must 
   have upset someone. So they went for the guns. They were going to 
   kill you, too, isn't it?&quot; (See what I mean about sentence 
   structure?) Tony is sure there is more to the story and tells 
   Mortimer if he can think of anything else, to contact him at his 
   hotel, then he leaves. When Tony and Leslie get to the hotel, there 
   is a message waiting for him from Mortimer, who remembered something 
   important Tony needs to know. Unfortunately, Tony will never get to 
   hear it, as the creepy man who was watching Leslie's apartment 
   building cuts Mortimer's throat with a straight razor. Are the 
   reasons for Johnny's murder personal or is there more to the story? 
   And just who ordered Johnny and Mortimer's murders? Tony aims to find 
   out and it will take him all the way to Nairobi, Kenya. There will be 
   more deaths (including one by elephant!), poisonous cobra milking, a 
   safari and lots of treachery ahead for Tony, as he tries to get 
   retribution for his brother's death. It will lead to him killing an 
   innocent man, not knowing that someone very close to him is actually 
   the guilty party. Still need a hint as to who the killer is? Pay 
   close attention to the names on a plane manifest that a Nairobi cop

   New York City in the early-'70s will bring a rush of nostalgia over 
   anyone who lived or visited there during that time period (as I did) 
   and the sequences filmed in Nairobi make it stand out from most 
   Italian genre films, even though Giorgio Ardisson makes for a pretty 
   bland hero and the mystery is not that hard to solve (There is a 
   nifty surprise during the last five minutes, though). But this is a 
   film chock-full of actors well versed in both genres, including Erika 
   Blanc, Alberto de Mendoza, Luciano Pigozzi (who doesn't use his 
   &quot;Alan Collins&quot; pseudonym here, a rarity) and the recently 
   deceased <A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_3.htm#JanineReynaud">Janine Reynaud</A> (<B><A HREF="#CaseScorpionsTail71">CASE

   Clara. She shows up at a gambling parlor in Kenya and is key to 
   solving Johnny's murder, since she was his girlfriend when he was in 
   Kenya, before she ends up dead by the assassin's straight razor. The <A HREF="human_cobras_1971.htm#OST">music
    soundtrack</A>, by <A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_3.htm#StelvioCipriani">Stelvio
    Cipriani</A>, is one of his weakest efforts and is not memorable at 
   all, unlike his many other music compositions. There's plenty of 
   nudity (but for some reason, Erika Blanc wears a bikini when she 
   takes a shower in the Kenya wild during a safari!), some of it very 
   voyeuristic (you'll know it when you see it) and plenty of graphic 
   violence (including one of the cast getting their head squashed by a 
   wounded elephant!) to take your mind off the generic plot, making 
   this film one of Albertini's best, at least for me. So leave your 
   brain at the door and your eyes on the screen and you should have

   spends most of their time in New York, so John taps into the

    only with rotary phone modems and dot matrix printers) and not 
   enough on the actual revenge. While there are some eerie parallels to 
   what we are going through in the New Millennium (Terrorists targeting 
   Americans; the computer program John and Mike are working on in the 
   military base is goose-bumpingly called the &quot;9-11 Project&quot;),
    the film fails to generate much suspense thanks to the snail-like 
   pacing and the awkward performance by George Kennedy. Hey, I'm a huge 
   fan of Mr. Kennedy, but he's miscast in this vehicle and it's plain 
   to see that he's out of his comfort zone because some of his line 
   readings are dreadful. It's also hard to accept him as a computer 
   expert of any kind, nevermind a leading expert in his field. By the 
   time Kennedy gets to do an action scene (which is somewhere past the 
   one hour mark), most viewers will have fallen asleep or turned it 
   off. Those with more patience will finally see Mr. Kennedy get into a 
   gunfight; run over a terrorist with a Volkswagen Beetle; get smacked 
   with a shovel and then kill the same terrorist with a chain neck 
   tourniquet; and then finally facing-down the killers of his family in

   to find out his patterns. When he goes to kill him, Aric find his 
   dead body with a note attached that says, &quot;I know your 
   pattern&quot;. Arik is now being stalked by another serial killer. 
   Not knowing who this person is (his phone calls only identify him as 
   &quot;Dark&quot;), Aric hires a private detective to keep an eye on 
   his house. The private detective tells Aric that another private 
   detective was hired to follow him, thereby giving Dark information on 
   his moves. Aric goes to Dark's hired private detective's house and 
   steals information off his computer. This information leads Aric to 
   the identity of Dark and the cat-and-mouse game is on.&nbsp; After 
   double and triple crosses, we finally find out who the better serial 
   killer is. This taut thriller is told strictly from Aric's point of 
   view. We hear his innermost thoughts (through voiceover narration) 
   and his true disdain for the human race. You would think that it 
   would be hard to root for Aric and what he was going through since he 
   such a cold-hearted murderer. The surprise is that it's not, thanks 
   to director Kevin Kangas' literate screenplay which doesn't insult 
   the viewer with pat explanations on why a serial killer kills. The 
   finale is definitely a doozy with many twists. Ganz (who also 
   produced) is excellent, even if the other actors come up short.&nbsp;

   (1973) -</B> Loner Mark (Christopher Augustine) walks into a 
   caf&eacute; and hits on a hippy chick sitting by herself. Quicker 
   than you can say, &quot;Oops, my panties fell off!&quot;, she takes 
   Mark home, where they light some candles, smoke a joint and she 
   strips completely naked. Oddly, though, Mark doesn't remove a stitch 
   of his clothing (Maybe the Janis Joplin poster on her wall stopped 
   him from getting an erection? Man, she was ugly!) and we soon find 
   out why: He strangles her with one hand, sobs a little and then has 
   flashbacks to his childhood (shown as a series of still photographs 
   during the opening credits), which shows Mark as one of two male 
   members of a large family of females (in nearly all the flashback 
   photos, young Mark is shown separated from the rest of the family, 
   depicting alienation and loneliness) and he may be responsible for 
   the death his younger brother by pushing his stroller in front of an 
   oncoming car. Mark now works as a cinematographer, shooting porn

   his perch overlooking the porn action. While shooting an S&amp;M loop

    meets new performer Michele (Jeanette Dilger) and gives her a ride 
   home. They seemingly hit it off, talking about their hopes and 
   dreams, but Mark becomes intrigued with Michele when she refuses to 
   go any further than a kiss (He says, &quot;You're different and 
   you're worth it.&quot;), even when he finds out that she's a kept 
   woman. Mark works out his sexual frustrations by going to a peep show 
   located in the back of an adult bookstore (that blares religious 
   programming on a radio!), only to discover it's one of his own loops. 
   Mark wants to become a legitimate cameraman, but he's stuck in a 
   catch-22 situation because potential employers want to see examples 
   of his previous work, something he is too embarrassed to do. Mark 
   picks up a young female hitchhiker and they rent a boat and take a 
   cruise out on the ocean, where he strangles her and tosses her 
   overboard after she begins talking about her brother. When Mark 
   receives a &quot;Dear John&quot; audiotape from Michele, he rushes 
   over to her house and they make passionate love. Mark wakes up the 
   next morning to discover that he has strangled Michele, so he decides 
   to end it all by filming his own suicide at the Hollywood Sign. Too 
   bad he can't show that footage to potential new employers!&nbsp; This 
   relic from the early 70's, which was shot as <B><A HREF="hollywood_90028_1973.htm">HOLLYWOOD

   horror film. It's actually a talky psychodrama (with a pro-feminist 
   slant) about a man who wants to make a better life for himself, but 
   occurrences from his past keep dredging themselves up whenever he 
   starts getting tingly in his pants or anyone mentions they have a 
   brother. Director/producer Christine Hornisher and screenwriter Craig 
   Hansen (the only feature film credit for both) have created a film 
   that really has nothing much to say (If this film has anything to 
   say, it's this: It's probably best not to work in porn if you have 
   severe emotional issues, but I really doubt we needed a film to tell 
   us that, right? Right?). Mark is portrayed as a sympathetic 
   character, but it's hard to muster sympathy for someone who strangles 
   innocent women just because they want to have sex or love their 
   family, two things that Mark clearly can't do without someone 
   suffering dire consequences. It also doesn't help that Mark's 
   motivations are exposed during the opening credits, which ruins any 
   chance for the viewer of uncovering for themselves as the film 
   progresses. While there is plenty of nudity, the violence level is 
   nearly non-existent (only two on-screen stranglings) and those 
   looking for blood and gore will be severely disappointed. The film's 
   most effective scene is the final shot, where Mark hangs himself on 
   the &quot;Y&quot; on the world-famous Hollywood Sign and the camera 
   pulls back in a single take until the sign is nothing but a small 
   speck on the screen. Too bad you have to suffer through 74

   for Ruth, but she says she doesn't love him any more snd tells him to 
   leave the next morning. Michel, still angry about what Ruth just 
   said, asks Paul to shoot a picture of a model on the front page of a 
   magazine while he holds it, just to see if Paul is the crack shot he 
   says he is. A gunshot rings out, showing that Paul put a bullet hole 
   directly between the model's eyes. I guess that answers Michel's question!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Ruth and Paul have a minor arguement, so Paul leaves her bedroom, 
   telling Ruth that he will leave her alone for the night. Ruth has a 
   change of heart a short time later and goes to Paul's bedroom, but 
   he's not there. She hears footsteps coming into the bedroom and 
   thinking it is Paul, she hides to surprise him. Only it is not Paul, 
   it is Michel, and he blurts out, &quot;She should be asleep by 
   now&quot;, before realizing Paul is not in the room, so he leaves. 
   Ruth follows Michel to the estate's bungalow, where she hears and 
   sees Michel, Paul and Danielle, who is Paul's girlfriend (!), 
   plotting Ruth's murder. Michel wants to inherit Ruth's vast fortune 
   before the divorce is final and plans on sharing that fortune with 
   Paul and Danielle (whom he has hired to kill Ruth, but he wants it to 
   look like an accident so the police don't get involved). It is at 
   this point that Ruth comes up with a devious plan to get revenge on 
   her husband, Paul and Danielle, but what Ruth doesn't know is that 
   Roland saw her spying on the trio.&nbsp; Will he tell Paul and ruin 
   Ruth's plan to get even or will he keep his mouth shut? I'm afraid 
   you are going to have to watch the film to get the answer, but here's 
   a few more things that go on in the film: <B>1.)</B> Michel is found 
   dead in his car, which is found crashed off the mountain road. He 
   apparently died shortly after he left Ruth's country estate. <B>2.)</B> 
   Paul finds his dog, Bernard, dead, shortly after licking ice cubes 
   that Ruth put in Michel's drink. <B>3.)</B> Paul and Danielle, 
   thinking they got the goods on Ruth for Michel's murder, invade 
   Ruth's home and physically and mentally torture her (Danielle prances 
   around in the floppy hat Ruth &quot;stole&quot; from her, proving how 
   petty Danielle actually is), but Ruth's plan for revenge is so well 
   thought-out, neither Paul or Danielle are ready for what happens 
   next. <B>4.)</B> But what about Roland? Will he come to Paul's rescue 
   or will he remain silent? I'll leave that for you to discover, as 
   well as Ruth's complex plan for revenge (It's quite unique).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Spain/Italy co-production is a pretty lackluster giallo film, thanks 
   to a plot that has been done countless time before, even if Ruth's 
   plan for revenge is very well done. It's really the only surprising 
   bit in the film, as everything else can be guessed correctly by 
   people with low IQs. Yes, it's the old &quot;let's murder the wife so 
   the husband can inherit her fortune&quot; scenario and director 
   Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Forqu&eacute; (whose only other film of note 
   seems to be the David Hemmings-starrer <B><A HREF="beyond_erotica_1974.htm">BEYOND
    EROTICA</A></B> - 1974), who co-wrote the screenplay with Rafael 
   Azcona (the previously mentioned <B><A HREF="cross_current_1971.htm">CROSS

    KNOCKS TWICE</A></B> - 1969), just lets the film skate on this thin 
   ice of a plot until Ruth decides to get revenge. Roland does give 
   Ruth a knowing explanation (in a long bit of dialogue) of why his 
   chest is scarred (it was done by a lion), which influences Ruth in 
   her plan for revenge. If only the rest of the film was as well as 
   thought-out as Ruth's plan, this would be a top-notch giallo flick, 
   but as it stands, it's a cliched plot whose only positive is the 
   gorgeous cinematography (by Alejandro Ulloa; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#ForbiddenPhotos1970">THE
    FORBIDDEN PHOTOS OF A LADY ABOVE SUSPICION</A></B> - 1970). Both 
   Anal&iacute;a Gad&eacute; and Rosanna Yanni are beautiful in and out 
   of their clothes, which others may also find a positive, but the 
   violence level is very low, as we don't see any blood or gore (Even 
   Michel's death is not shown; it's only talked about). The music

   not memorable at all; just some lounge music to rock you to sleep. 
   All in all, this thriller is only worth viewing if you have to watch 
   every giallo film ever made. That's my excuse, what is yours?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    -</B> First a word of warning: If you want to see this film in any 
   type of comprehensible form, do <U>not</U> watch the version in any 
   of Brentwood Communications' DVD movie compilations, such as their 10 
   movie comp. titled <B><A HREF="curse_of_the_dead_dvd_comp.htm">CURSE 
   OF THE DEAD</A></B>. It's only 69 minutes long (don't be fooled by 
   the 102-minute label on the comp's packaging, because it's a lie) and 
   looks to be a TV edit to fit in a 90 minute slot. It's an abortion. 
   That said, let's get on to the movie. Laura (Judy Geeson) flies to 
   Spain to spend some quality time with her sister but, when she 
   arrives at the hotel run by sisters Marta and Veronica, she is told 
   that her sister has left and won't be coming back. It's apparent that 
   one, or maybe both, of the sisters is a cold-blooded killer and 
   Laura's sister is long dead. Marta (Aurora Bautista), the dominant 
   sister, is sexually repressed and her sexual frustrations (which 
   includes spying on young boys bathing nude in a nearby lake) forces 
   her to murder all the young women <A HREF="it_happened_at_nightmare_inn_1970.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/it happened at nightmare inn vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="123" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(and
    some men) who stay at the hotel and &quot;flaunt&quot; their 
   sexuality. Veronica (Esperanza Roy), the timid sister, goes along 
   with whatever Marta does because, frankly, she's one scary bitch. 
   Laura (who is not a loose woman, so she's fairly safe here, at least 
   for a while) becomes more and more suspicious as the young ladies who 
   check in begin disappearing in the middle of the night, the sisters 
   telling her that they have checked out. Since there isn't much of a 
   police force in town, Laura brings her concerns to the mayor, who 
   tells her that Marta once had a lover who disappeared after he dumped 
   her and took up with a younger, more &quot;modern&quot; woman. When 
   Norma (Blanca Estrada), an unwed mother (or so we're told), checks 
   into the hotel, Laura begins to look after her, fearing for her and 
   the baby's life. Marta and Veronica plot to kill Norma and raise the 
   baby as their own. Norma catches on, but it's too late. Marta plants 
   a cleaver in her back and puts her in a barrel of wine in the cellar, 
   where she put all the previous victims. As more young tourists arrive 
   at the hotel, Laura must find a way to stop the sisters and save the 
   baby. Director Eugenio Martin (<B><A HREF="#FourthVictim1971">THE 
   FOURTH VICTIM</A></B> - 1971; <B><A HREF="horror_express_1972.htm">HORROR
    EXPRESS</A></B> - 1972), who also co-wrote the script with Antonio 
   Fos, gives us a thinly-disguised parable about politics in Spain. The 
   young tourists represent the post-Franco regime, when everything 
   loosened-up and much more sexual freedom and openess was permitted. 
   The two sisters represent the strict Franco rule, where freedoms of 
   all kinds were repressed and outlawed. Refusing to change with the 
   times, the sisters are forced to kill anyone that doesn't adhere to 
   their strict Catholic upbringing. Things begin to get messy when the 
   sisters serve tainted wine (spoiled by the rotting bodies stuffed in 
   the barrels) with dinner, some of the guests become sick and one 
   guest finds a women's eye in his glass, which he turns over to the 
   local authorities. This leads to a final showdown in which the 
   townpeople storm the hotel and save Laura in the nick of time from 
   the clutches of the sisters. Insert your own political allegory here. 
   Director Martin has the camera linger lovingly on close-ups of raw 
   meat, knives, cleavers and other kitchen utensils that will 
   eventually be used as weapons. There's also copious nudity from the 
   young cast, but you'll see none of the blood or skin in the 69 minute 
   version. You will need to find copies of this film titled <B><A HREF="candle_for_the_devil_1970.htm">A

   Johnny's life when Ned tries to stab him with a broken bottle (Ned to 
   Jesse: &quot;One of these days, you and me is goin' to tangle 
   assholes!&quot;), You can plainly see that Jesse is tired of being 
   under Colby's thumb, but there's not much he can do about it (more on 
   that later) and Johnny isn't making his life any easier (Jesse 
   half-heartedly says to J.B., &quot;One of these days I'm going to 
   kill that Indian.&quot;). Johnny is a man without a home, because he 
   refuses to live on the reservation (He can't understand why college 
   educated Nenya [Sacheen Littlefeather; <B><A HREF="trial_of_billy_jack_1974.htm">THE
    TRIAL OF BILLY JACK</A></B> - 1974] would return to the reservation 
   as a teacher) and he's not welcome in town, so he spends most of his 
   free time walking in the desert. We learn why Colby hates Indians so 
   much: Johnny was dating his daughter, June (Christina Hart; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#WomenBloodTerror70">WOMEN
    AND BLOODY TERROR</A></B> - 1970) before he joined the Army and 
   between now and then she became a hopeless alcoholic. When June 
   tempts Johnny an offer for a job at her Daddy's ranch (How stupid can 
   you be?) and then gets caught by Colby, Wade and Newt making love to 
   her in a barn (Really, how stupid can you be?), they string Johnny up 
   and whip him to an inch of his life before Jesse intervenes once 
   again and saves his life. Johnny is thrown in jail, where Jesse tells 
   him that June was pregnant with Johnny's child when he joined the 
   Army (Johnny didn't know, because Colby intercepted all incoming and 
   outgoing mail), but the baby was &quot;born dead&quot;, which is why 
   June now drinks like a fish (<B>Johnny:</B> &quot;Colby is not

   &quot;Chief-to-Chief&quot; for Johnny's release (<B>Colby:</B> 
   &quot;That's mighty white of you!&quot;) and gets hung for his

    CUTTHROATS</A></B> - 1971), <B>JOHNNY FIRECLOUD</B> is 
   crowd-pleasing entertainment for fans of revenge thrillers. All the 
   ingredients are here: Degradation (Nenya's gang-rape and death at the 
   hands of Ned, Wade, Newt and other rednecks is graphic and 
   disturbing); Humiliation (White Eagle's war dance in the bar); Nudity 
   (both Christina Hart and Sacheen Littlefeather go topless and 
   beyond); and bloody revenge (makeup effects by Joe Blasco; <B><A HREF="ilsa_she_wolf_of_the_ss_1974.htm">ILSA
    SHE WOLF OF THE SS</A></B> - 1975). Ned is scalped; Wade is tied to 
   a fence post and has a sack put over his head with a live rattlesnake 
   inside; a redneck gets a tomahawk thrown into his forehead; another 
   redneck is blown-up with dynamite (attached to his belt) inside a 
   motor home; Newt has his eyes plucked-out and is buried up to his 
   neck in the desert for the vultures to pick at; and Colby is hung by 
   his neck, whipped with a rope and punched in the balls, before one of 
   his ranch hands saves him (Surprisingly, he doesn't die in this 
   film). Although this is basically a tale about an Indian's revenge 
   against the White Man who did him and his tribe wrong, it is actually 
   David Canary who gets most of the audience's sympathy. He's basically 
   between a rock and a hard place. When he tells Johnny that he was 
   drummed out of the Army for being a homosexual and Colby is holding 
   that bit of information over his head, you actually feel for him (In 
   one part of the film, Jesse tells Colby that he understands how Jane 
   feels and Colby callously retorts, &quot;Women understand each other, 
   huh? They relate, huh?&quot;). Jesse always tries to do the right 
   thing in a wrong situation, but neither side, Colby or Johnny, seem 
   to appreciate it (Well, Johnny finally does sees his pain in the 
   finale and gets Jesse to do the right thing). Jesse is the lynchpin 
   of the film. Without him, the film wouldn't work nearly as well as it 
   does. It's just too bad for us that David Canary didn't appear in 
   more films, as he has spent the majority of his career acting on TV 
   soap operas. In short, you can do a lot worse than <B><A HREF="johnny_firecloud_1975b.htm">JOHNNY
    FIRECLOUD</A></B>. It is bloody, nasty and entertaining as hell. 
   There's also a human element missing in most films of this type 
   (Chief White Eagle refusing to bow to the White Man, even with a rope 
   around his neck, is one of the film's most affecting scenes). The 
   legendary David F. Friedman (<B><A HREF="she_freak_1967.htm">SHE FREAK</A></B>

   widower with very little money. A visibly annoyed Commissioner 
   Magrini (Vittorio Caprioli), who was just about to take a holiday on

   are released together. That couldn't be further from the truth. At a 
   press conference the next day, Mr. Filippini tells the reporters that

   get the money to release his son only. Mario is left hanging in the

   in Italy is a &quot;profitable business&quot;. Meanwhile, Mario's

    Mario has had enough. He is tired of Mr. Filippini's deceitful lies 
   and double-dealings. The kidnappers are apparently tired of it, too. 
   After having enough of Mr. Filippini's delaying tactics, we see one 
   of the kidnappers shoot and kill one of the sons (we don't see who it 
   is since they are wrapped in a blanket). Commissioner Magrini calls 
   both fathers to the morgue to identify the body. When the corpse 
   turns out to be Fabrizio, Mario blames Filippini for stalling and 
   vows revenge against him and the kidnappers. Mario stakes out 
   Filippini's house and follows the ransom money, uncovering treachery 
   and danger along the way. When one of the kidnappers tries to run him 
   over, Mario uses his motorcycle skills to give chase, which leads him 
   to the location where his son was being held. After killing two of 
   the kidnappers, Mario gets his hands on the ransom money and uses it 
   to exact revenge on those who ordered the murder of his son. It takes 
   him to surprising destinations and concludes with a machinegun 
   slaughter in a corporate boardroom and then Mario shooting the 
   triggerman responsible for killing his son. As Mario shoots him in

   - 1973) Mario, a low-income everyman who, at first, just wants his 
   son back but, later, just wants revenge. There's a telling scene at 
   the press conference, when one of the reporters questions Mario's 
   parenting skills when Mario mentions that the only worker he has on 
   his payroll is his twelve year-old son. When the reporter 
   sarcastically reminds him that Fabrizio is too young to be working, 
   Mario replies, &quot;I'm teaching him a trade so he doesn't grow up 
   to be a reporter.&quot; That's my favorite line in the film because 
   it's as relevant today as it was back then. Kidnapping in Italy was 
   reaching epidemic proportions when this film was lensed. Di Leo was 
   pretty much on the mark describing the kidnappers' motivations. This 
   was nothing personal, just a way for some scumbags and business types 
   to make a hefty payday. The Italian criminal system finally 
   instituted a law that blocked the bank accounts of targeted families, 
   which prevented them from paying. Kidnappings dropped drastically 
   after that. Those expecting an action-packed Italian crime film here 
   will be disappointed, but those that like well-plotted thrillers will 
   find much to enjoy. The characters are spot-on and you actually care 
   what happens to these people. The only way to truly appreciate the 
   performances are in the original Italian language, as the 
   English-dubbed track is horrible. Fortunately, Raro Video offers a 
   beautiful widescreen Italian language print (with English subtitles)

   Stage actress Eleanor (Anne Heywood: <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#RingDarkness77/79">RING
    OF DARKNESS</A></B> - 1977/1979) arrives in Belgium via ferry and 
   discovers that the last five years are missing from her memory. Her 
   house is no longer where it was supposed to be (it's an abandoned

    ABOVE, SO BELOW</A></B> - 2014), is dead and she is married to a man 
   named George (Giorgio Piazza; <B><A HREF="action.htm#ExecutionSquad1972">EXECUTION

    To make matters worse, as soon as she steps off the ferry, she sees 
   a mysterious man named Ranko Drasovic (Telly Savalas; <B><A HREF="violent_city_1970.htm">VIOLENT
    CITY</A></B> - 1970; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Lisa&amp;TheDevil1973">LISA
    AND THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1973) and passes out. All we really know 
   about Eleanor is what Dr. Chandler (Antonio Guida; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#YoungViolentDan1976">YOUNG,
    VIOLENT, DANGEROUS</A></B> - 1976) tells her. Three years ago, while 
   she was on stage performing in a play, she had some sort of 
   &quot;accident&quot; and she was lucky that he was in the audience to 
   treat her. Another thing we know about Eleanor is that Ranko is 
   following her. He is a hired assassin who has a pistol hidden in a 
   false bottom of his briefcase. Eleanor refuses to believe anything 
   anyone is telling her, believing that they are all actors playing a 
   nasty practical joke on her. But why? What kind of 
   &quot;accident&quot; was she in and why does Ranko want to kill her?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    So begins this twisty Italian mystery. I can't call it a giallo film 
   because we know who the killer is, but we don't know why he wants her 
   dead and who hired him. And the more we learn about Eleanor, we 
   discover that she may not be crazy at all, she may remember things 
   perfectly (She is also very annoying, doing stupid things at the 
   worst possible times. I hoped Ranko would kill her early in the film, 
   so we wouldn't have to put up with her bullshit. But it wouldn't be 
   much of a film, would it?). Dr. Chandler tells Eleanor's 
   &quot;friends&quot;, including Peter's sister Dorothy (Willeke van 
   Ammelrooy; <B><A HREF="lift_1983.htm">THE LIFT</A></B> - 1983), 
   husband George and fellow actor Thomas Braun (Osvaldo Ruggieri; <B><A HREF="#WerewolfWoman1976">WEREWOLF
    WOMAN</A></B> - 1976), that he wants to give Eleanor a shot of 
   sodium pentothal, truth serum, in hopes it will unlock her mind and 
   free her subconscious, asking them if anyone is afraid of learning 
   the truth. After giving each other dirty looks, George says of course 
   not, give her the injection. Thomas then tries to leave the room, but 
   Dr. Chandler stops him, saying it is best if they all stayed 
   together. Just what in the hell is going on?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Dr. Chandler gives Eleanor the shot and she has a flashback, showing 
   her and Peter making love on the grounds of his mansion, but then 
   Peter morphs into Ranko and she tries to run away, only to be grabbed 
   by the black glove wearing Ranko and he won't let go of her. She is 
   then tied spread-eagle in a doorway, while Ranko traces his 
   switchblade over her body (Eleanor says, &quot;Peter...help me...he 
   has a knife! He wants to kill me! The knife!). Ranko then tears her 
   clothes off and rape is implied (although we do not see the deed). We 
   then find out from Dorothy that Peter died in a terrible car accident 
   and Eleanor suffered a major trauma. Dr. Chandler explains that when 
   Peter died five years ago, he was the love of Eleanor's life, so she 
   wiped his death from her memory and by doing this, she also wiped 
   everything else from her memory from the last five years of her life. 
   Now, I don't know about you, but at this time I am asking myself what 
   Eleanor was doing on a ferry all by herself and also where was she 
   before she got on the ferry? George tells Dr. Chandler that Eleanor 
   went to London last Thursday to appear on a TV show and she was 
   perfectly normal then. He also phoned her while she was in London and 
   she seemed perfectly fine. Dr. Chandler tells George that Eleanor is 
   in a state of chronic anxiety verging on paranoia, but her fear of 
   being murdered may also have a basis in reality. It is possible 
   someone wants to kill her, explains Dr. Chandler to George. So what 
   happened to Eleanor in the past five days? Enquiring minds need to know!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Now is the time to drop a major clue: Dr. Chandler tells George that 
   he didn't know Peter, but he treated his mother, Eleanor. He was 
   called to treat her, before she died. George says, &quot;It's 
   weird...and strange to think...that if Eleanor married Peter, she 
   would have been the second Eleanor Vervoort.&quot; Let that sink in 
   for a couple of minutes. I'll wait...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Okay, ready? When Dr. Chandler goes to check up on Eleanor, he 
   discovers she is not in her room and has left the clinic. She shows 
   up at a rehearsal of &quot;Lady Godiva&quot;, a play she is to star 
   in, surprising Dorothy and Thomas (who are lovers), but she acts as 
   if nothing is wrong. Even catching sight of Ranko at the theater 
   doesn't faze her at all. So, is losing her memory only a trick that 
   has some unknown purpose? Peter's older sister, Margaret (Rossella 
   Falk; <B><A HREF="#BlackBellyTarantula">BLACK BELLY OF THE TARANTULA</A></B> 
   - 1971), who is financing the play, thinks so, telling Thomas, 
   Dorothy and George over dinner that she thinks Eleanor is faking. 
   Apparently not, for when Eleanor walks out of the theater, she sees a 
   dwarf dressed as a jester and his face keeps changing from Peter to 
   Ranko to Midget, over and over again (a well done scene).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Yes, it turns out Eleanor is not faking it at all, remembering bits 
   and pieces from the last five years, such as she and Thomas were 
   having an affair behind George's back. In the film's best 
   &quot;gotcha!&quot; sequence, we see Eleanor getting stabbed in the 
   stomach by Thomas and just before she dies, she shoots Thomas in the 
   head, only then we see it's the final act of a play they both 
   appeared in previously. Another &quot;gotcha&quot; scene finds Ranko 
   sneaking into Eleanor's dressing room and stabbing her to death with 
   his switchblade, only to discover that he killed Eleanor's understudy 
   instead. Just when you think you know how it's going to end (the 
   person who hired Ranko is so obvious, even a blind man could see it), 
   the film throws in a final twist you'll never see coming. It's nasty, 
   but well worth staying until the end for (there is actually a double 
   twist ending!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    keeps the audience guessing, which films like this are supposed to 
   do (but the person who hired Ranko is very obvious). Like I said 
   previously, this is not technically a giallo film, even though it 
   contains some giallo elements, such as a black-gloved killer, lots of 
   the killer's POV shots, seeing only the killer's shoes as he stalks 
   his prey, lots of nudity and some graphic violence, so much so that 
   many reference books (such as <B><A HREF="blood_and_black_lace_book.htm">BLOOD
    &amp; BLACK LACE</A></B>) list this as a giallo flick, but let's not 
   nitpick, this is still a decent mystery. If I have complaints about 
   this film, it would be that Anne Heywood's Eleanor is an aggravating 
   person who would get on the nerves on even the most patient viewer, 
   as she does some very stupid things in this film. Another complaint 
   would be is that Telly Savalas doesn't dub his own voice, which is 
   distracting (especially in the Italian language version, which is how 
   I viewed it), but truth be told, he doesn't have very many lines of 
   dialogue to begin with. He is just there to look imposing (even in 
   his underwear!). His &quot;final curtain&quot; death (an alternate 
   title for this film is <B><A HREF="scenes_from_a_murder_1972.htm#Final Curtain">THE
    FINAL CURTAIN</A></B>, so take it both figuratively and literally) 
   is a highlight of the film, and closes the film, but hold on, that's 
   not all! There's a final denouement from the person who hired Ranko 
   that must be heard to be believed. Now I know why I was so confused 
   when I first saw this film on TV. The denouement was totally excised 
   from the film because it didn't adhere to the censor's standard and 
   practices during the time, but nowadays it is hardly an eye-opener. 
   Just think about that: Airing a film without its proper ending! And 
   what Eleanor and the person who did the hiring do next defies 
   description (but it is fitting). The late <A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_3.htm#StelvioCipriani">Stelvio

    WOMAN</A></B> - 1988) and partner Mike (Martin Speer) are assigned 
   to the case and, as the naked bodies begin to pile-up, Vince's life 
   begins to fall apart. Vince is married with a beautiful teenage 
   daughter, but he also has a mistress on the side, college professor

   (John Karlen; <B><A HREF="house_of_dark_shadows_1970.htm">HOUSE OF

   questioned, and dumping her body for Vince to easily find. Vince 
   nearly captures Danny at the community swimming pool where Annie 
   worked, but Danny escapes by nearly running Vince over with his van. 
   Danny is also a master of disguise,<A HREF="killers_delight_1977.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/killer's delight aka dark ride dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="186" HEIGHT="264" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   sometimes pretending to be a long-haired hippy in a floppy hat and 
   other times sporting an afro and fake moustache, which makes 
   discovering Danny's true identity very hard for Vince. Danny then 
   kidnaps, rapes and kills two young girls (he graphically snaps one of 
   the girl's finger and arm, which gives him a sexual thrill) and dumps 
   their clothes, along with a cryptic note, on Vince's front lawn, 
   which his daughter finds. The cat-and-mouse game then begins, as 
   Vince goes to a hypnotist to remember the license plate number of 
   Danny's van. With that knowledge, Vince discovers where Danny lives 
   and illegally breaks into his home to rummage around for evidence. He 
   finds a garage door opener, but finds that strange because Danny 
   doesn't have a garage at his home (he does have a padlocked shed, 
   though). Vince drives down every street in San Francisco clicking the 
   door opener until he finds the garage it belongs to (He's the 
   luckiest SOB in the entire world!). Inside the garage, Vince 
   discovers Danny's van (which has recently been painted green), along 
   with a box containing his disguises and some pictures of his mother. 
   Since Vince discovered all this evidence without a warrant, his boss 
   gives him one week to build a case that will stick in a court of law. 
   Unbelievably, Vince easily talks mistress Carol into helping him 
   capture Danny in the act by pretending to be a lounge singer (!) in 
   Danny's favorite bar, letting him pick her up. Danny is smarter than 
   he looks and quickly sees through the charade almost immediately, 
   which leads to a downbeat ending where both Mike and Carol end up 
   dead by Danny's hands and Vince ends up taking the law into his own 
   hands. So much for a fair trial!&nbsp; This relatively obscure 
   thriller, also known as <B><A HREF="dark_ride_1977.htm">THE DARK RIDE</A></B> 
   and <B>THE SPORT KILLER</B> (I'm still trying to figure that title 
   out, since the closest thing to a sport here are people swimming in a 
   pool), plays and looks just like a 70's TV movie, except with some 
   bursts of graphic violence and nudity. The flat photography (except 
   for a well-done aerial shot of the camera following Danny's van as it 
   crosses the Golden Gate Bridge in the beginning of the film), acting 
   and especially the music scream out 70's Movie Of The Week. Director 
   Jeremy Hoenack (This is his only directorial effort, but he is a 
   well-respected Sound Editor with over 240 films to his credit) really 
   doesn't offer much to the audience, as Marilyn Thoma's screenplay is 
   a bland concoction of serial killer clich&eacute;s (A serial killer 
   with mother issues? Who would of thunk it?), half-baked police 
   procedurals (yet it takes a hypnotist to break the case wide open) 
   and unresolved family drama. The characters are so broadly written, 
   it's hard to give a damn what happens to them and the closing 
   on-screen scrawl is so maddening and unnecessary (I won't give it 
   away here), that you'll want to slap your DVD player in disgust. This 
   is a very minor serial killer flick, so proceed at your own risk. The

   about a week, saying a week is all he will need to solve Alistair's 
   murder. What Michael doesn't know is someone in the hotel's phone 
   operator room is listening to his conversation . Michael tells the 
   Chief he has all of Alistair's personal effects and one name stands 
   out in his little black address book. The last entry in the book is a 
   female named Diana Marquess (Romy; <B><A HREF="vengeance_of_the_zombies_1972.htm">VENGEANCE
    OF THE ZOMBIES</A></B> - 1973), so that is where he will start his 
   investigation. The Chief tells Michael not to get involved, hanging 
   up the phone after telling Michael he expects to see him in London 
   tomorrow afternoon. Someone then slides a note under Michael's hotel 
   room door, so he quickly runs out the door to catch the person who 
   did it, only to meet an elderly woman who says someone robbed her of 
   all her castor oil and fed it to her dog and he is making a 
   &quot;mess&quot; everywhere he goes. Could this be a clue or it it 
   just the ramblings of a senile old woman? Michael then opens the 
   note, which reads, &quot;I'm waiting at the hotel bar - A Friend&quot;
    That &quot;friend&quot; turns out to be French Interpol Agent 
   Jacques Danielle (Luis Gaspar; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Werewolf Shadow">WEREWOLF
    SHADOW</A></B> - 1970), who says, &quot;I felt it was my duty to 
   give you a warning. You're liable to be killed. I found out something 
   about McAndrew's death that might interest you. You must delay your 
   departure to London. If you do that, I will give you the name of the 
   man who killed him.&quot; When Michael insists he tell him the name 
   of the killer immediately, Jacques says he&nbsp; will tell him 
   tomorrow and that he will meet Michael outside the airport near the 
   fence&nbsp; at the south end of the runway. Jacques implores Michael 
   to take him at his word and to pretend to board the airplane, as it 
   is necessary that Inspector Albert thinks he is no longer in Lisbon 
   (I think we all know what that means: Jacques isn't going to live 
   long enough to give Michael the killer's name.). When Jacques leaves 
   the bar, Michael ask the bartender for the bill, only to be told a 
   gentleman already has paid it. When Michael ask the bartender if it 
   was the gentleman he was just with, the bartender says no, it was a 
   client of the hotel and he has never seen him before. The plot thickens...</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next day, we see Alistair's coffin being loaded on the plane and 
   Michael saying goodbye to Inspector Albert and a few of the Interpol 
   agents, pretending to board the plane to London. As the plane takes 
   off, Michael runs to the south end of the runway to meet Jacques and 
   sees a blue car approaching him. Michael asks Jacques for the 
   killer's name, but Jacques tells Michael to quickly get in the car 
   because it is far too dangerous here. We then see a sniper gun down 
   Jacques (Surprise!) and then try to kill Michael, but Michael jumps 
   into the car and begins driving away (using his hands instead of his 
   feet on the gas and brake pedals), while the sniper fires bullet 
   after bullet into the car, which crashes into a ditch and rolls over 
   into a river. The sniper fires one last bullet into the car, causing 
   it to explode. Is this the end of Inspector&nbsp; Michael Lawrence? 
   Don't count on it!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At the morgue, it is revealed that Jacques was killed by a single 
   bullet to his heart (his body was burned nearly beyond recognition by 
   the car explosion), but Agent Olalia tells the other agents he was 
   sure Jacques wasn't alone when he was shot. At that exact moment 
   Michael appears and says he was with Jacques, but he was able to jump 
   out of the car before it rolled into the river and exploded. He tells 
   the agents that someone wanted to get rid of Jacques and him because 
   Jacques had the name of Alistair's killer, but he was killed before 
   he could tell him the name. Michael also tells the agents he has an 
   advantage over the killer. As far as the killer is concerned, Michael 
   is dead, but what if the killer is one of the Interpol agents? Maybe 
   Michael should have kept his fake death a secret?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Michael takes a room in the cheap and sleazy Pensione Hotel on a 
   tip, where the obviously gay hotel manager takes a liking to Michael 
   (&quot;You seem like a nice sort&nbsp; and you're so...tall!&quot;). 
   Michael asks the manager if he knows Diana Marquess and he suddenly 
   gets very nervous and goes to leave, but Michael stops him, saying he 
   knows she has a room here. The manager says he threw her out of the 
   hotel&nbsp; for using her room for prostitution, telling Michael this 
   is not a place for such illegal things (Sure!). The manager says 
   Diana is a tramp (&quot;I know one when I see one.&quot;). Michael 
   shows the manager a photo of Alistair and asks if he ever saw this 
   man with Diana. The manager says no, he would remember such a 
   &quot;beautiful&quot; man if he ever saw him, since he looks like 
   Paul Newman! The manager then asks to see the photo again, saying, 
   yes, he saw this man in the newspaper and he is dead, almost 
   fainting. The manager then tells Michael that Diana will be at the 
   Casone Del' Mosambique and Michael says that their conversation is 
   strictly between them and not to tell anyone else. When the manager 
   leaves Michael's room, he is grabbed from behind by a man dressed in 
   black and wearing (what else?) black gloves, threatening him with a 
   switchblade and saying he will use it if he<A HREF="killer_with_a_thousand_eyes_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/killer with a thousand eyes italy poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   doesn't tell him every detail of the conversation he had with Michael.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Michael goes to the Casone Del' Mosambique, an even sleazier hotel 
   than he is staying in. he knocks on Diana's door&nbsp; and she says 
   it will cost thirty bucks for sex. Michael agrees and enters her 
   room, where the photo of a man is on her mirror (it's the drug dealer 
   Alistair was chasing) and a rubber clown mask is lying on her end 
   table (it's the same mask the killer of Alistair was wearing). Diana 
   makes Michael for a cop, but Michael says he will pay her double if 
   she will answer one simple question: Does she know Alistair McAndrew? 
   Diana begins to act nervous, telling Michael to leave her room or she 
   will scream. Michael grabs her violently and again asks if she knew 
   Alistair. Diana says she never met him, but her boyfriend did. Diana 
   also says that she heard her boyfriend&nbsp; and Alistair talking 
   about money, but what the conversation was about she doesn't know. 
   When Michael asks Diana&nbsp; where he can find her boyfriend, Diana 
   begins to cry, saying he has disappeared and she hasn't seen him for 
   a couple of days, telling Michael that even if she had the Plague, it 
   wouldn't stop her boyfriend from seeing her because they are madly in 
   love. She fears that he may be dead. She also tells Michael that her 
   boyfriend has changed recently, saying, &quot;All he thinks about is 
   money, money, money!&quot; Michael tries to pay her the money he 
   promised, but she doesn't want it, telling him to get out, so he 
   takes the boyfriend's photo, walks out the door and says, &quot;Thanks
    sweetheart.&quot; Diana goes to pack her bags and leave, but she is 
   grabbed by the same person who threatened the manager and he says, 
   &quot;I like the way you handled that ad to show my gratitude, here, 
   take it, you earned it&quot;, handing her a packet of cocaine. Diana 
   looks at it like a junkie would look at their next overdue fix and 
   kisses the man's hand.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Michael returns to his hotel room, only to find it ransacked. Agent 
   DuValliere offers Michael the use of his bachelor pad, so Michael 
   takes him up on his offer. Michael makes himself a a fried egg 
   sandwich (it's the only thing he knows how to cook!) and goes on the 
   terrace to enjoy the night. Someone sneaks into the bachelor pad, but 
   Michael manages to knock their lights out with a single punch. 
   Michael discovers he has knocked out Mrs. Danielle (Susana Taber; <B><A HREF="green_inferno_1972.htm">GREEN
    INFERNO</A></B> - 1972), the wife of the late Jacques Danielle. When 
   she comes to, she tells Michael that someone is threatening her life, 
   so she came here to get Agent DuValliere's help. Michael tells her 
   they are both in the same boat and maybe they can help each other. 
   Mrs. Danielle tells Michael that her husband never talked about his 
   work and says lately their relationship wasn't what it should have 
   been. Michael gives Mrs. Danielle the bedroom while he sleeps on the 
   sofa. We then see the man in black walking up the fire exit with a 
   sniper rifle, across the street from DuValliere's bachelor pad. He 
   shoots at a shadow he sees through the curtains of the pad, killing 
   Mrs. Danielle with a single bullet to her back. Two thugs then break 
   down the door, but Michael gets the upper hand, knocking them both to 
   the floor and running outside, which turns into a small footchase. 
   Michael is saved by Agent Olalia, who pulls up in his fancy sports 
   car, telling Michael to get in. Michael tells him he can identify the 
   two men who kicked in the door, but Agent Olalia says they are 
   probably already out of town and other goons will replace them, 
   telling Michael he is in extreme danger. He also tells Michael that 
   word on the street is three million dollars of drugs has just arrived 
   in Lisbon and the murders of Alistair and Jacques may be tied to it. 
   He then tells Michael that the drugs haven't left for their intended 
   destination yet (probably the U.S.) and a rival crime organization 
   may have gotten their hands on it, Michael asks for a name, any name, 
   that will get him close to the shipment. Agent Olalia tells Michael 
   that Mr. Costa (Eduardo Fajardo; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#EvilEye1975">EVIL
    EYE</A></B> - 1975) might know, but he can't be trusted since he is 
   also a notorious criminal kingpin. He's a Brazilian who has his hands 
   in every criminal enterprise in Lisbon and if he doen't know the 
   location of the drugs, then no one does. Agent Olalia tells Michael 
   that Costa is throwing a party tonight and he has an invitation, 
   giving it to Michael and wishing him good luck.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Both Michael and Olalia visit Mr. Costa's party at his villa (The 
   first time we see Costa, he is wearing black gloves while he is 
   handling a huge hawk!) and Michael discovers he is a collector of 
   rare species of birds. Michael pretends he is &quot;Professor 
   Lawrence&quot;, a professor of mathematics (!), which Mr. Costa knows 
   is a lie. The party turns out to be a cockfight (!) for the rich 
   clients, where Costa's girlfriend, Sarah (Maria Kosti; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DemonWitchChild1974">DEMON
    WITCH CHILD</A></B>), bets on the losing bird and loses big (she's 
   enjoying herself a little too much, as she loves the bloody carnage). 
   At the party, Agent DuValliere tells Michael he is onto something 
   very important and he needs to see him later in the garden by the zoo 
   (Another giallo trope. It amazes me that no one tells anyone the 
   important information without getting killed before spilling the 
   beans!). Michael and Mr. Costa play a game of Chess and he tells 
   Michael he knows he is not a professor of mathematics, he's actually 
   a British undercover agent (a blind man could have seen through that 
   disguise!). Michael fesses up and tells Costa he wants to talk about 
   the drug shipment, but before Costa can say anything, Sarah appears 
   and tells Costa to drive her home. Michael then tells Costa that they 
   will &quot;play another game of Chess&quot; tomorrow. Michael then 
   goes to meet Agent DuValliere in the garden, but we see someone 
   murdering DuValliere by snaring him in a rope trap and gutting him 
   while he hangs upside down. When Michael enters the garden, he is 
   attacked by the same two thugs earlier in the day, forcing Michael to 
   jump in the pond when Sarah joins the two thugs and begin shooting at him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next day, Michael goes to Agent Olalia's house and sees him with 
   Sarah. When Sarah leaves, Olalia tells Michael that Sarah owns a 
   beauty parlor, swearing to Michael that Sarah is clean of any 
   criminal activity. Michael doesn't believe it, so he kidnaps Sarah 
   from her beauty parlor and brings her to a seaside park, where a 
   little boy hands Michael a note and runs away. The note reads, 
   &quot;Call me 76 0667. Will inform you about drug shipment and 
   assassination.&quot; The note is unsigned, but the bigger question 
   remains this: Who would know Michael was bringing Sarah to the park? 
   Michael tells Sarah to stay put while he looks for the little boy. 
   While Michael is looking for the kid, the man in black tosses Sarah 
   off the park's steep cliffs and she falls on the rock below, dead as 
   a doornail (What the fuck is a doornail and why did I mention it?). 
   Okay, I think you know what time it is. It's time to read this review 
   again to discover the identity of the killer. All the clues are here, 
   so it is time to discover how smart ypu are. Do you have what it 
   takes to unmask the killer? I know you do, so to help you, I'll tell 
   you this: After finding Sarah dead, the two thugs get into a car 
   chase with Michael, firing their guns at him while driving across a 
   bridge. Michael finds a machinegun on the backseat of the car he has 
   stolen and shoots a tire out on the thug's car, causing the car to 
   veer off the bridge and explode on the ground below. Inspector Albert 
   arrests Michael for the murder of Sarah and the two thugs, but lets 
   him escape when the car stops at a red light (Michael also steals his 
   gun). Michael is able to get a trace on the phone number on the note 
   and goes to the location, only to end up in a car, with a voice 
   telling him, via police radio, to drive into the back of a panel 
   truck if he wants to know the truth.&nbsp; Michael becomes trapped 
   inside the <A HREF="killer_with_a_thousand_eyes_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/killer with a thousand eyes spain poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>back
    of the moving&nbsp; panel truck. When the truck arrives at its 
   destination (a warehouse), Michael comes face-to-face with the guilty 
   party(s), resulting in a shoot-out where Michael captures the 
   mastermind and makes him take him to the location of the drugs. 
   That's all I'm going to tell you, so all you giallo/mystery fans put 
   on your thinking caps and start deducing!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Warts and all, this is a damn fine giallo film, an Italy/Spain 
   co-production, from director Juan Bosch, who also gave us the minor

   even if it is fairly easy&nbsp; to spot the killer's identity, 
   tossing in explosions, bloody bullet hits, car chases and other 
   carnage. There's also plenty of female eye candy to keep you 
   watching, even though Britt Nicols' role as Susan Merideth ends 
   rather quickly, as we were expecting her to be a love interest for 
   Michael, but it turns out to be nothing but a cameo. Still, this film 
   offers enough bloody excitement to keep the viewer involved and it 
   won't disappoint giallo fanatics, such as myself. It may not be 
   top-tier giallo, but it is still good nonetheless.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   the supernatural is somehow involved in the plot, but when the final 
   denouement is revealed, you'll groan louder than a man who was just 
   kicked directly in the balls. With that being said, this film is 
   still somewhat enjoyable despite itself, thanks to a cast of capable

    After watching a bloody bullfight (where the bull is repeatedly

   Caldwell (Carroll Baker; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BabaYaga1973">BABA
    YAGA</A></B> - 1973) goes to a train station, which is odd, since 
   fifteen years earlier she saw her father and mother killed in a train 
   disaster, which not only made her deathly afraid of trains, it also 
   struck her dumb and she hasn't spoken a word since then. Martha then 
   calls her physician, Dr. Laurent (Alan Scott), and taps on the 
   receiver with a coin to communicate, letting him know she is at a 
   train station. Dr. Laurent is delighted, telling Martha she is indeed 
   getting better. Martha is at the train station with her driver Marcos 
   (Eduardo Fajardo; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#EvilEye1975">EVIL EYE</A></B>

    BLOODSTAINED BUTTERFLY</A></B> - 1971), a popular singer with the 
   voice of an angel, who has just come back from a concert in Brazil. 
   Marcos is a strange imposing man, who drives the pair in the thick 
   fog while wearing sunglasses. He stops the car next to a fog-shrouded 
   cemetery, telling the pair that the engine is overheating and if he 
   keeps driving, the engine will explode (!). He gets out of the car to 
   find some help and a few seconds later, someone peeps in the window, 
   scaring the crap out of Martha and Jenny. A few moments later, Marcos 
   gets back in the car, saying he couldn't find anyone to help him. 
   Jenny asks him to take off his sunglasses, which he does, revealing a 
   huge scar under his left eye. He puts his sunglasses back on and 
   drives the car away, saying to the pair, &quot;The fog can play 
   tricks with the imagination.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Just the way it use to be!&quot; Jenny has brought Uncle Ralph a 
   present from Brazil, an assortment of books on his favorite subjects, 
   zombies, voodoo, demons and Afro-Cuban witches (Jenny says, 
   &quot;There's enough here to rob you of a month's sleep!). Jenny has 
   also brought Martha a gift: a reel-to-reel tape recording of Martha 
   reciting the Alice In Wonderland &quot;Mouse's Tale&quot; when she 
   was thirteen years old. Jenny listens to it for a few seconds and

    At a welcome home party for Jenny, we learn that Martha was on the 
   train that killed her parents and her father threw Martha out of the 
   compartment window just before the disaster happened, saving her life 
   but striking her dumb. Dr. Laurent arrives at the party and 
   congratulates Martha on taking an important first step on her road to 
   recovery. Uncle Ralph introduces the doctor to Jenny (they apparently 
   have never met before) and suddenly the lights go out. Martha then 
   has a flashback to when she saw her parents perish, but it turns out 
   Mrs. Britton turned the lights out to celebrate the birthday of young 
   girl Christina (Rosa M. Rodriguez; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#BloodSpatBride1972">THE

   parents moved back to America and made him her guardian, but he 
   thanks the Lord for Martha, because she spends a lot of time with 
   Christina (&quot;I really couldn't cope without her&quot; says Father 
   Martin about Martha). Somehow, a Snoopy key chain plays an important 
   part in Christina and Martha's relationship, as Martha is supposed to 
   always keep it with her, no matter where she goes (We also see a 
   Donald Duck wind-up toy, the same kind we saw in Lucio Fulci's <B><A HREF="#DontTortureDuck72">DON'T

   purpose. Not so much here.).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When everyone goes home from the party, Jenny is in her bedroom when 
   she hears the sound of glass breaking. She leaves her room to 
   investigate and finds a broken vase on the main floor. She hears more 
   noises in the garage and when she gets there, someone wearing black 
   gloves (what else?) and holding a large knife kills Jenny. The next 
   morning, Mrs. Britton asks Martha if she has seen Jenny, as she 
   knocked on her bedroom door but there was no answer. Martha signs, 
   telling Mrs. Britton that Jenny is probably tired from her trip, but 
   we can see Jenny is dead under the car in the garage, which Marcos 
   has just unlocked. Christina's new kitten runs into the garage and 
   under the car, stepping in a pool of Jenny's blood. When Martha finds 
   blood on the kitten's paws, she knows something is wrong. She finds 
   Jenny's body in the garage and tries to scream, but the silence is 
   deafening. Martha uses the car's horn to alert everyone and we then 
   see police Inspector Duran (Franco Fantasia; Lenzi's <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#GangWarMilan1973">GANG
    WAR IN MILAN</A></B> - 1973) at the house questioning everyone 
   inside, including the guests from the party the night before. Marcos 
   tells the Inspector that he doesn't know what time he parked the car 
   in the garage, but it was late and he immediately went to sleep in 
   the servant's quarters downstairs. He also tells the Inspector that 
   he locked the garage door so no one outside could get in, as only he 
   has the key (implying that someone inside the house killed Jenny). 
   Marcos also says that he saw Dr. Laurent's car parked outside next to 
   the garage in the middle of the night. Dr. Laurent explains that he 
   left his medical bag in the house after the party, but when he came 
   back to the house to retrieve it, all the lights in the house were 
   out, so he drove home. The Inspector says his medical bag should 
   still be in the house and sends his assistant with the doctor to find 
   it. When Dr. Laurent leaves the room, Marcos tells the Inspector that 
   all the lights in the house weren't out, the lights in Mrs. Britton's 
   room were still on and he saw Dr. Laurent looking directly at her 
   window, implying that the doctor and Mrs. Britton are having an 
   affair. It seems Mrs. Britton and the doctor are having regular 
   nocturnal visits, which Mrs. Britton flatly denies. It turns out Dr. 
   Laurent was telling the truth, the Inspector's assistant telling him 
   that the doctor's medical bag was where he said he left it. The 
   Inspector then tells the group that Jenny's death was apparently the 
   work of a &quot;sex maniac&quot;, because last night another young 
   woman was murdered and her body was thrown in a ditch.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At Jenny's funeral, Martha sees someone peeping at her from behind a 
   bush, the same person she and Jenny saw peeping at them through their 
   car window by the cemetery. She alerts the Inspector and he goes to 
   investigate, but all he finds is a strange medallion with the image 
   of a satanic goat's head engraved on one side. The Inspector fears 
   for Martha's life since the other two women were young and 
   fair-haired, just like Martha. Uncle Ralph takes a look at the 
   medallion and says that whoever owned it is obviously a Devil 
   worshipper (&quot;Sometimes evil explodes in unrestrained 
   manifestations.&quot; Huh???). As Uncle Ralph is saying this, Martha 
   looks out the window and sees that Christina's kitten is lying dead 
   on the front lawn, its throat cut.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Jenny's luggage from her trip back from Brazil arrives at the train 
   station and when Martha checks the contents, she finds a framed photo 
   of her and Jenny when she was a pre-teen. It triggers a memory 
   (flashback) when she and Jenny were at a bullfight (the one we saw at 
   the beginning of the film). Martha wanted to leave, but Jenny looks 
   like she is enjoying the bloody show, maybe a little too much. This 
   seems to bother Martha in the present, as she runs out of the train 
   station into the foggy streets (it seems to be foggy all the time!) 
   and ends up in a church, where Christina is sitting alone, telling 
   Martha that her kitten has run away. Dr. Laurent enters the church, 
   telling Martha something the Inspector said didn't seem right to him. 
   The doctor then implies that someone inside the house is the killer.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Inspector finds an abandoned building where it looks like a 
   Black Mass was held, as the walls are painted with satanic symbols 
   (including a goat's head) and there looks to be an altar. He calls 
   Uncle Ralph to come to the building for his expertise on the subject. 
   Ralph finds a black wafer and says that a Black Mass was held there, 
   but only one person was there to perform it. The Inspector tells 
   Ralph to keep a close eye on Martha because he thinks she is in 
   danger. So who is the sex maniac? Could it be loner Woody Mason 
   (Mario Pardo), the man who has been peeping on Martha and admits he's 
   a Devil worshipper (&quot;Worshipping the Devil is not a 
   crime!&quot;)? Could it be the Mayor (Consalvo Dell'Arti; <B><A HREF="killers_are_challenged_1966.htm">KILLERS
    ARE CHALLENGED</A></B> - 1966)? Or Dr. Laurent? How about Uncle 
   Ralph (he is an expert on Black masses after all)? Or could it be 
   Father Martin (a life of celibacy does have its drawbacks)? Is it 
   Marcos? It's highly obvious that all these people are nothing but red 
   herrings (Lenzi has the habit of doing extreme close-ups and camera 
   zooms of their faces to make them look guilty). So who could it be?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Mrs. Britton is then murdered, the only clue at the crime scene is a 
   satanic goat's head painted on a tree with Mrs. Britton's blood. At 
   Mrs. Britton's funeral, Marcos begins to act weird, which doesn't go 
   unnoticed by the Inspector. Dr. Laurent thinks it is best if he and 
   Martha leave town as soon as possible, but he has to delay the trip 
   by a day because he has to treat a patient. That night, Dr. Laurent 
   is attacked by Woody Mason, but before he can do any harm to the 
   doctor, the police show up, scaring Woody away. Uncle Ralph starts 
   having chest pains, so Martha decides to stay to nurse him back to 
   health. And then Christina is murdered. Think you know who the sex 
   maniac is? I have given you all the clues you need to figure it out 
   on your own.&nbsp; Hint: It's not Uncle Ralph. His heart gives out 
   (Or did it? Hmmmm...). The denouement in the film is bound <A HREF="knife_of_ice_1972_foreign_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/knife of ice italy poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>to
    make you throw your remote at the TV screen, so be prepared for a

    As you can read, this is a less-than-satisfying giallo film from 
   director Umberto Lenzi, who co-wrote the screenplay with Luis G. de 
   Blain (screenwriter of the excellent giallo Spaghetti Western <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#KillPokerPlayer1972">KILL
    THE POKER PLAYER</A></B> - 1972). He has definitely done better in 
   this genre (as I mentioned in the beginning of this review), as this 
   isn't much of a mystery at all, a child could figure it out (Maybe I 
   have just seen too many giallo films, but is that even possible? I 
   think not.). If it weren't for the good, silent performance by 
   Carroll Baker, an old hand at the giallo genre, appearing <B><A HREF="sweet_body_of_deborah_1968.htm">THE

   DEADLY STING</A></B> (1973) as well as some of Lenzi's films 
   previously mentioned in this review, this would have been an 
   insufferable 88 minutes. Light on both nudity and graphic violence, 
   two things we depend on in this genre, this film paints every male 
   member, with the exception of Inspector Duran, as the sex maniac, but 
   it is obvious to the viewer that they are all red herrings. Making 
   Woody a Devil worshipper goes nowhere and even when Christina is 
   killed (by an overdose of heroin!), we can see that Lenzi is throwing 
   everything he can at the screen to see what sticks and none of it 
   does. The plot is drier than a burnt piece of toast and the lack of 
   exploitable elements would try the patience of a saint. I have 
   certainly seen worse giallo films, but I expected more from Lenzi, 
   especially since most of his films from this period are so 
   entertaining. Not so with this film. Oh well, not everyone can be on 
   their game 100% of the time. Just go in knowing that you are going to 
   be disappointed with the ending and you may have a good time here. No 
   guarantees, though.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   During the waning days of World War II, the Japanese run an 
   experimental camp called Unit 731, where they use captured Chinese, 
   Korean and Mongolian prisoners of war for sadistic experiments to 
   further the cause of Japanese supremecy. Prisoners are hacked-up, 
   injected with deadly viruses, operated on while still alive and 
   subjected to every perversity imaginable. One female prisoner has her 
   hands frozen with liquid nitrogen and has the skin stripped away 
   exposing the skeleton (a very well-done, if repellent, effect). 
   That&#146;s just the tip of the iceberg (excuse the pun) as much

   This Italian <B><A HREF="last_house_on_the_left2.htm">LAST HOUSE ON

   little else. Three bank robbers, Aldo (Ray Lovelock), Walter (Flavio 
   Andreini) and Nino (Stefano Cedrati), look for a place to hide out 
   when their car conks out after pulling their latest job. They come 
   upon the secluded titled house and burst in, taking Sister Cristina 
   (Florinda Bolkan) and her five young female charges prisoner (As the 
   trio break through the door and make their entrance, Sister Cristina 
   says, &quot;What is this?&quot; To which Nino replies, &quot;This is 
   a gun and it shoots bullets.&quot;). Walter kills the maid with a 
   steam iron for no reason (he's a sadist) and Nino gets stabbed in the 
   leg with a comb when he tries to rape one of the girls in the 
   bathroom. Walter makes all the girls put on their bathing suits and 
   they go to the beach. When one of the girls tries to flag down a 
   passing boat, Walter threatens to push another girl's face into a 
   board full of protruding nails. A short time later, Walter rips off 
   all of Sister Cristina's clothes and makes her do a reverse 
   striptease, forcing her to put on her nun's clothing while dancing to 
   music. Walter and Aldo then rape her in the kitchen. After forcing 
   the girls to watch some strange porno film on TV (a naked white chick 
   dancing around a fully dressed black man), Walter (who, for some 
   reason, is wearing <A HREF="last_house_on_the_beach_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/last house on the beach japan dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="172" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>women's
    makeup on his face) and Nino rape a girl in the living room while 
   Aldo makes Sister Cristina watch (He says to her, &quot;Listen, she's 
   better off losing her cherry than being a dead virgin.&quot;). When a 
   mailman delivers a telegram to Sister Cristina, she slips him a 
   &quot;Help Us&quot; note in his tip. Sister Cristina agrees to tend 
   to Nino's infected leg after Aldo agrees to keep his friends off the 
   girls (a promise he doesn't intend to keep). Aldo tells one of the 
   girls that he is not violent and was only the getaway driver, but a 
   flashback proves the opposite. When one of the girls escapes to get 
   help (and discovers the mailman's dead body, his throat cut from 
   ear-to-ear), Aldo gives chase and catches her at the beach trying to 
   swim away. Aldo brings her back to the house and Nino does something 
   undescribable, killing her. Sister Cristina sees her bloody body and 
   says enough's enough. It's &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; time. She 
   gives Nino a hot shot, pumps three bullets into Walter's head (with 
   Nino's gun) and plays a short game of cat-and-mouse with Aldo. He 
   tries to sweet-talk his way out, but the girls gang-up on him, 
   beating him to death with garden tools (after he takes a shotgun 
   blast to the gut), while Sister Cristina watches in horror. Which 
   just proves: Turning the other cheek will just get you raped and 
   beaten. The only true redemption is to act just as bad as your 
   aggressors. Similar in tone to <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Night Train Murders">NIGHT

    OFF</A></B> - 1972; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#GunanKing1982">GUNAN, 
   KING OF THE BARBARIANS</A></B> - 1982), is nothing but a series of 
   physical and mental debasements committed against the women until a 
   breaking point is reached and revenge is taken. I don't know about 
   you, but a little rape goes a long way and this film just seems to 
   wallow in it. There's plenty of nudity present, but none of it is the 
   least bit titillating, because most of the time one type of violence 
   or another is being performed against the women when they are naked. 
   This ultra-misongynistic film has the three men continuously 
   threatening women with guns, punching and kicking them, ripping off 
   their clothes and forcing sex upon them. The nadir comes when Walter 
   rips-off one girl's panties, shoves his fingers between her legs and 
   then declares that she is a virgin. Nino then takes his homemade cane 
   (it's nothing but a big tree branch) and thrusts it up her vagina. 
   This is not entertainment to me, it's filmed torture. It makes no 
   difference if the men get their comeuppance in the end, it's still 85 
   minutes of female depravity followed by a few final minutes of the 
   men getting what they deserve. I've never been a fan of films of this 
   type (I'm not crazy about <B><A HREF="last_house_on_the_left2.htm">LAST
    HOUSE ON THE LEFT</A></B> or <B><A HREF="i_spit_on_your_grave.htm">I

   watching women repeatedly being abused, no matter what the outcome 
   is. Much like what's happening on-screen, this film was sheer torture 
   for me to sit through. Fans of the Rape/Revenge genre will probably

   finger on.<A HREF="madness_1994.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/madness 1994 poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="220" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   It's got gory effects, most of them dealing with eye removal, but we 
   all know that gory effects do not make a good film. It could be 
   because the film has a distinct '80s look and feel to it, its 
   downright nasty tone or the ridiculous costume the killer wears, but 
   I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The plot deals with a female fumetti (comic book) artist named 
   Giovanna Dei (Monica Carpanese, as &quot;Carol Farres&quot;), who 
   writes and&nbsp; illustrates the violent comic book &quot;Doctor 
   Dark&quot;. Someone is copying Doctor Dark's killings directly from 
   the pages of the comic book, as if Doctor Dark (who I will refer to 
   as &quot;DD&quot; in the rest of the review) has come to life.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film opens at a go-cart racetrack, where a group of people are 
   watching the races. A babysitter then notices that her charge, young 
   girl Irma, is missing, so she goes looking for her. She finds Irma's 
   toy raygun on the floor of a garage, but when she picks it up, she is 
   assaulted by someone dressed as DD. The killer pulls out a 
   two-pronged weapon and uses it to remove the babysitter's eyes (shown 
   in extreme close-up). DD then breaks a bottle and shoves two shards 
   of glass into the babysitter's empty eye sockets and poses her body 
   for all to see.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Giovanna at a press conference, explaining to the 
   audience that the fictional DD is a character with a split 
   personality. By day he is a professor of Pagan religion and by night 
   he is a bloodthirsty serial killer. She then says that the theme of 
   split personalities dates back to the time of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde 
   and that her comic book follows that line. A female member of the 
   audience stands up and asks Giovanna how she replies to accusations 
   that her comic book has a negative effect on its readers (Does this 
   sound familiar?). Giovanna says that kids really like DD and it sells 
   very well (Not the best answer to give a room full of reporters!). 
   She also says that those who accuse it of unnecessary violence forget 
   that the real violence is dealt out to us every day on TV (Okay, now 
   she's being insulting to her audience, passing the blame to 
   television). A male reporter in the audience, Lorenzo Calligari 
   (Fausto Lombardi; <B><A HREF="#TerrorExpress1979">TERROR EXPRESS</A></B> 
   - 1979), stands up and says to Giovanna that there's a maniac out 
   there killing babysitters using the same methods described in her 
   comic book. He says DD is not only a negative influence, but her 
   comic book is dangerous. Giovanna slaps her hands on the table and 
   says it has not been proven that the murders emulate her comic book 
   and it's nothing but a case of &quot;Press hype&quot;. Lorenzo says 
   her comic book emulates the fantasies of certain sick individuals and 
   the audience applauds loudly. Nico Vannelli (Gabriele Gori; <B><A HREF="bronx_executioner_1989.htm">THE
    BRONX EXECUTIONER</A></B> - 1989), a co-writer of the comic book who 
   is sitting next to Giovanna, stands up and defends Giovanna, telling 
   the audience that sick individuals existed long before he and 
   Giovanna created DD. Lorenzo says if it were up to him, he would burn 
   all this &quot;violent sub-cultural trash&quot; and the audience 
   roars in agreement (If a real-life reporter ever said this in a Press 
   conference, he would lose his job and not be able to find a new one. 
   At least that is how it use to be before 2016, but that will be my 
   only political statement!). Another man sitting on the opposite side 
   of Giovanna, Marzio Mannino (Achille Brugnini, as &quot;Anthony 
   Berner&quot;; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Ark Sun God">THE ARK OF THE SUN GOD</A></B> 
   - 1983), tells the audience to please quiet down. He is the publisher 
   of DD and he called this Press conference to discuss the crimes. He 
   tells the audience that he is deeply saddened and hopes the killer is 
   caught as soon as possible, but he has no plans of discontinuing DD 
   and it will continue to be published on its normal schedule. He warns 
   the audience not to be too hasty incriminating the mass media or we 
   all run the risk of &quot;moral lynching.&quot; (Something that has 
   become so popular in our society today, it scares me). After the 
   Press conference is over, Marzio asks secretary Amy (Emy Valentino; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Phantom Death">PHANTOM
    OF DEATH</A></B> - 1987) to arrange a meeting with Lorenzo 
   Calligari, because he wants to get him on &quot;our side&quot;. Amy 
   says it won't be easy because he is the type of person who can turn 
   the Press against them, but Marzio doesn't listen, kissing Amy on the 
   forehead, telling her that her perfume is driving him crazy and that 
   he needs to see her tonight, but Amy tells him she's busy tonight and 
   every other night. Even though everyone in the audience cheered 
   Lorenzo, there is a line of people waiting for Giovanna to sign their 
   copies of DD! One such person is Amedeo Callistrati (Antonio Zequila; <B><A HREF="violent_shit_the_movie_2015.htm">VIOLENT
    SHIT: THE MOVIE</A></B> - 2015), who tells Giovanna that the signed 
   copy is not for him, it's for his fifteen-year-old nephew, who loves 
   the comic book. He tells Giovanna that he wants to have a word with 
   her, but she tells him the conference is over. He then shows her his 
   badge, revealing that he is a police detective and Giovanna says to 
   him sarcastically, &quot;Did you come to arrest me or did you come 
   for the murderer's address?&quot; He says he just wants to ask her a 
   couple of questions about &quot;her&quot; DD and she says, &quot;If 
   they killed someone with an electric drill do you take it out on 
   Black &amp; Decker?&quot; (Totally ripping off Anthony Franciosa's 
   &quot;Smith &amp; Wesson&quot; remark in <B><A HREF="tenebre_1982.htm">TENEBRE</A></B>!).
    Detective Calligari looks at Giovanna, not amused, and tells her she 
   will be hearing from him shortly. We have met all the major players 
   in this film, except for one, and any one of them could be the 
   killer, but the question still remains: Why does DD only kill 
   babysitters? Was it a childhood trauma or another more recent reason?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Nico wants DD to die because he heard a rumor that Marzio is going 
   to discontinue the comic book, but Giovanna says no way, it is her 
   baby and she is not going to kill him off. When Giovanna gets back to 
   her office, there is a message on her answering machine from Marzio, 
   telling her the Press conference was great publicity, so hurry up and 
   finish her illustrations for the next issue, because he wants to 
   publish it while the iron is hot. The next message on her machine is 
   from the killer, who makes nonsensical remarks about eyes and then 
   hangs up. Giovanna thinks it is Nico playing a trick on her, that is 
   until she goes to get something to eat and finds two human eyeballs 
   pinned to one of her illustrations. They are the eyes belonging to 
   the babysitter at the racetrack, the cadaver of whom Detective 
   Callistrati is examining at the morgue with the coroner. The 
   Detective looks at the eyeless body and says, &quot;Oh, my God!&quot;,
    turning his head away. The coroner says he thought the detective 
   would be use to seeing such things, Callistrati telling him, &quot;In 
   the movies, doctor, that happens only in the movies.&quot; The 
   coroner notices that the babysitter's body is missing a pinky finger 
   on her left hand, but it is not a recent wound, rather something that 
   happened a long time ago. The coroner also discovers that after the 
   killer removed the babysitter's eyes, the DD copycat then shoved a 
   stiletto up her nose and into her brain, just like the ancient 
   Egyptians once did before they mummified bodies. Detective 
   Callistrati pulls Giovanna and Nico into his office, telling them 
   that it is no longer a case of &quot;Press hype&quot; because DD did 
   the same exact thing to his victim in the latest issue. The comic 
   even goes as far to show the victim missing a pinky finger on her 
   left hand and it's too unusual and brutal to call it a coincidence. 
   He tells Giovanna that she has to cooperate now; the killer may have 
   sent her the eyes of the latest victim because he/she wants to make 
   contact directly with her. Maybe the killer is a fan, Detective 
   Callistrati asking Giovanna if she can remember anyone she came in 
   contact with at a book signing that struck her as odd; even the most 
   insignificant of things could break the case. Giovanna says no, she 
   can't think of anyone, but last night there was a car parked in front 
   of her building and she got the feeling that someone was spying on 
   her. She did not see what kind of car it was or write down the plates 
   because it was dark, telling the Detective it looked like a van. Nico 
   interrupts and says the best thing for Giovanna is to get away for a 
   while, saying that it is not safe for her to be around and he can 
   give the detective all the information he needs. Detective 
   Callistrati says that's a terrible idea, it was Giovanna who created 
   DD, therefore she and Nico are on call, telling them that's all for now.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Giovanna goes back to her office and the doorbell rings. Thinking 
   that it is Amy, she yells out that the door is open and to come in, 
   only it isn't Amy, it's Lorenzo. He is holding a bouquet of flowers, 
   which he gives to Giovanna, and he apologizes for his behavior at the 
   Press conference, saying, &quot;That's just the way I am when I get 
   really enthusiastic about something.&quot; Even though he detests her 
   comic book. He's really fascinated with the symbolism of the comic, 
   describing DD as &quot;the obscure side of the human being.&quot; 
   Giovanna asks him how he knew where she lived and he tells her Marzio 
   told him. He wants to interview her and she says no, she is going 
   away for a while. Amy appears and, against Detective Callistrati's 
   orders, takes Giovanna to a country villa in the middle of nowhere. A 
   perfect place for DD to stalk her, as we see someone in a van 
   watching Giovanna entering her new getaway.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    DD is too busy at the moment, as we see the copycat kill a young 
   babysitter in the same town as Giovanna's country villa, as DD 
   injects her in the neck with something. We don't see DD kill the 
   young girl, but Giovanna gets another phone call from the killer 
   letting her know he/she knows where she lives. It turns out DD was in 
   her country villa, leaving the latest victim's eyes in a dish for 
   Giovanna to find. Right after she finds the eyes, Giovanna sees DD in 
   the house, so she runs into the bedroom and locks the door. Nico 
   shows up and gets into a fight with DD and when it looks like Nico 
   will be stabbed in the chest with a knife, a shot rings out and DD 
   falls to the ground. It was Detective Callistrati who fired the shot 
   and he pulls the mask off DD, revealing it to be Lorenzo Calligari, 
   who says, &quot;I loved them all! They were all so beautiful. They're 
   all mine!&quot; (in some of the worst acting you'll ever lay eyes or 
   ears on!). The Detective and his partner search Lorenzo's home (Why 
   do they kick down the door down with weapons drawn when Lorenzo is 
   already in custody?) and find a hidden room containing a doll that 
   looks like it was charred in a fire. When the Detective picks the 
   doll up, it begins to talk gibberish and he looks at his partner like 
   they just found an important clue (Maybe they heard something I 
   didn't?). Detective Calligari goes on TV and says this about Lorenzo 
   Calligari: &quot;We could be dealing with a crank and not a 
   killer.&quot; (Maybe that doll did tell him something!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After getting drunk on champagne while celebrating on Marzio's 
   yacht, Giovanna meets Nico's friend, Massimo (Carlo Granchi, as 
   &quot;Carl Graham&quot;), the yacht's skipper, and she and Nico go 
   back to the country villa to make love. Giovanna has a nightmare that 
   DD kills her in bed and she wakes up screaming (Whoops! I was wrong. 
   This is the worst acting you will ever see!). Nico tries to comfort 
   her and gets up to get her some warm milk, but he finds something 
   written on a Post-It note that gets his attention. Detective 
   Callistrati reads Lorenzo's statement and sees something that catches 
   his eye. Marzio calls Giovanna and all he gets is her answering 
   machine, but why does he have DD's two-pronged weapon on his desk? 
   Detective Callistrati goes to talk to Lorenzo, only to discover from 
   his doctor that Lorenzo is in a state of deep catatonia, something he 
   will never recover from, his condition being irreversible. He then 
   talks to Giovanna, telling her that he thinks Lorenzo wasn't DD, he's 
   only a<A HREF="madness_1994.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/madness 1994 italy poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="213" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   crank. Nico sets up Giovanna with a new temporary home, a place 
   Massimo owns and rents out. Marzio phones Amy and tells her to stay 
   in the office because they are going to pull an all-nighter and he'll 
   be right there. A short time later, Amy hears the front door open, 
   only it's not Marzio, it's DD. Amy pulls the mask off DD and gives a 
   surprised look (we don't see who it is). DD gives Amy a heroin 
   hotshot and makes it look like she is DD; typing a confession letter 
   and making it seem like she committed suicide (Amy is such a tiny 
   woman, you would have to be braindead to believe she is DD!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    By this time, it's not too hard to figure out who is really Doctor 
   Dark. At this point in the film, it's so obvious, it's ridiculous. 
   It's not so much of a whodunit, but a whyhe/shedidit. Monica 
   Carpanese is such a bad actress (especially during her frequent 
   crying and screaming jags), it's hard to care whether she lives or 
   dies. Even when she's nude and making love to Nico, she's a terrible 
   actress! It also doesn't help that the English dubbing is especially 
   rote, as the dubbers talk in halting, monotone sentences, even when 
   Giovanna has one of her crying jags. And let's talk about Doctor 
   Dark's look for a moment. He is dressed all in black, complete with a 
   black fedora, but it's the <A HREF="madness_1994.htm#DoctorDark">mask 
   that's highly unusual</A>. Instead of zipping up in the back, it has 
   a long zipper in the front, going straight up the middle of the face 
   of the person wearing it! It not only looks uncomfortable, but it 
   must be extremely painful should anyone pull it off his or her face, 
   which happens twice in this film. But somehow, all these negative 
   aspects gel together and makes for an entertaining 83 minutes. The 
   generic slasher screenplay, by Lorenzo De Luca (<B><A HREF="jonathan_of_the_bears_1994.htm">JONATHAN
    OF THE BEARS</A></B> - 1994), steals directly from the films I 
   mentioned in the beginning of this review, as well as many others, 
   and we should be insulted, but for reason I still can't explain, it 
   didn't bother me in the least. Bruno Mattei was one of the very few 
   Italian genre film directors that worked constantly throughout the 
   '80s, '90s &amp; the New Millennium, right up to his death in 2007, 
   giving us such &quot;classic&quot; films as <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HellLivingDead1980">HELL

    Oh yeah, in case you haven't guessed by now, Giovanna was Doctor 
   Dark. Her babysitter always locked her in a closet when she was a

    MANIAC RESPONSIBLE</A><A NAME="ManiacResponsible"></A> (1975) -</B> 
   Underage schoolgirl Fiorella Ricardi (Adrianna Falco) has secret 
   plans one night, so she has one of her female friends cover for her 
   while she does whatever she does, but when she doesn't return home, 
   her over-protective father, Professor Ricardi (Gabriele Ferzetti), 
   uses his considerable influence to get the police immediately 
   involved in looking for her. Police detective Fernando Soni (Antonio 
   Sabato) and his female partner, Giovanna Nunzianti (Luciana Paluzzi), 
   are assigned to the case and after interviewing the Professor and his 
   wife, Emila (Bedy Moratti), and searching Fiorella's bedroom, they 
   are certain of two things: 1) The Professor has plenty of &quot;dirty 
   money&quot; he is hiding from his wife. 2) Fiorella is hiding a lot 
   of her activities from her parents. Since Fiorella left that night on 
   her motor scooter and scooters need gas, Detective Soni has his men 
   check all the gas stations. They find out that Fiorella stopped at a 
   couple of stations and was making a long trip out of town. But where 
   would a sixteen year-old girl be going with no money and a bathing 
   suit (two clues that Detective Nunzianti discovered when searching 
   Fiorella's bedroom)? Detective Soni has a severe distrust for people 
   like the Professor, who is <A HREF="maniac_responsible_1975.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/maniac responsible dvd front2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>a
    surgeon (Soni hates doctors ever since he and his wife were in a bad 
   automobile accident and had to wait four hours for a doctor, which 
   resulted in his wife's death), but he still starts an earnest search 
   for Fiorella, using police dogs at a lake near the route that 
   Fiorella was traveling on her scooter. The dogs find evidence that 
   Fiorella was there, including blood, hashish and tire tracks from a 
   car. When they drag the lake, they find Fiorella's body tied to the 
   motor scooter, a bullet in the back of her neck. An autopsy reveals 
   that she was three months pregnant and Detective Soni immediately 
   becomes suspicious of the Professor's clinic, which seems to dole out 
   substandard care while the Professor and his partners get rich off 
   the profits. Detective Soni is hampered in his investigation by a 
   political system that would rather see this case swept under the rug, 
   but Soni continues on his quest to find the truth. It will lead him 
   to opposition at every clue he finds (even from his own Chief, who is 
   being pressured to whitewash the case). He discovers an underage 
   prostitution/blackmail ring, a bunch of unsavory characters and 
   corruption that leads up to the top rung of the Italian political 
   ladder. When Soni gets too close to discovering the truth of 
   Fiorella's murder, someone begins murdering all those that could help 
   him solve the case. That doesn't stop him, though, as Soni catches 
   the murderer. The reason why he he killed Fiorella? Simple. In the 
   murderer's own words: &quot;It was her fault. She was a 
   slut!&quot;&nbsp; This murder mystery/police procedural, directed by 
   Mario Caiano (<B><A HREF="#EyeInTheLabyrinth">EYE IN THE LABRYNTH</A></B> 
   - 1972; <B><A HREF="nazi_love_camp_27_1977.htm">NAZI LOVE CAMP 27</A></B> 
   - 1977), paints a dim view of the Italian political system, doctors 
   and health care. What's most interesting about this film is that for 
   all the pressure put on detectives Sona and Nunziante to fail in 
   their investigation, they both soldier-on in their quest to find out 
   the truth, thanks to Soni's severe disgust of doctors (he views this 
   case as a way to avenge his wife's death) and Nunziante's unwavering 
   devotion to her partner. Antonio Sabato (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#GangWarMilan1973">GANG
    WAR IN MILAN</A></B> - 1973; <B><A HREF="war_of_the_robots_1978.htm">WAR
    OF THE ROBOTS</A></B> - 1978) is terrific as Detective Soni, who 
   seethes every time he has to deal with the privileged in society, 
   knowing that their money and influence can buy them the kind of 
   justice and attention that his wife was denied. His intensity and 
   fury shines bright in every scene he's in, even in this dupey, 
   third-generation copy that I viewed. While the violence is minimal, 
   there are shocking scenes of full frontal nudity, especially 
   Fiorella's body laying naked on a morgue slab, an illegal abortion 
   being performed in the Professor's clinic and the murder of an 
   underage prostitute while she is taking a bath. Since this film was 
   made before the advent of DNA testing, the police procedural portions 
   use blood evidence and spended bullets to crack the case. It may seem 
   dated, but that's how it was done back then. The final third of the 
   film turns into a mini-giallo, as some unknown killer (POV shots) 
   begins dispatching people (scapel to the throat, strangulations, 
   etc.) to stop them from talking to Soni. It's a strange hybrid of a 
   film, but the performance of Antonio Sabato elevates this from the 
   unusual to the must-see. Politics, prostitution and murder were never 
   more entertaining. Shot as <B><A HREF="calling_all_police_cars_1975.htm#ItalyTitle">...A

    MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW</A><A NAME="MidnightHorrShow14"></A> (2014) -</B> 
   First of all, I am appalled about how many torrent sites have this 
   movie to download for free (it is only available on streaming 
   services and not available on U.S. DVD yet and is available on 
   British DVD under the title <B><A HREF="theatre_of_fear_2014.htm">THEATRE
    OF FEAR</A></B>). I got to see it streaming for free because I am a 
   member of Amazon Prime, but all the free downloads by these 
   underhanded, sleazy torrent sites guarantee it will not be available 
   on U.S. DVD. And there's the shame. There's an underground sensation 
   in South Wales called The Midnight Horror Show that precious few 
   people get invited to (and there's a reason for that). It's like a 
   circus with a <A HREF="midnight_horror_show_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/midnight horror show dvd front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>little
    something evil added. It is run and performed by the Moreau family. 
   The Master of Ceremonies is Dr. Deimos Moreau (Jared Morgan) and his 
   son Janus (Lee Bane) is a ventriloquist, son Apollo (Sam Harding) is 
   a magician, son Trinculo (Nathan Head) is a creepy clown and daughter 
   Venus (Shireen Ashton) is a stripper. They put performances on in 
   little out-of-the-way theaters and the show is killer. Literally. 
   Apollo picks audience member Angela (Sarah Louise Madison) to be part 
   of a magic trick where she is locked in a box and he thrusts several 
   bladed weapons through it. The audience gasps, but when Apollo opens 
   the box, Angela is not there. She is actually backstage tied to a 
   table next to a variety of sharp medical instruments. Deimos is 
   running a scalpel over her body, asking her, &quot;Do you believe in 
   God?&quot; Angela replies, &quot;No!&quot; and Deimos says a bunch of 
   biblical things, ending with &quot;Vengeance is mine!&quot;, picks up 
   a bone saw and we hear Angela scream. Angela's boyfriend Kevin (Scott 
   Suter) searches the theater's backstage when she doesn't answer her 
   cellphone and he discovers Angela all cut to pieces and screams. The 
   Moreau family is already gone, taking their trailer caravan on the 
   road and finding a place to park for the night. Deimos is arguing 
   with his son Apollo for saying the word &quot;fuck&quot;. Deimos is 
   very religious and won't accept bad language or blasphemy from anyone 
   living in his caravan. Janus is quite mad and imagines that his dummy 
   talks back to him, so he locks the dummy in a trunk every night. 
   Trinculo is covered in burns from head to toe when he was in a bar, 
   someone hit him over the head with a full bottle of whiskey and 
   someone else lit a match. He uses the clown makeup to cover his 
   scars. Venus is obviously Deimos' favorite sibling, as he tries to 
   educate her how long it takes a body to start to decompose (4 to 6 
   days, if you are interested). Deimos loves to pick on Apollo because 
   he seems to be the most independent member of the group. Deimos has 
   Apollo and Venus carry plastic bags of Angela's body parts (they seem 
   to be cannibals) to the local river and throw them in, but when 
   Apollo throws a briefcase in the river, Deimos makes him jump in and 
   get it because their mother gave it to him (Both Deimos and Venus 
   laugh as Apollo is in the water). Yes, the Moreau family is extremely 
   screwed-up. An entertainment agent called Milton Katzenberg (Victor 
   Ptak) taps Janus on the shoulder and tells him he saw him at the last 
   show (at midnight, naturally) and thinks he has enough talent to make 
   it big, but he's going to have to leave his family. He gives Janus 
   his business card and tells him to call soon; the offer has an 
   expiration date. At breakfast, Deimos tells his family how Hitler 
   loved to go to the circus and would always send flowers to the women 
   backstage. Janus' dummy tells him how his entire family is dragging 
   him down and it is time to cut the cord, so he calls Mr. Katzenberg 
   and signs a contract behind his family's back. Trinculo is walking in 
   a park (in white makeup) when he sees a couple arguing and watches in 
   horror as the man Vincent (Kristen Richards) hits the woman Jenny 
   (Tiffany Ceri). He walks up to Vincent and knocks his lights out when 
   he makes a balloon animal joke. Jenny leaves with Trinculo and he 
   tells her that she's too good for him. Trinculo and Jenny make a 
   coffee date for the next day. Katzenberg gets Janus an audition with 
   talent scouts faster than he thought he could and the dummy purposely 
   sabotages the audition by making pedophilia jokes and other things 
   that shouldn't be said out loud, so Katzenberg drops him as a client. 
   The next day at the coffee shop, Jenny asks Trinculo how he got his 
   burns and he tells her the whole sordid story. Jenny doesn't seem to 
   mind the way he looks, which is probably the first time since the 
   &quot;accident&quot; that a woman has pays any attention to him. 
   After the audition, the dummy wants Janus to kill Katzenberg and make 
   it bloody. If he doesn't do it, the dummy swears he will. Janus locks 
   the dummy in his box. A man named Mr. Goldberg (Nigel Streeter) hires 
   hitman Duke (Kevin Horsham) and tells him how his daughter ended up 
   missing after attending one of The Midnight Horror Shows. He not only 
   wants Duke to find out who is responsible, he wants them dead. We 
   then see Janus kill Katzenberg with a rope around his neck and gets 
   to kill his wife (Linda Bailey), too, when she comes to investigate 
   the noise. Duke gets the goods on the Moreau family (they all have 
   police records) and finds the location of the next show. Trinculo 
   goes to Jenny's apartment to ask her out on a date, but she sees him 
   kiss Vincent at the door, so he follows Vincent back to his apartment 
   and kills him. Janus is cutting up the Katzenbergs in the bathtub 
   with a saw (The dummy sings, &quot;Janus, Janus. He loves to take it 
   up the anus!&quot;). Janus then goes home and now has the voice of 
   the dummy permanently. Trinculo waits in Jenny's apartment and when 
   he turns the lights on, he is wearing the skinned face of Vincent. 
   Jenny goes to call the police, but Trinculo knocks it out of her 
   hands. He hands her a knife and tells her to kill him; that everyone 
   has a murderer deep inside them, but Jenny refuses and Trinculo kills 
   her. Janus shows his father his true colors and he likes it. Duke 
   hires Gunner (Kenton Hall) and The Reaper (Gypsy Lee Pistolero) to 
   help him kill the Moreaus. Duke will take care of Deimos and Venus, 
   while they can have the other three to do<A HREF="theatre_of_fear_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/theatre of fear aka the midnight horror show british dvd front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   with as they please, as long as they end up dead. Duke now has Venus 
   tied up in the trunk of his car and hammers nails into Diemos' hands 
   into a wooden chair. One of two of Duke's associates has some fun 
   with Janus and Trinculo with some good old-fashioned whipping as they 
   are tied to their stomachs on tables. The other associate has Apollo 
   padlocked to a table and begins drowning him in a Tupperware bowl 
   full of water, but pulls his head up before he passes out. The two 
   associates go outside for a smoke break. Big mistake. When they come 
   back, Apollo has picked the padlock (he is a magician, after all) and 
   kills Duke's associate. Apollo then stabs to death Duke's other 
   associate and saves his brothers. Apollo cuts Venus free and they go 
   to save their father. Duke has a gun to Deimos's head, but I guess he 
   forgot that Venus was an expert knife thrower. She throws a knife and 
   hits Duke in the upper chest. The kids remove the nails from their 
   father's hands, but Duke isn't quite dead yet and shoots Deimos in 
   the back, killing him. Apollo viciously stabs Duke over and over with 
   the knife. On Deimos' dying breath, he says there is nothing more 
   important than family. We are then at The Midnight Horror Show and 
   new Master of Ceremonies Apollo introduces the show to the small 
   audience. The show must go on!&nbsp; The first thing you will notice 
   after watching this movie is that director/producer/screenwriter 
   Andrew Jones (<B><A HREF="amityville_asylum_2013.htm">THE AMITYVILLE ASYLUM</A></B> 
   - 2013; <B><A HREF="last_house_on_cemetery_lane_2015.htm">THE LAST 
   HOUSE ON CEMETERY LANE</A></B> - 2015; <B><A HREF="robert_the_doll_2015.htm">ROBERT
    [THE DOLL]</A></B> - 2015) shows precious little of the actual 
   Midnight Horror Show, just part of Apollo's magic act. Those 
   expecting a gore-a-thon are bound to be disappointed (although there 
   are scenes that go way past what we consider good taste). Jones is 
   more interested in showing the Moreaus as a family unit, even though 
   they are all murderers. Even murderers have families and some of them 
   act better than normal families (if you ignore the murders, that is). 
   Everyone wants to be accepted and we actually feel sorry for Trinculo 
   when we see Jenny kiss Vincent or when the dummy makes fun of Janus 
   (although it is funny sometimes). Apollo seems to be the most 
   picked-on by his family, but it is him who comes through in the end. 
   Why? Because they are family. We are also shown that some 
   &quot;normal&quot; people can act worse than the murderers, such as 
   Duke and his two associates, who seem to get off on inflicting pain 
   and are monsters of their own choosing. Go into this film with an 
   open mind (it's more a psychological thriller than a horror film) and 
   this may hit your sweet spot. A lot of good DTV films are coming from 
   across the pond because they think differently (we also think 
   somewhat the same, but would never consider making a film like this 
   without there being a ton of gore and less family values). I 
   recommend this film whole-heartedly because this is not your typical 
   genre film. It actually has something to say. The creepy opening and 
   closing song was sung by Bobby Cole (who composes most of the music 
   for Andrew Jones' films). I'm going to watch Jones' other films to 
   see if they are as good as this one. Also starring Ritchie Bessart, 
   Shane Price, Kevin Foster and Robert Graham. No U.S. DVD or Blu-Ray 
   distributor at the time of this review. <B>Not Rated</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

    them up (one is a woman and another guy has his face cut-up with a 
   razor), ties the trio together, puts sticks of dynamite between their 
   bodies, lights the fuse and blows their bodies to bits in a ravine 
   located somewhere in the mountains. Four years pass and Ugo Piazza 
   (Gastone Moschin) is released from prison. Ugo, who is a small-time 
   crook, is picked-up by Rocco and worked over pretty good by Rocco's 
   goons. Rocco believes Ugo is involved in the $300,000 theft and had 
   himself intentionally thrown in prison on a trumped-up charge to hide 
   out until the heat died down. The only problem is, the Mikado never 
   forgets and he has Rocco repeatedly harass and abuse Ugo, even though 
   he denies having anything to do with the theft. Complicating matters 
   for Ugo are the Police Commissioner (Frank Wolff) and his right-hand 
   man Fonzino (Luigi Pistilli), who want Ugo to help them put the 
   Mikado in prison. Ugo is a man of honor and refuses to help them, 
   even though Rocco makes his life miserable on a daily basis. Ugo goes 
   to Kino (Philippe Leroy), his old partner in crime, to help him get 
   the Mikado off his back and Kino tells him to go see the Mikado in 
   person and try to work things out (During Ugo's meeting with Kino, 
   Rocco breaks into the apartment and Kino and Ugo beat the crap out of 
   Rocco, shaming him in front of his men). Ugo goes to talk to the 
   Mikado and, even though doesn't believe Ugo wasn't involved in the 
   theft of his money, he gives him a job as one of Rocco's muscle (He 
   tells Ugo that Rocco can decide at any time whether he lives or 
   dies). Ugo visits old girlfriend Nellie (Barbara Bouchet) and they 
   pick up where they left off before he was sent to prison (She still 
   believes he stole the Mikado's money). When the Mikado and Rocco try 
   to blow-up Ugo in a phony package pick-up (the package is a bomb), 
   Ugo gets wise and joins forces with Kino when the Mikado has their 
   blind friend, Don Vincenzo (Ivo Garrani), killed. Ugo plays the 
   Mikado against Rocco when he gets the Mikado to believe a story that 
   Rocco may have stolen the $300,000 himself. As tensions between the 
   Mikado and Rocco develop, Kino does a one-man raid on the Mikado's 
   compound, which results in the death of the Mikado and many of his 
   men, but Kino loses his life in the process. The finale is a tense, 
   well-structured face-off between Ugo and Rocco at a<A HREF="milano_calibre_9_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/milano calibre 9 greek vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="232" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   police station as we find out who actually stole the $300,000, but 
   the final shots (at Nellie's place) reveal a whole other unexpected 
   side of several characters, leading to death and a surprising bit of 
   final dialogue.&nbsp; Director Fernando Di Leo (<B><A HREF="#SlaughterHotel1971">SLAUGHTER
    HOTEL</A></B> - 1971; <B><A HREF="#KidnapSyndicate">KIDNAP SYNDICATE</A></B> 
   - 1975) keeps the viewer on the edge of their seats, thanks to 
   frequent nudity, bloody violence and because we really want to find 
   out who actually stole the $300,000. Everyone in this film believes 
   Ugo is responsible and the viewer doesn't know what to believe since 
   we have no prior background on Ugo, so we really have no idea what 
   type of man he really is and have to rely on tidbits of information 
   that the script (also by Di Leo) gives us as the film progresses. 
   While Gastone Moschin (<B><A HREF="action.htm#MagnumCop1978">MAGNUM COP</A></B> 
   - 1978) is pretty one-note and expressionless as Ugo (he spends most 
   of the film brooding and chain-smoking cigarettes), Mario Adorf is 
   the stand-out here as the sadistic Rocco. Doing a complete reversal 
   of his role as the good-hearted pimp Luca Canali in Di Leo's <B><A HREF="action.htm#Manhunt1972">M</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="action.htm#Manhunt1972">ANHUNT</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"> 
   (made the same year as this), Adorf is simply wonderful as a man 
   without a conscience, equally happy slapping women around as he is 
   killing everyone he perceives as his enemies. His actions at the end 
   of the film, including a particular line of dialogue, will surprise 
   even the staunchest crime thriller fan. There is actually an honor to 
   his code of conduct. There's some funny dubbing (although Lionel 
   Stander dubs his own voice) and the goofiest bit of dialogue comes 
   when Fonzino yells at Ugo for taking up with Nellie again. He says, 
   &quot;Playing gigilo to a belly dancer! Go on and get the hell out of 
   here and go play with her dangling dingleberries!&quot; Priceless. 
   The beautiful Barbara Bouchet (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CryOfAProstitute">CRY
    OF A PROSTITUTE</A></B> - 1974) is wasted here in a small role, 
   although her character plays an important part in the finale. 
   Speaking of the finale, it is one of the most fatalistic in recent 
   memory, but it seems to fit like a hand in a glove. This is not a 
   typical Italian crime thriller. There are no good guys or bad guys.

    Belmont (Eli Rich) is a soft spoken sunday school teacher who likes 
   to pick up prostitutes. Steve is also a serial killer who strangles 
   his pick-ups and buries them in a mass grave in the desert. The press 
   label him the &quot;Mojave Murderer&quot; after nine bodies are found

    Steve is unjustly accused of fondling a girl in his class. The girl 
   dislikes Steve immensely and tries to get him dismissed. No one at 
   the church believes the charges because he is such a &quot;sensitive 
   and caring&quot; person. The girl's father apologizes to Steve. He 
   gets fired from his weekday job as a gate security guard for 
   assaulting a female employee. He picks up a schoolgirl and kills her 
   while she gives him a handjob (perhaps in retribution for the 
   trumped-up charge at church). He is appointed head of the Adolescent 
   Crisis Center by his church. As you can see, Steve has a severe case 
   of Jekyll and Hyde syndrome. By day he is a mild mannered, 
   smooth-talking, church going man who helps kids and by night he is a 
   pathological, quick-thinking psycho killer who strangles women and 
   then pisses on their shared grave. His inadequacies as a man (he's

    This film, shot under the title <B><A HREF="murder_mansion_1972_foreign_ads.htm">QUANDO
    MARTA URLO DALLA TOMBA</A></B> (&quot;When Marta Screams From The 
   Tomb&quot;), is very atmospheric, as fog fills every frame. 
   Unfortunately, the story (screenplay by Luis G. de Blain [Umberto 
   Lenzi's <B><A HREF="#KnifeOfIce1972">KNIFE OF ICE</A></B> - 1972] 
   &amp; Antonio Troiso [<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BeyondTheDoor1974">BEYOND
    THE DOOR</A></B> - 1974]) makes very little sense, throwing all 
   types of supernatural events into the film, as well as secret 
   passageways in the hotel, none of it amounting to anything. Director 
   Francisco Lara Polop (Producer of <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CountDraculasLove">COUNT
    DRACULA'S GREAT LOVE</A></B> - 1972 and Director of <B><A HREF="monk_1990.htm">THE
    MONK</A></B> - 1990) tries to keep our minds off the plot by 
   tossing-in many jump scares, some of them quite good (Such as Martha 
   not lifting a finger to help Mr. Porter when he is killed by the 
   Chauffeur. Quite the opposite, she laughs! Fred and Laura discover 
   his body pinned to a gravestone in the creepy cemetery), but when the 
   film was over, I wanted to write a review of the plot, but damned if 
   I could figure it out! There is a massacre at the hotel in the end, 
   where the real culprit guns-down the remainder of the cast, but I 
   sure as hell couldn't figure out why. It has something to do with a 
   will (this whole film plays out like a &quot;reading of the will&quot;
    murder mystery, much like <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BayOfBlood1971">A
    BAY OF BLOOD</A></B> [1971], but without the bloody gore or nudity). 
   It could be because this film was butchered by Europix when they 
   released it as part of their &quot;Orgy Of The Dead&quot; triple 
   feature in order to get a PG Rating. According to the book &quot;<A HREF="blood_and_black_lace_book.htm">Blood
    &amp; Black Lace</A>&quot; (an essential part of my library), this 
   film was originally 105 minutes long and was shorn of over 20 minutes 
   to get the PG rating, cutting out not just the nudity and some of the 
   extreme violence, but also exposition needed to have this film make 
   any sense. It is this edit that fell into the Public Domain and is 
   easily available on many DVD compilations, like the <B><A HREF="drive_in_movie_classics_dvd_compilation.htm">DRIVE
    IN MOVIE CLASSICS</A></B> 50-film compilation from Mill Creek 
   Entertainment (which is how I viewed it). This version was also 
   released on VHS from both <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Unicorn">Unicorn

   probably poop in your Depends because you are too lazy to get off the

   Hieronimus A. Steinback: <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;For centuries 
   philosophers and poets have searched the universe for evidence of the 
   existence of the Devil. However, it would have sufficed to look for 
   it at the bottom of their souls.&quot;</FONT></B> (Truer words have 
   never been spoken, especially for this film.). We then see a woman 
   being stripped topless in her apartment by an intruder dressed in 
   black leather. He then throws her down on her bed, strips her naked 
   and begins raping her, while choking her with his hands. It is then 
   revealed that this was all a scene for a film that is being made, and 
   the actor playing the intruder, Michael Stanford (Stefano Patrizi; <B><A HREF="action.htm#RomeArmedTeeth">ROME:
    ARMED TO THE TEETH</A></B> - 1976), was getting a little too 
   involved in his role and has to be pulled off actress Beryl (Laura 
   Gemser; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BlackCobra1976">BLACK COBRA</A></B> 
   - 1976; and too many <B><A HREF="emanuelle_films_1973-1983.htm">EMMANUELLE</A></B> 
   films to mention) by the film crew. Michael takes a big <A HREF="j&amp;b_scotch_whiskey_in_italian_films.htm">swig
    of J&amp;B Scotch</A> (a staple in Italian films) while the film's 
   director, Hans Schwartz (Henri Garcin; <B><A HREF="someone_behind_the_door_1971.htm">SOMEONE
    BEHIND THE DOOR</A></B> - 1971), congratulates him on a &quot;very 
   effective scene&quot; and goes on to say &quot;It looked like you 
   really wanted to murder her!&quot; (anything for a shot!). While at 
   his home, Michael relaxes by playing guitar and singing a sappy love 
   song (that doesn't match his lip movements), when a gust of wind 
   blows open a window. This somehow give him the idea of looking at 
   some old childhood photos, which triggers a flashback where a young 
   Michael runs into his loving mother's arms in a beautiful backyard. 
   For some reason, Michael hasn't talked to his mother in over 15 
   years, so he calls her and says that he and his girlfriend Deborah 
   Jordan (Silvia Dionisio; <B><A HREF="#TerrorExpress1979">TERROR EXPRESS</A></B> 
   - 1979) are coming to spend a few days with her at her country estate 
   and he has invited three more friends to join them later. Michael has 
   always had frequent flashbacks about him and his mother Glenda (Anita 
   Strindberg; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WhoSawHerDie">WHO SAW HER DIE?</A></B> 
   - 1972) and how, as a young boy, he stabbed his father (a famous 
   orchestra conductor) to death when he saw him beating up his mother 
   (he was found holding the bloody knife). Michael was committed to an 
   institution as a child and has partial amnesia about the event, only 
   remembering bits and pieces about it. When Michael and Deborah arrive 
   at his mother's country estate, Glenda's longtime personal assistant 
   (i.e. butler) Oliver (John Richardson; <B><A HREF="#Eyeball1975">EYEBALL</A></B> 
   - 1975) stares at Michael and says his resemblance to the 
   &quot;Maestro&quot; is uncanny. Michael swears he heard some music 
   coming from the house when he pulled up, but Oliver says that no 
   music has played in that house since the Maestro died. Oliver also 
   tells Michael that his mother is very sick and not to tell her he 
   told him (one of the first things Michael does when he meets his 
   her!) and that the electricity is out because the wiring in the house 
   is old and even a gust of wind knocks it out. Oliver gives Michael 
   his father's old bedroom to sleep in, while he escorts Deborah to her 
   bedroom, which is clear across the huge mansion. Deborah is 
   pissed-off at Michael for introducing her to his mother as his 
   secretary (there's a good reason for that) and it is apparent as soon 
   as his mother locks eyes on Michael after such a long period of time, 
   that she has incestual feelings for him (It could be because he looks 
   like his father or his mother is just into incest). It could also be 
   that Michael feels the same (It would be one reason whey he 
   introduced Deborah as his secretary). Glenda also shows Michael a 
   portrait of her father and how much he looks like him (In his head, 
   Michael hears his father say, &quot;Michael, why did you do this to 
   me?&quot;). Is it no wonder Michael hasn't visited his mother for so 
   many years? To prove his non-incestual masculinity, a totally nude 
   Michael and Deborah make love on the couch. The next day, Michael's 
   three other friends show up at the house: Director and avid 
   photographer Hans (When Hans tries to take a photo of Oliver, he 
   shields his face with his arms); Actress Beryl (who has still 
   remained friends with Michael even after almost killing her on the 
   movie set); and Assistant Director Shirley (Martine Brochard; <B><A HREF="action.htm#ViolentProfession73">THE
    VIOLENT PROFESSIONALS</A></B> - 1973), who has brought her tiny pet 
   dog with her. When Hans asks Oliver why he didn't want his picture 
   taken, Beryl interjects and says, &quot;They say when you photograph 
   someone, you take away a small part of his soul. It can make him very 
   ill...or even kill him.&quot; Beryl says her birthplace on the Island 
   of Martinique believes in such customs (Which begs the question: Why 
   did Beryl become a film actress?). A short time later, they all get 
   into a discussion about the occult, where Glenda says that even if it 
   is not real, if you believe in it strong enough, it can still kill 
   you (This is one of the many scenes that is not in the English 
   language version, yet it really is important to the story). When 
   everyone goes to sleep Glenda and Hans have a private conversation on 
   how Michael was sent to a mental institution after he killed his 
   father and was surprised how such a &quot;gentle soul&quot; could 
   commit such a heinous crime (Hans' mind goes back to when Michael was 
   choking Beryl on the movie set just a few days ago). She begs Hans 
   not to tell Michael what she just told him and he agrees (Believe me, 
   all this long-windedness really is an important part of the plot). 
   They also talk about reincarnation, which reveals a lot about Glenda 
   and Hans' personalities. In a strange scene, we see and invisible 
   person leaving wet footprints on the ground as it walks into 
   Shirley's bedroom and she screams. Beryl sees a shadow holding a 
   crossbow and Shirley denies to Beryl that she ever screamed. Beryl 
   decides to take a bath and then the lights go out, someone wearing 
   black gloves trying to drown her in the tub. Shirley's dog saves the 
   day, barking at the intruder and chasing him away, saving Beryl from 
   a certain death. Michael begins acting like his father and when 
   Deborah notices a strange ritualistic icon in a painting, she has a 
   strange dream (?) where a zombie-faced monk makes her go to the 
   basement of the mansion (her breasts are always popping-out of her 
   nightgown), but she finds a door that leads to outside which she 
   thinks will be safe, but she runs directly into a giant spider web, 
   complete with a big-assed black spider hanging from the web. She 
   escapes, only to find herself attacked by bats in a windy tunnel. 
   Next, she finds herself in the thick brush of the woods, where she 
   loses the top half of her nightgown and scratches her upper torso and 
   breasts while a bunch of human skulls above her bleed from their 
   mouths and eyes sockets all over her. Finally, she is tied to the 
   wall of the basement while a giant crucifix on the wall opposite her 
   is burning. Classical music plays (Franz Liszt's &quot;<I>From the 
   Cradle to the Grave</I>&quot;) and a nun rips off all of Deborah's 
   clothes, while snakes slither at her feet and a deformed nun makes 
   her drink the blood of a chicken she just decapitated. Then the large 
   spider approaches her and grabs her legs, only to discover that the 
   huge spider has black hands for legs. And you thought Michael was 
   having problems? (Be aware that most of this sequence also doesn't 
   appear in the English language version of the film, but, it too, 
   plays an important part of the plot). Michael take all his friends to 
   his childhood &quot;private kingdom&quot;: a beautiful river with a 
   really nice waterfall, where everyone discuss with each other all the 
   strange things they dreamed or happened the night before. It's not 
   long before most of these people will never make it out of the estate 
   alive. Michael tells everyone he was in a trance last night, 
   something his overpriced psychiatrist calls &quot;disassociation&quot;
    and <A HREF="murder_obsession_1981b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/fear 1981 aka murder obsession vhs front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="191" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>&quot;psychosomatic&quot;.
    Hans mentions he saw Oliver walking around in a trance last night 
   and Michael says that ever since he was a child, he saw Oliver 
   sleepwalking all the time, and admits to everyone that he did kill 
   his father for beating up his mother. Michael cheats on Deborah and 
   makes love to Beryl on the banks of the river, but when he wakes up, 
   he discovers Beryl dead, her torso cut from her breasts down to her 
   vagina and Michael is holding the bloody knife (just like when he 
   killed his father). Hans, who we learn saw the whole thing happen, 
   writes a note saying that he is going to the police, but as he is 
   walking through his bedroom door, someone splits his skull in two 
   with an axe and splatters his brains all over the place. The bloody 
   black-gloved killer then destroys the note and drives Hans' car off 
   to make it look as if Hans is leaving by himself. As Shirley sees 
   Hans' car drive away, she notices that he has left his precious 
   camera behind, something that Hans would never do if he were leaving. 
   She begins to develop the negatives and notices something interesting 
   on one of them, but before she can tell anyone, she has her head 
   nearly cut off with a chainsaw (the same chainsaw we saw Oliver using 
   to make logs for the fireplace), while Deborah notices black leather 
   gloves in Glenda's bedroom. When Oliver serves dinner, only Glenda 
   and Deborah attend and Deborah notices that Glenda is wearing the 
   same ritualistic icon around her neck that triggered her nightmare 
   earlier. Or was it a nightmare at all? I'll never tell. I'll leave it 
   up to you to discover who the killer is (the clues are in this review 
   and, no. it's not Shirley's dog!). Like most giallo films, nearly 
   everyone is hiding a secret from their past that they are trying to 
   keep hidden. I will tell you this because you probably already 
   guessed it: Michael did not kill his father. He was an easy patsy to 
   blame since he was so young. It looks like years of psychotherapy 
   have done him more harm than good. A tape recording left behind 
   explains it all, but there's an unexpected supernatural angle at the 
   finale tied to Deborah's dreams which make the killings all the more 
   sinister. That's all I'll say, except if you are expecting a happy 
   ending, you will be bitterly disappointed.&nbsp; Director Riccardo 
   Freda (who passed away in 1999 at the age of 90) keeps you guessing 
   from beginning to end. When you think you have it all figured out, 
   the screenplay, by Freda, Antonio Cesare Corti (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#City Walking Dead">CITY
    OF THE WAKLING DEAD</A></B> - 1980) and Fabio Piccione (<B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Queen Kong">QUEEN
    KONG</A></B> - 1976), gives you another piece of information which 
   tosses your ideas into the garbage. While there are extreme bits of 
   gore (some of the effects are done by Italian effects master Sergio 
   Stivaletti, this being his first film), the film doesn't dwell on 
   them. It's basically hit and run, which is best displayed in Hans' 
   death by axe, It's just a quick hit, some brain matter flying in the 
   air and on to the next scene. If it plays for more than two seconds, 
   you are lucky. Too bad we can't say the same thing about the giant 
   spider. It is shown way too long and looks as realistic as a 
   Sharknado. The film (made under the title <B><A HREF="murder_obsession_1981c_italy_images.htm">FOLLIA
    OMICIDA</A></B>), also known in the U.S. as <A HREF="murder_obsession_1981b.htm#Unconscious"><B>UNCONSCIOUS</B></A>,

    An old man is found dead as he exits the Tunnel of Horror ride in 
   Luna Park. His name was Johannes Wallenberger, a millionaire who made 
   his fortune in South America, and he purchased a million dollar life 
   insurance policy just a couple of hours before his death. He also 
   reportedly had a bag of cash on him which was not found on or near 
   his body. Since the policy on his life was so large, insurance 
   investigator Chris Buyer (Robert Hoffmann; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Spasmo">SPASMO</A></B>

   a newspaper reporter and they quickly fall in love (Earlier in the

   into her apartment, but when she tries to call the police, the phone 
   is dead. A person wearing a black hood and black gloves (a giallo 
   staple) enters her bedroom window, holding a piece of rope as if he 
   is going to strangle her. Catherine screams and passes out, waking up

   come for a visit. Catherine tells Chris that her mother hasn't been 
   the same since her father was killed and, at dinner, Barbara accuses 
   Catherine of murdering their father, causing Magda to slap Barbara 
   and Catherine passing out (again). Magda begins to act crazy, talking 
   to her dead husband, saying Catherine couldn't have possibly killed 
   him. Is Mom going bonkers or is this all an act?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    That night, Chris does some investigating on his own, spying Gunther 
   making love to Sybil in the barn (more nudity!). The following 
   morning the Wallenberg household is paid a visit by police Inspector 
   Huber (Adolfo Celi; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Manhunt1972">MANHUNT</A></B> 
   - 1972), who theorizes that Johannes was being blackmailed, which was 
   why he was carrying a bag of money on him the night he was murdered. 
   The Inspector not-so-politely points the finger at Magda, who exits 
   the room in a huff. The house is then visited by Catherine's doctor, 
   who tells Chris he should &quot;forget about&quot; Catherine because 
   any &quot;emotional upheaval&quot; could be detrimental to her 
   &quot;serious condition&quot;. When Chris asks what is wrong with 
   her, the doctor says it is something Catherine has had since she was 
   a child, but he will not elaborate (We do know it causes her to pass out).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Chris then pays less attention to Catherine, falling for the charms 
   of Barbara, making love to her, but when her dead, naked body is 
   found sprawled on the family property by Catherine, Inspector Huber 
   begins to look at Chris as a suspect. Luckily, Barbara is holding a 
   button in her clenched rigored fist, a button which Chris identifies 
   as coming from Gunther's jacket. At the same time, Catherine notices 
   the same strange man spying on her from a car, so she and Chris take 
   off in his car to try and follow him, but are unsuccessful. When they 
   get home, they find Magda <A HREF="naked_girl_killed_in_the_park_1972_italy_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/naked girl killed in the park italy poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>dancing
    wildly while she holds a conversation with the imaginary Johannes. 
   The electricity goes out in the house and someone murders Sybil, 
   cutting her throat. Gunther tries to kill Chris, but Chris knocks him 
   out. The Inspector charges Gunther with Sybil's murder&nbsp; but he 
   still thinks Magda, Catherine or even Barbara (or all three) were 
   responsible for Johannes' murder, killing him for his life insurance 
   policy and then turning on each other (Magda tells Chris that 
   Catherine is destined to die the same way her father did). Just who 
   is the killer of Johannes and Barbara? Is the Inspector correct or is 
   the man following Catherine responsible? All will be answered in the 
   film's finale. I have given you the clues, now deduce!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While not as smart or involving as most of the good giallo films, 
   director Alfonso Brescia does populate it with a bunch of seasoned 
   pros, all who have appeared in many other films in this genre. The 
   screenplay, by Peter Skerl (director/writer of the bad taste 
   beastiality film <B><A HREF="dog_lay_afternoon_1976.htm">DOG LAY AFTERNOON</A></B> 
   - 1976) &amp; G. A. Martucci (director/writer of <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#RedMonks1988">THE
    RED MONKS</A></B> - 1988), based on a story by Antonio Fos 
   (screenwriter of <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#VampiresNightOrgy72">THE
    VAMPIRES NIGHT ORGY</A></B> and <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Apartment13thFl72">CANNIBAL
    MAN</A></B> [both 1972]), is light on blood and violence, but the 
   unexpected death of a major character and the reveal of the killer in 
   the finale does come as a surprise. It also explains why Johannes 
   bought a life insurance policy, why he was killed (What significance 
   did South America have in films and books during the '70s?) and 
   exactly who the woman was in the restaurant and other places during 
   the run of the film (She meets a fitting demise in Luna Park courtesy 
   of a moving rollercoaster as she is trying to escape from the 
   police). This is much more enjoyable than Brescia's other films. I

   killings. Thinking that Carla is dead, they leave the house and go to 
   a bar and get drunk. Of course Carla is not dead, just in a catatonic 
   state and she is brought to the hospital. The local sheriff (Bill 
   McLaughlin, who walks around with an expression on his face like he 
   was sucking on a lemon all day), doesn't quite believe the story and 
   wants to question Carla on what really happened. Her doctor refuses

   doing the killings and decides to form a posse (the whole town seems 
   to be full of torch-weilding hicks) and trap Carla in a house and 
   burn it down. Thinking Carla died in the fire (she didn't), Fletch 
   goes about his business in his butcher shop only to be surprised by 
   Carla, who cuts off his fingers with a meat slicer, plants a meat 
   cleaver in his back and then blows his head off with a shotgun. The 
   sheriff declares that Carla is dead and the killings are over. The 
   next time we see Carla is back in New York City, getting even with

   slacks off its premise, which is highly unusual for a Cirio H.

   It was released in both R-rated and Unrated editions, the Unrated

   violence. Guess which version you should track down? (NOTE: It seems 
   that 35mm elements of the Unrated Version seem to be lost since the 
   only place on the entire planet where the Unrated Version was 
   available was the United States. Every other country got the R-Rated

    Lord Alan Cunningham (Anthony Steffen; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CrimesBlackCat">CRIMES
    OF THE BLACK CAT</A></B> - 1972) escapes from an insane asylum (by 
   tying his sheets together) run by Dr. Richard Timberlane (Giacomo 
   Rossi Stuart; <B><A HREF="#WeekendMurders1970">WEEKEND MURDERS</A></B> 
   - 1970), but when he tries to climb over the asylum's front gate, he 
   is captured by the interns. We then experience a long flashback which 
   explains why Alan was committed to the asylum. Alan is in a car with 
   hooker Polly (M. Teresa Toffano) and pays her &#163;500 for sex and 
   they go to Alan's family castle. He tells Polly that he usually 
   doesn't come to the castle because it is full of bad memories. When 
   Polly asks Alan about the painting of his dead wife Evelyn, he takes 
   her to his medieval torture room (it is quite the sight), begins 
   whipping her&nbsp; and then ties her up. He thinks Polly is his dead 
   wife and he begs her to forgive him (he then has a 
   flashback-within-a-flashback where he and his red-haired dead wife 
   are prancing naked outside in the castle yard). He snaps back to 
   reality, killing Polly and burning her clothes, Evelyn's brother, 
   Albert (Roberto Maldera; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightOfThe Devils72">NIGHT
    OF THE DEVILS</A></B> - 1972), who is on Alan's payroll (he is the 
   caretaker of Alan's wild foxes), watches all this happen. Alan is 
   then visited by Richard, who is worried Alan is having 
   &quot;attacks&quot; again because he is thinking too much about 
   Evelyn. Alan tells Richard that everything is fine; he is going to a 
   seance tomorrow to try and contact Evelyn. Richard leaves, telling 
   Alan that he thinks it is not a good idea.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We are then with Alan at the seance, joined by good friend Farley 
   (Umberto Raho; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EerieMidnight1974">THE

    OF THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1971), as they try to contact the spirit of 
   Evelyn. Just as Evelyn is about to enter Miranda's body, Albert comes 
   into the room, shotgun in hand. He tells Alan that since Evelyn was 
   his sister, he has the right to be here and sits next to Alan. The 
   seance then continues and the ghost of Evelyn hoovers above the 
   seance table, calling Alan's name. Alan faints and then Richard 
   appears, worried about Alan's mental state. Miranda tells the doctor 
   if Alan didn't faint, he would have been able to talk to his dead 
   wife. Alan decides to leave the country family castle and live in the 
   city for good, but how long will that last? Not very long. Alan tells 
   George not to worry, he will not marry again and soon the Cunningham 
   estate will be all his. George says he is not worried about that, 
   he's more worried about Alan's mental state. Is he really?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see what we think is a funeral, as we see people carrying a 
   coffin and placing it on a table. It turns out to be stripper Susan's 
   (Erika Blanc; <B><A HREF="#DragonflyEachCorpse">A DRAGONFLY FOR EACH CORPSE</A></B> 
   - 1973) nightclub routine, as we watch her rise out of the coffin and 
   remove her clothes. Alan is in the audience and is very interested in 
   Susan (Uh, oh!). Alan buys Susan a drink (He pulls on her natural red 
   hair thinking it is a wig. Alan has an aversion to women with red 
   hair, as we find out later in the film.) and asks her to spend a 
   weekend with him. Yes, they are back at the castle and the murderous 
   rage takes over Alan. Susan does a striptease in front of Alan, so he 
   takes her to his torture chamber, whips her and then chokes her until 
   she passes out. He prepares a hypodermic needle, but Susan wakes up 
   and tries to escape the castle...topless. She hides in the castle's 
   creepy garden crypt, where Alan's ancestors are buried, but Alan 
   injects her with something and then passes out. When he wakes up, 
   Susan's body is gone. Albert, who was once again watching Alan the 
   night before, makes a remark to Alan about how his wild foxes were 
   not hungry this morning. Did Albert feed Susan's body to the foxes or 
   did Alan?&nbsp; Alan pays Albert &#163;100 and he walks away.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Alan tells Farley to restore the castle to its former glory, money 
   is of no consequence, but he is adamant that Farley doesn't touch the 
   garden crypt. He even suggests to Farley to wall-up the crypt so 
   strangers cannot break in. He gives Farley one month to restore the 
   castle. Alan then finds Susan's heart-shaped cigarette lighter on his 
   coffee table. How did it get there?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At the party of the unveiling of the restored castle, Alan spots a 
   blonde-haired young woman that catches his eye (Double Uh, Oh!). Her 
   name is Gladys (Marina Malfatti; <B><A HREF="black_ribbon_for_deborah_1974.htm">A
    BLACK RIBBON FOR DEBORAH</A></B> - 1974) and that night he asks 
   Gladys to marry him (When she asks why, he says because he wants to 
   go to bed with her. She replies, &quot;If I married every man who 
   wanted to go to bed with me, I'd never leave the church!&quot;). He 
   drives her home and they make love. Once again, Alan asks her to 
   marry him and she says yes. Alan phones George and tells him that he 
   is getting married to a woman he met three hours earlier. George is 
   not surprised, since his cousin is quick to make snap decisions and 
   wishes Alan well. They get married and hold the reception at the 
   castle, where George is happy for them, but both Albert and Farley 
   seem upset. Albert tells Alan that he shouldn't have gotten married 
   and blames his sister's death on Alan, saying she died while trying 
   to give him an heir (Evelyn died during childbirth. So did the 
   baby.). Alan says he is happy and Albert shouldn't worry, he will 
   still get his monthly check (He says, &quot;I can buy your conscience 
   at any time!&quot;). Alan and Gladys seem truly happy, but Gladys 
   wonders why he keeps a portrait of Evelyn in their bedroom. Then some 
   weird shit happens in the castle, destroying the newlywed couple's 
   happiness. Gladys tells Alan that she saw a red-haired maid in the 
   kitchen, but Alan made sure he didn't hire a maid with red hair. As a 
   matter of fact, all the maids in the castle look exactly alike (they 
   all wear white wigs!),<A HREF="night_evelyn_came_out_of_the_grave_1971_italy_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/night evelyn came out of the grave italy poster6 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="217" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   so none of them will remind Alan of Evelyn. Alan then hears his dead 
   wife calling to him. Richard explains to Gladys how much Evelyn meant 
   to Alan and Albert warns her to get away before it is too late. 
   Someone wearing work gloves and carrying a deadly poisonous snake has 
   it bite Albert on the neck, paralyzing him, then dragging his body to 
   a freshly dug grave and burying him alive. Gladys has the cemetery 
   custodian open Evelyn's tomb, but it is empty, Evelyn's body missing. 
   Aunt Agatha discovers all the priceless silverware, which has been 
   part of the Cunningham family for over three centuries, has been 
   stolen. Someone then kills Aunt Agatha in her wheelchair as she is 
   following Gladys, who is searching the Cunningham family crypt. What 
   is she looking for? (and, no, it's not for Richie Cunningham's 
   brother! [an old joke]) When Alan discovers what she is doing, he 
   slaps the shit out of Gladys, but George stops him. At the same time, 
   someone dumps Aunt Agatha's dead body in the fox cage, the little 
   creatures turning her into a tasty meal.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This is actually a horror film with giallo genre overtones. If all 
   you have ever seen were the washed-out fullscreen P.D. prints 
   (including a VHS tape from <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#United-VCI">VCI

   It's like watching a different film, especially Alan's failed escape 
   from the asylum, which takes full advantage of the widescreen 
   process. Director/co-screenwriter Emilio P. Miraglia (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#RedQueenKills1972">THE
    RED QUEEN KILLS SEVEN TIMES</A></B> - 1972) uses the castle's 
   exteriors and interiors to his advantage, filling the entire screen 
   with vital information, giving the castle a presence all its own. 
   While the reveal of the killer(s) is hardly a revelation, the film is 
   beautiful to look at and the surprise finale is just that, a 
   surprise. Filled with full-frontal male and female nudity (edited out 
   of the R-rated theatrical print, as were the coffin striptease and 
   much of the torture dungeon footage) and bursts of gory violence 
   (especially the shots of the foxes feasting on Aunt Agatha's body).

    (Billy Joe yells to the judge, &quot;You dumb son of a bitch, you're 
   making me a martyr!&quot;). Billy Joe looks at Fanny as he is led 
   away and says, &quot;Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord!&quot; and 
   members of his flock surround her outside the courthouse, where Fanny 
   hears them say, &quot;Die! Die! Die!&quot;, but their lips don't 
   move. It's not long thereafter that Fanny starts being terrorized by 
   thugs on motorcycles, she starts hearing voices and almost loses her 
   life on several occasions (or does she?). Fanny agrees to babysit 
   Judge Coogan's (Stewart Bradley) four overage (and unhappy to to have 
   a babysitter) kids for a weekend for $50 (She says, &quot;That's a 
   lot of money!&quot;). When she arrives at the house, she begins to 
   get a series of phone calls from a heavy breather who says, 
   &quot;Vengeance is mine!&quot; The phone line eventually goes dead 
   and the kids spot a strange figure in the backyard, so Fanny goes 
   outside to chase him away, only to discover a dummy with a note 
   attached to it that says simply, &quot;Vengeance&quot;. Fanny has the 
   kids lock all the windows and doors and turns on all the lights. One 
   of the kids, Peter (Daniel Spelling), blames the intruders on Fanny 
   and the trial and wants her to leave before they all get killed. 
   Peter sends brother Jimmy (Gary Morgan) outside to get help, but 
   Fanny watches him get stabbed to death by The Atoner. The Atoner 
   breaks into the house and the kids disappear one-by-one (only 
   bloodstains are left) until Fanny is left alone to defend herself 
   from the hooded knife-weilding intruders. When Fanny fights one of 
   the intruders with a butcher knife, she falls down the stairs and 
   dies and the real intruders are revealed. Little do they know that 
   they have intruders of their own to deal with.&nbsp; This tight 
   little thriller is rather bloodless, but is suspenseful and 
   tension-filled. It's apparent that Fanny has some personal issues (we 
   are given clues throughout the film), but the full extent of her 
   problems are not revealed until the film's surprising double-whammy 
   conclusion. Director Lee Madden (<B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Manhandlers1973">THE

   electrical power plant. Both men must avoid Colonel Oong's soldiers

   basically the whole film, folks, except it takes an 
   excruciatingly-long 94 minutes for the film to finally end (not 104 
   minutes as it's erroneously reported on the back of the VHS box, 
   thank God!). Needless to say, a busted eardrum is less painful than 
   sitting through this entire film, because you'll need to pierce your 
   eyelids with toothpicks to stay awake.&nbsp; After a promising start 
   (including watching a guy being riddled with machinegun fire and the 
   firing squad scene), this thriller, filmed on the American island of 
   Guam, quickly degenerates into a series of &quot;hide and seek&quot; 
   sequences where Mark Lenard (better known for portraying Mr. Spock's 
   father, Sarek, on <B><A HREF="star_trek_1966.htm">STAR TREK</A></B>) 
   and John Russell (<B><A HREF="legacy_of_blood_1971.htm">BLOOD LEGACY</A></B>

   reach their objectives. This looks and plays like an extended episode 
   of TV's <B><A HREF="mission_impossible_tv_series.htm">MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE</A></B>,
    with scenes of bloody violence and some nudity added. Most of the 
   time it's just talk, talk, talk, as we listen to the villagers 
   complain about Oong's treatment of their people, everyone says the 
   words &quot;saboteur&quot; and &quot;sabotage&quot; a lot and, for 
   some reason, the Catholic Church takes a verbal and physical beating. 
   There's not much to recommend here, as there are long stretches where 
   nothing at all happens, followed by short bursts of violence. The 
   only scene that registers any pulse was when village girl Kalin 
   (Linda Avery) shows her tits to Cootes and they make love. During the 
   middle of the nookie session, Kalin pulls out a big-ass knife and 
   stabs Cootes in the back. He reciprocates by strangling her with his 
   bare hands. When Cootes tells Kalin's brother, Kon (Bobby Canavarro), 
   what he has done, Kon shoves his sister's corpse into a barrell and 
   no one talks of it again. There's also a scene of a little girl being 
   shot and killed by Darmody (she was asking for it, standing in the 
   way between Darmody and the island's new General), but it's filmed in 
   such a lackadaisical manner, it fails to register. If there's anyone 
   to blame for this boring mess of a film, it has to lay squarely on 
   the shoulders of Terry Bourke (<B><A HREF="night_of_fear_1972.htm">NIGHT

   another rarely-seen thriller whose politics and storyline could have 
   only come from the sleazy 70's. Three seemingly normal family men, 
   Ken (Peter Fonda), Greg (John Phillip Law) and Art (Richard Lynch), 
   divorce themselves from their families for one week a year and take a 
   vacation together, where they lead a life of complete debauchery. 
   They hunt, screw, kidnap, rape and kill (not necessarily in that 
   order), all without any human conscience. For that one week, they 
   live like laws don't exist for them and anything (and I mean 
   anything) goes. This year, their hunting trip will end differently 
   than their previous ones. After taking turns screwing a waitress in a 
   hotel room, the trio kidnap unfaithful married bank manager Martin 
   (Alberto de Mendoza) and his girlfriend Nancy (Cornelia Sharpe) by 
   pulling their car <A HREF="open_season_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/open season poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="168" HEIGHT="231" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>over
    and pretending to be State Troopers. They bring the duo to the 
   woods, but Martin breaks loose and tries to flee in a canoe. He is 
   recaptured (Art shoots the canoe full of holes) and the trio bring 
   him and Nancy to a secluded cabin (which they built themselves) on an 
   island only accessible by boat. Nancy is chained to the cabin, where 
   she is forced to cook and clean and, later, do much worse while 
   Martin is forced to watch (and later participate) in the trio's 
   week-long game of defeating of the wills. There's one problem in all 
   this mess: Nancy begins to enjoy all the attention (or is it just 
   survival instinct?), while Martin has to watch helplessly from the 
   sidelines as he then becomes cook and maid to the foursome. As the 
   week comes to a close, the trio send Nancy and Martin packing, 
   although it's plain to see that it's about to become a human hunt, 
   ala <B><A HREF="most_dangerous_game_1932.htm">THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME</A></B>.
    Given a 30 minute head start (&quot;Run, rabbit, run!&quot;), Martin 
   and Nancy split up and the hunt is on. Unfortunately, things don't 
   end up too well for them, even though a mystery shooter is in the 
   woods.&nbsp; Director Peter Collinson (<B><A HREF="fright_1971.htm">FRIGHT</A></B>

   - 1972) paints the three protagonists as souless animals who find 
   pleasure in other people's misery. It's quite apparent that the trio 
   have been getting away with this type of degradation since they were 
   in college, as the film opens with a mother and her raped daughter 
   sitting down in a district attorney's office wanting to press charges 
   against the young trio, only to be told by the D.A. that no one would 
   believe three boys of such high standing would be capable of doing 
   such a thing. To show just how devoid of humanity they really are, 
   they make Nancy watch as they shoot every small animal in sight in 
   what turns into an orgy of quick-cutting scenes of rabbits, hawks, 
   ducks and geese being blown away by rifle, shotgun and pistol. Truly 
   disturbing. Sad to say that the film falls apart during the final 30 
   minutes, where it turns into your standard &quot;hunters vs. prey vs. 
   hunter&quot; scenario and all logic is thrown out the window. Up 
   until then, it's pretty good as Fonda, Law and Lynch chew up the 
   scenery as men with no moral compass and a friendship, though 
   demented, that is solid and unflappable. Only during the 70's would a 
   friendship like this be viewed as entertainment, especially the 
   nihilistic ending where a mystery shooter (William Holden in an 
   extended cameo) shows up, not to save Martin and Nancy (he couldn't 
   give a shit about them), but to get revenge on the trio for one of 
   their past aggressions. Our politically correct culture today would 
   not allow an ending like this to occur. And that's our loss. Also 
   starring Helga Line, William Layton, Bianca Estrada and Didi Sherman.

    Kathryn settles in to her new home and is basically alone, except of 
   Teresa, whom Kathryn verbally abuses when it suits her. Enter Peter 
   Donovan (Lou Castel; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#KillerNun1978">THE 
   KILLER NUN</A></B> - 1978), a handsome young man whose car has 
   broiken down at the villa's front gate. Peter asks Teresa for some 
   tools to fix his car, but she tells him to go away. Kathryn then 
   tells Teresa to get the young man what he needs. When Peter tells 
   Kathryn he needs a part to get his car running, Kathryn gives him a 
   glass of <A HREF="j&amp;b_scotch_whiskey_in_italian_films.htm">J&amp;B

   tells her he doesn't have enough money for the part and a hotel room. 
   As you can guess, a romance develops, and pretty soon they are taking 
   a shower together (What would a giallo film be without a naked shower 
   scene?). Kathryn tries to keep her romance with Peter a secret from 
   Teresa, sneaking outside in the middle of the night and secretly 
   ushering Peter into her bedroom to do the horizontal mambo. Kathryn 
   has to travel to London to settle some disagreements with her dead 
   husband's family over his will, but she passes out in front of Brian

    The first sign of trouble happens when Kathryn returns to Italy. In 
   the middle of the night, Kathryn is sure someone other than Teresa is 
   in the house. When Kathryn calls for Teresa and gets no answer, she 
   grabs a pistol and finds her shower running, the hot water steaming 
   up the bathroom. Someone locks her in a room, so she uses the pistol 
   to shoot the lock open. Teresa then appears and tells Kathryn that 
   she is imagining things. Then the phone keeps ringing, but every time 
   Kathryn answers it, no one is on the other end. It is quite obvious 
   someone is trying to drive Kathryn mad, but who? Kathryn goes to 
   Peter's slovemly home and demands to know why he hasn't called her. 
   They then make love and are interrupted mid-coitus by Peter's

   he has incurred (he's also a bookie). Kathryn pays-up in cash and 
   invites Peter to spend a week with her, telling him there will be no 
   more secrets from Teresa. As soon as Peter settles in, he is visited 
   by Eva (Colette Descombes), whom Peter introduces to Kathryn as his 
   sister. The threesome become great friends, Peter and Eva teaching 
   Kathryn how to be &quot;young&quot;, but, as we all know, no party 
   lasts forever and it is obvious Peter and Eva are up to something 
   dastardly. Are they even brother and sister?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While all three are dancing at a disco to a live band, Eva tells 
   Kathryn that one of Peter's quirks is that he always says the exact 
   opposite of what he means (Love = Hate and vice versa). Eva gives 
   Kathryn pills to make her stay awake, telling her that &quot;young 
   people&quot; like to party into the early morning. She also tells 
   Kathryn that making love to Peter shouldn't be hidden, it should be 
   done out in the open for everyone to see. She keeps feeding Kathryn 
   pills&nbsp; until she doesn't know whether she is coming or going (it 
   looks like Kathryn has cut and dyed her hair to look exactly like 
   Eva, but it turns out to be a wig). Eva jokingly points a loaded 
   pistol at Kathryn and Peter gets furious, pushing Eva across the room 
   and telling Kathryn he loves playing jokes, but not when guns are 
   involved. Kathryn yells at Peter, telling him his brutality against 
   Eva is unacceptable, Peter shooting back with, &quot;And you keep 
   your voice down! All of Brooklyn comes out of you!&quot; (Ouch!). 
   Peter and Kathryn end up making love after Eva tells her Peter is 
   sorry for saying such a hurtful thing (Peter is unable to say it 
   himself). Kathryn tells Brian that having two young adults in her 
   home has given her a whole new perspective on life and youth. She 
   also tells Brian she has no intention of getting married again and 
   Brian says he is not asking her to marry him. Kathryn says, &quot;No, 
   but you were about to until I stopped you.&quot; She tells Brian that 
   he is her closest friend and Brian says he feels the same way. She 
   then pops two pills in front of Brian and when he asks what they are 
   for, she lies and says she has been having liver problems and the 
   pills are medication for it. When Kathryn tells Brian she's begging 
   off early tonight, she drives home and finds a note on the table that 
   reads, &quot;Welcome home, tramp!&quot; She laughs and goes looking 
   for Peter and Eva and finds them naked in her bed making love. 
   Kathryn is shocked, but Peter and Eva smile at her as if they are 
   doing nothing wrong. Kathryn runs away crying and takes a tumble down 
   the stairs, knocking her unconscious.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Kathryn wakes up on the couch with Peter holding her hand, Eva 
   making her a drink and Teresa asking what happened. Kathryn tells 
   Teresa that she tripped down the stairs and that is as far as the 
   conversation goes. A short time later, Peter tells Kathryn that Eva 
   is his half-sister, same mother, different fathers. Kathryn says it's 
   disgusting, they both have deceived her. Eva asks Kathryn if she is 
   jealous, but it is her who should be jealous, but jealousy doesn't 
   exist for Eva (she has more quirks than Peter!). When Kathryn asks 
   Eva why she has come here, Eva says, &quot;I wanted to see who was 
   stealing Peter fom me. And when I saw you, I realized he was right. 
   And you made me fall in love with you, too.&quot; Eva tells Kathryn 
   there are all kinds of love, kissing Kathryn passionately on the 
   cheek, Peter egging them on. They then have a menage-a-trois on the 
   bed (heavy on the lesbianism). The combination of alcohol and pills 
   leads to a trippy experience for Kathryn and she wakes up the 
   following morning with all three of them naked in the same bed.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Now is when things take a decidedly dark turn. Peter and Eva talk 
   Kathryn into firing Teresa, saying they don't need an old biddie 
   spying on them. With Teresa gone, Peter and Eva start taking over the 
   household, keeping Kathryn stoned or drunk and slapping her around 
   when she has bouts of normalcy. When Kathryn has had enough of their 
   abuse, she kicks them out of the house and tells them never to 
   return. A few days later, Eva comes to the house and hands Kathryn an 
   envelope. Inside it are naked photos of Kathryn and Eva together in 
   bed. Kathryn asks Eva how much money does she and Peter want and 
   Peter says to Eva, &quot;How much does she think she's worth?&quot; 
   Eva says to Kathryn, &quot;We don't want your money. We want 
   you!&quot; It turns out Peter and Eva want to run Kathryn's life down 
   to the smallest detail (By keeping her a prisoner in her own home, 
   slapping her in the face, whipping her with a belt and other forms of 
   physical and mental torture. They even feed her a live frog for 
   dinner!), but it is obvious a third person is actually running the 
   show and it is not too much of a surprise to realize who is 
   orchestrating all this, but rather than ruining the surprise and the 
   reason this person is doing it, I will leave that for you to

   would follow this up with many more, including <B><A HREF="so_sweet_so_perverse_1969.htm">SO

   the mystery element in this film could be considered weak, there are 
   many other reasons why it is a good bet for giallo fans. The number 
   one reason is the nudity. This is the film that gave Carroll Baker's 
   career a second wind, thanks to her plentiful nude scenes. This film 
   became fairly popular all over the world because of her nude scenes, 
   even getting a pictorial in Playboy, which led to increased 
   admissions at the boxoffice. Ms. Baker was a frequent star in Italian 
   genre films, thanks to this movie, giallo films in particular (<B><A HREF="#FourthVictim1971">THE
    FOURTH VICTIM</A></B> - 1971; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Devil7Faces1971">THE

    FLOWER WITH THE DEADLY STING</A></B> - 1973; and many others, 
   including many of Lenzi's titles previously mentioned). The violence 
   level is also rather subdued for a giallo film, but this isn't a film 
   about violence, it's about control. Control of a person's money, life 
   and happiness until they are nothing more than a slave. A slave with 
   no reason to live. The final five minutes are <A HREF="paranoia_1969.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/paranoia 1969 italy poster small2a.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="217" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>very
    fatalistic and very surprising (much more surprising than the reveal 
   of the third person), so much so, I let out an audible gasp during 
   one scene (pertaining to Kathryn's fate). Breaking someone down to 
   their basest element by the use of alcohol and drugs is nothing new 
   in films, but in 1969 this was considered quite shocking and Carroll 
   Baker does an excellent job portraying a person who wishes to be 
   young again, but relies on the wrong two people, who wish to do her 
   harm. Once you know that Peter says the exact opposite of what he 
   means, you can figure out what his and Eva's intentions are. The 
   film's mystery may be weak, but the film on the whole is very 
   entertaining, thanks to the frequent nudity and Ms. Baker's 
   on-the-nose acting talents. This is why Umberto Lenzi is one of my 
   favorite Italian genre directors. No matter how bad some of his films 
   are (such as <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#BlackDemons1991">BLACK DEMONS</A></B> 
   - 1991), he always manages to make them entertaining. This film is a 
   great way to watch Lenzi get his giallo vibe going for the very first 
   time. In other words, it's right up my alley and should be right up 
   yours, too, if you are a giallo fanatic.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   (2012) -</B> Here's a film that tells the regular viewing public what 
   law enforcement knew all along: Vigilantes are not born, they are 
   created. This film may take the transformation of a &quot;nobody&quot;
    into a &quot;person who kills people who need killing&quot; a little 
   too far, but there have been worse cases on real dockets in the court 
   system. Joe (Martin Compston) narrates the opening of the film about 
   how his friend &quot;Piggy&quot; (Paul Anderson), whom we first see 
   stomping a man in the face, became Joe's savior. Joe says that 
   &quot;Piggy was an avenger&quot;, but in order to get to know him, we 
   first have to get to know Joe. Joe is your typical English bloke that 
   no one would take a second look at. He gets a job in the mail room of 
   a big business, where he is constantly teased and verbally assaulted 
   by his mailroom co-workers. Every day of his miserable life, it was 
   &quot;Go to work. Get numb (smoke pot). Go to sleep.&quot;. And then 
   Joe's brother John (Neill Maskell) becomes involved in Joe's life and 
   everything turns around for him. He is actually having fun in his 
   life with John, playing video games, going to bars, meeting women and 
   generally enjoying himself. An innocuous fight between John and 
   another bloke in a bar at first seems like nothing, but then Joe's 
   life takes a 180&#176; turn, as he is robbed by a man with a knife 
   (this is London, so guns are mostly out of the equation) and John is 
   beaten up by the guy and his friends at the bar so badly while he is 
   walking home, that Joe watches him die in the hospital. Everything 
   good about Joe's life was taken away from him in one night. And then 
   one night Piggy comes into Joe's life. He tells Joe that he was 
   John's friend years ago (even having a photo to prove it and Joe says 
   that he has faint memories of him). I know what you are thinking: 
   Piggy is an imaginary person made up on Joe's mind like in <B><A HREF="fight_club_1999.htm">FIGHT
    CLUB</A></B> (1999), but you would be wrong. Piggy tells Joe that 
   something should be done about John's death and they become close 
   (You have to pay close<A HREF="piggy_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/piggy 2012 dvd front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="220" HEIGHT="320" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   attention to their relationship to get some important clues). Piggy 
   becomes Joe's proxy vigilante, killing all those involved in John's 
   death one-by-one, but before he kills them, he gets the name of the 
   next victim. Piggy says he loved John and would kill for him (which 
   he has proved), but is Joe's love for John just as strong? Piggy 
   beats the crap out of one guy, but Joe runs away when Piggy grinds 
   the guy's hand into the pavement with his foot. Piggy catches up with 
   Joe and tells him what &quot;acceptable injury&quot; is and only the 
   truly guilty should die. They come up with a plan to kidnap one of 
   John's killers and wear pig noses as disguises, so they can get the 
   full list of names of the killers. The film makes Piggy seem like an 
   extension of Joe's psyche, especially when John's fiancee Claire 
   (Louise Dylan) comes to Joe's apartment and Piggy hides from her in 
   another room, but it has nothing to do with Joe's psyche. It has more 
   to do with Piggy keeping his identity a secret. It's also apparent 
   that Claire is starting to have romantic feelings for Joe, but it is 
   too soon...for now. Joe and Piggy put their kidnap plan into effect 
   (complete with pig noses, which will not elicit laughter in you, 
   believe me), kidnap one of the men and bring him to a filthy mens 
   room. Piggy tortures the guy and gets five names from him. Did Piggy 
   just beat the crap out of this guy (like he told Joe) or kill him, as 
   Joe is waiting outside because he's still is not ready to see such 
   ultra-violence? Joe likes hanging out with Claire, but while they are 
   walking down the street one night, Joe discovers the leader of John's 
   killers, Anthony (John Herdman), walking with his girlfriend (Kate 
   Korbel). Piggy and Joe kidnap Anthony that night, put a white hood 
   over his head and Piggy draws a smiley face on it before he beats 
   Anthony's head in until there is no white to be seen on the hood. 
   Anthony screams out that Jamie (Ed Skrein) is actually the killer, 
   but Piggy stomps on his head with his foot until he is dead. This 
   time Joe stays and watches the whole bloody ordeal, but still ends up 
   vomiting at the end. Joe is now a different person, who doesn't take 
   any more shit from his fellow mailroom workers (they actually end up 
   being scared of him). Joe and Piggy once again put their fake noses 
   on and Joe watches as Piggy slits the throat of another bar member. 
   Joe moves Claire into a new flat, while he and Piggy kidnap Jamie 
   (who ends up shitting himself), who now says Danny (Tommy McDonnell) 
   is the brains behind John's death. They hold him captive in the same 
   dirty bathroom, when a drunk friend of Claire's walks into the 
   bathroom and knocks Joe on his ass. It's clear by now that Claire 
   wants a romantic relationship with Joe, but it's hard being the 
   boyfriend of someone whose brother's killers he is disposing of. 
   Piggy frantically tells Joe that their latest escapade has been 
   caught on cameras, so they will have to kill Danny tonight or it will 
   never happen. They end up killing Danny and then go quiet for a 
   while. Joe is afraid that every knock on the door or phone call will 
   be from the police and then Piggy shows up and says they can help 
   other people&nbsp; (&quot;We aren't done yet! We aren't fucking done 
   yet!&quot;). Joe screams out &quot;I don't even fucking know who you 
   are!&quot; Turns out that Joe is correct, because when he checks out 
   Piggy's flat when he is not there, he discovers that the photo he 
   showed of him and John was a mock-up and the drawers are full of 
   newspaper articles on vigilante killings dating back a couple of 
   decades. Piggy shows up and calls Joe a &quot;self-made victim&quot; 
   (which he is) who needed a push in the right direction to balance out 
   the world. It seems like Piggy has been doing this kind of thing for 
   20 years: Picking people he sees who have suffered an unjust tragedy 
   in their lives and the bad guys end up getting away with it. Piggy 
   turns them into vigilantes because the law is useless in cases like 
   that. Is Piggy really a bad person? I guess it all depends on whether 
   you think guilty people that get away with it need killing, but the 
   justice system gets in the way, causing a need for them to get 
   justice they deserve. Claire kisses Joe, but he tells her. 
   &quot;Please don't get involved with me.&quot; He tells Claire he is 
   leaving for good, visits John's grave and becomes the next 
   &quot;avenger to the innocent&quot;. Yes, vigilantes are not born. 
   They are created.&nbsp; Director/screenwriter Kieron Hawkes (his 
   first feature film) makes no apologies for the extreme violence on 
   view because all violence is extreme. This really can't be classified 
   as a thriller or a horror film, because it could actually be viewed 
   as a documentary of how a mild-mannered picked-on person says enough 
   is enough and, with some major help, turns his life around. I'm not 
   saying I agree with the tactics shown in this film, but I have seen 
   too many people plead their cases down to probation or get off on 
   technicalities without regard for their victims or their family and 
   loved ones. This is a film that shows one way it could be achieved, 
   but to me, murder is still murder, even if the guy being killed is a 
   murderer. It's a slippery slope and vigilantes are as old as people 
   have been on this Earth, but it hardly makes a dent in crime 
   statistics. Judges are usually very hard on vigilantes because they 
   do the job judges wish they could do, but are hamstrung by the law, 
   so they make the vigilantes the bad guys and give them stiff 
   sentences. Real life doesn't end like <B><A HREF="death_wish_1974.htm">DEATH
    WISH</A></B> (1974). Still, this film is pretty good and you'll need 
   a strong stomach for some of the violent scenes, but what is truly 
   scary is that there may be vigilantes out there teaching other people 
   how to be vigilantes. I believe that is what Kieron Hawkes was trying 
   to convey here. A mousy little man could become a cold-blooded killer 
   with just a little prying. That should scare everybody. Also starring

   Prism cassette I had rented for the past year and it looked 
   interesting. The anticipation outweighed the end result as, 
   unfortunately, this is a fairly routine suspenser with very little to 
   recommend in its' favor besides the acting talents of the cast. J.D. 
   (James Wilder) returns to his hometown after a four year absence to 
   reconcile with the girl (Alexandra Paul) he left standing at the 
   altar. She is now the town's deputy sheriff and even though she still 
   harbors deep feelings for J.D., she has a problem with his leaving 
   town again to take a job with an oil company. While driving to his 
   job, J.D. picks up a girl (Daphne Zuniga) whose car has broken down 
   and soon they are doing the hot and sweaty in a motel room. Little 
   does J.D. know that she is an escaped mental patient who kills people 
   and takes over their identity, burying her victims in the clothing of 
   her previous identity. Soon she is mimicking the movements and dress 
   style of J.D., even dying her hair to match his color. She knocks him 
   out (she doesn't kill him because he is &quot;different from 
   everybody else&quot;) and locks him in the trunk of a car. She robs a 
   bank in the guise of J.D. and kills the guard. The deputy sheriff 
   teams up with an FBI agent (Don Harvey), who is in charge of 
   capturing the serial killer, when she learns of J.D.'s involvment in 
   the case. J.D. escapes from the trunk and returns to his hometown to 
   explain his innocence to his jilted lawperson. He is followed by the 
   psychotic killer (donning the disguise of the victim she pulled over 
   to facilitate her bank robbery escape) and she targets the deputy 
   sheriff as her next conquest. Beside the fleeting shots of nudity 
   this more or less has the look of a TV movie. The subject matter 
   should have been dealt with more graphically instead of the rather 
   bloodless affair offered here. Stick with </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="henry_portrait_of_a_serial_killer.htm">HENRY:

   the body of a young woman is found on the beach, shot in the throat, 
   her face burned to a crisp and dressed in yellow pyjamas, elderly 
   Inspector Thompson (Ray Milland, in a winning role) steps out of 
   retirement to investigate the murder (the first time we see Thompson,

    thing, too, because the young inspector, Morris (Rod Mullinar), 
   handling the case doesn't know his asshole from his elbow. We are 
   then introduced to Professor Henry Douglas (Mel Ferrer) and Glenda 
   Blythe (Dalila Di Lazzaro), who discuss a missing friend named Evelyn 
   (Vanessa Vitale). After noticing that Professor Douglas keeps a 
   pistol in the glovebox of his car, Glenda relates a story to the 
   Professor about the last time she saw Evelyn (it involves yellow 
   pyjamas and a lesbian encounter). Is it possible that the murdered 
   girl on the beach is Evelyn? Not so fast. As Inspector Morris brings 
   in all the perverts in the area for questioning, Inspector Thompson 
   uses his years of experience and follows the clues, including 
   identifying the bullet used in the murder (it came from an American 
   military-issued weapon) and grains of rice found on the dead girl's 
   body. Inspector Morris still believes that the dead young woman was 
   murdered by sexual predators, since the autopsy shows she was raped 
   by multiple persons before she was killed, but he begins to notice 
   that Thompson's methods are getting results. Meanwhile, Glenda is 
   falling in love with Italian waiter Antonio (Michele Placido). The 
   only problem is, she forgot to tell her current boyfriend, Roy 
   (Howard Ross). The police have preserved the dead girl in a glass 
   enclosure and are displaying her body for the public to view (it's 
   quite a sight), in hopes someone can identify her. Thompson gets 
   closer to making her identification on his own, following clues to a 
   Chinese restaurant and a laundry on the docks. Glenda marries 
   Antonio, but still has sex with Roy on the side. Antonio grows 
   suspicious and Professor Douglas says nasty things to Glenda. How are 
   Glenda's story and Inspector Thompson's investigation tied together? 
   You'll have to watch the film for yourself. Needless to say, it's 
   surprising and unforgettable.&nbsp; Based on a true story, a 
   notorious 1934 murder in Australia that took police ten years to 
   solve (or was it?), this mystery film (it's not a giallo as many 
   people trumpet it, even though the victim was dressed in yellow) is a 
   fantastic piece of storytelling and must have been considered daring 
   for it's time. Not to give the surprise ending away, I will say this: 
   It's apparent that the creators of the TV series <B><A HREF="lost_tv_series_2004-2010.htm">LOST</A></B> 
   (2004 - 2010) owe a debt of gratitude to this film, as their story 
   structures are very similar. Director/scripter Flavio Mogherini (who 
   normally directed Italian comedies like <B><A HREF="lunatics_and_lovers_1976.htm">LUNATICS
    AND LOVERS</A></B> [1976]) has fashioned a film that seems to be 
   telling two unrelated stories, but it all comes togethe<A HREF="case_of_the_girl_in_the_yellow_pyjamas_1977.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/case of the girl in the yellow pyjamas aka pyjama girl case dutch vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="246" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>r
    in a satisfying brew of sex, infidelity and murder. This is one of 
   Ray Milland's (<B><A HREF="thing_with_two_heads_1972.htm">THE THING 
   WITH TWO HEADS</A></B> - 1972; <B><A HREF="#Survival Run">SURVIVAL RUN</A></B> 
   - 1978) best roles in the latter part of his career. Not only is he 
   believable in his role as a retired police inspector who hates 
   retirement, he throws himself into the character, coming across as 
   both gruff and gentle and upstaging everyone else who happens to be 
   in the frame with him. He runs-up against quite a few memorable 
   characters, too, including a dwarf dry cleaner, a bearded hippie who 
   like to masturbate, a disabled laundry worker with a busted steampipe 
   and an elderly gay gentleman who bathes in front of him. What's even 
   more shocking is that he's killed two-thirds of the way through the 
   film by the killer. He knows when he goes out that fateful night that 
   he may not come back alive, as he leaves a tape recorded message and 
   various clues throughout his apartment for Inspector Morris to find. 
   He's more than happy to go out that way because all Thompson wanted 
   was one last case to work on before he dies and Milland is wonderful 
   here displaying those emotions. The rest of <B><A HREF="pyjama_girl_case_1977b.htm">THE
    PYJAMA GIRL CASE</A></B> is equally enjoyable (and sometimes 
   maddening in it's obliqueness), as Morgherini gives the film a 
   colorful gloss (lots of gel lighting) and slowly unravels the mystery 
   with some genuine surprises along the way. While light in the 
   violence department (although there are some grisly sights on view), 
   there is plenty of nudity and a satisfaction that you are watching 
   something truly unusual. Once you hear the theme song, &quot;Your 
   Yellow Pyjama&quot;, sung by Amanda Lear (who sounds like Edith 
   Piaf), you will never forget it. The music score by Riz Otorlini, 
   which consists of harmonica, electronic and orchestral cues, also 
   enhances the proceedings. The droning synthesizers add an air of 
   urgency to some of the scenes, especially the finale, where Glenda 
   does something unthinkable (but well within her character) to get the 
   money she so desperately needs. The use of harmonica and 
   &quot;wah-wah&quot; guitar in the closing scene, combined with an 
   unusual visual palette (a massive seaside graveyard and a bus full of 
   female majorettes in costume), hits all the right emotional notes for 
   the viewer. It's an excellent mix of sight and sound. Also known as <B><A HREF="case_of_the_girl_in_the_yellow_pyjamas_1977.htm">THE

   (1998) -</B> Best-selling author Luke Sinclair (Chris Sarandon), 
   whose novels deal with serial killers and graphic depictions of 
   violence and sex, is going through a severe case of writer's block 
   (he hasn't written a sentence in over eighteen months), so he decides 
   to get away from it all and drives to the small Maine coastal town of 
   Keeler's Point to clear his head and get away from the religious 
   fanatics who protest his books and spray him with red paint. Luke, 
   who is a recovering alcoholic and is supposed to be taking 
   anti-depression meds (but isn't), takes a room in Keeler's Point's 
   only motel and begins hitting the bottle for inspiration, only he 
   begins to have visions of electroshock treatments and some mysterious 
   person chasing a woman in the woods. When two hunters find the raped 
   and murdered nude body of a young woman in the woods, Sheriff Norris 
   (Vlasta Vrana; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Scanners 2">SCANNERS II: 
   THE NEW ORDER</A></B> - 1990) is forced to call in the State Police 
   to investigate, since the small town never had a murder before. The 
   State Police sends Detective Sonya Lehrman (Catherine Mary Stewart; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Nightflyers">NIGHTFLYERS</A></B> 
   - 1987) to investigate and Sheriff Norris is not happy at all, since 
   he's already convinced that Luke is the murderer. It seems the<A HREF="reaper_1998.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/reaper 1998 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="186" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   killing is an exact re-enactment of one of the murders in Luke's most 
   recent novel, titled &quot;Reaper&quot;, and a page from the book 
   describing the murder is found next to the body. Sonya is not too 
   sure about Luke's guilt and, since she is staying in the same motel 
   he is, she can keep close tabs on him. As more murders and bodies 
   begin piling up, all of them taken directly from Luke's novel, Luke's 
   visions begin getting more bizarre and he begins babbling about 
   doppelgangers to Sonya, which makes him look all the more guilty in 
   the Sheriff's eyes. Sonya, on the other hand, thinks &quot;it's all 
   to simple&quot; and believes there is another explanation. Sonya's 
   investigation dredges up some interesting bits of information, such 
   as Luke's stay in a mental institution seven years earlier due to 
   &quot;alcohol abuse&quot; and that the Sheriff was once a vice cop in 
   Chicago who was forced to resign for planting evidence. So who is the 
   killer? Sonya better figure it out soon before she becomes a victim 
   herself. The sudden appearance of the TV news and Luke's mistrusting 
   wife, Melanie (Gillian Ferrabee), who thinks he is having an affair 
   with Sonya (he's not), only complicates matters. Sonya is forced to 
   shoot a suspect (she's never killed anyone before), which drives her 
   into the arms of an understanding Luke. It's not the best 
   professional move, as you will find out in the film's conclusion, 
   where the killer is unmasked and motives are revealed.&nbsp; This 
   Canadian-made thriller, directed by John Bradshaw (<B><A HREF="specimen_1996.htm">SPECIMEN</A></B> 
   - 1996; <B><A HREF="lethal_tender_1997.htm">LETHAL TENDER</A></B> - 
   1997) and written by Vincent Monton and Matt Dorff, is a decent 
   whodunit with equal measures of police procedural and mystery 
   elements that, unfortunately, collapses about sixty minutes in. At 
   first, Chris Sarandon (<B><A HREF="sentinel_1977.htm">THE SENTINEL</A></B> 
   - 1977; <B><A HREF="childs_play_1988.htm">CHILD'S PLAY</A></B> - 
   1988) comes across as a little too aloof and self-centered, but as 
   the film progresses, it becomes obvious that his character is highly 
   flawed, as more information is revealed about his background. The 
   citizens of Keeler's Point don't come across as the nicest people in 
   the world, either, especially Wilma (Joanna Noyes), the motel 
   proprietor who keeps her ear to the wall and reports all of Luke's 
   goings-on to the Sheriff. It's really disappointing when the film 
   falls apart two-thirds of the way through, with the appearance of a 
   previously unseen red herring made to look like the killer, but it's 
   obvious to those even with only a third grade education that he's 
   not. What happens after that throws the balance of the film way off 
   track, ruining the logic of what came before it. The violence and 
   nudity are fairly restrained for an R-rated production; just a couple 
   of quick shots of nude bodies with objects in frame hiding the 
   naughty bits and hardly any blood at all (just a couple of bloody 
   bullet squibs). The only reason I can explain the R-rating is the 
   foul language. Take away the swearing and this film could play on TV 
   uncut. That's the film's biggest flaw, because it could have used an 
   injection of full-fledged nudity and a bit of the ultra-violence to 
   make it stand out from basic cable TV dreck. There are the makings of 
   a good film here, but <B>REAPER</B> fails to succeed due to a lack of 
   exploitable elements fans of this genre demand. Oh, and a lazy final 
   third. Also starring Rob Pinnock, James Bradford, Isabelle Cyr, Doug 
   Sutherland, John Moore and Stephen Morgan. Available on budget DVD 
   from Platinum Disc Corporation. <B>Rated R</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

   (2008) -</B> Film is a very subjective medium and can affect people 
   in totally different ways. <B>RED</B> will either hit you like a 
   painful punch to the gut or leave you bewildered, as we follow Avery 
   Ludlow (the excellent Brian Cox; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#TrickRTreat">TRICK
    'R TREAT</A></B> - 2007) on his odyssey of retribution. Is he a 
   madman or would you do the same thing? Either answer is acceptable, 
   yet if you are a true animal lover (as I am; animals are capable of 
   unconditional love, something which most humans are incapable of 
   understanding); the type of person who puts the same importance on 
   their pets as they put on any family member, then this film will 
   resonate and play with your emotions. Even though this film had a 
   troubled production history (Director Lucky McKee [<B><A HREF="may_2002.htm">MAY</A></B> 
   - 2002; co-director of <B><A HREF="all_cheerleaders_die_2013.htm">ALL 
   CHEERLEADERS DIE</A></B> - 2013] was mysteriously fired after a few 
   weeks of shooting and was replaced by producer Trygve Allister 
   Diesen), it does not distract that this is a beautifully acted and 
   highly emotional piece of cinema. Avery Ludlow and his 14 year-old 
   dog Red do everything together. One day, while fishing in the creek, 
   Avery and Red are confronted by three teens; the cruel Danny (Noel 
   Fisher; <B><A HREF="final_destination_2_2003.htm">FINAL DESTINATION 2</A></B> 
   - 2003), Danny's yes-man Pete (Shiloh Fernandez; <B><A HREF="dead_girl_2008.htm">DEAD

   is carrying a shotgun, robs Avery and when he discovers that Avery

    dollars on his possession, shoots Red point-blank, killing him 
   (Danny callously says to Avery, &quot;He's red now!&quot;). Harold 
   can't believe what Danny has done, but Avery is in such a state of 
   shock, he doesn't even turn around to look at the teens' faces, so he 
   can't identify them. Instead, Avery puts Red's corpse into his pickup 
   truck and drives home, burying Red in the backyard. Avery sets out to 
   find where the teens live, so he goes to the local gun store (he can 
   identify the shotgun), to find out Danny's address. The sympathetic 
   gun store owner, also a dog owner, gives Avery Danny's address, so 
   Avery travels to Danny's house and confronts Danny and Harold's 
   extremely rich father, Mr. McCormack (Tom Sizemore; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BottomFeeder">BOTTOM
    FEEDER</A></B> - 2006), where Danny and a nervous Harold flatly deny 
   having anything to do with Red's death. Sensing that he is not going 
   to get any cooperation from Mr. McCormack, Avery goes to lawyer 
   friend Sam (Richard Riehle; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hatchet2007">HATCHET</A></B> 
   - 2007), who tells him that all that can be done legally to the teen 
   amounts to nothing more than a slap on the wrist, since Red was just 
   an animal. Avery, who is a widower and got Red as a present from his 
   dead wife for his 50th birthday, tries everything within his power 
   legally to get satisfaction, even talking to Pete's white trash 
   parents (played by Robert Englund [<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Heartstopper2006">HEARTSTOPPER</A></B> 
   - 2006] and Amanda Plummer [<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Satans Little Help">SATAN'S
    LITTLE HELPER</A></B> - 2004]) and appealing to their common sense 
   of decency (with no luck). Sam puts Avery in touch with local TV 
   reporter Carrie (Kim Dickens; HBO's <B><A HREF="deadwood.htm">DEADWOOD</A></B> 
   and <B><A HREF="treme_hbo_series.htm">TREME</A></B>), who does a 
   story on Red's death and Avery's life, which touches Avery deeply 
   when he watches it on TV, but someone throws a rock through Avery's 
   window with a threatening note attached while he and Carrie are 
   watching the report. Avery and Carrie become good (non-romantic) 
   friends, but Carrie is pulled-off the story by her editor. Avery (who 
   is a Vietnam War hero and has a mentally unstable son in prison who 
   killed Avery's wife and younger son by burning them to death with 
   kerosene) finally has had enough of trying to get satisfaction 
   legally and begins following the teens around, learning their habits 
   and making their lives miserable (Danny becomes so agitated, he comes 
   at Avery with a baseball bat, but gets it turned on him instead). 
   When Avery's general store burns down, he finally loses control and 
   turns Mr. McCormack's control over the town to his advantage. When 
   all is said and done, everyone suffers devastating losses, but it is 
   Avery who finds true redemption, not with violence (although there is 
   some), but with an act of kindness by Carrie.&nbsp; Masterfully acted 
   by Brian Cox (the scene where he describes to Kim Dickens what his 
   psychotic son did to his family is Oscar-worthy stuff, that is if the 
   Academy Awards cared about films like this), with a good 
   dialogue-heavy screenplay by Stephen Susco (<B><A HREF="grudge_2004.htm">THE
    GRUDGE</A></B> - 2004) that is based on a novel by Jack Ketchum (who 
   appears here as a bartender using his real name, &quot;Dallas 
   Mayr&quot;), <B><A HREF="red_2008c.htm">RED</A></B> is a slow-burn of 
   a tale that will either make you praise Avery's level-headedness 
   throughout most of the film or make you angry that he didn't lose 
   control earlier, while non-animal lovers will wonder what all the 
   fuss is about (and, unfortunately, I know a few people who fit that 
   description). When Avery exhumes Red's corpse, brings it to the 
   McCormack residence and lays it on their front doorstep, it sets off 
   a sequence of events which will soon not be forgotten, where a man's 
   love for his dog proves to be greater than a father's love for his 
   sons. To say any more would destroy first-time viewers' enjoyment, if 
   &quot;enjoyment&quot; is the right word. While this film doesn't 
   intentionally tug at the heartstrings the same way <B><A HREF="marley_and_me_2008.htm">MARLEY
    AND ME</A></B> (2008; and worth viewing) does, <B>RED</B> perfectly 
   portrays the emotional devastation some people feel when they lose a 
   beloved pet (it's just as gut-wrenching as losing a family member).

    and some really gory set-pieces. Transplanted New Orleans police 
   detective John Prudhomme (Christopher Lambert), who is battling 
   personal demons, is assigned to investigate the brutal murder of a 
   Chicago man whose right arm was removed at the shoulder while he was 
   still alive. When Prudhomme and his new partner, the bad joke-telling 
   Detective Andrew Hollinsworth (the always enjoyable Leland Orser [<B><A HREF="bone_collector_1999.htm">THE
    BONE COLLECTOR</A></B> - 1999], who also had a small role in <B>SE7EN</B>),
    investigate the scene, they find &quot;He's Coming&quot; written in 
   lamb's blood on the window of the victim's house. The killer has also 
   carved Roman numerals on the victim's back and leaves a clue that 
   leads Prudhomme and Hollinsworth to another victim, also missing an 
   arm (the left one this time), who also has a different set of Roman 
   numerals carved in his back. This leads to a domino effect, as the 
   killer leaves another clue, which leads the detectives to another 
   victim (missing his head), more Roman numerals, another clue and so 
   on. Prudhomme determines that the killer is rebuilding the body of 
   Christ, as the Roman numerals correspond to chapter and verses in the 
   Bible dealing with the Apostles. All the victims were 33 years-old 
   (the same age as Christ when he died) and Prudhomme theorizes that 
   the killer is using the missing body parts to build a body of Christ 
   in preparation for the Resurrection. Prudhomme himself is going 
   through a personal crisis of faith because, six months earlier, he 
   witnessed his young son <A HREF="resurrection_1999.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/resurrection 1999 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>getting
    run-over and killed by a car we he darted out onto the street while 
   on his bike. Normally a very devout man, Prudhomme gave up on 
   religion and hasn't been to church since his son's death. Prudhomme 
   and Hollinsworth get some needed help when an FBI profiler named 
   Agent Wingate (Robert Joy) appears on the scene and offers his 
   expertise. The Press have dubbed the serial killer the &quot;Numbers 
   Killer&quot; and pressure is put on Prudhomme and his partner to 
   solve the case, so they accept his help. Prudhomme also gets help 
   from his old parish priest, Father Rousell (genre director and 
   part-time actor David Cronenberg), whom he hasn't seen or talked to 
   since his son's death. Prudhomme and Hollinsworth just miss catching 
   the killer murdering his latest victim (by removing his left leg, a 
   scene which will leave some viewers gagging). Since the killer is 
   pissed-off for nearly getting caught, he disables Hollinsworth with a 
   stun gun, dresses him in the killer's clothes, tapes a gun to his 
   hand, tapes-up his mouth and sends him out directly into the path of 
   waiting police, who shoot Hollinsworth in the leg with a shotgun 
   blast. Hollinsworth's left leg is amputated at the hospital, which is 
   then promptly stolen by the killer! Prudhomme vows revenge and soon 
   finds out that not everyone is who they say they are. He also makes a 
   shocking discovery at the killer's home, a sight so ghastly that not 
   everyone who views it will keep their lunch down. Prudhomme realizes 
   that the killer's last victim will be a pregnant woman named Mary, 
   who is about to give birth to a son (it's all in the Bible, folks!), 
   so Prudhomme has all the hospitals staked-out until the right woman 
   is found. The finale finds Prudhomme facing-off with the killer on 
   the hospital's roof, a baby boy's life hanging in the balance. Will 
   the memory of his son's death get in the way of Prudhomme stopping 
   this maniac once and for all?&nbsp; This is probably director Russell 
   Mulcahy's (<B><A HREF="razorback_1984.htm">RAZORBACK</A></B> - 1984; <B><A HREF="ricochet_1991.htm">RICOCHET</A></B>

   (1986), which, oddly enough, also starred Christopher Lambert. 
   Mulcahy utilizes every camera trick in the book to tell the story, 
   using weird camera angles, distorted lenses and sped-up and 
   slowed-down camera cranking, most of it to good effect, although some 
   sequences would have been better served with a more straight-forward 
   approach. Mulcahy also desaturates most of the colors here, giving 
   the film a gritty, nearly black and white nourish feel. In nearly 
   every scene, the background is so smoky or dusty, you feel as if you 
   would choke to death if you took a deep breath. Another common theme 
   in Mulcahy's films is the use of water and, in this film, it's 
   raining in nearly every scene. The script, by Brad Mirman (who also 
   receives story credit along with star Lambert), does drag in spots 
   (the film is a little long at 108 minutes), but it generally manages 
   to shock the viewer on several occasions, such as the scene when 
   Prudhomme believes the killer has murdered his wife Sara (Barbara 
   Tyson), only to discover a short time later that the body is that of 
   his wife's visiting sister. There are numerous gory set pieces, many 
   more than usual in films of this type. Most of it deals with corpses 
   missing body parts, but there are also some gushing blood scenes, 
   especially the one where Prudhomme unsuccessfully tries to stem the 
   flow of blood from the poor sap's missing leg wound. <B><A HREF="resurrection_1999b.htm">RESURRECTION</A></B> 
   is a good thriller that will have you engrossed from beginning to the 
   unforgettable end, where we view the serial killer's rancid creation. 
   It's hard to believe that this film was released directly to HBO and 
   bypassed a theatrical release. It's one of Christopher Lambert's best 
   performances of his career and a big improvement over most DTV crap.

   1980), who will only give her name as &quot;Hitch&quot; (It's Jamie 
   Lee's tribute to Alfred Hitchcock, not because she's hitch-hiking.). 
   Everyone in this film is playing one type of game or another, some 
   innocent and some deadly, but we eventually find out her name is 
   really &quot;Pamela Rushworth&quot;, whose father is not only rich, 
   he is famous and she needs to get away from him. After some clever 
   back-and-forth between Pat and Hitch (one funny scene finds Pat 
   complaining that Boswell never barks and Hitch tells him that Boswell 
   is a dingo, not a dog and dingos don't bark), we find out that a Jack 
   The Ripper-type serial killer, called &quot;Smith or Jones&quot; (who 
   we eventually find out is played by Australian stuntman supreme Grant 
   Page (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#StuntRock">STUNT ROCK</A></B> - 
   1978), who is driving a van, is also traveling this stretch of 
   highway and once he catches sight of Hitch, the game is one. You see, 
   the serial killer likes to cut-up pretty young things and only buries 
   parts of their bodies. What he does with the rest of the pieces is 
   better left for you to find out during the finale. When the serial 
   killer captures Hitch (there's a white-knuckle scene at a bathroom at 
   a rest stop on the highway, occupied by the strangest group of people 
   this side of a David Lynch film), the chase is on as Pat tries to 
   save Hitch, while the police believe Pat is the serial killer. But 
   just who is chasing whom? Tight dialogue (some of it very funny, 
   especially between Pat and Boswell) and some really tense situations 
   distinguish this film from most slasher films of the early 80's. For 
   one, there's very little blood or violence, as director Richard 
   Franklin makes you use your imagination during the kill scenes. And 
   it works. There's also a funny/tense scene where Pat is chasing the 
   killer down the streets of a town and the chase becomes slower and 
   slower as the road becomes narrower, until both vehicles become stuck 
   between two buildings. What happens next answers nearly all the 
   film's unanswered questions, like does Boswell really bark and why 
   does Pat's pork trailer weigh more than it did when he left the 
   depot? Even though this film is Rated PG, it is definitely not for 
   kids, as it is rather adult in nature and there are a lot of 
   double-endentres that will have the kids asking, &quot;Daddy, what 
   does he mean by that?&quot; I love Australian horror and thriller 
   films (maybe it's the deserted locations, wide panoramas where we see 
   nothing ahead except desert and dust and the sense of helplessness 
   that goes along with it) and <B><A HREF="road_games_1981b.htm">ROAD GAMES</A></B>

    what this psychotic couple is up to (Clint super-glues a motel 
   clerk's mouth and nose shut and watches him suffocate!) and all three 
   become genuine friends. At one point Clint saves Josh from certain 
   doom, when Josh (who doesn't know he is wanted by the law as their 
   accomplice) is snatched by a truck driver who spots his photo in a 
   newspaper. Clint blows the trucker's guts out with a shotgun. Josh 
   begins to suspect something is horribly wrong when he witnesses Clint 
   and Marla murder Stupid the Clown (billed simply as 
   &quot;Himself&quot; in a scene-stealing performance), a foul-mouthed 
   performance artist they pick up on the road. When Josh refuses to 
   participate in the killing, Clint and Marla tie him up and promise 
   him a slow death. Marla dies (her head goes through a window) after 
   unsuccessfully trying to seduce a bound and gagged Josh. When Clint 
   spots Marla's body, he strings Josh up by the neck and shoots him in 
   the knee. Interrupted by an ill-timed police visit, Josh breaks free 
   and slits Clint's throat. The next time we see Josh, he is picking up 
   a female hitchhiker. I guess he really wasn't much different than 
   Clint and Marla after all. This gritty, low-budget drama packs an 
   emotional wallop that will stay with you for quite a while. Well 
   acted by a cast of relative unknowns, the dialogue is delivered in a 
   true-to-life fashion that doesn't seem phony. This is a welcome

    SALTON SEA</A><A NAME="Salton Sea"></A> (2002) - </B>I've read a lot 
   of bad press about Val Kilmer: &quot;He's difficult.&quot; &quot;I'll 
   never work with him again.&quot; &quot;This guy's got an ego the size 
   of Texas.&quot; Frankly, I don't give a shit. Watch him in this movie 
   and you'll see one of the best actors of our generation. Even though 
   this film had a limited theatrical release, nobody seemed interested 
   at the time except a few critics, some who saw it for what it really 
   was: A slam-bang thriller with a personal edge so sharp, that the 
   viewer could get cut just for getting caught up in it. Kilmer 
   portrays a man with a mission. At first he's Tom Van Allen, a 
   musician who sees his wife (Chandra West) murdered by a pair of 
   masked gunmen who rip-off a meth-amphetamine lab (run by 
   musician/actor Meat Loaf), that they stop by when they get lost on 
   the road. A single red hair<A HREF="salton_sea_2002.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/salton sea small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="231" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   recovered on her body makes Kilmer take on another identity, Danny 
   Parker, a tweaker who hangs out with the dregs of society in hopes of 
   finding the person who put a bullet in his wife's head. He teams up 
   with a pair of corrupt cops (Anthony LaPaglia of <B><A HREF="without_a_trace_tv_series_2002-2009.htm">WITHOUT
    A TRACE</A></B> [2002 - 2009] and Doug Hutchinson of <B><A HREF="x_files_tv_1993_2002.htm">THE
    X-FILES</A></B> [1993 - 2002]) and rats out some suppliers to them 
   after they force him to do their bidding or go to jail. Parker wants 
   to set up a big deal with Pooh-Bear (the always interesting Vincent 
   D'Onofrio of <B><A HREF="law_and_order_criminal_intent_tv_series_2001-2011.htm">LAW
    &amp; ORDER: CRIMINAL INTENT</A></B> [2001 - 2011]), a man who lost 
   his nose from sniffing so much &quot;gak&quot; that he had a plastic 
   nose attached to his face. Parker knows who the killer is and goes 
   about setting up the ultimate trap to get his revenge. It involves a 
   Chinese cowboy (B.D. Wong of <B><A HREF="oz_tv.htm">OZ</A></B> [1997 
   - 2003]), $250,000 dollars in cash and a case of mistaken identity. 
   There are so many double and triple crosses in this film that in the 
   hand of a lesser director, this could be very confusing. Luckily, 
   director D.J. Caruso (<B><A HREF="black_cat_run_1998.htm">BLACK CAT RUN</A></B>

   the last two starring Shia LaBeauf) has a firm grasp on Tony Gayton's 
   screenplay and never loses his grip, turning in one of the best 
   thrillers of 2002. There's some welcome humor also present, including 
   Adam Goldberg's plan of stealing Bob Hope's stool sample (!) and 
   selling it on eBay. It doesn't turn out well (All This happens while 
   an old guy [Tom Fitzpatrick] in a wheelchair sings &quot;Take A Walk 
   On The Wild Side&quot;) . It also presents the tweaker's life as one 
   of the ugliest lifestyles, living in dirty flophouses filled with 
   puking dopeheads and people who never stop talking. Other acting 
   honors go out to Peter Sarsgaard as Parker's best &quot;friend&quot; 
   Jimmy the Finn, who still stays his friend even when he finds out who 
   Parker really is. It's a scene that would put a lump in anyone's 
   throat who has a pulse. D'Onofrio is a hoot, one part scary bastard 
   and one part sideshow freak (you'll do a double-take when you see him 
   without his fake nose). He's always interesting to watch, going all 
   the way back to his performance as Private Pyle in <B><A HREF="full_metal_jacket_1987.htm">FULL
    METAL JACKET</A></B> (1987). But the film belongs to Val Kilmer, who 
   imbues his characters with a humanity rarely seen in films of this 
   type. You can see that it's a struggle for him to remember his Tom 
   Van Allen life, as he keeps everything that reminds him of that life 
   neatly packed in a suitcase under his bed, occasionally opening it 
   and putting on his suit and fedora and playing his horn to keep the 
   memory of his dead wife alive. While the ending may seem a little pat 
   (I was kind of glad it turned out the way it did, even if it should 
   have ended differently), you'll be totally engrossed in the 
   characters and what happens to them. I don't say this much, but as 
   soon as the movie ended, I wanted to watch it again (I did!). It was 
   even better the second time. Also starring Luis Guzman, Glenn 
   Plummer, Deborah Kara Unger, Danny Trejo, R. Lee Ermey and a

    surgeon Robert Lansing is caught killing his daughter's boyfriend by 
   her, she leaves home and never returns. When Lansing's father passes 
   away and leaves Lansing's daughter (Judith Chapman) five million 
   dollars and the estate, Lansing comes up with a plan to take a beaten-to-a-pulp
    stripper and create her in his daughter's image. He succeeds and 
   teaches her everything there is to know about his daughter and his 
   family in exchange for half of the five million dollars. The only 
   problem is that his real daughter was an accomplished pianist and his 
   fake daughter can't play a lick. This one little tick turns Lansing's 
   life upside down when his real daughter returns and begins her life 
   back at home as if nothing has ever happened. Double and 
   triple-crosses ensue, with a truly satisfying ending that puts all 
   the missing pieces together. I really miss the late Robert Lansing. 
   He always had this cool exterior which covered an even blacker 
   interior. His first starring role was in the interesting horror film <B><A HREF="4d_man_1959.htm">4D
    MAN</A></B> in 1959 (re-released as <B><A HREF="master_of_terror_1965.htm">MASTER
    OF TERROR</A></B> in 1965) and had a long and varied career in films 
   and TV before succumbing to cancer in 1994. When his real daughter 
   returns home, he looks really pleased even though we know that he has 
   a lot of explaining to do. He answers every one of his daughter's 
   questions with answers that sound so honest that we almost forgive 
   him for everything that he's done. He even sets up killings with such 
   pinache and bravado, that he almost seems non-human. Judith Chapman (<B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Dead Space">DEAD
    SPACE</A></B> - 1991) has a field day in her dual role as we never 
   know which one is the more evil of the two. It turns out that they 
   are both equals, both with plans of their own. Throw in some gory 
   plastic surgery footage and enough sleazy action to keep your 
   interest (incest is implied and, in the case of his fake daughter, 
   carried out), toss in some very tricky plotting and what develops is 
   a very satisfying film. I thoroughly enjoyed it and so should you.

   troll the highways in their old Packard looking for young women to

   as sexual playthings under the instructions of their strict mother

    responds, &quot;Once, but Mother didn't approve.&quot; This triggers 
   a flashback where Frank introduces his fianc&eacute;e to his mother 
   (Greta Gayland). Mother instantly disapproves (She fakes heart pains 
   so Frank will massage her breasts) and when Frank is out of earshot, 
   she tells his fianc&eacute;e that she and Frank engage in incest on a 
   regular basis and the fianc&eacute;e runs away, never to be seen 
   again. Mother tells Frank that &quot;all women should be in 
   cages&quot; and from that moment on, that is the way Frank treats 
   women. Back to the present, John wants a new girl to play with, so he 
   and Frank kidnap college girl Bonnie (Cheryl Waters; <B><A HREF="macon_county_line_1974.htm">MACON
    COUNTY LINE</A></B> - 1974, here using the name &quot;Leah 
   Tate&quot;). She is locked in the basement with Ginger and Stevie 
   (who is now near death), but she holds out hope that her boyfriend, 
   college professor Robert (Stafford Morgan; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Alpha Incident">THE
    ALPHA INCIDENT</A></B> - 1978, here using the pseudonym &quot;Robert

   her. Robert finds a piece of evidence that will eventually lead him 
   to Frank and John's home, but the question soon becomes: Will he get 
   there in time before Frank and John ruin her as a woman? Bonnie 
   briefly escapes and discovers the decaying corpse of Frank and John's 
   mother in one of the bedrooms. So who is actually disguising 
   themselves as dear, old Mom? When Robert rescues Bonnie, they both 
   discover Frank has hanged himself and John is whimpering &quot;Mama! 
   Mama!&quot; over-and-over beside his swinging corpse. This is not the 
   ending most viewers of this type of entertainment have come to 
   expect. Whether it is good or bad depends on your tolerance level. 
   Me? I liked it.&nbsp; This is the first directorial effort from Don 
   Jones (he also produced and wrote the screenplay), who later gave us

   (1960) for plot devices, it does have an air of sleaziness that 
   permeates every frame, starting with the creepy opening titles, which 
   show a series of bizarre and ugly dolls while an even creepier song, 
   titled &quot;Triangles, Circles and Squares&quot;, plays in the 
   background. There's also plenty of nudity (including full frontal by

   really carries the film, though, and it's enhanced by a rare starring 
   role from genre vet Gary Kent (also the Production Manager here), who

   topless body. What is the connection between Kathy and &quot;La 
   Toscana&quot;? The Inspector wants to know, too, as he hasn't 
   identified &quot;La Toscana&quot; yet and orders Lt. Palumbo to dig 
   up some info on her so he can have some idea who he is dealing with.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next time we see Giulia and Mario, they are married and 
   traveling by train to have a quick honeymoon. When Mario leaves their 
   compartment to go get a sandwich, the killer strikes, slicing away at 
   Giulia with a straight razor, but the conductor hears the commotion 
   and interrupts the killer before he can leave the half-moon locket. 
   At Giulia's funeral, the police take photos of every male person that 
   attended, thinking the the killer would be there. Mario is able to 
   identify everyone in the photos, except for one (It's a photo of Lt. 
   Renzi [Franco Fantasia; <B><A HREF="#MurderMansion1972">THE MURDER MANSION</A></B> 
   - 1972]; a trick perpetrated by Lt. Palumbo without the Inspector's 
   knowledge). Mario tells the Inspector that he has known Giulia for 
   three years, ever since her father died, and he doesn't believe she 
   has any connection to the two other murdered women, but the Inspector 
   is not so sure. It is at this time that we discover that Giulia is 
   very much alive, her funeral a ploy to get the killer to expose 
   himself. Is it possible that the killer is in the photos that Mario identified?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Giulia is not able to identify Kathy because she didn't know her, 
   but she is able to identify &quot;La Toscana&quot;. Her name was Ines 
   and she worked as a maid at a hotel her father once owned (She was 
   called &quot;La Toscana&quot; because the hotel was in Tuscany). 
   Giulia tells the Inspector that Ines was engaged to Giovanni Rau 
   (Nello Pazzafini; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Contraband1980">CONTRABAND</A></B> 
   - 1980), an unpleasant man who took advantage of Ines' position and 
   stole from the hotel. Giulia and Ines &quot;denounced&quot; Giovanni 
   (whatever that means) and he swore to get even. The Inspector and Lt. 
   Palumbo grill Giovanni (complete with a bright light shining on his 
   face!), but they get nowhere, even though he confesses (but they 
   don't believe him).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Giulia and Mario then go on a trip, where he gives her a half-moon 
   keychain and tells her it was a present from the Inspector (WTF?!?). 
   Giulia looks at the keychain and tells Mario that she recognizes it. 
   It looks exactly the same as a keychain left on a table at her 
   father's hotel two years earlier. All she can remember about the man 
   who left it was that he was American, tall, young, but his face 
   escapes her. She knows he wasn't a client of the hotel, as he would 
   only eat there every once in a while. Giulia also remembers he lived 
   in a resident's hotel on the River Del Sole. Mario postpones their 
   trip and they head to the resident's hotel, where Mario pretends to 
   be a private investigator and grills the hotel manager. Mario gets 
   nowhere, but Giulia gets an idea to check the hotel's registry books 
   since, by law, they have to keep them for five years. She hopes 
   seeing the American's name will trigger an identity in her mind (It's 
   a good plan). Giulia remembers it was the end of the season, in 
   September or October of 1969, but when she and Mario look at the 
   books, the page for September 29, 1969 is missing. Is the killer that 
   intelligent to get rid of any evidence that can identify him? Giulia 
   and Mario are shocked to discover that Kathy Adams stayed at the 
   hotel on September 28 &amp; 30, so she must have been there on the 
   29th. Did she remove the page and, if she did, why? Giulia and Mario 
   are able to deduce that seven women (including Giulia) were at the 
   hotel that weekend in 1969 and two of them are dead (three if you 
   count Giulia). Is it possible that the other four women, Anita Ferri, 
   Elena Marchi, Concetta De Rosa and Anna Sartori, are next on the 
   killer's list? A priest (Renato Romano; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#SecretDorianGray70">THE
    SECRET OF DORIAN GRAY</A></B> - 1970) turns up every once in a while 
   to supply Mario and Giulia with vital information, but why does it 
   always sound like a warning?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We discover that Elena Marchi (Rossella Falk; <B><A HREF="#BlackBellyTarantula">BLACK
    BELLY OF THE TARANTULA</A></B> - 1971) is in an insane asylum and 
   believes the Devil wants to kill her. Anita Ferri died a year ago of 
   natural causes. Concetta De Rosa (Petra Sch&uuml;rmann; <B><A HREF="school_of_fear_1969.htm">SCHOOL
    OF FEAR</A></B> - 1969) lives in Palermo and Anna Sartori (Marisa 
   Mell; <B><A HREF="marta_1971.htm">MARTA</A></B> - 1971) married the 
   wealthy Palmieri (Ivano Davoli) and are currently touring Australia. 
   Mario deduces that Elena is the next person on the killer's list, so 
   he and Giulia head for the asylum, but they are too late, as the 
   killer has made his way into Elena's room and drowns her in the 
   bathtub (an incredibly tense scene). The killer attacks Mario, 
   stabbing him in the arm and Giulia sees the killer fleeing. The 
   Inspector, who has two policemen stand guard over Giulia and Mario, 
   goes to Palermo to talk to Concetta, who is a school teacher. Mario 
   ditches the police and talks to Raffaele Ferri (Claudio Gora; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#MadDog1977">MAD
    DOG</A></B> - 1977), the widower of the deceased Anita, and comes up 
   with a drawing of the American based on Raffaele's memory (He looks 
   like Charlie Brown!). Mario begins showing the drawing on the 
   streets, where a beggar notices him as a friend of Barrett (Bruno 
   Corazzari; <B><A HREF="#StrangeViceWardh71">THE STRANGE VICE OF MRS. WARDH</A></B> 
   - 1971), a man who throws sleazy sex parties. Mario finds Barrett at 
   one of his sex parties and he tells Mario that the American's name is 
   Frank Saunders, but he hasn't seen him since July of 1969, when Frank 
   got &quot;hung up on some chick&quot; and then disappeared. Concetta 
   goes to church for Confessional and when the Inspector realizes it 
   was a trap set up by the killer, he races to the church (another 
   incredibly tense scene), only to find Concetta dead in the 
   confessional, strangled with a half-moon locket in her hand. Mario 
   gets close to finding Frank and when he gets too close, the killer 
   calls him on the phone and sets up a meeting. Mario discovers the 
   grave marker of Frank Saunders in a cemetery, who died on September 
   30, 1969. Beneath the headstone lie seven orchids stained with red 
   and Mario asks the cemetery custodian who left the orchids. He 
   doesn't know, but he tells Mario this is the first time anyone has 
   visited Frank's grave since he died. Mario discovers Frank died in a 
   car accident just outside of Rome and the unknown woman driving the 
   car that killed Frank left the scene, making his death a murder. 
   Meanwhile, the Inspector meets Anna Sartori and her husband at the 
   airport, as they have just returned from Australia.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   will have your eyes wide open. As a matter of fact, when Anna is 
   murdered by the killer with a Black &amp; Decker electric drill, it 
   is the most brutal murder in the film and it took me by surprise 
   because it was unlike any other killing before it. Particularly 
   effective is the sequence where the killer stalks Giulia when he 
   finds out she is still alive. My fingernails were never shorter, 
   because I was biting them constantly (The death of the killer in 
   Mario's huge underground swimming pool is a real nail-biter!). Above 
   all, the mystery makes perfect sense, as the story (Screenplay by 
   Lenzi &amp; Roberto Gianviti [<B><A HREF="#DontTortureDuck72">DON'T

   make it?&quot;). The killer follows her home and then stabs her to 
   death with a knife hidden in a cane. We are then introduced to Pedro

   knee during an act he performed with his wife at a circus. When his 
   cheating wife is the next one killed by the gloved psycho, Pedro is 
   questioned by Scotland Yard Commissioner Campbell (Renzo Marignano). 
   The murdered women have had some vital organs surgically removed, 
   which makes this case similar to the Jack The Ripper murders in the 
   late 1800's. Just like in that unsolved series of murders, the killer 
   begins sending Commissioner Campbell a series of taunting letters. As 
   more women are killed and their organs removed, we are introduced to 
   more characters, one who could be the killer, including Co<A HREF="7_murders_for_scotland_yard_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/7 murders for scotland yard dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="176" HEIGHT="246" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>mmissioner
    Campbell's best friend, Winston (Andres Resino), a school teacher, 
   where one of his female students is killed in the school's gymnasium. 
   Commissioner Campbell still believes Pedro is the culprit because his 
   alibis are too good to be true and Pedro also has two years of 
   medical training. The police get a phone call from &quot;Jack The 
   Ripper&quot;, who gives them an address to where his latest victim is 
   located. When the police arrive, they find a drunk Pedro in bed with 
   a murdered prostitute, her liver missing. Pedro manages to get away 
   (using his trapeze training), but is shot and injured when he runs 
   away. Commissioner Campbell (who was mysteriously missing during 
   Pedro's near-arrest) professes his love to best friend Winston's 
   wife, Sandy (Orchidea DeSantis), and then receives a package at his 
   office that contains the head of the Ripper's latest victim, her eyes 
   missing. The gloved killer then kidnaps Sandy and Commissioner 
   Campbell questions Winston, who then confronts him about his 
   impotency (&quot;Life has played a dirty trick on you!&quot;). 
   Winston accuses Campbell of having an affair with Sandy, but he 
   denies it. Pedro tries to find out who the real killer is, while 
   various lowlifes try to kill him for a reward (He ends up stabbing a 
   couple of them to death, which doesn't help his case). Campbell 
   receives another body part in the mail and the killer claims that it 
   belongs to Sandy. Is Sandy really dead and who is responsible for all 
   these killings? Eagle-eyed viewers should have this figured out long 
   before the film ends. This Spanish/Italian giallo, directed by Jose 
   Luis Madrid (<B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#HorribleSexyVamp70">THE
    HORRIBLE SEXY VAMPIRE</A></B> - 1970), here billed as &quot;J.L.

   body of work at the time (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Werewolf Shadow">WEREWOLF

    OF THE MORGUE</A></B> - 1973). The murders aren't particularly gory 
   (just a couple of close-ups of knife blades penetrating the skin) and 
   the mystery is not very compelling or difficult to figure out. 
   Although Naschy is top-billed, he really doesn't have much to do here 
   besides drink heavily, get into a couple of fights and show off his 
   barrel chest on several occasions. Besides some excellent on-location 
   photography of swinging early-70's London and a few POV shots of the 
   killer stabbing his victims, this film is a rather dry affair that 
   cuts away just before any nudity is shown (which is strange, 
   considering that many of the murders are committed on prostitutes, 
   but this may be the Spanish cut and not the Continental version, 
   which allowed more nudity to be shown). Although not a bad film, it's 
   not as bloody or as sexy as we've come to expect from the films that 
   Paul Naschy was involved in (he wrote the screenplay using his real 
   name, Jacinto Molina, along with Madrid and Tito Carpi). Also known

   &quot;Jack Stuart&quot;; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#KillBabyKill1966">KILL,
    BABY...KILL!</A></B> - 1966), an imposing man with a huge scar

   town, going into a pharmacy and asking<A HREF="shadow_of_death_1969.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/shadow of death amazon poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="228" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   the pharmacist for an aspirin. After making some small talk with him, 
   Gert exits and then enters a side door that leads to the apartment 
   above the pharmacy, rings the doorbell, enters the apartment and 
   surprises Denise (Teresa Gimpera; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Crypt of Living Dea">CRYPT
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> - 1973), who stares at his facial scar 
   and gloved left hand, which is useless to him. Gert tells Denise that 
   he threatened to come here if they didn't reach an agreement and by 
   looking at all the expensive furniture and paintings in the 
   apartment, it's obvious she is well off. Gert tells her he is not 
   doing too well, saying, &quot;I had an accident that changed me a 
   little, as you can see.&quot; He tells Denise that she is still 
   beautiful and has hardly changed in the four years since he last saw 
   her. Denise tells him to get to the point and tell her what he wants. 
   Gert says that during those four years his business has not worked 
   very well for him, so he thought she could help him. Denise says 
   under no circumstances will she help him, continuing with, &quot;You 
   don't have the right to demand anything from me.&quot; We then see 
   that the pharmacist, John (Larry Ward; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Deathhead Virgin">THE
    DEATHHEAD VIRGIN</A></B> - 1974), is actually Denise's husband, as 
   we watch him close up shop and head upstairs to the apartment. When 
   John walks in, Denise tells him she isn't going to introduce him to 
   Gert, as she spoke about him many times, telling John that she was 
   once Gert's mistress and he has come here to blackmail her. Gert 
   tells John that his wife is mistaken, he only came here to ask for 
   help, but John is not buying it, telling Gert to get out and never 
   come back. As Gert is walking out, he turns around and smiles at the 
   couple, tipping his hat to the both of them (For some reason never 
   explained, the camera is very interested in Gert's black fedora, 
   especially the colorful feather tucked in the headband, which is 
   actually the opening shot in the film). What is Gert up to and why 
   did Denise tell her husband about him? Is there more here than meets 
   the eye? Count on it!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    John wants to know what in the hell is going on (apparently, Denise 
   was bluffing [i.e. lying] and never talked about Gert to her 
   husband), so she tells John that she met Gert in Algeria when she was 
   a dancer. Gert had several businesses, but his main business was 
   trafficking in weapons. She was all alone in Algeria and one thing 
   led to another, so they became lovers. John says to her that she 
   should have told him about this before now, but Denise calmly says 
   (almost too calmly), &quot;Why should I have told you? It was an 
   unimportant episode in my life.&quot; John asks her if there is 
   anything important in her life, so Denise walks up to him, puts her 
   arms around his neck and whispers, &quot;Us.&quot; I get the feeling 
   that Denise is not being truthful to her husband. If she were, the 
   film would be over, as everything I described to you happens in the 
   first nine minutes!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As Gert is leaving town, he stops at a gas station to get some 
   petrol and discovers John has an identical twin brother named Peter 
   (also portrayed by Larry Ward) and, as we can see by the look on 
   Gert's face, he has come up with a plan to take advantage of the 
   situation. He begins following Peter around and both Gert (and us 
   viewers) discover that Denise is having an affair with Peter. Denise 
   tells Peter that whenever she is close to John she feels disgusted, 
   Peter asking her why she married John and wondering since he and John 
   look exactly alike if she is disgusted with him, too? Denise tells 
   Peter he is different than John, he has something that is 
   &quot;special to her and the only reason she married John was because 
   he gave her a bit of security, so she decided to &quot;try&quot; 
   marriage (In other words, Denise is a filthy golddigger). Denise 
   wants Peter to kill his brother and refuses to make love to him until 
   he does. When Peter asks if Denise's body is a sufficient price tro 
   commit murder, she says, &quot;And I fear that you're not man enough 
   for me&quot; (Yeah, it's a real loving relationship). Just then the 
   phone rings and a laughing Gert is on the other end, telling Peter he 
   knows he is having an affair with Denise, giving him five days to pay 
   him 200,000 pesetas, saying he will be at the ferry entrance for the 
   next five days at 11:00PM and if he doesn't pay him the money, he 
   will tell John about the affair. when Gert Hangs up the phone, Peter 
   turns to Deniose and says, &quot;I feared so. Your lies have been 
   exposed.&quot; Denise says she is glad it happened, now Peter really 
   has to kill his brother to get the money needed to pay Gert. Denise 
   also tells Peter that he didn't study medicine and drug interactions 
   for nothing, so he has to go through with their plan and she will 
   deal with Gert. Something tells me that this isn't going to end well 
   for anyone involved.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Long story short, Peter and Denise inject John with insulin, putting 
   him in a coma (They don't kill him. though, keeping him in a coma 
   until their entire dastardly plan comes to fruition) and Peter takes 
   John's identity by wearing his clothes and jewelry (such as his 
   wedding ring). Their entire plan is straight out of the Corsican 
   Brothers (You know what they say about twins, that they can see 
   through each other's eyes and feel each other's pain plan, so 
   everything Peter does with John's identity, John believes he actually 
   did it. Pretty thin plan if you ask me.). The only difference between 
   the twin brothers is that John is an epileptic prone to seizures.

   OF A WOMAN</A></B> - 1971), making love to her and letting it be 
   known that it is John doing the deed, sullying his name. Peter then 
   goes to the ferry to hear Gert's terms and when Gert threatens to 
   tell John about the affair, Peter puts on John's wedding ring and 
   tells Gert he is actually John. Gert doesn't believe Peter, pulling a 
   gun on him, but Peter manages to grab the gun away&nbsp; and later 
   shoots Gert point-blank, killing him (while Denise calmly watches). 
   But is Gert actually dead? Things get really nasty when the lovebirds 
   wake up John (by using electro-shock treatment on him!) and tell him 
   that he killed a man and was seen making love to Annie. John 
   initially believes them (he sees all the acts through Peter's eyes) 
   and turns himself into the police, showing the Police Commissioner 
   (Fernando S&aacute;nchez Polack; <B><A HREF="vengeance_of_the_zombies_1972.htm">VENGEANCE
    OF THE ZOMBIES</A></B> - 1973) where he hid Gert's body. When they 
   get there, Gert's corpse is not there, so the police think he is 
   going insane. Someone then murders Annie and John thinks he is 
   responsible, so he takes the Commissioner to Annie's apartment, but 
   her body is also not there. Now the police believe he is certifiably 
   bonkers and the only one to believe him is his old friend Dr. 
   Hernandez (Javier de Rivera; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DraculaSaga1973">THE
    DRACULA SAGA</A></B> - 1973), who tries to prove John's innocence.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The finale comes when John meets Gert on a train car and a fight 
   ensues, John being tossed out of the train car and killed by an 
   oncoming train. Gert then pays Denise a visit, but it is not Gert at 
   all, but Peter wearing a rubber mask with a scar to look like Gert 
   (Dr. Hernandez finds Gert's corpse in a hidden freezer). Yes this was 
   the plan Peter and Denise cooked up, but, wait, it's not over yet. 
   After Denise tells Peter that their plan worked like a charm, Peter 
   has a seizure, proving he is not Peter at all, but John! John 
   discovered that Peter was wearing a mask to look like Gert, so he 
   pulled the mask off Peter, put it on himself and killed Peter by 
   pushing him into the path of an oncoming train.&nbsp; John grabs an 
   escaping Denise by the ankle and won't let her leave, as police 
   sirens get closer and closer. <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">THE END</FONT></B>.<A HREF="shadow_of_death_1969.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/shadow of death spain poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A></FONT></FONT><BR>

    This ridiculous bit of fluff was directed by Javier Set&oacute; (as 
   &quot;Xavier Set&oacute;&quot;), who had been making movies since the 
   early 1950's, this one being his penultimate film, as he died in 1969 
   at the age of 43 (causes unknown). This seems to be his only 
   semi-giallo film in his cannon, as most of his other productions seem 
   to be Spanish comedies or romance dramas. The screeenplay is 
   especially maddening, since it was co-written by such well-known 
   names in giallo cinema, Santiago Moncada (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#FourthVictim1971">THE

   conjunction with Set&oacute; on the script. To say the conclusion of 
   the film is a total cheat on the audience is a vast understatement, 
   as it negates everything that came before it. Nothing gels here, like 
   the scripters wrote themselves into a corner and pulled this solution 
   out of their ass. While there is a little bit of nudity here, mainly 
   quick glimpses of Silvana Venturelli's naked breasts as she is making 
   love to Peter, there is no bloody violence at all, a major sin for a 
   film of this type. If they were hoping the plot would make up for the 
   lack of violence, they were sadly mistaken, as everything that came 
   before the ridiculous finale was your standard plot that could be 
   seen on any detective TV series at the time. In other words, nothing 
   here is surprising or much of a mystery, as everything is exposed to 
   viewers long before the stupid ending. This film actually spits on 
   your expectations and I can't recommend it to any reader of this 
   site. It's instantly forgettable and that's about the nicest thing I 
   can say about it.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    A park sweeper in Prague (filmed on location) finds the dead body of 
   American Gregory Moore (Jean Sorel; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#LizardWomansSkin">LIZARD
    IN A WOMAN'S SKIN</A></B> - 1971) and reports it to the police, who 
   take his body to the morgue. Only, he's not really dead. His body may 
   be dead , but his brain is very much alive, as he tries to remember 
   how he ended up this way. The film then travels back in time, as his 
   fragmented memory tries to unravel the mystery of why his girlfriend, 
   Mira (Barbara Bach; <B><A HREF="#BlackBellyTarantula">BLACK BELLY OF 
   THE TARANTULA</A></B> - 1971), disappeared without a trace. George is 
   a newspaper reporter from the United States, who is doing a story on 
   this country's corrupt government, which is being influenced by 
   Russia. Mira arrives by train and Gregory want to be with her always, 
   but Mira is in Prague on a temporary visa. They cavort in a cemetery, 
   have dinner at a fancy expensive restaurant and then make love back 
   at Gregory's apartment. Gregory wants to take her back to the United 
   States, but her country won't let him. It's easy to see that they are 
   very much in love. Mira even jokingly (?) says that she wishes 
   Gregory would &quot;smuggle&quot; her to America. One night, Gregory 
   gets the feeling that they are being watched (they are). We then 
   discover that Mira is an amateur entomologist, her specialty 
   butterflies, a collection of them hanging on a wall in Gregory's 
   apartment (Remember, even the smallest of details may point to 
   something big in giallo films).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Every so often, we are back at the morgue, where Gregory's body is 
   being stored in a freezer, the morgue attendants putting more bodies 
   in there, as Gregory tries to talk to them to see if they are able to 
   communicate with him, but they don't answer (it gets much more tense 
   as the film progresses). Back in the past, Gregory brings Mira to a 
   fancy black tie affair, where friends Jacques&nbsp; (Mario Adorf; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Manhunt1972">MANHUNT</A></B> 
   - 1972) and Ivan (Relja Basic) fawn over her, but prudish Jessica 
   (Ingrid Thulin; <B><A HREF="salon_kitty_1976.htm">SALON KITTY</A></B> 
   - 1976), who is in love with Gregory, wonders out loud why Gregory 
   would bring this &quot;bitch&quot; to such a fancy party (she turns 
   up her nose to &quot;commoners&quot;). After having drinks alone with 
   Jacques, Gregory goes home, but Mira is not there. The bed has been 
   slept in, yet all her clothes and her pocketbook, containing her 
   passport, are still in his apartment. Gregory is worried, because no 
   one walks around Prague without their passport, so Gregory goes to 
   Jacques, Ivan and Jessica for some help. Jacques reports that no one 
   resembling Mira is in the hospital or morgue, so Gregory reports her 
   disappearance to the police, where Commishioner Kierkoff (Piero Vida; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Stage Fright">STAGEFRIGHT</A></B> 
   - 1987) takes over the investigation. He questions Gregory as if he 
   were a suspect (he doesn't like &quot;foreign&quot; reporters) and 
   Gregory tells him if he doesn't take this seriously, he'll write a 
   story accusing the government and the police of murder (now I see why 
   he doesn't like foreign reporters!). Jacques gets word of a young 
   woman found naked and murdered by the river and George is relieved to 
   see that it is not Mira when he goes to indentify the body.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Meanwhile, the morgue attendants discover that Gregory's body is 
   still warm, so a doctor (Daniele Dublino; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#KillerNun1978">KILLER
    NUN</A></B> - 1978) tries to revive him, but fails. We then have to 
   wonder if Gregory's investigation of the disappearance of Mira is 
   related to his current condition. Was he drugged or poisoned with 
   some unknown substance? Back in the past, Gregory's&nbsp; 
   investigation leads him to one of Mira's relatives, a skittish woman 
   with numerous clocks hanging on her walls of her apartment, but 
   before he can question her, a fat bald man appears and slams the door 
   in Gregory's face. As Gregory gets deeper into his investigation, he 
   discovers that many young women have disappeared and some of them 
   were later found naked and murdered, like the young woman he saw 
   previously. Pretty soon, his investigation becomes less about Mira 
   and more about the string of disappearances and murders. The closer 
   he gets to the reason why they disappeared, the more dangerous it 
   becomes to Gregory. Everyone he talks to ends up dead, like Valinski 
   (Jos&eacute; Quaglio; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#EyeBehindTheWall">THE 
   EYE BEHIND THE WALL</A></B> - 1977), who is tossed off a bridge into 
   the path of an oncoming train.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Back at the morgue, the doctor tries to revive Gregory by giving him 
   a blood transfusion, but it, too, doesn't work. George still doesn't 
   know how he ended up &quot;dead&quot;, but he begins to have flashes 
   of fragmented memory, some of them involving his neighbor Natassja 
   (Semka Sokolovic). Will Gregory discover the truth before he really 
   dies? What does the blind Professor Karting (Fabijan Sovagovic) have 
   to do with it? (We see the dead naked body of Mira in one of his 
   rooms, covered in flowers. Is it real or in the Professor's sightless 
   mind?) Do Gregory's friends know more than they are saying?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Like all good giallo films, the center of the mystery deals with 
   something sexual and sordid. Director/screenwriter Aldo Lado (the 
   person responsible for the films I mentioned in the beginning of this 
   review) ladles on the suspense here, as the mystery gets more complex 
   as the film progresses. Not only do we want to know the how and why 
   of Mira's disappearance, we also want to know if Gregory survives his 
   ordeal. At first, we feel sympathy for Gregory, as his investigation 
   gets him into plenty of dangerous situations, but when he sleeps with 
   Jessica, we don't quite feel the same for him as we do for Mira. Yes, 
   it was a temporary indiscretion, but it is an unforgivable one, 
   because Jessica only thinks about herself and even Gregory knows it. 
   So why did he sleep with her? Director Lado also tosses in some 
   unusual sights and sounds. There's the legless bum, who pushes 
   himself through the streets of Prague on a cart. When he notices the 
   body of Gregory in the park, he says to the park sweeper,<A HREF="short_night_of_glass_dolls_1971_foreign_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/short night of glass dolls italy poster6 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="191" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   &quot;You don't think that I did it, do you?&quot;. There's also a 
   lifelike doll that Jacques shows Gregory at the fancy party, who 
   seemingly comes to life and hits on Gregory when he and Jacques are 
   having drinks. But the most telling is a street singer (J&uuml;rgen 
   Drews), who sings a song titled &quot;Short Night Of The 
   Butterflies&quot; (an alternate title to this film) and if you listen 
   very carefully to the lyrics, it will give you a major clue as to 
   what is going on. All good giallo films are about the audience 
   gathering clues to solve the mystery and this film is full of brain 
   candy. Even Gregory's mysterious condition takes some brainpower to 
   solve, which is why I love giallo films so much. They are a feast for 
   the eyes and the mind if they are done right, such as this one. This 
   film ranks in the upper 10% of excellent giallo films, especially 
   when Gregory discovers why Mira disappeared. When you see why, you'll 
   be knocked for a loop (lots of naked flesh is involved, of all ages). 
   Like all good giallo films, the finale is not a happy one. The doctor 
   is using Gregory's bady as a teaching tool for medical students, 
   showing them the proper way to conduct an autopsy. When the scalpel 
   reaches Gregory's chest, Jessica, who is in the audience, sees his 
   hand move and she screams, the film ending with her scream. Did 
   Gregory survive? That all depends on you. That's all I am going to 
   say, because you should experience the mystery for yourself. I 
   guarantee you will be entertained, giallo fan or not.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   is a strange bird, who doesn't want to be touched and will not let 
   her sister open her suitcase. Once in their room, Dagmar strips 
   completely naked in front of Ursula, but Ursula is not glad to be 
   here. While Dagmar is having a drink in the hotel's picturesque patio 
   (the view is to kill for), hotel manager Roberto Delleri (Vanni

   Stella Shining (Yvonne Harlow) sings every night. Roberto keeps the 
   nightclub open in the off-season just for Stella. He takes Dagmar and 
   Ursula to the nightclub, where they watch Stella perform. Roberto 
   introduces the sisters to the handsome Filippo Andrei (Marc Porel; <B><A HREF="#DontTortureDuck72">DON'T

   hand. When Dagmar tells Filippo that she and her sister are Austrian, 
   Ursula quickly cuts her off, snottily telling her sister that she 
   didn't come here to talk to strangers about their family. Just why is 
   Ursula here? Roberto introduces the sisters to Stella and Ursula 
   not-so-politely leaves, telling everyone that she is tired and Dagmar 
   reluctantly goes with her. What is Ursula's problem? Filippo tells 
   Stella that he wants to sleep with her, but she begs off, telling him 
   that she is tired. He accuses her of sleeping with someone else. What 
   is Filippo's problem? Back at their hotel room, Ursula complains that 
   she doesn't want to be here and mentions their father. She also 
   accuses Dagmar of wanting to sleep with Filippo. Dagmar gives Ursula

   that they are not alone. Someone is hiding behind the curtains 
   watching their every move. She pays the man for a job well done and 
   he leaves (This is the first time I ever saw a hooker pay a john!). 
   The peeper comes into the room (all we see are the peeper's eyes and 
   black gloves) and we learn that the hooker knew he was there watching

    Ursula screams, waking up her sister, as she has had a bad 
   nightmare. The following morning, Roberto tells the sisters that 
   something terrible has happened, as a prostitute was killed in her 
   room last night. The story has already made the newspapers and when 
   Ursula looks at a photo on the front page, where the hooker is naked 
   and spread-eagle on the floor, she passes out (where can I subscribe 
   to this newspaper?!?). Ursula wakes up in the office of a 
   psychologist (Giancarlo Zanetti) and his assistant Vanessa (Anna 
   Zinnemann; <B><A HREF="bloodstained_butterfly_1971_foreign_ads.htm">THE
    BLOODSTAINED BUTTERFLY</A></B> - 1971). Ursula flinches when Vanessa 
   goes to touch her and she tells Dagmar that they are leaving the 
   hotel. Roberto assures her that there is no danger, as the police 
   arrested the hooker's boyfriend in what he calls a crime of jealously 
   (&quot;The green-eyed monster, as Shakespeare put it&quot;). Ursula 
   doesn't want to hear it. She goes to her room and packs her bag, with 
   Dagmar calling her &quot;rude, unpleasant and hateful. And you're 
   incredibly selfish&quot; and wonders why she follows Ursula around. 
   Ursula apologizes and tells Dagmar that she doesn't know why she can 
   &quot;see things in others that they'd rather not see&quot;&nbsp; and

    We watch as Filippo follows a man around, stealing his datebook when 
   he is not looking. Roberto tells Dagmar and Stella that Filippo left 
   early this morning to check out some land for his company, but Dagmar 
   tells Roberto that just can't be because she saw Filippo just a short 
   time ago. What is Filippo up to? Ursula decides not to leave and she 
   and Dagmar have a long talk, where we leard that their mother shipped 
   them off to boarding school when they were very young. Ursula hasn't 
   seen her mother since she was five years-old and their father was a 
   womanizer. When he died, he left two women, Corrine Chauvet and 
   Valeria Monetti, a paltry piece of his fortune (&quot;Our father died 
   all alone. All alone&quot; says Ursula). When Dagmar asks her sister 
   how she knew the names of the two women, Ursula says, &quot;I just 
   know things...even before they happen.&quot; Ursula then says that 
   their mother is shacked-up with another man far away and their father 
   must never find out. Is Ursula crazy or is she actually psychic?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Ursula and Dagmar go to a rustic old church, where Ursula talks 
   crazy to a faceless metal statue of Christ (She keeps mentioning the 
   &quot;eyes&quot; and how everyone look through his eyes.). Stella 
   then walks in on Filippo as he is about to inject his arm with some 
   heroin and she walks away in disgust (Marc Porel was a real-life drug 
   addict who died in 1983 at the age of 34). But how can Filippo be in 
   two places at once since we just saw him entering a business with the 
   datebook? (Think about it). Two young lovers enter the hotel to get a 
   room, but when Roberto tells them that the hotel is booked-up, they 
   refuse to leave. We watch them make love in the hotel's basement, 
   when the black-gloved killer strikes again, slicing the young man's 
   throat and killing the young woman with an unknown weapon (Again, a 
   shadow on the wall makes it look like the killer has a big dick and 
   the woman looks at it and screams).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While Dagmar is walking with Filippo, Ursula, who is walking behind 
   them, passes out, later telling Dagmar that she saw her father with 
   two naked women. Why does seeing this make her pass out? And why does 
   Filippo interrogate Roberto on if Stella has a man? We then learn it 
   is Roberto who is screwing Stella and he is growing increasingly 
   jealous when he discovers that Stella has a lesbian lover named Jenny 
   (Antinisca Nemour; <B><A HREF="teenage_prostitution_racket_1975_italy_ads.htm">TEENAGE
    PROSTITUTION RACKET</A></B> - 1975). What does this have to do with 
   the rest of the film? Are the killer's murders random, as Roberto and 
   the police believe? Is something supernatural happening to Ursula? 
   All these questions and many others you may come up with are answered 
   in this review, so put on your thinking caps and concentrate very 
   hard. All the answers are within reach.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Director/screenwriter Enzo Milioni (<B><A HREF="escape_from_death_1989.htm">ESCAPE
    FROM DEATH</A></B> - 1989) gives us plenty of graphic nudity and 
   sex, pushing this film not-so-gently into X-Rated territory, such as 
   the scene of Ursula masturbating with a large gold necklace. Be aware 
   that there is just as much male full-frontal nudity as there is 
   female (The young man killed in the basement is so skinny, his penis 
   looks like a Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage link!). If I had one 
   problem with this film, it is with Milioni's screenplay. It takes 
   forever to get to the killings and when it is revealed what the 
   killer's weapon of choice is, it's anti-climatic (Think of Anthony 
   Perkins in director Ken Russell's <B><A HREF="crimes_of_passion_1984.htm">CRIMES
    OF PASSION</A></B> - 1984). The killer only strikes when the victims 
   just got laid, which is a cheat on the audience. We never see the 
   killer using the weapon of choice and when the killer is unmasked, I<A HREF="sister_of_ursula_1978_foreign_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/sister of ursula italy poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   groaned loudly, because it wasn't much of a surprise, but maybe I am 
   growing jaded from watching too many giallo films, even though it's a 
   favorite genre of mine. The music, by Mim&igrave; Uva, is 
   appropiately creepy and atmospheric (sax solos for the love scenes 
   and violin-heavy orchestral tracks when the killer strikes). When the 
   hotel psychologist (This hotel has a Psychologist? Wow!) explains the 
   supernatural to Dagmar (it is quite ridiculous), you will either 
   laugh or throw your hands up in frustration. Still, if it's nudity 
   you want, look no further than this film. It is so much better than 
   the similarly-themed <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#PlayMotel1979">PLAY MOTEL</A></B>

    Filmed as <B><A HREF="sister_of_ursula_1978_foreign_ads.htm">LA 
   SORELLA DI URSULA</A></B> (a literal translation of the review 
   title), this film was never released theatrically or on VHS in the 
   United States. The DVD, from <A HREF="http://www.severin-films.com">Severin
    Films</A>, is uncut, in widescreen and it looks great (it's in 
   Italian with English subtitles). I say it's uncut because that is 
   what it says on the DVD sleeve, but I got the impression that some of 
   the deaths were edited, as there is a noticeable jump in the music 
   track. If there is a more complete version out there, I would be 
   seriously interested in viewing it. As always, Severin supplies some 
   interesting extras on the disc, including the Italian trailer (it is 
   sex-heavy and contains some scenes that are not in the film) and a 
   thirty minute interview with Enzo Milioni, who has some interesting 
   stories to tell about the making of the film and the actors in it (do 
   not watch this interview before viewing the film, as he gives away 
   many of the film's spoilers). The producers (Armando &amp; Francesco 
   Bertuccioli; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#MadDog1977">MAD DOG</A></B> - 
   1977) inserted some hardcore footage into the film without Milioni's 
   permission or knowledge. When he went to a theater to see this 
   version, he said that it ruined the supernatural mystery of the film, 
   as the hardcore footage was inserted at all the wrong moments and ran 
   contrary to Ursula's visions. He made the producers remove the 
   hardcore footage and those inserts are now considered lost. It was 
   actually filmed at a real hotel but, for some reason, it never opened 
   for business. Milioni tells us that it is a pizza joint now. He also 
   tells a touching story about the tragic life and death of Marc Porel 
   and how it affected Barbara Magnolfi, who was his girlfriend (they 
   have a daughter together). You can tell by the look in Milioni's eyes 
   how Porel's death affected him and ruined Magnolfi's career (she 
   disappeared for quite some time and didn't take any acting roles 
   until years later). Milioni still owns the killer's weapon and gladly 
   shows it to us! A nice interview from a man who offers no apologies 
   for the film (nor should he). Also starring Alice Gherardi &amp; 
   Roberto De Ruggeriis as the young couple killed in the basement. Once

    genre films</A> of the 70's &amp; 80's, whether it be horror,

   pieces (slaughtered to Hell, if it were), missing good healthy pieces 
   of sex, nudity and gore which made these films special in the first 
   place, just to obtain an R-Rating. <B><A HREF="slaughter_hotel_1971c.htm">SLAUGHTER

   theatrical distributor in 1973, it was missing over 5 minutes of 
   footage, and when it was re-released to theaters a few years later, 
   it was missing 10 minutes (some VHS and budget DVD versions using the 
   title <B><A HREF="asylum_erotica_1971.htm">ASYLUM EROTICA</A></B> 
   were the version missing 10 minutes of footage). When <B><A HREF="slaughter_hotel_1971b.htm">SLAUGHTER
    HOTEL</A></B> was released to U.S. theaters in 1973, it was 
   advertised as some sort of telling of the then-famous Richard Speck 
   murders of eight innocent nurses, but that couldn't be farther from 
   the truth.&nbsp; Which is why it is such a joy to finally see these 
   films in their original, uncut Italian versions, thanks to DVD &amp; 
   Blu-Ray, so we get the full meaning of the films. The film opens with 
   a mysterious figure in black, complete with cape, hood and gloves (a 
   giallo staple), as we watch him break into a castle-like female 
   clinic (actually a mental institution), where he goes into a room 
   full of medieval weapons (don't ask me why a mental institution has a 
   medieval weapons room, but it does!) picks up a hand axe and heads up 
   the velvet-roped stairs. He spies a totally nude Anne (Rosalba Neri; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LadyFrankenstein">LADY
    FRANKENSTEIN</A></B> - 1971) writhing in bed, as the camera lovingly 
   gives us close-ups of Anne's vagina (while the frenetic editing of 
   the killer's POV is shown in every direction possible, to convey his 
   mentally off-balanced nature). Just as he is about to kill Anne, the 
   morning alarm and lights go on, as nurses pushing trays of medication 
   fill the hallways, forcing the unseen killer to retreat. We then 
   witness Ruth (Gioia Desideri), who is unwillingly being driven to the 
   &quot;clinic&quot; by her husband, who tells her that her doctors in 
   Switzerland ordered her to stay a few weeks in this clinic for rest 
   and relaxation because it has a very good recovery rate. Ruth calls 
   it a &quot;loony bin&quot; and grabs the steering wheel, nearly 
   driving her and her husband into oncoming traffic. Her husband gets 
   control of the steering wheel in time and once they make it to the 
   clinic, he angrily dumps her off and drives away, saying &quot;I'll 
   see you next week.&quot; When a male orderly tries to take her to her 
   room, Ruth grabs a log and tries to hit him over the head, but this 
   orderly has seen every trick imaginable and pulls the log out of her 
   hand. Yes, Ruth has some major anger issues. As a matter of fact, 
   every woman in this clinic, whether patient or nurse, have issues of 
   their own. Patient Anne is a stark raving nymphomaniac (she has a 
   long freak-out scene in the shower in the beginning of the film which 
   leaves nothing to the imagination). Cheryl (Margaret Lee; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#SecretDorianGray70">DORIAN
    GRAY</A></B> - 1970) tried to kill herself and her husband (Piero 
   Nistri) wants her to be released immediately because she has power of 
   attorney of a thriving business (My &quot;fishiness alarm&quot; just 
   went off!). Mara (Jane Garret) has Daddy issues and has spent much of 
   her young life at the clinic because her father travels all over the 
   world. These women, and many more, are under the care of Professor 
   Osterman (John Karlsen; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Church1989">THE CHURCH</A></B> 
   - 1989) and his assistant, Dr. Francis Clay (a restrained Klaus 
   Kinski; <B><A HREF="schizoid_1980.htm">SCHIZOID</A></B> - 1980). It's 
   also apparent that some of the nurses are lesbians and quite like 
   their jobs, as they touch their female patients' naughty bits while 
   giving them massages (the cameraman must really love his job because 
   he spends an awful lot of time focusing on these naughty parts!). 
   Things begin going into a downward spiral rather quickly when one of 
   the nurses is beheaded by a scythe held by the black-clad killer, 
   while nympho Anne strips naked in the greenhouse to have sex with the 
   gardener (John Ely). He has to slap Anne several times to get her to 
   leave because he doesn't want to lose his job (When the male 
   orderlies find Anne, she tries to force herself on them!). We also 
   find out that the married Cheryl may be having an affair with Dr. 
   Clay. The killer sneaks into Ruth's bedroom, strangles, then stabs 
   her with a medieval dagger, and cuts off her panties. The next to die 
   is Professor Osterman's chauffeur Augusto (Fernando Cerillo; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WatchMeKill1977">WATCH
    ME WHEN I KILL</A></B> - 1977), who is pushed into a spiked iron 
   maiden of Nuremberg in the Medieval Room, as his blood flows and 
   collects at the bottom (don't worry, we'll see his impaled body later 
   in the film). The killer then goes into Cheryl's room to murder her 
   with a sword, but she's not there (she's with Dr. Clay), so he goes 
   to Mara's room, but she is getting it on with dyke Nurse Helen 
   (Monica Striebel) in some naughty bubble bath action. The frustrated 
   killer then goes to Anne's room (where we just witnessed her doing an 
   explicit masturbation scene that would have automatically slapped 
   this film with an X-Rating if left intact), where he chops her 
   graphically with the small hand axe (but not before she tries to hit 
   on him!). After Nurse Helen and Mara dance to music from Mara's 
   African ancestry, they get down to some girl-on-girl action in bed 
   (another really explicit sexual scene which would have slapped the 
   film with an X-Rating). After they are done, Mara looks out her 
   window, only for a crossbow bolt to come flying through the window 
   and impale her in the neck (the bolt protrudes out of the other 
   side). Nurse Helen screams out in terror as Professor Osterman, Dr. 
   Clay, the gardener and the rest of the staff rush to see what is 
   going on. Professor Osterman recognizes the crossbow bolt as coming 
   from the Medieval Room, so he, Dr. Clay and Cheryl head there, where 
   they discover Augusto riddled with holes (including a large one in 
   the back of his head). <A HREF="slaughter_hotel_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/slaughter hotel blu-ray front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="233" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Osterman
    also notices blood on some of the other weapons and that one of the 
   swords is missing. So just exactly who is the killer? Is it Professor 
   Osterman? Or Dr. Clay (don't count him out because he disappeared for 
   a short amount of time when he was alone with Cheryl)? The gardener? 
   How about Cheryl? The police arrive and the Inspector (Ettore Geri) 
   wants to use Cheryl as bait for the killer's next strike. Will the 
   killer succeed or fail? What are his motivations? I'm not going to 
   say, but this one is pretty easy to figure out if you read the entire 
   review. Let me just go on to say that the killer briefly escapes 
   police custody, kills two cops and viciously murders eight to nine 
   female patients and nurses with a medieval mace as they are cowering 
   in a room (very brutal and unexpected), before being gunned down with 
   at least twenty shots by the police (shown in slow motion just before 
   the film ends).&nbsp; While not a great giallo film by anyone's 
   standard, it is still a quite weird one. Director/screenwriter <A HREF="fernando_di_leo_crime_collection_volume_1_cardboard_sleeve.htm">Fernando

    VS. KILLERS</A></B> - 1985), who passed away in 2003, makes some 
   mighty strange choices in this film, which is why it is so memorable. 
   For one, the nudity and sex goes way beyond what we here in the 
   States would find tolerable in 1973 in a non-porn film and that is 
   why almost all of it is missing in the R-Rated theatrical cut (The 
   VHS, from <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Gorgon">Gorgon Video</A>,
    was as close as you would get to seeing more nudity than you did in 
   theaters, but it was still heavily edited), as cinematographer Franco 
   Villa (<B><A HREF="malabimba_the_malicious_whore_1979.htm">MALABIMBA: 
   THE MALICIOUS WHORE</A></B> - 1979) does many close-ups of female 
   masturbation where they actually open up their labias and expose the 
   pink inside. That was a no-no, even in R-Rated films of the 70's. Di 
   Leo also had esoteric choices in music (by Silvano Spadaccino), as 
   part of the film sounds like muzak from an elevator and other times 
   it is a cacophony of percussions and other loud sounds, followed by 
   seconds of extreme silence and then loud sounds again (I first 
   thought that there was something wrong with the pressing of my 
   Blu-Ray, but learned quickly that it was intentional). Editor Amedeo 
   Giomini (<B><A HREF="#CrossCurrent">CROSS CURRENT</A></B> - 1971) 
   also spastically cuts the film in weird angles, as each woman seems 
   to be having strange nightmares about things that happened at the 
   clinic. If you pay close enough attention, you will spot the killer 
   way before the police do (Di Leo uses Kinski as a red herring to good 
   effect). If you like your films full of explicit sex, nudity and 
   graphic violence, you can do no better than this film, which bears 
   the original Italian title &quot;<B><I><A HREF="slaughter_hotel_1971c.htm">La

   (1972 - 1983) days to portray a psychopathic bisexual pedophile named 
   Fleck who kidnaps young children for ransom. He even disguises 
   himself as an old female fortune teller! When five children are found 
   brutally murdered, two New York cops (Fred Carpenter, Donnie Kehr) 
   are assigned to the case and discover that the killings may be tied 
   to a drug case they are also investigating. When another child is 
   kidnapped, one of the cops go undercover as the child&#146;s father 
   to deliver the ransom. Things go wrong (the stupid kid tells Fleck 
   that the cop is not his father) and Fleck escapes, killing another 
   cop in the process. Things come to a bloody end as we find out that 
   Fleck is using the ransom money to finance his fledgling drug empire. 
   Fleck disposes of anyone who gets in his way, slashing one of the 
   hero cops and blowing away his drug associates. Fleck meets a fitting 
   end, getting a knife thrown through his neck, pinning him to a wall. 
   Although the acting is uneven, this Long Island-lensed feature has 
   enough bloodshed (make-up effects by Bryant Holt) and tense 
   situations to hold your attention. Heads and hands are blown off in 
   graphic detail, there&#146;s a scene where a man has his head crushed 
   under the wheels of a moving vehicle and Burghoff&#146;s performance 
   (he directed all his own scenes) is excellent. He is chilling. He is 
   the total antithesis of Radar. The New York Post stated that 
   &#147;Burghoff&#146;s role makes Hannibal Lecter look like a Boy

   This film gets a lot of positive reviews, but I don't get it. They 
   also say it's a giallo film, but I don't see it. Since it has a 
   limited cast, the giallo element just isn't there. It is more like a 
   murder mystery where we know who dunnit. The mystery element is so 
   obvious, I guessed the finale fifteen minutes into the film, but it 
   does have a certain something that keeps your eyes on the screen.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We see&nbsp; the elderly Dorothy Emerson (Zora Gheorgieva) stumbling 
   around in her bedroom, her throat cut. The police declare it a 
   suicide (Who cuts their own neck???) since her bedroom door was 
   locked from the inside and there is no window in the room. They 
   couldn't be more wrong. Dorothy's young daughter from a previous 
   marriage, Nancy Thompson (Luciana Della Robbia; a.k.a. <A HREF="smile_before_death_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/smile before death danish vhs front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="285" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>&quot;Jenny

   mother's house, throwing the lives of her stepfather Marco (Silvano 
   Tranquilli; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Slasher1972">THE SLASHER...IS 
   THE SEX MANIAC!</A></B> - 1972) and his mistress, professional 
   photographer Gianna (Rosalba Neri; <B><A HREF="#SlaughterHotel1971">SLAUGHTER
    HOTEL</A></B> - 1971), into a state of turmoil. Gianna tells Nancy 
   that she was her mother's best friend (Dorothy was married several 
   times) and they become fast friends, but are they really? Gianna 
   calls Marco and tells him that Nancy may be of age to inherit her 
   mother's fortune. Marco is the executor of Dorothy's will and is also 
   the executor in charge of Nancy's inheritance until she reaches the 
   age of eighteen. Marco believes Nancy to be 13 or 14 years old, but 
   Gianna believes she is older (Why don't they ask her?). Nancy soon 
   becomes Gianna's photography model, because she has a face and body 
   that are very photogenic. She dresses Nancy in adult clothing and 
   wigs, applies makeup to her face and makes her look older. Is Gianna 
   really her friend or is she up to something more sinister?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Marco arrives home and sees a beautiful woman walking up a staircase 
   and into his bedroom. When he opens the door, he discovers a stark 
   naked Nancy. Marco smiles and closes the door. We soon find out that 
   Marco and Dorothy's marriage was on the rocks, but her death 
   &quot;remedied&quot; the situation. What situation? Marco treats 
   Nancy as a daughter, including her in a bunch of fun activities, but 
   when she goes sailing, she nearly drowns, Marco not lifting a finger 
   to help her. Is he trying to kill her? And what about those phone 
   calls to the house where no one is on the other end?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Housekeeper Magda (Dana Ghia; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightChild1975">THE
    NIGHT CHILD</A></B> - 1975) tells Nancy what she knows about her 
   mother's death and she doesn't believe it was a suicide. We witness a 
   flashback to the night Dorothy died. There was a huge party at the 
   house and when Marco enters a bedroom, he finds Dorothy in bed with 
   much younger man Paolo (Hiram Keller; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#SevenDeathsCatsEyes">SEVEN
    DEATHS IN THE CAT'S EYES</A></B> - 1973). This doesn't phase Marco 
   in the least because they have an &quot;open&quot; marriage, but when 
   he asks her for some financial help on a real estate deal, she 
   refuses, telling him that she is sick and tired of supporting a 
   &quot;Roman&quot; loser and she wants a divorce. Magda overheard the 
   entire conversation.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Back in the present, Marco becomes touchy-feely with Nancy, tickling 
   her while she is sunning topless. This upsets Gianna, but Nancy likes 
   it and may be falling in love with her stepfather (Gianna even takes 
   photos of Nancy posing topless with Marco. But why, if she is so 
   upset?). When Nancy tells Gianna that she loves her like the mother 
   she never had (Dorothy shipped her off to boarding school and she 
   never really knew her mother), Gianna begins to take nude photos of 
   her (Just like a real mother!). One night when Marco come home, he 
   finds Nancy all woozy and ready to pass out. She tells him that she 
   always feels this way at night because Gianna makes her take drops of 
   an unknown liquid before she goes to bed. Nancy asks Marco if he had 
   a happy marriage with her mother and his answer is honest, saying, 
   no, he never loved her. Nancy says she never loved her either because 
   &quot;she was a stranger to me.&quot; Marco and Nancy then make love 
   and the next morning he tells her that he doesn't regret it (She asks 
   Marco if Gianna is more of a woman than her and he tells her not to 
   be silly. Nancy shoots back, &quot;Excuse me, I'm young. I still 
   haven't learned to be a hypocrite!&quot;).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then witness another flashback to that fateful night, where 
   Dorothy asks Gianna if she is Marco's lover. She tells Dorothy that 
   she has been his mistress for a long time, even before she married 
   Marco. Dorothy throws a bottle of booze to the floor, breaking it. 
   She orders Gianna to clean it up, while telling her how wonderful it 
   is being Paolo's lover. Gianna then picks up a shard of glass and 
   thrusts it into Dorothy's neck, killing her. She uses a piece of 
   string to turn the key on the bedroom door, locking it from the 
   inside and making it look like a suicide. Marco is well aware on what 
   Gianna did&nbsp; and may have had a hand in making her do it.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Someone tries to kill Gianna by messing with a circuit breaker in 
   her darkroom, almost electrocuting her. Was it Marco? He takes Nancy 
   to the racetrack and sees her talking to a man, but can't make out 
   his face. When he asks her who she was talking to, Nancy replies, 
   &quot;Typical Latin lover. Passionate and jealous!&quot; Was she 
   talking about Marco or the mystery man? It becomes very obvious that 
   there is more to Nancy than meets the eye. She has been playing Marco 
   and Gianna against each other, but why? Marco does a back-trace on 
   the phone number of the hang-up caller and seems surprised on what 
   her finds (he keeps it secret from Gianna). Nancy tells Gianna that 
   her mother mailed a letter to her the day before she died which 
   revealed who wanted killed her. When Nancy is out of the house, Marco 
   and Gianna rifle through Nancy's room and find the letter. What is in 
   the letter leads up to both of them killing Magda. Marco stabs Magda 
   in the back and Gianna pummels her head in with a blunt object and 
   then they turn on each other. We then find out that Nancy is not 
   actually Nancy at all. She is actually Paolo's girlfriend. This was 
   all a blackmail scam to extort money from Marco. &quot;Nancy&quot; 
   played both sides off each other in order for Paolo to get a tape 
   recording of them<A HREF="smile_before_death_1972_italy_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/smile before death italy poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   admitting to Dorothy's murder (Paolo says to Marco about Dorothy's 
   murder, &quot;I don't like my dish taken away while I'm 
   eating!&quot;). Paolo tells Marco that he will take the tape to the 
   police unless he antes up with a hefty amount of money. Marco writes 
   them a large check, but when Paolo and &quot;Nancy&quot; (we never 
   find out her real name) take off on his motorcycle, laughing about 
   how they got away with it and are now rich, they don't see a car 
   heading towards them. The film ends with Paolo and fake Nancy dead on 
   the pavement, while the car's driver (an innocent) hears the tape of 
   Marco and Gianna admitting to murder. Everyone loses!</FONT></FONT><BR>

   accolades in giallo film circles, but I fail to see why. There are 
   far too few people to make this a serious giallo film and the mystery 
   element is not that complex. I guessed the reveal about fifteen 
   minutes into the film and most giallo diehards should also. For 90% 
   of the film, it is basically a three-character play, so the 
   appearance of Paolo at the end is kind of a cheat on the audience 
   since we are never clued in on&nbsp; Paolo's rage, besides the 
   flashback where Dorothy exclaims on how good a lover he is. 
   Otherwise, he is just someone in the background. If it weren't for 
   the frequent nudity on view (I consider Rosalba Neri to be one of the 
   most beautiful and talented women to appear in Italian genre films), 
   this film would have been a complete washout, at least for me. The 
   screenplay, by Amadio, Francesco Orazio Di Dio &amp; Francesco Villa, 
   taken from a story idea by Francesco Merli (Producer of the Italian 
   horror films <B><A HREF="terror_creatures_from_the_grave_1965_alpha_dvd.htm">TERROR-CREATURES
    FROM THE GRAVE</A></B> and <B><A HREF="bloody_pit_of_horror_1965.htm">BLOODY
    PIT OF HORROR</A></B> [both 1965]), takes forever to get on point, 
   the blood and violence is rather tame for a giallo film and it doesnt 
   come until the final 20 minutes. The surprise reveal is actually no 
   surprise at all, as attentive viewers should have guessed the outcome 
   long before it happens (never plan a killing with a killer). Another 
   major problem is that whomever dubbed Marco's voice did a terrible 
   job, as he speaks in monotone, making Silvano Tranquilli's 
   performance one-note. Oh well, not every Italian genre film can be a 
   winner. Worthwhile for the nudity and Bob Deramont's organ-heavy 
   earworm score. You'll be humming it long after the film is over.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   this film was never released legally on home video in the United

    SPIRAL OF MIST</A><A NAME="SpiralOfMist1977"></A> (1977) -</B> 
   Strange and very unusual thriller that contains just as much male 
   full-frontal nudity as it does female nudity, so if you can handle 
   rather long and lingering shots of non-erect willies swinging in the 
   breeze, you may find yourself enjoying the non-linear story. The film 
   opens with Fabrizio Sangermano (Marc Porel; <B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#SexCrime1983">KILLING
    OF THE FLESH</A></B> - 1983) shooting his wife Valeria (Carole

    decide if Valeria's death was accidental or done with malice. It 
   won't be easy to come up with a decision because everyone in this

   would rather not come out in the open. Get ready to go on a ride 
   that's confusing at first, but it becomes very interesting and 
   involving as the film progresses, not to mention it is dripping with 
   nudity and sex that goes way past what we here in the United States 
   would ever see in a normal movie house without going to a porn 
   theater. I'm not kidding. This film takes nudity and sex to a whole 
   other level, but none of it is titilating at all, as it only brings 
   out the worst in people.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Judge tries to get Fabrizio to recreate what happened in the 
   woods, but he soon learns that Fabrizio is not even trying to help. 
   Is he suffering because of his wife's death or is he just being 
   uncooperative? We then learn that Maria Teresa and Marcello's 
   marriage is anything but perfect (What marriage is?), as Marcello is 
   impotent when he treies to make love to her, not being able to 
   &quot;get it up&quot; (if you catch my drift). Yet he has no problem 
   having Maria Teresa watch him take a shower (full-frontal male 
   nudity), even inviting her to join him and wash his back, which she 
   does (she cries behind him so he can't see her). We later discover 
   that the maid, Armida (Anna Bonaiuto; <B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#HitSquad1976">HIT
    SQUAD</A></B> - 1976), is giving Marcello hand jobs frequently, so 
   could his impotence be nothing but a fraud? Later in the film, Armida 
   tells Maria Teresa that she is pregnant and Marcello is the father, 
   but Maria Teresa calls her a liar, thinking her husband is impotent 
   with all women, not just her, which is a lie. What's confusing at 
   first is the way the film goes from the present to the past, where we 
   see that Fabrizio and Valeria's marriage is also not in good shape, 
   but after a short time, it becomes acceptable and important to 
   discover if Fabrizio did intentially murder his wife or not. We 
   discover that Valeria likes to boss Fabrizio around, especially in 
   front of his friends. She even makes him get down on his knees, as 
   Valeria informs him that he got her pregnant again (they already have 
   a young son and daughter, portrayed by the director's children) and 
   he is never going to touch her again. Before that, we see Valeria and 
   Fabrizio in bed, Valeria giving her husband oral sex (this comes very 
   close to porn), but she stops before she finishes, saying she's 
   unhappy and her life is in &quot;desperate&quot; shape. She tells 
   Fabrizio that she may even kill him because she is so desperate.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In the present, we see Nurse Lavinia giving Fabrizio a hypodermic 
   shot in his ass, which leads to them making love. Lavinia is also the 
   girlfriend of Cesare, but she tells Fabrizio that Cesare's claim of 
   being married ten years ago, but refusing to get a divorce because he 
   is Catholic, is nothing but a lie. He uses that excuse so he doesn't 
   have to marry anyone else, especially Lavinia. She doesn't seem to be 
   too bothered by it, as we see her making love to Cesare a short time 
   later (Cesare mentions his sham marriage and Lavinia just smiles and 
   says nothing). When the Judge visits his Mother and tells her he is 
   going to get married (to Lidia), she doesn't even ask her son for the 
   woman's name, as she has been through a bitter marriage with the 
   Judge's Father (Enzo Fiermonte; <B><A HREF="my_dear_killer_1972.htm">MY
    DEAR KILLER</A></B> - 1972), who the Judge is still friendly with, 
   but he doesn't tell his mother that. Mom finally confesses that his 
   father didn't actually leave the family, she left him because she 
   couldn't stand him, so she's against the Judge's upcoming marriage 
   because it means he won't visit her as often as he does now. The 
   Judge finally brings Fabrizio into his office and questions him, but 
   it is obvious that Fabrizio is being difficult and uncooperative, so 
   the Judge sends him to prison until his trail. The film ends with 
   Fabrizio's uncle, Pietro Sangermano (Corrado Gaipa; <B><A HREF="no_way_out_1973.htm">TONY
    ARZENTA</A></B> - 1973) talking to the Judge and learning that 
   Fabrizio will remain in prison until his trial, but the Judge tells 
   Pietro that he doubts that Fabrizio will be convicted of voluntary 
   manslaughter, because there are too many loose ends to make him look 
   guilty; a jury would never convict him. We then get an&nbsp; overhead 
   shot of the Judge leaving Pietro's opulent mansion, getting into his 
   chauffeur-driven car and driving away, leaving the viewer still 
   uncertain about Fabrizio's predicament, but since the Judge is the 
   only person in the film without any secrets (at least not bad ones), 
   we have to trust his judgement and believe that Fabrizio will go free.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The ending to this Italy/Spain/France co-production should make the 
   viewer boiling mad, but director Eriprando Visconti (<B><A HREF="nun_of_monza_1969.htm">THE
    NUN OF MONZA</A></B> - 1969), working from a screenplay written by

    ORCA</A></B> - 1976) and Roselyne Sesboue (her only credit), has 
   created a film that makes you really think, so you are not 
   disappointed with the film's outcome. Quite thje contrary, as Marc 
   Porel, Dulio Del Prete and Roberto Posse and their female 
   counterparts all have full-frontal nude scenes, and by the end of the 
   film, you will no longer feel like a peeping tom because, in this 
   film, just like in real life, it's a normal everyday occurrence. What 
   woman never saw her husband or boyfriend naked? I wish more films

   sweepstakes!), but we live in a world where female nudity in films is 
   more acceptable than male nudity (except for porn flicks, especially 
   gay porn films). The sight of a penis may get your film to be rated 
   with the equivalent of an XXX Rating or NC-17, unless you edit it 
   out, but no one raises any concern when a vagina is shown. It's this 
   type of double standard that has to stop, but the old suits at movie 
   studios still carry around this stigma when it comes to showing a

   also be noted that Eriprando Visconti (who passed away in 1995 at the 
   age of 62) was the nephew of famous Italian film director Luchino 
   Visconti, who was also known for pushing the boundaries about what is 
   acceptable in his films, only he did it during the '50s, '60s &amp; early-'70s
    of Italian cinema (even earning himself an Academy Award&reg; 
   nomination) before passing away in 1976. I'd like to believe that 
   Eriprando was paying tribute to his uncle with this film, but even if 
   he wasn't, this film will certainly get your attention if you give it 
   a chance. The <A HREF="spiral_of_mist_1977.htm#OST">music soundtrack</A>,

   will remind you of the works of Ennio Morricone. It's not a film for

   called away on business. Julie takes a taxi home and they are stopped 
   at a roadblock by the police, who demand to see their papers. It 
   seems there was a murder nearby, committed by a straight 
   razor-wielding &quot;sex maniac&quot;, who is terrorizing Barcelona's 
   female population, raping them and then slicing their bodies with the 
   razor. When Julie hears this, she has a flashback showing her making 
   violent love to her former beau, Jean (Ivan Rassimov; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Spasmo">SPASMO</A></B> 
   - 1974), who is a real scumbag. Once home, Julie takes a shower 
   (yowza!) and hears a knock on her door. A deliveryman hands her a 
   bouquet of flowers, but there is no card to tell her who they are 
   from. Julie then goes to a party (and we see the female party goers 
   get into a playful topless wrestling match!), where she meets 
   Australian diplomat George Corro (George Hilton; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#KillerMustKillAgain">THE
    KILLER MUST KILL AGAIN</A></B> - 1973) and she sees Jean in the 
   crowd, so she leaves. Outside, Jean grabs Julie and offers her a ride 
   home, but she wants nothing to do with him, telling him that their 
   love affair is over.&nbsp; Neil pulls up in his car and sees Jean put 
   hands on his wife, so he punches him in the face. All Jean does is 
   laugh like some madman. Julie tells Neil to leave Jean alone because 
   he is a &quot;pervert maniac&quot;, but why does she still have 
   violent sexual dreams about him?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see a young woman come home from a date, strip naked and 
   take a shower (double yowza!). The sex maniac enters her apartment 
   and slashes her to death in the shower, her naked body collapsing 
   into the bathtub. Julie and best friend Carol (Cristina Airoldi; <B><A HREF="#HumanFactor1975">THE
    &quot;HUMAN&quot; FACTOR</A></B> - 1975) are driving down the 
   street, where Julie tells her she married Neil only to get rid of 
   Jean, who refuses to take no for an answer, telling Carol, &quot;A 
   wall is no use against Jean.&quot; They meet George at his apartment, 
   where it is highly apparent that he wants to get into Julie's 
   panties, but she is not interested because he is so abrupt and 
   forward. All three of them go out for dinner, where George carves his 
   initials in an apple and hands it to Julie, which she eats in front 
   of him (George says, &quot;Do you want to eat me Julie?&quot;). Carol 
   gets a call and has to leave, so after dinner is over, George gives 
   Julie a ride home...on his motorcycle, but instead of driving her 
   home, they take a long romantic ride in the country. Julie tells 
   George she has changed her mind about him, he's actually a nice guy. 
   But is he really? Julie and George become lovers and as they are 
   walking hand-in-hand down a suburban street at night, Jean drives by 
   and nearly hits Julie, scaring her half to death. But was it really Jean?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While George and Julie are making love on a couch in his home, the 
   killer watches them through a window, getting turned-on by all the 
   naked thrusting. The next morning, Julie gets a bouquet of flowers 
   delivered to her at George's house and once again the sender is 
   anonymous. She then gets a phone call from the killer, who tells her 
   a place and time to meet him, but Julie thinks it is Jean disguising 
   his voice and tells him to get lost. The caller tells her she better 
   show up. Julie tells Carol about George and the phone call and Carol 
   and she tells Julie to go for it with George and she will take 
   Julie's place with the caller, meeting at the time and place he 
   mentioned. Thinking just like Julie that the caller is Jean, Carol 
   wants to get the satisfaction of telling him to fuck off. Big 
   mistake. Julie goes to the appointed place, a park maze made out of 
   tall hedges (it's quite the sight), and walks around, the further she 
   gets into the maze, the darker it gets. She spots the park caretaker, 
   who tells her that the park is about to be closed and locked up for 
   the night and, a short time later, Carol is viciously slashed to 
   death, the caretaker finding her bloody body and calling the police. 
   Julie tells the Police Commissioner (Carlo Alighiero; </FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="thriller.htm#CatONineTails1971">THE

   into his office, where he and Julie face-off.&nbsp; The Commissioner 
   tells Julie that Jean couldn't have possibly killed Carol because he 
   has an airtight alibi and Jean goes as far to accuse Julie of being 
   the killer, telling the Commissioner that she has a &quot;blood fetish&quot;.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    George promises Julie that he will protect her, but he doesn't do 
   such a good job, because when he drops Julie off at her apartment 
   complex, she is nearly slashed to death by the killer in an 
   underground parking lot. She escapes in an elevator by the skin of 
   her teeth, falling into Neil's arms at their apartment front door. 
   Neil, thinking that Jean is the killer, drives to his house with 
   Julie to confront him, but they find the front door open, the 
   electricity out and no one seemingly home. Using a cigarette lighter 
   to illuminate their way, they search Jean's home, finding one of the 
   rooms to be a zoo of live winged creatures (among them are a hawk and 
   a bat). They then find Jean slashed to death in his own bathtub. 
   Julie still has violent sexual dreams of Jean, only this time he is 
   bloody and naked, slapping the shit out of her. If Jean is not the 
   killer, who is?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Neil gets a photo of the killer, taken by a security camera in the 
   underground parking lot, but it is dark and blurry, yet Julie points 
   to him as the man who tried to kill her. We finally get a good look 
   at the killer's face (portrayed by Bruno Corazzari; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#KillerWoreGloves74">THE
    KILLER WORE GLOVES</A></B> - 1974) when he attacks a young woman in

   killing him. Does that mean that Julie is finally safe? Don't count

   but, like most good giallo films, it doesn't surprise you with a 
   &quot;left field&quot; denouement, where someone we never saw before 
   is the real killer. This story makes perfect sense. When it is 
   revealed that Julie actually has a blood fetish (blood turns her on, 
   especially blood and violence mixed together), you'll be wondering if 
   Julie is the killer. Is she? I'll never tell, but I have given you

   opens with a van (with only one working headlight) pulling in front 
   of the camera, it's single headlight blinding the viewer for a good 
   sixty seconds before we cut to a shot of a dead girl with her bloody 
   arm dangling out of a trash bin and the title of the movie spelled 
   out in red letters on the inside of the bin. We then watch a hooker 
   getting dressed in sparkly spandex and walking the streets looking 
   for a customer. She finds the unseen killer in the van (after walking 
   under a ladder!),<A HREF="streets_of_death_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/streets of death vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="176" HEIGHT="319" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   who tempts her with lots of money and the next time we see her, the 
   killer is dumping her lifeless bloody body in a dumpster. After 
   getting slapped around by her pimp for not making enough money, 
   another hooker gets picked up by the van killer and her hanged and 
   naked body is discovered by a wino in an abandoned building the next 
   morning. Police Lieutenant Bernie Navarre (Simon DeSoto) and 
   Detective Grant Jordan (Lawrence Scott) have found five bodies in the 
   past three weeks and they are stumped, so when they see someone 
   beating up a hooker on a street corner, they give chase, only to have 
   the shit kicked out of them by the hooker's lesbian girlfriend, who 
   is an expert martial artist (but not the killer). Another hooker 
   exits a car (She says to her john, &quot;It was a pleasure sitting on 
   your face!&quot;) and gets picked up by the van killer. Before you 
   know it, she is hog-tied and naked with the killer slowly advancing 
   at her body with an electric drill. By the time Bernie and Grant view 
   her corpse, she has had so many holes drilled in her, there's not an 
   ounce of blood left in her body. Undercover officer Kelly Anderson 
   (Susanne Smith) is assigned to work as a hooker to catch the killer, 
   with Grant as her backup, but, at first, all she is able to attract 
   is a car full of horny Chicanos and a dirty old man (who she picks up 
   in front of a store called House of Bibles!) who is naked under his 
   raincoat. Bernie is forced by the higher-ups to allow two filmmakers, 
   Artie Benson (Larry Thomas, who later gained fame as the &quot;Soup 
   Nazi&quot; on <B><A HREF="seinfeld_tv_series.htm">SEINFELD</A></B> 
   [1990 - 1998]) and Lenny Miller (Guy Ecker), to make a documentary on 
   prostitutes in the city, not knowing that Artie and Lenny are 
   actually the (homosexual) van killers and they now have a license to 
   film their murders. They almost get caught while dumping a body, but 
   Artie and Lenny kill the two eyewitnesses. Kelly and Grant eventually 
   fall in love, but will she live long enough for them to find true 
   love? Ex-cop Frank Phillips (a bloated and top-billed Tommy Kirk), 
   who was kicked-off the force for being drunk when he killed a kid 
   brandishing a toy knife, suddenly enters Bernie's office and begs him 
   to let him work on the hooker murder case as a civilian (What?). 
   Meanwhile, we learn that Artie and Lenny are making snuff films for 
   profit and they need to film more hooker deaths to satisfy the demand 
   for their product. Only Frank seems to know what they are up to, but 
   can he convince his ex-boss before more hookers lose their lives? 
   Does anyone really care? Hey, is that lump on my head a brain 
   tumor?&nbsp; Films (and I use that term loosely) don't come much 
   worse than this; from Tommy Kirk's sweaty, whiney performance (I'd 
   like to say this film killed his gin-soaked career, but he did that 
   long before appearing in this, starring in such Larry Buchanan's 
   turdfests like <B><A HREF="mars_needs_women_1967.htm">MARS NEEDS WOMEN</A></B> 
   [1967] and <B><A HREF="its_alive_1969.htm">IT'S ALIVE</A></B> [1969]) 
   to Jeff Hathcock's turgid video direction and deadly dull screenplay. 
   There's way too much talk and very little bloody action considering 
   the subject matter (the camera always turns away just as things are 
   about to get interesting) and the romance between Kelly and Grant 
   takes up more screen time than it deserves. While there is a little 
   blood and nudity shown, the flat video photography does it no favors 
   (It's muddy as dishwater, like watching a film through a lace doily 
   smeared in Vaseline) and the droning synthesizer score will give you 
   a migraine long before the movie ends. This is the least-seen of 
   Hathcock's 80's flicks, but there's a reason for that. It's about as 
   exciting as watching your Aunt Doris trimming her toenails. Also 
   starring Dave Kalmeyer, Kahlena Marie, Gil Revilla, Lonny Withers,

   Carlo Bianchi (Nino Castelnuovo) take the woman's body to her house,

   gay, the killer could be a man or a woman). A police inspector (Lucio 
   Como) interrogates all of the agency's employees and tries to tie-in 
   the doctor's murder with Mario's, since they are so similar. Gisella 
   and Lucia begin a lesbian relationship and Gisella warns Lucia to 
   stay away from Carlo if she knows what's good for her. Lucia is then 
   graphically stabbed to death by the leather-clad killer immediately 
   after Gisella leaves the apartment. An earring found next to Lucia's 
   body offers an important clue to the killer's identity and when 
   Maurizio is the next to suffer the fate of the killer's knife, all 
   clues point to Gisella being the killer. But when Gisella is 
   blackmailed for ten million lire by someone over the phone and Carlo 
   takes photos of the killer murdering Gisella as she is delivering the 
   blackmail money (she is stabbed and has both her ears cut off), it is 
   apparent that Carlos is the blackmailer and the killer is someone 
   close to him. The killer tries to run over Carlos with a car, sending 
   him to the hospital. Magda must find Carlos' undelveloped roll of 
   film to unmask the killer. When Magda is set-up to look like the 
   killer, Carlo must unmask the real killer in the film's bloody 
   climax. If you have been following this review closely, you should be 
   able to figure out who the killer is.&nbsp; This is a nasty, 
   nudity-filled thriller that is sure to raise some eyebrows, due to 
   both male and female full-frontal nudity and the manner of the 
   killings. Director Andrea Bianchi, who also gave us the excellent

   that the overweight Maurizio could never fit into the killer's tight 
   leather outfit), but even those not familiar with giallo conventions 
   could unmask the killer more quickly than this film's police 
   inspector. The stabbings are quite nasty (plenty of spurting blood) 
   and the sight of the male victims' removed testicles (yes, you do see 
   them on a couple of occasions!) is quite unnerving. This may not be a 
   top-tier giallo film, but it has enough quirkiness (such as the 
   reveal that Maurizio is a virgin and can only make love to a blow-up

   that he was her father, but she can't remember his name. The 
   Inspector ask the doctor if any &quot;love Juice&quot; (semen) is on 
   or in the young woman's body and he says no, it doesn't look like a 
   sex crime, but the work of a maniac, since there are multiple bruises 
   on her breasts and abdomen. The Inspector tells District Attorney 
   Listri (Aldo Massasso; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Contraband1980">CONTRABAND</A></B> 
   - 1980) that they will have to depend on the forensic evidence to 
   identify the young woman and her killer, taking the D.A. to a coffee 
   shop while they wait for the Forensics Department to call them 
   (Marisa's identity card is a phony and her fingerprints are not on 
   record, which tells the Inspector that she was not a criminal). Also 
   at the coffee shop is Paolo, who overhears them talking about the 
   case. Is Paolo involved in all this somehow or is it just dumb luck? 
   As the Inspector is leaving the coffee shop, a young thief on a 
   scooter steals his expensive gold lighter as he is lighting a

    We then see Paolo, who is carrying a gun, sneak into the apartment 
   of the landlady. He wraps a phone cord around the landlady's neck and 
   demands to know what she told the Inspector. She tells him that she 
   said nothing and then mentions a man named &quot;Menga&quot; and how 
   he wasn't satisfied with the usual whores. He wanted more, so he 
   started trafficking minors, but she didn't want any part of that 
   &quot;rotten business.&quot; She asks Paolo who he is and he tells 
   her that he's her executioner if she doesn't tell him where Menga 
   lives. Suddenly, her doorbell rings and it's the police, Paolo 
   telling her to get rid of them and no tricks. The Inspector wants to 
   see the murder scene again, so the landlady takes him there and Paolo 
   then leaves her apartment, catching a thief (the same thief that 
   stole the Inspector's gold lighter) trying to lift a portable radio 
   from the front seat of his car. Instead of getting mad, Paolo makes 
   the thief a deal. He offers to cut him in for 50% of a much bigger 
   haul if he'll work for the &quot;MYOFB&quot;. The young thief asks 
   who they are and Paolo responds, &quot;Mind Your Own Fucking 
   Business.&quot; The thief agrees and they introduce themselves to 
   each other. The thief's name is Giannino (Adolfo Caruso) and Paolo 
   give him his real name, also telling him, &quot;They call me 
   Milingi.&quot; Paolo hops on Giannino's scooter and they go on a 
   miniature crimewave, stealing the purses and jewelry of prostitutes 
   as they pass them on the scooter. When they try to steal an obese 
   prostitute's purse, her pimps appear and Paolo shows Giannino what a 
   good fighter he is, beating up the pimps. What is Paolo's game?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Giannino introduces Paolo to his mother and young brother, telling 
   Paolo that he supports his family by stealing. Paolo and Giannino go 
   through all the purses they stole, Paolo telling him that he can keep 
   all the cash, all he wants are the prostitute's notebooks. Paolo and 
   Giannino become fast friends and partners in crime (although it is 
   strictly minor), but the question still remains: Why does Paolo want 
   to find Menga? The notebooks lead them to a business called &quot;The 
   Syndicate Of Milanese Women Domestics&quot;, a front for an underage 
   prostitution racket. Paolo tells Giannino to get lost when he asks 
   him why he is so interested in Menga (He tells Giannino, &quot;Didn't 
   you agree to MYOFB?&quot;), so Giannino leaves while Paolo enters the 
   business and questions the man at the front desk, asking to speak 
   with the director. The female director of the business introduces 
   herself to Paolo and they dance around about hiring a 
   &quot;domestic&quot; because she doesn't know if Paolo is a real 
   customer or the police. When he gains her trust, she tells him that 
   the only domestics they have are &quot;students&quot; and that they 
   are very expensive. Two men then appear at the front desk and tell 
   Paolo that this is a professional business and if he doesn't leave 
   they will call the police. Paolo leaves and then one man turns to the 
   other and says, &quot;Call Raimondo.&quot; Where did we hear that

    Paolo then picks up prostitute Carmela (Lia Tanzi; <B><A HREF="action.htm#ViolentProfession73">THE
    VIOLENT PROFESSIONALS</A></B> - 1973) at her normal place on the 
   street and she takes him back to her apartment, where he tries to 
   impress her by paying her with fifty American dollars (She throws the 
   money back at him, saying, &quot;Dollars are not what they once use 
   to be!&quot;). Paolo pretends to be the limousine driver for a 
   wealthy Arab sheik to further impress her in hopes that she will tell 
   him where Menga lives. He tells her that his boss likes his women 
   young and that she is too old for him. Carmela doesn't care and asks 
   Paolo to introduce her to the rich Arab (she says, &quot;For 500,000 
   lire, I'll find him a toddler!&quot;). Paolo tells her that her will 
   give her a telephone number and if the Arab doesn't answer, to ask 
   for Paolo or Giannino. He then asks Carmela to give him his 
   fifty-dollar's worth and when he rolls over on her bed, he breaks his 
   eyeglasses even more (a running joke throughout the film). We then 
   have to ask ourselves: Who is Paolo really? Why is he so desperate to 
   find Menga?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Milan is also going through a kidnap spree of young children, the 
   latest victim is the son of a rich chocolate candy magnate. The 
   kidnappers are demanding two million lire for the safe return of his 
   son.&nbsp; Is it possible that Menga is involved in these 
   kidnappings? Carmela sends an underage hooker to the ritzy Parca 
   Hotel, thinking she is sending her to rich Arab Prince Yousef, but 
   the young hooker meets Paolo instead. He asks her who her pimp is but 
   she is too scared to answer and leaves the room. At this point in 
   time, we learn that Paolo is actually Police Detective Paolo Germi 
   and he has Giannino (who still doesn't know that Paolo is a cop) 
   follow the underage hooker, who has hopped in a taxi, hoping she will 
   lead them to Menga. Giannino then follows he into a subway and leads 
   Giannino and Paolo to her pimp. The pimp shoots and kills the young 
   girl, thinking she has set him up. Giannino gets knocked-out in the 
   ensuing skuffle and Paolo shoots and kills the pimp. Paolo tells 
   Giannino to get lost and he searches the pimp's apartment, finding 
   out that the pimp's first name is Milingi (Where did we hear that 
   name before?). How is the rest of the film played out? There will be 
   more dead bodies, as Paolo and Inspector Teti do their own separate 
   investigations (The Inspector doesn't know Paolo is a cop) and both 
   come to the same conclusion about Menga. Is he the real head of the 
   underage hooker ring?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While there are the prerequisite bloody violence and nudity we 
   demand from a Poliziotteschi flick, director/co-screenwriter Sergio

   - 1979) also tosses something uncommon into this genre: a healthy 
   dose of humor. Throughout the film, Paolo's eyeglasses take a beating 
   and he drives what has to be the worst car in action film history. 
   When he first meets Carmela on the street, she has to enter the car 
   by climbing onto the roof and enter through the sunroof, as none of 
   the doors or windows are able to open. Just like his eyeglasses, his 
   car takes a beating as the film progresses, losing the two passenger 
   side doors and, eventually, the hood in a car chase that could be 
   best described as <A HREF="suspicious_death_of_a_minor_1975.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/suspicious death of a minor italy poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>comically
    insane. It is Claudio Cassinelli who makes this film so special, as 
   he takes all the lumps he gets in stride, never losing his sense of 
   humor in even the most dire of circumstances. But he is not the only 
   one who is humorous. Gianfranco Barra as Inspector Teti is also a 
   delight, always trying to find a system to win the soccer lottery and 
   always failing, yet he never gives up. Mel Ferrer (<B><A HREF="#PyjamaGirlCase">THE
    PYJAMA GIRL CASE</A></B> - 1977) puts in an extended cameo as the 
   Police Superintendent, both Paolo and Teti's boss, but he may be more 
   involved in the case then the two of them are aware of.&nbsp; But 
   this is far and away Claudio Cassinelli's film, as he is superb in 
   both his comedic and dramatic roles, sometimes at the same time. 
   While I generally frown upon comedy mixed with action, Martino, 
   working with a script written by himself and his longtime 
   collaborator Ernesto Gastaldi (he has written or co-written the 
   screenplays to Martino's <B><A HREF="#YourViceLockedRoom">YOUR VICE

   because the comedy is not kitchen-sink style, it seems natural to the 
   characters. The relationship between Giannino and Paolo could have 
   been played broadly, but both Cassinelli and Adolfo Caruso play it 
   realistically, giving their characters a true emotional core. The 
   fact is, we care about them. As I mentioned earlier in this review, 
   Martino adds some giallo elements into the film, as we always see the 
   killer's POV, as murders people in his way. The killer also wears 
   black leather gloves and the violence is bloody, which elevates this 
   film a notch or two above most Poliziotteschi films. Very seldom has 
   Sergio Martino failed me as a director and this film is no different. 
   It has an involving story, marvelous performances and will elicit 
   smiles. What more could you ask for?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   even though he has an above-average IQ, has trouble relating to women 
   on a personal level. He has a girlfriend (Boti Ann Bliss) who does 
   anything to please his sexual desires, but he still feels the need to 
   mutilate and sexually assault (including necrophelia) young women to 
   satisfy his homicidal deviant ways. He leaves a trail of bodies from 
   Seattle to Salt Lake City to Colorado Springs and, finally, to 
   Florida. Picked up for questioning in a botched kidnapping in Salt 
   Lake City, Bundy is interrogated by a detective (played by Tom 
   Savini, who also supplies the gruesome special make-up effects) and 
   is subsequently charged in the murder of a woman in Colorado. Bundy 
   escapes from jail, not once, but twice, and hightails it to Florida 
   where he takes a new identity but doesn't change his murderous ways. 
   He kills and mutilates several more women before being caught after 
   killing a 12 year old girl and sentenced to die in the electric chair 
   (which he did in 1989). This is a sensationalistic retelling of 
   Bundy's story; much different than the 1986 TV movie <B><A HREF="deliberate_stranger_1986.htm">THE
    DELIBERATE STRANGER</A></B>, where police procedural played an 
   important role and Mark Harmon played Bundy. Here, the entire story 
   is played through Bundy's eyes, from his first murder to his 
   well-deserved demise. I hate to say it, since I like Matthew Bright's 
   previous directorial efforts, but this is not a very good film. The 
   main distraction is Burke's performance as <A HREF="ted_bundy_poster.htm">Bundy</A>.

   Portraying America's worst sociopath with a wink towards the humorous

   clothing as we do not feel the gut-punch that we should when watching 
   this character killing innocent women. Stephen Johnson, who co-wrote 
   this film with Bright, did a much better job with the screenplay to <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Ed Gein">ED

   elements lifted from <B><A HREF="last_house_on_the_left2.htm">LAST 
   HOUSE ON THE LEFT</A></B> (1972) and revel in sexual degradation. The 
   story is very simple: We are introduced to a variety of very 
   unlikable characters as they board a train in Rome bound for Germany, 
   while three gentlemen with no morals whatsoever, led by David (Werner 
   Pochath; <B><A HREF="action.htm#CopGame1988">COP GAME</A></B> - 1988; 
   here billed as &quot;Paul Werner&quot;), begin to terrorize them, 
   using the victims' fears and deep-rooted secrets to their advantage. 
   David and his two friends, Elio (Carlo De Mejo; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Contamination1980">CONTAMINATION</A></B> 
   - 1980) and Nico (Giancarlo Maestri), start their mischief in the 
   train's dining car, being loud and obnoxious, playing their portable 
   radio too loud and being asked to turn it down by a rich, elderly 
   businessman and his assistant (who we see buying his boss a stack of 
   porno magazines before they board the train). The only member in the 
   dining car who seems to like them is rebellious teenager Elena 
   (Fiammetta Flamini), who is one the train with her strict, but 
   abhorrent, parents. When Italian cop Mike (Venantino Venantini) <A HREF="regazza_del_vagone_letto_1979.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/terror express dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="221" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>brings
    his handcuffed prisoner, Pierre (Gianluigi Chirizzi; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BurialGround1980">BURIAL

   escorting Pierre to Germany to stand trial for some, as yet, unknown 
   crime), it causes more of a moral stink with the passengers than 
   David and his friends do (They have already humiliated the busboy), 
   so Mike and Pierre are forced to go back to their compartment and eat 
   dinner alone. Also on the train is high-priced callgirl Julia (Silvia 
   Dionisio; <B><A HREF="andy_warhols_dracula_1973.htm">ANDY WARHOL'S DRACULA</A></B> 
   - 1973), who has a session with the elderly rich businessman in her 
   compartment, but there are quite a few other men on the train that 
   would like to spend some time with her, including Elena's father, who 
   wants Julia to wear Elena's nightgown while he makes love to her 
   (it's a sick, pseudo-incestual sequence). The married, but unhappy, 
   Anna (Zora Kerova; <B><A HREF="cannibal_ferox_1981.htm">CANNIBAL FEROX</A></B> 
   - 1980) willingly has sex with Elio in one of the train's bathrooms, 
   but soon Nico enters the bathroom to make Anna the meat in their rape 
   sandwich. Before long, David knocks out Mike, steals his gun and he 
   and his two friends take over the train car. Elio frees Pierre from 
   his handcuffs, while David locks both exit doors to the railway car 
   and disables the handbrake so they can torture and torment the 
   passengers at their whim. David wants Julia to give up her goodies to 
   him willingly, but she refuses, so he threatens to rape Elena 
   instead. Elena's mother pleads with Julia to fuck David and his 
   friends, so she relents and screws David and Elio. Elio also makes 
   love to a willing Elena (another sexually graphic scene), Pierre and 
   Julia form a friendship and everyone else bickers amongst themselves 
   while the train approaches its first stop. David and his pals lock 
   all the passengers in one compartment as the train makes its first 
   regularly scheduled stop, but Pierre escapes out a window. Will he 
   escape or will he return to save Julia and the other passengers 
   before David and his friends go full-tilt Bozo?&nbsp; A lot of review 
   sites give <B><A HREF="terror_express_1979b.htm">TERROR EXPRESS</A></B> 
   high marks, but, to me, it's nothing but a film about a group of very 
   unlikable people (I'm not just talking about David and his two pals, 
   but also about nearly all of the passengers) being asinine pricks and 
   getting the punishment they deserve. It's no coincidence that

   Montefiori, better known on these shores as &quot;George Eastman&quot;
    of <B><A HREF="grim_reaper_1980.htm">THE GRIM REAPER</A></B> [1980] 
   fame) make prostitute Julia and prisoner Pierre the most sympathetic 
   characters in the film, because all the other &quot;normal&quot; 
   people (including the train's conductor [played by Gino Milli], who 
   is nothing but a pimp in a uniform) are some of the most useless 
   trash this side of a John Waters film (except for elderly couple Mary 
   [who is dying] and husband Isaac, who never leave their compartment). 
   Baldi wallows in the sleazier aspects of the film, including plenty 
   of nudity, sex (especially an over-reliance on oral sex), rape and 
   humiliation, which I guess is enough for some people, but not me. 
   Werner Pochath is no David Hess and his antics as the leader of the 
   trio (I guess naming him &quot;David&quot; was some sort of homage) 
   pales in comparison to <B>LAST HOUSE</B>'s Krug and company. The 
   actual physical violence is rather restrained and bloodless (there 
   are plenty of sexual assaults, though) until the finale, but by that 
   time I had lost all interest. Not worth your time unless you like 
   watching deserving people being degraded. Also starring Fausto

   I have fond memories of watching this film on TV (under the title <B>INN
    OF THE FRIGHTENED PEOPLE</B>) during the 70's with my late mother. 
   It was a favorite of hers, thanks to the psychological, rather than 
   physical, violence as well the surprise ending and would soon become 
   a favorite of mine, too (for the same reasons). The TV showings 
   dried-up during the mid-80's and, besides a short-lived <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Miscellaneous">AIR
    Video</A> VHS release (using the title <B><A HREF="behind_the_cellar_door_1971.htm">BEHIND
    THE CELLAR DOOR</A></B>), it disappeared from view. Imagine my 
   surprise finding this tight little thriller on DVD. The story is 
   simple: Jim and Carol Radford (James Booth, Joan Collins) lose one of 
   their daughters (it's actually Carol's step-daughter) when she is 
   raped and killed by a pedophile when leaving school. The police 
   arrest a suspect named Seely (Kenneth Griffith), but have to release 
   him when all the evidence in the case against him turns out to be 
   circumstantial. A distraught Jim enlists the help of his teenage son 
   Lee (Tom Marshall) and family friend Harry (Ray Barrett) to kidnap 
   Seely and bring him to the Radford's cellar, which sits below a 
   crowded pub that the Radford's own and run. After slugging Seely a 
   few times (even Carol gets in a few licks), they tie him up and must 
   decide what to do with him. As they try to keep their prisoner a 
   secret from their other daughter <A HREF="terror_from_under_the_house_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/terror from under the house poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="154" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Jill
    (Zuleika Robson), Lee's fiancee Rose (Sinead Cusack), who works as a 
   waitress at the pub, and the pub's patrons, the Radfords and Harry 
   begin fighting among each other (especially about who is actually 
   going to kill him) and have many close calls with their new prisoner, 
   including a couple of nosy beer deliverymen and an escape by Seely. 
   When information comes to light that Seely may actually be innocent, 
   it puts the Radfords into an even deeper quandary: Should they let 
   him go and hope for the best or should they kill him to cover up 
   their mistake? After all, haven't they all suffered enough? When 
   Seely returns to the Radford's home on his own after the escape, that 
   seems to resolve their problem, but the surprise ending (which I 
   won't reveal here) is a doozy and fits in perfectly with the rest of 
   this tension-filled film. It's a shocker.&nbsp; This is an excellent 
   little British thriller (originally filmed under the simple 
   descriptive title <B><A HREF="revenge_1971.htm">REVENGE</A></B>) that 
   should be seen by those that like their films suspenseful and 
   well-plotted. Unrelenting in tone, this film ponders the age-old 
   questions: How far would you be willing to go to achieve justice, 
   when all legal avenues have failed you? How far do you have to cross 
   that invisible line in the sand before it's too late to turn back? 
   Could you murder someone to satisfy that sense of justice? This film 
   will make anyone think twice about committing vigilante justice, 
   especially when they witness how it tears at the fabric of a 
   tight-knit family. The acting here is top-notch, especially by both 
   James Booth (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#AvengingForce">AVENGING FORCE</A></B> 
   - 1986) and Joan Collins (those who know Collins only by her <B><A HREF="dynasty_tv_series.htm">DYNASTY</A></B> 
   role, 80's TV movies and soap opera appearances are in for a 
   surprise). They play decent, upstanding citizens who let their grief 
   of losing their daughter get the best of them and their actions and 
   guilt over what they do next will, unfortunately, do more damage to 
   their lives and the lives of their remaining family members than the 
   rape and murder of their daughter ever will. The look on Carol's face 
   as she listens through the wall as her stepson Lee and Rose fight 
   (Lee is unable to sexually perform due to his guilt of kidnapping 
   Seely) says a lot, but when Lee rips off Carol's blouse and rapes her 
   in front of Seely (after she tries to console him over what she has 
   just heard), you know things are going to go downhill very quickly. 
   Director Sidney Hayers, who also gave us the rape-themed <B><A HREF="in_the_devils_garden_1971.htm">IN

   underrated thriller <B><A HREF="deadly_strangers_1974.htm">DEADLY STRANGERS</A></B> 
   (1974), keeps things moving briskly and the script (by John Kruse) is 
   expertly paced and not condescending. There is a smattering of blood, 
   but the film is not about violence, it's about the breakdown of a 
   family due to violence. Carol's rape is only seen through Seely's 
   shattered eyeglasses, wonderfully projecting the disintegration of 
   the Radford family. Required viewing for thriller fans. Also known as <B><A HREF="after_jenny_died_1971.htm">AFTER

   dark room, building a large cathedral (the last thing he saw before 
   falling out of the tree) with Legos (!), as a small puppy whines by 
   his feet. The being picks up a tire iron, knocks the puppy's head off 
   (!), smiles and then continues building his cathedral (I wasn't sure 
   what kind of animal it was until I viewed the sequence frame by frame 
   and there it was, a puppy!). What does one sequence have to do with

   pissing away Lilly's inheritance in the process. Lilly has invited 
   some friends over for the weekend, including model Olga (Anna Maria 
   Chiante) and photographer Paul (Timothy Wood). Paul is a control 
   freak, as we watch him taking nude photos of Olga, complaining that 
   she is not following his instructions, as he snaps away with his 
   camera in a field close to the villa. Olga grows tired of Paul's 
   constant complaining, tells him to &quot;fuck off&quot; and walks 
   back to the villa, buck-naked. She becomes aware of a presence 
   following her and she begins walking faster, but she never makes it 
   to the villa. We then see the Being rolling around in sheep shit, 
   making love to Olga's bloody corpse! He is then attacked by one of 
   the sheepdogs, but he snaps its neck and pulls its jaws apart, 
   killing it (dogs don't like him). He then carries Olga's corpse to 
   God knows where (maybe in the dark room with the Lego cathedral?).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    NUDE FOR YOUR KILLER</A></B> - 1975) and his pretty 
   &quot;secretary&quot; Helen (Gina Mancinelli). This is going to be a 
   very interesting and deadly weekend, folks! At the afternoon barbecue 
   (Where the fat Bitto is the cook, because all he does is talk about 
   food), Lilly notices that Olga and Paul are nowhere to be found. We 
   then discover that the Being (who walks with a limp, probably caused 
   from falling out of the tree when he was a child) has a faceless 
   friend, who hands him a couple of boxes of Legos in his dark room. 
   That night, Paul pulls up to the villa in his Jeep, telling the group 
   he has no idea where Olga is, as she left his photo shoot in the 
   afternoon and he drove to town to take pictures of the buildings, so 
   they form a search party, breaking up into teams of two and go 
   looking for Olga in the middle of the night.&nbsp; Lilly are Andrew 
   are one team and they once again get into a fight over money, Paul 
   leaving her alone in the middle of the forest (Divorce sure sounds 
   like a good idea!). Lilly gets scared and starts running, calling 
   Paul's name, but he doesn't answer. She runs into the arms of Carlo 
   and they go back to the villa, the Being watching them as they walk 
   away. Andrew makes it back to the villa on his own, but only Paul is 
   there. He hits up Paul for $500, telling him he needs the money to 
   bet on an important poker game tomorrow and it is a sure thing. Paul 
   tells Andrew he is crazy if he thinks he is going to lend him any 
   more money, as Andrew still owes him $2,500 for his last &quot;sure 
   thing&quot;. Andrew tells him he has three &quot;suckers&quot; lined 
   up for this game and there is no way he is going to lose, also 
   telling Paul that he feels lucky and will pay him back after the 
   game. Paul then agrees to loan him the money, but he only has 48 
   hours to pay him back everything that he owes him. If he doesn't, 
   Paul's &quot;bosses&quot; will come and break Andrew's legs (Divorce 
   is really sounding good at this moment, as he doesn't even worry 
   about Lilly).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When everyone gets together back at the villa, finding that no one 
   has found Olga, they come to the conclusion that Olga hitchhiked back 
   to the city (I hope my friends would know better!), so they call it a 
   night. Silvia, who is not satisfied with that explanation (Finally, a 
   level-headed person!), leaves Carlo alone in their bedroom and goes 
   looking for Olga on her own (I take back that &quot;level-headed&quot;
    remark!). Lilly has something to tell Carlo, but he tells her he's 
   too busy (he's about to go looking for Silvia), so she turns around 
   and walks away, saying she will tell him later (I hope she tells him 
   she's getting a divorce!). Silvia is scared when she notices some 
   shrubbery moving in an unnatural way, like someone invisible is 
   walking through it, so she backs away slowly, only to discover that 
   the Being is behind her. A short time later, Carlo and Paul find 
   Silvia unconscious in the woods and carry her back to the villa. When 
   she wakes up, she tells everyone that a madman attacked her. Helen 
   wants to leave immediately, but Lilly tells her to calm down, it was 
   probably thieves and &quot;they're probably more scared than us.&quot;
    Bitto agrees, but Helen says there's a killer out there, so they 
   compromise and call the police instead. Only the phone is dead (and 
   it's a good twenty years before cell phones become commonplace). 
   Bitto goes to drive Helen to safety, only his car and all the others 
   have been disabled or tampered with. Andrew grabs a shotgun and 
   everyone, except for Silvia, who they leave sleeping in bed 
   (What?!?), leave the villa and try to find a way to safety. They find 
   a working car, so Bitto and Helen get in it and drive away, promising 
   to contact the police, only they don't very far, as the Being kills 
   them both when Bitto gets out of the car to unlock the gate that 
   leads to the villa.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Lilly and Andrew get into another fight about money, only this time, 
   instead of leaving, Andrew rapes Lilly! She at first fights him, but 
   soon eases up, telling him when he is finished to leave the room 
   (Lady, D-I-V-O-R-C-E!!!). After that statement, Andrew is unable to 
   finish and walks out of the room, Lilly calling him an 
   &quot;imbecile&quot;. Paul then enters Carlo and Silvia's bedroom and 
   when Carlo leaves, Paul shows Silvia photos of her having lesbian sex 
   with Olga (no wonder she was so determined to find her!). Yes, Paul 
   is blackmailing Silvia, threatening to show Carlo the photos if she 
   doesn't pay up. This group, except for one or two people, are the 
   dregs of society, worthless human beings that deserve to be killed 
   and our lazy-eyed Being is more than happy to oblige. He sneaks into 
   the villa and begins killing everyone one by one, beginning with Paul 
   and then Carlo, both of them being butchered with a meat cleaver. 
   Silvia discovers their bodies and runs to Lilly. How many people will 
   survive this onslaught and what will be left of them? The film 
   concludes with the following quotation, just as a certain someone is 
   about to kill Lilly with the meat cleaver: <B>&quot;God will be the

    I want to call this a giallo film, but it really isn't in the 
   strictest sense, because we know who the killer is and we can easily 
   guess why he is killing these worthless people (They remind him of 
   his bossy childhood friend, as they are just like him, the scum of 
   the Earth. Or is someone telling him to kill these people, because 
   there is an agenda?). About the only thing we don't really know is 
   who is the faceless person that brings him the boxes of Legos? Is he 
   the childhood friend who now is an adult? That is kind of a cheat, as 
   by the end of the film, it can only be one person, the one we hate 
   the most (it's not very hard to discover, even in this review, but I 
   refuse to give it away). Director Gianni Martucci (screenwriter of <B><A HREF="#NakedGirlPark1972">NAKED

    NERVE</A><A NAME="TwistedNerve1968"></A> (1968) -</B> Fantastic 
   British psychological thriller about personality disorders and 
   chromosomal damage. The first time we meet Martin Durnley (Hywel 
   Bennett; <B><A HREF="percy_1971.htm">PERCY</A></B> - 1971), he's 
   visiting his dying brother Peter at a hospital, where the attending 
   physician tells Martin that his brother is deteriorating fast (What 
   he is dying of is not made clear, but attentive viewers should be 
   able to pick up a couple of clues). The next time we see Martin, he 
   is shoplifting a toy duck from a store. He gets caught by the store's 
   security guards, who mistakenly think he is working in concert with 
   innocent librarian Susan Harper (Haley Mills; <B><A HREF="endless_night_1972.htm">ENDLESS
    NIGHT</A></B> - 1972; also with Bennett) and they are both brought 
   to the manager's office. Martin pretends to be a retarded boy named 
   &quot;Georgie&quot; and the manager decides to let them both go out 
   of pity. Martin takes an instant shine to Susan and keeps up the 
   Georgie personality when in her presence. We then learn that Martin 
   comes from a well-to-do, but highly disfunctional family. His mother 
   (Phyllis Calvert) is quite overbearing (but, as we find out later, 
   she has good reason for being so watchful of Martin) and his 
   stepfather (Frank Finlay; <B><A HREF="creepers_1971.htm">THE CREEPERS</A></B> 
   - 1971) wants Martin out of the house for good. Martin begins an 
   incredible <A HREF="twisted_nerve_1968.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/twisted nerve poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="189" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>ruse
    where he becomes Georgie full-time and insinuates himself into 
   Susan's life. He takes a room in Susan's mother, Joan's (Billie 
   Whitelaw; <B><A HREF="omen_1976.htm">THE OMEN</A></B> - 1976), 
   boarding house and manipulates everyone there into thinking that he 
   is &quot;special&quot;. His obsession with Susan grows greater as the 
   days wear on (He intentionally calls Joan &quot;Mummy&quot; to keep 
   her off-balance), but slowly, his alter ego's identity begins to 
   crack and expose itself. One night, Martin returns to his real home 
   and kills his stepfather with a pair of scissors, which makes the 
   police highly suspicious of Martin. Martin also manages to get rid of 
   everyone else that gets in his way of obsessing of Susan, usually by 
   non-violent ways. He chases away Joan's lover Jerry (Barry Foster; 
   Hitchcock's <B><A HREF="frenzy_1972.htm">FRENZY</A></B> - 1972) and 
   Phillip (Christian Roberts: <B><A HREF="mind_of_mr_soames_1970.htm">THE
    MIND OF MR. SOAMES</A></B> - 1970), a would-be boyfriend of Susan's. 
   Susan finally catches on to Martin's act when he tries to kiss her 
   (and this is not the kiss of a retarded child). She begins unraveling 
   his ruse after finding evidence in his room of his true identity. 
   This leads to a finale where we discover Martin's true defect 
   (chromosome damage) and how Georgie eventually becomes the permanent 
   dominant personality.&nbsp; This is a crackling good thriller, 
   directed and co-written by British veteran Roy Boulting (<B><A HREF="undercovers_hero_1974.htm">UNDERCOVERS
    HERO</A></B> - 1974; <B><A HREF="last_word_1980.htm">THE LAST WORD</A></B> 
   - 1980). that rewards the patient viewer (not that there are too many 
   of them left in this world of instant gratification). The deliberate 
   pacing may seem slow to modern-day audiences, but there's hardly a 
   wasted moment, as we watch the clearly mentally-damaged, but very 
   intelligent, Martin create a new identity and how he works out 
   everything down to the smallest detail, fooling his parents into 
   thinking he is vacationing in Paris when, in reality, he's only a few 
   miles away in a boarding house pretending to be a child trapped in an 
   adult's body. The script, by Boulting and Leo Marks, offers the 
   viewers many insights into Martin's psychological make-up and is full 
   of symbolic images that gives us a peek into his mind. My two 
   favorite scenes are deft visuals that show us how Martin feels about 
   himself and Susan. The first is when Martin is in his bedroom at his 
   parents' house and he strips naked after looking at some male 
   bodybuilding magazines. We hear a crash and the camera pans to Martin 
   looking at himself in a full-length mirror. The mirror is smashed at 
   a section where it obliterates the view of his genital area. It's a 
   telling scene in so many ways. The second scene is much more simple, 
   but no less telling. Martin spies on Susan in the boarding house with 
   a hole he has drilled in the wall. The hole is in the shape of a 
   heart. What do you suppose that represents? Hywel Bennett is 
   absolutely chilling as Martin/George. The whole film hinges on 
   whether he can pull-off the complex dual identities and make them 
   believable and I'm glad to report that he does so magnificently. 
   Former Disney star Haley Mills is also terrific, as is Billie 
   Whitelaw as her sexually-active mother. The whole premise of 
   mongolism and chromosomal damage (as a matter of fact, the word 
   &quot;mongolism&quot; is considered offensive in today's society. The 
   politically correct term is &quot;Down Syndrome&quot;) may seem dated 
   today, but back when this film was made (way before DNA testing and 
   shows like <B><A HREF="csi_tv.htm">CSI:</A></B> were even a glimmer 
   in anyone's eyes), this was a daring subject. So daring, in fact, 
   that the producers were forced to tack on a prologue after the film 
   was finished stating that there was no connection between mongolism 
   and psychopathic behavior. There's a lot in <B><A HREF="twisted_nerve_1968b.htm">TWISTED

    EMI</A> label on VHS on U.S. home video, but those with multi-region 
   DVD players may be able to find the British DVD like I did), grab it 
   and never let it go. Though not bloody or sexually explicit, this is 
   a mature film and the haunting tune that Martin whistles on several 
   occasions (music by Hitchcock regular Bernard Herrmann) may seem 
   familiar to true cinema lover's ears, because you can hear Daryl 
   Hannah whistling it in <B><A HREF="kill_bill_1&amp;2.htm">KILL BILL:

    TERROR</A><A NAME="UdergroundTerror"></A> (1988) -</B> Strange New 
   York City-lensed low-budget thriller about a cop, Detective John 
   Willis (Doc Dougherty), who just lost his partner in a drug bust gone 
   wrong, trying to stop a recently released mental patient named Boris 
   Pinscher (Lennie Loftin; <B><A HREF="from_dusk_till_dawn_3_2000.htm">FROM
    DUSK TILL DAWN 3: THE HANGMAN'S DAUGHTER</A></B> - 2000), who is 
   committing a series of brutal murders in the city's vast series of 
   underground tunnels of the subway system. Boris declares that the 
   underground is &quot;My World&quot; and gathers up a gang of 
   society's rejects as his followers, who obey his every command 
   (including cutting off the ears of the victims, which Boris fashions 
   into a necklace). Detective Willis has attitude problems of his own, 
   as early in the film we watch him take the law into his own hands, 
   killing two drug pushers in the same building his partner was 
   murdered in (not to mention that he has been involved in eight 
   shootings in the past 21 months). The short-fused Willis is also 
   being dogged by female newspaper reporter Kim Knowles (B.J. Geordan), 
   who seems to take pleasure in chronicling Willis' unlawful efforts 
   for her paper. Willis and Kim form an uneasy alliance when she writes 
   a story on a gang of killers <A HREF="underground_terror_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/underground terror vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="155" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>in
    the subway system that she bought from bum Pops (Herb Farnham) for 
   $20 and Willis notices that the story bears striking similarities to 
   the case he is working on (Boris gets his revenge on Pops by tying 
   him to the rails and letting a subway car run over him). Willis is 
   suspended from the force when he kills a member of Boris' gang (who 
   was mugging a young woman on a deserted subway platform he was 
   staking out) and can't convince his boss that there's an organized 
   gang of psychos killing people underground. Kim goes underground to 
   retrieve her camera (which she stupidly left in Boris' killing room 
   on a previous expedition with Willis) and is captured by Boris. 
   Willis grabs a shotgun and heads below ground, but he seems more 
   interested in blowing everyone away than saving Kim. A wounded Boris 
   picks death over being sent back to the loony bin, so he grabs hold 
   of the third rail, electrocuting himself. Willis callously turns to 
   Kim and says, &quot;There's your story&quot; as he walks away without 
   her.&nbsp; This is a dank, dingy little slice of sleaze that benefits 
   greatly by being filmed in the most dirty, colorless locations New 
   York City has to offer (although all the subway sequences seem to be 
   filmed on sets). Believe me when I say that the NYC Tourism Board 
   will never endorse <B>UNDERGROUND TERROR</B>. Director James 
   McCalmont (co-director of <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#EscapeFromSafehaven">ESCAPE

   like <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Rejuvenator">THE REJUVENATOR</A></B> 
   [1988]), working with a screenplay by Brian O'Hara and Robert 
   Zimmerman, fills the screen with very unlikable people; even Willis 
   and Kim are hard to root for, because they both have their own 
   agendas for solving these crimes. Willis is just a nasty, shoot-first 
   kind of guy (he does go to church to confess his sins after killing 
   the two drug dealers, but changes his mind in mid-confession, as if 
   to say &quot;This is too much fucking trouble!&quot;) who sees 
   solving these crimes only as a way of being reinstated to the force 
   and Kim just sees a story that will put her on the front page of her 
   newspaper. Neither one of them gives a shit about the victims. Boris 
   is just a complete psycho (He doesn't have much of a back-story, 
   although it's apparent he's familiar with the underground and 
   probably lived there before he was committed to the mental hospital, 
   but it is never revealed why he was committed. His predilection for 
   human ears is the closest we get to a reason.), who views the 
   underground as his own personal kingdom and kills anyone (including 
   members of his own gang) that he perceives to be an enemy. There's 
   one scene where Boris bludgeons a woman over the head with a table 
   leg after he has just raped her, rather than share her with one of 
   his underlings. This scene shows his total disregard for human life 
   and lack of respect for his fellow gang members. He acts as if the 
   world revolves around him. While the violence in the film is somewhat 
   gory (stabbings, shootings, ears and fingers being sliced off), it's 
   the film's hopeless tone, which is greatly enhanced by the minimalist 
   electronic score (by TAJ), which makes this a worthwhile viewing 
   experience. If I had to compare this to any other film, it would be 
   Joseph Zito's <B><A HREF="#Bloodrage">BLOODRAGE: NEVER PICK UP A STRANGER</A></B> 
   (1980), because the gritty, realistic characters and low-budget 
   ambience (which is a character unto itself) propels this thriller

   feel-good film (if you suffer from depression, believe me, this film 
   is not for you), but a very interesting one. Also starring James

    [1973] Jason Miller) watches helplessly as his mentor is thrown out 
   a window and killed. Shortly thereafter, he has the opportunity to 
   escape when the prisoner's arm he is chained to gets caught under the 
   wheel of a truck and a guard chops the prisoner's hand off with a 
   machete. Aristides escapes and makes a run for it, but is later 
   caught by a sadistic guard and his even more sadistic guard dog, 
   King. When a helicopter overhead distracts the guard for a moment, 
   Aristides grabs his rifle and kills him, but before he dies the guard 
   tells King to hunt down and kill Aristides. The rest of the film is a 
   series of cat-and-mouse (or dog-and-man) chases, as the relentless 
   King pursues Aristides, who is a mathematician that has a formulation 
   in his head that translates into a list of names of undercover 
   government sympathizers that he must deliver to the Resistance 
   Movement. Aristides meets many people on his travels, including some 
   vagabonds, a lonely married woman and others, but time and time again 
   the dog shows up to put the hurt on Aristides, but on several 
   occasions Aristides gives as good as he gets (even one time biting 
   the dog on it's neck!). Aristides finally makes contact with the 
   Resistance, but when he witnesses some of their brutal tactics, he 
   begins to wonder which side is worse. When he finds out that his 
   lover, Muriel (Lea Massari), is a government informant, things begin 
   to unravel for Aristides. After he makes love to Muriel, the dog 
   smells Aristides' scent on her and follows her to Aristides' hideout. 
   The finale finds Aristides fighting for his life from both ends of 
   the political coin and a waiting plane is his only means of permanent 
   escape. As he runs for the plane with the dog just a few short steps 
   behind him, a sniper looks through his scope at both Aristides and 
   the dog. Who is he going to shoot?&nbsp; This political allegory 
   disguised as a thriller is very minimal in it's approach, but 
   effective. Director/co-scripter Antonio Isasi<A HREF="vengeance_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/dog 1976 aka vengeance german vhs front small2.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="132" HEIGHT="176" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> (<B><A HREF="action.htm#SummertimeKiller">THE
    SUMMERTIME KILLER</A></B> - 1972) portrays the dog as the Franco 
   regime, endlessly hounding Aristides, who represents the common 
   citizen looking for a better, less oppressive, life. Jason Miller 
   doesn't have much dialogue and I believe that was done purposely. It 
   makes the scenes between him and the dog all the more visceral and 
   animalistic. The attack scenes are realistic as Aristides must use 
   anything handy to fight off the beast, who attacks at the most 
   inopportune times (he at one point attacks Aristides while he is 
   taking a bath, naked in a river, proving that the dog picks his 
   battles well). Aristides hits the dog with the butt of a rifle, an 
   oar, his fists and even with a shotgun blast, but the dog always 
   resurfaces to make his life difficult. As the film progresses, 
   Aristides' life keeps falling deeper into a pit of despair, his 
   ideals becoming corrupted after finding out that his long-time lover 
   is an informant and has become the mistress of a high-ranking 
   government official and the realization that the revolution he is 
   fighting for may be more corrupt than the government itself. He 
   becomes so paranoid that he shoots a little girl's dog on a city 
   street when he mistakenly thinks it's King. Those expecting a horror 
   film (as it is advertised on VideoAsia's DVD sleeve) are going to be

    His bedroom is full of cages and aquariums of every type of small 
   animal. When his overprotective mother, Ruth (Cornelia Sharp), has to 
   leave on a week-long business trip, she leaves Phillip in the care of 
   the maid (Susan George) and Phillip's grandfather (Sterling Hayden, 
   in his last film), a big game hunter who is recuperating from a 
   stomach operation. With his grandfather's help, Phillip takes a taxi 
   to the pet store to pick up his newest acquisition: A harmless garden

   with a twist, as Dave, Jacmel, Phillip and his grandfather are 
   trapped in the house, with the police (headed by Nicol Williamson) on 
   the outside and the Black Mamba slithering around inside. It's a 
   tense standoff with a few surprising twists.&nbsp; Let me make this 
   clear: This is not a horror film. Sure, it's got horrific moments 
   (the snake attacks), but this is mainly a thriller with crime 
   elements first and foremost. Piers Haggard (<B><A HREF="blood_on_satans_claw_1971.htm">BLOOD
    ON SATAN'S CLAW</A></B> - 1971), who replaced Tobe Hooper (he was 
   fired ten days into shooting), builds the suspense slowly until it 
   comes to a boiling point. The fact that three of the most difficult 
   (some would say crazy) actors in the business, Klaus Kinski, Oliver 
   Reed and Sterling Hayden (sadly, all are dead now), not only star in 
   this, they play most of their scenes together, making this facinating 
   viewing for everyone. Some may find this a little slow moving, but 
   stick with it as you will be rewarded later on. The use of real Black 
   Mambas in the film greatly enhances the tension and terror. Rumor has 
   it that some of the cast members were actually bitten and had to be

   (1977/1982) -</B> I've been dying to get my hands on a copy of this 
   film since reading about it a couple of years ago in author Stephen 
   Thrower's excellent (and quite heavy) tome,<B> NIGHTMARE USA</B>. I

    know, I know. So sue me!) and I'm glad to report that it is as good 
   as Thrower makes it out to be. This is a deeply disturbing look into 
   the mind of rapist and strangler Paul Johnson (Tony Vorno - <B><A HREF="help_wanted_female_1968.htm">HELP
    WANTED: FEMALE</A></B> - 1968; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Garden Dead">GARDEN

    BABYSITTER</A></B> - 1978), who relates his life's story to 
   psychiatrist Dr. J.A. Russo (Jerome Guardino), with the help of 
   hypnosis therapy. When Paul is not harassing an adult bookstore owner 
   (&quot;Why do you sell such filth?&quot;) or porno theater patrons 
   (Paul tells one patron that cigarette companies put salt peter in 
   their smokes when he lights up in the theater), he drives around in 
   his red Ford Mustang looking for women to strangle and rape. The film 
   is nothing but a series of frequent fractured flashbacks (taken from 
   Paul's equally fragmented mind while under hypnosis) that shows the 
   audience why he does the dastardly deeds. When he was a child, his 
   mother, Paula (Lois Adams), was a high-priced hooker (who is 
   apparently dying of tuberculosis since she coughs a lot) who let her 
   pimp, Charlie (Bud Greene), physically and emotionally abuse Paul 
   while she would get dressed to meet her johns. Mom also steadfastly 
   forbade Paul to answer the phone (she didn't want her johns to know 
   she had a kid), so Paul would have to listen to the phone ring and 
   ring for hours on end. A ringing telephone becomes Paul's deadly 
   trigger; every time he hears one ring, he has to talk to himself to 
   stop from &quot;freaking out&quot;, only he is not successful all of 
   the time. Paul also has never known the love of a &quot;normal&quot; 
   woman (further flashbacks reveal that he was sexually abused as a 
   child by elderly hooker Sheila [Brandy Carson], who would baby-sit 
   Paul when Mom was away on &quot;business&quot;); the only sex he has 
   had are with a series of prostitutes who still manage to abuse Paul 
   financially because he likes rough sex. Every time Paul tries to talk 
   to a normal woman, it either ends in disaster (he tries to pick-up 
   one woman at a bus stop, but she pulls out a rape whistle and 
   threatens to blow it if Paul gets on the bus) or murder (he rapes and 
   kills a suburban housewife who has a room for rent). As Dr. Russo 
   uses hypnotism on Paul to delve deeper into his cracked psyche, we 
   discover even more reasons why Paul does the nasty things he does. 
   These questions remains: Will Dr. Russo's secretary, Marian (Lenore 
   Stevens), survive Paul's advances when Dr. Russo is out of the 
   office? Will Dr. Russo use hypnotism to get the ultimate revenge on 
   Paul? Directed/produced/written by star Tony Vorno using his real

   the filmmakers' minds, but I do know that this is one of the worst 
   films to grace my eyes in quite a while (and that's saying a lot!). A 
   traveling psycho named David Shepard (Eric Brown) is killing 
   prostitutes from town to town by bringing then to his hotel room and 
   strangling them in front of his video camera. A determined detective 
   named Delvecchio (John Fertitta) is always one step behind David. 
   Then, one day, David makes the mistake of picking up a rich girl 
   (Virginia Loridans) and bringing her to his hotel room. He botches 
   his attempt of strangling her and she escapes, only having enough 
   time to call Delvecchio and give her location before David recaptures 
   her. The police set up road blocks, forcing David and the girl to 
   hide out in an abandoned house. Delvecchio closes in and David flees 
   the house (leaving the girl unharmed). He steals a car and leads the 
   entire police force on a high-speed (and comically speeded-up) chase. 
   David is cornered on a bridge and blows his brains out (not seen), 
   while a TV reporter videotapes the event from a helicopter. It's hard 
   to find something good to say about this film. It's poorly acted, 
   highly disjointed, badly filmed and about as much fun to watch as 
   seeing your grandmother do a striptease. Only one of David's 
   strangulations is shown (it's bloodless), the rest have taken place 
   before the film started. Star Eric Brown can also be seen in the sex

   uppercrust family to its core; Gladys' brother, Lawrence (Quinto 
   Parmeggiani); maid Evelyn (Orchidea de Santis); valet Arthur (Claudio 
   Undari); and butler Peter (Ballard Berkeley). Barbara informs Gladys 
   that in the days before her brother's death, he locked himself in the 
   mansion's observatory and wrote a new will while he was in there. 
   While everyone wonders what is in the new will, Gladys tells Georgie 
   to take a bath (When he says he would rather take a shower, Gladys 
   responds, &quot;Only animals and Americans wash while standing up, 
   but a gentleman takes a bath!&quot;), so Georgie decides to teach her 
   a lesson by faking his suicide in the bathtub, complete with fake 
   blood, an appliance on his neck that looks like he slit his own 
   throat and a strait razor on the bathroom floor. Gladys is so 
   embarrassed by the spectacle (especially since everyone else saw it), 
   she nearly drowns Georgie in the bathtub (Georgie also affixes a fake 
   knife to a napping Lawrence's chest to make it look like he was 
   murdered!). At the reading of the will, the family lawyer informs 
   everyone that the entire fortune will go to niece Barbara and 
   everyone else gets nothing (Sgt. Thorpe does get 200 pots of Azaleas 
   because he helped the deceased man garden every Saturday afternoon). 
   As you can probably guess, the family goes ballistic and things turn 
   nasty and deadly very quickly. The first to die is Peter (Lawrence 
   says, &quot;At least, for once, nobody will say the butler did 
   it!&quot;), who is found with a knife in his back while sprawled out 
   in Sgt. Thorpe's potted Azalea plants. Scotland Yard is called in and 
   Inspector Grey arrives on the scene, just in time to witness someone 
   with a silencer take a shot at Barbara and miss. Ted is next to be 
   found dead, an apparent suicide with a gunshot to his head. It will 
   take Sgt. Thorpe, of all people, to solve the crimes, but there are 
   so many red herrings and whose body is buried in the sandtrap? You'll 
   have to watch the film to find out, but before the film is over, 
   there will be three more murders.&nbsp; This comedic murder mystery, 
   directed by Michele Lupo (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#MeanFrank1973">MEAN

    SHERIFF AND THE SATELLITE KID</A></B> - 1979), takes a little while 
   to get moving, but once it does, it is an enjoyably goofy take on a 
   rich family's fall from grace and how they resort to murder, lying 
   and cheating to try and restore the family's honor. The screenplay, 
   by Fabio Pittorru, Massimo Felisatti and Sergio Donati, is full of 
   quotable lines (Donati is credited with writing the dialogue) and 
   making the buck-toothed Sgt. Thorpe the butt of everyone's jokes 
   when, in fact, his looks belie the fact that he's the most observant 
   and astute person in the entire group. Time and time again he makes 
   Inspector Grey look like a buffoon, but he does it in such a way that 
   Grey never notices it and he even goes as far as to let the Inspector 
   take credit for finding the solutions to the various crimes. In fact, 
   Sgt. Thorne views the murders through a <B><A HREF="csi_tv.htm">CSI</A></B> 
   investigator's eyes, long before there was a CSI. The violence is 
   rather subdued, but the story touches on such usually forbidden 
   subjects as incest and rape and still somehow makes them seem 
   amusing. This film may not be to everyone's tastes (diehard giallo 
   fans will particularly dislike it), but I found it to be funny, as 
   well as an engrossing murder mystery. Originally released on VHS by <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#MGM/UA">MGM/UA

   Four friends just out of the Army take their ill-gotten wad of cash 
   and weapons arsenal and head for California. After beating a used car 
   salesman (Beach Dickerson) at his own game, they take their 
   newly-purchased Cadillac and hit the road. They pick up a woman 
   (Jennifer Billingsley) whose car has broken down at the side of the 
   road and take turns having sex with her in the back seat (she's a 
   willing participant). When they cross the state line and head towards 
   Oklahoma City, they offer her $100 for a bus ticket. She demands $500 
   or she'll tell the cops she was kidnapped. A struggle ensues and she 
   falls out of the speeding car. They stop and look at her lifeless 
   body lying at the side of the road and Danny (Joe Don Baker) says, 
   &quot;What do you think?&quot; Shooter (Paul Koslo) replies without

    in the best light. The first stop on their trip is Danny's hometown, 
   a small midwestern farming town called Foley. As soon as he steps 
   into town, Danny disappoints his father (Lonny Chapman) by telling 
   him that he is part owner of some farmland in California, owned by 
   third man Kid (Alan Vint) and, along with Kid, Shooter and Fatback 
   (Elliott Street), plan on making their lives there as farmers. After 
   leaving Foley, they drive a while and go to a motel, screw some 
   hookers and tell them their dreams. Danny's hooker (Francine York) 
   says to him, &quot;What have you done? You become what you've 
   done.&quot; Danny looks at her and sadly says, &quot;Kill.&quot; They 
   travel some more and their car breaks down in some podunk town, where 
   the sheriff (Billy Green Bush) lets them sleep in his jail while 
   their car is being repaired by a shifty mechanic. The mechanic rips 
   them off and the sheriff turns nasty and makes them pay. Kid loses 
   their money stash (the sheriff may have taken it and they can't go 
   back without being arrested), so they must rough it for the next 1800 
   miles. Things turn to shit in a town (ironically) called Hope, when 
   they get caught stealing gasoline.The owner of the station fires his 
   shotgun at them, so they use the arsenal of weapons in the trunk and 
   destroy the town like it was a 'Nam village, killing over 80 people. 
   They make their final stand in Hope and end up fighting the same Army 
   they were discharged from. The dream is over.&nbsp; This 
   slice-of-life drama, directed by Richard Compton (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Maniac! 1976">MANIAC!</A></B> 
   - 1977) and written by Guerdon Trueblood (<B><A HREF="candy_snatchers_1973.htm">THE
    CANDY SNATCHERS</A></B> - 1973), is an interesting character study 
   of four guys who did their time for Uncle Sam and just want a piece 
   of the American Dream. The closer they get to that dream, the more 
   they become disillusioned, resulting in them reverting back to their 
   soldier personnaes and destroying Hope (both the town and their 
   reason for living) in a shocking and surprisingly quick collage of 
   explosions, gunshots and death. The film builds slowly to this 
   carnage, but the threat of violence permeates every frame. Joe Don 
   Baker's Danny is definitely the alpha male of the group and the other 
   three follow his every move, even though Danny has a hair-trigger 
   personality that results in all of them losing their lives. Compton's 
   next film, <B><A HREF="macon_county_line_1974.htm">MACON COUNTY LINE</A></B> 
   (1974), follows the same story elements as this (and contains some of

   shocking violence in the finale. <B>SOLDIER BOYS</B> has never been 
   released on video in the U.S. (Twentieth Century Fox owns the 
   rights). The print I viewed was ripped from a Japanese VHS, which 
   fogs some brief female backside nudity during the motel scenes. The 
   air of hopelessness during the Vietnam War, both at home and abroad, 
   makes this the type of film that could have only come from the 
   nihilistic 70's. Also starring Geoffrey Lewis (as a more than

    The arrival of Daniela's sister Elena (Dagmar Lassander; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HouseByCemetery1981">THE
    HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY</A></B> - 1981) and her new husband Fabian 
   (Vito Domenighini) stirs something deep inside Daniela. She has a 
   deep-seated hatred for her sister and Fabian looks just like the man 
   whose face she cleaved in half in her nightmares. She daydreams that 
   she is naked and making love to Fabian, but she has more pressing 
   problems. She thinks she hears her ancestor calling to her, saying, 
   &quot;You belong to us!&quot; (and a large lizard crawls up her body, 
   resting between her breasts!). Is all this in her head?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That night, while peeping through the bedroom door, Daniela spies on 
   Elena making love to Fabian, masturbating while moaning. Fabian hears 
   her and gets up to investigate, walking outside (it is a full moon), 
   where Daniela his waiting for him, nude for all the world to see. 
   They begin to make love, but something stirs within Daniela, causing 
   her to kill Fabian by biting him on the neck and tossing his dead 
   body down a ravine. Daniela thinks she is a wolf woman, but is she? 
   The next time we see Daniela, she has been committed to a mental 
   asylum in a catatonic state. Her psychiatrist tells another doctor 
   that if she has another attack, rather than pumping her full of 
   drugs, they should restrain her. Elena comes to visit her sister and 
   Daniela tells her that she saw her making love to Fabian and then 
   yells out, &quot;You whore! Go fuck yourself, you dirty bitch!&quot;, 
   forcing the orderlies to tie her to the bed. This doesn't sit too 
   well with Daniela and that night a female nymphomaniac patient sneaks 
   into her room, unties Daniela and starts kissing her naked body (!) 
   Daniela kills her with a knife she had hidden under her body (where 
   did she get it?) and escapes the institution by hiding in the 
   backseat of a car driven by a female doctor (Felicita Fanny; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BigBustOut">THE
    BIG BUST-OUT</A></B> - 1972). The doctor sees her and crashes the 
   car. The doctor is in serious condition, but alive, and Daniela 
   escapes, walking down the road. She spots a peasant girl making love 
   to a man in a barn, getting turned-on in the process. In case you 
   haven't guessed by now, sex equals death to Daniela, so when the man 
   leaves, Daniela kills the young woman by biting her neck and breasts.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The police are called in when the bodies start piling up and 
   Inspector Modica (Frederick Stafford; Hitchcock's <B><A HREF="topaz_1969.htm">TOPAZ</A></B> 
   - 1969) and his partner Arrighi (Andrea Scotti; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#KillerReserved9Seat">THE
    KILLER RESERVED NINE SEATS</A></B> - 1974) go to see the Count when 
   they notice the wounds on the peasant girl bear a striking 
   resemblance to the wounds on Fabian's body. The Count tells them that 
   Daniela is very sick and that he has no idea where she is. Elena 
   overhears the conversation and now realizes that her sister killed 
   Fabian (she originally thought he was killed by a pack of wild dogs). 
   Meanwhile, Daniela hitches a ride with a dirty old man that can't 
   keep his hand off her thigh. The next time we see her (We are made to 
   think she killed the old man. This version is missing the scene of 
   the old man trying to rape her in his bed. She grabs his head and 
   bashes it over and over on the headboard, killing him.), she is 
   living in the house of a young man named Luca Mondini (Howard Ross; <B><A HREF="#FiveDolls1970">5
    DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON</A></B> - 1970), who picks her up on the 
   side of the road in the pouring rain. He is a movie stuntman and 
   treats Daniela like all women want to be treated: Like a human being. 
   They fall in love and a month passes without any incidents (There is 
   a scene where she shoots Luca with a pistol and he falls off a 
   building, but it is revealed that it is just a stunt he is performing 
   for a movie!). She calls her worried father and tells him not to <A HREF="legend_of_the_wolf_woman_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/legend of the wolf woman poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="191" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>worry,

   in the future?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Daniela can't seem to catch a break as, while Luca is at work, a 
   trio of rapists break into the house and sexually assault her. When 
   Luca comes home, the rapists are waiting for him. A fight ensues and 
   Luca is killed when one of the rapists stabs him in the stomach with 
   a switchblade (it's the way he stabs him which makes this scene stand 
   out). Daniela then goes on a murder spree, killing two of her rapists 
   in an auto junkyard. She kills the third one (the one who killed 
   Luca) by burning him alive. Inspector Modica and Arrighi put two and 
   two together and the chase is on. Will they capture Daniela before 
   she kills anyone else? The answer is found in the Forest of Sales, 
   the same location where her ancestor was killed (There is also an 
   epilogue where a narrator explains that Elena died in an insane 
   asylum and the Count committed suicide!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This atmospheric thriller (originally titled <B><A HREF="werewolf_woman_1976_italy.htm">LA

   written by Rino Di Silvestro (<B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#WomenCellBlock71973">WOMEN

    WOMEN OF THE SS SPECIAL SECTION</A></B> - 1976), is less about 
   horror and more about a woman's fragile psyche. The nudity and sex in 
   this film almost reach pornographic levels, as Silvestro has a habit 
   of showing Daniela's vagina in extreme close-up, something not 
   acceptable in films of this type back in the '70s and even up to this 
   day in the United States. If you have seen the U.S. theatrical 
   version, titled <B><A HREF="legend_of_the_wolf_woman_1976.htm">THE

   is missing over ten minutes of footage, most of it extreme nudity 
   &amp; sex and graphic gory violence (Silvestro is listed as &quot;R.D.
    Silver&quot; on the prints of this cut). This film would not have 
   worked if not for the exceptional, brave performance of Annik Borel, 
   who exposes her soul (and so much more!) for all of us to see. She is 
   simply fantastic. Frederick Stafford died a tragic death in 1979 at 
   the age of 51 when a plane he was traveling in crashed into another 
   plane mid-flight over Lugano, Switzerland. The DVD &amp; Blu-Ray, 
   from Raro Video, is the only way to watch this film. It is uncut 
   (except for the one scene I mentioned earlier) and in widescreen, 
   with the option to watch it in Italian with English subtitles or 
   English dubbed. When I have this choice, I always go for the original 
   language, even though it is obvious Stafford and other actors were 
   speaking English. The disc also contains a 2008 interview with 
   Silvestro (he passed away in 2009), who is very passionate about this 
   film (he calls it a &quot;tragic, terrifying pathology&quot;). This 
   was his first film where he had complete control and he is proud of 
   it. You will be, too. It's not pretty, but life is not pretty, is it?

    world has gone insane and those who suffer the most are always the 
   children.&quot; Those words are the basis for this unnerving film 
   and, once you view it, I doubt you will ever look at children the 
   same way again. Husband Tom (Lewis Fiander) and pregnant wife Evelyn 
   (Prunella Ransome) take a vacation in Spain and plan on spending a 
   couple of weeks on the secluded island of Almanzora, a place Tom 
   visited twelve years earlier. After a short hectic stay on the 
   mainland (where Evelyn complains that it's too crowded and, unknownst 
   to them, two slashed adult bodies have washed ashore), they rent a 
   boat and make the four hour trip to Almanzora. When they arrive on 
   the island, they are greeted by children but, strangely, no adults 
   are present. As they walk through the town, the lack of any adults <A HREF="who_can_kill_a_child_1975b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/who can kill a child dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="133" HEIGHT="192" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>becomes
    extremely obvious, especially when they visit a bar, grocery store 
   and, finally, the hotel and nothing but children are around. When 
   they finally do see an old man, they are shocked to see a young girl 
   beating him with his cane. Tom intervenes, but it is too late, the 
   old man is dead. Hoping to shield his wife from the carnage, he 
   carries the old man away. On his way back to his wife, Tom hears 
   children laughing and spies on them using an adult corpse as a human 
   pinata, a small girl striking at the body with a sickle while 
   blindfolded. Disgusted by what he sees, Tom decides not to tell his 
   wife what he saw, hoping to protect her pregnancy. A series of eerie 
   phone calls, where the woman on the other end begs for help, 
   immediately causes Tom to search the town more thoroughly. He finds 
   the hideously mutilated bodies of some of the town's adults (and also 
   views a bunch of boys stripping a female corpse) and locates a man 
   who was hiding from the kids. The man tells Tom that all the children 
   on the island woke up at the same time one recent morning, formed 
   groups and then went house-to-house, killing every adult they found. 
   When Tom asks him why no one fought back, the man simply replies, <A HREF="who_can_kill_a_child_1975.htm">&quot;Who
    can kill a child?&quot;</A> Tom and Evelyn (who also have two other 
   children back home) will have to soon answer that question for 
   themselves, as the children target them next. Will they be able to 
   kill children, even though Evelyn has one growing in her belly? Just 
   as in real life, nothing turns out the way we hope it will.&nbsp; 
   This is not an easy film to watch. The subject matter of this 
   extremely well-made film is a difficult subject to tackle and 
   director Narciso Ibanez Serrador (<B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#HouseScreamed1969">THE
    HOUSE THAT SCREAMED</A></B> - 1969) handles it in a way that's 
   terrifying without being exploitative. The film opens with newsreel 
   footage of how children have suffered at the hands of adults and 
   their follies, from the Nazi concentration camps of WWII Germany to 
   most of the major disastrous events up till 1975. It's never really 
   conclusively explained why the children are suddenly killing adults, 
   but after viewing the opening documentary footage, no conclusive 
   explanation is needed. It does seem, though, that the condition is 
   spread through touch, as is implied by something that happens to 
   Evelyn towards the finale. When the first child is killed, it's still 
   a shock, even though you know it has to happen. Since this isn't a 
   horror film in the truest sense, the childrens' deaths pack more of a 
   gut-punch than real horror films like <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Children1980">THE
    CHILDREN</A></B> (1980) and <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Beware Children">BEWARE:

    VICE IS A LOCKED ROOM AND ONLY I HAVE THE KEY</A><A NAME="YourViceLockedRoom"></A> 
   (1972) -</B> In this loose adaption of Edgar Allan Poe's &quot;The 
   Black Cat&quot;, abusive husband Oliviero (Luigi Pistilli) shames his 
   wife Irina (Anita Strindberg) at a party at their mansion (he mixes 
   all the guests' drinks into a bowl and then makes her drink it) and 
   then feels-up the black maid Brenda (while announcing to everyone, 
   &quot;Who knows if a night with a Negress isn't everyone's secret 
   dream?&quot;). Oliviero has deep-seated mother issues (his dead 
   mother is an infamous Countess who went mad) as well as being a 
   ladies man and best-selling author who's going through a major case 
   of writer's block. When Oliviero's mistress (and former student) 
   Fausto (Daniella Giordano) is brutally murdered when a gloved killer 
   slits her throat with a curved knife, the police inspector (Franco 
   Nebbia) questions Oliviero, but Irina gives him an alibi even though 
   she knows he wasn't home at the time of the murder. Brenda is the 
   killer's next victim (she has her stomach slit open with the curved 
   knife) while Oliviero's black cat, Satan, watches. When Irina and 
   Oliviero discover Brenda's body, they decide to hide it in a basement 
   wall behind some casks of wine (shades of another Poe story) because 
   Oliviero is afraid the police will blame him. The sudden appearance 
   of Oliviero's sexy niece, Floriana (Edwige <A HREF="your_vice_is_a_locked_room_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/your vice is a locked room and only i have the key dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="172" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>Fenech),
    throws a monkey wrench into their tranquil and murder-filled lives. 
   When someone sends them the dress Brenda was murdered in (it's 
   actually Oliviero's mother's dress), it throws Irina and Oliviero 
   into a further panic. The sexually liberated Floriana asks Oliviero 
   if it was true he slept with his mother, so he calls her a whore. 
   When Oliviero locks Irina in a closet, Floriana frees her and Irina 
   tells Floriana everything that is going on (They then have a hot 
   lesbian encounter). As Floriana and Irina plot against Oliviero, a 
   local hooker is viciously slaughtered by a man using the same curved 
   knife as the previous murders, but the bordello madame kills him. The 
   police are satisfied that they've got their killer, but it's plain to 
   see that Floriana is playing Irina against Oliviero and vice-versa. 
   Irina stabs Oliviero in the neck with a pair of scissors and hides 
   his body next to Brenda's in the basement wall. Problem is, she 
   accidentally seals Satan up with the bodies and all her careful 
   planning is undone by Satan's meowing when the police pay a visit to 
   the mansion. Irina's hatred of the cat proves to be her 
   downfall.&nbsp; This is an excellent example of the early 70's 
   Italian giallo genre. Besides Dario Argento, no one other than Sergio 
   Martino (who directed this) was more prolific in this genre. With 
   films like <B><A HREF="#StrangeViceWardh71">THE STRANGE VICE OF MRS. WARDH</A></B>

   novelist who is holding a family secret as well as suffering from a 
   three year bout of writer's block. Satan, the aptly-named black cat, 
   plays an important role in setting the mood. His echoing meows 
   foretell every murder, even after Irina stabs one of his eyes out 
   with some pruning shears. Riccardo Salvino also stars as 
   milkman/motorcycle racer Dario, a love interest for Floriana, who 
   gets the funniest bit of dialogue when he crashes his motorcycle 
   during a race. He gets up, looks at his damaged motorcycle and 
   screams, &quot;Stupid bitch of a rotten mother of a lousy no-good 
   psycho!&quot; It's not only funny, but prophetic of the revelation of 
   one of the character's background during the finale. Co-star Ivan 
   Rassimov's (<B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Sacrifice!1972">THE MAN FROM 
   DEEP RIVER</A></B> - 1972) role is kept as a surprise until the 
   finale (I won't spoil it for you here) and his screen time can't be 
   more than three minutes total. <B>VICE</B> also contains some great 
   camerawork, a wicked sense of decadence and a beautiful music score. 
   Noshame Films has released a great-looking widescreen DVD with your 
   choice of watching it in it's original Italian language (with 
   optional English subtitles) or the dubbed English soundtrack. It also 
   contains recent interviews with Martino, co-scripter Gastaldi and
