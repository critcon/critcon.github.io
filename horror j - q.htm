    BROOKS: MONSTER SLAYER</A><A NAME="JackBrooksMonsterSl"></A> (2007) -</B> 
   Fun horror film that relies more on practical effects and very little 
   CGI, making for a refreshing change of pace. Jack Brooks (Trevor 
   Matthews; who also co-produced and received a story credit) has 
   become an angry young man, who easily loses his temper when even 
   slightly provoked, thanks to a traumatic event that happened when he 
   was a young boy, where he watched helplessly (and frozen in fear) as 
   his entire family was slaughtered by a monster while camping in the 
   woods. Now in his twenties, Jack realizes he needs professional help, 
   so he goes to a psychiatrist, Dr. Silverstein (Daniel Kash), who 
   seems to think Jack is beyond psychiatric help. Jack's nagging shrew 
   of a girlfriend, Eve (Rachel Skarsten), makes him go to night school 
   to better himself, where science teacher Professor Gordon Crowley 
   (Robert Englund) takes note that Jack is a plumber and invites him to 
   his creaky old house in the middle of nowhere to fix his pipes. Jack 
   ends up screwing-up the plumbing even worse and the increased 
   pressure in the pipes leads to the unleashing of an ancient evil that 
   possesses the Professor. Jack needs an outlet to release all his 
   pent-up anger (Dr. Silverstein offers Jacks several useless 
   suggestions, including <A HREF="jack_brooks_monster_slayer_2007b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/jack brooks monster slayer dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Tai-Chi
    and yoga, and Jack's response to him is one of the funniest lines in 
   the film) and the events of the proceeding days will offer him that 
   outlet. Professor Crowley discovers a crate buried in his backyard 
   and digs it up, discovering a bunch of human bones and a beating 
   human heart inside. Some supernatural force makes the Professor eat 
   the heart and he begins to slowly transform into some hideous 
   monster. Jack and the rest of the night school class immediately 
   notice the Professor's weird behavior (Maybe the Professor 
   throwing-up on the blackboard was their first clue?), but chalk it up 
   to his already-strange personality. The Professor begins getting an 
   insatiable appetite (he eats his own dog!) and starts sprouting 
   tentacles from his stomach, which he cuts off with a pair of 
   scissors. Hardware store owner Howard (David Fox) tells Jack the 
   story of when he was a boy and had to kill his Uncle when he became 
   possessed by the heart (it's a Japanese demon of some sort). He blew 
   his Uncle away with a shotgun when he bit off some of Howard's 
   fingers and then buried him in a crate in the backyard of his Uncle's 
   house (now the Professor's house), along with the cursed heart. To 
   make a long story short, the Professor transforms into a 
   multi-tentacled monster and begins transforming all his night school 
   students into grotesque monsters. Jack becomes quite adept at killing 
   these creatures and finally has found his outlet to release all his 
   pent-up hostility. So, adept, in fact, that he takes this job full 
   time, first returning to the forest and killing the creature that 
   killed his family years before and then traveling around the world to 
   rid it of monsters (the last time we see him, he's fighting a nasty 
   Cyclops in an African village).&nbsp; Although it takes a while to 
   get to the actual monster-bashing, first-time feature director Jon 
   Knautz (who previously directed several horror and sci-fi-themed 
   shorts, including <B><A HREF="teen_massacre_2004.htm">TEEN MASSACRE</A></B> 
   [2004] and the acclaimed <B><A HREF="still_life_2005.htm">STILL LIFE</A></B> 
   [2005], which convinced Robert Englund to take the role as the 
   Professor here) injects a lot of humor and interesting characters 
   into the screenplay he co-wrote with John Ainslie. Particularly good 
   are Trevor Matthews as Jack (his scenes with the psychiatrist and 
   Howard are priceless) and Robert Englund as the Professor. The old 
   school special effects, which consist of plenty of latex, bladders 
   and buckets of slime, should make you feel like you are back in the 
   80's, as they have that comfortable, low-tech feel. Sure, they all 
   look fake, especially the creature that the professor transforms into 
   (it looks like Jabba The Hut's cousin), but they are fun to watch, 
   which makes all the difference in the world when compared to all 
   those cheap CGI monsterfests made today, especially for the Sci-Fi 
   Channel. The monsters seem comfortable in their environments, as 
   opposed to being inserted later on by some computer animator. <B><A HREF="jack_brooks_monster_slayer_2007b.htm">JACK
    BROOKS: MONSTER SLAYER</A></B> is a nice throwback to the creature 
   features of yore and I expressly hope that more young filmmakers put 
   down their computers and start making more movies like this. Well 
   done, everyone! Also starring Stefanie Drummond, James A. Woods

   Eve and too stoned to notice that Jack is noticing it, too), Dean

    OF SATAN</A><A NAME="JawsOfSatan1981"></A> (1981) -</B> This film 
   really makes me wonder how corporate executives operate. Why in the 
   world would they give Bob Claver, a director of mostly sitcoms on TV, 
   the directorial reins of what is his only theatrical feature? The 
   closest thing Claver came to to directing horror on TV is two 
   episodes of <B><A HREF="dukes_of_hazzard.htm">THE DUKES OF HAZZARD</A></B> 
   (1979), four episodes of <B><A HREF="munsters_today_tv_series_1988.htm">THE
    MUNSTERS TODAY</A></B> (1988 - 1989) and 62 episodes of the mostly 
   forgotton sci-fi sitcom <B><A HREF="out_of_this_world_tv_series_1987.htm">OUT
    OF THIS WORLD</A></B> (1987 - 1991). I'm not kidding. This R-Rated 
   atrocity is to horror as asking Jerry Mathers to play &quot;The 
   Beaver&quot; in a porn parody of his classic 50's &amp; 60's TV 
   series. I consider this the anti-horror horror film and once United 
   Artist and MGM (who still owns it) executives looked at the final 
   product, they knew they had a stinker of the highest order<A HREF="jaws_of_satan_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/jaws of satan poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   on their hands (just the name itself plays off the 1975 Steven 
   Spielberg classic and <B><A HREF="final_conflict_1981.htm">THE FINAL CONFLICT</A></B>,
    the second sequel to <B><A HREF="omen_1976.htm">THE OMEN</A></B> 
   franchise, which was released the same year, and the plot does 
   resemble <B><A HREF="jaws_1975.htm">JAWS</A></B> a lot [a giant 
   creature terrorizing a town just before a big opening], while using 
   quotes from the Bible to play-up the supernatural angle), but since 
   they already had posters printed up for this turd, they gave it a 
   minimum regional theatrical release in the United States and dumped 
   it on to foreign territories under the name <B><A HREF="king_cobra_1981.htm">KING
    COBRA</A></B> (the title the print on this Blu-Ray actually bears) 
   before giving it a limited VHS release through Wood Knapp. Then 
   Christina Applegate became a bankable star (she appears in this film 
   when she was ten years old and spends approximately 5 minutes on 
   screen, maximum) and MGM re-released it in 1998, but people still 
   knew a turd smelled like shit no matter what year it was made and the 
   release was quickly abandoned. What it did do was attract the usual 
   vultures from eBay and Amazon sellers, who were selling VHS &amp; 
   DVD-R boots of this film for outrageous prices, not bothering to tell 
   the buyers that they would smell the delivery in the mail coming a 
   few days before it reached their mailbox. Hell, it never even had an 
   official DVD release in the U.S., so that should tell you something 
   right there. So imagine my surprise when Scream Factory released this 
   on a <A HREF="empire_of_the_ants_1977_jaws_of_satan_1981_blu-ray.htm">double
    feature Blu-Ray</A> (with Bert I. Gordon's much more fun <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#EmpireOfTheAnts77">EMPIRE
    OF THE ANTS</A></B> - 1977), which made me buy this sucker, because 
   that is exactly what I am when it comes to watching bad films. And, 
   boy, is this bad! The film opens up on a train (a multi-car train 
   with only three people aboard!), where one guy complains about the 
   barking dogs he is in charge of, while another guy says he has a king 
   cobra locked in a box and it has been sleeping the entire trip. Or so 
   he thinks. When the guy goes to another car to check on the dogs, 
   both doors to the train car lock by themselves and the padlock on the 
   king cobra's cage opens by itself. Suddenly, the double doors on the 
   side of the car opens and the guy is thrown out of the speeding train 
   as if by some supernatural force and then the king cobra comes 
   face-to-face with its handler (you can plainly see the glass 
   partition between the guy and the snake, just like Harrison Ford and 
   the snakes in <B><A HREF="raiders_of_the_lost_ark_1981.htm">RAIDERS 
   OF THE LOST ARK</A></B> (1981). The king cobra bites its handler on 
   his face (we never actually see any snake bites in this film, only 
   the after-effects, and since the film is about snakes, I fail to see 
   the point as to why this film was made) and the train suddenly stops 
   on its own (we later find out that the engineer was bitten by a 
   rattlesnake). The screen then goes black when this suddenly appears: 
   &quot;And the angel seized the serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, 
   and bound him for a thousand years...after that he must be loosed for 
   a little while.&quot; REVELATIONS 20: 2,3 (Now just wait a goddamn 
   minute: Aren't the Devil and Satan the same fallen angel? And how 
   much time is &quot;a little while&quot;? 24 hours? A week? A month? A 
   century? Already, I'm more confused than a one-legged man at an 
   ass-kicking contest.). We then see Father Tom Farrow (Fritz Weaver; <B><A HREF="creepshow_1983.htm">CREEPSHOW</A></B> 
   - 1983) enjoying his dinner and telling his housekeeper this joke: <B>Q:</B> 
   &quot;Do you know why a pig is like a saint?&quot; <B>A:</B> &quot;He 
   gets more praise after he's dead than alive.&quot; The housekeeper 
   reprimands him by saying, &quot;That's not the type of joke one 
   expects to hear from a priest!&quot; and he apologizes (It seems to 
   me that Father Farrow (or Fritz Weaver himself) liked his wine a 
   little too much during this film. My bet is that Weaver knew he was 
   making a piece of crap and tried to stay inebriated throughout. We 
   then are at a party thrown by town patriarch Matt Perry (Bob Hannah), 
   who is celebrating the opening of a dog track in town in a couple of 
   days. Father Farrow (who is against the dog track because he believes 
   gambling is a sin) meets Evelyn Downs (Diana Douglas, mother to 
   actor/producer Michael Douglas, who passed away in July of 2015), a 
   self-professed witch who passes out when she touches Father Farrow's 
   cup (Alcohol poisoning? Just kidding.). He walks Evelyn to her car, 
   where she tells him he is in terrible danger and has a powerful 
   enemy. She tells Father Farrow that Satan is after him and wants his 
   soul. Evelyn is positive she is right and deep-down inside, Father 
   Farrow does, too (But what priest is not the object of Satan's 
   desires? Isn't that one of Satan's duties?). The train is located and 
   the snake handler is found barely alive (The engineer bitten by the 
   rattler will be OK after given a shot of anti-venom). He is brought 
   to the hospital and looked after by Dr. Maggie Sheridan (Gretchen 
   Corbett; <B><A HREF="lets_scare_jessica_to_death_1971.htm">LET'S 
   SCARE JESSICA TO DEATH</A></B> - 1971), who has never seen a snake 
   bite like this and calls in Father Farrow to give her patient the 
   Last Rites because he is going to die. She hopes to find out more 
   about what bit her former patient by the coroner, but all he can do 
   is show her his body (his face is all swollen, this film's idea of 
   horror) and tell her that he must have been bitten by a renegade 
   snake that he has never seen before. Maggie calls in herpetologist 
   Dr. Paul Hendricks (John Korkes; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Syngenor1990">SYNGENOR</A></B> 
   - 1990) to look at the corpse, much to the displeasure of Matt Perry, 
   who thinks this will disrupt the opening of his dog track (Remind you 
   of any film?). When Maggie and Paul get to the coroner's office, the 
   corpse and coroner have disappeared and dollars to donuts you can bet 
   this is the work of Mayor Thorpe, (Jack Gordan; Matt Perry has his 
   hand so far up the Mayor's ass, he could use him as a ventriloquist 
   dummy). Father Farrow gets a phone call from Evelyn, who makes him 
   promise to stay inside for the night. She has something important to 
   tell him and she is driving over to talk to him. There is another 
   deadly snake bite and Paul gets to see this one. Unfortunately, the 
   victim is Evelyn. Sheriff Tatum (John McCurry) keeps getting phone 
   calls and reports of snakes all over town (it turns out that the king 
   cobra is able to control all the snakes in the area) and a 
   rattlesnake slithers into Maggie's bathtub just as she is about to 
   take a shower (some quick fleeting nudity in what is probably 
   Corbett's stand-in). When she steps in the tub, the rattlesnake is 
   gone, but when she gets into bed, it is there waiting for her. She 
   calls Paul on the phone to come over ASAP to save her. Paul goes 
   running down the stairs of the only motel in town (In what is 
   obviously a mistake, a painting falls off the wall. Everyone who has 
   stayed in a motel knows that paintings are screwed into the walls so 
   no one can steal them.) and rushes over to Maggie's house. He pins 
   the rattlesnake to the wall and blows it's head off with a pistol he 
   is carrying (Well, the head doesn't exactly blown off as it just take 
   a bullet hit to the head and dies). Maggie and Paul become lovers 
   (Anyone surprised by that?) When Father Farrow learns of Evelyn's 
   death, he is now fully convinced something evil has taken over the 
   town, especially when he learns she died of a snake bite. He goes to 
   the Monsignoire (Norman Lloyd; <B><A HREF="amityville_4_1989.htm">AMITYVILLE
    4: THE EVIL ESCAPES</A></B> - 1989) to voice his concerns. The 
   Monsignoire is not surprised at all and tells Father Farrow that the 
   satanic snake is real and Farrow's family is closely involved with 
   it. He tells Father Farrow that the snake is the reason why his 
   father committed suicide (Father Farrow never knew that about his 
   father) and the snake goes after every third generation of Farrows 
   (Father Farrow is not a third generation Farrow, but the Monsignoire 
   makes up some supernatural mumbo-jumbo to make it seem like the snake 
   doesn't care. You'll be scratching your head until it bleeds.). The 
   Monsignoire tells Father Farrow to be very careful because, &quot;A 
   priest will make a bright flame in Hell.&quot; More and more snake 
   attacks occur, but the Mayor puts a lid on it with the Press and TV 
   news, obviously influenced by Matt Perry and the precious opening of 
   his dog track. Deputy Jack (Larry Jordan) is attacked and killed by 
   the king cobra while Father Farrow is conducting <A HREF="king_cobra_1981.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/king cobra aka jaws of satan poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Evelyn's
    funeral outside. Father Farrow (who loses his crucifix at Evelyn's 
   grave) and the Monsignoire are chased through the graveyard by the 
   king cobra (the Monsignoire suffers a fatal heart attack) and Father 
   Farrow falls into an open grave, but he make a crucifix out a piece 
   of iron gate and the king cobra disappears. Matt Perry gives Father 
   Farrow, Maggie and Paul eighteen hours to find and kill the snake. No 
   matter what, the dog track will open, but he will ruin their careers 
   just for the hell of it. That night, little Elizabeth Perry 
   (Christina Applegate) runs outside to retrieve her cat and when she 
   comes back inside, her mother, Elizabeth (Nancy Priddy), grounds her, 
   which means she will not be able to go to the dog track opening in 
   the morning. That doesn't stop her, as she sneaks into the dog track, 
   only to be bitten by a rattlesnake (again, we don't see the snake 
   actually bite her). Elizabeth rushes to get her daughter medical 
   care, while her unfeeling father still wants to open the dog track. 
   The Mayor finds a chance to grow a set of balls and tells Matt that 
   the track will not be opening that day and Elizabeth makes Matt stay 
   behind while she has their daughter taken to the hospital, as 
   punishment for putting everything else over his family. Paul finds 
   the king cobra's hiding place in a cavern, but he slips and knocks 
   himself out when he hits his head on some rocks. Maggie locates Paul 
   in the cavern and they both find themselves trapped by the snake, but 
   right in the middle of giving Mass at his church, Father Farrow has a 
   vision and leaves the church with his congregation looking confused. 
   Father Farrow heads for the caverns and performs a really quick 
   exorcism on the snake and it catches on fire. The fight between good 
   and evil has been fought and good wins out, as the film fades to 
   black for the end credits with the king cobra on fire.&nbsp; There's 
   not much positive to say about this abomination, except to say there 
   are too many &quot;What The Fuck?!?&quot; moments in this film, such 
   as when Matt Perry hires a biker (Mike Smith) to run Maggie off the 
   road to rape her (he also sticks a gun in her mouth), only to get 
   scared off by the king cobra. There is also a shot of a mouse being 
   killed in a spring trap that serves no purpose in the film. It's 
   clear that director Bob Claver has no idea what a horror film should 
   look like because this is a dreary 92 minute affair that has almost 
   no horror in it. The only thing that can remotely be described as 
   horror are the looks of the snake handler and Evelyn's faces after 
   they have been bitten by the cobra. Otherwise, it's just POV of 
   snakes attacking and a total lack of gore and blood. It also comes as 
   no surprise that this was screenwriter Gerry Holland and producer 
   Bill Wilson's only film credit. This film is a failure of the highest 
   order and if you want to see how not to make a horror film, by all 
   means watch this. Dean Cundey does give the film a nice polished look 
   with his cinematography, but like they say, you can put a pretty bow 
   on an ugly pig, but it will still be an ugly pig. For bad film 
   fanatics only. I know that I will enjoy the other feature on this 
   Blu-Ray a helluva lot more than this abortion and I have seen that 
   one at least a dozen times. The theatrical trailer (the only extra 
   for this film) contains footage not seen in the film. You will spot 
   it right away as soon as you see it. Also starring Alene Simmons, 
   Mary Lyons McEvoy, Bill Gribble, Jamie Lawrence, David Fawcett, Sarah 
   Wilson and Mark Richards. A <A HREF="http://www.screamfactorydvd.com">Scream

   is no property there is no injustice&quot; - John Locke.</B> Why is 
   it that many b-horror films feel they must start with some obscure 
   quotation? The film opens with two bankers driving up to Jebadiah's 
   (Billy Leo; also a Co-Producer and Weapons Stunt Coordinator) 
   property while he is chopping wood. They tell Jebadiah that his house 
   and his land are no longer his because he hasn't paid taxes on them 
   for five years. The county is about to take away everything Jebadiah 
   calls home (even though he bought everything years ago fair and 
   square) simply over taxes (I look at it this way: If you buy a 
   refrigerator or car and pay fully for it, why should you hand over 
   the county more money for it? And since Jebadiah lives deep in the 
   forest, why should he have to pay taxes since he is nowhere near 
   anyone else and interacting with no one? I'm on Jebadiah's side here 
   on this issue only, especially after the country discovered how banks 
   screwed people with their balloon mortgages.). Jebadiah now has a 
   shotgun in his hand and shoots one of the bankers dead when he tells 
   him that the Sheriff will stop by to throw him off his land. The 
   other banker runs to his car while Jebadiah yells they will have to 
   kill him before he leaves. The Sheriff, Dan Norris (John Baran), and 
   the other banker return (the dead banker is leaning against a tree 
   with a cardboard &quot;No <A HREF="jebadiahs_axe_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/jebadiah's axe poster10 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="238" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Trespassing&quot;
    sign in his hands), where the Sheriff and Jebadiah get into a 
   Mexican standoff. Jebadiah shoots the Sheriff in the leg and the 
   Sheriff shoots Jebadiah in the chest, killing him. The callous 
   Sheriff makes banker Lou (Rod Hermansen) dig a shallow grave away 
   from the house and hidden in the woods and bury Jebadiah in it, 
   saying no one is going to miss him if the grave is deep enough and 
   the coyotes don't drag him away. The Sheriff also says that they are 
   within their legal rights to do this (They are not. What about an 
   autopsy and a death certificate?). The Sheriff also tells Lou that he 
   should have killed Jebadiah two years ago, when Jebadiah killed his 
   wife for having an affair with Lou, but he covered everything up for 
   his friend. In other words, he guilts Lou into doing whatever he 
   says. We then see four semi-young adults about to buy Jebadiah's land 
   from real estate agent Dawn (Denise McMillan). Right away the horror 
   tropes start when they discover that there is no cell phone service 
   in the area (in this day and age, something I find hard to believe 
   since they are not even in the woods yet). The foursome equate having 
   no cell service as the same thing as having no indoor plumbing or 
   electricity (right away, I wanted to kill them myself). They all head 
   into town and mention how empty the town is (even though we see 
   reflections in store windows of plenty of cars and trucks whizzing 
   by) and head to Luigi's Restaurant to eat and then find Dawn's 
   office, when a stranger named Charlie (Earl Loveday) tells the 
   foursome the history of Jebadiah. Rose Melendez (Deborah Funes), one 
   of the worst actresses I have seen in a while (not to mention her 
   over-collagened lips), fiance Mike (Kirby Little) and friends Beth 
   (Sheri Davis) &amp; Todd (Tim Newkirk) will each chip in 25% of the 
   asking price of Jebadiah's land if they like what they see, the 
   legend of Jebadiah be damned (I wish Rose would keep her puffy lips 
   shut for the rest of the movie. Her accent, along with her horrendous 
   line readings, pull you right out of the film. And she is the star!). 
   The foursome and Dawn head to Jebadiah's land where Dawn tells them 
   the locals won't touch the land because they are too afraid of 
   Jebadiah, even though he has disappeared and no one has seen him for 
   years. The county took the land and the house and are selling it 
   cheaply to a bunch of rubes who don't know the real story. After 
   arriving at their destination, Todd finds Jebadiah's grave within 
   minutes (I guess the Sheriff and Lou didn't do a good job hiding the 
   grave!) and Dawn drives away, telling them to meet her back at her 
   office in thirty minutes because darkness is approaching. Todd is 
   walking in the woods when Jebadiah appears and plants an axe in 
   Todd's chest (&quot;Stay off my land!&quot;). Dawn heads to Luigi's 
   when the foursome don't show up at her office and she tells the 
   Sheriff about the grave they found there. The visibly worried-looking 
   Sheriff says he will check it out in the morning and Dawn says she is 
   heading back to Jebadiah's place because she doesn't want to lose the 
   sale. Beth finds Todd's dead body and then is strangled by Jebadiah 
   until she passes out. She is then hung from a tree while Jebadiah 
   says, &quot;I told you to stay off my land!&quot; Rose and Mike 
   become worried about their friends when they are late coming back, 
   and Mike says he is going to look for them, telling Rose to stay 
   where she is in case they come back. Beth, who is still alive hanging 
   from the tree, manages to get a small scream off before Jebadiah 
   plants his axe in her head. The waitress at Luigi's and her cook 
   boyfriend sneak onto Jebadiah's land for some sex (the only nudity in 
   the film and it seems this scene was inserted to supply nudity and 
   increase the small body count, as well as to increase the film's 
   meager 69 minute running time, barely making it a movie). After sex, 
   the cook walks into the woods to take a leak, only for his shoulder 
   to be sliced wide open by Jebadiah's sharp axe. The waitress runs 
   around the woods screaming in her bra and panties until Jebadiah 
   catches and kills her. Rose says, &quot;What the hell is going 
   on?&quot; (It actually sounds like &quot;Vat da hell ist goin' 
   on?&quot;). She yells out to Mike, &quot;I am lost and I am 
   ascared!&quot; and Mike yells out not to move. He will find her. The 
   cook is still alive, crawling on the ground, when Jebadiah finishes 
   him off. Dawn makes it back to the property and discovers the grave 
   is now empty. Jebadiah then stabs her several times in the chest with 
   hedge clippers (She give an award-winning performance on how to die 
   on camera. Just kidding. She is awful.). While the Sheriff is pulling 
   Lou out of his house, Mike spots Beth's headless body hanging from 
   the tree. Jebadiah knocks Mike out and then Rose watches as Jebadiah 
   plants his axe into Mike's head and then chases her. The Sheriff and 
   Lou arrive on Jebadiah's property, where they discover the empty 
   grave&nbsp; and Dawn dead. Rose runs right into the arms of the 
   Sheriff. He puts six bullets into Jebadiah's chest to no effect and 
   they all head back to Lou's place. Too many people are involved for 
   the Sheriff to cover Lou's ass (We see flashbacks of Jebadiah slicing 
   his wife with a knife over and over after catching her making love to 
   Lou.). Jebadiah shows up at Lou's house and kills Lou's wife outside, 
   while Rose sees him through a window. Jebadiah cuts off the Sheriff's 
   hand and plants his axe into Lou's face, killing them both. He looks 
   at Rose and says, &quot;Stay off my land!&quot; and walks away. Like 
   some kind of retarded idiot, Rose heads back to Jebadiah's property 
   to get some revenge for her friends' deaths. She grabs a chainsaw and 
   says she wants to cut his &quot;bulls&quot; off, but the chainsaw 
   refuses to start (Rule of thumb: Make sure your weapon of death 
   works.). Charlie (Remember him?) throws gasoline on Jebadiah and he 
   runs into the woods on fire. Charlie tells Rose to forget about her 
   friends, leave this town and get on with her life. Rose says 
   &quot;Thanks&quot; and then this obscure quotation appears on screen: <B>&quot;While
    seeking revenge, dig two graves - one for yourself.&quot; - Douglas Horton.</B>&nbsp;
    This barely feature length film is still a slog to get through, 
   thanks to the acting debut of Deborah Funes, who has an uncanny way 
   of mispronouncing the simplest of words and probably can't say them 
   right because of those fat, collagen-filled lips. Why do women think 
   that look is sexy? It looks like her boyfriend/husband has abused her 
   by punching her in the mouth. Just by looking at her, it is plain to 
   see that she had some other plastic surgery done and a woman that 
   young should learn to love her real looks, because if all she can get 
   is films like this, she's better off bussing tables. I hate 
   plastic-looking women. It's getting harder and harder to find a real 
   untampered-with woman in films like this. This regional Quinlan, 
   Texas-made horror film (shot in 10 days and it looks it) shows death 
   mainly by axe (although a couple of other weapons are used) and most 
   of the deaths are practical, but nothing to write home about. While 
   we see plenty of blood (mostly after the fact, but Beth's headless 
   body is the film's standout), we are never really told why and how 
   Jebadiah was able to rise from his grave. In other words, there are 
   more questions than answers. Director/screenwriter Jim DeVault also 
   directed the &quot;Blood Reunion&quot; trilogy, which includes <B><A HREF="blood_reunion_2012.htm">BLOOD

    students, led by Sandra Tremayne (Amy Johnston), who calls Jennifer 
   a &quot;hayseed&quot; and a &quot;hillbilly&quot;. As we learned in <B>CARRIE</B>,
    you can only push a quiet girl so far before she reacts in strange, 
   violent ways and Jennifer is no different. When Jennifer was a little 
   girl, she experienced a traumatic incident in the snake-worshipping 
   church run by her hyper-religious father, Luke (Jeff Corey; <B><A HREF="messenger_of_death_1988.htm">MESSENGER
    OF DEATH</A></B> - 1988). Jennifer was a child prodigy of the church 
   and people came from miles around to watch her power to control 
   snakes, but when a snake-handling sermon goes wrong and some 
   parishioners are bitten and killed, Jennifer vows never to use her 
   powers again. That won't last very long now that she's attending 
   Green View. Sandra gets caught cheating on a mid-term test by teacher 
   Jeffrey Reed (Bert Convy; <B><A HREF="hanging_by_a_thread_1979.htm">HANGING
    BY A THREAD</A></B> - 1979), but she tries blaming Jennifer for her 
   mess. Jeffrey is having none of it and sends Sandra to the 
   Headmistress, Miss Calley (Nina Foch), who then blackmails Sandra's 
   rich father, Senator Tremayne (John Gavin), into making a 
   &quot;donation&quot; to the school to make his daughter's latest 
   problem go away. It seems Sandra has always been a problem child and 
   has been kicked-out of several schools for various serious 
   infractions, so Daddy warns her that if she gets into any more 
   trouble, he will disown her and send her to live with her 
   &quot;common&quot; mother. Of course, Sandra blames all her problems 
   on Jennifer and vows to make her life a living hell. Poor Jennifer, 
   not only does she have to put up with Sandra's constant harassment, 
   she also has to go home every night to her alcoholic father, who owns 
   a pet store and constantly reminds her (using fire and brimstone 
   sermons) that she should resume her life as a religious 
   snake-handler. Jennifer joins the school's swim team over her 
   father's protests (&quot;It's sinful!&quot;) and when Sandra tries to 
   drown her in the pool, Jennifer says enough is enough and uses her 
   supernatural powers for the first time since the fatal incident as a 
   child to make snakes materialize and then disappear in Sandra's 
   locker, scaring the shit out of her. Sandra retaliates by joining 
   with her boyfriend Dayton (Ray Underwood) in stealing Jennifer 
   clothes while she is taking a shower in the girls locker room, taking 
   photos of her in the nude and plastering the photos all over the 
   school. Jeffrey wants to help Jennifer, but she would rather deal 
   with it on her own. Sandra continues he<A HREF="jennifer_1978e.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/jennifer ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="115" HEIGHT="263" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>r
    harassment, killing Jennifer's favorite cat and having Dayton rape 
   ex-clique member Jane (Louise Hoven) for siding with Jennifer. Things 
   take a bad turn when Sandra and her clique kidnap Jennifer out of her 
   bedroom, put her in the trunk of a car and take her to the top of a 
   parking garage, where Dayton and his male friends terrorize her by 
   trying to run her over in their cars. Jennifer snaps and unleashes 
   her snake powers to deadly effect, where we learn the real extant of 
   her powers. No one is going to slither out of this mess, except for 
   Jennifer and new best friend Jane.&nbsp; The parallels to <B>CARRIE</B> 
   are numerous: A teen with psychic powers with a domineering 
   uber-religious parent; a shower scene that proves to be embarrassing 
   to the teen; an understanding teacher who tries to help the much 
   put-upon teen; a climatic finale where the teen suffers humiliation 
   in front of her peers, which forces her to unleash her powers to full 
   effect, resulting in death and destruction; and the title itself, 
   which is simply the teen's first name. Hell, if director Brice Mack (<B><A HREF="swap_meet_1979.htm">SWAP

   were any more blatant, I'm sure Stephen King and Brian DePalma would 
   have a winnable lawsuit on their hands. While <B><A HREF="jennifer_1978c.htm">JENNIFER</A></B> 
   is not a badly made film, it is far too restrained for it's own good. 
   Besides a brief bit of nudity by Lisa Pelikan and a spot of mild 
   violence and minimal cursing, this all plays like some subdued 70's 
   TV movie until the crazy finale, where Jennifer goes bonzo and 
   creates monster snakes with her mind that bite the cast (the giant 
   snake in Sandra's car is a hoot) and then simply disappear, leaving 
   some of the cast dead and others emotionally scarred for life. 
   Unfortunately, the rest of the film is full of inane teen chatter 
   (Where the girls argue over who is cuter, John Travolta or Warren 
   Beatty. They should see them now!), sub-par revenge tactics and very 
   little snake action. If you are going to make a knock-off of an 
   established hit, why on Earth would you make a toned-down PG-rated

   clutches of the street gang. Mike and Alice learn from Yang Sr. &amp; 
   Jr. that Uncle Lee is just one of a small force of gyonsii, all of 
   them killed by the street gang and they will remain vampires until 
   they can get justice and then pass on to the great beyond. The Yangs 
   are able to control the gyonsii by attaching slips of parchment with 
   Chinese spells written on them to their foreheads. When the 
   parchments are removed, they become active. Leech (Doug Silberstein), 
   the leader of the street gang, sends his goons to steal Uncle Lee's 
   body and the parchment falls off when they stuff him in a car trunk. 
   He ends up biting two gang members and hops around the city (even in

   him with a parchment. Leech and his gang go to Yang's warehouse, 
   where they kill Yang Sr. and take Alice prisoner. Yang Jr. and Mike 
   use the small army of gyonsii at their disposal to get their revenge,

    ROSES</A></B> - 1988) hasn't got a clue how to stage an action scene 
   (the martial arts fights are horrendous) or how to block a shot. The 
   film is purposely played as a comedy (at least I think it is), but I 
   didn't laugh once. I did, on the other hand, groan a bunch of times, 
   especially when Hong says, &quot;One hour after he bites you, he 
   wants to bite you again!&quot; or when one of the gang members 
   proclaims, &quot;I'm terrified beyond the capacity of rational 
   thought!&quot; I was bored beyond the point of no return. The acting

   hard to hear and the sound level increases tenfold whenever music

   Due to illegal fertilization experiments, seven baby brothers are 
   born from one fertilized egg. The baby brothers are called the 
   Johnsons, named after the doctor who performed the experiments and

   to fits of extreme violence (they tear apart their doctor). Today is 
   their 21st birthday. Meanwhile, Emalee (Esmee De La Bretoniere), who 
   is about to turn 14, is having nightmares about the Johnsons raping 
   her, even though she has never met or heard of them (her doctor 
   thinks she is having these nightmares because she has yet to begin 
   menstruating!). Her mother Victoria (Monique Van De Ven), a nature

   the Johnsons are being held captive. A college professor of 
   anthropology (Kenneth Herdigein) is hired by a government agency to 
   find out what makes the Johnsons behave the way they do. With help 
   from his old world father, the professor learns that Dr. Johnson once 
   visited the Mahxitu Indians and stole the fetus of their god 
   Xangadix. The legend states that Xangadix will bear seven sons who 
   will impregnate their sister. The birth will result in a creature 
   that will cause the destruction of mankind. The professor discovers 
   that Dr. Johnson used DNA from the stolen fetus in his fertilization 
   experiments and used eggs from a young Victoria while she was at the 
   orphanage (without her knowledge) to create the seven brothers. That 
   makes Emalee their sister. The brothers escape their prison (watch 
   out for the 'head of security' joke) and hunt down Emalee, who has

   (but it looks to the audience like it is only the severed head of a 
   deer) and stop the RV. Warren gets out but cannot spot the deer, so 
   he lies to Connie and tells her that he saw the deer run away. They 
   then stop at the outpost of Forest Ranger Roy Mclean (George Kennedy; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DeathShip1980">DEATH
    SHIP</A></B> - 1980) and when Warren tells them where they are 
   going, Roy says, &quot;Only a fool would do that!&quot;, to which 
   Warren replies, &quot;Well, we have five of them here.&quot; When Roy 
   wants to know their exact location so he can alert authorities to 
   where they can find their dead bodies, Warren lies to him and says 
   they are going to Silver Lake. The five friends proceed on with their 
   trip, when Daniel suddenly thinks he sees someone. They stop the RV 
   and meet Ty, who tells them that &quot;demons&quot; are after him. 
   They can smell the booze on his breath and write him off as a local 
   drunk and refuse to let him travel with them (Jonathan throws some 
   sandwiches out the window in case he is hungry!) and continue on with 
   their trip, but the fat inbred hillbilly jumps on the roof of their 
   RV and takes the ride with them (Ty notices this and begins to laugh, 
   knowing that he is now safe from the demons). The group travel as far 
   as the RV can take them and travel the rest of the way by foot, with 
   the fat hillbilly following them. They set up camp, but Warren and 
   Jonathan have to go back to the RV when they forget to bring the food 
   with them. As nightime approaches, Connie, Megan and Daniel become 
   worried about the other two not being back yet and they are sure 
   someone is watching them, but Warren and Jonathan come jumping from 
   out of the dark and scare the shit out of the trio (and tell them 
   that someone broke into the RV and stole all the food). The next 
   morning, they hear a girl singing by a pond and approach her, but she 
   runs away. They then cross a dangerous rope bridge (which Daniel 
   nearly fall off of) that stretches across a waterfall and, once they 
   get to the other side, they go down to the base of the waterfall, 
   where Megan takes a topless swim with Jonathan. She thinks that 
   Jonathan is fooling around with her underwater, but when she sees 
   Jonathan at the bank of the pond, she screams in fear because it is 
   obvious that the fat hillbilly is copping a feel. She gets away, but 
   Jonathan doesn't believe what she is saying. While they are all 
   getting drunk at night and dancing while their radio blares loudly, 
   they are visited by a hillbilly family, led by Pa Logan (Hap Oslund), 
   who shoots the radio and tells them all to leave because they have 
   &quot;raised the Devil&quot;. Ty makes it to Forest Ranger Joe's 
   outpost and tells them about the &quot;demons&quot; jumping on the 
   RV, so Joe jumps on his trusty horse Agatha and goes out to save 
   them. The singing girl, whose name is Merry Cat Logan (Kati Powell), 
   the daughter of Pa Logan, comes on to Jonathan and tells him she 
   liked watching him swim in his underwear the day before. She kisses 
   Jonathan and runs awy to the rope bridge and hides. Jonathan crosses 
   the rope bridge, only to have the fat hillbilly meet him at the end, 
   cut Jonathan's hand with the machete and then cut the rope to the 
   bridge, making Jonathan fall into the river, but he manages to hold 
   on to the rope so that he doesn't go over the waterfall. He climbs 
   the rope on the opposite side, only to meet the fat hillbilly at the 
   top (How is this possible?), who kicks Jonathan in the face and he 
   falls into the river below. Daniel and Megan find the abandoned 
   church and leave it because it has an awful smell. Daniel takes 
   photos of Megan in the graveyard, but loses his glasses (he need them 
   to see) and they both think they see Jonathan, so they fake making 
   out to get Jonathan jealous, only to discover too late that it is the 
   fat hillbilly, who stabs Daniel in the stomach with the machete and 
   chases Megan into the church. It is at this time when we find out how 
   the fat hillbilly can be at two places at once. They are twins! One 
   kills Megan in the church (he is wearing Daniel's glasses) while the 
   other one takes photos of the killing with Daniel's camera. While 
   Connie and Warren are wading at the bottom of the waterfall, 
   Jonathan's dead body falls at their feet and they now know they are 
   both in trouble. As nighttime approaches and Daniel and Megan don't 
   return to camp (they run into the Logan family again and Pa tells 
   them to get out of here), Daniel has to go back to where they left 
   Jonathan's dead body to get the RV keys out of his <A HREF="just_before_dawn_1980.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/just before dawn blu-ray front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="232" HEIGHT="267" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>pocket.
    Roy makes it to the Logan family house and asks Pa if he or his 
   family have seen the five campers. Pa lies and says no, but Merry Cat 
   stops Joe and tells him she will take them to their camp. It is at 
   this time we find out that the murderous twins are Merry Cat's 
   brothers. One of the twins chases Connie up a tree and starts to chop 
   it down with his machete, while Warren runs into Joe and they head to 
   the campsite. The murderous brother chops down the tree and Connie 
   falls down with it. Just as he is about to kill Connie with his 
   machete, Joe kills him with a few well placed shots from his rifle 
   (Joe says, &quot;You breed in the family for so long and something is 
   about to snap.&quot;). Not knowing that the dead brother has a twin, 
   Joe leaves Warren and Connie after telling them to get to the RV and 
   drive away while he goes and gets some help to retrieve the dead 
   bodies. When he is gone, the other brother seriously wounds Warren in 
   the side with his machete and then puts Connie in a bearhug. Connie 
   has had enough and, in the film's most memorable scene, she sticks 
   her fist in the brother's mouth and shoves it in up to her elbow (!), 
   killing the inbred twin brother. Warren and Connie get away after 
   Merry Cat watches what Connie has done. Beautifully directed by genre

   theatrical film for Jamie Rose], some in the middle [George Kennedy, 
   who is still alive at the time of this writing], and some nearing 
   their end [Mike Kellin would pass away in 1983]), this film hits all 
   the right notes in making a scary little horror film. While there are 
   some bloody spots, the film doesn't wallow in gore (makeup effects by 
   Matthew Mungle) and the screenplay, by Lieberman (as &quot;Gregg 
   Irving&quot;) and Mark Arywitz (his only one), based on a story by 
   Joseph Middleton (who is actually adult film director/screenwriter 
   Jonas Middleton; <B><A HREF="through_the_looking_glass_1976.htm">THROUGH
    THE LOOKING GLASS</A></B> - 1976), offers us enough clues (in both 
   the dialogue and situations) to reveal that the inbred fat hillbilly 
   is actually twins (watch it for a second time and see and hear for 
   yourself). If you want to see how an 80's horror film is done right, 
   mixing in the right amount of human drama, scares and gore, you could 
   do a lot worse than this one. Also starring John Hunsaker as the

   is another one of his films which begs to be rediscovered. It's a 
   psychological horror tale about a series of brutal sword murders that 
   take place at an isolated farmhouse owned by Leslie Fontaine (Camilla 
   Carr). She blames the murders on her long-lost husband Kevin, but it 
   becomes apparent to the viewer that Leslie is two cards short of a 
   deck. We find out later that Leslie is dressing up as her husband 
   (who may also be her brother!) due to a traumatic experience she had 
   long ago on her 16th birthday. She dispatches her unwanted visitors 
   and hides them in an old car in the barn. When her psychiatrist (Gene 
   Ross) threatens to commit her, Leslie chews on a combination of pills 
   and broken glass and dies. In the finale, we see Kevin (Chelsea Ross) 
   walking out of the house with a shovel in his hands muttering, 
   &quot;The least you could have done was bury them for me!&quot;. 
   While low on gore and nudity, this film has enough creepiness and 
   inventive visuals to keep you glued to the tube. What Brownrigg 
   lacked in finances, he more than made up for in placing his camera in 
   unusual locations. (i.e. When Leslie imagines Kevin making love to 
   her, the camera is Kevin's p.o.v.) Camilla Carr is excellent as

   Paul, &quot;Are you still going into town, Doctor? (<I>Pointing to 
   the four men in red hoods</I>) You see, that's how one gets greeted 
   in this village. Death rules here.&quot; He then asks Paul for 
   payment for the carriage ride, telling him he never goes into the 
   village, the outskirts is as far as he goes, because he is too 
   frightened to go any further. He only gave Paul a ride to the 
   outskirts because he needed the money. Paul pays him the money, the 
   coachman then saying, &quot;This place is cursed, forgotten by God. 
   Nobody ever comes to this place. Turn back, Doctor, before it's too 
   late.&quot; Paul ignores him, grabs his bags and enters the village 
   on foot. Paul is about to learn that the coachman was right; he is 
   about to experience things that medicine cannot explain. As a matter 
   of fact, things happen that common sense cannot explain. Deadly, 
   scary things.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While walking in the village, Paul asks a female villager where the 
   inn is and she points the way and hurriedly walks away. The village 
   is an ancient decaying mess, as Paul passes a wall adorned with 
   candles and crucifixes of all sizes, thinking it is strange. As he 
   comes across the inn, a scary-looking building whose front walls and 
   stone stairs are covered in a thick layer of green moss, Paul notices 
   two elderly gentlemen staring at him from an upper floor window of 
   the inn. When he enters the inn, everyone inside stops what they are 
   doing and stare at Paul, none of them moving a muscle, as if frozen 
   in place. Paul tells the Innkeeper (Giuseppe Addobbati; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#MonsterOpera1961/64">THE
    MONSTER OF THE OPERA</A></B> - 1961/1964) that he is here to see 
   Inspector Kruger (Piero Lulli; <B><A HREF="my_dear_killer_1972.htm">MY
    DEAR KILLER</A></B> - 1972) and the Innkeeper says, &quot;You are 
   the doctor, aren't you?&quot; Paul shakes his head yes and another 
   villager says, &quot;In this village, we never liked doctors.&quot; 
   Burgomeister Karl Keirr (Luciano Catenacci, as &quot;Max 
   Lawrence&quot;; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#SyndicateSadists75">SYNDICATE
    SADISTS</A></B> - 1975) appears and yells to the villager to be 
   quiet and tells Paul the Inspector has been waiting for him and 
   escorts him to the Inspector's temporary office in the inn. We then 
   see Inspector Kruger roughing-up a villager and when he tells the 
   Inspector he knows nothing about Irene Hollander, the Inspector 
   screams, &quot;You all have the same answer! Look, you can't fool 
   me!&quot;, grabbing the villager by the lapel of his jacket and 
   shaking him violently, finishing with, &quot;Why such resistance? 
   What keeps your tongue tied? Is it fear maybe? Fear from what? Tell 
   me! From what?&quot; He finds an amulet in the villager's jacket and 
   throws it to the ground, saying that superstition and ignorance is 
   what is keeping this village from talking (The villager quickly runs 
   to the amulet and picks it up, proving the the Inspector is correct 
   in his assumptions). Paul and Karl then enter the room, the Inspector 
   telling Paul he has been waiting a while for him to arrive, Paul 
   saying that he left immediately when the Inspector's message arrived, 
   but it wasn't easy to get to the village since no one wanted to take 
   him here. Karl says, &quot;We are isolated from the world here and 
   nobody ever comes to see us.&quot; Paul asks the Inspector if he 
   lives in this village and he says no, he arrived here a couple of 
   days ago and he asked Paul to come here for a very serious matter, 
   showing him a letter written by Irena Hollander, saying she's a woman 
   who worked as a housekeeper at a villa in this town, the villa of 
   Baroness Graps. The letter reads, <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;I can't 
   resist it anymore. I have decided to talk, to break the cycle of 
   death, a great burdon to me. Come soon, because this time if feels 
   like it is my turn. </FONT><FONT COLOR="MAROON">- Irena Hollander</FONT><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;</FONT></B> 
   The Inspector says the letter arrived at the police station, so he 
   decided to come here to find out what it is all about, but when he 
   arrived here, Irena Hollander was dead. Paul asks if it was a 
   homicide and the Inspector says he is not sure, but the villagers 
   want him to believe Irena's death was due to a curse. The Inspector 
   tells Paul he will have to decide if it was murder by performing an 
   autopsy on Irena Hollander's body. The Inspector is certain the 
   villagers know the truth, but they put up a wall of silence, as if 
   they are being terrorized by someone or something. He's hoping the 
   autopsy will lead them to the truth.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When the Inspector learns that the villagers are about to quickly 
   bury Irena to prevent an autopsy, he and Paul go to the cemetery and 
   stop two villagers from burying Irena's coffin. The villagers tell 
   the Inspector and Paul that an autopsy is forbidden; it's against the 
   law of nature to touch the dead. The Inspector orders them to move 
   Irena's body into the mortuary next to the cemetery so Paul can 
   perform an autopsy. Paul tells the Inspector that the law states that 
   he must have an independent witness, who has medical knowledge, to 
   watch him perform the autopsy. Until they find one, the autopsy 
   cannot be performed. Another villager comes into the cemetery to tell 
   the Inspector that Burgomeister Karl needs to talk to him 
   immediately, just as he was about to announce the name of Paul's 
   independent witness, but that will have to wait. When the Inspector 
   gets back to the inn, Karl tells him he tried to keep all the 
   witnesses in the inn, but when they heard that he and Paul were going 
   to the cemetery, they all left at the same time and there was nothing 
   he could do to stop them. But that's not the reason Karl called him 
   to the inn. He begs the Inspector to stop the autopsy, because 
   Irena's body should not be touched. The Inspector accuses Karl of 
   siding with the villagers, but Karl says no, the villagers won't talk 
   to him, not because they are hiding something, but out of fear. Karl 
   says he fears for his life, but somebody needs to reveal the secret 
   of Villa Graps. He tells the Inspector that he may not believe what 
   he is about to tell him, saying Irena Hollander's death wasn't an 
   accident, it was murder, but we don't hear what comes next as......</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The film then cuts to Paul in the mortuary, waiting for the 
   Inspector to arrive, but pretty Monica Schuftan (Erika Blanc; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DevilsNightmare1971">THE
    DEVIL'S NIGHTMARE</A></B> - 1971) walks inside, telling Paul that 
   the Inspector sent her to witness the autopsy. When Paul asks if she 
   has medical experience, she says she has never seen an autopsy being 
   performed, but she's a science student at a German university and 
   she's the closest thing to a doctor this village has. She also tells 
   Paul that she was born in this village, but this is the first time 
   she has been back here since she was a one-year-old toddler. When 
   sundown comes, we can see a young girl on a swing in the cemetery, 
   laughing, just outside the mortuary (pay close attention to the 
   &quot;swing-cam&quot; for an important visual clue). As Paul is 
   performing the autopsy, he discovers that someone has inserted a coin 
   into Irena's heart. &quot;Just like the legend&quot;, whispers 
   Monica, but Paul has no idea what she is talking about. &quot;It's an 
   old legend that has been circulating around here for centuries&quot;, 
   says Monica, continuing with, &quot;It says that only a coin in the 
   heart would bring peace to those whose lives have ended 
   violently.&quot; We then see a child's hand press up against the 
   window of the mortuary's front door, but neither Paul or Monica see 
   it. They are lucky they didn't.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After the autopsy is finished, Paul is unable to determine if 
   Irena's death was accidental or murder, telling Monica that Inspector 
   Kruger will have to discover that for himself. He walks Monica home 
   and it's<A HREF="kill_baby_kill_1966.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/kill baby kill germany poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="209" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   obvious Paul has developed romantic feelings for her, but he bids her 
   a goodnight and begins walking back to the inn to talk to the 
   Inspector. Suddenly, the two villagers from the cemetery attack Paul 
   for performing the autopsy. Just when it looks like Paul is about to 
   lose his life, Ruth (Fabienne Dali; <B><A HREF="desert_commandos_1967.htm">DESERT
    COMMANDOS</A></B> - 1967) appears out of the shadows and tells the 
   villagers to stop, which they do and run away quickly, as if scared 
   out of their wits. Ruth also disappears, leaving Paul very confused. 
   When he gets back to the inn, the Innkeeper's young daughter, 
   Nadienne (Micaela Esdra; <B><A HREF="black_ribbon_for_deborah_1974.htm">A
    BLACK RIBBON FOR DEBORAH</A></B> - 1974), tells Paul that Inspector 
   Kruger went to Villa Graps on an emergency, but he left Paul a 
   note.&nbsp; When Paul asks her when the Inspector will return 
   Nadienne blurts out, &quot;Nobody ever makes it back from Villa 
   Graps!&quot; Realizing what she has said, she apologizes to Paul, 
   saying, &quot;It's not true! I didn't say that! I didn't say 
   that!&quot;, telling Paul to go to his room right away, dinner is 
   ready. When Paul goes to his room, Nadienne bolts the door and locks 
   the windows and it's quite obvious by the look on her face that she's 
   scared to death.&nbsp; She then sees a young girl's pale face staring 
   at her through a window and she screams, yelling to the girl, 
   &quot;No! No! No! Not me!&nbsp; I didn't say anything! I didn't say a 
   thing!&quot; The Innkeeper and his wife, Martha (Franca Dominici), 
   come running and their daughter asks, &quot;At the window. Did you 
   see her?&quot; Martha instantly knows what has happened and tells her 
   husband, &quot;There is no hope!&quot; The Innkeeper says that only 
   Ruth can help them, so he quickly goes to leave the inn, only to find 
   Ruth standing outside the front door, saying, &quot;I could feel that 
   you need me.&quot; Just who is Ruth and why are all the villagers 
   scared of her, that is, unless they need her &quot;special talents&quot;?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   walks down the stairs and hears Ruth saying, &quot;The curse will not 
   touch you. Calm down girl. It won't happen to you.&quot; Paul looks 
   through a crack in the door and sees Ruth performing some type of 
   ritual while the Innkeeper and his family stand in the middle of the 
   room. Ruth tells Nadienne to get undressed after taking strands of 
   hair from her head, putting the hairs in a smoldering pot. Ruth 
   begins whipping Nadienne's naked back with a branch from a plant 
   until her back is bloody, while saying &quot;Stay away! You will not 
   curse this girl!&quot; Ruth then leaves by the back door and Paul 
   meets her outside, asking why she performed an exorcism on Nadienne. 
   Paul believes Ruth can help him solve Irena's death, asking her why 
   all the people in the village are afraid. &quot;There's a terrible 
   curse hovering over these people&quot;, replies Ruth, continuing 
   with, &quot;Be careful. You, too, are in danger. Irena Hollander was 
   thrown to her death.&quot; Paul asks, &quot;But by what?&quot; and 
   Ruth tells him to leave the village immediately, because &quot;those 
   are things that science cannot explain.&quot; She also says to Paul 
   to tell Inspector Kruger to leave with him, because his life is in 
   danger, too. Paul then walks to Villa Graps to meet the Inspector, 
   when Ruth won't tell him the meaning of the coin in the heart. When 
   Ruth gets home, we discover she and Burgomeister Karl are lovers, but 
   he's not there for lovemaking, he has brought her another dead 
   villager and says, &quot;Death rules at Villa Graps.&quot; Ruth tells 
   him it can be stopped only by Death itself and tells Karl to leave 
   and call a hearse right away. Dirt has to cover the body immediately 
   before the sun rises. Ruth then cuts the corpse open with a knife and 
   inserts a coin into its heart.&nbsp; What the hell kind of curse is this?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Paul arrives at Villa Graps&nbsp; and calls out for the Inspector, 
   but there is no answer. The entire rather large villa seems to be 
   empty, as Paul searches it room-by-room. He then meets the elderly 
   Baroness Graps (Giovanna Galletti, as &quot;Giana Vivaldi&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#GirlInRoom2A">GIRL
    IN ROOM 2A</A></B> - 1973) and she tells Paul that no police 
   inspector has come here, no one ever comes to Villa Graps willingly. 
   Paul then hears a faint moaning and before the Baroness slams the 
   door in his face, she says, &quot;Leave. It's for your own good!&quot;
    We then see a visibly scared Baroness Graps sit in a chair and stare 
   into a mirror, the windows in the room blowing open the curtains, the 
   wind sounding like a person wailing in pain. The Baroness says, 
   &quot;Leave me alone!&quot;, as the mirror begins distorting her 
   image and we hear a young girl laughing. As Paul is leaving the 
   villa, he sees the pale-faced young girl and asks her what her name 
   is. &quot;Melissa&quot; (played by &quot;Valerio Valeri&quot; but 
   more on him [yes, you read that right!] later), the young girl says, 
   as she darts away from Paul. He tries to follow her, but she keeps 
   disappearing and appearing anywhere she pleases. As Paul tries to 
   keep up with her, he misses a cobweb-filled portrait of a young girl 
   hanging on a wall, a plaque on the bottom reading <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;Melissa

   Innkeeper tells them that the wind isn't ringing the church bell, 
   it's the hatred. &quot;The bell is being moved by the hatred. It's 
   been that way since Melissa died twenty years ago without a drop of

   examines her, he discovers that her body is wrapped in barb wire! 
   Martha tells Paul that he doesn't understand, she was just trying to 
   protect her daughter from evil. The Innkeeper says his daughter is as 
   good as dead, nothing can save her. Paul tells him to shut up, 
   calling everyone in the village &quot;madmen&quot;, as he removes the 
   barb wire from Nadienne's body and cleans her wounds. Paul then finds 
   some notes in the Inspector's room that says all the weirdness in the 
   village began happening after the death of Melissa Graps twenty years 
   ago. Paul then finds Inspector Kruger dead in the cemetery, a bullet 
   hole in his right temple. Was it murder or was it suicide? That 
   answer comes quickly, as Melissa appears in Nadienne's bedroom and 
   makes her kill herself by forcing her to impale her throat on a 
   wall-mounted candle holder. It looks like Melissa made Inspector 
   Kruger kill himself by making him put a gun to his own head and

   if Monica ever returned to the village. Karl then tells Paul and 
   Monica that everyone's fate in this village is tied to Villa Graps. 
   Melissa then confronts Karl and makes him burn the sealed envelope.

    This horror film is Mario Bava's last Gothic chiller of the 1960's 
   and it has become a cult item for many obvious reasons. The 
   screenplay, by Bava and the writing team of Romano Migliorini &amp; 
   Roberto Natale, who both wrote the screenplays to the Gothic horror 
   flicks <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#TerrorCreatures1965">TERROR-CREATURES
    FROM THE GRAVE</A></B> (1965) and <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#BloodyPitHorror1965">BLOODY
    PIT OF HORROR</A></B> (1965), is creepy and goosebump-inducing, 
   especially when we see Melissa bounce her white ball, which means 
   someone is about to die. The cinematography, by Bava's longtime 
   photographer Antonio Rinaldi (who also shot Bava's <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#PlanetVampires1965">PLANET
    OF THE VAMPIRES</A></B> - 1965; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#FiveDolls1970">FIVE
    DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON</A></B> -1970; <B><A HREF="baron_blood_1972.htm">BARON
    BLOOD</A></B> - 1972, and a few others) is full of many 
   &quot;Bava-esque&quot; moments, including the aforementioned 
   &quot;Swing-cam&quot;, where we see Melissa's POV as she swings back 
   and forth, and the camera rotating in a circle as Monica runs down a 
   spiral staircase in Villa Graps, creating a dizzying effect for the 
   viewer. If the music score, by Carlo Rustichelli (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LongHairDeath1964">THE
    LONG HAIR OF DEATH</A></B> - 1964), sounds familiar, it's because 
   some of the passages were borrowed from Rustichelli's score to Bava's <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#BloodBlackLace1964">BLOOD
    AND BLACK LACE</A></B> (1964), done this way to save Bava some 
   money, as funding ran out two weeks into shooting and everyone agreed 
   to finish the film without being paid (Now that's loyalty!). Bava's 
   son, Lamberto Bava, who was Assistant Director <A HREF="kill_baby_kill_1966.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/kill baby kill italy poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="203" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>on

    AND THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1973 and several others) relays the story 
   (on the Kino Lorber DVD &amp; Blu-Ray) about how his father couldn't 
   find a young girl with the right look to play Melissa, but he saw a 
   young boy with the look he wanted, so he slapped a blond wig on him 
   and credited him under the unisex name &quot;Valerio Valeri&quot; 
   (not his real name; no one seems to remember what his real name 
   actually is!) to portray Melissa and it works magnificently, sending 
   shivers down viewers' spines, never realizing that they are actually 
   looking at a boy. I could go on and on about how great this film is, 
   from Bava's use of color to evoke chills (which I consider his 
   greatest talent), to the acting from everyone involved, but I will 
   leave that for you to discover. Bava was one of Italy's greatest 
   genre directors, as he could do anything (I recently watched his 
   pop-art crime film <B><A HREF="danger_diabolik_1968.htm">DANGER: DIABOLIK</A></B> 
   [1968] and enjoyed it immensely. Look for a review soon). Once you 
   watch this film, you will understand why. It is 83 minutes of pure,

    OF THEM</A></B> - 2003) and Jennifer (Ann Douglas), charter a boat 
   and head down river on some unnamed tropical island to check out 
   reports of illegal dumping polluting the waters. When they find 
   rusting barrels of radioactive waste leaking into the river, they 
   beat a hasty retreat to the nearest village, unaware that a 
   radiation-mutated crocodile is on their trail (We have already 
   witnessed the croc munching on two fishermen and a female swimmer 
   earlier in the film). The only law in the village is an elderly white 
   man called the Judge (Van Johnson; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Scorpion2Tails1982">THE
    SCORPION WITH TWO TAILS</A></B> - 1982) and he doesn't seem too

   surprise to find out that the Judge is being blackmailed by Jim Foley 
   (Wohrman Williams), the head of a chemical company doing the illegal 
   dumping, who has some information on the Judge's true identity and 
   threatens to expose him if he doesn't play ball. Kevin, Jennifer and 
   the team head back to the dumpsite to collect more evidence and 
   discover a half-eaten <A HREF="killer_crocodile_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/killer crocodile german dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>corpse
    of a local girl, which they bring back to the village for an 
   autopsy. The croc pays a brazen visit to the village and nearly eats 
   a young girl playing on a dock, but is saved by Kevin and crocodile 
   hunter Joe (Thomas Moore; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Light Blast">LIGHT BLAST</A></B> 
   - 1985). Kevin and the team set out to capture the croc alive, but 
   Joe goes out on his own to kill it. Kevin decides to follow Joe, so 
   he and his team jump in their boat and stay a safe distance behind 
   Joe, only to have their boat break down in the middle of the jungle. 
   They are forced to camp out on the banks of the river and the 
   super-intelligent croc separates the men from the women, dragging 
   Kevin and the male members into the middle of the river, sinking 
   their boat and chowing-down on team member Bob (John Harper). Joe 
   shows up and saves their lives, bringing the rest of the team to the 
   safety of his home in the middle of nowhere. Kevin quickly changes 
   his tune about capturing the croc alive and joins forces with Joe, 
   but they also have to deal with Foley and the Judge, who have placed 
   explosives at the dumpsite to get rid of the evidence. Again, the 
   croc proves to be smarter, as it makes a meal out of Foley and the 
   Judge and then turns it's attention to Kevin, who is armed only with 
   an outboard engine. The croc is force-fed the spinning propeller of 
   the outboard and then has it's head blown off when the engine 
   explodes. Don't worry, folks. A sequel followed the next year

   - 1981) giving her the old stinkeye and Kelly jokingly says, &quot;I 
   think he knows everything you did last Summer!&quot; (Hence the 
   DreadCentral blurb). Kelly doesn't like the water since her sister 
   drowned years ago (Lucy says to Alex, &quot;I don't think I have ever 
   seen her in the water.&quot;) and it is quite obvious that the flame 
   is rekindling between Lucy and Alex, since Alex noticed that Yasmin 
   treated Lucy like a bitch a short time earlier and didn't like what 
   he saw. We then see someone with a gaffer's hook killing a young guy 
   on the dock. What does one thing have to do with the other? Patience, 
   my dear readers. The next morning, Alex and the gang use his boat 
   (it's a very nice boat) to go sightseeing and take a look at the old 
   Army base (it is apparent that Kelly is nervous being on a boat), 
   which was built when the country was known as Yugoslavia. They meet 
   Yasmin's friend Boban (Dragan Micanovic), who Alex doesn't care for 
   since he's a little too handy with Yasmin. Once back at shore, Boban 
   suggests that everyone should actually go to the deserted military 
   base tomorrow to party, but when Niko hears Boban say that, he warns 
   everyone not to go there, since he lost six good men there a long 
   time ago and he can still hear their screams. He also believes 
   something evil surrounds that base and advises them, &quot;Just go 
   somewhere else.&quot; Of course, since this is a horror film, they 
   ignore Niko's advice and take the boat there the next morning, but 
   they cannot dock because the island is surrounded by jagged rocks, so 
   they must swim about 20 yards to get to shore. This worries Kelly, 
   but Boban lets her hold him tight while he swims to shore (and a 
   little romantic heat happens between the two). Since they are on an 
   unoccupied island, there is no cell phone service and they all see an 
   imposing stranger (Miodrag Krstovic; billed in the credits as 
   &quot;The Guardian&quot;) dropping bloody human parts from a metal 
   pail into a well. When The Guardian leaves, Lucy takes a photo down 
   the well and a woman shows up on her camera phone, but The Guardian 
   spots them and begins to fire his shotgun their way. They run to the 
   boat, only to find it gone, so Boban tries to grab the shotgun away 
   from The Guardian, only to get seriously cut on the leg with a knife. 
   Boban tells everyone else to run away, while he plays a cat-and-mouse 
   game with The Guardian. Boban avoids him and rejoins Kelly and 
   Yasmin, but they have lost track of Lucy and Alex. Alex hears 
   strange, beautiful singing (the women can't hear it) and he becomes 
   obsessed with meeting the woman in the well (He is so obsessed, he 
   tells Lucy, &quot;Get out of here, bitch!&quot;). Boban and the other 
   two girls discover a room with a bloody bathtub in the middle and the 
   walls are plastered with newspaper articles of missing people dating 
   back to World War II. They also find an old photo of The Guardian 
   with Niko and they are both wearing military uniforms. Lucy joins the 
   rest of the group and she tells them that Alex has found the mystery 
   woman, so they go off to find him, not noticing that The Guardian has 
   grabbed Yasmin, killed her with the gaffer's hook, put her in the 
   bathtub and begins to decapitate her with an axe (It takes him at 
   least ten swings with the axe to remove her head from her body, which 
   impressed me, because it is virtually impossible to decapitate a 
   person with a single swing of an axe, like you see in a lot of horror 
   films. The neck contains a lot of tough muscles.). When Boban and the 
   two American girls backtrack to find Yasmin, they see The Guardian 
   hack off her head and throw it on the floor. Boban hears the 
   beautiful singing and becomes obsessed in finding out where it is 
   coming from and it takes a slap in the face by Kelly to snap him out 
   of it. They discover that the beautiful woman they saw in the well is 
   actually a mermaid (it comes as no surprise considering the give-away 
   title of the film), as Boban fights for his life against The 
   Guardian. Lucy and Kelly then spot Alex's headless body floating in 
   the water, while the beautiful mermaid (Zorana Kostic Obradovic) 
   transforms into a hideous creature (Mina Sablic). Lucy falls in the 
   water and is killed by the creature, while Boban has one of his hands 
   impaled by the gaffer's hook, but he plants the axe into The 
   Guardian's back and kills him. Or so he thinks. The mermaid lets out 
   a god-awful scream, which brings The Guardian back to life (she needs 
   someone to feed her human bodies when she can't find them herself) 
   and he chases Boban and Kelly through the bunker's labyrinth of 
   narrow tunnels and they barely escape with their lives by making it 
   through a metal door that leads outside. Niko is on the other side of 
   the door and he tells them to get in his rowboat if they want to 
   live. It turns out that Niko is <A HREF="nymph_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/nymph 2014 aka killer mermaid poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>the
    hero if this movie, as he tells the story of the killer mermaid 
   while he rows back to the mainland. It turns out this mermaid is 
   actually one of the &quot;Sirens&quot; of Greek mythology (Niko says 
   the legend got one of the islands wrong, because the island that the 
   bunker was built on is one of the three islands occupied by a 
   Siren.). He and his men discovered the mermaid when they were 
   building the base in the 1940's, but his six friends were murdered by 
   the mermaid and The Guardian once use to be his friend until the 
   mermaid took him over and made him her slave. His ex-friend then 
   began killing tourists and residents to feed the Siren's hunger (I 
   mean, how could you tell the authorities such an outrageous story 
   without being thrown in a mental institution?). While Niko is just a 
   few yards from the mainland, the mermaid attacks, knocks Boban off 
   the boat and drags him down the water to his doom. Niko impales the 
   mermaid with a speargun with a line attached to it while Kelly gets 
   over her fear of the water, jumps in and tows the boat to shore. The 
   mermaid then appears again and Kelly pulls the speargun line and 
   drags her to shore away from the water, while Niko throws a net 
   around her so she can't crawl back into the water. Nico nearly falls 
   under the mermaid's spell when she starts to sing, but Kelly snaps 
   him out of it (she should take a job where all she does is slap men 
   in the face) and Niko stabs her to death with a multi-pronged fishing 
   spear. The Guardian holds his dead mermaid's body in his arms, when 
   Niko realizes that the Siren's two sisters are leaving their islands 
   thousands of miles away to come to Rose for retribution. Nico knows 
   that everyone in the beautiful seaside village will soon meet their 
   doom, so he creates the first victim by impaling The Guardian's head 
   with the gaffer's hook and then just waits for the inevitable to 
   happen. The film ends on this ominous note, but who knows, maybe 
   there will be a sequel?&nbsp; Director Milan Todorovic, who

   (1958), where the Sirens' yells force Sinbad's mutinous crew to crash 
   their boats. While this film plays fast and loose with the mythology, 
   there is plenty of topless nudity (the very first shot is of a 
   topless woman), girls in bikinis and bloody gore to keep your eyes 
   occupied. Besides, you get to see Franco Nero in a horror film (it's 
   not just a cameo) and, except him and the two American actresses, 
   nearly everyone's last names end with an &quot;ic&quot;, although 
   they all speak perfectly understandable English. The on-location 
   photography and the real deserted Army base add immensely to the 
   atmosphere. Nothing spectacular, but a good way to spend 96 minutes.

   very good CGI effects, otherwise all the other gore is done

   pincher), a busload of young schoolgirls on their way to a music 
   competition are stranded in the same area when their bus breaks down 
   and they are forced to take refuge in a secluded hotel that is closed 
   for repairs. The killings start when the bus driver has an axe 
   planted in his neck as he walks through the woods after escorting the 
   girls and their two dowager chaperones to the hotel. After cutting 
   the phone lines, the four psychos begin killing the occupants of the 
   hotel (one of them also cuts the tail off some poor cat), while 
   visiting campers Pete (Anthony Forrest) and Mike (Tom Marshall), 
   along with local girl Julie (Jayne Hayden) and schoolgirl Agatha 
   (Georgina Kean) try to get help. Thinking that all this is a shared 
   dream, the psychos begin raping the schoolgirls, killing the 
   chaperones and terrorizing the other schoolgirls who have locked 
   themselves in their rooms. The psychos threaten to kill classmate 
   Mary (Jo-Anne Good) if the other girls don't unlock their doors and 
   come out. The girls relent and then are forced to, God forbid, cook 
   for them. After having a close call with one of the loonies, Pete is 
   able to smuggle two girls out of the hotel, but one of them is choked 
   to death while trying to get away. The finale finds the remaining 
   schoolgirls (and the three-legged dog) turning on their attackers. It 
   also seems that the psychos didn't pick this hotel at random, as one 
   of them has a connection to it and the secret is located in a room in 
   the basement.&nbsp; This is strictly by-the-numbers horror film 
   stuff, directed/scripted/co-produced without much imagination by Alan 
   Birkinshaw (<B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Invaders Lost Gold">INVADERS
    OF THE LOST GOLD</A></B> - 1981; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Masque Red Death 89">MASQUE
    OF THE RED DEATH</A></B> - 1989). I'm sure Birkinshaw's idea was to 
   make this film a black comedy, but the broad overacting by the 
   quartet of actors playing the psychos (David Jackson, Nigel Gregory, 
   Paul Rattee and Peter Spraggen) just make the whole film seem rather 
   silly and not very funny or frightening. While I will admit that the 
   idea of the psychos believing that they are in a dream sounded 
   intriguing, Birkinshaw's script fails to deliver on the premise more 
   often than not. The closest it comes to hitting the mark is when one 
   of the inmates stops another from killing one of the schoolgirls by 
   remarking, &quot;What if it's one of the nurses and we're still in 
   the hospital?&quot;, or another one questioning whether he should 
   have chosen Britain's National Health Care by saying, &quot;I should 
   have gone private!&quot; Most of the time, though, they just say 
   innoculous crap like, &quot;I'm confused. Am I in your dream or are 
   you in mine?&quot;. Birkinshaw does throw in a lot of nudity by the 
   young cast (although it is rather obvious they are too old to be 
   schoolgirls), some pretty decent gore (a throat slashing, an axe 
   murder, a sickle attack) and I liked the scene of the three-legged 
   dog (played by a real three-legged dog) getting even on it's attacker 
   by ripping out his throat, but nearly 80% of the film is a 
   languidly-paced talky horror flick with not much to recommend. I can 
   only surmise that Birkinshaw was trying to make a horror film in the 
   vein of director Pete Walker (<B><A HREF="frightmare_1974.htm">FRIGHTMARE</A></B>

    KILLER SNAKES</A><A NAME="KillerSnakes"></A> (1974) -</B> This sick 
   and sadistic Hong Kong horror film is certainly an eye-opener, if 
   only for the way it depicts sex as acts of violence. The story is 
   about Zhihong (Kan Kuo Liang, aka &quot;Kurt Lang&quot;), a sexual 
   deviant-in-the-making, whose only real friends are snakes and 
   lizards. Ever since he was a young boy, Zhihong has associated sex 
   with pain, thanks to his whore mother, who could only <A HREF="killer_snakes_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/killer snakes dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="162" HEIGHT="226" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>reach
    orgasm if she was whipped or beaten. Now a grown man, Zhihong is a 
   loner who gets picked on by nearly everyone he meets and he 
   masturbates to bondage photos he has taped to walls of the shack he 
   lives in. He gets a job as a delivery boy at a restaurant and one day 
   an injured cobra appears in his room. The snake's gall bladder has 
   been removed (the liquid in the bladders are considered a sexual 
   delicacy), so Zhihong stitches him up and nurses him back to health. 
   They become friends, Zhihong names him &quot;Xiaobiao&quot; (I'm sure 
   that has some significance in Chinese) and, pretty soon, more injured 
   snakes and lizards visit Zhihong to be healed. It's not long before 
   Zhihong has an army of reptiles at his disposal, willing to do 
   anything he commands. Zhihong is repeatedly attacked and humiliated 
   by street thugs and prostitutes (One street gang strips him naked and 
   steals all his money he had hidden in his sneaker) and he is getting 
   sick and tired of it, so he decides to use the snakes as tools of 
   revenge. When he visits a whorehouse, a hooker and some street toughs 
   follow him out of the whorehouse and try to steal his money, but 
   Xiaobiao is hidden in his pocket. The cobra bites and kills all the 
   guys and Zhihong brings the unconscious hooker back to his shack, 
   ties her up, has bondage sex with her and then (in a scene sure to 
   make even the most jaded viewer squirm) lets a snake crawl up her 
   vagina while other snakes sink their fangs into her naked body, with 
   Zhihong screaming, &quot;Bite her!&quot; over and over. The next to 
   suffer the wrath of the snakes is Zhihong's bullying boss, who is 
   always docking his pay for inconsequential things. Zhihong then 
   brings a masochistic prostitute back to his shack, ties her up (a 
   recurring theme), beats her and then lets some giant lizards make a 
   meal out of her. After seeing his only human friend turn into a 
   prostitute and a drug addict, Zhihong does the only thing his twisted 
   mind will allow him to do. After one more bit of bloody revenge, 
   Zhihong decides that all his slithery friends are better off dead, so 
   he puts them in cardboard boxes, douses them in gasoline and sets 
   them aflame. Bad move. He should have realized that snakes are 
   resiliant creatures and don't like to be double-crossed. They pay 
   Zhihong a final visit and the last time we see him, he's covered from 
   head-to-toe in live snake and lizardwear. Insert screams here.&nbsp; 
   This sexually-charged <B><A HREF="willard_1971.htm">WILLARD</A></B> 
   (1971) rip-off (a Shaw Brothers Production) is truly an endurance 
   test for those who are squeamish about snakes or real-life animal

    BOXER'S OMEN</A></B> - 1983) and screenwriter I. Kuang depict sex as 
   a dirty, unnatural and painful act, especially through the eyes and 
   imagination of the emotionally-scarred Zhihong. Although there is 
   plenty of nudity and sex shown (much more than most Hong Kong 
   features at the time), nearly every time it is depicted, someone is 
   getting humiliated, hurt or killed. There are very few likable 
   characters here; even the much put-upon Zhihong is shown to be a 
   sexual deviant who can't ejaculate without fantasizing about women 
   being tied-up or beaten. When he visits the whorehouse, his entire 
   time of having sex with the hooker is about thirty seconds shy of a 
   minute. He spends much more time with her once she is bound-up with 
   rope in his shack. The closest thing to a sympathetic character here 
   is the female Xiujuan, who actually feels sorry for Zhihong. He blows 
   it with her when she catches him masturbating to bondage photos in a 
   magazine. After he is caught, the only thing he can do is commit 
   violence, so he destroys her cart where she sold toys on the street. 
   When her father dies, she is forced to become a hooker and, 
   eventually, a drug addict to pay her family's bills. She ends up 
   getting anally raped by a man in a hotel room and when Zhihong sees 
   her naked and passed out on the bed (he's a peeping tom, too), he 
   breaks a window, enters her room and has Xiaobiao bite her because 
   she's &quot;better off dead than being a prostitute&quot;. A pretty 
   grim take on life brought on, no doubt, by his upbringing. It's 
   apparent that during the many snake attack scenes (the best being the 
   attack on Xiujuan's rapist, where many real snakes are cut in half 
   with a sword) that people were actually bitten, making this both a 
   physically and psychologically graphic experience. This is grim 
   stuff, so forget about a feel-good experience here. When <B><A HREF="killer_snakes_1974d.htm">THE

   affair with every man in town after reading what he thinks is her

    ON DEATH'S DOOR</A><A NAME="KnockingDeathsDoor"></A> (1998) -</B> A 
   newlywed couple, Brad (Brian Bloom), a parapsychologist, and Danielle 
   (Kimberly Rowe), a medium, are sent to check out a haunted house by 
   their devious boss, Professor Ballard (musician John Doe). As soon as 
   they move in, Brad is knocked unconscious by a flying lamp while a 
   fireplace poker sails through the air, the room turns cold and 
   candles blow out by themselves. The next day, they set up their 
   scientific instruments and for a month they experience no paranormal 
   activity. When they go for a night out on the town, things go badly. 
   A guy in a bar hits on Danielle and the extremely jealous Brad (who 
   doesn't trust his new wife since he caught her having an affair with 
   Professor Ballard shortly before they were married) decks the guy 
   with a beer bottle to the head. When they get home and argue, 
   Danielle passes out and later goes to town sawbones Doc Hadley (David 
   Carradine), who shows an unusual interest into why she and her 
   husband have moved into the &quot;Sunset Place&quot;. Doc Hadley also 
   informs Danielle<A HREF="knocking_on_deaths_door_1998.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/knocking on death's door dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="153" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   that she is pregnant. Danielle tries to contact the spirit that is 
   haunting the house and it reveals itself to be &quot;Samuel&quot; (it 
   writes it's name in chalk on the basement floor). Danielle thinks 
   that two spirits are haunting the house and one of them is very 
   unfriendly (it tries to kill Bard by dropping a grandfather clock on 
   him, just as he's about to get busy with his wife). Both Brad and 
   Danielle come to the conclusion that one spirit seems to reveal 
   itself when sex or anger is involved and Brad seems to be the one 
   that gets hurt when he argues or tries to have sex with Danielle. 
   Brad thinks that Samuel wants Danielle for himself. The problem is 
   that there are two Samuels haunting this house: Samuel Sr. (Michael 
   McCabe), who died in a car fire, and his son, Samuel Jr. (Brian 
   Glanney), whose death is a mystery. Danielle must unlock the mystery 
   and lay Samuel Jr. to rest by finding out where his murderer buried 
   him. When Doc Hadley reveals his true identity (he was the illicit 
   lover of Samuel Jr.'s mother, who was responsible for both Samuel Sr. 
   &amp; Jr.'s deaths), he tries killing Danielle, but Samuel Jr. comes 
   to both Brad and Danielle's aide and kills Doc Hadley in a fiery car 
   crash.&nbsp; Add one part <B><A HREF="legend_of_hell_house_1973.htm">THE
    LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE</A></B> (1973), mix in some themes from <B><A HREF="dead_zone_1984.htm">THE
    DEAD ZONE</A></B> (1984), sprinkle in a murder mystery and toss in 
   some sex scenes and what you get is a pretty ordinary, if somewhat 
   atmospheric, haunted house thriller with a few creepy scenes. 
   Director Mitch Marcus, who also made another haunted house film right 
   after this one (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HauntingHellHouse98">THE 
   HAUNTING OF HELL HOUSE</A></B>) using the same sets and locations 
   (filmed in Ireland), gives us a couple of goosebump-inducing scenes 
   (Danielle playing &quot;London Bridge Is Falling Down&quot; on the 
   piano and discovering the ghost of Samuel Jr. is sitting beside her 
   when she looks in the mirror; The seance where Samuel Sr. comes out 
   of the wall in a flash of bright light and hovers near Danielle's 
   face), but much of the film seems like filler and there's some 
   unnecessarily sloppy plot holes (script by Craig J. Nevius) that 
   deters the viewer from truly enjoying this (The major one being why 
   Brad would work for such an asshole lech like Professor Ballard, when 
   it's plain to see he still has the hots for his wife). While this is 
   not a violent or bloody film (there's an axe murder in the beginning 
   prologue, but nothing too graphic afterward), it does have it's share 
   of chills (thanks mainly to Brian Glanney's creepy sudden appearances 
   as Samuel Jr.) and some welcome nudity from Kimberly Rowe (some of it 
   looks to have been done by a body double). Too bad there's not enough 
   meat in the plot to sustain it. That, and Brian Bloom tries way too 
   hard playing the jealous husband. Half the time I thought he was 
   possessed by a spirit, when he actually wasn't. Made for Executive 
   Producer Roger Corman's New Concorde Productions, but it's not as 
   cheap looking as most of Corman's productions at the time, thanks to 
   the on-location photography. Also starring Brendan Costello, Stella 
   Freehilly, Stuart Dunne, Freda Hand, Caroline Rothwell and a cameo by 
   William Hickey (his last film). A New Horizons Home Video Release. <B>Rated

   door.&quot; &quot;Pound through the door who?&quot; &quot;Pound 
   through the door and rip your head off, you Catholic bastard!&quot; 
   There, I've just given you the basic plot of this very uneven, but 
   gory, slasher film. Someone is killing members of the Glass County 
   High football team, including members of the cheerleading squad. The 
   first one to die is Jerome Peters (Damion Lee). There is a knock at 
   his mother's door and when she opens it, she finds Jerome dead, 
   pinned to the door like Christ on the cross, with icepicks sticking 
   through his mouth arms and chest (I'm detecting some Catholic guilt 
   going on here). Detective Billie Vega (Kim Taggart) is assigned to 
   the case and has a run-in with Mike (Antonio Mastrantonio), an ex-cop 
   who has returned to town to try and reconnect with his granddaughter, 
   Nikki Reynolds (Joli Julianna), who just happens to be a member of 
   the cheerleading squad. Nikki would rather her grandfather just 
   disappear from her life again, but something tells me that she will 
   soon welcome his presence. Nikki keeps seeing this huge guy with a 
   burned face following her, but her friends think she is just seeing 
   things or it's her grandpa keeping tabs on her. Detective Vega and <A HREF="knock_knock_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/knock knock dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="206" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Sheriff
    Cutter (Anthony Palladino) go to the house of Mrs. Olen (Susan 
   Lehman) and her mentally handicapped son, Troy (Sal Sirchia), one of 
   the school's janitors, to ask him some questions because members of 
   the cheerleading squad don't like the way he looks at them (Hell, you 
   don't have to be retarded to stare at pretty girls in tight uniforms, 
   do you?). All Troy says over-and-over is, &quot;Please don't let them 
   take me away!&quot;, so Vega and Cutter leave. They should have 
   stayed long enough to discover that Troy keeps a bunch of Barbie 
   dolls dressed in cheerleader uniforms in a metal box and one of them 
   has a photo of Nikki's face glued on it! The next to die is Julie 
   (Katherine Castaneda), who is crucified at her father's auto garage 
   (The killer pounds a screwdriver through her temple, positions her 
   body on the car lift and then burns her stomach in graphic detail 
   with a acetylene torch), so it's the first thing her father sees when 
   he looks through the garage door (More religious imagery). The town 
   issues a curfew for the teens, but the killer manages to do some 
   killings during the day, murdering football player Shawn (Jeremy 
   Drew) by impaling him through the chest with a mop handle at the high 
   school locker room. The killer then cuts off one of Shawn's legs with 
   a hacksaw, disembowels him with his bare hands and leaves his body in 
   his father's locker (Shawn's dad is also a school janitor), with the 
   words &quot;Knock Knock&quot; written in Shawn's blood on the locker 
   door. When Dad opens the door, he finds Shawn's body has been sawed 
   into little pieces. It becomes apparent to the viewer that all these 
   killings were meant to punish the parents, but who caused these 
   killings and what is the reason? Troy is immediately arrested, but 
   that is way too easy, isn't it? Mike delves deeper ionto the killings 
   and discovers that it may have something to do with the town's 
   deranged former undertaker and his kids, Rico (Lou Savarese) and 
   Rachel (Stephanie Finochio). In case you haven't guessed, all the 
   dead kids' parents were members of the 1990 Glass County High 
   football team and some of them locked Rico in one of his father's 
   caskets as a practical joke, accidentally setting the place on fire 
   and permanently disfiguring Rico, who was sent to an insane asylum. 
   Well, he's out and when Mike learns that his son was also a member of 
   that football team (Wait. Why didn't he know that?), he races to save 
   Nikki before it is too late.&nbsp; Director/producer/screenwriter 
   Joseph Ariola (<B><A HREF="coalition_2004.htm">COALITION</A></B> - 
   2004) sure ladles on the gore thick and heavy (it's all very well 
   done by effects artist Tate Steinsiek) and tries to keep the mystery 
   fresh as the film progresses, but the sad fact is that there are so 
   many untalented Italian-American actors on view, you'll think you're 
   at the Jersey Shore during the middle of July. It's like watching an 
   episode of <B><A HREF="sopranos_tv.htm">THE SOPRANOS</A></B> 
   performed by the staff and students of Fuhgettaboutit High. In 
   between plenty of &quot;deese&quot; and &quot;doose&quot; though, 
   there are a lot of grisly deaths, all pushing the boundaries of good 
   taste. There is so much unrated neck slashings, disembowelments, 
   stabbings, dismemberment, beheadings and bone snappings, you'll think 
   you're back in the 80's heyday of gore. Director Ariola (I bet he got 
   teased a lot in school) also tosses in some prime female nudity, 
   including a rather painful death in a shower. If it's gore you are 
   after, you can't do much better than <B><A HREF="knock_knock_2006b.htm">KNOCK

   students suffer the bloodiest deaths). Also starring John Cipriano

    BLOOD</A></B> - 1972; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Screamers1980">SCREAMERS</A></B> 
   - 1980) is up to his old tricks again. He's paying grave robber Lynch 
   (Herbert Fux; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#MarkOfTheDevil1970">MARK
    OF THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1970) to supply him with a steady stream of 
   corpses so he can create the first man-made man. When the Baron's 
   daughter, Tania (Rosalba Neri, here using the name &quot;Sara 
   Bay&quot;), returns from medical school a full-fledged surgeon, she 
   confronts her father about his experiments. It seems she has known 
   about her father's secret experiments with human body parts ever 
   since she was a child, but instead of being mad at him, she wants to 
   join him in creating the perfect human being (it seems she went to 
   medical school just so she could gain her father's approval). The 
   Baron needs the corpse of someone dead less than six hours, so Lynch 
   steals the body of a man that was just hanged (Both the Baron and 
   Tania watch the hanging and it is clear that she was sexually 
   turned-on in watching it). As the Baron is performing his latest body 
   part transplants, Tania suddenly appears and likes what she sees 
   (again, she gets sexually excited viewing the monster's body, even 
   running her fingers across the creature's open incisions!). As a 
   large lightning storm approaches, the Baron sees this as the perfect 
   opportunity to transplant a heart and brain into the creature's body 
   and bring it to life. The Baron's <A HREF="lady_frankenstein_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/lady frankenstein poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="185" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>assistant,
    Charles (Paul Muller), notices the brain is damaged, but with the 
   lightning storm rapidly approaching and no other brain available, The 
   Baron decides to use the brain and finish the reanimation. You just 
   know this isn't going to end well. When the creature is struck by 
   lightning, it catches on fire, horribly scarring it's face. The 
   creature does come to life, though, and while Charles rushes to get 
   Tania to witness her father's triumph, the creature crushes the Baron 
   to death in it's arms and escapes from the laboratory. Tania uses her 
   womanly charms on Charles, having him report her father's death to 
   Police Captain Harris (Mickey Hargitay; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Delirium1972">DELIRIUM</A></B> 
   - 1972) as a murder by an intruder. Captain Harris has a hard time 
   believing Charles' story, as the creature begins laying a path of 
   death and destruction on his way into town (he kills a nude girl 
   making love to her boyfriend in a field and snaps the necks of some 
   locals who try to intervene). The villagers take up arms when tales 
   of the monster begin to circulate, while Tania and Charles create 
   another creature to be used as an &quot;executioner&quot; to the 
   first creature. They decide to use the body of retarded, hulking 
   handyman Thomas (Marino Mase) and Charles' brain (!) to create the 
   new creature (Tania marries Charles and then has sex with him, using 
   her body as a means to get Charles to give up his brain). Things go 
   south when Thomas' sister comes looking for him, Captain Harris 
   discovers the truth and the first creature returns to the castle to 
   do battle with the Thomas/Charles creature (which Tania uses as a sex 
   toy!). As the creatures battle each other (and, once again, Tania 
   watches completely turned-on), the castle catches fire when 
   torch-bearing villagers (are there any other kind?) break in and 
   destroy the place. As the castle burns around them, Tania and the 
   Thomas/Charles creature make love one final time, the creature 
   strangling Tania with his bare hands while she reaches orgasm. Tania 
   finally experiences the sex/death connection she so desperately 
   wanted.&nbsp; Previously released in a severely-edited 83 minute 
   print, I finally got to view a composite print which restores all the 
   footage excised from most prints. While it is not a better film in 
   this incarnation by any stretch of the imagination, it is a far 
   sexier film as all the full-frontal nudity is reinstated. Even though 
   it's nice to finally see all the missing nudity, this is still a 
   clunky affair. Director Mel Welles (<B><A HREF="#ManeaterOfHydra">MANEATER
    OF HYDRA</A></B> - 1966) has made an endlessly talky film that takes 
   forever to get moving. While it's always great to see Rosalba Neri (<B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Amuck1971">AMUCK</A></B> 
   - 1971; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#FrenchSexMurders">FRENCH SEX MURDERS</A></B> 
   - 1972) naked, the sad fact is that this film lacks pacing, 
   atmosphere and the creature's appearance elicits laughs rather than 
   fright. The lack of any substantial gore (most of the creature's 
   kills are simple neck-snappings) also hurts the film. Since this film 
   fell into the public domain years ago, there have been many versions 
   available on home video, mostly crappy EP-mode VHS tapes and 
   low-bitrate budget DVDs. Even in unedited form, it's bound not to win 
   any new fans because, let's face it, crap is crap no matter how much 
   nudity is in it. Only for fans of Rosalba Neri and people with a lot 
   of time on their hands. Also starring Renata Cash, Lawrence Tilden,

   nameless girl (co-producer Bobbi Sue Luther) wakes up locked in a 
   coffin in a funeral parlor. She breaks out of her mini-prison and 
   dials 911 on the wall phone, but before the police can run a trace, 
   she stupidly breaks the phone cord by stretching it out until it

   The girl, who has no memory of who she is or how she got into this

   side of the road by Tucker (Kevin Gage; <B><A HREF="strangeland_1998.htm">STRANGELAND</A></B>

    given why he does this) and watches homemade torture videos on a 
   handheld device. Chrome Skull kills Cindy (a nasty scene where he 
   rams his specially-made knife into Cindy's skull and twists the 
   blade) and records her death (he has a video camera attached to his 
   shoulder) in front of Tucker and the girl, who he has nicknamed 
   &quot;Princess&quot;. Tucker and Princess escape into the night in 
   Tucker's truck, but they fail to notice Cindy's brother, Johnny (a 
   cameo by Johnathon Schaech; <B><A HREF="prom_night_2008.htm">PROM NIGHT</A></B> 
   - 2008) and his girlfriend Jamie (Jana Kramer) pulling-up to the 
   house. Johnny thinks Tucker is cheating on his sister (he saw him 
   pick up Princess from the side of the road earlier) and has come to 
   confront Tucker. Johnny will confront Chrome Skull instead, who 
   cuts-off Johnny's face with his knife (you have to see it to believe 
   it) and slices Jamie in the stomach until her intestines fall out. 
   Tucker and Princess drive to the nearest home in search of a phone 
   and end up at the residence of Steven (Sean Whalen; <B><A HREF="python_2000.htm">PYTHON</A></B> 
   - 2000), who doesn't have a phone, but he sends an email to the 
   police station from his computer. While Princess is cleaning-up in 
   the bathroom, Steven and Tucker do a search on the internet on the 
   killer and find information on both Chrome Skull and Princess (which 
   the audience is not yet let in on). The trio drives to the police 
   station, only to find all the cops dead and Chrome Skull waiting for 
   them. They manage to escape and end up back at the Jones Funeral 
   Home, where Princess hopes to find the answers to her true identity. 
   Princess ends up locked inside another coffin, but Tucker and Steven 
   save her after shooting Chrome Skull and discovering a barn full of 
   coffins containing the dismembered body parts of Chrome Skull's 
   previous victims. They steal Chrome Skull's car and video camera, 
   where Princess learns more about her true identity. She steals Chrome 
   Skull's car and leaves Tucker and Steven behind, unaware that Chrome 
   Skull is still very much alive and in control of the car. What 
   happens next is best left for the audience to discover for 
   themselves. Let's just say that Princess wasn't one of society's best 
   citizens before she lost her memory.&nbsp; This horror tale, directed 
   and written by Robert Hall (<B><A HREF="lightning_bug_2004.htm">LIGHTNING
    BUG</A></B> - 2004), is effective due to it's fractured narrative 
   and dreamlike quality. Things, very graphic things, happen 
   matter-of-factly throughout the film seemingly without rhyme or 
   reason, but as the film progresses, it's clear that something 
   important is about to happen to tie all the loose ends together. And 
   then it doesn't. <B><A HREF="laid_to_rest_2009b.htm">LAID TO REST</A></B> 
   leaves many questions unanswered (particularly about Chrome Skull and 
   his motives), but it is not a film for the faint of heart, as the 
   makeup effects, usually involving the damage Chrome Skull does with 
   his huge, chrome-plated serrated knife&nbsp; (although there is a 
   creative kill involving a can of Fix-A-Flat), are as grisly and 
   graphic as you will ever see on film. Yet it is the film's hopeless 
   tone, achieved through draining the color photography (the majority 
   of it filmed in Maryland during the dead of night), ethereal acting 
   (both Sean Whalen and Kevin Gage register here; one as a man who has 
   just lost his mother and is scared to death of death and one as a 
   semi-cripple who tries to make sense of everything that's happening 
   around him, including the vicious killing of his loving wife) and a 
   haunting music score that sets this film apart from most modern DTV 
   horror. This film isn't perfect, as the story takes a few fatal 
   missteps (especially in the final third), but it's still better than

   There's also a subplot about a news crew who lure the shark to get 
   the &quot;story of the year&quot;. It doesn't end too well for 
   them.&nbsp; Director Enzo G. Castellari (<B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Nine90BronxWar1982">1990:

   the screen is routine and boring, especially the shark attacks. 
   Nevermind that the shark model is laughable (it's no Bruce), the 
   whole film is rather bloodless (except for the scenes where the Mayor 
   gets bitten in half while hanging from a helicopter and a news 
   cameraman also meets a similar fate), something I find unforgivable 
   in an Italian rip-off. As a matter of fact, <B>JAWS</B> is much 
   bloodier than this. If you're not going to up the gore quotient, why 
   make the film in the first place? Believe me when I say that the 
   American audiences didn't miss much when it was banned. Also starring 
   Timothy Brent, Micky Pignatelli, Stefania Girolami and Max Vanders.

    THE BEGINNING</A></B> (1988). Other times, he turned out 
   insufferable films that, even if you had the patience of a saint, 
   seemed like you were spending an eternity in Hell. <B>LEGACY OF HORROR</B> 
   is one of those films. This is nothing but a more impoverished (if 
   you can believe that) verbatim remake of his own <B><A HREF="ghastly_ones_1968.htm">THE
    GHASTLY ONES</A></B> (1968), which was nothing but a standard 
   &quot;reading of the will&quot; horror flick. In the early Twentieth 
   Century, the three married Handley sisters are called to New York by 
   a law firm and told that their deceased wealthy father (who was 
   somewhat of a bastard) has left them a fortune. There is one caveat, 
   however. In order to collect their inheritance, all three sisters 
   (and their husbands) must spend three days and nights at their 
   father's remote island mansion living in &quot;sexual harmony&quot; 
   (whatever that means). Also at the mansion are two spinster sisters 
   who are the caretakers. They live there with their severely retarded 
   brother, who's only friend is his pet white rabbit. When at the 
   mansion, the Handley sisters discover <A HREF="legacy_of_horror_1979.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/legacy of horror vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>that
    the only time their father spent any time there was to get their 
   mother pregnant (all three sisters were born at the mansion). One of 
   the sisters finds the white rabbit gutted in her bed, with a note 
   that says, &quot;And the meek shall inherit&quot;. Someone dressed 
   all in black then murders the Handley sisters' husbands, by hanging, 
   tree saw and pitchfork (a Milligan trademark). The 
   &quot;surprise&quot; ending reveals that the spinster sisters and 
   their retarded brother are also Papa Handley's kids, and one of them 
   wants the inheritance for themselves.&nbsp; As with most Milligan 
   productions, this film is extremely talky and nothing really happens 
   through the film's very looong 82 minutes. As a matter of fact, it 
   takes nearly half of the film before the three sisters even make it 
   to their father's mansion, as Milligan insists on showing us the 
   minutae of the sisters' everyday life, from what type of dressing 
   they like on their salad to the exploits of an (obviously) gay butler 
   and a drunk, aging actress that lives with one of the sisters. None 
   of this does anything to advance the plot. It's just there to fill up 
   time. As with most Milligan films, this is supposed to be a period 
   piece, but you can hear the noise of automobile traffic in some of 
   the scenes and modern-day power lines can be seen running from some 
   of the houses. There's also an out-of-place sequence where the 
   sisters visit a long-haired hippie prophet, who has a freak-out 
   scene. The cheapness of this Staten Island, NY-lensed borefest (one 
   of the few 70's Milligan films not to be made for producer William 
   Mishkin) becomes highly apparent when the Handley sisters and their 
   husbands are waiting at a train station and the arrival of the train 
   is nothing more than someone out-of-frame discharging a fire 
   extinguisher at the actors' feet to simulate a steam engine! There 
   are scattered bits of gore, but none of it is worth the pain you'll 
   have to endure by watching this gabfest. The funniest scene comes 
   early in the film when two New York toughs grab the retarded brother 
   and toss him off a train platform. He falls at least twenty feet, 
   lands on his head and only ends up with a broken arm, which 
   miraculously heals in a couple of days! Save your sanity and pass 
   this one up. If you have already seen <B>THE GHASTLY ONES</B>, I can 
   think of no good reason to watch this, because it is a scene-by-scene 
   remake, including all of the murders (all of which happen in the 
   final 15 minutes). Hell, even if you've never seen <B>THE GHASTLY O</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">NES</FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">,

    LEGEND OF BLOODY JACK</A><A NAME="LegendOfBloodyJack"></A> (2007) -</B> 
   One of the last surviving family members of notorious serial killer 
   (and lumberjack) Bloody Jack brings his girlfriend to the Alaskan 
   wilderness to bring Jack back to life and document it on a video 
   camera. After reading a passage from Jack's journal and laying a 
   fresh heart on the ground, Carol (Lauren Cashman) returns to the 
   hotel while her boyfriend, Pat (Garrett Brawith), decides to spend a 
   couple of hours in the woods, just to make sure he didn't revive 
   Bloody Jack. He falls asleep (!) and when he wakes up, the heart is 
   missing and he's chopped into pieces with an axe by Bloody Jack. So 
   begins another cheapjack slasher flick with an unexceptional 
   killer&nbsp; (a lumberjack with a scarf covering his face!) and a 
   bunch of by-the-numbers victims. We then switch to seven twenty-someth<A HREF="legend_of_bloody_jack_2007.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/legend of bloody jack dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="191" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ing
    slackers spending the weekend in a cabin in the same neck of the 
   woods that Bloody Jack is prowling. After getting some <B><A HREF="big_chill.htm">BIG
    CHILL</A></B>-type personal issues out of the way (&quot;Welcome to 
   the first day of the rest of your boring lives!&quot;) and then 
   having sex, Bloody Jack begins dispatching the cast with his axe. The 
   first one chopped to pieces is Tom (Josh Evans), who goes outside to 
   get some wood for the fireplace (his body parts are then stacked like 
   cords of wood). When Ray (Travis Young) sees all the blood, he wants 
   to search for Tom, but is talked out of it by Nick (Craig Bonacorsi), 
   saying it is much too dangerous to go walking in the woods at night. 
   George (John Kawalski) is the next to die, as Bloody Jack lops off 
   his penis while he is taking a piss in the woods and then tries to 
   plant his axe in the body of George's girlfriend, Lisa (Jessica 
   Szabo), but she escapes and makes it back to the cabin. Too bad she 
   shows up a couple of minutes after Officer Vince (Jeremy Flynn) has 
   left the premises (Don't worry, Bloody Jack hides in the back of 
   Officer Vince's cruiser and delivers a fatal axe blow to his neck as 
   he is driving away). The rest of the film is nothing but the 
   remainder of the cast trying to avoid Bloody Jack and his axe, 
   usually failing in grand fashion by doing the stupidest thing 
   possible at the worst time imaginable (Who in their right mind takes 
   a shower with a maniac loose in the house?). The film ends with a 
   pitiful CGI car explosion and then reveals that the entire film was a 
   ghost story told over a camp fire by the same exact cast of 
   characters, who are then mercifully killed quickly by Bloody Jack. 
   Believe me when I say that I was happy to see them go.&nbsp; This 
   boring, flatly-filmed slasher flick, directed/written/edited by Todd 
   Portugal (<B><A HREF="flooding_2000.htm">FLOODING</A></B> - 2000) is 
   rough going, even for the most patient slasher film fanatics. The 
   acting never rises above high school thespian level and the gore, 
   while plentiful, is never convincing (in one scene, as Lisa watches 
   Bloody Jack chop-up George in the woods, we can see the actor playing 
   Bloody Jack pulling his axe blows, never making contact with George's 
   body). The character of Bloody Jack is another major drawback to the 
   film. It seems he has the power to appear and disappear at will, yet 
   he can be shot, knocked-out and kicked to the ground like a normal 
   person. Not once does he come across as terrifying or scary; he looks 
   like some average guy in a flannel shirt and scarf covering his 
   burned face (Why is his face burned? It's never explained.). Don't 
   waste your time with this one. It's weak, slow-moving and doesn't 
   contain one working brain cell in its tiny little head. Oh, and 
   there's some topless nudity in a few scenes, if that makes any 
   difference. It shouldn't. Also starring Erica Hoag, Alicia Klein, 
   Pamela Porter, Tricia Allen and Matt Nelson and Jeffrey Allen, who 
   take turns portraying Bloody Jack. An <A HREF="http://www.theasylum.cc">Asylum

   (Katsy Joiner), who lost her uncle to the creature's hunger, and a 
   group of cryptozoologists who document her search for the origins of 
   the Chupacabra or, the &quot;goat sucker&quot;. Something sucks, all 
   right, and me thinks it's this film. Where do I begin? It's 
   atrociously acted. It's obvious from the start that this documentary 
   is scripted as the dialogue doesn't feel natural and the 
   &quot;actors&quot; fail miserably in delivering it. The Chupacabra 
   appears within the first ten minutes of the film, negating any 
   suspense in the group's search for it. Let's talk about this 
   Chupacabra: It's a ridiculous concoction (by director Joe Castro), 
   with a giant mutated chicken-like head, huge talon-like claws, a 
   fur-covered body and long porcupine-like needles sticking out of its' 
   back. It makes the creature in <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Blood Freak">BLOOD
    FREAK</A></B> look absolutely polished. This film is filled with 
   unbelievable situations which the characters react to in unbelievable 
   and, downright idiotic, ways. Who would lock themselves in a cage 
   made of chicken wire to take a shot at this creature when you have 
   seen what strength it possesses? These stupid characters do. As a 
   matter of fact, everyone in this film does something so extremely 
   stupid, that you root for the creature to end their miserable lives. 
   If there's one positive thing I can say about this flick, it's that 
   it's extremely bloody. Intestines are ripped out, someone takes a 
   shotgun blast to the head, an arm is ripped out of its' socket, 
   bloody psychic surgery and various bloody aftermaths of the creature 
   are shown lovingly in close-up. But as I have said many times before, 
   good effects don't make a good film. Director Joe Castro learned 
   nothing from his previous failure: The crappy &quot;college students 
   trapped in a mansion with a demon&quot; film <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Ceremony">CEREMONY</A></B>

   Horror Westerns were a very small sub-genre until the New Millennium

   wasn't tapped more frequently when it came to making horror films. 
   Sure, there were a handful of horror-themed Westerns throughout the 
   decades, some well-known (William &quot;One Shot&quot; Beaudine's <B><A HREF="jesse_james_meets_frankensteins_daughter_1966.htm">JESSE

    FOR THE LADIES</A></B> - 1974]), but it took the Computer Age for 
   this sub-genre to finally catch on. It is my opinion that they are so 
   popular now because people want to see how problems can be solved 
   without the use of computers, the internet or cell phones; in a era 
   when guns, guts and wits settled most problems. <B>LEGEND</B> begins 
   with this on-screen scrawl: &quot;The Pelgidium legend says that evil 
   manifests itself on Earth as a human every couple of hundred years 
   and searches the Earth for the person who unknowingly harbors the 
   'lost spirit' of a warrior chief. When that evil finds the warrior 
   chief, a process of torture begins that eventually leads to a battle 
   for supremacy. This battle only takes place within the ancient walls 
   of the city of Trigon.&quot; After watching one such battle between

    medicine man and the Pelgidium in the American West in the year 1165 
   A.D., the film flashes ahead to the same territory in 1865, as a 
   family traveling in a covered wagon is attacked by an outlaw gang 
   headed by Blade (screenwriter Robert McRay), leaving a father and his 
   young son dead and mother Sarah Jenkins (Denise Crosby; <B><A HREF="mortuary_2005.htm">MORTUARY</A></B> 
   - 2005), who is raped, and her young daughter Melanie (Alexis Bond) 
   to fend for themselves. Penniless and robbed of all their belongings, 
   Sarah and Melanie walk to the small town of Saugust and are taken-in 
   by General Store owner Nathan (Stefan Gierasch; <B><A HREF="blood_beach_1981.htm">BLOOD
    BEACH</A></B> - 1980) and his wife Jane (Julie Erickson), who inform 
   Sarah that Blade and his gang have killed the sheriff and taken over 
   the town. While Sarah searches for someone in the town to help her 
   get revenge for the death of her husband and son, Blade and his 
   right-hand man Suicide (Zen Gesner) begin killing townspeople who 
   don't share their views, beginning with the town's judge (George 
   Murdock; <B><A HREF="breaker_breaker_1977.htm">BREAKER! BREAKER!</A></B> 
   - 1977), the new sheriff (Mark Colliver) and the mayor, with Blade 
   taking over as sheriff, Suicide as judge and other members of the 
   gang filling other positions of authority that have just opened up. 
   During a secret town meeting, where Sarah and a bunch of concerned 
   citizens discuss ways to overthrow Blade and his gang, Blade appears 
   and shoots little Melanie in the head, putting her in a coma that Doc 
   Fisher (Rance Howard; <B><A HREF="sasquatch_mountain_2006.htm">SASQUATCH
    MOUNTAIN</A></B> - 2006) tells Sarah is irreversible. It becomes 
   apparent that Sarah unknowingly harbors the 'lost spirit' of a 
   warrior chief (played by Saginaw Grant) and Blade is the evil that 
   manifests itself every couple hundred years. Sarah is able to call 
   forth the Pelgidium (also played by Robert McRay), who takes form as 
   a long-haired, facially-deformed masked gunman that begins to 
   systematically kill Blade's gang one-by-one, until only Blade is 
   left. Blade figures the only way to get rid of the Pelgidium is to 
   kill Sarah, but the townspeople finally grow a backbone and hide 
   Sarah from him. Will Sarah get the revenge she so richly deserves, 
   especially when Blade kidnaps the comatose Melanie and holds her 
   hostage?&nbsp; While confusing as hell, director/producer Alex 
   Erkiletian (his feature film debut) at least offers enough bloody 
   violence (although some of the violence, including Nathan having one 
   of his hands cut off and Doc Fisher getting beheaded, is played 
   off-screen) and good character actors, including Angus Scrimm (<B><A HREF="phantasm_1979.htm">PHANTASM</A></B>

   beast), to offset Robert McCray's much-too-mystical screenplay (which 
   he wrote using the name &quot;Robert Ray&quot;). The biggest problem 
   this film has, besides the incomprehensible supernatural plot, is 
   that Blade seems to have an inexhaustible supply of gang members at 
   his beck and call. For every one that the Pelgidium kills, two seem 
   to take his place. It makes no sense because the town should be 
   teeming with bad guys, but the streets are always empty. Putting all

   deceased, causing problems in a small Irish community. The chief of 
   police (Arthur Kennedy) blames the recent rash of murders on a newly 
   arrived young couple (Ray Lovelock and Cristina Galbo), who he 
   believes are drug-taking devil worshippers. Lovelock makes the 
   connection between the pest-control machine and the revived dead 
   after visiting the hospital (which also serves as the town morgue) 
   and witnesses a newborn baby attacking a nurse (the machine also 
   affects the newly born). After he and Galbo are nearly devoured by a

   and is promptly arrested. Galbo is attacked by her dead

   return from the dead and put the bite on Kennedy. This gory shocker 
   is an effective addition to the living dead genre. Nice locations, 
   eerie atmosphere, an unusual storyline and bloody mayhem (including a 
   woman having her breast ripped off) make this film better than most 
   of its kind. The only thing out of place here is Arthur Kennedy (</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="action.htm#Mean Machine">THE

   This is the least talked about movie in director Mario Bava's vast 
   list of films, even though Bava himself has stated it's his favorite 
   film of his career. It may also be his most personal, as it deals 
   with subject matter unlike any of his other films. The fact that 
   Producer Alfredo Leone re-edited this film, directed new inserts 
   (starring Robert Alda, who was not in the original version) and 
   released it under a different title with a wholely different plot 
   about an exorcism because he thought audiences weren't smart enough 
   to understand what Bava was trying to convey, only attests to this 
   film's power.<A HREF="lisa_and_the_devil_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/lisa and the devil amazon poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="229" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Luckily, the original version still exists for all us 
   &quot;uneducated&quot; folks to enjoy and I'm glad to say that this 
   is one of Bava's best films of his career. Alfredo Leone's version? A 
   piece of shit, only good for a cursory look and then best forgotten.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The film opens with tourist Lisa (Elke Sommer; Bava's <B><A HREF="baron_blood_1972.htm">BARON
    BLOOD</A></B> - 1972) being part of a walking tour of Toledo, Spain. 
   Their tour guide shows everyone a <A HREF="lisa_and_the_devil_1973.htm#Fresco">fresco</A> 
   in a market square of the Devil carrying his victims back to Hell, 
   when Lisa hears some catchy music and tells her friend to wait for 
   her, she will be right back. She follows the music to an antique 
   store, where a strange music box is playing the tune. She asks the 
   shopkeeper (Franz von Treuberg; <B><A HREF="action.htm#ExecutionSquad1972">EXECUTION
    SQUAD</A></B> - 1972) how much the music box costs and he tells her 
   it is not for sale, it belongs to the gentleman he is currently 
   dealing with. When the gentleman turns around, it is Leandro (Telly 
   Savalas; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#KillerOnPhone1972">THE 
   KILLER IS ON THE PHONE</A></B> - 1972), who looks exactly like the 
   Devil in the fresco. Lisa, who is scared out of her wits, leaves the 
   store in a hurry (We hear Leandro say to the shopkeeper, &quot;How 
   strange. It's like she saw the Devil.&quot;). Lisa gets hopelessly 
   lost, can't find the market square and everyone she asks for 
   directions either ignores her or turns and walks away without saying 
   a word. She then runs into Leandro, who is holding a 
   realistic-looking mannequin and the music box. She nervously asks him 
   where the market square is and he says it's directly behind her, so 
   she turns around and sees a street that wasn't there before. She 
   follows it and is accosted by a man who looks exactly like Leandro's 
   mannequin. He calls her &quot;Elena&quot;, puts his hands on her 
   shoulders and asks her if she didn't think he would find her, causing 
   Lisa to push him down a flight of stone stairs, killing him (his 
   pocket watch falls to the ground, revealing a photo of Lisa inside it).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Lisa runs away quickly and the next time we see her, it is nighttime 
   and she is still lost. She sees an antique limousine up ahead and 
   asks&nbsp; the apparently wealthy man, Francis Lehar (Eduardo 
   Fajardo; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#KnifeOfIce1972">KNIFE OF ICE</A></B> 
   - 1972), and his snooty wife, Sophia (Sylva Koscina; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CrimesBlackCat">CRIMES
    OF THE BLACK CAT</A></B> - 1972), for a ride, so Francis tells his 
   chauffeur, George (Gabriele Tinti; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#TropicOfCancer1972">TROPIC
    OF CANCER</A></B> - 1972), to take the lady where she needs to go, 
   but George tells him the hoses on the engine are leaking water and it 
   probably will not go far. After a very short distance, the limo 
   breaks down, right in front of Leandro's home (It's also apparent 
   that by the looks they are giving each other that Sophia and George 
   are having an affair, which doesn't go unnoticed by Francis). Francis 
   asks Leandro if he can use his phone to call a mechanic and Leandro 
   says there is no phone in the home, because &quot;We have no use for 
   it, you see.&quot; A handsome young man named Max (Alessio Orano; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#KillerMustKillAgain">THE
    KILLER MUST KILL AGAIN</A></B> - 1973) appears behind Lisa and says 
   to her, &quot;Please stay, don't go away&quot; and then walks away. 
   We then discover that Leandro is not the owner of this home at all, 
   he's actually the butler to a wealthy aristocrat called &quot;The 
   Countess' (Alida Valli; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#EyeInTheLabyrinth">EYE
    IN THE LABYRINTH</A></B> - 1972).&nbsp; Max invites everyone into 
   the house, telling them that he lives here with his mother, The 
   Countess. Leandro doesn't seem too pleased with having strangers in 
   the house, but he has no other choice but to welcome them. The 
   Countess doesn't want anyone in her mansion, telling Max and Leandro 
   to show the guests to the adjoining cottage. George manages to get 
   the limo started and parks it on the cottage grounds, as we watch 
   Leandro padlock the cottage gate as soon as George pulls in. We then 
   watch Sophia and George making love, Sophia telling him not to worry, 
   her husband doesn't care (he does). Lisa sees the man she pushed down 
   the stairs and killed staring at her through a window, scaring her, 
   and when she runs outside, Max tells her not to be frightened, it's 
   just Leandro's mannequin, telling Lisa that his mother's mansion is 
   full of Leandro's mannequins.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Over dinner, The Countess asks her son where the &quot;fifth 
   guest&quot; is, but Max says she's mistaken, there are only four 
   guests (Later on, The Countess says this about the fifth guest: 
   &quot;I knew he would return!&quot;). We then see Max serving a piece 
   of cake to an unknown weeping woman. He says, &quot;Did you know he 
   was back? You mustn't see him! You must send him away! I will not let 
   him come between us again! He's caused enough anguish! He'll never 
   enter this room! You'll never leave this room! Do you hear me? 
   Never!&quot;&nbsp; George tapes up the limo's leaking hoses, Leandro 
   asking him if they are leaving at once. George says yes and thanks 
   him for the tape, asking Leandro (who seemingly can be in two places 
   at once) to inform the other guests that they are ready to leave. 
   When George tells Leandro that the engine is fixed, but it took a lot 
   of tape, Leandro says, &quot;Most things aren't that easy to 
   mend.&quot; We then see Max pacing a room and cursing the &quot;fifth 
   guest&quot; for coming back, saying that his mother knew he would 
   come back, but he didn't think he had the courage to do so. &quot;Just
    when I found happiness, I won't let you destroy everything! How can 
   I stop you when I can't even see you?&quot;, Max yells into the 
   darkness. Francis asks Lisa where she needs to go once the car is 
   fixed and Leandro says she won't be leaving with them because Max 
   asked her to stay here. The Countess then comes into the room and 
   asks Lisa to come to her and feels her face. A strange look forms on 
   The Countess' face and she asks Leandro the color of Lisa's eyes. He 
   says, Changeable, my lady, but by candlelight...blue.&quot; Everyone 
   is shocked to learn that The Countess is blind because, at dinner, 
   she didn't appear so and seemed&nbsp; to look at everyone directly in 
   their eyes (although the clues were there if you watched closely 
   enough). The Countess then says, &quot;You wouldn't listen when I 
   told you to stay away. Now it's too late!&quot; and walks out of the 
   room. We then see Max opening a journal to a page with Lisa's photo 
   on it. Underneath the photo is a handwritten message that reads, 
   &quot;To Carlo forever. Love, Elena&quot;. Max then takes the photo 
   and burns it. Are the pieces beginning to fit together in your mind 
   now? If not, allow me to continue...</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Sophia wonders what is taking George so long and Francis tells her 
   to calm down. When Sophia refuses to calm down, Francis says he will 
   see what's holding up George and leaves the room. Lisa turns on the 
   music box and all the figures on it begin to move (including a figure 
   of the Grim Reaper), but no music plays. A short time later, Sophia 
   hears the limo's horn and runs out of the room, while Leandro enters 
   and places a cassette tape player into a secret compartment, which is 
   playing the music box's theme music. Leandro then says to Lisa, 
   &quot;I find that invariably, Miss Lisa, there's a very simple 
   explanation for almost everything, don't you agree?&quot; Lisa just 
   sits there, not saying a single word and staring at the <A HREF="lisa_and_the_devil_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/lisa and the devil italy dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>figurines
    moving to the music. Lisa is then transported back in time, where 
   her doppleganger Elena is madly in love with Carlo (Espartaco 
   Santoni; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#FeastOfSatan">THE FEAST OF SATAN</A></B> 
   - 1971). They kiss passionately and make love (In the same room the 
   weeping woman is now trapped in. It wouldn't be too much of a spoiler 
   to mention that Elena is the weeping woman, if she even exists now.). 
   When Lisa opens her eyes, she is passionately kissing Max, but it 
   turns out to be nothing but a nightmarish vision, as when Lisa does 
   open her eyes she is staring at the music box.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Sophia runs to the limo, but George is not there. Francis appears, 
   calls his wife a &quot;slut&quot; and slaps her hard across the face, 
   sending Sophia reeling backwards. She grabs the limo's door handle 
   and out falls a dead George, his throat cut. But who is it we see 
   holding a pair of bloody scissors? George's body is brought into the 
   mansion, where a crying Sophia strokes his hair and cries out, 
   &quot;Why? Why?&quot;, as Leandro puts George's body in a wheelbarrow 
   (!) and rolls him away. Leandro says, &quot;It's not always wise to 
   stir up the past. We all have some unforgiveable secret&quot;, as 
   everyone follows the wheelbarrow to George's final resting place 
   (Francis doesn't want to call the police and Leandro says if he and 
   his wife leave immediately, he will take care of the body.). We then 
   discover that Carlo is very much alive, as we see him in Elena's 
   room, the bloody scissors lying on a nearby table. We then see 
   Leandro putting George's corpse into a coffin, but when George is too 
   tall to fit in the coffin, Leandro breaks George's legs at his 
   ankles, stuffing his feet into the coffin (It's funny and repulsive 
   at the same moment). But it is then revealed it is not George's body 
   in thecoffin, it's Carlo's (or is it his mannequin doppleganger?). 
   Lisa sees the body while spying on Leandro and stops herself from 
   screaming so as to not tip him off. Carlo then walks up to Lisa, 
   calls her Elena and she runs away screaming (she doesn't try to stop 
   herself this time!). What the Hell is going on here? Lisa then finds 
   herself in Elena's room, which is full of creepy mannequins. Carlo 
   grabs her and she passes out, Carlo saying, &quot;I want to help you, 
   Elena. I love you!&quot; We then see Sophia crying over George's 
   body, which is lying on a bed. Francis enters the room and says, 
   &quot;If you are through mourning your lover, we can leave.&quot; He 
   grabs his wife from the bed, pulling her out of the room and saying, 
   &quot;Let's go!&quot; Francis tells her to get in the car. but Sophia 
   tells him she is going nowhere with him, she's going to stay until 
   George is buried. Francis forces her into the limo, says, &quot;We 
   can do without the chauffeur&quot; and tries to enter the car, but 
   Sophia starts the engine, steps on the gas and runs her husband over, 
   killing him. She not only runs him over, she puts the car in reverse 
   and runs him over again! Then again! And again once more! And one 
   more time for good luck (it's quite shocking)!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Lisa wakes up in Elena's bed with Carlo hovering over her saying 
   that he loves her, but someone sneaks up behind him and&nbsp; and 
   cracks Carlo's skull open with a gold pipe. Sophia watches in horror 
   as it happens and runs away screaming, but she is bludgeoned to death 
   by the same gold pipe, being swung over and over by...Max. While Lisa 
   is passed out in Elena's bed, Leandro enters the room with Carlo's 
   mannequin, whose face is now cracked. He repairs the mannequin's face 
   while rambling on and on about how The Countess bosses him around. We 
   then discover that Carlo was The Countess' husband and she has a 
   &quot;funeral&quot; for Carlo on a regular basis, which is why 
   Leandro has a Carlo mannequin. When Lisa wakes up, Leandro tells her 
   everything, including that Carlo has been dead for many years. So why 
   is Lisa covered in his blood? The Countess knows that Lisa is the 
   spitting image of Elena, who was Carlo's illicit lover. The Countess 
   wants Lisa dead, telling Leandro to get Max to do the dirty deed. But 
   who does Lisa run to for help? That's right, Max, who is quite 
   insane. He introduces Lisa to Elena, who is nothing but a skeleton in 
   a wedding dress lying in bed. It turns out Max was also in love with 
   Elena (no surprise there), but he killed her when she 
   &quot;deceived&quot; him, keeping her body in the room and talking to 
   her like she was alive. Max now has his Elena alive once more in the 
   body of Lisa. Can she escape all this insanity before she becomes 
   insane herself or ends up dead? Max tells Lisa he loves her, so he 
   knocks her out with a rag dipped in formaldehyde, undresses her and 
   places her next to Elena's skeleton on the bed. &quot;It will be 
   different with you. It has to be!&quot;, says Max, as he gets 
   undressed and climbs on top of a naked Lisa, ready to do the nasty. 
   He imagines (?) Elena laughing at him and he can't go through with it 
   (Did I mention he was quite mad? Who wouldn't want to boff a naked 
   Elke Sommer, who looks fantastic here!?!). Max tells his mother that 
   there will no longer be funerals in the mansion, only weddings, but 
   The Countess tells Max that people are going to miss the victims he 
   murdered today and the police will probably come for him, but Mother 
   will protect him. Max decides to kill one more person, so he murders 
   his mother by stabbing her in the chest with a large knife. Leandro 
   has set up a wedding ceremony for Max, complete with Elena's skeleton 
   as the bride and all the people he murdered as guests. Max sees The 
   Countess approaching him, holding her hand to her bloody chest wound. 
   He keeps backing away from his mother until he falls out a window to 
   his death, splattering on the cobblestones below. It turns out not to 
   be The Countess at all, but one of Leandro's lifelike mannequins. 
   Leandro no longer has to worry about The Countess or Max ever bossing 
   him around again. So what about Lisa, you may ask?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Lisa wakes up in Elena's room, completely naked. She gets dressed 
   and walks out of the mansion, which is overrun with vegitation and is 
   in ruins, as if it hasn't been occupied for decades, if not longer. 
   Among the ruins lies Max's mannequin, who says to Lisa, &quot;We will 
   be together forever. Don't go.&quot; Lisa discovers some children 
   playing with a ball nearby and when the ball rolls to Lisa and she 
   picks it up, one of the little girls says, &quot;She's a ghost. 
   Everyone knows that. No one has lived there for a hundred 
   years!&quot;, so all the children run away. What does this all mean? 
   That is up to the viewer to decide, but I will tell you this: When 
   Lisa hails a taxi and tells the driver to take her to the airport, we 
   see Leandro looking at Lisa while the antique store shopkeeper hands 
   him a mannequin that is the exact replica of Lisa. The shopkeeper 
   says, &quot;This is the best I could do because I had such short 
   notice. I do hope you think it's alright, sir.&quot; All Leandro says 
   is, &quot;I'm afraid it is all too late. All too late.&quot;, as he 
   watches the taxi pull away. When Lisa boards the plane and it takes 
   off, she discovers she is the only person on the plane, at least in 
   her section. We then hear Leandro say over the intercom, &quot;I hope 
   you have a pleasant trip.&quot; When Lisa checks the rest of the 
   plane, she discovers she isn't alone. The corpses from the mansion 
   are passengers and<A HREF="lisa_and_the_devil_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/house of exorcism poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="203" HEIGHT="311" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Leandro is the pilot. The final shot is of Lisa, her skin pale and

   at the camera and smiling. <B><FONT COLOR="MAROON">THE END</FONT></B>.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   choice for people who want to compare both versions and if they don't

    EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW</A></B> - 1974) and two guards enter a 
   castle prison and escort Adele Karnstein, who is accused of being a 
   witch, to her trial. While the entire village is watching the trial, 
   Adele's daughter Helen (Barbara Steele; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Ghost1963">THE
    GHOST</A></B> - 1963) sneaks into the castle to talk to Count 
   Humbolt (Giuliano Raffaelli, as &quot;Jean Rafferty&quot;; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#BloodBlackLace1964">BLOOD
    AND BLACK LACE</A></B> - 1964) to plead for her mother's life. Helen 
   is also being sought as a witch by Von Klage and the Count's son Kurt 
   (George Ardisson; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Don'tLookAttic1982">DON'T
    LOOK IN THE ATTIC</A></B> - 1982), but they don't know what she 
   looks like because Adele kept her away from the village her entire 
   life. The Count tells Helen there is very little he can do and, even 
   if he could, he wouldn't, because Adele is also accused of murdering 
   his brother, Franz. Helen tells him that her mother is not a witch 
   and she can prove someone in the castle murdered his brother. Rather 
   than delaying Adele's trial, the Count puts the moves on Helen, 
   raping her. Adele's younger daughter, Lisabeth, is at the trial and 
   watches as her mother is found guilty of being a witch and is 
   immediately put to death, not by being burned at the stake, but by 
   being put in a maze made of entwined twigs and branches, which is set 
   on fire, burning all around her. Before she burns to death, Adele 
   grabs the huge wooden cross in the middle of the maze and curses the 
   Humbolt family line for all eternity. Helen tries to escape from the 
   Count, but he grabs her outside and throws her to her death down a 
   steep waterfall, saying, &quot;Now our secret is safe.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Lisabeth is then taken care of by the kindly Grumalda (Laura Nucci, 
   as &quot;Laureen Nuyen&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#BloodstainShadow78">THE
    BLOODSTAINED SHADOW</A></B> - 1978), who tells Lisabeth that she has 
   collected her mother's ashes and Helen's body and buried them in a 
   &quot;secret place&quot; that only the two of them know about and she 
   can go to that place to pray to her mother and sister any time she 
   wants. Years pass and Lisabeth is now a beautiful grown woman (Halina 
   Zalewska; <B><A HREF="snow_devils_1967.htm">SNOW DEVILS</A></B> - 
   1967). Kurt has a romantic interest in her that the Count doesn't 
   approve of. We find out at this time that Kurt is the one who 
   murdered Franz so his father could rule the land. When the Count 
   hears this, he is livid (he didn't know) and tries to choke the life 
   out of Kurt, but fails. Lisabeth sees the Count go to Franz's tomb 
   and begs Franz's skeleton for forgiveness, saying he put an innocent 
   woman to death under the guise of witchcraft. The Count is horrified 
   to see his brother's skeleton move, taking it as a sign that his 
   brother is coming back to life and runs away, not knowing that the 
   skeleton moved because of rats inside of Franz's tattered clothing.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Kurt forces Lisabeth to marry him, but the only way he can make love 
   to her is by force (&quot;You had my body, but not my soul!&quot;). 
   He doesn't know that she heard the Count confess to Franz. Lisabeth 
   forms a plan of vengeance against the Humbolts and it's a doozy. The 
   Black Plague strikes the village and no one in the castle is allowed 
   to venture outside, just as no one from the outside is allowed to 
   enter the castle grounds. The Count becomes stricken with the Plague 
   and Lisabeth sneaks outside to the secret place, where she begs her 
   mother and sister to get even with the Humbolts. A tremendous 
   thunderstorm follows, soaking the secret place and raising the dead. 
   The Count dies and Kurt then becomes ruler, but even stranger is the 
   sudden appearance of Mary, who looks exactly like Helen (both played 
   by Steele). Mary tells Kurt she has no idea who she is or how she got 
   there and Kurt doesn't recognize her because he never met Helen. At 
   the Count's funeral, his body is carried through the church by Von 
   Klage's hooded minions, where Kurt hits on Mary, knowing full well 
   that adultery is punishable by death. Mary spurns his advances, but 
   Grumalda sees it happen. She tells Lisabeth what she saw and she then 
   tells Kurt that if he lays a finger on Mary, he will regret it. Kurt 
   doesn't take kindly to threats and then he rapes Mary (like father, 
   like son), which Lisabeth witnesses. She is tempted to stab Kurt in 
   the back with a dagger but stops herself, knowing that his actual 
   death will be far more painful. Von Klage has a man ride out on 
   horseback to deliver a message to a far-away village telling them 
   about the Plague, giving him a container of wine for his travels. At 
   dinner a few days later, Grumalda announces that the messenger has 
   been found dead in the woods, the apparent victim of a poisoning. The 
   news upsets both Lisabeth and Von Klage, who leave the table. Kurt 
   then tells Mary that it was he who poisoned the messenger and he 
   plans on doing the same thing to Lisabeth so he and Mary can become 
   legally married. Kurt doses Lisabeth's nightly drink with a drug to 
   knock her out, which she drinks. Kurt and Mary go to see if his plan 
   worked, but they are scared away by a huge shadow that passes by 
   Lisabeth's bedroom window. A short time later, they return to 
   Lisabeth's bedroom, where Mary pokes Lisabeth with a needle to make 
   sure she is out cold. Kurt carries Lisabeth to the family mausoleum, 
   where he places her body in an empty tomb and seals the heavy stone 
   lid with wax, so no air can get inside, killing Lisabeth. Von Klage 
   comes into the mausoleum and Kurt and Mary hide, watching Von Klage 
   lock the mausoleum gate behind him and placing the key in a hole in 
   the wall, trapping the pair inside. Neither Kurt or Mary can reach 
   the key, so they try to find another way out, discovering a secret 
   passageway that leads directly to Lisabeth's bedroom. A few hours 
   later, they use the secret passageway to retrieve Lisabeth's dead 
   body (Mary puts a lit candle next to Lisabeth's nose to make sure she 
   is dead) and then place her body in her bed, making it look like she 
   died in her sleep. The next morning, the pair expect the bad news, 
   but Grumalda appears and announces Lisabeth has awoken and she's 
   &quot;very hungry&quot;. Kurt can't believe his ears and runs to 
   Lisabeth's bedroom, but she is not there. Mary tells him that 
   Grumalda is probably lying, but it doesn't explain the many people 
   who tell Kurt that they have just seen or talked to Lisabeth (but 
   Kurt never sees her).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Kurt believes there is a conspiracy against him, but it is much 
   worse than that, as Kurt wakes up in his bed with Lisabeth on top of 
   him. He screams and she disappears, but how can he explain the long 
   strands of Lisabeth's hair that he finds in one of his hands? The 
   Karnstein curse comes true, as Kurt is driven mad by the 
   unexplainable events that surround him, resulting in the Black Plague 
   vanishing and Kurt exposing his evil self in front of a group of 
   important dignitaries. A drunk Kurt then confronts Lisabeth in the 
   same castle cell that her mother was confined in before she was 
   burned to death. It turns out Mary is the spectre of Helen&nbsp; and 
   Lisabeth is very much alive, both there to make sure Kurt doesn't 
   escape his fate. No matter where Kurt runs, Helen's ghost is there, 
   turning him into a blithering, incoherent fool who becomes trapped 
   inside an idol that is to be burned in a ceremony to celebrate the 
   ending of the Plague (like a miniature version of <B><A HREF="wicker_man_1973.htm">THE
    WICKER MAN</A></B> - 1973). Everyone applauds while the idol burns, 
   only Lisabeth, Helen and Grumalda knowing that the Plague is not the 
   only thing leaving the village. A fitting end to an evil despot.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   which is a shame because it would have frightened many people back in 
   the '60s, as it does today. Like most Italian gothic horror films, 
   this one, too, fell into the Public Domain (PD), where it received 
   many VHS releases, mostly from gray market sellers (Something Weird 
   Video, Sinister Cinema, etc.). It was also released on many PD DVD 
   labels using a fullscreen print, including <A HREF="http://www.oldies.com">Alpha

   letting go until the satisfying ending. As with most Raro releases, 
   the film is offered in its original Italian language with English 
   subtitles (my preferred way of watching foreign films) or English 
   dubbed and contains some interesting extras, including both English 
   and Italian trailers, as well as an interview with Margheriti's son, 
   Edoardo (Antonio passed away at the end of 2002), who regales us with 
   stories about working in various capacities on his father's films. 
   Antonio hated the sight of blood, which is why he filmed most of his 
   gothic horror films in black &amp; white (It also explains why his 
   bloodless mid-'60s sci-fi films, such as <B><A HREF="wild_wild_planet_1965.htm">WILD,

   gore-soaked films, including his father's <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Cannibal Apoc">CANNIBAL

   one, that is. The film opens in 1990, in the Scottish Highlands, as 
   we watch someone in a black cab drive a doctor to a secret location 
   behind a waterfall, where he bloodily delivers a baby from a woman 
   that is tied up with a burlap sack over her head. As soon as the baby 
   is delivered, that same someone (in a black hood) blows the doctor's 
   head off with a shotgun. We then switch to the present, where Rebecca 
   (Shian Denovan) and her boyfriend Jamie (Ross Maxwell) are at a bar 
   on Halloween Night. Rebecca gets very angry with Jamie when she finds 
   out he was snorting coke in the bathroom, so she leaves the bar with 
   Jamie following her. He hands over his stash of coke to Rebecca, who 
   puts it in her pocketbook and refuses to get into Jamie's car because 
   she believes he is in no condition to drive. He leaves in a huff and 
   Jamie notices a black cab (with black-out windows) nearby and hops 
   in. We hear a scream, the cab shakes and then it drives off. We then 
   meet Sawney Bean (David Hayman; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BurkeAndHare2010">BURKE
    &amp; HARE</A></B> - 2010), back at his secret location behind the 
   waterfall (it's actually an abandoned mine), where he has Rebecca 
   tied-up. He takes a bite out of her and rapes her (seems he keeps his 
   bloodline alive by kidnapping women and getting them pregnant), then 
   going back to his duties of preparing a bowl of human body parts and 
   innards as a meal for &quot;Mother&quot;, who is a prisoner behind a 
   locked door and kept somewhat docile by opera music that plays on a 
   boombox. He then rifles through Rebecca's pocket book and finds 
   photos of her in a bikini and begins to masturbate with a dismembered 
   human hand! The film then takes us to the funeral of Charlotte 
   McIntyre (Elich Nairn), where alcoholic newspaper reporter Hamish 
   MacDonald (Samuel Feeney), who was a friend of Charlotte's and is the 
   ex-boyfriend of Charlotte's sister Wendy (Elizabeth Brown), sits in 
   his car in the pouring rain trying to figure out who killed her. 
   According to Hamish's source, Detective Bill Munro (Gavin Mitchell), 
   Charlotte was found at an ancient Druid sacrificial site in the 
   Scottish Highlands. Well, just her head was found (it is impaled on a 
   pole, maggots crawling out of her eye sockets) in a makeshift human 
   body. The only problem is the rest of the body parts found there were 
   all from different human bodies (Bill gives Hamish photos of the 
   crime scene) and it looks as if someone has chewed on the body parts. 
   Bill's police captain, Charlie McGuire (William Houston), is not 
   happy that Hamish is having his stories on the case make the front 
   page of the newspaper, so he tells Bill to stick close to Hamish and 
   make sure that the information he gives him is misleading or minimal. 
   As Hamish is getting closer to the truth, going to the library and 
   finding a newspaper article on microfiche dating back to 1970, where 
   another woman was found in the same dismembered condition as 
   Charlotte and a photo of that crime scene contains valuable 
   information to the location of the murderer, Sawney Bean and his 
   black-hoodied &quot;sons&quot;, Judd (Jean-Paul Jesstience) and Jake 
   (Will Sutton), who are both well-versed in martial arts and parkour 
   (the French term for being able to jump, climb or run long distances 
   through various obstacles in the quickest and most efficient manner 
   possible), are searching for another victim. One of the sons sees a 
   woman all alone walking down the street and goes to kidnap her, but a 
   good samaritan hears her screams and intervenes, only to get his 
   throat cut. A Traffic Warden (Ian Sexton) notices Sawney's black cab 
   parked illegally, so he gives it a ticket because he can't see 
   through the blacked-out windows. Sawney then knocks out the traffic 
   cop and puts him in the back seat, honking the horn to tell his son 
   to stop (the woman does not know how lucky she was). The next time we 
   see the Traffic Warden, he is locked in wooden stocks while being 
   butt-fucked by one of the sons. Sawney then cuts off the cop's head 
   with a curved meat knife (nothing is left to the imagination) and 
   tells his son to go feed Mother. Rebecca escapes her shackles (after the<A HREF="sawney_flesh_of_man_2012.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/sawney flesh of man poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="165" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   son takes a bite out of her thigh) and runs for her life, only to be 
   trapped on a cliff by a shotgun-toting Sawney and his two sons. 
   Rebecca decides to take her own life by falling off the cliff (good 
   choice), so Sawney needs a new woman to torture and rape. He kidnaps 
   Wendy (just after she says she loves Hamish over the phone), while 
   Hamish is out at the crime scene trying to find out where the killer 
   is hiding out. A plumber is checking out the mine because a neighbor 
   has been complaining about a foul stench that has been coming through 
   her sewer line for years (for some reason, the sewer line runs 
   through the mine). One of the sons discovers the plumber and knocks 
   him out. Meanwhile, Hamish discovers the hidden waterfall location, 
   but Sawney is waiting for him. How did he know? To say any more would 
   be to ruin the film for you, my dear readers.&nbsp; Capably directed 
   by first-timer Ricky Wood Jr., who co-produced the film with his 
   father, Richard W. Wood (who also wrote the screenplay and created 
   the stomach-turning prosthetics and makeup effects), the movie has a 
   lush feel to it thanks to cinematographer Ranald Wood (Ricky's 
   brother), who used Red cameras to film it. It took them nearly two 
   years to finish the film because they all had regular jobs and filmed 
   mostly on weekends and whatever free time they had. The only real 
   noticable way you can discern this is by the stubble on Samuel 
   Feeney's face. If you look closely, you can see it change length from 
   stot-to-shot. Otherwise this is a terrific first effort by a family 
   dedicated to turning out a quality film. The acting is excellent 
   across the board and the gory effects push way beyond the film's 
   R-Rating. The film is literally full of dismembered body parts, guts 
   and blood and some of the sequences even made this jaded gore junkie 
   stand up and take notice. Toss in a dwarf cannibal, a talking severed 
   head, the unmasking of &quot;Mother&quot; and a surprise reveal 
   during the finale and what you end up with is a gory, glossy horror 
   flick, the kind they use to make a long time ago. The only thing that 
   bothered me was the unnecessary nihilistic ending, but I suppose that 
   Wood will be directing a sequel sometime in the future and the 
   closing shot leaves him room to do so. Other films that deal with the 
   Sawney Bean story are <B><A HREF="blood_clan_1990.htm">BLOOD CLAN</A></B>

   During the 70's, the Spaniards proved just as adept as the Italians 
   at churning out gore-filled horror films that the U.S. was unable or 
   just flat-out didn't want to make in fear of the censors. Well, the

   the title <B><A HREF="when_the_screaming_stops_1973.htm">WHEN THE

   nudity was removed, making the film nothing but a shell of its former 
   self. Which is why I miss DVD company Deimos Entertainment, who 
   released many of these films in their original uncensored versions, 
   making us appreciate the films that we originally saw heavily edited 
   in theaters or even more cut on TV (some so heavily cut, they made no 
   sense at all!). When Deimos ceased operations, no one seemed to pick

   in Italian giallo or Poliziottesco films), Code Red, Scorpion

   and Synapse Films. So, if your tastes run towards 70's Spanish gore 
   film (like mine does), keep searching for Deimos Entertainment DVDs

    VAMPIRES NIGHT ORGY</A></B> - 1972; and don't ask me to explain why 
   her name is spelled differently from the film's title) who, for some 
   reason, is very interested in the funeral. When Carl starts shoveling 
   dirt on his dead fiance&eacute;'s coffin before the preacher is done 
   with his service (I'm still puzzled about that one), Lorelei gestures 
   to her man-servant Alberic (Luis Barboo; <B><A HREF="demons_1973.htm">THE
    DEMONS</A></B> - 1973) to drive away. At the local bar (where beer 
   is still served in steins), the town's coroner (Sergio 
   Mendiz&aacute;bal) tells the Mayor (Luis Induni; <B><A HREF="devils_possessed_1974.htm">THE
    DEVIL'S POSSESSED</A></B> - 1974)&nbsp; and every other patron at 
   the bar of the unusual wounds on the young woman's body. For one, her 
   heart was missing (One drunk patron says. &quot;It must have been a 
   bear that did it!&quot;), but a violin-playing blind vagabond 
   (Francisco Nieto; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#CutThroatsNine1971">CUT-THROATS
    NINE</A></B> - 1971) tells the crowd about a story he heard when he 
   was a child: &quot;According to the traditions of the Seven Full 
   Moons, Lorelei will be transformed into an obscene beast. She will 
   need to devour human hearts in order to return to her centuries-old 
   dream.&quot; Everyone but the Mayor become scared, but a Professor 
   (&Aacute;ngel Men&eacute;ndez), who is stealthily listening to the 
   story on the stairs seems a little more than interested in the 
   legend. To calm the men down, the Mayor buys everyone a round of beer 
   (because beer solves every problem until you wake up with a 
   hangover). A woman named Elke Ackerman (Silvia Tortosa; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Brother Space">BROTHER
    FROM SPACE</A></B> - 1984), a professor at a local all-girls school, 
   enters the bar and tells the Mayor that her school will need 
   protection from the killer (the blind vagabond agrees). The Mayor 
   assures her that there's nothing to worry about because he will be 
   hiring noted hunter Sigurd (Tony Kendall; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BigBustOut">THE
    BIG BUST-OUT</A></B> - 1972) to protect the school and there is no 
   one better. Carl tells the Mayor that Sigurd will not be needed, 
   because he will kill who or what is responsible himself (These things 
   never turn out well). We then meet all the bikini-clad girls at the 
   school as they are frolicking around the school's pool. They are 
   expecting Sigurd to be an old, grizzled hunter, but they are 
   surprised to find out he is a handsome man, as he arrives at the 
   school on his motorcycle and they run away to get all dolled up. 
   Sigurd has been a hunter since he was eleven years-old and he only 
   has two rules that the school's Principal (Josefina Jartin) must 
   follow: First, all doors and windows must be locked at 9:00 pm every 
   night with no one arriving or leaving after that time. Secondly, he 
   must have full liberty to do what he pleases at the school. Elke is 
   against Sigurd being at the school because she believes a man on the 
   property will interrupt her students' learning abilities (She's more 
   concerned about learning than her students' lives?), but the 
   Principal hands him the keys to all the doors and tells Elke to take 
   a chill pill. The girls come back all dolled up, proving Elke's 
   claims and she does win one victory by making Sigurd stay in the 
   garage away from all the girls (She really has problems with men, 
   even though she's not a lesbian). The creature attacks a female 
   student that night when she forgets to lock one of the doors (Her 
   attack is quite brutal and gory, as the creature rips open one of her 
   breasts and leaves huge gashes on her face). When her body is found 
   with her heart missing, Sigurd notices Lorelei at her funeral in her 
   buggy, but it drives away before anyone else can see her. It's quite 
   obvious by now (even without the film's title) that Lorelei is the 
   creature and when Sigurd stops her from attacking the school that 
   night, she goes into town (for the first time in history) and attacks 
   the blind vagabond, ripping out his heart (nothing is left to the 
   imagination). While swimming at the lake (Elke forbades him from 
   swimming in the pool with the girls. What the fuck is her problem?), 
   he sees Lorelei wearing a black-tassled bikini, but once again she 
   disappears. Sigurd meets the Professor, who takes him to his 
   laboratory and tells him that the legend of the Lorelei is true. To 
   prove it, he pulls out a severed hand from a human corpse and injects 
   it with a serum that turns the hand back to the time when creatures 
   like Lorelei existed, the hand turning into a creature's claw. He 
   tells Sigurd that Lorelei must collects seven hearts for the next 
   seven moons to remain immortal, but he has invented a radioactive 
   dagger that will reverse Lorelei's transformation, turning her into 
   nothing but a pile of dust, since she has been alive for centuries. 
   To prove it, he stabs the severed creature's claw he created and it 
   turns back into a human hand (it doesn't turn into dust because it is 
   only a few days old). We finally find out why Elke distrusts Sigurd 
   so much. She believes that the female of the species is superior, but 
   Sigurd's charms soften her so much that she begins falling in love 
   with him. Carl becomes the fourth victim when the creature rips his 
   heart out (again, very graphic) and Sigurd is absolutely sure that 
   Lorelei lives somewhere near the lake. He meets her at an abandoned 
   building by the lake and kisses her (something she has never 
   experienced before and she likes it), but when he begins to try to 
   make love to her and her pearl necklace falls off, Alberic appears 
   and carries her into the water of the lake until they disappear. 
   Sigurd is now sure that Lorelei lives in a cavern beneath the lake 
   and has lived there for centuries. Thanks to Sigurd's big mouth while 
   they were kissing, Lorelei and Alberic pay the Professor a visit . 
   While Lorelei burns all his notes, Alberic whips the Professor until 
   he falls on the floor and a bottle of acid spills on his face, 
   killing him. When the Mayor and Sigurd discover the blind vagabond 
   and the Professor dead (both their hearts missing), Sigurd grabs the 
   Professor's radioactive dagger and has a good idea where Lorelei 
   spends most of her time. Before he goes to her place of residence, 
   the creature attacks a couple of female students having some fun 
   bubble bath action, but Sigurd saves them. The creature dives out the 
   window and Sigurd gets off a couple of shots, but misses. When the 
   creature sees Elke and Sigurd kissing, she becomes jealous and 
   decides to make Elke her next and final victim (Wait a minute, 
   doesn't that make six heartless victims? Doesn't she need one more?). 
   The creature attacks Elke, but Sigurd intervenes. With a boatman and 
   the Mayor waiting above in a small boat, Sigurd dives <A HREF="loreleys_grasp_1973_horror_rises_from_the_tomb_1972_dvd.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/loreley's grasp dvd front10 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="213" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>down
    into the lake's water and discovers the lake's centuries-old cavern, 
   where there are a few pretty evil girls and Alberic waiting for him. 
   Lorelei tells them to get away from him and she shows him all the 
   opulent treasure she has collected over the centuries. There is 
   enough treasure there to buy a big country (The Niebelungen Mythology 
   also gets a mention here). Lorelei wants Sigurd to stay with her 
   &quot;throughout eternity&quot;, but when her hypnosis fails to sway 
   him, she uses every bit of power she has to knock him out and then 
   goes out to collect her final heart. She transforms into the creature 
   (time-lapse photography) and leaves the cavern. Sigurd wakes up tied 
   to some posts, while Lorelei's girls fight over who is going to have 
   him first. He manages to break free, grabs the radioactive dagger and 
   meets the Mayor and the boatman at the boat. He throws a timed charge 
   at the entrance of the underwater cavern and returns to the school, 
   where he knows Lorelei wants to remove Elke's heart and then live for 
   more centuries until she has to do it again. Sigurd manages to stab 
   the creature Lorelei a couple of times in the heart with the 
   radioactive dagger and she dies in his arms, as she turns back to 
   human and then a skeleton and then to dust (The underwater cavern 
   also explodes, killing Lorelei's girls and Alberic in the cave-in). 
   But Sigurd sees a ghostly apparition of Lorelei riding a horse in the 
   distance (shown solarized on the screen), telling him that she will 
   meet him again in another lifetime. It seems that you cannot actually 
   kill Lorelei, but only put an end to her terror until the next time 
   she needs to collect seven human hearts. Isn't love grand?&nbsp; Shot

   (1987) -</B> This is one of the last films directed by the 
   still-living (at the time of this review) Roberta Findlay and, while 
   watching it, it was easy to see why. Her heart just wasn't in it 
   anymore. Findlay was one of the sexploitation godmothers of the 60's, 
   working closely with husband Michael Findlay (who was accidentally 
   killed in 1977 on the top of the-then Pan Am Building in New York 
   City, when the helicopter he was about to travel in collapsed, 
   decapitating him and killing four more people), usually acting under 
   the name &quot;Anna Riva&quot;, producing, writing and photographing 
   films under various male pseudonyms (such as &quot;Robert W. 
   Norman&quot;, &quot;Robert Walters&quot;, &quot;Harold Hindgrind&quot;
    and nearly 20 more!) and generally was a jill-of-all-trades when it 
   came to making sexploitation films. When the sexploitation market 
   dried-up, both Michael and Roberta began making hardcore porn films, 
   but they are probably best kown in the 70's as being the people 
   behind the controversial film <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Snuff">SNUFF</A></B> 
   (1976), which was actually a Findlay film called <B><A HREF="slaughter_1971.htm">THE

   didn't take off theatrically, but legendary film huckster Alan 
   Shackleton took that unpopular film and hired Simon Nuctern (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Silent Madness">SILENT
    MADNESS</A></B> - 1984) to direct a tacked-on ending purportedly 
   showing an actress actually getting killed on screen and a legend was 
   born. The brew-ha-ha that it caused, which included people picketing 
   at theaters showing it and the F.B.I. investigating the allegations, 
   made the film a smash hit, but the Findlays never saw a penny of 
   profit from it because they sold their original film outright to 
   Shackleton. When Michael died, Roberta continued making porn films 
   and then, starting in the mid-80's began directing and photographing 
   a series of exploitation and horror films, which included the 
   superior <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Tenement">TENEMENT: GAME OF SURVIVAL</A></B>

   (1988); the rarely-seen <B><A HREF="banned_1989.htm">BANNED</A></B> 
   (1989); and this film. While this is not a bad film (it is 
   competently acted, photographed and has a few genuine scares), it was 
   obvious that Roberta Fildlay was working on auto-pilot when she 
   directed this. Even more disappointing is that the &quot;blah&quot; 
   screenplay was co-written by Ed Kelleher (with Harriette Vidal), who 
   also co-wrote the memorable cult films <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Invasion Blood Farm">INVASION
    OF THE BLOOD FARMERS</A></B> (1972) and <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Shriek Mutilated">SHRIEK
    OF THE MUTILATED</A></B> (1974; directed by Michael Findlay). The 
   idea behind the film is very interesting, but the execution leaves a 
   lot to be desired. I consider this a reverse version of <B><A HREF="sentinel_1977.htm">THE
    SENTINEL</A></B> (1977) and as you read my review, you will soon 
   understand why. This movie is about cellist Cathy (Christine Moore), 
   who is going through a lot of shit. When she was just a young girl 
   (played by Dana Nardelli) living in a brownstone in Washington 
   Heights, New York, her cruel mother would abuse her (like burning her 
   with a hot iron!) and telling her constantly &quot;They are going to 
   get you!&quot; One day after abuse from her mother, Cathy walks down 
   the many floors of the brownstone by using the spiral staircase-like 
   steps crying her eyes out. When she goes outside, two girls ask if 
   she wants to jump rope. When she does, her neck gets tangled in the 
   ropes and the two girls pull the rope tightly, the two girls under 
   the control of a ghostly girl dressed in white (Lauren Ruave). It 
   seems Cathy has an unnamed female guardian angel (Eva Baumann), 
   because just as Cathy is about to lose consciousness, she makes the 
   ghost girl disappear and the two girls let go of the rope. That 
   night, while Cathy is under the covers of her bed reading a book with 
   a flashlight, she hears strange voices calling her name. She flips 
   the covers open and discovers a wide assortment of human-like 
   creatures called Lurkers (excellent make-up effects by Ed French of <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Breeders1986">BREEDERS</A></B> 
   [1986] fame) floating around her bed. We then cut to the present, 
   where Cathy is a successful cellist in a string quartet. We see her 
   walking across the street to meet her fianc&eacute; Bob (Gary 
   Warner), when a cab comes barreling down the road. Just before the 
   cab hits her, the guardian angel from earlier in the film (who hasn't 
   aged a year) pulls her back and saves her from certain death. When 
   Cathy mentions to Bob that if it weren't for the woman she would be 
   dead, Bob says, &quot;What woman?&quot; Cathy and Bob are soon to be 
   married and he wants Cathy to invite her only living relative, 
   brother Phil (Gil Newsom), who is a priest, to the wedding, but Cathy 
   says she hasn't spoken to him in years and refuses to talk to Bob 
   what happened to make them become estranged. Bob is the co-owner of a 
   modeling agency with beautiful partner Monica (Marina Taylor) and he 
   hands photos of Cathy to her, which makes Monica very interested in 
   something (While this is happening, two models, one of them portrayed 
   by Ruth Collins [<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Doom Asylum">DOOM ASYLUM</A></B> 
   - 1987], are off to the side stripping topless while talking about 
   junk bonds and insider trading!). We then see Cathy playing cello in 
   a recording studio with her string quartet, when the ghostly girl in 
   white pops-up in one of the booths, causing Cathy to scream and run 
   out of the studio (No one else sees her, as the studio engineer asks, 
   &quot;Is that a wrap?&quot;). Director Findlay show her roots in 
   sexploitation when we see Bob and Cathy nude in bed making love. 
   Cathy has a nightmare flashback where she witnesses her mother 
   brutally kill her father by stabbing him in the chest with a butcher 
   knife (the blood literally squirts out of the wound), with Mom then 
   chasing a young Cathy down the street, but before dear Mother can 
   kill her, Cathy wakes up. In the film's most telling, yet mysterious 
   sequence (it will be explained later in the film), Bob meets a 
   nervous Steve (Peter Oliver-Norman) in a bar, where Steve says to 
   Bob, &quot;I can't do it any more!&quot;, but Bob says he made a deal 
   with &quot;them&quot; and he has to follow through with the deal or 
   suffer the consequences. Bob leaves the bar and Steve collapses, as 
   if he is having a nervous breakdown. Cathy goes to see psychic friend 
   Rita (Nancy Groff) for a Tarot Card reading and a card comes up that 
   doesn't bode so well for Cathy, but Rita lies and says she and Bob 
   will have a happy life together. Cathy then goes to meet her brother 
   Phil at the steps of his church to invite him to the wedding, but 
   Phil is very unreceptive and turns down her invitation, telling her 
   to get some professional help. As Phil walks into the church, Cathy 
   sees the ghostly girl, who tells her, &quot;Go home Cathy!&quot;, 
   which triggers another nightmare flashback. This time we see Cathy's 
   mother being taken out of the brownstone, a huge butcher knife buried 
   in her chest, while her dying abusive mother tells her, &quot;Go home 
   Cathy!&quot; Is there something mentally wrong with Cathy or are 
   there more sinister forces at work (Bet on the latter)? Why was Steve 
   carried away in a straitjacket after his discussion with Bob? What 
   exactly are Lurkers? Are they real or a figment of Cathy's twisted 
   mind? Where did I put my pants? The pieces start falling together (I 
   still haven't found my pants, though) when Bob takes Cathy to a 
   party, but first Cathy makes Bob stop the car to pick up her guardian 
   angel, who is standing at the curb of a street. This time Bob can see 
   her and the guardian angel says, &quot;Don't go home Cathy!&quot; and 
   disappears into thin air (Bob tells Cathy that she probably jumped 
   out of the convertible!). Once they reach the party location, Cathy 
   realizes that it is the Washington Heights brownstone where she was 
   raised as a child and refuses to go inside. Bob tells Cathy to wait 
   outside while he makes excuses to the host, Desmond (Roy MacArthur), 
   as to why they cannot stay. Bob seems to be taking an awfully long 
   time upstairs, as Cathy witnesses a bloody girl running by her with 
   Leo 'The Hammer' (Thomas Billett) chasing her, sledgehammer in hand, 
   Steve on the ground pleading for God to forgive him, a dead chicken 
   hanging upside down on on a cemetery gate and Leo crushing the poor 
   bloodied girl's head in with the sledgehammer, all while trying to 
   find a working payphone to call for help (even today, that is an 
   impossibility in New York City!). With a little prying from Bob, he 
   gets Cathy to enter the brownstone and attend the party, telling her 
   she can use the phone in there to call for help. It all turns out to 
   be a trap for Cathy, as the brownstone Cathy lived in as a child is 
   actually a gateway from Hell to let &quot;Lurkers&quot; walk the 
   Earth, as long as they get someone to take their own lives. Everyone 
   at the party that Cathy thought were her friends are all actually 
   Lurkers <A HREF="lurkers_1987_die_sister_die_1976_dvd.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/lurkers-die sister die reverse cover dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="213" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(She
    sees a repentant Steve at the party, where Desmond says to him, 
   &quot;Really Steve, you're such a worthless fuck!&quot; before Leo 
   pummels Steve to a bloody pulp for not bringing a close relative with 
   him to sacrifice to the Devil). Bob (who is also a Lurker) must try 
   to convince Cathy to commit suicide, so all the Lurkers shed their 
   human skins and show their actual selves (it's not a pretty sight). 
   It seems that when Cathy was a child and that jump rope was around 
   her neck, she was supposed to die, and Satan is nothing if not a good 
   bookkeeper, so Cathy must take her life to balance the books. Bob 
   also tells Cathy that everyone who dies in that brownstone 
   automatically goes to Hell and also says that there are buildings 
   like this spread throughout the world. Cathy runs to the roof of the 
   brownstone, where the Lurkers trick Cathy and she falls off the roof 
   and dies. The next time we see Bob, he has a new fiance&eacute;, who 
   tells him that when she was a child, she lived in a strange 
   brownstone full of creepy creatures which would come to her bedroom 
   at night. The cycle continues........&nbsp; If I make this film sound 
   interesting, my apologies. It is so leisurely-paced, a snail could 
   beat it in a footrace. The actual Lurkers come few and far between, 
   once at the beginning and once at the end, so the rest of the film is 
   nothing but Cathy acting scared while we try to figure out what in 
   the Hell (pardon the pun) is going on. I'm still scratching my head 
   about Phil the priest. We never see him as a boy during Cathy's 
   frequent childhood flashbacks, so where the hell was he? At Seminary 
   School? And why does he refuse to help his sister? He is a priest, 
   for Christ's sake (pardon that pun, too, but I have to find something 
   funny to say to relieve the 85 minutes of boredom I just witnessed). 
   Besides the excellent makeup effects by Ed French, there is really 
   nothing to offer the viewer in way of entertainment. The Lurkers are 
   definitely creepy and their first appearance does raise some 
   goosebumps, but they are used so sparingly, it hardly makes up for 
   the other 84 minutes of soap opera-like story. Roberta Findlay 
   definitely knows how to film scenes for optimum effect and the music 
   (by producer Walter E. Sear, who also co-edited the film with 
   Findlay), although electronic, sounds harpsicord-heavy and is 
   effective during the few scare scenes. Some secondary things in the 
   movie did tickle my funnybone, though, like Bob and Cathy eating at 
   Fiorello's Cafe, a joint I used to eat lunch at often when I worked 
   in NYC; Cathy reading the book &quot;Prisoners Of Childhood&quot; 
   while taking a bath (talk about prophetic!); and a parking garage 
   only charging $5.26 for the night! Try finding parking for quadruple 
   that in any parking garage in NYC now and you'll be lucky! Originally

    MAD</A><A NAME="Mad2006"></A> (2006) -</B> When I read the plot 
   synopsis on the DVD sleeve, all I could think was, &quot;Oh great, 
   another zombie comedy!&quot; (Insert sarcasm here). But, much to my 
   surprise, this one is at least worth a rental. The plot is rather 
   simple: Slaughterhouse owner Arlen Sutter (Ian McPhail) supplies beef 
   to the local diner that is intentionally infected with a Mad Cow-like 
   disease, which turns the patrons that eat it into flesh-eating 
   zombies. A visiting tourist family, which includes dad Jason Hunt 
   (Billy Zane; <B><A HREF="dead_calm_1989.htm">DEAD CALM</A></B> - 
   1989; <B><A HREF="tales_from_the_crypt_demon_knight_1995.htm">TALES 
   FROM THE CRYPT: DEMON KNIGHT</A></B> -1995); his girlfriend Monica 
   (Shauna MacDonald), who insists on dressing Jason in retro 80's 
   fashions (because it makes her hot!); teenage daughter Amy (Maggie 
   Castle), who hates Monica for what she's turning her father into; and Am<A HREF="mad_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mad 2006 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="195" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>y's
    bubble-headed boyfriend Blake (Evan Charles Flock), decide to spend 
   the day (and night) in the town, unaware of the horror they are about 
   to encounter. While having a meal in the diner, Monica is killed by 
   an infected townie and Blake has some of his toes bitten off by 
   another zombie, forcing Jason, Amy and an infected Blake to team-up 
   with waitress Steve (Jordan Madley) and cook Charlie (Rothaford Gray) 
   and barricade themselves in the diner. Jason (who once played synth 
   drums in an 80's New Wave band incredulously called &quot;The 
   Mad&quot;) is a doctor and performs a makeshift autopsy on Monica's 
   corpse to try and pinpoint the reason for the sudden outbreak of 
   zombieism. He accidentally discovers that there is something wrong 
   with the beef when the last infected hamburger patty springs to life 
   and attacks Blake, attaching itself to Blake's face (Jason removes it 
   by pouring olive oil on Blake's face, to which Blake exclaims, 
   &quot;Oh great, now my face is going to break out!&quot;). Blake is 
   decapitated by the zombie horde (a funny scene) and both Steve and 
   Charlie are devoured, too, but Jason and Amy hop in a car and 
   hightail it out of town. Incredibly, they turn around to combat the 
   root of the problem (Jason looks at his daughter and says, &quot;Damn 
   it, Amy. I'm not a doctor, I'm a musician!&quot; What?) and head to 
   the Sutter farm, where they meet Arlen's strange son Johnny (Matthew 
   Deslippe). Jason and Amy find out a little too late that both Sutters 
   are infected with the disease and resort to cannibalism to keep the 
   condition under control (they are somewhere between human and 
   full-blown zombies). Can vegetarian Amy charm the pants off Johnny 
   before Arlen and a barn-full of living chopped beef devour 
   Jason?&nbsp; The first thing you'll notice about this film, directed 
   by Johnny Kalangis (whose only other directorial credits are a couple 
   of romantic dramas) and co-written by Kalangis, Kevin Hennelly and 
   Christopher Warre Smets, is how fast and loose it plays with the 
   characters' lives. We are led to believe that there is going to be a 
   lot of personal drama between Amy and Monica, only to have Monica be 
   the first on-screen casualty. The same can be said about Steve and 
   Charlie, who are both given interesting back-stories, only to be 
   unceremoniously killed in a quick fashion. The entire film is played 
   rather broadly, with tongue firmly planted in cheek, and while not 
   everything works (some of it is groan-inducing), there's a lot here 
   that manages to raise a chuckle, including Billy Zane's entire 
   performance, some extreme gore (most of it used humorously) and some 
   good one-liners (&quot;Has your beef been acting strangely?&quot;). 
   Not everyone is going to like <B><A HREF="mad_2006b.htm">THE MAD</A></B>,
    because everything is treated as a joke and nothing is taken 
   seriously (some of the dialogue between Jason and Amy later in the 
   film is downright surreal), but, at 82 minutes long, it doesn't 
   overstay it's welcome and is a pretty entertaining flick if you're in 
   the right frame of mind. Nothing spectacular, mind you, but a nice 
   diversion. Also starring Christopher Gross and Angela Maiorano. A 
   Peace Arch Entertainment DVD Release. <B>Unrated</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

   (1968/1969) -</B> This is the middle film of the infamous &quot;Blood 
   Island Trilogy&quot; (the first one being <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Brides Of Blood">BRIDES

   finished in the final film <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BeastOfBlood1970">BEAST

   and <A HREF="http://www.oldies.com">Alpha New Cinema</A> just ported 
   over the Image versions for their much cheaper (and missing some 
   extras) DVD-Rs, but the fullscreen print is in fine condition. Until 
   someone takes a chance and releases all three Blood Island films in 
   widescreen, these discs will have to do. And they do <A HREF="mad_doctor_of_blood_island_1969.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mad doctor of blood island poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="306" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>contain
    the interesting Blood Island Trilogy trailers, one of them 
   narrarated by the unmistakable Brother Theodore, who sounds like he 
   is about to have a seizure while narrating it (I loved that guy!). 
   For such a low price (5 DVDs for $17.99), how could you pass up such 
   a deal from Alpha Video? We all know that John Ashley starred in all 
   three of these films and loved the Philippines so much, he stayed 
   there for a long period of time, acting in such classic Filipino 
   genre films as <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Beast Yellow Night">BEAST

   and he did more than any American to promote films made in the 
   Philippines during the 70's (Well, him and Roger Corman). He then 
   returned to the United States and mostly gave up acting, instead 
   becoming a Producer of popular TV shows as <B><A HREF="a_team_tv_series_1983-1987.htm">THE
    A-TEAM</A></B> (1983 - 1987); <B><A HREF="werewolf_tv_series_1987.htm">WEREWOLF</A></B> 
   (1987 - 1988; I know it has a bad reputation in certain circles, but

    IS OUT THERE</A></B> (1988), which became a short-lived series the 
   same year. If a heart attack didn't take John Ashley at the 
   relatively young age of 62 in 1997, imagine all the stories he could 
   tell us about his time spent in the Philippines (Such as his nude 
   lovemaking scene with Angelique Pettyjohn in this film was real. She 
   has gone on record saying it was!). He was a great-looking guy (I'm 
   manly enough to say that) and must have had some real tales to tell, 
   as well as film-related information. Too bad he passed away the year 
   DVD was just hitting the market. But enough about the legendary 
   Ashley. Let's get to the film itself. When the film was first 
   released to theaters, it handed out all the patrons with a vial of 
   &quot;green blood&quot; (actually water with green food coloring) and 
   this DVD has that seqment where the audience had to take the &quot;<A HREF="mad_doctor_of_blood_island_1969-1969b.htm">Oath
    of the Green Blood</A>&quot;: &quot;I, a living, breathing creature 
   of the cosmic entity, am now ready to enter the realm of those chosen 
   to be allowed to drink the Mystic Emerald fluids herein offered. I 
   join the Order of Green Blood with an open mind and, through this 
   liquid's powers, am now prepared to safely view the unnatural 
   green-blooded ones without fear of contamination.&quot; After taking 
   that Oath, you were guaranteed never to turn into a green-blooded 
   monster (William Castle must have been proud). We are then taken to a 
   lush jungle where a totally nude girl is running for her life from a 
   green, icky monster, which we will call the &quot;chlorophyll 
   monster&quot; (giving away the monster appearance in the film's first 
   five minutes, but it doesn't hurt the film in the least). The 
   chlorophyll monster catches the girl and makes mincemeat of her face 
   (also letting us see some rather gruesome gore for 1969), as we watch 
   the water flowing down the waterfalls turn green while the opening 
   titles are shown on screen. We are then transported to a ship heading 
   for Blood Island. The passengers include Dr. Bill Foster (John 
   Ashley), a pathologist sent to the island to check out some rumors 
   that have spread from there concerning chlorophyll experiments; 
   Sheila Willard (Angelique Pettyjohn; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Biohazard 1984">BIOHAZARD</A></B> 
   - 1984; who ventured into porn films during the mid-70's), who is 
   looking for her father Willard (Tony Edmunds), who Sheila hasn't seen 
   since she was twelve and now he has stopped replying to her letters; 
   Carlos Lopez (Ronaldo Valdez; who has the emotions and acting range 
   of a piece of wood), who has come to try and talk his mother (Tita 
   Mu&ntilde;oz) into leaving the island with him. The Captain of the 
   ship (played by future director Edward D. Murphy; <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#Raw Force">RAW
    FORCE</A></B> - 1981) tells Carlos that he should get his mother off 
   the island because of something that happened to him six months 
   earlier close to the island. They found a man floating on a raft and 
   when he came to, he started acting acting like a total lunatic, even 
   killing one of the Captain's crew. The Captain put a bullet into him 
   and he jumped overboard, but not before leaving puddles of green 
   blood behind (The Captain scraped some of the green blood and sent it 
   to a government laboratory, which is one of the main reasons Bill has 
   come to the island). The Captain thinks the island is cursed. Carlos 
   thinks the Captain is nuts. I'm going with the Captain on this one. 
   The guests are brought to the island by the natives and are welcomed 
   by the village elder, Ramu (Alfonso Carvajal, who will repeat the 
   same role in the third film). Sheila finds out her father Willard has 
   become a blind stinking drunk and Carlos meets his mother, who is 
   working in conjunction with the evil Dr. Lorca (Ronald Remy; <B><A HREF="vampire_people_1964.htm">THE
    VAMPIRE PEOPLE</A></B> - 1964; who would<B> </B>be replaced with 
   actor/director Eddie Garcia in the final film) and Lorca's evil 
   sidekick Razak (Bruno Punzalan). Carlos also meets childhood friend 
   Marla (Alicia Alonzo), who has grown up to be quite a beautiful 
   woman, but she seems to have plans just for herself and uses Carlos 
   as a fucktoy. That night, Sheila hears a noise outside her window and 
   when she opens it, she sees a totally green man with an icky growth 
   on the side of his face. Bill grabs his gun and runs outside, but 
   doesn't catch him. A naked Marla takes a swim in the lake at the foot 
   of the waterfalls while Willard secretly watches (but I get the 
   feeling that Marla knows). Sheila heads out to the jungle alone 
   looking for her father and is nearly bitten by a snake, but Bill 
   notices her missing and goes looking for her. The green chlorophyll 
   monster nearly gets Sheila (during every attack scene, the camera 
   rapidly zooms in and out, inducing nausea in the viewer, but I think 
   it is used [rather badly] to represent danger). A native intervenes 
   and impales it with a spear, but it has no effect and the native 
   loses his life long enough for Sheila to get away. Bill, Willard and 
   a native search party find the grisly remains of the native (pretty 
   graphic for 1968) and then find Sheila, who tells her story. In a 
   scene that reminded me of Wes Craven's <B><A HREF="swamp_thing_1982.htm">SWAMP
    THING</A></B> (1982), everyone is having dinner at a table and Bill 
   asks Dr. Lorca (he's the only one wearing sunglasses inside and 
   sporting white gloves) about what he thought about what happened 
   today. Willard interrupts and says his daughter must have halucinated 
   what she saw (he is obviously trying to save her from Dr. Lorca). The 
   group (minus Mrs. Lopez) go to a native ritual to fight evil where a 
   live goat and pig are sacrificed, but Dr. Lorca knows it will do no 
   good. Whenever Bill tries to use the radio to contact the mainland, 
   something jams the signal. It's obvious Dr. Lorca doesn't want anyone 
   to leave the island. Bill finds the totally green man passed out in 
   the jungle and brings him back to the shack. Dr. Lorca gives him a 
   shot of chlorophyll and tells Bill that when he wakes up to give him 
   some soup! Carlos makes one final plea with his mother to leave the 
   island with him, but she tells him she is a marked woman. The green 
   chlorophyll monster is actually Carlos' father who was dying of 
   leukemia until Dr. Lorca started experimenting on him using 
   chlorophyll. At first his father went back to normal and it looked 
   like he was cured, but then he started changing and needed human 
   blood to stay alive. Dr. Lorca has been using natives in a secret 
   cave laboratory above the waterfalls to experiment and try to perfect 
   his serum. Dr. Lorca says that Carlos' father was dead, so he and 
   Mrs. Lopez became lovers. When Bill and Carlos open his father's 
   tomb, they find his coffin empty, proving that Dr. Lorca is just not 
   evil, he is also a big fat liar. The chlorophyll monster sees his own 
   empty tomb opened and then kills his wife in what best can be 
   described as a butcher's nightmare. He also almost kills<A HREF="mad_doctor_of_blood_island_1969.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mad doctor of blood island dvd8 front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Carlos, but a childhood photo of Carlos falls next to him and the 
   chlorophyll monster decides to let him live. As proof, Carlos finds a 
   letter written by his father three months after he supposedly died. 
   Two natives are making love in the jungle when they are attacked by 
   the chlorophyll monster. He rips off the guy's arm and removes the 
   girl's head, which is more gore than you would usually see in 1968. 
   The mute Razak kills the native guard protecting the green man (he 
   stabs him in the chest, which is very bloody) and, as a chaser, Razak 
   cuts off the green man's head with a machete! Bill is falsely accused 
   of killing the green man, so he and Sheila find the secret cave 
   laboratory above the waterfalls (thanks to Marla, who took him there 
   earlier). Carlos also shows up and so do Dr. Lorca and Razak. Things 
   become disturbing when a cage is found full of Dr. Lorca's 
   still-alive failed experiments. Dr. Lorca tries to reason with Carlos 
   that he has been looking for a cure for his father, but Carlos knows 
   that his father has already spilled too much human blood. Sheila is 
   taken prisoner, but Bill saves her and the laboratory catches on fire 
   (I didn't even mention the plant that moves its limbs like arms and 
   legs and Carlos being held prisoner in a cage!). Bill knocks out both 
   Dr. Lorca and Razak (but doesn't kill them) and rescues Carlos and 
   they leave the cave before it blows up, but we know that in Part 3, 
   both Lorca and Razak survive. Bill, Sheila (without her father, who 
   is still alive, but didn't act like much of a father throughout the 
   film) and Carlos leave the island on the Captain's ship, but there's 
   a little surprise inside the ship's lifeboat that will kick off Part 
   3.&nbsp; Co-directed by &quot;Gerry DeLeon&quot; a.k.a Gerardo de

   but I don't. It's still a good film, though; he passed away in 1981) 
   and Eddie Romero (who passed away in 2013 and directed most of 
   Ashley's films mentioned above), who both also handled the same 
   chores in the first film, fill this film with nudity (there are a lot 
   of bare women's asses, but very few breasts) and some eye-opening 
   gore, which made this a hit for Hemisphere Pictures on it's 
   theatrical release. Besides the headache-inducing in-and-out zoom 
   shots, this film is very entertaining and Eddie Romero would handle 
   the chores alone in the final film, which believe it or not, was 
   Rated PG [GP] and is much more violent than this film. Those who are 
   only used to watching the TV versions should spend the paltry bucks 
   it costs to buy the unedited trilogy because you'll be absolutely 
   surprised at what you were missing. This was a time when PG didn't 
   mean childish things and nudity and copious blood were allowed. These 
   were some of the first films that made American audiences aware there 
   was a Filipino film industry and we have never looked back since. The 
   women were tropical, yet beautiful, their English was fractured, but 
   understandable and they had no problems with showing extreme gore in 
   their films. Only the U.S. censors chopped them up, so get the DVDs 
   and have a party. Originally released on VHS from <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Magnum Entertainmen">Magnum

   whose synopsis is mistakenly listed on the back of the Regal Video

   (Samantha Dark) and her 9 year old daughter (Courtney Bertolone) 
   hostage, stealing their van and beating the other two remaining 
   robbers (a man and his girlfriend) to the abandoned house. He ties up 
   the mother and daughter but the little girl gets loose, running to 
   hide in a nearby abandoned slaughterhouse, where ten years earlier a 
   kidnapped little boy, Martin, was forced to watch some unknown person 
   knife a woman to death. The robber gets knifed to death by some 
   unknown assailant when the other two robbers arrive at the house and

   woman to death in front of the tied-up mother and the other robber 
   comes back, unties the mother and they go looking for her daughter. 
   The pieces start to fall together as the slaughterhouse starts 
   revealing it's secrets as the remaining robber pays for his discovery 
   with his life, but not before saving the mother and her daughter. The 
   killer was Martin, who was being trained by the owner of the closed 
   slaughterhouse on how to become a serial killer.&nbsp; When the 
   police arrive, there are so many bodies in the slaughterhouse that 
   the FBI is called in to help notify the families of all the mutilated 
   bodies. A series of ledgers found in the slaughterhouse detail the 
   killings by the owner, how he trained Martin and that he knows Martin 
   will kill him next. Martin's body is never found and the final coda 
   will send a chill down your spine. Obviously shot on a shoestring 
   budget (but on film and not video), one-man wonder Stevan Mena 
   directed, produced, wrote, edited and did the music for this 
   atmospheric horror film which actually jolts the viewer with some 
   real scares, uses mainly unknown actors to good advantage and gets 
   plenty of mileage out of his limited locations. It actually got a 
   small <A HREF="malevolence_ad_mat_2004.htm">theatrical release</A> 
   before coming to DVD. Rent or buy it if you like to be scared late at 
   night with the lights out. While not overtly bloody, it contains many 
   disturbing images (including a man-made Cow-Man skeleton which has to 
   be seen to be believed) and will not please anyone who dislikes 
   knives. I liked this one a lot and it does not contain one bit of 
   humor. Kind of refreshing for a horror film these days. Also starring 
   Brandon Johnson, Heather Magee, Keith Chambers, Richard Glover and 
   John Richard Ingram as the cop who discovers the mess. Director

   Baron von Weser (Cameron Mitchell, who is horrendously dubbed by 
   someone with a British accent) reluctantly accepts a group of upper 
   class tourists to his remote island villa because he needs their 
   money to continue his illicit experiments. One of the tourists, 
   Professor Julius Demerest (Herman Nelsen), immediately notices on the 
   car ride to the villa that the island is full of plant life not 
   indigenous to the area. The car also hits one of the Baron's 
   horribly-scarred servants when he darts out in front of it, killing 
   him (the Professor seems to believe he died of fright, though).

   Baron shows off his collection of carnivorous plants he has created 
   and feeds a mouse to one of them (Professor Demerest says, &quot;It's 
   better than a <A HREF="maneater_of_hydra_1966.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/maneater of hydra-house that screamed dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>cat!&quot;).
    David Moss (George Martin) smells a rat and warns new love interest 
   Beth (Elisa Mantes) to play it safe and lock her bedroom door at 
   night. He's right, of course, as members of the group (beginning with 
   the gigolo limo driver) start getting mysteriously murdered, their 
   bodies drained of blood. Some members of the group believe it to be 
   the work of a vampire and they are partly right. The Baron has 
   created a carnivouous tree that needs blood to survive and when the 
   Baron doesn't get the red stuff to it promptly, it uproots itself and 
   goes searching for some on it's own. As the tourists start turning on 
   each other, the phone lines dead and the ferry not due back for two 
   days, you would think that they would stick together for safety, 
   right? Wrong. Professor Demerest is killed by the Baron (with a spike 
   hidden in a statue) when he gets too close to the truth. During a 
   heavy thunderstorm, the carnivorous tree kills Mrs. Callahan (Matilde 
   Sampedro) and attacks Beth, so David springs into action and begins 
   pruning the tree with an axe (it spurts gallons of blood). The Baron 
   goes bonkers and attacks David (they get into an axe fight) and the 
   Baron offers his own blood to the tree, kind of a human/tree 
   transfusion. The tree takes too much and the Baron falls victim to 
   his own creation. It ain't pretty.&nbsp; This Spanish/German 
   co-production, directed by genre vet Mel Welles (star of such films

   unfortunately, the print used for the DVD from Shout! Factory (as 
   part of their &quot;Elvira Movie Macabre&quot; series) is a terribly 
   soft fullframe speckled mess that's full of drop-outs, emulsion 
   scratches and jitter. It's also obvious that it's a TV print 
   (although it appears to be uncut), as every ten minutes the film 
   fades to black. If you've never seen this film before, it's a pretty 
   decent mystery/horror film with some fluid camerawork, atmosphere and 
   a few good scares. But the craptacular dubbing, especially for

   The middle of the film also drags a bit and the screenplay, by 
   Stephen Schmidt (the story is co-credited to Ernst R. von Theumer, 
   who would later direct <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BigBustOut">THE 
   BIG BUST-OUT</A></B> [1972], <B><A HREF="action.htm#JungleWarriors">JUNGLE

   never resolved. The final reveal of the Baron's giant blood-sucking 
   tree and the (literal) shower of blood are a hoot, though (there's 
   also the gory visage of the after-effects of an axe murder). Too bad 
   that this presentation is such a let-down. Since this seems to be the 
   only legal U.S. version available, it will have to do for now, but 
   some enterprising distributor should find a widescreen version and

   (2001) - </B>This is a wonderful comedy/horror film about two serial 
   killers who fall in love and try to live a normal life. Have I got 
   your attention? Good. Joe Spinelli (Jeff Fahey), known as the 
   &quot;Blueblood Killer&quot; because he only kills doctors, lawyers 
   and bankers, is captured and sent to Edgemare Sanitarium for the 
   Criminally Insane in Arizona. He is a shy, introverted person (but 
   still a killer) who has trouble fitting into the institution, where 
   the guards are rough, the matron (Leslie Easterbrook) brutal and the 
   politics corrupt. When Joe meets fellow inmate Beth (Kellie Waymire), 
   a serial killer who thinks she comes from royal ancestry, he begins 
   to open up. He puts on little acts like crucifying himself on a cross 
   and slitting his stomach (both fake) to impress her. She falls for 
   him and he for her. When he asks her how she had the strength to kill<A HREF="maniacts_2001.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/maniacts dvd front small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="138" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   all those people she shows him in a game of arm wrestling, where she 
   demonstrates that she becomes almost superhuman when someone hits her 
   or gets her physically excited (she's been physically and sexually 
   abused all her life). Joe and Beth are befriended by asylum trustee 
   Mason (Mel Winkler), who helps them escape, but before they do they 
   have some housekeeping to attend to. Beth crushes the matron's head 
   with a high-pressure water hose (a graphic effect) while Joe impales 
   the head doctor (Bob Bancroft, who looks and acts like Andy Dick) on 
   a flagpole (to comic effect). Joe and Beth escape to the farm of 
   kindly and psychic Mr. Boley (John Furlong), who says that he was 
   expecting them for a long time as he saw them in a dream. Boley 
   treats them like they were his own children and they live as one 
   happy family. One outrageously funny scene is when Beth discovers 
   that Joe is a virgin and makes love to him for the first time. Since 
   Beth gets super strong when her adrenaline increases this makes for 
   one noisy and hurtful lovemaking session, but Joe doesn't care. 
   Things come to a boil when a sleazy realtor comes calling and wants 
   to buy the farm. Boley refuses to sell and the realtor comes back 
   with a bunch of punks to force them off. A bloody fight ensues (hands 
   are chopped off, a scythe is run-through another's stomach) and Boley 
   gets shot. Before he dies, Boley gives Joe and Beth the farm. They 
   live happily until Beth finds out that the Queen of England is coming 
   to Arizona for a special tribute to the London Bridge. Beth wants to 
   meet the Queen since she believes that she comes from royalty. Joe 
   reluctantly agrees and they head off to the tribute. The finale shows 
   Joe making the ultimate (and heartbreaking) sacrifice while Beth has 
   a surprise of her own. Director/writer C.W. Cressler has crafted a 
   film that works on many levels. It is an indictment against corporate 
   greed, a love story about two people who have never experienced love 
   before and an absurb comedy which pokes holes at the little things we 
   take for granted. The film is told in chapters, which explains what 
   the title of the film really means. Jeff Fahey (<B><A HREF="body_parts_1991.htm">BODY
    PARTS</A></B> - 1991) has never been better here and now can be 
   forgiven for some of his more <A HREF="jeff_fahey_crappy_films.htm">recent
    film choices</A>. Kellie Waymire, who worked with Fahey on the 
   short-lived 2001 TV series <B><A HREF="wolf_lake_tv_series_2001.htm">WOLF
    LAKE</A></B>, is a wonder, displaying a range of emotions and 
   delivering her lines (such as: &quot;It's gotta be OK to kill people. 
   Carmakers do it, doctors do it, governments do it all the time.&quot;)
    with such aplomb that it still brings a smile to my face. She died 
   late in 2003 of a heart attack at the age of 36. A real loss for the 
   film community. John Furlong (a regular player in most of the late 
   Russ Meyer's films) is also excellent and has quite a few memorable 
   lines. In fact, every thing about this film is memorable, from the 
   oddball characters (including an inmate called Tapeman [Vincent 
   Guastefarro] who believes he invented crime scene tape. Everytime he 
   sees someone getting killed he says, &quot;Ka-ching!&quot;), the set 
   pieces (especially the scene where Boley has put two nails in the 
   wall for pictures) and the death scenes (bloody, cringe-inducing and 
   hilarious). This little low-budget picture is destined to become a 
   sleeper. See it! The film is dedicated to late actor Joe Spinell (<B><A HREF="maniac_1980.htm">MANIAC</A> </B>-

   [1980]. Unfortunately, Lucio comes up with a cropper here, as the 
   plot limps along at a snail's pace and most of it is filmed in such 
   extreme close-up that Tylenol is needed to cure the extreme headache 
   it induces from watching it. Storyline involves an archaeologist 
   (Christopher Connelly) visiting Egypt with his wife (Martha Taylor) 
   and daughter (Brigitta Boccoli). He discovers a tomb of a 5,000 year 
   old demon and is blinded by a carving of a blue eye on the tomb wall. 
   Meanwhile, while mom is away taking photos of Egyptian ruins, the 
   daughter is handed an amulet in the shape of the blue-eyed carving by 
   a blind old hag. Daughter becomes possessed and strange things begin 
   to happen once they move back to their apartment in Manhattan. Cobras 
   and scorpions appear. The apartment security guard dies after falling 
   through the elevator floor. The babysitter disappears. One of mom's 
   co-workers vanishes in a flash of white light with Egyptian sand left 
   in his place. Dad and Mom try to save their daughter. Can they do it? 
   This is practically a goreless exercise except for the last five 
   minutes where an antiques dealer (Cosimo Cinieri) is torn apart by 
   his collection of stuffed birds! Fulci also has a cameo as Dr. 
   Forrester. Can you imagine going to a doctor for help and finding out

    films when I was a kid in the 60's, even if I didn't get the mature 
   subtext. All I cared about were the weird transformation scenes that 
   were etched in my brain during the numerous times I viewed this flick 
   on TV during the 60's &amp; 70's. Now that I have achieved adulthood 
   (some may disagree), I can finally see that this is a crazy morality 
   play about adultery and the monster that resides in all of us (or 
   something like that). The film opens with a gorilla-like creature 
   slaughtering some geisha girls in a Tokyo bathhouse. The creature 
   returns to the laboratory of Dr. Suzuki (Satoshi Nakamura), who we 
   learn has created this creature by injecting his brother with a serum 
   that causes mutations. Dr. Suzuki shoots and kills his brother and 
   throws him into a lava pit conveniently located in his laboratory, 
   which is carved into the side of a volcano. Enter Larry (Peter 
   Dyneley), a reporter who has come to interview Dr. Suzuki. The 
   Doctor, needing another guinea pig, drugs Larry and injects him with 
   the serum. Larry, who has been faithful to his wife Linda (Jane 
   Hylton) since his assignment to Tokyo, suddenly begins to change both 
   mentally and physically. He begins to hang out with geisha girls, 
   drinks heavily and blows off the plane ride back to New York to 
   settle down with his wife (thanks to Dr. Suzuki's sexy assistant, 
   Tara [Terri Zimmern], who seduces Larry on Dr. Suzuki's orders). The 
   right side of Larry's body also begins to change. First his hand and 
   arm get hairy and deformed. Then an eye appears on his shoulder. 
   Pretty soon that eye turns into a head and Larry starts roaming the 
   Tokyo streets killing anyone he can get his hands (and heads) on. 
   Larry's boss (Van Hawley) tries to help him by bringing Linda to 
   Tokyo, but<A HREF="manster_1960b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/manster vhs front.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="167" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Larry is too far gone to even care. The police hunt for Larry after 
   finding some damning evidence in his apartment. Larry returns to Dr. 
   Suzuki's laboratory (The Doc says, &quot;He was conceived in the 
   mountains. He'll return to the mountains.&quot;) where he kills Dr. 
   Suzuki and abducts Tara. With the police not far behind, Larry 
   carries Tara to the top of the volcano. Larry then splits in half 
   (the alternate title for this film is <B><A HREF="split_1960.htm">THE SPLIT</A></B>),
    one half being a monster and the other half being the normal Larry. 
   The monster half picks up Tara and tosses her into the volcano. 
   Normal Larry then pushes the monster into the volcano. Larry's wife 
   rushes to him and cradles him in her arms. THE END. Running a scant 
   72 minutes, <B><A HREF="manster_1960b.htm">THE MANSTER</A></B> never 
   has time to be boring. The action picks up immediately and never lets 
   up, thanks to tight direction by George Breakston (<B><A HREF="boy_cried_murder_1966.htm">THE

   effects are surprisingly effective for such an early production. Who 
   can forget the first time we saw the eye growing out of Larry's 
   shoulder? It's one of my earliest horror film memories as an 
   impressionable kid in the 60's. It ranks up there with Ray Tudor as

    the ground breaking gore film of the early sixties. Most of the time 
   the photography is out of focus and it looks like it was edited with 
   a trowel (There is a scene where three hookers are drugged by our 
   psycho that was edited so haphazardly and hilariously, I'm still 
   trying to figure out if it was intentional or not. You'll know the

   asks a succession of hookers, &quot;Are you evil?&quot;, I dare you 
   to keep a straight face. When one of the hookers answers, 
   &quot;Yes&quot;, he takes her to his place and asks, &quot;Would you

   (1973) clone with plenty of full-frontal female nudity and 
   unintentionally hilarious English dubbing, but the violence level is 
   very low, making the film somewhat a chore to get through. The film 
   begins with a streetwalker returning home after a long day, but as 
   soon as she opens the door leading to her apartment complex, she 
   discovers a man cricified, like Jesus on the cross, his bloody body 
   nailed to a wall. A 1972 quote by Pope Paul VI flashes on screen 
   (which I was too lazy to translate) and the opening credits roll. We 
   then see the coroner (Peter B&ouml;hlke) examining the crucified 
   body, telling the Chief Inspector (Karl Walter Diess) that whomever 
   did it was unusually strong. Not only did the killer nail the victim 
   to the wall,<A HREF="magdalena_possessed_by_the_devil_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/magdelana possessed by the devil dvd-r front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="219" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   the victim also had his larynx crushed by human hands. The victim 
   also has a strange mark on his forehead, shaped like a claw or some 
   kind of insignia. It's not scratched on his forehead, but rather like 
   a burn mark. The coroner says that is especially strange since today 
   is also Ash Wednesday. Is there a connection? The Chief Inspector 
   says, &quot;It looks like the carnival ended abruptly for the late 
   Joseph Winter (<I>the victim</I>). All we need now is to find the murderer.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Chief Inspector questions the caretaker of the tenement building 
   Joseph Winter lived and died in and she tells him that Mr. Winter had 
   many strange people visiting him all hours of the night, but she 
   can't recall seeing any of them last night. When she says that she 
   barely got a look at &quot;those women&quot; because they usually 
   came very late at night when the front door was locked, the Chief 
   Inspector asks, &quot;What women?&quot; The caretaker replies that 
   she didn't mean to imply they weren't decent women, as they were 
   elegantly dressed and one of the women had a big dog that looked 
   really ferocious. When the Chief Inspector's unnamed partner 
   (G&uuml;nter Clemens; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#MarkOfTheDevil1970">MARK
    OF THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1970) asks the caretaker if Joseph Winter had 
   any relatives, she says she doesn't know, but she does know he was a 
   widower for ten years and about once a month he would receive visits 
   from a young woman and he would take her out occasionally. The last 
   time the caretaker saw the young woman was on New Year's Day. She 
   would always call him &quot;Grandpa&quot; and he would call her &quot;Magdalena&quot;.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Magdalena (Dagmar Hedrich) and her female friends 
   listening to music in a record store (remember when you could put on 
   headphones and do that?), when a handsome young man named Harry 
   (actor unknown) sneaks up behind Magdalena and steals a kiss (Ah, the 
   rapey '70s!). Magdalena calls him a &quot;bore&quot; and leaves the 
   store with her friends. Harry asks one of those friends if Magdalena 
   is seeing anyone and she says she doesn't know, but if he plays his 
   cards right and is willing to lower his standards, &quot;You might be 
   able to date me!&quot; (Are all German girls this whorish?).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Chief Inspector then questions the streetwalker who found Joseph 
   Winter's body, when his partner enters the room and says that 
   Magdalena's last name is also Winter. She lives in Munich and is 
   registered in a girls boarding school there. He hands his partner the 
   phone number to the boarding school's director, Madame Stolz 
   (Elisabeth Volkmann; <B><A HREF="red_heat_1985.htm">RED HEAT</A></B> 
   - 1985), should he wish to talk to her. The streetwalker tells the 
   two detectives that a man wearing a trenchcoat and a strange look on 
   his face was standing in front of her building just before she 
   discovered the crucified body of Joseph Winter. Is this a clue?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Harry follows Magdalena to a cafe , where he hears her say that she 
   joined the boarding school after her parents died. Harry apologizes 
   for making sexual advances towards her after hearing this bit of news 
   and Magdalena says that's alright, men and boys are always hitting on 
   her, but she's saving herself for when she gets married. Madame Stolz 
   tells the Chief Inspector that Magdalena was only five-years-old when 
   her parents died in a terrible accident and after that her 
   grandfather enrolled her in this school and has been paying her 
   tuition ever since. She also tells the Inspector that her grandfather 
   didn't visit Magdalena much at school; rather she would meet him 
   somewhere and come back with a new dress or a pile of money (I know 
   what you are thinking, pervert!). Magdalena was always excited to 
   visit her grandfather, even the day before he was murdered. Madame 
   Stolz says she doesn't know how to tell Magdalena her grandfather is 
   dead. All the girls are having a party tonight and she's afraid 
   someone will tell her there. (Madame Stolz is more worried about the 
   school's reputation than she is about Magdalena). At the party, which 
   consists of nothing but girls, Magdalena starts getting drunk on 
   champagne, Madame Stolz telling her secretary Hilde (Eva Kinsky) that 
   she's worried that Magdalena will read about her grandfather's murder 
   in the newspapers tomorrow morning. Suddenly, Magdalena has a vision 
   of her grandfather's dead body sitting up on a morgue table and she 
   passes out, convulsing on the floor. We hear flies buzzing overhead 
   and Magdalena starts frothing at the mouth. Madame Stolz's normally 
   docile dog, Alfie, suddenly turns vicious, so Madame Stolz tells all 
   the girls to go to their rooms. Magdalena wakes up and acts like 
   nothing is wrong, but when she goes to bed, she is awoken by the 
   sound of flies buzzing overhead and Alfie tries to attack her. 
   Magdalena goes crazy, shouting, &quot;Go Away!&quot; over and over, 
   destroying the school's kitchen as she is shouting, so Madame Stolz 
   calls Dr. Stone (Michael Hinz; Mario Bava's <B><A HREF="four_times_that_night_1971.htm">FOUR
    TIMES THAT NIGHT</A></B> - 1971) to come and examine her. When he 
   does, he asks Madame Stolz if Magdalena is on drugs. She says no, so 
   Dr. Stone says he will have Professor Falk (Werner Bruhns; <B><A HREF="odessa_file_1974.htm">THE
    ODESSA FILE</A></B> - 1974), a psychiatrist, come and take a look at 
   her. That night, Magdalena rips off all her clothes and writhes 
   around sexually in bed, telling Dr. Stone, &quot;Put it in me!&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next morning, Dr. Stone tells Magdalena that her grandfather is 
   dead and all she has to say is, &quot;I despise the dead!&quot; 
   Magdalena then runs away from boarding school and is picked up 
   hitch-hiking by a horny male driver, who tries to rape her, but 
   Magdalena rips the man apart, breaking his shoulder in several 
   places. Magdalena is then picked up by a policeman on the side of the 
   road and she has no memory of how she got there. She is brought back 
   to the boarding school and this is the time when the shit hits the 
   fan. There's a loud commotion in the school's attic, where objects 
   float in the air and the attic is destroyed, as if a hurricane hit 
   it. The next morning, Madame Stolz brings Dr. Stone and Professor 
   Falk to the attic to show them the damage Magdalena did to it, but 
   it's in pristine condition, everything in its proper place. There's 
   an angry hissing black cat in the attic, but when Magdalena picks it 
   up, the cat is now purring and happy (Madame Stolz then blames the 
   cat for the damage she saw and tries to get the men to believe 
   Magdalena cleaned it all up!). When Dr. Stone, Professor Falk, Madame 
   Stolz and Hilde visit Magdalena in her room a short time later, she's 
   totally naked, tearing a photo of her mother and father in half and 
   saying, &quot;Get out you slut! I don't want to see you again! Get 
   out!&quot; and spits at them. She then says, &quot;I wanna fuck! I 
   said I wanna fuck!&quot; and lies down on the floor and spreads her 
   legs. &quot;You dirty whores! C'mon put it in me!&quot; screams 
   Magdalena. Madame Stolz slaps the shit out of her and holds her down, 
   as Dr. Stone give her a shot of tranquilizer to put her to sleep. I 
   think we can see where this film is headed, but wait, where's the exorcism?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    That's right, it's time to mimic <B>THE EXORCIST</B>, if not 
   verbatim, at least in mind, body and soul, but with a definite German 
   slant, except <A HREF="magdalena_possessed_by_the_devil_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/beyond the darkness poster small2a.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>there
    is no exorcism! Directed by &quot;Michael Walter&quot;, who is 
   actually Walter Boos, more famous for his German sexploitation films, 
   such as the many '70s <B>SCHOOLGIRL REPORT</B> flicks, as well as <B><A HREF="nurses_report_1972.htm">NURSES
    REPORT</A></B> and <B><A HREF="swinging_co-eds_1972.htm">THE 
   SWINGING CO-EDS</A></B> (both 1972). That would help explain this 
   film's copious nudity and lack of extreme violence, but why is there 
   no fucking exorcism??? The screenplay, by August Rieger (<B><A HREF="battle_of_the_godfathers_1973.htm">BATTLE
    OF THE GODFATHERS</A></B> - 1973), contains priceless dialogue, such 
   as when the possessed Magdalena walks into a church, looks at priest 
   Father Conrad (Rudolf Sch&uuml;ndler; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Suspiria1977">SUSPIRIA</A></B> 
   - 1977) and says, &quot;I want to take Communion, not in my mouth, 
   but in my pussy, nun-fucker!&quot; I mean, how can you top that? 
   Believe me, this film tries really hard to do so and reaches 
   delirious heights several times. This film has no problem showing the 
   pretty Dagmar Hedrich totally naked (She only appeared in only two 
   films, this one being her last), giving us several eye-opening 
   full-frontal scenes, but the violence usually accompanying films of 
   this genre is severely lacking here. Not that I'm complaining, mind 
   you, but hardcore possession fans may consider it a cardinal sin. 
   This film touches nearly all the bases for a possession clone, from 
   Magdalena getting a thorough physical in a hospital, puking up a 
   snake (!), swearing like a truck driver and talking in a deep demonic 
   voice (the demon here is called &quot;Balthazar&quot;), but, 
   strangely, it steers clear of showing us an actual exorcism. This 
   film is also a police procedural, a love story and other story 
   elements not usually found in film of this type, so whether you like 
   it or not depends on your tolerance level. If you can get past the 
   non-violence, you may find yourself drawn to this film, like a fly to 
   a possessed girl, ass-licker (One of the possessed Magdalena's 
   nicknames for Professor Falk)! There are better possession clones out 
   there, such as <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BeyondTheDoor1974">BEYOND

   (2008) -</B> This French/Canadian production has been hailed and 
   touted as the new direction of horror, but I think the film is more 
   of a Frankenstein's monster, made up of pieces of different horror 
   film genres (found footage, torture and reality genres) to make some 
   sort of mutant whole. While not necessarily a bad thing, <B><A HREF="martyrs_2008b.htm">MARTYRS</A></B> 
   is not the revolutionary horror film some people claim it to be, but 
   it is a powerful film nonetheless. In 1971, a young girl named Lucie 
   escapes her confinement in an abandoned industrial complex where she 
   was chained and tortured for several months. A medical documentary 
   crew then begin filming Lucie and her background to try and discover 
   why she went through such horrors (and Lucie is of no help since she 
   has been silent since her escape). Lucie is put in an orphanage, 
   where she shies away from all the other children except Anna, who 
   acts as Lucie's surrogate protective sister. The medical crew show 
   Anna all the documentary footage they shot and want her to help them 
   find out who did this (and why<A HREF="martyrs_2008c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/martyrs swedish dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="201" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>)
    to Lucie. Anna and Lucie become inseparable, even though Lucie 
   suffers from terrible nightmares and begins cutting herself. Fifteen 
   years pass and the next time we see Lucie (Mylene Jampanoi), she 
   enters the home of an affluent French family and murders them all 
   with a shotgun (it's shocking in its matter-of-factness), believing 
   that the mother and father were somehow involved in her childhood 
   torture sessions (She kills the brother and sister after asking them, 
   &quot;Do you know what your parents did?&quot;). It's clear that 
   Lucie is damaged goods (She screams at the parents' corpses, &quot;Why
    did you do that to me?&quot; while firing the shotgun into the 
   ceiling), but Anna (Morjana Alaoui) is still around to keep Lucie in 
   check. While Lucie waits at the dead family's house for Anna to pick 
   her up, she is attacked by a naked female demon who slices Lucie's 
   body with a strait-razor. Lucie has been attacked by the apparent 
   inner demon on many occasions since escaping the torture room as a 
   child and with every attack, she regains some memories of what 
   happened in that room fifteen years earlier. The question then 
   becomes: Are these repressed memories actually real (like the female 
   demon, these memories may be nothing more than a child's fantasy) and 
   why is Anna helping her cover-up all her crimes? Both of these 
   questions are answered at the film's midway point, as the film makes 
   a very wide U-turn in the second half when Anna learns firsthand that 
   there is a secret society out there whose sole purpose is to create 
   martyrs. What transpires next is best viewed without the aide of 
   words, since mere sentences and paragraphs cannot convey the sheer 
   systematic torture Anna (who is now the new Lucie) is about to endure 
   to give a bunch of elderly people a glimpse of what lays beyond 
   death. But does God want the living to know the truth?&nbsp; Though 
   not as ground-breaking as a lot of people make it out to be, <B><A HREF="martyrs_2008c.htm">MARTYRS</A></B> 
   still manages to pack an emotional gut-punch or two thanks to its 
   unflinching violence (the shotgun murders and a nasty scene involving 
   a miniature sledgehammer) and a 180 degree turn at the film's halfway 
   mark that will surely catch most viewers off-guard. 
   Director/screenwriter Pascal Laugier (<B><A HREF="saint_ange_2004.htm">SAINT
    ANGE</A></B> [a.k.a. <B><A HREF="house_of_voices_2004.htm">HOUSE OF VOICES</A></B> 
   - 2004]) keeps us on our toes, as the film's second half, involving 
   Lucie's suicide and a discovery Anna makes in the dead family's home, 
   will have some viewers reaching for a bucket to puke in. I don't want 
   to give too much away except to say that Anna finds a new cause to 
   believe in: Her own self-preservation. <B>MARTYRS</B> is a film about 
   secrets and suggests to the audience that maybe some secrets should 
   remain a mystery. As one character says in the film, &quot;It's easy 
   to create a victim. Very easy.&quot; Your enjoyment of this film 
   depends on your tolerance for graphic violence (some of the cutting 
   scenes go way beyond what you may have seen before) and your 
   acceptance that, in some situations, there is no such thing as hope. 
   You have been warned. Also starring Catherine Begin, Robert Toupin,

   they escape? Who in the hell cares! Besides fleeting glimpses of gore 
   (including a ripped-out heart being eaten by ravenous cannibals) and 
   generous doses of full frontal nudity, there&#146;s not much to 
   recommend, as you have probably seen the same thing many times before 
   and done much better. Not worth your time unless you are a cannibal 
   completest. This film also stars Susanne Carvall, Milton Morris and 
   Martha Anderson, who all look rather embarrassed spouting ridiculous 
   lines (When will the Italians learn basic English sentence structure 
   and proper pronunciation?) and shedding their clothes. All this can 
   be blamed on writer/director Michael E. Lemick (actually a pseudonym

   (1982) -</B> Moody, atmospheric horror film with a confusing 
   storyline. It opens with young Susan Walker (Julie Christy Murray) at 
   the funeral of her mother, who died under strange circumstances. When 
   Susan learns that she will now be living with her Aunt Cora Nomed 
   (Laura Hippe; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#SwingingBarmaids">THE 
   SWINGING BARMAIDS</A></B> - 1975) and not at home (Home or with Aunt 
   Cora, her last name will still be &quot;Nomed&quot;. Why it's 
   downright demonic!), she runs through the cemetery, is drawn to the 
   Nomed family mausoleum and she hears voices inside that are calling 
   her name (See, if that were me, I'd be running in the opposite 
   direction, especially since it is sunny out, but it is raining over 
   the mausoleum!). As Susan approaches the mausoleum, the &quot;crown 
   of thorns&quot; seals protecting the gates and the crypt explode; 
   Susan walks inside (Why is it thundering and lightning inside the 
   mausoleum?) and approaches the Nomed crypt, which looks more like a 
   sacrificial altar. When a homeless man tries to stop Susan from going 
   any closer, a robed figure (only seen in shadows) makes the homeless 
   guy's head start to smoke, as he stumbles outside and his eyes 
   explode out of their sockets. Susan's eyes start to glow green as she 
   opens the crypt and we s<A HREF="mausoleum_1982b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mausoleum danish vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="222" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ee
    a demonic clawed hand emerge from it. Over twenty years pass and the 
   adult Susan (Bobbie Bresee; <B><A HREF="evil_spawn_1987.htm">EVIL SPAWN</A></B> 
   - 1987) is married to Oliver Farrell (Marjoe Gortner; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BobbieJoOutlaw">BOBBIE
    JO AND THE OUTLAW</A></B> - 1976), but Aunt Cora tells Susan's 
   psychiatrist, Dr. Simon Andrews (Norman Burton; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DeepSpace">DEEP
    SPACE</A></B> - 1988), that Susan is becoming more and more like her 
   mother and is concerned she will end up dead in the same manner. Dr. 
   Andrews thinks this is all poppycock, but Cora gives him a book on 
   the Nomed family history and hopes it will change his mind before it 
   is too late. It seems Susan was possessed by a demon when she went 
   into that mausoleum as a child (it's part of the &quot;Nomed 
   Curse&quot; that is detailed in the book) and only a &quot;crown of 
   thorns&quot; being placed on the demon's head will vanquish it back 
   to the crypt. Susan is now showing signs of possession, as a drunk 
   (who looks like Dan Haggerty, but isn't), who hit on her in a disco, 
   is burned alive in his car before it explodes. Ben (Maurice 
   Sherbanee), the Farrell's gardener, makes leering advances at Susan, 
   so she lures him into the garage, turns into the green-eyed bitch 
   from hell and hacks him to death with a gardening claw. Aunt Cora is 
   next, as the demonic Susan levitates her and rips open her chest. 
   When Oliver gets a good look at the demonic Susan when he awakens one 
   night, he calls Dr. Andrews, who doesn't believe him, even though he 
   has read the book. Dr. Andrews hypnotizes Susan and her demonic side 
   comes out, so he calls parapsychologist Dr. Roni Logan (Sheri Mann), 
   to help him rid Susan of her demon. Will they be successful or will 
   evil win?&nbsp; Besides lots of mood and atmosphere, <B><A HREF="mausoleum_1982b.htm">MAUSOLEUM</A></B> 
   also offers plenty of nude scenes by Bobbie Bresee (she's a mighty 
   beautiful woman, but not much of an actress) and a few gory deaths, 
   including the iconic scene that is burned into every horror fan's 
   mind: When Susan's breasts turn into two little toothsome demons and 
   kill Oliver in the bathtub. Director Michael Dugan (<B><A HREF="super_seal_1976.htm">SUPER
    SEAL</A></B> - 1976) really doesn't have much to work with in 
   producers Robert Barich and Robert Madero's screenplay, as it is just 
   a fractured mess of demonic possession and supernatural mumbo-jumbo, 
   but the plentiful death scenes (some of which seem to be edited to 
   achieve an R-rating) and Ms. Bresee's nudity will keep viewers 
   occupied. There's unnecessary comic relief from the Farrell's black 
   housekeeper, Elsie (LaWanda Page; <B><A HREF="zapped_1982.htm">ZAPPED</A></B> 
   - 1982), who has the good sense to leave before she becomes the next 
   victim (&quot;Good googily-moogily. Time to stop grieving and start 
   leaving!&quot;) and an unusually long sequence showing Ben the 
   gardener going about his daily routine, but that only adds to the 
   film's strangeness factor. <B><A HREF="mausoleum_1982c.htm">MAUSOLEUM</A></B> 
   is by no means a good horror film, but it is different enough to 
   justify at least one viewing, even though the closing shot is a 
   head-scratcher (I thought Ben was dead, so why is he in the cemetery 
   dressed in a monk's robe and laughing hysterically into the 
   camera?!?). Also featuring Chu Chu Mulave as a delivery man who 
   begins to bleed from his ears and loses an eye when he puts the moves

   (1988) -</B> Italian horror nonsense about Mayan curses with a few 
   good gore scenes tossed in for good measure. After some mumbo-jumbo 
   about an ancient spirit that tried to kill all the Mayan people, but 
   failed, vowing to return in the future to yank-out the hearts of his 
   victims with his own hands, we witness Dr. Salomon Slivak (William 
   Berger; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#HellHunters">HELL HUNTERS</A></B> 
   - 1986) having some strange vision of his death after staring into a 
   small antique mirror. He drives into the Mexican mountains, where he 
   encounters a cryptic little girl with frizzy hair and follows her to 
   an ancient Mayan pyramid. He ends up dying just like in his vision, 
   when someone or something plunges a dagger in his chest and drags him 
   away. We then cut to Peter (Peter Phelps), an American living in 
   Mexico, who spends his days gambling on finger wrestling contests 
   (where we watch one man bloodily ripping-off the finger of his 
   opponent!), screwing the local senoritas or scamming the local 
   fishermen out of product for the restaurant/bar he co-owns. When Dr. 
   Slivak's daughter, Lisa (Mariella Valentini)<A HREF="maya_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/maya dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="182" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>,
    arrives in town to claim her father's body, she is appalled to 
   discover that his chest was sliced open and his heart removed. 
   Finding out that Peter and her father were friends, Lisa hires Peter 
   to find out who murdered her father. Meanwhile, a series of grisly 
   murders begin to take place in town, always prefaced by the victims 
   looking into mirrors before they meet their deaths, beginning with 
   two very annoying Texas teens who have come south of the border to 
   get drunk on cheap booze and rape the local women (One teen ends up 
   with his head crushed under the hood of their truck, while the gets a 
   metal pole thrust into his mouth until it exits out the back of his 
   head). Lisa finds a manuscript written by her father that tells of 
   the ancient spirit returning to life and Peter takes her to a local 
   witchdoctor, where they witness an exorcism and the possessed victim 
   throws-up a pile of snakes. As more people end up dead (with their 
   hearts missing), Peter admits to Lisa that he and her father went to 
   a shaman to &quot;expand their minds&quot; and, in doing so, may have 
   awakened the ancient spirit. Peter must now find a way to put the 
   genie (in the form of the frizzy-haired little girl) back into the 
   bottle before it claims his and Lisa's lives. And wouldn't you know 
   it, today is the Day of the Dead? For God's sake, whatever you do, 
   don't look in the mirror!&nbsp; While this film, directed and 
   co-written by Marcello Avallone (<B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Specters1987">SPECTERS</A></B> 
   - 1987), is confusing as hell and relies a little too heavily on 
   mysticism, it's not without it's good points, which includes a 
   constant sense of dread, plenty of well-done graphic deaths and lots 
   and lots of female nudity and sex. I particularly liked Avallone's 
   use of mirrors in this film. While not used as overtly as in <B><A HREF="poltergeist_3_1988.htm">POLTERGEIST
    III</A></B> (made the same year as this) or the more recent <B><A HREF="mirrors_2008.htm">MIRRORS</A></B> 
   (2008), the placement of mirrors in <B>MAYA</B> is downright 
   ingenious in spots. While we take looking in the mirror as an 
   everyday experience and give it no thought whatsoever, in this film 
   it's a certain death sentence. Some of the deaths are very hard to 
   watch, such as Peter's on-again, off-again girlfriend Jahaira 
   (Mariangelica Ayala), who looks in a mirror while taking a bath and 
   gets her face repeatedly bashed onto the faucet and side of the tub 
   until her nose splits in two. Or Maria (Antonella Angelluci), Dr. 
   Slivak's lover/assistant, who ends up hung by the neck after some 
   deep sea fishing hooks rip through her flesh. The plot may be as thin 
   as a seedy motel's walls (script by Avallone, Andrea Purgatori and 
   producer Maurizio Tedesco), but <B><A HREF="maya_1988c.htm">MAYA</A></B> 
   more than makes up for it with inventive deaths, lots of beautiful 
   female flesh, a pulsing electronic score, creepy atmosphere and some 
   nice outdoor cinematography (filmed on the Isle of Margarita in 
   Venezuela). The finale, which takes place at an airport, is a real 
   brain-scratcher, though. Also starring Cyrus Elias, Mirella D'Angelo, 
   Antonello Fassardi, Erich Wilpret, Tullio Cavalli and Vilma Ramia.

    effective, atmospheric and moody horror film. When Arletty (Marianna 
   Hill) stops receiving letters from her artist father (Royal Dano), 
   she travels to the small coastal town of Point Dune to check up on 
   him. She enters his house and finds the walls painted with eerie 
   silouettes of people with blank staring faces. She also finds her 
   father's diary which details his descent into madness, caused by some 
   unknown disease which is rapidly spreading throughout the town. While <A HREF="return_of_the_living_dead_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/messiah of evil 2.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="155" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>searching
    the town for her father, Arletty meets a man (Michael Greer) who is 
   in town with his two girlfriends (!) (Anitra Ford and Joy Bang) 
   researching the legend of the &quot;Blood Moon&quot;, the night when 
   the moon turns red and the population goes cannibalistic. The warning 
   signs are already there: People start bleeding from the eyes and puke 
   out beetles, maggots and lizards from their mouths. They also begin 
   to chow down on the unaffected population. Disheveled bum Elisha Cook 
   Jr. warns Arletty that her father is dead, and if she were to meet 
   him, she should set him on fire because that is the only way to rid 
   the world of the menace. Bullets and dismemberment have no effect 
   (and not for the lack of trying). When Arletty finally meets her 
   father, he lays this horrifying tale of the town to her: One hundred 
   years ago a man dressed in black rode into town. He was a preacher 
   and one of the surviving members of the ill-fated Donner Party who 
   grew to like the taste of human flesh. The townspeople didn't care 
   much for him so he walked into the ocean vowing to return in a 
   hundred years to spread his flesh fetish. The time has come for his 
   return. The film is intentionally slow-moving and uses that pacing to 
   drop small clues and set up some genuinely shocking visuals. The 
   scene with Joy Bang in a supposedly empty movie house (showing 
   Bernard Girard's seldom-seen western <B><A HREF="gone_with_the_west_1975.htm">GONE
    WITH THE WEST</A></B> [1975]) is a knockout as is the finale where 
   the populace attack Hill and Greer at her father's house. And there's 
   also the strange looking, albino-like man who likes to eat mice!

   by the son (horrendously acted by Jason Arnold) of his love interest 
   (Catherine Baranov). Eastman shows a fondness for draping his 
   cinematic compositions with neon lighting. Unfortunately, much of the 
   action takes place in the darkness, making it very difficult to see 
   anything. The performances are bad all around, as the actors seem to 
   be reading off cue cards. The gore and nudity are kept to a bare 
   minimum which makes this film barely watchable. Exploitation veteran

    KISS</A><A NAME="Midnight Kiss"></A> (1992) -</B> One thing that I 
   really hate is a movie that starts off promising and then immediately 
   sinks into total mediocrity. This is one of those films. In the 
   parking lot of a bar, a woman is being raped by a drunken lout who 
   she rebuffed earlier. Along comes a priest (Gregory A. Greer) and he 
   steps in to stop the attack. The drunk shoves a knife into the 
   priest's hand and then we learn that the <A HREF="midnight_kiss_1992.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/midnight kiss vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="117" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>priest
    is actually a vampire. He rips off the drunk's face and throws him 
   into a wall while the bar owner comes out and unloads a shotgun blast 
   into the priest's chest (with no effect). He takes the gun away and 
   shoots the bar owner in the chest and then blows his head off with 
   another pull of the trigger. He then proceeds to make a meal out of 
   the woman. That's the good part. It goes downhill from there. When 
   the police arrive, we learn that the woman is number 17 in a string 
   of killings of women by the unknown serial killer. Enter ex-homicide 
   officer Carrie Blass (Michelle Owens), who now works on rape cases 
   after botching a homicide investigation run by her ex-husband Dennis 
   (Michael McMillen). She desperately wants back on homicide, even 
   going as far as trying to sleep with her Captain (Robert Miano) to 
   get back in. She refuses at the last minute, but the Captain puts her 
   back in anyway and has her team up with her ex-husband as a 
   partner.&nbsp; During a failed stakeout, Carrie gets bitten on the 
   arm by the vampire before putting a bullet into his head and getting 
   away. She begins a slow transformation into a vampire as Dennis and 
   the entire police department don't believe her story. Carrie must 
   destroy all of the vampire's undead victims and track down and 
   destroy him so she can get back to her normal human self. She drags 
   Dennis along and finally she gets him to believe her after killing 
   one female victim who comes back to life in the morgue. Now Carrie 
   and Dennis must track down the head vampire before the night is out. 
   There are a few parts of this film that are, to put it mildly, 
   flabbergasting. How is it that a vampire can wear a crucifix as an 
   earring and is not afraid of crosses? (The only explanation we are 
   given is when the vampire says to Carrie, &quot;Don't believe 
   everything you read.&quot; Huh?!?) And where did this vampire come 
   from? No explanation is ever given. Another scene shows Carrie (in 
   the midst of becoming a vampire and dressed provocatively) disarming 
   a perp in the police station and bashing his head against the wall 
   until brain matter appears. What happens to Carrie? She gets pats on 
   the back from her fellow officers and the incident is never mentioned 
   again. Director Joel Bender (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Immortalizer">THE

   of the film drags so badly that, any interest you may have had,

   director Ted Radford (Arthur Roberts; <B><A HREF="hammerhead_shark_frenzy_2005.htm">HAMMERHEAD:
    SHARK FRENZY</A></B> - 2005) has been institutionalized for forty 
   years, ever since starring in and directing his last film, &quot;The 
   Dark Beneath&quot;, a creepy black &amp; white horror film that has 
   strange effects on whomever watches it. Some stupid psychiatrist 
   decides to &quot;cure&quot; Radford by projecting the film on a 
   continuous loop in his cell; thinking that if Radford faces his worst 
   fears, his psychosis will be cured. Dr. Wayne (Michael Swan) doesn't 
   think it's such a good idea and he's right. When Dr. Wayne returns to 
   the asylum the following day, the place is a bloody mess; everyone is 
   missing and Radford (after taking a bite out of his own wrist) has 
   left a strange circular symbol on the floor in his room, written in 
   his own blood. Five years later, a small movie theater managed by 
   Bridget (Rebekah Brandes; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CursePirateDeath">CURSE
    OF PIRATE DEATH</A></B> - 2006) is showing Radford's film for the 
   first time to audiences in forty years as a Midnight Movie and, as 
   you can probably guess, this is not going to be a<A HREF="midnight_movie_2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/midnight movie dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   quiet night. Detective Barrons (Jon Briddell) is convinced that 
   Radford is still alive and will show up at the theater (Seventy 
   people disappeared from the asylum five years earlier, including 
   Radford, and their bodies were never found), so he sits in the back 
   row as the film unspools, hoping to catch Radford in the act (of what 
   is not yet made clear). Luckily, the theater is nearly empty (kids 
   today have no soul!); just Bridget's boyfriend Josh (Daniel Bonjour), 
   his friend Mario (Greg Cirulnick), girlfriend Samantha (Mandell 
   Maughan), film nerd Sully (Michael Schwartz), burley biker Harley 
   (Stan Ellsworth), his old lady (Melissa Steach) and the small theater 
   staff. As everyone watches the film on-screen (it's a riff on <B><A HREF="texas_chainsaw_massacre_1974.htm">THE
    TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE</A></B>), fantasy and horror become blurred 
   with reality, as the skull-faced killer in the film begins killing 
   people in the theater, the real-life murders somehow showing up 
   on-screen (only in black &amp; white). Dr. Wayne shows up at the 
   theater to keep Detective Barrons company, both still not aware of 
   what is really going on in the theater (Even Bridget and the gang 
   think they are being punked when the killer murders Sully on-screen). 
   When everyone finally realizes what a dire situation they are all 
   really in, it's too late, as they find themselves trapped in the 
   theater with no way out (the doors are supernaturally closed and 
   there is no cellphone service), while the film plays on the screen. 
   Whenever a murder happens in the film, the killer strikes in real 
   life, using a fancy sharp spiral homemade tool to slice throats, 
   remove hearts and thrust through torsos. How can anyone stop a killer 
   on film? How about stopping the film in the projection booth? With 
   all the doors shut tighter than a new prisoner's ass at his first 
   communal shower, only Bridget's younger brother Timmy (Justin Baric), 
   who snuck into the theater earlier, can fit though the air ducts that 
   lead to the projection booth. As they will find out, the murders only 
   really stop once everyone stops being scared. Easier said than 
   done.&nbsp; Although this film has some effective moments (especially 
   the segues between black &amp; white and color), it's full of stock, 
   stereotypical characters and clich&eacute;d situations. What it all 
   boils down to is a masked killer stalking a theater and killing its 
   patrons, with some supernatural mumbo-jumbo (which is never 
   adequately explained) thrown-in for good measure. First-time director 
   Jack Messitt, who co-wrote the screenplay with Mark Garbett, tries to 
   make things relevant by portraying Bridget and young brother Timmy as 
   victims of an abusive, violent father (who we never see), but when 
   they are the last two survivors and resort to quoting the &quot;Lord's
    Prayer&quot; to put them in their &quot;safe place&quot;, just like 
   they use to do when daddy beat them, the film goes off the rails and 
   never recovers. There are some bloody kills (especially Detective 
   Barrons' and Dr. Wayne's deaths), but <B>MIDNIGHT MOVIE</B> is 
   nothing but generic &quot;stalk 'n' slash&quot; stuff. This territory 
   was covered much more effectively in director Bigas Luna's <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Anguish">ANGUISH</A></B>

   cheapness of the production (videography, sound, set direction, music 
   and editing are all generally poor). This is the story of angry nerd 
   Warren (Joe McDonald), who can't find a girlfriend no matter how hard 
   he tries (That's his problem, he tries way too hard). He and equally 
   nerdy co-worker Larry (Christopher Wade) go to local pick-up joint

    him that she has a policy against dating co-workers (Warren, whose 
   deceased father was a popular professional wrestler, is slowly losing 
   his grip, as he punches mirrors and puts a steak knife to his throat 
   when he doesn't get his way), so he buries himself in his work and 
   finds an old manuscript on mind control deep in the library's 
   archives. The manuscript describes in detail on how to unlock the 90% 
   of the brain we don't use and Warren begins to follow the 
   instructions. Larry (who is a human encyclopedia of knowledge) tells 
   Warren that the person who wrote the manuscript, Dr. Vivac Chandra 
   (Tom Henry), died &quot;a horrible death&quot; in 1957, but Warren 
   pays it no mind because he feels like a &quot;changed man&quot; after 
   reading it. Too bad that the changes also apply to physical 
   manifestations, as well as mental. Warren not only becomes a genius 
   and can read other people's minds, he can also manipulate people's 
   minds (he &quot;helps&quot; Larry solve the Rubik's Cube) and control 
   machines (like TVs and snack machines). He and Larry go back to 
   Swingles, where Warren uses his new-found powers and scores with the 
   first chick he hits on, but he begins to suffer from extreme 
   headaches whenever he overuses his powers and loses even more of his 
   already-fragile temper. When he finally tries his powers on Sandy, 
   he's only partially successful and Sandy becomes scared of him. 
   Warren becomes more unglued (When Mr. Townsend berates Larry in front 
   of everyone over nothing, Warren wills Townsend's clothes away, so he 
   is standing in nothing but his underwear!) and &quot;forces&quot; 
   Sandy to have dinner at his place, where she shows more interest in 
   Brad than him. She and Brad become &quot;friendly&quot; and Warren 
   finally loses it. His hair begins to fall out, his forehead becomes 
   larger and larger and he nearly cuts-off Larry's fingers with a paper 
   cutter when he can't find the last two pages of the manuscript (He 
   reads Larry's mind and discovers that Larry is hiding the last two 
   pages from him. Larry knows the last two pages will put Warren over 
   the edge and he is just trying to be a good friend). Before long, 
   Warren's brain becomes too big for his body, as he becomes a 
   grotesque monster who can't control his own thoughts. Larry, Brad and 
   Sandy band together to try and save Warren, who is searching for a 
   device created by Dr. Chandra that will separate his mind from his 
   body and make him a &quot;god&quot;. Larry pays a visit to Dr. 
   Chandra's senile mother (Diana Calhoun), seeking clues to the 
   whereabouts of the device (Larry has also read the manuscript, 
   including the final two pages, but he is much more in control of his 
   mentality because he has no problem being seen as a &quot;geek&quot;. 
   As a matter of fact, he embraces it.), but Warren has already found 
   it and used it on himself. What happens next is a tour-de-force of 
   bladder effects, a gooey, toothy brain creature and head-scratching 
   theatrics.&nbsp; While the themes of <B><A HREF="mind_killer_1987c.htm">MIND

   little-seen werewolf flick, <B><A HREF="lone_wolf_1988.htm">LONE WOLF</A></B>,
    in 1988, the other two films in the Flash Features canon) doesn't 
   have the talent or the budget to pull-off such a heady (pun intended) 
   topic. The screenplay, written by Dave Sipos, Curtis Hannum and 
   Krueger, has a lot of good ideas about what could happen if someone 
   were able to use 100% of their brain, but the actors are incapable of 
   rising to the material. At least the creature effects are halfway 
   decent, but we have to wade through nearly 70 minutes of bad acting 
   to get to them and when we finally do, they are nearly ruined by some 
   really cheap optical effects, such as Larry suddenly having the power 
   to shoot electric bolts from his fingertips. The film is a total mess 
   from a technical standpoint, too, and it is filled with 80's fashions 
   and hairstyles we would all rather forget. Still, <B><A HREF="mind_killer_1987b.htm">MIND

   Suttersville. They are warned by the local sheriff (Law, who is also

   (Ford) to stay away from the mines as not to disturb the legendary Forty-Niner
    (Brad H. Ardin), a ghostly miner who will kill anyone who steals his 
   hidden gold. It's already too late, as the Forty-Niner has already 
   come to life thanks to Claire's brother (who we see is hanged by a 
   hook in the beginning of the film). Claire and her friends find the

   off a chain of events which leads to the grisly deaths of several of 
   the friends and locals (Death by pick, death by shovel, death by

   remaining people and relates the story of how the Forty-Niner came to 
   be. He was originally called Jeremiah Stone (played by Wells in the

   jumped mining claims, killing (and eating) many people to get his 
   gold. It is claimed that he was so mean that even the Devil would not 
   take him when he was killed, lying in wait until his gold is 
   disturbed. The only way to destroy him is to return every piece of 
   gold to it's original resting place and burn him when he comes to 
   check up on it. The remaining three survivors come up with a way to 
   destroy the Forty-Niner and think they have succeeded, only to have a

   after she gets into a huge argument with her father. It's not long

    stays in a sleazy motel and gets mistaken as a hooker by two drunken 
   guys who chase her into a bar (where the gentlemen refuse to enter 
   because there is a cover charge!). In the bar, Susan meets a Vietnam 
   veteran (P.K. Flamingo), a ne'er-do-well who convinces Susan that he 
   is a hitman (it's obvious by his clumsiness that he's not). Susan, 
   using her body as collateral, talks him into breaking into Molly's 
   house and killing her. Armed with a butcher knife in one hand and a 
   machete in the other, he chickens out when Molly wakes up and starts 
   screaming. Somehow, Susan convinces Molly to take her back (and we 
   also learn that Susan was adopted by Molly's family when Susan's 
   mother mysteriously disappeared and her father's identity was never 
   established), but Susan becomes so obsessed with Jeff, she hires a 
   professional hitman (who she finds from an ad in a Soldier Of 
   Fortune-like magazine) to kill Molly. Susan seriously fucks-up when 
   she sends the hitman, John (Daniel Martine), a photo of herself 
   instead of Molly and John ends up strangling Susan instead. In what 
   amounts to a total left-hand turn in the film, Susan's ghost is 
   picked-up in a white stretch limousine by one of God's agents (!) and 
   she convinces the agent to let her return to Earth to atone for her 
   sins. Instead of atoning, Susan begins haunting Molly and Jeff and 
   seeks revenge on John for killing her (Wouldn't God immediately 
   revoke her status and just send her to Hell? Oh, well...). She haunts 
   and taunts John repeatedly (by wearing different theatrical fright 
   masks and saying such things to him as, &quot;Run! Run to your grave! 
   It waits for you!&quot;), so much so that he impales himself on a 
   tree branch and dies while trying to escape her ghostly image in a 
   forest. Susan then turns her attention to Molly and Jeff. She 
   possesses Molly's body and begins sleeping around, much to Jeff's 
   chagrin. Can Molly find a way to get her body back and send Susan 
   back to her grave?&nbsp; The paper-thin plot (no one gets screen 
   credit for writing the screenplay), along with a lack of any 
   substantial violence (John's impalement is the only blood on view) or 
   nudity (there's only Susan's early topless scene and a quick shot of 
   Jeff's naked ass), should be enough to turn-off any serious genre 
   viewers, but director/co-producer Don Jones tosses-in several 
   &quot;What The Fuck?!?&quot; moments to keep us entertained 
   throughout. Jones certainly makes some odd choices, my favorite being 
   John shooting at Susan's ghost in the forest and showing us a couple 
   of super-slow-motion shots of John firing his gun and the bullets 
   leaving the barrel, passing through Susan's (superimposed) body and 
   exploding into the trunks of trees or some conveniently-placed tin 
   cans on the ground. There's another unbelievable scene where Jeff 
   gets the idea to hire a parapsychologist after looking at the VHS box 
   of <B><A HREF="ghostbusters_1984.htm">GHOSTBUSTERS</A></B> (1984)! I 
   also love the way Molly and Jeff so easily accept the fact that they 
   are being haunted by Susan's ghost and don't seem concerned at all 
   when glass vases and furniture start flying around the house. The 
   not-so-special effects consist of double exposures for the ghost 
   effects, cheap opticals and even emulsion scratching. As a matter of 
   fact, this film has production values that are a step-down from TV 
   soap operas, but that only adds to the film's charms. The truth is 
   that <B><A HREF="molly_and_the_ghost_1991b.htm">MOLLY AND THE GHOST</A></B> 
   doesn't make a lick of sense (especially what's written on Susan's 
   headstone in the finale, but I'll leave that tidbit for you to 
   discover yourselves), but we are all better off for it nonetheless. 
   It's so illogical, it's brain-frying. Jones edited the film using the 
   name &quot;Nod Senoj&quot; (I'll give you a minute to process it).

   A group of diverse and strange people are staying at a gothic-looking 
   and rundown boarding house managed by the obnoxious Woody (Mitch 
   Pileggi). The newest boarder, Ken (Andy Tiemann), becomes acquainted 
   with all the guests and their predilictions. Besides Woody (who is a 
   real pain in the ass), there's meek writer Jerry (Terry Evans), who 
   is scared of his own shadow; stringbean military buff Ike (Jonathan 
   M. Ingraffia), who blasts cadence marches on his hi-fi; Woody's 
   girlfriend Turquoise (Rachel Winfew), who tends her garden and 
   meditates; ex-bar owner Leon (Daniel Medina), who has a kick-ass 
   custom made <B><A HREF="deep_throat_1972.htm">DEEP THROAT</A></B>

    the group. When Ike's dog (who never stops barking) breaks his chain 
   and attacks Toad, Woody shoots and kills it. Jerry watches the attack 
   from his window and starts having some type of psychotic reaction 
   (Sharon tells Ken that Jerry was attacked by a dog as a kid and now 
   has a severe fear of canines). To spite Ike, Woody brings home a 
   puppy and keeps it in the basement (he plans on turning it into a 
   guard dog). Ike has bigger problems, though. He's severely jealous of 
   Ken spending time with Sharon (she dated Ike a couple of times), so 
   he and Woody play a nasty practical joke on Ken (it involves putting 
   the body of Ike's dead dog in Ken's bed). The prank goes horribly 
   wrong and Ken is electrocuted. Woody and Ike get rid of all the 
   incriminating evidence before calling the police. Jerry sees the dead 
   dog and Ken's body and tells Sharon, &quot;I can't let them get away 
   with this!&quot; Sharon can't take it and leaves the boarding house 
   for good. Then the shit hits the fan. Woody's puppy is found torn 
   apart in the basement. Woody blames Ike, but Jerry tells everyone 
   that he heard a growling dog in the hallway. The next night, Ike is 
   mauled and killed by some unseen growling beast outside the house. 
   Turquoise finds Ike's body in her garden and the police are called. 
   No one, including the police, believe Jerry's claims of a growling 
   creature roaming the halls. Jerry continues having bad nightmares and 
   Woody disappears. When Turquoise finds Woody's body, the killer is 
   revealed. It attacks Turquoise and Leon, killing them. Toad comes 
   home from work and is impaled on a spike sticking out of the wall in 
   the cellar. Sharon stops by for a visit and is saved by the 
   landlord's well-aimed shotgun blast.&nbsp; This is the only feature

   extremely low-budget but has a certain charm that can't be denied. 
   Pretty well acted for a zero budget item, third-billed Mitch Pileggi

   bullying people to get his way and being somewhat humorous at the

   landlord (probably for some quick booze money), but all he does is 
   yell, scream and yell some more before he saves the day. His total

   Raven (Alice Cooper) is returning to his boyhood mansion to film a 
   music video for his new song &quot;Identity Chrises&quot; (sp). On 
   the way towards town, Vince and his crew are stopped at a roadblock 
   manned by Sheriff Morrison (Ricardo Palacios), who warns Vince and 
   his crew that a pack of wild dogs are running loose and have killed 
   five people so far. The sheriff also mentions Vince's dead father and 
   something (bad) that happened twenty years ago, but Vince doesn't 
   want to talk about it. As soon as Vince leaves the roadblock, the 
   sheriff and his deputy are attacked and killed by a weird-looking 
   dog. Vince hits a dog with his van and puts it out it's misery with a 
   rock to it's head. An old man (B. Barta Barri) with bloody clothes 
   appears out of nowhere<A HREF="monster_dog_1984.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/monster dog vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>

   they get to the mansion, they find it deserted, but well-stocked with 
   food, booze and a &quot;Welcome Home Vincent&quot; banner across the 
   front doorway. Vince grabs a shotgun and searches the house while 
   Angela (Pepita James) has a nightmare that everyone is dead and 
   Vincent has become a werewolf. Vince's manager and girlfriend, Sandra 
   (Victoria Vera), becomes worried when Vince tells her that he 
   believes werewolves are real and that his father was one. Twenty 
   years ago, the townspeople stabbed his father with pitchforks and 
   burned him alive with gasoline after they caught him eating livestock 
   and people. Is it possible that the curse was passed from father to 
   son? While filming a video for Vince's new tune (&quot;See Me In The 
   Mirror&quot;), the dead body of the mansion's caretaker comes 
   crashing through a window and lands on Angela. As Angela runs out of 
   the house (with Vince in close pursuit), four psychotic hunters 
   invade the mansion and hold everyone prisoner, waiting for Vince to 
   return so they can kill him (they blame his return for the rash of 
   killings). The hunters kill Angela by mistake as she walks through 
   the door and Vince is forced to kill three of the hunters with his 
   shotgun. A pack of dogs invades the mansion, attack the crew and kill 
   the fourth hunter. The werewolf then makes an appearance and begins 
   devouring the rest of the crew. When all that are left are Sandra and 
   Marilou (Maria Jose Sarsa), the question remains: Is Vince the 
   &quot;Monster Dog&quot; or is it someone else?&nbsp; This 
   Spanish/Italian co-production, directed/scripted by Claudio Fragasso (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Troll 2">TROLL
    2</A></B> - 1990) using his &quot;Clyde Anderson&quot; pseudonym, is 
   definitely a product under the influence of the MTV Generation, back 
   when MTV was vital and actually showed music videos. Mixing music 
   video techniques with Gothic atmosphere is a strange brew and 
   sometimes it works. The main problem with this film is that Alice 
   Cooper voice is dubbed (his music videos here are not, though) by 
   someone whose voice is two octaves too low and it severely hampers 
   any scene Cooper is in (which is about 70% of the film). The film 
   doesn't make very much sense, but it does contain a lot of gory 
   bloodshed, including a nasty shot of Vince blowing the top off one 
   hunter's head with a shotgun blast, some bloody dog attacks and lots 
   of mangled bodies. At 84 minutes, the film doesn't overstay it's 
   welcome and some scenes are quite good (some tracking shots inside 
   the house are very foreboding), but the Monster Dog looks like a bad 
   puppet. Besides two original Alice Cooper songs, I'm pretty sure 
   there's also an uncredited song or two by the Alan Parsons Project 
   (&quot;A Dream Within A Dream&quot; and &quot;The Raven&quot;). <B><A HREF="monster_dog_1985c.htm">MONSTER

   bedridden girl. After offing the babysitter with a pickaxe through

   younger brother. Will she be able to get out of the bed and stave off

   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film opens with dancer Julia (Barbara Hawards, in her only film) 
   running through a dark empty theater, being chased by a vampire 
   (Giuseppe Addobbati, as &quot;John Marc Douglas&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WatchMeKill1977">WATCH
    ME WHEN I KILL</A></B> - 1977) , who is laughing maniacally. The 
   theater's caretaker, Achille (Alberto Archetti, as &quot;Albert 
   Archet&quot;; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#MillStoneWomen1960">MILL
    OF THE STONE WOMEN</A></B> - 1960) tries to help Julia, but there 
   seem to be some invisible shield around her that stops hin from 
   touching her. He gives up quickly when the vampire gives him a nasty 
   scowl. The vampire tries to impale Julia's chest with a pitchfork 
   (spending a little too much time using it to play with her breasts!), 
   but she escapes and runs outside (in funny sped-up footage, which I 
   believe was not meant to be funny). She rests at a rock near the 
   shore of a brook, thinking she is safe, but, of course, she isn't, as 
   the vampire grabs her from behind, throws her in the water and bites 
   her on the neck. It all turns out to be a nightmare, as Julia screams 
   and wakes up in a chair at a rehearsal hall where her fellow female 
   dancers slack off and playfully dance with the male dancers in the 
   company (Telling them that they don't believe in love, as just 
   because they kiss them, it doesn't mean that they love them. To these 
   female dancers, love is dead.). Julia thinks that everyone should be 
   rehearsing the latest show they are going to put on and wonders 
   what's keeping Sandro (Marco Mariani, as &quot;Marc Maryan&quot;; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DeathSmilesMurder73">DEATH
    SMILES ON A MURDERER</A></B> - 1973), the company's director and 
   Julia's lover, who was supposed to be at rehearsal. Turns out Sandro 
   is looking for a place to perform their latest show and he picks the 
   Aquarius Theatre, but caretaker Achille (yes, the same person from 
   Julia's nightmare!) tells Sandro he doesn't want to use this theater, 
   as it is haunted by a vampire, saying he just tried to stop the 
   vampire from chasing a woman, proving Julia wasn't having a nightmare 
   at all! But how can that be? Achille tells Sandro that many young 
   actresses &quot;disappeared in the walls&quot; of this theater, 
   showing him newspaper articles backing up his claim. Sandro just 
   laughs, saying they were nothing but publicity stunts to put asses in 
   the seats and is adamant about using the Aquarius Theatre for his new 
   show, not knowing that he is opening a deadly can of worms, the kind 
   of worms that inhabit the corpses of the victims of <A HREF="monster_of_the_opera_1964.htm#VampireOpera">&quot;The
    Vampire Of The Opera&quot;</A> (an alternate title for the film).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Achille tells Sandro that a hundred years ago professional mediums 
   were called to the theater to perform a seance to rid the theater of 
   evil, but the evil in the theater was so powerful, the mediums became 
   frightened and left quickly with their tails between their legs. As 
   Achille is talking to Sandro, people in skeleton costumes begin 
   dancing in all corners of the theater. Turns out it's the dance 
   company playing a practical joke on Sandro, but it's Achille who gets 
   angry, as Sandro finds it funny. Achille begins talking to the 
   &quot;Old Ghost' in the theater, telling it to go away. Sandro talks 
   to the Old Ghost, too, introducing it to all the members of the dance 
   company, telling it their names. He shouldn't have done that! Sandro 
   notices that Julia is missing and asks where she is. Yvette (Jody 
   &quot;Johnny&quot; Excell) tells him that Julia disappeared when they 
   entered the theater (Yvette says she can take Julia's place in the 
   show because she's a better dancer and also better looking. 
   Ahhh...dancers!). Suddenly, the lights go out in the theater and all 
   the women scream. When the lights come back on, Giorgio (George 
   Arms), the company's lighting technician, admits to pulling the prank 
   (Why in the world would he do that?). Sandro asks Giorgio if he has 
   seen Julia and he says no. Right after he says that, a black cat 
   appears on the edge of one of the theater's balconies, where it 
   hisses and meows loudly and disappears. When Sandro orders Achille to 
   find Julia, she appears on the edge of the same balcony as the cat, 
   removes her jacket, revealing she is wearing a toga and says to 
   everyone, &quot;I'm looking down on you, little Earthlings, like an 
   Olympian Goddess!&quot; Sandro tells her to be careful or she may 
   fall (Yvette says, &quot;Then we'll be looking down on you!&quot; 
   Ahhh...dancers!), so Julia hops off the balcony railing and as she 
   walks the dark corridors, shr becomes scared, meeting Achille in one 
   of those corridors. They both instantly recognize each other, even 
   though they have never met, Julia becoming even more scared, as 
   Achille asks, &quot;Who are you?&quot; Julia runs away screaming and 
   the entire company, hearing Julia's screams, go looking for her.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Julia tells Sandro, &quot;That old man scared me!&quot;, so Sandro, 
   Giorgio and Tony (Renato Montalbano; <B><A HREF="star_pilot_1966.htm">STAR
    PILOT</A></B> - 1966) go looking for Achille, who is in the 
   theater's basement, which is full of props. They find Achille 
   unconscious, the result of some heavy props falling and hitting him 
   on the head. The trio also finds a coffin, which they think is also a 
   prop, but it is really a gateway to another dimension, where the 
   vampire spends mosts of his time during daylight!. When they open the 
   coffin, all the find is a complete suit of black tie and tails, as if 
   someone was wearing it and disappeared. When Achille wakes up, Julia 
   tells him that she has met him before, but he denies it, not wanting 
   to admit that he met her before in a dream in front of Sandro. Julia 
   tells Sandro that she doesn't like this theater; she feels that 
   someone or something is watching her. Sandro says she's imagining 
   things, so the company rehearses their show, an indescribable mess of 
   1920's Charleston dancing, mixed with the kind of bump and grinding 
   you would see at a strip club! For some reason, Julia leaves 
   mid-rehearsal in a huff and Sandro follows her, asking what is wrong (<B>Sandro:</B> 
   &quot;I want to understand you.&quot;&nbsp; <B>Julia:</B> &quot;You 
   can't!&quot;). Sandro professes his love for Julia and they kiss, but 
   Julia stops abruptly when she sees a portrait hanging on a wall. It's 
   the spitting image of the vampire that chased her in her nightmare. 
   We then discover that Achille is the vampire's unwilling assistant. 
   We also discover that dancers Yvette , Aurora (Carla Cavalli) and 
   Rossana (Vittoria Prada; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#DeathFourposter1964">DEATH
    ON THE FOURPOSTER</A></B> - 1964) love each other, not as friends, 
   but love that is sapphic, the love people didn't talk about in the early-'60s!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While the company is rehearsing, the vampire makes himself known 
   (wearing the same black tie and tails that were in the coffin), 
   introducing himself as Stefano and saying he never misses a 
   performance in this theater. He pays special interest in Julie, but 
   when Rossana is fixing her makup using a hand mirror, she can see 
   that Stefano has no reflection and screams, dropping the mirror on 
   the floor and breaking it (One of the dancers tells Rossana that 
   she's going to have seven years of bad luck. Ahhh...dancers!). 
   Stefano walks over to Rosanna and says he hopes she isn't 
   superstitious, just when a heavy bag of sand falls and lands where 
   Stefano was previously standing. It was Achille who cut the rope 
   holding the bag, hoping it would drop on Stefano and kill him 
   (Obviously, Achille knows nothing about vampires!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Everyone wants to leave the theater, but Sandro refuses, telling 
   everyone to stop acting childish. Besides, they can't leave because 
   all the doors and windows are locked and Achille says doesn't have 
   the keys. Stefano gets Rossana alone and tries to put the bite on 
   her, but he fails when Aldo (Aldo Nicodemi, as &quot;Boris 
   Notarenko&quot;; who perished in a car accident before this film was 
   released), Rossana's sometimes boyfriend, appears and takes her away. 
   Stefano then tells Julia that her name is actually Laura, his long 
   lost love who betrayed him, and when she denies it, he bites her on 
   the neck and locks her in his coffin. When the company go looking for 
   Julia, they open the coffin and find Julia's clothes on top of 
   Stefano's black tie and tails, but no Julia. Achille tells Sandro 
   that Laura was a medium, one of many who came to the theater a 
   hundred years ago to study the strange phenomena that was happening 
   there. Laura died in the theater, but before she passed away, she 
   said that in a space of a hundred years her soul would find another 
   body to occupy. Only through reincarnation will the forces of evil 
   that live in Stefano be destroyed. Sandro believes Achille is insane, 
   so he ties him up.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Meanwhile, Julia and Stefano are in in the gateway to Stefano's 
   alternate dimension, where all his prevoius female victims are 
   chained to a wall, baring their fangs. Stefano tells Julia he comes 
   here to kill his previous victims over and over just for the 
   enjoyment of it and vows to kill Julia/Laura for revenge, once again 
   threatening to kill her with a pitchfork. Julia runs away and ends up 
   back in the theater, but she tells Sandro she can't remember 
   anything. Julia hears a tied-up Achille screaming out Laura's name 
   over and over, so she gently places Achille's head against her 
   stomach. When she looks down, Achille's head is nothing but a skull 
   and his body is now a skeleton! Has Laura's soul taken over Julia's 
   body? In the film's most lunatic sequence, the company does a final 
   rehearsal and let me say this: By what I saw on-screen, this is one 
   dance show that I would gladly pay to see and I hate dance shows! It 
   is a delirius hodge-podge of people dancing spastically and 
   cunvulsively, as if possessed (or having a mass orgasm!), while <A HREF="monster_of_the_opera_1964.htm#BulgingEyes">Stefano
    watches wild-eyed</A>, baring his fangs. Then, everyone stops 
   dancing in unison, as if frozen, while Stefano grabs Rossana and 
   Julia/Laura follows them, calling out Stefano's name. Stefano drags 
   Rossana back to his private alternate dimension and kills her with 
   the pitchfork, while Julia enters the dimension by jumping into 
   Stefano's portrait hanging on the wall! Stefano burns the portrait 
   and enters the dimension where <A HREF="monster_of_the_opera_1964.htm#SandroStefanoFight">he

    If you are a fan of Renato Poselli's films, as I am, you know what 
   to expect here; wall-to-wall weirdness with a minimum of plot 
   (screenplay by Polselli and Ernesto Gastaldi [<B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#HorribleDrHitch1962">THE
    HORRIBLE DR. HICHCOCK</A></B> - 1962; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#WhipAndTheBody1963">THE
    WHIP AND THE BODY</A></B> - 1963], with uncredited help by Giuseppe 
   Pellegrini, who also co-wrote <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#VampireBallerina60">THE
    VAMPIRE AN THE BALLERINA</A></B> with Polselli and Gastaldi). This 
   film features overt lesbianism, one of the first Italian genre films 
   to outright display it without trying to hide it creatively, like 
   many films that came before it. There's also many shots that feature 
   the female dancers in a minimum amout of clothing, the camera 
   specifically zooming in on their asses and crotches as they raise 
   their legs above their heads. It's like watching a softcore sex film 
   without any outright nudity, but your mind with think you saw some. 
   When this film was finished, it was slated to be released in the 
   United States, but since it wasn't dubbed in English, it was quickly 
   dropped from U.S. distribution, because no one back then wanted to 
   watch a subtitled film in theaters (many people still feel the same 
   way today, the fools!). It should also be noted that if the <A HREF="monster_of_the_opera_1964.htm#OST">music
    soundtrack</A> sounds familiar, it's because Aldo Piga (<B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#TerrorCreatures1965">TERROR-CREATURES

    OF THE VAMPIRES</A></B> (1962) as a favor to Polselli, to keep costs 
   down. This basically unseen film is a great treat for fans of Italian 
   Gothic horror, as it is weird, wild and full of the kind ot things we 
   usually don't see in films of this type from the early-'60s, thanks 
   to the gonzo antics of Renato Polselli, one of the unsung geniuses of 
   Italian genre cinema. Don't worry, I'll tell you where you can find

   (1987) -</B> A trio of overage punks, called The Cole Gang, go on a 
   crime spree. They start by slitting the throat of an old man leaving 
   a grocery store, then stealing a car (after knifing the female driver 
   and rifling through her purse) and finally raping the girlfriend of a 
   med student (Michael Lunsford). After talking to the cops at the 
   hospital, the girl is killed by the leader of the gang (disguised as 
   a doctor) by graphically slitting her stomach open with a scalpel and 
   pulling out her intestines. Vowing revenge, the med student and a 
   couple of his school buddies, after listening to the Jewish legend of 
   the Golem (!), decide<A HREF="monstrosity_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/monstrosity-graverobbers dvd front small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="194" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   to build their own creature to track down and kill the Cole Gang. Now 
   this is when it begins to get weird. The med students steal a torso, 
   the head of a pervert and the arm and leg of a gorilla (!), stitch 
   them all together and bring to life a creature they dub 
   &quot;Frankie&quot; (Hal Borske), after Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. 
   Up until Frankie's creation, this film is played dead-serious. During 
   the creation, the flick turns into a broad comedy and stays that way 
   for the rest of the film. Once Frankie comes to life, he's portrayed 
   more like a retarded child than a killer and the med students try to 
   teach him to kill by showing him Stallone and Schwarzeneggar posters! 
   The Cole Gang first meet Frankie as they are killing a pimp (throat 
   slashing) and his second-in-command (run over by a car). Frankie cut 
   the hand off one of the gang (the other two get away) with a meat 
   cleaver and saves one of the prostitutes, Jaimie Lee Curtis Wochieski 
   (Carrie Anita), who he brings home. They fall in love (She says, 
   &quot;You wanna nail me, Frankie?&quot;) and Frankie finds out that 
   he leaks blood from his stitches when he gets aroused or angry (I 
   promise I'm not making this up.). The rest of the film documents 
   Frankie's destruction of the Cole gang, his romance and marriage to 
   Jaimie and meeting his guardian angel, Angelo 10, who goes on an 
   anti-abortion tirade that must be heard to be believed. As the med 
   students become power-mad, there's a truly head-scratching finale 
   that will leave you saying, &quot;What the HELL?&quot; This is the 
   first of a trio of films that director Andy Milligan made before 
   succumbing to A.I.D.S. in 1991. The other two films were <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Weirdo">WEIRDO:

   1988). <B>MONSTROSITY</B> mixes gags with gore (decapitations, throat 
   slashings, appendage and organ removals and a large nail hammered 
   into someone's forehead) for an uneasy mixture. The tonal switch from 
   seriousness to juvenile comedy throws the viewer for a loop and the 
   film never recovers. The DVD liner notes state that Milligan filmed 
   the second half of the film first and only filmed the first half when 
   he knew he would get a distribution deal. This would explain the 
   fractured narrative. The film looks like it was filmed on short ends 
   (a Milligan trademark) as the color and focus shifts from scene to 
   scene. This is not essential Milligan (but what is?) although it is 
   good for a retarded laugh here and there. The effects are quite 
   graphic but are laughable in their execution (another Milligan 
   trademark). Also starring Joe Balogh and David Homb. Produced by Lew

   a warehouse owned by funeral parlor director Hank Andrews 
   (Christopher George; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Pieces">PIECES</A></B> 
   - 1982). Josh is an ex-employee of Andrew's funeral home and is owed 
   money, so he decides to steal a couple of tires as payment. Greg and 
   Josh hear some chanting coming from another room and they spot Hank, 
   Christie's mother Eve (Lynda Day George, who also starred in <B><A HREF="pieces_1982b.htm">PIECES</A></B> 
   and was Christopher George's wife until his untimely death in 1983) 
   and some other women all dressed in black-hooded robes performing 
   some type of ritual. Greg watches the action while Josh grabs the 
   tires, noticing the arm of Hank's wife (Donna Garrett), who 
   supposedly committed suicide, sticking out of a casket on the 
   warehouse floor. Josh is then brutally murdered with a huge embalming 
   needle by someone in a black robe, shoving the needle into Josh's 
   stomach until it comes out his back. When Greg returns, he notices 
   his van and Josh are<A HREF="mortuary_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mortuary 1983 reverse dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   gone, so he calls Christie to come pick him up. Sheriff Duncan (Bill 
   Conklin) finds Greg's van and comes to the conclusion that Josh left 
   town because he was prone to do such things. Greg agrees, but Hank 
   spotted Greg at the warehouse, which puts a damper on Greg's parents' 
   florist business. Back at high school, Beethoven-loving Paul Andrews 
   (the late Bill Paxton, in one of his earliest roles), Hank's son, 
   pines for Christie and asks her if she wants to hear the newest 
   Beethoven album he bought, but Greg appears and puts a damper on the 
   date. That night, Christie sleepwalks right into her pool and wakes 
   up to find that a black-hooded person is trying to kill her with that 
   damn embalming needle (The print is so clear on this DVD, that you 
   can actually see who the killer is!). Christie's mother doesn't 
   believe her, which causes friction between them. Greg does believe 
   her and finally confesses that he saw her mother with Hank performing 
   some kind of ritual. They follow her one night, only to discover that 
   Hank, Eve and the other women Greg saw earlier are performing a 
   seance, trying to contact Christie's father. They do contact him and 
   discover that he was actually murdered. Eve fesses-up to Christie 
   that Paul once asked her father if he could marry Christie, but Dr. 
   Parson recommended to Hank that his son be committed to a mental 
   institution. Hank refused, saying that he would keep a closer eye on 
   him. Well, he failed his duty. Paul sneaks into Christie's home and 
   kills Eve by stabbing her over-and-over in the stomach with the 
   embalming needle. After a lengthy chase, Paul captures Christie and 
   knocks her out, putting both her and Eve's corpse in his station 
   wagon. As he is driving away from the house, Greg notices his car and 
   follows him back to the funeral home. Paul strips Christie naked (an 
   obvious body double since we never see Mary McDonough's face when the full-frontal
    nudity is shown), sedates and is about to embalm her (This way, he 
   can have her forever!), when Hank suddenly appears and Paul shows him 
   what he has done. Hank is appalled and tells Paul that he should have 
   listened to Dr. Parson and committed him. Paul stabs Hank in the 
   stomach with the embalming needle, killing him, just as Greg enters 
   the funeral parlor. Paul locks Greg in a room and takes off with the 
   bodies of Hank, Eve and a still-living Christie, bringing them to the 
   warehouse, where he also has the bodies of Dr. Parson and his mother 
   sitting in chairs. He plans on embalming Christie and then marrying 
   her in front of all the stiffs. Greg finds an axe and breaks out of 
   the locked room, driving quickly to the warehouse (How did he know to 
   go there?) and stopping Paul from embalming Christie just in the nick 
   of time. A fight ensues and Paul gets the upper hand, but a 
   sleepwalking Christie rises from the embalming table, picks up the 
   axe and plants it into Paul's back. Thinking that they are now safe, 
   we quickly learn that Paul's mother didn't commit suicide and is 
   quite alive. She rises from her chair with a knife in her hands and 
   screams, the film ending while freezing on her obviously psychotic 
   face. This is nothing special, but it is a perfectly fine way to

   Director Dario Argento finally completes his &quot;Three Mothers&quot;
    trilogy, first started with <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Suspiria1977">SUSPIRIA</A></B> 
   (1977) and then followed by <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Inferno1980">INFERNO</A></B> 
   (1980). I'm glad to report that this is Argento's finest film in the 
   past 20 years, but with some reservations. A crew digging a new grave 
   in a cemetery uncover a coffin with a strange rectangular urn chained 
   to it. A priest <A HREF="mother_of_tears_2007.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mother of tears poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="185" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>dates
    the coffin and urn to 1815 and he reburies the coffin on blessed 
   ground, but not the urn. He takes the urn home with him and when he 
   opens it, he is horrified by what he sees. He reseals the urn in 
   church candle wax and ships it off to his friend Michael Pierce (Adam 
   James), an archaeologist at a museum in Rome. The urn is unwittingly 
   intercepted by museum workers Sarah Mandy (Asia Argento) and Giselle 
   Mares (Coralinda Cataldi-Tassoni) and in their haste to open it, 
   Giselle cuts herself and bleeds on the urn. Uh-oh! When they open the 
   urn, they find an ancient dagger, three stone idols and a red robe 
   with strange symbols adorning it. While Sarah is off getting a book 
   to decipher the writings, a monkey and three robed figures appear, 
   killing Giselle (what they do to her mouth is simply painful to 
   watch) and tearing her body apart. Sarah returns, only to be chased 
   by the monkey, but an unseen force helps Sarah escape (we hear a 
   disembodied female voice say, &quot;Leave now!&quot;). When Sarah 
   reports what she saw to police detective Enzo Marchi (Cristian 
   Solimeno), he and the other cops laugh at her (especially when she 
   mentions the monkey), but Marchi knows that there is more to the 
   story, so he keeps a close eye on her. While Sarah and Michael (who 
   are lovers) try to unlock the secrets of the urn, a rash of violent 
   suicides and murders infect Rome that have the police baffled (a 
   mother throws her baby off a bridge; people stab and pummel each 
   other on the streets for no apparent reason). Michael is told that 
   the urn contained the spirit of Mater Lachrymarum, the &quot;Mother 
   of Tears&quot;, a demon that brings nothing but sadness and death 
   wherever she goes. The bad news is that Mater Lachrymarum has 
   reincarnated herself into the body of a young woman (Moran Atias, who 
   spends the majority of her screen time in the nude) and she has had 
   her minions kidnap Michael's young son to keep him quiet. Sarah seems 
   to be the only person able to battle this ancient evil and, with the 
   help of the unseen female voice (which turns out to be her dead 
   mother [portrayed by Asia's real-life mother, Daria Nicolodi], who 
   teaches her how to be invisible!), she sets out to find Michael (who 
   has disappeared) and put an end to the madness that is spreading 
   throughout the land, while trying to avoid the police, who want to 
   arrest her for murder. Along the way, Sarah learns the truth about 
   the mysterious death of her mother. That knowledge will help Sarah 
   battle the evil which hopes to bring about the &quot;Second Coming Of 
   Witches&quot; and, believe me, no one wants that to happen except the 
   evil forces which look to enslave and kill all humanity. Lots of gory 
   mayhem follows.&nbsp; Here's my biggest complaint about this film: 
   Asia Argento doesn't have the talent to pull-off a demanding role as 
   the one she has to play here. Frankly, she doesn't have the range for 
   such a complex role and half the time she looks like she's 
   sleepwalking through the film. It's especially annoying when she has 
   to display different emotions in the same scene and all she can 
   muster is the look of someone passing a kidney stone or experiencing 
   a case of hard gas. It's downright embarrassing at times (watch the sce<A HREF="mother_of_tears_2007.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mother of tears poster1a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="177" HEIGHT="232" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ne
    where she cries out &quot;Mommy! Mommy!&quot; and try not to laugh). 
   Dario has got to cut the apron strings and start once again using 
   stronger actresses as leading ladies (In my opinion, Asia also ruined 
   Dario's <B><A HREF="stendhal_syndrome_1996.htm">THE STENDHAL SYNDROME</A></B> 
   [1996] with the same one-note acting). Now on to the good stuff: 
   Dario fills the film with many gory set-pieces, much of it dealing 
   with some sort of head trauma. Skulls are crushed, eyed are poked or 
   popped-out of their sockets, Udo Kier (in a cameo) has his face 
   chopped to pieces with a meat cleaver and even the poor baby gets 
   it's head caved-in when thrown off the bridge. There's also plenty of 
   other violence, too, including throat-slittings, stabbings, 
   tendon-slicing, limb-hacking, a skinning and a nasty scene where a 
   woman has a pole thrust-up her snatch until it exits out her mouth 
   (shades of <B><A HREF="cannibal_holocaust_1980.htm">CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST</A></B> 
   [1980]), all supplied by Italian effects expert Silvio Stivaletti. 
   There's also some effective tracking shots (an Argento staple), 
   plenty of nudity, a pit of sludgy body parts (which will give your 
   gag reflex a good workout), a decent music score by Claudio Simonetti 
   and very little CGI, although some of the fire effects, the death of 
   Mater Lachrymarum and the final scene in the film are obvious CGI 
   creations (I'm still trying to decide if the final scene was 
   purposely done in CGI, though. You'll have to see it to understand 
   what I'm talking about.). Some of the dialogue seems a little forced 
   (it was filmed in English and some of the Italian actors look to be 
   speaking English phonetically) and some of the situations are a 
   little too pat (I groaned out loud when Sarah threw her cell phone 
   out the car window simply because she couldn't get in touch with 
   Michael) or familiar (some scenes reminded me of John Carpenter's <B><A HREF="prince_of_darkness_1987.htm">PRINCE
    OF DARKNESS</A></B> [1987]), but <B><A HREF="mother_of_tears_2007b.htm">MOTHER

   today. If you weren't impressed with Argento's later films, including <B><A HREF="phantom_of_the_opera_1998.htm">PHANTOM

   completely unedited European version. Sure enough, the R-Rated

    HOME MASSACRE</A><A NAME="MotorHomeMassacre"></A> (2005) -</B> This 
   film reminds me of the time I went to Florida with my first ex-wife 
   and her family in an RV during the late 70's. Yeah, it's that 
   painful. A group of overage teenagers hop in a vintage motor home for 
   a vacation in the woods. As you can probably guess, a masked madman 
   begins killing them off one-by-one (using that old standby, a 
   machete). After what seems to be an eternity of &quot;character

   broods about her recent breakup with live-in boyfriend of two years 
   (and lots of flashbacks documenting the breakup) and a hillbilly 
   shopkeeper (Lane Morlote) relates a story to the kids about recent 
   killings in the woods, the dumb-as-a-bag-of-rocks gang finally settle 
   in to their campground. That night, the group meets black girl Nicole 
   (Tanya Fraser) and her dog Lulu. Nicole, who was with another couple 
   in the beginning of the film just before they were slaughtered (she <A HREF="motor_home_massacre_2005.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/motor home massacre dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ran
    away when they wanted to have a three-way with her), keeps getting 
   angry phone calls from her weird-sounding jealous ex-boyfriend 
   telling her that he's going to kill the people around her (We never 
   hear her phone ring, which I first thought was laziness on the 
   filmmaker's end, but it turns out to be a big clue). The group is 
   then attacked by two drunken rednecks, but nerd Benji (Justin Geer) 
   chases them off with a machete. Benji then walks Nicole back to her 
   campsite, kisses her and a couple of minutes later, she gets another 
   call from her ex threatening Benji's life. A nightvision goggle-wearing
    madman dressed in black then begins chopping and stabbing the cast 
   with a machete. After murdering nearly the entire cast, the killer 
   goes one-on-one against Sabrina and she beans the killer three times 
   across the head with a frying pan (complete with exaggerated sound 
   effects). The finale finds the survivors hitting one more roadblock 
   on their way to freedom. Please God, kill me too!&nbsp; This 
   bottom-of-the-barrel DTV horror flick, directed by one-shot wonder 
   (so far) Allen Wilbanks (who also scripted), is so poor that some of 
   the scenes are shot with a camera lens that has an annoying visible 
   smudge in the upper right-hand corner. I can forgive one scene with 
   the smudge, but there are several, including a black-and-white 
   flashback, so I imagine that an entire day's shooting took place with 
   this defect and rather than reshoot the footage, they just hoped that 
   the viewer wouldn't notice. It didn't work. This is nothing but a 
   series of fart, nose picking and horny teenage sex jokes, punctuated 
   by some of the worst gore I have ever laid eyes on (The blood is 
   bright day-glo red and reminded me of the blood used in 60's &amp; 
   70's horror films). <B>MOTOR HOME MASSACRE</B> also has the 
   distinction of being populated with some of the most annoying actors 
   I have ever had the displeasure of watching. The two most annoying 
   are Todd Herring as Lincoln, a white boy who thinks he's black and 
   uses the words &quot;nigger&quot; and &quot;bitch&quot; in nearly 
   every sentence, and Justin Geer as Benji, the sweater vest-wearing 
   driver of the RV whose teeth are so big, I really don't think he can 
   close his mouth. This is also one of the sloppiest made films that I 
   have ever seen, as camera shadows are frequently in view, the sound 
   recording fluctuates from shot-to-shot and there are flubbed lines 
   aplenty (not to mention some of the most headache-inducing editing, 
   like watching action through a strobe light). While I'm still glad 
   that low-budget horror films are still being made and distributed 
   (see my review for <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BloodyMurder2">BLOODY 
   MURDER 2</A></B>), it's films like this that can kill the genre for 
   good. Much like a real RV that's been on a long trip without any 
   stops, this film is full of shit. I honestly can't think of one good 
   thing to say about this film. It's that bad. Oh, and that chainsaw 
   that's so prominently displayed on the DVD cover? Nowhere to be found 
   in the film. Also starring Nelson Bonilla, Breanne Ashley, Greg 
   Corbett, Diana Picallo, West Cummings and Sande McGhee as a

   New Guinea that was not sanctioned by the British government. Consul 
   member Burns (Lanfranco Spinola) wants to know the reason for the 
   expedition, but neither Susan or Arthur know. One man who may know is 
   Professor Edward Foster (Stacy Keach; <B><A HREF="street_people_1976.htm">STREET
    PEOPLE</A></B> - 1976), who tells Susan that Henry did contact him 
   about going along on the expedition, but he was very secretive about 
   why he was going, so Edward turned down his offer. Edward has an idea 
   where Henry was headed, a mountain jungle area, where it is said to 
   contain cannibal tribes and is cursed, anyone not a tribe member who 
   dares step foot on the land ends up missing (and probably dinner!). 
   Susan hires Edward to take herself and Arthur to New Guinea to search 
   for Henry.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    As soon as they touch down by helicopter, the trouble starts. No 
   locals will go with them on their expedition and Susan is nearly 
   bitten by the world's most poisonous spider. After they watch local 
   tribe members skin a live lizard and eat its innards (real-life 
   animal deaths being a Italian cannibal genre staple), they begin 
   their expedition. It is obvious that Edward has an ulterior motive 
   for going on this expedition, but he is keeping it to himself (Arthur 
   tells Susan that he doesn't trust him). After taking a rubber raft 
   trip to the island containing the mountain jungle, they discover the 
   partially devoured bodies of Henry's guides and Susan finds his 
   knife. We then watch footage of a snake crushing a monkey's head with 
   its jaws and swallowing it whole (Why do Italian filmmakers think 
   this is entertaining? This scene was shot especially for this film 
   and Martino says it was unplanned, but footage shows that the monkey 
   was forced to confront the snake! What did they think was going to 
   happen?), our intrepid trio (plus four guides they paid handsomely) 
   set up base camp. When they wake up the next morning, one of their 
   guides is missing. Edward says they should turn back, but Susan wants 
   to proceed, saying finding her husband is the utmost priority. Taking 
   a bamboo raft down river, they lose another guide when an alligator 
   bites off his arm and drags him into the river. They then trek 
   through the jungle and we can see that they are being watched&nbsp; 
   by unknown tribesmen wearing ugly wooden masks. They lose another 
   guide to a jungle booby trap, where he is pulled up in the air by a 
   rope and impaled on bamboo spikes. Their last guide runs away in 
   fear, only to get his head lopped off by a masked tribesman swinging 
   a primitive axe.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   tells Susan that her husband was taken prisoner by the Puka Tribe, 
   the same tribe that kidnapped Edward six years earlier, eventually 
   making him a member of their tribe. Oh, and they are cannibals. Does 
   that mean Edward is one, too? Edward tells Manolo that he was forced 
   to eat human flesh and he hated it, as it still haunts his dreams 
   every night. Is he telling the truth or is there another reason why 
   he is on this expedition?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Members of the Puka Tribe secretly sneak onto the mission grounds 
   and watch as Susan gets undressed, never seeing a white woman before 
   and they are intrigued (so am I!!!). Edward catches them peeking and 
   they run away, Edward telling Manolo that he recognized some of them. 
   Susan asks Manolo to take her to the Puka Tribe's village, just the 
   two of them, as she doesn't trust Arthur or Edward, telling Manolo 
   that something is going on between the two that she doesn't 
   understand. That night, at Father Moses' mission, a local girl that 
   Arthur is sleeping with is speared in the back by a Puka tribesman 
   and Edward is seriously slashed in his leg by another tribe member. 
   Father Moses throws all of them out of his mission and tells them 
   never to come back (How dare Arthur sleep with one of his flock!), so 
   they all travel to the Puka Tribe's village. When Edward's leg 
   becomes infected (Manolo puts some jungle worms on the wound to suck 
   out the infection), he finally confesses on why he is so eager to 
   continue. There is a fortune in diamonds in Puka Tribe territory and 
   he tells Susan that is the reason Henry went there, to be rich beyond 
   his wildest dreams. Susan refuses to believe it, still thinking that 
   her husband is a saint. The foursome travel travel ahead, battling 
   river rapids, cobras and hiking up a slippery waterfall, losing one 
   of their members to an act of greed, until they reach their goal. 
   Does Susan find her husband? Do they all become wealthy? Well, if you 
   were a tribe member and you saw a naked Ursula Andress, what would 
   you do?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   red blood and human flesh (both exposed and eaten) on view. Seeing 
   Ursula Andress completely naked (no body doubles here, as the camera 
   reveals) is both eye-opening and unlike most of her other film

   and another member fucking a giant boar (!), all scenes missing from 
   the R-Rated cut. One member even tries to take Andress from behind, 
   until the tribe's chief punishes him by cutting off his pecker (shown

   (gross), Manolo being forced to eat human flesh and other depravity 
   on view (including a dwarf tribe member enjoying the taste of flesh), 
   culminating in the film's standout sequence, which is best for you to 
   witness for yourself (needless to say, the Dwarf's noggin pops like a

    Evelyn (Anna Chappell) is a former state mental patient who may be

   witchcraft in the basement. She covers up the murder to make it look 
   like an accident and gets away with it, although the Sheriff (James 
   Bradford) is suspicious. She then resumes her duties as the 
   owner/operator of the Mountainside Motel, and out-of-the-way dive in 
   the Louisiana backwoods. Evelyn hears voices telling her that people 
   know she is crazy which leads her to torment and kill the occupants 
   that are unlucky enough to be spending the night at her run-down 
   establishment. The residents at the motel are the standard horror 
   film stereotypes: A newlywed couple; a couple of female cousins who 
   are country singer wannabes; Reverend Bill (horror film vet Bill 
   Thurman), a preacher with an alcohol problem; a businessman named Al 
   (Will Mitchell) who happens to be a record producer (or is he?); and 
   Crenshaw (Major Brock), an out of work carpenter who can still swing 
   a mean hammer. Using the secret underground passageways that connect 
   all the rooms, Evelyn begins dispatching the roomers, first 
   antagonizing them with snakes, rats and roaches and then going 
   full-bore bonkers, using her sickle to kill everyone that crosses her 
   path. In one stormy night, Evelyn throws away all that good 
   psychiatric care she received to satisfy those pesky voices in her 
   head. Al and Crenshaw band together to get Evelyn before she gets 
   them, but Crenshaw ends up losing a hand (then his life) before 
   Evelyn loses her head in a fight with the Sheriff, who has come to 
   save the day. Not much in the way of entertainment here, unless your 
   idea of fun is bad acting and cheap gore effects. Father/son team of 
   Jim McCullough (director &amp; producer) and Jim McCullough Jr. 
   (screenwriter &amp; co-producer) had been churning out cheap regional 
   films in many genres throughout the 70's and 80's, including <B><A HREF="charge_of_the_model_ts_1976.htm">THE

   the cheapness of the entire production, including questionable acting 
   from nearly all the cast members, you may find yourself having a good 
   time with this strange horror flick. Ten years ago, Holland Price 
   (stuntman/actor Brad Loree, who looks like a young Richard Moll and 
   played Michael Myers in <B><A HREF="halloween_resurrection_2002.htm">HALLOWEEN:
    RESURRECTION</A></B> - 2002) was a loving father of young daughter 
   Amy and devoted husband to beautiful wife Julie (Jessica Cameron). On 
   Halloween Night, the last visitor to ring the doorbell to the Price 
   household is Father Flannagan (Edward X. Young; <B><A HREF="mega_man_2009.htm">MEGA
    MAN</A></B> - 2009, who bears a striking resemblance to a young 
   Zacherle), who assures Holland that he is not wearing a costume and 
   that his bus (which he says is full of orphans) conked out about a 
   half mile away. He wants to use the phone to call for help, but first 
   needs to use the bathroom. The next time we see Father Flannagan, he 
   is holding a butcher knife to Julie's throat and slashes it in front 
   of Holland. Amy ends up missing and <A HREF="mr_hush_2011.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mr. hush dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="167" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Father
    Flannagan gets away, promising they will meet again before he knocks 
   out Holland. Cut to the present and Holland (now with long gray hair) 
   is living in a tent next to new buddy Mac (Steve Dash), making money 
   working as a dishwasher and waiter at a bar/restaurant with fellow 
   waitress Debbie (Connie Giordano). Mac wants Holland to put down 
   roots and settle down with Debbie and her daughter Kat (Alexis 
   Lauren), but Holland is sure that Amy is alive and never spends more 
   than two weeks in one place looking for her (that explains the tent). 
   Holland eventually falls in love with Debbie and gets along great 
   with Kat, but Father Flannagan rings the doorbell to Debbie's house, 
   slits Debbie's throat and ties Holland and Kat up in a basement, 
   where Flannagan's assistant, Stark (actor/former gay porn film star 
   Stephen Geoffreys; <B><A HREF="fright_night_1985.htm">FRIGHT NIGHT</A></B> 
   (1985); <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#DoNotDisturb2013">DO NOT DISTURB</A></B> 
   (2008/2013), who overacts here to the point of diversion for the 
   viewer) torments them verbally. Holland swears to Kat that they will 
   get free and calls Flannagan &quot;Mr. Hush&quot;, because he likes 
   to sing the song &quot;Hush Little Baby&quot;. Holland and Kat watch 
   as Hush and Stark bring in some unknown girl, tie her to a table and 
   slowly drain her of blood by putting a tube in her arm and letting 
   her blood drain into a bowl. Holland and Kat finally get free and 
   while Kat goes to get the police, Holland searches the house to kill 
   Hush. He manages to kill Stark and finds his now-teenage daughter Amy 
   (Megan Heckman) in one of the upstairs bedrooms, but Mr. Hush has a 
   hold on her and demands she goes back to her bedroom. She does just 
   that and Holland demands to know why Hush has such a hard-on for him: 
   Hush explains that in the 1930's, he and his wife were out for a 
   midnight stroll looking for dinner when Holland's grandfather lost 
   control of his car, crashed into a picket fence and one of the 
   pickets flew in the air and impaled Hush's wife in the heart, killing 
   her. Since Hush looks no older than 45, it soon becomes apparent that 
   Hush and his wife were vampires and Hush swore that Holland's 
   bloodline would suffer a fate worse than death. Namely, he killed 
   Holland's grandparents, parents and makes Holland suffer by killing 
   everyone that he loves. Hush then shows his true colors (mainly 
   blue), as he transforms into a vampire with a full set of sharp upper 
   and lower teeth. Holland tries to hit him with a baseball bat, but it 
   just splinters when he hits Hush over the head with it. Just as he is 
   about to kill Holland, Hush is impaled with the sharp end of the 
   baseball bat, courtesy of Amy (Hush says, &quot;Isn't that funny? A 
   vampire killed with his own bat!&quot;) and he stumbles outside where 
   we hear the sound of bat wings flying away. A year later, Holland, 
   Amy, Kat and Mac are living peacefully in a house when the doorbell 
   rings. Mac goes to answer the door when the other three scream to 
   him, &quot;NO!!!!&quot;.&nbsp; While not a good film at all, it is 
   still an interesting one and director/screenwriter/executive producer 
   David Lee Madison (his first and, so far, only directorial effort) 
   works pretty well in the confines of what he has to work with; namely 
   a meager budget, non-professional actors (besides Geoffreys) and 
   limited locations and sets. There's not much blood spilled (just a 
   couple of slit throats, a knifing, threatening to cut off the head of 
   the unknown girl with a chainsaw [the film's biggest tease, because 
   Hush turns off the chainsaw just as we are expecting him to cut her 
   head off], a bloodless impalement and the aforementioned bleeding of 
   the unknown girl), but the story really doesn't demand it. There's a 
   stinger during the end credits that tries to emulate Geoffreys' final 
   line in <B><A HREF="fright_night_1985.htm">FRIGHT NIGHT</A></B> (Only 
   this time he says, &quot;Smells like chicken!&quot;, a line he says a 
   couple of times during the film proper when he sniffs people). 
   Speaking of Geoffreys, he has not progressed as an actor but actually 
   regressed, because his performance here is one of the worst in the 
   film (not to mention his prominent beer belly). He overacts to the 
   point of wanting to duct tape his mouth and chaining his legs 
   together, as he jumps and screams all over the place in one scene and 
   he is only reading a newspaper! I will give this film one positive 
   point and that is it is different from most ultra-low-budget DTV junk 
   being released today. That's not an endorsement, but you could do a 
   helluva lot worse. Also starring Thomas J. Churchill (as one of the 
   most worthless sheriffs committed to film), Tim Doughtery, Colleen 
   Cohan and Brian O'Halloran. A <A HREF="http://www.kinolorber.com">Horizon

   a veteran's hospital after sustaining serious facial injuries while 
   fighting in the Iraq War and is stuck in the middle of Manhattan 
   after the Mayor of NYC quarantines the whole island and shuts down 
   all subway service and public transportation. Casey must find a way 
   to get to her father without being bitten by the infected, while 
   Clutch becomes the guardian of Mulberry Street, trying to protect his 
   friends and neighbors until official help arrives. As they all begin 
   to get infected one-by-one, Casey finally makes it to her father, 
   only to end up fighting side-by-side next to Clutch as the invading 
   horde of rat zombies infect everyone floor-by-floor in the tenement 
   building. When the government forces finally show up (in bright 
   yellow haz-mat outfits), they prove to be no better than the rats, as 
   they kill anyone with the slightest amount of blood on their bodies, 
   infected or not. I'm glad to see that our taxpaying dollars are being 
   put to such good use.&nbsp; While there's a little too much 
   &quot;shakey-cam&quot; photography for my taste (the same type of 
   annoying technique used in <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Feast 2006">FEAST</A></B> 
   [2006; which this film reminds me a lot of] and many other modern 
   horror and action films), director/co-scripter Jim Mickle (this is 
   his first feature-length film) still manages to fashion a very 
   interesting horror film on an extremely low budget. What I find most 
   interesting are the parallels scripters Mickle and Damici use in 
   comparing the war in Iraq to the rat-zombie invasion of Manhattan. 
   Particularly effective is the plight of Casey, who just got done 
   fighting one war, which left her with permanent physical scars, only 
   to get caught-up in the middle of another one, which will leave her 
   with much worse scars, the kind you can never recover from. This is a 
   relentless, grisly film that doesn't take any prisoners. Some of the 
   most likeable characters meet gory demises (usually graphic bites), 
   only to return later as rat-zombies, scurrying on all fours as they 
   try to infect the rest of the cast. Some of the attack sequences are 
   particularly heart-wrenching, especially in the finale, as the 
   infected don't seem to lose all their humanity or past memories, yet 
   their hunger for human flesh takes precedence over their feelings for 
   their friends and family. Although I found the nihilistic ending to 
   be a bit too much (Do all modern horror films have to end on a bitter 
   note?), what comes before it is a refreshing new slant on the zombie 
   genre mixed with a wicked side-order of political angst. While <B><A HREF="mulberry_street_2007b.htm">MULBERRY

   every now and then (the CGI oxygen tank explosion being a glaring

   get a wide theatrical release. Why films like the headache-inducing <B><A HREF="cloverfield_2007.htm">CLOVERFIELD</A></B>

    &amp; DAD</A><A NAME="MumAndDad"></A> (2008) -</B> If people tell 
   you that the British are incapable of making good horror films any 
   more, point them in the direction of this film, a tense, terrifying 
   and utterly hilarious (in a totally black, black way) parable about 
   family mores and values taken to the extreme. Birdy (Ainsley Howard) 
   and her adopted brother, the mostly silent Elbie (Toby Alexander), 
   work on the night shift janitorial staff of London's Heathrow 
   Airport. Elbie strikes up a friendship with new staff member Lena 
   (Olga Fedori), a Polish immigrant who confides to Elbie that she 
   doesn't get along with her parents because they expected her life to 
   be different than it is. Birdie (who doesn't mind cleaning the worst 
   shit-stained toilets in the airport's bathrooms because she is 
   &quot;use to it&quot;) tells Lena that she and Elbie get along great 
   with their Mum and Dad because they work at the airport, too (There 
   is really no other jobs in the area for people of their 
   &quot;class&quot; than working at the airport). Birdie is the 
   talkative type who likes to nick items (like an MP3 player) from the 
   offices she and Lena clean, but Lena can't help but stare at the 
   multiple scars on Birdie's arms, which she calls &quot;war 
   wounds&quot; (Birdie confides to Lena that she had some 
   &quot;behavioral problems&quot; in the past, but she's<A HREF="mum_and_dad_2008b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/mum &amp; dad poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   better now). Lena misses her bus home at the end of her shift (thanks 
   to some trickery on Birdie's part), so Birdie and Elbie take her to 
   their parents' home, a ramshackle house at the end of one of the 
   airport's deserted runways. Lena is drugged and knocked-out and when 
   she wakes up, she's in a bedroom covered with bloodstained walls and 
   meets Mum (Dido Miles), who informs Lena that she is now a part of 
   their family and she must keep Dad (Perry Benson) calm, otherwise he 
   goes on bloody, murderous fits of rage. Mum drugs Lena again and when 
   she wakes up, she's chained to the ceiling while Mum pierces her skin 
   with a knitting needle asking, &quot;Are you my girl?&quot; Elbie 
   watches this horrorshow through a peephole in in the wall and 
   masturbates while Dad holds a knife to his throat and tells Elbie to 
   &quot;finish it!&quot; (Jerking-off, that is!). As Mum is slicing 
   Lena's back with a box cutter, calling her a &quot;precious gift from 
   Heaven&quot;, Birdie enters the room to deliver some tea and cookies 
   for Mum. Mum and Birdie bring a bloodied Lena to formally meet Dad 
   and when they get to his torture room, they all watch him masturbate 
   with what looks like a human liver (I swear, I almost threw-up!). Dad 
   lays down the rules (&quot;In this household, family is 
   everything!&quot;) and tells Lena to forget about the outside world 
   (&quot;It doesn't exist anymore!&quot;), do her chores and, most of 
   all, respect her new Mum, Dad, Sister and Brother. How in the world 
   is Lena going to escape this nuclear family from Hell? Lena gets her 
   chance on Christmas Day and it's about as bloody as you would expect 
   it to be. Revenge is the sweetest when it come from the tip of a 
   knife (at least in Lena's case).&nbsp; As directed and written by 
   first-time helmer Steven Sheil, <B><A HREF="mum_and_dad_2008b.htm">MUM
    &amp; DAD</A></B> is full of potent images that will shock even the 
   most jaded of horror film fans. While a general description of the 
   film may make it seem nothing more than &quot;torture porn&quot; 
   (God, I hate that term!), there is a lot more going on here both 
   visually and psychologically than any torture porn film I have seen 
   (and I've seen plenty). The whole ideal of an airport as a microcosm 
   of family life is an unusual take on a familiar horror convention 
   (Help for Lena is just an airport runway away, yet she might as well 
   be in the middle of the desert). It's really no different than the 
   plotlines of <B><A HREF="texas_chainsaw_massacre_1974.htm">THE TEXAS 
   CHAINSAW MASSACRE</A></B> (1974) or <B><A HREF="hills_have_eyes_1977.htm">THE
    HILLS HAVE EYES</A></B> (1977) and, just like those films, has a 
   unique perspective on what constitutes a &quot;family&quot;. Dad is a 
   fat slob who is also a sexual deviate. He works at the airport's 
   cargo section, stealing suitcases, bringing them home and making his 
   &quot;children&quot; sort out the contents as one of their 
   &quot;chores&quot;. Mum is even worse. Her sexual thrill is cutting 
   things, especially human flesh, and gets-off on cutting her 
   &quot;children&quot; with a variety of sharp objects, all while 
   professing her love for her &quot;Angel&quot; (her new name for 
   Lena). Birdie actually becomes jealous of alll the bloody attention 
   Mum &amp; Dad shower on Lena, even going as far as making Lena look 
   bad in Mum's eyes. Elbie is nothing more than a Dad-in-the-making, 
   which becomes evident in the scene where Dad stuffs Lena in a 
   suitcase and begins hitting her with a wooden mallet (a punishment 
   for trying to escape) and then hands the mallet to Elbie, who at 
   first is reluctant to hit her, but then gets into the swing of things 
   after a couple of direct hits. This is by no means an easy film to 
   watch and rightfully so. If you thought your family was fucked-up, 
   seeing what this family does may make you appreciate your's a little 
   bit more. The film is full of incest (even though it's highly 
   doubtful Birdie and Elbie are actually blood relatives of Mum &amp; 
   Dad); human body parts (Lena is forced to kiss the severed head of a 
   victim she is indirectly responsible for killing); lots of human 
   suffering and torture (I'll bet you all the money in the world that 
   you never spent a Christmas celebration like this family); and some 
   unusual set pieces (porn films play on the TV during breakfast at the 
   house!). This film is worth your time if you have a strong stomach 
   and one day it may be considered a classic of its genre. Also 
   starring Micaiah Dring and Mark Devenport. A Revolver Entertainment

    PARTY</A><A NAME="MurderParty2007"></A> (2007) -</B> In this clever 
   independent horror gore comedy (filmed in Brooklyn, New York), loner 
   Chris (Chris Sharp; one of this film's two Producers) plans to spend 
   Halloween Night alone with his cat watching rented horror VHS tapes 
   (with fake names such as <B>SCAREWOLF</B>) and eating candy corn out 
   of a bowl, but all that changes while he is walking home from the 
   video store and an ominous invitation to a &quot;Murder Party&quot; 
   appears on the sidewalk. Intrigued (the invitation says &quot;Come 
   Alone&quot;), Chris fashions a knight's costume out of a cardboard 
   box (it's quite funny), bakes a loaf of bread from a smashed pumpkin 
   found on his doorstep, Googles directions and hops on the subway 
   (where he is verbally accosted by a wannabe rapper) to attend the 
   party. After walking through some rough-looking back alleys, Chris 
   finally makes it to the party, which is located at some 
   out-of-the-way warehouse and is attended by a bunch of costumed 
   weirdos dressed in <A HREF="murder_party_2007.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/murder party dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="203" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>various
    Halloween costumes (19th Century vampire; the Darryl Hannah 
   character from <B><A HREF="blade_runner_1982.htm">BLADE RUNNER</A></B> 
   [1982]; a member of the Baseball Furies from <B><A HREF="warriors_1979.htm">THE
    WARRIORS</A></B> [1979]; etc). It seems poor Chris is the 
   unfortunate random victim picked by a group of pretentious friends 
   who decided to actually murder someone, all in the name of 
   &quot;art&quot;. They bound and gag Chris and begin to photograph and 
   videotape the proceedings, but they are so inept at doing the actual 
   murder, they prove more dangerous to themselves than to Chris. Sky 
   (Skie Saulnier; the film's other Producer) accidentally trips, hits 
   her head on a sledgehammer and dies of a massive bleeding head wound. 
   Macon (Macon Blair) douses Chris with what he thinks is deadly acid, 
   but it turns out to be nothing but a big bottle of vinegar. We then 
   learn that the leader, Alexander (Sandy Barnett), a really 
   pretentious asshole with a capital &quot;A&quot;, has gathered all 
   these people together with the promise of a $300,000 grant to the 
   person who can come up with the most creative death. Alexander and 
   his drug dealer sidekick Zycho (Bill Tangradi) makes everyone 
   shoot-up with sodium pentathol (truth serum) and they play a game of 
   &quot;Extreme Truth Or Dare&quot;, where secrets are revealed and 
   they begin to turn on each other. The finale finds Chris escaping 
   while everyone else is killing each other. He is chased by Bill 
   (William Lacey, who is dressed as one of the Baseball Furies) and 
   they end up at another even more bizarre Halloween Murder Party, 
   where Chris kills Bill by slicing his head with an electric chainsaw. 
   Chris then returns home to finish his night watching rented horror 
   tapes with his cat and eating candy corn out of a bowl. Just another 
   regular Halloween for Chris (from now on).&nbsp; While not a horror 
   film in the purest sense (it's more like a horror-themed <B><A HREF="big_chill.htm">BIG
    CHILL</A></B> [1983]-like ensemble piece), freshman feature 
   director/screenwriter Jeremy Saulnier has created a movie that's rich 
   in character development and surreal set pieces. The people here are 
   some of the most unlikable and pretentious (I know I've been using 
   this word a lot in this review, but in this case, it's a good thing) 
   &quot;artists&quot; that you will ever meet, yet you can't take your 
   eyes off the screen, because even though they spout the most 
   pretentious dialogue you are likely to ever hear, director Saulnier 
   leaves no doubt in our minds that they are going to get exactly what 
   they deserve (their &quot;just desserts&quot; if you like). When they 
   start turning on each other in the gore-filled finale, it's 
   unrelentlessly graphic and satisfying (The makeup effects, by co-star 
   Paul Goldblatt, are surprisingly good and refreshingly CGI-free). 
   Macon accidentally sets himself on fire while wearing a werewolf mask 
   and it melts onto his face, making him look like an actual werewolf. 
   Paul (Goldblatt), the photographer of the group, is graphically shot 
   in the head while taking the &quot;perfect&quot; shot with his 
   camera. Zycho has his leg cut-off with a chainsaw by Macon. Bill 
   plants an axe into Lexi's (Stacy Rock) head and then goes berserk 
   with the very same axe at another Halloween party while chasing 
   Chris, chopping-up a roomfull of revellers. Alexander (who, it turns 
   out, is a fake and a nobody who lives with his grandmother!) has his 
   face chewed-off by his pet dog Hellhammer (just after the dog ingests 
   a baggie of crank), the dog which Alexander planned on putting to 
   sleep because it is &quot;ugly&quot; (&quot;I only like puppies.&quot;
    is his explanation). Even Chris has his problems. He's taking 
   anti-depressants (and also works for the police department as a 
   civilian parking ticket agent!), but he throws away the pills when he 
   finds killing Bill with a chainsaw to be cathartic. My favorite scene 
   comes when Chris confesses (after being injected with the truth 
   serum) that he once shit his pants so bad after being stuck alone on 
   an elevator, that it ran down his legs and touched his socks! It's 
   not only howlingly funny, it also shows what a boring life Chris has 
   led up until this point, since it's the worst secret he's never told 
   anyone until now. This is a great debut feature film from 
   director/screenwriter Jeremy Saulnier, as it has a lot to say about 
   the mores and value differences between the &quot;artistic&quot; and 
   &quot;normal&quot; societies, yet it becomes clear the differences 
   are negligent when pitted against each other. The closing shot, where 
   Chris returns home covered in blood and has a face-off with his cat 
   (who is ultimately responsible for Chris making the decision to 
   attend this party in the first place), is priceless. Grab this one 
   when you get the chance. <B><A HREF="murder_party_2007b.htm">MURDER PARTY</A></B>

   needed about 85% of his film's running time to be made up of footage

   on home video, hopefully giving them more exposure than they would

    The film opens with the Hamilton family, father Richard (Gabriele 
   Tinti; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EerieMidnight1974">THE EERIE 
   MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW</A></B> - 1974), mother Nora (Adriana Russo; <B><A HREF="face_with_2_left_feet_1979.htm">THE
    FACE WITH TWO LEFT FEET</A></B> - 1979), teenage daughter Georgia 
   (Jessica Moore; <B><A HREF="escape_from_death_1989.htm">ESCAPE FROM DEATH</A></B> 
   - 1989) and young son Maurice (Edoardo Massimi), making a long drive 
   to Aunt Martha's house, a house that Richard hasn't been to since he 
   was a child. While Richard is driving, he has bad memories of 
   visiting his crazy Aunt Martha (Sacha M. Darwin) in the loony bin, 
   with his mother (Anna Maria Placido; <B><A HREF="massacre_1989.htm">MASSACRE</A></B> 
   - 1989) by his side and, when he comes back to reality, he almost 
   hits a truck head-on. Richard hasn't seen Aunt Martha for ages (She 
   been living in South America for the past 30 years) and he wants to 
   know why she wants to see him now, as her letter to him seemed 
   urgent, yet when they get to her house she isn't there. The only 
   person at the house is the creepy caretaker Thomas (Maurice Poli; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#FiveDolls1970">FIVE
    DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON</A></B> - 1970), who tells Richard that 
   Aunt Martha had some unfinished business and she won't be here until 
   early tomorrow morning (Richard then has another bad memory when he 
   was a child. His mother tells him a secret about Aunt Martha [we 
   don't hear what it is] and then commits suicide by jumping out the 
   window). Tomas takes the family on a tour of the house, but stops 
   Richard from opening the door to the basement, telling him that the 
   door is always kept locked, he doesn't have the key and it is not 
   safe to go down there.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That night, curiosity gets the best of Richard, so he tries to open 
   the basement door. To his surprise, he finds it unlocked, but before 
   he can go down to the basement, the phone rings and he goes to answer 
   it. No one is on the other end, the second such call of the night. 
   Nora finds it odd that Aunt Martha would be so excited to see Richard 
   after 30 years, yet she is not there to greet him when they arrived. 
   Richard says that's Aunt Martha, she's an odd woman, and then he 
   makes love to Nora (nudity alert). Someone sneaks into the house in 
   the middle of the night holding a shotgun and Richard discovers that 
   it is his other son Charles (Massimiliano Massimi) and then we 
   discover that Nora is the children's stepmother, as Richard was 
   married before (The way Charles talks about his mother, she was a 
   piece of work).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Morning comes and Aunt Martha still hasn't arrived. Charles can't 
   stay because he has important business to tend to and he leaves, 
   meeting Thomas outside. Thomas, who seems to know more about the 
   Hamilton family than they do themselves, tells Charles that Aunt 
   Martha phoned him last night to say she will not be here until 
   tomorrow. When Thomas tells the same thing to Richard, he finds it 
   odd that Aunt Martha didn't phone him with the news and Thomas says 
   she did, she tried calling twice, but no one picked up the phone.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That night, Richard is awoken by a door outside that is banging in 
   the breeze, so he goes outside to close it, not noticing Charles' 
   bloody, mutilated body hanging upside down from a tree. Maurice 
   begins acting strange, walking in a trance and acting all Carol 
   Ann-like in <B><A HREF="poltergeist_1982.htm">POLTERGEIST</A></B>

   this all mean and where is Aunt Martha?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The following morning, Georgia wakes up and discovers that her 
   full-length mirror has &quot;<B>June 16th 1958</B>&quot; written on 
   it, seemingly in blood. When Georgia mentions the date to her father, 
   it stirs something deep inside him, but he tells his daughter and 
   Nora that the date doesn't ring a bell (He secretly checks out the 
   mirror, finding the date smudged and blurry, as if someone tried to 
   erase it with their hand).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Still no Aunt Martha, so Richard takes a long stroll to Thomas' 
   cabin, while Nora takes the car and goes shopping, leaving the kids 
   alone in the house. That is never a good idea. Georgia takes a shower 
   (nudity alert) and someone stabs her in the middle of her forehead, 
   her mouth and various other parts of her body with a large butcher 
   knife, killing her. When Maurice hears her screams, he goes running 
   to her bathroom, only to have the black-gloved killer cut his head 
   off at the jaw line with a chainsaw! When Nora gets home, she can 
   find no one (missing a huge <A HREF="murder_secret_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/murder secret france dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="309" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>bloodstain
    on one of the walls!) and when Richard finally makes it to Thomas' 
   cabin, he discovers Thomas doesn't live there. As a matter of fact, 
   the person who lives at the cabin never heard of Thomas. Nora then 
   finds some medical files about Aunt Martha in a desk drawer and as 
   she is reading them (Aunt Martha was committed to the St. George 
   Mental Health Clinic on...<B>June 16th, 1958</B>!), the black-gloved 
   killer sneaks up behind her, grabs her head, puts it in one of the 
   desk drawers and slams it, cutting off her head! Richard calls the 
   St. George Clinic when he discovers there is no Thomas and what he 
   finds out will haunt until the day he dies, which may be sooner than 
   he thinks (The reveal was truly a surprise for me, so I won't spoil 
   it for anyone else, even though it a trope used in many modern horror 
   and supernatural films). Needless to say, when Richard gets back to 
   the house and discovers his family murdered, their bodies posed 
   around the dining room table, he finally realizes who he is and it's 
   not pretty. Can you guess what the murder secret is?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This is actually a pretty decent late-'80s Italian horror film, 
   probably the best film in the &quot;Lucio Fulci Presents&quot; line 
   of films that weren't directed by Fulci himself (<B><A HREF="touch_of_death_1988.htm">TOUCH

   relation to Andrea Bianchi, who directed and wrote <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Massacre1989">MASSACRE</A></B>.
    He obviously didn't have very much money to work with, yet the 
   killings are gory and very well done (Nearly all of the killings are 
   used in Fulci's <B><A HREF="cat_in_the_brain_1990c.htm">CAT</A></B>). 
   Gabriele Tinti is also very good, especially in the surprising 
   finale. Tinti would die in 1991 at the relatively young age of 59. He 
   was married to actress Laura Gemser (the <B><A HREF="emanuelle_films_1973-1983.htm">EMAN</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="emanuelle_films_1973-1983.htm">UE</A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><A HREF="emanuelle_films_1973-1983.htm">LLE</A></B><A HREF="emanuelle_films_1973-1983.htm"> series</A>)
    from 1976 until the day he passed (lucky bastard!). While this film 
   is not great by any stretch of the imagination, I liked that even the 
   smallest of details come into play in the surprising finale. To give 
   away any more would be to ruin the film for you if you decide to see 
   it. Warning: <B>SLIGHT SPOILER!!!</B> The &quot;surprise&quot; is 
   what happens in the beginning of the film. Better yet, what almost

   This is 2004's answer to an assault on your eyes and ears. It's 
   painful to watch, very hard to listen to and yet it is strangely 
   compelling for a film that really has nothing to say. A serial 
   killer, cannibal and fitness nut (Sven Garrett) is slaughtering women 
   in Las Vegas while posing as a photographer. Not just slaughtering 
   them, mind you, but raping them, driving nails through their hands 
   and chainsawing them in the head in his secret torture room in his 
   house (filled with dead rotting bodies and body parts). There's even 
   one really tasteless scene where we see him getting a blowjob in his 
   car by a decapitated head. When he is done, he simply throws the head 
   out the window! Everything is right there up on the screen and 
   nothing is left to the imagination. The serial killer is never given 
   a name (he is only known as &quot;The Photographer&quot; in the 
   credits) but we do know that his grandfather was a Nazi, he rants in 
   unsubtitled German while killing (bring along a German chick to 
   translate and see if she'll ever talk to you again) and <A HREF="murder_set_pieces_2004.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/murder-set-pieces dvd front small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>he
    considers all women as disposable trash. What little plot there is 
   consists of the little sister Jade (Jade Risser) of the woman who is 
   dating the killer. Jade has suspicions that he is not all there and 
   warns her sister to be careful when around him. The older sister just 
   thinks Jade has a vivid imagination. Bad move. When Jade confides to 
   her best friend that she knows that her sister's boyfriend is the 
   grandson of a Nazi and find him spying on her at school, The 
   Photographer stabs Jade's 10 year-old friend graphically in the 
   stomach in a bathroom in a public park, something I thought I would 
   never see in an American-made film. It's extremely hard to watch and 
   very bloody. Production notes state that over 30 gallons of fake 
   blood was used in making this film. It looks like it. The finale 
   finds Jade and The Photographer fighting each other in his hidden 
   killing room. She gets slashed repeatedly with a straight razor in 
   the back and she plants a pair of scissors in his stomach. They both 
   get away. Jade has terrible nightmares and The Photographer is seen 
   leaving town on a bus talking to a beautiful girl while taking her 
   picture. Director/writer Nick Palumbo is really a sick son-of-a-bitch 
   or a filmic genius. I still cannot make up my mind. There's enough 
   gore and nudity for a dozen horror films and takes chances that no 
   other U.S. horror film has taken in ages (killing kids on screen?). 
   His previous film, <B><A HREF="nutbag_2000b.htm">NUTBAG</A></B> 
   (2000), a SOV serial killer film, is similar in tone and plot but 
   does not have the production values (2.4 million dollars to make and 
   shot on 35mm) or the professionalism of <B><A HREF="murder_set_pieces_2004b.htm">MURDER-SET-PIECES</A></B>.
    Dozens of murders take place in this film (which led to some film 
   festivals refusing to show it and three film processing companies 
   refusing to handle it) and this is one of the goriest films in recent 
   memory. It's not for all tastes (I'm not even sure if I liked it, but 
   I couldn't take my eyes off it), so if you see this sucker (available 
   only on-line, forget WalMart!), think twice before you buy it. It 
   even got a run in <A HREF="murder_set_pieces_2004b.htm">theaters</A> 
   in New York and other select cities before hitting DVD. I would have 
   loved to see the peoples' reactions while watching this misogynistic 
   film on the screen. Sven Garrett (love those sideburns) carries the 
   film as he rants and raves in English and German and we are given 
   small flashbacks to him as a small boy as to why he hates women so 
   much.&nbsp; What this film lacks is a realistic touch. Sure, the 
   murders are extremely bloody, the nudity abundant and the tension is 
   so thick you can cut it with a knife, but the police are never shown 
   once investigating the murders (I was left wondering what happened 
   when someone found the severed head in the parking lot). Truth be 
   told, thousands of people disappear in Las Vegas every year, never to 
   be heard from again. It is Sin City after all. I can't really give 
   this film my recommendation because of it's subject matter (although 
   history has taught us that people like this do really exist), but I 
   can't really pan it either. It's slick and well-made with a great 
   music score. This film has turned my brain to Jello (the red cherry

    (don't know how it went from two to three and it's never explained) 
   and the fruit stand lady (who hasn't aged since 1959, but that's not 
   in the screenplay, just lazy casting). In a stroke of luck that only 
   happens in horror films, our hapless campers run into two cops that 
   they know and they stay with them as they camp out on the dangerous 
   property. It's not long before Leroy is killing the campers in 
   various bloody ways. Throats are torn, necks are snapped, arms are 
   bitten and, in what turns out to be the films coupe-de-grace, Leroy 
   rips the breasts off of one of the female campers in one pull and 
   eats them! The film is just a series of chases, as the campers try to 
   avoid the mutant's cannibal family, but they are mostly unsuccessful. 
   Of course the film is left wide-open for a sequel which, thankfully, 
   never materialized. Third rate in every way, <B>MUTANT MAN</B> is a 
   real exercise in tedium. The film is horrendously acted, especially 
   by the guy who plays Twitch (John Battaglia), as well as badly 
   scripted and directed. Did I forget to mention that this film is also 
   a comedy? Not all the time, mind you, just when 
   director/producer/writer Suzanne DeLaurentiis (best remembered as one 
   of the two actresses who was harassed by the hillbilly family in <B><A HREF="junior_1985.htm">JUNIOR</A></B> 
   - 1985) feels like it, as when one of the retarded cannibal brothers 
   chases two farm hands with a scythe around a field. Here's some 
   sample dialogue that's supposed to make me laugh: When one of the 
   campers spots a pentagram necklace around the sister's neck, she 
   says, &quot;That's a pretty necklace. Are you Jewish?&quot; 
   Hardee-fuckin'-har! It also name-drops various films, including <B><A HREF="deliverance_1972c.htm">DELIVERANCE</A></B> 
   (1972), <B>TCM</B> and <B><A HREF="shining_1980.htm">THE SHINING</A></B> 
   (1980). Leroy looks like a huge hillbilly with bad teeth (are there 
   any other kind?) and a pageboy wig, not very frightening at all, 
   especially since all he ever says is &quot;Aargh!&quot; over and 
   over. I will give it this, though: The film is very bloody. Besides 
   what I have already described, there's an arm thrust completely 
   through Twitch's stomach until it comes out his back (yay!), a nasty 
   knife through the neck, an even nastier leg breaking and other body 
   appendage mayhem, some of it done quite well. If that's all you're 
   looking for, I'm sure you will be pleased. But if farting, jokes 
   about rape and depictions of retards as comic relief turn you off, 
   expect to turn this off five minutes in. At least it was shot on 
   film, but I'm getting sick of filmmakers portraying New Jersey as a 
   state full of inbred hicks. I looked at my wife/sister and, by the 
   sound of her grunts and the amount of drool coming out of her mouth, 
   she agrees with me. This only goes to prove that women can direct 
   badly, too. Also starring Yvonne Buchanan, Charlie Patiro, Christian

   there, they find the condo unlocked and a bunch of liquor bottles 
   scattered about, like a party had just finished. Ed explains to his 
   friends that his father is a hunter and heavy drinker and shows them 
   his father's trophies and weapons. That's when Ed notices that a

    talk about having sex, romantic walks on the beach and games of 
   Monopoly (?), but why is Ed's father (Jack Chatham) hiding in a shed 
   in the back yard holding the battleaxe? Linda (Frances Raines) is 
   killed while skinnydipping in a pool and her boyfriend, Mike (Morey 
   Lampley), follows a trail of her clothes to the shed, where he is 
   disemboweled by an outboard motor operated by Ed's dad. He then hangs 
   both dead bodies by impaling their heads on spikes in a hidden room 
   in the shed. When the other four go looking for Mike and Linda, they 
   meet a cop (Ben Moore) on the beach. He tells them to be careful and 
   then goes snooping around the condo, only to be stabbed in the face 
   with a sword and then beheaded with the battleaxe. When Ralph (Bill 
   Hitchcock) goes to the shed to look for his missing friends, Ed Sr. 
   shoves a trident through his neck. When Sue (Connie Rogers) goes 
   looking for Ralph, Ed Sr. puts her on a table and shoves a gaffing 
   hook in her vagina until it exits out her stomach. He then chops her 
   head off. Ed Jr. is then impaled on the leg with the axe and Pam 
   (Ruth Martinez) stabs Ed Sr. in the chest with a knife. As they are 
   about to drive away, Ed Sr. jumps on the hood and Pam throws the car 
   into reverse, pinning him to a wall and cutting him in half. Ed Sr. 
   has one more bit of gory mayhem to perform before he passes away. Why 
   did kill all these people? Let's just say he was having a bad day 
   because the film gives you no concrete reason. This low-budget 
   slasher flick, directed/produced/scripted by one-shot wonder Buddy 
   Cooper, delivers on the gore (avoid the R-rated cut, as it edits out 
   nearly all the graphic bloodshed) but fails on nearly every other 
   level. It takes forever to get moving and there are more false scares 
   than actual ones. It seems the only false scare they didn't use was a 
   cat jumping out of nowhere. The gore is very graphic when it finally 
   comes and it lingers lovingly on gushing wounds, spilled innards, 
   dismembered body parts and impaled heads. The gaffing hook stunt is 
   particularly hard to watch and is only trumped by the finale where 
   Ed's father is cut in two. Nothing is left to the imagination and it 
   is downright nasty in it's execution (especially what happens to a 
   cop who checks on the body). The only recognizable names in the cast 
   are Frances Raines and Matt Mitler, who would both later co-star in

   fishing, swimming in the nude (not a pretty sight), masturbating 
   while watching his sister Anna (Marlene Lustik) taking a shower and 
   collecting mannequins and pretending they are his mother. Carl makes 
   friends with Tony (Paul Vincent), a drifter who nearly runs him over 
   with a motorcycle, and brings him home to meet his overprotective 
   sister. After a shaky start, Tony and Anna soon become fond of each 
   other and she convinces him to stay at the house for a few days (she 
   also loses her virginity to Tony at 28 years of age!). After 
   witnessing one of Carl's frequent nightmares (he dreams of his hanged 
   father coming to kill him), Tony decides to help Carl rid himself of 
   the bad dreams. Tony throws out all the things that remind Carl of 
   his mother, including her wheelchair and the mannequins. That doesn't 
   sit too well with Carl. He goes bonkers and kills the mailman with a 
   poker (the same weapon his father used on dear old mom) and buries 
   him in the backyard. He then stabs Tony and Anna while they lay 
   asleep in each other's arms. In the finale we learn that Anna was 
   involved in mom's death and helped dad dispose of the body. Carl 
   straps a mannequin on his back, takes off on Tony's motorcycle and 
   kills a cop on a high speed chase. He then stops at a pier, throws 
   the mannequin into the sea, slits his wrists, jumps off the pier and 
   gets eaten alive by sharks! The whacked-out ending aside, this is an 
   effective psychological chiller that is well acted and quite

   horror film which seems to condemn its core audience, but makes no 
   apologies because there are extenuating circumstances. Adam (Alexei 
   Ryan, who also sings a song on the soundtrack) is a horror 
   film-loving teen who is also a serial killer. Flashbacks show that 
   that his dying father (Mark Glasser), who was also an abusive husband 
   (the extenuating circumstance), got Adam hooked on horror films when 
   he was a child (while his father lays dying in his bed). It was their 
   only way of connecting and his father <A HREF="my_pure_joy_2011.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/my pure joy dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="171" HEIGHT="250" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>fills
    his head with such nonsense as, &quot;You can only get to people 
   through fear. If you want to impact somebody's life, you gotta 
   terrorize 'em!&quot; and &quot;These horror movies will stick with 
   you forever because you fear them.&quot; The first time we see Adam 
   in action, he is wearing all black with a hand-painted white mask, 
   killing a family who we just saw previously arguing at the dinner 
   table. Adam kills people using methods he learned while watching 
   horror films, except he puts his own spin on them. He first kills the 
   family's young son while he is sleeping in bed, stabbing him 
   repeatedly until he is nothing but a bloody mess. He then stuffs the 
   young boy in a pillowcase and finishes up the rest of the family, 
   culminating is stabbing the mother to death while she is taking a 
   shower (shades of <B><A HREF="psycho_1960.htm">PSYCHO</A></B> - 
   1960), then cutting off her nipples and placing them over her eyes 
   (something the Hitchcock film didn't do). Adam then goes home (where 
   he lives with his mother) and writes of his escapades in a journal. 
   He goes to the house of his best friends, the black Chris 
   (Christopher Chandler) and the white Steve (JD Fairman), who are both 
   brothers (Adam saves Steve from choking by performing the Heimlich 
   Maneuver). They discuss their love of horror films (where <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Martyrs">MARTYRS</A></B>

   film), drink beer and alcohol (Adam says to Chris while they are 
   drinking in a car, &quot;It's only a DUI if you get caught.&quot;) 
   and talk about who they are going to take to the prom. Adam wants to 
   ask Cindy (Kimberly Night) to the prom, but she is seeing white 
   rapper-wannabe Derron (Phillip Andrew Christopher). At a party, Adam 
   gets up enough nerve to ask Cindy to the prom, but when one of 
   Derron's homies informs him of what Adam is doing, he challenges Adam 
   to a fight and generally embarrasses Adam in front of everyone. At 
   one point Adam asks the overweight Wendy (Emily Bordignon) to the 
   prom to try and save some face, but he still walks away with his tail 
   between his legs. Later on that night, he has Wendy give him a 
   blowjob in his car and convinces her to agree that he has spent the 
   entire night with her, even though he has no intention of doing so. 
   What Adam actually does is go to Derron's house in his mask get-up, 
   knock-out Derron while he is making love to Cindy doggy-style and 
   then stabs Cindy in the vagina with his trusty switchblade (in loving 
   close-up). He then ties-up both Cindy and Derron to chairs with duct 
   tape, where he cuts-off Derron's finger, slices-off his tongue and 
   then kills Cindy, raping her dead body (thankfully, off-screen). He 
   then shoves a microphone in Derron's mouth, killing him (Adam is 
   aware that Derron has a video camera hidden inside a stuffed animal 
   so he can film his trysts with women, so the masked Adam plays up to 
   the camera before he leaves). When he is home, his mother warns him 
   not to go out because there is a serial killer on the loose. She also 
   informs him that his long-absent brother Joseph (Cory Jacob) is 
   coming over to visit, which sends Adam over the edge. His mother 
   notices the knife and wants to know why he has it. He threatens her 
   life if she doesn't quit nagging him (She really is a piece of work). 
   When Joseph shows up for dinner, an arguement between Adam and Joseph 
   ensues, where Adam tells Joseph (who is a recovering drug addict and 
   wants to live in their house for a month until he gets back on his 
   feet, which Mom agrees to, telling Joseph he can share Adam's 
   bedroom) that he didn't even come to his own father's funeral and how 
   dare he show his face around him. Their mother takes Joseph's side 
   (she was abused by her husband, after all) and Adam gets up and 
   storms out of the house. Mom tells Joseph about the knife she saw 
   Adam carrying and they go to his bedroom, where Joseph reads Adam's 
   journal and discovers that Adam is the serial killer, finding the 
   mask under his bed. When Adam gets home, Joseph and his mother 
   confront him, telling him he belongs in a mental institution. Adam 
   hits Joseph in the head with a baseball bat and then stabs him in the 
   leg, forcing him to watch as he bashes his mother's head 
   over-and-over on the floor until her brains spill out. Adam then 
   tells Joseph to eat their mother's spilled brains and when Joseph 
   refuses, Adam stabs him in the eye, killing him. <A HREF="my_pure_joy_2011b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/my pure joy poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="162" HEIGHT="250" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>He
    puts the mask on Joseph, just as the police come to the door (Mom 
   dialed 911 before Adam was able to kill her), making it look like 
   Joseph was the serial killer. Adam gets away with it all, collecting 
   his mother's life insurance, but it turns out that both Chris and 
   Steve were nothing but imaginary friends that Adam concocted in his 
   mind, as the final shot shows us.&nbsp; One man force James Cullen

    PURE JOY</A></B> just doesn't make his case that watching horror 
   films as a child can turn you into a serial killer. Making the excuse 
   that his mother was abused by his father doesn't wash, because Adam 
   himself wasn't physically abused (Sure, he was emotionally abused by 
   his father's rantings, but c'mon). If everyone in that situation 
   turned out like Adam, horror films would not be as popular as they 
   are (and would probably be banned in this politically correct 
   climate). Besides that huge gaffe, the film also has that washed-out 
   look that cheap digital cameras display, so nothing really pops and 
   the colors are muted (It was reportedly shot on a $10,000 budget and 
   it looks it). There are a few good gore scenes (but the &quot;knife 
   in the eye&quot; gag is terrible, because you can plainly see that 
   the blade of switchblade is not deployed) and Alexei Ryan is good as 
   Adam, but gore and good acting don't necessarily translate into a 
   good film. The message of this film really bothered me, because it 
   seems to me that director Bressack is telling his audience that 
   excessively watching horror films, especially gory horror films, will 
   turn you into a psychopathic killer. As we all know, that is not true 
   and that is where this film fails miserably. In my opinion, it's not 
   worth the cheap digital tape it was made on. Also starring Lisa 
   Frantz as Adam's mother, Jon Bloch, Kevin Flood, Laura Meadows, 
   Nathan Blaiwes, Bailey Gaddis, Doug Waugh and Bryan Calvert. Director 
   Bressack can be heard as the 911 operator during the finale of the

   brain through my right ear. Why do I keep doing this to myself? A 
   plane carrying strange plant life from the Antarctic (as part of 
   &quot;Operation Deep Freeze&quot;, which consists of stock shots of 
   penguins, dog sleds and glaciers) crash-lands on a military base on 
   tropical Gow Island when the cargo on the plane gets loose and begins 
   attacking the passengers and crew. Acting Base Commander Lt. Charles 
   Brown (Anthony Eisley; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DeepSpace">DEEP SPACE</A></B> 
   - 1988) and Ensign Rutherford Chandler (Bobby Van; <B><A HREF="doomsday_machine_1972.htm">DOOMSDAY
    MACHINE</A></B> - 1972) board the destroyed plane and the only 
   person they find is the pilot, who is in a state of extreme shock. 
   Base nurse Nora Hall (Mamie Van Doren<A HREF="navy_vs_the_night_monsters_1966.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/navy vs the night monsters vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="201" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>;

   and the base doctor (Phillip Terry; <B><A HREF="leech_woman_1960.htm">THE
    LEECH WOMAN</A></B> - 1960) tend to the speechless pilot, whiles 
   Charles and Chandler try to figure out what happened to the rest of 
   the plane's crew. Did they jump out of the plane (during the fracas 
   on-board the plane in the beginning of the film, we watch as a very 
   frightened cook opens the plane's door and jumps without a parachute, 
   taking the co-pilot with him) or has something more nefarious 
   happened to them? We find out that the plane was transporting some 
   unknown plant life that was found in an extremely warm section of the 
   Antarctic and now it has gotten loose on Gow Island. And, surprise!, 
   these miniature tree-like plants are capable of walking on their 
   roots, secrete an acid that dissolves human flesh and like the taste 
   of people! In between Peyton Place-like theatrics (where civilian 
   meteorologist Bob Spaulding [Edward Faulkner; <B><A HREF="florida_connection_1974.htm">THE
    FLORIDA CONNECTION</A></B> - 1974] has the hots for Nora, but she 
   only has eyes for Charles), biologist Dr. Arthur Beecham (Walter 
   Sande) and his assistant Marie (Pamela Mason; <B><A HREF="door_to_door_maniac_1961.htm">DOOR-TO-DOOR
    MANIAC</A></B> - 1961) try to figure out what makes these plants 
   tick and how to combat their acid strikes. After devouring all the 
   penguins in the warehouse, the killer plants turn their attention to 
   the base personnel, beginning with a guard at the downed plane and 
   Marie, who both become plant food. Chandler is the next victim when 
   he searches for his little doggie in the jungle and is grabbed by one 
   of the carnivorous (or rather, omnivorous, as Dr. Beecham corrects 
   Charles) plants. It turns out that these plants are also intelligent, 
   as they destroy the base generator, knocking out the electricity. The 
   plants are also hatching babies (!) and soon the base is overrun with 
   full-grown and baby killer plants, all capable of secreting the acid. 
   How to resolve this problem? I love the smell of napalm in the 
   morning!&nbsp; I like to think of <B><A HREF="navy_vs_the_night_monsters_1965b.htm">THE
    NAVY VS. THE NIGHT MONSTERS</A></B> as a $1.99 version of <B><A HREF="day_of_the_triffids_1962.htm">DAY
    OF THE TRIFFIDS</A></B> (1962) with more than a touch of TV soap 
   opera. It should come as no surprise then to learn that 
   director/screenwriter Michael A. Hoey had a long career directing 
   episodes of American TV series (he was also editor of the 1977 TV 
   movie <B><A HREF="possessed_1977.htm">THE POSSESSED</A></B>). <B>NAVY</B> 
   seems to be shot on a series of sets (it's the sand in the jungle 
   that gives it away) with some on-location photography and stock 
   footage interspread throughout. The plants themselves are a 
   ridiculous concoction (they look like miniature palm trees with 
   tentacles), but there are some surprising graphic bits of gore, 
   including an acid-scarred corpse, some close-up shots of acid burns 
   and CPO Fred Twining (Billy Gray; <B><A HREF="werewolves_on_wheels_1971.htm">WEREWOLVES
    ON WHEELS</A></B> - 1971) having his arm ripped-off by a plant. The 
   most unintentional funny sequences to me are when the shell-shocked 
   pilot keeps escaping from his hospital bed and attacking the 
   personnel (he is eventually devoured by a plant), when all the base 
   doctor would have to do is restrain him to the bed and solve the 
   problem once and for all (and save his life, too). It's lapses in 
   logic such as this that makes this film such a hoot to watch (and 
   Bobby Van calls Anthony Eisley &quot;Charlie Brown&quot; so many 
   times, you half-expect Eisley to let out a &quot;Good grief!&quot; 
   every now and then), but only if you are in the right frame of mind.

   (1987) - </B>After reading so many positive reviews the past several 
   years in genre publications, I finally broke down and bought a copy 
   of this German-language, English-subtitled cult film. As I thought, I 
   was not impressed. This grimy-looking, ultra-low budget horror film 
   about a man (Daktari Lorenz) and a woman (Beatrice M) who like to 
   have sex with rotting corpses is not recommended for anyone with an 
   ounce of good taste left in their bodies. It showcases the actual 
   killing and skinning of a rabbit (in graphic close-up), the slaughter 
   of a cat (put in a plastic bag and repeatedly smashed against a wall) 
   and other ghastly perversities, all shown in loving detail. The faked 
   gore effects are quite well done but a film needs more than good 
   effects to get a positive review from me. This film contains nothing 
   else. Even at 73 minutes, this boring piece of celluloid moves at a 
   snail's pace. I just don't get it's popularity. Directed by Jorg 
   Buttgereit, who later made a sequel and other gore films that defy 
   explanation. Alfred Sole's 1972 sex film titled <B><A HREF="deep_sleep_1972.htm">DEEP
    SLEEP</A> </B>and Straw Weisman's <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Deadmate">DEADMATE</A></B>

   way and director Jacques LaCerte's <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#LoveMeDeadly1972">LOVE
    ME DEADLY</A></B> (1972) handles the subject much more seriously 
   than this film does. To see a German horror film made the right way,

    MANIACS</A><A NAME="NeonManiacs1985"></A> (1985) -</B> This mid-80's 
   horror film is a good example of style over substance. That is to 
   say, that while the film is great to look at, the story makes very 
   little sense (actually, no sense at all). It could because the film 
   had financial production problems, forcing the film to close down for 
   three months and some of the actors playing the creatures were no 
   longer available, which is why two (or even three) people are 
   credited with playing certain creatures. Or it could be the 
   screenplay (by Mark Patrick Carducci; <B><A HREF="pumpkinhead_1988.htm">PUMPKINHEAD</A></B> 
   - 1988; who passed away at age 42 in 1997) is so utterly bizarre, you 
   could get a brain aneurysm if you think about it too hard. The film 
   opens with a fisherman casting his line under San Francisco's Golden 
   Gate Bridge. He has no luck, so he begins to leave, when he notices a 
   steer skull that is holding a tarot-sized deck of cards, each one of 
   them portraying a different creature (one of them reminded me of the 
   &quot;Chattering Cenobite&quot; in <B><A HREF="hellraiser_1987.htm">HELLRAISER</A></B>,
    which was made two years later). Suddenly, a door open at the 
   foundation of the bridge <A HREF="neon_maniacs_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/neon maniacs vhs front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="165" HEIGHT="288" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>and
    the fisherman is killed with an ax (offscreen), just like the one a 
   creature is holding in one of the cards. The film then switches to a 
   bunch of teens in a van, where they are singing &quot;Happy 
   Birthday&quot; to Natalie (Leilani Savelle; <B><A HREF="deliberate_stranger_1986.htm">THE
    DELIBERATE STRANGER</A></B> - 1986). Ray (James Atcheson) stops the 
   van so they can pick up some beer and party at a park near the 
   bridge. While the are waiting for Ray, Steve (Allan Hayes; <B><A HREF="friday_the_13th_part_4_the_final_chapter_1984.htm">FRIDAY
    THE 13TH: THE FINAL CHAPTER</A></B> - 1984) is walking his dog 
   (which he has named &quot;Dog&quot;, because &quot;Cat&quot; would be 
   inappropriate!), when it breaks free and runs directly to Natalie. 
   It's plain to see that there is some chemistry between Steve and 
   Natalie, but Ray comes out of the liquor store, calls Steve 
   &quot;Baloney Boy&quot; (he works at his father's grocery store), 
   hops in the van and drives off. We are then introduced to younger 
   teen Paula (Donna Locke; her only film, which is too bad because she 
   is good here), a horror film fanatic who has her bedroom decorated 
   with all types of horror film memorabilia. She is also a budding 
   filmmaker who plans on beginning to shoot her first horror film the 
   following morning. We are then transported to the park, where Natalie 
   and her friends (and a few other people) are partying. Wally (Jeff 
   Tyler) and girlfriend Sue (Katherine Heard) go to a park bench for a 
   little nookie (bare breasts alert!), when we see the feet of several 
   creatures approaching the park carrying such weapons as a sword, 
   noose, crossbow, etc. Suddenly, there is a god-awful screech coming 
   from the direction of the bridge that everyone hears, but basically 
   ignore. We finally see the faces behind the feet and weapons and the <B><A HREF="neon_maniacs_1985b.htm">NEON
    MANIACS</A></B> are not pretty (Makeup effects supplied by Allan A. 
   Apone &amp; Douglas J. White, who worked together often on such films

   [1982]). &quot;Decapitator&quot; cuts off Wally's head while he is 
   lying on the ground. &quot;Samurai&quot; slices off a girl's head 
   while she is giving her boyfriend a blowjob and then cuts the 
   boyfriend in half. &quot;Scavenger&quot; impales Sue's face with a 
   giant hook and drags her away. &quot;Punk Biker&quot; rips a 
   motorcycle rider's foot off. &quot;Hangman&quot; lynches Ray with a 
   noose, while &quot;Slasher&quot; cuts his body while he is hanging 
   from a tree. &quot;Archer&quot; shoots a fleeing girl in the back 
   with a crossbow. The creatures, which in this instance also include 
   &quot;Mohawk&quot;, &quot;Ape&quot; and &quot;Axe&quot; (all the 
   creatures names are self-explanatory), all converge on Natalie and 
   the van (she is the only one left alive). Since she doesn't have the 
   keys, all she can do is lock all the doors and hope for the best. The 
   creatures begin destroying the van and just when they are about to 
   overturn it, we hear a clap of thunder and see a bolt of lightning, 
   which scares the creatures away. Why? Since no bodies are found, the 
   police, which includes Detectives Devin (Victor Elliot Brandt; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Wacko">WACKO</A></B> 
   - 1981) and Wylie (David Muir; he was <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DrHackenstein1987">DR.
    HACKENSTEIN</A></B> - 1987), find Natalie's explanation of events 
   hard to swallow, so they begin to tail her, just in case the parents 
   of the six missing teens report that their kids have not come home. 
   The detectives believe Natalie knows more than what she is saying 
   (Natalie's absentee rich parents are off vacationing out of the 
   country and are unreachable). Natalie decides to float on a tube in 
   her pool late that night, unaware that &quot;Ape&quot; is waiting for 
   her at the edge of the pool. She falls asleep and has a strange 
   nightmare where it is raining blood, but she wakes up when it 
   actually begins to rain and &quot;Ape&quot; is no longer there (Clue 
   alert!). The police search the park the following morning, but all 
   they find are puddles of green goo. Paula's friend Gary (Chuck 
   Hemingway), the son of one of the cops who searched the park, tells 
   her the story about what happened to Natalie last night and Paula 
   wants to know more because the six teens are now officially missing 
   (To Paula, this has the makings of a good horror film, as we watch 
   her filming an awful amateur horror film in a graveyard with her 
   video camera). Meanwhile, Natalie is suspended from high school for 
   an extended period of time by the Principal because he believes that 
   her being in school will be disruptive to the rest of the students, 
   who blame her for their friends' disappearances (She also gets calls 
   from some of the missing teens' parents, who want to know the truth 
   about where their kids are). When Natalie refuses to talk to the 
   inquisitive Paula, the amateur sleuth does some investigating of her 
   own and follows a trail of green slime to the locked door at the base 
   of the bridge. (She is chased away by the police, one who she catches 
   riding her pink bike!). Steven delivers groceries to Natalie's house 
   and they end up making a date to go to the movies (Natalie makes it 
   clear to Steve that it will not be a horror film!). While her mother 
   is on a date that night, Paula heads to the bridge with her video 
   camera and films the creatures coming out of the door. She notices 
   that when one of the creatures trips and his hand falls into a water 
   puddle, it dissolves (Don't think too hard about this, because just 
   the thought of creatures that are adverse to water living in a bridge 
   is just too mind-boggling to keep you sane! Either these creatures 
   were born without rational thought or the scrennwriter just said, 
   &quot;What the fuck. No one will notice this.&quot; I tend to lean 
   towards the latter.). It starts to rain out again, so the creatures 
   retreat back to the door at the base of the bridge. After that, Steve 
   and Natalie have a close call with the creatures on a subway train 
   and then on a bus (Where &quot;Mohawk&quot; loses and arm, but when 
   we see him later, it is reattached and working fine!) and they also 
   discover that water is the creatures' kryptonite. They join forces 
   with Paula to bring these creatures down (one of them tries to kill 
   Paula in her bedroom, but she is prepared and turns the tables on it, 
   first throwing a bucket of water on it and then killing it in the 
   shower). The finale (well, close to the finale) takes place at a 
   Battle Of The Bands competition (where Steven is a lead singer in one 
   of the bands and sings a sappy love song) at the high school's 
   gymnasium, where Natalie, Steve and Paula arm everyone with water 
   pistols, telling them that the bands are going to be so hot, they 
   will need to cool themselves off with them (talk about inflated egos 
   and false pretenses!). The creatures (including some we have never 
   seen before, including &quot;Soldier&quot; and &quot;Juice&quot; [who 
   electrocutes everyone he touches]) attack the gymnasium, where we see 
   human limbs (and a juicy shot of a girl getting shot in the back of 
   her head with a crossbow bolt, the tip protruding out of her mouth) 
   and creature parts flying through the air (one creature has his head 
   blown off with a fire hose). Nearly everyone dies, besides Steve,<A HREF="neon_maniacs_1986_blu-ray.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/neon maniacs blu-ray front small8.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="260" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Natalie and Paula (they should have told the rest of the students the 
   truth instead of seeing them killed like lambs for the slaughter). In 
   one of the most ridiculous scenes in 80's horror film history, the 
   police and fire department head to the door in the Golden Gate Bridge 
   armed with water pistols and fire hoses, but when they open the door, 
   they find nothing. When everyone else leaves, Detective Devlin takes 
   one final look behind the door and pays with his life. The Neon 
   Maniacs still live.&nbsp; Since we are given absolutely no backstory 
   behind why the Neon Maniacs even exist, it's hard to be really scared 
   of them. Sure, they are nothing but killing machines, but where did 
   they come from? Outer Space? Hell? Did someone fart them out? 
   Director Joseph Mangine (he passed away in 2006 at age 73), who is 
   better known for being a Cinematographer on such genre films as <B><A HREF="i_drink_your_blood_1971_dvd2.htm">I

   (1982), and many others (he photographed this film with Oliver Wood), 
   gives this film a colorful sheen and keeps the pacing and beyond 
   R-Rated gore (which makes me wonder if the MPAA was sleeping at the 
   wheel when it passed this film with an R-Rating) coming fast and 
   furious, but the story is so convoluted and unbelievable, you'll find 
   yourself laughing instead of being scared. There are also some really 
   &quot;What The Fuck?!?&quot; scenes, such as when Steve and Natalie, 
   who are being chased by the creatures in the high school, stop long 
   enough to make out. I guess getting a piece of tail is more important 
   than saving your life. It's those kinds of situations that permeate 
   the entire film and make it impossible to turn your brain off and 
   just enjoy the film. It's one of those films that could have only 
   come from the 80's and if you like horror films that make you laugh 
   unintentionally (the makeup effects are excellent, though), you're 
   gonna love this one. Be on the lookout for the film debut of actor 
   Andrew Divoff (<B><A HREF="wishmaster_1997.htm">WISHMASTER</A></B> - 
   1997). He portrays one of the creatures called &quot;Doc&quot; and he 
   can be seen killing the high school security guard who is listening 
   to a baseball game on the radio just before all the creatures attack 
   the gymnasium. You can't see his face because it is covered by a 
   surgical mask, but this is his first film credit. Stuntman supreme 
   Solly Marx (here billed as &quot;Solly Mark&quot;), who portrayed the 
   killer &quot;Howard Johns&quot; in the underrated 3-D slasher film <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Silent Madness">SILENT
    MADNESS</A></B> (1984), was one of the people to portray both 
   &quot;Punk Biker&quot; and &quot;Samurai&quot; due to a three month 
   financial production delay, where the original people portraying the 
   creatures were no longer available when filming resumed. That is why 
   during the closing credits you will see two or three people listed as 
   playing the same role. Originally available on VHS from <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Lightning Video">Lightning
    Video</A> and then on <A HREF="neon_maniacs_dvd_1985.htm">DVD</A>

   &quot;clean-up&quot; the grain. This is as close to a theatrical

   makeup artist on most of his films) and the original theatrical

   warning: If the sight of cockroaches (lots of 'em) makes you queasy, 
   it's best if you avoid this film. It's almost tourist season and the 
   island town of Northport is having a deadly insect problem, thanks to 
   some unscrupulous experiments being performed there by biotech firm 
   Intech, under the watchful eye of local bigshot, Mayor Elias Johnson 
   (Robert Lansing). Sheriff Richard<A HREF="nest_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/nest 1987 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Tarbell (Franc Luz; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#GhostTown1988">GHOST TOWN</A></B> 
   - 1988) is starting to get some strange reports, like a dog being 
   slaughtered and stripped of it's flesh and all the books in the local 
   library having the glue in their bindings eaten away in one night. It 
   becomes apparent that a mutant strain of cockroaches are to blame, 
   but why are they loose on this island? Complicating matters for 
   Richard is the sudden arrival of Mayor Johnson's daughter, Elizabeth 
   (Lisa Langlois; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Deadly Eyes">DEADLY EYES</A></B> 
   - 1982), who use to be engaged to Richard before she left the island 
   unannounced a couple of years earlier after the death of her mother. 
   Intech sends scientist Dr. Morgan Hubbard (Terri Treas; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#TerrorWithin">THE
    TERROR WITHIN</A></B> - 1989) to do an autopsy on the dead dog, but 
   Richard smells a rat after watching Mayor Johnson and Dr. Hubbard 
   working so closely together, like they have handled this same type of 
   situation previously. He's right, of course, as Intech is fully aware 
   of the cockroach problem because they are responsible for the 
   infestation. With the arrival of his daughter on the island and her 
   life threatened by the onslaught of roaches, Mayor Johnson has a 
   sudden change of heart and wants to evacuate everyone off the island, 
   but Dr. Hubbard talks him out of it, telling him she can rid the 
   island of the cockroaches in twenty-four hours using a new poison. He 
   shouldn't have listened to her. It's not long before the flesh-hungry 
   roaches begin devouring the occupants of the island, beginning with 
   Shakey Jake (Jack Collins), the father of Richard's new girlfriend, 
   Lillian (Nancy Morgan), who runs the local diner. Elizabeth stupidly 
   treks out alone on a nostalgic trip through the island's cave system, 
   but she is nearly eaten alive by a swarm of cockroaches after 
   discovering some huge roach cocoons and timebombs (with the Intech 
   logo on them!) in the caves. Richard resigns his post as sheriff when 
   Mayor Johnson orders him to stay away from the caves and it's not 
   long before the entire island is overrun with killer cockroaches. As 
   we will soon find out, these are no ordinary cockroaches. They 
   assimilate everything they eat and their goal is to mate with the 
   human species, producing the first human/roach hybrid. Imagine how 
   difficult it will be to exterminate this new species. They're going 
   to need one big-assed can of Raid (but I guess those timebombs in the 
   caves will do in a pinch)!&nbsp; This creepy and effective low-<A HREF="nest_1987b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/nest dutch vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="121" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>budget
    horror film from Roger Corman's Concorde Pictures (it's probably 
   their best 80's horror flick) is full of goosebump-inducing scenes of 
   cockroaches attacking, crawling and swarming over humans. For anyone 
   who has ever had a roach problem, this film should hit right where it 
   hurts. While I never had to deal with an infestation as bad as in 
   this film, I once had a problem with those cagey buggers in my 
   apartment after pulling some boxes out of a storage locker and 
   bringing them home, accidentally setting loose about thirty 
   cockroaches. These fuckers were so big, they scared the shit out of 
   my cats and were nearly impossible to kill. To prove my point, I 
   caught one and put it in an empty mayonnaise jar. The damned thing 
   lived for over two months with no food, water or air. I finally had 
   to call an exterminator to get rid of the pests before they 
   reproduced and overran my apartment. <B><A HREF="nest_1987b.htm">THE NEST</A></B> 
   plays on these fears and does it with a good amount of atmosphere, 
   not to mention some pretty good gore set-pieces, including Robert 
   Lansing's (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Scalpel">SCALPEL</A></B> - 
   1976; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#EmpireOfTheAnts77">EMPIRE OF 
   THE ANTS</A></B> - 1977) transformation into an uber-roach. My 
   favorite scene has nothing to do with gore, though. It's when Richard 
   finds Lillian frozen to death in her diner's freezer. Her only escape 
   from the onslaught of roaches was to hide in her freezer, yet she 
   still paid for it with her life. If watching someone unwittingly 
   drinking a cup of coffee with a roach in it or chewing into a juicy 
   steak covered with the little (and not-so-little) insects makes you 
   squeamish, I would advise that you stay away from this film. But, if 
   you like gory horror flicks and are not bothered by the sight of 
   creepy crawlers creeping and crawling over a cast of brave actors, 
   this film should be a treat. Directed efficiently by Terence Winkless (<B><A HREF="bloodfist_1989_bloodfist_2_1990.htm">BLOODFIST</A></B>

   personality Diane Sullivan (Roz Kelly), who uses the on-air moniker 
   &quot;Blaze&quot;, is hosting a live televised punk rock New Year's 
   Eve music countdown in L.A., when she gets a call from someone named 
   &quot;Evil&quot; (he uses a voice-disguising gadget) who tells her 
   that he is going to kill someone at the strike of midnight on each of 
   the U.S. time zones. Blaze asks Lt. Clayton (Chris Wallace) to 
   protect her and he sets up a phone tap. Meanwhile, someone has killed 
   Blaze's assistant before the show and her son Derek (Grant Cramer) is 
   having bad headaches. As the clock strikes midnight in New York 
   (EST), Evil (disguised as an orderly) kills a nurse at the Crawford 
   Sanitarium and records the murder on a cassette tape. He then calls 
   Blaze, plays the tape and tells her he will kill again in an hour, 
   when the clock strikes twelve in Chicago (CST). Evil slaps on a fake 
   moustache and a polyester suit and goes to a disco. He picks up <A HREF="new_years_evil_1980b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/new year's evil vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="125" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>two
    women and tells them that they are going to a &quot;party at Erik 
   Estrada's pad&quot;. He stops at a liquor store, sends one girl 
   inside for champagne and suffocates the other girl with a plastic bag 
   over her head and kills the other girl in a dumpster as the clock 
   hits midnight in Chicago. He records both murders and calls Blaze, 
   telling her he will be killing again when the clock strikes twelve in 
   Aspen, Colorado (MST). Dressed as a priest, Evil has a close call 
   with a pack of bikers at a drive-in (where a trailer for Cannon 
   Film's <B><A HREF="blood_feast_blood_bath_cannon_ad_mat.htm">BLOOD 
   FEAST/BLOOD BATH</A></B> double feature is playing) and steals a car 
   with a half-naked teenage girl in the back. She manages to get away 
   and he chases her into a stadium, but a cop intervenes before he is 
   able to kill her. Back at the studio, Derek is walking around in the 
   shadows with a red stocking over his face, looking like some 
   perverted rapist. Evil knocks out a cop, steals his uniform and 
   enters the heavily-guarded studio. It's at this time we find out that 
   Evil is actually Blaze's husband Richard (Kip Niven) and what his 
   motivations for the killings were. He was an ex-patient at the 
   Crawford Sanitarium and he's not too happy about the way she's 
   treating their son (truth be told, she is a pretty shitty mother). I 
   know it makes no sense, but that's the best explanation you're gonna 
   get. In the finale, as Richard sets up his wife to take a big fall 
   (he takes one instead), we learn that old saying, &quot;Like Father, 
   Like Son&quot; couldn't be truer.&nbsp; Directed without much verve 
   by Emmett Alston (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Demonwarp">DEMONWARP</A></B> 
   - 1988), this film could pass for a TV movie if it weren't for the 
   infrequent gore and nudity. It's also kind of hard to root for Blaze 
   when Roz Kelly plays her as such an insufferable, uncaring 
   manipulative bitch. At the end of the film, you kind of hope Richard 
   does her in. When he puts a chain around her neck and handcuffs her 
   to the undercarriage of an elevator and sends her for a ride up and 
   down the shaft, you'll hope she ends up crushed when she reaches the 
   basement. Unfortunately, it doesn't happen, but there's still hope as 
   the film fades to black (seems we all forgot that Hawaii has a 
   separate time zone, too). Not very bloody or exciting, scripter 
   Leonard Neubauer does throw in a few funny lines, such as when one of 
   the disco chicks says to the other as she is spouting the benefits of 
   transcendental meditation to Richard while they are in the car: 
   'Whatever comes into your head comes right out your mouth!&quot; It's 
   hard to believe that, for a four hour live show, only two bands would 
   play (&quot;Shadow&quot; and &quot;Made In Japan&quot;) and their 
   playlist would consist of five songs total (and not very good songs 
   at that). Even if it were a free show, I would demand something back. <B><A HREF="new_years_evil_1980.htm">NEW

    The film opens with an old man playing fetch with his dog along the 
   banks of the East River under the Brooklyn Bridge. The man throws a 
   piece of wood into some brush and when his dog returns, she has a 
   decomposing woman's hand in her mouth. Police Lt. Fred Williams (Jack

   is in charge of the case and he questions Mrs. Weissburger (Babette

    BABY</A></B> - 1982) sitting in her red VW Beetle on the Staten 
   Island Ferry. The quacking killer pulls out a switchblade and cuts 
   Rosie from her nether region to her neck (The coroner says, &quot;He 
   shoved it up her joy trail and kept on cutting. Good, efficient 
   butchery.&quot;) Lt. Williams tells the Chief Of Police (Fulci, who 
   always gives himself a cameo role in his films; in this one with his 
   trademark pipe) that he will solve this case with little or no 
   publicity, which pleases the Chief. He will have a hard time carrying 
   out this promise, as the killer (who talks like a bastardized version 
   of Donald Duck!) taunts Lt. Williams constantly over the phone. Lt. 
   Williams then goes to psychologist Dr. Paul Davis (Paolo Malco; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#BronxWarriors2">BRONX
    WARRIORS 2</A></B> - 1983) to get a profile on what type of person 
   would do such a heinous thing, but when Lt. Williams will not let him 
   read the police files (?), he says &quot;OK, we'll just have to wait 
   until the next woman is sliced to death!&quot; (Dr. Davis seems more

   goes to her dressing room, where the quacking Ripper stabs her in the 
   vagina with a broken bottle, twisting it so she dies a gruesome, 
   bloody death. The Ripper then calls Lt. Williams, who is sleeping 
   with a young woman named Kitty (Daniela Doria; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackCat1981">THE
    BLACK CAT</A></B> - 1981; He asks Kitty to get him a cup of coffee 
   and she replies, &quot;Sweetheart, I'm a prostitute, not your

   leg with the switchblade, but she gets away and survives. Fay gives 
   Lt. Williams their first big clue: The killer is missing two fingers 
   on his right hand. (Fay also has a nightmare where her fiance, Peter

    We then see Jane playing sex games with Mickey Scellenda (Howard 
   Ross; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#WerewolfWoman1976">WEREWOLF WOMAN</A></B> 
   - 1976) back at his place. Jane is tied naked to a bed and Mickey 
   falls asleep next to her. She hears a radio DJ say, &quot;This is for 
   the dude that is missing two fingers on his right hand. Leave the 
   ladies alone.&quot; (So much for no publicity!). She looks at 
   Mickey's right hand and, sure enough, it is missing two fingers. She 
   manages to untie herself and tries to escape, but the Ripper cuts her 
   from stem to stern, finishing her off by stabbing her in the neck. 
   Lt. Williams and Dr. Davis now have a name to go with the Ripper, but 
   Dr. Davis is not so sure that Mickey is the killer. He believes that 
   Fay is holding back some vital information. Fay should have been more 
   upfront with them (Even though Lt. William believes Mickey is the 
   Ripper), as someone is stalking her. It turns out the stalker is 
   Mickey, but he wants to know why Fay fingered him (pardon the pun) as 
   the Ripper. Mickey only makes himself look more guilty, as Peter 
   intervenes and chases Mickey away.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Ripper then calls Lt. Williams (He says in his duck voice, 
   &quot;I'm going to dedicate a killing to you. I'm going to sacrifice 
   a woman just for you!&quot;), but the police are tracing the phone 
   call. The call is coming from a phone booth near the docks and when 
   Lt. Williams gets there, he discovers that the Ripper was expecting 
   him, as the receiver is lying next to a walkie talkie. The Ripper 
   tells Lt. Williams that he has Kitty, as we watch him slice Kitty 
   with a razor blade (We see the razor cut one of Kitty's nipples in 
   half and then slice her left eye in half, in the film's most 
   notorious scenes). Lt. Williams rushes to Kitty's house too late, 
   where he finds her body a bloody mess. Four days later, Mickey is 
   found dead with a plastic bag over his head. The coroner says his 
   body has been dead for eight days and Lt. Williams finally realizes 
   that he couldn't possibly be the Ripper.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    But just who is the Ripper? During the finale, we are led to believe 
   that it is Fay, but it is actually Peter. Peter's deathly ill young 
   daughter Susy from a previous marriage is the cause for all of his 
   rage. As she is dying in a hospital bed, he blames his ex-wife for 
   their daughter's condition. He killed women while talking like a duck 
   (we find out he talked that way to his daughter to cheer her up) as a 
   way to vent is anger towards his ex-wife. As Peter is about to kill 
   Fay, Lt. Williams shows up and shoots Peter in the face, killing him 
   (another very graphic scene). The film ends with Peter's sickly 
   daughter picking up the phone and saying, &quot;Daddy, don't leave me!&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While exposing the killer is a cheat on the audience (the sick 
   daughter was never mentioned until the end!), the question still 
   remains: Is this film misogynistic? I can see where some people think 
   it is, but these people probably didn't know Lucio Fulci's body of 
   work. If they did, they would probably be more forgiving, but there 
   is no doubt in my mind that <B><A HREF="new_york_ripper_1982b.htm">THE
    NEW YORK RIPPER</A></B> is Fulci' most visceral, brutal film with a 
   real <A HREF="new_york_ripper_1982b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/new york ripper poster10a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="199" HEIGHT="304" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>nasty
    streak to it. I don't fault people for thinking that this film 
   treats women like dirt because, when viewed with no prior knowledge 
   of Fulci's other works, it does treat women unfairly. They are 
   sex-starved hookers, sex show workers without a trace of redeeming 
   value, just like Fulci wants them. The men do not fare much better in 
   this film. They sleep with hookers, have sexual hangups or just don't 
   give a damn, also the way Fulci likes them. My only problem with this 
   film is the sudden knee-jerk way it exposes the killer. The entire 
   film doesn't even hint at Peter's motivations until the last five 
   minutes. But there are good points here, too. The quacking duck voice 
   may seem ridiculous in the beginning, but by the end, it is 
   completely terrifying. The makeup effects, all practical (by Germano 
   Natali; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Starcrash">STARCRASH</A></B> 
   - 1979), are hard to watch, even today. There is nothing left to the imagination.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The fantastic-looking uncut DVD from Blue Underground (I have no 
   clue as why I didn't buy their Blu-Ray since it is a seminal film in 
   Fulci's canon) contains some great extras, including an informative 
   interview with Zora Kerova and my favorite &quot;NYC Locations Then 
   And Now&quot;. which compares the locations used in this film in 1981 
   to how they look in 2009 (when this disc was released). It was 
   instant nostalgia for me since I walked those locations in the 
   early-'80s when I was a chemist who visited NY correctional and 
   psychiatric institutes. (<B>Little-Known Useless Trivia:</B> I was 
   once mugged at one of those locations and, when I didn't get my 
   wallet fast enough, the mugger tried to stab me, but I grabbed the 
   blade with my left hand. I had to get over 20 stitches and still have 
   the scars to prove it. The mugger was never caught.) This was also 
   one of Fulci's films that I didn't see theatrically (It's a long 
   story) and I often wondered how audiences reacted towards it. The 
   screenplay, by Fulci, Gianfranco Clerici (<B><A HREF="cannibal_holocaust_1980.htm">CANNIBAL

   Someone is killing teenagers by cutting their heads off with a 
   serrated tree saw, which is making the town's new sheriff, Carl 
   (Kerry Knight), job hard on him, especially since all the heads are 
   missing. Everyone in town begins to blame the hulking and deformed 
   Charlie Puckett (Chuck Whiting), a local man who runs Charlie's Tree 
   Service and is so ugly, he wears a burlap bag and a huge pair of 
   goggles on his head. Walt (Joe Fishback), the town's coroner, begins 
   to worry because he has two girls the same<A HREF="night_brings_charlie_1990.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/night brings charlie vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="115" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   age as the ones getting murdered: Daughter Tanya (Monica Simmons) and 
   step-daughter Jenny (Aimee Tenalia). Since Walt just recently lost 
   his wife (and Jenny a mother), he keeps very close tabs on Jenny. 
   Some think too close. Carl begins getting phone calls at the police 
   station from the killer, taunting him. As more kids get killed and 
   their headless bodies found, the District Attorney and the press put 
   pressure on Carl to either find the killer or resign. As Carl 
   investigates, it becomes apparent that the killer is trying to make 
   it look like Charlie is the culprit. Carl is forced to arrest Charlie 
   after evidence is found in his shack. Since Walt knows Charlie, Carl 
   asks him to do the interview. A short time later, Walt comes walking 
   out of the interrogation room with a full written admission of guilt, 
   but Carl is suspicious (Charlie can't speak and the written 
   confession is in Walt's handwriting). Carl sets up a trap that night 
   and the real killer is unmasked. The killer is Walt (he has killed 
   women while serving in Vietnam, but he was never convicted), but it 
   gets worse. Charlie, you see, was in Walt's Army unit and helped Walt 
   kill the women in Vietnam. The bad news is that Carl just freed him a 
   few minutes ago and he is going after Jenny. Walt knocks out Carl and 
   escapes. Can one killer stop another killer before Jenny loses her 
   life? Be prepared for the standard slasher film ending that leaves it 
   wide open for a sequel. Thankfully, that never happened.&nbsp; This ultra-low-budget
    feature, directed by Tom Logan (<B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Shakma">SHAKMA</A></B> 
   - 1990), is nothing more than a cheap knock-off of <B><A HREF="friday_the_13th_1980.htm">FRIDAY
    THE 13TH</A></B>. The gore effects are tame, just shots of spurting 
   blood, an axe in the chest and a god-awful shot of a decapitated head 
   falling off a body. Most of the gore is shown after-the-fact, so you 
   see no actual decapitations, just the after-effects. The acting is 
   also sub-par. Aimee Tenalia as Jenny is particularly stiff and 
   emotionless and wears the same sad-faced expression throughout the 
   entire film. Everyone else isn't much better as it all looks and 
   sounds like some high school production (it was actually filmed at 
   Universal Studios in Florida). This is a really minor slasher flick 
   that can be skipped by everyone but those that have to see every 
   slasher film ever made. Bruce Carson, who wrote the highly-derivative 
   script, also performs the fire stunt in the finale, the best part of 
   the film. Also starring David Carr, George Carter and Al Arasim. A

   - 1980) watching a slideshow of paintings show various portraits of

   the same time, Emily is having a nightmare where she watches her 
   mother burn alive in a house fire (it's quite shocking in its 
   depiction). Michael has a doctor (a short cameo by Edmund Purdom; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Pieces">PIECES</A></B>

   another nervous breakdown due to her witnessing <A HREF="night_child_1975b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/night child italy poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="195" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>her
    mother's death. Michael is worried because he has to take a trip to 
   Italy shortly to film his new documentary titled &quot;Diabolical 
   Art&quot; (about demons portrayed in medieval paintings and frescos), 
   but the doctor tells him he should take Emily along, as the change of 
   scenery, coupled with her staying close to her father, will be good 
   for her psych&eacute;. Michael agrees and says he will take Emily, 
   along with her nanny Jill (Evelyn Stewart; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Psychic1977">THE
    PSYCHIC</A></B> - 1977), with him to Italy. Before they go, Michael 
   stops at BBC headquarters, where he wonders why Italian Contessa 
   Cappelli (Lila Kedrova; <B><A HREF="blood_tide_1982.htm">BLOOD TIDE</A></B> 
   - 1982) sent him a single slide of a painting depicting Satan in the 
   background watching a woman on fire falling down from the sky while a 
   little female child watches from below (William is mesmerized by it. 
   I wonder why?). He hopes to find out why from the Contessa herself 
   and the documentary's Production Manager Joanna Morgan (Joanna 
   Cassidy; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Glove">THE GLOVE</A></B> - 
   1979; I had a major crush on her when I was a teenager and she still 
   looks good today), neither of whom he has met, when they get to 
   Italy. While Michael is at the BBC, Emily and Jill are at a nearby 
   park, where Emily is staring at a statue depicting several people 
   with pained expressions on their faces. When Jill asks Emily why she 
   finds that particular statue mesmerizing, Emily replies, &quot;Their 
   faces fascinate me.&quot; Just before they leave for Italy, Michael 
   gives Emily a large medallion which she wears as a necklace. Michael 
   tells his daughter that he purchased the medallion at a rather 
   unusual shop the last time he was in Italy and that the shop clerk 
   told him it has a &quot;strange history&quot; (Then why in the hell 
   would he give it to his daughter?). When Emily puts the medallion 
   around her neck and looks in the mirror, she has a bad past memory 
   about her mother (who we see is wearing the very same medallion) 
   leaving Emily at home for an extended period while she and Michael 
   head off to Paris on holiday. It is apparent that Emily did not care 
   much for her mother, since she was alway gallivanting off to one 
   place or another with Emily's father, while leaving her at home with 
   the nanny. Once they are in Italy, they are met at the airport by the 
   beautiful Joanna and there is some instant chemistry between her and 
   Michael, which Emily notices and doesn't approve. To stop the mutual 
   admiration between her father and Joanna, Emily feigns illness so 
   Joanna has to drive them to their villa (Joanna is staying at a 
   hotel). Later that night, after assuring Emily that the Devil doesn't 
   exist, Michael heads out on foot to the mansion of Contessa Cappelli 
   (he gets lost and asks a blind man for directions and he give them to 
   him!). The elderly Contessa seems to know more about Micheal than he 
   is comfortable with, but when Michael asks her about the slide of the 
   grotesque painting that she sent him, she says it was never meant to 
   be mailed to him and he should forget about it. Michael isnsists on 
   using the painting for the opening of his documentary, but the 
   Contessa already knows why he is so obsessed with it, it reminds him 
   of his wife's death and his daughter watching it. Michael is shocked 
   to hear her say that, but the Contessa tells him that she was born 
   with the ability to read minds and she is a well-respected Medium. 
   Michael begins shooting the documentary with his crew, using 
   paintings and frescos from churches, chapels and other religious 
   places to illustrate how Lucifer is depicted throughout the ages. 
   After doing some research for Richard, she finds the location of the 
   painting that Michael is so obsessed with and takes him there. As we 
   take a much closer look at the painting, we discover that the young 
   girl in the painting bears an uncanny resemblance to Emily, but 
   something in her hand and around her neck has been obscured with red 
   paint (Michael fails to notice any of this and films it for his 
   documentary). When Michael and Joanna look at the developed footage, 
   they discover all of it was ruined by a ghost image and it will have 
   to be reshot. When Emily sees with her own eyes that her father and 
   Joanna are becoming lovers, she begins to act strange. She begins 
   smoking and acting like her mother, which Jill connects immediately 
   (She has had romantic feelings for Michael for years, but he failed 
   to notice that, too), but Michael is too involved in his documentary 
   and budding romance to really take notice (He has a severe case of 
   tunnelvision if you ask me). Emily totally flips out and attacks 
   Jill, the same time Michael and Joanna are nearly killed by a falling 
   statue in the building that houses the grotesque painting. Michael 
   discovers that an another medallion (the exact same design as the one 
   he gave Emily) and a double-bladed sword (the sword has to be held in 
   the middle; the blades extending from both sides) were hidden inside 
   the shattered statue and finally begins to realize that his daughter 
   may be possessed by a supernatural power. The Contessa does a Tarot 
   Card reading for Michael and warns him that his life is in mortal 
   danger. She also sees death by fire and water and tells Michael that 
   the little girl depicted in the painting was named &quot;Emilia&quot;.
    She was mysteriously murdered and no one knows who was behind that 
   painting (it is unsigned). While they are playing a game of Hide and 
   Seek outside, someone pushes Jill over a cliff using a croquet mallet 
   and she falls into the raging river below (a pretty bad optical 
   effect), her limp, lifeless body then taking a trip over a waterfalls 
   (Remember, the Contessa did say there would be a death by water). It 
   is quite apparent by now that Emily is possessed by the spirit of her 
   mother, as they all head back to England to bury the body of Jill. At 
   the funeral, Jill's mother tells Michael that Jill sent her a letter 
   stating that she had a strong feeling that she would not be leaving 
   Italy alive. The Contessa goes to the grotesque painting and scrapes 
   off the red paint that is obscuring Emilia's hand and chest, to 
   discover that the medallion is around her neck and she is holding the 
   double-bladed sword. Suddenly, the Contessa get a strong feeling that 
   Michael is in danger. Michael and Emily return to Italy the next day 
   (Is this father nuts or what? No time to mourn a nanny that has taken 
   care of his daughter for years?) and he asks Joanna to stay with 
   them, which puts Emily in a snit. As Michael and Joanna are making 
   love (we do get to see Joanna's impressive naked rack) in front of a 
   fireplace, Emily listens to their conversation and she will use what 
   she hears to get rid of Joanna. While the Contessa is telling Michael 
   the true meaning of the painting and warns him to go home 
   immediately, Emily is setting fire to<A HREF="night_child_1975_blu-ray.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/night child blu-ray8 front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="261" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Joanna's bedroom, but Michael arrives in the nick of time to put it 
   out. Emily runs out of the house, with Michael not far behind, trying 
   to catch her. Emily sneaks into the old building that houses the 
   grotesque painting and confronts the ghosts that have blocked her 
   conscious mind for years. As Emily comes face-to-face with the 
   painting, we learn how her mother really died. It was Emily who set 
   the fire that killed her mother and she did it on purpose. Emity 
   wasn't having nervous breakdowns because she witness her mother die, 
   but because she was the cause of her mother's death. Emily picks up 
   the double-bladed sword and destroys the painting, running into her 
   father's arms when he calls her name. Unfortunately, Emily is still 
   holding the sword, which impales both her father and herself and they 
   both die on the cold marble floor, together forever. As the camera 
   pans up, the painting is whole again, waiting for some new 
   victims.&nbsp; Director Massimo Dallamano (<B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#SecretDorianGray70">DORIAN

   responsible for writing the screenplay to <B><A HREF="inglorious_bastards_1978.htm">THE
    INGLORIOUS BASTARDS</A></B> - 1978), but this is a slow-moving 
   affair with some atmospheric and effective scenes where you can guess 
   what is going to happen long before it actually does. There is 
   precious little violence or gore in this film, the most shocking bit 
   being the flashback showing Emily's mother's arms on fire as she 
   waves them back and forth out her burning bedroom window. Besides 
   brief shots of Joanna Cassidy's breasts (always a plus in my book), 
   there is no other nudity in the film, so the mystery must satisfy the 
   viewer in order for the film to succeed. Even for 1975, the story was 
   predictable and old hat, so this must be considered a minor entry in 
   the Italian demonic possession genre. On the plus side, the <A HREF="night_child_1975_blu-ray.htm">Blu-Ray</A>,
    from Code Red, is flawless and you can see every crack, crevasse and

   is a beautiful film to look at, especially the location work in 
   Italy, where the structures are like nowhere else in the world. I 
   just wish the story was more involving and not predictable.&nbsp;

   low-budgeter (filmed in North Carolina) about rednecks vs. an alien 
   invasion. What makes this film notable and extremely entertaining is 
   the casting of apparently real rednecks and hicks in the major roles 
   and not using professional actors. A meteor crashes into a lake 
   (after destroying a TV satellite, where a hick wife throws her pots 
   and pans on the front lawn and tells her mechanic husband that he'll

   portrayed by producer Paul Barrett), who discuss the differences 
   between meteors and UFOs (and, of course, anal probes) before their 
   boat is overturned and they are devoured, turning the lake a nice

   the woods to hunt deer (they bag their first deer when their car hits 
   one, crushing the hood and front end of the car, to which John

   drives him back to his friends. Mickey tells the group about the

   left all their ammo back at the campsite, Andy volunteers to go back 
   to retrieve it while the others wait in the car (Donnie says, &quot;I

   campsite), all four head-out on foot for a two mile trek through the 
   dark woods to the nearest home, which turns out to be Clyde Cox's

   dangling from the car's trunk, but they don't notice because of all 
   the hub-bub). They finally make it to Clyde's house and discover that 
   Clyde's wife has already been killed. With no phone at the house and

    REVENGE: THE MONSTER MOVIE</A></B> - 1989), who made this movie for 
   $59,000, had the great sense to cast real-life redneck Donnie Evans 
   in the lead role of Donnie (If he's not a real-life redneck, it's 
   quite possibly the greatest acting performance in film history). 
   Evans is a hoot-and-a-half to watch and listen to (some of his 
   witticisms are comedy gold) and I applaud Eller for casting such an 
   unusual leading man. Evans is downright affecting on an emotional 
   level, too, such as when he's the only one who survives the night, 
   buries his friends, delivers a touching eulogy, kills an alien and 
   burns it (screaming out to the other aliens hiding in the treeline, 
   &quot;Carolina barbecue at its finest!&quot;) and then discovers 
   Terry hiding in the barn (When Donnie discovers Terry's boyfriend was 
   abusive, he asks her, &quot;Did that asshole at least teach you to 
   use a shotgun?&quot;). It's a star-making performance (enough to make 
   Larry The Cable Guy cry in his squirrel stew!) and not a second of it 
   rings false, which elevates <B>NIGHT FEEDERS</B> a notch or two above 
   most DTV efforts. Overlook the bad CGI and revel in the wonder that 
   is Donnie Evans. For once, we have a horror film that has a 
   satisfying ending and still leaves the film open for a sequel (you'll

   Arrowsmiths' elderly housekeeper, Solange (Helga Lin&eacute;; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DraculaSaga1973">THE
    DRACULA SAGA</A></B> - 1973), reminds Stephen that it is time for 
   him to leave for a conference in Edinburgh, where he tells Muriel he 
   will be away from the castle for only two days. Muriel sarcastically 
   says, &quot;I'll do my best to dream about you&quot; and we soon 
   discover why. Muriel has a lover in the form of muscular David (Rik 
   Battaglia; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#DeportWomenSS1976">DEPORTED 
   WOMEN OF THE SS SPECIAL SECTION</A></B> - 1976), the castle 
   groundskeeper. Muriel plays the harmonium to alert David that the 
   coast is clear and he meets her in the bedroom. Muriel doesn't want 
   to make love there because Solange may hear them, so they get down 
   and dirty in the greenhouse, where a suspicious Stephen is hiding in 
   the shadows. He watches his wife make love to the hired help and then 
   reveals himself, knocking David out cold with his cane. Muriel and 
   David are now chained to a wall in the castle dungeon, where Stephen 
   slowly tortures them for days, whipping them and branding David with 
   a hot poker. When he denies them food and water, Muriel curses him, 
   yelling, &quot;You can kill my body, but I'll never leave you in 
   peace!&quot; to which Stephen replies, &quot;I'm not afraid of the 
   dead. Corpses were meant to rot and fertilize the earth!&quot; Muriel 
   then tells a surprised Stephen that she has revised her will, leaving 
   her fortune and the castle to her stepsister Jenny. Stephen offers to 
   free the both of them if Muriel will turn over the will to him, but 
   she refuses, laughing in his face (as only Barbara Steele can!). 
   Solange, who is working in cahoots with Stephen, tells him that he 
   will have to let Muriel live, but he says no, he will simply seduce 
   Jenny and then dispose of her. We then watch Stephen dispose of 
   Muriel and David. He slowly drips acid on Muriel's face while she 
   screams in pain and places David's unconscious body on top of Muriel 
   (David originally is kept captive in a chair with arms that fold, 
   trapping him in the chair), where he electrocutes the both of them. 
   He then cuts out their hearts (for his experiments), burns their 
   bodies and places their ashes in an urn, which he uses to fertilize a 
   rare plant that he proudly displays on a mantle (at least he is true 
   to his word!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Time passes and Stephen is now married to Jenny (Steele again) and 
   he brings her to the castle. Solange (who is now young and beautiful 
   thanks to Stephen's experiments) is upset because he never told her 
   that he was marrying Jenny (she wants him for herself), but Stephen 
   tells her not to worry, because he finds Jenny &quot;ugly and 
   repulsive&quot; (is he blind?!?) and plans on making her life a 
   living hell. One night, while Jenny and Stephen are sleeping 
   (together), Jenny is awoken by the sound of a human heartbeat and she 
   sees the ghost of David rise from a tomb and make love to her in the 
   greenhouse, where a figure of a man, with a white stocking over his 
   face, hits David over the head with his cane. Jenny wakes up in bed 
   with her hands around Stephen's neck, yelling out &quot;David! 
   David!&quot; At this point, we have to ask ourselves if this was a 
   trick perpetrated by Stephen or is Jenny's stepsister reaching out 
   from the grave?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Stephen believes his dastardly plan of driving Jenny crazy is 
   working because, the night before, Solange dosed Jenny's champagne 
   with an hallucinogen, but he discovers Solange gave her the wrong 
   vial, which was a harmless sugar placebo. Jenny, who never played the 
   harmonium before, begins playing it like a pro, even playing an 
   original composition by Muriel without even looking at the sheet 
   music. She asks Stephen where Muriel is buried and he tells her in 
   the family crypt and, one day, he will take her there. That night, 
   Stephen and Solange hear Jenny scream and discover her in the family 
   crypt, white as a ghost. She tells Stephen a story that he finds 
   quite unbelievable, so he calls her personal physician, Dr. Dereck 
   Joyce (Marino Mas&eacute;, as &quot;Lawrence Clift&quot;; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#PlayMotel1979">PLAY
    MOTEL</A></B> - 1979), to come and stay with them (Stephen believes 
   his plan of driving Jenny crazy is working like a charm, not knowing 
   that forces more evil than him are at work). Jenny tells Dr. Joyce 
   (who has treated Jenny in the past for &quot;emotional&quot; issues) 
   that she fears someone or something is taking over her body and he 
   tells her that he is going to help her whether she likes it or not. 
   Stephen invites the doctor to come to his laboratory to see his 
   reanimation experiments and Jenny laughs out loud, much in the same 
   way Muriel mocked Stephen's experiments. Dr. Joyce begins treating 
   Jenny and soon discovers everything she is telling him may be true 
   (Jenny finds an earring that doesn't belong to her in the same place 
   she dropped it in a dream and Dr. Joyce notices it's the same earring 
   Muriel is wearing in a portrait). At dinner, Solange seriously cuts 
   her hand, so Stephen brings her to his laboratory, telling Dr. Joyce 
   she has a rare blood disease and must stop the hemorrhaging before 
   she bleeds to death. We then discover that Stephen is keeping Solange 
   young by using Muriel's blood in a solution he invented, telling 
   Solange this is the last shot he can give her because he is out of blood.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While Dr. Joyce searches the family crypt (finding Muriel's tomb 
   empty), Muriel contacts Jenny, telling her to go to the laboratory. 
   From this point on, Jenny is now fully possessed by Muriel and Dr. 
   Joyce&nbsp; believes it after seeing the proof for himself. Solange 
   tries to tell Stephen that Jenny is Muriel, but he doesn't believe 
   her, rather believing that his plan is coming to fruition. He does 
   know that Dr. Joyce discovered Muriel's tomb was empty, so he must 
   find a way to stop the doctor from telling anyone else.&nbsp; Dr. 
   Joyce tells Stephen that there are ghosts in the castle and, for the 
   sake of Jenny's sanity, they must leave the castle immediately. 
   Stephen, with Solange's help, comes up with a way to dispose both 
   Jenny and Dr. Joyce, but will he be able to pull it off or will 
   Muriel get the revenge against Stephen he so richly deserves? 
   Unfortunately, instead of killing Dr. Joyce and Jenny, he kills his 
   butler, Jonathan (Giuseppe Addobbati, as &quot;John McDouglas&quot;; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EerieMidnight1974">THE

   Gothic horror genre would not have been popular if not for her. But 
   everyone is excellent here in their roles, especially Paul Muller

   enjoys inflicting pain. This film is not kid's stuff because it is

   (known in the U.S. as <B><A HREF="stage_fright_1980.htm">STAGE FRIGHT</A></B>)
    is one of those films, a slasher flick with a nice bloody body 
   count. In 1963, little Cathy causes a car accident when she wakes up 
   in the backseat and catches her sluttish mother fooling around with 
   some guy in the front seat (This isn't the first time Cathy has 
   caught dear old Mom cheating on Dad). Mom goes flying through the 
   front windshield and dies, while Cathy cries &quot;Mommy! Mommy!&quot;
    and tries to pull her back into the car (Cathy actually kills her 
   mother when she pulls her through the broken windshield and slits her 
   throat on a piece of jagged glass). Little Cathy is ostracized by her 
   callous father (&quot;You killed your mother! You killed her!&quot;), 
   who wants nothing more to do with her and puts her up for adoption. 
   Little Cathy is a changed girl because whenever she sees broken glass 
   or hears the sound of glass breaking, she gets a little psychotic 
   (When her new foster father tries to give her a kiss goodnight and a 
   water glass breaks [I believe sexual abuse is implied here], Cathy 
   slashes his face with a shard of the broken glass). Seventeen years 
   pass (to the day of the fatal car accident) and Cathy, who has 
   changed her name to Helen Selleck (Jenny Neumann), is a struggling 
   actress auditioning for a stage play. The director, George D'alberg 
   (Max Phipps), gives Helen a major part in the play, but she seems 
   disappointed she got it. Meanwhile, someone wearing high heels and 
   black gloves is murdering a naked couple with a shard of broken 
   glass, who are having sex in an abandoned building (Not only is the 
   sex near-pornographic, but so are the murders, as the naked man is 
   castrated and the nude woman is repeatedly stabbed in her breasts). 
   Could Helen be responsible for these murders? She begins to have a 
   romantic relationship with her co-star Terry (Gary Sweet), but wants 
   him to move slow because, in her own words: &quot;I've never had a 
   boyfriend before. I've never been allowed. If we're 
   careful...maybe.&quot; (Man, that doesn't sound good!). George tells 
   Helen, Terry and the rest of the cast that the play is a &quot;comedy 
   about death&quot; and when he asks Helen if anyone close to her has 
   died, she goes into a laughing/crying jag and runs off the stage. 
   Terry hears Helen screaming at another woman in her room and watches 
   as the mysterious woman in high heels and black gloves leaves the 
   room. It's now obvious even to the most retarded of viewers that 
   Helen has a Norman/Mother Bates split personality thing going on and 
   soon she begins murdering members of the stage play using her alter 
   ego, beginning with stage hand Angela (Briony Behets), who gets 
   stabbed over and over with a shard of glass because she yelled at 
   Terry for whistling backstage (apparently, that's a sign of bad luck 
   in theater circles). The police are called in to investigate and, 
   incredulously, the rest of the theater troupe blames Angela's death 
   on Terry for whistling<A HREF="stage_fright_1980.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/stage fright 1980 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="268" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   backstage! We soon find out that Helen's evil side is named Cathy 
   (surprise!) and even the mere sound of breaking glass (even a bottle 
   rolling across the floor) causes Helen to transform into Cathy. The 
   opening night of the play is a rousing success (even with forgotten 
   lines and a disasterous curtain call), but gay theater critic Bennett 
   Collingswood (John Michael Howson, one of the film's story 
   co-writers), an old nemesis of director George, ravages the play in 
   his review, but praises Helen's performance. At a party celebrating 
   the play's success, Bennett makes the mistake of feeling Helen up 
   (Wait a minute, I thought he was gay?!?), which turns out to be his 
   fatal error. He gets a shard of glass impaled in his neck, courtesy 
   of Cathy, and his scathing review of the play is never published. 
   Things come to a boil on the second night of the play, where 
   Helen/Cathy begins murdering the actors and crew during the play 
   until only Terry is left alive. Will Terry survive the night and, 
   better still, will the theater-goers get their money refunded for 
   watching only half a play?&nbsp; There is no rocket science involved 
   here in the story, just plenty of bloody good slasher fun. Director 
   John Lamond (one of Australia's first sexploitation directors, with 
   films like <B><A HREF="australia_after_dark_1974.htm">AUSTRALIA AFTER DARK</A></B>

   (most of Cathy's victims are either totally naked or have touched her 
   in an inappropriate manner) and the other is a means of execution 
   (one of Cathy's victims, Fay [Sue Jones], throws-up while she is 
   being slashed to death with a shard of glass, something I have never 
   seen before on film). So, if bloody deaths and naked bodies sounds

    her late husband's jewelry, Omar peeks into his crystal ball and is 
   possessed by Clinton, who we find out was fucked to death by a 
   succubus and then spontaneously combusted. Poor Omar is also killed 
   by the succubus, whose hands reach through the crystal ball and rip 
   his head off (which leads into a hilarious musical segue to the 
   opening credits, thanks to Sonye and his band, Haunted Garage, who 
   supply songs to the film's soundtrack). We are then introduced to 
   three homely sorority girls of Tri Eta Pi (groan!), all alone in 
   their sorority house: Melody (Quigley, wearing an ugly set of fake 
   buck teeth), Marci (Stevens, with her hair pulled back and wearing 
   geeky eyeglasses) and Mickey (Bauer, in a fat suit complete with 
   latex makeup appliances). While they are commiserating on why they 
   can't get boyfriends, Marci comes home with a box of junk she picked 
   up at a flea market. One of the items is the late Omar's crystal 
   ball, so you know there's going to be trouble soon. The girls decide 
   to throw a party, so Melody calls her equally geeky almost-boyfriend 
   Kevin (Richard Gabai) and asks him to come over and bring two male 
   friends with him. Kevin and his nerdy pledge brothers, Freddy 
   (Matthew Vaughter) and Duane (William Dristas), are forbidden to go 
   to the party by cruel fraternity pledge masters Phil (Timothy 
   Kauffman), J.J. (Matthew Phelps) and Bud (C.J. Cox), but they sneak 
   out a window and go anyway. After playing a game of Twister in the 
   backyard (Where Mickey nearly crushes everyone to death), the group 
   decides to hold a s&eacute;ance using the crystal ball. The girls 
   become possessed by the succubi and are turned into beautiful 
   sexbombs after being warned by the disembodied head of Omar and 
   before you can say &quot;Hey, my clothes fell off!&quot;, the three 
   girls are topless and tempting the guys with pie and sex! When Phil 
   and his fraternity brothers discover their pledges' treachery, they 
   head over to the sorority house and can't believe their eyes when 
   they peek through the window. Only Kevin keeps a straight head about 
   him and tries to find a way to reverse the curse (although he's not 
   above peeping on the girls through a keyhole as they take a naked 
   bubble bath together). Phil and his fraternity brothers get their 
   just desserts (all three get their dicks bit off [offscreen]) and are 
   turned into piles of ashes, while Kevin and his friends try to return 
   the girls back to their homely selves. Perhaps an exorcist will do 
   the trick?&nbsp; <B><A HREF="nightmare_sisters_1987b.htm">NIGHTMARE SISTERS</A></B>

   widowed scientist invents a behavior modification machine called 
   Apache which has proven successful in turning dangerous animals into 
   docile ones in this strange, seldom seen, dip into insanity. The 
   scientist&#146;s assistant (Debbie Laster) decides to use Apache on 
   human subjects, much to her boss&#146; disapproval. Apache takes

   Whenever Jessica gets into trouble (which is often), George 
   interfaces with Apache to inflict some ball-bearing justice. The 
   assistant unleashes Apache on a houseload of teens which changes 
   their behavior drastically, to say the least. From this point on, 
   this American, English and French co-production (lensed in Florida) 
   loses all sense or logic (for what little it had to begin with). Even 
   though it is apparent that this film faced the censor's knife to 
   obtain an R rating, the last ten minutes are incomprehensible. The 
   ending leaves you shaking your head, wondering if screenwriter George 
   Faget-Bernard even thought to write one. This is the kind of movie

    you have any feline pets at home, make sure they are not around when 
   you watch this strange Mexican horror film. Millionaire Hugo (Hugo 
   Stiglitz) travels around in his helicopter looking for good-looking 
   women to pick up and bring to his remote monastary. He wines and 
   dines and then murders them, cutting off their heads for display in 
   glass jars in his trophy room and feeding their leftover flesh to the 
   thousand (actually about one hundred) hungry cats he keeps trapped in 
   the basement. Hugo&#146;s trusty mute manservant Dorgo (Gerardo 
   Zepeda) then disposes of the unused body parts in a huge furnace. 
   Hugo, like his ancestors, is a collector. Only he collects heads 
   instead of coins,<A HREF="night_of_a_thousand_cats_1972d.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/night of a thousand cats.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="282" HEIGHT="178" VSPACE="4" HSPACE="5" BORDER="5"></A> 
   stamps or wild animals that his forebearers were fond of. His latest 
   would-be victim is Cathy (Anjanette Comer), a married woman with a 
   small daughter. While her husband is away on business, she shacks up 
   with Hugo for a night of passion. She is saved from certain doom when 
   an unexpected visitor knocks on the monastary door. A doctor, whose 
   car has broken down, wants to use the phone to call a taxi. Cathy, 
   finally realizing that she should get back home to her daughter, 
   excuses herself and drives home. Hugo, distressed that he did not get 
   head, cuts off the doctor&#146;s instead and feeds the remains to the 
   cats. Still upset about his failure to obtain Cathy&#146;s head, Hugo 
   reminisces about his past achievements (told in flashback form) and 
   plays chess with Dorgo. When Dorgo wins a game, Hugo makes him the 
   latest addition to his trophy case (what a sore loser!). After&nbsp; 
   much&nbsp; persistence,&nbsp; Hugo&nbsp; persuades Cathy to return 
   with him to the monastary. After some lovemaking, he shows her the 
   trophy room. When she sees the heads in the jars, she wises up and 
   tries to run away. She accidentally opens the cats&#146; cage and 
   they attack Hugo, devouring him in the trophy room. Cathy escapes the 
   cats and drives off to live her life with her unsuspecting husband 
   and daughter. This is by no means a good film but it does have a few 
   effective moments. The scenes of the trapped cats are well handled. 
   They actually look menacing with their snarling faces and wild 
   demeanor. So effective, in fact, that my two cats (who were sleeping 
   beside me) would pick up their heads and give me a nasty stare every 
   time the cats would appear on screen. It was at these moments that I 
   realized that my cats could probably rip me apart if they wanted to. 
   Luckily for me, I keep them well fed and give them plenty of love. 
   Director Rene Cardona Jr. uses slow-motion to good effect, as we 
   witness cats flying through the air and victims running away from the 
   demented Hugo. While Cardona has made his share of stinkers (</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="tintorera_1977.htm">TINTORERA</A></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">

   laboratory. He transplants the girl's heart into his son's body. 
   (More open heart surgery footage.) Meanwhile, the police lieutenant 
   is trying to solve a series of murders (including a man who has his 
   eye ripped out in extreme close-up) he attributes to a &quot;half 
   man, half beast&quot;. The Doc's operation is a success and his son 
   reverts back to his normal self. Well, at least for a couple of 
   minutes. Sonny boy changes back to ape man and goes on another 
   killing spree, murdering the Doc's assistant (by ripping his head 
   off), a policeman (by scalping him), and attacking the lady wrestler. 
   The police capture him after he changes back to normal and is taken 
   to the hospital for observation. He transforms again and takes a 
   little girl hostage. The Doc talks his ape man son into handing over 
   the girl and the police open fire and shoot him. Son changes back. 
   Doc apologizes to son. Son dies. Doc goes crazy. This dubbed Mexican 
   horror film is extremely violent for its' time. It's chock full of 
   nudity and bloody gore unusual for the late sixties. Gorgon Video got 
   its' hands on a pristine print of this little-seen wonder that has 
   crisp color and clean sound (unusual for this type of release).

    least interesting of the trio. Nurse Lena Aruza (Marlene Clark; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackMamba">BLACK
    MAMBA</A></B>) and nurse friend Francisca (Rosemarie Gil; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#DevilWoman1973">DEVIL
    WOMAN</A></B>) are in the jungle looking for plants to use in 
   medicine, when they spot the &quot;herb of long life&quot;. Francisca 
   doesn't believe in such nonsense, but since they are both nurses 
   during World War II in an area of the Philippines that is teeming 
   with enemy Japanese soldiers, Lena figures she can chew the herb to 
   stay alert during the long hours she works at the mobile hospital 
   where she and Francisca assist doctors patching-up injured soldiers. 
   Lena finds a cave next to the rare herb and decides to explore it 
   while Francisca keeps a lookout for the Japs. The cave is full of 
   paintings of snakes and Lena is bitten by a rare Firebrand cobra (it 
   has a red diamond-shaped marking on its neck), while Francisca is 
   attacked and raped by a Japanese soldier (played by Filipino genre 
   vet Vic Diaz; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Superbeast1972">SUPERBEAST</A></B> 
   - 1972). Lena transforms into the Cobra Woman (complete with red 
   diamond marking on her neck) and suddenly becomes one with the 
   snakes, while the Japanese soldier shoots Francisca once he gets his 
   rocks off and throws branches over her body. Lena uses her 
   newly-gained snake powers to heal Francisca and the film then 
   switches to the present day (well, 1972, anyway), where Dr. Terzon 
   (Vic Silayan; <B><A HREF="daughters_of_satan_1972.htm">DAUGHTERS OF SATAN</A></B> 
   - 1972) is explaining to his UNICEF medical students the unknown 
   qualities of snake venom enzymes. UNICEF student Joanna (Joy Bang; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Messiah Of Evil">MESSIAH
    OF EVIL</A></B> - 1973) wants to study the venom of the Firebrand 
   cobra, but Dr. Terzon tells her that species of snake is probably 
   extinct, except for rumors of a &quot;woman in the hills&quot; (care 
   to guess who that is?) who may have one. Rumors also say that anyone 
   bitten by a Firebrand cobra (combined with chewing on the &quot;herb 
   of life&quot;) will stay young forever, so Joanna sets out to find 
   Lena to see if the rumors are true. Joanna finds Lena's jungle house 
   rather easily and when she knocks on the door, she is greeted by an 
   old-looking Francisca and is chased away by Francisca's obviously 
   retarded son, Lope (Vic Diaz again, only this time he's a mute and 
   slightly hunchbacked, with big buck teeth and a deformed right eye). 
   Joanna heads back to he apartment, eats a box of Cheerios (!) and 
   masturbates in her bed, fantasizing about her boyfriend Duff (Roger 
   Garrett), who is about to arrive in Manila to keep her company. When 
   Duff arrives (and steals an eagle off the streets, which he names 
   Dirk!), he decides to visit Lena on his own and is bitten by Lena's 
   pet Firebrand cobra, Movini, on his way to her house. Lena (who 
   hasn't aged a day in 27 years) saves Duff, but when he wakes up, it 
   is Francisca who is by his bed and she explains that her son Lope 
   became deformed when he made love to Lena. It turns out that 
   Francisca is not the biggest fan of Lena and she agrees to go get 
   Joanna and Duff's pet eagle and bring them back to the house (It 
   would seem eagles and Firebrand cobras a<A HREF="night_of_the_cobra_woman_1972b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/night of the cobra woman poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="185" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>re
    mortal enemies). Trouble ensues when Lena wants to keep Duff for 
   herself and sends Movini to kill Francisca (successful) and Joanna 
   (unsuccessful). When Dirk kills Movini (turns out that Lena needs to 
   be bitten by Movini on a regular basis or she will grow old), it sets 
   off a chain of events that puts everyone's lives in danger (Lena is 
   forced to suck the life out of several locals and tourists to remain 
   young). Can Joanna and Dr. Terzon come up with an antidote to Lena's 
   youth-sucking powers before she sucks all the life out of Duff?&nbsp; <B><A HREF="night_of_the_cobra_woman_1972b.htm">NIGHT
    OF THE COBRA WOMAN</A></B> is a fairly cheap and badly acted horror 
   film (the usually dependable Joy Bang [who had a short, but memorable 
   acting career] looks like she is reading off of cue cards and 
   everyone else seems like they are walking around in a hypnotic 
   trance), complete with crappy time-lapse transformations and lots of 
   female nudity. Director/screenwriter Andrew Meyer (an Andy Warhol 
   prot&eacute;g&eacute; who directed an obscure film called <B>THE SKY PIRATE</B> 
   [1970], then directed the U.S. insert footage [featuring Lorne 
   Greene] to a Japanese disaster film that was released here as <B><A HREF="tidal_wave_1973_1975.htm">TIDAL
    WAVE</A></B> [1973/1975] and then disappeared from view, until his 
   death in 1987) moves this film at such a slow pace, it's almost 
   sleep-inducing (I really believe he had someone hypnotize the actors, 
   because most of them talk in slow, monosyllabic tones). The only time 
   the film picks up steam is when Marlene Clark drops her top or when 
   Vic Diaz is on-screen. Diaz manages to give Lope a soul (I'm still 
   trying to figure out the symbolism of why he carries around a hat 
   made of feathers, though), even if he does look ridiculous in his 
   hunchback getup. There's also a tasteless scene of monkey 
   experimentation, skin peeling (Lena sheds her skin when she sucks the 
   life out of her victims) and some pretty poor old age makeups, but 
   that doesn't detract from the fact that 85% of the film is a bore. 
   Also starring Slash Marks (the worst actor in the film and that's 
   saying a lot!), Bert Rivera and Logan Clarke. Released theatrically 
   by Roger Corman's New World Pictures. The VHS tape released by <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Embassy">Embassy
    Home Entertainment</A> is an edited, though still R-rated, 76-minute 
   version of the film that is missing nearly nine minutes of footage 
   shown in the theatrical release. Most of the missing footage is 
   exposition, so count your blessings (although Joanna's masturbation 
   and a hotel room attack scene [with a cameo by the director] seems to 
   be missing some footage). Available on <A HREF="night_of_the_cobra_woman_1972_dvd2.htm">DVD</A> 
   in its original aspect ratio by <A HREF="http://www.scorpionreleasing.com">Scorpion
    Releasing</A>. It's the only way to watch it, even though it is the 
   same 76 minute version that is on the tape, only in widescreen. Also 
   included on the DVD are on-camera interviews with Producer Roger

   I love foreign horror films. Unlike some horror fanatics, I 
   appreciate foreign horror films because they show American audiences 
   something they have never seen before: Horror based on that country's 
   history, traditions and legends. When I see something I don't 
   understand, rather that throwing up my hands and screaming

    We see a man (Gianni Garko; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Devil Fish">DEVIL
    FISH</A></B> - 1984), all bloody and bruised, stumbling through the 
   forest and passing out on the bank of a river. We then 
   flash-forward&nbsp; to a short time later, where the man is going 
   through some type of therapy at the Salus Clinic, a psychiatric facility<A HREF="night_of_the_devils_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/night of the devils dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   (he has all sorts of electrodes attached to his head). We get to see 
   what is in his mind, including a hand fondling a woman's vagina and 
   breasts, x-rays of a human skull and then a woman's head graphically 
   exploding. He then sees two people in white robes inspecting a naked 
   woman in a cell. One of them pulls the woman's still-beating heart 
   out of her chest with his bare hands (all these visions are very 
   gory). Professor Tosi (Umberto Raho; <A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EerieMidnight1974"><B>THE
    EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW</B></A> - 1974), the clinic's head 
   psychiatrist, holds a mirror to the man's face and asks him if he 
   recognizes himself or understands English. He just sits there 
   silently. The police commissioner (Tom Felleghy; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Eyeball1975">EYEBALL</A></B> 
   - 1975) tells Professor Tosi that he will release a photo of the man 
   to the Press in hope they can identify him, but judging by the 
   clothes he wore when he was found, he must be quite wealthy. 
   Professor Tosi tells the commissioner that he believes the man has 
   total amnesia, somehow caused by darkness. When they turn off the 
   lights in his hospital room, he becomes agitated and stares out the 
   window like he is waiting for someone or something to arrive. One 
   night, while he is staring out the window, the man sees a car pull up 
   to the clinic gates. A young woman gets out of the car and her face 
   makes the man terribly nervous. The woman tells Professor Tosi that 
   she met the man a week ago, telling Tosi that the man told her he was 
   buying lumber for his company. She tells the doctor that&nbsp; the 
   man's name is Nicola, but she doesn't know his last name (&quot;I can 
   only tell you he's an honest man.&quot;). She asks the doctor if she 
   can see Nicola and when he sees her, he screams, &quot;No! No! No! 
   Let me out!&quot;. The staff has to restrain and drug Nicola and the 
   woman disappears, nowhere to be found. The Professor finds her purse, 
   but it lacks any personal items that a woman would carry in it. While 
   Nicola is drugged, he has a long flashback that explains what 
   happened to him a week earlier.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Nicola is driving down a road and almost hits a witch (Maria Monti; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WhatDoneSolange1972">WHAT
    HAVE YOU DONE TO SOLANGE?</A></B> - 1972), who is dressed in black, 
   forcing him off the road and disabling his car. The witch is nowhere 
   to be found, so Nicola walks through the forest to try to find 
   someone to help him. Nicola doesn't see a family digging a grave (but 
   they see him) in an ancient cemetery and burying someone wrapped in a 
   bloody sheet. An old man named Gorca Ciuvelak (William Vanders; <B><A HREF="inglorious_bastards_1978.htm">THE
    INGLORIOUS BASTARDS</A></B> - 1978) throws an ugly idol on the grave 
   and they head back to their village (Gorca's son, Jovan [Mark 
   Roberts; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#NightEvelynGrave71">THE 
   NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE</A></B> - 1971] asks his father 
   what they should do about the stranger and he says, &quot;Take care 
   of him.&quot;). When Nicola makes it to the village, he discovers no 
   one will talk to him except for Gorca, who tells him the village is 
   in mourning because he just buried his brother. Since it is going to 
   be dark in about and hour, Gorca invites Nicola to stay at his house 
   with his family. At dinner, Jovan tells Nicola that he will fix his 
   car, saying, &quot;Tomorrow. Tomorrow when the sun is shining.&quot; 
   That night, Nicola hears a strange howling and then someone knocking 
   on the door. He asks Jovan if he is going to answer the door and he 
   says, &quot;No. Nobody comes at night.&quot; It is plain to see that 
   the family is scared of something, since there are bars on the 
   windows and all the doors are securely bolted. What could cause a 
   family (hell, the entire village) to be afraid of the night?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see the witch go to the freshly dug grave, slice her hand 
   open on a piece of broken glass and lets her blood drip on the fresh 
   flowers put on the grave. What is she up to? Jovan then tries to 
   sleep with his dead Uncle's young wife Sdenka (Agostina Belli; <B><A HREF="scream_of_the_demon_lover_1970.htm">SCREAM
    OF THE DEMON LOVER</A></B> - 1970), who looks exactly like the woman 
   who visited Nicola in the loony bin. She tells Jovan, &quot;No, he 
   just died this morning!&quot; The next day, Jovan and Nicola&nbsp; 
   use some oxen to pull his car to the village. Gorca tells Jovan that 
   he must leave the village and Jovan replies that if he is not back by 
   6:00 PM, &quot;You're finished. You'll never be able to return!&quot; 
   Gorca then leaves the village, but where is he going? Gorca's other 
   son, Vlado (Luis Su&aacute;rez; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#FeastOfSatan">THE
    FEAST OF SATAN</A></B> - 1971), and his wife, Elena (Teresa Gimpera; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Crypt of Living Dea">CRYPT
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> - 1973), call Nicola to come to their 
   house, where Vlado shows him deep scratch marks on the side of his 
   house, which look like they were made by a human hand. Vlado tells 
   Nicola not to worry because, &quot;By tomorrow, the danger will have 
   disappeared...and gone underground.&quot; What does he mean by that? 
   Vlado then tells Nicola that his Uncle didn't die yesterday, but a 
   month ago and Jovan killed him. Could Nicola be next?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Gorca carrying a sharpened stick, as he goes looking for 
   the witch. We also discover that the witch is pregnant and has an 
   aversion to sunlight. She waits for Gorca to arrive, holding the ugly 
   idol and an ox horn in her hands.&nbsp; Gorca enters her barn and 
   picks up the idol. The witch cackles and we see the idol fall to the 
   ground, Gorca's fate unknown. Gorca's very young granddaughter, Mira 
   (Sabrina Tamborra) tells Nicola about the witch and how her 
   grandfather went to kill her (When Nicola asks her why the witch 
   doesn't come to get them during the daytime, she says, &quot;Witches 
   are like evil spirits. All bad things go around after dark.&quot; Ah, 
   the wisdom of children!). She tells Nicola that the only way to kill 
   a witch is to pierce her in the heart with a sharpened stick. But it 
   will not be easy. If Grandpa fails to kill her, he will become one of 
   &quot;them&quot;. As it is approaching 6:00 PM, Nicola sees Jovan 
   sharpening a stick. He plans on killing Gorca if he doesn't come home 
   on time. Nicola tells Jovan that if he kills his father he will go to 
   the authorities. Jovan tells him to mind his own business. Exactly at 
   6:00 PM, Gorca arrives at the house, shows everyone a severed hand 
   and announces, &quot;The curse has been broken.&quot; But has it?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This is an atmospheric take on the vampire legend, inspired by

   since the early 1930's (he passed away in 1981), many <A HREF="night_of_the_devils_1972_foreign_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/night of the devils italy poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="203" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>of
    those films documentaries about Italy's past. I think that is why 
   this film is so affecting, as Ferroni has an eye for even the 
   smallest of details, transporting us back to a time when people 
   believed in witches and other evils of the night. While very little 
   blood drinking is on view (the only instance of it comes later in the 
   film when Mira bites Elena on her neck and then exposes her breast!), 
   Ferroni makes sure that the red stuff flows freely, as we see beating 
   human hearts, exploding heads and other bloody visuals (special 
   effects supplied by Carlo Rambaldi; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BayOfBlood1971">A
    BAY OF BLOOD</A></B> - 1971; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DeepRed1975">DEEP
    RED</A></B> - 1975), including Vlado skinning a rabbit. The film's 
   highlight is when Jovan discovers Gorca is one of them. He shoves a 
   sharpened stick into Gorca's chest and twists it (nothing is left to 
   the imagination) and then we watch as Gorca decomposes (masterfully 
   done). It is this scene and what happens after it, that put Nicola in 
   the mental hospital. His mind can't accept what is happening around 
   him. I am sure that people raised during the Technological Age would 
   react the same way. We refuse to accept what we can't understand (In 
   this &quot;Age of Trump&quot;, more and more people are catching this 
   sickness. Shit, now I have dated this review in the years to come!). 
   When Nicola finally accepts what is happening around him and tries to 
   save new love Sdenka, he makes a terrible discovery that his mind 
   just cannot accept. And that what makes this film so enjoyable. The 
   old ways always wins, no matter how advanced society has become. But 
   then the film throws us a monkey wrench: Is Nicola actually crazy and 
   was this whole story just a figment of his twisted imagination? The 
   twisty screenplay, by Eduardo Manzanos <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#StrangeViceWardh71">THE

   film's haunting music score. Gaslini plays the music theme by memory 
   and tells us it was the only time he composed music while actually 
   seeing seeing the film shot. Usually music composers are given a 
   final cut and compose the music after the fact. He tells us this was 
   the only time he has done that in the over forty films he has scored 
   and he wishes he was able to do it more. He considers it his best 
   music score. I agree. This is a superb film made at the height of 
   Italian horror. Also starring Cinzia De Carolis, Rosita Torosh, 
   Stefano Oppedisano and John Bartha. <B>Not Rated</B> (full of 
   full-frontal female nudity and scenes of extreme bloody gore).</FONT></FONT></P>

   In the jungles of Bombasa in the year 1910, a tribe of natives are 
   performing a voodoo ceremony where they tie a captive white woman 
   between two trees and whip her until she is bloody (and naked). The 
   witch doctor then rapes her and a female member cuts the woman's head 
   off while she is on an altar, the rest of the female tribe members 
   smearing the blood flowing from her neck stump all over their faces. 
   A rescue party shows up a few moments too late and guns down all the 
   tribe members in retaliation, then noticing that the dead woman's 
   head is still alive sporting vampire fangs and she's really angry. 
   During the present day, an expedition, led by professors Jonathan 
   (Jack Taylor) and Carter (Simon Andreu), is camped in the same area 
   doing a survey of near-extinct animals. Along for the ride are rich 
   bitch Meredith, who financed the expedition, and an all-girl crew 
   (lucky bastards). Camped just a couple of hundred yards away from the 
   sacrificial altar where the woman lost her head in 1910, the crew 
   begin to experience mysterious goings-on in the<A HREF="night_of_the_sorcerers_1970.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/night of the sorcerers vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   night, when they're not fighting over the attention of Carter, that 
   is. Carol (Loli Tovar), a photographer, wanders too close to the 
   altar one night and becomes the first victim. She is whipped and 
   stripped by the white vampire witch (who now has a body). The dead 
   tribepeople arise from their rocky graves and watch as the vampire 
   witch beheads Carol, turning her into a vampire witch also. It's not 
   long before more women from the expedition are sacrificed and turned 
   into vampire witches, much to the annoyance of Jonathan and Carter. 
   When Jonathan discovers Carol's camera in the jungle and develops the 
   film, the head vampire witch kills him, drowning him in the 
   developing fluid. Carter goes on the offensive, but when Jonathan 
   rises from the dead, it's one of the women who steps up and lays his 
   soul to rest with a flaming death. Carter saves the last remaining 
   girl from sacrifice (by throwing his gunbelt into a fire) only to 
   discover the hard way that he is too late as they drive off into the 
   sunset. This is a pretty slow-moving Spanish horror film that perks 
   up during the sacrifice scenes, but stands still during the rest of 
   the running time. Director/screenwriter Amando de Ossorio (the <B><A HREF="blind_dead_series.htm">BLIND

   - 1973) gives us plenty of nudity, gore and slow-motion shots of the 
   vampire witches running around in their leopard skin bikinis, but he 
   unfortunately forgot to put any plot in his script. The blood flows 
   rather freely (usually over the naked bodies of the female cast), but 
   without a coherent story to go along with it, it basically means very 
   little. As with most foreign horror films, the dubbing leaves a lot 
   to be desired, such as this exchange between Carter and a guide when 
   Carter discovers Jonathan's body: Carter: &quot;He's suffered an 
   accident.&quot; Guide: &quot;Grave?&quot; Carter: &quot;Mortal.&quot; 
   Guide: &quot;Mortal?&quot; The whole idea of white vampire women 
   running around the jungles of Africa (It actually looks like the 
   forests of Spain. The foliage is all wrong.) seems a little 
   ridiculous as does the method to kill them: Remove the band of cloth 
   they wear around their neck and their head falls off! I'm not sure 
   what de Ossorio was aiming for here, mixing vampirism and voodoo in 
   Africa, but at least he gives us plentiful nudity, a couple of 
   decapitations and other assorted bloodletting. Stay away from the 
   version issued on VHS by <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Unicorn">Unicorn

    OF THE WEREWOLF</A><A NAME="NightOfThe Werewolf"></A> (1980) -</B> 
   In 16th Century Hungary, the Countess Elizabeth Bathory (Julia Saly) 
   and her followers, including werewolf Waldemar Daninsky (Paul 
   Naschy), are convicted of crimes against humanity, including 
   vampirism, cannibalism and the slaughter of countless virgin women 
   and children. At their death sentences, most of the Countess' 
   followers get off easy with simple hangings or beheadings, but the 
   Countess herself is buried alive (but not before cursing everyone 
   responsible and their descendants) and Waldemar must wear the 
   &quot;Mask Of Dishonor&quot; and then had a silver cross impaled into 
   his heart. Of all the people convicted, only Waldemar seems to be 
   thankful for death. In the present day, anthropologist and witchcraft 
   expert Erika (Silvia Aguilar) and her friends Karen (Azucena 
   Hernandez) and Barbara (Pilar Alcon) have discovered the burial site 
   of Countess Bathory at a castle in the Carpathian Mountains. Erika 
   (who is power mad and inherently evil) has also murdered an elderly 
   professor (Narcisco Ibanez Menta) for a medallion he possesses that 
   can return the Countess back to life. At the same time, two grave 
   robbers loot Waldemar's tomb and pull the silver cross from his 
   corpse. That <A HREF="night_of_the_werewolf_1980.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/night of the werewolf dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>was
    really stupid because, for one thing, there's a full moon in the 
   night sky and as soon as the cross is removed, Waldemar turns into a 
   werewolf and rips-out the throats of the two grave robbers. Waldemar 
   takes up residence in the castle and, along with facially-scarred 
   female assistant Mircaya (Beatriz Elorrietta), invites Erika and her 
   two friends to stay with him in the castle. Erika immediately 
   recognizes Waldemar (who is now using the name &quot;Janus&quot;), 
   but doesn't let him know. Waldemar also knows that Erika is evil 
   (even Mircaya warns him), but he finds her friend Karen irresistible 
   and they fall in love. While Waldemar chows-down on the peasant 
   population (he nearly kills Karen, but Mircaya chases him away with 
   the silver cross), Erika kills Barbara and uses her blood, along with 
   the medallion, to revive Countess Bathory. The Countess puts the bite 
   on Erika and orders her to bring Waldemar to her. Waldemar and Karen 
   work together trying to stop a series of vampire attacks that are 
   striking the countryside. As the next full moon draws near, Waldemar 
   must figure out a way to defeat the Countess, unaware that she has 
   secretly bitten Karen. What's a good werewolf to do?&nbsp; This is 
   the ninth entry (original Spanish title: <B><A HREF="retorno_del_hombre_lobo_1980.htm">EL
    RETORNO DEL HOMBRE LOBO</A></B>) in the continuing saga of werewolf 
   Waldemar Daninsky (it follows <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#WerewolfAndTheYeti">THE
    WEREWOLF AND THE YETI</A></B> - 1975) and the first to be directed 
   by Paul Naschy (billed in the credits here as &quot;Jack 
   Molina&quot;), although he did write the scripts for most of them 
   (including this one) under his real name, Jacinto Molina. While 
   basically nothing but a reworking of director Leon Klimovsky's <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Werewolf Shadow">WEREWOLF
    SHADOW</A></B> (1970; a.k.a. <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Werewolf Shadow">THE
    WEREWOLF VS. THE VAMPIRE WOMAN</A></B>), this film is beautifully 
   photographed and contains some grand sweeping camerawork. 
   Unfortunately, the film is rather subdued in it's bloodletting, which 
   is disappointing. Although there is plenty of blood on view, there is 
   precious little gore to go along with it. To illustrate my point, 
   there's a scene where Erika brings the body of Mircaya to the 
   Countess and Erika slits Mircaya's throat with a dagger and the blood 
   falls over the Countess' face. While we see the blood cover her face, 
   we never actually see the throat slitting. It's quite easy to see 
   that Naschy was aiming for a gothic atmosphere here and in that 
   respect he succeeded completely. There are plenty of spooky shots, 
   such as when the Countess is revived and her disciples suddenly 
   rise-up from the earth; the Countess and Erika's first vampire attack 
   (They are shrouded in fog as two giant windows swing open revealing 
   the pair); and Karen saving Waldemar from a midnight visit by the 
   Countess. The sets are also very effective and put to good use, 
   especially the scene of the Countess and the two of her minions doing 
   a slow-motion walk to their coffins in the castle's decaying dungeon. 
   If you don't mind the low gore quotient, you will probably dig this 
   well-lensed horror film. Besides, who can resist watching Europe's 
   best-known werewolf taking-on the world's most sadistic female 
   vampire and a finale where no one in the cast is left alive? Naschy 
   would direct the next Waldemar Daninsky film, <B><A HREF="beast_and_the_magic_sword_1983.htm">THE

    Joni (Megan Wyss). As Snake (who is a Bible-quoting fanatic) and 
   Runner hide out in the basement, the party's guests arrive, which 
   also includes D.B. (Ron Thomas), Chris (Susan Lyles), Mason (Dan 
   Schramm), Brenda (Barbara Schoenhofer), Frannie (Diana Martin), Lisa 
   (Janette Allyson Caldwell) and Russell (Randy Lunsford). It becomes 
   obvious after a short time that there's more than one killer in this 
   house. Not only are the escaped cons lurking downstairs, but the 
   recently released mental patient also begins dispatching the young 
   partiers. It's obvious that one of the students is the mental 
   patient, but which one is it? There's plenty of suspects, including 
   David, who has to take medication for a mysterious condition, and 
   Joni, who is new in town and doesn't want to talk about her past. As 
   the young cast is either strangled by Snake or murdered by the 
   unknown killer (impaled by a fireplace poker; electrocuted in a hot 
   tub; crushed by a car; axe to the head; etc.), the dwindling number 
   of high schoolers must kill Snake and unmask the psycho killer. The 
   revelation of the mental case should come as no surprise to anyone, 
   since logic dictates it can only possibly be one person. The 
   ridiculous ending proves once again that the filmmakers here haven't 
   the slightest idea on how to end a slasher film properly.&nbsp; This 
   is an average mid-80's slasher flick that takes a while to get moving 
   after a fairly bloody first ten minutes, in order to introduce all 
   the character and set them up as red herrings. Director Allen Plone (<B><A HREF="phantom_of_the_ritz_1988.htm">PHANTOM
    OF THE RITZ</A></B> - 1988; <B><A HREF="sweet_justice_1992.htm">SWEET
    JUSTICE</A></B> - 1992), working with a script by Mitch Brian and 
   producer Dillis L. Hart II, makes sure to toss all the exploitable 
   elements into the mix, including plentiful female nudity (including a 
   porn clip on TV starring John Holmes and Seka), some bloody murders 
   and enough teen angst to supply a week's worth of CW programming. The 
   acting, by a cast of unknowns, is dicey at best (Joe Manno as David 
   is extremely annoying), but Plone supplies the viewer enough tits, 
   ass and gore to keep our eyes, if not our minds, occupied. There's 
   also some cheesy music (by a New wave band called The Dogs) and 
   synchronized dancing (by an all-female leotard-wearing dance troup 
   called The Sweetheart Dancers, who are simply terrible), as well as 
   some very bad editing (credited to Herbert L. Strock, the director of <B><A HREF="i_was_a_teenage_frankenstein_1957.htm">I
    WAS A TEENAGE FRANKENSTEIN</A></B> [1957], in one of his final 
   screen credits), especially in the first few minutes. Still, there 
   are some bloody deaths (one teen has his face pressed against a hot 
   grill while he is stabbed in the neck with a barbecue fork) and a lot 
   of exposed bare flesh to keep slasher fanatics happy. One major 
   disappointment, though, is that the escaped convict angle never 
   develops the way we are led to believe it will and, in the end, just 
   seems tacked-on and superfluous. The opening and closing tune,

   ago as an ugly old hag curses her two children (Barbara Monker and 
   Crackers Phinn) to age 10 years for every one year of their lives, 
   but never to die. Their only way of reversing the old age process is 
   to rip open the stomachs of human mortals and eat their innards. The 
   old hag also tells them that 12,000 years hence, when the twin stars 
   of the wolf flank the moon, they will be able to lift the curse if 
   they sacrifice a young virgin. Cut to 16 years ago, as we see the 
   elderly brother chow down on the intestines of a young boy and the 
   elderly sister do the same to a young girl. They both regain their 
   youth. The brother rents a room from a pretty young woman (a slightly 
   overweight Linnea Quigley) and pretty soon they fall in love and she 
   gets pregnant. She has a little girl whom they name Bondi (Tamara 
   Taylor). Daddy has plans for his little girl: He plans on sacrificing 
   her when she turns 16, so the curse will be lifted. Daddy shelters 
   his little girl from boys and sex and on her 16th birthday gives her 
   a magic amulet to protect her (it comes in handy when three boys in a 
   van try to rape her). After her mother and father have a serious 
   fight, Bondi runs away from home and shacks up in a abandoned ranch 
   house in the park occupied by Nick (Meeno Peluce) and Cowboy (Chris 
   Riley), two other runaways. The house is also the residence of the 
   cannibal sister, who now calls herself Patti. Nick meets a writer 
   (Aldo Ray, who had appeared in so much shit that flies were beginning 
   to follow him) who tells him stories of the grisly&nbsp; murders 
   that&nbsp; have happened in the park in the past. Nick spots a 
   picture of Patti in a book dated 1940 and grows suspicious. While 
   spying on Patti, Nick watches her munching down on the guts of 
   another unfortunate young female camper and goes to warn Cowboy and 
   Bondi, but Bondi has had a bad dream and ran out of the house only to 
   end up in a cave where her father is waiting to sacrifice her. Cowboy 
   tries to save her but is temporarily downed when Daddy shoots a beam

   mouth of the cave. For some unknown reason, Patti stops the sacrifice 
   and tells Bondi to swallow the amulet. Bondi transforms into the old 
   hag from the beginning of the film and curses her two siblings to 
   suffer the same fate as their victims. All the previous victims come 
   back to life and chow down on the pair, ripping them apart limb to 
   limb. Ray arrives at the cave and digs our young trio out. Later on, 
   everything seems normal as we see Bondi, Nick and Cowboy romping in a 
   playground. Nick asks Bondi to push him down the slide and the last 
   thing we see is Bondi with her hands on Nick's stomach and the sound 
   of Nick screaming. Like father, like daughter. The level of technical 
   ineptitude on display here is mind boggling. The editing of the film 
   and the music is amateurish at best, giving the film a choppy, 
   disjointed look that makes it extremely hard to follow. Even the 
   opening credits contain a gaffe as when it reads &quot;and

    Most of the blame must be put on the shoulders of first-time 
   director Lawrence D. Foldes, who gives the entire production a grade 
   school look, filming most scenes in long or medium shots with very 
   little close-ups. The actors must have had a hard time following his 
   direction, as they frequently stare directly into the camera as if to

   not found in the original films (The other two are <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Death Wish Club">DEATH

   The framing device has God (Ferdy Mayne) and Satan (billed only as 
   &quot;Lu Sifer&quot;, but actually actor Tony Giorgio) in the cabin 
   of a moving train arguing over who gets the souls of the people in 
   the three films while a really bad 80's rock band (in typically 
   excruciating period fashions) plays a catchy song called 'Dance With 
   Me' (&quot;Everybody has something to do......everybody but 
   you!&quot;) in the car next door. The framing device is actually 
   quite good (directed by Jay Schlossberg-Cohen) as God and Satan 
   discuss the merits of the people involved (&quot;Why don't we let him 
   spend 100 years in purgatory&quot; is a compromise they come to about 
   John Phillip Law's character in the first film) and even get digs 
   into each other. Satan says, after God tells him that he is unable to 
   cry, that he can laugh and that's all he needs. God replies, &quot;I 
   can laugh and cry at the same time.&quot; If you don't have the 
   patience to watch the full versions of all three films shown here, 
   this film shows the best parts and should want to make you seach out 
   the full versions.&nbsp; I have seen all three films and they are 
   worth it. The late Phillip Yordan sure had a way with words and 
   you'll appreciate the sly references and engrossing storytelling. 
   Sure, this film was made to cash in on the previous films, but this 
   is a good primer for anyone who wants to get into the mind of Mr. 
   Yordan. The additions to the films are stop-motion effects to the 
   deadly bug scene (including a tacked-on attack by the bug on a 
   love-making couple in a garden) and more a grisly electrocution in <B>DEATH
    WISH CLUB</B> (available in a differently-edited version titled <B><A HREF="carnival_of_fools_1981.htm">CARNIVAL
    OF FOOLS</A></B>) and various stop-motion effects of demons and 
   different deaths for Charles (Richard) Moll, Marc Lawrence (as a 
   Jewish concentration camp survivor) and Richard Grandmaison (as 
   Papini) in <B>THE NIGHTMARE NEVER ENDS</B> (also known as <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#SatansSupper1980">CATACLYSM</A></B>

    There's plenty of blood to keep the gorehound interested (including

   (1978) -</B> Bone-headed horror comedy with a disco soundtrack. Count 
   Dracula (John Carradine) has fallen on hard times. He is forced to 
   open a hotel/nightclub next to his castle to pay the exhorbitant 
   property taxes his castle incurs. The toothless Dracula (he has to

   is also Executive Producer, is very pretty and can't act a lick) run 
   the hotel/nightclub, as she auditions bands, dances and occasionally

   Dracula and Theodore make the trip to New York to bring Nocturna back 
   to Transylvania. Dracula hypnotizes Jugula to find Nocturna's 
   location and he then sends Theodore to retrieve her and kill Jimmy. 
   Will there be a happy ending? C'mon, this is disco! Every ending is a

   (both 1978), creates a film that's really hit-and-miss, with more 
   misses than hits, but it's not without it's charms. The film comes to 
   life whenever the late Brother Theodore (real name: Theodore 
   Gottlieb) is on-screen. For those of you not familiar with Brother 
   Theodore, he was a stream-of-consciousness street performer, who 
   always wore black and had a shaggy mop of silver-white hair. He 
   gained national prominence on David Letterman's late night show as a 
   frequent guest during the 80's &amp; 90's. His wild-eyed monologues 
   would leave Letterman and the audience in stitches and Theodore never 
   broke character, no matter how out-of-hand it became. He does the 
   same thing here, spouting lines that induce hysterics in the viewer 
   and the film suffers in the middle portion when it cuts away from him 
   and spends too much time on Nocturna's nocturnal NYC exploits 
   (including a trip to a vampire brothel). Things pick up again once 
   Brother Theodore sets foot on New York soil (Theodore was also in the 
   kung-fu/horror film <B><A HREF="gang_wars_1975.htm">GANG WARS</A></B>,

   looker and does a few eye-opening nude scenes to make you forget her 
   thespic talents. Oh, and she likes to dance! There's also a funny 
   scene where Jimmy teaches Nocturna how to smoke a joint and, while 
   she is stoned, she turns into a (badly animated) bat. Jimmy just 
   looks at the bat and says, &quot;This is some fantastic grass!&quot; 
   While this film doesn't add up to much, it gets high marks from me 
   thanks to Brother Theodore's outlandish performance. I love his death 
   speech. It goes: &quot;Death to the young! Death to the strong! Death 
   to the happy! Long live...Death!&quot; Mac Ahlbeg's sweeping 
   camerawork adds immensely to the proceedings and makes it one 
   good-looking low-budget film. This was Compass International's

   accidentally captures the notorious Death Valley Drifter serial 
   killer at his killing shed in the middle of the desert, which 
   contains the decomposing body parts of all his victims (In the 
   opening minutes, we watch as the Drifter runs over a hitchhiker with 
   his car, parking one of the car tires on the hitcher's chest and then 
   removing his tongue with a pair of shears). The Drifter, who hears 
   voices that tell him to kill, is brought to justice and dies in the 
   gas chamber, which is witnessed by Deputy McAllister, but as we know 
   from watching too many horror films, death is only the beginning and 
   retribution will be had no matter how long it takes. Thirty years 
   later, McAllister (Robert Pine; Ponch and Jon's commanding officer on 
   the TV series <B><A HREF="chips_tv_series_1977-1983.htm">CHiPs</A></B>

   to his estranged son Harris (Michael Muhney), who has just moved back

   three bank robbers who roll into town after pulling off a big heist.

    the robbers is killed when a propane tank explodes at the town's 
   only gas station during a shootout, it seems to cause an earthquake 
   where something strange happens. McAllister, Harris, new waitress 
   Maya (Mircea Monroe), town doctor Allison (Valerie Cruz) and the two 
   remaining robbers, Binky (Desmond Askew) and Alex (Stephen Martines), 
   are trapped in town, where everyone else has seemingly disappeared 
   and the entire town smells like rotting flesh. Sheriff McAllister 
   immediately recognizes the smell (it stinks just like the Drifter's 
   killing shack thirty years earlier) and it soon becomes apparent that 
   the town is in some sort of time warp (the town is surrounded on all 
   sides by an impenetrable invisible force field, making escape an 
   impossibility) and the Drifter has returned to continue his killing 
   spree. Everything that now happens in town defies logic, yet Sheriff 
   McAllister refuses to believe that the Drifter (who moves in 
   herky-jerky motions and begins dispatching people with a 
   flame-thrower and other weapons) is responsible for the killings. The 
   Sheriff finally believes when he sees the Drifter with his own eyes, 
   but as the Drifter begins thinning out the cast and things get 
   weirder and weirder (in a good way for the viewer), it will take 
   another huge explosion to return the town to normal. Who is left 
   alive and the creative explanation for what has just transpired are 
   just a couple of things I'll let the audiences discover for 
   themselves.&nbsp; Not a bad little horror film, a sequel of sorts to 
   2005's <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Reeker">REEKER</A></B> (it's more 
   of a remake than a sequel, since no one from the original film 
   appears here), director/scripter/co-producer Dave Payne (also 
   responsible for <B>REEKER</B>, as well as <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Not Like Us">NOT
    LIKE US</A></B> [1995] and <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Alien Terminator">ALIEN
    TERMINATOR</A></B> [1996]) at least tries to give the viewer 
   something different on what is obviously a very limited budget. There 
   are some legitimate scares here as well as a few gross and funny 
   sights. Since no one in town can actually die until the Drifter 
   finishes them off, there are some strange visuals on view, such as 
   when Binky hits the invisible wall while traveling full speed in his 
   car, losing the top of his head and his nose in the process. Binky, 
   not knowing how bad his injuries really are, gets out of the car and 
   starts talking to a rightfully frightened Alex, who puts a plastic 
   bag over Binky's head as they walk back to town. The entire scene, 
   including the car hitting the transparent force field, is very well 
   done and offers the audience both the gross-out gore they want mixed 
   with some unexpected humor. I also admired how Payne films the deaths 
   of the cast as a series of quickly-edited montage scenes from their 
   pasts, like we are witnessing their lives flashing before their eyes. 
   Not everything works here (some of the CGI-enhanced effects are 
   simply awful), but <B><A HREF="no_mans_land_rise_of_reeker_2008b.htm">NO
    MAN'S LAND: THE RISE OF REEKER</A></B> is different enough to keep 
   the viewer entertained throughout. Extra points go to the 
   double-twist surprise finale, which really pack a punch, both 
   viscerally and intellectually. I liked it a lot because it's not the 
   same old and tired horror clich&eacute;s that seem to be so prevalent 
   today. Some thought went into this and it shows. Also starring Ben

    OBJECTIVE</A><A NAME="Objective2007"></A> (2007) -</B> Two months 
   after the terrorist events of 9/11/2001, CIA Agent Benjamin Keynes 
   (Jonas Ball) is sent back to Afghanistan to investigate what seems to 
   be a huge radiation blip in the rugged mountains in enemy territory. 
   Thinking it may be a huge stash of Weapons of Mass Destruction&nbsp; 
   (Remember those elusive WMD's?), Keynes and a squad of 
   specially-trained soldiers land by helicopter as close to their 
   objective as they can and travel the rest of the way by foot, but it 
   is plain to see from the moment their feet hit the ground that this 
   is not going to be an ordinary mission. It's going to be surreal as 
   it gets and also just as dangerous. When Keynes and his soldiers go 
   to meet their contact in an Afghan village, the elders tell Keynes 
   that his contact has relocated to a sacred mountain; a place so holy 
   and frightening to all the villagers that even the Taliban are scared 
   to go there. After being warned by the village elders not to go there 
   (it really was good <A HREF="objective_2008b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/objective dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="280" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>advice),
    a friendly Afghan named Abdul (Chems-Eddine Zinoune) agrees to guide 
   Keynes and his squad to the sacred mountain. After traversing 
   booby-trapped roads (Keynes seems to have a second sense in locating 
   hidden land mines), they come under enemy attack at a canyon and one 
   of Keynes' soldiers is killed. The strange thing is that none of the 
   enemy casualties can be found. It was like their bodies just 
   disappeared. The soldiers want to call off the mission, but Keynes 
   orders them to push on. That night, they spy what they think are the 
   headlights of an enemy vehicle approaching them, but suddenly the 
   lights split up and fly over them, not making a sound. Abdul tells 
   them that these are called &quot;spirit lights&quot; and they have 
   occupied this territory for generations. Things get downright spooky 
   when their radio goes on the fritz and the sounds of helicopters fill 
   the air, but none can be seen in the sky. The helicopter sounds 
   suddenly stop and the next morning the body of their dead soldier 
   disappears, a stone altar containing the innards of many bodies is 
   discovered and several strange triangle-shaped doorways can be seen 
   littering the landscape. After discovering an extremely old hermit in 
   a cave who seems to be guarding something, we learn that Keynes knows 
   a lot more about this &quot;radiation&quot; (which appears as red 
   triangles on his special radiation viewer) than he is letting on to 
   his squad. After accidentally killing the hermit, things turn from 
   bad to worse when the soldiers begin to slowly lose grip on reality 
   (they fill their water canteens with sand) and then become hopelessly 
   lost (Even Abdul doesn't recognize the territory, especially the 
   triangle-like mountain in front of them). When it becomes obvious 
   that the soldiers aren't actually on a mission, they are the mission, 
   it may be too late for everyone, as an ancient evil (known by 
   Alexander The Great as the &quot;Shield Of Fire&quot;) begins killing 
   everyone. Will anyone be left to warn mankind or is something more 
   sinister going on? This is a creepy, deliberately-paced supernatural 
   horror film from director Daniel Myrick, who co-directed the cult hit <B><A HREF="blair_witch_project_1999.htm">THE
    BLAIR WITCH PROJECT</A></B> (1999; which gave everyone with a video

   (2007) and then gave us the engaging horror film <B><A HREF="solstice_2007.htm">SOLSTICE</A></B> 
   (2007; a busy year for Myrick!) . Myrick, who co-wrote the screenplay 
   with Mark A. Patton and Wesley Clark Jr. (the son of retired U.S. 
   General and Presidential candidate Wesley Clark), gives the viewer a 
   severe case of the willies, as strange phenomenon unknown to everyone 
   but Keynes (who experienced the same strange stuff before when he and 
   his CIA buddies tried to set-up a training camp in the area several 
   years earlier) begins claiming the lives of the soldiers and forces 
   Abdul to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff. The use of the barren 
   terrain of Afghanistan (actually Morocco, because filming in 
   Afghanistan during the &quot;War On Terror&quot; would just be plain 
   nuts) to portray a feeling of hopelessness and despair, not to 
   mention that it looks like some alien landscape, really works in this 
   film's favor, because who can really say what actually happens in 
   these remote regions of Earth? The mixture of UFO theories. local 
   legends and modern technologies, combined with some really good sound 
   design (the gun battles just pop and put you in the middle of the 
   action if you have a good audio set-up) and a final image before the

    FROM THE BLACK LAGOON</A></B> (1954), so one gets the sad feeling 
   that Mr. Essex was trying to relive old glories by making his own

   creating a film that is unintentionally funny in spots, deadly boring 
   for the remainder of the running time and will have you constantly 
   looking at the clock in hopes that you will be put out of your misery 
   soon. The film opens with Dr. Rick Torres (Kerwin Matthews; <B><A HREF="battle_beneath_the_earth_1968.htm">BATTLE
    BENEATH THE EARTH</A></B> - 1967) and his associate, Dr. Susan Lowry 
   (the tragic Pier Angeli; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#InFoldsFlesh">IN
    THE FOLDS OF THE FLESH</A></B> - 1970; who took her own life in 
   1971), measuring the unusually high radiation levels in the ocean 
   waters off a small Mexican fishing village. Co-worker Mort Stein 
   (Norman Fields) finds a mutated baby octopus in one of the nearby 
   lagoons, so Rick, Susan and Mort go back to the lagoon, let the baby 
   octopus go and then recapture it. I'm not sure why they do this, but 
   it seems to upset the man-sized Octaman (suit designed by Rick Baker 
   and Doug Beswick), who is hiding in the water nearby. While Rick and 
   Susan fly off to their home base in the States to report their 
   findings, Octaman attacks the base camp and kills a Mexican with its 
   suckered tentacles, rescuing another baby mutant octopus (which the 
   Mexican was about to dissect) and bringing it back to the lagoon. 
   Once at the International Ecological Institute, Rick shows the mutant 
   baby octopus to Director John Willard (Jeff Morrow; <B><A HREF="this_island_earth_1955.htm">THIS
    ISLAND EARTH</A></B> - 1955; in a quick booze-money cameo) in hopes 
   of getting more funding to study the effects of radiation on ocean 
   life (Susan's absence from this important meeting is quickly 
   explained by Rick to Director Willard that she can't be here because 
   she is at the hairdresser! Surely, for something this important, she 
   could have postponed getting her hair done for a couple more hours! 
   Or maybe she was already contemplating suicide?). Unbelievably, even 
   after seeing the mutant baby octopus, Director Willard turns down 
   Rick's request for more funding. Rick is forced to get financial 
   backing from carnival owner Johnny Caruso (Jerome Guardino), who 
   agrees to put up the money as long as he can capture any mutated 
   marine life and display them &quot;like they were King Kong!&quot;

   discover the dead body of their Mexican comrade. One of the locals 
   tells a story (in flashback) of a &quot;half-man, half-sea 
   serpent&quot; that roams the area (the flashback footage shows 
   Octaman carrying away a local woman after killing her husband by 
   striking him so hard on the head with one of its tentacles, his eye 
   pops out of its socket!). The film continues to meander along at a 
   snail's pace, as Octaman shows up every so often to kill some locals 
   and then sets its sights on Susan, while Mort and Johnny argue over 
   the benefits of saving our economy and recycling (an early-70's movie 
   theme, as ecology and recycling were just becoming popular). When 
   Octaman finally abducts Susan (it's true love), Rick must find a way 
   to save her before Octaman becomes all touchy-feely. Perhaps creating 
   a ring of fire around the creature while it is on dry land will suck 
   all the oxygen out of its system? Perhaps not. It just pisses Octaman 
   off even more and it eventually abducts Susan again, only this time 
   Rick and company shoot Octaman in a hail of gunfire and it stumbles 
   into the lagoon, hopefully to die and never appear in another film 
   ever again.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's not much to recommend her except the 
   Octaman rubber suit, but even it is overused to the point that we get 
   to notice all its flaws, including eyes and mouth that do not move 
   and the fact that it only has six tentacles (and two legs). While 
   there are dollops of blood and gore here and there (including Octaman 
   impaling one of its tentacles into the chest of a wetback), the film 
   moves slower than an Alabama high school student trying to figure out 
   a geometry exam. Poor Pier Angeli (real name: Anna Maria Pierangeli) 
   looks as if she is drunk for most of her screen time and this has to 
   be a career low for both Kerwin Matthews and Jeff Morrow. This is 
   hack filmmaking at its worst and director/screenwriter Harry Essex

   (1988) -</B> Oh, my. This is going to be special. The film opens with 
   an abusive mom flicking her cigarette ashes into the scrambled eggs 
   she is making for her troubled ten year-old son John (who hasn't 
   spoken a word since his father left him and Mom), who is a serial 
   killer in the making, as his mother verbally fucks with him for 
   drilling holes in his pet turtle. Later that day, he walks along the 
   edge of a well on a dare from the mean neighborhood kids and slips 
   and falls in, knocking him unconscious and disfiguring his face. The 
   kids run away and leave him there, except for his only friend 
   Gretchen. Ten years pass and John (Richard A. Bushwell) has spent 
   those years under heavy medication in a mental institution since the 
   police found him chowing down on the dead body of his mother. As luck 
   would have it, John escapes the institution (by stabbing a hypodermic

    of the well incident. He heads back to town to get revenge on the 
   kids (now college students) who did him wrong and to leave little 
   gifts (the &quot;offerings&quot; of the title) for his only friend 
   Gretchen (Loretta Leigh Bowman). Sheriff Chisum (G. Michael Smith) is 
   notified of John's impending arrival and fears that he may be already 
   here when he finds a half-eaten carcass of a live duck with human 
   teeth imprints on it. John kills his first victim by putting his head 
   in a vise and popping it like a zit (but only after both a chainsaw 
   and electric drill refuse to work for him!). He snaps the neck of his 
   second victim while she is sitting in her car. John starts sending 
   gifts to Gretchen, the first one seemingly harmless (it isn't) and 
   each one after that getting progressively worse. Gretchen calls 
   Sheriff Chisum (when he comes over, he says, &quot;Any more body 
   parts around here?&quot;) and warns her and her friend Kacy 
   (Elizabeth Greene) that John is on the loose. Since Gretchen's 
   parents are away in Hawaii, it sets the stage for a final showdown 
   between Gretchen and John at her parents' house, once John has killed 
   everyone who was at the well ten years earlier (he dumps their bodies 
   in the well). John offers Gretchen one final gift (Hint: It could fit 
   in a hat box.) before she and the sheriff kill the seemingly 
   indestructable John. It's at this time that John says his first word

   leaving Gretchen gifts at her door (the first being a couple of 
   pizzas topped with the cooked flesh of his first victim, which her 
   friends scarf down), but the rest of the film is basic stalk 'n'

   bloodier (most of the deaths happen off-screen), but Reynolds does 
   toss in a couple of screwy characters (like a gravedigger that hates

   to look over the crime scene, since he has seen this kind of carnage 
   several times before he retired (but never solved the crimes because 
   no one would believe his explanation of the crimes). Meanwhile, a 
   mostly-naked cannibal girl (Rachel White, whose breasts are smaller 
   than mosquito bites) roams the woods flagellating herself with a tree 
   branch and appearing at night near the home of David Halbard (Andrew 
   Elvis Miller), his wife Amy (Amy Hargreaves) and their young baby 
   (David even jokes with his wife about seeing a naked girl in the 
   woods and they have a good laugh about it!). George tells the entire 
   police force that he believes that the killers are the descendants of 
   an old lighthouse keeper who died in the 1850's and they have avoided 
   capture for all these years by keeping on the move and hiding in the 
   caves that dot the coastline, returning back to the towns where they 
   have committed their crimes after everyone has forgotten about the 
   murders. Things get heated when friend Claire (Ahna Tessler) and her 
   young son Luke (Tommy Nelson) come to visit David and Amy to get away 
   from her drunk and abusive husband Stephen (Erick Kastel), who has 
   found out where she is and is driving from Connecticut to bring them 
   back (Just to prove what a heel Stephen is, we see him pick up a 
   female hitchhiker and physically and mentally abuses her before he 
   lets her out of the car. Oh, and he's driving drunk, too.). The 
   female head of the cannibal clan (Pollyanna McIntosh) decides they 
   need a new baby for their clan, so they invade David and Amy's house 
   that night, disembowel David (it's hard to watch), kidnap Amy and 
   nearly kill Stephen, who has just arrived at the house, but Claire 
   and Luke manage to grab the baby and escape, with the cannibals hot 
   on their heels. Stephen gets stopped by George and the police, but he 
   runs into the woods because he is drunk and David had called the 
   police to tell the dispatcher about Stephen's eventual arrival (only 
   to be asked by the dispatcher if he has a gun because too much is 
   going on for the police to handle domestic disputes!). When the 
   cannibals capture Claire, kill Vic (he gets a nail shoved into his 
   eye, followed by a knife impaled through his neck and his lower jaw 
   bitten off) and seriously injure George, it is up to young Luke to 
   protect the baby (in a treehouse) and also find a way to free his mom 
   and Amy.&nbsp; I have to say that I was expecting a whole lot more 
   than what I got when I heard that Jack Ketchum actually wrote the 
   screenplay to this film, but there are just too many plot holes you 
   could drive a train through. This is nothing but an ordinary DTV 
   horror flick that offers nothing new to the cannibal genre, Sure, 
   there is plenty of graphic gore, rape and bloody deaths (including 
   the killing of children), but the depiction of the cannibal clan, who 
   dress in loincloths (Are they too stupid to wear the clothes of their 
   victims to maybe look a little bit more normal? For a cannibal clan 
   that has successfully hidden their presence for over 150 years, they 
   sure do some stupid things!) and speak in gibberish (which is 
   subtitled in English), it is so outlandish and sometimes cartoonish, 
   it ruins the effictiveness of the film. Director Andrew Van Den 
   Houten (whose first film, <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Headspace2005">HEADSPACE</A></B> 
   [2005], is much more effective than this) tries hard, especially with 
   the gore sequences, but the screenplay is weak. The film loses all 
   control when Stephen is captured by the cannibals and he helps them 
   torture Claire (!), telling the clan that &quot;she hates to be 
   bitten&quot;, so one male cannibal strips Claire naked and proceeds 
   to bite her between her legs! Stephen eventually gets his totally 
   expected comeuppance (he has the top of his head lopped off and his 
   brains eaten), but the damage is already done. If it's only gore you 
   want, by all means <B><A HREF="offspring_2009b.htm">OFFSPRING</A></B> 
   is for you; but if you want a coherent storyline and characters to 
   care about, look somewhere else. Maybe all those people who call Jack 
   Ketchum a &quot;hack&quot; who only cares about blood and gore in his 
   novels are right (I can't say because I haven't read any of his 
   novels, but I am basing my opinion based solely on this film). Also 
   starring Spencer List, Leigh Shannon, Stephen Grey and Taylor John 
   Piedmonte. A Ghost House Underground DVD Release. <B>Rated R</B>, but 
   this is hard-R territory. NOTE: If you have seen this film on the 
   cable channel CHILLER, you may be surprised how much of the gore they 
   show, although they do shorten some of the more gory scenes 
   (especially Claire's death) and blur out the breasts of Rachel White 
   and other women, but at least they don't cut the scenes completely. 
   Still, you should grab the DVD for the full experience if you are a gorehound.</FONT></FONT></P>

   served papers that his family's coconut oil farm is being foreclosed 
   by the evil Mr. Yang, a fight breaks out and Fu Sin's father kills 
   one of Mr. Yang's men. He is arrested and sentenced to be executed. 
   The crippled Ah Yung (Li Hsiu-Hsien; a.k.a. &quot;Danny Lee), the 
   elderly Mr. Chen's nephew, visits Mr. Chen minutes before his 
   execution. Ah Yung, who walks with two canes and leg braces after 
   contracting polio as a kid, is asked by Mr. Chen to look after his 
   daughter, Little Yue (Lily Li), and in return he gives Ah Yung a 
   magic spell (it's tattooed on Mr. Chen's back) that will somehow help 
   Ah Yung. The spell comes with a warning, though: &quot;You can't use 
   it with a wrong intent...or you will die in a very, very bad 
   way!&quot;. Ah Yung makes a tracing of the spell on a piece of paper 
   just before Mr. Chen is executed. He returns to his job at a law 
   firm, where he is abused and berated constantly. On his off time he 
   tends to the needs of Little Yue (who isn't so little) and Ah Yung 
   falls in love with her, but his crippled body seems to be a major 
   stumbling block. He remembers the spell and starts following the

   over. Check. Before you know it, the hole fills-up with a bubbling 
   black oil, turning Ah Yung into a walking slimy black blob with two 
   glowing eyes and an exposed beating heart in the middle of his chest, 
   the Oily Maniac! The first thing OM does is save Little Yue from 
   being raped by two of Mr. Yang's thugs. OM is able to transform 
   himself into an oil slick and slides under Little Yue's door, where 
   he beats one rapist to a bloody pulp (the other thug gets away to 
   report to his unbelieving boss what he just saw) and then returns 
   home to transform back to his crippled self. In court, another rapist 
   is brought to trial (where he testifies that the female victim was 
   actually the rapist!) and after Ah Yung sees how the court was played 
   for a fool by his obnoxious boss (the rapist was actually innocent 
   and the woman his boss was representing was just looking for a big 
   payday) and, later, witnessing Little Yue make love to another 
   non-crippled man, he decides to use his new power to teach women a 
   lesson. He grabs a handy diesel pump at a gas station, sprays 
   himself, turns into the Oily Maniac (!) and goes after the woman at 
   the trial. He gets into her house by traveling through her bathtub 
   faucet (!), kills her and her lover is blamed for the crime. As Ah 
   Yung becomes more disillusioned with his job and women in general, he 
   steps up his transformations and retributions, but when Little Yue 
   commits suicide after being raped by one of Mr. Yang's men (set up by 
   her new boyfriend to quicken the sale of her father's coconut oil 
   farm), Ah Yung turns into a vigilante and starts killing people left 
   and right, especially when he finds out that his boss is in cahoots 
   with Mr. Yang. He should have listened to his late Uncle when he 
   mentioned wrong intent and dying in a very, very bad way. Say, isn't

    MAGIC</A></B> (using many of the same personnel), seems to realize 
   how ridiculous the entire premise is, therefore he shows as much 
   nudity as possible (including a very ugly botched boob job) and makes 
   each proceeding attack by the Oily Maniac (a truly bizarre creation) 
   more outrageous than the last. My favorite has to be the attack by OM 
   on a female plastic surgeon (who we see surgically altering a 
   prostitute so she a virgin again [a re-virgination!]) and her 
   all-female staff. It will have you howling with laughter as well as 
   amazement, when he makes his sudden appearance during surgery and 
   repeatedly stomps on the surgeon's head until only a pool of oil and 
   blood are left. The script, by Tsai Lan, is a rather harsh indictment 
   of the legal profession and women in general, as Ah Yung's slimy 
   boss, Mr. Hu, demands 90% of court awards from his clients (who are 
   usually conniving women) and treats Ah Yung like dog shit on the 
   bottom of his shoe. The mostly all-female staff in Mr. Hu's office 
   also treat Ah Yung like crap (except for one understanding girl), so 
   we can begin to understand his hatred of women. Ho Meng Hua uses 
   animation for some of the transformation scenes (crude, but eerily 
   effective) and reverse camera shots (like those used on <B><A HREF="six_million_dollar_man_tv_series.htm">THE

    37</A><A NAME="Old372015"></A> (2015) -</B> This is a nice 
   old-fashioned horror film that should please fans. About 20 years 
   ago, Jimmy (Kenneth Simmons),a fake psychotic paramedic, hears a call 
   on the police radio of an accident on the road and heads out there in 
   a beat up ambulance (The &quot;Old 37&quot; of the title) with his

   (with a shit-eating grin on his face). Cut to the Present day, where 
   Jordan (Jake Robinson) and Mary (Sascha Knopf) are having sex while 
   Jordan is driving (Is sex while driving against the law?) and have 
   the inevitable accident. Mary calls for help on her cell phone and 
   two fake paramedics, Darryl (Bill Moseley;<B><A HREF="texas_chainsaw_3d_2012.htm">TEXAS

    pick up where Daddy Jimmy left off and attack Mary and the slit 
   Jordan's throat, the blood spraying on a screaming Mary's face. We 
   then see Angel (Brandi Cyrus, the older maternal half-sister of Miley 
   Cyrus) telling Jason (Maxwell Zagorski) that she wants to play 
   &quot;Ride The Monster&quot; (No, it's nothing sexual!), a feat where 
   she has two feet on two cars driving at the same speed while she 
   stands up with her legs spread open and cheers. Unfortunately she falls<A HREF="old_37_2015.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/old 37 poster10 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="162" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   and is severely injured. Jason calls 911 and a real Paramedic shows 
   up, but they give the paramedic a false statement on how Angel got 
   her injuries. When they ask the paramedic why it took him so long to 
   get to them, he says. &quot;We only have one ambulance covering 300 
   square miles.&quot; (a lame attempt to legitimize the killer 
   paramedics, even though this was filmed in Long Island, New York.) 
   Angel eventually dies in the hospital. Jason and Amy (Caitlin Harris) 
   secretly like each other, even though Amy wants breast augmentation 
   surgery because she is sick and tired of the popular girls in school 
   making fun of her flat chest. She has no idea that Jason was involved 
   with the death of her friend Angel. Jason watches one of his friends 
   hitting an old woman with his car (the old woman is Jon Roy and 
   Darryl's mother) and they take off without calling the police because 
   the Angel case is getting plenty of police attention, especially by 
   Amy's divorced father Detective Higgins (Robert T. Bogue). Another 
   couple of teens, Rachel (Margaret Keane Williams) and Tim (Ben 
   Schneider) are attacked by Darryl and Jon Roy while in their car and 
   Darryl is stabbed in the arm (later we see him pouring lye on the 
   wound), while Jon Roy grabs Tim and slices his neck open until the 
   blood sprays out&nbsp; (a great practical effect) This film is also 
   full of flashbacks that show how Daddy abused Darryl and Jon Roy 
   (some would say there are too many flashbacks). While on Angel's 
   case, Detective Higgins decides to check out Jimmy's Scrap Yard, 
   which is run by Darryl. To keep the detective from noticing Rachel 
   and Tim's blood dripping from the trunk of a car, Darryl introduces 
   him to Jon Roy (Who is always wearing a mask that covers his mouth 
   (More flashbacks show us why. As children, Darryl would always pick 
   on Jon Roy and one day he takes a hammer and chisel to Jon Roy's 
   mouth, sending him to the hospital). Long story short, more kids 
   disappear&nbsp; and both Jason and Amy become trapped in Jimmy's 
   Scrap Yard. Jason is about to get a power drill lobotomy for not 
   reporting Darryl's mother getting hit by a car (she died), but Darryl 
   stops before he does it. (No reason is given). Amy finds friend 
   Brooke (Olivia Alexander) chained to a table, her face all disfigured 
   (earlier in the film we see Darryl pour a can of gas into Brooke's 
   mouth and face and then sets her on fire, but she is somehow still 
   alive (she eventually dies). Darryl then stabs and kills a nosey 
   Detective Higgins. Then, in a turn no one saw coming, Jon Roy grabs 
   Darryl and shoves his face in the spinning blade of some scrap yard 
   machine for all the bad things he did and said to him over the years, 
   turning Darryl's face into raw chuck. (When Detective Higgins first 
   enters the scrap yard, Darryl makes Jon Roy cackle like a chicken, 
   but he never says a word throughout the entire film.) Before 
   Detective Higgins entered the scrap yard he called for some backup 
   and Officer Hung (David Shih) arrives at the scene to save Jason and 
   a busty Amy (whose recovery period after her breast augmentation 
   operation is phenominal!) after almost running them over, but the 
   film ends with a masked Jon Roy driving Old 37 directly into the 
   trio.&nbsp; This Internet crowdfunded film is filled with plenty of 
   flashbacks to give Darryl and Jon Roy a back history. Director 
   Christian Winters (No other information is available on him) decided 
   to take the pseudonym &quot;Alan Smithee&quot; when he lost creative 
   control of the film. (Lots of directors and writers do the same 
   thing, such as Kevin Yagher&nbsp; on <B><A HREF="hellraiser_bloodline_1996.htm">HELLRAISER:
    BLOODLINE</A> </B>- 1996.) The screenplay, by Joe Landes and Paul 
   Travers (the first screenplay for both, but it is based on a 
   nightmare Travers had) has enough holes in it to drive an ambulance 
   through (Like why haven't the real parametics never noticed a 911 
   call that doesn't exist? They couldn't possibly think after all these 
   years that they were all crank calls; and what about the parents 
   never seeing their kid's or relative's dead bodies? It seems that 
   only Detective Higgins had the brains to investigate.) The acting is 
   better than normal for a DTV film of this type (Most of the young 
   cast hardly acted before) and besides one scene of obvious CGI blood, 
   all the special effects are practical. I also find it funny that Kane 
   Hodder, who has played Jason Voorhees<B> </B>in four <B><A HREF="jason_x_2001.htm">FRIDAY
    THE 13TH</A></B> films would battle a guy name Jason in this film. 
   (Hodder's adult son has said this is the favorite film his father has 
   done.) I have seen a lot worse films than <B><A HREF="old_37_2015b.htm">OLD
    37</A></B>. It is entertaining, moves fast and can be quite gory at 
   times. Whatever you do, don't watch the version shown on Chiller, 
   because it optically blurs out some nudity and gore (it also adds 
   some footage like the sight of Jon Roy with his mask off, which 
   replaces the scene of him slicing Tim's neck and Darryl give Daddy 
   the power drill lobotomy in a flashback). That is the reason we watch

    who claimed his supernatural powers were real. His funeral brings 
   out his estranged daughter, Olivia (Melissa Newman), and, at the 
   mausoleum (where his body is interred), she begins to have strange 
   visions.&nbsp; When Olivia and her boyfriend, Allan (Adam West), 
   return home, they are greeted at the door by reporter Samuel 
   Dockstader (Donald Hotton), an old friend of her father's, who has 
   quite a story to tell her. It seems Karl was a &quot;psychic 
   vampire&quot;, a person who was able to drain the 
   &quot;bio-energy&quot; (a force every living thing possesses that is 
   viewable only by Kirlian Photography) from everyone he was near. He 
   was able to store that energy within his own body and use it to 
   perform amazing feats of telekinesis, or moving objects with his 
   mind. Dockstader tells Olivia that he lost contact with her father 
   when he started picking up hitch-hikers and draining them of their 
   energy. He fears that her father wanted to die, so he could use his 
   powers sans his human body. Allan thinks the story is nothing but 
   nonsense, but Olivia is sure that it is true. College girl Julie (Meg 
   Tilly) is being initiated into a sorority known simply as &quot;The 
   Sisters&quot; by being locked in a mausoleum for the night. You 
   guessed it. The mausoleum she is trapped in contains the body of Karl 
   Raymar. Julie's new boyfriend, Steve (David Mason Daniels), is highly 
   suspicious of the initiation because his ex-girlfriend, Carol (Robin 
   Evans), is the leader of The Sisters (which is really only three 
   girls) and he is sure that Carol has no intention of letting Julie 
   join the sorority (Carol practically admits it when she hits on Steve 
   when Julie is in the next room). Steve has no idea where Julie is and 
   she can really use his help because Karl Raymar's powers are 
   beginning to get deadly in the mausoleum. When Carol and one of her 
   Sisters come back to the mausoleum to scare Julie (after drugging her 
   with Demerol!), they'll wish thay didn't, as Raymar unleashes his 
   power and reanimates a bunch of dead bodies. As Steve comes to save 
   the day, Olivia learns that she may have inherited some of her 
   father's powers and she rushes to the mausoleum to put her father's 
   soul to rest. The finale is a psychic battle of good vs. evil, as the 
   dead rise from their coffins and a daughter uses her new powers to 
   send her father to a proper final reward.&nbsp; This atmospheric little<A HREF="entity_force_1982.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/entity force aka one dark night british vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="122" HEIGHT="196" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   chiller is far-fetched, but effective and it is all achieved with a 
   minimum of blood and gore and a maximum of mood. From the opening 
   shot of four white coroner vans pulling-up in unison to the front of 
   Raymar's apartment building to collect the bodies, to the spookie 
   mausoleum-at-night setting (which instantly brings to mind visions of <B><A HREF="phantasm_1979.htm">PHANTASM</A></B>

   any means. It's an intelligent (though extremely unlikely) foray into 
   things that go bump in the night. This film actually tries to give 
   you an explanation why these thing go &quot;bump&quot;. The whole 
   idea of a &quot;psychic vampire&quot; may seem ridiculous, but 
   McLoughlin pulls it off here, thanks to the goosebump-inducing 
   location work, the eerie electronic music score (and sound effects) 
   and some great makeup effects courtesy of the Burman Studios. The 
   scene where Raymar unleashes his power in the mausoleum, when the 
   caskets of the dead break through their enclosures, open up and the 
   corpses attack Carol and Kitty (Leslie Speights), killing them 
   (mainly from fright), and then attack Julie and Steve, is the 
   definition of shit-your-pants scary. This isn't a classic by any 
   means, but it is an effective little horror film with several good 
   scares done on a purely emotional level. That's strange for a horror 
   film made during this time period. There's minimal gore (but the 
   corpses in the final are juicy), no nudity and very little blood, but

   dastardly plans for the teens, who begin to have visions of monks in 
   robes and little girls with snake tongues. Miles from civilization 
   and with no transportation to get away, the teens have nowhere to 
   turn. When the uncle of one of Marquez Academy's full-time students 
   comes to visit his niece and finds out that she is dead, he becomes 
   suspicious of the Academy, especially when people from town 
   continually ask him, &quot;Are you one of them?&quot; There's also a 
   mysterious symbol that shows up just before someone is about to get 
   killed. Somehow (but don't ask me how), all this ties into how one of 
   the teens resembles a long-dead woman named Elizabeth, which really 
   worries evil headmaster Santiago (Osman Soykut). As the teens become 
   more and more suspicious, one gets showered with (CGI) blood while 
   standing outside and another discovers an auto graveyard hidden 
   behind the Academy (and gets graphically stabbed with a bayonette for 
   his troubles). The Uncle (Richard Anthony Crenna, son of the late 
   actor Richard Crenna) begins piecing clues together about the 
   Academy, but everyone he talks to ends up dead (one guy is forced 
   into a woodchipper). As the Uncle gets closer to the ultimate truth, 
   more people continue to die, others have visions of Elizabeth and 
   there's a finale that involves woodoo (Not voodoo. Woodoo is black 
   voodoo according to this film.) and more sacrifices. Be prepared for 
   the standard &quot;twist&quot; ending that all screenwriters (here 
   it's David Ciesielski) use when they can't come up with a proper 
   conclusion.&nbsp; This is pretty standard DTV stuff. Toss a bunch of 
   unknown young actors into a perilous situation, throw in some bloody 
   deaths (including a nasty scalpel to the eye) and add a hint of the 
   supernatural and hope the audience doesn't notice how absurd the 
   whole story is. The fact that most of the teens are pretty bad actors 
   and the screenplay has enough holes to strain spaghetti, doesn't make 
   this an easy film to sit through. The overwrought music soundtrack, 
   which relies too much on heavy chants and choir singing, is also a

    ORACLE</A><A NAME="Oracle1985"></A> (1985) -</B> After directing 
   nothing but hardcore porn films for fifteen years, in 1985, Roberta 
   Findlay began making a series of six horror and exploitation films 
   with producer/musician Walter E. Sear. This was the first of those 
   films. The next five were <A HREF="exploitation.htm#Tenement"><B>TENEMENT:
    GAME OF SURVIVAL</B></A> (1985); <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BloodSisters">BLOOD
    SISTERS</A></B> (1987); <B><A HREF="#Lurkers1987">LURKERS</A></B>

   and the rarely-seen <B><A HREF="banned_1989.htm">BANNED</A></B> 
   (1989). Then, she just stopped making films and still lives in New 
   York City to this day, thick Brooklyn accent and all. She really 
   could do anything when it came to making films. She was an 
   accomplished director, cimematographer and editor (she did all three 
   on these six final films) and before that, she also acted (as 
   &quot;Anna Riva&quot;) in a series of sexploitation films in the 
   60's, usually with her late husband Michael Findlay (see my review of <B><A HREF="#Lurkers1987">LURKERS</A></B> 
   and <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Snuff">SNUFF</A></B> for more on 
   him). She made some classy porn films, but her sudden turn to horror 
   was quite puzzling, to say the least. Most of these six films were 
   run-of-the-mill potboilers, but this film and <B>TENEMENT</B> are her 
   best efforts out of the six. As a matter of fact, <B><A HREF="oracle_1985b.htm">THE
    ORACLE</A></B> has a quite complex storyline (screenplay by R. Allen 
   Leider; who usually wrote porn films, some for Findlay, and appears 
   here in a small role using the pseudonym &quot;Lee-Allen 
   Richardson&quot;) and, if I didn't know better, I would think that 
   director Kevin S. Tenney saw this film and got the idea of making the 
   similar-themed <B><A HREF="witchboard_1986.htm">WITCHBOARD</A></B> 
   the following year (they are similar in some ways; totally different 
   in others). That's not to say that Roberta Findlay invented the Ouija 
   Board as an object in horror films, because it has been a major trope 
   in them for many, many years before her film, but she managed to put 
   a unique spin on it. The film open with old hag Medium, Mrs. 
   Malatesta (Irma St.<A HREF="oracle_1985b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/oracle poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="176" HEIGHT="266" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Paule), using an unusual-looking planchette (shaped like a human hand 
   and holding a feathered pen) as it writes a message from the spirit 
   world. It only writes one word: &quot;Murder&quot;. The planchette 
   than begins to move on its own, while Mrs. Malatesta says to the 
   spirit, &quot;No! I can't help you!&quot; and then we see her Tarot 
   Cards burning on her table. We watch building super Pappas (Chris 
   Maria De Koron) packing up Mrs. Malatesta's things and moving them 
   out of her apartment, including putting the magic box containing the 
   planchette in a cedar chest, and moving it to the basement. New 
   tenant Jennifer (Caroline Capers Powers, in her only film), who has 
   moved into Mrs. Malatesta's apartment with her husband Ray (Roger 
   Neil), goes to the basement to do some laundry when she sees a green 
   light emitting from the cedar chest, which is slightly open. She 
   opens the chest out of curiosity and is instantly drawn to the magic 
   box. The Spanish Pappas appears and tells Jennifer about how the box 
   is used, by telling her, &quot;How do you say? To speak to the 
   dead&quot; and assures her it is no joke, because Mrs. Malatesta 
   showed him many times how it was used. He opens the box to give 
   Jennifer a demonstration and tells her that Mrs. Malatesta used it 
   many times to talk to the spirits of the dead, but one day she just 
   up and disappeared, never to be seen again. Pappas gives Jennifer the 
   magic box as a Christmas present (she thinks it will make a great 
   &quot;conversation piece&quot;) and Jennifer invites him to her and 
   Ray's Christmas party and dinner in their apartment. We then see some 
   Mid-80's footage of Times Square, where a hooker is standing in front 
   of a sign of a peep show that says &quot;Where's The Beef?&quot; She 
   makes a date with a fat man (who keeps his face hidden from the 
   camera) and takes him to her motel room, only to discover that the 
   man is actually a female transvestite (a woman who dresses as a man) 
   named Farkas (Pam La Testa) and she's in a murdering mood (The hooker 
   unzips Farkas' pants and discovers there isn't any beef at all!). 
   Farkas handcuffs the hooker's hands behind her back and begins to 
   stab her repeatedly with a switchblade until the motel room's walls 
   are literally covered with her blood. Farkas cleans her switchblade 
   off in the bathroom. leaves some money on the sink and exits the 
   motel room after saying &quot;Merry Christmas!&quot; to the hooker's 
   corpse, who's bloody body is spread-eagle on the bed (all the while, 
   an instrumental version of &quot;Silent Night&quot; is playing on a 
   radio). How does this connect to Jennifer and the magic box? Be 
   patient, dear reader. Be patient. Pappas shows up at Jennifer's 
   Christmas party, where it is just him, Jennifer, Ray, Cindy (Stacey 
   Graves) and her husband Ben (G. Gordon Cronce). Pappas has one drink 
   and leaves the apartment quickly, not even staying for dinner, 
   because the apartment somehow creeps him out. Jennifer and her 
   friends have a nice Christmas dinner, while Farkas walks into a diner 
   and orders the &quot;Christmas Special&quot; and a beer (When Farkas 
   asks if the beer is imported, the wise-ass, gum-chewing waitress 
   says, &quot;Yeah, it's imported from Milwaukee!&quot;). A pay phone 
   rings in the diner and Farkas knows it is for her, getting up to 
   answer it and saying something about the person on the other end 
   owing her money (The same waitress says to Farkas, &quot;What is 
   this, your own private office?). At the same time, Jennifer pulls out 
   the magic box and thinks it will all be fun if the four of them have 
   a seance (Is that ever a really good idea in a horror film?). The 
   planchette moves when all four of them put their fingers in it and it 
   writes out&nbsp; &quot;horny&quot;, something Ben purposely writes as 
   a joke (Really, is joking around with a Ouiji Board a good idea in a 
   horror film?). Farkas leaves the diner (after leaving a 40&#162; 
   tip!) while jennifer uses the planchette by herself and it spell out 
   &quot;help me&quot;. Ray accuses his wife of embarassing him by 
   performing such a tacky trick in frony of their good friends and, 
   later on, when they are in bed, Ray wants sex, but Jennifer turns her 
   back on him for not believing that it wasn't a trick. That night, 
   Jennifer sees a green light coming from the living room and gets out 
   of bed to investigate, only to see the planchette moving by itself 
   and leaving her another message (Which we can't make out at the 
   moment. Believe me, I tried by freeze-framing the DVD, but the 
   handwriting is so lousy, I couldn't make it out!). Jennifer picks up 
   the piece of paper with the message and the green light disappears. 
   Ben appears in the living room and when Jennifer tells him what she 
   just saw, he says he is getting rid of the magic box in the morning. 
   The next morning, Jennifer gives the message to her friend Cindy at 
   her dress shop&nbsp; and we learn what is written on the paper&quot; 
   William Graham&nbsp; 676-3334.&quot; The number on the piece of paper 
   is obviously a phone number, so Cindy calls it and a woman answers 
   and identifies herself as Dorothy Graham (Victoria Dryden), who 
   informs Cindy that her husband William committed suicide three weeks 
   ago. We then see Dorothy talking to her dead husband's plant manager, 
   Tom Varney (Dan Lutzky), about the phone call she just received and 
   Tom doesn't look too pleased. Now, a good detective will be able to 
   fit all the pieces of the puzzle together to figure out how 
   everything that has happened so far is connected, but I'll supply 
   even more information. Jennifer throws the magic box in the trash, 
   but everything in her living room begins to move or fly through the 
   air. We then see the planchette write a simple note: &quot;No&quot;. 
   Ray comes home and sees all the destruction, grabs the magic box and 
   goes to throw it in the incinerator, but Pappas says he will do it, 
   only for him to try and use the planchette to give him tomorrow's 
   winning lottery numbers! When the planchette doesn't move, he spits 
   on the box, but he doesn't see a slimy green octopus-like creature 
   crawl out of the box and climb up the inside of his pants leg. Pappas 
   suddenly sees tiny little sharped-tooth creatures all over his body 
   (it's actually all in his mind, as he is halucinating), so he starts 
   stabbing the creatures (actually just stabbing himself) and finally 
   ends his life when he imagines a creature is covering one of his 
   eyes, stabbing himself deeply in his eye (it's a bloody sequence). 
   The magic box won't leave Jennifer alone, as it suddenly appears in 
   her living room and she begins to have halucinations, too, like a 
   clawed creature clawing through her shower curtain and then seeing a 
   standing Pappas in the elevator with the knife still planted firmly 
   in his eye. Ben does some research on William Graham for Cindy, where 
   he tells her the method of William Graham's death: He ran a hose from 
   the tailpipe of his car into the interior of the vehicle and died of 
   carbon monoxide poisoning. Jennifer has a vision of Tom Varney and 
   Farkas knocking out William Graham and placing his body inside the 
   suicide car, basically murdering him. She goes to Graham's wife 
   Dorothy with her suspicions and brings along the notes the planchette 
   wrote to her, but Tom overhears their conversation and hires Farkas 
   to kill Jennifer. Farkas disguises herself as a maid at a New Years 
   Eve party at Cindy and Ben's apartment and almost throws <A HREF="oracle_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/oracle vhs front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Jennifer
    over the railing of the terrace, but a drunk interrupts and hits on 
   the obese Farkas. At the same party, Farkas tries to kill Jennifer 
   again in the kitchen, but Jennifer throws a hot pot of coffee in her 
   face and knocks her out with a frying pan to the head. Ray is tired 
   of Jennifer seemingly making up stories and worries that she may be 
   going crazy, so he sends her to a female psychiatrist, Dr. Ryker 
   (Ethel Mark). While Jennifer is having her head shrunk, Ray goes home 
   and sees the magic box on the coffee table in the living room. He 
   takes the box and goes to throw it in the incinerator's slot, but a 
   pair of sharp creature claws come out of the slot and rips Ray's head 
   off (a pretty decent effect). After hearing Jennifer's story, Dr. 
   Ryker has Jennifer committed to an institution for 72 hours of 
   observation. Tom goes to the institution to kill Jennifer, but the 
   shriveled-skin skull of William Graham flies through the air and 
   crashes through a window, killing Tom with shards of glass that 
   impale his face and body (a really creepy scene). Jennifer escapes 
   the institution (a little too easily for my taste) and at the same 
   time Dr. Ryker goes to Jennifer's apartment and is killed by the 
   magic box (we are never shown how). We then find out that Dorothy was 
   also part of her husband's murder, as she and Farkas kidnap Jennifer 
   (In a big goof, we see people walking down the opposite side of the 
   street, not noticing Jennifer's screams or Farkas and Dorothy 
   manhandling [womanhandling?] her.), but Jennifer escapes and Farkas 
   dies when she swings an axe at Jennifer and misses, hitting a drum of 
   toxic waste instead. It sprays all over Farkas' face and body and we 
   watch as she dissolves into a puddle of bloody goo (the effects in 
   this film, by an uncredited Dean Mercil, his first film, are above 
   average for such a low-budget affair). The shriveled corpse of 
   William Graham forces his wife into the same car he died in and 
   Dorothy is killed by carbon monoxide as the garage door closes. The 
   next time we see Jennifer, she is sitting at a table in her 
   apartment, with the planchette and some Tarot Cards on the table. She 
   has become the new Mrs. Malatesta.&nbsp; This is probably the 
   bloodiest and most special effects-laden of Roberta Findlay's last 
   six films. She takes a basic &quot;murder your husband for his 
   money&quot; scenario and turns it into a rather atmospheric and 
   bloody supernatural tale, full of strange people (the female 
   transvestite was a stroke of genius) and bloody deaths, that keeps 
   you guessing the connection for the first two-thirds of the film. 
   It's apparent while watching this film that Roberta Findlay was still 
   interested in filmmaking, but as the rest of her last five made-for-home-video
    films progressed, it was apparent that she was losing interest more 
   and more and just phoning-in her directorial chores by the time <B>PRIME
    EVIL</B> was made (I still haven't been able to get my hands on her 
   last film, <B><A HREF="banned_1989.htm">BANNED</A></B> [1989], so I 
   really can't comment on it.). Caroline Capers Powers is quite good 
   here as Jennifer&nbsp; and I was surprised to learn that this was her 
   only film. She could have become a very good actress in genre films. <B><A HREF="oracle_1985b.htm">THE
    ORACLE</A></B> proved to me that Roberta Findlay still had talent to 
   make interesting, non-porn films and I hope one day she decides to 
   get behind the camera again. Enough time has passed to give her a 
   long rest and recharge her batteries. The DVD, released by Shriek 
   Show in 2004, has a commentary track and an on-screen interview with 
   Ms. Findlay and she is absolutely hilarious with some of the stories 
   she tells about making this film and her career in general. Once you 
   hear her voice, you will never forget it. Originally released on VHS 
   by <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#U.S.A.HomeVideo">U.S.A. 
   Home Video</A>. The DVD is fullscreen, so some enterprising boutique 
   DVD company should release a widescreen version of this film. Filmed, 
   just like Findlay's last five films, in and around New York City.

   (Peggy Feury) moves into the family mansion to take care of him. From 
   the outset, it is apparent that she is a strict disciplinarian, which<A HREF="orphan_1977c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/orphan.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="119" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   doesn't sit well with Mark. She tells him when he can go to the 
   bathroom, whom he can or cannot play with, badmouths his father and 
   generally makes his life a living hell. The mental abuse begins to 
   have an effect on David. He builds a shrine in the backyard chicken 
   coop and fills it with family photographs and African artifacts that 
   his father had collected from his numerous trips to that continent. 
   At the center of the shrine stands a stuffed chimp who David thinks 
   is inhabited by his father's spirit. When Aunt Martha accidently 
   kills David's pet dog and then ties him to his bed, he becomes 
   mentally unstable and resorts to murder. He stabs the&nbsp; 
   housekeeper, Mary (Eleanor Stewart), after he overhears that she is 
   leaving and not taking him with her as she promised. He shoots Aunt 
   Martha with an elephant gun after she invades his shrine (he imagines 
   that the stuffed chimp has come alive and is attacking her). The film 
   ends with David eating a piece of toast, something Aunt Martha would 
   never let him have. Director John Ballard spices up the proceedings 
   with some arty camera moves and unusual visuals. Particularly 
   interesting is David's imagined trip to a boarding school, where Aunt 
   Martha threatens to send him. He sees it as a dirty, decrepit place, 
   where the paint is peeling and filthy, sickly children are either 
   tied to their beds or living in their own waste. His guided tour is a 
   journey through a sick mind. The acting is uniformly good, especially 
   Mark Owens and Afolabi Ajayi as an African man who befriends David 
   before being banished by Aunt Martha for being a &quot;bad 
   influence&quot;. There's not much blood, no nudity and the story 
   unfolds rather leisurely, but this film satisfies on a much more 
   cerebral level than most other horror films. Therefore, I would 
   recommend it.

   immediately, his Bible catches on fire, he sees visions of owls and 
   bats and one of the nuns shows signs of the stigmata (bleeding of the 
   hands and feet, mimicking Christ crucified on the cross), so Father 
   Inardo begins the rites of exorcism to rid the convent of evil, but

   the human heart. The church sends him to the convent to investigate 
   the murders, where he acts more like Sherlock Holmes than a Catholic 
   priest. He uncovers a history of abuse and madness in the convent, 
   which dates back to the mysterious death of the convent's first 
   Mother Superior many years ago. A stubborn Father Inardo, who refuses 
   to believe in Father Valerio's new methods (which includes 
   videotaping his exploits), sneaks back into the convent to perform an 
   old-fashioned exorcism and pays for it with his life when a fireplace 
   spews out it's flames and sets him on fire. As things get stranger 
   and deadlier at the convent, Father Valerio still refuses to believe 
   anything supernatural is going on. He's wrong, of course, because 
   Mother Vincenza is hiding a deadly secret in the attic: Her horribly 
   burned telekinetic daughter, who was quite possibly the result of a 
   rape by old Scratch himself. Maybe now Father Valerio will believe in 
   the supernatural. Oops, too late! Mother Vincenza drives him

   many of the scenes without the benefit of any artificial light, 
   making the viewer squint frequently trying to make heads or tails of 
   what the hell is going on during the gore scenes. The script, by 
   Claudio Fragasso (the director of <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Monster Dog">MONSTER

   While the final denouement leads us to believe that all the deaths 
   committed at the convent were by human hands (albeit with telekinetic 
   abilities), it's frankly hard to believe, because some of the deaths,

   human means. Mattei does try to keep our minds off the absurdity of 
   the plot by tossing in some gore (several bloody stabbings and a baby 
   being thrown into a pot of boiling water) and the unfortunate scene 
   of a live chicken having it's head chopped-off (the Italians have no 
   shame when it comes to showing real-life animal violence), but the 
   film is so static and uninvolving, it's hard to comprehend just what 
   type of audience Mattei had in mind when he made this. It starts off

    OUTING</A><A NAME="Outing1986"></A> (1986) -</B> Typical mid-80's 
   horror film. This one is a regional Houston, Texas-lensed tale about 
   a murderous genie (This film is also known as <B><A HREF="lamp_1986.htm">THE
    LAMP</A></B>). It opens with a trio of thieves, led by Harley (Hank 
   Amico), as they drive to the house of an elderly Arab woman 
   (associate producer Deborah Winters under heavy old-age makeup), who 
   is supposed to have a fortune in money hidden somewhere in the house 
   (Harley use to deliver groceries to her and swears she is &quot;filthy
    with it&quot;). Harley and his crew break into the house in the 
   middle of a fog-shrouded night and member Faylene (Michelle Watkins) 
   wonders why all the lights are on (Harley tells her it's because she 
   can afford it, since she's got &quot;piles&quot; of money). After 
   finding no money downstairs, the trio, which also includes Max (Brian 
   Floores), head upstairs and wake up the old lady, demanding to know 
   where the money is hidden. When she refuses to tell them, Harley 
   finds a chest hidden behind the bedroom wall and thinks he's hit pay 
   dirt. When the old lady tries to stop him from opening the chest 
   (there's an ancient Arabian-style oil lamp inside), Harley kills her 
   with an axe and a ruby bracelet magically falls off her wrist. Harley 
   tries to open the lamp wh<A HREF="outing_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/outing vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="318" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ile
    Faylene and Max ransack the house. When Harley can't open the lamp, 
   he follows Faylene's joking advice and rubs it (&quot;That's what 
   they use to do in all them old movies.&quot;). Uh-oh, big mistake. 
   The tip of the lamp, a small hand holding a ruby, begins to turn on 
   its own and an unseen force escapes from the opening (represented by 
   neon green opticals), enters the old lady's dead body (she still has 
   the axe planted in her forehead!) and pulls down on Harley until his 
   head is impaled on the other edge of the axe. The force then leaves 
   the old woman's body and cuts Max in two at his torso while he's 
   taking a dip in the pool. Finally, the unseen force chases a topless 
   Faylene through the house and hangs her in the old lady's bedroom, as 
   all the lights in the house go out. The next morning, police and 
   ambulances show up at the house to cart the bodies away, while 
   Detective Adams (Blue Deckert) and Detective Charles 
   (producer/screenwriter Warren Chaney) search the house, find the lamp 
   and put the small hand holding the ruby back on the lamp. Some items 
   in the house, including the lamp and the ruby bracelet, are donated 
   to the Museum Of Natural Science, where curators Dr. Wallace (James 
   Huston) and Dr. Bressling (Danny D. Daniels) take extensive 
   photographs of the lamp because &quot;it looks valuable.&quot; Enter 
   Dr. Wallace's precocious teen daughter Alex (Andra St. Ivanyi), who 
   is upset with her father since he is never at home and says to him, 
   &quot;Sometimes I wish you were dead!&quot;, which she immediately 
   apologizes for, but since she made this &quot;wish&quot; in front of 
   the lamp, an apology may not be good enough. While Dad and Dr. 
   Bressling are in another room, Alex tries on the ruby bracelet and 
   then discovers she cannot remove it, so she hides it from her father 
   (after rubbing the lamp!). The next afternoon, Dr. Wallace is hosting 
   Alex's high school class on a field trip to the museum, which 
   includes teacher Eve Ferrell (Deborah Winters again), whom the 
   widowed Dr. Wallace has romantic interest in. Also along on the class 
   trip are Alex's new boyfriend Ted (Scott Bankston) and her abusive ex-boyfriend
    Mike (Mark &quot;Red&quot; Mitchell; <B><A HREF="forever_evil_1987.htm">FOREVER
    EVIL</A></B> - 1987), who sneaks into the museum because he was 
   actually expelled from school after a violent episode where he vowed 
   to get revenge on everyone. Dr. Bressling chemically dates the lamp 
   to 3500 B.C. and programs the museum computer to translate the 
   inscriptions. After the field trip is over, Alex, Ted and some of the 
   students decide to illegally spend the night at the museum and will 
   not only have to put up with a vengeful mike, but also a murderous 
   djinn (or genie) which is released from the lamp and possesses Alex. 
   Let the killings begin.&nbsp; Adequately directed by Tom Daley (his 
   only mainstream film, although he has directed adult films using the 
   name &quot;Rex Mundo&quot;), who uses sweeping crane shots and 
   steadicam work to simulate the POV of the mostly unseen genie. <B><A HREF="outing_1987.htm">THE
    OUTING</A></B> mixes gory killings (besides the ones already 
   mentioned, Dr. Bressling is pulled-up to the spinning blades of a 
   ceiling fan; a museum guard is impaled by a floating spear; Ross 
   [Barry Coffing] is cut in two; Babs [Damon Merrill] is bitten by 
   poisonous snakes all over her body while taking a bath; Terry [Raan 
   Lewis] has a snake crawl up his pant leg and bites him on his penis; 
   Tony [Andre Chimeme] has his head turned around 360 degrees while a 
   metal mask tightens around his head; Mike is impaled by a horned mask 
   he is wearing while raping the high school principal's daughter, Gwen 
   [Trayce Walker]; Ted has his fingers bitten-off and neck chewed-on by 
   a mummy who has come to life; and Alex's wish about her father comes 
   true) with some less-than-professional acting . Most of the actors 
   here, with the exceptions of Deborah Winters (<B><A HREF="tarantulas_deadly_cargo.htm">TARANTULAS:
    THE DEADLY CARGO</A></B> - 1977), Red Mitchell and Blue Deckert, 
   have never appeared in another film, which speaks volumes. Warren 
   Chaney's screenplay is a standard &quot;teens trapped in a locked 
   facility while a killer is on the loose&quot; plot, but some of the 
   deaths are memorable and there's a heaping helping of female nudity. 
   There's also an unnecessary subplot about Dr. Wallace proposing 
   marriage to Eve that only serves in getting the two to the museum to 
   save Alex. When the genie does reveal itself in the finale, it's a 
   ridiculous rubber concoction, but at least it's not CGI. The late <A HREF="late breaking news.htm#Robert A. Burns">Robert

    A professor and a guinea pig exposed to the bacteria escape the lab

    Captain Kirk (David Warbeck), sent to investigate the disappearance 
   of the professor (who the chemical company says is on a &quot;fishing 
   trip&quot;) and a series of brutal mutilations where the victims were 
   chemically burned and drained of blood. Captain Kirk (snicker) joins 
   forces with chemical company scientist Jane (Janet Agren), who is 
   unaware of her company's criminal behavior, to locate the professor 
   and put an end to the grisly killings. After finding the giant 
   mutated guinea pig in the sewers, Kirk puts the pieces together. 
   Meanwhile, the Army has quietly quarantined the entire town and is 
   ready to kill everyone if Kirk doesn't locate and kill the professor 
   (with a decontamination gun!). After the professor attacks a movie 
   theater full of people, the town becomes panicked, forcing the Army 
   to give Kirk twelve hours to find the professor or the town will be 
   wiped off the map. This boring slice of Italian tripe (it's like a 
   more bloody version of <B><A HREF="andromeda_strain_1971.htm">THE 
   ANDROMEDA STRAIN</A></B> - 1971), directed by Tonino Ricci (<B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Rush1983">RUSH</A></B> 
   - 1983), using his &quot;Anthony Richmond&quot; pseudonym, really 
   doesn't have much to recommend in way of entertainment value.&nbsp; 
   The print I viewed was shorn of all nudity, but couldn't have been a 
   TV print since all the violence and language seems intact. The film 
   moves at a snail's pace and both the late David Warbeck and Janet 
   Agren (who would later team up for <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#rATMAN">THE
    RAT MAN</A></B> - 1987) look bored throughout. As with most Italian 
   horror films, the dubbing is terrible and the dialogue borders on the 
   insane (&quot;This is all top secret. Don't forget it.&quot; is 
   Warbeck's reply to a police sargeant when he explains the town's 
   situation.). Another problem is the violence. It's pretty tame 
   considering the circumstances as most of the carnage is shown after 
   the fact. The movie theater attack sequence goes dark when the 
   professor rips through the screen (I believe the light comes from the 
   other end of the theater, doesn't it?), thereby robbing the viewer of 
   any potential enjoyment. Why waste your time with this when it looks 
   like it's going out of it's way to make you not watch it? Originally

   film opens during the Middle Ages, where we see a totally nude woman 
   running through the forest, being chased by a suit of armor-wearing 
   Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy; he played the same character in <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Horror Rises Tomb">HORROR

   hitting her over-and-over with it. We are then in Paris in modern 
   times, as Dr. Rigaud (Jose Vivo; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#HouseInsaneWomen71">HOUSE

    also with Naschy) is very ill; her heart is weak and she needs a 
   change of scenery; some place that has clean air and is free of 
   Paris' hustle and bustle. Paul tells Dr. Riguad that he has the 
   perfect place to take her; his family home in the country, the former 
   home of his ancestor Alaric de Marnac. But Paul doesn't know if 
   Genevieve will go there, as she has refused to go there since they 
   have been married. You see, Genevieve comes from a wealthy family and 
   her parents never liked Paul, since he was penniless and jobless when 
   he married Genevieve, so her parents wouldn't allow her to go to 
   Paul's &quot;lowly&quot; family home and would rather she lived in 
   the palatial mansion in Paris they gave her as a wedding gift, even 
   though Paul found himself a good job and became successful. Much to 
   Paul's surprise, Genevieve agrees to live in his family home (her 
   parents are long dead), knowing that she is very ill and this is just 
   what she needs to get better.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see the country home's housekeeper, Mabile (Lola Gaos; <B><A HREF="legend_of_blood_castle_1972.htm">THE
    LEGEND OF BLOOD CASTLE</A></B> - 1972), who has lived there since 
   Paul was a baby, has taken-in her troubled niece Julie (Francis 
   &quot;Pat&quot; Ondiviela) to help her at the house. Julie was a drug 
   addict, a prostitute and was about to serve some time in prison after 
   hooking up with a drug addict named Maurice, but Mabile took her in 
   since Julie's mother, Mabile's sister, has been long dead and her 
   father recently passed away under mysterious circumstances. Since 
   Mabile is her only family, she stepped in to take charge of Julie and 
   saved her from serving a prison term. Julie is a piece of work, 
   unappreciative that her Aunt saved her from a life in prison. She is 
   also lazy, not helping much around the house and complaining when she 
   does. When she looks at the portrait of Alaric de Mannac hanging on a 
   wall, she mentions to Mabile that he is handsome (We can all see 
   where this is heading!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    On the drive to the country home, Paul's car runs out of gas in the 
   middle of nowhere and he has to walk to the nearest gas station to 
   get some more. Genevieve wants to go with him, but Paul says no, the 
   long walk would not be good for her heart, telling his wife to wait 
   in the car, relax, turn on the radio and listen to some music, he 
   will be back soon. A short time later, two brutal thieves (played by 
   Jose Sacristan Hernandez; Naschy's <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightOfThe Werewolf">NIGHT
    OF THE WEREWOLF</A></B> [1980] and Charly Bravo; Naschy's <B><A HREF="beast_and_the_magic_sword_1983.htm">THE
    BEAST AND THE MAGIC SWORD</A></B> [1983]) wake up a sleeping 
   Genevieve, make her get out of the car, rob her of her jewelry and 
   then try to rape her, but Paul shows up in the nick of time, beats 
   the snot out of the thieves (using some wrestling moves) and they run 
   away. Genevieve almost dies from the ordeal, as her heart nearly 
   stops from the stress, but she recovers thanks to Paul's heroics. 
   When they arrive at the country home (I want to call it a castle 
   since it is so huge), Mabile happily welcomes them and introduces 
   them to Julie; Mabile telling Genevieve that Julie will be her 
   personal assistant, helping her take her medications, taking her 
   outside for short walks and, generally, taking care of her every 
   need. At first, Genevieve doesn't like Julie, telling Paul that she 
   doesn't like the way she looks at him; like a whore would look at a 
   wealthy man, but, over time, they become friends and enjoy each 
   other's company. Or so it seems.. On one of their walks outside, 
   Genevieve asks Julie if she knows anything about Alaric de Marnac. 
   Julie says she doesn't know much about him, but takes a reluctant 
   Julie to Alaric's grave, which is on the property. At the gravesite, 
   Genevieve sees a poisonous snake slithering on Alaric's grave and she 
   screams, telling Julie that she's deathly afraid of snakes and it is 
   one of her worst fears. So why does Julie have a sly smile on her 
   face? Genevieve doesn't know it, but her life is about to become the 
   stuff of nightmare fuel.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While Paul tells Genevieve that he would rather spend all his time 
   with her, he says his job requires him to spend a couple of weeks in 
   Paris. While he is away, every night something horrific happens to 
   Genevieve, but Mabile is unable to help her since someone is spiking 
   her nightly glass of milk, causing her to pass out and not wake up 
   until the following morning. Her cries for Julie also go unanswered. 
   One night, Genevieve turns down the covers of her bed, only to 
   discover that the same snake she saw on Alaric's grave is on her bed. 
   She screams and runs out of her bedroom, only to discover someone in 
   a suit of armor is trying to kill her with a double-balled mace. 
   Could Alaric have arisen from his grave or could this be explained 
   under less supernatural conditions? Each night gets worse and worse 
   for Genevieve, as the person in armor and even the two thieves, who 
   are now decaying zombies, chase her throughout the house, her calls 
   to Julie and Mabile going unanswered. Genevieve grows so weak, she 
   can hardly stand and the end comes for her when the person in the 
   armor once again threatens to hit her with the mace, but this time 
   the headpiece comes off, revealing a skull for a face. Genevieve's 
   heart gives out and she dies on the spot.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It turns out the skull was nothing but a mask being worn by...Paul. 
   He and Julie are lovers, yet Paul planned on killing his wife long 
   before he met Julie. Even the two rapist thieves were hired by Paul; 
   revealing they were wearing makeup appliances on their faces to look 
   like zombies. Paul has long despised Genevieve and killed her (for 
   what else?) her money. No one would be even slightly suspicious that 
   he murdered Genevieve, since everyone knew she had a weak heart. 
   Local physician Dr. Lacombe (Manuel Zarzo; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#EncountersDeep1979">ENCOUNTERS
    IN THE DEEP</A></B> - 1979) signs her death certificate in Paul's 
   home, her cause of death being a coronary since she had a weak heart, 
   which means her lawyers have no other choice than to expedite the 
   reading of her will, which states that Paul gets her entire fortune. 
   After Genevieve's funeral, Paul and Julie become secret lovers, but 
   they don't realize that Mabile has overheard them discussing planning 
   Genevieve'e death, even hearing that Julie spiked her milk every 
   night with sleeping pills so she couldn't help Genevieve. The next 
   morning Mabile confronts Paul, telling him she overheard everything 
   and that Julie is nothing but trouble, she may even be responsible 
   for her father's death. Paul tells Mabile to relax; he'll take care 
   of her and make sure she wants for nothing for the rest of her life, 
   but Mabile is having none of it, telling Paul that she is shocked by 
   his behavior; she took care of him like a mother when he was a baby 
   and didn't raise him to be a murderer. She tells Paul she will be 
   quitting her position as the housekeeper very soon and she doesn't 
   know if she can remain silent about the whole affair.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Paul then goes to Paris for the reading of the will, where we 
   discover he was having an affair with a woman named Marielle (Silvia 
   Miro). She surprises Paul in his Paris home and tells him that they 
   can now be seen in public and she is never going to leave him. Paul 
   has other ideas, however.&nbsp; He is about to strangle Marielle as 
   she sleeps in his bed, but she wakes up before she is able to do it 
   (As brutal as Paul is, he's a coward when it comes to killing anyone 
   with their eyes open or still breathing). We then find out that Julie 
   is still seeing Maurice (We only see his hands and the back of his 
   head), telling him to be patient, they both will be rich soon. When 
   Paul returns to the country home, he kills Mabile by stringing a wire 
   across the top stair of the staircase, Mabile tripping over it and 
   breaking her neck in the fall. The phone then rings and Julie picks 
   it up. It's Marielle and she says she is coming to the house to pay a 
   visit to Paul. Julie tells her Paul isn't home, but Marielle says she 
   doesn't care, she's coming. Paul then discovers that Mabile isn't 
   quite dead, so Julie strangles her with her bare hands when Paul 
   refuses to do it. The doorbell rings and it's Marielle, so Paul tells 
   Julie to tell her he is not home.&nbsp; Marielle forces her way past 
   Julie and states she will wait until he comes home, only for Julie to 
   graphically kill her with a medieval hand axe, first cutting her 
   stomach open while her innards fall to the floor&nbsp; and then 
   finishing her off by splitting her skull in two (another very gory 
   effect). Paul tells Julie that he will dump Marielle's car in the 
   lake while she cleans up the blood on the floor. Then they will call 
   Dr. Lacombe and tell him to come over, Mabile has died in a tragic 
   accident. Everything seems to be going swimmingly for Paul and Julie, 
   but when Paul asks Julie to wash his back while he is taking a bath, 
   she throws a plugged-in electric heater into the bath water, 
   electrocuting Paul. Julie then calls Maurice and tells him they are 
   now rich, but when she hangs up the phone, she is chased by someone 
   in armor swinging a double-balled mace. When she is cornered in the 
   home's chapel, the headpiece is removed, revealing <A HREF="panic_beats_1983.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/panic beats spain dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>another

    This extremely bloody and nudity-filled supernatural horror film 
   (every woman in the film, except for Mabile, has as least one 
   full-frontal nude scene. The barrel-chested Naschy also has a couple 
   of nude scenes, but we don't see his wang, just his naked ass) was 
   directed by Naschy using his given name, Jacinto Molina (Naschy 
   directed 23 of his 100+ films).&nbsp; He also co-wrote the screenplay 
   with an uncredited Antonio Fos, who also wrote or co-wrote the 
   screenplays&nbsp; to <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Apartment13thFl72">THE 
   APARTMENT ON THE 13TH FLOOR</A></B> (1972), <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#It Happened Nightma">IT

    VAMPIRES NIGHT ORGY</A></B> (1973), all excellent Spanish horror 
   films. Naschy is especially effective in his role as Paul, acting 
   like he actually loves and cares for Genevieve (Julia Saly was also 
   this film's Producer) until she is dead; then his true colors are 
   revealed. This film is somewhat different from Naschy's other films 
   due to its completely nasty tone and the double, triple, and even 
   quadruple-crosses within. The only truly innocent people in this film 
   are Genevieve and Mabile, yet both of them meet very nasty ends. 
   Everyone dies a very nasty death when the film ends, however, so no 
   one gets away with anything. What human hands couldn't kill, the 
   supernatural does, making this film not just a treat for horror 
   fanatics, but also for fans of revenge flicks. This film has it all, 
   including ultra-gory deaths and non-stop nudity, which is why Paul 
   Naschy is my favorite Spanish personality, which is also why his 2009 
   obituary will forever be on the homepage of this site. This man 
   deserves my respect because all he ever wanted to be was a horror 
   film actor and he achieved that fame, whether as the werewolf 
   Waldemar Daninsky or his many other roles in horror films from the 
   '60s until his death. There will never be anyone like him again.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    desolate highways of 1992 Southwest America (Where unleaded gas is 
   $40.57 a gallon. And we thought we had it bad!) looking for a place 
   to finish his experiments before a fully-grown parasite bursts out of 
   his stomach. He finds an out of the way motel to perform his 
   experiments, even though the nosey owner (Vivian Blaine) likes to 
   interrupt him every now and then. Paul makes friends with Collins (Al 
   Fann), the owner of the local diner and Pat (Demi Moore, in her 
   second film), a local farmer. Paul makes enemies with Ricus (Luca 
   Bercovici) and his gang of local ruffians. When Ricus steals Paul's 
   canister, which contains another parasite, and opens it, it starts a 
   chain of events which leads the town to fight a fully-grown parasite. 
   Meanwhile, a take-no-prisoners government agent, called a Merchant 
   (James Davidson), is looking for Paul and wants to bring him back to 
   the government lab before the parasite inside him bursts out. Paul is 
   able to control the parasite inside him with daily injections of 
   tranquilizers directly into his stomach, but time is running out. 
   With the government after him, a giant parasite on the loose and the 
   one inside him ready to escape, Paul has to think quick if he wants 
   to save his new friends.&nbsp; As far as low-budget horror films go, <B><A HREF="parasite_1982b.htm">PARASITE</A></B> 
   is pretty decent, even without the 3-D effects (although one 3-D 
   scene with a pipe spurting out blood after being shoved into 
   someone's stomach is very well done and is equally good shown flat). 
   The parasite effects, by Stan Winston and his crew, are appropriately 
   squishy and disgusting. The real standout here is Luca Bercovici as 
   Ricus, who at first is portrayed as a cruel gang leader, but as 
   members of his posse become infected and die, he switches gears and 
   becomes a hero. Bercovici would later go on to direct <B><A HREF="ghoulies_1985.htm">GHOULIES</A></B>

   (2000). A lot was made of Demi Moore's participation in this (it was 
   the film's major selling point when released on VHS), but her acting 
   didn't impress me much and still doesn't up to this day. This was 
   directed and produced by Charles Band before his Full Moon days, when 
   it seemed he actually cared somewhat about the quality of the films 
   he was making. While most reference books give this film a very low 
   rating, I think most horror fans will find something here to enjoy, 
   whether it's Cheryl Smith's topless scenes early in the film, the 
   crisp photography by Mac Ahlberg, the bloody special effects or 
   enjoying the 3-D effects in 2-D. Also starring Cherie Currie, Tom

    comatose patients, including the open-eyed Patrick (Jackson 
   Gallagher), who is kept in his own room and is frequently injected 
   with Dr. Roget's unknown serum (he is basically Dr. Roget's guinea 
   pig). Patrick spits in Kathy's face and is told by Nurse Williams 
   that this is an involuntary reflex, but Kathy seems to think that 
   Patrick is trying to communicate with her (he is). Patrick has the 
   ability to make people do what he wants with his telekinetic powers 
   and he sets his sights on &quot;protecting&quot; Kathy, at first 
   communicating with her by spitting (one spit for yes, two spits for 
   no) and then having control of a computer's keyboard, typing out that 
   he is looking out for Kathy's best interests. Patrick will only show 
   Kathy that he is able to communicate and when she tries to show Dr. 
   Roget that Patrick is not comatose, he does nothing to respond. 
   Things turn deadly when anyone shows an interest in Kathy, including 
   her ex-boyfriend Ed (Damon Gameau), who is forced by Patrick's mind 
   control to put both his hands on a George Foreman grill (!), burning 
   both his hands until the flesh melts off and then killing 
   psychiatrist/new boyfriend Brian (Martin Crewes; <B><A HREF="resident_evil_2002.htm">RESIDENT
    EVIL</A></B> - 2002) by taking over his car and driving him over a 
   cliff (but first he takes control of Brian's body and spits in 
   Karen's face, showing her the powers he has). For patient viewers 
   (this film does move at a leisurely pace), the final 25 minutes will 
   be an edge-of-the-seat thriller, complete with gory deaths (including 
   a graphic electrocution followed by eyeball-popping), as the real 
   reason why Patrick is in a coma is revealed (it's the same reason as 
   the first film, only much more graphic and nudity-filled) and Kathy 
   realizes that Patrick is not so innocent as he makes himself out to 
   be. A running joke about a horribly burned patient named Morris (Rod 
   Mullinar), who is trained by Dr. Roget to turn on the lighthouse at 
   exactly 7:00AM every morning, actually plays an important part in the 
   finale. Documentary filmaker Mark Hartley (<B><A HREF="not_quite_hollywood_2008.htm">NOT

   sprinkles it with homages to late director Richard Franklin's 
   original (which was written by Australian master screenwriter Everett 
   De Roche; the remake was written by newcomer Justin King), including 
   Charles Dance listening to Brian May's original music from the 1978 
   film in his headphones (the soundtrack music was replaced by a Goblin 
   score in Europe; Dario Argento scorer Pino Donnagio does the music in 
   the remake) and having Ed's last name as Penhaligon, a tribute to 
   Susan Penhaligon, who played Kathy in the original film. Antony I. 
   Ginnane produced both the original and the remake. The original did 
   inspire an unrelated 1980 Italian film, <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#PatrickStillLives80">PATRICK

   means that it is left open for a possible real sequel in the future. 
   Worth a look for those that were fond of Australia's Golden Age Of 
   Horror, which ran from the mid-70's to the mid-80's. This is a very

    14</A><A NAME="PerkinsFourteen2008"></A> (2008) -</B> Ten years ago, 
   fourteen children disappeared from the town of Stone Cove, including 
   the son of police officer Dwayne Hopper (Patrick O'Kane), never to be 
   seen or heard of again. Now, ten years to the day of his son's 
   abduction, Dwayne is manning police headquarters on his own when 
   prisoner Ronald Perkins (Richard Brake) asks him to let him out of 
   jail because his children are all alone. Dwayne immediately becomes 
   suspicious of Perkins and believes he is the Stone Cove Killer, based 
   on a missing finger on Perkins' hand. The more Dwayne digs into 
   Perkins' background, the more he believes that he is responsible for 
   his son's and the other thirteen childrens' disappearances, so Dwayne 
   has fellow police officer Hal (Dean Sansone) check out Perkins' home. 
   Dwayne loses radio contact with Hal when he discovers a secret room 
   in the basement and the audience watches as Hal accidentally opens a 
   bunch of cages containing the now-<A HREF="perkins_14_2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/perkins' 14 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="201" HEIGHT="280" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>adult
    fourteen missing children and they are ravenous for human flesh, so 
   they chow-down on Hal's body. Dwayne plays a psychological 
   cat-and-mouse game with Perkins at the police station, while fourteen 
   zombie-like flesheaters begin terrorizing Stone Cove, including 
   Dwayne's rebellious daughter Daisy (Shayla Beesley) and her punk 
   boyfriend Eric (Michael Graves). When Dwayne goes to Perkins' house 
   and discovers Hal's mutilated corpse in the secret room, he also 
   finds a library of video tapes that shows Perkins torturing the 
   children, including his son. Dwayne becomes enraged and brings 
   Perkins to the secret room, where Perkins taunts Dwayne until Dwayne 
   shoots him right between the eyes. Dwayne must now try to save Daisy, 
   fully aware that one of the silent killers is his own son (The 
   fourteen, for some unknown reasons, are impervious to bullets). 
   Dwayne is also unaware that his wife, Janine (Mihaela Mihut), is 
   having an affair until his own daughter informs him, so he, Daisy, 
   Eric and an unnamed townie (Who calls the killers 
   &quot;monsters&quot;, to which Dwayne replies, &quot;They're not 
   monsters. They're victims.&quot;) head to the local motel to save her 
   (Me personally? I would have let her rot in Hell.). After saving 
   Janine (whose illicit lover is graphically beaten in the face 
   over-and-over with a champagne bottle by one of the killers), 
   everyone hides out in the basement of the police station, while 
   Dwayne tries to figure out if there is a way to communicate with his 
   son. As the cast is whittled-away one-by-one by the hungry killers, 
   Dwayne never gives up hope that he can get through to his son and get 
   the entire family back together to live a normal life. The nihilistic 
   ending shows that family is not always thicker than blood.&nbsp; 
   Besides the obvious plot holes you could drive a Mack truck through 
   (Like why ten years of extreme torture can make the children immune 
   to bullets, which is addressed unconvincingly by one police officer 
   as Perkins feeding them &quot;drugs&quot; the years they were in 
   captivity. What drugs are these, because I would like to take some!), <B><A HREF="perkins_14_2008b.htm">PERKINS'
    14</A></B> is a mostly effective and very bloody take on the zombie 
   genre (which is beginning to get played-out as of late). I also liked 
   how Dwayne is such a tortured soul (he can never forgive himself for 
   his son's abduction, especially since he's a cop) and an 
   unconventional hero, since Irish actor Patrick O'Kane (who does a 
   great job hiding his Irish accent) is anything but the conventional 
   handsome leading man type. The violence and gore is very graphic 
   (pushing its R-Rating to the very razor's edge of an NC-17 or Unrated 
   tag), including gut-munching, intestine-yanking, dismemberment 
   (Dwayne blowing the legs off one of the killers with a shotgun is a 
   highlight) and plenty of gun violence. Director Craig Singer (<B><A HREF="dark_ride_2006.htm">DARK
    RIDE</A></B> - 2006) and screenwriter Lane Shadgett have managed to 
   fashion a reasonably engrossing horror flick (besides the flashbacks, 
   the entire film takes place during one night) that manages to touch 
   on unusual horror subjects such as family guilt (Dwayne tortures 
   himself internally, Janice turns to alcohol and infidelity, while 
   Daisy has no other choice than to rebel to be noticed) and hopeless 
   optimism (as the very downbeat finale shows) with absolutely no sense 
   of humor (which is refreshing). Worthwhile viewing if you can ignore 
   the gigantic plot holes. Also starring Gregory O'Connor, Katherine 
   Pawlak, Josh Davidson, Jeremy Donaldson, Trey Farley and C.J. Singer.

    OF THE MALL: ERIC'S REVENGE</A><A NAME="PhantomOfTheMall"></A> 
   (1988) -</B> The 80's churned out dozens of cheapjack horror flicks 
   based on classic novels. This one is an updated take on Gaston 
   Leroux's 1910 novel &quot;The Phantom Of The Opera&quot; and it's 
   pretty bad. The town of Midwood is celebrating the grand opening of 
   the Midwood Mall, an expansive shopping center that offers many jobs 
   to the town'<A HREF="phantom_of_the_mall_erics_revenge_1989b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/phantom of the mall poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="178" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>s
    teenage population. The mall also comes complete with it's own 
   monster, the horribly-scarred Eric Matthews (Derek Rydall; <B><A HREF="night_visitor_1989.htm">NIGHT
    VISITOR</A></B> - 1989), who a year earlier was trapped in a 
   suspicious fire in his own home and left for dead. Eric's 
   then-girlfriend, Melody Austin (Kari Whitman; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Masterblaster">MASTERBLASTER</A></B> 
   - 1986), was sure the fire was intentionally started and believed 
   Eric was murdered by someone wearing a religious earring, but the 
   police thought Melody was in shock and imagined it. Melody has taken 
   a job at the mall (which was built on the site of Eric's fire-ravaged 
   home) as a salesgirl and Eric (who wears a half-mask on his face, as 
   all phantoms should) keeps track of her movements by tapping into the 
   mall's security system, saving her in the parking garage from a ski 
   mask-wearing rapist by shooting him with a crossbow. Eric also begins 
   killing the mall's security guards (he travels store-to-store by 
   using the mall's unusually large air conditioning vents), but the 
   mall's owner, Harve Posner (Jonathan Goldsmith), covers-up the 
   killings for reasons that become abundantly clear rather quickly. It 
   seems Harv is responsible for the fire at Eric's house and he has 
   hired the same killer that set that fire, Christopher Volker (Gregory 
   Scott Cummins; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Cartel">CARTEL</A></B> - 
   1990), to take care of his new problem at the mall. Newspaper 
   photographer Peter Baldwin (Rob Estes; TV's <B><A HREF="silk_stalkings_tv_series_1991-1999.htm">SILK
    STALKINGS</A></B>) notices the St. Christophers earring that Volker 
   is wearing and informs Melody that she just may not have been in 
   shock a year earlier. Peter and Melody begin a romance, which doesn't 
   sit too well with Eric. The rest of the film is mainly a series of 
   murders, as Eric begins disposing of the people he determines 
   deserves to die. We watch as a peeping tom guard has his face shoved 
   into the blades of a spinning fan; the mall's pianist (and Melody's 
   would-be rapist) is bitten in the crotch by a cobra while tending to 
   his crossbow wound in the Men's Room; and Harv's obnoxious son, 
   Justin (Tom Fridley), has a rope tied around his neck and is dragged 
   into the blades of a moving escalator. Melody and Peter determine 
   that Eric is still alive (they dig up his grave just to make sure) 
   and figure out Harv's treachery (after narrowly escaping Volker's 
   grasp in a car chase through the mall's parking garage). They report 
   their findings to Mayor Karen Wilton (Morgan Fairchild, in what 
   amounts to an extended cameo), who tells Melody and Peter that they 
   must find Eric before the mall's Fourth of July grand opening 
   ceremony in order to prove Harv's deadly intrigue. Eric kidnaps 
   Melody and brings her to his subterranean hideout, located in the 
   mall's cavernous basement. Peter swoops in to save her and must get 
   her out of the mall before Eric sets off a bomb at the mall's opening 
   ceremony. The Mayor turns out to be as crooked as Harv, so <A HREF="phantom_of_the_mall_erics_revenge_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/phantom of the mall eric's revenge dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="171" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Eric
    kills them both before the malls erupts into a huge fireball. Does 
   Eric survive the explosion? I guess it all depends on how you read 
   the film's vague closing shot. I, for one, hope we never see him 
   again.&nbsp; This ridiculous horror film, directed by Richard 
   Friedman (<B><A HREF="deathmask_1983.htm">DEATHMASK</A></B> - 1983; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Doom Asylum">DOOM
    ASYLUM</A></B> - 1987; <B><A HREF="scared_stiff_1987.htm">SCARED STIFF</A></B> 
   - 1987), defies all logic. The script, by Scott J. Schneid, Tony 
   Michelman and Robert King (who also wrote the screenplay to the 
   far-superior <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Nest1987">THE NEST</A></B> 
   [1987] and Cirio H. Santiago's <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Silk2">SILK
    2</A></B> [1989]), is full of so many questionable circumstances and 
   plot holes, a five year-old could point them out: A huge mall like 
   this built in less than a year? Who buried Eric's empty coffin? Does 
   being scarred by fire give you superhuman strength and make you a 
   martial arts expert? Would a mall's basement have walls carved out of 
   solid rock? What kind of mall store would actually carry a 
   flame-thrower as an in-stock item? The mind boggles! I think the 
   unmasking scene is the film's most interesting moment. Unlike most 
   film versions of Phantom Of The Opera, the Phantom is not unmasked by 
   his perceived lady love while playing the organ, but rather while he 
   is pumping iron! Besides a couple of gory deaths (One of the guards 
   has his eyes popped-out; Volker is decapitated by an industrial 
   garbage disposal), this film doesn't have much going for it in it's 
   favor. For one example, fourth-billed Pauly Shore (that's right, Pauly-fucking-Shore!)
    is given ample screen time to strut his patented &quot;Valley 
   Dude&quot; schtick as Buzz, the mall's frozen yogurt shop employee. 
   This film was made a couple of years before Shore would find a 
   (thankfully) short-lived career starring in a series of awful 
   comedies (I won't bother mentioning the titles and shame on you if 
   you know them!). He actually gets top billing on the DVD packaging, 
   as if that's a selling point. Believe it or not, besides Pauly 
   Shore's antics, the film is played deadly serious. Therein lies the 
   flaw. How can anyone expect a film with a title like this to be 
   anything but a comedy? In all fairness, the closing tune by The 
   Vandals, titled &quot;Is There A Phantom In The Mall?&quot;, 
   perfectly sums up the film (as well as gave me a good laugh). The 
   lyrics go: &quot;Is he the Phantom of the Mall or just some retard in 
   a broken hockey mask?&quot; I couldn't say it any better. Also 
   starring Kimber Sissons, John Walter Davis, Dante D'Andre, Terrence 
   Evans and Ken Foree as the mall's clueless head of security.

   are handcuffed together and they search the island to collect the

   ancient pinata, which, in the prologue, is used to collect all the 
   sins of a Central America town and sent floating down the ocean. The 
   stoned couple crack open the pinata with a rock, which brings the 
   pinata to life, slaughtering the participants in various ways. You'll 
   see heads cracked open repeatedly with a shovel, a guy's crotch 
   ripped out, a beheading and other bloody killings. The Pinata itself 
   is a crafty creation but proved troublesome in post-production, as it 
   was not deemed scary enough. The Pinata was mostly replaced with a 
   CGI version that, for the most part, looks frightening but not real 
   enough. Sometimes it reminded me of the Tasmanian Devil in the old 
   Warner Bros. cartoons as it's legs disappear and begins to fly 
   through the air. The beheading is also quite obviously a CGI 
   creation. Another thing about the film that really bothers me is that 
   whenever the Pinata is on the screen, the sound's decimal level rises 
   considerably. It becomes really distracting after a while. And why do 
   monsters have to have a POV that's always distorted and hard for the 
   viewer to tolerate? Can't monsters see normally with their eyes?

    PIT</A><A NAME="Pit"></A> (1981) - </B>Poor little 12 year-old Jamie 
   (Sammy Snyders). He is disliked by nearly everyone and has two major 
   problems: He has a teddy bear called Teddy who tells him to do nasty 
   things and he as also discovered a big hole (the &quot;<A HREF="pit_1981b.htm">pit</A>&quot;
    in the title) in the woods that happens to be inhabited by a group 
   of Trogs, or &quot;Tra-la-logs&quot; as Jamie calls them. When his 
   parents go away on a long trip and leave Jamie with a nanny (Jeannie 
   Elias), he grows a crush on her which turns deadly. He spies on her 
   taking a shower, tells her that he loves her and also tells her the 
   secret of the Trogs, which she does not believe. Jamie is truly a 
   demented little soul, with nothing but sex on his brain. He tricks a

   strip by her window by telling her that he has kidnapped her neice. 
   He leaves sexy pictures for the librarian to find. He also must find 
   a way to feed the Trogs. He first buys cheap meat from the butcher to 
   feed to them but soon runs out of money. He then decides to feed the 
   Trogs all the people that have wronged him (thanks to a suggestion by 
   Teddy). His first victim is a little girl who refuses to let him ride 
   her bike. His next victim is a wheelchair-ridden old lady who tattled 
   on him. Up next is the nanny's boyfriend. The next two victims are a 
   teenage boy who punched him in the face and the girl who laughed 
   while it happened. When all these people are noticed missing, the 
   nanny begins to believe Jamie and he shows her the pit. She is amazed 
   at what she sees and tells Jamie that they must report their find to 
   the scientific community. Jamie wants it to be their secret and the 
   nanny accidently falls into the pit, to be graphically eaten by the 
   Trogs. Jamie has no more enemies to feed to the Trogs, so he throws a 
   rope down the pit which allow the Trogs to come up to the surface. 
   They kill several more people before the police find them back in 
   their pit and shoot them all. They then fill in the pit with dirt. 
   Jamie is sent to live with his grandparents, where he meets a girl 
   who has a surprise for him. This odd Canadian-made film (lensed in 
   Beaver Dam, Wisconsin) is hilarious and mean-spirited at the same 
   time. Jamie is definitely a sociopath, but the way some people treat 
   him, you can't help but cheer him on when he leads them to the pit. 
   Director Lew Lehman (an actor/writer, this being his only directorial 
   effort) imbues the film with enough gore, nudity and absurd 
   situations (such as when one of the policemen calls in to say that 
   they have killed a pack of wild dogs when he knows that they weren't) 
   to make this 96 minute film fly by. This is an undiscovered gem that 
   soon will get a DVD release by Anchor Bay (or so they promised for a

    TOWN</A><A NAME="PlagueTown2008"></A> (2008) -</B> Fourteen years 
   ago, a rash of mutated children were being born in a sleepy little 
   Irish town. The babies looked so disgusting that the local priest 
   would attend every birth and shoot the babies in the head, sending 
   their Godless souls straight to Hell. On the very last birth, the 
   father of the newborn mutated baby says enough is enough and kills 
   the priest (first by planting a fireplace poker in the back of his 
   head, followed by a hatchet to his face) before he has the chance to 
   kill the baby. What happened to that baby? We'll soon find out. Cut 
   to the present (well at least 2008 anyway), as we witness the 
   American Monohan family: Molly (Josslyn DeCrosta), Jessica (Erica 
   Rhodes) and father Jerry (David Lombard), along with Jessica's 
   boyfriend Robin (James Warke) and Jerry's fiancee Annette (Lindsay 
   Goranson), step off a bus and head out by foot looking for ruins in 
   the Irish countryside that may give clues to the Monahan's heritage. 
   As the <A HREF="plague_town_2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/plague town dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="195" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>quintet
    walk deeper into the countryside, it is obvious to see that the 
   Monohan family have issues; Molly has mental problems that she is 
   trying to control with medication and Jessica is a complete cunt. Not 
   only does she rag on Dad's new girlfriend, she makes Molly's life a 
   living hell. Because of Jessica's total lack of consideration for 
   everyone else, they miss the last bus for their motel and must trek 
   through the woods by foot, where they find an abandoned car in 
   perfect condition and Molly sees a freaky-looking kid in the 
   distance, but because she is &quot;mental&quot;, no one will believe 
   her. While the rest of the group take a siesta in the car, Robin and 
   Jessica see a light in the distance and check it out, finding a 
   ramshackle cabin with a single candle burning inside. On their way 
   back to the car, Robin and Jessica run into a pasty-faced individual 
   who tells Jessica, &quot;You better come with me, sweetheart. I hate 
   to see you go to waste.&quot; before he fires a shotgun blast 
   directly into Robin's face and then chases Jessica through the woods 
   while screaming, &quot;They'll find you. Mark my words, they'll find 
   you. You're better off with me!&quot; Jerry hears the shotgun blast 
   and goes searching for Jessica and Robin in the darkness of night. 
   Jerry meets two playful, but grotesque-looking young girls who stab 
   him with shards of glass and then cut off the top of his head with 
   razor wire (a well done effect). Yes, it seems the woods are full of 
   mutated killer children and they want to &quot;play&quot; with the 
   remaining survivors. It seems Robin somehow survived the shotgun 
   blast to his face and is led to shelter by Shiela (Elizabeth Bove), 
   the grandmother of Rosemary (Kate Aspinwall), the now 14 year-old 
   girl who was spared the priest's bullet in the beginning of the film. 
   When Molly and Jessica are the only ones left alive, they make a 
   discovery that these children are being created on purpose and the 
   leaders need more healthy women to inseminate until they finally get 
   it &quot;right&quot;. Are Molly and Jessica going to end up being the 
   ovens for the world's ugliest buns?&nbsp; This slow-moving, but 
   atmospheric horror film, directed by David Gregory (best known at the 
   time for directing the British documentary <B><A HREF="ban_the_sadist_videos_2005.htm">BAN
    THE SADIST VIDEOS!</A></B> [2005] and for directing supplementary 
   featurettes for many genre DVDs for the past decade) and co-written 
   by Gregory and John Cregan, takes its time getting to the good stuff, 
   but once it arrives, it will take a few days to get some of the 
   images out of your brain. While there have been a few killer children

   - 2008), I guarantee that you have never seen children quite like 
   this before. Rosemary, for one, looks to have been born without 
   eyelids, which make her eyes just pop-out from her face (her 
   &quot;romantic&quot; scene with Robin, whose right side of his face 
   is nothing but hanging, bloody flesh thanks to the shotgun blast, is 
   a classic of creepy, gross-out cinema). The other children, 
   especially the one with the huge fleshy jowls, who beats Annette to 
   death with a hubcap, are equally grotesque creations. Add to it the 
   fact that these children want to procreate (besides also being 
   cannibals!) and <B><A HREF="plague_town_2008b.htm">PLAGUE TOWN</A></B> 
   becomes one of the grossest films in recent memory. It's uber-bloody,

   contact with Audrey whenever Hester performs her black magic rituals. 
   Greta kills Audrey's brother Stephen (David Ellzey) by hiding in his

   killed by a car. Audrey's neighbor Monique (Carolyn Greenwood) is the

   boyfriend Jeff (David Cullinane), who is choked to death by Greta's 
   leash as she wraps it around a tree while Jeff is sitting next to it. 
   While Audrey starts going completely off the deep end, the detective 
   is sure that Greta has something to do with the murders. Greta's 
   leash is the turning point in the investigation as the detective is 
   sure that the leash was used to kill Jeff. Unfortunately, Greta picks 
   up a container of lye and poisons the detective's bromo drink at 
   Audrey's house, making it look like Audrey killed the detective.

   OF THE PLANETS</A></B> - 1966) wonders if the villager at the bridge 
   was right warning them not to come here, as she finds the Count 
   creepy, but Lucas says she is being ridiculous, it's obvious the 
   Count comes from old money, so everyone should treat him with respect 
   and quit listening to gossip. Katia (Maria Giovannini), who thinks 
   her legs are her best asset and always accuses Frank of staring at 
   them (even though he isn't), wonders if the Count is married, but 
   Lucas tells her to quit daydreaming, she is not up to the Count's 
   standards. Most of these girls are so self-centered and slutty, it's 
   no wonder why they get into trouble everywhere they go, but I doubt 
   they are prepared for the trouble they will find here.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Vera leaves her room at night when she sees the Count staring at her 
   through her bedroom window. The Count apologizes, telling her he's 
   been alone for so long, he doesn't know how to act in front of 
   people. He begs Vera to leave the castle in the morning, not telling 
   her why. Vera acts insulted, telling the Count (calling him by his 
   first name, Gabor) to use the door, not the window, if he wishes to 
   talk to her again. Katia also doesn't listen to the Count's demands, 
   leaving her bedroom at night to take a shower, grabbing Vera's coat 
   before she searches for the facilities. She hears a cat meowing and 
   tries to find it, only to get attacked by someone. The next morning, 
   Frank finds Katia's dead body on the castle grounds, telling Lucas 
   that she must have fell from one of the castle windows last night 
   (&quot;In the dark she must have lost her footing.&quot;). The girls 
   want to leave, but Lucas refuses because he still hasn't found a way 
   to turn this situation to his financial advantage. The Count comes 
   outside to tell everyone that he warned them about the rules and when 
   Lucas mentions contacting the police about Katia's death, the Count 
   says that is impossible, the river has swollen so bad due to last 
   night's storm that all the roads are now washed out, too. Contacting 
   the police is impossible because he has no telephone and there's no 
   way anyone can travel on the roads, even the police. They all must 
   now stay at the castle until it is safe to travel.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    After Katia is buried in a temporary grave in the castle's cemetery, 
   the girls practice their dance numbers&nbsp; (Way to grieve, girls!) 
   and Erika (Erika Di Centa) begins to <A HREF="playgirls_and_the_vampire_1960.htm#StripteasePhoto">perform
    a risque striptease</A> while Frank plays the piano (another NSFW 
   moment, especially for 1960), while Vera walks through the castle by 
   herself. She notices she bears a striking resemblance to a portrait 
   hanging on a wall. Beneath the portrait, it reads: &quot;Margherita 
   Kernassy 1746 - 1787&quot;. Gabor then appears and tells Vera that 
   Margherita was one of his ancestors and that she died in the castle. 
   He also tells her that her resemblance to Margherita is the reason 
   why he decided everyone could stay. And because she looks so much 
   like Margherita is the reason he wanted her to leave the castle. Vara 
   wants to know all about Margherita, but all Gabor will say is, 
   &quot;Her story is a very sad one. Her life was unhappy, as was her 
   death.&quot; Gabor once again apologizes to Vera, begging her not to 
   have a false impression of him, for &quot;solitude may have has an 
   influence on my character.&quot; He then tells Vera that he 
   &quot;expected&quot; her to come to the castle. Gabor believes 
   Margherita is living inside her and that her destiny is his destiny. 
   Vera says she feels it, too, she just knows that it is true. Gabor 
   tells Vera to believe in him, begging her once again to leave the 
   castle as soon as possible, for staying in the castle will only lead 
   to tragedy. Vera doesn't want to leave, telling Gabor that he is the 
   only man who ever inspired confidence in her. She has lead a 
   &quot;meaningless&quot; life that makes no sense at all, touring from 
   town-to-town with a second-rate company, but with him it's different. 
   It is as if she has always known him. They then <A HREF="playgirls_and_the_vampire_1960.htm#KissPassionately">kiss
    passionately</A>, Gabor once again begging her to leave, saying the 
   Kernassy coat of arms is covered in the blood of many innocent lives. 
   Before Vera can ask Gabor what he meant by that, Lucas calls for her 
   and says she has to practice the samba (Ah, the life in a second-rate company!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That night, Vera hears a noise outside her window and goes to 
   investigate, only to find Katia's grave dug up and empty. Gabor then 
   appears, his face white as snow. He then disappears as fast as he 
   appeared and&nbsp; Zoltan and Miss Balasz tell Vera to go inside 
   because it's not safe outside at night. Zoltan tells Miss Balasz he 
   saw the &quot;monster&quot; again, but she tells Zoltan to be quiet, 
   say nothing in front of strangers. Vera then looks for Gabor in the 
   castle and finds a laboratory, where Katia's dead body lies on a 
   gurney. Gabor appears and swears Vera to secrecy with what he is 
   about to tell her. He says Katia's death wasn't an accident; she was 
   murdered because she was wearing Vera's coat. Gabor tells her Katia 
   was killed by something not quite human, stopping himself before he 
   speaks the word &quot;vampire&quot;. Is Gabor a vampire? When Vera 
   tells him she saw him that night next to Katia's empty grave, he has 
   no memory of it. It's quite possible that Gabor has no idea he is a 
   vampire, or is there another reason for his lack of memory?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Frank spends the next day outside the castle and when he returns, he 
   tells everyone that the Count was telling the truth, the roads are 
   all washed out, but when he talked to some villagers, he discovered 
   that the man who warned them not to come to the castle was murdered 
   and the villagers say the killer lives in the castle. Frank believes 
   that the castle harbors a murderer, but Lucas and Vera tell him to 
   quit talking nonsense (both for different reasons) and quit believing 
   the superstitions of people he doesn't know. Frank is adamant in his 
   beliefs and says he is going to leave the castle the first chance it 
   is humanly possible and anyone can join him. While Lucas is sleeping 
   in his bed that night, a naked Katia pays him a visit, waking him up. 
   She then approaches Lucas (using some frank sexual language usually 
   not found in films of the time), bearing her fangs, as Lucas screams 
   and passes out. Everyone comes running into his room and when Lucas 
   says he saw Katia, no one believes him, saying he had a nightmare. 
   Later that night, Miss Balasz tells Vera that the bridge and roads 
   have been fixed and she and everyone else can leave in the morning, 
   but Vera asks if she will se Gabor before she leaves. Miss Balasz 
   replies, &quot;We'll see.&quot; Vera goes looking for Gabor and 
   discovers a secret passageway (every castle has at least one), which 
   leads her to the crypt we saw in the beginning of the film. She 
   discovers Margherita Kernassy's tomb and another tomb next to it, 
   which looks like it belongs to Gabor. A pasty-faced Gabor then 
   appears, bears his fangs and bites Vera on the neck. Vera then wakes 
   up in her bed the next morning with Miss Balasz at her side, telling 
   Vera she has had a bad fever the entire night, tossing and turning 
   and yelling something about a &quot;monster&quot;, as if Vera never 
   left her bed. When Vera gets up and looks in the mirror, she sees the 
   fang marks in her neck and quickly packs her bags to leave, when 
   Gabor appears, causing Vera to scream and run away. Vera then 
   discovers something that changes the entire dynamic of the film. If I 
   were to tell you what it is, I would be depriving you of the film's 
   biggest surprise. Needless to say, all the clues that point to this 
   revelation are in the review, but it is still surprising nonetheless. 
   So, who will live and who will die?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   lesser film of the two films, but not for the lack of trying 
   (Polselli is a gonzo director and Regnoli is not). This film is 
   sexually explicit for a film made in 1960, so much so, that when it 
   was released to U.S. theaters, it was recommended that &quot;Adults 
   Only&quot; view it. It's easy to see why. All the girls wear as 
   little clothes as possible, there's Erika's provocative striptease 
   and Katia's naked appearance in Lucas' bedroom, her naughty bits 
   covered by some well-placed shadows. Katia is also <A HREF="playgirls_and_the_vampire_1960.htm#StakedHeartTopless">staked

   (1978) antics with 80's slasher film conventions. A group of 
   fraternity pledges are about to go through Hell Week, where they are 
   put in degradating situations and forced to listen to verbal abuse 
   not heard since the times of slavery. One of the pledges, Larry (Todd 
   Eastland), learns from his mother that twenty years earlier a 
   fraternity occupying the same house was forced to disband after 
   killing a pledge during a hazing gone wrong. Mom tells Larry that her 
   boyfriend at the time, Sidney Snyder (Joey Belladonna; lead singer 
   for the rock group Anthrax), was supposed to take a bath in a 
   harmless mixture of disgusting ingredients, but someone also tossed 
   some muriatic acid into the mix, causing Sidney to be burned over his 
   entire body and eventually die. Hazing is now outlawed because of

    be put through will also turn deadly. They are led to believe that 
   fraternity brother Dan (Arthur Lundquist) is suffering from a brain 
   tumor (he's not), causing him to do crazy things, like stabbing a 
   fellow brother with a steak knife (he doesn't), but when Dan actually 
   does go mad and begins killing fraternity brothers and sorority 
   sisters, Larry and the other pledges at first think it's all just 
   another joke. It's not, of course, as Dan is actually possessed by 
   the acid-scarred spirit of Sidney (now portrayed by Will Kempe) and 
   soon Sidney bursts out of Dan's stomach (a terrible effect) and 
   begins chasing the pledges and sorority sister Wendy (Shannon 
   McMahon) through the house, cracking jokes like a '60s radical Freddy 
   Krueger (He actually says, &quot;That was for Spiro Agnew!&quot; as 
   he twists a pledge's head 180 degrees) while killing the pledges 
   one-by-one (in typical slasher fashion, the only black pledge, Cagle 
   [Craig Derrick], is the first to die). Pretty soon, the only people 
   left are Larry and Wendy, as we discover that Larry is actually 
   Sidney's son (it's telegraphed fairly early in the film). The final 
   coda will have you arching your eyebrows in utter disbelief.&nbsp; 
   Truly a chore to sit through, <B><A HREF="pledge_night_1988b.htm">PLEDGE
    NIGHT</A></B> (also known as <B><A HREF="hazing_in_hell_1988.htm">A 
   HAZING IN HELL</A></B>) contains stock characters, stock situations 
   and takes what seems like an eternity to get rolling. This is nothing 
   but a series of stupid hazing rituals (picking up cherries off a 
   block of ice with their ass; whip cream fights; paddle spankings; 
   strings tied to penises; fake turd-eating out of a toilet; raw egg 
   and live worm eating; etc.) followed by half-hearted attempts at 
   gore. Director Paul Ziller (this was his first effort, followed by 
   such films as <B><A HREF="bloodfist_series_dvd.htm">BLOODFIST IV: DIE TRYING</A></B> 
   [1992]; <B><A HREF="back_in_action_1994.htm">BACK IN ACTION</A></B>

   original films, beginning with <B><A HREF="snakehead_terror_2003.htm">SNAKEHEAD
    TERROR</A></B> [2003]) seems to forget what makes a good slasher 
   flick. Instead of showing us the killing actually happening on-screen 
   (like a death by portable mixer blade to the mouth; a lit cherry bomb 
   shoved up someone's ass), Ziller cops out and shows us the bodies 
   after the murders take place, robbing the viewer of any graphic 
   enjoyment. The acting is also uniformly weak across the board and 
   most of the actors seem way too old to be fraternity pledges. Most of 
   the latter half of the film is just endless shots of the pledges 
   tip-toeing around the fraternity house trying to avoid Sidney, 
   without much success. This is a crappy film of the highest order, 
   right up there with the similarly themed <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Rush Week">RUSH
    WEEK</A></B> (1989). Don't waste your valuable time with this 
   patently cheap flick. Producer/screenwriter Joyce Snyder apparently 
   loves her last name, because killer Sidney also shares it. Also 
   starring Dennis Sullivan, David Neal Evans, Robert Lentini (his 
   enormous nose has it's own gravitational orbit!), James Davies, 
   Lawton Paseka, Michael T. Henderson and Stephen Christopher Young.

   his films and this one does not disappoint. When an unknown assailant

    (Norma Moore) runs screaming into the woods and meets the creepy 
   Odis Pickett (Gene Ross, a Brownrigg regular who also co-wrote this). 
   Odis invites Helen back to the cabin to call the police , but when 
   she gets there, there is no phone, only Odis' strange family: His 
   retarded son Bo (Charlie Dell), mean-spirited daughter Sarah (Camilla 
   Carr, also in Brownrigg's <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Keep Grave Open">KEEP
    MY GRAVE OPEN</A></B> - 1973) and pregnant young wife Emmy (Ann 
   Stafford, also in <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Keep Grave Open">GRAVE</A></B>).
    Odis tries to rape Helen (as he has done to his own daughter Sarah 
   many times) and Bo ends up dead, impaled through the neck on an iron 
   fence by the unknown killer. Finding Bo dead has a strange effect on 
   Odis (he really loved his son and wonders, &quot;Who's goin' to bring 
   me my jar?&quot;) and orders Sarah to clean Bo up (she refuses) to 
   make him presentable when Odis goes for the preacher in the morning. 
   In the meantime we learn a lot about the remaining people in the 
   cabin such as Helen was married before (he died during the war), Emmy 
   was given to Odis by her father to pay off a debt and Odis really is 
   nothing but a filthy pig, threatening to kick Emmy in the belly just 
   before actually raping Helen. Odis makes Helen clean up Bo while 
   Sarah meets the killer in the woods (a POV shot of the killer is 
   shown strangling her with barbed wire while asking the killer if he 
   has a dollar!) walking to go get the preacher. While waiting for 
   Sarah to return, Helen says to Odis, &quot;You're too brutal and 
   sadistic to be real!&quot; Odis goes into the woods with his shotgun 
   to go look for Sarah (he finds her barely alive) and gets shot 
   through the eye with his own shotgun. The denouement is quite 
   surprising, as Helen's first husband Jim (Hugh Feagin) is still 
   alive, spending years at a POW camp before being rescued and placed 
   in a mental institution. He escaped and tracked Helen down, killing 
   everyone she came in contact with.&nbsp; Sarah crawls back with Pa's 
   shotgun and shoots Jim in the back before she dies. Helen decides to 
   stay in the cabin and take care of Emmy. The End. The late S.F.

   seemingly empty registry book (I count at least three clich&eacute;s 
   in that last sentence<A HREF="portal_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/portal 2006 poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="196" HEIGHT="282" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>).
    Hooke has a nightmare that involves a coven of witches performing a 
   sacrifice and when Gibbs wakes him up, they discover that they have 
   slept for over 24 hours and the fog is worse than ever. They have 
   dinner with the other occupants at the motel (a dinner which consists 
   of raw meat and brussel sprouts, which Hooke doesn't eat) and 
   discover that everyone else is also here because of the heavy fog. 
   Hooke becomes suspicious of Benedict and the motel staff when the 
   maid warns him that if he ever wants to leave this place, he's not to 
   eat the meat or drink the wine. When Gibbs disappears, Hooke does his 
   own undercover investigation. He watches as a coven of witches kidnap 
   a newly-registered honeymooning couple and toss the still-alive groom 
   into a ritualistic fire. The registered guests who ate the meal begin 
   to suffer similar fates: One woman shoots-out blood and worms from 
   her vagina before she dies. Hooke finds Gibbs and they take off in 
   their car, only to end up back at the motel and repeating the same 
   day all over again, but for some reason, only Hooke is aware of it. 
   Hooke pretends to be a coven member and witnesses one of the female 
   guests being impregnated by Gibbs. Benedict and his coven are waiting 
   for the perfect son of Satan to be born (they have a room full of 
   caged pregnant women who were once registered guests) so they can 
   leave this plane of existence, but they haven't been too successful, 
   as the babies being born are mutated or self-abort (hence the 
   blood-and-worms catastrophes). The whole motel is in some kind of 
   time warp and the motel staff spike the food and wine with an ash 
   that makes everyone live the same day over-and-over, with minor 
   differences. There's a portal somewhere down the road that will lead 
   everyone to safety, but can Hooke snap everyone from the spell they 
   are under and get them there before it all turns to shit? The 
   prerequisite &quot;surprise&quot; ending makes all of Hooke's hard 
   work a moot point.&nbsp; This low-budget horror film, directed by

   panache. There is a germ of a good idea here (Hooke and Gibbs have 
   been at the motel for over six months and are unknowingly raping all 
   the female guests in order to produce the perfect satanic baby), but 
   the film moves at such a lethargic pace and the paltry budget is 
   unable to convey the film's loftier ambitions. The acting is barely 
   OK and there are a few examples of gore (the blood and worms

   proficient film (still, that's not saying much). It's also got the 
   most complex plot of all his films, thanks to a fairly decent 
   screenplay by Michael Bockman and Gregg Tittinger. When cult leader 
   Reanhauer (Bill Roy) has a heart attack trying to raise a man from 
   the dead in the Nevada desert,<A HREF="possession_of_nurse_sherri_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/possession of nurse sherri vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="102" HEIGHT="194" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   he is rushed to the hospital and dies on the operating table. The 
   disembodied spirit (shown as a sickly green animated effect) enters 
   the body of Nurse Sherri (Jill Jacobson), which causes her to act 
   strangely, much to the concern of the hospital staff. Also in the 
   hospital is football star Marcus Washington (Prentiss Moulden), who 
   was recently blinded in a car accident and under the care of Nurse 
   Tara (Marilyn Joi). When the possessed Sherri sees Marcus in his bed, 
   she becomes fixated on his silver bracelet, a strange piece of 
   jewelry with two demon heads on it, a gift given to him by his late 
   voodoo priestess grandmother. Sherri first kills Dr. Nelson (Clayton 
   Foster), a hospital physician who lives on a farm. She shoves a 
   pitchfork through his back until the prongs protrude through his 
   stomach. Why did she kill him? Sherri's doctor boyfriend, Peter 
   (Geoffrey Land), becomes worried about her, especially when she 
   begins speaking in Reanhauer's voice. Peter puts the pieces together. 
   The possessed Sherri is killing all those who were in the operating 
   room when Reanhauer died. Meanwhile, Stevens (J.C. Wells), an old 
   colleague turned enemy of Reanhauer, is searching for Reanhauer's 
   grave so he can finally put Reanhauer to rest. The only problem is, 
   no one will tell him where he's buried. He gets into a car chase with 
   Peter (Adamson still uses the comical effect of tires squealing on 
   dirt roads, the same as he did in <B><A HREF="action.htm#Murder Gang">THE
    MURDER GANG</A></B>), but Reinhauer possesses the car and Stevens 
   barely escapes with his life. To make a long story short, Stevens 
   falls into a vat of molten steel after burning the wrong body, Sherri 
   continues killing hospital staff and Marcus gives Tara his bracelet 
   and tells her what she must do to save Sherri (go to the graveyard 
   and burn Reanhauer's body), while Peter runs around trying to figure 
   out what he can do. While the screenplay may be complex, Adamson's 
   execution of it is strictly low-rent. It's easy to spot the strings 
   on floating possessed objects and he still hasn't learned how to film 
   a car chase.&nbsp; Still, for a badfilm, it's pretty entertaining in 
   a cheesy way, thanks to the plentiful nudity (This is the

    POWER</A><A NAME="Power1983"></A> (1983) -</B> Once upon a time 
   there were four Aztec demons. Three of them died and the fourth one, 
   Destacatl, lives on in an idol so small, you can hold it in your 
   hand. The god Destacatl is said to control the dark side of the human 
   soul to whomever possesses the idol. So says Professor Wilson (Stan 
   Weston) in a lecture to his college class. When a student makes fun 
   of Weston's theories, we then see that Wilson has the idol in his 
   possession. He looks at the laughing student and makes his nose bleed 
   profusely. Class is over and Wilson is visited by fellow professor 
   Francis Lott (J. Dinan Myrtetus) and he wants to know if the idol has 
   taken over Wilson's soul yet. Wilson chases him away and the door 
   mysteriously closes and locks behind Francis. Wilson holds the idol, 
   screams in pain, floats in the air and is graphically impaled on a 
   flag pole. Francis and the janitor manage to break open the door and 
   when Francis asks Wilson<A HREF="power_1984.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/power 1983 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="264" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   where the idol is, Wilson says with his last dying breath, &quot;I 
   sent it back.&quot; (His hand that was holding the idol is now bloody 
   and burned). Francis heads off to Mexico in a Jeep with a 
   Spanish-speaking driver (this part of the film is subtitled). They 
   travel 200 miles into the Mexican desert and has his driver drop him 
   off in the middle of nowhere (holding nothing but a briefcase). 
   Francis hands the driver a bunch of money and tells him to pick him 
   up tomorrow morning, where the driver (Juan del Valle) says, &quot;I 
   don't think you'll be alive tomorrow.&quot; and drives off. That 
   night, a young boy leads Francis to a tent, where an old Spanish man 
   resides. He has the boy get the idol (The old guy tells Francis that 
   the idol doesn't affect children since they still haven't lost their 
   innocence), places a crucifix around his neck and hands Francis the 
   idol. Francis holds the idol in his hand and says that he can feel 
   its power, to which the old man says, &quot;Yes, it's very alluring. 
   That's the secret of its evil.&quot; The old man refuses to sell the 
   idol to Francis, so he shoots and kills the old man and the young 
   boy. Francis starts screaming in pain with blood flowing down his 
   arm, as he drops the idol. Cut to high school students Julie (Lisa 
   Erickson), Matt (Ben Gilbert) and Tommy (Chad Christian), as they 
   plan on holding a seance that night (&quot;There's even a full 
   moon!&quot;). They all sneak out of their houses that night holding 
   something dear to them for protection from the spirits. They hold the 
   seance at an old cemetery in a building where tombstones are made and 
   put an ouija board on the ground, placing their personal protection 
   pieces next to them. Tommy's piece just happens to be the idol of 
   Destacatl, which he says his parents brought back from a trip. As 
   they all place their hands on the planchette, it spells out 
   &quot;GO&quot; and they all beat a hasty retreat out of the cemetery. 
   The cemetery guard (Richard Congill) hears the commotion and goes 
   inside the building to find out what is going on, only to have his 
   head crushed by a stone casket (a very good effect). When they read 
   in the newspapers that a cemetery guard was killed in the same 
   building that they were in, mixed with Tommy nearly getting killed 
   when the idol goes full-tilt weird in his bedroom (It acts like a 
   magnet, drawing objects to it, tossing other objects in the air, 
   boiling the fishtank water and setting fire to speakers, Tommy 
   cowering in a corner with only a boogie board as his protection), 
   they all go to tabloid reporter Sandy (Susan Stokey; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#StarSlammer1986">STAR
    SLAMMER</A></B> - 1986; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#PhantomEmpire1987">THE
    PHANTOM EMPIRE</A></B> - 1987) to tell their stories, but she blows 
   them off as childish pranksters. Sandy's 
   ex-boyfriend-turned-just-plain-friend Jerry (Warren Lincoln; <B><A HREF="torment_1985.htm">TORMENT</A></B> 
   - 1985; co-directed by this film's production manager, Samson 
   Aslanian, and assistant director, John Hopkins), who is paying Sandy 
   a short visit before traveling to London, believes the kids and 
   become the possessor of the idol. Uh-oh. Jerry tries to find the 
   origins of the idol, but the idol begins to get the best of him. 
   Sandy has a bad nightmare where hands and arms spring out of her 
   mattress, pinning her to the bed (a very effective scene) and when 
   she wakes up, she discovers all the furniture has been stacked upon 
   each other (ala <B><A HREF="poltergeist_1982.htm">POLTERGEIST</A></B> 
   - 1982) and there's a fork impaled in one of her walls. Jerry blames 
   the idol, but Sandy refuses to believe in such bunk (she been making 
   up stories like that for her tabloid for years and wants to become a 
   legitimate journalist) and she becomes even more pissed-off when 
   Jerry brings the three teens to her boss, Marty (Gabe Cohen), who 
   believes it's a great story (with further untrue enhancements, that 
   is). It's not long before Jerry becomes full-blown possessed himself, 
   his face and body becoming an ugly demon whose only reason to exist 
   is to kill. He first kills Sandy's friend and co-worker Roxanne 
   (Alice Champlin) by shoving her hand down a garbage disposal and then 
   heads off to the house of Sandy's father (Rod Mays), who never liked 
   Jerry to begin with. It's quite obvious that he has killed Sandy's 
   father when Sandy arrives at her father's house (Jerry makes up a 
   story that her father had a heart attack and was taken away by an 
   ambulance, but the story just doesn't gel in Sandy's mind). Jerry 
   cuts the phone line and turns once again into a demon, showing Sandy 
   how slicing open his arm causes him no pain. Our three teenagers try 
   to save Sandy, but Julie becomes trapped in the house with Sandy. 
   Tommy and Matt sneak into the house through a basement window, where 
   they discover the corpse of Sandy's father and scream. Their screams 
   distract the demon Jerry long enough for Julie to grab the idol and 
   become trapped in a tool closet with Sandy, as the possessed Jerry 
   begins tearing down the door to get them. They discover that if the 
   idol is smashed, it affects Jerry, so Sandy drops a cinderblock on 
   it, breaking the idol into pieces, as the demon Jerry's skin begins 
   to split wide open (another excellent effect). Three years pass and 
   now Julie is a college student in <A HREF="power_1984.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/power 1984 dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="193" HEIGHT="271" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>New
    Mexico working at the facility's library. As she is closing for the 
   night, a disfigured Francis (Remember him?) confronts her about her 
   ordeal and says he was able to find her because of Sandy's book 
   (Seems Sandy wrote a best-seller about her experience with the 
   supernatural.). Julie runs to her car crying and when Francis follows 
   her to say he is sorry, we then realize that Julie is possessed by 
   Destacatl, as she is wearing the broken head of the idol around her 
   neck like a necklace. She kills Francis and the demon Julie laughs at 
   the camera. Destacatl lives. This tidy little 84 minute horror film 
   was directed, written and edited by the team of Jeffrey Obrow and

   produced it), who also gave us <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Dorm Dripped Blood">THE

   (2011 - Present). Of the three films they made together, I would put 
   this film last on their list, not because it's a bad film, but 
   because the other two films had more meat on the bone. This is an 
   ever-so-thin story that really has no narrative (Like: How did the 
   other three Aztec demons die, yet Destacatl keeps on chugging along, 
   seemingly indestructible? How did Tommy's parents get the idol since 
   Francis had to jump through hoops just to see it? Why do Tommy's 
   parents talk to him through an intercom in his bedroom rather than 
   come up and see him in person [we never see Julie or Matt's 
   parents]?). It is nothing but a collection of loose ideas highlighted 
   by Matthew Mungle's (<B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#JustBeforeDawn1980">JUST

   in films and on TV) excellent gore and makeup effects. The acting in 
   this film also leaves something to be desired (80% of the cast never 
   went on to do another film and it's easy to see why), as there are no 
   name actors besides Susan Stokey, who had a short career in cheap 
   exploitation films. Still, at 84 minutes, it moves rather quickly and 
   the excellent gore effects will hold your attention and hopefully 
   make you forget the story's gaping plot holes. It's neither good or 
   bad. It's just an ordinary early-80's horror flick with a few good 
   effects and some nice desert scenery to get you by. Also starring 
   Chris Morrill, Jay Fisher, Costy Basile, James Gilchrist, Barbara 
   Murray, Jake Jones and Milton Robinson. Originally released

   lab on the rig. Alex (Craig Fairbrass), the leader of the six 
   survivors, finds weapons on the rig and, when they find the lab, he 
   realizes that this rig hasn't been used for oil in quite some time. 
   With the rig's radio out of commission (no surprise there), the 
   ragtag group must find a way off the rig before they become fodder 
   for the creature. Paul (Robert Firth) is the first member of the 
   group to be attacked by the creature and when Alex and the rest go 
   looking for him, they run into the unfriendly Dr. Shelley (Nigel 
   Pegram) and the hysterical Dr. Carol Soames (Jordan Page). It's plain 
   to see that something is wrong with both of them, because on two 
   separate occasions, they throw the beefy Alex around as if he were 
   light as a feather (and it doesn't help Alex's confidence at all). 
   They also run into Buckley (Ricco Ross), the rig's head of security, 
   who informs them that the <A HREF="proteus_1995.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/proteus vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="139" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>creature's
    name is &quot;Charlie&quot;, the creation of a new man-made DNA 
   strain called &quot;Proteus&quot;. Charlie is able to shape-shift 
   into the form of any living object it comes in contact with and it 
   becomes clear to the group that it can take human form when Buckley 
   turns into the creature and infects Rachel (Jennifer Calvert). The 
   creature starts infecting the rest of the group until only Alex and 
   Linda (Toni Barry) are left. Alex reveals to Linda that he and Rachel 
   are actually DEA agents sent to infiltrate the gang. That doesn't 
   make much of a difference now, as Alex and Linda have to find a way 
   to blow up the rig and send the creature to the bottom of the ocean, 
   but things take a left-hand turn when the rig's owner, Leonard 
   Brinkstone (Doug 'Pinhead' Bradley, under a ton of bad old-age 
   makeup), shows up with a security force to find out what's going on. 
   Charlie, who is now hopelessly addicted to heroin (thanks to 
   &quot;absorbing&quot; junkie Mark [William Marsh]), now has two 
   things on it's mind: Finding a way off the rig so it can absorb more 
   humans (and gain more intelligence) and finding more heroin for it's 
   next fix. What hath man wrought?&nbsp; The best way to describe this 
   film is with one word: Average. Reminiscent of countless films before 
   it (the TV movie <B><A HREF="intruder_within_1981.htm">THE INTRUDER WITHIN</A></B> 
   [1981] and nearly every <B><A HREF="alien_1979c.htm">ALIEN</A></B> 
   clone), <B><A HREF="proteus_1995b.htm">PROTEUS</A></B> contains 
   nothing that could be considered remotely original or contributes 
   anything new to the genre, just countless distorted creature POV 
   shots and people running endlessly up and down the rig's narrow 
   corridors trying to escape from the creature. The film takes a sudden 
   turn into <B><A HREF="thing_1982.htm">THE THING</A></B> territory 
   (John Carpenter's 1982 version) when it is revealed that the creature 
   can take human form but, unlike the tension in Carpenter's film in

    attempts to hide the creature's identity. Instead, it offers cheap 
   jump-scares, a few lame transformation scenes and some cheap gore. 
   Since this film was directed by special effects and makeup master Bob 
   Keen (<B><A HREF="hellraiser_1987.htm">HELLRAISER</A></B> - 1987; <B><A HREF="candyman_1992.htm">CANDYMAN</A></B>

   haphazard morphing scenes, must fall squarely on his shoulders. Keen 
   hasn't been very successful as a director. If you've seen his family 
   film <B><A HREF="to_catch_a_yeti_1995.htm">TO CATCH A YETI</A></B>

   later films, thanks to his refusal to alter his thick Cockney accent. 
   Too bad. He was built like a brick shithouse and had great comic 
   timing. The only enjoyable moment in the whole film is in the finale, 
   when Charlie reveals his true form (a ridiculous animatronic creature 
   with the head of a shark and a tentacled body) and says to Alex how 
   superior it is to humans. Fairbrass looks at the creature and says, 
   &quot;Superior? You're a fucking fish with a drug habit!&quot; I must 
   admit I had a chuckle with that one. All-in-all, <B>PROTEUS</B> is

   annual fishing trip during the dance, or B: the wheelchair-bound 
   veteran (Lawrence Tierney) who keeps a watchful eye on a house full 
   of co-eds? It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that the sheriff 
   is the killer, but that's not the point. The true point for watching 
   this film are Zito's suspenseful setups and Savini's masterful 
   effects. There's the infamous bayonet through the top of the head 
   scene, various throat slashings and pitchfork impalements and, 
   finally, the movie's best-known scene, where <A HREF="prowler_head_explosion.htm">Farley

   easy to see that there's definitely a stand-in portraying Farley as 
   the killer. Don't let that detract you from going out and purchasing 
   this DVD. You'll probably never see a better looking copy of this 
   film (also known as <B><A HREF="rosemarys_killer.htm">ROSEMARY'S KILLER</A></B>)

   deserves to be in any true horror fan's collection. While I'm on the 
   subject on things little-known, let talk a little about director 
   Joseph Zito. This guy has gotten such a short-shrift from critics for 
   nearly every film he has directed. I find his style to be quite 
   refreshing, especially his action sequences. On of my favorite action 
   films is his <B><A HREF="invasion_usa_1985.htm">INVASION U.S.A.</A></B> 
   (1985), which seems more relevant today than when it was made. It's 
   probably the best film Chuck Norris has ever made (Zito also directed 
   him in <B><A HREF="missing_in_action_1984.htm">MISSING IN ACTION</A></B> 
   - 1984) and is action-packed from start to finish. It's just plain 
   nasty. You have to love a film where terrorists attach a bomb to a 
   traveling school bus filled with kids, an all-out crash and burn 
   shoot-out in a mall full of Christmas shoppers and Chuck and Richard 
   Lynch's knock-down, drag-out finale. They don't get much better than 
   this, even if critics were unanimous in putting it down when 
   originally released. Avoid watching this film on regular TV, as TBS 
   and TNT (who I give props for showing it a couple of days after the 
   terrorist attacks of 9/11) cut the shit out of it. Zito also directed

   profession than a brawling wrestler. Until you see this film, that 
   is. The film starts with one of the most anemically populated 
   wrestling shows in recent <A HREF="pro_wrestlers_vs_zombies_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/pro wrestlers vs. zombies dvd front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>memory
    (it's apparent that it was filmed at a high school gymnasium because 
   you can see the basketball backboards in the &quot;up&quot; position) 
   and there's an on-screen scrawl that says &quot;The ring is the only 
   place you can kill a man and get away with it.&quot; (Vince McMahon 
   knows a lot about that). I knew right then and there that I was in 
   for a spectacularly bad experience (And I was right). We see some 
   wrestling matches that make TNT Wrestling look like Wrestlemania. 
   There are no words in the dictionary to describe how badly this film 
   sucked (This is where I would insert in a Hoover or Dyson joke 
   reference, but those companies don't deserve it in a film like this). 
   After a wrestler named Billy (Michael H. Richmond) is killed in the 
   ring by &quot;The Franchise&quot; Shane Douglas (playing himself; 
   most A and B-Class wrestlers play themselves) populated sparsely by 
   about 30 people (&quot;Oh my God, Billy's dead!), we see Billy's 
   sinister brother Angus (Ashton Amherst) throw a big pile of money in 
   front of wrestling promoter Cody (played by the director, Cody 
   Knotts) and says he wants Shane Douglas and his girlfriend Taya 
   Parker (famous female wrestler) for a special wrestling show he has 
   planned at an abandoned penitentiary. Cody says for this amount of 
   money, he can also get Angus other wrestlers, including Rowdy Roddy 
   Piper, &quot;Hacksaw&quot; Jim Duggan, Matt Hardy, and his girlfriend 
   Reba Skye (another famous female wrestler) and lots of lesser-known 
   wrestlers. Cody says he can even deliver Olympic champion Kurt Angle, 
   but Angus says to make Angle's entrance a surprise and have him enter 
   through the side door (Wait a minute. Penitentiaries have side 
   doors?). A nurse is then kidnapped by Angus' disciples (this happens 
   right after the mirror in her compact shatters and we hear grunting 
   and see a puff of dark smoke through the mirror shards). We then see 
   her tied to the floor with lit candles all around her and duct tape 
   over her mouth (Ah, duct tape. A killers best friend!). Angus puts on 
   a plastic hoodie, takes a look at a photo of his brother Billy and 
   then uses a dagger to cut open her chest,&nbsp; remove her 
   still-beating heart with his bare hands and then eats it. We then 
   hear that growl again and see that puff of dark smoke, as a demon 
   (most probably Satan himself) tells Angus that he can now get revenge 
   for the death of Billy (The heartless nurse gets up and acts like 
   Angus' lap dog. WTF?). In a scene that makes zero sense, two second 
   rate wrestlers enter Angus' home and the heartless nurse bites them, 
   instantly turning them into zombies. We then see Shane Douglas having 
   breakfast with his mother, brother, sister-in-law and his favorite, 
   nephew Nicky (Drew Ripepi). Shane takes Nicky outside, where they 
   talk, and when Cody returns to the inside of the house, he finds all 
   the furniture overturned with the heartless nurse turning the rest of 
   the family into zombies and she carries Nicky away. Shane then goes 
   to his manager, Cody (Where Shane gets a dig into Vince McMahon for 
   bouncing paychecks), and wants to know about this latest match and, 
   especially, when he will get paid (Hey, what about his missing 
   family?). Cody tells him he will get all the money, including the 
   back pay owed to him, when he boards the bus tomorrow for the 
   deserted West Virginia penitentiary. Shane runs into Roddy outside 
   the building signing autographs for his young fans and Shane 
   discovers that Roddy and a whole bunch of other wrestlers will be on 
   the bus with him tomorrow. After they all take the bus ride and make 
   it to the penitentiary, a man hops on board and tells them that 
   whomever wins their matches will find much fortune and then makes 
   them all turn over their cell phones to him (right then and there, I 
   would have jumped off the bus and run away!). They turn over their 
   cell phones with very little pressure. &quot;Hacksaw&quot; Jim Duggan 
   (who looks horrible) is already there and Kurt Angle is attacked by 
   zombies at the side entrance (He grabs one zombie by his foot and it 
   falls off!). He quickly becomes zombie chow after his three minute 
   cameo. Without any exposition, the zombies have Shane, Roddy and 
   Hacksaw trapped in the ring, when Angus shows Shane he has Nicky. All 
   the non-zombie wrestlers run through the prison and are picked off 
   one-by-one by the horde of zombies (Matt Hardy is torn in half. 
   Hacksaw Jim Duggan and his bloody two by four becomes zombie jerky 
   after Shane locks the door behind him and refuses to let Hacksaw in). 
   Seems like Shane is holding some deadly secrets, as he sacrifices his 
   fellow wrestlers to stay alive. Shane killed Billy because he was 
   screwing Taya Parker, which is why Angus wants them both dead (I do 
   have to say that some of Shane's actions during this film deserves 
   some bloody punishment). Angus has Shane surrounded by zombies, while 
   Roddy and non-wrestler Sarah (Adrienne Fischer) try to avoid them. 
   Angus cuts out another heart and eats it, so Roddy, Sarah and Shane 
   escape outside. Angus tells Roddy, &quot;This is only the 
   beginning!&quot; to which Roddy retorts, &quot;I beat cancer. This is 
   nothing!&quot; (Roddy really did beat cancer.). After Roddy and Sarah 
   kill a few dozen zombies, Angus yells out, &quot;I need more 
   power!&quot;, to which the demon replies, &quot;Granted!&quot; 
   Corpses come crawling out of their graves and Roddy is attacked by a 
   pack of the living dead, but Sarah saves him with her machete, 
   putting her life in mortal danger. Shane catches up with Roddy &amp; 
   Sarah, where he is attacked by his zombified brother Troy (Cody 
   Michael) and then by zombie Nicky. Shane kills<A HREF="pro_wrestlers_vs_zombies_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/pro wrestlers vs. zombies poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="186" HEIGHT="267" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   them both, but he asks Roddy to kill his zombified mother , which 
   Roddy does. Angus chains Shane's neck to a pole and slowly begins to 
   choke him while zombies enjoy a meal of his innards. Sarah gets 
   bitten in the neck by a zombie, but, for some unknown reason, the 
   demon starts yelling in pain and all the zombies drop dead. Roddy and 
   Angus get into a fight and Roddy wins (with the American flag as a 
   backdrop, no less!). Turns out with the demon dying, Sarah will not 
   turn into a zombie, so they both live happily ever after. At least 
   Angus got his wish, but he put way too much work into it. Wouldn't it 
   have been cheaper or easier just to hire a hitman to take both Shane 
   and Taya out? I guess we wouldn't have this shitty movie then, 
   right?&nbsp; Besides using real-life wrestlers (wrestling is nothing 
   but acting anyway, which is why there are so many 
   wrestlers-turned-actors) and some over-the-top gore (a zombie 
   snapping in two when Matt Hardy lifts him over his head; a head 
   crushed in a refrigerator door; machete impalements; appendages torn 
   off bodies; intestine eating; heart removals; etc.), there is very 
   little to recommend here unless you are a gorehound. Hacksaw Jim 
   Duggan looks simply terrible and his face is hardly shown, so it 
   wouldn't surprise me if they used a stunt double in many of his 
   scenes. The story is all over the place (especially Shane's 
   temperament) and none of it makes a lick of sense; it's just an 
   excuse to get some wrestlers to fight some cheesy-looking zombies. It 
   sounds to the human ear that Roddy was improvising most of his lines 
   because the ones that were given him in the script weren't very good. 
   Roddy's the best thing about this film, but director/screenwriter/actor/co-producer
    Cody Knotts (<B><A HREF="lucifers_unholy_desire_2011.htm">LUCIFER'S 
   UNHOLY DESIRE</A></B> - 2011; <B><A HREF="breeding_farm_2012.htm">BREEDING
    FARM</A></B> - 2012) does nearly everything wrong and seems 
   determined to sabotage this film with his lousy filmmaking technique. 
   Especially disturbing is how Shane is portrayed. He seems highly 
   schizophrenic. We are shown him being a loving family man and then 
   saying that he loved killing Billy in the ring. Most people like this 
   spend their lives in rubber rooms (or getting eaten by zombies). 
   Well, at least he got his dig into Vince McMahon. I'm willing to bet 
   McMahon was pissed when he heard what Shane said, but the fact that 
   Shane wasn't sued probably makes what he said about Vince true. 
   Otherwise the film makes no sense unless you want to see real-life 
   wrestlers (some way past their prime) get eaten by or destroy 
   zombies. Not a recommendation, though. Also starring 
   &quot;Facade&quot; Michael Cichowicz, Matthew Rush, Thomas Rodman,

   where Arnold meets Emilio (Stack Pierce; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Transformed2003">TRANSFORMED</A></B> 
   - 2003), who stands by a fence on the hospital's roof and tells 
   Arnold that he &quot;is waiting for a train&quot; (It is probably the 
   film's most emotional moment) as an AmTrack train passes below them. 
   Arnold declares his innocence to Emilio, telling him how his mother 
   got sick, but because he didn't have the money, the doctors wouldn't 
   operate on her to save her life. He wanted to sell his mother's old 
   home, but she wouldn't allow it and when one of the doctors ended up 
   murdered, Arnold was convicted of murder but judged mentally unfit to 
   serve jail time. Emilio, on the other hand, professes his guilt and 
   tells Arnold that he murdered his daughter because she became a drug 
   addict and sullied the family name. He also tells Arnold that once he 
   kills his daughter's drug dealer (he plans on slitting his throat), 
   he will give Arnold a chance to leave the institution for good. One 
   night, Arnold watches as Emilio uses an amulet to go into some kind 
   of a trance and the next morning, he tells Arnold that he now has to 
   &quot;catch that train&quot;, so Emilio climbs over the fence and 
   jumps to his death while an AmTrack train passes. Emilio leaves 
   Arnold all his possessions, including the amulet and a letter that 
   was just delivered that morning that is nothing but a newspaper 
   clipping that says a drug dealer was murdered by having his throat 
   cut from ear-to-ear last night. Arnold then knows that Emilio was 
   able to leave his body by using the amulet and tries it on himself. A 
   hospital orderly finds Arnold on the floor and he is declared dead 
   and brought to the morgue for an autopsy. When the coroner begins to 
   make an incision into Arnold's chest, he suddenly wakes up and the 
   hospital's head doctor (Rod Cameron) tells Laura that if this news 
   gets out (that they tried to autopsy a live person), their hospital 
   will be closed down. Luckily for Arnold (and the hospital) the real 
   person who committed the murder blamed on Arnold confessed, which 
   makes Arnold a free man. He heads for his mother's old house, which 
   is full of cobwebs and has a nice white kitty as a resident. The cat 
   actually gives Arnold the idea of using the power he now has of 
   leaving his body (known as &quot;Astral Projection&quot; or having an 
   &quot;Out Of Body&quot; experience [or OOB]) and getting even with 
   those responsible for his mother's death. His first victim is Dr. 
   Paul Taylor (Whit Bissell; <B><A HREF="i_was_a_teenage_frankenstein_1957.htm">I
    WAS A TEENAGE FRANKENSTEIN</A></B> - 1957), the doctor that refused 
   to give his mother the life-saving operation without being paid 
   first. The sleazy old doctor brings a married woman to his cabin in 
   the woods for some nookie, but Arnold talks throughout the entire 
   ordeal and only Dr. Taylor can hear it. It drives the doctor crazy 
   and he goes outside with a shotgun. We hear one shell being fired and 
   then Dr. Taylor is found dead with a broken neck. The detective on 
   the case, Lt. Jeff Morgan (Paul Burke; <B><A HREF="disembodied_1957.htm">THE
    DISEMBODIED</A></B> - 1957), is stymied by the case because it is 
   obvious the nervous married woman doesn't have the strength to snap a 
   neck. Arnold's next victim is his mother's uncaring Nurse Burdon 
   (Mary Wilcox; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#LoveMeDeadly1972">LOVE 
   ME DEADLY</A></B> - 1972; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#BlackOakConspiracy">BLACK
    OAK CONSPIRACY</A></B> - 1977), who we see sexually teasing a 
   terminal patient in his own home, before doing a striptease and 
   taking a shower. It will be the last shower of her life because the 
   shower head begins to emit scalding water (and turns in her direction 
   so she cannot avoid it) and the nurse is unable to get out of the 
   shower until she crashes through the glass shower door. Again Jeff 
   and his partner, Lt. Dave Anderson (Aldo Ray; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#TerrorOnAlcatraz">TERROR
    ON ALCATRAZ</A></B> - 1987) are flummoxed, as the apartment 
   building's hot water heater is incapable of reaching scalding 
   temperatures. Jeff sends Police Sgt. Marv Sowash (filmmaker Greydon 
   Clark, who co-wrote this film with Danton and genre vet Mikel Angel) 
   to the scene of the first crime to see if he can find something that 
   the crime scene investigators missed. Jeff doesn't realize that Marv 
   was Arnold's arresting officer and his next victim, as Arnold takes 
   control of his car and drives it off a cliff, killing Marv. When Jeff 
   interrogates a motorcycle cop (Marland Proctor) who was chasing Marv 
   for speeding, the cop tells Jeff that he could swear he heard Marv 
   say &quot;Help me!&quot;. Now that there are three unexplained 
   deaths, Jeff makes the connection of all the deaths with Arnold and 
   keeps a close eye on him and his house by telescope at a house 
   located across the street. Laura also joins Jeff because she is 
   deeply concerned about Arnold and they both spy on him going into 
   such a deep sleep that even continued phone calls don't wake him up 
   (Arnold is actually murdering construction tycoon Harvey B. Sanders 
   [Joseph Della Sorte], who wanted to tear down his mother's house, by 
   dropping a heavy cornerstone on his body using a crane.). It's not 
   long before Laura and Jeff become lovers and sleep together at Jeff's 
   house. It is there that Laura spots Arnold in the kitchen (who has 
   left his body once again), who tells Laura that he watched Laura and 
   Jeff making love and he wishes that it was him instead. When Jeff 
   enters the kitchen, Arnold disappears and Laura tells Jeff that they 
   need to see an old friend of hers, Dr. Gubner (Nehemiah Persoff; <B><A HREF="power_1968.htm">THE
    POWER</A></B> - 1968), who is an expert on Kirlian Photography and 
   how some humans are able to let their energies leave their bodies to 
   have Out Of Body experiences. Jeff, Laura, and Dr. Grubner go to Arnold's<A HREF="psychic_killer_1975.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/psychic killer dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="182" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   house, where they discover he is in another trance (a trance that 
   actually makes the body look dead). Arnold is actually out killing 
   crooked butcher Lemonowski (Neville Brand; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Mad Bomber">THE
    MAD BOMBER</A></B> - 1972) for charging too much for his meat (and 
   putting his hand on the scale)! Lemonowski then is forced to put his 
   hand in a meat grinder (the film's bloodiest effect), has his arms 
   tenderized and then has all his appendages cut off by a band saw 
   (offscreen). When Jeff, Laura and Dr. Grubner make it to Lemonowski's 
   butcher shop (thanks to a police radio report), they find the torso 
   of Lemonowski hanging on a meat hook. Jeff comes up with a brilliant 
   idea on how to stop Arnold: The next time he goes into one of his 
   trances (which he does, to take Laura sexually by force), he will 
   have a doctor next to Arnold's body to sign a death certificate and 
   then his lifeless body will be transported to the nearest crematorium 
   to be burned. That's exactly what Jeff does, and as Arnold's body is 
   being burned alive, the non-corporeal Arnold (who is rapidly 
   deteriorating because of the fire) appears to Laura to say one final 
   thing: &quot;Everything I love dies!&quot;&nbsp; For a film that was 
   Rated PG (this is the 70's version of PG, not the watered-down 
   version of today), this film is very violent in spots (without 
   actually being bloody or gory) and is not shy in showing Mary 
   Wilcox's nipples and naked ass more than a few times when she is 
   taking a shower. The film is never boring and is chock-full of stars 
   familiar to fans of the horror genre (the majority of them are no 
   longer with us) and is a perfectly fine way to spend 90 minutes of 
   your time. Jim Hutton (who died at age 49 in 1979) is rather low-key, 
   but effective, and everyone else does a more than adequate job in the 
   acting department. The final shot (of the cat with the amulet) left 
   this film wide open for a sequel (Could Arnold have transferred his 
   energy into the cat?), but it never happened. That's a shame, because 
   this film is a nice relic from the 70's, when any plot device could 
   be used effectively without seeming corny. Highly recommended. Also 
   starring Della Reese (in a funny cameo where she argues with 
   Lemonowski about his meat practices and accepting Food Stamps), 
   Judith Brown, John Dennis, Bill Quinn and Sandra Rustam (daughter of 
   producer Mardi Rustam, who directed the bad film <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Evils of the Night">EVILS

   be seen, buy the DVD from <A HREF="http://www.darkskyfilms.com">Dark 
   Sky Films</A> and watch it in all its widescreen anamorphic glory. 
   It's short on extras (just some TV spots and the theatrical trailer), 
   but it is a beautiful print that hasn't been washed away of grain. 
   Don't let the PG Rating fool you, this is adult stuff. <B>Rated PG</B>.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   This odd Canadian horror film is narrated by a detective writer as if 
   he were living in the 40's, which is unsettling, especially when he 
   speaks the slang with his Canadian accent. In October of 1966, Sarah, 
   a six year-old girl, spikes her parents' anniversary breakfast with 
   rat poison, killing them. She is put in a mental institution and, on 
   her 25th birthday, escapes. Her first stop is to the house of her 
   psychiatrist, who she ties to his bed and cuts his head off. Victoria 
   (Agi Gallus), Sarah's sister, works for novelist Richard Foster (John 
   Haslett Cuff, our narrator) as a cook, when she begins to get phone 
   calls from Sarah, goading Victoria into meeting her at an abandoned 
   mental hospital. It turns out it was Victoria that poisoned their 
   parents, not Sarah, but the years spent in the looney bin have 
   definitely twisted Sarah's mind. The sisters get into a deadly fight 
   and Sarah wins. Richard and his wife, Diane (Rose Graham), are having 
   a <A HREF="psycho_girls_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/psycho girls vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="138" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>big
    anniversary party and Victoria is supposed to cook the dinner, but 
   when Sarah (Darlene Mignacco) shows up instead, Richard is at first 
   hesitant to let her cook, but the hunger pains in his stomach relents 
   and he lets her make dinner. During the course of the dinner party, 
   questions will be answered, food will be served (including steak 
   tartar) and people will be killed. Sarah has drugged the tartar and 
   has dragged all the unconscious guests to the abandoned mental 
   hospital, where she and a couple of other escaped loonies, tie all 
   the guests to chairs arranged in a semi-circle and perform a ceremony 
   where they worship a giant photo of Sigmund Freud and begin 
   butchering the guests one-by-one (and order a pizza in the middle of 
   the carnage!).&nbsp; One guy is strapped to a barber's chair, given a 
   shave with a straight razor and then has his throat cut. A woman is 
   stripped naked, put in a tub of water and is electrocuted until her 
   body catches fire. More are tortured and killed until the tables are 
   turned (and then turned again). What's the point of it all? I'm still 
   trying to figure that out.&nbsp; The movie sounds much better than it 
   actually is. The main problem is that most of the grisly murders are 
   edited to the point of being meaningless (probably done so to achieve 
   an R rating). There is plenty of nudity on view but, just when the 
   killings are about to get interesting, there are huge jump cuts, 
   especially in the beheading, shaving and electrocution segments.&nbsp;
    This is Gerard Ciccoritti's first effort and it is rather drab and 
   colorless, nothing like his later vampire cab driver opus <B><A HREF="graveyard_shift_1987.htm">GRAVEYARD
    SHIFT</A></B> (1987) and <B><A HREF="understudy_graveyard_shift_2_1988.htm">THE
    UNDERSTUDY: GRAVEYARD SHIFT II</A></B> (1988), which were both 
   neon-drenched in atmosphere and highly entertaining. He later went on 
   to direct a lot of Canadian episodic TV, using the name Jerry 
   Ciccoritti. I don't know what Ciccoritti was thinking when he put the 
   40's detective element in the script (co-written with producer 
   Michael Bockner), but it is a distraction and seems totally 
   unnecessary, since it does nothing to advance the plot (except for a 
   lame &quot;surprise&quot; at the end). The acting is uniformly 
   terrible (one of the crazies has a fondness for quoting Al Pacino in <B><A HREF="scarface_1983.htm">SCARFACE</A></B> 
   - 1982) and there's lots of annoying post-synch dubbing. The ending,

   example of a horror film with a social conscience. Mr. Rabbey (Tom 
   Basham), the host of a local children&#146;s TV show, does more than 
   entertain the kids. He also protects them by killing their abusive 
   parents. While performing at a hospital child ward, Rabbey overhears 
   a cop (Jackson Bostwick, who also executive produced) explaining to a 
   nurse (Margaret Avery) how difficult it is to prosecute child 
   abusers. Rabbey steals some hospital records on suspected child 
   abusers and dishes out his own brand of justice. Riding his bike (he 
   has no drivers license) to various households, we witness Rabbey use 
   baseball bats, strangulation, knives and an electric lawn mower (!) 
   on his victims as we learn that he was also abused as a child, which 
   makes the murders all the more digestible. In the end, it is not the 
   police but a child who puts an end to Rabbey&#146;s killings. She 
   shoots him as he is about to kill her abusive mother and then turns 
   the gun on Mom. A truly chilling scene. This film works in many ways, 
   thanks to a literate screenplay (by Walter Dallenbach) and tight

   before, all the doctor can do is shake his head in disbelief. Rocky 
   soon discovers that when he gets these headaches, he is able to 
   telekinetically move objects with his mind. Rocky drives to the spot 
   where he had his strange experience and meets an old man (Bob 
   McDonald), who tells him that some mighty weird things have been 
   happening in the area. Rocky goes to the old man's shack for a cup of 
   coffee, gets one of his headaches and accidentally kills the old man 
   by telekinetically embedding him in one of the shack's walls. Police 
   Lt. Walter O'Brien (Christopher Carbis) and Sgt. Chuck Jackson (Curt 
   Colbert) are assigned to investigate the old man's murder and find a 
   clue: Rocky's barber jacket. There's also a tall, well-dressed man 
   who also seems interested in the case. Rocky's doctor phones the 
   police because he believes that Rocky is involved in the murder, but 
   Rocky shows up at his office and kills the doctor by throwing him out 
   the window to the street below by just using his mind. Lt. O'Brien is 
   stumped when he examined the doctor's office because it looks like a 
   war zone, with every object in the room looking like it exploded, but 
   he does manage to find Rocky's medical records and the chase is on. 
   Rocky heads to a bar to get drunk, where he meets co-worker Kathy 
   (Robin Newton), and she asks him, &quot;Is your head in the 
   clouds?&quot; to which Rocky retorts, &quot;What did you mean by 
   that?&quot; Kathy takes Rocky to her pad, where they make love (He's 
   been cheating on his wife for several years), while Lt. O'Brien 
   interviews Rocky's wife at his house. After Rocky nearly kills his 
   wife with his special powers, he leads the cops on a car chase, then 
   a foot chase, through the streets of Chicago, finally ending on the 
   roof of a building, where Rocky kills some cops with his mind before 
   seemingly being killed by a sniper's bullet. So why can't the police 
   find his body?&nbsp; This snail-paced, erratically acted horror film 
   was directed by Jack M. Sell (<B><A HREF="outtakes_1987.htm">OUTTAKES</A></B> 
   - 1987; <B><A HREF="deadly_spygames_1989.htm">DEADLY SPYGAMES</A></B> 
   - 1989), who also co-wrote, edited and photographed this regional 
   wonder. Sell utilizes fisheye lenses, quick editing and slow-motion 
   photography when Rocky uses his psychotronic powers, but the rest of 
   the film is bogged-down by the minutiae, as Sell slowly lingers the 
   camera on such things as cutting hair, putting a key in a car's 
   ignition and turning it on, playing with the knobs of a car radio and 
   other such trivialities of life. There's also a lengthy car chase 
   where nothing happens except long scenes of cops talking on their 
   radios. It's truly a chore to sit through <B>THE PSYCHOTRONIC MAN</B> 
   because the violence level is low, there is no sex or foul language 
   and Rocky's sudden powers are never fully explained (Was it a UFO? 
   Was it something supernatural? I have no clue!). There are some great 
   shots of 70's Chicago, but it's just not enough to maintain interest. 
   Historically, this film is important, but it's not very entertaining.

   Oh, great. Another horror film set during Halloween. One year ago on 
   Halloween Night, Jonathan Starks (Michael Zara) saves his sister Lynn 
   (Amy Weber) when a pumpkin-masked killer attacks her in the attic of 
   their house. As Jonathan is stabbing the killer to death, the pumpkin 
   mask falls off, revealing the killer to be Lynn's obnoxious boyfriend 
   Alec (David Wright), who was just playing a (totally unfunny) 
   practical joke on his girlfriend. He pays for it with his life. 
   Exactly one year later, Jonathan and Lynn move to Carver, California 
   (a small farming town) and we meet the rest of the young cast (yes, 
   it's another &quot;teens in peril&quot; flick), including Jonathan's 
   newest love interest, Tammy (Minka Kelly), and her angry ex-boyfriend 
   Lance (David Austin), who threatens Jonathan's well-being if he dates 
   Tammy. Also plaguing Jonathan are visions of the pumpkin-masked 
   killer from a year earlier, but we soon learn that they may not be 
   visions at all. At Carver's big Halloween party that night, someone 
   begins slicing up the cast's faces like pumpkins <A HREF="pumpkin_karver_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/pumpkin karver dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="171" HEIGHT="250" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(among
    other carnage) and since Jonathan is new to town (and an expert 
   pumpkin carver), the suspicion falls on him. Old-timer Ben Wickets 
   (Terrence Evans, the legless Monty in <B><A HREF="texas_chainsaw_massacre_2003.htm">THE
    TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE</A></B> remake [2003] and it's prequel <B><A HREF="texas_chainsaw_massacre_the_beginning_2006.htm">THE
    TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE BEGINNING</A></B> [2006]), who is also 
   an expert pumpkin carver, pulls Jonathan aside to show him his 
   personal carving collection and sharp tools of the trade, relates to 
   Jonathan the bloody history of the town and tells him that a 
   mysterious carver appears every Halloween. As the party goes late 
   into the night and more people disappear, the killer (who likes to 
   skin his victims, leaving their teeth and jaw bones exposed on their 
   faces) begins appearing more and more to Jonathan. Is Jonathan 
   imagining all this or is it really happening? The maddening final 
   scene will make you want to kick in your TV screen, as it throws the 
   preceeding 83 minutes out the window and cheats the viewer out of a 
   satisfying (or much of any) conclusion. It instead goes for a cheap 
   shock and sets up the inevitable sequel.&nbsp; This by-the-numbers 
   horror flick, directed by Robert Mann (<B><A HREF="trapped_1999.htm">TRAPPED</A></B> 
   - 1999), is professionally made and acted, but the screenplay (by 
   Mann and Producer Sheldon Silverstein) offers nothing new to the 
   genre. There are some graphic murders, including a gory giant drill-through-the-stomach
    scene, and good use of Dolby Digital 5.1 sound throughout the film, 
   but the revelation by Jonathan of his father's sudden disappearance 
   when he was a kid and some logic-defying scenes late in the film 
   reeks of desperation. Instead of being a killer-on-the-loose film, 
   the script tries tossing some supernatural mumbo-jumbo into the mix, 
   including a scene of the pumpkin-masked killer popping-up suddenly 
   out of the solid ground and Jonathan levitating from a prone to 
   upright position (thanks to running the footage in reverse). The film 
   also contains standard teen cliches, including angry ex-boyfriends 
   made to look like the killer (too easy to be true), drunk teens doing 
   stupid things (including eating live grasshoppers) and sex before 
   death. I will give props to one funny death scene, though. It's when 
   drunk party organizer Bonedaddy (David Phillips) is taking a piss in 
   a pumpkin patch and the killer comes up behind him and cuts his head 
   off with a sickle. The next shot shows Bonedaddy's headless body 
   pissing into the open mouth of his decapitated head! <B>T</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">HE
