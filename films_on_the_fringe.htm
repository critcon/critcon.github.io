   Cinema Image Productions brings us a double feature of two fun low 
   budgeters featuring murder, mayhem, madness, blood, sex, and more. <B><A HREF="and _then_the_were_dead_2004.htm">AND
    THEN THEY WERE DEAD</A></B> is the story of seven strangers who get 
   invited to a dinner party. The characters are your traditional 
   &quot;Clue&quot; types (businessman, butler, maid, horny guy, bitchy 
   wife). An unseen assailant begins picking off the sleazy characters 
   one by one quickly turning this into a slasher/who<A HREF="and_then_they_were_dead_guilty_pleasures_1997.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/and then they were dead-guilty pleasures dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="139" HEIGHT="195" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>dunit/mystery.
    Ray Schwetz directs and Joe Zaso, Tina Krause, Darian Caine (who 
   gets murdered while naked in the shower), and Schwetz himself all 
   star. Marcus Koch handled the make-up effects. <B><A HREF="guilty_pleasures_1997.htm">GUILTY
    PLEASURES</A></B> brings us a macabre pair of stories, one directed 
   by Joseph F. Parda and the other directed by Joe Zaso. Two women 
   living in an apartment building are both facing dilemmas that lead to 
   unspeakable horrors. In &quot;Nocturnal Emissions,&quot; Silvia 
   Resino (Alexandra Paulhiac) breaks up with her boyfriend. Around the 
   same time, a psycho targeting nude models kills one of her friends. 
   She then begins to receive threatening phone calls, her ex-boyfriend 
   immediately becomes a suspect and a detective (played by Zaso) tries 
   to get her to help him out. Naively thinking the detective is 
   somebody she can trust and will do what's best for her, it leads to a 
   conclusion that makes her sorry she ever got involved with him. 
   &quot;Method to the Madness&quot; tells the story of Rosemarie Curtis 
   (Sasha Graham), a pretty young actress in New York City trying to get 
   work. Looking for help with &quot;method acting,&quot; she finds an 
   acting coach who she believes will be helpful. Problem is, her friend 
   Monica fears a horrible secret from the past that Rosemarie can't 
   seem to suppress any longer will reveal itself. This makes for a 
   horrifying ordeal involving death and more as it eventually causes 
   Rosemarie's downfall. <B>AND THEN THEY WERE DEAD</B> and <B>GUILTY PLEASURES</B> 
   are both enjoyable B-movie horrors that deliver in gore and nudity 
   and are entertaining in cheesy kind of way. <B>AND THEN</B>, in my 
   opinion, is the better movie of the two, obviously since it was made 
   much later than <B>PLEASURES</B> and it has the better quality and 
   effects. Fans of Joe Zaso, Tina Krause, Darian Caine, and Sasha 
   Graham should definitely add this DVD to their collection. The 
   special features on the <B>AND THEN</B> side of the disc include a 
   commentary with Ray Schwetz and Joe Zaso, a behind-the-scenes 
   documentary, photo gallery, and trailer and the <B>PLEASURES</B> side

   the middle of an all-out gang war involving drugs, guns and violence. 
   The two go out looking for adventure one night and bring home a 
   couple of girls who seem normal at first. After sleeping with them, 
   the two wake up in the morning to find the girls gone and they both 
   feel nauseated and can't figure out what happened to them. It so 
   turns out that the girls were angels from the other side and they 
   infected them with a virus that turns them into vampires with a 
   thirst for blood by biting them on the neck. Stephen and Ian both 
   become immortal, join a gang of vampires and are directed to kill and 
   drink the blood of the living so the angels can reclaim the world 
   that they believe belonged to them. Eventually a demon from hell 
   intervenes to stop the angels from having everything all to 
   themselves which results in an action-packed showdown with a 
   supernatural battle between good and evil. <B><A HREF="at_dawn_they_sleep_2000b.htm">AT
    DAWN THEY SLEEP</A></B> is a very enjoyable video gore effort. Brian 
   Paulin directed, wrote, stars, co-produced, composed, photographed, 
   edited, did makeup effects and basically handled the whole project 
   single-handedly. The film is loaded with everything you could ask 
   for: gun battles, car crashing, violence, naked females, profanity, 
   cheesy monster outfits and devil makeup, and outrageous and 
   over-the-top gore scenes including beheadings, disembowelments, 
   dismemberments, throats ripped out, brains blown out with guns, heads 
   split with axes, flesh ripping, melting bodies and knives through 
   skulls. In other words, perfect for a Friday night when you have a 
   six pack and get together with your buddies. The Video Outlaw DVD 
   contains many extras such as director's commentary, behind-the-scenes

    old high school friends raping a young girl who he had a crush on in 
   a basement while they were getting drunk and playing drinking games. 
   Now married and studying to become a doctor, Brandon does his best to 
   let go of the horrible memories, but they keep getting worse and 
   worse. Eventually Brandon takes it upon himself to track down the now 
   grown-up high school kids who had raped the girl near and dear to him 
   and drove her to suicide and proceeds to bump them off in a variety 
   of extremely brutal and gory ways. Andrew Copp has done a splendid 
   job creating a disturbing and nihilistic film with <B>THE ATROCITY CIRCLE</B>.
    The acting (especially from Workman) is very good for the most part, 
   the guys playing the rapists do a fine job making the characters come 
   as the sleaziest scum on the planet, and the film doesn't shy away 
   from the red stuff at all as people are tortured, slashed, stabbed in 
   the head, castrated, dismembered, gutted, have their rectums carved 
   out, etc. If you enjoyed <B><A HREF="#A Underground">AUGUST UNDERGROUND</A></B>

   of college kids who get drunk at a party and decide to defrost a 
   refrigerator. The fridge doesn't take too kindly to this and it comes 
   to life and starts killing and eating the kids. One character loses 
   their arm in the door and another is impaled on the handle. The only

   it on his stump and goes on a gory rampage. Finally, we have a

    HEIGHTS</B>. It also has interviews with the cast and crew, 
   promotional footage, and footage from the movie's screening at a

   Looking for something different in the world of low budget

   Fred Vogel and Toe Tag Pictures. This home video classic follows two 
   sick and deranged psychopaths and<A HREF="august_underground_trilogy.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/august underground dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="159" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   their adventures torturing and killing people in Southwestern 
   Pennsylvania while one of them films it all with a camcorder. The 
   movie was shot to look like a home movie intentionally. Vogel wanted 
   to portray the world what the world looks like through the eyes of a 
   serial killer. He wanted to give it the look of a snuff film. The 
   film is definitely not for all tastes. It&#146;s loaded with 
   extremely graphic sex, rape, torture, gore and full frontally nude 
   women strapped to chairs covered in blood with contusions on their 
   faces and sitting in a pile of their own feces. We are treated to a 
   scene where the killers go into a convenient store, stab the clerk 
   and force a couple of customers to sniff each other&#146;s assholes. 
   People have their heads hammered in with waffle-nosed claw hammers 
   and we get plenty of graphic scenes with every bodily fluid 
   imaginable. If you want blood, shit, piss, vomit and cum, this 
   certainly delivers it all. It&#146;s an incredibly disturbing and 
   offensive movie that I found myself enjoying. <B><A HREF="august_underground_2001b.htm">AUGUST

   psychopath and a sicko girl who likes to have sex with her brother. 
   Her brother acting as their cameraman follows them on their murder, 
   rape and torture rampage across Pittsburgh. People have their heads 
   bashed in with hammers, throats are slit, our main psycho killers 
   scream and swear at each other a lot throughout most of the film, and 
   in one scene they torture a couple of girls by sticking their fingers 
   down their throats and vomiting on them. This sequel has a little bit 
   more gore than the first one and has the same sickening rape and 
   torture scenes with graphic shots of every bodily fluid imaginable.

   psychopathic couple from the last film and their adventures with a 
   camcorder as they murder and torture people in Pittsburgh. This is 
   probably the sickest of the series. We get the usual graphic rape, 
   skulls hammered in, slit throats, some disembowelments and 
   dismemberments, masturbation scenes, vomit, girls strapped naked to 
   chairs and having semen smeared on their breasts, our two psychos 
   screaming and swearing at each other, and a family murdered on 
   Christmas. You got to give to Fred Vogel and Toe Tag for making the 
   most outrageous, vile and offensive movies to come out of Pittsburgh.

   budget 16mm effort from director Matt Jaissle is actually better than

   is never boring. There are some very funny parts (like when a hand

   extreme gore too. We get an arm stabbed with forks, limbs hacked off,

    QUEEN BUTCHER</A><A NAME="BeautyQueenButcher"></A> (1991) -</B> Deep 
   from the bowels of early '90s shot-on-video mayhem and from the vault 
   of Camp Motion Pictures comes this 
   never-before-released-in-any-format-until-now SOV cheese fest that 
   makes one wonder why a company like <A HREF="beauty_queen_butcher_1991.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/beauty queen butcher dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="157" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Cinema
    Home Video never picked it up for release back in the day. Phyllis 
   Loden is an overweight, unattractive nerdy high school girl looking 
   to become beautiful like the other girls and win a beauty pageant. 
   Constantly picked on, ridiculed, and teased by a group of snobbish 
   beauty pageant queens, Phyllis desperately looks for a way to change 
   her looks, enter the contest and become the next beauty queen 
   extraordinaire. When one of the nasty beauty pageant bitches decides 
   to get even with Phyllis by doing away with her cat after it caused 
   her to have an allergic reaction, Phyllis decides enough is enough 
   and proceeds to slaughter her pageant tormentors one by one. While <B>BEAUTY
    QUEEN BUTCHER</B> is a welcome release from Camp and it's nice they 
   came across a lost SOV slasher from 1991, by no means is it a good 
   movie by any stretch of the imagination. One of its biggest problems 
   is that it's too long and could've used better editing. They're 
   really isn't a whole lot of gore on hand either, but one of the few 
   bloody deaths where a girl is stabbed with her beauty pageant crown 
   is kind of amusing. If you're a really big SOV/backyard horror 
   enthusiast, this may be of some interest to you. Just don't expect 
   anything truly memorable or a gorefest that's worth getting up in 
   arms about. This appears to be the only movie director Jill Zurborg 
   ever made. The Camp DVD contains a behind-the-scenes documentary and 
   trailers for other Camp releases. A <A HREF="http://www.CampMotionPictures.com">Camp

   Herman and Falcon Video comes the perfect companion piece to <B><A HREF="#Horrortales666">HORRORTALES.666</A></B> 
   (2003). This time we are presented with three short stories from Joel 
   D. Wynkoop, Sharkey Video and Falcon. The wraparound segment stars 
   Herman as a writer who&#146;s suffering from writer&#146;s block and 
   is basically beating his head against the wall to come up with some 
   new ideas. He comes up with <A HREF="before_i_die_2003.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/before i die vhs front.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="232" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>the
    following three stories. &#147;Time for Dessert&#148; from Wynkoop 
   Productions stars M. Catherine Holseybrook as a lady with an appetite 
   for men. It so appears that something very sinister lies behind her 
   seductive ways. The men she seduces and takes to a hotel all end up 
   disappearing. An average, bored and horny bachelor looking for 
   adventure hopes he can get lucky and get into bed with Ms. 
   Holseybrook. Unfortunately for him, her dark secret shows itself and 
   he finds himself wishing he would have took his business elsewhere. 
   &#147;Last Resort&#148; from Sharkey Video stars Dawn Murphy and 
   David Lee as a couple who go to an old resort in the middle of 
   nowhere for a honeymoon. It appears they haven&#146;t seen <B><A HREF="shining_1980.htm">THE
    SHINING</A></B> (1980) enough to know to stay away from resorts that 
   have a bad history and have been abandoned for good reason. The 
   spirits or whatever it is that inhabit the place send them messages 
   that they want them out. After getting out of there, Lee learns 
   something about the resort&#146;s past that may change his life 
   forever. &#147;Someone Is Sleeping In My Bed&#148; from Herman and 
   Falcon starts off with a couple mischievous trick-or-treaters being 
   bumped off by a masked psychopath. We are then introduced to a woman 
   played by the lovely Nancy Feliciano who is stalked by the psycho in 
   her home. The ending to this story (which I won&#146;t give away) 
   comes as a surprise that somehow ties it to the wraparound and kind 
   of reprises the first segment of <B>HORRORTALES.666</B>. You&#146;ll 
   have to see it for yourself. <B>BEFORE I DIE</B> is another nice 
   collection of short films from three of the hottest independent 
   producers on the underground scene. While it doesn&#146;t seem to 
   rely as much on the T&amp;A as others of its ilk, it does have enough 
   steamy moments to keep the perverts entertained. As for graphic 
   violence and bloodletting, gorehounds may find it kind of dry. But 
   it&#146;s still something bad movie fans and connoisseurs of zero 
   budget horror should eat up nonetheless. For fans of Nancy Feliciano 
   and Dawn Murphy, this is definitely the perfect treat for you. 
   Written and directed by Dave Castiglione, Dawn Murphy, Phil Herman 
   and Joel D. Wynkoop. Wynkoop has a part as one of Holseybrook&#146;s 
   victims in the first segment. With Gusto Perez, Kevin Bangos, Chris

   into a magic shop and buys a strange black voodoo doll puppet. It 
   seems that the doll somehow always finds its way back to store the 
   day after somebody buys it. She starts hallucinating about the doll 
   having sexual encounters with her. Eventually the doll comes to life, 
   knocks her unconscious, ties her to a bed, and begins to sexually 
   molest her. She then begins to enjoy it and the doll says things like 
   &quot;I'm going to pop your cherry bitch!&quot; and &quot;Beg for it 
   bitch!&quot; The next day the doll mysteriously disappears. Jones 
   then tries relationships with other men, but they can't seem to 
   fulfill her desires like the doll did. She then goes back to the 
   store to buy it again but soon finds out the doll has something evil 
   in mind. Mere words cannot describe this movie. I'd say it's in a 
   class of its own. There's lots of nudity and obscene language and the 
   movie is guaranteed to offend. The acting is pretty bad and the 
   photography is washed out and has the look of a poorly shot porn 
   movie. The Casio keyboard music score, however, is very good. I 
   really liked the rock song that plays over the opening and end 
   credits. I'd have a hard time recommending this to anybody who 
   doesn't watch anything beyond the mainstream movies, but if you're 
   adventurous, a bad movie fan and a shot on video enthusiast, this 
   should be right up your alley. Mr. Turner also wrote and produced. He

   Stanski, Nancy Feliciano, and Debbie D (who goes topless in a few 
   scenes). Frank the Tank rips a guy&#146;s throat out with his bare 
   hands in the beginning before he becomes a zombie. A guy has his arm 
   ripped off and is beaten to death with it. One guy has his head 
   punched clean off. Before doing away with Debbie D, Frank&#146;s 
   penis rots off and he says, &#147;Oh, my peepee! Guess I don&#146;t 
   have any use for you anymore.&#148; The sickest scene in the movie is 
   a part where a guy is on the toilet with diarrhea and Frank comes in 
   with a shovel, sticks it in the guy&#146;s stomach and cuts his 
   bowels open and drains and eats the digested food out of him while 
   it&#146;s going through his system as he takes a shit. I got a really 
   putrid acid vomit taste in my mouth during this part. Another sick 
   part is when a guy gets boiled alive by scalding hot water in shower

   Camp Blackwoods. They run into a tough-talking woman named Harris who 
   turns out to be their guide. After getting their campsite set up in 
   the woods, Harris tells them a story around the campfire about a guy 
   who killed his wife and her lover after finding them in bed together. 
   A legend that the clown mask-wearing killer still roams the woods 
   won't seem to go away. Soon enough, they wake up the next morning to 
   find the body of what appears to be Harris burnt to a crisp on the 
   campfire wood. One of them suspects that it's the clown killer so 
   they decide to get their asses out of the woods. Soon they have a 
   run-in with the clown boy with a machete. One girl sprains her ankle 
   trying to get away. One guy tries to be a hero and take on the killer 
   himself. And one guy accidentally kills his wounded girlfriend 
   thinking she's the killer. After they've all been bumped off, it's 
   down to the heroine to have the final showdown with clown boy. While 
   it's certainly nothing new (and the killer's identity becomes very 
   obvious almost less than halfway through), the film does have its

   one. As far as low budget slasher comedies go, this one isn't too 
   bad. While there isn't any nudity and not a whole lot of gore, the 
   film is still pretty entertaining for what it is. There's a funny 
   death by celery scene and a scene where a girl is drowned in a toilet 
   and her corpse is later seen with feces smeared on the face. There 
   are some pretty good bands on the soundtrack and the VHS contains a 
   music video after the movie. Director Tommy Faircloth made <B><A HREF="generation_ax_1998.htm">GENERATION

   (2003). Here we will take a look at what I feel is the best of the <B>FAMILY
    PORTRAITS</B> trilogy. <B>CUTTING MOMENTS</B> starts off with a 
   young boy playing with Power Rangers dolls in his front yard while 
   his father is<A HREF="cutting_moments_1997.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/cutting moments vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="194" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   focused on trimming the bushes with hedge clippers. Both very quiet 
   characters, the father comes up to the boy and is immediately 
   disturbed by the position in which he sees the toys laying on the 
   ground and proceeds to pick them up. Later on, the boy, father and 
   mother are all shown eating dinner. The mother asks the boy how 
   school was. The kid doesn't seem interested in talking at all and is 
   anxious to leave the table. Something appears to be very wrong with 
   this seemingly normal family. The mother is having the worst possible 
   suspicions about the father and son's relationship. She seems to want 
   her husband to notice her more. One day, she dresses up in a pretty 
   red dress with lipstick and make-up to get him to take an interest in 
   her, but he continues to watch sports on TV. This seems to trigger a 
   psychotic episode in the mother as she goes into her bathroom and 
   wipes off her lipstick. What then proceeds is one of the most graphic 
   scenes of self-mutilation ever committed to celluloid. She mutilates 
   her lips with a wiry bathroom brush and slices off what's left of her 
   lips with a pair of scissors. After this horrific act of 
   self-inflicted torture, she then finally gets the attention of her 
   husband, leading to a gory murder-suicide during sex between the 
   couple as the husband does away with what's left of their sexual 
   organs with the help of his own hedge clippers. The son is thus left 
   an orphan in the end. <B><A HREF="cutting_moments_1997b.htm">CUTTING MOMENTS</A></B> 
   has been called one of the most disturbing movies ever and it's one 
   that certainly lives up to its hype. Shot on 16mm by Douglas Buck, 
   the film quickly became a favorite of many film festivals and Buck as 
   a director has received praise from many of extreme cinema's most 
   prominent figures such as Abel Ferrara (<B><A HREF="driller_killer_1979.htm">THE

   disturbing horror shorts like Nacho Cerda's <B><A HREF="aftermath_1994.htm">AFTERMATH</A></B>

   compilation (also called <B>CUTTING MOMENTS</B>), the film then got 
   its best treatment when released on DVD by Home Vision Entertainment 
   as part of the <B>FAMILY PORTRAITS</B> anthology. When you watch the 
   shorts on the DVD in the order in which Buck filmed them, each short 
   actually gets progressively less horrific with <B>HOME</B> being a 
   similar disturbing drama, but not being anywhere near as graphic and 
   when you finally get to <B>PROLOGUE</B> it's mostly a straight-up 
   drama and not horror at all. Whichever you like best, you can 
   definitely agree Buck is an underrated director and talent to be 
   reckoned with. Tom Savini consulted on some of the effects on <B>CUTTING
    MOMENTS</B>. The Image/Home Vision 2-disc DVD of <B>FAMILY PORTRAITS</B> 
   contains the three separate shorts with director's commentary on the

   way into society, he meets up with a priest and confesses that he was 
   hanged as a vampire back in 1776 but in order for him to stay alive 
   in the present time, he must kill and drink blood. A rash of killings 
   ensue all over town in which victims are found with poisonous saliva 
   in their bloodstreams. Lt. Vargo (Tom Savini), whose daughter was 
   murdered years before, is trying to solve the murders. Latham meets 
   up with a female zoo curator (played by Moon Unit Zappa) and falls in 
   love with her. Meanwhile, a series of copycat killings occur where 
   victims have their blood drained from their bodies. It appears the 
   culprit behind these murders is somebody who wants to be immortal 
   like Benjamin. This leads to a climactic battle between vampire and 
   human monster. <B>DARK CRAVING</B> (originally released on VHS by <A HREF="http://www.tempevideo.com">Tempe

    is, for the most part, a half-decent film. Tom Savini gives a fine 
   performance as the police lieutenant. The film, however, has a 
   tendency to drag in some places. In fact there were moments when I 
   felt like I was drifting off to sleep. On the other hand, there are 
   some decent make-ups and blood effects by Savini, Jerry Gergely and 
   Greg Funk, and the locations in Pittsburgh that were used seem to 
   work very well. I haven't read Russo's original novel that this is 
   based on, so I really couldn't do a comparison, but overall the film 
   is a fairly enjoyable low budgeter. Michael J. Pollard is featured in 
   a cameo as &quot;Dr. Lubbock.&quot; The original Tempe VHS under the

   father and goes to bars and gets drunk. At one point Goose 
   contemplates suicide, only to be found and picked up by one of his 
   fellow gang members who were a little peeved at him for leaving the

   they try to use Goose to help them with an armored car robbery. After 
   agreeing to go along with this, Goose still hasn't forgotten about 
   what they did to his girl and plots his brutal revenge against them. 
   What follows is one of the bloodiest gang wars ever committed to 
   celluloid filled with shoot-outs, people run over with cars, broken

   these hidden gems from this era is a Super 8 gorefest by Tom Vollmann 
   called <B>DEAD MEAT. <A HREF="dead_meat_1993b.htm">DEAD MEAT</A></B> 
   is a twisted little flick about a serial killer known as the 
   &quot;Senses Taker&quot; who has been gruesomely removing the senses 
   from his victims. Fingers, feet and noses are just a few of the body 
   parts he collects.&nbsp; A couple detectives try to track the maniac 
   down. The psycho appears to be a church gardener with a perverse 
   agenda. He stores his victim's body parts in a freezer and keeps the 
   appetite of his hungry piranhas in a tank satisfied with their 
   remains. <B>DEAD MEAT</B> is cheesy and laughable at times, but it 
   has a very gritty look and a sort of grindhouse feel thanks to its 
   old school Super 8 cinematography. The acting isn't the greatest but 
   the overall enthusiasm and inspiration of the filmmakers helps and 
   the extremely perverse characteristics of the killer give the film a 
   twistedly disturbing and depraved streak which helps carry it through 
   making it a corny but unsettling experience. <B>DEAD MEAT</B> has had 
   at least three different releases on VHS. Originally self-distributed 
   by the filmmakers through their production company Cool Movies, it 
   was then distributed through Todd Cook's Cemetery Cinema and then 
   again through Kevin Lindenmuth's Brimstone Productions in the late 
   '90s. This review is based on the Cemetery Cinema release. The cast 
   includes Nick Kostopoulos, Jim Darley, Reid Ostrowski, John Klein,

   tells the story of the town of Eidolon Crossing, a town that was once 
   prosperous and the home to Dogwood Park, a successful amusement park 
   that children would go to all the time. But all this changed once 
   kids started disappearing and turning up brutally murdered. Bo<A HREF="deadwood_park_2007.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/deadwood park dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="121" HEIGHT="175" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>dies
    were found in an old mine shaft. This led to the park's closure and 
   the eventual collapse of Eidolon Crossing's economy and it's 
   reputation as a peaceful place. Jake Richardson's (William Clifton) 
   brother disappeared in the town back in 1979. Being obsessed with 
   finding out who was behind his brother's disappearance and finally 
   getting to the bottom of whoever or whatever was responsible for all 
   the other bizarre occurrences and deaths from over the years, Jake 
   goes back to the town to investigate in hopes of getting the truth 
   once and for all. But getting the truth turns out to be an uphill 
   battle and a nightmare as well. Jake is haunted by the spirits of the 
   dead children and hears voices and sees other apparitions. Jake is 
   driven to desperation to find out what it all means and what he finds 
   in the end turns out to be something much bigger than he bargained 
   for. <B>DEADWOOD PARK</B> is a beautiful, eerie, suspenseful, and 
   atmospheric film. It is without a doubt Wicked Pixel's greatest 
   accomplishment thus far. The movie doesn't rely on blood and guts to 
   be scary (although it does get kind of gory near the end), the choice 
   of location and scenery is excellent, and William Clifton gives a 
   fine performance in the lead role. It goes to show how far Eric 
   Stanze and Wicked Pixel have come over the years. This is absolutely 
   their most professional-looking film to date. The Cinema Epoch DVD of <B>DEADWOOD</B> 
   contains an audio commentary with Stanze, outtakes, and a music video 
   of &quot;Zombie '79&quot; by Crypt 33. With Lindsey Luscri, Bryan

   of them in jail at the time. Let free once it was determined no crime 
   was committed, their movie has gained a cult following as a feature 
   with a political message about how the media has a tendency to 
   exploit violence and death in today's society rather than the movie 
   just being an exploitation of the Columbine tragedy itself which some 
   had accused it of being. Hellfire and Smack both star in the roles of 
   two outcast high school kids whose characters are based on Columbine 
   killers Eric Harris and Dylan Kleibold. The characters put up with 
   teasing and bullying at school and one day decide they have no faith 
   that anyone can help them with their problems and the two go on a 
   shooting rampage at their high school before taking their own lives. 
   The story is actually not too farfetched in describing the kind of 
   atmosphere the Columbine kids were most likely exposed to. The 
   environment the kids are in is filled with sex, drugs, rock music, 
   religious fanatics, jocks, and peer pressure. Hellfire and Smack did 
   a fine job of portraying the reality of these situations that occur 
   everyday in schools across the country. While the movie has a 
   tendency to be a little over-the-top at times, for the most part the 
   social commentary on how people are so quick to judge something as 
   being exploitive while at the same time exploiting awful events 
   themselves on an almost daily basis is very evident throughout and 
   the overall message is very effective. Hellfire and Smack co-directed

   Monster&quot; (pronounced cock woods). Legend has it that people who 
   masturbate in the Cochwoods forest threaten to conjure up the monster 
   who will go on a crazed killing spree. We <A HREF="evil_awakening_2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/evil awakening dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="97" HEIGHT="141" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>start
    the story out with Geno and his low life, foul-mouthed fat slob 
   friend named Sam who lives with his father. Sam drives around cursing 
   and spewing all sorts of obscenities like there's no tomorrow 
   (&quot;Ah, you cocksucker! You motherfucker!&quot;, &quot;You stupid, 
   motherfucking, cunt sucking faggot!&quot;, and &quot;You monkey tit! 
   Monkey tit! Monkey tit!&quot;), runs over an old man standing in the 
   middle of the road and pees on him. It so turns out that somebody 
   went and cranked one off out in Cochwoods and the evil Cochwoods 
   Monster (basically a man in standard black slasher clothing with a 
   monster mask) springs up and goes on gory rampage turning the 
   countryside upside down. It's up to Geno and the local cops to find a 
   way to trap the monster and kill it. Despite being zero budget and 
   shot with a camcorder with incredibly cheesy acting, stunts and 
   effects, <B>EVIL AWAKENING</B> manages to be a very fun time with 
   lots of humor. Director Geno McGahee definitely has his heart in the 
   right place as the campy feeling the movie starts off with keeps up 
   for the duration and there's plenty of gore and funny one-liners to 
   keep you entertained. This alone makes it easy to forgive some of the 
   shortcomings with the technical factors. It will be interesting to 
   see what Geno and X Posse can do when they have more money. The DVD 
   contains a commentary with the crew, the original 1996 <B>EVIL AWAKENING</B> 
   short film, a music video, trailer, and a promo teaser for Geno and X 
   Posse's new movie <B><A HREF="rise_of_the_scarecrows_2009.htm">RISE

   small boobs and wants giant knockers so the guys will like her. Phil 
   the Demon is back to grant her this wish. But as always, you have to 
   be careful what you wish for. We are introduced to a vampire by the 
   name of Razor McBleed who&#146;s a Journey fan and things soon start 
   to go downhill. In <B>MCNASTIEST</B>, a young man is tired of his 
   small penis and wants a humongous shlong so he can declare himself a 
   real sex machine. His huge-breasted bitch girlfriend (played by adult 
   film star Cherry Brady) breaks up with him because of this. He 
   enlists the help of his witch friend so she can summon the Sex Demon 
   to give him what he wants. This fails at first and later the Sex 
   Demon appears (I believe it&#146;s the sister of Phil the Demon). The 
   female demon makes the witch girl magically grow a dick so they can 
   fuck. Then the demon magically grows a dick and kills the witch girl 
   by pulling her guts out through her asshole while she&#146;s screwing 
   her up the ass. Our lonely guy with the small dick wakes up to the 
   find that the demon has granted his wish and he has an enormous 
   4-foot shlong. But as expected, this miracle soon turns out to be a 
   curse. The parties in both movies end in gore-soaked bloodbaths with 
   vampires and zombies. The films are loaded with sick and offensive 
   material in the vein of Troma, naked girls, dicks getting chopped 
   off, dismemberment, toilet humor, and more outrageous stuff that I

   filmmaking psychotic kids concerns the story of a female professor 
   named Olivia Clark (Julie King) who&#146;s interested in researching 
   the story of the killings that rocked a small Wisconsin town four 
   years ago. She proceeds to interview several friends and family 
   members of all the victims and killers. But everybody who she 
   interviews soon turns up dead. It is learned that one of the maniacs 
   named Piper got away and another one named Nancy ended up in a mental 
   institution. Somebody who closely resembles Eddie, another one of the 
   psychos who got killed four years ago, is seen wandering around a 
   college campus. It&#146;s suspected that this person may be a twin 
   brother of Eddie. As the bodies pile up, Olivia begins to feel wave 
   of terror closing in on her. While this sequel is every bit as 
   interesting and enjoyable as the first film, it&#146;s main problem 
   is that it&#146;s way too long (two and a half hours). It seems like

   Filmmaker John R. Hand brings us this bizarre and intriguing take on 
   the Frankenstein story, shot on Super 8 and written, directed, 
   produced, edited by and starring Hand. Hand is Dr. Victor Karlstein 
   who runs a medical facility. After his girlfriend dies due to a 
   condition at the clinic, Karlstein manages to reanimate her, but she 
   needs the fresh body parts of women in order to survive. Acts of 
   murder and butchery ensue as Karlstein searches for body parts needed 
   to give the love of his life a new body. <B><A HREF="frankensteins_bloody_nightmare_2006b.htm">FRANKENSTEIN'S
    BLOODY NIGHTMARE</A></B> is a decent, ambitious effort with a very 
   artsy feel to it. While definitely not the best I've seen, there is 
   much worse. Some viewers may find it confusing and may need multiple 
   viewings to understand it better. Those with an open mind who are 
   able to follow it closely will be able to appreciate Hand's effort 
   and his handling of the picture on such a shoestring budget. That 
   along makes the DVD worth a purchase. You also have to love the name 
   of one of the characters, &quot;Andrew Milligan.&quot; Nice homage I 
   must add. The Unearthed Films DVD contains a director's commentary, a

   like Dracula and Frankenstein, uses props and sets that look like 
   they came from high school plays, and it delivers in cheesy gore, 
   sex, and offensive humor. Donna Death stars as the vampire 
   Scumbalina, Robert Andrews is Dr. Frankenberry, Brenda Bergman is 
   Buffy, Richard Hell from the punk band The Voidoids is the Rawhide 
   Kid, Bruno Zeus is the hunchback Geeko, Gumby Spangler is Flavian, 
   and Jim Giacama is Dean Quagmire. The Formaldehyde Man created by 
   Frankenberry is a two-headed monster that wreaks havoc near the end. 
   Some of the makeup and gore effects by Tyler Smith, Ed French and Tom 
   Lauten are half decent. Horror host John Zacherley does an 
   introduction to the movie and he tells us to strap Dixie cups to our 
   noses. Fangoria's Bob Martin has a cameo as &quot;Uncle Bob&quot; 
   himself trying to sell magazines to the Formaldehyde monster. He gets 
   his head ripped off and the head keeps talking. I thought that was

   kind of twist to the traditional serial killer story, Brian 
   Hirschbine and Abortion Bin Productions bring us the story of a 
   character known as &quot;The Man&quot; (played by Brandon Hursell). 
   The man has tried to find answers to life's <A HREF="god_memoirs_2007.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/god memoirs dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="195" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>many
    questions for years. Trying to understand God and why some things in 
   the world occur the way they do, he does monologues where he talks 
   about God and people's beliefs. In a flashback, where are shown the 
   man as a child and how he was stabbed, almost to death, by his father 
   right after his father gorily beat his mother to death with a frying 
   pan. His father then blew his brains out. In order to find these 
   answers to life's many questions, he resorts to killing as a way to 
   find the human condition. He uses dismembered body parts, organs, and 
   flesh from his victims to put together what he believes is God's 
   creature. <B>THE GOD MEMOIRS</B> is one of the most unusual films 
   I've ever seen to say the least. It has some beautiful imagery and it 
   makes you become sympathetic towards the killer in a way most movies 
   never do. The scenes of him talking grab your attention and hold you 
   throughout. While it's not an all-out gorefest, there is some gore 
   and torture to be found, and some very disturbing scenes as well. 
   It's a film that's very hard to describe. Just the fact that it's 
   hard to describe is what makes it so unique. It's clearly a thinking 
   man's serial killer film that makes you see how the killer views the 
   world and how he's clearly thought of himself as a failure all his 
   life. In some ways, it can show how cruel the world itself can be 
   too. Once again, it's very unusual to find a gore film that does what 
   this one does. For all these factors, Brian Hirschbine must be 
   commended for making the film such an intriguing experience.

   (2003) come to mind. Lucas Corcoran stars as Kelly Brady, a juvenile 
   delinquent who, in his opening narration, says, &quot;Fuck life.&quot;
    Kelly's sister was raped and murdered a year before. He goes around 
   on his bike selling drugs to various undesirables in his neighborhood 
   and causing all kinds of mischief. Meanwhile, two documentary 
   filmmakers who go by the names &quot;Chuck Norris&quot; and 
   &quot;Ollie North&quot; (played by Les Norris and Oliver Assiran 
   themselves) are making their rounds in town interviewing people about 
   the Brady murder. A Satanist is among the people they interview. The 
   film is filled with many bizarre subplots and situations involving 
   weird and seemingly unsympathetic characters that come into play. We 
   get a butcher that accidentally cuts off his fingers, a serial killer 
   being hunted by a couple detectives, a crazy kid who drinks blood 
   because he believes he's actually a vampire, etc. <B>GORNO</B> is 
   quite a mixed bag of a do-it-yourself art house effort.&nbsp; Does it 
   work as a movie? To be honest, it kind of works in the same way that 
   John Waters' early films work: crazy, vile, and offbeat. It's a good 
   example of rough renegade filmmaking at its best with a 
   pseudo-documentary style that may appeal to some fans of things like 
   Giuseppe Andrews' dark comedies and certain films from the Cinema of 
   Transgression movement. It gives the same effect as watching any of 
   those. Therefore, it's not for everyone's tastes for sure and some 
   may find it offensive. Nevertheless, it's a shoestring budget effort 
   from a couple ambitious filmmakers who set out to achieve what looks 
   like a genuine piece of social commentary. Whether or not it succeeds 
   in the message trying to be conveyed is debatable, but in the end, 
   it's definitely a piece of art filmmaking that fans of the 
   avant-garde should view at least once. <B>GORNO</B> is available on

   recent years. A group of friends gather together. One of them scares 
   the others with horror stories. Soon a killer in an old hag mask

   average slasher fare, the film is actually suspenseful in some parts

   (2003) &#150;</B> This shot-on-video horror anthology is a B-movie 
   follower&#146;s wet dream. We are presented with five stories and a 
   wraparound segment. The wraparound segment stars Joel D. Wynkoop as a 
   burglar who breaks into a writer&#146;s home. He comes across a 
   computer with a set of short stories called 
   &#147;HorrorTales.666.&#148; He starts reading the stories and 
   can&#146;t stop. The first story &#147;Woman in Shadows&#148; comes 
   from Phil Herman and Falcon Video and stars Herman as a man going 
   through a dilemma with his girlfriend (Kimberly Lynn Cole). He keeps 
   seeing images of a woman in his apartment. She keeps appearing and 
   disappearing. He&#146;s apparently suffering from blackouts and <A HREF="horrortales666_2003.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/horrortales666 vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="175" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>believes
    this woman he&#146;s seeing may be somebody who knew and can&#146;t 
   remember who she is. The second story &#147;Luck of the Irish&#148; 
   comes from Dusty Fleischman and Morbid Productions and is about a 
   reporter on the trail of serial killer. For some reason he has very 
   accurate hunches as to where the killer is going to strike next. The 
   third story &#147;The Dead Forest&#148; comes from Ryan Cavalline and 
   4th Floor Pictures and is about a guy (Adam Berasi) who kills his 
   baby because it wouldn&#146;t stop crying. He puts the baby in a 
   trash bag and buries it in the woods. The guy is stricken with guilt 
   and becomes suicidal. He starts hearing voices in his head. Ghosts or 
   spirits of some kind in the woods start playing tricks on him and 
   slowly drive him to insanity. The fourth story &#147;Payback is 
   Hell&#148; comes from Gary Whitson and <A HREF="http://www.wavemovies.com">W.A.V.E.
    Productions</A> and basically doesn&#146;t have any real story at 
   all. It starts out with Pamela Sutch taking a shower and then 
   changing into a tight nurse&#146;s outfit and high heels and goes to 
   put on a show for a photographer. The photographer strangles her to 
   death, end of story. The fifth story &#147;Stop It, You&#146;re 
   Killing Me&#148; comes from Michael Hoffman Jr. and Wet Floor 
   Productions and stars Bill Cassinelli as an easygoing man named Jerry 
   with a friend named Brad who&#146;s kind of a thorn in his side. 
   Jerry meets a woman at a bar and the two of them hit it off from 
   there. What seems to be going perfectly is soon derailed as Jerry 
   finds that Brad betrayed him by taking his girl and it pushes him 
   over the edge. Overall, <B>HORRORTALES.666</B> is a nice collection 
   of short films from some of the leading filmmakers on the indie 
   scene. The first segment holds your attention throughout. The second 
   segment is interesting enough even though it&#146;s something 
   that&#146;s been done many times before. The third segment is done in 
   an eerie Edgar Allen Poe-type style. The fourth one there was really 
   no need for at all, but just to see Pamela Sutch naked and getting 
   killed. The fifth one is easily the most accomplished story and has a 
   twist in the end that makes you go &#147;Ha! Ha!&#148; like Nelson on <B><A HREF="simpsons_tv_series_&amp;_movie.htm">THE
    SIMPSONS</A></B>. The movie is only 60 minutes long, so if you have

   Falcon, Morbid, 4th Floor, W.A.V.E., and Wet Floor, this is the way 
   to go. With Nancy Feliciano, Julie Strain (as a publisher in the 
   wraparound), and Davie Keye. A Falcon Video Release. <B>Unrated</B> -MD</FONT></FONT></P>

   time to give us what is arguably their best film ever. The story 
   follows a horror novelist by the name of Marty Beck (Bob Dennis) who 
   rents a creepy old house in rural Pennsylvania so he can have a place 
   to <A HREF="house_that_screamed_2000.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/house that screamed vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="77" HEIGHT="139" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>stay

   moving into the house, Marty starts to experience some weird 
   disturbances and is plagued by nightmares and gruesome images in his 
   head. He soon learns that ghosts of people who lived at the house in 
   the past haunt the place. Soon the ghosts, apparitions, and 
   nightmarish images of ghastly slayings and mutilated bodies begin to 
   drive him to insanity. It becomes apparent that the ghosts will not 
   go away without a fight. Marty is eventually faced with a grim 
   decision that comes with him being forced to choose between his life 
   or facing continuous hell on earth. <B>THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED</B> is 
   without a doubt the Polonia Brothers&#146; most polished film to 
   date. While the film has enough skin and bloodshed to satisfy the 
   gore and sleaze fanatics, the story and characters are ultimately 
   what make the film work and hold your attention throughout. It shows 
   what the Polonia&#146;s are actually capable of. I know when most 
   people think of them and their movies, they immediately think of 
   words like cheap, cheesy, shot-on-video, etc. Not in this case. 
   It&#146;s nice to see what some people are capable when given the 
   opportunity. As they say, it&#146;s always good not to judge a book 
   by its cover. Tyler Smith (<B><A HREF="#Geek Maggot Bingo">GEEK

   causes difficulties for him with regards to his relationship with his

   is really not a bad picture. In my opinion, the film deserves some

   out to be a really good time. The movie opens with Dr. Moroflex 
   giving drinking game instructions for watching the movie. The rules 
   are #1: When Moroflex takes a sip you must take a drink from a 
   mutually agreed beverage. #2: Speed counts. The last player to take a

   (1993) &#150;</B> This shot-on-video slasher from Phil Herman&#146;s 
   Falcon Video stars Herman as Mike Rivers, a dude who loses his cool 
   and kills his girlfriend (Nancy Feliciano) and makes it look like 
   suicide. He then goes a rampage across the city carjacking various 
   motorists and killing them. A group of detectives try to track the 
   psycho down before more blood is shed. After the sister of Detective 
   Jackson (Patrice Jackson) is bumped off by the psychotic carjacker, 
   it pushes him over the edge and he decides to take matters into his 
   own hands and find the maniac himself. This leads to a brutal climax 
   involving a fight to the death between the detective and the psycho 
   jacker. If it sounds cheesy, you&#146;d be correct. It&#146;s amazing 
   how dumb the police in this one are as most of the evidence pointing 
   in the killer&#146;s direction is right in front of their faces and 
   they blow every opportunity they get. Herman and Jackson get into a 
   fistfight in a couple scenes where police are investigating the scene 
   of a crime and neither of them is brought up on assault charges. The 
   close up of a burning toy car in one scene where a car is supposed to 
   blow up is enough to have any average viewer rolling on the floor in 
   complete side-splitting laughter. That being said, it&#146;s movies 
   like these that in the end turn out enjoyable because of how corny 
   they are. Especially with one like this where it&#146;s clear the 
   filmmakers had hardly any money at all. Not everybody appreciates

    a trail of shot, stabbed, beaten and mauled bodies all over town. He 
   is especially hungry for revenge on the police force that almost had

   for the murders and this goes totally haywire and Jackson and another 
   cop end up shot dead by one of their fellow officers who now has the 
   blame placed on him. Jackson&#146;s friend James (Barry Gaines) who 
   was injured in a car explosion in the first movie gets out of the 
   hospital and tries to assist authorities in tracking down Rivers. For 
   a while it appears that Jackson is still alive as he calls James and 
   says he&#146;ll pick him up at the hospital. Only it turns out that 
   Rivers has taken Jackson&#146;s skin and dressed himself up in it and 
   James finds himself in for a nasty surprised when he&#146;s picked 
   up. James manages to get away and finds himself on the run. Things 
   take even more bizarre turns as James has nightmares in which 
   he&#146;s apparently in hell with Rivers. Rivers goes after more 
   innocent victims. It seems that he&#146;s a superhuman force that

    of a videotape that teaches him how to dress and act cool. He goes 
   out, gets a spiked haircut and goes to a nightclub. He picks up a 
   couple of girls who take him back to their hangout place where he 
   meets up with their two boyfriends who picked on him earlier. After 
   they beat him up, he decides he's had enough. He then proceeds to 
   bump off all his tormentors in extreme gore fashion. An office worker 
   who made fun of him is decapitated. A girl who he liked but didn't 
   take him seriously has her face melted off with acid. Kunkle punches 
   his mom in the face, straps her to a chair, dumps drain opener down 
   her throat and buries a meat cleaver in her head. One girl has her 
   belly slashed open with a knife. The two thugs who beat up Kunkle 
   find themselves tied to chairs with dynamite sticks strapped to their 
   heads. Kunkle sets off the fuses and their heads explode repainting 
   the room with blood and cranial innards (&quot;Blood red with brains!

   friends (Eric Spudic and Jason Contini) get together and reminisce 
   about their days in high school. One of them brings up the kids who 
   used to pick on them and give them a hard time. One gets the idea of 
   getting even with all their high school enemies by playing cruel

    when one of them accidentally shoots the kid in the neck with a 
   crossbow. Faced with a dead kid, they decide to get rid of the body 
   and hope nobody will ever find who did it. When one of their old 
   enemies comes across them while they&#146;re trying to hide the 
   corpse and throws eggs at them, they chase him down on his bike into 
   the woods and this bully meets a gruesome end. The two decide they 
   have a thirst for killing. This duo then proceeds to slaughter the 
   rest of their high school enemies in various gory ways. The bodies 
   pile up all over town and soon no one is safe. The directorial debut 
   of B-movie buff Eric Spudic isn&#146;t too bad. It got a few laughs 
   out of me in some parts. I think its main problem is that it&#146;s 
   kind of unrealistic in how the two friends are able to kill in 
   virtually broad daylight with nobody seeing them and be able to carry 
   out their killing spree for so long with nobody connecting any dots 
   or getting suspicious. Spudic writes, produces, directs and stars as 
   Jeffrey. Ron Bonk and Eric Stanze were the executive producers.

   Wrestling), holds them hostage and proceeds to slaughter them all one 
   at a time. This ultra low budget shot on video feature from Vegas is 
   definitely one of the most downright sadistic and repulsive movies 
   I've ever seen. Yet it's so damn amusing and over-the-top it's almost 
   comical giving it some sort of weird charm one can't put their finger 
   on. There's lots of incredibly gory and nasty killings in this one. 
   Levin ties a prostitute's leg up to his car, drive away, and rips her 
   leg off. He goes into a bar when nobody is around and pulls out his 
   wife's head and says to the bartender, &quot;Get me a beer! And get

   head flattened with a shovel. One girl is drilled to death and 
   another has a hammer claw stuck up underneath her rib cage. An arm is 
   pulled off. A Jehovah's Witness has his neck slammed in a door so 
   hard that it snaps his head off! A driver who gives Levin the middle 
   finger has his finger blown off with a gun and he says, &quot;Let's 
   see you pick your nose with that!&quot; And the most sickening scene 
   of all is when he cuts open a pregnant woman, rips out the baby and 
   splatters it against the wall. Directed by David Schwartz. David

    -</B> One of the absolute best 1980s shot-on-video efforts, this no 
   budget Australian wonder from Mark Savage is a nasty grindhouse-style 
   feature that sadly never saw release in the states until Subversive 
   Cinema picked it up and released it on DVD as part of a box set 
   called &quot;<A HREF="savage_sinema_from_down_under_2004.htm">Savage

    A BLOOD SYMPHONY</A></B> (2004). Already having been compared to 
   brutal and disturbing cinema like <B><A HREF="last_house_on_the_left2.htm">LAST
    HOUSE ON THE LEFT</A></B> (1972) and <B><A HREF="boys_next_door_1985.htm">THE
    BOYS NEXT DOOR</A></B> (1985), <B>MARAUDERS</B> is an intense and 
   gruesome portrayal of two vicious sociopaths named J.D. and Emilio 
   who violently leave their troubled lives at home behind and head out 
   on a rampage of killing and rape only to have one of them be hit by a 
   car and his leg injured. They head out to chase down the culprit 
   named David to get revenge on him and kill anyone who gets in their 
   way.&nbsp; David is out looking for his girlfriend as he wants to 
   take her to a cabin in the forest making her think she'll be safe but 
   it turns out he has sleazy plans of his own and is not much better 
   than the murderous scum tracking him down. Meanwhile, a gang of 
   vigilantes head out into the woods seeking to track down J.D. and 
   Emilio to get revenge on them for the carnage and chaos they've left 
   behind. <B><A HREF="marauders_1986.htm">MARAUDERS</A></B> is vicious, 
   disturbing, bloody, and brutal and is a film worthy of more attention 
   from today's SOV enthusiasts. Mark Savage is a very underrated 
   filmmaker. He created a beautiful artsy splatter film with <B>DEFENCELESS</B>,
    a film without dialogue that plays out much like a non-speaking 
   theatrical play with symphony music, hence the subtitle &quot;A Blood 
   Symphony.&quot; The Savage Sinema set is sadly out of print now due 
   to Subversive going under, but if you can find any films in the set 
   available separate and used for a good price, they're well worth 
   picking up. Subversive's 2-disc edition DVD of <B><A HREF="marauders_1986b.htm">MARAUDERS</A></B> 
   contains an audio commentary, a making-of documentary, a disturbing 
   short film from Savage called <B>STAINED</B> (2006), several 
   additional Savage short films, trailers, and much more. <B>MARAUDERS</B> 
   stars Zero Montana, Colin Savage (Mark's brother), Megan Spencer, and 
   Paul Harrington. If you want a good example of true Australian outlaw 
   filmmaking, look no further than the works of Mark Savage. Try to 
   hunt down the Savage Sinema set if you can. A Subversive Cinema DVD

   is highly enjoyable! It has to be one of the best shot on video

   and eats them while they're doing number 2. One guy plunging his

   around town with a bullhorn telling people not to use their toilets. 
   They say, &quot;If it's really an emergency, do what they did in the

    professor takes his students on a field trip to see UFO sightings in 
   rural Oklahoma. The area is being plagued by mysterious cattle 
   mutilations. Along the way, they run into a half-dead cow with its 
   flesh ripped off, a flying saucer, and a farmhouse with an old hermit 
   named Oliver Matson. They find themselves having to fight for their 
   lives as they get attacked by stop-motion animated alien monsters 
   inspired by Ray Harryhausen. This cheesy, local sci-fi/horror effort 
   shot in Oklahoma by writer-producer-director Larry Thomas (who as far 
   as I know has not done anything else that has been released) is an 
   okay timewaster for those who enjoy cheap '80s direct-to-video 
   schlock. One of the good things about it is that it appears to have 
   been shot on actual film instead of video (it was probably shot in 
   16mm and then transferred to tape). I'm guessing the budget was about 
   $10,000. The make-up and splatter effects (handled by much of the 
   same effects team that worked on <B><A HREF="blood_cult_1985.htm">BLOOD

   Originally a production of their old company In Hell Productions, <B><A HREF="nekro_1998b.htm">NEKRO</A></B> 
   takes place in a quiet neighborhood. A crummy-looking old van pulls 
   into a house's driveway. A dark-clothed, hooded man steps out 
   dragging into the house an unconscious woman. Once we enter a white 
   bedroom, the viewer is subjected to one of the most depraved, bloody 
   freak shows ever committed to celluloid (or video, can't tell what 
   format this was shot on) and when you're done watching it, all I can 
   say is you'll feel like you're going to hell for sure! Graphic sex, 
   rape, gore, and necrophilia all with a psychotic satanic atmosphere 
   to it crammed into a grimy little 16 minutes. That's the best way to 
   sum it up. Roth and Nards were obviously looking to sicken and offend 
   as many as possible, and it's safe to say they succeeded. Roth and

   with the head of a dead comedian he got from the morgue. He shows off 
   his &#147;re-animator serum&#148; and uses it to bring the head back 
   to life. The head comes back, tells a lot of bad jokes, and Edgar 
   sees fame and fortune. After Edgar&#146;s buddy&#146;s girlfriend 
   dies from falling and hitting her head on a concrete step, he uses 
   the serum to bring her back and she experiences the side effect 
   called &#147;Shrew Syndrome.&#148; Edgar says it only happens with 
   women and finds a cure for her. Later on the gangsters from the 
   beginning read about Edgar&#146;s discoveries in the local newspaper 
   and decide to enlist his help so they can bring their dead hooker 
   back to life. Edgar manages to bring her back to life and as

   she&#146;s a lot harder to reason with than the college girl who was 
   brought back, Edgar and the gangsters can&#146;t control her, and she 
   goes on rampage across the campus punching the heads off of 
   unsuspecting college boys. Edgar and the gang follow the trail of 
   decapitated heads until it brings them to the zombie bitch and leads 
   to the final confrontation. I&#146;m sad to say it, but this movie 
   could&#146;ve been so much more. It had the potential to be a really 
   funny low budget movie, but the jokes were so lame, it started to get 
   really annoying after a while. They&#146;re virtually no gore at all. 
   We just get some comical scenes of heads being punched off and flying 
   through the air but they&#146;re not bloody at all. Overall, it 
   would&#146;ve been better had they not did the same stupid jokes over 
   and over. I&#146;m glad to have a copy of the film, but I doubt 
   I&#146;ll ever watch it again. Director Judith Priest (who co-wrote

   think of ourselves and the effect religion has on us. Corrupt 
   businessman Franklin McDowell (Ron A. Blair) is going through a 
   stressful time in his life. His wife is cheating on him and it&#146;s 
   becoming evident that their marriage cannot go on. He decides 
   he&#146;s not going to let her get away with doing this to him and 
   packs up a gun and heads out with the intention of killing her. Along 
   the way he picks up a hitchhiker. Shortly afterward he pulls off the 
   road and attacks her. She gets out and runs into the woods and he 
   chases her down with a knife. When he catches up to her and attempts 
   to kill her he is confronted by a strange preacher dude. The preacher 
   convinces Franklin to let the hitchhiker go and he hitches a ride 
   with him. Along the way, the preacher starts talking about things 
   that strangely begin to reach into Franklin&#146;s inner character 
   and feelings and emotions that he&#146;s afraid to admit to. Franklin 
   keeps denying everything the preacher says of him. After shooting him 
   in the head, Franklin puts his body in a trash bag and takes it out 
   to the woods to bury it. But the preacher comes back and Franklin 
   beats him to death a shovel. He buries him and drives away hoping 
   he&#146;s dead, but not so. The preacher keeps coming back again and 
   again. Franklin can run over him with his car, shoot him, stab him, 
   burn him up, but he just can&#146;t kill him. It&#146;s apparent that 
   he&#146;s dealing with supernatural forces. He sees a lake turn into 
   blood and a fire-breathing dragon destroy a church. Can the forces 
   convince Franklin to admit to his mistakes and see himself for who he 
   is before he can kill his wife? <B>RECONCILED</B> is definitely one 
   of the most original religious-themed horror movies I&#146;ve ever 
   seen. The film turns out to be very effective and it delivers a very 
   powerful message about the influence of religion on society and the 
   way we view ourselves as human beings and innermost feelings we keep 
   locked up inside. This is a movie that horror fans should see at 
   least once for something different and something that seeks to 
   deliver a strong moral message. Fans of Tim Ritter&#146;s other 
   movies should find it interesting too despite it&#146;s lack of the 
   over-the-top gore that&#146;s prevalent in all his other movies. The 
   Sub Rosa DVD contains a commentary with Tim, behind-the-scenes 
   footage, making of special effects footage, and trailer. With Larry 
   Joe Treadway, Andrew Willett, Lori L. Holley, Kathleen Ritter, and

    story &quot;Anathema&quot; (directed by Ray Schwetz) tells us of a 
   man who moves into a new home after the death of his wife and son. 
   Soon enough, bizarre occurrences take place in the house, and a ghost 
   (played by Jasi Cotton Lanier) makes contact with him. The second 
   story &quot;The Creation of Dr. Grecoz&quot; (directed by Brian 
   Michael Finn) tells us of an eye surgeon who creates a new set of 
   eyes for his son who was scarred and lost his vision in a fire. 
   Thinking it's a miracle that he's finally able to see again, the son 
   soon comes to realize that his father really wasn't looking out for 
   the good of him but rather looking to exploit his loss of vision as 
   an opportunity to create a perfect child, so to speak, as a way to 
   fulfill a long kept fantasy of his. The third story 
   &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; (directed by Giovanni Piangiani) is a 
   giallo-style short thriller about an FBI agent (played by Joe Zaso 
   who also produced the anthology) who travels to Rome to investigate 
   the bizarre, ritualistic murder of his partner. He comes across a 
   Satanist who practices human sacrifices and a battle of good vs. evil 
   between the agent and Satanist wages on. <B>RED MIDNIGHT</B> is an 
   entertaining, low budget horror anthology that offers an array of 
   homages to many contemporary horror films, Asian flicks, and older 
   giallos from the 1970s. The set pieces are all very effective and the 
   wraparound segment with a psychic telling the stories to an audience 
   was quite an original touch I must add. Worth seeking out if 
   anthologies are your cup of tea. The Cinema Image DVD features 
   commentaries by Schwetz, Finn, Piangiani, and Zaso as well as 
   behind-the-scenes footage, still galleries, and trailers for other

   on the town and tells her to forget about him. They meet up with some

   her he still loves her. He breaks up the party by calling the police 
   and telling them there's a party going on with underage drinking and 
   loud music causing a disturbance. This forces Kim, Becky and the gang 
   to go party some place else in town. They decide to move the party up 
   to the infamous &quot;Redsin Tower,&quot; an ancient building where 
   an occultist by the name of Matteo Redsin practiced vicious human 
   sacrifices. The tower is believed by some townsfolk to still be 
   haunted by Redsin's spirit. Laughing those stories off, the gang ends 
   up partying in the tower, breaking out the music and booze and 
   getting ready for a night of fun and games and sex. Soon things start 
   to get weird as the kids one by one have encounters with the 
   supernatural. Mitch finds his way up to the tower and proceeds to 
   brutally hack up the partygoers in order to find Kim. A gore-drenched 
   bloodbath ensues involving demonic possession, maggot and worm

   encounters with otherworldly forces, and more. <B><A HREF="redsin_tower_2006b.htm">REDSIN</A></B>

    SPIRIT LAKE</A><A NAME="Red Spirit Lake"></A> (1993) - </B>Here's a 
   movie that gave me a headache the first time I watched it. It took me 
   two viewings before I could fully understand what it was all about. I 
   think it's better if you have a beer while watching it. It starts off 
   with a group of thugs led by a sleazebag named Diego torturing a 
   woman because they want her to sell them Red Spirit Lake. She refuses 
   and they end up killing her. We are then introduced to Marilyn 
   (Annabel Lee) who goes up to her Aunt Abigail's house at the lake to 
   take care of the place in the wintertime after her aunt dies. 
   Marilyn's great grandmother was supposedly a witch and there was a 
   history of witchcraft in her family. It appears as though the<A HREF="red_spirit_lake_1993.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/red spirit lake vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="154" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   spirits of witches haunt Red Spirit Lake. Marilyn has weird dreams 
   and sees witches or the ghosts of witches wandering around. Caretaker 
   brothers Matthias and Thomas tell Marilyn about how they met up with 
   angels and they help &quot;lock away the demons.&quot; Matthias and 
   Thomas were apparently abducted by aliens and operated on. They claim 
   it was angels. Thomas ended up with a scar on his forehead in the 
   shape of an X that oozes green stuff on occasion. Matthias 
   masturbates (in graphic detail) to Marilyn doing aerobics. Diego 
   still wants to get the lake and the house. He sends out two hired 
   killers to ice Marilyn. Thomas tries to fight one of them off but 
   ends up getting killed with a sledgehammer. Matthias shoots one and 
   the other runs off. Diego himself later shows up and drugs and rapes 
   Marilyn. Then one of the witches appears, bites his tongue out and 
   makes him cut his penis off. Marilyn's friends Shirley, Bob and Frank 
   who she invited earlier show up. Bob enjoys going into a hot sauna, 
   chanting &quot;om,&quot; then running out naked in the freezing cold 
   and snow, and running back in. The ghost of a witch shows up to give 
   him a blowjob and ends up &quot;disturbing his subtle energy 
   fields.&quot; He burns his hand on the sauna door and the witches 
   burn him to a crisp. Two of Diego's hired killers, Wesley and 
   Gabriel, show up. Gabriel ties up Shirley, undresses her, burns her 
   breast with a cigarette, then rapes her and slits her throat. Wesley 
   and Gabriel go after Marilyn and Frank. They both struggle. Frank 
   ends up having his brains blown out with a gun. The witches resurrect 
   Shirley and she throws Gabriel down on the kitchen table and fists 
   him up the ass. He hacks up blood and dies. The witches then lure 
   Wesley out into the snow. They dance around and Wesley undresses. He 
   then ends up freezing to death. In the end Marilyn is gunned down out 
   in the field by Matthias. He ends up with a scar on his forehead and 
   says, &quot;Angel's coming soon.&quot; This shot on video movie from 
   director Charles Pinion is hard to describe. It is absolutely one of 
   the weirdest, most offensive, vile, sickening and disturbing movies 
   I've ever seen. There were parts in it that I couldn't bear to watch 
   and I've seen some pretty horrendous things in movies before. There's 
   lots of extremely explicit male and female nudity and graphic sex 
   making it practically equivalent to soft-core porn. The film has some 
   pretty bloody scenes as well. While there is not quite as much 
   graphic gore as I was expecting, the violence has some sort of mean 
   streak to it, making it very unsettling in some places. I actually 
   felt like vomiting when I watched it the first time (the graphic 
   castration scene mentioned earlier is a prime example). It wasn't 
   quite as shocking the second time around. Director Pinion plays the 
   part of Matthias. With Holly Adams, Rick Hall, Bob Log, Jurgen 
   Straub, Richard Kern, Mark Adomaitis, Julie Marlow, Tessa

   Muzzy and Sarah (Billy Scam and Tiffany Stinky). Sarah is a

   his films. Trying to put the tragedy behind him, he goes back to his

   school friend named Ashley Lomack (Emily Haack). It turns out Ashley 
   is the sister of Mikki Lomack (Lisa Morrison) who survived the 
   original night in hell in the first movie. Mikki committed suicide a 
   few years after. Tyge's friend Deke (David Propst) is taking care of 
   a drifter named Zack (Eric Stanze). It appears Zack knows a good bit 
   about the original bloodbath from ten years earlier and the cursed 
   stones that turn people into flesh eating demons upon contact. The 
   stones re-emerge and eventually it leads to another night of hell on 
   earth as one unfortunate soul becomes possessed and the curse spreads 
   from one person to another via a sharp, oozing demon tongue. A 
   blood-gushing, innards splattered orgy of gory mayhem ensues 
   involving chainsaw dismemberments, a spike through one's eye, 
   impalements, a crotch chewed out with a chainsaw, crowbars through 
   heads, heads twisted off, legs pulled off, hearts ripped out, pickaxe

   spews other obscenities as well as lots of ethnic slurs, bashes a

   stabs, slashes and shoots three people in an adult movie theater, and 
   in the end finds himself on the run and unable to tell what's reality 
   and what's a dream in a very confusing ending. <B><A HREF="necromaniac_schizophreniac_2_2000.htm">NECROMANIAC</A></B> 
   continues Harry's adventures killing, torturing and having anal sex 
   with the dead bodies of his victims. Harry carries 
   &quot;Rubberneck&quot; around again, has a run in with Jesus, plays 
   obscene pranks at the drive-thrus of fast food joints, rants in 
   public, strangles an old lady, swears a lot, holds a couple 
   prostitutes hostage, and this time is being hunted down by Vegas 
   police (including an foul mouthed, racist asshole detective played by 
   Nick Palumbo) and the brother of one of his victims in the first 
   movie. The ending paves the way for a third movie that Atkins has in 
   the works right now as we speak. <B>SCHIZOPHRENIAC</B> and <B>NECROMANIAC</B> 
   are both incredibly offensive, brutal, gory, and showcase the 
   adventures of a psychopath who has it in for prostitutes, gays and 
   minorities with absolutely no regard for decency or morals 
   whatsoever. It's clear Ron Atkins really knew what he was going for 
   with making these two and Giancaspro's incredibly over-the-top acting 
   is something to see indeed. There's times when you feel like laughing 
   but it would be for all the wrong reasons. These two cult classics 
   are what I'd call the definition of &quot;sick.&quot; Politically 
   incorrect doesn't even describe them. They're indeed a love it or 
   hate it affair. Where do I stand? I really can't say for certain. 
   Atkins has certainly improved as a filmmaker with each movie. <B>SCHIZO</B>

   two examples of low budget filmmaking from a director who's very 
   inspired and not willing to be deterred by any constraints on 
   &quot;how far a movie can go.&quot; Watch them and decide for

   toes hacked off with an axe in a barn, and Leonard tying her up in 
   the shower videotaping her naked while he holds a razorblade to her

   to make a slasher movie together. When they film a scene of girl 
   being killed, Ralis goes too far and really kills her by cutting her 
   throat. Doug is shocked and scared at first, but decides to go along 
   with it anyway and they get rid of the body. They decide to start 
   picking people up off the streets and tell them they're going to be 
   in a horror movie. Little do these people know that they're being 
   tricked into starring in a snuff film. A guy's dick is sliced off and 
   he has it shoved down his throat, a girl has her face smashed with an 
   iron, a homeless person is drilled in the eye, another girl is cut in 
   half with a chainsaw, and one guy is half-decapitated with a machete.

   certainly isn't the worst of the bunch, but it's not very good

   described turn out to be the same as brutal murders of women that are 
   occurring as he writes the book. The alleged killer is shown at his 
   house ranting to himself, collecting cut outs from porn magazines, 
   and playing with lipstick. Michael receives tapes of the butchered 
   women before their deaths tied up naked to chairs by the killer and 
   saying, &#147;By the time you see this I will be dead&#148; and

    since birth, but they've all been so incompetent they couldn't kill 
   a cockroach. Melvin's dad asks him to hand him a fork to stick in the 
   toaster to fix it and dad gets electrocuted and the last thing he 
   tells Mel before he dies is to go out and kill. He adds that it must 
   be a sorority house filled with girls running around in lingerie. Mel 
   listens to what his father says, goes out in his welder's mask and 
   with his machete handy and tries to kill a few times but is 
   unsuccessful once again. He comes across the Ro-Ro-Ro Sorority House. 
   A bunch of college girls and guys throw a party at Ro-Ro-Ro one 
   night. He attempts to kill a girl in the shower but chickens out. 
   Later a girl goes into the bathroom to fix her hair. Mel shows up 
   behind her while she's looking in the mirror. He jumps up and down 
   and waves but this girl is so stupid she can't see that anybody's 
   standing behind her. She suddenly turns around and gets a machete in 
   her stomach. Mel has had his first kill. He then proceeds to 
   slaughter the rest of the partygoers in various gory ways (assorted 
   stabbings, machete through the brain, dismemberment, chainsaw 
   disembowelment, beer can in the eye, tree branch through the head, 
   etc.). Only one problem, one of the guests at the party who gets 
   hooked up with the nerdy girl of the sorority turns out to be 
   psychotic as well. When the two catch up with each other at what they 
   were intending to be a double murder, they get upset with each other 
   and decide it's war. It's a laugh-out loud splatter fest from there 
   on out. <B>SEVERE INJURIES</B> is perhaps my favorite film from Happy 
   Cloud Pictures. Amy Lynn Best directs and stars as the nerdy sorority 
   girl Lauren. She co-produced with Mike Watt (who wrote) and Ron Bonk.

   Lanier, Debbie Rochon, Ryli Morgan, Mark Baranowski and special

   and Fever Dreams Productions bring us a crazy genre-blending shot-on-digital
    effort that combines elements of zombie movies, women-in-prison 
   films, and Asian martial arts flicks all in the style of good old 
   1970's grindhouse cinema. Solitaire (Carla Greene), a tough young 
   black girl is sent to a maximum-security prison that is now a prison 
   for women. The<A HREF="shadow_dead_riot_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/shadow dead riot dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="123" HEIGHT="175" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   facility was once the scene of the execution of a serial killer, who 
   made a deal with the devil, known as Shadow (genre star Tony Todd) 
   years ago. The supernatural activity Shadow was involved in had an 
   effect on the other prisoners causing them to riot and be gunned down 
   by guards who took their bodies buried them beneath the lawn of the 
   prison. Shadow comes back from the grave with a vengeance and 
   unleashes the dead prisoners from underneath the prison yard lawn as 
   a horde of flesh eating zombies. This all happens after a prisoner 
   who cuts her foot trying to escape bleeds on the ground and down into 
   the soil. A tremendous amount of hell breaks loose with some serious 
   kung fu and ass-kicking scenes, zombies wreaking havoc in the prison, 
   a girl who gives birth to a mutant zombie baby, gore, guts, exploding 
   heads, and more. Solitaire proves herself to be very tough as she 
   fights off the mean girls of the prison, zombies, and Shadow in the 
   end. <B><A HREF="shadow_dead_riot_2006b.htm">SHADOW: DEAD RIOT</A></B> 
   is one wild ride for exploitation fans. It has everything fans could 
   ask for: Copious amounts of gore, nudity, sleaze, lesbians, zombies, 
   kung fu, references to other B-movies and horror classics, etc. The 
   cast also features Misty Mundae and Ruby LaRocca as well as little 
   cameo appearances by Bill Hinzman (&quot;Graveyard Zombie&quot;) as 
   &quot;Romero the Zombie&quot; and Captain Haggerty (&quot;Fat Zombie

    is a place with an awful past that no one in their right mind would 
   ever think about buying or even embrace the idea of throwing a party 
   in it. But, sure enough, some dimwit buys the place and plans a 
   Halloween party. One of his friends tells the partygoers a story 
   about the supernatural happenings believed to have taken place in the 
   old mansion years ago and the man who once lived there who murdered 
   his family. Throwing caution to the wind, the gang enters the place 
   thinking those stories about it being haunted are just hogwash. Soon

   disembowelment, torture, and mutilation. I seem to remember reading a 
   review where somebody said it ranks up with <B><A HREF="#Splatter Farm">SPLATTER

   wouldn't be nearly as effective if it weren't for the acting talents 
   of Brandon Salkil (who co-wrote the screenplay and is a regular 
   player and screenwriter in Mills' films) and Erin R. Ryan, who are so 
   good, I see nothing but great success in their future. And you would 
   think that with a title like this,<A HREF="skinless_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/skinless 2013 dvd8a front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   the film would be wall-to-wall gore, but while there is plenty to 
   keep gorehounds delighted, deep-down inside this is a parable about 
   how our current healthcare system ignores the dying when there are 
   treatments that can cure them (I, too, was a victim of that very same 
   corkscrew crooked healthcare system, where I learned that the FDA 
   does have a price limit on what it will spend to keep you alive, so 
   it is up to the suffering individual themselves to look for proven 
   treatments outside the United States, even if it means breaking 
   useless laws. A human life should have no price but, until we get the 
   FDA and the government to understand that dying people are willing to 
   try anything to stay alive, that is just what people like myself will 
   do. And I am still here because of it. I may have gone broke doing 
   it, but a person can always make more money. They can't make another 
   life.). The film opens with Dr. Alice Cross (Ryan) strapped to a 
   gurney, pleading for Pete (Salkil) to get some help, but Pete (who we 
   do not see in this sequence) tells Alice, &quot;That person...that 
   organism...no longer exists.&quot; The film then moves a couple of 
   months earlier, where a totally nude Pete and his also totally nude 
   &quot;girlfriend&quot; Olivia (Allison Fitzgerald) have just finished 
   making love (we see a nasty open sore on the backside of Pete's left 
   shoulder) and Olivia has to leave for her college finals, as soon as 
   she finds her panties (Pete thinks that sex is just sex and doesn't 
   mean it has to be a commitment). While Olivia is walking out of the 
   house, she meets Pete's partner in medical research, Alice, who gives 
   Olivia the cold shoulder, because there is some chemistry (pardon the 
   pun) between Pete and herself that goes back to when they were in 
   medical school together, but neither one of them ever acted on it. 
   When Olivia goes downstairs to the lab, Pete still has no pants or 
   underwear on, so she tells him to get dressed so she doesn't have to 
   stare at his penis (While there is full frontal nudity by both women, 
   we only get to see the naked ass of Pete. I am not gay, but I think 
   that films should start showing penises for the women and gay men, 
   because vaginas have been on film in a whole lot of low-budget genre 
   films throughout the years and I can count the times I have seen a 
   penis in these kind of films on one hand). It seems that Pete has 
   genetically invented a way to cure melanoma and all other kinds of 
   cancer and it is called a &quot;phasia worm&quot;, a 
   genetically-altered new life form that eats cancer cells until there 
   are no more left in the human body and then dissolves and is released 
   through the sweat glands. So far, Pete has only been able to use the 
   worm on human corpses, but the worm has a side effect: It also eats 
   the human skin. Pete and Alice do an autopsy on the only phasia worm 
   left and synthesize the chemical the worm secretes, so all they have 
   to do is inject live animals with the new serum to see the results. 
   Bad news comes when their chief financial contributor, Neil (Dave 
   Parker), refuses to fund them anymore until they come up with 
   results. Until then, his wallet is closed (and, yes, he's a prick). 
   Rather than wait 20 years for the FDA to approve the serum after many 
   clinical trials (and I firmly believe that the FDA would never 
   approve such drugs because their pockets are full of healthcare and 
   big pharm company's money). Pete decides to use the serum on himself, 
   since that large open sore on the back of his shoulder is melanoma 
   and, eventually, he will die from it. He shows Alice the huge sore 
   and what he is about to do, but she says if he uses the serum on 
   himself, she will never come back (which will hurt Pete more than he 
   knows because Alice is the only real friend he has had for most of 
   his life). But a dying man has to do what he has to do and, when 
   Alice leaves for the night, he injects himself with the serum and, 
   the next morning, the huge sore on his shoulder has disappeared. Pete 
   thinks he has finally created a cure for cancer. But like all good 
   intentions, it comes with a price, and Pete is about to experience 
   the mother of all problems. At first, everything is peaches and cream 
   for Pete, but his major stumbling block is that he can't tell Alice 
   what he has done. Then the situation begins to get very serious, as 
   he wakes up one morning with his shirt bloody where the sore 
   originally was. He takes off his shirt to discover that it is now 
   triple the size it was before and it is spreading. It seems the serum 
   is eating his skin like the worm did on the human corpses in his 
   trials. Two weeks pass and Pete has not answered any of the phone 
   calls or texts Alice has sent him, so she and Neil enter his house 
   and go down stairs to the lab. They find blood everywhere and Pete 
   has covered himself head-to-toe in medical scrubs, wearing what looks 
   like a rubber mask with a surgical mask and sunglasses. While Alice 
   is checking out another part of the lab, Pete takes off his mask and 
   excretes some kind of liquid right into Neil's face, making his skin 
   dissolve. He also pulls off Neil's right hand (the skin stretches 
   like cheese on a pizza) and, for good measure, removes Neil's lower 
   jaw with his bare hands. Pete goes to eat the jawbone, but Alice sees 
   it all and tries to escape the house. Pete captures her, knocks her 
   out and when she wakes up, she discovers she is locked in the attic 
   with no way to escape, while Pete wraps Neil's body in plastic and 
   puts it in another room. Pete then enters the attic, hands Alice some 
   toiletries and tells her the whole sordid story of what happened in 
   the past two weeks (via flashback). Pete takes cold showers and baths 
   as his skin dissolves to counteract the itching it causes and he 
   surgically removed his own face with a scalpel before it is eaten 
   away (that mask he wears is not rubber at all, but Pete's actual face 
   removed from his head!). He had also called Olivia over and invited 
   her to work with him over the Summer, but it was only a ruse. When 
   she arrived, he told Olivia to strip (&quot;Let me see your skin. 
   Come closer, let me touch you!&quot;) and he sprayed her with his 
   secretion over her whole body, making all the skin on her body 
   dissolve, Pete eating her flesh to survive (the serum has also given 
   him an extremely long, thin tongue, almost like a tentacle [a running 
   theme in a lot of Mills' films]). He wrapped Olivia's body in plastic 
   and puts it in the same room where he would eventually put Neil. 
   Alice is repulsed by the whole story, as Pete asserts his love for 
   her and says he has loved her since college, but he didn't want to 
   put their friendship in jeopardy. Alice says that she always loved 
   him, but only as a friend and she never had romantic feelings for 
   him, so Pete leaves the attic. Alice is forced to piss and shit in a 
   bucket (The last time I shit in a bucket was over 30 years ago when 
   me and a friend were driving in the middle of nowhere and I suddenly 
   got a case of explosive diarrhea [damn you scrapple!] and shitting in 
   a bucket is not as easy as it looks.). Alice finds an old photograph 
   of her and Pete in college, but more importantly, she find her small 
   canister of pepper spray hidden in her backpack which Pete missed. 
   Pete allows her to come downstairs after a couple of days to use the 
   shower and shes hides the small canister of pepper spray in her 
   vagina by cutting the strings on her tampons and using toothpaste as 
   glue (when toothpaste dries, it does have the elements of glue) to 
   attach them to the canister for easy removal (She is resourceful, 
   I'll give her that.). Pete gives her an ugly black dress and makes 
   her put it on in front of him (it looks like an ugly bridesmaid's 
   dress). Pete is obviously as mad as a hatter by now, as he tells 
   Alice the entire human race should be exactly like him. It seems that 
   the jawless Neil is not quite dead yet, as he rises from the plastic 
   and brandishes a gun he had on his body. Peter catches him <A HREF="ballad_of_skinless_pete_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/ballad of skinless pete poster8a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="203" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>just
    in time and beats him to death by pummeling his head into a bloody 
   pulp and then he exposes himself to Alice for the first time (It's a 
   really decent makeup job). Alice pulls her pepper spray from her 
   hoo-ha and uses it on Pete's face. His already skinless face become 
   gooier, as his long tongue wraps around a fleeing Alice's ankle and 
   pulls her towards him. He ties Alice to a chair and duct tapes her 
   mouth, as she watches Pete pull off a piece of Neil's flesh and eat 
   it off a plate like a normal person would eat dinner. Pete pulls the 
   duct tape off of Alice's mouth and once again tells Alice that he 
   loves her, but when he hears Alice say, &quot;Just because I was 
   being nice to you (in college) doesn't mean I was obligated to fuck 
   you!&quot;, he goes bonkers and squirts the pepper spray into Alice's 
   eyes. Alice wakes up wrapped in plastic in that special room that 
   Pete reserves for his victims, but she is really unable to see 
   because of the pepper spray. She is attacked by the monster dog Pete 
   experimented on (who he calls &quot;Itchy&quot;). The dogs goes to 
   grab her with its own long tongue, but Alice rips it from its mouth 
   and crushes Itchy's head with a crowbar. Alice tries to escape the 
   house with very blurry vision, but Pete is waiting for her at the top 
   of the stairs. We are now at the point where the film began: Alice 
   nude and strapped to a gurney, while Pete is about to do something 
   awful to her. Since he lost his penis and testicles to his disease, 
   he plans on impregnating her by sticking his long tongue into her 
   vagina (And they say oral sex doesn't cause pregnancy!). As his 
   tongue gets closer and closer to its destination, Pete finally gets a 
   conscience and rips his tongue out of his mouth, releasing Alice 
   before he dies. Alice cradles him before she shoots him in the head 
   with Neil's gun. Alice sits next to Pete's dead body crying her eyes 
   out and the film ends, proving that even monsters can redeem 
   themselves because there still is some semblance of humanity hiding 
   in their bodies.&nbsp; For a film only costing two grand, Dustin 
   Mills gets a lot of nasty gore, a literate screenplay and, 
   especially, believable acting from both Brandon Salkil and Erin R. 
   Ryan. He does this by keeping the cast down to four people and 
   filming everything on two sets. It's like a filmed play, but with 
   full-frontal nudity and bloody effects. Mills is a prolific director 
   and I haven't seen anything else he has done, but I will be 
   purchasing a few of his films to see if they keep the same standards 
   as this one. Clocking in at a small 80 minutes, the film doesn't 
   overstay its welcome and it looks decent for a filmed-on-digital-tape 
   film. These DTV/SOV films have improved a lot since the late-80's 
   &amp; 90's, so I plan on watching a few more to see if my mind has 
   changed about them. I seriously doubt they have acting as good as is 
   in this film, though. Recommended for people who don't mind horror 
   films with small casts and and underlining parable on what people 
   must do to stay alive when the government fails them. An <A HREF="http://mvdvisual.com">MVD

    tow them back to their place for help. One vacationing family ends 
   up being victim of one of their traps. Little does this family know 
   that these people are cannibalistic psychopaths. The mom has her 
   throat slit, the dad is sliced open like a fish, the young son is 
   split in half down the middle, and the big-brained son convinces his 
   family not to kill the teenage daughter. They hold the poor young 
   girl hostage. Brain-head really likes her. She tries to convince him 
   to let her go. In the meantime, anybody who comes into contact with 
   the psychotic family doesn&#146;t make it home alive. Some old dudes 
   show up (one of them is played by the legendary Forrest Ackerman). 
   One of them has their hand blown off with a small silver peace sign 
   that&#146;s actually a bomb. A couple others have the explosive 
   devices attached to their heads and the device is set off and their 
   heads explode. One old guy decides to get tough and go up against the 
   midget. This old dude mashes Warwick Davis&#146;s face into a bloody 
   pulp and rips his head off with his bare hands, tosses it through the 
   air and it lands on a couple&#146;s windshield while they&#146;re

   by strapping her to the front of their truck and driving her down the 
   desert highway. They come across a bunch of guys in a pick-up truck. 
   Our metal-jawed freak jumps onto the truck and starts slicing 
   everybody up. After running the truck off the road, they kill the 
   remaining survivor named Petey (played by New York actor Peter

   out on him and he eventually loses his job. He becomes obsessed with 
   adult film star Andromeda Strange (Caroline Pierce) and orders one of 
   her DVDs through her website. Andromeda is supposed to be one of the 
   nastiest S&amp;M fetish porn girls on the scene. Mike receives her 
   DVD in the mail. The DVD is a bizarre, transparent disc. He puts the 
   disc in and settles in with his hand lotion and proceeds to watch as 
   Andromeda engages in sick, sadistic sexual acts involving blood and 
   straight razors. Andromeda kills herself at the end by slitting her 
   throat. The next day, Mike puts the DVD in again, and Andromeda is 
   back (apparently a zombie) and begins pleasuring lucky guys in bed 
   before torturing and killing them in very graphic ways. Necrophilia, 
   close up penetration and oral sex, graphic slashings with razors, a 
   head gorily mashed to bits with a hammer, and other depraved acts 
   ensue. Once Mike realizes that Andromeda is really killing the people 
   in the video and sees her kill one of his friends, he proceeds to 
   tell authorities that a sick nymphomaniac is killing people on camera 
   and he's somehow able to see it all through the DVD, but to no avail. 
   Getting rid of the disc and getting Andromeda out of his life turns

   it is, the first ever movie to start a whole new genre of film called 
   &quot;Vomit Gore.&quot; Filmmaker Lucifer Valentine, a current 
   Canadian resident who was originally born and raised in South Africa, 
   graphically throws his depraved visions in our faces with this 
   disgusting, but yet oddly fascinating film. Reviled by some and loved 
   by others, I had often wondered which category I would fall into 
   after viewing it for the first time, and to be honest, I'd say my 
   overall view of it is neutral. It's a film that's definitely 
   unwatchable at times, but at the same time its story is rather 
   compelling and tragic. What's most disturbing is the fact that much 
   of it <A HREF="slaughtered_vomit_dolls_2006.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/slaughtered vomit dolls dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="201" HEIGHT="285" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>is
    based on things Lucifer Valentine had experienced in his life. 
   Raised by Satanist parents and also a Satanist himself, he spent a 
   good chunk of his life exploring the hardcore underground porn scene 
   and became acquainted with many actresses on this scene and has had 
   much interest in the XXX films of Max Hardcore who did a lot of vomit 
   fetish porn. A real-life vomit fetishist, or emitophile as it's 
   called, Lucifer Valentine's <B><A HREF="slaughtered_vomit_dolls_2006b.htm">SLAUGHTERED
    VOMIT DOLLS</A></B> stars Ameara LaVey (<I>who was murdered in Canad<FONT COLOR="BLACK">a</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="BLACK"> </FONT><I>on
    September 1, 2017</I>), once his real-life girlfriend, as a bulimic 
   wannabe dancer with a troubled past who resorts to becoming a porn 
   actress, a stripper and prostitute because she has no money and 
   nowhere else to go. LaVey's character in the film is actually based 
   on herself in real life and some snippets of home movies Lucifer made 
   with her while they were living together are edited into the film 
   throughout. We are treated to seemingly random moments where the 
   so-called &quot;Vomit Gore&quot; genre the film belongs to makes good 
   use of the term with incredibly sickening scenes of people puking on 
   each other, torture involving a girl's eyes plucked out and the 
   eyeballs are then vomited on, a guitarist hacking someone's arm off 
   and sticking the fingers down his throat to make himself puke while 
   on stage, and cannibalism in which a guy saws the top of someone's 
   head off, scoops out the brains and eats them and then pukes the 
   liquefied brains back into the open skull. He then proceeds to drink 
   the regurgitated remains and recycle them repeatedly by puking them 
   back up again, drinking them, puking them back up again, over and 
   over and over. In the end, the viewer is really left perplexed as to 
   what they just viewed and not really sure how to categorize it. The 
   film is gross, offensive, and disturbing, yet, it seems to work best 
   as an experimental feature. Those looking for something with an 
   experimental feel may want to give it a look at least once, but those 
   looking for traditional horror should best steer clear. In my view, 
   that's what best sums it up. Often compared with movies like <B><A HREF="cannibal_holocaust_1980.htm">CANNIBAL
    HOLOCAUST</A></B> (1980), <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Nekromantik">NEKROMANTIK</A></B>

   (2004), but in my opinion, the only comparison to those films lies 
   with the many controversial gore, violence and sex elements featured 
   throughout. Other than that, <B><A HREF="slaughtered_vomit_dolls_2006c.htm">SLAUGHTERED

    Anyone who enjoys watching people puking and re-puking fluids and

    blood crazed, homicidal slime monster. It appears as though the 
   neighbors are doing this to him in order to reincarnate the soul of a 
   dead alchemist named Zachary in his body. Alex's girlfriend takes 
   notice of his strange behavior and in the end she has to fight for 
   her life and go up against him in order to destroy Zachary's evil 
   spirit. This is a very campy and enjoyable low budget splatter 
   effort. Shot on 16mm on a budget of about $50,000. The film has some 
   really good gore scenes including some smashed heads, a gang member's 
   hand eaten by Alex's stomach and an incredibly slimy and over the top 
   finale where Alex's girlfriend hacks him to pieces in the apartment. 
   After she slices his stomach open with a knife, his intestines fall 
   out and he just picks them up and stuffs them back in. After she 
   chops his head off, his body still walks around and the head gives 
   orders. The craziest scene would have to be the head splitting open

   the movie is so laughably and disgustingly bad, you don't know 
   whether to laugh or puke your guts out. That's what makes it so fun 
   to watch. Twin brothers Joseph and Alan (Mark and John Polonia) go 
   out to visit their aunt who lives on a farm. What they don't know is 
   that their aunt's handyman named Jeremy (Todd Rimatti) is a 
   psychopathic, sadomasochistic necrophiliac who likes to hack people 
   up with farm and gardening tools and have sexual relations with the 
   dismembered body parts. In this movie you will see the following: 
   Jeremy using a severed arm and a decapitated head to pleasure 
   himself, one of the twins being drugged by his aunt so she can have 
   sex with him, a dream sequence where one of the twins craps up a big 
   butcher knife on the toilet and pulls his colon out through his 
   mouth, a male rape scene with fisting and pissing, frontal male 
   nudity, a cat eating vomit, little kids chocking on lye-laced 
   cocktails, etc. Yep, this is a movie that really takes pleasure in 
   grossing us out to the max. You can tell the movie had no effects 
   budget. There's lots of really cheap but extreme gore. The 
   screeching, high-pitched harpsichord and keyboard music score is 
   enough to make you want to take the gun to your head. You'd be pretty 
   hard pressed to find an actress worse than the one playing the aunt. 
   This is the type of movie you need to watch with a bunch of friends 
   when you're really drunk. The Polonia's went on to do several other 
   shot on video features (including a few with Jon McBride). Directed 
   by P. Alan and produced by J.K. Farlew. With Marion Costly, Jeff

   ways, this one is a little bit better than that movie. The wraparound 
   story of this anthology movie stars Shirley Latanya Jones from <B>BLACK
    DEVIL DOLL</B> as a mother whose son died years ago. The spirit of 
   her son apparently <A HREF="tales_from_the_quadead-zone_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/tales from the quadead zone vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="109" HEIGHT="211" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>lives
    inside a coffee cup (don't ask me where they got this idea) and the 
   cup floats around while she talks to it and reads it stories. She 
   finds a book called &quot;Tales From the Quadead Zone&quot; and reads 
   two stories. The first story is called &quot;Food For?&quot; and is 
   about a poor redneck family living out in the boonies who have a very 
   limited food supply. They argue and yell at each other a lot. One of 
   the sons eventually decides that death is the only way out of misery 
   for them and he grabs a shotgun and starts killing them all. The 
   second story is called &quot;The Brothers&quot; and is about two 
   black brothers named Ted and Fred who have always been enemies. Fred 
   dies from a heart attack and Ted decides to steal Fred's body from 
   the funeral home for some weird deed for personal reasons and ends up 
   conjuring up a demonic zombie clown killer with disastrous 
   consequences. The wraparound finishes off with Jones's husband coming 
   home. After he finds out that she's been talking to the cup, he beats 
   her and tries to kill her. The two of them struggle and she grabs a 
   knife and stabs him repeatedly in the stomach. While he's laying on 
   the kitchen floor bleeding to death, he manages to get to the 
   telephone and call the cops. When the cops show up and find the 
   husband dead they tell Jones that they're taking her in. She tells 
   the cops she needs a minute before she leaves and goes into the 
   bathroom and cuts her own throat with a razor. The ghost of the dead 
   mother and son still inhabit the house in the end. This ultra-obscure 
   no budgeter isn't quite as weird as <B>BLACK DEVIL DOLL</B>, but it 
   is a very original movie in itself and all the stories are very 
   creative. Unlike Turner's previous film, this one actually has some 
   gore and bloody death scenes and it doesn't have an all-black cast. 
   Good luck finding it. You may be able to find some DVD-R's floating 
   around that are really cheap, but the last original VHS that I saw on <A HREF="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</A> 
   went for over $70! Luckily I was able to get mine from <A HREF="http://www.cinemawasteland.com">Cinema

    TILL THE END</A><A NAME="TalesTillTheEnd"></A> (1996) &#150;</B> 
   Another shot-on-video anthology from Phil Herman and Falcon Video. 
   Three friends Parker (played by Phil Herman), Damien and John get 
   together and soon find out that the US is under a state of emergency 
   as an experimental chemical has caused a poisonous outbreak that has 
   wiped out all of Europe and is headed to the US. The poison turns its 
   victims into flesh hungry cannibals. It&#146;s become evident that 
   the end of civilization may be near. The three drive around till they 
   find an area where they&#146;ll be safe. They find their way to an 
   underground hideout and bring all their belongings from their car. 
   While hiding from the deadly outbreak, the three of them decide to 
   tell stories about incidents that had recently happened to them. 
   Damien tells the story about the knife of a homicidal maniac that he <A HREF="tales_till_the_end_1996.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/tales till the end vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="136" HEIGHT="196" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>found.
    It turns out the knife is beholden to some supernatural force and it 
   causes Damien to go ballistic and start killing his friends until one 
   of them tries to get the knife out of his hands to break the curse. 
   Parker tells the story about his experiencing filming a low budget 
   horror movie that turns out to be <B><A HREF="#BurglarFromHell">BURGLAR
    FROM HELL</A></B> (1993) and his quest to get a distributor. He 
   talks with several actors including Joel D. Wynkoop. Joel tells him 
   about all the movies he&#146;s done including <B><A HREF="truth_or_dare_1986.htm">TRUTH
    OR DARE</A></B> (1986), <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Killing Spree">KILLING
    SPREE</A></B> (1987), and <B><A HREF="wicked_games_1994.htm">WICKED GAMES</A></B> 
   (1994). The distributor who Parker finds tells him he likes the story 
   and is willing to distribute the movie. But when he takes the movie 
   to him and tells him it&#146;s shot on video, the distributor tells 
   him there&#146;s nothing he can do with it and he wants something 
   shot on film and calls Parker a &#147;piss clam.&#148; After taking 
   this rejection, Parker gets mad and takes the <B>BURGLAR FROM HELL</B> 
   tape, stabs it with a knife and then stabs the distributor in the 
   chest with the knife and the guy dies with a <B>BURGLAR FROM HELL</B> 
   VHS pinned to his chest. John tells the third and final story about a 
   disingenuous housewife Jessie (Debbie D) and how she cheats on her 
   husband with every man in the neighborhood. Her husband Jim is well 
   aware of the affairs she&#146;s having but doesn&#146;t want to come 
   out and admit it for fear of putting her through too much pain. In 
   the story, John is somebody who has a crush on Jessie, but she keeps 
   rejecting him. After Jessie and Jim finally come face to face about 
   the fact of her affairs, he straps her to a chair and proceeds to cut 
   her fingers off one by one for every time the phone rings and nobody 
   answers. After losing two fingers, John comes in and beats Jim to 
   death and hopes he&#146;ll be able to sweep Jessie off her feet for 
   saving her life. Unfortunately she continues to reject him and brush 
   him off as a loser. He then proceeds to finish the job her husband 
   started by cutting off her fingers for every time the phone rings and 
   their isn&#146;t an answer. She eventually bleeds to death. After 
   Parker, Damien and John are all done telling stories, Damien and John 
   become flesh-eating cannibals and Parker finds he&#146;s immune to 
   the toxic chemical. He&#146;s then left to fend for himself. <B>TALES 
   TILL THE END</B> is nowhere near as entertaining as <B><A HREF="#Horrortales666">HORRORTALES.666</A></B> 
   nor does it have the charm of <B>BURGLAR FROM HELL</B>, but it&#146;s

   somehow impregnated her with bug parasites. She dies after giving 
   birth to jumbo-sized killer bug creatures and they cause trouble for 
   Don, Fred and Doug in the cabin during a blackout. Fred mysteriously 
   disappears and Don and Doug try to find him while fighting off the 
   giant bugs. This ultra low budget Super 8 vomit fest from Toronto is 
   definitely one of the worst atrocities ever committed to film. Yet 
   it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen too! Porn star Amber 
   Lynn plays a TV news reporter who reads her lines off of cue cards. 
   This is her first non-adult movie. They throw in references to George 
   Romero and Traci Lords. There's also a scene where the guys make fun 
   of a cheap horror movie playing on TV. We get lots of extreme (but 
   amateurish) gore effects, slime, puking, paper mache bug puppets, and 
   outrageous dialogue. My favorite lines are &quot;Does a toilet flush 
   in a blackout?&quot; &quot;Oh my god! I hammered your head in! Are 
   you alright?&quot; and &quot;Little fuckers! Come back with my 
   eyeball!&quot; Get this one if you need a good laugh. Barry J. Gillis

    threatens the hooker with a gun and ties her up to a chair. She then 
   proceeds to tell her two stories. The first story, &#147;The 
   Box,&#148; concerns a group of hookers who travel out to a small town 
   in the desert to move into an old theater. They bought the theater 
   thinking it would make a good whorehouse. The mayor of the town is a 
   very creepy dude. He doesn&#146;t seem to take too kindly to whores 
   hanging out in his town. He then unleashes a slimy slug-like monster 
   with a nasty set of teeth that lives in a box on the group of 
   hookers. The &#147;thing&#148; burrows into people&#146;s stomachs 
   and eats their guts. The second story, &#147;Thing in a Jar,&#148; 
   concerns a woman (Courtney Lercara from Tim Ritter&#146;s <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Killing Spree">KILLING

   killing her and dismembering her. She has a dream where he cuts her 
   eyes out, one where he throws her against a door and she gets her 
   teeth knocked out and another where he snaps her hand off. She tells 
   her best female friend about the dreams. Her friend warns her that 
   her dreams might be trying to tell her something and she should leave 
   her husband now before the nightmares become real. Little does she 
   know that her friend and husband already have a plan to kill her and 
   bury her body, move out of town and take her money. After being 
   stabbed by her husband, she comes back and attacks her husband and 
   her friend while they&#146;re making love (they thought she was 
   already dead). She then ends up with her eyes cut out, her hands 
   chopped off and her teeth pulled out. They bury the body in the front 
   yard and put her clown jar where she was keeping money on top of the 
   soil with the eyes, hands and teeth inside and dump acid in it to 
   destroy the evidence. Over night, the acid somehow causes the 
   dismembered body parts to morph together into a bloody, gooey, slimy 
   intestine monster with hands, eyes and teeth. It bites the 
   husband&#146;s hand off. The girlfriend then finds his mutilated body 
   in bed with the eyes ripped out. The intestine monster then proceeds 
   to strangle her to death. When the forensics find the dead bodies,

   weird, funny, gory, and sick zero budget shot-on-video effort 
   concerning a young skateboarding kid who gets killed by a gang of 
   drug addict punks after they give him a hard time and he retaliates. 
   After running him over with their car, a Frankenstein wannabe doctor 
   and his female assistant find his body in the parking lot and take 
   him back to their lab where they manage to re-animate him. He wakes 
   up with a bandaged face and <A HREF="twisted_issues_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/twisted issues vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="194" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>skin
    from his face grafted to his legs. He goes ballistic and kills the 
   doctor with a steak through the heart and demands his assistant give 
   him his skateboard back. The skateboard has the wheels broken off of 
   it and he takes a power drill, drills a hole through his foot and 
   nails the skateboard to it. He then proceeds to do away with the gang 
   of druggies and their friends in ultra-gory ways. While this is all 
   going on we are shown a young man named Charles (played by director 
   Charles Pinion himself) and his girlfriend watching all the events 
   involving the skateboarder and his friend on television and the two 
   of them fight and kill each other but keep coming back to life. 
   Throughout the movie we are shown television clips of the Pope, 
   Ronald Reagan, politicians, evangelists, NASA footage, old 
   Nazi/Hitler film footage, the famous &#145;80s &#147;brain on 
   drugs&#148; anti-drug ad, punk rock music videos and various punk 
   bands are featured on the soundtrack throughout. Like Pinion&#146;s

   seems to be in a league of its own. I&#146;d say Pinion&#146;s work 
   is most comparable with that of Jim VanBebber and the works of Nick

   own pirated cable TV show in which they review snuff films that

   commercial for a toy critter named Wilbur that eats the throats out 
   of little boys, a small town sheriff and his wife putting a criminal 
   in an electric chair in their basement and making his head explode

   is actually man who chose to become a dog. They do experiments with 
   drugs and the uncle comes up with a green concoction that they refer

   Sheets movies are the kind that you watch with friends on rainy

   While the <B>ZOMBIE BLOODBATH</B> trilogy definitely isn't the best 
   of his work, the movies are a decent example for young filmmakers out 
   there trying to get an idea of how things work in the low budget and 
   home video movie market. <B><A HREF="zombie_bloodbath_1993.htm">ZOMBIE

   Zombies show up and eat people and people melt into puddles of goo. 
   Some town folk find themselves running afoul of the rampaging 
   zombies. It appears the nuclear power plant was built over an Indian 
   burial ground. The one thing about Todd's movies is that they don't

    sequel to his 1993 SOV zombie fest is definitely a step up from the 
   last one. We start off with some guys robbing a farmer and his wife 
   at their farmhouse. They torture the wife and demand that the farmer 
   give them his goods. Demons and zombies show up. One guy is eaten and 
   another is crucified, has a scarecrow hood sewn<A HREF="zombie_bloodbath_2_rage_of_the_undead_1995.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/zombie bloodbath ii rage of the undead vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="104" HEIGHT="190" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   to his face and is turned into a scarecrow. Years later a group of 
   friends go out into the countryside on a vacation and their van 
   breaks down. Three convicts escape from a nearby prison. A couple 
   thieves hold up the local deli in town. The group of friends finds 
   their way to a farmhouse where the three convicts are holding some 
   young girls hostage after killing their mother and father. The 
   scarecrow comes to life after being disturbed and raises the dead 
   from their graves. All chaos ensues as zombies surround the farmhouse 
   and everybody tries to escape. The ones that manage to get out alive 
   find their way into town and meet up with the two thugs terrorizing 
   everyone at the local deli. It&#146;s a nonstop chunk blowing gore 
   and guts fest from there on out. Todd Sheets piles on the gallons of 
   stage blood and buckets of innards from the slaughterhouse once 
   again. Zombies pop a guys eyeballs out of his head and pull his 
   brains out through his eye sockets, a guy is tortured by having 
   broken glass in a white paper bag dumped down his throat, a girl has 
   a gun set off between her legs blowing a hole in her nether regions, 
   one girl is forced to jump up and down barefoot on broken glass, a 
   guy has a knife shoved up under his chin and the blade bursts out 
   through his tongue inside his mouth (you get to see it in a POV shot 
   from inside the mouth), zombies munch on flesh, tongues are bit out, 
   stomachs, intestines and liver are ripped out, a zombie has a crowbar 
   shoved through its mouth and out the back of its head, a guy is 
   stabbed in the gut, and the heroine of the movie finds flesh eating 
   bacteria in an abandoned truck and dumps it on the zombies causing 
   some incredibly icky meltdown scenes with zombies melting into bloody 
   messes and their heads exploding. If gore is what you&#146;re looking 
   for, you&#146;ve come to the right place. With Dave Miller, Kathleen

   Todd Sheets. In ZB3 we start out hundreds of years into the future 
   where soldiers are taking control of government-made flesh eating 
   zombies in a cave. The zombies are rounded up and put in a large 
   capsule and loaded onto a shuttle where they are launched into space

   students are doing detention time ala <B><A HREF="breakfast_club_1985.htm">THE

   own radio broadcast in the basement, and an actor is teaching martial 
   arts in the school gym. The nerds of the story uncover the shuttle 
   from the future underneath the school. They run into some zombies and 
   eventually all hell breaks loose. The students in detention, the 
   actor and sidekick, and the nerds find themselves fighting for their 
   lives as the flesh hungry zombies overrun the school. From there on 
   out, it&#146;s gore galore with spilled intestines, organ eating, 
   flesh ripping, dismemberments, etc. A zombie chows down on a severed 
   arm, the school principal is munched on and later comes back as a 
   zombie himself, one of the nerds stabs a zombie in the eye repeatedly 
   with an electric carving knife and then saws its head off, necks are

    I&#146;ll just say this, don&#146;t watch it expecting good acting 
   or for story. Watch it for all the flesh eating and gut spilling 
   action. Since it&#146;s been a while since I last watched this one, 
   I&#146;ll try to summarize it the best I can. It starts out with a 
   gang fight scene at the beginning with a fast-paced punk rock version 
   of &#147;Spirit In The Sky&#148; playing on the soundtrack. A guy who 
   was just heading to a train station minding his own business to go to 
   a reunion and meet up with some friends ends up in the middle of 
   nightmarish chaos with zombies, gangs and homicidal maniacs running 
   rampant. We are then treated to many scenes of characters running 
   away from zombies, zombies chowing down on human innards and other 
   organs and body parts, karo syrup goop and blood dumped all over the 
   actors, zombie ass kicking, gang action, etc. One girl is stabbed 
   through the side of her face with a knife. In one scene the zombies 
   eat a baby out of a stroller. The film has a really kick ass 
   soundtrack. Todd is a guy who really knows how to score a movie. Like 
   I said, don&#146;t watch it for plot or acting, watch it for all the 
   zombie action, crazy editing, cheesy effects, and soundtrack. The 
   &#147;Director&#146;s Cut&#148; VHS contains a &#147;making of&#148; 
   segment after the feature with behind-the-scenes footage, outtakes,

   elements of Monty Python, Peter Jackson, George Romero and Andreas 
   Schnaas is definitely one of the stupidest and most outrageous pieces 
   of zero budget backyard slime on the home video market. The plot (if 
   you can even call it that) concerns two guys who get turned into 
   zombies after coming into contact with a dead horse. They end up 
   contaminating a yeast field. Some weird Nazi-wannabes get a hold of 
   the yeast and decide to put it in bottles so they can distribute it 
   around the world and infect people. This leads to some unfortunate 
   results for them. End of story. You get some extremely cheap gore, 
   torture, zombies vomiting and defecating on each other in graphic 
   detail, bottles getting up by themselves and attacking people, and a 
   guy who gets all his limbs hacked off and is carried away at the end 
   by a Mary Poppins on crack (I'm not kidding). I swear, this movie was 
   probably some experiment to see how much toilet humor and sick, 
   idiotic, outrageous, over-the-top and ridiculously exaggerated 
   graphic scenes could be crammed into 75 minutes. It's one of those 
   things that must be seen to be believed. I don't know how else to 
   describe it. In any event, you'll definitely laugh until you puke. 
   Directed by and starring Thomas J. Moose. With Adrian Ottiwell, Lee 
   Simpson, and Robert Taylor. A <A HREF="http://www.shock-o-rama.com">Shock-O-Rama
