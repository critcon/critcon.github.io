    perhaps have<!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/red necks in love book.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="79" HEIGHT="119" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"> 
    seen at least one film involving George &quot;Buck&quot; Flower. A 
    real curio is the way which I could make contact with this actor. The 
    thing is that one night I received an e-mail from a person who 
    informed me that, in addition to his work as a player, George 
    &quot;Buck&quot; Flower had also written a fiction with that well-known
     player, Charles Napier. It made clear reference to &quot;Red Necks 
    in Love&quot;, &quot;, a book which had already been published and is 
    available through Barnes &amp; Noble. So, I responded to this 
    mysterious person asking him whether he had by chance images or 
    stills of this &quot;slippery&quot; player. The matter is that for 
    almost 40 years, Flower has been playing all kind of roles in films, 
    specializing in playing older men or the drunkard type (or as ol' 
    drunkards). Since in most films (the most known ones) he shows up 
    just a little time in the screen, it was really hard to obtain any 
    snapshot of him. I remember that I've spent a long while searching 
    the whole net in order to get any kind picture of him to put it in my 
    website, <A HREF="http://www.cinefania.com">Cinefania.com</A>. So, 
    when this unknown person responded, the amazing fact was that HE was 
    the real George &quot;Buck&quot; Flower! The rest of our conversation 
    is developed below, for the delight of all those cinephiles 
    interested in learning something else on... ...</FONT><BR>

     Universal</B>: Okay, in order to break the ice, let's go straight: 
    is it true that something happened between you and Dyanne Thorne?</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>George Buck Flower</B>: Dyanne 
    and I have been good friends for over three decades and remain so to 
    this day. She was, is and always will be, a very classy lady. We also 
    had a great screen relationship. I loved acting with the lady and 
    always got along quite well with the only boyfriend I ever knew her 
    to have prior to her marriage to her present husband. With whom, by 
    the way, I am also friends.</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Terror Universal</B>: When did 
    you know that you'd become a film player?</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>George Buck Flower</B>: I 
    first knew I had become an actor back in either the late fifties or 
    early sixties when I realized the Government had deducted taxes from 
    my check for performing such services. This, job, by the way, was for 
    an on stage portrayal of The Young Gentleman in the play Le Ronde, at 
    the Summerhouse Theater in Albuquerque New Mexico.</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Terror Universal</B>: What 
    about your early efforts in the industry?</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>George Buck Flower</B>: I 
    worked as an actor, director and stage manager in theatre all over 
    the continental U.S. including two repertory tours of Alaska for 
    about ten years. Then, sometime in the early to mid sixties,( check 
    imdb for the exact year) I was doing a play at a small theatre in 
    Santa Monica, California. The director (Ted Roter) was getting ready 
    to direct his first movie, entitled <B><A HREF="norma.htm">NORMA</A></B>.
     He asked me if I would play the role of the killer in his upcoming 
    film project whom the audience would think was a man, then discover 
    at the end to really be a woman. The role had no lines and I really 
    hadn't envisioned my first motion picture role to be in drag, but I 
    really did want to be in a movie. I said yes and, at the appropriate 
    time, donned the dress. During the filming, when I wasn't playing the 
    man who turned out to be a woman, I pitched in and helped carry 
    equipment. I didn't know any better. In theatre, everybody does 
    everything. I wasn't asked to play any more women, but, due to my 
    other efforts, I was offered job to work on the crew for yet another 
    movie. I turned in my dress for more masculine attire and accepted. ( 
    I had three children to feed, and my wife was getting tired of 
    picking up the whole tab.) After working a few films in this new 
    capacity, I became an assistant director. Then, finally, I was asked 
    to do more acting. These first roles were indeed those of the male 
    gender, but required some nudity. I didn't care. I was in the 
    movies!! However, after viewing me with my clothes off in a couple of 
    these low budget wonders, those in charge decided it would be better 
    for the viewers in the future to pay me a little more if I promised 
    to keep them on.</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Terror Universal</B>: During 
    the 70s. you participated in some sexploitation films of <B><IMG SRC="images/george buck flower photo3.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="297" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></B>the
     Ilsa saga, considered today really cult films and very desired by 
    fans. Which are your memories of those productions?</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>George Buck Flower</B>: 
    Regarding the Ilsa films: In addition to working as an actor on the 
    first and second, I also functioned as the casting director on the 
    latter. We labored hard, but the results speak for themselves. Since 
    that time, I also became the director, Don Edmund's assistant 
    director on several films, including <B><A HREF="bare knuckles.htm">BARE
     KNUCKLES</A></B>. He remains a valued friend to this day as do many 
    others with whom I became aquatinted on those films.</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Terror Universal</B>: Indeed, 
    in those years you worked with B-directors the likes of Bill Rebane, 
    who directed you in some films like <B><A HREF="alpha incident.htm">ALPHA
     INCIDENT</A></B> and <B><A HREF="capture of bigfoot.htm">CAPTURE OF BIGFOOT</A></B>.
     What was like working at that time and which was Rebane's film 
    methods, plus those of other similar directors you worked with?</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>George Buck Flower</B>: Bill 
    Rebaine's whole family worked on his films. Those of us lucky enough 
    to be hired to help do his movies became part of that family. Bill, 
    like so many others, was considered to be a &quot;B&quot; director 
    because he was never able to raise enough money to do what is 
    considered to be an &quot;A&quot; film.</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Terror Universal</B>: In 1980 
    you played the &quot;Tommy Wallace&quot; part in John Carpenter's <B><A HREF="fog.htm">THE
     FOG</A></B>. Was this your first collaboration with this director? 
    What's your relationship with Carpenter? Which is his filming method?</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>George Buck Flower</B>: <B>THE FOG</B> 
    was indeed my first film for John Carpenter. It was a lucky day for 
    Buck Flower<!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="images/george buck flower photo4.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="139" HEIGHT="176" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"> 
    when his partner at the time, Deborah Hill, who has worked as a 
    script girl on several films where I was assistant director, gave me 
    a chance to read for that talented man. John is very a very special 
    filmmaker. He has already shot every angle of the movie inside his 
    head prior to arriving on the set. He is also a master of 
    communication. If one doesn't know what's going on at all times 
    during a Carpenter shoot, one wasn't paying attention. He is also 
    very quiet for the most part. John knows he's the director and seems 
    to feel there is no reason to remind people of that fact.</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Terror Universal</B>: In <B><A HREF="back to the future.htm">BACK
     TO THE FUTURE</A></B> (1985), your character went straightly around 
    the world, and achieved public of all-known extraction (not only the 
    science-fiction type). What's like to become a well-known screen face?</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>George Buck Flower</B>: Since, 
    for the most part, especially in <B>BACK TO THE FUTURE</B> <B>1</B>&amp;<B><A HREF="back to the future 2.htm">2</A></B>,
     I always portray extreme characters, very few people recognize my 
    face. Considering the roles I play, it's probably just as well.</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Terror Universal</B>: How and 
    when was born that threatening character -a cross between a drunkard 
    and a tramp- which you've so well developed throughout a big variety 
    of films?</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>George Buck Flower</B>: 
    Probably because I look like a dirty drunk and a drifter. They say we 
    play best what we are. God! I hope that's not true.</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Terror Universal</B>: Of your 
    whole filmography, which ones are your favorite films?</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>George Buck Flower</B>: With 
    only a few exceptions, all the films I have been fortunate enough to 
    appear in in are my favorites in one way or another. Among the 
    forerunners, however, are <B><A HREF="butterfly.htm">BUTTERFLY</A></B>,

    and a new one I'm just finishing, entitled <B><A HREF="they_are_among_us_2004.htm">THEY
     ARE AMONG US</A></B>.</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Terror Universal</B>: You 
    talks about <B>BUTTERFLY</B> (1982), a controversial movie of his 
    time (I suppose by erotic scenes and incest theme). You have a role 
    in this, and I noted the presence of big Orson Welles. Do you meet him?</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>George Buck Flower</B>: <B>BUTTERFLY</B> 
    was not only the best movie Matt Cimber ever directed, it was also 
    Pia's finest performance. Unfortunately, the controversy surrounding 
    this show, adapted from the novel to the screen by John Goff, was 
    neither erotic scenes or incest theme. It was the fact that Pia's 
    husband (Quite a bit older than she was,) financed the film. Once she 
    won the Golden Globe award that year for best Actress in the same 
    movie, a sort of boycott began to take place. It was really a shame. 
    As for Orson: Except for the big man, everyone on that film was 
    wonderful to work with. No one can deny, however, his status as one 
    of the world's greatest actors. My memories of doing scenes with him 
    are not at all pleasant, but watching those same scenes later, indeed were.</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Terror Universal</B>: One of 
    the movies reviewed by me is <B>CAPTURE OF BIGFOOT</B> (directed by 
    your &quot;familiar&quot;, Bill Rebane). My last question its about 
    this movie, do you have some memory of this particular?</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>George Buck Flower</B>: I 
    remember it was very cold and they had to keep reshooting my dog sled 
    scenes because I kept falling off. I also recall that Bigfoot's 
    costume (We all called it his 'Bunny Rabbit suit') kept freezing to 
    his skin and he finally quit. The 'Bunny Rabbit suit' had to be 
    altered to fit another Bigfoot because the original was seven feet 
    two inches and his replacement was only six feet seven inches tall. 
    Capture of Bigfoot was one more movie in which I had the pure 
    pleasure to work with John Goff. John is probably the most talented 
    man I have ever met, both as writer and actor. He is indeed one of 
    the unsung heroes of the motion picture business over the last thirty 
    years. I have no idea why he's not as famous as Orson. John is 
    definitely nicer than Welles ever was.</FONT><BR>

    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B><IMG SRC="images/george buck flower photo5.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="244" HEIGHT="297" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0">Terror
     Universal</B>: When you made <B>IN SEARCH OF A GOLDEN SKY</B> 
    (1984), you worked with this marvelous big character actor named 
    Cliff Osmond. I don't know now if Osmond is alive, but I have a sweet 
    memory of him, from <B>KISS ME STUPID</B> (1963), <B>FRONT PAGE</B> 
    (1974), millions of TV Show episodes, and... (hehe)... <B>SHARK'S TREASURE</B> 
    (1975), a little and cool adventure-ship movie with Cornel Wilde 
    which I see when a boy. Do you remember Cliff?</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>George Buck Flower</B>: I also 
    have great memories of Mr. Osmond. Like you, I was a great fan of his 
    work long before I had the pure pleasure of witnessing him first hand 
    in a movie I helped to write with John Goff. Working in front of the 
    camera with this tremendous talent was an additional bonus I will 
    always cherish. I'm not sure, but I don't think Cliff's with us 
    anymore. If this is true, more's the pity. *</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Terror Universal</B>: In <B><A HREF="maniac cop.htm">MANIAC
     COP</A></B> (1987), directed by William Lustig and produced by Larry 
    Cohen, were gathered B-class icons the likes of William Smith, 
    Richard Roundtree, Robert Z'Dar and Bruce Campbell. Had you any 
    chance to get to known them closely?</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>George Buck Flower</B>: I had, 
    the pleasure of being friends with William Smith long before <B>MANIAC
     COP</B>. I am proud to state that the friendship still exists. I 
    also knew Robert Zdar before <B>MANIAC COP</B>. I helped launch his 
    career. His first sizable role in a movie was the muscle bound 
    monster killer in <B><A HREF="night stalker (1986).htm">THE NIGHT STALKER</A></B> 
    (1987) which I line produced for Don Edmunds. I didn't really get to 
    know Bruce Campbell until I did <B><A HREF="sundown.htm">SUNDOWN, 
    VAMPIRES IN RETREAT</A></B> (1987), for Anthony Hickox. I'm not sure 
    when I became aquatinted with Roundtree. I think it was not until 
    later when I played the drunk convention dude on an episode of <B><A HREF="outlaws.htm">OUTLAWS</A></B> 
    in which he starred with Rod Taylor and my close friend Charles 
    Napier who is also Co-writer of my published <B>RED NECKS IN LOVE</B>.</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Terror Universal</B>: In <B>PUMPKINHEAD</B> 
    (1988) you can work with that genius, Stan Winston. Tell us something 
    about him.</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>George Buck Flower</B>: 
    Working with Stan Winston was a very pleasant experience. The man is 
    not only extremely creative, he is also a true gentleman with a 
    wonderful sense of humor.</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Terror Universal</B>: In the 
    90s. we enjoyed a lot your work in those widely shown films like <B><A HREF="body_bags.htm">BODY
     BAGS</A></B> (1993) or <B><A HREF="village of the damned.htm">VILLAGE

    entries like <B><A HREF="moonbase.htm">MOONBASE</A></B> and <B><A HREF="vampire_club.htm">BLOODSUCKERS</A></B>.
     Has the industry changed from the Seventies on, or is that 
    everything continues being equal?</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>George Buck Flower</B>: Maybe 
    the film industry has changed. I'm not sure. I do know most of the 
    people I didn't piss off are no longer in power.</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Terror Universal</B>: In 
    addition to your player role, you have written the scripts of some 
    films, and worked in several other occupations. Which ones of these 
    jobs have given you more satisfactions?</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>George Buck Flower</B>: There 
    is only one good job on a movie set. Actor!! It's the only position 
    where you are responsible to only yourself. Screen writer is, among 
    the positions I have held, the biggest heartbreaker. I believe it was 
    Earl Felton who said.&quot;You know you have a good story when 
    everyone involved wants to write their own version.&quot; About the 
    only good experience I have enjoyed, (Other than the money) in that 
    capacity was on the original set of <B>IN SEARCH OF A GOLDEN SKY</B>, 
    directed by Jef Richard and the little T&amp;A comedies I wrote with 
    Ed Hansen who also directed. (<B><A HREF="bikini_carwash_company.htm">BIKINI

    (1990), <B><A HREF="party favors.htm">PARTY FAVORS</A></B> (1987), 
    etc.) Unfortunately, due to lack of money, and therefore time, these 
    weren't nearly as funny as they might have been.</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Terror Universal</B>: 
    Recently, you co-wrote a fiction along with the &quot;great&quot; 
    Charles Napier, with whom you worked in several films. Which was this 
    project's genesis and what's the subject of this book?</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>George Buck Flower</B>: 
    Charles Napier, one of my best friends and favorite character actors, 
    and I originally wrote <B>RED NECKS IN LOVE</B> as a screenplay over 
    twenty-five years ago. During that time period, options to make the 
    material into a movie were purchased four different times by four 
    different individuals. Unfortunately, each time sufficiant money had 
    been raised to convert the script to the screen, somebody would 
    declare the material to be too 'Chauvinistic'. When this happened,the 
    financers (Even though each time they were totally different 
    entities,) would get cold feet. The option was then dropped, with the 
    rights reverting back to Charlie and I who would sell them again, 
    only to be accused of female bashing once more. It was almost 
    comical, except for the sad fact that the story does not paint women 
    in a bad light. Except for two women and an alcoholic pig, all 
    characters within the piece are caught up in the muck and mire of 
    North American society's dictates of corruption and stupidity. Those 
    who reside in the rural areas are simply more honest about being 
    crooked and stupid. Two of our 'heros' are indeed always running 
    around the countryside in a beat up old motor home with thier drunken 
    pet pig, trying to have sex with older and overweight ladies. God 
    knows, you can't a story with any realism about American Red Necks 
    without making them womanizers.</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco">Years later, after deciding to 
    expand this whacky satire of human behavior into a novel, we got 
    lucky. We found somebody that actually willing to pay us and publish 
    it. Now, because the story was made into a novel, a fifth option to 
    make it into a movie has once again been purchased. The screen rights 
    to <B>RED NECKS IN LOVE</B> are now temporarily the property of a 
    wonderful actor/musician named Demitri Diatchevica. Quite by 
    coincincidence, Demitri has also just finished a Latin C. D., 
    entitled Passion, Fire and Romance. Currently on the market, with two 
    of its instrumentals happening to be Argentinean, this music can be 
    obtained over the Internet by contacting dimitrid.com. Good luck on 
    all fronts Demitri!!</FONT><BR>

    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>Terror Universal</B>: Which 
    player or director (alive or dead) would you have liked to work with, 
    and you weren't able to do it up to now? Which are your best friends 
    of the industry?</FONT><BR>
    <BR>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><B>George Buck Flower</B>: I wish 
    to work for any director willing to hire me. As for actors with whom 
    I haven't had the pleasure of working, but wish I could, there are 
    far too many to mention. However, I am a fan of Steve Harris, a 
    member of <B>THE PRACTICE</B> cast. I'd really like to do a scene 
    with that guy some time. I think it would be as much fun as the three 
    pages in a jail cell I got to do with Willie Nelson on a television 
    episode of <B><A HREF="dr_quinn.htm">DR. QUINN, MEDICINE WOMAN</A></B>.
     As for the very dear friends I have made among the actors I have 
    worked with in this business, that list would fill the Pacific Ocean. 
    I'll give it a shot, but I'm bound to leave out far too many. I 
    suppose among the closest are: Jef Richard, John Goff, Stacy Keach, 
    William Sanderson, Don Edmunds, William Smith and , of course, 
    Charles Napier, the brother I never had, but now I do.</FONT><BR>
