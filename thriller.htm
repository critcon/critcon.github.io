    ASSASSIN</A><A NAME="AForAssassin1966"></A> (1966) -</B> Let's 
   travel back to 1966, when the giallo genre was just in its infancy. 
   This &quot;reading of the will&quot; murder mystery contains all of 
   the giallo ingredients: an unknown killer, a large mysterious house, 
   plenty of red herrings and a twisty plot. Yet this film is more like 
   Agatha Christie's &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; than a full blown 
   giallo flick, even though it is based on a novel by Ernesto Gastaldi, 
   who wrote the screenplays to some of the best giallo films,<A HREF="a_for_assassin_1966.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/a for assassin poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="229" HEIGHT="310" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>

   (1971), <B><A HREF="death_walks_at_midnight_1972.htm">DEATH WALKS AT MIDNIGHT</A></B> 
   (1972) and, my favorite, <B><A HREF="#Torso1973">TORSO</A></B> 
   (1973). This film is interesting for that fact alone and also because 
   it contains a cast of actors who would soon become very familiar with 
   the giallo genre, appearing in some of the best of them (at least in 
   my opinion).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film begins with Angela (Mary Arden; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#BloodBlackLace1964">BLOOD
    AND BLACK LACE</A></B> - 1964) finding the dead body of her uncle, 
   rich industrialist John Prescott, in his study, his throat cut with a 
   large knife that has a crude letter &quot;A&quot; carved into the 
   handle. At the reading of his will, we meet the long list of 
   suspects. They are: Angela, who is the daughter of John's brother 
   Paul; Julian Prescott (Charlie Charun) John's retarded son, the 
   &quot;last of the Prescotts&quot;, who is always laughing while 
   whittling away at a piece of wood; Martha Prescott (Giovanna 
   Galletti; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#GirlInRoom2A">THE GIRL IN 
   ROOM 2A</A></B> - 1973), John's sister, who looked after John 
   &quot;like a wife&quot; and took care of Julian; George Prescott 
   (Ivano Staccioli as &quot;John Heston&quot;; <B><A HREF="#Devil7Faces1971">THE
    DEVIL WITH SEVEN FACES</A></B> - 1971), John's nephew, and his 
   cheating wife, Adriana (A&iuml;ch&eacute; Nana); Giacomo (Sergio 
   Ciani as &quot;Alan Steel&quot;; <B><A HREF="hercules_against_the_moon_men_1964.htm">HERCULES
    AGAINST THE MOON MEN</A></B> - 1964), John's &quot;trusted&quot; 
   secretary; and Armando (Ivano Davoli; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SevenBloodOrchids72">SEVEN
    BLOOD-STAINED ORCHIDS</A></B> - 1972), a &quot;distant 
   relative&quot;. Also at the reading of the will (but not mentioned in 
   it) are police Inspector Matt (Gilberto Mazzi as &quot;Gilbert 
   Mash&quot;); police Sgt. Robson (Roland Redman); John's maid, Mary 
   (Giovanna Lenzi as &quot;Barbara Penn&quot;; <B><A HREF="#CrimesBlackCat">CRIMES
    OF THE BLACK CAT</A></B> - 1972); and Peter (Franco Pesce as 
   &quot;Frank Fisher&quot;; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Paranoia1969">PARANOIA</A></B> 
   - 1969), the gardener. Everyone thinks that they alone will inherit 
   John's fortune, but there's a potential roadblock: The will is a 
   voice recording by John, who stipulates that only three people (each 
   getting an equal share) will inherit his fortune and they all must 
   work together to decide which three get it. If more than three people 
   arrive at executor (and notary) Jackson's (Aldo Rendine; <B><A HREF="street_people_1976.htm">STREET
    PEOPLE</A></B> - 1976) office at the appointed time, no one will 
   inherit anything. Oh, and one more thing: Everyone must live together 
   in his mansion (the same place he was murdered) for one month, after 
   which time the three people will go to Jackson's office (In his voice 
   recording, John manages to put everyone down in a backhanded way, 
   proving that he was a bastard when he was alive.).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Inspector Matt wants Jackson to make a copy of the voice recording 
   for his office, because he rightfully believes that this situation 
   will lead to nothing but trouble (He and Sgt. Robson were at the 
   reading of the will believing that one of his relatives murdered 
   John, but they all hated his guts). Almost immediately, the relatives 
   begin turning on each other, Angela revealing to everyone that 
   Adrianna was once a stripper and Julian laughing and repeating what 
   everyone just said. We also find out from Martha that John was 
   &quot;ashamed&quot; of Julian because he is retarded. Later on, the 
   Inspector makes an appearance at the mansion and not-so-subtly 
   accuses accuses one of them of cutting John's throat, also mentioning 
   that the bladed weapon that killed John has not been found (That 
   can't be good!). The relatives, one by one, tell the Inspector that 
   they couldn't have possibly killed John, each one of them explaining 
   their alibi, in detail, at the time of John's murder, but which one 
   is lying? It's hard to tell, each one of them looking guilty as hell 
   (Hey, I'm a poet!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Armando, who is in love with Angela, finds the murder weapon and 
   Angela tells him that Julian probably stole it from the body of John 
   (he's always stealing things), but Julian's too much of an 
   &quot;idiot&quot; to have killed anyone. Armando wants to leave the 
   mansion with Angela because he doesn't care about the money, but 
   Angela says no, dollar signs in her eyes. One-by-one, the relatives 
   sneak off to talk to the Inspector, trying to break the other's 
   alibis. George says that Giacomo was lying about his alibi, since he 
   went to get Adriana a glass of water and saw Giacomo leaving John's 
   study. The Inspector then tells George that Adriana must be lying 
   about her alibi, since he wasn't with her like she said when John was 
   murdered. George, who is now angry, tells the Inspector he hated 
   John, because he would call him to the mansion at all hours of the night<A HREF="a_for_assassin_1966.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/a for assassin book cover2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   and day, so he could have an affair with Adriana. We then discover 
   that Adriana is having an affair with...Giacomo and both of them are 
   planting evidence to make it look like George is the killer. The more 
   we find out about the Prescott family, the more we want to see them 
   suffer.&nbsp; Even John is (and was) a scumbag of the first degree 
   for, even in death, he is able to coax the worst from his relatives 
   and trusted employees.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That's what makes this obscure black &amp; white film so fun. Not 
   one person here, not even Julian or the Inspector, is a likable 
   character. Not only do members of the family wish each other dead, we 
   do, too. We discover that George and Giacomo are actually working 
   together to kill Adriana,&nbsp; so that the money-hungry bitch 
   doesn't get the chance to sleep with another relative and make them 
   agree to split the fortune with her. When Adriana is in bed making 
   love to Giacomo, George enters the bedroom and shoots her in the 
   back, emptying every bullet into her.&nbsp; George and Giacomo put 
   her body in the trunk of a car and George drives off to dispose of 
   her body, but he is killed when somebody forces his car off the road, 
   the car going over a cliff and exploding. I'll give you one guess 
   who's responsible (and it's not who you think).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Director Angelo Dorigo, who uses the pseudonym &quot;Ray 
   Morrison&quot; (<B><A HREF="killer_without_a_face_1968.htm">THE 
   KILLER WITHOUT A FACE</A></B> - 1968), keeps things moving at a brisk 
   pace and the screenplay, by Roberto Natale (<B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#BloodyPitHorror1965">BLOODY
    PIT OF HORROR</A></B> - 1965; <B><A HREF="#WatchMeKill1977">WATCH ME

    BUDDIES</A></B> - 1975), contains so many double and triple-crosses, 
   your head will be spinning, but everything is nicely (if not 
   ironically) resolved in the twisty finale. Since this is a 1966 
   production, there is no nudity or graphic violence, but this film 
   doesn't need either. It's the story that matters here and I'm happy 
   to say it doesn't disappoint. It is well acted, superbly photographed 
   (by Aldo Tonti; <B><A HREF="valachi_papers_1972.htm">THE VALACHI PAPERS</A></B> 
   - 1972) and the music score (by Aldo Piga; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#VampireBallerina60">THE
    VAMPIRE AND THE BALLERINA</A></B> - 1960) is appropriately creepy. 
   The film looks and feels like a modern-day Gothic horror flick, 
   thanks to the huge mansion, shadows around every corner and the 
   haunting, thick atmosphere. This tidy little film (it runs only 76 
   minutes) is must viewing for both giallo fans or people looking for 
   something obscure. It was never available theatrically, on VHS or on 
   disc in the United States. Hell, it's not even available 
   English-dubbed. If you want to see this for free, you'll have to be 
   an Amazon Prime member, as they show a nice anamorphic widescreen 
   streaming version with English subtitles. Just another reason why I 
   am glad to be a Prime member. Produced by Walter Brandi, who starred 
   in such film as <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#VampireBallerina60">THE

   It's hidden behind the books. But be careful cause this viper is 
   poisonous and it's going to kill all the other...vipers.&quot;</B> 
   These are the last words spoken by Gabriele, as he dies in his 
   hospital bed. But what do these words mean? Is it a real viper or a 
   metaphor describing something far more deadly?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Dr. Carlo Martora (Helmut Berger; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#SecretDorianGray70">THE
    SECRET OF DORIAN GRAY</A></B> - 1970) comes into the room to inform 
   Annabella that nothing could be done for Gabriele because he was a 
   habitual drug addict since he was a young boy and this overdose was 
   his last one. We also discover that Gabriele has no family (as least 
   as Dr. Martora knows) and that Annabella was his closest friend. She 
   must now arrange Gabriele's funeral and take care of his legal 
   matters (Annabella is a lawyer), which includes taking care of his 
   personal belongings. She tells Dr. Martora (Who tells her to call him 
   Carlo, so that's what I'll do in this review) that she has defended 
   many drug addicts, but I doubt she has gone through or experienced 
   what is about to transpire. We then discover that Gabriele was 
   convicted of robbery, but due to his condition he was put under house 
   arrest and when his condition worsened, he was confined to a hospital 
   bed. Carlo tells Annabella that he knew Gabriele's mother and she 
   died at the &quot;lowest point of her life.&quot; Carlo also tells 
   her that this is a small town and everyone knows everyone else's 
   business. Annabella tells Carlo that she is thinking about moving 
   herself and her practice to this small and he tells her if she needs 
   any help &quot;adjusting to small town life&quot;, to give him a call 
   and then walks out of the bar they are having a drink in.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Annabella purchases a fully furnished apartment in this small town 
   that belonged to a recently deceased &quot;eccentric&quot;, according 
   to the real estate agent. Only the eccentric the agent was talking 
   about was Gabriele. Yes, this was his apartment and the first thing 
   Annabella does when she is alone is to search behind the books, just 
   as Gabriele told her, only she finds nothing. It seems Annabella has 
   a secret of her own and since she just moved to this small town, the 
   question becomes: Will anyone discover what her secret is? Annabella 
   remembers Gabriele's final words and notices a painting containing 
   books hanging on a wall. There's a secret compartment behind the 
   painting and in it is a round tin containing a bunch of audio 
   cassettes, one of them marked &quot;For Annabella.&quot; She plays 
   the cassette and Gabriele speaks in riddles, saying, <B>&quot;Mother 
   liked Wagner, but her favorite was Puccini. One </B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">d</FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B>ay,
    a man gave her a recording of 'La Boheme'. He was a nice cordial man 
   and it was obvious she liked him a lot. She immediately played the 
   record and began listening to it, like she was in a trance. Suddenly, 
   she raised her eyes. The man had arrived. She seemed happy. That 
   picture filled me with joy. His name was Luce Palmisani. They started 
   seeing each other on a regular basis. He was always bringing her discs.&quot;</B> 
   Are these the ramblings of a drug-addled mind or was Gabriele trying 
   to tell Annabella something important? (Annabella will continue 
   playing portions of the tape during the film and flashbacks will show 
   us the meaning of Gabriele's words.)</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Annabella gets a phone call from Carlo and she wants to know how he 
   knew she was there. &quot;Everybody knows. They're all talking about 
   your arrival&quot; says Carlo. He invites her to come over to his 
   house for a party tonight to meet his many friends and residents who 
   can't wait to meet her. She declines his offer, but Carlo tells her 
   this get-together is in her honor and she can't decline his offer, so 
   she agrees to go to his home at 9:00PM. Once at the party, Carlo 
   introduces Annabella to Mayor Vito Palmisani (Mattia Sbragia; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#DialHelp1988">DIAL:
    HELP</A></B> - 1988) and his wife, Rosa (Annamaria Clementi; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#EmanuelleCannibal77">EMANUELLE
    AND THE LAST CANNIBALS</A></B> - 1977). The Mayor makes it clear 
   that there are no secrets in his town, one of the &quot;disadvantages 
   of small town life.&quot; When Carlo gets Annabella alone, he wants 
   to know why she picked that apartment to live in, because he could 
   have found her a place to live that was much better and cheaper. It 
   is obvious that the entire town wants to know all the dirt on 
   Annabella, but like I said before, she has a secret that will blow 
   the roof off of small town living.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The town's Police Commissioner, Marco Marsili (Carlo Mucari; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#BlackAngel1989">BLACK
    ANGEL</A></B> - 1989), has been receiving a lot of anonymous letters 
   written by the same person (the handwriting looks familiar). One of 
   the letters accuses the Mayor and his wife of accepting kickbacks for 
   the concessions of a building license, so Marco wakes up the Mayor 
   and has him come to the office to read the letter. He denies the 
   accusation and orders Marco to find the person who wrote the letter 
   (The Mayor looks guilty as hell). The writer says that a future 
   letter will have proof of the kickback, which makes the Mayor even 
   angrier (and guiltier looking). So how does all this relate to Annabella?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Mayor goes to Annabella for legal help in this matter, but what 
   he gets instead is Annabella stripping naked and making sweet love to 
   him! (As Annabella is making love to him, she has an image of a 
   scorpion come to her mind every so often, telling us that her sting 
   is deadly). After the lovemaking is over, Annabella agrees to 
   represent him and the Mayor opens up to her about the kickback. 
   Annabella offers a solution to the problem, which the Mayor 
   reluctantly accepts. It then becomes obvious that Annabella's mission 
   is to destroy the reputations and lives of the important people in 
   this small town, using the law and her body to get justice, but 
   justice for what? You will understand once you discover her secret 
   and if you have no plans on seeing this film, go on IMDb and discover 
   it for yourself, as I am not going to reveal it in this review. All I 
   will say is to is re-read Gabriele's final words closely, because 
   they are a thinly-veiled allegory for the brutal truth, as people in 
   town, important people in high standing, begin to commit 
   &quot;suicide&quot; or dying &quot;natural&quot; deaths, beginning 
   with the Mayor and his wife. You may think you know who is 
   responsible, but I am here to tell you that you are wrong.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This is a pretty involving mystery that is somewhat of a giallo 
   film, but missing the black-gloved killer, the POV shots and other 
   things we associate with a giallo flick. What it does have is plenty 
   of nudity, not only by the gorgeous Margie Newton, but also by other 
   females in this small town, including the Mayor's wife. 
   Director/screenwriter Nini Grassia (who directed/wrote over 32 other 
   films, none I ever heard of before, as they are mostly sex comedies 
   or romantic dramas) treats small town living as an Italian version of <B><A HREF="twin_peaks_tv_series.htm">TWIN
    PEAKS</A></B>, as all of the people<A HREF="act_of_revenge_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/act of revenge italy vhs front2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="187" HEIGHT="308" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   who live in this town are not who they seem to be. They may know your 
   business, but they are dangerous, too. No one is to be trusted and 
   Annabella knows it, as she seduces both men and women alike (she has 
   a hot lesbian scene with one of the town's &quot;righteous&quot; 
   female citizens), using them before they use her. This film is also 
   populated by a cast of Italian genre pros, including Helmut Berger (<B><A HREF="#BloodstainButter71">THE
    BLOODSTAINED BUTTERFLY</A></B> - 1971), who has an extended naked 
   lovemaking scene with star Margie Newton<B><A HREF="#Note">*</A></B>,

   will learn in flashbacks. Everyone has his or her moment in this film 
   and no one is wasted. I have been watching a lot of late-'80s Italian 
   genre films lately (<B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#SpiderLabyrinth1988">THE

   they are not as bad as I originally thought they were. Sure, there 
   are some stinkers out there, but not this film, especially when we 
   see Annabella performing oral sex on the elderly Count Leonardi for 
   the sole reason of giving him a fatal heart attack (and she 
   succeeds)! Sleazy? Oh, my, yes! But bad? Not by a long shot. This is 
   a fun film with a corkscrew mystery and good acting, so jump on

   Greta Franklin (the beautiful Barbara Bouchet) arrives at the remote 
   island estate (it's only accessible by boat) of best-selling mystery 
   novelist Richard Stuart (Farley Granger) to work as his secretary. 
   Richard's previous secretary, Sally (Patrizia Viotti), has 
   mysteriously disappeared and we soon find out that Greta and Sally 
   were best friends. Greta has taken the position as Richard's new 
   secretary to investigate her friend's disappearance thanks, in part, 
   to a mysteriously-worded letter that Sally sent her a few days before 
   she vanished. Greta may soon regret her decision, as she is spied on 
   by hulking retarded fisherman Rocco (Petar Martinovitch), who is 
   described as having &quot;the body of a giant and the brain of a 
   child&quot;. Greta is drugged one night and has a steamy, slow-motion 
   lesbian encounter with Richard's lonely wife, Elena (Rosalba Neri), 
   who says to Greta, &quot;I so desperately need a friend!&quot; Greta 
   wakes up one night and finds Richard and Elenora throwing a sex 
   party. Elenora convinces Greta to join in the party (after again 
   drugging her drink) and Elenora shows a porn film that's a take-off 
   of Little Red Riding Hood, where Greta recognizes one of the stars of 
   the film as none other than Sally (Greta, who is confused about <A HREF="amuck_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/amuck dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="174" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Elenora,
    asks Richard about his wife and he replies, &quot;That lady's a 
   mystery I'd rather not solve.&quot;). The next day, Richard pitches a 
   story idea to Greta that sounds too much like her undercover mission 
   to be a coincidence. Greta begins snooping around the mansion and 
   finds some of Sally's personal items half burned-up in the basement 
   furnace. This triggers a flashback that shows Greta and Sally weren't 
   just friends, they were also lovers. After almost getting caught by 
   the Stuart's sinister butler (Umberto Raho) in the basement, Greta 
   gets locked-in, but she manages to escape though a locked grate. The 
   broken grate is noticed by Richard and soon Greta is held prisoner at 
   the estate, the phone lines dead and the boat missing from the dock. 
   Greta then listens to a tape that Richard dictated to her that 
   suspiciously sounds like an admission to killing Sally, although 
   Richard dictates it like it's a new story idea. Is Richard actually 
   responsible for Sally's death or is someone setting him up? If that 
   is the case, what is to become of Greta? You'll have to watch the 
   film to find out.&nbsp; This early 70's Italian mystery (I don't want 
   to call it a giallo, since it doesn't follow standard giallo 
   conventions, such as an unseen gloved killer and brutal murders every 
   few minutes, something this film lacks), directed/scripted by Silvio

   running time, but that's not a bad thing in this film's case. Since 
   we are never sure a crime has been committed, we, along with Greta, 
   are forced to pick up clues along the way. That makes paying 
   attention mighty important for the viewer and it's not until we get 
   two-thirds through the film, when Greta goes duck hunting with 
   Richard, Elenora and Sandro (Dino Mele), that we know that something 
   really is amiss. I don't want to spoil it for first-time viewers 
   other than to say it involves an inoperable shotgun and a tense dip 
   in a pit of quicksand. Farley Granger (<B><A HREF="#Slasher1972">THE SLASHER</A></B>

   cat-and-mouse with Greta, but the film definately belongs to the two 
   female leads, Barbara Bouchet (<B><A HREF="#CryOfAProstitute">CRY OF

    IN ROOM 2A</A></B> - 1973). Not only do they get to act here (the 
   sight of both women with shotguns in their hands excited me somehow), 
   but they both strip naked on several occasions, so what's not to 
   like? While there's not much in the blood and violence departments 
   (besides the on-screen filleting of a live eel), the plentiful nudity 
   and the unwinding mystery are sure to keep your eyes and brain 
   occupied. Give it a try. Also starring Nino Segurini as the police 
   inspector. A Eurovista Digital Entertainment DVD Release. The 
   legality of this fullscreen DVD is questionable, as it is full of 
   emulsion scratches, print damage, the final reel has a horizontal 
   line running through it (making me believe this was taken from a VHS 
   master) and is missing most of the opening credits. The DVD also 
   contains short videotaped interviews with both Bouchet and Neri (who

    JOE BASS</A><A NAME="AngryJoeBass"></A> (1976) -</FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"> 
   Indian fisherman Joe Bass (Henry Bal) makes life difficult for 
   crooked banker George Hanson (Mike Miller), who is foreclosing the 
   loans on all the local fishermen and illegally buying their boats in 
   hopes of taking advantage of new DNR regulations, in this regional 
   Minnesota-lensed riff on <B><A HREF="billy_jack_1971.htm">BILLY JACK</A></B> 
   (1971). The whole film is told in flashback, as Hanson's daughter, 
   Karen (Molly Mershon), is in the hospital suffering from a nervous 
   breakdown after her father has been murdered. She tells the story of 
   how it happened (but can't remember how it ended), which makes up the 
   bulk of the film. Karen meets Joe at a boat auction and strikes up a 
   friendship and, later, a love affair with Joe, which severely pisses 
   off her father (&quot;I told you to stay away from that 
   Indian!&quot;). Karen tries her damnedest to have her<A HREF="angry_joe_bass_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/angry joe bass vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   father and Joe get along, but it falls on deaf ears from both sides 
   (Her mother says to her, &quot;What man would want you when that 
   Indian is done with you?&quot;). Joe goes through a series of bloody 
   beatings and arrests by the crooked sheriff (who does whatever Mr. 
   Hanson orders him to do), but Karen always stays by Joe's side, which 
   just makes her daddy madder. When a bunch of Hanson's goons shoot up 
   Joe's house and injure his father, he says enough's enough. Joe goes 
   after the men who shot up his house and the men end up seriously hurt 
   (one of the guys accidentally cuts off his own leg with a chainsaw!). 
   Under Mr. Hanson's orders, the sheriff sets out to kill Joe. The 
   sheriff sets up a chain of events where he kills two birds with one 
   stone, since he found out his wife is being unfaithful. Both Mr. 
   Hanson and the sheriff's wife end up shot dead in separate incidents 
   as Karen's doctors try to figure out exactly what happened. Karen's 
   flashbacks eventually reveal what actually transpired. Sorry to say 
   that Karen ends up being the total loser here, as her memory reveals 
   that Joe is innocent, but he does not survive to bask in the glory. 
   Joe should have learned not to fuck with the police.&nbsp; This 
   little-seen revenge flick suffers from one real drawback: Henry Bal, 
   who plays Joe Bass, is so fucking ugly (he has a face only a 
   disfigured bulldog could love) and stiff as an actor, it's really 
   hard to root for him. His rants against the DNR (Department of 
   Natural Resources) is never fully explained (the DNR regulates 
   hunting and fishing to manage the state's natural resources), which 
   also hurts the film for people who have no idea what the DNR is (my 
   wife thought is stood for &quot;Do Not Resusitate&quot;!). The 
   flashback scenario is very fragmented and disconcerting. Just when 
   the film gets interesting (Joe's house being shot up), the films 
   stops dead in it's tracks, switches gears and then tells the story of 
   Sheriff Bill Hemmings (Rudy Hornish), whose wife is having an affair 
   with George Hanson, and how Joe caught him trying to rape a young 
   girl in the woods. The latter half of the film plays like a low-rent 
   version of <B><A HREF="rashomon_1951.htm">RASHOMON</A></B> (1951), as 
   two doctors try to figure out just how Mr. Hanson and the sheriff's 
   wife died. The truth lies in a neon-colored recurring nightmare that 
   Karen is having since the murders. The answer is not that surprising. 
   The action and fighting scenes are awkwardly-staged and the whole 
   film looks like it was edited with a butterkinfe. There is some blood 
   and gore on view, but it, too, is badly filmed and much too quick.

    The film concerns the trials and trevails of poor &quot;nobody&quot; 
   Marcos (Vicente Parra), who works at the town's slaughterhouse (Be 
   warned: They show steer being killed, which will put you off Big Macs 
   for good!). The slaughterhouse is the only game in town and Marcos 
   learns from the slaughterhouse owner that his new boss will be a 
   machine (He gives Marcos a long, delirious speech where the word 
   &quot;synchronicity&quot; is repeated several times.). Marcos can do 
   nothing but accept his new position since there are no other jobs to 
   be found. Marcos lives in a hovel of a shack, where well-to-do 
   neighbor Nestor (Eusebio Poncela) spies on him with binoculars from 
   his 13th floor apartment in a new luxurious highrise building just 
   across the tracks from Marcos' flat. (We first see Nestor spying on 
   Marcos through a roof window of his flat, where Marcos is 
   masturbating while looking at magazine photos of scantily-clad women 
   he has taped to his wall).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Marcos and girlfriend Paula (Emma Cohen; <B><A HREF="night_of_the_walking_dead_1975.htm">NIGHT
    OF THE WALKING DEAD</A></B> - 1975) decide to have a romantic night 
   on the town. They hail a taxi and begin making out in the back seat. 
   The disgusted cab driver pulls over and tells them to get out (he 
   doesn't want his taxi to smell like sex!) and when Marcos refuses to 
   pay him, he gets out of the car and knees Marcos in the balls. Paula 
   jumps on the cab driver's back and when it looks like he is about to 
   punch her lights out, Marcos smashes him in the head with a rock and 
   they both flee the scene. The next day, Marcos learns that he killed 
   the cab driver and Paula wants him to go to the police to explain 
   what happened. Marcos refuses, telling Paula that the police won't 
   believe a poor &quot;nobody like him (&quot;The police will listen to 
   the rich only!&quot;). After a night of making love, Paula tells him 
   that she is going to the police because her conscience bothers her, 
   so Marcos has no other choice (at least in his mind) but to kill her 
   (He strangles her with his bare hands while giving her a long, 
   passionate kiss). There's no turning back now.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Marcos' roommate (and older brother) Steve (Charly Bravo; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Monster Dog">MONSTER
    DOG</A></B> - 1985) comes home a day early and Marcos shows him 
   Paula's dead body (Steve amazingly says, &quot;Marriage would have 
   been a better idea!&quot;). Steve insists that Marcos goes to the 
   police (uh oh!), so he splits Steve's skull open with a wrench (One 
   of many tools of the trade that Marcos has hanging on a wall next to 
   his bedroom. Tools that will become handy as the film progresses.).

    Steve's fiancee Carmen (Lola Herrera; a famous Spanish TV star) 
   arrives at Marcos' shack and refuses to leave until she speaks to 
   Steve. Carmen sneaks into Steve's bedroom (after Marcos warns her not 
   to go in there) and sees Steve's corpse. Marcos catches her and she 
   is on a receiving end of a knife to the neck (we watch as Marcos 
   slices her throat). He puts her bloody body on the bed with Steve 
   (Marcos spends some time posing their bodies until he is satisfied!). 
   The bodies are beginning to pile up.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Nestor pays Marcos a late night visit and insists they go for a 
   walk. Nestor drops some clues that he is watching him, but it is 
   obvious that Nestor is gay and wants Marcos as a boyfriend. They stop 
   at an outdoor cafe for a drink when the police pull up and asks them 
   to show their identification cards. Marcos show them his but Nestor 
   didn't bring his with him. He is almost arrested until the cafe owner 
   tells the police that he lives in the expensive new highrise 
   apartment complex. In this town, money talks, so the police give 
   Nestor a gentle reminder that he should carry identification on him 
   at all times.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    OF THE MUMMY</A></B> - 1975) is the next person to pay Marcos a 
   visit. He insists on coming inside, finds Carmen's purse (Very 
   sloppy, Marcos!) and breaks down Steve's bedroom door. He finds 
   Carmen's bloody body and, in the film's most notorious moment, Marcos 
   plants a meat cleaver into his face. Marcos now has a serious 
   problem: His shack is beginning to stink of death, thanks to the 
   decomposing bodies (Wild dogs are scratching at his front door!). He 
   goes to a local drug store and buys ten bottles of mens cologne, 
   which he sprays all over his home, but it is not doing the trick. 
   Marcos gets the bright idea of bringing body parts to work. His new 
   &quot;boss&quot;, a machine that takes scraps of unused beef and 
   grinds it into chuck, which is used for pet food and meat in poor 
   neighborhoods, turns out to be an answer to Marcos' problem. 
   Unfortunately, he can only bring small amounts of body parts with him 
   (which he keeps in a duffel bag) without bringing suspicion on him 
   (He almost gets caught when some neighborhood thugs play a game of 
   &quot;keepaway&quot; with the duffel bag).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Meanwhile, Nestor keeps on showing up at the most inopportune times 
   in Marcos' life. Is Nestor gay and hitting on Marcos or does he know 
   the truth (or both?)? Rosa (Vicky Lagos), a waitress at a local 
   bar/restaurant called Bar Rosa, pays Marcos a visit (&quot;What 
   smells in here?&quot;). She has the hots for Marcos and they have sex 
   on the couch. She insists on cleaning up the bedroom to get rid of 
   the smell (so they can have sex on a bed), but she grows suspicious 
   of Marcos the more he refuses to let her go in there (Marcos is not a 
   good housekeeper, as he leaves his bloody murder tools lying around 
   the shack.). Marcos notices her suspicions and kills her by 
   repeatedly smashing her head against the wall.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Marcos also now has another very serious problem: People and animals 
   are beginning to get severely ill after consuming the tainted meat 
   that came out of his &quot;boss&quot;. Will he be able to solve this 
   problem and get away with multiple murders? The answer comes when 
   Nestor invites him to come to his expensive apartment. Nestor 
   confesses that he knows everything about the murders and shows Marcos 
   how easy it was to spy on him. Nestor really doesn't care because all 
   he wants to do is become Marcos' lover. Marcos breaks a glass and 
   holds a shard of glass to Nestor's neck, but he can't bring himself 
   to kill him. Instead, he leaves the apartment and calls the police, 
   confessing to all the murders. The film ends with Marcos waiting for 
   the police to arrive, as the camera pans across what is rich and what 
   is poor: the stark contrast of the glorious apartment building with 
   Marcos' ramshackle shack, which are only a couple of hundred yards apart.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   constitutes being poor and being rich. Each chapter of his life in 
   this Spanish thriller is broken down to days of the week (shown in 
   Spanish without subtitles). Director Eloy de la Iglesia, who also 
   gave us the entertaining <B><A HREF="clockwork_orange_1971b.htm">A

   sensationalize the murders, rather showing them matter-of-factly, as 
   if Marcos has no other choice given his status in this caste society. 
   The screenplay, by de la Iglesia and Antonio Fos (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#VampiresNightOrgy72">THE
    VAMPIRES NIGHT ORGY</A></B> - 1972). with an assist from

   - 1982; using the pseudonym &quot;Robert Oliver&quot;) for the 
   dialogue in the U.S. theatrical version, is a story about the 
   &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot;, where living in an 
   apartment is a status symbol and living in a shack is akin to being a 
   criminal. There is no overt cannibalism in this film, which is what 
   disappointed me as a teenager when I saw it in a theater. Well, no 
   intentional cannibalism, just a glossed-over moment of a sick dog who 
   ate the meat and a scene where Marcos pukes when he realizes he ate 
   some of that meat at Bar Rosa. There is some bloody violence, but the 
   camera doesn't linger on it. Still, this is an effective film which 
   could have only been made during Spain's Franco regime (Much like <B><A HREF="invasion_of_the_body_snatchers_1956.htm">INVASION

    I don't believe this film was released on VHS in the U.S. in the 
   1980s. The first VHS seems to be the widescreen version that Anchor 
   Bay Entertainment released in 2000, which was also released on DVD at 
   the same time. <A HREF="http://www.blue-underground.com">Blue Underground</A> 
   released it later on DVD (all as <B><A HREF="cannibal_man_1972.htm">CANNIBAL
    MAN</A></B>). The Blu-Ray, from <A HREF="http://codereddvd.bigcartel.com">Code
    Red</A>, is light on extras (just some Code Red trailers), but this 
   is the full, unedited version that was not shown theatrically or on 
   DVD (both cut out the gay subtext). It runs 107 minutes long and the 
   print bears the original Spanish title (<B><A HREF="cannibal_man_spanish_poster_1972.htm">LA
    SEMANA DEL ASENINO</A></B>; &quot;<I>The Week Of The Killer</I>&quot;).
    Some parts are in Spanish with English subtitles, including a scene 
   where a slaughterhouse worker explains to Marcos how his mother died 
   and the unbelievable speech the slaughterhouse owner gives to Marcos. 
   It also restores the gay subtext. The print looks amazingly crisp and 
   clear (you can count the drops of sweat on Marcos' forehead), better 
   than it has ever looked before. If you are the adventurous type, I 
   would recommend you search this Blu-Ray out. Ra&uacute;l Artigot, the 
   director of the Spanish chiller <B><A HREF="witches_mountain_1971.htm">THE

   (2013) -</B> First a word of warning: Even though this film, and many 
   DTV films, are shown on the defunct TV station CHILLER (and sometimes 
   SyFy), it is the worst way to watch these films because all of the 
   nudity and most of the extreme violence is edited out. Buy or rent 
   the DVD or watch it on VOD streaming, because CHILLER cut nearly nine 
   minutes from this film, literally cutting the film's balls off, 
   making it look like some zombie revenge film. That being said, I 
   generally don't care too much for rape/revenge films (But for some 
   reason, women do. I remember showing the uncut VHS version Mier 
   Zarchi's <B><A HREF="i_spit_on_your_grave.htm">I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE</A></B> 
   [1978] on a rainy day down at our our Summer New Jersey Shore house 
   in the mid-90's, expecting the women to be shocked [I was one of the 
   only guys in a house of 8 women. Color me happy! But I was their 
   escorts and designated driver, because there is nothing worse than a 
   woman at a bar at the New Jersey Shore in the Summer. We were all 
   lifelong friends and nothing romantic ever happened. Besides, one of 
   the women is now my ex-wife!]. They were shocked, especially over the 
   two extended rapes [and rightfully so], but they loved the rest of 
   the film. Every time I see them, even up to this day, they ask if I 
   will ever show this film again. Our New Jersey Shore days are long 
   over, but it surprises me that one of the first things they remember 
   and want to relive is that film!). I don't believe forced sex should 
   ever be displayed as entertainment, but this film is more in the vein 
   of the 2010 remake of <B><A HREF="i_spit_on_your_grave_2010.htm">I 
   SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE</A></B> (The over-the-top violence in this version 
   of the film reminded me most of this film), but with a Native 
   American twist and other zombie elements. And it is just<A HREF="avenged_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/avenged 2013 dvd10 front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="218" HEIGHT="319" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   different enough for me to recommend it, mainly because it doesn't 
   wallow in the rape like the 1978 &amp; 2010 films (and also the <A HREF="i_spit_on_your_grave_2_2013.htm">2013
    sequel</A>!). Zoe (Amanda Adrienne, who is absolutely fantastic 
   here) inherits her father's mint 1968 GTO when he passes away. Zoe is 
   a deaf young woman who can talk some English (much in the way Marlee 
   Matlin does) and plans on using the GTO to get out of California and 
   travel to the American Southwest to live with her fiance Dane (Marc 
   Anthony Samuel). Zoe's older sister, Hanna (Sarah J. Stuckey), tries 
   to talk her out of it (I guess the politically correct way is to say 
   &quot;sign&quot; her out of it) by saying the American Southwest is 
   vast and can be dangerous, especially for a young, deaf woman, but 
   Zoe has her mind made up and starts her travels (after taking a 
   selfie of her and her sister with her camera, one of her favorite 
   things to do). Zoe should have listened to her older sister. For the 
   first time in her life, Zoe feels free and drives through national 
   parks and sees other unusual sights, sending texts and photos to 
   Dane, telling him she is on her way. Zoe enters New Mexico (I spent a 
   week there one day) and that's when the trouble starts. She stops to 
   take photos of some very unusual cactus plants and then spots the maggot-ridden
    corpse of a coyote who was definitely killed by human hands with a 
   shotgun, judging by the way its midsection is exposed. Zoe gets back 
   in her GTO and stops at a dumpy little trailer with a sign that says 
   &quot;Hand Made Native Gifts&quot; (the proprietor will become an 
   important character later in the film, but we only get a fleeting 
   glimpse of him in this sequence). Zoe looks at various home made 
   Indian objects (including a tomahawk) and then continues driving (we 
   don't know whether she has purchased anything). She's texting Dane 
   while driving (Doesn't she watch all those anti-texting TV 
   commercials? I'm sure they are Close Captioned.) and nearly hits a 
   Native American in the middle of the road who is seriously injured 
   with a gaping wound in his stomach. Zoe pulls the GTO to the side of 
   the road to go help him, but then she sees a bunch of rednecks 
   chasing another Native American in their truck and run him over. Zoe 
   tries to get the injured Indian into her car and drive away, but the 
   rednecks, which includes Trey (Rodney Rowland; <B><A HREF="soulkeeper_2001.htm">SOULKEEPER</A></B> 
   - 2001); West (Tom Ardavany; <B><A HREF="velocity_trap_1998.htm">VELOCITY
    TRAP</A></B> - 1998); Creed (John Charles Meyer; <B><A HREF="millennium_bug_2011.htm">THE
    MILLENNIUM BUG</A></B> - 2011); Cody (Brionne Davis; <B><A HREF="rest_stop_dont_look_back_2008.htm">REST
    STOP: DON'T LOOK BACK</A></B> - 2008), Trey's brother Jed (Ronnie 
   Gene Blevins; <B><A HREF="blackout_2014.htm">THE BLACKOUT</A></B> - 
   2014) and Trey's slow (i.e. retarded) brother Skeeter (Kyle Morris; <B><A HREF="coffin_baby_2013.htm">COFFIN
    BABY</A></B> - 2013), block her from driving away by putting their 
   truck in front of her GTO. While West stabs the injured Indian over 
   and over with his huge knife in the front seat of the GTO, Zoe tries 
   to run away, only to get shot in the leg by Trey. We then see her 
   tied to a bed with barb wire in the home of Trey's mother (Donell 
   Russell) and she sits outside while the guys take turns raping Zoe, 
   one even making her suck on the barrel of a pistol (It's bad, but not 
   as bad as the films I mentioned above). West says she's a useless 
   deaf mute who is &quot;color blind&quot; (he goes through her purse 
   and finds a photo of her and Dane, who happens to be Black). Speaking 
   about Dane, he becomes increasingly worried when she doesn't show up 
   to their house or send him any more photos or texts on her phone. He 
   looks at the last photo she sent him and in the background there is a 
   sign that reads &quot;Acme, New Mexico&quot;, so he calls the police 
   department there and heads out to Acme to see if he can find her. The 
   guys continue raping Zoe (thankfully, most of it offscreen), but it 
   is the brutal Trey who takes particular delight in raping and 
   torturing her, pouring Jack Daniels on her bullet wound. Trey also 
   has a refrigerator full of old Indian skulls and shows them to Zoe, 
   saying some of them date back to his great-great-grandfather, who was 
   a notorious Indian fighter. His whole family has hated Indians since 
   they have lived in this part of the country, which is at least 200 
   years. He considers them less than human and takes pleasure in 
   hunting them down and killing them. Some of the heads in the 
   refrigerator are kills of his own. West says that Zoe has to be 
   &quot;put down&quot;, because if she lives, she will destroy the 
   whole gang and they will be in prison for life. Trey, who is a 
   natural-born gambler, makes a deal with West: They will play one hand 
   of cards and if Trey wins, he gets to keep Zoe as his plaything. If 
   West wins, they will kill her immediately and she will be &quot;an 
   angel who gets her wings&quot;. Zoe is having flashbacks of Dane 
   proposing to her to get her mind off the pain of her trying to free 
   her arms from the barb wire (it's a really hard scene to watch, as 
   the barb wire slits open her arms from the elbows-down) and she 
   actually gets her arms free, but it is all for naught, since West has 
   won the hand of cards and stabs her over-and-over with his large 
   knife (which is really nothing but an extension of his penis, since 
   we never see him take part in any of the rapes). West buries Zoe in a 
   shallow grave in the desert, where she is found by Native American 
   tracker Grey Wolf (Joseph Runningfox; <B><A HREF="rites_of_passage_2011.htm">RITES
    OF PASSAGE</A></B> - 2011), the proprietor of the dumpy trailer 
   selling home made Native American goods that Zoe stopped at earlier 
   in the film, and he brings her dead body back to his home, where he 
   performs an ancient Indian ritual with her body so she can rest in 
   eternal peace. But something goes horribly wrong when the spirit of 
   an ancient Apache warrior enters her body and he tells Grey Wolf that 
   Trey and his friends will &quot;Now walk...in Hell!&quot; before he 
   knocks-out Grey Wolf. Zoe is now alive, but like all living dead, her 
   body begins to rot the longer she walks the Earth. Dane has now made 
   it to Acme and is spending the night in a motel, where we watch him 
   flip channels using the remote for the TV and see snippets of <B><A HREF="terror_1963.htm">THE
    TERROR</A></B> (1963) and <B><A HREF="streetfighter_1974.htm">THE STREETFIGHTER</A></B> 
   (1974), among other films and TV shows. The clip of <B><A HREF="terror_1963b.htm">THE
    TERROR</A></B> is particularly relevant since it comes at the end of 
   the film, where Jack Nicholson kisses Sandra Knight and she begins to 
   disintegrate in front of his eyes. The possessed Zoe is now able to 
   hear (a telling scene is when a dog barks and she looks its way) and 
   she calls Dane on a payphone one last time to tell him that she loves 
   him (she is not possessed 100% of the time). Dane, in turn, calls the 
   operator to see where the call originated from. Zoe first spots Jed, 
   who happens to be a police officer. She follows him into a bar, where 
   all of the patrons stop what they are doing to look at the 
   deteriorating Zoe, Jed unaware she is behind him. She stabs Jed in 
   the gut with a broken bottle and begins to pull out yards of his 
   intestines while he is still alive. Zoe stops the bartender from 
   shooting her by tossing a chair at him and killing him instead and 
   then shoves a broken pool cue into another guy's eye when he tries to 
   intervene. After pulling out nearly all of Jed's intestines (it's 
   quite graphic), she finishes him off with a broken bottle to his 
   face. Dane gets to the bar an hour late and when he goes to the 
   payphone where Zoe made her call to him, he spots all the rednecks 
   across the street and he asks them if they have seen Zoe (he shows 
   them a photo). Trey's only response is, &quot;Sorry. We don't help 
   niggers.&quot; When Dane mentions that she made a call from the phone 
   across the road an hour earlier, they make West take them to her 
   burial site to make sure she is actually dead. Surprisingly, Sheriff 
   Holt (Daniel Knight) is sympathetic to Dane's plight (in other words, 
   he's a decent human being), but he has trouble believing that a mute 
   girl that probably weighs 110 pounds soaking wet could commit all the 
   bloody carnage in the bar. When Grey Wolf gains consciousness, he 
   sees that Zoe is gone (she is hiding in a farmer's barn, where she 
   sees herself in the mirror and what she is becoming) and he goes 
   looking for her to try and remove the Apache warrior possession.&nbsp;
    Zoe discovers a room in the barn fill of all type of sharp 
   instruments, including a bow and a good supply of arrows. The 
   rednecks make it to Zoe's grave and find it empty, but West swears 
   she was dead and Creed says a pack of coyotes probably dragged her 
   away since her grave was so shallow. A short time later, Skeeter 
   watches from the truck while Zoe shoots an arrow into Creed's leg and 
   then riddles his body with arrows (including one to the crotch. 
   Ouch!). Before Creed dies he manages to shoot Zoe once in the face 
   (We then watch Zoe take her engagement ring off and all of the skin 
   on the finger comes off with it. Yech!). She knows she doesn't have 
   much time left on this Earth when she pulls the bandages off one of 
   her arms (where she ripped it apart with the barb wire on the bed) 
   and discovers the wound is crawling with maggots (a well done, if 
   hard to watch, scene). Zoe goes back to Grey Wolf's trailer and he 
   tells her if she actually wants revenge she better do it fast (There 
   is a ritual Grey Wolf can perform to put Zoe to rest, but Zoe would 
   rather have the revenge, as would anyone with a sense of justice. 
   Since Zoe doesn't feel pain, why not give the people their just 
   desserts?). Sheriff Holt finds Zoe's engagement ring in the barn and 
   begins to think that Zoe is the killer since the barn stinks of 
   death. Zoe leaves one final message on Dane's bathroom mirror that 
   says &quot;Please forgive me&quot; when the room fills up with steam 
   from the hot water, but before he can run outside and catch up with 
   Zoe, the remainder of the rednecks kidnap Dane (In true <B><A HREF="warriors_1979.htm">THE
    WARRIORS</A></B> [1979] fashion, Cody yells out, &quot;Angel, we got 
   your booooy!&quot; over and over, just like the scene with the beer 
   bottles where David Patrick Kelly yells out, &quot;Warriors, come out 
   and plaaay!&quot; in director Walter Hill's classic). Zoe shoots an 
   arrow into Cody's neck (&quot;What is in my neck?&quot;) and a 
   still-alive Cody jumps in the front seat of the truck with West and 
   Dane in the bed of the truck. They can't believe they are seeing Zoe 
   in such a decomposed state and still walking, so they drive off, but 
   a quick running Zoe jumps into the bed of the truck and gets into a 
   fight with West and his big knife, but how can you kill something 
   that is already dead (Dane can't see any of this because he is in a 
   sack)? West stabs her over and over with his knife to no effect, 
   until he accidentally injures Dane in the sack with the knife. Zoe 
   has had enough and rams West's head through the back window of the 
   truck. She goes to stab West with his own knife, but a quick-thinking 
   Trey slams on the brakes and Zoe goes flying over the front of the 
   truck (it is well executed). Trey runs her body over with the truck, 
   but when she gets up and screams, she scares the shit out of the 
   rednecks and they drive away, still with Dane as a hostage. We are 
   now in a warehouse, where Dane is tied to a chair and Trey's father 
   (Peter Sherayko) and several survivalists (who have sold some 
   automatic weapons to the rednecks) are waiting for Zoe to arrive. We 
   watch Zoe patch her body up with plenty of duct tape (Is there 
   nothing this product can't do?), while Cody still complains about the 
   arrow in his neck (if they pull it out, he will surely bleed to 
   death. The ancient Apache warrior leaves Zoe's body and gives her an 
   ancient knife, tomahawk and a magical necklace (A mixture of CGI and 
   practical effects and, I have to say, it wasn't half bad). The 
   dastardly Trey tells Dane how they all took turns to rape his fiancee 
   and West then killed her (he still doesn't believe that Zoe is dead). 
   Sheriff Holt talks to Skeeter and he does the right thing and tells 
   the Sheriff the whole sordid story (Skeeter never raped Zoe, but Trey 
   and Jed were still his brothers). Cody is tired of waiting around 
   with an arrow in his neck, so he steals a car and goes to drive to 
   the hospital, but Zoe appears and throws a spear, whose tip is the 
   ancient knife, right into Cody's head and the car goes flying over 
   her body (a great stunt comprised of CGI and real action). Zoe begins 
   to systematically kill the survivalists and rednecks, using her 
   new-found supernatural powers until only West and Trey are left. Zoe 
   throws the tomahawk into West's chest and drags his body away while 
   he is screaming. Trey finds West without a heart (Did he really have 
   one?), as he sees Zoe eating it. Sheriff Holt shows up and Trey 
   shoots him in the neck, but doesn't kill him. Dane finally realized 
   that Zoe is dead because he sees her reflection in a window as she 
   stands behind him. She goes to lovingly touch his shoulder, but 
   leaves instead, walking past the still-alive Sheriff Holt (even in 
   his state, he can't believe what he is seeing). Trey drives to Grey 
   Wolf's trailer and wants to know if there is a way to stop this 
   carnage, but Grey <A HREF="savaged_2013.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/savaged aka avenged australia dvd8 front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="228" HEIGHT="321" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Wolf
    tells him the curse will only be finished when Trey is dead. Zoe 
   visits Trey's mother and plants the tomahawk in her head. A 
   guilt-ridden Skeeter has already killed himself by slitting his 
   wrists with a box cutter. Zoe shows up at Grey Wolf's trailer and Zoe 
   and Trey get into a chainsaw/tomahawk fight. Zoe cuts off one of 
   Trey's hands and then hits him in the crotch with the tomahawk 
   (Double ouch!!). While he is on his knees, Trey uses his only good 
   hand and runs the chainsaw through Zoe's torso, but it has little 
   effect on Zoe and she cuts Trey's head off with the tomahawk (I 
   wonder if his skull will end up in that refrigerator?). When Dane 
   shows up at Grey Wolf's place, he sees Trey's headless body and Zoes 
   trying to bury herself (just like in the finale of director Bob 
   Clark's <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Deathdream">DEATHDREAM</A></B> 
   [1972], which this film shares many of the same qualities, which is 
   not a bad thing at all). Dane lovingly rubs her cheek, pours gasoline 
   on her and, before he lights the match, Zoe signs &quot;I Love 
   You&quot;. Dane lights the gasoline and his love burns to death.

   TV re-enactment series and short films between these two films) fills 
   this film with many references to other films (It's a great film just 
   for that fact alone. See how many tributes you can spot in this 
   film.), but it is a great revenge film in it's own right, filled with 
   many memorable sequences, some wonderful dialogue and good acting. 
   The only thing that bothers me is that in films of this type, there 
   always has to be a mentally handicapped person who wants nothing to 
   do with violence but always is forced to get involved, but unlike 
   most other films, that character kills himself here because of the 
   guilt. In the end, he really is the only redneck with a conscience. 
   The violence may seem a little too much from time to time, but when 
   is violence not? Thankfully, Ojeda keeps the rape scenes to a minimum 
   and focuses on the revenge and what it means to know you are dead, 
   still love someone, but know there is only one way out. That's the 
   underlining driving factor behind this film. Love is a powerful 
   thing, but there are also more powerful things out there that trump 
   it, like revenge. And this film dishes it out in spades. Both the 
   physical effects (including Zoe's decomposing body and the arrow 
   stuck in Cody's neck) and most of the digital effects are excellent 
   (even the digital effect of the Apache warrior coming out of Zoe's 
   body is done well) and there's a lot more to recommend here (such as 
   the Sheriff not being one of the &quot;good old boys&quot; and 
   actually taking Dane seriously), so my advice is to buy this one and 
   skip the version shown on CHILLER. That version is just a ghost shell 
   of the full version. My highest recommendation. Made in 2013, but not 
   released on DVD in the U.S. until 2015. Also starring Ed Fletcher, 
   Jason Gurwitz, Dan Kiefer, Bobby Field, Ernie Charles and Rick Mora 
   as the injured Indian Zoe nearly hits with her car. An <A HREF="http://www.uncorkedentertainment.com">Uncork'd

   people. In Bogota, Columbia, The Belko Corporation, a non-profit 
   organization with buildings in 40 countries, is supposedly 
   responsible for supplying employees to American countries overseas, 
   which would explain why most of the people in this building speak 
   English and are American (one employee says, &quot;Normal people do 
   not work at Belko.&quot;). What is strange is their location; the 
   buliding seems purposely to be someplace out of the way and very 
   modern. Also unusual is that Belko has implanted &quot;tracking 
   chips&quot; in the back of every employees head, saying that is is 
   merely a precaution in case anyone is kidnapped in Colombia, which is 
   a common thing. One day, Belko employee Mike Milch (John Gallagher 
   Jr.) wonders why every vehicle is being searched by an armed militia 
   as they enter the Belko parking lot. Usually there is just a guard, 
   Evan (James Earl), at the entrance. But this is no regular day at 
   Belko, as when all 80 employees are in the building, all the windows 
   and doors are covered by thick metal sheets, which drop from hidden 
   openings. With no way to leave the building (The thick metal doesn't 
   even get hot when maintenance man Bud [Michael Rooker, a Gunn 
   favorite who has appeared in all of his films and made his bones 
   playing <B><A HREF="henry_portrait_of_a_serial_killer.htm">HENRY: 
   PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER</A></B> - 1986] uses an acetylene welding 
   torch to try and cut a hole in the metal, with no success), a voice 
   comes over the loud speaker that says the employees must murder any 
   two people in the building in 30 minutes or else four will die (Phase 
   1). Thinking it is a joke, the employees think that someone must have 
   hacked into the building and made the metal barricades drop, but when 
   two people aren't killed within 30 minutes, the &quot;tracking 
   implants&quot; explode and take out the back of the heads of four 
   employees. These implants weren't for tracking at all, they are small 
   bombs (All done very well and bloody as hell). Mike tries to remove 
   his implant with a boxcutter (very bloody), but the voice comes on 
   and warns Mike to stop or else his implant will be detonated. The 
   employees find hidden tiny cameras and bugs throughout the building 
   and know that everyone's movements are being monitored. The voice 
   comes back on and warns the employees to stop searching and ripping 
   out the cameras or more people will die. Knowing that this is no 
   joke, Belko boss and former Special Ops soldier Barry Morse (an 
   excellent Tony Goldwyn; <B><A HREF="ghost_1990.htm">GHOST</A></B> - 
   1990) gets power-hungry and he goes to Evan and demands the keys to 
   the room that holds weapons. Evan says no, so Barry joins forces with 
   employees Wendell Dukes (an equally excellent John C. McGinley; IFC's <B><A HREF="stan_against_evil_tv_series_2016.htm">STAN
    AGAINST EVIL</A></B> [2016 - 2018]), who continuously shows improper 
   sexual advances to Mike's girlfriend and Belko employee Leandra 
   (Adria Arjona) and an extremely nervous Terry (Owain Yeoman; <B><A HREF="mentalist_tv_series.htm">THE
    MENTALIST</A></B> - 2008-2015), grab the welding torch and begin 
   cutting into the metal door that holds the weapons. The voice come 
   back on and tells everyone that they must murder 30 people in two 
   hours or else 60 people will die by having the back of their heads 
   blown off (Phase 2). This is when things turn very ugly. Wendell 
   stabs Evan in the stomach with a large knife and kills him, taking 
   the keys after Mike disables the welding torch. Now the deadly trio 
   have guns and Barry orders everyone to go to the lobby. (Maintenance 
   man Bud already has his head bashed in with a hammer by his assistant 
   Lonny (David Dastmalchian) and then he goes after brand new employee 
   Dany (Melonie Diaz), who kicks him away and is impaled in the head by 
   metal nails sticking out of the wall (You can actually see the dent 
   in Bud's head and Rooker's reaction to the deadly blow is priceless). 
   Barry picks out 30 people he is going to kill (&quot;Who in the lobby 
   is over 60?&quot;) and has them get on their knees and begins 
   shooting them in the head. He also picks Mike to be murdered because 
   of what he did to the welding torch. Just as Mike is going to be 
   murdered by Barry, Dany goes to the electrical panel and turns off 
   the electricity, turning the lobby into pitch-black darkness. Mike 
   and the rest of the people who were chosen to be killed escape, so 
   Barry, Wendell and Terry begin to kill anyone they see with guns, a 
   meatcleaver and anything else they can get their hand on. In the 
   film's most chilling scene, the voice come back on the loud speaker 
   and tell everyone the two hours are up and that 29 people were 
   killed, so, since they haven't reached the intended goal of 30 
   murders, a total of 60 people will be killed. Stoner employee Marty 
   (Sean Gunn, the brother of James Gunn), who believes the water has 
   been spiked with drugs (he's paranoid from smoking too much pot). 
   watches the employees hiding under the cafeteria tables have the back 
   of their heads explode (The film's most effective scene). After 60 
   employees are killed, (Marty digs out the implants on the people 
   Barry murdered and puts them in a linen napkin, which Mike takes), 
   the voice comes back on and says that the person that kills the most 
   people will be spared (Phase 3). Barry has more kills than anyone 
   else and the&nbsp; 16 employees that are left begin to turn feral, 
   even Mike (who was a pacifist throughout this whole experience), who 
   sees his girlfriend Leandra murdered by Barry. Mike kills Barry by 
   bashing his head over and over in with a tape dispenser (earlier, 
   Leandra murders Wendell by hacking his head in with an axe until his 
   face is nothing but a bloody pulp. It is easy to spot that this scene 
   was edited in order to get an R-rating, but if you pause at a certain 
   time, you can see one frame of the resulting carnage to Wendell's 
   head. That'll teach him for his unwanted sexual advances towards 
   her!). Mike ends up the winner by being the last person left alive, 
   so two heavily armed military men take him outside and lead in to a 
   metal shed where &quot;The Voice&quot; (Gregg Henry, another one of 
   Gunn's repertoire actors) tells Mike that this was a social 
   experiment to prove that even the most honest and gentle of people 
   can turn into cold-blooded murderers with the right circumstances put 
   into place. Mike notices a board with all the employees names on it 
   with a switch next to their names. It is the trigger that explodes 
   the implants. Mike lunges at The Voice (his face is burned on one 
   side, but no reason is given why. Could he also have participated in 
   this experiment in the past? In this film, employee Vince [Brent 
   Sexton, a frequent guest star on many TV series. He had a regular 
   role in one season of <B><A HREF="killing_tv_series_2011.htm">THE KILLING</A></B> 
   from 2011 to 2012] makes some molitov cocktails and burns a few 
   people to death during Phase 3.), but the military men pull Mike off 
   of him. Mike asks if The Voice knows what happened to all the 
   implants that Marty dug out of the heads that Barry murdered and The 
   Voice looks surprised. Turns out that Mike placed them on the 
   military men that manhandled him to the shed and when he lunged at 
   The Voice he also put one on his person. He then lunges at the board 
   and flicks every switch except the one with his name on it and kills 
   the military guards and seriously injures The Voice. Mortally 
   wounded, The Voice asks for mercy (but knows he will not get it). 
   Mike finishes him off with a few bullets from an automatic weapon and 
   walks <A HREF="belko_experiment_2017.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/belko experiment 2017 poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="168" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>outside.
    We then see a camera is watching Mike. As the camera pulls back, it 
   shows hundreds of TV monitors watching other people (probably from 
   the other 40 buildings in different countries who are going through 
   the same thing as Mike) and we hear a voice say &quot;Initializing 
   Stage 2&quot;. It looks like Mike is in for another bloody adventure. 
   (My guess is that he will be joining the winners from the other 40 
   buildings and be put through more deadly mental and physical 
   torture.) This film wastes no time getting to the good stuff. We 
   really don't get to know each employee too well, but that is not a 
   problem. We know Wendell is a letch because he is always leering and 
   sending sexual PMs to Leandra's computer, so him being one of the few 
   to be evil from the start comes as no surprise. He enjoys killing 
   people and doesn't try to hide it (at one point in the film , we see 
   him chopping at employees with a meatcleaver). The film is littered 
   with many familiar faces, including </FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Abraham

   2009. Like most BlumHouse productions, this was made for about five 
   million dollars and played widely in theaters, but it bombed, making 
   slightly over ten million dollars in the U.S. from March to May of 
   2017. Even though this has a 2017 copyright, it was actually filmed 
   in 2015 and takes many of its queues from the Japanese film <B><A HREF="battle_royale_2000.htm">BATTLE

    ENDGAME</A></B> (2010), but does it in such a different way, you'll 
   forget the similarities almost immediately. The film is filled with 
   scenes that just bend your mind, such as brand new employee Dany 
   surviving attack after attack. She even manages not to get squashed 
   when she hides on top of an elevator, but her new friend Keith (Josh 
   Brener) isn't so lucky. As Dany is taking the elevator down to the 
   lobby, she is uncerimoniously shot in the head by Barry as soon as 
   ther elevator door opens. It comes so fast, you don't know whether to 
   laugh or cry. One scene I did laugh at, though, was the scene of a 
   dog peeing on the fence that surrounds the Belko building, a perfect 
   metaphor for how the people must feel trapped inside. No one gives a 
   piss about them. The film's 89 minute running time goes by so fast, 
   that you end up wanting more. James Gunn has said he has a good idea 
   where a sequel will go, but since the film bombed (A film has to make 
   triple its budget to be considered successful), I would not look for 
   a sequel any time soon. This is bloody good fun and I highly 
   recommend it. An Orion Pictures <A HREF="belko_experiment_2017b.htm">DVD</A>

    Someone wearing black gloves types a note on a typewriter that 
   reads: <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">&quot;Sandra Roversi. Age 18. Pick up 
   between Mirti St. and Belgrade St. 9pm. Follow to Gardens. Three.&quot;</FONT></B> 
   It looks like a telegram, but could it be instructions for a 
   kidnapping or something much worse? We then see Sandra Roversi 
   (Annamaria Spogli) walking down the street (she stands out from 
   everyone else due to the bright red coat she is wearing) while the 
   unknown person wearing black gloves secretly snaps photos of her. We 
   then see that the gloved killer (I guess we can call this person 
   that, as you will see shortly) has a collection of sharp daggers and 
   knives, which are placed neatly and evenly on a red velvet cloth. The 
   killer picks out a knife and then studies the photos of Sandra, 
   picking out one and writing the number &quot;3&quot; on it with a red 
   marker (I see a theme here!), then covering the knife collection with 
   another piece of red velvet. At a newsstand, the headline of the 
   local Rome newspaper reads &quot;Woman Mysteriously Murdered! Third 
   In Little Over A Month!&quot;, telling us that Sandra Roversi has 
   been killed. We are then introduced to American writer Sam Dalmas 
   (Tony Musante; <B><A HREF="grissom_gang_1971.htm">THE GRISSOM GANG</A></B> 
   - 1971; the short-lived TV Series <B><A HREF="toma_tv_series_1973.htm">TOMA</A></B>

    SECRET OF DORIAN GRAY</A></B> - 1970), a professor at the local 
   university. Sam is not happy with his latest writing assignment, 
   writing manuals on the preservation of rare birds, joking with Carlo 
   and saying it would be funny if he won a prize for doing it. Sam is 
   suffering from a severe case of writers block, telling Carlo that he 
   hasn't been able to write his latest novel for over two years, not 
   even a single sentence. A friend told him to go to Italy, nothing 
   ever happens there, so he'll have all the peace and quiet he needs to 
   write his novel (&quot;May he rot in Hell&quot; says Sam about his 
   friend). The only good thing that has happened to Sam in Italy was 
   meeting model Julia (Suzy Kendall; <B><A HREF="#Torso1973">TORSO</A></B> 
   - 1973), telling Carlo if he didn't set him up with the job of 
   writing bird manuals, he wouldn't have the money to fly Julia back to 
   the States with him the day after tomorrow. What Sam doesn't know is 
   that things, very bad things, are about to happen in Italy and they 
   will change his life forever.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While walking home that night, Sam notices a woman struggling with 
   someone dressed all in black in an art gallery. He almost gets hit by 
   a car, not noticing that the person dressed in black has stabbed the 
   woman and escaped. When Sam goes to help the woman, he becomes 
   trapped in the gallery's entrance when the automatic door closes and 
   locks behind him. All Sam can do is watch helplessly as the woman 
   crawls towards him and then passes out (Without giving too much away, 
   I'll tell you this: Pay close attention to the sculptures in the 
   front of the gallery and try to identify them). Sam gets the 
   attention of a pedestrian, who then calls the police. Inspector 
   Morosini (Enrico Maria Salerno; <B><A HREF="action.htm#ExecutionSquad1972">EXECUTION
    SQUAD</A></B> - 1972) arrives on the scene and questions Sam, 
   telling him that the woman will survive thanks to him. He wants to 
   know everything Sam saw and heard, down to the smallest detail, but 
   before Sam can speak, the owner of the gallery, Alberto Ranieri 
   (Umberto Raho; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EerieMidnight1974">THE 
   EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW</A></B> - 1974), arrives and identifies 
   the woman as his wife, Monica (Eva Renzi; <B><A HREF="death_occurred_last_night_1970.htm">DEATH
    OCCURRED LAST NIGHT</A></B> - 1970). Alberto tells the Inspector 
   that his wife stayed late to go over the books and he came to pick 
   her up. He also asks the Inspector who stabbed Monica and he says he 
   doesn't know, he hopes she will be able to tell him. Monica is then 
   transported to the hospital with Alberto following the ambulance. Sam 
   then tells the Inspector, &quot;There was something wrong with that 
   scene, something odd. I can't pin it down, but I have a definite 
   feeling that something doesn't fit.&quot; The Inspector finds a 
   single black leather glove at the top of the stairs in the gallery 
   that is stained with blood, pulls Sam in for questioning, takes his 
   passport and tells him he is not going anywhere until he comes up 
   with the bit of information that doesn't fit and even goes as far as 
   to accuse Sam of stabbing Monica, telling him that there have been 
   three unsolved murders of young women and for all he knows, Sam could 
   be the killer. He lets Sam go free, but without his passport, he 
   can't leave Italy or take Julia with him.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    As Sam is walking home in the fog, a dark figure tries to take his 
   head off with a meat cleaver, but an old woman screams and Sam ducks, 
   the killer missing him and slicing open a water pipe on the side of a 
   building and then escapes in the fog. When Sam gets home and tells 
   Julia about his day and tells her that they will have to postpone 
   their trip to America. Julia is very understanding, but Sam will do 
   anything to get out of Italy, even turning amateur detective, with 
   Julia's help, to solve the string of unsolved murders. In the 
   meantime, Sam racks his brain, playing what he saw in the gallery in 
   his mind over and over, hoping to find that bit of information that 
   didn't fit, but he still can't pin it down. Sam and Julia figure if 
   they are going to solve the murders, they will have to start from the 
   beginning, so Sam goes to the workplace of the first female victim. 
   It turns out to be another art gallery and he talks to her boss and 
   comes home with a grotesque painting showing a person in black 
   knifing a woman in the snow. We then see the killer claiming a fourth 
   victim (Rosita Torosh; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightOfThe Devils72">NIGHT
    OF THE DEVILS</A></B> - 1972), a young woman who is lying in her bed

   previously saw in the killer's collection.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Inspector Morosini shows up at Sam's house to tell him about the 
   fourth victim and when he sees Julia, he believes he has seen her 
   before, but he can't remember where. The Inspector is aware about 
   Sam's unwanted investigation and even goes as far to make Sam a 
   potential victim when he goes on live TV to tell the Press that he is 
   close to solving the murders, but the killer phones the Inspector and 
   tells him he will have a fifth victim by the end of the week. The 
   Inspector assigns an officer to protect and follow Sam, but an 
   assassin (the unmistakable visage of Reggie Nalder; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#MarkOfTheDevil1970">MARK
    OF THE DEVIL</A></B> - 1970) hits the officer with his car and tries 
   to shoot Sam as he is walking with Julia, but Sam escapes by the skin 
   of his teeth. Sam follows the assassin, who is wearing a bright 
   yellow jacket with a big blue &quot;B&quot; on the back, which leads 
   Sam to a convention of ex-boxing officials, all who are wearing the 
   same yellow jacket. The Inspector then tells Sam and Julia that the 
   officer died of a fractured spine and skull and wants to know if Sam 
   would recognize the assassin, but Sam tells him he didn't get a clear 
   look at his face (If you saw Dalder's face for only a fraction of a 
   second, I guarantee you would never forget it, so at this time I am 
   asking myself why is Sam lying to the Inspector?). The Inspector 
   apologizes to Sam and Julia for getting them in this mess, giving Sam 
   back his passport and telling them to go to America, but Sam tells 
   him he feels he is close to solving the murders and prefers to stay 
   in Italy, so the Inspector assigns two officer to protect Sam and Julia.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The killer then claims a fifth victim, a young woman named Tina 
   (Karen Valenti), who is viciously slashed with a straight razor in 
   the elevator of her apartment building. Sam, who is getting vital 
   information from an &quot;innocent&quot; stuttering prisoner named 
   Monti (Giuseppe Castellano; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Screamers1980">SCREAMERS</A></B>

   (look for a <A HREF="j&amp;b_scotch_whiskey_in_italian_films.htm">bottle
    of J&amp;B Scotch</A>, Italy's favorite beverage). Faiena tells Sam, 
   for 100,000 lire, he will identify the yellow jacket-wearing assassin 
   and when he finds out, he will phone Sam. Sam gives him the money and 
   he leaves, telling Sam that he will contact him tomorrow morning with 
   the assassin's identity. As Faiena leaves, Sam gets a phone call from 
   the killer, who tells him, &quot;Get smart, Mr. Dalmas. Take my 
   advice, mind your own business. Stop playing detective. It's not 
   healthy. That was a warning yesterday. Wasn't it enough? Go back to 
   America. Forget about the murders. There's a limit to my 
   patience!&quot; The killer then asks if Julia is there and when Sam 
   says yes, we hear, &quot;She's very young and very beautiful, would 
   you like her to die? Because if you don't drop everything, I will 
   kill her!&quot; Sam records the conversation on a reel-to-reel tape 
   recorder, which will prove useful. He plays it for the Inspector, who 
   hears a distinct creaking sound in the recording, telling his 
   forensics team to identify it. Sam then gets a phone call from 
   Faiena, who tells him to contact &quot;Needles&quot;, giving him the 
   address, which is not far from where Sam lives. Sam goes to the 
   address, which is nothing but a hovel, the walls plastered with naked 
   pictures of women taken from porno magazines. Sam finds a hypodermic 
   needle and discovers Needles is the assassin who tried to kill him, 
   but he no longer has to worry because Needles is dead, the victim of 
   a hotshot overdose.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A forensics expert tells the Inspector and Sam that the phone call 
   the Inspector got from the killer is not the same person who called 
   Sam, because &quot;every human voice, no matter how well it's 
   disguised, has a characteristic pattern of harmonic intensities in 
   the vowel sound&quot; (a fancy way of saying the two disguised voices 
   don't match). So far, the forensics team have been unable to identify 
   the creaking sound on Sam's tape, but does this mean there are two 
   murderers or did the killer bring in an accomplice to confuse the 
   police? Sam tells the Inspector that he's sorry he won't be around to 
   see the end of this case, as he and Julia are leaving for America the 
   day after tomorrow.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    It seems everything that has been happening has cured Sam of his 
   writers block, telling Carlo that he has written over forty pages to 
   his new novel. He then plays the killer's phone call to him for Carlo 
   and he is able to identify the creaking sound, saying it reminds him 
   of something, only he can't think what it is at the moment. Carlo 
   takes the tape, telling Sam he will call him if he remembers what it 
   is. Sam suddenly gets an idea for a clue, calling the first victim's 
   boss and asking for the name of the artist that painted the grotesque 
   painting that he now has hanging over his fireplace mantle. The 
   artist's name is Berto Consalvi (Mario Adorf; <B><A HREF="action.htm#Manhunt1972">MANHUNT</A></B> 
   - 1972) and he lives in Aviano, Italy, an hour and a half car ride 
   away. Sam finds out from a local that Berto is a strange duck who has 
   boarded up all the windows and door in his house. Sure enough, when 
   Sam gets there, he has to enter Berto's house by using a ladder to 
   the second floor window (!). Berto tells Sam that he painted that 
   particular piece ten years ago, when a girlfriend was attacked by a 
   man who tried to slice her into pieces. He shows Sam some of his 
   other paintings from that period, which upsets Sam, but we don't see 
   the paintings (It's also obvious that Berto is a loon, as he catches 
   cats, puts them in cages and eats them!). While Sam is making the 
   long ride home, Julia discovers the killer is after her, trapping her 
   inside Sam's home, cutting the electricity and phone lines. Will Sam 
   be able to make it back in time to save Julia or is she doomed to be 
   murdered like the other five women? And just who is the killer? If 
   you want to know the answers to these questions as well as what 
   didn't &quot;fit&quot; in Sam's memory, you'll have to watch the 
   film, but I will give you one more piece of important information: 
   Carlo finally identifies the creaking noise as the call of the 
   &quot;Hornitus Nevalis&quot; (a species of bird that doesn't actually 
   exist), a magnificent bird with long white feathers that look like 
   glass. Why is this information important? The only place in the world 
   this bird can live is Northern Siberia, but there is one of the birds 
   being kept in Rome's zoo.&nbsp; Put on your thinking caps and get to 
   work, because everything you need to know about the killer's identity 
   is in this review.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   fake-out the viewer and put the heroes of the story in more danger. 
   It was also the first of his giallo films to use the hero's memory 
   for the most important clue. Since this film was made before VHS or 
   the advent of home video, audiences had to take Sam's word for the 
   thing that didn't fit in his memory, because they couldn't rewind the 
   footage to see it for themselves. So, is that &quot;thing&quot; 
   actually there? Well, yes and no. Yes, because it can be taken that 
   way and, no, because I did rewind the footage and the way Sam 
   remembered it is not actually shown in that sequence. Is it a cheat 
   on the audience? Not really, because all the clues to the killer's 
   identity are clearly in the film. But none of that is really 
   important, because this is the first film that Dario Argento 
   directed, giving us an insight to a future master at work. This is 
   also the film that caused a boom in the giallo film business from 
   1970 to 1975, as many giallo films that followed it had the names of 
   animals (or insects) in their titles. For this, Argento gets my 
   utmost appreciation because some of the giallo films that followed 
   were memorable, some were just okay and others were awful, but 
   there's no denying that they were still better than anything being 
   churned out by Hollywood. All fans of the giallo flicks have Argento 
   to thank for making the genre popular, whether you like to admit it 
   or not. Sure, giallo films were being made before this, but without 
   this film, they would have died quicker than they did. This film's 
   popularity all over the world gave filmmakers the impetus to make 
   more mystery films, full of outrageous nudity and graphic violence, 
   which is why we should be thanking him.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   is Cassinelli with a <A HREF="j&amp;b_scotch_whiskey_in_italian_films.htm">bottle
    of J&amp;B Scotch</A>, so you know you're in for something very Italian!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see crime boss Rizzo (Balsam) phoning Guido Mauri 
   (Cassinelli) and telling him that Marco (Carmelo 'Roberto' Reale; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#YoungViolentDan1976">YOUNG,
    VIOLENT, DANGEROUS</A></B> - 1976) is on his way to pick him up, he 
   should be there in five minutes. Guido tells him that he'll be ready 
   and Guido's girl, Maria (Olga Karlatos; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DamnedInVenice1978">DAMNED
    IN VENICE</A></B> - 1978), tells him she can't sleep, she's too 
   worried for him, Guido telling her everything is going to be fine. As 
   he walks out the door to meet Marco, he tells Maria he will be back 
   at five and if anything goes wrong, she knows where the money is, 
   ending with telling her he is just going to an insurance company a 
   few blocks away (Way to calm her down, Guido!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Marco picks up Guido and we learn that they are pulling a heist, 
   stealing a load of uncut diamonds that Guido is giving to Rizzo in 
   exchange for 40 million lira, not for the diamonds, but for pulling 
   the job (He wants to retire from the business). Marco tells Guido 
   that Rizzo doesn't treat him fairly, as he gets nothing 
   &quot;extra&quot; for pulling jobs and he knows he will never make it 
   &quot;big&quot; in Rizzo's organization, telling Guido the only time 
   he gets to pull jobs is as his assistant, never on his own. They then 
   arrive at the insurance agency building and Marco starts breaking 
   into the safe with an acetylene torch, but someone phones the police 
   and tells them that a burglary is taking place at the insurance 
   agency. Before Marco can open the safe, the police arrive, so Guido 
   keeps them busy by firing his pistol at them to give Marco time to 
   escape. Guido then surrenders and Marco escapes, but he breaks his 
   right leg jumping off a brick wall and hobbles to his car. Is all 
   this trivia important? Damn right it is!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    As the opening credits play, we see Guido being released from prison 
   after serving a five-year sentence for attempted burglary and 
   attempted murder of the police. Maria is outside the prison waiting 
   for him and they kiss for the first time since he was arrested. Maria 
   tells Guido that Marco couldn't come because he had some work to do 
   at his garage. She says Marco is lame and limps badly since the night 
   he broke his leg escaping from the police. She also tells Guido that 
   Marco helped her a lot when his money ran out and hopes he is 
   finished with that &quot;life&quot; once and for all. Guido doesn't 
   answer her, but it is obvious he wants to discover who tipped off the 
   police at the failed diamond heist. On the bus ride back to her 
   apartment, Guido asks Maria how her son Enzo is doing. She says he 
   left her apartment after Guido was sent to prison and got himself his 
   own place and a job at the freight office at the airport. He is also 
   involved with a girl named Lisa that she doesn't like, not saying 
   why. The bus is then forced off the road by two thugs in a car 
   wearing ski masks. They wave their guns around and force all the 
   people to get off the bus. The thugs then try to steal the luggage 
   off the top of the bus and Guido tells Maria that they must be 
   Rizzo's men, but it looks like they are looking for something, which 
   they do not find. Guido sees a car approaching and runs to it, pulls 
   the driver out of the car and hops in the front seat, yelling for 
   Maria to come join him, but one of the thugs shoots her in the back, 
   killing her. After seeing Maria getting shot, Guido runs over one of 
   the thugs and crashes into their car, making it explode. He grabs one 
   of their machine guns and shoots the thugs, killing them and then 
   cradles Maria's body in his arms, vowing to get even with Rizzo, but 
   is Rizzo even involved?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Guido is cleared of any wrongdoing by Commissioner Russo (Vittorio 
   Caprioli; <B><A HREF="shoot_first_die_later_1974_raro_dvd.htm">SHOOT 
   FIRST, DIE LATER</A></B> - 1974), who tells him all the passengers on 
   the bus called him a hero and that he killed the thugs in 
   self-defense. The Commissioner tells Guido he is sorry about Maria 
   because &quot;that woman was good for you.&quot; Guido doesn't feel 
   much like a hero, as a matter of fact he is more determined to find 
   out who ratted him out, as well as trying to determine why Rizzo's 
   thugs picked his bus to rob and what they were looking for. The 
   Commissioner, who knows Guido, asks him what he is going to do with 
   his life and he says work with Marco at his garage. The Commissioner 
   wants to know if Marco was involved in the failed diamond heist 
   (telling Guido it is too late for him to do anything about it, he's 
   just curious) and Guido says nothing and gets up to walk out. He does 
   ask the Commissioner for a favor, though. He wants him to locate Enzo 
   because he no longer lived with Maria since he was arrested and he 
   would like to talk to him. The Commissioner says he will do his best 
   but warns Guido to stay away from Rizzo if he knows what's good for 
   him (The Commissioner has been trying to nail Rizzo, but he always 
   walks away squeaky clean).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Guido then enters Maria's apartment for the first time in five 
   years, only to discover that local hood Tony (a terrific <A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_3.htm#PierPaoloCapponi">Pier
    Paolo Capponi</A>; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SevenBloodOrchids72">SEVEN
    BLOOD-STAINED ORCHIDS</A></B> - 1972) and a couple of his boys, all 
   who work for Rizzo, are waiting for him. They rough-up Guido, Tony 
   saying he got information that he was talking to the cops and 
   mentioning Rizzo's name. He tells Guido if he wants to live, he is 
   never to mention Rizzo's name again, yelling to Guido, &quot;Conform! 
   Conform!&quot; (his favorite word). It is apparent that the same 
   snitch that got Guido arrested five years ago is also involved with 
   spilling the beans to Tony, but who can it be?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Enzo (Alberto Squillante; <B><A HREF="#MadDog1977">MAD DOG</A></B> 
   - 1977) and Lisa (Barbara Bouchet; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#BlackBellyTarantula">BLACK
    BELLY OF THE TARANTULA</A></B> - 1971) in the Commissioner's office, 
   Enzo telling him that he wants nothing to do with Guido, because 
   first he made trouble when his mother was alive and now he is 
   responsible for her death. He has a good paying job at the airport 
   and doesn't want to lose it if his employer finds out he is related 
   to a jailbird. Guido then meets Marco for the first time in five 
   years and discovers that Rizzo kicked Marco out of his organization 
   because &quot; he's got no rooms for gimps in it&quot;, but Rizzo is 
   always sending him work at his garage, repairing his fleet of cars 
   and when he needs a new car, he finds him one, telling Guido that 
   it's honest work. Guido is confused, as he thought he left enough 
   money for Maria to last for five years, but Marco tells him he helped 
   her financially after the first year and she even got a job as a maid 
   until she got too sick to do it. Why didn't Maria tell him any of 
   this and where did his money go?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Tony and his goons then pay Guido and Marco a visit at the garage, 
   Tony telling Guido that they have plenty of informants in the police 
   department and if he wants to keep mentioning Rizzo's name, he should 
   go straight to Rizzo instead and clear things up. Guido then goes to 
   the Commissioner's office, finding Enzo and Lisa inside. Enzo calls 
   him a &quot;big shit&quot; (instead of &quot;big shot&quot;) and 
   demands the key to his mother's apartment, telling him never to go 
   there again. Guido obliges, handing him the keys and then Enzo and 
   Lisa leave, As soon as Guido leaves the building, Tony is waiting for 
   him, gun in hand and makes him get in the car, saying Rizzo wants to 
   talk to him (&quot;He sent a shiny new car just for you!&quot;, says Tony).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Guido gets to Rizzo's place, he refuses to shake Rizzo's hand, 
   telling him he doesn't want to talk to him. Rizzo says that's okay, 
   but he'll have to listen to what he has to say. Rizzo tells Guido 
   that five years in prison is a long time. Someone may have squealed 
   on him, but he doesn't remember. What he does remember is that after 
   he got caught by the police, he had to go to France for six months 
   until the heat died down. He remembers sending Guido his expensive 
   lawyers to help him out at prison, which he kicked out in not such a 
   nice manner. He remembers offering Maria a large sum of money to help 
   her out, which she refused to take. He then asks Guido why he won't 
   shake his hand and then gives him one more chance to do so, but Guido 
   refuses, telling him, &quot;The day after the robbery you were 
   supposed to give me forty million lire and I found out later that 
   there was only two million lira worth of diamonds in that insurance 
   agency safe. You must have known there were only peanuts in that 
   safe. And you sent me, why?&quot; Rizzo says he doesn't remember, it 
   was a long time ago. Guido says to Rizzo, &quot;Kill me Rizzo, here, 
   now. Because I'll kill you the first chance I get.&quot; &quot;Aw, 
   Guido, you mustn't talk to me like that&quot;, replies Rizzo. He 
   hands Guido a check for what he owes him (with compounded interest!) 
   and gives him three days to leave town and never come back. If he 
   ever sees him after that, he's a dead man. Guido refuses to take the 
   check, but Rizzo still gives him three days to disappear or else he 
   will be swimming with the fishes. What would you do if you were 
   Guido? He is escorted out by Tony, who tells Guido that he is going 
   to have a couple of his boys follow him around for the next three 
   days and if he doesn't leave town, he'll shoot him in the mouth, even 
   if he's in church listening to Mass!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then learn that Enzo and Lisa aren't as clean as they pretend to 
   be. Lisa is a stripper and she and Enzo are planning a diamond heist 
   of their own at the airport, with Rizzo's help, and are planning to 
   pin the blame on Guido, setting him up. What they don't know is that 
   Guido has bought some guns from an illegal weapons trader (Raul 
   Lovecchio; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BlackMagicRites1973">BLACK 
   MAGIC RITES</A></B> - 1973) and he's not afraid to use them (When 
   Tony finds out, he knocks out the dealer cold!). As the third day 
   approaches, Marco tells Guido he better leave town, but he tells 
   Marco he is not going to leave town until he gets justice. When Guido 
   discovers who the squealer is, it will take you by surprise almost as

   (1980), just to mention a few. This is an intricately plotted film, 
   where no one is whom they seem to be, especially Rizzo. And since 
   thieves cannot be trusted, Enzo ends up on the wrong side of the gun 
   when the diamond heist is pulled at the airport, the masked thieves 
   shooting and killing him point blank, as well as all the employees, 
   at the freight office.&nbsp; It turns out Lisa knew Enzo would be 
   killed, so she makes sure she is with Guido when it happens, giving 
   both of them alibis, but why? Martin Balsam is particularly good as 
   Rizzo. We never believe a word of what he says, but when it all turns<A HREF="blood_and_diamonds_1977.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blood and diamonds italy poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   out to be true, we see what he is really made of in the finale and 
   what he does will touch your heart. There is also some brutal 
   violence on view, some of it quite unexpected, especially the way 
   Guido deals with Tony towards the end of the film (it's a great, 
   long, fight scene). While we expect to see the beautiful Barbara 
   Bouchet with her clothes off when we learn she is a stripper, she 
   really doesn't strip (dammit!), except for one brief scene when we 
   see her in bed with Tony (!), as in her stripper scenes, she dances 
   around in a tiny white bikini (yowza!) at the strip club while all 
   the other strippers prance around topless. If there is a moral to 
   this film, it can best be described that money changes everyone and 
   that change is usually not for the better; it can be downright 
   deadly. It's also hard to top Claudio Cassinelli when it comes to 
   portraying criminals with a grudge. He is not able to see past his 
   prejudices as to whom the guilty parties are and nearly pays for it 
   with his life, but one person is there to forgive him and it's thanks 
   to Balsam's great acting that makes us believe that crime bosses can 
   have hearts to forgive, even for the most major sins. He may be a 
   killer, but he has compassion, too. Even Vittorio Caprioli as 
   Inspector Russo has some funny lines, such as what he says to Rizzo 
   towards the end of the film: &quot;You're giving me a large pain in 
   my sphincter!&quot; Both Balsam and Cassinelli make this a film you 
   must see and if you enjoy Eurocrime flicks as much as I do, you 
   probably already know that it is hard to go wrong with the ones 
   directed by Fernando Di Leo and this one is no exception. Need I say more?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    LINK</A><A NAME="BloodLink1983"></A> (1983) -</B> Worthwhile 
   thriller (think of it as a horror-themed version of The Corsican 
   Brothers) about a man, Dr. Craig Mannings (the always 
   enjoyable-to-watch Michael Moriarity; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Reborn">REBORN</A></B> 
   - 1981), who suddenly begins to have visions of a serial killer 
   murdering women. Craig not only sees the murders through the killer's 
   eyes, he also experiences the emotions of the killer, including the 
   euphoria of murder. These visions began when Craig decided to use 
   himself as a guinea pig in an experimental treatment he created, 
   which effectively lets the subject control such things as pain and 
   human emotions. The experiment triggers long-dormant memories about 
   Dr. Manning's childhood, especially concerning his Siamese twin 
   brother Keith. It seems Keith disappeared when an operation was 
   performed to separate them, so Craig decides to find out the truth 
   about his brother. He travels to Cleveland to talk to Keith's foster 
   mother, Mrs. Thomason (Geraldine Fitzgerald), who has gone senile (or 
   crazy) and mistakens Craig for Keith and accuses him of starting a 
   fire that killed her husband when Keith was seventeen years old. 
   Craig becomes convinces that the visions he is having are actually 
   his brother's, so he heads for Hamburg, Germany, based on a visual <A HREF="blood_link_1983b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blood link german vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="174" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>clue
    he picked up in one of the visions. Once in Hamburg, the lives of 
   Craig and Keith become fatally intertwined due to bouts of mistaken 
   identity, including over-the-hill boxer Bud Waldo (Cameron Mitchell; <B><A HREF="martial arts.htm#Raw Force">RAW
    FORCE</A></B> - 1982), who confused Keith with Craig, and police 
   Inspector Hessinger (Reinhold K. Olszewski), who is looking for Keith 
   in connection with a series of murders in the area and mistakens 
   Craig as the culprit. Craig soon becomes convinced that Keith is a 
   sadistic murderer and when Keith discovers Craig is in Hamburg, he 
   kills Bud (It's a really sadistic scene that's bloodless in it's 
   execution, but vicious all the same) in front of his daughter 
   Christine (Sarah Lagenfeld) while pretending to be Craig. Since Bud 
   had a bad ticker, Sarah can't convince the police that he has been 
   murdered, so she tries to get some justice on her own, only with the 
   wrong brother. Craig is able to convince Sarah that she is after the 
   wrong person and when it becomes obvious that Keith can also see 
   through Craig's eyes, it becomes a cat-and-mouse game between 
   brothers, where Keith wants to kill Craig for unresolved childhood 
   issues and Craig only wants to save Keith from himself. When Craig is 
   arrested for the murder of Christine, Craig and his assistant/lover 
   Julie (Penelope Milford) come up with an unusual way to trap the 
   murderous Keith. It almost backfires, but as the finale proves, the 
   bond between brothers, especially Siamese twins, is impossible to 
   kill, even in death. This well-paced thriller, directed by Alberto De 
   Martino (<B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Tempter">THE TEMPTER</A></B> - 
   1974; <B><A HREF="short reviews.htm#Miami Horror">MIAMI HORROR</A></B> 
   - 1985; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#FormulaMurder1985">FORMULA 
   FOR A MURDER</A></B> - 1985) and scripted by Theodore Apstein (a 
   well-respected Broadway and television writer; this is one of his 
   rare forays into film and his last writing credit), is helped 
   immensely by the dual performances of Michael Moriarity. We get the 
   best of both worlds from Moriarity: The restrained turn as loving 
   brother Craig and the full-tilt insanity that is Keith. The scene 
   where Keith puts a beatdown on Bud in order to give him a fatal heart 
   attack is one of the film's highlights, as it displays Moriarity's 
   unique ability to come across as someone truly heartless who is able 
   to kill with a smile on his face. He never breaks his smile as he 
   pummels Bud to death, which makes the entire sequence very hard to 
   watch (it also one of Cameron Mitchell's best performances of his 
   latter career). Another well-done sequence is when Keith drugs and 
   knocks-out Craig after he has just made love to Christine and then 
   jumps in bed with her pretending to be Craig. She discovers a little 
   too late that Keith's separation scar is on the wrong side of his 
   body, as Keith rapes Christine, makes her tell him that he's a better 
   lover than Craig and then sadistically stabs her to death as he 
   ejaculates. Director De Martino offers several nice visual touches, 
   including the use of mirrors or reflections in windows to trigger 
   Craig's visions and some effective POV shots during Keith's murders. 
   There's also a jolting scene in a mortuary during the final five 
   minutes that will send a shiver down your spine. Although the gore is 
   fairly restrained (just a few bloody stabbings), there is plentiful 
   female nudity and a sense of absurd playfulness here, thanks to the 
   acting talents of Moriarity, who manages to convey the duality of 
   good and evil by simply using weird character tics (like twirling his 
   hair with his index finger) to separate the brothers, giving them 
   both distinct personalities and relying on talent rather than makeup. 
   Worth a look. The effective music score is from the always reliable 
   Ennio Morricone, who also adds to the atmosphere with his haunting 
   soundtrack. Also starring Martha Smith, Virginia McKenna and Vonne 
   Sherman. Originally announced as <B><A HREF="link_1983.htm">THE LINK</A></B>.

   savagely stabbed to death and several eyewitnesses see a man in a hat 
   and a tan raincoat running out of the park. Police Inspector Berardi 
   (Silvano Tranquilli; <B><A HREF="action.htm#ViolentProfession73">THE 
   VIOLENT PROFESSIONALS</A></B> - 1973) is assigned to the case and he 
   finds finds a switchblade (a &quot;butterfly&quot; knife) next to her 
   body and in her pockets are all the bus and subway tickets she used 
   for the past three weeks. Why would she keep those tickets? (Think 
   about it for a moment). During her autopsy, the coroner tells the 
   Inspector that Fran&ccedil;oise has five stab wounds on her body, two 
   of them fatal (We see photos of these wounds and it's not pretty). 
   The forensics team tell the inspector that she was not sexually 
   assaulted and that she struggled with the killer, scratching him. All 
   they are sure of is that the killer is Caucasian. The Inspector is 
   sure Fran&ccedil;oise knew her killer because &quot;A girl like that 
   doesn't go on a date with a stranger at 6:00 P.M.&quot; Based on all 
   this evidence and a female eyewitness, the Inspector arrests 
   Alessandro Marchi (Giancarlo Sbragia; <B><A HREF="death_rage_1976.htm">DEATH
    RAGE</A></B> - 1976), a famous TV sportscaster. At his trial for 
   first degree murder, the prosecutor (Wolfgang Preiss; <B><A HREF="fifth_cord_1971.htm">THE

   (G&uuml;nther Stoll; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#WhatDoneSolange1972">WHAT
    HAVE YOU DONE TO SOLANGE?</A></B> - 1972), puts on an equally good 
   show, giving the jurists an alternate view on the evidence, none of 
   it linking to Alessandro. But when Alessandro's wife, Maria (Evelyn 
   Stewart; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightChild1975">THE NIGHT CHILD</A></B> 
   - 1975), takes the stand, her answers under questioning couldn't make 
   her husband look more guilty if he tried. Maria sat in court every 
   day at her husband's trial, but she wasn't there to support him, but 
   to hear him confess that he was having an affair with Marta Clerici 
   (Lorella De Luca; <B><A HREF="three_tough_guys_1974.htm">THREE TOUGH GUYS</A></B> 
   - 1974), a rich young woman who has disappeared. Since Marta can't be 
   located to take the stand and tell the court that she was with 
   Alessandro at the time of Fran&ccedil;oise's killing, the court has 
   no choice but to ignore Alessandro's infidelity alibi. He is 
   convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. 
   Soon after Alessandro is put in prison, another killing occurs. A 
   young woman is knifed to death in the same manner as Fran&ccedil;oise.
    The Inspector must figure out who committed that murder so 
   Alessandro can be freed.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The list of suspects is long. We then find out why Maria really put

   Maria has no sympathy for Alessandro and shames their daughter, Sarah 
   (Wendi D'Olive; <B><A HREF="#DeadAreAlive">THE DEAD ARE ALIVE</A></B>

    The Inspector (Who is always looking for a perfect cup of coffee, 
   but cannot find it. It's a running joke in this film.) gets a phone 
   call from someone who says he's the killer. He also says that the 
   killings will continue. This forces the Inspector to look at the 
   killings from a different angle. He finds Marta Clerici and 
   Alessandro's case is reopened. She testifies, telling the court that 
   she was making love to Alessandro at the time Fran&ccedil;oise was 
   murdered. Her testimony is convincing, but is she telling the truth? 
   Alessandro is freed, which disappoints many people, especially his 
   wife. It seems everyone here has some sort of secret thay are 
   harboring and don't want exposed, even Sarah. The Inspector now 
   believes Alessandro is innocent and when a shop owner tells him that

   at the pier. Why does Sandra stare at them so intensely?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While eating in a restaurant, Stefano tells his brother that he 
   feels &quot;washed out&quot; and that he may need a neurologist. 
   Sefano sees a young man hand an older woman (Alina De Simone; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Church1989">THE
    CHURCH</A></B> - 1989), who is eating alone, an envelope full of 
   cash. Stefano asks Paolo who the woman is and he says, &quot;There's 
   something frightening about her.&quot; She is a medium who 
   &quot;practices strange rites in her house&quot;. Paolo fills his 
   brother in on other people in town who are regular clients of the 
   medium. There's Dr. Aloisi (Sergio Mioni; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Exterminators 3000">EXTERMINATORS
    OF THE YEAR 3000</A></B> - 1983), a rich man who practices medicine 
   on the island and in Venice. He is a heavy gambler and has a mistress 
   in Venice. He is also an athiest who &quot;accidentally&quot; killed 
   his wife while cleaning his rifle (sure) but his money bought him out 
   of a trial. Paolo doesn't know Dr. Aloisi is sitting behind him at 
   the restaurant and he lets the priest know he heard everything he 
   said about him before he gets up and leaves the restaurant. Another 
   client of the medium is Mrs. Nardi (Juliette Mayniel; <B><A HREF="dog_lay_afternoon_1976.htm">DOG
    LAY AFTERNOON</A></B> - 1976), a midwife who has a crazy son she 
   keeps hidden on the island. Oh, and she performs illegal abortions. 
   And, finally, there's Count Pedrazzi (Massimo Serato; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#WomenCellBlock71973">WOMEN
    IN CELL BLOCK 7</A></B> - 1973), a &quot;despicable&quot; individual 
   who's the last of &quot;a once great noble family.&quot; Paolo also 
   says that the Count has no morals and &quot;it might be better if he 
   disappeared off the face of the Earth&quot; (I can now understand why 
   Stefano left the island!). We then witness the medium holding a 
   seance with these three people. Who are they trying to contact? We do 
   know that the medium is tape recording all her sessions. Is she up to 
   no good?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    That night, Paolo is woken from a sound sleep by the screams of the 
   medium, who is being strangled outside his bedroom window. Paolo 
   can't see who is killing her because it is very windy and raining 
   outside. He calls the police and then goes to wake Stefano, but he is 
   not in his bedroom. His bed doesn't look like it has been slept in (I 
   know what you are thinking, but don't rush to judgment. This is a 
   giallo film, after all!). Paolo can't even find Gaspare, but when he 
   opens the front door, both Gaspare and Stefano are standing outside, 
   soaking wet. Paolo tells them about the murder he just witnessed, but 
   when he goes outside to show them where it happened, there is no 
   body. Later that night, someone slips an envelope under Paolo's 
   bedroom door. In the envelope are an old photo, showing a priest, an 
   old woman and a young boy, and a threatening note that reads, &quot;If
    one speaks of murder, yours will be talked about.&quot; Who would 
   threaten the life of a priest? The next morning, the police find the 
   medium's body close to the church and the Police Commissioner 
   (Alfredo Zammi) tells Paolo that the medium's killing mirrors that of 
   the killing of a young girl that happened years earlier on the island 
   (the killing we saw at the start of the film). Her last name was 
   &quot;Andreani&quot; and her father (Luigi Casellato; <B><A HREF="black_ribbon_for_deborah_1974.htm">A
    BLACK RIBBON FOR DEBORAH</A></B> - 1974) still lives on the island. 
   When Stefano sees the dead body, he has a flashback where he sees a 
   young boy screaming in a meadow (the boys looks like the one in the 
   photo slid under Paolo's door) and then Stefano has some kind of 
   attack and Paolo has to walk him back to the house. One of his 
   parishioners tells Paolo that the Count molested one of her children 
   and he goes to the Count's mansion and accuses him of pedophilia 
   (Shouldn't it be the other way around?). The Count kicks Paolo out of 
   his mansion, telling him he will never be welcome here, not even 
   &quot;if I'm dead&quot; (A portend of things to come?).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While Stefano is out for a walk, he runs into Sandra. She tells him 
   she knew the medium&nbsp; and she believes she blackmailed her 
   clients (We also find out that Stefano is an art professor at a 
   university). They meet Mrs. Nardi on the street, who tells Sandra 
   that she hopes her mother is feeling better. Why does Mr. Andreani, 
   who is also standing on the street, look at them with such hatred in 
   his eyes? Stefano finds another threatening note that reads, &quot;The
    past and your fate are linked with death.&quot; We then discover 
   that the photo was that of a young Stefano with his brother and their 
   deceased mother. Poalo starts going off the hinges, so Paolo tries to 
   calm him down by yelling at him!</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Someone is following Sandra as she is taking the ferry to Venice. 
   Once in Venice, Sandra becomes aware that she is being followed, 
   walking quickly through the narrow streets and alleyways until she 
   makes it to her mother's apartment (but not before she bumps into an 
   accordion player, in one of the film's many jump scares). We then 
   find out it was Stefano following her. He tells Sandra that he was 
   worried she was leaving the island for good. Sandra introduces him to 
   her infirmed mother (Laura Nucci; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#KillerNun1978">KILLER
    NUN</A></B> - 1979), but not before he becomes extremely interested 
   in a strange painting hanging on a wall. It has the&nbsp; Devil&nbsp; 
   about to snatch a young woman and it is familiar to Stefano (pay 
   close attention to the painting's background). Stefano has one of his 
   spells in the mother's apartment, but he refuses to tell Sandra what 
   caused it. Sandra and Stefano soon become lovers, but is it a good idea?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Mrs. Nardi goes to Dr. Aloisi's office and tells him she is worried

   the Count will tell them? Someone then kills the Count in his 
   mansion, thrusting an ancient spear into his chest. While Paolo is 
   holding Sunday services, he find the bloody decapitated head of a 
   small animal in an altar vessel, a note under it saying, &quot;Just <A HREF="bloodstained_shadow_1978_italy_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bloodstained shadow italy poster8 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="229" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>remember,

   notes, as the letter &quot;T&quot; looks unusual and must have all 
   come from the same typewriter. If he can find the typewriter, he will 
   find the killer. For some reason I still can't understand, Stefano 
   believes it is all connected to the murder of the Andreani girl, so 
   he goes to talk with her father. He tells Stefano if he wants to live 
   in peace on the island, it is better not to know. Not to know what?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This spiraling giallo makes you ask a lot of questions and the 
   patient viewer will get the answers, no matter how outlandish they 
   are. Not a great giallo flick by any stretch of the imagination, the 
   screenplay, by director Antonio Bido, Marisa Andal&ograve; &amp; 
   Domenico Malan (this is Andal&ograve; and Malan's only screenplay), 
   paints everyone as a suspect, even the minor characters. That is 
   exactly what is wrong with this film. If anyone can be the killer, 
   who can we root for? The violence and nudity are also far too 
   restrained for the film's good (and Stefania Casini has the breasts 
   of a 10 year-old girl!). The most gruesome murder comes when the 
   killer grabs Sandra's mother out of her wheelchair and places her 
   head into the lit fireplace. Although we really don't see anything 
   graphic (except the back of her head burning), it is still quite 
   effective. The most intense scene is when Dr. Aloisi is pushed into a 
   canal by the killer and the doctor tries to escape by clinging to a 
   rope from a passing boat. The killer than steals a boat and crashes 
   it into the other boat, crushing the doctor to death. This film also 
   relies on that old giallo standby: Only showing the killer's eyes in 
   extreme close-up. Also typical is introducing Mrs. Nardi's crazy son 
   late in the film. It is obvious he is a red herring and serves no 
   other purpose in this film (He has a doll he plays with and his 
   mother enables his behavior). Just who then is the killer? You should 
   know by now that I never give that away, but the clues are in the 
   review and you do not need to know anything more to figure it out 
   (OK, one more clue: The painting is the key to solve the mystery, so 
   pay close attention when it is shown.). The English dubbing is also 
   rank, as what is said rarely synch with the actors' lip movements 
   (even though it is obvious Craig Hill is speaking English and dubbed 
   his own voice!). Fans of giallo films will probably find something 
   here to enjoy, but I found it to be a fairly long 109 minutes. The 
   finale is satisfying, though, in a twisted sort of way.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   for Corman. He pulls you into the story and makes you really care 
   about Harrison and Riker. You want their relationship to work out. 
   Simon also fills the screen with unusual situations including an 
   early scene of Russian Roulette played with one bullet and five

   director/writer Michael Feifer (<B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Graveyard2006">THE
    GRAVEYARD</A></B> - 2006), this one a mostly fictionalized account 
   about the notorious Dennis Rader (Kane Hodder; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hatchet2007">HATCHET</A></B> 
   - 2007), a seemingly normal married man who murdered ten people 
   between 1974 and 1991 in and around Wichita, Kansas and then wrote 
   taunting letters to the police, signing the letters &quot;BTK&quot; 
   (for &quot;Bind Torture Kill&quot;). As the film opens, Rader (who 
   has already been killing for nearly twenty years) is playing bondage 
   games with a prostitute in a hotel room. When the prostitute senses 
   that there is something creepy about Rader, she leaves him tied to a 
   chair and escapes out the bathroom window onto the fire escape, but 
   she drops her wallet as she is running down the stairs. Rader is 
   enraged and vows to kill her and, after he finds her wallet, he can 
   kill her any time he wants (He has a flashback showing him torturing 
   a tied-up woman in the middle of a field, then killing her by 
   stomping on her head and then burying her in a shallow grave). We 
   next see Rader waking up in his bed at home, having breakfast with 
   his wife Susan (Amy London) and two teenage daughters and then 
   heading out to work as Park City's only Compliance Officer (a 
   pseudo-cop who issues tickets for nuisance infractions like blocking 
   the sidewalk and failure to cut the grass), a job he clearly enjoys 
   enforcing <A HREF="btk_2007.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/b.t.k. poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="201" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(and
    it affords him to pick future victims). When one woman gives Rader a 
   hard time when he warns her about her dog roaming around freely 
   without a leash, he returns to her home later that night, ties her 
   up, rambles on about having a sexual problem (&quot;I don't get what 
   I need at home. My body produces an abnormal amount of 
   testosterone!&quot;), asphyxiates her with a plastic bag, rapes her 
   (offscreen) and then returns home to have dinner with his family, 
   where we learn that he has just been appointed President of his local 
   church! Rader then continues his murder spree by shooting a man 
   point-blank and strangling his girlfriend (the act of choking her 
   gets him off), kidnapping a teenage girl off the street in broad 
   daylight and then driving a lost little girl home (with the wounded 
   and unconscious teenage girl in the back of his van!), where he 
   berates the young girl's mother for not minding her child (Rader 
   later kills the teenage girl by throwing her in a shallow grave and 
   impaling her in the stomach with a shovel). Rader's home life begins 
   to unravel when wife Susan discovers he lied about chaperoning a Boy 
   Scout weekend (it was actually cancelled two weeks earlier). He's 
   really going to the home of the prostitute who left him tied-up in 
   the hotel room, first shooting her husband in the head, but failing 
   to kill her when he begins hallucinating that he's strangling one of 
   his daughters. This proves to be his undoing, as on his drive home he 
   is stopped by a cop for speeding. He kills the cop by throwing him 
   into the path of an oncoming car and ends up hunted by the police 
   when they inform Rader's family about his crime and discover evidence 
   about him being the BTK Killer in his workshop. Rader is eventually 
   captured and immediately confesses all of his crimes once he realizes 
   the cops have DNA evidence.&nbsp; As far as serial killer films go, <B><A HREF="btk_2007b.htm">B.T.K.</A></B> 
   falls somewhere in the middle. Since this is a fictitious account of 
   Dennis Rader's final days as a free man, there's not much historical 
   value here, but Kane Hodder does a pretty credible job portraying a 
   man who clearly has a hatred for women, thanks to a clinging wife who 
   was only able to bear him female offspring, which he then spent their 
   childhood ignoring (it's clear he would have preferred sons). He also 
   clearly enjoys the power that comes with his job as Compliance 
   Officer (yet it's obvious he would much rather be a cop, but he would 
   never pass the psych exam), as he gets sexual pleasure issuing 
   tickets and talking down to the town's women for performing minor 
   infractions, threatening to send their dogs to the pound to be put to 
   sleep or calling Child Services for not watching their children. Director/producer/scripter

   facility. Paul, who is a college art teacher and amateur painter, 
   discovers the collusion between Dr. Houston, Flanders Davenport and 
   the judge, so he decides that his only means of recourse is deadly 
   revenge (he makes the decision after he pukes-up chunks of 
   god-knows-what while having a Vietnam flashback). He fashions a 
   circular saw-like device that he attaches to his bum hand and goes 
   after Dr. Houston first, cutting off the fingers of the doctor's 
   right hand before performing an autopsy on him while he's still 
   alive. Paul then creates a flame-thrower device for his hand, goes to 
   the judge's house and burns him alive. Paul doesn't even try to get 
   creative with Davenport (Paul doesn't believe he deserves it, but I 
   think the budget ran out of money for another device), opting to blow 
   his brains out with a pistol while waiting for him in the back seat 
   of his car. Paul saves most of his rage for Tommy, as he creates a 
   mechanical hand capable of crushing a cue ball into powder and then 
   uses it on Tommy's balls while he is getting a massage in a 
   whorehouse. The police detective in charge of the case lets Paul go 
   free, as long as Paul and Julia leave town for good. Why does he do 
   this (besides probably watching <B><A HREF="death_wish_1974.htm">DEATH
    WISH</A></B> [1974] a hundred times)? Let's just say the detective 
   has a wife at home with a bum hand, also caused by the malpractice of 
   Dr. Houston and then taken advantage of by Davenport and the judge. 
   Small world, isn't it?&nbsp; Impossibly cheap in every department 
   (the sound recording and music soundtrack take top honors for 
   annoyance, followed by the bottom-rung acting abilities of the cast, 
   especially Rishi Bhardwaj as the town's Arabic Chief of Police!), 
   director Joel Denning (who also co-directed <B><A HREF="swarm_of_the_snakehead_2006.htm">SWARM
    OF THE SNAKEHEAD</A></B> - 2006) makes a valiant effort in trying to 
   fashion a silk purse from a sow's ear, but comes up empty. The 
   special effects are low-rent (when Paul cuts-off the surgeon's 
   fingers, there's no gushing blood), some scenes seem like they belong 
   in a totally different film (such as when the cop in charge of the 
   investigation questions a Nietche-quoting bum or the strip club 
   finale, which seems to serve no other purpose than to pad out the 
   film's running time) and Jack McClernan as Paul is so dull as the 
   vigilante, I wanted to stick his head in an electric knife sharpener. 
   Toss-in some dizzying handheld camerawork where the film stock 
   changes from scene-to-scene and what you end up with is a weak 
   late-entry into <B>DEATH WISH</B> territory. Filmed in Baltimore, 
   Maryland and &quot;inspired by Robert Rodriguez&quot;. Ha! He wishes.

   A woman gets on the crowded elevator of her highrise apartment

   to death by someone wearing flesh-colored latex gloves and 
   brandishing a scalpel. When the doors open on the top floor, three

   the police arrives, saying she is late for her job (she wrestles men 
   at a casino for money!). Meanwhile, beautiful model Jennifer Lansbury 
   (Edwige Fenech; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#StripNudeKiller">STRIP
    NUDE FOR YOUR KILLER</A></B> - 1975) is being stalked by Adam (Ben 
   Carra; <B><A HREF="super_bitch_1973.htm">SUPER BITCH</A></B> - 1973), 
   the leader of a sex cult that Jennifer once belonged to, but has 
   since left (Adam believes her to be his wife, since he conducted a 
   ritual &quot;marriage&quot; to her in the cult). Adam nearly drugs 
   her while she is walking to her car one night (he wants to free her 
   from the temptation of other men), but she manages to get away with a 
   well-placed elbow to his gut. The mysterious gloved killer then 
   murders Mizar in her own apartment, delivering a karate blow to her 
   throat, tying her up and drowning her in the bathtub. 
   Stamp-collecting Police Commissioner Enci (Giampiero Albertini; <B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#ManyWarsAgo1970">MANY
    WARS AGO</A></B> - 1970) is assigned to the case and begins 
   questioning suspects, first beginning at the casino where Mizar 
   worked (the Commissioner at first believes the killer could be a 
   disgruntled male customer who lost to her in a wrestling match). Rich 
   advertising executive Andrea Barto (George Hilton; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#StrangeViceWardh71">THE
    STRANGE VICE OF MRS. WARDH</A></B> - 1971), who was going to use 
   Mizar in his latest ad campaign, uses his influence to get Jennifer 
   and her friend, Marilyn (Paola Quattrini; <B><A HREF="hercules_1958.htm">HERCULES</A></B> 
   - 1958), Mizar's apartment to live in. Barto not only wants to use 
   Jennifer in his ad campaign, he also begins a romantic relationship 
   with her. Barto, who gets queasy at the sight of blood (to put it 
   mildly), isn't quite truthful with Jennifer (he tells her that he's 
   never met Mizar or been in the apartment before, which are both lies) 
   and Adam threatens him with a knife as he leaves the apartment 
   complex, telling him to stay away from Jennifer. That night, the 
   killer (who wears a black stocking mask and a large-brimmed hat) 
   comes into Jennifer's bedroom, but her screams scares the killer 
   away. The next morning, Adam shows up at the apartment and rapes 
   Jennifer, telling her, &quot;From the day of our celestial marriage, 
   you belong to me!&quot; Jennifer can't catch a break, because later 
   that night, the killer is waiting for her in her apartment. The 
   killer attacks her, but she breaks free and runs to the apartment 
   next door, occupied by Shiela (Annabella Incontrera; <B><A HREF="#ClapYoureDead1974">CLAP,
    YOU'RE DEAD</A></B> - 1974) and her elderly violin-playing father 
   (he plays the damn thing all day and night!). When Sheila takes 
   Jennifer back to her own apartment, they find an iris (a flower) 
   covered in blood on the floor and Adam in her bedroom closet, dead 
   with a knife sticking in his stomach. Luckily, Commissioner Enci 
   doesn't believe that Jennifer is the killer. He instead uses her to 
   bait and trap the real killer and tell<A HREF="case_of_the_bloody_iris_1972c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/case of the bloody iris french poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>s
    her not to trust any of her neighbors. But are the neighbors 
   (including a little old woman who loves to read a magazine called 
   &quot;Horror Tales&quot;, who has a hideously-burned son she keeps 
   hidden in a secret room behind her closet) the only people Jennifer 
   shouldn't trust? This early 70's giallo, directed by Giuliano 
   Carnimeo (<B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Exterminators 3000">EXTERMINATORS
    OF THE YEAR 3000</A></B> - 1983; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#rATMAN">THE
    RAT MAN</A></B> - 1988), using his frequent pseudonym &quot;Anthony 
   Ascott&quot;, contains some good set-pieces (including an eerie 
   sequence set in an auto graveyard at night), frequent nudity and some 
   bloody violence. My favorite scene is when Marilyn is stabbed by the 
   killer on a busy street in the middle of the day and she staggers 
   (unnoticed by all the pedestrians) over to a waiting Barto. When he 
   notices all the blood on her hands, he freaks out and runs away, 
   making him look like the guilty party. As with most giallo films, the 
   list of potential suspects and red herrings are many and this film 
   has some memorable ones, each with their own unique quirks. There's 
   also some humor to be found here, most of it coming from Commissioner 
   Enci's second-in-command, Frankie (Franco Agostini; <B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#Face2LeftFeet1979">THE
    FACE WITH TWO LEFT FEET</A></B> - 1979). While staking-out Barto's

   (Cinzia De Carolis; the teenage neighbor who hits on John Saxon in <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Cannibal Apoc">CANNIBAL
    APOCALYPSE</A></B> - 1980!), when he hears a conversation two men

   Lori to look into the car to see if she can identify the men inside 
   it. As they walk away, Lori says there are two men in the car, but 
   she could only get a good look at the man who was talking. Back at 
   home, we discover that Franco creates crossword puzzles for a living 
   (it's quite ingenious the way he does it). As he is creating a new 
   puzzle, he hears a car pull away, but something doesn't sound right. 
   He tries to wake Lori up, but she is sound asleep, so he goes to his 
   terrace and we see that someone has hit a man over the back of his 
   head and he lies unconscious in the street, his attacker standing 
   over him, holding what looks like a billy club. The attacker sees 
   Franco go back into his home and begins to drag the unconscious body 
   away, throwing him in an empty guard station at what looks like a 
   hospital. Does the attacker know that Franco is blind or is he next 
   on the list? What do you think?The attacker (all we see is an extreme 
   close-up of one of his/hers eyes) then sneaks into the hospital, 
   enters an office and opens a cabinet drawer titled 
   &quot;Genetics&quot;. We then discover that the unconscious man is a

   doctors and scientists who are the best in their fields of expertise.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next morning, Franco is walking down the street towards the 
   Institute and hears people talking about the assault last night. A 
   journalist, Carlo Giordani (James Franciscus; <B><A HREF="killer_fish_1979.htm">KILLER
    FISH</A></B> - 1979), bumps into Franco, knocking his cane out of 
   his hand. Carlo apologizes profusely and Franco asks him what has 
   happened. After telling him a guard was assaulted in a failed robbery 
   attempt, Carlo goes inside the Institute and talks to his 
   photographer Righetto (Carlo Alghiero; <B><A HREF="when_women_had_tails_trilogy_1970-1972.htm">WHEN
    WOMEN PLAYED DING DONG</A></B> - 1971), who gives him the skinny on

    WOMAN</A></B> - 1976) and all the other doctors and scientists 
   working there (play close attention to this scene), also telling 
   Carlo that nothing was stolen. Carlo then talks to old friend Police 
   Superintendent Spimi (<A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_3.htm#PierPaoloCapponi">Pier
    Paolo Capponi</A>; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Blood&amp;Diamonds1977">BLOOD
    AND DIAMONDS</A></B> - 1977), who tells him that a thief broke in at 
   10:15 last night and left without taking anything, not a test tube, 
   not an ink bottle, not even a piece of paper, nothing, ending with 
   &quot;Odd, isn't it?&quot; The boss' daughter Anna Terzi (Catherine 
   Spaak; <B><A HREF="take_a_hard_ride_1975.htm">TAKE A HARD RIDE</A></B> 
   - 1975), then enters the building and she and Carlo share a glance at 
   each other, the type of glance that tells us romance is about to 
   bloom, but she keeps on walking. Carlo asks Supt. Spimi what kind of 
   work is done at the Institute and he says genetics, biology and 
   biochemistry. They also do hereditary work, offering &quot;pre-nuptial
    appointments for people with loads of cash who want top-quality 
   offspring. They come in, see a pretty nurse and jack-off. They're 
   told if they have a hereditary disease or if their gun's jammed. They 
   do other research, too. Important top-secret stuff&quot; (everyone 
   should pay close attention to the last sentence in that bit of dialogue).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see that Professor Terzi is having a meeting of the board 
   members when Anna walks in. Terzi tells them to be open, Anna knows 
   everything that goes on in the Institute. He then goes on to say that 
   the research at the Institute has far-reaching implications, 
   therefore, without further tests, it cannot be made public. There 
   could be serious misunderstandings, but since nothing was stolen, 
   nothing needs to be made public. Dr Casoni (Aldo Reggiani; <B><A HREF="sex_machine_1975.htm">THE
    SEX MACHINE</A></B> - 1975) says they can't rule out espionage, the 
   thief may have made copies of documents and put the originals back 
   where they belonged, no one the wiser. Terzi makes it clear to Casoni 
   that he's still in charge of the Institute and he can make decisions 
   without his advice, letting Casoni know who is boss and putting him 
   in his place. Another board member, Dr. Braun (Horst Frank; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#EyeInTheLabyrinth">EYE
    IN THE LABYRINTH</A></B> - 1972), goes as far as to accuse Casoni of 
   being involved with espionage, which he vehemently denies. Dr. Braun 
   then goes on to say he had his staff check all the files and assures 
   everyone that none of the files have been disturbed, as all the 
   cabinets were still locked. Dr. Calabresi (Carlo Alghiero; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Torso1973">TORSO</A></B> 
   - 1973) notices the cabinet drawer marked &quot;Genetics&quot;, the 
   same drawer the thief opened, is unlocked. He makes a phone call to 
   someone, who tells him to keep quiet about it, he/she will see him 
   today at 5:00 pm. Dr. Calabresi doesn't seem too happy about it, but 
   when his girlfriend Bianca (Rada Rassimov; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#StrangersGundown69">THE
    STRANGER'S GUNDOWN</A></B> - 1969) enters his office and sees he is 
   upset, he tells her he doesn't want to talk about it, he will pick 
   her up at her home tonight, go out to dinner and he will tell her 
   everything. Who wants to bet that this is the last time he will ever 
   see Bianca, or anyone else for that matter? One thing he does tell 
   Bianca is that he is the only one who knows what was stolen. And who 
   stole it. Bianca asks him if he is going to tell the police and he 
   says no, he's not telling anyone for the time being. But this could 
   be a huge boost for his career.&nbsp; Now I am certain he will never 
   see daylight again!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Dr. Calabresi then goes to the train station to meet the mysterious 
   person on the phone. Also there are a throng of reporters and 
   photographers, including Righetto, there to meet a young starlet on 
   the next train into the station. As the train approaches, someone 
   wearing black gloves pushes Dr. Calabresi into the path of the 
   incoming train, killing him (a scene cut out of the U.S. theatrical 
   release; It is only implied in that version, but here we see the 
   train hit the doctor as his bloody mangled body rolls onto the 
   platform. When the train stops and the starlet appears, Righetto says 
   under his breath, &quot;Smile bitch, your train has just crushed a 
   guy.&quot;). Righetto doesn't know it, but he has taken a photo that 
   will blow the case wide open. When Franco learns of the doctor's 
   death (Lori tells him that the photo of Dr. Calabresi that Righetto 
   took for the front page of the newspaper is the same person she saw 
   in the car), he goes to Carlo's office and asks him if the photo was 
   cropped. Carlo phones Righetto at home, asks him and he says yes, the 
   photo was cropped and when he looks at the entire photo, he sees 
   something that the viewer isn't privy to. Carlo says he'll be right 
   over to pick up the photo, but he's beaten to it by the killer, who 
   believes the photo may implicate him/her. As Righetto is enlarging 
   the photo, the killer garrotes him with a cord and he suffers a long 
   painful death (the killer also slices Righetto's face with a scalpel 
   as he lies dead on the floor). The killer takes the enlargement and 
   the negative and leaves just seconds before Carlo arrives (Franco and 
   Lori are waiting in the car as the killer walks by them). Carlo goes 
   to see Supt. Spimi and he tells Carlo that the coroner believes 
   Righetto's death was the work of a maniac, but he asks Carlo not to 
   link Calabresi and Righetto's deaths in the newspaper as it might 
   alert the killer. Carlo asks Spimi if he believes it is the work of a 
   maniac and he says he's not sure, he has no clues and doesn't know 
   what to think. He does know that Dr. Calabresi was a bit lifeless and 
   lived alone. Spimi tells Carlo about Calabresi's fianc&eacute; 
   Bianca, so he has a place to start. Carlo, with Franco's help, stakes 
   out the Terzi Institute looking or potential suspects. He notices 
   that Dr. Casoni is particularly chummy with Dr. Mombelli (Emilio 
   Marchesini; Argento's <B><A HREF="five_days_1973.htm">THE FIVE DAYS</A></B> 
   - 1973). When he sees Anna, he tells Franco that she's quite a 
   &quot;peach&quot;. He also notices that the police are following Anna 
   and her father as they leave the Institute together. Carlo and Franco 
   become quick friends and we discover that Franco and Lori are alone 
   in this world (Lori lost her parents in an accident and they are 
   closer than a father and daughter). Franco tells Carlo to talk to 
   Anna because her father is a widower and men who are alone confide 
   with their daughters. While Carlo is talking to her, Franco and Lori 
   go to talk to Bianca. Franco has a hunch and he wants to play it. 
   Carlo notices that Franco is enjoying himself and learns that before 
   he went blind, Franco was a journalist. While Carlo is getting a 
   shave across the street from where Anna and her father live (the 
   barber complains that the reporter in the newspaper Carlo is reading 
   says that the killer could be a crazy barber, not noticing he is 
   shaving the man who wrote it with a very sharp straight razor, making 
   Carlo very nervous!). While Franco and Lori pay Bianca a visit, Carlo 
   muscles his way past Professor Terzi's butler and learns that Dr. 
   Esson (cameo king Tom Felleghy; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Eyeball1975">EYEBALL</A></B> 
   - 1975), another board member, is there. After questioning Terzi and 
   being berated by Dr. Esson, Carlo hears Anna laugh and she tells him 
   that Dr. Esson is in a bad mood because she turned him down to be his 
   lover for the hundredth time. It's obvious that Carlo and Anna have 
   chemistry together and they agree to see each other that night. 
   Franco and Lori leave Bianca's apartment and she apologizes to Franco 
   about being no help, but the look on Franco's face tells a different 
   story. Franco asks Lori what Bianca was playing with around her neck 
   and she says an old watch attached to a chain. The watch had a photo 
   of Dr. Calabresi on one side. As they leave, Bianca makes a phone 
   call, telling the person on the other end that Franco could be trouble.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    That night, Anna takes Carlo for a ride in her sportscar, noticing 
   that the police are following them and driving like a madwoman 
   through the streets of Rome to lose them, which she does. She tells 
   Carlo that the Institute is working on two top-secret projects, one 
   for a revolutionary new drug and one for the government. They had to 
   hire four geneticists because the workload is so intense. The new 
   drug is highly confidential research dealing with the XYY chromosomal 
   variation, which apparently indicates criminal tendencies. She tells 
   Carlo that the drug was used by the government in four trials. She

    This is Dario Argento's second film as a director and while he is 
   still honing his craft, this is a perfectly acceptable giallo flick 
   with excellent<A HREF="cat_o_nine_tails_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cat o' nine tails italy poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="217" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   characters and a twisty mystery. I'm sick of reading that Argento 
   doesn't have a sense of humor, because it is not true at all. 
   Granted, his humor is not of the laugh-out-loud variety, but more 
   black in content, such as Carlo's experience with the barber, who 
   flails his straight razor in Carlo's face, realizing that the barber 
   is talking about him. There's also a contest where a man named Gigi 
   The Loser (Ugo Fangareggi; <B><A HREF="mean_frank_and_crazy_tony_1973.htm">MEAN
    FRANK AND CRAZY TONY</A></B> - 1973) and a priest hurl insults at 
   each other and Gigi wins after saying 137 insults in a row (including 
   &quot;fart ass&quot;, &quot;bed-wetter&quot; and &quot;snot 
   nose&quot;)!&nbsp; Although we now know that having the XYY 
   chromosome does not lead to criminal activity, it serves this film 
   well, giving the killer a reason to commit murder. While the murders 
   aren't that graphic (Dr. Calabresi's murder is the bloodiest), they 
   are hard to watch, especially Bianca's, as she is garroted with a 
   cord and the killer slams her face to the floor over and over. While 
   very light in the nudity department (we get a brief glimpse of Anna's 
   breasts when she makes love to Carlo), this film doesn't need 
   it.&nbsp; It's more about the oddball characters, including Franco. A 
   blind man who creates crossword puzzles? You can't get odder than 
   that. This film may be a bit overlong, but I had a good time with it 
   and you should, too. This is a nice look at how a master of suspense 
   was fine-tuning his craft. Granted, not everything works, but there 
   are more hits than misses, making this film a worthwhile addition to 
   your film library. It's a part of mine.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While Tony and Lisa are enjoying a romantic dinner in his apartment, 
   Tony gets a phone call from his ex-wife Elvi (Gianna Paola Scaffidi; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#BodyPuzzle1992">BODY

   living in (it's hers) and she will find him a new one (she's a 
   realtor). Lisa asks Tony why he is not still married to her (He and 
   Elvi are on very good terms) and Tony says, &quot;Because I wanted a 
   dog.&quot; The next day, when Tony and Elvi are talking in a parking 
   garage, an aviator sunglass-wearing hitman guns them both down, 
   killing Elvi and seriously wounding Tony, the doctors removing a 
   bullet inches away from his heart, putting Tony in a temporary coma. 
   Lisa blames herself, telling the Chief if she didn't fuck up at the 
   restaurant and checked Mancini's body to see if he was really dead, 
   none of this would have happened. The Chief blames himself, telling 
   Lisa he should have known Mancini would retaliate, yet he did nothing 
   to stop it. Tony eventually fully recovers, but he is haunted by 
   memories of Elvi's murder, which puts a strain on his and Lisa's 
   relationship, Tony telling Lisa, &quot;Let me do what I gotta 
   do.&quot; The film then cuts to an insane asylum, where we watch a 
   crazy woman known as &quot;The Countess&quot; (Annie Girardot; <B><A HREF="shock_treatment_1972.htm">SHOCK

    Someone tapes a large envelope to the front door of Tony's 
   apartment, rings the doorbell&nbsp; and quickly scurries away before 
   Tony can see who it is. The envelope is addressed to Elvi and inside 
   it are photos of a very old house. Tony finds the phone number of a 
   photo processing business on the back of one of the photos and calls 
   it; the person on the other end admitting to sending a messenger to 
   deliver the photos to Elvi, as she told them the photos were very 
   important to her. Tony doesn't know it yet, but it was Elvi who was 
   targeted in the parking garage, not him, and the photos will lead 
   Tony to unravel a mystery so deep, it will expose the person who 
   hired the hitman to kill his ex-wife, as well leading him to uncover 
   the identity of a serial killer the press have named &quot;The Full 
   Moon Killer.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Tony has the Forensics Department blow up the photographs and one 
   photo reveals what looks like a person looking out of one of the 
   house's windows. Tony asks if the photo can be enlarged more to 
   reveal the identity of the person looking out of the window, only to 
   be told that's the best they can do...for the moment. Tony then goes 
   to the old house to investigate further, only to find it abandoned 
   and all the rooms empty, no furniture, no paintings, nothing, except 
   for a dead human body in the house's kitchen, kneeling with its face 
   in the oven! Tony finds the corpse's wallet&nbsp; and comes up with a 
   name (which we are not told...yet). The police then search inside and 
   outside the house looking for clues, while the pathologist, George 
   (Bobby Rhodes; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#LastHunter1980">THE LAST HUNTER</A></B> 
   - 1980), says that the body was mummified and probably died from gas 
   poisoning. Judging by the state of the corpse's clothes, death 
   occurred four to five years ago. The body is that of a male, age 
   about thirty. Tony is old friends with George, telling him that 
   someone involved with this house murdered his ex-wife. George is 
   shocked to hear that Elvi is dead and offers his condolences. He 
   tells Tony he will call him first with the results of the autopsy, as 
   it may be important to find Elvi's killer. Lisa tells Tony that, 
   according to documents found in the wallet, the corpse's first name 
   is &quot;Marco&quot; and his last name begins with &quot;B-e-a&quot;, 
   but the rest is unreadable. Tony tells Lisa that he believes the 
   corpse is why Elvi was murdered, but Lisa says that's nonsense, she 
   still believes Mancini was involved in his ex-wife's death. Tony 
   believes the Mancini case and Elvi's murder are two separate 
   incidents, saying the killer saw Elvi taking photos of the house and 
   thought she saw the dead body, so he killed her, but Lisa stands pat 
   in her belief that Mancini and only Mancini is responsible. So, who 
   is right here? Is it a case of Elvi being in the wrong place at the 
   wrong time or is Mancini guilty of hiring a hitman to kill Tony and 
   Elvi just got in the way? I'm afraid I am going to have to side with 
   Tony. This is a giallo film, after all.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Chief chews-out Tony, asking him why he was at that house. Tony 
   says he wanted to find out who murdered Elvi, but before he can say 
   any more the Chief interrupts and says it was Mancini who killed his 
   ex-wife, telling Tony he is no longer a homicide detective, he now 
   works in the narcotics division and to leave Elvi's murder to the 
   homicide department, saying finding that dead body was nothing but a 
   coincidence. Tony says there are too many coincidences here, for if a 
   professional hitman was hired to kill him, why did he shoot Elvi 
   first? A professional hitman doesn't miss his target, especially the 
   short distance away he was from him and Elvi (he does have a point!). 
   The Chief orders Tony to take a vacation and leave Mancini to 
   homicide, but Tony says he'll get Mancini, just not for Elvi's 
   murder. A female detective then gives Tony the address of a 
   red-headed female lawyer named Paula (Carla Cassola; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Sect1991">THE
    SECT</A></B> - 1991), as she handled the sale of that house. Paula 
   tells Tony that a French millionairess owns the building and it is 
   only a small part of her vast fortune. Her last name is 
   &quot;Beaumon&quot;, but she likes to be called &quot;The 
   Countess&quot;. That's right, the same crazy lady we saw stab the 
   hand of an orderly with a pencil at the loony bin. According to 
   Paula, The Countess has no family, although there was talk that she 
   had a son, but she was unable to verify that. We then see The 
   Countess in her room, painting a strange mural on one of the walls 
   (Freeze the film and study that mural carefully, as it contains a vey 
   important clue!). The Countess' doctor tells Tony that she is very 
   unsociable and possibly won't answer any of his questions. She is 
   also very dangerous; she was committed to the asylum for murdering 
   her husband and mutilating him beyond recognition. No one is allowed 
   to be in the same room with her, not even nurses or interns, because 
   she is very dangerous (She is treated like Hannibal Lecter in <B><A HREF="silence_of_the_lambs_1991.htm">SILENCE
    OF THE LAMBS</A></B> [1991}, as one wall of her room is made of 
   unbreakable glass and she has to put her arm through a hole in the 
   glass to get her daily injection of meds). The doctor tells Tony to 
   stand in the center of the adjoining room when talking to her and 
   never to get close to the glass; don't give her anything and don't 
   take anything she offers him, because it may be the last thing he 
   ever does. Tony then talks to The Countess through the glass, but her 
   room is pitch black. To get a rise out of her, Tony tells The 
   Countess that he has some important information about her son. The 
   lights come on in her room and The Countess tells Tony that her son 
   Marco was a bitter disappointment to her, as he caused her&nbsp; so 
   much grief and so much pain. he stole her looks and her youth and he 
   is the reason she's locked up in this asylum. As a child, Marco would 
   play the most horrible jokes on her, yet she still loved him as a 
   mother. Marco was &quot;a little shit&quot;, yet it was all her 
   husband's fault, as his only love was for dogs; he lived for them, 
   ignoring and neglecting his family, which is why she butchered him. 
   Tony then says he has some bad news for her, Marco committed suicide. 
   Instead of being upset, The Countess looks at Tony and says, 
   &quot;Recently there's been a tragedy in your life, isn't there? It's 
   in your eyes. It means we have something in common.&quot; She then 
   walks away, turns out the lights and puts on a classical music CD, 
   mumbling that she won an auction for a tea set, even out-bidding 
   Queen Elizabeth for it, proving to Tony that she is crazy as a loon, 
   but was all that real or just a show?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At a bowling alley (Why do many Italian genre films have bowling 
   scenes in them? What is their fascination with bowling?), the Chief 
   asks Tony if he remembers the serial killer known as &quot;The Full 
   Moon Killer&quot;? Tony says yes, he murdered several women before he 
   disappeared into thin air and all his victims had red hair.&nbsp; The 
   Chief, who once worked on the case before it turned cold, says, 
   &quot;His modus operendi never varied, he stabbed his victims to 
   death and then decapitated them.&quot; The Chief believes that Marco 
   was The Full Moon Killer, as the murders stopped five years ago, the 
   same time Marco committed suicide.&nbsp; Tony says the murders also 
   stopped the same time Marco's mother was committed to the asylum. The 
   Chief then tells Tony that there's one more bit of information he 
   needs to know, something that makes nonsense of what they just said. 
   A search of the house where Marco killed himself revealed a pistol 
   and ballistics proved that it is the same gun that killed Elvi. This 
   throws a monkey wrench into Tony's beliefs, but the Chief tells him 
   to concentrate on Mancini because the heroin Tony snatched from him 
   was 100% pure and a consignment that big puts Mancini in deep trouble 
   with the Mob. If Tony busts Mancini, he could also dismantle the 
   entire crime syndicate for good (In other words, Mancini is scared 
   for his life and will probably name names, like Mafia turncoat Sammy 
   &quot;The Bull&quot; Gravano [Google him]). Meanwhile, Mancini is on 
   the phone with his boss, who tells Mancini to kill Tony and find out 
   where the police are storing the heroin. The boss then hangs up the 
   phone on Mancini mid-sentence and Mancini tries to save face with his 
   girlfriend by yelling &quot;You go to Hell!&quot; into the receiver.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Tony takes Lisa to a fancy restaurant, when a car drives through the 
   front window and Mancini's goons try to gun down Tony. Lisa, who was 
   on a bathroom break, suddenly appears with gun drawn and two of the 
   goons escape in the car in a volley of bullets. This is not going to 
   go over well with Mancini's boss, as Tony and Lisa are unhurt. Tony 
   and Lisa then share a pizza at Lisa's apartment and Tony tells her 
   that he doesn't think Marco was The Full Moon Killer. So who is? If 
   you want to know, I'm afraid you are going to have to watch the film, 
   but I will tell you this: George tells Tony that the corpse he found 
   in the house wasn't Marco at all; as a matter of fact, the body is 
   the wrong sex! That's right, it's the body of a woman with red hair. 
   And to pile on the problems, women with red hair are suddenly being 
   murdered again in the same way as The Full Moon Killer. And to add 
   injury to insult, The Countess has escaped from the asylum and she's 
   currently in Lisa's apartment (Did I mention that both Lisa and The 
   Countess have red hair?). Is The Countess The Full Moon Killer or is 
   that all too easy? The Full Moon Killer is revealed when George comes 
   up with a name for the female corpse. The problem is, Tony sent Lisa 
   to protect the person who is now using the corpse's name<A HREF="circle_of_fear_1992.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/circle of fear italy poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="307" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   (Plastic surgery was involved). The only question that remains is 
   this: Will Tony check on The Full Moon Killer's body to make sure it 
   is really dead?&nbsp; All the clues are in this review, so grab your

    This late-in-the-game giallo film, an Italy/France co-production, is 
   actually very good, but I expect nothing less from director Aldo 
   Lado, who uses his &quot;George B. Lewis&quot; pseudonym here.&nbsp; 
   Lado has given us such good films as the gialli <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#ShortNightDolls1971">SHORT

   - 1977) and Robert Brodie Booth (<B><A HREF="uppercut_man_1988.htm">UPPERCUT
    MAN</A></B> - 1988), manages to hit the right notes most of the 
   time, except for Burt Young, who is basically wasted in his role as 
   Mancini (I also had a problem with George being a lousy pathologist, 
   not noticing on first inspection that the body was female instead of 
   male, but I chalk that up to being a last minute plot twist). Be 
   aware that this is a story-driven film that lacks any extreme blood 
   and gore and very little female nudity, which is a shame since Kay 
   Sandvik (real name: Kay Rush) has a very nice body. It's great to see 
   Philippe Leroy in a '90s production, as I have seen many of his '60s 
   &amp; '70s films (such as <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CastleLivDead1964">CASTLE
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> [1964] and <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#CrossCurrent">CROSS
    CURRENT</A></B> [1971]) and he always turns in a good performance. 
   While most genre films from Italy in the '90s were frequently 
   sub-par, this is not one of them. It's a fairly involving giallo 
   thanks to good writing and Aldo Lado's tight direction. It may not 
   compare to most '70s giallo films, but what does?&nbsp; Just sit back

   turns her anger to screenwriter Ross (Carlo Enrici; <B><A HREF="giant_of_metropolis_1961.htm">THE
    GIANT OF METROPOLIS</A></B> - 1961), telling Benner she won't work 
   as long as he is on the set. She storms into her trailer while Ross 
   calls her a whore, accusing her of sleeping with everyone (It's 
   obvious they have had a bad romantic relationship). Ross<A HREF="clap_youre_dead_1974.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/clap you're dead poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   then turns his anger towards Benner, ripping pages out of his 
   screenplay and accusing him of cutting costs, saying he doesn't know 
   why he writes such golden words when it is obvious Benner was never 
   going to use them, then storming off the set as Benner insults him 
   and calls him names. A short time later, Linda is found dead in a car 
   while filming a scene at the car wash, her throat cut. Is it possible 
   Benner filmed the killer?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    That's what Inspector Menzel (George Ardisson; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#HumanCobras1971">HUMAN
    COBRAS</A></B> - 1971) and his partner, Sgt. Bert Malden (Renzo 
   Ozzano; <B><A HREF="black_turin_1972.htm">BLACK TURIN</A></B> - 
   1972), who were just put on the case, want to know, so Benner shows 
   them the footage and notices a shadow that shouldn't be there, 
   telling Menzel and Bert, &quot;That's not how we would light an 
   actor.&quot; Since it is just a shadow, the killer cannot be 
   identified, but Menzel is certain that the killer was in the car with 
   Linda and escaped later. Menzel asks Benner who could have seen the 
   screenplay to know that Linda was supposed to be alone in the scene 
   and Benner tells him even he doesn't know what was written in the 
   screenplay until he starts filming the scene (&quot;Stories I know 
   well, but only when I'm filming.&quot;). Benner knows scripter Ross 
   and Linda had a contemptuous relationship, but doesn't mention it to 
   the Inspector, instead telling him to talk to Richard Hanson (Ivano 
   Staccioli; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Devil7Faces1971">THE DEVIL WITH 
   SEVEN FACES</A></B> - 1971) an electrician Linda hired and then fired 
   just before she was murdered.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When Menzel and Bert make it to Hanson's apartment, he is not there, 
   only Hanson's elderly wheelchair-bound father (We first spot the old 
   man using binoculars to spy on a naked female in another buliding 
   taking a sink bath!). He tells Menzel and Bert that Richard is never 
   here, he spends all the money he has on whores and booze. The old man 
   begins weeping crocodile tears, saying his son never thinks about him 
   and then asks Menzel if he has any children (Menzel doesn't answer). 
   The old man calls Menzel &quot;respectable&quot; when he hands him 
   some cash and tells him&nbsp; that Richard spends most of his time at 
   &quot;La Cora&quot;, a bar/motel around the corner where whores and 
   loose women hang out. At La Cora, an elderly woman points the way to 
   the crime-fighting duo to a room where Richard can be found, but 
   warns them he is probably not alone. She's right, as we see Richard 
   screwing a woman named Rosie on a bed. Richard tells the Inspector 
   that he had nothing to do wityh Linda's murder and when asked if he 
   was fired for hitting on Linda, Richard responds with, &quot;Who 
   didn't have it with her?&quot;, implying that she was a slut. It 
   turns out Richard has an alibi, as Rosie tells Menzel and Bert that 
   Richard was with her immediately after Linda fired him, but is she 
   telling the truth?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At his office, Menzel gets a phone call from Mary (Thea Fleming; <B><A HREF="killer_lacks_a_name_1966.htm">THE
    KILLER LACKS A NAME</A></B> - 1966), another actress on Benner's 
   film. She tells him that she and actress Fanny (Belinda Bron) were 
   sitting near the camera while Linda was shooting her last scene and 
   she and Fanny saw a shadow. Mary tells the Inspector to meet her a 
   Benner's villa tonight, he's throwing a party and everyone involved 
   with the film will be there. She also tells him what she has to say 
   is very important (A giallo trope. Why cant she just tell him over 
   the phone?). Menzel doesn't want to wait that long, so Mary tells him 
   to meet her at the set of a scene she is going to be in at a quarry 
   today. That day, while a naked Mary is filming her scene in the 
   quarry, where she is tied to a stake and is to be burned for being a 
   witch, Mary walks off the set and into her trailer, yelling to Benner 
   that she refuses to do the scene unless he changes it. Ross tells 
   Benner that he wrote the scene where Mary drowns in a pool, but 
   Benner says, &quot;She'll die like Joan Of Arc. It's much better! 
   Have you no imagination?&quot; The killer then walks into Mary's 
   trailer (Mary says, &quot;Oh, it's you.&quot;, but we never see the 
   killer's face, just the tan rubber gloves he is wearing) and 
   strangles her with a piece of electrical wire. Menzel shows up and 
   wants to speak to Mary immediately, only to find her dead in her 
   trailer, the electrical wire still wrapped around her neck. Everyone 
   at the quarry is questioned, but they all have rock solid alibis. 
   There are also no fingerprints on the electrical wire thanks to the 
   killer wearing gloves (At least they weren't black gloves, which are 
   the usual hand gear used in most giallo flicks!), so the Inspector is 
   no closer to finding the killer. Bert mentions that Richard Hanson 
   nis an electrician, so Menzel tells him to have Hanson followed, even 
   though he thinks he is not the killer.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That night, Menzel and Bert show up at Benner's party, where Menzel 
   talks to Ross and learns he has been Benner's screenwriter for years, 
   which is why he puts up with Benner's constant insults (He also 
   doesn't want to lose his job). Menzel then talks to Fanny (who is 
   barely dressed) and tells her she is the only person alive who has 
   seen the killer. Fanny couldn't be more disinterested, saying all she 
   saw was a shadow and walks out of the room (Fanny then strips down to 
   a barely-there bikini and dances provacatively to some funky 
   instrumental music in front of everyone, nearly impaling her ass on 
   some sharp spikes on one of Benner's sculptures!). Meanwhile, Bert 
   sees a man he thinks he knows from somewhere, but the man tells him 
   he must be mistaken and nervously walks away. Bert then catches 
   Menzel kissing Lucia (Annabella Incontrera; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CaseOfTheBloodyIris">THE
    CASE OF THE BLOODY IRIS</A></B> - 1971), who is working as a Script 
   Woman on Benner's film, on a stone spiral staircase that leads to the 
   roof and Menzel tells Bert to stay at Benner's house tonight and to 
   keep his eyes open, but, a few moments later, Bert doesn't see the 
   killer trying to murder a naked Fanny while she is taking a shower, 
   bashing her head in over and over on a faucet handle. Fanny is not 
   quite dead, so she is rushed to the hospital in critical condition. 
   Menzel assigns a cop to stand guard over Fanny's hospital room, but 
   the killer distracts the cop&nbsp; with the old &quot;phony phone 
   call&quot; trick, enters Fanny's room, disconnects the hose that is 
   keeping her breathing, which kills her.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Richard Hanson becomes suspect number one, since he was caught 
   lurking around Benner's house at the time of Fanny's attack. This 
   leads to a fairly long chase through the catacombs of the sewer 
   system that leads to the river, where Hanson successfully escapes by 
   swimming to the other side. We all know Hanson is a red herring, 
   because he couldn't look guiltier if he tried. Can Manzel solve this 
   before the Prosecutor pulls him off the case? The killer's identity 
   is revealed when Benner is filming the final scene of his movie 
   (which looks like a bastardization of <B><A HREF="danger_diabolik_1968.htm">DANGER:
    DIABOLIK</A></B> [1968]), as everyone, even Benner, are wearing 
   masks so they are hard to identify and, of course, Hanson is also 
   there. So who is the killer and what is his motive? As you well know, 
   I never give the killer's identity away, but the clues are in this 
   review, so put on your thinking caps and concentrate real hard (Not 
   too hard because it will give you a brain aneurysm when you discover 
   who it is!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

   entertaining giallo flick that will not disappoint fans of female 
   nudity and mystery genres. It's not one of the best, but it will do 
   for the time being. There is one thing I do have to say: I don't know 
   what film Benner was making, but I would love to see it. It seems 
   like a parody of horror films, before horror film parodies were a

   YouTube, where channel &quot;Giallo Realm&quot; shows an uncut print 
   in widescreen with English subtitles. My advice is to watch this film 
   as soon as possible, because Giallo Realm is known for being put in 
   &quot;YouTube Jail&quot; or having their channel deleted for 
   copyright and license infringement many times in the past couple of 
   years. My question is this: Why do Italian production companies 
   complain about their movies being streamed in the U.S. when many of 
   them haven't been given a proper release here (at least not yet)? It 
   seems kind of childish to punish someone for streaming a movie no one 
   has ever heard of here. When they do get to releasing these films 
   properly streaming or on disc in the United States, then they can 
   warn the YouTube channels to remove the film from their channel. 
   Otherwise, YouTube is much too quick to punish these channels, as 
   they don't investigate the complaints at all, they rather delete the 
   entire channel than deleting a single film from it. That's just 
   idiotic. This film is <B>Not Rated</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

   - 1983). Everyone believes she has committed herself to deal with 
   Paul's suicide and only Dr. Quilly (who uses very unorthodox methods 
   to treat his patients) can release her. After finding all her clothes 
   ripped to shreds (everyone thinks she did it), Susan is forced to 
   wear a nurse's uniform. She meets a patient named David (Greg 
   Latter), who is kept locked in a padded cell. He tells Susan that 
   nurses end up dead at The Institute and then tries to strangle her 
   for not bringing him candy. Another patient named Ronnie (<B><A HREF="welcome_back_kotter_tv_series_1975-1979.htm">WELCOME

   - 1972; <B><A HREF="hellgate_1989.htm">HELLGATE</A></B> - 1989, also 
   starring Palillo), contains a better-than-average cast for a film of 
   this type and has a screenplay (by Simon Last and Paul Mason) that 
   keeps you guessing right up to the very end. The lovely Jennifer 
   O'Neill (who has a semi-nude bath scene) is simply wonderful here as 
   a woman who may or may not be one sandwich short of a picnic. As the 
   patients begin dying or disappearing and she can't get anyone to 
   believe her story (she's nearly raped by a patient pretending to be a 
   hospital guard, played with sweaty persistence by Sydney Lassick [<B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Sonny Boy">SONNY
    BOY</A></B> - 1989]), O'Neill manages to keep the viewers' 
   sympathies, whether crazy or not. The violence in this film is rather 
   subdued and bloodless, but the storyline doesn't call for blood or 
   gore. Instead, it relies on mystery and suspense and <B><A HREF="committed_1988b.htm">COMMITTED</A></B> 
   offers several tense scenes, including David's unexpected visit to 
   Susan's bedroom and Susan's exploration of The Institute's basement, 
   where she makes some eye-opening discoveries. If you like your films 
   more cerebral than the average stalk 'n' slasher, this film should be 
   your cup of tea. The finale contains so many twists, you'll swear it 
   was made at a Bavarian pretzel factory. It's definitely the best film 
   on William A. Levey's resume. Made in 1988, but not released until 
   1990. Famed late film cutter Fima Novek was called in to rescue the 
   film in post-production when producer Alan Amiel determined the film 
   to be unreleasable in it's original form. Novek not only received the 
   Editor credit, he also received a &quot;Music Adaptor&quot; credit

    is gone and all we see is a woman in a white hooded robe exiting the

   &quot;Eye of Horus&quot;) that she wears around her neck. While Peter 
   is at the bar, he receives a letter from his fiancee Paola (Isabelle 
   Marchall). Peter's butler, Burton (Unberto Raho), reads the letter to 
   him, telling Peter that Paola is leaving him (Sending a &quot;Dear 
   John&quot; letter to a blind man. How despicable!). The mysterious 
   woman in white goes to a fashion institute carrying a basket (looking 
   like some sinister Little Red Riding Hood) and enters a room with a 
   big &quot;F&quot; and &quot;3&quot; on the door. We then find out 
   that the institute is owned by Victor Morgan (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart of <B><A HREF="war_between_the_planets_1966.htm">WAR
    BETWEEN THE PLANETS</A></B> [1966]), whom the female employees swoon 
   over, but the real businessperson is Francoise Ballais (Sylvia 
   Koscina), who runs the institute's day-to-day operations. Victor and 
   Francoise are also married, but there's trouble in paradise as 
   Francoise thinks that Victor is fooling around with Paola, Peter's 
   ex. Paola, who is a model at the institute, goes into room F3 to 
   change. She finds a yellow shawl with a note attached to it on the 
   table. She reads the note, burns it, puts on the yellow shawl and 
   notices the basket on the floor. She opens the basket, screams and 
   then drops dead, her yellow shawl ripped and scratches on her neck. 
   By the time the police are called in, the basket has disappeared. The 
   police inspector, Jansen (Renato De Carmine), believes Paola was 
   murdered, so institute employee Margot (Shirley Corrigan) brings 
   Inspector Jansen to Peter's house to break the news to him. Peter 
   mentions the Dear John letter to Jansen (but he doesn't ask to see

    to solve these murders? Who is making the woman in white carry out 
   these murders and what are his/her motivations for doing so? I've

   mention of yellow shawls (the film's original title is <B>SETTE 
   SCIALLI DI</B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"> </FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B>SETA
    GIALLA</B>, which translates to &quot;Seven Shawls Of Yellow 
   Silk&quot;), you can probably guess that this is an Italian giallo 
   film (the killer even drives a yellow VW Beetle!), and a good one at 
   that. Director/co-scripter Sergio Pastore builds the mystery slowly, 
   introducing characters as suspects and red herrings while giving us 
   small pieces of Peter's personal life. In the beginning, we hear a 
   waiter call him &quot;Maestro&quot;, so we get the sense that he's 
   some kind of musician. It's not until much later in the film that we 
   find out what type of musician he really is: He's a film composer! A 
   blind film composer (think about that for a minute). It's not the 
   first time that a blind man was a central character in a giallo. Karl 
   Malden was a blind man in Dario Argento's <B><A HREF="#CatONineTails1971">CAT
    O' NINE TAILS</A></B> (1971) and, just like that film, there's a 
   murder in a subway station and it takes a blind man to see the truth. 
   The killing method is quite unique, as the yellow shawls are coated 
   with the deadly poison curare and a cat pheremone and when a cat is 
   unleashed from the basket, it scratches the person through the shawl, 
   releasing the poison into their system and killing them instantly. 
   There are also other methods of death, including hanging, stabbing, a 
   cat beheaded under the wheels of a subway car and a real nasty 
   slashing in the shower (that comes out of nowhere and is extremely 
   graphic for it's time). There's also nudity (including a lesbian 
   scene), drug use, circus clown flashbacks (fucking scary stuff!) and 
   plenty of wild 70's fashions. <B><A HREF="crimes_of_the_black_cat_1972b.htm">CRIMES
    OF THE BLACK CAT</A></B> is a compelling murder mystery that will 
   have you guessing up to the very end, where the killer takes Peter to 
   a glassworks and leaves him there to fend for himself, broken glass 
   littering the floor and dangerous machinery operating around him.

   vat of lye and a final murder that's as gory as it is shocking. It's

   father is decapitated by the blade of a bulldozer), the police 
   discover that the little boy has been dead for at least two days. His 
   small body has been gutted and his internal organs replaced with 
   canisters of heroin! The police are reasonably upset that the body of 
   a young child was being used as a drug mule, but more upset are the 
   Dons of the local Mafia. They hold a meeting to discuss the matter 
   and come to the conclusion that Don Ricuzzo Cantimo (Fausto Tozzi), 
   nicknamed &quot;The Americano&quot; because he was deported from 
   Brooklyn, is to blame for this despicable incident. The Mafia assigns 
   Don Casscemi (Vittorio Sanipoli) to deal with Don Ricuzzo (in other 
   words, dispose of him). After leaving the meeting, Don Casscemi is 
   kidnapped by some of Don Ricuzzo's men, but his captors are surprised 
   and shot dead (with a bullet each between the eyes) by whistling 
   hitman Tony Aniante (Henry Silva), Don Casscemi's number one 
   assassin. Don Casscemi then tells Tony to kill anyone involved with 
   the dead boy <A HREF="cry_of_a_prostitute_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cry of a prostitute poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="321" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>incident,
    including Don Ricuzzo. From the moment Tony arrives in Don Ricuzzo's 
   village, the bloodshed and treachery begins. When he stops a robbery 
   of some of Don Turi's (Mario Landi) heroin, Tony begins to play the 
   two local Dons against each other. He lets them believe that he is 
   working as an enforcer for both of them, but Tony has a deep (and as 
   of yet, unknown) personal vendetta to resolve. Tony doesn't even mind 
   using Don Ricuzzo's American whore wife, Margie (Barbara Bouchet, who 
   Tony first spots bathing with some freshly-squeezed milk) to achieve 
   his goals. As the attacks against the two Dons escalate, including a 
   failed attempt to kidnap Don Turi's retarded grandson Zino (Alfredo 
   Pea), we learn the real reason why Tony is holding such a huge chip 
   on his shoulder. The finale finds Tony being found out (he really is 
   quite the bastard) and, even though he is beaten to a pulp and left 
   for dead, he works out one final deal to kill Don Ricuzzo. Be 
   prepared for a twist at the end. It's a keeper.&nbsp; This is a 
   terrific example of the Italian crime thriller genre that came into 
   prominence during the 70's and no one was better in them than Henry 
   Silva (<B><A HREF="action.htm#Almost Human">ALMOST HUMAN</A></B> - 
   1974). With his steely eyes (that could melt glass) and no-nonsense 
   attitude, Silva makes the perfect anti-hero. As the take-no-prisoners 
   Tony, who announces himself to his enemies by whistling a haunting 
   tune just before putting a bullet in the middle of their foreheads, 
   Silva is one mean motherfucker. Not only does he kill two guys with 
   bullets in their brainpans in one sequence that takes place in a 
   quarry, he then runs over their bodies with a steamroller and 
   flattens them like a pancake! The strangest scene (and probably where 
   they came up with the film's misleading title) is where Margie 
   corners Tony in the kitchen late one night and threatens to scream 
   rape unless Tony makes love to her. He calls her a &quot;whore&quot; 
   (she was one in America before Don Ricuzzo married her) and she 
   replies, &quot;Three bucks a pop and two bucks for a handjob...in a 
   car!&quot;. What happens next is completely insane. Margie says to 
   Tony, &quot;We're all whores in this world. The only difference is 
   that you don't sell your body. You sell your soul!&quot; She spits on 
   him and Tony then anally rapes her while she screams in pleasure and 
   pain! Later on, he whips her with his belt (even using the buckle at 
   one point!) and rapes her again on some hay in a barn, leaving her a 
   bloody, bruised mess. You gotta love those Italians. There's also an 
   excellent shootout/massacre at Don Turi's villa where people are 
   shotgunned in the head and gut and Don Turi's wife, Santa (Dada 
   Gallotti of <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#GirlInRoom2A">GIRL IN 
   ROOM 2A</A></B> - 1973) cleaves a man's head in two with a bandsaw! 
   As you can tell, this is an extremely violent film that doesn't pull 
   it's punches. Director Andrea Bianchi (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#StripNudeKiller">STRIP
    NUDE FOR YOUR KILLER</A></B> - 1975; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BurialGround1980">BURIAL

   - 1987) fills the screen with gruesome sights, from the opening views 
   of the father's decapitation and little boy's autopsy, multiple 
   bloody shootouts, dismemberments, rapes and stabbings. The film is 
   almost Shakespearian in it's tragedy, especially when retarded Zino 
   is handed a gun and told to get revenge since he is the last 
   surviving male member of Don Turi's family. This film is also full of 
   quotable dialogue (none of it unintentionally funny), scripted by 
   Piero Piegnoli. Here's my favorite: <B><I>Don Ricuzzo</I></B></FONT></FONT><B><I><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">:</FONT></FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"> <I>&quot;Do

   (both 2006), are the dregs of filmmaking, made by a man who must have 
   contempt for his audience, because all these films have a look and 
   feel like they were made in someone's backyard and home over a 
   booze-and-cocaine-fueled weekend. I picked <B>CURSE OF THE ZODIAC</B> 
   to review because it sits in the middle of Lommel's serial killer 
   series (he's still churning them out as of late 2009) and is 
   representative of his entire oeuvre. Shit comes in many shapes and 
   shades of brown, but they all stink nonetheless. <B>CURSE</B> begins 
   with the Zodiac (Jack Quinn; but voiced by Lommel himself using the 
   pseudonym &quot;Rick Van Cleef&quot;) taunting a writer (Jon E. 
   Nemitz) over the phone with insults like, &quot;Hey fat fuck, I'm 
   gonna kill a prostitute tonight!&quot; while headache-inducing fast 
   editing and annoying in-camera effects fill the screen (Lommel thinks 
   that all it takes to be a good director is to have a DV camera with 
   lots of buttons on it). The Zodiac kills the prostitute, but Natasha 
   Baines (Cassandra Church, who must have learned how to act from the 
   back of a Cracker Jack box) has some psychic link to him and 
   &quot;sees&quot; all of his murders while they are happening. When 
   she tries to explain her &quot;gift&quot; to her boyfriend (Lee 
   Mercer), he complains that he is running out of wine, tells her to ge 
   see a psychiatrist and then nearly breaks up with her. She goes to 
   the police, who are no help, but she meets the writer and they join 
   forces to try to bring the Zodiac down. When Natasha's boyfriend 
   learns of her new partner in crime-solving, he becomes jealous and 
   then really does break up with her! The rest of the film is nothing 
   but endless monologues by the Zodiac (who likes to repeat the words 
   &quot;fat fuck&quot;, &quot;pretty girl&quot;, &quot;cock&quot; and 
   &quot;cunt&quot; over and over), while Natasha and the writer try to 
   identify him. I don't know about you, but I'm rooting for the 
   Zodiac!&nbsp; Quite simply, this film is a painful endurance test for 
   even the most patient viewers, as the film contains non-stop flashy 
   editing guaranteed to give epileptics grand maul seizures, inane 
   dialogue scenes (much of it seems improvised), acting that would be 
   booed offstage at a grade school play, violence that is nothing more 
   than splashing blood and chopped meat on victims and walls, and 
   handheld camera that never stop moving, inducing what amounts to 
   seasickness on dry land. Lommel does try to place the film in the 
   70's, as the clothing and hairstyles are appropriate, but 
   anachronisms abound, especially cars on the street that are of much 
   more modern vintage. I can't think of one good thing to say about 
   this film and, if there is an afterlife, I hope Ulli Lommel is forced 
   to watch all these films on a never-ending loop while buried up to 
   his lower lip in sewage in the bottom level of Hell. Are you 
   listening, God? It's me, Fred. Also starring Victoria Ullmann, Lyn 
   Beausoleil, Colette Claire, Trevor Parsons, Shaun Adams, Pia Pownall

   (2002) -</B> In this uncertain world we live in, filled with school 
   shootings and unnecessary wars. it's sometimes wise to search for 
   answers as to why people enjoy killing other people. Serial killers 
   always facinated me, especially the reasons why they kill. Most of 
   them had abusive parents, were sexually assaulted as children and are 
   very intelligent. And it takes a long time to catch them. In my 
   search for answers, this film, which takes many liberties with 
   Jeffrey Dahmer's story, was not the place to look for them. The film 
   opens with Dahmer (Jeremy Renner of <B><A HREF="28_weeks_later_2007.htm">28
    WEEKS LATER</A></B> [2007]) picking up an Asian boy at a shoe store 
   after buying him an expensive pair of sneakers in return for posing <A HREF="dahmer_2002.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dahmer dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="212" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>for
    a couple of Polaroids back at Dahmer's house. Once at the house, 
   Dahmer drugs the kid's drink and, once the kid passes out, takes many 
   photos, kisses the kid and then drills a small hole in his head, 
   giving him a homemade lobotomy. The police show their ignorance when 
   the kid escapes and Dahmer convinces them that the kid is drunk, so 
   the cops escort the kid back to the house (this part is based on 
   fact). Flashbacks reveal that Dahmer's father, Lionel (Bruce 
   Davison), was overbearing and had trust issues with Jeffrey (the 
   scene between the two arguing over a locked box in Jeffrey's closet 
   is a study in tension, as we don't know what's in the box until he 
   opens it [it's a human head!]). In another flashback, we spot Jeffrey 
   going to a gay bar and drugging a series of men's drinks over the 
   course of a few months, having sex with their motionless bodies until 
   one day a bartender catches him spiking a drink and has the bouncers 
   beat him up and throw him out permanently. Back in the present, 
   Dahmer picks up a young black man at a sporting goods store and 
   brings him home. As they are talking about sex with women, it 
   triggers a flashback which shows us why he detests straight sex, 
   which dates back to high school. His first gay experience was when, 
   as a student, he gets a high school wrestler high, brings him back to 
   his parent's house where they get into an impromptu wrestling match 
   and it turns him on. It also turns out to be his first kill. Back in 
   the present, the young black kid, though drugged, manages to escape 
   but returns when he misses the last bus home. This makes him Dahmer's 
   last victim, as it would also be Dahmer's last day of freedom. The 
   film ends as it began: Jeffrey alone and not certain about his 
   future.&nbsp; For a serial killer flick, <B><A HREF="dahmer_2002b.htm">DAHMER</A></B> 
   is almost bloodless and the violence is kept to a minimum. That's not 
   to say it's not an uncomfortable film to watch. The threat of 
   violence is in almost every frame as we begin to realize that Jeffrey 
   may like committing violence, but when the tables are turned on him, 
   he folds like a bad hand of cards. For the most part, the violence is 
   implied, although some scenes, such as when Jeffrey dismembers his 
   first victim on his parents' kitchen floor, are still hard to watch. 
   We know what he's doing (thanks to some eerie sound effects), we just 
   can't see it. On the negative side, let's just say it's not going to 
   change the mind of anyone who thinks that homosexuality is immoral. 
   Director/writer David Jacobson portrays the gay lifestyle rather 
   grittily, subjecting the scenes to red filters as if he was equating 
   gay sex with violence and bloodshed. This is basically the story 
   about Dahmer's last day of freedom, with flashbacks filling in some 
   turning points in his life. The way the story is told, you are never 
   aware or shown any of his other numerous victims and, except for a 
   crawl in the beginning (which says he was convicted of 15 counts of 
   murder), this film takes for granted that you know Dahmer's history. 
   This is the most un-serial killer film about a serial killer that you 
   are likely to see. If you're looking for something along the lines of <B><A HREF="henry_portrait_of_a_serial_killer.htm">HENRY,
    PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER</A></B> (1986), you will be bitterly 
   disappointed. I liked it, even if it didn't give me the answers I was

    DIVORCE</A><A NAME="DardDivorce"></A> (2007) -</B> Another one of 
   Olaf Ittenbach's incredibly gory flicks, which, unfortunately, is 
   ruined by awful acting, especially by lead actress Martina Ittenbach 
   (Yes, what you smell is indeed nepotism, as she is Olaf's wife). 
   Martina plays Nathalie Stein, an alcoholic lawyer who is going 
   through a bitter divorce with husband Tim (Barrett Jones). When Tim 
   takes their two children away for the weekend, Nathalie begins to 
   experience a strange set of events, beginning with the disappearance 
   of her dog and a note left on her floor that has one word on it, 
   &quot;Dard&quot;, written in blood (She will find out a short time 
   later that &quot;dard&quot; is Persian for &quot;pain&quot;). As she 
   slowly begins getting drunk in her home, Tim stumbles in with his 
   shirt full of blood and dies in front of her, but not before telling 
   her that someone took the children and then making an obtuse 
   reference to her missing dog. Nathalie calls the police, but when 
   they arrive, Tim's body is gone and so is any evidence. The police, 
   noticing that she has been drinking, decide to leave, but the next 
   morning, when neither Tim or the children can be found, Detective <A HREF="dard_divorce_2007.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dard divorce dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A>Warren
    (Jaymes Butler) shows up at Nathalie's home, taps her phone and then 
   tells her that Tim was involved in a drug rip-off, where he killed 
   five people and ran off with a million bucks. Nathalie begins to get 
   the impression that Det. Warren is not a cop at all and she is proven 
   correct when he handcuffs her to a chair and begins to slowly torture 
   her, first by repeatedly punching her in the face (really hard to 
   watch) and then cutting off some of her fingers and toes until she 
   tells him where the missing cocaine and money are. When Warren 
   reveals to Nathalie that he has killed her young son Jeremy 
   (flashbacks reveal him slicing Jeremy's head in two with a chainsaw), 
   Nathalie escapes her binds and kills Warren by slicing his neck with 
   a broken bottle. Suddenly, a man named Daniel (Daryl Jackson) appears 
   at Nathalie's door, helps her clean up the mess and tells her a 
   completely different story about Tim's predicament (Flashbacks show 
   innocent bystanders Tim and the children getting caught in the middle 
   of an extremely bloody drug deal gone wrong). Daniel offers Nathalie 
   a deal: Help him find the drugs and cash and he'll give her half the 
   money. Of course, Daniel turns out to be more violent than Warren, as 
   he drugs Nathalie, strips naked and begins dismembering Warren's body 
   in the bathtub, stuffing the body parts into plastic bags. When 
   Nathalie wakes up, she finds herself once again bound to a chair and 
   about to be tortured, only this time her arms and legs have been 
   injected with an anesthetic so she cannot move. She is viciously 
   tortured with a claw hammer before turning the tables on Daniel, but 
   a voice on the phone proves to be one more adversary she'll have to 
   deal with before the night is through. The ridiculous final 
   denouement will either have you throwing a heavy object at the screen 
   or beating yourself about the head for being so stupid for watching 
   this in the first place.&nbsp; Besides the incredible amount of gore 
   and a surprising amount of male frontal nudity, <B><A HREF="dard_divorce_2007b.htm">DARD
    DIVORCE</A></B> has very little going in it's favor. Like most of

    OF BLOOD</A></B> - 2005), the effects are top-notch, as is some of 
   the camerawork, but the acting abilities of the cast leaves way too 
   much to be desired and drags the film down quickly. The music is also 
   mixed way too high, drowning out some important dialogue during the 
   finale. I hate the term &quot;Torture Porn&quot;, but it describes 
   this film perfectly, as we watch people getting stabbed in the eyes 
   and crotch; watch as one man is decapitated and torn apart with a 
   shovel; witness Nathalie being beaten around the hands and mouth with 
   a claw hammer (until her lower lip is completely gone and all we see 
   are broken teeth and her lower jaw bone); see a man get his head 
   blown off with a shotgun; and too much other gory mayhem to mention. 
   Hey, if pain and suffering are your thing (it makes <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Hostel">HOSTEL</A></B> 
   [2005] look like a Disney film), then this is the film for you. But 
   if you want other inconsequential things, like a coherent plot (it's 
   like <B><A HREF="rashomon_1951.htm">RASHOMON</A></B> [1951] on

   female junkie and her baby sit down in a dank and dirty alley. It's 
   Sunday morning and services have just finished at Pastor James 
   Lowery's First Church and he's thanking all the parishioners for 
   attending as they walk out of church. James is a major proponent in 
   helping teenage junkies and runaways turn their lives around, so when 
   the cops show up a church to inform James that the body of a young 
   female junkie was found dead in an alley (luckily, the baby is OK), 
   he rushes to the alley and identifies the body as Ellie Palmer 
   (Sheree White), one of the runaways he was trying to rehabilitate. A 
   police detective (Charles Honce) doesn't agree with the way James 
   protects the kids from snitching to the cops about where they get

   Candyman (Chuck Mines), who beats-up Tim and shoots him full of 
   smack, but Tim manages to make it to the hospital and gives the 
   detective (who is never given a proper name) all the information he 
   needs to arrest The Candyman. Instead of slapping the cuffs on The

   catch the bigger fish connected to him. That bigger fish is 
   high-level drug supplier Herbert Trexler (Martin Beck) and when 
   corrupt police Lieutenant Untz (Phil Rubenstein) informs Trexler 
   about Tim spilling his guts to the police and Reverend James' role in 
   the situation, Trexler decides to shut them both up permanently. 
   While Reverend Jim is on a fishing trip with his family and Tim, 
   hitman Danny (Ron Lampkin) and an associate show up in a boat and 
   kill Tim, Rachel and one of their two sons, Eric (Todd Reep), by 
   shooting them at close range (it's startling in its brutality). James 
   is shot four times, but survives, and one of the shots destroys his 
   vocal chords, rendering him a mute. His other son, Jody (Todd's 
   real-life brother, Jeff Reep), who was also shot, is in a coma and 
   paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of his life, if he ever 
   wakes up. After a month recuperating in the hospital, unable to talk 
   to his comatose son and unwilling to cooperate with the police

   then decides maybe &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; is the way to go 
   when he saves the blind street preacher (remember him?) from two 
   drunks who try to mug him of his booze. When The Candyman walks into 
   the bar he frequents, James follows him to a bus station bathroom, 
   beats the crap out of him and then kills him by drowning him in a 
   toilet. Bar floozie Julie (Monique Proulx) befriends James (she calls 
   him &quot;Soldier&quot;) while he turns vigilante, killing all the 
   drug dealers he can get his hands on, first by using a knife taped to 
   his cane and then using more traditional weapons, like pistols and a 
   shotgun. A nervous Lt. Untz and a pissed-off Trexler try to uncover 
   the identity of the mysterious vigilante, while James gets closer to 
   achieving his goal of cleaning-up the streets and also discovering 
   that Jody has now awakened and his condition is not as dire as once 
   believed. Redemption is soon at hand for everyone involved, but will 
   James reconnect with God? The ending may surprise you.&nbsp; Directed

   The alcohol/religion relationship is strong here, as James loses his 
   religion and turns to alcohol and the blind man can't preach religion 
   unless he is blind stinking drunk. This is the perfect screen role 
   for Earl Owensby, who has a screen presence (not to mention the 
   hairiest torso of any person since George &quot;The Animal&quot; 
   Steele), but isn't much of an actor, so not being able to talk 
   through most of the film is a definite plus for the viewers. Most of 
   the other acting is strictly second-tier, but it works in the context 
   of this film and the violence, although mainly bloody bullet squibs, 
   is very effective and shocking in some scenes, especially the murder 
   of James' family and James' killing of Danny. Although nothing more

    DEAD ARE ALIVE</A><A NAME="DeadAreAlive"></A> (1972) -</B> This odd 
   mixture of German krimi and Italian giallo genres keeps your interest 
   even though it gets off to a rather confusing start. This is a murder 
   mystery with supernatural overtones, as alcoholic archaeologist Jason 
   Porter (Alex Cord) is at a dig site and discovers the tomb of an 
   ancient Etruscan demon god. A young couple making out at the ruins 
   are savagely slaughtered by unknown hands using one of Dr. Porter's 
   probes as a weapon. Hot-tempered orchestra conductor Nikos Samarakis 
   (John Marley) tries to disrupt Dr. Porter's life and steal his 
   ex-girlfriend Myra (Samantha Eggar) for reasons not yet known. Police 
   Inspector Giuranna (Enzo Tarascio) is assigned to the murder case and 
   interviews everyone (he thinks a &quot;sex killer&quot; is on the 
   loose). Not only does the Inspector find some of Dr. Porter's 
   Etruscan artwork missing, he also discovers that two pairs of red 
   shoes were taken from the costume <A HREF="dead_are_alive_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dead are alive dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>department
    of the opera Nikos is about to conduct. Is there a connection? The 
   answer becomes clear when Dr. Porter discovers the unconscious body 
   of assistant Igor (Carlo De Mejo) and the mutilated corpse of Igor's 
   girlfriend (wearing a pair of the red shoes) in a barn. The Inspector 
   suspects Dr. Porter (he's drunk most of the time), but Igor clears 
   him when he regains consciousness. Dr. Porter gets a phone call from 
   a female warning him to take Myra and leave if he doesn't want to see 
   both of them killed. Dr. Porter is also being blackmailed by a nasty 
   tour guide (we see the guide set fire to a spider and it's web just 
   for the fun of it) who has circumstantial evidence linking him to the 
   murders. His past (as a patient committed to a hospital in New York 
   fifteen years earlier for his alcoholism after he tried to kill Myra) 
   also comes to the forefront, thanks to Mikos. Porter finally gets 
   some evidence on Nikos, thanks to an unlikely source, which brings 
   Myra back into his arms. Porter finds the slaughtered bodies of 
   another couple after he makes an important discovery in the tomb, 
   which leads him to the identity of the real killer. He now has to 
   race against the clock to save Myra from the clutches of the

    ETRUSCAN KILLS AGAIN</A></B>) is a passable murder mystery, but 
   that's about it. The murder scenes aren't very original or filmed in 
   an exciting way, but the Etruscan ruins do add some atmosphere to the 
   proceedings, even if they are not fully utilized. The usually 
   excellent Alex Cord (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Inn Damned">INN

   - 1972) screams his lines rather than acting with them. He's pretty 
   aggravating and off-putting throughout most of the film as, what Dr. 
   Porter calls him, &quot;a sadistic pig&quot;. The real problem with 
   this film is that there is too much dead air and the killer is easy 
   to spot (at least to me). When watching this, I got the feeling that 
   I was watching second-rate Dario Argento (just before a murder 
   happens, Verdi opera music is heard), minus the fluid camerawork and 
   flashy visuals. By the time we come to the conclusion, where Dr. 
   Porter finally enters the Etruscan tomb and puts the pieces to the 
   murder mystery together, it's literally too late to give a damn. 
   While there is a smattering of nudity (none by Eggar, in case you 
   were wondering) and blood, it could have used more of both. This is 
   nothing extraordinary, but it's an O.K. mystery if your sights aren't 
   set too high. Also starring Nadja Tiller, Horst Frank, Enzo Cerusico 
   and Daniela Surina. Never available on VHS in the U.S. (it did play

   a few tense situations and bloody set pieces, including a standoff on

   Bob as his business partner of the Continental Detective Agency, but 
   Bob says no, as he and his fiancee Ellen Kent (Ini Assmann) are about 
   to fly to America to get married. Pepe tries to guilt Bob into 
   becoming his his partner, reminding him that he once saved Bob's 
   life, taking a bullet in his leg in the process, but Bob isn't 
   falling for it, telling Pepe he uses that excuse far too often. But 
   Bob changes his mind when Pepe tells him he is scared; he has an 
   important new client and the investigation&nbsp; could be the death 
   of him if he doesn't solve the case. The new client is the 
   influential and very rich Mr. Simmons (Renato Baldini; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#KidnapSyndicate">KIDNAP
    SYNDICATE</A></B> - 1975), who has hired Pepe to find his wife Lois 
   and to retrieve the very expensive necklace she was wearing. Bob is 
   intrigued, so he agrees to help Pepe investigate and solve the case. 
   When Lois' dead body is found, Bob asks Mr. Simmons how the state of 
   his marriage was and he answers, &quot;I am sixty-years-old, my wife 
   was twenty-five. Nonetheless, our union was perfect. We loved each 
   other very much.&quot; Bob reminds Mr. Simmons that his wife's 
   autopsy revealed she had sex with another man before she was 
   murdered, but Mr. Simmons yells back, &quot;With the killer! He raped 
   her!&quot; Pepe interrupts and guarantees Mr. Simmons that he and Bob 
   will do everything in their power to find Lois' killer.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Bob meets with Ellen to tell her that their trip to America to get 
   married has been delayed because he is working on an important case. 
   Ellen is understandably angry at Bob for once again delaying their 
   nuptials, accusing him of caring more about criminals than her. Bob 
   promises her a beautiful diamond wedding ring if she'll just be 
   patient with his duties as a private investigator. Ellen performs a 
   judo move on Bob, sending him to the floor and she laughs, but Bob 
   uses a judo move on her, sending Ellen to the couch, where they begin 
   making love, but a phone call from Pepe interrupts them, Pepe telling 
   Bob that he has three plane tickets and they need to leave for Italy 
   immediately. Bob tells Ellen to pack her bags, she now works for the 
   Continental Detective Agency (We know that Ellen can take care of 
   herself, but is she qualified to be a private investigator? This film 
   never tells us!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see Charly and Riccardo on a speedboat, heading for a yacht 
   belonging to Mr. Feretti, whom we never meet. Charly hands Riccardo a 
   note that reads: &quot;I, Riccardo Beni, declare to have seen Mrs. 
   Simmons' murderer.&quot; Charly tells Riccardo to memorize that line 
   because it is the only way Charly will ever pay back Mr. Ferretti the 
   loan he took out with him for his business. Confused? So am I, but be 
   patient because all the pieces will soon fit together in their own 
   off-kilter way. Charly wants to blackmail Maria for $100,000, 
   threatening to tell the police that Riccardo saw Francesco kill Lois 
   Simmons unless she pays up. Bob becomes suspicious of Charly when his 
   dog Fritz (who goes everywhere with Charly) nearly chews Bob a new 
   asshole while he is feeding swans in a fountain on Charly's property 
   (Talk about a major coincidence!). Bob follows Charly to a bank, 
   where Charly tries to get a loan so he can buy property belonging to 
   Maria's wealthy family, where he plans on building another hotel, but 
   the bank manager refuses the loan, telling Charly that he knows Maria 
   and the Villaverde family and there is no way in hell they would sell 
   that property for any amount of money, as the Villaverdes has lived 
   on that property for centuries. Charly walks out of the bank with a 
   &quot;we'll see&quot; look on his face. Blackmail should get him that 
   land, but he doesn't know Maria that well or, especially, Francesco's hair-trigger
    temper.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Bob decides to check out the Villaverdes, posing as a tourist and 
   discovering Francesco putting the finishing touches on Lois' portrait 
   outside Maria's mansion, complete with the expensive necklace around 
   her neck. Bob says that the portrait looks a lot like the woman who 
   was recently murdered, but Francesco says no, every portrait looks 
   like someone you know. Maria then appears and asks Bob if he is with 
   the police. Bob fesses up, telling Maria and Francesco that he is a 
   private investigator hired to find out who killed Lois Simmons and to 
   find the necklace she was wearing. Maria quickly takes Bob's arm, 
   telling him she will give him a tour of the mansion. Bob is sure 
   Francesco is the killer, so he tells Ellen to cozy up to him to get 
   proof for the police (Way to put you future wife in danger, Bob!). He 
   tells Pepe to pretend to be Ellen's father, a job Pepe is not too 
   comfortable with (because he has a conscience, unlike Bob!). When 
   Charly and Amato learn of the expensive missing necklace, Charly has 
   Amato beat the shit out of Riccardo, thinking he took it, but 
   Riccardo tells them he didn't take it; when he saw Lois' body, he 
   just quickly walked away. Charly then gets a phone call from crime 
   boss Professor Max Spiegler (Adolfo Celi; <B><A HREF="#WhoSawHerDie">WHO
    SAW HER DIE?</A></B> - 1972), who tells Charly that his plane just 
   landed at the airport and he is with Sophia Feretti (Anita Ekberg; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#KillerNun1978">THE</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="exploitation.htm#KillerNun1978"> </A></FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#KillerNun1978">KILLER

   knows that this is a not-so-veiled-threat against himself, as Mr. 
   Feretti owed Max a small amount of money that he didn't pay back in 
   time. Charly took a loan out with Mr. Feretti to build his beach 
   hotel and he knows Max and Mrs. Feretti have come here to collect on 
   it. Repayment of the loan (including the vig) is due very soon, so 
   finding the necklace and fencing it will give Charly the money he 
   needs to repay the loan. But if Riccardo doesn't have the necklace, 
   who does? Is it possible a third person watched Francesco strangle Mrs<A HREF="death_knocks_twice_1969.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blonde connection poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="194" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> Simmons?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Riccardo pays Maria a visit to tell her he saw Francesco strangle 
   Lois Simmons, telling her that Charly made him sign a piece of paper 
   saying so. Maria is not surprised at all, but when Riccardo sees 
   Charly and Amato walking up the driveway, he beats a hasty retreat 
   (even though Charly and Amato saw him). Charly approaches Maria and 
   introduces Amato as an influential art collector who may be 
   interested in purchasing Francesco paintings, but first he must talk 
   to Francesco in person. Maria takes them to Francesco, who is 
   painting outside by the beach. Amato shakes his hand and tells 
   Francesco he loves the painting he is currently working on, but he 
   would like to see his other paintings. Francesco takes Amato to his 
   studio, leaving Charly alone with Maria. Charly begins to blackmail 
   Maria, telling her that Francesco's portrait of Mrs. Simmons would 
   interest the police. The film then cuts to an art gallery displaying 
   Francesco's paintings, all of them portraits of beautiful 
   blonde-haired women. Even though the film doesn't come outright and 
   say it, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to think all these 
   blonde-haired women may be previous victims of Francesco's strangling 
   rage, so why isn't there talk of a serial killer being on the loose? 
   (Be patient!). Amato, who is putting on the gallery showing, made 
   sure that Lois Simmons' portrait took center stage, just to worry 
   Maria how easy it would be to expose her husband as a murderer. Bob, 
   who is at the showing, tells Pepe to make sure Ellen gets close to 
   Francesco. Ellen does it by looking at Mrs. Simmons' portrait while 
   another guest says, &quot;I tell you, it's Mrs. Simmons. I'm sure of 
   it! I also remember her necklace perfectly!&quot;. Max and Mrs. 
   Feretti are also at the gallery, but when Francesco sets his sights 
   on the blonde-haired Ellen, it's love at first sight, which doesn't 
   go unnoticed by Maria. Pepe introduces his &quot;daughter&quot; to 
   Francesco, but before he can say anything else, Francesco takes 
   Ellen's arm and leads her away, like he owns her.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Later that day, Max and Mrs. Feretti have a meeting with Charly (and 
   his dog Fritz), Mrs. Feretti reminding Charly that her late husband 
   loaned him $100,000 and he's fifteen days late in repaying it. She's 
   here with Max to collect the hundred grand plus the vig. Mrs. Feretti 
   also tells Charly that she sent a spy to check if the Sun &amp; Sea 
   Hotel is doing good business and he told her that the business was 
   very profitable, so Charly should be able to pay back the loan as 
   promised, telling him he doesn't want to end up like her husband. 
   Mrs. Feretti wants Charly to sign a piece of paper stating he will 
   pay her $150,000 within ten days, otherwise ownership of the Sun &amp;
    Sea Hotel will be hers. Charly tells Max and Mrs. Feretti he will 
   not sign it, so Max grabs Charly's hand, which is holding a glass of 
   scotch (care to guess which <A HREF="j&amp;b_scotch_whiskey_in_italian_films.htm">brand</A>?),
    and squeezes it hard until the glass breaks. Charly's hand is cut 
   and bloody, causing Fritz to growl and try to attack Max, but Amato 
   calls the dog off. Mrs. Feretti and Max then leave, Mrs. Feretti 
   asking where Francesco lives and Amato giving her the address. 
   Francesco is giving Ellena tour of the Villaverde estate grounds, 
   telling her his life was boring until he met her (Really? In such a 
   short time?). he says, &quot;I like swans. I spend many hours 
   watching them. If you knew, Ellen, how boring life is in a provincial 
   town...that was, until yesterday, until I met you, I saw you. Believe 
   me.&quot; (Oh stop, you're making me horny! No one ever said!) 
   Francesco tells Ellen that he wants to spend every minute of every 
   day with her and then asks to paint her portrait. Uh,oh! All the 
   while he talks, Ellen doesn't say a single word. Pepe, who is with 
   Maria, says it is very late and asks where &quot;daughter&quot; and 
   her husband are. maria says she doesn't know, so Pepe stokes the fire 
   within Maria by saying Ellen wanted to leave this town right away 
   when she head about the sexual crime committed on Lois Simmons. Maria 
   quickly turns around and is about to say something, but she stops 
   herself. meanwhile, Ellen plays along with Francesco and agrees to 
   meet him on the rocks by the beach tomorrow morning so he can begin 
   to paint her portrait. She then kisses him goodbye, not like a 
   friend, but as a lover would.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see Amato and Riccardo in a car outside the hotel. Amato 
   asks Riccardo to get him a pack of cigarettes and kills him by 
   throwing the station wagon in reverse and crushing him against a 
   giant iron anchor that resides in front of the hotel. Amato then 
   jumps into another car and drives away, leaving Riccardo's dead body 
   pinned between the anchor and the station wagon's back bumper. That 
   same night, Bob hits on pretty hotel desk worker Angela 
   (H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Chanel; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#MacisteInHell1962">MACISTE
    IN HELL</A></B> - 1962), so she takes him to her room, whick looks 
   like it has been ransacked. Angela runs to a secret drawer in her 
   closet and pulls out Mrs. Simmons' necklace. Bob wants to know who 
   gave it to her, but she refuses to tell him. There's a knock on 
   Angela's door and another female worker tells her that Riccardo is 
   dead. Bob asks Angela if Riccardo gave her the necklace and she says 
   no, Riccardo was the only &quot;clean&quot; person working at the 
   hotel. Charly and a couple of goons arrive at Angela's door, banging 
   on it and demanding they be let in. Bob lets Angela escape out one of 
   the windows, Angela telling him to meet her at the pool tonight and 
   she will tell him who gave her the necklace. The two goons break down 
   the door, only to find Bob in his pajamas. A fistfight breaks out and 
   Bob easily wins, but Charly sigs Fritz on him and the dog chases him 
   out the window and into the pool, where Bob saves Fritz because he 
   doesn't know how to swim! Bob now has a canine friend for life. 
   Angela then calls Bob over to spill the beans, but we don't hear what 
   she is saying.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Pepe tells Bob that Maria told him that Francesco spent some time in 
   a psychiatric clinic when he was younger. He also tells Bob that 
   Ellen doesn't think Francesco is a killer. A womanizer? Yes, but a 
   killer? No. Bob finds Ellen in his bed, where she calls him a 
   &quot;pimp&quot; (She's right) and accuses him of sleeping with the 
   female staff of the hotel (Right again). Bob accuses Ellen of having 
   a romantic interest in Francesco, saying to her that they are not 
   married yet and she still has time to change her mind (Everything 
   Ellen said about Bob was true, but did Bob have to say such a hurtful 
   thing? Bob is an asshole, plain and simple.). The next morning, while 
   Francesco is painting Ellen's portrait while she is sitting on the 
   rocks in a bikini, Bob goes to the psychiatric clinic Francesco was 
   committed to and talks to the doctor in charge, learning some 
   interesting things about both Francesco and Maria. Rather than making 
   you watch the film to find out what Bob has learned, I will tell you 
   outright, because this film didn't earn my respect the way that most 
   films do. <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">Warning: SPOILERS!!!</FONT></B> Amato 
   actually killed Mrs. Simmons so he could steal the necklace. 
   Francesco never killed anyone. A bad sexual experience with an older 
   woman during Francesco's youth caused him to choke his female lovers 
   until they were unconscious, but he never murdered any of them (it is 
   why he spent time in the psychiatric clinic). Professor Max Spiegler 
   reveals himself to be Mr. Feretti (Wouldn't Charly know this since he 
   took out a loan with Mr. Feretti?) and he guns down Charly and Amato 
   to get his hands on the necklace (Amato's death is the most brutal 
   killing in the film). He tries to kill Bob, but Bob kills Max/Mr. 
   Feretti in a hail of bullets. Francisco commits suicide by drowning 
   himself in the ocean after choking Ellen, as he can't live with his 
   women-strangling activities any longer. Bob jumps in the ocean to 
   save him, but he's too late. <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">END OF SPOILERS!!!</FONT></B> 
   Mr. Simmons hands Bob a check for a job well done, but Bob tears it 
   up, saying it is blood money, blaming Mr. Simmons for all of these 
   deaths for not telling him and Pepe the entire truth. The film ends

    This rather boring and uneventful thriller, not quite a giallo and 
   not much of a murder mystery (If I made it sound interesting, I

   very scant 78-minute running time and there is very little nudity 
   (just a short flash of breasts by the beautiful Femi Benussi in the 
   beginning of the film and brief shots of a nude (and dead) Anita 
   Ekberg in bed at the end of the film) and is lacking in the blood and 
   violence departments, too. That's sad, because this film has a roster 
   of great genre actors, but they are given very little to do here. The 
   life and death of American actor/singer Dean Reed is a much more 
   interesting mystery than what this film holds. Google his name to 
   discover his life's highs and lows, including his mysterious death in 
   1985. Believe me, it's quite the story (So much so, that Tom Hanks 
   has optioned his life story for a future film!). The only good thing

   Serena's challenge for the next bet: If Paul wins, he gets all his 
   money back. If he loses, Kitty must spend the night with Georgie. 
   Paul loses and Kitty goes off with Georgie, who asks Kitty if she 
   will take off her clothes, Kitty replying that he should take off her 
   clothes! Serena then mentions that Anthony is a psychic magician and 
   that he can tell a person's past by just holding one of their 
   personal possessions. Nikki gives Anthony her compact and he says it 
   once belonged to a person who is dead now and they died a violent 
   death. Nikki says he is right, the compact belonged to her mother and 
   she died in a plane crash two years ago. Serena then says that 
   Anthony can also tell the future and Anthony doesn't want to do it, 
   but the group convinces him to do it. Anthony then holds a seance by 
   candlelight while Charlie records it on a reel-to-reel tape recorder. 
   &quot;The women will change...their appearances. They will go back in 
   time. (<I>long pause</I>) Music, I hear music. It's terrible, help, 
   help!&quot;, Anthony says in a trance, as he puts out the candle with 
   the palm of his hand. He then tells everyone to leave the castle, 
   saying they are all in danger if they stay. Everyone thinks it is 
   nothing but a parlor trick, so they stay, even though Anthony leaves 
   the castle. They should have listened to him.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then find out why Catherine is in such a bad mood. This was 
   supposed to be her weekend with Richard, as they are lovers. That 
   night, Richard enters her bedroom and apologises, telling Catherine 
   that he will make it up to her next weekend, She accuses him of being 
   romantically involved with Serena, Richard telling her that is not 
   true, proving it by slowly removing her stockings (Hey, this is the 
   early-'60s after all!). He then throws the stackings in Catherine's 
   face (Richard is a real odd duck). Serena leads all the girls up to 
   the attic, where they try on clothes they find in old trunks (This is 
   as close to nudity as the film gets, as we see quick flashes of the 
   girls in their bras and panties). The guys go looking for the girls, 
   Charlie seeing them dressed as 1920's flappers. He says Anthony's 
   predictions are coming true (&quot;The women will change...their 
   appearances. They will go back in time.&quot;) and then hears Richard 
   playing the piano (&quot;Music, I hear music.&quot;), causing Charlie 
   to get very scared and nervous.&nbsp; Could Anthony's pedictions be 
   true? Are their lives in danger? Charlie certainly thinks so.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Suddenly, a scream echoes throughout the castle. It's Frankie and 
   she has found Serena dead in her bed, her dead hand holding Aldo's 
   handkerchief. Aldo is nowhere to be found and since there is no 
   telephone in the castle, Georgie goes to take his car to the nearest 
   police station, but the key to the garage is missing and there is no 
   way they can break through the garage's heavy metal doors. Aldo 
   suddenly appears and the guys restrain him, locking him in one of the 
   rooms. Edie says Aldo couldn't possibly be the killer because when 
   Frankie screamed, Aldo was with her. So who did it? The group come to 
   the conclusion that one of them (including Catherine) is the killer, 
   but what is their motive? It's not long before members of the group 
   begin turning on each other, discovering the secrets that each of 
   them are hiding (Paul has stolen an expensive ring from Serena's dead 
   body to pay his gambling debts; Catherine knows all about the secret 
   passageways in the castle [every castle has them]; Richard once spent 
   some time in an insane asylum, etc.). Aldo uses one of the secret 
   passageways to escape from the room he is locked in, keeping a close 
   eye on everyone else. Richard then discovers Frankie dead in one of 
   the rooms, but he can't get anyone else to believe him, because her 
   body has disappeared. The group then accuse Richard of being the 
   killer, as they split up (never a good thing) to search the castle 
   for Frankie. Richard then sees that Frankie is very much alive when 
   he looks in a mirror, but when he turns around, she is nowhere to be 
   found. Richard believes he is going insane (again), so Catherine 
   tries to comfort him, saying she will always be there by his side, 
   but Richard tells her to leave him alone. Charles and Nikki find one 
   of the secret passageways, but they get separated when the door 
   closes on Nikki. Aldo grabs Nikki, telling her that he will protect 
   her, but Catherine appears and chases him away. What in the world is 
   going on in this castle, besides discovering that no one is who they 
   seem to be? Is Richard full-tilt Bozo? (He tries to commit suicide by 
   slitting his wrists, but Lucy-Ann stops him).&nbsp; We then discovers 
   that one of the group is, indeed, the killer as they are setting up 
   Richard to take the fall and making it look like he went crazy again. 
   The killer's motive is to make it look like Richard killed Frankie, 
   who is very much alive, Frankie doing something to the killer in the 
   past that they have not forgotten or forgived. When the killer is 
   discovered by the rest of the group, suicide by gunshot to the head 
   is the only way out, the killer's dead body falling into bed with 
   Serena's corpse. Death by fourposter is complete.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This obscure piece of modern Gothic horror/mystery may not be 
   exceptional, but it is an interesting genre film, mainly for the way 
   it deals <A HREF="death_on_the_fourposter_1964.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/death on the fourposter italy poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="228" HEIGHT="308" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>with
    sex and sexuality. While sex is not uttered once in this film, it 
   permeates nearly every frame, as neither the girls or the guys can 
   get their minds off of it (in an early-'60s sort of way, that is). It 
   is obvious that Kitty's tight, form-fitting one-piece pantsuit is 
   meant to tantilize and titillize the guys, as she shakes her ass in 
   it as much as she possibly can. Even though the rest of the girls, 
   excluding Serena, are rather pure and chaste, their real feelings 
   come out when they are all in the bathroom, talking about which guy 
   they are going to be with for the weekend, not knowing that the guys 
   are doing the same thing. When the guys ask Richard what girl he 
   wants to be with, he replies, &quot;It doesn't matter. All women are 
   the same.&quot; telling us all we need to know about him.&nbsp; 
   Director Jean Josipovici (This is his last directorial effort. He 
   directed three obscure films in the '50s and also wrote the 
   screenplay to <B><A HREF="passport_for_a_corpse_1962.htm">PASSPORT 
   FOR A CORPSE</A></B> - 1962), who co-wrote the screenplay with 
   Giorgio Stegani (the director of the poliziotteschi <B><A HREF="last_desperate_hours_1974.htm">THE
    LAST DESPERATE HOURS</A></B> - 1974 and one of the writers of <B><A HREF="cannibal_holocaust_1980.htm">CANNIBAL
    HOLOCAUST</A></B> - 1980), has fashioned a film that is part murder 
   mystery, part supernatural horror, but it never drags or is boring 
   (at least to me). Ignore the IMDb, as they state that Ambrogio 
   Molteni (screenwriter of <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EerieMidnight1974">THE
    EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW</A></B> - 1974 and <B><A HREF="violence_in_a_womens_prison_1982.htm">VIOLENCE
    IN A WOMEN'S PRISON</A></B> - 1982) co-directed this film with 
   Josipovici, but that just isn't true, as the opening credits reveal 
   that he was this film's Assistant Director. I have contacted IMDb to 
   make that change, but I know that it will take more than my sayso to 
   make them change a mistake. The acting is very good here, especially 
   by John Drew Barrymore. Although his role as Anthony is nothing but 
   an extended cameo, he registers here and his seance is appropriately 
   creepy. While not very violent, this film does have a certain visual 
   flair (photography by Raffaele Masciocchi; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Ghost1963">THE
    GHOST</A></B> - 1963), using the castle interiors to good advantage.

   following her. As she gets to the front door of her home, she turns 
   around, where a man with a camera shoots seven quick flashes in her 
   face, forcing her to pass out. The next morning, Julie is at work, 
   where she works as a translator, when she gets a phone call from her 
   twin sister Mary (Baker again). Julie tells her that she is too busy 
   to take her call and she should call her at home that night, but Mary 
   tells her it can't wait, telling Julie that she feels her life is 
   being threatened, the phone call going dead as soon as she says 
   that.&nbsp; Julie goes to Dave's office and tells him about Mary, 
   also telling him that she thinks she is being followed. Dick tells 
   her he will look into both matters and Julie leaves his office. While 
   she is on the street, two thugs try to kidnap her and try to put her

   where she tells them about her sister, saying she said over the 
   phone, &quot;My husband. My husband.&quot; Julie thinks that is weird 
   because she thought Mary and her husband were getting a divorce. She 
   shows them a photo of herself with Mary and asks them to tell her 
   which one is Julie and which one is Mary. The only difference is 
   their hair color (Julie is a blonde, Mary is a brunette), but Julie 
   tells them there is a small difference in their noses and sometimes 
   Mary likes to pretend she is her (information important in this film

   Dick asks her secretary, Margaret (Lucretia Love; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EerieMidnight1974">THE

    Julie borrows a client's apartment to live in until this mess blows 
   over. She's also taking a week-long holiday from work. Julie begins 
   to get a series of phone calls with no one on the other end and it 
   scares her, especially when the lights go out in the apartment 
   complex. Using a cigarette lighter as her only means of light, Julie 
   checks up on her new neighbor, finding her dead in the building's 
   cobweb-filled attic. Julie screams and faints, waking up with Tony by 
   her side. She tells him what she saw in the attic and when Tony goes 
   there to investigate, the body is missing. She then asks Tony why he 
   is here and he tells Julie that he came to pick up his briefcase, 
   which he accidentally left there.&nbsp; Dick is paid a visit by Steve 
   Hunter (Luciano Pigozzi; <B><A HREF="#SevenDeathsCatsEyes">SEVEN 
   DEATHS IN THE CAT'S EYE</A></B> - 1973), an insurance investigator 
   who tells him that Mary collected a million dollars on a policy for a 
   stolen priceless diamond, which he believes was stolen by Mary. He 
   wants Dick to talk to Julie to get her sister to turn over the money 
   and the diamond, no questions asked. Dick calls Julie, who tells him 
   that her sister just called her and said that no one is following her 
   at the moment, so she feels much better (making the connection yet?). 
   Dave tells Julie about the money and the diamond, but she already 
   knew about both, telling him that when Mary called, she said she was 
   returning the money and the diamond in the post to the insurance 
   company (the post?!?). And then things start to get very interesting,

   Tony is there. She says no and he tells her to lock all her doors and 
   to let no one in, especially Tony. Before Dave can get there, Julie 
   leaves the apartment, but is caught by Steve, who brings her back to 
   the apartment to wait for Tony (they are working together). Harry

   film is sped-up) and when they run him off the road and shoot him 
   dead, they discover it is not Tony at all, but a decoy. Tony arrives 
   at the apartment and slaps the shit out of Julie when he discovers 
   the diamond she has hidden is a glass fake.

   very colorful and is a good choice to watch when you can't decide

   carries the film as an average Joe who takes advantage of a situation 
   not of his doing, only to have it spiral out of control to the point 
   where it would drive a sane person crazy. The biggest roadblock for 
   Stan's plan's success is pesky neighbor Walter (and his even peskier 
   dog), who hits on Vera, shows up at the most inopportune times and 
   seems to have an agenda of his own. Things go from bad to worse when 
   the body Stan has buried refuses to stay in the ground. The capper is 
   the reading of Maud's will, where it states that the bulk of her 
   estate will be held in trust for Vera's naturally-born children, 
   knowing damn-well that there will be no children as long as Vera is 
   married to Stan. If you think that's the end of the film, think 
   again. The police become involved, Stan is questioned at headquarters 
   and there's on hell of a surprise ending. The script (by J.C. 
   Rapoport and Robert L. Fish) is top-notch and the acting uniformly 
   excellent (you'll want to strangle Geraldine Fitzgerald, she's that 
   mean). I'm surprised more isn't written about this excellent thriller 
   (a lot of reference books get the plot all wrong), which is devoid of 
   graphic gore or violence. It doesn't need it. Just watching one man's 
   descent into a hell he doesn't deserve is reward enough. I'm still 
   trying to figure out why it's called <B>DIARY OF THE DEAD</B>, 
   though. That's a real head-scratcher. This film is full of 
   recognizable character actors, including Austin Pendleton, Richard 
   Venture, James Naughton, George Spalding, Lee Wallace, Joyce Ebert 
   and Kate Wilkinson. A Vista Home Video Release. Not available on DVD. <B>Rated

   survived the fatal stabbing in the finale of the first film. Adrian 
   is still as unstable as ever, living in a Winnebago and apparently 
   killing prostitutes at night (the latest victim is an undercover cop 
   in drag, who gets an icepick graphically shoved through his neck), 
   while making weekly visits to his psychiatrist, Dr. Frank Curtis 
   (Seymour Cassel; <B><A HREF="death_game_1977.htm">DEATH GAME</A></B>

   Adrian makes a living as an advertising photographer and his latest

    both appendages in real life in a 1973 motorcycle accident). B.J. is 
   a bitter man whose wife left him after the accident and took the kids 
   with her, leaving him an abusive alcoholic and a misogynist. Adrian 
   and Mindy go on their dinner date and hit it off, agreeing to go on a 
   second date the next night, but a series of events will make that 
   date hard to keep. That night, Adrian has a nightmare where he kills 
   a pretty swimsuit model in a pool, so he make a pact with B.J. to 
   keep him company every night just to make sure the nightmares don't 
   turn into reality. It doesn't work. The next night, another hooker 
   (an early role for Sally Kirkland) has her neck snapped by someone 
   wearing brown leather gloves (the film takes-on a giallo atmosphere 
   in this scene) and when the swimsuit model Adrian dreamed about is 
   actually found dead in the pool, Adrian grows more despondent and 
   ignores phone calls from Mindy. Meanwhile, cops Sgt. Fontain (Pamela 
   Hensley; <B><A HREF="nude_bomb_1980.htm">THE NUDE BOMB</A></B> - 
   1980) and Sgt. Buckhold (David Young; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Mary Bloody Mary">MARY.
    MARY, BLOODY MARY</A></B> - 1975) catch flak from their police chief 
   (Cleavon Little) for failing to catch the killer. The question soon 
   becomes: Is Adrian the killer or could it be someone else? Could it 
   be B.J., who manages to insult every woman he meets, as well as 
   taunting Adrian's homosexual assistant, Lewis (Don Potter), thanks to 
   his deep-seated hatred for his ex-wife? Or could it be Dr. Curtis, 
   who seems to take a more-than-professional interest in Adrian's 
   nightmares? What about Mindy? We really know nothing about her except 
   that she is a patient of Dr. Curtis. What is she being treated for? 
   Adrian's nightmares increase, including images of Mindy being stabbed 
   in the stomach, himself being blown away by a jealous husband with a 
   shotgun and killing a model by sticking her head in a plastic garbage 
   bag containing a live rattlesnake. When more and more of Adrian's 
   subjects end up murdered in real life and Mindy is stabbed just like 
   in his nightmares, the real killer reveals himself (it's not much of 
   a surprise), only to be stabbed in the neck with a broken bottle by 
   Mindy, who is not quite as dead as in Adrian's dreams.&nbsp; Though 
   not as frenetic as <B>THE PHOTOGRAPHER</B>, director Hillman (<B><A HREF="ragin_cajun_1991.htm">RAGIN'
    CAJUN</A></B> - 1991) eschews that film's PG rating and goes for the 
   R-rated goods here, including plentiful female nudity (featuring a 
   rare topless scene by Joanna Pettet) and some gory murders. Unlike <B>THE
    PHOTOGRAPHER</B>, Michael Callan has only one freak-out scene here, 
   something that made the first film such a hoot to watch. The addition 
   of James Stacy as Callan's brother is a good choice because they 
   closely resemble each other and share the same mannerisms, which 
   gives the film a shot of believability. Hillman also offers us a cast 
   of great character actors, including Seymour Cassel, Cleavon Little 
   and Robert Tessier as Aleck the bartender, but the roles are so 
   underwritten, they are wasted. As it stands, <B><A HREF="double_exposure_1982.htm">DOUBLE

   but it lacks the looniness factor of its predecessor. Sometimes

   at the beginning of the construction site, Steve drives his Range 
   Rover deep into the woods until the ground growth becomes too thick. 
   They then head out on foot to get a closer look at the beautiful, but

    breaks into the house of young gang leader Brett (Jack O'Connell) 
   and nearly gets caught by Brett's drunken letch of a father. Steve 
   and Jenny then stupidly head back to the quarry, only to have Brett 
   and his gang steal their Range Rover. They confront Brett in the 
   middle of the woods, which leads to Steve accidentally killing 
   Brett's dog. The chase is then on, as Steve and Jenny try to escape 
   in the Range Rover, but Steve crashes and is caught by the underage 
   gang, where they bound Steve with barb wire (with the dead dog's 
   choke collar around his neck) and Brett forces members of his gang to 
   slice Steve with knives and box cutters (a hard scene to watch). When 
   Brett spots Jenny and the gang give chase on their BMX bikes, Steve 
   escapes and eventually joins-up with Jenny. Steve is slowly bleeding 
   to death (he finally gives Jenny the engagement ring, as he's been 
   trying to propose to her throughout the film, but shit always 
   happens) and Jenny has to make a hard choice: Leave a critically 
   injured Steve behind and look for help by herself or kill the kids, 
   which goes against everything she believes in. After killing a couple 
   of the kids, Jenny escapes into the town and crashes the Range Rover 
   at a party being thrown by the town's adults, where she will learn 
   the hard way that the apples don't fall far from the tree.&nbsp; The 
   first thing that really stands out about this film and sets it apart 
   from most other &quot;terror in the woods&quot; films is that the 
   killers are a bunch of heartless kids, which makes their crimes all 
   the more horrifying. What even makes it worse is that the lone female 
   member of the gang, Abi (Tara Ellis), records all her gang's tortures 
   and bloodshed on her camera phone so they all can watch it later on 
   (which mimics a real-life case involving murderous teens in the 
   Ukraine). Director/writer James Watkins (his directorial debut) 
   builds the suspense slowly and drops hints as to why these kids act 
   this way (every other adult in this film besides Steve and Jenny are 
   either child abusers, drunks or flat-out refuse to take 
   responsibility for their children), but he makes no excuses for them. 
   These kids are just bad and do whatever Brett tells them, so when 
   Jenny is pushed to her limits (She's tied to a tree and forced to 
   watch as the kids burn Steve's corpse), she tosses her schoolteacher 
   codes aside and begins killing kids (she stabs one kid in the neck 
   with a shard of glass and runs over Abi with a car). The message 
   Watkins sends to the audience comes through loud and clear, 
   especially during the (not-so-surprising) finale: Children are a 
   product of their environment, both personal and ecological. It makes 
   me wonder how the future snobby residents of the gated community of 
   Eden Lake will get along with their neighbors, but that's another 
   film I hope will be told. The violence here is brutal (even the 
   plentiful overhead shots convey a sense of loneliness and dread), 
   especially since most of it comes by the hands or towards children, 
   but since this was filmed in England, there is nary a gun in sight, 
   which is refreshing (most of the violence is knife or sharp object 
   related), as is the fact that cell phones actually work in these 
   woods (and this is the first time that I can recall that BlueTooth 
   technology is used to track someone). I look forward to James 
   Watkins' next film. He's a talent to watch. Also starring Thomas

    to a massive standoff and shootout between the Monroe family and the

   Ben (Michael Parks; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#FrenchQuarterUnderc">FRENCH

   - 1977) and, damn, if it isn't the old Monroe farmhouse (Jake makes 
   an off-the-cuff remark that the mineral rights on this land belong to 
   the &quot;previous owners&quot; and are not included in the sale of 
   the house). Ruth falls in love with the house and can't wait to start 
   a family there, so they buy the house, which seems to please Jake way 
   too much (turns out Jake is one of their neighbors). While Ben drives 
   to his new job at a cotton mill, Ruth make the long walk into town to 
   pick up some groceries and notices the townspeople are pretty 
   standoffish towards her (Jake tells her, &quot;They're shy with 
   strangers&quot;, but to give it time). When she gets home, Ruth finds 
   a message in her mailbox that says &quot;I want you to move&quot; 
   that looks like it was written by a child on a torn piece of a brown 
   paper bag. She begins locking the front door of the house (which was 
   unheard of back then) and she asks Ben if they can go to church on 
   Sunday. A traveling peddler (Lucius Farris) stops by the house to 
   sell Ruth some wares and tells her the strange history of the house, 
   where many people have died horrible deaths living there since the 
   &quot;Monroe massacre&quot;. Flashbacks reveal that a husband and 
   wife living in the house in 1934 suffered terrible fates. A man in a 
   floppy hat killed the wife and husband by bonking them on the head 
   with a horseshoe attached to a stick (to make it look like they were 
   kicked in the head by a mule) and then let the family mule drag their 
   bodies around the property. Before the peddler can tell Ruth any more 
   stories, she and Ben go to church (but not before Ben hires the 
   peddler to chop wood in a couple of days), where they meet their 
   cheerful, wheelchair-bound neighbor Olie Gibson (Sue Ann Langdon; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#WithoutWarning1979">WITHOUT
    WARNING</A></B> - 1979), who invites Ruth over for coffee and cake. 
   Ben and Ruth attend a Sunday picnic at Mr. Bruckner's (Jimmy Clem) 
   plantation, where Ruth confronts Jake about her house's history, but 
   all Jake does is make improper advances towards her (All the women at 
   the picnic find excuses not to come to the house when Ruth invites 
   them over). It's not long before Ruth and Ben begin experiencing 
   strange occurrences at the house (like the floppy hat-wearing man 
   looking in their windows in the middle of the night), but when Ben 
   has to leave town on business and Olie tells Ruth about some more 
   murders that happened in the house in 1939 (flashback alert), where a 
   young married couple were killed by a floppy-hatted stranger (the 
   husband was electrocuted and the wife burned alive), Ruth must defend 
   herself against unseen forces, especially when the peddler returns to 
   chop some wood and gets an axe planted in his back for his troubles. 
   When Ruth accidentally shoots and kills Ben<A HREF="evictors_1979b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/evictors dutch vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="173" HEIGHT="250" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   when she mistake's him for an intruder, the truth about the house is 
   finally revealed. The moral to the story? Don't trust cheerful old 
   women in wheelchairs, because, really, what do they have to be 
   cheerful about except getting revenge on everyone that lives in a 
   home that was once hers? That's right, Olie is actually a Monroe and 
   she lets her crazy husband Dwayne (Glen Roberts) out of his locked 
   room (with his floppy hat) every time someone new moves into the 
   house. Will Ruth be the next victim? A final sting at the end of the 
   film reveals Ruth's surprising fate, as well as that the house has 
   not given up its killing ways, even five years later.&nbsp; Say what 
   you want about Charles B. Pierce (who also produced and co-wrote the 
   screenplay with Gary Rusoff and Paul Fisk), but he had a knack for 
   creating period mood and atmosphere, especially the ambiance of 
   living in 1930's &amp; 40's Louisiana by the use of period clothing, 
   music, props, vehicles (Pierce did the same thing for late-40's 
   Texarkana in <B><A HREF="town_that_dreaded_sundown_1976b.htm">THE 
   TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN</A></B>) and subtle hints about our 
   involvement in World War II (Ben works as a foreman for the cheap Mr. 
   Bruckner at one of his cotton mills, where they produce material for 
   soldiers' uniforms). Though made the same year as <B><A HREF="amityville_horror_1979.htm">THE

   about a cursed house, but for much different reasons), even if the 
   violence is much more restrained. I sincerely believe Pierce was a 
   solid director and hopefully his films will now be rediscovered and 
   re-evaluated since his death in early 2010. It's a shame that a 
   person has to die to have their work appreciated, but, hey, that's

   If you ever had the feeling that you were being watched, this film 
   will make you very nervous. This takes the word &quot;voyeurism&quot; 
   and gives it a whole new meaning. When we first see Arturo (John 
   Phillip Law; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BloodDelirium1988">BLOOD DELIRIUM</A></B> 
   - 1988), he is eyeing-up a woman in a short skirt while traveling on 
   a train. It eventually becomes too much for him to take. He then 
   rapes her and chokes her to death with his bare hands. The next time 
   we see Arturo, he is staying in an apartment owned by couple Ivano 
   (Fernando Rey), a paraplegic, and Olga (Olga Bisera). What Arturo 
   doesn't know is that he is being watched, as Ivano and Olga have the 
   apartment wired with cameras and microphones. They find Arturo an 
   &quot;interesting character&quot; and not only watch him for 
   scientific purposes (Ivano is some kind of famous psychologist), but 
   soon find their observations crossing into sexual territory (Ivano, 
   who is incapable of making love to Olga because of his disability, 
   feels her up while she watches Arturo exercising in the nude). Ivano 
   and Olga's butler, Ottavio (Jose Quaglio), is doing some watching of 
   his own, peeping through the keyhole as Olga takes a bath. He also 
   has a secret shrine to her in his closet and sniffs her hair in the 
   bathtub drain when she is done bathing. Olga catches him doing this 
   and slaps Ottavio in the face (&quot;Pig!&quot;), but says nothing 
   about it to Ivano (probably because she loves the attention). As 
   Ivano and Olga&nbsp; study Arturo deeper, they discover that he keeps <A HREF="eye_behind_the_wall_1977c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/eye behind the wall italian vhs front small2.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="184" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>to
    himself and doesn't leave the apartment often, so when Arturo does 
   finally go out one night, Olga follows him under the guise of 
   &quot;scientific study&quot; (That may be partly true, but she's got 
   the hots for him ever since she spotted his frank and beans!). She 
   follows him to a disco, where Arturo watches some muscular black dude 
   strip a white chick while they are dancing to a cheesy disco tune. 
   Surprisingly, Arturo brings the black dude back to the apartment, 
   where they smoke pot and engage in gay sex, all under the watchful 
   eyes of Ivano and Olga. Olga then become visibly upset and storms out 
   of the room, crying and yelling at Ivano that he knew Arturo was gay 
   all along. Ivano convinces her otherwise and they both decide to take 
   the experiment to a new level by introducing Olga into Arturo's life 
   to see if she can get Arturo to fall in love with her. It works all 
   too well and, after a short time, Ivano is watching Olga making love 
   to Arturo. This brings up painful memories to Ivano and, in 
   flashbacks, we learn that he caught his son making love to Olga. As 
   he was driving his son out of town, they got into a bad car accident, 
   which crippled Ivano and killed his son. The finale reveals hidden 
   family secrets and a strangely ironic (though fitting) demise for two 
   of the players.&nbsp; This strange, strange film, the only directing 
   and scripting credit for Giuliano Petrelli (who was a bit actor in a 
   few Italian films in the 70's, including <B><A HREF="action.htm#Manhunt1972">MANHUNT</A></B> 
   [1972]), is full of surprising scenes of both male and female nudity, 
   including full-frontal scenes from John Phillip Law. This film 
   equates sex and voyeurism as weapons, both physical and 
   psychological. When Olga catches Ottavio sniffing her drain hair 
   (ugh!), he retaliates by burning the shrine he had of her in a pile 
   of leaves outside and then rapes local village girl Lucille (Monica 
   Zanchi), knowing full well that Olga is watching him through a window 
   (and she acts hurt, like a little schoolgirl). As Ottavio is raping 
   Lucille, he screams at her, &quot;You keep your honor between your 
   legs!&quot;, but you really know he meant that remark for Olga. First 
   and foremost, this is a film about damaged people. No one in this 
   film can romotely be considered normal (even Lucille, who becomes 
   Ottavio's girlfriend!), so the problem with this film is deciding 
   which character to align yourself with. As the film progresses and 
   more information is revealed about each character (especially about 
   Olga and her relationship with Ivano), you will find yourself too 
   confused to pick a single character to sympathize with, but that's 
   not a bad thing. In the end, this is a film about confused human 
   beings that don't have the faintest idea on how to act human, thanks 
   to events in their pasts that drained them of their humanity. The 
   more they try to act normal, the worse it becomes for everyone. The 
   ending to this short (75 minute) film is a shocker and shows how 
   finally regaining your sanity and humanity doesn't mean things 
   necessarily turn out for the best. As in real life, the results can 
   be tragic. A perverse, undiscovered little gem. Also known as <B>THE

   hands a twisted mass of flesh, sealing his fate as an artist. He 
   plays a cat and mouse game with Dr. Carlyle (Matt McCoy), cutting off 
   any means of access or communication from his home and then 
   systematically makes life hell for the good doctor, his wife (Joanna

   After a little torture (including some well-placed bullet hits and

   during a raging thunderstorm. This run-of-the-mill suspenser is 
   enlivened a bit by some inventive photography and quick, jackhammer 
   MTV-style editing. The camera is always moving (giving the film a 
   nervous quality) and the film is full of short shock-cuts which makes 
   the film seem better than it really is. The main problem is the 
   screenplay. Too much talk, not enough action. As a villian, Lenny Von 
   Dohlen (<B><A HREF="blind_vision_1991.htm">BLIND VISION</A></B> -

   quite the electronics genius, as he rigged his car so that Frank 
   cannot get out so he can test out the snake's effectiveness on 
   humans. Frank is bitten and dies in less than a minute, which pleases 
   Gene. He then goes to the loft of Eva (Trudy Styler), his estranged 
   artist wife, and secretly tags her with mamba hormone and sets the 
   snake loose. He breaks off the key in the only door, cuts off her 
   phone to the outside (only he can call her) and waits outside in his 
   car, where he can track the snake and his wife electronically. Eva is 
   at first unaware that anything is wrong and goes about her business 
   as usual, taking a bath and practicing yoga, while the mamba stalks 
   her (cue distorted snake POV shots). While Eva is making a video 
   diary, the mamba strikes and misses. She doesn't even notice until 
   she plays back the tape and spots the snake. Now aware of the mamba, 
   Eva also realizes that both her door and phone are out of order. Not 
   able to escape, Eva must fight for survival while Gene calls her on 
   the phone every few minutes to see if she's still alive. Eva proves 
   to be quite the fighter, even as Gene cuts the electricity, forcing 
   her to fight in darkness. Eva gets wise to Gene's deadly game and 
   devises a way to get Gene into the loft, where she turns the tables 
   on him and gives him a taste of the mamba's venom.&nbsp; This tight 
   little thriller, directed and co-scripted by Mario Orfini (producer 
   of <B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#MorelsInvention1974">MOREL'S
    INVENTION</A></B> [1974] and director of <B><A HREF="jackpot_1992.htm">JACKPOT</A></B> 
   [1992]), is basically a two character stage play, as most of the 
   action takes place in Eva's loft or Gene's car. Gene has sixty 
   minutes for the mamba to kill Eva (that's how long the hormone is 
   effective) and the rest of the film plays out in real time, making it 
   urgent and suspenseful. Trudy Styler, better known as the activist 
   wife of rocker Sting, walks around most of the time in a tee shirt 
   and panties (there's also brief nudity during the bath scene), until 
   she discovers that the snake is present. Then, she covers-up herself 
   completely from head to toe and builds an impromptu fortress around 
   her to stop the snake. Styler keeps things moving at a brisk pace by 
   talking to herself, working her way out of tough situations by using 
   common sense and keeping a cool head. Gregg Henry (<B><A HREF="slither_2006.htm">SLITHER</A></B> 
   - 2006) doesn't have much to do but act slimy (the snake's got 
   nothing on him), look menacing and scowl when things don't go his 
   way, but that's OK because the real suspense here comes with Eva's 
   interaction with the snake and the inventive twist ending. Those 
   looking for blood and gore will be sorely disappointed here, as this 
   film gets it's thrills the old fashioned way: With tense situations

   by in a small boat, chases the frogman away, but he becomes 
   transfixed on a fish imprinted on Hilde's towel (for reasons we will

   Derek (Wal Davis; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#HorribleSexyVamp70">THE
    HORRIBLE SEXY VAMPIRE</A></B> - 1970), who happens to be in this 
   coastal town and is looking for his friend Zachary, whom he has known 
   for a long time. As he is trying to thumb a ride, Derek notices a 
   pretty young woman named Monica (Montserrat Prous; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DemonWitchChild1974">DEMON

   Mart&iacute;n) over money, so she drives away and picks up Derek. 
   Immediately, Monica (who is very wealthy) begins to come on to Derek, 
   gets a hotel room and fucks his brains out. Later that night, we see 
   someone wearing black gloves enter the hotel room and the next day, a 
   groggy Derek wakes up and discovers Monica dead in the bed beside 
   him, stabbed horribly in the heart by some unknown killer. A confused 
   Derek tries to figure out what is going on, but all he can remember 
   is that Monica was wearing a necklace shaped like a fish with eyes of 
   gold, which she is no longer wearing and it is nowhere in the hotel 
   room. Derek hears the sounds of police sirens, so he steals Monica's 
   car and drives to Zachary's house. Could this necklace be a major 
   clue in solving these murders? Damn right!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We are then introduced properly to Zachary and his wife Virginia 
   (Norma Kastel; <B><A HREF="vengeance_of_the_zombies_1972.htm">VENGEANCE
    OF THE ZOMBIES</A></B> - 1972), two wealthy artists who live in a 
   nice house in this beautiful coastal town (Zachary is known for 
   creating sculptures and paintings of fish). Zachary is worried about 
   being a witness to murder, saying he was once a witness to another 
   murder, but Virginia tells him not to worry, he is good friends with 
   the Commissioner (Barta Barri; <B><A HREF="#PeopleOwnDark1975">THE 
   PEOPLE WHO OWN THE DARK</A></B> - 1975) and the&nbsp; Commish will 
   make it easy for him. Zachary then has a flashback showing why he is 
   so transfixed with fish, relating them to death. When he was a young 
   boy, he saw his father murder his mother by viciously stabbing her 
   over and over with a very large knife while knocking over a fishbowl, 
   a young Zachary spying on his father and seeing the poor little fish 
   flopping away helplessly on the rug next to his mother's dead body. A 
   worried Derek then arrives at the Kendall household and tells Zachary 
   that he, too, was a witness to murder, but he believes since he is a 
   stranger in town, he will be accused of the crime. Zachary tells him 
   not to worry, the Commissioner is his friend and he will vouch for 
   Derek's innocence, since they have been friends for a long time. 
   Enter Marina (Ada Tauler; <B><A HREF="love_camp_1977.htm">LOVE CAMP</A></B> 
   - 1977, also starring Wal Davis), a pretty young woman who works at 
   the town's aquarium with her misogynistic, eternally-angry father 
   Pedro (Victor Israel; <B><A HREF="horror_express_1972.htm">HORROR EXPRESS</A></B> 
   - 1972), as she enters the Kendall home and it is pretty clear that 
   she and Derek will soon begin a romantic relationship over her 
   father's objections. Pedro doesn't trust Derek because he is a 
   &quot;foreigner&quot; and refuses to let his daughter associate with 
   such &quot;trash&quot; (Pedro only trusts his fish, telling Marina, 
   &quot;Only fish are loyal!&quot;). But, with women being women, 
   Marina can't help but fall in love with the handsome (but 
   awkward-looking) bell-bottomed Derek and they start a relationship. 
   What no one sees, however, is that the black-gloved killer is outside 
   the Kendall home with a high-powered rifle in hand. So why doesn't 
   the killer pull the trigger?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then discover that Marina once had a short relationship with 
   Marco, as have most wealthy women in this town. It seems Marco is 
   money hungry, wining and dining rich women, even Virginia (who admits 
   it to Derek, saying Zachary is more interested in his fish art than 
   her, so she found comfort with someone else, but other than that, she 
   and her husband have a solid relationship. Say what now?!?), and then 
   taking their money and moving onto the next wealthy woman. Marina 
   agrees to help Derek get the proof he needs to point the finger at 
   Marco as the killer, but the more Derek tries to prove himself 
   innocent, the guiltier he looks in the Commissioner's eyes, but the 
   Commish lets Derek walk freely around town as long as he doesn't 
   leave town. You see, the Commissioner likes Zachary and since Zachary 
   vouches for Derek, he defers to Zachary's opinion and lets Derek walk 
   around a free man, even though he believes he is the killer (You 
   know, just like any policeman would do...never!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Virginia tells Derek that she knows of the fish necklace with 
   the eyes of gold, since Zachary created a sculpture of it from a wood 
   carving he once purchased. She tells Derek that she sold the wood 
   carving to local jeweler Miguel Toledo (Gustavo Re; <B><A HREF="corruption_of_chris_miller_1973.htm">THE
    CORRUPTION OF CHRIS MILLER</A></B> - 1973) because he wanted to 
   create necklaces of the fish&nbsp; to sell to the tourists. When 
   Derek visits Pedro's jewelry store, he tells Derek that he hasn't 
   sold any of the fish necklaces yet since tourist season hasn't 
   started, but he did give one to Marco for a &quot;special 
   girlfriend&quot; he failed to name. Derek then phones Zachary, 
   telling him to come to town immediately, he has something very 
   important to tell him (One of the most basic giallo tropes. If it's 
   so important, why doesn't he tell him over the phone? Because the 
   film would end right there, that's why!). When Zachary picks up Derek 
   and they drive to the Commissioner's office, Derek tells him not to 
   worry, he will understand everything when he talks to the Commish. 
   Too bad that they never make it there, as someone cuts the brake line 
   on Zachary's car, forcing the car to go off an embankment in one of 
   the cheapest (and hilarious) car crashes ever put on film! 
   (Explaining it would not do it justice, you will have to see the film 
   to believe it!). Derek is thrown from the car, which rolls over and 
   catches on fire, but he is able to save Zachary, whose hands are 
   horribly burned, ruining Zachary's livelihood as an artist. Zachary 
   is quickly rushed to the hospital where a doctor informs Derek that 
   his friend will recover fully, but it will take some time and lots of 
   rehabilitation. A nameless nurse (Maria Elena Arpon; <B><A HREF="tombs_of_the_blind_dead_1972.htm">TOMBS
    OF THE BLIND DEAD</A></B> - 1972) in the hospital seems to know 
   Zachary all too well, as they have been having an illicit affair for 
   quite some time and Virginia secretly watches as her husband and 
   Nursey-Poo share a very passionate kiss.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The killer then murders a pretty young naked rich woman by stabbing 
   her in the shower of her hotel room. The Commissioner knows Marco 
   couldn't possibly be the killer because he was interrogating him&nbsp;
    at the time the woman was murdered. He has no other choice but to 
   set Marco free. The Commissioner turns to another detective and says, 
   &quot;The murderer seems to be obsessed with fish&quot;, a statement 
   that applies to almost everyone in this film. The nameless nurse 
   searches Zachary's home looking for something very important and when

   Commissioner of his innocence or will he take the fall for it all? 
   Just what does the fish necklace have to do with all this? We know 
   that Derek has a secret he is not telling Marina about, as he left 
   his job in London in a hurry just to visit Zachary and Virginia in 
   this small coastal town. Nearly everyone here has a reason for 
   killing, be it for love, money, hatred or illicit romances, so who 
   could it possibly be? If I told you, I would have to drive to your 
   home and kill you, but the clues to the killer's identity are in this 
   review. I will tell you this: The reveal reminds me of a certain 
   Dario Argento giallo film from the same time frame (Don't think of

   strange person in this flick, thanks to his weird eye and facial

   like to say more, but there just isn't a lot of information (and even

   (1983) -</B> In 1975, Calvin Duggai (Sonny Landham; <B><A HREF="predator_1987.htm">PREDATOR</A></B> 
   - 1987) deliberately abandoned five men to die in the desert because 
   of an argument involving tribal rivalry and the powers of Indian 
   witchcraft. Four psychiatrists testified Duggai was not capable of 
   distinguishing right from wrong and recommended he be 
   institutionalized. Well, Calvin (who is haunted by bad 'Nam

   get even with the four psychiatrists who put him there. Calvin 
   flags-down a pickup truck driven by Jim Brody (Robert Alan Brown) and

   them there (but not before taking a &quot;souvenir&quot; from each of 
   them, such as a lock of Sam's hair), telling them, &quot;I've had my 
   Hell. Now you'll have yours.&quot; When Shirley asks him what he is 
   going to do, Calvin replies, &quot;Nothing. The desert will do it for 
   me.&quot; Calvin breaks Earl's leg before he drives off and so begins 
   the long, torturous journey of the four psychiatrists (and the 
   audience), left barefoot, with no water and very little clothing in 
   what turns out to be one of the worst heat waves in many years. Sam 
   keeps his wits about him, digging a hole to keep cool and setting 
   Earl's broken leg with Shirley's help. He also fashions some tools 
   from spent rifle shells, which allows them to extract water and food 
   from cactus plants. Flashbacks reveal that once Sam and Shirley had 
   an illicit affair, which throws some unneeded tension between Sam and 
   Jay, but Sam's survival techniques keep everyone alive. Calvin goes 
   coo-coo for Cocoa Puffs and starts practicing witchcraft rituals and 
   doesn't like that his four captives are not moving, so he uses the 
   &quot;souvenirs&quot; he took from the group to exact revenge (he 
   feeds a falcon Sam's hair and the bird attacks Sam, inflicting deep 
   cuts on Sam's face and upper torso). Meanwhile, the psychiatrists all 
   have their own flashbacks, revealing vital information about their 
   lives and background (such as Sam's wife committing suicide). While 
   Sam is recuperating from his falcon wounds, Jay sets out on his own 
   to look for help and disappears. Sam eventually finds an injured Jay, 
   but Calvin shoots Jay dead and ties Sam to a boulder. Sam breaks free 
   and decides enough is enough. If he is going to save Shirley and 
   Earl, he is going to have to take-on Calvin mano-a-mano, but when he 
   captures Calvin, he decides not to kill him. He's going to send him 
   back to the asylum, because to Calvin, it's a fate worse than death.

   crazy Indian who believes he has supernatural powers (Which begs the 
   question: If he indeed has supernatural powers, why did it take him 
   nearly ten years to escape from the mental institution?) and a doctor 
   (Sam) who believes he can defeat him by using common human sense and 
   survival techniques. Not much happens throughout the film's entire

   this is happening to her or is it just a figment of her fragile 
   psyche? Before I get too far ahead of myself, let's get to the film 
   itself and start from the beginning.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The film opens with the lovely Minou (Lassander) taking a bath and 
   making resolutions (we hear her innermost thoughts). She resolves to 
   give up smoking, drinking and taking tranquilizers (&quot;Anyway, 
   they say it's bad for you to take them if you drink.&quot;). She's 
   making all of these resolutions for her new husband Peter (<A HREF="late_breaking_news_page_3.htm#PierPaoloCapponi">Pier
    Paolo Capponi</A>: <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SevenBloodOrchids72">SEVEN
    BLOOD-STAINED ORCHIDS</A></B> - 1972) to &quot;make him happy.&quot; 
   She's really doing all this to make her absentee husband jealous (She 
   decides to eat out tonight and tell Peter that a &quot;friend&quot; 
   invited her to dinner.). Peter is once again away on business and is 
   not due back until tomorrow night. Minou thinks, &quot;When you 
   return tomorrow night, I won't let you make love to me right away. 
   I'll say that I've fallen in love with another man and that we have 
   to get a divorce. But we can still be friends. Then, after you make a 
   terrible scene...hmmm.&quot; It's quite obvious Minou loves Peter, as 
   she changes clothes and applies makeup with a framed photo of Peter 
   by her side. She then pours herself a drink, lights a cigarette and 
   pops a couple of tranquilizers, swearing to herself that it is the 
   last of them she will ever do. It is also obvious Minou has no 
   willpower at all (Hey, I gave up all three at the same time! True story.).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Minou then takes a nighttime stroll down the beach, not noticing 
   that a man on a motorcycle (Simon Andreu; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#BloodSpatBride1972">THE
    BLOOD SPATTERED BRIDE</A></B> - 1972; billed here as the 
   &quot;Blackmailer&quot;, so that is what I will call him) is 
   following her. He pulls up beside her and then rides circles around 
   her, forcing Minou to run into a boatyard. The Blackmailer finds a 
   way down to the boatyard, gets off his motorcycle and chases Minou 
   through the boatyard. &quot;What do you want here?&quot; asks Minou. 
   &quot;You!&quot; says the Blackmailer, pulling out a cane from under 
   his jacket. The Blackmailer taunts Minou, laughing as he gets closer 
   to her. There's a retractable blade at the end of his cane, which he 
   throws at Minou, purposely missing her and sticking into the hull of 
   a boat. &quot;It's no use, Minou. You can't escape from me!&quot; 
   says the Blackmailer, continuing with, &quot;No, I'm not going to use 
   force with you. I want you to beg me. I want you to plead for my 
   kisses. Plead! You will!&quot; Minou doesn't know what to do, as the 
   Blackmailer knows her name, but she has no idea who he is. He then 
   runs the blade of his cane across the front of Minou's body, cutting 
   the laces of her dress one-by-one that line her bosom. He says that 
   he knows Minou and asks her if she knows what her husband has been up 
   to while he's been away. Minou wants to know what Peter has to do 
   with him, telling the Blackmailer to quit tormenting her. The 
   Blackmailer calls Peter a &quot;fraud&quot; and a &quot;murderer&quot;
    and then tells Minou she can go...for now. He gets on his motorcycle 
   and leaves, Minou uncertain by what has just transpired.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next night, Minou phones Peter at a bar and tells him to meet 
   her there, she is too afraid to go home and be by herself (she then 
   orders two brandies for herself from the bartender).&nbsp; Minou then 
   sits with two men playing cards, complete strangers, and waits for 
   Peter to arrive, having a bottle of beer with the strangers. When 
   Peter arrives (There are now six empty bottles of beer next to 
   Minou!), he peers at Minou through a fractured hole in the glass of 
   the bar's front window and calls out her name (How's that for 
   symbolism?). Once they are home, Minou tells Peter what the 
   Blackmailer did (and didn't) do to her, yet she fails to mention to 
   Peter that he called him a fraud and a murderer. Peter wants to call 
   the police, but Minou says no, all they'll do is make them sign 
   forms, so Peter says fine, it's up to her. Minou then asks Peter that 
   if the Blackmailer raped her, would he still love her? Peter answers, 
   &quot;Why on earth would I love you less because of a sex 
   fiend?&quot;, mentioning it would be quite a different answer if she 
   had a lover. &quot;Now I know how much your love means to me&quot;, 
   says Minou. &quot;Better late than never&quot; replies Peter. Why 
   would he say such an awful thing?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Minou in a disco (Remember when women went to discos 
   wearing outrageous wigs? Either do I.) with Peter's co-worker George 
   (Salvador Buguet, in his only film), who tells Minou that Peter just 
   called and he will be here later. Minou's best friend Dominique 
   (Scott) and her boyfriend of the moment join Minou and George on the 
   dance floor and exchange partners (Dominique seems to be enjoying 
   herself a little too much). Back at the table, Dominique mentions to 
   Minou that their friend, financier Jean Dubois, killed himself. He 
   was found drowned in the river, the police believe he jumped off a 
   bridge. Minou thinks back to what the Blackmailer said to her, 
   calling Peter a murderer. Jean Dubois' death makes the front pages of 
   the newspapers, where Minou reads that Dubois' &quot;death was due to 
   an embolism commonly called 'the bends', a condition which is 
   generally caused when a prolonged deep immersion is followed by a 
   rapid surfacing without allowing sufficient time for decompression. 
   The doctors have been unable to explain how this <A HREF="forbidden_photos_of_a_lady_above_suspicion_1970.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/forbidden photos of a lady above suspicion italy poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="213" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>occurred
    in the victim&quot; (This is important, so remember it!). Minou 
   can't get this story out of her mind, especially when Peter mentions 
   that he owed Dubois a large sum of money. Minou tells Peter that he 
   will still have to pay Jean's heirs the money and Peter says yes, but 
   he will find a way to delay the payment. Peter then tells Minou that 
   he won't be home for dinner, he has to work late at the office. Minou 
   wishes that they would spend more time together and tries to make 
   Peter jealous by saying she is going to phone Dominique and go out 
   with her tonight, telling Peter that he knows Dominique better than 
   anyone and what she is capable of doing (she's kind of whorish). That 
   night, Minou tells Dominique about the Blackmailer and how he nearly 
   raped her (Dominique says, &quot;I'd have adored being violated!&quot;
    I told you she was whorish!), also telling her how he called Peter a 
   murderer. Dominique tells her that if she sees the Blackmailer again 
   to tell Peter nothing or he'll start wondering what she is up to (She 
   also tells Minou not to worry about what the Blackmailer said about 
   her husband, because &quot;What possible secrets could Peter be 
   hiding from you?&quot; I was wondering the same thing!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Dominique takes Minou back to her place, where she shows her a 
   slideshow of a naked Dominique (yowza!) in near pornographic photos. 
   Minou asks her who took the photos and Dominique responds a 
   photographer, Minou doesn't know him, but &quot;he certainly knows 
   how to use his equipment.&quot; Minou then asks what would happen if 
   the photographer sold the photos? &quot;That would be great! What 
   publicity! Can't you just see the line-up?&quot; says Dominique, 
   laughing. Dominique then shows Minou a series of very pornographic 
   photos she purchased by mail from Copenhagen. One photo gets Minou's 
   attention. It is a photo of a naked woman in bed with the 
   Blackmailer. Dominique lets Minou keep the photo when she asks to 
   borrow it, not telling Dominique that the man in the photo is the 
   Blackmailer (We also discover that Dominique introduced Minou to 
   Peter, because he wasn't Dominique's &quot;type&quot;. Minou asks 
   Dominique if she ever slept with Peter and her answer is quite elusive.).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Peter calls his friend Frank (Osvaldo Genazzani; <B><A HREF="night_of_the_scorpion_1972.htm">NIGHT
    OF THE SCORPION</A></B> - 1972), the Commissioner of Police, to sit 
   down with him and Minou to discuss the Blackmailer nearly sexually 
   assaulting her. Frank tells Minou not to worry, sex maniacs usually 
   never go after the same woman twice, but if she sees him again to 
   phone him and he will take care of it, handing her his business card. 
   When Frank leaves, Minou can see Peter is worried and asks him what 
   is wrong. He tells her his business has a lot of problems, 
   development cost have skyrocketed and creditors are pressuring him 
   (Peter's company is developing a new counter-pressure gauge that will 
   revolutionize skin diving.). When Minou asks him if one of the 
   creditors was the deceased Jean Dubois, Peter becomes a little 
   unhinged, not answering her question and asking why she has to 
   mention Dubois' name in every conversation they have. When Minou 
   leaves his office, Peter makes a phone call to Dominique (a 
   conversation we are not privy to). While Minou is walking out of the 
   business with George (he tells her that Jean Dubois dying saved the 
   company because Dubois was a despicable loanshark), she stops to 
   watch a man using the company's new decompression chamber, George 
   telling her that he is testing out the company's new revolutionary 
   gauge. Minou now believes, and many may say rightfully so, that Peter 
   is a murderer, especially when the Blackmailer phones her at 2:00 am 
   that night and plays a recording of Peter saying to a co-worker to 
   take jean Dubois out of the decompression chamber and throw him in 
   the river to make it look like a suicide. The Blackmailer tells Minou 
   that if she doesn't come to see him tomorrow, he will turn over the 
   tape to the police. When Peter asks her who was on the phone, Minou 
   tells him it was a drunk Dominique, which may not be the best lie she 
   has told to her husband.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    She meets the Blackmailer at his apartment the next day and asks him 
   how much he wants, pulling out $1,000 in cash from her purse and 
   handing it to him. He throws the money into the air, saying, &quot;You
    think you can buy me with your paper money?&quot; He makes Minou 
   undress, telling her she is going to beg for his love. We don't see 
   what happens next until the end, when the Blackmailer unties the 
   bonds that hold Minou to his bed (his bedroom is full of white 
   plaster casts of human hands, giving the room a very eerie glow) and 
   hands her the cassette tape of the recording, saying she deserves it, 
   but her husband doesn't. When Minou gets home, Peter wants to know 
   where she has been and she says she was with Dominique, only Peter 
   reveals that Dominique has been in their home for a long time 
   (Dominique is quick on her feet and makes up an excuse for Minou, but 
   is it only for show?). That night, Minou has a nightmare, showing us 
   what the Blackmailer did to her while she was tied to his bed, 
   slapping her in the face and being physically and sexually abusive to 
   her. Minou wakes up screaming and then begs Peter to never leave her.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    While Peter is away on business, the Blackmailer pays Minou a visit 
   to her home and gives her pornographic photos of him making love to 
   her, telling her he is a photographer by trade and he took photos of 
   them making love the night before. He also tells her that the 
   recording is a phony, he simply disguised his voice and pretended to 
   be Peter just to get these photos of her. He tells Minou she is now 
   his slave and if she doesn't want Peter to see these photos, she will 
   give in to his sexual advances, which she does, making violent love 
   to him. We then discover that the Blackmailer is Dominique's 
   boyfriend (no surprise there), but is this a blackmail attempt for a 
   large sum of money or are there far more nefarious plans afoot? 
   That's all I am going to tell you, but, as always, all the clues to 
   unlocking this mystery are in this review, so re-read it and see if 
   you can solve it.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   films, co-written with Gastaldi), was basically unheard of in the 
   United States until Blue Underground released it on DVD. It then 
   became a cult item among giallo fans, thanks to the copious nudity by 
   Dagmar Lassander (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#WerewolfWoman1976">WEREWOLF
    WOMAN</A></B> - 1976) and Susan Scott (<B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#EmanuelleCannibal77">EMANUELLE
    AND THE LAST CANNIBALS</A></B> - 1977). Unlike most giallo films 
   from this period, there is precious little blood or graphic violence, 
   but the fact is this film doesn't need it, because this is a 
   psychosexual thriller where<A HREF="forbidden_photos_of_a_lady_above_suspicion_1970.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/forbidden photos of a lady above suspicion blu-ray front3a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="261" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="1"></A> 
   violence (with the exception of sexual violence) has no place. The 
   only violence done here (besides the finale) is the kind that doesn't 
   leave bruises or any other physical traces. It's being done to 
   Minou's mind. This film is also very misogynistic in the way it 
   treats women (a common trait in Italian genre films from this 
   period), as the characters are either selfish (Peter), into violent 
   sex (the Blackmailer) or will take sex any way they can get it 
   (Dominique), even if it means betraying best friend Minou, who has no 
   idea what she is up against or how to deal with it. This film is also 
   very sensual, as Lassander and Scott parade around naked or in 
   various stages of undress, making this a treat for fans of female 
   flesh (and who isn't?). That is why this film works, as Lassander 
   bares her soul (and so much more) in her role as Minou, making her 
   very sympathetic with audiences. When she believes her husband is 
   guilty of murder, she still protects him, because, to her, love is 
   more important than guilt. Every husband would be proud to have her 
   as a wife. As Dominique, Susan Scott is the complete opposite of 
   Minou in every way and when she tells Minou she would 
   &quot;adore&quot; being raped by a stranger, we begin to understand 
   why they are best friends (It is true, opposites do attract). They 
   feed off each other's experiences, because they know they can never 
   be like each other, it's not in their genetic makeup to act like 
   that, so they live vicariously over their best friend's exploits. 
   That's what makes this film so special with audiences. It's a 
   psychological thriller first and foremost and then a giallo film, 
   making it a unique, well-acted experience for viewers who appreciate 
   something a little different, so I recommend this film wholeheartedly.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Argento's hardest to find (at least in the United States), so when I 
   found a print streaming on Amazon Prime (and I had to pay for it, 
   even though I am a Prime member), I just had to review it since I am re-evaluating
    my opinion about Argento, finding some of his films, which I was 
   ambivalent about (including this film), now satisfy my adult sensibilities.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    - Present]; George Carlin and Ringo Starr, as well as Alec Baldwin, 
   were previous narrators on the series) is a drummer in a rock band 
   who is being stalked by a mysterious man in a black hat and 
   sunglasses. While recording in a studio, Roberto is annoyed to see 
   the stalker staring at him through a window (Roberto is also annoyed 
   by a mosquito flying in his face, so he kills it with the snare 
   cymbals and smiles). After the session is over he sees the stalker 
   again and decides to follow him, almost losing him on the dark Rome 
   streets, but corners him in an empty abandoned theater. He grabs the 
   stalker's arm, demanding to know why he is following him. The stalker 
   says he has no idea what Roberto is talking about, which makes 
   Roberto furious (&quot;What do you want? What is your trip?&quot; 
   says Roberto to the stalker, exposing the film's early-'70s roots). 
   Roberto knocks the sunglasses off the stalker's face, so the stalker 
   yells, &quot;Lay off me!&quot; and pulls out a switchblade, 
   threatening Roberto with it. Roberto tries to take the blade away 
   from the stalker and both lose their balance, the knife going into 
   the stalker's stomach and he falls into the orchestra pit, dead. 
   Roberto then sees <A HREF="four_flies_on_grey_velvet_1971_baby_mask_photo.htm">someone
    wearing a baby mask</A> in one of the balconies is taking his 
   picture, snapping away with a camera, taking photos of the accidental 
   death. As we all know, when photos are viewed out of context, they 
   don't tell the whole story and many times they can make an innocent 
   person look guilty. Roberto doesn't know it yet, but his life is 
   about to take a dangerous turn, far more dangerous than simply having 
   a stalker following him. It's about to turn deadly.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Roberto goes home to his wife, Nina (Mimsy Farmer; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Autopsy1973">AUTOPSY</A></B> 
   - 1973), but he can't sleep, lying in bed wide-awake (He tells Nina 
   nothing about what just happened to him). The phone rings in the 
   middle of the night, waking Nina up, but when she answers it, no one 
   is on the line. Nina notices that Roberto is awake, but he still says 
   nothing to her, except wanting to know whom the call was from, Nina 
   telling him it must have been a wrong number. We then see the 
   baby-masked photographer developing the negatives and they, indeed, 
   make Roberto look guilty of murder. The following morning, Roberto 
   reads an article in the newspaper (The headline reads &quot;Cadavere 
   di uno sconosciuto trovato nel flume&quot; which translates to 
   &quot;Corpse of a stranger found in the flume&quot;) and is so caught 
   up with what is happening in his life, he doesn't hear Nina say 
   goodbye, as she heads off to go shopping, their maid, Amelia (Marisa 
   Fabbri; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#WeekendMurders1970">WEEKEND MURDERS</A></B> 
   - 1970), saying goodbye to her instead. Nina meets neighbor Maria 
   (Costanza Spadi) and she is chewing out the mailman (Gildo Di Marco; <B><A HREF="his_name_was_holy_ghost_1972.htm">HIS
    NAME WAS HOLY GHOST</A></B> - 1972) for delivering a crippled 
   neighbor's mail. Maria tells Nina that the neighbor, Rimbaldi 
   (Guerrino Crivello; <B><A HREF="my_dear_killer_1972.htm">MY DEAR KILLER</A></B> 
   - 1972), gets a lot of Swedish pornography in the mail and she is 
   sick and tired of having to deliver it to him (The mailman makes a 
   comment to Maria, telling her that she should walk in his shoes for a 
   day to see how easy it is to get someone else's mail). Roberto then 
   is handed an envelope at the studio, his name and address written on 
   it, looking like it was written by a child. Inside the envelope is 
   the dead stalker's passport, nothing else, and now Roberto knows the 
   name of the man he &quot;killed&quot;. At a party at Roberto's house, 
   bandmate Mirko (Fabrizio Moroni; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#MurderObsession1981">MURDER
    OBSESSION</A></B> - 1981) tells a story about a beheading of a thief 
   that he saw in Saudi Arabia. Another bandmate, Andrea (Stefano Satta 
   Flores: <B><A HREF="salon_kitty_1976.htm">SALON KITTY</A></B> - 
   1976), tells a story about a funeral for a famous French chef, where 
   the mourners sprinkle parsley and paprika on the chef in his open 
   coffin. Everyone laughs except for Roberto. Death is no longer funny 
   to him. Roberto looks through a stack of his music albums and 
   discovers one of the photos the mysterious baby-masked photographer 
   took, showing Roberto holding the bloody switchblade while the 
   stalker falls into the orchestra pit. Roberto tries to take and hide 
   the photo unnoticed, but Amelia sees him doing it, a look of 
   disapproval on her face (Hey, all this trivia is important, so pay 
   attention!). Even the cat sees him doing it, which Roberto does 
   notice. That night, Roberto has a nightmare where a man is about to 
   be beheaded by an executioner with a sword in Saudi Arabia, as a 
   throng of onlookers watch. Just as the sword is about to behead the 
   man, Roberto wakes up, sweating and trembling, yet his wife sleeps 
   soundly next to him. Roberto then hears the sound of a human heart 
   beating, gets out of bed and goes to investigate, finding that the 
   light switch doesn't work in the living room. The cat hisses at him 
   and, suddenly, the baby-masked photographer puts a rope around 
   Roberto's neck and pulls it tighter, whispering, &quot;I could kill 
   you, but I won't. I'll wait. Who's going to help you? The police, 
   perhaps? You can't tell anyone. You're all alone.&quot; The 
   blackmailer then releases a choking Roberto and disappears into the 
   darkness. It is at this time we begin to ask ourselves why this is 
   happening to Roberto. Is he being blackmailed for money or does the 
   blackmailer have more personal reasons for doing this? An even better 
   question to ask is this: Does Roberto know the real reason he is 
   being blackmailed and he's not telling anyone?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Nina wakes up and wants to know what is bothering Roberto. He breaks 
   down and tells her everything, about killing a man a couple of days 
   ago and everything that has happened since, unaware that Amelia is 
   listening to their conversation. When Roberto goes to show Nina all 
   the evidence the blackmailer sent him, he discovers it is all missing 
   from his desk drawer. Nina tells Roberto she doesn't believe him, 
   telling him it was probably a bad dream and he should talk to a 
   psychiatrist, which infuriates Roberto. Nina then asks Roberto the 
   name of the man he killed and he tells her his name was &quot;Carlo 
   Morosi&quot;. Nina tells Roberto she found a bloodstained 
   handkerchief with the initials &quot;C.M.&quot; on it and when 
   Roberto asks her where she found it, she tells him on the top of her 
   bedroom dresser and begins to cry. Roberto comforts her and says, 
   &quot;What are we going to do?&quot; Nina says, &quot;Let's run away. 
   Let's get away from here. It's the only way.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Before making such a rash decision, Roberto decides to visit hulking 
   friend Godfried (Bud Spencer; <B><A HREF="they_call_me_trinity_1970.htm">THEY
    CALL ME TRINITY</A></B> - 1970), whom Roberto jokingly calls 
   &quot;God&quot;, because he can practically fix any sticky situation 
   (When Roberto yells &quot;God! God, where are you?&quot; we hear a 
   church choir sing &quot;Hallelujah&quot; just before we see Godfried).<A HREF="four_flies_on_grey_velvet_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/four flies on grey velvet poster18 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Roberto tells Godfried everything that is happening to him (Godfried 
   has a pet parrot named &quot;Jerkoff&quot; who keeps interrupting 
   their conversation!), even accusing his bandmates of being in on it. 
   Godfried tells him to hire private detective Gianni Arrosio to snoop 
   around and protect him and to get &quot;The Professor&quot; to watch 
   his house. The Professor (Oreste Lionello; <B><A HREF="#CaseOfTheBloodyIris">THE
    CASE OF THE BLOODY IRIS</A></B> - 1971) is a part-time drunk who 
   lives on Godfried's property, but Godfried tells Roberto that he is 
   good at his job, so Roberto brings him back, the Professor watching 
   his home, making sure no one pays unwanted visits.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Roberto becomes paranoid and, in the pouring rain, he hits someone 
   wearing a parka over their head with a pipe for getting too close to 
   his house. It turns out to be the mailman (!), who has a special 
   delivery letter for Roberto. We then watch as Amelia blackmails 
   someone over a pay phone, telling the person, &quot;I'm no fool. 
   Besides all the evidence I got here, I saw you. Look, I don't care 
   why you are doing it, I'm only interested in the money.&quot; She 
   tells the person to meet her in the park this afternoon and they 
   better bring the money (In one of Argento's patented tracking shots 
   [but not in one take], we follow the pay phone's cable from the phone 
   booth to the phone company's switchboard to the baby-masked 
   blackmailer's home). The blackmailer then has a flashback where 
   he/she is in a padded cell in a straightjacket hearing their father 
   say, &quot;Stop acting like a baby! I never want to see you cry!&quot;
    as the camera pans 360&#176; around the padded cell (I guess we know 
   why the blackmailer wears a baby mask!). We then see Amelia waiting 
   on a park bench for the blackmailer to arrive. I think we know this 
   is not going to end well. When the blackmailer doesn't arrive at the 
   appointed time (It is now nighttime), Amelia walks, and then runs, 
   out of the park, sensing that someone is following her. She ends up 
   in a severely narrow alleyway with a tall wall blocking her way. She 
   screams for help and a couple on the other side of the wall hears 
   her, but the man tells her that the wall is too high to climb, she 
   will have to wait until he can find another way to help her. It's too 
   late to save her anyway, as we watch Amelia's fingernails break as 
   she claws at the wall, the blackmailer killing her.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Roberto has another party at his home, the same people there that 
   were at the first party, the only exception being Dalia (Francine 
   Racette; <B><A HREF="disappearance_1977.htm">THE DISAPPEARANCE</A></B> 
   - 1977) and Roberto doesn't look happy to see her. Nina informs him 
   that Amelia is missing and she is also not a happy person, but Andrea 
   is there, telling the group another &quot;funny&quot; story, this one 
   about Baron Frankenstein and his queer (as in gay) Monster, who rapes 
   the Baron. As before, everyone laughs except for Roberto. The police 
   then phone the house and tell Nina that Amelia has been found with 
   her throat cut and could she come to the station tomorrow morning to 
   identify the body. That night, Roberto has the nightmare again where 
   the executioner in Saudi Arabia is about to lop off a man's head, 
   only this time it gets really close to the man losing his head before 
   Roberto wakes up. He hears the cat hissing and knows that someone is 
   in the house, but he stays in bed. The next morning, he finds a note 
   taped to the door that reads &quot;E Stato Facile&quot; (&quot;It was 
   easy&quot;) and Nina tells him, &quot;I'm scared. They're out to get 
   us and it's not blackmail. They want to kill us!&quot; (The Professor 
   finds their cat dead). Nina becomes more paranoid than Roberto, 
   giving him a choice: Either they leave the house and never come back 
   or Roberto tells the police everything.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then find out that Carlo Morosi (Calisto Calisti; <B><A HREF="adios_sabata_1970.htm">ADIOS,
    SABATA</A></B> - 1970) is actually alive, talking to the blackmailer 
   and giving a &quot;toy&quot; back: A switchblade with a retractable 
   blade that squirts blood. Carlo is disgusted with the blackmailer, 
   saying that murder was never a part of the plan and even killing 
   Roberto's cat was going too far. Carlo wants to be paid and forget 
   about the whole thing, only the blackmailer is not so forgiving, 
   bashing Carlo repeatedly in the head with a full bottle of champagne 
   and finishing him off by strangling him with a metal coat hanger, 
   twisting it tight around his neck until Carlo lets out a death throttle.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Roberto finally meets private investigator Gianni Arrosio 
   (Jean-Pierre Marielle; <B><A HREF="da_vinci_code_2006.htm">THE DA 
   VINCI CODE</A></B> - 2006), who is gay (How do we know he is gay? He 
   asks Roberto, &quot;Have you ever had a homosexual 
   experience?&quot;!). He is not only gay, he has a voracious appetite 
   and is always hungry. He tells Roberto that he has never solved a 
   case (!), but he feels lucky today, saying, &quot;Statistically 
   speaking, one of the most impressive records of failure is destined 
   to be broken. 84 failures, a record like that couldn't possibly 
   last!&quot; (He seems very proud of his failures). For some reason, 
   Roberto hires him on the spot and the limp-wristed Arrosio says to 
   him, &quot;I will take a very personal interest in your case.&quot; 
   Arrosio starts asking Roberto some very personal questions and we 
   discover that Nina was left a very large inheritance, but Roberto 
   doesn't like talking about it because his rock band makes very little 
   money and he survives on his wife's money. Arrosio tells Roberto that 
   he won't realize he's around and if he needs any further information, 
   he'll contact him by phone. As Roberto is walking toward his home, 
   the Professor tells him to get lost, Nina has been talking to the 
   police for a long time. Before he can turn around, Nina walks out of 
   the house with Police Commissioner Peeny (Tom Felleghy; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#DamnedInVenice1978">DAMNED
    IN VENICE</A></B> - 1978), so Roberto walks towards them. Nina tells 
   Roberto that she is going to the police station with Peeny to talk 
   about Amelia, but when she is done, she is not coming home, she needs 
   to get away from it all. Roberto tells her he is staying home and 
   sticking it out because it is better than going to prison. Yes, 
   Roberto's life is crumbling all around him, but what can he do to 
   stop it? (Especially when Nina refuses to kiss him goodbye, turning 
   her head and walking away). With Nina now gone, Delia shows up and 
   tells Roberto that Nina told her everything because she had no one 
   else to talk to. She tries to console Roberto by giving him a bath 
   (!) and massaging his neck while he sits naked in the bathtub. Of 
   course, this leads to a lovemaking session in the tub. Roberto has 
   the Saudi Arabia nightmare again, only this time a naked Dalia wakes 
   him up and they make love again. Arrosio then phones Roberto to tell 
   him he saw a &quot;strange physical resemblance&quot; in one of the 
   photos Roberto gave him, but he doesn't tell Roberto who he is 
   talking about, saying it may be hereditary, but he'll tell him who at 
   another time. He also tells Roberto that he won't hear from him for a 
   few days and asks him if this name rings a bell: &quot;Villa 
   Rapidi&quot;. Roberto says no and Arrosio hangs up before he can ask 
   him why. It turns out that Villa Rapidi is a mental institution and 
   we see Arrosio talking to a psychiatrist at the institution about 
   some unknown person, the psychiatrist telling him that the patient 
   was there for three years, the person suffering from paranoia and an 
   extreme case of homicidal mania. The psychiatrist also tells Arrosio 
   that after the patient's father died, all the symptoms of emotional 
   disturbance disappeared and the patient was completely cured. He has 
   one more point to add. He suspected that the man was not the 
   patient's real father. Think you know who it is? All the clues are in 
   this review, so dust off your magnifying glass, inject yourself with 
   a seven per cent solution and start deducing.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This is one of Dario Argento's least talked about films in his canon 
   (just like <B><A HREF="two_evil_eyes_1990.htm">TWO EVIL EYES</A></B> 
   - 1990 and <B><A HREF="trauma_1992.htm">TRAUMA</A></B> - 1992) and I 
   really don't know why. I heard and read many complaints saying that 
   this film is &quot;too dated' and contains &quot;too much humor&quot;,
    but those two points don't bother me at all. What film made in the 
   early-'70s doesn't look dated? If it weren't a period piece or a 
   western, of course it will seem dated, but I look past all that and 
   enjoy the film for its story, not the hairstyles, clothing or slang 
   that place it in that time period. As for the humor, what can I say, 
   Argento always placed humor in his films, sometimes overt and 
   sometimes well hidden. The humor here comes mainly from the mailman 
   (who always carries a pipe, just in case Roberto attacks him again) 
   and Arrosio (Jean Pierre Marielle decided to make his character gay, 
   even though it wasn't written that way. Argento agreed and Marielle 
   ad-libbed many of his lines), but you won't be laughing when you see 
   how the blackmailer kills Arrosio, telling him, &quot;You guessed 
   right&quot; just before injecting him with an air embolism directly 
   into his heart. There is much to enjoy here, such as Argento's 
   flourishes with the camera, giving us some very weird POV shots, his 
   use of sound to make us jump (such a a phone ringing in a dark room) 
   and the story itself (screenplay by Argento, from a story by himself, 
   Mario Foglietti and Luigi Cozzi [director/writer of <B><A HREF="#KillerMustKillAgain">THE
    KILLER MUST KILL AGAIN</A></B> - 1973 and <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Contamination1980">CONTAMINATION</A></B> 
   - 1980]), where Argento keeps throwing us a left when we are 
   expecting a right, such as letting us believe Dalia is the killer, 
   only to have her murdered by the real killer. This leads to a very 
   strange and quite unbelievable plot twist, where a doctor tells the 
   police and Roberto that the retina of the eye contains the last image 
   the person saw before dying, so they check Dalia's retina and come up 
   with an image that looks like four flies (hence the title). As I 
   said, quite unbelievable, but somehow Argento gets it to work, just 
   like he did with the finale of <B><A HREF="bird_with_the_crystal_plumage_1970.htm">THE
    BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE</A></B> (1970) and <B><A HREF="deep_red_1976.htm">DEEP

   system, but some people just aren't able to do that, not 
   understanding that nearly every other <A HREF="four_flies_on_grey_velvet_1971.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/four flies on grey velvet italy poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>giallo
    film asks the same thing from you. This is the main difference 
   between a giallo film and a murder mystery. Murder mysteries want you 
   to think logically, but giallo films don't necessarily want you to do 
   that. Realize that and you'll become a giallo fan, too, just like me. 
   While this is not my favorite giallo film (that would be <B><A HREF="#Torso1973">TORSO</A></B> 
   - 1973), it ranks up there in my top twenty. This film offers many 
   surprises to the viewer and all it asks of you is just to go along 
   for the ride (Some of the surprises include Roberto realizing the man 
   being beheaded in his nightmares is actually him; the &quot;four 
   flies&quot; image being a clever revelation to Roberto; and the 
   killer meeting a fitting end, another one of Argento's fabulous 
   camera flourishes. He had to destroy ten cars to get the shot that he 
   wanted.). This film also originated the &quot;bullet time&quot; shot 
   made famous in the <B><A HREF="matrix_trilogy_1999-2003.htm">MATRIX</A></B> trilogy.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   MOSCHE DI VELUTTO GRIGIO</A></B> (&quot;Four Patches of Grey 
   Velvet&quot;), this film received a U.S. theatrical release from 
   Paramount Pictures, albeit in an edited version in order to obtain a 
   PG Rating, missing the nudity, the beheading and some footage in the 
   closing minutes. Strangely, it never received a legitimate VHS 
   release in the United States, Paramount refusing to license it to 
   anyone for reasons still unknown. The first time it appeared on home 
   video in the States was 2009, when Mya Communications <A HREF="four_flies_on_grey_velvet_1971.htm#MYA">released
    it on DVD</A>. I remember the uproar it caused in fan circles, who 
   complained that the sound was warbled and then taking the Mya print 
   and releasing it on torrent sites with the sound supposedly 
   &quot;fixed&quot;. It was also supposedly cut, something I was not 
   able to confirm, as the Mya disc went out of print almost as soon as 
   it hit the market, people screaming for their money back (after 
   making copies for themselves, that is). The streaming version on 
   Amazon Prime, which is not free to Prime members (it will cost you 
   $1.99 to watch it) is the uncut version in a beautiful widescreen 
   (not anamorphic) print, restoring all the nudity and violence with 
   one caveat: even though it is uncut, some scenes are in Italian, but 
   there are no English subtitles. So brush up on your Italian, because 
   there is a conversation in the final minutes that should really be 
   subtitled (It is important to the plot, explaining the killer's 
   motive). It's a small, but legitimate, complaint but it does not ruin 
   the film. I just wish that some enterprising company (C'mon Synapse 
   Films or Blue Underground!) would release this on disc with all the 
   bells and whistles. It's bound to be a big seller. Also starring Aldo

   His sweet old Aunt Lucy (Flora Robson; <B><A HREF="beast_in_the_cellar_1970.htm">THE
    BEAST IN THE CELLAR</A></B> - 1970) agrees to financially back him 
   in his endeavors, but when she is found brutally murdered in some 
   Pompeii ruins by a British tour group, Tim puts his book on hold and 
   tries to solve her murder. It won't be easy for Tim, because his drug 
   and criminal background (he was no angel during his younger years) 
   also makes him a prime suspect to the Italian police. Once back in 
   Britain, he joins forces with fianc&eacute;e and soon-to-be-wife

    was killed by a burglar and, ever since that day, Lucy went out of 
   her way to help young criminals turn their life around (Mr. Vellacot 
   believes Lucy helped approximately 25 to 30 men walk the 
   straight-and-narrow). On his way back from the retirement home, Tim 
   meets a strange lady on a train (who Tim later describes as &quot;a 
   pathetic old dyke with a face like a bun&quot;) and she gives him an 
   envelope (which Tim initially thinks is a religious pamphlet), 
   telling him not to open it until he gets home. It turns out not to be 
   a religious pamphlet at all, but a thinly-veiled threat telling him 
   to stop investigating Lucy's death. Tim begins to doubt his own 
   sanity when his tape-recorded notes contain devious laughter that 
   seems to be in his own voice and he discovers that the threatening 
   note could only have come from his typewriter (it has a distinctively 
   flawed &quot;I&quot; key). Is it possible that Tim is back to abusing 
   drugs or is all this some elaborate setup to blame Tim for Lucy's 
   death? It doesn't take a genius (or does it?) to recognize that Tim 
   is being unfairly accused of a bunch of crimes he didn't commit, 
   including making an indecent proposal to the old dyke on the train 
   (she files a complaint with the police). Police Sgt. Matthews (Derek 
   Newark) believes Tim is madder than a hatter, as Tim complains he is 
   receiving threatening phone calls from a mysterious man (&quot;I am 
   7, 70, and 700!&quot;) telling him to lay-off the investigation and 
   that he is constantly being watched. This all begins to worry Juliet, 
   who also begins to believe that Tim is back on the junk (he begins to 
   sweat profusely and pukes at the most inopportune times), but it 
   turns out someone is actually spiking Tim's milk. Tim is 
   strong-willed, nonetheless, and his investigation will lead him to a 
   retired probation officer named Mr. Copsey (Wilfred Hyde-White; <B><A HREF="chamber_of_horrors_1966.htm">CHAMBER
    OF HORRORS</A></B> - 1966) and a mysterious group known as the 
   &quot;Stepping Stones&quot;, which turn out to be the people Lucy 
   helped rehabilitate. Can Tim unravel this mystery before the police 
   arrest him or he is committed to a mental institution for seeing 
   things that aren't there (such as Sgt. Matthews, who the police never 
   heard of)? Or will he die before he discovers the truth?&nbsp; This 
   is an interesting murder mystery with a good performance by David 
   Hemmings as a man who is slowly being persecuted by forces unknown, 
   yet he remains unbowed in his determination to uncover the truth, 
   even if it means losing the trust or alienating those he loves. 
   Director Richard C. Sarafian (whose son, Deran Sarafian, would later 
   directs such genre films as <B><A HREF="alien_predators_1984.htm">ALIEN
    PREDATOR</A></B> [1984] and <B><A HREF="death_warrant_1990.htm">DEATH

   episodic American TV such as <B><A HREF="csi_tv.htm">CSI:</A></B><A HREF="csi_tv.htm"> 
   and its spin-offs</A>) and screenwriter Paul Dehn (<B><A HREF="goldfinger_1964.htm">GOLDFINGER</A></B> 
   - 1964) have created an excellent puzzle piece mystery that will not 
   easily be solved by the viewer. What I liked about <B><A HREF="fragment_of_fear_1970b.htm">FRAGMENT
    OF FEAR</A></B> is that it deals with several aspects of life (drug 
   addiction, love, conspiracies, secret societies, etc.) in a frank and 
   honest manner, without a hint of unwelcome humor, which belies its PG 
   (originally GP) rating. I won't give more away except to say that the 
   film manages to be thrilling and frightening without being 
   particularly violent or bloody. This film is character driven and 
   David Hemmings carries the film with his multi-layered performance. 
   The finale may be a little too ambiguous for some people's liking, 
   but it serves this film well. Richard Sarafian's last directorial 
   effort was the disappointing disaster flick <B><A HREF="solar_crisis_1990.htm">SOLAR
    CRISIS</A></B> (1990), which Sarafian decided to take an &quot;Alan

   rating (did the MPAA actually review this film?), making it a 
   thoroughly remarkable and funny tale of morals in this country. A

   become a major star is such films as <B><A HREF="legally_blonde_1&amp;2_2001-2003.htm">LEGALLY

   her prostitute mother and junkie stepfather are busted by the police. 
   Along the way, her car breaks down and she gets a ride from a child 
   psychiatrist (Kiefer Sutherland) who turns out to be a notorious 
   necropheliac serial killer. She manages to break free and shoots him 
   a half dozen times but he clings to life, his face horribly 
   disfigured. She is arrested for attempted murder. Due to her lengthly 
   juvenile record, the police do not believe her story and she is made 
   out to be the monster and he the innocent victim, due in a large part 
   by the efforts of his bitchy wife's (an excellent Brooke Shields) 
   media campaign of half-truths and misinformation. She is tried as an 
   adult and sentenced to life inprisonment. Forced to use violence as a 
   way to survive, she becomes a celebrity in prison and escapes with 
   the help of three female inmates. Meanwhile, the police are getting 
   closer to discovering the real truth. The finale takes place at 
   Grandma's house, where the disfigured serial killer subs for Grandma 
   and lies in waiting for his revenge. Writer/director Matthew Bright 
   offers a sassy script, surreal scenes and off-kilter violence and 
   blends it into a really satisfying brew. Oliver Stone was one of the

    Inspector Angelo De Pol (Jeff Blynn; the Stallone flick <B><A HREF="cliffhanger_1993.htm">CLIFFHANGER</A></B> 
   - 1993) standing over Fabio's body, on the shore near a Venice canal, 
   his pants open and blood everywhere. Near Fabio's body is his wife, 
   Flavia (Leonora Fani; <B><A HREF="dog_lay_afternoon_1976.htm">DOG LAY AFTERNOON</A></B> 
   - 1976), and she, too, is dead, dressed in a bright yellow sundress, 
   her body and clothes soaking wet. Alberto (Giancarlo Del Duca; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#CryOfAProstitute">CRY
    OF A PROSTITUTE</A></B> - 1974), the coroner, is at the crime scene 
   and he tells the Inspector that it looks like Flavia drowned, as 
   there are no traces of violence, only minor scratches on her body. 
   &quot;It's a mystery why the perpetrator pulled her out of the 
   water&quot; says Alberto. He also says that Fabio was stabbed in the 
   crotch with a sharp object, but it doesn't look like it was a knife. 
   He'll know more after he performs the autopsies. One of the 
   detectives finds pills on Fabio's body and Alberto says it looks like 
   LSD and the Inspector says, &quot;Yes, just what I wanted to 
   hear.&quot; Does he know something we don't? The Inspector's 
   assistant, Maestrin (Eolo Capritti; <B><A HREF="long_arm_of_the_godfather_1972.htm">THE
    LONG ARM OF THE GODFATHER</A></B> - 1972), thinks it's a drug deal 
   gone wrong, but that doesn't explain why Flavia is all wet. Hell, she 
   wasn't even wearing panties (or, as Alberto says, &quot;I guess she 
   wasn't worried about catching a cold!&quot;). The Inspector sees an 
   old man spying on them with binoculars from an apartment complex, so 
   he sends Maestrin to go question him, in case he saw the murders 
   happen. The old man, who has an elderly bedridden sister who can't 
   speak, tells Maestrin he didn't see anything, denies owning 
   binoculars and accuses him of police brutality! The Inspector, who 
   has the disgusting habit of eating hardboiled eggs at the most 
   inopportune times (leaving eggshells where he stands or sits), 
   chalks-up the murders to a bad drug deal, but I think we know by now 
   that it is never that easy.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    One of Venice's most powerful judges phones the Inspector, 
   complaining that the murders are on the front page of all the 
   newspapers. Since it is tourist season, he tells the Inspector to 
   find the killer and make it quick, because his job is on the line 
   (one of the most overused giallo clich&eacute;s). Alberto then phones 
   the Inspector, telling him that Flavia had sex shortly before she was 
   killed, but he cannot tell if it was consensual or if it was rape.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Inspector then questions Flavia's best friend, Marzia 
   (Mariangela Giordano, listed here as &quot;Maria Angela Giordan&quot;;
    <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BurialGround1980">BURIAL GROUND</A></B> 
   - 1980), who is getting phone calls from a man who calls her 
   &quot;slut&quot; and &quot;whore&quot; (She tells the Inspector that 
   the man is in love with her!). We discover Marzia and Flavia were 
   childhood friends, they even went to university together, but they 
   lost touch and just recently reconnected. Marzia didn't get along 
   with Fabio (who was an architect), but things improved as time moved 
   on. They all became friends and did everything together (I know what 
   you are thinking and you would be right!). She tells the Inspector 
   that Fabio didn't do drugs, but she looks guilty about something, 
   especially when the Inspector asks about Fabio and Flavia's sex life. 
   When he tells her that they found pornographic photos and equipment 
   to make porno films in Fabio &amp; Flavia's home, Marzia begins 
   telling the truth, where she says that Fabio had &quot;unusual 
   requests&quot; during sex. We are then taken back in time (an 
   elongated flashback), where we see who Fabio and Fabio really were, 
   at least according to Marzia.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We see Fabio and Flavia sitting in a ferry, as a handsome young man 
   watches them kissing and making out. They put on a show for him 
   (Flavia looks unwilling, but Fabio talks her into it) and when the 
   ferry docks, he follows them home. Before they get home, Fabio &amp; 
   Flavia put a pornographic show for him, Fabio pulling down Flavia's 
   panties and fucking her (standing up!) in a boatyard. The man looks 
   on intently, Fabio making eye contact with him, but the man, who then 
   looks disgusted, walks away. Once home, Fabio begins playing with a 
   piece of fruit as if it is a vagina (you have to see it to believe 
   it!), while Flavia complains that she doesn't want to play sex games 
   anymore, as it made her feel &quot;shabby&quot;. She runs into the 
   bedroom, strips naked and she and Fabio make love. Like most men, 
   Fabio finishes before Flavia does, gets up and walks out of the 
   bedroom (completely naked), and then begins to read an S&amp;M 
   pornographic comic strip, leaving Flavia to finish the job manually 
   (If you know what I mean. Even if you don't, no need to worry, as the 
   camera shows you in extreme close-up!). Fabio gets so turned-on by 
   the comic strip, he does the same thing (thankfully, not in extreme 
   close-up!). Fabio then walks into the bedroom, sees his wife naked 
   and begins whipping her with a cat o' nine tails! (I can't stop using 
   exclamation points!!!). She begs Fabio to stop, but he just whips her 
   harder, finishing the job by making love to her (and she loves it!). 
   Once again, he finishes before his wife does, only this time he falls 
   asleep in bed&nbsp; (and all this happens in the first 30 minutes!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Back in the present, the Inspector has tapped Marzia's phone, as he 
   doesn't believe her explanation about the man who is calling her. 
   While Marzia is away, Maestrin searches her home, finding, hidden in 
   one of her dresser drawers, a box of 35mm pornographic slides and a 
   note that reads &quot;I won't let you stay with that bunch of 
   perverts. I'd rather kill you!&quot; Of course, the note is unsigned. 
   We then see Marzia meeting a man at an outdoor bistro and he wants to 
   know if she destroyed the slides. She tells him no and he demands 
   that she give them to him. She calls him crazy, not noticing that 
   there is a man wearing mirrored sunglasses watching them (another

   Marzia says, &quot;He's a fanatic. He's capable of anything.&quot;, 
   so Marco tells her to get out of Venice and go on a vacation if she 
   is so scared. Is it possible that the man in the mirrored sunglasses

    The Inspector and Maestrin look at the slides from Marzia's house 
   and they show Fabio, Flavia and Marzia having a m&eacute;nage a 
   trois. They also show Marzia &amp; Flavia having lesbian sex, as well 
   as Marzia &amp; Marco enjoying intercourse. The Inspector knows Marco 
   Dezan as a criminal and says, &quot;Sex is always the key!&quot; 
   There is also an unknown woman in the slides, which no one can 
   identify. The Inspector says something smells funny (it could be his 
   hardboiled eggs, which he never stops eating!), as this crime doesn't 
   make sense. Who would want to kill Fabio and Flavia and what possibly 
   could be their motive? If you have paid close attention to this 
   review, you have enough clues to figure it out on your own. Just 
   remember this: The first scene in most giallo films is the most 
   important and it's no different here. Need more info? OK...</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Alberto tells the Inspector that Fabio was stabbed in the crotch 
   with scissors, the kind that tailors use. He jokingly tells the 
   Inspector to arrest all the tailors in town and then he will have the 
   killer. The man in the mirrored sunglasses then pays a prostitute for 
   sex, demanding that they do it outside and standing up (Now where did 
   I hear that before?). As they are doing it, the man pulls out some 
   scissors and stabs her repeatedly in the vagina (nothing is left to 
   the imagination). The Inspector pulls in Marzia and Marco for 
   questioning and they both have alibis on where they were when Fabio, 
   Flavia and the prostitute were killed, as they were with each other, 
   but are they lying? That's all you are going to get from me without 
   giving away the ending. But what do Marco, who is set on fire after 
   being doused with gasoline and Marzia having her right leg cut off 
   with a hacksaw (while she's alive!) have to do with all this? Yes, 
   these are only but two scenes (no details are left out) where the 
   camera lingers on the carnage, where we see Marco's body after he is 
   burned alive (It is pretty disgusting) and a cleaning lady discovers 
   Marzia's corpse in her refrigerator, her severed right leg posed next 
   to her! What does it all mean?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This film wallows in voyeuristic near-pornographic sex, as well as 
   gratuitous violence (You have to see Marzia getting her leg cut 
   off!), so much so, I felt like taking a cold shower after watching 
   it. While this film has no redeeming social value, it does have a 
   certain something that will not allow you to take your eyes off the 
   screen. I think it's the filmic filth that this film seems just a 
   little too accommodating to show, as in flashback, we see Fabio and 
   Flavia in all sorts of pornographic poses, being it Fabio raping 
   Flavia outside a store teeming with customers or Fabio letting a 
   total stranger feel Flavia up in a dark movie theater. There's 
   nothing Fabio won't do for a sexual thrill (most of it at Flavia's 
   expense) and this film is more than happy to show them to you, some 
   linger longer than you will feel comfortable with, especially in the 
   sad, nihilistic, yet fitting finale, where we discover the real 
   reason Fabio and Flavia were killed. Which is surprising, since

   The screenplay, by Aldo Serio (<B><A HREF="watch_me_when_i_kill_1977.htm">WATCH
    ME WHEN I KILL</A></B> - 1977), is basically nothing but a bunch of 
   giallo film clich&eacute;s, spiced-up with plentiful male and female 
   full-frontal nudity, sex that cross the porn level not so gently and 
   bloody gore. Sometimes that is all I need from a film, but very 
   rarely, which makes this film seem worthwhile to me for reasons I 
   can't put my finger on. Maybe it's because I'm a dirty old bastard, 
   but for whatever reason, I liked this film. I also doubt that it is a 
   coincidence that Maestrin looks and dresses like <B><A HREF="kojak_70s_tv_series.htm">KOJAK</A></B> 
   and that many American TV detective clich&eacute;s are used here, 
   especially Inspector De Pol's fondness for hardboiled eggs, which is 
   probably similar to Kojak's fondness for lollipops (but without the 
   stench or mess). When we discover how Fabio and Flavia ended up dead 
   near the canal, thanks to the old man with the binoculars, who saw 
   everything, it is quite shocking and unexpected, taking the meaning 
   of &quot;voyeurism&quot; to a whole new level, so just go with it, 
   you will probably like this film, even if it is for all the wrong 
   reasons. I won't judge you because I am just as guilty.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   violent brothers go to the &quot;Casino Lisboa&quot; and interrupt 
   the stage show (a French can-can review) by acting rowdy and 
   beligerent. When the manager of the club, Chieh Ying (Pauline Wong), 
   asks them to calm down, they grope her, forcing Cheih to slap one of 
   the brothers and call Security, who throw them out. The brothers wait 
   for Chieh to get off work, where they grab her, bring her to a 
   cemetery and gang-rape her (one of the brothers burns her with a 
   disposable lighter when she refuses to move while he screws her!). In 
   her shame, Chieh never reports the rape and returns to her regular 
   routine. One day, she has a burning sensation between her legs, so 
   she goes to a doctor, who tells her that she has a serious case of VD 
   (His exact words are: &quot;You must have had filthy sex partners. 
   Your uterus will soon rot, leading to cancer of the uterus!&quot;) 
   and she will soon die. What is a poor girl to do? Well, since this is 
   a crazy, out-of-control Hong Kong thriller, she decides to get even 
   with her five rapists before she kicks-off. After telling her blind 
   sister her whole sordid story, Chieh leaves mainland China and heads 
   to Hong Kong in search of Hsiung (Lam Ching-Ying), her 
   wheelchair-bound Uncle, who was also her blind sister's lover (!). 
   Hsiung, who runs a nightclub/whorehouse called the San Francisco Bar, 
   knows a thing or two about vengeance, but he initially refuses to 
   help Chieh in her plot for revenge since he knows the high price that 
   usually has to be paid (for him it was the loss of his legs). He does 
   give her a job as a waitress at his bar, where we watch how Hsiung 
   deals with unruly customers (he uses his wheelchair as a weapon and 
   is quite handy with it!). As luck would have it, the five rapist

   bar, she tricks him into driving out to the middle of nowhere for a 
   &quot;snack&quot; (i.e. a blowjob). She manages to tie the guy's 
   hands behind his back and then cuts his ear off with a pair of 
   scissors and finishes him offf by strangling him from behind as he 
   kicks-out the car windshield. One down, four to go. Chieh tricks 
   another brother into thinking he's inheriting some insurance money 
   from his dead brother, but she fails to kill him, even after throwing 
   acid in his face and stabbing him in the back. She is successful in 
   her next attempt, impaling another brother in the stomach with a 
   sharpened pipe while he is filming a porno flick. When the remaining 
   three brothers find out Chieh's identity and kill her blind sister, 
   Hsiung has no choice but to join Chieh in her quest for bloody 
   revenge. The finale is a non-stop barrage of death in depravity that 
   will make the most jaded gorehound sit up and take notice.&nbsp; This 
   sleazy, nasty rape/revenge thriller leaves very little to the 
   imagination, as it is full of nudity, blood and scenes of brutal 
   violence. As directed by Nam Nai Choi (a.k.a. &quot;Simon Nam&quot;),

   is your basic &quot;rapist out for revenge&quot; scenario, but the 
   execution is anything but basic. It's absolutely delirious. Not only 
   do we get to see various impalements, stabbings, dismemberments, 
   slashings and head bashings (with exotic pointy fruit!), we are also 
   privvy to the unusual sights of Hsiung bathing his two leg stumps 
   (both legs are cut-off above the knees) and a finale that is one of 
   the most amazing and demented white-knuckle sequences in recent 
   memory. Without giving too much away, it contains wheelchair-fu, a 
   homemade crossbow and a never-say-die attitude displayed by one of 
   the characters that's remarkable in it's savagery and grace. You'll 
   know what I mean when you see it. If this film does have a fault, 
   it's the subplot about Chieh Ying's friendship and possible romance 
   with young man Hsiao Hao (Kelvin Wong). It's a rather pointless 
   affair, since they will never be able to consummate their 
   relationship (She's riddled with an STD after all!), but he 
   eventually becomes a victim of his desires. While trying to stop 
   Chieh from killing one of her rapists, he pays for it with his life.

   lets her anger and jealousy get the better of her and decides to stay

   help. Her sister calls Kevin when the police refuse to help and Kevin 
   begins his search to Daniela, picking up a clue from a pothead biker 
   who said he saw Daniela get picked-up by a guy driving a motor home. 
   Kevin begins following every motor home he spots (too bad the pothead 
   wasn't more specific and told him it was a Winnebago), even breaking 
   into one and getting the shit kicked out of him by it's angry black 
   owner. Mark drugs Daniela, cuts and dyes her blonde hair brown to 
   make her look like the photo of a 39 year-old Russian woman called 
   Danyetska that he keeps in his RV, which turns out to be his whore 
   mother. Daniela lets Mark make love to her, but Mark ejaculates

   (who carves the word &quot;PIG&quot; on Kevin's chest with a 
   switchblade) and must watch as Mark threatens to shove a knife up 
   Daniela's vagina (he doesn't though). It all ends rather badly as 
   Kevin is stabbed to death, Daniela is left for dead (of a drug 
   overdose) in the trunk of a car in an auto junkyard and Mark 
   continues picking-up female hitchhikers, only his latest pick-up is 
   none other than Daniela, who shoots Mark several times as a final

    While they are driving home to Los Angeles (towing their camper

   three deadly bank robbers who stole $2 million in cash, leaving a 
   wake of death in their path. Just as soon as they hear the radio 
   broadcast, Eve almost hits a bunch of boulders in the middle of the 
   road (Walter is too drunk to drive), forcing her to pull over to the 
   side of the road. They spot a man getting out of a disabled car and 
   it is Adam Konitz (David Hess). He asks the couple for a ride, but 
   Walter doesn't want to give him one. Eve, on the other hand, welcomes 
   another person in the car, if only not to hear her husband's 
   incessant drunken ramblings. We all know that Adam is one of the bank 
   robbers (we see a dead man inside the disabled car, a bullet wound in 
   his head) and, very soon, Walter and Eve will know it, too. They 
   introduce themselves to each other (Adam makes an &quot;Adam &amp; 
   Eve&quot; remark as a sexual overture) and Adam proceeds to play head 
   games with the couple, much of it sexual, as he begins to touch Eve 
   in ways that Walter never dreamed of. The problem is, this couple 
   have already been playing head games with each other, so Adam will 
   have to work very hard to get the couple to fear for their lives, 
   especially when he shows them a suitcase containing the $2 million in 
   cash. We must figure out: Who is playing who?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   one of the policemen, flashing the inside of a matchbook where he has 
   written &quot;SOS&quot;. Adam knows something is wrong by the looks 
   on the officer's face, so he shoots the two officers dead (The second 
   officer is shot through his motorcycle helmet, as we watch his brains 
   explode out of the back of his helmet). Instead of Adam being mad, he 
   admires Walter's moxey. Their next stop is a gas station, where Adam 
   stuffs a fifty dollar bill into Eve's cleavage (&quot;I wish I was 
   that fifty!&quot; says Adam) and tells her to buy two cartons of 
   Camel cigarettes (everyone here smokes like a chimney) and two 
   bottles of scotch. While Eve is trying to tell the Mexican clerk 
   (Ignazio Spalla; <B><A HREF="adios_sabata_1970.htm">ADIOS SABATA</A></B> 
   - 1970; billed here as &quot;Pedro Sanchez&quot;) that she and her 
   husband are being held prisoner, Adam makes a deal with Walter to 
   write a book about his life (Walter has a reel-to-reel tape recorder 
   in the car, which Adam talks into.). Eve can't get the clerk to 
   understand her (He doesn't understand or speak English!) and Adam 
   knew that because he has been to this gas station many time before. 
   That night, while pulled over to someplace secluded, Adam ties-up 
   Walter and makes him watch Eve being sexually assaulted (and she 
   likes it). Then two shots ring out and Adam falls into a lake. He was 
   shot by his two partners-in-crime, Hawk (Carlo Puri) and Oaks 
   (&quot;John Loffredo&quot;; real name: Joshua Sinclair; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Last Shark">THE
    LAST SHARK</A></B> - 1981), who take Walter and Eve hostage and make 
   them drive to Mexico while they hide out in the trailer with the money.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    They are then run off the road by a red tow truck, which then blocks 
   the road. It's no surprise that Adam is behind the wheel, as he 
   shoots Hawk in the chest and wings Oaks in the arm. Adam deceives his 
   two partners and Walter by saying that he is driving his two friends 
   to a doctor and letting Walter and Eve go free, but when he gets Hawk 
   and Oaks in the tow truck, he drives the truck over an embankment, 
   jumping out just before the truck bursts into flames and explodes as 
   it barrels down a mountainside (It's quite a sight and Adam says to 
   his partners, &quot;Bye, faggots!&quot;). Adam continues on his trip 
   with the captive couple, but just who is playing who?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Filled with eye-opening full-frontal nudity by Corrine Clery (who 
   says in an extra on the disc that it was her favorite role of her 
   career), such as the scene of Adam running his hands up and down 
   Eve's naked body as she lies next to a campfire, while a tied-up 
   Walter is forced to watch her reach a climax, something Walter was 
   never able to let her achieve. As I said in the beginning of this 
   review, David Hess basically reprises his Krug role in LHOTL, 
   demeaning Eve sexually (but the more he does, the more she likes it!) 
   and laughing maniacally like some out-of-control mental patient, 
   which we then discover (with a conversation with Walter as he tells 
   his life story) that is really what he is. When he was younger, he 
   escaped from a mental institution. But the biggest surprise this film 
   offers is the unexpected finale, where a totally naked Eve kills Adam 
   with the same hunting rifle Walter pointed at her on the hunting 
   trip. She ends up saving Walter's life because Adam was about to kill 
   him. Walter begins to look at Eve differently, the way she always 
   hoped he would, but the temptation of $2 million in cash just becomes 
   too tempting, bringing this film to a totally unexpected, nihilistic 
   ending (which I won't spoil for you here).</FONT></FONT><BR>

   shocking. While it does have plenty of nudity, the violence (which is 
   sparse) comes quickly, without warning and is bloody. Screenwriters 
   Campanile, Aldo Crudo (<B><A HREF="super_stooges_vs_the_wonder_women_1975.htm">SUPER

   and put-downs, as Adam demeans the couple, just as much verbally as 
   he does physically. Franco Nero is very good in his role (he said he 
   had a &quot;blast&quot; making this film); his icy blue eyes do just 
   as much talking as his voice and, for once, he is not dubbed by 
   someone else (his voice is just as distinctive as his eyes). Also 
   above average is Ennio Morricone's effective score, which consists of 
   a plucking banjo, acoustic guitar and other spare instruments, 
   evocative of the beautiful Mexican scenery. But oh!, that ending. It 
   must have had the same visceral gut-punch as <B><A HREF="dirty_mary_crazy_larry_1974.htm">DIRTY

   - 1982), wife of rich Emmett Kramer (Mitchell Gregg), in the very 
   same house. Emmett is the son of the elderly couple that was murdered 
   years earlier and ever since that fateful day, Marsha has gone off 
   the deep end, trying to kill herself several times and the creepy 
   housekeeper, Norma (Irenee Byatt), was struck dumb by the sight of 
   the carnage and hasn't spoken a word ever since. Jennifer has some 
   problems of her own, as her ex-con boyfriend, Mark (Arell Blanton), 
   who was just released from prison after serving a three-year stretch 
   for armed robbery and is the father of Jennifer's young son (who is 
   staying with her mother while Jennifer does her nursing gig), follows 
   her from San Francisco in hopes of rekindling their relationship. 
   When Mark discovers that Jennifer is working for Emmett, one of the 
   richest people in town, you can practically see dollar signs floating 
   above his head in a circle.<A HREF="house_of_terror_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/house of terror vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="155" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   Jennifer is not treated very nicely in the Kramer household, as 
   Marsha calls her a tramp and accuses her of having an affair with her 
   husband; Norma gives her the cold shoulder; someone leaves a teddy 
   bear with a knife in it's stomach on her bed; someone is spying on 
   her in her bedroom through a peephole behind a painting; and Emmett 
   slowly begins putting the moves on her. One stormy night, while Norma 
   is masturbating in bed while holding a photo of Emmett, Jennifer 
   wakes up when bloody water seeps from her bedroom ceiling and she 
   discovers that Marsha has committed suicide by slitting her wrists in 
   the bathtub. Mark comes up with a plan to make a lot of money off the 
   suicide by proposing marriage to Jennifer, but first he must talk her 
   into seducing and marrying Emmett (not a hard to do since Emmett has 
   been madly in love with her since the fist day they met). Mark moves 
   into the house and pretends to be Jennifer's brother and he now wants 
   Jennifer to kill Emmett instead of divorcing him (He says, &quot;Why 
   have half when you can have it all!&quot;). Mark also picks this time 
   to tell Jennifer that he killed Marsha and made it look like a 
   suicide, so in for a penny, in for a pound. Jennifer and Mark wait 
   two years before the time is right to kill Emmett, but a monkey 
   wrench gets thrown into their plan by the sudden appearance of 
   Marsha's twin sister Dolores (Hyde again), a snarky actress who knows 
   that Mark and Jennifer are up to no good (and has her own romantic 
   eye on Emmett). Dolores tries to drive Jennifer crazy by restaging 
   Marsha's &quot;suicide&quot;, while Mark cuts the brake line on 
   Emmett's car, hoping he'll die in a car accident (he doesn't, but he 
   comes close). Mark then joins forces with Dolores and they throw both 
   Emmett and Jennifer overboard in the middle of the ocean. Dolores 
   inherits all of Emmett's money, but the finale finds Dolores trapped 
   in a hot (and getting hotter) sauna with the corpse of Mark (who was 
   stabbed in the neck with a steak knife), compliments of housekeeper 
   Norma, who has regained her power of speech and is now laughing like 
   an insane loon. Don't you just love happy endings?&nbsp; This murder 
   mystery/crime thriller, directed/produced by Sergei Goncharoff (his 
   only directorial effort, although he has produced other films, such 
   as the Robert Forster-starrer <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#WalkingTheEdge">WALKING
    THE EDGE</A></B> [1983]) and written by Tony Crechales (<B><A HREF="impulse_1974.htm">IMPULSE</A></B>

   SKYCOPTER RESCUE</A></B> - 1980) and E.A. Charles, has a few 
   effective scenes, but is mostly a boring talkfest. The acting is 
   second-rate and stagey and the violence is limited to a couple of 
   bloody stabbings and Emmett's wild ride in his brakeless car (this 
   was rated PG when released to theaters, although the violence looks 
   to be trimmed slightly in the stabbing scenes). There's plenty of 
   colorful 70's fashions, hairstyles and music to keep your eyes and 
   ears occupied (not to mention the ridiculous makeup applied to both 
   Marsha and Norma, which makes them look more like zombies than human 
   beings), but the story is an all-too-common tale of double and triple 
   crosses, where no one is whom they seem to be, with a creepy (though 
   not unexpected) final denouement. This is nothing but a typical 70's 
   MFTV crime thriller with a little extra blood, some mild cursing and 
   a brief bit of nudity thrown in for good measure. <B><A HREF="house_of_terror_1972c.htm">HOUSE

   So begins this film, a stark black and white Gothic mystery based on 
   the crimes of London serial killer Martin Bauer, but not true in the 
   least. The truth of the matter is Martin Bauer never existed, as 
   didn't The Hyena of London. Even if he did exist, he is only a side 
   note here, used in the beginning and finale of this film simply as a 
   plot device. But let's get back to the film. We then see Big Ben 
   chime twelve, as Martin Bauer (actor unknown) is being escorted from 
   his cell to make the long walk down a dark, stark tunnel to the 
   gallows, where he is hung by the neck (offscreen) and then buried in 
   a pauper's grave. We then see an intoxicated cemetery night watchman 
   stumbling over Martin Bauer's grave, finding his gravesite ransacked 
   and his body missing from his wooden crate coffin. Is it possible he 
   has returned from the dead to claim more victims?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A short time later, we are at the town of Bradford, a small village 
   near London, where John Reed (Mario Militia, using the name 
   &quot;Robert Burton&quot;) is kicked out of a pub because it is 
   midnight, closing time. John's wife, Margaret (Anita Tedesco; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Embalmer1965">THE
    EMBALMER</A></B> - 1965; using the name &quot;Annie Benson&quot;), 
   meets him in front of the pub and tries to drag him back home, 
   telling him she has done this one too many times and it has to stop. 
   John falls down drunk and passes out on a doorstep while Margaret 
   tries to wake him up. A stranger approaches Margaret and by the look 
   on her face, it tells us she is no longer for this world. We hear her 
   muffled screams and then we are at the Bedford Police Department, 
   where John has been arrested and charged for the murder of his wife, 
   but he pleads to Inspector Brett O'Connor (Thomas Walton) that he his 
   innocent, he loved his wife and he is then dragged away to his jail 
   cell. Dr. Edward Dalton (Bernard Price) then enters the Inspector's 
   office, where he tells the Inspector and Scotland Yard attach&eacute; 
   Quayle (Gino Rumor) that Margaret was strangled by someone with quite 
   ferocious might. Quayle says it is obviously John because drunks are 
   known to be stronger than they have any right to be. The Inspector 
   ask Dr. Dalton if it is possible that John is the killer, but before 
   he can answer, Quayle interjects and says Margaret may have scolded 
   John bitterly and he snapped, killing her in the process. Dr. Dalton 
   looks at him and says if a man's life is at stake, you must be very 
   sure of his guilt. Quayle says he is positively sure that John is the 
   killer, so Dr. Dalton gives him a dirty look, excuses himself and 
   walks out of the room. When Dr. Dalton leaves the room, Quayle says, 
   &quot;He evidently doesn't like me.&quot; The Inspector looks him 
   straight in the eyes and replies, &quot;Evidently.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see three women doing their laundry in the Bradford public 
   fountain. One woman says John is not guilty, but another woman 
   believes he is innocent. The third woman, Mary (actress unknown), 
   tells the both of them that she was close friends with Margaret and 
   they talked often. She tells them Margaret never cheated on John, but 
   she believes John may have abused Margaret, even though she never 
   told her that. Enter Henry Dwyn (Tony Kendall; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LoreleysGrasp1973">THE
    LORELEY'S GRASP</A></B> - 1973), an old flame of Mary's that she 
   hasn't seen in over two years. Mary begins to get chummy with Henry, 
   but he tells her to forget about him and walks away. It is obvious 
   something is troubling him, as we previously saw him standing on the 
   street next to the police station, with a look on his face that would 
   make anyone worried. Could he be the murderer or does he who know is?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Henry then meets his true love, Muriel (Diana Martin; <B><A HREF="taste_for_killing_1966.htm">A
    TASTE OF KILLING</A></B> - 1966), who is Dr. Dalton's daughter. 
   Muriel knows her father would never approve of Henry because he is 
   broke and comes from a lower-class family, something that is 
   &quot;beneath&quot; his standards. They have to sneak behind Dr. 
   Dalton's back to see each other, so they agree to meet in two days 
   next to their favorite oak tree. When Muriel is riding her horse 
   home, something in the woods gets her attention. Dr. Dalton hears his 
   daughter's screams and goes running to Muriel, who has found a body 
   of a man buried in a shallow grave, his hand jutting out of the dirt. 
   Back at the house, Dr. Dalton tells servant Peter (our old friend 
   Luciano Pigozzi; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#EvilEye1975">EVIL EYE</A></B> 
   - 1975; once again using his frequent &quot;Alan Collins&quot; 
   pseudonym) to get his horse ready, he has to go to the Inspector's 
   office to talk about the dead body they found (In case you haven't 
   guessed, Dr. Dalton is also the official coroner of Bradford). While 
   Peter is getting the horse and carriage ready (and trying to avoid 
   Dr. Dalton's pet dog, who is chained to a post and barking at him 
   viciously), Dr. Dalton pays his daughter a visit in her bedroom. 
   Muriel hasn't been able to sleep since discovering the dead body, but 
   her father tells her to put it out of her mind. Dr. Dalton also finds 
   his assistant, Dr. Anthony Finney (Angelo Dessy; <B><A HREF="shango_1970.htm">SHANGO</A></B> 
   - 1970; who uses the Anglicized name &quot;James Harrison&quot;), 
   taking a swig of booze from a bottle. Anthony is an alcoholic who 
   lost a prestigious job in London because of his alcoholism, but Dr. 
   Dalton took pity on him and hired him as his assistant, but under one 
   condition, that he never touch a single drop of alcohol again. After 
   finding Anthony drinking again, Dr. Dalton tells him that if he ever 
   catches him consuming alcohol or smells it on his breath ever again, 
   his ass will be out the door and he will make sure no one hires him 
   as a doctor ever again. (Back then alcoholism wasn't considered an 
   addiction, but a personal choice. Ah, London in the late-1800s, a 
   simpler time!). Dr. Dalton tells Anthony that if he leaves the house, 
   he should tell him where he is going, because he needed him earlier 
   in the morning and could not find him. Anthony tells him he took an 
   hour off and went for a walk in the park. Is Anthony lying?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    That night, Anthony tries to sneak into Muriel's bedroom, but 
   housekeeper Margie (Denise Clar) catches him before he is able to 
   open the door. Before she can ask him what she is doing, Peter 
   (Margie's husband) calls for her to come downstairs and Anthony walks 
   away. She tells Peter that Anthony tried to enter Muriel's bedroom 
   again and Peter says that the must tell Dr. Dalton, but Margie says, 
   &quot;Why? This doesn't concern us.&quot; Peter begrudgingly agrees.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Inspector O'Connor asks Dr. Dalton if he can determine how long the 
   body Muriel discovered was dead and he says no more than two weeks, 
   The Inspector also asks if anyone but him and Muriel know about the 
   dead body and Dr. Dalton says no, so the Inspector tells him it must 
   remain a secret and that goes for Muriel as well. Dr. Dalton says 
   don't worry, he will make sure no one else knows about it. The 
   Inspector wants to do an investigation without worrying the villagers 
   and to determine if it is related to Margaret's murder, but Quayle 
   appears and once again states that John Reed killed Margaret and he 
   could also be responsible for this dead body. Why does Quayle have 
   such a hard-on for John?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see that Anthony is married to Elizabeth (Claude Dantes; <B><A HREF="blood_and_black_lace_1964.htm">BLOOD
    AND BLACK LACE</A></B> - 1964). She demands to know why he suddenly 
   left London and came to Bradford (she has no idea he's an alcoholic, 
   something I find hard to believe). She tells Anthony that he makes 
   her feel like an outsider and that she spent the best years of her 
   life to be by his side, has he forgotten that? Anthony refuses to 
   tell her that he's an alcoholic, so Elizabeth calls him a &quot;vile 
   being&quot; and that she gave up everything to be with him. Anthony 
   tells her to stop playing the victim, it doesn't suit her. Elizabeth 
   says she wishes she never met him and then they passionately kiss and 
   make love in the woods (Reminding me of why I was married two times!).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Dr. Dalton leaves for a conference in London, telling Muriel he will 
   be back tomorrow night and she should stay home and get some rest 
   because she is looking pale, but who is the man secretly unlocking 
   the door to Dr. Dalton's study and entering it? It's another servant, 
   Chris (John Mathews), and when he walks out of the study carrying a 
   small black velvet pouch containing Muriel's expensive jewelry, 
   Margie catches him, but he gives her half of the jewelry and she is

    Elizabeth tells Anthony she will spend the night with him tomorrow, 
   all this sneaking around is turning her on. When Anthony sees Muriel 
   riding away on her horse, Elizabeth asks him if he knows her and he 
   says no, but the look on his face tells her another story (leading to 
   another quarrel). Anthony then tells Elizabeth that they shouldn't 
   see each other for a while, saying she should go back to London and 
   await his return, so Elizabeth hops on her horse and follows Muriel, 
   seeing her meet Henry by the old oak tree (no yellow ribbons, though! 
   [bad joke]). While the Inspector and Quayle are arguing over the 
   merits of Scotland Yard, Officer Brown (Attilio Dottesio; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#DeathSmilesMurder73">DEATH
    SMILES ON A MURDERER</A></B> - 1973) enters the Inspector's office 
   to tell him that John Reed committed suicide in his jail cell buy 
   cutting his wrists with a broken dinner plate. Henry tells Muriel 
   that she has to tell her father about their relationship, he is tired 
   of sneaking around and wants it out in the open. Muriel tells him 
   it's best if they wait, but Henry tells her he will never be rich no 
   matter how long they wait. He also knows that Anthony is lusting 
   after her and is an alcoholic and it bothers him that he lives under 
   the same roof as her. Muriel calls Anthony a &quot;good man&quot; and 
   her father did well to give him a hand. Henry then tells Muriel, 
   &quot;Your dear father will end up making you a fine old 
   spinster&quot; and Muriel slaps him in the face. Henry leaves in a 
   huff, not even saying goodbye to Muriel.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    So when is all this interpersonal drama going to end before we get 
   to the meat of the story? Apparently, not for a while, as more 
   relationships and lusting are revealed. Chris is sleeping with Margie 
   and Peter is getting suspicious. Peter catches Henry skulking on the 
   property (He came there to apologize to Muriel) and tells Chris to 
   take him to the Inspector. Henry refuses to talk to the Inspector, so 
   he throws him in jail, telling Chris to have Peter write up a 
   detailed report of what Henry was doing on the property. Quayle then 
   gets the idea that Henry is the killer, telling the Inspector that 
   Henry is a stranger in Bradford, but the Inspector orders Quayle to 
   go to London and not come back until he has the identity of the dead 
   body (The Inspector is not going to have Henry end up like John 
   Reed). Anthony continues lusting after Muriel, finally making her 
   uncomfortable. When Dr. Dalton returns home and discovers that his 
   daughters valuable jewelry has been stolen, the most likely suspect 
   is Henry, but the Inspector is not so sure, telling Peter to have 
   Chris come to his office tomorrow morning. Quayle comes back from 
   London with the identity of the dead body. It's serial killer Martin 
   Bauer (no surprise there), but who dug up his body in London and 
   reburied it in Bradford? I guess the better question is why did they 
   do it? Another young woman is then murdered in Bradford and it 
   couldn't be Henry because he's still in jail. Henry breaks out of his 
   cell and runs to Muriel, but the killer has<A HREF="hyena_of_london_1964.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hyena of london italy poster6 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="209" HEIGHT="303" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   her and is walking through the woods carrying her unconscious 
   body.&nbsp; We find out in the last five minutes of the film who the 
   killer actually is, in a rushed finale that tries to tie-up all the 
   loose ends. It is also confusing as hell, especially the killer's 
   motivation, which comes out of left field when Officer Brown 
   discovers the killer's diary (Hint: It is the last person you would

    This black &amp; white period piece, directed and written by 
   &quot;Henry Wilson&quot; (actually Gino Mangini, director of the 
   obscure <B><A HREF="no_diamonds_for_ursula_1967.htm">NO DIAMONDS FOR URSULA</A></B> 
   [1967] and the Spaghetti Western <B><A HREF="bastard_go_and_kill_1971.htm">BASTARD,
    GO AND KILL</A></B> [1971]), contains too much soap opera and 
   precious little mystery, but when the killer is revealed and his 
   motives are made known, it was surprising, at least to me, because it 
   just comes out of the Twilight Zone (It has a look an feel of one of 
   those German Edgar Wallace &quot;Krimis&quot; of the early-'60s, such 
   as <B><A HREF="inn_on_the_river_1962.htm">INN ON THE RIVER</A></B> 
   [1962])). The motive is really &quot;out there&quot;, as the killer 
   invented a serum to transfer the thoughts of a dead person into the 
   mind of a living one, digging up the corpse of Martin Bauer and using 
   the serum on himself to see what makes a killer kill, but once 
   Bauer's thoughts were entered into his brain, he became a serial 
   killer with no memory of doing the killings! Far out, right? So why 
   did he do it? For the recognition and appreciation of his peers, of 
   course! This bit of important information comes out of nowhere and 
   ends the film. It's like Mangini lost control of his script and 
   painted himself into a corner, so he added some science fiction to 
   the plot to wrap things up. This way, audiences could get the 
   surprise reveal they want and Mangini would get a releasable film. 
   What this film has in its favor is a thick Gothic atmosphere that 
   doesn't quit and a larger role than normal for one of my favorite 
   Italian genre actors, Luciano Pigozzi, Italy's answer to Peter Lorre 
   (Thanks, Steve!). If you like Italian Gothic films of the early-'60s 
   (and you should), then this little-seen gem should be part of your 
   must-see list.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    THE CO-ED KILLER</A><A NAME="KemperCoedKiller"></A> (2008) -</B> 
   Totally fictitious account of serial killer Edmund Kemper who, in the 
   early 70's, killed a series of female student hitchhikers, then had 
   sex with their bodies before dissecting them. (First the true part: 
   When he was a teenager in 1964, Kemper shot and killed his 
   grandmother because he &quot;just wanted to see what it felt like to 
   kill Grandma&quot; and then killed his grandfather because he knew 
   Grandpa would be angry with him for what he had done. He spent the 
   rest of the 60's in a psychiatric hospital, where it was discovered 
   he had an IQ of 136. He was paroled in 1971 into his mother's care, 
   against the wishes of many doctors at the hospital. Now for the false 
   portion: This film picks-up after these events. W-a-a-a-a-y after 
   these events. Somehow, Kemper has miraculously transported himself to 
   2008 and is beginning his female student killing spree...) The film 
   begins with Detective Tom Harris (Christopher Stapleton) checking out 
   Kemper's latest murder scene: The home of a young co-ed Kemper has 
   killed at the kitchen table, cut off her head and placed it in the 
   oven. <A HREF="kemper_the_coed_killer_2008.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/kemper custom dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Detective
    Harris then receives a call on his cell phone and heads to another 
   crime scene, where someone has chopped-up a young soccer mom with an 
   axe and left her dead body on the side of a road. Detective Harris 
   believes there are two killers on the loose, so he shows the crime 
   scene photos to good friend Ed Kemper (Robert Sisko), not aware that 
   Ed is one of the killers (Ed previously helped Harris on another case 
   that proved beneficial). Ed has a sickly, domineering mother who 
   verbally abuses him nightly, so while he helps Harris with the soccer 
   mom case, he makes Harris' life difficult by picking up female 
   hitchhikers and dumping their raped, slaughtered bodies for Harris to 
   find. When Ed finally bashes his mother's head in with a hammer and 
   kills her, Ed finally fesses-up to Harris (by cell phone, of course) 
   that he is a serial killer and from then on, the cat-and-mouse game 
   is on (Harris finds Ed's mother's decapitated head in the Kemper 
   kitchen, hanging with the pots and pans). Ed constantly taunts Harris 
   over the phone, eventually shooting Harris' partner, Detective Ross 
   (Sean Thomas), in the arm and getting Harris pulled from the case. Ed 
   does something drastic to get Harris put back on the case, which 
   leads to a final showdown between Ed and Harris in an abandoned 
   hospital; the hospital Ed was born in. The same hospital he may die 
   in. You know, the circle of life and all that shit.&nbsp; I could 
   almost forgive that the story was moved nearly forty years into the 
   future, but it becomes too easy to see why director Rick Bitzelberger 
   and screenwriter Jack Perez (writer and director of <B><A HREF="monster_island_2004.htm">MONSTER
    ISLAND</A></B> - 2004) did so: It not only saves on the expense of 
   outfitting the actors in 70's period fashions, automobiles and set 
   direction, it also affords that most of the screen time is spent with 
   the actors talking on cell phones. If I had to hazard a guess, I 
   would estimate that 70% of screen time revolves around Ed and Harris 
   talking to each other on their cell phones. The other 30% is either 
   Harris talking on the phone to other people or him at various Kemper 
   crime scenes looking at his handiwork. There is some blood and gore 
   on view here (slit throats and decapitated heads are the 
   specialties), but most of it is after the deed has been done. The 
   acting never rises above the level of a bad TV movie, the worst being 
   Christopher Stapleton as Detective Harris, who sounds like he's 
   channeling his inner Clint Eastwood (all he does is talk in a low, 
   whispering monotone). As far as serial killer films go, <B><A HREF="kemper_the_coed_killer_2008b.htm">KEMPER:
    THE CO-ED KILLER</A></B> is minor league stuff. It's not as bad as 
   the recent Ulli Lommel serial killer crap, but not as 
   professional-looking as the recent <A HREF="#BTK2007">Michael Feifer stuff</A>.
    As a straight-ahead thriller, it is just simply awful and contains 
   some of the worst police procedurals I've ever seen in a movie. Any

    A young couple are necking in a car when the woman says she thought

   the two of them, so they continue making out. He's wrong of course 
   and, as they remove their clothes and get down to business, the 
   killer strikes, shooting them point blank with a pistol and dragging 
   the woman's body away, poking her nipples and bare skin with the 
   sharp blade of a long knife and finishing by shoving a freshly broken

   D'Abbraccio), telling her that two theology students were murdered 
   last night while making love. Two more murders by the same killer. 
   Chiara tells Christiana that their father, Professor Marelli 
   (Riccardo Perrotti; <B><A HREF="#Psychic1977">THE PSYCHIC</A></B> -

   him at the crime scene that the most important aspect of criminology 
   is study. The Professor tells her that if she saw the condition of 
   these two bodies, she would vomit all over her criminology papers. 
   (Both Christiana and Chiara are in the same criminology classes and 
   the Professor wonders out loud how Chiara seemingly knows about the 
   murders before he does? That is a good question, one you should 
   remember.). Christiana decided to make these string of killings the 
   main subject of her final thesis and while the Professor finds it 
   unusual for a woman, especially his daughter, to be interested in 
   such matters, he agrees to help her.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A detective finds a prescription for a nervous disorder drug at the 
   scene of the crime and asks the Professor to give him a psychological 
   profile on the serial killer and the Professor agrees, but not before 
   he collects all the facts pertinent to the case. We then see coroner 
   Dr. Alex (Giovanni Visentin; <B><A HREF="card_player_2004.htm">THE 
   CARD PLAYER</A></B> - 2004) performing an autopsy on a male cadaver, 
   as the Professor and Christiana watch (she looks like she could 
   upchuck at any moment). When the Professor leaves, Dr. Alex asks 
   Christiana why a beautiful woman such as herself is interested in 
   dead bodies, but she doesn't answer him, staring at the incisions he 
   just made in the cadaver's chest. To further upset her, he lets her 
   see the dead man's body from the night before. He is missing his 
   penis (apparently, the killer cut it off and also removed the woman's 
   vagina, leaving a twig in its place!). Dr. Alex then takes Christiana 
   for a drink and she apologizes to him for acting like a fool. He 
   tells her not to worry about it, even though he is the coroner, he 
   nearly vomited when he saw the condition of the two bodies. Dr. Alex 
   then asks Christiana out on a date and she accepts, so they go to the 
   movies.&nbsp; After the date, Dr. Alex drives Christiana back to her 
   apartment and she tells him before this relationship goes any 
   further, he has to meet her parents. He says, &quot;Look, if it 
   doesn't cost me anything, then I'll come,&quot; (Classy guy, that Dr. 
   Alex!). Dr. Alex tells Christiana that he's an orphan, but mothers 
   love him, so Christiana takes his hand and leads him to her 
   apartment, thinking he is going to meet her parents. When they get to 
   her apartment, it is dark and empty. Dr. Alex asks her where her 
   parents are and she says, &quot;They live in Rome!&quot; They both 
   share a good laugh and then they have sex!&nbsp; While they are both 
   in bed after the deed, Christiana says this is her first time with a 
   doctor and he has an advantage because he knows where to put his 
   hands (!). After professing their complete liking of each other, Dr. 
   Alex asks her to please leave these murders alone, it is not healthy 
   for a beautiful woman to be interested in such things. Taking it as a 
   warning rather than a suggestion (I'm not even sure which one it is), 
   Christiana gets upset and leaves the bed, telling Dr. Alex she can't 
   leave it alone, it's part of her criminology thesis. Dr. Alex advises 
   her to change her thesis, because nothing good will come from this. 
   Does he know something Christiana (and the viewer) doesn't? 
   Christiana refuses and tells Dr. Alex to stay out of her business. 
   She has an appointment with a forensics expert and will see him later.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The forensics expert tells Christiana that the pistol used in the 
   latest killings was the same pistol used in all the other murders. 
   Based on marking on the spent cartridges, he is positive it came from 
   the same weapon: a Beretta pistol. Dr. Alex tells Christiana that all 
   seven shots to the woman's body were fatal shots, two in the heart, 
   four in the lungs and one in the liver, the killer was an exceptional 
   marksman who knows his anatomy. The Professor has seemingly finished 
   his psychological profile of the killer, reading off a piece of paper 
   and telling Christiana and Chiara that the killer is a person who is 
   above suspicion in normal life, perhaps someone with a good 
   reputation with the ability to use a knife well, probably a scalpel, 
   which led him to examine the medical field. Or an engraver, butcher 
   or tattoo artist. It turns out the Professor was reading from 
   Christiana's thesis and he doesn't agree with it, jokingly (?) asking 
   her why she didn't paint the killer as a Boy Scout. The Professor 
   tells her the killer could be anyone, the victim isn't an enemy, it's 
   no lovers quarrel, nor a jealous husband. The killer is a maniac and 
   unfortunately he will strike again, telling Christiana that the rest 
   of her thesis is just bad literature (Way to break it to her gently, 
   Dad!). Christiana tells Chiara that their father just tore her a new 
   asshole, but Chiara says he's probably in a bad mood, someone must 
   have made him angry in class, she knows how he gets. We then see 
   someone in a vehicle following Christiana and Chiara as they are 
   walking down the street. It turns out it is not a car, but an 
   ambulance and Christiana sees it parked across the street from her 
   apartment, but she (and we) can't see who is driving it. Christiana 
   spends the night revising her thesis when she gets a phone call from 
   someone with a raspy voice, who hangs up on her. A look of worry 
   fills her face, so she chains her front door and the following 
   morning reports the phone call to the Commissioner of Police 
   (Francesco Capitano). He tells her to drop it, it was probably a 
   wrong number or someone playing a joke on her. He also tells her to 
   change her criminology thesis if she knows what is good for her. Why 
   is everyone so interested in her thesis and why do they want her to 
   change it?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Things get very strange when Christiana goes to a psychiatrist, Dr. 
   Franco Benincasa (Luigi Mezzanotte; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#ThorConqueror83">THOR
    THE CONQUEROR</A></B> - 1983), under the ruse that she is having 
   emotional problems, in hopes of getting some information in what make 
   a serial killer tick. Dr. Benincasa asks her why she came to him, 
   since he is listed in the Yellow Pages as a gynecologist (!), so she 
   fesses up, telling him she was hoping to get some insight on the 
   &quot;Couples Killer.&quot; Dr. Benincasa then pulls out a large 
   sharp knife, waves it in the air and screams to Christiana, &quot;Get 
   out! Get OUT!!!&quot; (I told you things were getting strange). When 
   Christiana leaves his office, she realizes that Chiara is no longer 
   waiting for her. The nurse tells Christiana that her friend felt ill 
   and left, so she takes a taxi home.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Feeling in her bones that Dr. Benincasa is the killer (Talk about a 
   huge coincidence!), Christiana follows him to a tavern, where she 
   sees him get into a car with another man and leave. She then sees a 
   biker chick enter the tavern and her interest gets the better of her, 
   so she enters the tavern. All the men inside take a strange interest 
   in Christiana, so she makes her way to the bar and sits down next to 
   the biker chick. She discovers that everyone in the tavern belongs to 
   a &quot;club&quot;, so she hires the biker babe for 100,000 lire to 
   be her &quot;guide&quot; to show her what this &quot;club&quot; does. 
   It's very confusing, but it looks like this club spies on couples 
   making love in their cars, photographing and taping them (maybe even 
   going as far as to drug them!), using the photographs and recording 
   to blackmail them (At least that is what I think they are doing. Like 
   I said, it's confusing.). The biker babe then takes Christiana back 
   to the tavern, telling her that if she ever sees her again, she's a 
   dead woman (What???). The next morning, Chiara tells Christiana that 
   another couple was killed last night, only they were knifed to death 
   and the police believe the killer must be soaked in their blood.&nbsp;
    Could this have any connection to the bloody clothes Christiana 
   found in her kitchen garbage can, put there by Dr. Alex, who didn't 
   want to talk about it?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   real-life unsolved serial killer case (You need to read my <B><A HREF="#MonsterFlorence1985">THE
    MONSTER OF FLORENCE</A></B> review, because I hate repeating 
   myself). I have wanted to see this film since reading about it in the 
   essential tome <B><A HREF="blood_and_black_lace_book.htm">BLOOD &amp; 
   BLACK LACE</A></B>, but it was next to impossible to find. Luckily, 
   someone told me that Rogue Video offered this film in anamorphic 
   widescreen in its original Italian with easy-to-read yellow subtitles 
   and I'm glad to report it looks fantastic (Be aware that it is a 
   DVD-R. I know some people may be troubled by that, but not me.), but 
   it looks like some of the more extreme violence was edited out (the 
   sight of the man without a penis; the twig up the vagina; etc.), 
   as&nbsp; there are jumps in the music score, a sure sign that trims 
   were made after the film was completed. Still, there is more than 
   enough of the red stuff on view, such as Christiana finding one of 
   the killer's victims pinned to the ceiling, blood flowing out his 
   mouth and into Christiana's mouth as she is screaming (hard to 
   watch). The film is also populated by some strange characters, put in 
   the film to point fingers at them as possibly being the killer, but 
   it is obvious most of them are nothing but red herrings. There is 
   also plenty of female nudity, especially by Mariangela D'Abbraccio as 
   Christiana. Like I said in the beginning of this review, sometimes 
   all I need is a film with exploitable elements to make me happy and 
   this flick fits the bill nicely. Besides everything I have already 
   mentioned, there is also a s&eacute;ance performed by a male medium 
   (Roberto Sanna), who tries to contact one of the serial killer's 
   victims in hopes they will be able to identify the killer. It doesn't 
   end well. We see the graphic killing of a naked couple making love in

   Giorgio Mainardi (George Hilton) and his rich bitch wife, Norma 
   (Teresa Velasquez), are having marriage problems. Norma has cut his 
   bank account off, so Giorgio storms out of the house. He stops at a 
   phone booth to call his mistress when he spots a killer (the 
   skull-faced Michel Antoine) disposing a dead female body in a river 
   (we earlier see the killer load the dead woman's body into a VW 
   Beetle and he cops a feel after positioning her in the passenger 
   seat!). Giorgio blackmails the killer into murdering his wife and 
   making it look like a kidnapping (he takes the killer's monogrammed 
   lighter and will only give it back to him once the deed is done) and 
   Giorgio plans on getting a big ransom payday from Norma's wealthy 
   father. Being a psychopath, the killer (we never learn his name, but 
   his lighter has the initials &quot;D.A.&quot; on it, certainly a 
   tip-of-the-hat to giallo master Dario Argento) strangles Norma and 
   puts her corpse in the trunk of his car, while Giorgio is at a party 
   building an alibi. Complications ensue when a young couple, Luca 
   (Alessio Orano) and Laura (Cristina Galbo), steal the killer's car 
   and take it for a joyride, unaware that there's a dead body in the 
   trunk. The killer steals one of Norma's neighbor's cars and goes 
   hunting for the couple and his car. Meanwhile, when Giorgio gets 
   home, he finds the police waiting for him. <A HREF="killer_must_kill_again_1975b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/killer must kill again dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="168" HEIGHT="249" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>The
    police inspector (Eduardo Fajardo) is suspicious of the whole crime, 
   which makes Giorgio nervous. The biggest question is why the 
   kidnapper would steal a neighbor's car when neighbors saw the 
   kidnapper's car parked in front of Giorgio's house (It's also a 
   question that Giorgio can't answer since he's unaware of the 
   complications the killer is going through). Luca and Laura have a few 
   close calls (including being stopped by a cop who comes very close to 
   looking in the trunk) while the killer stays one step behind them 
   cleaning up their messes (He pays off a gas station attendant when 
   the couple skips out on paying for a fill-up). Giorgio sweats it out 
   back at his house, while the police inspector begins piecing the 
   puzzle together. When Luca and Laura spend a night at a deserted 
   seaside villa, Luca takes the car to get some food and the killer 
   enters the villa and rapes Laura. When Luca returns (with a new 
   female friend), Laura breaks free and stabs the killer to death. 
   After the police inspector questions Luca and Laura, he lays a trap 
   which he hopes will bring Giorgio's true colors to the forefront. 
   Giorgio falls for it and ends up being charged with much more than 
   his role in his wife's murder. He should have gotten rid of that 
   damned lighter.&nbsp; This Italian/French co-production, directed and

   - 1974), is a decent thriller, even though there isn't anyone here 
   who can remotely be considered likable. We all know from the 
   beginning that Giorgio and the killer are bad men, but Luca and Laura 
   fail to build much sympathy, especially when we find out that Luca 
   stole the car just to get into Laura's pants and that Laura (who may 
   be a virgin) uses that knowledge to cocktease Luca into doing her 
   bidding. Toss in robbing a gas station attendant and Luca hitting on 
   a blonde (Femi Benussi) he picks up on the side of the road when he's 
   running an errand for the blueball-inducing Laura, and these two kids 
   look no better than Giorgio or the killer. When the killer rapes 
   Laura, it's intercut with scenes of Luca screwing the blonde in the 
   back seat of the killer's car. It's a powerful and ironic scene, but 
   it would have been much more powerful if the kids were at least 
   likable. As it stands, <B><A HREF="killer_must_kill_again_1975b.htm">THE
    KILLER MUST KILL AGAIN</A></B> is a sleazy, but not very bloody or 
   violent thriller (there's only one very bloody murder and a face 
   slashing that happens near the end of the film) that holds your 
   attention thanks to some tense situations. Although categorized as a 
   giallo by many reviewers, this film doesn't contain the elements 
   usually found in most giallo films (i.e. mysterious gloved killer; 
   POV shots; lots of bloody killings), though director Cozzi bathes a 
   lot of scenes in yellow. Try to count how many yellow objects you 
   observe in this to see what I mean. If it were a drinking game,

   tonight has already happened.&quot;). Someone tries to drop a heavy 
   wooden beam on Patrick, but misses, which causes a lot of 
   finger-pointing amongst the partygoers. Things turn worse when Kim is 
   stabbed in the back and killed while performing Shakespeare's Romeo 
   And Juliet on stage. The group decide to call the police and then 
   leave, but find the phone line dead and all the doors and windows 
   locked, with no avenue of escape. After pointing fingers at each 
   other once again, the group then realizes that no one there knows who 
   the mystery man is, so they all search for him. Patrick relates a 
   story to Vivian about how a similar incident happened at this theater 
   100 years earlier (to the day) and everyone inside was murdered. Is 
   it possible that his family is cursed? (Patrick tells Vivian, 
   &quot;Once every hundred years, there's horror and death in my 
   family, brought about in an insane manner.&quot;). Doris is the next 
   one killed when the masked killer crushes her sternum with a heavy 
   sliding wooden door. The killer next tries to dispose of Vivian (with 
   a cigarette to her face), but Russell intervenes and they later find 
   him hanging from a rope by his neck. Patrick finds an old family 
   parchment and the drawings on it seem to fortell the order and modes 
   of the deaths. Rebecca is next to die when the killer strips her 
   naked, stabs her repeatedly in the vagina with a switchblade, hammers 
   a spike into her left hand and then poses her and Doris' naked bodies 
   on stage like some perverted wax figure display. As more people end 
   up dead, we discover who the killer(s) really is (are), but a 
   surprise finale shows the killer(s) may indeed have a family curse on 
   their head(s), and that curse takes an incestuous turn in the crypt 
   in the canvernous dungeon of the theater.&nbsp; Strikingly similar in 
   tone to Peter Walker's <B><A HREF="flesh_and_blood_show_1972.htm">THE 
   FLESH AND BLOOD SHOW</A></B> (1972) and Michele Soavi's <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Stage Fright">STAGE
    FRIGHT</A></B> (1986), this Italian giallo, directed and co-scripted 
   by Giuseppe Bennati, is less bloody than either of those films, but 
   packed with nudity, infidelity (it's hard to keep up with who's 
   screwing who) and a pretty decent mystery. Although some of the 
   dialogue is risable (One of the guests says, &quot;It looks like 
   Dracula's summer home!&quot; when they first step into the theater), 
   the plot is actually very well done and involving. Although talky at 
   times, this film depends on those talky sections to supply the viewer 
   with clues, so listen carefully. While most of the murders are 
   bloodless, there are scenes that are hard to watch, mainly for what's 
   implied rather than what is shown. Rebecca's vaginal penetration by 
   switchblade is never shown, but the killer is shown stripping Rebecca 
   and cutting off her panties with the knife just before he does the 
   deed, leaving little doubt about what he's doing, as we watch him 
   thrust the knife and the camera pans to Rebecca's anguished, 
   pain-filled face. It's the film's standout sequence. Director Bennati 
   (this was his last film; he passed away in 2006) gives us all the 
   giallo staples: A masked and gloved killer, plenty of deaths, an 
   inescapable location and a slowly-unravelling mystery, all served up 
   in a highly-watchable package. It should also be noted that every 
   woman here has a full-frontal nude scene, although I believe Janet 
   Agren used a body double. Also featuring Luigi Antonio Guerra (<B><A HREF="#KillerMustKillAgain">THE

   (2014) -</B> Clown horror movies are all the rage, but this one tries 
   to be different because the clown angle is but a small part of the 
   whole story and it's not really a horror film. Different doesn't 
   always translate as being good, though. Ben Hood (Dakota Morrissiey) 
   and Jo O'Hare (Kierney Nelson) are kissing in a car when Jo notices 
   something is wrong with Ben. Ben fesses-up and tells Jo that he 
   cheated on her when she was in college, so Jo breaks up immediately 
   with him and won't answer his many phone calls or answer his text 
   messages. Jo's mother Jill (Elizabeth Brewster) and father Dan (Adam 
   Vernier) are more upset with her for coming home at 3:00AM then 
   having her heart broken, but Daddy is a tad more understanding. Jo 
   has been having a really hard time in her life lately: She blew out a 
   knee and lost her track scholarship to college and has to pay to go 
   back on her own (if she wants to go back). Now Mom has forbade her 
   from leaving the house (A grown woman <A HREF="kruel_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/kruel advance poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="231" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>grounded
    to the house? Hey, Mom: Fuck you! I'm an adult.); she is only 
   allowed to leave when she babysits for young boys Brandon (Cooper 
   Henderson) and Elliott Walters (Matthew Weidle) to make enough money 
   to (maybe) go back to college. While she is babysitting (apparently 
   they like to be called &quot;nannies&quot; now) and on the phone 
   talking to a girlfriend, the ice cream truck comes up the street and 
   she gives the kids money to go get their favorite ice cream. Elliott 
   comes running back all ashen-faced with the money still in his hand, 
   but he refuses to talk about what happened. Matthew has no idea, so 
   Jo goes outside to talk to the ice cream man. She is in for quite the 
   surprise when she sees Willie (J.T. Chinn) is a freakish-looking 
   clown (he has ice cream cones painted over his eye areas). He also 
   won't talk about what happened, but instead puts on a puppet show (!) 
   saying how cute Jo is, which freaks her out. The following day, Ben 
   shows up in the Walters' front yard while Jo is playing with the kids 
   and apologizes once again for cheating on her. This is his only way 
   to talk to her since she won't talk to him on the phone or answer his 
   text messages (Kids today and their text messaging!). While they are 
   arguing, Elliott ends up missing, which results in a massive police 
   search complete with helicopters. When the police come up 
   empty-handed, detectives interrogate Jo and infer that she may be 
   involved in the kidnapping. Yes, Jo is having a very bad time in her 
   life right now (To add insult to injury, Elliott's mother [Colleen 
   Yorke] slaps her in the face). Ben feels partly responsible because 
   he was keeping Jo too busy to keep proper eyes on the children (he 
   is). When Ben tells Jo about a crazy man he saw fishing without a 
   worm or even a hook, she thinks back to Elliott and the thing that 
   happened between him and Willie and becomes convinced that the clown 
   pervert is responsible. Ben calls Jo and says he found the ice cream 
   man, so she jumps into Ben's Jeep and they follow him, but Ben is a 
   prick and drives right next to the ice cream truck (even though Jo 
   begs him not to) and Willie sticks his tongue out at them. Jo tells 
   her story to the police, but they believe Elliott is dead from 
   drowning in an unfortunate accident (a pile of the clothes he was 
   wearing were next to the local lake) and discard Jo's accusations. 
   Ben has discovered where Willie lives and plans on breaking into his 
   house that night (Willie is a security guard at night) to find 
   evidence that Willie is a pedophile. Ben and Jo go inside his house 
   (his front door isn't even locked, which threw up a red flag to me) 
   and find walls full of freaky photos (believe me, they are weird!) 
   and lots of toys from the 1940's &amp; 1950's sitting on shelves. 
   They start turning on by themselves (like some burglar alarm, but 
   much creepier), forcing Ben and Jo to leave the house. As they are 
   leaving, a figure approaches Ben's car and breaks his driver side 
   window. The next morning, Jo goes jogging (What happened to Mom 
   grounding her?) and Willie unsuccessfully tries to kill her with a 
   knife. Jo goes to the police, who say that Willie has disappeared and 
   Ben is now packing heat. Jo and Ben are now a couple again and Willie 
   breaks into her house, but it all turns out to be a nightmare by Jo 
   (the image of Jo and Willie on opposite sides of a door in the ad 
   materials is taken from that nightmare sequence). Jo takes a shower 
   (she has nice perky breasts; wait I can do a puppet show explaining 
   it!) and then cries about how her life turned out, but Daddy makes 
   her feel better about herself. She jumps into Ben's distinctive 
   yellow Jeep to find him dead and Willie appears behind her and 
   chloroforms her until she in knocked-out. She wakes up and finds 
   herself tied to some bathroom in a seasonal motel in the woods (and 
   this is out-of-season). A still-alive Elliott is there, too, in 
   another room. They are in the middle of the Okefenokee Swamp (filmed 
   in Jacksonville &amp; Orlando, Florida). Jo breaks free and hides in 
   the swamp (She text messages Daddy, but the cell phone goes dead), 
   but a bullhorn-talking, ATV-riding Willie makes her give herself up 
   when he says he will kill Elliott. He shoots Jo with a tranquilizer 
   dart and when she wakes up, Jo is tied to the floor where many lit 
   candles surround her and has had most of her body painted. Willie 
   wants him, Jo and Elliott to be a family. Dad has the Sheriff (Tom 
   Riska) call the telephone company and triangulate the last message Jo 
   sent to him before her phone died (She only has one of those phones 
   that sends text messages, but doesn't make phone calls and Dad was 
   about to give her a real cell phone today [Never heard of such a 
   thing. How can it be a phone and not make phone calls?]). Dad gets 
   the information and drives out to the area, where he knocks on 
   Willie's door and he answers (no one knows what Willie looks like 
   without his clown makeup). Willie tells Dad that he hasn't seen his 
   daughter, even though<A HREF="kruel_2014.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/kruel dvd front8 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   she is behind the door with a knife to her throat. When Dad notices 
   Ben's yellow Jeep behind the motel, he calls the Sheriff and breaks 
   down the front door of Willie's room with an axe, but Willie makes 
   him drop it when he has a butcher knife to Jo's throat. He slices 
   Jo's throat anyway (Clowns are funny that way) and we see Dad and 
   Willie fight as shadows on the wall (the only real creativity in the 
   film), so we are not sure who has won the fight. Turns out that Dad 
   was the winner and he tries to stem the bleeding from Jo's throat. Jo 
   wakes up in the hospital and can't talk, so she writes down how her 
   father and Elliott are. Her mother says they are fine. Jo then 
   writes, &quot;Willie?&quot; and Mom tells her not to worry about it. 
   His body was never found, so Jo and her family move to a different 
   State. Jo then does a final voice-over as a dedication to the dead 
   Ben, which would give diabetes to a thin man who has eaten properly 
   all his life.&nbsp; This is the freshman effort by 
   director/screenwriter/co-producer Robert Henderson (it seems a lot of 
   Henderson family members worked both in front and behind the cameras) 
   and this film's really major distraction is the simply awful acting 
   ability of Dakota Morrissiey as Ben. He shows about as much emotion 
   as a rock (I think quartz has him beat) and talks in annoying 
   monotone, even when he is in danger. The film suffers greatly every 
   time he is on screen, so it was actually a relief when Jo found him 
   dead. Too bad it comes during the film's final 20 minutes. Most of 
   the other actors are below average, but when compared to Morrissiey's 
   acting, they all look like Laurence Olivier. Since this is a 
   psychological thriller and not a horror film, there's not much blood 
   until the final third and Kierney Nelson has a nice rack, but her 
   nude scene is much too quick. The only real plus in this film is J.T. 
   Chinn as Willie Kool (yes, that is the last name they gave him 
   according to the final credits). He brings the right amount of menace 
   and creepiness to his role, although the clown angle takes up 
   precious little time. If all the actors were this good, I would 
   recommend this film, but this is a really long 104 minutes due to the 
   bad and over-acting. This film tries to show us what it takes to be a 
   family, warts and all but, unfortunately, the cast of unknown actors 
   are not up to the task and makes Jo's family unit seem shrill and 
   unrealistic (What mother grounds her college daughter?). Since this 
   is Robert Henderson's first film, I'm willing to cut him some slack 
   (all the technical aspects are fine) and if he had a cast of talented 
   character actors, the film would have been much, much better. I'll 
   give Henderson a pass this time, but his second film better wow me.

   (1983) -</B> In this twisty thriller, it's hard to keep up with who's 
   telling the truth and who is a big fat liar. The film opens with 
   Stuart Russell (Bruce Davison; <B><A HREF="willard_1971.htm">WILLARD</A></B> 
   - 1971) coming home one night, only to discover that two robbers are 
   invading his family's gated mansion. After grabbing a shotgun, Stuart 
   runs upstairs to discover that his mother and father are already dead 
   and the robbers are about to rape and kill his sister Elizabeth 
   (Julie Philips). Stuart blasts the two robbers with the shotgun and 
   saves Elizabeth, but she ends up a babbling basket case who is 
   committed to an asylum. Four years pass and we are introduced to 
   struggling actress Robyn Wallace (Ann Dusenberry; <B><A HREF="cutter_and_bone_1981.htm">CUTTER
    AND BONE</A></B> - 1981). She has just walked off the set of a 
   low-budget zombie film after the director tries to trick her into 
   doing a nude scene, which is against her principles (The film's 
   producer, Harry [genre vet Dick Miller], tells her, &quot;Tits sell 
   tickets!&quot; to which Robyn replies, &quot;Not these tits!&quot;). 
   Broke and unable to pay her rent, not to mention being fired from her

    agent Jessica Brenner (Gail Strickland) to star as Elizabeth in a 
   film version of the Russell Family tragedy. After telling Robyn that 
   Elizabeth committed suicide a year earlier by slitting her throat 
   with scissors and asking Robyn a few suspicious questions, like 
   &quot;How's your relationship with your family?&quot; (it's not 
   good), Jessica tells Robyn that the rehearsals are going to be 
   unusual (that's an understatement) and that she must sequester 
   herself away from all outside contact to get &quot;inside&quot; 
   Elizabeth's head. What follows next is a plot that contains so many 
   twists and turns, you will need a scorecard to keep track. After 
   meeting Elizabeth's psychiatrist, Dr. Bartlett (Clu Gulager; <B><A HREF="return_of_the_living_dead_1986.htm">RETURN
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> - 1985), and doing some filmed rehearsals 
   in character as Elizabeth in the asylum, Robyn is told by Jessica 
   that financing for the film has fallen through and the movie will not 
   be made. Robyn then meets Stuart, who tells her that Elizabeth is 
   still alive and that Jessica is not a casting agent at all, but 
   actually a psychiatrist at Elizabeth's mental hospital! Jessica is 
   working in concert with Stuart's evil Uncle Charles (Stacy Keach Sr.) 
   and they plan on using Robyn's rehearsal footage to convince lawyers 
   that Elizabeth is not sane enough to claim her inheritance. Stuart 
   convinces Robyn to impersonate Elizabeth in real life to get even 
   with his Uncle Charles, but it turns out that Stuart and Jessica are 
   actually working in tandem, as the real Elizabeth is then murdered 
   and it is made to look like suicide. Robyn is then committed to the 
   same asylum where Elizabeth has spent the last four years and is 
   constantly kept in a doped-up state to stop her from revealing what 
   actually happened. That's just the beginning, though, as this film 
   displays so much pretzel logic, Hitchcock and Argento would be proud 
   (Hint: Elizabeth was Stuart's wife, not his sister).&nbsp; As 
   directed/produced/scripted by brothers Ken &amp; Jim Wheat (who 
   directed/scripted the TV movie <B><A HREF="ewoks_the_battle_for_endor_1985.htm">EWOKS:
    THE BATTLE FOR ENDOR</A></B> [1985] and the horror anthology <B><A HREF="after_midnight_1989.htm">AFTER

   diverse films as <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Return 1980">THE RETURN</A></B> 
   [1980], <B><A HREF="fly_2_1989.htm">THE FLY II</A></B> [1989] and <B><A HREF="pitch_black_2000.htm">PITCH
    BLACK</A></B> [2000]), <B>LIES</B> is an excellent thriller that 
   keeps you guessing right up to the final shot. The subplot involving 
   Robyn's on-again, off-again scriptwriter boyfriend Eric's (Terrence 
   Knox; <B><A HREF="children_of_the_corn_2_1993.htm">CHILDREN OF THE 
   CORN II: THE FINAL SACRIFICE</A></B> - 1993) search for her when she 
   ends up missing doesn't come across as forced or phony, but as 
   something that could actually play out in real life. There are so 
   many double and triple-crosses (and beyond) that the viewer really 
   has to pay attention to keep up. Bert Remsen, as Harry, delivers the 
   best line in the film. After he and Eric visit Robyn in the mental 
   hospital, where Jessica shows them Robyn's rehearsal footage and 
   expects them to believe it is real, Harry later confesses to Eric 
   that he knew Robyn was only acting, but amusingly tells Eric, 
   &quot;Any actress that can deliver a performance like we saw on that 
   videotape can make her agent a bundle!&quot; Great stuff. While it's 
   apparent that the Wheats were working with a small budget, everyone 
   turns in terrific performances, especially Dusenberry (who has a 
   topless shower scene, proving she's nothing like the character she's 
   portraying) and there's a surprisingly suspenseful elevator sequence 
   that rivals any giallo film you may have seen. I really don't know 
   why this film isn't more popular, because it's one of the best 
   American thrillers of the early 80's. See it if you ever get the 
   chance to get your hands on a copy. Also starring Douglas Leonard,

   Regional (filmed in Florida) low-budget reality-based crime thriller 
   based of the exploits of the John Ashley Gang (no, not the late

   1920's Florida during Prohibition. The movie is told through the eyes 
   of Laura's (Karen Black; <B><A HREF="pyx_1973.htm">THE PYX</A></B> -

   the partner and lover of John Ashley (singer/actor Fabian Forte; <B><A HREF="revenge_of_the_zombie_1981.htm">REVENGE

   narration and stock footage of 20's &amp; 30's gangster films, that 
   John Ashley died at the age of 32, but what became of Laura? Her 
   mother tells her daughter's story, beginning with Laura's childhood, 
   when little Laura (Evie Karafotias) and best friend little John

   forget their dirt-poor upbringing in the swamps of Florida. As a 
   matter of fact, they made a game out of everything, right up till the 
   end. When John is sought by the police for the murder of a Seminole 
   Indian (it was actually an accident), he and Laura hide out in a tent 
   in the Everglades, helped by<A HREF="little_laura_and_big_john_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/little laura and big john poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="184" HEIGHT="286" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   John's brother, Bob (Jerry Albert). John eventually turns himself in 
   to Sheriff Bob Baker (the late Paul Gleason: <B><A HREF="he_knows_youre_alone_1980.htm">HE
    KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE</A></B> - 1980) at Bob's urging, thinking that 
   the case will be thrown out of court for lack of evidence (the 
   Indian's body was mostly devoured by alligators), but when it looks 
   like things aren't going John's way and he might be spending a lot of 
   time in jail before a trial even starts, John breaks out of jail with 
   Bob's help and a $100 reward is posted for his capture. John forms a 
   gang with Laura, Bob, Ray (Ben Rossi) and Clarence (Lee Warren) and 
   they rob a bank in the town of Stuart, netting themselves $5,000, but 
   during the getaway Ray accidentally shoots John in the right eye. 
   John is recaptured and put back in jail (He now sports a black 
   eyepatch, which magically switches from his right eye to his left eye 
   and back again in one scene!). Bob once again tries to break John out 
   of jail, but fails and Bob dies in a hail of bullets (and killing a 
   couple of deputies in the process). John is convicted of bank robbery 
   and is sentenced to eighteen years hard labor at the notorious 
   Raiford State Penitentiary, but he easily escapes (It's hilarious how 
   easy it was!) and there is now a $500 reward for his capture. John 
   and Laura hide out in New York City and begin to get homesick, so 
   they begin robbing barber shops, bars and diners from Philadelphia to 
   Washington D.C. to finance their trip back to Florida. John gets his 
   old gang back together, with the new addition of Hanford (Kenny 
   Miller: <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Blood Stalkers">BLOOD STALKERS</A></B> 
   - 1975) and try their hands at rum running using a boat along the 
   Florida coastline. That doesn't work out too well for them (they are 
   the most inept crooks I have ever seen), so they decide to rob banks 
   again, this time the Bank of Pompano. When John's Pa (Phil Philbin) 
   is killed by the law for protecting his son, John and his gang 
   step-up their robbing spree and John now has a $1,000 reward for his 
   capture, dead or alive. John and his gang are gunned-down in an 
   ambush set up by Sheriff Baker, leaving Laura without a man for the 
   first time in her life, turning her into a hopeless alcoholic. Let 
   that be a lesson to you kids!&nbsp; This is a ridiculously disjointed 
   and badly edited crime film, co-directed and co written by Luke 
   Moberly and Bob Woodburn who, thankfully, separately or collectively, 
   never made another film. <B><A HREF="little_laura_and_big_john_1972b.htm">LITTLE

   Raiford Prison. I felt like shooting myself in the eye before 
   realizing that I was born with only one good eye!). Both Fabian Forte 
   and Karen Black are terrible here, even if they really don't have 
   much to do. For an R-Rated crime thriller, there's very little bloody 
   violence and precious little nudity, except for a nude girl on the

   Carol Hammond (Florinda Bolkan; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#LastHouseBeach">LAST
    HOUSE ON THE BEACH</A></B> - 1978) has a recurring nightmare that 
   begins with her running down the aisle of a passenger train trying to 
   open the compartments, but being ignored by the people inside, like 
   she is invisible. The aisle then transforms into the corridor of an 
   apartment complex, full of naked writhing bodies that Carol must run 
   through. At the end of the corridor is a big red bed, and waiting on 
   that bed is a naked Julia Durer (Anita Strindberg; <B><A HREF="#WhoSawHerDie">WHO
    SAW HER DIE?</A></B> - 1972), a neighbor of Carol's. The nightmare 
   finishes with Julia and Carol engaging in some lesbian sex (Hey, are 
   we sure this is a nightmare? More like a wet dream if you ask me!). 
   Carol's psychiatrist, Dr. Kerr (George Rigaud), tells Carol that what 
   she is dreaming is probably her innermost desires manifesting 
   themselves. Carol is an uptight, &quot;proper&quot; woman, whose dry, 
   boring dinner parties are ruined by Julia's loud, music- filled sex 
   parties in her apartment next door, but we get the feeling that Carol 
   would much rather be over at Julia's place than having a stuffy 
   dinner with her lawyer husband, Frank (Jean Sorel; <B><A HREF="#MurderBlueWorld">MURDER

   - 1972) and Sgt. Brandon (Alberto De Mendoza; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#HumanCobras1971">HUMAN
    COBRAS</A></B> - 1971) are brought in to investigate Julia's death 
   and they eventually question Carol (who believes she killed Julia 
   with her one-of-a-kind letter opener). Frank (who is having an affair 
   with a yet-unknown woman) becomes worried that someone is trying to 
   set-up Carol by using her dreams as a blueprint for murder, so he 
   goes to Edmond (who owns the high-priced law firm that Frank works 
   for) to gain access to Inspector Corvin's files, especially when he 
   notices Carol's fur coat and letter opener at the crime scene. As we 
   will soon find out, the symbolisms and people in Carol's dreams will 
   be key in unlocking the murder mystery. The audio tapes of her 
   sessions with Dr. Kerr hold the clues to the murders. As more people 
   within Carol's circle end up dead and Carol herself is viciously 
   stabbed by a red-headed man, Inspector Corvin will get involved in a 
   blackmail plot, a hunchback and various other undesirables before 
   unmasking the real killer, who may or may not be suffering from a 
   case of schizophrenia.&nbsp; This excellent giallo, the first one to 
   be directed and scripted by genre master Lucio Fulci (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#DontTortureDuck72">DON'T

   - 1990), contains many striking and unsettling scenes, as well as 
   some very unusual characters. The strangest character of all is 
   Stanley Baker's Inspector Corvin, who has a bad habit of whistling at 
   the most inopportune times, like when questioning suspects or 
   standing over the bodies of murder victims. It's quite disorienting 
   for the audience. Above all, this is a film about secrets. It seems 
   everyone here is harboring at least one (Frank and his mistress; 
   Carol's past; Edmond's suspicions about Frank; etc.), that it's quite 
   possible that anyone here could be the killer. There are also some 
   truly disturbing images on view, including the shocking view of three 
   live dogs splayed open in a lab, their beating hearts exposed while 
   they wimper in pain. It not only takes the viewer by surprise, it 
   also leaves a lasting impression in your mind that won't likely leave 
   for quite some time. While bloody and violent in spots, <B><A HREF="lizard_in_a_womans_skin_1971c.htm">A
    LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN</A></B> (what a great title!) is also one 
   of Lucio Fulci's most cerebral films and will take a lot of fans of 
   his later gore films by surprise. This is a lyrical, haunting film 
   (scored by Ennio Morricone) that offers a lot of brain, as well as 
   eye, candy. Some of the images and camera set-ups are so beautifully 
   done (especially the large shadow of the swan chasing Carol), that 
   they could be paintings and the plot moves at a brisk pace without 
   seeming far-fetched. This is one of the best early 70's giallo films 
   (released theatrically in the U.S. by American International Pictures

    Jane's young daughter Lucy (Veronica Zinny) is sick and tired of her 
   mother leaving her alone to baby-sit for her younger brother every 
   time Mom's away screwing her boyfriend (Dad's always away on 
   business). One day, when Lucy calls her mother at the apartment to 
   come home and spend time with her children and she doesn't answer 
   (Mom wants nothing to interfere with her time with Fred, as waiting 
   for him is just as important to her as screwing him!), she decides to 
   teach Mom a deadly lesson for being away so often. She drowns her 
   brother in the bathtub (!) and then phones her, saying her son has 
   been in a bad accident. Jane leaves the mansion a nervous wreck, so 
   Fred insists on driving her home in her car. Jane is such a wreck 
   that Fred can't keep his eyes on the road, resulting in a deadly car 
   accident, where the car hits a guardrail and it takes Fred's head 
   clean off his shoulders!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A year passes and Jane is released from the psychiatric hospital she 
   was committed to, put there due to the grief she suffered from losing 
   her son and Fred (but mainly Fred). Leslie divorced Jane during her 
   time in the hospital and received custody of daughter Lucy, but Jane 
   isn't too worried about that. Why? Well, the first thing Jane does 
   when she gets out of the hospital is to go to the mansion and rent 
   the same room she shared with Fred. Robert is still there and he is 
   happy to accommodate Jane, following her previous written 
   instructions to make the apartment look exactly like it was before 
   the car accident, but with one caveat. She asked that a padlock be 
   put on the freezer in the refrigerator and she is to have the only 
   key. Robert was more than happy to oblige, only thinking this will be 
   the time when he can have Jane to himself, but he is in for a rude 
   awakening. When Jane first enters the apartment, a rush of nostalgia 
   rushes over her. She puts a homemade shrine she has created for Fred 
   (with locks of his hair, a champagne cork, his Visa card and even 
   used cigarette butts!) on a dresser facing the bed (so she can look 
   at it when she lays down) and when she sees that her robe falls down 
   by itself off a hook, she thinks Robert is in the room and starts 
   calling out his name. Robert hears Jane moaning and thinks (like we 
   do) that she is masturbating, but as we will discover later in the 
   film, it is something much more disgusting and perverted (it is also 
   strange that Jane doesn't have one photo of her dead son in the 
   entire apartment).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Robert realizes that he needs a shave, shower and a change of 
   clothes, so he cleans himself up, puts on his best suit and cooks 
   dinner (It's not easy for a blind man to do these things, as we see 
   during a brief montage sequence). He then makes the trek upstairs, 
   knocks on Jane's door and invites her to have dinner with him (she 
   answers the door with her nightgown open, exposing her breasts, but 
   she still covers up, knowing full well that Robert is blind), but she 
   says she can't come because she has a previous appointment and asks 
   for a rain check, yet Robert notices that she doesn't leave her 
   apartment the entire night. What is going on?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The next day, Leslie comes to the mansion so that Jane can see Lucy, 
   but when she hugs Mom and won't let go, we can see a look of panic 
   and disgust on Jane's face. It is also obvious that Lucy is a very 
   sick and twisted little girl who has plans for Mom. Long story short, 
   things come to a head (so to speak) when Robert picks the padlock on 
   the freezer and feels something in there that he thought he would 
   never touch. (If anyone has ever rented or purchased Vestron Video's 
   slightly edited version of this film on VHS, titled <B><A HREF="frozen_terror_1980.htm">FROZEN
    TERROR</A></B>, they will know what that object is, as the box art 
   gives the surprise away!). For those of you that don't know what it 
   is or have lived in a cave for all your lives and want to be 
   surprised: Warning: <B>MAJOR SPOILER!!!</B> The object in the freezer 
   is Fred's decapitated head, which Jane pulls out every so often to 
   make sweet love to! <B>END OF SPOILER!!!</B></FONT></FONT><BR>

    Robert is so upset on what he has discovered that he slips a note to 
   Lucy to give to her father, telling him to call Robert immediately. 
   Leslie calls Robert and he tells him what he found, only Leslie 
   doesn't want to hear it, telling Robert he erased Jane from his life 
   since the day he discovered her cheating on him, which he thinks is 
   the cause of his son's death. As a matter of fact, if it weren't for 
   the court appointed visits she has with Lucy, he would rather not see 
   her at all (&quot;As far as I'm concerned, she's dead!&quot;). Leslie 
   ends the phone call by telling Robert to get his head examined 
   because his love for Jane is fucking with his mind. What Leslie and 
   Robert don't realize is that Lucy overheard the entire conversation 
   and it gives her an idea on how to get the ultimate revenge on her mother.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Lucy sneaks into Jane's apartment (after accusing Robert of being in 
   love with her mother and stealing her away from her own daughter), 
   finds the key to the padlock, unlocks the freezer door and sees the 
   object for herself. Later on that day, Lucy tells Robert and Jane 
   that she wants to cook dinner for them, which she does. The first 
   course is vegetable stew, only Robert won't eat it because it smells 
   funny (Fact: Blind people have a keener sense of smell than most 
   seeing people). Jane is happy to dig in, though, but when she takes 
   the first spoonful and puts it in her mouth, she immediately tastes 
   something strange. It's Fred's earring, still attached to his 
   earlobe! Jane gets ill and runs to the bathroom, Lucy following close 
   behind. Lucy tells her mother that she killed her brother (&quot;You 
   don't know how hard it was for me to hold him underwater, with all 
   that kicking!&quot;). Jane goes psycho and kills Lucy by strangling 
   her with her bare hands and then putting her body in the bathtub, 
   which she fills up with water, holding her body underwater until it 
   can't float. Robert goes upstairs to find out what is happening, only 
   to have Jane push him down a flight of stairs, knocking him out. Jane 
   then locks all the doors in the mansion so no one can leave or get 
   in. Jane then pulls the object out of the freezer, puts it on a 
   pillow on her bed and begins to French kiss it! (Raising the hairs on 
   the backs of the necks of everyone watching it) while moaning loudly. 
   Robert wakes up and Jane grabs a knife and tries to kill him, only to 
   have Robert kill her by shoving her face in a working portable 
   electric oven, burning her face beyond recognition. Robert then hears 
   something coming from Jane's bedroom and goes to investigate, <A HREF="macabre_1980_foreign_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/macabre italy poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="307" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>climbing
    on Jane's bed. Suddenly, the object comes flying through the air, 
   biting him on the neck! The nonsense end scrawl says that doctors 
   couldn't find a reason for Robert's death and it remains a mystery up 
   to this day.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Besides the ridiculous ending (which Lamberto Bava says was 
   tacked-on without his permission), this is a fairly engrossing 
   psychological thriller with precious little blood or gore (we don't 
   even see Fred lose his head, just a bloody guardrail on top of the 
   steering wheel). But this film doesn't need it, as the psychological 
   mystery elements sustain the film until the insulting 
   &quot;surprise&quot; finale. The English dubbers also had a field day 
   with their over-exaggerated Southern accents, but Veronica Zinny is 
   absolutely creepy as the evil Lucy, even with her accent. So creepy 
   and evil, you'll want to kill her yourselves, especially when she 
   explains to Jane how she killed her brother. I consider this Lamberto 
   Bava's most polished and professional film. Even though it's his 
   first film as a credited director, I find most of his later films, 
   such as <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Devil Fish">DEVIL FISH</A></B> 
   (1984), <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#YoullDieMidnight86">YOU'LL

   (1985) and its <A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#Demons2-1986">sequel</A> 
   (1986), to be lesser films than this, not because they were gorier, 
   but because the stories seemed incomplete, a case of flash and style 
   over content. As I have stated in several of my other Lamberto Bava 
   reviews, I believe he regressed as a director as his career 
   progressed, for one simple reason, the stories never delivered, in 
   both content and characters. The screenplay for this film, written by 
   Bava, Pupi Avati (director/writer of <B><A HREF="balsamus_man_of_satan_1970.htm">BALSAMUS:
    MAN OF SATAN</A></B> - 1970 and <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#Zeder1983">ZEDER:
    REVENGE OF THE DEAD</A></B> - 1983), his brother Antonio Avati (a 
   co-writer/producer of many of his brother's films) and Roberto Gandus (<B><A HREF="no_way_out_1973.htm">NO
    WAY OUT</A></B> - 1973; <B><A HREF="#Madhouse">MADHOUSE</A></B> - 
   1981), doesn't have that problem, as the main characters are 
   well-written and we get involved in them, except for that insane, 
   unbelievable ending.&nbsp; I know others are going to disagree with 
   me, but I think this is Lamberto Bava's best film, just like <B><A HREF="texas_chainsaw_massacre_1974.htm">THE

   Police Thriller. It starts out well enough, but too many coincidences 
   and gaping plot holes do this film in, even though it has a great 
   cast of pros. Nanni Vitali (Helmut Berger; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#SecretDorianGray70">DORIAN

   prison escape with a getaway driver pulling up to take them away. 
   Just at the same time, Detective Inspector Giulio Santini (Richard

   bloody mess and dead. They dig a grave and cover his body in lime. 
   Vitali not only decides to keep Giuliana as a hostage,<A HREF="mad_dog_1977.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mad dog 1977 vhs front2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   but also as a sexual plaything. Inspector Santini follows the clues 
   and leads him to Giuliana's apartment. She answers the door, but 
   answers his questions nervous enough to make him more than 
   suspicious, so he assigns a cop, Pappalardo (Gigi Bonos; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Frankenstein 80">FRANKENSTEIN
    '80</A></B> - 1973) keep an eye out on her apartment. Vitali was 
   hiding in her apartment and wants her to reconnect with her estranged 
   father, who she hasn't spoken to in over a year. No, he doesn't like 
   family reunions; it's part of a plan to steal millions of dollars at 
   the security firm daddy works at (they hold the pay for several 
   companies) and then leave the country millionaires. He then again 
   rapes Giuliana. After 3 days, Vitali allows Giuliana leave the 
   apartment to go see her father, but she goes sees Inspector Santini 
   instead and spills the beans. Santini tells her to act like 
   everything is normal. The police will be waiting at the security firm 
   when Vitali and his men arrive and they will use counterfeit money, 
   to boot. Vitali and his three escaped inmates go to the security 
   firm, but something goes wrong and Santini takes all the women 
   workers (including Giuliana) hostage and they take off in a van. They 
   run into a police blockade a few miles away, but Vitali uses a car he 
   has stored in the area (as a getaway car) and crashes through the 
   police barrier, getting away. Santini at least now has the three 
   escaped convicts and makes them dig up the stoolie's corpse. Santini 
   also knows Vitali well enough to know he will go after Giuliana, 
   which he tries to do with a high-powered rifle across the street, but 
   all he does is shoot Giuliana in the leg (not seriously) while she is 
   on the phone with Santini. Vitali gets away and Santini makes 
   Giuliana stay at her father's house and they reconnect as a family 
   again (Awwwww). Vitali hits his sister Rosa (Maria Pascucci) up for 
   some money since the robbery money was counterfeit and he then 
   kidnaps a Judge (Claudio Gora; </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="action part 2.htm#MeanFrank1973">MEAN

   - 1973), who sent him to prison, and his daughter Carla (Marina 
   Giordana), who happens to be the father and sister of Santini (How's 
   that for a coincidence, especially since Santini talked to his father 
   on the phone earlier and there was no mention he was a judge? We 
   thought he was a retired policeman.). Vitali calls up Santini and 
   asks for an enormous amount of money for ransom and gives him three 
   days to collect it. Vitale has another buddy just out of prison help 
   him and he shoots and seriously injures the judge. Vitali strips 
   Carla topless and begins cutting her with a strait-razor. Santini 
   shows up and shoots and kills the other man and then begins to beat 
   the snot out of Vitali, saying he's not going to kill him, but make 
   him spend the rest of his useless life in prison. After Santini gives 
   Vitali an appropriate beatdown (complete with slow-motion 2x4 
   breaking), the police take the bloodied Vitali away and it turns out 
   the Judge will live. A happy ending for all!&nbsp; This was the last

   Spaghetti Westerns. This is a pretty boring example of an Italian 
   Police Thriller where most logic is thrown out the window (How many 
   times can Vitali get away? How did Santini find out so quickly where

   bloody beatdowns of the stoolie and Vitali and the razor cutting of

   a genre known for its bad taste. See Umberto Lenzi's <B><A HREF="action.htm#Almost Human">ALMOST

   actors here were speaking English, they were very badly dubbed (by 
   Nick Alexander and Ted Rusoff, no less!) and the dialogue contains 
   such cringe-worthy lines as, &quot;So have a drink twat!&quot; and 
   &quot;One move and I'll cut off her tit!&quot;. This lower-tier

   (made a year earlier). Unfortunately it's deadly dull, the boredom 
   broken up by infrequent bits of gore. Julia (Trish Everly) is rapidly 
   approaching her 25th birthday. Her grotesquely deformed twin sister 
   Mary, riddled with a debilitating disease and mentally unstable, 
   escapes from the hospital and starts killing Julia's friends and

   kills his father in a diner (after arguing about the son's mistress) 
   and the cook kills the son with a shotgun. The wife of the son pays a 
   private dick to get all the info he can on the woman, but that turns 
   out easier said than done because the P.I. can't find any information 
   on her as she doesn't seem to exist. That woman, who now uses the 
   name Laura (Deborah Mansey), has her sights now set on married ad 
   executive Richard Bloch (Eric Kramer), for reasons that, for now, are 
   still unclear. He at first rebuffs Laura's feminine wiles, but a man 
   can only stand so much. He finally succumbs at a party and the affair 
   is on. Meanwhile, Richard's wife Annie (Pascale Devigne) becomes 
   suspicious of Richard's staying out late with lame excuses (and, 
   somehow, is connected to the father/son murder in the beginning) and 
   the P.I. begins to patch together Laura's past and it's not pretty 
   (DO NOT read the back of the video box if you want to stay surprised 
   as it gives away the film's punchline). Since I'm not about to give 
   away Laura's secret, I'll just say it's not Richard that Laura is 
   after and this is all an intricate plot that is all related to 
   Laura's past and the father/son murder in the beginning of the film. 
   And, yes, the word &quot;Madonna&quot; does play an important part in 
   the plot. Director Alain Zaloum (<B><A HREF="suspicious_minds_1997.htm">SUSPICIOUS
    MINDS</A></B> - 1997) purposely builds the film slowly. Besides the 
   first murders in the beginning, no blood is spilled until very nearly 
   the end and when it happens, it hits hard because we have begun to 
   care about the characters. For a change, people in this film actually 
   act like real people, as we see Richard turn from loving family man 
   to cold hearted bastard, thanks to Laura's influence. Don't get me 
   wrong. This film is no great shakes, but it is a pleasant diversion 
   from most of the &quot;erotic thrillers&quot; of this time period and 
   the unusual twist to the basic cheating husband syndrome makes this 
   more engrossing than most. This Canadian-made thriller is good for at 
   least one viewing, but is harder than hell to find. If you get a 
   chance to pick this up, do so. Also starring James Horan, Gordon Day

    (the film's alternate title). This portion has enough red herrings 
   to feed a large Vietnamese family: There's the retarded janitor who 
   likes to take pictures of the girls in the locker room from his 
   closet peephole; the sadistic nurse who is taking care of the 
   stroke-ridden grandmother of one of the majorettes. She is also the 
   janitor's mother; the crazy drug dealer who got one of the murdered 
   majorettes pregnant; the town priest who babtizes his disciples in a 
   lake (the victims are stabbed then placed in water); and the sheriff 
   (don't read the rest if you want to see the film!). When the retarded 
   janitor accidently photographs the sheriff butchering a majorette in 
   the locker room, this film veers off into many tangents. The nurse, 
   armed with the incriminating photos, blackmails the sheriff to do her 
   bidding. She wants him to kill the majorette related to the 
   grandmother in her care after she turns 18 (two weeks away), so 
   grandma will inherit her $500,000.00. She then plans on giving 
   grandma a lethal injection of insulin so she will inherit it (it's in 
   the will). Things go awry when the majorette in question and a 
   boyfriend are kidnapped by the drug dealer and his gang because the 
   boyfriend ratted to the cops about an arguement the dealer had with 
   the dead pregnant majorette. Are you with me so far? The retarded 
   janitor sees the kidnapping taking place and follows them to an 
   abandoned warehouse. He walks in on the attempted&nbsp; rape of the 
   majorette and a struggle ensues. The janitor and the majorette are 
   shot dead. The drug dealing gang flee leaving the boyfriend to vow 
   revenge. He grabs an automatic rifle, goes to the gang's hideout and 
   systematically slaughters them. But, you may ask, &quot;What about 
   the sheriff?&quot; He goes to see the nurse, hangs her, leaves his 
   camouflage clothing in her son's darkroom so it will look like he was 
   the killer, takes the incriminating photos and is last seen watching 
   a group of pre-teen majorettes performing their routines. THE END. 
   The premise may sound interesting but it is hampered by a couple of 
   factors. First, the acting is poor, too substandard to carry off the 
   complex storyline. The second factor is the overall cheesiness of the 
   production. This is a barebones production which never rises above a 
   Grade Z level, with its' static camerawork, poor sound quality and 
   lackluster direction. One expects more from screenwriter/producer

   intentions of surviving a nuclear explosion with their families

   [1993 - 2002]) begins wearing Army fatigues and starts barking orders 
   to everyone else. Some townspeople, including rednecks Virgil (Johnny 
   Weissmuller Jr.) and Ernie (Bob Goldthwait), try to steal gas from 
   the ranch (gas stations start charging $20 a gallon, which is not 
   unthinkable in today's economy and may become true earlier than you 
   may think), but are chased off by Lee's gunfire. When Kirk Fredericks 
   (Tom Bower, a terrific character actor [you may know him better as 
   the gas station attendant in the 2006 <B><A HREF="hills_have_eyes_2006.htm">THE

   shoots family friend Suzie Barker (Mimi Farina) by mistake, Lee 
   refuses to help her (&quot;If I help her, more will come!&quot;), but 
   Kirk's wife Lois (Marilyn Hassett) is a nurse and removes the bullet. 
   Virgil and Ernie return in a cropdusting plane and taint the ranch's 
   water reservoir with poison. Virgil and Ernie then intercept Eric's 
   van and take the kids hostage. Lee loses what little mind he has left 
   (he punches son Eric in the face for getting caught!) and starts 
   talking about &quot;acceptable losses&quot; among the children during 
   a planned rescue attempt. When Harry (Michael Pritchard) hears on the 
   radio that the U.S. and Russia have agreed to a cease fire, he goes 
   to tell everyone at the hostage standoff, but is shot by Virgil. To 
   make a long story short, Lee goes crazy, shoots Kirk in the leg and 
   the children get in between their parents and the hostage takers and 
   join hands. Leave it to the children to be the voice of reason. 
   Clean-up on aisle six! I just threw up!&nbsp; The main problem with 
   this boring thriller is the families are so unlikable (including the 
   kids), you'll be wishing for their demise to be long and painful. 
   Their constant bickering and back-stabbing is so annoying, you'll 
   wonder how the hell they became friends in the first place. Not much 
   happens during the entire film, as one-time director/producer Thomas 
   A. Cohen has no idea how to end a scene. Many of them just fade to 
   black and the next scene begins, which screams of inexperience or 
   downright laziness. The action scenes are equally horrendous and 
   badly staged. There's a terrible car chase through a minefield where, 
   when the mine explode, they look about as dangerous as a toothless 
   dog. The cheap dimestore moralizing is laughable and the breaking 
   point comes in the unrealistic plan the families come up with to 
   rescue their children. The whole film stinks of Christian religious 
   philosophies, from the opening and closing gospel tune, making the 
   medical doctor the bad guy (better to leave your fate to God, than in 
   the hands of man) and the &quot;A child shall lead them&quot; corny 
   finale. I've seen better morals in fortune cookies. The violence is 
   non-existant (just a couple of bullet wounds) and the acting is way 
   below par (Try not to laugh as comedian Bob(cat) Goldthwait, in his 
   first acting role, says after being shot, &quot;Virgil, I'm bleeding 
   pretty badly!&quot;). The soap opera dialogue (by scripters Larry 
   Wittnebert and Richard Beban) and bleak outlook of the human 
   condition (it basically says that everyone is better off dead should 
   the bombs be dropped) could only appeal to religious zealots and 
   those without a clue. If you don't fall into those two categories, 
   just stay away and save yourself an agonizing 90 minutes. Should have

   your death. One of his favorite pasttimes is watching &quot;Mikey's

    Florence was in the grip of a serial killer from August 21, 1968 to 
   September 8, 1985, where the &quot;Monster of Venice&quot; killed 
   sixteen people in a series of brutal double murders, gunning 
   lovebirds down <A HREF="monster_of_florence_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/monster of florence italy book cover small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>(usually
    in their cars) and doing the unthinkable to his women victims. He 
   held the province of Florence, Italy in a state of panic and fear for 
   nearly 17 years and was never caught (much like our &quot;Zodiac 
   Killer&quot;). There have been many theories on who the Monster of 
   Florence (also referred to as &quot;The Surgeon of Death&quot;) 
   really was, but it was never proven to a definitive degree.&nbsp; 
   Some people believe he was arrested for another crime and was in 
   jail, some believe he died (There was a lot of talk that a man named 
   Mario Nancini, who died in 1986, was the killer, but it was never 
   proven to be true, even though a lot of Italy law enforcement 
   officials, up to this day, believe it to be true) and some believe 
   that he just stopped killing (highly unlikely), but no matter the 
   reason, he had an adverse effect on Florence's residents and those 
   that lived there during his reign of terror will never forget him. 
   This film is based on the best selling book &quot;Il Mostro De 
   Firenze&quot;, written by former District Attorney Alberto Bevilacque 
   and crime reporter Mario Spezi (Bevilacque refused to allow his name 
   to be used on this film, so only Spezi is given a story credit). So 
   is this film any good? Read on to discover my answer.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">September 8, 1985:</FONT></B> A young couple 
   are making love in a tent in the woods when a man in black boots 
   walks up to the tens, cuts a hole in it with a large knife and 
   empties his pistol (a .22 caliber Beretta, his weapon of choice) into 
   the young couple's naked bodies. The naked man, who was hit five 
   times, manages to run out of the tent, but the killer catches him, 
   stabbing him with his large knife. The killer then drags his body 
   back to the tent, where he does something to the female's body (read 
   on), washes his bloody hands in a nearby creek and then leaves. The 
   next morning, the police and a large group of press are at the crime 
   scene. This is a crime scene both the police and the press have been 
   at more times then they care to remember and tempers flare when the 
   police catch some photographers taking photos of the victims' 
   mutilated bodies. What none of them know is that this will be the 
   Monster of Florence's last victims and the police are no closer now 
   in figuring out who the killer is than when he first struck in 1968. 
   Newspaper reporter Giulia (Bettina Giovannini; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#VoicesFromBeyond91">VOICES
    FROM BEYOND</A></B> - 1991), who has been reporting on this case for 
   the past four years, is working with veteran reporter Enrico 
   (Gabriele Tinti; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#MurderSecret1988">THE 
   MURDER SECRET</A></B> - 1989), is letting the killings affect her 
   emotionally, something a reporter should never let happen. What is 
   particularly disturbing is what the serial killer is doing to his 
   female victims: He cuts out their vaginas and removes one of their 
   breasts. The Police Commissioner (Gianfranco Baroni) wants to know 
   why, but only the killer can answer that question. He also wants to 
   know why the killer only kills one couple every couple of years, 
   during the summer and only on a moonless night (all real facts of the 
   case). Giulia's fianc&eacute;, Andreas Ackerman (Leonard Mann; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CutAndRun1985">CUT
    AND RUN</A></B> - 1985) is a novelist who has been working on a book 
   about the killings for several years and Giulia has noticed that what 
   he has already written is eerily coming true. She has also noticed 
   that Andreas has been acting strange lately, distant and non-verbal 
   and he disappears for days. I know what you are thinking, but Andreas 
   tells Giulia that he is beginning to doubt that anyone would be 
   interested in his book and he is thinking about a career change. Is 
   he telling the truth?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Andreas visits the recent crime scene, where he meets the mother 
   (Anna Orso; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Exterminators 3000">EXTERMINATORS
    OF THE YEAR 3000</A></B> - 1983) of a previous Monster of Florence 
   victim, telling him about her daughter, what she was wearing and how 
   she was about to marry to young man that was murdered beside her. The 
   mother tells Andreas that she thinks that the killer will never be 
   caught and the only emotion she has left is hate. This is how Andreas 
   is able to get facts for his book, by talking to family members of 
   past victims. They tell him much more than they would tell the 
   police. Andreas goes home and begins banging away at his typewriter, 
   while thinking about the information he got about the first murders 
   on <B><FONT COLOR="NAVY">August 21, 1968</FONT></B>, where the 
   Monster of Florence walked up to a car where a young couple were 
   making love, emptying his Beretta into their bodies (It looks 
   strangely identical to the &quot;Son of Sam&quot; murders that 
   gripped New York City in the summers of 1976 &amp; 1977). Andreas 
   believes the answer to the question of why the serial killer kills 
   can be found in the first murders (and he is probably correct, 
   because a killer's motive can usually be found in his first killing). 
   We discover that the woman killed in the car back in 1968 was 
   cheating on her husband. In fact she had many lovers. But how will 
   this lead Andreas to the killer's identity?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then travel back to Florence in 1968 (The Warsaw Pact invasion of 
   Czechoslovakia [a.k.a. &quot;Operation Danube&quot;] is playing on 
   the TV), where we see the nameless woman days before her murder (none 
   of the victims are given proper names, to protect the filmmakers from 
   lawsuits). She is a prostitute, who supports her deadbeat husband and 
   young son by doing the horizontal tango with &quot;clients&quot; out 
   of her own home, with her husband in the next room (he even interrupt 
   his wife and lover to give them coffee!). The next morning, an 
   unknown man (we only see from his POV) confront the woman outside her 
   home, telling her he needs to see her. She tells him to make an 
   appointment like everyone else and drives off with a client in his 
   car (the same client and car the woman was killed in). Andreas comes 
   to the conclusion that the killer is a spurned lover or suitor, but 
   is he right? Back in 1968, the killer phones the woman's husband, 
   telling him that he slipped a note under his front door. The husband 
   read the note and burns it, as we will never know what was written in 
   it. Is this all in Andreas' mind or does he know more than he is 
   telling? You<A HREF="night_ripper_italy_1985.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/night ripper german dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="217" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   will be asking yourself those questions several times in this film, 
   but you may not like the answer, because they are nothing but 
   conjecture, because the killer was never caught, but don't let that 
   detract you from this film, because it is quite good.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Directed and co-written by Cesare Ferrario, who didn't make anything 
   of note that would tickle the fancy of a genre film lover, yet this 
   movie is a suspenseful foray into the mind of a serial killer. I like 
   to consider this film as Italy's equivalent to <B><A HREF="silence_of_the_lambs_1991.htm">SILENCE
    OF THE LAMBS</A></B> (1991) or even <A HREF="henry_portrait_of_a_serial_killer.htm"><B>HENRY:
    PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER</B></A> (1986), but without the graphic 
   gore. Leonard Mann is simply wonderful as Andreas and we are with him 
   as he tries to solve the killings based solely on the evidence he 
   collected from the victims' families and his sharp, deductive mind. 
   Soon, Andreas is obsessed and possessed by this case, as everything 
   he sees reminds him of the murders (even when he and Giulia go to the 
   opera) and in one instance in the film, he accidentally meets the 
   serial killer, but he doesn't know it. Yes, this is a fictional 
   account of a real-life serial killer, but there is a lot of truth to 
   it, making this film a good bet for giallo and thriller fans alike. 
   It's not exploitative (there is nudity and blood, however), even if 
   it does play fast and loose with some of the facts (which is why none 
   of the victims are given proper names), but that does not mean you 
   will not find much to like here. The film works due to Leonard Mann, 
   who as writer Andreas has an &quot;Aha!&quot; moment and runs with 
   it, ignoring everything around him, even Giulia. While the murders 
   aren't particularly bloody (except for the opening double killing), 
   just knowing what the Monster of Florence does to his female victims 
   adds an extra layer of nastiness to the killings, which are shown 
   matter-of-factly, making them hard to watch. Since we know how the 
   film ends, it doesn't negate the fact that this is a good film, full 
   of great performances and shot almost documentary style. The film is 
   shown in chapters, the first chapter dealing with the victims' point 
   of view and the second chapter illustrating the killer's side, yet 
   still breaking the film down year-by-year according to the killer's 
   murders. It is an interesting premise, showing us both sides of the 
   killings, giving the murders some added emotional power. The killings 
   are filmed with two cameras (one for the victims' view and the other 
   the killer's), giving us different angles of the same killings, yet 
   they seem very different (And they are. There is a big difference 
   being the killer and being his victim). So sit down, try to relax (it 
   won't be easy) and watch a film that deserves to be more popular than 
   it is.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   This mid-'60s film can be considered one of the blueprints for giallo 
   films to come, as it contains all the genre's staples, including an 
   unknown killer dressed in black, a location that is out of the way 
   and inescapable, a weapon used in many of these films and a cast of 
   red herrings. What it is missing are some of the more prevalent 
   ingredients that we expect from giallo films, namely nudity and

    Morley 1870: Someone wearing a black hooded robe, black leather 
   gloves and carrying a straight razor is carving up the patients and 
   staff of the Vance Rest Home, a psychiatric clinic for &quot;nervous 
   (i.e. loony) people that is located deep in the woods. The clinic is 
   run by the extremely tough Dr. Robert Vance (William Berger; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#Keoma1976">KEOMA</A></B> 
   - 1976) and the even tougher head nurse, Sheena (Harriet Medin White; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BlackSabbath1963">BLACK
    SABBATH</A></B> - 1963). A new nurse, Mary (Barbara Wilson, in her 
   only film), is starting today, due to the last nurse 
   &quot;disappearing&quot; (i.e. murdered) in the middle of the night. 
   Sheena takes Mary on her rounds and introduces her to the home's 
   patients, including the mute Janey (Anna Marie Polani, as &quot;Ann 
   Sherman&quot;; <B><A HREF="hercules_against_the_moon_men_1964.htm">HERCULES
    AGAINST THE MOON MEN</A></B> - 1964) and the manic Fred (Massimo 
   Righi, as &quot;Max Dean&quot;; <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#BloodBlackLace1964">BLOOD
    AND BLACK LACE</A></B> - 1964), who can become extremely violent at 
   the drop of a hat. Also at the clinic, but not patients, are Dr. 
   Vance's wife, Lizabeth (Mary Young; <B><A HREF="secret_agent_777_1965.htm">SECRET
    AGENT 777</A></B> - 1965), who has a heart condition, another nurse

    IN THE LAND OF THE CYCLOPS</A></B> - 1961), who is the rest home's 
   muscle, subduing patients who get violent or try to escape. Rounding 
   out this cast of characters is butler/groundskeeper Walter (William 
   Gold), a hulking bald man who unfortunately gets on Dr. Vance's nerves.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Sheena introduces Mary to Fred, he is calm and polite, but some 
   loud shuffling of feet on the upstairs floor directly above Fred's 
   room turns him violent and he tries to attack Mary, forcing Ivan to 
   restrain Fred to his bed while Dr. Vance injects him with a sedative. 
   The loud noise on the floor above is not easily ignored (it would 
   drive anyone insane), so when Dr. Vance excuses himself and heads 
   upstairs, Mary decides to follow him, only to be stopped by Walter, 
   who tells her that no one except for Dr. Vance is allowed upstairs 
   and that includes the staff. We discover that there is a hideously 
   scarred woman named Laura (Delfi Mauro, as &quot;Delphine 
   Maurin&quot;; <B><A HREF="danger_death_ray_1967.htm">DANGER! DEATH RAY</A></B> 
   - 1967) who lives upstairs (She has a club foot and wears the same 
   black robe and gloves as the killer, but as we all know by watching 
   giallo films, a reveal such as this so early in the film usually 
   means she is nothing but a red herring). We can tell Dr. Vance cares 
   deeply about her, but Laura refuses to show him her face (There's a 
   good reason for that, she's fucking butt-ugly!). We have no idea why 
   Dr. Vance cares so deeply for her (at least not yet), but what we do 
   know is Dr. Vance and Sheena (who assists him) are working on a 
   regeneration formula that will make scarred skin look normal again, 
   but time after time the formula fails (he tests it on guinea pigs, 
   which he slices open with a scalpel, applying the formula on the 
   incision), yet he hopes his latest tweaks to the formula is a success.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The killer then tries to slice Janey in her bed, but since she is 
   mute she cannot scream, so she jumps out her bedroom window and tries 
   to escape the killer on the home's grounds (I'm not 100% sure, but it 
   looks like the same location as that used in <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#PatrickStillLives80">PATRICK
    STILL LIVES</A></B> - 1980), but the killer grabs her and slices her 
   throat with the straight razor, killing her. The next morning, Mary 
   goes to check up on Janey (they have become fond of each other), only 
   to have Dr. Vance tell her that Janey's relatives took her away last 
   night because they didn't believe she belonged in such a place. Mary 
   finds that explanation hard to believe, but Sheena backs up Dr. 
   Vance's story and tells Mary to get back to work, she has other 
   patients to take care of. I'm pretty sure neither Dr. Vance or Sheena 
   are the killer, but why would they both lie to Mary? Do they know who 
   the killer is?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We are then in a horse-drawn carriage, occupied by two people, 
   Gisele de Bramtone (Francoise Prevost; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Possessor1975">THE
    POSSESSOR</A></B> - 1975) and her husband Marc (Philippe Hersent; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#SilverSaddle1978">SILVER
    SADDLE</A></B> - 1978). It is obvious that their marriage is 
   troubled since all they do is argue with each other. Marc tells 
   Gisele that he is taking her someplace where she can straighten out 
   her life (She's a serial cheater and crook, a bitch with a capital 
   &quot;C&quot;). She begs Marc to stop at the nearest town because she 
   has been in the carriage for far too long, she needs a bath and a 
   soft hotel bed to sleep in. Marc refuses (he knows she is up to 
   something), but when the carriage breaks down, Gisele pummels Marc 
   over the head with an iron bar, killing him. She then wanders in the 
   woods and secretly spots Dr. Vance burying Janey's body. Not one to 
   look a gift horse in the mouth, Gisele pretends to pass out and when 
   Dr. Vance finds her, he takes her to his rest home to recuperate. She 
   insinuates herself into Dr. Vance's life, which pisses off Lizabeth, 
   especially when her husband tells her to give Gisele some of her 
   clothes, telling her all they are doing is taking up space in her 
   closet! Soon, Gisele shows her true colors, telling Dr. Vance that 
   she saw him burying the body in the woods, blackmailing him for a 
   large sum of cash, unless he wants her to show the police where the 
   body is buried. Dr. Vance agrees to the cash payout, telling her he 
   will need some time to get that much cash together. He really doesn't 
   have to worry, though, because the killer enters Gisele's bedroom 
   that night and kills her by slicing her throat.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Dr. Vance blames Fred for Gisele's murder, since later that same 
   night he tried to kill Mary in her bedroom, but Ivan stopped him 
   before he could finish the deed. Dr. Vance has Ivan put Fred in a 
   dungeon cell (every mental institution has one!) and tells everyone 
   the killer has been apprehended. But is Fred the robed killer (he 
   wasn't wearing one when he attacked Mary)? Don't count on it! We then 
   discover that Laura is Lizabeth's sister, as a prolonged flashback 
   shows us how she became horribly scarred. Back then, Dr. Vance was a 
   prominent (and rich) surgeon who just got married to Lizabeth. Laura 
   then pays them a visit and Dr. Vance becomes infatuated with her, 
   spending more time with Laura than his new wife, but Lizabeth seems 
   happy that her sister and husband are enjoying themselves and 
   laughing all the time. Dr. Vance was also building his dream clinic 
   and takes Lizabeth and Laura to the site to see how construction is 
   progressing. While standing on a wooden platform above the 
   construction, the rope protecting Laura from falling gives way and 
   she falls into a vat of lye, scarring her entire body. Even though 
   Dr. Vance was cleared of any wrongdoing, he was blackballed by his 
   peers, who accused him of pushing Laura into the lye. Unable to find 
   a job as a surgeon, Dr. Vance loses his prominence and goes broke, 
   forcing him to take the job at this out-of-the-way rest home, far 
   away from anyone who knows who he actually is. The flashback then ends.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The real killer is obvious to anyone with half a brain, as the robed 
   murderer tries to kill Mary, but Laura stops it from happening, 
   saving Mary. The killer has murdered both Fred and Katty, so it is 
   not too much of a reach to reveal that the killer is Lizabeth. She 
   was the one who loosened the rope, causing her sister to become 
   horribly scarred. Sheena then discovers that Dr. Vance's formula 
   actually works, but is it too late for it to do any good? I'll let 
   you discover that for yourself.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   can't understand why. A quartet of leather-wearing, whip-wielding 
   hooligans, who ride around in a dune buggy while sporting red 
   motorcycle helmets, roam the countryside breaking into houses, raping

   caregiver (in other words, a nurse), disposing of the body of her

   boyfriend, Victor (Jean Sorel; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#ShortNightDolls1971">SHORT
    NIGHT OF GLASS DOLLS</A></B> - 1971), who has no idea of Ana's 
   murderous behavior, is running secret experiments in a government 
   laboratory where he tries to excise criminal and violent behavior 
   from the human brain using a complex method of hypnosis and 
   electroshock therapy. The police ask Victor to look into a string of 
   violent murders of young men, stabbed in the heart with a scalpel, 
   since they believe the killer is a homosexual psychopath with medical 
   experience. Victor begins his investigation, not aware that the 
   killer is actually Ana, who likes to listen to her victims' 
   heartbeats (by putting her ear to their bare chests) before plunging 
   in the scalpel. We watch Ana take on various disguises (old woman, 
   maid, rich heiress) as she picks out her victims (she even dresses as 
   a man and picks up a young guy at a gay bar!), bringing them back to 
   her home for the kill, but this time she's unaware that David is 
   hiding in her house, watching her latest kill. David eventually lets 
   Ana know his intentions, blackmailing her for huge sums of money to 
   keep him quiet, but David doesn't realize that he's being followed by 
   Mick and the gang. They beat the shit out of David and he is brought 
   to, you guessed it, the hospital that Ana works at. She begins to 
   worry when Victor informs her that David is to be moved to Victor's 
   lab for &quot;rehabilitation&quot; once his wounds are healed. This 
   is not going to turn out well. Not well at all. This strange, 
   off-the-wall thriller, from director Eloy de la Iglesia (<B><A HREF="#Apartment13thFl72">CANNIBAL

    CLOCKWORK ORANGE</A></B> (the film is also name-checked, just before 
   the rape happens and all that's missing is Malcolm McDowall singing 
   Gene Kelly's &quot;Singing In The Rain&quot;) and the future's 
   unhealthy habit of watching too much TV. The TV sections are a 
   precursor to the scenes we would later see in <B><A HREF="robocop_1987.htm">ROBOCOP</A></B> 
   (1987), as we watch TV commercials for products like Blue Drink 
   (&quot;for a blue world&quot;) and Panther Underwear. Once we realize 
   just exactly what Ana is (I had a good laugh when one of her victims 
   was the actor who was selling Panther Underwear on TV), the film 
   settles in and becomes more of a standard futuristic thriller, but 
   with some strange quirks, visuals and music choices that make it 
   stand out from the pack. The future depicted here can best be 
   described as round and lacking sharp corners. Everything is circular 
   in shape (the furniture, objects d'art and even the giant TV screens) 
   with nothing remotely pointy in sight (besides medical instruments) 
   and the main form of entertainment for future society seems to be TV. 
   Lots and lots of TV. The screenplay, by de la Iglesia and four other 
   scripters, implies that violence is needed if society is to survive. 
   When Victor shows Ana three of his &quot;successes&quot; (victims of 
   his experimental procedure), she is shocked, because all she sees are 
   three soulless beings sitting around a dinner table, prattling on 
   about nothing while acting like proper uppercrust members of society. 
   Her &quot;rescue&quot; of David from his hospital bed, where she 
   tells him, &quot;They'll kill you with life. False life!&quot; before 
   killing him with a scalpel to the heart is a revealing moment, 
   especially with the ironic and disturbing final shots that proceed it 
   (I won't spoil it for you). This is an unusual, little-seen gem just 
   waiting to be rediscovered. A young Chris Mitchum (who is poorly

   killing the dancers at the Arts For Living Center in New York City. 
   The first one killed is Susan (Angela Lemerman). She is chloroformed 
   while taking a shower and then has a huge hatpin shoved through her 
   left breast, puncturing her heart. Since Susan was a member of a

   some unknown person and she has nightmares about the mysterious

   giant hatpin, even though she has never met him and doesn't know his 
   name. She begins an investigation of her own when she spots George's 
   face on a billboard. Why does someone she has never met keep haunting 
   her dreams? <A HREF="murder_rock_1984c.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/murder rock dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="247" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>The
    next to die is Janice (Carla Buzzanca), who finds her pet canary 
   impaled on a hatpin before the killer does the same to her. 
   Lieutenant Borges has a large pool of suspects to choose from: Dick 
   Gibson (Claudio Cassinelli), the Center's administrator, who has had 
   an affair with both Susan and Janice; Willy Stark (Cristian 
   Borromeo), Susan's lover and dance partner; Marge (Geretta Marie 
   Fields), Candace's assistant choreographer who thinks Candace is 
   working her dancers too hard; not to mention all the female dancers, 
   who stand to gain a lucrative new job as the other dancers die. 
   Candace makes contact with George Webb, who turns out to be an 
   ex-model who is now an alcoholic. Candace cleans him up and they 
   become lovers, but it's apparent that George is not telling her all 
   about his past. When dancer Jill (Maria Vittoria Tolazzi) becomes the 
   latest victim of the hatpin killer, Lieutenant Borges catches a break 
   when Jill's wheelchair-bound sister takes a photo of the 
   killing-in-process (It turns out to be a faceless photo of the killer 
   in an Armani jacket holding the hatpin, but it does hold an important 
   clue). The finale finds that Candace and George did meet once before 
   (but only for a split second), which has permanently scarred her 
   fragile psyche. His billboard photo triggered her thirst for revenge. 
   Will she get away with it?&nbsp; A lot of people tend to pass this 
   film off as one of director Lucio Fulci's minor 80's films, but I 
   disagree. I find this to be one of his most enjoyable, if 
   far-fetched, 80's films, even though it's severely lacking in the 
   gore department. Those looking for blood-and-guts in the same vein as

    YORK RIPPER</A></B> (1982) will be greatly disappointed, because 
   this is more like a 70's giallo film. There's some blood, but the 
   story (script by Fulci, Vincenzo Mannino, Gianfranco Clerici and 
   Roberto Gianviti) is more interested in the mystery elements and this 
   film has more red herrings than a fish market. Fulci manages to 
   actually pull off a fair amount of suspense and atmosphere (Candace's 
   nightmare being a standout). He also puts in his trademark &quot;What 
   The Fuck?&quot; sequences, including a scene where Lieutenant Borges 
   slaps the shit out of a false confessor when he calls the dead 
   Janice&nbsp; (who was Puerto Rican) a &quot;spic&quot;. Apparently, 
   the Lieutenant doesn't like racist remarks! Fulci also fills the film 
   with plenty of nudity and lots of crotch and ass shots of the females 
   dancing in their leotards to music supplied by Keith Emerson (who 
   also scored <B><A HREF="nighthawks_1981.htm">NIGHTHAWKS</A></B> -

   Army veteran and former P.O.W. Gene Kline (Greg Mullavey) has 
   recurring nightmares about the atrocities he was forced to view while 
   a soldier in the Vietnam War. He comes to the conclusion that the 
   only way to set things right is to kill all those responsible for the 
   atrocities he witnessed and was forced to participate in. He sends 
   all his former Army buddies letters telling them he is coming for a 
   visit and then kills them in ways that are fitting to their war 
   crimes. The first man he visits, he ties to a bed, inserts a needle 
   and tube in his arm and slowly bleeds him to death. He then travels 
   to Texas, to the home of Gil Perkins (Clayton Wilcox) and his wife 
   Susan (Carolyn Ames). Gil and Gene go hunting, get drunk and talk 
   about the &quot;good times&quot; in Vietnam. That night, Gene goes to 
   the Perkins' bedroom, makes Susan tie-up Gil (after he pumps a couple 
   of bullets into his hand and leg) and then rapes Susan (&quot;Shut 
   up, you slant-eyed bitch!&quot;), making Gil watch (Gil screams, 
   &quot;She wasn't even there!&quot;). Gene then kills them both

Gene's wife, Laura (Meredith MacR<A HREF="my_friends_need_killing_1976.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/my friends need killing vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="172" HEIGHT="228" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>ae),
    becomes worried when Gene doesn't come home, so she calls his 
   psychiatrist, Dr. MacLaine (Eric Morris), for some help. Laura finds 
   an address book with the names of Gene's Army buddies and gives it to 
   the doctor. Meanwhile, Gene travels to San Francisco to visit Army 
   pal Les Drago (Roger Cruz), who is now a stage actor. After some 
   sightseeing, Les takes Gene to the theater, where Gene forces Les to 
   perform Shakespeare and them makes him swallow an overdose of pills 
   while reminding him of the children they killed in Vietnam. After 
   calling his wife and saying his goodbyes, Gene travels back home to 
   Los Angeles to visit Walter Miller (Bill Michael), a fellow P.O.W.. 
   After watching Walter parachute out of a plane, Gene stabs him 
   numerous times with a bayonette in a field after talking about their 
   time in the war camp. Laura and Dr. MacLaine drive to Walter's house 
   after talking to Walter's wife, Georgia (Laurie Burton), on the 
   phone. In a scene sure to raise goosebumps, Gene confronts the 
   pregnant Georgia in her bedroom, knife in hand, just as she goes into 
   labor. Rather than kill her, Gene delivers the baby. When Laura and 
   Dr. MacLaine arrive at the Miller's home, they find Georgia and the 
   baby safe in the bedroom. Laura finds Gene dead in the backyard, 
   swinging from a tree, a rope around his neck. His nightmare is now

   DISMEMBER MAMA</A></B> - 1974; <B><A HREF="baby_doll_murders_1993.htm">THE
    BABY DOLL MURDERS</A></B> - 1993), benefits greatly by Greg 
   Mullavey's tortured performance as a man without hope. Mullavey, a 
   regular in many of Leder's films, is a top-notch actor who was 
   woefully underutilized in films, but he gained a modicum of 
   recognition starring as Louise Lasser's husband on TV's <B><A HREF="mary_hartman_mary_hartman_tv_series.htm">MARY
    HARTMAN, MARY HARTMAN</A></B> during 1976 to 1978. This film is 
   Mullavey's show all the way, as he quietly travels from town to town, 
   leaving bodies in his wake, letting the punishment fit the crime. 
   Leder films most of the scenes statically, mainly in medium or 
   extreme close-ups, all the time letting the camera linger on 
   Mullavey's agonizing, tortured face. Leder was never a great 
   filmmaker (his daughter, director Mimi Leder [<B><A HREF="deep_impact_1998.htm">DEEP

   mistakenly thinks is Lucille. Police Inspector Durant (Michael 
   Rennie) is called in to investigate Cynthia's death and Betty Ann's 
   disappearance and the killer murders La Floret to keep him from 
   talking to the police. Can Lucille convince Inspector Durant and 
   Richard that she is telling the truth? The killer has a few more 
   people to dispose of before the motive becomes clear (the first 
   murder of the woman in the bathtub plays an important part in solving 
   the mystery).&nbsp; This Giallo may seem tame today, but for 1968 it 
   was quite daring, with it's scenes of nudity mixed with murder.

    by overdosing on sleeping pills, but Robert stops her. Another 
   suicide attempt by slitting her wrists with a razor lands Claire in a 
   sanitarium, where she and Robert separate for a while. They reconcile 
   by taking a car trip to Claire's dead aunt's country home, but they 
   nearly don't make it there when the extremely foggy road nearly 
   causes a head-on collision with another car. Once at the country 
   home, Robert makes crass jokes about suicide while Claire can only 
   think about the day they lost David and her stay at the sanitarium. 
   Both are dealing with the loss of their son in their own way, but 
   neither are doing a good job at it (She accuses Robert of having a 
   lover while she was committed and Robert just wants to get her drunk 
   and make love, which is what led to this whole disaster in the first 
   place). The country home has no electricity or heat, so they must 
   rely on oil lanterns and the fireplace (when they try to light 
   candles on a candelabra, a strange breeze blows them out), but the 
   lack of basic modern necessities leads to further problems, like 
   Claire hearing the voices of children and telling Robert that there 
   is something wrong with the house and they should leave. It's clear 
   to the viewer that Robert and Claire should no longer be together 
   because the harder they try, the worse it gets. When the truth comes 
   out that Claire's family is rich and Robert may have married her only 
   for her money, which he still hasn't seen a penny of thanks to 
   Claire's nasty mother, the question becomes: Did Robert bring her to 
   the house to kill her (the thought of it excites Claire, who accepts 
   death more than life) or to drive her crazy? Is Claire actually 
   seeing the ghostly visages of children Jessica (Eva Griffith), John 
   (Russell Lewis) and their mother (Lynn Farleigh) or is this part of 
   Robert's plan? Claire believes she is psychic and tells Robert that 
   when David first died, she went to a medium (Peggy Ann Clifford), 
   heard David's voice and is convinced that David is still alive. When 
   Robert also begins to see and hear the ghosts (after he and Claire 
   make love for the first time since David died), it sets the stage for 
   the film's eerie final reveal and seals the fate of our two main 
   characters.&nbsp; While nothing more than a two character filmed 
   stage play, director Kevin Billington (<B><A HREF="light_at_the_edge_of_the_world_1971.htm">THE
    LIGHT AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD</A></B> - 1971) and screenwriters 
   George Kirgo &amp; Robert Enders (also the Producer) had the good 
   sense to have accomplished actors David Hemmings and Gayle Hunnicutt 
   (who also appeared together in <B><A HREF="#FragmentOfFear1970">FRAGMENT
    OF FEAR</A></B> [1970] and were actually married to each other at 
   the time, divorcing in 1975) speak the words and make the most of the 
   limited locations (80% of the film takes place in the main room at 
   the country estate). Billington also makes the wise choice to show 
   Claire's thoughts and flashbacks as a series of tightly edited shock 
   cuts, which are effective and unnerving. While <B>NIGHTMARE</B> (also 
   known as <B><A HREF="voices_1973.htm">VOICES</A></B>) is nothing more 
   than two great actors insulting each other for ninety minutes, it

   brutally gunned-down as they step out of their VW Beetle, doused with 
   gasoline and set on fire. Then the real film kicks in. Too bad. In a 
   small town that survives on it's orange orchards, a group of migrant 
   workers, mainly hippie types, have been toiling in the orchards for 
   months and wish to vote in the town's upcoming elections, but can't

   out to be Jonas Smith (director/screenwriter Sean McGregor), an 
   ex-townie who returns to his hometown riding on a motorcycle and 
   signs over his late father's farm to the migrant workers, giving them 
   a permanent address and, therefore, a right to vote in the upcoming 
   elections. This doesn't sit too well with the local political

    with County Clerk Eva Michaels (Gayle Hemingway), who happens to be 
   the Sheriff's daughter and a romantic interest for Harlan (Chase 
   Cordell), the Sheriff's deputy. At least Harlan thinks he's the 
   romantic interest, but Eva only has eyes for Jonas. As election night 
   draws nearer, things in town get downright dangerous, especially when 
   the migrant workers register to vote. When Jonas discovers that one 
   of the workers, a hulking dude named Cowboy, killed the two hippies 
   in the beginning of the film because they were going to tell Jonas 
   that he was using heroin, Jonas kicks him out of the group, with 
   Cowboy vowing revenge. Election night comes and all of the cronies 
   are voted out of their offices, replaced by &quot;long haired 
   hippies&quot;, so the cronies devise a plan to drive the hippies out 
   of town before they come into power. The Sheriff and Harlan begin 
   arresting the workers on trumped-up charges and offer them all a 
   deal: Do hard county time or get the hell out of town. Things 
   backfire for the cronies when TV reporters and camera arrive in town 
   and an outpouring of positive public opinion for the hippies turn 
   things around, but just like JFK, his brother Robert or Martin Luther 
   King, all good causes come with a deadly price to be paid.&nbsp; This 
   terribly dated film, made in 1971 but not released until 1975, is 
   full of &quot;Us vs. the Establishment&quot; dialogue and scenes of 
   hippie abuse (always a good thing in my book), but the violence level 
   is much too tame for it's own good. The biggest problem in 
   director/scripter Sean McGregor's&nbsp; (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#GentleSavage1973">GENTLE

   (1971) rip-off is that he decided to cast himself in the lead role of 
   Jonas. He's simply terrible in the role, as he couldn't act his way 
   out of a paper bag and whenever he opens his mouth, his pronounced 
   lisp makes it very hard for the viewer to understand a single word he 
   is saying. After a promising violent opening, the film quickly 
   deteriorates into a young against the old scenario and, besides a 
   couple of fistfights and an instance where a pressure hose is turned 
   on a bunch of hippies in a jail cell, nothing much happens until the 
   finale, where Cowboy, strung-out on junk, invades Eva's home, smashes 
   her face into a mirror and then rapes and kills her (off-screen). The 
   Sheriff then gets into a knock-down, drag-out fight with Cowboy (I've 
   never seen more breakaway furniture in one room since a Wild West 
   barroom fight), killing him, grabs his daughter's dead body and 
   carries her to a televised press conference, where he shoots Jonas 
   two times in the chest on live TV in the downbeat finale. Toss in a 
   music soundtrack filled with sappy hippie ballads with titles like 
   &quot; Grass Of Solution&quot;, &quot;Gods And Raging Winds&quot; and 
   the titular &quot;<A HREF="november_children_1971.htm">November Children</A>&quot;
    (the film's early release title), and what you end up with is a film

   disappearing into the ether. Director Elliot Silverstein (<B><A HREF="car_1977.htm">THE
    CAR</A></B> - 1977) has made a film that's not especially violent 
   (it's rated PG), but it is a very intense film. Made back in the day 
   when films rated PG weren't just kid's films, the change in tone from 
   freewheeling to menacing is quite shocking to the system and although 
   we never see much of the violence, the threat hangs heavily in the 
   air. The scene where Jill calls her father on the phone to tell him 
   what happened and then realizes that she can't bear to do so is a 
   wonderful piece of emotional cinema. Although talky in spots, it 
   acquits itself by continually surprising the viewer as the screenplay 
   (by S. Lee Pogostin) never panders or talks down to the audience. 
   This is an adult story where the bad guys are extremely bad (Lee 
   threatens Jill with a knife by saying, &quot;Quiet knives are for 
   loud girls.&quot;) and the good guys find out that doing bad things 
   always comes with a price. Be prepared to pay it. This is an 
   excellent underappreciated thriller that, unfortunately, is not 
   available to the general public. Also starring Jay Robinson, Dennis

   the head at a church confessional and a nurse friend is axed in the 
   chest, Wesley is arrested and charged with both murders. Out on bail, 
   he must figure out if he indeed did the murders during his blackouts 
   or if someone else is involved. It doesn&#146;t help his case that he 
   spent 13 years in a mental institution for accidentally shooting his 
   brother when he was 5 years old. Or was it him? It won&#146;t be hard 
   for you to figure out (Hint: Mother did it.). Wildly outdated, with 
   garish colors, 60&#146;s fashions and hairdos (you can see that even 
   in 1969, McRaney was beginning to lose his hair) and spots of fake 
   gore (axe attacks, stabbings and a severed hand), one can only view 
   this film as an obscure artifact from a baby boomer&#146;s childhood.

   &quot;I gotta feeling it's gonna be another goddamned New York 
   day.&quot; Those words, spoken by police Lt. Tonelli (Richard 
   Castellano), perfectly describes what is about to happen to 
   ex-cop-turned-truck driver Sean Boyd (James Brolin). Sean is a 
   divorced dad who has custody of his young daughter Kathy (Abby 
   Bluestone) and today is Kathy's 13th <A HREF="night_of_the_juggler_1979.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/night of the juggler vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="123" HEIGHT="230" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>birthday.
    While walking her to school, Kathy is grabbed by mistake by 
   delusional kidnapper Gus Soltic (Cliff Gorman), who thinks he is 
   taking the daughter of rich real estate investor Hampton Richmond 
   Clayton III (Marco St. John). As Gus gets away with Cathy in his car, 
   Sean commandeers a cab (driven by a young Mandy Patinkin) and gives 
   chase. And what a chase it is. When both Gus' car and the cab 
   crashes, Gus takes Kathy down into the subway system, with Sean close 
   behind. The chase then leads from the subway to the streets of Times 
   Square, where Gus steals a phone company van and Sean grabs a station 
   wagon belonging to a street preacher (Barton Heyman). The chase 
   continues until Sean crashes the wagon and Gus finally gets away with 
   Kathy. Gus brings Kathy to his dilapidated tenement building (he 
   complains to Kathy about how all the &quot;spics and niggers&quot; 
   have ruined his neighborhood), but he doesn't believe Kathy when she 
   tells him that her father is not wealthy. Lt. Tonelli (who is always 
   complaining about his daughter's upcoming wedding) arrests Sean and 
   brings him downtown, where he runs into old cop nemesis Sgt. Otis 
   Barnes (Dan Hedaya) who, when Sean was a cop, reported Otis for being 
   on the take. Otis tries to give Sean the old rubber hose treatment, 
   but Sean knocks him out, escapes from the precinct and begins his 
   long search for Kathy. Gus calls the Clayton household and demands 
   one million dollars in ransom, still not aware that he has the wrong 
   girl (the man simply won't believe Kathy). The Claytons call the cops 
   and Lt. Tonelli takes Gus' second call, pretending to be Mr. Clayton 
   and suddenly realizes that Gus has Sean's kid. Not only does Sean 
   have to look for his daughter, he must now also dodge the vengeful 
   Otis, who is looking to kill Sean. As Lt. Tonelli sets up the ransom 
   drop, Sean goes through a series of encounters, including a porn 
   house peep show, a guard dog training center and fighting a vicious 
   street gang, as he inches closer to Gus and Kathy.&nbsp; This is one 
   of those films where the City of New York is just as valid a 
   character as the rest of the cast. This is the old New York City, 
   before Rudy Giuliani grabbed it by the shirt collar and shook all the 
   dirt out of it. This is New York City when you could find a hot dog 
   vender on every corner and Times Square was still full of hookers, 
   porn shops and grindhouses. This is New York City when, as soon as 
   you park your car in a &quot;bad&quot; neighborhood<A HREF="pursued_aka_night_of_the_juggler_1979.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pursued aka night of the juggler ad mat small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="195" HEIGHT="177" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>,
    gangs would strip it on the street in a matter of minutes. Ah, the 
   good old days! I almost have a tear in my eye thinking about it. <B><A HREF="night_of_the_juggler_1979b.htm">NIGHT
    OF THE JUGGLER</A></B> is a gritty, grimy thriller that pulls no 
   punches and definitely is not a postcard for New York City tourism. 
   Sean meets the dregs of society, including slimy porn shop workers, 
   pimps, hookers, street gangs and, of course, crooked cops. All is not 
   hopeless for Sean, though, as he does find some helpful people, 
   including a hooker (porn legend Sharon Mitchell) with an important 
   clue, a dog trainer (Julie Carmen) who helps him get through a bad 
   part of town and a couple of cabbies, one who is the only cabbie 
   willing to drive him to Gus' neighborhood. The film's highlight is 
   when Otis chases Sean through the busy streets of New York, firing 
   his shotgun at Sean without caring about all the innocent pedestrians 
   that may get in the way. As Otis is blowing apart newstands, hot dog 
   carts and store windows while Sean is ducking for cover, it looks 
   like the pedestrians on the streets were truly not aware what was 
   about to happen, adding greatly to the realism. The film also takes 
   an unusual turn when Gus and Kathy begin to actually talk to each 
   other, talking about her weight problem (she's a little on the chunky 
   side), his abusive mother and how his neighborhood has literally gone 
   to the dogs, thanks to greedy real estate developers (his reason 
   behind the kidnapping). Gus talks to Kathy as he would to an adult, 
   revealing a lot about his motivations behind all this. James Brolin 
   and Cliff Gorman have never been better, but director Robert Butler 
   (who is mainly a TV director, who occasionally left that medium for 
   theatrical films, like <B><A HREF="turbulence_1997.htm">TURBULENCE</A></B> 
   [1997]) wisely lets New York City take center stage and it never 
   looked more like a junkie begging for a fix than it does here. It 
   just oozes sleaze. I wonder if then-Mayor Ed Koch knew what he was 
   signing-on for here when he OK'd the permits for this. This is a true 
   unsung classic just screaming out for a long-overdue DVD release.

   Dated racial revenge thriller with an unusual storyline and an even 
   more unusual leading man. The film opens with Vance (Micky Dolenz of 
   The Monkees) meeting his sister Denise (Susan McCullough) at the New 
   Orleans airport. Denise has just flown in from Vassar and has some 
   important news to tell Vance, but she wants to wait to spill the 
   beans until they get to th<A HREF="night_of_the_strangler_1972b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/night of the strangler poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="174" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>e
    house of their older brother Dan (James Ralston), a strict Southern 
   lawyer who makes Archie Bunker look like the Pope. Once they are at 
   the house, Denise tells Vance and Dan that she is quitting school 
   because she is getting married next week in New York. Oh, and by the 
   way, she's pregnant and her new husband-to-be is black! Vance, the 
   more liberal of the two brothers, is slightly shocked, but seemingly 
   takes the news in stride. Dan, on the other hand, flies into a blind 
   rage, slapping Denise repeatedly about her face while screaming, 
   &quot;You let a degenerate nigger enter your body?!?&quot; and 
   demanding that she get an abortion. Dan disowns Denise on the spot 
   when she refuses and threatens to kill her &quot;nigger 
   boyfriend&quot;, while rubbing Vance's face in the fact that he is 
   marrying Vance's ex-girlfriend Carol (Ann Barrett) because &quot;she 
   couldn't take any more of your nigger-loving ways!&quot; Vance trys 
   to talk Denise out of the marriage (&quot;These things just don't 
   work'&quot;), but seems to come over to her side once he sees how 
   serious she is about it. Denise flies back to New York and is walking 
   in a park with her black boyfriend Jesse, when a hippie on a bicycle 
   (Michael Wright) carrying a guitar case stops by a park bench and 
   opens the case, which contains a high-powered rifle. He takes careful 
   aim and kills Jesse (attentive viewers will notice that we never see 
   Jesse's face), much to Denise's horror. Denise writes an entry in her 
   diary that says, &quot;The only thing I know is that Dan is 
   responsible for Jesse's death! And Vance - I just don't know about 
   him - Vance?&quot; Someone wearing black Army boots, black gloves and 
   a &quot;Peace&quot; symbol belt buckle then sneaks into Denise's 
   apartment and drowns her in the bathtub. He strips her naked, slits 
   her wrists with a razor and positions her body in the tub to make it 
   look like a suicide; taking a few of Denise's belongings (including 
   her diary and a photo of Vance in the Army) before he leaves. We then 
   follow black priest Father Jessie (Chuck Patterson) as he returns to 
   New Orleans after a long absence in a seminary. Father Babbin 
   (Stocker Fontelieu) informs Jessie of Denise's suicide (he was a 
   family friend since childhood) and asks him to mend the huge rift 
   between Vance and Dan that the suicide caused. Vance has become an 
   alcoholic and shows up at the wedding of Dan and Carol blind stinking 
   drunk. Father Jessie breaks up a fight between Dan and Vance by 
   punching Dan in the face (Dan calls Jessie a &quot;damn black 
   nigger&quot; in church) and escorts Vance outside (but not before a 
   soused Vance calls the wedding &quot;beauty and the bigot&quot;). 
   It's not long before a series of murders begin, all intricate 
   booby-traps that seem to be rooted in Vietnam. Carol is bitten in the 
   face by a poisonous Asian snake that was delivered in a vase of roses 
   that came from Vance's flower shop. Dan, of course, blames Vance, 
   although it is clear to the audience that the killer wears gloves 
   (this time they are white) for a reason. After Dan is forced to shoot 
   and kill his black gardener Willie (Warren J. Kenner) when he holds a 
   knife to Dan's throat (Dan fired Willie for having the gall of 
   talking to Carol without his permission, which led to the death of 
   Willie's sick wife due to him having no money for her medicine), the 
   same hippie that killed Denise's boyfriend attempts to kill Dan (It 
   seems Dan refuses to pay the Mob for the contract hit he put on Jesse 
   in the park, which is a real stupid move), but he is<A HREF="is_the_father_black_enough_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/is the father black enough aka night of the strangler poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="169" HEIGHT="265" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   shot and killed by a passing cop before he can fire his rifle. The 
   real killer steps-up his murder spree, killing Vance's new bride, 
   Anne (Katie Tillie), with a booby-trapped, curare-soaked 
   spring-loaded arrow that impales her back when she sits down in the 
   passenger seat of Vance's car. This makes Vance think that Dan was 
   responsible, so he goes to Dan's house and stabs him in the chest, 
   but Dan shoots and kills Vance with a pistol. The killer reveals 
   himself to a dying Dan (it's really no surprise) and thrusts the 
   knife deeper into Dan's chest after explaining to Dan why he did what 
   he did and declaring, &quot;This jive-ass nigger got you all!&quot; A 
   savvy police detective, Lt. DeVivo (Michael Anthony, who is quite 
   good here), has the final laugh when the killer believes he got away

   a child actor before he became a member of The Monkees. He's actually 
   pretty good as a brother that's torn between two sides: His strict 
   Southern family upbringing and his own conscience, which changed once 
   he served in the Vietnam War. Although the storyline is way too dated 
   (although I can still imagine some Southerners rooting for Dan),

   Robert A. Weaver and Jeffrey Newton keep the film moving at a brisk 
   pace, even though it is rather obvious who the killer is. The 
   Jesse/Father Jessie connection is just too much of a coincidence to 
   be overlooked (especially since we never see Denise's boyfriend's 
   face). James Ralston paints a rather broad stroke as Dan, who is not 
   only a Southern bigot, he's a lawyer, to boot (double hiss!). There's 
   some nice early 70's New Orleans photography and some violent scenes 
   (the car seat booby-trap is a doozy) to keep viewers entertained and 
   there's an air of sleazy 70's exploitation that you just can't

   (1972). Don&#146;t you believe it. What we have here is a sleazy

   girls, on vacation from their parents, get more than they bargain for 
   when they are held captive on the train by a trio of degenerates (a 
   psychopath, a drug addict and a nymphomaniac!). They force the two

   alcohol, sex or violence), it does not seem to affect him. His photo, 
   on the other hand, shows all the effects of the abuse. As time passes 
   by, Dorian becomes hugely successful but, privately, is a wreck (but 
   always looks perfect) as he abuses drugs, abuses women and abuses 
   life, all under the watchful eye of Henry. Dorian begins a slow 
   spiral into depravity which ends in a double murder.&nbsp; Told in a 
   series of flashbacks, <B><A HREF="pact_with_the_devil_2002b.htm">PACT 
   WITH THE DEVIL</A></B> opens up at the scene of the double murder, 
   with Henry telling Detective Giatti (Ron Lea) Dorian's story as the 
   bodies are taken away. Since we are not privy to who is murdered or 
   the reasons behind the murders, Director Allan A. Goldstein (<B><A HREF="death_wish_5_1994.htm">DEATH

   necessarily a bad thing), but anyone familiar with Oscar Wilde's 
   novel won't be surprised by the outcome. As always, McDowell steals 
   the show as the smarmy manager who we all know is just the Devil in 
   disguise. He can be threatening by just raising his eyebrows and be 
   your best friend by doing the same exact thing. The ever-changing 
   photo of Dorian is also a good visual gag. As Dorian is abusing 
   himself, the photo really takes a beating. Ethan Erickson must have 
   been in the makeup chair a few times as, by the end, he looks like a 
   rotting corpse in the final photo. This is an average film made 
   above-average by Malcolm McDowell's performance and some perverse 
   situations. Harry Alan Towers was one of the producers on this

   Barta Barri) arriving at the palatial mansion of Carla (Nadiuska; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#GuyanaCrimeCentury">GUYANA,

   - 1979) for a weekend of drink and debauchery all in the name 
   of...the Marquis De Sade! All the men sit around a table (wearing 
   grotesque rubber masks) deep in the basement of the mansion, when all 
   the women to be used as sexual playthings arrive, including Berta 
   (Theresa Gimpera; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Crypt of Living Dea">CRYPT

   Leonia Devine, Estela Delgado and Carmen Platero. Just as the sexual 
   gameplaying is about to begin, the mansion begins to rumble and 
   glasses and plates fall off the table. The intrepid Professor Fulton 
   (De Mendoza) deducts that a few atomic bombs went <A HREF="people_who_own_the_dark_1975_dvd.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/people who own the dark dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="300" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>off
    and by his findings they have two days to collect all the food and 
   water they will need to survive for two months deep in the mansion's 
   sub-basement before the radioactivity is blown-in by the winds. The 
   men decide to take a trip to the local town to get as much food and 
   bottled water as they can, only to discover that every citizen has 
   turned blind from the bright flashes of the bombs' lights (a fact 
   that is actually true; that why scientists and observers wear special 
   glasses when they watch atomic or nuclear bombs go off; if they 
   didn't, they would go blind). When one of the men overreacts and 
   shoots seven of the blind people dead, the guys stock-up on as much 
   food and water as they can and head back to the mansion, but not 
   before Victor (Pico) snaps the neck of the offending man who killed 
   all those innocent people. Once back at the mansion, they learn that 
   the blind people don't need eyes to exact revenge, begin to storm the 
   castle and at first they are unsuccessful (My favorite line comes 
   when Borne [Naschy] asks Prof. Fulton if they are safe and he replies 
   rather glibly: &quot;Yeah, and the Easter Bunny shits jelly 
   beans!&quot;). Pretty soon the group of unaffected people begin to 
   act strangely, like Pico walking on all fours naked while wearing a 
   grotesque pig mask and constant bickering between the group. The mass 
   of blind people manage to kill a couple who run away and, in one of 
   the film's most effective scenes, the blind people break through the 
   ceiling of one of the rooms and lower the corpses of the dead couple ever-so-slowly
    to the floor, showing that eyes are not necessary to kill (the eyes 
   of the dead woman are cut out!). The remaining people hear a warning 
   on a transistor radio telling them that &quot;The War is over! The 
   War is over!&quot; and to head for the nearest highway to be 
   picked-up by the government and be moved to safety. That is exactly 
   what our intrepid group try, but they are being followed very closely 
   by the blind people, who catch one women, put a pistol in her mouth 
   and pull the trigger. Sooner or later they catch up and kill most of 
   the group, until all that is left are Prof. Fulton and Lily (who were 
   to be paired up as sexual partners before this all began) and they 
   manage to find the main road and are picked-up in a government bus by 
   people wearing radiation suits. Thinking they are finally saved, they 
   don't notice that the bus is being pumped full of poison gas. The 
   last time we see Prof. Fulton and Lily, they are being dumped in a

   make some good points on how the rich believe they deserve more than

   unscathed proves that fact. But like all caste system beliefs, it 
   comes back to bite you in the ass, as these poor &quot;peasants&quot;

   sparse (this isn't really about blood and guts anyway, but revenge), 
   this DVD by Code Red offers two versions: an abridged widescreen 
   anamorphic print that can best be described as in poor shape. It is 
   missing the first five minutes of the film (including the credits) 
   and is full of frame jumps, dialogue cut-off and emulsion scratches. 
   The DVD also offers a fullscreen 82-minute version (the running time 
   of the U.S. theatrical version; the Spanish version [the title is &quot;<B>&Uacute;ltimo

    runs 12 minutes longer) that was taken from a 1 inch Sun Video tape. 
   I still prefer the widescreen version because it is sharper-looking 
   and is really not missing anything important, except for the head-scratching
    discussion about Lenin and Stalin in the beginning of the film (it 
   actually plays better if you never heard that conversation).&nbsp; 
   While <B><A HREF="people_who_own_the_dark_1975_dvd.htm">THE PEOPLE 
   WHO OWN THE DARK</A></B> is not perfect, it is a perfectly fine way 
   to spend 82 minutes of your time and not be bored. When this was 
   originally released to theaters, all the actors were given Anglicized 
   names (Paul Naschy became &quot;Paul Mackey&quot;, Maria Perschy 
   became &quot;Maria Pershing&quot; and so on), even though it looked 
   like most of them were speaking English that was over-dubbed, and it

   fame. When Cunningham was contacted about his involvement with this 
   film, he was honestly confused about the whole situation, since he 
   never heard of the film! It seems the unscrupulous unknown 
   distributor, who released this film theatrically in 1980, just after 
   Cunningham's film became a bonifide smash hit, decided to use his 
   name to increase revenues. I don't know whether it did or not, but 
   VHS tapes and even the Code Red DVD list Sean S. Cunningham as the 
   producer and presenter, a claim I still find highly dubious today.

    VICTIMS</A><A NAME="PerfectVictims1988"></A> (1988) -</B> A sick 
   thriller that's truly a product of it's time. A psychotic man named 
   Brandon Poole (Tom Dugan), mad at the female race because he's 
   contracted the AIDS virus, travels around in his pickup truck 
   infecting women with the disease. Brandon, who works for a moving 
   company, picks his next two victims, aspiring models Carrie (Jackie 
   Swanson) and Melissa (Nikolette Scorcese), when he moves their 
   belongings into a new apartment in Los Angeles. When in the apartment 
   during the moving phase, Brandon drugs the milk in the refrigerator 
   and returns that night to find them passed out on the floor. He 
   breaks into the apartment and what he does next in unbelievably 
   sadistic. He spits through a plastic tube directly into Carrie's nose 
   (!) and then cuts his wrist and bleeds into Melissa's mouth. He then 
   rapes Carrie and when he hears her baby crying in the next room, he 
   screams to Carrie, &quot;I have news for you, slut. Your kid is an 
   orphan!&quot; Police Lt. Kevin White (Clarence Williams III) is 
   assigned to investigate when Carrie and Melissa are brought to the 
   hospital. He at first thinks that the girls are nothing but two 
   cokeheads, but when the medical report comes back that their 
   assailant is infected with AIDS, he knows that there's a new type of 
   serial killer on the loose. Liz Walters (Deborah Shelton, also one of 
   the Executive Producers), the owner of a modeling agency<A HREF="perfect_victims_1988.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/perfect victims vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="139" HEIGHT="250" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   who just signed Carrie and Melissa to contracts, shows up at the 
   hospital concerned about her newest charges. When she appears on TV 
   and condemns the vicious acts of violence, calling the rapist an 
   &quot;animal&quot;, Brandon views it and begins stalking her. His 
   first attack on Liz is unsuccessful, thanks to a stun gun in Liz's 
   purse and the sudden appearance of her boyfriend, Steve (Lyman Ward; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Creature 1984">CREATURE</A></B> 
   - 1984). After infecting another woman he meets at a bar and killing 
   a nosy co-worker and the prostitute he is with, Brandon begins 
   calling Liz on the phone (&quot;Hello, bitch!&quot;) and tells her 
   that she, Carrie and Melissa are &quot;dogmeat&quot; and will not 
   escape his wrath. Lt. White gets an important clue from an old guy 
   walking his dog (genre vet John Agar) and Liz picks up Carrie, her 
   baby and Melissa and brings them to Steve's seaside villa, which is 
   protected by guard dogs. They stupidly put the guard dogs in the 
   garage, which gives Brandon the chance to enter the house and 
   terrorize the three women (and the baby). It's gonna be a long 
   night.&nbsp; The idea of an AIDS-infected serial killer was daring 
   for it's time (it's not even mentioned on the VHS box and any mention 
   of AIDS was edited out of the TV prints!), when contracting the 
   disease was considered a death sentence. We have, of course, come a 
   long way since then, but this film is so sleazy in it's depictions of 
   the way Brandon infects his victims, it's hard to shake-off the dirt. 
   Director/co-scripter/composer Shuki Levy, who would later give us <B><A HREF="blind_vision_1992.htm">BLIND
    VISION</A></B> (1992; also with Shelton, who was once Levi's

    MIGHTY MORPHIN' POWER RANGERS</A></B>, to TV in the mid-90's (still 
   going strong on TV, with a major motion picture released in March of 
   2017!), delivers a film that is devoid of humor (The closest it comes 
   to humor is when Clarence Williams III introduces his character to a 
   hospital nurse by saying, &quot;Hello, I'm White!&quot;, or when one 
   of Brandon's co-workers says to him, &quot;Why don't you lighten up 
   Brandon? Take a dump or something!&quot;) and that's hard to watch in 
   spots, especially the rape scenes. Some scenes bring up the emotional 
   impact of <B><A HREF="last_house_on_the_left2.htm">LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT</A></B> 
   (1972) or <B><A HREF="i_spit_on_your_grave.htm">I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE</A></B> 
   (1978), especially the attack on Carrie and Melissa early in the 
   film. If you aren't aware that Brandon has AIDS when this attack 
   takes place, it loses resonance, so a second viewing is required for 
   this scene to pack an emotional gut-punch. Tom Duggan (<B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#Nightwish1988">NIGHTWISH</A></B> 
   - 1988) is just plain nasty as the woman-hating Brandon. Looking at 
   his pock-marked face and hearing his Southern drawl as he spits out 
   vitriol, calling women &quot;pigs&quot;, &quot;stupid twats&quot; or 
   worse, is as horrendous a villian as you'll ever see in 80's cinema. 
   I wouldn't exactly call <B>PERFECT VICTIMS</B> entertaining cinema, 
   because it's not. What it is, though, is cinema of the extreme, a 
   dirty little film that doesn't shy away from showing us something 
   really seedy and demented. It brings everyone's fear of AIDS (whether 
   justified or not) front and center, a scare film and a cautionary 
   tale from the unsure late 80's. The ending is a little too pat (it 
   feels like it was tacked-on at the last minute to give audiences 
   something to feel good about), but there's also a shocking 
   last-minute discovery hidden in Brandon's apartment that sent chills 
   down my spine (it proves that he has been doing this for quite some 
   time). Not for everyone's tastes, but well-made. Filmed under the

   - 1988) as Adrian Wilde, a nature-cum-fashion photographer (dog 
   photos are his specialty) with more than one shutter out of synch. 
   The first time we meet Adrian, he has talked aspiring model Quinn 
   (Susan Damante) into posing nude in his studio (all tastefully done, 
   since this is a PG-rated film) before taking her to a secluded 
   section of Griffith Park for the conclusion of the photo shoot, where 
   he poisons Quinn's drink and takes photos of her in the throes of 
   death. After placing her corpse back in her car, Adrian heads home to 
   have dinner with his overbearing, alcoholic mother (Barbara Nichols: <B><A HREF="power_1968.htm">THE
    POWER</A></B> - 1968), who constantly belittles him every chance she 
   gets. Adrian was seriously scarred emotionally as a child when he 
   discovered his mother screwing some random guy and was nearly 
   strangled by mom's lover when he was caught spying on them. It seems 
   Mrs. Wilde hasn't changed much since Adrian was a child, as she still 
   has affairs with younger men, including Adrian's friend Clinton 
   (Associate Producer Spencer Milligan). Adrian's childhood psychosis

    the surprised look on the face of Quinn's corpse and he vows to find 
   her murderer. When forensic pathologist Joe Hennesey (Jed Allen) ties 
   Quinn's murder to an earlier killing of another young woman, Luther 
   and Sid realize they have a serial killer on the loose. Adrian kills 
   middle-aged Karri Stephenson (Betty Anne Rees) next when he comes to 
   her home to take photos of her prized schnauzer and she makes a pass 
   at him (He throws a clock radio into her bathtub, electrocuting her, 
   after screaming over-and-over, &quot;Don't kiss me, Mother!&quot; in 
   a scene that will have you howling in [unintentional?] laughter). 
   Adrian's favorite hangout is a bowling alley (One day I'm going to do 
   a list of genre films that have scenes of bowling alleys in them, as 
   there are just too many for it to be a coincidence), where he and 
   Clinton spend their time bowling a few frames, hatching hair-brained 
   schemes and ordering beer from pretty waitress Candy (Patty Bodeen), 
   who has the hots for Adrian. Adrian steps-up his killing spree (he 
   strangles the owner of a dog show and hangs another model in a 
   deserted mansion) and starts to get sloppy, leaving clues at the 
   crime scenes which Luther and Sid slowly begin putting together. But 
   before they can arrest Adrian, he is stabbed to death by Candy (the 
   only woman Adrian showed any romantic interest in), who has a deadly 
   secret from her past and is much more psychotic than Adrian could 
   ever hope to be. Her secret is a doozy and makes for a fitting and 
   ironic demise for poor Adrian.&nbsp; While <B><A HREF="photographer_1973b.htm">THE
    PHOTOGRAPHER</A></B> could never be accused of being a good film 
   (it's just too disjointed to gel as a whole), it is still a fun film 
   to watch, if only for the strange predilections of nearly every main 
   character. Director/producer/screenwriter William Byron Hillman (who 
   remade this film in 1982 as <B><A HREF="#DoubleExposure1982">DOUBLE EXPOSURE</A></B>,
    with Michael Callan returning as Adrian Wilde) certainly gives his 
   characters some strange habits, whether it's Adrian's hatred of women 
   (he's not gay, but he performs some uniquely outrageous monologues, 
   where he looks into a mirror and takes on the personae of both his 
   mother and his younger, boyish, self that must be heard and seen to 
   be fully appreciated); Mrs. Wilde's nightly excursions to get soused 
   and laid; Clinton's obsessions with dogs and stolen merchandise; 
   Luther's promise to himself to stick to a healthy diet while partner 
   Sid crams junk food into his mouth in nearly every scene he is in; 
   and, finally, coroner Joe trying to create the perfect tomato soup or 
   eating opulent meals in the morgue. Callan overacts shamelessly as 
   Adrian (at one point he growls like a dog while chasing one victim 
   [there's a lot of images and talk of dogs strewn throughout the 
   film]), so much so, he quickly becomes more a caricature than 
   character, but he's a hoot-and-a-half to watch. Director Hillman (who 
   also made the David Heavener actioner <B><A HREF="ragin_cajun_1991.htm">RAGIN'

    A man in a toga named Mattia Grandi welcomes prostitute Laura 
   Falconieri (Greta Vajant; <B><A HREF="balsamus_man_of_satan_1970.htm">BALSAMUS,
    MAN OF SATAN</A></B> - 1970) into his home (where opening his front 
   door is akin to opening a safe!). It's time for some S&amp;M, as 
   Laura slaps Mattia hard across the face (he kisses her hand and says 
   he hopes his face didn't hurt it!). Mattia says, &quot;Do it 
   again!&quot; as Laura puts her hands around his neck, choking the 
   life out of him and leaving a drawing from a book of children's fairy 
   tales next to his dead body. Then, Daniele Patucchi's (<B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#Sacrifice!1972">SACRIFICE!</A></B> 
   - 1972) funky music score fills the room as the opening credits play, 
   where we see Laura traveling home on a bus. When the bus stops at her 
   destination (she's the only passenger), she tries to get off, but the 
   door doesn't open. She screams at the bus driver to open the door, 
   when she sees a black-gloved (what else?) figure coming towards her, 
   large wrench in hand. The figure then splits her head open with it, 
   leaving another drawing from the same children's book on her dead body.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Inspector Gaspare Lomenzo (Michele Placido; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#PyjamaGirlCase">THE
    PYJAMA GIRL CASE</A></B> - 1977) is in charge of investigating the 
   deaths of Mattia and Laura, so he and his assistant, Giotto 
   (co-screenwriter Enrico Oldoini), pull-in a group of prostitutes and 
   question them. One hooker tells the Inspector that Mattia was into 
   S&amp;M, so he should question prostitutes from the fetish area in 
   Porta Volta. He is then chewed-out by the Chief Inspector (Tom 
   Skerritt; <B><A HREF="devils_rain_1975.htm">THE DEVIL'S RAIN</A></B> 
   - 1975; who doesn't dub his own voice) for not investigating any of 
   the eight other murders committed during the day (Rome was tough in 
   the '70s!). He tells the Chief Investigator that Mattia and Laura's 
   murders are connected, because both of them had pages from the same 
   book, a German children's fairy tale titled &quot;Shock-Headed 
   Peter&quot;, on their bodies. The Chief Inspector tells him to find a 
   connection and to make it quick. Some other detectives then chime-in 
   with their own theories of the crimes. One detective blames it on a 
   sexually permissive society hooked on violent movies and TV shows, 
   while another says, based on the theories of Freud, the killer is a 
   lunatic who wants to get caught. Inspector Lomenzo doesn't recognize 
   that detective and asks his name, and it turns out he is not a 
   detective at all, but rather a thief that has been collared, showing 
   the Inspector the handcuffs on his wrists!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see the killer pasting the newspaper obituary notices for 
   Mattia and Laura into a scrapbook. Inspector Lomenzo goes home, where 
   he meets a &quot;foxy chick&quot; on the elevator. He goes home to 
   his black girlfriend Ruth (Mary Ruth League), telling her about the 
   foxy chick he has seen on the elevator several times (he even makes a 
   &quot;jungle bunny&quot; joke!). We are then at the offices of sleazy 
   private investigator Peter Struwwel (Eli Wallach; <B><A HREF="stateline_motel_1973.htm">STATELINE
    MOTEL</A></B> - 1973; who also doesn't dub his own voice), who has 
   cameras and other electronic surveillance equipment throughout the 
   building so he can keep tabs on his associates and look at young 
   female asses! He has his associate Pandolfi (Jacques Herlin; <B><A HREF="secret_agent_super_dragon_1966.htm">SECRET
    AGENT SUPER DRAGON</A></B> - 1966) record a conversation he is 
   having with Angelo Scanavini (Quinto Parmeggiani; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#WeekendMurders1970">WEEKEND
    MURDERS</A></B> - 1970), a friend of Mattia and Laura who is not 
   satisfied with how the police investigation is going.&nbsp; He tells 
   Peter he believes their murders have something to do with an event 
   that happened at &quot;Villa Hoffmann&quot; four years earlier. He 
   was at Villa Hoffmann with a group of people who called themselves 
   the &quot;Wildlife Friends&quot; and a prostitute was accidentally 
   killed. The Inspector questions Peter about Villa Hoffmann, but Peter 
   seems more interested in rubbing all his electronic equipment in the 
   Inspector's face, knowing full well that the police department can't 
   afford such things, but he does give the Inspector important 
   information on Villa Hoffmann's owner, big game hunter and black 
   marketeer Hoffmann (John Steiner; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#DeportWomenSS1976">DEPORTED
    WOMEN OF THE SS SPECIAL SECTION</A></B> - 1976). But the Inspector 
   has more pressing matters, namely a hooker that is tied to a tree by 
   the killer, doused in gasoline and burned alive, another page from 
   the German fairy tale book left by her burned dead body (a really 
   graphic and well-done sequence). We then see Angelo Scanavini go home 
   to his sick mother (his front door is protected by the same safe-like 
   device as Mattia's), where he hears his mother's day nurse moaning 
   loudly in the bathroom, masturbating! When she leaves, Angelo sits 
   down in front of the TV and watches a live interview program, where 
   one of his friends is talking about Italy's bad economy. Suddenly, 
   while his friend is talking, he is shot in the head! (I told you Rome 
   was a tough town!). Is this killing related to the other murders? 
   You're damn right it is!</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At a party with his girlfriend, the Inspector notices the foxy chick 
   is sitting on the couch. She notices him, too. Ruth, who is a model, 
   leaves the party with a photographer named Evelyn. The Inspector, 
   thinking Evelyn is a woman, is shocked to discover she is actually a 
   man (and a good-looking one), so Ruth leaves the party with him (and 
   disappears for the rest of the film), giving the Inspector the 
   perfect opportunity to meet the foxy chick. Her name is Jeanne 
   (Corinne Cl&eacute;ry; <B><A HREF="#Hitch-Hike1978">HITCH-HIKE</A></B> 
   - 1978) and they begin a love affair. The Chief Inspector wants him 
   to investigate the man killed on live TV, not knowing that it is 
   linked to the three other murders he is currently investigating. (we 
   watch the killer paste the man's obituary announcement into the scrapbook).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This is what happens in the first 30 minutes of the film, as we 
   discover what actually happened at Villa Hoffmann four years earlier. 
   The &quot;Wildlife Friends&quot; were having a &quot;wildlife 
   orgy&quot; with a bunch of prostitutes and are &quot;playfully&quot; 
   torturing young prostitute Rosa Catena (Sarah Ceccarini; <B><A HREF="nazi_love_camp_27_1977.htm">NAZI
    LOVE CAMP 27</A></B> - 1977), making her believe that they are going 
   to feed her to a live tiger kept on the grounds. She has a heart 
   attack and dies, but Hoffman doesn't want the police to know about 
   the orgies, so they cover-up Rosa's death, having a doctor pronounce 
   her dead of cardiac arrest at another location. At this orgy were all 
   the murdered people, as well as Angelo Scanavini and Jeanne, all of 
   them witnessing Rosa's death. We must figure out who is responsible 
   for the murders and what the pages in the German fairy tale book 
   represent (If you know German, you could have guessed who was 
   responsible almost immediately!). We learn that anyone can kill, 
   given the right circumstances (and the killer's name is mentioned in 
   this review).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Half the fun of discovering who the killer is is the trip 
   director/co-screenwriter Paolo Cavara (<B><A HREF="deaf_smith_and_johnny_ears_1972.htm">DEAF
    SMITH AND JOHNNY EARS</A></B> - 1972) takes us on. When we first see 
   the Wildlife Friends in action, they are watching an animated porn 
   cartoon that must be seen to be believed (it has<A HREF="plot_of_fear_1976_foreign_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/plot of fear italy poster4 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="156" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   to do with a twirling mechanical penis being inserted into a woman's 
   bottom!). The film is full of weird set-pieces like this, most of 
   them humorous. The film wouldn't have worked if not for the 
   exceptional performance of Michele Placido as the Inspector, a 
   tour-de-force of bewilderment and humorous asides. His seduction of 
   Jeanne is worth the price of admission alone, as it is both funny and 
   sexy (<B>Jeanne:</B> &quot;Are you in love with me?&quot; <B>Inspector:</B> 
   &quot;Yeah, but pretend I didn't tell you!&quot;). As with most 
   giallo films, there is some extreme nudity (Corrine Clery never 
   looked more beautiful), as well as some graphic violence, including 
   the burning of the hooker and Angelo Scanavini's death, where he is 
   hit by a car and his face goes through the windshield. We also take a 
   trip to a slaughterhouse where, among the slaughtered pigs, hangs the 
   body of another male member of the Wilderness Friends, a meathook 
   sticking out of his neck and other sights, some bloody, some humorous 
   (such as the Inspector questioning a drunk woman). While it's hard to 
   ignore Tom Skerritt and Eli Wallach speaking in voices that are not 
   their own (they both have distinctive speech patterns, although the 
   person who dubs Wallach does a very good job of matching his lip 
   movements), there is much to enjoy here, more than enough to overlook 
   a couple of hiccups. I wish Paolo Cavara made more films like this, 
   but he died rather young at the age of 56 in 1982. The wonderful 
   screenplay was written by Cavara and co-star Enrico Oldoini (who 
   would turn to directing, making <B><A HREF="bye_bye_baby_1988.htm">BYE

   reason, begins to scream and we find out it was all a nightmare. He 
   wakes up at the beach, where he is relaxing and catching some rays. 
   Along comes Andrea Hillard (Dyanne Thorne; <B><A HREF="ilsa_she_wolf_of_the_ss_1974.htm">ILSA:

    DISEMBODIED</A></B> - 1957), and they strike up a conversation. She 
   agrees to come to the Lobster House to hear him sing (and to start a

   Simms; <B><A HREF="auntie_lees_meat_pies_1992.htm">AUNTIE LEE'S MEAT PIES</A></B> 
   - 1991) to the Lobster House, where they watch Tony belt out 
   &quot;Drifter Of The Heart&quot;. Andrea invites Tony back to her 
   house, where she agrees to cut a record of an original song Tony has 
   wrote and then they make out a little. Martin hears and sees the 
   whole thing and when Andrea brings Tony to the recording studio to 
   sing &quot;Lifebeats&quot;, everyone likes what they hear, even 
   Martin, who gets a phone call from one of his cronies at the studio. 
   Martin tells his crony to release the record (hey, he likes to make 
   money just like the rest of us!), but it will be the last recording 
   of Tony's career, because he will make sure that his contract will 
   ensure that he will never cut another record again. When Martin spots 
   Andrea and Tony making love in the huge built-in pool (Thorne nudity 
   alert!), he waits for <A HREF="point_of_terror_1971b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/point of terror dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="284" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Tony
    to leave and confronts Andrea. They get into a terrible fight (It 
   seems Andrea was drunk one night when driving her and Martin home, 
   which resulted in an accident that put Martin in the wheelchair. She 
   may also have been involved in the stabbing death of Martin's first 
   wife, where, in flashbacks, we see someone in a mask stabbing her 
   over-and-over with a huge knife, the only really bloody scene in the 
   entire film.) and Andrea uses Martin and his wheelchair like some 
   mock bullfight, where Martin falls in the pool and drowns. The police 
   deem it an accident, but little does Andrea know is that Tony never 
   really left. He watched the whole murder just out of sight. At 
   Martin's funeral, Tony meets Martin's daughter Helayne (Lory Hanson), 
   a beautiful young woman who Andrea made Martin send away to boarding 
   school in Europe when they were married. It's apparent that it is 
   love at first sight for the both of them, but Andrea threatens to 
   destroy Tony's career (even after telling her that he saw her murder 
   Martin) if he gets any closer to Helayne. While Andrea is away for a 
   month on business, Tony ignores Andrea's threats and romances Helayne 
   (taking her on a romantic horseback ride), even after Fran tells her 
   that Tony and Andrea were having an affair. Helayne doesn't care 
   because she actually cares about Tony and they quickly get married in 
   Tijuana, Mexico. When Andrea comes home and finds out that Tony has 
   married Helayne, she laughs in his face, telling him that Helayne 
   will get none of Martin's vast fortune, because there is a 
   stipulation in his will that states if Helayne gets married before 
   she turns twenty-five, she is cut out of the will. When Tony tells 
   Andrea that he doesn't care (turns out he loves Helayne as much as 
   she loves him), Andrea gets pissed-off and tells Tony his recording 
   days are over. Tony tells her that he'll find some other way to make 
   a living, which further infuriates Andrea and she begins kicking him 
   in the nuts and biting his leg. When she jumps on Tony's back, he 
   twirls her around and she falls over the fence by the swimming pool 
   and dies on the rocky shore over a hundred feet below. The detective 
   involved in the case determines it is an accident (while he helps 
   himself to all the deserts and fruits at the poolside!) and Tony and 
   Helayne are free to continue their happy marriage. Well, almost. Just 
   before they got married, Tony's sometimes-girlfriend Sally (Paula 
   Mitchell; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Mad Bomber">THE MAD BOMBER</A></B> 
   - 1972) informs him that she is pregnant. Tony told her to get an 
   abortion and when he got back from Tijuana, he would check in on her. 
   After Andrea's death, Tony gets a call from Sally and she wants him 
   to meets her at her house. Once there, Sally unloads a few bullets 
   into Tony's chest and Tony falls down to the ground. He screams his 
   last dying breath and suddenly wakes up on the same beach as we saw 
   in the beginning of the film. Yes, this was all a nightmare, but when 
   Andrea stops by to introduce herself, Tony realizes that he is about 
   to relive the nightmare all over again. Ah, the circle of life!&nbsp;

   to much. This was the last film in the short-lived career of Peter 
   Carpenter (who co-produced and co-wrote the story of this fim with 
   Chris Marconi and starred/co-wrote in the previously-mentioned <B><A HREF="blood_mania_1970.htm">BLOOD

   IMDb lists as passing away in December of 1971 and co-star Leslie 
   Simms (in a DVD interview extra; she says that Marconi was gay and 
   that the definitely straight Carpenter's real first name was 
   &quot;Page&quot;, which his agent made him change to 
   &quot;Peter&quot;) claims he died between 1978 to 1981 of 
   complications due to pneumonia. Whatever the truth, it's a shame, 
   because Carpenter could have been a fairly decent leading man in 
   B-films (he actually sings all the songs in this film, too) and he is 
   clearly the best thing about this film (well, besides Thorne's naked 
   breasts, that is). He even does some full backside nudity, so you can 
   see his ass, a treat for all the ladies and gay men in the audience. 
   Carpenter only made four films, including (besides the three already 
   mentioned) <B><A HREF="love_me_like_i_do_1970.htm">LOVE ME LIKE I DO</A></B>

   It's March of 2021 as I am writing this and I have just discovered 
   that Peter Carpenter didn't die in the '70s as many people thought. 
   He actually quit acting in 1971 when his career as an actor didn't 
   pan out like he thought it would and went into hiding in Los Angeles, 
   California, opening up a dance studio under his real name (Nathaniel 
   Joseph Carpenter), where he taught dance and then became a painter, 
   dying on April 2, 1996 of A.I.D.S. at the age of 56 (not of natural 
   causes as it is erroneously reported on IMDb). It was easy to hide 
   from the public in the '70s, '80s &amp; early-'90s, since the 
   Internet wasn't around and long before everyone had a camera at their 
   disposal, so Carpenter lived his life, dated many beautiful women and 
   ran a business where no one noticed him. Still, it's a sad ending for 
   someone who I admired. He had all the elements to become a good genre 
   actor, but he made his decision and stood by it. Another long mystery resolved!</FONT></FONT></P>

   over and over again on a TV set next to her bed. When she unplugs the 
   TV, Richard turns off the water, takes away her clothes and refuses 
   to give her anything to eat until she plugs the TV back in. After a 
   couple of days without water or food (she stoops so low as to drink 
   some water from the toilet tank!), she gives in and plugs the TV set 
   back in. Richard turns the water back on, buys her some expensive 
   clothes and cooks her a gourmet dinner. She gets drunk, does a 
   striptease in front of the camera and has hot sex with Richard. After 
   the act is done, Emanuelle unsuccessfully tries to escape, which 
   really ticks Richard off. He takes all her clothes, towels and 
   blankets and turns off the water again until she repents and tells 
   him that it is a man&#146;s world and she will do whatever he wants. 
   Richard accepts her apology and has sex with her again. The tables 
   are turned when Richard is duped by Emanuelle and gets trapped in his 
   own escape-proof rooms. It is now Emanuelle&#146;s turn to play her 
   televised speech over and over again to an unappreciative Richard. 
   And she likes it! Completely devoid of violence, this low-budget 
   erotic thriller relies heavily on the ample naked charms of Shannon 
   Whirry (</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Animal Instincts">ANIMAL

   violence to get his way (even Emanuelle&#146;s kidnapping is 
   painless). Richard would rather use mental torture than harm 
   Emanuelle physically. Bo Svenson and Rip Taylor (sans hairpiece) have 
   cameos as a private dick and travel agent respectively. Lee Frost not 
   only wrote and directed, he also edited (he shows some editing 
   prowess in a scene involving a doggie door), wrote the lyrics to some 
   of the songs and puts in a brief appearance as a private dick named 
   Jerry. This film is basically a two character play, and while it is 
   slow going in some spots, it does hold the attention due to 
   Whirry&#146;s uninhibited performance. This is not the best film of 
   Frost&#146;s career, but new Frost is better than no Frost at all.

    Dover, England October 12, 1959 11:45 AM: Little schoolgirl Virginia 
   (Fausta Avelli; <B><A HREF="#RingsOf Fear1978">RINGS OF FEAR</A></B> 
   - 1978) is in Florence, Italy and suffers from &quot;visions&quot;. 
   This particular vision shows her mother (Elizabeth Turner; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Cannibal Apoc">CANNIBAL
    APOCALYPSE</A></B> - 1980) driving to the top of the white cliffs of 
   Dover, getting out of her car and then committing suicide by jumping 
   off the top of the cliffs, her face tearing away as it hits the rocks 
   on her way down (a very good and gory effect). Little Virginia 
   screams and then we are transported to 1977 Italy, where the adult 
   Virginia (Jennifer O'Neill; <B><A HREF="flower_in_his_mouth_1975.htm">THE
    FLOWER IN HIS MOUTH</A></B> - 1975) is driving to the airport with 
   her husband Francesco (Gianni Garko; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightOfThe Devils72">NIGHT
    OF THE DEVILS</A></B> - 1972) and then watches him as he flies away 
   on a small plane on business. On the drive home, Virginia has another 
   vision, where she sees an elderly woman being murdered by a man with 
   a limp, who then walls her up in bricks, hiding her body in a house. 
   Pay very close to this vision, because it contains nearly all the 
   visual clues to solve this mystery and there are many. After the 
   vision is over, Virginia is snapped out of her trance by a policeman 
   knocking on her car window, as she subconsciously pulled the car over 
   to the side of the road. Virginia then goes to the office of her good 
   friend, parapsychologist Luca Fattori (Marc Porel; <B><A HREF="action.htm#LiveLikeA Cop">LIVE
    LIKE A COP, DIE LIKE A MAN</A></B> - 1976), and tells him about her 
   latest vision. Luca is familiar with her visions, as he tape-records 
   every one, which his secretary, Bruna (Jenny Tamburi; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SuspicDeathMinor75">THE
    SUSPICIOUS DEATH OF A MINOR</A></B> - 1975), transcribes, writing 
   them down in a journal (which is also important in solving this mystery).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A short time later, Virginia, who is an interior decorator by trade, 
   decides to surprise her husband by restoring his childhood home, 
   which he hasn't been to in many years. As soon as the caretaker (Vito 
   Passeri; Fulci's <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#DontTortureDuck72">DON'T
    TORTURE A DUCKLING</A></B> - 1972) takes Virginia into the house, 
   where all the furniture and wall hangings are covered in dusty white 
   sheets, she gets the eerie feeling that she has been there before. As 
   she starts removing the sheets from the living room, she realizes 
   this is the same room as her latest vision, same mirror, same red 
   lampshade, same everything, only a dresser is blocking the area where 
   she saw the old woman being walled-up. She moves the dresser and 
   begins destroying the wall with a hand pickaxe she found in the 
   basement, eventually finding a skeleton behind the bricks. The police 
   are called in, but Inspector Rossi (Paolo Pacino) is rightfully 
   baffled as to how Virginia knew there was a body in the wall, as she 
   told him this was the first time she was physically in the house, but 
   she saw the murder of an old woman in a vision (Would you believe 
   her?). When the police take the skeleton away, the forensics 
   department determines that the skeleton is that of a model who 
   disappeared in 1972...oh, and she was only 35 years old. That can't 
   be says Virginia, the woman in her vision was much older, but when 
   the Inspector shows her and Francesco a photo of the model, Virginia 
   remembers seeing her on a magazine cover in her vision, but what can 
   that possibly mean? Francesco then confesses that he dated the model 
   long before he met Virginia, but one day she just disappeared and he 
   never saw her again. The Inspector arrests Francesco on suspicion of 
   murder and throws him in jail, while Virginia tries to prove him 
   innocent, with the help of Luca, Bruna and her journal (which Luca 
   didn't even know that she created).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Virginia remembers a yellow taxicab in her vision and Bruna, who is 
   a veritable encyclopedia, mentions that taxis didn't become yellow in 
   this town until 1972 and since there were only 16 yellow cabs in 
   1972, they should question the drivers to see if they remember the 
   model and where they took her. They hit pay dirt with one of the 
   drivers, who remembers picking up the model (He remembers her wearing 
   a miniskirt, saying, &quot;I saw everything!&quot;), but she wasn't 
   alone. She was with a bearded man...who walked with a limp and the 
   driver dropped them off at an art gallery (Which Virginia and Luca go 
   to, picking up another clue from her vision, a Vermeer painting). 
   They then discover that the bearded man is Emilio Rospini (Gabriele 
   Ferzetti; <B><A HREF="smiling_maniacs_1975.htm">THE SMILING MANIACS</A></B> 
   - 1975), who was a Superintendent of the town back in 1972, but he is 
   now a professor at the university.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The only problem is, according to Virginia, the man in her vision 
   didn't have a beard and according to photos from 1972, Emilio always 
   had the beard. In the next scene (which takes place in 1977), we see 
   a barber shaving off Emilio's beard, telling the barber that his wife 
   thinks he looks better without it. It the becomes obvious (at least 
   to me), that Virginia's vision didn't take place in the past, it's a 
   vision of the future (it makes perfect sense, the hole on the wall, 
   Emilio shaving off his beard, the old woman still being alive, as 
   Virginia saw her recently, etc). But the questions then become: Why 
   did Virginia have a vision of the future, since all her other visions 
   were of the immediate present or the past? Why did she have this 
   specific vision? Can she stop it from happening and can she get her 
   husband and the police to believe her? (Francesco doesn't believe in 
   visions, even after being thrown in jail) Is Virginia's life in danger?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Francesco's sister, Gloria (Evelyn Stewart; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightChild1975">THE
    NIGHT CHILD</A></B> - 1975), smokes the same hand-rolled cigarettes 
   (in yellow rolling paper) as in Virginia's vision and she blames 
   Virginia for putting her brother in jail. Virginia does get a clue 
   from Gloria that places her husband in the United States when the 
   model was killed, but it is not enough proof for the Inspector or the 
   Police Commissioner (Fabrizio Jovine; Fulci's <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Contraband1980">CONTRABAND</A></B> 
   - 1980) to get her husband released from prison. The old woman from 
   Virginia's vision calls Virginia and leaves a message on her 
   answering machine, telling Virginia that she can &quot;help&quot; 
   her. Help her how? When Virginia plays back the message for Luca, he 
   tells her to forget about it, it is probably a crank call.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Virginia gets an idea on how to free her husband, so she pretends to 
   be a reporter for the New York Times, goes to Emilio's house and 
   discovers that the old woman is actually Emilio's rich wife, Giovanna 
   (Lorendana Savelli). When Giovanna leaves the room, Virginia accuses 
   Emilio of killing the model, telling him she knows he was having an 
   affair with her. As more clues from Virginia's vision become clear, 
   it becomes obvious that Virginia herself is responsible for the 
   actions in her vision. If Virginia never accused Emilio of sleeping 
   with the murdered model, his extremely wealthy wife would have never 
   knew (she overheard Virginia's accusations against her husband). She 
   threatens to divorce Emilio, leaving him penniless, which is why he 
   must kill her before she contacts a lawyer, but he never gets the 
   chance to brick her up (Watch the film to find out why). Not only is 
   Virginia guilty of a future crime, her actions may be responsible for 
   her own murder (by someone close to her). Can Virginia stop it before 
   it happens? It doesn't turn out the way you think it will.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This may be Lucio Fulci's most intrinsically plotted film, as nearly 
   every scene has an important clue to solving the mystery. Since we 
   basically know whodunit (but do we really?), the film becomes a 
   really tense thriller as we wonder if Virginia will collect all the 
   clues in time and solve<A HREF="psychic_1977_foreign_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/psychic 1977 italy poster2 small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="213" HEIGHT="306" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   her vision.&nbsp; The screenplay, written by Fulci, Dardano Sacchetti 
   (Argento's <B><A HREF="#CatONineTails1971">THE CAT O' NINE TAILS</A></B> 
   - 1971; Fulci's <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HouseByCemetery1981">THE

    WOMEN FOR THE KILLER</A></B> - 1974), is well thought-out and makes 
   perfect sense, but just like any vision (or dream), it takes time to 
   make clear, putting the clues together in a cohesive whole. The 
   biggest stumbling block that Virginia has to go through is that no 
   one will believe her, not her husband, not the police, not even Luca, 
   but it will become clear to the viewer why certain people are too 
   quick to refuse, as they have hidden agendas and secrets of their own 
   that they don't want exposed in a vision.&nbsp; Virginia doesn't help 
   herself when she stages the crime scene to fit her vision (knocking 
   over a statue, leaving the mirror wide open to be shattered, moving 
   furniture around), which only leaves her wide open to harm from 
   people she thought she trusted. You will also question some of 
   Virginia's actions, but it will all become clear during the film's 
   white-knuckle finale, which I won't give away here. Those expecting a 
   Fulci gorefest, in the vein of his <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Zombie">ZOMBIE</A></B> 
   (1979) or <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NewYorkRipper1982">THE NEW 
   YORK RIPPER</A></B> (1982), are going to be disappointed (there's 
   just the opening suicide and later shots of a bloody head), but those 
   who like a crackling good mystery (Such as Fulci's <B><A HREF="#LizardWomansSkin">A
    LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN</A></B> - 1971), with a thought provoking 
   ending, are going to be rewarded in spades. I'll just leave you to

   the re-edited American version of the film, but that print was only

   no way a Giallo film by any stretch of the imagination, is an

    The film opens with Licia (Adrienne Larussa; the lead in Lucio 
   Fulci's <B><A HREF="beatrice_cenci_1969.htm">BEATRICE CENCI</A></B> - 
   1969) making love to her boyfriend Mario (Nino Castelnuovo (<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#StripNudeKiller">STRIP
    NUDE FOR YOUR KILLER</A></B> - 1975) in a whorehouse (It was his 
   idea, to put some excitement in their lovemaking). After telling 
   Licia that he loves her, but she will never be able to love him 
   because he isn't wealthy, she tells Mario that money doesn't matter 
   to her, she does love him. Suddenly, the whorehouse is raided by the 
   police and Mario and Licia escape through a back door, but are met by 
   Press reporters and photographers at the door, who take pictures of 
   Licia and Mario coming out of the house of ill repute. Yes, this was 
   a setup created by Mario to blackmail Licia's rich industrialist 
   father, Marco Brignoli (Rossano Brazzi; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#FormulaMurder1985">FORMULA
    FOR A MURDER</A></B> - 1985), for a huge sum of money. Marco has 
   just opened a huge factory in town that would employ most of the 
   people living there, so a story like this would ruin him if he 
   doesn't buy himself out of this mess and do something with his 
   daughter. He wants to put Licia into an insane asylum for a period of 
   time to make it look like his daughter has some serious mental 
   issues, but Licia refuses to go, packing her bags and going to 
   Mario's place to live with him, but when she gets there, she 
   discovers a huge satchel of cash lying on the floor and knows her 
   father is there. He appears and Licia finally knows that Mario set 
   her up and doesn't love her, he was only interested in the money. 
   Defeated, broken and all alone, Licia agrees to go to the mental 
   asylum, so her father (or, rather, his chauffeur) drives her to the 
   asylum for a &quot;short&quot; stay. Once in the asylum, Licia is 
   kept in a heavily drugged state, her only visitor being her sister 
   Giovanna (Paola Pitagora; <A HREF="action.htm#Revolver1973"><B>REVOLVER</B></A> 
   - 1973), who brings flowers every time she visits. Her daddy 
   basically ignores her, never coming to visit her, but things are 
   about to change when she is released unannounced from the asylum. 
   Daddy will no longer be able to ignore her again. Licia has a plan to 
   make her father's and, everyone else she believes who did her wrong, 
   lives a living hell and the way she does it is quite unique and deadly.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The first place Licia goes to is Mario's swanky new home (paid with 
   her father's bribe money) and she pulls a pistol on Mario, but 
   instead of killing him, she makes him a partner in her plan to get 
   revenge. He happily agrees because he now has access to Licia's 
   heavenly body again. The next stop Licia makes is her father's 
   mansion, but the only people happy to see her are Giovanna and her 
   handsome new husband Francesco (Alberto de Mendoza; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#HumanCobras1971">HUMAN
    COBRAS</A></B> - 1971). Licia begins to put the moves on Francesco, 
   first at the pool in a skimpy bikini, but Giovanna&nbsp; thinks it is 
   funny because her sister is probably lonely after spending time in 
   the asylum (Giovanna also believes even though Francesco loves her, 
   he only married her for her family's money). Licia decides to put a 
   little pain in Giavanna and Francesco's marriage, as she removes the 
   electric power cord from the electric grill and places the plug in 
   the pool's water just for a second, just to give her sister and 
   husband the shock of their lives (Licia smiles after watching 
   Giavanna and Francesco twitching in pain). Licia's plans are 
   downright intellectual, using fishing line to move a mirror and her 
   bedroom door so when Francesco is sleeping in bed, he can see Licia 
   lying nude on her bed, tempting him even more, but he still won't 
   come to her. Licia then attends her father's meeting with an 
   important Church Monsignore (Marcello Bonini Olas; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#BlackMagicRites1973">BLACK
    MAGIC RITES</A></B> - 1973), where he intends on showing footage of 
   how his new factory is beneficial to everyone in town, but when the 
   film begins to play, we see footage of Marco undressing his mistress, 
   Laura (Idelma Carlo), who is the wife of an important politician 
   (Nestor Garay; <B><A HREF="defeat_of_the_mafia_1968_1970.htm">DEFEAT 
   OF THE MAFIA</A></B> - 1970) who is partners with Marco in the 
   factory, Laura making all the important business decisions in Marco's 
   life, like he is her puppet. Marco believes his enemies are doing 
   this to him to ruin him, not knowing that all this is Licia's doing.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Licia then turns her attention to her father's nerdy press secretary 
   Paterlini (Renzo Petretto) by bringing him to Mario's house, getting 
   him on the couch and undressing him, but Mario suddenly appears, 
   camera in hand and takes pictures of Paterlini and Licia 
   together.&nbsp; Licia tells him if he doesn't tell her where her 
   father is buying land to complete the second phase of the factory, 
   she will release the photos to the Press and her father. Paterlini 
   knows if this happens, his life is ruined, so her tells her the 
   location of the property. We then see a bunch of hippies painting 
   signs and planting them on the property, the signs denouncing Marco 
   and his business practices, forcing the second phase to not happen 
   and nearly ruining Marco (Laura leaves him after giving him a 
   tongue-lashing for being a lousy businessman and lover). Things turn 
   deadly when Licia tempts Francesco one too many times. This time she 
   throws pebbles at the window of Giovanna and Francesco's bedroom 
   window, waking up Francesco, who goes to the window and sees Licia 
   doing a slow striptease by the pool. He can't take it anymore, so he 
   tiptoes out of the bedroom and down to the pool, but Licia isn't 
   there. He comes inside and goes back to bed, where he sees a naked 
   Licia in bed looking right at him (thanks to her fishing line 
   mirror/bedroom door trick). He gets up, goes to her bedroom and 
   begins to make love to her, but Licia makes enough noise to wake up 
   Giovanna, who follows the moans to Licia's bedroom, seeing her 
   husband in bed with her sister. Giovanna cries, laughs and then cries 
   again, running out to the mansion's second floor balcony and killing 
   herself by taking a dive off the balcony. Marco is now truly alone, 
   Francesco leaving the family in shame after attending his wife's 
   funeral, looking at Marco in disgust when he calls out his name, but 
   Licia isn't done with her father yet. Her next move turns out to be 
   even more deadly. She tells her father that she and Mario are going 
   to get married and he better accept it, he has no choice. She knows 
   that her father will do anything to stop her from marrying a 
   &quot;blackmailing commoner&quot; so he sets up an appointment to 
   talk to Mario and offer him more money not to marry Licia at his home 
   tomorrow. Licia overhears the conversation and her final plan is 
   about to come to fruition.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Licia goes to Mario's house and says she is happy that they are 
   about to get married. They toast to their upcoming nuptuals, but 
   Licia has drugged Mario's glass of champagne and he passes out. Licia 
   places a drugged Mario in bed, tapes her father's pistol to the 
   footboard of the bed and ties fishing line to the trigger and the 
   door. When Marco arrives and opens the door after Mario doesn't 
   answer, the trigger is pulled and Mario is shot directly in the 
   middle of his forehead, killing him instantly. Marco grabs the pistol 
   and then leaves without taking it.&nbsp; A short time later, Licia 
   tells her father that she has the pistol and if he doesn't do exactly 
   as she says, she will give the pistol to the police, his fingerprints 
   being the only ones on the gun. Licia tells him that he will have to 
   spend the rest of his life with her, never knowing when she will 
   change her mind and turn him in to the police. We then see Licia and 
   Marco having dinner together, Licia looking directly at her father 
   and smiling, while Marco tries to ignore her, as their butler (Nerio 
   Bernardi; <B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#Satanik1968">SATANIK</A></B>

    This is one of only three films that star Rossano Brazzi directed 
   (using the pseudonym &quot;Edward Ross&quot; here) during his long 
   career as an actor, the other two being the Christmas matinee

    AFFAIR</A></B> (1968; using his &quot;Edward Ross&quot; pseudonym). 
   Brazzi also co-wrote the screenplay (using his real name) with the 
   help of Diana Crispo (nothing else worth mentioning), Renato Polselli 
   (director/screenwriter of such strange films as <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#VampireBallerina60">THE

    PLAYGIRLS AND THE VAMPIRE</A></B> - 1960). The participation of 
   Poselli and Regnoli helps explain some of the far-out choices Licia 
   makes in this film, including the pool electroshock (giving her 
   sister and husband a taste of what she went through in the asylum), 
   Giovanna's sudden, unexpected suicide (she's the only person in this 
   film with a conscience), her seduction of Francesco and Mario's 
   death. While there is very little graphic violence or nudity on view 
   (when Ms. Larussa is naked, we think we see more than we actually do, 
   thanks to some good camera placements, where body poses or objects 
   block us from seeing the naughty bits), there is really no need for 
   it, as this is Adrienne Larussa's film all the way. She's not only 
   beautiful to look at, but her plan of revenge is well thought-out, 
   giving us sly little smiles<A HREF="psychout_for_murder_1969.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/psychout for murder italy poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   when her actions causes consequences to happen. The American version 
   of this film reshuffles some scenes in this film and opens in a very 
   different way, showing us Licia having a freak-out sequence in the 
   asylum and then visiting her psychiatrist in his asylum office (new 
   footage not in the Italian version, apparently directed by someone 
   called &quot;Ted Kneeland&quot;, who gets a &quot;Co-Director&quot; 
   credit in this version, just below Rossano Brazzi's nom-de-plume), 
   where she explains to him why she is in this place. The entire film 
   proper then plays as a giant flashback sequence, ending in the same 
   way the Italian version did, but since Licia is in the asylum and 
   telling her doctor what exactly happened, it ruins the ending of the 
   film, showing us that it was her father who really won, placing her 
   back into the asylum and labeling her psychotic. Just like nearly 
   every Italian film released in the United States, it had to be edited 
   because audiences wouldn't understand such a downbeat finale, like we 
   were idiots. That's why if two differents versions are offered for a 
   film, always go for the Italian version, as it is as the filmmakers 
   intended it to be seen. Rossano Brazzi's brother, Oscar Brazzi, 
   produced this film and also produced <B><A HREF="frankensteins_castle_of_freaks_1973.htm">FRANKENSTEIN'S
    CASTLE OF FREAKS</A></B> (1973), also starring Rossano. Oscar also

    OF THE DEVIL</A></B> (1971), also starring his brother, before 
   passing away in 1998 (Rossano passed away in 1994). This is a very

   some of the worst films on VHS; films so bad that even Troma would 
   turn their nose up at them. <B>PUNK VACATION</B> fits perfectly into 
   RaeDon's canon of pure crap, but it is crap that's strangely 
   fascinating. A gang of motorcycle-riding punks (both male and female) 
   stop in some podunk California town and kill the father and rape the 
   sister of Lisa (Sandra Bogan), who all run a small caf&eacute;/gas 
   station. Lisa's boyfriend, Deputy Steve Reed (Stephen Fiachi), 
   responds to an alarm at the caf&eacute; and hits one of the punks 
   with his car, sending him to the hospital, along with Lisa's sister, 
   who is now catatonic. Ramrod (Roxanne Rogers), the leader of the 
   punks, refuses to leave this sleepy little burg until they rescue 
   their comrade <A HREF="punk_vacation_1987.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/punk vacation vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="283" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>in
    the hospital, but Lisa is so enraged she tries to stab the 
   hospitalized punk with a pair of scissors, but fails. Steve tells 
   Lisa to leave the punks to him and the police, but she tells him that 
   she'll handle this on her own terms. Lisa grabs a pistol and heads to 
   the punks' temporary hideout, where she tries to capture them but 
   ends up as their prisoner instead. Ramrod, who incredulously changes 
   her appearance to look exactly like Lisa (!), goes into town and 
   enters the hospital, where she unsuccessfully tries to free her 
   handcuffed comrade before barely escaping herself. When Steve 
   realizes that the punks have Lisa, he has Deputy Don (Don Martin) 
   help him try to rescue her. They sneak-up on the barn where the punks 
   are hiding (Steve shoots the punk's lookout with a rifle he has 
   outfitted with a cucumber silencer!) and rescue Lisa, but not before 
   shooting Ramrod in the hand and another punk in the leg. Steve, Don 
   and Lisa (who is only wearing her bra and panties until Don, not 
   Steve, offers her his jacket!) escape into the rocky terrain and, 
   eventually, to town with the punks not far behind (Steve kills 
   another punk on a motorcycle). After burning all their dead in a huge 
   bonfire, Ramrod (shouting &quot;Kill the Pigs!&quot;) leads the rest 
   of the punks on a raid of the town. They cut off the town from 
   outside interference and begin their attack, but the police have 
   formed a posse full of gun nuts, who begin hunting down the punks on 
   the outskirts of town. After a pretty even match between the punks 
   and the police, Lisa ends the ordeal by wounding Ramrod and allowing 
   her and the rest of the punks to leave town. I guess she forgot about 
   her dead father and comatose little sister. She not only turns the 
   other cheek, she totally fails in her role as a vigilante. What a 
   fucking disappointment she turned out to be, not to mention failing 
   to satisfy our taste for bloody revenge.&nbsp; Although competently 
   filmed, one-and-only-time director Stanley Lewis manages to botch 
   nearly every other aspect of the film; hiring hammy amateur actors 
   (Louis Waldron, who portrays Sheriff Virgil, should win some type of 
   bad acting award for over-emoting as a stereotypical Southern hick 
   sheriff); forgetting that action films should at least have a handful 
   of action scenes (there's really none until the anemic finale); and 
   padding the film with unnecessary filler. The screenplay, by Lance 
   Smith and Harvey Richelson, does try to be humorous at times (Ramrod 
   elects one of the punks to be the military leader because he had some 
   ROTC training in high school!) and portrays some of the punks (though 
   not all) as normal teenagers looking to have one final childish fling 
   before becoming and acting like adults, but the majority of the film 
   is just extremely stupid people (both the punks and the townspeople, 
   especially Steve and the cops) doing the most asinine things at the 
   most inopportune times. If you don't mind the stupidity of it all and 
   the almost total lack of bloody violence, <B>PUNK VACATION</B> may 
   scratch that small itch you have for little-seen regional rarities 
   (filmed in and around Santa Monica, California). All others stay 
   away. Also starring Patrick Reynolds, Billy Palmieri, Robert

   (When Helen complains that there's nothing left in life to do without

   tells Helen that she is broke, her bank account overdrawn and the 
   owner of the car she crashed is demanding twelve thousand dollars in 
   restitution. He also hands her a telegram, but Helen tells James to 
   read it. It's from a man named Maurice, who invites Helen to stay at 
   his villa next to the ocean. When James asks Helen who Maurice is, 
   she tells him she was once married to him, but he divorced her three 
   years ago and disappeared, taking all her money with him; this is the 
   first she has heard from him in three years. Helen tells James not to 
   worry, she has no desire to see Maurice ever again and James drives 
   her home, stopping at a liquor store to pick up a bottle of champagne 
   to celebrate her coming home. When James leaves the car to get the 
   champagne, Helen jumps in the driver's seat and takes off. I'll give 
   you one guess where she is going.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When Helen arrives at Maurice's extravagant villa by the sea, she is 
   greeted by a joyous Constance (Anna Proclemer; <B><A HREF="illustrious_corpses_1976.htm">ILLUSTRIOUS
    CORPSES</A></B> - 1976), who introduces herself as Maurice's new 
   wife. Constance is very happy to meet Helen, maybe a little to happy, 
   as she brings Helen to meet her ex-husband. As soon as Helen sees 
   Maurice (Jean Sorel; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#ShortNightDolls1971">SHORT
    NIGHT OF GLASS DOLLS</A></B> - 1971) getting a rubdown by a 
   bikini-clad masseuse, she has a flashback showing us that she tried 
   to once kill Maurice with a pistol, but he managed to grab it out of 
   her hand and then slaps her around. When Maurice sets eyes on Helen 
   for the first time in three years, it is obvious that there is still 
   a spark between them, but is it love or hate? When Maurice gets Helen 
   alone, he tells her that he didn't send the telegram to her, it was 
   Constance who signed his name to it (&quot;Why not? I sign her 
   checks&quot;, says Maurice unapologetically). But why would Constance 
   want to meet Helen and why is she so happy to do so? When Helen takes 
   a shower (full frontal nudity alert and it's obviously not a body 
   double!), both Maurice and Constance watch her from different 
   locations, both of them having lust in their eyes. Constance is a 
   very rich woman, something that Maurice was always drawn to and, as 
   the three go out to dinner, a game of footsie between Maurice and 
   Helen goes on under the table, but when Constance also plays footsie 
   with her (!), Helen pulls her legs away from both of them. Constance 
   then gets a phone call from her daughter Susan and Helen tells 
   Maurice that Constance seems to be too young to have a teenage 
   daughter. He tells her it was a indescretion from Constance's teenage 
   years and she keeps Susan in a boarding school, but she always 
   manages to make Constance angry (Helen hears her yelling at Susan 
   over the phone). When Constance gets Helen alone, we discover why she 
   wanted Helen to come to the villa. I'll give you one guess what that is.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Yes, Constance wants Helen to kill Maurice. She is tired of him 
   spending her money and having affairs with young women. She tells 
   Helen that she has already paid her hospital bills and the twelve 
   grand to the racecar owner and offers her an additional hundred 
   thousand grand to kill Maurice, but it must look like an accident. 
   Constance is well aware that Helen once tried to kill Maurice and 
   thinks that Helen would once again love to kill him, as he made her a 
   pauper, forcing her to become a fashion model and then a racecar 
   drives after he took all her money, divorced her and disappeared. 
   Helen is apprehensive about killing Maurice, so Constance gives her a 
   couple of days to think about it, as she is going to see daughter 
   Susan and will be back in two days. During those two days, Helen 
   tries to leave in her car, but it won't start. It's obvious that 
   Maurice tampered with the car and when Helen discovers the missing 
   car part is in Maurice's jacket, she gets the car running and takes 
   Maurice for the ride of his life, driving fast down a twisty 
   cliffside road (a very good sequence) and stopping the car just 
   before she drives it off the cliff down to the ocean water crashing 
   against it. After having dinner together and then going to a disco 
   (where a really bad band is playing a pop tune), a romance breaks out 
   between the two and they make love (her doctor is going to be very 
   made at her for having sex, but at least she isn't smoking...yet). 
   When Constance returns from her trip to see Susan, Helen tells her 
   that she had sex with Maurice so he wouldn't be suspicious her plans 
   to kill him, saying she is going to shoot Maurice with an air-powered 
   spear gun when all three of them take a boat trip tomorrow. That 
   night, Maurice catches Helen practicing with the speargun, so she 
   hands him the speargun and tells him she bought it for him as a 
   surprise present. The next day, all three of them hop on Maurice's 
   boat and go to a spot in the ocean where the underwater currents are 
   very powerful. As Maurice puts on his wetsuit and is about to jump in 
   the ocean, Helen points the speargun at him, but she doesn't pull the 
   trigger. Constance yells at her to kill him just like they planned, 
   but Maurice grabs the speargun out of Helen's hands and stabs 
   Constance to death with his diving knife, just as Helen and Maurice 
   planned. When Maurice's friends, Dr. Harry Webb (Alberto 
   Dalb&eacute;s; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Left-HandedFate1966">LEFT-HANDED
    FATE</A></B> - 1966) and his wife Solange (Liz Halvorsen; <B><A HREF="mission_stardust_1967.htm">MISSION
    STARDUST</A></B> - 1967) are also on the ocean in another boat and 
   come close to Maurice's boat, he intentionally capsizes it, all three 
   of their bodies being thrown in the water. To make it look real, both 
   Maurice and Helen call out Constance's name, knowing her dead body is 
   being swept away to parts unknown by the heavy underwater currents. 
   Yes, Helen has fallen madly in love with Maurice again and now they 
   both are rich, as Maurice will inherit Constance's vast fortune. Or 
   so he thought. I'll give you one guess who can throw a monkey wrench 
   in his plans.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Maurice's boat is towed back to the harbor, another friend of 
   his, Judge Albert Duchamps (Luis D&aacute;vila; <A HREF="mummys_revenge_1975.htm"><B>THE
    MUMMY'S REVENGE</B></A> - 1975), questions Maurice about Constance's 
   disappearance and why his boat capsized. Henry backs up Maurice's 
   story, saying it's easy for a boat to capsize in the underwater 
   currents if brought aft too fast and Constance probably drowned after 
   getting caught up in them. Both Maurice and Helen see his bloody 
   diving knife on the deck of the boat, so Helen goes on board with 
   Judge Albert, makes some smalltalk and kicks the knife into the 
   water, no one being the wiser. But that's the least of their 
   problems. While Maurice and Helen enjoy a short time of sexual bliss, 
   the unexpected (?) arrival of Constance's daughter Susan (Marina 
   Coffa) turns Helen's life into a living Hell. When Susan hears her 
   mother died in a &quot;terrible accident&quot; from butler Miguel 
   (Manuel D&iacute;az Velasco), she makes sure all her venom is 
   directed towards Helen. Maurice sends his butler on a month-long 
   prepaid vacation so he doesn't tell Susan about his affair with 
   Helen, yet Susan already seems to know about it, even implying Helen 
   killed her mother so she could have her ex-husband to herself. When 
   Maurice discovers that Harry filmed his boat capsizing with his super 
   8mm camera (which is always attached to Harry's hand), he and Helen 
   try to get the processed reel of film as it is delivered to the post 
   office before Harry does, just in case the footage shows Constance 
   dead before the boat capsized. When Helen goes to the post office to 
   see if it has been delivered (it hasn't), Susan is behind her, as if 
   to let her know that she knows what she is doing. While everyone is 
   shooting shotguns at pigeons (!) for target practice, Susan says she 
   is working on writing a murder mystery, where an ex-wife murders her 
   ex-husband's <A HREF="quiet_place_to_kill_1970.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("219","305") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/quiet place to kill dvd front2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="219" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>current
    wife so she can have him all to herself. She says this in front of 
   Judge Albert, who laughs. They then talk about how they have been 
   unable to find Constance's body, so Susan says rather than looking 
   where the currents may have taken her, they should look in the 
   location where the boat capsized (Maurice attached Constance's corpse 
   to the boat's anchor, so her body would sink to the ocean floor, not 
   be taken away by the currents). Judge Albert thinks that is a good 
   idea (That area of the ocean is able to be seen from Maurice's 
   villa), so a boat with nets drags the bottom of the ocean at that 
   area of the ocean and they snag something heavy. Both Maurice and 
   Helen watch nervously as the heavy object is lifted into the boat. It 
   turns out to be a log, but Susan begs the Judge to stop looking for 
   her mother, as it is proving too much for her. Helen grows more and 
   more paranoid due to Susan's constant remarks about her killing 
   Constance and her affair with Maurice, but she really begins to go 
   over the edge when Susan dresses in Constance's clothing, looking 
   exactly like her mother. But the real thing that pushes Helen over 
   the edge is when she catches Susan and Maurice naked and making love. 
   Helen accuses Maurice of having an affair with the teenage girl long 
   before she even met Susan, implying that Constance knew about the 
   affair, which is why Constance sent her daughter to a boarding 
   school. Maurice tells her that is not true, he only got close to 
   Susan at that moment, as he tried to convince Susan that no one 
   killed her mother, it was just an unfortunate accident. When Harry's 
   super 8mm film arrives at the post office, Helen picks it up and 
   hands it to Maurice (who goes in the bathroom to look at it), but 
   Harry arrives at that moment and thanks Maurice for picking up the 
   film for him. Maurice talks Harry into projecting the film for the 
   first time at his villa tonight and Harry agrees. This is where the 
   film takes drastic turns in plot and the safety of one character 
   becomes deadly.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At the projecting of the film, everyone is there, including Susan 
   and Judge Albert (Solange just disappeared from the film after we see 
   her on the boat, Harry explaining that she is away for two days). The 
   projected film shows Maurice cuddling and kissing Constance before 
   the footage switches over to the boat capsizing, although the footage 
   never shows that, only Maurice, Helen and Constance waving to Harry 
   and Solange in their boat, but the footage ends on an image which 
   clearly shows Helen holding up the dead Constance's arm, as if she is 
   waving to Harry and his wife. Helen runs out of the room crying and 
   Harry is certain there was more footage on the reel of film he shot 
   (Maurice may have cut the footage from the reel of film when it took 
   it into the bathroom at the post office). While playing chess at the 
   country club, Maurice tells Judge Albert that he is worried about 
   Helen's nerves and that he is going to invite her to his tower in the 
   morning so they can go on a nice relaxing hike. The next morning, 
   Maurice goes to the tower on his property and pulls out his shotgun, 
   when he hears a car pull up. As Judge Albert passes by the tower in 
   his car at that moment, he hears a shotgun blast and heads 
   immediately to the tower, where he sees Helen and her car driving 
   away quickly. When the Judge searches the tower, he finds the gold 
   monogrammed cigarette lighter that Maurice gave Helen and a trail of 
   blood that leads outside and goes over a cliff to the ocean below. 
   Long story short, the Judge accuses Helen of murdering Maurice 
   (showing Helen her lighter he found at the crime scene), saying that 
   she is not to go anywhere until Maurice's body is found. The Judge 
   posts police outside to make sure Helen doesn't try to escape. Susan 
   admits to Helen it was her that killed Maurice, wearing a blonde wig 
   and looking like Helen in the mirror (the reverse negative mirror 
   scene we saw in the film's opening), which drives Helen even more 
   insane. Susan tells the officer outside that he has a phone call, 
   giving Helen enough time to escape in her car. Maurice then calls the 
   Judge and tells him he is very much alive, but he had an accident 
   with his shotgun and injured his hand, so he went to the hospital. 
   Helen drives way too fast on the same twisty cliffside road that she 
   took Maurice for a ride on earlier and when Maurice appears standing 
   in the middle of the road at the exact point where Helen stopped her 
   car in the nick of time before, Helen this time loses control and the 
   car plunges down the cliff and bursts into flames, killing Helen. 
   Maurice runs back to his car and then arrives at the crash scene 
   shortly after the Judge, Susan and the police do. Susan enters 
   Maurice's car and says their plan has worked, Helen is dead and they 
   can live together in sexual bliss and enjoy her mother's money as a 
   bonus. But wait a minute. A man on a boat from below yells to the 
   Judge that a body has been found in the ocean. Thinking that it's 
   Helen's, the Judge is surprised to see it is Constance's corpse, her 
   body tied in ropes from Maurice's boat with his boat anchor used as a 
   weight to make sure her body stayed on the ocean floor. The Judge 
   then notices the deadly knife wounds in Constance's stomach and the 
   film ends. No one got away with anything.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   desirable than she does here, whether she is naked, wearing a skimpy

   can see why men are crazy about her, because her beauty has an air of 
   innocence, yet she is capable of doing dastardly things. Jean Sorel 
   is more than capable as her ex-husband, still able to make Helen feel 
   loved, even though he made her past life a living hell. His smile and 
   demeanor make him the perfect gigolo, able to get any woman to do 
   what he wants by making them feel special. While the story may seem 
   old hat now, back in 1970 it was quite original and daring, not in 
   the violence department, as there is very little of that here, but in 
   the way Maurice is able to get women to do what he wants, until it 
   turns on him in a way he will never forget. Lenzi shows a sure hand

    A little girl named Kitty is singing to her doll, which she has

   bedroom. Tobias tells Eveline to give the doll back, but Eveline 
   looks at a macabre painting in his room and she says, &quot;Kitty is 
   the Black Queen and I am the Red Queen&quot;. She then grabs a dagger 
   and stabs the doll seven times, screaming &quot;I hate you! I hate 
   you!&quot;, much to the horror of Tobias and Kitty. Eveline then cuts 
   the doll's head off, holds it in the air and laughs maniacally. Kitty 
   tackles her sister and after a short while she calms down. Eveline 
   tells her grandfather that whenever she looks at the painting, &quot;I
    felt something inside me.&quot;&nbsp; Tobias tells the two young 
   sisters the story of the painting: <B>&quot;Many, many years ago, the 
   Red Queen and the Black Queen lived in this castle. They were sisters 
   like you two. They'd hated each other since they were children. The 
   Black Queen silently put up with the Red Queen's wicked schemes, 
   waiting for the time when she could have vengeance. When the Red 
   Queen fell in love with a man, The Black Queen finally got her 
   revenge and murdered her sister one night while she was sleeping. She 
   brutally stabbed her seven times. Legend has it that it that a year 
   after her death the Red Queen came back to life, spreading terror. 
   She murdered six innocent people. The seventh was the Black 
   Queen.&nbsp; At peace once again, the Red Queen returned to her 
   grave, but the same thing happened a hundred years earlier, and a 
   hundred years later, always in this castle and always between two 
   sisters, and it will keep happening every hundred years.&quot;</B> 
   (If you think this was a harsh tale to tell children, think of the 
   Grimm Fairy Tales. They were just as violent, if not moreso.). When 
   Kitty asks when it is going to happen again, Tobias says, 
   &quot;Fourteen years. In 1972 to be precise.&quot; Grandpa then tells 
   his nurse to throw the painting away. So begins this gruesome tale of 
   the macabre.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The police have a drawing of the Red Queen based on eyewitness 
   accounts and Kitty notices that it looks just like Eveline. She 
   wonders how Eveline could have been connected to Hans Meyer. When 
   Kitty gets home there is a message on her answering machine from 
   Eveline, who says she is coming to kill her. Kitty begins to believe 
   that Eveline is alive,&nbsp; so she and Franziska go to the castle's 
   basement cell where they both hid Eveline's dead body. They find 
   blood on the walls (and plenty of bats!), but Eveline's decomposing 
   body is still there. We then find out that Martin is married to a 
   crazy woman named Elizabeth (Carla Mancini; <B><A HREF="violent_professionals_1973.htm">THE
    VIOLENT PROFESSIONALS</A></B> - 1973), who has escaped from her 
   asylum cell. She tells Martin that she is visited by Eveline often in 
   her asylum room and told her that she will kill Martin if she keeps 
   seeing Kitty. The Red Queen then kidnaps Kitty's assistant Lenore 
   (Maria Antonietta Guido), throws her in the back of a van and then 
   stabs her seven times in the torso, her private parts and her legs (3 
   down, 4 to go).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Lulu shows up at Martin's front door, strips naked and says, 
   &quot;Even the police know I'm an incredible nymphomaniac!&quot; They 
   then make love (Who can turn down a naked Sybil Danning???). Martin 
   admires a necklace Lulu is wearing and all she will say about it is, 
   &quot;I only wear it on special occasions. An old friend gave it to 
   me.&quot; Elizabeth shows up in front of Martin's apartment. The Red 
   Queen gives Elizabeth her dagger and when she climbs over a dangerous 
   iron fence, the Red Queen pulls her leg out from underneath her and 
   she impales herself under her chin by the fence's sharp spikes. The 
   Red Queen laughs and drives away in Martin's car. Elizabeth's last 
   words are, &quot;Eveline, Eveline...&quot; (4 down, 3 to go). 
   Inspector Toller begins to look at Martin as a major suspect. The 
   Inspector receives a phone call from a woman telling him to talk to

   closing in on him, so he begs Kitty to tell the Inspector where 
   Eveline is. Kitty finally confesses to Martin that she killed Eveline 
   and in a flashback we discover just how Herbert and Franziska knew 
   about her death. They were both there and helped Kitty cover-up the

    Wonderfully shot, with some fluid, nightmarish visions (the shot of 
   the Red Queen running to Kitty's bed beats anything that Dario 
   Argento has given us) and the mystery element is actually well 
   thought-out and not as outlandish as other giallo films (Screenplay 
   by Miraglia and Fabio Pittorru [<B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#WeekendMurders1970">THE

   close attention to the necklace Lulu is wearing and think of one 
   character whose name is mentioned, but is never seen (it is mentioned 
   in this review). It's hard to believe that Emilio P. Miraglia never 
   directed another film after this (as far as I can discover, he is 
   still alive, but in his early-90s [at the time of this review]). 
   Based on <B><A HREF="night_evelyn_came_out_of_the_grave_1971.htm">EVELYN</A></B>

    The film opens with the body of a young woman wrapped in plastic in 
   the trunk of a car. Someone throws her body off a cliff to the raging 
   river below. Inspector Gianni Di Salvo (Fabio Testi; <B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#Contraband1980">CONTRABAND</A></B> 
   - 1980) is called-in when her nude body is found, her vagina bloody 
   and disfigured. The body is that of Angela Russo and the Inspector 
   calls her mother (Helga Lin&eacute;; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#LoreleysGrasp1973">THE
    LORELEY'S GRASP</A></B> - 1973) to come and identify the body. She 
   brings her very young daughter, Emily (Fausta Avelli; <B><A HREF="#Psychic1977">THE
    PSYCHIC</A></B> - 1977) to the morgue (!) and she seems very 
   troubled. Emily tells the Inspector that her sister belonged to a 
   clique known as &quot;The Inseparables&quot; and that he should talk 
   to Paola (Elke Ohrner) and Virginia (Brigitte Wagner), who were 
   Angela's friends at the all-girls school she was a student at. We are 
   then whisked to the girls locker room, where they strip naked (If 
   they are young girls, I'm a monkey's uncle!), take showers and it 
   reveals that they are not alone, as someone is peeping on them 
   through a hole drilled in a wall. The Inspector questions the 
   school's headmistress, Miss Graham (Mar&iacute;a Asquerino; <B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#HouseInsaneWomen71">HOUSE
    OF INSANE WOMEN</A></B> - 1971) and when he doesn't get the right 
   answers from her, he yells out, &quot;Someone with a cock this big 
   raped Angela Russo and threw her in the river!&quot; It turns out 
   that this school is a hotbed of sex, as we watch Virginia making love 
   to Max van der Weyden (Tony Isbert; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#RestInPieces1987">REST
    IN PIECES</A></B> - 1987) in the school's church. The Inspector 
   finds a drawing of a cat in Angela's diary and when his assistant, 
   Don (Bruno Alessandro), is driving him, he sees the same drawing 
   spray-painted on a billboard (What's the connection?). It seems that 
   little Emily is also playing detective, as she hands a 
   &quot;clue&quot; over to the Inspector. It is a dart that was used to 
   make Virginia's horse bolt. Could someone be trying to kill her? The 
   Inspector rushes to the school, barges into the girls' sleeping 
   quarters and wakes them up. Why does Miss Graham act so suspiciously?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Max is killed when the Yamaha motorcycle he is riding on is forced 
   into the path of an oncoming bus, the killer leaving a note on his 
   body that says: &quot;Run towards the black shadow. Death will come 
   to Legion&quot;. It is signed &quot;Nemesis&quot;. Someone tries to 
   kill the Inspector by setting his trailer on fire, but he escapes. He 
   is having a very bad day, because when he goes to the apartment of 
   his girlfriend Christina (Christine Kaufmann; <B><A HREF="murders_in_the_rue_morgue_1971.htm">MURDERS
    IN THE RUE MORGUE</A></B> - 1971), she says she is leaving him. His 
   superior, Chief Inspector Louis Roccaglio (Ivan Desny; <B><A HREF="who_1974.htm">WHO?</A></B> 
   - 1974) wants the case solved as fast as possible, so the Inspector 
   goes to the home of Michael Parravicini (Jack Taylor; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Wax2014">WAX</A></B> 
   - 2014), a teacher at the school who sleeps with his students. When 
   he shows him the note left on Max's body, Michael gets very nervous. 
   The Inspector also notices that the drawing of the cat is on 
   Michael's Jeep (Hmmmmm...). We then see Virginia getting an abortion, 
   intercut with a flashback she has where she witnesses Angela getting 
   raped with a large dildo at an orgy (This film gets sleazier by the 
   minute, especially the POV shot from Angela's vagina as the dildo is 
   about to enter it!). Someone tries to kill Virginia by putting 
   marbles at the top of a staircase (!) and she falls down the stairs, 
   seriously hurt but not dead. The Inspector goes to the hospital, 
   where Paola wants to talk to him but not at the hospital. The 
   Inspector never gets to talk to her, as she is murdered that night. 
   He talks to Paola's father (Ricardo Merino), but gets nowhere. The 
   Inspector is certain that Michael is the killer, so he takes him on a 
   rollercoaster ride (!), threatening to throw him off if he doesn't 
   confess. All Michael is able to tell the Inspector is that the two 
   dead girls were friends with Max and he is <A HREF="red_rings_of_fear_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/red rings of fear blu-ray front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="264" HEIGHT="308" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>being

   with the schoolgirls. That night, Michael is stabbed in the neck by

   this atypical low-budget thriller, a foursome of masked burglars 
   break into the house of a wealthy jewelry store owner and hold his 
   wife and daughter hostage while three of the burglars drive the owner 
   to his store, where they plan on grabbing a small fortune in diamonds 
   and jewels. While the three burglars are driving to the store with 
   Dad, the lone cackling burglar, Luke (Bob Elliott), begins undressing 
   and feeling-up the tied-up teenage daughter while holding a butcher 
   knife to her throat. Mom kicks Luke in the nuts and then kicks the 
   ski mask off his face, revealing his identity. Luke loses it and 
   viciously slashes Mom's throat and repeatedly stabs her in the chest

    is the granddaughter of a wealthy Senator, so the burglars have hit 
   a double payday. Not only did they get the jewels, they now plan to 
   ransom Jenny to her grandfather for a bundle of money. Alas, they 
   never get the chance to do so. Jenny and Mark, who have never met 
   each other before that night, pretend to be engaged to throw their 
   captors off balance. They overpower and kill one of the burglars when 
   the other three head to town for supplies and grab a shotgun, a .45 
   and a .38. They then steal a pickup truck and head towards 
   civilization, but are immediately spotted by the other three burglars 
   and the chase is on. Mark kills another burglar with a shotgun blast 
   through the windshield, but during the chase, their pickup is 
   disabled, forcing Mark and Jenny to flee into the woods. Luke and the 
   last remaining burglar flank the couple on both ends, wounding Jenny 
   in the leg with a rifle shot. They are recaptured for a short time, 
   but turn the tables on their captors. Jenny shoots the other burglar 
   several times in the back and the rape-happy Luke gets a pitchfork in 
   the gut after he seriously wounds Mark and tries to sexually assault 
   Jenny. Even though they have just met, Mark and Jenny have come to 
   depend on each other and eventually fall in love.&nbsp; Though 
   ultra-low-budget, this regional thriller (lensed in Spring Hill, 
   Missouri) is remarkable for a few reasons. It's well-acted by a cast 
   of unknowns, has an effective music score and contains bursts of 
   eye-opening graphic violence and nudity. Director/screenwriter Bob 
   Bliss (who, as far as I can tell, has never directed another film) 
   manages to tell a compelling story with a meager budget and a cast of 
   non-pros (who also don't seem to have appeared in anything else), 
   which only adds to the film's strange atmosphere. It starts out as a 
   crime drama, turns into a chase actioner and ends as a revenge 
   thriller. While the film is technically sloppy in spots (the editing 
   is choppy and there are some bad camera setups), the overall tone of 
   the proceedings is dark and brooding. You are never sure what is 
   going to happen next, as the film switches gears so often, the viewer 
   is left off-kilter and uncertain what the next scene will bring (I 
   was certain that Mark was a jerk and a gigolo, especially when he 
   comes-on to Jenny in the Laundromat, but he steps up when the 
   situation demands it). Don't get me wrong; this film has no higher 
   aspirations than a cheap thriller, but it's down and dirty, with 
   plenty of violence (bloody bullet squibs, a brutal stabbing, the 
   pitchfork impalement) and two very uncomfortable rape scenes 
   (especially Luke's rape of the daughter in the beginning, as he runs 
   the knife across her body while saying things like, &quot;Sixteen and 
   never been...kissed!&quot;). At it's core, <B><A HREF="scream_for_vengeance_1979b.htm">SCREAM
    FOR VENGEANCE</A></B> tells a simple story rather effectively. If 
   you can get past some of the technical shortcomings and several of 
   the actors' 70's porn-style bushy moustaches, I think you will find 
   yourself liking this. Also starring Walter Atamanuik, R.E. Roudebush 
   and Steve Scearchy as the other burglars. Featuring Leonard Belove,

   MacGrieffs, Lady Mary (Francoise Christophe) and her mentally ill son

   Alicia (Dana Ghia), for a loan, but she refuses, telling Lady Mary 
   that Corringa will soon inherit the family fortune on her rapidlly 
   approaching 18th birthday. The sexually liberated Corringa (who was 
   just expelled from school) accidentally throws her Bible in the 
   roaring fireplace and you know what that means: Something bad is 
   about to happen. At dinner, the mad Lord James insults everyone at 
   the table, forcing Lady Alicia and Corringa to get up and walk out of 
   the room. Family physician Dr. Franz (Anton Diffring), who loves Lady 
   Mary, explains to everyone left at the dinner table, including Father 
   Robinson (Venantino Venantini) and Suzanne (Doris Kunstmann), that 
   when Lord James was a child, he killed his sister and spent some time 
   in an insane asylum. Dr. Franz begs Lady Mary to sell the castle, but 
   she stubbornly refuses. Could <A HREF="seven_deaths_in_the_cats_eyes_1973b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/seven deaths in the cat's eye dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>she
    be hiding something? That night, Lady Alicia is savagely attacked in 
   her bedroom by an unseen gloved assailant and killed, while Corringa 
   finds a hidden passage in her bedroom and is assaulted by the same 
   assailant when she follows the passageway to the castle's basement. 
   The only witness to both crimes was an orange-haired tabby cat and, 
   at Lady Alicia's funeral the next day, Lady Mary orders that the cat 
   be locked-in Lady Alicia's crypt. Lady Mary now hopes that Corringa 
   falls in love with her son, which will in turn infuse the family 
   fortunes and save the castle from foreclosure. This is where things 
   get weird. Corringa discovers that Lord James keeps a live circus 
   gorilla in his artist studio, Dr. Franz is sleeping with Suzanne (who 
   is bisexual) in some plan to gain control of the castle (Corringa's 
   sudden appearance has thrown a monkey [ahem!] wrench into their 
   plans) and the butler, Angus (Luciano Pigozzi, a.k.a. &quot;Alan 
   Collins&quot;), is murdered by the gloved killer when he sets the cat 
   free from the crypt. As more people are killed, the question becomes: 
   Who is the killer and what is his/her motive? Is it possible that the 
   killer is a vampire? Or is it the gorilla? (Wouldn't it be sweet if 
   it were a vampire gorilla?) Alas, it's none of the above, as we find 
   out Lord James may not be mad after all and one member in the castle 
   isn't who they say they are.&nbsp; This French/Italian/German co-production,
    directed by <A HREF="antonio_margheriti_films_on_amazon_prime.htm">Antonio

   - 1964) and the giallo films that became so popular in the 70's. As

    DEATHS IN THE CAT'S EYE</A></B> takes place at a secluded location. 
   Here it is a castle and, like all giallos (gialli?), there is no 
   shortage of suspects. The addition of a gorilla as one of the 
   suspects is indeed offbeat, but it is only used sparingly (a good 
   thing, too, because it's nothing but a man in a cheap gorilla suit) 
   and you know it's only use is as a red herring. It's nice to see 
   Anton Diffring (<B><A HREF="circus_of_horrors_1960.htm">CIRCUS OF HORRORS</A></B> 
   - 1960) playing such a callous character, but he doesn't dub his own 
   voice, so it's a little distracting. The murders on view are 
   restrained for a giallo. While blood splashes on the walls and there 
   are some macabre sights on view (including rats eating a corpse in 
   the beginning of the film, which is an important clue in solving the 
   mystery), we never actually see the murders committed, as they are 
   either filmed in the shadows or the camera moves away before the 
   killer strikes. As with <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#YourViceLockedRoom">YOUR

   faces seem to say, &quot;Will you die already, old man!&quot; These 
   are a family of despicable people, only interested in themselves and 
   no one else, especially daughter Evelyn (Jessica Dublin; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Slasher1972">THE
    SLASHER...IS THE SEX MANIAC!</A></B> - 1972), who can't be bothered 
   being at her dying father's bedside, because she is having sex with

   give their dead uncle a peck on the forehead and leave the room, 
   while Evelyn says to Tony, &quot;More. I'm dying!&quot; At Tomas 
   Hilton's funeral a few hours later, Tony tells niece Susan (Susanna 
   Levi) he knows she was close to her Uncle and regrets the pain she is 
   feeling. He, too, was close to her Uncle and feels the same pain 
   (Sure he does!). On the drive back to town, all the nieces and 
   nephews can think about is their share of the Hilton pie and whether 
   their Uncle's homosexual secretary, Simon Boskin (Gianni Dei; <B><A HREF="total weirdness.htm#PatrickStillLives80">PATRICK
    STILL LIVES</A></B> - 1980), will be mentioned in the will.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Evelyn entering the herbal shop run by her Aunt Ingrid 
   (Annamaria Tornello; <B><A HREF="frankensteins_castle_of_freaks_1973.htm">FRANKENSTEIN'S
    CASTLE OF FREAKS</A></B> - 1973), Thomas's sister, and she says to 
   Evelyn, &quot;Now, only you and I know the Hilton secret.&quot; At 
   the reading of the will a few days later, the Notary&nbsp; (Ferrucio 
   Viotti; <B><A HREF="day_of_anger_1967.htm">DAY OF ANGER</A></B> - 
   1967) reveals that everyone, including Simon (but not Tony), will 
   have equal shares in the Hilton fortune, but only once they reach the 
   age of thirty. If an heir dies before then, their share will be 
   distributed evenly amongst the surviving members. I think I have seen 
   enough &quot;reading of the will&quot; movies to know where this film 
   is heading. It's called murder, but with a twist you will never see 
   coming (Really. You couldn't guess what's coming in a million 
   years!). Nephew Jonny (Giovanni Petrucci; <B><A HREF="shoot_first_ask_questions_later_1975.htm">SHOOT
    FIRST...ASK QUESTIONS LATER</A></B> - 1975) will be the first to 
   turn thirty in one month and five days, but I'm willing to wager he 
   never makes it. Simon tells Susan that her Uncle once told him that 
   someone would destroy the family after his death and that person 
   would be Evelyn. &quot;It appears there's a secret between her and 
   Ingrid&quot;, says Simon. But someone other than Evelyn will murder 
   the Hilton heirs in various ways, trying to wipe out the Hilton name 
   from the history books and by the Hilton family's actions, I can't 
   think of better people to wipe off the map. These are despicable 
   people who only care about sex and other debaucheries, at least most 
   of them are (Susan shows Simon a wound she has had since she was 
   young, telling him it happened when Ingrid was &quot;playing&quot; 
   with her. At this time we don't see the wound, but in order for Simon 
   to see it, Susan has to strip nude.). We then see Jonny at a drug and 
   sex orgy and when he stumbles back to the Hilton castle, someone 
   beats him over the face and head with an ancient iron weapon, turning 
   his face to a bloody pulp and killing him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A Police Inspector (Donald O'Brien; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#Keoma1976">KEOMA</A></B> 
   - 1976) and his assistant (Irio Fantini; <B><A HREF="sicilian_connection_1972.htm">THE
    SICILIAN CONNECTION</A></B> - 1972) arrive at the castle after 
   Evelyn discovers Jonny's body and calls the police. The Inspector 
   says it looks like Jonny was hit with something metal, like a 
   medieval weapon, but the Hilton family say they've never seen a 
   weapon like that in the castle. The Inspector finds two nails from 
   Java (sharp metal fingernails that are slipped over the thumb and 
   index finger) and tells his assistant to find out who purchased them. 
   The Inspector gathers all the Hilton heirs into one room and begins 
   to question them, as Tony watches the ambulance drive away with 
   Jonny's body. The Inspector tells the gathering of Hiltons that the 
   clause in the will is an excellent motive for murder, saying one of 
   them is the murderer and none of them are to leave the castle until 
   he finds out who it is. Tony tells the Inspector that housekeeper 
   Gloria (Marzia Damon; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BloodsuckerDance73">THE
    BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE</A></B> - 1975) was with him all night 
   and Gloria says it is true, Tony has no reason to lie because he 
   wasn't even mentioned in the will. Suddenly, the Inspector no longer 
   believes that the clause in the will was the motive for Jonny's 
   murder, saying it was for another reason he is not sure about yet. It 
   could have something to do with a threatening letter the Notary found 
   addressed to himself in the library this morning (The letter says 
   that Jonny's murder was just a smokescreen), niece Ann (Camille 
   Keaton; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#TragicCeremony1972">TRAGIC CEREMONY</A></B> 
   - 1972) saying she was in the library last night and the letter 
   wasn't there. The Inspector says it couldn't be a stranger who left 
   the note, since the castle hasn't had any visitors, but Susan 
   interrupts, telling the Inspector to find the killer quickly, 
   otherwise this will be &quot;left hanging over us.&quot; She doesn't 
   want that to happen and wants the killer caught. The Inspector asks 
   the Notary if he knows who wrote him that letter and he slyly smiles, 
   gets in his car and drives away. We then see Ingrid pay Evelyn a 
   secret visit outside, where she hands Evelyn a package and says not 
   to worry, it's the same as all the other times. What is it? Simon, 
   who is not as gay as most people believe (We see him having sex with 
   Susan a short while ago), ruminates about Thomas' love of classical 
   music, while the Hilton clan complain to the Inspector that not 
   allowing them to leave the castle grounds is making them feel like 
   prisoners. Susan says, &quot;If you've go nothing concrete, no clues, 
   no evidence, then...&quot; and The Inspector stops her and says, 
   &quot;Then, what? This is murder. I can't have sympathy for any of 
   you, whether I like you or not. My duty is to catch the killer. I'm 
   not keeping you here out of spite. I have a strong feeling the killer 
   is in this room. Here, amongst you!&quot; (The camera pans around the 
   room while the Inspector is saying this and they all look guilty as hell.).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    A young woman named Lucy (Lorenza Guerrieri; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#NakedYouDie">NAKED
    YOU DIE</A></B> - 1968) pays Tony and Gloria a visit and they have a 
   m&eacute;nage a trois. Nephew Edward (Augusto Nobile) and Susan also 
   make love in another bedroom (I guess they are more than kissin' 
   cousins!). It seems the only thing this family has in common is sex. 
   Susan only creates sculptures that have an erotic theme, telling the 
   Inspector that she only sculpts what she knows.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    As night approaches, we see the Assistant Inspector sleeping on a 
   chair in the hallway where Jonny was killed and we can see the nails 
   from Java are missing from their case (Susan put them on her fingers 
   earlier in the day, but she put them back). We then see a strange man 
   (Sergio Ferrero; <B><A HREF="barbarella_1968.htm">BARBARELLA</A></B> 
   - 1968), someone we have never seen before, entering Ann's bedroom 
   wearing the nails from Java. He climbs on Ann and proceeds to slice 
   her breasts and chest with the nails, but she likes it! The next 
   morning, the Inspector finds the ancient weapon that killed Jonny 
   hidden in a hole in the castle's outer stone wall. We then see that 
   one of the Hilton women is a drug addict, as we watch a pair of 
   female hands reach into a secret compartment and pull out her 
   &quot;works&quot; and using a syringe to inject a drug into her veins 
   (It shouldn't be too hard to figure out who it is). Ann's brother Nat 
   (Maurizio Tanfani; an Assistant Director on <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#OtherHell">THE
    OTHER HELL</A></B> - 1980) pays her a visit at the castle and tells 
   her that he's glad that Jonny is dead; he knows Ann was in love with 
   him, but he was never right for her, saying this about Jonny's death: 
   &quot;Deep down, he deserved it.&quot; When the Inspector hears this, 
   he arrests Nat on suspicion of murder, but is he really responsible? 
   And who is this strange man terrorizing everyone at the castle? He 
   knows all the castle's secret passageways, using them to get to his 
   victims and to escape. Think you <A HREF="sex_of_the_witch_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sex of the witch italy poster4a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>know

   (1975) and the Nazisploitation flick <B><A HREF="holocaust_2_1980.htm">HOLOCAUST
    2</A></B> (1980), plays a major trick on the audience by changing 
   the film from a giallo to a supernatural horror film during the last 
   ten minutes. It will either infuriate you or come as quite a jolt. 
   The giallo fanatic in me wanted to hate the film, but the finale is 
   so unusual and unexpected, I couldn't help but admire its chutzpa. 
   Ninety percent of this film plays out like a standard giallo flick, 
   but the final few minutes come straight out of the supernatural when 
   we finally discover who the strange man really is. Right after 
   discovering the man's identity, we see Tony and Gloria checking the 
   rooms in the castle, revealing the surprise fates of the Hilton 
   family members. Throwing a monkey wrench into the film's final 
   minutes should have made me want to kick in my TV screen, but I must 
   say that the final three minutes did tickle my fancy. This is nothing 
   spectacular, but it is diverting enough for at least one viewing, 
   thanks to the plentiful nudity and the way the film quickly switches 
   gears during the final minutes. I was wondering if the title would 
   live up it its name and it did. Giving Pannaccio some uncredited help 
   with the screenplay was Franco Brocani, who is better known for being 
   Second Assistant Director on <B><A HREF="gangsters_law_1969.htm">GANGSTER'S

   (1970), which, if you haven't seen it, I recommend you do because it 
   is braindead fun. Pannaccio went on to close out his career by

   anyone to climb) and a broken glass on the bathroom floor. Andrew 
   tells Carla that no one is there and it was probably the wind that 
   knocked down the glass. Carla thanks Andrew for coming so quick and 
   then goes back to sleep.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next morning, with Fred once again away on business, Carla goes 
   to the front desk and asks Andrew if she knows anyone who can give 
   her a tour of Miami, as she has never been to this city before. 
   Andrew says he knows the perfect person, him, so he ditches his 
   responsibilities as a house dick and takes her to all the best 
   tourist attractions, including the Miama Seaquarium, where Carla 
   meets and feeds Flipper (!) and then to the Everglades National Park, 
   where Andrew takes her on an airboat ride (Man, that looks fun!). 
   Andrew forgot he was supposed to take Marta out to dinner that night 
   and when he comes back to the hotel at night with Carla in tow, he 
   doesn't notice that Marta is in the lobby waiting for him. Marta 
   leaves in a huff and when Willy (Lorenzo Robledo; <B><A HREF="night_of_the_walking_dead_1975.htm">NIGHT
    OF THE WALKING DEAD</A></B> - 1975) at the Front Desk tells Andrew 
   that Marta was waiting for him for quite a while and just left, 
   Andrew realizes the mistake he made, tries phoning Marta, but she 
   keeps on hanging up on him, so the next morning he buys some flowers 
   and goes to her home, where her understanding father, psychiatrist 
   Dr. MacGregor (Francisco Piquer; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Sound Of Horror">SOUND
    OF HORROR</A></B> - 1964), tells Andrew he will have to work on how 
   he treats his daughter, but he's on Andrew's side. Marta doesn't want 
   to hear Andrew's excuses, telling him she saw him with Carla, but 
   Andrew tries to explain to her that there's no romance between him 
   and Carla, he was simply giving her a tour of Miami (he is telling 
   the truth). Marta doesn't believe him, so Andrew storms out of the 
   house, telling Marta it is over between them for good this time. It's not.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">Andrew
    knows something is wrong with Carla, especially earlier, when she 
   dropped her purse and the contents spilled all over the floor. Andrew 
   helps her pick up the items, but he pockets a bottle of harmless 
   over-the-counter pills, which will be important to uncovering the 
   truth. Long story short, Carla tells her husband about being shown 
   around town by Andrew (she also tells him about the bathroom 
   incident) and he gets angry, telling her not to talk to him again. He 
   begins spying with binoculars on Carla at the pool and sees her once 
   again talking to a concerned Andrew, who is sure something is wrong 
   with her, but she won't tell him what is wrong. To avoid Carla from 
   seeing Andrew further, Fred rents a beachhouse for them to live in 
   while in Miami, hiring a maid, Ursula (Mar&iacute;a Mun&eacute;), to 
   give Carla peace of mind. Marta and Andrew end up burying the 
   hatchet, but when Marta complains on not being able to sleep, Andrew 
   pulls out the pills he took from Carla. After her father assures 
   Marta that these pills are harmless, she takes a couple and soon 
   begins freaking out, much to the surprise of her father and Andrew. 
   Dr. MacGregor tastes one of the pills and tells Andrew that these 
   pills are pure LSD. Is Carla aware she is taking LSD? If not, who is 
   giving them to her? Andrew is determined to find out.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    In a twist everybody saw coming, it turns out Nick is not dead. He 
   is working in conjunction with Fred on an experiment to change Carla 
   (it really doesn't make much sense at all!). Flashbacks show us that 
   Carla was a bikini-clad go-go dancer (but not topless) at a New York 
   City discotheque and her manager/wannabe pimp Nick, notices that 
   Frederick was very interested in her, so he convinces Carla to 
   romance and marry him. Nick then comes up with a plan to kill 
   Frederick in a burglary gone wrong so Carla can inherit all of his 
   money and share it with him. He hands Carla the gun, assures her it 
   is loaded with blanks and tells her to pull the trigger. This is 
   where the beginning of the film happens, as Carla thinks she has 
   murdered Nick, but he was faking all along, working with Frederick 
   from the beginning to change Carla's personality (what???) for a 
   handsome sum of money. Turns out it was Nick all along haunting 
   Carla, but now Nick wants his money immediately so he can leave Miami 
   and live a good life. Can Andrew, Dr. MacGregor and, yes, even Marta, 
   save Carla in time, or will she fall victim to Frederick's dastardly 
   plan (whatever it is)?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    pretty well-worn Spain/Italy co-production has a Giallo plot that is 
   so standard, a child could write it, but it does have a few redeeming 
   moments. Tony Kendall looks like he is having the time of his life in 
   Miami, piloting an airboat like a pro and smiling throughout the 
   majority of the film, like he was enjoying his time there. The 
   photography (by Giuseppe Alberti, in his only cinematographer effort, 
   although he handled First Assistant Camera duties on such films as <B><A HREF="ten_foot_pole_steven_jackson.htm#HerHarem1967">HER
    HAREM</A></B> [1967] and&nbsp; Mario Bava's <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Rabid Dogs">RABID
    DOGS</A></B> [1974] &amp; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#Shock1977">SHOCK</A></B> 
   [1977]) does offer a few surprises, such as Marta's freak-out scene, 
   a nostalgic look back to late-'60s Times Square in NYC, some 
   beautiful Miami travelogue footage and a few rather good POV shots. 
   The music soundtrack, by Carlo Savina (<B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CryptOfVampire1964">CRYPT
    OF THE VAMPIRE</A></B> and <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#CastleLivDead1964">CASTLE
    OF THE LIVING DEAD</A></B> [both 1964]) is better than it has any 
   right to be, especially when Carla discovers the dead body of Ursula 
   in her closet (something that makes Fred very angry, as he didn't 
   want anyone to die from his experiment, which leads to bad blood 
   between him and Nick, resulting in one of their deaths). 
   Director/screenwriter Luis Marquina had been directing films since 
   1935 (he passed away in 1980) and this seems to be his only genre 
   effort (he did co-write the screenplay to <B><A HREF="mr_superinvisible_1970.htm">MR.
    SUPERINVISIBLE</A></B> - 1970), so that's some explanation as to why 
   the plot here is so clich&eacute;d. There's no nudity and very little 
   blood (besides the opening shots) in this film, shot in 1968 and not 
   released until 1972 (thanks to Spain's dictator, Francisco Franco, 
   voicing displeasure with the way it portrayed women [it turns out 
   Carla was not as innocent as she seemed, as she was all-in for the 
   murder part of Nick's plot!]) but if you are in the right frame of 
   mind, you may find yourself enjoying it for what it is: a TV 
   Movie-like detective plot with hardly anything having to be excised 
   to be aired uncut. It's still a rare film, though, but not every rare 
   film can be an absolute winner. Sometimes they are rare for a reason. 
   It's not awful, just ordinary.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   (Farley Granger; <B><A HREF="#Amuck1971">AMUCK</A></B> - 1971) is put 
   in charge of finding the unknown killer, but he will have to tread 
   lightly because, if he doesn't, the &quot;important&quot; citizens in 
   this town could get him fired. The killer also leaves intimate photos 
   next to the bodies of his naked female victims, with the man in the 
   photos having his face scratched out with a razor blade. Inspector 
   Capuana believes that the man in the photos is that of the killer, 
   but he has to prove it to his superiors. We then watch the killer 
   (who refers to himself as &quot;The Avenger&quot;) as he stalks his 
   latest victim, a young housewife named Serena (Femi Benussi; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#StripNudeKiller">STRIP
    NUDE FOR YOUR KILLER</A></B> - 1975). When she meets her lover in a 
   park, we watch the killer snap photos of them together, like some 
   psychotic private investigator. She takes her lover to her beach 
   house and, when he leaves, the killer strikes. He is wearing a long 
   black overcoat, black gloves, large black hat and a black stocking 
   over his face to obscure his identity (he looks just like the killer 
   in Mario Bava's proto-slasher <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#BloodBlackLace1964">BLOOD
    AND BLACK LACE</A></B> - 1964). He chases Serena to the beach, where

   sequence filmed in slow-motion).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Rossi</A>; <B><A HREF="contraband_1980.htm">CONTRABAND</A></B> -

   Serena's corpse, &quot;You're much prettier than when you were

   Avram; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#BayOfBlood1971">A BAY OF BLOOD</A></B> 
   - 1971), who also acts suspiciously and tells Inspector Capuana that 
   the killer is probably impotant or a homosexual (WTF?!?). We also 
   meet several other men and women who could be the killer (giallo 
   films are not biased about the sex of a killer), including Franca 
   (Annabella Incontrera; <B><A HREF="#CrimesBlackCat">CRIMES OF THE

   lawyer Paolo Santangeli (Silvano Tranquilli; <B><A HREF="legend_of_blood_castle_1972.htm">THE

   unfaithful Renata getting killed by The Avenger in her bathroom while 
   waiting for her lover, Gianni (Andrea Scotti), to arrive. The killer 
   slices Renata's throat and stabs her in the vagina (!) before Gianni 
   confronts the killer (It is at this time that we get a close look of 
   the face behind the black stocking). The killer slices Gianni's hand 
   and gets away. When Barbara learns her best friend was killed, she 
   implores her husband to quit the police force, but he refuses, 
   telling her that he loves his job. Gastone confesses to the Inspector 
   that he is the killer, but is <A HREF="so_sweet_so_dead_1972.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/so sweet so dead poster small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>he?
    I'll never tell, because I never give the killer's identity away in 
   any giallo film I review, but I always leave enough clues for you, 
   the reader, to play detective. I will tell you this: The Inspector 
   gets a phone call from the killer, which he records. After listening 
   to the tape several times, he realizes that Barbara is cheating on 
   him. The Inspector sets up a trap with his wife as bait, but instead 
   of saving her, he lets the Avenger kill her (That will teach her for 
   cheating on him!) and once the killer is through, Inspector Capuana

    even though it is sold under the review title). The film contains 
   some ingenious sequences, including the previously mentioned beach 
   killing scene and the shot of pussy willows hiding Lilly's vagina 
   when she gets out of bed after having sex with her lover (How's that 
   for symbolism?). There's also a scene where Barbara and her 
   girlfriends get nude massages. What does this have to do with the 
   plot, you may ask? Nothing really. I just mentioned it because it was 
   hot. This film gained some notoriety back in the day (1976), when 
   William Mishkin (whose company distributed this film) hired Straw 
   Weisman (the director of <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Deadmate">DEADMATE</A></B>

    When the late Farley Granger (who was gay in real-life) found out he 
   was starring in a porno film, he threatened legal action, which 
   forced Mishkin to pull the film from porno theaters in the U.S. (it 
   continued to play across Europe). Directed deftly by Roberto Bianchi

   everyone, with the Inspector and Sam close behind him, when he 
   notices that the bridge is washed out, the raging river rising 
   quickly. Spike pulls over to the side of the road and the Inspector 
   uses his car to block his way. They exit out of the car, their guns 
   drawn, Spike raising his hands above his head. Spike then tries to 
   escape, knocking Sam to the ground and pulling out a switchblade, but 
   a knife is no match for the Inspector's gun, so he gives up, the 
   Inspector calling him a &quot;stinking murderer&quot;. When everyone

   use the phone, but Joe doesn't want to let anyone in, so the 
   Inspector uses his position to make him open the door, which Joe 
   does. Dr. Williams wants to use the phone first, saying that he was 
   on his way to the hospital to perform an emergency operation, but the 
   Inspector says his business is more important. The Inspector calls 
   his station, but as he is about to tell them his location, the phone 
   goes dead. The Inspector tells everyone that they must stay at the 
   house for the night, because all the roads are flooded, which doesn't 
   please Joe but, once again, the Inspector uses his position to get 
   Joe to change his mind. We then discover why Joe has taken this 
   stance: He has his unnamed girlfriend (Giulia Rovai) staying in a 
   bedroom and tells her not to leave the room or make herself known to 
   anyone else.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Once everyone gets settled in, Spike starts to play the piano and 
   Sylvia stands there enthralled, daydreaming that she is making love 
   to Spike while holding a bloody switchblade in her hand. The 
   Inspector orders Spike to stop tickling the ivories and handcuffs 
   him, Sylvia asking Spike what it feels like to kill a person, pissing 
   off the Inspector. Spike gives her a long, elegant speech on what it 
   means to take a life, which then pisses off Donald. Joe then tells 
   everyone that this house actually belongs to the estate of Sheila 
   Marlow, who died last year in a &quot;mysterious, tragic death&quot;, 
   according to Professor Lawrence. The Professor then tells everyone

    Joe says that Sheila held many seances before her mysterious death 
   and shows them the table where she held her seances. Sylvia wants 
   everyone to hold a seance to contact Sheila, telling them that Donald 
   is an excellent medium, but he wants nothing to do with it. Sylvia, 
   the Professor, Dr. Williams and Susan hold a seance to contact 
   Sheila, where everyone at the table twitch like epileptics and Donald 
   becomes possessed by the spirit of Sheila, talking in her voice. 
   &quot;It's dark! Give me a voice, give me a face!&quot; says the 
   possessed Donald and, suddenly, the wind blows open the doors, Donald 
   laughing like a maniac. Dr. Williams is forced to slap Donald about 
   his face to snap him out of his trance. But there is a more serious 
   problem: Spike has escaped, knocking out Sam and running outside. The 
   storm has stopped, so the Inspector and Sam go outside to look for 
   Spike and soon find him, Spike saying he couldn't go any further 
   because water has surrounded the house, making it impossible for him 
   (or anyone) to leave. We then discover that Dr. Williams and Susan 
   met the Professor just hours earlier. They picked him up at the side 
   of the road, the Professor telling them that his car had broken down

    The biggest problem with this film is it can't make up its mind 
   which genre it belongs in. This was director/screenwriter Mario 
   Colucci last directorial effort. He was assistant director on the 
   horror film <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Playgirls&amp;Vampire60">THE 
   PLAYGIRLS AND THE VAMPIRE</A></B> (1960) and then directed mostly 
   forgettable films, including the spaghetti western <B><A HREF="revenge_for_revenge_1968.htm">REVENGE
    FOR REVENGE</A></B> (1968). While this film has some fine, moody 
   cinematography (by Giuseppe Aquari; <B><A HREF="#KillerReserved9Seat">THE
    KILLER RESERVED NINE SEATS</A></B> - 1974), it really doesn't 
   matter, because the film is all over the place, mixing haunted house 
   themes (the camera floats to the ceiling to convey Sheila's spirit), 
   with hamfisted crime and mystery elements, making this strange stew 
   indigestible. It just doesn't work here, although the cast of 
   seasoned pros give it the old college try, but even they can't hide 
   the film's creaky plot. Case in point is Donald's death, as he sits 
   in a chair, a bullet in his chest. He rambles on and on, talking in 
   riddles, trying to get us to believe something supernatural is going 
   on, but it doesn't wash, as it feels unnecessary and false (and 
   spirits don't shoot bullets!). The whole film feels false and doesn't 
   contain an ounce of believability. We don't give a damn what happens 
   to anyone here, as they are all worthless pawns in a losing chess game..</FONT></FONT><BR>

    While there is some female nudity, especially by Joe's nameless 
   girlfriend, it, too, seems forced, as it was inserted into the film 
   to get our minds off the absurdities of the plot. Mario 
   Colucci's&nbsp; screenplay is as bland as his direction. Filmed as <B><A HREF="something_creeping_in_the_dark_1971_foreign_ads.htm">QUALCOSA
    STRISCIA NEL BUIO</A></B> (&quot;Something Creeping In The 
   Night&quot;), this film obtained a U.S. theatrical release 
   (distributed by Joseph Green Pictures), but I can find no legitimate 
   U.S. VHS or disc release. I purchased this film on DVD-R through 
   Amazon from an outfit called <A HREF="http://www.roguevideodvd.com">Rogue
    Video</A>. Imagine my surprise to discover that the disc was in 
   anamorphic widescreen and the print used looked flawless, without one 
   single emulsion scratch or speck of dust or dirt. I may just have to 
   purchase more little-known films from them if they look and sound 
   like this one. I just wish the film itself was better, but that is 
   not the fault of Rogue Video. <B>Not Rated</B>, but there is no 
   graphic violence on view, another reason why this film is such a 
   bore. The cop-out finale gives us no explanation if anything 
   supernatural is happening, ending with the Professor saying, 
   &quot;It's not for us to know, only to believe or disbelieve.&quot;, 
   as the camera pans to a photo of Sheila and we then hear a woman 
   laughing. Need I go on?</FONT></FONT></P>

   Swedish director Peter Borg follows-up his weird horror film <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#ScorchedHeat">SCORCHED
    HEAT</A></B> (1987) with this, a supernatural murder mystery 
   involving ghost children, personal demons and death (and, thankfully, 
   no Simon &amp; Garfunkel on the soundtrack). Struggling American 
   photographer Peter Mitchell (Peter Nelson) learns from lawyer Larry 
   Haughton (Troy Donahue; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Blood Nasty">BLOOD
    NASTY</A></B> - 1989; in a quick booze money cameo) that he's 
   inherited a house in Sweden when his spinster relative, Annie Holst 
   (Elsa Gastrin), died in her sleep. Never knowing that he had such a 
   relative, Peter still hops on a plane with novelist fianc&eacute;e 
   Sarah (Kristen Jensen) and her deaf son Dennis (Dennis Castillo) and 
   heads to Sweden. They are met at the Swedish airport by lawyer Thomas 
   Hansen (Rico Ronnback), who hands Peter the keys to the house and 
   written directions on how to get there, but otherwise mysteriously 
   avoids answering any of Peter's other q<A HREF="sounds_of_silence_1989.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sounds of silence vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="302" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>uestions.
    Of course, Peter manages to get lost on the drive, but whenever he 
   asks the locals where the &quot;Annie Holst House&quot; is, he is met 
   with cold, quiet stares. Peter eventually finds the house, which 
   turns out to be a forty-room mansion, but it is Dennis who 
   immediately senses something is wrong here. Annie's housekeeper, 
   Margaret Johnson (Vanja Rodefeldt), tells them the story of Annie's 
   illegitimate son Bill (Jonas Iversson), who was put in a nearby 
   orphanage (Annie couldn't bear the shame of having other people know 
   she had a child out of wedlock), but died with all the other orphans 
   in some catastrophic incident when he was a young boy. Annie loved 
   her son, even after he died, so she and Margaret would make weekly 
   walks to the deserted orphanage to talk and hug Bill's ghost. Bill 
   begins appearing to Dennis, leading him to the orphanage and slowly 
   giving Dennis clues as to really what happened that fateful night. 
   Dennis also has nightmares about a creepy kid and a ghastly-looking 
   man carrying a cane, but they may not be nightmares at all (Dennis 
   wakes up the following morning with muddy feet, like he's been 
   walking in his sleep). The deaf Dennis convinces Peter that Bill is 
   real, but Peter cannot see him (Maybe the photos he has taken will 
   prove Dennis correct?). As Dennis and Peter get closer to the truth, 
   it becomes apparent that some people involved in the catastrophe are 
   still very much alive and would rather not have the truth uncovered. 
   A visit from lawyer Thomas and Sarah nearly getting raped by plumber 
   Frank (Johnny Harborg) leads Peter, Dennis, Sarah and Thomas to the 
   home of elderly Charles (Gunnar Ohlund), who Dennis instantly 
   recognizes as the older version of the man with the cane that haunts 
   his dreams. It turns out that Charles was in charge of the orphanage 
   during the deaths of the children and Dennis believes that he is a 
   murderer. After Thomas is killed by Frank, Dennis and the ghost 
   orphans have a final showdown with Charles and Frank in the unmarked 
   graveyard next to the orphanage. The final score: <B>Ghost Children:</B> 
   2. <B>Bad Guys:</B> 1.&nbsp; As far as supernatural thrillers go, <B><A HREF="sounds_of_silence_1989b.htm">SOUNDS
    OF SILENCE</A></B> delivers it's fair share of shivers (especially 
   when the ghostly children appear), but the mystery angle is way too 
   easy to figure out since the cast of living suspects is very small. 
   Director Peter Borg, who co-wrote the script with Marc Fiorini, fills 
   the screen with creepy, fog-shrouded visuals and the use of a deaf 
   kid as a conduit for ghostly revenge is a novel idea, but the film is 
   so lackluster in nearly all other departments, including acting (at 
   least the main actors here don't speak Swenglish, that odd 
   combination of Swedish/English that permeated Borg's <B>SCORCHED HEAT</B>)
    and the storyline (Sarah is a poor excuse for a mother, as she 
   doesn't believe a word her son tells her in sign language. Truth be 
   told, Dennis would be lucky to have Peter as his step-father, even 
   though he doesn't understand sign language at all.), that it moves at 
   a snail's pace (At 105 minutes, the film runs at least 20 minutes too 
   long). The lack of any substantial blood or violence (just a hand 
   being cut with a knife and the after-effects of Thomas getting hit on 
   the head with a sledgehammer) will also turn-off those looking for 
   more than a simple ghost story. There are some scares to be had here, 
   but only for those that can look past the shortcomings. At least the 
   deaf Dennis doesn't miraculously get his hearing back in the finale. 
   That's something, anyway. Proceed at your own risk. Also starring 
   Bruno Desire, Hasse Andersson and Peter Borg as Young Charles.

    a female body lying on the beach. After being led to believe it's

   out. Before she can explain to Christian why she is on the beach, she 
   disappears, but leaves behind a thermos with the word 
   &quot;Tucania&quot; printed on it. Christian is instantly smitten 
   with Barbara and traces the thermos to a yacht named Tucania, owned 
   by the mysterious Alex (Mario Erpichini). At a party on the yacht, 
   Christian hooks-up with Barbara (after he callously ditches his 
   girlfriend), but a hired killer named Tatum (Adolfo Lastretti) is 
   watching the boat. Barbara brings Christian to a motel for some 
   mattress dancing, but she makes him shave his beard first (She says, 
   &quot;I'm very suspicious of men with beards.&quot;). While he is in 
   the bathroom shaving, Tatum appears and there's a struggle for his 
   gun. Christian shoots Tatum in the stomach and he and Barbara are 
   about to split when Alex arrives. All three of them go back to the 
   yacht when Christian realizes that he left his necklace in the motel 
   bathroom (he removed it when he was shaving). He goes back to 
   retrieve the necklace only to find Tatum's body missing. Christian 
   and Barbara hide out in an empty seaside mansion, only to discover 
   that they are not alone. After finding a bloody pair of pruning 
   shears, they discover that the mansion is occupied by strange couple 
   Malcolm (Guido Alberti) and Clorinda (Monica Monet). Soon, Christian

    mysterious past?&nbsp; This maddening mystery is all over the map, 
   with scattershot acting (Robert Hoffman and Suzy Kendall make for 
   stiff leading actors) and a script that bites off more than it can 
   chew (there a way too many subplots to keep track of), but 
   director/co-scipter Umberto Lenzi (<B><A HREF="action.htm#Almost Human">ALMOST
    HUMAN</A></B> - 1974; <B><A HREF="action.htm#RomeArmedTeeth">ROME 
   ARMED TO THE TEETH</A></B> - 1976) manages to throw in some 
   perversity and a lot of weird visuals to keep you watching till the 
   end. The sight of numerous female dolls strewn about town, tied to 
   trees with legs or arms missing, is an eerie sight and the importance 
   of their discovery isn't made clear until the film is nearly over. 
   And it's a doozy. While most of the film turns out to be nothing but 
   your standard &quot;Drive your brother crazy so you can inherit your 
   father's business&quot; scenario, there are some good points to this 
   film, including an evocative Ennio Morricone score, some decent 
   deaths (including a nasty death-by-car scene) and some atmospheric 
   camerawork, but, surprisingly, very little blood. A sequence I found 
   utterly ridiculous was the home movie that Ivan Rassimov (<B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Humanoid1979">THE
    HUMANOID</A></B> - 1979) watches towards the end of the film. It's 
   so tightly edited and well-shot, it's hard to believe that it was 
   shot by anyone who didn't have a masters in editing and 
   cinematography. The film also contains almost no nudity, unless you 
   count the exposed breasts on the latex dolls. The lack of blood and 
   nudity was done purposely by Lenzi (who reveals in an interview on 
   the DVD that Lucio Fulci was originally slated to direct, but dropped 
   out to make another film), who wanted this film to be more 
   psychological and show the &quot;darkness of the human soul.&quot; <B><A HREF="spasmo_1974c.htm">SPASMO</A></B> 
   is nothing exceptional, but it is diverting enough to keep you 
   entertained for 93 minutes. Too bad that the leads are so damn stiff 
   and boring, though. Also starring Maria Pia Conte, Luigi Antonio 
   Guerra and Rosita Tirosh. This did get a U.S. theatrical release in 
   the mid-70's (with a lurid and misleading ad campaign), with an extra 
   ten minutes of gory footage (shot by George A. Romero, of all 
   people!) to beef-up the death scenes. Umberto Lenzi calls this extra 
   footage &quot;reprehensible&quot; in the interview on the DVD. Be

   are lovers and when she drops dead at the party of an apparent

    Tony meets a cadre of potential suspects, all who attended Louise's 
   funeral. Julie Foster (Tisa Farrow; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Anthropophagus1980">ANTHROPOPHAGUS</A></B> 
   - 1980), a blind student at the college who was Louise's best friend, 
   tells Tony that his sister was very troubled the last few weeks of 
   her life, but she doesn't know why. Tony searches Louise's apartment 
   and finds some photos that pique his interest. Tony believes his 
   sister was murdered, so he has a talk with her ex-boyfriend, Fred 
   (Dave Nichols), who tells him about and argument he saw between 
   Louise and Dr. Tracer. When the autopsy results come back and Tony 
   discovers that his sister was poisoned, he confronts Dr. Tracer, who 
   tells Tony he did not murder Louise and he can prove that he gave her 
   a stimulant during her fake overdose, as those pills are still in his 
   medical bag. He retrieves the bag and opens it, but the pills are not 
   there. Dr. Tracer begs Tony to ask Margie Cohn (Gayle Hunnicutt; <B><A HREF="legend_of_hell_house_1973.htm">LEGEND
    OF HELL HOUSE</A></B> - 1973), as she saw him giving Louise the 
   pills at the party. Sgt. Matthews did background checks at everyone 
   at Louise's funeral and tells Tony that Margie is known to sleep 
   around. Sure enough,&nbsp; when Tony goes to question Margie, he 
   finds her sleeping with Robert. She backs up Dr. Tracer's claim about 
   the pills, but she will not swear to it in a court of law.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Meanwhile, we watch some unknown killer murdering a woman by bashing 
   her head in over and over with a metal pipe and dumping her body at a 
   construction site. It turns out the victim wasn't a woman at all, but 
   rather a transvestite who happened to be Margie's brother. Tony and 
   Sgt. Matthews go to arrest Dr. Tracer, but he has his lawyer waiting 
   for them at his house. That doesn't deter Tony, who slaps the cuffs 
   on the doctor and brings him to the station. Sgt. Mathews does an 
   extensive background check on Dr. Tracer and finds a photo of Louise 
   wearing a necklace that is familiar to Tony, but he can't place 
   it...yet. After learning about Margie's brother's death, Tony 
   searches for some transvestites that can clue him in on what the 
   brother was up to before his death. He finds two of them, one who 
   beats the snot out of Tony, sending him through a balcony window. 
   Tony finally gets the upper hand, sending the tranny through the 
   other balcony window and shoving a hot curling iron up the ass of the 
   other tranny (!). One of the trannies has a key to a locker at a bus 
   station and when Tony goes to open it, he is attacked by two men, who 
   turn out to be detectives who were surveilling the locker. When Tony 
   opens the locker, he finds the necklace. Julie tells Tony that his 
   sister gave her a necklace a day before she died. Tony then talks to 
   a dwarf stoolie at a racetrack and chases a suspect into a crowded 
   public bathroom, where he does what all good detectives do: kick-in a 
   stall door (interrupting a priest taking a crap!) and shoving the 
   suspect's head into a sink full of water when he refuses to talk (at 
   least it was a toilet bowl!). This leads to the car chase I talked 
   about at the beginning of the review.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    This film brought a flood of memories back to me since it was one of 
   the films that played endlessly on HBO during its early years.

   his frequent &quot;Martin Herbert&quot; pseudonym,&nbsp; films this 
   like a giallo film, as we don't know who the killer is, there are 
   plenty of red herrings and deaths, as well as some funny dialogue. 
   When the blind Julie says she heard a certain person kill Margie, 
   Tony and Sgt. Matthews find that person dead, hanging from his neck. 
   Sgt. Matthew turns to Tony and says, &quot;Maybe Julie can identify 
   him!&quot; Besides that one line of dialogue, John Saxon is wasted 
   here in a thankless role. The screenplay, by &quot;Vincent Mann&quot; 
   (Vincenzo Mannino; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#HouseEdgePark1979">HOUSE

   hard to figure out who the killer really is.&nbsp; Half the fun of 
   watching this film are the events that lead up to the reveal, such as 
   the tranny fight (which was heavily edited for its TV showings) and 
   the excellent car chase. This is Stuart Whitman's film all the way. I 
   was surprised to learn that Whitman was still alive (he turned 90 in 
   February 2018), as I haven't seen him in anything for years. He's 
   quite good here, as are the supporting cast, especially the late

    We watch famous author Peter Neal (Anthony Franciosa; <B><A HREF="horror r - z.htm#WebSpider1971">WEB
    OF THE SPIDER</A></B> - 1971) bicycling to Kennedy Airport while his 
   chauffeur follows him in a limousine (Anyone who lives in New York 
   City knows that it is impossible to bike to the airport, especially 
   the way Peter does it!). Once at the airport, the chauffeur hands 
   Peter his overhead bag and he waits to board a flight to Rome. Before 
   he boards the plane, Peter gets a phone call, so he places his 
   overhead bag on the floor and takes the call at the front desk. It's 
   a phone call from his former lover, Jane (Veronica Lario), and Peter 
   is quite perturbed and hangs up the phone. During this time, we see a 
   woman looking at Peter's unattended bag and when Peter gets back, he 
   notices that the bag has been moved, but thinks nothing of it. We see 
   the woman knocking on the glass of a phone booth and Jane steps out 
   of it, looking intensely at Peter but not making her presence known. 
   Was something put in Peter's bag to be smuggled out of the States or 
   is it something more ominous? (Remember, this was two decades before 
   9-11 changed the way we fly.).</FONT></FONT><BR>

   Elsa has been arrested twelve times for shoplifting. Elsa uses her 
   female charms to convince the manager to let her go and she goes 
   home, where she is accosted by a dentally challenged vagrant before 
   she can get to her front door. She breaks free and runs inside, 
   trying to make a phone call, but the line is dead. With the vagrant 
   pounding on her glass door, we see someone wearing black gloves 
   holding a straight razor to Elsa's throat, while ripping pages out of 
   Peter's book and stuffing them in Elsa's mouth. The killer then 
   slashes Elsa about the face, chest and throat, killing her, the 
   vagrant seeing the killing through a clear part of the frosted glass 
   door and running away. And then the killer takes her photo, snapping 
   away with a camera.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Peter arrives at the Rome airport, where he is met by his agent, 
   Bullmer (John Saxon; <B><A HREF="horror a - c.htm#Cannibal Apoc">CANNIBAL
    APOCALYPSE</A></B> - 1980), and a throng of reporters. At a hotel 
   suite, Peter is holding court to that throng of reporters, where we 
   learn that Peter's book has been number one on the bestseller list in 
   Italy for twelve weeks. Peter is particularly unnerved when reporter 
   friend Tilde (Mirella D'Angelo; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Maya1988">MAYA</A></B> 
   - 1988) asks him why he thinks so little of women (&quot;Tenebrae is 
   a sexist novel!&quot;), because all the women in his book meet 
   violent deaths. Peter has known Tilde for over ten years and is 
   surprised by her question, telling her it is just a book and not to 
   judge a man by what he writes (He jokingly says to her, &quot;Would 
   it help if I told you I voted for the Equal Rights Amendment?&quot;). 
   Bullmer can see that the room is about to become contentious, so he 
   pulls Peter out of the room and calls off the rest of the interviews. 
   Peter notices a thin man in the room who is staring at him and 
   Bullmer tells him that's Christiano Berti (John Steiner; <B><A HREF="#PlotOfFear1976">PLOT
    OF FEAR</A></B> - 1976), a reporter for a major Italian TV station 
   and not to worry because &quot;He's a big fan of your work.&quot; 
   Peter's personal secretary, Anne (Daria Nicolodi; Argento's <B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#DeepRed1975">DEEP
    RED</A></B> - 1975), has made sure that Peter is comfortable in Rome 
   and Bullmer has a surprise for Peter. He has hired a young man named 
   Gianni (Christian Borromeo; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#HouseEdgePark1979">HOUSE
    ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK</A></B> - 1979) to look after Peter, telling 
   him that one day he will become a world-class agent in Italy. Peter 
   tells Anne that he bought her a gift, but when he opens his bag and 
   pulls it out, he finds the expensive watch he has purchased has been 
   smashed into pieces. I guess we now know what happened to his bag 
   back at Kennedy airport, but who shoved an envelope under Peter's 
   hotel door and what is in it?</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When Peter enters his hotel room with Anne and Gianni, he is 
   surprised to find Rome Homicide Inspector Germani (Giuliano Gemma; <B><A HREF="westerns_all_italia.htm#TexLordDeep1985">TEX
    AND THE LORD OF THE DEEP</A></B> - 1985) and his female partner, 
   Inspector Altieri (Carola Stagnaro; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Phantom Death">THE
    PHANTOM OF DEATH</A></B> - 1987), waiting to talk to him. Inspector 
   Germani asks Peter if he knew Elsa Manni and he says no, this is his 
   first time in Rome. Peter is taken aback by the questions the 
   Inspector and his partner are asking him, especially when a photo of 
   Elsa's dead bloody body is thrust in his face. Peter then asks the 
   Inspector, &quot;If someone was killed with a Smith &amp; Wesson 
   revolver, do you go and interview the president of Smith &amp; 
   Wesson?&quot; (It's a fair question). The Inspector tells Peter that 
   he has read all of his books except for Tenebrae, which he has just 
   started reading, but someone told him that in his latest book, a 
   woman is killed with a straight razor, just like Elsa was. It's just 
   too much of a coincidence to overlook. The Inspector hands Peter an 
   envelope, telling him he found it on the floor when he opened his 
   hotel room door and the envelope is addressed to him. Peter opens the 
   envelope and inside it is a note that reads, &quot;There's only one 
   answer to the fury that tortured him&quot;, written like a ransom 
   note, with letters and words taken from newspapers and magazines. 
   It's a passage from Peter's book, but what does it mean? The 
   Inspector tells Peter he doubts this is the only letter he will get 
   from the killer, so he should inform him immediately when he gets 
   another one. While the Inspector and his partner are still in the 
   room, Peter gets a phone call from the killer, who talks in a 
   whisper, sounding like a woman. The killer tells Peter that this will 
   not be the only victim, because his book is forcing the killer to 
   commit murder. The Inspector listens to the call on another phone and 
   is able to discern that it is coming from a phone booth just outside 
   of the hotel, but when he and his partner get there, it is empty. We 
   then watch the killer having some kind of fit, taking a couple of 
   pills and having a strange flashback, where a topless woman 
   (transsexual actress Eva Robins; <B><A HREF="hercules_1983.htm">HERCULES</A></B> 
   - 1983) and a group of young men are on a beach. One of the young men 
   tries to run away, but the other men tackle him to the ground and the 
   woman steps on his face with one of her red high heel shoes, the heel 
   going inside his mouth.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    We then see one of Argento's patented &quot;one take, no edits&quot; 
   (actually 2 &#189; minutes long) tracking shots of the camera 
   traveling up and down Tilde's two-floor house, as the killer slices 
   Tilde's throat and then attacks and kills her lesbian lover (Ippolita 
   Santarelli), her head going through a pane of glass in slow motion 
   (another Argento trademark). Just before Tilde's throat is cut, we 
   can hear the killer say, Pervert! Filthy slimy pervert!&quot; in the 
   whisper-like female voice. Another note is slid under Peter's door 
   and it is written in Latin and translates to, &quot;So passes the 
   glory of Lesbos.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Just before Peter appears on Christiano Berti's afternoon TV show, 
   he talks to Christiano, who seems more interested in the aberrant 
   behavior of the characters in the book rather than the actual story, 
   but he talks to Christiano and he drops the subject on the TV show, 
   sticking to just the story itself. When leaving the TV studio, Peter 
   thinks he sees his former lover Jane, but Anne says it couldn't be 
   her, she's in New York. Peter is sure it was her and wonders if she 
   was responsible for destroying the watch in his luggage. It becomes 
   apparent that anyone, man or woman, who knows Peter, could be the 
   killer because, while Peter may be cheery on the outside, he has some 
   dark baggage far more dangerous than a broken watch.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Another recent acquaintance of Peter, Maria (Lara Wendel; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#Ghosthouse 1987">GHOSTHOUSE</A></B> 
   - 1987) is attacked by a dog, forcing her to take refuge in a house 
   she has never been to before. Maria finds all the killer's death 
   photos on a table and then goes to call the police, but the killer 
   stops her, whispering &quot;Spy!&quot; and chasing her outside, where 
   she is butchered with an axe. The killer slides another note under 
   Peter's door, this note saying that all perverts need to be 
   eliminated and when they are, the &quot;Corruptor&quot; (Peter) will 
   be next. Peter believes Christiano used the same phrasing when he 
   talked to him just before appearing on his TV show. Anne then sees 
   Jane outside the hotel, but she ignores Anne and drives away. Peter 
   gets a great idea for a new book and it involves trapping Christiano 
   with Gianni's help without any interference by the police. Gianni 
   witnesses the killer planting an axe in Christiano's head and runs to 
   Peter, who has been hit on the head and is almost unconscious. Gianni 
   didn't see the killer's face, but tells Peter that Christiano knew 
   the killer. So who is the killer? I have given you more than enough 
   clues to figure it out on your own, but if you need more information, 
   I'll tell you this: If you think there is only one killer, you are 
   wrong, or as Sherlock Holmes (actually Arthur Conan Doyle) once said: 
   &quot;When you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however 
   improbable, must be the truth.&quot;</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This may be Dario Argento's most accessible giallo film. While there 
   is plenty of graphic violence (including Gianni getting whacked on 
   the top of his head with an axe) and quite a bit of nudity, it's the 
   mystery that takes center stage. The fakeout ending really works 
   here, once you realize that the killer is straight-up batshit crazy 
   and is only pretending to be sane. Jane's death is the highlight of 
   the film, as the killer chops off her right arm at the elbow from 
   outside a window and her stump sprays bright red blood on a nice 
   white wall. It should also be noted that the film is purposely 
   drained of color, except for the murders, which are bright and nasty. 
   The film switches from drained to full color during the finale when 
   the killer dies a really brutal death. Once you see the sharp metal 
   spikes on a sculpture in Jane's rented home, you just know it will be 
   used in the grand finale. The music score, by Claudio Simonetti, 
   Massimo Morante and Fabio Pignatelli (listed as &quot;Simonetti-Morante-Pignatelli&quot;
    in the credits; Simonetti and Pignatelli being members of 
   &quot;Goblin&quot;) is also excellent, setting a mood of dread for 
   the long tracking shot of Tilde's house that works remarkably well. 
   The late <A HREF="giuliano_gemma_amazon_films.htm">Giuliano Gemma</A>,

    on the job and is a fan of mystery novels, so much so, that he tells 
   Peter that he knew who the killer was in his latest book before he 
   got to page 30.&nbsp; This knowledge helps him to identify the real 
   killer but, unfortunately, it doesn't spare his life (that fakeout 
   ending I was talking about). This film is so full of standout 
   sequences that it is difficult to pick a favorite, but the scene 
   towards the end of the film, where Bullmer is sitting on a concrete 
   bench in the middle of the EUR (&quot;Esposizione Universale 
   Roma&quot;, a residential and business district in Rome that is used 
   in many Italian genre films), watching the lives of people as the 
   camera does a 360&#176; pan around him, is definitely one of my 
   favorites, if only for how it concludes. Bullmer sees people 
   fighting, lovers kissing and a little boy playing with a rubber ball, 
   bringing a smile to his face. Unfortunately, it will be Bullmer's 
   final smile, as the killer approaches him and stabs him viciously 
   with a large knife, in full view of all the people he was smiling at.

    This chopped-up version, missing over ten minutes of footage, 
   shortens or eliminates most of the nudity and violence (editing 
   Jane's death so badly, you really have no idea how she dies; even the

   unwatchable. This version was also released on VHS from Fox Hills

    FROM ALCATRAZ</A></B> - 1979, which gets name-checked here) in this 
   fictional horror thriller. Years have passed since his escape (and 
   the closing of Alcatraz as a prison) and Frank is a bitter and 
   violent man (he puts a cigarette out on girlfriend Mona's breast for 
   removing a newspaper from his suitcase!) who needs to return to 
   Alcatraz to retrieve a key that opens a safety deposit box full of 
   stolen loot. After killing a former Alcatraz guard who use to torture 
   him (he slits his throat with a straight razor and then impales him 
   on a piece of wood), Frank hops on a boat as part of a sightseeing 
   tour of Alcatraz. One member of the tour group, Greg (Scott Ryder), 
   an avowed Alcatraz expert, recognizes Frank, but no one else believes 
   him. Franks stays on Alcatraz while the other tourists embark back to 
   port. A group of young tourists<A HREF="terror_on_alcatraz_1986.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/terror on alcatraz vhs front small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="229" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A> 
   decide to sneak back on to Alcatraz to check out Greg's claim, which 
   pisses off Frank, since he's been planning this caper for years. He 
   then proceeds to kill the tourists and Park Rangers, so he leaves no 
   witnesses. Since Greg knows the most about the island, he becomes the 
   unofficial leader of the group, but he proves more stupid than 
   knowledgable. Frank plants a meat cleaver in the face of Kenneth 
   (Gary Gorman) as he's tooting on some cocaine. He then kills a female 
   Park Ranger by drowning her in a vat of water. Greg proves to be a 
   complete idiot as he tries to talk Frank into letting him live. Frank 
   repays him by splitting his head in two with the meat cleaver. After 
   killing another Ranger by disembowelment (off-screen) and taking his 
   uniform and hanging (off-screen) tourist Dean (Peter Kienaas), last 
   remaining Terry (Lisa Ramirez) and Clarissa (Alisa Wilson) run for 
   their lives as Frank snaps the neck of Matthew (Peter Rodriguez), a 
   militant Indian. Frank kills everyone but Terry (the police blame 
   Indian Matthew for all the murders and don't believe Terry's story 
   about Frank), finds the key and sets out to retrieve his loot. In a 
   finale that seems to never end, Frank meets a surprising demise in 
   the bank vault, when someone related to his past gives him his 
   comeuppance.&nbsp; This film works better as a brochure for Alcatraz 
   tourism than it does as a thriller. It takes over 45 minutes to set 
   up the plot (and character quirks) before the first tourist murder 
   takes place. Until then, the film plays like an actual tourist 
   documentary, as the on-location photography and tour guide narration 
   by Ranger Emily (Veronica Porche Ali)&nbsp; and Greg takes up much of 
   the screen time. When the murders finally kick in, it's really no big 
   deal, as the deaths aren't that original and only a couple are 
   bloody. Aldo Ray skulks around the prison in an overcoat and fedora, 
   looking like some third-rate Mickey Spillane (and did we really need 
   to see his overweight hairy man-boobs as he walks around shirtless in 
   the beginning and end of the film?) and screaming his lines (&quot;I'm
    gonna kill YOU!&quot;) like a madman without a cause. I'm sure if 
   the real Frank Morris were alive, he would take offense to this. I 
   like to think this film was made to piss him off and make him come 
   out of hiding. It didn't work. It's a pretty mild film, marred by 
   weak acting (even Ray, in a rare end-of-career starring role, is 
   pretty one-note), lame effects (the bloodiest effect is the last shot 
   of the film) and a finale that never ends. It takes 20 minutes after 
   leaving Alcatraz for Ray to get to the bank vault. First he goes out 
   to dinner with girlfriend Mona (Sandy Brooke), complains about his 
   steak and refuses to pay the bill! I wonder what director Philip 
   Marcus (<B><A HREF="kandyland_1987.htm">KANDYLAND</A></B> - 1987) was 
   trying to achieve here? It's part horror, part thriller and part

   glorified cameo) to help him. Dr. Johnson tells H.J. to stay close to 
   Tommy, because he could snap out of his condition at any moment. 
   During Mr. Kool's funeral, Tommy breaks free of H.J. and his friends 
   and is almost icepicked by the unseen killer (H.J. says to Mr. Kool's 
   widow, &quot;He was really a together brother.&quot; to which she

   police (including the black officers) look down on H.J. and his gang 
   (One black officer says to H.J., &quot;He believed in you and look 
   where it got him.&quot;), so H.J. does his own investigation into Mr. 
   Kool's death. He and his gang go to the Spanish part of town to talk 
   to gang leader Vega (Richard Yniguez) and ask him to help steal some 
   files pertaining to Mr. Kool's arrests out of the police station. 
   Vega and H.J. stage a fake rumble between their gangs as a diversion 
   to pull the police out of the station so H.J. and Vega can enter the 
   station and steal the files. Once he has his hands on the arrest 
   records, H.J. doles out names of recently released felons that may 
   have had a grudge against Mr. Kool for his friends to track down. 
   Their investigations lead them to whorehouses, run-down tenement 
   buildings, a poolhall (where they get the shit kicked out of them for 
   asking questions) and other places kids have no places being in. They 
   strike out with everyone on the list, until they find out that a 
   psychotic baby kidnapper (and homosexual) named Billy Most (Lincoln 
   Kilpatrick, who also starred in <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#ChosenSurvivors">CHOSEN

   he had a definite grudge against Mr. Kool. When Billy Most discovers 
   H.J.'s investigation, he knifes and kills H.J.'s girlfriend and then 
   goes after Tommy. H.J. nearly shoots Billy Most, but Tommy suddenly 
   breaks his silence and calls out his name, stopping H.J. from 
   becoming what Mr. Kool preached against: Becoming a criminal.&nbsp; 
   Although this film gets called a blaxploitation film in many

   by filming on locations that are bleak and colorless, hiring a group 
   of non-pros that makes up most of the cast (making most of the 
   interplay seem loose and natural) and making the violence suspenseful 
   without being too graphic. Mr. Kool's death is shocking, as the 
   killer pumps a full clip into his body and then strips him down to 
   his underwear, just to add insult to injury. The final third falls 
   apart once we find out who the killer is and his motivation for 
   killing Mr. Kool is revealed (it's a little too melodramatic for my 
   taste and doesn't fit in with the realism of the rest of the film), 
   but <B><A HREF="together_brothers_1974b.htm">TOGETHER BROTHERS</A></B> 
   is a fine, little-seen thriller from the mid-70's that holds your 
   interest throughout. This is an adult film about how kids can do the 
   right thing, sometimes doing it the wrong way, but doing it with the 
   best intentions. Although this film is rated PG, it's definitely not 
   made for younger kids, as it is full of foul language, adult 
   situations and violence. This was made during the time when a PG 
   rating didn't automatically mean dumbed-down kiddie fare. I miss 
   those days. Also starring Nelson Sims, Kenneth Bell, Owen Pace, Kim 
   Dorsey and Craig Campfield as Maria, the ugliest, hairy-chested 
   transvestite you will ever see. Since this is the 70's, he pays for 
   his transvestism with his life. This film has never been legally 
   available on home video in the United States, probably because 20th 
   Century Fox (who released this to theaters) didn't want to pay for 
   the music of the two Barry White (and the Love Unlimited Orchestra) 
   songs that are on the soundtrack. Maybe that will change in the 
   future, now that Mr. White is no longer with us. The gray market DVD 
   (on the Blax label) has a decent fullscreen print, along with a 
   couple of trailers (one has the <A HREF="http://www.somethingweird.com">Something

   masks striking poses for director David (Francois-Eric Gendron; <B><A HREF="deadly_games_1989.htm">DEADLY
    GAMES</A></B> - 1989), who is shooting a fashion video. David is 
   particularly enamored with model Sylvia O'Neal (Gioia Maria Scola; <B><A HREF="fantasy.htm#Raiders Of Atlantis">RAIDERS
    OF ATLANTIS</A></B> - 1983), so he tells her lecherous agent, Alex 
   Conti (Giovanni Tamberi; <B><A HREF="short reviews n-z.htm#Specters1987">SPECTERS</A></B> 
   - 1987), that he wants Sylvia to appear in a music video for the song 
   &quot;Blades&quot; that he is shooting on Monday. Alex says no 
   problem, she will be there. We soon find out that Alex is pimping out 
   his models, as he shows a video of his models to an old man named 
   Ajice (Carlo Carli; <B><A HREF="thriller.htm#Tormentor1972">TORMENTOR</A></B> 
   - 1972), who tells Alex that he wants Sylvia for Sunday night. Alex 
   tells him that's impossible, Sylvia is saving herself for marriage, 
   he could get a hundred girls like her for him, but the man is 
   adamant, ordering Alex to make sure she is there on Sunday night 
   (It's quite obvious that Ajice has something on Alex, as he obliges 
   quickly to his demand). When Sunday night comes, we see Alex in his 
   opulent home (where he is playing an 8-bit pornographic video game on 
   his computer!) and Sylvia is upstairs in a hot tub with three other 
   models. Suddenly, Ajice appears behind Sylvia, grabs her and rapes 
   her in the hot tub, the other three models, Leslie (Norhanna 
   Arrifin), Michelle (Helena Jesus) and Lauren (Randi Ingerman; <B><A HREF="desperate_crimes_1993.htm">DESPERATE
    CRIMES</A></B> - 1993), holding Sylvia's legs apart while Ajice 
   rapes her, telling Sylvia to relax and just enjoy it, they, too, have 
   made &quot;love&quot; to this man, it's just business as usual when 
   working for Alex. When Ajice is finished with her, Sylvia comes 
   running down the stairs, furious at Alex for allowing such a man to 
   take her virginity. She then steals Alex's car (Hey, he stole her 
   virginity!) and drives off (after hitting a security guard on his 
   bicycle), Alex yelling at her that she will never work in this town 
   again. His words are very prophetic.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next morning, at the &quot;Blades&quot; video shoot, Alex tells 
   David that Sylvia is not here, he has been unable to get in contact 
   with her all morning. David is distressed she is not there, so he 
   begins shooting the music video with Alex's three other models. While 
   Alex is watching the shoot, he is approached by Police Lieutenant 
   Randan (Francois Marthouret), who tells Alex that his car was 
   discovered in a ditch on fire and a body was found in the driver's 
   seat, but the body was so badly burned that it is impossible to make 
   identification. Alex tells him that Sylvia O'Neal &quot;borrowed&quot;
    his car last night around 1:00 AM, but he fails to mention o the 
   Lieutenant why she took the car, telling him a blatant lie instead. 
   The Lieutenant finds it odd that a passing motorist saw his car 
   explode at 4:00 AM...just ten kilometers from Alex's home, wondering 
   what Sylvia did in those three hours and why she was so close to his 
   house.&nbsp; Alex is quick on his feet, telling the Lieutenant that 
   Sylvia was probably on her way back to return the car. The Lieutenant 
   tells Alex he is probably right (but we can see he doesn't believe 
   him) and then talks to David, admiring the unusual blades that he is 
   using as props on the shoot. David tells him he had the props 
   department fashion the blades specifically for this music video, also 
   telling him that he was not at Alex's house last night, he just 
   returned from London this morning.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    The next day, Alex and his models visit David's house and discover 
   his entire home is computerized (an '80s version of Amazon's Alexa, 
   as it were). David tells Alex he refuses to shoot any more of the 
   music video until he finds a replacement for Sylvia, she was 
   &quot;special&quot; and it will be hard to find someone that has her 
   look and presence. David, along with Alex and his three models, go to 
   a club, where David spots pretty young Melanie Roberts (Florence 
   Guerin; <B><A HREF="bizarre_1987.htm">BIZARRE</A></B> - 1987) dancing 
   provocatively in a very short skirt to some German industrial music.

    Meanwhile, the forensics team examines pieces the skull found in 
   Alex's car and, with the help of a computer program, discovers a hole 
   in the right temple caused by a .22 caliber bullet. Since no gun was 
   found in or around the burning car, the Lieutenant can come to no 
   other conclusion that it was murder, not a suicide. While all this is 
   happening, Melanie tells Leslie that she need a place to stay, the 
   hotel she is at is not up to her standards. Leslie tells her she can 
   come live with her (Sylvia was her former roommate). They become fast 
   friends and do everything together. One night, Leslie has a bad 
   nightmare and Melanie hears her scream out Sylvia's name. Melanie 
   asks her why she screamed out Sylvia's name and Leslie says she is 
   mistaken, her nightmare wasn't about Sylvia (even though we could see 
   it was). Why is she lying?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   a pod that looks like a futuristic version of an iron maiden (or 
   &quot;Virgin of Nuremberg&quot;). When David yells, &quot;Cut!&quot; 
   and tells them to take Leslie out of the pod before she suffocates, 
   they open the pod and Leslie falls to the ground dead, her throat 
   impaled and bleeding profusely. When the Lieutenant and forensics 
   team get to the crime scene, they discover that someone has replaced 
   one of the rubber spikes from the inside of the pod with a metal one, 
   it impaling Leslie's throat and killing her. The Lieutenant asks 
   David who has access to the set and he tells him that anyone could 
   have done it, as they are no guards at night at this studio, so 
   anyone could have pulled the switch (Melanie and David begin a sexual 
   relationship shortly after Leslie's murder).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Ajice phones Alex and accuses him of setting him up for murder, as 
   the police want to question him and demands he come over to his house 
   to discuss the matter. The next day, we discover in a front-page 
   newspaper article that Ajice was murdered, butchered like a hog. 
   Michelle sees Ajice's photo in the newspaper and phones Alex from the 
   studio, who tells her that he went over to Ajice's house last night, 
   but he wouldn't answer his doorbell or phone, saying that he must 
   have been already dead. Michelle tells him she believes someone wants 
   to kill everyone who was at his house Sunday night. As she is talking 
   to Alex, the killer enters the studio carrying one of the prop blades 
   (even though they are props, they are well-balanced and very sharp). 
   The killer chases Michelle through the studio and onto the catwalks 
   above the stage, impaling the blade into her stomach. Michelle falls 
   off the catwalk and plunges to the stage below, dead as a doornail.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Lauren sees a TV news story on Michelle's death and phones Alex, 
   telling him she wants to go to the police and tell them everything 
   because she doesn't want to die. Alex tells her not to be stupid, 
   they could get charged with prostitution, rape and even tax evasion 
   (?), warning her not to go to the cops. Alex tells her he has an idea 
   and needs to check some information at the office, but first he has 
   to shake the two detectives the Lieutenant put on his tail. He tells 
   Lauren to sit tight, relax, wait for his call and not to open her 
   door for anyone, especially if it is someone she knows (Lauren calls 
   Alex a &quot;bastard&quot; and hangs up the phone). Alex loses the 
   two cops following him by exiting out the back door of a coffee shop 
   (the Lieutenant calls them &quot;shit brains&quot;) and then goes to 
   his office, where he makes an important discovery. Lauren gets a 
   phone call from the killer, who plays a recording of Sylvia's voice, 
   so she gets scared and runs out of her house, hops in her car and 
   speeds off, losing the two cops following her. Alex goes to the 
   studio and phone the killer, leaving a blackmail message on the 
   answering machine, but the killer is in the studio and slashes Alex 
   in the back with the prop blade (Alex looks at the killer and says, 
   &quot;It can't be!&quot;). Alex tries to run away, but the killer 
   thrusts the blade through a glass door into Alex's stomach, but he 
   does something with a flash mounted on a tripod that manages to take 
   a photo of the killer before he dies. Lauren arrives at the studio 
   and finds Alex dead, sitting in a director's chair. Lauren then 
   drives to David's house and says she needs someone to talk to, 
   telling him everything that happened on that Sunday night. David then 
   leaves, telling Lauren to make herself comfortable until he returns. 
   David goes to the morgue and asks the guard if he can see Sylvia's 
   coffin. He finds some fresh flowers on top of her coffin (they are 
   still wet) and asks the guard who put them there. The guard tells him 
   he saw no one in the morgue since he has been there, only him. Lauren 
   finds a pocketbook in David's house, revealing that the owner of the 
   purse is actually Sylvia's sister (That may seem like I am giving 
   away the killer's identity, but am I really?).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    When the Lieutenant arrives at the studio and the scene of Alex's 
   murder, he discovers the photo Alex left that seemingly shows the 
   image of the killer. He races over to David's house, where the killer 
   is chasing Lauren through David's high-tech home. Think you know who 
   it is? (Hint: Both the killer and Sylvia are from the same town in 
   New York: Poughkeepsie). As always, the clues to unmask the killer 
   are in this review, but it doesn't take a genius to know who it is, 
   as there are not many people left. Happy hunting.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   helped by the fact that the women are very beautiful. There are also 
   some white-knuckle scenes of suspense throughout the film, especially 
   the conclusion, where the killer is finally unmasked (literally!). 
   This is my favorite film in the &quot;Sexy Model Giallo&quot; 
   sub-genre for those facts alone. It's really not much of a mystery, 
   but it is well-filmed (by Alan Jones; <B><A HREF="bullseye_1990.htm">BULLSEYE!</A></B> 
   - 1990) with a music score (by Roberto Cacciapaglia) that sounds like 
   a <B><A HREF="psycho_1960.htm">PSYCHO</A></B> (1960) riff, with songs 
   by Frankie Goes To Hollywood (&quot;Warriors Of The Wasteland&quot;), 
   Toto (&quot;I Won't Hold You Back&quot;) and Huey Lewis &amp; The 
   News (&quot;Perfect World&quot;) also heard on the soundtrack. Yes, 
   this is an '80s thriller, but that's not a bad thing here. I believe 
   it works because it revels in '80s excess, from drug use, music, 
   fashions, hairstyles and attitude. Anyone who lived back then are 
   bound to enjoy this film, as it will be a nostalgic trip back to a 
   time where all we thought about were ourselves (the &quot;Me 
   Generation&quot;). That may sound harsh, but that's just the way it 
   was back then, a time in our history that is best forgotten, but 
   looked on with both fondness and fury (at least it was by me, but I 
   would rather not talk about it!). This film is a perfect reminder of 
   those times and therefore gets a big thumbs-up from this reviewer.</FONT></FONT><BR>

   black hat and black gloves killing a woman in her apartment. Just as 
   she is about to see his face, the telescope goes black, needing 
   another coin. She misses seeing his face, but gets the address of the 
   apartment by the building's number (57) and notices a chestnut vendor 
   and a customer near the murder scene. Susan and Alberto go to the 
   police and talk to Inspector Merughi (George Martin; <B><A HREF="three_supermen_in_the_jungle_1970.htm">THREE
    SUPERMEN IN THE JUNGLE</A></B> - 1970), but he has a problem 
   believing her since she cannot identify the killer and all she has is 
   a building number and not an actual address. Alberto, who performs an 
   art show where he stabs mannequins (!), shows some photos that Kitty 
   took of his show to TV and film scorer Marco (Sim&oacute;n Andreu; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#Night Of Sorcerers">NIGHT
    OF THE SORCERERS</A></B> - 1973) in hopes that he will use them ion

   &quot;It's the only thing she does well, besides making love.&quot; !).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Kitty calls her friend, newspaper reporter Lidia (Anuska Borova), in 
   hope of finding out who was killed, but Lidia tells her that no body 
   has been found yet (The first time we see Lidia, she is naked and 
   trying to make love to Marco, but he is not able to &quot;rise&quot; 
   to the occasion. When Kitty asks if she has heard the news, she says, 
   &quot;Dear Marco is impotent, how about that?&quot; !!!) The 
   Inspector pays Kitty and Alberto a visit in their apartment, telling 
   them that the have found the body of a female dancer, so Kitty 
   retells him the story and says that the killer wore a black hat, just 
   like the one Alberto owns (Why does Alberto look and act guilty all 
   the time?).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see the killer, who walks with a cane, pick out his favorite 
   straight razor and knock on the door of Rocco, the chestnut vendor 
   (Gualtiero Rispoli). When he answers the door, no one is there. He 
   hears something outside his window, so he opens it and the killer 
   grabs him around the neck with the curved handle of the cane and then 
   slashes his throat with the razor. Lidia arrives at the murder scene 
   and tells the Inspector that this may be the work of a sex maniac 
   (WTF?!?). The forensics team find cane imprints in the soil outside 
   the vendor's window, the same cane prints that were at the scenes of 
   two other murders, including the dancer's (The Inspector turns to his 
   assistant Lolli [Rodolfo Lolli] and says, &quot;Give me the files on 
   all deviants and sex offenders with leg disabilities.&quot; Double WTF?!?!?!?).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see someone sneaking into Kitty's bedroom, pulling the 
   covers off her sleeping naked body and taking photos of her. It is 
   then revealed to be Alberto, who is in the habit of taking naked 
   photos of his girlfriend without her permission. The inspector 
   suspects Alberto is the killer because, the last time he saw him, he 
   was walking with a limp. Alberto tells him that he sprained his 
   ankle, but his reason is very suspicious, especially when the 
   Inspector shows Alberto a photo of him with the dead dancer at a 
   performance art show he enacted a couple of months earlier. Alberto 
   explains that he always gets drunk at his shows and doesn't remember 
   everyone he meets, before he storms out of the Inspector's office. 
   Alberto becomes front page news as the major suspect in the string of 
   murders. As we well know, in giallo films, the person we suspect the 
   most of being the killer usually isn't. Alberto gets a phone call 
   from Marta (Nerina Montagnani), an old lady who tells him that for 
   $2,000 she will tell him who the killer is. Before Alberto can get 
   her the money, Marta is savagely killed by the razor-wielding killer 
   (she grabs the razor with her hand before he slices her throat, 
   leaving a deep gash in her hand). Alberto goes to the Inspector with 
   a recording of Marta's phone message and asks if the Inspector is 
   going to pick her up. The Inspector replies, &quot;Yeah, in a meat 
   wagon!&quot; Alberto couldn't look more guilty if he tried.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Marco playing piano as a dancer, with the smallest 
   breasts I have ever seen on a grown woman, prances around him and 
   Lidia. Lidia then gets a phone call from her twin sister Sylvia (also 
   played by Anuska Borova) because she has something important to tell 
   her concerning Marco, but she blows her sister off (Why can't people 
   tell important news over the phone?). We the see the black-gloved 
   killer slicing the neck of a dancer named Magda Hopkins (Cristina 
   Tamborra) while she is sleeping in her bed. Marco plays piano while 
   looking at the article on Magda's killing. Lidia strips naked in 
   front of him and they make love.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Inspector tells Alberto that he wants to use Kitty as bait to 
   lure the killer. Kitty agrees to do it because Magda was her friend. 
   We then see Kitty dressed as a prostitute, walking the streets of 
   Rome's dirtier district (When she asks for $100 from a creep who 
   tries to pick her up, he says, &quot;For a hundred bucks I could get 
   the greatest lay in the world, you stupid whore!&quot; and then he 
   drives away). The Inspector and Alberto are watching her from an 
   unmarked car, but so is the killer, who is watching her from the 
   shadows of night. When Kitty thinks she is getting into the killer's 
   car (She holds up his cane), the Inspector and some police cars block 
   his way, only it turns out to be the Chief of Police (Orlando 
   Baralla) and the Inspector ends up with egg on his face (Everyone 
   seems to have a cane!).</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Lidia thinks she has the story of her career when she locates Nina 
   Ferretti (Rosita Torosh), the woman who was the chestnut vendor's 
   customer during the original murder, but when Nina arrives at the 
   dance academy to talk to Lidia, she sees a framed photo on a desk, 
   screams and runs away. She drives to a phone booth and calls the 
   police, telling the Inspector that she know who the killer is (But 
   she doesn't tell him who it is over the damn phone!). Before Nina can 
   make it to the Police Department, the killer is waiting for her in 
   the backseat of her car, strangling her <A HREF="tormentor_1972_italy_ads.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/death carries a cane spain poster small.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="306" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>and
    then slicing her throat (The film's most inventive scene, as the

    Alberto thinks he has it all figured out, since all the murdered 
   women were dancers. Alberto sets up a trap with the help of Kitty and 
   the dance academy secretary (Anna Liberati), who was Magda's lesbian 
   lover (!), but first they must stop while Kitty takes a bathroom 
   break (She says, &quot;It must be the emotion. I've gotta go 
   pee-pee!&quot;), twice! Just who is the killer? I'll never tell, but 
   it doesn't take a genius to figure it out because there are so few 
   red herrings here.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Besides some highly risible dialogue (the dubbers were having loads 
   of fun here) and Kitty unable to control her bladder during the 
   finale, this is a fairly entertaining giallo flick. Shot under the

    CARRIES A CANE</A></B> (a much better title than the review title, 
   since there isn't much tormenting going on), this film concludes with 
   a tense finale in a greenhouse, where the Inspector shoots the killer 
   just as he is about to murder Kitty and then we hear a long-winded 
   explanation from Lidia on what the killers' motivation was (it's 
   quite unbelievable, but adheres to giallo conventions).</FONT></FONT><BR>

   (1973) -</B> This is one of the best giallo films ever made. I know 
   that's a pretty big statement and a lot of people are going to 
   disagree with me (hell, I review dozens of giallo films on this site 
   and I usually love them all), but this film, especially in its 
   original Italian uncut form (which is a mix of English language and 
   Italian/with English subtitles), deals with sexuality and, 
   especially, sexual violence, in such a frank and brutal way, once you 
   watch it (and I mean really WATCH it, not put it on while you are 
   doing something else), you will never forget it. The film opens at a 
   photo-shoot (or rather, a secret photo-shoot), where we see Carol 
   (Cristina Airoldi) and Flo (Patrizia Adiutori) making love to some 
   unknown man as the camera clicks away. An eyeless doll hides one of 
   the girl's private parts, as we see the man striking the doll's hair 
   and <A HREF="torso_1973.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/torso-cry rape ad mat12 small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="183" HEIGHT="301" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="2"></A>sticking
    his fingers into its empty eye sockets (How's that for symbolism?). 
   We then switch to Italian Professor Franz (John Richardson; <B><A HREF="short reviews a-m.htm#Frankenstein 80">FRANKENSTEIN
    '80</A></B> - 1972), who is teaching a class on painter Perugino and 
   his fascination with St. Sebastian, as the camera pans across the 
   students in the class (Cinematographer Giancarlo Ferrando has a way 
   of making all the girls look innocent, while the men and male teens 
   look like they are hiding something or leer like sexual perverts. 
   You'll be seeing a lot of both in this film). After the lecture is 
   over, students Jane (Suzy Kendall; <B><A HREF="#Spasmo">SPASMO</A></B> 
   - 1974), Daniela (Tina Aumont; <B><A HREF="lifespan_1974.htm">LIFESPAN</A></B> 
   - 1974) and Stefano (Roberto Bisacco; <B><A HREF="science fiction.htm#Hands Of Steel">HANDS
    OF STEEL</A></B> - 1986) confront Franz on why he was so harsh in 
   his assessment of Perugino's later career. Franz gives a brief 
   explanation and leaves, but to the viewer, we see that both Jane and 
   Franz are interested in each other. Stefano ask Daniela if he can 
   give her a lift home, but she brushes him aside, saying she is going 
   home with Jane. Stefano looks really mad (as do two motorcycle thugs 
   standing next to him) and then, for some reason, seems to follow Flo 
   and her boyfriend John (Fausto De Bella) as they drive off, which 
   Daniela notices. The next time we see Flo and John, they are parked 
   at an abandoned building making out in the car. John then notices 
   someone in a gray ski mask and black leather gloves (a giallo staple) 
   is watching them. He gets out of the car and chases the stranger, but 
   when John doesn't return, Flo gets nervous, turns on the car's 
   headlights and gets out to look for him. The black-gloved stranger 
   reaches into the car and turns off the lights, so Flo returns to a 
   car, only for the stranger to strangle Flo with a red &amp; black 
   patterned scarf, fondle her breasts and then graphically cut open her 
   chest with a knife. As the camera pans back we see John's dead body, 
   his throat slit wide open (a really graphic image, especially for 
   1973), as the shot expertly turns to daytime with Inspector Martino 
   (Luciano De Ambrosis) and his squad hovering around John's body. He 
   interviews a bum who discovered the body, but gets nowhere with him 
   (The bum tells the Inspector that he was about to take a crap 
   outside, but once he saw John's dead body, he became constipated!). 
   We then see the mysterious Roberto (Luc Merenda; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#KidnapSyndicate">KIDNAP
    SYNDICATE</A></B> - 1975) buying the same exact patterned scarf that 
   killed Flo from street vendor Gianni (Ernesto Colli; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#Autopsy1973">AUTOPSY</A></B> 
   - 1973), while he and Gianni leer at the miniskirt-wearing Carol, who 
   once hearing of her friend Flo's death, screams out &quot;No! 
   No!&quot; and runs away. Because of Flo's untimely death, classes are 
   closed for the day at the University, so Franz asks Jane if she would 
   like to get a drink with him, which she readily accepts. Franz tells 
   Jane that he is pleasantly surprised that an American could show so 
   much interest in Perugino (you really should Google him) and Jane 
   replies that she doesn't know whether to take that as a compliment or 
   an insult. Franz and Jane hit it off rather nicely and, as this 
   meeting ends, Franz asks her to go to a music concert with him in the 
   near future and she says yes. As Jane is walking to her car, she 
   notices Carol arguing with Daniele's Uncle Nino (Carlo Alighiero; <B><A HREF="#CatONineTails1971">THE
    CAT O' NINE TAILS</A></B> - 1971) and hears Nino say that he wants 
   to break-off his relationship with Carol because of the circumstances 
   going on, it could become public knowledge and ruin him. Nino then 
   spots Jane and drives away quickly. Stefano picks up a hooker 
   (Rosaria della Femmina) from the street and they go back to her 
   place. When he is unable to perform, the hooker calls him 
   &quot;queer&quot;, which seems to set off a trigger where Stefano 
   becomes violent, slapping the hooker and then putting his hands 
   around her neck, but somehow stops himself from strangling her. 
   Carol, who is acting extremely jittery, spots Roberto leering at her 
   (there's a lot of leering going on in this film) through a cafe 
   window, and then blows-off Daniela, instead jumping on the back of a 
   motorcycle of one of the two thugs we saw earlier in the film. We see 
   Carol smoking a joint at the party, while the two motorcycle thugs 
   fondle her breasts, When they try unbuttoning her pants, she pushes 
   their hands away and tells them no. She then leaves the party and 
   ends up in a foggy marsh, with the two thugs jumping on their 
   motorcycles trying to find her (One of them says, &quot;I'll strangle 
   that bitch!&quot;), until one falls off his bike and they decide it's 
   not worth the trouble. The ski-masked killer is not so forgiving, 
   though, as he strangles Carol with the same patterned scarf that 
   killed Flo, only this time he graphically pokes her eyes out with his 
   fingers (subliminal frames pop-up showing the fingers going into the 
   doll like we saw in the beginning of the film) before he fondles her 
   breasts and cuts open her chest. Inspector Martino is clueless and 
   appeals to the University students to offer up some clues. Daniele 
   tells Jane that the last time she saw Carol was when she jumped on 
   the back of a motorcycle and maybe she should tell the Inspector. 
   Jane tells her that she has an over-active imagination and since the 
   two motorcycle thugs are also University students, she shouldn't get 
   them in trouble without more concrete proof. Once at home, Daniele 
   gets a threatening phone call (if you look close enough, you can tell 
   who is making the call), telling her to keep her mouth shut or she 
   will get strangled with a red &amp; black scarf. Her Uncle Nino 
   arrives and when Daniele tells him about the phone call, he tells her 
   that she should take a few of her female friends to his country 
   estate for the weekend for some rest and relaxation. Before Daniele 
   and her friends go to the country estate (Jane has something to do 
   and will join them later), Daniele is nearly sexually assaulted by 
   Stefano (who professes his love for her, saying she and him were 
   meant to be together forever), and Gianni the scarf seller, after 
   being interviewed by Inspector Martino, makes a phone call to someone 
   saying that he has to sell his business (it's obviously a blackmail 
   call). The next time we see Gianni, he is stuffing two bundles of 
   cash into his sports-coat, but someone driving a car crushes Gianni's 
   head over and over with the bumper of his car against a stone wall 
   (it's the first time in quite a while that I nearly turned my eyes 
   away because this scene is so graphic and that's quite a 
   compliment!). Now that we have enough red herrings to fill a sardine 
   can, including Uncle Nino, who leers at his nearly naked niece while 
   she is getting a neck rub from Jane, we have to figure out exactly 
   who the killer is. It could be any man still alive at this point, 
   even the country estate's village idiot (Enrico De Marco). Nearly 
   every male holds some deep dark secret, so it won't be easy to spot 
   the real killer (and I'm not going to tell). I will tell you that the 
   last 25 minutes of the film is a white knuckle ride (and nearly 
   dialogue-free), as the late-arriving Jane falls down a flight of 
   stairs and sprains her ankle, so when the killer arrives and murders 
   all the girls in the house, he has no idea Jane is in an upstairs 
   bedroom knocked out with a sleeping pill. When Jane wakes up, she 
   watches horrified as the killer (we still don't know who it is, but 
   some of the suspects have been murdered or are revealed as nice guys) 
   cuts up her friends into pieces with a tree branch saw (really 
   graphic) and stuffs their body parts in a burlap sack so he can bury 
   them outside. Will Jane survive or succumb to the killer? I've given 
   you all the clues to figure it out, so it is up to you to discover 
   the answer to that question.&nbsp; Brilliantly directed and

   usually relegated to porn films. While there is plenty of beautiful 
   full frontal nudity, including lesbian lovemaking, nude sunbathing 
   and naked swims in the country estate's lake, much of the nudity is 
   used for opposite effect, showing how some women use their sexuality 
   to get what they want. Only in this film, they pay for such sins with 
   their lives and Martino doesn't pull away when the violence happens. 
   Those who saw this film in U.S. theaters in the R-Rated version are 
   in for a treat, as the widescreen Blue Underground Blu-Ray offers us 
   two versions of the film: The 90 minute unedited English cut and the 
   93 minute Italian cut, which is the preferable way of watching it. 
   Most of the Italian version is in English, but what isn't is in 
   Italian with English subtitles. The copious nudity and graphic 
   violence is really an eye-opener, much of it missing from the U.S. 
   theatrical version and all VHS tapes. The Italian cut offers the film 
   with its original Italian title, &quot;<I><B><A HREF="torso_1973_italy_dvd.htm">I
    Corpi Presentano Tracce Di Violenza Carnale</A></B></I>&quot;, which 
   translates to &quot;The Body Shows Traces Of Carnal Violence&quot;. 
   It's a much better title than the well-known English one because it 
   conveys exactly what you are about to see when you put your Blu-Ray 
   into the player. The killings are unflinching and very graphic for 
   the time. It blows away anything you see in <B><A HREF="friday_the_13th_1980.htm">FRIDAY
    THE 13TH</A></B>, made seven years later, out of the water. The 
   killer's motivation has to do with the way he sees women. As a child, 
   he saw his younger brother fall off a cliff and die while trying to 
   retrieve a female friend's doll, so he equates women with dolls and 
   death, cutting their limbs off as easy as pulling the legs and arms 
   off a doll (and poking their eyes out, too!). There are also some 
   great POV shots and beautiful sweeping photography (pay attention to 
   the scene where Jane leaves Franz after having a drink with him and 
   then going to her car and try not to be impressed). The last 25 
   minutes will have you gripping your chair until your knuckles are 
   white, as Jane tries to find a way to alert the town below that she 
   is in trouble (First using a mirror in the sun to try and get 
   someone's attention from her bedroom window, but it doesn't work). 
   There's a scene where Jane tries to retrieve the key from the other 
   side of the locked door (using the old &quot;newspaper slid under the 
   door while she pokes the key with a hairpin to make it drop on the 
   newspaper&quot; trick) that will have you shitting your pants when 
   you think she has failed, but it has only alerted the killer that she 
   is in the house and he puts the key on the newspaper. If you want a 
   good, old-fashioned murder mystery, look somewhere else. But if you 
   want a take-no-mercy, nudity-filled, graphic and brutal look at a 
   sexual deviate on a killing spree, you can do no better than <B><A HREF="torso_1973b.htm">TORSO</A></B>

    VISITATION</A><A NAME="Visitation"></A> (2005) -</B> This 
   supernatural thriller starts off on a strong note, but soon 
   deteriorates once it reveals it's religious agenda. Pentacostal 
   priest Travis Jordan (Martin Donovan) lost his faith three years 
   earlier when his wife was brutally murdered by an unknown serial 
   killer (he carves numbers into his victims' bodies while crucifying 
   them). Suddenly a mysterious stranger by the name of Brandon Nichols 
   (Edward Furlong) enters the town of Antioch and a series of 
   &quot;miracles&quot; begin to occur: Travis' dead and buried dog 
   comes back to life. New town vetenarian Morgan Elliott (Kelly Lynch) 
   gets into a serious car accident and walks away without a scratch. 
   Brandon holds an old-fashioned town tent revival and begins healing 
   people with serious health issues (a paraplegic can suddenly walk; a 
   woman's cancer is cured; etc.) <A HREF="visitation_2005b.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/visitation dvd front small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="137" HEIGHT="194" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>as
    long as they profess their love and devotion to him. The 
   townspeople, including once-suspicious Sheriff Brett Henchle (Richard 
   Tyson), who had an inoperable brain tumor until Brandon laid his 
   hands on him, begin to worship Brandon as the Second Coming of 
   Christ, but Travis has severe doubts about Brandon's (and the trio of 
   black trenchcoat-wearing strangers he brought with him) motives. He's 
   right, of course. The people Brandon &quot;healed&quot; begin acting 
   violently (even Travis' dog) and begin attacking all those who oppose 
   or doubt Brandon's powers, as Travis and Morgan, who's son Michael 
   (Noah Segan) is also under Brandon's spell, join forces and dig 
   (literally) for the truth. It also seem Brandon's healings don't last 
   very long and those people cured must go back to Brandon and ask for 
   more healing, which requires more of their soul. Travis must regain 
   his faith in God, as his investigation reveals that when Brandon was 
   a child, his preacher father crucified him on a fence for asking help 
   from a rival preacher (his father was sexually abusing him) and 
   Brandon made a deal with the Devil for his release. The Devil gave 
   Brandon temporary healing powers as long as he kills one believer in 
   God every three years and one of Brandon's victims was Travis' wife. 
   Now, Travis must save new love Morgan from becoming Brandon's latest 
   victim and also save Antioch from eternal damnation.&nbsp; Based of

   preacher), <B><A HREF="visitation_2005b.htm">THE VISITATION</A></B>

   when the Christian imagery becomes abundantly clear and the pretty 
   flimsy CGI (swarms of insects come flying out of the mouths of those 
   possessed) start taking center stage. If Martin Donovan's character

   to Mel Gibson's in M. Night Shyamalan's <B><A HREF="signs_2002.htm">SIGNS</A></B>

   (Giovanni Vannini) tells his assistant Santoro (Gianfranco Bullo; <B><A HREF="salon_kitty_1976.htm">SALON
    KITTY</A></B> - 1976) to leave the keys in the door, he will lock up 
   for the night. Earlier, Biagio phoned a woman named Esmeralda to tell 
   her he has received another threatening letter, the third one this 
   week. He then burns the letter and as he gets ready to lock up, 
   Biagio discovers the keys are no longer in the door and realizes he 
   is not alone in the pharmacy. He makes a final phone call, but 
   suddenly hears a noise and hangs up. Someone hits him over the head 
   and as he lays unconscious on the floor, the killer slits his throat 
   with a switchblade knife (As the killer strikes, we get a couple of 
   frames of a cat's eyes flashing on screen, almost subliminally, as if 
   to suggest the killer has cat's eyes; this will happen during every 
   murder in the film). Just as Biagio is being murdered, cabaret dancer 
   Mara (Tedesco; <B><A HREF="silent_action_1975.htm">SILENT ACTION</A></B> 
   - 1975) tells a cab driver to stop at the pharmacy, she needs to pick 
   up some aspirin for her headache. Just as she is about to open the 
   pharmacy door, the killer forces it shut and tells her (in a disguise 
   voice) that they are closed for the night. Even though Mara never 
   sees the killer's face as he sneaks out the door while she walks back 
   to the cab, another female customer enters the pharmacy and discovers 
   Biagio's dead body, running outside and screaming that a murder has 
   been committed. For reasons I still cannot fathom, the killer decides 
   to put Mara on his kill list, even though she never saw his face 
   (Yes, she did hear his voice, but it is highly obvious that he 
   disguised it when talking to her!). The killer watches from his car 
   as Mara gets into the taxi and follows her home, now knowing where 
   she lives.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At the nightclub where she works, Mara runs into old friend Carlo 
   (Paolo Malco; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NewYorkRipper1982">THE NEW 
   YORK RIPPER</A></B> - 1982), a screenwriter she hasn't seen for some 
   time (&quot;I was away for a while.&quot;). Carlo and a director 
   named Michele (Roberto Antonelli; <B><A HREF="smiling_maniacs_1975.htm">SMILING
    MANIACS</A></B> - 1975) are trying o convince Mara to star in a 
   movie they are making; Carlo has written the main role just for her. 
   Mara tells them she hasn't had time to read it yet and will make up 
   her mind once she does, which doesn't sit too well with Carlo. Carlo 
   is also none-too-happy that Mara is dating Lukas (Pani; <B><A HREF="secrets_of_a_call_girl_1973.htm">SECRETS
    OF A CALL GIRL</A></B> - 1973; <B><A HREF="gambling_city_1975.htm">GAMBLING
    CITY</A></B> - 1975), a music studio sound engineer and habitual 
   cigar smoker (and proud of it). It is easy to see that Carlo has a 
   romantic interest in Mara, but she's not interested. That night, when 
   Mara goes home and goes to sleep, the killer sneaks into her 
   apartment (lots of the killer's POV shots), but a neighbor's barking 
   dog enters Mara's apartment, waking her up and chasing the killer 
   away. Mara is scared silly, so she goes to live with Lukas for a 
   short while, telling him that someone wants to kill her, but Lukas 
   thinks she's just being a little paranoid. The next morning, as they 
   are walking out of Lukas' apartment, they meet neighbor Giovanni 
   Bozzi (Fernando Cerulli; <B><A HREF="thriller part 2.htm#SlaughterHotel1971">SLAUGHTER
    HOTEL</A></B> - 1971), who is with a woman. Lukas tells Mara this is 
   the first time he saw Bozzi with a woman, because he is gay, but why 
   is Santoro standing outside the apartment building? The woman that 
   Bozzi is with is actually Esmeralda Messori (Bianca Toccafondi), the 
   same woman Biagio was talking to on the phone just before he was 
   murdered. Esmeralda tells Bozzi that Biagio was a wreck, &quot;beaten 
   down&quot; by the threatening letters he was receiving, reminding 
   Bozzi that they are just like the threatening phone calls he is 
   receiving. Bozzi tells her it is just a coincidence, since he is a 
   loan shark and threatening phone calls are just one part of his 
   profession (he records all his phone calls just to play it safe). As 
   they are talking, Bozzi receives another threatening phone call and 
   he records it. Though no one speaks, both Bozzi and Esmeralda hear a 
   dog barking and people screaming, but what can it mean? (It does 
   remind them of something, though, as we can see on their faces).</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Bozzi brings the tape of the phone message to Lukas, knowing he is a 
   recording engineer at a music studio, hoping he will pick up some 
   auditory clues on the tape that will reveal who is sending them. 
   Lukas brings Bozzi and the tape to the studio, where he and another 
   engineer filter out certain sound frequencies on the tape, revealing 
   that the dog barking on it is actually a Doberman pincer. What they 
   don't know is that someone has followed Lukas and Bozzi to the 
   studio. While they are listening to the tape, Bozzi sees someone in 
   the studio that scares him and when that person sees Bozzi, he walks 
   away quickly. Bozzi excuses himself and leaves, telling Lukas that 
   listening to the tape over-and-over upsets him, but it is apparent 
   that seeing that unknown man is what really upsets him.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then see Esmeralda at home cooking a meal in the oven, when she 
   notices that someone has slipped an envelope under her front door. 
   When she opens the envelope and sees what is inside it, an old photo 
   of two women and two children, with two of the faces cut out, 
   Esmeralda realizes she has the same photo. She slides her photo under 
   the one she just received, revealing the faces of the woman and child 
   who were cut out, but what does it mean? The killer then sneaks into 
   Esmeralda's house and kills her by sticking her head in the meal she 
   is cooking in the oven until the skin on her face turns a crispy 
   golden brown. Esmeralda is barely alive at this moment, so the killer 
   pulls out his switchblade and stabs her in the mouth as she is lying 
   on the floor. The killer then takes the photo and walks away.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then discover that Bozzi loaned Santoro money, but Santoro is 
   having trouble paying his monthly vig, which doesn't make Bozzi 
   happy, telling Santoro he needs the money right away. When Santoro 
   leaves his office, Bozzi hears over the radio that Esmeralda was 
   found murdered. Bozzi knows that he is next on the killer's list, so 
   he goes to the parking garage and finds that his car is blocked in by 
   a van parked too close to it. Mara offers to move Bozzi's car, 
   telling him she's an excellent driver and she can maneuver his car 
   around the van. Bozzi tells her to be careful not to scratch his car, 
   but when she successfully removes it from the space, the killer 
   strikes, forcing Mara to totally destroy Bozzi's car, but she gets 
   away, apologizing to Bozzi for wrecking his car but saying someone 
   just tried to kill her. Bozzi corrects her, saying the killer was 
   after him, the killer thinking he was in the car. When Lukas finds 
   out what has happened, he turns amateur detective. Bozzi hands Lukas 
   the tape of the latest threatening call he has received and tells 
   Lukas that he is leaving for Padua to get away from the killer and 
   hide out. When Lukas listens to the tape, he hears the killer mention 
   Biagio, Esmeralda and Bozzi in the same breath, so he knows they are 
   all connected in some way. Lukas does some digging and discovers all 
   three were members of a jury five years ago that convicted an 
   innocent man named Pasquale Ferrante to a life behind bars for a 
   murder he didn't commit. And he escaped from prison two months ago 
   and still hasn't been found. Is it possible that he is the killer? As 
   we know by watching giallo films, the prime suspect is least likely 
   to be the killer, which Lukas discovers when questioning Pasquale's 
   wife (Cristina Piras) and Pasquale (Franco Citti; <B><A HREF="action.htm#LiveLikeA Cop">LIVE
    LIKE A COP, DIE LIKE A MAN</A></B> - 1976) himself, so Lukas must 
   start from the beginning, starting with the Judge (Giuseppe 
   Addobbati; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#EerieMidnight1974">THE EERIE 
   MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW</A></B> - 1974) who presided over Pasquale's 
   trial. When Bozzi ends up dead by the killer's hands when he is 
   taking a bath, Lukas must discover the truth before the killer 
   murders Mara. So who is the killer? Readers of this site know I never 
   give that away, but I will tell you it has to do with the end of 
   World War II, a Nazi sympathizer and the son of a victim of Nazi 
   abuse (the cut-out faces in the photo being the victim's dead wife 
   and other son), all of whom we have seen in the film. Think you know 
   who it is?</FONT></FONT><BR>

   charms and some flat-out weird sequences. One such sequence shows 
   Lukas searching an abandoned mansion based on some clues he picks up 
   on when he runs into some mute crazy man who mumbles loudly with his 
   tongue sticking out of his mouth. It's both funny and frightening at 
   the same time and Lukas does the right thing by beating a hasty 
   retreat out of there. There's another very weird scene where Lukas 
   walks into an apartment and sees a young man playing the piano while 
   a zaftig woman sings opera. What's weird is what Lukas sees: a bunch 
   of elderly women sitting together on a couch, all of them sound 
   asleep. He tries waking up one of the women to ask her some questions 
   (the exact same photo that we saw with Esmeralda sits on a table next 
   to her), but she keeps falling asleep in the middle of talking. Lukas 
   then gets the information he needs from the woman's caretaker. The 
   main problem with this film is that you can clearly see who the 
   killer is in the film when a shot is shown of him wearing a black 
   veil. Thanks to the HD quality of DVD &amp; Blu-Ray, the black veil 
   doesn't hide the killer's identity, but you may miss it if you are 
   not giving the film 100% of your attention (as some people are 
   accustomed to doing). Seeing the killer's face destroys the mystery 
   (but not totally), but if you look away from this sequence, you are 
   more than likely to enjoy this film more, especially the effective <A HREF="watch_me_when_i_kill_1977.htm#OST">music
    soundtrack</A> from prog-rock group Trans Europa Express, their only 
   film soundtrack. Giallo enthusiasts are more than likely to groan 
   when the killer's identity is revealed during the finale, as it comes 
   out of left field, no clues supplied during the film's entire running 
   time. You will feel cheated, especially what happens to him when it 
   is revealed he's the prime suspect's son, the father shooting him and 
   then committing suicide in front of Lukas and Mara (Believe me, I'm 
   giving nothing away). But this is unlike most giallo films because 
   there is no police involvement whatsoever, no Inspectors, no 
   detectives, nothing (except for a brief scene of police entering the 
   hotel in Padua where Bozzi was murdered). When Lukas tells Mara that 
   she needs to go to the police and tell them everything, she calls the 
   police &quot;stupid&quot; and says they ask too many ridiculous 
   questions, so she would rather handle it her way. In this film, Lukas 
   acts like a police inspector, asking everyone questions and gathering 
   clues (He deduces Pasquale couldn't be the killer because he is 
   left-handed, based on how two coffee cups are positioned on his 
   wife's <A HREF="watch_me_when_i_kill_1977.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/watch me when i kill italy poster2a small.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="305" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>kitchen
    table! His deductive mind is better than most police detectives!). 
   Lukas even makes a Nazi/World War II connection based on the Doberman 
   barking on the tape, talking to a ceramics storeowner and seeing one 
   of the suspects walking into a synagogue! It's a mighty huge leap in 
   logic, but he turns out to be correct. There are lots of jump scares, 
   some of them very effective and some of them downright stupid, such 
   as Mara purposely jumping out of the shadows to scare Lukas. No one 
   in their right mind would do this when a killer is after them! In the 
   rather large canon of giallo films, this one can be considered a 
   minor entry, but with some caveats. The exotic Padua, Italy scenery 
   is a plus, as is the music score and some sadistic killings (Bozzi's 
   murder is especially well orchestrated and is the film's most stylish 
   set-piece), so it's not a total loss. Just don't expect to be wowed 
   and you may have a good time with this film.</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Grannie's demise (Johnny's favorite hangout is the graveyard, where 
   he sits opposite his grandfather's tombstone. Next to it is a blank 
   tombstone, where Jill writes &quot;Gran!!&quot; on it in lipstick). 
   Gran and Johnny have differences of opinion about the way Johnnie 
   lives his life (She wants him to get a job and he see no use in it), 
   but Johnny is able to control her by catering to her every need and 
   scaring the wits out of her with fake stories about &quot;Youth 
   Power&quot; (In one telling scene, Gran and Johnny are watching a 
   riot on TV involving police and young people. Gran says, &quot;Young 
   people. Why don't they wait?&quot; Johnny replies, &quot;No one waits 
   today, Gran. There's no guarantee there'd be anything to wait 
   for.&quot;). Johnny hopes to scare Gran into a fatal heart attack by 
   continually telling her untrue horror stories about how young people 
   are taking over the world and making decisions about the fate of the 
   elderly, using scare tactics like cutting stories out of the 
   newspaper (that have nothing to do with &quot;Youth Power&quot;, but 
   making her believe they do) or having Jill call her on the phone, 
   pretending to be the Census Bureau and asking Gran her age. Pretty 
   soon, Johnny has Gran so scared, she refuses to take her heart 
   medication (he tells her that the leading source of friction between 
   the young and the elderly is that modern medicine makes the elderly 
   live too long, robbing the young of their future), but the old bird 
   refuses to kick the bucket, no matter how many horror stories he 
   tells her. Jill becomes impatient with Johnny's progress (they 
   originally agreed on a five year &quot;schedule&quot; to get Gran six 
   feet under) and they finally get Gran to have a fatal heart attack 
   (how they do it is quite fascinating), but like all perfect murders, 
   mistrust between Johnny and Jill leads to their downfall, especially 
   when Gran gets her revenge at the reading of her will.&nbsp; This is 
   a very British production that is basically a three-character play, 
   with 85% of the film taking place in Gran's house. Director Bill Bain 
   (this is his only theatrical film, although he had directed many 
   episodes of British TV, including episodes of <B><A HREF="avengers_tv_series.htm">THE
    AVENGERS</A></B> [1961 - 1969], <B><A HREF="protectors_tv_series_1972-1973.htm">THE

   52 in 1982) and screenwriter Roger Marshall (<B><A HREF="and_now_the_screaming_starts_1973.htm">AND
    NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS</A></B> - 1973) break-up the 
   &quot;staginess&quot; of the production by visualizing Johnny's 
   daydreams, such as when he imagines himself in a Nazi uniform and 
   orders a bunch of soldiers to gun down a line of old people standing 
   next to a wall or when he dreams that he has a machinegun and shoots 
   Gran in her bed. Johnny's psychological torture of Gran is about as 
   cruel (and original) as you'll see in any film, whether it's writing 
   &quot;Out With The Oldies&quot; on a neighbor's wall so Gran can see 
   it out her window; frightening her with made-up stories of old people 
   being carted away by the youth movement; or the final, fatal straw: 
   when Johnny and Jill stage a mock youth protest in front of her home, 
   making Gran believe they are coming for her and giving her a fatal 
   heart attack. Like all good psychological thrillers, there's a nasty 
   sting after Gran's death (I won't spoil it here) that sets the stage 
   for a fitting finale. If you get a chance to catch this film (it can 
   be downloaded from some popular torrent sites), by all means do so, 
   because, besides some dated verbal slang, clothing and hairstyles, 
   this is about as satisfying as thrillers get. Also starring Peter 
   Copley, Peter Jeffrey, George Benson, Angela Down, Patricia Fuller, 
   Renee Roberts and Lillian Walker. Originally <B>Rated PG</B>, but the 
   version I viewed restored some minor nudity, violence and language 
   that was cut for its U.S. theatrical release.</FONT></FONT></P>

   and the the quick reflection of a knife in the early morning sun, as 
   the killer stabs the young woman between her legs. Enrico thinks it 
   is all in Elizabeth's head, as he saw nothing. Elizabeth is sure of 
   what she saw, but when Enrico refuses to believe her, she leaves on 
   her bicycle and peddles her ass back to her dorm building (with 
   Enrico following her and smiling in his car). Once at his home, 
   Enrico hears on the radio that a young girl was found murdered in the 
   park, but before he can hear any more, his wife Herta (Karin Baal; <B><A HREF="dead_eyes_of_london_1961.htm">DEAD
    EYES OF LONDON</A></B> - 1961), changes the station. Telling his 
   wife nothing, Enrico drives to the park and is shocked to discover 
   that the murdered girl is Hilda, a student who was a member of his 
   gymnastics team. When he arrives at the school late (telling Herta, 
   who is also a teacher at the school, that his car broke down), Enrico 
   is surprised to see that Police Inspector Barth (Joachim Fuchsberger; <B><A HREF="zombie_walks_1968.htm">THE
    ZOMBIE WALKS</A></B> - 1968; <B><A HREF="school_of_fear_1969.htm">SCHOOL
    OF FEAR</A></B> - 1969) is waiting in his office to talk to him. 
   Since Hilda was a member of his gymnastics team,The Inspector asks 
   him if there was any trouble in the young girl's life. Enrico says he 
   cannot think of anything, even though Herta looks at him suspiciously 
   and someone is spying on him through an opening in his office door. 
   Enrico then meets Elizabeth and tells her not to say anything to 
   anyone about their affair. Later that day, Herta throws a newspaper 
   at Enrico, the front page showing a photo of him standing on a bridge 
   at the park when he went there earlier to check on the dead girl. 
   Herta now knows that he didn't have car trouble, but how much does 
   she really know?</FONT></FONT><BR>

    Enrico has a talk with his gymnastics team, where one student, Janet 
   Bryant (Pilar Castel; <B><A HREF="baron_blood_1972.htm">BARON BLOOD</A></B> 
   - 1972), tells him Hilda was troubled, but she doesn't know why. The 
   Inspector, after seeing Enrico's photo in the newspaper, questions 
   him again, only this time he is more assertive, telling Enrico that 
   he is hiding something and, eventually, he will find out what it is. 
   Enrico says nothing and the Inspector leaves his office. We know 
   Enrico couldn't possibly be the killer, because he has an airtight 
   alibi (that he can't tell anyone), so just who is the killer? The 
   Inspector then questions Hilda's parents, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Erickson, 
   asking them if Hilda had a boyfriend. Mrs. Erickson (Maria Monti; <B><A HREF="horror j - q.htm#NightOfThe Devils72">NIGHT
    OF THE DEVILS</A></B> - 1972) says no, her daughter would have told 
   her and Mr. Erickson (Giancarlo Badessi; <B><A HREF="caligula_1979.htm">CALIGULA</A></B> 
   - 1979) wants to know if his daughter was raped. When Mrs, Erickson 
   leaves his office in tears, the Inspector tells Mr. Erickson yes, 
   Hilda was viciously raped, with a knife between her legs. The 
   students go to the school's church to confess their sins, as we see

    Elizabeth sneaks away on her bicycle to meet Enrico at their new 
   love nest, where we notice that she is being followed by someone in a 
   car. When she gets to the love nest (an apartment Enrico rented just 
   for the two of them), Enrico gets a hang-up phone call, which he says 
   must be a wrong number since no one knows they are there. When he 
   gets home, Herta accuses him of sleeping with Hilda, which he flatly 
   denies. They are then paid another visit by the Inspector, who shows 
   Enrico a pen that was found next to Hilda's dead body. When Herta 
   leaves the room, Enrico confesses that the pen is his and tells him 
   about his affair with Elizabeth and what she saw at the park, begging 
   the Inspector not to tell anyone what he just told him, especially 
   his wife.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The killer then strikes again. Janet gets a phone call from the 
   killer who pretends to be Mr. Erickson and asks her to return a book 
   to him that Hilda had. Janet grabs the book and goes outside her dorm 
   building, where the black-gloved killer grabs her (Janet drops her 
   adorable white kitten, who meows at the killer) and throws Janet in 
   the trunk of his car. The next time we see Janet, her feet are tied 
   together, her hands tied behind her back and her mouth is taped, as 
   the killer drags her by her feet through the park, ripping off her 
   blouse (exposing her breasts) and panties (exposing her 
   you-know-what) and then shoving his big knife up her hooch, killing 
   her. Elizabeth wakes up from a vivid nightmare and remembers 
   something important she saw when Hilda was killed. She calls Enrico 
   and tells him to come over (enraging a sleeping Herta) and when he 
   does, she tells Enrico what she saw (a conversation we are not privy 
   to). The next morning, when she finds out what happened to Janet, 
   Elizabeth has a talk with teacher Prof. Bascombe (G&uuml;nther Stoll; <B><A HREF="hunchback_of_soho_1966.htm">THE
    HUNCHBACK OF SOHO</A></B></FONT></FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"> </FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">-
    1966), who then calls a faculty meeting. Elizabeth tells them that 
   the man who killed Hilda had a beard and wore a long black habit, 
   like a priest. When the school's headmaster, Mr. Leach (Rainer 
   Penkert), asks Elizabeth what she was doing in the park so early in 
   the morning, she replies she was with a boy, which relieves Enrico, 
   who is at the meeting (so is Herta). Mr. Leach then says the boy may 
   have seen something, too, but Elizabeth says no, he didn't even 
   believe her (a not-so-subtle dig at Enrico). Teacher Joseph Kane 
   (John Gayford) asks Elizabeth if she saw the priest's face and she 
   says no (both Father Herbert and Father Webber are at the meeting). 
   After the faculty meeting is over, Enrico thanks Elizabeth for 
   keeping his name out of it and we discover Mr. Leach knows about 
   their affair, telling Enrico he will tell no one else, but he should 
   be more &quot;careful&quot; (Believe me, all these trivial details 
   are important). I know what you are thinking: So who is Solange and 
   what role does she play here? Be patient...</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We are then in the girl's shower (lots of gratuitous full-frontal 
   nudity) and someone is peeping on them through a hole in the wall. 
   Elizabeth is in her love nest taking a bath, when she hears someone 
   entering the apartment. Thinking it is Enrico, she invites him to 
   join her. It is not Enrico at all, but the killer, who drowns 
   Elizabeth in the bathtub and makes a hasty retreat (all of it from 
   the killer's POV). Enrico can hide his affair no longer, as the 
   Inspector arrests him and makes Enrico give him a sample of his hair. 
   The school faculty and the newspapers label Enrico a &quot;sex 
   maniac&quot; (Joseph Kane says to the Inspector, &quot;I never did 
   like that Italian!&quot;). Herta wants to talk to the Inspector, but 
   he tells her, at this moment, he is too busy to talk to her, as he is 
   questioning all the male members of the school (He doesn't believe 
   that Enrico is the killer, even though he arrested him to make the 
   public calm down). When Mr. Leach tells the Inspector what Elizabeth 
   told the faculty about the killer being bearded and wearing a long 
   black habit, he gets down and dirty with everyone, including the 
   priests at the school. When Elizabeth's autopsy reveals that she was 
   still a virgin, the Inspector tells Herta, which takes her by 
   surprise (it takes us all by surprise!). The Inspector releases 
   Enrico from custody and he tells Herta that he must find out who 
   killed Elizabeth, Herta vowing to help her husband.</FONT></FONT><BR>
   <FONT SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Inspector, acting on a tip, interrupts a class Herta is giving 
   and asks the girls if they ever saw a priest with a beard. One of the 
   girls, Susan (the prolific Carla Mancini; <B><A HREF="horror d - i.htm#HangingWoman1973">THE
    HANGING WOMAN</A></B> - 1973), tells the Inspector that she saw 
   Hilda and Janet&nbsp; with a bearded priest, but she does not know 
   his name. When the Inspector leaves, Herta grills the students even 
   more, reporting what she learned to her husband. This leads Enrico to 
   a black photographer (actor unknown), who tells him that all the dead 
   girls were customers of his, wanting him to take nude photos of them 
   (as the photographer is talking to Enrico, a completely nude young 
   girl, who is white as a ghost, is waiting for him to take her 
   photo!). The photographer also tells him that he didn't want the 
   girls to end up like &quot;Solange&quot;.&nbsp; Enrico asks the 
   photographer who Solange is and he replies that she was &quot;some 
   young chick who disappeared&quot; after he took some nude photos of 
   her. This leads Enrico on a troubling journey on discovering who 
   Solange really is and why her disappearance is related to the three 
   current murders. As in all good giallo films, we discover Solange was 
   involved in something very seedy and she is the daughter of someone 
   very close to Enrico. But who could it be? Is it the peeper, who 
   likes to spy on the girls taking showers? Could the peeper be someone

    This Italy/West Germany co-production was the first of 
   director/co-screenwriter Massimo Dallamano's (<B><A HREF="guilty pleasures.htm#SecretDorianGray70">THE

   direct the third and final chapter of his trilogy, as he died in a 
   car accident in Rome in 1976. The film was eventually made, after his 
   screenplay was reworked (he gets a co-screenwriter credit), as <B><A HREF="#RingsOf Fear1978">(RED)

   Inspector. This film has a very complex plot (based, in part, on 
   Edgar Wallace's &quot;The Clue Of The New Pin&quot;), but it is never 
   boring, thanks to a cast of pros (Joachim Fuchsberger appeared in 
   many of <A HREF="edgar_wallace_krimis_1959-1972.htm">West Germany's 
   Edgar Wallace krimi films of the '60s</A> as a law official, my 
   favorite one being <B><A HREF="inn_on_the_river_1962.htm">THE INN ON 
   THE RIVER</A></B> - 1962) and Dallamano's tight direction. Some 
   critics complain that the film is too long (at 103 minutes), but the 
   screenplay, by Dallamano and Bruno Di Geronimo (<B><A HREF="exploitation.htm#FlaviaTheHeretic74">FLAVIA
    THE HERETIC</A></B> - 1974), details Enrico's long journey on 
   discovering the truth and the toll it takes on everyone's lives, time 
   needed to peel back the layers of the story and uncovering the truth. 
   And Dallamano delivers a great giallo film that contains all the 
   ingredients we demand from this genre, namely an unknown black-gloved 
   killer, plenty of eye-opening female nudity, lots of sex and violence 
   and a crackling good mystery. Dallamano was a talent who died way too 
   soon. I wonder how many good films he would have made if he didn't 
   pass on at the age of 59. Also helping this film are Aristide 
   Massaccesi's (a.k.a. &quot;Joe D'Amato&quot;) dream-like photography,

   this film even though it seemed the usual video fodder, at least by 
   the synopsis on the video box. Boy, was I wrong! This is a true 
   unknown sleeper that is must viewing for all mystery fans. When seven 
   severed hands are discovered one rainy night in a Texas town, Police 
   Chief Martin Sheen (doesn&#146;t he ever take a rest?) and his crew 
   try to figure out why the hands (from young girls ages 5-13) were 
   numerically tattooed. Enter a forensic expert (Ally Walker in a 
   knockout performance) to assist the police in solving these crimes. 
   Ally (who has a dark past and a &quot;Don&#146;t mess with me&quot; 
   attitude) methodically fits the pieces of the puzzle together for a 
   really startling (and sick) conclusion. That&#146;s all the plot that 
   I&#146;m going to give away because this is one of the few mystery 
   films that had me fooled and I want you to experience the same jolts 
   that I did on the first viewing. On second viewing, I realized that 
   all the clues were well laid out (some of them are hidden in 
   conversations) but it was possible for the viewer to solve it before 
   the final 15 minutes. God, I love this type of film because you have 
   to use your brain as well as your eyes. You not only watch this film,

   daughter, Roberta (Nicoletta Elmi), at the airport. Roberta has come 
   to spend some quality time with her father since her fashion model 
   mother, Elizabeth (Anita Strindberg), lives in London (Mom and Dad's 
   marriage is going through bit of a rough patch). Franco dotes on 
   Roberta, taking her everywhere, even to the house of his agent, 
   Serafian (Adolfo Celi), where she overhears a heated conversation 
   between a young couple. Serafian also gives her a necklace depicting 
   the zodiac sign of Aquarius, her birth month (February). It's 
   apparent Roberta is being stalked by the same killer who murdered the 
   young girl in France four years earlier (the killer's POV shots looks 
   like the unknown assailant is looking through a black lace veil) and 
   the unthinkable happens. Roberta is abducted on the street while her 
   father is having an afternoon tryst with Gabriella (Rose Marie 
   Lindt), Serafian's beautiful assistant. When Roberta doesn't come 
   home, Franco goes looking for her, but comes up empty. He calls the 
   police and a couple of days later her body is discovered floating in 
   the canals. Elizabeth comes to Venice for the funeral and to try to 
   fix her marriage to a distraught Franco, who blames himself for his 
   daughter's death. When Franco discovers that the death of a young 
   girl a year earlier bears a striking similarity to his daughter's 
   death (both were found floating in the canals and were sexually 
   assaulted), he begins his own investigation (which includes a strange 
   game of ping pong while questioning an informant, who tells Franco, 
   &quot;If you can't play ping pong, don't get mixed-up in 
   politics!&quot;). Franco's investigation will bring him into the 
   world of the rich and influential (involving some of his closest 
   friends), some of who are involved in a string of child molestations, 
   sexual perversions and brutal murders. Gabriella is strangled in a 
   movie theater and one of the main suspects is stabbed to death in his 
   home, but Franco gets some help from the crippled son of a murder 
   victim, who shows him a film that unmasks a society that partakes in 
   sick sex games, some involving children. Franco must find the 
   identity of the individual who's back is only seen in the film, 
   before the killer murders Elizabeth, himself and gets away with a 
   string of child killings that dates back to 1968, where this film

   author Sian Anderson (Meg Foster), who boyfriend John (David

   from her hectic metropolitan lifestyle and rents a house in the 
   ancient (and creepy) seaside Greek village of Monemvassia from a 
   jovial Elias Appleby (Robert Morley). After showing her around the 
   deserted village (most of the occupants are in Switzerland, spending 
   the money they made during tourist season), Elias leaves Sian with a 
   cryptic warning: &quot;Beware of the wind.&quot; Sure enough, as soon 
   as Elias departs, a mysterious howling wind appears and with it 
   enters enigmatic stranger Phil (Wings Hauser), the house's caretaker. 
   Sian's life is about to get strange. Working on her latest mystery 
   novel, Sian (who signs her books with the male pseudonym &quot;Sean 
   Anderson&quot;) imagines Phil killing Elias as she types her next 
   chapter. The problem is, it may all be true, as she spies on Phil

    Sian calls John back in the States for help, but all she gets to 
   tell him is that a murder has been committed before the line goes 
   dead. Sian's extensive knowledge of ways to murder people, thanks to 
   research she has performed for previous novels, makes her believe 
   that Phil is out to kill her. It seems she is right when Phil breaks 
   into the house brandishing a sickle, forcing Sian to barracade

   at a secluded lake deep in the woods. So begins a series of quick 
   flash-forwards that populate the first half of the film, tantilizing 
   and teasing us of the action to come. Old World War&nbsp; II buddies 
   Charlie (Rod Steiger), Wilber (Jerry Harding), George (Richard <A HREF="wolf_lake_1978.htm"><!-- $MVD$:picsz("0","0") --><IMG SRC="https://critcononline.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wolf lake 1978 vhs front small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="248" VSPACE="2" HSPACE="5" BORDER="0"></A>Herd)
    and Sweeney (Paul Mantee) arrive at a secluded lakeside cabin by 
   plane for a hunting trip and meet David, the caretaker. Immediately 
   Charlie makes a wisecrack about David's unkempt appearance, mocking 
   his long hair and beard (calling him a &quot;bearded lady&quot;). 
   Wilbur manages to calm David down and sees that David is quite handy 
   with a rifle, learning that he served in the Marines (or did he?). 
   Wilbur deducts that David is a deserter, waiting deep in the woods 
   for amnesty to come. Wilbur tells David that Charlie lost his son in 
   Vietnam, so he better not find out David's secret.&nbsp; The other 
   three war buddies begin to ogle Linda, who acts as cook and maid in 
   the cabin. Charlie gets on the wrong side of Linda, who lifts up her 
   blouse to taunt Charlie. Charlie gives Linda a slap in the face. 
   Almost immediately Wilbur tells Charlie that David is a deserter 
   (nothing like having a close friend!) and Charlie begins a spiraling 
   plan to taunt David, at first shooting his high-powered rifle near 
   David while he is working on the dock, telling David that he's not 
   going to leave this place alive and culminating in the debasing rape, 
   and eventual death, of Linda. David finally ditches his pacifist ways 
   and begins to systematically kill the four hunters, but not before 
   taking some licks himself. I will not destroy the rest of the film 
   for first-time viewers, and there are about to be many, since this 
   film is not very well-known. Director/writer Burt Kennedy, who 
   usually directed Westerns, does a fine job here in creating tension 
   that finally leads to slaughter. Kennedy did step out of the Western 
   genre now and then, as he also directed the TV movie <B><A HREF="all_the_kind_strangers_1974.htm">ALL

   find out later in the film). David Huffman (<B><A HREF="blood_beach_1981.htm">BLOOD

   Hardin does try to act as the voice of reason in several scenes. This 
   is basically a film about contrasting personalities, one who loves 
   his country so much and is willing to kill for it and one who loves 
   his country so much that he has to kill because of it. The TV version 
   has a completely different ending as the one who died in the original 
   lived and the one who lived, died (and omits all the flash-forward 
   and the rape). <B><A HREF="wolf_lake_1978b.htm">WOLF LAKE</A></B>

   through the forest at night using a crossbow, a machete and a big-ass 
   knife. Encountering spike-filled and other booby traps, the Zero Boys 
   (and girls) fight back, using their war games training to turn the

   - 1987) weakest films, helped in part by the revelation during the 
   middle of the film that the weapons the Zero Boys carry are, in fact, 
   real and not paint guns or blank-filled semi-automatic weapons. To 
   make matters worse, the Zero Boys waste more of their ammunition 
   shooting at objects rather than the hillbillies (they waste over four 
   clips of ammo shooting-up the torture room, when using a pipe or a 
   piece of wood would have accomplished the same thing). Don't get me 
   started on the dynamite and stun guns the Zero Boys have conveniently 
   packed for their fun weekend. To show you how completely embarrassing 
   and unrealistic this film really is, Joe Estevez, who plays the head 
   of the hillbilly can, appears here using the pseudonym &quot;Joe 
   Phelan&quot;, a nom-de-plume he has used several times since (such as 
   Mastorakis' <B><A HREF="terminal_exposure_1987.htm">TERMINAL EXPOSURE</A></B> 
   [1987]). This from an actor that has starred in more than his fair 
   share of crappy films (<B><A HREF="action part 2.htm#ArmedForAction">ARMED
    FOR ACTION</A></B> [1992] anyone?) using his real name. The violence 
   on view is also fairly restrained (arrow impalement, speargun bolt to 
   the leg, death by spiked pit) and the finale, where Jamie tries to 
   electrocute the head hillbilly by shoving her stun gun in a lake, 
   defies all logic. Since most of the violence takes place in the dead 
   of night and the film is woefully underlit, why put yourself the 
   trouble of watching it? A total misfire from beginning to end. Also 
   starring Tom Shell, Nicole Rio, Gary Jochimsen, John Michaels and 
   Elise Turner. Originally released on VHS by <A HREF="video_companies_cover_art.htm#Lightning Video">Lightning
